PREFACE
It was the desire of the late Master of Balliol, Dr. Ben¬
jamin Jowett, as formulated in his will, that the proceeds
from the sale of his works, the copyright in which he
bequeathed to Balliol College, should be used to promote the
study of Greek Literature, especially by the publication of
new translations and editions of Greek authors. In a codicil
to his will he expressed the hope that the translation of
Aristotle’s works begun by his own translation of the Politics
should be proceeded with as speedily' as possible. The
College resolved that the funds thus accruing to them should,
in memory of his services to the College and to Greek
letters, be applied to the subvention of a series of translations
of the works of Aristotle. Through the co-operation, financial
and other, of the Delegates of the University Press it has now
become possible to begin the realization of this design. By
agreement between the College and the Delegates of the Press
the present editors were appointed to superintend the carrying
out of the scheme. The series is published at the joint
expense and risk of the College and the Delegates of the
Press.
<t>
The editors have secured the co-operation of various
scholars in the task of translation. The translations make
no claim to finality, but aim at being such as a scholar might
construct in preparation for a critical edition and commentary.
Wherever new readings are proposed the fact will be indi¬
cated, but notes justificatory of conjectural emendations
or defensive of novel interpretations will, where admitted, be
reduced to the smallest compass.

 PREFACE
The editors, while retaining a general right of revision and
annotation, will leave the responsibility for each translation to
its author.
J. A. S.
W. D. R.
This book has been compiled at various times and at long
intervals during very many years. The translation, which
owes much to my father’s helping hand in years long gone
by, is based upon the text of Bekker ; but in subsequent
revisions I have included all that seemed to me most useful
and appropriate from the texts or textual annotations of
Schneider, Aubert and Wimmer, Piccolos, and Dittmeyer. To
the emendations proposed „by these commentators I have
added some few of my own, which will be found brought
together in a brief appendix. Many of these suggestions of
mine are admittedly venturesome, and but very few of them
have been adopted in my translation ; but they all relate to
passages where the text as it at present stands is in my
opinion faulty, and where conjecture may be a help towards
further consideration and ultimate emendation.
The so-called Tenth Book of the Historia Animalium has
not been translated. It is spurious beyond question, and its
contents have neither general nor particular interest.
My editors have been liberal in allowing me greater scope
of annotation than was contemplated in the outset for the
volumes of this series ; but nevertheless I have felt constrained
to omit much that I had written, especially on the zoological
side of my commentary. To annotate, illustrate, and criticize
Aristotle’s knowledge of natural history is a task without an
end.
Many friends and colleagues have given me abundantly of
their knowledge and advice, and my editors have been
assiduous in all manner of help and counsel.

 PREFATORY NOTE
In the following notes I have taken little account of matters of
geography, but it seems worth while to call attention to the frequent
reference in this book, and in certain other Aristotelian writings, to
the island of Lesbos and to places in and near it (cf. Strabo xiii. 2).
Thus, for instance, we have mention made of Lesbos (H. A. 62ib 22,
G. A. 767ft 1), Antissa (Probl. I303a 34, Oecon. 1347a 25), Arginussa
(H.A. 578b27), Lectum (H.A. 547a 5), Mitylene {Pol. I304a4, 131115 26,
Vent. 973a 11, fr. I52ib 3), Pordoselene {H.A. 6o5b 29), Proconnesus
{Vent. 973a 20> fr* I52ib 13), Pyrrha {G. A. 76313 1), and the Pyrrhaean
Euripus {H.A. 544s 21, 548a 9, 6o3a 21, 62ib 12, P. A. 68ob 1) ; and
I think it, further, not improbable that Makea {H.A. 548^ 25) should
be MaAta, the south-eastern promontory of Lesbos.
We know that Aristotle spent two years in Mitylene, when he was
about forty years old : that is to say, some three years after the death
of Plato, just after his sojourn with Hermias of Atarneus, just prior to
his residence at the court of Philip, and some ten years before he
returned to Athens to begin teaching in the Lyceum (Dion. Hal. Eft. I
ad Ammaeum, p. 727 R). Throughout the Natural History references
to places in Greece are few, while they are comparatively frequent to
places in Macedonia and to places on the coast of Asia Minor, all the
way from the Bosphorus to the Carian coast. I think it can be shown
that Aristotle’s natural history studies were carried on, or mainly
carried on, in his middle age, between his two periods of residence in
Athens; that the calm, landlocked lagoon at Pyrrha was one of his
favourite hunting-grounds ; and that his short stay in Euboea, during
the last days of his life, has left little if any impress on his zoological
writings.
Then it would appear that Aristotle’s work in natural history was
antecedent to his more strictly philosophical work, and it would follow
that we might proceed legitimately to interpret the latter in the light
of the former. And remembering that Speusippus also was a naturalist
(to whose writings on fish and shellfish Athenaeus bears abundant
testimony), we might permit ourselves to surmise that inquiries into
natural history were in no small degree to be reckoned with as a cause
of the modification of Plato’s doctrine, alike, though not identically, at
the hands of Aristotle and of the later Academy.

 BOOK I
I Of the parts of animals some are simple : to wit, all such 486
as divide into parts uniform with themselves, as flesh into
flesh ; others are composite, such as divide into parts not
uniform with themselves, as, for instance, the hand does not
divide into hands nor the face into faces.1
1 Cf. P. A. ii. 1 and 2 ; Theophr. H. PL i.2 ; Ps.-Arist. de Pl. i. 2 and 3. A treatise might be written on the intention and the history of the distinction here drawn by Aristotle, who had derived it from Anaxagoras (cf. Lucret. i. 830 ; Serv. ad Ae?i. iv. 625 ; Cic. Q. Acad. iv. 57 ; Galen, de Dogm. Hipp. v. 450, 673, ed. Kiihn, &c.). The subject is treated more fully in the de Partibus (ii. 1, &c.), where A. distinguishes three degrees of composition or synthesis. The first is composition out of the elements, i< j&v m\. vtto tucov oroi^etW, oiuv yrj$■, dipos, vdaroc, Trvpos: or rather of certain of these, vypuv yap ml ijr/pbv ml Beppov ml \{/vxpbv vXri tu>v awdirow (rcopdraiv iarlv. The second and third stages of synthesis are, in animals, the simple tissues, bone, flesh, and the like, and the organs that are built up of these (cf. Galen, xv. 7 K.). In Meteor, iv. 10 the simple and composite parts of plants and animals are compared with the like categories of inanimate things, the former with such opoiapeprj as gold and silver, tin and iron, ml baa Ik Tovroiv ylyverai. It is noteworthy that, in the Meteorological A. ranks wood and bark among the dvopoiopfpi7, together with root and leaf, face and hand, though flesh and bone, nerve and skin rank only, with fibre and muscle, among the opoiopeprj; in other words, the histological analysis is carried somewhat further on the botanical than on the zoological side. As to sap and juice and fibre and vessel and flesh, these are elementary things, so far as biology conducts us : dpxal yap avrat, rrXrjv A tis \iyoi tas toov cttoixAmv bvvdpus’ airai be KOival ndvroov. 17 pev ovv ovaia Kal rj v\rj (pvais iv tovtois (Theophr., 1. C.). We must pass, as Galen tells us (i. 487 K.), to the de Gen. et Corr. ii, or the de Caelo i, for a discussion of the elements, and of the relation to these of the influences of wet and dry, hot and cold, &c. As Aristotle’s account of the elements remained the groundwork of the mediaeval concep¬ tion of matter, so the older naturalists retained unaltered his distinction of simple and composite parts in the fabric of living things. The opoiop(pl) and bvopoiopeprj are the partes similares s. simplices s. primae, and the partes dissimilares s. instrumentales s. organicae s. officinales, of the naturalists. Wotton, for instance [de Diff. Anini. i. 4; 1552), gives a very fair epitome of the tissues as follows : ‘ Similares numerantur hae, os, cartilago, vena, arteria, nervus, ligamentum, tendo, membrana, caro, adeps, unguis, cutis; his adduntur humores, ut sanguis, et qui in oculo sunt, cristallinus et vitreus humor.’ The division into tissues and organs of Bichat (Anat. generale, 1801) was thus quite on old lines.
AR. H.A, B


 HISTORIA ANIMALIUM
486a
And of such as these, some are called not parts merely,
but limbs or members. Such are those parts that, while
entire in themselves, have within themselves other diverse
io parts : as, for instance, the head, foot, hand, the arm as
a whole, the chest; for these are all in themselves entire
parts, and there are other diverse parts belonging to them.1
All those parts that do not subdivide into parts uniform
with themselves are composed of parts that do so subdivide,
for instance, hand is composed of flesh, sinews, and bones.
15 Of animals, some resemble one another in all their parts,
while others have parts wherein they differ.2 Sometimes
the parts are identical in form or species, as, for instance,
one man’s nose or eye resembles another man’s nose or eye,
flesh flesh, and bone bone ; and in like manner with a horse,
1 P.A. i. 5. 645^ 35. 2 e\ei de twv {ucov. The succeeding passage is not easy to translate, but its meaning seems to me to be exquisitely clear, and its statements to be ordered with an admirable logic. Of animals, some have all their parts alike, each to other, alike in one horse and in another horse, in one man and in another man. Such animals are alike in form or species, and differ only as individuals. Some, again, have the same parts, but the properties or accidents thereof are contrary or opposite, or at least differ in degree. Such animals are alike in kind, or genus, as fishes are or birds, but differ specifically. Moreover, in certain cases, some part altogether new may supervene in one species though lackingin others, like the cock’s comb, which is something singular and unmatched among birds; but we must not unduly estimate the importance of such minor accretions, which leave the totality of the organism insignificantly changed. Thirdly, we may have animals under observation whose parts neither are identical nor differ only by accident or in degree; but which, on the contrary, have an essential unlikeness, and only resemble one another in the way of analogy: for analogy might be described as the likeness between things essentially different, or as being no more than that resemblance which is conferred by similarity of place, use, or general significance. For instance, a bird’s feather is not the same thing as a fish’s scale, nor is the difference one of accident or of degree ; but they are separate things, included under no single concept, and such resemblance as they possess one to another is best described as an analogy; and the creatures that bear them are not of the same genus, but of different genera. While these matters are of chief importance, there is a sort of difference not to be altogether overlooked, the difference of position, in parts that are still manifestly the same: as in the case of teats, that are pectoral in one animal and inguinal in another. Lastly, passing from animals in their integrity to the tissues of which they are composed, these may be classified according to the simpler classifications of elementary things, which fall into such simple categories as solid and fluid, or hard and soft, or wet and dry. Of such simple contrasts, flesh and bone, or blood and artery, are simple instances.


 BOOK I. i 486a
and with all other animals which we reckon to be of one
and the same species : for as the whole is to the whole, so 20
each to each are the parts severally. In other cases the
parts are identical, save only for a difference in the way of
excess or defect, as is the case in such animals as are of
one and the same genus.1 By * genus ’ I mean, for instance,
Bird or Fish, for each of these is subject to difference in
respect of its genus,2 and there are many species of fishes
and of birds.
Within the limits of genera, most of the parts as a rule
exhibit differences through contrast of the property or 486b
accident,3 such as colour and shape, to which they are
subject: in that some are more and some in a less
degree the subject of the same property or accident; and
also in the way of multitude or fewness, magnitude or
parvitude, in short in the way of excess or defect. Thus
in some the texture of the flesh is soft, in others firm ;
some have a long bill,4 others a short one; some have 10
abundance of feathers, others have only a small quantity.
It happens further that some have parts that others have
not: for instance, some have spurs and others not, some
have crests and others not; but as a general rule, most
parts and those that go to make up the bulk of the body 15
are either identical with one another, or differ from one
another in the way of contrast and of excess and defect.
For ‘the more’ and ‘the less’ may be represented as
‘ excess ’ or ‘ defect ’.

 486b HISTORIA ANIMALIUM
Once again, we may have to do with animals whose parts
are neither identical in form nor yet identical save for
differences in the way of excess or defect:1 but they are the
same only in the way of analogy, as, for instance, bone is
20 only analogous to fish-bone, nail to hoof, hand to claw, and
scale to feather ; for what the feather is in a bird, the scale
is in a fish.
The parts,then, which animals severally possess are diverse
from, or identical with, one another in the fashion above
described. And they are so furthermore in the way of
local disposition: for many animals have identical organs
that differ in position ; for instance, some have teats in the
4«7a breast^ others close to the thighs.
Of the substances that are composed of parts uniform
(or homogeneous) with themselves, some are soft and moist,
others are dry and solid. The soft and moist are such either
absolutely or so long as they are in their natural conditions,
as, for instance, blood, serum, lard, suet, marrow, sperm,
gall, milk in such as have it, flesh and the like; and also,
5 in a different way, the superfluities,2 as phlegm and the
excretions of the belly and the bladder. The dry and
solid are such as sinew, skin, vein, hair, bone, gristle, nail,
horn (a term which as applied to the part involves an
ambiguity, since the whole also by virtue of its form is de
io signated horn),3 and such parts as present an analogy to these.

They include not only the excretions of bladder and intestine, but also blood, lard, sperm, gall, milk (though in the present passage these are apparently excluded), and even the eggs of birds. From the TrepiTTiopani are formed bone, sinew, hair, nails, teeth and such like. They seem to be, in A.’s mind, the not-living constituents of the body, the ‘ formed material’, as we say.

 BOOK I. i 487
Animals differ from one another in their modes of sub¬
sistence, in their actions, in their habits, and in their parts.
Concerning these differences we shall first speak in broad
and general terms, and subsequently we shall treat of the
same with close reference to each particular genus.
Differences are manifested in modes of subsistence,
in habits,, in actions performed. For instance, some i5
animals live in water and others on land.1 And of those
that live in water some do so in one way, and some
in another: that is to say, some live and feed in the
water, take in and emit water, and cannot live if deprived
of watei, as is the case with the great majority of
fishes;2 others get their food and spend their days in the 20
water, but do not take in water but air, nor do they bring
forth in the water. Many of these creatures are furnished
with feet, as the otter, the beaver, and the crocodile ; some
are furnished with wings, as the diver and the grebe; some
are destitute of feet, as the water-snake. Some creatures
get their living in the water and cannot exist outside it:
but for all that do not take in either air or water, as, for 25
instance, the sea-nettle and the oyster. And of creatures
that live in the water some live in the sea, some in rivers,
some in lakes, and some in marshes, as the frog and the newt.3'
Of animals that live on dry land some take in air and
emit it, which phenomena are termed ‘inhalation’ and
‘ exhalation ’ ; as, for instance, man and all such land 30
animals as are furnished with lungs. Others, again, do
not inhale air, yet live and find their sustenance on dry
land ; as, for instance, the wasp, the bee, and all other
insects. And by ‘ insects ’ I mean such creatures as have
nicks or notches on their bodies, either on their bellies or
on both backs and bellies.4
And of land animals many, as has been said, derive their 487^
subsistence from the water; but of creatures that live in

 HISTORIA ANIMALIUM
and inhale water not a single one derives its subsistence
from dry land.
Some animals at first live in water, and by and by
change their shape and live out of water, as is the case with
5 river worms,1 for out of these the gadfly2 develops.
Furthermore, some animals are stationary, and some are
erratic. Stationary animals are found in water, but no
such creature is found on dry land. In the water are many
creatures that live in close adhesion to an external object,
as is the case with several kinds of oyster. And, by the
way, the sponge appears to be endowed with a certain
* io sensibility: as a proof of which it is alleged 3 that the
difficulty in detaching it from its moorings is increased if
the movement to detach it be not covertly applied.
Other creatures adhere at one time to an object and de¬
tach themselves from it at other times, as is the case with a
species of the so-called sea-nettle; for some of these creatures
seek their food in the night-time loose and unattached.
Many creatures are unattached but motionless, as is the
15 case with oysters and the so-called holothuria.4 Some can
swim, as, for instance, fishes, molluscs,5 and crustaceans,
such as the crawfish. But some of these last move by
walking, as the crab, for it is the nature of the creature,
though it lives in water, to move by walking.
Of land animals some are furnished with wings, such as
birds and bees, and these are so furnished in different ways
20 one from another; others are furnished with feet. Of the
animals that are furnished with feet some walk, some
creep, and some wriggle.6 But no creature is able only to
move by flying, as the fish is able only to swim, for the
animals with leathern wings can walk ; the bat has feet and
the seal has imperfect feet.7
Some birds have feet of little power, and are therefore

called Apodes} This little bird is powerful on the wing ; 25
and, as a rule, birds that resemble it are weak-footed and
strong-winged, such as the swallow and the drepanis or
(?) Alpine swift; for all these birds resemble one another
in their habits and in their plumage," and may easily be
mistaken one for another. (The apus is to be seen at
all seasons, but the drepanis only after rainy weather in*3^>
summer; for this is the time when it is seen and cap¬
tured, though, as a general rule, it is a rare bird.)
Again, some animals move by walking on the ground as
well as by swimming in water.
Furthermore, the following differences are manifest in
their modes of living and in their actions. Some are
gregarious, some are solitary, whether they be furnished 4-88a
with feet or wings or be fitted for a life in the water; and
some partake of both characters, the solitary and the gre¬
garious. And of the gregarious,1 2 3 some are disposed to com¬
bine for social purposes, others to live each for its own self.
Gregarious creatures are, among birds, such as the
pigeon, the crane, and the swan; and, by the way, no bird
furnished with crooked talons is gregarious. Of creatures that 5
live in water many kinds of fishes are gregarious, such as the
so-called migrants, the tunny, the pelamys, and the bonito.
Man, by the way, presents a mixture of the two
characters, the gregarious and the solitary.
Social creatures are such as have some one common
object in view; and this property is not common to all
creatures that are gregarious. Such social creatures are
man, the bee, the wasp, the ant, and the crane. 10
Again, of these social creatures some submit to a ruler,
1 H.A. ix. 30. 618a31 ; Plin. H.N. x. 39, xi. 47. a^ous-maybe the swift, or perhaps the cliff-martin or sand-martin ; dpevrcivis, lit. ‘ sicklewing’, is, alternatively, either the large alpine, or the common swift; cf. 67. of Gk. Birds, p. 34. 2 opoLonrepa : perhaps rather ‘ in the fashion of their wings’. 3 This passage would be simple and clear were it not for the words to)v ayeXaioov Kal to>v pova8iK(ov. With Schneider (Cur. f>ost. p. 280) we
delete m\ t&v povabiKoov on the ground that the povadiKa s. poucoTind can
never be, although (as A. subsequently shows) the dyeXdia may or may not be, ttoXitiku. But note that though anopds (H. A. ix. 25. 6i7b 21) or anopadiKus (Pol. i. 8. I256a23) is elsewhere an antithesis of dyeXcilos, it is not so here, but is only the opposite of koXitikos.


 488a IIISTORIA ANIMALIUM
others are subject to no governance : as, for instance, the
crane and the several sorts of bee submit to a ruler,
whereas ants1 and numerous other creatures2 are every
one his own master.
And again, both of gregarious and of solitary animals,
some are attached to a fixed home and others are erratic
or nomad.
15 Also, some are carnivorous, some graminivorous, some
omnivorous: whilst some feed on a peculiar diet, as for
instance the bees and the spiders, for the bee lives on
honey and certain other sweets, and the spider lives by
catching flies ; and some creatures live on fish. Again,
some creatures catch their food, others treasure it up;
20 whereas others do not so.
Some creatures provide themselves with a dwelling,
others go without one: of the former kind are the mole,
the mouse, the ant, the bee ; of the latter kind are many
insects and quadrupeds. Further, in respect to locality of
dwelling-place, some creatures dwell under ground, as the
lizard and the snake; others live on the surface of the
ground, as the horse and the dog. [Some make to
25 themselves holes, others do not so.]3
Some are nocturnal, as the owl and the bat; others live
in the daylight.
Moreover, some creatures are tame and some are wild:
some are at all times tame, as man4 and the mule; others
are at all times savage, as the leopard and the wolf; and
some creatures can be rapidly tamed, as the elephant.
Again, we may regard animals in another light. For,
30 whenever a race of animals is found domesticated, the same
is always to be found in a wild 5 6 condition ; as we find to be
the case with horses,kinc, swine, [men,] sheep, goats, and dogs.

 BOOK 1. i 488a
Further, some animals emit sound while others are mute,
and some are endowed with voice : of these latter some have
articulate speech,1 while others are inarticulate ; some are
given to continual chirping and twittering, some are prone
to silence ; some are musical, and some unmusical; but all
animals without exception exercise their power of singing 488b
or chattering chiefly in connexion with the intercourse of
the sexes.
Again, some creatures live in the fields, as the cushat;
some on the mountains, as the hoopoe; some frequent the
abodes of men, as the pigeon.
Some, again, are peculiarly salacious, as the partridge,2
the barn-door cock and fheir congeners ; others are inclined
to chastity, as the whole tribe of crows, for birds of this 5
kind indulge but rarely in sexual intercourse.3
Of marine animals, again, some live in the open seas,
some near the shore, some on rocks.4
Furthermore, some are combative under offence; others
are provident for defence. Of the former kind are such
as act as aggressors upon others or retaliate when sub¬
jected to ill usage, and of the latter kind are such as 10
merely have some means of guarding themselves against
attack.
Animals also differ from one another in regard to char¬
acter in the following respects. Some are good-tempered,
sluggish, and little prone to ferocity, as the ox; others
are quick-tempered, ferocious and unteachable, as the wild
boar; some are intelligent and timid, as the stag and the 15
hare; others are mean and treacherous, as the snake;
others are noble and courageous and high-bred, as the
lion; others are thorough-bred and wild and treacherous,
as the wolf: for, by the way, an animal is high-bred 5 if it
come from a noble stock, and an animal is thorough-bred
if it does not deflect from its racial characteristics.

20 Further, some are crafty and mischievous, as the fox;
some'are spirited1 and affectionate and fawning, as the
dog; others are easy-tempered and easily domesticated,
as the elephant; others are cautious and watchful, as the
goose ; others are jealous and self-conceited, as the peacock.
But of all animals man alone is capable of deliberation.
25 Many animals have memory,2 3 and are capable of in¬
struction ; but no other creature except man can recall the
past at will.
With regard to the several genera of animals, particulars
as to their habits of life and modes of existence will be
discussed more fully by and by.
•
3 Common to all animals are the organs whereby they
3° take food and the organs whereinto they take it;4 and
these are either identical with one another, or are
diverse in the ways above specified : to wit, either iden¬
tical in form, or varying in respect of excess or defect,
or resembling one another analogically, or differing in
position.
Furthermore, the great majority of animals have other
organs besides these in common, whereby they discharge
the residuum of their food : I say, the giveat majority, for
48ga this statement does not apply to all. And, by the way,
the organ whereby food is taken in is called the mouth,
and the organ whereinto it is taken, the belly; the re¬
mainder of the alimentary system has a great variety of
names.
Now the residuum of food is twofold in kind, wet and
dry, and such creatures as have organs receptive of wet
residuum are invariably found with organs receptive of dry
residuum ;5 but such as have organs receptive of dry resi

2 Cf. Metaphys. i. 1. 3 A. begins here to refer to fu7ictiony and to speak of organs in relation to their particular function : this subject is discussed much more fully in P.A. i. 5 and other portions of the same work. 4 P.A. ii. 10. 655b30. ’ rpo^f/y = nfiHTTWfMfiTos; cf. infra, vi. 2. 59°a 3° 1 C. A. i. 13- 7J91j 34* &c. So Bonitz, &c., but it seems simpler to take the construction as


 BOOK I. 2 489
duum need not possess organs receptive of wet residuum.
In other words, an animal has a bowel or intestine 1 if it 5
have a bladder; but an animal may have a bowel and be
without a bladder. And, by the way, I may here remark
that the organ receptive of wet residuum is termed
c bladder and the organ receptive of dry residuum
‘ intestine or bowel ’.
3 Of animals otherwise,2 a great many have, besides the
organs above-mentioned, an organ for excretion of the
sperm : and of animals capable of generation one secretes 10
into another, and the other into itself.3 The latter is
termed ‘ female ’, and the former ‘ male ’; but some animals
have neither male nor female. Consequently, the organs
connected with this function differ in form, for some
animals have a womb and others an organ analogous
thereto.
The above-mentioned organs, then, are the most indis- 15
pensable parts of animals; and with some of them all
animals without exception, and with others animals for the
most part, must needs be provided.
One sense, and one alone, is common to all animals
the sense of touch.4 Consequently, there is no special
name for the organ in which it has its seat; for in some
groups of animals the organ is identical, in others it is only
analogous.
4 Every animal is supplied with moisture, and, if the 20
animal be deprived of the same by natural causes or
artificial means, death ensues: further, every animal has
another part in which the moisture is contained. These
parts are blood and vein, and in other animals there is
ecthliptic, for Tr/p nepLTTO)cri.P rqv Trjs vypas Ka\ rr/s £rjpas TpoffirjS, as in

something to correspond ;1 but in these latter the parts are
imperfect, being merely fibre and serum or lymph.2
Touch has its seat in a part uniform and homogeneous,
as in the flesh or something of the kind,3 and generally,
25 with animals supplied with blood, in the parts charged
with blood. In other animals it has its seat in parts analo¬
gous to the parts charged with blood; but in all cases it is
seated in parts that in their texture are homogeneous.
The active faculties,4 on the contrary, are seated in the
parts that are heterogeneous: as; for instance, the business
of preparing the food is seated in the mouth, and the office
of locomotion in the feet, the wings, or in organs to
correspond.
30 Again, some animals are supplied with blood, as man,
the horse, and all such animals as are, when full-grown,
cither destitute of feet, or two-footed, or four-footed ; other
animals are bloodless, such as the bee and the wasp, and,
of marine animals, the cuttle-fish, the crawfish, and all such
animals as have more than four feet.
Again, some animals are viviparous, others oviparous, 5
others vermiparous or * grub-bearing ’. Some are vivi
48915 parous, such as man, the horse, the seal, and all other
animals that are hair-coated, and, of marine animals, the
cetaceans, as the dolphin, and the so-called Selachia. (Of
these latter animals, some have a tubular air-passage and
no gills, as the dolphin and the whale :5 the dolphin with
the air-passage going through its back,0 the whale with the

4 The main contrast is with the senses, not excluding other functions such as the supply of moisture or of air. We should probably say ‘ The more mechanical operations are performed &c. 6 Plin. ix. 7. c bui tov viotov, which, according to Schneider, ‘ spatium inter caput et dorsum significat, ut apud Herodotum . . . bia cubacarov ltcos, initio anni undecimi.’ The corresponding passages in P.

air-passage in its forehead ; others have uncovered gills, 5
as the Selachia, the sharks and rays.1)
What we term an egg is a certain completed result of
conception out of which the animal that is to be develops,
and in such a way that in respect to its primitive germ it
comes from part only of the egg, while the rest serves for
food as the germ develops.2 A ‘ grub * on the other hand is
a thing out of which in its entirety the animal in its entirety
develops, by differentiation and growth of the embryo. io
Of viviparous animals, some hatch eggs in their own
interior, as creatures of the shark kind; others engender in
their interior a live foetus, as man and the horse. When
the result of conception is perfected, with some animals
a living creature is brought forth, with others an egg is
brought to light, with others a grub. Of the eggs, some have
egg-shells and are of two different colours within, such as
birds’ eggs ; others are soft-skinned and of uniform colour, as 15
the eggs of animals of the shark kind. Of the grubs, some
are from the first capable of movement,others are motionless.3
However, with regard to these phenomena we shall speak
precisely hereafter when we come to treat of Generation.
Furthermore, some animals have feet and some are
destitute thereof.4 Of such as have feet, some animals have 20
two, as is the case with men and birds, and with men and
birds only; some have four, as the lizard and the dog ;
some have more, as the centipede and the bee ; but allsoever
that have feet have an even number of them.
Of swimming creatures that are destitute of feet, some
have winglets or fins, as fishes : and of these some have
four fins, two above on the back, two below on the belly,5 25

as the gilt-head and the basse;1 some have two only.—to
wit, such as are exceedingly long and smooth, as the eel
and the conger ; some have none at all, as the muraena,
but use the sea just as snakes use dry ground—and by the
way, snakes swim in water in just the same way.2 Of the
30 shark-kind some have no fins, such as those that are flat
and long-tailed, as the ray and the sting-ray, but these
fishes swim actually by the undulatory motion of their flat
bodies ; the fishing frog, however, has fins, and so likewise
have all such fishes as have not their flat surfaces thinned
off to a sharp edge."
Of those swimming creatures that appear to have feet,
as is the case with the molluscs, these creatures swim by
the aid of their feet and their fins as well, and they swim
most rapidly backwards in the direction of the trunk,4 as is
the case with the cuttle-fish or sepia and the calamary;
and, by the way, neither of these latter can walk as the
49°a poulpe or octopus can.
The hard-skinned or crustaceous animals, like the craw¬
fish, swim by the instrumentality of their tail-parts; and
they swim most rapidly tail foremost, by the aid of the fins
developed upon that member. The newt swims by means
of its feet and tail ; and its tail resembles that of the sheat
5 fish, to compare little with great.
Of animals that can fly some are furnished with feathered
wings, as the eagle and the hawk; some are furnished with
membranous wings,6 as the bee and the cockchafer; others
are furnished with leathern wings,as the flying fox6 and the
bat. All flying creatures possessed of blood have feathered
wings or leathern wings; the bloodless creatures have
membranous wings, as insects. The creatures that have
10 feathered wings or leathern wings have either two feet"

or no feet at all: for there are said to be certain flying
serpents in Ethiopia 1 that are destitute of feet.
Creatures that have feathered wings are classed as a
genus under the name of ‘ bird ’; the other two genera, the
leathern-winged and membrane-winged, are as yet without
a generic title.
Of creatures that can fly and are bloodless some are
coleopterous or sheath-winged, for they have their wings
in a sheath or shard, like the cockchafer and the dung- 15
beetle; others are sheathless, and of these latter some are
dipterous and some tetrapterous: tetrapterous, such as are
comparatively large or have their stings in the tail, dipterous,
such as are comparatively small or have their stings in
front. The coleoptera are, without exception, devoid of
stings; the diptera have the sting in front, as the fly, the 20
horsefly, the gadfly, and the gnat.2
Bloodless animals as a general rule are inferior in point
of size to blooded animals ; though, by the way, there are
found in the sea some few bloodless creatures of abnormal
size, as in the case of certain molluscs.3 And of these
bloodless genera, those are the largest that dwell in milder
climates, and those that inhabit the sea are larger than 25
those living on dry land or in fresh water.
All creatures that are capable of motion move with four
or more points of motion ;4 the blooded animals with four
only: as, for instance, man with two hands and two feet,
birds with two wings and two feet, quadrupeds and fishes
severally with four feet and four fins. Creatures that have 30
two winglets or fins, or that have none at all like serpents,
move all the same with not less than four points of motion;
for there are four bends in their bodies as they move, or
two bends together with their fins. Bloodless and many¬
footed animals, whether furnished with wings or feet, move
with more than four points of motion ; as, for instance, the
day fly moves with four feet and four wings:5 and, I may 490b
observe in passing, this creature is exceptional not only

in regard to the duration of its existence, whence it re¬
ceives its name, but also because though a quadruped it
has wings also.
All animals move alike, four-footed and many-footed ;
5 in other words, they all move cross-corner-wise. And
animals in general have two feet in advance; the crab
alone has four.1
Very extensive genera of animals,2^into which other 6
subdivisions fall, are the following: one, of birds; one, of
fishes ; and another, of cetaceans. Now all these creatures
are blooded.
There is another genus of the hard-shell kind, which is
io called oyster;3 another of the soft-shell kind, not as
yet designated by a.single term! such as the spiny crawfish
and the various kinds of crabs and lobsters ; and another of
molluscs, as the two kinds of calamary and the cuttle-fish ;
that of insects is different. All these latter creatures are
bloodless, and such of them as have feet have a goodly
i5 number of them ; and of the insects some have wings as
well as feet.
Of the other animals the genera are not extensive.4 For
in them one species does not comprehend many species;5
1 A. seems to take the crab as walking strictly sideways : cf. de I?ic. 17. 7i3b32. . f 2 The object of this chapter, as Scaliger clearly points out, is not to define genera, but, where possible, to denominate them : to show how certain familiar terms correspond to real generic groups, while on the other hand for many groups or genera susceptible of definition language has no names to correspond. The modern naturalist devises a new name for each new group that he defines ; for Aristotle the definition was enough. 3 oarpaov speciem fecit A., oarpeov genus: Seal, in loc. 4 The whole passage is very troublesome, and A. seems to juggle with the terms (tSo? and yevos. This is not in itself unusual, for a group may of course be an udos in respect to a larger y«Voy, and at the same time a yevos in respect to smaller d'Sq. A. seems to me to be trying to show: (1) that the other large genera comparable to bird, fish, &c., are not generally recognized, and are difficult to define; though (2) he does succeed in arriving at, e. g., the genus of viviparous quadrupeds (490^ 31); (3) that sometimes a genus has many species, but under no common appellation; for, while this crab and that crab form the yevos to tSsv Kapnivaw, itself within the ytuos to tuv pu\uKo(jTpuKw, yet there is no such comprehensive name for any group of species within the y*vos to tuv TtrpanuSku\ ((ootukuv, save perhaps
for the \o<povpoi. 5 7T€pif\a 7roWa (18t) tv eiSor. This seems to be a technical phrase,


 BOOK I. 6 49°b
but in one case, as man, the species is simple, admitting of
no differentiation, while other cases admit of differentiation,
but the forms lack particular designations.
So, for instance, creatures that are quadrupedal and
unprovided with wings are blooded without exception,1 but 20
some of them are viviparous, and some oviparous. Such
as are viviparous are hair-coated, and such as are oviparous
are covered with a kind of tessellated hard substance; and
the tessellated bits of this substance are, as it were, similar
in regard to position to a scale.2
An animal that is blooded and capable of movement on
dry land, but is naturally unprovided with feet, belongs to
the serpent genus ; and animals of this genus are coated
with the tessellated horny substance. Serpents in general
are oviparous; the adder, an exceptional case, is viviparous:3 25
for not all viviparous animals are hair-coated, and some
fishes also are viviparous.
All animals, however, that are hair-coated are viviparous.
For, by the way, one must regard as a kind of hair such
prickly hairs as hedgehogs and porcupines carry ; for these
spines perform the office of hair, and not of feet as is the 30
case with similar parts in sea-urchins.4
In the genus that combines all viviparous quadrupeds
are many species, but under no common appellation. They
are only named as it were one by one, as we say man,
lion, stag, horse, dog, and so on ; though, by the way, there
is a sort of genus5 that embraces all creatures that have
bushy manes and bushy tails,0 such as the horse, the ass, 4gia
the mule, the jennet, and the animals that are called

Hemioni 1 in Syria,—from their externally resembling
mules, though they are not strictly of the same species.
And that they are not so is proved by the fact that they
mate with and breed from one another.
5 For all these reasons, we must take animals species by
species, and discuss their peculiarities severally.
These preceding statements, then, have been put forward
thus in a general way, as a kind of foretaste of the number
of subjects and of the properties that we have to consider
in order that we may first get a clear notion of distinctive
character and common properties. By and by we shall
discuss these matters with greater minuteness,
io After this we shall pass on to the discussion of causes.
For to do this when the investigation of the details is
complete is the proper and natural method, and that
whereby the subjects and the premisses of our argument
will afterwards be rendered plain.
In the first place we must look to the constituent parts
i5 of animals.2 For it is in a way relative to these parts, first
and foremost, that animals in their entirety differ from one
another: either in the fact that some have this or that,
while they have not that or this ; or by peculiarities of
position or of arrangement; or by the differences that
have been previously mentioned, depending upon diversity
of form, on excess or defect in this or that particular, on
analogy, or on contrasts of the accidental qualities.
To begin with, we must take into consideration the
20 parts of Man. For, just as each nation is wont to
reckon by that monetary standard with which it is most
familiar, so must we do in other matters. And, of course,
man is the animal with which we are all of us the most
familiar.
Now the parts are obvious enough to physical perception.
However, with the view of observing due order and sequence
and of combining rational notions with physical perception,

we shall proceed to enumerate the parts: firstly, the organic,1 25
and afterwards the simple or non-composite.
7 The chief parts into which the body as a whole is sub¬
divided,2 are the head, the neck, the trunk (extending from
the neck to the privy parts), which is called the thorax, two
arms and two legs.3
Of the parts of which the head is composed the hair- 3°
covered portion is called the * skull \ The front portion of
it is termed ‘ bregma ’ or ‘ sinciput ’, developed after birth
for it is the last of all the bones in the body to acquire
solidity,4—the hinder part is termed the ‘ occiput’, and the
part intervening between the sinciput and the occiput is
the ‘ crown The brain lies underneath the sinciput ; the
occiput is hollow.5 6 The skull consists entirely of thin 0 491
bone, rounded in shape, and contained within a wrapper
of fleshless skin.
The skull has sutures : one, of circular form, in the case
of women ; in the case of men, as a general rule, three
meeting at a point.7 Instances have been known of a
man’s skull devoid of suture altogether. In the skull the 5

middle line, where the hair parts,1 is called the crown or
vertex. In some cases the parting is double ; that is to
say, some men are double-crowned, not in regard to the
bony skull, but in consequence of the double fall or set
of the hair.2
The part that lies under the skull is called the ‘ face ’: 8
10 but in the case of man only, for the term is not applied to
a fish or to an ox. In the face the part below the sinci¬
put and between the eyes is termed the forehead. When
men have large foreheads, they are slow to move; when
they have small ones, they are fickle; when they have
broad ones, they are apt to be distraught; when they
have foreheads rounded or bulging out, they are quick¬
tempered.3 4 * 6
Underneath the forehead are two eyebrows. Straight 9
15eyebrows are a sign of softness of disposition; such as
curve in towards the nose, of harshness; such as curve out
towards the temples, of humour and dissimulation ; such as
are drawn in towards one another, of jealousy.1
Under the eyebrows come the eyes. These are naturally
two in number. Each of them has an upper and a lower
eyelid, and the hairs on the edges of these are termed
20 ‘ eyelashes ’. The central part of the eye includes the
moist part whereby vision is effected, termed the 1 pupil '
and the part surrounding it called the ‘black’; the part
outside this is the ‘ white ’. A part common to the upper
and lower eyelid is a pair of nicks or corners, one in
the direction of the nose, and the other in the direction of

the temples. When these are long they are a sign of bad
disposition ; if the side toward the nostril be fleshy and 25
comb-like,1 they are a sign of dishonesty.
All animals, as a general rule, are provided with eyes,
excepting the ostracoderms and other imperfect creatures ;
at all events, all viviparous animals have eyes, with the
exception of the mole. And yet one might assert that,
though the mole has not eyes in the full sense, yet it has
eyes in a kind of a way. For in point of absolute fact it
cannot see, and has no eyes visible externally ; but when 30
the outer skin is removed, it is found to have the place
where eyes are usually situated, and the black parts of the
eyes rightly situated, and all the place that is usually
devoted on the outside to eyes : showing that the parts are
stunted in development, and the skin allowed to grow
over.2
10 Of the eye 3 the white is pretty much the same in a!1492
creatures; but what is called the black differs in various
animals.1 Some have the rim black, some distinctly blue,
some greyish-blue, some greenish ;5 and this last colour is
the sign of an excellent disposition, and is particularly well
adapted for sharpness of vision.
1 By the Kpebdes is plainly meant the carunculci at the inner angle of the eye, which represents the third eyelid or nictitating membrane of the bird, especially well seen in hawks, owls, and many other large birds (P.A. ii. 13. 657b 16). It is very tempting to read olov Urlves, for olov KTevfy, with the Cod. Canis., Alb. Magnus (who renders sicut accidit oculis milvi) and Piccolos, and also with the version of De Moerbeke according to a MS. quoted by Camus (Notit. vi. p. 440 ; Schn. iii. p. 30).

 HISTORIA ANIMALIUM
Man is the only, or nearly the only, creature, that has
eyes of diverse colours. Animals, as a rule, have eyes of
one colour only. Some horses have blue eyes.1
Of eyes, some are large, some small, some medium-sized ;
of these, the medium-sized are the best. Moreover, eyes
sometimes protrude, sometimes recede, sometimes are neither
protruding nor receding. Of these, the receding eye is in
all animals the most acute ; but the last kind are the sign
of the best disposition.2 Again, eyes are sometimes inclined
to wink under observation, sometimes to remain open and
staring, and sometimes are disposed neither to wink nor
stare. The last kind are the sign of the best nature, and
of the others, the latter kind indicates impudence, and the
former indecision.
Furthermore, there is a portion of the head, whereby an II
animal hears, a part incapable of breathing, the ‘ ear ’.
I say ‘incapable of breathing’, for Alcmaeon is mistaken
when he says that goats inspire through their ears.3 Of
5 the ear one part is unnamed, the other part is called the
‘ lobe ’;4 and it is entirely composed of gristle and flesh.
The ear is constructed internally like the trumpet-shell, and
the innermost bone is like the ear itself,5 and into it at the
end the sound makes its way, as into the bottom of a jar.
This receptacle does not communicate by any passage with
o the brain, but does so with the palate, and a vein extends
from the brain towards it. The eyes also are connected
with the brain, and each of them lies at the end of a little
vein. Of animals possessed of ears man is the only one
that cannot move this organ. Of creatures possessed of
hearing, some have ears, whilst others have none, but merely
214 (i. p. 267 K. v. p. 322 L), means a speck in the eye. Cf. G.A. v.

have the passages for ears visible, as, for example, feathered 25
animals or animals coated with horny tessellates.
Viviparous animals, with the exception of the seal, the
dolphin, and those others which after a similar fashion to
these are cetaceans,1 are all provided with ears; for, by the
way, the shark-kind are also viviparous. Now, the seal has
the passages visible whereby it hears;2 but the dolphin
can hear, but has no ears, nor yet any passages visible.3 3°
But man alone is unable to move his ears, and all other
animals can move them.4 And the ears lie, with man, in
the same horizontal plane with the eyes, and not in a plane
above them as is the case with some quadrupeds.5 Of ears,
some are fine, some are coarse, and some are of medium
texture ; the last kind are best for hearing, but they serve
in no way to indicate character. Some ears are large, some
small, some medium-sized ; again, some stand out far, some
lie in close and tight, and some take up a medium position ; 492
of these such as are of medium size and of medium posi¬
tion are indications of the best disposition, while the large
and outstanding6 ones indicate a tendency to irrelevant
talk or chattering. The part intercepted between the eye,
the ear, and the crown is termed the ‘ temple’.
Again, there is a part of the countenance that serves as 5
a passage for the breath, the ‘nose’. For a man inhales
and exhales by this organ, and sneezing is effected by its
means : which last is an outward rush of collected breath,
and is the only mode of breath used as an omen and re¬
garded as supernatural.7 Both inhalation and exhalation
go right on from the nose towards the chest ;8 and with the

io nostrils alone and separately it is impossible to inhale or
exhale, owing to the fact that the inspiration and respiration
take place from the chest along the windpipe, and not by
any portion connected with the head; and indeed it is
possible for a creature to live without using1 this process of
nasal respiration.
Again, smelling takes place by means of the nose,2
—smelling, or the sensible discrimination of odour. And the
nostril admits of easy motion, and is not, like the ear, intrin
15 sically immovable. A part of it, composed of gristle, con¬
stitutes a septum or partition, and part is an open passage ;
for the nostril consists of two separate channels. The
nostril (or nose) of the elephant3 is long and strong, and
the animal uses it like a hand ; for by means of this organ
it draws objects towards it, and takes hold of them, and
20 introduces its food into its mouth, whether liquid or dry
food, and it is the only living creature that does so.
Furthermore, there are two jaws ; the front part of them
constitutes the chin, and the hinder part the cheek. All
animals move the lower jaw, with the exception of the river
crocodile ; this creature moves the upper jaw only.4
35 Next after the nose come two lips, composed of flesh,
and facile of motion. The mouth lies inside the jaws and
lips. Parts of the mouth are the roof or palate and the
pharynx.
The part that is sensible of taste is the tongue. The
sensation has its seat at the tip of the tongue ; if the object
to be tasted 5 be placed on the flat surface of the organ,
the taste is less sensibly experienced. The tongue is
sensitive in all other ways wherein flesh in general is so:
30 that is, it can appreciate hardness, or warmth and cold, in
any part of it, just as it can appreciate taste.0 The tongue
is sometimes broad, sometimes narrow, and sometimes of

medium width ; the last kind is the best and the clearest
in its discrimination of taste.1 Moreover, the tongue is
sometimes loosely hung, and sometimes fastened:2 as in
the case of those who mumble and who lisp.3
The tongue consists of flesh, soft and spongy, and the
so-called £ epiglottis ’ is a part of this organ.
That part of the mouth that splits into two bits is
called the ‘ tonsils ’ ; that part that splits into many bits, 493
the ‘ gums Both the tonsils and the gums are composed
of flesh. In the gums are teeth, composed of bone.
Inside the mouth is another part, shaped like a bunch of
grapes,4 a pillar streaked with veins.5 * If this pillar gets
relaxed G and inflamed it is called £ uvula ’ or ‘ bunch of
grapes and it then has a tendency to bring about suffoca¬
tion.7
12 The neck 8 is the part between the face and the trunk. Of 5
this the front part is the larynx [and the back part the
gullet].9 The front part, composed of gristle, through
which respiration and speech is effected, is termed the
‘wind-pipe’; the part that is fleshy is the oesophagus, inside
just in front of the chine. The part to the back of the
neck is the epomis, or ‘ shoulder-point \10

io These then are the parts to be met with before you come
to the thorax.
To the trunk there is a front part and a back part. Next
after the neck in the front part is the chest, with a pair of
breasts. To each of the breasts is attached a teat or
nipple, through which in the case of females the milk per¬
colates ; and the breast is of a spongy texture. Milk, by
the way, is found at times in the male; but with the male
15 the flesh of the breast is tough, with the female it is soft
and porous.
Next after the thorax and in front comes the 5 belly’, and
its root1 the ‘navel’. Underneath this root the bilateral
part is the ‘flank’: the undivided2 part below the
navel, the ‘ abdomen the extremity of which is the region
20 of the ‘ pubes ’; and above the navel the ‘ hypochondrium ’ ;
the cavity common to the hypochondrium and the flank
is the gut-cavity.
Serving as a brace-girdle to the hinder parts is the
pelvis, and hence it gets its name (ocr(pv$), for it is sym¬
metrical (Icro^ves) in appearance ; of the fundament the part
for resting on is termed the ‘ rump and the part whereon
the thigh pivots is termed the ‘ socket ’ (or acetabulum).
The ‘ womb ’ is a part peculiar to the female; and the
‘ penis ’ is peculiar to the male. This latter organ is ex¬
ternal and situated at the extremity of the trunk ; it is
composed of two separate parts: of which the extreme
part is fleshy, does not alter in size,3 and is called the
glans ; and round about it is a skin devoid of any specific
title,4 5 which integument if it be cut asunder never grows
together again, any more than docs the jaw or the eyelid.
And the connexion between the latter and the glans is

called the frenum. The remaining part of the penis is 30
composed of gristle ; it is easily susceptible of enlargement;
and it protrudes and recedes in the reverse directions to
what is observable in the identical organ in cats.1 Under¬
neath the penis are two ‘ testicles and the integument of
these is a skin that is termed the ‘ scrotum’.
Testicles are not identical with flesh, and are not alto¬
gether diverse from it. But by and by we shall treat in an 493
exhaustive way regarding all such parts.
4 The privy part of the female is in character opposite to
that of the male. In other words, the part under the pubes
is hollow or receding, and not, like the male organ, pro¬
truding. Further, there is an 4 urethra ’ outside the womb ;
(which organ serves as a passage for the sperm of the male, 5
and as an outlet for liquid excretion to both sexes).2 * *
The part common to the neck and chest is the ‘throat’;
the ‘armpit’ is common to side, arm, and shoulder; and the
‘groin ’ is common to thigh and abdomen. The part inside
the thigh and buttocks is the ‘ perineum and the part
outside the thigh and buttocks is the ‘ hypoglutis ’. 10
The front parts of the trunk have now been enumerated.
The part behind the chest is termed the ‘ back ’.
5 Parts of the back are a pair of ‘shoulder-blades’, the
‘back-bone’, and, underneath on a level with the belly in
the trunk,3 the ‘ loins ’. Common to the upper and lower
part of the trunk are the ‘ ribs ’, eight on either side, for as
to the so-called seven-ribbed Ligyans we have not received >5
any trustworthy evidence.
Man, then, has an upper and a lower part, a front and
a back part, a right and a left side. Now the right and the
left side are pretty well alike in their parts and identical

20 throughout, except that the left side is the weaker of the
two; but the back parts do not resemble the front ones,
neither do the lower ones the upper: only that these upper
and lower parts may be said to resemble one another thus
far, that, if the face be plump or meagre, the abdomen is
plump or meagre to correspond; and that the legs correspond
to the arms, and where the upper arm is short the thigh is
25 usually short also, and where the feet are small the hands
are small correspondingly.
Of the limbs, one set, forming a pair, is ‘ arms’. To the
arm belong the ‘shoulder’, ‘upper-arm’, ‘elbow’, ‘fore¬
arm’, and ‘hand’. To the hand belong the ‘palm’, and
the five ‘ fingers \ The part of the finger that bends is
termed ‘ knuckle ’, the part that is inflexible is termed the
‘ phalanx The big finger or thumb is single-jointed, the
30 other fingers are double-jointed. The bending both of the
arm and of the finger takes place from without inwards in
all cases ; and the arm bends at the elbow. The inner part
of the hand is termed the ‘palm ’, and is fleshy and divided
by joints or lines: in the case of long-lived people by one
494a or two extending right across, in the case of the short-lived
by two, not so extending.1 The joint between hand and
arm is termed the ‘ wrist \ The outside or back of the
hand is sinewy, and has no specific designation.
There is another duplicate limb, the ‘ leg ’. Of this limb
the double-knobbed part is termed the ‘thigh-bone’, the
5 sliding part the ‘ knee-cap’, the double-boned part the ‘ leg’;
the front part of this latter is termed the ‘shin’, and the
part behind it the ‘ calf ’, wherein the flesh is sinewy and
venous, in some cases drawn upwards towards the hollow
behind the knee, as in the case of people with large hips, and
in other cases drawn downwards. The lower extremity of
10 the shin is the ‘ ankle ’, duplicate in either leg. The part
of the limb that contains a multiplicity of bones is the
‘ footThe hinder part of the foot is the ‘ heel'; at the
front of it the divided part consists of‘toes’, five in num¬
ber; the fleshy part underneath is the ‘ball' ;2 the upper

 BOOK I. 15 494a
part or back of the foot is sinewy and has no particular
appellation ; of the toe, one portion is the ‘nail’ and another
the ‘joint’, and the nail is in all cases at the extremity; 15
and toes are without exception single-jointed. Men that
have the inside or sole of the foot clumsy and not arched,
that is, that walk resting on the entire under-surface of
their feet,1 2 are prone to roguery. The joint common to
thigh and shin is the ‘ knee ’.
These, then, are the parts common to the male and
the female sex. The relative position of the parts as to
up and down, or to front and back, or to right and left, all 20
this as regards externals might safely be left to mere
ordinary perception. But for all that, we must treat of
them for the same reason as the one previously brought
forward ; that is to say, we must refer to them in order
that a due and regular sequence may be observed in our
exposition, and in order that by the enumeration of these
obvious facts due attention may be subsequently given to 25
those parts in men and other animals that are diverse in
any way from one another.
In man, above all other animals, the terms ‘ upper ’ and
‘ lower’ are used in harmony with their natural positions ;
for in him, upper and lower have the same meaning as
when they are applied to the universe as a whole.- In like
manner the terms, ‘in front’, ‘behind’, ‘right’ and ‘left’, are 30
used in accordance with their natural sense. But in regard
to other animals, in some cases these distinctions do not
exist, and in others they do so, but in a vague way. For
instance, the head with all animals is up and above in
respect to their bodies ; but man alone, as has been said,
has, in maturity, this part uppermost in respect to the 494b
material universe.
Next after the head comes the neck, and then the chest
and the back: the one in front and the other behind.
Next after these come the belly, the loins, the sexual parts,
land the haunches ; then the thigh and shin; and, lastly,
the feet.

 IIISTORIA ANIMALIUM
The legs bend frontwards, in the direction of actual
progression, and frontwards also lies that part of the foot
5 which is the most effective of motion, and the flexure of
that part ; but the heel lies at the back, and the ankle
bones lie laterally, earwise.1 The arms are situated to
right and left, and bend inwards: so that the convexities
io formed by bent arms and legs are practically face to face
with one another in the case of man.2
As for the senses and for the organs of sensation, the
eyes, the nostrils, and the tongue, all alike are situated
frontwards ; the sense of hearing, and the organ of hearing,
the ear, is situated sideways, on the same horizontal plane
15 with the eyes. The eyes in man are, in proportion to his
size, nearer to one another than in any other animal.
Of the senses man has the sense of touch more refined
than any animal, and so also, but in less degree, the sense
of taste ; in the development of the other senses he is
surpassed by a great number of animals.
The parts, then, that are externally visible are arranged iG
20 in the way above stated, and as a rule have their special
designations, and from use and wont are known familiarly
to all; but this is not the case with the inner parts. For
the fact is that the inner parts of man are to a very
great extent unknown, and the consequence is that we
must have recourse to an examination of the inner parts of
other animals whose nature in any way resembles that
of man.
25 In the first place then, the brain lies in the front part of
the head.3 * 5 And this holds alike with all animals possessed
of a brain ; and all blooded animals are possessed thereof,
1 Here A. and \V. suggest funrepov (KarepioSev for (Kuripov koto to ovs, and translate ‘ jeder der beiden Knochel an den beiden Seiten des Fusses ’. The passage is perhaps corrupt, but it would seem that the general reference is to direction of flexure and not to position of parts ; this, together with the manifestly awkward position of *ni ?; Ku/z^tr in the preceding line, suggests some such reading as the following, kcu fj Kap.\f/is y) ptv TTTtpvrjs (k tov onio’Sd', to>i' fie <T<f)vp(ov tKaripuiOtv Karii to out (cf. 1. 14 infra). 7 //.A. ii. i. 4981 3; de Inc. 12-14. 7iia-7i2b. 5 Hippocr. dc Mori), ii. 8 (ii. p. 219 K; vii. p. 16 L).


 BOOK I. 16 494b
and, by the way, molluscs as well. But, taking size for
size of animal, the largest brain,1 and the moistest, is that
of man. Two membranes enclose it: the stronger one2 3
nearer the bone of the skull; the inner one,:i round the 30
brain itself, is finer. The brain in all cases is bilateral.4
Behind this, right at the back, comes what is termed the
‘ cerebellum ’, differing in form from the brain as we may
both feel and see.
The back of the head is with all animals empty and
hollow, whatever be its size in the different animals.5 For 495*
some creatures have big heads while the face below is small
in proportion, as is the case with round-faced animals ; some
have little heads and long jaws, as is the case, without
exception, among animals of the mane-and-tail species.
The brain in all animals is bloodless,6 devoid of veins, 5
and naturally cold to the touch;7 in the great majority
of animals it has a small hollow in its centre. The
brain-caul around it is reticulated with veins; and this
brain-caul is that skin-like membrane which closely sur¬
rounds the brain. Above the brain is the thinnest and
weakest bone of the head, which is termed ‘bregma’ or 10
‘ sinciput \8
From the eye there go three ducts to the brain: the
largest and the medium-sized to the cerebellum, the least
to the brain itself; and the least is the one situated nearest
to the nostril. The two largest ones, then, run side by
side and do not meet; the medium-sized ones meet—and 15
this is particularly visible in fishes,—for they lie nearer
than the large ones to the brain ; the smallest pair are the
most widely separate from one another, and do not meet.
Inside the neck is what is termed the ‘ oesophagus3
1 P. A. ii. 14. 658^ 7. 2 The dura mater; cf. Hippocr. de loc. in Horn. 2 (vi. p. 2S0 L); H. A. iii. 13. 51911. 3 The pia mater, the prjviy£ or ‘ brain-caul’ of the sequel. 4 Hippocr. de Morb.

20 (whose other name 1 is derived from its length and narrow¬
ness), and the windpipe. The windpipe is situated in
front of the oesophagus in all animals that have a wind¬
pipe, and all animals have one that are furnished with
lungs. The windpipe is made up of gristle, is sparingly
supplied with blood, and is streaked all round with numerous
25 minute veins; it is situated, in its upper part, near the
mouth, below the aperture formed by the nostrils into the
mouth—an aperture through which, when men, in drinking,
inhale any of the liquid, this liquid finds its way out
through the nostrils. In betwixt the two openings comes
the so-called epiglottis,2 an organ capable of being drawn
over and covering the orifice of the windpipe communi
30 eating with the mouth ; the end of the tongue is attached
to the epiglottis. In the other direction the windpipe
extends to the interval between the lungs, and hereupon
bifurcates into each of the two divisions of the lung; for
the lung in all animals possessed of the organ has a ten¬
dency to be double. In viviparous animals, however, the
495b duplication is not so plainly discernible as in other species,
and the duplication is least discernible in man. And in man
the organ is not split into many parts, as is the case with
some vivipara, neither is it smooth, but its surface is uneven.
In the case of the ovipara, such as birds and oviparous
quadrupeds, the two parts of the organ are separated to
a distance from one another, so that the creatures appear
5 to be furnished with a pair of lungs; and from the windpipe,
itself single, there branch off two separate parts extending to
each of the two divisions of the lung. It is attached also
to the great vein and to what is designated the ‘ aorta
When the windpipe is charged with air, the air passes on
to the hollow parts of the lung. These parts have divisions,
10 composed of gristle, which meet at an acute angle;
from the divisions run passages through the entire lung,
giving off smaller and smaller ramifications. The heart
also is attached to the windpipe, by connexions of fat,

gristle, and sinew ; and at the point of juncture there is
a hollow. When the windpipe is charged with air, the
entrance of the air into the heart, though imperceptible in
some animals, is perceptible enough in the larger ones. 15
Such are the properties of the windpipe, and it takes in
and throws out air only, and takes in nothing else either
dry or liquid, or else it causes you pain until you shall
have coughed up whatever may have gone down.
The oesophagus communicates at the top with the
mouth, close to the windpipe, and is attached to the back- 20
bone and the windpipe by membranous ligaments, and at
last finds its way through the midriff into the belly. It is
composed of flesh-like substance, and is elastic both length¬
ways and breadthways.
The stomach of man resembles that of a dog; for it is
not much bigger than the bowel, but is somewhat like 25
a bowel of more than usual width ; then comes the bowel,
single, convoluted, moderately wide. The lower part of
the gut is like that of a pig ; for it is broad, and the part
from it to the buttocks is thick and short. The caul,1 or
great omentum, is attached to the middle of the stomach,
and consists of a fatty membrane, as is the case with all 30
other animals whose stomachs are single and which have
teeth2 in both jaws.
The mesentery is over the bowels; this also is mem¬
branous and broad, and turns to fat. It is attached to the
great vein and the aorta, and there run through it a number
of veins closely packed together, extending towards the 49^a
region of the bowels, beginning above and ending below.
So much for the properties of the oesophagus, the wind¬
pipe, and the stomach.
7 The heart3 has three cavities, and is situated above the
lung at the division of the windpipe, and is provided with 5
a fatty and thick membrane where it fastens on to the
great vein and the aorta. It lies with its tapering portion

upon the aorta, and this portion is similarly situated 1 in
relation to the chest in all animals that have a chest. In
all animals alike, in those that have a chest and in those
10 that have none, the apex of the heart points forwards,
although this fact might possibly escape notice by a change
of position under dissection. The rounded end of the heart
is at the top. The apex is to a great extent fleshy and
close in texture, and in the cavities of the heart are sinews.
As a rule the heart is situated in the middle of the chest in
15 animals that have a chest, and. in man it is situated a little
to the left-hand side, leaning a little way from the division
of the breasts towards the left breast in the upper part of
the chest.2
The heart is not large, and in its general shape it is not
elongated; in fact, it is somewhat round in form : only, be
it remembered, it is sharp-pointed at the bottom. It has
20 three cavities, as has been said: the right-hand one the
largest of the three, the left-hand one the least, and the
middle one intermediate in size.3 All these cavities, even
the two small ones, are connected by passages with the
lung,4 and this fact is rendered quite plain in one of the
25 cavities. And below, at the point of attachment, in
the largest cavity there is a connexion with the great vein 5
[near which the mesentery lies] ;6 and in the middle one
there is a connexion with the aorta.
Canals lead from the heart into the lung,7 and branch off
just as the windpipe does, running all over the lung parallel
30 with the passages from the windpipe. The canals from the
heart are uppermost; and there is no common passage, but
the passages through their having a common wall receive

the breath and pass it on to the heart; and one of the pas¬
sages conveys it to the right cavity, and the other to the left.
With regard to the great vein and the aorta we shall, by
and by, treat of them together in a discussion devoted to
them and to them alone.
In all animals that are furnished with a lung, and 496b
that are both internally and externally viviparous,1 the
lung is of all organs the most richly supplied with
blood; for the lung is throughout spongy in texture, and
along by every single pore in it go branches from the
great vein. Those who imagine it to be empty are alto- 5
gether mistaken ; and they are led into their error by their
observation of lungs removed from animals under dissection,
out of which organs the blood has all escaped immediately
after death.
Of the other internal organs the heart alone contains
blood. And the lung has blood not in itself but in its
veins, but the heart has blood in itself; for in each of its
three cavities it has blood, but the thinnest blood is what 10
it has in its central cavity.
Under the lung comes the thoracic diaphragm 2 or midriff,
attached to the ribs, the hypochondria and the backbone,
with a thin membrane in the middle of it. It has veins
running through it; and the diaphragm3 in the case of 15
man is thicker in proportion to the size of his frame than
in other animals.
Under the diaphragm on the right-hand side lies the
‘ liver ’, and on the left-hand side the {spleen ’, alike in all
animals that are provided with these organs in an ordinary
and not preternatural way; for, be it observed, in some
quadrupeds these organs have been found in a transposed
position.4 These organs are connected with the stomach 20
by the caul.
To outward view the spleen of man is narrow and long,
resembling the self-same organ in the pig. The liver in

the great majority of animals is not provided with a ‘gall¬
bladder ’; but the latter is present in some.1 The liver of a
man is round-shaped, and resembles the same organ in the
ox. And, by the way, the absence above referred to of a
25 gall-bladder is at times met with in the practice of augury.
For instance, in a certain district of the Chalcidic settlement
in Euboea the sheep are devoid of gall-bladders; and in
Naxos nearly all the quadrupeds have one so large that
foreigners when they offer sacrifice with such victims are
bewildered with fright, under the impression that the
phenomenon is not due to natural causes, but bodes some
mischief to the individual offerers of the sacrifice.2
30 Again, the liver is attached to the great vein, but it has
no communication with the aorta; for the vein that goes
off from the great vein goes right through the liver, at
a point where are the so-called ‘ portals * of the liver. The
spleen also is connected only with the great vein, for a
vein extends to the spleen off from it.
After these organs come the ‘ kidneys ’, and these are
placed close to the backbone, and resemble in character
497a the same organ in kine. In all animals that are provided
with this organ, the right kidney is situated higher up than
the other. It has also less fatty substance than the left
hand one and is less moist. And this phenomenon also
is observable in all the other animals alike.
Furthermore, passages or ducts lead into the kidneys
5 both from the great vein and from the aorta, only not into
the cavity. For, by the way, there is a cavity in the
middle of the kidney, bigger in some creatures and less in
others; but there is none in the case of the seal.4 This latter
animal has kidneys resembling in shape the identical organ
in kine, but in its case the organs are more solid than in
any other known creature. The ducts that lead into the
kidneys lose themselves in the substance of the kidneys
10 themselves ; and the proof that they extend no farther
1 The statement here would seem to be the opposite of the truth ; cf. P. A. iv. 2. 676^ 16 (\d Ka\ \o\r)v ra 7roAXa tu>v (’vaifuov (uxov. Dittm. transposes the ovk. 2 P.A. iv. 2. 677a 1. 3 1\ A. iii. 9. 671 28, 67211 23. * P. A. iii. 9. 67ib 3.

lests on the fact that they1 contain no blood, nor is any
clot found therein. The kidneys, however, have, as has
been said, a small cavity. From this cavity in the kidney
theie lead two considerable ducts or ureters into the bladder;
and others spring from the aorta, strong and continuous.2
And to the middle of each of the two kidneys is attached
a hollow sinewy vein, stretching right along the spine 15
through the narrows; by and by these veins are lost in
either loin, and again become visible extending to the
flank. And these off-branchings of the veins terminate in
the bladder. For the bladder lies at the extremity, and is
held in position by the ducts stretching from the kidneys,
along the stalk that extends to the urethra; and pretty 20
well all round it is fastened by fine sinewy membranes,
that resemble to some extent the thoracic diaphragm. The
bladder in man is, proportionately to his size, tolerably large.
To the stalk of the bladder the private part is attached,
the external orifices coalescing;3 but a little lower down, 25
one of the openings communicates with the testicles and
the otnei with the bladder. The penis is gristly and
sinewy in its texture. With it are connected the testicles
in male animals, and the properties of these organs we
shall discuss in our general account of the said organ.4
All these organs are similar in the female; for there is 30
no diffeience in regard to the internal organs, except in
respect to the womb, and with reference to the appearance
of tnis organ I must refer the reader to diagrams in my
‘ Anatomy The womb, however, is situated over the
bowel, and the bladder lies over the womb. But we must
treat by and by in our pages of the womb of all female
animals viewed generally. For the wombs of all female
animals are not identical, neither do their local dispositions
coincide.
These aie the organs, internal and external, of man, and 497b
such is their nature and such their local disposition.

 BOOK II
497° With regard to animals in general, some parts or organs I
5 are common to all, as has been said, and some are common
only to particular genera ;1 the parts, moreover, are identical
with or different from one another on the lines already
repeatedly laid down. For as a general rule all animals
io that are generically distinct have the majority of their parts
or organs different in form or species ; and some of them they
have only analogically similar 2 and diverse in kind or genus,
while they have others that are alike in kind but specifically
diverse ; and many parts or organs exist in some animals,
but not in others.
For instance, viviparous quadrupeds have all a head and
i5 a neck, and all the parts or organs of the head, but they
differ each from other in the shapes of the parts. The lion
has its neck composed of one single bone instead of
vertebrae ;3 but, when dissected, the animal is found in all
internal characters to resemble the dog.
The quadrupedal vivipara instead of arms have forelegs.4
This is true of all quadrupeds, but such of them as have
20 toes have, practically speaking, organs analogous to hands ;
at all events, they use these fore-limbs for many purposes
as hands. And they have the limbs on the left-hand side
less distinct from those on the right than man.5
1 The main subject of this Book is to define the great genera of sanguineous animals, the viviparous and oviparous quadrupeds, the birds and fishes, though many instances of specific diversity are introduced parenthetically. In the opening sentences, which must be read together with those of Book I, brevity leads to a certain appearance of confusion: we are reminded that a generic difference between two animals carries with it generic difference between certain parts as well as specific differences between many others; but it now goes without saying that in animals which are specifically identical the parts are also specifically identical, and that in animals which are akin generically but diverse specifically the parts also are generically alike but are more or less specifically diverse. 2 H.A. i. 1. 486b 19, &c. 3 P. A. iv. 10. 686a 21 ; Ael. iv. 34; cf. Wiegmann, Obs. crit., p. 3. 4 A. and W. cj. (dvri St %fipd>v TrdSa?). 6 Wiegmann, Picc., and Dittm. bracket this sentence, which is at


 BOOK II. i 497
The fore-limbs then serve more or less the purpose of
hands in quadrupeds, with the exception of the elephant.
This latter animal has its toes somewhat indistinctly defined,1
and its front legs are much bigger than its hinder ones; it
is five-toed, and has short ankles to its hind feet. But it 25
has a nose such in properties and such in size as to allow
of its using the same for a hand.2 For it eats and drinks
by lifting up its food with the aid of this organ into its
mouth, and with the same organ it lifts up articles 3 to the
driver on its back ; with this organ it can pluck up trees by
the roots, and when walking through water it spouts the
water up by means of it;4 and this organ is capable of 30
being crooked or coiled at the tip, but not of flexing like
a joint, for it is composed of gristle.
Of all animals man alone can learn to make equal use of
both hands.5
All animals have a part analogous to the chest in man,
best parenthetical; A. and W., substituting bniodia for dpicrrepd, are in obvious error. Cf. de Inc. 4. 7o6a 18 dnoXeXvpeua e\ovai ra dpiarepd twv {coon/ paXiara uvdpanroi did to Kara (ftviTiv e^eiv pdXiara tiov £(0(ov'

While dnoXeXvp.eva is difficult to translate, the meaning clearly is that the left side is less dependent on, less inferior to, less contrasted with, the right in quadrupeds than in mankind. The chief contrast, according to A., is that the right side is kivovv, the left kivovp.evov [de Inc. 4. 705b 30 ; cf. H. A. ii. I. 49813 7); and in the above-quoted passage we are told that, as man represents Nature’s design better than the brutes, so it is man that exhibits most clearly this particular differentiation. The idea may have arisen from the fact that man is accustomed to carry a burden on his left shoulder (cf. de Inc. 4. 7o6a 2), while an animal bears it evenly on its back. But over and above this, the statement is part of the general superstitious belief as to the inferiority of the left side—a tenet of the Pythagoreans (cf. de Caelo, ii. 2. 284b 6, fr. 195. 1513a 15). The right-hand side of the body is said to be warmer than the left, especially in man [G.A. iv. 1. 765^ I ; cf. P. A. ii. 2. 648a 12), and its organs, except the eye and ear, stronger [Probl. xxxi. 18. 959a 20); males are said by Anaxagoras and others to be conceived on the right side, females on the left [G.A. iv. 1. 763b 33), &c. Cf. also P. A. iv. 8. 684a 28, &c. 1 H. A. iii. 9. 517a 32. 2 P. A. ii. 16. 658b 33, iv. 12. 692b 17; Plin. viii. 10, xi. 105 ; Opp. Cyn. ii. 524. J Dittm. cj. nav opeyei. 4 See also II.

but not similar to his ; for the chest in man is broad, but
that of all other animals is narrow.1 Moreover, no other
animal but man has breasts in front;2 the elephant,
498a certainly, has two breasts, not however in the chest, but
near it.
Moreover, also, animals have the flexions of their fore
and hind limbs in directions opposite to one another, and in
directions the reverse of those observed in the arms and
legs of man ; with the exception of the elephant.;; In
5 other words, with the viviparous quadrupeds the front
legs bend forwards and the hind ones backwards, and the
concavities4 of the two pairs of limbs thus face one
another.
The elephant does not sleep standing, as some were wont
to assert, but it bends its legs and settles down ; only that
io in consequence of its weight it cannot bend its legs on both
sides simultaneously, but falls into a recumbent position on
one side or the other, and in this position it goes to sleep.5
And it bends its hind legs just as a man bends his legs.6
In the case of the ovipara, as the crocodile and the lizard
15 and the like, both pairs of legs, fore and hind, bend forwards,
with a slight swerve to one side.7 The flexion is similar in
the case of the multipeds ; only that the legs in between
the extreme ends always move in a manner intermediate
between that of those in front and those behind, and
accordingly bend sideways rather than backwards or
forwards.8 But man bends his arms and his legs towards
20 the same point, and therefore in opposite ways : that is to

A. iv. 10. 687b 25 ; de Inc. 13. 712* 11. A. is thinking of the elbow and knee in the elephant, as also in man : but of the wrist and ankle (knee and hock) of such an animal as the horse. 7 This is at variance with fact, and with the statements in the de Incessu (e. g. 13. 7i2a 9) that no quadruped flexes its fore and hind limbs in the same direction : hence Wiegmann and Piccolos insert ds TovjriaOev after ra upoaOm.

 BOOK II. i 498a
say, he bends his arms backwards, with just a slight
inclination inwards,1 and his legs frontwards. No animal
bends both its fore-limbs and hind-limbs backwards ;
but in the case of all animals the flexion of the shoulders
is in the opposite direction to that of the elbows or
the joints of the forelegs, and the flexure in the hips 25
to that of the knees of the hind-legs:2 so that since man
differs from other animals in flexion, those animals that
possess such parts as these move them contrariwise to
man.3
Birds have the flexions of their limbs like those of
the quadrupeds ; for, although bipeds, they bend their legs
backwards, and instead of arms or front legs have wings 30
which bend frontwards.4
The seal is a kind of imperfect or crippled quadruped ;5
for just behind the shoulder-blade its front feet are placed,
resembling hands, like the front paws of the bear ; for they
are furnished with five toes, and each of the toes has three 498b
flexions and a nail of inconsiderable size. The hind feet
are also furnished with five toes; in their flexions and nails
they resemble the front feet, and in shape they resemble
a fish’s tail.
The movements of animals, quadruped and multiped, are 5
crosswise, or in diagonals, and their equilibrium in standing
posture is maintained crosswise ; and it is always the limb
on the right-hand side that is the first to move.6 The lion,
however, and the two species of camel, both the Bactrian

and the Arabian, progress by an amble ; and the action
so called is when the animal never overpasses the right foot
io with the left, but always follows close upon it.1
Whatever parts men have in front, these parts quadrupeds
have below, in or on the belly ; and whatever parts men
have behind, these parts quadrupeds have above on their
backs. Most quadrupeds have a tail; for even the seal has
a tiny one resembling that of the stag. Regarding the
J5 tails of the pithecoids we must give their distinctive
properties by and by.2
All viviparous quadrupeds are hair-coated, whereas man
has only a few short hairs excepting on the head,3 but, so
far as the head is concerned, he is hairier than any other
animal.4 Further, of hair-coated animals, the back is
20 hairier than the belly, which latter is either comparatively
void of hair or smooth and void of hair altogether.5 * With
man the reverse is the case.
Man also has upper and lower eyelashes, and hair under
the armpits and on the pubes. No other animal has hair in
either of these localities, or has an under eyelash; though
25 in the case of some animals a few straggling hairs grow
under the eyelid.'3
Of hair-coated quadrupeds some are hairy all over the
body, as the pig, the bear, and the dog; others7 are especially
hairy on the neck and all round about it, as is the case
with animals that have a shaggy mane, such as the lion;
others again are especially hairy on the upper surface of the
30 neck from the head as far as the withers, namely, such as
have a crested mane,8 as is the case with the horse, the
1 Plin. (xi. 105) translates literally ‘ pedatim, hoc est ut sinister pes non transeat dextrum sed subsequatur’. The passage is very obscure. An amble is, properly speaking, the mode of progression in which both legs of one side follow both legs of the other, instead of moving criss-cross, and this indeed appears to be the gait of the camel. If this be what is meant here, we might conjecture the omission of a word, e. g. ov npof^alvd rip apurrepio to 6<£ioj/ eVaXX<i£, «XX’ (TT(lKo\ovd(l (? ~6cos). Cf. II.

mule, and, among the undomesticated horned animals, the
bison.
The so-called hippelaphus1 also has a mane on its withers,
and the animal called pardion,2 in either case a thin mane
extending from the head to the withers ; the hippelaphus
has, exceptionally, a beard by the larynx. Both these 499tl
animals 3 have horns and are cloven-footed ; the female,
however, of the hippelaphus has no horns. This latter
animal resembles the stag in size ; it is found in the territory
of the Arachotae,4 where the wild cattle also are found.
Wild cattle5 differ from their domesticated congeners 5
just as the wild boar differs from the domesticated one.
That is to say they are black, strong looking, with a
hook-nosed muzzle, and with horns lying more over the
back. The horns of the hippelaphus resemble those of
the gazelle.
The elephant, by the way, is the least hairy of all
quadrupeds. With animals, as a general rule, the tail io
corresponds with the body as regards thickness or thinness
of hair-coating ; that is, with animals that have long tails,
for some creatures have tails of altogether insignificant size.
Camels6 have an exceptional organ wherein they differ
from all other animals, and that is the so-called ‘hump 5 on
their back. The Bactrian camel differs from the Arabian ;7
for the former has two humps and the latter only one, 15
though it has, by the way, a kind of a hump below like the
one above, on which, when it kneels, the weight of the
whole body rests. The camel has four teats like the cow,8
a tail like that of an ass, and the privy parts of the male
are directed backwards. It has one knee in each leg, and
the flexures of the limb are not manifold, as some say, 20
although they appear to be so from the constricted shape
of the region of the belly.9 It has a huckle-bone like that

of kine, but meagre and small in proportion to its bulk.1
It is cloven-footed, and has not got teeth in both jaws;2
and it is cloven-footed in the following way: at the back
there is a slight cleft extending as far up as the second
25 joint of the toes ; and in front there are small hooves on
the tip of the first joint of the toes;3 and a sort of web
passes across the cleft, as in geese. The foot is fleshy under¬
neath, like that of the bear ; so that, when the animal goes to
30 war, they protect its feet, when they get sore, with sandals.4
The legs of all quadrupeds are bony, sinewy, and flesh¬
less ; and in point of fact such is the case with all animals
499b that are furnished with feet, with the exception of man.5
They are also unfurnished with buttocks; and this last
point is plain in an especial degree in birds. It is the
reverse with man ; for there is scarcely any part of the
body in which man is so fleshy as in the buttock, the thigh,
5 and the calf;G for the part of the leg called gastrocnemia
or ‘ calf ’ is fleshy.7
Of blooded and viviparous quadrupeds some have the foot
cloven into many parts, as is the case with the hands and
feet of man (for some animals, by the way, are many-toed,
as the lion, the dog, and the pard); others have feet cloven
in twain, and instead of nails have hooves, as the sheep, the
10 goat, the deer, and the hippopotamus ;8 others are uncloven
of foot, such for instance as the solid-hooved animals, the
imuaraais; the latter would seem to be meaningless here (cf. Hippocr. Art. 806). With the general statement cf. Herod, iii. 103 KaprjXos ev rolcn onicrdloMji crKtXecri e^ei recrcrepas prjpovs fen't yovvara recaepa l cf. also Ael. x. 3. 1 Plin. xi. 105. 2 apefiudov and its converse always refer only to the front or incisor teeth.

horse and the mule. Swine are either cloven-footed or
uncloven-footed; for there are in Illyria and in Paeonia
and elsewhere solid-hooved swine.1 The cloven-footed
animals have two clefts behind;2 in the solid-hooved this
part is continuous and undivided.
Furthermore, of animals some are horned, and some are 15
not so. The great majority of the horned animals are
cloven-footed, as the ox, the stag, the goat; and a solid
hooved animal with a pair of horns has never yet been met
with. But a few animals are known to be single-horned
and single-hooved, as the Indian ass;3 and one, to wit the
oryx,4 is single-horned and cloven-hooved.
Of all solid-hooved animals the Indian ass alone has an 20
astragalus or huckle-bone; for the pig, as was said above,
is either solid-hooved or cloven-footed, and consequently
has no well-formed huckle-bone.5 * Of the cloven-footed
many are provided with a huckle-bone.0 Of the many¬
fingered or many-toed, no single one has been observed to
have a huckle-bone,7 none of the others any more than
man. The lynx, however, has something like a hemi

have it in the hinder legs. They have also the bone placed
straight up in the joint; the upper part, outside ; the lower
part, inside; the sides called Coa1 turned towards one
anothci, the sides called Cilia 1 outside, and the keraiae or
■>° h°rns 011 the top. This, then, is the position of the
huckle-bone in the case of all animals provided with the part.
Some animals aie, at one and the same time, furnished
with a mane and furnished also with a pair of horns bent
500a in towards one another, as is the bison (or aurochs),12 which
is found in Paeonia and Maedica.3 But all animals that
are horned are quadrupedal, except in cases where a
cieatuie is said metaphorically, or by a figure of speech,
to have horns ; just as the Egyptians describe the serpents4’
found in the neighbourhood of Thebes, while in point of
5 ^le creatures have merely protuberances on the head
sufficiently large to suggest such an epithet.
Of horned animals the deer alone has a horn, or antler,
hard and solid throughout.' The horns of other animals
are hollow for a certain distance, and solid towards the
extremity. The hollow part is derived from the skin,0 but
the core round which7 this is wrapped—the hard part—is
derived from the bones; as is the case with the horns of
10 oxen. The deer is the only animal that sheds its horns,
and it does so annually, after reaching the age of two years,
and again renews them. All other animals retain their
horns permanently, unless the horns be damaged by accident.
Again, with regard to the breasts and the generative
organs, animals differ widely from one another and from
15 man. For instance, the breasts of some animals are
situated in front, either in the chest or near to it, and there

 BOOK II. i 5°oa
are in such cases two breasts and two teats, as is the case
with man and the elephant,1 as previously stated.2 For
the elephant has two breasts in the region of the axillae ;
and the female elephant has two breasts insignificant in
size and in no way proportionate to the bulk of the entire 20
frame, in fact, so insignificant as to be invisible in a side¬
ways view; the males also have breasts, like the females,
exceedingly small. The she-bear has four breasts. Some
animals have two breasts, but situated near the thighs, and
teats, likewise two in number, as the sheep; others have
four teats, as the cow. Some have breasts neither in the 25
chest nor at the thighs, but in the belly, as the dog and
pig; and they have a considerable number of breasts or
dugs, but not all of equal size. Thus the she-pard has four
dugs in the belly, the lioness two, and others more. The
she-camel, also, has two dugs and four teats, like the cow. 3°
Of solid-hooved animals the males have no dugs, excepting
in the case of males that take after the mother, which
phenomenon is observable in horses.3
Of male animals the genitals 4 of some are external, as is
the case with man, the horse, and most other creatures;
some are internal, as with the dolphin. With those that soob
have the organ externally placed, the organ in some cases
is situated in front, as in the cases already mentioned, and
of these some have the organ detached, both penis and
testicles, as man ; others have penis and testicles closely
attached to the belly, some more closely, some less; for 5
this organ is not detached in the wild boar nor in the
horse.
The penis of the elephant resembles that of the horse ;
compared with the size of the animal it is disproportionately
small; the testicles are not visible, but are concealed inside
in the vicinity of the kidneys; and for this reason the male
speedily gives over in the act of intercourse.5 The genitals of 10

the female are situated where the udder is in sheep; when
she is in heat, she draws the organ back and exposes it
externally, to facilitate the act of intercourse for the male ;
and the organ opens out to a considerable extent.
With most animals the genitals have the position above
15 assigned ; but some animals discharge their urine back¬
wards,1 as the lynx, the lion, the camel, and the hare.
Male animals differ from one another, as has been said, in
this particular, but all female animals are retromingent:
even the female elephant like other animals, though she
has 2 the privy part below the thighs.
20 In the male organ itself there is a great diversity. For
in some cases the organ is composed of flesh and gristle,3
as in man ; in such cases, the fleshy part does not become
inflated,4 but the gristly part is subject to enlargement. In
other cases, the organ is composed of fibrous tissue, as with
the camel and the deer; in other cases it is bony,5 as with
the fox, the wolf, the marten, and the weasel; for this organ
25 in the weasel has a bone.
When man has arrived at maturity, his upper part is
smaller than the lower one,'; but with all other blooded
animals the reverse holds good. By the‘upper’ part we
mean all extending from the head down to the parts used
for excretion of residuum, and by the ‘ lower ’ part all else.
30 With animals that have feet the hind legs are to be rated
as the lower part in our comparison of magnitudes, and
with animals devoid of feet, the tail,7 and the like.
When animals arrive at maturity, their properties are as
above stated ; but they differ greatly from one another in
their growth towards maturity. For instance, man, when
young, has his upper part larger than the lower, but in
5oia course of growth he comes to reverse this condition ; and it
is owing to this circumstance that—an exceptional instance,
1 Cf. P.A. iv. 10. 689® 31. 2 Reading with A. and W. e\cov, or with Schn. Kalntp e\uv. Pice, stigmatizes the clause. 3 P.A. iv. 10. 689* 29. 4 nvfvpards ean bfKTinov, P.A. iv. 10.689*30; cf.

Bonitz, s. vocc., Schn. iii. p. 74, &c.


 BOOK II. i 5oi
by the way—he does not progress in early life as he does
at maturity, but in infancy creeps on all fours ; but some
animals, in growth, retain the relative proportion of the
parts, as the dog. Some animals at first have the upper
part smaller and the lower part larger, and in course of
growth the upper part gets to be the larger, as is the case 5
with the bushy-tailed animals such as the horse ; for in
their case there is never, subsequently to birth, any increase
in the part extending from the hoof to the haunch.1
Again, in respect to the teeth,2 animals differ greatly
both from one another and from man. All animals that
are quadrupedal, blooded, and viviparous, are furnished 10
with teeth ; but, to begin with, some are double-toothed
(or fully furnished with teeth in both jaws), and some are
not. For instance, horned quadrupeds are not double¬
toothed ; for they have not got the front teeth in the upper
jaw; and some hornless animals, also, are not double¬
toothed, as the camel. Some animals have tusks, like the 15
boar,3 and some have not. Further, some animals are saw¬
toothed, such as the lion, the pard, and the dog; and some
have teeth that do not interlock but have flat opposing
crowns, as the horse and the ox ; and by ‘ saw-toothed 5 we
mean such animals as interlock the sharp-pointed teeth in
one jaw between the sharp-pointed ones in the other. No
animal is there that possesses both tusks and horns, nor
yet do either of these structures exist in any animal pos- 20
sessed of ‘ saw-teeth \4 The front teeth are usually sharp,
and the back ones blunt. The seal is saw-toothed through¬
out,5 inasmuch as he is a sort of link with the class of fishes ;
for fishes are almost all saw-toothed.
No animal of these genera is provided with double rows of
teeth. There is, however, an animal of the sort, if we are to
believe Ctesias. He assures us that the Indian wild beast 25
called the ‘ martichoras ’u has a triple row of teeth in both

upper and lower jaw ; that it is as big as a lion and
equally hairy, and that its feet resemble those of the lion ;
that it resembles man in its face and ears; that its eyes
30 are blue, and its colour vermilion ; that its tail is like that
of the land-scorpion ; that it has a sting in the tail, and has
the faculty of shooting off arrow-wise 1 the spines that are
attached to the tail; that the sound of its voice is a some¬
thing between the sound of a pan-pipe and that of a trumpet;
that it can run as swiftly2 as a deer, and that it is savage
50ib and a man-eater.3
Man sheds his teeth, and so do other animals, as the
horse, the mule, and the ass. And man sheds his front
teeth ; but there is no instance of an animal that sheds its
molars.4 The pig sheds none of its teeth at all.
5 With regard to dogs some doubts are entertained, as 2
some contend that they shed no teeth whatever, and others
-that they shed the canines, but those alone ;5 the fact being,
that they do shed their teeth like man, but that the cir¬
cumstance escapes observation, owing to the fact that they
never shed them until equivalent teeth have grown within
the gums to take the place of the shed ones. We shall
be justified in supposing that the case is similar with wild
10 beasts in general; for they are said to shed their canines
only. Dogs can be distinguished from one another, the
young from the old, by their teeth ; for the teeth in young
dogs are white and sharp-pointed; in old dogs, black and
blunt.
In this particular, the horse differs entirely from animals *
15 in general : for, generally speaking, as animals grow older

their teeth get blacker, but the horse’s teeth grow whiter
with age.
The so-called ‘ canines ’ come in between the sharp teeth
and the broad or blunt ones, partaking of the form of
both kinds; for they are broad at the base and sharp at
the tip.
Males have more teeth than females in the case of men, 20
sheep, goats, and swine; in the case of other animals observa¬
tions have not yet been made : but the more teeth they
have the more long-lived are they, as a rule, while those are
short-lived in proportion that have teeth fewer in number
and thinly set.1
j. The last teeth to come in man are molars called ‘wisdom
teeth ,2 which come at the age of twenty years, in the case 25
of both sexes.3 Cases have been known in women upwards
of eighty years old where at the very close of life the
wisdom-teeth have come up, causing great pain in their
coming; and cases have been known of the like phenomenon
in men too. This happens, when it does happen, in the
case of people where the wisdom-teeth have not come up
in early years.
> The elephant has four teeth on either side, by which it 30
munches its food, grinding it like so much barley-meal, and,
quite apart from these, it has its great teeth, or tusks, two
in number.4 In the male these tusks are comparatively
large and curved upwards ; in the female, they are com¬
paratively small and point in the opposite direction ; that 502s
is, they look downwards towards the ground. The elephant
is furnished with teeth at birth, but the tusks are not then
visible.
i The tongue of the elephant5 is exceedingly small, and
situated far back in the mouth,0 so that it is difficult to get
a sight of it.

5 Furthermore, animals differ from one another in the 7
relative size of their mouths. In some animals the mouth
opens wide, as is the case with the dog, the lion, and with all
the saw-toothed animals ; other animals have small mouths,
as man ; and others have mouths of medium capacity, as
the pig and his congeners.
[The Egyptian hippopotamus1 has a mane like a horse,
10 is cloven-footed like an ox, and is snub-nosed. It has
a huckle-bone like cloven-footed animals, and tusks just
visible; it has the tail of a pig, the neigh of a horse,2 and
the dimensions of an ass. The hide is so thick that spears
are made out of it. In its internal organs it resembles the
15 horse and the ass.]
Some animals share the properties of man and the 8
quadrupeds, as the ape, the monkey, and the baboon. The
monkey is a tailed ape. The baboon 3 resembles the ape
20 in form, only that it is bigger and stronger, more like a dog
in face, and is more savage in its habits, and its teeth are
more dog-like and more powerful.
Apes are hairy on the back in keeping with their
quadrupedal nature, and hairy on the belly in keeping with
their human form—for, as was said above, this characteristic
25 is reversed in man and the quadruped 4—only that the hair
is coarse, so5 that the ape is thickly coated both on the
belly and on the back. Its face resembles that of man in
many respects; in other words, it has similar nostrils and
30 ears, and teeth like those of man, both front teeth and
molars. Further, whereas quadrupeds in general are not
furnished with lashes on one of the two eyelids, this creature
has them on both, only very thinly set, especially the under
ones ; in fact they are very insignificant indeed. And we

must bear in mind that all other quadrupeds have no under
eyelash at all.1
The ape has also in its chest two teats upon poorly
developed breasts. It has also arms like man, only covered
with hair, and it bends these legs like man, with the 502b
convexities of both limbs facing one another.2 In addition,
it has hands and fingers and nails like man, only that all
these parts are somewhat more beast-like in appearance.
Its feet are exceptional in kind. That is, they are like large 5
hands, and the toes are like fingers, with the middle one
the longest of all, and the under part of the foot is like
a hand except for its length,3 and stretches out towards the
extremities like the palm of the hand ; and this palm at
the after end is unusually hard, and in a clumsy obscure
kind of way resembles a heel. The creature uses its feet 10
either as hands or feet, and doubles them up as one doubles
a fist. Its upper-arm and thigh are short in proportion to
the forearm and the shin. It has no projecting navel, but
only a hardness in the ordinary locality of the navel. Its
upper part is much larger than its lower part, as is the case 15
with quadrupeds ; in fact, the proportion of the former to
the latter is about as five to three. Owing to this circum¬
stance and to the fact that its feet resemble hands and are
composed in a manner of hand and of foot : of foot in the
heel extremity, of the hand in all else—for even the toes
have what is called a ‘ palm ’ :—for these reasons the animal 20
is oftener to be found on all fours than upright. It has
neither hips, inasmuch as it is a quadruped,4 nor yet a
tail, inasmuch as it is a biped, except by the way that it
has a tail as small as small can be, just a sort of indication
of a tail. The genitals of the female resemble those of the
female in the human species ; those of the male are more
like those of a dog than are those of a man.
The monkey, as has been observed, is furnished with 25

a tail. In all such creatures the internal organs are found
under dissection to correspond to those of man.
So much then for the properties of the organs of such
animals as bring forth their young into the world alive.1
Oviparous and blooded quadrupeds—and, by the way, ic
no terrestrial2 blooded animal is oviparous unless it is
30 quadrupedal or is devoid of feet altogether—are furnished
with a head, a neck, a back, upper and under parts, the
front legs and hind legs, and the part analogous to the
chest, all as in the case of viviparous quadrupeds, and with
a tail, usually large, in exceptional cases small. And all
these creatures are many-toed, and the several toes are
cloven apart. Furthermore, they all have the ordinary
organs of sensation, including a tongue, with the exception
5°3a of the Egyptian crocodile.3
This latter animal, by the way, resembles certain fishes.
For, as a general rule, fishes have a prickly tongue,4 not
free in its movements ; though there are some fishes that
present a smooth undifferentiated surface where the tongue
should be, until you open their mouthswide and make
a close inspection.
Again, oviparous blooded quadrupeds are unprovided
5 with ears, but possess only the passage for hearing ; neither
have they breasts, nor a copulatory organ, nor external
testicles, but internal ones only ; neither are they hair-coated,
but are in all cases covered with scaly plates. Moreover,
they are without exception saw-toothed.
River crocodiles have pigs’ eyes, large teeth and tusks,
10 and strong nails, and an impenetrable skin composed of

scaly plates. They see but poorly under water, but above
the surface of it with remarkable acuteness. As a rule, they
pass the day-time on land and the night-time in the water;
for the temperature of the water is at night-time more
genial than that of the open air.
The chameleon1 resembles the lizard in the general 15
configuration of its body, but the ribs stretch downwards
and meet together under the belly as is the case with fishes,
and the spine sticks.up as with the fish. Its face resembles
that of the baboon.2 Its tail is exceedingly long, terminates
in a sharp point, and is for the most part coiled up, like 20
a strap of leather. It stands higher off the ground than
the lizard, but the flexure of the legs is the same in both
creatures. Each of its feet is divided into two parts, which
bear the same relation to one another that the thumb and
the rest of the hand bear to one another in man. Each of 25
these parts is for a short distance divided after a fashion
into toes; on the front feet the inside part is divided into
three and the outside into two, on the hind feet the inside
part into two and the outside into three; it has claws also
on these parts resembling those of birds of prey. Its body 30
is rough all over, like that of the crocodile. Its eyes are
situated in a hollow recess, and are very large and round,
and are enveloped in a skin resembling that which covers
the entire body ;3 and in the middle a slight aperture is
left for vision, through which the animal sees, for it never
covers up this aperture with the cutaneous envelope. It
keeps twisting its eyes round and shifting its line of vision 503b
in every direction, and thus contrives to get a sight of any
object that it wants to see. The change in its colour4 takes
place when it is inflated with air ; it is then black, not unlike
the crocodile, or green like the lizard but black-spotted 5
like the pard. This change of colour takes place over the

whole body alike, for the eyes and the tail come alike under
its influence. In its movements it is very sluggish, like the
io tortoise. It assumes a greenish hue in dying, and retains
this hue after death. It resembles the lizard in the position
of the oesophagus and the windpipe. It has no flesh any¬
where except a few scraps of flesh on the head and on the
jaws and near to the root of the tail. It has blood only
15 round about the heart, the eyes, the region above the heart,
and in all the veins extending from these parts ; and in all
these there is but little blood after all.1 The brain is
situated a little above the eyes, but connected with them.
When the outer skin is drawn aside from off the eye,
20 a something is found surrounding the eye, that gleams
through like a thin ring of copper.2 Membranes 3 extend
wellnigh over its entire frame, numerous and strong, and
surpassing in respect of number and relative strength those
found in any other animal. After being cut open along its
entire length it continues to breathe for a considerable
time ;4 a very slight motion goes on in the region of the
25 heart, and, while contraction is especially manifested in the
neighbourhood of the ribs, a similar motion is more or less
discernible over the whole body. It has no spleen visible.
It hibernates, like the lizard.
Birds 5 also in some parts resemble the above-mentioned 1
30 animals ; that is to say, they have in all cases a head, a
neck, a back, a belly, and what is analogous to the chest.
The bird is remarkable among animals as having two feet,
like man ; only, by the way, it bends them backwards as
quadrupeds bend their hind legs, as was noticed previously.0

haunch-bone is long, like a thigh, and is attached to the body 504
as far as the middle of the belly ;1 so like to a thigh is it
that when viewed separately it looks like a real one, while
the real thigh is a separate structure betwixt it2 and the
shin. Of all birds those that have crooked talons have the
biggest thighs and the strongest breasts. All birds are
furnished with many claws,3 and all have the toes separated 5
more or less asunder ; that is to say, in the greater part
the toes are clearly distinct from one another, for even
the swimming birds, although they are web-footed, have
still their claws fully articulated and distinctly differentiated
from one another. Birds that fly high in air are in all cases
four-toed: that is, the greater part have three toes in front 10
and one behind in place of a heel; some few have two in
front and two behind, as the wryneck.
This latter bird is somewhat bigger than the chaffinch,
and is mottled in appearance. It is peculiar in the arrange¬
ment of its toes,4 and resembles the snake in the structure of
its tongue ; for the creature can protrude its tongue to the
extent of four finger-breadths, and then draw it back again. 15
Moreover, it can twist its head backwards while keeping
all the rest of its body still, like the serpent. It has big
claws, somewhat resembling those of the woodpecker.5 Its
note is a shrill chirp.0
Birds are furnished with a mouth, but with an exceptional
one, for they have neither lips nor teeth, but a beak. 20
Neither have they ears nor a nose, but only passages for
the sensations connected with these organs: that for the
nostrils in the beak, and that for hearing in the head.
Like all other animals they all have two eyes, and these
are devoid of lashes. The heavy-bodied (or gallinaceous)

25 birds close the eye by means of the lower lid, and all birds
blink by means of a skin extending over the eye from the
inner corner; the owl and its congeners also close the eye
by means of the upper lid.1 The same phenomenon is
observable in the animals that are protected by horny scutes,
as in the lizard and its congeners; for they all without
exception close the eye with the lower lid, but they do not
blink like birds.2
?,o Further, birds have neither scutes nor hair, but feathers ;3
and the feathers are invariably furnished with quills.
They have no tail, but a rump 4 with tail-feathers, short
in such as are long-legged and web-footed, large in
others. These latter kinds of birds fly with their feet
tucked up close to the belly; but the small-rumped
or short-tailed birds fly with their legs stretched out at
full length. All are furnished with a tongue, but the
504b organ is variable, being long in some birds and broad in
others. Certain species of birds above all other animals,
and next after man, possess the faculty of uttering articulate
sounds; and this faculty is chiefly developed in broad
tongued birds.5 No oviparous creature has an epiglottis0
over the windpipe, but these animals so manage the open
5 ing and shutting of the windpipe as not to allow any solid
substance to get down into the lung.
Some species of birds are furnished additionally with
spurs, but no bird with crooked talons is found so provided.
The birds with talons are among those that fly well, but
those that have spurs are among the heavy-bodied.
10 Again, some birds have a crest. As a general rule the
crest sticks up, and is composed of feathers only; but the
crest of the barn-door cock is exceptional in kind, for,
whereas it is not just exactly flesh, at the same time it is
not easy to say what else it is.

 BOOK II. 13 5°4b
13 Of water animals the genus of fishes constitutes a single
group apart from the rest, and including many diverse
forms.1
In the first place, the fish has a head, a back, a belly, in 15
the neighbourhood of which last are placed the stomach
and viscera; and behind it has a tail of continuous, un¬
divided shape, but not, by the .way, in all cases alike. No
fish has a neck, or any limb, or testicles 2 at all, within or
without, or breasts. Rut, by the way, this absence of breasts
may be predicated of all non-viviparous animals ; and in 20
point of fact viviparous animals are not in all cases provided
with the organ, excepting such as are directly viviparous
without being first oviparous. Thus the dolphin is directly
viviparous, and accordingly we find it furnished with two
breasts,3 not situated high up, but in the neighbourhood of
the genitals. And this creature is not provided, like
quadrupeds, with visible teats, but has two vents, one on
each flank, from which the milk flows ; and its young have 25
to follow after it to get suckled, and this phenomenon has
been actually witnessed.
Fishes, then, as has been observed, have no breasts and
no passage for the genitals visible externally. But they
have an exceptional organ in the gills, whereby, after
taking the water in by the mouth, they discharge it again;
and in the fins, of which the greater part have four, and the 3°
lan'ky ones two, as, for instance, the eel, and these two
situated near to the gills.4 In like manner the grey mullet
as, for instance, the mullet found in the lake at Siphae 5
have only two fins ; and the same is the case with the fish
called Ribbon-fish.Some of the lanky fishes have no fins
1 Idea, frequent in A. of a logical species, is not used of the species of animals or plants. It may here mean the sensible species, and thus be all but identical with /xop^r;, cf. Schn. ‘piscium genus solum ab aliis multarum ambitu formarum distinctum est’. 2 Cf. H. A. v. 5. 5qoh 28, &c. 3 H. A. iii. 20. 52ib 23 ; Plin. xi. 95. 4 H. A. i. 5. 48913 23 ; P.

at all, such as the muraena, nor gills articulated 1 like those
of other fish.
And of those fish that are provided with gills, some have
505s coverings for this organ, whereas all the selachians have
the organ unprotected by a cover. And those fishes that
have coverings or opercula for the gills have in all cases
their gills placed sideways; whereas, among selachians,
the broad ones have the gills down below on the belly, as
the torpedo and the ray, while the lanky ones have the
5 organ placed sideways, as is the case in all the dog-fish.
The fishing-frog has gills placed sideways, and covered
not with a spiny operculum, as in all but the selachian
fishes, but with one of skin.
Morever, with fishes furnished with gills,2 the gills in some
cases are simple in others duplicate ; and the last gill in the
direction of the body is always simple. And, again, some
io fishes have few gills, and others have a great number; but
all alike have the same number on both sides. Those
that have the least number have one gill on either side,
and this one duplicate, like the boar-fish; others have
two on either side, one simple and the other duplicate, like
the conger and the scarus ; 3 others have four on either side,
15 simple, as the elops,4 the synagris,5 the muraena, and the
eel; others have four, all, with the exception of the hind¬
most one, in double rows, as the wrasse,'1 the perch, the
sheat-fish, and the carp. The dog-fish have all their gills
double, five on a side; and the sword-fish has eight7
with y\rrjTTa and fiovyXaxjaos, from which we might infer it to be a Pleuronectid. 1 dirjpdpufjLtva probably means close-se/, well-knit, i. e. with the filaments linked together, as is usual in fishes; the gill-filaments of the muraena are loose and float apart. 2 Plin. ix. 32. 3 Scarus cretcnsis, the parrot-wrasse ; mod.

double gills.1 So much for the number of gills as found in
fishes.
Again, fishes differ from other animals in more ways than 20
as regards the gills. For they are not covered with hairs
as are viviparous land animals, nor, as is the case with
certain oviparous quadrupeds, with tessellated scutes, nor,
like birds, with feathers ; but for the most part they are
covered with scales. Some few are rough-skinned, while 25
the smooth-skinned are very few indeed. Of the Selachia
some are rough-skinned and some smooth-skinned;2 and
among the smooth-skinned fishes are included the conger,
the eel, and the tunny.
All fishes are saw-toothed excepting the scarus ;3 and
the teeth in all cases are sharp and set in many rows, and
in some cases are placed on the tongue.^ The tongue is
hard and spiny, and so firmly attached that fishes in many 30
instances seem to be devoid of the organ altogether. The
mouth in some cases 5 is wide-stretched, as it is with some
viviparous quadrupeds. . ..
With regard to organs of sense, all save eyes, fishes
possess none of them, neither the organs nor their passages,
neither ears nor nostrils; but all fishes are furnished with
eyes, and the eyes devoid of lids, though the eyes are not
hard;6 with regard to the organs connected with the other
senses, hearing and smell, they are devoid alike of the
organs themselves and of passages indicative of them.
Fishes without exception are supplied with blood. Some 505b
of them are oviparous, and some viviparous; scaly fish
are invariably oviparous, but cartilaginous fishes are all
viviparous, with the single exception of the fishing-frog.7

 HISTORIA ANTMALIUM
5°5b
5 Of blooded animals there now remains the serpent genus. 14
This genus is common to both elements, for, while most
species comprehended therein are land animals, a small
minority, to wit the aquatic species, pass their lives in
fresh water. There are also sea-serpents,1 in shape to a
great extent resembling their congeners of the land, with
this exception that the head in their case is somewhat
10 like the head of the conger; and there are several kinds
of sea-serpent, and the different kinds differ in colour ;
these animals are not found in very deep water. Serpents,
like fish, are devoid of feet.
There are also sea-scolopendras,2 resembling in shape
their land congeners, but somewhat less in regard to
magnitude. These creatures are found in the neighbour
15 hood of rocks ; as compared with their land congeners
they are redder in colour, are furnished with feet in greater
numbers and with legs of more delicate structure. And
the same remark applies to them as to the sea-serpents, that
they are not found in very deep water.
Of fishes whose habitat is in the vicinity of rocks there is a
tiny one, which some call the Echeneis,3 or ‘ship-holder’,
and which is by some people used as a charm to bring luck
20 in affairs of law and love. The creature is unfit for eating.
Some people assert that it has feet, but this is not the case :
it appears, however, to be furnished with feet from the
fact that its fins resemble those organs.
So much, then, for the external parts of blooded animals,
as regards their numbers, their properties, and their relative
diversities.
25 As for the properties of the internal organs, these we 15
must first discuss in the case of the animals that are supplied
with blood. For the principal genera differ from the rest of

Romano, Nautica Mediterranean Roma, 1607. The myth of the ‘ shipholder’ has been elegantly explained by V. W. Ekman, ‘On Dead Water,’ in the Reports of Nansen’s North Polar Expedition, Christiania, 1904.


 BOOK II. 15 505"
animals, in that the former are supplied with blood and
the latter are not; and the former include man, viviparous
and oviparous quadrupeds, birds, fishes, cetaceans, and all
the others that come under no general designation by reason 30
of their not forming genera, but groups of which simply the
specific name is predicable,1 as when we say ‘ the serpent ’,
‘ the crocodile \
All viviparous quadrupeds, then, are furnished with an
oesophagus and a windpipe, situated as in man; the same
statement is applicable to oviparous quadrupeds and to
birds, only that the latter present diversities in the shapes
of these organs. As a general rule, all animals that take 5o6a
up air and breathe it in and out are furnished with a lung,
a windpipe, and an oesophagus, with the windpipe and
oesophagus not admitting of diversity in situation but
admitting of diversity in properties, and with the lung
admitting of diversity in both these respects. Further, all
blooded animals have a heart and a diaphragm or midriff; 5
but in small animals the existence of the latter organ is
not so obvious owing to its delicacy and minute size.
In regard to the heart2 there is an exceptional pheno¬
menon observable in oxen. In other words, there is one
species of ox where, though not in all cases, a bone is found
inside the heart.0 And, by the way, the horse’s heart also 10
has a bone inside it.
The genera referred to above are not in all cases furnished
with a lung : for instance, the fish is devoid of the organ,
as is also every animal furnished with gills. All blooded
animals are furnished with a liver. As a general rule
blooded animals are furnished with a spleen ; but with
the gieat majority of non-viviparous but oviparous animals

15 the spleen is so small as all but to escape observation ;1
and this is the case with almost all birds, as with the pigeon,
the kite, the falcon, the owl: in point of fact, the aego
cephalus2 is devoid of the organ altogether. With oviparous
quadrupeds the case is much the same as with the vivi¬
parous ; that is to say, they also have the spleen exceedingly
minute, as the tortoise, the freshwater tortoise, the toad,
20 the lizard, the crocodile, and the frog.
Some animals have a gall-bladder close to the liver, and
others have not. Of viviparous quadrupeds the deer is
without the organ," as also the roe, the horse, the mule, the
ass, the seal, and some kinds of pigs.4 Of deer those that
are called Achainae5 appear to have gall in their tail, but
25 what is so called does resemble gall in colour, though it is
not so completely fluid, and the organ internally6 resembles
a spleen.
However, without any exception, stags are found to have
maggots living inside the head,7 and the habitat of these
creatures is in the hollow underneath the root of the tongue
and in the neighbourhood of the vertebra to which the head
is attached. These creatures are as large as the largest
30 grubs ; they grow all together in a cluster, and they are
usually about twenty in number.8
Deer then, as has been observed, are without a gall¬
bladder ; their gut, however, is so bitter that even hounds
refuse to eat it unless the animal is exceptionally fat.9 With
5°6b the elephant also the liver is unfurnished with a gall¬
bladder, but when the animal is cut in the region where the
organ is found in animals furnished with it, there oozes
out a fluid resembling gall, in greater or less quantities.
Of animals that take in sea-water and are furnished with a

lung, the dolphin is unprovided with a gall-bladder. Birds
and fishes all have the organ,1 as also oviparous quadrupeds,
all to a greater or a lesser extent. But of fishes some have
the organ close to the liver, as the dog-fishes, the sheat-fish,
the rhine or angel-fish, the smooth skate, the torpedo,
and, of the lanky fishes, the eel, the pipe-fish,2 and the
hammer-headed shark. The callionymus,3 also, has the
gall-bladder close to the liver, and in no other fish does
the organ attain so great a relative size.4 Other fishes have
the organ close to the gut, attached to the liver by certain
extremely fine ducts. The bonito has the gall-bladder
stretched alongside the gut and equalling it in length, and
often a double fold of it. Others have the organ in the
region of the gut; in some cases far off, in others near ; as
the fishing-frog, the elops, the synagris, the muraena, and
the sword-fish. Often animals of the same species show
this diversity of position ; as, for instance, some congers are
found with the organ attached close to the liver, and others
with it detached from and below it. The case is much
the same with birds: that is, some have the gall-bladder
close to the stomach, and others close to the gut, as the
pigeon, the raven, the quail, the swallow, and the sparrow;
some have it near at once to the liver and to the stomach
as the aegocephalus ; others have it near at once to the
liver and the gut, as the falcon and the kite.
5 Again, all viviparous quadrupeds are furnished with
kidneys and a bladder.5 Of the ovipara that are not quad¬
rupedal there is no instance known of an animal, whether
fish or bird, provided with these organs. Of the ovipara

that arc quadrupedal, the turtle alone is provided with these
organs 1 2 of a magnitude to correspond with the other organs
of the animal. In the turtle the kidney resembles the
same organ in the ox ; that is to say, it looks like one
30 single organ composed of a number of small ones. [The
bison also resembles the ox in all its internal parts.]
With all animals that are furnished with these parts, the
parts are similarly situated, and with the exception of
man, the heart is in the middle ; in man, however, as has
5°7a been observed, the heart is placed a little to the left-hand
side.3 In all animals the pointed end of the heart turns
frontwards ; only in fish it would at first sight seem other¬
wise, for the pointed end is turned not towards the breast,
but towards the head and the mouth.3 And (in fish) the
5 apex is attached to a tube 4 just where the right and left
gills meet together. There are other ducts extending from
the heart to each of the gills, greater in the greater fish,
lesser in the lesser ; but in the large fishes the duct at the
pointed end of the heart is a tube, white-coloured and
exceedingly thick.
10 Fishes in some few cases have an oesophagus, as the
conger and the eel ; and in these the organ is small.
In fishes that are furnished with an undivided liver, the
organ lies entirely on the right side; where the liver is cloven
from the root, the larger half of the organ is on the right
side : for in some fishes the two parts are detached from one
15 another, without any coalescence at the root, as is the case
• with the dog-fish. And there is also a species of hare 5 in what
is named the Fig district, near Lake Bolbe,6 and elsewhere,

which animal might be taken to have two livers owing to
the length of the connecting ducts,1 similar to the structure
in the lung of birds.
The spleen in all cases, when normally placed, is on the
left-hand side, and the kidneys also lie in the same position 20
in all creatures that possess them.2 There have been known
instances of quadrupeds under dissection, where the spleen
was on the right hand and the liver on the left ; but all
such cases are regarded as supernatural.
In all animals the wind-pipe extends to the lung, and
the manner how, we shall discuss hereafter; and the oeso- 25
phagus,3 in all that have the organ, extends through the
midriff into the stomach. For, by the way, as has been
observed, most fishes have no oesophagus, but the stomach
is united directly with the mouth, so that in some cases
when big fish are pursuing little ones, the stomach 4 tumbles
forward into the mouth.
All the afore-mentioned animals have a stomach, and 30
one similarly situated, that is to say, situated directly under
the midriff; and they have a gut connected therewith and
closing at the outlet of the residuum and at what is termed
the ‘ rectum ’. However, animals present diversities in the
structure of their stomachs.5 In the first place, of the
viviparous quadrupeds, such of the horned animals as are
not equally furnished with teeth in both jaws are furnished 35
with four such chambers.0 These animals, by the way, are
those that are said to chew the cud.7 In these animals the
oesophagus extends from the mouth downwards along
the lung, from the midriff to the big stomach (or paunch); 5o7b
and this stomach is rough inside and semi-partitioned.8

And connected with it near to the entry of the oesophagus
is what from its appearance is termed the 1 reticulum ’(or
honeycomb bag) ; for outside it is like the stomach, but
5 inside it resembles a netted cap; and the reticulum is a
great deal smaller than the stomach. Connected with this
is the‘echinus’ (or many-plies),rough inside and laminated,
and of about the same size as the reticulum. Next after
this comes what is called the ‘ enystrum ’ (or abomasum),
10 larger and longer than the echinus, furnished inside with
numerous folds or ridges, large and smooth. After all this
comes the gut.
Such is the stomach of those quadrupeds that are horned
and have an unsymmetrical dentition ; and these animals
differ one from another in the shape and size of the parts,
and in the fact of the oesophagus reaching the stomach
J5 centralwise in some cases and sideways in others. Animals
that are furnished equally with teeth in both jaws have one
stomach ; as man, the pig, the dog, the bear, the lion, the
wolf. [The Thos,1 by the by, has all its internal organs
similar to the wolf’s.]
All these, then have a single 2 stomach, and after that
the gut; but the stomach in some is comparatively large.
20 as in the pig and bear, and the stomach of the pig has a
few smooth folds or ridges ; others have a much smaller
stomach, not much biggerthan the gut, as the lion, the dog,
and man. In the other animals the shape of the stomach
varies in the direction of one or other of those already
mentioned ; that is, the stomach in some animals resembles
that of the pig; in others that of the dog, alike with the
larger animals and the smaller ones. In all these animals
25 diversities occur in regard to the size, the shape, the thick¬
ness or the thinness of the stomach, and also in regard to
the place 3 where the oesophagus opens into it.
There is also a difference in structure in the gut of the
two groups of animals above mentioned (those with unsym

metrical and those with symmetrical dentition) in size, in
thickness, and in foldings. 30
The intestines in those animals whose jaws are unequally
furnished with teeth are in all cases the larger, for the
animals themselves are larger than those in the other
category ; for very few of them are small, and no single one
of the horned animals is very small. And some possess
appendages (or caeca) to the gut, but no animal that has
not incisors in both jaws has a straight gut.
The elephant has a gut constricted into chambers,1 so 35
constructed that the animal appears to have four stomachs ;
in it the food is found, but there is no distinct and separate
receptacle. Its viscera resemble those of the pig, only that
the liver is four times the size of that of the ox, and 5°S
the other viscera in like proportion, while the spleen is
comparatively small.
Much the same may be predicated of the properties
of the stomach and the gut in oviparous quadrupeds, as in
the land tortoise, the turtle, the lizard, both crocodiles,2 and,5
in fact, in all animals of the like kind ; that is to say, their
stomach is one and simple, resembling in some cases that
of the pig, and in other cases that of the dog.
The serpent genus is similar and in almost all respects
furnished similarly to the saurians among oviparous land
animals, if one could only imagine these saurians to be 10
increased in length and to be devoid of legs. That is to
say, the serpent is coated with tessellated scutes, and
resembles the saurian in its back and belly; only, by the
way, it has no testicles, but, like fishes, has two ducts con¬
verging into one, and an ovary long and bifurcate. The
rest of its internal organs are identical with those of the
saurians, except that, owing to the narrowness and length 15
of the animal, the viscera are correspondingly narrow and
elongated, so that they are apt to escape recognition from
the similarities in shape. Thus, the windpipe of the creature
is exceptionally long, and the oesophagus is longer still,
1 Plin. xi. 79. 2 i.e. land and water, the former being a large lizard, e.g. Varanus or Stellio : cf. fr. 320, I532a 25.


 HISTORIA ANIMALIUM
5o8a
and the windpipe commences so close to the mouth that
the tongue appears to be underneath it ; and the windpipe
20 seems to project over the tongue, owing to the fact that
the tongue draws back into a sheath and does not remain
in its place as in other animals. The tongue, moreover, is
thin and long and black, and can be protruded to a great
distance. And both serpents and saurians have this alto¬
gether exceptional property in the tongue, that it is forked
25 at the outer extremity,1 and this property is the more
marked in the serpent, for the tips of his tongue are
as thin as hairs. The seal, also, by the way, has a split
tongue.2
The stomach of the serpent is like a more spacious
gut, resembling the stomach of the dog ; then comes the
gut, long, narrow, and single to the end. The heart is
30 situated close to the pharynx, small3 and kidney-shaped ; *
and for this reason the organ might in some cases4 appear
not to have the pointed end turned towards the breast.
Then comes the lung, single, and articulated with a mem¬
branous passage, very long, and quite detached from the
heart. The liver is long and simple ; the spleen is short
and round : as is the case in both respects with the
35 saurians. Its gall resembles that of the fish ; the water
5o8b snakes have it beside the liver, and the other snakes have
it usually beside the gut. These creatures are all saw¬
toothed. Their ribs are as numerous as the days of the
month ; in other words, they are thirty in number.
Some affirm that the same phenomenon is observable
5 with serpents as with swallow-chicks; in other words, they
say that if you prick out a serpent’s eyes they will grow
again.5 And further, the tails of saurians and of serpents,
if they be cut off. will grow again.
With fishes the properties of the gut and stomach are
similar; that is, they have a stomach single and simple.

but variable in shape according to species. For in some 10
cases the stomach is gut-shaped,1 as with the scarus, or
parrot-fish ; which fish, by the way, appears to be the only
fish that chews the cud.2 And the whole length of the gut
is simple, and if it have a reduplication or kink it loosens
out again into a simple form.3
An exceptional property in fishes and in birds for the
most part is the being furnished with gut-appendages or
caeca. Birds have them low down and few in number. 15
Fishes have them high up about the stomach, and some¬
times numerous, as in the goby, the galeos,4 the perch,
the scorpaena, the citharus, the red mullet, and the sparus ;5
the cestreus or grey mullet has several of them on one
side of the belly, and on the other side only one. Some
fish possess these appendages but only in small numbers,
as the hepatus and the glaucus ; and, by the way, they are 20
few also in the dorado.6 These fishes differ also from one
another within the same species, for in the dorado one
individual has many and another few. Some fishes are
entirely without the part, as the majority of the selachians.
As for all the rest,7 some of them have a few and some
a great many. And in all cases where the gut-appendages
are found in fish, they are found close up to the stomach. 25
In regard to their internal parts birds differ from other
animals and from one another. Some birds, for instance,
have a crop in front of the stomach,8 as the barn-door cock,
the cushat, the pigeon, and the partridge ; and the crop con¬
sists of a large hollow skin, into which the food first enters

30 and where it lies undigested. Just where the crop leaves the
oesophagus it is somewhat narrow ; by and by it broadens
out, but where it communicates with the stomach it narrows
down again. The stomach (or gizzard) in most birds is
fleshy and hard, and inside is a strong skin which comes
35 away from the fleshy part. Other birds have no crop, but
instead of it an oesophagus wide and roomy, either all the
5oga way or in the part leading to the stomach, as with the daw,
the raven, and the carrion-crow. The quail also has the
oesophagus widened out at the lower extremity, and in the
aegocephalus and the owl the organ is slightly broader at
the bottom than at the top. The duck, the goose, the gull, the
catarrhactes, and the great bustard have the oesophagus wide
5 and roomy from one end to the other, and the same applies
to a great many other birds. In some birds there is a portion
of the stomach 1 that resembles a crop, as in the kestrel.
In the case of small birds like the swallow and the sparrow
neither the oesophagus nor the crop is wide, but the stomach
is long. Some few have neither a crop nor a dilated
10 oesophagus, but the latter is exceedingly long, as in long¬
necked birds, such as the porphyrio,2 and, by the way, in
the case of all these birds the excrement is unusually moist.3
The quail is exceptional in regard to these organs, as com¬
pared with other birds ; in other words, it has a crop, and
at the same time its oesophagus is wide and spacious in
15 front of the stomach, and the crop is at some distance,
relatively to its size, from the oesophagus at that part.
Further, in most birds, the gut is thin, and simple when
loosened out.4 The gut-appendages or caeca in birds, as
has been observed, are few in number, and are not situated
high up, as in fishes, but low down towards the extremity
20 of the gut. Birds, then, have caeca—not all, but the greater

duck, the night-raven, [the localus,1] the ascalaphus,2 the

of the little birds also have these appendages ; but the caeca
in their case are exceedingly minute, as in the sparrow.

 ROOK III
5oga Now that we have stated the magnitudes, the properties, I
and the relative differences of the other internal organs, it
remains for us to treat of the organs that contribute to
30 generation. These organs in the female are in all cases
internal; in the male they present numerous diversities.
In the blooded animals some males are altogether devoid
of testicles,1 and some have the organ but situated in¬
ternally ; and of those males that have the organ internally
situated, some have it close to the loin in the neighbour¬
hood of the kidney and others close to the belly. Other
35 males have the organ situated externally. In the case of
these last, the penis is in some cases attached to the belly,
5°9b whilst in others it is loosely suspended, as is the case also
with the testicles; and, in the cases where the penis is
attached to the belly, the attachment varies accordingly as
the animal is emprosthuretic or opisthuretic.
No fish is furnished with testicles, nor any other creature
that has gills, nor any serpent whatever: nor, in short, any
5 animal devoid of feet, save such only as are viviparous
within themselves.2 3 Birds are furnished with testicles, but
these are internally situated, close to the loin. The case is
similar with oviparous quadrupeds, such as the lizard, the
tortoise and the crocodile; and among the viviparous
animals this peculiarity is found in the hedgehog." Others
among those creatures that have the organ internally
situated have it close to the belly, as is the case with the

dolphin amongst animals devoid of feet, and with the io
elephant among viviparous quadrupeds.1 In other cases
these organs are externally conspicuous.
We have already2 alluded to the diversities observed in
the attachment of these organs to the belly and the
adjacent region; in other words, we have stated that in
some cases the testicles are tightly fastened back,3 as in the
pig and its allies, and that in others they are freely
suspended, as in man. 15
Fishes, then, are devoid of testicles, as has been stated,
and serpents also.4 They are furnished, however, with two
ducts connected with the midriff and running on to either
side of the backbone, coalescing into a single duct above
the outlet of the residuum, and by ‘above’ the outlet
I mean the region near to the spine. These ducts in the20
rutting season get filled with the genital fluid, and, if the
ducts be squeezed, the sperm oozes out white in colour.
As to the differences observed in male fishes of diverse
species, the reader should consult my treatise on Anatomy,5
and the subject will be hereafter more fully discussed when
we describe the specific character in each case.0
The males of oviparous animals, whether biped or quad¬
ruped, are in all cases furnished with testicles close to the 25
loin underneath the midriff. With some animals the organ
is whitish, in others somewhat of a sallow hue; in all cases
it is entirely enveloped with minute and delicate veins.
From each of the two testicles extends a duct, and, as in
the case of fishes, the two ducts coalesce into one above

The passages have been collated and discussed by Hoffner, Heitz, &c. (cf. note on iv. 1. 525a 8). It is not impossible that the treatise may still exist in an Arabic version; cf. Dschemaluddin ap.

the outlet of the residuum.1 This constitutes the penis,
30 which organ in the case of small ovipara is inconspicuous ;
but in the case of the larger ovipara, as in the goose and
the like, the organ becomes quite visible just after
copulation.
The ducts in the case of fishes and in biped and quad¬
ruped ovipara are attached to the loin under the stomach
and the gut, in betwixt them 2 and the great vein, from
which ducts or blood-vessels extend, one to each of the two
35 testicles. And just as with fishes the male sperm is found
5IC>a in the seminal ducts, and the ducts become plainly visible
at the rutting season and in some instances become in¬
visible after the season is passed, so also is it with the
testicles of birds; before the breeding season the organ is
small in some birds and quite invisible in others, but
during the season the organ in all cases is greatly enlarged.3
5 This phenomenon is remarkably illustrated in the ring-dove
and the partridge, so much so that some people are
actually of opinion that these birds are devoid of the organ
in the winter-time.
Of male animals that have their testicles placed front¬
wards, some have them inside, close to the belly, as the
dolphin; some have them outside, exposed to view, close
10 to the lower extremity of the belly. These animals re¬
semble one another thus far in respect to this organ; but
they differ from one another in this fact, that some of them
have their testicles situated separately by themselves, while
others, which have the organ situated externally, have them
enveloped in what is termed the scrotum.4
Again, in all viviparous animals furnished with feet the
following properties are observed in the testicles them¬
selves. From the aorta there extend vein-like ducts to the
15 head of each of the testicles, and another two from the
kidneys ;5 these two from the kidneys are supplied with

blood,1 while the two from the aorta are devoid of it.
From the head of the testicle alongside of the testicle
itself is a duct, thicker and more sinewy than the other
just alluded to—a duct that bends back again at the end of
the testicle2 to its head ; and from the head of each of the 20
two testicles the two ducts extend until they coalesce in
front at the penis. The duct that bends back again and
that which is in contact with the testicle are enveloped in one
and the same membrane,3 so that, until you draw aside the
membrane, they present all the appearance of being a
single undifferentiated duct. Further, the duct in contact
with the testicle has its moist content qualified by blood,
but to a comparatively less extent than in the case of the
ducts higher up which are connected with the aorta; in 25
the ducts that bend back towards the tube of the penis, the
liquid is white-coloured. There also runs a duct from
the bladder, opening into the upper part of the canal,
around which lies, sheath-wise, what is called the ‘ penis
All these descriptive particulars may be regarded by the
light of the accompanying diagram ; wherein the letter A 3°
marks the starting-point of the ducts that extend from the
aorta; the letters KK mark the heads of the testicles and
the ducts descending thereunto ; the ducts extending from
these along the testicles are marked f2f2 ; the ducts turning
back, in which is the white fluid, are marked BB ; the
penis A ; the bladder E ; and the testicles WW. 35
[By the way, when the testicles are cut off or removed,
the ducts draw upwards by contraction.4 Moreover, when 51C)b
male animals are young, their owner sometimes destroys
the organ 5 in them by attrition; sometimes they castrate
them at a later period. And I may here add, that a bull
has been known to serve a cow immediately after castration,
and actually to impregnate her.]6

So much then for the properties of testicles in male 5
animals.
In female animals furnished with a womb, the womb is
not in all cases the same in form or endowed with the same
properties, but both in the vivipara and the ovipara great
diversities present themselves. In all creatures that have
the womb close to the genitals, the womb is two-horned,
and one horn lies to the right-hand side and the other to 10
the left;1 its commencement, however, is single, and so is
the orifice, resembling in the case of the most numerous and
largest animals a tube composed of much flesh and gristle.
Of these parts one is termed the hystera or delphys, whence
is derived the word dSe\(/)6s, and the other part, the tube
or orifice, is termed metra. In all biped or quadruped 15
vivipara the womb is in all cases below the midriff,2 as in
man, the dog, the pig, the horse, and the ox ; the same is
the case also in all horned animals. At the extremity of
the so-called ceratia, or horns, the wombs of most animals
have a twist or convolution.
In the case of those ovipara that lay eggs externally, the 20
wombs are not in all cases similarly situated. Thus the
wombs of birds are close to the midriff, and the wombs of
fishes down below, just like the wombs of biped and
quadruped vivipara, only that, in the case of the fish, the
wombs are delicately formed, membranous, and elongated ;
so much so that in extremely small fish, each of the two
bifurcated parts looks like a single egg, and those fishes 25
whose egg is described as crumbling 3 would appear to have
inside them a pair of eggs, whereas in reality each of the
two sides consists not of one but of many eggs, and this
accounts for their breaking up into so many particles.
The womb of birds has the lower and tubular portion
fleshy and firm, and the part close to the midriff mem¬
branous and exceedingly thin and fine: so thin and fine 30
that the eggs might seem to be outside the womb alto¬
gether. In the larger birds the membrane is more
1 G. A. i. 3. 7i6b 32. 2 PJin. xi. 84 ‘ ova generantium annexa praecordiis ’. :i i. e. is designated a ‘ roe \


 HISTORIA ANIMALIUM
5iob
distinctly visible, and, if inflated through the tube, lifts and
swells out; in the smaller birds all these parts are more
indistinct.
The properties of the womb are similar in oviparous
35 quadrupeds, as the tortoise, the lizard, the frog and the
5iia like; for the tube below is single and fleshy, and the cleft
portion with the eggs is at the top close to the midriff.
With animals devoid of feet that are internally oviparous
and viviparous externally, as is the case with the dogfish
5 and the other so-called Selachians (and by this title we
designate such creatures destitute of feet and furnished
with gills as are viviparous), with these animals the womb
is bifurcate, and beginning down below 1 it extends as far as
the midriff, as in the case of birds. There is also a narrow
part between the two horns running up as far as the
midriff,2 and the eggs are engendered here and above at
iothe origin of the midriff; afterwards they pass into the
wider space and turn from eggs into young animals.
However, the differences in respect to the wombs of these
fishes as compared with others of their own species or with
fishes in general, would be more satisfactorily studied in
their various forms in specimens under dissection.
The members of the serpent genus also present diver¬
gencies either when compared with the above-mentioned
15 creatures or with one another. Serpents as a rule are
oviparous, the viper being the only viviparous member
of the genus.3 The viper is, previously to external partu

The subject-matter of the clause was doubtless the fact that in selachians, but not in birds, the ovaries lie between the ‘ oviducts * or horns of the uterus, and this fact is elsewhere simply and clearly stated; e.g. H.A. vi. 10. 564'’ 20

rition, oviparous internally; and owing to this peculiarity
the properties of the womb in the viper are similar to those
of the womb in the selachians. The womb of the serpent
is long, in keeping with the body, and starting below from
a single duct extends continuously on both sides of the
spine, so as to give the impression of thus being a separate 20
duct on each side of the spine, until it reaches the midriff,
where the eggs are engendered in a row ; and these eggs are
laid not one by one, but all strung together.1 [And all
animals that are viviparous both internally and externally
have the womb situated above the stomach,2 and all the
ovipara underneath, near to the loin. Animals that are
viviparous externally and internally oviparous present an 25
intermediate arrangement; for the underneath portion of
the womb, in which the eggs are, is placed near to the loin,
but the part about the orifice is above the gut.] 3
Further, there is the following diversity observable in
wombs as compared with one another: namely that the
females of horned non-ambidental animals are furnished
with cotyledons 4 in the womb when they are pregnant, and 30
such is the case, among ambidentals, with the hare, the mouse,
and the bat; whereas all other animals that are ambidental,
viviparous, and furnished with feet, have the womb quite
smooth, and in their case the attachment of the embryo
is to the womb itself and not to any cotyledon inside it.
The parts, then, in animals that are not homogeneous 35
with themselves and uniform in their texture, both parts
external and parts internal, have the properties above 5Ilb
assigned to them.

1 In sanguineous animals the homogeneous or uniform
part most universally found is the blood, and its habitat the
vein ; next in degree of universality, their analogues, lymph
and fibre, and, that which chiefly constitutes the frame of
5 animals, flesh and whatsoever in the several parts is
analogous to flesh ; then bone, and parts that are analogous
to bone, as fish-bone and gristle ; and then, again, skin,
membrane, sinew, hair, nails, and whatever corresponds to
these ; and, furthermore, fat, suet, and the excretions : and
io the excretions are dung, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile.
Now, as the nature of blood and the nature of the veins
have all the appearance of being primitive,1 2 we must discuss
their properties first of all, and all the more as some previous
writers have treated them very unsatisfactorily. And the
cause of the ignorance thus manifested is the extreme
difficulty experienced in the way of observation. For
in the dead bodies of animals the nature of the chief
15 veins is undiscoverable, owing to the fact that they collapse
at once when the blood leaves them ; for the blood pours
out of them in a stream, like liquid out of a vessel, since
there is no blood separately situated by itself, except a little
in the heart,3 but it is all lodged in the veins. In living
animals it is impossible to inspect these parts, for of their
20 very nature they are situated inside the body and out of
sight. For this reason anatomists who have carried on
their investigations on dead bodies in the dissecting-room
have failed to discover the chief roots of the veins, while
those who have narrowly inspected bodies of living men
reduced to extreme attenuation 4 have arrived at conclusions

regarding the origin of the veins from the manifestations
visible externally. Of these investigators, Syennesis, the
physician of Cyprus, writes as follows :
{ The big veins run thus 1 :—from the navel across the 25
loins,2 along the back, past the lung, in under the breasts ;
one from right to left, and the other from left to right ;
that from the left, through the liver to the kidney and the
testicle, that from the right, to the spleen and kidney and
testicle, and from thence to the penis.’
Diogenes of Apollonia 3 writes thus :— 3°
‘ The veins in man are as follows :—There are two veins
pre-eminent in magnitude. These extend through the
belly along the backbone, one to right, one to left; either
one to the leg on its own side, and upwards to the head,
past the collar bones, through the throat. From these,
veins extend all over the body, from that on the right hand 5i2a
to the right side and from that on the left hand to the left
side; the most important ones, two in number, to the heart in
the region of the backbone ; other two a little higher up
through the chest in underneath the armpit,4 each to the
hand on its own side: of these two, one being termed the vein 5
splenitis, and the other the vein hepatitis. Each of the pair
splits at its extremity ; the one branches in the direction of
the thumb and the other in the direction of the palm ; and
from these run off a number of minute veins branching off
to the fingers and to all parts of the hand. Other veins,
more minute, extend from the main veins ; from that on the 10
right towards the liver, from that on the left towards the

It is supported by Plin. xi. 89 £ venarum in umbilico nodus ac coitus ’, it is in harmony with the citation from Diogenes of Apollonia, and it is intelligible in the light of actual fact. Schneider, who adopted in his text the now commoner reading £< tov o<pda\pov Tvnpa ri]v ocPpvv, leans to the other in his Curae post. iv. p. 322. Guil. de Moerbeke is divided between the two readings, ‘ ab umbilico iuxta supercilium.’ From the point of view of embryology it is not inappropriate to call the umbilicus the origin of the veins. 3 Cf.

spleen and the kidneys.1 The veins that run to the legs2
split at the juncture 3 of the legs with the trunk and extend
right down the thigh. The largest of these4 goes down
the thigh at the back of it, and can be discerned and traced
as a big one ; the second one 5 * runs inside the thigh, not
15 quite as big as the one just mentioned. After this they pass
on along the knee to the shin and the foot (as the upper
veins were described as passing towards the hands),0 and
arrive at the sole of the foot, and from thence continue
to the toes. Moreover, many delicate veins separate off
from the great veins towards the stomach and towards
the ribs.
20 ‘The veins that run through the throat to the head" can
be discerned and traced in the neck as large ones; and
from each one of the two, where it terminates, there branch
off a number of veins to the head ; some from the right
side towards the left, and some from the left side towards
the right; and the two veins terminate near to each of the
two ears. There is another pair of veins 8 in the neck
25 running along the big vein on either side, slightly less in
size than the pair just spoken of, and with these the greater
part of the veins in the head are connected. This other
pair runs through the throat inside ; and from either one of
the two there extend veins in underneath the shoulder
blade9 and towards the hands ;10 and these appear along
30 side the veins splenitis and hepatitis as another pair of veins
smaller in size.11 When there is a pain near the surface of
the body, the physician lances12 these two latter veins;10 but
when the pain is within and in the region of the stomach

he lances the veins splenitis and hepatitis.1 And from these ,
other veins depart to run below the breasts.
‘ There is also another pair running on each side through 512
the spinal marrow to the testicles, thin and delicate. There
is, further, a pair running a little underneath the cuticle
through the flesh to the kidneys, and these with men ter¬
minate at the testicle, and with women at the womb. These 5
veins are termed the spermatic veins.2 The veins that leave
the stomach are comparatively broad just as they leave; but
they become gradually thinner, until they change over from
right to left and from left to right.
‘ Blood is thickest when it is imbibed 11 by the fleshy parts ;
when it is transmitted to the organs above-mentioned, it 10
becomes thin, warm, and frothy.’
Such are the accounts given by Syennesis and Diogenes.
Polybus 4 writes to the following effect:
4 There are four pairs of veins. The first extends from
the back of the head, through the neck on the outside, past
the backbone on either side, until it reaches the loins and 15
passes on to the legs, after which it goes on through the
shins to the outer side of the ankles and on to the feet.
And it is on this account that surgeons, for pains in the
back and loin, bleed in 5 the ham and in the outer side
of the ankle. Another pair of veins runs from the head,
past the ears, through the neck ; which veins are termed 20
the jugular veins. This pair goes on inside along the
backbone, past the muscles of the loins, on to the testicles,

2 I have transposed this clause from the end of the following sentence. For eKTrlvercu some MSS. have iyyiverm. 4 Folybus j1. Polybius, pupil and son-in-law of Hippocrates (cf. Epist. Hippocr., Kiihn, iii. p. 842, Littre, ix. p. 418). The following quotation appears in the treatise de Nat. Horn. (vi. p. 58 L, i. p. 364 K), which treatise is accordingly ascribed to Polybus (cf. K. i. p. cxlvii), and in the composite treatise de Nat. Oss. (ix. p. 174 L, i. p. 506 K), cf. Littre, ix. p. 162. The essential point is the opinion that the blood¬ vessels originate in the head (cf. Littre, i, p. 217, but see also note, infra, p. 513a 22). According to Galen (in lib. Hippocr. de nat. human, comment. xv. 11 K), P. taught the genuine doctrines of Hippocrates,

and onwards to the thighs, and through the inside of the
hams and through the shins down to the inside of the ankles
and to the feet ; and for this reason, surgeons, for pains in
25 the muscles of the loins and in the testicles, bleed on the
hams and the inner side 1 of the ankles. The third pair
extends from the temples, through the neck, in underneath
the shoulder-blades, into the lung ; those from right to left
going in underneath the breast and on to the spleen and
the kidney ; those from left to right running from the lung
30 in underneath the breast and into the liver 2 and the kidney ;
and both terminate in the fundament. The fourth pair
extend from the front part of the head and the eyes in
5i3a underneath the neck and the collar-bones ; from thence
they stretch on through the upper part of the upper arms
to the elbows 3 and then through the fore-arms on to the
wrists and the jointings of the fingers, and also through
the lower part of the upper-arms to the armpits, and so on,
5 keeping above the ribs,4 until one of the pair reaches the
spleen and the other reaches the liver ; and after this they
both pass over the stomach and terminate at the penis.’5
The above quotations sum up pretty well the statements
of all previous writers.6 Furthermore, there are some
writers on Natural History who have not ventured to lay
10 down the law in such precise terms as regards the veins, but
who all alike agree in assigning the head and the brain 7 as
the starting-point of the veins. And in this opinion they
arc mistaken.

 BOOK III. 3 5i3a
The investigation of such a subject, as has been remarked,
is one fraught with difficulties ; but, if any one be keenly
interested in the matter, his best plan will be to allow his
animals to starve to emaciation, then to strangle them on
a sudden, and thereupon to prosecute his investigations.
We now proceed to give particulars regarding the 15
properties and functions of the veins.1 There are two
blood-vessels in the thorax by the backbone, and lying to
its inner side ; and of these two the larger one is situated
to the front, and the lesser one is to the rear of it ; and the
’.arger is situated rather to the right-hand side of the body,
and the lesser one to the left; and by some this vein is 20
termed the ‘ aorta ’, from the fact that even in dead bodies
part of it is observed to be full of air.2 These blood-vessels
have their origins in the heart,3 for they traverse the other
viscera, in whatever direction they happen to run, without
in any way losing their distinctive characteristic as blood¬
vessels, whereas the heart is as it were a part of them (and
that too more in respect to the frontward and larger one of 25
the two),4 owing to the fact that these two veins are above
and below, with the heart lying midway.
The heart in all animals has cavities inside it.5 * In the
case of the smaller animals even the largest of the chambers
is scarcely discernible ; the second larger is scarcely discer¬
nible in animals of medium size; but in the largest animals 30
1 It is plain that (frXty is used indiscriminately of vein and artery, whence (not without hesitation) we translate it more often ‘ blood¬ vessel’. Only in the spurious treatise de Spiritu are the arteries distinguished as aprqpiai. They were clearly distinguished, however, by the Hippocratics. 2 The received text is meaningless.

all three chambers are distinctly seen.1 In the heart then
(with its pointed end directed frontwards, as has been
observed) the largest of the three chambers 2 is on the
right-hand side and highest up ; the least one is on the left
hand side ; and the medium-sized one lies in betwixt the
other two ; and the largest one of the three chambers is
35 a great deal larger than either of the two others.3 All

It is so far true to nature that it is clear evidence of minute inquiry, but here and there so remote from fact as to suggest that things once seen had been half-forgotten, or that superstition was in conflict with the results of observation. The account of the vessels connecting the left arm with the liver and the right with the spleen, an account embodied also in the obsolete and refuted versions of Polybus, Diogenes, and (though obscurely) even of Syennesis, is a surviving example of mystical or superstitious belief. It is possible that the ascription of three chambers to the heart was also influenced by tradition or mysticism, much in the same way as Plato’s notion of the three corporeal faculties. The whole subject is discussed and variously interpreted by Galen, Haller, Hoffmann, Philippson (vXtj dvdpanivr], p. 7), Schneider, Littre, Aubert and Wimmer, Huxley, Pouchet, Ogle, and others. A chief cause of difficulty in interpreting the whole account is the lack of precise reference to the pulmonary artery. We should have expected the two great sinewy tubes of equal size, running side by side and leading one from one and one from the other side of the heart, to have been indicated clearly above all other landmarks : but of the two great vessels connected with the heart, one is the ‘ aorta ’ and the other, the <fiXe\js peyuXrj, peyLarr], kolXtj, KoiXorarr7, is undoubtedly the vena cava ; the pulmonary artery must be included under, or indicated in con¬ nexion with, one or other of these two. We may on the one hand argue (as Huxley and others have done) that the pulmonary artery, connected as it is with the right side of the heart, was associated by A. with the veins that are likewise connected with that side; and so (51315 1) that his ‘great blood-vessel’ corre¬ sponds to the superior and inferior venae cavae together with the right auricle, that the ‘ largest chamber ’ was the right ventricle, that it was in this ventricle that the blood ‘ broadens its channel as a river widening in a lake and that the pulmonary artery was that ‘ by which the great blood-vessel comes out as blood-vessel again’. If we further accept the statement of 513^ 6, 7, that ‘ the great blood-vessel, passing through the heart, runs from the heart into the aorta ’, then (especially if we assume that it was the foetal heart which A. dis¬ sected) we may discern a reference to the ductus arteriosus, by which the pulmonary artery is connected with the aorta. This rendering brings A.’s description into close agreement with the facts, but it is nevertheless difficult to accept, and for the following reasons : (1) it is hard to suppose that A. knew or believed the venae cavae and pulmonary artery to be in so close a connexion, or was


 BOOK III. 3
three, however, are connected with passages leading in the
aware that the venous circulation of the body was continued directly through the heart into the pulmonary circulation; (2) to include the pulmonary artery in A.’s enumeration of the veins is to lose the force of his well-marked distinction between the sinewy texture of artery and the membranous texture of vein ; (3) the aorta is not ‘ much narrower’ than the pulmonary artery, but as near as may be of the same size ; (4) we are afterwards told that the aorta and its branches follow the whole course already ascribed to the veins, including therefore a distribution to the lungs ; (5) it seems to me unlikely that the ductus arteriosus was ever dissected and recognized by Aristotle. It seems to me much more likely that the pulmonary artery and aorta, both alike empty of blood in the dead subject and so similar in texture and appearance to one another and so plainly different from the veins, were together spoken of as ‘ the aorta ’, in other words as the arterial system : though this hypothesis would force us to admit that A. did not detect the simple fact of these two vessels communi¬ cating with opposite sides of the heart. This interpretation is supported
by Galen (ii. 780 K), oureo Se koi tcov dprrjpLcou rrjS KCipdlas TT€(f)vKVLO)v

According to this view, the great vein which passes through the heart and is continued again is simply the vena cava, whose inferior and superior portions meet ‘ as in a reservoir ’ in the right auricle, and are thereby attached to the right ventricle, the largest of the cavities. The part of the great vein above the heart includes the pulmonary veins (their distinctness from the superior vena cava, and their communication with another auricle, being overlooked) ; and these veins stretch away to the lung and to the point of its attachment to the artery, while the other portion, that is to say the superior vena cava itself, goes on towards the backbone and splits into the two innominate veins from which come the jugular and subclavian branches. With all this system of veins an arterial system, the pulmonary artery and the branches of the aorta, runs parallel. The big vein that Antilochus cleft, smiting Thoon in the rear, was the whole venous trunk of the superior and inferior venae cavae. The courses of the aorta and inferior vena cava in the region below the heart are related with general accuracy. In short, however we regard the account left us, there is one point of weakness, not to be reconciled with anatomical fact, the description of the heart itself and of its precise relation to the orifices of the great vessels : we may, as we please, ascribe the defect to imperfect dis¬ section, to a corrupt or mutilated text, or possibly to the persistence of archaic and traditional views in regard to this central organ. (‘ Verum aut subtilis aliquis ordinis amor magno viro imposuit, aut loca ab Apellicone interpoiata sunt, quae C. Hoffmanni est excusatio ’: Haller.)
The Hippocratics appear to have recognized, correctly, two cavities (cf. Hippocr. de Corde, i. 486 K; Galen, ii. 621, iii. 442 K ; Aristoph. Epit. ii. 21), and it was not till afterwards that the auricles were distinguished as appendages of these (cf. Galen, ii. 624 K). Galen suggests that A.’s third or middle cavity was a portion of the right-hand chamber, ev6a rrjv Tpirrjv ivdpi^ev eivat kolXIuv 6 ’ ApKTTOTeXr]?’ avrrj Se ecrriv rj Kara to tvXarv Ttjs Kapdlas popiov ovcra rrjs deltas, ovk.

direction of the lung, but all these communications are
indistinctly discernible by reason of their minuteness, except
one.1
5i3b The great blood-vessel, then, is attached to the biggest
of the three chambers, the one that lies uppermost2 and on
the right-hand side ; it then extends right through the
chamber, coming out as blood-vessel again ; just as though
the cavity of the heart were a part of the vessel, in which
the blood broadens its channel as a river that widens out

I am inclined to accept this hypothesis as a partial solution of the riddle, and to suppose that this was the middle chamber in which 7) didicpiais took place, that part of the ‘aorta’ or arterial system now known as the pulmonary artery opening into it. Plain to be seen as the aorta is elsewhere, it is concealed in the immediate neighbourhood of the heart by the pulmonary artery, which is there the most conspicuous of all vessels ; and it is undoubtedly the pulmonary artery that is referred to in Aristoph.

It is plain that the three chambers are not named or arranged here as in the other books, and also that one of the three, in this case the middle one, is recognized as being of very secondary anatomical importance. If we take, in conclusion, the account of the veins in the Hippocratic treatise de Came, 5 (viii. p. 590 L), an account closely comparable with Aristotle’s, we again find no possible opportunity to suppose that the pulmonary artery was ever associated with the venous system : dvd

We may also add that were the pulmonary artery not as naturally associated with the aorta as the arteries are easy to distinguish from the veins, the view could never have arisen that the veins sprang from the liver and the arteries from the heart (cf.

The great blood-vessel then passes through the heart
[and runs from the heart into the aorta].1 The great
vessel looks as though made of membrane or skin, while
the aorta is narrower than it, and is very sinewy ; and as it
stretches away to the head and to the lower parts it becomes 10
exceedingly narrow and sinewy.
First of all, then, upwards from the heart there stretches
a part of the great blood-vessel towards the lung and the
attachment of the aorta, a part consisting of a large
undivided vessel. But there split off from it two parts ;
one towards the lung and the other towards the backbone 15
and the last vertebra of the neck.2
The vessel, then, that extends to the lung, as the lung
itself is duplicate, divides at first into two ; and then extends
along by every pipe and every perforation, greater along
the greater ones, lesser along the less, so continuously that 20
it is impossible to discern a single part wherein there is
not perforation and vein ; for the extremities are indis¬
tinguishable from their minuteness, and in point of fact the
whole lung appears to be filled with blood. The branches
of the blood-vessels lie above the tubes that extend from
the windpipe. And that vessel3 which extends to the
vertebra of the neck and the backbone, stretches back again 25
along the backbone ; as Homer represents in the lines4:
(Antilochus, as Thoon turned him round),
Transpierc’d his back with a dishonest wound ;
The hollow vein that to the neck extends,
Along the chine, the eager javelin rends.

From this vessel there extend small blood-vessels past each
30 rib and each vertebra; and at the vertebra above the
kidneys the vessel bifurcates. And in the above way the
parts branch off from the great blood-vessel.
But up above all these, from that part which is connected
with the heart, the entire vein branches off in two directions.

though not actually choked, become insensible, shut their
eyes, and fall flat on the ground. Extending in the way
described and keeping the windpipe in betwixt them, they
pass on until they reach the ears at the junction of the
lower jaw with the skull. Hence again they branch off 10
into four veins,1 of which one 2 bends back and descends
through the neck and the shoulder,3 and meets the previous
branching off of the vein 4 at the bend of the arm, while
the rest of it terminates at the hand and fingers.
Each vein of the other5 * pair stretches from the region of 15
the ear to the brain,0 and branches off in a number of fine
and delicate veins into the so-called meninx, or membrane,
which surrounds the brain. The brain itself in all animals
is destitute of blood, and no vein, great or small, holds its
course therein. But of the remaining veins that branch off 20
from the last-mentioned vein some envelop the head, others
close their courses in the organs of sense and at the roots
of the teeth in veins exceedingly fine and minute.
4 And in like manner the parts of the lesser one of the two
chief blood-vessels, designated the aorta, branch off, accom¬
panying the branches from the big vein; only that, in 25
regard to the aorta, the passages are less in size, and the
branches very considerably less than are those of the great
vein. So much for the veins as observed in the regions
above the heart.
The part of the great vein that lies underneath the heart7
extends, freely suspended, right through the midriff, and is 30
united both to the aorta and the backbone by slack mem¬
branous communications. From it one vein, short and
1 i. e. two on each side.

wide, extends through the liver,1 and from it a number of
minute veins branch off into the liver and disappear. From
35 the vein that passes through the liver two branches separate
off, of which one2 terminates in the diaphragm or so-called
51415 midriff, and the other runs up again through the armpit
into the right arm 3 and unites with the other veins at the
inside of the bend of the arm ; and it is in consequence of
this local connexion that, when the surgeon opens this vein
in the forearm, the patient is relieved of certain pains in
the liver; and from the left-hand side of it there extends a
short but thick vein to the spleen and the little veins
5 branching off it disappear in that organ. Another part
branches off from the left-hand side of the great vein, and
ascends, by a course similar to the course recently described,
into the left arm ; 4 only that the ascending vein in the one
case is the vein that traverses 5 the liver, while in this case
it is distinct from the vein that runs into the spleen,
io Again, other veins branch off from the big vein ; one to
the omentum, and another to the pancreas, from which vein
run a number of veins through the mesentery. All these
veins coalesce in a single large vein, along the entire gut
and stomach to the oesophagus ; about these parts there
15 is a great ramification of branch veins.0
As far as the kidneys, each of the two remaining
undivided, the aorta and the big vein extend ; and here
they get more closely attached to the backbone, and branch
off, each of the two, into a A shape, and the big vein gets
20 to the rear of the aorta. But the chief attachment of the
aorta to the backbone takes place in the region of the heart;
and the attachment is effected by means of minute and
sinewy vessels. The aorta, just as it draws off from the
heart, is a tube of considerable volume, but, as it advances
1 hepatic and portal veins. 2 inferior phrenic. 3 No such vein exists, but the account is probably based on imperfect knowledge of the vena azygos, which A. would seem to have supposed to communicate with the vena basilica. 4 l’erhaps based, in like manner, on the left upper azygos. 5 Reading 17 did. ' The general distribution of the mesenteric veins is fairly correct, but Aristotle is unacquainted with their relation to the liver through the portal vein. Cf., however, //. A. vii. 9. 586b 18.


 BOOK III. 4 5Hb
in its course, it gets narrower and more sinewy. And from
the aorta there extend veins to the mesentery 1 just like the
veins that extend thither from the big vein, only that 25
the branches in the case of the aorta are considerably less
in magnitude; they are, indeed, narrow and fibrillar, and
they end in delicate hollow2 fibre-like veinlets.
There is no vessel that runs from the aorta into the liver
or the spleen.
From each of the two great blood-vessels there extend
branches to each of the two flanks,3 and both branches
fasten on to the bone. Vessels 4 also extend to the kidneys 30
from the big vein and the aorta; only that they do not
open into the cavity of the organ, but their ramifications
penetrate into its substance. From the aorta5 run two
other ducts to the bladder, firm and continuous ; and there
are other ducts from the hollow of the kidneys, in no way 35
communicating with the big vein. From the centre of each
of the two kidneys springs a hollow sinewy vein, running
along the backbone right through the loins ;G by and by 515s
each of the two veins first disappears in its own flank, and
soon afterwards reappears stretching in the direction of
the flank. The extremities of these attach to the bladder,7
and also in the male to the penis and in the female to
the womb. From the big vein no vein extends to the womb, 5
but the organ is connected with the aorta by veins numerous
and closely packed.

Furthermore, from the aorta and the great vein at the
points of divarication there branch off other veins. Some
of these run to the groins—large hollow veins1— and then
io pass on down through the legs and terminate in the feet
and toes. And, again, another set run through the groins
and the thighs cross-garter fashion, from right to left and
from left to right, and unite in the hams with the other
veins.2
Jn the above description we have thrown light upon the
course of the veins and their points of departure.
15 In all sanguineous animals the case stands as here set
forth in regard to the points of departure and the courses
of the chief veins. But the description does not hold equally
good for the entire vein-system in all these animals. For,
in point of fact, the organs are not identically situated in
them all; and, what is more, some animals are furnished
with organs of which other animals are destitute. At the
same time, while the description so far holds good, the
20 proof of its accuracy is not equally easy in all cases, but
is easiest in the case of animals of considerable magnitude
and supplied abundantly with blood. For in little animals
and those scantily supplied with blood, either from natural
and inherent causes or from a prevalence of fat in the
body, thorough accuracy in investigation is not equally
attainable ; for in the latter of these creatures the passages
get clogged, like water-channels choked with slush ;3 and
the others have a few minute fibres4 to serve instead of
25 veins. But in all cases the big vein is plainly discernible,
even in creatures of insignificant size.
The sinews of animals have the following properties. 5
For these also the point of origin is the heart5; for the
heart has sinews within itself in the largest of its three
30 chambers, and the aorta is a sinew-like vein ; in fact, at its
' The common iliacs, and their branches. 2 Probably the anastomoses of the saphenous veins. 3 Plat. Jim. 77 G ; P. A. iii. 5. 668a 14. 29; Galen, de Nat. Fac. ii. 210 K. “* uXtynf Ku'i Tuvras was. Qj'. TprjTiis, ‘ perforated.’ 0 Cf. P.A. iii. 4. 666b 17.

extremity it is actually a sinew, for it is there no longer 30
hollow, and is stretched like the sinews where they termi¬
nate at the jointings of the bones. Be it remembered,
however, that the sinews do not proceed in unbroken
sequence from one point of origin, as do the blood-vessels.
For the veins have the shape of the entire body, like
a sketch of a mannikin;1 in such a way that the whole
frame seems to be filled up with little veins2 in attenuated 5i5b
subjects—for the space occupied by flesh in fat individuals
is filled with little veins in thin ones—whereas the sinews
are distributed about the joints and the flexures of the
bones. Now, if the sinews were derived in unbroken 5
sequence from a common point of departure, this continuity
would be discernible in attenuated specimens.
In the ham, or the part of the frame brought into full
play in the effort of leaping, is an important system of
sinews; and another sinew, a double one, is that called
‘ the tendon ’,3 and others are those brought into play when
a great effort of physical strength is required; that is to
say, the epitonos or back-stay and the shoulder-sinews.4 10
Other sinews, devoid of specific designation, are situated
in the region of the flexures of the bones ; for all the bones
that are attached to one another are bound together by
sinews, and a great quantity of sinews are placed in the
neighbourhood of all the bones. Only, by the way, in the

 HISTORIA ANIMALIUM
head there is no sinew; but the head is held together by
the sutures of the bones.
15 Sinew is fissile lengthwise, but crosswise it is not easily
broken, but admits of a considerable amount of hard tension.
In connexion with sinews a liquid mucus is developed,
white and glutinous, and the organ, in fact, is sustained by
it and appears to be substantially composed of it. Now,
vein may be submitted to the actual cautery, but sinew,
when submitted to such action, shrivels up altogether ; and,
if sinews be cut asunder, the severed parts will not again
20 cohere.1 A feeling of numbness is incidental only to parts
of the frame where sinew is situated.2 3
There is a very extensive system of sinews connected
severally with the feet, the hands, the ribs, the shoulder
blades, the neck, and the arms.
All animals supplied with blood are furnished with
sinews ; but in the case of animals that have no flexures to
their limbs, but are, in fact, destitute of either feet or hands,
25 the sinews are fine and inconspicuous; and so, as might
have been anticipated, the sinews in the fish are chiefly
discernible in connexion with the fin.
The ines3 (or fibrous connective tissue) are a something 6
intermediate between sinew and vein. Some of them are
supplied with fluid, the lymph; and they pass from sinew
30 to vein and from vein to sinew.4 There is another kind of
ines or fibre that is found in blood, but not in the blood
of all animals alike. If this fibre be left in the blood, the
blood will coagulate; if it be removed or extracted, the
blood is found to be incapable of coagulation. While,
however, this fibrous matter is found in the blood of the
great majority of animals, it is not found in all. For
1 Plin. xi. 88. 2 vevpa in Ar. are sinews and ligaments, but with these he included and confused such nerves as he was acquainted with : cf. Plin. xi. 88 ‘neque ii [nervi] solidantur incisi: mirumque, vulneratis summus dolor, praesectis nullus \ 3 Cf. I\A. ii. 4. 4 The meaning is uncertain. Seal. tr. ‘diflferunt autem a nervis, quantum ad venarum naturam vergunt, et a venis distant quantum ad nervorum inclinant rationem’.


 BOOK III. 6
instance, we fail to find it in the blood of the deer,1 the roe,
the antelope,2 and some other animals ; and, owing to this
deficiency of the fibrous tissue, the blood of these animals
does not coagulate to the extent observed in the blood of
other animals.3 The blood of the deer coagulates to about 5i6a
the same extent as that of the hare: that is to say, the
blood in either case coagulates, but not into a stiff or jelly
like substance, like the blood of ordinary animals, but only
into a flaccid consistency like that of milk which is not
subjected to the action of rennet. The blood of the
antelope admits of a firmer consistency in coagulation ; for
in this respect it resembles, or only comes a little short of, 5
the blood of sheep. Such are the properties of vein, sinew,
and fibrous tissue.
The bones in animals are all connected with one single
bone,4 and are interconnected, like the veins, in one un¬
broken sequence; and there is no instance of a bone
standing apart by itself.
In all animals furnished with bones, the spine or back- 10
bone is the point of origin for the entire osseous system.
The spine is composed of vertebrae, and it extends from
the head down to the loins. The vertebrae are all per¬
forated, and, above, the bony portion of the head is
connected with the topmost vertebrae, and is designated
the ‘ skull ’. And the serrated lines on the skull are
termed ‘ sutures \
The skull is not formed alike in all animals. In some 15
animals the skull consists of one single undivided bone,
as in the case of the dog;5 in others it is composite in
structure, as in man; and in the human species the suture
is circular in the female, while in the male it is made up

of three separate sutures, uniting above in three-corner
fashion ;1 and instances have been known of a man’s skull
20 being devoid of suture altogether. The skull is composed
not of four bones, but of six; two of these are in the
region of the ears, small in comparison with the other
four. From the skull extend the jaws, constituted of bone.
[Animals in general move the lower jaw; the river
crocodile2 is the only animal that moves the upper one.] 3
25 In the jaws is the tooth-system ; and the teeth are con¬
stituted of bone, and are half-way perforated ; and the
bone in question is the only kind of bone which it is found
impossible to grave with a graving tool.
On the upper part of the course of the backbone4 are
the collar-bones and the ribs. The chest rests on ribs ; and
these ribs5 6 meet together, whereas the others do not; for
30 no animal has bone in the region of the stomach.0 Then
come the shoulder-bones, or blade-bones, and the arm
bones connected with these, and the bones in the hands
connected with the bones of the arms. With animals that
have forelegs, the osseous system of the foreleg resembles
that of the arm in man.
35 Below the level of the backbone, after the haunch-bone,
comes the hip-socket; then the leg-bones, those in the
thighs and those in the shins, which are termed colenes or
5i6b limb-bones, a part of which is the ankle, while a part of the
same is the so-called ‘ plectrum ’ in those creatures that

have an ankle;1 and connected with these bones are the
bones in the feet.
Now, with all animals that are supplied with blood and
furnished with feet, and are at the same time viviparous,
the bones do not differ greatly one from another, but only
in the way of relative hardness, softness, or magnitude. 5
A further difference, by the way, is that in one and the
same animal certain bones are supplied with marrow, while
others are destitute of it. Some animals might on casual
observation appear to have no marrow whatsoever in their
bones: as is the case with the lion,2 owing to his having
marrow only in small amount, poor and thin, and in very
few bones ; for marrow is found in his thigh and arm-bones.
The bones of the lion are exceptionally hard; so hard, in 10
fact, that if they are rubbed hard against one another they
emit spaiks like flint-stones. The dolphin has bones, and
not fish-spine.
Of the other animals supplied with blood, some differ
but little,0 as is the case with birds ,* others have systems
analogous,4 as fishes; for viviparous fishes, such as the 15
cartilaginous species, are gristle-spined,5 while the ovipara
have a spine which corresponds to the backbone in quadru¬
peds. This exceptional property has been observed in
fishes, that in some of them there are found delicate spines
scattered here and there throughout the fleshy parts. The
serpent is similarly constructed to the fish ; in other words,
his backbone is spinous.0 With oviparous quadrupeds, the 20
skeleton of the larger ones is more or less osseous ; of the

is, composed either of bone or of spine.
The other portions of the skeleton are found in some
animals and not found in others, but the presence or the
25 absence of this and that part carries with it, as a matter of
course, the presence or the absence of the bones or the
spines corresponding to this or that part. For animals
that are destitute of arms and legs cannot be furnished
with limb-bones: and in like manner with animals that
have the same parts, but yet have them unlike in form ; for
in these animals the corresponding bones differ from one
another in the way of relative excess or relative defect, or
in the way of analogy taking the place of identity. So
30 much for the osseous or spinous systems in animals.
Gristle 1 is of the same nature as bone, but differs from it 8
in the way of relative excess or relative defect. And just
like bone, cartilage also, if cut, does not grow again. In
terrestrial viviparous sanguinea the gristle formations are
35 imperforated, and there is no marrow in them as there
is in bones ; in the selachia, however—for, be it observed,
5i7a they are gristle-spined—there is found [in the case of the
flat species],2 in the region of the backbone, a gristle-like
substance analogous to bone, and in this gristle-like sub¬
stance there is a liquid resembling marrow.3 In viviparous
animals furnished with feet, gristle formations are found in
the region of the ears, in the nostrils, and around certain
5 extremities of the bones.
Furthermore, there are parts of other kinds, neither 9
identical with, nor altogether diverse from, the parts above
enumerated: such as nails, hooves, claws, and horns; and
also, by the way, beaks, such as birds are furnished with
all in the several animals that are furnished therewithal.
10 All these parts are flexible and fissile; but bone is neither
flexible nor fissile, but frangible.

And the colours of horns and nails and claw and hoof
follow the colour of the skin and the hair.1 For according
as the skin of an animal is black, or white, or of medium
hue, so are the horns, the claws, or the hooves, as the case 15
may be, of hue to match. And it is the same with nails.
The teeth, however, follow after the bones. Thus in black
men, such as the Aethiopians and the like, the teeth and
bones are white, but the nails are black, like the whole
of the skin. 20
Horns in general are hollow at their point of attachment
to the bone which juts out from the head inside the horn,
but they have a solid portion at the tip, and they are
simple and undivided in structure. In the case of the stag
alone of all animals the horns are solid throughout,2 and
ramify into branches (or antlers). And, whereas no other
animal is known to shed its horns, the deer sheds its horns 25
annually, unless it has been castrated ; and with regard to
the effects of castration in animals we shall have much to
say hereafter.3 Horns attach rather to the skin than to the
bone; which will account for the fact that there are found
in Phrygia and elsewhere cattle that can move their horns
as freely as their ears.4
Of animals furnished with nails—and, by the way, all 30
animals have nails that have toes, and toes that have feet,
except the elephantj and the elephant has toes undivided
and slightly articulated, but has no nails whatsoever5—of
animals furnished with nails, some are straight-nailed, like
man ; others are crooked-nailed, as the lion among animals 5*7b
that walk, and the eagle among animals that fly.

The following are the properties of hair and of parts io
analogous to hair, and of skin or hide. All viviparous
animals furnished with feet have hair;1 all oviparous
5 animals furnished with feet have horn-like tessellates;
fishes, and fishes only, have scales—that is, such oviparous
fishes as have the crumbling egg or roe. For of the lanky
fishes, the conger has no such egg, nor the muraena, and
the eel has no egg at all.2
The hair differs in the way of thickness and fineness,3 and
of length, according to the locality of the part in which
io it is found, and according to the quality of skin or hide on
which it grows. For, as a general rule, the thicker the
hide, the harder and the thicker is the hair; and the hair
is inclined to grow in abundance and to a great length in
localities of the bodies hollow and moist, if the localities
be fitted for the growth of hair at all. The facts are
similar in the case of animals whether coated with scales
i5 or with tessellates. With soft-haired animals the hair gets
harder with good feeding, and with hard-haired or bristly
animals it gets softer and scantier from the same cause.
Hair differs in quality also according to the relative heat
or warmth of the locality: just as the hair in man is hard in
20 warm places and soft in cold ones. Again, straight hair is
inclined to be soft, and curly hair to be bristly.
Hair is naturally fissile, and in this respect it differs in n
degree in diverse animals. In some animals the hair goes
on gradually hardening into bristle until it no longer re
35 sembles hair but spine, as in the case of the hedgehog.4
And in like manner with the nails; for in some animals
the nail differs as regards solidity in no way from bone.
Of all animals man has the most delicate skin: that
is, if we take into consideration his relative size.*’ In the
skin or hide of all animals there is a mucous liquid, scanty
in some animals and plentiful in others, as, for instance, in
30 the hide of the ox ; for men manufacture glue out of it.

 BOOK III. ii
(And, by the way, in some cases glue is manufactured from
fishes also.) The skin, when cut, is in itself devoid of
sensation ;1 and this is especially the case with the skin on
the head, owing to there being no flesh between it and the
skull. And wherever the skin is quite by itself, if it be cut 5*8a
asunder, it does not grow together again, as is seen in the
thin part of the jaw,2 in the prepuce, and the eyelid.3 In
all animals the skin is one of the parts that extends con¬
tinuous and unbroken,4 and it comes to a stop only where
the natural ducts pour out their contents,5 and at the mouth
and nails.
All sanguineous animals, then, have skin ; but not all 5
such animals have hair,6 save only under the circumstances
described above. The hair changes its colour7 as animals
grow old, and in man it turns white or grey.8 With
animals, in general, the change takes place, but not very
obviously, or not so obviously as in the case of the horse.9
Hair turns grey from the point backwards to the roots.
But, in the majority of cases, grey hairs are white from the io
beginning; and this is a proof that greyness of hair does
not, as some believe to be the case, imply withering or
decrepitude, for no part is brought into existence in a
withered or decrepit condition.
In the eruptive malady called the white-sickness all the
hairs get grey; and instances have been known where
the hair became grey while the patients were ill of the
malady, whereas the grey hairs shed off and black ones
replaced them on their recovery. [Hair is more apt to 15
turn grey when it is kept covered than when exposed
to the action of the outer air.]10 In men, the hair over the
temples is the first to turn grey,11 and the hair in the front

grows grey sooner than the hair at the back ; and the hair
on the pubes is the last to change colour.
Some hairs are congenital, others grow after the maturity
of the animal; but this occurs in man only. The congenital
20 hairs are on the head, the eyelids, and the eyebrows; of
the later growths the hairs on the pubes are the first to
come, then those under the armpits, and, thirdly, those on
the chin ; for, singularly enough, the regions where con¬
genital growths and the subsequent growths are found are
equal in number. The hair on the head grows scanty and
25 sheds out to a greater extent and sooner than all the rest.
But this remark applies only to hair in front; for no man
ever gets bald at the back of his head. Smoothness on the
top of the head is termed ‘ baldness but smoothness on
the eyebrows is denoted by a special term which means
‘ forehead-baldness ’; and neither of these conditions of
baldness supervenes in a man until he shall have come
30 under the influence of sexual passion. For no boy ever
gets bald, no woman, and no castrated man.1 In fact, if
a man be castrated before reaching puberty, the later
growths of hair never come at all; and, if the operation
take place subsequently, the after-growths, and these only,
shed off; or, rather, two of the growths shed off, but not
that on the pubes.
Women do not grow hairs on the chin ; except that a
scanty beard grows on some women after the monthly
courses have stopped ; and a similar phenomenon is observed
35 at times in priestesses in Caria,2 but these cases are looked
upon as portentous with regard to coming events. The
5i8b other after-growths are found in women, but more scanty
and sparse. Men and women are at times born consti¬
tutionally and congenitally incapable of the after-growths ;
and individuals that are destitute even of the growth upon
the pubes are constitutionally impotent.
Hair as a rule grows more or less in length as the wearer

grows in age; chiefly the hair on the head, then that in the 5
beard, and fine hair grows longest of all. With some
people as they grow old the eyebrows grow thicker,1 to
such an extent that they have to be cut off; and this
growth is owing to the fact that the eyebrows are situated
at a conjuncture of bones, and these bones, as age comes
on, draw apart and exude a gradual increase of moisture
or rheum. The eyelashes do not grow in size, but they 10
shed when the wearer comes first under the influence of
sexual feelings, and shed all the quicker as this influence
is the more powerful; and these are the last hairs to
grow grey.
Hairs if plucked out before maturity grow again ; but
they do not grow again if plucked out afterwards. Every
hair is supplied with a mucous moisture at its root, and
immediately after being plucked out it can lift light articles
if it touch them with this mucus. 15
Animals that admit of diversity of colour in the hair
admit of a similar diversity to start with in the skin and in
the cuticle of the tongue.2
In some cases among men the upper lip and the chin is
thickly covered with hair, and in other cases these parts
are smooth and the cheeks are hairy; and, by the way,
smooth-chinned men are less inclined than bearded men 20
to baldness.
The hair is inclined to grow in certain diseases, especially
in consumption, and in old age, and after death;3 and
under these circumstances the hair hardens concomitantly
with its growth, and the same duplicate phenomenon is
observable in respect of the nails.
In the case of men of strong sexual passions the con¬
genital hairs shed the sooner, while the hairs of the after- 25

growths are the quicker to come. When men are afflicted
with varicose veins 1 they are less inclined to take on bald¬
ness ; and if they be bald when they become thus afflicted,
they have a tendency to get their hair again.
If a hair be cut, it does not grow at the point of section ;
but it gets longer by growing upward from below. In
fishes the scales grow harder and thicker with age,2 and
30 when the animal gets emaciated or is growing old the
scales grow harder. In quadrupeds as they grow old the
hair in some and the wool in others gets deeper but
scantier in amount: and the hooves or claws get larger
in size; and the same is the case with the beaks of birds.
35 The claws also increase in size, as do also the nails.
5iga With regard to winged animals, such as birds, no 12
creature is liable to change of colour by reason of age,
excepting the crane.3 The wings of this bird are ash
coloured at first, but as it grows old the wings get black.
Again, owing to special climatic influences, as when un¬
usual frost prevails, a change is sometimes observed to
take place in birds whose plumage is of one uniform
5 colour;4 thus, birds that have dusky or downright black
plumage turn white or grey, as the raven, the sparrow, and
the swallow; but no case has ever yet been known of
a change of colour from white to black. [Further, most
birds change the colour of their plumage at different
seasons of the year,5 so much so that a man ignorant of
their habits might be mistaken as to their identity.]
10 Some animals change the colour of their hair with
a change in their drinking-water,0 for in some countries
the same species of animal is found white in one district
and black in another. And in regard to the commerce of
the sexes, water in many places is of such peculiar quality
that rams, if they have intercourse with the female after
drinking it, beget black lambs, as is the case with the water

of the Psychrus (so-called from its coldness), a river in the
district of Assyritis in the Chalcidic Peninsula, on the coast 15
of Thrace; and in Antandria there are two rivers of which
one makes the lambs white and the other black.1 The
river Scamander also has the reputation of making lambs
yellow, and that is the reason, they say, why Homer
designates it the ‘Yellow River’.2
Animals as a general rule have no hair on their internal 20
surfaces, and, in regard to their extremities, they have hair
on the upper, but not on the lower side.
The hare, or dasypod, is the only animal known to have
hair inside its mouth and underneath its feet.3 Further,
the so-called mouse-whale 4 instead of teeth has hairs in its
mouth resembling pigs’ bristles.
Hairs after being cut grow at the bottom but not at 25
the top; if feathers be cut off, they grow neither at top
nor bottom, but shed and fall out. Further, the bee’s wing
will not grow again after being plucked off, nor will the
wing of any creature that has undivided wings. Neither
will the sting grow again if the bee lose it, but the creature
will die of the loss.5
In all sanguineous animals membranes are found. And 30
membrane6 resembles a thin close-textured skin, but its
qualities are different, as it admits neither of cleavage nor
of extension. Membrane envelops each one of the bones
and each one of the viscera, both in the larger and the
smaller animals; though in the smaller animals the mem- S1^
branes are indiscernible from their extreme tenuity and
minuteness. The largest of all the membranes are the two
that surround the brain,7 and of these two the one that
lines the bony skull is stronger and thicker than the one
1 Antig. H.M. 78 (84); Ael. viii. 21. 2 //. xx. 74. 3 G. A. iv. 5. 774a 35 ; Plin. xi. 94. 4 Plin. xi. 62.

that envelops the brain;1 next in order of magnitude
comes the membrane that encloses the heart. If mem
5 brane be bared and cut asunder it will not grow together
again, and the bone thus stripped of its membrane
mortifies.
The omentum 2 or caul, by the way, is membrane. All 14
sanguineous animals are furnished with this organ; but in
some animals the organ is supplied with fat, and in others
it is devoid of it. The omentum has both its starting-point
10 and its attachment, with ambidental vivipara, in the centre
of the stomach, where the stomach has a kind of suture;
in non-ambidental vivipara it has its starting-point and
attachment in the chief of the ruminating stomachs.3
The bladder also is of the nature of membrane, but of 15
membrane peculiar in kind, for it is extensile. The organ
is not common to all animals, but, while it is found in all
15 the vivipara, the tortoise4 is the only oviparous animal that
is furnished therewithal. The bladder, like ordinary mem¬
brane, if cut asunder will not grow together again, unless
the section be just at the commencement of the urethra:
except indeed in very rare cases, for instances of healing
have been known to occur. After death, the organ passes
no liquid excretion ; but in life, in addition to the normal
liquid excretion, it passes at times dry excretion also,
which turns into stones in the case of sufferers from that
20 malady. Indeed, instances have been known of concretions
in the bladder so shaped as closely to resemble cockle¬
shells.
Such are the properties, then, of vein, sinew and skin, of
fibre and membrane, of hair, nail, claw and hoof, of horns,
of teeth, of beak, of gristle, of bones, and of parts that are
25 analogous to any of the parts here enumerated.

16 Flesh,1 and that which is by nature akin to it in san¬
guineous animals, is in all cases situated in between the
skin and the bone, or the substance analogous to bone; for
just as spine is a counterpart of bone, so is the flesh-like
substance of animals that are constructed on a spinous
system the counterpart of the flesh of animals constructed 30
on an osseous one.
Flesh can be divided asunder in any direction, not
lengthwise only as is the case with sinew and vein. When
animals are subjected to emaciation the flesh disappears,
and the creatures become a mass of veins and fibres ;2
when they are over fed, fat takes the place of flesh.3
Where the flesh is abundant in an animal, its veins arc 520**
somewhat small and the blood abnormally red ; the viscera
also and the stomach are diminutive ; whereas with animals
whose veins are large the blood is somewhat black, the
viscera and the stomach are large, and the flesh is some¬
what scanty. And animals with small stomachs are
disposed to take on flesh. 5
17 Again, fat and suet differ from one another.4 Suet is
frangible in all directions and congeals if subjected to
extreme cold, whereas fat can melt but cannot freeze or
congeal; and soups made of the flesh of animals supplied
with fat do not congeal or coagulate, as is found with 10
horse-flesh and pork; but soups made from the flesh of
animals supplied with suet do coagulate, as is seen with
mutton and goat’s flesh. Further, fat and suet differ as to
their localities: for fat is found between the skin and flesh,
but suet is found only at the limit of the fleshy parts.
Also, in animals supplied with fat the omentum or caul is
supplied with fat, and it is supplied with suet in animals
supplied with suet. Moreover, ambidental animals are 15
supplied with fat, and non-ambidentals with suet.
Of the viscera the liver in some animals becomes fatty,
as, among fishes, is the case with the selachia, by the

melting of whose livers an oil is manufactured. These
cartilaginous fish themselves have no free fat at all in
20 connexion with the flesh or with the stomach. The suet
in fish is fatty, and does not solidify or congeal. All
animals are furnished with fat, either intermingled with
their flesh, or apart. Such as have no free or separate fat
are less fat than others in stomach and omentum, as the
eel ; for it has only a scanty supply of suet about the
25 omentum. Most animals take on fat in the belly, especially
such animals as are little in motion.
The brains of animals supplied with fat are oily, as in
the pig ; of animals supplied with suet, parched and dry.1
But it is about the kidneys2 more than any other viscera
that animals are inclined to take on fat ; and the right
kidney is always less supplied with fat than the left kidney,
30 and, be the two kidneys ever so fat, there is always a space
devoid of fat in between the two. Animals supplied with
suet are specially apt to have it about the kidneys, and
especially the sheep ; for this animal is apt to die from its
kidneys being entirely enveloped. Fat or suet about the
kidney is superinduced by overfeeding, as is found at
520b Leontini in Sicily; and consequently in this district they
defer driving out .sheep to pasture until the day is well on,
with the view of limiting their food by curtailment of the
hours of pasture.
The part around the pupil of the eye is fatty 3 in all 18
animals, and this part resembles suet in all animals that
5 possess such a part and that are not furnished with hard
eyes.4
Fat animals, whether male or female, are more or less
unfitted for breeding purposes.5 Animals are disposed to

take on fat more when old than when young, and especially
when they have attained their full breadth and their full
length and are beginning to grow depth-ways.
19 And now to proceed to the consideration of the blood. 10
In sanguineous animals blood is the most universal and the
most indispensable part; and it is not an acquired or adven¬
titious part, but it is a consubstantial part of all animals
that are not corrupt or moribund.1 All blood is contained
in a vascular system, to wit, the veins, and is found nowhere
else, excepting in the heart. Blood is not sensitive to touch 15
in any animal,2 any more than the excretions of the stomach;
and the case is similar with the brain and the marrow.
When flesh is lacerated, blood exudes, if the animal be
alive and unless the flesh be gangrened. Blood in a healthy
condition is naturally sweet to the taste,3 and red in colour; 20
blood that deteriorates from natural decay or from disease
more or less black. Blood at its best, before it under¬
goes deterioration from either natural decay or from disease,
is neither very thick nor very thin. In the living animal it
is always liquid and warm, but, on issuing from the body,
it coagulates in all cases except in the case of the deer, the
roe, and the like animals ; for, as a general rule, blood 25
coagulates unless the fibres be extracted.4 Bull’s blood is
the quickest to coagulate.5
Animals that are internally and externally viviparous
are more abundantly supplied with blood than the san¬
guineous ovipara.6 Animals that are in good condition,
either from natural causes or from their health having been 30
attended to, have the blood neither too abundant — as
creatures just after drinking have the liquid inside them in
abundance—nor again very scanty, as is the case with

an animal gets the less becomes its supply of blood ; for
whatsoever is fat is destitute of blood.
52!a A fat substance is incorruptible, but blood and all things
containing it corrupt rapidly, and this property characterizes
especially all parts connected with the bones. Blood is
finest and purest in man ; and thickest and blackest in the
bull and the ass, of all vivipara.1 In the lower and the
5 higher parts of the body blood is thicker and blacker than
in the central parts.2
Blood beats or palpitates in the veins of all animals alike
all over their bodies, and blood is the only liquid that
permeates the entire frames of living animals, without
exception and at all times, as long as life lasts. Blood is
developed first of all in the heart of animals3 before the
io body 4 is differentiated as a whole. If blood be removed
or if it escape in any considerable quantity, animals fall
into a faint or swoon ; if it be removed or if it escape in an
exceedingly large quantity they die. If the blood get
exceedingly liquid, animals fall sick ; for the blood then
turns into something like ichor, or a liquid so thin that
it at times has been known to exude through the pores like
sweat. In some cases blood, when issuing from the veins,
15 does not coagulate at all, or only here and there. Whilst
animals are sleeping the blood is less abundantly supplied
near the exterior surfaces, so that, if the sleeping creature
be pricked with a pin, the blood does not issue as copiously
as it would if the creature were awake. Blood is developed
out of ichor by coction,and fat in like manner out of blood.
If the blood get diseased, haemorrhoids may ensue in the
nostril or at the anus, or the veins may become varicose.
20 Blood, if it corrupt in the body, has a tendency to turn
into pus, and pus may turn into a solid concretion.
Blood in the female differs from that in the male, for,
supposing the male and female to be on a par as regards
age and general health, the blood in the female is thicker
and blacker than in the male ; and with the female there is
1 Plin. xi. 90. 3 P. A. ii. 4. 666a 7, b24, &c.
2 Cf. P. A. ii. 2. 647b 34. 4 sc. of the embryo.


 BOOK III. 19
a comparative superabundance of it in the interior. Of all 25
female animals the female in man is the most richly supplied
with blood,1 and of all female animals the menstruous dis¬
charges are the most copious in woman.2 The blood of
these discharges under disease turns into flux. Apart from
the menstrual discharges, the female in the human species
is less subject to diseases of the blood than the male.
Women are seldom afflicted with varicose veins, with
haemorrhoids, or with bleeding at the nose, and, if any of 30
these maladies supervene, the menses are imperfectly
discharged.3
Blood differs in quantity and appearance according to
age; in very young animals it resembles ichor and is
abundant, in the old it is thick and black and scarce, and
in middle-aged animals its qualities are intermediate. In
old animals the blood coagulates rapidly, even blood at the 52ib
surface of the body; but this is not the case with young
animals. Ichor is, in fact, nothing else but unconcocted
blood : either blood that has not yet been concocted, or
that has become fluid again.
20 We now proceed to discuss the properties of marrow ;4
for this is one of the liquids found in certain sanguineous 5
animals. All the natural liquids of the body are contained
in vessels : as blood in veins, marrow in bones [and other
moistures in membranous structures of the skin or gut].5
In young animals the marrow is exceedingly sanguineous,
but, as animals grow old, it becomes fatty in animals supplied
with fat, and suet-like in animals with suet. All bones, 10
however, are not supplied with marrow, but only the hollow
ones, and not all of these. For of the bones in the lion
some contain no marrow at all, and some are only scantily
supplied therewith ; and that accounts, as was previously
observed,6 for the statement made by certain writers that
the lion is marrowless. In the bones of pigs it is found in 15

small quantities ; and in the bones of certain animals of this
species it is not found at all.
These liquids, then, are nearly always congenital in
animals, but milk and sperm come at a later time. Of
these latter, that which, whensoever it is present, is secreted
in all cases ready-made, is the milk ;1 sperm, on the other
20 hand, is not secreted out in all cases, but in some only, as
in the case of what are designated thori in fishes.2
Whatever animals have milk, have it in their breasts.3
All animals have breasts that are internally and externally
viviparous, as for instance all animals that have hair, as man
and the horse ; and the cetaceans, as the dolphin, the por¬
poise,4 and the whale—for these animals have breasts and
25 are supplied with milk. Animals that are oviparous or only
externally viviparous have neither breasts nor milk, as the
fish and the bird.5
All milk is composed of a watery serum called ‘ whey ’,
and a consistent substance called curd (or cheese); and the
thicker the milk, the more abundant the curd. The milk,
then, of non-ambidentals coagulates,6 and that is why cheese
30 is made of the milk of such animals under domestication ; but
the milk of ambidentals does not coagulate, nor their fat
either, and the milk is thin and sweet. Now the camel’s milk
is the thinnest, and that of the human species next after it,
and that of the ass next again, but cow’s milk is the thickest.
Milk does not coagulate under the influence of cold, but

I accept Schneider’s interpretation [Cur. post. vol. iv. p.333), ‘ Quemadmodum lac paratum et in mammis collectum adest, ita semen collectum et paratum ad coitum non adest in animalibus aut vase aliquo, velut lac mammis, continetur, praeter genus piscium in quo ol dopol qui appellantur cum mammis feminarum comparari possunt.’ Cf.

rather runs to whey ; but under the influence of heat it
coagulates and thickens.1 As a general rule milk only
comes to animals in pregnancy. When the animal is preg¬
nant milk is found, but for a while it is unfit for use,2 and
then after an interval of usefulness it becomes unfit for use
again. In the case of female animals not pregnant a small
quantity of milk has been procured by the employment of
special food, and cases have been actually known where 5
women advanced in years on being submitted to the
process of milking have produced milk, and in some cases
have produced it in sufficient quantities to enable them to
suckle an infant.
The people that live on and about Mount Oeta take
such she-goats as decline the male and rub their udders
hard with nettles to cause an irritation amounting to pain;
hereupon they milk the animals, procuring at first a liquid
resembling blood, then a liquid mixed with purulent 10
matter, and eventually milk, as freely as from females
submitting to the male.
As a general rule, milk is not found in the male of man
or of any other animal, though from time to time it has
been found in a male; for instance, once in Lemnos a
he-goat was milked by its dugs (for it has, by the way, two
dugs close to the penis), and was milked to such effect that T5
cheese was made of the produce, and the same phenomenon
was repeated in a male of its own begetting.3 Such occur¬
rences, however, are regarded as supernatural and fraught
with omen as to futurity, and in point of fact when the
Lemnian owner of the animal inquired of the oracle, the
god informed him that the portent foreshadowed the acqui¬
sition of a fortune. With some men, after puberty, milk

Plin. xxviii. 33 ‘ est autem colostra prima a partu spongiosa densitas lactis ’, also ibid. xi. 96 ; Martial, xiii. 38 ‘ Surripuit pastor quae nondum stantibus haedis, De primo matrum lacte colostra damus \ See also Colum. vii. 3 ; Antig. Mirab. 26. 3 Cf. Antig. Mirab. 26. The phenomenon has been reobserved ; cf. Beckmann in loc. Antig. ‘ Quid quod in vicinia nostra vidimus olim hircum, qui magno cum lucro quotidie mulgebatur atque dux erat et maritus caprarum ’.


 522a HISTORIA ANIMALIUM
20 can be produced by squeezing the breasts ; cases have been
known where on their being subjected to a prolonged milking
process a considerable quantity of milk has been educed.
In milk there is a fatty element, which in clotted milk
gets to resemble oil.1 Goat’s milk is mixed with sheep’s
milk in Sicily,'and wherever sheep’s milk is abundant.2
The best milk for clotting is not only that where the cheese
is most abundant, but that also where the cheese is driest.3
25 Now some animals produce not only enough milk to rear
their young, but a superfluous amount for general use, for
cheese-making and for storage. This is especially the case
with the sheep and the goat, and next in degree with the
cow. Mare’s milk, by the way, and milk of the she-ass are
mixed in with Phrygian cheese. And there is more cheese
in cow’s milk than in goat’s milk ; for graziers tell us that
30 from nine gallons of goat’s milk they can get nineteen
cheeses at an obol apiece, and from the same amount of
cow’s milk, thirty. Other animals give only enough of milk
to rear their young withal, and no superfluous amount and
none fitted for cheese-making, as is the case with all animals
522b that have more than two breasts or dugs ; for with none
of such animals is milk produced in superabundance or
used for the manufacture of cheese.
The juice of the fig and rennet4 are employed to curdle
milk. The fig-juice is first squeezed out into wool ; the
wool is then washed and rinsed, and the rinsing put into a
little milk, and if this be mixed with other milk it curdles
5 it. Rennet is a kind of milk, for it is found in the stomach
of the animal while it is yet suckling.

 BOOK III. 21 522b
21 Rennet then consists of milk with an admixture of
fire,1 which comes from the natural heat of the animal, as
the milk is concocted.2 All ruminating animals produce
rennet, and, of ambidentals, the hare.3 Rennet improves
in quality the longer it is kept ; and cow’s rennet, after io
being kept a good while, and also hare’s rennet, is good
for diarrhoea, and the best of all rennet is that of the
young deer.
In milk-producing animals the comparative amount of
the yield varies with the size of the animal and the diversi¬
ties of pasturage. For instance, there are in Phasis small
cattle that in all cases give a copious supply of milk, and 15
the large cows in Epirus 4 yield each one daily some nine 5
gallons of milk, and half of this from each pair of teats,6 and
the milker has to stand erect, stooping forward a little, as
otherwise, if he were seated, he would be unable to reach
up to the teats. But, with the exception of the ass, all the
quadrupeds in Epirus 7 are of large size, and, relatively, the 20
cattle and the dogs are the largest. Now large animals
require abundant pasture, and this country supplies just
such pasturage, and also supplies diverse pasture grounds
to suit the diverse seasons of the year. The cattle are
particularly large, and likewise the sheep of the so-called
Pyrrhic breed, the name being given in honour of King
Pyrrhus. 25
Some pasture quenches milk, as Median grass or lucerne,8
and that especially in ruminants ; other feeding renders it
copious, as cytisus and vetch ; only, by the way, cytisus in

flower is not recommended, as it has burning properties,
and vetch is not good for pregnant kine, as it causes increased
30 difficulty in parturition.1 However, beasts that have access
to good feeding, as they are benefited thereby in regard to
pregnancy, so also being well nourished produce milk in
plenty. Some of the leguminous plants 2 bring milk in
abundance, as for instance, a large feed of beans with the
ewe, the common she-goat, the cow, and the small she
523a goat; for this feeding makes them drop their udders. And,
by the way, the pointing of the udder to the ground before
parturition is a sign of there being plenty of milk a-coming.
Milk remains for a long time in the female, if she be kept
from the male and be properly fed, and, of quadrupeds, this
5 is especially true of the ewe ; for the ewe can be milked for
eight months. As a general rule, ruminating animals give
milk in abundance, and milk fitted for cheese manufacture.
In the neighbourhood of Torone cows run dry for a few
days before calving, and have milk all the rest of the time.
In women, milk of a livid colour is better than white for
10 nursing purposes ; and swarthy women give healthier milk
than fair ones. Milk that is richest in cheese is the most
nutritious, but milk with a scanty supply of cheese is the
more wholesome for children.
All sanguineous animals eject sperm.3 As to what, and 22
how, it contributes to generation, these questions will be
discussed in another treatise. Taking the size of his body
15 into account, man emits more sperm than any other animal.
In hairy-coated animals the sperm is sticky, but in other
animals it is not so. It is white in all cases, and Herodotus
is under a misapprehension when he states that the Aethio
pians eject black sperm.4

Sperm issues from the body white and consistent, if it be
healthy, and after quitting the body becomes thin and 20
black. In frosty weather it does not coagulate, but gets
exceedingly thin and watery both in colour and consistency;
but it coagulates and thickens under the influence of heat.
If it be long in the womb before issuing out, it comes more
than usually thick; and sometimes it comes out dry and
compact. Sperm capable of impregnating or of fructifica¬
tion sinks in water; sperm incapable of producing that 25
result dissolves away. But there is no truth in what
Ctesias has written about the sperm of the elephant.1

 BOOK IV
523a We have now treated, in regard to blooded animals, of
31 the parts they have in common and of the parts peculiar to
this genus or that, and of the .parts both composite and
52313 simple, whether without or within. We now proceed to
treat of animals devoid of blood. These animals are divided
into several genera.
One genus consists of so-called ‘ molluscs ’; and by the
term ‘ mollusc ’ we mean an animal that, being devoid of
blood, has its flesh-like substance outside, and any hard
structure it may happen to have, inside—in this respect
resembling the red-blooded animals,—such as the genus of
the cuttle-fish.
5 Another genus is that of the malacostraca. These are
animals that have their hard structure outside, and their
soft or flesh-like substance inside, and the hard substance
belonging to them has to be crushed rather than shattered ;
and to this genus belongs the crawfish and the crab.
A third genus is that of the ostracoderms or ‘ testaceans ’.
These are animals that have their hard substance outside
10 and their flesh-like substance within, and their hard sub¬
stance can be shattered but not crushed; and to this genus
belong the snail and the oyster.
The fourth genus is that of insects ; and this genus com¬
prehends numerous and dissimilar species. Insects are
creatures that, as the name implies, have nicks either on the
belly or on the back, or on both belly and back, and have
15 no one part distinctly osseous and no one part distinctly
fleshy, but are throughout a something intermediate between
bone and flesh; that is to say, their body is hard all
through, inside and outside. Some insects are wingless,
such as the iulus and the centipede ; some are winged, as
the bee, the cockchafer, and the wasp ; and the same kind


 BOOK IV. i 523b
is in some cases both winged and wingless,1 as the ant and 20
the glow-worm.
In molluscs 2 the external parts are as follows : in the first
place, the so-called feet; secondly, and attached to these,
the head ; thirdly, the mantle-sac, containing the internal
parts, and incorrectly designated by some writers the head ; 3
and, fourthly, fins round about the sac. In all molluscs 25
the head is found to be between the feet and the belly. All
molluscs are furnished with eight feet, and in all cases these
feet are severally furnished with a double row of suckers,
with the exception of one single species4 of poulpe or
octopus.5 The sepia, the small calamary and the large
calamary have an exceptional organ in a pair of long arms 30
or tentacles, having at their extremities a portion rendered
rough by the presence of two rows of suckers;6 and with
these arms or tentacles they apprehend their food7 and draw
it into their mouths, and in stormy weather they cling by
them to a rock and sway about in the rough water like
ships lying at anchor.8 They swim by the aid of the fins 524s
that they have about the sac. In all cases their feet are
furnished with suckers.
The octopus, by the way, uses his feelers either as feet or
hands ; with the two which stand over his mouth he draws
in food, and the last9 of his feelers he employs in the 5

Octopod is clear, but to elucidate the details of his description is not easy ; indeed Aubert is inclined to think that A. had in mind some species not studied by modern naturalists. The arm is but slightly modified in the common Octopus, typical hectocotylization being only found in Argonauta, Tremoctopus, and Philonexis. In these (and to one or other of them I take the description to refer) the arm, when freed from a special sac in which it is at first contained, has a long hollow terminal filament (the ‘ penis1 of modern nomenclature, by which the spermatophores are transmitted), and at its base another sac, or the remains thereof, within which the filament had developed.

in the act of receiving food by the mouth.1 They can shift
the tube from side to side, and by means of it they discharge
the black liquid peculiar to the animal.
Stretching out its feet, it swims 2 obliquely in the direc¬
tion of the so-called head,3 and by this mode of swimming
15 it can see in front, for its eyes are at the top, and in this
attitude it has its mouth at the rear. The ‘ head while
the creature is alive, is hard, and looks as though it were
inflated.4 It apprehends and retains objects by means
of the under-surface of its arms, and the membrane in
between its feet is kept at full tension; if the animal get
on to the sand it can no longer retain its hold.
20 There is a difference between the octopus and the other
molluscs above mentioned : 5 the body of the octopus is
small, and his feet are long, whereas in the others the body
is large and the feet short ; so short, in fact, that they
cannot walk on them. Compared with one another, the
teuthis, or calamary, is long-shaped,6 and the sepia flat
25 shaped ; and of the calamaries the so-called teuthus is much

I feel certain that Aubert is far astray in identifying the latter with Sepioteuthis, a small animal of excessive rarity. Leaving out Sepia and Octopus, we have two sorts of cuttlefish conspicuous and abundant in the markets of the Mediterranean, viz. Loligo vulgaris and its immediate allies, and the various species of Ommastrephini ; of these latter, one very com¬ mon species, Todarodes sagittatus (totaro of the Naples fishermen), grows to an immense size. I think that reidos was Todarodes and its allies, t(v6ls Loligo. In the former the fins are united to form a broad arrow-shaped, sometimes almost circular, fin stretching right across the body (hence calatuaio sactta of the Italians) ; in the latter the fin is longer and divided into two lateral halves, not meeting across the middle line nor forming one circular fin right across the body : <171-0 peaov

two ells, and the feelers of the octopus are sometimes
as long, or even longer. The species teuthus is not
a numerous one ; the teuthus differs from the teuthis in
shape ; that is, the sharp extremity of the teuthus is broader 30
than that of the other, and, further, the encircling fin goes
all round the trunk, whereas it is in part lacking in the
teuthis ; both animals are pelagic.
In all cases the head comes after the feet, in the middle
of the feet that are called arms or feelers. There is here 52415
situated1 a mouth, and two teeth 2 in the mouth ; and
above these two large eyes, and betwixt the eyes a small
cartilage enclosing a small brain ; and within the mouth
it has a minute organ of a fleshy nature, and this it uses
as a tongue, for no other tongue does it possess. Next 5
after this, on the outside, is what looks like a sac; the flesh
of which it is made is divisible, not in long straight strips,
but in annular flakes; and all molluscs have a cuticle
around this flesh.3 Next after or at the back of the mouth
comes a long and narrow oesophagus, and close after that
a crop or craw, large and spherical,4 like that of a bird; 10

In P.A. iv. 5. 678b we read that the alimentary canal is alike in Sepia and Octopus, but in the TevOiSes the two stomach-cavities resemble one another, and the one is not so like to a crop ; this is accurately true of Loligo, whereas the forms which I am inclined to identify with revdos, unfortunately not mentioned in this passage, resemble Sepia and Octopus; cf. Cuvier, Mem. sur les Mollusques, Cefthalopodes, p. 52 ‘Celui-ci (le deuxi^me estomac) ou ce que nous avons appele aussi le coecum, est ramasse en une double et courte spirale dans le calmar sagitte (Todarodes); mais dans le calmar commun (Loligo), il forme un long sac a parois minces, qui descend jusques dans le fond de l’abdomen, et oil Ton ne voit de vestige de courbure et de sillons transverses que vers son origine. Le gezier est, comme dans la seiche, charnu et double d’une veloutee presque cornee.’ An Aristotelian fragment in Athen. vii. p. 326 gives no further help.

then comes the stomach, like the fourth stomach in rumi¬

discharge such a juice, but the discharge is most copious
in the cuttle-fish. The mytis, then, is situated under the
mouth, and the oesophagus runs through it ; and down
below at the point to which the gut extends 1 is the vesicle
of the black juice, and the animal has the vesicle and the
gut enveloped in one and the same membrane, and by 20
the same orifice discharges both the black juice and the
residuum. The animals have also certain hair-like or furry
growths in their bodies.2
In the sepia, the teuthis, and the teuthus the hard
parts are within, towards the back of the body ; those parts
are called in one the sepium, and in the other the ‘ sword \3
They differ from one another, for the sepium in the cuttle¬
fish and teuthus is hard and flat, being a substance inter- 25
mediate between bone and fish-bone, with (in part) a
crumbling, spongy texture, but in the teuthis the part is
thin and somewhat gristly. These parts differ from one
another in shape, as do also the bodies of the animals.
The octopus has nothing hard of this kind in its interior,
but it has a gristly substance round the head, which, if the
animal grows old, becomes hard.4 30
The females differ from the males. The males have
a duct in under the oesophagus, extending from the
mantle-cavity5 to the lower portion of the sac, and there
is an organ to which it attaches, resembling a breast; in
the female there are two of these organs, situated higher 525**
up; with both sexes there are underneath these organs
certain red formations. The egg6 of the octopus is single,
uneven on its surface, and of large size ; the fluid substance
within is all uniform in colour, smooth, and in colour white ;
the size of the egg6 is so great as to fill a vessel larger than 5
1 sc. before turning back. 2 That these are the gills is rendered more than probable by H.A. iv. 4. 529a 30, ix. 37. 62ob 17, where the gills of the scallop and the crawfish are described under the same name or epithet. 3 P.

close to the surface, and is the largest of them all, and near
the shore the size is larger than in deep water ; and there 15
are others, small, variegated in colour, which are not articles
of food. There are two others,1 one called the heledone,

molluscs having two,—and the other nicknamed variously

a separate valve of a deep scallop-shell.3 This polypus
lives very often near to the shore, and is apt to be thrown

it is found with its shell detached, and dies4 by and by on

the first, is that of the lobster ; the lobster differing from
the crawfish 1 in having claws, and in a few other respects
as well. Another species is that of the carid, and another
is that of the crab, and there are many kinds both of
carid and of crab. 525
Of carids there are the so-called cyphae, or ‘ hunch-backs ’y
the crangons, or squillae, and the little kind, or shrimps,3
and the little kind do not develop into a larger kind.
Of the crab, the varieties are indefinite and incalculable.
The largest of all crabs is one nicknamed Maia,4 a second
variety is the pagunis5 6 and the crab of Heracleotis, and 5
a third variety is the fresh-water crab;G the other varieties
are smaller in size and destitute of special designations. In
the neighbourhood of Phoenice there are found on the
beach certain crabs that are nicknamed the ‘horsemen’,7
from their running with such speed that it is difficult to
overtake them ; these crabs, when opened, are usually
found empty, and this emptiness may be put down to
insufficiency of nutriment. [There is another variety, small 10
like the crab, but resembling in shape the lobster.] 8
All these animals, as has been stated, have their hard and
shelly part outside, where the skin is in other animals, and
the fleshy part inside ; and the belly is more or less
provided with lamellae, or little flaps, and the female here
deposits her spawn.

15 The crawfishes have five feet on either side, including
the claws at the end ;1 and in like manner the crabs have
ten feet in all, including the claws. Of the carids, the
hunch-backed, or prawns, have five feet on either side,
which are sharp-pointed—those towards the head; and five
others on either side in the region of the belly, with their
20 extremities flat ; they are devoid of flaps on the under side
such as the crawfish has, but on the back they resemble
the crawfish.2 It is very different with the crangon, or

the belly-fins in the female are large and overlapping on the
neck,1 while in the male they are smaller and do not over¬
lap ;2 and, further, on the last feet of the male there are
5 spur-like projections, large and sharp, which projections in
the female are small and smooth. Both male and female
have two antennae in front of the eyes, large and rough,
and other antennae underneath, small and smooth. The
eyes of all these creatures are hard and beady,3 and can
10 move either to the inner or to the outer side. The eyes of
most crabs have a similar facility of movement, or rather,
in the crab this facility is developed in a higher degree.
The lobster 4 is all over grey-coloured, with a mottling of
black. Its under or hinder feet, up to the big feet or claws,
are eight in number; then come the big feet, far larger 5
and flatter at the tips than the same organs in the craw
15 fish; and these big feet or claws are exceptional in their
structure, for the right claw has the extreme flat surface
long and thin, while the left claw has the corresponding
surface thick and round.6 Each of the two claws, divided
at the end like a pair of jaws, has both below and above a set
of teeth: only that in the right claw they are all small and
saw-shaped, while in the left claw those at the apex are
20 saw-shaped and those within are molar-shaped, these latter
being, in the under part of the cleft claw, four teeth close
together, and in the upper part three teeth, not close
together. Both right and left claws have the upper part
mobile, and bring it to bear against the lower one, and
tinction alluded to in the foremost legs or great claws. It is not unnatural to reckon the legs in order from behind forwards when the animal is viewed from below, that is to say, in the direction in which they overlap. 1 i.e. the narrow part of the abdomen.

both are curved like bandy-legs, being thereby naturally
adapted for apprehension and constriction. Above the two 2 5
large claws come two others,1 covered with hair, a little
underneath the mouth; and underneath these the gill-like
formations in the region of the mouth, hairy and numerous.2
These organs the animal keeps in perpetual motion; and
the two hairy feet it bends and draws in 3 towards its mouth.
The feet near the mouth are furnished also with delicate
outgrowing appendages.4 Like the crawfish, the lobster 30
has two teeth, or mandibles, and above these teeth are its
antennae, long, but shorter and finer by far than those of
the crawfish, and then four other antennae5 similar in
shape, but shorter and finer than the others. Over these 526b
antennae come the eyes, small and short,6 not large like the
eyes of the crawfish. Over the eyes is a peaky rough
projection like a forehead,7 larger than the same part in
the crawfish ; in fact, the frontal part is more pointed and
the thorax is much broader in the lobster than in the craw- 5
fish, and the body in general is smoother and more full of
flesh. Of the eight feet, four are bifurcate at the extremi¬
ties, and four are undivided. The region of the so-called
neck is outwardly divided into five divisions, and sixthly
comes the flattened portion at the end, and this portion
has five flaps, or tail-fins ; and the inner or under parts, JO
into which the female drops her spawn,8 are four in number
and hairy, and on each of the aforesaid parts is a spine
turned outwards, short and straight. The body in general
and the region of the thorax in particular are smooth, not
rough as in the crawfish;9 but on the large claws the
outer portion has larger spines. There is no apparent 15
difference between the male and female, for they both have
1 i.e. the third maxillipeds.

one claw, whichever it may be, larger than the other, and
neither male nor female is ever found with both claws of
the same size.1
2 All crustaceans take in water close by the mouth. The
crab discharges it, closing up, as it does so, a small portion
20 of the same,3 and the crawfish discharges it by way of the
gills ; and, by the way, the gill-shaped organs in the craw¬
fish are very numerous.
The following properties are common to all crustaceans :
they have in all cases two teeth, or mandibles (for the front
teeth in the crawfish are two in number), and in all cases
there is in the mouth a small fleshy structure serving for
a tongue ;4 and the stomach is close to the mouth, only that
25 the crawfish has a little oesophagus in front of the stomach,
and there is a straight gut attached to it. This gut, in the
crawfish and its congeners, and in the carids, extends in a
straight line to the tail, and terminates where the animal
discharges the residuum, and where the female deposits5 6 her
spawn ; in the crab it terminates where the flap is situated,
and in the centre of the flap. [And, by the way, in all
3° these animals the spawn is deposited outside.] 0 Further,
the female has the place for the spawn running along the
gut. And, again, all these animals have, more or less, an
organ termed the ‘ mytis ’, or ‘ poppy-juice ’.
We must now proceed to review their several differen¬
tiae.
527a The crawfish then, as has been said, has two teeth, large
and hollow, in which is contained a juice resembling the
mytis, and in between the teeth is a fleshy substance,
shaped like a tongue. After the mouth comes a short
oesophagus, and then a membranous stomach attached to

the oesophagus, and at the orifice of the stomach are three
teeth, two facing one another and a third standing by itself
underneath. Coming off at a bend from the stomach is
a gut, simple and of equal thickness throughout the entire
length of the body until it reaches the anal vent.
These are all common properties of the crawfish, the
carid, and the crab ; for the crab, be it remembered, has
two teeth.1
Again, the crawfish has a duct attached all the way from
the chest to the anal vent;2 and this duct is connected
with the ovary in the female, and with the seminal ducts in
the male. This passage is attached to the concave surface
of the flesh in such a way that the flesh is in betwixt the
duct and the gut; for the gut is related to the convexity
and this duct to the concavity, pretty much as is observed
in quadrupeds. And the duct is identical in both the sexes;
that is to say, the duct in both is thin and white, and charged
with a sallow-coloured moisture, and is attached to the
chest.
[The following are the properties of the egg and of the
convolutes in the carid.] 3
The male, by the way, differs from the female in regard
to its flesh, in having in connexion with the chest two
separate and distinct white substances, resembling in colour
and conformation the tentacles of the cuttle-fish, and they
are convoluted like the £poppy' or quasi-liver of the
trumpet-shell. These organs have their starting-point in
‘ cotyledons ’ or papillae, which are situated under the
hindmost feet; and hereabouts the flesh is red and blood
coloured, but is slippery to the touch and in so far unlike
flesh. Off from the convolute 4 organ at the chest branches

off another coil about as thick as ordinary twine ; and
underneath there are two granular seminal bodies in juxta
position with the gut. These are the organs of the male.
The female has red-coloured eggs, which are adjacent to
the stomach and to each side of the gut all along to
the fleshy parts, being enveloped in a thin membrane.

 BOOK IV. 3 527
With regard to the crab, it has already been stated that 5
it has claws and feet, and their position has been set forth ;
furthermore, for the most part they have the right claw
bigger and stronger than the left. It has also been stated1
that in general the eyes of the crab look sideways. Further,
the trunk of the crab’s body is single and undivided, includ¬
ing its head 2 * and any other part it may possess. Some 10
crabs have eyes placed sideways on the upper part,
immediately under the back, and standing a long way
apart, and some have their eyes in the centre and close
together, like the crabs of Heracleotis and the so-called
‘ grannies V5 The mouth lies underneath the eyes, and
inside it there are two teeth, as is the case with the
crawfish, only that in the crab the teeth are not rounded
but long ; and over the teeth are two lids,4 and in betwixt 15
them are structures such as the crawfish has besides its
teeth. The crab takes in water near by the mouth, using
the lids as a check to the inflow,5 and discharges the water
by two passages above the mouth, closing by means of the
lids the way by which it entered ; and the two passage-ways
are just underneath the eyes. When it has taken in water 20
it closes its mouth by means of both lids, and ejects the
water in the way above described.6 Next after the teeth
comes the oesophagus, very short, so short in fact that the
stomach seems to come straightway after the mouth. Next
after the oesophagus comes the stomach, two-horned, to
the centre of which is attached a simple and delicate gut; 25
and the gut terminates outwards, at the 7 operculum, as
has been previously stated. [The crab has the parts in

According to Cavolini the water does enter by these anterior apertures, as well as at the sides of the carapace. Schn. and Picc. delete the last clause, Ka\ orav . . .

between the lids in the neighbourhood of the teeth similar
to the same parts in the crawfish.] Inside the trunk is
a sallow juice and some few little bodies, long and white,
30 and others spotted red.1 The male differs from the female
in size and breadth, and in respect of the ventral flap ;2 for
this is larger in the female than in the male, and stands out
further from the trunk, and is more hairy3 [as is the case
also with the female in the crawfish].
So much, then, for the organs of the malacostraca or
Crustacea.
With the ostracoderma, or testaceans,4 such as the land- 4
528s snails and the sea-snails, and all the { oysters ’ so-called,
and also with the sea-urchin genus, the fleshy part, in such
as have flesh, is similarly situated to the fleshy part in the
crustaceans; in other words, it is inside the animal, and
the shell is outside, and there is no hard substance in the
interior. As compared with one another the testaceans
5 present many diversities, both in regard to their shells and
to the flesh within. Some of them have no flesh at all, as
the sea-urchin ; others have flesh, but it is inside and wholly
hidden, except the head, as in the land-snails,5 * 7 and the so
called cocalia,° and, among pelagic animals, in the purple
10 murex, the ceryx or trumpet-shell,” the sea-snail, and the

spiral-shaped 1 testaceans in general. Of the rest, some are
bivalved and some univalved ; and by ‘ bivalves 5 I mean such
as are enclosed within two shells, and by ‘ univalved ’ such as
are enclosed within a single shell, and in these last the
fleshy part is exposed, as in the case of the limpet.2 Of the
bivalves, some can open out, like the scallop and the mussel ; 15
for all such shells are grown together on one side and are
separate on the other, so as to open and shut.8 Other
bivalves are closed on both sides alike, like the solen
or razor-fish.4 Some testaceans there are, that are entirely
enveloped in shell and expose no portion of their flesh
outside, as the tethya or ascidians. 20
Again, in regard to the shells themselves, the testaceans
present differences when compared with one another.5 Some
are smooth-shelled, like the solen, the mussel, and some
clams,5 viz. those that are nicknamed 4 milk-shells ’,7 while
others are rough-shelled, such as the pool-oyster or edible
oyster, the pinna, and certain species of cockles, and the
trumpet-shells; and of these some are ribbed,8 such as
the scallop and a certain kind of clam or cockle, and some 25
are devoid of ribs, as the pinna and another species of
clam. Testaceans also differ from one another in regard

to the thickness or thinness of their shell, both as regards
the shell in its entirety and as regards specific parts of the
shell, for instance, the lips ; for some have thin-lipped
shells, like the mussel, and others have thick-lipped shells,
like the oyster. A property common to the above men¬
tioned, and, in fact, to all testaceans, is the smoothness
30 of their shells inside.1 Some also are capable of motion,
like the scallop, and indeed some aver that scallops can
actually fly, owing to the circumstance that they often
jump right out of the apparatus by means of which they
are caught;2 others are incapable of motion and are
attached fast to some external object, as is the case with
the pinna.3 All the spiral-shaped testaceans can move
528b and creep, and even the limpet4 relaxes its hold to go in
quest of food. In the case of the univalves and the bi¬
valves, the fleshy substance adheres to the shell so tena¬
ciously that it can only be removed by an effort; in the
5 case of the stromboids, it is more loosely attached. And
a peculiarity of all the stromboids is the spiral twist of the
shell in the part farthest away from the head; they are
also furnished from birth with an operculum. And, further,
all stromboid testaceans have their shells on the right-hand
side, and move not in the direction of the spire, but the
10 opposite way.5 Such are the diversities observed in the
external parts of these animals.
The internal structure is almost the same in all these
creatures, and in the stromboids especially; for it is in size
that these latter differ from one another, and in accidents
of the nature of excess or defect. And there is not much
difference between most of the univalves and bivalves;
15 but, while those that open and shut differ from one another

It seems simply to mean that the movement must start from the right, and that therefore the shell must be assumed to be to the right-hand side since the animal is found to move in a direction opposite to the spire. Cf. de Inc. 5* 7°6;l 12, from which the passage is perhaps derived (A. and \V.).


 BOOK IV. 4 528b
but slightly, they differ considerably from such as are
incapable of motion. And this will be illustrated more
satisfactorily hereafter.
The spiral-shaped testaceans are all similarly constructed,
but differ from one another, as has been said, in the way
of excess or defect (for the larger species have larger and
more conspicuous organs, and the smaller have smaller 20
and less conspicuous), and, furthermore, in relative hardness
or softness, and in other such accidents or properties.
All the stromboids, for instance, have the flesh that extrudes
from the mouth of the shell, hard and stiff; some more,
and some less. From the middle of this protrudes the
head and two horns, and these horns are large in the large
species, but exceedingly minute in the smaller ones. The 25
head protrudes from them all in the same way; and, if
the animal be alarmed, the head draws in again. Some
of these creatures have a mouth and teeth,1 as the snail;
teeth sharp, and small, and delicate. They have also a pro¬
boscis just like that of the fly; and the proboscis is tongue¬
shaped. The ceryx and the purple murex have this organ 3°
firm and solid; and just as 2 the myops, or horse-fly, and
the oestrus, or gadfly, can pierce the skin of a quadruped,
so is this proboscis proportionately stronger in these testa¬
ceans ; for they bore right through the shells of other
shell-fish on which they prey.3 The stomach follows close 52ga
upon the mouth, and, by the way, this organ in the snail
resembles a bird’s crop.4 Underneath come two white firm
formations, mastoid or papillary in form ; and similar
formations are found in the cuttle-fish also, only that they
are of a firmer consistency in the cuttle-fish. After the
stomach comes an oesophagus, simple and long, extend- 5
ing to the poppy or quasi-liver, which is in the innermost
recess of the shell. All these statements may be verified
in the case of the purple murex and the ceryx by observa

tion within the whorl of the shell. What comes next to
the oesophagus is the gut ; in fact, the gut is continuous
with the oesophagus,1 and runs its whole length uncom¬
plicated to the outlet of the residuum. The gut has its
io point of origin in the region of the coil of the mecon, or
so-called ‘ poppy \ and is wider hereabouts [for, remember,
the mecon is for the most part a sort of excretion in all
testaceans] ; it then takes a bend and runs up again
towards the fleshy part, and terminates by the side of the
head, where the animal discharges its residuum ; and this
holds good in the case of all stromboid testaceans, whether
15 terrestrial or marine. From the stomach there is drawn in
a parallel direction with the oesophagus, in the larger snails,
a long white duct2 enveloped in a membrane, resembling
in colour the mastoid formations higher up ; and in it are
nicks or interruptions, as in the egg-mass of the crawfish,
only, by the way, the duct of which we are treating is white
20 and the egg-mass of the crawfish is red. This formation
has no outlet nor duct, but is enveloped in a thin membrane
with a narrow cavity in its interior. And from the gut
downward extend black and rough formations, in close
connexion, something like the formations in the tortoise,
only not so black. Marine snails, also, have these forma¬
tions, and the white ones, only that the formations are
25 smaller in the smaller species.
The non-spiral univalves and bivalves are in some
respects similar in construction, and in some respects
dissimilar, to the spiral testaceans. They all have a head
and horns, and a mouth, and the organ resembling a
tongue ; but these organs, in the smaller species, are indis¬
cernible owing to the minuteness of these animals, and
some are indiscernible even in the larger species when
dead, or when at rest and motionless. They all have the
30 mecon, or poppy, but not all in the same place, nor of
equal size, nor similarly open to observation; thus, the
limpets have this organ deep down in the bottom of the
shell, and the bivalves at the hinge connecting the two
1 A. and W. and Dittm. bracket this clause. The ‘ hermaphrodite duct ’.


 BOOK IV. 4 529a
valves.1 They also have in all cases the hairy growths
or beards,2 in a circular form, as in the scallops. And,
with regard to the so-called ‘egg’,3 in those that have 52gb
it, when they have it, it is situated in one of the semi¬
circles of the periphery, as is the case with the white
formation in the snail; for this white formation in the
snail corresponds to the so-called egg of which we are
speaking. But all these organs, as has been stated, are 5
distinctly traceable in the larger species, while in the small
ones they are in some cases almost, and in others altogether,
indiscernible. Hence they are most plainly visible in the
large scallops ; and these are the bivalves that have one
valve flat-shaped, like the lid of a pot. The outlet of the
excretion is in all these animals (save for the exception to
be afterwards related)4 on one side ; for there is a passage
whereby the excretion passes out. [And, remember, the 10
mecon or poppy, as has been stated, is an excretion in all
these animals—an excretion enveloped in a membrane.]5 *
The so-called egg has no outlet in any of these creatures,
but is merely an excrescence in the fleshy mass; and it is
not situated in the same region with the gut, but the 4 egg ’
is situated on the right-hand side, and the gut on the left.0
Such are the relations of the anal vent in most of these
animals ; but in the case of the wild7 limpet (called by some 15
the 4 sea-earthe residuum issues beneath8 the shell, for
the shell is perforated to give an outlet. In this particular
limpet the stomach is seen coming after the mouth, and the

egg-shaped formations are discernible. But for the relative
positions of these parts you are referred to my Treatise on
Anatomy.
20 The so-called 1 carcinium or hermit crab is in a way
intermediate between the crustaceans and the testaceans.
In its nature it resembles the crawfish kind, and it is born
simple of itself.1 2 but by its habit of introducing itself into
a shell and living there it resembles the testaceans, and so
appears to partake of the characters of both kinds. In
25 shape, to give a simple illustration, it resembles a spider,
only that the part below the head and thorax is larger in
this creature than in the spider. It has two thin red horns,
and underneath these horns two long eyes, not retreating
inwards, nor turning sideways like the eyes of the crab, but
protruding straight out ; and underneath these eyes the
30 mouth, and round about the mouth several hair-like
growths, and next after these two bifurcate legs or claws,
whereby it draws in objects towards itself, and two other
legs on either side, and a third 3 4 small one. All below the
530a thorax is soft, and when opened in dissection is found to be
sallow-coloured within. From the mouth there runs a single
passage right on to the stomach, but the passage for the
excretions is not discernible. The legs and the thorax are
hard, but not so hard as the legs and the thorax of the
5 crab. It does not adhere to its shell like the purple murex
and the ceryx, but can easily slip out of it. It is longer
when found in the shell of the stromboids than when found
in the shell of the neritae.
4 And, by the way, the animal found in the shell of the
neritae is a separate species, like to the other in most
respects ; but of its bifurcate feet or claws, the right-hand
one is small and the left-hand one is large/’ and it pro
10 gresses chiefly by the aid of this latter and larger one.

[In the shells of these animals,1 and in certain others,2
there is found a parasite whose mode of attachment is
similar. The particular one which we have just described
is named the cyllams.] :3
The nerites has a smooth large round shell,4 and resembles
the ceryx in shape, only the poppy-juice is, in its case, not
black but red. It clings with great force near the middle.' 15
In calm weather, then, they go free afield, but when the
wind blows the carcinia take shelter against the rocks :
the neritae themselves cling fast like limpets and the same
is the case with the haemorrhoid7 or aporrhaid and all
others of the like kind. And, by the way, they cling to 20
the rock, when they turn back their operculum, for this
operculum seems like a lid ; in fact this structure repre¬
sents the one part, in the stromboids, of that which in the

is fleshy, and the mouth is inside. And it is the same
with the haemorrhoid, the purple murex, and all suchlike 35
animals.
Such of the little crabs as have the left foot or claw the
bigger of the two are found in the neritae, but not in
the stromboids. [There are some snail-shells which have
inside them creatures resembling those little crayfish that
are also found in fresh water. These creatures, however,
differ in having the part inside the shell soft.]'* But as 30

to their characters, you are referred to my Treatise on
Anatomy.
1 The urchins are devoid of flesh, and this is a character 5
peculiar to them ; and while they are in all cases empty
and devoid of any flesh within,2 they are in all cases fur¬
nished with the black formations. There are several species
53°b of the urchin, and one of these is that which is made use of
for food ;:J this is the kind in which are found the so-called
eggs,4 large and edible, in the larger and smaller specimens
alike; for even when as yet very small they are provided
with them. There are two other species, the spatangus,5
5 and the so-called bryssus;G these animals are pelagic and
scarce. Further, there are the echinometrae, or ‘mother
urchins the largest in size of all the species.7 In addition
to these there is another species, small in size, but furnished
with large hard spines; it lives in the sea at a depth of
several fathoms;8 and is used by some people as a specific
io for cases of strangury.9 In the neighbourhood of Torone 10
there are sea-urchins of a white colour, shells, spines, eggs
and all, and that are longer than the ordinary sea-urchin.
The spine in this species is not large nor strong, but rather
limp; and the black formations in connexion with the mouth
are more than usually numerous, and communicate with
15 the external duct, but not with one another; in point of

fact, the animal is in a manner divided up by them. The
edible urchin moves with greatest freedom and most often ;
and this is indicated by the fact that these urchins have
always something or other 1 on their spines.
All urchins are supplied with eggs, but in some of the
species the eggs are exceedingly small and unfit for food.
Singularly enough, the urchin has what we may call its head
and its mouth down below, and a place for the issue of the -o
residuum up above ; [and this same property is common to
all stromboids and to limpets].2 For the food on which
the creature lives lies down below; consequently the mouth
has a position well adapted for getting at the food, and the
excretion is above, near to the back of the shell. The
urchin has, also, five hollow teeth inside, and in the middle
of these teeth a fleshy substance serving the office of a 25
tongue. Next to this comes the oesophagus, and then the
stomach, divided into five parts, and filled with excretion,3
all the five parts uniting at the anal vent, where the shell
is perforated for an outlet. Underneath the stomach, in
another membrane, are the so-called eggs, identical in
number in all cases, and that number is always an odd s°
number, to wit five. Up above, the black formations4 are
attached to the starting-point of the teeth, and they are
bitter to the taste, and unfit for food. A similar or at least
an analogous formation is found in many animals ; as, for
instance, in the tortoise, the toad, the frog, the stromboids,
and, generally, in the molluscs ; but the formation varies 531*
here and there in colour, and in all cases is altogether uneat¬
able, or more or less unpalatable. In reality the mouth
apparatus 5 of the urchin is continuous from one end to the

Gaza, ‘cuius rei argumentum quod semper aliquid algae suis spinis implexum gerant.’ On the other hand, Plin. ix. 51 reads: ‘ingredi est his in orbem volvi ; itaque detritis saepe aculeis inveniuntur.’ This suggests to me that some such word as rpvxovaiv underlies ti

other, but to outward appearance it is not so, but looks like
5 a horn lantern 1 with the panes of horn left out. The urchin
uses its spines as feet; for it rests its weight on these, and
then moving shifts from place to place.
The so-called tethyum orascidian2 has of all these animals
the most remarkable characteristics.3 It is the only mollusc
that has its entire body concealed within its shell,4 and the 6
io shell is a substance intermediate between hide and shell, so
that it cuts like a piece of hard leather. It is attached to
rocks by its shell, and is provided with two passages placed
at a distance from one another, very minute and hard to
see, whereby it admits and discharges the sea-water ; for it
15 has no visible excretion [whereas of shell fish in general
some resemble the urchin in this matter of excretion, and
others are provided with the so-called mecon, or poppy
juice].5 If the animal be opened, it is found to have, in
the first place, a tendinous membrane running round inside
the shell-like substance,6 and within this membrane is the
flesh-like substance of the ascidian, not resembling that in
other molluscs ; but this flesh, to which I now allude, is the
same in all ascidia. And this substance is attached in two
20 places to the membrane and the skin, obliquely; and at the
point of attachment the space is narrowed from side to
side, where the fleshy substance stretches towards the pas¬
sages that lead outwards through the shell ; and here it
discharges and admits food and liquid matter, just as it
would if one of the passages were a mouth and the other an
edd. have tj acopa ; it cannot be doubted that the allusion is to the whole oral mechanism now known as ‘ Aristotle’s lantern elaborately described by Cuvier, Lemons d'anat. comp., 1S05, iii. pp. 329-35. 1 The ‘ lantern ’ with which the comparison is made is a lantern set on a lamp-post, and therefore having its lower end pointed and not flattened ; the ‘lantern ’ of the sea-urchin is uncommonly like that on the poop of a galleon in old Dutch sea-pieces. 2 it. ictinotti. The ascidian, by the way, like the sea-urchin, is a common article of food in the Mediterranean : cf. II. xvi. 74 ; Athen. iii. 85, 92. As remedies, Xenocr. 29; Plin. xxxii. 30, 31, 39. 3 P.

anal vent; and one of the passages is somewhat wider than
the other one. Inside it has a pair of cavities, one on either 25
side, a small partition separating them ; and one of these
two cavities contains the liquid.1 The creature has no
other organ whether motor or sensory, nor, as was said
in the case of the others, is it furnished with any organ
connected with excretion, as other shell-fish are. The
colour of the ascidian is in some cases sallow, and in other ?0
cases red.2
There is, furthermore, the genus of the sea-nettles,3 pecu¬
liar in its way. The sea-nettle, or sea-anemone, clings to
rocks like certain of the testaceans, but at times relaxes
its hold. It has no shell, but its entire body is fleshy. It 53ib
is sensitive to touch,4 and, if you put your hand to it, it will
seize and cling to it, as the cuttle-fish would do with its
feelers, and in such a way as to make the flesh of your hand
swell up.5 Its mouth is in the centre of its body, and it
lives adhering to the rock as an oyster to its shell. If any 5
little fish6 come up against it it clings to it; in fact, just as
I described it above as doing to your hand, so it does to
anything edible that comes in its way; and it feeds upon
sea-urchins and scallops. Another species of the sea-nettle
roams freely abroad.7 The sea-nettle appears to be devoid
altogether of excretion,8 and in this respect it resembles a
plant. Of sea-nettles there are two species, the lesser and 10
more edible,0 and the large hard ones, such as are found in
1 Cf. P.A. iv. 5. 68ia 28. The two orifices are the mouth and the atrial aperture ; the two cavities, the pharynx or branchial sac, and the atrium or cloacal chamber. 2 The red is doubtless Cynthia papiliosa, which is bright scarlet; the sallow includes Phallusia mammillata and other large and common Ascidians. 3 Cf. Plin. ix. 45 (68); H.A. v. 16. 548s 23. 4 Cf. P.A. iv. 5. 681b 4. On the text see Dittmeyer. 5 Plin. ix. 45 (68) ‘ vis pruritu mordax’ ; cf. also Uiph. ap. Athen. iii. 90. G Cf.

the neighbourhood of Chalcis. In winter time 1 their flesh
is firm, and accordingly they are sought after as articles of
food, but in summer weather they are worthless,2 for they
I5 become thin and watery, and if you catch at them they
break at once into bits, and cannot be taken off the rocks
entire ; and being oppressed by the heat they tend to slip
back into the crevices of the rocks.3
So much for the external and the internal organs of
molluscs, crustaceans, and testaceans.
20 We now proceed to treat of insects in like manner. This 7
genus comprises many species, and, though several kinds
are clearly related to one another, these are not classified
under one common designation, as in the case of the bee,
the drone, the wasp, and all such insects, and again as in the
case of those that have their wings in a sheath or shard,
25 like the cockchafer, the carabusor stag-beetle, the cantharis
or blister-beetle,4 and the like.
Insects have three parts common to them all; the head,
the trunk containing the stomach, and a third part in betwixt
these two, corresponding to what in other creatures embraces
chest and back. In the majority of insects this intermediate
part is single; but in the long and multipedal insects it has
practically the same number of segments as of nicks.
30 All insects when cut in two continue to live, excepting
such as are naturally cold by nature, or such as from their
minute size chill rapidly; though, by the way, wasps not¬
withstanding their small size continue living after severance.
In conjunction with the middle portion either the head or
532a the stomach can live, but the head cannot live by itself.
Insects that are long in shape and many-footed can live for
a long while after being cut in twain, and the severed por¬
tions can move in either direction, backwards or forwards ;
thus, the hinder portion, if cut off, can crawl either in the

 BOOK IV. 7 532
direction of the section or in the direction of the tail, as is
observed in the scolopendra.1
All insects have eyes, but no other organ of sense discern- 5
ible, except that some insects have a kind of a tongue2
corresponding to a similar organ common to all testaceans ;
and by this organ such insects taste and imbibe 3 their food.
In some insects this organ is soft; in other insects it is firm ;
as it is, by the way, in the purple-fish, among testaceans.4
In the horsefly and the gadfly this organ is hard, and 10
indeed it is hard in most insects. In point of fact, such
insects as have no sting in the rear use this organ as a
weapon,5 (and, by the way, such insects as are provided
with this organ are unprovided with teeth, with the excep¬
tion of a few insects); the fly by a touch can draw
blood with this organ, and the gnat can prick or sting
with it.
Certain insects are furnished with prickers or stings.
Some insects have the sting inside, as the bee and the 15
wasp,6 others outside, as the scorpion; and, by the way,
this is the only insect furnished with a long tail.7 And,
further, the scorpion is furnished with claws, as is also the
creature resembling a scorpion 8 found within the pages of
books.
In addition to their other organs, flying insects are
furnished with wings. Some insects are dipterous or 20
double-winged, as the fly; others are tetrapterous or
furnished with four wings, as the bee; and, by the way,
no insect with only two wings has a sting in the rear.9
Again, some winged insects have a sheath or shard for
their wings, as the cockchafer ; whereas in others the wings

arc unsheathed, as in the bee. But in the case of all alike,
25 flight is in no way modified by tail-steerage, and the wing
is devoid of quill-structure or division of any kind.1
Again, some insects have antennae in front of their eyes,
as the butterfly and the horned-beetle. Such of them as
have the power of jumping have the hinder legs the longer ;
and these long hind-legs whereby they jump 2 bend back¬
wards like the hind-legs of quadrupeds. All insects have
30 the belly different from the back ; as, in fact, is the case
with all animals. The flesh of an insect’s body is neither
shell-like nor is it like the internal substance of shell
covered animals, nor is it like flesh3 in the ordinary sense
of the term; but it is a something intermediate in
quality.4 Wherefore they have nor spine, nor bone, nor
532b sepia-bone, nor enveloping shell ; but their body by its
hardness is its own protection and requires no extraneous
support. However, insects have a skin ; but the skin is
exceedingly thin. These and such-like are the external
organs of insects.
5 Internally, next after the mouth, comes a gut, in the
majority of cases straight and simple down to the outlet of
the residuum : but in a few cases the gut is coiled.'5 No
insect is provided with any viscera, or is supplied with fat;
and these statements apply to all animals devoid of blood.
Some have a stomach also,6 and attached to this the rest
of the gut, either simple or convoluted as in the case of
10 the acris or grasshopper.7
The tettix or cicada,8 alone ot such creatures (and, in
fact, alone of all creatures), is unprovided with a mouth,0
but it is provided with the tongue-like formation found in

insects furnished with frontward stings;1 and this forma¬
tion in the cicada is long, continuous, and devoid of any split;
and by the aid of this the creature feeds on dew, and on
dew only, and in its stomach no excretion is ever found.
Of the cicada there are several kinds,2 and they differ from
one another in relative magnitude, and in this respect that 15
the achetes 3 or chirper is provided with a cleft or aperture
under the hypozoma4 and has in it a membrane quite
discernible,5 whilst the membrane is indiscernible in the
tettigonia.
Furthermore, there are some strange creatures to be found
in the sea, which from their rarity we are unable to classify.
Experienced 6 fishermen affirm, some that they have at 20
times seen in the sea animals like sticks, black, rounded,
and of the same thickness throughout; others that they
have seen creatures resembling shields, red in colour, and
furnished with fins packed close together; and others that
they have seen creatures resembling the male organ in
shape and size, with a pair of fins in the place of the 25
testicles, and they aver that on one occasion a creature of
this description was brought up on the end of a night
line.7 * * *
So much then for the parts, external and internal, excep¬
tional and common, of all animals.
8 We now proceed to treat of the senses; for there are
diversities in animals with regard to the senses, seeing that 3°

 HISTORIA ANIMALIUM
532b
some animals have the use of all the senses, and others
the use of a limited number of them. The total number
of the senses (for we have no experience of any special
sense not here included), is five: sight, hearing, smell,
taste, and touch.
Man, then, and all vivipara that have feet, and, further,
533a all red-blooded ovipara,1 appear to have the use of all the
five senses, except where some isolated species has been
subjected to mutilation, as in the case of the mole.2 For
this animal is deprived of sight; it has no eyes visible, but
5 if the skin—a thick one, by the way—be stripped off the
head, about the place in the exterior where eyes usually
are, the eyes are found inside in a stunted condition,
furnished with all the parts found in ordinary eyes ; that
is to say, we find there the black rim, and the fatty part
surrounding it;3 but all these parts are smaller than the
10 same parts in ordinary visible eyes. There is no external
sign of the existence of these organs in the mole, owing to
the thickness of the skin drawn over them, so that it would
seem that the natural course of development were congeni¬
tally arrested ; [for extending from the brain 4 at its junction
with the marrow are two strong sinewy ducts running past
the sockets of the eyes, and terminating at the upper eye
15 teeth]. All the other animals of the kinds above mentioned
have a perception of colour 5 and of sound, and the senses
of smell and taste ; the fifth sense, that, namely, of touch,
is common to all animals whatsoever.
In some animals the organs of sense are plainly dis

cernible ; and this is especially the case with the eyes.1
For animals have a special locality for the eyes, and also 20
a special locality for hearing: that is to say, some animals
have ears, while others have the passage for sound dis¬
cernible.2 It is the same with the sense of smell ; that is
to say, some animals have nostrils, and others have only the
passages for smell, such as birds. It is the same also with
the organ of taste, the tongue. Of aquatic red-blooded 25
animals,3 fishes possess the organ of taste, namely the
tongue, but it is in an imperfect and amorphous form,4 in
other words it is osseous and undetached. In some fish the
palate 5 is fleshy, as in the fresh-water carp, so that by an
inattentive observer it might be mistaken for a tongue.0 30
There is no doubt but that fishes have the sense of taste,
for a great number of them delight in special flavours ; and
fishes freely take the hook if it be baited with a piece of
flesh from a tunny or from any fat fish, obviously enjoying
the taste and the eating of food of this kind. Fishes have
no visible organs for hearing or for smell;7 for what might 53313
appear to indicate an organ for smell in the region of the
nostril has no communication with the brain. These indica¬
tions, in fact, in some cases lead nowhere, like blind alleys,
and in other cases lead only to the gills; but for all this
fishes undoubtedly hear and smell. For they are observed 5
to run away from any loud noise, such as would be made
by the rowing of a galley, so as to become easy of capture
in their holes ; for, by the way, though a sound be very
slight in the open air, it has a loud and alarming resonance
to creatures that hear under water.8 And this is shown in
the capture of the dolphin; for when the hunters have 10
enclosed a shoal of these fishes with a ring of their canoes,
they set up from inside the canoes a loud splashing in the

water, and by so doing induce the creatures to run in a
shoal high and dry up on the beach, and so capture them
while stupefied with the noise.1 And yet, for all this, the
dolphin has no organ of hearing discernible.2 Furthermore,
'5 when engaged in their craft, fishermen are particularly
careful to make no noise with oar or net; and after they
have spied a shoal, they let down their nets at a spot so far
off that they count upon no noise being likely to reach the
shoal, occasioned either by oar or by the surging of their
20 boats through the water ; and the crews are strictly enjoined
to preserve silence until the shoal has been surrounded.
And, at times, when they want the fish to crowd together,
they adopt the stratagem of the dolphin-hunter ; in other
words they clatter stones together, that the fish may, in
their fright, gather close into one spot, and so they envelop
25 them within their nets. [Before surrounding them, then, they
preserve silence, as was said ; but, after hemming the shoal
in, they call on every man to shout out aloud and make
any kind of noise; for on hearing the noise and hubbub the
fish are sure to tumble into the nets from sheer fright.] 3
Further, when fishermen see a shoal of fish feeding at a
-o distance, disporting themselves in calm bright weather on
the surface of the water, if they are anxious to descry the
size of the fish and to learn what kind of a fish it is, they
may succeed in coming upon the shoal whilst yet basking
at the surface if they sail up without the slightest noise,
but if any man make a noise previously, the shoal will be
seen to scurry away in alarm. Again, there is a small
534a river-fish called the cottus4 or bull-head ; this creature
burrows under a rock, and fishers catch it by clattering
stones against the rock, and the fish, bewildered at the
noise, darts out of its hiding-place. From these facts it is
? quite obvious that fishes can hear ; and indeed some people,
1 A similar procedure is described by Apostolides {op. fit. p. 33) in the capture of (rwaypldes, Dentex vulgaris. A hollow cone on a long handle is used for striking the water by Adriatic fishermen, and is known as piston, stumigio, &c. (Faber, Fish, of Adriatic, p. 133). 2 H.A. i. 11. 492a 29. 3 [ ] A- and W. * MSS. have 0on-or and koitor. Sylburg restored kottos, from Gaza.

from living near the sea and frequently witnessing such
phenomena, affirm that of all living creatures the fish is the
quickest of hearing. And, by the way, of all fishes the
quickest of hearing are the cestreus or mullet, the chremps}
the labrax or basse,1 2 the salpe or saupe,3 the chromis or
sciaena,4 and such like.5 Other fishes are less quick of io
hearing, and, as might be expected, are more apt to be
found living at the bottom of the sea.
The case is similar in regard to the sense of smell.6
Thus, as a rule, fishes will not touch a bait that is not fresh,
neither are they all caught by one and the same bait, but
they are severally caught by baits suited to their several
likings, and these baits they distinguish by their sense of
smell;7 and, by the way, some fishes are attracted by 15
malodorous baits, as the saupe, for instance, is attracted
by excrement. Again, a number of fishes live in caves;
and accordingly fishermen, when they want to entice them
out, smear the mouth of a cave8 with strong-smelling pickles,
and the fish are soon attracted to the smell. And the eel 20
is caught in a similar way; for the fisherman lays down an
earthen pot that has held pickles, after inserting a £ weel5
in the neck thereof. As a general rule, fishes are especially
attracted by savoury smells. For this reason, fishermen
roast the fleshy parts of the cuttle-fish and use it as bait
on account of its smell, for fish are peculiarly attracted by
it; they also bake the octopus and bait their fish-baskets 25
or weels with it, entirely, as they say, on account of its
smell. Furthermore, gregarious fishes,9 if fish-washings or
bilge-water be thrown overboard, are observed to scud off

to a distance, from apparent dislike of the smell. And it is
asserted that they can at once detect by smell the presence
534b of their own blood ; and this faculty is manifested by their
hurrying off to a great distance whenever fish-blood is spilt
in the sea. And, as a general rule, if you bait your weel
with a stinking bait, the fish refuse to enter the weel or
even to draw near ; but if you bait the weel with a fresh
5 and savoury bait, they come at once from long distances
and swim into it. [And all this is particularly manifest in
the dolphin ; for, as was stated, it has no visible organ of
hearing, and yet it is captured when stupefied with noise;
and so, while it has no visible organ for smell, it has the
io sense of smell remarkably keen.] 1 It is manifest, then,
that the animals above mentioned are in possession of all
the five senses.
All other animals may, with very few exceptions, be
comprehended within four genera: to wit, molluscs, crusta
15 ceans, testaceans, and insects. Of these four genera, the
mollusc,2 the crustacean, and the insect have all the senses:
at all events, they have sight,3 smell, and taste. As for
insects, both winged and wingless, they can detect the
presence of scented objects afar off, as for instance bees
and cnipes4 detect the presence of honey at a distance;
20 and they do so recognizing it by smell. Many insects are
killed by the smell of brimstone ; 5 ants, if the apertures to
their dwellings be smeared with powdered origanum and
brimstone, quit their nests ; and most insects may be
banished with burnt hart’s horn, or better still by the
25 burning of the gum styrax. The cuttle-fish, the octopus,
and the crawfish may be caught by bait.7 The octopus,
in fact, clings so tightly to the rocks that it cannot be

pulled off, but remains attached even when the knife is
employed to sever it; and yet, if you apply fleabane to the
creature, it drops off at the very smell of it.1 The facts are
similar in regard to taste. For the food that insects go in 535**
quest of is of diverse kinds, and they do not all delight in
the same flavours : for instance, the bee2 never settles on
a withered or wilted flower, but on fresh and sweet ones ;
and the conops or gnat3 settles only on acrid substances
and not on sweet. The sense of touch, by the way, as has
been remarked, is common to all animals. Testaceans 5
have the senses of smell and taste. With regard to their
possession of the sense of smell, that is proved by the use
of baits, e.g. in the case of the purple-fish ; for this creature
is enticed by baits of rancid meat, which it perceives and is
attracted to from a great distance. The proof that it
possesses a sense of taste hangs by the proof of its sense of io
smell; for whenever an animal is attracted to a thing by
perceiving its smell, it is sure to like the taste of it. Further,
all animals furnished with a mouth derive pleasure or pain
from the touch of sapid juices.
With regard to sight and hearing, we cannot make state¬
ments with thorough confidence or on irrefutable evidence.
However, the solen or razor-fish, if you make a noise,
appears to burrow in the sand, and to hide himself deeper 15
when he hears the approach of the iron rod4 (for the
animal, be it observed, juts a little out of its hole, while the
greater part of the body remains within),—and scallops, if
you present your finger near their open valves, close them
tight5 again as though they could see what you were doing.
Furthermore, when fishermen are laying bait for neritae, 20

 HISTORTA ANIMALIUM
535a
they always get to leeward of them, and never speak
a word while so engaged, under the firm impression that
the animal can smell and hear ; and they assure us that, if
any one speaks aloud, the creature makes efforts to escape.
With regard to testaceans, of the walking or creeping
species the urchin appears to have the least developed
sense of smell ; and, of the stationary species, the ascidian
25 and the barnacle.
So much for the organs of sense in the general run of
animals. We now proceed to treat of voice.
Voice and sound are different from one another; and 9
language differs from voice and sound. The fact is that
no animal can give utterance to voice except by the action
of the pharynx,1 and consequently such animals as
are devoid of lung have no voice ; and language is the
30 articulation of vocal sounds by the instrumentality of the
tongue. Thus, the voice and larynx can emit vocal or
vowel sounds ; non-vocal or consonantal sounds are made
535b by the tongue and the lips ; and out of these vocal and
non-vocal sounds language is composed. Consequently,
animals that have no tongue at all or that have a tongue
not freely detached, have neither voice2 nor language;
although, by the way, they may be enabled to make noises
or sounds by other organs than the tongue.
Insects, for instance, have no voice and no language, but
they can emit sound by internal air or wind, though not by
5 the emission of air or wind ; for no insects are capable of
respiration.3 But some of them make a humming noise,
like the bee and the other winged insects ; and others are
said to sing, as the cicada.1 And all these latter insects
make their special noises by means of the membrane that
is underneath the ‘ hypozoma ’—those insects, that is to
say, whose body is thus divided ;6 as for instance, one

species of cicada, which makes the sound by means of the
friction of the air.1 Flies and bees, and the like, produce io
their special noise by opening and shutting their wings in
the act of flying ; for the noise made is by the friction of
air between the wings when in motion. The noise made
by grasshoppers is produced by rubbing or reverberating
with their long hind-legs.2
No mollusc or crustacean can produce any natural voice
or sound. Fishes can produce no voice, for they have no
lungs, nor windpipe and pharynx; but they emit certain inar- 15
ticulate sounds and squeaks, which is what is called their
‘voice’,3 as thelyra* or gurnard, and the sciaena5 * (for these
fishes make a grunting kind of noise) and the capriis or
boar-fish in the river Achelous,0 and the chalcis7 and the
cuckoo-fish ;4 for the chalcis makes a sort of piping sound,
and the cuckoo-fish makes a sound greatly like the cry of 20
the cuckoo, and is nicknamed from the circumstance. The
apparent voice in all these fishes is a sound caused in some
cases by a rubbing motion of their gills,8 which by the way

Sometimes the hind-leg rubs against the elytron or fore¬ wing (Acridiidae), sometimes one elytron against the other (Gryllidae, Locustidae). Cf. (in/, al.) Latreille, Mem. Mus. d'Hist.

T. lyra, L., the ‘piper’ of English fishermen, and T. pint, Bloch (both called T. cuculus by Linnaeus), seem to be the ‘ cuckoofish ’, and are still so called in various Mediterranean dialects; the common gurnard, T. gurnardus, is a ‘grunter’, Fr. grondin, grognant, Germ.

arc prickly,1 or in other cases by internal parts about their
bellies; for they all have air or wind inside them,2 * by
rubbing and moving which they produce the sounds/1
25 Some cartilaginous fish seem to squeak.
But in these cases the term ‘ voice ’ is inappropriate ; the
more correct expression would be * sound \ For the scallop,
when it goes along supporting itself on the water, which is
technically called £ flying makes a whizzing sound; and
so does the sea-swallow or flying-fish :4 for this fish flies in
the air, clean out of the water, being furnished with fins
30 broad and long. Just then as in the flight of birds the
sound made by their wings is obviously not voice, so is it
in the case of all these other creatures.
The dolphin, when taken out of the water, gives a squeak
53ba and moans in the air, but these noises do not resemble
those above mentioned. For this creature has a voice (and
can therefore utter vocal or vowel sounds), for it is fur¬
nished with a lung and a windpipe; but its tongue is not
loose, nor has it lips, so as to give utterance to an articulate
sound (or a sound of vowel and consonant in combination).
Of animals which are furnished with tongue and lung,5 * 7
5 the oviparous quadrupeds produce a voice, but a feeble
one ; in some cases, a shrill piping sound, like the serpent;
in others, a thin faint cry ;G in others, a low hiss, like the
tortoise. The formation of the tongue in the frog is ex¬
ceptional. The front part of the tongue, which in other
animals is detached, is tightly fixed in the frog as it is in
10 all fishes; but the part towards the pharynx is freely
detached, and may, so to speak, be spat outwards," and it

is with this that it makes its peculiar croak. The croaking
that goes on in the marsh is the call of the males to the
females at rutting time ;1 and, by the way, all animals have
a special cry for the like end at the like season, as is
observed in the case of goats, swine, and sheep. [The 15
bull-frog makes its croaking noise by putting its under jaw
on a level with the surface of the water and extending its
upper jaw to its utmost capacity. The tension is so great
that the upper jaw becomes transparent, and the animal’s
eyes shine through the jaw like lamps ;2 for, by the way,
the commerce of the sexes takes place usually in the night
time.]
Birds can utter vocal sounds ; and such of them can 20
articulate best as have the tongue moderately flat, and also
such as have thin delicate3 tongues. In some cases, the
male and the female utter the same note; in other cases,
different notes. The smaller birds are more vocal and
given to chirping than the larger ones ; but in the pairing
season every species of bird becomes particularly vocal. 25
Some of them call when fighting, as the quail, others cry
or crow when challenging to combat, as the partridge,4 or
when victorious, as the barn-door cock. In some cases
cock-birds and hens sing alike, as is observed in the night¬
ingale, only that the hen stops singing when brooding or 30
rearing her young;5 in other birds, the cocks sing morec
than the hens ; in fact, with barn-door fowls and quails, the
cock sings and the hen does not.
Viviparous quadrupeds utter vocal sounds of different
kinds, but they have no power of converse. In fact, this 536b
1 Ael. ix. 13. 2 A. and W. bracket nnid Se . . . ivKTwp (which, however, Plin. xi. 65 follows) as unintelligible.

 536b HISTORIA ANIMALIUM
power, or language, is peculiar to man. For while the
capability of talking implies the capability of uttering vocal
sounds, the converse does not hold good. Men that are
born deaf are in all cases also dumb ; that is, they can
5 make vocal sounds, but they cannot speak. Children, just
as they have no control over other parts, so have no con¬
trol, at first, over the tongue ; but it is so far imperfect,1
and only frees and detaches itself by degrees, so that in
the interval children for the most part lisp and stutter.2 *
Vocal sounds and modes of language differ according to
locality. Vocal sounds are characterized chiefly by their
io pitch, whether high or low, and the kinds of sound capable
of being produced are identical within the limits of one
and the same species ; but articulate sound, that one might
reasonably designate ‘ language ’, differs both in various
animals, and also in the same species according to diversity
of locality; as for instance, some partridges cackle, and
some make a shrill twittering noise/' Of little birds, some
15 sing a different note from the parent birds, if they have
been removed from the nest and have heard other birds
singing; and a mother-nightingale has been observed to
give lessons in singing to a young bird,4 from which spec¬
tacle we might obviously infer that the song of the bird
was not equally congenital5 with mere voice, but was
something capable of modification and of improvement.6
Men have the same voice or vocal sounds, but they differ
20 from one another in speech or language.
The elephant makes a vocal sound of a wind-like sort by
the mouth alone, unaided by the trunk, just like the sound
of a man panting or sighing ;7 but, if it employ the trunk

 BOOK IV. 9 536b
as well, the sound produced is like that of a hoarse
trumpet.
io With regard to the sleeping and waking of animals, all
creatures that are red-blooded and provided with legs give 25
sensible proof that they go to sleep and that they waken
up from sleep ;1 2 for, as a matter of fact, all animals that are
furnished with eyelids shut them up when they go to
sleep. Furthermore, it would appear that not only do
men dream, but horses also, and dogs, and oxen; aye, and
sheep, and goats, and all viviparous quadrupeds ; and dogs 30
show their dreaming by barking in their sleep. With
regard to oviparous animals we cannot be sure that they
dream, but most undoubtedly they sleep. And the same
may be said of water animals, such as fishes, molluscs,
crustaceans, to wit crawfish and the like. These animals 537a
sleep without doubt, although their sleep is of very short
duration. The proof of their sleeping cannot be got from
the condition of their eyes—for none of these creatures are
furnished with eyelids—but can be obtained only from
their motionless repose.
2 Apart from the irritation caused by lice and what are 5
nicknamed fleas,3 fish are met with in a state so motionless
that one might easily catch them by hand ; and, as a
matter of fact, these little creatures, if the fish remain long
in one position,4 will attack them in myriads and devour
them. For these parasites are found in the depths of the
sea, and are so numerous that they devour any bait made
of fish’s flesh if it be left long on the ground at the bottom ; 10

The cognate passage in Plin. ix. 71 simply tells us that lice exist in the sea, and are supposed to disturb the fishes’ slumbers : ‘ nihil non gignitur in mari ; ut cauponarum (conopeorum, Scalig.) etiam aestiva animalia pernici molesta saltu, et quae capillus maxime celat, exsistant, et circumglobata escae saepe extrahantur : quae causa somnum piscium in mari noctibus infestare existimatur.’ 3 The ‘ fleas ’ are probably small Amphipods (Scotice ‘ sandy loupers ’) ; the Arabs call shrimps barghut-el-bahr, i.e. sea-fleas. 4 Schn. and Picc. add iv tois diKrvois.

537a
and fishermen often draw up a cluster of them, all clinging
on to the bait.1
But it is from the following facts that we may more
reasonably infer that fishes sleep. Very often it is possible
to take a fish off its guard so far as to catch hold of it or
15 to give it a blow unawares; and all the while that you are
preparing to catch or strike it, the fish is quite still but for
a slight motion of the tail. And it is quite obvious that
the animal is sleeping, from its movements if any disturbance
be made during its repose ; for it moves just as you would
expect in a creature suddenly awakened. Further, owing
to their being asleep, fish may be captured by torchlight.2
The watchmen in the tunny-fishery 3 often take advantage
of the fish being asleep to envelop them in a circle of nets;
20 and it is quite obvious that they were thus sleeping by
their lying still and allowing the glistening under-parts of
their bodies to become visible, while the capture is taking
place. They sleep in the night-time more than during the
day; and so soundly at night that you may cast the net
without making them stir.4 Fish, as a general rule, sleep
close to the ground, or to the sand or to a stone at the
bottom, or after concealing themselves under a rock or the
25 ground. Flat fish go to sleep in the sand ; and they can
be distinguished by the outlines of their shapes in the sand,
and are caught in this position by being speared with
pronged instruments. The basse, the chrysophrys or gilt
head, the mullet, and fish of the like sort are often caught
in the daytime by the prong 5 owing to their having been

surprised when sleeping ; for it is scarcely probable that
such fish could be pronged while awake. Cartilaginous 30
fish sleep at times so soundly that they may be caught by
hand. The dolphin and the whale, and all such as are
furnished with a blow-hole, sleep with the blow-hole over 537b
the surface of the water, and breathe through the blow¬
hole while they keep up a quiet flapping of their fins;
indeed, some mariners assure us that they have actually
heard the dolphin snoring.1 2
Molluscs sleep like fishes, and crustaceans also. It is 5
plain also that insects sleep ; for there can be no mistaking
their condition of motionless repose. In the bee - the fact
of its being asleep is very obvious ; for at night-time bees
are at rest and cease to hum. But the fact that insects
sleep may be very well seen in the case of common every¬
day creatures; for not only do they rest at night-time 10
from dimness of vision (and, by the way, all hard-eyed
creatures see but indistinctly),3 but even if a lighted candle
be presented they continue sleeping quite as soundly.4
Of all animals man is most given to dreaming. Children
and infants do not dream,5 but in most cases dreaming 15
comes on at the age of four or five years. Instances have
been known of full-grown men and women that have never
dreamed at all ;6 in exceptional cases of this kind, it has
been observed that when a dream occurs in advanced life
it prognosticates either actual dissolution or a general
break-up of the system. 20
So much then for sensation and for the phenomena of
sleeping and of awakening.
II With regard to sex, some animals are divided into male
and female, but others are not so divided, but can only be
said in a comparative way to bring forth young and to be

pregnant.1 In animals that live confined to one spot there
25 is no duality of sex ; nor is there such, in fact, in any
testaceans.2 In molluscs and in crustaceans we find male
and female: and, indeed, in all animals furnished with feet,3
biped or quadruped ; in short, in all such as by copulation
engender either live young or egg or grub. In the several
genera, with however certain exceptions, there either
absolutely is or absolutely is not a duality of sex. Thus,
30 in quadrupeds the duality is universal, while the absence of
such duality is universal in testaceans, and of these creatures,
as with plants, some individuals are fruitful and some
538a are not.4
But among insects and fishes, some cases are found5 *
wholly devoid of this duality of sex. For instance, the eel
is neither male nor female, and can engender nothing.0 In
fact, those who assert that eels are at times found with
5 hair-like or worm-like progeny attached,7 make only
random assertions from not having carefully noticed the
locality of such attachments. For no eel nor animal of
this kind is ever viviparous unless previously oviparous ; and
no eel was ever yet seen with an egg. And animals that
are viviparous have their young in the womb and closely
attached, and not in the belly ; for, if the embryo were kept
10 in the belly, it would be subjected to the process of digestion
like ordinary food. When people rest duality of sex in the
eel on the assertion that the head of the male is bigger
and longer, and the head of the female smaller and more
snubbed, they are taking diversity of species for diversity
of sex.8

It is a recent discovery that eels spawn in the depths of the ocean, from which they never afterwards return. 7 Read TTpoa-TrerfivKor. 8 Cf. H.A. viii. 30. 6oSa 5. Yarrell, Gunther, and others, like A., have held the difference to be specific. We now know that the eels with large, broad, ‘ frog-mouthed ’ heads are females (C. J. G. Petersen, Fiskeri-Beretninger, v. 1896, Copenhagen).


 BOOK IV. ii 538*
There are certain fish that are nicknamed the epitragiae}
or capon-fish, and, by the way, fish of this description are
found in fresh water, as the carp and the balagrus.1 2 This 15
sort of fish never has either roe or milt; but they are
hard and fat all over, and are furnished with a small gut;
and these fish are regarded as of super-excellent quality.
Again, just as in testaceans and in plants there is what
bears and engenders, but not what impregnates, so is it,
among fishes, with the psetta, the erythrinus, and the 20
channe;3 for these fish are in all cases found furnished
with eggs.4
As a general rule, in red-blooded animals furnished with
feet and not oviparous, the male is larger and longer-lived
than the female (except with the mule, where the female is
longer-lived and bigger than the male); whereas in ovi- 25
parous and venniparous creatures, as in fishes and in
insects,5 the female is larger than the male; as, for instance,
with the serpent, the phalangium or venom-spider, the
gecko, and the frog. The same difference in size of the
sexes is found in fishes, as, for instance, in the smaller
cartilaginous fishes, in the greater part of the gregarious
species, and in all that live in and about rocks. The fact 30
that the female is longer-lived than the male is inferred
from the fact that female fishes are caught older than males. 538b
Furthermore, in all animals the upper and front parts are
1 Plut. Thes. 18. 2 The ftdXaypos is unidentified, but the word may be akin to bulbero, a name for the carp in the Adriatic. It may be, as Rondelet takes it, the Crucian or Prussian carp, Carassius vulgaris. 3 That the genus Serranus is hermaphrodite was rediscovered by Cavolini. According to Erhard S. cabrilla is now known as ^di/roy, S. scriba as nipta; but both species, according to Faber, are called Perga or pirca in the Adriatic, and a description of x<*vvrt iR Athen. vii. 327b agrees with S. scriba. (On channa cf. Ovid, Hal. 108 ; Plin. ix. 77, xxxii. 34.) IpvBfnvos suggests the scarlet colour of S. anthias. yj/r/rra is apparently a flatfish (Ael. xiv. 3 ; Athen. 330b), and has no known relation to the context. If we dared substitute 7repjca for it, we should have here together the three species of the hermaphrodite seaperch. For a detailed list of hermaphrodite fishes cf. Max Weber, Tijdsch. d. Ned. Dierk.

belter, stronger, and more thoroughly equipped1 in the
male than in the female, whereas in the female those parts
are the better that may be termed hinder-parts or under
5 parts.2 And this statement is applicable to man and to
all vivipara that have feet. Again, the female is less
muscular and less compactly jointed,3 and more thin and
delicate in the hair—that is, where hair is found ; and, where
there is no hair, less strongly furnished in some analogous
substance. And the female is more flaccid in texture
io of flesh, and more knock-kneed, and the shin-bones are
thinner ; and the feet are more arched and hollow in such
animals as are furnished with feet. And with regard to
voice, the female in all animals that are vocal has a thinner
and sharper voice than the male ;4 except, by the way,
with kine, for the lowing and bellowing of the cow has
15 a deeper note than that of the bull.5 6 With regard to
organs of defence and offence, such as teeth, tusks, horns,
spurs, and the like, these in some species the male possesses
and the female does not; as, for instance, the hind has no
horns, and where the cock-bird has a spur the hen is
20 entirely destitute of the organ ;G and in like manner the
sow is devoid of tusks. In other species such organs are
found in both sexes, but are more perfectly developed in
- the male ; as, for instance, the horn of the bull is more
powerful than the horn of the cow.7

 BOOK V
As to the parts internal and external that all animals are 538b
furnished withal, and further as to the senses, to voice, and
sleep, and the duality of sex, all these topics have now been 3°
touched upon. It now remains for us to discuss, duly and 539a
in order, their several modes of propagation.
These modes are many and diverse, and in some
respects are like, and in other respects are unlike to one
another. As we carried on our previous discussion genus
by genus, so we must attempt to follow the same 5
divisions in our present argument ; only that whereas
in the former case we started with a consideration
of the parts of man, in the present case it behoves us to
treat of man last of all because he involves most discussion.1
We shall commence, then, with testaceans, and then proceed 10
to crustaceans, and then to the other genera in due order ;
and these other genera are, severally, molluscs, and insects,
then fishes viviparous and fishes oviparous, and next birds ;
and afterwards we shall treat of animals provided with feet,
both such as are oviparous and such as are viviparous; and
we may observe that some 2 quadrupeds are viviparous, but
that the only viviparous biped is man. 15
?* Now there is one property that animals are found to
have in common with plants.4 For some plants are
generated from the seed of plants, whilst other plants
are self-generated through the formation of some elemental
principle similar to a seed ; and of these latter plants some
derive their nutriment from the ground, whilst others grow
inside other plants, as is mentioned, by the way, in my 20
treatise on Botany.5 So with animals, some spring from

parent animals according to their kind, whilst others grow
spontaneously and not from kindred stock ; and of these
instances of spontaneous generation some come from putre¬
fying earth or vegetable matter,1 as is the case with a
number of insects, while others are spontaneously generated
25 in the inside of animals out of the secretions of their
several organs.
In animals where generation goes by heredity, wherever
there is duality of sex generation is due to copulation. In
the group of fishes, however, there are some that are neither
male nor female, and these, while they are identical generi
cally with other fish, differ from them specifically ;2 but
there are others that stand altogether isolated and apart by
themselves. Other fishes there are that are always female
30 and never male,3 and frpm them are conceived 4 what cor¬
respond to the wind-eggs in birds. Such eggs, by the
way, in birds are all unfruitful; but it is their nature
to be independently capable of generation up to the
539b egg-stage,5 unless indeed there be some other mode than
the one familiar to us of intercourse with the male ; but
concerning these topics we shall treat more precisely
later on.0 In the case of certain fishes, however, after they
have spontaneously generated eggs, these eggs develop
into living animals; only that in certain of these cases
development is spontaneous, and in others is not inde
5 pendent of the male ; and the method of proceeding in
regard to these matters will be set forth by and by, for the
method is somewhat like to the method followed in the
case of birds.7 But whensoever creatures are spontaneously
generated, either in other animals, in the soil, or on plants, or
in the parts of these, and when such are generated male
and female, then from the copulation of such spontaneously

generated males and females there is generated a something io
—a something never identical in shape with the parents, but
a something imperfect.1 For instance, the issue of copula¬
tion in lice is nits; in flies, grubs ; in fleas,2 grubs egg-like
in shape; and from these issues the parent-species is never
reproduced, nor is any animal produced at all, but the like
nondescripts only.3
First, then, we must proceed to treat of c covering ’ in
regard to such animals as cover and are covered ; and then
after this to treat in due order of other matters, both the 15
exceptional and those of general occurrence.
2 Those animals, then, cover and are covered in which
there is a duality of sex, and the modes of covering in such
animals are not in all cases similar nor analogous.4 For
the red-blooded animals that are viviparous and furnished
with feet •’* have in all cases organs adapted for procreation, 20
but the sexes do not in all cases come together in like
manner. Thus, opisthuretic animals copulate with a rear¬
ward presentment, as is the case with the lion, the hare,
and the lynx;6 though, by the way, in the case of the hare,
the female is often observed to cover the male.
The case is similar in most other such animals ; that is to 25
say, the majority of quadrupeds copulate as best they can, the
male mounting the female ; and this is the only method of co¬
pulating adopted by birds,though there arecertain diversities
of method observed even in birds.7 For in some cases the
female squats on the ground and the male mounts on top 3°
of her, as is the case with the cock and hen bustard,8 and
the barn-door cock and hen; in other cases, the male
mounts without the female squatting, as with the male and

female crane;1 for, with these birds, the male mounts on to
the back of the female and covers her, and like the cock
sparrow consumes but very little time in the operation. Of
quadrupeds, bears perform the operation lying prone on
540a one another,2 in the same way as other quadrupeds do
while standing up ; that is to say, with the belly of the
male pressed to the back of the female. Hedgehogs
copulate erect, belly to belly.3
With regard to large-sized vivipara, the hind only very
rarely sustains the mounting of the stag to the full conclu
5 sion of the operation, and the same is the case with the cow
as regards the bull,4 owing to the rigidity of the penis of
the bull. In point of fact, the females of these animals
elicit the sperm of the male in the act of withdrawing from
underneath him ; and, by the way, this phenomenon has
been observed in the case of the stag and hind, domes¬
ticated, of course. Covering with the wolf is the same as
io with the dog. Cats do not copulate with a rearward pre¬
sentment on the part of the female, but the male stands
erect and the female puts herself underneath him;5 * and,
by the way, the female cat is peculiarly lecherous, and
wheedles the male on to sexual commerce, and caterwauls
during the operation.0 Camels copulate with the female
in a sitting posture, and the male straddles over and covers
her, not with the hinder presentment on the female’s part
15 but like the other quadrupeds mentioned above, and they
pass the whole day long in the operation ; when thus
engaged they retire to lonely spots,7 and none but their
keeper dare approach them. And, be it observed, the
penis of the camel is so sinewy that bow-strings are
20 manufactured out of it. Elephants, also, copulate in lonely
places,8 and especially by river-sides in their usual haunts ;
the female squats down, and straddles with her legs, and
the male mounts and covers her. The seal covers like all

 BOOK V. 2 540
opisthuretic animals, and in this species the copulation
extends over a lengthened time, as is the case with the
dog and bitch ; and the penis in the male seal is excep- 25
tionally large.
3 Oviparous quadrupeds cover one another in the same
way. That is to say, in some cases the male mounts the
female precisely as in the viviparous animals,1 as is observed
in both the land and the sea tortoise. . . . And these
creatures have an organ in which the ducts converge, and 30
with which they perform the act of copulation, as is also
observed in the toad,2 the frog, and all other animals of
the same group.
4 Long animals devoid of feet, like serpents and muraenae,
intertwine in coition, belly to belly.3 And, in fact, serpents 540
coil round one another so tightly as to present the
appearance of a single serpent with a pair of heads. The
s ame mode is followed by the saurians ; that is to say,
they coil round one another in the act of coition. 5
5 All fishes, with the exception of the flat selachians, lie
down side by side, and copulate belly to belly. Fishes,4
however, that are flat and furnished with tails—as the ray,
the trygon,5 and the like—copulate not only in this way,
but also, where the tail from its thinness 6 is no impediment,
by mounting of the male upon the female, belly to back. 10
But the rhina or angel-fish,7 and other like fishes where the
tail is large, copulate only by rubbing against one another
sideways, belly to belly. Some men assure us that they
have seen some of the selachia copulating hindways, like
dog and bitch. In all the cartilaginous species the female 15
is larger than the male ; and the same is the case with other

fishes for the most part.1 And among cartilaginous fishes
are included, besides those already named, the bos,2 the
lamia,3 the aetos,4 the narce or torpedo, the fishing-frog,
and all the galeodes or sharks and dogfish.5 Cartilaginous
fishes, then, of all kinds, have in many instances been
20 observed copulating in the way above mentioned ; for, by
the way, in viviparous animals the process of copulation is
of longer duration than in the ovipara.
It is the same with the dolphin and with all cetaceans ;6
that is to say, they come side by side, male and female, and
copulate, and the act extends over a time which is neither
short nor very long.
Again, in cartilaginous fishes the male, in some species,
25 differs from the female in the fact that he is furnished with
two appendages hanging down from about the exit of the
residuum, and that the female is not so furnished ; and this
distinction between the sexes is observed in all the species
of the sharks and dog-fish.
7 Now neither fishes nor any animals devoid of feet are
30 furnished with testicles,8 but male serpents and male fishes
have a pair of ducts which fill with milt or sperm at the
rutting season, and discharge, in all cases, a milk-like juice.
These ducts unite, as in birds; for birds, by the way, have
54ia their testicles in their interior, and so have all ovipara
that are furnished with feet. And this union of the ducts
is so far continued and of such extension as to enter the
receptive organ in the female.

 BOOK V. 5 54i
In viviparous animals furnished with feet there is out¬
wardly one and the same duct for the sperm and the liquid
residuum ;1 but there are separate ducts internally, as has 5
been observed in the differentiation of the organs. And
with such animals as are not viviparous 2 the same passage
serves for the discharge also of the solid residuum ; although,
internally, there are two passages,3 separate but near to
one another. And these remarks apply to both male and
female ; for these animals are unprovided with a bladder
except in the case of the tortoise; and the she-tortoise,4 5 10
though furnished with a bladder, has only one passage ;
and tortoises, by the way, belong to the ovipara.
In the case of oviparous fishes the process of coition is
less open to observation. In point of fact, some are led by
the want of actual observation to surmise that the female
becomes impregnated by swallowing the seminal fluid of
the male. And there can be no doubt that this proceeding
on the part of the female is often witnessed ; for at the rutting
season the females follow the males and perform this opera- 15
tion, and strike the males with their mouths under the
belly, and the males are thereby induced to part with
the sperm sooner and more plentifully. And, further, at the
spawning season the males go in pursuit of the females,
and, as the female spawns, the males swallow the eggs;0
and the species is continued in existence by the spawn that
survives this process. On the coast of Phoenicia they take
advantage of these instinctive propensities of the two sexes
to catch both one and the other: that is to say, by using
the male of the grey mullet as a decoy they collect and net 2o
the female, and by using the female, the male.'1

The scarus is caught in the same way, as also in Oppian’s time {Hal. iv. 40-110).

The repeated observation of this phenomenon has led to
the notion that the process was equivalent to coition, but
the fact is that a similar phenomenon is observable in
quadrupeds. For at the rutting seasons both the males
25 and the females take to running at their genitals, and the
two sexes take to smelling each other at those parts.1
[With partridges,2 by the way, if the female gets to
leeward of the male, she becomes thereby impregnated.
And often when they happen to be in heat she is affected
in this wise by the voice of the male, or by his breathing
down on her as he flies overhead ;3 and, by the way, both
the male and the female partridge keep the mouth wide
30 open and protrude the tongue in the process of coition.] 4
The actual process of copulation on the part of oviparous
fishes is seldom accurately observed, owing to the fact that
they very soon fall aside and slip asunder. But, for all
that, the process has been observed to take place in the
manner above described.
54*b Molluscs, such as the octopus, the sepia, and the 6
calamary, have sexual intercourse all in the same way;5 *
that is to say, they unite at the mouth, by an interlacing of
their tentacles. When, then, the octopus rests its so-called
5 head fJ against the ground and spreads abroad its tentacles,
the other sex fits into the outspreading of these tentacles,
and the two sexes then bring their suckers into mutual
connexion.
Some assert that the male has a kind of penis in one of
his tentacles,7 the one in which are the [two]8 largest
10 suckers; and they further assert that the organ is ten

dinous1 in character, growing attached right up to the io
middle of the tentacle, and that the latter enables it to
enter the nostril or funnel 2 of the female.
Now cuttle-fish and calamaries swim about closely inter¬
twined, with mouths and tentacles facing one another and
fitting closely together, and swim thus in opposite direc¬
tions ;3 and they fit their so-called nostrils into one
another, and the one sex swims backwards and the other
frontwards during the operation. And the female lays its
spawn by the so-called ‘blow-hole’;4 5 and, by the way, 15
some declare that it is at this organ that the coition really
takes place.
7 Crustaceans copulate/ as the crawfish, the lobster, the
carid and the like, just like the opisthuretic quadrupeds, 20
when the one animal turns up its tail and the other puts
his tail on the other’s tail. Copulation takes place in the
early spring, near to the shore ; and, in fact, the process
has often been observed in the case of all these animals.6
Sometimes it takes place about the time when the figs
begin to ripen. Lobsters and carids copulate in like 25
manner.
Crabs copulate7 at the front parts of one another, belly
to belly, throwing their overlapping 8 opercula to meet one
another: first the smaller crab mounts the larger at the
rear; after he has mounted, the larger one turns on one
side. Now, the female differs9 in no respect from the 30
male except in the circumstance that its operculum is
larger, more elevated, and more hairy, and into this oper¬
culum it spawns its eggs and in the same neighbourhood is
the outlet of the residuum. In the copulative process of

these animals there is no protrusion of a member from one
animal into the other.
Insects 1 2 copulate at the hinder end,“ and the smaller 8
542H individuals mount the larger; and the smaller individual is
the male. The female pushes from underneath her sexual
organ into the body of the male above, this being the
reverse of the operation observed in other creatures ;3 and
this organ in the case of some insects appears to be dispro¬
portionately large when compared to the size of the body,
5 and that too in very minute creatures; in some insects the
disproportion is not so striking. This phenomenon may be
witnessed if any one will pull asunder flies that are copulat¬
ing ; and, by the way, these creatures are, under the circum¬
stances, averse to separation ; for the intercourse of the
sexes in their case is of long duration, as may be observed
io with common everyday insects, such as the fly and the can
tharis. They all copulate in the manner above described,
the fly, the cantharis, the sphondyle,4 [the phalangium
spider] 5 * and any others of the kind that copulate at all.
The phalangia G—that is to say, such of the species as spin
webs—perform the operation in the following way: the
female takes hold of the suspended web at the middle and
gives a pull, and the male gives a counter pull; this opera
15 tion they repeat until they are drawn in together and
interlaced at the hinder ends; for, by the way, this mode
of copulation suits them in consequence of the rotundity of
their stomachs.7
So much for the modes of sexual intercourse in all
animals; but, with regard to the same phenomenon, there
are definite laws followed as regards the season of the year
and the age of the animal.
20 Animals in general seem naturally disposed to this inter

course at about the same period of the year, and that is
when winter is changing into summer. And this is the
season of spring, in which almost all things that fly or walk
or swim take to pairing. Some animals pair and breed
in autumn also and in winter, as is the case with cer- 25
tain aquatic animals and certain birds. Man pairs and
breeds at all seasons, as is the case also with domesticated
animals, owing to the shelter and good feeding they enjoy:
that is to say, with those whose period of gestation is also
comparatively brief, as the sow and the bitch, and with those
birds that breed frequently. Many animals time the season 30
of intercourse with a view to the right nurture subsequently
of their young. In the human species, the male is more under
sexual excitement in winter, and the female in summer. 542
With birds the far greater part, as has been said, pair
and breed during the spring and early summer, with the
exception of the halcyon.
The halcyon 1 breeds at the season of the winter solstice.
Accordingly, when this season is marked with calm 5
weather,2 the name of * halcyon days ’ is given to the seven
days preceding, and to as many following, the solstice ; as
Simonides the poet says :
God lulls for fourteen days the winds to sleep
In winter ; and this temperate interlude
Men call the Holy Season, when the deep
Cradles the mother Halcyon and her brood. 10
And these days are calm, when southerly winds prevail at
the solstice, northerly ones having been the accompaniment
of the Pleiads. The halcyon is said to take seven days for
building her nest, and the other seven for laying and
hatching her eggs.3 In our country there are not always
halcyon days about the time of the winter solstice, but in 15
the Sicilian seas this season of calm is almost periodical.
The bird lays about five eggs.

| The aithyia, or diver, and the lams, or gull, lay their 9
eggs on rocks1 bordering on the sea, two or three at a time ;
but the gull lays in the summer, and the diver at the
beginning of spring, just after the winter solstice, and it
20 broods 2 over its eggs as birds do in general. And neither
of these birds resorts to a hiding-place.] 3
The halcyon is the most rarely seen of all birds. It is
seen only about the time of the setting of the Pleiads and
the winter solstice. When ships are lying at anchor in
the roads, it will hover about a vessel and then disappear
25 in a moment, and Stesichorus in one of his poems alludes
to this peculiarity.4 The nightingale also breeds at the
beginning of summer, and lays five or six eggs; from
autumn until spring it retires to a hiding-place.
Insects copulate and breed in winter also, that is when
the weather is fine and south winds prevail ; such, I mean,
30 as do not hibernate, as the fly and the ant. The greater
part of wild animals bring forth once and once only in
the year, except in the case of animals like the hare,
where the female can become superfoetally impregnated.
5 In like manner the great majority of fishes breed only
543a once a year,0 like the shoal-fishes (or, in other words, such
as are caught in nets), the tunny, the pelamys, the grey
mullet, the chalcis, the mackerel,7 the sciaena, the psetta 8
and the like, with the exception of the labrax or basse ;
for this fish (alone amongst those mentioned) breeds twice 0
a year, and the second brood is the weaker of the two.

The trichias 1 and the rock-fishes breed twice a year; the
red mullet breeds thrice a year,2 and is exceptional in this 5
respect. This conclusion in regard to the red mullet is
inferred from the spawn ; for the spawn of the fish may
be seen in certain places at three different times of the
year.3 The scorpaena breeds twice a year.4 The sargue
breeds twice, in the spring and in the autumn.5 The saupe
breeds once a year only, in the autumn.0 The female tunny
breeds only once a year, but owing to the fact that the
fish in some cases spawn early and in others late, it looks
as though the fish bred twice over.7 The first spawning io
takes place in December before the solstice, and the latter
spawning in the spring. The male tunny differs from the
female in being unprovided with the fin beneath the belly
which is called aphareus.8
io Of cartilaginous fishes, the rhina or angel-fish is the only
one that breeds twice;9 for it breeds at the beginning of
autumn, and at the setting of the Pleiads : and, of the 15
two seasons, it is in better condition in the autumn. It
engenders at a birth seven or eight young. Certain of the

dog-fishes, for example the spotted dog, seem to breed
twice a month, and this results from the circumstance that
the eggs do not all reach maturity at the same time.
Some fishes breed at all seasons, as the muraena. This
20 animal lays a great number of eggs at a time; and the
young when hatched are very small but grow with great
rapidity, like the young of the hippurus, for these fishes
from being diminutive at the outset grow with exceptional
rapidity to an exceptional size.1 [Be it observed that the
muraena breeds at all seasons, but the hippurus only in
the spring. The smyrus differs from the smyraena; for
25 the muraena is mottled and weakly, whereas the smyrus is
strong and of one uniform colour, and the colour resembles
that of the pine-tree,2 and the animal has teeth inside and
out.3 They say that in this case, as in other similar ones,
the one is the male, and the other the female, of a single
species. They come out on to the land,4 and are frequently
caught.]5 *
30 Fishes, then, as a general rule, attain their full growth
with great rapidity, but this is especially the case, among
small fishes, with the coracine or crow-fish:c it spawns, by
543b the way, near the shore, in weedy and tangled spots. The
orphus also, or sea-perch, is small at first, and rapidly
attains a great size.7 The pelamys and the tunny breed

in the Euxine, and nowhere else. The cestreus or mullet,1
the chrysophrys or gilt-head, and the labrax or basse, breed
best where rivers run into the sea. The orcys2 or large- 5
sized tunny, the scorpis,3 and many other species spawn in
the open sea.
11 Fish for the most part breed some time or other during the
three months between the middle of March and the middle
of June.4 5 Some few breed in autumn: as, for instance, the
saupe and the sargus, and such others of this sort as breed
shortly before the autumn equinox ; likewise the electric
ray and the angel-fish. Other fishes breed both in winter 10
and in summer, as was previously observed : as, for instance,
in winter-time the basse, the grey mullet, and the belone or
pipe-fish ; and in summer-time, from the middle of June to
the middle of July, the female tunny, about the time of the
summer solstice ;r> and the tunny lays a sac-like enclosure in
which are contained a number of small eggs.6 The ryades
or shoal-fishes breed in summer.
Of the grey mullets,7 the chelon8 begins to be in roe
between the middle of November and the middle of 15
December; as also the sargue, and the smyxon or myxon,
and the cephalus ; and their period of gestation is thirty
days. And, by the way, some of the grey mullet species are

not produced from copulation, but grow spontaneously from
mud and sand.1
As a general rule, then, fishes are in roe in the spring
20 time; while some, as has been said, are so in summer, in
autumn, or in winter. But whereas the impregnation in
the spring-time follows a general law, impregnation in
the other seasons does not follow the same rule either
throughout or within the limits of one genus ; and, further,
conception in these variant seasons is not so prolific. And,
indeed, we must bear this in mind, that just as with plants
25 and quadrupeds diversity of locality has much to do not
only with general physical health but also with the com¬
parative frequency of sexual intercourse and generation, so
also with regard to fishes locality of itself has much to do
not only in regard to the size and vigour of the creature,
but also in regard to its parturition and its copulations,
30 causing the same species to breed oftener in one place and
seldomer in another.
544a The molluscs also breed in spring. Of the marine mol¬
luscs one of the first to breed is the sepia. It spawns at all
times of the day2 and its period of gestation is fifteen
days.3 After the female has laid her eggs, the male comes
and discharges the milt 4 over the eggs, and the eggs there¬
upon harden. And the two sexes of this animal go about
5 in pairs, side by side ; and the male is more mottled and
more black on the back than the female.5
The octopus pairs in winter and breeds in spring, lying
hidden for about twTo months. Its spawn is shaped
like a vine-tendril,0 and resembles the fruit of the w'hite
poplar; the creature is extraordinarily prolific, for the
10 number of individuals that come from the spawn is some¬
thing incalculable. The male differs from the female in the
fact that its head is longer, and that the organ called by

the fishermen its penis, in the tentacle, is white.1 The
female, after laying her eggs, broods over them, and in
consequence gets out of condition, by reason of not going
in quest of food during the hatching period.
The purple murex breeds about spring-time, and the 15
ceryx at the close of the winter. And, as a general rule,
the testaceans are found to be furnished with their so-called
eggs 2 in springtime and in autumn, with the exception of
the edible urchin; for this animal has the so-called eggs
in most abundance in these seasons, but at no season is
unfurnished with them; and it is furnished with them in
especial abundance in warm weather or when a full moon is 20
in the sky.3 Only, by the way, these remarks do not apply
to the sea-urchin found in the Pyrrhaean Straits,4 for this
urchin is at its best for table purposes in the winter;5 and
these urchins are small but full of eggs.
Snails are found by observations to become in all cases
impregnated about the same season.0
13 7 [Of birds the wild species, as has been stated, as a general 25
rule pair and breed only once a year. The swallow, how¬
ever, and the blackbird breed twice. With regard to the
b lackbird, however, its first brood is killed by inclemency
of weather (for it is the earliest of all birds to breed), but
the second brood it usually succeeds in rearing.
Birds that are domesticated or that are capable of
domestication breed frequently, just as the common pigeon 3°
breeds all through the summer, and as is seen in the barn¬
door hen; for the barn-door cock and hen have intercourse,
and the hen breeds, at all seasons alike: excepting, by the
way, during the days about the winter solstice.8

 HISTORTA ANIMAL IUM

Of the pigeon family there are many diversities -,1 for the
peristera or common pigeon is not identical with the peleias
or rock-pigeon. In other words, the rock-pigeon is smaller
than the common pigeon, and is less easily domesticated ;
it is also black, and small, red-footed and rough-footed ;
and in consequence of these peculiarities it is neglected by
5 the pigeon fancier. The largest of all the pigeon species
is the phatta or ring-dove ; and the next in size is the
oenas or stock-dove ;2 and the stock-dove is a little larger
than the common pigeon. The smallest of all the species
is the turtle-dove. Pigeons breed and hatch at all seasons,
if they are furnished with a sunny place and all requisites;
unless they are so furnished, they breed only in the summer.
10 The spring brood is the best, or the autumn brood. At all
events, without doubt, the produce of the hot season, the
summer brood, is the poorest of the three.]
Further, animals differ from one another in regard to the 14
time of life that is best adapted for sexual intercourse.
To begin with, in most animals the secretion of the
seminal fluid and its generative capacity are not phenomena
simultaneously manifested, but manifested successively.
15 Thus, in all animals, the earliest secretion of sperm is
unfruitful,3 or if it be fruitful the issue is comparatively
poor and small. And this phenomenon is especially
observable in man, in viviparous quadrupeds, and in birds;
for in the case of man and the quadruped the offspring is
smaller, and in the case of the bird, the egg.
For animals that copulate, of one and the same species,
20 the age for maturity is in most species4 tolerably uniform,
unless it occurs prematurely by reason of abnormality, or
is postponed by physical injury.
In man. then, maturity is indicated by a change of the

tone of voice,1 by an increase in size and an alteration in
appearance of the sexual organs, as also in an increase of
size and alteration in appearance of the breasts ; and above
all, in the hair-growth at the pubes. Man begins to possess 25
seminal fluid about the age of fourteen, and becomes
generatively capable at about the age of twenty-one years.
In other animals there is no hair-growth at the pubes
(for some animals have no hair at all, and others have none
on the belly, or less on the belly than on the back), but
still, in some animals the change of voice is quite obvious ; 30
and in some animals other organs give indication of the
commencing secretion of the sperm and the onset of
generative capacity. As a general rule the female is
sharper-toned in voice than the male, and the young
animal than the elder ;2 for, by the way, the stag has 545**
a much deeper-toned bay than the hind. Moreover, the
male cries chiefly at rutting time, and the female under
terror and alarm ; and the cry of the female is short, and
that of the male prolonged. With dogs also, as they grow 5
old, the tone of the bark gets deeper.
There is a difference observable also in the neighings of
horses. That is to say, the female foal has a thin small
neigh, and the male foal a small neigh, yet bigger and
deeper-toned than that of the female, and a louder one as
time goes on. And when the young male and female are
two years old and take to breeding, the neighing of the 10
stallion becomes loud and deep, and that of the mare louder
and shriller than heretofore; and this change goes on until
they reach the age of about twenty years ; and after this
time the neighing in both sexes becomes weaker and
weaker.
As a rule, then, as was stated, the voice of the male
differs from the voice of the female, in animals where the 15
voice admits of a continuous and prolonged sound, in the
fact that the note in the male voice is more deep and bass;
not, however, in all animals, for the contrary holds good in

the case of some, as for instance in kine: for here the cow
has a deeper note than the bull, and the calves a deeper
note than the cattle.1 And we can thus understand the
20 change of voice in animals that undergo gelding; 2 for male
animals that undergo this process assume the characters of
the female.
The following are the ages at which various animals
become capacitated for sexual commerce. The ewe and
the she-goat are sexually mature when one year old, and
this statement is made more confidently in respect to the
25 she-goat than to the ewe; the ram and the he-goat are
sexually mature at the same age. The progeny of very
young individuals among these animals differs from that of
other males : for the males improve in the course of the
second year, when they become fully mature.3 The boar
and the sow are capable of intercourse when eight months
old, and the female brings forth when one year old, the
difference corresponding to her period of gestation. The
30 boar is capable of generation when eight months old, but,
with a sire under a year in age, the litter is apt to be a poor
one. The ages, however, are not invariable ; now and then
545b the boar and the sow are capable of intercourse when four
months old, and are capable of producing a litter which can
be reared when six months old; but at times the boar
begins to be capable of intercourse when ten months. He
continues sexually mature until he is three years old. The
dog and the bitch are, as a rule, sexually capable and
sexually receptive when a year old, and sometimes when
5 eight months old ;4 but the priority in date is more
common with the dog than with the bitch. The period of

 BOOK V. 14 545b
gestation with the bitch is sixty days, or sixty-one, or sixty
two, or sixty-three at the utmost; the period is never under
sixty days, or, if it is, the litter comes to no good. The
bitch, after delivering a litter, submits to the male in six
months, but not before. The horse and the mare are, at 10
the earliest, sexually capable and sexually mature when
two 1 years old ; the issue, however, of parents of this age
is small and poor. As a general rule these animals are
sexually capable when three years old, and they grow better
for breeding purposes until they reach twenty years. The 15
stallion is sexually capable up to the age of thirty-three
years, and the mare up to forty,2 so that, in point of fact,
the animals are sexually capable all their lives long ; for
the stallion, as a rule, lives for about thirty-five years,
and the mare for a little over forty ;3 although, by the way,
a horse has been known to live to the age of seventy-five. 20
The ass and the she-ass are sexually capable when thirty
months old ; but, as a rule, they are not generatively
mature until they are three years old, or three years and
a half. An instance has been known of a she-ass bearing
and bringing forth a foal when only a year old. A cow has
been known to calve when only a year old, and the calf
grew as big as might be expected, but no more. So much 25
for the dates in time at which these animals attain to
generative capacity.
In the human species, the male is generative, at the
longest, up to seventy years, and the female up to fifty ;
but such extended periods are rare. As a rule, the male is
generative up to the age of sixty-five, and to the age of 30
forty-five the female is capable of conception.
The ewe bears up to eight years, and, if she be carefully
tended, up to eleven years; in fact, the ram and the ewe
are sexually capable pretty well all their lives long. He- 546s1
goats, if they be fat, are more or less unserviceable for
breeding ;4 and this, by the way, is the reason why country
folk say of a vine when it stops bearing that it is ‘ running

the goat V However, if an over-fat he-goat be thinned
down, he becomes sexually capable and generative.
Rams single out the oldest ewes for copulation, and
5 show no regard for the young ones. And, as has been
stated, the issue of the younger ewes is poorer than that of
the older ones.
The boar is good for breeding purposes until he is three
years of age ;1 2 but after that age his issue deteriorates,
for after that age his vigour is on the decline. The boar
is most capable after a good feed, and with the first sow it
io mounts ; if poorly fed or put to many females, the copula¬
tion is abbreviated,3 and the litter is comparatively poor.
The first litter of the sow is the fewest in number; at the
second litter she is at her prime. The animal, as it grows
old, continues to breed, but the sexual desire abates. When
they reach fifteen years, they become unproductive, and are
i5 getting old.4 If a sow be highly fed, it is all the more
eager for sexual commerce, whether old or young; but, if
it be over-fattened in pregnancy, it gives the less milk after
parturition. With regard to the age of the parents, the
litter is the best when they are in their prime ; but with
regard to the seasons of the year, the litter is the best that
comes at the beginning of winter ; and the summer litter
the poorest, consisting as it usually does of animals small
20 and thin and flaccid.5 The boar, if it be well fed, is
sexually capable at all hours, night and day ; but otherwise
is peculiarly salacious early in the morning. As it grows
old the sexual passion dies away, as we have already
remarked. Very often a boar, when more or less impotent
from age or debility, finding itself unable to accomplish the
sexual commerce with due speed, and growing fatigued
25 with the standing posture, will roll the sow over on the
ground, and the pair will conclude the operation side by
1 i.e. running riot in over-luxuriance. 2 Plin. viii. 51; Varro, R. R. ii. 4. 8 ; Columella, vii. 9. ;i Reading dXiyoxpoviwTtpa.

side of one another. The sow is sure of conception if it
drops its lugs in rutting time ;1 if the ears do not thus
drop, it may have to rut a second time before impregnation
takes place.
Bitches do not submit to the male throughout their
lives,2 but only until they reach a certain maturity of
years. As a general rule, they are sexually receptive and
conceptive until they are twelve years old; although, by
the way, cases have been known where dogs and bitches 3°
have been respectively procreative and conceptive to the
ages of eighteen and even of twenty years. But, as
a rule, age diminishes the capability of generation and of
conception with these animals as with all others.
The female of the camel is opisthuretic, and submits to 546b
the male in the way above described ;3 and the season for
copulation in Arabia is about the month of October. Its
period of gestation is twelve months;4 and it is never
delivered of more than one foal at a time. The female
becomes sexually receptive and the male sexually capable 5
at the age of three years. After parturition, an interval of
a year elapses before the female is again receptive to the
male.
The female 5 6 elephant becomes sexually receptive when
ten years old at the youngest, and when fifteen at the
oldest;G and the male is sexually capable when five years
old, or six. The season for intercourse is spring. The
male allows an interval of three years to elapse after com- 10
merce with a female : and, after it has once impregnated
a female, it has no intercourse with her again.7 The period
of gestation with the female is two years; and only one
young animal is produced at a time, in other words it is
uniparous. And the embryo is the size of a calf two or
three months old.8

So much for the copulations of such animals as copulate. 15
15 We now proceed to treat of generation both with respect
to copulating and non-copulating animals, and we shall
commence with discussing the subject of generation in the
case of the testaceans.
The testacean 1 is almost the only genus that throughout
all its species is non-copulative.
The porphyrae, or purple murices, gather together to
some one place in the spring-time, and deposit the so-called
c honey-comb \2 This substance resembles the comb, only
20 that it is not so neat and delicate; and looks as though
a number of husks of white chick-peas were all stuck
together. But none of these structures has any open
passage, and the porphyra does not grow out of them, but
these and all other testaceans grow out of mud and
decaying matter. The substance, is, in fact, an excretion
25 of the porphyra and the ceryx ; for it is deposited by the
ceryx as well. Such, then, of the testaceans as deposit the
honeycomb are generated spontaneously like all other
testaceans, but they certainly come in greater abundance
in places where their congeners have been living previously.3
At the commencement of the process of depositing the
honeycomb, they throw off a slippery mucus, and of this
30 the husklike formations are composed. These formations,
then, all melt and deposit their contents4 on the ground,
and at this spot there are found on the ground a number
of minute porphyrae, and porphyrae are caught at times
with these animalculae upon them, some of which are too
547a small to be differentiated in form. If the porphyrae are
caught before producing this honey-comb, they sometimes
go through the process in fishing-creels, not here and there
in the baskets, but gathering to some one spot all together,
just as they do in the sea; and owing to the narrowness of
their new quarters they cluster together like a bunch of
grapes.

 BOOK V. 15 547
There are many species of the purple murex ;1 and some
are large, as those found off Sigeum and Lectum ; others 5
are small, as those found in the Euripus, and on the coast
of Caria. And those that are found in bays are large and
rough; in most of them the peculiar bloom from which
their name is derived is dark to blackness, in others it is
reddish and small in size ; some of the large ones weigh
upwards of a mina apiece. But the specimens that are
found along the coast and on the rocks are small-sized, and 10
the bloom in their case is of a reddish hue. Further, as
a general rule, in northern waters the bloom is blackish,
and in southern waters of a reddish hue. The murex is
caught in the spring-time when engaged in the construction
of the honeycomb ; but it is not caught at any time about
the rising of the dog-star,2 for at that period it does not feed,
but conceals itself and burrows. The bloom of the animal 15
is situated between the mecon (or quasi-liver) and the neck,
and the co-attachment of these is an intimate one. In
colour it looks like a white membrane, and this is what
people extract; and if it be removed and squeezed it stains
your hand with the colour of the bloom. There is a kind
of vein that runs through it, and this quasi-vein would
appear to be in itself the bloom. And the qualities, by the
way, of this organ are astringent.3 It is after the murex 20
has constructed the honey-comb that the bloom is at its
worst. Small specimens they break in pieces, shells and
all, for it is no easy matter to extract the organ ; but in
dealing with the larger ones they first strip off the shell
and then abstract the bloom. For this purpose the neck
and mecon are separated, for the bloom lies in between
them, above the so-called stomach ; hence the necessity of 25
1 e.g. M. brandaris, M. trunculus, Purpura haemastoma, &c. The first is still called at Tarento quecciolo a far la porpora (Costa). The great refuse-heaps of shells at Tarento consist of M. brandaris, at Tyre of M. trunculus. On the species of nopfyvpa cf. Plin. ix. 61, Athen. iii. 88 ; also Fabius Columna, dePurpura, 1674; J. G. Schneider in Ulloa’s Nachrichten von A7nerica> 1781, vol. ii. p. 377 ; Heusinger, de Purp. antiquorum, Wurzburg, 1826; Martens, op. cit. p. 205; Lacaze Duthiers, ‘ Nat.

separating them in abstracting the bloom. Fishermen are
anxious always to break the animal in pieces while it is
yet alive,1 for, if it die before the process is completed,
it vomits out the bloom ; and for this reason the fishermen
keep the animals in creels, until they have collected a
sufficient number and can attend to them at their leisure.
Fishermen in past times used not to lower creels or attach
30 them to the bait, so that very often the animal got dropped
off in the pulling up ; at present, however, they always
attach a basket,2 so that if the animal fall off it is not lost.
The animal is more inclined to slip off the bait if it be full
inside; if it be empty it is difficult to shake it off. Such
547b are the phenomena connected with the porphyra or murex.
The same phenomena are manifested by the ceryx or
trumpet-shell ; and the seasons are the same in which the
phenomena are observable. 3 Both animals, also, the murex
and the ceryx, have their opercula similarly situated4—and,
in fact, all the stromboids, and this is congenital with them
5 all; and they feed by protruding the so-called tongue
underneath the operculum. The tongue of the murex is
bigger than one’s finger, and by means of it, it feeds, and
perforates conchylia and the shells of its own kind.5 6 Both
the murex and the ceryx are long-lived. The murex lives
10 for about six years ; and the yearly increase is indicated
by a distinct interval in the spiral convolution of the shell.'"
The mussel also constructs a honey-comb.7

them beginning to grow.9 Cockles and clams and razor

fishes and scallops grow spontaneously in sandy places.
The pinna grows straight up from its tuft of anchoring
fibres 1 in sandy and slimy places;2 these creatures have
inside them a parasite nicknamed the pinna-guard,3 in some
cases a small carid 4 and in other cases a little crab;5 if
the pinna be deprived of this pinna-guard it soon dies.
As a general rule, then, all testaceans grow by spon¬
taneous generation in mud, differing from one another
according to the differences of the material ; oysters
growing in slime, and cockles and the other testaceans
above mentioned on sandy bottoms; and in the hollows
of the rocks the ascidian and the barnacle, and common
sorts,6 such as the limpet and the nerites. All these
animals grow with great rapidity, especially the murex and
the scallop; for the murex and the scallop attain their
full growth in a year. In some of the testaceans white
crabs are found, very diminutive in size; they are most
numerous in the trough-shaped7 mussel. In the pinna
also is found the so-called pinna-guard. They are found
also in the scallop and in the oyster; these parasites never
appear to grow in size. Fishermen declare that the para¬
site is congenital with the larger animal. [Scallops burrow
for a time in the sand, like the murex.]8
[Shell-fish, then, grow in the way above mentioned ; and
avro'LS. On the cultivation of oysters cf. Plin. ix. 51, Xenocr. de Aq. 26. 1 It is a moot point whether to read Ac rod fivcrcrod, ‘out of deep water’, or rtjs fivcrcrov, ‘from its byssus, or tuft of anchoring fibres.’ The latter is the characteristic feature of the Pinna, and it accords with Gaza’s translation, ‘ pinnae erectae ex bysso, id est villo sive lana ilia pinnali ’: the former with Athenaeus iii. 89 Ac roC /3vdod. On the ground that the word ftvaaos is not used in ancient Greek, Sylburg, Camus, A. and W., and Dittm. accept Ac rod fivo-aod; I prefer the other alternative, chiefly on the ground that the pinna does grow ‘ straight up out of its byssus ’, but, though it lives in deep water, can¬ not be said to ‘grow up out of it’.

some of them grow in shallow water,1 some on the sea¬
shore, some in rocky places,2 some on hard and stony
ground, and some in sandy places.]3 Some shift about
from place to place, others remain permanent on one spot.
Of those that keep to one spot the pinnae are rooted to
5 the ground ; the razor-fish and the clam keep to the same
locality, but are not so rooted ; but still, if forcibly removed
they die.4
[The star-fish is naturally so warm that whatever it lays
hold of is found, when suddenly taken away from the
animal, to have undergone a process like boiling.5 Fisher¬
men say that the star-fish is a great pest in the Strait of
io Pyrrha. In shape it resembles a star as seen in an ordinary
drawing. The so-called ‘ lungs ’ are generated spontaneously.
The shells that painters use are a good deal thicker, and
the bloom is outside the shell on the surface. These
creatures are mostly found on the coast of Caria.]6
15 The hermit-crab 7 grows spontaneously out of soil and
slime, and finds its way into untenanted shells. As it
grows it shifts to a larger shell, as for instance into the
shell of the nerites, or of the strombus or the like, and very
often into the shell of the small ceryx. After entering a new
20 shell, it carries it about, and begins again to feed, and, by
and by, as it grows, it shifts again into another larger one.
Moreover, the animals that are unfurnished with shells 16
grow spontaneously, like the testaceans, as, for instance, the
sea-nettles and the sponges in rocky caves.
Of the sea-nettle,8 or sea-anemone, there are two species ;
25 and of these one species lives in hollows and never loosens
its hold upon the rocks, and the other lives on smooth flat
reefs, free and detached, and shifts its position from time to

time. [Limpets also detach themselves, and shift from
place to place.]1
In the chambered cavities of sponges pinna-guards or
parasites are found.2 And over the chambers there is
a kind of spider’s web, by the opening and closing of which
they catch minute fishes ; that is to say, they open the 30
web to let the fish get in, and close it again to entrap
them.3
Of sponges there are three species ;4 * * * the first is of loose
porous texture, the second is close-textured, the third,
which is nicknamed c the sponge of Achilles ’, is exception- 548b
ally fine and close-textured and strong. This sponge is
used as a lining to helmets and greaves, for the purpose of
deadening the sound of the blow ; and this is a very scarce
species. Of the close-textured sponges such as are par¬
ticularly hard and rough are nicknamed ‘ goats 5
Sponges grow spontaneously either attached to a rock
or on sea-beaches, and they get their nutriment in slime:
a proof of this statement is the fact that when they are
first secured they are found to be full of slime. This is
characteristic of all living creatures that get their nutriment
by close local attachment. And, by the way, the close
textured sponges are weaker than the more openly porous
ones because their attachment extends over a smaller
area. 10
It is said that the sponge is sensitive ; and as a proof of
this statement they say that if the sponge is made aware of
an attempt being made to pluck it from its place of attach¬
ment it draws itself together, and it becomes a difficult task
to detach it. It makes a similar contractile movement in

tightening its hold. Some persons express doubts as to

the truth of this assertion; as, for instance, the people of
15 Toronc.
The sponge breeds parasites, worms, and other creatures,
on which, if they be detached, the rock-fishes prey, as they
prey also on the remaining stumps of the sponge ;1 but, if
the sponge be broken off, it grows again from the remaining
stump and the place is soon as well covered as before.
The largest of all sponges are the loose-textured ones,
and these are peculiarly abundant on the coast of Lycia.
20 The softest are the close-textured sponges ; for, by the way,
the so-called sponges of Achilles are harder than these.
As a general rule, sponges that are found in deep calm
waters are the softest; for usually windy and stormy
weather has a tendency to harden them (as it has to
harden all similar growing things), and to arrest their
growth. And this accounts for the fact that the sponges
found in the Hellespont are rough and close-textured ;
25 and, as a general rule, sponges found beyond or inside
Cape Malea are, respectively, comparatively soft or com¬
paratively hard. But, by the way, the habitat of the
sponge should not be too sheltered and warm, for it has
a tendency to decay, like all similar vegetable-like growths.
And this accounts for the fact that the sponge is at its best
when found in deep water close to shore ; for owing to the
depth of the water they enjoy shelter alike from stormy
winds and from excessive heat.
Whilst they are still alive and before they are washed
30 and cleaned, they are blackish in colour. Their attachment
is not made at one particular spot, nor is it made all over
their bodies; for vacant pore-spaces intervene. There is
a kind of membrane stretched over the under parts ; and in
the under parts the points of attachment are the more
54ga numerous. On the top most of the pores are closed, but
four or five are open and visible; and we are told by some
that it is through these pores that the animal takes its
food.

 BOOK V. 16 549
There is a particular species1 that is named the ‘aplysia’2
or the ‘ unwashable from the circumstance that it cannot
be cleaned. This species has the large open and visible 5
pores, but all the rest of the body is close-textured ; and, if
it be dissected, it is found to be closer and more glutinous
than the ordinary sponge, and, in a word, something lung¬
like in consistency. And, on all hands, it is allowed that
this species is sensitive and long-lived. They are distin¬
guished in the sea from ordinary sponges from the circum- to
stance that the ordinary sponges are white while the slime
is in them,3 but that these sponges are under any circum¬
stances black.
And so much with regard to sponges and to generation
in the testaceans.
17 Of crustaceans, the female crawfish after copulation con¬
ceives and retains its eggs for about three months, from 15
about the middle of May to about the middle of August;
they then lay the eggs into the folds underneath the belly,
and their eggs grow like grubs. This same phenomenon
is observable in molluscs also, and in such fishes as are
oviparous ; for in all these cases the egg continues to grow. 20
The spawn of the crawfish4 is of a loose or granular
consistency, and is divided into eight parts; for corre¬
sponding to each of the flaps on the side there is a gristly
formation 5 to which the spawn is attached, and the entire
structure resembles a cluster of grapes; for each gristly
formation is split into several parts. This is obvious enough
if you draw the parts asunder; but at first sight the whole 25
appears to be one and indivisible. And the largest are not
those nearest to the outlet but those in the middle, and the
farthest off are the smallest. The size of the small eggs is
that of a small seed in a fig; and they are not quite close
to the outlet, but placed middleways; for at both ends,
tailwards and trunkwards, there are two intervals devoid of ?,o

eggs ; for it is thus that the flaps also grow. The side
flaps, then, cannot close, but by placing the end flap on
them the animal can close up all, and this end-flap serves
549b them for a lid. And in the act of laying its eggs it seems
to bring them towards the gristly formations 1 by curving
the flap of its tail, and then, squeezing the eggs towards the
said gristly formations2 and maintaining a bent posture, it
performs the act of laying. The gristly formations at these
seasons increase in size and become receptive of the eggs;
5 for the animal lays its eggs into these formations, just as
the sepia lays its eggs among twigs and driftwood.
It lays its eggs, then, in this manner, and after hatching
them for about twenty days it rids itself of them all in one
solid lump, as is quite plain from outside. And out of
these eggs crawfish form in about fifteen days, and these
io crawfish are caught at times less then a finger’s breadth,
or seven-tenths of an inch, in length. The animal, then,
lays its eggs before the middle of September, and after the
middle of that month throws off its eggs in a lump. With
the humped carids or prawns the time for gestation is four
months or thereabouts.
Crawfish are found in rough and rocky places, lobsters
in smooth places, and neither crawfish nor lobsters are
15 found in muddy ones ; and this accounts for the fact that
lobsters are found in the Hellespont and on the coast of
Thasos, and crawfish in the neighbourhood of Sigeum and
Mount Athos. Fishermen, accordingly, when they want to
catch these various creatures out at sea, take bearings on
the beach and elsewhere that tell them where the ground
at the bottom is stony and where soft with slime. In
20 winter and spring these animals keep in near to land, in
summer they keep in deep water; thus at various times
seeking respectively for warmth or coolness.
The so-called arctus or bear-crab lays its eggs at about
the same time as the crawfish; and consequently in winter
and in the spring-time, before laying their eggs, they are at
25 their best, and after laying at their worst.

They cast their shell in the spring-time (just as serpents
shed their so-called ‘ old-age ’ or slough), both directly after
birth and in later life; this is true both of crabs and craw¬
fish. And, by the way, all crawfish are longlived.
18 Molluscs, after pairing and copulation, lay a white spawn ; 30
and this spawn, as in the case of the testacean, gets granular
in time. The octopus discharges into its hole,1 or into a
potsherd or into any similar cavity, a structure resembling
the tendrils of a young vine or the fruit of the white poplar,
as has been previously observed.2 The eggs, when the
female has laid them, are clustered round the sides of the
hole. They are so numerous that, if they be removed, 550
they suffice to fill a vessel much larger than the
animal’s body3 in which they were contained. Some
fifty days later, the eggs burst and the little polypuses
creep out, like little spiders, in great numbers ; the charac- 5
teristic form of their limbs is not yet to be discerned in
detail, but their general outline is clear enough. And, by
the way, they are so small and helpless that the greater
number perish ; it is a fact that they have been seen so
extremely minute as to be absolutely without organization,
but nevertheless when touched they moved. The eggs of
the sepia 4 look like big black myrtle-berries, and they are ro
linked all together like a bunch of grapes,5 clustered round
a centre, and are not easily sundered from one another :
for the male exudes over them some moist glairy stuff,
which constitutes the sticky gum.G These eggs increase in
size ; and they are white at the outset, but black and larger 15
after the sprinkling of the male seminal fluid.
When it has come into being the young sepia is first
distinctly formed inside out of the white substance, and
when the egg bursts7 it comes out. The inner part is
formed as soon as 8 the female lays the egg, something like

a hail-stone ;1 and out of this substance the young sepia
grows by a head-attachment, just as young birds grow by
20 a belly-attachment. What is the exact nature of the
navel-attachment has not yet been observed, except that as
the young sepia grows the white substance grows less and
less in size, and at length, as happens with the yolk in the
case of birds, the white substance in the case of the young
sepia disappears. In the case of the young sepia, as in the

25 very large. To illustrate this by way of a figure, let A
represent the ovum, B and C the eyes, and D the sepidium,
or body of the little sepia.
The female sepia goes pregnant in the spring-time, and
lays its eggs after fifteen days of gestation; after the eggs
are laid there comes in another fifteen days something like
a bunch of grapes, and at the bursting of these the young
sepiae issue forth. But if, when the young ones are fully
30 formed, you sever the outer covering a moment too soon,

the young creatures eject excrement, and their colour 30
changes from white to red in their alarm.1
Crustaceans, then, hatch their eggs by brooding over
them as they carry them about beneath their bodies ; but 55°b
the octopus, the sepia, and the like hatch their eggs without
stirring from the spot where they may have laid them, and
this statement is particularly applicable to the sepia ; in
fact, the nest2 of the female sepia is often seen exposed to
view close in to shore. The female octopus at times sits
brooding over her eggs, and at other times squats in front 5
of her hole, stretching out her tentacles on guard.3
The sepia lays her spawn near to land in the neighbour¬
hood of sea-weed or reeds or any off-sweepings such as
brushwood, twigs, or stones; and fishermen place heaps of
faggots here and there on purpose, and on to such heaps
the female deposits a long continuous roe in shape like a 10
vine tendril.4 It lays or spirts out the spawn with an
effort, as though there were difficulty in the process. The
female calamary spawns at sea ; and it emits the spawn, as
does the sepia, in the mass.
The calamary and the cuttle-fish are short-lived, as, with
few exceptions, they never see the year out;5 and the 15
same statement is applicable to the octopus.
From one single egg comes one single sepia; and this is
likewise true of the young calamary.
The male calamary differs from the female ; for if its
gill-region 6 be dilated and examined there are found two

red formations resembling breasts,1 with which the male is
unprovided. In the sepia, apart from this distinction in the
20 sexes, the male, as has been stated,2 is more mottled than
the female.3
With regard to insects, that the male is less than the 19
female and that he mounts upon her back, and how he
performs the act of copulation and the circumstance that he
gives over reluctantly, all this has already been set forth ;4
25 in most cases of insect copulation 5 this process is speedily
followed up by parturition.
All insects engender grubs, with the exception of a species
of butterfly ; and the female of this species lays a hard egg,
resembling the seed of the cnecus,6 with a juice inside it.
But from the grub, the young animal does not grow out of
a mere portion of it, as a young animal grows from a portion
30 only of an egg, but the grub entire grows and the animal
becomes differentiated out of it.7
And of insects some are derived from insect congeners,
as the venom-spider8 and the common-spider from the
venom-spider and the common-spider, and so with the
attelabus or locust,9 the acris or grasshopper, and the tettix
55ia or cicada. Other insects are not derived from living
parentage, but are generated spontaneously : some out of
dew falling on leaves, ordinarily in spring-time, but not
seldom in winter when there has been a stretch of fair
weather and southerly winds ; others grow in decaying mud
5 or dung ; others in timber, green or dry; some in the hair of
animals; some in the flesh of animals; some in excrements :
and some from excrement after it has been voided, and some
from excrement yet within the living animal, like the helmin
thes or intestinal worms. And of these intestinal worms
there are three species : one named the flat-worm, another
1 H.A. iv. 1. 525s 1. 2 524b3o. 3 [ ], A. and W. Cf. 524b3o. 4 H. A. v. 8. 3 Dittm. transfers 6'an 6\(v(Tm to the next sentence.

the round worm, and the third the ascarid. These intestinal 10
worms do not in any case propagate their kind. The flat
worm, however, in an exceptional way, clings fast to the
gut, and lays a thing like a melon-seed,1 by observing
which indication the physician concludes that his patient is
troubled with the worm.
The so-called psyche or butterfly2 is generated from
caterpillars 3 which grow on green leaves, chiefly leaves of
the raphanus, which some call crambe or cabbage. At 15
first it is less than a grain of millet; it then grows into a
small grub ; and in three4 days it is a tiny caterpillar.
After this it grows on and on, and becomes quiescent and
changes its shape, and is now called a chrysalis. The
outer shell is hard, and the chrysalis moves if you touch it. 20
It attaches itself by cobweb-like filaments, and is unfurnished
with mouth or any other apparent organ. After a little while
the outer covering bursts asunder, and out flies the winged
creature that we call the psyche or butterfly. At first, when
it is a caterpillar, it feeds and ejects excrement; but when it
turns into the chrysalis it neither feeds nor ejects excrement. 25
The same remarks are applicable to all such insects as
are developed out of the grub, both such grubs as are
derived from the copulation of living animals and such as
* are generated without copulation on the part of parents.
For the grub of the bee, the anthrena, and the wasp, whilst
it is young, takes food and voids excrement ; but when it 55F
has passed from the grub shape to its defined form and
become what is termed a ‘ nympha ’, it ceases to take food
and to void excrement, and remains tightly wrapped up
and motionless until it has reached its full size, when it
breaks the formation with which the cell is closed, and 5
issues forth. The insects named the hypera and the penia 5

are derived from similar caterpillars, which move in an
undulatory way, progressing with one part and then pulling
up the hinder parts by a bend of the body.1 The developed
insect in each case takes its peculiar colour from the parent
caterpillar.
10 From one particular large grub, which has as it were
horns, and in other respects differs from grubs in general,
there comes, by a metamorphosis of the grub, first a
caterpillar, then the cocoon,2 then the necydalus; and the
creature passes through all these transformations within six
months. A class of women unwind and reel off the
cocoons of these creatures, and afterwards weave a fabric
15 with the threads thus unwound ; a Coan woman of the
name of Pamphila, daughter of Plateus, being credited with
the first invention of the fabric.3 After the same fashion
the carabus or stag-beetle 4 comes from grubs that live in
dry wood : at first the grub is motionless, but after a while
the shell bursts and the stag-beetle issues forth.
From the cabbage is engendered the cabbage-worm, and

grossitlariata.

Pliny indicates that the invention came from Assyria, and Latrcille, seeking for an Indian locality similar in name to Cos, found it in the island Cosmin, near Rangoon.

also winged. From the flat animalcule that skims 1 over
the surface of rivers comes the oestrus or gadfly ; and this
accounts for the fact that gadflies most abound in the
neighbourhood of waters on whose surface these animalcules
are observed.2 From a certain small, black and hairy
caterpillar comes first a wingless glow-worm ;3 and this
creature again suffers a metamorphosis, and transforms 25
into a winged insect named the bostrychus (or hair-curl).
Gnats grow from ascarids ; and ascarids are engendered
in the slime of wells, or in places where there is a deposit
left by the draining off of water. This slime decays, and
first turns white, then black, and finally blood-red ; and at 552a
this stage there originate in it, as it were, little tiny bits
of red weed,4 which at first wriggle about all clinging
together, and finally break loose and swim in the water, and
are hereupon known as ascarids. After a few days they 5
stand straight up on the water motionless and hard, and by
and by the husk breaks off and the gnats are seen sitting
upon it, until the sun’s heat or a puff of wind sets them in
motion, when they fly away.5
With all grubs and all animals that break out from the
grub state, generation6 is due primarily to the heat of the to
sun or to wind.
Ascarids are more likely to be found, and grow with
unusual rapidity, in places where there is a deposit of a
mixed and heterogeneous kind, as in kitchens7 and in

Plin. xi. 34, xviii. 67. In some species the female is apterous and much the more brilliant; in others (e. g. Luciola italica) the winged male is much the brighter, and the female is very rare. 4 A. and W. conjecture crKooXrjKia. 5 The description applies to the ‘ blood-worm ’, or larva of Chironomus, a common gnat.

ploughed fields, for the contents of such places are disposed
to rapid putrefaction. In autumn, also, owing to the drying
up of moisture, they grow in unusual numbers.
15 The tick is generated from couch-grass. The cockchafer
comes from a grub that is generated in the dung of the
cow or the ass.1 Thecantharus or scarabcus rolls a piece of
dung into a ball, lies hidden within it during the winter,
and gives birth therein to small grubs, from which grubs
come new canthari.2 Certain winged insects also come
from the grubs that are found in pulse, in the same fashion
20 as in the cases described.
Flies grow from grubs in the dung that farmers have
gathered up into heaps: for those who are engaged in this
work assiduously gather up the compost, and this they
technically term ‘ working-up * the manure.3 The grub is
25 exceedingly minute4 to begin with; first—even at this
stage—it assumes a reddish colour, and then from a
quiescent state it takes on the power of motion, as though
born to it; it then becomes a small motionless grub ; it
then moves again, and again relapses into immobility; it
then comes out a perfect fly, and moves away under the
influence of the sun’s heat or of a puff of air. The myops 5 6
30 or horse-fly is engendered in timber. The orsodacna or
budbane is a transformed grub ; and this grub is engendered

pillars that are found on fig-trees or pear-trees or fir-trees
for on all these grubs are engendered—and also from
caterpillars found on the dog-rose ; and the cantharis takes
eagerly to ill-scented substances, from the fact of its having
been engendered in ill-scented woods. The conops comes
from a grub that is engendered in the slime of vinegar.1 5
2 And, by the way, living animals are found in substances
that are usually supposed to be incapable of putrefaction;
for instance, worms are found in long-lying snow ;3 and
snow of this description gets reddish in colour, and the
grub that is engendered in it is red, as might have been
expected, and it is also hairy. The grubs found in the
snows of Media are large and white ; and all such grubs
are little disposed to motion. In Cyprus, in places where 10
copper-ore is smelted, with heaps of the ore piled on day
after day, an animal is engendered in the fire,4 somewhat
larger than a bluebottle fly, furnished with wings, which
can hop or crawl through the fire. And the grubs and
these latter animals perish when you keep the one away
from the fire and the other from the snow. Now the 15
salamander 5 is a clear case in point, to show us that animals
do actually exist that fire cannot destroy ; for this creature,
so the story goes, not only walks through the fire but puts
it out in doing so*

bursting issues a winged quadruped. The insect lives and
flies about until the evening, but as the sun goes down it
pines away, and dies at sunset having lived just one day,
from which circumstance it is called the ephemeron.1
As a rule, insects that come from caterpillars and grubs
are held 2 at first by filaments resembling the threads of
25 a spider’s web.3
Such is the mode of generation of the insects above
enumerated.
The wasps that are nicknamed ‘ the ichneumons * (or 20
hunters), less in size, by the way, than the ordinary wasp,
kill spiders and carry off the dead bodies to a wall or
some such place with a hole in it ; this hole they smear
over with mud and lay their grubs inside it, and from the
30 grubs come the hunter-wasps.4 Some of the coleoptera
and of the small and nameless insects make small holes or
553a cells of mud on a wall or on a grave-stone, and there
deposit their grubs.5
6 With insects, as a general rule, the time of generation
from its commencement to its completion comprises three
or four weeks. With grubs and grub-like creatures the
time is usually three weeks, and in the oviparous insects7
as a rule four. But, in the case of oviparous insects, the
5 egg-formation comes at the close of seven days from
copulation, and during the remaining three weeks the
parent broods over and hatches its young; i. e. where this

Europe, which builds mud-cells in nooks of walls, usually within peasants’ cottages, and stores them with about eight spiders in each cell (Fabre, Souvenirs entomologiques, ser. iv. p. 1, 1891). r* Schneider suggests the little beetle Trichodes (Clerus) alvearius, which lays its eggs in the nests of mason-bees. 0 A. and W. reject the rest of this chapter and the next.

is the result of copulation, as in the case of the spider and
its congeners. As a rule, the transformations take place
in intervals of three or four days, corresponding to the io
lengths of interval at which the crises recur in intermittent
fevers.
So much for the generation of insects. Their death is
due to the shrivelling1 of their organs, just as the larger
animals die of old age. Winged insects die in autumn
from the shrinking of their wings. The myops dies from 15
dropsy in the eyes.2
21 With regard to the generation of bees different hypo¬
theses are in vogue. Some affirm that bees neither copu¬
late nor give birth to young, but that they fetch their
young.3 And some say that they fetch their young from
the flower of the callyntrum ;4 others assert that they 20
bring them from the flower of the reed, others, from the
flower of the olive. And in respect to the olive theory,
it is stated as a proof that, when the olive harvest is most
abundant, the swarms are most numerous.5 Others declare
that they fetch the brood of the drones from such things
as above mentioned, but that the working bees are
engendered by the rulers of the hive. 25
Now of these rulers there are two kinds:6 the better
kind is red in colour, the inferior kind is black and varie¬
gated ; the ruler is double the size of the working bee.
These rulers have the abdomen or part below the waist
half as large again, and they are called by some the
c mothers ’,7 from an idea that they bear or generate the

30 bees; and, as a proof of this theory of their motherhood,
they declare that the brood of the drones appears even
when there is no ruler-bee in the hive, but that the bees do
not appear in his absence. Others, again, assert that these
553 insects copulate, and that the drones are male and the bees
female.
The ordinary bee is generated in the cells of the comb,
but the ruler-bees in cells down below attached to the
comb, suspended from it,1 apart from the rest, six or seven
in number, and growing in a way quite different from the
mode of growth of the ordinary brood.
5 Bees 2 are provided with a sting, but the drones are not
so provided. The rulers3 are provided with stings, but
they never use them ; and this latter circumstance will
account for the belief of some people that they have no
stings at all.
Of bees there are various species.4 The best kind is 22
a little round mottled insect; another is long, and resembles
10 the anthrena; a third is black and flat-bellied, and is nick¬
named the ‘ robber ’; a fourth kind is the drone, the largest
of all, but stingless and inactive.5 And this proportionate
size of the drone explains why some bee-masters place
a net-work in front of the hives; for the network is put to
keep the big drones out while it lets the little bees go in.
Of the king bees there are, as has been stated, two kinds.
T5 In every hive there are more kings than one; and a hive
goes to ruin if there be too few kings, not because of
anarchy thereby ensuing, but, as we are told, because these
creatures contribute in some way to the generation of the
common bees. A hive will gro also to ruin if there be too
large a number of kings in it ; for the members of the hives
are thereby subdivided into too many separate factions.
20 Whenever the spring-time is late a-coming, and when
1 Cf. H. A. ix. 40. 624a 2 ; Colum.

 BOOK V. 22 553
there is drought and mildew, then the progeny of the hive
is small in number.1 But when the weather is dry they
attend to the honey, and in rainy weather their attention is
concentrated on the brood ;2 and this will account for the
coincidence of rich olive-harvests and abundant swarms.
The bees first work at the honeycomb, and then put the
pupae in it: by the mouth, say those who hold the theory 25
of their bringing them from elsewhere. After putting in
the pupae they put in the honey for subsistence, and this
they do in the summer and autumn; and, by the way, the
autumn honey is the better of the two.
The honeycomb is made from flowers, and the materials
for the wax 3 they gather from the resinous gum of trees,
while honey is distilled from dew, and is deposited chiefly
at the risings of the constellations or when a rainbow is in 30
the sky:4 and as a general rule there is no honey before
the rising of the Pleiads. [The bee, then, makes the wax
from flowers. The honey, however, it does not make, but
merely gathers what is deposited out of the atmosphere;5 554
and as a proof of this statement we have the known fact
that occasionally bee-keepers find the hives filled with
honey within the space of two or three days. Furthermore,
in autumn flowers are found, but honey, if it be withdrawn,
is not replaced; now, after the withdrawal of the original
honey, when no food or very little is in the hives, there 5
would be a fresh stock of honey, if the bees made it from
flowers.] 6 Honey, if allowed to ripen and mature, gathers
consistency; for at first it is like water and remains liquid
for several days.7 If it be drawn off during these days it
has no consistency; but it attains consistency in about

io twenty days. The taste of thyme-honey 1 is discernible at
once, from its peculiar sweetness and consistency.
The bee gathers from every flower that is furnished with
a calyx or cup, and from all other flowers that are sweet
tasted, without doing injury to any fruit ; and the juices of
the flowers it takes up with the organ that resembles
a tongue and carries off to the hive.
T5 Swarms are robbed of their honey on the appearance of
the wild fig.2 3 They produce the best larvae at the time
the honey is a-making. The bee carries wax and bees’
bread round its legs, but vomits the honey into the cell.
After depositing its young, it broods over it like a bird.
The grub when it is small lies slantwise in the comb," but
20 by and by rises up straight by an effort of its own and
takes food, and holds 4 on so tightly to the honeycomb
as actually to cling to it.
The young of bees and of drones is white, and from
the young come the grubs ; and the grubs grow into bees
and drones. The egg of the king bee is reddish in colour,
25 and its substance is about as consistent as thick honey ;
and from the first it is about as big as the bee that is
produced from it. From the young of the king bee there
is no intermediate stage, it is said, of the grub, but the
bee comes at once.5
Whenever the bee lays an egg in the comb there is
always a drop of honey set against it. The larva of the
bee gets feet and wings as soon as the cell has been
stopped up with wax, and when it arrives at its com
554b pleted form it breaks its membrane and flies away. It
ejects excrement in the grub state, but not afterwards;
that is, not until it has got out of the encasing membrane,
as we have already described. If you remove the heads
from off the larvae before the coming of the wings, the
bees will eat them up; and if you nip off the wings from

a drone and let it go, the bees will spontaneously bite off 5
the wings from off all the remaining drones.
The bee lives for six years as a rule, as an exception for
seven years.1 If a swarm lasts for nine years, or ten, great
credit is considered due to its management.
In Pontus2 are found bees exceedingly white in colour,
and these bees produce their honey twice a month.3 (The
bees in Themiscyra, on the banks of the river Thermodon, 10
build honeycombs in the ground and in hives, and these
honeycombs are furnished with very little wax but with
honey of great consistency ; and the honeycomb, by the
way, is smooth and level.) But this is not always the case
with these bees, but only in the winter season ; for in Pontus
the ivy is abundant, and it flowers at this time of the year,
and it is from the ivy-flower that they derive their honey.
A white and very consistent honey is brought down from 15
the upper country to Amisus, which is deposited by bees on
trees4 without the employment of honeycombs :5 and this
kind of honey is produced in other districts in Pontus.
There are bees also that construct triple honeycombs in
the ground ; and these honeycombs supply honey but never
contain grubs.6 But the honeycombs in these places are 20
not all of this sort, nor do all the bees construct them.
23 Anthrenae7 and wasps construct combs for their

young.1 When they have no king, but are wandering about
in search of one, the anthrene constructs its comb on some
high place, and the wasp inside a hole. When the anthrene
25 and the wasp have a king, they construct their combs
underground. Their combs are in all cases hexagonal like
the comb of the bee. They are composed, however, not of
wax, but of a bark-like filamented 2 fibre, and the comb of
the anthrene is much neater than the comb of the wasp.
Like the bee, they put their young just like a drop of
555a liquid on to the side of the cell, and the egg clings to the
wall of the cell. But the eggs are not deposited in the
cells simultaneously; on the contrary, in some cells are
creatures big enough to fly, in others are nymphae, and in
others are mere grubs. As in the case of bees, excrement
is observed only in the cells where the grubs are found.
5 As long as the creatures are in the nymph condition they
are motionless, and the cell is cemented over. In the
comb of the anthrene there is found in the cell of the
young a drop of honey in front of it. The larvae of the
anthrene and the wasp make their appearance not in
the spring but in the autumn ; and their growth is especially
discernible in times of full moon. And, by thfc way, the
10 eggs and the grubs never rest at the bottom of the cells,
but always cling on to the side wall.
There is a kind of humble-bee3 that builds a cone-shaped 24
nest of clay against a stone or in some similar situation,
besmearing the clay with something like spittle.4 And

The description applies accurately to the mason-bee, Chalicodoma muraria (Latr.), save for the word o£u. The mason-bee’s nest is rounded, like half an orange. There is a solitary wasp, Eumencs coarctata, L., which builds a tiny, hard, one-celled nest of clay and spittle, conically pointed; but this insect does not resemble the humble-bee, nor has it any sort of ‘ honey¬ comb ’. 4 (TtdXa) A. and W., which is in accord with the facts.

this nest or hive is exceedingly thick and hard ; in point
of fact, one can hardly break it open with a spike.1 Here 15
the insects lay their eggs, and white grubs are produced
wrapped in a black membrane. Apart from the membrane
there is found some wax2 3 in the honeycomb ; and this wax
is much sallower in hue than the wax in the honeycomb of
the bee.
25 Ants copulate and engender grubs;:j and these grubs
attach themselves to nothing in particular, but grow on and 20
on from small and rounded shapes until they become elon¬
gated and defined in shape: and they are engendered in
spring-time.
26 The land-scorpion also lays a number of egg-shaped
grubs,4 and broods over them. When the hatching is
completed, the parent animal, as happens with the parent
spider, is ejected and put to death by the young ones ; for 25
very often the young ones are about eleven in number.
27 Spiders5 6 in all cases copulate in the way above men¬
tioned, and generate at first small grubs.0 And these
.
k
grubs metamorphose in their entirety, and not partially,
into spiders ; for, by the way, the grubs are round-shaped
at the outset. And the spider, when it lays its eggs,
broods over them, and in three days the eggs or grubs 55513
take definite shape.
All spiders lay their eggs in a web; but some spiders
lay in a small and fine web, and others in a thick one ; and
some, as a rule, lay in a round-shaped case or capsule, and
some are only partially enveloped in the web. The young
grubs are not all developed at one and the same time into
young spiders; but the moment the development takes
place, the young spider makes a leap and begins to spin his 5

web. The juice of the grub, if you squeeze it, is the same
as the juice found in the spider when young ; that is to say,
it is thick and white.
The meadow spider1 lays its eggs into a web, one half
of which is attached to itself2 and the other half is free;
and on this the parent broods until the eggs are hatched,
io The phalangia lay their eggs in a sort of strong basket
which they have woven, and brood over it until the eggs
are hatched. The smooth spider is much less prolific than
the phalangium or hairy spider. These phalangia, when
they grow to full size, very often envelop the mother
phalangium and eject and kill her; and not seldom they
kill the father-phalangium as well, if they catch him : for,
by the way, he has the habit of co-operating with the
15 mother in the hatching. The brood of a single phalangium
is sometimes three hundred in number. The spider attains
its full growth in about four weeks.
Grasshoppers3 (or locusts) copulate in the same way as 28
other insects ; that is to say, with the lesser covering the
20 larger, for the male is smaller than the female. The females
1 Lycosa sp. 2 npos avrats, or avrals, is not very intelligible, but the description seems somehow to refer to the gossamer webs which the field-spider shoots out, remains attached to, and is sometimes borne upon. 3 anpides, Lat. locustae (Plin. xi. 35, &c.), are grasshoppers, including locusts, but precise identification is not possible, either of axpis or aTTtXaftos, or of the many other kindred names in Greek, many of
. them obviously foreign, e. g. daipaKos (Diosc., cf. Talmud, NlpDX),
ftpovicos, pdara^, poXovpLs (Nic. Ther. 416, 802), Trdpvoy\r, Kopvoyjs, opxra?
(Hesych., Arab, (jbo/0,n^rqXi'y, rpco^aXis (Ael. vi. 19), &c. I am not sure that urrcXa/Sos in cap. 29 is not an interpolation, for Pliny’s account of locusta (/. c.) seems to embody the substance of both chapters. «rre'X«/3o? is a favourite word of Plutarch’s for the locust; cf. Plin. xxix. 29 ‘ locustarum minimae sine pennis, quos attelabos vocant ’: cf. Hesych., drreXa^of, dxp\s pucpd, and August, in Ps. 104 ‘ una plaga est locusta et bruchus, quoniam altera est parens et alter est foetus ’.

 BOOK V. 28 555b
first insert the hollow tube,1 which they have at their tails,
in the ground, and then lay their eggs: and the male, by
the way, is not furnished with this tube. The females lay
their eggs all in a lump together, and in one spot, so that
the entire lump of eggs resembles a honeycomb. After they
have laid their eggs, the eggs assume the shape of oval
grubs that are enveloped by a sort of thin clay, like
a membrane; in this membrane-like formation they grow 25
on to maturity. The larva is so soft that it collapses at
a touch. The larva is not placed on the surface of the
ground, but a little beneath the surface; and, when it
reaches maturity, it comes out of its clayey investiture in
the shape of a little black grasshopper; by and by, the
skin integument strips off,2 and it grows larger and larger.
The grasshopper lays its eggs at the close of summer,
and dies after laying them. The fact is that, at the time 55ba
of laying the eggs, grubs are engendered in the region of
the mother grasshopper’s neck ;3 and the male grasshop¬
pers die about the same time. In spring-time they come
out of the ground ; and, by the way, no grasshoppers are
found in mountainous land or in poor land, but only in
flat and loamy4 land, for the fact is they lay their eggs 5
in cracks of the soil. During the winter their eggs remain
in the ground ; and with the coming of summer the last
year’s larva develops into the perfect grasshopper.5
The attelabic or locusts lay their eggs and die in like
manner after laying them. Their eggs are subject to
1 It is doubtful whether we should read, with PDa, av\6u, or kuvXov with other MSS. and edd. The former is intrinsically probable, but Plin. (/. c.) has ‘ demisso spinae caule ’. Either word suggests a long ovipositor such as is found in the ‘green grasshoppers’, e.g. Locusta viridissimci, but not in the ordinary grasshoppers and locusts (Acridiidae): the latter insert the abdomen itself in the ground, making a hole by means of two little valvular appendages at its end, and the sexual difference is not obvious. While this particular observation may apply to one particular form, the rest of the chapter may well be of more general import. 2 Cf. H. A. viii. 17. 6oia 6.

destruction by the autumn rains, when the rains are un
io usually heavy; but in seasons of drought the locusts are
exceedingly numerous, from the absence of any destructive
cause, since their destruction seems then to be a matter of
accident and to depend on luck.
Of the cicada there are two kinds ;1 one, small in size,
15 the first to come and the last to disappear ; the other, large,
the singing one, that comes last and first disappears. Both
in the small and the large species some are divided at the
waist, to wit, the singing ones, and some are undivided;
and these latter have no song. The large and singing
cicada is by some designated the ‘ chirper ’, and the small
cicada the * tettigonium * or cicadelle. And, by the way,
20 such of the tettigonia as are divided at the waist can sing
just a little.
The cicada is not found where there are no trees; and
this accounts for the fact that in the district surrounding
the city of Cyrene it is not found at all in the plain
country, but is found in great numbers in the neighbourhood
of the city, and especially where olive-trees2 are growing:
for an olive grove is not thickly shaded. And the cicada is
not found in cold places, and consequently is not found in
any grove that keeps out the sunlight.3
2b The large and the small cicada copulate alike, belly to
belly. The male discharges sperm into the female,4 as is
the case with insects in general, and the female cicada has

They lay their eggs in fallow lands, boring a hole with
the pointed organ they carry in the rear,1 as do the
locusts likewise; for the locust lays its eggs in untilled 55bb
lands, and this fact may account for their numbers in the
territory adjacent to the city of Cyrene. The cicadae also
lay their eggs in the canes on which husbandmen prop
vines, perforating the canes; and also in the stalks of the
squill. This brood runs into the ground.2 And they are 5
most numerous in rainy weather. The grub, on attaining
full size in the ground, becomes a tettigometra (or nymph),
and the creature is sweetest to the taste 3 at this stage before
the husk is broken. When the summer solstice comes, the
creature issues from the husk at night-time, and in a
moment, as the husk breaks, the larva becomes the perfect
cicada.4 The creature, also, at once turns black5 in colour 10
and harder and larger, and takes to singing. In both
species, the larger and the smaller, it is the male that sings,
and the female that is unvocal.6 At first, the males are the
sweeter eating; but, after copulation, the females, as they
are full then of white eggs.
If you make a sudden noise as they are flying overhead
they let drop something like water. Country people, in 15
regard to this, say that they are voiding urine, i. e. that they
have an excrement, and that they feed upon dew.7
If you present your finger to a cicada and bend back the
tip of it and then extend it again, it will endure the presenta¬
tion more quietly than if you were to keep your finger
outstretched altogether: and it will set to climbing your
finger: 8 for the creature is so weak-sighted that it will take
1 The female cicada has a long and powerful ovipositor; cf. note antea, 28. 555b 21. 2 The cicada lays its eggs in dead twigs: the larva, issuing in the following year, becomes a ‘ nymph ’, which burrows deep in the ground, and after another year issues from its envelope as the perfect insect. 3 On cicadas as food cf.

20 to climbing your finger as though that were a moving
leaf.
Of insects that are not carnivorous but that live on the
juices of living flesh, such as lice and fleas and bugs, all,
without exception, generate what are called ‘ nits ’, and
these nits generate nothing.
25 Of these insects the flea is generated out of the slightest
amount of putrefying matter ; for wherever there is any
dry excrement, a flea is sure to be found. Bugs are
generated from the moisture of living animals, as it dries
up outside their bodies. Lice are generated out of the
flesh of animals.
When lice are coming there is a kind of small erup¬
tion visible, unaccompanied by any discharge of purulent
matter ; and, if you prick an animal when in this condition
557a at the spot of eruption, the lice jump out.1 In some men
the appearance of lice is a disease, in cases where the body
is surcharged with moisture; and, indeed, men have been
known to succumb to this louse-disease, as Aleman the
poet and the Syrian Pherecydes are said to have done.^
Moreover, in certain diseases lice appear in great
abundance.
There is also a species of louse called the ‘ wild louse ’,
5 and this is harder than the ordinary louse, and there is
exceptional difficulty in getting the skin rid of it. Boys'
heads are apt to be lousy, but men’s in less degree ; and
women are more subject to lice than men. But, whenever
people are troubled with lousy heads, they are less than
10 ordinarily troubled with headache. And lice are generated
in other animals than man. For birds are infested with
them ; and pheasants, unless they clean themselves in the
dust, are actually destroyed by them. All other winged
animals that are furnished with feathers are similarly in

fested, and all hair-coated creatures also, with the single
exception of the ass,1 which is infested neither with lice
nor with ticks.
Cattle suffer both from lice and from ticks. Sheep and 15
goats breed ticks, but do not breed lice. Pigs breed lice
large and hard. In dogs are found the flea peculiar to the
animal, the Cynoroestes '.1 3 In all animals that are subject
to lice, the latter originate from the animals themselves.
Moreover, in animals that bathe at all, lice are more than
usually abundant when they change the water in which 20
they bathe.
In the sea, lice are found on fishes, but they are
generated not out of the fish but out of slime; and they
resemble multipedal wood-lice, only that their tail is flat.
Sea-lice are uniform in shape and universal in locality, and 25
are particularly numerous on the body of the red mullet."
And all these insects are multipedal and devoid of blood.4
The parasite that feeds on the tunny is found in the
region of the fins ; it resembles a scorpion, and is about
the size of a spider.5 In the seas between Cyrene and
Egypt there is a fish that attends on the dolphin, which 3°
is called the ‘ dolphin’s louse ’.6 This fish gets exceedingly
fat from enjoying an abundance of food while the dolphin
is out in pursuit of its prey.
Other animalcules besides these are generated, as we 55713
have already remarked, some in wool or in articles made
of wool, as the ses or clothes-moth.7 And these animal¬
cules come in greater numbers if the woollen substances
are dusty; and they come in especially large numbers if
a spider 8 be shut up in the cloth or wool, for the creature

drinks up any moisture that may be there, and dries up
5 the woollen substance. This grub is found also in men’s
clothes.
A creature is also found in wax 1 long laid by, just as in
wood, and it is the smallest of animalcules and is white in
colour, and is designated the acari or mite. In books also
other animalcules are found, some resembling the grubs
io found in garments, and some resembling tailless scorpions,2
but very small. As a general rule we may state that such
animalcules are found in practically anything, both in dry
things that are becoming moist and in moist things that
are drying, provided they contain the conditions of life.
There is a grub entitled the ‘ faggot-bearer ’/ as strange
a creature as is known.4 Its head projects outside its shell,
15 mottled in colour, and its feet are near the end or apex, as
is the case with grubs in general ; but the rest of its body
is cased in a tunic as it were of spider’s web, and there are
little dry twigs about it, that look as though they had stuck
by accident to the creature as it went walking about. But
these twig-like formations are naturally connected with the
tunic, for just as the shell is with the body of the snail so is
the whole superstructure with our grub ; and they do not
drop off, but can only be torn off, as though they were all
20 of a piece with him, and the removal of the tunic is as fatal
to this grub as the removal of the shell would be to the
snail. In course of time this grub becomes a chrysalis,
as is the case with the silkworm, and lives in a motionless
condition. But as yet it is not known into what winged
25 condition it is transformed.
The fruit of the wild fig contains the psen, or fig-wasp.
This creature is a grub at first; but in due time the husk peels
off and the psen leaves the husk behind it and flies away,
and enters into the fruit of the fig-tree through its orifice/’ and

causes the fruit not to drop off; and with a view to this
phenomenon, country folk are in the habit of tying wild 30
figs on to fig-trees, and of planting wild fig-trees near
domesticated ones.1
33 In the case of animals that are quadrupeds and red
blooded and oviparous, generation takes place in the spring, 55&
but copulation does not take place in an uniform season.
In some cases it takes place in the spring, in others in
summer time, and in others in the autumn, according as the
subsequent season may be favourable for the young.
The tortoise lays eggs with a hard shell and of two
colours within, like birds’ eggs, and after laying them buries 5
them in the ground and treads the ground hard over them;
it then broods over the eggs on the surface of the ground,
and hatches the eggs the next year. The hemys, or fresh¬
water tortoise,2 leaves the water and lays its eggs. It digs
a hole of a cask-like shape, and deposits therein the eggs ;
after rather less than thirty days it digs the eggs up again
and hatches them with great rapidity, and leads its young »o
at once off to the water. The sea-turtle lays on the ground
eggs just like the eggs of domesticated birds, buries the
eggs in the ground, and broods over them in the night-time.
It lays a very great number of eggs, amounting at times to
one hundred.
Lizards and crocodiles, terrestrial and fluvial, lay eggs on 15
land. The eggs of lizards hatch spontaneously on land, for

Caprification, or artificial fertilization, consists in hanging ripe fruit of the Caprificus on fig-trees, whose figs are then in their female stage. Wasps (Cynifts Psenes, L., Blastophaga grossorum, Grav.) hatched within the former, enter the latter, carrying pollen with them. The literature on caprification is very large; cf. (in/. a/.)

the lizard does not live on into the next year; in fact, the
life of the animal is said not to exceed six months. The
river-crocodile1 lays a number of eggs, sixty at the most,
white in colour, and broods over them for sixty days: for,
20 by the way, the creature is very long-lived. And the dis¬
proportion is more marked in this animal than in any other
between the smallness of the original egg and the huge size of
the full-grown animal.2 For the egg is not larger than that of
the goose, and the young crocodile is small, answering to
the egg in size, but the full-grown animal attains the length
of twenty-six feet; in fact, it is actually stated that the
animal goes on growing to the end of its days.
25 With regard to serpents or snakes, the viper is externally 34
viviparous, having been previously oviparous internally
The egg, as with the egg of fishes, is uniform in colour and
soft-skinned. The young serpent grows on the surface of
the egg, and, like the young of fishes, has no shell-like
envelopment. The young of the viper is born inside a
membrane that bursts from off the young creature in three
30 days ; and at times the young viper eats its way out from
the inside of the egg. The mother viper brings forth all
its young in one day, twenty in number, and one at a time.
558b The other serpents are externally oviparous, and their eggs
are strung on to one another like a lady’s necklace; after
the dam has laid her eggs in the ground she broods over
them, and hatches the eggs in the following year.

 BOOK VI
I So much for the generative processes in snakes and 558b
insects, and also in oviparous quadrupeds.
Birds without exception lay eggs, but the pairing season ro
and the times of parturition are not alike for all.1 Some
birds couple and lay at almost any time in the year, as for
instance the barn-door hen and the pigeon : the former of
these coupling and laying during the entire year, with the
exception of the month before and the month after the
winter solstice.2 Some hens, even in the high breeds, lay 15
a large quantity of eggs before brooding, amounting to as
many as sixty ; and, by the way, the higher breeds are
less prolific than the inferior ones. The Adrian hens 3 are
small-sized, but they lay every day; they are cross-tempered,
and often kill their chickens ; they are of all colours. Some
domesticated hens lay twice a day;4 indeed, instances have 20
been known where hens, after exhibiting extreme fecundity,
have died suddenly. Hens, then, lay eggs, as has been
stated, at all times indiscriminately ; the pigeon, the ring¬
dove, the turtle-dove, and the stock-dove lay twice a year,5
and the pigeon actually lays ten times a year. The great
majority of birds lay during the spring-time. Some birds 25
are prolific, and prolific in either of two ways—either by
laying often, as the pigeon, or by laying many eggs at a
sitting, as the barn-door hen. All birds of prey, or birds
with crooked talons, are unprolific, except the kestrel: this

bird is the most prolific of birds of prey ;1 as many as four
eggs have been observed in the nest, and occasionally it
30 lays even more.
Birds in general lay their eggs in nests, but such
559a as are disqualified for flight, as the partridge and the
quail,2 do not lay them in nests but on the ground,
and cover them over with loose material. The same is
the case with the lark and the tetrix. These birds hatch
in sheltered places ; but the bird called merops in Boeotia,'1
alone of all birds, burrows into holes in the ground and
hatches there.
5 Thrushes, like swallows, build nests of clay, on high
trees, and build them in rows all close together, so that
from their continuity the structure resembles a necklace of
nests.4 Of all birds that hatch for themselves the hoopoe is
the only one that builds no nest whatever; it gets into the
hollow of the trunk of a tree, and lays its eggs there with¬
out making any sort of nest.’ The circus builds either
under a dwelling-roof or on cliffs. The tetrix, called ourax
in Athens, builds neither on the ground nor on trees, but on
low-lying shrubs.
15 The egg in the case of all birds alike is hard-shelled, if it 2
be the produce of copulation and be laid by a healthy hen
—for some hens lay soft eggs. The interior of the egg

Plin. x. 74) is not true of the thrush, nor is it known to be true as a whole of any other bird. That the thrush builds her nest of clay, or at least lines it therewith, is true, and this is all that we are told by Alex. Myndius: cf. Athen. ii. 65a. I am therefore inclined to think that the latter part of the sentence should refer to the swallow. On the swallow’s nest cf. H.A. ix. 7. 6i2b 21 ; Plin. x. 49; Ael. iii. 24, 25, &c; 5 A different account in H.A. ix. 15. 6i6a 3 5 ; Ael. iv. 26. The phrase kad' iavrov, as Seal, Schn., and others have shown, is difficult, nor is the sense made much clearer by substituting <a6' eavrd. The contrast implied may be with the cuckoo, which neither builds nor hatches, and this reference is the less unlikely from the resemblance in note and connexion in story between the two birds.

is of two colours, and the white part is outside and the
yellow part within.1
The eggs of birds that frequent rivers and marshes differ
from those of birds that live on dry land ; that is to say, 20
the eggs of water-birds have comparatively more of the
yellow or yolk and less of the white. Eggs vary in colour
according to their kind. Some eggs are white, as those of
the pigeon and of the partridge ; others are yellowish, as the
eggs of marsh birds ; in some cases the eggs are mottled, as
the eggs of the guinea-fowl and the pheasant;2 while the 25
eggs of the kestrel are red, like vermilion.
Eggs are not symmetrically shaped at both ends: in
other words, one end is comparatively sharp, and the other
end is comparatively blunt; and it is the latter end that
protrudes first at the time of laying. Long and pointed
eggs are female; those that are round, or more rounded at
the narrow end, are male.3 Eggs are hatched by the
incubation of the mother-bird. In some cases, as in Egypt, 559
they are hatched spontaneously in the ground, by being
buried in dung heaps.4 A story is told of a toper in
Syracuse, how he used to put eggs into the ground under
his rush-mat and to keep on drinking until he hatched
them.5 6 Instances have occurred of eggs being deposited in
warm vessels and getting hatched spontaneously. 5
The sperm of birds, as of animals in general, is white.
After the female has submitted to the male, she draws upr’
the sperm to underneath her midriff. At first it is little in
size and white in colour ; by and by it is red, the colour of
blood ; as it grows, it becomes pale and yellow all over. 10
When at length it is getting ripe for hatching, it is subject
to differentiation of substance, and the yolk gathers together

559b
within and the white settles round it on the outside. When
the full time is come, the egg detaches itself and protrudes,
changing from soft to hard with such temporal exactitude
that, whereas it is not hard during the process of pro
15 trusion, it hardens immediately after the process is com¬
pleted :1 that is if there be no concomitant pathological
circumstances. Cases have occurred where substances
resembling the egg at a critical point of its growth
that is, when it is yellow all over, as the yolk is subsequently
—have been found in the cock when cut open, underneath
his midriff, just where the hen has her eggs; and these
are entirely yellow in appearance and of the same size as
20 ordinary eggs. Such phenomena are regarded as unnatural
and portentous.
Such as affirm that wind-eggs are the residua of eggs
previously begotten from copulation are mistaken in this
assertion, for we have cases well authenticated where
chickens of the common hen and goose have laid wind
eggs without ever having been subjected to copulation.2 3
25 Wind-eggs are smaller, less palatable, and more liquid
than true eggs, and are produced in greater numbers.
When they are put under the mother bird, the liquid
contents never coagulate, but both the yellow and the
white remain as they were. Wind-eggs are laid by a
number of birds: as for instance by the common hen, the
hen partridge, the hen pigeon, the peahen, the goose,
and the vulpanseiv Eggs are hatched under brooding

hens more rapidly in summer than in winter ; that is to
say, hens hatch in eighteen days in summer, but occasionally 560
in winter take as many as twenty-five.1 And by the way
for brooding purposes some birds make better mothers
than others. If it thunders while a hen-bird is brooding,
the eggs get addled. Wind-eggs that are called by some
cynosura and uria are produced chiefly in summer. Wind- 5
eggs are called by some zephyr-eggs, because at spring¬
time hen-birds are observed to inhale the breezes ; they do
the same if they be stroked in a peculiar way by hand.
Wind-eggs can turn into fertile eggs, and eggs due to previous 10
copulation can change breed, if before the change of the
yellow to the white the hen that contains wind-eggs or eggs
begotten of copulation be trodden by another cock-bird.
Under these circumstances the wind-eggs turn into fertile
eggs, and the previously impregnated eggs follow the breed
of the impregnator; but if the latter impregnation takes
place during the change of the yellow to the white, then no 15
change in the egg takes place : the wind-egg does not
become a true egg, and the true egg does not take on the
breed of the latter impregnator.'2 If when the egg-substance
is small copulation be intermitted, the previously existing
egg-substance exhibits no increase; but if the hen be again

20 The yolk and the white are diverse not only in colour
but also in properties.1 Thus, the yolk congeals under the
influence of cold, whereas the white instead of congealing
is inclined rather to liquefy. Again, the white stiffens
under the influence of fire, whereas the yolk does not stiffen ;
25 but, unless it be burnt through and through, it remains soft,
and in point of fact is inclined to set or to harden more
from the boiling than from the roasting of the egg.2 The
yolk and the white are separated by a membrane from one
another. The so-called ‘ hail-stones or treadles, that are
found at the extremity 3 of the yellow in no way contribute
towards generation, as some erroneously suppose:4 they
30 are two in number, one below and the other above. If
you take out of the shells a number of yolks and a number
56ob of whites and pour them into a saucepan and boil them
slowly over a low fire, the yolks will gather into the centre
and the wrhites will set all round them.5
Young hens are the first to lay, and they do so at the
5 beginning of spring and lay more eggs than the older hens, but
the eggs of the younger hens are comparatively small.0 As a
general rule, if hens get no brooding they pine and sicken.7
After copulation hens shiver and shake themselves, and
often kick rubbish about all round them8—and this, by the
way, they do sometimes after laying—whereas pigeons trail

their rumps on the ground, and geese dive under the water.1 io
Conception of the true egg and conformation of the wind
egg take place rapidly with most birds ; as for instance with
the hen-partridge when in heat.2 The fact is that, when
she stands to windward and within scent of the male, she
conceives,3 and becomes useless for decoy purposes: for, by 15
the way, the partridge appears to have a very acute sense
of smell.
The generation of the egg after copulation and the genera¬
tion of the chick from the subsequent hatching of the egg
are not brought about within equal periods for all birds,
but differ as to time according to the size of the parent
birds. The egg of the common hen after copulation sets
and matures in ten days as a general rule; the egg of the 20
pigeon in a somewhat lesser period.4 Pigeons have the
faculty of holding back the egg at the very moment of
parturition ; if a hen pigeon be put about by any one, for
instance if it be disturbed on its nest, or have a feather
plucked out, or sustain any other annoyance or disturbance,
then even though she had made up her mind to lay she
can keep the egg back in abeyance.
A singular phenomenon is observed in pigeons with re- 25
gard to pairing: that is, they kiss one another just when the
male is on the point of mounting the female,5 and without
this preliminary the male would decline to perform his

function.1 With the older males the preliminary kiss is
only given to begin with, and subsequently he mounts
without previously kissing;2 3 with younger males the pre¬
liminary is never omitted. Another singularity in these
30 birds is that the hens tread one another when a cock is
not forthcoming, after kissing one another just as takes
place in the normal pairing. Though they do not impreg
56ia nate one another they lay more eggs under these than
under ordinary circumstances; no chicks, however, result
therefrom, but all such eggs are wind-eggs.
3 Generation from the egg proceeds in an identical manner 3
5 with all birds, but the full periods from conception to birth
differ, as has been said. With the common hen after three
days and three nights there is the first indication of the
embryo; with larger birds the interval being longer, with
smaller birds shorter. Meanwhile the yolk comes into being,
10 rising towards the sharp end,4 where the primal element of
the egg is situated, and where the egg gets hatched; and

The parts which I have bracketed as especially doubtful do not correspond precisely with those which Dittmeyer has bracketed. 4 The fuller account in G. A. in. 2. 752* is in part fanciful. The egg must not be spherical, but unsymmetrical in order that the part wherein lies the dpxr'i may be differentiated ; the dpxrj is at the point of attachment of the egg to the parent, as of the seed to its pod, and the broad end being found to issue first from the parent, and further, the fact that in deformed eggs an irregular outgrowth like an imperfect stalk is seen at the narrow end, determine the latter as the point of origin of the egg, the seat of the dpxrj. That being so, the head of the chicken, the nobler part, must ultimately be found here, and the egg is laid, so to speak, feet first, conversely to the birth of the vivipara. But this is a curious error, for it is easy to observe that in the ripened egg the chick’s head is at the broad end, and that there it breaks the shell; in the early stages the embryo floats uppermost, and confronts us at whatever point we open the egg.


 BOOK VI. 3 56ia *
the heart appears, like a speck of blood, in the white of the
egg.1 This point beats and moves as though endowed
with life, and from it two vein-ducts with blood in them
trend in a convoluted course [as the egg-substance goes on
growing, towards each of the two circumjacent integu¬
ments] ;2 and a membrane carrying bloody fibres now 15
envelops the yolk,3 leading off from the vein-ducts. A little
afterwards the body is differentiated, at first very small
and white. The head is clearly distinguished, and in it
the eyes, swollen out to a great extent. This condition
of the eyes lasts on for a good while, as it is only by 20
degrees that they diminish in size and collapse. At the
outset the under portion of the body appears insignificant
in comparison with the upper portion. Of the two ducts
that lead from the heart, the one proceeds towards the
circumjacent integument,4 and the other, like a navel-string,
towards the yolk. The life-element of the chick is in the
white of the egg, and the nutriment comes through the 25
navel-string out of the yolk.5
When the egg is now ten days old the chick and all its
parts are distinctly visible. The head is still larger than
the rest of its body, and the eyes larger than the head, but
still devoid of vision. The eyes, if removed about this
time, are found to be larger than beans, and black ; if the 30
cuticle be peeled off them there is a white and cold liquid
inside, quite glittering in the sunlight, but there is no hard
substance whatsoever. Such is the condition of the head

and eyes. At this time also the larger internal organs are
visible, as also the stomach and the arrangement of the
viscera; and the veins that seem to proceed from the heart
5 are now close to the navel. From the navel there stretch
a pair of veins ; one1 towards the membrane that envelops
the yoke (and, by the way, the yolk is now liquid, or more
so than is normal), and the other2 3 towards that membrane
which envelops collectively the membrane wherein the
chick lies, the membrane of the yolk, and the intervening
io liquid. [For, as the chick grows, little by little one part of
the yolk goes upward, and another part downward, and the
white liquid is between them; and the white of the egg is
underneath the lower part of the yolk, as it was at the
outset.] On the tenth day the white is at the extreme
outer surface, reduced in amount, glutinous, firm in sub
15 stance, and sallow in colour.
The disposition of the several constituent parts is as
follows. First and outermost comes the membrane of the
egg, not that of the shell, but:: underneath it. Inside this
membrane 4 is a white liquid ; then comes the chick, and
a membrane round about it,5 separating it off so as to keep
the chick free from the liquid ; next after the chick comes
20 the yolk, into which one of the two veins was described as
leading, the other one leading into the enveloping white
substance. [A membrane4 with a liquid resembling serum
envelops the entire structure. Then comes another mem¬
brane 5 right round the embryo, as has been described,
separating it off against the liquid. Underneath this comes
the yolk, enveloped in another membrane (into which yolk
25 proceeds the navel-string that leads from the heart and the
big vein), so as to keep the embryo free of both liquids.]
About the twentieth day, if you open the egg and touch
the chick, it moves inside and chirps; and it is already
coming to be covered with down, when, after the twentieth

day is past, the chick begins to break the shell.1 The head
is situated over the right leg close to the flank, and the 30
wing is placed over the head ; and about this time is plain
to be seen the membrane resembling an after-birth that
comes next after the outermost membrane of the shell,
into which membrane the one of the navel-strings was 562**
described as leading (and, by the way, the chick in its
entirety is now within it), and so also is the other mem¬
brane resembling an after-birth, namely that surrounding
the yolk, into which 2 the second navel-string was described
as leading; and both of them were described as being con¬
nected with the heart and the big vein. At this conjuncture 5
the navel-string that leads to the outer after-birth collapses
and becomes detached from the chick, and the membrane
that leads into the yolk is fastened on to the thin gut of the
creature, and by this time a considerable amount of the
yolk is inside the chick and a yellow sediment is in its
stomach. About this time it discharges residuum 3 in the 10
direction of the outer after-birth, and has residuum inside
its stomach ; and the outer residuum is white [and there
comes a white substance inside].4 By and by the yolk,
diminishing gradually in size, at length becomes entirely
used up and comprehended within the chick (so that, ten
days after hatching, if you cut open the chick, a small 15
remnant of the yolk is still left in connexion with the
gut),5 but it is detached from the navel, and there is
nothing in the interval between, but it has been used up
entirely. During the period above referred to the chick
sleeps, wakes up, makes a move and looks up and chirps ;
and the heart and the navel together palpitate as though 20
the creature were respiring. So much as to generation
from the egg in the case of birds.6

Birds lay some eggs that are unfruitful, even eggs that
are the result of copulation, and no life comes from such
eggs by incubation ; and this phenomenon is observed
especially with pigeons.
1 Twin eggs have two yolks. In some twin eggs a thin
25 partition of white intervenes to prevent the yolks mixing
with each other, but some twin eggs are unprovided with
such partition, and the yokes run into one another. There
are some hens that lay nothing but twin eggs,2 and in
their case the phenomenon regarding the yolks has been
observed. For instance, a hen has been known to lay
30 eighteen eggs, and to hatch twins out of them all, except
those that were wind-eggs ; the rest were fertile (though,
562b by the way, one of the twins is always bigger than the
other), but the eighteenth was abnormal or monstrous.3
Birds of the pigeon kind, such as the ring-dove and the 4
turtle-dove, lay two eggs at a time; that is to say, they
5 do so as a general rule, and they never lay more than three.
The pigeon, as has been said, lays at all seasons ; the
ring-dove and the turtle-dove lay in the spring-time, and
they never lay more than twice in the same season. The
hen-bird lays the second pair of eggs when the first pair
happens to have been destroyed, for many of the hen
pigeons destroy the first brood. The hen-pigeon, as has
been said, occasionally lays three eggs, but it never rears
jo more than two chicks, and sometimes rears only one; and
the odd one is always a wind-egg.4
Very few birds propagate within their first year. All
birds, after once they have begun laying, keep on having

eggs, though in the case of some birds it is difficult to
detect the fact from the minute size of the creature.
The pigeon, as a rule, lays a male and a female egg, and 15
generally lays the male egg first; after laying it allows
a day’s interval to ensue and then lays the second egg.
The male takes its turn of sitting during the daytime;
the female sits during the night. The first-laid egg is
hatched and brought to birth within twenty days ; and the
mother bird pecks a hole in the egg the day before she 20
hatches it out. The two parent birds brood for some time
over the chicks in the way in which they brooded previously
over the eggs. In all connected with the rearing of the
young the female parent is more cross-tempered than the
male, as is the case with most animals after parturition.
The hens lay as many as ten times in the year ;1 occasional
instances have been known of their laying eleven times, and 25
in Egypt they actually lay twelve times. The pigeon, male
and female, couples within the year ; in fact, it couples
when only six months old. Some assert that ring-doves
and turtle-doves pair and procreate when only three
months old, and instance their superabundant numbers by
way of proof of the assertion. The hen-pigeon carries her
eggs fourteen days; for as many more days the parent 30
birds hatch the eggs ; by the end of another fourteen days
the chicks are so far capable of flight as to be overtaken 563a
with difficulty. [The ring-dove, according to all accounts,
lives up to forty years.2 The partridge lives over sixteen.] 3
[After one brood the pigeon is ready for another within
thirty days.] 4
The vultureu builds its nest on inaccessible cliffs ;6 for 5
which reason its nest and young are rarely seen. And
therefore Herodorus, father of Bryson the Sophist, declares
that vultures belong to some foreign country unknown to
us, stating as a proof of the assertion that no one has ever

seen a vulture’s nest, and also that vultures in great numbers
io make a sudden appearance in the rear of armies. However,
difficult as it is to get a sight of it, a vulture’s nest has been
seen. The vulture lays two eggs.
[Carnivorous birds in general are observed to lay but
once a year. The swallow is the only carnivorous bird
that builds a nest twice.1 If you prick out the eyes 2 of
swallow chicks while they are yet young, the birds will get
15 well again and will see by and by.] 3
The eagle4 lays three eggs and hatches two of them, as 6
it is said in the verses ascribed to Musacus:
That lays three, hatches two, and cares for one.
This is the case in most instances, though occasionally
20 a brood of three has been observed. As the young ones
grow, the mother becomes wearied with feeding them and
extrudes one of the pair from the nest. At the same time
the bird is said to abstain from food,5 to avoid harrying the
young of wild animals. That is to say, its wings blanch, and
25 for some days its talons get turned awry. It is in conse¬
quence about this time cross-tempered to its own young.
The phene is said to rear the young one that has been
expelled the nest. The eagle broods for about thirty days.6

 BOOK VI. 6 563a
The hatching period is about the same for the larger
birds, such as the goose and the great bustard ; for the
middle-sized birds it extends over about twenty days, as in
the case of the kite and the hawk.1 The kite in general 30
lays two eggs, but occasionally rears three young ones.
The so-called aegolius at times rears four. It is not true
that, as some aver, the raven lays only two eggs ;2 it lays a 5b3b
larger number. It broods for about twenty days and then
extrudes its young.3 Other birds perform the same opera¬
tion ; at all events mother birds that lay several eggs often
extrude one of their young.
Birds of the eagle species are not alike in the treatment 5
of their young. The white-tailed eagle is cross, the black
eagle is affectionate in the feeding of the young; though,
by the way, all birds of prey, when their brood is rather
forward in being able to fly, beat and extrude them from
the nest.4 The majority of birds other than birds of prey,
as has been said, also act in this manner, and after feeding 10
their young take no further care of them; but the crow is
an exception. This bird for a considerable time takes
charge of her young ; for, even when her young can fly, she
flies alongside of them and supplies them with food.5
7 The cuckoo is said by some to be a hawk transformed,6
because at the time of the cuckoo’s coming, the hawk, 15
which it resembles,7 is never seen ; and indeed it is only

for a few days that you will see hawks about when the
cuckoo’s note sounds early in the season. The cuckoo
appears only for a short time in summer, and in winter
disappears. The hawk has crooked talons, which the cuckoo
20 has not ; neither with regard to the head does the cuckoo
resemble the hawk. In point of fact, both as regards the
head and the claws it more resembles the pigeon.1 How¬
ever, in colour and in colour alone it does resemble the
hawk, only that the markings of the hawk are striped, and
of the cuckoo mottled. And, by the way, in size and flight
25 it resembles the smallest of the hawk tribe,2 3 which bird dis¬
appears as a rule about the time of the appearance of the
cuckoo, though the two have been seen simultaneously.
The cuckoo has been seen to be preyed on by the hawk ;
and this never happens between birds of the same species.13
They say no one has ever seen the young of the cuckoo.
30 The bird lays eggs, but does not build a nest.4 Sometimes
it lays its eggs in the nest of a smaller bird after first
devouring the eggs of this bird ; it lays by preference in the
564a nest of the ring-dove, after first devouring the eggs of the
pigeon. (It occasionally lays two, but usually one.) It lays
also in the nest of the hypolais,5 and the hypolais hatches
and rears the brood. It is about this time that the bird
becomes fat and palatable. [The young of hawks also get
5 palatable and fat. One species builds a nest in the wilder¬
ness and on sheer and inaccessible cliffs.]6
With most birds, as has been said of the pigeon, the 8
hatching is carried on by the male and the female in turns:
with some birds, however, the male only sits long enough to

allow the female to provide herself with food. In the goose
tribe the female alone incubates, and after once sitting on io
the eggs she continues brooding until they are hatched.1
The nests of all marsh-birds are built in districts fenny
and well supplied with grass ; consequently, the mother
bird while sitting quiet on her eggs can provide herself
with food without having to submit to absolute fasting.
With the crow also the female alone broods, and broods 15
throughout the whole period ; the male bird supports the
female, bringing her food and feeding her. The female of
the ring-dove begins to brood in the afternoon and broods
through the entire night until breakfast-time of the follow¬
ing day; the male broods during the rest of the time.2 20
Partridges build a nest in two compartments; the male
broods on the one and the female on the other.3 After
hatching, each of the parent birds rears its brood. But the
male, when he first takes his young out of the nest, treads
them.4
Peafowl5 live for about twenty-five years, breed about ^5
the third year, and at the same time take on their spangled
plumage. They hatch their eggs within thirty days or rather
more. The peahen lays but once a year, and lays twelve
eggs, or may be a slightly lesser number: she does not lay
all the eggs there and then one after the other, but at
intervals of two or three days. Such as lay for the first 3°
time lay about eight eggs. The peahen lays wind-eggs.
They pair in the spring; and laying begins immediately
after pairing. The bird moults when the earliest trees are 564b
shedding their leaves, and recovers its plumage when the
same trees are recovering their foliage.0 People that rear

peafowl put the eggs under the barn-door hen,1 owing to
the fact that when the peahen is brooding over them the
5 peacock attacks her and tries to trample on them ; owing
to this circumstance some birds of wild varieties run away
from the males and lay their eggs and brood in solitude.
Only two eggs are put under a barn-door hen, for she could
not brood over and hatch a large number. They take
every precaution, by supplying her with food, to prevent
her going off the eggs and discontinuing the brooding,
io With male birds about pairing time the testicles are
obviously larger than at other times, and this is conspicuously
the case with the more salacious birds, such as the barn¬
door cock and the cock partridge ; the peculiarity is less
conspicuous in such birds as are intermittent in regard to
pairing.2
So much for the conception and generation of birds.
15 It has been previously stated that fishes are not all
oviparous.3 Fishes of the cartilaginous genus are viviparous ;
the rest are oviparous. And cartilaginous fishes are first
oviparous internally and subsequently viviparous; 4 they
rear the embryos internally, the batrachus or fishing-frog
being an exception.5
Fishes also, as was above stated, are provided with
wombs, and wombs of diverse kinds. The oviparous

On the contrary, Aelian’s account is apparently a poor description of the skate’s egg; and again, in G.A. iii. 3. 754a 33, it is probably the skate’s egg that is referred to. The account in H. A. vi. 17. 57ob 33 is again not true of the fishing-frog. In the whole matter it is im¬ possible to disentangle zoological error from confusion of nomen¬ clature, or from possible textual corruption of fSdros for ^drpa\os.

genera have wombs bifurcate in shape and low down in 20
position; the cartilaginous genus have wombs shaped like
those of birds.1 The womb, however, in the cartilaginous
fishes differs in this respect from the womb of birds, that
with some cartilaginous fishes the eggs do not settle close
to the diaphragm but middle-ways2 along the backbone,
and as they grow they shift their position.
The egg with all fishes is not of two colours within but
is of even hue ; and the colour is nearer to white than to 25
.yellow, and that both when the young is inside it and
previously as well.
Development from the egg in fishes differs from that in
birds in this respect, that it does not exhibit that one of the
two navel-strings that:: leads off to the membrane that lies
close under the shell, while it does exhibit that one of the
two that in the case of birds leads off to the yolk.4 In a
general way the rest of the development from the egg 30
onwards is identical in birds and fishes. That is to say,
development takes place at the upper part of the egg, and
the veins extend in like manner, at first from the heart ;
and at first the head, the eyes, and the upper parts are
largest; and as the creature grows the egg-substance 565a
decreases and eventually disappears, and becomes absorbed
within the embryo, just as takes place with the yolk in
birds. __
The navel-string is attached a little way below the aperture
of the belly.5 When the creatures are young the navel
string is long, but as they grow it diminishes in size; at length 5
it gets small and becomes incorporated, as was described in
the case of birds. The embryo and the egg are enveloped
by a common membrane, and just under this is another
membrane that envelops the embryo by itself; and in be¬
tween the two membranes is a liquid. The food inside 10

the stomach of the little fishes resembles that inside the
stomach of young chicks, and is partly white and partly
yellow.
As regards the shape of the womb, the reader is referred
to my treatise on Anatomy. The womb, however, is
diverse in diverse fishes, as for instance in the sharks as
compared one with another or as compared with the skate.
That is to say, in some sharks the eggs adhere in the
5 middle of the womb 1 round about the backbone, as has
been stated, and this is the case with the dog-fish ;2 as the
eggs grow they shift their place'; and since the womb is
bifurcate and adheres to the midriff, as in the rest of similar
creatures, the eggs pass into one or other of the two com¬
partments. This womb and the womb of the other sharks
o exhibit, as you go a little way off from the midriff, some¬
thing resembling white breasts,3 which never make their
appearance unless there be conception.
Dog-fish and skate have a kind of egg-shell, in the which
is found an egg-like liquid. The shape of the egg-shell
resembles the tongue of a bagpipe,4 and hair-like ducts are
5 attached to the shell. With the dog-fish which is called
by some the ‘dappled shark’,5 the young are born when
the shell-formation breaks in pieces and falls out; with the
ray, after it has laid the egg the shell-formation breaks up
and the young move out.6 The spiny dog-fish has its eggs

The resemblance of such an egg-case as that of Scyllium (especially after it has split at one end for the escape of the young) to a ‘ split ’ reed such as that of the bag¬ pipes is close and accurate. Theoph. H.P. iv. n describes clearly how the cane is split and two pieces applied together to form the ‘ reed’. A. and W. miss the point when they say that the comparison is with the stalk of the reed, and ‘ nicht sowohl auf die Figur als auf die Masse und deren aussercs Aussehen zu beziehen’. 5 vefiplat.

In the viviparous Mustelus (yriAeos 6 Aftos) there is, however, a thin and temporary egg-shell which breaks up at an early stage ; and it may be that vefipias refers to some species intermediate in character of which we lack recent information.

close to the midriff above the breast-like formations ; when 30
the egg descends, as soon as it gets detached the young is
born. The mode of generation is the same in the case of 5b5b
the fox-shark.
The so-called smooth shark has its eggs in betwixt the
wombs like the dog-fish ; these eggs shift into each of
the two horns of the womb and descend, and the young
develop with the navel-string attached to the womb, so that, 5
as the egg-substance gets used up, the embryo is sustained
to all appearance just as in the case of quadrupeds.1 The
navel-string is long and adheres to the under part of the
womb (each navel-string being attached as it were by
a sucker), and also to the centre of the embryo in the place
where the liver is situated. If the embryo be cut open,
even though it has the egg-substance no longer, the food
inside is egg-like in appearance. Each embryo, as in the 10
case of quadrupeds, is provided with a chorion and separate
membranes. When young the embryo has its head up¬
wards, but downwards when it gets strong and is completed
in form. Males are generated on the left-hand side of the
womb, and females on the right-hand side, and males and
females on the same side together.2 If the embryo be cut 15
open, then, as with quadrupeds, such internal organs as it
is furnished with, as for instance the liver, are found to be
large and supplied with blood.
All cartilaginous fishes have at one and the same time
eggs above close to the midriff (some larger, some smaller),
in considerable numbers.3 and also embryos lower down. 20
And this circumstance leads many to suppose that fishes of
this species pair and bear young every month, inasmuch as
they do not produce all their young at once, but now and
again and over a lengthened period. But such eggs as have
come down below within the womb are simultaneously
ripened and completed in growth.

Dog-fish in general can extrude and take in again their
25 young,1 as can also the angel-fish and the electric ray—and,
by the way, a large electric ray has been seen with about
eighty embryos inside it—but the spiny dog-fish 2 is an
exception to the rule, being prevented by the spine of the
young fish from so doing. Of the flat cartilaginous fish,
the trygon and the ray cannot extrude and take in again
in consequence of the roughness of the tails of the young.
The batrachus 3 or fishing-frog also is unable to take in its
30 young owing to the size of the head and the prickles ; and,
by the way, as was previously remarked, it is the only one
of these fishes that is not viviparous.
566a So much for the varieties of the cartilaginous species and
for their modes of generation from the egg.
At the breeding season the sperm-ducts of the male are 11
filled with sperm, so much so that if they be squeezed the
sperm flows out spontaneously as a white fluid ; the ducts
5 are bifurcate, and start from the midriff and the great vein.
About this period the sperm-ducts of the male are quite
distinct [from the womb of the female],4 but at any other
than the actual breeding time5 their distinctness is not
obvious to a non-expert. The fact is that in certain fishes
at certain times these organs are imperceptible, as was
stated regarding the testicles of birds.0
10 Among other distinctions observed between the thoric
ducts and the womb-ducts is the circumstance that the
thoric ducts are attached to the loins, while the womb
ducts move about freely and are attached by a thin mem¬
brane. The particulars regarding the thoric ducts may

be studied by a reference to the diagrams in my treatise
on Anatomy.
Cartilaginous fishes are capable of superfoetation, and 15
their period of gestation is six months at the longest. The
so-called starry dog-fish bears young the most frequently ;
in other words it bears twice a month.1 The breeding
season is in the month of Maemacterion.2 The dog-fish as
a general rule bear twice in the year, with the exception of 20
the little dog-fish,3 which bears only once a year. Some of
them bring forth in the springtime. The rhine, or angel¬
fish, bears its first brood in the springtime, and its second
in the autumn, about the winter setting of the Pleiads;4
the second brood is the stronger of the two. The electric
ray brings forth in the late autumn.5 6
Cartilaginous fishes come out from the main seas and
deep waters towards the shore and there bring forth their
young, and they do so for the sake of warmth and by way 25
of protection for their young.
Observations would lead to the general rule that no one
variety of fish pairs with another variety. The angel-fish,
however, and the batus or skate appear to pair with one
another; for there is a fish called the rhinobatus, with the
head and front parts of the skate and the after parts of the
rhine or angel-fish, just as though it were made up of both 30
fishes together.0
Sharks then and their congeners, as the fox-shark 7 and
the dog-fish, and the flat fishes, such as the electric ray, the
ray, the smooth skate, and the trygon, are first oviparous 566b

and then viviparous in the way above mentioned, [as are
also the saw-fish and the ox-ray].1
The dolphin, the whale, and all the rest of the Cetacea,
all, that is to say, that are provided with a blow-hole
instead of gills, are viviparous.2 That is to say, no one of
all these fishes is ever seen to be supplied with eggs, but
5 directly with an embryo from whose differentiation comes
the fish, just as in the case of mankind and the viviparous
quadrupeds.
The dolphin bears one at a time generally, but occasion¬
ally two.3 The whale bears one or at the most two, generally
two. The porpoise in this respect resembles the dolphin,
and, by the way, it is in form like a little dolphin, and is
io found in the Euxine;4 it differs, however, from the dolphin
as being less in size and broader in the back ; its colour is
leaden-black. Many people are of opinion that the porpoise
is a variety of the dolphin.
All creatures that have a blow-hole respire and inspire,
for they are provided with lungs.5 The dolphin has been
15 seen asleep with his nose above water, and when asleep he
snores.6
The dolphin and the porpoise are provided with milk,
and suckle their young.7 They also take their young,
when small, inside them. The young of the dolphin
grows rapidly, being full-grown at ten8 years of age.
20 Its period of gestation is ten months. It brings forth its
young in summer, and never at any other season ; [and,
singularly enough, under the Dog-star it disappears for
about thirty days].9 Its young accompany it for a con

for the strength of its parental affection.1 It lives for many
years; some are known to have lived for more than

The seal is an amphibious animal: that is to say, it
cannot take in water, but breathes and sleeps and brings
forth on dry land 2—only close to the shore—as being an
animal furnished with feet; it spends, however, the greater
part of its time in the sea and derives its food from it, so 30
that it must be classed in the category of marine animals.
It is viviparous by immediate conception and brings forth
its young alive, and exhibits an after-birth and all else
just like a ewe. It bears one or two at a time, and three at 567s
the most. It has two teats, and suckles its young like
a quadruped. Like the human species it brings forth at
all seasons of the year, but especially at the time when the
earliest kids are forthcoming. It conducts its young ones,
when they are about twelve days old, over and over again 5
during the day down to the sea, accustoming them by slow
degrees to the water.3 It slips down steep places instead
of walking, from the fact that it cannot steady itself by its
feet. It can contract and draw itself in, for it is fleshy and
soft and its bones are gristly.4 Owing to the flabbiness of
its body it is difficult to kill a seal by a blow, unless you 10
strike it on the temple. It looks like a cow. The female
in regard to its genital organs resembles the female of the

Oviparous fishes have their womb bifurcate and placed 13
low down, as was said previously 1—and, by the way, all
scaly fish are oviparous, as the basse, the mullet, the grey
20 mullet, and the etelis,2 and all the so-called white-fish,
and all the smooth or slippery fish except the eel3—and
their roe is of a crumbling or granular substance. This
appearance4 is due to the fact that the whole womb of
such fishes is full of eggs, so that in little fishes there
seem to be only a couple of eggs there;5 for in small fishes
the womb is indistinguishable, from its diminutive size and
thin contexture. The pairing of fishes has been discussed
25 previously.6
Fishes for the most part are divided into males and
females, but one is puzzled to account for the erythrinus
and the channa,7 for specimens of these species are never
caught except in a condition of pregnancy.
With such fish as pair, eggs are the result of copulation,
but such fish have them also without copulation ;8 9 and this
30 is shown in the case of some river-fish, for the minnow 0
has eggs when quite small,—almost, one may say, as soon
as it is born. These fishes shed 10 their eggs little by little,
and, as is stated, the males swallow the greater part of
them,11 and some portion of them goes to waste in the
5b7b water ; but such of the eggs as the female deposits on the
spawning beds are saved.12 If all the eggs were preserved,

each species would be infinite in number. The greater
number of these eggs so deposited are not productive, but
only those over which the male sheds the milt or sperm ;
for when the female has laid her eggs, the male follows
and sheds its sperm over them, and from all the eggs so 5
besprinkled young fishes proceed, while the rest are left
to their fate.1
2 The same phenomenon is observed in the case of molluscs
also ; for in the case of the cuttlefish or sepia, after the
female has deposited her eggs, the male besprinkles them.3
It is highly probable that a similar phenomenon takes
place in regard to molluscs in general, though up to the 10
present time the phenomenon has been observed only in the
case of the cuttlefish.
Fishes deposit their eggs close in to shore, the goby
close to stones ; and, by the way, the spawn of the goby is
flat and crumbly. Fish in general so deposit their eggs ;
for the water close in to shore is warm and is better supplied
with food than the outer sea, and serves as a protection to
the spawn against the voracity of the larger fish. And it is 15
for this reason that in the Euxine most fishes spawn near
the mouth of the river Thermodon, because the locality is
sheltered, genial, and supplied with fresh water.
Oviparous fish as a rule spawn only once a year. The
little phycis or black goby is an exception, as it spawns
twice; the male of the black goby4 differs from the female 20
as being blacker and having larger scales.
Fishes then in general produce their young by copulation,

1 The meaning is doubtful, and the phrase probably does not mean much. We should be reluctant to read in it the assertion that un¬ fertilized eggs sometimes do and sometimes do not develop, especially in view of the foregoing sentence, of 568^ 8, and of parallel passages in the G.A.', while on the other hand the Greek is somewhat strained by the rendering above given, which, however, I take to express the idea that was present to the author’s mind. 2 A. and W. bracket 567^ 8-22, Dittm. 12-22. 3 G.A. iii. 8. 758“ 15. 4 (pvKrjs, Gobius niger (Apostolides).

escape out.1 For the fish has a diaphysis or cloven growth
25 under the belly and abdomen (like the blind snakes),2 and,
after it has spawned by the splitting of this diaphysis, the
sides of the split3 grow together again.
Development from the egg takes place similarly with
fishes that are oviparous internally and with fishes that are
oviparous externally ; that is to say, the embryo comes at
the upper end of the egg and is enveloped in a membrane,
30 and the eyes, large and spherical, are the first organs visible.
From this circumstance it is plain that the assertion is un¬
tenable which is made by some writers, to wit, that the
young of oviparous fishes are generated like the grubs of
worms; for the opposite phenomena are observed in the
case of these grubs, in that their lower extremities are the
larger at the outset, and that the eyes and the head appear
later on.4
568a After the egg has been used up, the young fishes are like
tadpoles5 in shape, and at first, without taking any nutri¬
ment, they grow by sustenance derived from the juice
oozing from the egg; by and by, they are nourished up to
full growth by the river-waters.
When the Euxine is ‘ purged ’c a substance called phycus
5 is carried into the Hellespont, and this substance is of a
pale yellow colour. Some writers aver that it is the flower
of the phycus, from which rouge is made ;7 it comes at the

beginning of summer. Oysters and the small fish of these
localities feed on this substance, and some of the inhabitants
of these maritime districts say that the purple murex derives
its peculiar colour from it.1 10
14 Marsh-fishes and river-fishes conceive at the age of five
months as a general rule, and deposit their spawn towards
the close of the year without exception.2 And with these
fishes, like as with the marine fishes, the female does not
void all her eggs at one time, nor the male his sperm ; but 15
they are at all times more or less provided, the female with
eggs, and the male with sperm. The carp spawns as the
seasons come round, five or six times, and follows in spawn¬
ing the rising of the greater constellations/1 The chalcis
spawns three times, and the other fishes once only in the
year. They all spawn in pools left by the overflowing of 2c
rivers, and near to reedy places in marshes; as for instance
the phoxinus or minnow and the perch.
The glanis or sheat-fish 4 and the perch deposit their
spawn in one continuous string, like the frog; so con¬
tinuous, in fact, is the convoluted spawn of the perch that,5
by reason of its smoothness, the fishermen in the marshes
can unwind it off the reeds like threads off a reel. The 25
larger individuals of the sheat-fish spawn in deep waters,
some in water of a fathom’s depth, the smaller in shallower
water, generally close to the roots of the willow or of
some other tree, or close to reeds or to moss. At times
1 A. and W. bracket this paragraph ; it may be out of place, but it is of no small interest and value. Phycus is mentioned as a sea-weed yielding a rouge or purple dye, Theoph. H.P. iv. 7 ; Plin. xiii. 25, &c. 2 Cf. viii. 15. 3 e. g. the Pleiads, Arcturus, and the Dog-star, Plin. xi. 14. 4 The common European Silurus glanis deposits its eggs in a hole, and leaves them after fertilization without further care. But there is another species in Greece, Parasilurus Aristotelis (Agassiz), and Agassiz and Gill argue that we learn from Aristotle the habits of this fish, habits which agree with those of its allies, the N. American catfishes. This fish is still called yXdvos, yXdvidi, &c., and is common in the Achelous, the Peneus, and elsewhere. Cf. L. Agassiz, Proc. Am. Acad, of Arts and Sc. iii. pp. 325-34, 185 ; Th. Gill, Washing¬ ton Univ. Bull. v. pp. 5-13, 1907. 5 The roe of the perch consists of a concatenation of little eggs, like poppy-seeds, enveloped in a gelatinous meshwork; it has a considerable resemblance to frog-spawn.

30 these fishes intertwine with one another, a big with a little
one, and bring into juxtaposition the ducts—which some
writers designate as navels—at the point where they emit
56813 the generative products and discharge the egg in the case
of the female and the milt in the case of the male.
Such eggs as are besprinkled with the milt grow, in a
day or thereabouts, whiter and larger, and in a little while
afterwards the fish’s eyes become visible, for these organs in
b all fishes, as for that matter in all other animals, are early
conspicuous and seem disproportionately big. But such
eggs as the milt fails to touch remain, as with marine
fishes, useless and infertile. From the fertile eggs, as the
little fish grow, a kind of sheath detaches itself; this is a
10 membrane that envelops the egg and the young fish. When
the milt has mingled with the eggs, the resulting product
becomes very sticky or viscous, and adheres to the roots
of trees or wherever it may have been laid. The male
keeps on guard at the principal spawning-place, and the
female after spawning goes away.
15 In the case of the sheat-fish the growth from the egg is
exceptionally slow, and, in consequence, the male has to keep
watch for forty or fifty days to prevent the spawn being
devoured by such little fishes as chance to come by.1 Next
in point of slowness is the generation of the carp. As with
fishes in general, so even with these, the spawn thus protected
disappears and gets lost rapidly.2
In the case of some of the smaller fishes 3 when they are
only three days old young fishes are generated. Eggs
20 touched by the male sperm take on increase both the same
day and also later. The egg of the sheat-fish is as big as a
vetch-seed ; the egg of the carp and of the carp-species as
big as a millet-seed.
These fishes then spawn and generate in the way here
described. The chalcis,4 * however, spawns in deep water

in dense shoals of fish;1 and the so-called tilon 2 spawns 25
near to beaches in sheltered spots in shoals likewise.
The carp, the baleros, and fishes in general push eagerly
into the shallows for the purpose of spawning, and very
often thirteen or fourteen males are seen following a single
female. When the female deposits her spawn and departs, 30
the males follow on and shed the milt. The greater portion
of the spawn gets wasted ; because, owing to the fact that
the female moves about while spawning, the spawn scatters, 569**
or so much of it as is caught in the stream and does not
get entangled with some rubbish. For, with the exception
of the sheat-fish, no fish keeps on guard ; unless, by the way,
it be the carp, which is said to remain on guard,3 if it so
happen that its spawn lies in a solid mass.
All male fishes are supplied with milt, excepting the 5
eel :4 with the eel, the male is devoid of milt, and the
female of spawn. The mullet goes up from the sea to
marshes and rivers; the eels, on the contrary, make their
way down from the marshes and rivers to the sea.
*5 5 The great majority of fish, then, as has been stated, 10
proceed from eggs. However, there are some fish that
proceed from mud and sand, even of those kinds that
proceed also from pairing and the egg. This occurs
in ponds here and there, and especially in a pond
in the neighbourhood of Cnidos. This pond, it is said,
at one time ran dry about the rising of the Dog-star,
and the mud had all dried up;6 at the first fall of the 15
rains7 there was a show of water in the pond, and
on the first appearance of the water shoals of tiny fish
were found in the pond. The fish in question was
water fish, is elsewhere referred to as marine. Cf, iv. 9. 535^ 18, viii. 20. 6o2b 28, ix. 37. 62ib 7. 1 Read adpoa Kai dyeXaln.

a kind of mullet, one which does not proceed from normal
pairing, about the size of a small sprat, and not one of these
fishes was provided with either spawn or milt. There
are found also in Asia Minor, in rivers not communicating
20 with the sea, little fishes like whitebait,1 differing from the
small fry found near Cnidos but found under similar cir¬
cumstances. Some writers actually aver that mullet all
grow spontaneously.2 In this assertion they are mistaken,
for the female of the fish is found provided with spawn,
and the male with milt. However, there is a species of
mullet that grows spontaneously out of mud and sand.
25 From the facts above enumerated it is quite proved that
certain fishes come spontaneously into existence, not being
derived from eggs or from copulation. Such fish as are
neither oviparous nor viviparous arise all from one of two
sources, from mud, or from sand and from decayed matter
that rises thence as a scum ; for instance, the so-called
froth of the small fry3 comes out of sandy ground. This
30 fry is incapable of growth and of propagating its kind ;
56915 after living for a while it dies away and another creature
takes its place, and so, with short intervals excepted, it
may be said to last the whole year through. At all events,
it lasts from the autumn rising of Arcturus4 up to the
spring-time. As a proof that these fish occasionally come
5 out of the ground we have the fact that in cold weather
they are not caught, and that they are caught in warm
weather, obviously coming up out of the ground to catch
the heat; also, when the fishermen use dredges and the
ground is scraped up fairly often, the fishes appear in
larger numbers and of superior quality. All other small
fry are inferior in quality owing to rapidity of growth. $

Young fry, especially those of the atherine or sand-smelt, are still called notinati in the Adriatic, nonnats at Marseilles (Faber). The young atherines cling together in dense masses and in incredible numbers ; they are sold chiefly to the poor, fried, baked in milk, or preserved in oil. Cams ascribes the name nonnati to Gobius fiellucidus, Nardo. 4 Middle of September.


 BOOK VI. 15 569
The fry are found in sheltered and marshy 1 districts, 10
when after a spell of fine weather the ground is getting
warmer, as, for instance, in the neighbourhood of Athens,
at Salamis and near the tomb of Themistocles and at
Marathon; for in these districts the froth is found.2 It
appears, then, in such districts and during such weather,
and occasionally appears after a heavy fall of rain in the 15
froth that is thrown up by the falling rain, from which
circumstance the substance derives its specific name.3
Foam is occasionally brought in on the surface of the sea
in fair weather. [And4 in this, where it has formed on the
surface, the so-called froth collects, as grubs swarm in
manure; for which reason this fry is often brought in from 20
the open sea. The fish is at its best in quality and quantity
in moist warm weather.]
The ordinary fry is the normal issue of parent fishes :
the so-called gudgeon-fry of small insignificant gudgeon-like
fish that burrow under the ground. From the Phaleric fry
comes the membras,5 from the membras the trichis, from 25
the trichis the trichias, and from one particular sort of fry,
to wit from that found in the harbour of Athens, comes
what is called the encrasicholus, or anchovy.6 There is
another fry, derived from the maenis 7 and the mullet.
The unfertile fry is watery and keeps only a short time,
as has been stated, for at last only head and eyes are left. 3°

transporting it to a distance, as when salted it keeps for
a considerable time.
Eels are not the issue of pairing, neither are they ovi- 16
parous; nor was an eel ever found supplied with either
milt or spawn, nor are they when cut open found to have
5 within them passages for spawn or for eggs. In point
of fact, this entire 1 species of blooded animals proceeds
neither from pairing nor from the egg.
There can be no doubt that the case is so. For in some
standing pools, after the water has been drained off and
the mud has been dredged away, the eels appear again
io after a fall of rain. In time of drought they do not appear
even in stagnant ponds, for the simple reason that their
existence and sustenance is derived from rain-water.
There is no doubt, then, that they proceed neither from
pairing nor from an egg. Some writers, however, are of
opinion that they generate their kind, because in some eels
little worms are found, from which they suppose that eels
15 are derived.2 But this opinion is not founded on fact. Eels
are derived from the so-called ‘ earth’s guts ’ that grow
spontaneously in mud and in humid ground ;3 * * * * 8 in fact, ee
have at times been seen to emerge out of such earthworms,
and on other occasions have been rendered visible when the
earthworms were laid open by either scraping or cutting.
Such earthworms are found both in the sea and in rivers,
20 especially where there is decayed matter: in the sea in
places where sea-weed abounds, and in rivers and marshes
near to the edge; for it is near to the water’s edge that
sun-heat has its chief power and produces putrefaction.
So much for the generation of the eel.
25 Fish do not all bring forth their young at the same 17
season nor all in like manner, neither is the period of
gestation for all of the same duration.
Before pairing the males and females gather together in
shoals ; at the time for copulation and parturition they

 BOOK VI. 17 570
pair off. With some fishes the time of gestation 1 2 is not
longer than thirty days, with others it is a lesser period ;
but with all it extends over a number of days divisible by 30
seven. The longest period of gestation is that of the
species which some call a marinns?
The sargue conceives during the month of Poseideon (or
December),3 and carries its spawn for thirty days ; and the 570
species of mullet named by some the chelon, and the
myxon,4 go with spawn at the same period and over the
same length of time.
All fish suffer greatly during the period of gestation, and
are in consequence very apt to be thrown up on shore at
this time. In some cases they are driven frantic with pain 5
and throw themselves on land. At all events they are
throughout this time continually in motion until parturition
is over (this being especially true of the mullet), and after
parturition they are in repose. With many fish the time
for parturition terminates on the appearance of grubs
within the belly;5 for small living grubs get generated
there and eat up 6 the spawn. 10
With shoal fishes parturition takes place in the spring,
and indeed, with most fishes, about the time of the spring
equinox ;7 with others it is at different times, in summer
with some, and with others about the autumn equinox.
The first of shoal fishes to spawn is the atherine,8 and it
spawns close to land ; the last is the cephalus: and this is !5
inferred from the fact that the brood of the atherine
appears first of all and the brood of the cephalus last. The

mullet also spawns early.1 The saupe spawns usually at
the beginning of summer, but occasionally in the autumn.
The aulopias, which some call the anthias,2 3 spawns in the
20 summer. Next in order of spawning comes the chryso
phrys:i or gilthead, the basse,4 the mormyrus,5 and in
general such fish as are nicknamed ‘ runners ’.6 Latest in
order of the shoal fish come the red mullet7 and the
coracine ; these spawn in autumn. The red mullet spawns
on mud, and consequently, as the mud continues cold for
a long while, spawns late in the year. The coracine carries
its spawn for a long time ; but, as it lives usually on rocky
ground, it goes to a distance and spawns in places abounding
25 in sea-weed, at a period later than the red mullet. The
maenis spawns about the winter solstice. Of the others,
such as are pelagic spawn for the most part in summer;
which fact is proved by their not being caught by fishermen
during this period.
Of ordinary fishes the most prolific is the sprat; of car
30 tilaginous fishes, the fishing-frog. Specimens, however, of
the fishing-frog are rare from the facility with which the
young are destroyed, as the female lays her spawn all in
a lump close in to shore.8 As a rule, cartilaginous fish are
less prolific than other fish owing to their being viviparous;
57icl and their young by reason of their size have a better
chance of escaping destruction.
The so-called needle-fish (or pipe-fish) is late in spawning,
and the greater portion of them are burst asunder by the
eggs before spawning; and the eggs are not so many in
number as large in size.9 The young fish cluster round the
5 parent like so many young spiders, for the fish spawns on

to herself; and, if any one touch the young, they swim
away. The atherine spawns by rubbing its belly against
the sand.
Tunny fish also burst asunder by reason of their fat.
They live for two years ;1 and the fishermen infer this age
from the circumstance that once when there was a failure of
the young tunny fish for a year there was a failure of the 10
full-grown tunny the next summer.2 They are of opinion
that the tunny is a fish a year older than the pelamyd.
The tunny and the mackerel 3 pair about the close of the
month of Elaphebolion,4 and spawn about the commence¬
ment of the month of Hecatombaeon ;5 they deposit their
spawn in a sort of bag.6 The growth of the young tunny is
rapid. After the females have spawned in the Euxine, there 15
comes from the egg what some call scordylae, but what the
Byzantines nickname the ‘ auxids * or £ growers ’, from their
growing to a considerable size in a few days ; these fish go
out of the Pontus in autumn along with the young tunnies,
and enter Pontus in the spring as pelamyds. Fishes as a
rule take on growth with rapidity,7 but this is peculiarly 20
the case with all species of fish found in the Pontus ; the
growth, for instance, of the amia-tunny 8 is quite visible
from day to day.
To resume, we must bear in mind that the same fish in the
same localities have not the same season for pairing, for
conception, for parturition, or for favouring weather. The 25
coracine, for instance, in some places spawns about wheat
harvest. The statements here given pretend only to give
the results of general observation.
The conger also spawns, but the fact is not equally
obvious in all localities, nor is the spawn plainly visible
owing to the fat of the fish ; for the spawn is lanky in shape
as it is with serpents. However, if it be put on the fire it 3°

shows its nature; for the fat evaporates and melts, while
the eggs dance about and explode with a crack. Further,
if you touch the substances and rub them with your fingers,
the fat feels smooth and the egg rough. Some congers are
57ib provided with fat but not with any spawn, others are un¬
provided with fat but have egg-spawn as here described.
We have, then, treated pretty fully of the animals 18
that fly in the air or swim in the water, and of such of
those that walk on dry land as are oviparous, to wit of their
5 pairing, conception, and the like phenomena ; it now remains
to treat of the same phenomena in connexion with viviparous
land animals and with man.
The statements made in regard to the pairing of the sexes
apply partly to the particular kinds of animal and partly to
all in general. It is common to all animals to be most
excited by the desire of one sex for the other and by the
io pleasure derived from copulation. The female is most
cross-tempered just after parturition, the male during the
time of pairing; for instance, stallions at this period bite
one another, throw their riders, and chase them. Wild
boars,1 though usually enfeebled at this time as the result
of copulation, are now unusually fierce, and fight with one
15 another in an extraordinary way, clothing themselves with
defensive armour, or in other words deliberately thickening
their hide by rubbing against trees or by coating themselves
repeatedly all over with mud and then drying themselves
in the sun. They drive one another away from the swine
20 pastures, and fight with such fury that very often both com¬
batants succumb. The case is similar with bulls, rams, and
he-goats ; for, though at ordinary times they herd together,
at breeding time they hold aloof from and quarrel with one
another. The male camel also is cross-tempered at pairing
25 time if either a man or a camel comes near him ; as for a
horse,2 a camel is ready to fight him at any time. It is the
same with wild animals. The bear, the wolf, and the lion

are all at this time ferocious towards such as come in their
way, but the males of these animals are less given to fight
with one another from the fact that they are at no time
gregarious. The she-bear is fierce after cubbing, and the 30
bitch after pupping.
Male elephants get savage about pairing time, and for
this reason it is stated that men who have charge of elephants
in India never allow the males to have intercourse with the
females ; on the ground that the males go wild at this
time and turn topsy-turvy the dwellings of their keepers, 572*
lightly constructed as they are, and commit all kinds of
havoc. They also state that abundancy of food has a
tendency to tame the males.1 They further introduce other
elephants amongst the wild ones, and punish and break
them in by setting on the new-comers to chastise the
others.
Animals that pair frequently and not at a single specific 5
season, as for instance animals domesticated by man, such
as swine and dogs, are found to indulge in such freaks to a
lesser degree owing to the frequency of their sexual inter¬
course.
Of female animals the mare is the most sexually wanton,
and next in order comes the cow. In fact, the mare is said
to go a-horsing ;2 and the term derived from the habits of 10
this one animal serves as a term of abuse applicable to such
females of the human species as are unbridled in the way of
sexual appetite. This is the common phenomenon as
observed in the sow when she is said to go a-boaring.3 The
mare is said also about this time to get wind-impregnated
if not impregnated by the stallion,4 and for this reason in

A. iv. 5. 773b 25. 3 I have transposed this sentence, which in the MSS. and edd. follows the next. 4 The fable of mares impregnated by the wind is widespread. Cf. Varro, R. R. ii.

Crete they never remove the stallion from the mares ; for
when the mare gets into this condition she runs away from
15 all other horses. The mares under these circumstances
fly invariably either northwards or southwards, and never
towards either east or west. When this complaint is on
them they allow no one to approach, until either they are
exhausted with fatigue 1 or have reached the sea. Under
either of these circumstances they discharge a certain sub
20 stance called ‘ hippomanes ’, the title given to a growth on
a new-born foal;2 this resembles the sow-virus, and is in
great request amongst women who deal in drugs and potions.
About horsing time the mares huddle closer together, are
continually switching their tails, their neigh is abnormal in
25 sound, and from the sexual organ there flows a liquid
resembling genital sperm, but much thinner than the sperm
of the male. It is this substance that some call hippo¬
manes, instead of the growth found on the foal ; they say it
is extremely difficult to get as it oozes out only in small
drops at a time. Mares also, when in heat, discharge
30 urine frequently, and frisk with one another. Such are the
phenomena connected with the horse.
Cows go a-bulling ; and so completely are they under
the influence of the sexual excitement that the herdsmen
have no control over them and cannot catch hold of them

in the fields. Mares and kine alike, when in heat, indicate
the fact by the upraising of their genital organs, and by
continually voiding urine. Further, kine mount the bulls,
follow them about, and keep standing beside them. The
younger females both with horses and oxen are the first to 5
get in heat; and their sexual appetites are all the keener if
the weather be warm and their bodily condition be healthy.
Mares, when dipt of their coat, have the sexual feeling
checked, and assume a downcast drooping appearance.1
The stallion recognizes by the scent the mares that form id
his company, even though they have been together only a
few days before breeding time : if they get mixed up with
other mares,2 the stallion bites and drives away the inter¬
lopers. He feeds apart, accompanied by his own troop of
mares. Each stallion has assigned to him about thirty
mares or even somewhat more ; when a strange stallion
approaches, he huddles his mares into a close ring, runs 15
round them, then advances to the encounter of the new¬
comer ; if one of the mares make a movement, he bites
her and drives her back. The bull in breeding time
begins to graze with the cows, and fights with other
bulls (having hitherto grazed with them), which is termed
by graziers ‘ herd-spurning \3 Often in Epirus a bull dis¬
appears for three months together. In a general way one 20
may state that of male4 animals either none or few herd
with their respective females before breeding time ; but
they keep separate after reaching maturity, and the two
sexes feed apart. Sows, when they are moved by sexual
desire, or are, as it is called, a-boaring, will attack even
human beings.
With bitches the same sexual condition is termed 25
‘ getting into heat ’. The sexual organ rises at this time,
and there is a moisture about the parts. Mares drip with
a white liquid at this season.
Female animals are subject to menstrual discharges, but

30 never in such abundance as is the female of the human
species. With ewes and she-goats there are signs of men¬
struation in breeding time, just before the time for submit¬
ting to the male; after copulation also the signs are
manifest, and then cease for an interval until the period of
573a parturition arrives ; the process then supervenes, and it is
by this supervention that the shepherd knows that such
and such an ewe is about to bring forth. After parturition
comes copious menstruation, not at first much tinged with
blood, but deeply dyed with it by and by. With the cow,
the she-ass, and the mare, the -discharge is more copious
5 actually, owing to their greater bulk, but proportionally to
the greater bulk it is far less copious. The cow, for instance,
when in heat, exhibits a small discharge to the extent of
a quarter of a pint of liquid or a little less ; and the time
when this discharge takes place is the best time for her to
be covered by the bull. Of all quadrupeds the mare is
the most easily delivered of its young, exhibits the least
10 amount of discharge after parturition, and emits the least
amount of blood ; that is to say, of all animals in propor¬
tion to size. With kine and mares menstruation usually
manifests itself at intervals of two, four, and six months ;1
but, unless one be constantly attending to and thoroughly
acquainted with such animals, it is difficult to verify the
circumstance, and the result is that many people are under
the belief that the process never takes place with these
animals at all.
15 With mules menstruation never takes place, but the urine
of the female is thicker than the urine of the male. As a
general rule the discharge from the bladder in the case of
quadrupeds is thicker than it is in the human species, and
this discharge with ewes and she-goats is thicker than with
rams and lie-goats ; but the urine of the jackass is thicker
20 than the urine of the she-ass, and the urine of the bull is
more pungent than the urine of the cow. After parturition
the urine of all quadrupeds becomes thicker, especially with
1 Gaza translates otherwise, ‘ Conceptus indicium maximum cum menses cessaverunt spatio temporis trimestri,’ &c.; and Scaliger similarly.


 BOOK VI. 18 573
such animals as exhibit comparatively slight discharges.
At breeding time the milk becomes purulent,1 but after
parturition it becomes wholesome. During pregnancy ewes 25
and she-goats get fatter and eat more; as is also the case
with cows, and, indeed, with the females of all quadrupeds.
In general the sexual appetites of animals are keenest in
spring-time; the time of pairing, however, is not the same
for all, but is adapted so as to ensure the rearing of the
young at a convenient season. 30
Domesticated swine carry their young for four months,
and bring forth a litter of twenty at the utmost; and, by
the way, if the litter be exceedingly numerous they cannot
rear all the young. As the sow grows old she continues to
bear, but grows indifferent to the boar ; she conceives after
a single copulation, but they have to put the boar to her
repeatedly owing to her dropping after intercourse what is 573
called the sow-virus.^ This incident befalls all sows, but
some of them discharge the genital sperm as well. During
conception any one of the litter that gets injured or dwarfed
is called an after-pig or scut :3 such injury may occur at 5
any part of the womb. After littering the mother offers
the foremost teat to the first-born. When the sow is in heat,
she must not at once be put to the boar, but only after she
lets her lugs drop, for otherwise she is apt to get into heat
again; if she be put to the boar when in full condition of
heat, one copulation, as has been said, is sufficient. It is as
well to supply the boar at the period of copulation with 10
barley, and the sow at the time of parturition with boiled
barley. Some swine give fine litters only at the beginning,
with others the litters improve as the mothers grow in age
and size. It is said that a sow, if she have one of her eyes
knocked out, is almost sure to die soon afterwards.4 Swine 15
for the most part live for fifteen years, but some fall little
short of the twenty.5

ram. If rain falls after intercourse, the ram impregnates
the ewe again ;1 and it is the same with the she-goat. The
20 ewe bears usually two lambs, sometimes three or four.
Both ewe and she-goat carry their young for five months ;
consequently wherever a district is sunny and the animals
are used to comfort and well fed, they bear twice in the
year. The goat lives for eight years and the sheep
for ten, but in most cases not so long; the bell-wether,
25 however, lives to fifteen years. In every flock they
train one of the rams for bell-wether.2 When he
is called on by name by the shepherd, he takes the
lead of the flock: and to this duty the creature is
trained from its earliest years. Sheep in Ethiopia live for
twelve or thirteen years, goats for ten .or eleven.3 In the
30 case of the sheep and the goat the two sexes have inter¬
course all their lives long.
Twins with sheep and goats may be due to richness of
pasturage, or to the fact that either the ram or the he-goat is
a twin-begetter or that the ewe or the she-goat is a twin
bearer.4 Of these animals some give birth to males and
others to females ; and the difference in this respect depends
on the waters they drink and also on the sires. And if they
submit to the male when north winds are blowing, they
574h are apt to bear males; if when south winds are blowing,
females.5 Such as bear females may get to bear males, due
regard being paid to their looking northwards when put to
the male. Ewes accustomed to be put to the ram early
will refuse him if he attempt to mount them late. Lambs
5 are born white and black according as white or black veins
are under the ram’s tongue ; the lambs are white if the
veins are white, and black if the veins are black, and white

veins are red.1 The females that drink salted waters are
the first to take the male; the water should be salted
before and after parturition, and again in the spring-time.2 10
With goats the shepherds appoint no bell-wether, as the
animal is not capable of repose but frisky and apt to
ramble. If at the appointed season the elders of the flock
are eager for intercourse, the shepherds say that it bodes
well for the flock;p* if the younger ones, that the flock is
going to be bad. ‘5
20 Of dogs there are several breeds. Of these the Laconian
hound of either sex is fit for breeding purposes when eight
months old: at about the same age some dogs lift the leg
when voiding urine. The bitch conceives with one lining ;
this is clearly seen in the case where a dog contrives to line
a bitch by stealth, as they impregnate after mounting only 20
once.4 The Laconian bitch carries her young the sixth
part of a year or sixty days: or more by one, two, or
three, or less by one;5 the pups are blind for twelve days
after birth. After pupping, the bitch gets in heat again
in six months, but not before. Some bitches carry their
young for the fifth part of the year or for seventy-two
days; and their pups are blind for fourteen days. Other
bitches carry their young for *a quarter of a year or for three
whole months; and the whelps of these are blind for
seventeen days.6 The bitch appears to go in heat for the 30
same length of time. Menstruation continues for seven
days, and a swelling of the genital organ occurs simul¬
taneously ; it is not during this period that the bitch is
disposed to submit to the dog, but in the seven days that
follow. The bitch as a rule goes in heat for fourteen days, 574b
but occasionally for sixteen. The birth-discharge occurs

simultaneously with the delivery of the whelps, and the
5 substance of it is thick and mucous. [The falling-off in
bulk on the part of the mother is not so great as might
have been inferred from the size of her frame.]1 The
bitch is usually supplied with milk five days before parturi¬
tion ; some seven days previously, some four ; and the
io milk is serviceable immediately after birth. The Laconian
bitch is supplied with milk thirty days after lining. The
milk at first is thickish, but gets thinner by degrees ; with
the bitch the milk is thicker than with the female of any
other animal excepting the sow and the hare. When the
bitch arrives at full growth an indication is given of her
capacity for the male; that is to say, just as occurs in the
*5 female of the human species, a swelling takes place in the
teats of the breasts, and the breasts take on gristle.2 This
incident, however, it is difficult for any but an expert to
detect, as the part that gives the indication is inconsider¬
able. The preceding statements relate to the female, and
not one of them to the male. The male as a rule lifts his
20 leg to void urine when six months old ; some at a later
period, when eight months old, some before they reach six
months. In a general way one may put it that they do so
when they are out of puppyhood.3 The bitch squats down
when she voids urine ; it is a rare exception that she lifts
25 the leg to do so. The bitch bears twelve pups at the most,
but usually five or six ; occasionally a bitch will bear one
only. The bitch of the Laconian breed generally bears
eight.4 The two sexes have intercourse with each other
at all periods of life.5 A very remarkable phenomenon is
observed in the case of the Laconian hound: in other
words, he is found to be more vigorous in commerce with

the female after being hard-worked than when allowed
to live idle.1
The dog of the Laconian breed lives ten years, and the 30
bitch twelve. The bitch of other breeds usually lives for
fourteen or fifteen years, but some live to twenty ; and for
this reason certain critics consider that Homer did well in
representing the dog of Ulysses as having died in his 575a
twentieth year.2 With the Laconian hound, owing to the
hardships to which the male is put, he is less long-lived
than the female; with other breeds the distinction as to
longevity is not very apparent, though as a general rule
the male is the longer-lived.
The dog sheds no teeth except the so-called ‘ canines ’; 5
these a dog of either sex sheds when four months old.3 As
they shed these only, many people are in doubt as to the
fact, and some people, owing to their shedding but two and
its being hard to hit upon the time when they do so, fancy
that the animal sheds no teeth at all; others, after observing
the shedding of two, come to the conclusion that the
creature sheds the rest in due turn. Men discern the age 10
of a dog by inspection of its teeth ; with young dogs the
teeth are white and sharp pointed, with old dogs black
and blunted.4
21 The bull impregnates the cow at a single mount, and
mounts with such vigour as to weigh down the cow ; if his
effort be unsuccessful, the cow must be allowed an interval
of twenty days before being again submitted.5 Bulls of «5
mature age decline to mount the same cow several times
on one day, except, by the way, at considerable intervals.
Young bulls by reason of their vigour are enabled to
mount the same cow several times in one day, and a good
many cows besides. The bull is the least salacious of
male animals. . . .6 The victor among the bulls is the one 20

that mounts the females ; when he gets exhausted by his
amorous efforts, his beaten antagonist sets on him and very
often gets the better of the conflict. The bull and the cow
are about a year old when it is possible for them to have
commerce with chance of offspring: as a rule, however,
they are about twenty months old, but it is universally
allowed that they are capable in this respect at the age of
25 two years. The cow goes with calf for nine months, and
she calves in the tenth month ; some maintain that they go
in calf for ten months, to the very day. A calf delivered
before the times here specified is an abortion and never
lives, however little premature its birth may have been, as its
hooves are weak and imperfect. The cow as a rule bears
30 but one calf, very seldom two; she submits to the bull and
bears as long as she lives.
Cows live for about fifteen years, and the bulls too, if
they have been castrated ; but some live for twenty years
or even more, if their bodily constitutions be sound. The
575b herdsmen tame the castrated bulls, and give them an office
in the herd analogous to the office of the bell-wether in
a flock; and these bulls live to an exceptionally advanced
age, owing to their exemption 1 from hardship and to their
browsing on pasture of good quality. The bull is in fullest
vigour when five years old, which leads the critics to com
5 mend Homer for applying to the bull the epithets of ‘ five
year-old ’, or £ of nine seasons which epithets are alike in
meaning.2 The ox sheds his teeth at the age of two years,
not all together but just as the horse sheds his.3 When
the animal suffers from podagra it does not shed the hoof,
but is subject to a painful swelling in the feet. The milk
10 of the cow is serviceable after parturition, and before
parturition there is no milk at all.4 The milk that first
presents itself becomes as hard as stone when it clots; this
result ensues unless it be previously diluted with water.
Oxen younger than a year old do not copulate unless

under circumstances of an unnatural and portentous kind :
instances have been recorded of copulation in both sexes
at the age of four1 months. Kine in general begin to
submit to the male about the month of Thargelion or of 15
Scirophorion ;2 some, however, are capable of conception
right on to the autumn.3 When kine in large numbers
receive the bull and conceive, it is looked upon as prognostic
of rain and stormy weather.4 Kine herd together like mares,
but in lesser degree. 20
22 In the case of horses, the stallion and the mare are first
fitted for breeding purposes w hen two years old. Instances,
however, of such early maturity are rare, and their young
are exceptionally small and w eak; the ordinary age for
sexual maturity is three years, and from that age to
twenty the two sexes go on improving in the quality of 25
their offspring.5 The mare carries her foal for eleven
months, and casts it in the twelfth.0 It is not a fixed
number of days that the stallion takes to impregnate the
mare ; it may be one, two, three, or more. An ass in
covering will impregnate more expeditiously than a stallion.
The act of intercourse with horses is not laborious as it is 3°
with oxen. In both sexes the horse is the most salacious
of animals next after the human species.7 The breeding
faculties of the younger horses may be stimulated beyond
their years if they be supplied with good feeding in
abundance. The mare as a rule bears only one foal ; 76a
occasionally she has two, but never more. A mare has
been known to cast two mules ; but such a circumstance
was regarded as unnatural and portentous.
The horse then is first fitted for breeding purposes at the
age of two and a half years, but achieves full sexual
maturity when it has ceased to shed teeth, except it be
naturally infertile ; it must be added, however, that some 5

 HISTORIA ANIMALIUM
horses have been known to impregnate the mare while the
teeth were in process of shedding.
The horse has forty teeth. It sheds its first set of four,
two from the upper jaw and two from the lower, when two
and a half years old. After a year’s interval, it sheds
another set of four in like manner, and another set of four
after yet another year’s interval ; after arriving at the age
of four years and six months it sheds no more. An
instance has occurred where a horse shed all his teeth at
once, and another instance of a horse shedding all his teeth
with his last set of four ; but such instances are very rare.1
It consequently happens that a horse when four and a half
years old is in excellent condition for breeding purposes.
The older horses, whether of the male or female, are the
more generatively productive. Horses will cover mares
from which they have been foaled and mares which
they have begotten ;2 and, indeed, a troop of horses is
only considered perfect when such promiscuity of inter¬
course occurs. Scythians use pregnant mares for riding
when the embryo has turned rather soon in the womb, and
they assert that thereby the mothers have all the easier
delivery. Quadrupeds as a rule lie down for parturition,
and in consequence the young of them all come out of the
womb sideways. The mare, however, when the time for
parturition arrives, stands erect and in that posture casts its
foal.3
The horse in general lives for eighteen or twenty years ;
some horses live for twenty-five or even thirty,4 and if
a horse be treated with extreme care, it may last on to the
age of fifty years ; a horse, however, when it reaches thirty
years is regarded as exceptionally old. The mare lives
usually for twenty-five years, though instances have
occurred of their attaining the age of forty.’’ The male is

reared in a private stable live longer than such as are reared
in troops. The mare attains hei full length and height at
five years old, the stallion at six ; in another six years the 5
animal reaches its full bulk, and goes on improving until it
is twenty years old. The female, then, reaches maturity
more rapidly than the male, but in the womb the case is
reversed, just as is observed in regard to the sexes of the
human species ;1 and the same phenomenon is observed in
the case of all animals that bear several young.2 to
The mare is said to suckle a mule-foal for six months,
but not to allow its approach for any longer on account of
the pain it is put to by the hard tugging 3 of the young; an
ordinary foal it allows to suck for a longer period.
Horse and mule are at their best after the shedding of
the teeth. After they have shed them all, it is not easy to
distinguish their age ; hence they are said to carry their
mark before the shedding, but not after. However, even 15
after the shedding their age is pretty well recognized by
the aid of the canines; for in the case of horses much
ridden these teeth are worn away by attrition caused by
the insertion of the bit; in the case of horses not ridden
the teeth are large and detached, and in young horses they
are sharp and small.4
The male of the horse will breed at all seasons and during 2o
its whole life; the mare can take the horse all its life long,
but is not thus5 * * ready to pair at all seasons unless it be

25 render difficult the rearing of the future progeny. In a
stable in Opus there was a stallion that used to serve mares
when forty years old :1 his fore legs had to be lifted up
for the operation.
Mares first take the horse in the spring-time. After a
mare has foaled she does not get impregnated at once
again, but only after a considerable interval; in fact, the
foals will be all the better if the interval extend over four
or five years. It is, at all events, absolutely necessary to
577a allow an interval of one year, and for that period to let her
lie fallow.2 A mare, then, breeds at intervals; a she-ass
breeds on and on without intermission. Of mares some are
absolutely sterile, others are capable of conception but in¬
capable of bringing the foal to full term ; it is said to be
5 an indication of this condition in a mare, that her foal if
dissected is found to have other kidney-shaped substances
round about its kidneys, presenting the appearance of having
four kidneys.3
After parturition the mare at once swallows the after-birth,
and bites off the growth,4 called the ‘ hippomanes ’,5 that is
found on the forehead of the foal. This growth is some
10 what smaller than a dried fig ; and in shape is broad and
round, and in colour black. If any bystander gets posses¬
sion of it6 before the mare, and the mare gets a smell of it,
she goes wild and frantic at the smell.7 And it is for this
reason that venders of drugs and simples hold the substance
in high request and include it among their stores.
If an ass cover a mare after the mare has been covered by
a horse, the ass will destroy the previously formed embryo.s
15 [ Horse-trainers do not appoint a horse as leader to a
troop, as herdsmen appoint a bull as leader to a herd,
and for this reason that the horse is not steady but quick¬
tempered and skittish.] 9

 BOOK VI. 23 577a
23 The ass of both sexes is capable of breeding, and sheds
its first teeth at the age of two and a half years ;1 it sheds
its second teeth within six months, its third within another
six months, and the fourth after the like interval. These 20
fourth teeth are termed the gnomons or age-indicators.
A she-ass has been known to conceive when a year old,
and the foal to be reared.2 After intercourse with the male
it will discharge the genital sperm unless it be hindered,
and for this reason it is usually beaten after such inter¬
course and chased about.3 It casts its young in the twelfth
month. It usually bears but one foal, and that is its 25
natural number; occasionally however it bears twins.4 The
ass if it cover a mare destroys, as has been said, the embryo
previously begotten by the horse; but, after the mare has
been covered by the ass, the horse supervening will not
spoil the embryo.5 The she-ass has milk in the tenth
month of pregnancy. Seven days after casting a foal the
she-ass submits to the male, and is almost sure to conceive
if put to the male on this particular day ; the same result, 30
however, is quite possible later on. The she-ass will refuse
to cast her foal with any one looking on or in the daylight, §77b
and just before foaling she has to be led away into a dark
place. If the she-ass has had young before the shedding
of the index-teeth, she will bear all her life through ;6 but if
not, then she will neither conceive nor bear for the rest of
her days. The ass lives for more than thirty years, and
the she-ass lives longer than the male. 5
When there is a cross between a horse and a she-ass or a
jackass and a mare, there is much greater chance of a mis¬
carriage than where the commerce is normal. The period
far gestation in the case of a cross depends on the male,
and is just what it would have been if the male had had
commerce with a female of his own kind. In regard to size, 10
looks, and vigour, the foal is more apt to resemble the
mother than the sire. If such hybrid connexions be con¬
tinued without intermittence, the female will soon go

sterile ;1 and for this reason trainers always allow of inter
15 vals between breeding times.2 A mare will not take the
ass, nor a she-ass the horse, unless the ass or she-ass shall
have been suckled by a mare; and for this reason trainers
put foals of the she-ass under mares, which foals are tech¬
nically spoken of as ‘ mare-suckled \3 These asses, thus
reared, mount the mares in the open pastures, mastering
them by force as the stallions do.
A mule is fitted for commerce with the female after the 24
jo first shedding of its teeth, and at the age of seven will
impregnate effectually ;4 and where connexion has taken
place with a mare, a 4 hinny ’ has been known to be produced.
After the seventh year it has no further intercourse with
the female.5 A female mule has been known to be im¬
pregnated, but without the impregnation being followed up
by parturition.6 In Syrophoenicia she-mules submit to the
mule and bear young;7 but the breed, though it resembles
J5 the ordinary one, is different and specific. The hinny or
stunted mule is foaled by a mare when she has gone sick
during gestation,8 and corresponds to the dwarf in the
human species and to the after-pig or scut in swine; and,
as is the case with dwarfs, the sexual organ of the hinny is
abnormally large.
The mule lives for a number of years. There are on record
cases of mules living to the age of eighty, as did one in
30 Athens at the time of the building of the temple ; this mule

on account of its age was let go free, but continued to
assist in dragging burdens, and would go side by side with
the other draught-beasts and stimulate them to their work ;
and in consequence a public decree was passed forbidding
any baker driving the creature away from his bread-tray.1 578
The she-mule grows old more slowly than the mule. Some
assert that the she-mule menstruates by the act of voiding
her urine,2 and that the mule owes the prematurity of his
decay to his habit of smelling at the urine. So much for
the modes of generation in connexion with these animals. 5
25 Breeders and trainers can distinguish between young and
old quadrupeds.3 If, when drawn back from the jaw, the
skin at once goes back to its place, the animal is young ; if
it remains long wrinkled up, the animal is old.
25 The camel carries its young for ten 1 months, and bears 10
but one at a time and never more; the young camel is
removed from the mother when a year old. The animal
lives for a long period, more than fifty years.5 It bears in
spring-time,0 and gives milk until the time of the next con¬
ception. Its flesh and milk are exceptionally palatable.1
The milk is drunk mixed with water in the proportion of 15
either two to one or three to one.
27 The elephant of either sex is fitted for breeding before
reaching the age of twenty. The female carries her young,
according to some accounts, for two and a half years ;
according to others, for three years ;8 and the discrepancy
in the assigned periods is due to the fact that there are 20
never human eyewitnesses to the commerce between the
sexes.9 The female settles down on its rear to cast its
young, and obviously suffers greatly during the process.

The young one, immediately after birth, sucks the mother,
not with its trunk but with the mouth ;1 and can walk about
and see distinctly the moment it is born.
25 The wild sow submits to the boar at the beginning of 28
winter, and in the spring-time retreats for parturition to a
lair in some district inaccessible to intrusion, hemmed in
with sheer cliffs and chasms and overshadowed by trees.
The boar usually remains by the sow for thirty days. The
number of the litter and the period of gestation is the same
30 as in the case of the domesticated congener. The sound of
the grunt also is similar ; only that the sow grunts con¬
tinually, and the boar but seldom. Of the wild boars such
as are castrated grow to the largest size and become fiercest:
578b to which circumstance Homer alludes when he says :
‘He reared against him a wild castrated boar: it was
not like a food-devouring brute, but like a forest-clad
promontory.’2
Wild boars become castrated owing to an itch befalling
them in early life in the region of the testicles, and the
5 castration is superinduced by their rubbing themselves
against the trunks of trees.
The hind, as has been stated, submits to the stag as a 29
rule only under compulsion,3 as she is unable to endure the
male often owing to the rigidity of the penis.4 However,
they do occasionally submit to the stag as the ewe submits
10 to the ram: and when they are in heat the hinds avoid one
another.5 The stag is not constant to one particular hind,
but after a while quits one and mates with others.6 The
breeding time is after the rising of Arcturus, during the
months of Boedromion and Maimacterion.7 The period of
gestation lasts for eight months. Conception comes on a

few days after intercourse ; and a number of hinds can be
impregnated by a single male. The hind, as a rule, bears 15
but one fawn, although instances have been known of her
casting two. Out of dread of wild beasts she casts her
young by the side of the high-road.1 The young fawn
grows with rapidity. Menstruation occurs at no other time
with the hind ; it takes place only after parturition, and
the substance is phlegm-like. 20
The hind leads the fawn to her lair; this is her place of
refuge, a cave with a single inlet, inside which she shelters
herself against attack.2
Fabulous stories are told concerning the longevity of the
animal, but the stories have never been verified, and the
brevity of the period of gestation and the rapidity of growth 25
in the fawn would not lead one to attribute extreme longevity
to this creature.
In the mountain called Elaphoeis3 or Deer Mountain,
which is in Arginussa in Asia Minor—the place, by the way,
where Alcibiades was assassinated 4—all the hinds have the5
ear split, so that, if they stray to a distance, they can be
recognized by this mark ; and the embryo actually has the
mark while yet in the womb of the mother. 3°
The hind has four teats like the cow. After the hinds
have become pregnant, the males all segregate one by one,
and in consequence of the violence of their sexual passions
they keep each one to himself, dig a hole in the ground, 579a
and bellow from time to time;6 in all these particulars they
resemble the goat, and their foreheads from getting wetted
become black,7 as is also the case with the goat. In this

way they pass the time until the rain falls, after which time
they turn to pasture. The animal acts in this way owing to
its sexual wantonness and also to its obesity; for in summer¬
time it becomes so exceptionally fat as to be unable to run :
in fact at this period they can be overtaken by the hunters
that pursue them on foot in the second or third run; and,
by the way, in consequence of the heat of the weather and
their getting out of breath they always make for water in
their runs.1 In the rutting season, the flesh of the deer is
unsavoury and rank, like the flesh of the he-goat. In winter¬
time the deer becomes thin and weak, but towards the
approach of the spring he is at his best for running. When
on the run the deer keeps pausing from time to time, and
waits until his pursuer draws upon him, whereupon he starts
off again. This habit appears due to some internal pain :
at all events, the gut is so slender and weak that, if you
strike the animal ever so softly, it is apt to break
asunder, though the hide of the animal remains sound and
uninjured.2
Bears,3 as has been previously stated, do not copulate 30
with the male mounting the back of the female, but with
the female lying down under the male. The she-bear goes
with young for thirty days.4 She brings forth sometimes
one cub, sometimes two cubs, and at most five. Of all
animals the newly born cub of the she-bear is the smallest
in proportion to the size of the mother; that is to say, it is
larger than a mouse but smaller than a weasel. It is also
smooth and blind, and its legs and most of its organs are
as yet inarticulate.5 Pairing takes place in the month of
1 Elaphebolion,6 and parturition about the time for retiring
into winter quarters;7 about this time the bear and the
she-bear are at the fattest. After the she-bear has reared

her young, she comes out of her winter lair in the third
month, when it is already spring.1 The female porcupine,
by the way, hibernates and goes with young the same
number of days as the she-bear, and in all respects as to
parturition resembles this animal. When a she-bear is with
young, it is a very hard task to catch her. 30
31 It has already been stated that the lion and lioness
copulate rearwards,2 and that these animals are opisthuretic.
They do not copulate nor bring forth at all seasons indis¬
criminately, but once in the year only. The lioness brings
forth in the spring, generally two cubs at a time, and six at 579b
the very most ; but sometimes only one. The story about
the lioness discharging her womb in the act of parturition 3
is a pure fable, and was merely invented to account for the
scarcity of the animal; for the animal is, as is well known, 5
a rare animal, and is not found in many countries. In fact,
in the whole of Europe it is only found in the strip between
the rivers Achelous and Nessus.4 The cubs of the lioness
when newly born are exceedingly small, and can scarcely
walk when two months old.5 6 The Syrian lion bears cubs
five times : five cubs at the first litter, then four, then three, 10
then two, and lastly one ; after this the lioness ceases to
bear for the rest of her days.0 The lioness has no mane,
but this appendage is peculiar to the lion. The lion sheds
only the four so-called canines,7 two in the upper jaw and
two in the lower ; and it sheds them when it is six months
old.

shaggy, and is furnished with a mane running all along the
spine. What is recounted concerning its genital organs, to
the effect that every hyena is furnished with the organ both of
the male and the female, is untrue.1 The fact is that the sexual
organ of the male hyena resembles the same organ in the
wolf and in the dog ; the part resembling the female genital
20 organ lies underneath the tail, and does to some extent
resemble the female organ, but it is unprovided with duct or
passage, and the passage for the residuum comes underneath
it. The female hyena has the part that resembles the
organ of the male, and, as in the case of the male, has it
underneath her tail, unprovided with duct or passage; and
25 after it the passage for the residuum, and underneath this
the true female genital organ. The female hyena has a
womb, like all other female animals of the same kind. It
is an exceedingly rare circumstance to meet with a female
hyena. At least a hunter said that out of eleven hyenas he
had caught, only one was a female.
30 Hares copulate in a rearward posture, as has been 33
stated,2 for the animal is opisthuretic. They breed and
bear at all seasons, superfoetate during pregnancy,3 and
bear young every month. They do not give birth to
their young ones all together at one time, but bring them
58oa forth at intervals over as many days as the circumstances
of each case may require. The female is supplied with
milk before parturition ; and after bearing submits imme¬
diately to the male, and is capable of conception while
suckling her young. The milk in consistency resembles
sow’s milk. The young are born blind, as is the case with
5 the greater part of the fissipeds or toed animals.4
The fox mounts 5 the vixen in copulation, and the vixen 34
bears young like the she-bear;6 in fact, her young ones

are even more inarticulately formed. Before parturition
she retires to sequestered places, so that it is a great rarity
for a vixen to be caught while pregnant. After parturition
she warms her young and gets them into shape by licking
them.1 She bears four at most at a birth. 10
35 The wolf resembles the dog in regard to the time of
conception and parturition, the number of the litter, and
the blindness of the new-born young. The sexes couple
at one special period, and the female brings forth at the
beginning of the summer. There is an account given of the 15
parturition of the she-wolf that borders on the fabulous, to
the effect that she confines her lying-in to within twelve par¬
ticular days of the year.2 And they give the reason for this
in the form of a myth, viz. that when they transported Leto
in so many days from the land of the Hyperboreans to the
island of Delos, she assumed the form of a she-wolf to escape
the anger of Here. Whether the account be correct or not 20
has not yet been verified ; I give it merely as it is currently
told. There is no more of truth in the current statement
that the she-wolf bears once and only once in her lifetime.
The cat and the ichneumon bear as many young as
the dog, and live on the same food ; they live about six
% years. The cubs of the panther are born blind like those
of the wolf, and the female bears four at the most at one 25
birth. The particulars of conception are the same for
the thos, or civet, as for the dog ; the cubs of the animal
are born blind, and the female bears two, or three, or four
at a birth. It is long in the body and low in stature;3
but notwithstanding the shortness of its legs it is excep- 3°
tionally fleet of foot, owing to the suppleness of its frame
and its capacity for leaping.

same as the cross between the horse and ass, but resembles
it just as a wild ass resembles the domesticated congener,
and derives its name from the resemblance. Like the wild
5 ass, this wild mule is remarkable for its speed. The •
animals of this species interbreed with one another; and
a proof of this statement may be gathered from the fact
that a certain number of them were brought into Phrygia
in the time of Pharnaces, the father of Pharnabazus, and
the animal is there still. The number originally intro¬
duced was nine, and there are three there at the present
day.
io The phenomena of generation in regard to the mouse 37
are the most astonishing both for the number of the young
and for the rapidity of recurrence in the births. On one
occasion a she-mouse in a state of pregnancy was shut up
by accident in a jar containing millet-seed, and after a
little while the lid of the jar was removed and upwards of
one hundred and twenty mice were found inside it.
15 The rate of propagation of field mice in country places,
and the destruction that they cause, are beyond all telling.
In many places their number is so incalculable that but
very little of the corn-crop is left to the farmer; and so
rapid is their mode of proceeding that sometimes a small
farmer will one day observe that it is time for reaping, and
on the following morning, when he takes his reapers afield,
20he finds his entire crop devoured.1 Their disappearance
is unaccountable: in a few days not a mouse will there be
to be seen. And yet in the time before these few days
men fail to keep down their numbers by fumigating2 and
unearthing them, or by regularly hunting them and turning
in swine upon them ; for pigs, by the way, turn up the
25 mouse-holes by rooting with their snouts. Foxes also hunt

I ; Colum. vii. 37, &c. 1 Plagues of field-mice or voles, Arvicola giint/ieri, still occur in Thessaly, e. g. in 1866 and 1S92: see Report on a Plague of FieldVoles in Scotland, 1893 (Cd. 943). A similar occurrence is alluded to in 1 Sam. v. 6, vi. 11. 2 Cf. Pallad. i. 35. 10 1 talpas fugat impletis fumo nucis [qy. picis] incensac cuniculis ’; see also Gcopon. xiii. 7.

them, and the wild ferrets in particular destroy them, but
they make no way against the prolific qualities of the animal
and the rapidity of its breeding. When they are super¬
abundant, nothing succeeds in thinning them down except
the rain ; but after heavy rains they disappear rapidly.
In a certain district of Persia when a female mouse is 30
dissected the female embryos appear to be pregnant.1 Some
people assert, and positively assert, that a female mouse by
licking salt2 can become pregnant without the intervention s8ia
of the male.
Mice in Egypt are covered with bristles like the hedge¬
hog.3 There is also a different breed of mice that walk on
their two hind-legs; their front legs are small and their
hind-legs long;4 the breed is exceedingly numerous.
There are many other breeds of mice than are here
referred to. 5

 BOOK VII
58ia 1 As to Man's growth, first within his mother’s womb and i
io afterward to old age, the course of nature, in so far as man
is specially concerned, is after the following manner. And,
by the way, the difference of male and female and of their
respective organs has been dealt with heretofore.1 2 When
twice seven years old,3 in the most of cases, the male
begins to engender seed ; and at the same time hair
15 appears upon the pubes,4 in like manner, so Alcmaeon of
Croton remarks, as plants first blossom and then seed.
About the same time, the voice begins to alter,5 6 getting
harsher and more uneven, neither shrill as formerly nor
deep as afterward, nor yet of any even tone, but like an
20 instrument whose strings are frayed and out of tune; and
it is called, by way of by-word, the bleat of the billy-goat.G
Now this breaking of the voice is the more apparent in
those who are making trial of their sexual powers; for in
those who are prone to lustfulness the voice turns into the
voice of a man, but not so in the continent. For if a lad
strive diligently to hinder his voice from breaking, as some
25 do of those who devote themselves to music, the voice lasts

a long while unbroken and may even persist with little
change. And the breasts swell and likewise the private
parts,, altering in size and shape. (And by the way, at this
time of life those who try by friction to provoke emission
of seed 1 are apt to experience pain as well as voluptuous 30
sensations.) At the same age in the female, the breasts
swell and the so-called catamenia commence to flow; and 58ib
this fluid resembles fresh blood. There is another discharge,
a white one, by the way, which occurs in girls even at
a very early age, more especially if their diet be largely of
a fluid nature ; and this malady causes arrest of growth and
loss of flesh.2 In the majority of cases the catamenia are 5
noticed by the time the breasts have grown to the height
of two fingers’ breadth.3 In girls, too, about this time the
voice changes to a deeper note ; for while in general the
woman’s voice is higher than the man’s, so also the voices
of girls are pitched in a higher key than the elder women’s,
just as the boy’s are higher than the men’s; and the girls’ 10
voices are shriller than the boys’, and a maid’s flute is
tuned sharper than a lad’s.4
Girls of this age have much need of surveillance. For
then in particular they feel a natural impulse to make
usage of the sexual faculties that are developing in them;
so that unless they guard against any further impulse beyond
that inevitable one which their bodily development of itself
supplies, even in the case of those who abstain altogether 15
from passionate indulgence, they contract habits which
are apt to continue into later life.5 For girls who give way
to wantonness grow more and more wanton ; and the same
is true of boys, unless they be safeguarded from one
temptation and another; for the passages become dilated
and set up a local flux or running,6 and besides this the 20
recollection of pleasure associated with former indulgence
creates a longing for its repetition.
Some men are congenitally impotent owing to structural
defect ; and in like manner women also may suffer from

 HISTORIA ANIMALIUM
congenital incapacity. Both men and women are liable to
constitutional change, growing healthier or more sickly, or
altering in the way of leanness, stoutness, and vigour; thus,
after puberty some lads who were thin before grow stout
and healthy, and the converse also happens ; and the same
is equally true of girls. For when in boy or girl the body
30 is loaded with superfluous matter, then, when such super¬
fluities are got rid of in the spermatic or catamenial dis¬
charge, their bodies improve in health and condition owing
582a to the removal of what had acted as an impediment to
health and proper nutrition ; but in such as are of opposite
habit their bodies become emaciated and out of health,
for then the spermatic discharge in the one case and the
catamenial flow in the other take place at the cost of
natural healthy conditions.
5 Furthermore, in the case of maidens the condition of
the breasts is diverse in different individuals, for they are
sometimes quite big and sometimes little ; and as a general
rule their size depends on whether or no the body was
burthened in childhood with superfluous material. For
when the signs of womanhood are nigh but not come, the
10 more there be of moisture the more will it cause the breasts
to swell, even to the bursting point; and the result is that
the breasts remain during after-life of the bulk that they
then acquired. And among men, the breasts grow more
conspicuous and more like to those of women, both in
young men and old, when the individual temperament is
15 moist and sleek and the reverse of sinewy, and all the more
among the dark-complexioned than the fair.
At the outset and till the age of one and twenty the
spermatic discharge is devoid of fecundity;1 afterwards it
becomes fertile, but young men and women produce under¬
sized and imperfect progeny, as is the case also with the
common run of animals.2 Young women conceive readily,
20 but, having conceived, their labour in childbed is apt to be
difficult.
The frame fails of reaching its full development and


 BOOK VII. i 5«2a
ages quickly in men of intemperate lusts and in women
who become mothers of many children ; for it appears to
be the case that growth ceases when the woman has given
birth to three children. Women of a lascivious disposition 25
grow more sedate and virtuous after they have borne
several children.
After the age of twenty-one women are fully ripe for
child-bearing, but men go on increasing in vigour. When
the spermatic fluid is of a thin consistency it is infertile ;
when granular it is fertile and likely to produce male 30
children, but when thin and unclotted it is apt to produce
female offspring. And it is about this time of life that in
men the beard makes its appearance.
2 The onset of the catamenia in women takes place towards
the end of the month ;1 and on this account the wiseacres
assert that the moon is feminine, because the discharge in 582b
women and the waning of the moon happen at one and the
same time, and after the wane and the discharge both one
and the other grow whole again. [In some women the
catamenia occur regularly but sparsely every month, and
more abundantly every third month.]2 With those in
whom the ailment lasts but a little while, two days or 5
three, recovery is easy; but where the duration is longer,
the ailment is more troublesome. For women are ailing
during these days; and sometimes the discharge is sudden
and sometimes gradual, but in all cases alike there is bodily
distress until the attack be over. In many cases at the
commencement of the attack, when the discharge is about
to appear, there occur spasms and rumbling noises within 10
the womb until such time as the discharge manifests itself.
Under natural conditions it is after recovery from these

symptoms that conception takes place in women,1 and
women in whom the signs do not manifest themselves for
the most part remain childless. But the rule is not without
exception,2 for some conceive in spite of the absence of
these symptoms ; and these are cases in which a secretion
accumulates, not in such a way as actually to issue forth,3
but in amount equal to the residuum left in the case of
child-bearing women 4 after the normal discharge has taken
place. And some conceive while the signs are on but not
afterwards, those namely in whom the womb closes up
immediately after the discharge. ' In some cases the menses
persist during pregnancy up to the very last; but the
result in these cases is that the offspring are poor, and
either fail to survive or grow up weakly.
In many cases, owing to excessive desire, arising either
from youthful impetuosity or from lengthened abstinence,
prolapsion of the womb takes place and the catamenia
appear repeatedly, thrice 5 6 in the month, until conception
occurs; and then the womb withdraws upwards again to
its proper place. . . .c

more abundant in women than in the females of any other
animals.1 In creatures that do not bring forth their young 30
alive nothing of the sort manifests itself, this particular
superfluity being converted into bodily substance; and by
the way, in such animals the females are sometimes larger
than the males; and moreover, the material is used up
sometimes for scutes and sometimes for scales, and some¬
times for the abundant covering of feathers, whereas in the
vivipara possessed of limbs it is turned into hair and into
bodily substance (for man alone among them is smooth- 5^3a
skinned), and into urine, for this excretion is in the majority
of such animals thick and copious. Only in the case of
women is the superfluity turned into a discharge instead of
being utilized in these other ways.
There is something similar to be remarked of men: for
in proportion to his size man emits more seminal fluid than 5
any other animal2 (for which reason man is the smoothest
of animals), especially such men as are of a moist habit and
not over corpulent, and fair men in greater degree than
dark. It is likewise with women; for in the stout, great
part of the excretion goes to nourish the body. In the act 10
of intercourse, women of a fair complexion discharge a
more plentiful secretion than the dark;3 and furthermore,
a watery and pungent diet conduces to this phenomenon.
3 It is a sign of conception in women when the place is
dry immediately after intercourse.4 If the lips of the 15
orifice be smooth conception is difficult, for the matter slips
off; and if they be thick it is also difficult. But if on
digital examination the lips feel somewhat rough and
adherent, and if they be likewise thin, then the chances are
in favour of conception. Accordingly, if conception be
desired, we must bring the parts into such a condition as 20
we have just described ; but if on the contrary we want to

avoid conception then wc must bring about a contrary dis¬
position. Wherefore, since if the parts be smooth concep¬
tion is prevented, some anoint that part of the womb on
which the seed falls with oil of cedar, or with ointment of
lead or with frankincense, commingled with olive oil.1 If
the seed remain within for seven days then it is certain
that conception has taken place;2 for it is during that period
2 5 that what is known as effluxion takes place.
In most cases the menstrual discharge recurs for some
time after conception has taken place, its duration being
mostly thirty days in the case of a female and about forty
days in the case of a male child. After parturition also it
is common for the discharge to be withheld for an equal
3° number of days, but not in all cases with equal exactitude.
After conception, and when the above-mentioned days are
past, the discharge no longer takes its natural course but
finds its way to the breasts and turns to milk. The first
appearance of milk in the breasts is scant in quantity and
so to speak cobwebby or interspersed with little threads.
And when conception has taken place, there is apt to be
a sort of feeling in the region of the flanks, which in some
583b cases quickly swell up a little, especially in thin persons,
and also in the groin.
In the case of male children the first movement usually
occurs on the right-hand side of the womb 3 and about the
fortieth day, but if the child be a female then on the left
5 hand side and about the ninetieth day. However, we must
by no means assume this to be an accurate statement of
fact, for there are many exceptions, in which the movement
is manifested on the right-hand side though a female child
be coming, and on the left-hand side though the infant be
a male. And in short, these and all suchlike phenomena
are usually subject to differences that may be summed up
as differences of degree.
About this period the embryo begins to resolve into
1 Cf. Hippocr. de Sterilit. Mul. iii. p. 38 K, viii. p.456 L; also Aetii Sermon. 13, cit. Schneider, iii. p. 535. 2 Hippocr. de Sept. P. vii. p. 446 L, i. p. 451 K. 3 Hippocr. Aphor. v. 48 (iv. p. 550 L, iii. p. 745 K); Plin. vii. 3.


 BOOK VII. 3 583b
distinct parts, it having hitherto consisted of a fleshlike io
substance without distinction of parts.
What is called effluxion is a destruction of the embryo
within the first week, while abortion occurs up to the
fortieth day; and the greater number of such embryos as
perish do so within the space of these forty days.1
In the case of a male embryo aborted at the fortieth day,
if it be placed in cold water it holds together in a sort of
membrane, but if it be placed in any other fluid it dissolves 15
and disappears. If the membrane be pulled to bits the
embryo is revealed, as big as one of the large kind of ants ;
and all the limbs are plain to see, including the penis, and
the eyes also, which as in other animals are of great size.
But the female embryo, if it suffer abortion during the first 20
three months, is as a rule found to be undifferentiated ; if
however it reach the fourth month it comes to be sub¬
divided and quickly attains further differentiation. In short,
while within the womb,2 the female infant accomplishes
the whole development of its parts more slowly than the
male, and more frequently than the man-child takes ten 25
months to come to perfection.3 But after birth, the females
pass more quickly than the males through youth and
maturity and age; and this is especially true of those that
bear many children, as indeed I have already said.
4 When the womb has conceived the seed, straightway in
the majority of cases it closes up until seven months are 30
fulfilled ; but in the eight month it opens, and the embryo,
if it be fertile, descends in the eighth month.4 But such
embryos as are not fertile but are devoid of breath at eight
months old, their mothers do not bring into the world by
parturition at eight months,5 neither does the embryo
descend within the womb at that period nor does the womb
open. And it is a sign that the embryo is not capable of 584"

life if it be formed without the above-named circumstances
taking place.
After conception women are prone to a feeling of heavi¬
ness in all parts of their bodies,1 and for instance they
experience a sensation of darkness in front of the eyes and
suffer also from headache. These symptoms appear sooner
5 or later, sometimes as early as the tenth day, according as
the patient be more or less burthened with superfluous
humours. Nausea also and sickness affect the most of
women, and especially such as those that we have just now
mentioned, after the menstrual discharge has ceased and
before it is yet turned in the direction of the breasts.
Moreover, some women suffer most at the beginning of
io their pregnancy and some at a later period when the
embryo has had time to grow; and in some women it is
a common occurrence to suffer from strangury towards the
end of their time. As a general rule women who are preg¬
nant of a male child escape comparatively easily and retain
a comparatively healthy look,2 but it is otherwise with those
whose infant is a female; for these latter look as a rule
i5 paler and suffer more pain, and in many cases they are
subject to swellings of the legs and eruptions on the body.
Nevertheless the rule is subject to exceptions.
Women in pregnancy are a prey to all sorts of longings
and to rapid changes of mood, and some folks call this
the ‘ ivy-sickness 3 and with the mothers of female
20 infants the longings are more acute, and they are less
contented when they have got what they desired.
In a certain few cases the patient feels unusually well
during pregnancy. The worst time of all is just when the
child’s hair is beginning to grow.
In pregnant women their own natural hair is inclined to
grow thin and fall out, but on the other hand hair tends
25 to grow on parts of the body where it was not wont to be.
As a general rule, a man-child is more prone to movement

within its mother’s womb than a female child, and it is
usually born sooner. And labour in the case of female
children is apt to be protracted and sluggish, while in the
case of male children it is acute and by a long way more
difficult. Women who have connexion with their husbands 30
shortly before childbirth are delivered all the more quickly.1
Occasionally women seem to be in the pains of labour
though labour has not in fact commenced, what seemed like
the commencement of labour being really the result of the
foetus turning its head.
Now all other animals bring the time of pregnancy to an
end in a uniform way; in other words, one single term of
pregnancy is defined for each of them.2 But in the case of 35
mankind alone of all animals the times are diverse; for
pregnancy may be of seven months’ duration, or of eight
months or of nine, and still more commonly of ten [lunar]
months,3 while some few women go even into the eleventh 584b
month.4
Children that come into the world before seven months
can under no circumstances survive.5 The seven-months’
children are the earliest that are capable of life, and most
of them are weakly—for which reason, by the way, it is
customary to swaddle them in wool,—and many of them
are born with some of the orifices of the body imperforate, 5
for instance the ears or the nostrils.6' But as they get bigger
they become more perfectly developed, and many of them
grow up.
In Egypt, and in some other places where the women are
fruitful and are wont to bear and bring forth many children

without difficulty, and where the children when born are
capable of living1 even if they be born subject to deformity,
io in these places the eight-months’ children live and are
brought up, but in Greece it is only a few of them that
survive while most perish.2 And this being the general
experience, when such a child does happen to survive the
mother is apt to think that it was not an eight-months’
child after all, but that she had conceived at an earlier
period without being aware of it.
15 Women suffer most pain about the fourth and the eighth
months, and if the foetus perishes in the fourth or in the
eighth month the mother also succumbs as a general rule;
so that not only do the eight-months’ children not live, but
when they die their mothers are in great danger of their
own lives. In like manner children that are apparently
20 born at a later term than eleven months3 are held to be in
doubtful case; inasmuch as with them also the beginning
of conception may have escaped the notice of the mother.
What I mean to say is that often the womb gets filled
with wind, and then when at a later period connexion and
conception take place, they think that the former circum¬
stance was the beginning of conception from the similarity
25 of the symptoms that they experienced.4
Such then are the differences between mankind and
other animals in regard to the many various modes5 of
completion of the term of pregnancy.0 Furthermore, some
animals produce one and some produce many at a birth,
but the human species does sometimes the one and some¬
times the other. As a general rule and among most
30 nations the women bear one child at a birth ; but frequently
and in many lands they bear twins, as for instance in Egypt
especially.7 Sometimes women bring forth three and even

four children, and especially in certain parts of the world,
as has already been stated. The largest number ever
brought forth is five, and such an occurrence has been
witnessed on several occasions. There was once upon
a time a certain woman who had twenty children at 35
four births; each time she had five, and most of them
grew up.
Now among other animals, if a pair of twins happen to be
male and female they have as good a chance of surviving
as though both had been males or both females;1 but
among mankind very few twins survive if one happen to be 585**
a boy and the other a girl.
Of all animals the woman and the mare are most
inclined to receive the commerce of the male during preg¬
nancy; while all other animals when they are pregnant
avoid the male, save those in which the phenomenon of
superfoetation occurs, such as the hare.2 Unlike that 5
animal, the mare after once conceiving cannot be rendered
pregnant again, but brings forth one foal only, at least as
a general rule ; in the human species cases of superfoetation
are rare, but they do happen now and then.
An embryo conceived some considerable time after a pre¬
vious conception does not come to perfection, but gives
rise to pain and causes the destruction of the earlier
embryo; and, by the way, a case has been known to occur 10
where owing to this destructive influence no less than
twelve embryos conceived by superfoetation have been
discharged.3 But if the second conception take place at
a short interval, then the mother bears that which was
later conceived, and brings forth the two children like
actual twins, as happened, according to the legend, in the
case of Iphicles and Hercules.4 The following also is
a striking example : a certain woman, having committed 15

Cf. Plin. vii. 9.

adultery, brought forth the one child resembling her husband
and the other resembling the adulterous lover.
The case has also occurred where a woman, being
pregnant of twins, has subsequently conceived a third
child ; and in course of time she brought forth the twins
perfect and at full term, but the third a five-months’ child ;
and this last died there and then. And in another case it
happened that the woman was first delivered of a seven
20 months’ child, and then of two which were of full term ;
and of these the first died and the other two survived.
Some also have been known -to conceive while about to
miscarry, and they have lost the one child and been
delivered of the other.
If women while going with child cohabit after the eighth
month the child is in most cases born covered over with
25 a slimy fluid. Often also the child is found to be replete
with food of which the mother had partaken.
When women have partaken of salt in over-abundance
their children are apt to be born destitute of nails.1
Milk that is produced earlier than the seventh month 5
30 is unfit for use;- but as soon as the child is fit to live
the milk is fit to use. The first of the milk is saltish,
as it is likewise with sheep. Most women are sensibly
affected by wine during pregnancy ; for if they partake of
it they grow relaxed and debilitated.
The beginning of child-bearing in women and of the
capacity to procreate in men, and the cessation of these
35 functions in both cases, coincide in the one case with the
emission of seed and in the other with the discharge of
the catamenia : with this qualification that there is a lack
of fertility at the commencement of these symptoms, and
again towards their close when the emissions become scanty
585b and weak. The age at which the sexual powers begin
has been related already.3 As for their end, the menstrual
discharge ceases in most women about their fortieth year;
but with those in whom it goes on longer it lasts even to

 BOOK VII. 5 585b
the fiftieth year, and women of that age have been known
to bear children. But beyond that age there is no case 5
on record.
Men in most cases continue to be sexually competent
until they are sixty years old, and if that limit be over¬
passed then until seventy years; and men have been
actually known to procreate children at seventy years of
age. With many men and many women it so happens
that they are unable to produce children to one another, IO
while they are able to do so in union with other indi¬
viduals.1 The same thing happens with regard to the produc¬
tion of male and female offspring; for sometimes men and
women in union with one another produce male children
or female, as the case may be, but children of the opposite
sex when otherwise mated. And they are apt to change
in this respect with advancing age: for sometimes a hus¬
band and wife while they are young produce female
children and in later life male children ; and in other cases 15
the very contrary occurs. And just the same thing is
true in regard to the generative faculty: for some while
young are childless, but have children when they grow
older; and some have children to begin with, and later on
no more.
There are certain women who conceive with difficulty,
but if they do conceive, bring the child to maturity; 20
while others again conceive readily, but are unable to
bring the child to birth. Furthermore, some men and
some women produce female offspring and some male, as
for instance in the story of Hercules, who among all his
two and seventy children is said to have begotten but one
girl.2 Those women who are unable to conceive, save with
the help of medical treatment or some other adventitious 25
circumstance, are as a general rule apt to bear female
children rather than male.
It is a common thing with men to be at first sexually

competent and afterwards impotent, and then again to
revert to their former powers.
From deformed parents come deformed children, lame
30 from lame and blind from blind,1 and, speaking generally,
children often inherit anything that is peculiar in their
parents and are born with similar marks, such as pimples
or scars. Such things have been known to be handed
down through three generations;2 * for instance, a certain
man had a mark on his arm which his son did not possess,
but his grandson had it in the same spot though not very
distinct.'5
35 Such cases, however, are few ; for the children of cripples
are mostly sound, and there is no hard and fast rule regarding
them. While children mostly resemble their parents or
. 586a their ancestors, it sometimes happens that no such resem¬
blance is to be traced. But parents may pass on resem¬
blance after several generations, as in the case of the
woman in Elis,4 who committed adultery with a negro; in
this case it was not the woman’s own daughter but the
daughter’s child that was a blackamoor.
As a rule the daughters have a tendency to take after
5 the mother, and the boys after the father; but sometimes
it is the other way, the boys taking after the mother and
the girls after the father. And they may resemble both
parents in particular features.5
There have been known cases of twins that had no
resemblance to one another, but they are alike as a general
rule. There was once upon a time a woman who had
10 intercourse with her husband a week after giving birth to
a child, and she conceived and bore a second child as like
the first as any twin. Some women have a tendency to
produce children that take after themselves, and others
children that take after the husband ;0 and this latter case

is like that of the celebrated mare in Pharsalus, that got
the name of the Honest Wife.
7 In the emission of sperm there is a preliminary discharge 15
of air,1 and the outflow is manifestly caused by a blast of
air; for nothing is cast to a distance save by pneumatic
pressure. After the seed reaches the womb and remains
there for a while, a membrane forms around it; for when it
happens to escape before it is distinctly formed, it looks
like an egg enveloped in its membrane after removal of the 20
eggshell; and the membrane is full of veins.
All animals whatsoever, whether they fly or swim or
walk upon dry land, whether they bring forth their young
alive or in the egg, develop in the same way: save only
that some have the navel attached to the womb, namely the
viviparous animals, and some have it attached to the egg, and
some to both parts alike, as in a certain sort of fishes. And
in some cases membranous envelopes surround the egg, and 25
in other cases the chorion surrounds it. And first of all the
animal develops within the innermost envelope, and then
another membrane appears around the former one, which
latter is for the most part attached to the womb, but is in
part separated from it and contains fluid. In between is
a watery or sanguineous fluid, which the women folk call
the forewaters.2 30
8 All animals, or all such as have a navel, grow by the navel.3
And the navel is attached to the cotyledon in all such as
possess cotyledons, and to the womb itself by a vein in all
such as have the womb smooth.4 And as regards their
shape within the womb, the four-footed animals all lie
stretched out, and the footless animals lie on their sides, as
for instance fishes; but two-legged animals lie in a bent 586b
position, as for instance birds;5 and human embryos lie
bent, with nose between the knees and eyes upon the
knees, and the ears free at the sides.

 HISTORIA ANIMALIUM
All animals alike have the head upwards to begin with ;
but as they grow and approach the term of egress from the
womb they turn downwards, and birth in the natural course
of things takes place in all animals head foremost;1 but in
abnormal cases it may take place in a bent position, or feet
foremost.
The young of quadrupeds when they are near their full
time contain excrements, both liquid and in the form of
solid lumps, the latter in the lower part of the bowel and
the urine in the bladder.
In those animals that have cotyledons in the womb the
cotyledons grow less as the embryo grows bigger,2 and at
length they disappear altogether. The navel-string is
a sheath wrapped about blood-vessels which have their
origin in the womb, from the cotyledons in those animals
which possess them and from a blood-vessel in those which
do not. In the larger animals, such as the embryos of
oxen, the vessels are four in number, and in smaller
animals two ; in the very little ones, such as fowls, one
vessel only.3
Of the four vessels that run into the embryo, two pass
through the liver where the so-called gates or ‘portae’4
are, running in the direction of the great vein, and the
other two run in the direction of the aorta towards the
point where it divides and becomes two vessels instead of
one. Around each pair of blood-vessels are membranes,
and surrounding these membranes is the navel-string itself,
after the manner of a sheath.5 And as the embryo grows,
the veins themselves tend more and more to dwindle in
size. And also as the embryo matures it comes down into
the hollow of the womb and is observed to move here, and
sometimes rolls over in the vicinity of the groin.
When women are in labour, their pains determine to- 9
wards many divers parts of the body, and in most cases

to one or other of the thighs. Those are the quickest to
be delivered who experience severe pains in the region of 30
the belly; and parturition is difficult in those who begin
by suffering pain in the loins, and speedy when the pain
is abdominal. If the child about to be born be a male,
the preliminary flood is watery and pale in colour, but
if a girl it is tinged with blood, though still watery. In
some cases of labour these latter phenomena do not occur,
either one way or the other.
In other animals parturition is unaccompanied by pain,
and the dam is plainly seen to suffer but moderate incon- 587a
venience. In women, however, the pains are more severe,
and this is especially the case in persons of sedentary habits,
and in those who are weak-chested and short of breath.
Labour is apt to be especially difficult if during the process
the woman while exerting force with her breath fails to hold
it in.1 5
First of all, when the embryo starts to move 2 and the
membranes burst, there issues forth the watery flood ;3
then afterwards comes the embryo, while the womb everts
and the afterbirth comes out from within.
The cutting of the navel-string, which is the nurse’s duty,
is a matter calling for no little care and skill. For not only
in cases of difficult labour must she be able to render assist- 10
ance with skilful hand, but she must also have her wits
about her in all contingencies, and especially in the opera¬
tion of tying the cord. For if the afterbirth have come
away, the navel is ligatured off from the afterbirth with a
woollen thread and is then cut above the ligature; and at
the place where it has been tied it heals up, and the remain- 15
ing portion drops off. (If the ligature come loose the child
dies from loss of blood.)4 But if the afterbirth has not yet
come away, but remains after the child itself is extruded, it
is cut away within 5 after the ligaturing of the cord.6

It often happens that the child appears to have been
born dead when it is merely weak, and when, before the
20 umbilical cord has been ligatured, the blood has run out into
the cord and its surroundings. But experienced midwives
have been known to squeeze back the blood into the child’s
body from the cord, and immediately the child that a
moment before was bloodless came back to life again.
It is the natural rule, as we have mentioned above, for
2 5 all animals to come into the world head foremost, and
children, moreover, have their hands stretched out by their
sides. And the child gives a cry and puts its hands up to its
mouth as soon as it issues forth.
Moreover the child voids excrement sometimes at once,
sometimes a little later, but in all cases during the first day ;
and this excrement is unduly copious in comparison with
30 the size of the child; it is what the midwives call the
meconium or ‘poppy-juice’. In colour it resembles blood,
extremely dark and pitch-like, but later on it becomes
milky, for the child takes at once to the breast. Before
birth the child makes no sound, even though in difficult
labour it put forth its head while the rest of the body
remains within.
587b In cases where flooding takes place rather before its
time, it is apt to be followed by difficult parturition. But if
discharge take place after birth in small quantity, and in
cases where it only takes place at the beginning and does
not continue till the fortieth day, then in such cases
women make a better recovery and are the sooner ready
5 to conceive again.
Until the child is forty days old it neither laughs nor
weeps during waking hours, but of nights it sometimes does
both ;1 and for the most part it does not even notice being

tickled, but passes most of its time in sleep. As it keeps
on growing it gets more and more wakeful; and moreover
it shows signs of dreaming, though it is long afterwards to
before it remembers what it dreams.
In other animals there is no contrasting difference
between one bone and another, but all are properly
formed; but in children the front part of the head1 is soft
and late of ossifying. And by the way, some animals are
born with teeth, but children begin to cut their teeth in the
seventh month ;2 and the front teeth are the first to come 15
through, sometimes the upper and sometimes the lower
ones. And the warmer the nurses’ milk so much the quicker
are the children’s teeth to come.
11 After parturition and the cleansing flood the milk comes
in plenty, and in some women it flows not only from the 20
nipples but at divers parts of the breasts, and in some cases
even from the armpits. And for some time afterwards there
continue to be certain indurated parts of the breast called
strangalides, or ‘ knots which occur when it so happens
that the moisture is not concocted,3 or when it finds no outlet
but accumulates within.4 For the whole breast is so spongy
that if a woman in drinking happen to swallow a hair, she 25
gets a pain in her breast, which ailment is called ‘ trichia ’ ;5
and the pain lasts till the hair either find its own way out
or be sucked out with the milk.0 Women continue to have
milk until their next conception ; and then the milk stops
coming and goes dry, alike in the human species and in the

30 quadrupedal vivipara. So long as there is a flow of milk
the menstrual purgations do not take place, at least as a
general rule, though the discharge has been known to occur
during the period of suckling. For, speaking generally, a
determination of moisture does not take place at one and
the same time in several directions; as for instance the
menstrual purgations tend to be scanty in persons suffering
from haemorrhoids.1 And in some women the like happens
owing to their suffering from varices,2 when the fluids issue
from the pelvic region before entering into the womb. And
5S8a patients who during suppression of the menses happen to
vomit blood are no whit the worse.3
Children are very commonly subject to convulsions,4 more 12
especially such of them as are more than ordinarily well
nourished on rich orunusually plentiful milk from a stout
5 nurse. Wine is bad for infants, in that it tends to excite
this malady, and red wine is worse than white, especially
when taken undiluted ;5 and most things that tend to induce
flatulency6 are also bad, and constipation too is prejudicial.
The majority of deaths in infancy occur before the child is
a week old, hence it is customary to name the child at that
age,7 from a belief that it has now a better chance of
10 survival. This malady is worst at the full of the moon ;8
and by the way, it is a dangerous symptom when the
spasms begin in the child’s back.9

 BOOK VIII
We have now discussed the physical characteristics of 588
animals and their methods of generation. Their habits
and their modes of living vary according to their character
and their food.
1 In the great majority of animals there are traces of
psychical qualities or attitudes,2 which qualities are
more markedly differentiated in the case of human beings. 20
For just as we pointed out resemblances in the physical
organs,3 so in a number of animals we observe gentleness or
fierceness, mildness or cross temper, courage or timidity, fear
or confidence, high spirit or low cunning, and, with regard
to intelligence, something equivalent to sagacity. Some of
1 Here A. deals with <rwexeLa, the ‘ principle of continuity ’, funda¬ mental in Biology and Psychology. Various analyses of the soul are dialectically possible (cf. Eth. Nic. 1. 13. 1 io2a 28, &c.), but the scientific account is found in the de Anima. There we arrive at a tripartite division (cf. de An. ii. 3. 4i4a 12) into SpemiKov, alcrdijTiKoi^ biavopriKov, in accord with the ascending series of plant (de An. ii. 3. 414s1 33; G.

25 these qualities in man, as compared with the corresponding
qualities in animals, differ only quantitatively: that is to
say, a man has more or less of this quality, and an animal
has more or less of some other; other qualities in man
are represented by analogous and not identical qualities:
for instance, just as in man we find knowledge, wisdom,
30 and sagacity,1 so in certain animals there exists some
other natural potentiality akin to these.2 The truth of
this statement will be the more clearly apprehended if we
have regard to the phenomena of childhood : for in children
may be observed the traces and-seeds of what will one day
588b be settled psychological habits, though psychologically a
child hardly differs for the time being from an animal; so
that one is quite justified in saying that, as regards man
and animals, certain psychical qualities are identical with
one another, whilst others resemble, and others are analogous
to, each other.
Nature proceeds little by little from things lifeless to
5 animal life in such a way that it is impossible to determine
the exact line of demarcation, nor on which side thereof an
intermediate form should lie.3 Thus, next after lifeless
things in the upward scale comes the plant, and of plants
one will differ from another as to its amount of apparent
vitality; and, in a word, the whole genus of plants, whilst
it is devoid of life as compared with an animal, is endowed
10 with life as compared with other corporeal entities.4 5
Indeed, as we just remarked, there is observed in plants
a continuous scale of ascent towards the animal.’ So, in
the sea, there are certain objects concerning which one
would be at a loss to determine whether they be animai
or vegetable.6 For instance, certain of these objects are

fairly rooted,1 and in several cases perish if detached ;
thus the pinna2 is rooted to a particular spot, and the
solen (or razor-shell) cannot survive withdrawal from its
burrow.3 Indeed, broadly speaking, the entire genus of
testaceans have a resemblance to vegetables, if they be
contrasted with such animals as are capable of progression.
In regard to sensibility, some animals give no indication
whatsoever of it, whilst others indicate it but indistinctly.
Further, the substance of some of these intermediate
creatures is fleshlike, as is the case with the so-called
tethya (or ascidians) and the acalephae (or sea-anemones);
but the sponge is in every respect like a vegetable. And
so throughout the entire animal scale there is a graduated
differentiation in amount of vitality and in capacity for
motion.
A similar statement holds good with regard to habits of
life. Thus of plants that spring from seed the one function
seems to be the reproduction of their own particular species, 2
and the sphere of action with certain animals is similarly
limited. The faculty of reproduction, then, is common to
all alike.4 If sensibility be superadded,5 * * * then their lives
will differ from one another in respect to sexual inter¬
course through the varying amount of pleasure derived
therefrom, and also in regard to modes of parturition and
ways of rearing their young. Some animals, like plants,
simply procreate their own species at definite seasons;
other animals busy themselves also in procuring food for
their young, and after they are reared quit them and have
no further dealings with them ; other animals are more in¬
telligent and endowed with memory, and they live with their
offspring for a longer period and on a more social footing.

The life of animals, then, may be divided into two acts
procreation and feeding; for on these two acts all their
5 interests and life concentrate. Their food depends chiefly
on the substance of which they are severally constituted ;
for the source of their growth in all cases will be this
substance. And whatsoever is in conformity with nature
is pleasant, and all animals pursue pleasure in keeping with
their nature.
io Animals are also differentiated locally: that is to say,
some live upon dry land, while others live in the water. And
this differentiation may be interpreted in two1 different
ways. Thus, some animals are termed terrestrial as in¬
haling air, and others aquatic as taking in water ; and there
15 are others which do not actually take in these elements,2
but nevertheless are constitutionally adapted to the
cooling influence, so far as is needful to them, of one
element or the other, and hence are called terrestrial
or aquatic though they neither breathe air nor take in
water. Again,3 other animals are so called from their
finding their food and fixing their habitat on land or in
water: for many animals, although they inhale air and
breed on land, yet derive their food from the water, and
20 live in water for the greater part of their lives; and these
1 MSS., Bekk., Picc.; rpt^aiy, Scalig. after Gaza, A. and \V., Dittm.; cf. 590s 13. I retain di\thinking that A. started with two main dichotomies, one founded on respiration, the other upon habita¬ tion and diet. The first and fundamental distinction is, among blooded animals, between those possessed of a lung and those possessed of gills, those namely which take in air or water for respiration, or (as A. understood it) for Karuyf/i £ir, the cooling of the blood {dc Res/). 10. 473'’ 18). Here a cognate but subsidiary distinction emerges, because bloodless animals can perform this function in a way sufficient for their needs (l/cavcos) through the cooling influence of the surrounding medium and without ‘taking in’ either water or air (cf. de Resp.q. 474lj 26 ; 10. 475b 5, 15; 12. 476^). The second great distinction is that some animals live and feed on land, and some in water; and this is manifestly quite a different dichotomy to the first. A. is hampered throughout this discussion by his habitual reluctance to coin a new nomenclature or to abandon a popular classification embodied in current speech ; he clings to the terms n^ov and twbpov after they are shown to be unfit to connote the sought-for distinctions. * For oil h(\op.(va Picc. cj. ol\ opoid. 3 Read to di tu> with Schn., A. and W., and Dittm.

are the only animals to which as living in and on two
elements the term £ amphibious ’ is applicable. There is
no animal taking in water that is terrestrial or aerial or
that derives its food from the land, whereas of the great
number of land animals inhaling air many get their food
from the water ; moreover some are so peculiarly organized
that if they be shut off altogether from the water they 25
cannot possibly live, as for instance, the so-called sea
turtle, the crocodile, the hippopotamus, the seal, and some
of the smaller creatures, such as the fresh-water tortoise
and the frog: now all these animals choke or drown if
they do not from time to time breathe atmospheric air:
they breed and rear their young on dry land, or near the 30
land,1 but they pass their lives in water.
But the dolphin2 is equipped in the most remarkable
way of all animals: the dolphin and other similar aquatic
animals, including the other cetaceans which resemble it;:j
that is to say, the whale, and all the other creatures that 58gb
are furnished with a blow-hole. One can hardly allow that
such an animal is terrestrial and terrestrial only, or aquatic
and aquatic only, if by terrestrial we mean an animal that
inhales air, and if by aquatic we mean an animal that
takes in water. For the fact is the dolphin performs both
these processes: he takes in water and discharges it by his 5 .
blow-hole, and he also inhales air into his lungs;4 for, by
the way, the creature is furnished with this organ and
respires thereby, and accordingly, when caught in the nets,
he is quickly suffocated for lack of air. He can also live
for a considerable while out of the water, but all this while
he keeps up a dull moaning sound corresponding to the
noise made by air-breathing animals in general;5 further- 10
more, when sleeping, the animal keeps his nose above
water, and he does so that he may breathe the air. Now

 HISTORIA ANIMALIUM
it would be unreasonable to assign one and the same
class of animals to both categories, terrestrial and aquatic,
seeing that these categories are more or less exclusive
of one another; we must accordingly supplement our
definition of the term ‘aquatic’ or ‘marine’. For the
fact is, some aquatic animals take in water and discharge
it again, for the same reason that leads air-breathing animals
15 to inhale air: in other words, with the object of cooling
the blood. Others take in water as incidental to their
mode of feeding; for as they get their food in the water
they cannot but take in water along with their food, and if
they take in water they must be provided with some organ
for discharging it.1 Those blooded animals, then, that use
water for a purpose analogous to respiration are provided
with gills; and such as take in water when catching their
20 prey, with the blow-hole. Similar remarks are applicable
to molluscs and crustaceans ; for again it is by way of
procuring food that these creatures take in water.
Aquatic in different ways, the differences depending
on bodily relation to external temperature and on habit
of life, are such animals on the one hand as take in air
25 but live in water, and such on the other hand as take in
water 2 and are furnished with gills but go upon dry land
and get their living there.3 At present only one animal
of the latter kind is known, the so-called cordylus or
water-newt; this creature is furnished not with lungs but
with gills, but for all that it is a quadruped and fitted for
walking on dry land.4
In the case of all these animals their nature appears in
30 some kind of a way to have got warped, just as some male
animals get to resemble the female, and some female
animals the male.5 The fact is that animals, if they be

 BOOK VIII. 2
subjected to a modification in minute organs, are liable to
immense modifications in their general configuration. This
phenomenon may be observed in the case of gelded
animals : only a minute organ of the animal is mutilated, 59°a
and the creature passes from the male to the female form.
We may infer, then, that if in the primary conformation of
the embryo an infinitesimally minute but absolutely essential
organ sustain a change of magnitude one way or the other,
the animal will in one case turn to male and in the other to
female; and also that, if the said organ be obliterated
altogether, the animal will be of neither one sex nor the
other. And so by the occurrence of modification in minute
organs it comes to pass that one animal is terrestrial and 5
another aquatic, in both senses of these terms.1 2 And,
again, some animals are amphibious whilst other animals
are not amphibious, owing to the circumstance that in
their conformation while in the embryonic condition there
got intermixed into them some portion of the matter of
which their subsequent food is constituted; for, as was
said above/ what is in conformity with nature is to every 10
single animal pleasant and agreeable.
Animals then have been categorized into terrestrial and
aquatic in three ways, according to their assumption of
air or of water, the temperament of their bodies,3 or the
character of their food ; and the mode of life of an animal 15
corresponds to the category in which it is found. That is
to say, in some cases the animal depends for its terrestrial
or aquatic nature on temperament and diet combined, as
well as upon its method of respiration ; and sometimes on
temperament and habits alone.

Of testaceans,1 some, that are incapable of motion, subsist
on fresh water, for, as the sea water dissolves into its
20 constituents, the fresh water from its greater thinness
percolates through the grosser parts;2 in fact, they live on
fresh water just as they were originally engendered from
the same. Now that fresh water is contained in the sea
and can be strained off from it can be proved in a
thoroughly practical way. Take a thin vessel of moulded
25 wax, attach a cord to it, and let it down quite empty into
the sea: in twenty-four hours it will be found to contain
a quantity of water, and the -water will be fresh and
drinkable.3
Sea-anemones feed on such small fishes as come in their
way. The mouth of this creature is in the middle of its
body ; and this fact may be clearly observed in the case
30 of the larger varieties. Like the oyster it has a duct for
the outlet of the residuum; and this duct is at the top
of the animal.4 In other words, the sea-anemone cor¬
responds to the inner fleshy part of the oyster, and the
stone to which the one creature clings corresponds to
the shell which encases the other.
The limpet detaches itself from the rock and goes about
in quest of food. Of shell-fish that are mobile, some are
59°b carnivorous and live on little fishes, as for instance, the
1 roiv fiev daTpaicodepnan' kt\. The long discursive account which follows of the diet of animals seems to hark back to the end of Chap. I, the essay on aquatic and terrestrial life reading like a parenthetic interpolation. 2 Cf. H.A. v. 16. 548* 27; P.A. iv. 7. 683b 29. Aelian, ix. 64, attributes the doctrine to Democritus. Theophr. C. PI. ii. 5. 2 describes a strain¬ ing or selective absorption of sea water by the roots of trees. As to dia rcov nvuvcov cf.

purple murex—and there can be no doubt that the purple
murex is carnivorous, as it is caught by a bait of fish;
others are carnivorous, but feed also on marine vegetation.
The sea-turtles feed on shell-fish—for, by the way, their
mouths are extraordinarily hard ; (whatever object it seizes, 5
stone or other, it crunches into bits, but when it leaves the
water for dry land it browses on grass).1 These creatures
suffer greatly, and oftentimes die when they lie on the
surface of the water exposed to a scorching sun ; for, when
once they have risen to the surface, they find a difficulty
in sinking again.
Crustaceans feed in like manner. They are omnivorous ; 10
that is to say, they live on stones, slime, sea-weed, and
excrement—as for instance the rock-crab—and are also
carnivorous. The crawfish or spiny-lobster can get the
better of fishes even of the larger species, though in some
of them it occasionally finds more than its match. Thus,
this animal is so overmastered and cowed by the octopus
that it dies of terror if it become aware of an octopus 15
in the same net with itself.2 The crawfish can master the
conger-eel,3 for owing to the rough spines of the crawfish
the eel cannot slip away and elude its hold. The conger
eel, however, devours the octopus, for owing to the slip¬
periness of its antagonist the octopus can make nothing
of it. The crawfish feeds on little fish, capturing them 20
beside its hole or dwelling-place; for, by the way, it is
found out at sea on rough and stony bottoms, and in such
places it makes its den. Whatever it catches, it puts into
its mouth with its pincer-like claws,4 like the common 25
crab. Its nature is to walk straight forward when it has

nothing to fear, with its feelers hanging sideways; if it be
frightened, it makes its escape backwards, darting off to
a great distance. These animals fight one another with
their claws, just as rams fight with their horns, raising
them and striking their opponents ;1 they are often also
30 seen crowded together in herds. So much for the mode of
life of the crustacean.
Molluscs2 are all carnivorous; and of molluscs the
calamary and the sepia are more than a match for fishes
5gia even of the large species. The octopus for the most part
gathers shell-fish, extracts the flesh, and feeds on that;
in fact, fishermen recognize their holes by the number of
shells lying about." Some say that the octopus devours
its own species,4 but this statement is incorrect; it is
doubtless founded on the fact that the creature is often
5 found with its tentacles removed, which tentacles have
really been eaten off by the conger.'
Fishes, all without exception, feed on spawn in the
spawning season ; but in other respects the food varies
with the varying species. Some fishes are exclusively
carnivorous, as the cartilaginous genus, the conger, the
10 channa or Serratius, the tunny, the bass, the synodon or
Dentex, the amia, the sea-perch, and the muraena. The
red mullet is carnivorous, but feeds also on sea-weed, on
shell-fish, and on mud. The grey mullet feeds on mud,
the dascyllus0 on mud and offal, the scarus or parrot-fish
15 and the melanurus" on sea-weed, the saupe on offal and
sea-weed ;8 the saupe feeds also on zostera,9 and is the

only fish that is captured with a gourd.1 All fishes devour
their own species, with the single exception of the cestreus
or mullet; and the conger is especially ravenous in this
respect. The cephalus 2 and the mullet in general are the
only fish that eat no flesh;1 this may be inferred from
the facts that when caught they are never found with flesh 20
in their intestines, and that the bait used to catch them
is not flesh but barley-cake.4 Every fish of the mullet
kind lives on sea-weed and sand. The cephalus, called by
some the ‘ chelon keeps near in to the shore, the peraeas5
keeps out at a distance from it, and feeds on a mucous
substance exuding from itself, and consequently is always
in a starved condition.6 The cephalus lives in mud, and is 25
in consequence heavy and slimy; it never feeds on any
other fish. As it lives in mud, it has every now and then
former means horehound(Marruh/um),and is accordingly inadmissible ; npacrov, besides its usual signification of garlic (Allium), means also a marine plant, probably our Zosfera: cf. Theophr. H.

This might well mean ‘ with the bait of a gherkin’; but Apostolides (p. 46) describes a peculiar mode of fishing for 6p<p6s, Epinephilus gigas, by means of a gourd (KoXoKvvdrj). This fish, on being hooked, retreats into its hole and holds on by dilating its spiny gill-covers; accordingly the practice is to attach the line in a peculiar way to a floating gourd, and to haul in the exhausted fish a couple of days later. Curiously enough, Ap. states that the saupe (Box salpe), which is a worthless fish (Ovid, Hal. 122 ; Plin. ix. 32), is generally used to bait the line. I think it very possible that the present passage is faulty, and that 77 6p<fios has dropped out. 2 All the fishes next described, <icf)a\o?, Kearpevs, and ^eXcOr, appear to be mullets or fish closely allied thereto. Cievolo and chelone are mod. Ital. for Mugil cephalus and chelo. 3 Cf. Athen. vii. 307 ; Plut. Sol.

to make a leap upwards out of the mud so as to wash the
slime from off its body. There is no creature known to
prey upon the spawn of the cephalus, so that the species
is exceedingly numerous; when, however, the fish is full
30 grown it is preyed upon by a number of fishes, and
59ib especially by the acharnas1 or bass. Of all fishes the
mullet2 * is the most voracious and insatiable, and in con¬
sequence its belly is kept at full stretch ; whenever it is not
starving, it may be considered as out of condition. When
it is frightened, it hides its head in mud, under the notion
that it is hiding its whole body.0' The synodon is car
5 nivorous and feeds on molluscs. Very often the synodon
and the channa cast up their stomachs4 while chasing
smaller fishes ; for, be it remembered, fishes have their
stomachs close to the mouth, and are not furnished with
a gullet.5 6
Some fishes then, as has been stated, are carnivorous,
and carnivorous only, as the dolphin, the synodon, the gilt
10 head, the selachians, and the molluscs/’ Other fishes feed
habitually on mud or sea-weed or sea-moss or the so-called
stalk-weed or growing plants; as for instance, the phycis,
the goby, and the rock-fish; and, by the way, the only
meat that the phycis will touch is that of prawns. Very
13 often, however, as has been stated, they devour one another,
and especially do the larger ones devour the smaller. The
proof of their being carnivorous is the fact that they can
be caught with flesh for a bait. The mackerel, the tunny,
and the bass are for the most part carnivorous, but they do
occasionally feed on sea-weed. The sargue feeds on the
leavings of the trigle or red mullet. The red mullet bur

rows in the mud, and when it sets the mud in motion and 20
quits its haunt, the sargue settles down into the place
and feeds on what is left behind, and prevents any smaller
fish from settling in the immediate vicinity.1
Of all fishes the so-called scarus, or parrot-wrasse, is the
only one known to chew the cud like a quadruped.2
As a general rule the larger fishes catch the smaller ones
in their mouths whilst swimming straight after them in the
ordinary position ; but the selachians,3 the dolphin, and 25
all the cetacea4 must first turn over on their backs, as
their mouths are placed down below; this allows a fair
chance of escape to the smaller fishes, and, indeed, if it
were not so, there would be very few of the little fishes
left, for the speed and voracity of the dolphin is something
marvellous.5
Of eels G a few here and there feed on mud and on chance
morsels of food thrown to them ; the greater part of them 592
subsist on fresh water. Eel-breeders are particularly careful
to have the water kept perfectly clear, by its perpetually
flowing on to flat slabs of stone 7 and then flowing off again ;
sometimes they coat the eel-tanks with plaster. The fact
is that the eel will soon choke if the water is not clear, 5
as his gills are peculiarly small. On this account, when
fishing for eels, they disturb the water.8 In the river
Strymon eel-fishing takes place at the rising of the Pleiads,
because &t this period the water is troubled and the mud
raised up9 by contrary winds ;10 unless the water be in this
condition, it is as well to leave the eels alone. When dead
the eel, unlike the majority of fishes, neither floats on nor 10
rises to the surface ; and this is owing to the smallness

of the stomach. A few eels are supplied with fat, but the
greater part have no fat whatsoever. When removed from
the water they can live for five or six days ;1 for a longer
period if north winds prevail, for a shorter if south winds.2
15 If they are removed in summer from the pools to the
tanks they will die ; but not so if removed in the winter.
They are not capable of holding out against any abrupt
change ; consequently they often die in large numbers when
men engaged in transporting3 them from one place to
another dip them into water particularly cold. They will
also die of suffocation if they be kept in a scanty supply of
20 water. This same remark will hold good for fishes in
general ; for they are suffocated if they be long confined
in a short supply of water, with the water kept unchanged
just as animals that respire are suffocated if they be shut
up with a scanty supply of air. The eel in some cases
lives for seven or eight years. The river-eel feeds on his
25 own species, on grass, or on roots, or on any chance food
found in the mud.4 Their usual feeding-time is at night,
and during the day-time they retreat into deep water.
And so much for the food of fishes.
Of birds, such as have crooked talons are carnivorous 3
without exception, and cannot swallow corn or bread-food
even if it be put into their bills in tit-bits ; as for instance,
592b the eagle of every variety, the kite, the two species of
hawks, to wit, the dove-hawk and the sparrow-hawk—and,
by the way, these two hawks differ greatly in size from one
another—and the buzzard. The buzzard is of the same
size as the kite, and is visible at all seasons of the year.’’
5 There is also the phene (or lammergeier) and the vulture.
The phene is larger than the common eagle and is ashen
in colour. Of the vulture there are two varieties : one small
and whitish, the other comparatively large and rather more
ashen-coloured than white.0 Further, of birds that fly by

 BOOK VIII. 3 592
night, some have crooked talons, such as the night-raven,
the owl, and the eagle-owl. The eagle-owl resembles the
common owl in shape, but it is quite as large as the eagle. 10
Again, there is the eleus, the Aegolian owl, and the little
horned owl. Of these birds, the eleus is somewhat larger
than the barn-door cock, and the Aegolian owl is of about
the same size as the eleus, and both these birds hunt the
jay ; the little horned owl is smaller than the common owl.
All these three birds are alike in appearance, and all three
are carnivorous.
Again, of birds that have not crooked talons some are 15
carnivorous, such as the swallow. Others feed on grubs,
such as the chaffinch, the sparrow, the ‘ batis ’, the green
linnet, and the titmouse. Of the titmouse there are three
varieties. The largest is the finch-titmouse—for it is about
the size of a finch ; the second has a long tail, and from its
habitat is called the hill-titmouse; the third resembles the 20
other two in appearance, but is less in size than either of
them.1 Then come the becca-fico,2 the black-cap, the bull¬
finch, the robin, the epilais, the midget-bird, and the
golden-crested wren. This wren is little larger than a
locust, has a crest of bright red gold,3 and is in every way
a beautiful and graceful little bird. Then the anthus, a 25
bird about the size of a finch; and the mountain-finch,
which resembles a finch and is of much the same size, but
its neck is blue,4 and it is named from its habitat; and
lastly the wren and the rook. The above-enumerated
birds and the like of them feed either wholly or for the
most part on grubs, but the following and the like feed on
thistles; to wit, the linnet, the thraupis, and the goldfinch.
All these birds feed on thistles, but never on grubs or any 593
living thing whatever ; they live and roost also on the
plants from which they derive their food.
1 To wit, the great tit or ox-eye, the long-tailed or the penduline tit, and lastly the tomtit, coletit, and other allied species. 2 On avKuXis and \aeXayKopv(f)os cf. H.

There arc other birds whose favourite food consists of
insects found beneath the bark of trees ; as for instance,
5 the great and the small pie, which are nicknamed the wood¬
peckers. These two birds resemble one another in plumage
and in note, only that the note of the larger bird is the
louder of the two; they both frequent the trunks of trees
in quest of food. There is also the greenpie, a bird about
the size of a turtle-dove, green-coloured all over, that pecks
at the bark of trees with extraordinary vigour, lives generally
io on the branch of a tree, has a loud note, and is mostly found
in the Peloponnese. There is another bird called the ‘grub
picker ’ (or tree-creeper), about as small as the penduline
titmouse, with speckled plumage of an ashen colour, and
with a poor note ; it is a variety of the woodpecker.1
There are other birds that live on fruit and herbage,
15 such as the wild pigeon or ring-dove, the common pigeon,
the rock-dove, and the turtle-dove. The ring-dove and the
common pigeon are visible at all seasons; the turtle-dove
only in the summer, for in winter it lurks in some hole or
other and is never seen.2 The rock-dove is chiefly visible
in the autumn, and is caught at that season ; it is larger
20 than the common pigeon but smaller than the wild one ;3
it is generally caught while drinking.4 These pigeons bring
their young ones with them when they visit this country.
All our other birds come to us in the early summer and
build their nests here, and the greater part of them rear
their young on animal food,5 with the sole exception of the
pigeon and its varieties.
The whole genus of birds may be pretty well divided
25 into such as procure their food on dry land, such as frequent
rivers and lakes, and such as live on or by the sea.
Of water-birds such as are web-footed live actually on
the water, while such as are split-footed live by the edge of

it—and, by the way, water-birds that are not carnivorous
live on water-plants, (but most of them live on fish),1 like
the heron2 and the spoonbill that frequent the banks of 593
lakes and rivers; and the spoonbill, by the way, is less
than the common heron, and has a long flat bill. There are
furthermore the stork and the seamew; and the seamew,
by the way, is ashen-coloured. There is also the schoenilus,
the cinclus, and the white-rump. Of these smaller birds 5
the last mentioned is the largest, being about the size of
the common thrush ; all three may be described as ‘ wag¬
tails ’. Then there is the scalidris, with plumage ashen
grey, but speckled. Moreover, the family of the halcyons
or kingfishers live by the waterside. Of kingfishers there
are two varieties;3 one that sits on reeds and sings; the 10
other, the larger of the two, is without a note. Both these
varieties are blue on the back. There is also the trochilus
(or sandpiper). The halcyon also, including a variety'
termed the cerylus, is found near the seaside. The crow
also feeds on such animal life as is cast up on the beach,
for the bird is omnivorous. There are also the white gull,
the cepphus, the aethyia, and the charadrius. 15
Of web-footed birds, the larger species live on the banks
of rivers and lakes; as the swan, the duck, the coot, the
grebe, and the teal—a bird resembling the duck but less in
size—and the water-raven or cormorant. This bird is the
size of a stork, only that its legs are shorter; it is web¬
footed and is a good swimmer ; its plumage is black. It 20
roosts on trees,4 and is the only one of all such birds as
these that is found to build its nest in a tree. Further there
is the large goose, the little gregarious goose, the vulpanser,
the horned grebe,5 and the penelops. The sea-eagle lives
in the neighbourhood of the sea and seeks its quarry in
lagoons.
A great number of birds are omnivorous. Birds of prey 25
feed on any animal or bird, other than a bird of prey, that
they may catch. These birds never touch one of their own

genus, whereas fishes often devour members actually of
their own species.
Birds, as a rule, are very spare drinkers. In fact birds
594d of prey never drink at all, excepting a very few, and these
drink very rarely; and this last observation is peculiarly
applicable to the kestrel.1 The kite has been seen to drink,
but he certainly drinks very seldom.
Animals that are coated with tessellates— such as the 4
lizard and the other quadrupeds, and the serpents—are
5 omnivorous: at all events they are carnivorous and
graminivorous; and serpents, by the way, are of all
animals the greatest gluttons.
Tessellated animals are spare drinkers, as are also all
such animals as have a spongy lung,2 and such a lung,
scantily supplied with blood, is found in all oviparous
animals.3 Serpents, by the by, have an insatiate appetite
10 for wine ;4 consequently, at times men hunt for snakes by
pouring wine into saucers and putting them into the inter¬
stices of walls, and the creatures are caught when
inebriated. Serpents are carnivorous, and whenever they
catch an animal they extract all its juices and eject the
creature whole. And, by the way, this is done by all
other creatures of similar habits, as for instance the spider;
only that the spider sucks out the juices of its prey outside,
15 and the serpent does so in its belly. The serpent takes
any food presented to him, eats birds and animals, and
swallows eggs entire.5 But after taking his prey he
stretches himself until he stands straight out to the very
tip,0 and then he contracts and squeezes himself into little
compass, so that the swallowed mass may pass down his
ao outstretched body;7 and this action on his part is due to
the tenuity and length of his gullet. Spiders and snakes

can both' go without food for a long time ; and this remark
may be verified by observation of specimens kept alive in
the shops of the apothecaries.
5 Of viviparous quadrupeds such as are fierce and jag- 25
toothed are without exception carnivorous ; though, by
the way, it is stated of the wolf, but of no other animal,
that in extremity of hunger it will eat a certain kind of
earth.1 These carnivorous animals never eat grass except
wh^n they are sick, just as dogs bring on a vomit by eating
grass and thereby purge themselves.
The solitary wolf is more apt to attack man than the 30
wolf that goes with a pack.2
The animal called ‘ glanus 5 by some and ‘ hyaena 5 by
others is as large as a wolf, with a mane like a horse, 594b
only that the hair is stiffer and longer and extends over
the entire length of the chine. It will lie in wait for a man
and chase him,3 and will inveigle a dog within its reach by
making a noise that resembles the retching noise of a man
vomiting.4 It is exceedingly fond of putrefied flesh, and
will burrow in a graveyard to gratify this propensity.
The bear is omnivorous. It eats fruit, and is enabled by 5
the suppleness of its body to climb a tree; it also eats
vegetables, and it will break up a hive to get at the honey ;
it eats crabs and ants also, and is in a general way car¬
nivorous. It is so powerful that it will attack not only the
deer but the wild boar, if it can take it unawares, and also 10
the bull. After coming to close quarters with the bull it
falls on its back in front of the animal, and, when the bull
proceeds to butt, the bear seizes hold of the bull’s horns
with its front paws, fastens its teeth into his shoulder, and
drags him down to the ground.5 For a short time together 15
it can walk erect on its hind legs. All the flesh it eats it
first allows to become carrion.6

The lion, like all other savage and jag-toothed animals,
is carnivorous. It devours its food greedily and fiercely,
and often swallows its prey entire without rending
it at all; it will then go fasting for two or three days
20 together, being rendered capable of this abstinence by its
previous surfeit.1 It is a spare drinker. It discharges the
solid residuum in small quantities, about every other day or
at irregular intervals, and the substance of it is hard and dry
like the excrement of a dog. The wind discharged from
off its stomach is pungent, and its urine emits a strong
odour, a phenomenon which, in the case of dogs, accounts
25 for their habit of sniffing at trees;2 for, by the way, the lion,
like the dog, lifts its leg to void its urine. It infects the
food it eats with a strong smell by breathing on it,3 and
when the animal is cut open an overpowering vapour
exhales from its inside.
Some wild quadrupeds feed in lakes and rivers ; the seal
30 is the only one that gets its living on the sea. To the
former class of animals belong the so-called castor, the
satyrium,4 the otter, and the so-called latax, or beaver.
The beaver is flatter than the otter and has strong teeth ;
595a it often at night-time emerges from the water and goes
nibbling at the bark of the aspens that fringe the river¬
sides. The otter will bite a man, and it is said that when¬
ever it bites it will never let go until it hears a bone crack.
The hair of the beaver is rough, intermediate in appearance
5 between the hair of the seal and the hair of the deer.
jag-toothed animals drink by lapping, as do also some 6
animals with teeth differently formed, as the mouse. Animals
whose upper and lower teeth meet evenly5 drink by suction,

as the horse and the ox ; the bear neither laps nor sucks,
but gulps down his drink. Birds, as a rule, drink by io
suction, but the long-necked birds stop and elevate their
heads at intervals ; the purple coot is the only one (of the
long-necked birds) that swallows water by gulps.1
Horned animals, domesticated or wild, and all such as
are not jag-toothed, are all frugivorous and graminivorous,
save under great stress of hunger.2 The pig3 is an ex- 15
ception ; it cares little for grass or fruit, but of all animals
it is the fondest of roots, owing to the fact that its snout is
peculiarly adapted for digging them out of the ground ;4
it is also of all animals the most easily pleased in the
matter of food. It takes on fat more rapidly in proportion
to its size than any other animal; in fact, a pig can be 20
fattened for the market in sixty days. Pig-dealers can tell
the amount of flesh taken on, by having first weighed the
animal while it was being starved. Before the fattening pro¬
cess begins, the creature must be starved for three days ;5
and, by the way, animals in general will take on fat if sub¬
jected previously to a course of starvation ; after the three
days of starvation, pig-breeders feed the animal lavishly.
Breeders in Thrace, when fattening pigs, give them a drink on 25
the first day; then they miss one, and then two days, then
three and four, until the interval extends over seven days.
The pigs’ meat used for fattening is composed of barley,
millet, figs, acorns, wild pears, and cucumbers.6 These
animals—and other animals that have warm bellies7—are 3°
fattened by repose. [Pigs also fatten the better by being
allowed to wallow in mud.8 They like to feed in batches
of the same age. A pig will give battle even to a wolf.]9 595 b

If a pig be weighed when living, you may calculate that
after death its flesh will weigh five-sixths of that weight,
and the hair, the blood, and the rest will weigh the other
sixth. When suckling their young, swine—like all other
animals—get attenuated. So much for these animals.
5 Cattle 1 feed on corn and grass, and fatten on vegetables ^
that tend to cause flatulency,2 such as bitter vetch or
bruised beans or bean-stalks. The older ones also will
fatten if they be fed up after an incision has been made
into their hide, and air blown thereinto.3 Cattle will fatten
also on barley in its natural state or on barley finely
io winnowed, or on sweet food, such as figs, or pulp from the
wine-press.4 or on elm-leaves. But nothing is so fattening
as the heat of the sun and wallowing in warm waters. If the
horns of young cattle be smeared with hot wax, you may
mould them to any shape you please,5 and cattle are less
subject to disease of the hoof if you smear the horny parts0
15 with wax, pitch, or olive oil. Herded cattle suffer more when
they are forced to change their pasture-ground by frost than
when snow is the cause of change. Cattle grow all the more
in size when they are kept from sexual commerce over a
number of years; and it is with a view to growth in size
that in Epirus the so-called Pyrrhic kine7 are not allowed
intercourse with the bull until they are nine years8 old;

from which circumstance they are nicknamed the ‘ unbulled ’
kine. Of these Pyrrhic cattle, by the way, they say that
there are only about four hundred in the world, that they 20
are the private property of the Epirote royal family, that
they cannot thrive out of Epirus, and that people elsewhere
have tried to rear them, but without success.
8 Horses, mules, and asses feed on corn and grass, but are
fattened chiefly by drink. Just in proportion as beasts of
burden drink water, so will they more or less enjoy their
food, and a place will give good or bad feeding according 25
as the water is good or bad. Green corn, while ripening,1
will give a smooth coat; but such corn is injurious if the
spikes are too stiff and sharp.2 The first crop of clover
is unwholesome, and so is clover over which ill-scented
water runs; for the clover is sure to get the taint of the
water.3 Cattle like clear water for drinking ;4 but the horse 30
in this respect resembles the camel, for the camel likes
turbid and thick water, and will never drink from a stream
until he has trampled it into a turbid condition.5 And, by gg6
the way, the camel can go without water for as much as
four days, but after that when he drinks, he drinks in
immense quantities.0
9 The elephant7 at the most can eat nine Macedonian
medimni of fodder8 at one meal; but so large an amount is
unwholesome. As a general rule it can take six or seven 5
medimni of fodder, five medimni of wheat, and five mareis
of wine—six cotylae going to the mavis? An elephant
has been known to drink right off fourteen Macedonian
metretae of water, and another eight metretae later in
the day.

Camels1 live for about thirty2 years ; in some ex
io ceptional cases they live much longer, and instances have
been known of their living to the age of a hundred. The
elephant is said by some to live for about two hundred
years ; by others, for three hundred.
Sheep and goats are graminivorous, but sheep browse io
assiduously and steadily, whereas goats shift their ground
rapidly, and browse only on the tips of the herbage.
T5 Sheep are much improved in condition by drinking, and
accordingly they give the flocks salt 3 every five days in
summer, to the extent of one medimnus to the hundred
sheep, and this is found to render a flock healthier
and fatter. In fact they mix salt4 with the greater part
of their food ; a large amount of salt is mixed into their
20 bran (for the reason that they drink more when thirsty),
and in autumn they get cucumbers with a sprinkling of salt
on them ; this admixture of salt in their food tends also
to increase the quantity of milk in the ewes. If sheep
be kept on the move at midday they will drink more
copiously towards evening ; and if the ewes be fed with
salted food as the lambing season draws near they will
get larger udders. Sheep are fattened by twigs of the
25 olive or of the oleaster, by vetch, and bran of every kind;
and these articles of food fatten all the more if they be
first sprinkled with brine. Sheep will take on flesh all the
better if they be first put for three days through a process
of starving. In autumn, water from the north is more
wholesome for sheep than water from the south.5 Pasture
grounds are all the better if they have a westerly aspect.
Sheep will lose flesh if they be kept overmuch on the
30 move or be subjected to any hardship. In winter time

shepherds can easily distinguish the vigorous sheep from
the weakly, from the fact that the vigorous sheep are
covered with hoar-frost while the weakly ones are quite
free of it; the fact being that the weakly ones feeling 596
oppressed with the burden shake themselves and so get
rid of it. The flesh of all quadrupeds deteriorates in
marshy pastures, and is the better on high grounds. Sheep
that have flat tails1 can stand the winter better2 than
long-tailed sheep, and short-fleeced sheep than the shaggy- 5
fleeced;3 and sheep with crisp wool 4 stand the rigour of
winter very poorly. Sheep are healthier than goats, but
goats are stronger than sheep.5 [The fleeces and the wool
of sheep that have been killed by wolves, as also the
clothes made from them, are exceptionally infested with
lice.]6
Of insects, such as have teeth are omnivorous; such as 10
have a tongue feed on liquids only, extracting 7 with that
organ juices from all quarters. And of these latter some
may be called omnivorous, inasmuch as they feed on
every kind of juice, as for instance, the common fly ; others
are blood-suckers, such as the gadfly and the horse-fly,
others again live on the juices of fruits and plants. The
bee is the only insect that invariably eschews whatever is 15
rotten ;8 it will touch no article of food unless it have
a sweet-tasting juice, and it is particularly fond of drinking

water if it be found bubbling up clear from a spring
underground.
So much for the food of animals of the leading genera.
20 The habits of animals are all connected with either 12
breeding and the rearing of young, or with the procuring
a due supply of food ; and these habits are modified so as to
suit cold and heat and the variations of the seasons. For all
animals have an instinctive perception of the changes of tem
25 perature, and, just as men seek shelter in houses in winter, or
as men of great possessions1 spend their summer in cool
places and their winter in sunny ones, so also all animals
that can do so shift their habitat at various seasons.
Some creatures can make provision against change with
30 out stirring from their ordinary haunts; others migrate,
quitting Pontus and the cold countries after the autumnal
597a equinox to avoid the approaching winter, and after the
spring equinox migrating from warm lands to cool lands
to avoid the coming heat. In some cases they migrate
from places near at hand, in others they may be said
to come from the ends of the world, as in the case of the
crane ;2 for these birds migrate from the steppes of Scythia
5 to the marshlands south of Egypt where the Nile has its
source.3 And it is here, by the way, that they are said to
fight with the pygmies;4 and the story is not fabulous,
but there is in reality a race of dwarfish men, and the
horses are little in proportion, and the men live in caves
underground. Pelicans also migrate, and fly from the
10 Strymon to the Ister, and breed on the banks of this river.
They depart in flocks, and the birds in front wait for
those in the rear, owing to the fact that when the flock
is passing over the intervening mountain range, the birds
in the rear lose sight of their companions in the van.
Fishes also in a similar manner shift their habitat now out of

the Euxine1 and now into it. In winter they move from the 15
outer sea in towards land in quest of heat ; in summer they
shift from shallow waters to the deep sea to escape the heat.2
Weakly birds in winter and in frosty weather come down
to the plains for warmth, and in summer migrate to the
hills for coolness. The more weakly an animal is the 20
greater hurry will it be in to migrate on account of extremes
of temperature, either hot or cold; thus the mackerel
migrates in advance of the tunnies, and the quail in
advance of the cranes. The former migrates in the month
of Boedromion, and the latter in the month of Maemacte
rion.3 All creatures are fatter in migrating from cold to 25
heat than in migrating from heat to cold ; thus the quail
is fatter when he emigrates in autumn than when he
arrives in spring. The migration from cold countries is
contemporaneous with the close of the hot season. Animals
are in better trim for breeding purposes in spring-time,4
when they change from hot to cool lands.
Of birds, the crane, as has been said, migrates from one 30
end of the world to the other; they fly against the wind.
The story told about the stone is untrue : to wit, that the 597b
bird, so the story goes, carries in its inside a stone by
way of ballast, and that the stone when vomited up is a
touchstone for gold.5
The cushat and the rock-dove migrate, and never winter
in our country, as is the case also with the turtle-dove6;
the common pigeon, however, stays behind. The quail 5
also migrates; only, by the way, a few quails and turtle¬
doves may stay behind here and there in sunny districts.
Cushats and turtle-doves flock together, both when they
arrive and when the season for migration comes round
again. When quails come to land,7 if it be fair weather or
if a north wind is blowing, they will pair off and manage 10
pretty comfortably; but if a southerly wind prevail they

are greatly distressed owing to the difficulties in the way of
flight,1 for a southerly wind is wet and violent. For this
reason bird-catchers are never on the alert for these birds
during fine weather, but only during the prevalence of
southerly winds,2 when the bird from the violence of the
wind is unable to fly.3 And, by the way, it is owing to
the distress occasioned by the bulkiness of its body that
the bird always screams while flying: for the labour is
15 severe. When the quails come from abroad4 they have
no leaders, but when they migrate hence, the glottis flits
along with them, as does also the landrail, and the eared
owl, and the corncrake.5 The corncrake calls them in the
night, and when the bird-catchers hear the croak of the
bird in the night-time they know that the quails are on
20 the move. The landrail is like a marsh bird, and the
glottis has a tongue that can project far out of its beak.
The eared owl is like an ordinary owl, only that it has
feathers about its ears; by some it is called the night
raven. It is a great rogue of a bird, and is a capital mimic ;
a bird-catcher will dance before it and, while the bird is
mimicking his gestures, the accomplice comes behind and
25 catches it.6 The common owl is caught by a similar trick.
As a general rule all birds with crooked talons are short¬
necked, flat-tongued, and disposed to mimicry. The Indian
bird, the parrot,7 which is said to have a man’s tongue,
answers to this description ; and, by the way, after drinking
wine, the parrot becomes more saucy than ever.
Of birds, the following are migratory—the crane, the
30 swan, the pelican, and the lesser goose.
Of fishes, some, as has been observed, migrate from the
outer seas in towards shore, and from the shore towards
59$a the outer seas, to avoid the extremes of cold and heat.

Fish living near to the shore are better eating than
deep-sea fish. The fact is they have more abundant and
better feeding, for wherever the sun’s heat can reach vege¬
tation is more abundant, better in quality, and more delicate,
as is seen in any ordinary garden. Further, the black 1
shore-weed grows near to shore; the other shore-weed 5
is like wild weed.2 Besides, the parts of the sea near to
shore are subjected to a more equable temperature ; and
consequently the flesh of shallow-water fishes is firm and
consistent, whereas the flesh of deep-water fishes is flaccid
and watery.
The following fishes are found near into shore—the
synodon,3 the black bream,4 the merou,5 * the gilthead, the 1
mullet, the red mullet, the wrasse, the weaver,0 the calli
onymus, the goby,7 and rock-fishes of all kinds. The

fishes, the white conger, the serranus, the erythrinus, and
the glaucus. The braize,8 the sea-scorpion, the black

conger,1 the muraena, and the piper or sea-cuckoo are
15 found alike in shallow and deep waters. These fishes,
however, vary for various localities ; for instance, the goby
and all rock-fish are fat off the coast of Crete. Again, the
tunny is out of season in summer, when it is being preyed
on by its own peculiar louse-parasite,2 but after the rising
of Arcturus, when the parasite has left it, it comes into
20 season again. A number of fish also are found in sea
estuaries ; such as the saupe, the gilthead, the red mullet,
and, in point of fact, the greater part of the gregarious
fishes. The bonito also is found in such waters,3 as, for
instance, off the coast of Alopeconnesus; and most4 species
of fishes are found in Lake Bistonis.5 The coly-mackerelG as
a rule does not enter the Euxine, but passes the summer in
25 the Propontis, where it spawns, and winters in the Aegean.7
The tunny proper, the pelamys, and the bonito penetrate
into the Euxine in summer and pass the summer there;
as do also the greater part of such fish as swim in shoals
with the currents, or congregate in shoals together. And
most fish congregate in shoals, and shoal-fishes in all cases
have leaders.
3° Fish penetrate into the Euxine for two reasons, and firstly
for food. For the feeding is more abundant and better in
quality owing to the amount of fresh river-water that dis¬
charges into the sea,8 and moreover, the large fishes of this
5gSb inland sea are smaller than the large fishes of the outer sea.
In point of fact, there is no large fish in the Euxine except¬
ing the dolphin and the porpoise,9 and the dolphin is a

small variety; but as soon as you get into the outer sea
the big fishes are on the big scale. Furthermore, fish
penetrate into this sea for the purpose of breeding; for
there are recesses there favourable for spawning, and the
fresh and exceptionally sweet water has an invigorating 5
effect upon the spawn. After spawning, when the young
fishes have attained some size, the parent fish swim out
of the Euxine immediately after the rising of the Pleiads.
If winter comes in with a southerly wind, they swim out
with more or less of deliberation ; but, if a north wind be
blowing, they swim out with greater rapidity, from the fact
that the breeze is favourable to their own course. And,
by the way, the young fish are caught about this time
in the neighbourhood of Byzantium very small in size, 10
as might have been expected from the shortness of their
sojourn in the Euxine.1 The shoals in general are visible
both as they quit and enter the Euxine. The trichiae,2
however, only can be caught during their entry, but are
never visible during their exit; in point of fact, when a
trichia is caught running outwards in the neighbourhood
of Byzantium, the fishermen are particularly careful to
cleanse their nets, as the circumstance is so singular and
exceptional. The way of accounting for this phenomenon 15
is that this fish, and this one only, swims northwards into
the Danube, and then at the point of its bifurcation swims
down southwards into the Adriatic.3 And, as a proof that
this theory is correct, the very opposite phenomenon pre¬
sents itself in the Adriatic ; that is to say, they are not
1 At the present day ‘the fishermen maintain that these [autumn] shoals [of young tunnies] are composed of fishes of the same year : the uniformity of size is certainly very striking’ (Ed. Forbes, op. tit., p. 206)]. 2 TpLxia is usually taken to be an anchovy or some similar fish (vi. 15. 569b 26), but the present account suggests the great shoals of little atherines (see note on dcfrvr], 569a 31), which migrate into the Black Sea in spring, and are equally abundant in the Adriatic. ‘ Having passed the Straits of Constantinople, the shoals turn northwards, keeping close in to avoid the current which sweeps down towards the outlet’ (Ed. Forbes, op. tit. p. 204). 3 The Argonauts are said to have followed the same route, Apoll. Rh. iv. 283 ; but its existence is denied by Strabo, i. p. 153, and Plin. iii. 18. In Plin. ix. 20 the fishes are said to reach the Adriatic ‘ subterraneis venis ’.

598b
caught in that sea during their entry, but are caught during
their exit.
Tunny-fish swim into the Euxine keeping the shore on
20 their right, and swim out of it with the shore upon their
left.1 It is stated that they do so as being naturally weak
sighted, and seeing better with the right eye.2
During the daytime shoal-fish continue on their way,
but during the night they rest and feed.3 But if there be
moonlight, they continue their journey without resting at
all. Some people accustomed to sea-life assert that shoal
25 fish at the period of the winter'solstice never move at all,
but keep perfectly still wherever they may happen to have
been overtaken by the solstice, and this lasts until the
equinox.
The coly-mackerel is caught more frequently on entering
than on quitting the Euxine. And in the Propontis the
fish is at its best before the spawning season. Shoal-fish,
as a rule, are caught in greater quantities as they leave the
Euxine, and at that season they are in the best condition.4
30 At the time of their entrance they are caught in very
plump condition close to shore,5 but those are in compara¬
tively poor condition that are caught .farther out to sea.
599a Very often, when the coly-mackerel and the mackerel are
met by a south wind in their exit, there are better catches
to the southward than in the neighbourhood of Byzantium.
So much then for the phenomenon of migration of fishes.
Now the same phenomenon is observed in fishes as in
5 terrestrial animals in regard to hibernation : in other words,
during winter fishes take to concealing themselves in out of
the way places, and quit their places of concealment in the

warmer season. But, by the way, animals go into con¬
cealment by way of refuge against extreme heat, as well as
against extreme cold. Sometimes an entire genus will
thus seek concealment; in other cases some species will
do so and others will not. For instance, the shell-fish 10
seek concealment without exception, as is seen in the
case of those dwelling in the sea, the purple murex, the
ceryx, and all such like; but though in the case of the
detached species the phenomenon is obvious—for they
hide themselves, as is seen in the scallop, or they are pro¬
vided with an operculum on the free surface, as in the case
of land snails—in the case of the non-detached the con- 15
cealment is not so clearly observed. They do not go into
hiding at one and the same season; but the snails go
in winter, the purple murex and the ceryx for about thirty
days at the rising of the Dog-star, and the scallop at about
the same period. But for the most part they go into
concealment when the weather is either extremely cold
or extremely hot.
Insects almost all go into hiding, with the exception of 20
such of them as live in human habitations or perish before
the completion of the year. They1 hide in the winter ;
some of them for several days, others for only the coldest
days, as the bee. For the bee also goes into hiding: and
the proof that it does so is that during a certain period 25
bees never touch the food set before them, and if a bee
creeps out of the hive, it is quite transparent,2 with nothing
whatsoever in its stomach ; and the period of its rest and
hiding lasts from the setting of the Pleiads until spring¬
time.
Animals take their winter-sleep or summer-sleep by con¬
cealing themselves in warm places, or in places where they
have been used to lie concealed.

pholidotes or tessellates, namely, the serpent, the lizard,
the gecko, and the river-crocodile, all of which go into
hiding for four months in the depth of winter, and during that
599b time eat nothing. Serpents in general burrow under ground
for this purpose ; the viper conceals itself under a stone.
A great number of fishes also take this sleep,1 and notably,
the hippurus and coracinus in winter time; for, whereas
fish in general may be caught at all periods of the year
more or less, there is this singularity observed in these
fishes, that they are caught within a certain fixed period
5 of the year, and never by any chance out of it. The
muraena also hides, and the orphus or sea-perch, and the
conger. Rock-fish pair off, male and female, for hiding
(just as for breeding);2 as is observed in the case of the
species of wrasse called the thrush and the owzel,3 and
in the perch.
The tunny also takes a sleep in winter in deep waters,
10 and gets exceedingly fat after the sleep. The fishing
season for the tunny begins at the rising of the Pleiads and
lasts, at the longest, down to the setting of Arcturus;
during the rest of the year they are hid and enjoying im¬
munity. About the time of hibernation a few tunnies or
other hibernating fishes are caught while swimming about,
in particularly warm localities and in exceptionally fine
15 weather, or on nights of full moon; for the fishes are in¬
duced (by the warmth or the light) to emerge for a while
from their lair in quest of food.
Most fishes are at their best for the table during the
summer or winter sleep.
The primas-tunny conceals itself in the mud ;4 this may

be inferred from the fact that during a particular period
the fish is never caught, and that, when it is caught after
that period, it is covered with mud and has its fins damaged.
In the spring1 these tunnies get in motion and proceed 20
towards the coast, coupling and breeding, and the females
are now caught full of spawn. At this time they are
considered as in season, but in autumn and in winter as
of inferior quality; at this time also the males are full
of milt. When the spawn is small, the fish is hard to
catch, but it is easily caught when the spawn gets large, 25
as the fish is then infested by its parasite.2 Some fish
burrow for sleep in the sand and some in mud, just keeping
their mouths outside.
Most fishes hide, then, during the winter only, but crus¬
taceans, the rock-fish, the ray, and the cartilaginous species
hide only during extremely severe weather, and this may
be inferred from the fact that these fishes are never by any 30
chance caught when the weather is extremely cold. Some
fishes, however, hide during the summer, as the glaucus or
grey-back ; this fish hides in summer for about sixty days.3
The hake 4 also and the gilthead hide; and we infer that
the hake hides over a lengthened period from the fact 6ooa
that it is only caught at long intervals. We are led also
to infer that fishes hide in summer from the circumstance
that the takes of certain fish are made between the rise and
setting of certain constellations: of the Dog-star in par¬
ticular, the sea at this period being upturned from the
lower depths.5 This phenomenon may be observed to best
advantage in the Bosporus; for the mud is there brought 5
up to the surface and the fish are brought up along with

it. They say also that very often, when the sea-bottom is
dredged, more fish will be caught by the second haul than
by the first one. Furthermore, after very heavy rains
numerous specimens become visible of creatures that at
other times are never seen at all or seen only at intervals.
io A great number of birds also go into hiding ; they do 16
not all migrate, as is generally supposed, to warmer
countries. Thus, certain birds (as the kite and the swallow)
when they are not far off from places of this kind, in which
they have their permanent abode, betake themselves thither ;
others, that arc at a distance from such places, decline the
trouble of migration and simply hide themselves where
*5 they are. Swallows, for instance, have been often found in
holes,1 quite denuded of their feathers, and the kite on its
first emergence from torpidity has been seen to fly from
out some such hiding-place. And with regard to this
phenomenon of periodic torpor there is no distinction
observed, whether the talons of a bird be crooked or
straight; for instance, the stork, the owzel, the turtle-dove,
20 and the lark, all go into hiding. The case of the turtle¬
dove is the most notorious of all, for we would defy any
one to assert that he had anywhere seen a turtle-dove
in winter-time; at the beginning of the hiding time it is
exceedingly plump, and during this period it moults, but
retains its plumpness. Some cushats hide ; others, instead
25 of hiding, migrate at the same time as the swallow. The
thrush and the starling hide; and of birds with crooked
talons the kite and the owl hide for a few days.
Of viviparous quadrupeds the porcupine and the bear2 17
retire into concealment. The fact that the bear3 hides
is well established, but there are doubts as to its motive for
30 so doing, whether it be by reason of the cold or from some

other cause. About this period the male and the female
become so fat as to be hardly capable of motion. The
female brings forth her young at this time, and remains
in concealment until it is time to bring the cubs out; and 6oob
she brings them out in spring, about three months after
the winter solstice. The bear hides for at least forty days;
during fourteen of these days it is said not to move at all, but
during most of the subsequent days it moves, and from time 5
to time wakes up. A she-bear in pregnancy has either never
been caught at all or has been caught very seldom. There
can be no doubt but that during this period they eat nothing;
for in the first place they never emerge from their hiding
place, and further, when they are caught, their belly and
intestines are found to be quite empty. It is also said that
from no food being taken the gut almost closes up, and 10
that in consequence the animal on first emerging takes
to eating arum 1 with the view of opening up and distending
the gut.
The dormouse actually hides in a tree, and gets very
fat at that period ; as does also the white mouse of Pontus.
[Of animals that hide or go torpid some slough off what J5
is called their ‘ old-age \2 This name is applied to the
outermost skin, and to the casing that envelops the
developing organism.]3
In discussing the case of terrestrial vivipara we stated
that the reason for the bear’s seeking concealment is an
open question. We now proceed to treat of the tessellates.
The tessellates for the most part go into hiding, and if
their skin is soft they slough off their ‘ old-age ’, but not 20
if the skin is shell-like, as is the shell of the tortoise—for,
by the way, the tortoise and the freshwater tortoise belong
to the tessellates. Thus, the old-age is sloughed off by
the gecko, the lizard, and above all, by serpents ; and they

slough off the skin in springtime when emerging from their
25 torpor, and again in the autumn. Vipers also slough off
their skin both in spring and in autumn, and it is not the
case, as some aver, that this species of the serpent family is
exceptional in not sloughing. When the serpent begins to
slough, the skin peels off at first from the eyes, so that
any one ignorant of the phenomenon would suppose the
animal were going blind; after that it peels off the head,
and so on, until the creature presents to view only a white
30 surface all over.1 The sloughing goes on for a day and
a night, beginning with the head and ending with the tail.
During the sloughing of the skin an inner layer comes to
the surface,2 for the creature emerges just as the embryo
6oia from its afterbirth.
All insects that slough at all slough in the same way;
as the silphe,3 and the empis or midge,4 and all the coleo
ptera, as for instance the cantharus-beetle. They all slough
after the period of development; for just as the afterbirth
breaks from off the young of the vivipara so the outer husk
5 breaks off from around the young of the vermipara, in the
same way both with the bee and the grasshopper. The
cicada the moment after issuing from the husk5 goes and
sits upon an olive tree or a reed ; after the breaking up of
the husk the creature issues out, leaving a little moisture
behind, and after a short interval flies up into the air and
sets a-chirping.

sometimes in the spring, and sometimes in autumn after
parturition. Lobsters have been caught occasionally with
the parts about the thorax soft, from the shell having there
peeled off, and the lower parts hard, from the shell having,
not yet peeled off there; for, by the way, they do not
slough in the same manner as the serpent. The crawfish 15
hides for about five months. Crabs also slough off their
old-age; this is generally allowed with regard to the soft
shelled crabs, and it is said to be the case with the testa¬
ceous kind, as for instance with the large ‘ granny ’ crab.1
When these animals slough their shell becomes soft all
over, and as for the crab, it can scarcely crawl. These
animals also do not cast their skins once and for all, but 20
over and over again.
So much for the animals that go into hiding or torpidity,
for the times at which, and the ways in which, they go ; and
so much also for the animals that slough off their old-age,
and for the times at which they undergo the process.
18 Animals do not all thrive at the same seasons, nor do
they thrive alike during all extremes of weather. Further,
animals of diverse species are in a diverse way healthy or 25
sickly at certain seasons; and, in point of fact, some
animals have ailments that are unknown to others. Birds
thrive in times of drought, both in their general health and
in regard to parturition, and this is especially the case with
the cushat;2 fishes, however, with a few exceptions, thrive
best in rainy weather; on the contrary, rainy seasons3
are bad for birds—and so by the way is much drinking— 30
and drought is bad for fishes. 4 Birds of prey, as has been
already stated, may in a general way be said never to
drink at all,5 though Hesiod 6 appears to have been ignorant 6oib
of the fact, for in his story about the siege of Ninus he

represents the eagle that presided over the auguries as
in the act of drinking ; all other birds drink, but drink
5 sparingly, as is the case also with all other spongy-lunged
oviparous animals. Sickness in birds may be diagnosed
from their plumage, which is ruffled when they are sickly
instead of lying smooth as when they are well.
The majority of fishes, as has been stated, thrive 1 best 19
10 in rainy seasons. Not only have they food in greater
abundance at this time, but in a general way rain is whole¬
some for them just as it is for vegetation 2—for, by the way,
kitchen vegetables, though artificially watered, derive
benefit from rain ; and the same remark applies even to
15 reeds that grow in marshes, as they hardly grow at all
without a rainfall.3 That rain is good for fishes may be
inferred from the fact that most fishes migrate to the
Euxine for the summer ; for owing to the number of the
rivers that discharge into this sea its water is exceptionally
fresh, and the rivers bring down a large supply of food.
Besides, a great number of fishes, such as the bonito and
20 the mullet,4 swim up the rivers and thrive in the rivers
and marshes. The sea-gudgeon also fattens in the rivers,
and, as a rule, countries abounding in lagoons furnish
unusually excellent fish. While most fishes, then, are
benefited by rain, they are chiefly benefited by summer
rain; or we may state the case thus, that rain is good for
25 fishes in spring, summer, and autumn, and fine dry weather
in winter. As a general rule what is good for men is good
for fishes also.
Fishes do not thrive in cold places, and those fishes suffer
30 most in severe winters that have a stone in their head,
as the chromis, the basse, the sciaena,'' and the braize;

 BOOK VIII. 19 6oib
for owing to the stone they get frozen with the cold,1 2 and
are thrown up on shore.12
Whilst rain is wholesome for most fishes, it is, on the
contrary, unwholesome for the mullet, the cephalus, and 6o2a
the so-called marinus, for rain superinduces blindness in
most of these fishes, and all the more rapidly if the rainfall
be superabundant. The cephalus is peculiarly subject to
this malady in severe winters; their eyes grow white, and 5
when caught they are in poor condition, and eventually the
disease kills them. It would appear that this disease is
due to extreme cold even more than to an excessive rain¬
fall ; for instance, in many places and more especially in
shallows off the coast of Nauplia, in the Argolid, a number
of fishes have been known to be caught out at sea in 10
seasons of severe cold. The gilthead also suffers in winter ;
the acharnas 3 suffers in summer, and loses condition. The
coracine is exceptional among fishes in deriving benefit
from drought, and this is due to the fact that heat and
drought are apt to come together.
Particular places suit particular fishes ; some are naturally 15
fishes of the shore, and some of the deep sea, and some are
at home in one or the other of these regions, and others are
common to the two and are at home in both. Some fishes
will thrive in one particular spot, and in that spot only.
As a general rule it may be said that places abounding in
weeds are wholesome; at all events, fishes caught in such
places are exceptionally fat: that is, such fishes as inhabit
all sorts of localities as well. The fact is that weed-eating 20
fishes find abundance of their special food in such localities,
and carnivorous fish find an unusually large number of
smaller fish. It matters also whether the wind be from the
north or south: the longer fish thrive better when a north
wind prevails, and in summer at one and the same spot

 602a HISTORIA ANIMALIUM
25 more long fish will be caught than 1 flat fish with a north
wind blowing.
The tunny and the sword-fish are infested with a parasite
about the rising of the Dog-star;2 that is to say, about
this time both these fishes have a grub beside their fins
that is nicknamed the ‘gadfly’.3 It resembles the scorpion
in shape, and is about the size of the spider. So acute
is the pain it inflicts that the sword-fish 4 will often leap
30 as high out of the water as a dolphin ; in fact, it sometimes
leaps over the bulwarks of a vessel and falls back on the
deck. The tunny delights more than any other fish in
the heat of the sun. It will burrow for warmth in the sand
6o2b in shallow waters near to shore, or will, because it is warm,
disport itself on the surface of the sea.
The fry of little fishes escape by being overlooked, for it
is only the larger ones of the small species that fishes of
the large species will pursue. The greater part of the
spawn and the fry of fishes is destroyed by the heat of
5 the sun,5 for whatever of them the sun reaches it spoils.
Fishes are caught in greatest abundance before sunrise
and after sunset, or, speaking generally, just about sunset
and sunrise.6 Fishermen haul up their nets at these
times, and speak of the hauls then made as the ‘ nick-of
time’ hauls. The fact is, that at these times fishes are parti
10 cularly weaksighted ; at night they are at rest, and as the
light grows stronger they see comparatively well.
We know of no pestilential malady attacking fishes, such
as those which attack man, and horses and oxen among the
quadrupedal vivipara, and certain species of other genera,
1 k(il MSS., Bekk.; fj Aldine, and most commentators. 2 H. A. v. 31. 557a 27, viii. 15. 599^ 26 ; Plin. ix. 21 ; Opp. Hal. ii. 506 ; Athen. vii. p. 302. 3 These parasites are parasitic copepods; that of the sword-fish is Pennella Jilosa (L.), and to its elongated form the present description seems best to apply. The chief species infesting the tunny is Brachiella thynni (Cuv.), but Cecrops Latreillii, Leach, is said also, by Milne Edwards, to infest that fish. Cf. Steenstrup and Liitken, K. Danske Vid.

 BOOK VIII. 19 602b
domesticated and wild ; but fishes do seem to suffer from 15
sickness; and fishermen infer this from the fact that at
times fishes in poor condition, and looking as though they
were sick, and of altered colour, are caught in a large haul
of well-conditioned fish of their own species. So much for
sea-fishes.
20 River-fish and lake-fish also are exempt from diseases of 20
a pestilential character, but certain species are subject to
special and peculiar maladies. For instance, the sheat-fish 1
just before the rising of the Dog-star, owing to its swim¬
ming near the surface of the water, is liable to sunstroke,
and is paralysed by a loud peal of thunder. The carp
is subject to the same eventualities, but in a lesser degree.
The sheat-fish is destroyed in great quantities in shallow 25
waters by the serpent called the dragon.2 In the balerus
and tilon 3 a worm is engendered about the rising of the
Dog-star, that sickens these fish and causes them to rise
towards the surface, where they are killed by the excessive
heat. The chalcis is subject to a very violent malady ;4 lice
are engendered underneath their gills in great numbers,5
and cause destruction among them; but no other species 3°
of fish is subject to any such malady.
If mullein be introduced into water it will kill fish in its
vicinity.6 It is used extensively for catching fish in rivers and
ponds ;7 by the Phoenicians it is made use of also in the sea. 6o3a
There are two other methods employed for catching fish.
1 Plin. ix. 25. 2 Plin. l.c. ‘silurus Caniculae exortu sideratur’. I am not aware of ‘ the dragon ’ being a mythical expression for thunder, though it is, in Semitic literature, for the earthquake (cf. Isa. xxi. 9), and I suspect that 117ro dpaaovTos should read vno fipovrris ; the whole phrase may have been something like vno (3p. rfj 0Xoyi. 3 This is the curious word that Herodotus tells us belonged to the language of the Macedonian lake-dwellers. I suspect that it is a synonym of yXdvis, or Silurus, and akin to the S. German Seile, a name for the same fish. Cf. Kner, SB. Akad. Wien, 1864, p. 336. 4 Plin. ix. 71. As remarked under iv. 9. 535^ 18, this fish is conjectured to be the John Dory, Zeus faber. A parasitic copepod, Chondraumthus zei, is very common and conspicuous on the gills of the fish, but is scarcely so conspicuous as to confirm the identification. 5 Reading noWoi.

 HISTORIA ANIMALIUM
6o3a
It is a known fact that in winter fishes emerge from the
deep parts of rivers—and, by the way, at all seasons fresh
water is tolerably cold. A trench accordingly is dug
5 leading into a river, and wattled at the river end with reeds
and stones, an aperture being left in the wattling through
which the river water flows into the trench; when the frost
comes on the fish can be taken out of the trench in weels.
Another method is adopted in summer and winter alike.
They run across a stream a dam composed of brushwood
io and stones, leaving a small open space, and in this space
they insert a weel ; they then coop the fish in towards
this place, and draw them up in the weel as they swim
through the open space.1
Shell-fish, as a rule, are benefited by rainy weather. The
purple murex is an exception ; if it be placed on a shore
near to where a river discharges, it will die within a day
15 after tasting the fresh water. The murex lives for about
fifty days after capture; during this period they feed off
one another,2 as there grows on the shell a kind of sea¬
weed or sea-moss ; if any food is thrown to them during
this period, it is said to be done not to keep them alive,
but to make them weigh more.
To shell-fish in general drought is unwholesome." During
20 dry weather they decrease in size and degenerate in quality;
and it is during such weather that the red scallop is found
in more than usual abundance.4 In the Pyrrhaean Strait
the clam was exterminated, partly by the dredging-machine
used in their capture, and partly by long-continued
droughts. Rainy weather is wholesome to the generality
of shell-fish owing to the fact that the sea-water then
25 becomes exceptionally sweet. In the Euxine, owing to the
coldness of the climate, shell-fish are not found : nor yet
in rivers, excepting a few bivalves here and there. Uni

valves, by the way, are very apt to freeze to death in
extremely cold weather. So much for animals that live
in water.
21 1To turn to quadrupeds,2 the pig suffers from three 30
diseases,3 one of which is called branchos,4 a disease attended
with swellings about the windpipe5 and the jaws.6 It may
break out in any part of the body ; very often it attacks 603
the foot, and occasionally the ear; the neighbouring parts
also soon rot, and the decay goes on until it reaches the
lungs, when the animal succumbs. The disease develops
with great rapidity, and the moment it sets in the animal
gives up eating. The swineherds know but one way to 5
cure it, namely, by complete excision, when they detect
the first signs of the disease. There are two other diseases,
which are both alike termed craurus.7 The one is attended
with pain and heaviness in the head, and this is the com¬
moner of the two, the other with diarrhoea. The latter
is incurable, the former is treated by applying wine fomenta- 10
tions to the snout and rinsing the nostrils with wine. Even

G. iii. 497; Plin. viii. 77; Colum. vii. 10. 4 Under fipayxos, two or more diseases appear to be confused. The inflammatory swellings about the windpipe and jaws, and the rapid and fatal course of the disease, correspond to the symptoms of anthrax. But the affection of the feet suggests more especially foot-and-mouth disease, or ‘ epizootic aphtha’, in which the hooves tend to rot or slough away. This latter disease in most cases yields to treatment, and to it the subsequent and disconnected paragraph on 0pdy\os very probably refers. 5 Note the use of fipdyxia. for windpipe, as in de Spiritu, 5. 483a 22, both passages being in all probability spurious. 6 Verg. l.c. ‘ et quatit aegros Tussis anhela sues, ac faucibus angit obesis.’ 7 The two varieties of Kpavpos cannot be identified with any approach to certainty. The drooping head is an early symptom of almost any disease. Diarrhoea is a common, but not invariable symptom, of the fatal malady known as swine fever. Suid., s. v. didppoia, describes /3payx^, Kpavpn, and huippoin as the three diseases of swine. According to Varro, R.R. ii. 4, the seller should give a warranty that his pigs are ‘ a febri et a foria perfunctas ’, i. e. ‘ free from fever and from diarrhoea ’.


 60315 HISTORIA ANIMALIUM
this disease is very hard to cure; it has been known to kill
within three or four days. The animal is chiefly subject to
branchos when it gets extremely fat, and when the heat has
brought a good supply of figs.1 The treatment is to feed
15 on mashed mulberries, to give repeated warm baths, and
to lance the under part of the tongue.
Pigs with flabby flesh are subject to measles2 about the
legs, neck, and shoulders, for the pimples develop chiefly
in these parts.3 If the pimples are few in number the flesh
is comparatively sweet, but if they be numerous it gets
20 watery and flaccid. The symptoms of measles are obvious,
for the pimples show chiefly on the under side of the
tongue, and if you pluck the bristles off the chine the skin
will appear suffused with blood, and further the animal
will be unable to keep its hind-feet at rest. Pigs never
25 take this disease while they are mere sucklings. The
pimples may be got rid of by feeding on a kind of spelt
called tiphe;4 and this spelt, by the way, is very good for
ordinary food. The best food for rearing and fattening
pigs is chickpeas and figs, but the one thing essential is
to vary the food as much as possible, for this animal, like
30 animals in general, delights in a change of diet; and it is
said that one kind of food blows the animal out, that
another superinduces flesh, and that another puts on fat,
and that acorns, though liked by the animal, render the
flesh flaccid. Besides, if a sow eats acorns in great quanti

Colum. ft. ft. vii. 10 ‘ Solet etiam vitiosi splenis dolor eas infestare, quod accidit quum siccitas magna provenit, et, ut Bucolicum loquitur poema, Strata tacent passim sua quaeque sub arbore poma ’. 2 The ‘ measles * here alluded to are the cysticercus-cysts of the tape-worm. It is the case that the cysts or pimples are to be detected chiefly on, or rather under, the tongue, but I am not aware that there are symptoms of cutaneous suffusion. Indeed the statement as to this latter symptom is very possibly misplaced ; the symptom is mentioned by Pliny as a general sign of ill-health, or of the presence of angina or struma (Plin. viii. 77 ‘ index suis invalidae cruor in radice setae dorso evulsae, caput obliquum [s. obstipum] in incessu’). 3 Ruf.

ties, it will miscarry, as is also the case with the ewe; and,
indeed, the miscarriage is more certain in the case of the
ewe than in the case of the sow. The pig is the only
animal known to be subject to measles.
22 Dogs suffer from three diseases; rabies, quinsy, and sore
feet. Rabies drives the animal mad, and any animal what- 5
ever, excepting man, will take the disease if bitten by a
dog so afflicted ; the disease is fatal to the dog itself, and
to any animal it may bite, man excepted.1 Quinsy 2 also is
fatal to dogs; and only a few dogs recover from disease of
the feet. The camel, like the dog, is subject to rabies. 10
The elephant, which is reputed to enjoy immunity from all
other illnesses, is occasionally subject to flatulency.3
23 Cattle in herds are liable to two diseases, foot-sickness
and craurus.4 In the former their feet suffer from eruptions,
but the animal recovers from the disease without even the 15
loss of the hoof. It is found of service to smear the horny
parts with warm pitch.5 In craurus, the breath comes warm
at short intervals ; in fact, craurus in cattle answers to fever
in man. The symptoms of the disease are drooping of the
ears and disinclination for food. The animal soon succumbs, 20
and when the carcase is opened the lungs are found to
be rotten.
24 Horses out at pasture are free from all diseases excepting
disease of the feet. From this disease they sometimes lose

25 their hooves: but after losing them they grow them soon
again, for as one hoof is decaying it is being replaced by
another. Symptoms of the malady are a sinking in and
wrinkling of the lip in the middle under the nostrils,
and in the case of the male, a twitching of the right
testicle.1
Stall-reared horses are subject to very numerous forms
of disease. They are liable to a disease called * eileus
b04b Under this disease the animal trails its hind-legs under its
belly so far forward as almost to fall back on its haunches;
if it goes without food for several days and turns rabid,2 * it
may be of service to draw blood, or to castrate the male."
The animal is subject also to tetanus: the veins get rigid,
5 as also the head and neck, and the animal walks with its
legs stretched out straight. The horse suffers also from
abscesses. Another painful illness afflicts them called the
‘ barley -surfeit ’. The symptoms are a softening of the
palate and heat of the breath ;4 5 the animal may recover
through the strength of its own constitution, but no formal
remedies are of any avail.
10 ■’ There is also a disease called nymphia, in which the

The casting of the hooves is a result of poisoning by ergot, as well as of various eruptive diseases of the feet. 2 Schn. points out that this sentence is somehow corrupt. I think that ras epnpoaOev is interpolated by repetition from the line above; and I imagine that the true reading was eav 8’ daiTTjo-as Tpiepas enra pivp. Possibly also (KTepvnvTts (qy. eKTerpripei/ovs) may have been drawn in from the next clause ; in other words, the statement may have been that lockjaw sometimes follows castration, as is indeed the case. On tetanus in horses cf. Hippiatr. p. 119. f’lXevs probably includes cases of ordinary colic; but the descrip¬ tion further suggests the disease known as ‘ staggers or coma somnolentum, much commoner in the south of Europe than with us, in which disease the legs are contorted into curious positions. 4 Cf. Colum.vi. 14. 2 ‘ Interdumet tumor palati cibos respuit crebrumque suspirium facit ’, &c. In the account of Kpidlna-is by Apsyrtus, in Hippiatr. i. c. 7, an ovpavio-Kos fiereapos is spoken of in connexion with it, apparently from a notion connected with the doctrine of signatures. According to Vegetius, iii. 44, tcpiOiaais is simply indigestion, or surfeit. 5 The whole chapter is difficult, and this paragraph especially obscure. Scaliger translates KaTtx*v&111 * inhiberi\ Schneider, on the other hand, suggests {Cur. post. iv. p. 473) that Kurexeadm = k(ito\os uvai, i. e. ‘to be demented, or possessed ’; cf. k.

animal is said to stand still and droop its head on hearing
flute-music; if during this ailment the horse be mounted,
it will run off at a gallop until it is pulled.1 Even with
this rabies in full force, it preserves a dejected spiritless
appearance ; some of the symptoms are a throwing back of
the ears followed by a projection of them, great languor,
and heavy2 breathing. Heart-ache3 also is incurable, of 15
which the symptom is a drawing in of the flanks;4 and so
is displacement of the bladder,5 which is accompanied by
a retention of urine and a drawing up of the hooves and
haunches. Neither is there any cure if the animal swallow
the grape-beetle, which is about the size of the sphondyle
or knuckle-beetle.0 The bite of the shrewmouse7 is
dangerous to horses and other draught animals as well; 20
it is followed by boils./ The bite is all the more dangerous
if the mouse be pregnant when she bites, for the boils then
burst, but do not burst otherwise. The cicigna8 9—called
‘ chalcis5 by some, and ‘ zignis ’ by others—either causes
death by its bite or, at all events, intense pain; it is like
a small lizard, with the colour of the blind snake. In point 25
of fact, according to experts, the horse and the sheep have
pretty well as many ailments as the human species. The
drug known under the name of c sandarace5 or realgar, is
extremely injurious0 to a horse, and to all draught animals;
it is given to the animal as a medicine in a solution of
water, the liquid being filtered through a colander. The
mare when pregnant is apt to miscarry when disturbed by 3°

the odour of an extinguished candle;1 and a similar
605a accident happens occasionally to women in their pregnancy.
So much for the diseases of the horse.
The so-called hippomanes 2 grows, as has been stated,3
on the foal, and the mare nibbles it off as she licks and
cleans the foal. All the curious stories connected with the
5 hippomanes are due to old wives and to the venders of
charms. What is called the ‘ polium ’ or foal’s membrane,
is, as all the accounts state, delivered by the mother before
the foal appears.
A horse will recognize the neighing of any other horse
with which it may have fought at any previous period.
The horse delights in meadows and marshes, and likes to
io drink muddy water; in fact, if water be clear, the horse4
will trample in it to make it turbid, will then drink it, and
afterwards will wallow in it.5 The animal is fond of water
in every way, whether for drinking or for bathing purposes ;
and this explains the peculiar constitution of the hippo¬
potamus or river-horse. In regard to water the ox is the
opposite of the horse ; for if the water be impure or cold, or
15 mixed up with alien matter, it will refuse to drink it.
The ass suffers chiefly from one particular disease 0 which 25
they call ‘ melis It arises first in the head, and a clammy
humour runs down the nostrils, thick and red ; if it stays in
the head the animal may recover, but if it descends into
the lungs the animal will die. Of all animals of its kind
20 it is the least capable of enduring extreme cold, which
circumstance will account for the fact that the animal is
not found on the shores of the Euxine, nor in Scythia.7

26 Elephants suffer from flatulence, and when thus afflicted
can void neither solid nor liquid residuum.1 If the elephant
swallow earth-mould 2 it suffers from relaxation ; but if it 25
go on taking it steadily, it will experience no harm. From
time to time it takes to swallowing stones. It suffers also
from diarrhoea: in this case they administer draughts of
lukewarm water or dip its fodder in honey, and either one
or the other prescription will prove a costive. When they
suffer from insomnia, they will be restored to health if
their shoulders be rubbed with salt, olive-oil, and warm 3°
water; when they have aches in their shoulders they will
derive great benefit from the application of roast pork.3 605b
Some elephants like olive-oil, and others do not. If there
is a bit of iron in the inside of an elephant it is said that it
will pass out if the animal takes a drink of olive-oil;4 if
the animal refuses olive-oil, they soak a root5 in the oil and
give it the root to swallow. 5
So much, then, for quadrupeds.

Ael. ii. 18) notes the unlikelihood of this cure, and suspects that the olive oil was actually given as an antidote to poison, and that in the original account drawn on by Aristotle and others there was a confusion between Ids, a dart, and 10s, venom. 5 The MSS. are at variance, and our text is according to A. and W.’s conjecture.

 b HISTORIA ANIMALIUM
In bee-hives are found creatures that do great damage to
io the combs; for instance, the grub that spins a web and
ruins the honey-comb:1 it is called the ‘cleros’. It engen¬
ders an insect like itself,2 of a spider-shape, and brings
disease into the swarm. There is another insect resembling
the moth, called by some the ‘ pyraustes ’,3 that flies about
a lighted candle: this creature engenders a brood full of
15 a fine down. It is never stung by a bee, and can only be
got out of a hive by fumigation. A caterpillar also is en¬
gendered in hives, of a species nicknamed the teredo, or
‘ borer ’, with which creature the bee never interferes. Bees
suffer most when flowers are covered with mildew, or in
seasons of drought.
All insects, without exception, die if they be smeared
20 over with oil ;4 and they die all the more rapidly if you
smear their head 5 with the oil and lay them out in the sun.
6 Variety in animal life may be produced by variety of 28
locality : thus in one place an animal will not be found
at all, in another it will be small, or short-lived, or will not
25 thrive.7 Sometimes this sort of difference is observed in
closely adjacent districts. Thus, in the territory of Miletus,
it is not in spring that insects are most plentiful. The sentence appears to be parallel to the opening one of c. 19, and there is a somewhat similar one in P. A. iv. 5. 68oa 28. I look with suspicion on iv jjntp oopa, and conjecture in place thereof peroTrupov ; i.e. ‘ insects especially flourish and abound in autumn, when the season is moist, mild, and spring-like’ (pcronaipov vypov udi votiov, Probl. i. 10. 86oa 36). 1 H. A. ix. 40. 626b 15 ; Plin. xi. 16, 20. 21 ; Colum. ix. 7. 13. 2 The words opoiov eavrip are very doubtful, and Dittm. would omit them. 3 Transferred, according to Schneider’s suggestion, from its usual place in the text, where it is a synonym of kXrjpos.

Cf. also Ael. xii. 8, and Aesch. ibi cit. Schn. and Sundevall agree that kXrjpos is our Trichodes (Clerus) apiarius, a beetle ; the ‘ moth ’ (\j>apilio of Pliny, xi. 21, tinea of Vergil, G. iv. 246, and Colum. ix. 14) is the common ‘ wax-moth’, Galleria cereana or mellonella ; the cater¬ pillars called T(pr)8uvts are the larvae of the last-named (cf.

blood and such as go into hiding or go torpid 8 are all of
immense size there. In the Euxine there are no small 10

are shorn for their fleece, just as sheep are in all other
countries.1 In Libya the long-horned ram2 is born with
horns, and not the ram only, as Homer3 words it, but the
20 ewe as well; 4 in Pontus, on the confines of Scythia, the
ram is without horns.
In Egypt animals, as a rule, are larger than their
congeners in Greece,5 as the cow and the sheep ; but some
are less, as the dog, the wolf, the hare, the fox, the raven,
and the hawk; others are of pretty much the same size, as
25 the crow and the goat. The difference, where it exists, is
attributed to the food, as being abundant in one case and
insufficient in another, for instance for the wolf and the
hawk ; for provision is scanty6 for the carnivorous animals,
6o6b small birds being scarce; food is scanty also for the hare
and for all frugivorous animals, because neither the nuts nor
the fruit last long.7
In many places the climate will account for peculiarities;
thus in Illyria, Thrace, and Epirus the ass is small, and in
5 Gaul and in Scythia the ass is not found at all owing to the
coldness of the climate of these countries.8 In Arabia the
lizard is more than a cubit in length,9 and the mouse 10 is

serpents is something appalling; sailors spin a yarn to 10
the effect that some crews once put ashore and saw the
bones of a number of oxen, and that they were sure that
the oxen had been devoured by serpents, for, just as they
were putting out to sea, serpents came chasing their galleys
at full speed and overturned one galley and set upon the
crew. Again, lions are more numerous in Libya,2 and in
that district of Europe that lies between the Achelous and 15
the Nessus ;3 the leopard is more abundant in Asia Minor,
and is not found in Europe at all. As a general rule, wild
animals are at their wildest in Asia, at their boldest in
Europe, and most diverse in form in Libya ; in fact, there
is an old saying, ‘ Always something fresh in Libya.’ 4 2o
It would appear that in that country animals of diverse
species meet, on account of the rainless climate, at the
watering-places, and there pair together; and that such
pairs will often breed if they be nearly of the same size
and have periods of gestation of the same length. For
it is said that they are tamed down in their behaviour to¬
wards each other by extremity of thirst. And, by the way,
unlike animals elsewhere, they require to drink more in
winter-time than in summer : for they acquire the habit 25
of not drinking in summer, owing to the circumstance that
there is usually no water then; and the mice, if they drink,
die.5 Elsewhere also bastard-animals are born to hetero- 6o7a
geneous pairs; thus in Cyrene the wolf and the bitch will

couple and breed;1 and the Laconian hound is a cross
between the fox and the dog.~ They say that the Indian
dog is a cross between the tiger and the bitch, not the first
5 cross, but a cross in the third generation; for they say that
the first cross is a savage creature.3 4 They take the bitch to
a lonely spot and tie her up: if the tiger be in an amorous
mood he will pair with her; if not he will eat her up, and
this casualty is of frequent occurrence.
4 Locality will differentiate habits also: for instance, rugged 29
to highlands will not produce the same results as the soft low¬
lands. The animals of the highlands look fiercer and bolder,
as is seen in the swine of Mount Athos ; for a lowland boar
is no match even for a mountain sow.
Again, locality is an important element in regard to the
bite of an animal. Thus, in Pharos and other places, the
5 bite of the scorpion is not dangerous; elsewhere—in Caria,5
for instance,—where scorpions are venomous as well as
plentiful and of large size, the sting is fatal to man or
beast, even to the pig, and especially to a black pig,6 though
the pig, by the way, is in general most singularly indifferent
to the bite of any other creature. If a pig goes into water
after being struck by the scorpion of Caria,5 it will surely die.
There is great variety in the effects produced by the
bites of serpents. The asp is found in Libya ; the so-called
‘ septic ’ drug is made from the body of the animal, and is
the only remedy known for the bite of the original.7 Among
the silphium, also, a snake is found, for the bite of which
a certain stone is said to be a cure: a stone that is brought
from the grave of an ancient king, which stone is put into

water and drunk off. In certain parts of Italy1 the bite of
the gecko is fatal. But the deadliest of all bites of
venomous creatures is when one venomous animal has
bitten another ; as, for instance, a viper’s after it has bitten
a scorpion. To the great majority of such creatures man’s
spittle is fatal.2 There is a very little snake, by some 3Q
entitled the 6 holy-snake which is dreaded by even the
largest serpents.3 It is about an ell long, and hairy
looking; whenever it bites an animal, the flesh all round
the wound will at once mortify. There is in India a small
snake which is exceptional in this respect, that for its bite
no specific whatever is known.
30 Animals also vary as to their condition of health in 6o7b
connexion with their pregnancy.
Testaceans, such as scallops and all the oyster-family,
and crustaceans, such as the lobster-family, are best when
with spawn. Even in the case of the testacean we speak 4
of spawning (or pregnancy); but whereas the crustaceans
may be seen coupling and laying their spawn, this is never
the case with testaceans.5 Molluscs are best in the breeding 5
time, as the calamary, the sepia, and the octopus.
Fishes, when they begin to breed, are nearly all good for
the table; but after the female has gone long with spawn
they are good in some cases, and in others are out of season.
The maenis, for instance, is good at the breeding time.
The female of this fish is round, the male longer and flatter ; 10
6 when the female is beginning to breed the male turns
black and mottled,7 and is quite unfit for the table ; at this
period he is nicknamed the ‘ goat ’.
1 According to Theophrastus ap. Plin. viii. 49, it is in Gi'eece that the creature’s bite is fatal. Cf. Ps.-Arist. de Mirab. 148. 845^ 4 ; Plin. xxix. 28. 2 Plin. vii. 2 ; Nic. Tlier. 86. 3 Ci.deMirab. 151.8451316; Theophr.C/^?r.xxviii(xvi). This snake is apparently the o-ryn-eduv of Ael. xv. 18 and Nic. Ther. 320.

*5 The wrasses called the owzel and the thrush, and the
smaris 1 have different colours at different seasons, as is the
case with the plumage of certain birds ; that is to say, they
become black in the spring and after the spring get white
again. The phycis also changes its hue: in general it is
white, but in spring it is mottled ; it is the only sea-fish
20 which is said to make a bed for itself, and the female lays
her spawn in this bed or nest.2 The maenis, as was
observed, changes its colour as does the smaris, and in
summer-time changes back from whitish to black, the
change being especially marked about the fins and gills.
The coracine, like the maenis, is in best condition at
25 breeding time; the mullet, the basse, and scaly3 fishes in
general are in bad condition at this period.4 A few fish
are in much the same condition at all times, whether with
spawn or not, as the glaucus. Old fishes also are bad
eating ; the old tunny is unfit even for pickling, as a great
part of its flesh wastes away with age, and the same
30 wasting is observed in all old fishes. The age of a scaly
fish may be told by the size and the hardness of its scales.
An old tunny has been caught weighing fifteen talents,5
with the span of its tail two 6 cubits and a palm broad.
River-fish and lake-fish are best after they have dis
6o8a charged the spawn in the case of the female and the milt
in the case of the male : that is, when they have fully
recovered from the exhaustion of such discharge. Some
are good in the breeding time, as the saperdis,7 and some
bad, as the sheat-fish. As a general rule, the male fish
is better eating than the female ; but the reverse holds
5 good of the sheat-fish. The eels that are called females
are the best for the table: they look as though they were
female, but they really are not so.s

 BOOK IX
I Of the animals that are comparatively obscure and short- 608
lived the characters or dispositions 1 are not so obvious to
recognition as are those of animals that are longer-lived.
These latter animals appear to have a natural capacity
corresponding to each of the passions: to cunning or 15
simplicity, courage or timidity, to good temper or to bad,
and to other similar dispositions of mind.2
Some also are capable of giving or receiving instruction
of receiving it from one another or from man : those that
have the faculty of hearing, for instance; and, not to limit
the matter to audible sound, such as can differentiate the 20
suggested meanings of word and gesture.3
In all genera in which the distinction of male and female
is found, Nature makes a similar differentiation in the
mental characteristics of the two sexes. This differentiation
1 The fjSq are the natural dispositions or mental characters. On the rjdq of different animals cf. H. A. i. 1. 488b 12, viii. 1. 588a 18, ix. 3. 6iob 20, &c. 2 In the beginning of the eighth book the psychological characteristics of animals are treated in a simple and elementary way. In certain passages of the ethical works, e.g. Eth. Eudem. ii. 2. 1220, the same characteristics are discussed in a more technical way, with a freer use of philosophical terms of definition. While here, in the opening of the ninth book, the subject is more briefly and less lucidly treated than in the eighth, yet we may remark the employment of a more refined terminology, to explain which we must have recourse to the passage in the Eth. Eudem. referred to above. There we are taught the distinction between the nadq or nadqp.aTa Ttjs \f/v\qs, inherent ‘accidents’ of the mind, such as fear, shame, appetite, desire : next the 8vvdp.eis twv TvadquaTiov, by which the former are brought into action and one is hungry or thirsty, afraid or ashamed : and lastly the egeis npos rd nddq, the mental dispositions or inclinations, such as sobriety or intemperance, cowardice or courage, which, according to Aristotle, cause these dwapeis to subsist in proper or improper degree, ocrai ainai eiVt rod ravra q Kara \6yov V7rdpxeiv *7 ivavr'uos.

is the most obvious in the case of human kind and in that
of the larger animals and the viviparous quadrupeds. In
25 the case of these latter the female is softer in character, is
the sooner tamed, admits more readily of caressing, is more
apt in the way of learning ; as, for instance, in the Laconian
breed of dogs the female is cleverer than the male.1 Of
the Molossian breed of dogs,2 such as are employed in the
chase are pretty much the same3 as those elsewhere ; but
30 the sheep-dogs of this breed are superior to the others in
size, and in the courage with which they face the attacks
of wild animals.4
Dogs that are born of a mixed breed between these two
kinds are remarkable for courage and endurance of hard
labour.
In all cases, excepting those of the bear and leopard,5
the female is less spirited than the male; in regard to the
two exceptional cases, the superiority in courage rests with
the female. With all other animals the female is softer
6o8b in disposition than the male, is more mischievous, less
simple, more impulsive, and more attentive to the nurture
of the young; the male, on the other hand, is more spirited
than the female, more savage, more simple and less cunning.
The traces of these differentiated characteristics are more
or less visible everywhere, but they are especially visible
5 where character is the more developed, and most of all
in man.
The fact is, the nature of man is the most rounded off
and complete, and consequently in man the qualities or
capacities above referred to are found in their perfection.
1 Cf. H. A. vi. 20. 574® 16; Plin. x. 83 ‘ propria in eo genere maribus laboris alacritas ’. 2 This passage is foreign to a context that deals with differences of sex and not of breed, and the phrase to S’ uk6\ov6ov toj? npo&drois, as A. and W. remark, is not Aristotelian. We do not read elsewhere in Greek, though occasionally in Latin (e. g. Lucan iv. 440), of the Molossian breed as hunting-dogs, but only (cf. Suid. s.v.) as sheep¬ dogs, nor of the cross between the Molossian and Laconian breeds.
3 Scaliger has a singular note on olbev diafapu npos to napa ro'is nWois:
‘Mira locutio philosophica. to hie significat rjdoi} napa significat non substantiam sed accidens proprium inhaerens.’ He is apparently unwilling to translate diafepci npds, ‘differs from,’ which however occurs, e. g. H.A. iii. 19. 52121 to 8e tu>v 6t)\(iu>v [ni)xa] npos to tu)V appevoiv dia(f)(pei. 4 Opp. Cyti. i. 373. 6 Plin. xi. Iio.


 BOOK IX. i 6o8b
Hence woman is more compassionate than man, more
easily moved to tears, at the same time is more jealous,
more querulous, more apt to scold and to strike. She is,
furthermore, more prone to despondency and less hopeful
than the man, more void of shame or self-respect, more false
of speech, more deceptive, and of more retentive memory.
She is also more wakeful, more shrinking, more difficult to
rouse to action, and requires a smaller quantity of nutriment.
As was previously stated, the male is more courageous
than the female, and more sympathetic in the way of
standing by to help. Even in the case of molluscs, when
the cuttle-fish is struck with the trident the male stands by
to help the female; but when the male is struck the female
runs away.1
There is enmity between such animals as dwell in the
same localities or subsist on the same food. If the means
of subsistence run short, creatures of like kind will fight
together. Thus it is said that seals which inhabit one and
the same district will fight, male with male, and female
with female, until one combatant kills the other, or one
is driven away by the other; and their young do even
in like manner.
All creatures are at enmity with the carnivores, and the
carnivores with all the rest, for they all subsist on living
creatures. Soothsayers take notice of cases where animals
keep apart from one another, and cases where they con¬
gregate together;2 calling those that live at war with one
another * dissociates and those that dwell in peace with
one another ‘ associates ’. One may go so far as to say that
if there were no lack or stint of food, then those animals
that are now afraid of man or are wild by nature would
be tame and familiar with him, and in like manner with
one another. This is shown by the way animals are treated

in Egypt, for owing to the fact that food is constantly
supplied to them the very fiercest creatures live peaceably
together. The fact is they are tamed by kindness, and in
a some places crocodiles are tame to their priestly keeper
from being fed by him. And elsewhere also the same
phenomenon is to be observed.1
The eagle and the snake are enemies,2 for the eagle lives
5 on snakes ;3 so are the ichneumon 4 and the venom-spider,
for the ichneumon preys upon the latter. In the case of
birds, there is mutual enmity between the poecilis, the
crested lark, the woodpecker (?)-, and the chloreus, for they
devour one another’s eggs; so also between the crow and
the owl;5 for, owing to the fact that the owl is dim

They are unintelligible as they stand, but wemight perhaps link them with the following sentence, translating ‘And now, of these (friendly or hostile) animals in detail’. What follows is largely fabulous, partly mystical, and apparently from another hand. For similar accounts of the friendships or hostilities of animals see Ael. i. 32, iv. 5, v. 48, vi. 22 ; Plin. x. 95 ; Plut. de Od. et Inv.; Phile, 675-730, &c. 2 Aristotle cites about forty instances of hostility between certain animals ; of these forty about one-half are mentioned elsewhere, fourteen or fifteen by Pliny, nine or ten by Phile, about as many by Aelian, and a few by Plutarch, Antoninus Liberalis, and other authors. From these authors together we may compile a list of nearly a hundred such instances. It is highly probable that these form a fragmentary catalogue of the Siedpicu ml avvedpiai observed, as is stated above, by the soothsayers. In my Gl. ofGk. Birds and elsewhere I have attempted to trace in certain cases a correspondence between the animals referred to and the oppositions or juxtapositions of their stellar namesakes: if we are indeed dealing with a soothsayer’s catalogue, it is all the more likely that such occasional astrological coincidences should exert their influence on it. In the Aristotelian list we have a very considerable number of names not mentioned elsewhere, of unknown meaning, and very possibly of foreign derivation. 3 e. g. Circaetus gallicus. 4 Not the Egyptian quadruped, but a species of wasp, e.g. Pompilus or Calicurgus; cf. Fabre, Souv. Entom. 1882, p. 206 ; Plin. x. 95 (74) ‘ ichneumones vespae et phalangia aranei [dissident]’. Cf. H. A. v. 20 ; Plin. xi. 24 (21). The name as applied to the insects (Sfhegidae or Pompilidae), which lay their eggs in the living bodies of other insects or of spiders, seems to be connected with an Egyptian fable of the true ichneumon told in Ael. x. 47, to the effect that the animal is at once male and female, and that in combat the victor compels his antagonist to bear and bring forth offspring to him : cf. Phile (98), 1739. On an ancient Chinese version, cf. Kumagusu Minakatu in Nature, 1, p. 30, 1894.

sighted by day, the crow at midday preys upon the 10
owl’s eggs, and the owl at night upon the crow’s, each
having the whip-hand of the other, turn and turn about,
night and day.
There is enmity also between the owl and the wren ;1
for the latter also devours the owl’s eggs. In the daytime
all other little birds flutter round the owl—a practice which
is popularly termed ‘ admiring him ’2—buffet him, and
pluck out his feathers; in consequence of this habit, bird- x5
catchers use the owl as a decoy for catching little birds
of all kinds.
The so-called presbys or ‘ old man ’ 3 is at war with the
weasel and the crow, for they prey on her eggs and her
brood ; and so the turtle-dove with the pyrallis, for they
live in the same districts and on the same food; and so
with the green woodpecker and the libyus; and so with
the kite and the raven,4 for, owing to his having the 20
advantage from stronger talons and more rapid flight
the former can steal whatever the latter is holding, so that
it is food also that makes enemies of these. In like manner
there is war between birds that get their living from the
the chief tales of the Mahabharata ; cf. Ind. Antiquary, March, 1882, p. 87. Cf. also Ael. iii. 9, v. 48; Antig. Mirab. 57 (62); Pint. Od. et Inv. 4; Jul. Imp. Orat. iv. 149; Prov. ap.

and so between the buzzard on one side and the toad and
snake on the other, for the buzzard preys upon the eggs of
25 the two others ; and so between the turtle-dove and the
chloreus ; the chloreus kills the dove, and the crow kills
the so-called drummer-bird.2
The aegolius, and birds of prey in general, prey upon the
calaris, and consequently there is war between it and them;
and so is there war between the gecko-lizard and the
spider, for the former preys upon the latter ; and so between
30 the woodpecker and the heron, for the former preys upon
the eggs and brood of the latter.3 And so between the
aegithus and the ass, owing to the fact that the ass, in
passing a furze-bush, rubs its sore and itching parts against
the prickles ; by so doing, and all the more if it brays,
it topples the eggs and the brood out of the nest, the young
ones tumble out in fright, and the mother-bird, to avenge
this wrong, flies at the beast and pecks at his sore places.4

breaks the eagle’s eggs, so the eagle is at war with it on
special grounds, though, as a bird of prey, it carries on
a general war all round. The horse and the anthus are
enemies,1 and the horse will drive the bird out of the field 15
where he is grazing: the bird feeds on grass, and sees too
dimly to foresee an attack ; it mimics the whinnying of the
horse, flies at him, and tries to frighten him away; but the
horse drives the bird away, and whenever he catches it he
kills it: this bird lives beside rivers or on marsh ground ;
it has pretty plumage, and finds its food without trouble.
The ass is at enmity with the lizard, for the lizard sleeps in 20
his manger, gets into his nostril, and prevents his eating.
Of herons there are three kinds: the ash-coloured, the
white, and the starry heron (or bittern). Of these the first
mentioned submits with reluctance to the duties of incuba¬
tion, or to union of the sexes; in fact, it screams during
the union, and it is said drips blood from its eyes;2 it
lays its eggs also in an awkward manner, not unattended 25
with pain. It is at war with certain creatures that do it
injury: with the eagle for robbing it, with the fox for
worrying it at night, and with the lark for stealing its eggs.3
The snake is at war with the weasel and the pig; with
the weasel when they are both at home, for they live on
the same food ; with the pig for preying on her kind. The 30
merlin is at war with the fox ;4 it strikes and claws it, and,

as it has crooked talons, it kills the animal’s young. The
raven and the fox are good friends, for the raven is at
enmity with the merlin ; and so when the merlin assails
the fox the raven comes and helps the animal. The
vulture and the merlin are mutual enemies, as being both
furnished with crooked talons. The vulture fights with the
6ioa eagle, and so, by the way, does the swan ; and the swan is
often victorious: moreover, of all birds swans are most
prone to the killing of one another.1
In regard to wild creatures, some sets are at enmity with
other sets at all times and under all circumstances; others,
as in the case of man and man, at special times and under
incidental circumstances. The ass and the acanthis are
5 enemies ; for the bird lives on thistles, and the ass browses
on thistles when they are young and tender. The anthus,
the acanthis, and the aegithus are at enmity with one
another; it is said that the blood of the anthus will not
intercommingle with the blood of the aegithus.2 The crow
and the heron are friends, as also are the sedge-bird and
lark, the laedus and the celeus or green woodpecker ;3 the
woodpecker lives on the banks of rivers and beside brakes,
io the laedus lives on rocks and hills, and is greatly attached
to its nesting-place. The piphinx,4 * the harpe, and the kite
are friends ; as are the fox and the snake, for both burrow
underground ; so also are the blackbird and the turtle-dove/J
The lion and the thos or civet6 are enemies, for both are
carnivorous and live on the same food.
15 Elephants fight fiercely with one another, and stab one
another with their tusks; of two combatants the beaten
one gets completely cowed, and dreads the sound of his
conqueror’s voice. These animals differ from one another

to an extraordinary extent in the way of courage.1 Indians
employ these animals for war purposes, irrespective of sex ;
the females, however, are less in size and much inferior in 20
point of spirit.2 An elephant by pushing with his big
tusks can batter down a wall, and will butt with his forehead
at a palm until he brings it down, when he stamps on it
and lays it in orderly fashion on the ground.3 Men hunt
the elephant in the following way: they mount tame
elephants of approved spirit and proceed in quest of wild 25
animals ; when they come up with these they bid the tame
brutes to beat the wild ones until they tire the latter com¬
pletely. Hereupon the driver mounts a wild brute and
guides him with the application of his metal prong;4 after
this the creature soon becomes tame, and obeys guidance.
Now when the driver is on their back they are all tractable, 30
but after he has dismounted, some are tame and others
vicious ; in the case of these latter, they tie their front-legs
with ropes to keep them quiet. The animal is hunted
whether young or full grown.5
Thus we see that in the case of the creatures above
mentioned their mutual friendship or enmity is due to the
food they feed on and the life they lead.
Of fishes, such as swim in shoals together are friendly to 6iob
one another; such as do not so swim are enemies. Some
fishes swarm during the spawning season; others after
they have spawned. To state the matter comprehensively,
we may say that the following are shoaling fish: the tunny,
the maenis, the sea-gudgeon, the bogue,6 the horse-mackerel,7

sphyraena, the anthias, the eleginus,1 the atherine, the
sarginus, the gar-fish,2 [the squid,] the rainbow-wrasse,3
the pelamyd, the mackerel, the coly-mackerel. Of these
some not only swim in shoals, but go in pairs inside the
shoal; the rest without exception swim in pairs, and only
swim in shoals at certain periods: that is, as has been said,
when they are heavy with spawn or after they have
spawned.
The basse and the grey mullet are bitter enemies, but
they swarm together at certain times ; for at times not
only do fishes of the same species swarm together, but also
those whose feeding-grounds are identical or adjacent, if the
food-supply be abundant. The grey mullet is often found
alive with its tail lopped off, and the conger with all that
part of its body removed that lies to the rear of the vent;4
in the case of the mullet the injury is wrought by the
basse, in that of the conger-eel by the muraena.5 There
is war between the larger and the lesser fishes: for the big
fishes prey on the little ones. So much on the subject of
marine animals.
The characters of animals, as has been observed,6 differ 3
in respect to timidity, to gentleness, to courage, to tame¬
ness, to intelligence, and to stupidity.7
The sheep is said to be naturally dull and stupid.8 Of
all quadrupeds it is the most foolish : it will saunter away

taken by a snowstorm, it will stand still unless the
shepherd sets it in motion ; it will stay behind and perish
unless the shepherd brings up the rams ; it will then follow
home.
1 If you catch hold of a goats beard at the extremity
the beard is of a substance resembling hair—all the com- 30
panion goats will stand stock still, staring at this particular
goat in a kind of dumbfounderment.
You will have a warmer bed in amongst the goats than
among the sheep, because the goats will be quieter and
will creep up towards you ; for the goat is more impatient
of cold than the sheep.2
1 Read orav ns pias Xafip. This sentence is not a little obscure. The sense of the text is followed by Pliny, viii. 76 (50) ‘ Dependet omnium caprarum mento villus, quern aruncum vocant. Hoc si quis apprehensam ex grege unam trahat, ceterae stupentes spectant. Id etiam evenire, cum quandam herbam aliqua ex eis momorderit.’ Aruncus does not occur elsewhere in Latin (spirillum is given as a goat’s beard ap. Festus, p. 330, Mull.), and in Greek fjpvyyos or rjpvyyiov is elsewhere always the herb Goat’s-beard. The expression in the text, tern 8' olov 0pl£, would certainly seem to refer to the plant; other writers who tell the story tell it without exception of the herb, e. g. Antig. Mirak.

Salmas. de Homonym, p. 77 concludes that Aristotle was speaking of the plant, as does Beckmann in loc.

We may translate one way or the other, according as we read orav ns pias Xbj3p with Bekker, or pla ns with Salmasius, Beckmann, and Dittmeyer. The version of Guil. de Moerbeke, ‘ Caprarum autem cum unius cepit quis summitatem inflexionis tybiae, est autem velut palus,’ is interesting for Schneider’s most ingenious elucidation of it; after emending pilus for palus, Schn. shows that the reference to tibiae probably comes from a faulty gloss

Shepherds train sheep to close in together at a clap of
their hands, for if, when a thunderstorm comes on,1 a ewe
stays behind without closing in, the storm will kill it if it
6na be with young ; consequently if a sudden clap or noise is
made, they close in together within the sheepfold by reason
of their training.
Even bulls, when they are roaming by themselves apart
from the herd, are killed by wild animals/2
Sheep and goats lie crowded together, kin by kin. When
5 the sun turns early towards its setting, the goats are said to
lie no longer face to face, but back to back. j
Cattle at pasture keep together in their accustomed 4
herds, and if one animal strays away the rest will follow ;
consequently if the herdsmen lose one particular animal,
they keep close watch on all the rest.4

When mares with their colts pasture together in the
same field, if one dam dies the others will take up the io
rearing of the colt. In point of fact, the mare appears to
be singularly prone by nature to maternal fondness ; in
proof whereof a barren mare will steal the foal from its
dam, will tend it with all the solicitude of a mother, but,
as it will be unprovided with mother’s milk, its solicitude
will prove fatal to its charge.
5 Among wild quadrupeds the hind appears to be pre- 15
eminently intelligent; for example, in its habit of bringing
forth its young on the sides of public roads, where the fear
of man forbids the approach of wild animals.1 Again, after
parturition, it first swallows the afterbirth,2 then goes in
quest of the seseli shrub,3 and after eating of it returns to
its young. The mother takes its young betimes to her
lair, so leading it to know its place of refuge in time of 20
danger;4 this lair is a precipitous rock, with only one
approach, and there it is said to hold its own against all
comers. The male when it gets fat, which it does in
a high degree in autumn, disappears, abandoning its usual
resorts, apparently under an idea that its fatness facilitates
its capture.5 They shed their horns in places difficult of 25
access or discovery, whence the proverbial expression of
‘ the place where the stag sheds his horns ’; 6 the fact being

not to be seen. The saying is that no man has ever seen
the animal’s left horn ;1 that the creature keeps it out of
30 sight because it possesses some medicinal property.
In their first year stags grow no horns, but only an
excrescence indicating where horns will be, this excrescence
being short and thick. In their second year they grow
their horns for the first time, straight in shape, like pegs
for hanging clothes on ; and on this account they have an
appropriate nickname.2 In the third year the antlers are
bifurcate; in the fourth year they grow trifurcate;3 and so
they go on increasing in complexity until the creature is six
6nb years old :4 after this they grow their horns without any
specific differentiation, so that you cannot by observation
of them tell the animal’s age. But the patriarchs of the
herd may be told chiefly by two signs ; in the first place
they have few teeth or none at all, and, in the second
5 place, they have ceased to grow the pointed tips to their
antlers. The forward-pointing tips of the growing horns
(that is to say the brow-antlers), with which the animal
meets attack, are technically termed its ‘defenders’; with
these the patriarchs arc unprovided, and their antlers
merely grow straight upwards. Stags shed their horns an¬
nually, in or about the month of May ; after shedding, they
10 conceal themselves, it is said, during the daytime, and,
to avoid the flies,5 * hide in thick copses ; during this time,
until they have grown their horns, they feed at night¬
time. The horns at first grow in a kind of skin envelope,

They all also use the expression defodere or Karopinreiv, which latter word Schn. would therefore substitute in the text for airoKpimTav. Cf. also Ael. iv. 5. On the hart’s horn and its virtues cf.

the animal basks in the sun, to mature and dry them. 15
When they need no longer rub them against tree-trunks
they quit their hiding-places, from a sense of security
based upon the possession of arms defensive and offensive.
An Achaeine stag has been caught with a quantity of
green ivy grown over its horns,2 it having grown appar¬
ently, as on fresh green wood, when the horns were young 20
and tender. When a stag is stung by a venom-spider or
similar insect, it gathers crabs and eats them ;3 it is said to
be a good thing for man to drink the juice, but the taste is
disagreeable. The hinds after parturition at once swallow
the afterbirth, and it is impossible to secure it, for the
hind catches it before it falls to the ground: now this 25
substance is supposed to have medicinal properties. When
hunted the creatures are caught by singing or pipe-playing
on the part of the hunters ; they are so pleased with the
music that they lie down on the grass.4 If there be two

5 property of ejecting arrows in the body.4 Dogs, when they
are ill, eat some kind of grass and produce vomiting.5
The panther, after eating panther's-bane, tries to find some
human excrement, which is said to heal its pain.6 This
panther’s-bane kills lions as well. Hunters hang up human
10 excrement in a vessel attached to the boughs of a tree,
to keep the animal from straying to any distance; the
animal meets its end in leaping up to the branch and
trying to get at the medicine. They say that the panther
has found out that wild animals are fond of the scent it
emits;7 that, when it goes a-hunting, it hides itself; that
the other animals come nearer and nearer, and that by this
15 stratagem it can catch even animals as swift of foot as
stags.

first soaking in the river and then rolling on the ground.1
When the crocodile yawns, the trochilus2 flies into his 20
mouth and cleans his teeth. The trochilus gets his food
thereby, and the crocodile gets ease and comfort; it makes
no attempt to injure its little friend, but, when it wants
it to go, it shakes its neck" in warning, lest it should
accidentally bite the bird.
The tortoise, when it has partaken of a snake, eats
marjoram ; this action has been actually observed.4 A man 25
saw a tortoise perform this operation over and over again,
and every time it plucked up some marjoram go back
to partake of its prey; he thereupon pulled the marjoram
up by the roots, and the consequence was the tortoise died.
The weasel, when it fights with a snake, first eats5 wild
rue, the smell of which is noxious to the snake.6 The
dragon, when it eats fruit, swallows endive-juice;7 it has 30

eat the standing corn.8 Storks, and all other birds, when
they get a wound fighting, apply marjoram to the place
injured.9

Many have seen the locust, when fighting with the snake
get a tight hold of the snake by the neck.1 The weasel
6i2b has a clever way of getting the better of birds; it tears
their throats open, as wolves do with sheep. Weasels fight
desperately with mice-catching snakes, as they both prey
on the same animal.2
In regard to the instinct of hedgehogs, it has been
5 observed in many places that, when the wind is shifting
from north to south, and from south to north, they shift
the outlook of their earth-holes, and those that are kept in
domestication shift over from one wall to the other.3 The
story goes that a man in Byzantium got into high repute
for foretelling a change of weather, all owing to his having
noticed this habit of the hedgehog.
10 The polecat or marten4 is about as large as the smaller
breed of Maltese dogs.5 * In the thickness of its fur,
in its look, in the white of its belly, and in its love of
mischief, it resembles the weasel; it is easily tamed; from
its liking for honey it is a plague to bee-hives ; it preys on

birds like the cat. Its genital organ, as has been said, 15
consists of bone :1 2 3 the organ of the male is supposed to be
a cure for strangury; doctors scrape it into powder, and
administer it in that form.
In a general way in the lives of animals many resem¬
blances to human life may be observed. Pre-eminent
intelligence will be seen more in small creatures than in 20
large ones, as is exemplified in the case of birds by the
nest-building of the swallow.- In the same way as men
do,:j the bird mixes mud and chaff4 together; if it runs short
of mud, it souses its body in water and rolls about in the
dry dust with wet feathers; furthermore, just as man does, 25
it makes a bed of straw, putting hard material below for
a foundation, and adapting all to suit its own size. Both
parents co-operate in the rearing of the young; each of
the parents will detect, with practised eye, the young one
that has had a helping, and will take care it is not helped
twice over;5 at first the parents will rid the nest of excre¬
ment, but, when the young are grown, they will teach their 30
young to shift their position and let their excrement fall
over the side of the nest.6
Pigeons exhibit other phenomena with a similar likeness
to the ways of humankind. In pairing the same male and
the same female keep together; and the union is only
broken by the death of one of the two parties.7 At the
time of parturition in the female the sympathetic attentions

of the male are extraordinary ; if the female is afraid on
account of the impending parturition to enter the nest, the
male will beat her and force her to come in. When the
young are born, he will take and masticate pieces of
suitable food,1 will open the beaks of the fledglings, and
inject these pieces, thus preparing them betimes to take
5 food. [When the male bird is about to expel the young
ones from the nest, he cohabits with them all.2 3] As a
general rule these birds show this conjugal fidelity, but
occasionally a female will cohabit with other than her mate.:J
These birds are combative, and quarrel with one another,
and enter each other’s nests, though this occurs but seldom ;
io at a distance from their nests this quarrelsomeness is less
marked, but in the close neighbourhood of their nests they
will fight desperately. A peculiarity common to the tame
pigeon, the ring-dove and the turtle-dove is that they do
not lean the head back when they are in the act of drink¬
ing,4 but only when they have fully quenched their thirst.
The turtle-dove and the ring-dove both have but one mate,
15 and let no other come nigh; both sexes co-operate in the
process of incubation. It is difficult to distinguish between
the sexes except by an examination of their interiors.
Ring-doves are long-lived ; cases have been known where
such birds were twenty-five years old, thirty years old, and
in some cases forty.5 As they grow old their claws increase
20 in size, and pigeon-fanciers cut the claws ; as far as one can
see, the birds suffer no other perceptible disfigurement
by their increase in age. Turtle-doves and pigeons that

are blinded by fanciers for use as decoys, live for eight
years. Partridges live for about fifteen years. Ring-doves
and turtle-doves always build their nests in the same 25
place year after year. The male, as a general rule, is more
long-lived than the female ; but in the case of pigeons some
assert that the male dies before the female, taking their
inference from the statements of persons who keep decoy
birds in captivity. Some declare that the male sparrow
lives only for a year, pointing to the fact that early in 3°
spring the male sparrow has no black beard, but has one
later on, as though the black-bearded birds of the last year
had all died out; they also say that the females are the
longer lived, on the grounds that they are caught in
amongst the young birds and that their age is rendered 6i3b
manifest by the hardness about their beaks. Turtle-doves
in summer live in cold places, (and in warm places during
the winter) ;1 chaffinches affect warm habitations in summer, 5
and cold ones in winter.
8 Birds of a heavy build, such as quails, partridges, and the
like, build no nests ;2 indeed, where they are incapable of
flight, it would be of no use if they could do so. After
scraping a hole on a level piece of ground—and it is only
in such a place that they lay their eggs—they cover it over
with thorns and sticks3 for security against hawks and 10
eagles, and there lay their eggs and hatch them ; after the
hatching is over,4 they at once lead the young out from
the nest, as they are not able to fly afield for food for
them. Quails and partridges, like barn-door hens, when
they go to rest, gather their brood under their wings. Not 15
to be discovered, as might be the case if they stayed long
in one spot, they do not hatch the eggs where they laid

them.1 When a man comes by chance upon a young
brood, and tries to catch them, the hen-bird rolls in front
of the hunter, pretending to be lame:2 the man every
moment thinks he is on the point of catching her, and so
20 she draws him on and on, until every one of her brood
has had time to escape; hereupon she returns to the nest
and calls the young back. The partridge lays not less
than ten eggs, and often lays as many as sixteen. As has
been observed, the bird has mischievous and deceitful
habits. In the spring-time, a noisy 17 scrimmage takes place,
25 out of which the male-birds -emerge each with a hen.
Owing to the lecherous nature of the bird, and from
a dislike to the hen sitting, the males, if they find any
eggs, roll them over and over until they break them in
pieces ; to provide against this the female goes to a distance
and lays the eggs, and often, under the stress of parturition,
lays them in any chance spot that offers;4 if the male bird
30 be near at hand,5 then to keep the eggs intact she refrains
from visiting them. If she be seen by a man, then, just as with
her fledged brood, she entices him off by showing herself
close at his feet until she has drawn him to a distance. When
the females have run away and taken to sitting, the males
6i4a in a pack take to screaming and fighting; when thus engaged,
they have the nickname of ‘widowers ’.G The bird who is
beaten follows his victor, and submits to be covered by him
only ; and the beaten bird is covered by a second one or by
any other, only clandestinely without the victor’s knowledge;
this is so, not at all times, but at a particular season of the
5 year, and with quails as well as with partridges.7 A similar
1 Cf. Plin. l.c. Alb. M. gives a loose, but possibly correct inter¬ pretation: ‘Non habet nidurn certum et stabilem per annos multos, sicut gallina, sed uno anno ovant in loco uno et in alio loco in alio, et hoc ideo faciunt ne venator cognoscat nidum eius.’ The same story is told of (f)u(raa, Eust.

proceeding takes place occasionally with barn-door cocks :
for in temples, where cocks are set apart as dedicate
without hens,1 they all as a matter of course tread any
new-comer. Tame partridges tread wild birds, peck at
their heads,2 and treat them with every possible outrage.
The leader of the wild birds, with a counter-note of 10
challenge,3 pushes forward to attack the decoy-bird,4 and
after he has been netted,5 another advances with a similar
note.6 This is what is done if the decoy be a male; but
*
if it be a female that is the decoy and gives the note, and
the leader of the wild birds give a counter one, the rest of
the males set upon him and chase him away from the 15
female for making advances to her instead of to them ;
in consequence of this the male often advances without
uttering any cry, so that no other may hear him and come
and give him battle ; and experienced fowlers assert that
sometimes the male bird, when he approaches the female,
makes her keep silence, to avoid having to give battle to 20
other males who might have heard him. The partridge
has not only the note here referred to, but also a thin
shrill cry and other notes.” Oftentimes the hen-bird rises
from off her brood when she sees the male showing atten¬
tions to the female decoy ; she will give the counter-note
and remain still, so as to be trodden by him and divert him 25
from the decoy. The quail and the partridge are so intent
upon sexual union that they often come right in the way

of the decoy-birds, and not seldom alight upon then
heads.1 So much for the sexual proclivities of the par
* tridge, for the way in which it is hunted, and the general
30 nasty habits of the bird.
As has been said, quails and partridges build their nests
upon the ground, and so also do some of the birds that are
capable of sustained flight.2 Further, for instance, of such
birds, the lark and the woodcock, as well as the quail, do
not perch on a branch, but squat upon the ground.
6i4b The woodpecker does not squat on the ground, but 9
pecks at the bark of trees to drive out from under it
maggots and gnats;3 when they emerge, it licks them up
with its tongue, which is large and flat.4 It can run up and
down a tree in any way, even with the head downwards,
like the gecko-lizard.5 For secure hold upon a tree, its
5 claws are better adapted than those of the daw ;G it makes
its way by sticking these claws into the bark. One species
of woodpecker 7 is smaller than a blackbird, and has small
reddish speckles; a second species is larger than the black¬
bird, and a third is not much smaller than a barn-door
10 hen.8 It builds a nest on trees,9 as has been said, on
olive trees amongst others. It feeds on the maggots and
ants that are under the bark: it is so eager in the search
for maggots that it is said sometimes to hollow a tree out
to its downfall. A woodpecker once, in course of domesti
15 cation, was seen to insert an almond into a hole in a piece
of timber, so that it might remain steady under its

pecking; at the third peck it split the shell of the fruit,
and then ate the kernel.
10 Many indications of high intelligence are given by
cranes. They will fly to a great distance and high up
in the air, to command an extensive view; if they see 20
clouds and signs of bad weather they fly down again and
remain still.1 They, furthermore, have a leader in their
flight, and patrols that scream on the confines of the
flock so as to be heard by all. When they settle down,
the main body go to sleep with their heads under their
wing, standing first on one leg and then on the other, 25
while their leader, with his head uncovered, keeps a sharp
look out, and when he sees anything of importance signals
it with a cry.
Pelicans that live beside rivers2 swallow the large smooth
mussel-shells : after cooking them inside the crop that pre¬
cedes the stomach, they spit them out, so that, now when
their shells are open, they may pick the flesh out and
eat it.3 3°
11 Of wild birds, the nests are fashioned to meet the exigencies
of existence and ensure the security of the young. Some
of these birds are fond of their young and take great care
of them, others are quite the reverse ; some are clever in
procuring subsistence, others are not so. Some of these
birds build in ravines and clefts,4 and on cliffs, as, for
instance, the so-called charadrius, or stone-curlew ; this bird 6i5a
is in no way noteworthy for plumage or voice ; it makes an
appearance at night, but in the daytime keeps out of sight.
The hawk also builds in inaccessible places. Although
a ravenous bird, it will never eat the heart of any bird it
catches ;5 this has been observed in the case of the quail, 5

Of the vulture, it is said that no one ha^ ever seen either its
young or its nest;:i on this account and on the ground that
all of a sudden great numbers of them will appear without
any one being able to tell from whence they come, Hero
10 dorus, the father of Bryson the sophist, says that it belongs
to some distant and elevated 4 land. The reason is that the
bird has its nest on inaccessible crags, and is found only
in a few localities. The female lays one egg as a rule,
and two at the most.
15 Some birds live on mountains or in forests, as the
hoopoe and the brenthus;5 this latter bird finds his food
with ease and has a musical voice. The wren lives in
brakes and crevices; it is difficult of capture, keeps out of
sight, is gentle of disposition, finds its food with ease, and
is something of a mechanic. It goes by the nickname of
‘ old man ’ or ‘ king5;6 and the story goes that for this
reason the eagle is at war with him.7
20 Some birds live on the sea-shore, as the wagtail ; the 12
bird is of a mischievous nature, hard to capture, but when
1 /iera/3«XXetj/ is often used of the hawk, but always of its supposed metamorphosis with the cuckoo. The expression here is a singular one, and from the analogy of H. A. vi. 7. 563b 24 we might suspect the true reading to be peril to Oepos. 2 Albertus M. ‘aliam praedam capiunt in aestate et aliam in hieme ’. 3 That the vulture laid no eggs, but was impregnated by the east wind and brought forth her young alive and feathered, was an Egyp¬ tian myth, connected with the association of the bird with Maut, the goddess of maternity. For reff. see GI. of Gk. Birds, p. 48. The rest of the paragraph is an inaccurate transcript of H. A. vi. 5. 56311 6. 4 erepas perdopov yrjs. A very suspicious phrase, especially inasmuch as what seems to be the parent passage (vi. 5) has simply d<pi irepas yrjs. I should be inclined to conjecture peroacov, and perhaps to compare Aesch. Ag. 575 (BpevOof. Hesvch. KO(r<rv(f)OT. Cf. II. A. ix. 1. 6o9a 23, where I suspect (Bp. to be an interpolation. 0 In my Gl. of Gk. Birds (pp. 126, 171) I have hazarded the conjecture that rpo^iXos is Egyptian, and further that in the likeness between Copt, oura, avis, and ouro, rex, may lie the connexion between the bird and its appellation ‘king’. 7 Cf. Plin. x. 95. It is to the owl that 0p^iXos is said to be hostile, If. A. ix. 1. 6o9a 12.

caught capable of complete domestication ; it is a cripple,
as being weak in its hinder quarters.1
Web-footed birds without exception live near the sea
or rivers or pools, as they naturally resort to places 25
adapted to their structure.2 Several birds, however, with
cloven toes live near pools or marshes, as, for instance, the
anthus3 lives by the side of rivers ; the plumage of this
bird is pretty, and it finds its food with ease. The
catarrhactes 4 lives near the sea ; when it makes a dive, it
will keep under water for as long as it would take a man 30
to walk a furlong; it is less than the common hawk.
Swans are web-footed, and live near pools and marshes ;
they find their food with ease, are good-tempered, are fond
of their young,5 and live to a green old age. If the eagle
attacks them they will repel the attack and get the better 6i5b
of their assailant, but they are never the first to attack.0
They are musical, and sing chiefly at the approach of
death ;7 at this time they fly out to sea, and men, when
sailing past the coast of Libya, have fallen in with many
of them out at sea singing in mournful strains, and have 5
actually seen some of them dying.8
The cymindis9 is seldom seen, as it lives on mountains ;
it is black in colour, and about the size of the hawk called
the ‘ dove-killer ’; it is long and slender 10 in form. The

 HISTORIA ANIMALIUM
Ionians call the bird by this name ; Homer in the Iliad
mentions it in the line 1 :
Chalcis its name with those of heav’nly birth,
Rut called Cymindis by the sons of earth.
The hybris, said by some to be the same as the eagle
owl, is never seen by daylight, as it is dim-sighted, but
during the night it hunts like the eagle ;2 it will fight the
eagle 2 with such desperation that the two combatants are
often captured alive by shepherds ; it lays two eggs, and,
like others we have mentioned, it builds on rocks and in
caverns. Cranes also fight so desperately among them¬
selves as to be caught when fighting, for they will not leave
off;3 the crane lays two eggs.
The jay has a great variety of notes: indeed, one might 13
almost say it had a different note for every day in the
year.4 It lays about nine eggs; builds its nest on trees,
out of hair and tags of wool; when acorns are getting
scarce,5 6 it lays up a store of them in hiding.
It is a common story of the stork that the old birds are
fed by their grateful progeny.0 Some tell a similar story
of the bee-eater, and declare that the parents are fed by
their young not only when growing old, but at an early
period, as soon as the young are capable of feeding them ;
and the parent-birds stay inside the nest.' The under part
of the bird’s wing is pale yellow; the upper part is dark

blue, like that of the halcyon ; the tips of the wings are
red.1 About autumn-time2 it lays six or seven eggs, in 30
overhanging banks where the soil is soft; there it burrows
into the ground to a depth of six feet.
The greenfinch, so called from the colour of its belly,
is as large as a lark ; it lays four or five eggs, builds
its nest out of the plant called comfrey, pulling it up 6i6a
by the roots, and makes an under-mattress to lie on of hair
and wool.3 The blackbird and the jay build their nests after
the same fashion. The nest of the penduline tit shows
great mechanical skill; it has the appearance of a ball of 5
flax, and the hole for entry is very small.4
People who live where the bird comes from say that
there exists a cinnamon bird which brings the cinnamon
from some unknown localities, and builds its nest out of it;5
it builds on high trees on the slender top branches. They 10
say that the inhabitants attach leaden weights to the tips
of their arrows and therewith bring down the nests, and
from the intertexture collect the cinnamon sticks.
The halcyon is not much larger than the sparrow. Its
colour is dark blue, green, and light purple; the whole 15
body and wings, and especially parts about the neck, show
these colours in a mixed way, without any colour being
sharply defined ; the beak is light green, long and slender:6
such, then, is the look of the bird. Its nest7 is like sea

The nest of the kingfisher is a deep excavation, widening within, in a river-bank, and more or less filled with fish¬ bones, the debris of food.

20 balls, i. e. the things that go by the name of halosachne1
or sea-foam, only the colour is not the same. The colour
of the nest is light red, and the shape is that of the long¬
necked gourd. The nests are larger than the largest
sponge, though they vary in size ; they are roofed over,
25 and great part of them is solid and great part hollow.2 If
you use a sharp knife it is not easy to cut the rest through ;
but if you cut it, and at the same time bruise it with your
hand, it will soon crumble to pieces, like the halosachne.
The opening is small, just enough for a tiny entrance,3
so that even if the nest upset4 the sea does not enter in ;
30 the hollow channels are like those in sponges. It is not
known for certain of what material the nest is constructed;
it is possibly made of the backbones of the gar-fish ;5 for,
by the way, the bird lives on fish. Besides living on the
similar nest of plpo\j/); nor is it easy to say whether we are dealing with a connected account of some object totally different, or with a corrupt passage, of which isolated phrases agree fairly well with the true character of the nest. The account in Aelian is similar, but wholly fabulous. That there was some religious mystery associated with the so-called nest is indicated by the conclusion of Plutarch’s description, Soil.

shore, it ascends fresh-water streams. It lays generally
about five eggs, and lays eggs1 all its life long, beginning
to do so at the age of four months.
15 The hoopoe usually constructs its nest out of human
excrement.2 It changes its appearance3 in summer and 6i6b
in winter, as in fact do the great majority of wild birds.
(The titmouse is said to lay a very large quantity of eggs:
next to the ostrich the blackheaded tit is said by some to
lay the largest number of eggs ; seventeen eggs have been 5
seen; it lays, however, more than twenty ; it is said always
to lay an odd number. Like others we have mentioned,
it builds in trees ; it feeds on caterpillars.) A peculiarity of
this bird and of the nightingale is that the outer extremity
of the tongue is not sharp-pointed.4
The aegithus 5 finds its food with ease, has many young, 10
and walks with a limp. The golden oriole6 is apt at
learning, is clever at making a living, but is awkward in
flight and has an ugly plumage.
16 The reed-warbler makes its living as easily as any other
bird, sits in summer in a shady spot facing the wind, in
winter in a sunny and sheltered 7 place among reeds in a 15
marsh; it is small in size, with a pleasant note. The

Arch, f Naturgeschichte, i, p. n, 1852, &c.): from this cause, and from the bird’s seeking its food amidst dung (‘avis obsceno pastu’, Plin. x. 44), the hoopoe receives various characteristic epithets in countries where it abounds, e. g.

so-called chatterer has a pleasant note, beautiful plumage,
makes a living cleverly, and is graceful in form ; it appears
to be alien to our country; at all events it is seldom seen
at a distance from its own immediate home.
20 The crake 1 is quarrelsome, clever at making a living, but V]
in other ways an unlucky bird.2 The bird called sitta is
quarrelsome, but clever and tidy, makes its living with
ease, and for its knowingness is regarded as uncanny ;
it has a numerous brood, of which it is fond, and lives by
25 pecking the bark of trees. The aegolius-owl flies by night,
is seldom seen by day; like others we have mentioned,
it lives on cliffs or in caverns ; it feeds on two kinds of
food ;3 it has a strong hold on life and is full of resource.
The tree-creeper is a little bird, of fearless disposition; it
lives among trees, feeds on caterpillars, makes a living with
30 ease, and has a loud clear note. The acanthis finds its
food with difficulty; its plumage is poor, but its note is
musical.
Of the herons, the ashen-coloured one, as has been said, 18
unites with the female not without pain ;4 it is full of
resource, carries its food with it, is eager in the quest of it,5
and works by day ; its plumage is poor, and its excrement
6i7a is always wet. Of the other two species—for there are
three in all—the white heron has handsome plumage, unites

without harm to itself1 with the female, builds a nest and
lays its eggs neatly2 in trees ; it frequents marshes and
lakes and plains and meadow land. The speckled heron, 5
which is nicknamed ‘ the skulker ’, is said in folklore stories
to be of servile origin, and, as its nickname implies, it is the
laziest bird of the three species.3 Such are the habits
of herons. The bird that is called the poynx4 has this
peculiarity, that it is more prone than any other bird to
peck at the eyes of an assailant or its prey; it is at war 10
with the harpy, as the two birds live on the same food.
19 There are two kinds of owsels; the one is black, and
is found everywhere, the other is quite white,5 about the
same size as the other, and with the same pipe. This latter
is found on Cyllene in Arcadia, and is found nowhere
else. The laius,0 or blue-thrush, is like the black owsel, 15
only a little smaller; it lives on cliffs or on tile roofings;
it has not a red beak as the black owsel has.
Of thrushes there are three species.7 One is the missel
thrush ; it feeds only on mistletoe and resin ; it is about

In Aristotle the accounts of 7re\Xo9 and nareplas are corrupt and fabulous, and the same two names occur conjoined as proper names in Apoll. Rh. i. 176. The usual identification with the common heron and the bittern has a very slender basis in the supposed colour-significance of the names. 4 <ficovg. The glosses of Hesych., Suid. and El. M. are unsatisfactory. The word is quite as likely to be a foreign word for heron as it is to be a more specific designation. 5 Cf. Anton.Lib.5; Ael.ii.47; Plin.x.45 ; Pausan.viii. 17.3; Sostrat.^. Ael. v. 27; Ps.-Arist. de Mirab. 15. 831^ 14, &c. The story of the white blackbirds on Cyllene is widespread. Some authors state that all the blackbirds on Cyllene are white, and some that the white are not found elsewhere. Lindermeyer ( Vogel Griechenlands, 1860, p. 86), mentioning a white blackbird shot near Athens, repeats the statement of their common occurrence on Cyllene. While white blackbirds occur occa¬ sionally everywhere, the permanent existence of a white race in a particular locality would be a remarkable and unparalleled occurrence. I am inclined to discredit the whole story, and to suspect an old blunder, dialectic misunderstanding, or play of words on the XevKas Knpv(f)ds of the mountain. c X«io9.

20 the size of the jay. A second kind is the song-thrush;
it has a sharp pipe, and is about the size of the owsel.
There is another species called the I lias;1 it is the smallest
species of the three, and is less variegated in plumage than
the others.
There is a bird that lives on rocks, called the blue-bird 21
from its colour.2 It is comparatively common in Nisyros,3
25 and is somewhat less than the owsel and a little bigger
than the chaffinch. It has large claws,4 and climbs on the
face of the rocks. It is steel-blue all over; its beak is
long and slender; its legs are short, like those of the
woodpecker.
The oriole5 6 is yellow all over; it is not visible during 22
winter, but puts in an appearance about the time of the
30 summer solstice, and departs again at the rising of Arcturus;
it is the size of the turtle-dove. The so-called soft-head
(or shrike) always settles on one and the same branch,
6i7b where it falls a prey to the bird-catcher. Its head is big,
and composed of gristle; it is a little smaller than the
thrush ; its beak is strong, small, and round ; it is ashen
coloured all over ; is fleet of foot, but slow of wing. The
5 bird-catcher usually catches it by help of the owl.'1
There is also the pardalus. As a rule, it is seen in flocks 23
and not singly; it is ashen-coloured all over, and about the
size of the birds last described ; it is fleet of foot and strong
of wing, and its pipe is loud and high-pitched. The collyrion
10 (or fieldfare) feeds on the same food as the owsel; is of
the same size as the above-mentioned birds ; and is trapped
usually in the winter. All these birds are found at all
1 i’XX(if or tXiay may possibly = t^Xn9 and be akin to ki^X^, the modi¬ fications of which word are many. 2 The description of this little bird is unusually detailed. Save for kvqvovs oXos, which describes inadequately its brilliant colouring, the description agrees with the scarce and local wall-creeper, Tichodroma muraria. So Sundevall; but other commentators say the Blue-thrush, cf. \ai6i. Nio-vpci), vulg. 2icvpa>, cf. Ael. iv. 59. Cf. Strabo, xiv. 2. 15. 4 p.(yci\o7Tovs. Alb.

times.1 Further, there are the birds that live as a rule
in towns, the raven and the crow. These also are visible
at all seasons, never shift their place of abode, and never
go into winter quarters.
24 Of daws there are three species. One is the chough ;
it is as large as the crow, but has a red beak. There is
another, called the ‘ wolf’;2 and further there is the little
daw, called the ‘ railer \ There is another kind of daw
found in Lydia and Phrygia, which is web-footed.3
25 Of larks there are two kinds. One lives on the ground
and has a crest on its head;4 the other is gregarious, and
not sporadic like the first ; it is, however, of the same
coloured plumage, but is smaller, and has no crest ; it is an
article of human food.
26 The woodcock is caught with nets in gardens. It is
about the size of a barn-door hen ; it has a long beak, and
in plumage is like the francolin-partridge. It runs quickly,
and is pretty easily domesticated. The starling is speckled;
it is of the same size as the owsel.
27 Of the Egyptian ibis there are two kinds, the white and
the black.5 The white ones are found all over Egypt,
excepting in Pelusium; the black ones are found in
Pelusium, and nowhere else in Egypt.

visible at all seasons, and for that reason has the nickname
ofc all-the-year-round owl ’; it is not sufficiently palatable
6i8a to come to table; another species makes its appearance
sometimes in the autumn, is seen for a single day or at
the most for two days, and is regarded as a table delicacy;
it scarcely differs from the first species save only in being
5 fatter; it has no note, but the other species has. With
regard to their origin, nothing is known from ocular
observation; the only fact known for certain is that they
are first seen when a west wind is blowing.
The cuckoo,1 as has been said elsewhere, makes no nest, 29
but deposits its eggs in an alien nest, generally in the
10 nest of the ring-dove, or on the ground in the nest of the
hypolais2 or lark, or on a tree in the nest of the green
and those pass through Greece that breed in Hungary and Geimany (Kriiper, p. 181). The Aristotelian account is not very clear: the birds of passage differ from the residents in more than their fatness, viz. in being mute instead of vocal; this (in spite of a lack of reference to the visible distinction of the ear-tufts) would lead one to suppose that the adatomes were really yXavKts, whose cry (which the modern Greek name KovKov&atn resembles) is persistent and characteristic, and I am not sure but what this is actually asserted by Callimachus (a/>. Athen. /. o), from whom the Aristotelian passage is borrowed : K. 8e (f>r]ai 8vo yevr) dvm aKatncov, kiu tovs /j.ev (fiOeyyeadcu, tovs 8e ov* 816 Knl KcikdaQcn

A. vi. 7. 56315 14. 2 ev vtto\(il8os. This bird is frequently quoted as one of those in whose nest the cuckoo lays her egg, but in no other connexion whatsoever: cf. H. A. vi. 7. 564a 2, Antig. Mirab. ico (109), Theophr. C. PI. ii. 17. 9. In a corresponding passage in Ael. iii. 30, its place is taken by minnos. The meaning of both alike is quite unknown. Sundevall’s conjecture of the wheatear, which makes its nest under a stone, has no more grounds than the apparent connexion with 'hdas, which is more than doubtful. That the cuckoo lays in the nest of or <1 riTTa (or rramros), as stated in all the above passages (cf. also Ps.Arist. de Mirab. 3. 830b 11, Plin. x. 11), is inexplicable. We may grope for a solution by supposing a confusion between (v)TroXais and ntXads: or that the statement is of foreign origin and referred originally to some Oriental species ; or that it is connected with eastern myths, such as are still current in China, where the dove and cuckoo are often confused, and the former is said to metamorphose into the hawk and to lay in the magpie’s nest (cf. T. Watters, Chinese Notions about Pigeons and Doves, Tr. N. China Dr., P. Asiat. Soc., iv. pp. 225-42. 1867). The orphean warbler is the bird in whose nest the cuckoo in Greece oftenest lays her egg, and this or an allied species is the Lat. curruca (cf. Juv. Sat. vi. 275 and Schol.).


 BOOK XI. 29 6i8a
linnet. It lays only one egg1 and does not batch it itself, but
the mother-bird in whose nest it has deposited it hatches
and rears it; and, as they say, this mother bird, when the
young cuckoo has grown big, thrusts her own brood out
of the nest and lets them perish; others say that this
mother-bird kills her own brood and gives them to the
alien to devour, despising her own young owing to the
beauty of the cuckoo.2 Personal observers agree in telling
most of these stories, but are not in agreement as to the
destruction of the young. Some say that the mother
cuckoo comes and devours the brood of the rearing mother;
others say that the young cuckoo from its superior size
snaps up the food brought before the smaller brood have
a chance, and that in consequence the smaller brood die
of hunger; others say that, by its superior strength, it
actually kills the other ones whilst it is being reared up
with them. The cuckoo shows great sagacity in the dis¬
posal of its progeny; the fact is, the mother-cuckoo is
quite conscious of her own cowardice and of the fact that
she could never help her young one in an emergency, and
so, for the security of the young one, she makes of him
a supposititious child in an alien nest. The truth is, this
bird is pre-eminent among birds in the way of cowardice;
it allows itself to be pecked at by little birds, and flies
away from their attacks.
V
30 It has already been stated that the footless bird, which
some term the cypselus,3 resembles the swallow ; indeed,
it is not easy to distinguish between the two birds, excepting
in the fact that the cypselus has feathers on the shank.
These birds rear their young in long4 cells made of mud,
and furnished with a hole just big enough for entry and

exit; they build under cover of some roofing—under a
rock or in a cavern—for protection against animals and men.
The so-called goat-sucker lives on mountains; it is
a little larger than the owsel, and less than the cuckoo;
it lays two eggs, or three at the most, and is of a sluggish
5 disposition. It flies up to the she-goat and sucks its milk,
from which habit it derives its name ; it is said that, after
it has sucked the teat of the animal, the teat dries up and
the animal goes blind.1 It is dim-sighted in the day-time,
but secs well enough by night.
In narrow circumscribed districts where the food would 31
o be insufficient for more birds than two, ravens are only
found in isolated pairs ;2 when their young are old enough
to fly, the parent couple first eject them from the nest,
and by and by chase them from the neighbourhood. The
raven lays four or five eggs. About the time when the
mercenaries under Medius3 were slaughtered at Pharsalus,
5 the districts about Athens and the Peloponnese were left
destitute of ravens, from which it would appear that these
birds have some means of intercommunicating with one
another.4
Of eagles there are several species.5 6 One of them, called 32
‘ the white-tailed G eagle’, is found on low lands, in groves,
o and in the neighbourhood of cities ; some call it the ‘ heron

killer It is bold enough to fly to mountains and the
interior of forests. The other eagles seldom visit groves
or low-lying lands. There is another species called the
‘ plangus ’ ; it ranks second in point of size and strength ;
it lives in mountain combes and glens, and by marshy
lakes, and goes by the name of ‘ duck-killer ’ and ‘ swart- 25
eagle \1 It is mentioned by Homer 2 in his account of the
visit made by Priam to the tent of Achilles. There is
another species with black plumage, the smallest but
boldest of all the kinds. It dwells on mountains or in
forests, and is called ‘the black-eagle’ or ‘the hare-killer’; it
is the only eagle that rears its young thoroughly and takes
them out with it. It is swift of flight, is neat and tidy 30
in its habits, too proud for jealousy, fearless, quarrelsome ;
it is also silent, for it neither whimpers nor screams. There
is another species, the percnopterus, very large, with white
head, very short wings, long tail-feathers, in appearance
like a vulture. It goes by the name of ‘ mountain-stork ’
or ‘ half-eagle ’.3 It lives in groves ; has all the bad quali¬
ties of the other species, and none of the good ones ; for it
lets itself be chased and caught by the raven and the other 6iga
birds. It is clumsy in its movements, has difficulty in
procuring its food, preys on dead animals, is always
hungry, and at all times whining and screaming. There
is another species, called the ‘ sea-eagle ’ or ‘ osprey ’. This
bird has a large thick neck, curved wings, and broad tail- 5
feathers ; it lives near the sea, grasps its prey with its
talons, and often, from inability to carry it, tumbles down
into the water. There is another species called the ‘ true
bred ’;4 people say that these are the only true-bred
birds to be found, that all other birds—eagles, hawks, and
the smallest birds—are all spoilt by the interbreeding of 10
different species. The true-bred eagle is the largest of all
eagles ; it is larger than the phene ; is half as large again

as the ordinary eagle, and has yellow plumage ;1 it is
seldom seen, as is the case with the so-called cymindis.
The time for an eagle to be on the wing in search of prey
15 is from midday to evening; in the morning until the
market-hour 2 it remains on the nest. In old age the upper
beak of the eagle grows gradually longer and more crooked,
and the bird dies eventually of starvation;3 there is a folk¬
lore story that the eagle is thus punished because it once
20 was a man and refused entertainment to a stranger. The
eagle puts aside its superfluous food for its young ; for
owing to the difficulty in procuring food day by day, it at
times may come back to the nest with nothing. If it catch
a man prowling about4 in the neighbourhood of its nest, it
will strike him with its wings and scratch him with its talons.5
25 The nest is built not on low ground but on an elevated spot,
generally on an inaccessible ledge of a cliff; it does, how¬
ever, build upon a tree. The young are fed until they can
fly ; hereupon the parent-birds topple them out of the nest,
and chase them completely out of the locality. The fact is
that a pair of eagles demands an extensive space for its
30 maintenance, and consequently cannot allow other birds
to quarter themselves in close neighbourhood.0 They do
not hunt in the vicinity of their nest, but go to a great
distance to find their prey. When the eagle has captured
a beast, it puts it down 7 without attempting to carry it off
at once ; if on trial it finds the burden too heavy, it will
leave it. When it has spied a hare, it does not swoop on
6igb it at once, but lets it go on into the open ground ; neither
does it descend to the ground at one swoop, but goes
gradually down from higher flights to lower and lower :

these devices it adopts by way of security against the
stratagem of the hunter. It alights on high places by
reason of the difficulty it experiences in soaring up from 5
the level ground ; it flies high in the air to have the more
extensive view; from its high flight it is said to be the
only bird that resembles the gods.1 Birds of prey, as
a rule, seldom alight upon rock, as the crookedness of their
talons prevents a stable footing on hard stone. The eagle
hunts hares, fawns, foxes, and in general all such animals 10
as he can master with ease. It is a long-lived bird, and
this fact might be inferred from the length of time during
which the same nest is maintained in its place.
22 In Scythia 2 there is iound a bird as large as the great
bustard. The female lays two eggs, but does not hatch
them, but hides them in the skin of a hare or fox and 15
leaves them there, and, when it is not in quest of prey, it
keeps a watch on them on a high tree; if any man tries to
climb the tree, it fights and strikes him with its wing, just
as eagles do.
24 The owl and the night-raven and all the birds that see
poorly in the daytime seek their prey in the night, but not 20
all the night through, but at evening and dawn. 3 Their food
consists of mice, lizards, chafers and the like little creatures.
The so-called phene, or lammergeier, is fond of its young,
provides its food with ease, fetches food to its nest,4 and
is of a kindly disposition. It rears its own young and those
of the eagle as well; for when the eagle ejects its young 25
from the nest, this bird catches them up as they fall and
feeds them. For the eagle, by the way, ejects the young
birds prematurely, before they are able to feed themselves,5 6

or to fly. It appears to do so from jealousy ; for it is by
nature jealous, and is so ravenous as to grab furiously at its
30 food; and when it does grab at its food, it grabs it in large
morsels. It is accordingly jealous of the young birds as
they approach maturity, since they are getting good appetites,
and so it scratches them with its talons. The young birds
fight also with one another, to secure a morsel of food or
a comfortable position, whereupon the mother-bird beats
them and ejects them from the nest; the young ones scream
at this treatment, and the phene hearing them catches them
620a as they fall. The phene has a film over its eyes and sees
badly, but the sea-eagle is very keen-sighted, and before its
young are fledged tries to make them stare at the sun,1 and
beats the one that refuses to do so, and twists him back in
the sun’s direction ; and if one of them gets watery eyes in
5 the process, it kills him, and rears the other. It lives near
the sea, and feeds, as has been said, on sea-birds ;2 when in
pursuit of them it catches them one by one, watching the
moment when the bird rises to the surface from its dive.
When a sea-bird, emerging from the water, sees the sea
eagle, he in terror dives under, intending to rise again else
10 where ; the eagle, however, owing to its keenness of vision,
keeps flying after him until he either drowns the bird or
catches him on the surface. The eagle never attacks these
birds when they are in a swarm, for they keep him off by
raising a shower of water-drops with their wings.
The cepphus is caught by means of sea-foam ;:J the bird 35
snaps at the foam, and consequently fishermen catch it by
sluicing with showers of sea-water. These birds grow to
15 be plump and fat; their flesh has a good odour, excepting
the hinder quarters, which smell of shore-weed.
Of hawks, the strongest is the buzzard ; the next in 36

third ; other diverse kinds are the asterias, the pigeon
hawk, and the pternis ; the broader-winged 1 hawk is called
the half-buzzard ; others go by the name of hobby-hawk, 20
or sparrow-hawk, or 4 smooth-feathered ’,2 or ‘ toad-catcher ’.
Birds of this latter species find their food with very little
difficulty, and flutter along the ground. Some say that
there are ten species3 of hawks, all differing from one
another. One hawk, they say, will strike and grab the
pigeon as it rests on the ground, but never touch it while it 25
is in flight ; another hawk attacks the pigeon when it is
perched upon a tree or any elevation, but never touches it
when it is on the ground or on the wing ; other hawks
attack their prey only when it is on the wing. They say
that pigeons can distinguish the various species: so that,
when a hawk is an assailant, if it be one that attacks its 3°
prey when the prey is on the wing, the pigeon will sit still ;
if it be one that attacks sitting prey, the pigeon will rise up
and fly away.
In Thrace, in the district sometimes called that of Cedri
polis, men hunt for little birds in the marshes with the aid
of hawks.4 The men with sticks in their hands go beating at
the reeds and brushwood to frighten the birds out, and the 620b
hawks show themselves overhead and frighten them down.
The men then strike them with their sticks and capture
them. They give a portion of their booty to the hawks;
that is, they throw some of the birds up in the air, and the
hawks catch them. 5
In the neighbourhood of Lake Maeotis, it is said, wolves
act in concert with the fishermen, and if the fishermen
decline to share with them, they tear their nets in pieces
as they lie drying on the shore of the lake.

 620b HISTORIA ANIMALIUM
So much for the habits of birds,
io In marine creatures, also, one may observe many inge¬
nious devices adapted to the circumstances of their lives.
For the accounts commonly given of the so-called fishing
frog are quite true ; as are also those given of the torpedo.1
The fishing-frog has a set of filaments that project in front
of its eyes ;2 they are long and thin like hairs, and are round
15 at the tips; they lie on either side, and are used as baits.
Accordingly, when the animal stirs up a place full of sand
and mud and conceals itself therein, it raises the filaments,
and, when the little fish strike against them, it draws them
in underneath into its mouth. The torpedo3 narcotizes the
creatures that it wants to catch, overpowering them by the
20 power of shock4 that is resident in its body, and feeds upon
them ; it also hides in the sand and mud, and catches all
the creatures that swim in its way and come under its
narcotizing influence. This phenomenon has been actually
observed in operation. The sting-ray also conceals itself,
but not exactly in the same way.5 6 That the creatures get
25 their living by this means is obvious from the fact that,
whereas they are peculiarly inactive, they are often caught

with mullets in their interior, the swiftest of fishes. Fur¬
thermore, the fishing-frog is unusually thin when he is
caught after losing the tips of his filaments, and the
torpedo is known to cause a numbness even in human
beings. Again, the hake, the ray, the flat-fish, and the 3°
angel-fish burrow in the sand, and after concealing them¬
selves angle with the filaments on their mouths,1 that
fishermen call their fishing-rods, and the little creatures
on which they feed swim up to the filaments taking them
for bits of sea-weed, such as they feed upon.
Wherever an anthias-fish is seen, there will be no danger¬
ous creatures in the vicinity, and sponge-divers will dive in
security, and they call these signal-fishes ‘ holy-fish \2 It is 35
a sort of perpetual coincidence, like the fact that wherever

partridge in the neighbourhood ; for both pig and partridge
eat up the snails.3

snout, by the way, is sharper than that of ordinary serpents.
The so-called sea-scolopendra,1 after swallowing the hook,
turns itself inside out until it ejects it, and then it again turns
itself outside in. The sea-scolopendra, like the land-scolo
pendra, will come to a savoury bait; the creature does not
io bite with its teeth, but stings by contact with its entire body,
like the so-called sea-nettle. The so-called fox-shark,2
when it finds it has swallowed the hook, tries to get rid of
it as the scolopendra does, but not in the same way; in
other words, it runs up the fishing-line, and bites it off
15 short; it is caught in some districts in deep and rapid
waters, with night-lines.3
The bonitos4 swarm together when they espy a dangerous
creature, and the largest of them swim round it, and if
it touches one of the shoal they try to repel it; they
have strong teeth.5 Amongst other large fish, a lamia
30 shark, after falling in amongst a shoal, has been seen to
be covered with wounds.
Of river-fish, the male of the sheat-fish 6 is remarkably
attentive to the young. The female after parturition goes
away; the male stays and keeps on guard where the spawn
is most abundant, contenting himself with keeping off all
25 other little fishes that might steal the spawn or fry, and
this he does for forty or fifty days, until the young are
sufficiently grown to make away from the other fishes
1 a<o\u7T€v8pa. What animal is meant is unknown. Cuvier (ad Plin. ix. 67) supposes some annelid, e. g. a large Nereis, whose protrusible proboscis might have suggested a turning inside out, and O. F. Muller and Schneider lean to the same opinion. These animals, however, have no urticating properties. Cf. Plut. S. Num.

for themselves. The fishermen can tell where he is on
guard : for, in warding off the little fishes, he makes a rush
in the water and gives utterance to a kind of muttering
noise. He is so earnest in the performance of his parental
duties that the fishermen at times, if the eggs be attached 30
to the roots of water-plants deep in the water,1 drag them
into as shallow a place as possible ; the male fish will still
keep by the young, and, if it so happen,2 will be caught
by the hook when snapping at the little fish that come by;
if, however, he be sensible by experience of the danger of
the hook, he will still keep by his charge, and with his 62ib
extremely strong teeth will bite the hook in pieces.
All fishes, both those that wander about and those that
are stationary, occupy the districts where they were born
or very similar places, for their natural food is found there.
Carnivorous fish wander most; and all fish are carnivorous 5
with the exception of a few, such as the mullet, the saupe,
the red mullet, and the chalcis. The so-called pholis 3 gives
out a mucous discharge, which envelops the creature in
a kind of nest. Of shell-fish, and fish that are finless, the
scallop moves with greatest force and to the greatest 10
distance, impelled along by some internal energy; the
murex or purple-fish, and others that resemble it, move
hardly at all. Out of the lagoon of Pyrrha4 all the
fishes swim in winter-time, except the sea-gudgeon;
they swim out owing to the cold, for the narrow waters
are colder than the outer sea, and on the return of the early
summer they all swim back again. In the lagoon no 15
scarus is found, nor thritta,5 nor any other species of the

spiny fish, no spotted dogfish, no spiny dogfish, no sea
crawfish, no octopus either of the common or the musky
kinds, and certain other fish are also absent; but of
fish that are found in the lagoon the white gudgeon is
not a marine fish. Of fishes the oviparous are in their
20 prime in the early summer until the spawning time ; the
viviparous in the autumn, as is also the case with the
mullet, the red mullet, and all such fish. In the neighbour¬
hood of Lesbos,1 the fishes of the outer sea, or of the
lagoon, bring forth their eggs or young in the lagoon ;
sexual union takes place in the autumn, and parturition
in the spring. With fishes of the cartilaginous kind, the
25 males and females swarm together in the autumn for the
sake of sexual union; in the early summer they come
swimming in, and keep apart until after parturition ; the
two sexes are often taken linked together in sexual union.
Of molluscs the sepia is the most cunning, and is the
only species that employs its dark liquid for the sake of
30 concealment as well as from fear: the octopus and cala
mary make the discharge solely from fear. These creatures
never discharge the pigment in its entirety; and after a
discharge the pigment accumulates again. The sepia, as
has been said, often uses its colouring pigment for con¬
cealment ; it shows itself in front of the pigment and then
622a retreats back into it;2 it also hunts with its long tentacles
not only little fishes, but oftentimes even mullets. The
octopus is a stupid creature, for it will approach a man’s
hand if it be lowered in the water; but it is neat and
5 thrifty in its habits: that is, it lays up stores in its nest,3
and, after eating up all that is eatable, it ejects the shells
and sheaths of crabs and shell-fish, and the skeletons of
little fishes. It seeks its prey by so changing its colour4 as
to render it like the colour of the stones adjacent to it;
10 it does so also when alarmed. By some the sepia is said to

perform the same trick; that is, they say it can change
its colour so as to make it resemble the colour of its
habitat.1 The only fish that can do this is the angel-fish,
that is, it can change its colour like the octopus. The
octopus as a rule does not live the year out. It has a 15
natural tendency to run off into liquid ; for, if beaten and
squeezed,2 it keeps losing substance and at last disappears.
The female after parturition is peculiarly subject to this
colliquefaction ; it becomes stupid ; if tossed about by waves,
it submits impassively;3 a man, if he dived, could catch
it with the hand; it gets covered over with slime, and 20
makes no effort to catch its wonted prey. The male be¬
comes leathery and clammy. As a proof that they do not
live into a second year there is the fact4 that, after the birth
of the little octopuses in the late summer or beginning of
autumn, it is seldom that a large-sized octopus is visible,
whereas a little before this time of year the creature is 25
at its largest. After the eggs are laid, they say that both
the male and the female grow so old and feeble5 6 that
they are preyed upon by little fish, and with ease dragged
from their holes; and that this could not have been done
previously; they say also that this is not the case with
the small and young octopus, but that the young creature 30
is much stronger than the grown-up one. Neither does
the sepia live into a second year. The octopus is the only
mollusc that ventures on to dry land ; it walks by preference
on rough ground ; it is firm alt over when you squeeze
it, excepting in the neck. So much for the mollusca. 622b

larger as the animal grows larger, and that it comes out
of the sheath as though out of a den or dwelling-place.1
5 The nautilus (or argonaut) is a poulpe or octopus, but one
peculiar both in its nature and its habits.2 It rises up from
deep water and swims on the surface; it rises with its shell
down-turned in order that it may rise the more easily and
swim with it empty, but after reaching the surface it shifts
the position of the shell. In between its feelers it has a
io certain amount of web-growth,3 resembling the substance
between the toes of web-footed birds; only that with these
latter the substance is thick, while with the nautilus it is
thin and like a spider’s web. It uses this structure, when
a breeze is blowing,4 for a sail, and lets down some5 of
its feelers alongside as rudder-oars.6 If it be frightened,
15 it fills its shell with water and sinks. With regard to the
mode of generation and the growth of the shell knowledge
from observation is not yet satisfactory; the shell, however,
does not appear to be there from the beginning, but to
grow in their case as in that of other shell-fish ; neither is it
ascertained for certain whether the animal can live when
stripped of the shell.

38 Of 3.11 insects, one may 3lso say of 3ll living creatures, 20
the most industrious are the ant, the bee, the hornet, the
wasp, and in point of fact all creatures akin to these ; of
spiders some are more skilful and more resourceful than
others.1 The way in which ants work is open to ordinary
observation; how they all march one after the other when 25
they are engaged in putting away and storing up their food ;
all this may be seen, for they carry on their work even
during bright moonlight nights.2
39 Of spiders3 and phalangia there are many species. Of
the venomous phalangia there are two; one that resembles
the so-called wolf-spider, small, speckled, and tapering 30
to a point; it moves with leaps, from which habit it is
nicknamed ‘ the flea ’: the other kind is large, black in
colour, with long front legs; it is heavy in its movements,
walks slowly, is not very strong, and never leaps. (Of all
the other species wherewith poison-vendors supply them¬
selves, some give a weak bite, and others never bite at all. 623a
There is another kind, comprising the so-called wolf
spiders.) Of these spiders the small one weaves no web,
and the large weaves a rude and poorly built one on the
ground or on dry stone walls.4 It always builds its web
over hollow places inside of which it keeps a watch on the
end-threads, until some creature gets into the web and 5
begins to struggle,5 when out the spider pounces. The
speckled kind makes a little shabby web under trees.
There is a third species of this animal, pre-eminently
clever and artistic.6 It first weaves a thread stretching to

ravenously, whereas at other times they are never observed
to be so greedy, but apparently are thrifty and disposed to
lay by for their future sustenance.1 They have also another
food which is called bee-bread ;2 this is scarcer than honey
and has a sweet fig-like taste ; this they carry as they do
25 the wax on their legs.
Very remarkable diversity is observed in their methods
of working and their general habits. When the hive has
been delivered to them clean and empty, they build their
waxen cells,3 bringing in the juice 4 of all kinds of flowers
and the ‘ tears ’ or exuding sap of trees, such as willows
and elms and such others as are particularly given to the
30 exudation of gum.5 With this material they besmear the
ground-work, to provide against attacks of other creatures ;
the bee-keepers call this stuff ‘ stop-wax ’.6 They also with
the same material narrow by side-building the entrances to
the hive if they are too wide. They first build cells for
themselves ; then for the so-called kings and the drones ;7
624s for themselves they are always building, for the kings only
when the brood of young is numerous, and cells for the
drones they build if a superabundance of honey should
suggest their doing so. They build the royal cells next to
their own,8 and they are of small bulk ; the drones' cells

These words, and great part of the context, are very obscure. The queen-cells are not the least, but the largest, and are not united in combs, but are more or less separate from the latter: cf. Plin. xi. 12 ‘ Regias imperatoribus futuris in ima parte alvei exstruunt amplas,magnificas, separatas, tuberculoeminentes’; the drones’ cells are bigger than those of the workers, cf.624b 18, tlai 8e pd(ovs ol raw


 BOOK IX. 40 624
they build near by, and these latter are less in bulk than
the bees’ cells. They begin building the combs down- 5
wards from the top of the hive, and go down and down
building many combs connected together until they reach
the bottom. The cells, both those for the honey and those
also for the grubs, are double-doored ; for two cells are
ranged about a single base, one pointing one way and one
the other, after the manner of a double (or hour-glass¬
shaped) goblet. The cells that lie at the commencement 10
of the combs and are attached to the hives, to the extent
of two or three concentric circular rows, are small and
devoid of honey ; the cells that are well filled with honey
are most thoroughly luted with wax.1 At the entry to the
hive the aperture of the doorway is smeared with mitys;2
this substance is a deep black, and is a sort of dross or 15
residual by-product of wax; it has a pungent odour, and
is a cure for bruises and suppurating sores. The greasy
stuff that comes next is pitch-wax ; it has a less pungent
odour and is less medicinal than the mitys. Some say
that the drones construct combs by themselves in the same
hive and in the same comb that they share with the bees ; 20
but that they make no honey, but subsist, they and their
grubs also, on the honey made by the bees. The drones,
as a rule, keep inside the hive; when they go out of doors,
they soar up in the air in a stream,3 whirling round and
round in a kind of gymnastic exercise ; when this is over, 25
they come inside the hive and feed to repletion ravenously.4
The kings never quit the hive, except in conjunction with
the entire swarm, either for food or for any other reason.5

 624a HISTORIA ANIMALIUM
They say that, if a young swarm go astray, it will turn
back upon its route and by the aid of scent seek out its
30 leader.1 It is said that if he is unable to fly he is carried
by the swarm, and that if he dies the swarm perishes ;
and that, if this swarm outlives the king for a while and
constructs combs, no honey is produced and the bees soon
die out.2 Bees scramble up the stalks of flowers and
rapidly gather the bees-wax with their front legs ; the
624b front legs wipe it off on to the middle legs, and these pass
it on to the hollow curves of the hind-legs;3 when thus
laden, they fly away home, and one may see plainly that
their load is a heavy one. On each expedition the bee
does not fly from a flower of one kind to a flower of
5 another,4 but flies from one violet, say, to another violet,
and never meddles with another flower until it has got back
to the hive ; on reaching the hive they throw off their load,
and each bee on his return is accompanied by three or four
companions.5 One cannot well tell what is the substance
they gather, nor the exact process of their work. Their
mode of gathering wax has been observed on olive-trees.
10 as owing to the thickness of the leaves the bees remain
stationary for a considerable while. After this work is
over, they attend to the grubs. There is nothing to prevent
grubs, honey, and drones being all found in one and the
same comb. As long as the leader is alive, the drones are
said to be produced apart by themselves ; if he be no
longer living, they are said to be reared by the bees in
15 their own cells, and under these circumstances to become
more spirited : for this reason they are called 4 sting-drones’,
not that they really have stings, but that they have the
wish, without the power, to use such weapons. The cells
for the drones are larger than the others; sometimes the
bees construct cells for the drones apart, but usually they
20 put them in amongst their own ; and when this is the case
the bee-keepers cut the drone-cells out of the combs. There
are several species of bees,as has been said; two of ‘kings’,

the better kind red,1 the other black and variegated, and
twice as big as the working-bee. The best working-bee is
small, round, and speckled : another kind is long and like
an anthrene wasp;2 another kind is what is called the 25
robber-bee, black and flat-bellied ;3 then there is the drone,
the largest of all, but devoid of sting, and lazy. There is a
difference between the progeny of bees that inhabit culti¬
vated land and of those from the mountains : the forest
bees are more shaggy, smaller, more industrious and more 30
fierce.4 Working-bees make their combs all even, with the
superficial covering quite smooth. Each comb is of one
kind only: that is, it contains either bees only, or grubs
only, or drones only ; if it happen, however, that they
make in one and the same comb all these kinds of cells,
each separate kind will be built in a continuous row right
through.5 The long bees build uneven combs, with the lids 625**
of the cells protuberant, like those of the anthrene ; grubs
and everything else have no fixed places, but are put
anywhere; from these bees come inferior kings, a large
quantity of drones, and the so-called robber-bee ; they

It may be (as A. and W. suppose) that A. alludes to the two well-marked varieties or species, the common and the Ligurian bee {Apis mellijica and ligustica); and we may note that Vergil speaks of the two sorts of kings having each their own people ‘ Ut binae regum facies, ita corpora plebis’. On the other hand, Kirby and Spence (Lect. xix) think that Vergil (and there¬ fore Aristotle also) regarded the drone as one of the kings or leaders, ‘ Ille horridus alter Desidia latamque trahens inglorius alvum’ (G. iv. 93). ‘ It deserves to be mentioned that there seem actually to be two sorts of queens in the hive, a large one and a small. Needham was the first that observed the latter ; and their existence, Mr. P. Huber tells us, has been confirmed by several observations of his father . . . They are of very rare occurrence 5 (K. and S., /. c.). With the de¬ scription of A. and Vergil, cf. Plin. xi. 19 ‘ Urbanarum duo genera : optimae breves variaeque, et in rotunditate compactiles : deteriores longae et quibus similitudo vesparum : etiamnum deterrimae ex iis pilosae’. Varro, iii. 16, 18 ‘ et ut quidam dicunt, tria genera cum sint ducum in apibus, niger, ruber et varius ; ut Menecrates scribit, duo, niger et varius ; qui ita, melior, ut expediat mellario ; cum duo sunt eadem alvo, interficere nigrum ’. In these passages, especially in the last, we seem to discern a reference to the common, or black, and the Ligurian bees: but Pliny (xi. 16) also describes, less intelligibly, the two varieties of ‘ kings ’. 2 H.

5 produce either no honey at all, or honey in very small
quantities. Bees brood over the combs and so mature
them; if they fail to do so, the combs are said to go bad
and to get covered with a sort of spider’s web.1 If they
can keep brooding over the part undamaged, the damaged
part simply eats itself away ; if they cannot so brood, the
io entire comb perishes; in the damaged combs small worms
are engendered, which take on wings and fly away. When
the combs keep settling down, the bees restore the level
surface, and put props underneath the combs to give
themselves free passage-room;2 for if such free passage
be lacking they cannot brood, and the cobwebs come on.
When the robber-bee and the drone appear, not only do
15 they do no work themselves, but they actually damage the
work of the other bees ; if they are caught in the act, they
are killed by the working-bees. These bees also kill
without mercy most of their kings, and especially kings
of the inferior sort ;3 and this they do for fear a multi¬
plicity of kings should lead to a dismemberment of the
hive.4 They kill them especially when the hive is deficient
20 in grubs, and a swarm is not intended to take place ; under
these circumstances they destroy the cells of the kings if
they have been prepared, on the ground that these kings
are always ready to lead out swarms. They destroy also
the combs of the drones if a failure in the honey supply be
threatening and the hive runs short of provisions ; under
such circumstances they fight desperately with all who try
25 to take their honey, and eject from the hive all the resident
drones ; and oftentimes the drones are to be seen sitting
apart in the hive. The little bees fight vigorously with
the long kind, and try to banish them from the hives; if
they succeed, the hive will be unusually productive, but if
the bigger bees get left mistresses of the field they pass the
30 time in idleness, and do no good at all but die out before
the autumn. Whenever the working-bees kill an enemy
they try to do so out of doors;5 and whenever one of

their own body dies, they carry the dead bee out of doors
also. The so-called robber-bees spoil their own combs,
and, if they can do so unnoticed, enter and spoil the combs 62515
of other bees ; if they are caught in the act they are put to
death. It is no easy task for them to escape detection, for
there are sentinels on guard at every entry; and, even if
they do escape detection on entering, afterwards from a
surfeit of food they cannot fly, but go rolling about in 5
front of the hive, so that their chances of escape are small
indeed. The kings are never themselves seen outside the
hive except with a swarm in flight: during which time all
the other bees cluster around them. When the flight of a
swarm is imminent, a monotonous and quite peculiar sound
made by all the bees is heard for several days, and for two
or three days in advance a few bees are seen flying round 10
the hive; it has never as yet been ascertained, owing to
the difficulty of the observation, whether or no the king is
among these.1 When they have swarmed, they fly away
and separate off to each of the kings ; if a small swarm
happens to settle near to a large one, it will shift to join
this large one, and if the king whom they have abandoned 15
follows them, they put him to death. So much for the
quitting of the hive and the swarm-flight. Separate detach¬
ments of bees are told off for diverse operations ; that is,
some carry flower-produce, others carry water, others smooth
and arrange the combs.2 A bee carries water when it is 20
rearing grubs. No bee ever settles on the flesh of any
creature, or ever eats animal food. They have no fixed
date for commencing work ; but when their provender is
forthcoming and they are in comfortable trim, and by
preference in summer, they set to work, and when the
weather is fine they work incessantly. The bee, when quite
young and in fact only three days old, after shedding its 25
chrysalis-case, begins to work if it be well fed.3 When a
swarm is settling, some bees detach themselves in search
of food and return back to the swarm. In hives that are

 HISTORIA ANIMALIUM
in good condition the production of young bees is dis¬
continued only for the forty days that follow the winter
30 solstice.1 When the grubs are grown, the bees put food
beside them and cover them with a coating of wax; and,
as soon as the grub is strong enough, he of his own accord
breaks the lid and comes out. Creatures that make their
appearance in hives and spoil the combs the working-bees
clear out, but the other bees from sheer laziness look with
indifference on damage done to their produce. When the
626s bee-masters take out the combs, they leave enough food
behind for winter use ; if it be sufficient in quantity, the
occupants of the hive will survive ; if it be insufficient,
then, if the weather be rough, they die on the spot, but if it
be fair, they fly away and desert the hive. They feed on
5 honey summer and winter ; but they store up another
article of food resembling wax in hardness, which by some
is called sandarace, or bee-bread. Their worst enemies 54
are wasps and the birds named titmice, and further¬
more the swallow and the bee-eater. The frogs in the
marsh also catch them if they come in their way by the
10 water-side, and for this reason bee-keepers chase the frogs
from the ponds from which the bees take water; they
destroy also wasps’ nests, and the nests of swallows, in the
neighbourhood of the hives, and also the nests of bee-eaters.
Bees have fear only of one another. They fight with one
15 another and with wasps. Away from the hive they attack
neither their own species nor any other creature, but in the
close proximity of the hive they kill whatever they get

hold of. Bees that sting die from their inability to extract
the sting1 without at the same time extracting their intes¬
tines. True,2 they often recover, if the person stung takes
the trouble to press the sting out; but once it loses its sting 20
the bee must die. They can kill with their stings even
large animals; in fact, a horse has been known to have
been stung to death by them.3 The kings are the least
disposed to show anger or to inflict a sting. Bees that die
are removed from the hive,4 and in every way the creature
is remarkable for its cleanly habits ; in point of fact, they 25
often fly away to a distance to void their excrement
because it is malodorous ; and, as has been said, they are
annoyed by all bad smells and by the scent of perfumes,
so much so that they sting people that use perfumes.5
They perish from a number of accidental causes, and when
their kings become too numerous and try each to carry
away a portion of the swarm. The toad also feeds on 30
bees ; he comes to the doorway of the hive, puffs himself
out as he sits on the watch, and devours the creatures as
they come flying out; the bees can in no way retaliate,6
but the bee-keeper makes a point of killing him. As for 626b
the class of bee that has been spoken of as inferior or
good-for-nothing, and as constructing its combs so roughly,
some bee-keepers say that it is the young bees that act so
from inexperience ; and the bees of the current year are
termed young. The young bees do not sting as the others 5
do ; and it is for this reason that swarms may be safely
carried, as it is of young bees that they are composed.
When honey runs short they expel the drones, and the
bee-keepers supply the bees with figs and sweet-tasting
articles of food.7 The elder bees do the indoor work, and

are rough and hairy from staying indoors ; the young bees
do the outer carrying, and are comparatively smooth,
io They kill the drones also when in their work they are
confined for room ; the drones, by the way, live in the
innermost recess of the hive. On one occasion, when a
hive was in a poor condition, some of the occupants
assailed a foreign hive ; proving victorious in a combat
they took to carrying off the honey when the bee-keeper
tried to kill them, the other bees came out and tried to
15 beat off the enemy but made no attempt to sting the man.
The diseases that chiefly attack prosperous hives are first
of all the clerus1 2 *—this consists in a growth of little worms
on the floor, from which, as they develop, a kind of cobweb
grows over the entire hive, and the combs decay; another
diseased condition :j is indicated in a lassitude on the part
20 of the bees and in malodorousness of the hive. Bees
feed on thyme ;4 and the white thyme is better than the
red.5 In summer the place for the hive should be cool,
and in winter warm. They are very apt to fall sick if the
plant they are at work on be mildewed. In a high wind
25 they carry a stone by way of ballast to steady them.6 If a
stream be near at hand, they drink from it and from it
only, but before they drink they first deposit their load ;
if there be no water near at hand, they disgorge their
honey as they drink7 elsewhere, and at once 8 make off to
work. There are two seasons for making honey, spring
30 and autumn ;9 the spring honey is sweeter, whiter, and in
every way better than the autumn honey. Superior honey
comes from fresh comb, and from young shoots; the red
honey is inferior, and owes its inferiority to the comb in

which it is deposited, just as wine is apt to be spoiled
by its cask; consequently, one should have it looked
to and dried. When the thyme is in flower and the 627**
comb is full, the honey does not harden.1 The honey
that is golden in hue is excellent. White honey does
not come from thyme pure and simple; it is good as a
salve for sore eyes and wounds. Poor honey always floats
on the surface and should be skimmed off; the fine clear
honey rests below. When the floral world is in full bloom, 5
then they make wax; consequently you must then take
the wax out of the hive, for they go to work on new wax
at once. The flowers from which* they gather honey are
as follows: the spindle-tree, the melilot-clover, king’s
spear, myrtle, flowering-reed, withy,2 and broom.3 When
they work at thyme, they mix in water before sealing up4
the comb. As has been already stated, they all either fly 10
to a distance to discharge their excrement or make the
discharge into one single comb. The little bees, as has
been said, are more industrious than the big ones; their
wings are battered; their colour is black, and they have
a burnt-up aspect. Gaudy and showy bees, like gaudy
and showy women, are good-for-nothings. Bees seem to 15
take a pleasure in listening to a rattling noise;5 and con¬
sequently men say that they can muster them into a hive
by rattling with crockery or stones;6 it is uncertain,
however, whether or no they can hear the noise at all,
and also whether their procedure is due to pleasure or

alarm. They expel from the hive all idlers and unthrifts.
20 As has been said, they differentiate their work ; some
make wax,1 some make honey, some make bee-bread,
some shape and mould combs, some bring water to the
cells and mingle it with the honey, some engage in
out-of-door work. At early dawn they make no noise,
until some one particular bee makes a buzzing noise two
or three times and thereby awakes the rest; hereupon
25 they all fly in a body to work. By and by they return
and at first are noisy; then the noise gradually decreases,
until at last some one bee flies round about, making a
buzzing noise, and apparently calling on the others to go
to sleep ; then all of a sudden there is a dead silence.2
The hive is known to be in good condition if the noise
heard within it is loud, and if the bees make a flutter as
they go out and in ; for at this time they are constructing
30 brood-cells. They suffer most from hunger when they
recommence work after winter. They become somewhat
lazy if the bee-keeper, in robbing the hive, leave behind
too much honey;3 still one should leave cells numerous
in proportion to the population, for the bees work in a
627b spiritless way if too few combs are left. They become idle
also, as being dispirited, if the hive be too big. A hive
yields to the bee-keeper six or nine pints of honey; a
prosperous hive will yield twelve or fifteen pints, exception¬
ally good hives eighteen. Sheep 4 and, as has been said,
5 wasps are enemies to the bees.5 Bee-keepers entrap the
latter, by putting a flat dish on the ground with pieces of
meat on it ; when a number of the wasps settle on it, they
cover them with a lid and put the dish and its contents on
the fire. It is a good thing to have a few drones in a hive,
10 as their presence increases the industry of the workers.

 I BOOK IX. 40 627
Bees can tell the approach of rough weather or of rain ;
and the proof is that they will not fly away, but even while
it is as yet fine they go fluttering about within a restricted
space, and the bee-keeper knows from this that they are
expecting bad weather.1 When the bees inside the hive
hang clustering to one another, it is a sign that the swarm
is intending to quit;2 consequently, bee-keepers, on seeing
this, besprinkle the hive with sweet wine. It is advisable
to plant about the hives pear-trees, beans, Median-grass,
Syrian-grass, yellow pulse, myrtle, poppies, creeping-thyme,
and almond-trees. Some bee-keepers sprinkle their bees
with flour, and can distinguish them from others when they
are at work out of doors. If the spring be late, or if there
be drought or blight, then grubs are all the fewer in the
hives.3 So much for the habits of bees.
41 Of wasps,4 there are two kinds. Of these kinds one is
wild 5 and scarce, lives on the mountains, engenders grubs
not underground but on oak-trees, is larger, longer, and
blacker than the other kind, is invariably speckled and
furnished with a sting, and is remarkably courageous. The
pain from its sting is more severe than that caused by the
others, for the instrument that causes the pain is larger, in
proportion to its own larger size. These wild wasps live
over into a second year, and in winter time, when oaks
have been in course of felling, they may be seen coming
out and flying away. They lie concealed during the winter,
and live in the interior of logs of wood. Some of them
are mother-wasps and some are workers, as with the tamer
kind ; but it is by observation of the tame wasps that one
may learn the varied characteristics of the mothers and the

628a workers. For in the case of the tame wasps also there are
two kinds ; one consists of leaders, who are called mothers,
and the other of workers. The leaders are far larger and
milder-tempered than the others. The workers do not live
over into a second year, but all die when winter comes on ;
5 and this can be proved, for at the commencement of winter
the workers become drowsy, and about the time of the
winter solstice they are never seen at all. The leaders, the
so-called mothers, are seen all through the winter, and live
in holes underground ; for men when ploughing or digging
in winter have often come upon mother-wasps, but never
io upon workers. The mode of reproduction of wasps is as
follows. At the approach of summer, when the leaders
have found a sheltered 1 spot, they take to moulding their
combs, and construct the so-called sphecons,—little nests
containing four cells2 or thereabouts, and in these are
produced working-wasps but not mothers. When these
15 are grown up, then they construct other larger combs upon
the first, and then again in like manner others ; so that
by the close of autumn there are numerous large combs,
in which the leader, the so-called mother, engenders no
longer working-wasps but mothers. These develop high
up in the nest as large grubs, in cells that occur in groups
20 of four or rather more, pretty much in the same way as we
have seen the grubs of the king-bees to be produced in
their cells.3 After the birth of the working-grubs in the
cells, the leaders do nothing and the workers have to
supply them with nourishment; and this is inferred from
1 For fv(TK07rop read cvo-Ktur), a favourite word of Theophrastus, e. g.

7T^f, &C. 2 olov Tfrpndvpovs. Whether this word be correct or not, the meaning is certainly ‘containing four cells (6vpl8es) * and not ‘ provided with four
doors (dvpai) ’. Cf. 628® 20 iv dvplai avve\i(ri TtTTapair, ktA.
3 I think that Schneider, and A. and W. who follow him, are right in attributing this comparison to the cells of the king-bee rather than to the original group of four cells that form the foundation of the wasps’ nest. According to Schn. ‘ Krjpia non sunt crabronum, sed apum ; igitur etiam rjyfpovcs apum intelliguntur, et comparatio fit cellarum utriusque generis ducum’. It is the case that queens, and males also, are not developed until towards autumn, at which time larger cells are constructed for the reception of the eggs which are to produce them.


 BOOK IX. 41 628a
the fact that the leaders [of the working-wasps] 1 no longer
fly out at this time, but rest quietly indoors. Whether the 25
leaders of last year after engendering new leaders are killed
by the new brood, and whether this occurs invariably
or whether they can live for a longer time, has not been
ascertained by actual observation ; neither can we speak
with certainty, as from observation, as to the age attained
by the mother-wasp or by the wild wasps, or as to any
other similar phenomenon. The mother-wasp is broad and 3°
heavy, fatter and larger than the ordinary wasp, and from
its weight not very strong on the wing ; these wasps cannot
fly far, and for this reason they always rest inside the nest,
building and managing its indoor arrangements. The
so-called mother-wasps are found in most of the nests;2 it
is a matter of doubt whether or no they are provided with 628b
stings ; in all probability, like the king-bees, they have
stings, but never protrude them for offence. Of the ordinary
wasps some are destitute of stings, like the drone-bees,
and some are provided with them. Those unprovided
therewith are smaller and less spirited and never fight, while 5
the others are big and courageous ; and these latter, by
some, are called males, and the stingless, females. 3 At the
approach of winter many of the wasps that have stings
appear to lose them; but we have never met an eyewitness
of this phenomenon. Wasps are more abundant in times
of drought and in wild localities. They live underground ;4 10
their combs they mould out of chips and earth, each comb
from a single origin, like a kind of root. They feed on
certain flowers and fruits, but for the most part5 on animal
food. Some of the tame wasps have been observed when
sexually united, but it was not determined whether both,
or neither, had stings, or whether one had a sting and the 15
other had not; wild wasps have been seen under similar
circumstances, when one was seen to have a sting but the
case of the other was left undetermined. The wasp-grub
1 t£>v epyarcov is apparently corrupt, and is deleted by A. and W. 2 Plin. /. c. 6 The stingless wasps are the males; cf. 628b 20. 4 Cf. V rufa, germanica, &c. 5 Dittm. reads rrjv de nXeiarqv (exovaiv'). rfj de tt\(l<tttj would seem the simplest reading.


 HISTORIA ANIMALIUM

does not appear to come into existence by parturition, for
at the outset the grub is too big to be the offspring of
a wasp. If you take a wasp by the feet and let him buzz
20 with the vibration of his wings, wasps that have no stings
will fly towards it, and wasps that have stings will not;1
from which fact it is inferred by some that one set are
males and the other females. In holes in the ground in
winter-time wasps are found, some with stings, and some
without. Some build cells, small and few in number;
25 others build many and large ones. The so-called mothers
are caught at the change of season, mostly on elm-trees,
while gathering a substance sticky and gumlike. A large
number of mother-wasps are found when in the previous
year wasps have been numerous and the weather rainy ;
they are captured in precipitous places, or in vertical clefts
3° in the ground, and they all appear to be furnished with
stings.
So much for the habits of wasps. 42
Anthrenae2 do not subsist by culling from flowers as
bees do, but for the most part on animal food : for this
reason they hover about dung ; for they chase the large
flies, and after catching them lop off their heads and fly
629a away with the rest of the carcases ; they are furthermore
fond of sweet fruits. Such is their food. They have also
kings or leaders3 like bees and wasps ; and their leaders
5 are larger in proportion to themselves than are wasp-kings
to wasps or bee-kings to bees. The anthrena-king, like
the wasp-king, lives indoors. Anthrenae build their nests
1 Antig. Mit'ab. lvii. 2 Vespae, Plin. xi. 24. The avdprjvai here described are different from those of H. A. v. 20. The present species is strongly suggestive of Bembex rostrata, a large wasp of southern Europe, which bites off the heads of large gadflies, carries their bodies home hugged to its breast, and burrows rapidly in sandy soil. Bembex, however, is solitary: accordingly, the Aristotelian account of the colony and nest must either be based on investigation of an unknown species or may have become inaccurate through confusing the large underground nest of Vespa rufa or some similar common species with that of Bembex itself. 3 q-yf/xovfs-. Plin. /. c. ‘ Nec crabronum autem nec vesparum generi reges aut examina’, on which Cuvier remarks ‘Non monarchica civitas vesparum ; plures simul mares, plures feininae ’.


 BOOK IX. 42 629
underground, scraping out the soil like ants ; for neither
anthrenae nor wasps go off in swarms as bees do, but
successive layers of young anthrenae keep to the same 10
habitat, and go on enlarging their nest by scraping out
more and more of soil. The nest accordingly attains a
great size ; in fact, from a particularly prosperous nest have
been removed three and even four baskets full of combs.
They do not, like bees, store up food, but pass the winter
in a torpid condition ; the greater part of them die in the 15
winter, but it is uncertain whether that can be said of them
all. In the hives of bees several kings are found and they
lead off detachments in swarms, but in the anthrena’s nest
only one king is found. When individual anthrenae have
strayed from their nest, they cluster on a tree and construct
combs,3 as may be often seen above-ground, and in this 20
nest they produce a king ; when the king is full-grown,1 2 he
leads them away and settles them along with himself in a
hive or nest. With regard to their sexual unions,3 and the
method of their reproduction, nothing is known from actual
observation. Among bees both the drones and the kings
are stingless, and so are certain wasps, as has been said ; 25
but anthrenae appear to be all furnished with stings:
though, by the way, it would well be worth while to carry
out investigation as to whether the anthrena-king has a
sting or not.
43 Humble-bees 4 produce their young under a stone, right
on the ground, in a couple of cells or little more ; in these
cells is found an attempt at honey, of a poor description. 30
The tenthredon 5 is like the anthrena, but speckled, and

fish and the like dainties. The tenthredon brings forth,
like the wasp, underground, and is very prolific ; its nest
62915 is much bigger and longer than that of the wasp. So
much for the methods of working and the habits of life
of the bee, the wasp, and all the other similar insects.
5 As regards the disposition or temper of animals, as has 44
been previously observed,1 one may detect great differences
in respect to courage and timidity, as also, even among
wild animals, in regard to tameness and wildness. The
lion, while he is eating,2 is most ferocious; but when he is
not hungry and has had a good meal, he is quite gentle.
10 He is totally devoid of suspicion or nervous fear, is fond
of romping with animals that have been reared along with
him and to whom he is accustomed, and manifests great
affection towards them. In the chase,3 as long as he is in
view, he makes no attempt to run and shows no fear, but
even if he be compelled by the multitude of the hunters to
retreat, he withdraws deliberately, step by step, every now
15 and then4 turning his head to regard his pursuers. If,
however, he reach wooded cover, then he runs at full speed,
until he comes to open ground, when he resumes his
leisurely retreat. When, in the open, he is forced by the
number of the hunters to run while in full view, he does
run at the top of his speed, but without leaping and
bounding. This running of his is evenly and continuously
kept up like the running of a dog ; but when he is in
20 pursuit of his prey and is close behind, he makes a sudden
pounce upon it. The two statements made regarding him
are quite true; the one that he is especially afraid of fire,
as Homer pictures him in the line—‘ and glowing torches,

which, though fierce, he dreads/1—and the other, that he
keeps a steady eye upon the hunter who hits him, and
flings himself upon him. If a hunter hit him, without 25
hurting him,2 then if with a bound he gets hold of him,
he will do him no harm, not even with his claws, but after
shaking him and giving him a fright will let him go again.
They invade the cattle-folds3 and attack human beings
when they are grown old and so by reason of old age and
the diseased condition of their teeth are unable to pursue
their wonted, prey.4 They live to a good old age. The 3°
lion who was captured when lame, had a number of his
teeth broken ; which fact was regarded by some as a proof
of the longevity of lions, as he could hardly have been
reduced to this condition except at an advanced age.5
There are two species of lions,6 the plump, curly-maned,
and the long-bodied, straight-maned ;7 the latter kind is
courageous, and the former comparatively timid ; some¬
times they run away with their tail between their legs, like 630**
a dog. A lion was once seen to be on the point of attacking
a boar, but to run away when the boar stiffened his bristles
in defence. It is susceptible of hurt from a wound in the
flank, but on any other part of its frame will endure any
number of blows, and its head is especially hard. When¬
ever it inflicts a wound, either by its teeth or its claws, there 5

flows from the wounded parts suppurating matter, quite
yellow, and not to be stanched by bandage or sponge;
the treatment for such a wound is the same as that for the
bite of a dog.
The thos, or civet, is fond of man’s company ;l it does him
10 no harm and is not much afraid of him, but it is an enemy
to the dog and the lion, and consequently is not found in
the same habitat with them. The little ones are the best.
Some say that there are two species of the animal, and some
say, three; there are probably not more than three, but, as
is the case with certain of the-fishes, birds, and quadrupeds,
15 this animal changes in appearance with the change of
season. His colour in winter is not the same as it is in
summer;2 in summer the animal is smooth-haired, in winter
he is clothed in fur.
The bison is found in Paeonia on Mount Messapium, 4
which separates Paeonia from Maedica ; and the Paeonians
20 call it the monapos.3 It is the size of a bull, but stouter in
build, and not long in the body ; its skin, stretched tight
on a frame, would give sitting room for seven people. In
general it resembles the ox in appearance, except that it
has a mane that reaches down to the point of the shoulder,
as that of the horse reaches down to its withers ; but the
25 hair in its mane is softer than the hair in the horse’s mane,
and clings more closely. The colour of the hair is brown
yellow ; the mane reaches down to the eyes, and is deep
and thick. The colour of the body 4 is half red, half ashen
grey, like5 that of the so-called chestnut horse, but rougher.
It has an undercoat of woolly hair. The animal is not
30 found either very black or very red. It has the bellow
of a bull. Its horns are crooked, turned inwards towards
each other and useless for purposes of self-defence ; they
are a span broad, or a little more, and in volume each horn

would hold about three pints of liquid ; the black colour of
the horn is beautiful and bright. The tuft of hair on the
forehead reaches down to the eyes, so that the animal sees 1 630
objects on either flank better than objects right in front.
It has no upper teeth, as is the case also with kine and all
other horned animals. Its legs are hairy ; it is cloven¬
footed, and the tail, which resembles that of the ox, seems
not big enough for the size of its body. It tosses up dust 5
and scoops out the ground with its hooves, like the bull.
Its skin is impervious to blows. Owing to the savour of
its flesh it is sought for in the chase. When it is wounded
it runs away, and stops only when thoroughly exhausted.
It defends itself against an assailant by kicking and pro¬
jecting its excrement to a distance of eight yards ; this
device it can easily adopt over and over again, and the 10
excrement is so pungent that the hair of hunting-dogs is
burnt off by it. It is only when the animal is disturbed or
alarmed that the dung has this property; when the animal
is undisturbed it has no blistering effect. So much for the
shape and habits of the animal. When the season comes
for parturition the mothers give birth to their young in
troops upon the mountains. Before dropping their young 15
they scatter their dung in all directions, making a kind
of circular rampart around them ; for the animal has
the faculty of ejecting excrement in most extraordinary
quantities.
46 Of all wild animals the most easily tamed and the
gentlest is the elephant. It can be taught a number of
tricks, the drift and meaning of which it understands ; as,
for instance, it can be taught to kneel in presence of the 20
king.1 2 It is very sensitive, and possessed of an intelligence
superior to that of other animals. When the male has had
sexual union with the female, and the female has conceived,
the male has no further intercourse with her.3

 HISTORIA ANIMALIUM

Some say that the elephant lives for two hundred years;
others, for one hundred and twenty j1 that the female lives
nearly as long as the male; that they reach their prime
25 about the age of sixty, and that they are sensitive to incle¬
ment weather and frost. The elephant is found by the banks
of rivers, but he is not a river animal; he can make his
way through water, as long as the tip of his trunk can be
above the surface, for he blows with his trunk and breathes
through it.2 The animal is a poor swimmer owing to the
30 heavy weight of his body.
The male camel declines intercourse with its mother; 47
if his keeper tries compulsion, he evinces disinclination.
On one occasion, when intercourse was being declined by
the young male, the keeper covered over the mother and
put the young male to her ; but, when after the intercourse3
the wrapping had been removed, though the operation was
completed and could not be revoked, still by and by he bit
63ia his keeper to death.4 A story goes5 that the king of
Scythia had a highly-bred mare, and that all her foals
were splendid ; that wishing to mate the best of the young
males with the mother,6 he had him brought to the stall
for the purpose ; that the young horse declined ; that, after
the mother’s head had been concealed in a wrapper he,
in ignorance, had intercourse ; and that, when immediately
5 afterwards the wrapper was removed and the head of the
mare was rendered visible, the young horse ran away and
hurled himself down a precipice.
Among the sea-fishes many stories are told about the 48
dolphin, indicative of his gentle and kindly nature, and of

manifestations of passionate attachment to boys,J in and
about Tarentum, Caria, and other places. The story goes2 10
that, after a dolphin had been caught and wounded off the
coast of Caria, a shoal of dolphins came into the harbour
and stopped there until the fisherman let his captive go
free; whereupon the shoal departed.3 A shoal of young
dolphins is always, by way of protection, followed by a 15
large one. On one occasion a shoal of dolphins, large and
small, was seen, and two dolphins at a little distance4
appeared swimming in underneath a little dead dolphin
when it was sinking, and supporting it on their backs,
trying out of compassion to prevent its being devoured by
some predaceous fish. Incredible stories are told regarding 20
the rapidity of movement of this creature. It appears to
be the fleetest of all animals, marine and terrestrial, and it
can leap over the masts of large vessels.5 This speed is
chiefly manifested when they are pursuing a fish for food ;
then, if the fish endeavours to escape, they pursue him in 25
their ravenous hunger down to deep waters ; but, when the
necessary return swim is getting too long, they hold in
their breath, as though calculating the length of it, and
then draw themselves together6 for an effort and shoot up
like arrows, trying to make the long ascent rapidly in
order to breathe, and in the effort they spring right over
a ships masts if a ship be in the vicinity. This same 3°
phenomenon is observed in divers, when they have plunged
into deep water; that is, they pull themselves together and
rise with a speed proportional to their strength. Dolphins 63ib
live together in pairs, male and female. It is not known
for what reason they run themselves aground on dry land ;
at all events, it is said that they do so at times, and for no
obvious reason.

5 Just as with all animals a change of action follows a 49
change of circumstance, so also a change of character
follows a change of action, and often some portions of the
physical frame undergo a change, as occurs in the case of
birds. Hens, for instance, when they have beaten the cock
in a fight, will crow like the cock and endeavour to tread
10 him ; the crest rises up on their head and the tail-feathers
on the rump, so that it becomes difficult to recognize
that they are hens ; in some cases there is a growth of
small spurs.1 On the death of a hen a cock has been seen
to undertake the maternal duties, leading the chickens
15 about and providing them with food, and so intent upon
these duties as to cease crowing and indulging his sexual
propensities. Some cock-birds are congenitally so feminine
that they will submit patiently to other males who attempt
to tread them.
Some animals change their form and character, not only 50
20 at certain ages and at certain seasons, but in consequence
of being castrated ; and all animals possessed of testicles
may be submitted to this operation. Birds have their
testicles inside, and oviparous quadrupeds close to the
loins; and of viviparous animals that walk some have them
inside, and most have them outside, but all have them at
25 the lower end of the belly. Birds are castrated at the
rump at the part where the two sexes unite in copulation.
If you burn this twice or thrice with hot irons, then, if the
bird be full-grown, his crest grows sallow, he ceases to
crow, and foregoes sexual passion ; but if you cauterize the
bird when young, none of these male attributes or pro
30 pensities will come to him as he grows up. The case is
the same with men : if you mutilate them in boyhood, the
1 The hen that assumed the voice and plumage of the male was often referred to as an omen or portent, e. g. Terent. Phorm. iv. 4. 30 ‘ gallina cecinit ’; Liv. xli. 6 * gallinam in gallum, gallum in gallinam versum’: see also Ael. v. 5. For an account of such superstitions cf. Hopf, Thierorakel, pp. 164, 165 ; and for physiological discussion cf. John Hunter, ‘ Of the Appearance of the Change of Sex in Lady Tynte’s Peahen,’ Phil. Trans. Ixx, p. 534 ; G. St. Hilaire, Femclles du faisan a plumage des males, Paris, 1826; Yarrell, On the Change of Plumage of some Hen Pheasants, London, 1827, &c.


 BOOK IX. 50 63ib
later-growing hair never comes, and the voice never changes
but remains high-pitched ; if they be mutilated in early 632s
manhood, the late growths of hair quit them except the
growth on the groin, and that diminishes but does not
entirely depart. The congenital growths of hair never fall
out, for a eunuch never grows bald. In the case of all
castrated or mutilated male quadrupeds the voice changes 5
to the feminine voice. All other quadrupeds when castrated,
unless the operation be performed when they are young,
invariably die ; but in the case of boars, and in their case
only, the age at which the operation is performed produces
no difference. All animals, if operated on when they are
young, become bigger and better looking than their un¬
mutilated fellows ; if they be mutilated when full-grown,
they do not take on any increase of size. If stags be 10
mutilated when, by reason of their age, they have as yet
no horns, they never grow horns at all ; if they be mutilated
when they have horns, the horns remain unchanged in size,
and the animal does not lose them. Calves are mutilated
when a year old ; otherwise, they turn out uglier and
smaller. Steers are mutilated in the following way: they *5
turn the animal over on its back, cut a little off the
scrotum 1 at the lower end, and squeeze out the testicles,
then push back the roots of them as far as they can,
and stop up the incision with hair to give an outlet to
suppurating matter; if inflammation ensues, they cauterize
the scrotum and put on a plaster. If a full-grown bull be 20
mutilated, he can still to all appearance unite sexually2
with the cow. The ovaries of sows are excised with the
view of quenching in them sexual appetites and of stimu¬
lating growth in size and fatness. The sow has first to be
kept two days without food, and, after being hung up by
the hind legs, it is operated on ; they cut the lower belly,
about the place where the boars have their testicles, for it
is there that the ovary grows, adhering to the two divisions 25
(or horns) of the womb ; they cut off a little piece and stitch
up the incision. Female camels are mutilated when they

are wanted for war purposes, and are mutilated to prevent
their being got with young. Some of the inhabitants of
Upper Asia have as many as three thousand camels : when
they run,1 they run, in consequence of the length of their
30 stride, much quicker than the horses of Nisaea.2 As a
general rule, mutilated animals grow to a greater length
than the unmutilated.
All animals that ruminate derive profit and pleasure
from the process of rumination, as they do from the process
632b of eating. It is the animals that lack the upper teeth that
ruminate, such as kine, sheep,-and goats. In the case of
wild animals no observation has been possible ; save in the
case of animals that are occasionally domesticated, such as
the stag, and it, we know, chews the cud. All animals
that ruminate generally do so when lying down on the
5 ground. They carry on the process to the greatest extent
in winter, and stall-fed ruminants carry it on for about
seven months in the year ; beasts that go in herds, as they
get their food out of doors, ruminate to a lesser degree and
over a lesser period. Some, also, of the animals that have
teeth in both jaws ruminate; as, for instance, the Pontic
10 mice,3 and the fish which from the habit is by some called
‘ the Ruminant ’, [as well as other fish].4
Long-limbed animals have loose faeces, and broad
chested animals vomit with comparative facility, and these
remarks are, in a general way, applicable to quadrupeds,
birds, and men.
A considerable number of birds change according to 49
15 season the colour of their plumage and their note ; as, for
instance, the owsel becomes yellow instead of black, and
its note gets altered, for in summer it has a musical note
and in winter a discordant chatter.5 The thrush also
changes its colour ; about the throat it is marked in winter

with speckles like a starling, in summer distinctly spotted :
however, it never alters its note. The nightingale, when 20
the hills are taking on verdure, sings continually for fifteen
days and fifteen nights; afterwards it sings, but not con¬
tinuously.1 As summer advances it has a different song,
not so varied as before, nor so deep, nor so intricately
modulated, but simple ; it also changes its colour, and in 25
Italy about this season it goes by a different name. It
goes into hiding, and is consequently visible only for a
brief period.2
The erithacus (or redbreast) and the so-called redstart
change into one another;:: the former is a winter bird, the
latter a summer one, and the difference between them is
practically limited to the coloration of their plumage. 30
In the same way with the beccafico and the blackcap ;
these change into one another.4 The beccafico appears
about autumn, and the blackcap as soon as autumn has
ended. These birds, also, differ from one another only in 633
colour and note; that these birds, two in name, are one in
reality is proved by the fact that at the period when the
change is in progress each one has been seen with the change
as yet incomplete.5 It is not so very strange that in these
cases there is a change in note and in plumage, for even the 5
ring-dove ceases to coo in winter, and recommences cooing
when spring comes in ; in winter, however, when fine
weather has succeeded to very stormy weather, this bird
has been known to give its cooing note, to the astonish¬
ment of such as were acquainted with its usual winter
silence. As a general rule, birds sing most loudly and 10
most diversely in the pairing season. The cuckoo changes
its colour, and its note is not clearly heard for a short time
previous to its departure. It departs about the rising of
the Dog-star, and it reappears from springtime to the
rising of the Dog-star. At the rise of this star the bird
called by some oenanthe disappears, and reappears when 15

it is setting thus keeping clear at one time of extreme
cold, and at another time of extreme heat. The hoopoe
also changes its colour and appearance,1 2 as Aeschylus has
represented in the following lines3:
The Hoopoe, witness to his own distress, Is clad by Zeus in variable dress :
20 Now a gay mountain-bird, with knightly crest,
Now in the white hawk’s silver plumage drest ; For, timely changing, on the hawk’s white wing He greets the apparition of the Spring.
Thus twofold form and colour are conferred, In youth and age, upon the selfsame bird.
The spangled raiment marks his youthful days,
25 The argent his maturity displays ;
And when the fields are yellow with ripe corn Again his particoloured plumes are worn.
But evermore, in sullen discontent,
He seeks the lonely hills, in self-sought banishment.
Of birds, some take a dust-bath by rolling in dust, some
take a water-bath, and some take neither the one bath nor
the other.4 Birds that do not fly but keep on the ground
633b take the dust-bath, as for instance the hen, the partridge,
the francolin, the crested lark, the pheasant; some of the
straight-taloned birds, and such as live on the banks of a
river, in marshes, or by the sea, take a water-bath ; some
birds take both the dust-bath and the water-bath, as for
instance the pigeon and the sparrow ; of the crooked-taloned
5 birds the greater part take neither the one bath nor the other.
So much for the ways of the above-mentioned,—but some
birds have a peculiar habit of making a noise at their hinder
quarters, as, for instance, the turtle-dove;5 and they make
a violent movement of their tails at the same time that
they produce this peculiar sound.
1 Plin. x. 45, xviii. 69. 2 Plin. x. 44. 3 Nauck, fr. 297. For various readings see Schneider and the Aeschylean commentators. The punning line, toitou d' emmirjv eiwna to)v aiimv Kcmon', is of obscure and uncertain meaning. The myth as a whole is subtle, complicated, and doubtless of greater antiquity. On the zoological side, it is based on the similarity of note in the hoopoe and cuckoo, and on the hawk-like appearance of the latter bird. 4 Athen. ix. p. 387. r' Hence Prov. rpvyuvos XnXln-Tepns, Suid.
