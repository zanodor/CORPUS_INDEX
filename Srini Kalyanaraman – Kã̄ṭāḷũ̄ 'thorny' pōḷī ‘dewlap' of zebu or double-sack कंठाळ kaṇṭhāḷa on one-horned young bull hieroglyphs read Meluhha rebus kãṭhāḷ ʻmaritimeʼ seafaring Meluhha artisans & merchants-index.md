-- Association of zebu hieroglyph with kãṭhāḷ ʻmaritimeʼ long-distance trade is signified by the thorny embellishment of the zebu's dewlap on a seal.
"The majestic zebu bull, with its heavy dewlap and wide curving horns is perhaps the most impressive motif found on the Indus seals. Generally carved on large seals with relatively short inscriptions, the zebu motif is found almost exclusively at the largest cities of Mohenjodaro and Harappa.The rarity of zebu seals is curious because the humped bull is a recurring theme in many of the ritual and decorative arts of the Indus region, appearing on painted pottery and as figurines long before the rise of cities and continuing on into later historical times. The zebu bull may symbolize the leader of the herd, whose strength and virility protects the herd and ensures the procreation of the species or it stands for a sacrificial animal. When carved in stone, the zebu bull probably represents the most powerful clan or top officials of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.

Black drongo fork-tiled shrikes perch on grazing animals. This characteristic feature makes them the friends of cattle. This is explained in an extraordinary Telugu expressions: పోలడు ,

The bird is often shown associated with zebu on inscriptions. It is the friend of the zebu guarding its skin from insects and attacking birds. Zebu is pola, celebrated in an annual cattle festival called Pola festival. The word signifies two hieroglyphs; zebu and dewlap:
पोळ
pōḷa m A bull dedicated to the gods, marked with a trident and discus, and set at large. 2 Hence, fig. A fat, lazy, good-for-nothing fellow. 3 f A wall of loose stones. 4 n C (Or पोळें
) A honeycomb. (Marathi). The bird tht perches on the hump or back of the zebu is
called
పోలడు
Rebus rendering is used for the stunning archaeometallurgical invention of
crucible steel which gets its name from this bird: folād P فولاد folād or fūlād
पोलाद
pōlāda n (

Similar celebration of processions is evidenced in the bronze toys of Daimabad with wheels on the toybases, to be drawn in a procession, an utsava bera 'temple procession of pratima to promote barter trade transactions of the artisans' creations.
The seal which has the zebu field symbol shows the dewlap vividly embellished with a thorn or corncob. The dewlap is pōḷī, ‘dewlap' (Marathi) Rebus: pola 'magnetite, ferrite ore'.

Black Drongo
Andaman drongo, Dicrurus andamanensis "Drongo is songbird with glossy black plumage and typically a long forked tail and a crest, found in Africa, southern Asia, and Australia." https://www.lexico.com/definition/drongo
"The black drongo (Dicrurus macrocercus) is a small Asian passerine bird of the drongo family Dicruridae. It is a common resident breeder in much of tropical southern Asia fromsouthwest Iran through India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka east to southern China and Indonesia and accidental visitor of Japan. It is an all black bird with a distinctive forked tail and measures 28 cm (11 in) in length. It feeds on insects,and is common in open agricultural areas and light forest throughout its range, perching conspicuously on a bare perch or along power or telephone lines. The species is known for its aggressive behaviour towards much larger birds, such as crows, never hesitating to divebomb any bird of prey that invades its territory. This behaviour earns it the informal name of king crow. Smaller birds often nest in the well-guarded vicinity of a nesting black drongo...They are aggressive and fearless birds, and although only 28 cm (11 in) in length, they will attack much larger species that enter their nesting territory, including crows and birds of prey. This behaviour led to their former name of king crow. They fly with strong



10
flaps of the wing and are capable of fast manoeuvres that enable them to capture flying insects. With short legs, they sit upright on thorny bushes, bare perches or electricity wires. They may also perch on grazing animals." (Whistler, Hugh (1949). Popular handbook of Indian birds (4th ed.). Gurney and Jackson, London. pp. 155157. )https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_drongo
Spangled drongo (Dicrurus bracteatus)
"The name of the genus combines the Ancient Greek words dikros "forked" and oura "tail". "Drongo" is originally from the indigenous language of Madagascar, where it refers to local species; it is now used for all members of the family.,, Despite their small size, they are aggressive and fearless, and will attack much larger species if their nest or young are threatened...Researchers have considered the possibility that these drongos possess theory of mind, not fully shown in any animal other than humans." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drongo
The best blades are believed to have been forged in Persia from Indian wootz, which was also used to make shields and armor. These steels were known in the middle ages in Russia where they were called “bulat” steels. In Persia, they were known as “pouhad Janherder”.

(Marathi) bulad 'steel, flint and steel for making fire' (Amharic); fUlAd 'steel' (Arabic) pōlāda 'steel', pwlad (Russian), fuladh (Persian) folādī (Pashto) Bulat steel blade of a knife "Bulat is a type of steel alloy known in Russia from medieval times; regularly being mentioned in Russian legends as the material of choice for cold steel. The name булат is a Russian transliteration of the Persian word fulad, meaning steel. This type of steel was used by the armies of nomadic peoples. Bulat steel was the main type of steel used for swords in the armies of Genghis Khan, the great emperor of the Mongolian Empire. The technique used in making wootz steel has been lost for centuries and the bulat steel used today makes use of a more recently developed technique...Carbon steel consists of two components: pure iron, in the form of ferrite, and cementite or iron carbide, a compound of iron and carbon. Cementite is very hard and brittle; its hardness is about 640 by the Brinell hardness test, whereas ferrite is only 200. The amount of the carbon and the cooling regimen determine the crystalline and chemical composition of the final steel. In bulat, the slow cooling process allowed the cementite to precipitate as micro particles in between ferrite crystals and arrange in random patterns. The color of the carbide is dark while steel is grey. This mixture is what leads to the



13
famous patterning of Damascus steel.Cementite is essentially a ceramic, which accounts for the sharpness of the Damascus (and bulat) steel. " https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulat_steel "In the Muslim world of the 9th-12th centuries CE, the production of fuladh, a Persian word, has been described by Al-Kindi, Al-Biruni and AlTarsusi, from narm-ahanand shaburqan, two other Persian words representing iron products obtained by direct reduction of the ore. Ahan means iron. Narm-ahan is a soft iron and shaburqan a harder one or able to be quench-hardened. Old nails and horse-shoes were also used as base for fuladh preparation. It must be noticed that, according to Hammer- Purgstall, there was no Arab word for steel, which explain the use of Persian words. Fuladh prepared by melting in small crucibles can be considered as a steel in our modem classification, due to its properties (hardness, quench hardened ability, etc.). The word fuladh means "the purified" as explained by Al-Kindi. This word can be found as puladh, for instance in Chardin (1711 AD) who called this product; poulad jauherder, acier onde, which means "watering steel", a characteristic of what was called Damascene steel in Europe."
... ‘...’pulad’ of Central Asia. The oasis of Merv where crucible steel was also made by the medieval period lies in this region. The term ‘pulad’ appears in Avesta, the holy book of Zoroastrianism and in a Manicheen text of Chinese Turkestan. There are many variations of this term ranging from the Persian ‘polad’, the Mongolian ‘bolat’ and ‘tchechene’, the Russian ‘bulat’, the Ukrainian and Armenian ‘potovat’, Turkish and Arab ‘fulad’, ‘farlad’ in Urdu and ‘phaulad’ in Hindi. It is this bewildering variety of descriptions that was used in the past that makes a study of this subject so challenging.’ (p.30)
PWLẠD ( پولاد ) > BOLD RUSSIAN (ПОЛАД) ORIGIN: PERSIAN (TĀJĪK) / MONGOLIAN INDO-EUROPEAN > INDO-IRANIAN > INDO-ARYAN
This name derives from the Mongolian (Qalq-a ayalγu) “Bold”, from the Persian (Tājīk) "pwlạd", meaning “steel”. Bolad († 1313), was a Mongol minister of the Yuan Dynasty, and later served in the Ilkhanate as the representative of the Great Khan of the Mongol Empire and cultural adviser to the Ilkhans.

Figure illustrates a drawing of King Puru of India greeting Alexander the Great (about 330 BC).
The centre-piece of the Ranchi Steel Authority of India Institute painting, in my view, is the smithy, forge shown to the left of the Alexander-Puru narrative of gift of a sword.
This painting is in the guest house of the largest R&D steel laboratory in the world, the Steel Authority of Irui@ itsRanchi (with a staff of 1200 research scientists and support personnel). After King Puru was defeated by Alexander the Great in battle, (as shown in the painting), the King gave, as a token of respect, his sword to Alexander, and behind the King, his aide is carrying an additional gift, a gold container within which is a cake of IndLsnwootz. At the time, this steel was more prized than gold!! In a more recent period, the Russian poet, Alexander Pushkin immortalized “bulat” with a similar comparison, when he wrote, in 1830, the following poem [A.C. Pushkin, Vol 1, Udozestvennia Literaturea, Moscow, (1978), p. 229.]:
All is mine, said gold All is mine, said bulat All I can buy, said gold All I will take, said bulat

Rebus: Bolad (alternatively spelled Pulad, Pulat, Polat, or Polad in Persian and Turkic languages) is common given name among the Inner Asian peoples. The meaning of the word Bolad is "steel". In Khalkha Mongolian form of the word is Bold. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolad_(given_name) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_drongo
The word wootz (Michael Faraday, as quoted by Peter Day, The Philosopher's Tree, p. 108) may have been a mistranscription of wook, an anglicised version of urukku (உருக்கு)
(ഉരുക്ക ), the word for melting in Tamil and Malayalam or urukke, the word for steel
in Kannada (ಉು ರ್‍స్ , ಉು ಕ್ಕ ),Telugu (ఉక్కు ) and many other Dravidian languages." http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wootz_steel
What could be the source of the word bulat (Russian)? If the sword was forged from wootz (ukku -- Kannada, Telugu), is it possible that the word bulat was adapted from pola 'magnetite' iron in Asuri (Meluhha) language? Wootz may be derived from utsa 'spring of water' attesting to the watery pattern formed on the wootz (ukku, utsa) steel blade after forging of the crucible steel cake.

Wootz was imported into the Middle East from India. (Jeffrey Wadsworth and Oleg D. Sherby (1980). "On the Bulat – Damascus Steel Revisited". Prog. Mater. Sci. 25 (1): 35–68) "The name булат is a Russian transliteration of the Persian word پپپپپ (transliterated pulad), meaning steel.

hardness test, whereas ferrite is only 200. The amount of the carbon and the cooling regimen determine the crystalline and chemical composition of the final steel. In bulat, the slow cooling process allowed the cementite to precipitate as micro particles in between ferrite crystals and arrange in random patterns. The color of the carbide is dark while steel is grey. This mixture is what leads to the famous patterning of Damascus steel.
Polad, bulat crucible steel
'Schrader gives a list of names for 'steel' related to Pers. pulAd; Syr. pld; Kurd. pila, pola, pulad; Pehl. polAwat; Armen. polovat; Turk. pala; Russ. bulat; Mizdzhegan polad, bolat; Mongol. bolot, bulat, buriat. He is unable to suggest an origin for these words. Fr. Muller pointed out that the Pehlevi and Armenian should be polapat and suggested Greek 'muchbeaten' as the original word...not all the countries of Asia had been exhausted in search for similar names...by adding Tibetan p'olad, Sulu bAlan, Tagalog patalim, Ilocano paslip, we at once see that the origin of the word may lie to the east. Naturally one thinks of China as the possible point of issue, for there steel was known in the third millenium before our era and we have the positive reference to steel in a Chinese writer of the fifth century BCE...Cantonese dialect fo-lim, literally 'fire-sickle'..."(Wiener, Leo, 2002, Contributions toward a history of Arabico-Gothc culture, vol.4, Gorgias Press LLC, pp. xli-xlii)
"...‘pulad’ of Central Asia. The oasis of Merv where crucible steel was also made by the medieval period lies in this region. The term ‘pulad’ appears in Avesta, the holy book of Zorastrianism and in a Manichéen text of Chinese Turkestan. There are many variations of this term ranging from the Persian ‘polad’, the Mongolian ‘bolat’ and ‘tchechene’, the Russian ‘bulat’, the Ukrainian and Armenian ‘potovat’, Turkish and Arab ‘fulad’, ‘farlad’ in Urdu and ‘phaulad’ in Hindi. It is this bewildering variety of descriptions that was used in the past that makes a study of this subject so challenging." https://www.scribd.com/doc/268526061/Wootz-Steel-Indian-Institute-of-Science Wootz Steel, Indian Institute of Science

“The Indian subcontinent has been famous among metallurgists, conservators and archaeologists for its ancient iron-making technological heritage1 . Julef et al. (1996) have highlighted the importance of South Asian iron and steel making technology, particularly in peninsular India during the frst millennium AD2 . Signifcant metallurgical achievements have been made in Indian subcontinent such as the discovery and application of wootz steel (also called “bulad” in Central Asia). [Bronson, B.

“Conclusions In summary, we have investigated the iron manufactured using the traditional iron making process followed by Indian tribes known as ‘Agaria’. Our results clearly demonstrated the importance of analytical techniques operating at various length scale, in proposing the mechanisms of corrosion resistance including other properties of archaeomaterials. We have proposed the hypothesis for the excellent corrosion resistance of Agaria-tribe’s iron. In this article, the role of iron ore’s composition in the formation of corrosion products film (protective film against corrosion) on the iron surface is highlighted. Hematite and maghemite along with slag phases were depicted by using GIXRD and neutron diffraction as the corrosion products on the iron surface. The investigations also highlighted the essential role of a multi-analytical techniques approach in the analysis of archaeomaterials. These findings were identified as the primary reasons for the high corrosion resistance of the iron. Unlike Delhi iron pillar, P (which was found in the iron of Gupta’s period) is not found in the corrosion product layer formed on the iron (irrespective of hammered/un-hammered) manufactured by Agaria tribes within the limit of the correlative analytical techniques that are used in this study. However, the scope of further investigation still prevails. The effect of metal-working operation (followed by Agaria tribes) in making the iron corrosion resistance is also demonstrated. We hypothesize that the metal working operation known as hot hammering, has led to the consolidation of internal pores (which were present in iron before pre-treatment) and removal of inclusions such as slag. Ticker passive corrosion product film, which is known to be protective on the Agaria tribes’ iron, is observed for hammered iron than un-hammered iron. Hence, it is postulated that consolidation of pores, expected removal of inclusions and thick passive corrosion product layer formation have supported the iron in attaining the excellent corrosion resistance. We anticipate that our findings will assist in uncovering the hidden knowledge pertaining to the archeomaterials’ (ferrous) degradation phenomenon, particularly in Japan and the South Asian region’s, with a history of close collaboration in ferrous metallurgy.”
