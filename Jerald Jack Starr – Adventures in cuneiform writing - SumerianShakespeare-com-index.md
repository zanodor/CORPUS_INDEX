Adventures in cuneiform writing
27-35 minutes
Ur-Namma tablet commemorating the building of a temple dedicated
to Nanna (the great ziggurat at Ur). It also announces the building of a
defensive wall for the city.
It all started with a casual remark that I made to my girlfriend, Loring.
We were at the Frist Museum looking at a display of cuneiform tablets. I
said, “Wouldn’t it be great to own one of the tablets? I’d love to own
something so ancient, when writing and civilization were
first invented.” I didn’t give the remark a second thought until two months

later when Loring
gave me a cuneiform “tablet” for my birthday. It had an odd cylindrical
shape with writing down the sides. I didn’t know what it was, neither did
Loring, or the people she bought it from (which is perhaps just as well, if
they had known what it was, she couldn't have afforded it).
After some research, I discovered that it was a Gudean “foundation cone”
from the temple of the war god Ningirsu. Gudea was a Sumerian ruler who
reigned between 2140-2120 B.C. (see Gudea Translation). I was very
happy with my gift. It is more than 4,000 years old, it's part of ancient
history, and it has Gudea’s “autograph”. It became my most prized
possession.

the first readable column on the left.
As almost an afterthought, Loring also gave me a list of hand-drawn
cuneiform signs that she had printed from the Internet. It was just a few
pages, but it gave me the idea that maybe I could learn some of the
Sumerian language. I thought I would write a thank-you note to Loring, in
Sumerian, to show my appreciation for her sweet and thoughtful gift. I
would
draw a few signs on lined notebook paper (that would be clever). Just a
few signs, nothing elaborate; how difficult could it be?
Little did I know what I was getting into.

I soon learned that Sumerian is a very difficult language indeed. Even
the scribes had difficulty writing it. I also learned that it's a “language
isolate”, which means it's not related to any other language in the world,
then or now. It's a collection of 700 complicated signs, most of which have
multiple meanings, made up of several different languages, with very little
clarifying grammar, that was constantly evolving over the course of 2,000
years. Not much is known about the language and even the experts don’t
always agree on it.
It took me long time just to figure out which way was right-side-up on
a tablet (even professional publications sometimes print tablets upside
down or in photographic reverse).
I checked out every book about Sumerian writing and history that I found
at the local library (knowing Sumerian history came in handy when I was
translating The Great Fatted Bull). At night and on week-ends I would
pore through the books with a magnifying glass, trying to decipher the
signs. I became completely obsessed by it. It was all I could think about.
I stopped reading other books. I stopped watching TV. During any lull in
a conversation, my mind drifted back to cuneiform symbols.
I could easily spend all day researching a single word or phrase, and at
night have nothing to show for it. I was spending all my time on it, but I
wasn’t making any progress. Then I discovered this thing called the
Internet. I had once been a computer programmer
(I started on a card-punch, which shows how long ago it was). I got out of
the business and studiously avoided computers ever since. I had never
sent an email or surfed on the web. Two software programs in particular
were very helpful: the ePSD (electronic Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary
(the first time I saw the ePSD, the heavens opened up and the
angels sang)) and the ETCSL (Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian
Literature). The programs are not very user-friendly, but both are
essential for anyone learning the Sumerian language. So in addition to
learning ancient Sumerian, I was also learning modern computers. One
moment I was working on the computer and the next moment I was
writing on clay.
I decided to write the letter on clay, not paper. After learning all these
complicated signs, I wanted to be able to write them on a clay tablet like a
true Sumerian scribe. First I had to figure out how it was done. I started
Adventures in cuneiform writing about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/35901.html
3 of 19 8/18/2020, 5:34 PM



experimenting with different kinds of clay. I soon realized that I had to
find a way to keep the clay moist over a long period of time. It’s not known
exactly how the Sumerians did it, so I had to re-discover for myself the
ancient technique of using plastic wrap and paper towels. I had to design
my own writing stylus, since nobody is quite sure what one looked like. I
cut it to the right size and shape, which I determined by using trial and
error. Most importantly, I had to learn the proper writing technique so the
signs would look authentic. I would write some signs on a clay tablet, then
roll out the tablet to “erase” it, then start all over again. It was actually a
lot of fun. I basically re-invented writing. It was like my own personal
voyage of archeological discovery.
Eventually, I got to be pretty good at it. I could compose my own
sentences, say what I wanted to say, and not just lift phrases from
Sumerian literature and string them together like beads. I could pun in
Sumerian and write in a style that was grammatically correct for the
period of Gudea (nothing "Babylonian" for me, the Babylonians are so
nouveau).
I wanted the tablet ready to be ready for Loring’s birthday. I had time
off from work, so I decided to devote myself full-time to completing the
tablet. I shut myself in my apartment and refused to see anyone or talk to
anyone for three weeks in a row; not friends nor family, not even Loring,
the woman I was doing it for. She was very understanding about it. She
thought it was cool that I was interested in cuneiform writing (everyone
else thought I was being weird). I still had to write the letter, research the
language, do the transliteration, and last but not least, write the tablet. It
would have been easy enough to write out a tablet in my
normal “handwriting”, with all its erasures and its leftward scrawl, but
Loring is a skilled artist, and I wanted the tablet to be “artistic”.
(Cuneiform writing, like Chinese calligraphy, can be quite beautiful, even
if you don’t know a single word it says). I wanted the lettering to be
perfect, with no erasures (you can erase a sign by dampening the dried
clay and then smoothing it over, but it always leaves a noticeable mark). I
was using small print, which required great precision. It was like jeweler’s
work. I had to wear magnifying glasses to do it. If I wanted the tablet to be
perfect, I would need a lot more practice.
My kitchen was like a scribal work shop. It was so cluttered with wood,
Adventures in cuneiform writing about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/35901.html

clay, tools, etc., I could barely get to my stove and refrigerator. I didn’t
have a single hot meal in three weeks. My living room was like a
carpenter’s workshop because I was also making a clay “envelope”
that would open up like jewelry box, in which to store the tablet (this
project just kept getting bigger and bigger). I had never done this kind of
work before, so I was experimenting with different kinds of molds and
construction techniques. For some reason, this project seemed to
require the use of every single tool in my possession – hammers and saws,
sanders and screwdrivers, you name it. My apartment was a complete
wreck. To top everything off, this was happening during a record-breaking
summer heat wave and the central air conditioning in my building was
broken. It got hot enough in the apartment to actually affect the texture
of the clay. I had only one small AC window unit that kept the bedroom
moderately cool.
This is where I did my computer work.
What had started out as a magnificent obsession had now become a
grinding ordeal. I was working 18-20 hours a day. I would wake up after
too little sleep and I would be at work while waiting for my first cup of
coffee to brew.
I wasn’t eating or sleeping. I wasn’t bathing or shaving. My hair was
long, my beard
was long, and my nails were long. I was like Howard Hughes.
It was the last day that I could work on the tablet. Later that afternoon
I had to go to my mother’s house to mow the lawn. The next day I had to
go back to my job. It was as simple as that; I had to return to my normal
life. I had already spent too much time on this project.
During the past several weeks I made four attempts to write the tablet.
Each tablet was better than the last. All of them were “good enough”, but
none of them were what I wanted. They weren’t anywhere near as perfect
as I imagined they would be. This was to be my fifth and final attempt. I
was down to my last bit of clay. I had just enough for one more tablet.
I had one last chance to get it right.
I was extremely irritated (furious, actually) at the way things had
turned out. There I was, after months of effort, at the final hour of the final
day, in a high-stress “do or die” situation. Being rushed and under
pressure was not very conducive to the kind of work I needed to do.

I was also under-slept, and tried to compensate for it by drinking way too
much coffee, which made me feel nervous and jittery. When I tried to
write, I had to use both hands to steady my grip. I was starting to doubt
that I could even finish the tablet, much less do it to my satisfaction. I was
already scaling back my expectations. I decided that if this tablet didn’t
turn out the way I wanted, then I would simply give Loring one of the
other ones. I was sure she’d be happy enough with it, but I was
disappointed that I had gone through so much effort, only to bring forth
such a mediocre result.
Then I stopped writing. I realized it wasn’t all about me.
It wasn’t about my efforts to learn Sumerian or to create a perfect
tablet. It was about
Loring. I suddenly remembered my original intention, which was simply
to thank Loring
for the sweet and thoughtful gift she had given me. I calmed down after
that. I finished
the tablet and had just enough time to bake it in the oven. I took it out of
the oven, and before the tablet had time to cool, I quickly headed out the
door to go mow the lawn.
When I returned later that evening, I headed straight to the tablet. I
looked at it carefully, making sure everything was correct. The signs
sparkled when I moved the tablet around in the light. I was satisfied with
how it looked. It wasn’t perfect, but it was close enough.
The tablet is quite small, it fits easily in the palm of the hand. Its color is a
light golden tan. The tablet is very modest in appearance; to look at it, no
one would ever guess that it represents a thousand hours of my life.
I gave the tablet to Loring. I told her that if I spent all this time doing
Adventures in cuneiform writing about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/35901.html

"paying work",
I could have bought her something really, really nice. She said she’d rather
have the tablet. She said it was her most prized possession. That made
everything worthwhile. We had
given each other our most prized possessions.
So that was the end of my Sumerian adventure. I put away all my
notebooks and my
writing materials. I had a clean apartment again. I had leisure time. I
could do other things,
I could think other thoughts.

Several months passed. I hadn’t done anything Sumerian. One day I
was sitting around with nothing to do. My gaze happened to fall on the

Gudea foundation cone, so I decided to translate it. I had never been
satisfied with the other translations of it. I remembered that the
Library of Congress had a Gudea foundation cone pictured on their
website. They didn’t have a transliteration of it (a transliteration is the
Sumerian signs converted to the Sumerian words, a translation is the
Sumerian words converted into English) so I decided to send them a copy
when I was done.
While on the website I just happened to notice another tablet. I looked
down at the bottom of the page to read the translation. The tablet was
labeled “Not yet translated”.
I looked back at the tablet and realized that it was about Ur-Namma, a
Sumerian king
(see Ur-Namma Translation).
Ur-Namma tablet in the Library of Congress.
Several days later, after I had finished the translations of the Gudea
cone and the
Ur-Namma tablet, I went back to the Library of Congress website. This
time I carefully
scanned all of the tablets. There was a tablet that I saw on my last visit, but
only glanced at.
This time, the first thing I noticed was that it had no numbers at the
beginning of the lines.
About 97% of the tablets are classified as Administrative. They are
accounting records,
such as receipts, ledgers, inventories, and the like. These tablets are
recognizable by the
numbers at the beginning of the lines to record the quantities of items that
are on the list

(5 sheep, 3 goats, 10 bushels of grain, etc.).
This tablet was different. It was one of the 3% of tablets that are
classified as Literature
(history, mythology, proverbs, etc.). This tablet was "all narrative", the
rarest kind of tablet.
I looked down to read the translation. It was labeled “incomprehensible”.
It wasn't just
“not yet translated”, like some other tablets. It was actually labeled
“incomprehensible”,
which means the experts had already looked at it and decided it was
unreadable. I looked
back at the tablet. Someone went through a lot of trouble to fill up both
sides of the tablet.
The writing seemed very “purposeful”. That’s an expression we use at my
job. I work for a
company that scores standardized tests (it’s not as dull as it sounds). I
spend my days
evaluating narratives and I’ve read many papers that were thought to be
incomprehensible.
I decided I would try to translate the tablet.

Tablet #36.
So it all began again, the mania, the obsession. I had some more time
off from work, so I did the same thing that I had done before; I locked
myself in the apartment and dedicated myself full-time to working on the
tablet. It was a very tricky translation. At first, the tablet does seem like a
“word salad”, a jumble of words without any cohesive meaning. I could
understand why someone would think it was gibberish. Here are some of
the challenges that the tablet presented:
1) The missing context (subject) of the story: To put it simply, I had to
know the context of the story in order to read the signs, but I had to read
the signs to know the context!
In the Sumerian language, context is everything. If you know the context
of the writing, then you can eliminate the many alternative meanings of a
Adventures in cuneiform writing about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/35901.html
10 of 19 8/18/2020, 5:34 PM



sign that don't make any sense within the sentences. It's difficult
enough to translate a tablet that has an unknown context; this
tablet has two: bull and king. I know of no other tablet that has two
simultaneous contexts.
2) "Encoding": The scribe deliberately disguised the meaning of the
text, making it difficult (if not impossible) for anyone (ancient or modern)
to read this tablet. But he did leave one important clue, the sign mahX; see
the Transliteration.
3) The lack of clarifying grammar: These are the prefixes and suffixes
that are attached to a word to indicate its meaning and to provide
information about person, number, gender, verb tense, etc. Tablet #36 is
completely devoid of these clarifying "grammar particles". This kind of
writing is called "nonformulaic", and it's much more difficult to translate.
4) The “compressed” writing style: The signs are “folded” back on
themselves to save space on a line. The signs therefore looked very
different from the classic cuneiform script
that I was used to. I had to spend a long time verifying each of these signs
on the ePSD.
This is explained below in greater detail.
5) Wordplay: The hidden and double meanings, along with the
dialogue, made this tablet doubly difficult to translate. In addition, the
scribe throws in some Emesal words, just to keep the reader off balance.
This is what it was like trying to translate this tablet: Imagine
translating a sentence written in a foreign alphabet. The context of the
sentence isn't known. The handwriting is not always legible, and some of
the letters are worn, damaged, or missing. There is no
capitalization, punctuation, or spaces between the words, so it's
impossible to tell where one word ends and another begins. It is just one
long string of letters. Now consider that each letter may be just a letter,
part of a larger word, or it is a whole word by itself. In this way
even a simple word like “cat” can have multiple permutations (e.g., c-a-t, C
a-t, c-a T, C A T, etc.). As if that weren’t hard enough, each letter has
multiple meanings! Each letter can stand for several, or more than a
dozen different things, with different pronunciations! I swear,
it’s enough to drive a man insane.

KA: It can mean kag mouth; dug4 speak; gu3 voice; inim
word; kir4 hyena (!); kiri3 nose; zu2 tooth; or zuh steal. KA also has
many other definitions and it's known by many other sign names. Or it
may mean none of these things. It may just be part of a multi-sign word,
or it may be just a syllable that sounds like ka. Because of these multiple
meanings, I dread seeing this symbol on any line of cuneiform that
I am trying to translate. So of course it shows up a lot on this tablet; a total
of ten times; and it's used in six different ways.
I spent hours and hours and hours just looking at the tablet, or
working on the computer. I would think I translated a key phrase, only to
have it fall apart in the next sentence. I had to change my mind a hundred
times about this tablet as I eliminated one possible translation
after another. I would go to bed at night elated over the progress I had
made, only to wake up the next morning filled with doubt. I also had to
deal with numerous computer problems. My friends had given me their
old computers to replace my Stone Age Tandy 1000. Each of the
computers broke down in turn. At one time I had four different computers
in my apartment, with none of them working. I finally had to go buy a new
one. I didn’t care about the cost, nothing was allowed to get in the way of
my singled-minded pursuit of the translation. I was busy night and day.
Many times I thought about quitting, but I pressed on, like a man
possessed.
One day I was shocked by my reflection in the mirror. I had lost
weight, my skin was pale, and I had dark circles under my eyes. My hair
was wild and I hadn’t shaven in a week. I once again was Howard Hughes.

Compressed signs are the equivalent of modern "cursive writing".
Even if you can read normal cuneiform writing, it doesn't mean you can
read compressed signs, in the same way that knowing how to read printed
letters doesn't mean you can read cursive writing..
One of the things that gave me great difficulty was the compressed
signs. To tell the truth, I didn't even know such things existed. When I was
writing my own tablet, I had limited my research to tablets dated no later
than Lagash II, so that my tablet would be "Gudean", and therefore strictly
Sumerian. Compressed signs were not commonly used until the
following Ur III time period. I thought I knew the signs well enough. I had
Adventures in cuneiform writing about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/35901.html
13 of 19 8/18/2020, 5:34 PM



not memorized all of them, but I knew if I had seen a sign before and I
knew how to look it up (I'd start with the sign a on the PSD sign list, then
flip through all 700 signs, until I reached the sign zur). When I first saw
Tablet #36, I was thinking, "What the. . .?" Since the PSD sign list doesn't
show compressed signs, I had no way of knowing the definition of the
sign, even though it may represent a "normal" sign that I already knew. It
was like trying to find a word in the dictionary when you don't know how
the word is spelled or even how it is pronounced.
I usually found one of these signs when looking for something else. I
would be checking
on one sign, and amidst a hundred other complicated signs on a tablet, my
eye would
instantly be drawn to one of the compressed signs that I had been looking
for. I was able
to do this because my mind was so thoroughly attuned to cuneiform
symbols.
Other people, who are more learned or intelligent than I am, could have
found an easier
way to do it, but I was able to do it only by being completely obsessed with
the translation.
Tablet #36 was especially challenging in terms of "sign recognition" (as it's
officially called)
so I'm particularly proud of my efforts in this regard.

There was an occasion that illustrates the hallucinatory nature of this
tablet and the importance of context in Sumerian writing. I was about half
way through the translation. I had figured out the bull context of the story,
so I was starting to understand the many references to grain that I had
been seeing. I was thinking that the tablet might be a "Ferdinand the Bull"
kind of story. Ferdinand the Bull is a cartoon character that is strong and
stubborn, but also very gentle. I was trying to translate line o15. There was
the sign (bad3) that means "wall", like the kind of wall that goes around a
city, so I was thinking of a "corral" or a "bull pen". There was another sign
(geme2) that means "a female servant". The sign was written twice
in a row, meaning it's plural, so I figured it was young servant girls
because they were there with their brother. There was also the sign for
"hand" and another meaning "to drag". I could picture the scene perfectly
in my mind, with the sisters and their brother comically trying to
drag a young bull into his pen. It was like a scene painted by a Sumerian
Adventures in cuneiform writing about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/35901.html
15 of 19 8/18/2020, 5:34 PM



Norman Rockwell. Later on, after I had figured out the Big Bad King
context of the story, I was able to translate line o15 correctly: That's not a
wall, it's a fortress (bad3: wall, fortress), and those aren't
servant girls, they're slave women (geme2: a female servant or slave -
If they are hired, they are servants; if they're taken in war, they are
slaves). And it wasn't the brother who was dragging the bull, it was the
other way around!
Like I said: in Sumerian, context is everything.
Which brings us to mahX, the secret context of the story. As
mentioned in the preceding paragraph, I had already figured out the “bull”
context of the story, but I wasn’t making any great progress on translating
the rest of the tablet. Usually, when the context of a tablet is
known, it is “easy enough" to translate the story completely. Even though I
couldn’t translate the rest of the writing, I could tell that it didn’t have
anything to do with a barnyard bull. Early in the translation, I had seen
that mah2 (which usually means ”dairy cow”) was used as an
alternative sign for mah (meaning “great”). I wish I could say that it was a
“Eureeka!” moment and that the tablet was suddenly made clear to me.
The fact is, I didn’t think I could use the sign in this way. It was used only
once in the 2,000 year history recorded on the ePSD, it was in the wrong
time period, and it was probably a “scribal error” (to use a sign definition
in a translation, it is necessary to show that it was used on tablets of the
same time-period and in the same context). Since the usual definition of
the sign mah2 is “cow” (it's used in this way 1,000 times on the ePSD), I
did what any ancient Sumerian or any modern Sumerologist
would have done, I discarded the sign as “nonsensical”. Finally, out of
sheer desperation, I thought, “Okay, wonder if mah2 really does mean
mah?” Although I was still having some difficulty translating the
sentences, at least they were no longer so ridiculously nonsensical.
One day, it finally occurred to me; I thought, “lu-mah [which I suspected
was the name of the protagonist of the story] literally means 'man-great',
and lu-gal (king) also literally means “man‐great”; I wonder if there's a
king in this story?" (at the time I didn’t realize that the bull and the king
were one and the same). After that, I started making real progress in the
translation. I still had a long way to go, but at least I knew what the story
was about; I knew what I was “reading to”. In this way, I was able to
discard all the definitions of the signs that didn’t fit the "king" context of
Adventures in cuneiform writing about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/35901.html

the story, and I could focus only on the ones that might actually
make some sense.
Gradually the tablet became clearer to me. It was like doing a
crossword puzzle (albeit a giant three-dimensional crossword puzzle,
given the fact that every sign has multiple meanings). At first it was
difficult to fill in even a few words, but the more words I got right,
the easier it became to fill in the others. When I first started the
translation, I would be perfectly happy if it turned out to be a chatty letter
between friends. Little did I realize that I would find soon myself in the
bizarro world of the Great Fatted Bull, with lords and ladies,
shepherds and slave women, in a Sumerian court filled with violence and
palace intrigue, where nobody is who they pretend to be. The more I read
the tablet, the more I realized what a great story it is. I would correctly
translate a passage, then doubt myself because
it was too funny, or too wild, or just too good to be true. It was like that for
every single line. Despite all of my protests about what an ordeal
it was, I really enjoyed doing this translation. It was a lot of fun. It was like
being let in on a really good joke, a little at a time.
Eventually I finished the translation. I have to admit, I was very proud
of myself. Not only
had I taught myself ancient Sumerian, but I learned it well enough to
translate a tablet that could have stumped even the most experienced
Sumerologist. To translate even a simple
administrative tablet would have been a major accomplishment for an
amateur like me, and I had translated a literary tablet, which is much
more difficult. Not only that, I had translated a literary tablet with an
unknown context. Not only that, I had translated a "non-formulaic"
literary tablet with two unknown contexts. Not to mention the fact that it
was written in compressed print, and it was deliberately encoded so that
even another Sumerian could not easily read it. I sent a copy of my
translation to the Library of Congress. I wrote to them,
all excited; “Great news!” I was saying, “Of great historical
importance!” “A masterpiece!” After a couple of weeks I got a laconic reply
that said they're currently rebuilding their website and that it would be
ready in the spring. That was all. It seemed to be a polite way of saying
“Thank you for your interest, drop dead.” I haven’t heard from them since.
Perhaps they are working on their own translation.

I was very disappointed. I had spent hundreds of hours and a couple of
thousand dollars working on this tablet. All I wanted from this was to have
my name associated with this tablet in the Library of Congress forever. I
guess that’s not going to happen, so I’ll just have to get over it. I do have
the satisfaction of knowing I was the first person in 4,000 years to read
this tablet. I also made several new friends along the way. Me and Gudea,
me and Ur-Nammu, we’re big buddies now (because of the translations I
did for them). But first and foremost is a nameless scribe who lived so long
ago. I always felt that we were kindred spirits. I knew I had done right by
him the first time I heard someone laugh out loud when reading his story,
after more than 4,000 years. That made everything worthwhile.
Note:
I have since received a nice letter from the Library of Congress,
acknowledging the receipt of my translation and thanking me for the
trouble I had gone through. So apparently the game is still afoot. I will
post any developments as they occur.
December 15, 2008
I recently sent a copy of my translation to several prominent
Sumerologists. I eagerly awaited their reply. For several days I didn’t hear
anything. I wasn’t too surprised at the delay. I assumed they were carefully
checking my translation. I was nobody they had ever heard of,
and I had sent them a translation unlike anything they had ever seen. So if
they were somewhat skeptical, then I could hardly say I blame them. After
several more days, I heard it through the grapevine (email) that a couple
of Sumerologists disagreed with my translation. When I read this, I just
sat there for a moment, filled with happiness.
I was happy because no one had claimed my translation. During the
long ordeal of translating this tablet, I had often worried that someone
else had already translated it. I was also relieved that no one had declared
“The Great Fatted Bull” to be a copy of a known work. In either case, it
would have meant that I had gone through a lot of trouble for nothing.
Until that day, December 7, 2008, I could only hope that I was the first
person in 4,000 years to read this tablet. After that day, I was sure.

translation of Tablet #36.
January 17, 2014:
The CDLI has accepted my transliteration for Tablet #36. The CDLI
(Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative) at UCLA, in association with the
University of Oxford and the Max Planck Institute, is the central authority
for cuneiform studies in the world. On the CDLI page for
Tablet #36, sumerianshakespeare is listed as the Secondary Publication.
That's because Primary Publication is reserved for works originally
printed in scholary publications that are subject to peer review. As an
amateur, I am not eligible for peer review. Nonetheless, it is a
rare distinction for the CDLI to credit the work of an amateur
Sumerologist.
