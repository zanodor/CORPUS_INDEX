DEDICATION
This thesis is dedicated to all men and women who have contributed to the
knowledge of astronomy and astrology with the noble aim of enlightening us
for a better life on this planet and for the progress and upliftment of civilization
from the dawn of time to eternity.
“Thank You So Much” in Billions
My parents and guardians forced me to study and taught me the value of
Education. They are not here to see this good work. I pray that the billions of
stars in the firmaments radiate my deep gratitude to them. Despite this, Oh
Divine Light, I am indebted to them eternally. May their souls rest in peace in
your eternal abode of joy, peace, happiness and everlasting life.

Certification
TO WHOMSOEVER IT MAY CONCERN
This is to certify that Prof. Anthony Writer has completed his research study on “The Use of Fixed Stars in Astrology”, based on the Sayana (Tropical) System, for a diploma in Jyotisha Visharada of the Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. This is an in-depth study divided into two parts. Part one throws light on the knowledge gathered and theories propounded on the Fixed Stars by various authorities since the dawn of civilization till the current period. It also throws light on the use of fixed stars in astrology in interpreting the birth chart as times change. Part two covers case studies of celebrated personalities and the persons known to him.
The case studies of persons known to him have spanned a period of nearly a decade as events had to be monitored by him. The preparation and completion of this thesis took a period of 3 years under my guidance. As Prof. Writer used to seek guidance from me in the Tropical (Sayana) System over the years, I have no hesitation in stating that this thesis is his own work and all the case studies have been developed and written by him. It is my earnest endeavour and cherished dream to champion the cause of research in astrology. I am confident that this thesis will be a source of inspiration to all students and lovers of astrology.

MY GUIDE: PRINCIPAL PROF. JINABHAI LAD
A star on the Mount of Jupiter promises position and status in career and society.
Principal Prof. Jinabhai Lad who started his career in life as an Accountant in a private firm , retired from service as the Managing Director of the company.
His passion for Astrology made him study the subject at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan.
In addition to teching Astrology for the last 32 yers, he carried out the duties of the Secretary and Treasurer of the Bombay Astrological Society and it was during his tenure that the Bombay Astrological Society merged with the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan.
From June 1999 he ws appointed as the Principal of Jyotisha Bharati of the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai.
As a teacher, with a keen and introspective mind, he has specialized in interpretation of natal charts in the Sayana (Tropical), Nirayana (Sidereal or Hindu Astrology) and the Paribhraman Padhathi. At the same time he has encouraged and guided students to use these systems in practical application.
He has re-edited a book “Practical Astrology”, in Gujarati, which was out of print. He has furnished additional information on “The Fixed Stars”, Navamsha, Esoteric Astrology and Paribhraman Padathi. The book has become a standard text for the Jyotirvid Course.

CO-PRINCIPAL PROF. GUSHTASP BEHRAMJI FORBES
Prof. Forbes, after completing his commerce graduation studied for the Chartered Accountancy course. After completing this successfully, he also persued the course of Company Secretary and joined service with Tata.
Prof. Fobres was interested in astrology since 1965 but took up the systematic study in the Bombay Astrological Society in 1981 and completed his JYOTIRVID in 1982, standing First class First and was awarded the Gold Medal. His guru, late Shri Gopalkrishna D. Mody then told him to take charge and establish English Medium classes. He did this on an “experimental” basis in 1983 and regular English medium classes commenced from 1984. He simultaneously studied the K.P. System of Astrology, and stood first.
Prof. Forbes has consistantly followed the footsteps of his guru and mostly prefers to “read” SAYANA CHARTS, though he is equally comfortable with Nirayana charts if need be.
Prof. Forbes has written two books on Astology: 1) “Basic Text Bok of Astrology” for first year students 2) “Advanced Text Book of Astrology” for second year students of Jyotirvid.
Both the books are written, keeping in mind the exhaustive syllabus of Jyotisha Bharati. He is in the process of coming out with his third study: “Essays in Astrology”, which will mostly cater to the students of Jyotisha Visharada. In fact, parts or this work is already being given to students as reference notes. One of the essays deals exhaustively on Fixed Stars and their effects.
Presently, Prof. Forbes is the Co-Principal of Jyotisha Bharati and teaches both the Gujarati as well as English medium students.

PROF. DAULATSINGH THAKUR
Prof. Daulatsingh, son of Shri Vithalsingh Thakur was born in 1924.
After passing Inter Science, he joined the “Ayurvedacharya with Medicine and Surgery” Course at the Baneras Hindu University, a six-year degree course. After studying for 3 years, he was forced to stop his further studies due to unforeseen and unavoidable circumstances, coinciding with the ill-health of his father and the closure of the college for six months due to the “Quit India” movement.
He then joined the Reserve Bank of India and retired as a senior officer in October 1982.
His inquiring and searching mind to know “What Astrology Is and What It Is Not” attracted him towards the Study of Astrology in 1968 and 1969. During the two-year study at the Bombay Astrological Society he concentrated more on reading the Book and Magazines which are stocked in the Library and developed “Academic Interest” in the Celestial subject, which he continues till date.

FOREWORD
The use of fixed stars has not been explored and used much in natal astrology for the following reasons:
1. Due to the fatalistic interpretations given from time immemorial, the subject has not aroused keen interest.
2. For historical and intellectual reasons, backed by the judiciary of the times, the study of astrology and the fixed stars suffered much set back.
3. For many centuries due to lack of transparency in communication and nonavailability of literature with easy access on the subject, the utility of this subject with a rich heritage was lacking.
4. Changes with the pattern of life and a lack of scientific temperament also stalled the progressive use of fixed stars in astrological interpreations.
The main reasons to select this topic on “The Use of Fixed Stars in Astrology” as a subject for the thesis written by Mr. A. S. Writer are :
1. To make attempts to bring in a scientific temperament on the subject.
2. To link the subject from the times of the Aryans, the propogators of the knowledge of the cosmos, the planets and the stars and their related phenomena to the ancient civilizations, on of which is India, that is Bharat, apart from knowing the philosophicl thoughts of those times.
3. To make attempts to show the authenticity of the knowledge used in the interpretations of the fixed stars on the lives of human beings. The case studies are divided into two sections: 1)Celebrated case studies; and 2)Case studies of persons whom he has met personally for a continuous period and noted the events in their lives.
After burning the midnight oil for many years together, to collect and go through the litereature which is not available so easily on this subject, Mr. Writer has done justice to his work and provided ample material and case studies to enable interested and serious students to use it for further study and research.
My experience tells me tht the study and application of the fixed stars along with the natal chart in its totality will enable astrologers to give a new dimension and direction for the betterment of the lives of the common man, so that they could be assisted to acquire the right attitude in times of crises, improve their living status and grow in spiritual knowledge, as was the main aim of our great ancestors who have handed over the message of the stars to us.

PROLOGUE
“And God manifests Himself in many ways” Khalil Gibran
Predictive Astrology is indeed a very hazardous task and perfection in this field is indeed illusory. My Guru, late Shri Gopalbhai D. Mody used to say that in astrology, you have to go from known to the unknown. The Natal Chart before you is the only thing “known” to you. And with a view to reach the “unknown”, an astrologer has to be very familiar with all the tools he needs to use. But for doing this, the absolute necessity is an accurate, casting of the Natal Chart. An accurate, Spashta Bhava Chalit Chart is a MUST. It is precisely for this reason, that we place so much importance and stress on Kundali Ganit in our curriculum.
Your prediction can be just as good as the accuracy of the Chart. And in no other field of astrology is this more relevant than in the use of Fixed Stars in predictive astrology. A reference to the fairly exhaustive list of such Stars are given in this thesis and you will observe that often there are 3 to 6 Fixed Stars situated in just 1` of the Arc of the Zodiac. It is said that a difference of 4 minutes in the recorded time of birth results in 1` difference of the Cusps. Hence, it will be realized that immense accuracy will be needed to arrive at the appropriate assessment of the results of these Fixed Stars. ~
But this not all. There are many pitfalls in predictive astrology, especially when following the Fixed Star route for analysis. Let us evaluate them serially.
FIRSTLY, the general rule is that Fixed Stars are concerned only or mainly with Conjunctions, either with planets or Points (Parts) or Cusps. However, experience shows that in certain cases, even other aspectual patterns merit attention. More particularly and most avoided is the Parallel aspects in astrological analysis of Fixed Stars. Students are requested to bear this in mind always.
SECONDLY, it is said that the normal Orbs of Fixed Stars is just 1` of the Arc of the Zodiac. But as we have seen above, there are often 4`to 6` or even more Stars within a degree of the Zodiac. And these may be of varying result. Hence the stress on accuracy of casting a Horoscope. To add to the confusion, some very few Stars have an Orb ranging from 4 to 7 such as Regulas (Magha) at the tail of Leo and Formalhaut at the commencement of Pisces. These niceties need to be taken care of for a balanced assessment of the Chart.
THIRDLY, the Ancient Masters have identified each Fixed Star with Magnitudes ranging from 1 to 16. In other words, Stars of the First Magnitude are the brightest as seen from the Earth and then receding in brightness so that the Sixteenth Magnitude Stars are the faintest. Mercifully, for predictive astrology, we take into account Stars of the first four Magnitudes only.
FOURTHLY, the Fixed Stars are allocated the Nature of different Planets. This of course, is not done at random. The nature of these Planets indicate and reflect their own Nature to the Stars. Normally, where two or more are known to lend their nature to the same Fixed Star, the one which is placed first is know to be of Primary influence while the second and subsequent Planets are only considered to be imparting their Secondary Nature. FIFTHLY, it will be observed that the Fixed Stars are broadly divided into certain groups, such as friendly or evil Star groups, violent in effect, Stars affecting the eyes or causing deformities in body, etc.



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 14 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
SIXTHLY, even the details of the Declinations and latitudes of the Stars are important considerations in order to experience the effects of the Fixed Stars. Spica (Chitra) is considered to be the most auspicious of the Fixed Stars, but it has South Declination and hence can be of very little use to the native of Northern Hemisphere. This should never be lost sight of. Lastly, interpretations of Stars should never be taken literally but should be applied according to the conditions in which he lives or as per the placement in the individual Chart. For example, Caput Algol is considered to be the worst of all the Fixed Stars in its effects. Normally, it is said to give physical blindness in certain placements as with the Ascendant, sun or Moon. But if it is placed on the Tenth Cusp, then instead of physical blindness, it can make the native blind to the situation in which he is place (karma blind) as the Tenth house represents Karma.
Now, let us refer to the Nirayana and the Sayana systems as far as this branch of astrology goes.
The Nirayana system (Hindus Astrology) divides the Zodiac of 360` into 27 equal parts, so that each part is of 13 20’ duration, which is known as Nakshatra. Each Nakshatra is further sub divided into fourparts called as “Padas” or “Charanas”, each measuring 3 20’ duration and coinciding with a Navamsa. Each Nakshatra is ruled by a Planet and each Pada is also ruled by different planets.
These nakshatras are made up of one or even thousands of Stars. But each Nakshatra has one or more “YOGA TARA” which we call as Fixed Star in Sayana system. These so called “Fixed” Stars also have some motion, howsoever insignificant these may be. Such Stars may have a motion of say as little as 0’50” and thus need many years to move just 1 of the Zodiac. Hence they are considered as Fixed.
Conclusion:
From the very elementary but nevertheless, extremely important exposition of Fixed Stars given above, the student must have realized that what we know is merely, or rather, not even the proverbial tip of the iceberg. Much devotion and determined meditation, accompanied by incessant research, with an open mind, without any pre-conceived bias alone will reveal the hidden esoteric meanings of Nature. However, a precondition to enter this vast ocean of knowledge is extreme humility, with no place for ego at all, in the pursuit of Divine Truth.
I have gone through the entire thesis of Prof. Anthony Writer twice over. On your part when you study this painstaking research thesis yourself, you will realize that only the Planets but even Fixed Stars affect life on Earth. The cae studies given in this thesis is the practical application of vast theory that precedes them. Each one of these case studies need to be studies and understood and then applied by yourself to new charts that may pass your hand.
I congratulate Prof. Writer on his very painstaking accomplishment, on a subject which most would like to avoid at all cost, and have no reservation in suggesting that this thesis be recommended by the Executive Committee of Jyotisha Bharati as a standard Text Book for the advanced students of Jyotisha Visharada Course.

THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 15 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
Date”30th March 2005
PREFACE
After discussing with various knowledgeable persons in the field of astrology, I am given to understand that the study of the fixed stars is not at all popular, moresoever in India, with the vast majority of astrologers and lovers of astrology. Many of the knowledgeable scholars have not made attempts to utilize this knowledge in the interpretation of charts for various reasons known to them only. Some of the reasons are as follows :
There is very scant literature and that too is not easily accessable to the interested readers. The literature available is at times terrifying and it is the normal nature of the human mind to shun away from fear and take solace in easy and light topics of astrology.
The application of fixed stars for interpreatation of events from the natal chart needs the mind to be trained and accustomed to the rigours of a correct degreecal chart. Though degreecal charts are available through various software programmes, by force of habit we tend to skip what the degrees of the zodiac means and slip into the the ocean of light literature and mythology. This has created an atmosphere of striving for progress and success with very little discipline and hard work.
Non-availability of latest material, which is mostly written and published in the West cannot be purchased due to the cost factor. Even related software programmes become very costly.
The serious Indian student has to spend a lot of time in travelling to and fro from home to office and back, that too in congested transport systems. This consumes a lot of time and energy and by the end of a long day, he is totally fagged out. Hence, very little time is available for study and research.
Taking the above points into consideration in a generally frustrating and hectic environment that demotivates students with vacillating minds, I have attempted the following :
To make available as much material available in this study of fixed stars and related topics such as constellations, the people who contributed to its study from ancient times, quotations, illustrations, etc., just to make it comprehensive.
Wherever possible, the names of the authors, articles and books have been mentioned. The thesis attempts to link the thought processes of the ancient civilizations to modern interpretations.
The method used for interpretation is that the natal chart degreecally cast is foundation, and the degrees on the angles, cusps, luminaries and planets falling on the fixed stars are taken into consideration with an orb one degree generally. There is some flexibility of the orb for



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 16 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
the angles, the luminaries in relation to important fixed stars of 1st magnitude. In such cases they extend to 2 1⁄2 degrees orb on either side. This flexibility is permitted due to experience of results obtained from my study over the years.
The characteristics, interpretation, etc. is exhaustive at many places for the sole reason that information is readily available to the readers not accustomed to the study of fixed stars.
Further to this, information on the fixed stars is given in Part III, in alphabetic order. The material is taken from the website of Anne Wright, who gives both the positive and negative sides of the effect of the fixed stars.
Attempts have been made to avoid negative points of the fixed star as far as possible, with my firm belief that: “Character is Destiny”. The native can suppress the negative points that affect his character and destiny and highlight and work on the positive one, thereby transforming himself completely. Our sages have said that through yoga and tapasya one can change the course of destiny. In the modern world any person who spends years (day in and day out) to study a subject, sacrificing everything, is also undergoing penance. By such a sacrifice he has moved away from the path of worldly attractions.
If such negative points have at all been stressed, then it is only with a view of caution and that they could be avoided by the native for his/her interest. No astrologer should pinpoint negative traits when there are good points for development.
This method can only give hope and optimism to the common man, who is already confused and feels let down due to the changing times and stress of modern life. Part III gives both the good and bad interpretations of the fixed stars and the reader can easily have access to it and come to his/her own conclusion.
The simple method used in the thesis backed by the vast information from various sites, articles and books, reference of which is given in the bibliography could be a beginning in research and exploration of this complicated subject of fixed stars.
The thesis is divided into two sections:
1. Part I deals with the information and theories in astrology and the fixed stars since the dawn of ancient civilizations. Attempts have been made to incorporate information and thought a very simple manner.
2. Part II deals with case studies divided into two sections processes from different astronomers and astrologers in:
a) Case studies of celebrities
b) Case studies of persons known to me and whose events in life have been witnessed and recorded by me (real names are not mentioned due to the ethics binding us by the code of secrecy).



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 17 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
It should be remembered that fixed stars cannot be used for chart interpretion in isolation. The astrologer should take into account all the other points like signs, elements, triplicities, quadruplicities, planets, the degrees of the zodiac, the harmonics, etc. while using the knowledge of the fixed star for chart interpretations. The case studies make the above points clear. Further, I only hope that interested readers and serious students will make use of it for application in chart reading because attempts have been made to use fixed stars in progression and transits in the case studies. With so many changes all around in our lives related to artifacts, socifacts and mentifacts affecting us so swiftly and suddenly and taking us unaware, it is necessary for us to do continuous research and give relevant interpretations related to the lives and events of our times. The scriptures say: Change is ever present and is the order of the universe. Today change is inevitable. To make the study of astrology and the fixed stars simple and relevant to modern civilization, it is also necessary to suitably bring about a change in the interpretations of the fixed stars, with a message of hope to all of us. Psychologists tell us that happiness is a state of mind and to persons who have not reached a stage of higher consciousness and spiritual level, the word ‘happiness’ will only denote material attainment and other gratifications. The wise man has said “Happiness is an occasional episode in this vast drama of pains”
By training our minds with these skills and techniques, we will be able to point out such happy occasions and at the same time suggest remedies to the common man for their spiritual elevtion. It is rather difficult, but from my experience it not impossible. People referred to in my case studies have improved quite remarkably, but over a period of time. There are many cases which are not mentioned by me (as my lips are bound by total secrecy) where remedies were suggested but they were just like touching the tip of an iceberg and it took a long time for them even to accept them. From my experience I feel that we should not be frustrated and learn the virtue of Saturnine Patience and Jupiterian Optimism. Overcoming harships and finding opportunities of covert adverse situations to positive results can only prove that we possess such qualities.
Despite unceasing efforts to be comprehensive, no research is fool proof. For all the shortcomings, errors of omission and commission in this study, I am solely responsible.
I wish the readers happy reading so that the study of the fixed stars becomes popular from its point of utility and positive results, thereby bringing in the beneficial message of the stars for a better and healthier life for all us.
A. S. Writer

THE SCOPE OF THE THESIS
The thesis on “The Use of Fixed stars in Astrology” is an attempt to show the influence of the fixed stars on the life of a native, when they are in conjunction, opposition, or parallel aspects with a planet or significant point in the horoscope. The gravity of their influence is felt more when they are on the Ascendant, Culmination or Angles, or near the Sun or Moon at birth. Attempts will be made to show their influence on the angles and cusps when directed.
By looking into the vast vault of the heavens it is my desire to rediscover, analyze, test and employ this great heritage of star knowledge with a fond hope that it could encourage others to revive its study for the betterment of the race.
It is true that fixed stars are not progressed or arced. However they do process forward in the zodiac, thereby giving the energy field of that planet a superimposed profile and bring changes into the life corresponding to the influences of the particular star.
As literature and relevant material is scarce and not readily available, it is my endeavour to incorporate large data so that it is available in one set. Further, theories propounded by different authors will also be touched upon, so that they could be of help in analyzing and interpreting the charts.
The thesis incorporates case studies of celebrated personalities and people known to me. The case studies of people known to me are very important because events in their lives have been witnessed and recorded by me. Due to the ethics of the code of secrecy, neither their names nor many of their life events are revealed.
Attempts have also been made to link the study of fixed stars from ancient times to the modern. This is with a view to expose to the readers that the interpretations of the fixed stars should be adapted to the changing environment times, especially at a time when the precision of the equinox is in the magnetic orb of Aquarius, the sign that signifies science, intellect and detached knowledge. The history of mankind never witnessed so much of new knowledge in science and technology and industrial revolutions as in the last 150 years when the precision of the equinox gradually shifted from the eight to the sixth degree of Pisces. This has brought in inexorable and irresistible change and society is in a very fluid stage.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
“Institutions are shadows of great men” Thomas Carlyle
Remembering persons with fondness and deep gratitude
It was in 1989, when I was in constant touch with the late Prof. Gopal D. Mody, the then Principal of the Bombay Astrological Society and later on the Jyotisha Bharati of the Bharatya Vidya Bhavan, he knew that I was getting curious about the study of the Fixed Stars. In his typical style, Mr. Mody would either introduce a subject in astrology or a book of importance, make us curious to such an extent that we would feel that the onus of acquiring knowledge or reading the book lies with us. This great style of enlightenment fired my imagination and I started my search of the heavens linked to the affairs of men and women.
Prof. Jinabhai Lad and the present thesis: From 1994 onwards, I started applying the knowledge of fixed stars in the charts of men and women and took the guidance of Prof. Jinahbhai Lad. I had easy entry to his house with my problems in astrology. He has been kind enough to entertain me at odd hours and give solutions to my queries in the most satisfying and convincing manner. It was due to his suggestion that I took up this task of writing the present thesis under his guidance.
Prof. G. B. Forbes and the present thesis : The great professor of Harward said that men use only 10 per cent of their memory. Caught in a maze of problems created by my life style and passion of studying astrology from various sources, the study of Fixed Stars were again introduced in the second year Jyotirvid and taught by Prof. G. B. Forbes, the Co-Principal of Jyotisha Bharati. He was kind enough to accede to my request to permit me take classes on Natal Astrolgy, which included the fixed Stars and aspects, for 1st year Jyoisha Visharadha in 2003. Further, Prof. Forbes has been very kind by sparing his valuable time in correcting both the theory in part I and case studies in Part II of this thesis twice, paragraph by paragraph, sentence by sentence, word by word, syllable by syllable, punctuation by punctuation, apart from all the suggestions of alignment and indexing. His hard work and suggestions has made this thesis appealing and presentable with a high quality and standard.
The quest for knowledge on fixed stars was further accelerated when Prof. D.V. Thakur, who presented me a copy of "The Fixed Stars and Constellations in Astrology" by Vivian E. Robson, as a token of appreciation for typing his two books on Kundali Ganit and Sayana I. I strongly feel that Prof. Thakur had the intuition long back that I was destined to do this study on fixed stars. His deep insight of Tropical and Sidereal Astrology has enriched my knowledge.
When I quote Thomas Carlyle, I remember one of his heroes, Samuel Johnson, who used to say :”the business of life is to go forward”. It is heartening to note that all these professors at Jyotisha Bharati are great men in this respect. They have sacrificed much of their time, money and energy and invested their sweat, blood and toil in pursuit of knowledge and finding out various methods to impart it to the students. I acknowledge my deep gratitude

M. Sompura, Prof. Sharad C. Joshi, Prof. D.V. Thakur, the Late Dr. Ramanlal Nayak, Prof. Sukdev Purani, Dr. Nitin Gala, Prof. Dolly Kothari, Prof. Rajesh Kacha, Prof. S. S. Pandit and Prof. Anshu Goil.
While speaking of Jyotisha Bharati, I would fail in my duty if I do not express my deep gratitude to prof. Sharad C. Joshi, for going out of the way in solving my queries on Krishnamuthi Padathi even during very late hours, and that too on the telephone, when I was given the opportunity to teach K. P. fundamentals in 2001 and 2002. His research-oriented method of teaching is a great inspiration to me. He has written many books on the theory of Krishnamurti Padathi with case studies and is a guide to many students who have been engaged in research projects in Krishanmurti Padathi.
The man who moulded me with an inquiring and research-oriented mind is the late Dr. Rashmi Mayur, the Urban and Environmental Scientist, He trained me to speak and write and I always was a part of his research team. Two important projects are : 1) “The Flight of Talented Personnel from Developing Nations to Developed Nations” – a project for the United Nations in 1973. 2) “Crime, Violence and Tension” – a project for the Home Ministry of India in 1975.
The late Mr. KBS Mani, fondly called Mani Anna for teaching me the Krishnamurti Padathi with Raphel’s Table of Houses, Mahabala’s Ephemeris and manual calculation. Despite his impoverished condition (of which I was note fully aware of at that time) he took very good care of me and made me feel at home all the time.
A friend in need is a friend in deed : deep gratitude to the the persons who have helped me
Mr. Norman D’souza, Vice-president of Silverline Technologies Inc. and senior financial management consultant in New York, has been sending me material needed for my study at instant notice. I will cherish his friendship and the timely assistance for ever.
Mr. Surendranath Mane, fondly called Bal Mane, presented me with a personal computer with all the accessories as a token of friendship and to express his gratitude for the consultancy services provided by me over the years. The pace of this project with better quality has been accelereated and made possible due to the P.C.
At this juncture I also remember my friends and well-wishers Mr. Prashana Sawant, a Systems Scientist in New York and his brother, Mr. Prashant Sawant, Mr. Satish Sawant, D.C.P. Mr. Raosaheb Shinde, Mr. Ashok Kakde, D.C.P. Mr. Shashikant E. Shinde, Mr. Avinahsh Rananaware, Mr. Naresh Dulhani, Ms. Bharati Jadhav, Ms. Geeta Kunder,

Ms. Bindya Kalantri and Mr. Dharmesh K. Shah for their moral support, kindness and assistance from time to time.
Mr. Suraj Subramaniam, at present doing his M.S. in Electronics at the University of Texas, Arlington, U.S.A.and an expert in Web Designing, was very kind to download tons of material on Fixed Stars at a time when I did not have a P.C. He give a print out of all the fixed stars in detail and numerous celebrated charts, covering about 800 pages. Along with him Mr. Jayshankar Natarajan used to assist him in downloading and printing the material which tooks many weeks.
Ms. Mayah Manghnani, Chairperson of Muktangan International Foundation, whose NGO is specially for the defence personnel (who have been injured and disabled while defending our motherland) and their families. She is a social worker who always volunteers to assist the underprivileged, the forlon forsaken. Her good work and noble deeds will be cherished for ever.
Mr. Shivanand Karkera, systems analyst and engineer at Wipro, has been knind enough to teach the use of Corell Draw and other functions of the computer. He has been very kind enough to prepare the charts for thesis, over and over again. He has spent late hours to even keep my P.C. in good condition. I admire his attitude while helping others. An ardent follower of dharma and karma, he does his work as stated in the scriptures: “Do your duty and leave the fruits of reward with Me”. He has been a morale booster all throughout the project.
Mr. Sundeep Arora, Proprietor of Scan Printers and a well-known Rotarian and Social Worker installed the software of Photoshop in my P.C. and taught me how to use it. It has helped in preparing illustrations for the project and course material for students in astrology and palmistry. He has gone out of the way of assist me all the time.
Members of the student community
During the last one decade of my teaching career at Jyotisha Bharati, many of the students have been giving me ideas, suggestions along with encouraging words, I have to confess that the impact of their influence has been a morale booster and source of encouragement in all my work. While praying for success in all their endeavours, I thank them for their kind words of encouragement.
Sharing and Co-operation – a Key factor to Success
It is an undeniable fact that the case studies of “persons known to me” is a success due to their full co-operation. The beneficiaries are our students and lovers of astrology. All the complex astrological theories have been portrayed to life and connected to events. Applied Astrology is an art combining the physically, the metaphysically and the Divine. Art is also an appocolypse of nature. Man is part of nature. I am grateful to these persons for their whole hearted assistance given to me from time to time to monitor events. May the Divine Light shower you with blessings and enable you to harness you energies and vibrations so that they are rekindled into a flame that merges with Divinity itself. Friends, the gift of God is eternal life that awaits us after this temporary sojourn.

INTRODUCTION
“For, by the sacred radiance of the sun, The mysteries of Hecate and the night; By all the operation of the orbs. From whom we do exist and cease to be”
- William Shakespeare
A BRIEF BACKGROUND
Astrology deals with the observation and correlation of energy exchanging between the planets of the solar system, the stars in the constellations and life here on Earth. There are astrological markings uncovered which have been found to date back as far as 3000 B.C. The Chaldeans (later known as the Babylonians) kept records which date back to 700 B.C. Wise men of this period were known as astrologer priests and they were highly esteemed in the community. Their knowledge was based on observations of the positions of stars and planets which they used to cast horoscopes and natal charts for kings and rulers. The priests of the Egyptian Pharaohs were instructed in astrology by the Babylonians for it was a part of their religion.
It is imperative for us to have a glimpse of the dawn of time and the original role that stars played in human lives just to understand the importance of fixed stars and constellations in astrology. Long before there were horoscopes, aspects, houses or signs, dedicated priest astrologers of virtually every civilization, observed and measured sky patterns. The first picture bookof man was the sky and man used to spend hours of the night observing the ever moving heavenly spectacle. Mysterious risings, settings, and circling of the heavens were weighed against mundane phenomena of earth, sea and mankind. The ancient wisdom recorded by earliest scribes, known only to these most learned priests of the earliest civilizations has come into our hands.
In the process of their observation, certain bodies in the sky were seen to be relatively stationary to the earth. To distinguish them from the Planets or the “Wanderers” that move with the zodiac, the ancients called them Fixed Stars. Fixed Stars are suns beyond our solar system. Our sun is a fixed star. Many fixed stars are viewed with astrological interpretation in relationship to worldly events and personal birth charts. They are referred to as fixed because they are generally so far away it takes millions of years for their light to reach our visual sight on earth and thus provide the appearance that they are fixed in the heavens and do not move.
Encyclopedia Britannica states that fixed star was a general name applied to all selfluminous stars by ancient astronomers because, due to their considerable distance from Earth, stars appeared to have no relative motion and so were thought of as remaining fixed in position in sky; Halley proved this wrong in early 18th century; in contrast, planets were called wandering stars.

In reality, these fixed stars also advance at a rate of approximately 50.23” of the arc per year. As the fixed stars are beyond the zodiac, lying in the constellations, they do no move across the ecliptic. Those near the ecliptic and of significant magnitude have considerable influence.
John J. Falone, author of “The Genius Frequency” while writing about the background stars or the fixed stars, says that “we have hardly nicked the surface of this vast potential body of knowledge. Again, for purposes of our understanding, it would be useful to regard the constellations in same way one regards a symphony. The constellations form the chord structures through which we pass and planets are the solo artists that play against this tonal/textural background.”
Learning from the ancients with a reference to the Indian system
Throughout the centuries, people have looked to the stars to help them navigate across open oceans or featureless deserts, know when to plant and harvest, and preserve their myths and folklore. Ancient peoples used the appearance or disappearance of certain stars over the course of each year to mark the changing seasons. To make it easier to "read" this celestial calendar, they grouped the brighter stars into readily recognizable shapes, the constellations.
We are given to understand that our modern constellation system comes to us from the ancient Greeks. The oldest description of the constellations as we know them comes from a poem, called Phaenomena, written about 270 B.C. by the Greek poet Aratus. However, it is clear from the poem that the constellations mentioned originated long before Aratus' time. No one is sure exactly where, when, or by whom they were invented. And yet a little detective work reveals a plausible origin.
The first clue is that Aratus' constellations did not include any near the south celestial pole (the point on the celestial sphere directly above the Earth's south pole) because that area of the sky was always below the horizon of the ancient constellation-makers. From the size of this uncharted area of the sky, we can determine that the people responsible for the original constellations lived near a latitude of 36° north -- south of Greece, north of Egypt, but similar to the latitude of the ancient Babylonians and Sumerians.
In addition, the constellation-free zone is not centered exactly on the south celestial pole. Because of a "wobble" of the Earth's axis of rotation, the position of the celestial poles changes slowly with time, a phenomenon known as precession. The uncharted area is centered on the place in the sky where the south celestial pole would have been around the year 2000 B.C. This date matches the time of the Babylonians and Sumerians.
Since the beginning of time, ancients gazed at the stars with reverence and awe. In contrast, the study of our solar system’s planets, as used in modern astrology, is relatively new - it is only 4500 years old. The stars are termed Fixed Stars because they do not appear to move, as compared to the planets that appear to continually wander the sky.

Ancient Egyptians worshiped the star Sirius (Isis) as its July rising brought fertility to the land through the flooding of the Nile River. And where would modern religion or the retail business be without three wise astrologers called the Magi? New technology makes the study of these ancient stars practical.
Indian System derived from ancient observations
In ancient times the Aryans were living at the North Pole and during the night they observed the sky throughout the year. For 6 months of the year there was day (Brahama’s day) and for another six months there was night (Prajapati’s night). One day of theirs (of 24 hours) was equal to one year of ours. It took one nakshatra or asterism 1000 years to come to the horizon. The scene was a continuous whirling of the dome. Therefore, for the 27 nakshatras used in Indian (Hindu) astrology today, it took 27000 years.

a) The Celestial Equator passed through each nakshatra in turn, which rises exactly in the east (the true east). b) The Sun’s conjunction with the easternly rising nakshatra determined the true east in each age or yuga. c) The east was, therefore, a variable direction.
Later on, due to freezing climatic conditions, the Aryans moved from the North Pole to habitats which were more stable climatically. Some of them settled in Central Asia, others moved to Europe via Greece, the seed of European civilization, while others moved to India through Afghanistan.
The following were their observations :
1. The East was a variable point. The only fixed direction was the zenith and any star occupying this point would be called Dhurva Taraka.
2. Any luminary in the southern hemisphere would be called invisible and the horizon was the celestial equator.
3. The Sun would come to the equator on 21st March and then it is seen whirling round and round, gradually making circles of high altitudes.
4. From 11th June to 1st July, it would be seen stationary for 21 days, whilst at a constant height of 23 1⁄2 degrees.
5. Then the Sun gradually descends and becomes invisible (or sets) on 23rd September.
6. There was a continuous lighted period of 6 months duration (Aha) and an equally long dark period (Rathra).
7. When the Sun comes to the Celestial Equator, it becomes visible to the Polar residents. This phenomenon occurs only once after a year, but it’s rising point shifts in a reverse direction.

8. Modern astronomy tells us that the rate of this shift is known as the Precision of the Equinox, shifting by about 50.23seconds per year.
9. The Sun would come to the same point of the ecliptic, as the equinotical Sun, in about 26,000 years approximately.
10. The Moon would remain invisible so long as her declination was Southern. As soon as her declination became zero, she would make her first appearance to the residents of the North Pole. She would whirl round and round to a height of 30 degrees and after giving a continuous light for about 15 days, would disappear.

11. The Celestial equator slides on the ecliptic in a retrograde direction and hence passes through each star (whose latitude is less than 23 1⁄2 degrees). Hence each star (nakshatra) got its turn of being an eastern star. The equator passes through the same star twice during the period of 26000 years (on the first occasion it intersects the ecliptic at an angle of 22 1⁄2 degrees and the other, it will be intersecting at an angle of 180 degrees from 23 1⁄2 degrees. Hence if Kritikas were an eastern star in 3000 B.C., it were so even in the year 16000 B.C.
12. To the Vedic sages the stars were known as nakshatras ( groups of stars having different shapes). Initially, due to the gradual retrograde shifting of the Sun’s rising position in the horizon of the polar region, it was observed that the Sun shifts the place by an interval of 1000 years and at the end of this period a new star rises in the East. The number of asterism or stars according to the then belief was 24 in one Brahama’s ahoratra of 24000 years.

13. Later on, Abhijit or Wega (6Cap40 to 10 Cap53.so) was included and there was a split up into two parts each of the 3 groups of Phalguni, Ashada and Bhadrapada in the names of Purva and Uttras. Then, in the 28 constellation system one Brahama’s ahoratra was equal to 28000 years
14. When the Aryans left the polar they saw 360 sunrises and sunsets and the nakshatras were modified to 27 (discarding Abhijit) and Brahama’s ahoratra now took a period of 27000 years, corresponding to the 27 nakshatras.
15. In “Astronomical Light on Vedic Culture” R.V Vaidya states the following: “The nakshatra was the period of time taken by a star group to remain as our eastern star for the preceding star. According to him the following stars must have come to the Celestial equator in the century years noted against them:
No. Asterism (star) In the year (B.C.) 1 Aswini 1900 2 Bharni 3300 3 Kritika 3000 4 Rohini 2103 5 Mriga 2700 6 Ardra 4000 7 Punarvasu 7100 8 Pushya 7300 9 Ashlesha 6800 10 Magha 8800 11 Purva Phalguni 12200 12 Utra Phalguni 12800 13 Hasta 9800 14 Chitra 12300 15 Swati 16 Vishaka 13200 17 Anuradha 15100 18 Jayestha 15300 19 Mool 14601 20 Purva Ashada 21 Uttra Ashada 22 Shravana 13000 and 2000 23 Dhanista 14000 and 3000
16. According to the Vedic sages it was the Kritikas that occupy the first place in the list of stars.
17. The Vedic sages observed that the nakshatras were a cluster of stars resembling the parts of the human body or those of the beast, like Mriga the deer or antelope, Hasta, the fingerprints of the hand, etc. The original names given by these sages have changed today.

18. They also observed the constellations which also had different shapes of animals, objects, vehicles, reptiles, etc.
19. Each nakshatra had a particular deity and symbols and remedial measures were taken recourse to for various measures.
20. From time immemorial myths and mysteries have been created around the nakshatras.
Apollonius Tyanaeus, a Greek thinker and traveler of the 1st Century A.D. wrote that in India the first references to astronomy are to be found in the Rig Veda which is dated around 2000 B.C. Vedic Aryans in fact deified the Sun, Stars, Planets and Comets. Astronomy was then interwoven with astrology and since ancient times Indians have involved the planets (called Grahas) with the determination of human fortunes.
From the above it has been noted that the ancient Aryans, from whom we have inherited this vast legacy of the stars, have contributed and enriched the knowledge of the fixed stars, which were observed in their collective form as nakshatras or asterisms. Fixed stars are the brightest stars observed from the nakshatras and constellations.
Richard Hinckley Allen’s book 'Star names - Their lore and meaning' was originally published in 1899. It provides proper names of stars from many cultures over the period of recorded history. The book studies the names of stars, constellation by constellation in an alphabetical order. In each constellation, the proper names of stars from various cultures are discussed. It includes the then contemporary astronomical identity of stars as Flamsteed numbers and Bayer identities. The book covers all the constellations. The period of the book was before formalization of the constellation definitions to 88 by International Astronomical Union in 1930. The pattern followed in the book is to identify all visible stars in each constellation through their Bayer identities and then address their historical European names (Greek and other nationalistic cultures), followed by the Arabic names, the Chinese names and ‘Hindu names`. This has been systematically carried out to cover all the constellations. In each case, anecdotal data is provided using local folklore, historical documents and other cultural documents. An analysis is provided with suggestions as to possible influence of one culture on the other, in arriving at the proper names for stars.
S. Balakrishna's 'Names of Stars from period of Vedas' of 1999, writes :
A number of stars in the sky were given proper names by people of India, i.e, Bharata, during the Vedic period (2000-4000 BC). Amongst them the twenty-eight names were given to stars over 360 degrees of the moon path along the ecliptic. Among these, use of one of these names, Abhijit as a daily star has been discontinued in modern times. Ancient astrology of this culture, called Jyotishya Shasthra, has its origins during that period and has been gradually modified. This astrological system uses a moon-pointer daily star definition, based on the 27 daily stars, with Sanskrit proper names, corresponding to 13.20 degree steps along the ecliptic in the moon path. Efforts have been made to associate and identify these Sanskrit proper names to explicit star or groups of stars along the ecliptic, and determine their modern astronomical names.

In the vedic literature, Bharateeya's have the oldest continuing culture running for thousands of years. Pre-vedic culture understood the motions of the bodies in skies and evolved a moon pointer calendar, moon pointing to daily stars in the skies. Various stars in the moon path and a few others were given proper names many thousand years ago. Some notable proper names from veda's assigned to stars are the 27 or 28 daily stars Ashwini to Revati, the saptarishis(Ursamajor for Rishis Marichi, Vasishta,Angirasa, Atri, Puslastya, Pulaha, Karatu or Gautama, Bhardwaja, Vishvamitra, Kashyapa, Jamdagni, Vasishtha and Atri), Dhruva (Polaris) and Arundhati. Chandramana or Moon pointer almanac has been extensively used during and since Vedic period. The thousands of year old lunar almanac system is an integral part of traditional Bharateeya’s, who probably have a birth horoscope where in an important parameter is the birth Nakshatra and birth Rashi.

THE USE OF FIXED STARS NEGLECTED
Though fixed stars represented an important ancient source of knowledge for astrology, the marked fatalism associated with their interpretation fell into disfavour due to two modern trends:
During the 1600-1800s astrology became less popular after astronomy was disassociated from astrology and became a science in and of it self. The Church and high courts began to proclaim astrology to be a superstition.
Up until the Renaissance, the fixed stars used to be a standard part of the astrological art. But from the Renaissance onwards the marked fatalism associated with their interpretations fell into disfavor with two modern trends; the new knowledge emerging in the Renaissance that developed into the full blown rationalism of the Enlightenment, and which gave a greater complexity to causation and the Protestant Reformation with its stress on free will. The latter lies at the root of a modern individualism aiming at an autonomy which had no use for fate. Gradually, as the cult of freedom developed, the fixed stars, along with the also widely used Arabic Parts, began to drop out of astrological usage. There was of course some reason for the modern prejudice and change. As Noel Tyl observes: "The meanings developed around almost all the stars are drastic, promising scandal, death, blindness, upheaval, chaos etc. Perhaps this was ancient astrology's way of grasping the concept of explaining the painful anomalies of life in those times before there was any knowledge of the trans-Saturnian planets".
Olivia Barclayn states that “Ptolemy's astrology, in fact all astrology, was banned from Europe in the fifth century. It was rescued and preserved by the Arabs. Ptolemy's work was translated into Arabic. European and Arabic astrology merged. Those centuries produced famous Arab and Jewish astrologers, Al Kindi and Abu Masha were Arabic, and Abraham Ibn Ezra was Jewish.
It was not until the thirteenth century that astrology crept back into Europe via Spain and Italy. Ptolemy was translated back into Latin from Arabic. His work was taught in all universities for three centuries. He had been a great man. He had written on music, geography, optics, astronomy, he had calculated the distance of the Moon from the Earth. He had enormous impact on astrological thought. “
Wiliam Lily says: “The reason why there isn't much written about fixed stars in astrology is because astrologers never go out and actually look at the night sky. Metaphysically, each and every star is a unique personality. Should one want to know what kind of personality a star may have, he/she needs only spend time out of doors meditating while gazing steadily upon it, though some ancient writers caution that meditation upon some particular stars can cause insanity, so you're warned. The night sky is awesomely beautiful. Few of us get to see it in all its glory.”

Standing stones used to watch the heavens by the ancients
Standing stones
More single standing stones feature in this guide than any other kind of ancient site. They are usually dated by archaeologists to the Early Bronze Age (about 2000BC), partly because they are sometimes set up in association with kerb cairns which have been dated to this period. Some standing stones may be earlier, however, and so date to the Neolithic period. This may particuarly be true of the cup-marked stones. Excavation of the sockets of such stones is rarely done and seldom provides any dating evidence.
Standing stones can vary from 1.5 metres to 4 metres tall, and often have two long flat faces, or sides. It is the flat faces which usually indicate the directions to look towards the horizon. There are many standing stones in Scotland, for example the giant one at Beacharr on the west coast of Kintyre, which have no apparent axis, no flat sides or faces which could lead an observer to look towards a point on the horizon. Such stones may have lost their partners in a pairing of stones, or in an alignment; but they may also have had other purposes and do not generally feature here. Some surveyors have speculated that stones like this may simply mark the place to stand to watch the sun or moon rise or set over a known, unindicated, horizon point..
Jantar Mantar, New Delhi - Few minutes walk from Connaught Place is is a strange collection of solomon coloured structures. These were built by Maharaja Jai Singh and is actually an observatory. Though not as large as its compatriot in Jaipur, Jantar Mantar at Delhi is also an attraction for the tourists. The astonishing part of these observatories is that they can calculate many astronomical movements very accurately.

A new beginning: The advent of the telescope assisted in developing many new stars, galaxies, black holes, asteroids and planets, thereby bringing into our consciousness new energy. Paraceleus says: “Many stars have not yet cast their influence, that is why there are many arts and sciences yet to be discovered.” William Lily who predicted the great fire of London when the Bull’s North Horn (El Nath) was exactly on 17Gem54’ in 1666, the ascendant of London says: “the fixed stars give great gifts, and elevate from poverty to extreme height of fortune, the seven planets do not do so.”
The influence of the fixed stars differ from that of the planets in being much dramatic, sudden and violent. As a rule planetary effects are gradual and operate comparatively slowly. The extent and magnitude of the effects brought about by the Fixed Stars depend upon several factors, namely:
a) apparent size b) magnitude and their variation in brightness c) celestial position d) nature of planets through which they operate e) general nature of the horoscope f) position of the fixed star in the horoscope.
The Effect Of The Awareness Of The Precision Of The Equinox On Fixed Stars
When we say that "the Earth shifts on its axis and that makes the constellations go into the Zodiac at the wrong dates", what is being described is the precession of the equinoxes. Just to clarify, though, the constellations don't move remember, they are made up of fixed stars. The Sun is what appears to enter the different Signs of the Zodiac. As to the part about the dates and the Zodiac, we'll get to that shortly.

The Earth doesn't so much "shift" on its axis as it "wobbles" The Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of approximately 23°.5’ to the plane of the ecliptic. This tilt is what produces the seasonal variations. The Earth is also not a perfect sphere; it bulges in the middle near the Equator. This unequal distribution of mass causes the Earth to "wobble" around its rotational axis like a gyroscope. What this means is that the Earth's axis makes its own rotation, with the North and South Poles slowly describing a circle around the ecliptic pole (which is the pole exactly perpindicular to the plane of the ecliptic; the North and South poles, remember are tilted 23.5 degrees away from this plane). How slowly? Well, a complete cycle takes about 25,800 years. The precession can also be seen in terms of the "North Star". Currently the North Pole of the Earth is aligned with the fixed star Polaris. This was not the case 3,000 years ago; and by the year 14,000 A.D., the North Star will be Vega, not Polaris.
This rotation of the Earth's axis occurs at something like 1° every 71.5 years (about 5 seconds of arc per year). The "wobble" and the precession of the equinoxes were known to the Ancient Egyptians, although the first official "discovery" of it was made by an Ancient Greek astronomer, Hipparchus, who was born sometime around 190 B.C. It was noted because the Sun was in a slightly earlier position at the time of the Spring Equinox each year (as measured against the fixed stars). Because the movement slips backwards through the zodiac, it is called precession (as opposed to a forward-movement which would be called progression).
Now 1° every 71.5 years doesn't sound like too much, but it certainly adds up over 2,000 years or so, and this is where we get into the different Zodiac systems.
The Effect Of The Awareness Of The Precision Of The Equinox On Fixed Stars.
The awareness of the precession brought in many questions. There was a new dawn of awareness, logic, numbers, maths, and eventually scientific temperament in the minds of astronomers, astrologers and people doing work in related fields. The nature and rate of movement of precession was yet to be determined and solved. By the time of Ptolemy (100180 B.C.E., approximately) the question was still largely unanswered and so attracted a great deal of his attention.
Ptolemy, primarily an astronomer, his real interest was in the mathematics of the sky than its symbolic meaning. His main logistical problem was that two sets of data were required to answer the question on precession: the accurate position of stars for one period in time; and the position of the same list of stars, measured for a later period. By comparing the two lists and knowing the time period between the two, the rate of precession could be found.
The method of locating a star in the sky, in use by the early astronomers before Ptolemy, was to note the date and time of lunar cycles, along with the Moon’s degree of longitude and latitude, then to mark its orientation to a star. As it is the practice for the people lacking scientific knowledge the moon’s position was used to locate the stars at that time in the absence of modern scientific instruments.



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY

Ptolemy proceeded to repeat the situation, found the position of a particular lunation for his current date, and then calculated the star’s movement. To avoid this tedious method not guaranteeing accuracy, Ptolemy decided to develop a better system of recording the position of stars. His logic was that if he could clearly lay down a technique for measuring stars and use that technique for measuring “as many stars as we could up to those of the sixth magnitude,” then he could produce a list of stars that could be used by future generations of astronomers to check his estimates of the rate of precession.
The Measurement of the Fixed Stars by Ptolemy
The first fixed star catalogue was compiled by Timocharis and Aristyll about 250 B.C. in Greece Hipparch, about 150 B.C. improved it. Then it was handed on to future generations in canonical form by Claudius Ptolemy in his astronomical hand-book “Almagest”, a book dominated astronomy for nearly one-thousand four-hundred years. The Almagest was originally called the ‘Mathematical Systematic Treatise’ or ‘Mathematical Syntaxis, it is often just called the Syntaxis. It is Ptolemy’s major work on astronomy. In it he drew on several hundred years of Greek science. He drew on Aristotle for his overall philosophical standpoint. His geometrical methods came from Euclid. His spherical geometry was from Menelaus of Alexandria. He drew on the Astronomer Eudoxus, for his planetary models and on Hipparchus for his catalogue of stars and astronomical methods. The Almagest contains also a catalogue of 1022 stars in 48 constellations. It has descriptions of various sighting instruments and a table of chords to help with calculations.
He wrote about the effects of the fixed stars in the “Tetrabiblos”. In the wording of M.E. Winkel, who added the Arabic version to the names of the stars, paragraph (1,8) of the Tetrabiblos is give below: “Now at that point, we want to contiue to describle the powers of the fixed stars, derived from their nature. I shall line them up so that I fit them to planets according to their similarity.”
Ptolemy developed a simple instrument which would enable him to make the measurements needed. He found the poles of the ecliptic and then he projected every star onto the ecliptic via the lines of longitude from these poles. The point where the projected star cut the ecliptic was carefully measured, as well as the star’s latitude north or south of the ecliptic. He measured 1022 stars and published this list in his Almagest.
It was an ingenious system. It meant that the position of a star could be accurately and simply recorded. It could be reproduced in years to come so that any change in the ecliptical position of the star could be easily noted. It was a huge advancement for astronomers and placed Ptolemy among the giants of astronomy. However, it seems to have altered the way in which astrology worked with fixed stars. Until that time the evidence suggests that the predominant method for working with stars in astrology was via their risings, culminations, and settings. However, within several hundred years, astrologers had taken Ptolemy’s convenient list of stars with their ecliptical degrees and were applying it to their trade, forsaking the more tedious, older methodologies. Ptolemy had developed the list as an astronomer, for astronomical needs. He was, after all, an astronomer, and the book where he published this listing was not his book on astrology, “Tetrabiblos” but his great astronomical

work, “The Almagest”. Later astrologers, however, swayed by the eminence of his name, chose to use Ptolemy’s star list of ecliptical projected degrees as the preferred methodology for working with fixed stars astrologically.
This was a slow transition, for in 379 B.C., “The Treatise on Bright Fixed Stars,” written by an unknown author, talks of using stars which are close to the ecliptic in the above fashion but uses stars that are away from the ecliptic to work with the “pivot points” of the chart. This is known today as working in parans.
The Projected Ecliptical Degrees (called PED) of Ptolemy were based on the poles of the ecliptic. His list of 1022 stars and their PED were then precessed through the ages, with each generation of astrologers adding the current rate of precession to find the current ecliptical position of any star in their time. Ptolemy’s star catalog was used in this manner for well over a thousand years until the time of Ulugh Beg (1394-1449), a Mongolian-Turkish ruler and astronomer who developed the Fahkri sextant, and that of Regiomontanus (1436-1476). These two astronomers re-plotted all of Ptolemy’s star catalog, which laid the foundation for Albrecht Durer (1471-1528) to produce star maps based on the poles of the equator (rather than in the manner of Ptolemy who based his measurements on the poles of the ecliptic as shown in the figure below.
EQUATOR ECLIPTIC
THE POLES OF THE ECLIPTIC AND THE POLES OF THE EQUATOR
North Pole measured from the ecliptic - the Pole used by Ptolemy.
North Pole measured from the equator - the pole used today for the projection of stars on the ecliptic
Using this new method of projection, each of the 1022 stars of Ptolemy’s list was given a new ecliptical position. The astrologers at the time of Ulugh Beg and Regiomontanus seemed to accept this change in the position of the fixed stars without question. Since that day, astrologers and astronomers alike have used the poles of the equator rather than that ofthe ecliptic for all such projections. So, first the astrological world accepted Ptolemy’s astronomical work, which in turn led to the decline in the use of the older system of parans. And if that was a valid step to take, then we have to question why the astrological community accepted the work done by Ulugh Beg, for it changed the ecliptical position of every fixed star recorded by Ptolemy.

If an astrologer works with a star’s projected ecliptical degree, when a star is in the same degree as the Ascendant for a particular chart, it bears no visual connection to the actual location of the star. The star may have risen hours earlier or may not be due to rise for some hours to come.
In figure below the shaded area is the plane of the horizon. The figure shows the star Hamal, the alpha star of Aries, rising on the horizon. If you look at the ecliptical degree on the Ascendant at the time that Hamal is rising, it is 24 Pisces. So, for that particular location, Hamal will always rise with 24 Pisces. However, if you can imagine a line drawn from one celestial pole to the other, (the dashed line in the figure), and have that line pass through Hamal, it will cut the ecliptic at 5 Taurus. So Hamal’s PED would be 5 Taurus. Now if we say that Hamal’s PED is 5 Taurus and accept that as the position for Hamal, we could, by mistake, actually imply that the star is physically at 5 Taurus, when in truth this is just a mathematical concept. For when 5 Taurus eventually does rise at that location, Hamal, which co-rises with 24 Pisces, would have long since left the horizon and be quite high in the sky.
Thus, although Hamal may be projected back to 5 Taurus, it also has another ecliptical position which is based on the degree in which it co-rises. This new position varies from latitude to latitude and in this example links Hamal with 24 Pisces. This question of what degree a star co-rises at is an example of the older method of parans.

Linking energies of the fixed stars
Ptolemy is also renowned for linking the energy of each fixed star to a combination of planetary energies. He published this work in the Tetrabibiblos, chapter 9, where he makes such statements as: “The stars in the head of Aries possess an influence similar in its effect to that of Mars and Saturn.” It is important to think about what Ptolemy was trying to achieve by linking each star to a combination of planets.



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 40 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
Cyril Faggan’s comments on linking energies of the fixed stars:"The word ruler is,however, not a happy choice. In Ptolemy's time it was believed that the earth was the center of the universe, with the Sun, Moon, planets and stars revolving round it. So it was natural to suppose that each planet ruled the distant constellations. But in our modern Copernican conception of the universe it is utterly preposterous to believe that Mercury, relatively a mere speck of cosmic dust compared to the magnitude of many of the fixed stars, could rule the constellation Virgo which contains within its confines teeming billions of fixed stars and other universes (i.e. spiral nebulae, galaxies). So when we say that Mercury rules Virgo, we merely mean the influences of all the fixed stars in the constellation Virgo, taken in the aggregate, accord with those of the planet Mercury, and similarly for the other zodiacal constellations and their planetary rulers..."
In the Timaeus, Plato talks of the creator, the Demiurge, making the human soul in the same manner as the Soul of the Universe, and that the numher of these souls is the number of the fixed stars. Based on this, the “wandering stars,” or planets, were singled out as the time keepers, and it was thought that the souls moved from fixed stars to the wanderers, their power thereby translated into the souls of men.
Thus Ptolemy, who would have been familiar with the work of Plato, would have felt it was proper and correct to translate the mythological impact and meaning of every fixed star into a planetary combination. The purpose here was not to ignore the fixed stars mythologically but to seek their possible planetary power, hinted at by Plato. However, as time passed, it seems that these planetary meanings took center stage, with astrologers losing or forgetting the once great stories, morals, and life lessons woven around each star. So the combination of all these factors-the use of projected ecliptical degrees for the stars, their later modification by Ulugh Beg and Regiomontanus, and the loss of many of their original meanings by their reduction to planetary expressions-has meant that fixed stars have lost their central place of importance in astrology.
As astrologers abandoned the constellations, no longer observing and taking note of their rising and setting, the images and stories preserved in the starry sky disintegrated. The sky was left open to astronomers who, having no love for the shape of the heavens, proceeded to place their world on the skies and to carve ancient and beautiful constellations into smaller groups to suit their purpose. The Great She-Bear goddess protector of all life, the celestial north pole, became the Big Dipper. Orion, god on the equator, became a saucepan or a tea pot. Argo, the great ship of the south originally used by the Egyptian pharaohs for their journeys to the underworld, became a broken wreck drifting around the South Pole. The starry sky; the veiy model for the formation of the individual human psyche and the collective’s theology, was eventually discarded even by the people who sought to study humans and events via their relationship to the cosmos. Astrology seems to have lost contact with that which is the very central tenet of our art.

PARANS : THE MATHEMATICAL SYSTEM
Due to the daily rotation of the earth, stars and planets will rise, culminate, set, and be on the nadir at different times throughout the course of the 24 hours of the day. If at any stage a star is on one of the four angles (rising, culminating, setting, or on the nadir), while at the same time a planet is also on any of these four places, then the star is linked to the planet via what is called a paran.
This method of parans is the most ancient way of working with fixed stars.
Because parans are based on examining the times when stars and planets are at the key moments of their diurnal movement, the place and date of birth is important, but the actual time of birth is not required
Michael Jonathan McDonald define parans :
If a star or a planet is on any of these four points at the same time as a star or planet is on the same point or any of the other three points, then those two plants are in paran.
Example A 90-degree aspect that forms a astrological aspect to a planet to a star. Usually said to be in positions on the power points, 1,4,7,10 houses. As the day moves along, at one point or another if a planet is in paran to a star, it will encircle all these points in a 24-hour period.
Now as stars and Earth are not on a single plane and Earth rotates as well as revolves around the Sun, the stars position moves in all sorts of directions across the horizons. Example is that as the latitude changes, so does the horizon line of the circle changes its orientation ship to the stars. The important point is that the full circle of the horizon is used, not just the eastern and western points of the ecliptic. As already mentioned, the mathematical system used by the ancients star gazers is what is called parans. It is a single concept. Imagine you have a 360 degree clear view of the horizon and picture it as a starry night. If you look eastward you will see stars rising. They will be rising on a half the circle of the horizon, not just due east. As you watch a star that is rising northeast of you, there may be, at the same time, another star in the southeast also rising. The two stars rising simultaneously are said to have a paran relationship, aspected by the horizon line, which is the straight line that joins the stars together. Similarly, a star may be rising as a star is setting, and this line is the mathematical formulation that we are using and so these two stars are also in paran relationship.
So if you see the Moon or Venus rise or set and at the vary same time a star rises or sets, then the moon is said to be with the star in a paran relationship. Sometimes it is said they co-rise together.

Another point in the sky that is deemed of prime importance is called the culmination point. If you are standing outside facing either south or north, try to imagine an invisible line directly over your head. This would be called the culmination point of the exact time you are picturing it in your mind. You are under the MC, or Midheaven. Stars anywhere along this line are said to be culminating.
The culmination point adds another possibility for a paran placement. And that would be a star or a planet rising or setting just as another planet or star is culminating. Remember that we are dealing with a circle here so there must be an opposite axis. A star can be there as well, and so this placement is named "nadir."
So it is said that if a star or a planet is on any of these four points at the same time as a star or a planet is on the same point or any of the other three points, then these two planets or stars or combinations of both are in paran.
An explanation of Parans by Laura Mahoney : “A short note of introduction to Parans might be appropriate here. Imagine, if you will, that you’re on the beach of a small island. Looking out onto the expanse of the surrounding sea, you have a 360° view along our horizon, and you also know the direction of true North. Now, imagine that you see a boat in the Southwest, and that this boat is on the horizon line. Simultaneously, a second boat appears, but at a point that is at the opposite direction, Northeast along the horizon, and a third ship looms up, at the same moment, on the Southeast line. This relationship of connections along the horizon line is what has been called a Parans, and the entire full circle of the horizon line is utilized.
Cyril Fagan’s defines paranatellonta or parans: “If two or more planets or fixed stars bodily rise or set simultaneously, or come to the Midheaven or Nadir together, or if one crosses any of the angular cusps while another is also crossing an angle, then each is said to be the parantellonta of the other. These paranatellontas constitute the most powerful configurations in prognostic astronomy, and even a beginner should be able to see why this should be so. Paranatellonta is a Greek word signifying "acting simultaneously," but it is such a long and difficult-to-pronounce word, let us hereafter abbreviate it to paran -- say "per-ran" for convenience.”
Bernadette Brady in her book of Fixed Stars says : “In reconstructing the way in which the sky and stars were possibly used in astrology, we cannot simply search out the original stories and meanings and apply modern techniques to their use. The first important step is to understand the original methodologies that were used by our ancient predecessors.
As already mentioned, the mathematical system used by the ancient star gazers is what is called parans. Paran, comes from paranatellonta, meaning literally, "rising side by side." This refers to a transiting object and natal object rising over the horizon and meridian at the same time. Many combinations of Parans are available coming from the factors of oblique ascension, oblique descension, and right ascension. It is a simple concept. Imagine that you have a 360 clear view of the horizon and let it be a starry night. If you look eastward you will see stars rising. They will be rising on half the circle of the horizon, not just due east. As you watch a star that is rising northeast of you, there may be, at the same time,



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY

another star in the southeast also rising. The two stars rising simultaneously are said to have a paran relationship.” (see figure below ).
(illustration reproduced from “Fixed Stars” by B. Brady)
Therefore, there are four points where parans can occur :
1. The rising side of the horizon circle 2. The setting side of the horizon circle 3. The upper part on the prime meridian, or “culminating” 4. The part opposite this below the horizon, or “on the nadir”
If a star or a planet is on any of these four points at the same time as a star or a planet is on the same point or any of the other three points, then those two planets or stars are in paran.
MYTHOLOGY OF THE FIXED STARS
When Aristotle wrote to Alexander, he said: “Heaven is full og the gods to whom we give the name of stars”. In many rural areas, peasants used to tell their children that the stars were the eyes of the angels. As man’s intellect grew, he expanded his relationship with the universe through an intricate legendary of the constellations and the starry patterns. Many ancient civilizations of Greece, India, Rome, Egypt, Chaldea, China, etc. lay claim to the study of the constellations and stars, with proof of history, theory and tradition. Despite all this, we can conclude that the myths we have inherited from the ancients enrich our appreciation for the starry patterns associated with them.

1. The Pole Star : Polaris
But I am constant as the Nothern Star, Of whose true and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament. Julius Ceasar William Shakespeare
Astronomical Information:
Perhaps more than any star other than our Sun, Polaris has been regarded as the most important star in the heavens. Located almost directly overhead as seen from the North Pole, it is the end-star in the tail of Ursa Minor, the Little Bear. Its name comes from the Latin, Stella Polaris, meaning "Pole Star." Polaris has long been an important star to sailors and caravans of old winding their way over the desert by night, and others who navigated their way by stars.
To our eyes, Polaris appears to be motionless at the center of the field of circumpolar stars. All the other stars appear to circle about Polaris. As early as 320 B.C. the Greeks had realized that Polaris did not mark the pole exactly. Until then many people had believed that the heavenly pole was absolutely and eternally fixed. Not so. Polaris has long been moving nearer the North Celestial Pole, as it is still doing now. It will be closest to that position around A.D. 2105--27'. Currently it is about 1° from the celestial pole.
The Pole Star once was Thuban (3000 B.C.), the third star from the end of the tail in Draco. In a little more than 5,000 years from now, Alderamin, the brightest star in the constellation Cepheus, will be the Pole Star. About 7,000 years from now, Deneb, the brightest star in Cygnus, will be the Pole Star for a while. In about 12,000 years from now, Vega, the brightest star in Lyra, will be the Pole Star. Vega will be a brilliant Pole Star some six times brighter than Polaris. There are long periods when there is no Pole Star at all. At the present time there is no Pole Star in the southern sky.
Mythology and History
Polaris has been known by many names in the past--the Lodestar, the Steering Star, the Ship Star, and Stella Maris ("Star of the Sea"). In China it was known as Tou Mu, Chinese goddess of the North Star. Greek navigators of old called Polaris Kynosoura, which means the "Dog's Tail." The name came into our English language as cynosure, which means "something that strongly attract attention by its central position."
In Scandinavian mythology the Norse gods made the Universe out of the bits and pieces of the hacked-up bodies of their defeated enemies. To finish the job they hammered an enormous spike, called Veralder Nagli, or "World Spike," into the center of the Universe and made the sky revolve about it. The end of the spike had a jeweled nail-head, which remained forever fixed on the great sky dome as Polaris.
The Omaha Indian story begins during a time of tribal disruption, brought on by rivalries between Omaha chiefs. One of their sons left the village and went out on a hunt. While the council of chiefs was meeting to see if it could find a way to keep the tribe together and save it from extinction, the son of the chief lost his way in the forest. Disoriented and unable to return to camp, he pushed back the brush in an attempt to spot Mika Em Thi Ashi, the "Star

That Does Not Walk." He hoped to use the Pole Star to guide his way home.the Pole Star to guide his way home.Instead he spotted a burning light in the distance. Thinking it was a campfire he headed for it. But when he got close enough to tell what it was, he discovered the light was produced by a burning tree. It was a supernatural tree, however, for despite the roaring flames around the trunk and throughout the branches, it remained unconsumed. When he touched it to test the heat of the fire, he discovered it was cool. Realizing he had encountered something extraordinary, he kept an eye on the flaming tree until dawn, and at sunrise, it returned to normal. The whole experience was so uncanny, he decided to stay another night and watch the fireworks once more. As the sky turned dark, the tree began to glow with the same magical fire. By the next morning, the chief's son must have figured out how to find his way home, for he returned to his father and described what he had seen. They went back to the tree together to catch its next performance.
His father noticed that the Thunderbirds trailed fire when they arrived at the tree or departed. Each Thunderbird traveled from one of the world's Four Winds, and their flights and falling flame guaranteed four paths would be scorched to coincide with the four cardinal directions. Pilgrimages the forest animals had made to the tree had worn the four paths smooth with their footsteps.
Whenever the four Thunderbirds took their perches on the tree, it burst into the magical flames first seen by the chief's son, but the light from this fire could only be seen at night. The chief declared the tree to be a gift from Wakonda, the Great Spirit within all life and existence. Wakonda is the source of the world's rightness, or order. According to the Omaha, he "causes day to follow night without variation and summer to follow winter." They add, "We can depend on these regular changes and order our lives by them." Concluding that the wonderful ever-burning tree would be just the emblem needed to keep the Omaha people from dispersing, the chief returned to the tribe to tell them about this miraculous tree. At his recommendation, a party of Omaha warriors went back to the tree in full regalia, ceremonially attacked the tree, cut it down, and brought it back to their village. There they reerected it and put responsibility for its keeping into the hands of a single clan, a clan designated to be the caretakers. Leadership of the tribe was invested in the keepers of the pole, and only through them could authority over the tribe be transferred. Through this tree, now transformed into the Sacred Pole, the threatened social order of the Omaha was strengthened. Problems, disagreements, and troubles were all to be brought, with presents and prayers, to the Sacred Pole. [Beyond the Blue Horizon: Myth & Legends of the Sun, Moon, Stars, & Planets by Dr. E.C. Krupp © 1991]
The Arabs of old regarded Polaris as a hole in the sky in which Earth's axis found its bearing. They looked on the star as an evil star, calling it Al Kiblah, because it was the star "least distant from the pole." It was Polaris, they said, who had slain the great warrior of the sky who forever lies in the huge coffin outlined by the stars marking the Big Dipper. All the other stars mourn for their lost hero and each night march slowly around the sky in a neverending funeral procession. The villain, Polaris, alone is kept motionless, an outcast forever fixed to the coldest part of the northern sky.
The Moguls looked on Polaris as holding the Universe together. They called it the Golden Peg.

Astronomers of India called Polaris the Pivot of the Planets.
2. The Four Royal Stars Of Persia: Early Cardinal Points
These 4 stars are special and unique, giving power and promising success if the native is capable of dealing with and overcoming the hurdles placed before him because they represent a special weakness and dilemma at the same time.
a) Aldebaran, (Rohini) in Taurus. Considered by Anonymous of 379 to be the greatest star of them all. Linked with integrity and honesty. Aldebaran, the “Eye of the Bull,” would have been the Watcher of the East, conjunct the Sun at the Spring Equinox – it was at the “Aries Point. If the Vernal Point was conjunct Aldebaran, this would be within “The Age of Taurus.” The 2000 position for Aldebaran is 9 degrees of Gemini and forty-seven minutes. Ptolemy gives Aldebaran the nature of Mars, although there clearly seems to be a large dose of Jupiter present. Vivian Robson, in his classic Fixed Stars and Constellations in Astrology, says this about Aldebaran's influence: “It gives honor, intelligence, eloquence, ferocity, a tendency to sedition, a responsible position, public honors and gain of power and wealth through others, but its benefits seldom prove lasting and there is also danger of violence and sickness.” Bernadette Brady says that looked at basic myths related to Aldebaran and concluded that one could succeed while overcoming challenges to one’s integrity. Among others, she notes that George Bernard Shaw, Galileo, and Machiavelli all represent different qualities of working with issues of success and integrity. One may also note, however, that Aldebaran is conjunct Jackie Kennedy’s seventh house Jupiter and Jack Kennedy’s Sun. Aldebaren is associated with honor, intelligence, extraordinary energy and enthusiasm, but there is a threat of danger from enemies.
b)Antares(Jayesta), in Scorpius. Linked with obsession; intense, and probing. Antares, otherwise called Cor Scorpio or the “Heart of the Scorpion,” would be the Watcher of the West and would be in our Libra. Antares is 9 degrees of Sagittarius forty-six minutes. Antares is twenty-six degrees south declination. . Ptolemy gives Antares the nature of Mars and Jupiter, but, since it is the Heart of the Scorpion. , Antares is very volatile and Marslike, associated with rashness, stubbornness, destructiveness, and violence. The native would be given to extremes, for either good or ill. Bernadette Brady states that people with Antares prominent may well cause their own undoing – they may have to conquer themselves first before they can make a contribution to others. Brady notes Antares prominent in the charts of Nelson Mandela, Agatha Christie, and, a personal favorite, Joan of Arc. Antares suggests high intelligence, honors, power but with a sudden loss. This is a political and military star.
Aldebaran and Antares are both the alpha-stars, or the brightest stars, of their respective constellations Taurus and Scorpio. They are also both five degrees of latitude south of the ecliptic. Aldebaran is seventeen degrees north declination, and Antares is twenty-six degrees south declination. The difference is, of course, because Aldebaran is in Taurus, which is north of the celestial equator, and Antares is in Scorpio, south of the celestial equator.
c) Fomalhaut Mouth of the Fish
Fomalhaut is the mouth of the constellation Southern Fish, and it's name is from the Arabic for "fish's mouth." This is our first star in a nonzodiacal constellation. The Southern Fish

isn't far from the constellation Aquarius, and indeed the fish could be seen drinking the water from the urn of the water-carrier. In deluge legends, this constellation is a symbol of salvation, as the mouth is drinking the waters of the flood. Already we're beginning to see that Fomalhaut is not particularly military or governmental in manifestation, is not nearly as macho as the other three Royal Stars. Fomulhaut can be very treacherous or very benefic. It possesses creative, especially musical talent.
Ptolemy gives Fomalhaut the nature of Mercury and Venus, so here we're dealing more with personal charisma. Modern authors, citing traditional sources, call it fortunate and powerful quality but sometimes leading to a dissipation of energy. Alan Oken feels it has a strongly Neptunian quality. Bernadette Brady likens it to idealism and love of beauty and harmony, but the native has to watch his or her motivations. Fomalhaut certainly adds refinement and personal appeal, but, like other powerful fixed stars, its energy can be entirely too much. (Remember that fixed stars delineations occurred before the discovery of the outer planets, so that the stronger ones have a volitive quality similar to how we interpret the outer planets.)
Fomalhaut is far from the ecliptic, over twenty degrees. It's even farther from the equator, at thirty degrees south latitude. Therefore this planet is more often in the sky at southern latitudes. The position of three degrees Pisces is only that place in the zodiac that is the closest, but the star is never near the Zodiac! (By the way, this is also the situation with Pluto!)
d) Regulus, (Magha the mighty) in Leo. the Heart of the Lion, linked with success without revenge. Its interpretation is clear and unambiguous and like the sign Leo; its position is right next to the ecliptic so it poses no special problems for the beginner.
Its’ current position is in the last minutes of 29 Leo. In his Tetrabiblos Ptolemy cited about thirty stars in his major work and likened them all to the planets of astrology. Interestingly, Ptolemy stated that Regulus agrees with Mars and Jupiter. Later authors thought Regulus similar to Jupiter primarily, with an assist from the red planet Mars. Of all the starry planets, Jupiter is the most regal. It moves across the night sky brightly and deliberately, like nobility. Jupiter is the "great benefic," who bestows good fortune material and a sense of possibility psychologically. Assisting is Mars, which has a further enterprising nature and is affiliated with fighting and warfare.
Regulus, placed as the Heart of the Lion, or Cor Leonis, of the constellation Leo, is affiliated with courage, liberality and generosity, nobility, and high and lofty ideals. That's the good news. Robson states also that it can give temporary success ("military honor," he says) followed by eventual failure, which may culminate in imprisonment or a violent death. Bernadette Brady, using Greek and Egyptian legend, finds a middle course, stating that one can "gain great success by facing a particular nemesis."

If Regulus is rising, culminating, or conjunct the Sun or another planet within a degree, it may be especially powerful in your chart. Look to see if you have planets or angles near 29 Leo.
It would be even more powerful if your work in life entails competition for success and fame. This star may give notoriety and fame but not lasting success or happiness. For example, it's conjunct Moon in George Wallace's chart and conjunct the Midheaven in Jackie Kennedy's. For a person more like one of us, if Regulus is prominent, expect highminded ideals and a competitive spirit, which results in success which may not be lasting.
Regulus is conjunct the ecliptic, so that the degree of Regulus rising or culminating in your birthchart corresponds to that star actually being right there. As we will discover in future segments of this series, that's not often so!
Remember that fixed stars "move" about one degree every seventy-two years. (Actually the Earth is wobbling very slightly over the centuries, which also accounts for Precessional Ages.) In a few years Regulus's position moves into the zodiacal sign Virgo!
This also means that about 4300 years ago, in 2320 BCE, Regulus would have been the star conjunct the Sun at the Summer Solstice. (Multiply 72 degrees a year by 60 degrees from 0 Cancer to Regulus's current position.) This star would be extremely important in timekeeping for the various nascent civilizations of that time. This Fixed Star has an orb of almost 5° to 6° and ranges from 26° Leo to above 3° Virgo.

THE STARS OF THE ORION
The following 3 stars radiate achievement and their presence shower benefits for those who strive to achieve at any level of life.
1) Rigel (located in Orion’s foot). It is the brightest star, linked with giving knowledge to or teachmg others in any field of knowledge. Robson says that it is a star of ambition.
2) Betelgeuse is located in the constellation Orion which Egyptian mythology associate with the abode or soul of the God, Osiris, a Sun-God, as an emanation of the Father-Sun, and representing the living breath of the Father. Betelgeuse is associated with attributes of the Father-Sun and rejuvenation/ transformation /ascension and with success which is not blocked. Again, Betelgeuse is impressing its form onto Jupiter and communicating to Earth a message of this kingly/blissful essence Betelgeuse (in the right armpit or shoulder) indicates victory, success, achievement. Betelgeuse makes one brilliant and gives martial honor, power and wealth. It brings success and fame.
3)Belatrix (in the left shoulder), indicates success by facing one’s shadow. It is known as the Amazon star or the Female warrior or the Roaring Conqueror. The pathway to success will have a price with a lot of impediments to overcome.
Other key stars:
If your chart has any of these stars active via the concept of parans, then your life will be entwined with some of the most ancient and profound myths of the human race.
Sirius - Star of Success
1. Sirius, in Canis Major. The brightest star and known as the Dog Star. Gives brilliance. Sirius is the star whose rising signaled the flooding of the Nile and the beginning point of the ancient Egyptian yearly calendar. It was also affiliated with the goddess Isis and had the good fortune of not moving by precession (due to a fluke of the ancient calendar, it is said), for a very long time, unlike the other stars. It is also most often the brightest star in the sky during much of the year, and it is found in the night sky starting around August of each year.
Sirius is in the constellation Canis Major and is also known as the "dog star" and its rising signaled the hottest time of the summer, hence "dog days." However, its brightness and divine affiliation merits Sirius as a very potent and brilliant star when placed in a person's birthchart. Ptolemy gave it the nature of Mars and Jupiter -- so we're back to military and governmental enterprise. It's a star of success although it can also be on the extravagant side. Sirius appears to heighten the beneficial qualities of that planet it is affiliated with. Bernadette Brady extends this interpretation further: "This very strong star indicates that you may, by your effort, gain far more than what is expected -- the mundane becoming sacred. Hence a small action becomes a symbol for the collective, a sense of ritual in daily life." Importantly, she says the success Sirius brings can "burn you."

2. Spica in Virgo (Chitra), indicates a great gift. Spica is is traditionally considered the most benefic fixed star. Spica is the brightest star in the constellation Virgo and thus is also known as alpha Virginis. It is located in the sheaf of wheat held by Virgo. Spica is one of the most auspicious stars denoting success, fame, honors, and wealth and a love of the arts and sciences. Bernadette Brady says that Spica was considered a symbol of the gifts of harvest and bounty to mankind. Ptolemy says that Spica is of the nature of Venus and to a lesser extent Mars. The Renaissance mage Cornelius Agrippa says, "Under the Spike [Spica] they made the image of a bird, or a man laden with merchandise; it conferreth riches, and maketh one overcome contentions, it taketh away scarcity and mischief." Spica is a brilliant white binary star marking the Ear of corn in the maiden's left hand. Deviant titles include Spicum, Spigha, Stachys, stakhus (Greek: 'ear of corn'), Arista (Latin, 'ear of grain'), Aristae Puella (Latin: 'grain maiden') and Spica Virginis or 'Virgin's Spike'. In ancient Egypt the star was associated with the Nile goddess Isis and temples in the ruined city of Akhenaton appear to have been aligned to its rising and setting. As was generally the case in ancient astrology the principle star characterised the entire constellation, which was known to the Egyptians as the 'most dedicated wife'.
An Egyptian Coptic title was Khoritos, 'Solitary', on account of Spica being such a notably brilliant star in an otherwise poorly lit area of the sky. This visible isolation has contributed to a reputation of being unfruitful or unfortunate for marriage, but otherwise Spica is considered a very fortunate star, particularly for those concerned with arts, sciences, law or religion. Ptolemy noted its influence as like that of Venus and, in a less degree, that of Mars but it is often described in a manner that suits a Mercury-Venus temperament and it is said to promote fortune in all matters related to 'Veneriall or Mercuriall men'.
William Lilly noted that Spica prenotes the Native to attaine the chiefest Degree of Ecclesiasticall preferment, or a rich Benefice, with applause and great Estimation, and substance attending it, and all these for the admirable parts of his ingenuity; all matters or affairs he has to do with Veneriall or Mercuriall men, succeed well. Of the general nature of the star he wrote that it expressed a person of sweet disposition, diligent in attaining Arts and Sciences, or a most admirable invention when Mercury is with him; if Saturn be there it imports a suspicious person, sharp and rugged, violent in dispute; if Mars be with Spica, it presupposes a rigid person, and yet a fool, or little better."
Of the direction of the midheaven to Spica Lilly wrote: “Unexpected Honour or Preferment is conferred on the Native beyond his hopes or capacity, and many times it affords power of life or death over others : most Astrologers do hold the mid-heaven directed to the Virgins Spike, to signify Church preferment; but it must act according to the Birth or capacity of the Native...”

While on the direction of the Moon to the star he notes:
“It contributes unto the Native, store of Wealth, and Plenty of Honour, for his excellent parts and endowments of the Mind, and therefore he receives from Mercurial, Veneriall and Jovial Persons.”
3. Canopus, in Carina, part of the rudder of the great ship Argo augurs pathfinding. Carinae (formerly Argus). The second brightest star in the sky, but situated at 52 degrees south declination. A line drawn from Bellatrix through the northern star in Orion's Belt passes to Canopus. It is almost due south from Sirius and a pale blue color. According to Ptolemy it is of the nature of Saturn and Jupiter; and, to Alvidas, of the Moon and Mars. It gives piety, conservatism, a wide and comprehensive knowledge, voyages and educational work, and changes evil to good. (Robson).
Ebertin tells us that Canopus has been noted several times in the nativities of writers and film actors and especially of those persons who, in our times, have had to undertake many journeys in connection with their position.RH. Allen says that Arabic astrologers believed that Canopus imparted the much prized color to their precious stones, and conferred immunity from disease. And in a general way it served them as a southern pole-star. The Arabs knew it as Suhel, the Plain. This word also was a personal title in Arabia, the symbol of what is brilliant, glorious, and beautiful, and even now among the nomads is thus applied to a handsome person.
Some Stars Puzzling Astrologers: These stars present lessons to charts that are definitely more difficult than others and many authorities have ascribed to them the power of cruelty and destruction. The older version handed down to us are present in all the charts and even these cruel stars have given us good results. This proves that: • The charts should be seen in its tolality & • Character is destiny.
3. Facies, in Sagittarius represents Pure combative energy. The cluster in the forehead of the Archer, which Ptolemy likens to the influence of the Sun and Mars includes Facies. This, like the point of the Arrow, is associated with blindness, defective sight; and, as is generally the case with nebulous clusters, sickness, accidents or a violent death. It is of the nature of the Sun and Mars, and causes blindness, defective sight, sickness, accidents and a violent death. (Robson). There is a positive side to Facies, it symbolizes well that kind of Sagittarian who goes out to climb mountains, race cars, enter the ski-jump team or the Grand National steeplechase, making it right to the top and no doubt breaking a few bones along the way. On the more philosophical side it will mark those who must see their outlook and beliefs carried into practical effect somewhere, so that they go out on missions, set up their own churches and centers engage in good works of famine or refugee relief and so on. Inevitably they get hurt at times, but perhaps find compensation in the value of their works. (Dr. Eric Morse).

5. Capulus, in Perseus’s sword shows primitive, male, sexual energy; penetrating and ruthless. 53°5' / 40° 22' N (cl) Capulus, 33 Uranus vi Persei. Noonan says that it is a double cluster in the sword-hand of Perseus. (Mars, Mercury) Defective eyesight. A star cluster in the sword hand of Perseus the Hero. With the Sun linked to Capulus, one is strongly focused with forceful action. When prominent in a natal chart it is said to denote adventurous individuals, but also those who are less than honest in their dealings with others.
6. Algol in Perseus’s hand is primitive, female, sexual energy; passionate, intense, and also hysterical in the true sense of the word. Algol is an eclipsing binary - every 68 hours and 49 minutes the demon "blinks" for roughly 8 hours as the dimmer star of the pair passes between the brighter and the earth Algol is the second brightest star of the constellation Perseus and thus is sometimes referred to as Beta Persei. The name Algol, says Richard Hinckley Allen, comes from the Arabic Ras Al-Ghul, which literally means the Mischief Maker. Star Names (Dover, 1963) page 332. Algol is called the Demon, the Demon Star and is also known as the Blinking Demon because it is part of a binary star system where a dimmer star periodically eclipses its brighter partner. Algol has a very bad reputation among astrologers. Vivian Robson says, "It is the most evil star in the heavens." The Fixed Stars and Constellations in Astrology. William Lilly gives a significator a score of minus five points if within five degrees of Algol and says it prenotes death either by violence to oneself or others. Christian Astrology.
One would think that this is a star to stay well away from. However, Cornelius Agrippa says: ‘’Under the Head of Algol, they made an image whose figure was the head of a man with a bloody neck; they report that it bestoweth good success to petitions, and make him go carrieth it bold and magnanimous, and preserveth the members of the body sound; also it helpeth against witchcraft, and reflecteth evil endeavours, and wicked incantations upon our adversaries’’.
7. Canopus: According to Ptolemy, this star has the nature of Jupiter and Saturn and is equally tied to great achievements. But more specifically, the star is mythologically associated with Canopus, the pilot of the Argo and therefore has travel and journeying as one of its primary associations. While its nature is primarily given a positive spin by Brady, the Medieval literature also associates it with danger, which may stem from the fact that Canopus died while returning his ship back from the Trojan War. The Egyptians made him the navigator of the ship which carried the souls to the underworld.
8. Menkar, in Cetus indicates the unconscious becoming conscious. The sudden emergence of deep unconscious issues. According to Ptolemy it is of the nature of Saturn; to Simmonite, of Mars; and, to Alvidas, of Venus and the Moon. It causes disease, disgrace, ruin, injury from beasts, sickness, and loss of fortune. Menkar is a star associated with disgrace and loss of fortune.

Ebertin says that this star has a Saturnine character, corresponding to impediments of many kinds, worries and tests of endurance. Unjustified enmities, hardening and toughening these people in some ways. In some cases with conjunction of Saturn, Mars or Neptune, diseases of the throat, inflammation of larynx, sometimes danger by suffocation have been noted. These people are advised to take good care of themselves if they have a tendency to throat trouble and to take prophylactic measures. They should avoid overstraining their larynx and should they have special demands regarding the larynx, they are advised to take trouble in the methodical training of their vocal chords etc.
9. Zosma, in Leo is the part of the triangle of victim, saviour, or perpetrator. Zosma, a 2nd magnitude, triple star of yellow, blue and violet. Zosma is the star of egotism and selfindulgence.
Robson says that it has an unfortunate Saturn/Venus influence and is said to cause disgrace, melancholia, and a danger from poison It causes benefit by disgrace, selfishness, egotism, immorality, meanness, melancholy, unhappiness of mind and fear of poison, and gives an unreasonable, shameless and egotistical nature. Ebertin says that its reputation is that of giving an alert mind, but also inclination to melancholic moods. Conjunct with so called 'malefics', danger by poison and disease of the intestinal tract are indicated. These interpretations have to be considered with utmost caution and restraint.
None of these stars are totally evil and they can exist in the charts of wonderful people. But each one has its own wounds or worries that will either be owned and worked on or projected on another, who then seems to embody the worst side of the star’s energy.

THE FIXED STARS AND THE FOUR ANGLES (KENDRAS)
In working with parans, the angles are the four gateways that stars have into your chart. If a star does not touch one of the angles of a place or person’s chart (not visible), it was believed in ancient times that the star could not influence that place or person’s chart. This point is expanded in part 4 in the section on star phases.
The four angles-the Ascendant, MC, Descendant, and the Nadir-were seen long ago as four great pillars which held up the ceiling of the moving heavens. These were/are the channels by which the fixed stars translate their energy down to the earth. These points are the connections, the bridge, between us and the stars. Like modern astrological aspects, each particular angle combined its meaning with any star it encountered. However, the angles were connected to the timing of the expression and the intensity of the star energy; rather than altering and grading the expression, as is the case with modern aspect work.
The following guidelines are based primarily on the work of Anonymous and on the modern expression. Future research may bring the modern empirical expression closer to or further from the ancient opinions.
Fixed stars rising on the horizon or on the ascendant (lagna):
According to Anonymous if a star is rising and a planet is on the same or another angle, the expression of the star’s energy manifests throughout a person’s life and is considered to be in its strongest position. The star’s impact on your life, via the planet in paran, is the greatest it can express.
However, it would seem that the most notable feature of a star in the rising position, linked to a planet on any angle, is that its energy appears to peak early. The energy may well be manifested through the whole life but it seems to be very strong when the person is young.
Fixed stars on the culmination or mid heavens (karmasthan):
According to Anonymous if a star culminates and a planet is on the same or another angle, the expression of the star’s energy manifests at an early age, continues through a person’s life and gives him or her success in their city of birth. This seems very much like the rising point. One finds in working with this angle, however, that when a star is culminating, its expression is focused on the position held in the community, the career, or social standing. Thus the star’s energy gains expression in one’s life in the middle years, even while ambition or drive was established from quite a young age.
Laurence Olivier also had Mercury culminating as Alcyone reached its culmination. Here we have a fixed star coming to the same angle at the same time as a natal planet. This tends to give very strong outcomes. Alcyone is the alpha star of the Pleiades and as such is discussed later. The Pleiades are linked to mysticism but also to power, life, and death. Olivier did not want to work in mediocre plays or films. He was a Shakespearian specialist, recognized in his prime as a genius for his ability to give the words of the great bard the power and mystery they deserved. Laurence Olivier used his voice and oratory skills in his career (culminating), and the magic and charisma of that voice had as its source the very essence of the power of the Pleiades, Alcyone.

Fixed star on the Descendant (seventh house):
According to the author Anonymous , if a star is setting and a planet is on the same or another angle, the expression of the star’s energy manifests in middle age and in a foreign country. This statement seems to be holding true in modern work. For example, Charles Dickens, the great Victorian novelist, had Athena setting at the same time as his lupiter was setting. Athena is in the heel of Pollux, one of the Twins of Gemini. The presence of Athena in a chart implies that the person has a mission to go forth with an objective. Dickens gained success from an early age onward, but it was his works in the latter years of his life, in which he described the social injustice of Victorian England, which were most important to him. Indeed, social reform became the major driving force of his life in his later years.Athena did not cause Dickens to focus on issues of social justice. However, its presence in his chart, particularly sharing an angle with a natal planet, indicates that he would have a mission, a cause. Athena is the wounded heel. Dickens suffered hard labor in a children’s factory in his childhood, so in his later life and in keeping with the meaning of Jupiter, he strove to heal this wound by teaching others through his writings.
Fixed star on the Nadir(fourth house):
Anonymous also said that if a star is on the Nadir and a planet is on the same or another angle, the expression of the star’s energy manifests in old age “and their deaths are widely noted and much recognised.”
The Nadir is a great resource, for it represents what lies underneath the surface. Natal planets in this position may take many years before they are expressed, and similarly a star on this point is very strong but hidden, like an underground spring, not immediately apparent but once discovered a real treasure.
Dickens’s Jupiter also reached the Nadir at the same time as Betelgeuse reached its Nadir. Betelgeuse is the right shoulder of Orion and augurs success more than almost any other star in the sky. It shows honor and greatness. Linked with his Jupiter and on the Nadir, this implies that Dickens was able to gain much fame which lived on after his death.
Nativity with a star on the angle:
The strongest position for a star is when it occupies one of the angles at the time of birth. In this situation the energy of the star is focused on that point and functions from the day of birth to the day of death and sometimes even long after.
Pablo Picasso and Galileo Galilei were both born at the moment Sirius was rising. Sirius is the brightest star in the sky and is connected to great deeds, the mundane becoming sacred. It can burn if it is not used and its presence on theAscendant at birth is a huge indication that one is going to be asked to do great things. A person may fail in this endeavour but if he or she is brave enough to stride forward and go through the pain and turbulence implied by Sirius, then success is assured. For to be born with such a star rising, or on any of the other angles, implies that desired actions can have far-reaching consequences.

FIXED STARS ON PLANETS
After focusing the star into the chart, then find the meaning of the natal planet sharing the pivotal position with the star. All of the visible planets and the luminaries seem equally sensitive to contact with a star, with the Sun being the most sensitive but only because a star to the Sun will be expressed through one’s identity and sense of self and therefore more obvious to the astrologer’s eye.
The Sun or Surya
Why is the Sun given importance? First of all the Sun is one of the stars and is the ruler of our Solar System, where all the planets along with their satellites orbit around it and all life forms depend upon the Sun’s energy for existence.
If the Sun, the giver of life, vitality, individuality, status, creative energy, radiant inner self, essential values, etc., is affected, then personal identity is altered and becomes linked with the meaning and mythology of the star. The positive expression of the Sun is radiation of the spirit, creative and loving and pouring of self; while the negative expression is pride, arrogance, excessive desire to be special. As a ruler of the individuality, it represents the main direction and focus on what you want your life to take and your determination to accomplish the goals you set. It represnts : a) the heart in the physical body b) the eyes in the head c) the power of loving in the soul d) the understanding and the will to achieve one’s purpose in the mind.
The Sun is placed close to the meridian and on Regulas promotes the functions of ambition of power, honour and glory. If the Sun is close to the horizon and on Rigel, it gives vitality, energy and the capacity to achieve in early life.
In fiery signs the native is basically motivated by inspirations and aspirations, recharges energy through vigorous, physically demanding activity and by pursuing new visions for the future.
When dignified and well-placed, the Sun is the key to our chart, giving us energy and is symbolic of our Ego and reason for being, it is the core identity. It represents our conscious mind, will, ego, vitality, leadership and power of authority. The Sun rules important people, royalty. nobility. head of the State, the government and father. The Sun signifies our expression of confidence such as sports, the theatre and romance. The Sun influences the natural father, husband, male traits and children . The Sun’s forceful energy gives authority, ability to lead, rules royalty. There is a desire to rule and sway with incomparable judgement, truthfulness, humane but full of command, honourble, sumptuousness and magnificence.
When badly placed, the native is arrogant, proud, disdaining all men, purblind in sight and judgement, ruthless, troublesome, domineering, expensive, foolish, endowed with no gravity



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY

in words or soberness in action, hanging on other’s charity and thinks that all men are bounded by him.
Medically, the Sun has influence on our head, right eye, circulation of blood, heart, general vitality. The dieases related to the Sun are pitta disorder, constitutional strengths and weakness, vitality, heart and blood circulation related problems, bones, teeth, headache, baldness, stomach inflammations, fevers, head injuries, injuries through quadrupeds.
Brady says that if your Sun was linked to Capulus, one is strongly focused with forceflul action. However, if your Sun was linked with Vega, you could define yourself as a person with a magnetic type of personality.
Abraham Lincoln had his Sun rising as Aldebaran, one of the great royal stars of Persia, was in the Nadir. Aldebaran represents a ruler or person who is driven to friction with strong integrity or a noble cause. Being on the Nadir implies that he will be remembered in this light.
We see the two sides of Algol, the great star of female passion and intensity or ruthlessness, in the case of Adolf Hider, who had his Sun on the Nadir as Algol was setting. He is remembered (Nadir) for the ruthless events (Algol) in the later part of his life (setting). However to demonstrate the benefic effects of Algol-Jules Verne, the father of science fiction, and writer of short stories and novels such as Around the World in Eighty Days, Journey to the Center ofthe Earth and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, also had Algol rising with his Sun. The star rising showed that this star’s passion and intensity was connected to Verne’s massive outpouring of creative work.
The Moon or Chandra
The Moon, like the Sun, is another form of identity: how you feel, what you seek or find in your life. If the Moon is affected, then it alters what you believe in, what your ideals are, what you are passionate about. A Moon linked with Fomalhaut will be passionate about the arts or metaphysical subjects. It speaks of what pleases you, what nurtures you, what you therefore consciously or unconsciously seek and draw into your life.
Well-placed Moon makes one soft, tender, lover of honest and ingenuous sciences; delights in novelties, are unsteady, caring, peace loving, learn many occupations and trades.
An ill-placed Moon gives traits of a vagabond, idle person, hating labour, a drunkard, spiritless and spinless, delights to live beggarly and carelessly; content in neither good nor bad conditions of life.
Chandra affects our emotions, perceptual mind, feelings, desires, females, mental capacity, past experiences, early childhood.
Pathologically the Moon has control over raktha dhatu, face, blood, lymphs, stomach, lungs, left eye, breast, uterus, ovaries, fertility, nutrition, mucous membrane.
Diseases related to Chandra are Vata and Kapha disorders, mental and mental disorders, epilepsy, dullness, laziness, moodiness, blood, lympathic system, menstrual and hormonal disorders, tuberculosis.

People signified by the Moon are queens, ladies, women, common people, travellers, pilgrims, sailors, fisher-mongers, brewers, tapsters, coachmen, couriers, huntsmen, messangers, mariners, millers, malsters, drunkards, fisherwomen, charwomen, midwives, nurses, watermen, water-bearers, women carrying commodities in the streets.
Jules Verne was born on a day when the Moon set as Altair rose. Altair is the alpha star of Aquila the Eagle. Altair is the flight of the Eagle, to go higher and in a bolder fiction than anybody has before, to soar to unexplored great heights. Linked to his Moon via the Ascendant, this implies that as a young boy Jules Verne quested for adventure, for new places. As he became older, he found an oudet for all of this in his writing. He did not travel physically to these places but rather, moon-motivated, he traveled to them emotionally.
The Moon connected with Facies, a star from the constellation Sagittarius. Facies is in the face of the Archer and represents war as a concept in the human way of life. It has no mercy and is ruthless in its aggression and its attitudes. Linked to the Moon it implies a person who loves the combative way of life, loves the military and may even be sadistically inclined. Adolf Hitler had Facies culminating as his Moon culminated (manifesting itself in his career). Margaret Thatcher, long-standing right wing Prime Minister of the UK, whose finest hour was the Falkiands War, had Facies setting (in the latter part of her life) as her Moon was on her Nadir.
The Moon is also how we receive nurturing, and if connected to a rising star then that star’s energy will give a description of your view of your mother, or what your mother taught or instilled in you, because the star is most active in the early part of your life. Prince Charles has Murzims rising as his Moon culminates. Murzims is the star in the paws of the dog of Canis Major. It is called the Announcer, and its meaning is to speak out or have something to say. This star indicates that Charles sees his mother as one who speaks out or has a message to announce. In adulthood this influenced his own actions as well as the type of woman to whom he would be drawn. He married the shy, young Diana, only to find that she was also a person who spoke out; she was a person with something to say to the world.
The Moon’s nodes: Rahu (North) and Ketu (South) – The Invisible Planets.
In Hindu mythology there is a wonderful story that describes how the gods and the demons once formed an alliance to produce a nectar that could give them immortality. This is the story of the churning of the milk-ocean and the descent of Lord Vishnu as the Kurma avatara, the divine tortoise. When the nectar that was churned from this ocean was being served to the gods, a demon, disguised as a god, sat between the Sun and the Moon in an attempt to procure the nectar. When he was detected by the Sun and the Moon, Lord Vishnu immediately severed his head from his body. Unfortunately, it was not fast enough, for the demon had already tasted a small quantity of the nectar and had become immortal. Ever since, this demon is said to wreak vengeance on the Sun and Moon whenever they come near. The head of this great demon is known as Rahu and his tail is known as Ketu.
In Hindu Astrology Rahu and Ketu are known as two invisible planets. They are enemies of the Sun and the Moon, who at certain times of the year(during conjunction or opposition) swallow the Sun or the Moon causing either a solar or a lunar eclipse.In Sanskrit this is known as grahana or seizing.

What perhaps sounds like a childish story is a powerful metaphor for what actually happens when an eclipse takes place. Rahu and Ketu are the astronomical points in the sky respectively called the north and south lunar nodes.
To the observer on earth, the paths of the sun and the moon appear to be two great circles projected on the celestial sphere (see the diagram). The Sun’s path, the solar ecliptic, makes a complete revolution in one year. At the same time, the Moon’s circular path is completed in about one month. Every month the moon will overtake the sun which moves more slowly. This is called new moon or in Sanskrit, amavasya. Usually the moon’s path passes above or below the sun’s path and no eclipse occurs. But, periodically the moon overtakes the sun at the place where their paths intersect. This causes the sun or the moon to be hidden from the earth’s view and is thus called a solar or lunar eclipse. These places of intersection are the north and south lunar nodes, or as they are referred to in Hindu mythology, Rahu and Ketu. Therefore, in the symbolic language of mythology, Rahu and Ketu are said to “swallow up” the Sun and the Moon. The ancient Hindu observers of the sky were aware of the cause of the solar and lunar eclipses and so described the process in the language of metaphor.
Basically, a Node or nodal point represents a cross-over point where diverse energies become momentarily fused into Oneness, a kind of focal point, too. The Moon’s Nodes are the two points, exactly opposite to one another, where the Moon passes, in it’s orbit, from above to below the plane of the ecliptic and vice versa. What is the plane of the ecliptic, you might ask? The Sun spins, like all the planets. Therefore, it has an equator. If you were to extend the equator of the Sun out in all directions to the limits of the solar system, the resulting plane is the plane of the ecliptic. All planets are in constant motion in relation to this imaginary plane. The Moon and its Nodes are also in constant motion in relation to the Earth, to the Sun and to the zodiac.
Physics and astronomy tell us that anything that spins creates a magnetic field... so it is with the Moon orbiting the Earth... both are spinning... in themselves, around each other and around the Sun. The Nodes of the Moon are the focal points of a magnetic field that influences all life on Earth. Furthermore, these Nodes themselves are moving slowly in relation to the signs of the zodiac as seen from our perspective. When you were born, the Nodes of the Moon were in a particular pair of zodiac signs, each opposing the other.



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY

Because of the enormous influence of the associated magnetic field and the influence of the pair of the zodiac signs and their associated issues, your very life’s path and purpose are molded and influenced by these Nodes. The Nodes of the Moon, when considered in the natal horoscope, can tell a lot about your life’s path, purpose, lessons, gifts, weaknesses, etc.
Mercury or Buddha
The principle of Mercury is communication, conscious mind with logic and rational thinking through skills of perception, speech or writing. The positive is expressed through the creative use of skill or intelligence, reason and the the power of discrimination while the negative is expressed through misuse of skill or intelligence, amorality, opinionated and one-sided communication. Mercury also symbolizes mentality, ideas, methods, information, media, manual dexterity, mechanical skills, communication. Mercury acts on the perspective and intellectual faculties, stimulates curiosity and desire for knowledge, promotes business activities and interest in learning. The negative side of Mercury are carelessness, poor judgement, in speech and writing, business administrations, loss of business, fraud, deception, lying, slander, adverse acts of servants or employees due to dishonesty, etc.
In fiery signs thoughts are influenced by one’s aspirations, beliefs, hopes and future vision and skills and speech are expressed demonstratively and enthusiastically. In earthy signs, thoughts are influenced by practical considerations and coloured by traditional attitude while skills and speech are expressed persistently, patiently, specifically and with caution. In airy signs, thoughts are influenced by abstract ideals and social considerations while skills and speech are expressed objectively, articulately and with understanding of the principles involved. In watery signs, thoughts are influenced by one’s deep feelings and yearnings while skills and speech are expressed sensitively, emotionally, and intuitively
Mercury in fixed star work is about ideas and intellect. It may affect the way you speak or it may emphasize all things Mercurial in your life. If you have Capulus, the star of aggressive male energy, linked to your Mercury, you are a very direct speaker, freely speaking your mind for better or worse. However, if Mercury is connected to Rigel, the star of the educator and teacher, then you may well be an educator, wanting to impart knowledge.
The nature of Mercury is either male or female, according to its placement. If it is in conjunction with male planets, then Mercury is male. The traits of Mercury are either good or bad and at times it is difficult to figure out as Mercury rules the animal spirit and is the author of subtlety, tricks, devices and perjury.
The anatomy and illnesses related to Mercury are vertigos, lethargies, giddiness in the head, madness, any disease of the brain, stammering, imperfection of the tongue, vain imaginations, defects of the memory, dumbness, evil-tongue, intellectual impairment.
People signified by Mercury are literary men and women, philosophers, mathematicians, astrologers, merchants, secretaries, diviners, sculptors, poets, orators, advocates, schoolmasters, stationers, painters, exchangers of money, attorneys, ambassabors, commissioners, clerks, solicitors, thieves, grammarians, tailors, messangers, footmen, etc.
Lewis Carroll, the man who gave us the character of Alice in Wonderland at birth had Mercury set as Formalhaut, one of the great stars of Persia from the constellation Piscis Australis, was culminating. Formalhaut is linked to romance and poetic ability. Thus,



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 61 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
Carrol’s highly imaginative, idealistic, romantic, fantasy writing indicates that this imaginative expression in his speech or writing will form part of his career or become part of his social status.
On the other side of this coin there is a star called Wega, the alpha star of the constellation Lyra, the Harp of Orpheus, which covers everything it touches in enchanting charisma. On the day that Hitler was born, Mercury set as Wega rose. This is an indication of a most charismatic and spell-creating orator. The star does not describe the way he will use his charismatic skills, merely that he has them focused on his Mercury.
Venus or Shukra
Venus likes the finer things of life as it is a ‘feel good planet’. Venus is in charge of relationships, love, money, art and aesthetics. This loveliest and brightest planet rules diplomacy, co-opertion and strategy.
When dignified Venus signifies a quiet person, pleasant, neat and spruce, clean in apparel, often prefering to have relationships and affectionate and amorous enticements, delights in music and parties, cheerful, virtuous, etc.
When badly placed, the person is riotous, expensive, loose in morals and prefers lewd company, unlawful, incestuous, adulterous, ill-repute, visiting alehouses, taverns, bars, lazy, atheist, etc.

The urge of Venus is represented through social contacts and love urge, urge to express affection, urge for pleasures.
The needs are symbolized by feeling close to one another, need for comfort and harmony, the need to give self’s emotions, share vigorous activities and mutual aspirations and enthusiasm. The positive expressions are love (give and take) sharing, generosity while the negative expressions are affection and appreciation are expressed energetically, directly and grandly.
The placement of Venus describes your inclination towards romance, marriage and other partnerships and the pursuit of pleasure. Venus also represents emotions of sympathy, love, sex, attraction, beauty, refinement, culture, expression of art, luxury, harmony, obedience to low, conventions and propriety. Good aspects to Venus brings happiness, prosperity, enjoyment and pleasures. Afflications to Venus brings trouble, scandal, disease, discredit



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY

through the opposite sex, loss in dealing with Venusian subjects and occupations. It also induces extravagance and unbecoming conduct.
In fiery signs, affection and appreciation are expressed energetically, directly and grandly. In earthy signs affection and appreciation are expressed tangibly, dependably and physically. In airy signs, affection and appreciation are expressed through intense intellectual communication and a sense of companionship. In watery signs, affection and appreciation are expressed emotionally and sympathetically, leading to a feeling of deep merging.
Venus in fixed star work seems to be strongly connected to the arts as well as to ideas about harmony and relating. Thus, it can affect your private life, friendships, and alliances, as well as push you into some form of creative expression. Venus connected to Capulus, makes one to have little concern for harmony, balance, or social skills, whereas if you had Venus connected to Diadem, a star of female sacrifice, you may be very self-sacrificing in personal relationships.
Princess Diana, with her Venus on Algol did not care for anyone, though being watched every moment during her urge for love relationship with Dodi but it unfortunately ended in a tragic disaster. Elizabeth Taylor, with her many marriages and turbulent private life, was born on the day that Venus set as Procyon culminated. Procyon is the alpha star of Canis Minor. Procyon comes before “the shining one,” Sirius, and relates to rash actions that do not last. Linked to her Venus and connected to the MC, one of the ways she is known in the world is for her many failed marriages.
Leonardo da Vinci, whose Venus was setting while the alpha star of the Pleiades, Alcyone, was setting. This is the same star that Laurence Olivier had linked to his Mercury, but with Leonardo its mysterious energy is focused on Venus, manifesting in many of his works and drawings and most of all in the faint smile and mystery of the Mona Lisa.
Mars or Mangala
Mangala, the auspicious, the favourable, having its direction of contemplation towards the supreme goal. Mangala empowers one to use weapons of aggression to protect and attack; whose power is used in sports,hunting, archery; efforts to reach and subjugate distant objects; with a boundless thirst for the unknown and an urge to achieve difficult objects that needs strife and energy. Managala is also known as the Hirnyagarbha or the golden egg or unknown depths in time. By the jutting arrow that indicates the process of articulation, one attains full strature. Mangala is the pain of the new born breaking from the egg (womb) and going into a world full of violence, accidents, wars, destruction; and with prowess he breaks the veil over its inner potentials to march towards progress and growth. Mars has no fear to go beyond one’s capacities to reach higher levels of existence by abandoning materialistic way of life and mundane living to achieve everlasting life. That is why the world had knights, martyrs or shaheeds, who have renounced this world through efforts requiring enormous sacrifices, for the spiritual life beyond the gates of death.



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY

When dignified and well-placed, one is victorious in war, courageous and invincible, bold, confident, challenging, valiant, loves confrontations, hazarding himself to all perils, never submissive and fights all things prudently to victory.
When ill-placed then he is a prattler without modesty or honesty, loves slaughter, murder, thievery, promotes sedation, highway thief, a traitor, rash, obsence, inhuman, treacherous, violent and with no fear of God.
The principle desire of Mars is towards direct action, initiative, physical energy, drive and dynamism. Its urge is represented through self-assertion, aggressive urge, sex urge, urge to act decisively, use of power and initiative, confidence, enthusiasm, etc. Positive expression is expressed through courage, daring, enterprise, will power, etc. directed to legitimate aim; while the negative expression is expressed through impatience, violence, improper use of force or threat.
Mars governs the red corpuscles of the blood and gives vigour, vitality, strengthens the desires, the apetite and the passions and is necessary in the practical affairs of life. A wellplaced Mars endows powerful energy and an indomitable will to succeed. An afflicted Mars without essential dignity can mean accidents, injuries, violence, etc., according to the sign and house concerned.
Mars in fiery signs, asserts self through direct physical action, initiative, outgoing radition of energy, physical energy stimulated by constant movement, confidence, enthusiasm and dynamic action. In earthy signs, Mars asserts itself through concrete achievement requiring patience and persistence. Physical energy is stimulated by hard work; self discipline and carrying out one’s duties. In airy signs, Mars asserts itself through expression of ideas, active communication and energetic imagination.

When Mars is linked to a fixed star, motivation, sexual energy, aggression, or drive are colored by the mythology and process of the star. Mars repersents your ability to focus energy and move it toward an emotional or physical goal without consideration of others. A star like Alcyone with Mars could result in idealism without drive, or a person who is strongly focused on higher ideals or the mysteries of physical or spiritual life. Immanuel Kant had Mars setting as Alcyone was on the Nadir. His life work was in the field of philosophy. In contrast to Kant’s Mars, Joan of Arc’s Mars was rising as Antares was on the



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY

Nadir. Antares is the heart of the Scorpion and indicates great passions, transformations, warrior-ship. And Joan of Arc, of course, was burnt to death by the English for her part in leading the French nation to victory against the English.
Jupiter or Brihaspati
In the Rigveda, Upanishads and Puranas, Jupiter is given names like Bhrahamanspati, Brihaspati, both deriving from the same root, Brahma. “Bri” means to expand and grow, i.e., Wisdom enables the growth and expansion in the universe. In the Rigveda, Brihaspati is invoked as a mighty power which can be invoked for immense protection and great prosperity. Born of the sage Angira, yellow in colour, the colour of intellect, auspicious for rituals and devotional activities, Jupiter sits on a water lily of four arms. 1) a garland of rudraksha beads 2) a begging bowl 3) a mace and 4) bestowing blessings, indicating the right performance of duties and involved in actions to fulfill the will of the higher power. The chariot of Jupiter is called Nitighosa drawn by eight horses. “Niti” stands for prosperity as well as the science of morality, ethics and moral fulfillment. “Ghosha” stand for thunder as well as proclamation of the arrival of righteousness, the law and code of truth and right action. The eight horses yoked to the chariot represent the eight perfections in latency.

In the lowest aspect of human consciousness, Jupiter represents the love or desire for wealth, ease and desire of material accumulation. In the higher aspect of human consciousness, Jupiter represents benevolence, conscience and judicial consideration. In the highest aspect of human consciousness, Jupiter bestows wisdom, knowledge or divine things, reverence



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY

and spirituality. Jupiter preserves life, safeguards health, prevents accidents or renders them harmless, gives honour, bestows power and wealth.
In fiery signs, inner faith comes with one who is outgoing, enthusiastic, assertive, physically active and opportunities are stimulated by taking risks to try new things. In earthy signs, inner faith comes when one tunes into practicality, dependability, and the experiences of the senses. Opportunities are stimulated through hard work and responsibilities. In airy signs, inner faith is stimulated through exploring new ideas, communicating with new people and through social improvement. In watery signs, inner faith is stimulated through depth of emotional experience, positive expression of one’s compassion and imagination. Opportunities come when one is sensitive and caring towards others and when one intuitively follows one’s inner yearnings.
Stars linked to Jupiter will be emphasized in their expression, as well as affecting the way you learn and expand your world. You may see the big picture and rush toward it or see the big picture and run away from it. When Regulus, one of the Royal Stars of Persia which promises success as long as revenge is avoided, is with Jupiter it can be a very powerfull combination, suggesting great success or a great struggle to avoid revenge. Jupiter is a magnifier: it takes the energy of the star and expresses it to the world in a magnified form.
Adoff Hitler had Facies rising at the same time as his Jupiter: Facies, the essence of war and combat, is magnified by its contact with Jupiter.
On a brighter note, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart had Spica and Jupiter culminating together. Spica, the alpha star of Virgo, is the gift of genius. Linked to the MC of Mozart, it indicates that we will know his work and know him as a genius-a clear instance of Jupiter magnifying the star it touched.
Saturn or Shani
Saturn is born of the union of the Sun and Chhaya. Saturn is the projection of the solar radiance through the veil of matter; the pure radiance of the Sun is obstructed by matter. All the divine offsprings of the Sun have the common feature of carrying and furthering the divine mission of the Light, the victory of the spiritual forces over materiality. Saturn causes frustration with the material world and spirituality is caused by the denial of materialism. Saturn is Father Time, Chronos, the Planet of Karma, discipline, responsibility. Saturn is the best teacher. Saturn teaches us to manage our limitations.
Another name for Saturn is Saptarchi, meaning the seven flames, or rays and the seven human temperaments: 1) Will 2)Wisdom 3) Activity of thought 4) Search for truth 5) Religious Protection 6) Aristist, fine art through pure form and 7) Mystics and Visionaries.
When dignified, Saturn is profound in imagination, severe in acts, reserved in words, sparse in giving, patient in labour, grave in disputing, studious, solicitous and austere in all manner of actions.



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY

In anatomy and illnesses, Saturn causes troubles with the right ear, teeth, proceeding of cold, dry and melancholy, rheums, consumptions palsies, tremblings, vain fears, dropsy, apoplexies, the hand and foot gout, , etc.
The people signified by Saturn are day labourers, undertakers, scavengers, carters, gardeners, dyers of black cloth, herdsmen, sheperds, cow-keepers, malsters, chimney sweepers, sextons of churches, colliers, elders, etc.
The principle of Saturn is contraction, discipline and hard work. It’s urge is to defend self’s structure and integrity towards safety and security through tangible achievement. Positive expression comes through disciplined effort, acceptance of duties and responsibilities, patience, organization, reliability,etc; while negative expression comes through self restriction through too much reliance on self and lack of faith, rigidity, coldness, defensiveness, grappling inhibitions, fearfulness and negativity, etc.
During each 30 years of its journey through the 12 signs, Saturns brings in challenges to bring in new awareness or to face the consequences of having failed to gain the wisdom required to do so. Sturnd denotes : 1. the necessity for obedience to law. Necessity is the mother of inventions. 2. the value of labour, patience, intelligence and economical use of time and material. 3. protection and limits the Soul till it is capable of leaving its earthly conditions and entering its spiritual heritage.
Saturn in fiery signs, stabilizes one’s identity and expresses creative energy with moreregularity and objectivity with efforts to master the physical world and developing a systematic approach. In earthy signs, Saturn stabilizes one’s efficiency and precision in work and handling daily responsibility with efforts to master the physical world and developing a systematic approach. In airy signs, Saturn stabilizes one’s thinking and disciplines one’s mind without lapsing into negative thinking and efforts are made to handle social responsibilities with sincerity while maintaining a detached perspective and thinking with clarity, practicality and effectively. In watery signs, there is the need to stabilize one’s emotions and sensitivities, expressing feelings while simultaneously developing more detachment from them. Efforts should be put into expressing feeling with self acceptance while disciplining over-sensitivty. A star linked with Saturn has a lasting effect. It relates to what you build with your life or what you leave behind after death. It will express itself in issues of leadership and may even be projected onto the father or authority figures. Saturn linked with Castor, for example, describes a leading writer or communicator who leaves behind a body of work or ideas. John Lennon had Castor on his Nadir as his Saturn rose. Once again, we see the impact of the Nadir in how Lennon’s recognition continued after death as his music and songs gained greater acclaim.

In contrast Oliver Cromwell-the man who led the English civil war, overthrew the monarchy, and became Lord Protector of England-had Saturn on the Nadir as Procyon rose. Procyon was the star connected to Venus in Elizabeth Taylor’s chart: to rise quickly but not to last-which her marriages didn’t. After Cromwell’s death, his body of work was destroyed and the monarchy returned to power.
Uranus or Prajapati
The principle of Uranus is individualistic freedom, freedom of self ego with an urge towards originality, differentiation and independence from tradition and a need to rely on one’s own resources and work.
The positive expression is attunement to truth; originality, inventiveness, directed experimentation, respect for freedom; while the negative expression is willfulness, restless impatience, constant need for excitement, rebellion, extremism and purposeless change.
In society it rules radical ideas and people and revolutionary events that upset established structures. Being highly unorthodox, it identifies the unusual or unique. It gives tendencies with potential involvement with arcane studies, science, technology, computers and the media.
Neptune or Varun
The principle of Neptune is transcendent freedom, freedom from self ego with an urge to escape from the limitations of one’s self and of the material world. Needs to experience a oneness with life and a complete merger with the whole.
Its positive expression is, attunement with the whole realization of spiritual dimention of experience; all-encompassing compassion living an ideal; while the negative expression is self-destruction, escapism, evasion of responsibilities and refusal to face one’s motives and to commit self to anything.
At the lower level, Neptune is a planet of deception ruling the oppressed, abandoned, the misfits of society. At a higher level it is the planet of enlightment, ruling visionaries who represent spiritualism, mysticism and ideals.
Are these two outer planets, affecting generations, so malefic? This view is due to a shallow and shortsighted view of character and purpose.
The evil ascribed to them are: • Due to ignorance of their proper purpose and • Wrapping their forces into improper hand of activity.
Both are spiritual planets, who hasten human evolution. When an individual’s evolution is retarded, Uranus and Neptune remove them, and these hindrances are in the form of ignorance, greed, laziness, lust, tyranny and prejudices. Hence habits, characteristics, institutions, etc. to which these vices are attached are assaulted or overthrown by Uranus and Neptune.



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY

Further, obstinacy and refusal to apply spiritual principles to life cause these transcendental planets to act with tremendous malevolence. The vibrations of these planets are of such high frequency that they tend to break down the insulation in the brain cells and nerve fibres of the body, unless a proper outlet is found for their activities.
Pluto or Yama
The principle of Pluto is transformation, transmutation, elimination, etc. with an urge to total rebirth and penetrate to the core of experience and the need to go off the old and refine oneself.
The positive expression is the need to focus one’s mind and will power on one’s own transformation and transmute one’s deepest desires and compulsions through effort and intensity of experience; while the negative expression is compulsive expression of subconscious cravings, willful manipulation of others to serve one’s own ends, ruthlessly using any means to avoid the plain of facing one’s self and infatuation with power. As Pluto is related to our karmic relations, it transforms us with new experiences that destroys the old and useless forms and thought with new and spiritualizing vibrations through our cosmic journey.
THE SUN AND THE STARS
Star phases have not been used in astrology for nearly two thousand years. Yet this technique was the predominant method used when fixed stars held the center stage of an astrologer’s life. As we became disconnected from the sky; the importance of star phases faded, not because of faulty technique but because it was a visually based system. The “phasing” of a star-that is to say its rising with the Sun on a particular calendar date, its period of visibility in the night sky and its period of invisibility when it was not present in the night Sky-was one of the major tools for defining the calendar, the seasons, and the weather. In addition, the periods when a star was missing from the night sky; and its subsequent return, provided foundations for both myths and religious practices that the Egyptians raised to their highest form of expression.
The phases of the stars are the result of the combination of three factors:
• The first is that the stars do not reside on the ecliptic and will therefore co-rise and co-set for a given latitude on different degrees of the ecliptic.
• The second is that the Sun; which defines the ecliptic, will rise and set with the same degree of the ecliptic for a particular day.
• And the third and most obvious factor, is that stars are only visible when the Sun is below the horizon.

THE STARS TO USE TO DETERMINE THE HELIACAL RISING STAR OF THE DAY
According to Cyril Faggan "Heliacal" does not mean "with the Sun," but "before the Sun" (heliacal rising) and "after the Sun" (heliacal setting). When a planet or a fixed star rises or sets precisely with the Sun, it is referred to as its cosmic rising and cosmic setting respectively.
In determining the nature of a particular day by establishing what stars were the heliacal rising or setting, a natural question arises: which stars to use? There are eight thousand visible stars, so this question is best answered by Ptolemy, who says:
As for our not inserting some of the fainter of the stars named by the ancients... one must concede, if the question is not weighty, that especially the last and first phases of such small stars are altogether phantasms because they are hard to distinguish and hard to consider anyway. Then, it is quite clear that, since this first publication is submitted by us only as far as fixed stars of the first and second magnitude for the reasons set out.
Ptolemy goes on to explain that other, fainter stars would only be in conflict with the brighter stars and points out that it would be incorrect to have the heliacal rising attributed to a faint star when it is also the heliacal rising of a bright star.
The table below lists Ptolemy’s stars of the first and second magnitude and should be used as a guide for determining which stars can be the heliacal rising star for the day of birth.

The noon point of that map (like Greenwich) is the Great Pyramid of Giza. Thousands of years ago, Egypt was known as the Land of Khem. The Khema were a group of seven major stars (in the constellation of Taurus), known today as the Pleiades (29 Taurus).
If the map is placed with the Khema over the Land of Khem (Egypt)- specifically, directly over the apex of the Great Pyramid - then Taurus falls over the Taurus Mountains of southern Turkey. Ursa Major, the Great Bear, rambles over Russia; the head of Draco the Dragon coils up over China; Orion (the warrior) over Iran/Iraq. Aries the Ram over Rome, and Capricorn (identified with the god Pan) falls over Panama, Panuco, and Mayapan (the old name of the Yucatan). Aquila the Eagle spans the United States. The analogies are obvious, and quite impressive. This is one of the clearest examples of the law of 'As Above, So Below'."
Comets appearing in constellations are said to mark the rise and fall of nations associated with that nations' respective constellations. An impressive example of this was pointed by Cheiro in his book entitled Cheiro's World Predictions (1928). Cheiro noted that, on June 8th, 1918, a bright supernova appeared in the constellation of Aquila the Eagle, which signifies the United States. As reported at the time: "The brightness of Nova Aquila in its early days was greater than that of any Nova since the year 1604". What is even more remarkable is that June 8th saw the only solar eclipse in the year 1918, and this eclipse was conjunct Jupiter, the planet of rulers, and squared by Mars, the planet of war. "The solar eclipse and supernova(One of the most energetic explosive events known is a supernova. These occur at the end of a star's lifetime, when its nuclear fuel is exhausted and it is no longer supported by the release of nuclear energy. If the star is particularly massive, then its core will collapse and in so doing will release a huge amount of energy. This will cause a blast wave that ejects the star's envelope into interstellar space. The result of the collapse

may be, in some cases, a rapidly rotating neutron star that can be observed many years later as a radio pulsar) in Aquila the Eagle in early-June of 1918 coincided with the United States entering the Great War in Europe (i.e. World War I) at the time and the subsequent turning point in that war. By July of that year, American troops backed the Allies in starting to reverse the gains made by Germany and the Central powers up to that point, and, by November of 1918, the tide has turned completely with Germany's surrender and an Allied victory.
"Thus, a profound and rare astronomical event occurred - the supernova in Aquila the Eagle along with a solar eclipse - in June of 1918 that marked a critical juncture at which the United States started to become an important world power. American involvement in the European war in 1918 was the first time the U.S. took on the role of a world power. From that time on, marked the rise of the United States to the ruling world power. This historical turning point for America was reflected in the sky according to the law: 'As Above, So Below'"

In addition to the twelve signs of the zodiac the ancients also described thirty-six other constellations that were associated with each ten-degree section of the zodiac. The oldest records of them have been found inside coffin lids in the 10th Egyptian dynasty about 2100 BC. The thirty-six are also mentioned in the Babylonian Enuma Anu Enlil about four centuries later. Through the expansion of the Persian and later Babylonian empires these 48 constellations were adopted and renamed by the Greeks, although the current rulership of the decanates according to the sequence of signs of the same element in the order of cardinal, fixed, mutable is found in Hindu astrology rather than in the Greek which had different rulerships.

USE OF DECANATES IN MUNDANE ASTROLOGY
Alfred John Pearce pointed out that the Roman Empire and the Papal power were greatly aff Richard Hinckley Allen’s book 'Star names- Their lore and meaning' Richard Hinckley Allen’s book 'Star names- Their lore and meaning' Richard Hinckley Allen’s book 'Star names- Their lore and meaning' Richard Hinckley Allen’s book 'Star names- Their lore and meaning' 'Names of Stars from period of Vedas' ected by the passage of Regulus through the sign Leo by which Rome is ruled. This star entered Leo in 293 B.C., and the power of Rome became fully established. The approximate period during which it remains in one sign is 2160 years, and it therefore requires about 720 years to pass through a single decanate, which it does in a retrograde direction. Unfortunately the exact position of the vernal equinox in the constellations is not known with any accuracy, but there seems to be no doubt that the first point of Aries in the zodiac of signs coincided with that in the constellation zodiac in about 500 A.D. In 571 A.D. it entered the Sagittarius decanate corresponding with the great increase in Papal power; in 1291 it left that decanate and in the same year the Holy Land was entirely lost. When Regulus left the term of Jupiter in 1507 the efforts of Luther were disturbing the power of the Popes, and when, in 1868, its influence began to be transferred to Virgo on account of its having passed the 29th degree of Leo, the French troops left Rome and the temporal power of the Pope was overthrown.

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY DOWN THE AGES.
Untiring efforts of many people have aroused the interest in and revival of the study of fixed stars. It is worth mentioning a few:
Thales of Miletus ('discovered' Ursa Minor)
There is considerable agreement that Thales was born in Miletus in Greek Ionia in the mid 620s BCE and died in about 546 BCE, but even those dates are indefinite. Aristotle, the major source for Thales's philosophy and science, identified Thales as the first person to investigate the basic principles, the question of the originating substances of matter and, therefore, as the founder of the school of natural philosophy. Thales was interested in almost everything, investigating almost all areas of knowledge, philosophy, history, science, mathematics, engineering, geography, and politics. He proposed theories to explain many of the events of nature, the primary substance, the support of the earth, and the cause of change. Thales was much involved in the problems of astronomy and provided a number of explanations of cosmological events which traditionally involved supernatural entities. His questioning approach to the understanding of heavenly phenomena was the beginning of Greek astronomy. Thales's hypotheses were new and bold, and in freeing phenomena from godly intervention, he paved the way towards scientific endeavour. He founded the Milesian school of natural philosophy, developed the scientific method, and initiated the first western enlightenment. A number of anecdotes is closely connected to Thales's investigations of the cosmos. When considered in association with his hypotheses they take on added meaning and are most enlightening. Thales was highly esteemed in ancient times, and a letter cited by Diogenes Laertius, and purporting to be from Anaximenes to Pythagoras, advised that all our discourse should begin with a reference to Thales.
Callimachus reported that Thales 'discovered' Ursa Minor. This means only that he recognized the advantages of navigating by Ursa Minor, rather than by Ursa Major, as was the preferred method of the Greeks. Ursa Minor, a constellation of six stars, has a smaller orbit than does the Great Bear, which means that, as it circles the North Pole, Ursa Minor changes its position in the sky to a lesser degree than does the Great Bear. Thales offered this sage advice to the mariners of Miletus, to whom it should have been of special value because Miletus had developed a maritime trade of economic importance.
The next landmark in our study of Greek constellation lore is Eratosthenes (c.276–c.194 BC), to whom an essay called the Catasterisms is attributed. Eratosthenes was a Greek scientist and writer who worked in Alexandria at the mouth of the Nile. The Catasterisms gives the mythology of 42 separate constellations (the Pleiades cluster is treated individually), with a listing of the main stars in each figure. The version of the Catasterisms that survives is only a summary of the original, made at some unknown date, and it is not even certain that the original was written by the real Eratosthenes; hence the author of the Catasterisms is usually referred to as pseudo-Eratosthenes. The antiquity of his sources is certain, though, because he quotes in places from a long-lost work on astronomy by Hesiod (c.700 BC)

Marcus Manilius, a Roman author of whom virtually nothing is known, wrote a book called Astronomica around the year AD 15, clearly influenced by the Phaenomena of Aratus. Manilius’s book deals mostly with astrology rather than astronomy, but it contains numerous insights into constellation lore.
Ptolemy (Claudius Ptolemaeus)
Mathematician, astronomer and geographer; worked c. 127 - 145 AD (Alexandria, Egypt)
Our knowledge about Ptolemy is based exclusively on his works; nothing is known about his life.
Ptolemy was an excellent geometrician, and his works on geometry are among his best. He was also a gifted mathematician, devising new geometrical theorems and proofs. Being primarily interested in astronomy, he studied the projection of points on the celestial sphere onto three perpendicular planes defined by the horizon, the meridian and the perpendicular, a system still used today.
By far the most important of his works is the Almagest. Its original title was The Mathematike Syntaxis ("The Mathematical Collection"). It was such an encyclopaedic summary of astronomical knowledge that it soon became known as Ho megas astonomos "The Great Astronomer"). Arab astronomers of the 9th century considered it Megiste ("Greatest"), added the Arabian definite article al and referred to it as al-Megiste ("The Greatest") or Almagest.
The Almagest describes in great detail the arrangement of the sun, the planets and all stars in a system where the Earth is at rest in the centre of the universe. It also contains a star catalogue of 1,022 stars, an effort not even surpassed by Kepler in the 15th century.
Ptolemy modified the mathematical model of deferents and epicycles (circles moving on circles) that existed at the time to describe the observed movement of the planets and improved its capability to predict their movement. His system, known as the Ptolemaic system, became the accepted view of the universe for 1,400 years. (During the 16th century the increased accuracy of star observations made it impossible to ignore the discrepancies between Ptolemy's system and actual star movement, and Galilei began to teach that the Earth revolves around the Sun.)
Other works of Ptolemy include several books on mathematics and geometry; • five books on optics, where he discusses the theory of refraction and is the first known astronomer to discuss refraction of light from celestial bodies at different elevation from the horizon; • eight books on geography, which tabulate places of the known world in latitude and longitude and give instructions how to construct maps; and • thirteen books on astronomy, known since the 9th century as the Almagest. • but his MAGNUM OPES for us astrologers is ‘The Tetrabibleos’.

Ptolemy's geographical works were of lesser quality. They contained many errors: The equator was too far north, the circumference of the Earth was 30% too small (other scientists had already established much more correct values), Asia reached much further east than in reality, and the Indian Ocean was bounded in the south by another continent. Scientifically the most important contribution was his application of mathematics to the mapping of positions on Earth according to latitude and longitude.
Ptolemy's reputation as an excellent geometer and astronomer made his geographical works more credible than they should have been, and their influence was far-reaching. Columbus used them in the 15th century as an argument that it would not be difficult to reach India going west. The belief in a great southern continent was not abandoned until 1775, when James Cook returned from his voyage to the Southern Hemisphere.
The Chinese
The Chinese have been observing the sky for several millennia, making them the oldest civilization with a continuous astronomical record. The Chinese required that their astronomers were correctly able to predict astronomical events, such as eclipses; otherwise, they were executed.
As far as cataloguing went, Shi Shen, Gan De, and Wu Xian (370-270 B.C.) in sum recorded 1464 stars in 284 constellations. This is 200 years before the first western catalogue (by Hipparchus). In A.D. 310, Astronomer Royal Qian Luozhi had a bronze celestial globe made with stars that were color-coded as to their source. From the Han Dynasty, there are carvings that show constellations and asterisms with stars linked to delineate the various groups.
The sky was also divided into Nine Fields, which involved the circumpolar region and eight other divisions. The eight other divisions can be related to eight hexagrams which appear in the Yi Jing (The Book of Changes), which dates from the 2nd century B.C.
The Chinese constellations were in the form of Five Palaces; the number five possibly results from the five elements of earth, fire, water, metal, and wood.
• The Palace of Purple Tenuity was the circumpolar area.
• The Palace of the East was the Azure Dragon.
• The Palace of the South was the Vermillion Bird.
• The Palace of the West was the White Tiger.
• The Palace of the North was the Dark Warrior, represented by an intertwined turtle and snake.
Yet another type of sky division were the Lunar Mansions, which goes back to at least the 5th century B.C. It involves 28 divisions, based upon the lunar sidereal period being 27.32 days. This was of particular importance in astrology.
For charts, the earliest known dates to around A.D. 700. Though it has no grid lines, it contains over 1350 stars, and is a flat version of the Qian Luozhi globe. Nearly 400 years later, in A.D. 1094, the Song Dynasty created star charts. They show coordinates and were prepared for use with an "armillary sphere" - a sphere that consists of a number of rings arranged so as to model the circles of the celestial sphere. Until the Renaissance, these were the most accurate star charts available.

The Polynesians
The Polynesian islanders were among the first people to navigate the oceans, and they used the stars to guide them. The sun marked their day, but very strict records of stars were kept in order to guide them during the night; this practice started before the dawn of the Christian era -- over 2000 years ago. Often, the way they would keep track of stars was by creating mythologies around them, much as the Greeks did. For example, the Pleiades (an open cluster), Jupiter, and Aldebaran (a bright red star), are central to the founding story of the polynesian culture
The Religion of the Parsian
Mir Du'l-feqar Ardestani (ca. 1671-70) in 'School of religious doctrines' speaks of the speaks of the Religion of the Parsian. He states that “The first creation of his existence -bestowing bounty was the precious jewel of the intellectual principle, called Yazad Vohuman; the solar ray which constitutes the excellence of His august existence is from the essence of the light of lights. From the effulgence of Vohuman, or the "First Intelligence," proceeded another, along with the spirit and body of the Pure Ether or Crystalline Sphere. In like manner, from the second Srosh or "angel" there emanated three similar rays; so that every star in the universe, whether in motion or at rest, that is, every planet and fixed star, and also every one of the heavens, has its peculiar intellect and spirit.”
The contribution of the Arabs to the study of the fixed stars
Prof. Paul Kunitzsch in “Arabs and the Stars” states:
“The important role played by the Arabs in transmission and development of the sciences is well known.”
The inhabitants of the Arabian Peninusla, mostly Bedouins, possessed a good knowledge of the sky. A large number of fixed stars and asterisms were known and used for orientation in the desert, and for calendrical purposes such as determnining seasons, agricultural activities and social or religious events. After the spread of Islam, the Arabs became acquainted with the scientific heritage of Greece, India and Persia and by about eighth century A.D. onwards, the Islamic world took part in the transmission and development of sciences.
The most influential source for scientific knowledge of the fixed stars now became the star catalogue in Ptolemy’s Almagest, comprising l025 stars arranged in the 48 classical constellations.
Another important aspect of historical importance is the transmission of Arabic-Islamic science to medieval Europe, through translations into Latin, in twelfth century Spain. Thus their knowledge exerted a fundamental influence on the West.
Technical terms in astronomy such as Zenith, Nadir, and more than 200 star names, appearing at various stages of the scientific development of the West, are enough testimonies to the Arabic influence of that time and they remain alive into our own days.

Abd Al-Rahman Al Sufi (December 7, 903 - May 25, 986) was a Muslim astronomer also known as 'Abd ar-Rahman as-Sufi, or 'Abd al-Rahman Abu al-Husain, and known in the west as Azophi.
He lived in the court of Emire Adud ad-Daula in Isfahan, Persia, and worked on translating and expanding Greek astronomical works, especially the Almagest of Ptolemy. He contributed several corrections to Ptolemy's star list and did his own brightness and magnitude estimates which frequently deviated from those in Ptolemy's work. He was the first to attempt to relate the Greek with the traditional Arabic star names and constellations, which were completely unrelated and overlapped in complicated ways.
He observed that the ecliptic plane is inclined with respect to the celestial equator and more accurately calculated the length of the solar year. He observed and described the stars, their positions, their magnitudes (brightness) and their colour, setting out his results constellation by constellation. For each constellation, he provided two drawings, one from the outside of a celestial globe, and the other from the inside (as seen from the sky). Al Sufi also wrote on the astrolabe, finding numerous additional uses for it.
Al Sufi published his famous "Book of Fixed Stars" in 964, describing much of his work, both in textual descriptions and pictures. Al Sufi was honoured by the Astronomical community when a Moon Crater was named after him. It is Moon Crater Azophi and is at lunar co-ordinates 22.1S, 12.7E and 47 km in diameter

The Arabic Mansions of the Moon, and one version of their alignment with the Zodiac. The fixed stars outside the circles are the traditional marker stars associated with each Mansion, and they often share a name, although the star names have been altered through European adoption (two Mansions do not contain any prominent stars). Because of the linkage with the fixed stars, which change their positions with respect to the Sun’s equinoxes because of precession there has been a greater tendency to treat the Mansions as sidereal than tropical, or to shift the Mansion which is regarded as the first one in accordance with the shift of the Vernal Equinox.
Traditionally in both the Indian and Arabic systems the first Mansion was Al Thurayya (the ‘Many Little Ones’; Indian, Krittika, the ‘General of the Celestial Armies’; Greek, the Pleiades). With the systematisation of Greek astronomy and the fixing of Aries as the first sign of the Zodiac, Sheratan, the horns of Aries, became the first Mansion; it is listed as such by Al Biruni (973-1048 CE) and its equivalent Alnath was treated as the first Mansion by, for instance, Chaucer (1340-1400) and Aggrippa (1486-1535) — Botein seems to have missed out. If the marker stars are used, precessional slippage means that the star Scheat (Beta Pegasi) is currently closest to 0° Aries, and will reach the exact longitude of the Spring Equinox in 2045. The alignment given here is based on a list made by George Yeats, but using the Arabic names from Vivian Robson, TheFixed Stars and Constellations in Astrology(YL1772).

Through time astrology was an acceptable form of knowledge. Plato, Hippocrates, Aristotle, Galileo, Copernicus, and Kepler are all responsible for the elevating of astrology. Their dedicated research, hard work, and celestial observations contributed to the foundation of astrology being regarded as a science.

Galileo Galilei (1564 – 1642)
In a short segment of Galileo's book Sidereus Nuncius, Galileo briefly examined recent observations he had made on the realm of the fixed stars. Through the telescope, Galileo was able to see stars that, before this time, were not even known to exist. These stars, i.e. stars below what Galileo called the sixth magnitude, appeared as bright using the telescope as the second magnitude of stars appeared as seen through natural vision. (Galileo used the term magnitude in describing the brightness of the stars seen without use of any visual aids.) Galileo decided to demonstrate the great number of stars that actually existed by depicting a few star systems that were known to all and including the additional stars that he had observed. He chose to depict the entire constellations of Orion and the Pleiades, but soon decided that Orion was just too large, and so he only sketched the belt and sword region of Orion
Galileo was very interested in these previously "invisible" stars because he felt they were critical to understanding nebulae and the Milky Way. Galileo thought that what had previously been seen as a milky luster in the sky was no more than than these invisible stars. The Milky Way then was just the view of these far distant stars from earth. Nebulae or nebulous stars were in fact actually a number of small stars clustered together. Galileo went on to prove this assertion by sketching out two "nebulae" which were indeed clusters of stars. He depicted the Orion's Head nebula and the nebula of Praesepe (located in the Cancer constellation).
William Lilly(1602-1681)
William Lilly was the most successful and influential astrologer of 17th century England. His career spanned the turbulent years of the English Civil Wars, Cromwell's Protectorate and the Restoration of Charles II. His almanacs and pamphlets had a tangible effect on public opinion, his clients included many of the leading political and military figures of an age when most people naturally believed that the stars and planets had a direct influence on human affairs.
The Elizabethan astrologer, William Lilly, identified about fifty fixed stars in his horary delineations. He says that the Fixed Stars have an influence when in conjunction, opposition, square or parallel aspect with a planet, or significant point in the horoscope. They are particularly important when in the Ascendant or Angles at birth, or when near the Sun or Moon. They also have an effect when directed to the Angles and can be activated by major transits
Dr. W.J. Simmonite and the fixed stars
In his book, “Complete Arcana of Astral Philosophy” Dr. Simmonite has made a mention of 60 eminent fixed stars, with a table, mentioning about their rising, setting and culmination. He has also mentioned the nature and effects of these fixed stars.

Alfred John Pearce and the fixed stars
In chapter XIX captioned “The Fixed Stars” in his “ The Text Book of Astrology ”, Alfred John Pearce states: “The fixed stars are so called because they appear to remain stationary, to keep the same distance from each other, and to have no annual revolution around the Sun. The stars have an apparent motion from east to west, in circles parallel to the equinotical”.
He further states:
• The time of the rising or setting of the fixed star vary according to the latitudes of the place of observation; and the refraction in high latitudes is great.
• The longitudes of the fixed stars increases at the annual rate of 50.25”
• Their latitude vary but very little
• With a fixed star whose latitude does not exceed 8 30’ happens to be in conjunction when the Sun is directed to it’s conjunction, certain effects are distinctly traceable,
• With a fixed star whose latitude does not differ greatly of the Moon or any planet which may happen to be in conjunction with it, certain effects are produced.
• When a fixed star of the first magnitude happens to be exactly culminating or ascending its influence is undersirable.
• Stars having Northern latitude affect us mostly and per contra stars having souther latitudes affect the denizens of the sourthern hemisphere most.
• Aspects of the conjunction, opposition, and zodiacal and mundane parallel should only be considered in regards to the fixed stars.
• Aldabaran, Regulas, Rigel, Arista, Hercules, the North Scale, Formulhaut, Antares, or Orion’s shoulder culminating, give great honour, preferment and good fortune and at the same time, in a lesser degree, when they ascend.
• Varying brightness of the stars: He points out that variable stars exhibit changes in brilliancy. The bright star of Capella is believed to have increased in brightness during the last century. On the other hand one of the seven bright stars of Usra Major has diminished in lusture.
• Irregular or temporary stars: He states that irregular or temporary stars have occasionally shown forth with a lusture for surpassing that the stars of the first magnitude, or even Venus or Jupiter, remaining for a short period and then disapperaring slowly. The most celebrated star of the kind is that bright one in Cassiopaeia, one of the circum-polar constellation, which appeared in 1572 and was observed by the famous astronomer and astrologer, Tycho Brahe. During the early part it surpassed the brightness of Sirius. It was seen at noon by strongsighted people. It was expected to re-appear in 1887, but has not yet been observed. Another great astronomer and astrologer, John Kelper, viewed another star in Ophiuclus in l604, which exceeded the splendour of Jupiter. It remained visible until March 1606.

MAPPING THE SKY IN THE AGE OF EXPLORATION
The age of exploration was well under way and navigator–astronomers turned their attentions to the hitherto uncharted regions of the sky in the southern hemisphere that had been below the horizon for the ancient Greeks. Three names stand out from this era. The first is Petrus Plancius (1552–1622), a Dutch theologian and cartographer; his name is the Latinized form of Pieter Platevoet (literally, Peter Flatfoot). The other two were the Dutch navigators Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser (also known as Petrus Theodorus or Peter Theodore) and Frederick de Houtman. Surprisingly, all three are little-known today despite their lasting contributions.
Plancius instructed Keyser to make observations to fill in the constellation-free zone around the south celestial pole. Keyser was chief pilot on the Hollandia and later on the Mauritius, two of the fleet of four ships that left the Netherlands in 1595 on the first Dutch trading expedition to the East Indies, sailing via Madagascar. Keyser was adept at astronomy and mathematics; the Dutch author A. J. M. Wanders, in his book In the Realm of the Sun and Stars, writes that Keyser observed from the crow’s nest with an instrument given to him by Plancius. Keyser died in September 1596 while the fleet was at Bantam (now Banten, near the modern Serang in western Java). His catalogue of 135 stars, divided into 12 newly invented constellations, was delivered to Plancius when the fleet returned to Holland the following year. Regrettably, little else seems to be known about the life and accomplishments of Keyser, but he left his mark indelibly on the sky.
Keyser’s 12 new constellations first appeared on a globe by Plancius in 1598, and again two years later on a globe by the Dutch cartographer Jodocus Hondius. Their acceptance was assured when Johann Bayer, a German astronomer, included them in his Uranometria of 1603, the leading star atlas of its day. Keyser’s observations were published in tabular form by Johannes Kepler in the Rudolphine Tables of 1627.
The Dutch fleet in which Keyser sailed was commanded by the explorer Cornelis de Houtman; among the crew was his younger brother Frederick de Houtman (1571–1627) who apparently assisted Keyser in his observations. On a second expedition in 1598 Cornelis was killed and Frederick was imprisoned by the Sultan of Atjeh in northern Sumatra. Frederick made good use of his two years in prison by studying the local Malay language and making astronomical observations.
In 1603, following his return to Holland, Frederick de Houtman published his observations as an appendix to a Malayan and Madagascan dictionary that he compiled – one of the most unlikely pieces of astronomical publishing in history. In the Introduction he wrote: ‘Also added are the declinations of many fixed stars around the south pole; never seen before today. Observed and written down by Frederick de Houtman from Gouda.’
De Houtman increased Keyser’s 135 measured star positions to 303, although 107 of these were stars already known to Ptolemy, according to a study of the catalogue by the English astronomer E. B. Knobel. Nowhere did de Houtman give Keyser credit for his priority. De Houtman’s catalogue of southern stars, divided into the same 12 constellations as Keyser’s, was used by the Dutch cartographer Willem Janszoon Blaeu for his celestial globes from 1603 onwards. Keyser and de Houtman are now credited jointly with the invention of these 12 southern constellations, which are still recognized today (see table below).

Twelve constellations introduced 1596–1603 by Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman
Apus Chamaeleon Dorado
Grus Hydrus Indus
Musca Pavo Phoenix
Triangulum Australe Tucana Volans
As the accuracy of astronomical observations improved and fainter stars were charted, the opportunities grew for innovators to introduce new constellations even among the area of sky known to the ancient Greeks. In addition to recording the southern constellations of Keyser and de Houtman, Petrus Plancius invented some constellations of his own, among them Columba, the dove, which he formed from nine stars that Ptolemy had listed as surrounding Canis Major; he also invented the unlikely sounding Monoceros, the unicorn, and Camelopardalis, the giraffe, from faint stars uncharted by Ptolemy. These three Plancius constellations are still accepted by astronomers, but his other inventions fell by the wayside.
Eleven more constellations were introduced later in the 17th century by the Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius (1611–87), filling the remaining gaps in the northern sky. They were illustrated in his star atlas called Firmamentum Sobiescianum, published posthumously in 1690. Oddly enough, Hevelius insisted on observing with the naked eye even though telescopes were by then available; many of his constellations were deliberately faint as though he was boasting of the power of his eyesight. Of Hevelius’s inventions, seven are still accepted by astronomers (see table below). The rejected four were Cerberus, Mons Maenalus, Musca and Triangulum Minor.
Seven constellations introduced by Johannes Hevelius on his star map published posthumously in 1690
Canes Venatici Lacerta Leo Minor Lynx
Scutum Sextans Vulpecula
Although the northern constellations were now complete, there were still gaps in the southern sky. These were filled by the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille (171362) who sailed to South Africa in 1750 and set up a small observatory at Cape Town under the famous Table Mountain, which impressed him so much that he later named a constellation after it, Mensa. At the Cape from August 1751 to July 1752 Lacaille observed the positions of nearly 10,000 stars, an astounding total in the short time.
On his return to France in 1754, Lacaille presented a map of the southern skies to the French Royal Academy of Sciences, including 14 new constellations of his own invention (see table below). The map was published in 1756, and Lacaille’s new constellations were rapidly accepted by other astronomers.



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY

Whereas Keyser and de Houtman had mostly named their constellations after exotic animals, Lacaille commemorated instruments of science and art, with the exception of Mensa, named after the Table Mountain under which he had carried out his observations. His full catalogue, and a revised map, was published under the title Coelum Australe Stelliferum in 1763. In this catalogue, Lacaille divided up the unwieldy constellation Argo Navis, the ship, into the subsections Carina, Puppis and Vela that astronomers still use as separate constellations. As well as creating 14 new constellations, Lacaille eliminated a preexisting one – Robur Carolinum, Charles’s Oak, introduced by the Englishman Edmond Halley in 1678 to honour King Charles II.
Fourteen constellations introduced by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1754
Antlia Caelum Circinus
Fornax Horologium Mensa
Microscopium Norma Octans
Pictor Pyxis Reticulum
Sculptor Telescopium
All those from Lacaille’s time onwards who gerrymandered with the constellations did so without lasting success, but there were plenty of astronomers who tried to leave their mark on the sky. Constellation mania had reached its height by 1801 when the German astronomer Johann Elert Bode (1747–1826) published his immense star atlas, Uranographia, containing over 100 different constellations; but by then astronomers realized that things had gone too far, and during the ensuing century this number was eroded by a process of natural wastage. In 1899 the American historian R. H. Allen summed up the prevailing situation in his book Star Names and Their Meaning: ‘From 80 to 90 constellations may be considered as now more or less acknowledged’.
One serious deficiency was that there were still no generally agreed boundaries to the constellations. Since Bode’s time cartographers had drawn dotted lines snaking between constellation figures, but these were arbitrary lines of demarcation that varied from atlas to atlas. The matter was settled once and for all by astronomy’s governing body, the International Astronomical Union (IAU).At its first General Assembly in 1922, the IAU officially adopted the list of 88 constellations, covering the entire sky, that we use today. On behalf of the IAU a Belgian astronomer, Eugène Delporte (1882–1955), then drew up a definitive list of boundaries for these 88 constellations.

Edmond Halley, 1656 - 1742
Edmond Halley is known by most people nowadays for the periodic comet named after him, although he had a wide range of scientific interests and held posts varying from sea captain to Astronomer Royal. His contribution to astronomy was considerable, but he was largely overshadowed by his contemporary, Sir Isaac Newton.
There is some doubt as to Halley's exact date of birth. Some sources give it as 08 November 1656, but Halley's own account gives it as 29 October 1656. As there was no baptism certificate in his local parish near Shoreditch, the exact date has never been satisfactorily determined. Whatever the exact date, Halley was born into a financially secure home at Haggerston, just outside London. He went to school at Saint Pauls, and then went on to Queen's College, Oxford where his interest in astronomy grew. At the age of 20 and only halfway through his university degree, and influenced by John Flamsteed's Star Catalogue of the Northern Skies, Halley decided to catalogue stars in the southern hemisphere. Halley and a friend set off in November 1676 to sail to St. Helena (an island in the South Atlantic) with free passage granted by the King with the East India Company. During Halley's stay in St Helena, he observed a transit of Mercury on 07 November 1677 and catalogued the positions of some 360 stars. On returning to England in 1679 he had his observations published as the Catalogus Stellarum Australium, which contained detailed positions of 341 stars. The Catalogus received wide acclaim. Not only was it the first catalogue of the southern hemisphere stars but also the first mapping of stars compiled using a telescope. It established Halley's scientific reputation, prompted Cambridge University to award him an honorary degree, and the Royal Society to elect him a Fellow
During 1718 Halley observed Sirius, Aldebaran and Arcturus and compared their positions in the sky with Ptolomey's Star Atlas; noticing that the positions did not agree Halley thus discovered the phenomenon of stellar proper motion
Friedrich Bessel, 1784 - 1846
Friedrich Bessel was born on 22 July 1784, in Prussia. He started working life as an accountant. His knowledge of astronomy was entirely self-taught. Amongst his admirers was King Frederick William III of Prussia, who offered him a position in which he was in control of construction of a new observatory at Konigsberg. Soon after the new observatory became operational, Bessel began to make accurate positional measurements of stars for inclusion in a new star catalogue. The completed catalogue was an extension and revision of an early one compiled by James Bradley. On completion in 1818, Bessel had recorded some 63,000 accurate star positions. His measurements were precise enough to reveal irregularities in the proper motions of Sirius and Procyon, from which he surmised that they must each have an object in orbit around them. This surmise proved correct and in the second half of the nineteenth century, the companion stars were discovered by Clark in 1862 and Schaeberle in 1892 respectively. Bessel is best known today for being the first astronomer to determine a star's distance from parallax measurements. He chose a star that had a large proper motion and and hence was likely to be relatively close to Earth. He reported his results in 1838, quoting a parallax of 0.31 arcsec for the star 61 Cygnii. (The modern, accepted value is 0.3 arcsec.) However Bessel was not alone in measuring stellar parallax: Struve and Henderson were also attempting measurements, independently of each other.

Friedrich Struve, 1793 - 1864
Friedrich Struve was born on 05 April 1793, in Altona, Germany. In 1808, at the age of 15, Struve was forced to decide whether to stay in Germany and risk being conscripted into Napoleon's army, which was then in occupation, or to flee the country. Once in Russia, Struve enrolled at the University of Dorpat (now known so Tartu). In 1815 he became the director of the Dorpat Observatory. This observatory was very well equipped for the period. In 1824, a ten-inch refractor made by Fraunhofer was installed at Dorpat. It was equatorially mounted and driven by one of the first clock-drives ever used. When the Fraunhofer telescope was installed, Struve commenced the research for which he became famous, the study of double stars.
Struve started a complete survey of the sky, as far south as -15° declination. At the end of his survey he had catalogued about 120,000 stars including some 2200 doubles. He published the catalogue in 1827. During the years 1825-1827, Struve constructed a travelling wire micrometer. He then used this instrument to measure accurately the positions of the various components of the double and multiple stars which he discovered. After publication of his first catalogue, Struve wrote two books on double and multiple stars, published in 1837 and 1852. The 1837 book included additional double and multiple stars, increasing the total to 3112.
Between 1834 and 1837 Struve determined the parallax of Vega, arriving at a parallax angle of 0.26 arcsec. (The modern value is under half this, 0.12 arcsec.) Bessel is usually credited with determination of the first stellar parallax, of 61 Cygni in 1837; in fact it is probable that Struve preceded this date by a year or so. However, Besell's results gained a quicker acceptance by the astronomical community than did Struve's.
After holding the post of Director of the Dorpat Observatory for 24 years, Tsar Nicholas I of Russia invited Struve to take over the directorship of a new observatory at Pulkovo. The observatory was situated about ten miles south of St. Petersburg (now known as Leningrad), being built and equipped to Struve's own specifications. Struve worked at Pulkovo Observatory for over 20 years, concentrating on more double star studies. Struve's son, Otto, assisted with the observations. In 1861, Struve retired from the Directorship of Pulkovo and was succeeded by Otto.
Edward Barnard, 1851 - 1923
Edward Barnard was born in Nashville, Tennessee on 16 December 1851. He received only a mediocre education, following which he became interested in photography, and for a few years made it his profession. From an early age Barnard was interested in astronomy, being a serious sky observer in his leisure time.
After completing his University course, Barnard was offered, and accepted, the post of assistant astronomer at the new Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton, California. While at Lick Observatory he made three important discoveries in 1892:
• During 1892 there was a nova in Auriga. After studying the nova for some months Barnard noticed that a patch of gaseous matter had appeared round the star. This was the first conclusive evidence that a nova was an exploding star.

• Barnard's second discovery of 1892 was the fifth satellite of Jupiter.
• Barnard's third discovery of 1892 has remained in relative obscurity: during the 1892-93 period he noted craters and mountains on Mars. At the time he kept quiet about these observations, fearing that he would be disbelieved. Barnard's Mars observations were made known widely only as recently as 1966.
During 1883, Vanderbilt University awarded Barnard a fellowship in astronomy. After only a short period at Vanderbilt, Barnard was given charge of the University Observatory. Later in the year, whilst observing an occultation of Beta Capricorni he noticed that the star flickered prior to disappearance instead of disappearing instantly. As a result of this observation, Barnard proposed that the star could be a binary.
In 1895 Barnard moved, and began working at the Yerkes Observatory where he had the use of the 40 inch refractor. This move necessitated him taking up the post of Professor of Astronomy at Chicago University. At Yerkes, Barnard continued his program of photographing the Milky Way. Along with Wolf, he was one of the first to realize that the dark patches in the Milky Way were in fact clouds of gas and dust that obscured the stars behind. In 1917, the Carnegie Institute in Washington published a photographic atlas of selected Milky Way regions based on Barnard's photographs.
During 1916 Barnard discovered a star that had a very fast proper motion in Ophiuchus. This star moves about 1/2° in a period of only 18 years. This object has become generally known as Barnard's Star, holding the record for the greatest proper motion of any known star.
Ejnar Hertzsprung, 1873 - 1967 and Henry Russell, 1877 - 1957
Ejnar Hertzsprung was born on 08 October 1873 and Henry Russell was born on 25 October 1877. Both men independently discovered the relationship between the absolute magnitude and the colour of stars. The result was the Hertzsprung-Russell, or H-R diagram. The H-R diagram, in both its original and modern forms, has greatly assisted astronomers to understand the evolution of stars.
Hertzsprung was educated as a chemical engineer, working for two years in St. Petersburg until 1901. During 1902 he returned to his native Copenhagen with a great interest in astronomy. After some seven years he was appointed as an astrophysical lecturer at Gottingen. Hertzsprung was one of the first to advance the idea of absolute magnitude. (The absolute magnitude of a star is the magnitude that it would have if it were situated at a standard distance from the Earth, this distance being 10 parsecs or 32.6 light-years. This enables stars of differing luminosities to be directly compared.)
Hertzsprung specialized in stellar photography, particularly of double stars and estimates of stellar magnitude from photographs. This led to him publish in a semi-popular manner, in a photographic journal, his ideas about stellar colour and absolute magnitude. The article went unnoticed for nearly ten years.
During 1911 Hertzsprung discovered that the Pole Star was a Cepheid variable, varying by 0.2 magnitude in a period of about four days.

Hertzsprung became a professor at Leiden in Holland in 1935, and upon his retirement, he returned to his native Denmark, dying on 21 October 1967.
Russell was educated at Princeton University, New Jersey, receiving his doctorate in 1900. He worked for a short time in England before returning to teach at Princeton. Russell's research led him to the discovery of the luminosity-colour-spectral class relationships of stars. Russell presented his results at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in December 1913. He published his work in 1914, some nine years after Hertzsprung.
Edward Barnard, 1851 - 1923

Vivian Robson and the fixed stars
In “The Fixed Stars and Constellations in Astrology” Vivian E. Robson states: “Of late the subject of fixed stars and constellations has aroused the interest and curiosity of the astrological student who has been debarred from examining their effects owing to the lack of available information.
He has compiled the information in a systematic manner so that it could be complete and also a foundation upon which future research may be built. In the process he has borrowed heavily on Alvidas, R.H. Allen, Ptolemy, Wilson, Simmonite, Pearce and Bullingel.
He says that the fixed stars were changing their positions owing to precession. Until recently the fixed stars were found to be moving through space in immense and unknown orbits. Each fixed star is similar to our Sun in structure and general composition, differing only in size and temperature. It shines by its own light and is probably surrounded by its own system of planets. The distance of fixed stars is measured in light years and the nearest to us being Bungula is at a distance of 4.3 light years.
Motion of the fixed stars:
There are 3 distinct kinds of motion.
a) Precisional motion due to the precision of the equinox where all stars appear to advance their longitude at the rate of 50” per annum due to the retrograde motion of the Vernal Equinox.
b) Proper Motion: In 1718 Halley discovered that Arcturus and Sirus had moved southward since the time of Ptolemy and it is now recognized that all stars possess a motion of their own that causes them gradually to change their positions relative to each other. As seen from the earth the average proper motion of a first magnitude star is about 0.25’’ per annum while that of a sixth magnitude stars about 0.04’’. In common with the other stars, our Sun is moving through space, we are told that the real cause is the precision, it is probable that the orbit is one necessitating about 26000 years for a complete circuit. The direction in which the Sun and the whole Solar System is moving, the Apex of the Sun’s way, lies on the border of Hercules is R.A. 277 5’ and declination 35 N which corresponds to Capricorn 11 and Lat. 58 N.

c) Radial Motion: This is only another form of proper motion found in the approaching or receding body which has been use to measure its velocity.
d) Binary and multiple stars: Stars which appear to be single to the naked eye are in fact two or more under the examination of the telescope, lying very close together. In the same way we may have triple or quadruple stars grouped together.
e) Clusters : When a great number of stars appear together we have a cluster like Pleides. The Milky Way also forms an enormous cluster right across the heaven.
f) Nebulae : Many clusters were known as nebulous stars. However, today, a many great real nebulae are known, considered of incandescent gaseous matter extending over many millions of miles of space and gradually condesncing to form a star or a solar system.
g) Colour and Magnitude : The fixed stars exhibit a great variety of colours. The apparent sizes are linked by numbers representing magnitude. First magnitude stars comprise the brightest in the heavens such as Sirus, Arcturus and Alderbaren. Certain stars appear to change their brightness and vary periodically between certain magnitudes, Algol varies between magnitudes 2.3 and 3.5 during a total period of approximately 3 days whilest Mira varies between 9th and 2nd magnitude over a period of 11 months. Certain other stars show a gradual change of magnitude and others blaze temporarilyand then diminish inlight rapaidly or disappear altogether.
h) Classification : Throughout the ages different methods have been used to classify the stars, but almost all are based upon the fundamental groupings into constellations. In 270 B.C. Aratos mentions 45 of them, Ptolemy recognized 48 constellations. Since l600 the remaining have been added. Robson mentions 108 constellations and 110 fixed stars.
The beginning of the 20th Century brought a revitalization of astrology. Dr. Alan Leo emphasized human nature in his work and showed how we can or can’t control our destiny in life. He is responsible for removing the fortune telling myth surrounding astrology and elevated it to a new ethical status. American astrologers such as Llewellyn George, Carl Payne Tobey, Dr. Marc Edmund Jones, and Dane Rudhyar all made fantastic contributions and have modernized the subject over the years. Such events are worth mentioning over here because interpretation of fixed stars is a part and parcel of astrogy.
Ebertin-Hoffman – Fixed Stars and their Interpretations
The great German astrologer, Reinhold Ebertin(1887-1974), refined and reworked the Hamburg School approach, and developed a radically new astrological theory. He termed his method cosmobiology, in an attempt to distance it from astrological dogma that he found less than satisfactory. Ebertin's masterwork, the Combination of Stellar Influences, set a new standard for interpreting planetary aspects.
Reinhold Ebertin and his team consisting of George Hoffman, Elisveth Ebertin, Dr. Walter Koch, R. Schumacher, Erich Von Beckerath, and Dr. Gustav Schwickert have interpreted 73 fixed stars with celebrated cases. The table “Latitudinal position of the fixed stars” shows the position of each fixed star in its zodiacal sign, its brightness and magnitude

Fixed Stars - Diana K Rosenburg
Robert Hand has called Diana "the world's foremost authority on Fixed Stars". She is the author of the New Fixed Star Workbook and has co-authored Asteroid Names and Nodes and Ephemeris of the Asteroid Diana. Her chapter on Fixed Stars and the Hindu Lunar Mansions appears in Richard Houck's Hindu Astrology Lessons.
The following extract from her writing gives a comprehensive pricture of the sky from times immemorial:
“ The night sky, with its eternal fixed stars and majestic constellations, is the ancient root of all astrology and the deepest source of the creation myths of mankind. Long before there were horoscopes, aspects, houses or signs, dedicated priest-astrologers of Sumer, Akkad, Babylon, Greece, Phoenicia, Egypt, China, India, Central America, indeed, of virtually every civilization of which we have record, patiently observed and measured sky-patterns. The mysterious risings, settings, and circlings of heaven were weighed against mundane phenomena of earth, sea and humankind; learned astrologers compared, synthesized, and integrated all they knew of earth and sky, that mankind might comprehend its part in the great mystery. Their greatest responsibility lay in recording and handing down all they had learned so that we, their heirs, could carry forward the sacred task.
Now, at the end of the 20th century of the Common Era - more than 5,000 years after the earliest scribes of Sumer first recorded already ancient wisdom passed down to them by memory-chanters - the recovery and translation of ancient texts have made it possible to rediscover, analyze, test and employ this great heritage of star-knowledge. What was once known only to the most learned priests of the earliest civilizations has come into our hands, that we may now take our place in the sacred succession. “
Anne Wright and the fixed stars:
A lot of effort has gone into providing the maximum information on Fixed Stars on the web. One can discover the traditional astrological influences of 290 fixed stars and 88 constellations. There are 6500 specific influences categorized under 40 subject titles. The 28 nakshatras used in Indian astrology have also been incorporated in this beautiful site.

stars in natal and mundane astrology. There is a blend of modern techniques with Egyptian and Greek procedures and mythology.
Dr Gonzalo Pena Tamez
Inn his article on “Zodical positions of the fixed stars” Dr. Gonzalo writes as follows:
“It was early in my astrological studies that transit watching, and natal observations too, taught me to trust as an evident truth that indeed the actual ecliptic longitudes of the fixed stars, even if they be extra zodiacal stars, are "alive" in the astrological sense, fulfilling at least in a symbolic fashion some of the correlates that traditional lore ascribe to them; and that these ecliptic longitudes definitely respond to dynamic planetary aspects in natal and in mundane charts as well, etc.
Of course, while it is true that my observational experience assures me that though the ecliptic longitude coordinates of fixed stars are very removed from the ecliptic, and from the zodiac, they are definitely "alive" in the astrological sense, I nonetheless grant the validity of the general principle stating that the closer the star is to the ecliptic the "more alive" its ecliptic longitude will appear to be, other things being equal.
"Other things being equal" may include some diverse additional factors, like the real or apparent magnitudes or luminosities; the intrinsic nature of the star, etc. Some very influential stars are actually quite away from the ecliptic. Polaris is such an extreme case, and yet, I very well know from experience that Polaris IS a very influential star in the chart. I have found it to be true that Polaris tends to confer extreme "goal oriented" attitude in the natal chart. Some big zodiacal stars are very influential but yet not as much as some small extra zodiacal stars that are even more potent, like Algol (Beta Perseus), which has declination is + 40:46.
The fact that the ecliptic longitudes of fixed stars that are very removed from the ecliptic are astrologically "alive" is, I think, one of several independent indicators that there is a great deal more to the ecliptic, as a modulus, than we actually tend to grant, or even imagine. In my Lessons for the "I Am an Astrology Student", I have structured some basic axioms of the astrological system, and the 3rd axiom is called the Axiom of Ecliptic Modularity, stating that of all the possible muduli where we could conceivably measure the longitude coordinate for the purpose of referencing a specific direction in the heavenly vault, none is better than the ecliptic. And what does it mean for a modulus to be better than another?. That's the key question. The answer is that the better the modulus, the more you can make do, for astrological purposes, with only one of the two necessary coordinates to specify a point in the celestial sphere.
To grasp better the idea, think that as a corollary of this 3rd axiom, it follows, for example, that if instead of referencing the positions of the planets on the great circular modulus of the ecliptic in degrees and minutes of longitude from the fiducial say at the Spring Equinox, we instead carried this referencing on the great circular modulus of the celestial equator (like astronomers do) in degrees of Right Ascension from the same fiducial at the Spring Equinox (which is where these two great celestial circles, the ecliptic and the Equator, intersect, besides of at its opposite point at zero Libra of course), then we would need to rely a lot

more on declination, for completeness sake, than we actually rely on ecliptic Latitude when we use the ecliptic instead of the Equator.
Instead of referencing the positions of the fixed stars on the ecliptic modulus, or on the equatorial modulus, we referenced them onto another, arbitrary great circle, maybe not too far from either of these two ones so as to not get too far off anyway from where the planetary action is at in heavens, then we would have to rely a great deal more on the second coordinate, the "y". On the ecliptic, the "x" is longitude of course, and the "y" is Latitude. On the Equator the "x" is Right Ascension and the "y" is declination, in both cases from the same fiducial at the tropical zero Aries. Now imagine this 3rd circle, also passing through the Equinoctial axis for the sake of not introducing further variables, ok?. But this 3rd circle is arbitrary, although its center is also the center of the earth like for the ecliptic and the equatorial great circles. In this 3rd circle we are going to reference the positions of the planets now, instead of in the ecliptic as we usually do.
The "x" now in this 3rd circle will be measured also in degrees from the same fiducial as in the other two great circles of heavens, the one astrologers use (ecliptic) and the one astronomers use (equator), namely the zero Aries. And the "y" will be measured along the perpendicular just like the Latitude in the ecliptic modulus or the Declination in the equatorial modulus. If my contention is correct, then what I am saying is that because the ecliptic has greater true astrological modularity, latitude is less important than if we did the measuring on the equator, where declination becomes more necessary than Latitude was in the ecliptic modulus; and even much more important will be the "y" measurement if we were instead using the imaginary and arbitrary 3rd great circular modulus I described.
Because the ecliptic is really the best astrological modulus possible, when we measure upon it, one single coordinate, namely ecliptic longitude, can actually do marvels. That's the corollary of the axiom of ecliptic modularity.
In another explanatory plane, we can adduce that this is so because the ecliptic plane is the only plane that goes through the gravitatory center of the Sun and of the Earth, and that additionally the planets are never too far off from this ecliptic plane, and the planetary plane is so important because it "stirs" dynamically the more astrologically archetypal light that comes to us from the stars and the directions to other deep space objects.
The ecliptic is a great deal more than an arbitrary modulue, and thus its properties are way beyond the properties of an arbitrary referential modulue’s for quantifying a positional coordinate. We better accept that truth. That's why we can do marvels with only longitude.”

THE BIBLICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE HEAVENS AND THE STARS The Heavens declare His handywork: as depicted from the Bible
Robert R. Jones II of the Horizon Energy Corporation gives us the following interpretations of the heavens, constellations and stars, with a beautiful illustration of the constellation Orion. As the thesis aims to be comprehensive, it is felt necessary that the biblical point of view should also be put forth.
"Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and years, and let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth." (Gen 1:14-15).
The stars of heaven and their constellations will not show their light. (Isaiah 13:10).
Can you bind the beautiful Pleiades? Can you loose the cords of Orion? Can you bring forth the constellations in their seasons or lead out the Bear with its cubs? Do you know the laws of the heavens? (Job 38:31-32)
In ancient times, signs were used as a witness of a special covenant either between God and mankind or between different peoples on the earth. In Genesis 9:12-13, God put a special sign in the sky.
And God said; “This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come: I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth”.
Observing the Sabbath was a sign of the covenant relationship between Israel and God (Exodus 31:16-17). On several occasions, a stone was a sign or witness of a promise (see Joshua 24:25-27; 1 Samuel 7:12).
The constellations are also referred to as signs. (See Gen. 1:14-15, above.) They are somewhat abstract in form. In other words, they don't look exactly like what they represent. For example, the rainbow after a rain is a sign that God promises to not destroy the world again by water. In like manner, the constellations bring to mind God's wonderful promises concerning the Messiah, His redeeming work, and his Bride, the Church.
The Ancient Constellations
The ancient constellations (48 in all) are picture prophecies of Jesus, the Word or Logos, and are in harmony with the written Word of God. In fact, many individual star names are recorded in the Bible as appellations or attributes of Jesus. Just to get us started, here are a few: Arm of the Lord, Isa. 51:9,10; Chief Shepherd, 1 Pet. 5:4; Desired of all nations, Hag. 2:7; Governor, Matt. 2:6; Great shepherd of the sheep, Heb. 13:20, 27:24; King, Matt. 21:5; Lamb, Rev. 5:6,8; 6:16; 7:9,10,17; Light, John 8:12; Lion of the tribe of Judah, Rev. 5:5; Prince, Acts 5:31; Redeemer, Isa. 59:20; Scepter, Num. 24:17; Shepherd, Mark 14:27. These names are components of larger pictures or constellations which tell a story.

The Meaning Of The Constellations
There are 12 major constellations. Their modern names, which tell us nothing of their original meanings, are in parenthesis. Each major constellation has three other constellations associated with it which modify or complete its meaning. They are called decans. The Incarnate Son (Virgo) Isaiah 7:14 The Redeemer (Libra) 1 Cor. 6:20 The Sufferer (Scorpio) 1 Cor. 15:55-56 The Conqueror (Sagittarius) Rev. 6:2 The Sacrifice (Capricornus) Romans 3:25 The Living Water (Aquarius) John 7:38 The Liberator (Pisces) Gen. 48:19; Mark 1:17 The Crowned Lamb (Aries) Rev. 5:6 The Judge (Taurus) John 5:22 The King (Gemini) Romans 1:3 The Protector (Cancer) Isaiah 4:5-6 The Victor (Leo) Rev. 5:5
As mentioned previously, the names of the stars themselves give definition to each of the constellations. These names are preserved from the most ancient of times. In world history, we find the major signs of the constellations are the same in the meaning of their names and their procession in the major civilizations of the world. These 12 major constellations (or Mazzaroth, Job 38:32 KJ) mark a continuous circle (ecliptic) or line around the earth which today is called Zodiac, from the Greek word zoad and meaning The Way or A Path (John 14:6; Psalm 119:105).

Robert R. Jones has chosen to illustrate Orion, Taurus and Eridanus. Orion is well known and can be identified by most people. It is visible in North America from October through March and dominates the evening sky with its brilliance. Since Orion and Eridanus are decans of Taurus and work as a group, we will look at all three.
The illustration below depicts Orion as a mighty man with a club in his raised right hand and the skin of a slain lion in his left hand. His left foot is crushing the enemy. He wears a girdle around his waist from which hangs a sword. In the oldest illustrations of Orion, the hilt and handle of the sword are drawn as the head and body of a lamb. From his raised foot flows a river (of fire).

Orion means The Coming Light (John 8:12; John 1:4-5; Isaiah 9:2). The brilliant star in his right shoulder is Betelgeuse and means The Coming Branch (Isaiah 11:1; Jer. 23:5). The star in his left shoulder is Bellatrix and means swiftly coming or suddenly destroying (Rev. 22:7). Rigel, the star in his raised foot means the foot that crusheth (Psalm 91:13-15; Romans. 16:20). A star in his belt means The Wounded One (Isaiah 53:5). Saiph, in his leg, means Bruised (Isaiah 53:5).
Taurus, The Judge
Taurus is not just a bull, it is the wild ox of long ago, a fierce, mighty and untamable creature (Job 39:9-10). With horns lowered, he is in the act of charging the enemy. Taurus portrays the power and glory of Christ coming as The Judge (Deut. 33:17; John 5:2627).The bright, reddish star in the bull's eye is Aldeberan and means The Governor (Psalm 22:28), Captain, or Leader. The bright star at the tip of the left horn is Elnath, The Wounded. Riding on the shoulder of the wild ox is the beautiful Pleiades, a circlet of stars meaning Congregation of the Judge (1 Cor. 6:1-3).

Eridanus, River of The Judge
Issuing from the foot of Orion, is a river of Judgment. This is an immense constellation. Star names include the after part of the river, flowing, and bent down. It has always been associated with fire (Daniel 7:10).
Putting It All Together
Look at the three constellations together and compare it to the following scripture:
His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise. And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power. Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet. He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting (Hab. 3:3-6).

USE OF THE FIXED STARS IN CHART INTERPRETATION
Fixed stars are additional components. A Fixed Star report makes an excellent addition to your natal chart, containing great information about the individual. Except for focusing on the stars on the angles and cusps, precise moment of birth is not necessary.
According to Bernadette Brady, the first step is to determine whih ones are forming paran relationships to the natal chart.
Then sort out the rising stars, culminating stars, setting stars and stars on the Nadir. The Egyptians worked with stars observing their rising, culminating and settings. They also noted the phases of the stars. They considered that a period of time was ruled by a certain star and that its rising and setting had symbolic meaning. This Fixed Star report reflects this Egyptian approach.
They deal with the four periods of life’s division. The first three being those effective during a person’s life and the last being the summation of the life work, as under:
Rising – first 25 years (early life). Culminating – the period from late twenties till about sixty (middle years). Setting – Years after the early sixties.
The importance of fixed stars are stated to give the greatest importance on the angles. But what about the fixed stars on other cusps and houses. Do they not give positive result and enhance the reputation and rise of the native. Are there not other indications to judge their results? Whether the above method will fit in all cases is really to be seen.
It is true that fixed stars have a permanent marking on the characteristics and actions of a native. In the case of the Nightingale of India, Lata Mangeskar, her lord of Ascendant, Mercury, is on the fixed star Spica, in the fifth house. She got fame and honour quite early in life. (see chart ). Further, it is interesting to note that in Chart No. , the native got fame only after the age of 48. In his chart Jupiter is on the Ascendant (Leo) on Regulas. Taking the above two current examples into consideration, it could also be concluded that effects could also be calculated according to the planetary ages of men (by Saphariel) coinciding with simultaneous transits of the planets, which are stated below:
Planets Age (period)
Moon 0 to 7
Mercury 7 to 15
Venus 15 to 24
Sun 24 to 34
Mars 34 to 45
Jupiter 45 to 57
Saturn 57 to 70
Uranus 70 to 84
Neptune 84 to 99
Pluto 99 to 115

Effects: When a fixed star conjuncts a natal planet, there is a permanent blending of the influences of the star on that planet. When an arc, progression or transit, activates this conjunction; it will reveal the symbolism of that star.
Aspects: The fixed stars operate by position and are said to "cast no rays" or, in other words, their aspects are said to be ineffective and their influence is to be exerted only by conjunction and parallel. Some authorities suggest aspects to the fixed stars can be read, but it is only the opposition that is thought to be of any relevance. The opposition may exert some influence due to the polarity, but the conjunction is by far the primary aspect to consider. Trines, sextiles and squares should therefore be discounted. The fixed stars are only to be read to the natal and not to progressed or arc charts. Fixed stars are irrelevant to the study of midpoints.
Magnitude System: Magnitude is the measurement of the brightness of a star. The higher the number, the dimmer the star. The dimmest stars visible to the naked eye are about 6th magnitude. An arc minute is 1/60 of a degree. An arc second of an arc minute or 1/3600 of a degree “visual magnitude” is a scale used by astronomers to measure the brightness of a star. The term “visual” means the brightness is being measured in the visible part of the spectrum, the part seen with the naked eye (usually about 5500 angstrons). Angstrom is know as Electromagnetic radiation that traves in waves. Scientists use the length of the waves (the distance between peaks) to define the energy of the radiation, Astronomers measure this length in “angstroms,” a unit of measure equal to one hundred-millionth of a centimeter. It is a convenient shorthand to avoid writing lots of zeros when talking about the wavelengths of light. In everyday terms, a sheet of paper is approximately 1,000,000 angstroms thick. Visible light covers the range from 4,000 to 8,000 angstrom.
The first known catalogue of stars was made by the Greek Astronomer Hipparchus in about 120 B.C. and contained 108 stars. It was later edited and increased to 1022 stars by Ptolemy in a famous catalogue known as the "Almagest". Hipparchus listed the stars that could be seen in each constellation, described their positions, and rated their brightness on a scale of 1 to 6, the brightest being 1. This method of describing the brightness of a star survives today. Of course, Hipparchus had no telescope, and so could only see stars as dim as 6th magnitude, but today we can see stars with ground-based telescopes down to about 22nd magnitude.
When astronomers began to accurately measure the brightness of stars using instruments, it was found that each magnitude is about 2.5 times brighter than the next greater magnitude. This means a difference in magnitudes of 5 units (from magnitude 1 to magnitude 6, for example) corresponds to a change in brightness of 100 times. With equipment to make more accurate measurements, astronomers were able to assign stars decimal values, like 2.75, rather than rounding off to magnitude 2 or 3.
There are stars brighter than magnitude 1. The star Vega (alpha Lyrae) has a visual magnitude of 0. There are a few stars brighter than Vega. Their magnitudes will be negative.

Astronomers usually refer to "apparent magnitudes", that is, how bright a star appears to us here at Earth. Apparent magnitudes are often written with a lower case "m" (like 3.24m).
The brightness of a star depends not only on how bright it actually is, but also on how far away it is. For example, a street light appears very bright directly underneath it, but not as bright if it's 1/2 a mile away down the road. Therefore, astronomers developed the "absolute" brightness scale. Absolute magnitude is defined as how bright a star would appear if it were exactly 10 parsecs (about 33 light years) away from Earth. For example, the Sun has an apparent magnitude of -26.7 (because it's very, very close).
This is a method of expressing the apparent brightness of a celestial object. The magnitude system is confusing to many people, since the magnitude number grows larger as the star grows fainter. The confusion will disappear immediately if the word 'class' is substituted for 'magnitude'. Obviously we would expect a 'first class star' to be brighter than a second or third class star and the term '4th class' already begin to suggest faintness and unimportance.

Note: The last 2 of these 21 "first magnitude" stars are really closer to second magnitude.They are included because they lie in the Zodiac. Zodiacal stars lie in a band extending 8° to either side of the plane of the ecliptic which traces a kind of sine-wave against the stellar background.
The 16° band of the zodiac on either side of the sunpath the plane of the ecliptic traces through the sky marks a sort of stellar horizon of what stars can be viewed all places on earth north or south. Undoubtedly this is the reason that some constellations in the Zodiac including many rather arbitrarily composed of faint stars - have been given importance by ancient astronomers from all cultures.
Latitude from the ecliptic: With the exception of the zodiacal constellations and a few other constellation near the ecliptic, or parts of constellations that stretch into the ecliptic path, like Ophiuchus and Cetus, most fixed stars are positioned outside the ecliptic and many have large latitude from the Ecliptic and declinations from the Celestial Equator, such as;Polaris the Pole Star, stars in the constellations Argo, Crux, Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, Draco, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, Perseus and its star Algol, etc have very large latitudes. Some astrologers offer the opinion that fixed stars with large latitudes or more than 17 degrees latitude from the ecliptic (Pluto's orbit) are of no use in practical interpretation. However, Ebertin in Fixed Stars by Ebertin-Hoffman, says that practice does not bear out this opinion. Moreover, he says; "practice shows that a star's high latitude does not appear to matter at all".

Spectral Class: George Noonan offers the following concepts to our understanding of spectral class. "The natures of the stars were assigned by classicists on the basis of their color; red to Mars and Saturn, white to Venus, blue to Jupiter and the Moon, yellow to Mercury and the Sun. It is not surprising therefore to find a strong correlation of the ancient natures of the fixed stars with their modern stellar spectra. In this regard the stars can be classified according to their spectra in a very natural way from the most benefic to the most malefic."
He gives the tables below for spectral class:
0 Moon B Jupiter A Venus F Mercury G Sun K Mars M Saturn
"Class 0 stars are those whose spectra is very strong in the ultraviolet lines of nitrogen and life giving oxygen. Stars in this class would have the nature of the most benefic planet of all - the Moon.
Class B stars is strong in helium, but also with nitrogen and oxygen. They are astrologically as Jupiter.
Class A stars are those in which the element hydrogen is prominent. They are as Venus.
Mercury is neutral as to a benefic or malefic nature, stars with a spectral class F can also be classified as neutral in that this class contains minor metals such as calcium and is a bridge to the more metallic stars. So stars in spectral class F are as Mercury.
Our Sun is a spectral class G star.
Metallic lines, especially iron, dominate the spectra of class K stars.
Class K is therefore of Mars.
"Finally those stars in spectral class M, with its lines of harsh metals such as titanium oxide have the astrological nature of the highly malefic Saturn.
"It will be seen that this scheme follows that of Ptolemy quite closely. In a few instances in which it results in a star being given a nature at variance with that of the classicists, the nature as predicted by the spectra is most generally confirmed by the lore associated with a star. Of course Ptolemy never gave the natures of Uranus, Neptune or Pluto to any of the stars. These planets were unknown in his time. Perhaps future research will rectify this situation and find stars with the nature of one or more of the trans-Saturnian planets. "From the spectral type the astrological nature of the star can be known.
Stellar spectra are rated zero through to nine. K0 means that a star is pure Mars. B5 means that the star is beginning to shade from Jupiter to Venus. These subtleties of meanings can be accounted for in a delineation". (George C Noonan Jr. Fixed Stars and Judicial Astrology, AFA).

Proper Motion of stars: Stars have a "proper motion", but it is very small. It varies with different stars, it has been said that Aldebaran moves only three minutes of arc in 2735 years or one degree in 57,000 years. Alcyone (the brightest of the Pleiades), for example, will move only 0.20" arc seconds per century in right ascension and 4.6 arcseconds per century in declination. What you see as "movement" of the stars is due to precession, amounting to 1.396 degrees per century, which gives the impression that stars are moving at a far faster rate than they really are. In other words, it is not the stars that are moving but the framework used to measure their positions, i.e. the zodiac.
Precession of the stars: The fixed stars cannot be progressed or arced. However they do precess forward in the zodiac at the approximate average rate of 50.23 seconds of arc per year, the same as roughly eight minutes every ten years, or one degree every 72 years. In 100 years they precess at approximately 1degree23 minutes or 83 minutes (or 84).
If a natal planet is at a slightly higher longitude figure in a separating conjunction to a star, that star will precess to a conjunction, giving the energy field of that planet a superimposed profile and brings changes into the life corresponding to the influences of the particular star.
For example, if you were born in 1950 and had a planet at 23Libra50, that planet would be in a separating conjunction with Spica at 23Libra05. In the year 2000, Spica would precess, like a very slow moving transit, to conjunct that planet.
Examples:
1. John Travolta (born Feb 18 1954, 2.53 PM, EST, Englewood) has Jupiter conjunct Rigel which brings honor, riches, glory and renown. His natal Jupiter is at 16Ge32. Travolta became an instant success with the release of the film Saturday Night Fever, in Dec 1977. When Rigel had precessed to the minute of his Jupiter.
2. Robert Kennedy (born Nov 20 1925 3.11 PM, EST, Brooklyn) had Pluto at 14Cancer30. When he was born, Canopus was at 13Can57. Canopus, when linked to the outer planets, has associations with violent, public and sudden death. When he was assassinated in 1968, Canopus had precessed to 14Can30, and conjuncted his Pluto to the minute.
Latitude from the ecliptic: Most fixed stars are positioned outside the ecliptic and many have large latitude from the Ecliptic and large declinations from the Celestial Equator. Many such as; Polaris, the Pole Star, stars in the constellations Argo, Crux, Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, Draco, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, Perseus and its star Algol, etc. have very large latitudes. Some astrologers offer the opinion that fixed stars with large latitudes or more than 17 degrees latitude from the ecliptic (Pluto's orbit) are of no use in practical interpretation. However, Ebertin (Fixed Stars by Ebertin-Hoffman, published by AFA) says that practice does not bear out this opinion. Moreover, he says; practice shows that a star's high latitude does not appear to matter at all.
Example, taking the star Polaris, the Pole star, which marks the North Pole and has the largest declination from the equator +89.15'. and the largest latitude from the ecliptic +66.05'.

If we did not believe that zodiacal positions were valid, we would not expect Polaris to be activated using zodiacal measurements in events concerning the North Pole.
Six events relating to the North Pole and its polar axis the South Pole, four of which show that Polaris is activated:
1)April, 15 1800, born Sir James Clark Ross, Scottish explorer of the Arctic and Antarctic. He was the first to locate the magnetic North Pole; he discovered and named Mount Erebus in Antarctica. - Jupiter/Polaris.
2)May 6 1856, Robert Peary, Arctic Explorer and first person to the North Pole, was born in Cresson, Pennsylvania. - Saturn/Polaris.
3)Sep 6 1909, word is received that Robert Peary has reached the North Pole and died. Pluto/Polaris.
4) Dec 14 1911 Norwegian explorer reaches the south pole - Pluto/Polaris (Polaris is the star on the North Pole, the south pole is on the polar axis, there is no south pole-star).
Ocultation: Sometimes a planet will conjunct a star by longitude and ecliptic latitude and will physically occultate it. This happens all the time, of course, but much more rarely with the 290 or so named stars we consider of traditional importance. With this type of conjunction or occultation the energy of the fixed star would be far more greatly emphasized.
Dr Gonzales Tamez says, "A convenient way to study a given star is when the Moon physically occultates it"(or even skims a star). "There are certain big stars that the Moon frequently occultates, sometimes once a month for several months in a row, so you can collect a series of observations of the validity of the traditional keywording for the said star. Obviously the same can be said for when a planet conjuncts a zodiacal star both in longitude and in ecliptic latitude, because then the star will shine through with full strength and its nature will reveal itself to the attentive eye. I have found that specific stars tend to project clusters of synchronistic coincidences. Quite often the name of the constellation will play a role, particularly for stars classified in planetary terms as sharing some Mercurial quality. The fixed stars often bring about bizarre synchronicities and clustering of coincidences that may involve the meaning of the star and the constellation it is in."
One more reason why people believe the stars don't work is because of the lack of knowledge of their meanings, because the traditional interpretations, although they can be very 'spot on', have a tendency to dwell on the negative influences and show a lack of an overall comprehension of their meanings. Hopefully in time and with proper application of empirical evidence, we can be more definite about the possibilities within the meanings of the fixed stars. All the fixed stars in a native’s chart have very strong impact on his life.

HOW TO JUDGE THE NATURE OF FIXED STARS
In the Tetrabiblos, Ptolemy refers to natures of stars in constellations. In only a few cases did he describe specific stars. The astrological natures of the stars (given under the heading 'Planetary natures' like; Mars-Mercury, Saturn, Venus, Mars-Jupiter, Venus-Saturn etc.) are similar to the natures of the planets. Confusion permeates this matter in modern astrology because Ptolemy mentions very few stars by name and some of these do have multiple natures. Ptolemy mostly described groups of stars as having the same influence, such as; “The stars in the shoulders of Aquarius operate like Saturn and Mercury;” “the bright one in the northern wing (of Virgo), called Vindemiator (now called Vindemiatrix) “ is of the same influence as Saturn and Mercury; “ The bright stars in the constellation of the Little Bear have a similar quality to that of Saturn, and to a less degree, to that of Venus...” Those bright stars in the constellation of the Dragon, to that of Saturn, Mars and Jupiter and so on.
Vivian Robson (The Fixed Stars and Constellations in Astrology) says, "A fixed star in conjunction with a planet of the same character greatly emphasizes the qualities of that planet. If the star is of contrary nature to the planet which it conjuncts" (and the main fixed stars have all been classified as having greater or lesser affinities to the planets) "it should hinder the planet. If a planet falls upon a star the effect is greatly magnified, giving it prominence in the life that is quite unwarranted by its mere position and aspects in the chart. Cases are known to all astrologers in which a certain planet in the horoscope seems to be emphasized for no apparent reason, so that it acts drastically throughout the life, and in such a case there is usually a fixed star in operation in the background through the planet. The greatest effect is obtained when the star and planet are both of the same nature and in such cases the influence of the planet is raised to a vehement pitch, though at the same time the malefic effect of the star is diminished. Thus if the planet Mars falls upon a star of its own nature its power is increased; if upon a star of the nature of Jupiter or Venus it is reduced and modified while if upon one of the nature of Saturn it is greatly changed. In other words, if a planet falls upon a star of similar nature to its own it acquires intensity, while upon one of contrary nature it becomes quiescent or distorted and may give a kind of sudden or dull effect to the character". He goes on to say that in all cases the fixed stars do not contradict the planetary indications. "A man will not become a murderer, thief or forger through the effect of the star alone, and for this to take place the general nature of the chart must be suitable and in harmony with such indications concerned. The exact nature and effect must be sought through ordinary rules of astrology. Similarly, in directions the action of the stars is much more potent if a planetary direction of a like nature is in force at the same time. It should be borne in mind that they are of transitory nature.
We are told that Ptolemy gave no rules for their determination of the nature of the stars. Agrippa tells us that the natures of the fixed stars are known from the similarity of their colours to those of the planets, as described below:
Saturn blue, leaden and shining Jupiter citron near to paleness and clear Mars red and fiery

Sun yellow and when rising red, afterwards glittering Venus white and shinning / white in the morning and reddish in the evening Mercury glittering Moon fair Uranus bright and greenish Neptune greenish, but not so bright.
The generally accepted method of expressing the kind of influence exerted by any star is in terms of the planets of our Solar System. The effect of the stars of any given nature in terms of natal astrology is as follows:
Uranus: interest in occultism, electricity, aviation, antiquities, abrupt. If rising, eccentricity gained by learning. If culminating, learned, eminent in arts and sciences, mechanical and inventive ability.
Saturn: disgrace, ruin, calamity. If rising, grave, thoughtful, melancholy, liable to disgrace, much care and anxiety, connected with building, mines and minerls. If on the seventh cusp and Moon afflicted by Saturn, ruler of seventh, a slovenly wife. If culminating, trouble through old people, disgrace, trade losses, deceitful associates, rise followed by fall. With the luminaries, lean and infirm, many miseries. If afflicting Mercury, deafness.
Jupiter: If rising, sober, grave, patient, legacies, ecclesiastical preferment. If culminating, honour, glory, preferment, success in trade and in the Church.
Mars: violent death, ultimate ruin by folly or pride. If rising, wealth, power, courage, generosity, ingenuity, rise to authority, martial success, subject to cuts, wounds, accidents, sores and injuries to the face, pains in the head and fevers. If culminating, martial eminence, success in trade and in occupations of a Mars nature. If afflicting Mercury, deafness.
Venus: If rising, good fortune, happiness, gifts, fortunate for love and marriage, gain by legacies and inheritance. If culminating, honour and success, dealings with and help through women, success in occupations of a Venus nature.
Mercury: If rising, honour, intellect, gret learning. If culminating, business activity, gain through books and intellectual matters.
When two or more planets are mentioned, the one whose name is mentioned first is considered to represent the chief influence of the star. The second one denotes a kind of modifying influence.

For example, a star like Regulas, of the nature of Mars and Jupiter would give the following influences:
i. Mars comes first, hence it is the chief influence of the star- purely martial qualities.
ii. As Jupiter comes second, it has a modifying influence on Mars. Here, Jupiter gives an expansiveness to the martial qualities.
This would give the exact nature of the star.
After this, it should be combined with the: • sign • decanate occupied by the star • planet and • house through which the star is acting in any given birth chart.
How to judge the nature of little known stars?
a) Use the above method (combination of the sign, decanate occupied by the star along with the planet and the house) and use the general characteristics of the constellation to which it belongs.
b) Modify these characteristics by the sign, decanate and house occupied, together with the aspects to the planets and the houses it rules just as would be done in the case of an ordinary planetary conjunction.
c) For its strength judge it position: whether angular, succeedant or cadent.
d) For the orb, find out its magnitude.
Interpretations of the nature of the stars having different planetary combinations:
Saturn and Jupiter : Dignified, pious, conservative, acquisitive, retentive.
If culminating: honour and preferment
Saturn and Mars : bold, cruel, heartless, adulterous, criminal, liar, loss of estates,poverty, few friends.
If of 1st magnitude: rises by usury or unfair means.
If culminating: bad name, rise by trade followed by disgrace and ruin.
Saturn and Venus: : Slovenly, very immoral, shameless, revolting, mean, sorrows in love.
If rising: good tempered, healthy, gain by industry and marriage.
If culminating: improved health, fame by help of superiors.

INTERPRETATION OF THE FIXED STARS SINCE ANCIENT TIMES IN COMPARISON TO MODERN INTERPRETATIONS
Since ancient times people have dedicated their lives in studying and interpreting the fixed stars. Below are the Interpretations of the fixed stars by Anonymous of year 379 A.B, translated first in Italian by Giuseppe Bezza from CCAG V/1 pp. 194-211 and later in English by Daria Dudziak. The footnotes of the author have been maintained in their original form. As the interpretations making interesting reading, I felt that the original form be maintained and printed for the readers interest and knowledge.
Bright, passionate, harmful and helpful stars. [This text was published by F. Cumont in the first tome of the fifth volume of Catalogus Codicum Astrologorum Graecorum (CCAG), pag. 194-211., it was included in Rhetorius' works (Rhet.) in the VI century and it has been taken and used again by Teophilus of Edessa (CCAG V/1 pp. 212-217). Between the end of the VIII century and the beginning of the IX century it appeared in a drawing up which includes some glosses (EP). At a certain time, the list of these thirty bright stars became formal in the astrological judgements: in Vaticanus graecus 208, fo. 130v, the following explanatory note has been added to the list of these stars: "These are thirty bright stars which we use in the prediction of the events according to the rules of great Ptolemy..." (D. Pingree, The Astrological School of John Abramius, Dumbarton Oaks Papers, 1971, pag. 209). Another text was written during Latin Middle Ages. It was an extremely similar text(VL), which was the translation of the original Arabic text, wherein the bright stars were named beibenia and they entered the medieval, astrological lexicon with this term. Jerome Vitali in his Lexicon mathematicum, says that beibenia are the main stars of the starry images, in particular their hearts and the stars of the first magnitude. (Lexicon mathematicum, astronomicum, geometricum, Parisiis 1668,pag. 84. Cfr. the commentary on the pseudoPtolemaic centiloquium, ascribed to 'Al" ibn Ridwän, but this work was written by ibn alDäya, v. 27: "Beibenie, id est fixe qui sunt corda fixarum, sicut cor tauris et cor leonis et cor scorpionis, sc. ille que sunt in orbe signorum ex prima magnitudine"). Al-Bîrûnî says that this term derives from neo-Persian biyâbânî, that is, the stars of the desert, the name that Persians would have given to some bright stars, since whether you could find the straight and narrow path in the desert or not depended on them (Al-Bîrûnî, The Book of Instruction in the Elements of the Art of Astrology, ed. R. Wright, London 1934, pag. 46, ¤ 125). Unfortunately, this suggestive etymology is wrong and we have to say that this name refers to and derives from middle Persian (pahlavi) a-wiyâbân-îg, term by which lack of movement, the fact that something is fixed, is designated (Cfr. W.B. Henning, An Astronomical Chapter of the Bundahishn, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1942, p. 229; P. Kunitzsch, Beibenian stars - al-kawâkib al-biyâbânîya. Ein Nachtrag, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 1981 (131, 2), pag. 263-267).

When in a geniture we find the Moon which is drawing near to one of the bright and great stars or else the Moon has almost the same degree as this star has and especially when the Moon moves in the same direction [katà tòn ánemon tòn autón. Ánemos,ventus, it means a direction in the space and a co-ordinate in the Celestial Sphere that can be latitude or declination without distinction. The author wants to say that the Moon brings itself near or else it draws near to one of the bright stars in longitude having the same direction with reference to the ecliptic as the bright star has] in which the shining star that is close to it in degrees moves; these conditions give rise to great, brilliant, eminent and opulent genitures. The same way, if one of the bright stars is at the horoscope or it rises in the moment of birth or if it is perpendicular when it is culminating or if it is in another Angle, it bears glorious people, the powerful, people who are in command, who have a lot of activities, who have much property and who are the owners of many things, who are well-known or feared in the cities and in the regions. In particular, people born in these situations will be famous in the regions dominated by the bright stars or else in those regions above which these stars rise at the same moment in which someone is born, as it is noted in the table.
If they rise at the horoscope or they culminate at the top of the sky they give prosperity since youth and in the native town; but if at the moment of birth one of these bright stars is in the angle of setting, it brings well-being about, but especially abroad and around middleage and it gives a splendid marriage and several and considerable possessions, particularly owing to the female sex. If at the moment of delivery one of these bright stars is in the underground centre (the subterranean angle), it brings prosperity and well-being to the person who is born, especially during his or her old age and on account of deposits or credits or trust legacies since this place is invisible; this person's death is eminent, outstanding and known by everybody: by this place, in fact, we judge the esteem [Testo: ghénesin, Cumont suggerisce timên.] after the body's death. Therefore, we consider that the things we said as far as the dignities are concerned are sufficient and to sum up we can say that: usually, every person who is born at the rising of a bright star or when a bright star is angular or when the Moon is drawing near to it, at the moment of childbirth, as above-mentioned, is going to have a wonderful, splendid and distinguished life and is going to be famous.
The natural action of these stars is really great, mighty admirable and varied and the effects they bring to an end are different according to the changes of the places, for which reason it is necessary for us to state and explain the observations our predecessors made with regard to their peculiar disposition. Hence, since every unwandering star has a close relationship with the planets and with their congeneric disposition, every star has the same virtue and carries out the same things that the planets do, as the writer says: it is not necessary to consider only the way five stars and the Sun and the Moon are combined and mixed between them (their aspects),but also with reference to those unwandering stars which have the same nature as they have [Cfr. Ptolemy, quadr. 2,8: «We shall begin with the characteristics active powers of the planets, one by one, first, however, making this general observation, as a summary reminder, that in general whenever we speak of any temperament of the five planets one must understand that whatever produces the like nature is also meant, whether it be the planet itself in its own proper condition, or one of the fixed stars, or one of the signs of the zodiac, considered with reference to the temperament proper to it, just as though the characterizations were applied to the natures or the qualities themselves and not to the planets; and let us remember that in the combinations, again, we must consider not only the mixture of the planets one with another, but also



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 129 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
their combination with the others that share in the same nature, whether they be fixed stars or signs of the zodiac, by virtue of their affinities with the planets, already set forth».]
These considerations can be made according to the distinctive features they have in common with the wandering stars and which are included and described in the table since their effective qualities and the virtues they carry out are the same. There can be no doubt about the fact that we can find this identification of the unwandering stars only in the texts of few ancients, in particular in the works of people who have considered and discussed this part of prediction and foretelling as well as the divine science of numbers. In truth, some of the ancients expounded the knowledge and explained the nature and the properties of the phenomena sparsely and in an obscure way. As far as we are concerned, we wanted to keep the memory of it to people who are worthy of the stars and we have taken from the astrological doctrine all the useful things that Ptolemy had expounded in this science. Then, we were first to process the data and to draw up and make up this more recent, intelligible and easily understandable table which shows all the learning and the knowledge of the celestial phenomena. Here should have been put in the abovementioned table, but it is missing in the manuscript. Since we do not want our exposition to be too wordy and the table seem too obscure, we start to make you known the effective virtue of every unwandering star as we have entered in the table the degree of longitude at which every star was in the time of Olybrius' and Ausonius' consulate [Decimus Magnus Ausonius and Q. Clodius Hermogenianus Olybrius were consuls in 379 A.D.] that is in the year in which we have composed this treatise. In truth, as divine Ptolemy has shown, during hundred years the stars move one degree towards the parts that follow the equinoxes and the solstices [eis tà hepómena tôn tropikôn sêméiôn. Sêméia tropikà; these are puncta conversiva and they designate both the solstices and the equinoxes.]
Besides, we have told and explained what the temperament of every star is, what its latitude or direction [póion plátos êtoi ánemos.] is according to the information he had handed down so that nothing is ignored or omitted in the exposition and explanation of the table. Therefore, let us move on to the illustration of the table.
About people who [Here begins the text of EP and Rhet., preceded by a brief introduction: "On the virtue of the unwandering stars. Besides, I thought it necessary to expound and explain the virtue and the action of the unwandering stars since their force is great and strong when they are in the same degree in which the angles and the planets are and as learned Julian says in his Apotelesmata, they seem to give rise to illustrious, distinguished, eminent (perod-xous, Rhet.: parad-xous, admirable, wonderful) and singular, uncommon nativities. The places of the unwandering stars, both for their longitude and for their latitude, correspond to the year 600 (884 A.D.) from the age of Diocletian's reign". The last sentence we have quoted is not included in Rhet] are born at the rising of Spica ,the bright star which is in the left hand of Virgo and which is in the 29th degree of Virgo and which also <lies> in the zodiac or when the bright star of Lyra, which comes up with the 20th degree of Sagittarius, rises at the horoscope or at the rising of the bright star that is in the mouth of the Greater Fish(Piscis Australis)and which is in the southern part <of the zodiac> and which rises together with the 10th degree of Aquarius or else when the bright star of the Bird , which rises at the same time as the 12th degree of Leo, is at the horoscope or finally at the rising of the bright star of Corona Borealis (northern)that rises together with the 16th degree of Libra. Since all these stars have the temperament and nature of Venus and

Mercury, if one of them rises at the horoscope [Rhet.: When these stars are in the same degree of the horoscope or of the top of the sky... ], not only does it make the natives well-known, famous and resourceful, but also very learned and erudite, fond of philosophical dissertations, eloquent, creative, perspicacious, ingenious and clever, keen on music and arts and goodhearted. These natives are also nice and pleasant, they like fine and voluptuous things, they have a delicate palate and prefer peaceful and soft activities, they are cheerful and merry, wise, sensible and reflective as well as able, skilful and lucky. They learn utterly by themselves and are esteemed for the virtue and quality of their reasoning; they have inclination to all that is virtuous, their speech and language are pleasant and people willingly listen to them, they are loveable, gracious and well moderate in their morals and behaviour, they are solicitous and careful, they have the knack of considering all the aspects of life with wisdom and sense and behaving in a reasonable way and they are generous [VL adds: "And this happens when Saturn is above the eastern horizon and it watches Venus. And if one of these stars is at the ascendant, the native gains wisdom, knowledge and political and civil authority, on condition that Saturn is not at the ascendant. If, on the contrary, Saturn with one of these stars is at the ascendant, the person who is born is inclined to banquets and feasts, to enjoyment and pleasures, drinking and lying with women. If Saturn is at the ascendant with the Sun and Venus is in the fourth place, or else if Saturn with Venus or with one of these stars is in the tenth place, the native will not be lucky and none of the abovementioned things will be in his nature since he will be cold or impotent in the coition or else all his children will be girls. In truth, these stars tend to bring bad things and misfortune when Saturn and Venus join them in the angles".] Sometimes, if Mars is eastern above the horizon and it observes one of these stars at its rising, they make the natives promiscuous and easily moved to the pleasures of Venus. If Mars is angular, the natives are involved in some troubles because of documents or driven by passion, especially if Mercury [There is a brief blank here, Kroll suggests Hermês. The readings proposed by Rhet. and EP are unintelligible and obscure: eàn málista, hoútôs ôn Árês, pròs hêlion hôronomêsêi (Rhet.). eàn málista Árês pròs hêlion hôronomêsêi (EP).] rises when Mars is in the position which has been described above. If Venus or Mars observes one of these stars at its rising from the place of anti-culmination, men who are the opposites of chaste, wise and judicious people, are born as well as impious and wicked men and people who are impotent in the pleasures of Venus or who have few children or only daughters. In fact, a big difference originates from the unlike placing of Venus and Mars in the angles. If Saturn observes one of these five, bright stars at its rising, expert doctors of medicine, skilful in predictions and forecasting and devoted to the occult
books and initiation into the mysteries [VL adds: "And if these stars observe Saturn and Venus
from the seventh place, the native will be a learned doctor of medicine...".] are born. If Jupiter observes one of these five, bright stars at its rising, it brings a greater prosperity and more commands, authority, glory and power [VL adds: "And if you see that Mercury is at the ascendant or in the tenth place with one of these stars, the native will be a prophet and he or she will look great in the eyes of men and he or she will be a philosopher, inventor or inventress of sciences and he or she will have knowledge of everything, above all of those sciences that originate from the region of Babylonia. If the nativity is nocturnal and Mercury is placed in the aboveexplained way and Mars is in the sixth place from Mercury, right-hand with reference to the ascendant, the native will be an idolater or an idolatress and he or she will be very famous, will say prophetic words and perform miracles, but only God knows the truth".]
Moreover, there is a big difference between these stars: Spica makes people become the interpreters of sacred things, high, supreme, honoured and respected priests or philosophers



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY

or the inspired interpreters of some mysteries and, especially among people who are born in Hellas and in the female genitures, it makes the natives the priestesses of Demeter that is of mother of gods or of Core or of Isis as well as women who are the interpreters of sacred things or experts in mysteries or in initiation rites or they who refuse to eat some aliments and who are helped by the gods very much. If the bright star of Corona borealis (northern) rises or culminates, thanks to it the natives become glorious, stephanêphoroi (people who are crowned during competitions), high priests, kings' friends and it makes them have a strong and vigorous body and become famous and loved by many people. If the bright star of Piscis Australis (the Southern Fish) rises, because of it the natives have few children or have children very late or have only daughters or do not have children at all and are very eloquent and good-looking .
[ EP inserts here an additional note which seems to be a gloss, an explanatory annotation: "When these unwandering stars are at the upper culmination with the Sun or with the Moon or with the Part of Fortune (Pars Fortunae), those stars that have the temperament and nature of Venus and of Mercury are a help to the question of slaves, especially if Jupiter is united or configured with them and also if Mars gives its virtue to Jupiter. Corona Borealis denotes clerics, clergymen and metropolitans. Piscis Australis(the Greater Fish) slows the outcome and the successful result of an initiative, an undertaking, but it makes it beautiful. The stars which have the temperament and nature of Mars and of Jupiter are extremely good for the office of governors, kings and military leaders, for people with an indomitable character who do not accept to be subdued, soldiers and satraps. The stars which have the temperament and nature of Saturn and of Jupiter favour and are propitious for laying the bases of the foundations of temples, cities and towns, houses and the like. The stars that have the temperament and nature of only one planet that is of Mars are propitious and favourable for robbery, brigandage and for a military expedition. The stars which have the temperament and nature of Jupiter and of Mercury favour and are advantageous for pious, merciful and religious deeds and for the public government. The stars which have the temperament and nature of Mars and of Mercury are favourable and propitious for mechanical arts and crafts, deceits and swindles, murders, forgeries, misfortunes and accidents. The stars that have only the temperament and nature of Venus (Centaurus, the foot of the chained woman, the left foot of the woman) favour and are propitious for people who have a generous heart and character, who are benevolent and kind and whose nature is not tricky and deceptive at all and who are honest and fair in their advice as well as for the promotion and advancement of people who are simple, natural and plain, singular and uncommon and who have an humble and modest character. The stars which have the temperament and nature of Saturn and of Venus (the stained hand, the woman who is on the throne, the head of Ophiuchus) favour the successful and lucky purchases which come from a wrong and which are secret, the enrichment which derives from other people's misfortunes. The shining star of the Hyades is favourable for a man who has much property and owns many things, who is powerful, prosperous, extremely rich and who subdues cities and towns. Moreover, if Mars is opposite, it favours the satrapies". "The stained hand": chéir bebamménê, corresponds to beta Cassiopeia that is called alkaff al-khadîb (Sûfî 83).] What happens if someone is born at the rising of the bright star that is in Lion's heart and which lies in the circle of the zodiac at the 20th degree of Leo or at the rising of Arcturus or Arctophilax at the horoscope, the star which rises together with the thirtieth degree of Virgo or at the rising of the bright star of Aquila , which rises together with the seventh degree of Capricorn or if someone is born at the rising of Antares at the horoscope , which lies in the zodiac in the 15th degree of Scorpius (Scorpio); since all the above-mentioned stars have the temperament and nature of Jupiter and of Mars. Therefore, if one of these stars rises at the horoscope or it comes up at the moment of delivery or culminates, it makes people who are born with a disposition of this kind become illustrious

- 132 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
generals that subdue regions and cities and peoples, it makes them people who govern, who are inclined to action and act quickly, people who are not submissive and do not accept to be subdued, people who speak frankly, who have a taste for struggle and take pleasure in fighting. They also bring their plans to an end, they are efficient, virile, victorious, they harm their enemies, they are opulent and possibly immensely rich, they are brave and highsouled, they are also ambitious [ Rhet. adds: philokálous.] and usually they do not die well [VL: "Et morietur bona morte"..]. Moreover, in this case people who are keen on hunting as well as experts in and owners of horses and quadrupeds are born.
Here below we describe what happens if someone is born at the rising of the bright star that is at the tip of the left foot of Orion and which rises together with the twenty-third degree of Taurus or at the rising of the medial star of three stars that are in Orion's Belt (Cingulum Orionis) and which rises at the same time as the 30th degree of Taurus rises or at the rising of the star set on the right shoulder of Auriga and which rises together with the 5th degree of Gemini or at the rising of the star set in the knee of Sagittarius and which is in the zodiac at the 19th degree of Sagittarius or at the rising of the bright star set in the Gorgonifer of Perseus and which rises together with the second degree of Taurus. Since all these stars have the temperament and nature of Jupiter and of Saturn, if they rise at the horoscope in the same way as we have said, in a geniture, the natives own a lot of things, they are very rich and they have possessions in several countries and cities or towns, they are countryloving people [VL: "Amator quietis et letitie et amat quod bene dicatur de eo".] and they have a bent for and are skilful at building houses. Moreover, if the Moon watches one of these bright stars at its rising or at its culmination in the daytime, the natives have a virtuous nature, they are respectful to the old, they are people of noble sentiments, they are generous, tolerant, wise and sensible and they love their dear ones [VL: "Et si luna aspexerit aliquam ex illis et fuerit luna in ascendente vel decima erit pietate plenus et ornamento simplex et fortunatus, patiens iniuriarum, sapiens in omnibus, amat homines et amatur ab eis"]. In particular, the rising and the culmination at right angles of the bright star set in the knee of Sagittarius or of the star that is on the right shoulder of Auriga makes the natives work with quadrupeds or with carts as well as people who have the knack of riding horses and driving carts or wagons [VL: "Et dixit Hermes quod illa que est in Sagittario licet habeat omnia ista in se, tamen natus amat aves et bestias et erit bonus equitator et habebit domum in qua habebit aquilas et aves multas; et deus est sapiens in illo"]. What happens if someone is born at the rising of Canis (the Dog) which rises together with the 20th degree of Gemini or at the rising of the star set in the head of the following Twin that lies in the zodiac at the 29th degree of Gemini. Therefore, if these stars, which have the temperament and nature of the star of Mars, rise at the horoscope, especially in a nocturnal geniture, a person who is born is fit for being in command, skilful, expert and clever, energetic and vigorous, active, temerarious and foolhardy, is not submissive and do not accept to be subdued. Moreover, the native is yearning and greedy, hard-hearted, tough, proud and haughty, a military leader, tyrannical, glorious. On the contrary, if these stars rise at the horoscope in a diurnal geniture they make the natives insolent, cruel, pitiless and without mercy, rash and hasty, rapacious, troubled and intoxicated. If they culminate they make the native become wise, sensible and merciful, but he or she usually does not die well.
What happens if someone is born at the rising of the star set in the northern chela of Scorpio that lies in the circle of the zodiac at the 25th degree of Libra or at the rising of the star which is in the head of the previous Twin since both of them have the temperament and

- 133 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
nature of Jupiter and Mercury. If these stars rise at the horoscope the natives become fond of literature and humanities, scholars, popular orators, ingenious and clever people, keen on music and arts, people who hit the target, good-looking, able to carry on a lot of activities and skilful at many things, dignified, pious, religious, suitable for and capable of doing business, very well-known or people who purchase gold and silver and other riches thanks to relations, connections or successful trading and who keep their noble feelings and nature even during their misfortunes. This happens especially in a diurnal geniture. On the contrary, if these stars rise at the horoscope in a nocturnal geniture the natives think and pretend to be learned and wise while they are boastful, affected, simulators and shammers, nevertheless, they are erudite, they have a good memory, they are capable of and suitable for teaching and their desires are pure.
What happens if the bright star set in the previous shoulder of Orion which rises together with the 27th degree of Taurus or Procyon that rises together with the 27th degree of Cancer or if the star set in the right shoulder of Orion and which rises together with the second degree of Gemini or the star which the Horse (Pegasus) and Andromeda have in common and which rises together with the 21st degree of Pisces, rise at the horoscope in a geniture. These stars have Mars' and Mercury's temperament and nature and they make military heads and leaders, people who are valiant, able, skilled, strong and vigorous as well as full of energy, versatile, cunning and shrewd, people who are capable of doing a lot of varied activities and are competent at many things. These stars also give rise to wise and sensible people, with a shrill voice, deceptive people and they make people who are successful and have good results, obstinate and stubborn people, they who are impetuous, impulsive, insatiable and greedy in their desires, who corrupt both young boys and maidens, perjurers and oath-breakers; especially in the nocturnal genitures. If they rise at the horoscope in a diurnal geniture they make the natives become audacious and bold, fierce, people who are inclined to repent and often change their mind, false and deceitful, thieves, godless, friendless, simulators and shammers, insolent, people who stain themselves with murder, forgers and counterfeiters, cheats and swindlers and these natives sometimes do not die well. This happens especially in a diurnal geniture [nykterinês has to be corrected in hêmerinês.] What happens if at the moment of childbirth the bright star which is set in the right foot of Centaurus and which rises together with the 11th degree of Libra or the last one of the River which rises together with the third degree of Aries, rises. Both of them have the temperament and nature of Jupiter and of Venus and if they rise at the moment of birth they make the natives become pure and honest, nice, agreeable and pleasing, fond of music, fond of their friends and friendly, pious, liberal, generous and munificent, wise and sensible, fond of listening to other people. These people are men of good judgement and give good advice, they have a noble and majestic mind, a kind heart, they are people of good feelings, selfpossessed and moderate in the pleasures of love and they are greatly favoured by women. They also look for renown and they are honest and virtuous, their hair is on the blond side and they are good-looking and a delicate and frail body [VL: humide complexionis.], especially if these stars observe the Moon. What happens if someone is born at the rising of the bright star set in the Lion's tail that lies in the zodiac in the 27th degree of Leo or at the rising of the star that is in its flank and which is in the 17th degree of Leo or at the rising of the bright star of the Hydra, the star which rises together with the 3rd degree of Leo. These stars have the temperament and nature of Saturn and of Venus and if they come up at the hour of birth they make the natives prosperous, they make them have many possessions and

- 134 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
really well-known and also people who are subject and slave to passions, do obscene and indecent things or speak effeminately [VL: erit turpis facie, verborum humidorum, amator plantarum et arationum et seminum et edificiorum, fornicator in rebus mulierum.]. Moreover, these stars make the natives people who love the virtue and who criticise the pleasures of love using stern and severe words and as the years go by and they get older they take part in some priestly offices and services; people who are esteemed for some kind of religious practice or owing to their self-control and composure, people who refuse to eat some aliments and who are expert in occult books; the natives also become fond of sciences of the sky, their eyes are rather grey [VL: nigros habens oculos.] and sparkling and they are good-looking.
What happens if the bright star of Hyades which is in the circle of the zodiac at the 15th degree of Taurus, rises at the moment of delivery. This star has the temperament and nature of Mars and of Venus and is in Venus' domicile(domal dignity). Thanks to it the natives become prosperous and very rich and they subdue and govern towns, cities and regions. As this star and the position of the Hyades in the whole universe is the easiest to recognise for all the men and the most visible and conspicuous, in the same way they who are born when the bright star of the Hyades comes up or else when it is at the horoscope are by far the most glorious, more known and famous and richer than all the other men. It produces the same things when it is in the same degree in which the Moon is as they rise together at the same moment. In truth, only this star has a double force compared to other stars: in fact, when it rises, the shining star of Antares which is set in the diametrically opposed degree that is in the 15th degree of Scorpio, sets; these stars are both in the circle of the zodiac. Therefore, they have the faculty of producing great, distinguished and eminent conditions both in western parts and in eastern parts, as well as in any other region of the earth. When the star of Antares is in the angle of the setting, in the place concerning the marital unions, it brings, as we have said, great prosperity, great riches and wealth thanks to women. In truth, the wives of men who are born in this condition are illustrious, distinguished and very rich, however they are not long-lived since Antares sets quickly when it is in the place of nuptials. When the bright star of the Hyades which has in itself the effective quality of the action and influence of Mars and of Venus rises on the horizon, it makes the person who is born in these conditions full of anger and fiery and passionate in his or her desires and vigorous and full of energy [diaphórôs was the correction made by Kroll, who followed Rhet. to whom the second meaning of "excellently" has to be attributed, cfr. VL: fortis in opere venereo. In the text there is: diaph-rous, EP: adiaphorous.] in the pleasures of love. On the other hand, when the place of the Hyades itself, from the 11th to the 15th degree <of Taurus>, rises at the horoscope, it produces by its very nature people who are subject to passions in the enjoyments and pleasures, famous, distinguished and illustrious people, people with a beautiful neck.
We have determined and decided these judgements after careful observations and examinations in a sufficient span of time. In fact, we have often noticed distinguished, eminent and illustrious nativities of great prosperity in which any consideration indicating good things was lacking. We have noticed and observed great and very, very happy nativities wherein neither the Luminaries nor the benefic <planets> were angular, but they were falling so that it was impossible to come to a right and correct understanding and interpretation without observing the bright stars rising together with the angles or with the Moon. For this reason, we have explained different actions and influences of the bright,



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 135 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
illustrious and prominent stars, leaving out only the star of Canopus which as it is very southern, it does not appear in our regions since our observations take place at the latitude of Rome.
Following the exposition and the explanation of divine Ptolemy we intended to relate the judgements concerning the action, the influence and the quality of 30 bright stars. Therefore, we remember and mention they who have written about the action and the influence [perì tês tôn aplanôn <energheías>; Cumont suggests: pháseôs.] of the unwandering stars, about their virtue and about the images of celestial bodies rising together: as we know from our precursors, the Babylonians and the Chaldeans were perhaps the first people who discovered the science of celestial phenomena. Afterwards, there were Apollonius Mindius and Artemidorus. Berossus and his disciples have also written about the unwandering stars. Ancient Egyptians mentioned them and made predictions based on the stars. First of them was Hermes Trismegistos who wrote about the rising of Sirius in his 'On the effects that the stars produce in the world' [en tóis kosmikóis apotelésmasi.] and Necao, Cherasphorus, Petosiris and Nechepso as well as others, in different regions, wrote about the stars, in particular Timeus and Asclation. Taking advantage of these authors, they who followed observed the rising, the setting and other indicative signs that the stars make at any latitude, making their observations in many different places and they recorded, almost everyday, the effective quality of their action and influence. These scholars were: Meton, Apollinarius and Euctemon in Athens, Dositeus in Ionia, Calippus in Hellespont, Philip in Peloponnese, in Phocis and in Locris, Hipparchus in Bitinia. All of them contributed to the knowledge of the virtue and of the quality of the action and influence of the stars. In truth, if at their rising and during other phases they change to a certain extent the constitution of the air, even more so they can bring us great prosperity and well-being or adverse and unfavourable situations and sometimes death by virtue of their contact with the significators of life [katà tàs tôn aphetôn kollêseis. The whole passage is oddly similar to the gloss of the Phaseis by Ptolemy: "I have described and put in order the announcements of all these apparitions according to the Egyptians, to Dositeus, Philip, Calippus, Euctemon, Meton, Conon, Metrodorus, Eudossus, Caesar, Democritus, Hipparchus. As far as all these scholars are concerned, the Egyptians made the observations here, in our country, Dositeus in Coo(Cos), Philip in Peloponnese, in Locris and in Phocis, Calippus in Hellespont, Meton and Euctemon in Athens and in the Cyclades, in Macedonia e in Thrace, Conon and Metrodorus in Italy and in Sicily, Eudossus in Asia, in Sicily and in Italy, Caesar in Italy, Hipparcus in Bitinia, Democritus in Macedonia e in Thrace", cf. Cl. Ptolemæi Opera astronomica minora, ed. J.L. Heiberg, Lipsiae 1907, pag. 66,23- 67,11.]. Antiocus, Valens, Antigonus, Heraiscus as well as others wrote many and various things about these stars' virtue, as it may be seen in their treatises. Serapion and Ptolemy, who came after him, composed judgements on the stars. Nevertheless, none of all those who we have mentioned had deduced astronomically neither the places in which these stars lie at the present time nor the effective quality of their temperament and nature. Therefore, after we have stated and expounded the qualities and the specific effects of the bright stars, now we are going to treat the quality and the effectiveness of some minor stars with an exposition and expounding as in conformity with the natural criterions as possible.

On the places that excite and provoke passions or on the parts of the enigmatic signs of Aries, of Taurus, of Leo and of Capricon.
In the circle of the signs there are other places lying in the limbs of the figures wherein there are not any stars of the first or of the second magnitude, but smaller, minor stars which have however a sufficient and perhaps immutable force. These stars are observed especially as far as the sensitive part of the soul and of the mind as well as the infirmities and illnesses of the body are concerned. First of all men and women who are born when the following parts rise or ascend at the same time at the horoscope: the fore parts or Aries" face [Scorpius in the text, the reading which is evidently wrong since the list of the enigmatic signs appears twice in the writing.] at 13 and 14 degrees and its back at about 25, 26, 27, 28 degrees and the Hyades or Taurus' face at 12, 13, 14, 15 degrees and moreover the back of Leo from 25 degrees to 30 degrees and the face that is the muzzle of Capricorn at about 10 <and> 12 degrees; incur emotional disorders, depressions and passions. When these places ascend at the same time and rise, as we have explained above, they urge and induce people who are born in this situation to act immorally and dissolutely, not only towards women, but also towards young boys and to delight in the pleasures against nature and with women that submit and yield to passions and are subject to flows [gynaixìn pathêtikáis kái rheumatikáis. rheumatikós, fluxionibus obnoxius, which Kroll understands as: "profluviis albis laborans".] and are also obscene and indecent [I translate aischropois, term by which especially fellatio is designated, as "obscene, indecent"]. As far as women are concerned, if they are born in this situation, they live an indecorous and undignified life or they take pleasure in sexual relationships with obscene and indecent men [Cf. Ptolemy, quadr. 4,5: «But if the aforesaid aspects chance not to be composed of signs of the same gender, but are in feminine places, thus they produce depraved individuals, ready in every way for both active and passive participation, and in some formations utterly obscene, as for instance in the forward and hinder parts of Aries, the Hyades, and the Pitcher, and the hind parts of Leo, and the face of Capricorn. But if the configuration is angular, on the first two angles, the eastern and mid-heaven, they make a complete display of their abnormalities and bring them forward even in the public places; on the last two, that is, the werstern and northern, they produce spades and eunuchs or sterile women and those without passages; if Mars is present, men who have lost their genitals, or the so-called tribades». With regard to the urn of Aquarius, kálpis, cf. the Latin version of the text by 'Al" ibn Ridwän: "Sunt quidem he figure principia leonis et arietis, necnon quod grece littere l vocatur, et hec est eius forma l cuius una stellarum aldebaran appellatur; est etiam illud quod grece vocatur calcas et est finis leonis, facies quoque capricorni inter easdem figuras numeratur". In this text calcas et est finis leonis do not denote the same asterism, but two distinct asterisms.]. Therefore, since the minds of these men and women are troubled and disturbed by unalterable, immutable motion of the stars they commit sins in their affairs and sexual relationships because of impetus and outburst of desire and lust and they treat themselves in all the ways, often unpleasantly, roughly and without respect and they often practise pleasures against nature. Then, if the star of Venus is in one of these enigmatic signs; Aries, Taurus, Leo and Capricornus, and it is watched by Mars or by Saturn when it is in the limbs or in the places of the signs that, as we explained before, excite and provoke passions, a person who is born in this situation is overwhelmed by the filthiest, the most shameless and indecent transports.

Whether it happens in a manifest, evident way or in a hidden one, is indicated by the rising or the occultation of the same stars that produce and cause affections and disorders of such a kind, I mean Venus and Mars or Venus and Saturn, especially when they are configured in an adverse, contrary way, by means of a quadrature or a diameter (opposition) or when one of them rises or culminates: in that case, in truth, the natives will reveal their passions in a public, generally-known, notorious way. Just as practising pleasures against nature can not subsist if the desire of passion and ineluctability of the destiny [Cf. Liber Hermetis (Gundel 96,20): "Oportet autem eos prius passionis desiderium adimplere necessitate fati".] do not come true and are fulfilled before, in the same way the sordid perception of the pleasure of desires makes some people subject to complications, to deceits and frauds, losses, enmities and hostilities, sentences and punishments, if the star of Jupiter does not keep away a part of harms and misfortunes testifying the star of Venus in some way.
If, on the contrary they are occulted by the Sun or occidental [ hypò krypsin toû hêlíou dytikoì óntes. The term Dytikoì means occidental (western) according to the Ptolemaic acceptation of this words that is occidental (western) with reference to the Sun. The same remark refers to the previous oriental (eastern), anatoliko', term which means oriental (eastern) with reference to the Sun cf. Bezza, 124ss.] especially the star of Venus, lewd and immodest actions are done secretly or under someone's protection and they remain unsuspected or arouse disbelief in people who get to know about it; they indicate, however, that women are 'tribades'(they practise unnatural vice with themselves or with other women) and they give themselves obscenely to men; and in truth, since these women are blinded by passion, their intellect is overwhelmed by desires and there is a uncontrollable lust inside them which makes their cravings boil and gives free play to their lecherousness. It is possible to understand and recognise such a force by means of the configuration of the stars and the relations between them. In fact, if Mars and Venus are matutine (morning) and are watched by malefic stars, they make people who are born in this situation vile, base and despicable as well as people who make ignominious, disgraceful things openly and impudently; these people often do not limit themselves to lustful and libidinous acts and sexual intercourse with men and women, but also with animals, quadrupeds or in a different way. If Venus is in the subterranean angle(the cardine under the earth) or in the occidens (the western angle) and it is watched by Mars or by Saturn or Mars itself is in setting degrees, especially in servile signs,as we have said before, they make the men effeminate, unmanly, flabby and not virile at all, the make the natives eunuchs, castrated men or people whose ducts are obstructed [Kroll: apokópous ; in the text: akópous.] or sterile people or they who abstain from venereal and sensual pleasures owing to a religious vow or because of superstitious fears and people who behave reprehensibly and blameworthy in lovemaking and in their sexual relationships.
On the degrees that produce and cause illnesses or else on the places that afflict the sight.
Many of our predecessors stated that the malefic stars, when they are opposite to the luminaries or in quadrature(square)to them or when they conjoin the luminaries(are conjunct to them) in degrees or in the signs which rise later, they harm the sight. This happens especially if in a nocturnal geniture Saturn watches the waning Moon in the abovementioned way or when Mars in a diurnal nativity is configured to the waxing Moon in such a way, both by corporal union and by opposition as well as by quadrature and also when while the malefic stars are angular the luminaries rise after them. Saturn will dim and darken



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY

the sight and make it cloudy by means of dampness or cataract or by cold, Mars by hits, blows, knocks etc. or wounds or by a sword, a dagger or by means of fire and it also causes blinding by means of burning, red-hot fluxes and if it is configured with Mercury and it watches the Sun or the Moon in the aforesaid way, it means that this event will take place in palestras, gymnasiums, on training grounds, during athletic exercises, during ambushes or as victims of a trap . [Cf. Ptolemy, quadr. III, 13: «And whenever Mars or Saturn moves toward the moon, when it is angular and waning and they are rising, or again when they ascend before the sun, being themselves angular. But if they are in the aspect with both the luminaries at once, either in the same sign or in opposition, as we said, morning stars with respect to the sun, and evening stars to the moon, they will affect both eyes; for Mars brings about blindness from a blow, a thrust, iron, or burning; when he has Mercury in aspect, in palaestras and gymnasiums or by felonious attack. Saturn causes it by suffusion, cold, glaucoma, and the like».]
Moreover, some of the ancients added certain remarks and comments that we confirm. In some places, among the limbs of the signs, there are nebulas, dense nebulosity, a multitude of small stars and thick, cloudy air almost dark, just as they appear to us as we observe them. When the Moon is in the node and especially when its light is waning or when it rises at the horoscope by these places and also when the Sun is in a similar position near these places, they damage and injure the eyes and they dim and darken the sight, even though there is not any testimony of the malevolent stars. These places are: the nubecula of Cancer, which is between the 11th and the 14th degree, the Pleiades of Taurus, from the 4th to the 6th degree, the arrow of Sagittarius, at about the seventh degree of Sagittarius, the nebulosa(nebula-star cluster)which is near the eye of Sagittarius that lies in the 28th degree of this sign, Scorpio's sting which is in the 30th degree of this sign, Leo's braids, the austral (southern) one at the 27th degree, the boreal (northern) one at the 30th degree of Virgo, the urn of Aquarius from the 17th to the 18th degree and the spine of Capricorn from the 25th to the 28th degree [Cf. Ptolemy, ibidem: «For blindness in one eye is brought about when the moon by itsel is upon the aforesaid angles, or is in conjunction, or is full, and when it is in another aspect that bears a relation to the sun, but applies to one of the star clusters in the zodiac, as for example to the cluster in Cancer, and to the Pleiades of Taurus, to the arrow point of Sagittarius, to the sing of Scorpio, to the parts of Leo around the Coma Berenices, or to the pitcher of Aquarius».]. If Saturn or Mars watch the Moon or the Sun that are in these places or even if one of them is in the degrees we have mentioned and it is angular and it moves towards the luminaries, especially if it in the place of setting or in the horoscope, the eyes of the person who is born in this situation will be damaged forever, if Jupiter or Venus do not observe the stars that produce the cause or the places or the decans, which we have expounded in the table and which are also included in the book by Hermes, in which many things concerning the iatromathematics are noted down. In fact, the malefic stars, placed in certain decans, send diseases, illnesses and infirmities peculiar to them and in those parts of the body which each decan rules, especially if in the nocturnal nativities Saturn rules over the place of the birth of illnesses and if Mars does the same in the diurnal nativities: in this way infirmities and illnesses reveal themselves and show their symptoms and the diseases become difficult to be treated and cured.



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 139 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
If the stars that send the diseases are towered above, dominated or irradiated by beneficent(benefic)stars, I mean Jupiter, Venus or Mercury, the diseases are curable and they are not stubborn or obstinate, but medium and easy to lighten and to be alleviated and sometimes they can be removed, especially if when one of the benefic stars is eastern, it watches the places that produce the cause. In particular, the star of Jupiter usually hides the infirmities and illnesses and relieves and alleviates the diseases thanks to richness or to human succour and assistance. If the star of Mercury observes the decans or the places we have mentioned in any way together with Jupiter, the illnesses and pains are removed or mitigated and alleviated owing to the doctors' succour and assistance and due to the suitability of medicines. If the star of Venus observes the causative places when it is morning, it works things in such a way that the infirmities and illnesses do not deform the body and it cures the diseases by means of divine intervention or oracular answers or thanks to amulets or expiatory sacrifice or by means of some vows or prayers. Finally, if only the star of Mercury watches the malevolent (malefic) star, which does not assent and yield to its own faction and is placed in a good position, it brings some help and succour to these diseases or even earnings or profit by virtue of these infirmities and illnesses [Cf. Ptolemy, ibid.: «Since this is the case, if no beneficent planet bears an aspect to the maleficient ones which furnish the cause, or to the luminaries on the centres, the injuries and diseases will be incurable and painful; so also if they bear an aspect but the maleficient planets are in power and overcome them. But if the beneficient planets are themselves in the authorative positions and overcome the maleficient planets that bear the responsibility for the evil, the the injuries are not disfiguring and do not entail reproach and the diseases are moderate and yield to treatment, and sometimes they may be easily cured, if the beneficent planets are rising. For Jupiter generally causes the injuries to be concealed by human aid through riches or honours, and the diseases to be mitigated; and in company with Mercury he brings this about by drugs and aid of good physicians. And Venus contrives that through pronouncements of the gods and oraclkes the blemishes shall be, i a way, comely and attractive, and that the diseases shall be readily moderated by divine healing; if however Saturn is by, the healing will be accompanied by exhibition and confession of the disease, and such like, but if Mercury is joined with her it will be with the accrual of use and gain, through the injuries and diseases themselves, to those that have them».]
In particular, if some signs and unwandering stars are in the degree of the place of gods or in the degree of the subterranean angle as well as when they rise at the horoscope, they render great assistance and help to a person who is born owing to a divine apparition or by means of dreams. Therefore, this help arrives when we see that Scorpio is placed in this position, especially the 27th degree wherein there is the bright star of Ophiuchus which cures the natives owing to an apparition or to the virtue of Asclepius or Serapides or owing to suitability and skill of excellent doctors [arístôn Rhet. adds.].Then, Spica set in Virgo at the 29th degree, heals owing to the apparition of mother of gods or of Core or of Aphrodite or of Igaeas [This one is the lection by Rhet. which is more complete and correct. The test says: dià Mêtròs theôn ê Kórês ê Aphrodítês hyghéias apoteléi.]. If the bright star set in the head of the preceding twin, which is in the 26th degree of Gemini, is, as we have said, seven degrees before [prò z moirôn. This condition is not included neither in EP nor in Rhet. Cumont believes that it has to be understood as: entòs heptà moirôn apò toû tópou. However, we can not exclude that the original forma of this condition was expressed this way: prò ê metà heptà hêmerôn, by analogy with the apparition and the occultation (eclipse) of a star, cf. Abenragel 33r; CCAG II, 190,26, V,3 88,12, VIII,1 240,10 (Rhetorius), VIII,4 208,13 (Rhetorius), Paulus Al. 76,3; Doroteus 1,27,24; 3,1,6.] the place of gods or the subterranean

angle or it rises at the horoscope, it brings the help of Hermes Telesforos or of Apollo. If we see that the bright star set in the head of the following twin, which is at the 29th degree of Gemini, is in the above-explained position, it brings the help and the apparition of Heracles, especially in the nocturnal genitures while in the diurnal it brings the aid and apparition [We find this specification only in EP.]of the Dioscuri. If the bright star of Canis (the Dog), which rises together with the 20th degree of Gemini is in the above-mentioned places, it gives, especially in the nocturnal genitures, the aid or the apparition of Hecate or of Ares itself or of Hanubis or by means of offerings and oblations or fire or blood or expiatory sacrifices. When the stars set in the horns of Capricorn, the Kids and the Goat, are in the above-mentioned places, they bring support or the apparitions of Pan or of Mercury, especially when a benefic planet watches the places we have mentioned. When they are in the places we made mention of all also the planets, in particular those planets which tend to do good things, bring about apparitions, succour and aid according to their own, characteristic nature and virtue. In the diurnal nativities Saturn brings about visions which are proper to it or the visions which come from Pluton and Poseidon and it bears aids thanks to the counteraction of plants peculiar to it and remedies from other substances. In a nocturnal geniture, placed in a good position [The text says: kakôs kéimenos; but I correct it in kalôs following Rhet. and EP.], Saturn brings visions that come from the dead, from the symptoms . [epistêmôn , Rhet.: episêmasiôn , EP: gynaikôn episêmôn.] or from the fear of gods. Finally, Mars brings <visions and aids> typical of its nature and disposition, favourable at night-time, dreadful and frightening, adverse, unfavourable and harmful in the day-time. [This one is the lection of EP, simile to Rhetorius' lection, in both phoberá, dreadful and frightening, is included in the qualities of the day.]

INTERPRETATIONS OF FIXED STARS IN MODERN TIMES
Richard Kiskiel says that the term Fixed Stars was developed thousands of years ago in order to differentiate between wandering bodies (the Planets) and stars that seem to stay in the same position. The term fixed is applied due to the fact that these stars are so far away that they seem not to move from their celestial position. Actually they advance at a rate of about one minute per year and thusly need more than fifty years to move even a full one degree. Some ancient teachings professed that these Fixed Stars had an influence of their own when conjunct (within 9 degres of) a planet Ascendant or Midheaven in your chart. Their influence was said to have less power when in opposition (across from), a planet etc. Here we are talking about teachings from about the year 150 A.D., all the qualities that these stars are said to have seem to be warnings of disaster, which enabled the High Priests to have power over people and Kings through fear.
Like everything else from the dark ages, we have evolved (somewhat?) and these and other Astrological terms need to be translated into the New Millenium age. A more psychological and humanistic reality. The maximum allowable distance from one of your chart points is only 1 degree in order for it to effect you. An example of this is to take the star Caput Algol at 25`Taurus 47" which is said to be baddest BADGUY. Some of its Astrological keywords are "The Evil One" bringer of violence, accidents to throat and neck, strangulation and beheading. Not too much beheading going on nowadays you say? Here is a milleniatized example of this stars effect on modern times.
A case study of a child born when Mars was 25`Taurus 10", or conjunct Caput Algol. While birthing, the umbilical cord was wrapped around the babies neck: todays modern medicine enabled the doctors to see this beforehand and by making the proper incision allowed this child to be born healthy and unharmed. In Ancient times this baby would have died of strangulation. So, the meanings given here have been unadulterated for the sake of handing down the wisdom of the past untouched.
He has given a list of important fixed stars with toned down meanings as appropriate for todays slightly less malevolent earth.

CASE STUDIES
A few points concerning the case studies are given below :
1. Seeing The natal chart in its totality: It would be impossible to interpret a chart with the fixed stars in isolation. At the outset it is to be stated that the general rules of reading a chart should be given the utmost importance, taking into consideration the elements, signs, houses, placement of planets, aspects, sahams, declinations, etc. After doing a thorough study, then only application of the rules of the fixed stars should be attempted.
2. Taking the significators into account: The countless artifacts, socifacts,mentifacts, etc., which are the creation of man and indictors and stamps of different civilizations, are signified by the signs of the zodiac, houses and planets. The interpretation of a natal charts becomes easier by using these significators. These significators have been used in the case studies of Lata Mangeskar, Neil Armstrong, Albert Einstein and Rigel.
3. Identifying the fixed stars on the angles, cusps and planets: The Elizabethan astrologer, William Lilly, identified about fifty fixed stars in his horary delineations. According to him the Fixed Stars have an influence when in conjunction, opposition, square or parallel aspect with a planet, or significant point in the horoscope. They are particularly important when in the Ascendant or Angles at birth, or when near the Sun or Moon. They also have an effect when directed to the Angles. Cusps and the Planets and can be activated by major transits.
4. Reinhold Ebertin says: “ practice shows that a star's high latitude does not appear to matter at all.” From my own experience, I wholeheartedly agree with this claim because research into events in history of the natives show that the fixed stars operate by longitude position, whether on the ecliptic or away from it.
5. Use of orbs for the fixed stars: So far as the orbs are concerned, Vivian Robson gives larger orbs of 5 degrees on either side for 1 magnitude stars but astrologers of recent times have restricted orbs to 1 degree. There is no hard and fast rule so far as orbs are concerned and even orbs of 2 1⁄2 degrees could be given to stars of 1 magnitude, moresoever when they fall on angles and the luminaries and the planets.
6. Effects of fixed stars to various angles and cusps: Dr. Randall C. Roffeo, in his “Introduction to Fixed Stars” says, “interpretations are done for conjunctions of planets (listed by house rulers), ascendant, midheaven, and other house cusps to over 60 major "fixed" stars and star clusters, all distant suns in their own systems. Called "fixed" because of their unchanging constellation patterns, against whose backdrop the planets move, these stars are the brightest stars we see at night. Bright stars generally not used for interpretation are those over 45 degrees north or south of the ecliptic path; and in "crowded" areas of the heavens, only the most powerful stars are selected for interpretation.

7. Great Men and the Power of the Subconscious: In one of the bestsellers at the turn of the twenty first century, “The Power of Your Subconscious Mind, Dr. Joseph Murphy and Dr. Ian McMahan state the following in Chapter One “The Treasure House Within You”: “Most of the great scientists, artists, poets, singers, writers and inventors have had a deep understanding of the workings of the conscious and the subconscious minds. It was this that gave them the power to accomplish their goals.” Prayer, is the constant interaction of the conscious and subconscious minds along with the superconscious linked to the Crown Chakra with infinite petals. As most of the present case studies are of achievers in various fields, their souls are advanced. Due to this constant interaction of the different sections of the mind, which is a storehouse of infinite treasures and miracles, these advanced souls are linked to the divine and metaphysics. We are told of a famous Egyptiologist who attempted to read the hieroglyphic carvings. After continuous study to decipher it, he got the answer in his dream through the interpretations given by a temple priest of those times. Many metaphysical descriptions of the fixed stars have been mentioned in the case studies and I feel that they are relevant to these great and advanced beings.
8. In some case studies, the description of fixed stars is given for academic purpose and may not be relevant in the true sense.
Many of these stars interpreted here form part of the familiar zodiacal constellations, and many of them are also our nearest neighbouring star systems, being in most cases less than one hundred light years away. Interpretation of fixed stars is the key to reconciling the tropical signs and the precession of the zodiac, thus understanding the relationship of astrology to the visible sky.The influences of stars correspond to their color, variability, brightness or magnitude, distance from us, and apparent distance north or south of the ecliptic path, as well as their traditional constellation myths. Generally, northern stars are more favorable than southern ones; and most white, blue/white, yellow and some orange stars are favorable, whereas most red or highly variable stars are considered potentially difficult. The most powerful stars are those nearest the ecliptic path, and the equator, the brightest, and those the closest to us. In a horoscope, the rising star (conjunct ascendant) and the culminating star (conjunct midheaven) are most important, as is any star conjunct the ascendant ruler.”
The following are the effects of fixed stars when they are conjunct to the angles or various cusps or their respective rulers:

9. The scope for research is very wide: As the study of the fixed stars is still very open, further research backed by case studies could be done and a balance judgement be obtained, which could be of help to the native with the sole view of suppressing the negative features and concentrating on developing the positive features and traits, so that the native could evolve to be a being of higher consciousness and even develop super-consciousness. This attempt could serve the noble purpose propogated by the early Aryan sages who used astrology as a way of



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 158 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
life with the sole aim of developing one’s life spiritually in this cosmic journey of life.
10. Brief biographical sketch of natives: Attempts have been made to give a brief biographical sketch of all the individuals so that the reader is aware of the native’s background and will be in a position to correlate interpretations to his/her life.
11. Interpreting the positive traits and action: It is rather easy to see the negative and degrading effects. As this study is solely aimed to portray “the good life” and to emphasize “Character is destiny” I have attempted to give only the positive results, so that readers and students will be motivated to change the lives of the masses by doing so. If negative qualities or events have been shown, then I feel that such incidents could be avoided by concentrated efforts and we could become better persons in the process of evolution in the cosmic journey.

- the melody queen and nightingale of the world.
“There's music in the sighing of a reed, There's music in all things, if men had ears, Their earth is but an echo of the spheres.” - Lord Byron
Lataji says her father told her mother that she is going to be a miracle since he knew a little about astrology though he died before she started singing.
Her first Playback was in a Marathi film in 1942 - Kitti Haasal. She acted in films till she was 15. Even small roles as extras, because she had to support her younger siblings. Her first song as a playback singer in hindi films was in 1947 - Aapki Sewa Mein. Accordig to Lata her first major break was in 1948-Majboor (Dil Mera Toda) given by Mst Ghulam Haider and then started an illustrious career. Then she never looked back. Till today, she has enchanted the audience at home and abroad and her name has spread far and wide, all over the world.
Mst Ghulam Haider who launched Lata's illustrious career prophesied "Let me foretell today that this girl will soon put to shade everyone else including Noor Jehan. Producers & singers will fall at her feet begging to sing in their films.”
These prophecies have all come true. Apart from hundreds of awards, trophies,etc. right from 1958, Lataji was honoured with the Bharat Ratna - The Nation's Highest Civilian Award in 2001.
Significators That Play An Important Part In The Life Of Lata Mangeskar:
As an actress, playback singer and composer in the entertainment industry, the following significators are important:
Actress : Fifth house, Pisces, Aquarius, Neptune, Taurus, Leo, Libra, ars, the Sun.
Singer and singing : Taurus, Venus, Uranus
Mimic : Mercury, Venus
Music : Taurus, Leo, Libra, 5th house, Venus, Moon and Neptune.
Cultural music : Neptune; electronic music:Uranus; martial and rock music:Mars; religious music –Jupiter; symphony, romantic music and composing:Venus; rhythm:Moon and Neptune



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY

In Lataji’s chart the significators of acting, singing, mimic and music Venus and its higher octave and lord of XIth are trine her ascendant. Further, Moon (in the sign of Leo, a sign which is also the significator of acting, entertainment and and art) the significator of Classical music is trine Saturn (in Saggitarus, the sign signifying religion), which gives great depth to songs. Rahu in Taurus, whose dispositor is Venus (both Taurus and Venus signify singing, dance, music, etc. is trine the 5th cusp, signifying singing, music and entertainment. Rahu is also in an intercepted sign of art, singing, music and creativity.
The significators do promise a career in the entertainment industry, especially singing, acting and composing. In this particular case, Rahu has a very special role to play, as it is in the natural second house, ruled by Venus (Venus is conjuct to its higher octave, that too in a sign of method and meticulous craftsmanship). The voice was hidden and could only be recognized by Mst.. Ghulam Haider, perhaps signifying Rahu, and to expose artistic qualities to the entertainment industry (Rahu trine 5th house). Rahu is trine 5th cusp and also Venus and Neptune (though not in the orb of 8 degrees). By using these significators as a background, it becomes easier to interpret a natal chart with the signs, houses, planets, aspects, fixed stars, etc.
The Effects Of The Fixed Stars In Her Life:
The Ascendant falls on Mirfak (1^ C 06`) (in the constellation of Ophiuchus, the Serpent Bearer)of the nature of Jupiter and Saturn, conjunct her ascendant, the native becomes intelligent, strong, bold and adventurous. Paul Diel states that the serpents entwine around the staff - symbolizing the Tree of Life - to show egotism tamed and brought under control, their venom transformed to healing, the corruption of the life force brought back to its proper channel. Health 'is right proportion, harmonization of desire (the serpents' symmetrical coils), control of emotional stimuli, the need for spiritualization and sublimation which not only rule the health of the soul, but determine the health of the body as well'. Such an interpretation would make the caduceus the especial symbol of psychosomatic balance.
The Nadir falls on Subra (23^E\15`) of the nature of Jupiter and Saturn, in the constellation of Omicron Leo, giving strength of mind and spirit and prosperity in trade and voyage (Robson).
The Descendant falls on Yed Prior (1^ I 19`) of the nature of Saturn and Venus in the constellation of Delta Ophiucus and of the nature of Saturn and Venus. This constellation has also been called Aesculapius and held to rule medicines. The native has been connected to the field of medicine as she has opened a hospital for the common man (VIIth house),
The Culmination falls on Castra (17^ K 57`), of the nature of Sturn and Jupiter, in the constellation of Epsilon Capriconus and of the nature of Jupiter and Saturn. The Babylonians kenw of this constellation by the name of Oannes, whose voice too, and language was articulate and human. He taught them to construct cities, to found temples, to compile laws and explained to them the principles of geometrical knowledge. He made them distinguish the seeds of the earth and showed them how to collect the fruits; in short he

instructed them in everything which could tend to soften manners and humanize their lives. He also gave them an insight into letters and sciences and arts of every kind.
The Cusps On Fixed Stars:
The IInd cusp falls on Betelguese (27^ C 45`) in the constellation of Alpha Orion. It is a star giving literary and inventivetalents and fame through writing. Indicates victory, success,achievement. Betelgeuse makes one brilliant and gives martial honor, power and wealth according to Robson. It brings success and fame. Lataji’s voice and speech (IInd cusp) has brought her name, fame, honour and wealth all over the world. Ebertin says that it gives everlasting fame. Larousse Encyclopedia of Astrology says that it is the harbinger of wealth. Manilus says that Orion will fashion alert minds and agile bodies, souls prompt to respond to duty's call, and hearts which press on with unflagging energy in spite of every trial.
The IIIrd cusp falls on Muscida (20^ D 00`) in the constellation of Omicron Ursa Major and
of the nature of Mars. Those born at the rising of this constellation will be tamers of wild beasts, that is men to teach bears, bulls and lions to lay aside their fierceness and share in human ways..
The VIth cusp is conjunct Spica (23^ G 15), Arcturus (24^ G 29.04`) and Nekka (23^ G15`)
Asthe planets Mercury (lord of ascednat, second house and fifth house- denoting the native, voice, speech, wealth, etc. is in fifth cusp but conjunct the sixth) and mars, conjunt the VIth cusp and Spica being a star of 1 magnitude, the conjunction could be taken for cusp and the planet. Spica is the gift to humanity and makes one an artist and singer with lasting preferment. Sixth cusp is earning or getting wages for services rendered. Lata Mangeskar started her career and earned money for the services rendered as a singer from the start. Sixth house also is competition, and she has been fortunate enough all throughout her long and illustrious career to get past her competitors very easily. Mercury is very well aspected by Jupiter from the ascendant, thereby increasing her fortune and saving her from thousand and one evils and dangers. Robson says that with Mercury, Spica gives neat, tidy, clever, ingenious, favor of clergy and people in authority, gain through investment, responsible position.
VIIIth cusp falls on Acumen (27^ I 46`) in the constellation of Scorpius and of the nature of Mars and Moon. Indicating a term for a sharp mind.
IXth cusp falls on Sulaphat (20^ J 56`) (the star of art and artistic ability) falling in the constellation of Gamma Lyra and of the nature of Venus and Mercury. According to Ptolemy Lyra (a musical instrument) is like Venus and Mercury. It is said to give an harmonious, poetical and developed nature, fond of music and apt in science and art.



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 164 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
The Luminaries on the fixed Stars :
The Sun is on Diadem (6^ G 34`), the star that gives her acting ability and talents.
The Moon falls on Subra (23^ E 15`) in the constellation of Omicron Leo and of the nature of Venus and Mercury. Hinduism has the lion as the fourth avatar of Vishnu and it represents Durga as destroyer of demons and is an attribute of Devi. The lion and lioness together depict the shakta-shakti. Hercules' battle with the Nemean Lion depicts the struggle to achieve it by overcoming the fiery passions of the heart. Having killed the lion, and triumphed over uncontrolled emotion, he can then wear the lion's skin which makes him king. The Lion is symbolic of devouring power and by extension the devourers of time.
Jupiter is on the star of Rigel (15^ C 50`) on the ascendant, which has combination of the nature of Jupiter and Mars. It is the brightest star in the Constellation Orion”s left toe. Orion will fashion alert minds and agile bodies, souls prompt to respond to duty's call, and hearts which press on with unflagging energy in spite of every trial. A son of Orion's will be worth a multitude and will seem to dwell in every quarter of the city; flying from door to door with the one word of morning greeting, he will enjoy the friendship of all. The rising position of Rigel shows early recognition, Rigel brings in knowledge, education and civilization. Through her melody and art, Lataji has always brought in such waves wherever she set her foot. Jupiter, on Rigel, expands and protects, while Mars energises to sustain the onslaught of competition and opponents. According to Ptolemy and Lilly, Rigel is of the nature of Jupiter and Saturn, but later authors consider it favorable and similar to Jupiter and Mars. Alvidas likens it to Mercury Mars and Jupiter. It gives benevolence, honor, riches, happiness, glory, renown and inventive or mechanical ability.
Another fortunate thing to note in the chart is that the Lord of Ascendant and Second cusp, Mercury is on the fixed star Spica (having the nature of Venus and Mars), considered to be the most fortunate star in the heavens. Seen as a wheat sheaf in the hands of the goddess, Spica was considered as her gift to humankind. Further, both the luminaries are in signs which signify art and artistic talents. The Sun is on Diadem, a star of artistic inclination and the Moon is in Leo, the sign of art and showmanship.
The III cusp is conjunct Pluto, on the star of Castor(19^ D 15`) in the constellation of Alpha Gemini and of the nature of Mercury. Ebertin says that “Castor is influenced by Mercury and has a blend of Jupiter in it. Linked with the Moon or Mercury, it has the effect of such people being blessed with a good nature and fine morals. It is also supposed to convey refined manners. A conjunction with the Sun or Mars will make for energetic characteristics and a certain tendency for satire and cynicism, depending on the position of Mercury or Mars in the chart as a whole.” Mercury is on a very fortunate star, more fortunate because it is the lord of the 1st and 2nd house, the native’s ego, personality, character, her voice, her speech, through which she is famous throughout the universe.
In August 1981, transit Pluto fell upon Spica. Pluto, originally on the star of publicity (castor) brought about a total change. All her rivals were eliminated and there was total

monopoly. In Sept. 1992, her progressed Nadir fell on Spica. It was a great turning point tin her life that her name started flourishing all over the world and many titles of honour were given to her from all corners of the world. Jupiter and Saturn are the prominent planets indicating the nature of her fixed stars on the angles. According to Saphariel’s planetary ages of man, all these good things started happening during the planetary periods of Jupiter (45 to 57) and Saturn (57 to 70). The present period is that of Uranus (70 to 84). Coincidentally, Uranus entered the sign of Aquarius on 12th Jan 1996 and was on her Xth cusp on 19th February 2000. As per the significators Aquarius and Uranus are also the significators of art, music, singing, etc. In the year 2001, during the planetary period of Uranus, the planet being in her Karmasthan (name, prestige, honour and renown) Lataji was given the highest national civilian award, The Bharat Ratna. In her natal chart, Uranus is in the XIth house, the house of fulfillment and success. Uranus is in the sign of Aries, the sign always on the move, the sign always reverbrating with life, the sign always modern. The lord of XIth (Neptune conjunct Venus iin the natal chart) is in Aquarius and the lord of Xth (Uranus) is in the sign of Pisces, forming a mutual reception (parivarthan yoga). Jupiter will in a very short time go to Libra on 25th September 2004 and form a trine to her natal ascendant and Uranus. We hope and pray that Lataji will be showered many more encomiums and laurels.
Spica is the symbol of knowledge and insights which are respected and hence it is not connected to any particular field or profession. Spica represents a gift of brilliance, a hidden or obvious talent, skill of ability out of the ordinary. It shows the potential for brilliance in whatever it touches in a chart. In this case, Mercury is the Lord of the Asc., IInd cusp and Vth cusp. The Ascendant is the native, the second cusp denotes voice, speech, wealth, etc. and the fifth cusp denotes creativity, enterprise, entertainment, etc. Ebertin clearly states that Spica in conjunction with Mercury and Venus, and positioned on the Meridian or Ascendant, gives artistic skills, ability to draw musical talents and a good sense for literature and the sciences.
Jupiter on Rigel generally gives success in early life, moresoever on the ascendant. Further Rigel rising and Betelgues in general gives lasting preferment, and Spica everlasting preferment. There has been great sacrifice on her part and discipline to make use of the good aspect of Jupiter to her ascendant lord and Mars and the 4 fixed stars that give name, fame, wealth and immortality in India and all over the world. The cosmic signature of Rigel on the ascendant, Betelguese on the second cusp, and Mercury on Spica and Arcturus near the sixth cusp has put the stamp of immortality on Lataji in the the field of singing, music and entertainment.

Gurudev Rabindranath Tagor
- A multi-facet gem with nobility
Born on May 7th 1861, Calcutta, India.
22^ N 32` 88^ E 22` Time Zone - 5hr 54min 28secs
Rabindranath Tagore, the Nobel laureate poet, writer, philosopher was the ambassador of Indian culture to the rest of the world. He is probably the most prominent figure in the cultural world of Indian subcontinent and the first Asian man to be awarded with Nobel prize. Even though he is mainly known as a poet, his multifaceted talent showered upon different branches of art, such as, novels, short stories, dramas, articles, essays, painting etc. And his songs, popularly known as Rabindrasangeet, have an eternal appeal and is permanently placed in the heart of the Bengalis. He was a social reformer, patriot and above all, a great humanitarian and philosopher. India and Bangladesh - the national anthems of these two countries are his composition.
During his stay in England he translated Gitanjali into English, with forewords by W.B. Yeats, an Irish poet, dramatist and prose writer, and one of the greatest English-language poets of the 20th century. Just one year after its publication (1912), he became the first Asiatic recipient of Nobel prize in literature. The British royalty honored him as a knight in 1915. However, quite conscientiously he relinquished his knighthood in 1919 as a protest against the massacre of Amritsar, where 400 Indians demonstrating against colonial laws were slaughtered by the English soldiers
After achieving worldwide fame, Rabindranath traveled and lectured extensively in Asia, Europe and America. Among the countries he traveled were: Bulgaria, Canada, Czechslovakia, Denmark, Egypt, Greece, Hungary, Iran, Iraq, Italy, Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway, Romania, Russia, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Thailand.
The Effect Of The Fixed Stars In The Chart Of Rabindranath Tagore
The Chart Of Gurudev Has Fixed Stars On All The Angles.
1. Ascendant on : Baten Kaitos (19^ A 37`) of the nature of Saturn, in the Constellation of Cetus (the Whale) indicating a charitable nature, ability to attract crowds, makes one prudent , happy; along with the saturnine qualities of solitude and simplicity are forced onto such people either by a mundane power or higher power.
Baten Kaitos (the star of commanding ability)in the constellation of Cetus, the Whale takes us back to the Belly of the whale myth of Jonah in the Bible is typical of the initiation rules of death and rebirth. In Mathew 12.40, Jesus said “For as Jonah was 3 days and 3 nights in the whale’s belly, so shall the Son of man be 3 days and 3 nights in the hearth of the earth. Several theologists believed that the whale that swallowed Jonah was the symbol of God the Father, who a hapless prophet was

thrown overboard, accepted Jonah into his own nature, until a place of safety was reached. The ‘great fish’ represents darkness of ignorance which engulfs man when he thrown over the side of the ship (birth) into the sea (life). This constellation also indicates pioneers, laws of benefit to the community, civil rights, animal rights, freedom from t he serfs.
2. The Xth cusp (known as the Karmasthan or Culmination) at 2^ J 03` falls on Kaus
Medius 2^ J 33` in the constellation of Delta Saggittarus of the nature of Mars and Mercury. This star conveys a sense of strength with flexibility, people who put force behind their reasoning and yet are flexible. Ebertin says that they are promoters of idealistic and humane ideas, promoters of mental stimuli, enterprise and a sense of justice.
3. The IVth cusp falls on Propus (1^ D 24`) and R.H. Allen says that this star givees life of eminence to those born under its influence. They can express ideas in reasonable and acceptable ways because of their manifest intelligence.
4. The VIIth cusp falls on Foramen (20^ G 47`) in the constellation of Carina and of the nature of Jupiter and Saturn giving strength of mind and spirit, dignity, piety and usefulness.
The Other Cusps :
IInd cusp falls on the following Three Stars:
Zaurak (21^ B 50.31`) of the nature of Saturn in the constellation of Eridanus named after the river god,the son of Oceans and Tethys, associated with many geographical rivers: the Nile, the Euphrates, the Po, the Rhone, the Ebro, the Huag He (Yellow River). The symbolism of rivers and running water is simultaneously that of Universal Potentiality and that of the fluidity of forms, of fertility, death and renewal. The river flowing and merging with the sea is attainment of Nirvana.
Capulus (22^ B 10.31`) of the nature of Mars and Mercury in the constellation of Perseus (the champion, the rescuer) giving an intelligent, strong, bold and adventurous nature. It is indicative of events affecting large number of people. The legend of Perseus is linked with David with the head of Goliath; whereas some say of it as Apostle Paul with his Sword and Book. Goliath is considered as a Philistine or barbarian. He was slain by David, the enlightened, who was good at playing the harp (music). If music is the food of the soul, then go on and give the best of it. Saul was considered to be one of the greatest persecutors of the early Christians. Through the divine cosmic power he was given wisdom and he later championed the cause of Christianity through his preaching and letter by the name Paul, the Lion of God. Gurudev wanted enlightenment, through education and music (Shantiniketan). His intelligence captured the masses not only in India but all over the world. The Swiss call India the Land of Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore.

Segin (23^ B 10.31`) of the nature of Saturn and Venus in the constellatiuon of Cassieopia. The Greeks at one time knew it as the ‘Laconian Key’, the key of invention. Cassiopia is also the Enthroned Queen. The throne symbolizes balance of the cosmos, achieved by complete integration of the opposites. It supports aspiration towards supreme knowledge through mastery of the cosmic energy. It symbolizes the culminating state of universal manifestation, bringing balance and harmony in its followers. It is remniscent of the Hindu and Buddhist symbol of the lotus that blossoms on the surface of the water. The throne is the epitome of the universe decorated with anornament which conjures the elements of the cosmos. Gurudev was blessed knowledge and wisdom and is an advanced soul and forerunner who propogated that true independence was the elimination of ignorance, superstition and elevation of the soul.
IIIrd cusp falls on the following 4 stars: Bellatrix the star of advancement and success) (19^
C 58.31`) the Orion star of the nature of Mars and Mercury indicating strength and dignity. Peeople with positive properties will lead themselves to advancement and success in writing and publishing.
Arnes (19^ C 18.37`) in the constellation of Lepus, of the nature of Saturn and Mercury. Lepus the hare had a geat reward for his sacrifice from Indira by a place in the Moon and the Moon is called ‘Sasanka’, “Marked with the Hare”. In Chinese the Hare represents the Yin lunar power for it mixes the elixir of immortality.
Capella (the star of literary and poetical ability) (19^ C 18.37`) the sixth largest star in the sky in the constellation of Auriga of the nature of Mars and Mercury, wwhich gives wealth, renown, public position of trust an eminent friends, very fond of knowledge and novelties.

This star confers interest in science, touch of genius and mediumship.
Al Hecka (22^ C 45.31`) is in the constellation of Zeta Taurus of the nature of Mars. In Indian astronomy the constellation of Taurus was represented by an elephant and alternately the bull – both having two horns or two tusks. At times the bull instead of being presented as an enemy is a friend who helps in crossing, the bull itself is identified with the hero and becomes the actor of the triumphant crossing.
The Luminaries on the fixed Stars:
The Sun on Rucha 15^ B 41.40` in the constellation of Cassiopeia and of the nature of Saturn and Venus giving the power of commanding respect.
The Moon on Alpherats 11^ A 39.31` in the constellation of Alpha Andromeda, bestowing purity of thought, virtue, honour and dignity upon the native.

The Xth house is the Karmasthan and Rahu is said to open the gates of destiny. It is placed in Capricorn, the sign of ambition, discipline, perserverance and organization. Rahu is on
Sheliak (17^ J 52.31`) in the constellation of Beta Lyra of the nature of Venus and Mercury. According to Ptolemy Lyra (musical instrument) gives poetical, harmonious and developed nature, fond of music and apt in science and art.
Further, Rahu falls on Sheliak (16^ J 58`) a star that favours arts. Rahu is trine to the Sun. Venus and Mercury, all in the sign of art and creativity. Rahu’s dispositor Saturn is also trine Mercury, lord of the third house, which also assists to give expression and form to shape.
Having so many fixed stars on the four angles, second and third cusps, the luminaries and other planets, and being from the house of culture, music, literature and social reforms, small wonder that Gurudev has made an impact on Indian culture and the literature of the world. As portrayed above his life is woven with mystery and astounding qualities that even the barbarians and philistines could not erase his works and he has left everlasting prints on the footprints of time that will outlast all the monuments of marbles, till the end of times.

NO : 3 ADOLF HITLER
- Today Germany is ours, tomorrow the whole world
Born Bernau Austria April 20 1889 18.14 local time 48N12 13E02 Time Zone -1
Hitler, Adolf (1889-1945), German political and military leader and one of the 20th century's most powerful dictators, murderer of millions, master of destruction and organized insanity, was seized by an obsession with the Jews all his life. The Nazi Führer had always been straightforward about his plans - his dream of a racially "pure" empire would tolerate no Jews. He announced at many occasions the “annihilation of the Jews” living in the territory under his control. In Hitler's mind, murdering millions of Jews could only be accomplished under the confusion of war - from the beginning he was planning a war that would engulf Europe.
At half past six on the evening of April 20th, 1889 an innocent child was born in the small town of Braunau Am Inn, Austria. The name of the child was Adolf Hitler. He was the son of a fifty-two-year-old Austrian Customs official Alois Hitler, and his third wife Klara, who became the founder and leader of the Nazi Party, Reich Chancellor and guiding spirit of the Third Reich from 1933 to 1945, Head of State and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Adolf Hitler was born in Braunau am Inn, Austria, on 20 April 1889. After spending four years in the Realschule in Linz, he left school at the age of sixteen with dreams of becoming a painter. In October 1907, the provincial, middle-class boy left home for Vienna, where he was to remain until 1913 leading a bohemian, vagabond existence. Embittered at his rejection by the Viennese Academy of Fine Arts, he was to spend "five years of misery and woe" in Vienna as he later recalled, adopting a view of life which changed very little in the ensuing years, shaped as it was by a pathological hatred of Jews and Marxists, liberalism and the cosmopolitan Habsburg monarchy.
Hitler surrounded himself with a small clique of fanatical, ruthless henchmen - a violent group of outsiders who rose to power in the Third Reich and established political and economic institutions of legitimized terror and murders, brutalities, cruelties, tortures, atrocities, and other inhuman acts were an everyday occurrence.
Hitler's dictatorial rule of Germany, which led to the deaths of millions in World War II, has placed him among history's most-hated villains. A decorated veteran of World War I, Adolf Hitler joined the German Workers' Party in 1919, later renaming it the National Socialist German Workers Party (shortened to Nazi). By 1921 he was the leader of the group, and in 1923 led an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the ruling German Weimar Republic. Sentenced to prison for his role, Hitler wrote his manifesto, Mein Kampf, and emerged less than a year later as a populist spokesman for economically depressed and nationalistic Germans. Made chancellor in 1933, he suspended the constitution, forcibly suppressed all political opposition and brought the Nazis to power. He enforced policies with a brutal secret police (the Gestapo) and formed concentration camps for the organized murder of Jews, Gypsies and political opponents. Hitler's aggressive foreign policy precipitated World War II in 1939.

In Germany concentration camps were set up after 1933 to detain without legal procedure Jews, Communists, Gypsies, homosexuals, and others. During World War II extermination, or death, camps were established for the sole purpose of killing men, women, and children. In the most notorious camps - Auschwitz, Treblinka, Sobibor and Majdanek in Poland, Buchenwald and Dachau in Germany - more than 6 million people, mostly Jews and Poles, were killed in gas chambers. Millions of others were also interned during the war, and a large proportion died of gross mistreatment, malnutrition, and disease.
The Holocaust represents 11 million lives that abruptly ended, the extermination of people not for who they were but for what they were. Groups such as handicaps, Gypsies, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, Catholics, Poles, Soviet prisoners of war, political dissidents and others were persecuted by the Nazis because of their religious/political beliefs, physical defects, or failure to fall into the Aryan ideal .
Although he had remarkable early success in the war, by 1942 the tide had turned against him. Hitler apparently committed suicide in an air-raid shelter in Berlin in 1945, after the Allied forces had invaded Germany.
The Interpretation Of Fixed Stars In The Chart Of Adolf Hitler
The Fixed Stars On The Four Angles:
I cusp (horizon) or Ascendant:
His ascendant falls on Spica in the constellation of Alpha Virgo of the nature of Venus and Mars according to Ptolemy and Mars, Jupiter and Mercury according to Alvida. With all the good qualities of Spica, Hitler cultivated the bad qualities like unscruplousness, unfaithfulness and injustice to innocence of this star. Many astrologers are of the opinion that had Hitler become the architect or painter he dreamed of becoming in Vienna, the world would have been saved from a holocaust. He had talents in this area and was at heart an artist. His artistic talents also appear to have led him to an exploration of the hidden powers of the occult while in Vienna he instituted the world’s first state operated by the use of satanic dark powers. Hitler discovered a powerful talent for oratory as well as giving the new Party its symbol — the Swastika.
Robson says that Spica also gives unexpected honour or advancement beyond the native’s hope or capacity.
IV Cusp (Nadir) fall on:
a) Geidi Prima (Algedi) 3^ K 12` in the constellation of Alphi1 Capronus of the nature of Venus and Mars.
b) Giedi Sesunda (2^ K 18`) in the constellation of Alph2 Capriconus of the nature of Venus and Mars.



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 174 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
Both these stars give beneficence, sacrifice and offering (Robson). The constellation of Capriconus is known as the House of Death and the Sun moves here in winter. The above qualities may be attributed to these stars because they signaled the beginning of a winter ritual. According to R.H. Allen, even in China it was intimately connected in religious worship with the rearing of the silk worm in the country.
c) Dabih (2^ K 30`) in the constellation of Beta Capriconus of the nature of Saturn and Venus, with a tendency to melancholy.
VII cusp falls on :
a) Al Pherg (25^ A 24`) in the constellation of Eta Pisces of the nature of Saturn and Jupiter, indicating success through determination (Noonan)
Preparedness, steadiness, determination and final success (Robson).
Pliny associated that the appearance of a comet here indicated great trouble from religious differences, besides war and pestilence.
b) Vertex (26^ A 16`) in the constellation of Andromeda of the nature of Mars and Moon, which causes blindness, injuries to the eyes, sickness and a violent death.
On the Xth cusp or culmination:
Al Tarf (2^ E 42`) in the constellation of Beta Cancer of the nature of the Moon and Mars.
Among the stars of Cancer is a small grouping called the Asses, who appear on the back of the crab’s shell. Hera had driven the god Dionysos insane, not particularly odd perhaps for the god who is discovers the vine. He roamed Egypt and Syria in his madness. It is said that he attempted to recover by going to Dodona to ask the oracle of Zeus what to do. As he came to a large swamp, he encountered two asses, captured them, and he rode them over the swamp without getting wet himself. Dionysos was then cured, and rewarded the asses by putting them in the heavens.
Hyginus also tells us that Dionysos gave one of the asses a human voice. Later this ass would be killed by Priapus, the son of Aphrodite by Hermes or Adonis, in an argument over the size of their penises. Priapus was a particularly ugly child and man with deformed limbs, and with a rather large male member. In pity for the dead ass, Dionysos put the ass in the skies with defiance. Wanting to show that he did so as a god, Dionysos placed the ass above the crab that Hera had put there.
Finally, Eratosthenes tells us that during that war between the Olympians and the Titanic giants, Dionysos, Hephaestus, and the Satyrs rode into battle on asses. Their braying and the confusion they caused made the giants flee. For these reasons, they were given a place in the heavens on the western side of the crab.



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 175 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
The ass was one of the most important symbols throughout history, not in ancient Greece and Rome, but in the Middle East among the Jews and others there, and even well into European history up through the Renaissance. In all likelihood, the asses were much more important than the crab; however, somehow that part of constellation has not carried forth into our time. The ass is both wisdom and stupidity; power and humility; demonic and beneficent; and it always has a lasciviousness, lubricity, and unmistakable phallic character. It is life and death (part of Hades is named after the ass). Moreover, it is a symbol of the turn of fate itself. Sadly, this wonderful creature no longer inhabits our imagination except when we call someone an ass or consider something asinine.
The Cancer convergence of cardinal and water traits—stubbornness, the desire for life to be exciting, the willfulness, possessiveness, unhurriedness, the gifted insight, the unpredictability, and even its opportunism, calculation, and self-centeredness—have never belonged to a crab at all, but the Ass so associated with Dionysos.
The question is whether Hitler was influenced by the dual nature of the constellation full of self-centredness, Or was it the influence of Saturn on the stars Acuben (Seretan) and Dubhe.
The Luminaries on the fixed Stars:
It should be noted that Hitler’s Sun falls on the cusp of Taurus, taking the traits of both Aries and Taurus. Many learned astrologers are of the opinion that such a Sun could give the native the character of a “bull in the chinashop”. They further say that when the Ascendant and luminaries are on the cusp of two signs (sandhis), such natives could go to extremes. Though the topic deals with fixed stars, care should be taken to incorporate other astrological factors in totality while delineating a chart. Fixed stars, which have been neglected to a great extent, are not the sole factors of interpretations in astrology. They are part and parcel of the diverse factors that leave an imprint on the native’s life and character.
1. a) The Sun conjunct Mira (29^ A 57`) in the constellation of Omicron Cetus of the nature of Mars and Saturn. Ebertin says that this star in unhelpful connections will bring as results failures, fiascoes, enemities especially with Saturn transits, or when linked with the Moon melancholy will appear. Linked with Mercury, which is close to the Sun (conjunct out of sign), in critical situations, suicide is indicated.
b) Sun on Mesarthim (1^ B 37`) in the constellation of Gama Aries, of the nature of Saturn and Mars. Ebertin says that this star makes one bold and a daredevil. Danger is indicated when acting impulsively and in a foolhardy manner.
2. The Moon (conjunct Jupiter) on Facies (the Bow of the Archer (6Cap44`) in the constellation of M22 Sagittarius, indicating defective sight, sickness, accidents and suicide. Some are of the opinion that this star has Jupiter and Mars connotations and gives enterprise and initiative in pursuits of ideals, which in Hitler’s chart seems to have been subverted into the Monomaniac pursuit of war. Coincidentally, the Progressed Moon came on Facies, the star giving warlike

tendencies (as in the case of Prime Minister of England, Margaret Thatcher, who was involved in the Falkland War) during the Second World War.
The luminaries signify the eye. Hitler was in danger of losing his eyes during the 1st world war.
The Other Planets On The Fixed Stars:
Neptune on Mirfak (0^ C 31`)
It gives an intelligent, strong, bold and adventurous nature, but a tendency to lying. By the Kabalists it is associated with the Hebrew letter Lamed and the 12th Tarot Trump "The Hanged Man". (Robson).
The constellation is indicative of events effecting large numbers of people, especially those events caused by major meteorological phenomena. When prominent in a natal chart it is said to denote adventurous individuals, but also those who are less than honest in their dealings with others. (Noonan).
General influence of the star: Sorrow, woe and distress. (Noonan).
Pluto on Prima Hyadum (4^ C 14`) in the constellation of Gamma Taurus, of the nature of Saturn and Mercury.
Pluto, (placed in the VIIIth House) the planet of transformation, change, total annihilation, is conjunct the Star group of Hyades, reputed to give phenomental sexual urges, dissolution, the striving after power where, if the energy is sublimated, high position can be obtained but the underlying reckless dissoluteness will then break through causing downfall.
Saturn in Xth (Kramasthan) on the stars of:
1. Acubens (Sertan) 12^ E 05` in the constellation of Alpha Cancer, of the nature of Saturn and Mercury. General influence of the star: Activity, malevolence and poison, making its natives liars and criminals. (Robson).
Acubens has a Martian nature and a strong blending in of Saturnian influence, conveying an unbalanced and "jumpy" nature. If the chart is a disharmonious one to people effected by it and especially if Acubens is in conjunction with Mars, Sun or Uranus, this will make for an unsettled mentality and helplessness. If in conjunction with Saturn, major disappointments in life, ordeals and trials, mental suffering, excitements, loss, opposition, disputes and deception are indicated. According to Elsbeth Ebertin's experience, this is the case especially if these persons are in positions of social standing or are politically active. (Ebertin).
One significance of Acubens is the enforced use of applied intelligence when finding oneself in combat at someone else's behest. But a generally more positive quality to read from Acubens is that of a sharp intellect and ease of coming to grips with problems, for which one might earn public renown. But, again there is the note of doing this under pressure of others demanding 'from behind'. (Dr. Eric Morse). This star has martian qualities with much of Saturn added. Linked to

Saturn it bring major disappointments, trials, mental stress, disputes and deception in the tenth house. It hints at a final downfall after a rise.
Dubhe in the constellation of Alpha Major, of the nature of Mercury and Venus. According to Ebertin it is credited with the destructiveness of Mars, working itself out particularly in mundane maps, in a nasty way if conjunct Saturn. Conjunct Hitler's Saturn, Mao Tse Tung's Moon.
Uranus (in the XII th house) on Foramen (20 G37`) in the constellation of Eta Carina, of the nature of Saturn and Jupiter. According to Robson it causes peril, dignity, piety, usefulness and acquisitiveness, and gives danger to the eyes. According to Prof. Gopal Modi, this is a degree of assassination.
The debate on Hitler has been going on and men and women from all disciplines in the corridors of time. Many feel that his upbringing, ill-treatment and circumstances were the cause as per the following line quoted from a biographer:
“As a child, Hitler had no witness. His father destroyed everything his son did. He could never tell anyone the pains he was suffering. In Sweden they made a play, “Hitler's Childhood,” from a chapter in my book. The story shows how that child looked for contact, longed for a glance, but was constantly treated like a dog. [...] Behind every act of violence there is a history. A history of being molested, a history of denying. The denial is a law governing us, but it is ignored by society and still not investigated by the professionals. Yet it holds the keys to our understanding why pure nonsense can be still held in high esteem in our culture, such nonsense as Sigmund Freud's idea that a child would invent traumas.”
With better treatment, love and understand from childhood, perhaps there could be Hitler with constructive ideas of taste and refinement. Viewing his chart in totality, many astrologers have pointed out that the Square aspect of Saturn ( on Seratan and Dubhe) and Mars, from the Culmination to the Descendant, his Moon on Facies, the opposition of Uranus (ascendant) and Mercury (descendant) and Pluto (in the VIIIth) on the Hyades was the cause of this evil and monster-like human being unleashing a reign of terror, treachery, horror, destruction and annihilation on the face of the earth. According to Prof. G.B. Forbes, there is a point of view that Hilter was indeed the second Anti–Christ.. He is perfectly right Hitler’s life history is an indicator that he preached, propogated and practiced all that was against compassion, love, peace and goodwill on earth. On the contrary he unleashed a reign of terror and horror and devastation in collaboration with the evil axis of Japan and Italy.

HIS EXCELLENCY’S MISSILE VISION ON “THE WINGS OF FIRE”
Professor APJ Abdul Kalam is the first Indian scientist to head the world's largest democracy as the 12th President of the Democratic Re]ublic of India. The 71-year-old southern Indian Muslim, widely known as "missile man", is acknowledged as the driving force behind India's quest for cutting-edge defence technologies.
His contributions to India's satellite programmes, guided and ballistic missiles project, nuclear weapons programme and the Light Combat Aircraft project have made him a household name.
Defence scientist
APJ Abdul Kalam was born on 15th October1931, at 11.30 a.m., into a middle-class family in Rameshwaram, a town well-known for its Hindu shrines. His father owned boats which he rented out to local fishermen, but he himself began his career as a newspaper vendor.
He then earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from a technology institute in Madras.
Professor Kalam joined the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre in the neighbouring state of Kerala in the 1960s as one of its first three engineers.
He played a major role in the centre's evolution to a key hub of space research in India, helping to develop the country's first indigenous satellite-launch vehicle.
The Indian media have attributed the development of India's advanced technology guided missiles to Professor Kalam's leadership.
Indian scientists have hailed him as the father of the Indian nuclear bomb and its missile delivery systems.
Professor APJ Abdul Kalam is widely known as "missile man" and is acknowledged as the driving force behind India's quest for cutting-edge defence technologies.
His contributions to India's satellite programmes, guided and ballistic missiles project, nuclear weapons programme and the Light Combat Aircraft project have made him a household name
Nationalist visionary
Professor Kalam played an important role in India's nuclear tests four years ago and was awarded the "Bharat Ratna", or the Jewel of India, the country's highest civilian award.
Another of his major defence projects, the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA), designed to replace expensive foreign fighter aircraft with a locally-built fighter, is moving slowly out of the design boards.

After resigning as the Indian Government's Principal Scientific Advisor last year, Dr Kalam has been spending his time quietly as emeritus professor at the Anna University in his home state of Tamil Nadu.
A vegetarian bachelor, Professor Kalam was quoted as saying that like most of the technology he spearheaded, he himself was "Made in India", having never been trained abroad.
Effects Of Fixed Stars In The Chart Of President APJ Abdul Kalam
Fixed Stars on the angles:
1. The Ascendedent (horizon) falls on Facies, (7^ J 20`) in the constellation of : M22 Sagittarius. It is of the nature of the Sun and Mars. On the more philosophical side it will mark those who must see their outlook and beliefs carried into practical effect somewhere, so that they go out on missions, set up their own centers, engage in good works of famine or refugee relief and so on. Dr. Eric Morse says that inevitably they get hurt at times, but perhaps find compensation in the value of their works. The positive side of Facies shows adventure and exploration. Some are of the opinion that this star has Jupiter and Mars connotations and gives enterprise and initiative in pursuits of ideals.
2. The IVth cusp falls on Alpheratz (13^ A 21`), in the constellation of Alpha Andromeda, , of the nature of Jupiter and Venus. Nearly every inventor and "famous first" has a connection to this star and Alpheratz was activated when many worthwhile inventions were patented or brought to public attention. According to Ptolemy it is of the nature of Jupiter and Venus, and to these Alvidas adds Mars also. It gives independence, freedom, love, riches, honor and a keen intellect. Harmonious nature which makes for popularity. If it is in affinity to propitious stellar bodies and with the personal points MC, Asc, Sun, Moon, one can count on becoming well known in public and popularity with the masses.
3. The VIIth cusp falls on Alhena(8^ D 08`), the star of scientific interest and development and military and sports in the constellation of Gamma Gemini, of the nature of Mercury and Venus. Robson says that it bestows emminence in art, but gives liability to accidents affecting the feet.. Artistic skills, especially with the written or spoken word and ability to negotiate a peaceful settlement in disputes. According to Ebertin, Alhena is supposed to have a Venus nature with a Jupiterian influence. This will confer a spiritual orientation on people thus effected and also give an artistic inclination, with interest in the sciences.
4. The Xth cusp falls on Al Gorab (12^ G 30`)in the constellation of Delta Covrus, of the nature of Mars and Saturn. It is a star in the 12th Hindu nakshatra, Hasta, the Hand, with Savitar, the Sun, as its presiding divinity, for sales, art, sculpture, learning, medicine, etc.

All the four angles have cardinal signs, with Capricorn rising making him ambitious. With Facies rising, instead of having a nortious Hitler or an aggressive Margret Thatcher, here we have his excellency, with great and penetrating vision of being prepared with the latest and most lethal modern weapons and equipments to counter all attacks that are aimed at the destruction of our rich cultural hereitage. The darkest shadow of Facies is war, but if balanced, can imply an achieving person, with great forcefulness to the sense of identity.
Other cusps on fixed stars
Vth cusp on a) Zibal (12^ B 52`) in the constellation or Eridanus and of the nature of Saturn. It gives interest in the study of science and position of authority.
Almanch(13^ B 02`) in the constellation of Andromeda and of the nature of Venus. According to Robson it gives honor, eminence and artistic ability. According to Noonan it gives honors in military endeavours.
c)Menkar (13^ B 21`) in the constellation of Alpha Cetua and of the nature of Saturn. According to Ptolemy this constellation is like Saturn. It is said to cause laziness and idleness, but to confer an emotional and charitable nature, with the ability to command, especially in war. Ebertin says that this star has a Saturnine character, corresponding to impediments of many kinds, worries and tests of endurance. Unjustified enmities, hardening and toughening these people in some ways. In some cases with conjunction of Saturn, Mars or Neptune, diseases of the throat, inflammation of larynx, sometimes danger by suffocation have been noted. These people are advised to take good care of themselves if they have a tendency to throat trouble and to take prophylactic measures. They should avoid overstraining their larynx and should they have special demands regarding the larynx, they are advised to take trouble in the methodical training of their vocal chords etc.
VIIIth cusp falls on Asselus Borealis (7^ D 35`) which gives high public office and honours through public position. The owner of the VIIIth cusp is the Sun placed in the karmastahn in Libra. The President of India holds the highest office in the country and is the supreme commander of the defence forces.
The Luminaries On The Fixed Stars.
The Sun in the Karmasthan on Heze (21^ G 25`) in the constellation of Zeta Virgo and of the nature of Mercury and Venus. In Ancient Egypt, Virgo was the sign of Isis. As the sixth sign of the Zodiac it shares the symbolism of the number six and of the Star of David. It pertains simultaneously to Fire and Water and symbolizes consciousness emerging from confusion, as well as the birth of the spirit.
The Moon conjunct the XIIth cusp on the star of Rastaban (11^ I 00`) in the constellation of Numki (Pelagus) and of the nature of Jupiter and Mercury. A star in the vane of the Arrow on the Archer's hand in Sagittarius. This has been identified with Nunki of the Euphratean Tablet of the Thirty Stars, "the Star of the Proclamation of the Sea", or the

"Voice from the Sea" [indicating direction, guidance, instruction], and portended favorable events for mariners and shipping. According to Ptolemy it is of the nature of Jupiter and Mercury; and, to Alvidas, of Saturn and Mercury. It gives truthfulness, optimism and a religious mind. (Robson).
Planets On The Fixed Stars:
1. Saturn on Sabik (17 ^ I 00`) in the constellation of Eta Ophicius and of the nature of Saturn and Venus. When Ophiuchus, encircled by the serpent's great coils, rises he renders the forms of snakes innocuous to those born under him. They will receive snakes into the folds of their flowing robes, and will exchange kisses with these poisonous monsters and suffer no harm. (Manilus, book 5 of Astronomica, 1st century AD).
2. Pluto on Pollux(22^ D 16`)in the constellation of Beta Gemini and of the nature of Mars. According to Ptolemy it is of the nature of Mars; and, to Alvidas, of the Moon, Mars and Uranus. Robson says that it gives a subtle, crafty, spirited, brave, audacious nature, a love of boxing, dignified malevolence, and is connected with poisons Ebertin says that just as Mars has its good sides if the energy it creates is channeled constructively, so Pollux should not always be considered as unhelpful. The star badly placed could manifest that way, not by the native misusing his energy but by others deceiving him and fate playing him some cruel tricks. Helper if in peril on voyages at sea. Pluto signifies transformation and being in trine with Mars in the XIth and Mars’s despositor being Pluto in the VIIth, he has transformed the face of the country with his very forceful nature and untiring efforts in an atmosphere of strife and struggle to achieve success in a field that is rather full of secrets.
3. Jupiter on Merak (18 ^ E 08`) of the nature of Saturn and Mars and Taina Borealis
(18^ E 35) of the nature of Saturn and Mars, both in the constellation of Lamba Usra Major. Ebertin says that both these stars have a Mars nature and is of importance in a natal chart, if the sign Leo is tenanted and other configurations give a clue to love of command and domination. Jupiter, whose despositor, the Sun, in the Xth house, on these stars is in a position to grant command and domination to highest level. The President is the supreme commander of all the wings of defence in the country. He is the first citizen of the country.
4. Neptune on Alioth (7^ F 56`) is in the constellation of Epsilon Ursa Major and of the nature of nature of Saturn and Venus and according to Ebertin it amalgamated with possible non propitious planets, it will indicate fiascoes, bad fortunes within the family circle or within the profession or disappointments brought about by friends.
5. Venus is on Maplacidius (1^ H 03`) in the constellation of Beta Carina and of the nature of Jupiter and Saturn, giving strength of mind and spirit.

6. Mars is on Unukalhai (North Scale) (20^ H 06`) in the constellation of Alpha Serpens and of the nature of Mars and Saturn. In the Neck of the Serpent, Unukalhai shows its properties as a Martian force combined with Saturn. Dr. Eric Morse says that the neck, rather than the head, is where a snake has its brain, its seat of knowledge. So this star is all about that knowledge that the good doctor has won from his labors, that knowledge of where we came from, what we are, where we are going, what holds us back, what to do about healing it. (he is referring to this star's position in the constellations Serpens and Ophiuchus, which are related to medicine and healing). This Saturn-Mars star will have only good fortune to those who give service, in healing or teaching. Ebertin says that the Northern Scales has a JupiterMercury nature and therefore positive properties. Tied up with the MC and Ascendant or with well placed stellar bodies, the Northern Scales are credited with helping the native to gain honors and distinction. When connected with Mercury they are supposed to make the native studious. In good position, the star will arouse, above all things, spiritual and mental forces. The conjunction with Sun, Moon, or Jupiter favors civil servants, lawyers and scientists. Confiscation of possessions during times of war. Credited with bestowing an immortal name.
The IVth cusp denotes later life. The star Alpheratx on the VIth cusp gives the pioneer of Indian defence force preferments and favours from one and all, a popular figure with immense knowledge of human nature. The lord of the VIth cusp is in the XIth on the star of North Scale, a star favouring scientists with position and immortal name. The VIIth cusp falling of Al hena gives liking for science and military. His Excellency is the supreme commander of the 3 wings of defence and has increased the potentials of the defence forces through his hard work and endeavours. .

Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar
“the master-blaster following the legacy of the great West Indian Vivian Richards. The name itself strikes terror in the hearts of bowlers all around the world. He stuns the world with the whack of willow and his spin at times makes one and all to count stars even in daylight.”
Born :- 24 April, 1973 at 16.21 IST, Mumbai(Bombay), India
Height : 5'4"
Major Teams : India, Yorkshire, Bombay
Batting Style : Right Hand Bat
Bowling Style : Right Arm Medium, Leg Break, Right Arm Off Break
Ambition : To be number one in the world
Memorable Day : Beating Pakistan in the 1992 World Cup
Greatest Influence : My family
Current Players Admired : Vinod Kambli, Brian Lara, Jonty Rhodes
Heroes : Gavaskar, Viv Richards, Imran Khan, Sandeep Patil
Favourite Ground : Sydney Cricket Ground
Other Sports Followed : Tennis in particular
A child prodigy, he made his international debut in ODIs and Tests at the age of 16 against Pakistan and the fiery pace of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis . He then went to England as a part of the national side, and has not looked back ever since. In batting, he has reached a stage that others can only dream of. He has destroyed practically every bowling opposition in the world - from Shane Warne (Aus.) to Saqlain Mushtaq (Pak.) , and Waqar Younis (Pak.) to Allan Donald (RSA), and in style. Tendulkar 'specialites' include the straight drive (seemingly nobody plays the shot better than him ), the cover drive, the square cut, the pullshot over midwicket/square leg, the delicate leg glance, the late cut, the lofted shots over mid-on and mid-off and not to mention the improvisations he keeps coming up with time and again. He plays each of his shots amazingly well and has even employed the reverse sweep to good effect. A short but powerful man, some of his shots are hit with so much power that the ball simply rockets to the fence as if he was trying to dismiss the ball from his presence. On the other hand, some of his shots are simply timed and placed well. His timing can be quite exquisite and it is this blend of timing and raw power that puts him in the top league with Brian Lara (W.I.) ,Waugh Twins(Mark and Steve, Aus.) and Aravinda de Silva(Sri Lanka).
There is nothing this man cannot do - he opens the batting for India in the one-dayers, comes at no. 4 in test matches, bowls rightarm offbreaks, legbreaks and even googlies. He also swings the ball both ways when he bowls his medium pacers. It seems he had tried his hands at wicket-keeping too (in his school days), but gave it up in pursuit of what he does best Batting.

His selfless approach and devotion to cricket coupled with the lack of any ego problems makes him one of the most approachable and likeable personalities on the cricket field. No wonder he commands a huge fan following all over the world. He is a great thinker of the game and a good strategist too.It was his great cricketing mind that saw him being appointed as the captain of the Indian side in 1996-97 making him the second youngest captain in the history of Indian cricket (the youngest being M.A.K. Pataudi who was appointed captain at the age of 21). He initially justified the faith put in him by leading India to series victories against Australia (Border - Gavaskar Trophy), South Africa (at home) and also lifted the TITAN cup (Triangular tournament featuring India, Australia & South Africa). But after that, the performances dropped. He was not given the squad that he wanted and India started losing under an unhappy captain. As usual, the skipper was made the scape-goat and citing his lack of form (he had scored more than a thousand runs in both ODIs and Tests in 1997 a record) was removed from captaincy. Since then, he has flourished with both the bat and the ball, and is thus back to his true self and the job he loves the most - winning matches for India.
With age on his side, he is set out to be the highest run getter in the history of world cricket. He has already won rich praises from people and fellow/former cricketers who see in him a living legend and a master batsman who is leagues above his fellow cricketers. Truly, a living legend and a great champion.

On 16th March 2005, he joined the Club 10,000 along with Allan Border and Steve Waugh of Australia, Sunil Gavaskar of India and Brian Lara of the West Indies. On 12th April 2005, he scored his 38th Century in ODI at Ahmedabad.
Military and Sports :
Before discussing the case study of Sachin Tendulkar, it should be seen whether military and sports go together in interpretation, as most of the fixed stars are the same. A cricketer and an army man should have strength of mind and spirt, be adventurous, aggressive, enthusiastic, a fiit athlete, be ready in times of crises, have determination, be ambitious and bold. Since there is much expectation from sportsmen including cricketers, they have to be super fit and with great skills, overcome ftigue and jet lag. At times sports, especially oneday cricket needs perfect health and injuries at times can put a person out of action even for life (like Nari Contractor, Jhonty Rhodes, etc.). The tenure of service is short in both the cases and during that period they have to have enough energy to over exert themselves and be calm in times of crises. In both the cases they bring honour and glory to themselves and the nation. Hence there is a lot of justification in using the same fixed stars for sports in modern times , which were used exclusively, from time immemorial, only to signify the prowess of the defence force. It is also interesting to know that the rigorous training given to the best cricket team of recent times (ie., the Australian cricket team) is known as “the iron drill”.
Fixed star in the birth chart of Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar
Fixed stars on the angles
1. The ascendant or the first cusp on Markeb(28^ F 36`) ( the star giving strength of mind and spirt), in the constellation of Kappa in Vela of the Ship Argo Navis and of the nature of Saturn and Jupiter. According to Robson the constellation gives prosperity in trade and voyages. Strength of mind and spirit. It gives piety, a wide knowledge, educational work and voyages. Robson further says that if rising, it gives profitable journeys in company with Jupiterian and Saturnian people wherein the native is grave and discreet, but suffers much injury, which ultimately turns to good.
2. Nadir or IVth cusp on Acumen (28^ I 23`) in the constellation of M7 Scorpius and of the nature of Mars and the Moon. Dr. Eric Morse says that this star along with Acules has a notorious reputation in astrology as 'blind stars' or stars associated with eyesight problems. These stars shows up a negative Mars-Moon quality in people who have them poorly aspected, with a tendency towards a morbid outlook, seeing the worst rather than the best in everything.
He further says that but at their best, well aspected, they can have very sharp minds and a perception well above average as though, perhaps 'blind' to what we see and take for granted, they see what we do not, at levels where eyesight does not reach. Not for nothing has the word Acumen come down to us as a term for a sharp mind. ACUMEN is a Latin word meaning mental acute-ness as well as a

point and a sting. The root is ak, signifying sharpness. Hebrew HAKH'MA means intelligence and skill, a word of mental acuity with many sharp branches. One of the greatest assets of a cricketer is his eyesight. His superior eyesight helps him play aggressively to bowling of even 100 m.p.h.
I am given to understand that the Great Master Blaster, Sir Vivian Richards used to take care of his eyes and wash them daily with a special lotion. It is just like a sharp shooter hitting the bull’s eye with power-packed strokes.
3. The VIIth cusp falls on on Scheat (the star of ambition) (28^ L 00`) in the constellation of Beta Pegasus and of the nature of Mars and Mercury. Ebertin says that tied up with 'malefics', this could lead the native to lose his life in catastrophes, such as floods, shipwreck, mining accidents, airplane accidents, or maybe suicide. On the other hand, it is possible for a positive influence to emanate from Scheat, but only for some people, it can have a positive effect on their mental creativity, if these people are ready to receive such inflow of positive vibrations.
A cricketer should also be creative and correct himself of his mistakes. The great legend of Indian cricket, Sunil Gavaskar used to watch video tapes of his batting at an exclusive time and find out how he went wrong and correct his action. Mental creativity also needs great presence of mind. We are given to understand that Sachin Tendulkar too spares time for such an activity. That is how his strokes are fluent and his spin bowling stunning.
4. The Xth cusp or Karmasthan on 3 stars : Wazm (28^ C 03`), in the constellation
of Beta Columbia, of the nature of Mercury and Venus; Polaris (28^ C 12`) in the constellation of Ursa Major and of the nature of Saturn and Venus;
b)Betelguese Culminating is The Star Of Military And Sports.Betelguese (28^
C 23`) in the constellation of Alpha Orian and of the nature of Mars and Mercury. Betelguese is a star that makes him a skilled, cautious, organized and able leader. It is a star that makes a superior athlete being endowed with outstanding agility and speed of the body.
Wazm in the constellation of Beta Columbia gives a gentle, kind, timid, innocent and self-sacrificing nature, together with strength of spirit. Bringers of good news accoring to Robson.
Polaris in the constellation of Ursa Major in the angles according to Ebertin serves as a guide and indicator. If it is conjunct with planets in the angles, the native will have a good sense of discretion and is able to follow 'his intellect'. He clearly recognizes his aims and will pursue and achieve them.
Betelguese in an Orian star(the star of sports and military) at the culmination and according to Robson it gives great military fortune, command, invention, ingenuity and helps in the perfection of arts and sciences. The constellation of Orion will fashion alert minds and agile bodies, souls prompt to respond to duty's call, and hearts which press on with unflagging energy in spite of every trial.

Placed in the angles, preferment, luck, success and everlasting fame are promised. If at the same time with Sun, Moon or Jupiter, ample fortune and great honor. According to Noonan it gives the power of a superior athlete, being endowed with outstanding agility and speed of body. Variable moods and the mind always anxious with the immediate problems of the day. Honors and titles. Ebertin says that it gives everlasting fame. Larousse Encyclopedia of Astrology: Said to be a harbinger of wealth.
Considering the chart degreecally, the four angles form a grand cross where the quality of Mars being vibrated by the stars of the angles influence him. These stars promise strength of the mind and alertness, unflagging energy to face everyday trails. For a world class cricketer every day is a test and trial requiring a lot of physical energy and an alert mind. Virgo, his ascendant, shows meticulous craftsmanship, and its lord Mercury in the sign of Aries shows enterprise, dynamism and always keen on moving forward. The despositor of Mercury is in the Vth house (the house of sports and entertainment) along with Jupiter, making a grand trine with Uranus (indicating flashes of great intuition and genius) on the ascendant and Saturn (caution and intelligence) in the IXth house. Combining the aspectual influence of the planets in different signs and the powerful fixed stars on the angles, Sachin Tendulkar the uno numero in the world of cricket, the record breaker, is destined to get honour, fame and wealth showered throughout his life. Further, there is reference to creativity, mental activity, etc., indicating that he could be a future guide, coach, teacher, columnist or commentator in the world of cricket and related fields.

The XIIth cusp falls on Regulas(the star of sports, military and adventure) (29^ E 28`) in the constellation of Cor Leonis and of the nature of Mars and Jupiter. According to Robson it makes its natives magnanimous, grandly liberal, generous, ambitious, fond of power, desirous of command, high-spirited, energetic and independent. The importance of this star is accentuated by its nearness to the ecliptic. Its effect is in the best sense that of Jupiter and Mars. Since it is on the XIIth cusp relating to loss, expenditure, self undoing, the native should be careful in this respect. The XIIth cusp shows investment too. Perhaps this could help him in investments made in insurance and pension schemes, etc.,since the Lord of the XIIth is in the VIIIth, almost trine to it, that too in the down to earth sign Taurus.
The Luminaries On The Fixed Stars
1. The Sun on Sheretan (3^ B 37`) (the star of aggressiveness, ferocity and great risk) in the constellation of Beta Aries, of the nature of Saturn and Mars. According to Ebertin daredevils and bold, danger is indicated when acting impulsively and in a foolhardy way. Dre. Eric Morse says that about 300 years ago this star was in Aries and had very aggressive power but after coming to Taurus, the barbaric aggressive tendency has been coloured by the practical down to earth mentality of Taurus, that is powerful determination to achieve, typical of the Taurus and Mars-Saturn Comination.
2. The Moon on Dhenib (19^ J 26`) (the star that gives passion, will and a penetrating mind for one’s avocation) in the constellation of Zeta Aquila and of the nature of Mars and Jupiter. According to Robson it is said to give great imagination, strong passions, indomitable will, a dominating character, and influence over others, clairvoyance, a keen penetrating mind and ability for chemical research. Noonan says that it gives success in martial arts (or sports).
Considering the signs in which the luminaries are placed, they again show determination and practical application of the soul and the mind towards ambition to achieve with determination.
Other Planets On The Fixed Star

Jupiter and Mars, who are also important for success and vitality are trine the lord of the 5th (sports) Saturn. Saturn is also trine Uranus, the lord of the sixth (competition). This Grand trine from Libra Uranus), Aquarius (Jupiter and Mras) and Gemini (Saturn) intellectual and refined use of force, creativity, talents and personal enterprise and success.
Man changes his attitude according to circumstances and all the good and evil qualities show their colour from time to time. The aim of astrology from times immemorial was to know everything, suppress the evil traits and forcefully cultivate the good qualities that would make a person civilized and successful.
Venus falls on Hamal (7 ^ B 29`) a star that gives determination, tact and grace.
Rahu falls on Nunki (20 ^ J 37`). As Rahu is in Capricorn, it has influence over the 5th house that rules sport and entertainment, as Saturn is the dispositor of Rahu. As Saturn in the native’s chart gives all the traits of an athlete, so Rahu too has a great role to play. The star Nunki makes a person bold, truthful, straightforward, courageous, practical and selfcentred. All these qualities are essential for a cricketer and in aspect, the Sun (life giver) in the sign of practicality, determination for results is trine Rahu.
`This star cricketer has Regulus (a geat star of military and sports) on the XIIth cusp, giving him public honour and great credit in distant lands and Betelgues (also an Orion star of military and sports) giving him everlasting fame.

The Effects Of Fixed Stars In The Chart Of Elizabeth Rosemond Taylor:
It is said that fixed stars do not cast any rays. They influence cusps and planets in conjunction , opposition and by parallel of declination. In the case of Elizabeth Taylor there are a few instances where these fixed stars influence the cusps and planets through opposition so far as art and acting abilities are concerned.
Fixed Stars On The Angles:
1. On the Ascendant is a Royal Star Antares (8^ i 49`) in the constellation of in the constellation of Alpha Scorpius and of the nature of Mars and Jupiter. The ascendant is also influenced by the opposite fixed stars of the descendant (ie, Aldebaren and Ain) to acquire artistic abilities. This is one of the four key stars in the heavens, also called archangel star, Oriel (Antares) Watcher of the West. Antares was the "Fire Star" in China, Who Sing. It seems to have been invoked in worship centuries before our era for protection against fire. Indian astrology used alpha (Antares), sigma, and tau for their 18th nakshatra Jyestha, "Oldest", Indra, the sky-god, being regent of the asterism that was figured as a pendent Ear Jewel.
Robson says that it causes malevolence, destructiveness, liberality, broadmindedness, evil presages and danger of fatality and makes its natives rash, ravenous, headstrong and destructive to themselves by their own obstinacy. This is



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 196 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
an important star for military personnel and is said to convey mental alertness, strategic ability and courage and to make dare-devils, especially if tied up with the MC, Ascendant, Sun or Jupiter. If rising: Riches and honor, violence, sickness, benefits seldom last. Ebertin says that it is of Mars nature, in which the powers of Mercury and Jupiter and Saturn are also added. Antares makes people tough, belligerent and pugnacious. This is an important star for military personnel and is said to convey mental alertness, strategic ability and courage and to make daredevils, especially if tied up with the MC, Ascendant, Sun or Jupiter. Bernadette Brady states that people with Antares prominent may well cause their own undoing they may have to conquer themselves first before they can make a contribution to others.
2. The IVth cusp Algenib (5^ A 12`) in the constellation of Gama Pegasus and of the nature of Mars and Mercury. Ebertin says that it gives a penetrating mind and a strong will, as well as determination. An impressive way of speaking and a gift for oratory. If angular with Mercury and Uranus, Algenib will make for an inventive spirit.
3. The VIIth cusp on Aldabaren (8^ C 41`)(the star giving honour through art and artistic abilities) in the constellation of Occulus Tauri and of the nature of Mars. Ptolemy gives Aldebaran the nature of Mars, although there clearly seems to be a large dose of Jupiter present. Vivian Robson, in his classic Fixed Stars and Constellations in Astrology, says this about Aldebaran's influence: “It gives honor, intelligence, eloquence, ferocity, a tendency to sedition, a responsible position, public honors and gain of power and wealth through others, but its benefits seldom prove lasting and there is also danger of violence and sickness.” Bernadette Brady says that looked at basic myths related to Aldebaran and concluded that one could succeed while overcoming challenges to one’s integrity. In Indian astrology Rohini, used for this star and for this 4th nakshatra; "A Red Deer" known also as the "The Star of Ascent". Symbol; a Temple or Wagon Regent. Prajapati was the creator. As the 2nd Arabic manzil, Aldebaran influenced buildings, fountains, wells and gold mines.
The VIIth cusp also falls on Ain (7 ^ C 19`) which enhancing artistic abilities.
4 The Xth cusp on Diadem (8^ G) ( the star giving the ability of the stage) in the constellation of Alpha Coma Berenices and of the nature of Saturn and Mars. Robson says that it is said to give a suave and well-bred manner, with great personal charm, but to lead to an idle and dissipated life. There is some love of, or, ability for the stage.
Out of the four angles the ascendant and the descendant are of mutable signs whereas the 4th and 10th are of cardinal signs. The ascendant is the sign which depicts exploration, sport, etc. while the culmination comprises of the most pleasant sign of the zodiac giving a flair for artistic talents and the stage with the conjunction of Diaden. From the age of 9 till date she is holding the stage and is one of the greatest celebrities the world has ever seen. She is blessed with riches, honours, oratory, etc. At the same time the stars also portend downfall

and death. She escaped the jaws of death at the age of 29 and 68. So far as the VIIth cusp is concerned, on the lower level Aldebaren brings about a deeper involvement in sexual relationships often going beyond traditional social mores, induced by strong impulses and in a state of intoxication. Aldabaren leads the soul into the mundane world with all its pleasures, attachments and drunkenness. It directs the individual towards the physical world of illusion, with all its comforts and luxuries. Further, as Prof. G.B. Forbes points out, the degreecal conjunction of Uranus (lord of III - parakramsthana)) and Venus (lord of VI and X – karmasthana) enhances these tendencies. Hence Elizabeth Taylor did have many marriages and love affairs. Further, from the astrologiocal point of view VIIth lord Mercury is conjunct the Sun in Pisces (a sign of duality and delusion and self undoing) opposed by their dispositor Neptune, a significator of of deceipt, fraud, either by the native or her partners. It is also possible that the parties could be heterosexual or have liking for the members of their own sex.. Many of the ills have been averted due to the mutual reception between Mercury and Neptune. Further Venus is also conjunct Uranus. It is said that when Uranus afflicts Libra, there are problems with marriage. Bernadett Brady: “As
her Venus(17^ A 8`) was setting Procyon (24^ D 24`) was culminating.. Procyon is linked to Venus and connected to her MC (in parans) she is known to the world for her failed marriages.”
Other Cusps On Fixed Star:
The IInd cusp falls on Vega (14^ J 02`) in the Star of Alpha Lyra and of the nature of Venus and Mercury. Ebertin says Vega is supposed to give artistic talents especially for music and acting, but also a liking for good living. With eccentric artists, this may lead to a debauched life. Tied up with Jupiter or Venus, Vega is said to pave the way to riches and fame.
Vth cusp on Tyl (1 ^ B 49`) (the star of emotions and artistic talents) in theconstellation of Draco and of the nature of of Saturn and Mercury. According to Ptolemy the bright stars are like Saturn and Mars. Draco gives an artistic and emotional but somber nature, a penetrating and analytical mind, much travel and many friends. The lord of the Vth house is Venus. Again a significator of art.
VIIIth cusp on a) Dzibin (12^ D 49`) in the constellation of Draco and of the nature of Saturn and Mercury, which is also a star that influences art and artists.
b)Canopus (14^ D 02`) in the constellation of Alpha Carina of the nature of Jupiter and Saturn. Ebertin says that Canopus has been noted several times in the nativities of writers and film actors and especially of those persons who, in our times, have had to undertake many journeys in connection with their position. Robson says that according to Ptolemy it is of the nature of Saturn and Jupiter; and, to Alvidas, of the Moon and Mars. It gives piety, conservatism, a wide and comprehensive knowledge, voyages and educational work, and changes evil to good.

c) Sirus (13^ D 10`) in the constellation of Canis Major and of the nature of Jupiter and Mars. According to Ptolemy it is of the nature of Jupiter and Mars and, to Alvidas, of the Moon, Jupiter and Mars. It gives honor, renown, wealth, ardor, faithfulness, devotion, passion and resentment, and makes its natives custodians, curators and guardians. Ebertin says that according to tradition, Sirius will give a famous death with honors beyond the grave, if positioned in the 8th house. Larousse Encyclopedia of Astrology states that it is a harbinger of fame. Sirius will make her blaze in its glory forever.
XIth cusp is on Syrma (2^ H 50`) in the constellation of Iota Virgo and of the nature of Mercury and Mars. Noonan says that this star is said to be prominent in the charts of Mohammed and Moses, the Arabs considered this star as the most fortunate of their lunar stations. Favorable for extracting treasures.
XIIth cusp is on Unukalahai (21^ H 06`) in the constellation of Alpha Serpensand of the nature of Saturn and Mars. According to Ptolemy it is of the nature of Saturn and Mars; to Simmonite, of Saturn and Venus; to Pearce, of Saturn, Venus and Mars; and, to Alvidas, of Mars and Saturn in opposition to Venus. It gives immorality, accidents, violence and danger of poison.
The Luminaries On The Fixed Stars:
1. The Sun is on Skat (7^ L 54`) in the constellation of Delta aquarius and of the nature of Jupiter and Saturn. According to Ptolemy it is of the nature of Saturn and Jupiter; to Simmonite, of Uranus; and, to Alvidas, of Uranus and Venus in sextile to Mercury. Robson says it gives good fortune and lasting happiness in general. He further says that when with the Sun, it makes one sensitive, emotional, psychic; criticism and persecution through mediumship, but help from friends. The Sun is conjunct Mercury in Pisces and many good artists have Pisces prominent in their charts. In this case Neptune the dispositor of Sun and Mercury is in Virgo (the sign of meticulous craftsmanship and service to others) is on Thuban (6 Vir 30) which is a star influencing art and acting. Further, there is a mutual reception between Neptune and Mercury. Besides this, Neptune being the higher octave of Venus is also a significator of Art, acting and photography.
2. The Moon is on South Scale( zuben El Genubi) (14^ H 06`) in the constellation of Alpha Libra and of the nature of Saturn and Mars according to Ptolemy, but later authors substitute Saturn and Venus or Saturn and Mercury, and Alvidas likens it to Mars, Venus and Saturn. According to Robson it causes malevolence, obstruction, an unforgiving character, violence, disease, lying, crime, disgrace, and danger of poison. Eric Morse in the Living Stars say that the association of this star with a scorpion's claw, used for making love as well as for slaying its prey. It does not let go until one or other matter is complete and onlookers are not sure which of the two acts are in process. Sometimes even the Scorpion seems to get it wrong along the way! It frequently shows up ill-aspected in many unfortunate situations, from domestic strife and miscarriages of justice to psychopathic killings that started out in

the guise of love. Its appearance in better aspect is often just the right moment to repair a relationship and to reconsider an earlier harsh judgment. Well aspected and on the 'right planet' we have someone of courage who will fight for right, but is generous to his opponents when they are defeated. If harshly aspected, especially to Mars, Saturn or the Moon, justice may well take a back seat to vengeance.
In natal astrology, both the Sun (lord of IX in III house conjunct Mercury the lord of VIII and the Moon, lord of VIIIth in XIth ) are trine to each other from third house and eleventh house. Both are in watery signs full of emotions and with Pluto in Cancer, there is a formation of a grand trine. There is also a mutual reception between the Moon and Pluto, Such a configuration gives easy contacts and increases the power of attraction and emotion, making relationships rather easy and full of gains.
Other Planets And Points On Fixed Stars:
Saturn on Altaire (0^ K 44`) in the constellation of Alpha Aquila and of the nature eof Mars and Jupiter. Robson says that "It is said to give great imagination, strong passions, indomitable will, a dominating character, and influence over others. Associated with immoderate ambition.”
Mars on Enie (0^ L 56`) in the constellation of Epsilon Pegasus and of the nature of Mars and Mercury. The constellation gives ambition, vanity, intuition, enthusiasm, caprice and bad judgment according to Robson.
Jupiter on Dubhe (14^ E 12`) in the constellation of Alpha Ursa Majoris and of the nature of Mercury and Venus. It is said to give a quiet, prudent, suspicious, mistrustful, selfcontrolled, patient nature, but an uneasy spirit and great anger when roused.
Neptune planet signifying art and acting is on Thuban (6^ F 48`) (The star of artistic talent and abilities) in the constellation of Alpha Draco and of the nature of Saturn and Mars. According to Ptolemy the bright stars are like Saturn and Mars. Draco gives an artistic and emotional but somber nature, a penetrating and analytical mind, much travel and many friends, but danger of robbery and accidental poisoning. It gives craft, ingenuity, and valor.
Pluto, the planet of transformation is in an emotional sign, being influenced by Sulaphat (20^
J 54`)(a star giving artistic abilities) in the constellation of Gamma Lyra and of the nature of Venus and Mercury. According to Ptolemy, Lyra (a musical instrument) is like Venus and Mercury. It is said to give an harmonious, poetical and developed nature, fond of music and apt in science and art. Fixed stars influence planets and cusps by conjunction and opposition.
The other two significators of art Venus conjunct Uranus, fall on Nodus II (a star giving
artistic abilities) (16^ A 19`) in the constellation of Draco and of the nature of Saturn and Mars. According to Ptolemy Draco gives an artistic and emotional but somber nature, a penetrating and analytical mind, much travel and many friends.



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY

Rahu on Azelfafe (27^ L 20`) (the star giving love of art and success in occupations of amusements and ornaments) in the constellation of Pi 1 Cygnus and of the nature of Venus and Mercury. Cygnus gives a contemplative, dreamy, cultured and adaptable nature. The affections are ill regulated and unsteady, the talents develop late. There is some love of water and swimming and the arts.
Fortuna on Rigel(15^ C 52`) in the constellation of Beta Orion and of the nature of Jupiter and Mars. According to Ptolemy and Lilly it is of the nature of Jupiter and Saturn, but later authors consider it favorable and similar to Jupiter and Mars. Alvidas likens it to Mercury Mars and Jupiter. It gives benevolence, honor, riches, happiness, glory, renown and inventive or mechanical ability. Rigel is also said to give an early rise and she started acting from the age of nine.
The confusing but very interesting birth chart of Elizabeth Taylor brings a lot of complications and confusions at first sight. But after some introspection it is clear that the lord of the ascendant, Jupiter in Leo (the sign of the showman) is trine the ascendant and Venus conjunct Uranus (also significators of art and acting) This formation of a fiery grand trine through translation of light gives a full flow of artistic talents. A similar grand trine with the element of water is shown between the Moon, Rahu and Pluto, that transforms her expressions through a blend of emotions, mysticism and passion, thereby assisting her raise her status to a superstar uncompated, as portrayed in “Cleopatra”.
The above combinations are influenced by:
1) The stars of the descendant influencing the ascendant with artistic skills and abilities
2) The star of the Xth cusp giving her the abilities of the stage
3) The second cusp having the artistic and musical talents
4) The fifth cusp giving artistic and musical nature
5) The eight cusp influencing art and artists
6) The Sun and Mercury influenced by Thuban in opposition
7) Neptune, the higher octave of Venus on Thuban signifying art.
8) Pluto influenced by Sulaphat (a star of artisitic abilities) by opposition
9) Venus and Uranus (significators of artistic skills) on Nudus II, a star giving artistic talents and skills
10) Rahu on Azelfafe, the star giving love of art and related occupations
11) Fortuna on Rigel giving an early rise
12) Finally, the VIIIth cusp on Sirus, indicating a famous death and in the words of Ebertin “honours beyond the grave”.

NO. 7 Thomas Alva Edison
- the the most influential figure of the millennium..
Born Feb 11 1847 at 11.38 p.m.. Milan, Ohio, USA.- Died Oct 18 1931.
"... Thomas Edison was more responsible than any one else for creating the modern world .... No one did more to shape the physical character of our present day civilization.... Accordingly, he was the most influential figure of the millennium...." The Heroes Of The Age: Electricity And Man
"Be courageous! Whatever setbacks America has encountered, it has always emerged as a stronger and more prosperous nation.... Be brave as your fathers before you. Have faith and go forward!” Thomas Alva Edison
He led no armies into battle, he conquered no countries, and he enslaved no peoples... Nonetheless, he exerted a degree of power the magnitude of which no warrior ever dreamed. His name still commands a respect as sweeping in scope and as world-wide as that of any other mortal - a devotion rooted deep in human gratitude and untainted by the bias that is often associated with race, color, politics, and religion.
Edison was quoted as saying, "Genius is one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration."
In his lifetime, Thomas Alva Edison profoundly affected the technology of modern society. The American inventor was born February 11, 1847 in Milan, Ohio. He was the seventh and last child of Samuel Edison, Jr. and Nancy Elliot Edison. When Edison was 7 years old, his family moved to Port Huron, Michigan, after his father hired on as a carpenter at the Fort Gratiot military post.
Edison entered school in Port Huron, but his teachers considered him to be a dull student. Because of hearing problems, Edison had difficulty following the lessons and his school attendance became sporadic. Nevertheless, Edison became a voracious reader and at age 10, he set up a laboratory in his basement.
Amazingly, during his childhood, he received only three months of schooling. When he was 12 years old, he got a job selling newspapers in Port Huron, Michigan. During his spare time as a paperboy, he would experiment with the printing press and other appliances. During this time, he learned how to operate a newspaper printing press, and in 1862, he published his own weekly paper.
In a strange twist of fate, Edison saved an officials child, and was rewarded by being taught telegraphy. Edison showed his engineering genius with telegraphy when he designed a telegraphic repeating instrument, which could automatically transport a message over a second line. This invention would later on make Edison very rich.
When his mother could not longer stand the smell of his chemistry lab, Edison took a job as a trainboy on the Grand Trunk Railway and established a new lab in an empty freight car.

He was 12 at the time. Edison also began printing a weekly newspaper, which he called the Grand Trunk Herald.
From 1862 to 1868, Edison worked as a roving telegrapher in the Midwest, the South, Canada, and New England. During this time, he began developing a telegraphic repeating instrument that made it possible to transmit messages automatically. By 1869, Edison's inventions, including the duplex telegraph and message printer, were progressing so well, he left telegraphy and began a career of full-time inventing and entrepreneurship
The Principal Inventions And Discoveries Of Thomas Edison.
1868: Invented the electrical vote recorder.
1869: Invented the universal stock ticker and the unison stop.
1872: Invented the motograph. Invented the automatic telegraph system. Invented duplex, quadruplex, sextuplex, and multiplex telegraph systems. Invented paraffin paper. Invented the carbon rheostat.
1875: Discovered "Etheric Force," an electric phenomenon that is the foundation of wireless telegraphy.
1876: Invented the electric pen used for the first mimeographs.
1877: Invented the carbon telephone transmitter, making telephony commercially practical. This included the microphone used in radio. Invented the phonograph. This was Edison's favorite invention. He sponsored the Edison Phonograph Polka to help popularize the new device.
1879:Discovered incandescent light. Radically improved dynamos and generators. Discovered a system of distribution, regulation, and measurement of electric currentswitches, fuses, sockets, and meters.
1880: Invented the magnetic ore separator.
1880: Discovered the "Edison Effect," the fundamental principle of electronics.
1885: Discovered a system of wireless induction telegraph between moving trains and stations. He also patented similar systems for ship-to-shore use.
1891: Invented the motion picture camera.
1896: Invented the fluoroscope. Invented the fluorescent electric lamp.
1900: Invented the nickel-iron-alkaline storage battery.
1914: Invented the electric safety miner's lamp. Discovered the process for manufacturing synthetic carbolic acid.
1915: Conducted special experiments on more than 40 major war problems for the Navy Department. Edison served as Chairman of the Naval Consulting Board and did much other work on National Defense.
1927-1931: Tested 17,000 plants for rubber content as a source of rubber in war emergencies. A piece of vulcanized rubber was made from a Goldenrod strain he developed.

Effects Of Fixed Stars In The Chart Of President APJ Abdul Kalam
Fixed Stars on the angles:
1. The Ascendant on Nusakan (6^ h 59`) in the constellation of Beta Corona Boeralis and of the nature o f Venus and Mars. This is known as "The Crown of Eternal Life," and a biblical association is 'Diadem of Solomon' Latin words for 'crown (corona) and 'horn' (eornu) and both express the same sense of elevation, power and enlightenment. Both are raised above the head and both are the emblems of power and of light. Alchemical iconography depicts the spirits of the planets receiving their light, in the shape of crowns, from the hand of their king, the Sun. All crowns share the dazzle and symbolism of the solar crown. Both in yoga and in Islam, too, the crown of the head is the point through which the soul escapes the confines of the body to ascend to superhuman states. In Hindu fashion, it is the sahasrara padma, the thousand~leaved lotus. It is a proverbial symbol of the principle that guides learning and knowledge.
2. IVth house on Alnair (12^ k 54`) in the constellation of Alpha Grus. Tobsons describes this constellation as a retiring, active, proud, watchful, kind, idealistic and devoted nature, with a liking for astronomy.
3. VIIth cusp on a) Hamal(5^ B 30`) in the constellation of Alpha Arietis and of the nature of Saturn and Jupiter. It is termed as a yellowstar on the forehead of the Ram. Dr. Eric Morse states "All the Aries stars have been in the sign Taurus for 200-300 years now. Hamal just over 600, (Botein year 505AD) and in this same period we have seen large-scale aggression change its nature from barbaric raiding and migration of earlier centuries to the building of large empires which had to be administered and kept in peace and good order, as well as exploited by their conquerors. This is typical both of the sign Taurus and of the planet Saturn". According to Dr. Eric Morse it is headstrong and often aggressive, yet potentially capable leaders and protectors of their community, all qualities of the
Ram and the Bull. b)Schedir (5^ B 40`) in the constellation of Alpha Cassiopeia and of the nature of Saturn and Venus. According to Ebertin this star incorporates serious demeanor with joi-se-vivre. This star is not considered unlucky, but a certain amount of demonic power seems to be ascribed to it. Should good living transgress reasonable limits the results will be
disadvantageous). c)Adhil (5^ B 44`) in the constellation of XI Andromedia and of the nature of Venus. Robson say that it "It is said to bestow purity of thought, virtue, honor and dignity upon its natives, but to cause battle with chimerical (wildly fanciful, highly improbable) fears and a tendency to become easily discouraged.
4. Xth cusp on Dubhe(13^ E 43`) in the constellation of Alpha Ursa Major According to Raobson it is said to give a quiet, prudent, suspicious, mistrustful, self-controlled, patient nature, but an uneasy spirit and great anger when roused.

The Other Cusps On The Fixed Stars
VIth cusp on Alphertz (12^ A 11`) in the constellation of Alpha Andromeda and of the nature of Jupiter and Venus. Nearly every inventor and "famous first" has a connection to this star and Alpheratz was activated when many worthwhile inventions were patented or brought to public attention. The traditional influences gives independence, freedom, love.
VIIth cusp on Hyadium II (4^ C 40`)(a star assisting inventions) in the constellation of Gamma Taurus and of the nature of Saturn-Mercury in Ptolemy's coding, which we might well describe as unhappy thoughts and so it shows up when the star is on a difficult spot or planet in a horoscope. But if it be harmonious in aspect, instead, the same star denotes a good clear thinker, writer or speaker. (Dr. Eric Morse).
The cusp on XIth Coxa (12^ F 28`) in the constellation of Teta Leo and of the nature of Saturn and Venus. This star thetaCoxa shares with delta Zosma share the 10th nakshatra, Purva Phalguni, delta being the junction star between the two Phalguni asterisms. These stars are said to give the ability to prophesy [perhaps relating to the symbolism of the bookcarrying lion in his prophetic role (Allen).
XIIth cusp on Algorab(11^ G 30`) in the constellation of Delta Corvus and of the nature of Mars and Saturn. Robson says that according to Ptolemy, Corvus is like Mars and Saturn. It is said to give craftiness, greediness, ingenuity, patience, revengefulness, passion, selfishness, lying, aggressiveness and material instincts, and sometimes causes its natives to become agitators.
Luminaries on fixed stars:
The Sun on Sador (22^ K 44`) in the constellation of Gamma Cygnus and of the nature of Venus and Mercury. Sador is a star in the breast of The Swan Cygnus. Cygnus gives a contemplative, dreamy, cultured and adaptable nature. The affections are ill regulated and unsteady, the talents develop late. In the Far East the swan is the symbol of gracefulness, nobility and valor. It is hard to separate the two birds in Hindu iconography; Brahma's 'swan' (Hamsa) used as his steed has the appearance of a wild goose. As de Mallmann says, the etymological kinship between hamsa and anser (Latin for 'goose') 'hits one between the eyes'. The Hamsa which was Varuna's steed was a water-fowl; Brahma's steed was the symbol of the elevation of the unformed towards the Heaven of knowledge.
The Moon on Facies (6^ J 10`) in the constellation of M22 Sagittarius and of the nature of Mars and the Sun. Dr. Eric Morse says that there is a positive side to Facies, it symbolizes well that kind of Sagittarian who goes out to climb mountains, race cars, enter the ski-jump team or the Grand National steeplechase, making it right to the top and no doubt breaking a few bones along the way. On the more philosophical side it will mark those who must see their outlook and beliefs carried into practical effect somewhere, so that they go out on missions, set up their own churches and centers engage in good works of famine or refugee relief and so on. Inevitably they get hurt at times, but perhaps find compensation in the value of their works. .

Other Planets On Fixed Stars
Mars on Polis (1^ J 05`) in the constellation of Mu Sagittarius and of the nature of Jupiter and Mars.According to Robson it gives success, high ambition, martial desires, horsemanship, keen perception and domination.
Mercury on Nashira(19^ K 40`) in the constellation of Gamma Capricornus and of the nature of Saturn and Jupiter. According to Ebertin, dependent on its position in the chart it will bring a life full of change. According to Arabic tradition this star will make a native become a legal advisor or counselor and will give such a person the ability to hold a position of trust. This star makes for integrity and justice and gives a knowledge of man. Therefore we see here a refining Saturn influence, this will be achieved if the natal Saturn is well placed.
Saturn on Sadalmelak (a star favourable for scientific pursuits & helping invention for the
purpose of gains)(1^ L 40`) in the constellation of Alpha Aquarius and of the nature of Saturn and Mercury and according to Robson it gives the traits of originality, inventive, psychic, careful, cautious, practical, good judgement, difficulty in putting ideas or inventions into practice, gain through companies, speculation and matters of an earthy nature, chronic illness to wife or children, favorable for gain, long life.
Saturn on Formulhat(1^ L 43`) (a star making a successful scientist) in the constellation of Alpha Piscis and of the nature of Venus and Mercury. According to Ebertin it has a Mercury-Venus character with a blending of Neptune influence. According to tradition, this star is of quite variable effect, either very good or very bad, depending on the overall cosmic structure. It is assumed, however, that the helpful influence is the greater one and if in conjunction with Mercury, it is said to stimulate mental capabilities and promise success as a writer or scientist.
Jupiter on Ain (6^ C 20`) and Aldaberan (6^ C 40`) in the constellation of Epsilon Taurus and of the nature of Mercury and Mars. Dr. Eric Morse says that if it be harmonious in aspect, instead, the same star denotes a good clear thinker, writer or speaker.
Rahu on Acamar(21^ A 08`) in the constellation of Theta Eridanus and of the nature of Jupiter. According to Ptolemy all the stars with the exception of Achernar are like Saturn. Robson says that Eridanus gives a love of knowledge and science, much travel and many changes, a position of authority, but danger of accidents, especially at sea, and of drowning.
According to Brihat Parasari Hora Shastra , the Ascendant, the Sun and the Moon are of the greatest importance in a chart, for they represent the personality, the soul and the mind. Edison’s ascendant falls in Scorpio, the sign that enables man to dig into secrets of nature. The Sun falls in the most intellectual sign of inventions and discoveries and the Moon falls on the Archer’s Bow in the sign of ambitions, perseverance and organization. He was truly
capable of imbibing the good traits of Facies as Saturn is on Sadalmelak(1^ L 40` ) giving traits of invention, originality, perseverance, caution and practical use of knowledge and on

Formalhaut of the charcter of Mercury-Venus with a blending of Neptune (Saturn’s dispositor). The stars on various cusps and planets also denote that he is the 'Diadem of Solomon' , the sahasrara padma, the thousand~leaved lotus, a proverbial symbol of the principle that guides learning and knowledge, with a love of knowledge and science, a good clear thinker, with mental capabilities and promises success as a writer or scientist, the symbol of the elevation of the unformed towards the Heaven of knowledge. Saturn , the planet of patience, which is a great virtue of a scientist and inventor, is on Sadalmelek and Formalhaut, both giving him success as a scientist, is trine his IXth house (research and development) and also his ascendant, givng him difficultes in putting ideas or inventions into practice, but in this process leading him to perfection.
The lord of the ascendant plays a significant role in the success of a native’s life. Pluto is conjuct Rahu, on Acamar in the constellation of Eridanus, (Eridanus gives a love of knowledge and science). The Sun, lord of Xth, conjunct Mercury and Neptune, all in the sign of science , technology and invention are sextile Rahu and Pluto in the dynamic, pioneering and ever modern sign Aries, enabling the native spearhead into the field of
inventions and discoveries. Pluto is on Al Pherg (24^ A 31`), a star giving success through determination according to Noonan. Robson says that it is a star of preparedness, steadiness and final success.

Charlie Chaplin
- the memorable tramp
Birth Date : 04/16/1889 (Apr 16, 1889)
Birth Time : 20:00 (08:00 PM) GMT(+0:00)
Birth Place : London, England
Latitude / Longitude : 51 N 30 / 00 W 10
The British-American entertainer, writer, director and producer was perhaps best known for his creation of the memorable character, the Tramp, also known as the Little Fellow or simply Charlie. He first went on stage at age five.
From 1895 until his death on August 28, 1928, his mother was in and out of institutions with physical and emotional problems. With an alcoholic father who could not care for them, Charlie and his older half-brother Sydney were placed in children's homes and workhouses.
Charlie first took to the stage when, aged 5, he performed in Music Hall in 1894 when he stood in for his mother, from whom he learned to sing and act. In 1900, aged 11, his brother helped get him the role of a comic cat in the pantomime Cinderella at the London Hippodrome. In 1903 he appeared in Jim, A Romance of Cockayne, followed the same year by his first regular job when he started playing the part of newspaper boy Billy in Sherlock Holmes, a part he played into 1906. This was follwed by joining Casey's Court Circus variety show, and the following year he became a clown in Fred Karno's Fun Factory slapstick comedy company. With Karno, he visited the US in 1913 and his act was seen by film producer Mack Sennett who hired Chaplin for his film studio, Keystone.
His first sound picture, The Great Dictator (1940) was an act of defiance against Adolf Hitler and fascism. Hitler, who was a great fan of movies, is known to have seen the film twice.
Chaplin's political sympathies always lay with the left. Several of his movies depict the dismal situation of workers and the poor, with Modern Times (1936) being a prime example.
Although Chaplin had his major successes in the United States, he refused to accept U.S. citizenship; he was born in England and proudly retained his British nationality. During the era of McCarthyism, Chaplin was accused of "un-American activities" as a suspected communist, and his lifelong enemy J. Edgar Hoover, who had instructed the FBI to keep extensive files on him, tried to remove his residency rights.
In 1952, Chaplin left the United States for a trip to England; Hoover learned about it and negotiated with the INS that his reentry permit would not be honored. Chaplin decided then to stay in Europe and made his home in Switzerland. He returned briefly for an award ceremony in 1972.

Chaplin won the honorary Oscar twice. When the first Oscars were awarded on May 16, 1929, the voting audit procedures that now exist had not yet been invented, and the categories were still very fluid. When it became apparent that Chaplin, who had been nominated for Best Actor and Best Comedy Direction, would fail to win either award for his movie The Circus, the Academy decided to give him a special award "for versatility and genius in acting, writing, directing and producing The Circus". The other film to receive a special award that year was The Jazz Singer.
Chaplin's second honorary award came 44 years later in 1972 and was "For the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century". He came out of his exile and collected his award less than a month before the death of J. Edgar Hoover. Chaplin was also nominated without success for Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Original Screenplay for The Great Dictator (1940), and again for Best Original Screenplay for Monsieur Verdoux (1947).
In 1973, he received an Oscar for the Best Music in an Original Dramatic Score for the 1952 film Limelight. Because of Chaplin's difficulties with McCarthyism, the film did not open in Los Angeles when it was first produced. This criterion for nomination was not fulfilled until 1972.
His final films were A King in New York (1957) and A Countess from Hong Kong (1966), starring Sophia Loren and Marlon Brando.
Chaplin's professional successes were repeatedly overshadowed by reports from his private life. In 1918, 28 years old, he married the 16 year old Mildred Harris, followed by a divorce two years later. They had one child together, which died as an infant. In 1924 he fell in love with the 16 year old Lita Grey during the preparations for his movie Gold Rush. They married when she became pregnant, and had two sons together. They divorced bitterly in 1927, with Chaplin making a record-breaking divorce settlement of $825,000 the following year - allegedly turning his hair white. The publication of the divorce court records with many intimate details led to a campaign against Chaplin. In 1936, Chaplin secretly married the actress Paulette Goddard. After a number of happy years, this marriage too ended in divorce in 1942. Shortly thereafter, he met Oona O'Neill, daughter of the dramatist Eugene O'Neill, and married her in 1943. This marriage was a long and happy one, with eight children.
On March 4, 1975, after many years of self-imposed exile from his native country, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. The honour was first proposed in 1956, but vetoed by the British Foreign Office because the British feared that giving the honour to a known communist supporter would damage British relations with the United States, at the height of the Cold War and with planning for the ill-fated invasion of Suez underway.
Charlie Chaplin died in Vevey, Switzerland and was interred in the Corsier-Sur-Vevey Cemetery in Corsier-Sur-Vevey, Vaud, Switzerland. Two months later, on March 3, 1978, his body was stolen from the cemetery, in an attempt to extract money from his relatives. The plot failed, the robbers were captured and the body was recovered 11 weeks later near Lake Geneva.

A film was made in 1992 about his life entitled Chaplin, directed by Academy Award winner Sir Richard Attenborough, and starring Robert Downey Jr, Dan Akyroyd, Geraldine Chaplin (Charlie's daughter), Anthony Hopkins, Milla Jovovich, Moira Kelly, Kevin Kline, Diane Lane, Penelope Ann Miller, Paul Rhys, Marisa Tomei, Nancy Travis, and James Woods.
Effects Of Fixed Stars In The Chart Of Charlie Chaplin
Fixed Stars on the angles :
1. Ascendant on Nusakan(indicating artistic talents and making a living from art)
(7^ H 34`) in the constellation of Beta Corona Borealis and of the nature of Venus and Mercury. According to Ptolemy it is like Venus and Mercury. It is said to give artistic ability, love of flowers, lassitude and disillusionment, but to bring its natives to a position of command.
2. The Nadir on Sador(22^ K 19`) in the constellation of Gamma Cygnus and of the nature of Venus and Mercury. Cygnus gives a contemplative, dreamy, cultured and adaptable nature. The affections are ill regulated and unsteady, the talents develop late.
3. The Descendant is on a) Kaffaljdhma(7^ B 53`) is in the constellation of Gama Cetus and of the nature of Saturn. According to Ptolemy it confers an emotional and charitable nature and according to Robson it makes one amiable, prudent, happy by sea and land, and helps to recover lost goods with the ability to
command. b)Archid(8^ B 40`) in the constellation of Eta Cassopeia and of the nature of Saturn and Venus. According to Robson it gives haughtiness, boastfulness, exaggerated pride and at the same time power of commanding respect.
4. The Culmination is on Subra (22^ E 2`) in the constellation of Omnicron Leo and of the nature of Venus and Mercury.Leo expresses lust for life, ambition, pride and exaltation. Denoted by the royal majesty of the King of Beasts, an emblem of sovereign power, of strength and nobility, and it is coupled to the Sun. Both the Lion and the Sun symbolize life governed by heat, light, glamour, power and the glitter of the elite. Thus Leo-types are like triumphant odes sung to the accompaniment of sounding brass, aflame with the life force. The Leo-type corresponds to the high-powered character of the strong willed fanatic driven by the obsession to do. The love of action, that emotionally active strength, is controlled and directed towards a goal and subservient to long-term designs. A strong nature, inherently endowed with a full-blooded enjoyment of life, finds justification for existence by making the heavens ring with its achievements. This power can be expressed as horizontal deployment, as a Herculean type of efficiency, as physical presence, physical activity, the here and now. However, it may also be deployed in vertical tension and provide an Apollonian type of idealism, in which the powers of enlightenment tend to rule unrivalled.

Other cusps of the fixed stars
IInd cusp on a) Han (7^ I40`) falls on the constellation of Zeta Ophiucus and of the nature of Saturn and Venus It is said to give a passionate, blindly good-hearted, wasteful and easily seduced nature, together with little happiness, unseen dangers, enmity, strife and
slander. b)Antares(8Sag13`) in the concstellation of Alpha Scorpius and of the nature of Mars and Jupiter. Ebertin says that it is a Mars nature, in which the powers of Mercury and Jupiter and Saturn are also added. Antares makes people tough, belligerent and pugnacious. This is an important star for military personnel and is said to convey mental alertness, strategic ability and courage and to make dare-devils.
IIIrd cusp on a) Marubrium(13^ J 52`) the constellation of Omicrum Saggitarus and of the nature of Sun and Mars, causing blindness, explosions, fire, flaring heat heroism, courage,
and defiance. But it is star of high performance and activity. b)Vega (13^ J 46`) (artistic talents especially for music and acting) in the consteelatin of Alpha Lyra and of the nature of Venus and Mercury. RH Allen says that “ It was one of the stars in the Hindu 20th nakshatra, Abhijit, "Victorious", the most northern of these stellar divisions and far out of the Moon's path [usually the stars in moon mansions are ecliptic stars], but apparently utilized to bring in this splendid object; or, as Mueller says, because it was of specially good omen, for under its influence the gods had vanquished the Asuras; these last being the Hindu divinities of evil, similar to the Titans of Greece. It was the doubtful one of that country's lunar stations, included in some, but omitted in others of their lists in all ages of their astronomy, and entirely different from the corresponding Arabic manzil and Chinese sieu, which lay in Capricorn. The Hindus figured it as a Triangle, or as the three-cornered nut of the aquatic plant Cringata.
Vega, along with Deneb Adige in the Swan, and Altair in the Eagle, forms the Great Summer Triangle”
Ebertin says that in a good cosmic configuration, Vega is supposed to give artistic talents especially for music and acting, but also a liking for good living. With eccentric artists, this may lead to a debauched life. Tied up with Jupiter or Venus, Vega is said to pave the way to riches and fame. He further says that one can find Vega in corresponding aspects in birth charts of statesmen, politicians, persons of importance and influential persons with adequate aspects.
In the present case Jupiter is conjunct the 3rd cusp and Venus and Mars makes a trine to it. Charlie Chaplin had great talents both for acting and music and has been in a position to express the depth of the feelings of conscious mind by remembering the plight of the common man through his artistic symbol the tramp very forcefully and yet in a refined manner to the public at large.
Vth cusp on Matar(24^ L10`) in the constellation of Eta Pegasus and of the nature of the Sun. Pegasus is also indicative of a specific mission in life which the inquirer will always find the time and energy to pursue, although the path may be sewn with difficulties and limitations. The fifth cusp falls near the exaltation degree of Venus and Venus is sextile to the fifth cusp along with Mars. Creativity and artistic abilities are forceful and refined, at the same time.

Cubism and Modern art weren't either scientific or intellectual; they were visual and came from the eye and mind of one of the greatest geniuses in art history. "He was a rebel from the start and, as a teenager, began to frequent the Barcelona cafes where intellectuals gathered. He soon went to Paris, the capital of art, and soaked up the works of Manet, Gustave Courbet, and Toulouse-Lautrec, whose sketchy style impressed him greatly. Then it was back to Spain, a return to France, and again back to Spain - all in the years 1899 to 1904. "In 1905, Picasso went briefly to Holland, and on his return to Paris, his works took on a classical aura with large male and female figures seen frontally or in distinct profile, almost like early Greek art.

Picasso and Braque were great innovative artists in search of new ways to express space and form in painting. They were influenced by Paul Cezanne, African tribal art and Iberian sculpture. First they worked alongside one another (1906-1909 pre-cubism) and then started to work hand in hand to further advance their concepts into what was later termed analytical cubism (autumn 1909 - winter 1911/1912), a style in which densely patterned nearmonchrome surfaces of incomplete directional lines and modelled forms constantly play against one another. The second phase of Cubism was called synthetic cubism. These works of art were composed of distinct superimposed parts - painted or often pasted onto the canvas.

Effect of fixed stars in the chart of Pablo Picasso
Fixed Stars on the angles
1. Ascendant on Giansar (9^ E 05`) in the constellation of Lambda Draco and of the nature of Saturn and Mercury. According to Ptolemy the bright stars are like Saturn and Mars. Draco gives an artistic and emotional but somber nature, a penetrating and analytical mind, much travel and many friends, but danger of robbery and accidental poisoning. It gives craft, ingenuity, and valor.
2. The Nadir is on Miaplacidus (00^ H 44`) in the constellation of Beta Carina and of the nature of Saturn and Jupiter. This star has been activated in a number of events in connection with the introduction of telecommunications and satellites. Prosperity in trade and voyages. Strength of mind and spirit.
3. The Descendant is on Albali(9^ K 24`) in the constellation of Epsilon aquarius and of the nature of Mars and Mercury. It was the brightest one of the Arabic 21st manzil, Al Sa'd al Bula', "the Good Fortune of the Swallower" and its influence causes liberty of captives and heals the sick. According to Noonan it gives good fortune.
4. The Culmination is on Mirach (29^ A 17`),( the star that gives inspiration in artistic creation, with the lord of his karmasthan, Mars,on Dzibiban, the star give the potential in the artistic world outside his land) in the constellation of Beta Andromeda and of the nature of Venus. Robson says that according to Ptolemy it is of the nature of Venus; and, to Alvidas, of Mars and the Moon. It gives personal beauty, a brilliant mind, a love of home, great devotion, beneficence, forgiveness, love, overcoming by kindness, renown, and good fortune in marriage. Ebertin says that it gives many interests, tendency to inspiration and medium-ship as a base for artistic creations, altruism, cheerfulness, happiness, love of company. These people have a stimulating effect on others, they make friends easily and are helped on in life by others.
Other cusps on the fixed stars
IIIrd cusp on Markeb (27^ F 38`) in the constellation of Argo Navis and of the nature of Saturn and Jupiter. According to Robson it gives piety, a wide knowledge, educational work and voyages.



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 221 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
Vth cusp is on Marfik (4 ^ I 19`) in the constellation of Lambda Ophiucus and of the nature of Saturn and Venus. It is said to give a passionate, blindly good-hearted, wasteful and easily seduced nature, together with little happiness, unseen dangers, enmity, strife and slander. Pliny said that it occasioned much mortality by poisoning. This constellation has also been called Aesculapius and held to rule medicines.
The VIII cusp falls on Enie (00^ L 37`) in the constellation of Epsilon Pegasus and is of the nature of Mars and Mercury. Pegasus syndrome is concerned with the innate ability possessed by some people to negotiate difficulties by rising above them, on the one hand, and the danger of over reaching themselves, on the other. Pegasus is also indicative of a specific mission in life which the inquirer will always find the time and energy to pursue, although the path may be sewn with difficulties and limitations. Noonan says that it indicates danger in battles.
IXth cusp falls on a) Azelfafage (27^ L 01`) in the constellation of Cygnus nad of the nature of Venus and Mercury. Robson says that Cygnus gives a contemplative, dreamy, cultured and adaptable nature. The affections are ill regulated and unsteady, the talents develop late. There is some love of water and swimming and the arts.
The Romans gave Cygnus the more specific title of the Swan. In Hinduism the swan and goose are interchangeable in myth and legend. The Hamsa can be depicted as either, it is Ham Sa, 'that pair of swans' who depict perfect union, they also portray breath and spirit. Brahma, has the swan or goose as an attribute and can have one as his mount. Like the Egyptian goose it was the bird that laid the Cosmic Egg on the waters. Brahma sprang from this Golden Egg. The swan was also the vehicle of his wife Saraswati, goddess of wisdom, learning and music, etc. Swans used as figureheads on ships, bring good luck since swans do not plunge themselves below the waves. The fable that the swan sings beautifully just before it dies is very ancient, but baseless; hence the last work or appearance of a poet, composer, actor etc. One Greek legend has it that the soul of Apollo, the God of music passed into a swan, hence the Pythagorean fable that the souls of all good poets passed into swans.
b) The IXth cusp also falls on Scheat (28^ L 06`) in the constellation of Beta Pegasus of the nature of Mercury and Mars. Ebertin says that it can have a positive effect on their mental creativity, if these people are ready to receive such inflow . Pegasus is considered to be an fortunate constellation, this star gives all the creative talents that Pegasus bestows.
XIth cusp falls on Hyadium II (5^ C 35`) in the constellation of Delta Taurus and of the nature of Saturn and Mercury. Dr. Eric Morse says that if it be harmonious in aspect, instead, the same star denotes a good clear thinker, writer or speaker.
The Luminaries On Fixed Stars:
The Sun is on Syrma (2^ H 32`) in the constellation of Iota Virgo and of the nature of Mercury and Mars. Noonan says that it is said to be prominent in the charts of Mohammed and Moses, the Arabs considered this star as the most fortunate of their lunar stations. Favorable for extracting treasures.

Dr. Eric Morse says that in Arabic it is called Al Ghafar means to cover, to protect and to suppress. The significance of this star and title lies firstly in the heavy personal responsibility which is implicit in the occult questing and acquisition of spiritual power.
If Mohammed and Moses had the power to follow their own destinies and create their path of success and glory, surely Picasso too had such powers in the field of art and its new and revolutionary concepts. In his chart , the ascendant lord, the Sun is in scorpio, in an inconjunct aspect to its despositor, Pluto in the sign of art and sculptor, Taurus. But Pluto is in conjunction with Jupiter the Lord of 5th (art, creativity, etc) . Further Pluto is also in opposition of Mercury(in the house of Pluto) who is the lord of XIth. But the Sun being the Lord of the Ascendant, and the Ascendant being on the star of Giansar in the constellation of Draco, which gives an artistic and emotional but somber nature, a penetrating and analytical mind, much travel and many friends, craft, ingenuity, and valor. Further, the Sun is semi square Uranus in the sign of Virgo, the sign of meticulous craftsmanship. Mercury, lord of 2 and 11 is sextile to Uranus, giving opportunities to blend meticulous cratsfmanship with the secrets of a revolutionary art, that is cubism and modern art, of which Picasso was one of the pioneers. The Sun and Mercury in the secretive and passionate sign of Scorpio get very hard vibrations of opposition from Saturn (discipline and hard work), Neptune (inspiration and mysticism), Jupiter (Planet lord of Vth in the chart, concerning expansion in creativity) and Pluto the dispostor of the Sun and Mercury(on a star said to give strength of character, tenacity and fixity of purpose, an ardent nature and dangerous passions), all in conjunction through the translation of light in this intercepted sign. These hard aspects leading to a total transformation of character shows the trials and tribulations he underwent to the extent of becoming a rebel, were softened by the sextile aspect of Venus to the ascendant and a semisextile aspect to the Sun, the ascendant lord. Further, Venus (signifying art, beauty, refinement, luxury, etc.) makes a sextile to the Moon in the Vth (house of art and creativity) to the other luminary, the Moon which is also conjunct the Vth cusp. Further, the times and social and family background ought also to be taken into consideration. Because of his father’s talents and Picasso’s artistic talents flourised. This background was responsible for Picasso to handle the revolutionary turn of art very successfully.
The Moon is on Antares (8^ I 29`) in the constellation of Alpha Scorpius. This is one of the four key stars in the heavens, also called archangel stars. Oriel (Antares) Watcher of the West. At one time they marked the two Equinoxes : Aldebaran marked the zero Aries point in 3044 BC, Antares marked zero Libra 3052 BC. Antares alone constituted the 16th Arabic manzil, Al Kalb, "the Heart", one of the fortunate lunar stations. The Hindus used alpha (Antares), sigma, and tau for their 16th nakshatra Jyestha, "Oldest", also known as Rohini, "Ruddy", from the color of Antares, — Indra, the sky-goddess, being regent of the asterism that was figured as a pendent Ear Jewel. Robson say that if the Moon be with Antares the native will be popular, broad-minded, interested in philosophy, science and metaphysics, liable to change religious opinions, influential friends, favorable for business and domestic matters, active in local affairs, great power, honor and wealth.The Moon is on Antares, trine to the ascendant, sextile to Venus in Libra in the Vth house connected with art and creativity in a sign of exploration, research using the higher mind.

In India it was Vashishtha (or Vasishta, or Vasisht), "most wealthy" (born from Brahma's breathing), one of the Seven Sages. Vasishta is supposed to have been born as the result of Brahma’s will power. He was a great ascetic, and labored for the welfare of the world. Ebertin says that Mizar portends a Mars nature. It is not wrong to assume that besides handicaps, artistic emanations can also be attributed to Mizar.
b)Fortuna is also on Alcor (14^ F 34`) in the constellation of Ursa Major and of the nature of Mars. Manilus Astronomica says that those born at the rising of this constellation will be tamers of wild beasts, that is men to teach bears, bulls and lions to lay aside their fierceness and share in human ways.

The constellation is also known as Argo Navis is a symbolic archetype of a great ship, which crosses the waters of the Deluge as in the Biblical tale of Noah's Arc. The ship is like a star which orbits about its pole, the earth, but under human control. It is a picture of life in which the individual must choose a goal and steer a safe course through the waves of worldly dangers. They also represent adventure, exploration, setting out on the sea of life and thus the symbol of life "the journey of life", but also crossing the waters of death; in this connection ships share the bridge symbolism in crossing from this world to the next.
Saturn is on Azha (8^ B 57`) in the constellation of Eta Eridanus and of the nature of Saturn. Robson says that according to Ptolemy all the stars with the exception of Achernar are like Saturn. Eridanus gives a love of knowledge and science, much travel and many changes, a position of authority.
Jupiter is on a) Capulus (22^ B 53`) in the constellation of Perseus and of the nature of Mars and Mercury. Robson says that it gives an intelligent, strong, bold and adventurous nature, but a tendency to lying.
b)Jupiter is also on Segin in the constellation of Epsilon Casseopia and of the nature of Saturn and Venus. Robson says that it gives haughtiness, boastfulness, exaggerated pride and at the same time power of commanding respect.
Pluto is on a)Beid (28^ B 09`) in the constellation of Erindanus and of the nature of Saturn. Robson says that according to Ptolemy all the stars with the exception of Achernar are like Saturn. Eridanus gives a love of knowledge and science, much travel and many changes, a position of authority.

b)Celaeno(28^ B 09`) in the constellation of Taurus and of the nature of Moon and Mars. They are said to make their natives wanton, ambitious, turbulent, optimistic and peaceful; to give many journeys and voyages, success in agriculture and through active intelligence according to Ptolemy.
Mars is on a)Dziban (21^ D 21`) in the constellation of Draco and of the nature of Saturn and Mars. According to Ptolemy Draco gives an artistic and emotional but somber nature, a penetrating and analytical mind, much travel and many friends.
b)Sirius (12^ D 49`) in the constellation of Alpha Canis Major and of the nature of Jupiter and Mars. Dr. Gonzales Tamez says it had been advanced that because Sirius is the Sun of the Sun, in as much as the Sun spins around Sirius just like the Earth spins around the Sun, and given that the Sun in the chart signifies the Ego, as the center of personal identity, Sirius comes to mean in the chart The SuperEgo, or an even higher center of personal identity, the OverSelf. According to Ptolemy it is of the nature of Jupiter and Mars and, to Alvidas, of the Moon, Jupiter and Mars. It gives honor, renown, wealth, ardor, faithfulness, devotion, passion and resentment, and makes its natives custodians, curators and guardians. According to tradition, Sirius will give a famous death with honors beyond the grave, if positioned in the 8th house. Larousse Encyclopedia of Astrology says that it is regarded as a harbinger of fame. It's a star of success although it can also be on the extravagant side. Sirius appears to heighten the beneficial qualities of that planet it is affiliated with. Bernadette Brady extends this interpretation further: "This very strong star indicates that you may, by your effort, gain far more than what is expected. Hence a small action becomes a symbol for the collective, a sense of ritual in daily life." Importantly, she says the success Sirius brings can "burn you." So Picasso’s burning activities and endeavours represented by Mars, his lord of the Karmasthan tenanting the XIIth ( in distant lands) were shining in the blazing glory of Sirus, the Sun of Sun.

NO: 10 Neil A. Armstrong
- Astronaut, Explorer, and Space Pioneer
"That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind."
Neil Alden Armstrong came into this world on Aug 5, 1930 at 5.41 a.m. at Wapakoneta, Ohio, USA, in a bedroom in his grandparents' farmhouse near Wapakoneta, Ohio, and he left it on June 16, 1969 in what is perhaps the greatest adventure in human history. Almost from the beginning, Armstrong proved to be an exceptionally bright child, learning to read before school age. In the first grade, he read an amazing 90 books. Tests showed that he was reading at a fifth grade level, which help permit him to skip the second grade.
Armstrong's youth was typical as you could find for a boy growing up in the rural Midwest of the 1930s and 1940s. He was a Boy Scout, developed a deep love for music and spent many nights looking skyward through a neighbor's telescope often focusing on the meteorpitted surface of the moon. However, an experience at the age of six would change his life forever. One day, his father had a big surprise for his son --- his first airplane ride. Flying and Neil Armstrong: It was love at first sight. In his dreams in a bedroom filled with airplane models, the thought of flying became an all-consuming passion. When he was a little older, Armstrong would hang around the local airport doing odd jobs for the pilots and soaking in the stories of the veteran flyers, many of who had barnstormed the country during the "Roaring 20s." And while most of his teen-age friends were looking forward to driving a car, Armstrong was intent on learning how to fly. And he made it: Getting his pilot license before he got his driver's license. When it became time to go to college, the choice of a major was obvious. So, Armstrong enrolled at Indiana's Purdue University where he began the study of aeronautical engineering, which would someday allow him to design the airplanes he would fly. However, when the Korean War broke out in 1950, Armstrong, 20, set aside his books and joined the United States Navy where he became a jet pilot--- the youngest in his squadron. Assigned to the aircraft carrier Essex, Armstrong flew 78 combat missions during his tour of duty. It was during one of those missions that Armstrong was nearly killed. One of the wings of his jet was badly damaged during a bombing run. However, he managed, through a combination of skill and coolness, to keep the plane airborne long enough to get out of enemy territory before parachuting to safety. Deciding to return to civilian life following the war, Armstrong went back to Purdue and got his degree in 1955. Now married with two sons and a daughter (The little girl died very young.), Armstrong now moved his family to California where he went to work for the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics --- the forerunner of the National Aeronautical and Space Administration --- and was stationed at Edwards Air Force Base to work on developing high-speed rocket planes. It was at Edwards that Armstrong joined the select group of highly skilled test pilots who were pushing the very boundaries of flight by going higher, faster and farther with such experimental aircraft as the X-15. In 1962 the 32-yearold Armstrong joined NASA's astronaut corps. Armstrong's first mission was a mixture of triumph and near-disaster. In 1966, he piloted Gemini 8 to the first successful docking of two vehicles in space. Under Armstrong's skillful piloting, Gemini successfully docked with an unoccupied space vehicle that had been launched earlier. It was an important test proving



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 227 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
that spacecrafts could meet and be refueled and resupplied --- a necessity for any future space stations.
But then the trouble began: Soon after undocking, the two-person Gemini capsule suddenly went out of control, tumbling wildly through space. Soon, both Armstrong and fellow astronaut David Scott were dizzy and disoriented. Somehow managing to maintain his calm, Armstrong radio mission control in Houston, Texas, saying, "We've got serious problems here .We're tumbling end over end!"
With only his natural skill as a pilot to save himself and Scott, an ever more disoriented Armstrong finally managed to bring the spacecraft under control. Impressed by his coolness and professionalism, NASA named Armstrong to be commander of the most historic space flight of them all: Apollo 11 --- the first mission to land men on the Moon. And as commander, Armstrong would gain the honor of becoming the first person on Earth to step onto the surface of another world. But Apollo XI would be more than just a scientific accomplishment. It would mean that the United States had triumphed in its long Cold War space race with the then Soviet Union to the Moon. At 9:12 p.m. on July 16, 1969, with more than a million people looking on from nearby beaches, fields and roads, Apollo XI blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida. And by the light of its powerful jet-fueled engines, Apollo XI with its three astronauts, Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, roared into history. Once the Apollo XI began to orbit the Moon, Armstrong and Aldrin prepared to descend to the surface in the lunar module--- or LM --named Eagle to take them to the surface in an area called the Sea of Tranquility. Collins would remain behind to pilot the orbiting command capsule named Columbia. But as with so many other things in his life, all did not go smoothly for Armstrong. Searching the surface of a level-landing site, Armstrong saw the landing module's limited fuel supply be used up at an alarming rate. With but a few precious minutes left, Armstrong finally found a suitable site and took over the pilot controls and landed the vehicle on the Moon. A moment later, he radioed the words an anxious Earth had been waiting to here: "Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed." And with those words, Neil Armstrong began a whole new chapter in human history.
For the first time, mankind had not only gone into space but had landed on another world. But the supreme moment of triumph came several hours later when Armstrong, dressed in his space suit, climbed down the LM's ladder and set foot on the Moon's surface in what was truly a "giant leap for mankind" moment while the eyes of more than a billion people from Wapakoneta, Ohio, to every corner of the world were glued to their television sets. Aldrin followed Armstrong to the surface. And with them, they carried and a small piece of the Kitty Hawk, the plane the Wright Brothers flew in their first powered flight in 1903, an American flag, which they set up on the Moon's powdery surface along with a plaque inscribed with the words: "We came in peace for all mankind."
Now, all the astronauts had to do was get home, but as with so many other things in Armstrong's life, there had to be a near disaster before the triumph. One of the two astronaut's spacesuit had broken off part of the switch controlling the rocket that would enable the LM to blast off from the Moon's surface. What to do? Mission Control in Houston had the answer: Take apart a ballpoint pen and use it to replace the broken switch.

It worked. The Eagle blasted off from Tranquility Base and rejoined the Columbia and made the trip back to Earth on June 24without further incident. Back home, all three astronauts were joyously saluted as heroes. But Apollo XI would be the last space flight for Armstrong. Feeling being the first man on the Moon was enough fame and adventure for one lifetime, Armstrong took an administrative position with NASA. In 1971, Armstrong left the spotlight of the space agency to teach aerospace engineering at the University of Cincinnati where he taught until 1979. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan named Armstrong to the National Commission on Space and the next year was appointed vice chairman of the blueribbon panel that investigated the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger. A quiet, introspective man, Armstrong has tried to avoid the limelight. But in or out of the spotlight, Armstrong will remain for all of time the first man to go where no man had ever gone before.
Significators in the chart of Neil Armstrong:
As his life dealth with engineering, research, aeroplane, bombers, space, space flights, etc. the signaificators are given below:
Air-Uranus, Mercury, Neptune; airman and airplanes: Venus, Aquarius and Uranus; aviation : Aquarius, Uranus, Neptune; aerodynamics: Saturn, Scorpio; aeronautic apparatus:Aquarius and Uranus; bombers:Uranus, mars; adventurous desires –Pluto; rocket flight:Uranus, Pluto; aeronautics:Aquarius, Uranus; Space flights and explorations: Pluto (12th) Uranus (9th) Mars (11th in Gemini, a sign of transport and communication) Aquarius (7th), Saggitarus – the sign of adventure and exploration and Jupiter- the lord of natural IXth (11th – achievement); researcher:Aquarius, Uranus, Mars, Mercury and Scorpio; explosives (Korean War):Uranus, Mars and Leo; Engineer:Uranus and Mars; flight engineer:Saggitarus and Mars; missile engineer – Mars; space and space ships: Uranus and Pluto; destiny :Saturn, Valour-Mars; Prominence: Sun. Uranus is one of the greatest significtors in his charts so far as his education and career is concerned because Uranus is concerned with revolutionary ideas or movements.Uranus (in the IXth) is in the sign of Aries, trine his ascendand and ascendant lord, the Sun. The dispositor of Uranus, Mars is on the star Rgel, the star of science, inventions and discoveries, giving him early rise (as a jet pilot at the age of 20-Korean War). Saturn, the planet of destiny is on Facies, the Archer’s bow, giving him the spirit of war and power of retaliation. Neptune is also on the ascendant, signifying air and space and the realms of exploration, in the earthy and practical sign of meticulous craftsmanship with the motto of service.
Effects Of The Fixed Stars In The Chart Of Neil Armstrong.
The birth chart of Neil Armstrong shows Leo rising with the Sun conjunct on the Ascendant
and also parallel by declinations, both on the Star Acuben (12^ E 31`), of the nature of Saturn and Mercury, whose hall mark is Activity. Dr. Eric Morse says that one significance of Acubens is the enforced use of applied intelligence when finding oneself in combat at someone else's behest. But a generally more positive quality to read from Acubens is that of a sharp intellect and ease of coming to grips with problems, for which one might earn public renown. At the same time it was the enforced use of applied intelligence for NASA of USA in order to be ahead of its cold war opponent, the USSR.

The Angles On The Fixed Stars:
The Ascendant,conjunct the ascendant lord, the Sun, fall on a)Kochab (12^ E 31`) in the constellation of Ursa Minor and of the nature of Saturn and Mercury. According to Ebertin this star has not been researched much.
b)Acuben (12^ E 31`) falls in the constellation of Alpha Cancer and is of the nature of Saturn and Mercury. Robson says that it is a star of Activity. Ebertin says Acubens has a Martian nature and a strong blending in of Saturnian influence, conveying an unbalanced and "jumpy" nature. If the chart is a disharmonious one to people effected by it and especially if Acubens is in conjunction with Mars, Sun or Uranus, this will make for an unsettled mentality and helplessness. If in conjunction with Saturn, major disappointments in life, ordeals and trials, mental suffering, excitements, loss, opposition, disputes and deception are indicated. According to Elsbeth Ebertin's experience, this is the case especially if these persons are in positions of social standing or are politically active. Dr. Eric Morse says that one significance of Acubens is the enforced use of applied intelligence when finding oneself in combat at someone else's behest. But a generally more positive quality to read from Acubens is that of a sharp intellect and ease of coming to grips with problems, for which one might earn public renown. But, again there is the note of doing this under pressure of others demanding 'from behind'.
The nadir falls on a)Miaplacidus (1^ H 03`) in the constellation of Beta Carina, the ship Argo Navis, and of the nature of Saturn and Jupiter, indicating prosperity in trade and voyages. Strength of mind and spirit, according to Ronson. This star has been activated in a number of events in connection with the introduction of telecommunications and satellites according to Anne Wright.
b) Alkalurops (2^ H 15`) is in the constellation of Bootees and of the nature of Mercury and Saturn. It takes the qualities of the constellation. Manilius 1st century AD writes "they will be kings under kings and ministers of state, and be charged with the guardianship of the people, custodianship of great houses and treasures, who confine their business to the care of another's home so that the wealth of monarchs and temple finances will be in their keeping". Any type of occupation that requires planning is influenced by Bootes. These people are the driving force behind government and large corporations. They are the planners and designers, the movers and shakers, who "make the world go round". Bootes symbolizes the elder, the sage, the wise old man who is interested in principles and underlying causes, theories, ideologies, and how the past effects the future. (Conservative) politicians, economists, draftsmen, architects, designers of all kinds. He is the master capable of directing the work of others and of discerning what is in the embryo in the sphere of human development.
c)Princeps (2^ H 15`) in the constellation of Delta Bootees and of the nature of Mercury and Saturn. Robson says that it gives a keen studious and profound mind with the ability for research.

The descendant falls on a) Armus (11^ K 46`) in the constellation of Eta Capriconus and of
the nature of Mars and Mercury and b) Dorsum (13^ K 02`) in the constellation of Capriconus and of the nature of Saturn and Jupiter. The qualities of the constellation: The sign is ruled by Saturn. himself associated with all that is hard, harsh. dark and gloomy. He is the remorseless God of time who crystallizes in human hearts their loftiest ambitions - when be does not doom them to their loss or renunciation. A Capricornian nature bears the marks of this cold, silent and still universe. It is built upon an original movement of self-withdrawal and concentration. Externally this character appears lifeless and often dulled to gray sobriety and self-effacement. However, life retreats to the depths of being and it is the slow upsurge of these deep forces, often long ignored by the person him- or herself, which permits the affirmation of personal qualities by the full exercise of self- control. This self-command is the fruit of long training of the will, exercised to demonstrate mastery of instinct and feeling.
The culmination falls on Mira (0^ B 31`) in the constellation of Cetus and of the nature of Mars and Saturn. According to Ptolemy this constellation is like Saturn. It is said to cause laziness and idleness, but to confer an emotional and charitable nature, with the ability to command especially in war. Makes one amiable, prudent, happy by sea and land, and helps to recover lost goods. Ebertin says that the star’s nature corresponds to Saturn and Jupiter. Connected well and with a well placed Saturn and linked up well otherwise, this will mean prudence, perseverance, versatility, a progressive spirit and endurance in solving difficult problems.
The Other Cusps On The Fixed Stars:
The Vth cusp on Antares (8^ I 52`) in the constellation of alpha Scorpius and of the nature of Mars and Jupiter. The Hindus use alpha (Antares), sigma, and tau for their 18th nakshatra Jyestha, "Oldest", also known as Rohini, "Ruddy", from the color of Antares, — Indra, the sky-goddess, being regent of the asterism that was figured as a pendent Ear Jewel. Allen says that "By virtue of its tail armed with its powerful sting, the Scorpion creates natures ardent for war and active service,” Ebertin says that it is of Mars nature, in which the powers of Mercury and Jupiter and Saturn are also added. Antares makes people tough, belligerent and pugnacious. This is an important star for military personnel and is said to convey mental alertness, strategic ability and courage and to make dare-devils, especially if tied up with the MC, Ascendant, Sun or Jupiter.
The VIth cusp on Ascella (12^ J 40`) in the constellation of Saggitara and of the nature of Jupiter and Mercury. Robson also says that it is of the nature of Jupiter and Mercury. It gives good fortune and happiness.
The VIIIth cusp falls on Formalhaut (2^ L 52`) (a star for a successful scientist). Ebertin says that it has a Mercury-Venus character with a blending of Neptune influence. According to tradition, this star is of quite variable effect, either very good or very bad, depending on the overall cosmic structure. It is assumed, however, that the helpful influence is the greater



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY

one and if in conjunction with Mercury, it is said to stimulate mental capabilities and promise success as a writer or scientist.
The IXth cusp falls on Scheat (28^ L 26`) in the constellation of Pegasus (a star indicating voyages) Ebertin says that there is a positive influence to emanate from Scheat, but only for some people, it can have a positive effect on their mental creativity, if these people are ready to receive such inflow.
The XIIth cusp on and Sirus (13^ D 07`) (the star of a scientist blazing to glory) in the constellation of Canis Major and of the nature of Jupiter and Mercury. According to Ptolemy it is of the nature of Jupiter and Mars and, to Alvidas, of the Moon, Jupiter and Mars. It gives honor, renown, wealth, ardor, faithfulness, devotion, passion and resentment, and makes its natives custodians, curators and guardians. Larousse Encyclopedia of Astrology regards it as a harbinger of fame.
The Luminaries On The Fixed Stars:
The Sun conjunct Ascendant on Acuben (12^ E 31`) : refer to descriptions of ascendant.
The Moon in 5th – Saggitarius on Etamin(28^ I 38`) (the star of travel) in the constellation of Draco and of the nature of Mars and Moon. According to Ptolemy, Draco gives an artistic and emotional but somber nature, a penetrating and analytical mind, much travel and many friends.
Other Planets On Fixed Stars:
Mercury conjunct Neptune falls on El Kophrah (2^ F 40`) in the constellation of Ursa Major and of the nature of Mars. These planets are opposite Sadelmelek and Formalhuat, having their influence of successful scientists. Neptune signifies space and air.
Venus falls on Corpula (24^ F 08`) in the constellation of Canes Venatici and of the nature of Moon and Venus. Robson says this constellation gives a love of hunting and a penetrating mind, making those born under it faithful, keen, clever and fond of speculation.
Mars (in 11th) on Rigel (15^ C 40`) science and inventions and discoveries. Robson says that this constellation gives a love of hunting and a penetrating mind, making those born under it faithful, keen, clever and fond of speculation. According to Ptolemy and Lilly it is of the nature of Jupiter and Saturn, but later authors consider it favorable and similar to Jupiter and Mars. Alvidas likens it to Mercury Mars and Jupiter. It gives benevolence, honor, riches, happiness, glory, renown and inventive or mechanical ability.
Jupiter falls on Mebsuta (9^ D 58`) the star of the mariner.



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY

Saturn falls on Facies(7^ J 19`) in the constellation of Facies and of the nature of Sun and Mars. Dr. Eric Morse says that on the more philosophical side it will mark those who must see their outlook and beliefs carried into practical effect somewhere, so that they go out on missions, set up their own churches and centers engage in good works of famine or refugee relief and so on. Inevitably they get hurt at times, but perhaps find compensation in the value of their works. Normally Facies is a dreaded star and one remembers Bitler, Mao Tse Tung and Margret Thatcher, but many successful personalities have such a star on prominent cusps and planets. The positive side of Facies shows adventure and exploration. Some are of the opinion that this star has Jupiter and Mars connotations and gives enterprise and initiative in pursuits of ideals.
Uranus falls on Modus II (16^ A 16`) in the constellation of Draco and of the nature of Saturn and Mars. According to Ptolemy “the bright stars are like Saturn and Mars. Draco gives an artistic and emotional but somber nature, a penetrating and analytical mind, much travel and many friends, but danger of robbery and accidental poisoning. It gives craft, ingenuity, and valor”.
Pluto falls on Castor (20^ D 22`) in the constellation of Alpha Gemini and of the nature of Mercury. According to Ptolemy it is of the nature of Mercury; to Wilson, Simmonite and Pearce, of Mars, Venus and Saturn; and, to Alvidas, of the Moon, Mars and Uranus. It gives distinction, a keen intellect, success in law and many travels, fondness for horses, sudden fame and honor. Dr, Eric Morse says people with this star prominent and well aspected are exceptionally gifted intellectually. Where these geniuses often need help is in not letting their concern for others go 'over the top'. Ebertin says Castor is influenced by Mercury and has a blend of Jupiter in it. Linked with the Moon or Mercury, it has the effect of such people being blessed with a good nature and fine morals. It is also supposed to convey refined manners. A conjunction with the Sun or Mars will make for energetic characteristics and a certain tendency for satire and cynicism, depending on the position of Mercury or Mars in the chart as a whole.
The 9th and 12th houses teneted by Uranus and Pluto respectively indicate research backed by the Moon in the sign of adventure and exploration. This nature is doubly ensured by the Moon falling in the same navamsha (virgotami). Further Moon makes a trine with Rahu in the sign of the adventurer and pioneer. The cusp of scorpio also falls on Miaplacidus, the star connected with Satellites and telecommunication. Neil Armstrong is born in such times and lives in such an advanced society. Astrological interpretations should also be given by taking into account the Time, Society and Culture one is living, exposed to and influenced by, such a high-tech and advanced society has played a very instrumental role in his transformation, as the lord of Nadir , Pluto is in the 12th , and Uranus in the 9th, indicating long travels to distant lands, exploration backed by research and development. All the significators show that he has a promise to have a career with space, rockets, research, exploration nad service. The dispositor of Pluto is the Moon in the sign of research, adventure and exploration while the dispositor of Uranus is Mars in the 11th house backed by a dignified Jupiter ensuring success. The success is doubly assured as Mars is on Rigel, the star giving an early rise and success in the field of science, tehnology, inventions and explorations.

Space Exploration And The Constellation Aquila.
Gagarin is first man in space, Apr 12 1961 - Saturn/Altair
May 5th , 1961, astronaut Alan B. Shepard Junior became America's first space traveler as he made a 15-minute sub-orbital flight in a capsule launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Saturn/Tarazed
April 21 1972, "Apollo 16" astronauts John Young and Charles Duke explored the surface of the Moon. - NNode/Tarazed
July 1st 1993 The space shuttle "Endeavor" returned from a ten-day mission. Neptune and Uranus/Dheneb
Neil Armstrong’s progressed VIth cusp falls on altair, Alshain and Geidi Algedi (near 1^ Aquarius) in the constellation of Beta Aquila, The Eagle. The name eagle is derived from the Roman name for the golden eagle. The Eagle is the symbol of the USA. Armstrong and Aldrin prepared to descend to the surface in the lunar module--- or LM --- named Eagle to take them to the surface in an area called the Sea of Tranquility. The connection with the constellation Aquila and its stars are also connected with space exploration.
The Sun makes a trine from its royal sign Leo with Uranus tenanting the ever modren sign Aries (IXth house indicating travel) with pioneering and enterprising qualities. Uranus is on
the star Nodus II (16^ A 16`) which gives qualities of penetrating mind with artistic bent of mind, much travel with craft, ingenuity and valour. The dispositor of Uranus, Mars, is in the eleventh house and in the sign of transport and communication and on the star Rigel, denoting inventions, mechanical skills and enabling one to make historical and geographical discoveries. The Moon is conjunct Vertex, the gate of destiny, in the natural ninth house, Saggitarus, the sign of travel, exploration and adventure. Further Moon is trine to Rahu, in the sign of the pioneer and 9th house indicating travel.

PRINCESS DIANA
- Diana, Princess of Wales ...The Peoples Princess
Diana Frances Spencer was born on July 1, 1961 at 7.45 p.m. at Park House, the home her parents rented on the royal family's estate at Sandringham. As a child she occasionally played with Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, who were near her in age. Diana had two older sisters, Sarah and Jane, and a younger brother, Charles.
When Diana was six, her mother left her father. The Spencers divorced in 1969, and Diana's father received custody of the children. In 1975 Diana's father became the eighth Earl Spencer, making Diana a Lady. Diana and her siblings moved to Althorp, the Spencer family estate in Northampton.
Diana attended private boarding schools. Although she wasn't an especially good student, she was excelled at sports, and won trophies for her swimming. She dreamed of being a ballerina, but grew too tall (as an adult she was 5'10"). After leaving school in 1978 she worked as a nanny, waitress, and cleaning woman before becoming a teacher at the Young England kindergarten in Pimlico, London.
Her romance with the Prince of Wales began in 1980. The oldest child of British monarch Queen Elizabeth II, he was 12 years older than Diana, and had previously dated her sister Sarah. Almost from the start, the press took a special interest in "Lady Di." They stalked out her apartment and followed her everywhere. Diana later said that she found the constant attention unbearable.
Diana and Charles were married July 29, 1981 at St Paul's Cathedral. The wedding was broadcast in 74 countries and watched by 750 million people worldwide. Diana was the first English woman to marry an heir to the throne in over 300 years.
At the ceremony the Archbishop of Canterbury said, "Here is the stuff of which fairy tales are made." But the fairy tale was an illusion, as Diana had already discovered. Prince Charles was still in love with an old girlfriend, Camilla Parker-Bowles. "There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded," Princess Diana remarked years later. Distraught, Diana developed bulimia and attempted suicide. Despite her problems, she was a devoted mother to her two sons, Prince William and Prince Harry. She worked tirelessly for charity, and was beloved by the public for her warmth and humanity.
In 1992 Princess Diana decided to expose the truth about her relationship with Prince Charles to the public. She secretly collaborated with author Andrew Morton on his book Diana, Her True Story. The princess's direct involvement in the writing of the book was not revealed to the public until after her death.
The separation of the Prince and Princess of Wales was announced on December 9, 1992. The divorce became officially on August 28, 1996. Princess Diana kept the title Princess of Wales and continued to work for her favorite charities. She and Prince Charles had joint custody of their sons.

In 1997 Princess Diana began a love affair with Emad "Dodi" Fayed, the son of billionaire businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed.
Princess Diana's sudden death led to an unprecedented worldwide outpouring of grief and love. As her brother said at her funeral, she was"the unique, the complex, the extraordinary and irreplacable Diana, whose beauty, both internal and external, will never be extinguished from our minds."
Effects of the Fixed Stars in the life of Diana Frances Spencer
Fixed Stars On The Angles:
1. Ascendant on Sabik (17^ I 22`) in the constellation of Eta Ophiucus and of the nature of Venus and Saturn. According to Manilus, book 5 of Astronomica, 1st century AD, When Ophiuchus, encircled by the serpent's great coils rises, he renders the forms of snakes innocuous to those born under him.

In the lives of the exceptional, astrology proves itself consistently. Without a doubt, in life and in death, Princess Diana was one of the world's exceptional human beings and, as in the case of those special individuals who stand out in the crowd, the astrology of Diana's life showed itself magnificently over the years.
According to Ebertin between Spica and Arcturus there is only a minor difference in longitude but a very large difference in latitude. A blend of mutual influences is frequently given. Although Spica is very much larger and will dominate, it may get more positive character by its blending with Arcturus).
Her Sun in Cancer spoke of an emotional, caring and sensitive woman with a great wealth of feeling and devotion to her loved ones, especially her children. Her Aquarian Moon marked her out as a true humanitarian, whose concern for others outweighed the suffering she endured in her own quest for emotional happiness.
The many eulogies that have been made to Diana since her passing have all asserted her humanity and concern for the welfare of others. But most poignant are the words of her brother, Charles, who said, of all the things Diana was, she was above all, intuitive. These are the qualities of Cancer and Aquarius. Diana had the common touch. She knew instinctively how to connect immediately with people on all levels. It is for this Aquarian ability that she will be most remembered.
Ebertin said born with the fixed stars, Spica and Arcturus, culminating in her chart, she was destined to rise to a position of great fame, to receive lasting honours, to be a leader and pioneer who would go against the grain, and become a defender and protector of the innocent and those in need.
Other Cusps On Fixed Stars
IInd cusp on
a)Tarazed (29^ J 00`) in the constellation of Gamma Equila and of the nature of Mars and Jupiter. "It is said to give great imagination, strong passions, indomitable will, a dominating character, and influence over others, clairvoyance, a keen penetrating mind and ability for chemical research.
b)Sham (29^ J 08`) in the constellation of Alpha Sagitta and of the nature of Mars and Venus. According to Robson it is said to give a keen mind with ability for abstract thought and teaching or writing, irritability, jealousy and danger of hostility and bodily harm.
c) Albeiro(29^ J 20`) in the constellation of Betal 1 Cyagnus and is of the nature of Venus and Mars. According to Robson it gives a handsome appearance, neatness, a lovable disposition and beneficence in despair.

THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 238 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
a position of command, makes its natives guilty of bloodshed, and gives danger from reptiles.
Vth cusp on Rucha(16^ B 00`) in the constellation of Delta Casseopia and of the nature of the nature of Saturn and Venus. Accoridng to Robson it gives haughtiness, boastfulness, exaggerated pride and at the same time power of commanding respect.
XIIth cusp o Zabbah(4^ I 06`) in the Constellation of Nu Scorpius and of the nature of Mercury and Mars. It was believed to be included in the Arabic 15th manzil, Iklil al Jabhah, "the Crown of the Forehead". This was one of the fortunate stations, and from this manzil title comes the occasional Iclil. [Influences: Improves misfortune, makes love durable, strengthens buildings and helps seamen (Robson)].
Indian astrology considers the group as their Anuradha, "Propitious" or "Successful", "Mitra, the Friend", one of the Adityas, being the presiding divinity; and they figured it as a "Row" or "Ridge", which the line of component stars well indicates. (Allen).
The Luminaries On Fixed Stars
a) The Sun on Mebsuta(9^ D 06`) in the constellation of Epsilon Gemini and of the nature of Saturn. Ronson says that it is said to cause trouble and disgrace, sickness, loss of fortune, affliction and danger to the knees
b) The Moon on Sador(24^ K 17`)in the constellatin of Gamma Cygnus and of the nature o f Venus and Mars. According to Robson Cygnus gives a contemplative, dreamy, cultured and adaptable nature. The affections are ill regulated and unsteady, the talents develop late. There is some love of water and swimming and the art.
Planets On Fixed Stars:
Venus is on Algol (25^ B 28`) in the constellation of Beta Perseus and of the nature of Saturn and Jupiter, According to Robson it causes misfortune, violence, decapitation, hanging, electrocution and mob violence, and gives a dogged and violent nature that causes death to the native or others. It is the most evil star in the heavens. The last para of the biographic sketch reads as “In 1997 Princess Diana began a love affair with Emad "Dodi" Fayed, the son of billionaire businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed. Their romance ended abruptly on August 31, 1997 when both were killed in a car accident in Paris while fleeing from paparazzi. Princess Diana's sudden death led to an unprecedented worldwide outpouring of grief and love.” Venus on Algol is in the Vth house. She was having romance(Vth house) with Dodi in the car (significator is Venus). Her life after falling in disfavour of the Royalty was under very strict watch, every movement under strict vigil. But the rays of Algol onVenus gave her the daring to challenge and seek her own path of action, irrespective of the consequence. Violent death along with others was personified by Venus on Algol, that too concerning the Vth house matter of romance, entertainment with glamour and luxury. She died a very violent death. According to Noonan “The



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 239 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
constellation is indicative of events effecting large numbers of people.” Her very life and even her death did affect the lives of people all around the world. There was an unprecedented worldwide outpouring of grief and love. Her short life was like a variegated show that ended abruptly as emphasized in The Ode to Intellectual Beauty : “Life like a dome of many coloured glass, stains the white radiance of eternity, until death tramples it to fragments.”
Mars on Precipan (00^ F 20`) in the constellation of Omnicron Leo Minor. It gives a generous, noble, peaceable, but fearless nature, with the ability to undertake prominent and responsible positions. (Robson).Astrologers believed that the clarity of these stars in Leo Minor, foretold the election of meritorious men. (Staal).
Jupiter on Bos (4^ K 40`) in the constellation of Rho Capriconus and of the nature of Saturn and Venus. According to Robson it indicates The Wheel of Fortune"..
Uranus on Subra(23^ E 43`) in the constellation of Omnicron Leo and of the nature of Mercury and Venus. Both the Lion and the Sun symbolize life governed by heat, light, glamour, power and the glitter of the elite. Thus Leo-types are like triumphant odes sung to the accompaniment of sounding brass, aflame with the life force. The Leo-type corresponds to the high-powered character of the strong willed fanatic driven by the obsession to do. The love of action, that emotionally active strength, is controlled and directed towards a goal and subservient to long-term designs. A strong nature, inherently endowed with a full-blooded enjoyment of life, finds justification for existence by making the heavens ring with its achievements. This power can be expressed as horizontal deployment, as a Herculean type of efficiency, as physical presence, physical activity, the here and now. However, it may also be deployed in vertical tension and provide an Apollonian type of idealism, in which the powers of enlightenment tend to rule unrivalled.
Neptune on Nusakan(8^ H 30`) in the constellation of Beta Corona Borealis of the nature of Mercury and Venus. According to Ptolemy it is like Venus and Mercury. It is said to give artistic ability, love of flowers, lassitude and disillusionment, but to bring its natives to a position of command.
Pluto on Alula Boreala(06^ F 06`) in the constellation of Ursa Major and of the nature of Saturn and Venus. It is said to give a quiet, prudent, suspicious, mistrustful, self-controlled, patient nature, but an uneasy spirit and great anger when roused.
Rahu on Regulas (29^ E 20`) in the constellation of Alpha Leo and of the nature of Mars and Jupiter. It may convey royal properties, noble mind, frankness, courage. The importance of this star is accentuated by its nearness to the ecliptic. Its effect is in the best sense that of Jupiter and Mars.
The Fixed Stars and the sudden and violent death of the princess.
“Their romance ended abruptly on August 31, 1997 when both were killed in a car accident in Paris while fleeing from paparazzi.”.

Further, her Aquarian (Aquarius if the sign of Altruism) Moon marked her out as a true humanitarian, whose concern for others outweighed the suffering she endured in her own quest for emotional happiness. The Moon (the significator of the common man) is the dispositor of the Sun, in the 2nd house, aspecting Rahu (Rahu also signifying the outcast and deprived and people on whom death hovers- the people dying due to explosion of mines and aids patients). She fought for their rights and raised charity shows, thereby collecting funds and assistance of the rich and affluent and channelising for the necessities of the poor and deprived classes. This shows the sharing of royal glamour with people. Her Sun in Cancer spoke of an emotional, caring and sensitive woman with a great wealth of feeling and devotion to her loved ones, especially her children and showing sympathy for the common man. Princess Diana’s lion hearted and noble life was spent for the public, the common man, the people at large. She is the People’s princess who risked her royalty, happiness and even her life for their well-being.

The pre-eminent scientist in a century dominated by science.
The touchstones of the era — the Bomb, the Big Bang, quantum physics and electronics all bear his imprint
1879 (March 14) Born in Ulm, Germany, to Hermann Einstein (1847-1902) and Pauline Koch (1858-1920).
1880 Einsteins move to Munich..
1881 Sister Maja (Maria) born (d. 1951).

1901 Becomes Swiss citizen.
1902 Employed at patent office, Bern.
1903 Marries Mileva Maric (1875-1948). They have two sons, Hans Albert (1904-1973), who became a successful hydraulic engineer, and Eduard (1910-1965), who fell prey to incurable schizophrenia. A daughter, Lieserl (1902-?) was born before the marriage and apparently put up for adoption--her fate is unknown.
1905 Publishes in the Annalen der Physik: -Über einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristishen Gesichtspunkt, on the quantum of light and the photoelectric effect.
-Die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen, on Brownian motion of particles and atomic theory.
-Elektrodynamic bewegter Körper, the special theory of relativity.
-Ist die Trägheit eines Körpers von seinem Energieeinhalt abhängig?, equivalence of mass and energy.
Events in 1905January 6: Second anniversary of marriage to Mileva Maric.

The Times of Albert Einstin: It was a time when there was a revolution in science and technology. Quantum physics was making great inroads and changing the whole scenario in the West.Newtonian physics can suitably describe the orbit of the planets or the energy transformations during a game of pool, quantum physics describes how electrons surround the nucleus of the atom and other subatomic actions. Quantum physics tries to explain the behavior of even smaller particles. These particles are things like electrons, protons, and neutrons. At the age of 30, his Theory of Relativity and Quantum Mechanics set off a revolution in Physics.
It was also the time of suppression as the Nazis and Hitler threatened the world. Being a Jew and a victim to Hitler’s policies, he fled Germany in 1933 (Prior to this, he had to design the U-boat project for Germany.The U-505 is a German World War II Type-IXc Unterseeboot a submarine) and settled in the USA. In 1939, to counter Hitler’s Germany developing the atomic bomb, he inspired the Manhattan Project and paved the way for the new atomic weapon. After the devastation of Hiroshima and N agasaki, he devoted much of his time for nuclear arms control. He spent much of his time at the Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton University, New Jersey.

Effects Of Fixed Stars In The Birth Chart Of Albert Einstin:
Angles On The Fixed Stars:
Ascendant on Tejat Posterior (3^ D 36`), in the constellation of Gemini and of the nature of Mercury and Venus. According to Robson it gives energy, force, power, protection. According to Dr. Eric Morse it gives the ability to express ideas in reasonable and acceptable ways which win, because of their manifest intelligence.
He further adds that Al Hena with Tegat Posterior and Propus (Tegat Prior) entered Cancer 1349, 1621 and 1755 AD respectively. Each of these dates, within a year or two, was significant in the rise of European thought and literature from the Renaissance onwards.

Nadir on El Kophrah (01^ F 42`) in Ursa Major of the nature of Mars.
Descendant on Kaus Medius (2^ J 53`) in the constellation of Saggitarus and of the nature of Mercury and Mars. According to Ebertin this star promoters of idealistic and humane ideas, promoters of mental stimuli, enterprise and a sense of justice.
According to Dr. Erci Morse it conveys a sense of strength and flexibility combined and this often shows up in the charts of people who can put force behind their reasoning, yet be flexible.
The Culmination is on the stars that give inventions and discoveries in scientific field. of
Sadalmelek (2^ L 04`) in the constellation of Alpha Aquarius and of the nature of Saturn and Merury(a star indicating fame through inventions and discoveries in science and aviation.
B) Formalhaut (2^ L 09`) (a star indicating success as a scientist. Ebertin says a conjunction with Jupiter or on the MC will bring favor from dignitaries of the church. Tied up with either Sun or Moon, the influence of Fomalhaut is said to be quite marked
Other cusps on fixed stars:
IInd cusp on Gomeisa (20^ D 30`) in the constellation of Canis Major and of the nature of Mercury and Mars. Manilus, book 5 of Astronomica, 4th century AD describes the qualities of this stars by saying : “It bestows not hunting, but its weapons. To rear keen scented whelps and to tell their class by their pedigree, their qualities by their place of origin; to produce nets and huntin-spears tipped with strong points, and pliant shafts with knots smoothed out and to manufacture and sell at a profit whatever the art of hunting is likely to require.”
IIIrd cusp on Giansar (8^ E 37`) in the constellation of Lambda Draco and of the nature of Saturn and Mars. According to Ptolemy the bright stars are like Saturn and Mars. Draco gives an artistic and emotional but somber nature, a penetrating and analytical mind, much travel. It gives craft, ingenuity, and valor.
VIth cusp on Unukhalai(20^ H 22`) in the constellation of Alpha Serpens and of the nature of Saturn and Mercury. Serpens, is the same Snake that is found on the symbol of medicine worldwide, the staff of the god Mercury, the caduceus. The caduceus shows two snakes coiling around a central rod surmounted by two wings of the bird on top. Mercury placed his wand between two serpents struggling to devour each other, which represents the directing intelligence (Mercury) reconciling basic opposing forces and so representing good balanced by evil, health by sickness. A snake's ability to shed its skin is symbolic of transformation and renewal.
Kundalini is represented symbolically as a snake coiled up upon itself in the form of a ring at the base of the spinal column; and when it is roused, as sometimes happens in human experience, the snake uncoils and stretches up along the spinal column, through the chakras, corresponding to the various plexuses of the body, until it reaches the area of the forehead corresponding to the crown chakra, there it blazes out to enlightenment.

The snake represent power, wisdom, temptation, sublety, moral dualism, the harmonizing of divergent tendencies. The snake has often been likened to a bolt of lightning. There is no foretelling the snakes' movements, when a snake uncoils to strike, he moves like lightning.
This energy can bring about sudden changes.
VIIIth cusp on Sulaphat(20^ J 14`) (the star of science and art)in the constellation of Gamma Lyre and of the nature of Mercury and Venus. According to Ptolemy Lyra (a musical instrument) is like Venus and Mercury. It is said to give an harmonious, poetical and developed nature, fond of music and apt in science and art.
Luminaries on fixed stars:
The Sun on Sadalbari a)(22^ L 42`) and b) Matar(22^ L 42`) both in the constellation of Pegasus and of the nature of Mars and Mercury. Pegasus is indicative of a specific mission in life which the inquirer will always find the time and energy to pursue, although the path may be sewn with difficulties (the Chimaera) and limitations. Pegasus Syndrome is the seeming ability to "fly over any situation," though the reverse may be a lesson in humility, being "taken down a peg," as it were.
The Moon on Ras Algethi (14^ I 27`) in the constellation of Herculas and of the nature of Saturn. Ebertin says that this star gives boldness and a drive to gain power. If well aspected it is said to give enjoyment and favors from women. If badly aspected, it is said to cause irritation, especially in connection with the female sex. The Moon is influenced by
Rigel(15^ C 08) from opposition, the star indicating mechanical and inventive abilities and inventions.
Other Planets On Fixed Stars:
Mercury and Saturn are influenced through opposite rays a) Zanian (2^ G 50`) According to Ptolemy it is of the nature of Mercury and Venus; and, to Alvidas, of Venus and Mercury in
sextile. It gives refinement, honor, congeniality, order and a lovable nature b) Eadasich (3^
G 13`) in the constellation of Draco and of the nature of Saturn and Mercury. According to Ptolemy the bright stars are like Saturn and Mars. Draco gives an artistic and emotional but
somber nature, a penetrating and analytical mind, much travel and many frien c) Tueris (3^
G 30`) in the constellation of Argo Navis and of the nature of Saturn and Jupiter. According to Robson it gives prosperity in trade and voyages. Strength of mind and spirit.
Venus is influenced through opposite rays from Seginus (15^ G 58``) in the constellation of Gamma Bootes and of the nature of mercury and Saturn. Bootes symbolizes the elder, the sage, the wise old man who is interested in principles and underlying causes, theories, ideologies, and how the past effects the future. (Conservative) politicians, economists, draftsmen, architects, designers of all kinds. Manilius 1st century AD writes "they will be kings under kings and ministers of state, and be charged with the guardianship of the people,

custodianship of great houses and treasures, who confine their business to the care of another's home so that the wealth of monarchs and temple finances will be in their keeping". They are the master who works on the drawing board, where he casts the exact plan of the intended construction. Before taking form everything pre-exists as an abstract concept, as an intention, he represents the mysterious artisan, the drawn-up plan, the scaffold without which no vital construction could be made, the prototype putting the stamp of the species on the individual, the astral body of the occultist. He is the master capable of directing the work of others and of discerning what is in the embryo in the sphere of human development.
Mars is influenced through opposite rays by a) Polaris in the constellation of Ursa Major and of the nature of Saturn and Venus. Dr. Eric Morse says : Ptolemy gives it a Saturn-Venus rating entirely right for the star which serves so well to guide us in our wanderings and this is just what it tell us about people when we find it strong in their charts. According to its aspects, they are excellent, or not so good at, receiving and giving guidance, and give it they
always will and to any and all who will listen. and b) Betalguese (27^ C 03`) – a star indicating literary gifts, good leadership and organization and giving success in one’s career – in the constellation of Alpha Orion and of the nature of Mars and Mercury. Noonan says that it gives honors and titles.
Jupiter is influenced by the opposite raysof a)Algeiba(27^ E 54`) in the constellation of Gamma Leo and of the nature of Saturn and Mercury. According to Allen it promotes love,
benevolence, and help against enemies]. (Allen). And b) Regulas(28^ E 08`) – a star giving prominent leadership, optimism, position and authority. Among the lunar-mansion stars, it is chief in the Hindu 10th nakshatra that bears its name in India as Magha, "the Mighty". In Arabia, with gamma, zeta, and eta of the Sickle, it was the 8th manzil, Al Jabhah, the Forehead with the influences that strengthens buildings, promotes love, benevolence, and help against enemies. This is one of the four key stars in the heavens, also called archangel stars, assigning: Venant - Raphael The Healing Archangel (Regulus) Watcher of the North.
Uranus is influenced through opposite rays of Anch (1^ L 34) in the constellation of Theta Aquarius and is of the nature of Saturn and Mercury. According to Noonan this star along with Albali can cause danger, persecution and even death, but are also said to give good fortune.
Neptune is on Kafaljdhma (7^ B 44`) in the constellation of Cetus and of the nature of Saturn. It confers an emotional and charitable nature, with the ability to command, especially in war.
Pluto is on Algol (24^ B 28`) in the constellation of Beta Perseus and of the nature of Saturn and Jupiter. Algol is a star that is signified with evil. Pluto is signified with transformation and plutonomium, atoms, neutrons. Pluto is in the 12th house of secrecy. The secrets of splitting the atoms was developed by Einstin. He advised president Roosevelt to develop atomic weapons as Hitler was attempting to do so and the Manhattan Project saw the light of the day. Mars, with dignity but with retrained energy is in trine from the 8th to Pluto in the 12th. Both are planets of death and Pluto is the planet of total annihilation. The atomic

weapons used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki saw the total devastation of the cities. Perhaps, after the explosion of these weapons, he must have felt repentant as he advocated to stops the arms race after the war.
Rahu os on Bos(2^ K 28`) b)Al Shat (2^ K 14`) and Oculus 93Aqu01). According to Robson both are said to give piercing intellect.
Albert Einstin the scientist :
1. Has his ascendant fortified with energy, force, power, protection and the ability to express ideas in reasonable and acceptable ways which win, because of their manifest intelligence as the Ascendant on Tejat Posterior.
2. El Kophrah on his Nadir enables him to be a promoter of idealistic and humane ideas, promoters of mental stimuli, enterprise and a sense of justice at the last phase of his life.
3. The stars on his culmination gave made him a scientist full of inventions and discoveries and Formalhaut made him a successful scientist. The sixth and eighth cusps also give him the power of intuition and working for the progress of scientific discoveries and inventions.
4. The Sun on Sadalbar and Matar gave him a specific mission in life, an inquirer and a seeker. The Moon on Ras Algethi made him bold and gave him favours from the fair sex.
5. Mars is influenced by Betelguese with rays from opposite angle, enableing him have successful career. Mars is the lord of 11th, in 8th and trine to Pluto (on Algol – a star that signifies evil) in the 12th. Both deal with death and destruction. His assistance in building the U boats for Germany and splitting the atom for the USA were instrumental in bring mass destruction on the face of the earth. But such a combination also brought in a transformation so that during the last phase of his life (indicated by the nadir) he advocated a halt in the arms race.

Importance of “oppositions for Fixe Stars in the case of Albert Einstein
Many authorities on Fixed Stars like Vivian Robson and Reinhold Ebertin have concluded that the fixed stars operate by position and are said to "cast no rays" or, in other words, their aspects are said to be ineffective and their influence to be exerted only by conjunction and parallel. At the same time they also suggest that aspects to the fixed stars can be read, but it is only the opposition that is thought to be of any relevance. The opposition may exert some influence due to the polarity, but the conjunction is by far the primary aspect to consider.
The horoscope, when taken in its totality shows the following:
1. Ascendant cusp is onTejat Posterior, giving energy, force, power, protection according to Robson.. 2. The Culmination is on is on Sadalmelek and Formalhaut, and both the stars are concerned with science, technology, inventions and discoveries. 3. The Sun on Sadalbari and Matar and both these stars are indicative of a specific mission in life which the inquirer will always find the time and energy to pursue, although the path may be sewn with difficulties (the Chimaera) and limitations.
4. The Moon (Lord of the Ascendant) on Ras Algethi in the constellation of Herculas and of the nature of Saturn is in the sign of adventure, exploration, exresearch and the higher mind.. Further, the Moon forms a sextile with the IXthe cusp faling Aquarius , the most scientific sign. Ebertin says that this star gives boldness and a drive to gain power. The Moon is forming a trine with Venus and the XIth cusp, indicating fulfillment and success. The Moon is also quintile to the Lord of the IXth, Uranus, and this aspect is favourable for development of the mind and spirit. The Moon is part of the fan formation made by the Vth cusp to Moon (in the form of a semi-sextile), the Moon to the VIIth cusp (in the form a semi-sextile), the VIIth cusp to the IXth cusp (in the form a semi-sextile), the IXth cusp to the XIth cusp (in the form of a sextile). The Sextile involved in the very powerful fan formation involved the Ascendant and the Ascendant lord, is a power aspect of opportunities as emphasized by the German Cosmo biologists and Uranian astrologers.
5. In a similar manner another fan formation is formed by Mars (lord of the XIth) conjunct the VIIIth cusp by semi-sextile to Jupiter and a sextile to the Sun, Jupiter forms a semisextile to the Sun (in the Xth house) and the Sun forming a sextile to Pluto in the XIth house. Mars, lord of XIth is trine Pluto in the XIth. The Xth cusp is trine to the Ascendant.
6. Most of the planets are above the earth, adding impetus to his plans, aims, desires and ambitions related to his life and career.

7. Except the Sun in the element of water, most of the planets are either in fiery or earthy elements. This gives us a picture of a sensible man with great ambition and drive with strategies for fulfillment and success.
8. The point of Kamadhenu (the sum of the longitudes of the Ascendant, the Sun and the Moon) falls on 19D38.45 conjunct the Sun. They are both trine the Ascendant from the Culmaination (Karmasthan) by the translation of light.
Looking at the chart in the light of the above background, it would be right of say that opposition has exerted some influence due to polarity and this great soul made all attempts to seize all opportunities even in adversity and transform them through strategic planning into success. There are exceptions and anomalous phenomena in the plan of nature and creation, Albert Einstin is a part of nature’s plan and God’s creation. The hour cometh and the man cometh. He walked on the globe like a mighty intellect when there was a great revolution in the field of science and technology, His shadow crossed this path at a very critical juncture. His success story in the annals of history will remain a chapter that all civilized men will read and try to emulate. The stars are His handiwork. But mortal men who admire and try to emulate his success through fervent, ceaseless and untiring efforts in an environment of adversities will admit that the fixed stars do influence the affairs of human beings on this sub-lunar plane to some extent.

NO : 13 Mr. Mac
Some are born fortunate, some achieve it, while fate thrusts fortune on a few.
Born on 31 Aug 1970 @ 1.15 IST, 74E53 / 12N52
Joined a multinational company as a worker. As it was the practice of that company to recruit one son on seniority basis, Mac’s fathers turn came on seniority and Mac was employed in 1991.
Right from childhood he had an enjoyable life. Even seniority-wise, his elder brother was eligible for employment, but due to the prevailing circumstances Mac was lucky to be employed.
Somehow he became the favourite of the youngsters working in the Bhati (oven department) as he was working in that section. In the elections held in March 1994 he won with a very handsome margin, may be because the panel in which he joined was very powerful and all the 9 seats were won by the panel.
Soon, he became accustomed to the politics of the company and has been in leadership since then, till date. Grade-wise, an unskilled worker, but luck wise he is sitting with the management, framing police and taking decisions and hundreds of workmen (much elder than him) who worked along with him have to still give their sweat, blood and toil everyday.
He owns a spacious house, is married with two children. He has no problems concerning finance and has good investment. At this age he has planned very well for his future.
How The Fixed Stars Have Affect his life:
The Angles On Fixed Stars:
1.Ascendant on Sarph (25^ C 13`) in the constellation of Orion which will fashion alert minds and agile bodies, souls prompt to respond to duty's call, and hearts which press on
with unflagging energy in spite of every trial Wazan(25^ C 16`) in the constellation of Beta Columba, of the nature of Mercury and Venus. According to Robson it gives a gentle, kind, timid, innocent and self-sacrificing nature, together with strength of spirit. Bringers of good news.
2. Descendant on Aculeus(25^ I 10) in the constellation of Scorpius and of the nature of Mars and Moon. Eric Morse says that at their best, well aspected, they can have very sharp minds and a perception well above average as though, perhaps 'blind' to what we see and take for granted, they see what we do not, at levels where eyesight does not reach. Not for nothing has the word Acumen come down to us as a term for a sharp mind. Otherwise it can cause eye problems and blindness, if afflicted.

5. Culmination on Acamar (22^ A 51`) in the constellation of Theta Eridanus and of the nature of Jupiter. Robson says that according to Ptolemy all the stars with the exception of Achernar are like Saturn. Eridanus gives a love of knowledge and science, much travel and many changes, a position of authority, but danger of accidents, especially at sea, and of drowning
Other Cusps On Fixed Stars
IInd cusp on a)Muscida (21^ D 21`) in the constellation of Ursa Major and is of the nature of Mars. According to Robson it is said to give a quiet, prudent, suspicious, mistrustful, self-controlled, patient nature, but an uneasy spirit and great anger when roused.
b) Pollux (21^ D 25`) on Beta Gemini and of the nature of Mars. According to Ptolemy it is of the nature of Mars; and, to Alvidas, of the Moon, Mars and Uranus. It gives a subtle, crafty, spirited, brave, audacious, cruel and rash nature, a love of boxing, dignified malevolence, and is connected with poisons.
IIIrd cusp on a)Algenubi (18^ E 56`) in the constellation of Epsilon Leo and of the nature of Saturn and Mars. According to Robson it gives a bold, bombastic, cruel, heartless, brutish and destructive nature, but artistic appreciation and power of expression.
According to Noonan it gives an appreciation for language and a power of expression.
Ebertin says that it is credited with properties such as conveying higher spiritual gifts of the Logos to those men who are able to conceive them. In primitive natives, this star may become a danger, if bound up with a poorly placed Saturn or Neptune, severe psychological depressions are indicated and possibly even suicide. In conjunction with a 'strongly' placed Mars, the Lion's Head will make for feverish diseases and if conjunct with Uranus, dangers of accidents are present. Bismarck had this fixed star positioned exactly conjunct his Ascendant; this fact as well as the part played by other configurations gave this chancellor his mental superiority.
a)Merek (17^ E 31`) in the constellation of Usra Major and of the nature of Saturn and Mercury. Ebertin says that Merak has a Mars nature and is of importance in a natal chart, if the sign Leo is tenanted and other configurations give a clue to love of command and domination. This star is credited with increasing the power to get on in life and this is especially so if in conjunction with the Sun, Mars or Pluto.
Vth cusp on Spica (23^ G 25`) in the constellation of Alpha Virgo and of the nature of Venus and mercury. Robson says that according to Ptolemy it is of the nature of Venus and Mars; and, to Alvidas, of Venus, Jupiter and Mercury. It gives success, renown, riches, a sweet disposition, love of art and science, unscrupulousness, unfruitfulness and injustice to innocence. He further says that when Venus is on this star he gets benefits from friends, social success, false friends of own sex. Education does not imply just reading and mugging up from books. It is also experience got due to social contacts which develops the intellect.

Venus does give such intellectual development. The Hindus know it as Chitra, "Bright", their 14th nakshatra, figured as a Lamp, or as a Pearl, with Tvashtar, the Artificer, or Shaper, as its presiding divinity. [Influences: Those born on the lunar day will be mathematicians, surgeons, oculists, weavers, writers, singers, manufacturers of perfumes and dealers in jewels and cloth. With Moon transiting here at birth native will be fond of clothes and flowers of many colors and will have beautiful eyes and limbs. Allen says that a temple to this star in Greece erected in 715 B.C with reference to "the Great Diana of the Ephesians”. The native has all the positive and negative qualities referred. If he strives to suppress the negative qualities, then sky is the limit of his advancement.
VIIIth cusp on Sulaphat (21^ J 20`) in the constellation of Gamma Lyra and of the nature of Venus and Mercury. Manilus, book 5 of Astronomica, 1st century AD says that he will get to the bottom of crimes by sifting the evidence for them and bring to light - all that lies hidden under the silence of deceit. Hence, too, are begotten the merciless torturer, the dispenser of penalties, whoever insists on the truth and abominates evil, and the man whose profound understanding will put an end to disputes. Being a union leader and having being given an opportunity to grant justice, he can go into this direction to make the world a better place to live.
XIIth cusp on Algol(25^ B 45`) in the constellation of Beta Perseus and of the nature of Sturn and Jupiter. The people with the influence of Algol are Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, Van Gogh, Albert Einstein, Karl Abraham (psychoanalyst), Carl Jung, Ramakrishna (Indian saint), Muktananda (Indian mystic), Werner Erhard (guru "est"), Marshall Applewhite and Luc Jouret (cult leaders, led to mass suicides), Al Gore (the name is close), Billy Joel, Glen Campbell, Liberace, Princess Diana, Prince William, Princess Caroline of Monaco, Anita Bryant (against gays), Zola Budd (runner), Manly Palmer Hall (philosophical research), Aleister Crowley (Satanist, occultist), Erica Jong (author), Mary Jo Kopechne (drowned companion of Ted Kennedy), John Lennon, Ringo Starr, Dean Martin, Ryan O'Neil, Josef Stalin, Pat Schroeder, Carl Sagan, Cecil B. De Mille (film producer), Isadora Duncan, Mata Hari (Spy), George Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde, Michael Caine, Henry Fonda, Ruhollah Khomeini (Iranian leader), Stephen King (horror novels).
According to Robson it causes misfortune, violence, decapitation, hanging, electrocution and mob violence, and gives a dogged and violent nature that causes death to the native or others. It is the most evil star in the heavens As the star influences his XIIth cusp, with its lord Venus on a very fortunate star Spica in the fifth house, and the twelfth cusp making a quincunx to Venus, the native could be on the path of self undoing. But with the above examples of the great, it could also be the blessings of purva punya to conquer evil, as Venus is trine the ascendant.

The Luminaries On Fixed Stars
The Sun on Khambalia (6^ H 32`) in the constellation of Lambda Virgo and of the nature of Mercury and Mars. According to Robson it causes swift violence, unreliability, changeability, and an argumentative nature.
The Moon on Alphard (26^ E 13`) in the constellation of Alpha Hydra and of the nature of Saturn and Venus. Robson says that Ptolemy states that it is of the nature of Saturn and Venus, but according to Alvidas it is similar to the Sun and Jupiter in sextile. It gives wisdom, musical and artistic appreciation, knowledge of human nature, strong passions, lack of self control, immorality, revolting deeds and a sudden death by drowning, poison or asphyxiation.
There is always a struggle in man’s mind over good and evil, right and wrong. At times “Character is Destiny” and the human mind can triumph over negative factors and raise the soul to great heights, the heights of the heavens itself. Robson says if it is with the Moon then lust, wantonness, profligacy, failure in projects but financial help often from a relative, ill-fortune to wife or mother, eventual disgrace and ruin, danger of death by asphyxiation. If afflicted by Mars or Saturn, death by drowning or poison especially if Mars be angular. If a malefic is in conjunction with Algol; death by water or poison. The native should be extremely careful and tread the correct path.
Other planets on fixed stars
Mercury on Zavijava(26^ F 45`) in the constellation of Beta Virgo and of the nature of Mercury and Mars. According to Robson it gives beneficence, force of character, strength, combative movements and destructiveness. The importance is emphasized as Mercury is the lord of the ascendant.
Venus on Spica (23^ G 25`) – the details of Spica have already been given above.
Venus on Arcturus (23^ G 49`) in the constellation of Alpha Bootes and of the nature of Mars and Jupiter. Allen says astrologically the star brought riches and honor to those born under it. Robson says when it is on Venus, it makes one popular, gifts and favors from friends, some false friends of own sex. Ebertin says that between Spica and Arcturus there is only a minor difference in longitude but a very large difference in latitude. A blend of mutual influences is frequently given. Although Spica is very much larger and will dominate, it may get more positive character by its blending with Arcturus.
Venus on Nekkar(23^ G 50`) in the constellation of Beta Bootes and of the nature of Mercury and Saturn. Manilius 1st century AD writes "they will be kings under kings and ministers of state, and be charged with the guardianship of the people, custodianship of great houses and treasures, who confine their business to the care of another's home so that the wealth of monarchs and temple finances will be in their keeping".



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 259 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
Mars on Al Jabbah (27^ E 09`) in the constellation of Eta Leo and of the nature of Saturn and Mercury. According to Robson that this star gives loss and many dangers, a violent and in temperate nature, and to a military officer danger of mutiny and murder by his soldiers. These characteristics are most marked when the star is rising.
Jupiter on Princeps a)(2^ H 44`) in the constellation of Delta Bootes and of the nature of Mercury and Saturn. Robson says that it gives a keen studious and profound mind with the ability for research.
b) Jupiter on Akalurops(2^ H 46`) in the constellation of Bootes and of the nature of Mercury and Saturn. The star in the constellation is said to give prosperity from work, strong desires, a tendency to excess, a fondness for rural pursuits, together with some liking for occultism.
Saturn on Zaurak (23^ B 27`) in the constellation of Eridanus and of the nature of Saturn. Ebertin says Zaurak has a Saturnian character. Anyone who has this star connected with a planet in his chart should endeavor not to take life too seriously and put too much weight on everything people say. This person should struggle to overcome melancholy. Otherwise, this star could trigger off fear of death and suicidal tendencies.
Neptune on Toliman(Bangula)(29^ H 04`) in the constellation of Centaurus and is of the nature of Venus and Jupiter. According to Ptolemy it is of the nature of Venus and Jupiter; and, to Alvidas, of Mars with the Moon and Uranus in Scorpio. It gives beneficence, friends, refinement and a position of honor.
Pluto on Alkaid (26^ F 31`) According to Ptolemy it is of the nature of Venus and Jupiter; and, to Alvidas, of Mars with the Moon and Uranus in Scorpio. It gives beneficence, friends, refinement and a position of honor.
In the native’s chart the lord of the ascendant is conjunct Pluto and trine Saturn. With a steady mind on the path of spiritual development the native transform himself to the great men and women mentioned above under the influence of Algol, and society would benefit a great deal from it.

- caught on the wheels of fate in the reverse.
Born on 26th June 1942 at 02.45 IST 75E00 and 12N20
The native was running an educational institute for more than 2 decades in the suburbs of Mumbai. Prior to this he was a manager of another educational institute in Mumbai for a decade.
His charts shows that his ascendant and ascendant lord Venus is strong, trine to his 11th lord Neptune tenanting the fifth, the sign of service. Apart from running the institute he was involved in social service, both political and non-political.
Mercury, lord of IInd (having dignity is in the second). The lord of IXth (Saturn)and Xth(Uranus) are conjunct in the ascendant (aspect wise and declination wise). By parallels of declination Mercury is conjunct Saturn. Therefore, there is a powerful combination. Further Jupiter (though combust), lord of VIIIth is conjunct the Sun (lord of 4th), (strengthened by the parallel of declination) tenanting the IInd house. By this combination, so far as income was concerned, it was through Mercurial matters, detached communication, commission agent, etc. The trine effect of Saturn and Uranus to the VIth cusp and Meridian cusp also makes the native to indulge odd types of occupations dealing with service-oriented sector through human contacts.
The Moon, lord of 3rd house, signifying kindred, domestic matters, females and the general public at large, has lost its dignity and is in opposition to his ascendant and ascendant lord from the descendant. This Moon is almost square to the Sun and Jupiter, bringing in problems with contractual documents and the government authorities. It was through the problems created by people at large and his kindred that his 55th and 56th years were very troublesome, where he was forced to sell his house (in the 55th year) and surrender his business and business premises (in the 56th year). The present exercise is an attempt to see how the progressed and solar return charts of his 56th year vis-à-vis his ntal chart was affected by aspects, transits of planets and fixed stars. Time and again, I repeat that effects of fixed stars should be seen along with other combinations of the charts in totality.

During the 54th year of the native, his younger brother came from the middle-east with new plans and ideas of exporting labourers of various categories and earning commission through agents. The deal went on well for some months. After that problems after problems occurred and the money taken in advance was already in the hands of the chief agent stationed at Delhi. He backed out very slyly. The amount increased into an astronomical

sum. As the native was a part of the deal because the office was put up in his premises, he was in deep trouble. To solve the problem for the time being, he sold his house in th 55th year and made part payment. But troubles come in heaps and these few lakshs were not enough to solve the repayment. At the same time, troubles increased by leaps and bounds and the court case against his business premises went against him and it was a rare case in the history of tenancy rights that he had to surrender it (turned into a residence-cum-business premise) in the 56th year.

Antares causes malevolence, evil presages and dangers of fatility; makes the native rash, headstrong with destructive tendencies. Aldabaren, apart from giving intelligence, courage, ferocity, etc., it gives danger of violence and sickness. From Jan 1999 onwards the native had to face dangerous situations at the cost of lhis life and money. To face such a hopeless situation, he too had to becomes bold and summon courage and use threatening language. The people after his blood used to send unruly elements and “goondas” to achieve their purpose.

He had shift to an unpleasant rental apartment with his wife and three children who were still going to school He was without any daily income and his domestic and social problems were pushing him to the wall. The blows of fate were hard and cruel. The native was caught on the quick sands of time and he was counting every moment that was flowing down through the hour glass of time. He was praying to deliverance from this cup overflowing with dejection, despair and doom with the possibility of death.

- he loves that name.
Born on 18th May 1966 at 1.44 IST 80E17 and 13N05.
Efforts in changing his attitude did pay rich dividends, but now the native has slipped back to his old habits.
The native has Pisces rising and it’s lord Neptune is trine to the ascendant and Saturn (in the ascendant). After going to hundreds of astrologers, his psychic abilities were shown to him in 1998. He took it seriously and read material from William Lily, Robson, Krishnamurthi, took advise from the professors of Bharatya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. He grasped the subjects of Sayana, Nirayana, Krishnamurthi Padathi and fixed stars.
He lives with his parents who are disciplined and loveable and has a brother who is working in the media industry. Richard worked in the Pharma industry as a manager for 10 years. Later on he switched over to the media industry.
Some Facts Of His Life:
1. The native was away from his parents from the age of 3 to 17. During this period he lived with his maternal uncle.
2. During the period 1984-86 he was selling papads, chakli, and other home made items to meet the daily needs of the family.
3. He came to Bombay and made his career in the pharma industry from 1986 to 1996.
4. Joined the media industry in 1997.
5. Marrigae on 20th Jan 1997 and was separted from his wife on 5.4.1998.
6. Was jobless from 2001 to 2004. During this period he was getting jobs on commission basis.

Some basic features of his chart. The conjunction of his ascendant on Saturn and they both trine to Scorpio (due to the translation of light from Neptune) brings in Psychic development. But this Psychic development came in only after his marriage went on the rocks in 1999. The transformation came in due to Uranus and Pluto conjunct the VIIth cusp and sextile Neptune in the VIIIth (in Scorpio). Neptune is in the sign of Pluto and this disaster is actually a blessing to him, in so far as enlightenment dawned on him. Prior to that he use to abuse astrology and astrology. Today, after a painful transformation, he says that astrology is a science.
Mars is on the 3rd cusp, also lord of 2nd. He has got daring, both through his tongue and physical prowess. This daring has saved him from many dangers in life. Further Sun is on Algol (26 Taurus) again the third house. Every year, when the Sun used to transit Algol, the native confessed that he would be in violent and destructive mood. After learning astrology and the fixed stars, the use of caution and restrain has changed much of his attitude. During the last 3 years he has avoided violence, though with great difficulty.
The main reason of including Richard’s chart is that there is a great transformation in him after learning astrology and he is become more reasonable and sensible. This proves that free will can change character to some extent and thereby make us better human beings and improving our karmas. After all, it is the soul and its good karmas that will last, leaving the mortal remains to be consigned to the elements.
Effects of fixed stars in the chart of Richard
Angles on the fixed stars:
1. Ascendant on Homam (15^ L 40`) in the constellation of Alpha Pegasis and of the nature of Mars and Mercury. The constellation gives ambition, vanity, intuition, enthusiasm, caprice and bad judgment. The native also possesses the Pegasus Syndrome, which is concerned with the innate ability possessed by some people to negotiate difficulties by rising above them, on the one hand, and the danger of overreaching themselves,Robson says that according to Ptolemy it is of the nature of Mars and Mercury; to Simmonite, of Mars and Venus; and, to Alvidas, of Jupiter in square to Mercury with Saturn from Pisces and Gemini. It gives honor, riches, fortune, danger from fevers, cuts, blows, stabs [can be operations nowadays] and fire and a violent death. The native has a dual character like the ascendant and he can surprise people in doing things. Further, injuries to him were his constant companion.
2. VIIth cusp falls on Mizar in the constellation of Zeta Ursa Major and is of the nature of Saturn and Venus, Further, the VIIth cusp is conjunct Uranus and Pluto, both in opposition to the Ascendant but trine to their dispositor, Mercury. Ebertin says that in personal charts Mizar is not helpful if conjunct with 'bad' planets. It is not wrong to assume that, besides these handicaps, artistic emanations can also be attributed to Mizar. Noonan says that it presages the death of a loved one. Ebertins interpretations of the



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 268 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
VIIth cusp is absolutely correct as he has suffered from many disasters so far as the 7th house matters and oppositions are concerned.
3. Culmination on Maasym (19^ I 36`) in the constellation of Lambda Hercules and of the nature of Mercury. According to Ptolemy it is like Mercury. It is said to give strength of character, tenacity and fixity of purpose, an ardent nature and dangerous passions. At the moment these dangerous passions outweigh his good qualities bringing to naught his talents and efforts.
Other cusps on fixed stars:
Second cusp on Baiten Kaitosh (21^ A 27`) in the constellation of Cetus and of the nature of Saturn.
Ebertin says that the Whale really means "monster". The Saturnine properties, such as inhibition, reserve, caution, solitude and simplicity are often forced onto such people, either by a mundane power or a higher power. Sometimes ideas are propagated which make life for the native trying or troublesome. To such persons, fate is usually one of change. People influenced thus, tend to depression or dwell on the thought of death. Life often is full of humiliation, renunciation and obstacles. But the position of the complete chart is always important.
Fifth cusp is on Sirus (13^ D 40`) in the constellation of Canis Major and of the nature of Jupiter and Mars. According to Ptolemy it is of the nature of Jupiter and Mars and, to Alvidas, of the Moon, Jupiter and Mars. It gives honor, renown, wealth, ardor, faithfulness, devotion, passion and resentment, and makes its natives custodians, curators and guardians.
The native has benefitted to a great extent from females through love affairs.
Sixth cusp on a)Kochab (12^ E 50`) in the constellation of Ursa Minor and of th nature of Saturn and Jupiter. According to Robson it is said to give indifference and improvidence of spirit and to lead to many troubles.
b)It is also on Acubens or Seretain (13^ E 10`) in the constellation of Alpha Cancer and of the nature of Saturn and Mercury. According to Robson it gives activity, malevolence and poison, making its natives liars and criminals. These negative tendencies are inborn tendencies in the native. Lies, my God. He could make you believe that it is night even in the daylight. Criminal tendencies – he could bite the hand that feeds him. He could climb on your shoulder to get out of a ditch but then say good bye and leave you in peril. Less said the better.
The ninth cusp is on Unikalhai (21^ H 38`) in the constellation of Serpens and of the nature of Saturn and Mercury. Serpens, is the same Snake that is found on the symbol of medicine worldwide, the staff of the god Mercury, the caduceus. The caduceus shows two snakes coiling around a central rod surmounted by two wings of the bird on top. Mercury placed his wand between two serpents struggling to devour each other, which represents the directing intelligence (Mercury) reconciling basic opposing forces and so representing good balanced

by evil, health by sickness. This much-used image is an emblem of homeopathy - a cure effected by what caused the ailment. The serpent therefore becomes the source of the healing of the wound caused by the serpent.
A snake's ability to shed its skin is symbolic of transformation and renewal.
Kundalini is represented symbolically as a snake coiled up upon itself in the form of a ring at the base of the spinal column; and when it is roused, as sometimes happens in human experience, the snake uncoils and stretches up along the spinal column, through the chakras, corresponding to the various plexuses of the body, until it reaches the area of the forehead corresponding to the crown chakra, there it blazes out to enlightenment.
The snake represent power, wisdom, temptation, sublety, moral dualism, the harmonizing of divergent tendencies.
The snake has often been likened to a bolt of lightning. There is no foretelling the snakes' movements, when a snake uncoils to strike, he moves like lightning. This energy can bring about sudden changes.
The will and determination of man has from time to time brought in transformation. Even Valia Koli could be transformed into the great sage Valmiki through yoga and tapasya. The power of kunalini brings in super consciousness if properly harnessed.
The eleventh cusp is on Vega (14^ J 51`) in the constellation of Alpha Lyra and of the nature of Mercury and Venus. According to Ptolemy it is of the nature of Venus and Mercury; and, to Alvidas, of Saturn in trine to Jupiter from the earthy signs especially Capricorn and Taurus. It gives beneficence, ideality, hopefulness, refinement and changeability, and makes its natives grave, sober, outwardly pretentious and usually lascivious.
In a good cosmic configuration, Vega is supposed to give artistic talents especially for music and acting, but also a liking for good living. With eccentric artists, this may lead to a debauched life.
The twelfth cusp is on Armus (12^ K 18`) in the constellation of Capricornus and of the nature o f Mars and Mercury. According to Robson this star It gives disagreeableness, contemptibleness, instability, shamelessness, nagging and a troublesome and contentious nature.
The Luminaries On Fixed Stars
The Sun (conjunct Rahu) is on Algol (25^ B 42`) in the constellation of Beta Perseus and of the nature of aturn and Jupiter. Ancient Arabs thought it was spooky, and called the star Algol, or Al-Ghul (1), which means "The Ghoul" or "Demon Star", and Ri'B al Ohill, the "Demon's Head". It is said to have been thus called from its rapid and wonderful variations. Algol is the most famous of the eclipsing variables and the only one known of in ancient times. This behavior was attributed to a pulsing eye of the Gorgon Medusa. "the Gorgon's

head, a ghastly sight, deformed and dreadful, and a sight of woe" The Hebrews knew Algol as Rosh ha Sitan, "Satan's Head", or "the Devil's Head"; also as Lilith, Adam's legendary first wife, believed to have been in existence before the creation of Eve. She is believed to be the nocturnal vampire from the lower world. According to R.H. Allen, the Chinese gave it the gruesome title Tseih She, the "Piled-up Corpses". Astrologers say that it was the most unfortunate, violent, and dangerous star in the heavens. Alfred Pearce says that “it is the most evil star in the heavens”. Stars that are classified as evil always have powerful significance: In the The Lost Light Alvin Boyd Kuhn says Algol is identified with the Egyptian Khu or spirit (Algol is a word related to alcohol - spirits). It gives an intelligent, strong, bold and adventurous nature, but a tendency to lying. According to Robson it causes misfortune, violence, decapitation, hanging, electrocution and mob violence, and gives a dogged and violent nature that causes death to the native or others. It is the most evil star in the heavens. Ebertin comments: Poor teeth. Brutality and violence. Arabic commanders in chief, in times of conquest, made it a point that no important battles were begun when the light of Algol was weak (Algol is an eclipsing binary - every 68 hours and 49 minutes the demon ‘blinks’ for roughly 8 hours as the dimmer star of the pair passes between the brighter and the earth).
With so much said about Algol, great celebrities too have this fixed star in their charts.Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, Van Gogh, Albert Einstein, Karl Abraham (psychoanalyst), Carl Jung, Ramakrishna (Indian saint), Muktananda (Indian mystic), Werner Erhard (guru "est"), Marshall Applewhite and Luc Jouret (cult leaders, led to mass suicides), Al Gore (the name is close), Billy Joel, Glen Campbell, Liberace, Princess Diana, Prince William, Princess Caroline of Monaco, Anita Bryant (against gays), Zola Budd (runner), Manly Palmer Hall (philosophical research), Aleister Crowley (Satanist, occultist), Erica Jong (author), Mary Jo Kopechne (drowned companion of Ted Kennedy), John Lennon, Ringo Starr, Dean Martin, Ryan O'Neil, Josef Stalin, Pat Schroeder, Carl Sagan, Cecil B. De Mille (film producer), Isadora Duncan, Mata Hari (Spy), George Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde, Michael Caine, Henry Fonda, Ruhollah Khomeini (Iranian leader), Stephen King (horror novels).
Finally, the interpretations of the chart should be done in its totality. Modern interpretations ought to be given so far as cruelty or autocratic behaviour, power commanded, etc. For Cecil B. De Mille (film producer) had such a great clout that no celebrity could refuse to go against him. Josef Stalin was all powerful and by the use of terror tactics there was fear in the mind of the people to go against him.
Even in the present case, the native admits that he was very violent, and at times it was detrimental to him and the people involved in his personal matters or vive versa. There was even physical injury and damage of property. These things were continuous affairs even upto the year 2000. But conscious efforts for restraint, caution and suppression of the thought of violence can bring about a change in attitude. The time, the environment, culture and outside influence do influence people. In the instant case the native had a change of attitude during the last 3 years to some extent because of intellectual refinement and sobering influence on his mind. Violent attitude cannot be eliminated, but surely reduced and suppressed. Further, the Sun on Algol falls in the 3rd house, dealing with kindred, travel, correspondence, writing, adventure. Violence and violent language was there all throughout his life. Adventure was accompanied by fist blows too. He is still considered a

terror to his kindred and neighbourhood. Further, the status of a person also count. If a person is in a commanding position, surely he can exert his authority and brutality (in any form) on a large populace. In the case of Stephen King, brutality and violence was a matter of the mind. This angry young man can transform himself only when he subdues his ego. Otherwise, these temporary efforts may not fetch good results in the long run as per my observation.
The Moon is on Al Pherg (26^ A 20`) in the constellation of in the constellation of Eta Pisces and of the nature of Saturn and Jupiter. Dr. Eric Morse in “The Living Star”
comments: this star crossed the Aries point (0^ A) just at the time of the discovery of the planet Neptune in 1846 A.D., which was so soon to be recognized as co-ruler of Pisces along with Jupiter. The origins of the Babylonian name is obscure now, but it was long thought to be "Cord of the Fish". There is good reason, however, to interpret this as "Home of the Fish". This brings to mind the Sagittarian star Nunki (Pelagus), "the voice from the Sea" symbolizing guidance. Robson says it denotes preparedness, steadiness, determination and final success. Noonan says it indicates cuccess through determination. Despite heavy odds and hurdles, the native is determined in life and has set a deadline for 2007 that he will be a very successful person commanding men and resources. But that determination should be backed by patience, applied intelligence, perserverance and steadfastness. Other configurations of the chart count to a great extent. His third house is tenanted by the Sun, Mars and Rahu. The sun and Rahu are on Algol. They are opposed by his ascendant lord Neptune in Scorpio. Neptune in Scorpio can either make a person a saint or a sinner; a drug addict or a person of very high intelligence and deep study. Mr. Richards, please remember that delusions, violence, terror tactics and fist blows cannot make a person successful in the long run. Great dictators and men of terror all over the world have been wiped out throught the annals of history. If atomic energy can be channelised for constructive purposes, then human vibrations through yoga and tapasya can transform a person with super consciousness.
Other Planets On Fixed Stars:
Venus on Alphertz (13^ A 50`) in the constellation of Alpha Andromeda. According to Robson it makes a person fond of pleasure and society, fortunate for speculation. Saturn is
on Azalfafage (27^ L 44`) in the constellation of Cygnus and of the nature of Venus and Mercury. Robson says that Cygnus gives a contemplative, dreamy, cultured and adaptable nature. The affections are ill regulated and unsteady, the talents develop late. There is some love of water and swimming and the arts.
Uranus and Pluto are on a)Alcor (15^ F 23`) in the constellation of Ursa Major and of the nature of Mars. According to Robson it is said to give a quiet, prudent, suspicious, mistrustful, self-controlled, patient nature, but an uneasy spirit and great anger when roused.
b) Uranus and Pluto also fall on Mizar in the constellation of Ursa Major and of the nature of Saturn and Venus. Apart from the general characteristics of the constellation, accoridnto Ebertin in personal charts Mizar is not helpful if conjunct with 'bad' planets. It is not wrong to assume that, besides these handicaps, artistic emanations can also be attributed to Mizar.



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 272 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
In the instant case Mizar is connected with Uranus and Pluto on the seventh cusp. Matters relating to the seventh house have never been helpful to the native. On the contrary, the native has created problems for one and all, for years on, and from 1988 till date they are pending settlement.
The chart of Richard, though having good qualities and potentials for a good life, shows that negative qualities of a king-sized ego, passions, cruelty, delusion, etc. outweigh them. The feeble attempts to improve have not paid much results. He has slipped back to his own habits and life style. It is a sad story that all my efforts to bring him to the mainstream of life have failed, though with some good results for 3 years.
Some events in progression:
1.His progressed ascendant has touched 1^ B, which gives a superimposed profile of being practical and determined. But all these traits are being utilized in a very negative manner for greed, selfishness and fulfilling desires of self and vainglory.
2. In 1997-98, his progressed ascendant was near 23^A00 and progressed descendant was progressing towards Spica and Arcturus. During that period he was in the depths of depression and in the wilderness of life.(Refere point No.7 in the brief biographical sketch). At that time he was very lucky to find a partner who fell in love with him and they contemplated to marry later. Her love, affection and attachment was so deep for him that she faced innumerable difficulties for him and suffered a lot to see him happy. Richard confessed to me time and again, that during this short span she assisted him financially to the tune of one lakh rupees and was very faithful to him. While accompanying him for his court case of divorthe young pleaded with me take good care of him
3.Coincidentally, in 1994-95, when the progressed descendant (which also indicates contracts and partnership deals) was around 20^G00., near Foramen, coinciding with the degree of assassination, as pointed out by Prof. Gopal Modi, one of his partnership deals in the Pharma industry came to an end and at that time he had an hair-breathescape from being assassinated. This escape was possible due to his daring (Mars conjunct third cusp) and presence of mind.

NO: 16 THE MIGHTY ONE
The native is born on 22nd July 1944 at 8.20 IST 72e50 18N58.
This case study is named The Mighty One because Jupiter falls Regulas or Magha as per Yogatara. As Regulas is a royal star of 1 magnitude, it’s effect is also felt on the ascendant taking the orb of 2 1⁄2 degrees for such stars. Magha, as per Hindu astrology is known as The Mighty One.
In 1986 the native approached me for a reading of his birth chart. It was very crucial for him as he had already taken his decision to contest the municipal elections. He lost the elections by a margin of 200 votes and was bankrupt.
Later on, time and again he approached me. I told him that his timing was wrong. The time mentioned in his horoscope was 9.20 IST. He was born during the War time. Like other countries of the British Emprie, the IST was put one hour in advance with the sole aim to utilize the evening time for better purposes of war. Hence any birth time during the period 1st September 1942 to 15th October 1945 recorded according to the clock should be reduced by one hour at the equivalent IST.
According to the rectified time, his ascendant falls on 27^ E 12, in the last navamsa of Leo. The navamsa ascendant wil be Saggitarus and Jupiter who is placed in the ascendant of the natal chart will have essential dignity in the navamsa as it will also be placed in the navamsa ascendant. The ascendant of the decanate will be Aries and Jupiter will also be in the ascendant of the decanate chart. Further, Mars is conjunct Jupiter in the ascendant of the Radical chart degreecally. There is also a mutual reception between the ascendant lord, the Sun and the lord of the XIIth, the Moon, in the XIIth house. There is conjunction of 4 planets in the sign of Leo (fire), ie., Mercury, the Moon, Ascedant and Jupiter, due to the translation of light.
The native won his first election and became a corporator on 22nd Feb 1992. He joined politics at the age of 34 when his progressed ascendant went to 0o Libra. A new phase of life started. Around February 1991 he built a temple in the name of India’s most popular saint, the Sai Baba of Shirdi. Even today, on the anniversary day of temple, every year, lakhs of devotees pay homage to the saint at this temple. They come from all over Maharashtra and even from outside the state. Since then the native has never looked back. His contacts grew to the top level in Maharashtra and he won his first election with a thumping majority and became a corporator on 22nd Feb 1992. He has been winning elections ever since.
This case study shows that the fixed stars do influence the fate of people who are supposed to be gone cases. His name was a terror in the “ urb prima indis” and hence was externed from the city, His relations with the law enforcement authorities was very bad.

W.J. Gordon says that the degree 27^ E has the sign of “ a dagger, an ominous sign, danger at the hands of an enemy or reverse; restless and destructive, to attack, oppose, goes through life like a tornado; a degree of destroying.”
At the same time, the degree of the M.C. 27 Taurus on Capul Algol is indicating “daydreaming if mental conditions are not developed in the early youth; indications of becoming indifferent to surroundings; rather vain, desire for ease and luxury; very little ambition; however a long and fortunate life is denoted. A degree of success.” Pluto (Lord of IVth) is conjunct Venus(lord of Xth) in the royal sign but in the XIIth house. Has this combination transformed him when he was in the wilderness of life till the age of 48 years and made him construct the temple. Pluto is also conjunct Jupiter through the translation of light and Jupiter is also conjunct Mars (degreecally but out of sign). At the same time, Jupiter aspects the Vth house (its own sign, the natural Xth house of zodiac relating to religion and philosophy, etc. and the IXth house of his birth chart owned by Mars.
The Effect Of The Fixed Stars On The Native’s Life:
Fixed Stars on the Angles
1. The Ascendant falls on Al Jabbah in the constellation of (27^ E 12`) in the constellation of Eta Leo and of the nature of Mercury and Saturn. Robson says that It gives loss and many dangers, a violent and in temperate nature, and to a military officer danger of mutiny and murder by his soldiers. These characteristics are most marked when the star is rising. Such an interpretation was prevailing upon the native before 1986. Allen says that in Arabia this star Al Jabbah (eta) along with Adhafera (zeta) with Regulus (Alpha) and Algieba (gamma), were the Arabic 8th manzil, Al Jabhah, the "Forehead" with the influence to promotes love, benevolence, and help against enemies. After 1986, there was a change in the attitude and style of operation and the native’s character changed to Allen’s interpretation.
2. The nadir is on Bungala (27^ H 56`) in the constellation of Alpha Centaurus and of the nature of Venus and Jupiter. Toliman or Bungula is the Alpha star of the constellation Centaurus and the third largest star in the sky. Rigilkent or Rigil Kentaurus, are common names from the Arabic Rijl Qanturus or Al Rijl al Kentaurus, "Foot of the centaur”. According to Robson the nature of this constellation is said to give hard-heartedness, inclination to vengeance, love of arms, strong passion, and an energetic nature. It may be connected with poisons. Such was the nature of the native prior to 1986. But then after 1986 the characteristics of the star started prevailing upon the native. In the words of Robson, who says that according to Ptolemy it is of the nature of Venus and Jupiter; and, to Alvidas, of Mars with the Moon and Uranus in Scorpio. It gives beneficence, friends, refinement and a position of honor. As this star falls on his nadir, it shows a time period around the age of 60 and thereafter, that is the current period.

3. a)His Meridian falls on Nissam (27^ B 53`) in the constellation of Kappa Perseus and of the nature of Saturn and Mercury. Noonan says that when prominent in a natal chart it is said to denote adventurous individuals, but also those who are less than honest in their dealings with others.
The Other Cusps On Fixed Stars:
The IInd cusp is on Labrum(25^ F 53`) in the constellation of Delta Crater and of the planetary nature of Venus and Mercury. According to Robson this constellation gives a kind, generous, cheerful, receptive, passionate and hospitable nature with good mental abilities, but subject to apprehension and indecision. There is a disordered life full of sudden and unexpected events, and great danger of unhappiness, but usually some eminence According to Robson this star gives ideality, psychic power, intelligence, honor and riches in disgrace and purifies to salvation.
The IIIrd cusp is on Izar (26^ G 17`) in the constellation of Epsilon Bootes and of the planetary nature of Mercury and Saturn. According to Robson this constellation "It is said to give prosperity from work, strong desires, a tendency to excess, a fondness for rural pursuits, together with some liking for occultism
The Vth cusp is on Acumen (27^ I 56`) in the constellation of M7 Scorpius and of the planetary nature of Moon and Mars.According to Robson it affe cts the eyesight. Dr. Eric Morse says that the natives can have very sharp minds and a perception well above average as though, perhaps 'blind' to what we see and take for granted, they see what we do not, at levels where eyesight does not reach. Not for nothing has the word Acumen come down to us as a term for a sharp mind.
The XIth cusp on Betelguese (27^ C 56`) in the constellation of Alpha Orion and of the planetary nature of Mars and Mercury. Robson says that the constellation is said to give a strong and dignified nature, self-confidence, inconstancy, arrogance, violence, impiety, and prosperity in trade and particularly in voyages or abroad, but danger of treachery and poison.
The star Betelguese gives martial honor, preferment and wealth.according to Robson. According to Ebertin it gives everlasting fame.
Luminaries On Fixed Stars:
1. The Sun is on Aludra (29^ D 44`) in the constellation of Eta Canis Major of the nature of Venus. It is said to give good qualities, charity and a faithful heart, but also violent and dangerous passions.
2. The Moon falls on Algenubi (Ras Elasid Aust) (19^ E 55`) in the constellation of Epsilon Leo and of the nature of Saturn and Mars. Robson says that it gives a bold, bombastic, cruel, heartless, brutish and destructive nature, but artistic appreciation and power of expression, whereas Noonan says that it gives an appreciation for



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 277 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
language and a power of expression. Ebertin is of the opinion that “ Credited with properties such as conveying higher spiritual gifts of the Logos to those men who are able to conceive them. In primitive natives, this star may become a danger, if bound up with a poorly placed Saturn or Neptune, severe psychological depressions are indicated and possibly even suicide. In conjunction with a 'strongly' placed Mars, the Lion's Head will make for feverish diseases and if conjunct with Uranus, dangers of accidents are present. Bismarck had this fixed star positioned exactly conjunct his Ascendant; this fact as well as the part played by other configurations gave this chancellor his mental superiority.
There is a mutual reception between the Sun and Moon in the XIIth house. Both the stars upon which the Sun and Moon fall talk about brutish and destructive nature and violence, which were prevalent before the year 1986 and also of charity, artistic appreciation and power of expression which started blooming after 1992. As the luminaries are in the XIIth house, it is felt that after the act of self undoing and wandering about in the wilderness of life his violent, destructive and dangerous qualities had given way to these good qualities, in the solitude of isolations where the occult experiences (XIIth house) must have vibrated time and again in his mind (the Moon) and soul (the Sun). During this period the native acquired a lot of knowledge on religon, mysticism and mythology and some knowledge of astrology.
The Planets On Fixed Stars:
Jupiter conjunct the Ascendant (conjunct also Mercury-lord of 2 and 11, the Moon- lord of XII, Venus – lord of Xth and IIIrd, Pluto –lord of 4th, all through the translation of light and also Mars degreecally though out of sign) falls on:
a) Algieba (28^ E 47`) in the constellation of Gamma Leo and of the nature of Saturn and Mercury. According to Allen In Arabia, this star, Algieba (gamma), along with Adhafera (zeta), Regulus (Alpha) and eta (Al Jabbah) were the 8th manzil, Al Jabhah, the "Forehead" promoting love, benevolence, and help against enemies.
b)Regulas (29^ E 01`) in the constellation of Alpha Leo, of the nature of Mars and Jupiter. In Euphratean astronomy it was Gus-ba-ra, "the Flame", or "the Red Fire", of the House of the East; in Khorasmia, Achir, "Possessing Luminous Rays".
Among the lunar-mansion stars, it was chief in the Hindu 10th nakshatra that bore its name in India as Magha, "the Mighty".
In Arabia it was Malikiyy, "Kingly"; and Al Kalb al Asad, "the Heart of the Lion"
Robson said it was symbolically called "The Crushing Foot".
It was one of the four stars of the ancient Persian monarchy, in 3000 BC, when as watcher of the north it marked the summer solstice. It was seen as one of the Four Guardians of Heaven; one who regulated all things in the heavens; sentinels watching over other stars. This was from the belief that it ruled the affairs of the heavens; a belief current, till three centuries ago, from at least 3000 years before our era.



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 278 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
This is one of the four key stars in the heavens, also called archangel stars, assigning
Venant - Raphael The Healing Archangel (Regulus) Watcher of the North. At one time Regulas marked zero Cancer 2345 BC, one of the equinoxes while Formalhaut marked zero Capricorn, the other equinox point. Allen says “Early English astrologers made Regulus a portent of glory, riches, and power to all born under its influence. Proclus wrote: "The Lyon's heart is called of some men, the Royal Star, for they that are born under it, are thought to have a royal nativity." .Regulus enters the sign Virgo in 2012 AD. It entered the sign Leo in 156 BC.
Robson states: According to Ptolemy it is of the nature of Mars and Jupiter, but most later authors liken it to mars only, while Alvidas states that it is similar to the Sun in good aspect to Uranus. It gives violence, destructiveness, military honor of short duration, with ultimate failure, imprisonment, violent death, success, high and lofty ideals and strength, of spirit, and makes its natives magnanimous, grandly liberal, generous, ambitious, fond of power, desirous of command, high-spirited and independent.
Ebertin says : It may convey royal properties, noble mind, frankness, courage. The importance of this star is accentuated by its nearness to the ecliptic. Its effect is in the best sense that of Jupiter and Mars. On the Ascendant, it will give a courageous and frank character, especially if in conjunction with the Sun, Moon, Jupiter or Mercury.
Robson goes further and says that if Jupiter is on Regulas then the native gets fame, high preferment, especially of a military nature, success in the Church. Church can be substituted for a Temple (as both are momuments of worship). The Ascendant’s conjunction to Jupiter is further strengthened as there is aparallel of declination between Ascendant and Jupiter. According to interpreations, both from the East and West, the native will be preserved and protected from 1001 evils. In the present case, it should be noticed that Regulas is of the nature of Jupiter and Mars. Coincidentally, the native has both Jupiter and Mars on the ascendant and conjunct (though out of sign). Here Mars is the lord of the IXth and Mars is the significators of land and property (Bhoomiputra). Whereas Jupiter is the significator of the natural IXth, ie., religon, philosophy, etc. Pluto lord of IVth and Venus lord of Xth are semi sextile Mars, while Saturn from IXth is sextile Mars. Saturn in the XIth house, in the house of fulfillment and in the emotional and spiritual sign, fulfills the work he is destined for after a long period of waiting, a long period of trials and tribulations. I am given to understand that the temple structure was lying incomplete from 1982 for various reasons. Further during the period of Jupiter, from the age of 45 to 57 as per Saphariel’s “Planetary ages of men” (from the year 1989 to the year 2000 A.D.) he started the construction of the temple of Shri Sai Baba and got it was consecrated and opened for public rituals and worship from September 1991. From that period onwards he had a new beginning. His karmasthan is occupied by Uranus in the sign of Gemini. Uranus in the culmination, especially in Gemini writes life in chapters. One great chapter of trials, tribulation and dejection was over. Another chapter, the chapter of going into the avocation of elected bodies represented by Uranus started. He got popularity among the masses, the top politicians and the law enforcing authorities. Is man a glorious ape or a modified angel.

Jupiter transited Leo in 1991 and was also conjunct Regulas from 3rd Sept to 15th September 1991. Municipal elections, scheduled for March 1991 were postponed to 22nd Feb 1992. Shakespeare has said that we should set our boats to sail when the flood are high. The native was set on the path of success during the flood tides of victory. He won the elections hands down and the margin of victory was the highest – a record break that year. He has never looked back, winning election till date. His name is very popular and the image is that of a god, a guardian, a benefactor, a protector. A protector can also be called “The Mighty”.
c)Phecda (29^ E 39`) in the constellation of Gamma Ursa Major and is of the nature of Jupiter and Venus. Robson says that this constellation is said to give a quiet, prudent, suspicious, mistrustful, self-controlled, patient nature, but an uneasy spirit and great anger when roused.
Mars in the ascendant (in Virgo) falls on Thuban (6^ F 37`) in the constellation of Alpha Draco and is of the nature of Saturn and Mars. E W Bullinger in The Witness of the Stars tell us that Thuban, the subtle. Some 4,620 years ago it was the Polar Star. It is still a very important star in nautical reckonings, guiding the commerce of the seas, and thus 'the god of this world' is represented as winding in his contortions round the pole of the world, as if to indicate his subtle influence in all worldly affairs." Noonan says that when rising, Thuban indicates prospectors of gold and silver or those who are ministers of money (this might include accountants, clerical workers, cashiers etc. nowadays).
Neptune in the IInd house falls on Nodus I (2^ G 28`) in the constellation of Zeta Draco and of the nature of Saturn and Mercury. According to Ptolemy the bright stars are like Saturn and Mars. Draco gives an artistic and emotional but somber nature, a penetrating and analytical mind, much travel and many friends, but danger of robbery and accidental poisoning. It gives craft, ingenuity, and valor.
Uranus in the Xth house on Tabit (11^ C 02`) in the constellation of Pi 3 Orion and of the nature of Saturn and Mercury. It is said to give a strong and dignified nature, selfconfidence, inconstancy, arrogance, violence, impiety, and prosperity in trade and particularly in voyages or abroad, but danger of treachery and poison. It was thought by the Romans to be very harmful to cattle and productive of storms.
Saturn in the XIth house on Tejat Posterior (4^ D 40`) in the constellation of Mu Gemini and of the nature of Mercury and Venus. This star is listed under Dirah "Seed" or "Branch" in Robson's book. It entered Cancer in 1621 AD. Dr. Eric Morse in the Living Stars says that this was one of the dates significant in the rise of European thought and literature from the Renaissance onwards. According to Robson this star gives energy, force, power, protection.
Pluto in the XIIth house on Asselus Australis (7^ E 56`) in the constellation of Delta Cancer and of the nature of Mars and Sun. According to Ptolemy both the Aselli are of the nature of Mars and the Sun, but Alvidas states that the North Asellus (Asellus Borealis) is

like the Sun and Mars in sextile, and the South Asellus (Asellus Astralis) like the Sun and Mars in semisquare. Together they give care and responsibility, with a charitable and fostering nature, but danger of violent death, serious accidents and burns. Dr. Eric Morse says that a conjunction with the Moon, Mercury, Venus or Neptune, well aspected, will often reveal the poet, painter, musician unusually gifted, composer, psychic 'medium' or astrologer. In all cases too, there is a patience for which the donkey is respected, a quality necessary for all really reliable psychism. The effects of the fixed stars on Pluto have not been mentioned anywhere. If we have to conclude something, then we have to remember that Pluto signifies transformation. Pluto is in the sign of Leo and the lord of Leo is in XII th and almost conjunct Pluto, though out of sign. Uranus is sextile Pluto from Gemini and Neptune is semi-sextile Pluto from Libra. Further Mars is semi sextile Pluto from Virgo and at the same Saturn is semi sextile Pluto from Cancer. The native does not have a flair to poetry, painting or music. He surely deals with psychic realm and has great interest in astrology. With Pluto in the XIIth, the house dealing with occult , spiritualism and mysticism, there could be a slow transformation towards this end. Such a inner urge only could lead him on this path of temple building.(as Pluto is lord of VIth, concerning property and building and since it is Scorpio, it is secretive spiritual sign with intensity. If this argument is not valid then he could construct a for a luxurious lodge and board for royal treatment to unknown people (XIIth house).
Venus in the XIIth house on Praespae (6^ E 34`) in the constellation of Epsilon Cancer and of the nature of Moon and Mars. The unnamed stars; Eta, and Theta along with According to Robson Praesaepe was located in the Hindu 8th nakshatra Pushya "Flower", or Tishiya "Auspicious", with Brihaspati, the priest and teacher of the gods as presiding divinity Influences: favorable for sales, art, sculpture, learning, marital love, wearing of ointments, medicine and purchase of carriages when containing the moon)]. Allen says that it was sometimes figured as a Crescent, the head of an Arrow and also called Sidhaya "Prosperous". In Egyptian hieroglyphic language, the sign of the bee was a determinative in royal nomenclature, partly by analogy with the monarchic organization of these insects, but more especially because of the ideas of industry, creative activity and wealth which are associated with the production of honey. According to a Delphic tradition, the second of the temples built in Delphi had been erected by bees. In Orphic teaching, souls were symbolized by bees, not only because of the association with honey but also because they migrate from the hive in swarms, since it was held that souls 'swarm'.
Bees represent; an ordered community, obey their ruler, cooperation, industry, thrift, diligence, royalty, cleanliness, purity, chaste virgins, sweetness, honeyed words, 'the suave one" mellifluous: Flowing with sweetness or honey; sweet or rich in tone.
Allen says that astrologically Praesepe makes founders of large businesses ('business' from the 'buzzing', 'busy' bee). Robson says it causes disease, disgrace, adventure, insolence, wantonness, brutality, blindness, industry, order and fecundity; and makes its natives fortunate though liable to loss through others, and the founders of large businesses.
The native did invest even in contruction of buildings as Taurus occupies his cusp at the karmasthan also signifies such activities and promising him luck. Further he was involved with activities of construction of others and there were gains for him.

NO: 17 THE MASTER CUTTER
Born on 3rd Aug 1951 at 22.38 IST 73e52 18n34
The native lived with his parents, brother and 4 sisters, all under one roof. With Aries rising, and its lord Mars in the IVth house square Neptune in the VIIth and square Jupiter on the cusp of the ascendant (all 3 forming a T Square, his two marriages went to the rocks). However Neptune placed very close to the VIIth cusp( marriage) clearly denoted this tragic event. One of the strong features of this chart is Uranus degreecally on the 4th cusp. It has been observed from many charts that Uranus on the 4th cusp or in the 4th house creates problems with the mother or for evil domestic matters. Such a native can prosper and make a career of his own only when he separates. In the present case the configuration of Uranus square Jupiter and square Neptune is still worse. There was a vertical split in the family in year 2000 with the mother, brother and three sisters on one side and the native, his father and one sister living together. He has prospered having a big mansion and lot of earning through his tailoring business indicated by Venus and Saturn in Virgo. Over the years, couple of clients, who had Uranus on the fourth cusp were advised to live separately from their home (that too after convincing their parents). Good results were ensured and both the natives are happy and doing very well after taking such a bold step.
In the natal chart, the material trinity is formed by 2,6,10; ie, Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn. From the Sun and Moon (conjunct in Leo, the house of creativity, artistic skills, etc.) Taurus is the Xth house. According to Dr. WJ Simmonite, when Venus is in Virgo it denotes makers of sweets, cakes, delicious and artistic foods, art fabric makers, vendors of dress and food. Further Venus in VIth makes one fond of pretty adornments. He is a master cutter and caters to the top class of society in making suits and adornments. He often remarked: God created man but the tailor made him a gentlman. In the modern world one has to look trim and smart, with clothes enhancing one’s personality, which is one of the criteria for success, apart from speech.
So far as the VIIth house is concerned, with Neptune on the cusp of the VIIth (that too heavily afflicted, by a T square (with an opposition to Jupiter on the Ascendant cusp and square to Mars in the fourth and Uranus on the fourth cusp and in turn these two planets from the fourth form a square to Jupiter), gives undesirable marriage partner, creating fraud and deception with regard to marriage. Further, when Neptune is in Libra there is a tendency to clandestine, unconventional and illegitimate relationship, either concerning the native himself or even the marriage partner.
The beauty of the chart is the trine of Jupiter conjunct the ascendant cusp and the Sun and the Moon (also conjunct) in the fifth house (the house of creativity and personal enterprise. Jupiter the planet of benevolence and the uplifter with a good aspect to the luminaries gives him good vitality, health, abundance and happiness, despite all adverse results of other bad configurations in the chart. Such a trine saves him from innumerable evils and enables him to withstand all adversities.

The 10th house shows optimism and all the good qualities that any person should have.
Kamadhenu: Brihat Parashari Hora Shastra says that the sum of the longitudes of the Ascendant (Tanu, the body), the Sun (the soul) and the Moon (the Mind) is a very important sensitive point like to ascendant, karmasthan, fortuna, etc. Taking aclue from, I find that
the fixed star Wega falls on the Kamadhenu point (15^ J 12`). Ebertin says that Wega gives artistic talents.

Chinese equivalent Nan Ho, the Southern River, certain of the stars being called Shwuy Wei, a Place of Water
b)Muscida (22^ D 06`) falls on the constellation Omicron Ursa Major and of the nature of Mars.

VIIIth cusp falls on Zaurak (22^ B 56`) indicating fondness for travel and many travels, in the constellation of Gamma Eridanus. According to Ptolemy all the stars with the exception of Achernar are like Saturn. Eridanus gives a love of knowledge and science, much travel and many changes, a position of authority, but danger of accidents, especially at sea and of drowning. Ebertin says that Zaurak has a Saturnian character. Anyone who has this star connected with a planet in his chart should endeavor not to take life too seriously and put too much weight on everything people say. This person should struggle to overcome melancholy. Otherwise, this star could trigger off fear of death and suicidal tendencies.
IXth cusp falls on a)Ensis (22^ C 03`), voyages abroad, in the constellation of Orion and of the nature of Mars and Moon. It is said to give a strong and dignified nature, selfconfidence, inconstancy, arrogance, violence, impiety, and prosperity in trade and particularly in voyages or abroad, but danger of treachery and poison.

Noonan says that Alkes has always portended eminence to those born under its influence.

At a less intense level the native may become a landscape architect, a builder of canals, or in some other manner do business in merchandise connected with water.
The Luminaries On Fixed Stars:
The Sun conjunct Mercury falls on Asterion (16^ F 48`) in the constellation of Beta Canes Venatici and of the nature of Saturn and Venus. Robson says that this constellation gives a love of hunting and a penetrating mind, making those born under it faithful, keen, clever and fond of speculation.

Mars falls on a)Mimosa (10^ H 34`) in the constellation of Beta Crux and of the nature of Venus and Jupiter. Ebertin says that this stars gives an inventive mind, intuition, a grasp for the inner nature of one's fellow man. Deeply religious nature connected with mystical and theosophical interests. It is also the star of the astronomers. It is connected with medicine and health.
b) Acrux (10^ H 57`) Astrologers and occultists, in the constellation of Alpha crux and of the nature of Jupiter. It is also the star of the astronomers. There can be dormant skills or powers which in order to tap into them may require giving something up, or letting something go; as the Centaur (Centaurus) did in giving up his immortality to Prometheus, as Christ did on the cross when he said "into thy hands I commend my spirit" or forgiving as Christ forgave his persecutors while on the cross. It is also a star that deals with medicine and health.
c)Alphecca (11^ H 21`) indicating many travels by water in early life, in the constellation of Alpha Corona Borealis and of the nature of Mercury and Venus. According to Ptolemy it is of the nature of Venus and Mercury, but Alvidas considers it to be like Mars and Mercury. It gives honor, dignity and poetical and artistic ability. Alphecca is also the star that gifts oe with astrology.
Venus falls on Arcturus (23^ G 18`), prosperity by navigation and voyages, the perfectionist, in the constellation of Alpha Bootees and of the nature of Jupiter and Mars. In India it is the 15th nakshatra, Swati, "the Good Goer", or perhaps "Sword", but figured as a Coral Bead, Gem, or Pearl; and known there also as Nishtya, "Outcast", possibly from its remote northern situation far outside of the zodiac, whence, from its brilliancy, it was taken to complete the series of Hindu asterisms. Robson says that It gives riches, honors, high renown, self-determination and prosperity by navigation and voyages.
Saturn falls on Menkant (11^ H 33`) in the constellation of Theta Centaurus and of the nature of Venus and Mercury. Robson says that it gives love of arms, strong passion, and an energetic nature.

b)Alrisha (27^ A 17`) in the constellation Alpha Pisces and of the nature of Mars and Mercury. This star that binds the Fishes together has a unifying influence.
Neptune falls on Alsuhail (10^ F 17`) indicating prosperity in voyages, in the constellation of Lambda Vela and of the nature of Saturn and Jupiter. Robson says that it gives prosperity in trade and voyages. Strength of mind and spirit. Connected to death by drowning.

Pluto, conjunct the culmination and also parallel by declination, falls on Procyon(24^ D
24`) indicating a restless and passionate person with many travels in different places, in the constellation of Alpha Canis Minor and of the nature of Mercury and Mars. It makes the native dig into the secrets of the mind. Procyon is a very fortunate star; known to the Mesopotamians as 'The Star of the Crossing of the Water - Dog', as it lies near their River of Heaven, the Milky Way. Procyon foretold wealth and renown, and in all astrology has been much regarded, giving 'Everlasting of the Right, and Good Effect'. It also confers willpower and ability to put thoughts and plans into action. According to Ebertin, Procyon gives drive and a good sharp mind. Linked with positive stellar bodies, success is made greater, but the native, in order to avoid a fiasco, has always to take care not to be imprudent. Especially dangerous is Procyon configured with Mars and Pluto.
With the Moon (from the VIIIth) making a trine to Saturn in the IVth and to Jupiter ( in the XIIth), mental disciplie with intellectual and spiritual vibrations are channelised through this grand trine, thereby enabling him to utilize the the gifts overflowing from the rich harvest of Spica for the benefit of society with an altruistic approach of sharig knowledge so that there is sweetness and light for everyone that comes to gaze at the vault of the heavens that is infinite in knowledge and wonder. Prof. Vaidya has travelled miles and miles over the oceans of the earth, yet he goes on endlessly into the unfathomable ocean of the cosmos with the stars Acrux, Mimosa and Alphecca as his searchlights of the heavens and the power of healing men with his hands vibrating the healing touch. Lead, kindly light ! heal the body with your hands and illuminate our minds with your knowledge.

THE CHARTS WITH STARS PROMISING KNOWLEDGE IN SCIENCE & LITERATURE
“ ...........................beware of man, For knowledge must to thee Like the great floods to Egypt ever be.”
While going through the Acharaya Shridhar Govind Joshi’s “Meditation Upon Certain Principles from Brihat Parashari”, under the sub-title “Operating through Navamsa – a divine plan”, I came across two brilliant cases. The Acharya uses the Sayana System for interpretation of the charts. The aspects used by the Acharya are sign-wise.
Being very curious to see how the fixed stars affect their lives and activities, after scrutinizing, I found the following :

THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 295 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
NO.19 DR. JAYANTRAO NARLIKAR
Born on 19th July 1938 at 3.16 IST, Nasik.
After finding the Trigarah Yoga (the sum total of three planet in conjunction in a sign and its subsequent placement in the chart that give favourable results) his statement about the native is as follows:
“Because of this conjunction this brilliant native solved the puzzle about the creation of the universe, which was lying unanswered so far, and thus increasing the status of India in the view of the whole world. This is the only person so far to be honoured by the significant award of Padma Bushan, at such a young age”. From this statement, we gather that he is a scientist and it would be worthwhile to see how the fixed stars have influenced him in his successful career as a scientist, that too at an early period of his life.
The Cusps:
His ascendant (16^ C 17`) falls on the star Rigel (15^ C 57`). Rigel gives learning in science and helps in inventions and discoverises. Rigel also give a rise in early life. It gives preferment, favours from others and also success.
IInd cusp (11^ D 16`) falls on Sirus (12^ D 11`), the star of a successful scientist, which gives good organising capabilities and prominence in Uranian matters.
IIIrd cusp (6^ E 18`) falls on a) Praesape (6^ E 28`) giving him the gift of oratory and
b)Asellus Borealis (6^ E 40) making him energetic with the drive for reforms.
IV the cusp is 4^ F 28`
Vth cusp is 7^ G 17`
VIth cusp 12^ H 41`
VIIth cusp is 16^ I 17` influenced by the rays of Rigel from opposition/
VIIIth cusp is 11^ J 16` influenced
IXth cusp is 6^ K 16`
Xth cusp (4^ L 28`) fall on a) Deneb Adige which is favourable for scientific pursuits.
b) Formalhaut (3^ L 58`) that gives him success as a scientist and a writer.
XIth cusp (7^ A 17`) falls on Algenib (7^ A 16`) giving him oratory skills The Moon is conjunct his eeleventh cusp.
XIIth cusp (12^ B 41`) falls on Almach (12^ B 19`) and Menkar (12 ^ B 24`) giving him the liking for science and organising ability.



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 296 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
The Planetary Position Are As Follows:
a. The Sun (25^ C 35`) falls on Procyon (23^ D 56`) giving him the skills and ability to put thoughts and actions into plans.
b. The Moon (6^ A 12`) conjunct the XIth cusp bring success through speech and dynamic thought.
c. Mercury (19^ E 26`) is on Algenubi(18^ E 42`)
d. Venus (5^ F 23`) falls on Alula Boreali (4^ F 45)
e. Mars (27^ D 24`) falls on Aludra (27^ D 41`)
f. Jupiter (1Pis54`R) conjuct the Xth cusp, his karmasthan, falls on Ancha
(1^ L 50`) b) Sadalmelek((1^ L 50`) giving him fame in science
through inventions and discoveries. c) Formalhaut (2^ L 58`) giving him success as a scientist and writer.
g) Saturn -17Ari21`) i) Uranus (17 ^ B 17`)
j) Neptune (18Vir59`) k) Pluto (29 ^ D 33`)
l) Rahu (24^ H 45`).
The acharya has analysed that through the Trigarha yoga, the sum of the longitudes fall on
22^ L 31` and according to him this spot happens to lie in conjunction aspect with the natal Jupiter in the Xth house itself. Through the above analysis, the position of the fixed stars and planets with their characteristics and interpretation clearly tell us about his success in the field of science full of inventions and discoveries, that too at a very young age (Rigel on the Ascendant) and giving him one of the highest title of honour of our country, the Padma Bushan as Jupiter is conjuct the Culmination and on the stars of Sadalmelek and Formalhaut, giving him great success and honour.

FIXED STARS

THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 298 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
Ms. SUNITA JOSHI
Born on 12th April 1942 at 00.32 a.m., Nasik.
The acharya says that “the native succeeded tremendously well in educational field. First class first throughout from Standard 1 to M.A. Innumerable awards during the life so far, in the field of education. The native’s name is Miss. Sunita Joshi”.
He calculated the sum total of the planets falling in conjunction in Gemini(VIth house) of
Jupiter in 17^ C` 41` and Mars 21^ C 13` and he got the point at 8^ F 54` in the IX house. Hence the native succeeded well in the educational field.
Now, by finding the cusps and planets of her chart, let us see if the fixed stars play any important role in her success in the field of education.
The Cusps
1. (Ascendant) 8^ J 54` falls near Facies. Dr. Eric Morse says that on the more philosophical side it will mark those who must see their outlook and beliefs carried into practical effect somewhere. It gives that aggressive feeling of taking every challenge on war footing. The Ascendant Lord, Saturn is conjunct Uranus (Uranus is on Keid in the constellation of Eridanus. According to Ptolemy Eridanus gives a love of knowledge and science, much travel and many changes, a position of authority) in the sign of determination and down to earth practicality and are trine to Neptune in the ninth house in a sign of meticulous craftsmanship and practicality.
2. (11^ K 45`) on Armus is in the constellation of Capricornus. A Capricornian nature bears the marks of this cold, silent and still universe. It is built upon an original movement of self-withdrawal and concentration. Externally this character appears lifeless and often dulled to gray sobriety and self-effacement. However, life retreats to the depths of being and it is the slow upsurge of these deep forces, often long ignored by the person him- or herself, which permits the affirmation of personal qualities by the full exercise of self- control. This self-command is the fruit of long training of the will, exercised to demonstrate mastery of instinct and feeling. The symbol of the goat climbing a rocky eminence, is very appropriate to well-developed subjects born under the influence of Capricorn who seem for ever persistently and patiently climbing upwards, and who are capable of great resistance in overcoming obstacles in the way, their dauntless energy and courage in facing difficulties.
3. (17^ L 00`)
4. (20^ A 12`) falls on Baten Kaitos of the nature of Saturn. The Saturnine properties, such as inhibition, reserve, caution, solitude and simplicity are often forced on to such people, either by a mundane power or a higher power.

5. (18^ B 56`) on Rana in the constellation of Eridanus and of the nature of Saturn. According to Ptolemy all the stars with the exception of Achernar are like Saturn. Eridanus gives a love of knowledge and science, much travel and many changes, a position of authority.
6. 14^ C 11` falls on Cursa falling in the constellation of Eridanus gives a love of knowledge and science, much travel and many changes.
7. 8^ D 54` on Alhena in the constellation of Gemini and of the Mercury and Venus. a star giving eminence and hoinour through art. Robson says that it bestows imminence in art
8. 11^ E 56`
9. 17^ F 00` on Asterion in the constellation of Canes Venatici and of the nature of Saturn and Venus. Robson says that this star gives a penetrating mind, making those born under it faithful, keen, clever and fond of speculation.
10. 20^ G 12` falls in the constellation of Eta Cairns and gives strength of mind and spirit. Prosperity in trade and voyages . The star gives dignity, piety, usefulness and acquisitiveness, and gives danger to the eyes, according to Robson.
11. 18^ H 56` falls on North Scale which gives good fortune, ability to speak and write, analytical mind and honour.
12. 14^ I 11` on Ras Algethi in the constellation of Hercules and of the nature of Saturn. Ebertin says that it gives boldness and a drive to gain power.
The Planets And The Fixed Stars
The Sun (21^ A 15`) falls on Acamar, giving a love for art and science and acquisition of public position.
The Moon (6^ L 26`) falls on Sadalachabia, giving preferment and favours.The Moon also falls on Skat, givng the knowledge on the theories of life.
Mercury (12^ A 6`) falls on Alpheratz – a pioneer and interested in the study of human nature. Alphertz also gives the skills to write on science, religion, philosophy and makes one a good speaker and writer.and also the skills for the upbringing the youth.
Venus (4^ L 57`) falls on Denib Adige giving interest in the study of arts. Venus is the lord of 5th (knowledge, education and creativity and also the lord of the karmasthan.

Mars (21^ C 12`) falls on Capella which gives interest in politics, literary and poetical ability. Capella gives interest in social and educational problems, teaching and much ambition. B) Mars also falls on Bellatrix giving much activity, advancement and success.
Jupiter (17^ C 41`) on Hoedus I giving skills to write on science, religion, philosophy and makes one a good speaker and writer and also the skills for the upbringing the youth.
Saturn (26^ B 00`) on Misam denoting an adventurous individual.
Uranus (28^ B 12`) on Electra giving much ambition.
Neptune (27^ F 53`) on Markeb in the constellation of Argo Navis and of the nature of Saturn and Jupiter. Robson says that this star gives piety, a wide knowledge, educational work and voyages.
Pluto (3^ E 28`)
Rahu (12^ F 59`) on Coxa a star indicating love of arts.
Part of Fortune (12^ F 59`) on Coxa –a star indicating love of arts.
In the above case most of the cusps and planets fall on fixed stars that give education and knowledge and advancement in life, especially in the field of arts. Small wonder that she has won many awards in life as stated by the Acharya.

SPICA, THE LUCKY GIRL
Like the acharya, I too am luck to come across two very brilliant students
(chart no. 9 and 10)
Born oN 20TH October 1982 at 6.21 IST, Mumbai.
This young girl, has been getting distinction all throught and standing first in the class. Aparat from this, she is blessed with parents highly placed and nothing to want for or struggle. Before even passing her twelfth standard, she was brimming with confidence and saying with great determination that she will go to the best engineering college in the country, to which her parents (who came along with her) nodded in the affirmative that she will succeed. I was given the good news that she passed her examination with flying colours and got the admission easily.
The Effects Of The Fixed Stars In The Native’s Chart:
This is a peculiar and outstanding chart with first cusp (22^ g 24`) conjunct Venus, lord of
ascendant and eight (22^ g 27`) on Spica, the inventor, the scientist, the sculptor, the lover of arts and science, the gift to humanity; conjunct Saturn, lord of VIth on Arcturus on Alpha Bootes and according to Robson it gives riches, honors, high renown, self-determination and prosperity by navigation and voyages; conjunct the Sun, the lord of XIth on Nekkar on Beta Bootes giving prosperity from work, strong desires, a tendency to excess, a fondness for rural pursuits, together with some liking for occultism; conjunct Pluto, lord of second on Izar in the constellation of Epsilon Bootes also giving prosperity from work, strong desires, a tendency to excess, a fondness for rural pursuits, together with some liking for occultism. The Ascendant is very powerful with all the lucky fixed stars there to give this young girl everything in life and the greatest imperishable gift, knowledge.
The fourth cusp (21^ j 58`) falls on Sulapath in the constellation of Gamma Lyre and according to Ptolemy it is like Venus and Mercury. It is said to give an harmonious, poetical and developed nature, fond of music and apt in science and art. It is also on Deneb Okab in the constellation of Delta Aquila. It is said to give great imagination, strong passions, indomitable will, a dominating character, and influence over others, clairvoyance, a keen penetrating mind and ability for chemical research.
The Seventh cusp (22^ A 24`) falls on Baiten Kaitos with the gift of mechanical ability and
Acamar (23^ A 00`) the star with scientific acumen.
The tenth cusp (21^ D 58`) falls on Gomeisa in the constellation of Beta Canis Minor and Pollux. Pollux has a strong Martian nature and has the name 'the wicked boy' of the of the sibling Twins. According to its nature, this star is brutal and tyrannical, violent and cruel if in conjunction with the Sun, Moon, Ascendant, MC or with malefics. Just as Mars has its good sides if the energy it creates is channeled constructively, so Pollux should not always be considered as unhelpful.

All the angles are on cardinal signs and due to the effects of the fixed stars she has hitched her wagon to these rising stars of the angle promising science, art, mechanical ability, invention and the courage and strength to face the world when challenged with the other side of callousness.
The fifth cusp falls on Denib Algedi (23 K33) which makes her a student of science. Besides this it is also on Sador which is in the constellation of Cygnus giving a contemplative, dreamy, cultured and adaptable nature .
The VIth cusp falls on Matar (25 L 43), giving the gift of writing,
The ninth cusp (21^ C 11`) falls on Phact, Elnath ad Capella, all of them giving the liking for science and technology. This cusp is in trine with the ascendant and and Venus, Saturn, the Sun and Pluto.
The Moon conjunct Uranus (the planet owning the scientific sign of altruism) is on Acrab (15J45)also giving the mind the abilities of scientific studies
Mercury is on Diadem (8 G05) and Vindemiatrix (9 G56), giving the abilities of scientific and mechanical discoveries.
Mars is on Atria (19I30) in the constellation of tringulum Australis, and of the planetary nature of Mercury, a planet that again gives scientific and mechanical abilities.
Neptune, the lord of the sixth is on Aculeus (24^I05`). Dr. Eric Morse says that this star along with Acumen has a notorious reputation in astrology as 'blind stars' or stars associated with eyesight problems. These stars shows up a negative Mars-Moon quality in people who have them poorly aspected, with a tendency towards a morbid outlook, seeing the worst rather than the best in everything. If their religious views are affected, as so often with anything in Sagittarius, there is a tendency to be either the 'hellfire and damnation brigade' or to take up a fierce anti-religious and even anti-God stance. But at their best, well aspected, they can have very sharp minds and a perception well above average as though, perhaps 'blind' to what we see and take for granted, they see what we do not, at levels where eyesight does not reach. Not for nothing has the word Acumen come down to us as a term for a sharp mind.
A thing of beauty is joy forever. Birth charts that walk with the rhythm of the planets on the path of hard work, with optimism, ambition, dedication and with a vision of hope for accomplishing one’s life mission with a message from the stars promising success is the greatest happiness to men and women dedicated to this divine science.
I pray that we have many more young men and women with such lucky charts and may humanity see such souls with the promise of progess and betterment for the race, so that every fleeting moment that slips by the hour glass is converted into vibrations full of knowledge and practical applications. For the Lord has said : Come, I refresh all that labour. One lamp lighting another lamp to dispel darkness. You are the light of world. Apart from that you are also the salt of the earth, to preserve and flavour.

NO: 22
A COMPUTER SCIENTIST IN LOVE WITH ASTROLOGY AND ASTRONOMY.
4th March 1981 at 12.15 p.m. , Mumbai
William Shakespeare was absolutely correct when he makes one of his characters say“There is a tide in the affairs of men which, taken at its flood, leads on to fortune”.
We are really “Stuffs that dreams are made of”.
This is a case study of a commerce gradauate, who until 2001 would not have dreamt of entering the field of computer science and becoming a systems analyst, engineer and scientist. There has been a total transformation during the last three years. In 2002 he studied networking and on 12th August 2003 a reputed multi national company recruited him as as a systems engineer. It is an early rise in life given by Rigel on the Ascendant. Blessed with a sharp and intuitive mind, he does much research and development that could make others to stare at him and wonder how.
A Few Significators:
Computer programmers and operators: Mercury, Gemini, Scorpio.
Electronics: Urnaus, Mars, Aquarius
Electronic sheets: Mercury and Aquarius
Inspiration: 9th house, Saggitarus and Neptune
Innovation: Neptune and Uranus
Intensity: Mars, Uranus, Pluto and Scorpio
Analysis: Gemini, Mercury; Accuracy:Mercury
Systems: Jupiter and Saturn
The effects of the fixed stars in his chart:
Fixed Stars on Angles:
1. There are three stars on his Ascendant:
a) Cursa (14 ^ C 58`) in the constellation of Eridanus and of the nature of Saturn. Ptolemy says that Eridanus gives a love of knowledge and science, much travel and many changes.
b) Hasselah (16^ C 10`) in the constellation of Auriga and of the nature of Mars and Mercury. Robson says that the constellation is said to give self-confidence, interest in social and educational problems.
c) Rigel (16^ C 30`) in the constellation of Orion and of the nature of Jupiter and Saturn.



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 306 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
According to Ptolemy and Lilly it is of the nature of Jupiter and Saturn, but later authors consider it favorable and similar to Jupiter and Mars. Alvidas likens it to Mercury Mars and Jupiter. Robson says that it gives benevolence, honor, riches, happiness, glory, renown and inventive or mechanical ability. Rigel is the star that gives an early start.
2. The Nadir falls on El. Kophrah (3^ F 21`) in the constellation of Ursa Major and of the quality of Mars. According to Ptolemy it is said to give a quiet, prudent, suspicious, mistrustful, self-controlled, patient nature, but an uneasy spirit and great anger when roused.
3. The descendant falls on Rasalgethi (15^ I 19`) in the constellation of Saturn. According to Ptolemy this constellation is of the nature of Mercury and is said to give strength of character, tenacity and fixity of purpose, an ardent nature. Ebertin says that it gives boldness and a drive to gain power. If well aspected it is said to give enjoyment and favors from women.
The Culmination: William Shakespeare in “TheTempest” says : “I find my Zenith doth depend upon A most auspicious star: whose influence, If now I court not, but omit, my fortunes Will ever after droop.”
Young man, hold fast and sieze the fleeting opportunity of Fate and pave a career promising progress, development and success. It is the most opportune moment to double click your way to a very promising career of the new millennium. “There is a tide in the affairs of men Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune...”
The Culmination falls on :
a) Sadalmelek ((3^ L 37`) the star of inventions, discoveries and scientific pursuits.It falls in the constellation Alpha Aquarius and has the nature of Jupiter and Saturn.
b) Formalhaut(3^ L 34`) in the constellation of Piscis Austrinis and of the nature of Venus and Mercury, a star that gives success as a scientist. According to Ptolemy, it is of the nature of Venus and Mercury; and, to Alvidas, of Jupiter in square to Saturn from Pisces and Sagittarius. It is said to be very fortunate and powerful. It is assumed, however, that the helpful influence is the greater one and if in conjunction with Mercury, it is said to stimulate mental capabilities and promise success as a writer or scientist. A conjunction with Jupiter or on the MC will bring favor from dignitaries of the church. According to Robson, if culminating, it gives great and lasting honors.
c) Denib Adige (5^ L 00`) in the constellation of Cygnus and of the nature of Venus and Mercury. It is a star of artistic and scientific pursuits. Robson



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY

says that it is of the nature of Venus and Mercury, and gives an ingenious nature and a clever intellect that is quick at learning. Ebertin says that the star corresponds to a combination of Mercury and Venus influence and is therefore favorable for artistic and scientific pursuits, which are carried out with the aim of gain.
In 2001, the native became a Commerce Graduate. From then onwards, till August 2003, he was studying networking, almost from dawn to dusk, with such an intensity that he learnt what people normally take 3 years. On 12th August 2003, he was offered a job of a Systems Engineer. At the same time he completed his two-year course in Astrology. Rigel gave him the early rise. Uranus, the planet signifying electronics was moving towards the natal meridaian cusp and nearing the stars of scientific pursuits. At that particular moment Jupiter did not make a degreecal oppoision to Uranus (moving direct and retrograde) This coinfiguration becomes important because Jupiter is the co-lord of the Xth and lord of VIIth (assignments through contracts). Further, there was a mutual reception between the planets of innovation, ie., Uranus and Neptune, and this configuration will remain for a long time to come. From Jan to March 2003, there was a conjunction of his progressed moon with transit Pluto near the seventh cusp. His contract with the multinational company brought in a transformation, a transformation on the material plane (as it is the 1st cycle of the progressed moon).
The transits on 12th June 2003 at 5.30 a.m.:
The Sun 18 Leo 54`; the Moon 16K54`, to be approaching a conjunction with his progressed Venus (in the sign of Aquarius and 8th house – the house of deeds and documents of contracts) at the time of signing his contract. Venus is also the lord of his 11th progressed cusp and according to Saphariel’s planetary age of man, it occurred in the period of Venus.
Mercury 16C07, trine natal Mercury; Venus 17E02`; Mars 8 L56` (lord of natal 11th conjunct
lord of progressed 11th); Jupiter 26 E 38`); Saturn 3 D36`; Uranus 1 L 22` ® trine natal
Venus; Neptune 11K 36` (Lord of natal 11th) trine radical Moon and Mercury (the combination of Venus, Mercury, Moon, Uranus and Neptune (Uranus and Neptune having mutual reception) spurs up the power on intuition and new knowledge through great
inspiration; Pluto 17I15` conjunct descendant trine transit Sun (lord of natal descendant);
Rahu 25B41`.
The Transit Of Uranus Over The Years In Pisces, The Karmasthan:
Uranus beomes retrograde at 2Pis 19` on 8 June 2004, becomes direct at 29Aqu59`.
a) On 1 Dec 2004 and again becomes conjunct the natal 10th cusp on the stars of science, innovation, technology (by January 2005).
b) Uranus (the lord of natal 9th) will be conjunct natal Venus on 25th Jan 2005 (the lord of natal 5th and 12th).



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 308 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
c) On 5th May 2006 transit Uranus will be conjunct his natal Sun (the signifactor of achievement) in the radical 10th house.
d) On 1st April 2008 transit Uranus will be conjunct his radical Mars (lord of the 11th). At that time, transit Mars will make a trine to transit Mars will make a trine of transit Uranus, radical Venus, radical Sun and radical Mars and the 6th cusp from the 2nd house (Cancer).
The houses 2, 6 and 10 form the material trinity. Apart from material benefits, from all the discussions I had with the native, he is firm in attaining spiritual development. Progressed Moon will be moving to his 8th cusp, making a trine with the 12th and the 4th . the cusps 4, 8 and 12 form the spiritual trine and progressed Moon is at the end of its 1st cycle and in a couple of years will begins its second cycle – the dawn of psychic awakening.
Character is destiny. During the period of Venus (from 15 to 24) the native was under the guidance of his parents and spiritual development became a way of life. Neptune, the planet of Divinity and his karmasthan is in Sagittarius along with Uranus (in the sign of religion and high consciousness. Neptune is sextile Pluto on Spica and in the sign of balance and justice. The Moon conjunct Mercury (lord of ascendant) are sextile Neptune. Such fortunate aspects do transform the mind leading to spiritual and intellectual development. Besides this, the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn and their good aspects with the Moon and Mercury (through translation of light) gives further spiritual and intellectual depth, with the subconscious awakened to a warning: what does it profit a man to gain the whole world but to suffer the loss of his soul. Mercury, the messenger of the gods, Buddha, in the sign of intelligence and enlightenment, with a trine aspect to Pluto in Libra, has strengthened his mind (Moon conjunct Mercury) to pursue the mid-path in his cosmic journey with the blessings of many men of knowledge in the spiritual world.
Other Cusps On The Fixed Stars:
The second cusp on Alzir (10^ D 54`) in the constellation of Gemini and of the nature of Mercury and Venus. The native should take care of his health by having nutritious food and medical care.
The third cusp is on Azmidiske (5 ^ E 43`) on the constellation of Puppis and of the nature of Jupiter and Saturn. Gives strength of mind and prosperity in trde and voyages.
The sixth cusp is on
a)Mimosa (11^ h 10`) in the constellation of Crux and of the nature of Venus and Jupiter. Crux denotes a strong spiritual influence. It indicates willingness to accept sacrifice and gives fortitude in sorrow. The Cross gives choices that bring hopes and fears; making decisions about which road to take in life, learning to discriminate. There is often a lasting emotional or psychological wound, or wounds from accidents etc. There can be dormant skills or powers which in order to tap into them may require giving something up, or letting something go; as the Centaur (Centaurus) did in giving up his immortality to Prometheus, or forgiving as Christ did on the cross.



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 309 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
According to Ebertin it gives an inventive mind, intuition, a grasp for the inner nature of one's fellow man. Deeply religious nature connected with mystical and theosophical interests. It is a star that gives love for astrology and the occult.
b) Acrux (11^ h 34`), again a star with the gift of astrology, astronomy and the occult, in the constellation of Alpha Crux and of the nature of Jupiter. Crux denotes a strong spiritual influence. It indicates willingness to accept sacrifice and gives fortitude in sorrow. The Cross gives choices that bring hopes and fears; making decisions about which road to take in life, learning to discriminate. Robson says that this star which gives religions beneficence, ceremonial, justice, magic and mystery, and is frequently prominent in the horoscopes of astrologers and occultists. According to Ebertin it gives inventive mind, intuition and wisdom, a grasp for the inner nature of one's fellow man. The gift of successful investigation of the hidden side of things. A deeply religious nature connected with mystical and theosophical interests.
c)Alphecca (once again with a gift in astrology and position of command) (11^ h 59`) in the constellation of Corona Borealis and of the nature of Venus and Mercury. According to Robson and Ptolemy it is of the nature of Venus and Mercury, but Alvidas considers it to be like Mars and Mercury. It gives honor, dignity and poetical and artistic ability.
d)Menkent (11^ h 59`) in the constellation of Centaurus and of the nature of Mercury and Venus. It makes us energetic and a liking for astronomy.
The ninth cusp falls on Bos (4^ k 51`) in the constellation of Capricornus and of the nature of Saturn and Venus giving a sharp and piercing intellect.
The Luminaries On Fixed Stars:
The Sun is on Achener (15^ l 00`) ( on the star of science and knowledge) in the constellation of Eridanus and of the nature of Jupiter. Robson says that Eridanus gives a love of knowledge and science, much travel and many changes, a position of authority.
The Moon is on Alnair (15^ k 35`) in the constellation of Alpha Grus, the Crane. The crane was used as a symbol of astronomers by the Ancient Egyptians.
Other Planets On Fixed Stars:
Mercury is on Castra (19^ k 35`) in the constellation of Capricornus and of the nature of Saturn and Jupiter indicting uncontrollable temper.
Venus is on Denib Adige (5^ l 00`) in the constellation of Cygnus and of the nature of Venus and Mercury. It is a star of artistic and scientific pursuits. Robson says that it is of the nature of Venus and Mercury, and gives an ingenious nature and a clever intellect that is quick at learning. Ebertin says that the star corresponds to a combination of Mercury and Venus influence and is therefore favorable for artistic and scientific pursuits, which are carried out with the aim of gain.

Jupiter and Saturn are on Diadem (8^ G 38`) in Coma Berenices and of the nature of Saturn and Mercury. Robson says that it gives a sauve and well-bred manners and there is some love of, or, ability for the stage.
Uranus is on Kornephoros (00^ i 46`) in the constellation of Hercules and of the nature of Mercury. According to Ptolemy it is like Mercury. It is said to give strength of character, tenacity and fixity of purpose, an ardent nature and dangerous passions.
Neptune is on:
a) Lesath (23^ i 42`) in the constellation of Scorpius and of the nature of Mercury and Mars. Ebertin says that if associated with a benefic stellar body and if channeled in the right direction, there is the possibility that the energy associated with the Mars nature can make for marked achievements. Its qualities in the horoscope are very much those of a probing, sharp intellect and incisive wit, every bit as damaging as a knife to its opponent. It is one of the three Scorpio stars in Sagittarius which can be held to account for the often surprising bite in the otherwise genial, jovial Sagittarian. Dr. Eric Morse says that; it does show them to have an enterprising spirit of keenness of insight, not always thought of in connection with that religio-philosophical ninth sign of the zodiac. People with star strong in their charts are noted for doing well in debate, business, sport, and high office in general.
b)Grimium (24^ i 16`) in the constellation of Draco and of the nature of Saturn and Mercury. According to Ptolemy the bright stars are like Saturn and Mars. Draco gives an artistic and emotional but somber nature, a penetrating and analytical mind, much travel and many friends, but danger of robbery and accidental poisoning. It gives craft, ingenuity, and valor.
Pluto is on : a) Spica (23^ G 21`) in the constellation of Alpha Virgo and of the nature of Venus and Mercury. According to Ptolemy it is of the nature of Venus and Mars; and, to Alvidas, of Venus, Jupiter and Mercury. It gives success, renown, riches, a sweet disposition, love of art and science. Spica is a gift to humanity. With Pluto on this star and in the fifth house, there could be a transformation in the use of knowledge, creativity and learning in general.
b) Pluto on Arcturus (23^ G 55`) in the constellation of Alpha Bootes and of the nature of Mars and Jupiter. The general influence of this star in the words of Robson is that it gives riches, honors, high renown, self-determination and prosperity by navigation and voyages. It is the star of technical perfection.
The chart of this native holds a promise of rise in life in the field of art, science, technology, astrology, astronomy, occult sciences and spiritualism. He could be a walking encyclopaedia of systematic knowledge. He will also be provided wealth, riches, honour and name. I pray that he gets his desires fulfilled to his heart’s content and may his tribe increase and multiply so that society would become a better place to live.

Stark reality with no final conclusion
With the amalgamation and fusion of knowledge from astronomy with the research on the governance of the of human and sub lunar affairs by astrologers against the vast backdrop of this ever expanding universe it is rather difficult to come up with any conclusion on the subject of the fixed stars. The Milky Way contains our solar system, of which the earth is a tiny speck. The massive ensemble of stars visible to our eyes at night are all part of this great galaxy. Astronomers state that the largest telescope can view millions of galaxies and each galaxy could contain over 200 billion stars. Modern day astronomers believe that there are 1000000000000000000000 (1 followed by 22 zeros) stars in the universe. Sirius is 40 times bigger than our Sun. Capella’s diameter is 16 times larger than the Sun’s diameter. The largest stars, if placed at the Sun's position, would easily engulf Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. The smallest white dwarf stars are as big as the earth while the neutron stars are as small 20 km in diameter. In the 1990s astronomers discovered planets orbiting stars outside our solar system. Scientist are of the opinion that many stars have planetary systems.
Apart from the unending astronomical discoveries increasing at a stupendous pace, the lack of transparency of information and the very limited use of the fixed stars by astrologers in interpreting and delineating the birth charts, it would be rather preposterous to arrive at final conclusions about the use of fixed stars in astrology. Instead of arriving at any conclusion, I fervently appeal to all astrologers to make attempts to do further study and research on this topic. The astrologer’s laboratory is wide open universe including topics such as mundane astrology, natal astrology, medical astrology, etc. The sky, the first picture book of man, consisting of various beams and vibrations of different magnitude, the very source of all energy govern the affairs of all matter in various forms. The study of astrology, and moreover the complex study of the fixed stars, needs continuous and concentrated study with inputs of untiring and unceasing efforts. From my experience, it is only after monitoring the events in the lives of persons it is possible to note the cause and effects of the planets and stars on human affairs. Very few mortals are blessed with great power of intuition. Further, if intuition is misused or not nurtured, it either fails to enlighten or enhances self undoing. This gift is like the holy basil that is to kept away from dirt and unclean environment. The learned astrologer (Sayanacharya) Shri Shantaram Pandurang Kini told one of his successful students, a legal luminary then, that the study of astrology requires a solid 16 hours of study daily. Shri Kini taught him for 8 hours daily and told him to find another 8 hours daily to study at home. As the student’s aim to master astrology, he accepted the proposal and took up the study as a challenge. Today this student is a very successful consultant in the USA. After a lot of interaction with many of Shri Kini’s student, I am given to understand that they too were burning their midnight oil to gain proficiency in astrology, which included the study of fixed stars. I was also told by these students that Shri Kini was immersed in the study of astrology day and night, in the conscious and subconscious. With his efforts in his conscious and subconscious state over the year, his yearning for knowledge of firmaments became a prayer that vibrated through the kundalini and his crown plex or chakra linking him to the secrets of the vaults and temples of the heavens. I can only end the the present study with a prayer to one and all that continuous and scientific research should be carried out for further enlightenment in this Divine Science.

FIXED STARS : A COMMENCEMENT



THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 313 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
Alongside the above illustration captioned “Outcast star escapes Milky Way”, Deborah Zabarenko from Washington writes the following:
“An outcst star is zooming out of the Milky Way, the first every seen escaping the galaxy, astronomers reported on Tuesday.
The star is heading for the emptiness of intergalactic space after being ejected from the heart of the Milk Way following a close encounter with a black hole, said Warren Brown, an astronomer at the Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. The outcast is going so fast – over 1.5 million mph – that astronomers believe it was lobbed out of the galaxy by tremendous force of a black hole thought to sit at the Milky Way’s centre. That speed is about twice the velocity needed to escape the galaxy’s grip, Brown said by telephone.
“We have never before seen a star moving fast enough to completely escape the confines of our galaxy,” he said. “We’re tempte to call it the outcast star because it was forcefully tossed from its home.”
The star used to be part of a binary pair, waltzing with its companion star close to the rime of the black hole. In this case, “close” is a relative term’ the actual distance was probably about 50 times the 93 million-mile distancedistance between Earth and the Sun. As the two stars twirled around each other; they were pulledfaster and faster toward the edge of the black hole, one of those moster drains in space whose gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape once it is consumed.
While the companion star was captured by the black hole, the outcast continued on its whirling path around its edge.
Objects go faster the closer they get to black holes and this star was probably moving at an extraordinary speed, perhaps as high as 20 million mph. That very speed, coupled with the speed of its twirling, sent the outcast zooming toward the edge of the Milky Way and beyond. At this point, the outcast is about 180,000 light years from Earth, in an outer region of the galaxy known as the halo. A light year is about 6 trillion mile, the distance light travels in a year.”
In the first quarter of the twentieth century, man landing on the moon was still a fantasy but as the years rolled on by decades, the frontiers of space exploration opened up. During the third millennium, though at it’s still in its infancy, we will be heading for the Aquarian Age midway. By the inexorable pace at which science and technology is progressing, more light will be thrown on our galaxy with new stars, new solar systems, old and fading stars, etc., which all goes to show that there will be changes by the stellar influences on all the future generations.

The questions are:
Do we not have any responsibility to explore and study these influences for posterity? Should we not instill a scientific temperament so that we could set footprints on the sands of time for others to follow or find new paths to tread upon? Should we not hasten the pace of acquiring knowledge and set up an example for others to get involved in scientific research?
It is a very well-known fact that among the innumerable research projects are carried out all over the world only a few handful are pricked up for thorough study and investigation. Even among these few chosen ones, perhaps one idea could either revolutionize society through socifact, artifact or mentifact or speed up the pace of progress and development.
We are in race with time. Though we cannot turn the clock back, yet human willpower has shown time and again that the impossible can be achieved. Napoleon Bournaparte was of the opinion that the word “impossible” was only in the “dictionary of fools”. With him everything was considered on a war-footing basis. The history of the achiever’s fulfillment is littered with many failures in the past. Charles Goodyear got the formula for the tyre only after one thousand flop experiments. Despite all hindrances and disappointments he did not give up.
The use of fixed stars in astrology deals with human affairs which is a very delicate subject requiring deep and careful study by research and experience. At times knowledge does have its limits. During such helpless situations Dr. Albert Einstein’s direction through his experience with numerous failures and disappointments initially, is a real pointer to overcome these limitations. He says that vision beyond the horizon could open up new frontiers and expand knowledge. With this vision, friends, we could look ahead and commence this neglected study afresh for the benefit of mankind and the upliftment of the race.

THE USE OF FIXED STARS IN ASTROLOGY
- 318 Jyotisha Bharati Bharatitya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Prof. Anthony Writer
Mr. Shivanand Karkera
Mr. Shivanand Kerkera completed his B.com from Mumbai University in 2001. As the intricacies of computer software and hardware became a passion, he decided to persue a career in this. He secured a Diploma in Computer Hardware & Networking. After completing the course he was appointed as Network Administrator by Wipro InfoTech . Recently he passed the Microsoft certification exam, and is engaged in further studies in computer science and information technology..
At a very young, due to spiritual guidance from a competent teacher, he tries to spend some time from his heavy schedule in meditation and spiritual development with great eagerness to know the meaning of Life and its mysteries in depth. This metaphysical quest made him train his eyes on astrology and found much solace in it. His hardwork and dedication at Jyotisha Bharati saw him successfully completing the Jyotrivid Course and at the moment he is in the final year of the Jotishvisharda Course. Indian culture emphasizes : “Mata, Pita, Guru, Devam” and Mr. Karkera acknowledges: I got full support from my parents Mrs. Sarojini J. Karkera and Mr.Jagannath K. Karkera, and due to their blessings I have been able to study astrology and am successful in my career”.
He further states “Prof. Anthony Writer has always stood behind me as a guide in understanding various aspects of astrology and I feel fortunate to be part of his unique thesis on Fixed stars. The author by his unique research has indeed done a great service to the cause of astrology by bringing together all available information on the subject in this omnibus volume. I sincerely wish that this valuable work is accorded a warm welcome by all earnest students in India and abroad. I pray that the divine power that inspired the author to understand this project may grant him further opportunities to explore other promising fields of astrological research”.
