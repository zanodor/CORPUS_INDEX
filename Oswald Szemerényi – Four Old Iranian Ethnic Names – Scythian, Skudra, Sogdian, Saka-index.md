1.1. The Scythians make their first appearance in the 8th century B. C. in the South of Russia. According to some they had been living there from time immemorial1. But already Herodotus reported (IV 11) a version, according to which ,,the nomadic tribes of Scythians who lived in Asia, being hard pressed by the Massagetae, were forced across the Araxes into Kimmeria (what is now Scythia is said to have been once inhabited by Kimmerians)“, and most modern historians would agree that the Scythians arrived from Asia, fleeing before other westward pressing nomads and perhaps even before that protracted period of exceptional drought which according to Ellsworth Hunting ton set in around the year 800 B. C. and triggered off the westward movement of the barbarians2. This does not, of itself, decide the question whether their original homeland was in Asia or in Europe; in the latter case, we have to assume that they belonged to those Iranian tribes whose ancestors had migrated from Southern Russia to the steppes East of the Caspian and the Aral Sea, and who returned to Europe in the afore-mentioned circumstances3. 1.1.1. The immediate consequence of the invasion was the subju gation, or at least constant harassment, of the local population, the Iranian tribes of the Kimmerians4. Escaping the intolerable pressure,

part (?) of them crossed the Caucasus and invaded Urartu. The Assyrian king Sargon (722—704) learns from intelligence reports in 714 B. C. that Urartu had suffered a serious defeat at the hands of the Kimmerians. Under Sennacherib (703—681) they turn West and de stroy the Phrygian kingdom (696?), but around 679 B.C., under their king Teuspa, they suffer a crushing defeat from Esarhaddon’s army. The next major encounter brings them face to face with Gyges, king of Lydia (687—652), who is defeated by them and killed in battle (652). The Kimmerian chieftain Kobos, of execrable cruelty, was, in the time of King M&dyes (see presently), crushed by the Scythians, and this was the last to be heard of them in Anatolia4a. 1.1.2. Although, according to Herodotus (I 103), ,,the Scythians had entered Asia in pursuit of the Kimmerians whom they had expelled from Europe^, the first mention of them is made there almost half-acentury after the appearance of the Kimmerians. Under Esarhaddon (681—669) a barbarian chieftain, Bartatua (675—645 ?) by name, sued for the hand of a Ninevite princess. He is doubtless identical with Herodotus’ npwToOurjc, father of the Scythian king MaSuvjc; (645—615 ?). He, like I&pakai of the Asguzai people, an ally of the Manna, has to be placed in Sakasene, off the SW corner of the Caspian4b. From here the Scythians turned westward, and, as mentioned already, under Madyes defeated the Kimmerian chieftain Kobos. Between 630—620 B. C. the Scythians pillaged Syria, Palestine, and even the North of Egypt, but then were bought off by Psammetichus and returned to Anatolia. After the fall of Ninive (612 B.C.), Nabopolassar, king of Babylo nia, pursued the last Assyrian king, Assuruballit (612—609), and defeated him at Harran — in alliance with some Scythian forces, apparently from Cappadocia. But soon the Medes gained the upper hand, and the Scythians were forced to withdraw to Western Anatolia where they were finally crushed around 585 B. C.
4a According to the new results of M. COGAN & H. TADMOR, Orientalia 46, 1977, pp.65—85, and SPAL1NGER, The date of the death of Gyges, JAOS 98, 1977, pp. 400—408, and especially p. 408, the death of Gyges is to be dated 644 B.C.; it was brought about by the Kimmerians led by Lygdamis; Lygdamis died 640; a second sack of Sardis (but not of the citadel) by the allies of the Kimmerians, led by Kobos, took place in 637; they were driven out of Asia Minor by the Scythians (their first mention!) who a few years later (633/632) penetrated as far as Palestine. 4b Of.

Scythian
1.2. As can be seen, Kimmerians and Scythians were less than a century and a half south of the Causasus. During that relatively short period they were known to the local population, in particular to the Assyrians, as Gimirrai{a} and Askuzai, Askuzai, or Iskuzdi, iSkuza, respectively. The former is quite clearly the Biblical Gomer and the Greek Kiggspiot, but there can be little doubt that the latter also appears in the Old Testament, albeit in the corrupt form Ashkenaz, found at Genesis 10, 3, and Jeremiah 51, 27. The former passage is interesting inasmuch as it establishes a father-son relation between the two peoples: ,,And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah". But Jeremiah proves the identity in a different way. For the injunction ,,summon the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz4' shows that Ashkenaz is in close connection with Ararat = Urartu, and Minni, a people which we have met above (1.1.2.) as the allies of the Asguzai. It is clear that the corruption occurred in the scribal, not the oral tradition: the historically obscure ethnic Akwz was in its written form changed to 'Sknz, an easily understandable change seeing that in the development of Hebrew script the two letters were very similar in many variants of the script0. That the term Ashkenazim has come to mean ,Polish-German Jews', in contrast to Sephardim ,Spanish or Portuguese Jews' is a highly interesting semantic development but not relevant to our problem. 1.3. Seeing that the Near East had the distinctive names Gimirrai(a) and Askuzai for Kimmerians and Scythians, the question arises whether the Iranians themselves knew these names. As is known, Herodotus (VII 64) roundly declares: ot yap llepaac SxuOac; xaXeoucn. Saxa<;, ,,Sacae is the name the Persians give to all Scythian tribes". But here we must ask at once whether this statement is based on reliable information or whether it is an unjusti fied extrapolation from the fact that the Achaemenids only knew Sakas ?! 1.3.1. For this question a passage of Darius’ Bisutun inscription is of the greatest importance. In column V of that inscription a report is
See, e.g., J. FRIEDRICH, Geschichte der Schrift, Heidelberg 1966, plate 122.

given (V 21—30) of an expedition against the Saka6, ,wearing the pointed hat', who lived near a draya; their chieftain Skunxa was captured, and figures as the tenth on the Bisutun rock after a long row of rebellious adversaries of Darius, with a truly impressive pointed hat on his head. The territory of these Saka people was annexed.
6 I have shown (Acta Iranica 5 = Monumentum Nyberg II, Liege 1975, pp. 346—350) that, at the beginning of this report (lines 21—22), abiy Sakdm pasd... does not present an otherwise unknown Saka ‘Saka-land’ but is an unusual spelling (or misspelling), based on sandhi, of the m. ace. pl. Sakdn.

Oppenheim, Berlin 1933, pp. 157—169. 8 This already HlNZ, ZDMG 93 (1939), p.365f.; AMI 5 (1972), p. 251. 9 See HlNZ, Darius und die Perser, Baden-Baden 1976, pp. 182, 199f. On Soviet scholars who also placed the scene of the Saka-campaign in Asia, see I. M. ORANSKIJ, in: Istorija iranskogo gosudarstva i kuVtury, Moscow 1971, pp. 42—44.
Now Herodotus, as is known, also reports (IV 1, 83—98, 118144) a vast expedition against the Scythians which took his army across the Bosporus and the Danube at least to the Dniester. But owing to the scorched earth tactics of the Scythians the campaign was broken off, and the army returned the way it had come, empty-handed, and certainly without adding a province to the Empire. Historians have long tried to solve the riddle whether the Persian account refers to the same expedition as the Greek or not. Thus, e.g., A. Herrmann argued (1933) that the Persian account referred to the fourth or fifth year of Darius (517 or 516 B. C.) and therefore could not be identical with the Greek account which referred to 512 B.C. The former commemorated an expedition against the Asiatic Sakd tigraxaudd, the latter a campaign against the Sakd paradraya in the Crimea7. The same view, except for changes in the chronology, has been repeatedly advanced by W. Hinz. The draya is the river Oxus (modern Amu Darya)8, where Darius defeated the Saka tigraxauda; this happe ned in 519 B. C., while the campaign against the Scythians took place in 513 B.C.9. But the opposite view has not been without supporters either. Thus, e.g., Herzfeld maintained on various occasions that DB V referred to the Scythian campaign which took place in the Black Sea



Scythian 9
region in 512; the Saka para draya were accordingly to be placed in and near the Danube delta10.

TrUMPELMANN, Zur Entstehungsgeschichte des Monuments Dareios’ I. von Bisutun und zur Datierung der Einfuhrung der altpersischen Schrift, AA 1967, pp. 281—298, esp. 294, 297 (campaign 520/519, report 518 B.C.); and most recently J. WlESEHOFER, Der Aufstand Gaumdtas und die Anfdnge Dareios I., Bonn 1978, pp. 12f., 42, 226f., 229. 13 G. CAMERON, Darius the Great and his Scythian (Saka) campaign, Monumentum Nyberg I, Liege 1975, pp-77—88, esp. pp. 79, 87. 14 J. HARMATTA, Darius’ expedition against the Saka Tigraxauda, AAH 24 (1976), pp. 15—24. 10 An exception is HlNZ, AMI 5 (1 972), p. 246, but his d]rah[ta is, for Old Persian, hardly acceptable.
However, the most forcefully presented version of this thesis has been given by the American historian J. M. Balcer. In a paper entitled ,,The date of Herodotus IV. 1 — Darius’ Scythian expedition”11, he first tried to show that the so-called Tabula Capitolina which (II 2225) links the assassination of the tyrant Hipparchos with Darius’ Scythian campaign across the Kimmerian (I) Bosporos, and dates both to a year 528 = 513 B. C., “contains too many historical errors in col. II to be considered a sound document” (p. 103), although with reference to the death of Hipparchos, where the correct date, 514 B. C., is known, the Tabula is only one year out. Balcer also attempted to demonstrate (p. 116) that “the four ancient sources (Bisitun, Herodotus, Ktesias, and Polyaenos) do preserve in parallel reports the events of Darius’ reign from 522 to 518 B. C.”, and since the Saka campaign reported in DB V, now known to be dated to 519 B. C.12, in his view can only refer to the Western Sakas, he ended up with the conclusion (p. 131) that “every indication points to one [!] Scythian expedition in 519 into Europe”. In a thorough review of the evidence J. Harmatta convincingly showed that Balcer’s thesis, in the meantime hailed by Cameron13 as definitively proved, is quite simply untenable14. His main (Iranian) argument (p. 21 f.) is the observation that in DB V 24 the reading paraMrn, Kent’s emendation accepted almost unanimously15, is at variance with the facts. For, as is reported by Kent (OP 133 ad 23—4),



10 0. SZEMERENYI
Cameron read, i. e. saw on the rock, + raxa + a[. Harmatta maintains therefore (pp.22f.) that in DB V 22—28 it was reported that Darius arrived at a river (not at the Black Sea), crossed it, and beat Skunxa’s Sakas! The river was also named, for the signs quoted above are to be read as A}rax§a, another name of the River Oxus. The relevant passage is therefore to be read as follows 23 yadiy abiy draya a24 varasam araxsa nama rauta ava ha 25 yam. In concluding our discussion of Darius’ campaign against the (Eastern) Sakas it is perhaps worth mentioning — since it seems to have gone unnoticed — that Herodotus (I 201—214) credits Cyrus the Great (559—529 B.C.) with a similar exploit against the Massagetae; his report is couched in surprisingly similar terms: “(201) After the conquest of Assyria, Cyrus’ next desire was to subdue the Massagetae, whose country lies far to the eastward beyond the Araxes... What the Araxes is like is not clear — some say it is, bigger than the Danube, others that it is not so big...” “(205) At this time Tomyris was queen of the Massagetae, having succeeded to the throne on her husband’s death. Cyrus sent to her and pretended to sue for her hand in marriage; but he was met with a refusal... Cyrus, therefore, ... turned to open force, and advancing to the Araxes began his assault upon the Massagetae by bridging the river for his men to cross and constructing upperworks on the ferry boats”. Shortly after (208) Cyrus “crossed the river with his army”. Seeing that the campaign of Cyrus took place in 529 B.C., and Darius’ in 519 B.C., that is barely ten years later, the question arises whether the two events are causally connected? Did Darius wish to avenge the death of Cyrus who had been killed in battle by the Massagetae ? Or is it conceivable that Herodotus’ report is a projection onto Cyrus of Darius’ feat ? But this is surely ruled out by the fact that Cyrus’ expedition is reported by Strabo also (XI, 8, 6), both probably deriving from Hekataios16.
16 See for this and other problems F. LASSERRE in the Bude edition of Strabo (Paris 1975), pp. 86 with fn. 1—2, and notes complementaires ad p. 86, 87.
1.3.2. Whatever the explanation of this curious coincidence, there can be little doubt that DB V reports a campaign of the Persians against the Eastern Sakas. The report, which calls these people Saka,



Scythian 11
is therefore of no use when it comes to deciding whether the Persians knew some other name for the (Western) Scythians. Unfortunately, there is no Persian record of Darius’ campaign (reported by Herodotus and others) against the (Western) Scythians. But there are several lists which enumerate the provinces or peoples of the empire17, and it has often been suggested that they might be of help in our inquiry. For our purposes they can be evaluated as follows.
17 Of. Kent, The lists of-provinces, JNES 2 (1943), pp.302—306; KENT, OP, pp. 56—57 ; WALSER, o. c. [fn. 10], pp. 27f.; BALCER, o. c. [fn. 11 ], pp. 123f.; GlGNOUX, in: HARMATTA (ed.), Prolegomena to the sources on the history of preIslamic Central Asia, Budapest 1979, pp. 138—139. 18 This was done by CAMERON., JNES 2 (1943), pp.307f.; BALCER, o.c., p. 123. 19 I. N. KHLOPIN, Zur DPe-Inschrift ZZ. 13—15, Orientalia Lovaniensia Periodica 4 (1973), pp. 113—119, argued (esp. p. 1 18) that the current reading (11.14—15) uta dahyava tya para draya, due to Cameron (see fn. 18), was erroneous, and that we should return to the earlier reading and interpretation:
( 1) In the Bisutun inscription (1, 16f.; 2, 8; 5, 21—31; DBk 2) Saka quite clearly always denotes the Eastern Scythians. ( 2) In one of the Persepolis inscriptions (DPe) the list contains after the central provinces and Egypt the following: 12 Armina, Katpatuka, Sparda, Ya13 una tyaiy uskahya uta tya1 4 iy drayahya uta dahyava t15 ya para draya, Asagarta, ParOava, Zra 16 ka and then the other Eastern provinces, amongst them also Hi(n)du&, Ga(n)ddra, Saka, Maka.
As can be seen, after the Asianic peoples we find mentioned the lonians of the land (i. e. Asia Minor) and the sea (i. e. the islanders) and lands overseas, followed by Eastern peoples only. The most natural construction to put on the lands overseas would, of course, be to regard them as lands on the Balkans, perhaps even mainland Greece. It is certainly unfounded in the context to identify them with the (Western) Scythians18, simply because in another, late, inscription (DNa 28—9) Sakd tyaiy paradraya are named; for, with the same logic, we might argue that they are to be taken for Yauna tyaiy paradraya because they are named in two inscriptions (DSe and XPh, see presently). But even if the (Western) Scythians were meant, we could not determine what form their name had — which is the only important question from our point of view19.

(3) In Darius’ Susa inscription concerning the Restoration of Order in the Empire, Kent gives (DSe 21—30) a list which is “restored by retranslation from the Akkadian version”. According to his text, after the central and eastern provinces (including the Eastern Saka haumavargd and Saka tigraxauda) come
27 Armina, Katpatuka, Sparda, Yaun28 a tyaiy drayahya uta tyai 29 y paradraya, Skudra... In other words, in this part of the list, we have the same sequence as in (2) above, except that the lonians of Asia Minor seem to have been overlooked (or omitted), and the "lands overseas’ are resolved into "lonians across the sea’ and Skudra, or possibly into "people (not loanians!) across the sea and Skudra’. But a quite novel situation has arisen through the recent appea rance of some further fragments of this inscription. According to the editor20, the passage should now be reconstituted as follows:
dahyava tyd parauvaya ‘the lands (which are) in the East’, introducing the thirteen Eastern provinces then enumerated. Khlopin’s main argument is that Cameron’s reading introduces an unusual phrase; but the reading advocated by him is also unique! If, however, his reading should prove right, the linguistic problem is easily solved. Khlopin reads para uvaya, admitting (p. 119) that uvaya ""sich anscheinend nicht erklaren laBt”. But we would have to read parauviya (not paruvaiy as AiWb 871), i. e. fem. pl. parviyah of par(u)v(x‘eastern’, required by the fem. dailyu-. 20 See Steve, Stir 3 (1974), pp. 8f., esp. 13 and 24f. — MAYRH0FER, Supplement zur Sammlung der altpersischen Inschriften, Vienna 1978, p. 14, reports the new finds but without mentioning that Steve restores (28) Saka tyaiy!
27 Armina, Katpatuka, Sparda, Yauna 28 tyaiy drayahya, Saka tyaiy 29 paradraya, Skudra, Yauna tyaiy 30 paradraya, Karka. (Jatiy Dara ... But it is worth pointing out that even now only (29) Yauna, and (30) Odtiy are attested. To be sure, the Akkadian version presents (Steve, p.23): 20 [mat Sa-]parda matYa[m]ana sa ina A.A.BA [matGimirri sa] 21 ina nibirtum narmarratum asbu raatIskudur mat[Yamana] 22 matKarsa, that is to say Sparda, lonians in the sea, [Saka ?) across the saltwater, Skudra, [Ionia?], Karka. The lonians are the second time not specified at all, and quite possibly Gimirri and Yamana should be interverted so



Scythian 13
that the sequence would be Sparda, lonians of the islands, lonians overseas, Skudra, [? Saka ?], Karka. In any case, once again, if the (Western) Scythians were mentio ned at all. we have no evidence to show how they were named in the inscription. (4) With Darius’ list in the Naqs-i-Rustam inscription (DNa) we have at last firm ground under our feet. After the main central and eastern provinces (including the Saka haumavarga and tigraxauda) we find 28 Katpatuka, Sparda, Yauna, Saka tyaiy [pa-] 29 radraya, Skudra, Yauna takabara, Put[a]y30 a, Kusiya, Maciya, Karka, that is, after the lonians of Asia Minor, there come the Saka across the sea, the Skudra, the petasos-wearing lonians, Libyans, Ethiopians, men of Maka, Carians. This time we seem to have clear evidence that the (Western) Scythians were (also? see 3.4.) named Saka. (5) Xerxes’ daiva-inscription at Persepolis (XPh) presents a very full list comprising thirty peoples of the realm, although in a very disorganised kind of fashion: after Arachosia comes Armenia, after Hindus Katpatuka, etc. . Of the peoples relevant to our inquiry the following are named:
21
22
21 KENT, 1943 [fn. 17], p. 303, gets 31 peoples by counting 3 groups of lonians but this cannot be right. Of. WALSER, o.c. [fn. 10], p.39. 22 Cf. WALSER, o.c. [fn. 10], pp. 39f. 23 The labels are, in contrast to Kent’s hesitation, attributed to Artaxerxes II by WALSER, o.c. [fn. 10], p.52, but to Artaxerxes III? at p.34.
23 Yauna tya[iy] drayahiya da24 rayatiy uta tyaiy paradraya darayat25 iy, Maciya, Arabaya, Gadara, Hidus, 26 Katpatuka, Daha, Saka haumavarga, Saka 27 tigraxauda, Skudra, Akaufaciya, 28 Putaya, Karka, Kusiya. Oatiy... As can be seen, in our area twro kinds of lonians are named, and the Skudra. There is no mention of Sakd paradraya.
(6) The throne-bearer labels at Persepolis (A?P), ascribed to Artaxerxes II (405—359 B. C.) or III (359—338 B. C.) , also add up to an (almost) complete list of thirty peoples (Kent, OP 155f.). Relevant are :

14 iyam Saka haumavarga 15 iyam Saka tigraxafuda] 23 iyam Yauna 24 iyam Saka paradraiya 25 iyam Skudra 26 iyam Yauna takabara. Here again, the Western Scythians seem clearly attested as Saka paradraiya.
1. 3.3. The name of the Saka occurs in a few more inscriptions. (7 ) In a Persepolis inscription Darius gives a comprehensive description of the magnitude of his realm (DPh 5—8): 5 haca Sakaibis tyaiy para 6 Sugdam amata yata a Kusa, 7 haca Hidauv amata yata a Spa 8 rda “from the Scythians who are beyond Sogdiana, from there unto Ethiopia; from Sind — from there unto Sardes”. The reference is clearly to the Eastern Sakas. (8) In an inscription of Hamadan (DH 4—6), we find a verbatim repeated description of the realm. (9) The discovery at Susa on 24th December, 1972, of an “over life-size stone statue of Darius the Great”, brought not only “the first large-scale fragment of a free-standing Achaemenian statue”, “an example of a hitherto unknown Egyptianizing type of Achaemenian royal sculpture; and an important new document for the study of Persian dress”, but also, on the two lateral faces of the large rectangu lar base, two rows of kneeling persons, personifying 2 x 12 = 24 peoples of the empire, with their names written in hieroglyphic Egyptian in a cartouche under each figure24. This hieroglyphic “list of provinces” had been known before from fragments of four stelae erected on Darius’ orders on his own Suez Canal connecting the Red Sea and the Nile. But the new Susa find presents for the first time a complete copy of the list25.
24 For general information see M. KERVRAN, JA 260 (1973), pp. 235 f.; on the statue, D. STRONACH, ibid. pp. 240f. (from whom the quotes in the text are taken); on the Egyptian list of provinces, J.

From our point of view, the important fact is that after the heart lands and the Eastern provinces the list names 12 Les Saka des marais et les Saka des plaines 13 Babylone 14 L’Armenie 15 Sardes 16 La Cappadoce 17 Skudra. Before this discovery it was thought that the Saka of the marshes and the Saka of the plains might correspond to the division into tigraxauda and haumavarga2^. But Balcer opined2276 that “the Scy thians of the Eastern plains-steppe regions... are the Amyrgian [ = haumavarga] Saka... The Scythians of the marshes... may well be the Scythians dwelling in the marshes of lake Maiotis” [my Italics, OSz.], although he had noted (fn. 84) that, according to Posener, “la position du no. 12 a la fin du groupe des pays orientaux interdit de voir dans SK PH [ = Saka of the marshes] la Scythie au nord de la mer Noir”.
o. c., 258 fn. 6, notes that : “Les reliefs de la base permettront de preciser ou de modifier les conclusions formulees par G. Walser... (1966)” but I don’t know of any such treatment, although it might obviously bring important results. 26 This was Posener’s view, cf. WALSER, o.c. [fn. 10], p. 32 fn. 16. 27 See Balcer, o.c. [fn. 11], p. 127. 28 Cf. CAMERON, The Persian satrapies and related matters, JNES 32 (1973), pp. 47—56, esp. p. 55 fn.48. 29 See Cameron, o.c. [fn. 13], pp. 84—85.
An even more radical transposition was about the same time advocated by Cameron28: “Despite the evident intention of the scribe to indicate that two Sakas were here being indicated, I submit that the evidence to prove that these are the two north-eastern Saka is inconclusive”. And when we consider that “the lands beyond the Sea” in DPe [our no. (2) above] “become none other than ‘the lonians who are beyond the Sea’ of DSe (also XPh) [our nos. (3) and (5)] and the ‘Saka who are beyond the Sea’ of DNa [our no. (4)] ... then the Saka of the Suez inscriptions must in all probability be the Scythians in Europe"". [My Italics, OSz.] But in spite of this forceful argumentation, within a year or so Cameron managed to achieve a complete volte-face29. In 1975 he just as emphatically declared that the assumption that the hieroglyphic Saka might be “the Western or European. Saka” — his own previous



16 O.SZEMERfiNYI
suggestion — “would be erroneous, as another Egyptian text demon strates conclusively”. This text is of course the inscription on the Darius statue, and it leads to the following ingenious suggestion. No. 12 in the hieroglyphic list has so far been read as SK PH SK T?, that is as naming two groups of Sakas. But, says Cameron, “it now
appears that No. 12 had best be rendered as SK PH SKTn and translated as The Saka who are in back of (encroaching on) the Sogdian land’ ”, skU here being merely a variant of skdy ‘Sogdia’, listed under no. 7. The upshot of this hieroglyphic interlude is then, whether we accept Posen er’s argument or Cameron’s interpretation, that the hieroglyphic list does not mention the European Scythians. 1.3.4. Summing up, we can say that of the nine inscriptions discussed in this section only two, i. e. (4) and (6), refer by name to the Western Scythians, and that in the form Saka tyaiy paradraya and Saka paradraiya respectively.
1.4. Even though the relevant evidence is thus reduced to two occurrences, that would seem to be sufficient to corroborate Herodo tus’ statement that the Persians called all Scythians Saka. But this at once poses the question: where did the Assyrian and Hebrew sources get the name a^kuza/iskuza from? The obvious answer is, at least for the Assyrians: from the invading Scythians themselves. Whereupon a further question arises: is there any evidence that this name was known in other (non-Persian) areas also ? 1.4.1. The answer to this question seems fairly clear. Since the variation in the initial vowel in askuza/i^kuza points to a prothetic vowel — which no doubt did not exist in the source language — that is to say the name was simply skuza, it is hardly possible to avoid the conclusion that this name is connected with, is in fact identical with the Greek name XxcOyc The Greek name was known already to Hesiod (circa 700 B.C.), cf. the line quoted by Eratosthenes in Strabo 7, 3, 7: AiOiOKat; ts Aiftuc ts iSs SxuOocc; This is important inasmuch as, the Ionic-Attic change u>u being datable around 600 B. 0., the form (and not Sxo60y<; or SxoOt^) can still reflect a source-form with u30.

But what could be the Iranian form that was borrowed into Assyrian (and from there into Hebrew) as (a)£kuza and into Greek as
It was at first thought that the Iranian form was *Sku6a3{ , and it is undeniable that in early Greek renderings of Iranian names Greek 0 can represent Iranian d, cf. = OP Aspatana, Tel<37zric = OP Ci&piA. But it is no less true that in Akkadian transcriptions Iranian d appears as d, possibly also s but not as z, and the same applies to Aramaic loanwards (which is relevant for Hebr. ’§kwz)3321, And the
phonetically impossible prototype *Sku6a was by no means improved by ascribing to it the meaning "scalp hunter’33.
31 See MARKWART, Philologus Suppiementband X (1905), p. 112; followed by HERZFELD, e.g. AMI 1 (1929), p. 104 fn. 1. J ignore here the attempt of V. Miller (Jazyk Osetin, Moscow 1962, p. 76, § 50, 7), accepted by ALTHEIMST1EHL, o.c. [fn.55], p. 635, to explain SxuOat as the Hellenized form of the plural *sku-t(je from singular saka; even the borrowed form could not have lost the first-syllable vowel at that early date, and the suggestion does not account for Near Eastern z. 32 For the problems of these sound correspondences cf. ElLERS, ZDMG 94 (1940), p. 215 fn. 1 ; BELARDI, Ricerche Linguistiche 2 (1960), pp. 177f.; TELEGDI, JA 226 (1935), p.205. 33 This was suggested by MARKWART, Gaucasica 6/1 (1930), pp. 58f. 34 Cf. VAN Windekens, BzN 1 (1949), pp. 101 f. 30 This was first suggested by me (in Hungarian) in : Magyar Nyelv 43 (1947), pp. 113f.; and a few years later (in English) in: ZDMG 101 (1951) pp. 214f.
Another suggestion would trace the name of the Scythians to Iran. *Skuf)a~, interpreted as derived from IE *skeu- "perceive, observe, watch’, and meaning "gardeur(s) (de troupeaux)’34. But here again the existence of the Near Eastern forms is ignored, and they are incompa tible with the suggested Iranian form. 1.4.2. As I pointed out over thirty years ago, the two loan-forms skuth- and skuz- demand a prototype in which the final consonant was voiced (to explain z) and not an occlusive (to explain the Greek aspirate), or, to put it in a positive form, it was a voiced spirant; this means that the Iranian prototype required by the two loan-forms was *Skuda-35.
That the Greeks rendered a foreign spirant with an aspirate is particularly well-known from the cases in which an Iranian f is represented by a Greek <p, i. e. ph; cf. the numerous names with Iranian farnah- rendered in Greek by cpapv- or cpepvv^ sim. Likewise, an Iranian

p was rendered by f), cf. such names as riap0o<;. That languages which do not possess spirants but do have aspirates are bound to use these as substitutes is very clearly exemplified by Skt. vardhanam Town’ also, which was borrowed from Iran, *vrdana~. But in the case of a voiced spirant, a Greek speaker had to resort to a less straightforward kind of substitution because he did not possess these sounds in the first half of the first millennium B. C. A simple 8 for the foreign d was inadequate, seeing that even a foreign d (in initial position) was often rendered by t, cf. the name of the river Don: Iran. DanvA but Greek Tdcv-ai^ (from ^Danaw-d-s'l). To approximate the voiced spirant of the original, the voiceless aspirate had to be used, and that is what led to Sxu9t)<;. That in the Semitic languages the foreign voiced spirant d was rendered by z was for their system also quite natural since at that time — in the early seventh century B. C. — the intervocalic spirantization (the so-called begadkefat-rule) had not begun yet36.
36 See SZEMERENYI, Acta Iranica 12 (1977), pp. 367f. — It is gratifying to see that this argument and the basic form *Skuba- have subsequently been discovered (or taken over from me?) by Soviet scholars. Cf. E. A. GRANTOVSKU, Rannjaja istorija iranskix piemen perednej Azii, Moscow 1970, p. 89, who depends on I. M. DJAK0N0V, Istorija Midii, Moscow 1956, pp. 242f. (whose work became available only after completion of this paper). 37 It is quite unjustifiable to claim an Assyrian source for the Greek form as is, tentatively, suggested by H.KOTHE, Klio 51 (1969), p. 75.
1.4.3. Having established that the Iranian prototype, borrowed in dependently by Assyrians and Greeks, was *Skuba~, we must now ask whether this name can be interpreted. As we have seen, 'scalp hunter' or "shepherd’ have been suggested but on insufficient grounds, and with complete disregard for what we know about the Scythians.

What struck the Greeks most about these nomadic people was their incredibly rapid movements — they rode from early childhood and their superb accomplishments as archers. Both qualities are sum med up in a passage of Herodotus where it is said (VI 112) that, at Marathon, ""the Athenians advanced at a run towards the enemy, not less than a mile away. The Persians, seeing the attack developing at the double, prepared to meet it confidently enough, for it seemed to them suicidal madness for the Athenians to risk an assault with so small a force — at the double, too, and with no support from either cavalry or archers” (: opwvTe^ ocutou<; EovTac; oXiyouc;, xat toutouc; Spogco STtEiyOgEVOU^ OUTS L7U7TOU UTtap/OUCTT^ OCpt OUTS TOCEUyaTOv). The same combined observation is expressed by Herodotus in



Scythian 19
another passage (IV 46) where he explains how the Scythians managed to ensure their own preservation: “A people without fortified towns, living, as the Scythians do, in waggons which they take with them wherever they go, accustomed, one and all, to fight on horseback with bows and arrows, and dependent for their food not upon agriculture but upon their cattle: how can such a people fail to defeat the attempt of an invader not only to subdue them, but even to make contact with them?“ The words italicized (by me) are a laborious rendering of Herodotus’ felicitous single word: ltcttoto^otou, an admirable summing up of the essential Scythian warrior. That Scythians could not be thought of without bows and arrows is, last not least, confirmed by the well-known fact that the Athenian police force was known as LxuOat or To^orat, the two terms obviously being interchangeable because identical in their denotatum38.
38 Cf. H. BELLEN, in: Der Kleine Pauly 5, Stuttgart 1979, p. 242. 39 See POTRATZ, o.c. [fn.2], p.22. 40 Cf. K. J. Narr, in: Abriss der Vorgeschichte, Munich (Oldenbourg) 1957, p. 69. 41 The quotations are taken from M. A. DANDAMAJEV, in: HARMATTA (ed.), Prolegomena [fn. 17], p. 106.
This characterization of the Scythians found in the literary sources is borne out by the archaeological finds. It is a commonplace to say that: “Die eigentliche Waffe... fur diese... Reiter waren Pfeil und Bogen”39, or, with greater precision, that: “Das Reitervolk der Skythen kennzeichnet die Bewaffnung mit zusammengesetztem Reflexbogen und Pfeilen, die ‘ostliche’ dreiflugelige Spitze haben”40. No wonder their weaponry made impression and spread far and wide. As the Soviet archaeologist B. B. Piotrovsky states, in the 7th c. B. C. we find in the Near East “bronze arrow-heads of a characteristic form, ... dif fering from the usual Near Eastern arrow-heads but with regard to their form identical with the Scythian ones; ... it is very likely that these bronze arrow-heads came to the Near East together with the Kimmerians and Scythians in the 7th century”. We are also well informed about the spread of this armament: “In the course of the 7th—6th centuries B.C., the "Scythian’ arrows rapidly spread in Transcaucasia, Asia Minor, Babylon and Assyria, Syria and Palestine, Iran and Central Asia where finds of bronze arrow-heads of the Scythian type have been made”41. These findings of the archaeologist are corroborated by cuneiform records of the sixth century B. C. A document of 541 B. C., originating



20 0. SZEMERENYI
from the temple archive of Eanna in Uruk, lists amongst others “200 Kimmerian reed arrows, 180 of them with bronze tips, 1 Kimmerian bow”, and “20 reed arrowrs, 12 with arrow-heads, 1 Kimmerian bow”, and another document of 541, likewise from Uruk, mentions, in detailing the equipment of eight archers, spears, daggers, shields, Akkadian bows, and “56 Akkadian arrows, 26 of them with iron tips, and 116 Kimmerian arrows, 46 of them with iron tips”42.
42 See E. SALONEN, Die Waffen der alten Mesopotamier, Helsinki 1965, pp. 117f.; Dandamajev, o. c., pp. 99f. 43 Cf.

It must, of course, be borne in mind that Kimmerian., Akkadian gimirraia, in the Akkadian of this period, as later in the Achaemenid inscriptions, no longer means Kimmerian proper but simply Scythian. 1.4.4. If, thus, the main characteristic of the Scythian is, for Greeks as much as for the various peoples of the Near East, that he is a superb archer, then the comparatist will at once see that the name Skuba, or simply Skuda, is closely related to a well-known Germanic group. It may be recalled first that a Germanic n-stem *skutjan- (m.) is attested by OE scytta "a shooter, an archer; Sagittarius’, ON skyti "a marksman, shooter, archer’, OHG scuzzo ’(modern Germ.) Schiitze’. This noun is derived from the amply attested verb *skeutan, cf. OE sceotan "shoot, cast a missile; move an object rapidly, push; (intr.) move rapidly, dart, rush’; ON skjota "shoot (with a weapon), push or shove quickly; (intr.) shoot, start, move"; OHG sciozan "iaculari, sagittare, ferire; (>mod.) schiessen’. This verb is not attested in Wulfila’s Gothic but it is recorded for Crimean Gothic as schieten "sagittam mittere’. From the intransitive use of the verb we have the adjective *skeutor-, cf. ON skgotr "swift, fleet’, OE sceot "quick, ready’, no doubt a late formation. This Germanic group naturally presupposes an IE root *skeudwhich is without doubt attested in Lithuanian skudrus "swift’, and Skt. tod(ay)ati "drive, incite’, possibly also in OSlav kydati "throw’. Further more, it is very likely that IE *skeu- "throw, shoot; push’ in Lithu. sduti "shoot (with a weapon)’ and OS sovati "push, shove’ is the basis of our *skeud~ also43.



Scythian 21
Proto-Iranian *Skuda-, later *Skuda~, thus represents a nomen agentis formed with the thematic suffix -o- from the nil-grade of the IE root *skeud-, i. e. IE *skud-o- ‘shooter, archer’. This interpretation was, as far as I can see, first given implicitly by Justi: “Das Volk, welches die Hellenen mit dem skythischen Worte Skythen (SCHUTZEN, iKKOTo^ovai Hdt.) benannten.. .”44. It was taken up (or rediscovered?) by Vasmer but with a curious proviso: the suggestion “liesse sich aber nur halten, wenn in ein er Nachbarsprache, etwa im Thrakischen, so ein Wort nachgewiesen wiirde”4° — as if Thracian could have a decisive vote in the matter. It was then revived by myself on two occasions, and provided with, I believe, a solid foundation. It is now also accepted by Abajev, even if with a surprising twist46, and, at least formally, by Djakonov and Grantovskij (see fn. 36). It can only be hoped that the arguments advanced above (and below) will lead to its being generally accepted. It is intrinsically convincing, and gains further support from the name of the Saxons: Gmc. Sahsd, from sahsa- ‘knife, sword’, described the members of this tribe as ‘provided with a sword, bearing a sword’.
44 Justi, o.c. [fn. 1], p.441. — 1 see from J. W. Blakesley’s note in his Herodotus edition, vol. I, London 1854, p. 440 that this had already been advanced before his time.

46 ABAJEV, o.c. [fn. 1], p.25, but skut is regarded by him as a name imposed on the Scythians by their old Germanic neighbours. But this could not account for askuz!
1.4.5. But at this juncture a further point has to be taken into account. To add to our confusion, as it were, Herodotus not only reports, as we have seen, that with the Persians all Scythians went by the name Saka, but also (IV 6) that all Scythians are amongst themselves known under the comprehensive name Skolotai — after their king’s name —, and it is only the Greeks who call them Scythians (: <yug7uacn eIvocl ouvoga SxoXotou^, tod BocchXeoc ETcawupvQV. SxuOoc; 8e r<EXX7]VE<; ouvogaaav). The king, from whom the Skolotai are here said to have their name, is not named by Herodotus. But further on in Book IV Herodotus gives a detailed account of King SxuXr^ (IV 76f., esp. 78). He was the son of Ariapeithes, king of the Scythians, and, upon the death of his father, succeeded to the throne.

Now it is obvious that Skules and Skolotai are closely linked, especially if we bear in mind that in the first vowel cannot have been u since the Iranian-speaking Scythians did not have that sound, and that the o of Skolotai cannot have been the Scythian sound either since it was unknown to their vowel system. Obviously, both names had an Iranian u, i. e. sounded Skula- and Skulata respectively ; particularly important is in this context the name of King Scolopitus, preserved for us by lustinus, since, although its second component can hardly be pita ‘father’, it is clear that its first part represents Skula-^^ 1.4.6. This means that the Greeks’ and Assyrians’ name for the Scythians represents an Iranian Skuda while the Scythians called themselves Skula. Do we have to assume, then, that these two names have nothing to do with each other , or is there some other way out of this dilemma?

[fn. 45 (1 971)], p. 150. — From our point of view it is unimportant whether -ta in Skolotai is a plural morpheme or not, and this point will not be discussed; but cf. Christensen, o.c. [fn.82], p.68; Bailey, TPS (1945), p.25f.; Abajev, o.c. [fn.89], 1949, pp.218f.; Sims—Williams, BSOAS 42, 1979, pp. 337—346. 48 This is Kothe’s view, o. c. [fn. 37], p. 75: “Die Skoloten haben sich selbst niemals als LxuOat bezeichnet, sondern sie wurden lediglich von den Griechen mit diesem aus ganz anderer... Quelle stammenden Namen belegt”.
49 Cf. HARMATTA, Studies in the history and language of the Sarmatians, Szeged 1970, pp.77f., 81, 89f.
In answer to this question we must first note that I in Skula cannot be original, i. e. cannot represent IE I because this had changed to r in Iranian. To be sure, in Sarmatian, that is certainly after the third century B. C., I developed from an earlier cluster ry, cf. the name of the Alani from aryandm or aryana- (i. e. ary->al-) or ’'HXpavoc; from aryaman- ‘mate’ (i. e. ary-> el-), or by the sequence fri- developing into O-49But in Scythian, in Herodotus’ time, such changes are unknown. On the other hand, the fact that the descendants of Kolaxais, the Scythian kings, are called Paralatai (Hdt. IV 6), and this corresponds to Avestan para-data- ‘voran, an die Spitze gestellt’, proves that intervocalic -d- (or -<)-), at least in some parts of the Scythian linguistic territory had changed by Herodotus’ time to I. This shows that a form Skula- of Herodotus’ time must be traced to an earlier Skuda. In other words, the apparent contrast between



Skudra 23
fifth-century B. C. Skula and Skuda disappears, both continue an early SkudaoQ. The relation of the two forms is a matter of chronology and geography: when the Greeks first met the Scythians (8th or 7th century B. 0. ?), they heard the form * Skuda- from which they formed their own as the Assyrians formed their own askuz-\ when, some time later, they penetrated further inland, they heard the innovated Skula-, which they represented as ZzeX^c or SxoXo-Tat. 2. It would appear, then, that the Persians knew only the name Saka, even for the Western Scythians, but their predecessors in empire building, the Assyrians, and the Greeks, both of whom made contact with these Scythians before the Persians, had knowledge of an indige nous term Skuda. But this simple (or simplified) picture may stand in need of correction as is suggested by the following observations. 2.1. As we have seen, in various province lists, in which lonians and/or Sakas are mentioned, there is also mention of a people or region called Skudra. (1) Thus, in one of Darius’ Susa inscriptions, DSe — cf. 1.3.2. (3) above — Kent restores the following sequence: Sardes — lonians of the sea and those across the sea — Skudra Libyans — Ethiopians — Carians, while Steve has: Sardes — lonians of the sea — Saka overseas — Skudra lonians across the sea — Carians. Although most of these ethnic names are not preserved but restored (mainly with the help of DNa), the name of the Skudra is attested in the Akkadian version. (2) The new province list on the base of the Darius-statue — cf. 1.3.3. (9) above — makes no mention of the Western Scythians, nor, for that matter, of lonians of any kind (!), but does list the Skudra,
although in a surprising sequence : Sardes — Cappadocia — Skudra, — Syria (?) — Arabia — Egypt — Libya. (3) Darius’ Naqs-i-Rustam list — see 1.3.2. (4) above -— gives Sardes — lonians — Saka across the sea — Skudra — PetasosWearing lonians.

(4) Xerxes’ list in the daiva-inscription — cf. 1.3.2. (5) above has the sequence Sardes — Egypt —- lonians of the sea and those across the sea ... Saka h. — Saka t. — Skudra — men of Akaufaka... The Western Scythians are not mentioned but the Skudra are named. (5) Of the throne-bearers in A?P — cf. 1.3.2. (6) above — the following are of interest (21—-26): Cappadocian — Sardian — Ionian — Saka across the sea — Skudrian — Petasos-Wearing Ionian. Here the Skudra are clearly associated with the Western Scythians. 2.2. As can be seen, the Skudra are (for the time bing) mentioned in five lists. In two — nos. (3) and (5) above — they appear together with lonians and Western Scythians; in one — no. (4) — they are in the company of lonians but the Western Scythians are not mentioned; in one — no. (2) — they appear on their own, i. e. unaccompanied by either lonians or Western Scythians; finally, in one — no. (1) — the position is (at present?) unclear, we cannot be sure that the Skudra were accompanied by the lonians only, and not by the Western Scythians also. But, all in all, the evidence definitely suggests that the Skudra were closely associated with lonians and Western Scythians, and therefore that they were somewhere on the Balkans. J usti seems to have been the first to suggest that the Skudra lived in Macedonia01. According to Kent Skudra is probably Thrace and Macedonia32, and this view seems to be shared by all modern authors. But Justi’s idea is based solely on the assonance of the place name Skydra (Sxu8pa) in the Macedonian province Eordaia, and is historical ly and politically an absurdity. Skydra was and always remained an unimportant little village. When the Macedonians03, coming from the South-West, moved into the mountainous region of Eordaia, they first occupied Aigai, later known as Edessa, which became the seat of their kings and the centre of the growing nation. The capital was first transferred to Pella by King Archelaos (413—399 B.C.). When King Amyntas I in 513 acknowledged the suzerainty of Darius the Great, he was still residing in Aigai. In these circumstances there was absolutely

Skudra 25
no reason why the Persians should at any time — whether during the Scythian campaign or their march down to Marathon — name their new province — incorporating, in the main, Thrace (?) — after a paltry little place like Skydra. Throughout their empire they never wavered in their practice of naming their provinces after well-known tribes or after even better known towms. 2.3. After establishing this negative point, we can now turn to a positive aspect of the matter, which seems to have gone unnoticed so far. To immortalize his memory, and the greatness of his achieve ments, Darius the, Great ordered that the peoples of his empire, represented by throne-bearers in relief, should adorn his tomb at Naqsi-Rustam. Thirty throne-bearers became the standard complement even for the tombs of his successors, and like rare plants and animals in our arboreta and museums, they were provided with little labels (engraved in cuneiform signs, of course) to identify their nationality. They are now most easily accessible in Walser’s Die Volkerschaften [see fn. 10], cf. esp. pp. 51 f., and Falttafel No. 1. What interests us here is that the figures are presented almost naturalistically, with every detail of their apparel, weapons, and coiffure carefully observed. Nevertheless, not infrequently several figures display the same dress and equipment, which is no doubt what happened in real life also in neighbouring areas. Walser (pp.55f.) distinguishes eight types, and gives the following description of type IV: „Langarmeliger, eng anliegender, gegurteter Leibrock, uber der Brust ausgeschnitten, unten frackartig abgerundet, an den inneren Randern Borten, vielleicht Pelzfutter anzeigend; lange und weite Hosen, an den Knocheln geschnurt; auf dem Kopf Baschlik mit Spitze und Ohrenklappen; Akinakes“. The representatives of this type, which Walser simply labels „Sogder-Skythen are as follows: 7. Sogdians 8. Xvarazmians 14. Saka haumavarga 15. Saka tigraxauda 24. Saka paradraya 25. Skudra. 2.4. The reliefs thus reveal that the Skudra belong with the Sakas and Sogdians. Since for the Western Sakas (Scythians) we could establish



26 0. SZEMERENYI
that they designated themselves as Skuda, there can be no doubt that the Skudra were related to them, not only in their dress but also in their name! In other words, Skudra is Skud-ra, a derivative of the name of the Scythians. Cf. Av. suxrar- ‘red’ from *suk- (see 3.6. (c) (1) below); bdzu-ra- from bazu~ ‘arm’, Khot. maysda-ra- ‘nipple’ from *mazda~.
2.5. With this linguistic interpretation of their name we get for the first time a clear indication as to where to look for their habitat. It was obviously not in the mountainous regions of Eordaia but essentially on the Western coast of the Black Sea, north of Byzantium, i. e. from the point where Darius set up two stelae to commemorate the size of his armies (Hdt. IV 87), probably up to the Danube-delta, which, as is stated by Herodotus (IV 99), was the line separating the Skuda, the Western Scythians. How far inland the province extended cannot, of course, be determined, but there can be little doubt that it came to the empire as a result of the Scythian campaign of 514/513 B.C. The province of the Skudra, thus, was essentially European Turkey and the Eastern part of modern Bulgaria, that part of the Eastern Balkans which on maps of the ancient world goes by the name of Thracia04; in all probability it did not include any part of Macedonia00. 3. Sogdiana, the Greek and Latin name of the province known to Achaemenid Iran as Sug(u)da, was, broadly speaking, situated between the rivers Oxus ( = Amu-darya) and laxartes (= Sir-darya). Its most important town was Marakanda/Samarkand. About the Sogdians of the Achaemenid era Greek historians report interestingly, about their appearance the reliefs discussed above (2.3.) inform us graphically. Of their language nothing is known directly, but I have suggested recent ly06 that the river Oxus, ancient Vax§u, might represent *Bax§u, from *bag- ‘run, flow’ (cf.

evidence about Ancient Sogdian but not enough of course to see more clearly the characteristic features of this Eastern dialect in ancient times. 3.1. This unsatisfactory situation underwent a dramatic change in the early years of our century. Until then only the Sogdian names of the months, recorded by the Arab polyhistor Al Blrunl (ca. 1000 A. D.), had been known. But the flood of documents pouring in from Central Asia revealed a number of Middle Iranian dialects, and Andreas was able to state as early as 1904 that among the manuscript fragments found in Turfan there was a large number written, not in a „PehleviDialekt“ as it had been named by F. W. K. Muller, but in (Middle) Sogdian08. And a few years later, in 1908, Andreas was able to pinpoint two dialect features characteristic of Sogdian(6*r> &>/)°9, and two years later yet another, i. e. the development of d to I in part of the Sogdian area . The latter is of especial interest for our problem inasmuch as Andreas shows that the change occurred in the adjective Sulik ‘Sogdian’ from *SuyMk as well, a form which is recorded not only in Western Iranian sources but, as Su-li, also in the report of the Chinese pilgrim Huan-Tsang who passed through Sogdiana in 630 A. D. We now know that Chinese sources guarantee the development to Sult as early as 400 A. D. . But earlier attempts to find this name in

66 Cf. H. REICHELT, Die soghdischen Handschriftenreste des Britischen Museums II, Heidelberg 1931, p. 54. 67 These and similar adverbial forms in -au are found not only in Sogdian but also in Khotanese, Khwarazmian, and Ossetic, see GERSHEVITCH, o.c., p. 249 ad § 1076. Nevertheless, they cannot be claimed to contain an “Eastern Iranian 'language suffix’ -au-”, since they are now also attested in Parthian, and that in a more original form, as a prepositional phrase; cf. wymw 'wd frwmw 'in Greek and Latin’, see SUNDERMANN, MIO 14 (1968), p.40O. It is therefore not certain that the formation is based on a derivative in -dwan-, that is the nominative -dwd, with loss of the -d after a “heavy” stem, cf. GERSHEVITCH, o.c., §§ 1076 and 484. Semantically, it would be more satisfac tory to regard the type as an early coalescence (“Univerbierung”) of, e.g., *suybiyd wad 'Sogdian speech’, cf. for wad 'word, speech; spirit’, GERSHE VITCH, o.c., § 958. The coexistence of this nominatival type with the inflected type exhibited by zntw'bh 'mry 'singing bird’ would be paralleled by Pers. farrux 'fortunate’ from *farnahvd as against faxxunda from *farnahvant-. The doublets *parndu 'old woman’ and *parnus 'old, senile’ (see SZEMERENYI, Studies in the Kinship Terminology of the IE languages, Liege 1978, p. 58) are perhaps to be explained differently: ‘old woman’ points to *parndywi (fem. of parndyus) which, with ay to d, gave *parnaw, and parnus may be conflated from *parnayus and *watusa~, i.e. from *parn(dl)usa~.
3.2. Even more important is the fact that in the Sogdian docu ments the following formations have turned up6°: (1) swybyk 'Sogdian’ from *suybiyaka--,
(2) swybyEnw ‘Sogdians’ (in Ancient Letter II 9) from ^suybiyakandm;
6667
(3) Manich. (s)wyby'w, swytfyw 'in Sogdian, Sogdice', from *suybiyaw- ;
(4) sywbyk 'Sogdian’, from *syubiyaka- with metathesis from *suybiyaka-;



SOGDIAN(A) 29
(5) sywbyw (z[?k)QS 'Sogdian (language)’; (6) sywbyrik (np"yk) 'Sogdian (writings, literature)’ from ^syubiya7iaka~.
Of particular interest is that in the Ancient Letters (early fourth century A. D. ? or end of second century A. D. ?69) the only form found is swybyk-, while in later documents the metathetic form sywb- is the norm. One can even say, with Henning'0, that the standard spelling is sywbyk-. Thus in the only body of documents from Sogdiana itself, i. e. in the documents found on Mount Muy at Khairabad, north of Dusanbe, the capital of Tadjikistan, and some 120kms east of Samarkand, the ruler of Sogdiana, Dewastic (first half of the 8th century A. D.), is addressed or describes himself as follows71: (a) MN sywbyk MLK’ byw’styt12

[fn. 64], p.9. 71 HENNING, I. c., referred to Freiman’s paper in the Sogdijskij Sbornik (Leningrad 1934).

it appears twice more, again in the same document70; for the antece dent of this form cf. no. (6) above.
75 See A 14, 1—2 and 32—33 (II 78). 76 The form was given by Freiman in 1934 (see now I 23) as sywbyk in what looks as the second part (from 'nwth on) of formula (c). But the compilers of the glossary in II (p. 211) give swySk, although, if I am not mistaken, they do not reprint the one-line fragment. 77 This information is based on BARTHOLOMAE, AiWb., p. 1582, but see the text further on. 78 See J. DUCHESNE-GUILLEMIN, Les composes de I’Avesta, Liege 1936, p.151.
In the face of this consistent spelling sywb- it is unexpected, to say the least, that once even swySk should appear in this eighth-century corpus7765.77But if it is real, it signals the tenacious survival of an old form encountered under nos. 1—3 above, and kept alive by Kasyan also (see 3.1. above). 3.3. These facts suggest that the name of the Sogdians originally was suyba-, which later was metathetized to syuba-. And this sequence is borne out by the forms known from Old Iranian. Pride of place goes of course to the Achaemenid inscriptions which are firmly anchored in time. They present three variant spellings: (1) sa-u-gu-u-da = Suguda (2) sa-u-gu-da = Suguda (3) sa-u~ga-da = Sugda
All three appear already in Darius’ time, cf. Suguda in DB 1, 16; DNa 23; DSf 38; Sugllda in DPe 16 ;
Sugda in DPh 6; DH 5; XPh 21. It is interesting that the "short’ form invariably appears in the Elamite and Akkadian versions (Su-ug-da and su-ug-du respectively), and in Greek EoySoc, SoySiavr}. And the same short variant is the only form known to the other branch of Old Iranian. In Avestan literature we find (1) suybd • Sayana- "die Wohnung der Sogdianer bildend, wo die S. wohnen’, qualifying Gava in Vidcvdat 1.4.;
(2) suxbam (interpolated?) in the MiOra-yast (stz. 14), to be read
. q 77
as suybam <
No. (1) presents no special difficulties, it is in all likelihood simply a tatpurusa-compound, used as an adjective or in apposition78. But no. (2) is not as clear, it would seem, either formally (xb ?) or contextually.

but is it really credible that a clear gen. pl. sugdandm should have been lost and that the name of Khwarezm, always with an initial xv-, should (by "dilatation’?) have become ?83 Unfortunately, the latest interpretation does not seem to have brought a final solution either : the assumption that we have here groups of two names each, consisting “of a name of a region followed by an ethnical adjective”84, is based on nothing, and contradicts all our information on provincial lists. 3.4. In spite of these textual difficulties it is indisputable that both Old Persian and Avestan know the name of the area in question as Sugda, and that Old Persian offers a variant Suguda,

It has been argued recently that the relation of the two OP forms should be seen in the light of the epigraphic evidence80. In other words, since the Bisutun-inscription and many other inscriptions of Darius present Suguda, and Sugda appears only in DPh 6, DH 5, and in Xerxes’ daiva-inscription (XPh 21), we should conclude that Suguda is the earlier form, confined to the last two decades of the sixth century, while Sugda is to be dated later. But the rashness of this conclusion is shown by the fact, mentioned already (see 3.3. above), that both the Elamite and the Akkadian version only have the form Sugda. For it is now established beyond any doubt that the Elamite version of the Bisutun inscription was the first to be carved into the rock surface8865. And this evidence is supported by the Greek form.
85 Cf. HARMATTA, The origin of the name N6y3ol, Acta Classica Universitatis Debreceniensis 13 (1977), pp. 3—6; an almost unchanged reprint of this appears in HARMATTA (ed.), o.c. [fn. 17], 1979, pp. 153—156. 86 See CAMERON, o. c. [fn. 28], 1973, p. 51 ; and the references to TrOMPELMANN and WlESEHbFER [fn. 12]. 87 Cf. BARTHOLOMAE, Grundriss 1/1, Strassburg 1896, p. 176; MEILLET, MSL 17 (1912), pp.369f.; KENT, OP, p.45; K1SCH, Asiatische Studien 8 (1954), pp. 149f. 88 But see fn. 109 below. 89 ABAJEV, Osetinskijgazyk ifokkhr, I, Moscow—Leningrad 1949, pp. 211 and 183.
There can be no doubt that the form first received, that is the Sogdian form, was Sugda, its change to Suguda was an adaptation to Persian speech habits carried out in the Persis, at the royal court. The anaptyxis involved, the resolution of the ‘outlandish’ cluster ugd (or see below) to llgud, is known from the sequence duru- also which arose by anaptyxis from dru-, and was noted in our case very early8'. The coexistence of the two forms in the Bisutun-inscription and elsewhere is obiously due to sociolinguistic reasons, that is represents upper- and lower-class variants, which later were normalized in favour of the Sogdian pronunciation. 3.5. Having established that the Old Sogdian form was Suyba-, taken over into Old Persian as Sugda and, with anaptyxis, Suguda, we may now turn to the question of origin. As far as I can see, and although it might seem to verge on the incredible, the first attempt to interpret the name88 was made by the veteran Ossetic specialist V. I. Abajev in 1949. In his study on the Scythian language Abajev suggested89 that the name of Sogd(iana), contained in SouySata, name of a settlement in the Crimea [founded in



SOGDIAN(A) 33
212 A. D.!], showed a very precocious voicing of k and t, inasmuch as it derived from *sukta~, surviving as suyd- in Ossetic (Digor) sugdaeg "clean, holy’, whereas voicing normally occurred much later, in the second — third centuries A. D. This suggestion was repeated in 1972, and is now also recorded in the latest volume (1979) of Abajev’s magnum opus9Q. This most detailed version specifies that the voicing occurred in the early group xt>yd, not in the single voiceless stops, and that the name obviously meant ‘clean, hallowed’, with reference to country or town. (2) Exactly the same interpretation, but without mention of Abajev’s name, has recently been advanced by Harmatta . The only point worth noticing is that he is well aware that the (Middle) Sogdian form of the name, swyb~, is at variance with the Sogdian form of the PPP *suxta~, i. e. swyt, but, he opines (p. 5): “It would, however, be overhasty to conclude that the phonemic forms of the two words were different or that they can be traced back to different Proto-Iranian antecedents” ...; “the spelling swyb- can be regarded as phonetic and swyt~ as etymological”; he also thinks that, since t often alternates with 8 in Sogdian orthography, this t marked 8 in swyt- also. “There fore, it cannot be doubted that” Suyba derives from *suxta- ‘burnt’, and Sogd. ^wswyt ‘pure’, Osset, sugdceg ‘saint’ suggest a semantic filiation burnt ~^pure~> saint in the North Iranian languages, “rooted in the Pre-Zoroastrian fire cult of the North Iranians”. As to the meaning, which “may strike us as curious at first”, he refers the reader to Holy Land and SouySaia in the Crimea.

(3) An altogether different, and less self-assured, attempt was made by W. Eilers a few years ago when he tried to fit the name Sugda into the broader framework of country names based on river names (cf. Senegal, Kongo, Colorado, Illinois, Mississipi, Missouri, etc.) : “Wir mochten meinen, daB vielleicht auch die Sogdiane auf solch einen ursprunglichen FluBnamen zuruckgeht. In ap.

3.6. Of the several attempts reviewed the last one seems the least helpful. It presupposes the primacy of the trisyllabic form Suguda, and, what is more, it is forced to see in this a purely Indian (or archaic Aryan) formation, an assumption for which in this Iranian heartland there is not even a shred of evidence. And even if we are willing to ignore the difference in vowel-grade (guda: goda), we cannot ignore the fact that both Goda, allegedly another name of the river in the Deccan known as Godavari^, and Suguda are unattested in India, and the latter, if real, a compositional oddity presenting three members . And is "cow-giving’ an apt name of rivers ?
96
But the explanation from the PPP suxta- of saulc- "burn’ is also untenable, and that for several reasons. (a) The assumption that an early cluster xt could become yd in Sogdian as early as (the middle of?) the sixth century B. C., is not supported by a single piece of evidence. In fact, the admission (by Abajev) that the voicing of intervocalic (!) voiceless stops is not earlier than the second and/or third centuries A.D., rules out, even for isolated cases, its occurrence seven or eight centuries before. The name SouySaia is useless as evidence since the town was founded in 212 A. D., and the alleged example of an early change k>g, i. e. Herodotus’ MaatjayETox, explained by Abajev from *manu-sdka-ta, cannot outweigh Darius’ Saka. I would also add here that if, as I tried to show, the preconsonantal stops developed into the homorganic spirants under Semitic, more precisely Aramaic, influence, then it must be noted that the change of Proto-Iranian *sukta- to *suxta- was carried out around and after 600 B.C.97, and in Sogdian even with some delay so that there would not be enough time before 520 B.C. for a further change to suydar-.

(6) The equation of Sug(u)da with the PPP suxta- is, however, not only on chronological grounds erroneous, it is also demonstrably false in terms of the Sogdian phonological system. For it implies phonetic and/or phonological assumptions wThich are untenable. (1) It is alleged that (Middle) Sogdian swyb- 'Sogdian(a)’ and swyt 'burnt’ do not represent different phonetic and phonological forms. This is proved in the following manner98:91900
98 See Harmatta, o.c. [fn.85], 1979, p. 155. 99 Gershevitch, o.c. [fn.64], § 56. 100 See Harmatta, o.c. [fn. 85], 1979, p. 156.
Tn general a continuation d of the -t- in the past participle is presumed. In the spelling of many words, however, the -t- alternates with -3-. This phenomenon points to the fact that it marked -3- in reality”. But this argument is simply an egregious misreading of what Gershevitch clearly stated in the following terms (o.c. [fn. 64], § 268): “Instead of, or alternating with, t from Olr. t, some words have Manichaean 3, Christian d, in postvocalic position or after r. This presumably indicates a pronunciation d, cf. d from t in Khwarezmian and Ossetic”. In other words, the alternation of t/3 is found, not “in the spelling of many words”, but only in some, and, what is much more relevant, it is found only in postvocalic position or after r, and not after consonants in general as would be required for H’s argument. Moreover, Gershevitch’s 3 is not the spirant, as postulated by H., but the stop d as Gershevitch states in so many words. To clinch this point, it will be enough to stress that the Sogdian scribes were never in any doubt as to how the respective words had to be spelt : the ethnic is always spelt swyb- or sywb-, with 3, while the PPP is written swyt-, 'wswyt, and even, with analogical x", ’wswxt, but always with t. If the two forms had denoted the same entity, it would have been a miracle if the scribes could always have kept a straight line between the two possibilities of writing. (2) The particular argument concerning swyb is buttressed with some general considerations. “It would be overhasty to conclude that the phonemic forms of the two words were different” [see 3.5. (2) above] ; “In Sogdian d could exist at the most as an allophone (e.g. in the sound group -nd-) and in certain cases it could eventually alternate with 3. This was the case possibly also in the cluster -y3-~-yd-” 10°.

But this argument ignores the basic structure of the Sogdian phonological system which, for obvious reasons, was not presented in Gershevitch’s admirable work101 but is now, lege artis, established by B. Gharib102.
101 Nor, rather more surprisingly, in M. Dresden’s survey of Middle Iranian (in: Current Trends in Linguistics, ed. T. A. SEBEOK, vol. 6, The Hague 1970, pp. 26—63), although in the conspectus (pp.52f.) it is clearly stated that d indicates [d] and [3], and t, [t] and [d].

The relevant part of the consonantal system of Sogdian, that is the obstruents, show the following structure (p.45):
pt c k
[b d j g ] f Oss x (3 8 z z y
The fricatives 3 3 y reflect OIran. b d g “which have become spirants in all positions, except after nasal and a voiced sibilant” (p.53). The voiced stops b d j g “are predictable... They behave as allophonic variants, sometimes of voiceless stops, sometimes of voiced spirants” (p. 56). This means that, in the Middle Sogdian obstruent system, the voiced stops are not phonemic ; only the voiceless stops and the voiced and voiceless spirants are phonemic. But the voiceless stop phonemes include as allophones voiced stop phones, and these can be allophones of voiced spirant phonemes as well. This is, of course, the well-known problem of (the infringement of) the biuniqueness principle, exemplified by German [rat] as the singular of Rate and Rader, or [bunt] as the singular of bunte and Bunde, or [rayDor] in some American dialects, representing both writer and nder103. This kind of phonemic overlapping is illustrated by the Sogdian phone d. which can be the allophone of /t/ or /d/, but this does not mean



SOGDIAN(A) 37
that the phoneme /t/ can alternate with, that is to say have as its allophone, 8. The PPP swyt is phonetically [suyd] with a final phoneme /t/104, while swyb is phonetically [suyd] with a final phoneme /d/. No Sogdian could mistake either for the other.
104 In point of fact Gharib’s definition stating that p t k remain “except after nasal and voiced sibilant” (p. 56) must be modified. In the light of the facts given by GERSHEVITCH, o. c. [fn. 64], §§ 268f., it is clear that p t k were voiced intervocally (kadam ‘which’ from katdma-) and after voiced spirants (avd ‘seven’ from hafta, suyd ‘burnt’ from suxta) as well. The latter question is well discussed by Gharib, pp. 86f. 105 The pace of the development was faster in India (cf. Vedic §uti‘ clean’; Sukra-, Sukla- ‘light, bright, pure’) but this does not affect the Iranian issue. 106 See CAMERON, o. c. [fn. 28], p. 47, and o. c. [fn. 13], p. 84 fn. 23.
(c) In addition to these phonetic / phonological points, there are also semantic obstacles in the way of the proposed derivation. (1) It is assumed, without further ado, that the semantic trajec tory starting from burnt reached, via clean, the final point holy by the mid-sixth century B.C. at the latest! And yet the facts clearly show that Old Iranian everywhere had the original meaning burning I burnt only; cf. also suxra- ‘red’ (of fire). The stage purify and adj. clean was reached in Middle Iranian times, cf. Khotanese suraa- ‘clean’, va-suj‘purify’ (from ava-sau6~); Sogdian psw6- ‘purify’, ’wswyt ‘pure’. And the stage holy seems to be only found in Modern Ossetic sugckeg ‘clean, holy’, for the town-name EouySaca is surely simply ‘Sogdian’105. (2) It is further assumed that ‘holy’ was applied to a town or land — again without any attempt to prove this assumption. And yet, Cameron issued a warning several years ago which ought to be heeded: “I am no longer convinced that they [: the lists] are lists of provinces or administrative satrapies ...; the Great Kings ... are enumerating not lands, but various groups of people whom they thought worthy of specific mention”106. This is particularly clear in the throne-bearer labels of A?P (see 1.3.2. (6) above) and in the cartouches of the new Suez inscription (see 1.3.3. (9) above). In A?P the following throne-bearers are named by derivative ethnics for the first time: Uvdrazmiya, Kusdya, Gandaraya, Oataguiya, Putdya, Ma6iya, Harauvatiya, Hinduya, i. e. nine out of thirty. In eleven cases the ethnic was used as the name of the province from the start, cf. Pdrsa, Mada, O(v}ja, ParOava, Saka, Arabaya, Mudraya, Katpatuka, Yauna, Skudra, Karka. The Assyrian throne

bearer is named AVuriya, i. e. by a derivative from the province name AOura, as he is already in Darius’ inscriptions. In fact, of the twentysix names preserved in A?P, twenty-five are adjectival ethnics! Sug(u)da does not appear in the extant labels of A?P but it is quite clear from the Greek SoySot that it was used as an ethnic, not as the name of a country. This is corroborated by Avestan Gavam yam Suyda-Sayanam "Gava, the settlement of the Sogdians’. And it needs no lenghty demonstration that the inhabitants, erring humans, could not be labelled saints. 3 .7. The sum total of these positive and negative considerations irresistibly leads to a new solution. Since, as we have seen, the (Middle) Sogdian form was a phonetic Suyb-, we must ask whether this enables us to make a definite statement about the sound shape of this name in Old Sogdian, more precisely in early Achaemenid times when the Old Persian inscriptions present the forms Suguda, Sugda. 3.7.1. We can, first of all, make an extremely important statement about the cluster gd. Purely theoretically, we could assume that gd represents original g-d, that is a root ending in g or k and a suffix d, IE d or dh. But, on inspection, we find that an Aryan suffix -d(li}a- is extremely rare107.
107 See WACKERNAGEL—DEBRUNNER, Ai.Gr. II 2, pp.723, 725; and MAYRH0FER, Et.Wb., s.vv. 108 SZEMERENYI, Kinship [fn. 67], pp.20f.
One of the best attested instances is Avest. mvz-da~ "meed, reward’: Ind. mzdha-, Gk. gicrOo^ IE ^miz-dho-. More doubtful cases are Avest. myazda- "offering of food’: Ind. miyedha- "sacrificial oblation’; Aryan *m(i)yaz-dha~ 1
Ind. meda- "fat, marrow’: Iran. *mazda- "food’ (?). But not only are these types rare, they also seem to represent formations with IE *dhe- "set, put’ and ‘give’, which are unsuited for Sugda-. And the same applies to the root-part sug- whether that be original *sug- or assimilated *suk~. The difficulties would be just as great if we tried to trace Sugda- to a theoretically also possible Aryan *sugh-ta- which by Bartholomae’s law would have become *sugdha-, Iranian * sugda-. But there is no Aryan root *swgh-, and, if there had been one, the result, in Iranian, would have been phonetic sugda-, cf. Sogdian bwyt, Avest. dugddarfrom *dugh-tar- (by metathesis from *dhug-tar-108).



SOGDIAN(A) 39
But the basic fault with all these explanations is the fact that they all operate with a stop cluster -gd- whereas we have found that the Sogdian form had the spirant cluster -yd-. 3.7.2/ If, then, we have to start from an Old Sogdian Suyda-, then it becomes clear at once that such a form, with two spirants, presuppo ses an earlier form, in which the second spirant at least was between vowels so that it was spirantized in early times, see 3.6. (b) (2) and 1.4.2. above. This still admits of two possibilities concerning the first obstruent in the cluster. One is that it represents an original g which became y so that the original form was *Suguda~, and this became *Suyuda- and was then syncopated to *Suyda-. The other is that the first obstruent started life as k, and the original *Sukuda- developed into *Sukuda~, and by syncope into *Sukda-, in which the preconsonantal k had to become the spirant x, and eventually the voiced y, the resulting form being *Suyda-.
It is clear that *Suguda is not amenable to an appropriate interpretation in Iranian. On the other hand, *Sukuda offers just as clearly the right solution-, it is nothing else but the anaptyctic form of the Pontic Skuda{^. By a curious interplay of dialectal idiosyncracies, the anaptyctic *Sukuda was in Sogdian again syncopated to Suyda, whereas in Old Persian this form was taken over (with stops) as Sugda, and then given, at least for a short time, an anaptyctic variant Sugitda'10.
3 .8. These results are of great interest, not only to the linguist, but also to the historian. For they show that at first all the North Iranian tribes of the steppe region, from Central Asia to the Pontic region, had one common name, i. e. Skuda- ‘archer’. More precisely, this was, to begin with, the name of the North Iranian nomadic tribes between the Caspian and, say, Lake Balkhash until early in the first millennium B.C. the forces adumbrated at the beginning of our discussions drove these tribes in ever increasing numbers on a west ward trek. This expansion led to a linguistic differentiation. In the Pontic region the name Skuda developed by the mid-first millennium B. C. to
109 This solution was outlined in a brief footnote in 1947, see SZEMERE NYI, o.c. [fn. 35], p. 117, but omitted in the English version of 1951. 110 In the light of these findings the parallelism between the Sogdian and Old Persian developments, stressed by HENNING, BSOS 9 (1938), p. 549, has to be slightly modified.

Skula. In the East, at least between the Oxus and laxartes, the same name developed into Suyba. The Achaemenids adopted this name in the form Sug(u)da but restricted its use to a well-defined geographical area of their realm. Nomads of the same general linguistic and cultural type beyond the Sogdians were designated as Saka. And when, in the course of their westward drive to and into Anatolia, the Achaemenids reached and then crossed the Bosporus and moving north met tribes of much the same linguistic and cultural habits as the Sakas known to them in the East, they called them also Sakas. This nomenclature was, not surprisingly, adopted by the Elamite scribes of the court (:§d-akqa), but the Akkadian interpreters, harking back to bygone ages, retained or revived the old name Gi-mi(r)~ri, that is the name of the invaders from the North who preceded the Scythians proper on the Northern outskirts of the Assyrian realm. The Greeks, on the other hand, viewed the steppe world from their own end: for them all steppe nomads were Scythians since they were the first specimens of these curious beings whom they had met. This broad use of one and the same ethnic for a large area is paralleled in earlier times, roughly in the mid-second millennium B. 0., by the rapid spread to all Indo-Iranian tribes (and no others!) of the new name arya ‘Aryan’111.
111 See SZEMERENYI, Kinship [fn. 67], pp. 125—149. 112 H. SKOLD, Bulletin de la Societe des Lettres, Lund, 1931—2, pp. 1—5. His view was taken up and defended by VAN WlNDEKENS, BzN 1 (1949), pp. 98f. Cf. also W. BRANDENSTEIN, Gedenkschrift P. Kretschmer, I, Wiesba den—Wien 1956, p. 58.
4. But this broad use of the term Saka prompts the question whether its meaning can be discovered. Attempts to answer this question have not been wanting. 4.1. One of the earliest seems to have been the interpretation of the name as ‘dog’. It was advanced by H. Skold who thought that Ispakai of the A&guzai people, mentioned during Esarhaddon’s reign (681—669 B.C., see 1.1.2. above), was not a prince but a people, Ispakai representing the oldest form of the name of the Saka, i. e. *Spaka. In the period between Esarhaddon and Darius I in the Khotanese language sp developed into ss, and so the name became Saka (as in Sanskrit), and was received into Old Persian, with sound substitution, as Saka.
112



SOGDIAN(A) 41
But, unfortunately, the Khotanese form of ‘dog’ was not *spaka but svdn- or ssuvan-^^. And, in any case, if IE kw had developed into sp, this could never have gone to Ss but would have been preserved as sp, so that phonetically the explanation is unacceptable. Moreover, Akkadologists unanimously take Ispakai to be the name of a prince, and not of a people, another serious obstacle. 4.2. Another animal, this time the deer, was found in the name of the Saka by Abajev in 19491,4. He compared Saka (misprinted as saka ‘Scythian’) with Ossetic sag ‘hart’ from *sdka-, connected with the large group of IE words meaning ‘branch’ (Ind. Sakha, Lithu. Saka), ‘plough’ (Russ, soxa, Goth, hoha), ‘fork’ (Lithu. Sake). But the deriva tion presupposes a vrddhi-formation from *sak- ‘fork’ (cf. NPers. Sax ‘branch; antlers’!), so that *sdka- would be ‘provided with antlers, deer’, whereas Saka-, with its normal-grade vocalism, could not have had this meaning. 4.3. In the meantime, a quite different suggestion had been put forward by A. Christensen1 lo. Discussing Ahura Mazda’s statement in the Videvdat (1.4.) that he created as the second-best country in the world Gava, home of the Sogdians, while Ahra Manyu, the destructive, created as a scourge of the land, sakaiti, the very destructive (sakaitim yqm ... pouru. mahrkom), Christensen first argued that the reading skaitim, adopted by Geldner and Bartholomae, was unacceptable because the metre required sakaitim: ahya patyaram frakrntat ahrb manyus purumarko sakatim yam purumarkam.
Then, rejecting the traditional interpretation of skaiti as ‘locust’, he suggested that Sakaiti was ‘le peuple des Saces’, so that the passage quoted was to be translated as: “Comme opposition Ahra Manyu le tres destructeur y a produit le peuple tres destructeur des Saces” (p. 77). This surprising combination of Saka with Sakaiti was justified by reference to Hard-Haraiti'. “Hard est le nom d’une montagne et Harati*
113 Bailey, BSOAS 13 (1951), p.933, thought that Khotanese svdnrepresented a blend of suv- and sv-; cf. now BAILEY, Dictionary of Khotan Saka, Cambridge 1979, p.405. 114 See Abajev, o.c. [fn.89], p.179; Abajev, o.c. [fn.90], III, pp.!2f.; 14f. 115 See Christensen, o.c. [fn.82], pp. I lf., 65.

la denomination du massif dont Hara est le point le plus saillant” (p.65). But the reference to Hara-Haraitl does not throw light on the relation of Saka and Sakaiti, on the contrary. However, in the case of Hara-Haraitl there is a chance of glimpsing the nature of their relation. For Haraiti surely is reminiscent of the type seen in barvzaiti, i. e. suggests a formative -nti. And, beside this feminine formation, a masculine in -a, from IE -on, would be expected, represented not only by Greek cpspcov, but also by OP tunuva, and perhaps also by the Slavic participles in -y, e.g. OCS vedy ‘leading’1 lb. And this analysis is •completed by Bailey’s discovery that hard is formed on a root har- ‘to rise’, seen in Ossetic xcerd ‘ascent’, Sogdian (Buddh.) yr-, (Christ.) xr‘go’, etc. But this root is not to be identified with IE *ser- ‘flow’ in Ind. sarati, sisarti, etc. — a semantically impossible combination111176— but with a root found in the Anatolian group, i. e.
116 Cf. SZEMERENYI, Einfuhrung, Darmstadt 21980, pp. 109, 152, 292, where it is shown that in most languages the old masculine -o(n) was replaced by the clear ending -on(t)s. 117 See BAILEY, Dictionary [fn. 113], pp.467, and especially 479f. Differently GERSHEVITCH, JNES 23 (1964), p. 37 (: har- ‘watch’) ; TruBACev, Etimologija (1977), 1979, pp. 130f. (: Hard from *sald ‘flowing’). 1,8 Cf. GUSMANI, AION-L 4 (1962), pp.45f.; IlEUBECK, Orbis 13 (1964), pp.264—267 (adds Gk. p£ov from *sriyom, and? at'pco from *sr-yoy, Cop, IF 75 (1971), p. 86.
Hitt, ser ‘aloft’, sard [sra] ‘up’ Luw. sarri [sri] ‘aloft’, sarra [sra] ‘up’ Lycian hri ‘above’ from Phrygian opou ‘above’ from *sor-o118. This means that an IE verbal root *ser- ‘to rise’ gave Iranian hard and harati ‘rising, elevation, mount(ain)’, the first no doubt in concord with gari- m. ‘hili’, the second perhaps after a feminine *brz- ‘high, height, hili’, identical with OIrish bri, gen. breg, and Germanic burg-, variant of (German) Berg. But the masc. hard was naturally attracted into the -aclass, and became a feminine, more or less a variant of harati, cf. Av. harayd bdrdzo and haraibya bxrdzo.
But if, thus, we have succeeded in clarifying the relation of Hard to Haraiti, our results have contributed nothing to our understanding of the interrelation of Saka and Sakati. In fact, the implausibility of a people being named as the plague of Gava in the Videvdat-passage counsels against adopting this view. Much to be preferred is the



Sogdian(a) 43
suggestion that skaiti (sic) survives in Buddh. Sogdian 'skt ‘thorn’, Christ. Sogd. sqf1 ‘tares’, Parthian cskd ‘thorns’119, which, I have suggested120, is a Semitic loan-word in Iranian.

[fn.33], p.56. 122 Bailey, Languages of the Saka (Handbuch der Orientalistik I/IV/I, Leiden 1958, pp. 131 -154), p. 133. 123 Cf, e.g., F. SOLMSEN—E. FRAENKEL, Indogermanische Eigennamen, Heidelberg 1922, pp.95f. — A case in point is the name of the Doha, in Achaemenid times mentioned only once in Xerxes’ daiva-inscription (XPh 26), and, as long recognized (see, after Hillebrandt, KONOW, Fs. Thomsen, 1912, p. 97, and now Bailey, Dictionary, p. 155), identical with Khot. daha- ‘man, male’, and connected with OP, Av. dahyu- ‘land’, Ind. dasyu- ‘(hostile) people’, dasa- ‘enemy, slave’ (and Gk. SooXo;, Mycenaean do-e-ro from *dos-elos'l). Since the Dacians in Transylvania and Oltenia are thought to be of Thracian origin but massively overlaid by Iranian elements during a Scythian period in the 7th—4th centuries B.C. (see J.FlTZ, in: Der Kleine Pauly, vol. 1, 1979, pp. 1355f.; BENGTSON, Grundriss der romischen Geschichte, I, Munich 1967, p. 329), it seems reasonable to assume that their name Daka- represents an earlier *Dahaka~, which, apart from the transposition of quantity, is identical with Av. azi- dahaka-, see Bailey, TPS 1959, p. 111 ; BENVENISTE, Mel. Renou, 1968, p. 77, and, on some further problems, BELARDT, The Pahlavi Book of the Righteous Viraz, I, Borne 1979, pp.23f; M. SCHWARTZ, Orientalia 49, 1980, p. 123f. — As is known, the simplex Doha- (identical with Iranian Doha) is also preserved in the form Aaoc, Dduos; the alternative explanation from an alleged *dhawos, *dhakos ‘wolf (cf. A. VRACIU, Limba Daco-Getnlor, Timisoara 1980, pp. 25, 175) is phonetically untenable since intervocalic w would have been kept, cf. the place-name element -daua.
4.4. An interpretation based on the verbal root of Ind. §ak-nAmi ‘I can, am able to’ was first advocated by Markwart in 1930 (: “eine ehrenvolle Bezeichnung”!), and has in recent years won the whole hearted support of Sir Harold Bailey . But the argument advanced is most perplexing: “since ‘men’ as a tribal name is well attested..., a likely conjecture is that saka- is the adjective from sak- ‘be powerful, skilful’ (attested in the Rigvedic su-sdka-) used as an epithet of ‘men’.” Perplexing because it is a pure non sequitur. Even if it is conceded that ‘men’ is often used as a tribal name — as is certainly the case — it doesn’t follow that an epitheton used with it can just as naturally be used as a tribal name. What is more, it is only in Indian that sakshows the meaning ‘to be able, strong’. In Iranian, the corresponding

root sak- ‘sich verstehen auf, im Gedachtnis behalten; understand’, hsak- ‘memorize’, Khotanese sdj- ‘to learn’, Buddh. Sogd. 'fis'y't ‘to teach’ (from *fra-sataya-)l24,12e5tc., are so consistently centred on the semantic field of knowing, teaching that we must conclude that the Indian ‘be able, strong’ must be secondary, and with this the possibili ty of an Iranian saka- ‘powerful’ disappears.
124 For the Iranian material see GERSHEVITCH, o.c. [fn. 84], pp.257f.; D. WEBER, Die Stellung der sog. Inchoativa im Mitteliranischen, Diss. Gottin gen 1970, p. 147. 125 Gershevitch, o.c. [fn.84], p. 176. 126 Bailey, o.c. [fn. 122], p. 132. 127 R. N. Frye, The heritage of Persia, London 1962, p. 43. In spite of this clear pointer, Frye is content with Bailey’s ‘powerful’.
4.5. If, then, ‘dog’, ‘deer’, ‘powerful’, all seem equally unavailing, we are once again thrown back on the basic question: what was it that seemed, or still seems, characteristic of the Saka tribes? We know of course that certain tribes had special names, e.g. tigraxauda-, haumavarga-, but they were all called Saka, in fact, for the Achaemenids all peoples north of the settled areas were Saka. The answer is succinctly put by Gershevitch: “XvaniraOa is the ‘land of settled dwelling, etc.’, as opposed to the Northern Steppes where life was nomadic”120. Even more terse is Bailey’s statement: the Saka, known to Achaemenids and Greeks in the 6th century B. 0., “lived as nomads to the east beyond Suguda”126. More detailed is the picture limned by Frye : “In Central Asia, outside of the oases, lived nomads called generically ‘Saka’ by the Persians. It was probably their mode of life rather than any ethnic or linguistic features which differentiated them from their settled neighbours, the Sogdians, and Khwarezmians and others; ... one may suppose that the Sakas-Scythians were undifferentiated by the settled people of the Near East as later the various Turkic peoples were considered to be ‘Turks’”127. This picture naturally draws on the statements of the ancients. Strabo describes (XI, 8, 1) that travelling east we find Bactria and Sogdiane, and, last, the nomad Scythians ( = Sakas): eW’ BaxTpiavT) erm xal SoySiavY], teXeutouol 3e SxuOat. vogaSs;;. The Scythians east of the Caspian are all in their great majority nomads (XI, 8, 2): c<kdcvtec 8’ ox; ekI to tuoXu vogaSst;. But in accord with Darius (DPh 5—6), Strabo also specifically mentions the Saka who live beyond Sogdiana (XI, 11, 2): the laxartes separates the Sogdians and the nomads (oOto^ 3e xat too^ SoyStooc; opi^Ei xal tou<; vogaSac;).



SOGDIAN(A) 45
In view of these clear pointers, it would seem reasonable to assume that Saka is ‘nomad’. I first made this suggestion a good many years ago128 but the evidence has since increased tremendously. At that time I submitted that Saka was an adjective/agent noun derived from the Iranian root *sak- ‘go, flow, run’ found in the morphologically not very clear OP Oakatd, preserved in the date formulae as Parthian sxt and Sogdian syty\ in Lithu. §okti ‘jump’, and Ind. sakatam ‘wagon’; Saka therefore meant ‘running, swift’ or ‘vagrant, nomadic’.
128 See SZEMERENYI, o.c. [fn. 35], 1951, p.212. 129 See Gershevitch, o.c. [fn. 84], pp.257f., and cf. Weber, o.c. [fn. 124], pp. 149, 195. 130 On the question whether not only Lithu. §okti but also Slavic skokb ‘jump’, etc., belong with Iran. 2sak- which, in 1951, I answered in the negative, see now also STANG, o. c. [fn. 43], p. 86. 13'. LlTVINSKIJ’s paper on the name of the Saka, listed in Sprache 19 (1973), p. 232, no. 196, has remained inaccessible to me.
Today, our Iranian material is not confined to Bartholomae’s root 2sak- ‘(zeitlich) vonibergehen, verstreichen’, nor to this meaning alone. Thanks to Gershevitch’s perspicacity we now see that 2sak- is the basis of the following derivative groups129: (1) ‘pass’ in Pahl. sa6- ‘pass away’, Sanglechi §axs- ‘pass over’, Parth. *wsxt ‘descend’, and the group of OP ()akatd\ (2) ‘pass’ —/be suitable, fitting’ (cf. Germ, passen, Greek xaO'/jxEi, Kpocnjxa) in Parth. s6yd ‘it is fitting’ = MPe. szyd, NPers. sazad, Sogd. 8&t,
(3) Causative ‘make suitable, prepare; adorn, arrange’, cf. Parth. s’#-, p8^6~lp8xt~, nys’z- ‘prepare, arrange’, MPe. psz-/psxt-, hs’z-lhs’xt- ‘to prepare’, NPers. sdxtan ‘prepare, manufacture’; Sogd. pts^-lptsyt‘adorn, arrange’, pts’k ‘order, arrangement’, ‘to join, fix’; Arm. palSak ‘suitable’. We can sum up these findings by saying that Iran. 2sak~ originally meant ‘go, roam’, then developed the specialized senses ‘pass’ (of time), ‘behove’, ‘be fitting’, and, through the causative, ‘make fitting, prepare, arrange, produce’130. It seems obvious, then, that Saka is the ‘roamer, wanderer’, the ‘vagrant nomad’131. 5. Our results can thus be summed up as follows. (7) The name of the Scythians can with the help of the external and internal data (Greek LxvOvjt;, Assyrian a&kuz on the one hand, Scythian Skules, Skolotai on the other) be restored as Skuda. It was



46 O. SZEMERENYI
formed from the IE root *skeud- "propel, shoot’, well-known from the Germanic languages (Engl, shoot, etc.), so that Skuda had the meaning "shooter, archer’, in accord with the information handed down about this people. (2) The Skudra, a people named between the Greeks of Asia Minor and the mainland, and the Western Scythians, are usually identified with the Macedonians and/or Thracians. But the Achaemenidian thro ne-bearer reliefs reveal that their dress and armament was identical with that of Walser’s ""Sogdo-Scythian” group. They were, therefore, part of this ethnic group, that is also Iranians, and their name Skudra a derivative of Skuda, name of the Scythians. (3) The name of the Sogdians, OP Sug(u)da, has in recent years been explained as being identical with the Sogdian word swyt = [suyd], originally "burnt’, but in later times also "clean’ and "holy’, so that Sugda was the "Holy Land’. It can be shown, however, that this explanation is unacceptable on phonological and semantic grounds. On the other hand, the fact that the true name of the Sogdians, not of their country, was [suy8] demands an antecedent with a vowel between the consonants, that is *Suyuba or *Sukuba. There can be no doubt that the latter gives the correct solution, since it is nothing else but the anaptyctic form of the Pontic Skuda. This is of the greatest importance to the historian. For it reveals that at first all North Iranian tribes of the steppe region had one common indigenous name, i. e. Skuda "archer’. In the Pontus region the name developed by the middle of the first millennium into Skula, preserved in the Greeks’ SxuXt^, SxoXotoc!,. In Sogdian, on the other hand, it went to Suy(u)ba, taken over by the Achaemenids as Sugda. (4) Saka, used by the Achaemenids as a generic term for all Northern nomads (in lieu of the earlier Skuda), cannot have meant "dog, or "stag’, or "powerful’. In agreement with the general characteri zation of these peoples as nomads, their name can only be traced to the now well established root sak- "go, roam’, so that Saka meant the "wanderer’, "vagrant nomad’.
