Herbal Remedies Introduction
Herbal Remedies have been around for thousands of years.
In fact, many of the pharmaceutical medications we use today were originally created from natural ingredients.
Common drugs like opium (from poppies), aspirin (from willow bark), digitalis (from foxglove), and quinine (from the cinchona tree) have been used as cures for many diseases and disorders.
A 2004 government survey concluded that more than one third of adults use alternative herbal medicines.
This book will be an ongoing project providing you with the most in−depth collection of the use of Herbal Remedies today and in the past for use in curing common everyday ailments. More chapters will continue to be added.
Please remember there is no substitute for the advice from our own doctor. The contents of this book are not meant to replace the diagnosis of a medical professional.

Herbal Remedies Gardening
The best way to have fresh herbs is to grow them yourself.
Fresh herbs are now more available than ever. The best way to get fresh herbs is to grow your own in either a container garden or in a garden bed. Here are ways to plant, handle and use fresh
herbs from your herb gardens.
No longer is there a designated "herb garden". They can be found in your flower beds, along walkways or in pots on your porch. Many gardeners are finding new ways to incorporate herbs into their garden beds and their container gardens.
Many gardeners are unaware of the beauty of flowering herbs and never consider planting them within their flower beds.
Some herbs that have beautiful flowers are purple coneflower, catmint, bee balm, yarrow, pinks, lavender, pot marigold, borage, feverfew, and nasturtium which is particularly lovely in fresh salads.
Many other herbs, such as parsley are excellent next to flowers of all sorts because of their spectacular foliage. When planting red or blue flowers, place purple basil around them for an artful arrangement.
Another area to consider is to use herbs as ground cover. The herbs that are suitable to this are the low growing oregano, chamomile, woolly and other creeping thyme, mint, and rosemary.
Not only will it look pretty but it will be absolutely fragrant.
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide

One of the best ways I have grown herbs is in containers.
The beauty of a container garden is that it is portable and can be changed at a moment’s whim. When there is no more room in your garden, start a container garden which you can place on your door step or patio.
Use them to fill in bare spots that come up during the gardening season or put them on a sunny window sill in your home for easy harvesting. Best of all you can bring your herb containers inside over the winter months and continue to harvest for months to add to your tasty meals or to be used for medicinal purposes.
Another way to employ pots in your garden is to plant invasive herbs such as mint into a pot and then plant pot and all into the ground. This is an easy trick to keep those "creepers" from
taking over your garden beds.
Some herbs that have grown on rocky hillsides over the centuries such as thyme, oregano and lavender are perfect for cracks in flag stone paths or walls and rock gardens. They thrive in hot dry areas with good drainage. Some believe that those herbs grown in these conditions produce much better flavor.
Since all the herbs and plants mentioned in this ebook are annuals, biennials, perennials, or low shrubs, there is no need to match the speed of spring with hasty planting.
Herb Gardens are easily and successfully grown in a wide variety of garden planters and containers, as well as in the garden.
Herb gardeners can move most of the plants in their herb gardens, with a little care in watering, almost any time, and the seeds of annuals can be planted whenever there is a reasonable hope of maturity before autumn frosts.
This gives one time for selection of herbs, and where to plant them (garden planters, simple containers or in−ground).
You can then decide how many annuals, biennials, or perennials
you have room for in your herb garden.

10 Herbs That Heal
Red Raspberry
Ellagic Acid has been found to occur naturally in 46 different foods, with the red raspberry having been identified as having the highest natural content.
Ellagic acid is a phenolic compound found in plants in the form of hydrolyzable tannins called ellagitannins. Ellagitannins are esters of glucose with hexahydroxydiphenic acid; when hydrolyzed, they yield Ellagic acid, the dilactone of hexahydroxydiphenic acid. Ellagic acid is a very stable compound and is readily absorbed through the gastrointestinal system in mammals, including humans.
Research studies on Ellagic acid have been extensive, especially in vitro studies and studies in laboratory animals. Although yet to prove conclusively in humans that red raspberries will reduce risk of cancer or even cause remission of active disease, this research does represent a substantial body of evidence to support the protective effects of ellagitannins in humans in combination with other chemopreventive nutrients.
Berries are the most common food sources of Ellagic acid. The relative amount of Ellagic acid in average number of micrograms per gram of dry weight fruit extract is highest in red raspberries at 1500 mcg, followed by strawberries at 630 mcg,
walnuts at 590 mcg, pecans at 330 mcg, and cranberries at 120 mcg.
Ellagic acid promotes carcinogen detoxification by stimulating the activity of various isoforms of the enzyme glutathione−S− transferase in hepatoma (liver cancer).
Ellagic acid slows the growth of abnormal colon cells in humans, prevents the development of cells infected with the human papilloma virus (HPV) linked to cervical cancer, and triggers apoptosis (natural death) of prostate cancer cells. This apoptotic process may also have beneficial effects on breast, lung, esophageal, and skin cancer (melanoma).
Ellagic acid from raspberries causes apoptosis (normal cell

death) of human cervical cancer cells (human papilloma virus), induces G1 inhibition of cancer cell division, and prevents destruction of the P53 gene by cancer cells. P53 is regarded as a safeguard against mutagenic activity (cancer causing changes) in cervical cells (Nixon, Narayanan).
Unpublished research at the Hollings Cancer Center shows that one cup of raspberries per week will stop prostate cancer growth for a period of up to one week.
Their studies reveal that Ellagic acid from red raspberries is
readily absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract.
Ellagic acid retains its potency after heating, freezing and concentration processing. So whether consumed fresh, in juices, fruit spreads, preserves or sorbets, red raspberry has been
recommended as a beneficial part of any healthy diet.
Pomegranate
The lovely and delicious pomegranate fruit reminds us of the lush gardens of Andalucia, Spain. The name comes from Pomme de Granada, "apple of Granada" as it was thought to have originated there. In ancient times, pomegranate fruit was regarded as a symbol of fertility due to the round shape, and abundant seeds.
Recently however, science has discovered important compounds, which indicate its benefits, transcend ancient
symbolism.
Pomegranate extract is primarily composed of alkaloids and polyphenols. The active constituent that appears to be responsible for its multiple health benefits is Ellagic acid. Ellagic acid is a naturally occurring phenolic compound found in several fruits and nuts. Pomegranate extract has demonstrated a variety of beneficial functions including antioxidant and
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide
9



anti−viral activity.
In 1996, a Nottingham, PA University research team learned that pomegranate extract could destroy several viruses nearly on contact. The discovery of this anti−viral activity instigated further experimentation and clinical trials. One study confirmed that Ellagic acid effectively protects cells from damaging free radicals.
Additional phenolic compounds found in pomegranate known as anthocynadins (also well known scavengers of free radicals) combine synergistically with Ellagic acid to greatly augment pomegranate's potency as an antioxidant.
Of great importance is the pomegranate extracts potential use as a chemo−preventive agent. Initial experimentation by Stoner and Mukhtar showed that Ellagic acid decreased the number of chemically induced lung tumors by 44−75%. Mukhtar further illustrated that topical application of Ellagic acid provided
protection against chemically induced skin tumors.
Ellagic acid has several mechanisms of actions by which it exhibits its chemo−preventive properties. Research by Barch et al. Demonstrated that Ellagic acid could actually bind to DNA, thus preventing its carcinogenic alteration.
Additionally, Ellagic acid has been shown to induce the production of phase 11 detoxification enzymes through its manipulation of gene expression.
With an increased concentration of these enzymes, various tissues ability to detoxify harmful compounds is augmented.
Finally, Ellagic acid was found to be a potent inhibitor of tyrosine protein kinase, a molecule whose activity has been associated with the ability of certain viruses to transform
normal cells into cancerous cells.

Terminalia chebula
Terminalia chebula is an exciting new source of both Ellagic Acid and various tannins.
Used for centuries in Asia, extracts from this fruit have
hundreds of clinical studies showing its efficacy.
Name: HARAD
Botanical Name: Terminalia chebula
Local Names: Haritaki (Sanskrit and Bengali), Harad (Hindi), Karkchettu (Telugu), Kadukkaya (Tamil), Harade (Marathi) and Gujarati).
Various extracts have been prepared from the powdered fruits. It contains a constituent which has a wide anti− bacterial and antifungal spectrum, and also inhibits growth of E. coli, the most common organism responsible for urinary tract infection.
The plant is used extensively in the preparation of many ayurvedic (The ancient Hindu science of health and medicine) formulations for infectious diseases such as: chronic ulcers, leucorrhoea, pyorrhoea and fungal infections of the skin.
Triphala is an important formulation in the ayurvedic pharmacopoeia containing haritaki.
They are used to prevent aging and impart longevity, immunity
and body resistance against disease.
They have beneficial effects on all the tissues.
One study showed that Terminalia chebula significantly increased gastric emptying. The enhancement of gastric emptying was comparable to that produced by metoclopramide (a pharmaceutical drug). This indicates that Terminalia chebula can be an useful alternative

to the prokinetic drugs available today.
Garlic
Garlic has been a mainstay of Southern European cooking for centuries, but much of the world has an appreciation for the medicinal benefits of garlic. Millions of mothers know that
fresh cut garlic cloves produce healing results.
Egyptian slaves building the pyramids were provided rations of garlic, not only to improve the quality of their daily rations, but also to keep them free of disease.
According to a new study from the National Cancer Institute, garlic and similar vegetables may be the reason Chinese men have so little prostate cancer, and the latest research developments indicate garlic's primary active ingredient, (allicin) may become a major player on the health scene.
Fresh−crushed garlic cloves are far more powerful, and beneficial, than any commercial garlic product tested. This is proven by the consistent failure of garlic supplements in clinical and university studies.
On the other hand, fresh−crushed garlic releases an enzyme called allinase with allian to produce allicin, the primary active ingredient in garlic.
For the first time, garlic's active component has been captured, stabilized, and through a patented process, can be delivered directly to where your body needs it.
This sophisticated refinement process takes the finest raw garlic bulbs and formulates allicin liquid which is carefully
spray−dried to produce pure allicin powder.
Now you can receive all the wonderful benefits of garlic without the negative side effects of odor and taste.
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide
12



200 mg of pure allicin (the amount contained in one, 2−capsule serving of Total Immune Booster) contains the equivalent benefits of 30−50 fresh garlic bulbs.
Years of research conducted at The Garlic Centre of Battle, East Sussex, United Kingdom, the world's leading garlic research center, have proven the pharmacological activities of allicin in many areas, including:
* Anticoagulation − thins the blood * Antihypertensive − reduces blood pressure * Antimicrobial − kills microscopic organisms * Antibiotic − kills poisonous bacteria * Antiparasitic − kills parasites * Antimycotic − kills fungal infections * Antiviral − kills viruses * Anti−tumor − reduces or prevents malignant tumors * Antioxidant − scavenges and removes dangerous free radicals * Anti−aging − delays aging * Anti−platelet − reduces blood platelet "clumping" * Detoxifies heavy metals − removes lead, mercury and other toxic material * Fibrinolysis − reduces blood fibrinogen * Humoral immunity − keeps blood circulation healthy * Hypolipidaemic − reduced high blood cholesterol * Immune modulator − repairs, brings balance to the immune system
For example, allicin is thought to be the key component involved in the process of vasodilation of the small capillaries and alveoli in the lungs, thus improving the circulation and breathing capacity. As such, it is beneficial to those with allergies, asthma and hay fever.
Many types of bacteria hate allicin − especially those that infest the throat, ears, chest and stomach. It can also kill E−coli; the antibiotic−resistant bacteria, Staphylococus aureus; and the Helicobacter pylori bacteria, the cause of most stomach ulcers.
John Hopkins Medical School reports the most common cause of sinusitis is a fungal infection. Allicin is very effective with many fungi, including Aspergillus, Candida, Coccidioides,
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide
13



Cryptotoccocci, Histoplasma and Trichophyton.
Medical researchers in America and Oxford, England have shown it to reduce cholesterol levels by 12−40%, when larger than maintenance amounts of allicin are consumed for a period of 6 weeks. Significant reduction of blood pressure was also experienced by the test subjects.
Recently, researchers in Pennsylvania have shown that by injecting an allicin compound, tumors can be reduced by half, and by adding Sallylcysteine, it can stop cancer−causing agents
from binding to human breast cells.
Longevity studies conducted by Dr. Narain at the Public Health Department in Delhi, India, revealed that 98% of all "centurions" studied consumed at least one
clove of garlic every day.
Chinese Wolfberry
A group of researchers from the Natural Science Institute discovered a region on the West Elbow Plateau of the Yellow River in Inner Mongolia where people lived to be over 120 years old. 20 to 40 years longer than the average person in the
region.
The inhabitants shared traits that distinguished them from others: They were predominantly vegetarians and consumed wolfberries daily.
Since the early 1980s, the Chinese wolfberry has been the subject of a number of important clinical studies, including several published by the State Scientific and Technological Commission in China.
These studies have documented the antioxidant and immune− stimulating properties of the Chinese wolfberry (
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide
14



Register #4848484 and #5858585). More recent studies in the 1990s have lent additional scientific support.
The Chinese wolfberry (known as Lycium barbarum by botanists and as goji berry by native Chinese) is more than just a complete food: it is a vitamin and mineral−filled antioxidant that contains over 15% protein by weight.
With more protein than bee pollen, more vitamin C than oranges and almost as much beta carotene as carrots, the wolfberry contains 21 essential amino minerals, including calcium, chromium, copper, magnesium, potassium and zinc.
The wolfberry is also rich in vitamin B1, Vitamin B2, vitamin B5 and biotin. Eight ounces of wolfberry contains over 40 times the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of vitamin B1 and over 10 times the RDA of niacin. The Wolfberry is most nutrient−dense
substance known.
According to a report of the State Scientific and Technological Commission of China, the wolfberry contains compounds known as lycium polysaccharides, which appeared to be highly effective in promoting immunity. These results were validated in a number of clinical trials.
In one study on a group of cancer patients, the wolfberry triggered an increase in both, lymphocyte transformation rate and white blood cell count (measures of immune function).
In another study involving a group of 50 people with lower−limit white blood cell counts, the wolfberry increased phagocytosis and the titre of serum antibodies (another index of immune function).
Unhealthy levels of titre of serum antibodies have long been associated with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (also known as Epstein−Barr). Does this mean that the wolfberry could be used as a weapon against Epstein−Barr? The possibilities are intriguing.
In another study, consumption of wolfberry lead to a strengthening of immunoglobulin A levels (an index of immune function). Because the decline of immunoglobulin A is one of the signs of aging, an increase in these levels suggests that the wolfberry may enable injured DNA to better repair itself and
ward off tissue degeneration.

Spirulina
Although Spirulina nourished people in Africa and America for centuries, scientists rediscovered its benefits only in this lifetime. This microalgae is 60% all−vegetable protein, rich in beta carotene, iron, vitamin B−12 and the rare essential fatty acid, GLA. It offers a striking profile of vitamins, minerals and phytonutrents. Scientific studies show remarkable health benefits.
World's highest beta carotene food reduces long term health risks.
Spirulina beta carotene is ten times more concentrated than carrots. So even if you don't eat the recommended 4 to 9 servings of fruits and vegetables every day (most people eat only 1−2, including french fries), get your natural beta carotene insurance from spirulina to help support your body's defenses.
60% easy−to−digest vegetable protein without the fat and cholesterol of meat.
People are eating less meat and dairy protein because they want to lower fat, cholesterol, and chemicals in their diet. Spirulina is the highest protein food with all the essential amino acids and has only a few calories to keep your waistline
where you want it.
A rare essential fatty acid is a key to health.
Gamma−linolenic acid (GLA) in mother's milk helps develop healthy babies. Studies show nutritional deficiencies can block GLA production in your body, so a good dietary source of GLA can be important. Spirulina is the only other whole food with GLA.
Iron for women and children's health.
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide
16



Iron is essential to build a strong system, yet is the most common mineral deficiency. Spirulina is rich in iron, magnesium and trace minerals, and is easier to absorb than iron supplements.
High in Vitamin B−12 and B Complex.
Spirulina is the highest source of B−12, essential for healthy nerves and tissue, especially for vegetarians.
Unusual phytonutrients for health and cleansing.
Scientists are discovering the benefits of polysaccharides, sulfolipids & glycolipids, and the rainbow of natural pigments that give spirulina a deep green color. Green (chlorophyll), blue (phycocyanin) and orange (carotenoids) colors collect the sun's energy and power growth. Chlorophyll is a natural cleanser
and is often referred to as nature's green magic.
Maca
For centuries, the Maca root has grown wild in the Peruvian Andes just below the glacial icecap. No other food plant exists in the world which will grow at so high an altitude and survive.
Native shepherds soon learned that as they grazed their herds in higher elevations, where Maca grows naturally, the herds became healthier, with more stamina and became much more sexually active.
Soon, the Andean Herd People included Maca in their diets, and found Maca could help promote increased energy and stamina for themselves.
The rich soil located at these high plateaus of Peru where it is very cold and oxygen poor may account for the high levels of trace minerals found in maca root. Some Peruvian Indians
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide
17



of today still grow it in the same traditional way without pesticides or chemicals.
The healing qualities of Maca have helped the local native population thrive in this oxygen−poor plateau where they live.
Maca root contains significant amounts of amino acids, complex carbohydrates, vitamins B1, B2, B12, C and E and minerals,
including calcium, phosphorus, zinc, magnesium and iron.
This herb has been traditionally used as:
* an aphrodisiac for both men and women * to increase energy, vitality, stamina and endurance in athletes * promote mental clarity * for fertility and to increase male seminal fluid volume, sperm count and sperm motility * for treating male impotence and erectile dysfunction * for female menstrual irregularities and hormone imbalances, including menopause and perimenopause
Women with menstrual irregularities have experienced greater consistency, while women with hot flashes, mood swings and most associated perimenopause and menopause symptoms have diminished dramatically.
Due to the number of steroidal glycosides present in Maca root it is gaining popularity among weight lifters and body builders as a natural alternative to anabolic steroids.
The popularity of maca worldwide is growing at an enormous rate.
Chorella
Chlorella is a single−celled freshwater green plant used as a whole food nutritional supplement. Because it is a whole food rather than a fractionalized extract or an isolated component, Chlorella contains all the beneficial components of the entire plant in naturally perfect balance.
In addition to highly bio−available vitamins and minerals,
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide
18



Chlorella contains significant amounts of vegetable protein, beta carotene and chlorophyll, known for its cleansing and purifying properties.
Additionally, the hard cell wall (broken during the drying process) provides important dietary fiber and further aids in internal cleansing.
Chlorella is related to Spirulina and Klamath Lake Blue Green Algae (often sold under the brand name of Super Blue−Green), all of which share the Green Foods category with things like wheat grass, barley grass and the juices from these plants.
Chlorella is a nutrition powerhouse. Chlorella provides all the nutrients necessary to live, including high levels of vegetable protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals, plus chlorophyll.
Chlorella is one of the most concentrated sources of beta carotene, calcium, magnesium and zinc available. The chlorophyll content is important as a nutrient because it has potent
detoxifying properties.
Additionally, chlorophyll bears a molecular structure identical to that of human blood, with the exception of one atom.
Red blood cells have an iron molecule whereas chlorophyll has a magnesium molecule. Because of the structural similarities, chlorophyll has the ability to carry oxygen directly into the blood stream.
Many people who use green food supplements regularly report substantial increases in energy and overall well−being. Also, consumption of green foods can dramatically improve the tone
and texture of the skin.
Stevia
"According to the Herb Research Foundation, numerous scientists, and tens of millions of consumers throughout the world,
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide
19



especially in Japan, the herb is safe and intensely sweet, which could make it a popular noncaloric sweetener." Rob McCaleb, president, Herb Research Foundation, Boulder, Colo., USA
"...as a scientist with over 15 years researching the safety of stevia and of many other plants used as food or food ingredients, I can assure that our conclusions in these various studies indicate that stevia is safe for human consumption as per intended usage, that is, as a sweetener." Mauro Alvarez, Ph.D., Brazil
"The petition cites over 120 articles about stevia written before 1958, and over 900 articles published to date. In this well−chronicled history of stevia, no author has ever reported any adverse human health consequences associated with consumption of stevia leaf." Supplement to GRAS affirmation petition no. 4G0406, submitted by the Thomas J. Lipton Company February 3, 1995
"Stevia leaf is a natural product that has been used for at least 400 years as a food product, principally as a sweetener or other flavoring agent. None of this common usage in foods has indicated any evidence of a safety problem.
There are no reports of any government agency in any of the above countries indicating any public health concern whatsoever in connection with the use of stevia in foods." Gras affirmation petition submitted on behalf of the American Herbal Products Association, April 23, 1992,
"...various extract forms of stevia have been extensively studied and tested. These tests include acute, sub−acute, carcinogenic evaluation and mutagenicity studies.
These scientific data, while not directly relevant or required for exemption under the common use in food proviso, nevertheless demonstrate cumulatively that there is no safety problem associated with the use of an extract of stevia.
It appear to be extraordinarily safe." Introduction to GRAS affirmation petition submitted by the American Herbal Products Association, April 23, 1992
The Japanese either banned or strictly regulated artificial sweeteners during the 1960s, consistent with a popular movement away from allowing chemicals in the food supply. They soon
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide
20



discovered the ideal replacement for both sugar and its synthetic substitutes: refined stevia extracts.
Originally introduced to Japan in 1970 by a consortium of food−product manufacturers, stevioside and other stevia products quickly caught on. By 1988, they reportedly represented approximately 41% of the market share of potently sweet substances consumed in Japan.
In addition to widespread use as a tabletop sweetener, like the packets of saccharin ("Sweet−n−Low®") and aspartame ("Equal®") commonly found in the United States, Stevia was also used by the Japanese to sweeten a variety of food products, including ice cream, bread, candies, pickles, seafood, vegetables, and soft drinks.
In addition to demonstrating stevia's nearly instant popularity in locales far removed from its native habitat, Japan's experience proved several other significant facts about this phenomenal plant: its adaptability and its safety.
Adaptability was proven through the discovery that the plant could be grown throughout most of this temperate island nation, albeit under special hothouse conditions.
Studies were even initiated to evaluate the substitution of stevia for rice under cultivation in some areas. Stevia's safety was proven through extensive scientific testing.
The spread of the stevia phenomenon was not limited to Japan.
Today it is also grown and used in approximately 10 other countries outside South America, including China, Germany, Malaysia, Israel and South Korea.
Stevia might by now be entrenched in the United States as well,
had it not been for a concerted effort to block its very entry.
Saw Palmetto
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide
21



Saw Palmetto has long been used in Europe to treat an enlarged prostate or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). American use lags far behind Europe in part because Americans are not aware of the extensive European research on the herb, some of which is presented here.
The most cited journal article is an early (1984) "letter to the editors" by G. Champault et al. American physicians generally don't prescribe any drug other than Finasteride (Proscar®), Terazosin HCI (Hytrin®), or Doxazosin mesylate (Cardura®) for BPH.
But unlike these drugs, particularly Proscar®, Saw Palmetto usually kicks in quickly. With the Saw Palmetto extract most men achieve some relief of symptoms within the first 30 days.
Saw Palmetto is, according to industry sources, one species with several different names, including Serenoa repens, Serenoa serrulata, and sabal.
Florida is the biggest producer of Saw Palmetto. Small patches can be found from the southeast coastline of South Carolina and southeastern Georgia to southern Mississippi.
But it does not grow naturally in Texas, Mexico, or the Caribbean.
It grows in every Florida county, but much of its production
centers in South Florida.
New Research Report:
A long−term study of 150 men with clinically diagnosed BPH and complaints of prostatic symptoms has demonstrated "the long−term efficacy and tolerability of Permixon and support its use as a first−line medical therapy for uncomplicated symptomatic BPH."
Permixon is a brand of standardized Saw Palmetto extract sold widely in Europe. This study conducted by the Scientific Research Institute of Urology, Moscow, Russia.
The study's conclusions are impressive:
At 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, the International Prostate Symptom Score (I−PSS), quality of life, and sexual function score were recorded, and urodynamics and biologic values were measured.
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide
22



Adverse events were recorded every 3 months. I−PSS and quality of life improved significantly from baseline at each evaluation time point.
At the end of the study and at each evaluation, maximum urinary flow also improved significantly. Prostate size decreased. Sexual function remained stable during the first year of treatment and significantly improved (P = .001) during the second year.
Prostate−specific antigen was not affected, and no changes in plasma hormone levels were observed. Nine patients reported 10 adverse events, none related to treatment.
Improvements in efficacy parameters began at 6 months and were maintained up to 24 months.
As valuable as Saw Palmetto is you should not consider it alone for BPH. There is also some evidence suggesting that a low−fat diet, zinc supplements, and essential fatty acids (from sources such as flax oil) and another herb, Pygeum africanum, are useful for treating BPH. Some warn that men with BPH should avoid alcohol. You should also be sure to consult an M.D., especially for a prostate−specific antigen (PSA) test and a digital rectal examination (DRE) to rule out prostate cancer.
Here are some findings on studies of Saw Palmetto:
Typically, they found that prostatic volume was significantly decreased during the study—averaging 9% after 45 days and 10% after 90 days.
Patients subjectively said that Saw Palmetto helped. 83% said it was effective after 45 days and 88% said it was effective after 90 days.
Objectively, physicians agreed. After 45 days 81% of physicians said it was effective, and this percentage increased to 88% after 90 days.
No serious side effects were reported. Only 25 patients reported a total of 32 side effects, half of which were limited to gastrointestinal symptoms. Side effects warranted premature discontinuation of saw palmetto in only 2% of the patients. (In an earlier study by Braeckman of 238 patients for one month he
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide
23



found that only 3% reported any side effects, all minor, compared with 4% of those receiving placebos.)
The effects of Saw Palmetto begin to take place after 30 to 45 days. This is an advantage over most currently available drugs for which delays may be as high as six to 12 months

Herbal Remedies for Diabetes
You have just been diagnosed with diabetes.
Chances are you have lots of questions running around inside your brain such as why and how did I get this disease?
* Which type of diabetes do I have? * What can I eat if I have diabetes? * What affects my blood sugar? * How do I check my blood sugar? * Why me and not the next guy next door?
Or maybe you even go into denial that you actually have the disease? I had all these questions and doubts, and I still have many more that I need answered.
If you have been diagnosed with diabetes, it is not the end of the world. These days almost one fifth of the world’s population has been told that they have diabetes.
This is even more so in developed countries because of the processed food diets we are so found of. In the US, more than twenty million cases of diabetes have been diagnosed.
Your first thought after hearing of your diagnosis may have been that you cannot live with the condition. However, please understand that diabetes is quite manageable.
It is a learning process like with any other problem solving exercise, and like all disease, the search for more knowledge should never stop.
Testing has shown that people who have HBA1Cs above 5.8 have a 92 percent chance of being diabetic as determined by a fasting glucose tolerance test. The HBA1C test does not require fasting and can be done with only one draw of blood, while the glucose tolerance test takes seven.
It is less expensive and has the potential to save a lot of lives by getting diabetics into treatment earlier.

Earlier detection of diabetes will help prevent or control many of the problems associated with this disease.
So many different health problems can be and often are associated with diabetes that many people just simply don’t realize that they have the disease until it’s too late.
Early detection as with any disease is very important so that you can begin controlling it as soon as possible, thus reducing your risk for the more serious problems associated with diabetes.
It's essential for people with diabetes to take care of them selves.
To help you take the first steps toward better diabetes care, we will discuss some of the common treatments and information available for people who have been recently diagnosed with diabetes, or those just needing or looking for some basic information.
Once you are diagnosed with diabetes, you will need to identify a doctor that you want to care for you for the rest of your life.
This can be very difficult in this day and age of HMO’s and such, but you need to find someone who will get to know you and your condition intimately in order to provide you with the best care.
You cannot make diabetes go away. You will have to face it and begin learning to live with it. “Learning to live with it”.
I repeated this because you need to understand this is a life long disease at the moment and even if you get to a point of control that the disease is almost non−perceivable, it is still there in the back ground.
Your doctor will very likely recommend some type of monitoring equipment for carrying with you to perform regular blood sugar testing.
This is important because you must understand how your body responds to diabetes and the best way for “you” to control “your” disease.

It is possible that Medicare or other insurance may cover your glucose meter and strips. You may be reimbursed by the policy for the cost.
After being diagnosed with diabetes, you will want to know what diabetes−related information and activities are available in your community.
You should check out what's happening locally so that you can learn more about support groups, fund−raising events and other ways you can help raise awareness about this disease.
And yes diabetes is a disease, so make sure you treat it like one. It’s a treatable disease and in some circles, a “curable” disease. We will discuss some of these options later in this article.
Diabetes and Your Diet:
Obesity is a major risk factor especially for adult onset type II diabetes. Diabetes is often more of an environmental disease than just a genetic one. Your genes only have a bearing on how you respond to the environment.
Most studies would agree that everyone should exercise and limit refined carbohydrates such as flour and sugar, whether or not there is a family history of diabetes.
This is just common sense but to most of us, especially here in America, we choose to ignore that simple fact.
We are prone to sedentary life styles and we are not terribly consistent about keeping up with regular exercise and healthy eating habits.
The first thing that you need to plan on doing is getting regular exercise. Walking is the most preferred form. If have leg problems, a nice alternative is swimming. Exercise doesn’t have to be excessive to be beneficial.
Just taking a walk with your special someone every day or at least every other day can provide you with good benefits towards controlling diabetes. If you are offered the choice of taking the stairs or the elevator, then opt for
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide
27



the stairs and burn some calories.
If you have access to exercise equipment, make use of it.
This might be at home or at your local gym. Dust off the equipment you stored in the closet, under your bed, or in the basement, and use it. You’ll thank yourself for it.
One very important subject we need to discuss is nutrition, because by eating well−balanced meals in the correct amounts, you can keep your blood sugar level as close to normal (non−diabetes level) as possible.
Another thing that is very important to do in your quest to control your diabetes is exercise, because regular physical activity will help you manage your diabetes, and help you with your weight loss.
Losing as little as 10−15 pounds may help you better manage your diabetes. We will also discuss traditional and then some herbal remedies and treatments that are available to help you with your new health challenge.
Diabetes is no laughing matter and has become much more prevalent, especially in developed countries than most people realize.
Another very important thing that you need to do is “eat less”. Remember that you will be able have better control of your diabetes if you are within your weight limits. Most diabetic patients are over weight.
Cut down on weight and half your problems are solved, not to mention that you will look healthier with less flab. The best foods are barley and brown bread. Learn to keep a tab of what you eat and what you could avoid eating.
This where you home testing will come in handy that we discussed earlier. Check your blood glucose after a meal to understand how your blood sugar levels are affected.
If your glucose levels are high then avoid the particular dish causing the increase and find something that causes less of an change in your levels.
Your diet must become the cornerstone of your diabetic

treatment; let it not become the headstone! I might sound rude to you for passing on this sort of crude observation, but in the interest of your health and well−being, you must be forewarned.
It sets the person with diabetes thinking about each meal and even each ounce of food that you eat what will be the result when it goes to the stomach? You will live in a state of fear psychosis if your not careful though.
Food become a necessary evil for the diabetic but it need not be. It should be a source of enjoyment and not punishment, but you have to invest in it wisely.
Your testing will help you budget your day according to your food requirements. You need to learn to take in smaller amounts of food at periodic intervals, rather than taking two heavy meals.
If you learn to do this according to your natural lifestyle, you will be much happier about what you eat. Don't treat your food and eating habits as a bad thing.
Enjoy it, every bite of it. It is your food for both−your mind and body, and taking care of your mind is as important as taking care of your body.
Diabetes & High Cholesterol − Being a diabetic increases your risk of having high cholesterol, a condition that can lead to heart disease and stroke.
Heart disease alone is the number one killer for both men and women in the United States, so high cholesterol is a condition that should not be taken lightly. It is vital for you to know how high cholesterol affects your health and what you can do to prevent the serious complications associated with it.
High cholesterol and the effects that it has on the body are all important to understand in keeping your diabetes under control.
Do you have high cholesterol and what is it? Cholesterol is the fatty substance that our bodies use for many important functions, including to help digest fat.
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide
29



The body needs cholesterol, but when there is too much of it in the blood, it can build up inside the arteries, narrow them or even clog them.
This serious condition, called atherosclerosis, can lead to heart attack or stroke. The “right amount” of cholesterol seems to vary from doctor to doctor and clinical trial to clinical trial.
If you are a diabetic, the American Diabetes Association recommends these targets for your cholesterol levels:
LDL Cholesterol: Below 100 mg/dl HDL Cholesterol: Above 50 mg/dl
Getting Older and Having Diabetes:
Physical sickness or any kind, combined with mental sickness is a double tragedy. Old age in itself, without any additional sickness is a serious sickness.
In old age when the confidence level of any individual is low and when the fingers tremble, when the medication tablets on the palm dance and when you have trouble in drinking even a glass of water, all seems to be lost.
Certainly diabetes is an added burden for those already struggling with all of the usual afflictions of old age and adding diabetes to that can be a real burden, both to the individual and the patient. An caring family will play a huge role in curing an old age diabetic patient.
The very feeling for an old age diabetic patient that he is being taken care by his near and dear ones is half the cure. You notice we use the term “cure” here. More on that later. A diabetic patient in the later stages of life needs two types of medicine.
One is the medicine of love, and other is the medicine of understanding. This is probably more or at least as important that the medications being prescribed by the doctor.
How do I fight the disease? – You must accept that Diabetes is a serious type of disease. I can not be taken lightly

and often requires well beyond the normal care for many people.
Diabetes as a disease is bad enough in itself, but the things you really have to watch out for are the things that having diabetes make you prone to, such as heart diseases, certain types of cancer and osteoporosis.
So, knowing that you are now more prone to these issues what should the diabetes patient to be fully armed with complete information about diabetes?
For one, they need to know their present state of health and lay down unassailable rules for themselves in regards to their daily living.
Your top aim should be to maintain an optimum, healthy weight. Secondly, don't be lazy, lying down on the couch, relaxing on the bed. This extra rest that you are forcing on yourself may ruin your health.
As for the food, take plenty of fruits and vegetables. You may have to learn how to eat certain foods that are not on your current favorites list, but they will be necessary for your survival.
Having the correct information may save you from lots of troubles.
Herbs and Diabetes:
A connection has been made lately between the use of cinnamon and the ability to prevent certain diabetes symptoms.
Cinnamon, has been used for years as a spice that assists with energy. This can be an inexpensive form of help for the control of diabetes.
Studies on the possible cinnamon effects on has been able to isolate the sourced compound in cinnamon that is a responsible for a portion of the superb effects that this substance has on diabetes.
This compound partially composed of specific type A
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide
31



polymers, has been found to lower the blood sugar effectively in some people with diabetes.
Plus, it was found at these polymers had a positive effect on total cholesterol in some patients by up to 25%.
Possibly of even more importance of this fact are the effects that it can have on practically millions of people who have been found to have prediabetes.
This possibly mild help delay the diabetes onset, and give those potential future diabetics time to learn about how to keep it from taking control over their health.
These cinnamon polymers have been found to assist diabetics and two important ways. The substance has been shown to make the enzymes that may be responsible for decreasing the effects of insulin resistance, which is the most common issue especially with adult onset type II diabetes.
When diabetics used this compound, their sensitivity to insulin was found to increase within their systems.
The substance has been patented as a compound known as Cinnulin PF. The only approved version for use is a water−soluble extract of this compound. It should not be hard to find as there are many different supplements that contain it.
It is important that a person with diabetes does not ingest high quantities of normal cinnamon in order to try and get these effects, because ingesting high levels of cinnamon has been found to be toxic due to a fat soluble component it has.
If for some reason you are not able to find this component in a supplement that contains it, you should limit yourself to a quarter to a full teaspoon of cinnamon daily to help your diabetes condition.
It is as with any herb or drug, important to inform your doctor of any supplements or medications that you take in order to help diabetes. You can typically add the supplement to various drinks including tea or milkshakes to make it more tolerable to take.
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide
32



Don't think that you might want to eat apple pie because it has cinnamon in it. Apple pie or foods like it probably should be avoided for the most part because of the fat and sugar content.
Other traditional herbal and natural remedies have been shown to have benefits − Some experts have said some of the treatments used around the world had properties, which may help treat conditions such as diabetes and cancer.
Some of these included India's curry leaf tree, which is reputed to treat diabetes. Extracts from the curry−leaf tree appeared to restrict the action of a digestive enzyme called pancreatic alpha−amylase which is involved in the breakdown of dietary starch to glucose.
Full clinical trials would have to be carried out to confirm the treatments' benefits, as at this point there isn’t enough data to fully support the finding.
Some researchers have also examined Indian diabetes treatments such as Ghanaian wound healing agents and cancer treatments used in China and Thailand.
A patient with diabetes does not produce enough insulin to cope with rapid rises in blood glucose levels. Slowing the rate of starch breakdown, by blocking alpha−amylase, can lead to a more even trickle of glucose into the bloodstream from the intestine.
The researchers are now looking at which compound in the curry−leaf tree has this effect. They say that, once it has been identified, it should be possible to evaluate if it could be better than existing anti−diabetic drugs.
Some other experts also looked at plants used by the Ashanti ethnic group. They have interviewed traditional healers of the area to identify certain plants that are used to help wound healing.
They have found an extract of the Commelina diffusa, which is the known as the climbing dayflower, had both antibacterial and antifungal activity. This would suggest it could help wounds heal and stop them getting infected
which can be common in diabetic patients.
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide
33



Bitter Melon is another plant that has shown blood sugar lowering actions. The fresh juice or extract of the unripe fruit has been clearly established in both experimental and clinical studies to date.
Diabetics are also shown to be chronically short of minerals and they need to add a good−quality, broad−spectrum mineral supplement to their diet.
Goldenseal should help but not cure diabetes. A tincture extract can be taken at about 15 drops, two to three times a day.
Some studies are showing that onions can reduce blood sugar levels for longer periods of time than insulin, but more slowly. You should have plenty in your diet.
It is best to eat them raw because cooking them partially destroys its active ingredients, which are contained in highly volatile oil.
Same as with onions, garlic has been shown to have a significant ability to control blood sugar levels.
Garlic has a strong odor so you might want take it as a supplement. Either way try to ensure your diet is rich in garlic.
Fenugreek contains compounds that can help regulate your blood sugar levels too. Some recent research shows that fenugreek seeds can lower blood glucose and reduce insulin levels, plus a bonus is that it has been shown to reduce total cholesterol and triglycerides.
I has also been shown to increase HDL (the good cholesterol). Olive leaf can lower blood sugar levels and to help dilate the walls of blood vessels.
Blood flow and circulation through the body and to the vital organs is very important, and it has been shown to have no side effects even when taken over a long period, so it is good for diabetics.
Cayenne pepper is a wonderful herb to stimulate circulation. When your blood is circulating more efficiently you don't need as much of the chemicals that
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide
34



your body produces. A little will go a long way.
Ginseng is also being shown as good for diabetes.
Some other less common herbal remedies have shown some promise in treating diabetes and they are Cumin, Dandelion, Indian Kino tree, Malabar Kino tree and Yacon.
Stevia is a no calorie natural sweetener and a wonderful alternative to artificial sweeteners.
Banana has been used in the Philippines for the treatment of diabetes and as always, natural fish oils maintain healthy blood flow.
In conclusion:
Help yourself.
Try to eliminate or reduce sugar, fructose, glucose, corn syrup, white bread, honey, molasses, maple syrup, fruit juice or concentrate and other processed foods.
White bread, cookies, cakes, pastry, and simple carbohydrates increase the risk for diabetes. Reduce foods cooked at high temperatures.
Eat more high fiber foods such as whole grain bread for simple white bread or pasta carbohydrates. Avoid sugar−sweetened beverages as they all put you at higher risk of both diabetes and obesity.
Try losing some weight, if possible. It’s not is not easy, but give it a try as the benefits are insurmountable.
Overweight and obese individuals are at increased risk of developing insulin resistance, in which the body loses sensitivity to the hormone insulin, causing blood sugar levels to soar.
Stop smoking if you do!
Epidemic Type II diabetes is said by some to be curable. I will leave it to you to decide this for your self as there is not enough data yet to support this conclusion although I would not ignore the possibility.

They claim that the first step to curing diabetes is to stop believing the lie that the disease is incurable.
At any rate, diabetes can be helped.

Herbal Remedies for High Blood Pressure
Everyone has heard of high blood pressure but what is the medical definition?
Well, the National Institute of Health defines high blood pressure as "a blood pressure level of 140/90 mmHg or higher". The medical term is hypertension.
Just what is blood pressure anyway?
Well, blood pressure is the force that the blood exerts against the walls of the arteries and veins circulating in your body.
High blood pressure is when the blood pressure remains elevated over a long period of time.
An interesting statistic that the National Institute of Health point out is the fact that people 55 years old or older have a 90 percent chance of developing high blood pressure during their lifetime.
This means that high blood pressure is a condition that most people will develop at some point in their lives.
Since most people will develop high blood pressure, what can be done about this condition? Everyone understands that if you have high blood pressure, you need to loose some weight and perform some sort of exercise (healthy lifestyle).
But is there any other alternatives?
Research has shown that herbal remedies for high blood pressure do work. If you are taking blood pressure medicine and want to try some of the herbal remedies in this article, it is very important that you consult with your doctor before making any changes.
Symptoms of High Blood Pressure
Some of the more common symptoms of high blood pressure include:
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide
37



Fatigue and weakness Dizziness Difficulty in breathing Flushed face Insomnia Intestinal problems Nervousness
Causes of High Blood Pressure
The number one cause of high blood pressure is heredity; the underlying cause is unclear at this time. Multiple factors are usually involved including:
Obesity Dietary factors High cholesterol Diabetes Stress Smoking Coffee and Alcohol consumption
Natural Treatment for High Blood Pressure
For mildly elevated blood pressure, doctors usually recommend dietary and lifestyle changes for a period of time to see if this will normalize the blood pressure.
Remember, it is very important to work with your doctor as untreated high blood pressure can lead to heart attack, stroke, brain hemorrhage and kidney failure at an early age.
Diet
Adequate intake of calcium, magnesium and potassium are necessary for blood pressure control. If the diet is lacking in these minerals, supplements many be required to improve blood pressure control.
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide
38



Foods that are high in calcium include:
Milk (all kinds) Cheese yogurt Canned Sardines with bones Spinach, fresh or cooked Turnip greens, fresh or cooked Whole Almonds Kale, frozen and cooked Broccoli, fresh or cooked Collards, fresh or cooked Beans, dried or cooked Cottage Cheese Prepared Pudding Light Ice Cream Apricots Artichokes Beet Greens Blackeye Peas Brussel Sprouts Cashew Nuts Cauliflower cooked Lettuce Figs Molasses − dark Okra raw or cooked Olives Parsley Peanuts roasted and salted Sunflower Seeds Baked Sweet Potatoes
Foods that are high in magnesium include:
Bananas Nuts Rice Potatoes Wheat Germ Kidney and Lima beans Molasses
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide
39



Foods that are rich in potassium include:
Bananas Cantaloupe Grapefruit Oranges Nectarines Asparagus Broccoli Cabbage Cauliflower Green peas Potatoes Squash
Herbal and Nutritional Remedies
The herbal and nutritional remedies for high blood pressure include but not limited to the following:
Garlic (Allium Sativum) Co Q10 Hawthorn Motherwort Lime Blossom Kudzu (Pueraria Lobata) Saffron (Crocus Sativus) Valerian (Valeriana Officinalis) Mistletoe (Viscum Album) Green Tea Fo−ti (ho shou wu, Polygonum multiflorum) Grape seed extract with oligomeric proanthocyanidins Cordyceps
Garlic (Allium Sativum)
Some case studies report that garlic can lower blood pressure by a small amount; additional studies are needed to confirm this effect.
Garlic also improves the HDL (High Density Lipoprotein)
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide
40



ratio to LDL (low Density Lipoprotein) and reduces the oxidation of blood fats.
Dr. George Jacob indicates eating one clove of garlic per day aided in the management of Hypertension.
Dosage:
o In clinical studies, garlic tablets were effective at a dose of 600−900 mg per day of high−quality garlic powder.
o The dose of aged garlic used in trials was 4 capsules (a total of 4 ml) per day.
o The dose of garlic oil "perles" used in a recent study showing cholesterol−lowering effects was 10 mg per day, equivalent to 3−4 grams or 1 moderate size fresh clove.
o Garlic can be used in your daily cooking, soups and salads and several other food preparations.
Caution: People taking anticoagulant drugs should check with their doctor since garlic has anti−clotting properties.
Co Q10
Studies have shown a reduction in blood pressure after several weeks of treatment. Co Q10 seems to correct some abnormality in the body associated with high blood pressure.
There is no established dose of Co Q10 in the clinical trials being conducted. The dosage used in small trials were from 60 to 225 mg per day, with significant blood pressure drop taking up to 12 weeks of daily usage.
Hawthorn (Crataegus Oxycantha)
Hawthorn is believed to reduce blood pressure and is a well known herbal in traditional medicine according to Dr. Irene Catania (a naturopathic doctor and homeopathic practioner). Hawthorn, used by it self is seldom enough to make a significant difference.
In addition to lowering blood pressure, Hawthorn maintains
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide
41



a health heart. The typical dose of Hawthorn is 100 to 300 mg, three times a day. The full effects of lowering blood pressure will take several weeks to months to work.
There are no long term side effects with other prescription drugs. Large dosages may cause a significant drop in blood pressure that might lead to fainting.
Motherwort (Leonurus Cardiaca)
Motherwort is used as a tonic for the heart and can be used in all heart conditions that are associated with anxiety and tension. It is usually combined with Hawthorn for treating heart related problems.
Consult with your doctor for reactions with your prescription medicines.
Lime Blossom (Tilia Europea)
Lime Blossom is used for the treatment of high blood pressure and is taken by infusion. The typical recipe includes one cup of boiling water poured over one teaspoon of the dried flowers. Let it infuse for ten minutes, then filter and drink.
Kudzu (Pueraria Lobata)
This herb has been known in traditional Chinese for centuries as ge−gen and is used for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal support, angina, and high blood
pressure.
Studies performed in China indicate that Kudzu helps to normalize blood pressure. In one study, 32% of the people showed a marked decline in their blood pressure over a 2 to 8 week period. The dosage was a tea that contained about 8 teaspoons of Kudzu root.
Kudzu is a good antioxidant; about 100 times more powerful than vitamin E. Therefore, Kudzu helps to prevent heart disease and cancer according to Dr. George Jacob, Heart Infocenter.
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide

Saffron (Crocus Sativus)
The active ingredient in Saffron is crocentin which lowers blood pressure. It can be used in cooking; it is very popular seasoning used in Arabic cooking. Brewed tea can be made using Saffron giving it a distinctive flavor. This herb is very expensive to use.
Caution: when used in large dosages, it can damage the central nervous system and kidneys. Fatal dose for humans is 10 to 12 grams. The high cost of Saffron makes its use in herbal medicine a rare event.
Valerian (Valeriana Officinalis)
The active ingredient in Valerian is valerenic acid which inhibits an enzyme that breaks down gamma−amino buturic acid which controls high blood pressure.
Mistletoe (Viscum Album)
It is believed that Mistletoe regulates blood pressure which provides a healing effect for hypertension and hypotension.
Treatments in Europe combine Mistletoe with Hawthorn.
Green Tea (Camellis Sinensis)
The active ingredients in Green Tea are polyphenols, and in particular a catechin called epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). These polyphenols are believed to provide the blood pressure lowering qualities.
Research documenting the health effects of green tea is based on the amount of green tea that is consumed in Asian countries; the average person consumes three cups of green tea a day. This equate to 240 to 320 mg of polyphenols.
Green tea is safe to use and the most common side effects from consuming large quantities of green tea is insomnia, anxiety, and other effects from the caffeine content in
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide
43



green tea.
Cordyceps
Cordyceps is a Chinese mushroom used as an supplement, slows the heart rate, increase blood supply to the arteries and heart, and lower blood pressure.
A study in Canada provided information on a daily dosage of 20mg of Cordyceps along with 180mg of shark cartilage had a 75% success rate in obtaining a healthy blood pressure, according to Christpher Stewart, Medical Intuitive.
Cordyceps processes anti−aging and anti−oxidant properties that are required to maintain healthy microcirculation as documented in an article entitled "An experimental study on anti−aging action of Cordyceps extract Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi".
Additional research has suggested favorable results in lowering cholesterol levels that is another key factor in maintaining healthy cardiovascular system. Cordyceps is one of the most expensive of Chinese herbs.
Recommendations
While these herbs with stronger effects can be helpful in decreasing blood pressure, they can be toxic when taken in the wrong amounts and should only be used under the close supervision of an experienced practitioner of herbal medicine.
They should also not be consumed in conjunction with prescription medication for controlling blood pressure.
Several of the herb remedies for high blood pressure contain a combination of herbs. Therefore, it is very important that you discuss all herb remedies that you are taking with your doctor, especially if you are taking prescription blood pressure medicine.

Herbal Remedies for Menopause
Perhaps the first thing to understand is that menopause is not a disease and thus, should not be treated as one. When "fighting" a disease, the aim is to make it go away, or somehow stop.
Since menopause is really just a normal phase in a natural process, we shouldn't be trying to stop it, but rather, to normalize the body to facilitate the normal progression of life's internal events.
Although some people view the aging process itself as a disease, menopause is actually one of the normal changes that occurs as a woman ages.
That change is programmed into our physiology by Nature and tampering with it usually results in having to "pay the price."
That price may vary from simple discomfort for some women, to severe, debilitating disease, such as cancer, for others.
In a healthy body, this normal age progression should present minimal, if any, discomfort, and should proceed at a reasonable pace. A many−years long, drawn out menopause may be typical currently, but that doesn't mean it is normal... or healthy.
The use of drugs, in particular, those known as HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy) and ERT (Estrogen Replacement Therapy), can have devastating effects on the body.
Animal cruelty (to produce the hormone) notwithstanding, this protocol may provide immediate relief to those suffering from this "change of life" process, but is also accompanied by potential and serious risks.
Risks include cancer, bone density conditions (such as osteoporosis), extending the menopause itself, strokes, heart disease, and even blood clots in the lungs.
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide
45



The hormones used in HRT aren’t even the right ones. The most common drug, PremPro, is a combination of Premarin (horse estrogen) and Provera (completely artificial progesterone).
However, studies done in Britain, and reported in the medical journal, The Lancet, August 9, 2003, showed that women using HRT had a 66% higher risk of developing breast cancer than women who did not use HRT.
A similar study, done earlier in the U.S., was reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association, on July 17, 2002, with the same findings, forcing the study to end earlier than planned.
Why treat one of life’s natural processes with artificial substances?
The medical community, after realizing the dangers, changed gears just a bit and began treating the uncomfortable symptoms of menopause with a different approach: tranquilizers and mood elevators... Zoloft, Paxil and Prozac... like the whole thing was just “in her head.”
However, distraught women still demand relief, and doctors feel pressed to continue using dangerous drugs, as if symptoms are the result of a drug deficiency.
We can take vitamins to cure problems that are from a vitamin deficiency, but no amount of fake estrogen is going to “cure” menopause. In fact, the dangers are real, and the risks have been documented.
A far better approach is the natural one.
Normalizing the body leads to a normal (and often faster) progression of this important time in a woman's life, and stands a better chance of resulting in a healthy and active period during the "golden years," where older and middle aged women don't have to feel old, tired or sick.
And they don’t have to risk dying earlier from breast cancer, heart disease or stroke.
A more normal and natural approach includes proper diet, exercise, and the use of certain supplements – including
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide
46



many herbs – which can be helpful in achieving a balanced body. Balance is the key.
Herbs have been used for all the time human beings have inhabited the planet. Ancient civilizations certainly must have used local plants for medicinal purposes, though categorization and documentation came much, much later.
Unfortunately, research is much too costly for herbal and nutritional companies to conduct, and the “official” scientific community lacks real interest in pursuing it, and thus, much of the reporting we find consists primarily of anecdotal or clinical studies done in smaller groups, for shorter periods, and usually reported in "lesser" publications.
Still, many women find great relief in using natural supplements and will, at the least, benefit by reducing their risk for developing certain cancers and an early death.
As with most alternative health practices, a word to the wise user consists of warnings... to use products and compounds cautiously, and with reference to authoritative sources. While most preparations are completely safe, there are herbal combinations that can be quite harmful.
Just because they come from plants does not guarantee that they are harmless.
Indeed, many of the drugs developed in the last 100 years originated from plant extracts. Thus, it is equally important to be wary of using herbs when also using drugs, as they may interact.
Perhaps the easiest way to select and use the proper herbs is to consult with herbalists, nutritionists, or alternative health practitioners with herbal studies under their belts.
What not to do is to simply dismiss the whole idea as useless simply because your family M.D. thinks it’s ridiculous because of his or her limited knowledge of the subject.

Herbs Commonly Used for Menopause:
According to a study done at Columbia University, the herb most likely to do the most good is an extract of Black Cohosh, called Remifemin.
Native Americans used Black Cohosh, which they called Black Snakeroot, by boiling the black, gnarly roots and drinking the “tea” to handle menstrual cramps and childbirth pain.
More recently, studies have shown that this herb has a serotonin−like effect, easing mood swings and other emotional problems of menopause.
However, it does not appear to help hot flashes, and in rare cases, can cause liver damage to women who are sensitive to aspirin, or are taking blood pressure medication. (Reported by the British news agency, BBC, July 18, 2006.)
Evening Primrose oil, also known as Borage oil, has been known to relieve breast pain and mood swings, but has no effect on hot flashes. No longer a prescription drug, it can be obtained over the counter.
Look for the GLA (gamma linoleic acid) content, and use 240 mg a day for 60 days, then reduce the amount gradually. While apparently safe, it can have a few side effects, including headaches, nausea, or skin rash. This preparation is used EXTERNALLY.
Another herb, Agnus Castus, is most useful for controlling hormonal fluctuations, and therefore, may be most helpful in handling menopausal symptoms − as long as hormones are not being taken from outside sources, such as HRT.
In Germany, Agnus Castus is most often used to treat ovarian problems and PMS (premenstrual syndrome).
Be careful with Kava Kava. While historically useful for easing anxiety, it is now known to cause liver damage.
Sage seems to help some women with hot flashes, with some effect on regulating hormones. It can be taken as a tea or as an extract.
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide
48



Wild Yam: While many menopause formulas are from the wild yam, studies now show there is no effect on hormone regulation at all, and positive reports may be due to a placebo effect.
St. John’s Wort is a traditional, well−known anti−depressant, relieving anxiety for many, and can be helpful for women during menopause.
However, because this herb is so active, it can have some rather drastic interactions with prescription drugs, including Digoxin, asthma drugs, HIV drugs, oral contraceptives, migraine drugs, Warfarin, Cyclosporin, and anti−epilepsy drugs.
St. John’s Wort should not be used with other anti−depressants. Check with a pharmacist for possible interactions if considering using this herb.
Other herbs that have been used for menopausal symptoms are Dong Quai, Red Clover, Ginseng and Valerian Root.
Just be sure to consult with an expert before using any herbs.

Herbal Remedies for Weight Loss
There are millions of people who are searching for new ways to lose weight everyday and you are probably one of them.
If you are anything like me, you want more energy during the day. You want look better in and out of your clothes. You want to feel better about yourself. You want to be healthier and live a long life.
So you turn to the latest fad. Ab machines, diet plans, workout regimens and even hypnotism are the latest ways to win the battle of the bulge.
But perhaps instead of always looking forward, we should look backwards for answers.
Our ancestors didn't worry about diabetes, prostate cancer and other illnesses like we do now and they certainly weren't as overweight as we are now.
Why do you think that is? Probably because they did more physical work, ate more natural foods and they knew a secret that we have long since forgotten.
They knew the power of herbs.
Now you might say to yourself, "What is an herb?" I've used them in cooking. I've even had some herbal tea, but I just don't know exactly what an herb is.
The dictionary defines a herb as:
1.a flowering plant whose stem above ground does not become woody.
2. such a plant when valued for its medicinal properties, flavor, scent, or the like.
Did you catch the "medicinal properties"? Long before herbs were used to season a pot of spaghetti, chicken curry or skillet full of fajitas. Herbs were used for medcine. In

fact, herbalism is the study of medicinal herbs from around the world.
All cultures have long folk medicine histories that include the use of plants. There is evidence that Neanderthal man used plants for healing over 60,000 years ago.
Middle East medicine. The invention of writing was a focus around which herbal knowledge could accumulate and grow.
The first written records detailing the use of herbs in the treatment of illness are the Mesopotamian clay tablet writings and the 'Egyptian Papyrus'.
About 2000 B.C., King Assurbanipal of Sumeria ordered the compilation of the first known materia medica−−an ancient form of today's United States Pharmacopoeia−−containing 250 herbal drugs (including garlic, still a favorite of herbal doctors).
The 'Ebers Papyrus', the most important of the preserved Egyptian manuscripts, was written around 1500 B.C. and includes much earlier information. It contains 876 prescriptions made up of more than 500 different substances, including many herbs (Ackerknecht, 1973).
Greece and Rome. One of the earliest materia medica was the Rhizotomikon, written by Diocles of Caryotos, a pupil of Aristotle.
Unfortunately, the book is now lost. Other Greek and Roman compilations followed, but none was as important or influential as that written by Dioscorides in the 1st century A.D., better known by its Latin name De Materia Medica.
This text contains 950 curative substances, of which 600 are plant products and the rest are of animal or mineral origin (Ackerknecht, 1973). Each entry includes a drawing, a description of the plant, an account of its medicinal qualities and method of preparation, and warnings about undesirable effects.
Muslim world. The Arabs preserved and built on the body of knowledge of the Greco−Roman period as they learned of new remedies from remote places. They even introduced to the

West the Chinese technique of chemically preparing minerals.
The principal storehouse of the Muslim materia medica is the text of Jami of Ibn Baiar (died 1248 A.D.), which lists more than 2,000 substances, including many plant products (Ackerknecht, 1973).
Eventually this entire body of knowledge was reintroduced to Europe by Christian doctors traveling with the Crusaders.
Indeed, during the Middle Ages, trade in herbs became a vast international commerce.
India, located between China and the West, underwent a similar process in the development of its medicine. The healing that took place before India's Ayurvedic medical corpus was similar to that of ancient Egypt or China (i.e., sickness was viewed as a punishment from the gods for a particular sin).
Ayurvedic medicine emerged during the rise of the philosophies of the Upanishads, Buddhism, and other schools of thought in India.
Herbs played an important role in Ayurvedic medicine.
The principal Ayurvedic book on internal medicine, the 'Characka Samhita', describes 582 herbs (Majno, 1975).
The main book on surgery, the 'Sushruta Samhita', lists some 600 herbal remedies. Most experts agree that these books are at least 2,000 years old.
China and Japan. The earliest written evidence of the medicinal use of herbs in China consists of a corpus of 11 medical works recovered from a burial site in Hunan province.
The burial itself is dated 168 B.C., and the texts (written on silk) appear to have been composed before the end of the 3rd century B.C. Some of the texts discuss exercise, diet, and channel therapy.
The largest, clearest, and most important of these

manuscripts, called by its discoverers 'Prescriptions for Fifty−Two Ailments', is predominantly a pharmacological work. More than 250 medicinal substances are named.
Most are substances derived from herbs and wood; grains, legumes, fruits, vegetables, and animal parts are also mentioned.
Underlying this entire text is the view that disease is the manifestation of evil spirits, ghosts, and demons that must be repelled by incantation, rituals, and spells in addition to herbal remedies.
By the Later Han Dynasty (25−220 A.D.), medicine had changed dramatically in China. People grew more confident of their ability to observe and understand the natural world and believed that health and disease were subject to the principles of natural order.
However, herbs still played an important part in successive systems of medicine.
The Classic of the Materia Medica, compiled no earlier than the 1st century A.D. by unknown authors, was the first Chinese book to focus on the description of individual herbs. It includes 252 botanical substances, 45 mineral substances, and 67 animal−derived substances.
For each herb there is a description of its medicinal effect, usually in terms of symptoms. Reference is made to the proper method of preparation, and toxicities are noted (Bensky and Gamble, 1993).
Since the writing of the Classic of the Materia Medica almost 2,000 years ago, the traditional Chinese materia medica have been steadily increasing in number.
This increase has resulted from the integration into the official tradition of substances from China's folk medicine as well as from other parts of the world.
Many substances now used in traditional Chinese medicine originate in places such as Southeast Asia, India, the Middle East, and the Americas.
The most recent compilation of Chinese materia medica was
THE_Herbal_Remedies_Guide
53



published in 1977. The Encyclopedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine Substances (Zhong yao da ci dian), the culmination of a 25−year research project conducted by the Jiangsu College of New Medicine, contains 5,767 entries and is the most definitive compilation of China's herbal tradition to date (Bensky and Gamble, 1993).
Traditional Chinese medicine was brought to Japan via Korea, and Chinese−influenced Korean medicine was adapted by the Japanese during the reign of Emperor Ingyo (411−453 A.D.).
Medical envoys continued to arrive from Korea throughout the next century, and by the time of the Empress Suiko (592−628 A.D.), Japanese envoys were being sent directly to China to study medicine.
Toward the end of the Muromachi period (1333−1573 A.D.) the Japanese began to develop their own form of traditional oriental medicine, called kampo medicine.
As traditional Chinese medicine was modified and integrated into kampo medicine, herbal medicine was markedly
simplified.

Herbal Gardening With Tire Crafting
Used tires in landfills will not decompose for many years and will tend to rise to the surface. Tires are so common and durable that they are a global environmental and discard problem.
They can be useful as a construction and crafting material for herbal gardening.
Not only do tires make a convenient container for herbs and can be very colorful when cleaned and painted.
Herbal gardening can be fun and very rewarding, Now that sounds good however I only have a rooftop, sloping hillside, brushy ground cover, no patio and very undesirable soil for a herb garden.
Tire crafting for your herbs can be used anywhere as it can be used in any setting.
Painted it can be a beautiful raised container for your herbs that is very durable and rids our landfills of another tire.
Some states are charging a fee to dispose of used tires and sell them to remanufacturing plants to turn back into usable products.

55



Used tires as a container for your herbs and vegetables provide a secure and easy way to grow and harvest your garden.
Not only will it last for years and can be filled with compost and soil that a certain vegetable requires to be productive.

Tire containers filled with homemade compost/growing medium are the only method of gardening that offers affordable, available, quality gardening to everyone.
Rocky hillsides, ocean beaches, alkali flats, porches, patios, mobile home spaces, house boats, roof tops are examples of why everyone can't have gardens.
No matter how limited their funds, how poor their existing soil, how limited or irregular the existing space, everyone can now have a garden.
Everyone can now experience the joys of gardening. Tire containers are safe, sturdy and flexible. They can be held onto, leaned against or bumped into without injury to you or the container.
They can be modified to accommodate anyone with poor balance, limited ability to bend over, stoop or reach; wheelchair confined; or even blind.
Children and even the mentally challenged can enjoy gardening. The therapeutic value of making and painting one's own containers is priceless.
