An Examination of Chronological Aspects of ‘The 5th-Century Invasions According to Tóth Gyula’
Trevor Palmer
Introduction
SIS members are indebted to Patrick Giles for drawing attention (in C&C Review 2018:3 pp. 17-22) to the theory of Tóth Gyula, which maintains that there are serious problems with the conventional view of the chronology of the fifth-century AD. All new challenges to the conventional chronology need to be given serious attention. From a comparison of the conventional chronology of that period with what was said in the Chronicon Pictum, a lavishly-illustrated account of Hungarian history written during the Late Medieval Period, Gyula came to the conclusion that, confused by the switch from the Julian to the Gregorian Calendar after the Chronicon Pictum was written, modern scholars created a chronology for the 5th-century in which a period of around 25 years, beginning with a barbarian invasion of Gaul from across the Rhine and ending with a prominent person
establishing his power, was duplicated, with analogous events being separated by around 44 years. To be
specific, according to Gyula’s theory, the period conventionally dated to AD 407-433, starting with German
tribes crossing the Rhine to invade Gaul and ending with Aëtius regaining power after having been challenged by Bonifacius, was analogous to the period conventionally dated to AD 451-476, starting with Attila leading the Huns across the Rhine to invade Gaul and ending with Odoacer seizing power after killing Orestes. Prominent amongst the analogous events within these periods were the supposed sack of Rome by Alaric and the Goths in AD 410 and the supposed sack of Rome by Gaiseric and the Vandals in AD 455.
Gyula correctly pointed out the absence of a detailed contemporary history of the 5th-century. Zosimus might have provided one, in his New History, written at the beginning of the 6th-century, for the surviving version gives much valuable information about the period conventionally dated to AD 395-410, but it ended abruptly at a point before Alaric had sacked Rome and, in any case, it provided no information which could be used to date events, other than occasional references to the consuls appointed for the year. Cassiodorus, a contemporary of Zosimus, wrote a major history of the Goths, but this has only survived in the form of the Getica by Jordanes, an abridgement blended with other material. As it is sometimes uncertain whether Jordanes was conveying historical details from the work by Cassiodorus, or some folk tales he found interesting, the Getica is of uncertain value and, again, it dated events only by occasional references to consuls. Priscus, who went on a diplomatic mission to the court of Attila the Hun, also wrote a substantial history of the period, but only a few fragments have survived, preserved in other sources, and these provide no information at all about dates. So, Gyula envisaged a process in which later scholars struggled to piece together a coherent account of the history of this period (and others) from documents (often incomplete) found in different regions, written from different perspectives in different languages and using different dating systems – a process made even more hazardous after 1582, when the Gregorian Calendar began to replace the Julian Calendar, Hence, the splitting of a single
period into two or more, beginning at different times, would be quite understandable. So, in this context, the
details of Gyula’s theory reported in Giles’ article seem quite plausible.
However, readers who have been SIS members for many years will no doubt recall that, during the 1990s, many new theories of chronology were published or reported in C&C Review, all of which seemed plausible on the basis of the valid evidence and arguments presented, yet, since they often contradicted each other, they couldn’t all be correct. It soon became apparent that even the most plausible of theories could be undermined by the bringing forward of new evidence (see C&C Review 2018:3, pp. 35-39). Obviously, there is no general rule saying that plausible arguments will always be invalidated when additional information is presented, but every
theory should be tested against all the available evidence and, in the case of Gyula’s theory, it seems that one
particularly significant type of evidence still needs to be brought into consideration. In the article by Giles, it was noted that surviving sources covering the period under consideration include the chronicles by Prosper of Aquitaine, Hydatius and Marcellinus Comes. These all give brief entries on a year-by-year basis, which, from the specific viewpoint of chronology, can be more useful than more-detailed general historical accounts, yet there is no indication in the article of what these, and other similar chronicles, actually said. Let us now, in the first instance, let them speak for themselves. Below are summaries of relevant entries in each of these chronicles over a period of almost 50 years, ending in each case with the sack of Rome by Gaiseric and the Vandals.
The Chronicle of Prosper of Aquitaine
First, let us look at the chronicle of Prosper of Aquitaine, a Frenchman who spent most of his adult life in Rome, during the 5th-century AD. Prosper dated each annual entry in his chronicle by giving the names of the consuls appointed for the year and also to a system of his own devising, the Anno Passione (AP) system, dating events from the supposed year of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Since individual consular dates are only meaningful for chronological purposes if placed within the context of a full reference-list of consular years, AP dates alone



will be given here. In his chronicle, Prosper wrote that, at the end of AP 379, Vandals and Alans crossed the Rhine from the east and entered Gaul. In the following year, Constantine arose in Britain as a usurper to the throne of the western emperor, Honorius, and then crossed into Gaul. In AP 382, a year after the death of the eastern emperor, Arcadius (the brother of Honorius), the Vandals continued their journey west through Gaul and entered Spain. A year later, Alaric, king of a tribe of Goths in south-eastern Europe, captured the city of Rome. In AP 384, Constantine the usurper was taken prisoner in Gaul by Constantius, the military commander of Emperor Honorius. In the following year, the Goths, now under King Athaulf, left Italy and entered Gaul. A year later, Jovinus and Sebastian seized power in Gaul, but were soon killed. In AP 388, Athaulf died and Wallia succeeded him as king of the Goths. In the following year, during which Zosimus succeeded Innocent as the pope in Rome, Wallia, seeking peace with Honorius, released the emperor’s sister, Placidia (who had been captured by the Goths), and she married Constantius. In AP 392, Boniface became pope after the death of Zosimus and, in Gaul, Constantius granted Wallia some territory in Aquitaine. Constantius died two years later. In AP 396, Celestine succeeded Boniface as pope and, in the same year, Emperor Honorius died [1].
A year later, Theodosius II, the eastern emperor, made Valentinian III, the young son of Placidia and Constantius, emperor in the west, with his mother as regent. In AP 398, the Goths attacked Arles, but were driven away by the Roman general, Aëtius. Two years later, a civil war broke out between Felix, the Roman military commander, and Bonifacius, the governor of Roman Africa. Soon afterwards, the Vandal people crossed from Spain to Africa. Felix was promoted to patrician in AP 402, with Aëtius replacing him as military commander, but he murdered Felix a year later when he was told that he was plotting against him. In AP 405, the year when Pope Celestine died and was succeeded by Sixtus, Bonifacius was appointed military commander and Aëtius demoted, resulting in armed conflict between the two of them. Bonifacius won a military victory, causing Aëtius to flee through Dalmatia and Pannonia to seek the help of the Huns, but Bonifacius died soon after the battle. Aëtius was then able to re-establish peace with Emperor Valentinian and his mother, resulting in him being restored to the position of military commander. In AP 408, the Romans made a pact with the Vandals and granted them territory in Africa. At around the same time, Aëtius defeated the Burgundians, who had settled in Gaul, but then granted them peace. In AP 413, Pope Sixtus died and Leo was appointed as his successor. In the same year, Gaiseric the Vandal caused great havoc in Sicily but, two years later, Valentinian, the western emperor, agreed a treaty with him, at a time when the Huns were laying waste Thrace and Illyrica. In AP 417, Attila killed his brother and became undisputed ruler of the Huns. In AP 423, Theodosius II died and was succeeded as eastern emperor by Marcian. A year later, in AP 424, Attila led the Huns across the Rhine and into Gaul, but was defeated by Aëtius in alliance with the Goths. Attila returned east and entered northern Italy in the following year but, with his army suffering from pestilence and famine, he returned home after receiving a
delegation led by Pope Leo, and died a year later. In AP 427, a dispute between Aëtius and Emperor Valentinian
resulted in the former being murdered in the palace in Ravenna by some of Valentinian’s men. Valentinian
himself was assassinated in Rome soon afterwards, in AP 428, giving Maximus, a former consul, the
opportunity to proclaim himself western emperor and force Valentinian’s widow to marry him. The Roman
people rose up against Maximus and murdered him. In the ensuing confusion, Gaiseric the Vandal entered Rome and seized much booty before leaving with Valentinian’s widow and her daughters [2].
The Chronicle of Hydatius
Let us now turn to the chronicle of Hydatius, written in Spain by a bishop who was a contemporary of Prosper. This work was explicitly a continuation of the Eusebius-Jerome chronicle and used the same dating systems, i.e. one which had been employed by Diodorus Siculus, based on the sequence of Olympiads at four-yearly intervals, and another devised by Eusebius himself, dating events from the supposed birth of Abraham. As well as these, Hydatius dated each year in his chronicle according to the long-lasting Spanish Era system, employed for almost 1,000 years to date chronicles and histories written in Spain, eventually being used in association with the AD system. So, for example, the Chronicle of Alfonso XI dated the death of this king to Era 1388 and AD 1350. Here, we’ll simply note the Spanish Era dates given by Hydatius to some events relevant to our examination.
Hydatius wrote that, in Era 447, Vandals, Alans and Sueves entered Spain and, in the same year, Alaric the king of the Goths sacked Rome and left with Placidia, the sister of Honorius, the western emperor. Alaric died shortly afterward and Athaulf succeeded him as king. Two years later, as the Vandals, Alans and Sueves took control of different parts of Spain, Constantine, after a 3-year usurpation, was killed in Gaul by Honorius’ military commander, Constantius. Two years after that, in Era 451, a rebellion by Jovinus and Sebastian was crushed by the Romans at Narbonne and, shortly afterwards, the Goths arrived in the same region. In Era 454, Constantius forced the Goths to move towards Spain, where Athaulf was killed and Wallia succeeded him as king. Wallia made peace with Constantius and then attacked the Alans and the Vandals in Spain, whilst Constantius married Placidia. The Goths inflicted heavy losses on the Alans and Vandals, in the name of Rome, over the next two years, but Constantius then recalled Wallia to Gaul and gave the Goths settlements in Aquitaine. Theoderic



succeeded Wallia as king soon afterwards. In Era 458, in Ravenna, Constantius was raised to the status of junior emperor, becoming Constantius III, but he died a year later. Three years after that, in Era 462, Emperor Honorius died in Ravenna [3].
In the following year, Era 463, Valentinian, the son of Constantius and Placidia, having been sent to Italy by Theodosius II, the eastern emperor, was proclaimed western emperor. After further fighting between the barbarian tribes in Spain, Gaiseric, king of the Vandals, crossed with his entire tribe to Africa in Era 467. A year later, a band of Goths were wiped out by Aëtius, the Roman military commander, near Arles. In the following year, after the patrician, Felix, had been killed in a mutiny in Ravenna, Aëtius subjugated the rebel Nori tribe, and later defeated the Franks in a battle. When the Sueves broke a treaty in Spain, Hydatius reported that he personally took part in a mission to draw this to the attention of Aëtius, and, in Era 470, he returned home, accompanied by the commander’s envoy. In the same year, Bonifacius was recalled from Africa by Placidia to counter the growing strength of Aëtius, and he was appointed military commander in place of his rival, but died soon afterwards following a battle against Aëtius. His son-in-law, Sebastianus, replaced him, but Sebastianus was soon defeated and driven away by Aëtius. Two years later, in Era 472, Sebastianus sought refuge in Constantinople whilst, in the same year, in Rome, Sixtus became pope, following Celestine. In Era 477, Gaiseric the Vandal, whose power in Africa had been growing, seized control of Carthage whilst, in Europe, there was war between the Romans and the Goths, but peace was eventually re-established. Gaiseric went on to pillage Sicily in the following year. In Era 482, Sebastianus, having been warned that his life was in danger, left Constantinople to seek protection from Theoderic, king of the Goths, but was declared an outlaw. Sebastianus escaped to Barcelona and then, in the following year, he made his way to join the Vandals. Two years after that, in Era 485, Leo succeeded Sixtus as pope. Four years later, in Era 489, Emperor Theodosius II died in Constantinople, his successor being Marcian, who went on to marry Pulcheria, the sister of Theodosius, whilst, in the subsequent year, Empress Placidia, the aunt of Pulcheria and mother of Emperor Valentinian, died in Rome. In that same year, Era 490, Attila led the Huns into Gaul, but they were defeated by the combined armies of Aëtius and Theoderic, although the king of the Goths died in the battle. Attila retreated into Italy, where, in the following year, his army, suffering from the effects of famine and disease, offered little effective resistance to the armies of Aëtius and Marcian. Attila returned home and died soon afterwards. In Era 492, at the instigation of Valentinian, the western emperor, Aëtius was murdered in the imperial palace. However, in the following year, Era 493, Valentinian was himself assassinated in the Campus Martius in Rome. Maximus, an ex-consul, was proclaimed western emperor in his place, and he forced Valentinian’s widow to marry him, but
his actions alienated the Roman people and he was killed during the subsequent riots. Gaiseric the Vandal then
entered Rome and, after sacking the city, he returned to Carthage, taking with him Valentinian’s widow and her
two daughters [4].
The Chronicle of Marcellinus Comes
For a perspective from Constantinople on these events, let us now turn to the chronicle of Marcellinus Comes. In this work, written early in the 6th-century AD, Marcellinus headed each annual entry with the names of the consuls for the year and its place in the 15-year indiction cycle. In isolation, the names of the consuls mean
little, so here we’ll just indicate the timescale evident from the sequence of annual entries from a relevant
starting point, the consulship of Bassus & Philippus, indiction 6. In this year, according to Marcellinus, Arcadius, the eastern emperor, died, and Stilicho, whose two daughters were both wives of the western emperor, Honorius (the brother of Arcadius), was executed for plotting with the Vandals, Alans and Sueves. Two years later, Alaric, the king of the Goths, plundered Rome during the papacy of Innocent and then departed, taking with him Placidia, the sister of Honorius. In the following year, Constantine usurped power in Gaul, but was killed. A year later, Jovinus and Sebastian were similarly killed in Gaul, plotting a usurpation. Six years after the consulship of Bassus & Philippus, Wallia, king of the Goths, made peace with the Romans and freed Placidia. Nine years after that same consulship, Zosimus succeeded Pope Innocent and, three years later, Boniface became pope. Fifteen years after the consulship of Bassus & Philippus, Celestine succeeded Pope Boniface and, in the same year, Emperor Honorius died [5].
In the following year, Placidia was proclaimed empress with her 5-year-old son, Valentinian III, as junior emperor. At the same time, Valentinian was betrothed to Eudoxia, the 2-year-old daughter of Emperor Theodosius II (the son of Arcadius). A year later, 17 years after the consulship of Bassus & Philippus, Valentinian was made western emperor in Ravenna. Then, after a sequence of entries concerned largely with events in Constantinople, but noting the murder of Felix in Ravenna, Marcellinus reported that, 24 years after the consulship of Bassus & Philippus, Sixtus was ordained pope in Rome and, in the same year, at the instigation of Placidia, a great battle took place between Bonifacius and Aëtius, which resulted in Bonifacius subsequently dying from his wounds. Three years after that, 27 years after the consulship of Bassus & Philippus, Sebastianus, the son-in-law of Bonifacius, fled from Rome and was killed in Africa. Two years later, Emperor Valentinian and Eudoxia were married in Constantinople. Then, 31 years after the consulship of Bassus &



Philippus, Gaiseric, king of the Vandals, occupied the major cities of Africa, including Carthage, and, in the following year, Leo became pope, following the death of Sixtus. Over the next few years, the Huns ravaged Illyricum and Thrace and, 37 years after the consulship of Bassus & Philippus, Attila became king over all the Huns after murdering his brother. Two years later, Attila instigated a mighty war, and, three years after that (42 years after the consulship of Bassus & Philippus), Emperor Theodosius died and was succeeded as eastern emperor by Marcian. Then, 46 years after the consulship of Bassus & Philippus, Attila the Hun, who had ravaged the province of Europe, was murdered by his wife. In the same year, Aëtius, described by Marcellinus as the main salvation of the western empire and the scourge of Attila, was murdered by the western emperor, Valentinian. In the following year, 47 years after the consulship of Bassus & Philippus, Valentinian was cut down in the Campus Martius in Rome by friends of Aëtius. Maximus then usurped power but, three months later, he was murdered by an angry mob of Romans. Gaiseric and the Vandals then entered Rome from Africa. After sacking the city, they departed with their booty, and also with Valentinian’s widow, Eudoxia, and her two daughters [6].
Conclusions arising from the three 5th/6th-century Chronicles
In these summaries of relevant details given in three 5th/6th-century chronicles, two of them recording very recent happenings (Hydatius actually mentioning his own minor involvement in one of them) and the third written less than a century later, it is clearly evident they were all describing the very sequence of events which, according to Gyula, had never occurred, having been falsely constructed as a result of misunderstandings following the creation of the Gregorian calendar in AD 1582. Furthermore, these three chronicles were not alone in presenting this historical sequence. Amongst others, for example, was the chronicle of Cassiodorus, compiled in Italy at around the same time that Marcellinus Comes was writing in Constantinople, and, like him, using the consular dating system. Most of the period was also covered by the first Gallic Chronicle, which used the same dating systems as the chronicle of Hydatius, apart from the Spanish Era system, and described a very similar sequence of events [7].
So, what about the apparent repetitions of historical events at approximately 44-year intervals, summarised in Table I of the article by Giles? Unfortunately, some of these are based on misunderstandings. For example, in noting apparent parallels between Alaric and Attila, Table I has Alaric coming into Gaul three years before his sack of Rome and again two years after the sack of the city, but there is no indication in any source that Alaric ever set foot in Gaul, or that he lived for more than a few months after entering Rome. Also, several other supposed repetitions, such as a pope and a minor emperor with different names (Boniface and Libius Severus, respectively) both being in office for about 4 years, seem rather low in discriminatory value. Even in the remaining examples, what may seem at first glance like a plausible case of a repetition of the same event can look rather different when considered in more detail. That is certainly true in what is perhaps the most significant example of all: the sack of the city of Rome.
All the information presented in the 5th- and 6th-century chronicles is consistent with Alaric and the Goths, having approached from the northeast, sacking Rome in the middle of the reign of Honorius, the western emperor, soon after the start of the reign of Theodosius II, the eastern emperor, and during the papacy of Innocent I. On their departure, they took with them Galla Placidia, the sister of Honorius. In contrast, Gaiseric and the Vandals, said by the sources to have approached from the south, sacked Rome soon after the murder of the western emperor, Valentinian III, son of Galla Placidia, and then the slaying of his short-lived successor, Maximus, during the reign of Marcian as eastern emperor and the papacy of Leo I. Gaiseric then left Rome
accompanied by Valentinian’s widow and her two daughters, one of whom, Eudocia, was to marry Gaiseric’s
eldest son, Huneric, in line with a previous agreement with Emperor Valentinian. Prosper dated the sack of Rome by Alaric to AP 383, when Varanes was consul, and the sack of Rome by Gaiseric to AP 428, the consular year of Emperor Valentinian & Anthemius. Marcellinus Comes and Cassiodorus both similarly dated the sack by the Goths to the consulship of Varanes and that by the Vandals to the consulship of Valentinian & Anthemius. Hydatius dated the sack of Rome by Alaric to Spanish Era 447, Era of Abraham 2427 and Olympiad 297:2 (i.e. the 2nd year of the 297th Olympiad) and the sack of the city by Gaiseric to Spanish Era 493, Era of Abraham 2472 and Olympiad 308:4 [8]. Without question, the compilers of these 5th- and 6th-century chronicles saw the sack of Rome by the Goths and that by the Vandals as two separate events, taking place at different times, the numerical dating systems indicating a separation of 45 years, to within a year. Different consular dates were also given for the two events.
Linkages between Dating Systems used in 5th-7th-Century Historical Sources
Just how different were the consular dates given by the sources for the sacks of the city by Goths and Vandals, in terms of years? In his article, Giles suggested that modern scholars have allocated numerical dates to consulships on the basis of dubious assumptions, but, as has already been pointed out, the timescale in chronicles with annual entries, each headed by the names of the consuls for the year, can be determined without



making any assumptions at all, other than that the annual entries have been presented in a linear sequence. The indiction years given in some of them (including that of Marcellinus) are entirely consistent with the entries having been presented in this way. Examining the sources, we see that the consulship of Varanes alone, when the sack of Rome by the Goths was said to have taken place, is consistently placed 45 years earlier that the consulship of Valentinian III & Anthemius, when the Vandals were said to have sacked the city. And that is only part of the story. As also noted, in some of the chronicles (particularly that by Prosper), consular years were linked to dates in a numerical system, and, in addition, it is apparent that the chroniclers were familiar with several dating systems. They may not have had the technological advantages available to us, but they had essentially the same genes, so had a similar capacity to copy with complex situations. Throughout the period of the Late Roman Republic and the Early Roman Empire, two major dating systems had operated side-by-side: Olympiad dating, favoured by Greek historians; and consular dating, favoured by Romans. The influential chronicle of Eusebius, written in Greek, employed Olympiad dating, linked to regnal-year and Era of Abraham dating and, after the death of Eusebius, its continuation, written in Latin by Jerome, did the same, but, at its very end, Jerome brought the two main systems together, dating the death of Emperor Valens in Olympiad 289:3 and Era of Abraham 2395 to the consulship of Valens (for the 6th time) & Valentinian II (for the 2nd). As was stated explicitly, the chronicle of Marcellinus Comes and the chronicle of Hydatius, were each designed to follow on from the Eusebius-Jerome chronicle, as was the first Gallic Chronicle. All made use of regnal-year dating but, in addition, Marcellinus used consular dating; the Gallic Chronicle employed Olympiad and Era of Abraham dating; and Hydatius, writing in Spain, used Spanish Era dating as well as Olympiad and Era of Abraham dating, making clear its relationship with the other systems. The common starting point of these chronicles was the year following the death of Emperor Valens in the consulship of Valens (his 6th) & Valentinian II (his 2nd), which was also Spanish Era 416, as well as Olympiad 289:3 and Era of Abraham 2395, as mentioned above.
Another key source for this period was the chronicle of Prosper, which, as we have seen, dated each year
according the consuls appointed for it and also Prosper’s own AP system, with the key consulship during which
Valens died being linked to AP 351 [9].
From this consulship to that of Valentinian III (his 8th) & Anthemius, which was the last entry in Prosper’s chronicle, the chronicles of Prosper, Marcellinus Comes and Cassiodorus, as well as the 5th-century Consularia Constantinopolitana and the 7th-century Chronicon Paschale, all gave 77 annual entries with very similar details
for the succession of consulships, as well as links to other dating systems. So, for example, Prosper’s entry for
the consulship of Bassus & Philippus associated this consulship with AP 381, whilst his entry for the consulship of Theodosius II (his 14th) & Maximus linked this year to both AP 406 and Era of Abraham 2450. Similarly, the Consularia Constantinopolitana (compiled in Spain, despite the title by which it is known) associated the consulship of Bassus & Philippus with Spanish Era 446 [10]. Also, as we have noted, the Hydatius chronicle, throughout, dated events according to each of the Olympiad, Spanish Era and Era of Abraham systems, and, in addition, sometimes recorded the names of the consuls. Thus, on the basis of consistent linkages between dating systems in these various chronicles, a date in any one system can be converted to a date in any of the others, without having to make any assumptions. So, for example, the consulship of Bassus & Philippus, which we have used as a reference point in the chronicle of Marcellinus Comes, can unambiguously be dated to AP 381 and Spanish Era 446.
Events in the Historical Sources during the Four Decades after the Reign of Marcian
We shall return to the subject of linkages between dating systems, but first we need to extend the period of our
investigation, because we have yet to find in the 5th/6th-century sources any mention of some of the possible
“duplicates” indicated in Table I of the article by Giles. So far we have only looked at what these sources said
about events in the period from around the time the death of the western emperor, Arcadius, through the reign of his son and successor, Theodosius II and into the reign of the next eastern emperor, Marcian, so we now need to continue our investigation to see what the sources, particularly chronicles giving year-by-year accounts, said of events beyond the reign of Marcian, particularly relating to Avitus, Majorian, Theoderic II (a Visigoth king), Libius Severus, Nepos, Orestes, Romulus Augustulus and Odoacer, all mentioned in the lower lines of the suggested “analogue-pairs” in Table I. Of the three chronicles we used as our principal sources, we have not reached the half-way point of that by Marcellinus Comes, so we shall continue to use it as before. The chronicle by Hydatius also went on to record events beyond the reign of Marcian, although only for another decade, but we shall continue to use it while we can. Our third major source, the chronicle by Prosper, ended at exactly the point we have reached, but two 6th-century chronicles, those by Marius of Avenches, written in Gaul, and Victor
of Tunnena, written in Constantinople, were explicitly presented as continuations of Prosper’s chronicle,
similarly beginning the account for each year with the names of the consuls associated with it, although, unlike Prosper, not with the corresponding AP date. Of the other chronicles we have referred to, the first Gallic Chronicle came to an end before that of Prosper, and although there was a second Gallic Chronicle, this was sketchy and relied solely on regnal-year dating, so is of limited value to us. However, the chronicle of



Cassiodorus and the 7th-century Chronicon Paschale remain as sources which cover the period we are now considering. Thus we have five chronicles giving consular-dated annual entries for several decades after the end
of Prosper’s chronicle [11].
As with the previous period, there are some minor differences in the consular sequences provided in the various sources, but these largely involve the precise details of the names of individual consuls, and the discrepancies are no more than would be expected when people were writing independent historical accounts in scattered locations without access to a common data-base. Furthermore, the Chronicon Paschale, retaining the spirit and most of the details of the final entry in the Eusebius-Jerome chronicle, incorporated regnal-year and Olympiad dates, plus, on occasions, years in an Anno Mundi (AM) system, as well as the names of the consuls for each of the annual entries. Another 7th-century chronicle was that by Isidore of Seville, where the entries were sequences of reigns rather than sequences of years, breaks between them being dated according to a different AM system. Isidore also wrote a brief History of the Goths, dating events by the Spanish Era system. Another history of the Goths was provided in the 6th-century by Jordanes in his Getica but, as mentioned above, this seems to be an uneasy blend of history and fanciful stories. Nevertheless, with that caveat, a few relevant points from the Getica will be mentioned below, amongst details from more conventional historical sources
According to 5th- and 6th-century historical sources, Hunnic power collapsed rapidly after the death of Attila, and the barbarian tribes in the Danube region who had been subject to the Huns began to battle against each other for territory. Rather than compete in this struggle, the Goths still living in this region (who are known to us as the Ostrogoths, i.e. eastern Goths, whereas we call the ones who had moved to live in southwestern Gaul or Spain the Visigoths, i.e. western Goths) approached Marcian, the eastern emperor, for a treaty, and were eventually granted a homeland in Pannonia, south of the Danube. As a hostage for the maintenance of peace, Theodoric, the 7-year-old nephew of Valamir, the Ostrogoth king, was sent to Constantinople, arriving after Leo I had succeeded Marcian as eastern emperor [12].
In the west, as reported by Hydatius and other sources, news of the death of Emperor Maximus reached Gaul when his military commander, Avitus, a Gallo-Roman aristocrat, was visiting the Visigoths, and Avitus was immediately acclaimed in Toulouse as the new emperor by the Visigoth king, Theoderic II. As Avitus marched towards Rome accompanied by Theoderic and the Visigoth army, he was also acclaimed emperor in Arles. When he reached Rome and was acknowledged as the western emperor, he promised to seek harmony with the eastern emperor, Marcian. Hydatius, Cassiodorus, Marius and Victor all said that Avitus became emperor in the same year when Maximus was killed and the Vandals sacked Rome which, as we have noted, can be dated to Spanish Era 493, AP 428 and the consulship of Valentinian III & Anthemius (47 years after the consulship of Bassus & Philippus). Soon after becoming emperor, Avitus sanctioned a major assault by his ally, Theoderic II, on the Sueves in Spain, which proved to be far less straightforward than expected, leaving Avitus without significant military support when the Roman elite rebelled against him. His principal opponent was Majorian, a Roman aristocrat, strongly supported by the wily Ricimer, who, since he was of barbarian descent, could never aspire to be emperor, but began to see himself as the power-behind-the-throne. According to Cassiodorus, Marius and Victor, Avitus was deposed during the consulship of Varanes & John (48 years after Bassus & Philippus). However, Hydatius indicated that Avitus continued to be recognised in Spain as western emperor until his death in the third year of his reign, noting that Emperor Marcian died in the same year. Marcellinus, Cassiodorus, Victor and the Chronicon Paschale all said that Leo succeeded Marcian as eastern emperor in the consular year of Constantine & Rufus (49 years after Bassus & Philippus) [13].
When it became clear that Majorian had the support of Emperor Leo, he was formally declared western emperor. Majorian then led an army west into Spain, and, having demonstrated his strength, formed an alliance with Theodoric II. His position as emperor seemed secure, but he then embarked on a disastrous naval campaign against the Vandals. When he returned to Italy, he was taken prisoner by Ricimer and subsequently executed, with an elderly senator, Libius Severus, being appointed emperor in his place. According to Hydatius, this was in Era 499. Marcellinus, Cassiodorus and Marius dated it to the consulship of Severinus & Dagalaiphus (53 years after Bassus & Philippus), but Victor placed it two years later. As reported by Marcellinus, Hilarus succeeded Leo as pope during the year in which Majorian died, whereas Hydatius dated this transition to the 2nd year of Severus, going on to say that this emperor died two years later. Cassiodorus and Marcellinus dated the death of Severus to the consulship of Basiliscus & Armenericus (57 years after Bassus & Philippus) [14].
Emperor Leo then decided to intervene to try to restore some order in the west, sending the patrician Anthemius, son-in-law of Marcian, to be the next western emperor. Hydatius indicated that Anthemius travelled to Italy with a strong army in Era 503. Marcellinus, Cassiodorus, Marius, Victor and the Chronicon Paschale all wrote that Anthemius became western emperor during the consulship of Pusaeus & John (59 years after Bassus & Philippus). Marcellinus noted that, in this same consular year, Simplicius succeeded Hilarus as pope in Rome, and Hydatius dated this transition to Era 505, noting also that, in this same year, Euric murdered his brother, Theoderic II, and became king of the Visigoths. Isidore of Seville dated the accession of Euric to the previous



year, Era 504, adding that it was the 8th year of Emperor Leo. Victor dated the accession of Euric to the 3rd consulship of Emperor Leo (58 years after Bassus & Philippus), whereas Marius gave it as the following consular year, when Anthemius also acceded to the throne. Soon after becoming western emperor, Anthemius joined with Leo in a major operation against the Vandals, which began well but then fell apart. Afterwards, Anthemius tried to subdue the Visigoths, who, under Euric, were gaining territory in both Gaul and Spain. At the instigation of Anthemius, the Bretons attacked the Visigoths in Gaul, but were defeated. The western emperor then sent an army to take direct action against the Visigoths, but that too was defeated, making Anthemius increasingly unpopular in Italy. This gave Ricimer the opportunity to fight against him in a civil war, which resulted in the defeat and death of Anthemius. Ricimer then appointed Olybrius, son-in-law of Valentinian III, as western emperor, but both Ricimer and Olybrius died within a few months. After a period of confusion, Glycerius, who had been an officer of Olybrius, was placed upon the throne. Marcellinus and Cassiodorus dated the deaths of both Anthemius and Olybrius to the consulship of Marcianus & Festus (64 years after Bassus & Philippus) and, according to these two sources and also Marius, Glycerius became western emperor in the following year [15].
In Constantinople, the Chronicon Paschale reported that Emperor Leo died during his 5th consulship, when he was the only consul (65 years after Bassus & Philippus)), and was succeeded by young Leo II, whose mother was the daughter of Leo I. Zeno, the father of Leo II, was then appointed co-emperor. Leo II died in the following year, leaving Zeno as sole emperor. According to Marcellinus, Cassiodorus and Victor, the death of Leo I and the accession of Zeno both occurred in the year when Leo junior was the only consul (66 years after Bassus & Philippus). Zeno swiftly deposed the western emperor, Glycerius, replacing him with Julius Nepos. However, not long afterwards, Nepos was deposed by his own military commander, Orestes, and fled to Dalmatia, where he was murdered in his villa near Salona five years later. Meanwhile, Orestes had raised up his own son, Romulus Augustulus, to succeed Nepos, but Orestes was soon killed by Odoacer, leader of a confederation of German tribes living in northern Italy. Odoacer then sent Augustulus, the last western emperor, into exile and established himself as king of Italy. According to Marcellinus, Cassiodorus and Marius, that was during the consulship of Basiliscus & Armatus (68 years after Bassus & Philippus) [16].
We have now reached the last of the key events, the seizing of power by Odoacer, but, as a postscript to this section, let us note that, according to Jordanes, Theodoric, the boy who had been held as a hostage for peace by Emperor Leo, became king of the Ostrogoths after the deaths of his uncle and his father, but he remained on good terms with the Romans and served as term as consul during the reign of Emperor Zeno. Marcellinus, Cassiodorus, Victor and the Chronicon Paschale all recorded the consulship of Theodoric (with Venantius) 76 years after that of Bassus & Philippus. Later, with the support of Zeno, Theodoric led the Ostrogoths into Italy, to challenge Odoacer for his kingdom. Marcellinus, Cassiodorus and Marius noted that Theodoric entered Italy during the consulship of Eusebius & Probinus (81 years after Bassus & Philippus), whereas Victor dated this event to the next consular year. All said that Theodoric defeated and killed Odoacer soon afterwards, Cassiodorus, Marius and Victor dating the death of Odoacer to the 85th consular year after that of Bassus & Philippus [17].
So, what can we conclude about the proposed “analogue-pairs” listed in Table I of the article by Giles, now that,
in this section, all the remaining members have been located in 5th-7th-century chronicles and histories? It is surely undeniable that, for these proposed pairs, Avitus/Jovinus, Majorian/Constantius, Theoderic II/Wallia, Emperor Severus/Pope Boniface, Nepos/Aëtius, Orestes/Bonifacius, Augustulus/Sebastianus and Odoacer/Aëtius, the sources we have examined consistently place the first member of each pair in a later historical context than the second member.
Timescales between Events in the Historical Sources
As mentioned in the Introduction, Gyula’s view was that modern and relatively-modern scholars, from Scaliger onwards, when trying to piece together the history of the transition from Late Roman to Early Medieval Europe, on the basis of surviving documents from this period and shortly afterwards, found only a chaotic mess to work from. As well as other problems, documents from different regions often used different languages and different dating systems. Because of this, and further confusion resulting from the switch from the Julian to the Gregorian Calendar, two different accounts of the same 25-year period were incorporated sequentially into what became the conventional history of the 5th-century.
We have already encountered a number of histories and chronicles which covered the relevant period (all originally written during the 5th-7th-centuries in either Latin or Greek, the languages of scholarship in the west and east, respectively). Let us now examine them (and others) in a more systematic fashion, to see to what extent the chronological information they present is chaotic or confusing. Since, in conventional history, the earliest event mentioned in Table I in the article by Giles is the invasion of Gaul by German tribes from across the Rhine, supposedly in AD 407, whilst the latest is the seizing of power by Odoacer, supposedly in AD 476,



and, as we have seen, in the chronicles, the first of these events was consistently placed within the reign of Honorius and the second within the reign of Zeno, let us in the first instance focus on the timescale from the accession of Honorius (who became western emperor when his brother Arcadius became eastern emperor) to that of Zeno, given in a wide range of sources.
Marcellinus and Cassiodorus both dated the accession of Honorius to the consulship of Olybrius & Probinus, and that of Zeno 79 years later in the consulship of Leo II alone. The Chronicon Paschale agreed with Marcellinus and Cassiodorus about the consular year in which Zeno became emperor, but extended the timescale from Honorius by one year by placing the accession of the latter in the consular year preceding that of Olybrius & Probinus. Prosper, like Marcellus and Cassiodorus, dated the accession of Honorius to the consulship of Olybrius & Probinus and, although his chronicle ended before the reign of Zeno, its continuation by Victor dated the accession of Zeno to the sole consulship of Leo II, as did the other sources [18]. Thus there is overall agreement, to within a year.
The Chronicon Paschale also dated the accession of Honorius to Olympiad 293:3 and that of Zeno to Olympiad 313:3, indicating a timescale of 80 years. In addition, this source gave AM dates, as did Isidore in Spain, Bede in England and Theophanes in Constantinople, all using different AM systems. According to the Chronicon Paschale, the period from the accession of Honorius to that of Zeno was AM 5903-5983 (a timescale of 80 years); Isidore, in his chronicle, gave it as AM 5593-5670 (77 years); Bede as AM 4349-4427 (78 years); and Theophanes AM 5886-5966 (80 years). Isidore, in his History of the Goths, indicated that the period from the accession of Honorius to that of Zeno was Spanish Era 433-511 (78 years) [19].
There seems little here that could cause any significant confusion, with the sources, regardless of the dating system being used, giving a timescale of 77-80 years for the same period, so let us now turn our attention to the timescale between the first and last events mentioned in Giles’ Table I. As we have noted, the conventional
timescale between the crossing of the Rhine by the German tribes (in AD 407) and the seizing of power by
Odoacer (in AD 476) is 69 years, whereas, according to Gyula’s theory, this act by Odoacer was analogous to
the similar act in AD 433 attributed to Aëtius, so, in reality, it took place only 26 years after the invasion by the German tribes. So, what did the 5th-7th-century chroniclers say? The chronicle of Cassiodorus noted the crossing of the Rhine by the German tribes during the consulship of Arcadius (his 6th) & Probus, and then, 70 years later, Odoacer seizing power during the consulship of Basiliscus & Armatus. That is consistent with the conventional
view rather than Gyula’s theory, and it’s the norm rather than the exception. Prosper similarly recorded the
crossing of the Rhine by the German tribes during the consulship of Arcadius (his 6th) & Probus, and then, when we come, via the linkage with the chronicle of Marius, to the 70th consulship after this event, that of Basiliscus & Armatus, we again find a note of Odoacer being raised up as king. Marcellinus made no mention of the crossing of the Rhine by the German tribes but, in the consulship of Bassus & Philippus in indiction 6, two years after the consulship of Arcadius & Probus in indiction 4, he noted the deaths of Count Stilicho and Emperor Arcadius, and then, 68 years later, he too recorded the rise to power of Odoacer during the consulship of Basiliscus & Armatus in indiction 14. There is no mention of Odoacer in any chronicle before this consulship [20].
So, it is clear that the 5th-7th-century chronicles present a consistent picture of the timescale between events which occurred during the 5th-century (including those included in Table I), but none of these chronicles used the AD dating system. Is there an objective way of allocating AD dates to the events referred to in these chronicles? There is indeed, as we shall see in the next section.
AD Dates
We discussed above how linkages between dating systems used in 5th-7th-century chronicles enable dates in one of the systems to be converted into dates in another, without the involvement of any modern assumptions whatsoever. Dates in the Anno Domini (AD) system, devised in Rome by Dionysius Exiguus for use in Easter Tables, can also be incorporated into this matrix because, right at the start, Dionysius, a contemporary of Cassiodorus, pointed out the links between his dating system and others. Dionysius noted, in a letter to a bishop named Petronius, that he had completed the Easter Tables in the consular year of Probus, indiction 3, which, in the Alexandrian tables currently being used (although nearing their end), corresponded to Era of Diocletian 241, but was AD 525 in the system he had devised for the new tables. His stated intention was to replace a system commemorating a persecutor of Christians (Diocletian) with something more suitable. Because of its use in Easter Tables, the Era of Diocletian was already firmly linked to the commonly-used western dating systems (revealing, for example, a clear association between Era of Diocletian 171, indiction 8, and the consulship of Valentinian III & Anthemius, AP 428, when there was a major dispute about the date of Easter). Hence, that provided a route for incorporating AD dates into the system of linkages. Since Dionysius equated Era of Diocletian 241 with AD 525, it follows that the consulship of Valentinian III & Anthemius, because of its association with Era of Diocletian 171, can be dated to AD 455. Moreover, the information given by Dionysius



also provided another route for linking the AD system to consular dates. According to the chronicle of Marcellinus Comes and its continuation (as well as the Chronicon Paschale), on only one occasion was there a consul named Probus in indiction 3 – that when the other consul was Philoxenus. Hence, the consulship of Probus & Philoxenus can be linked to AD 525. The linkage provided by Prosper between consulships and the AP dating system enables AD dates to be linked to AP dates by an extension of this process, but there were in fact direct linkages between the AD and AP systems. When Dionysius introduced his new Easter Tables to
continue on from the Alexandrian ones, some parts of Western Europe were already using Easter Tables
compiled by Victorius of Aquitaine, with entries dated according to Prosper’s AP system. As known from the
sources, these tables generally gave dates for Easter Sunday in line with ones obtained by the Alexandrian method used by Dionysius, and a comparison of the tables shows that the first 28 years in the Dionysian tables, from AD 532 to AD 559 (inclusive), gave the same sequence of Easter dates as in the entries from AP 505 to AP 532 (inclusive) in the Victorian tables. Hence there are strong reasons for identifying the period from AD 532 to AD 559 as the same as that from AP 505 to AP 532. Indirect links between AD and Spanish Era dates can also be established using the data given above, but, in addition, there are some direct links. So, for example, Julian of Toledo ended one of his books by giving its date of completion as AD 686, Spanish Era 724 [21]. Hence, except in rare cases, AD dates can be assigned to events dated in different systems, using relationships deduced in straightforward fashion from the 5th-7th-century sources themselves. No modern assumptions at all are required.
The various linkages give rise to extremely consistent outcomes, but there are, nevertheless, some minor uncertainties, because of the characteristics of different calendars. For example, the consular year during the period of the Roman Empire ran from January to December, but each new Olympiad began in the summer, and the indiction year ran from September to August. With some calendars, there could be regional variations concerning the date of the New Year, and there could also be some uncertainty about the time-period between the accession of a king and the start of his first regnal year. Hence, when a date was transferred from one system to another, there could be an uncertainty of perhaps a year, but no reason to suppose anything significantly
larger than that. All the dates given by the chronicles for Alaric’s sack of Rome, when converted to the system of Dionysius, give, to within a year, a date of AD 410, and all the dates for Gaiseric’s sack of Rome give, to
within a year, one of AD 455 [22].
Let us look at the process in operation, stressing, once again, that no modern assumptions are involved everything follows from information provided in the historical sources. As noted above, Dionysius linked the year when Probus was consul in indiction 3, which was also Era of Diocletian 241, to AD 525 in the new system
he was introducing. The only consulship in the lists which satisfies the “Probus in indiction 3” criterion is that of
Probus & Philoxenus, so, on this basis, it can be dated to AD 525. Both the chronicle of Marcellinus Comes (with its anonymous continuation) and the Chronicon Paschale place the consulship of Probus & Philoxenus, indiction 3, 49 years later than the consulship of Basiliscus & Armatus, indiction 14, so, if the former consulship is dated to AD 525, the latter can be dated to AD 476. In the chronicle of Marcellinus, written in Constantinople early in the 6th-century, and also the chronicle of Cassiodorus, written in Italy at around the same time, the rise to power of Odoacer was placed in the consulship of Basiliscus & Armatus, as we have just seen, so, on the basis of the linkages, can be dated to AD 476. Prior to that, Marcellinus and Cassiodorus gave a mutually consistent sequence of 70 consulships back to Arcadius & Probus in indiction 6, the consular year when, according to Cassiodorus (and also Prosper), Vandals and Alans crossed the Rhine and invaded Gaul. Hence, on the evidence of these chronicles, if Odoacer rose to power in AD 476, the Vandals and Alans invaded Gaul in AD 406.
Events in between can be dated on the same basis. Here, for example, are some events noted by Marcellinus, preceded, in brackets, by the AD date, determined by the method explained above: (AD 408) Stilicho and Emperor Arcadius died; (AD 410) Alaric and his Goths sacked Rome; (AD 411) Constantine usurped power in Gaul and was killed; (AD 414) Wallia made peace with Rome and freed Placidia; (AD 423) Honorius died and Pope Boniface was succeeded by Celestine; (AD 432) Bonifacius fought a great battle against Aëtius; (AD 439) Gaiseric and Vandals occupied cities of Africa, including Carthage; (AD 440) Leo became pope; (AD 445) Attila killed his brother and became king of the Huns; (AD 450) Marcian succeeded Theodosius II as emperor; (AD 454) Aëtius and Attila were killed; (AD 455) Valentinian and Maximus were killed in Rome and Gaiseric and his Vandals sacked the city; (AD 457) Emperor Marcian was succeeded by Leo; (AD 461) Pope Leo was succeeded by Hilarus; (AD 465) Severus, the western emperor, died in Rome; (AD 467) Emperor Leo sent Anthemius to become western emperor; (AD 474) Emperor Leo was succeeded by Zeno; (AD 475) Nepos, the western emperor, was deposed by Orestes; (AD 476) Odoacer killed Orestes and became king of Italy; (AD 489) Theodoric the Goth invaded Italy to challenge Odoacer.
Of course, the AD dates given above were all dependent on a single linkage, that between AD 525 in the system of Dionysius and the consulship of Probus & Philoxenus, but other linkages give the same outcome. As noted above, Dionysius also associated AD 525 with Era of Diocletian 241, so, since a linkage can be made between



Era of Diocletian 171 and the consulship of Valentinian III & Anthemius (the year when the Vandals were said to have sacked Rome), this year would also correspond to AD 455, which is entirely consistent with the first linkage. Furthermore, Prosper dated this same consulship to AP 428, and the linkage mentioned above between the Victorian Easter Tables (using AP dates) and the Dionysian Easter Tables (using AD dates) again leads us to conclude that the consulship of Valentinian & Anthemius, AP 428, is the same year as AD 455.
Let us now examine yet another linkage, and the consequences of applying it to a chronicle which makes no significant use of dating by reference to consulships. The chronicle is that of Hydatius, written in Spain during the 5th-century, and the linkage that supplied by Julian of Toledo who, as we have seen, associated Spanish Era 724 with AD 686. Here are some events noted by Hydatius, using Spanish Era dates, with, in brackets, the corresponding AD dates, determined from the relationship provided by Julian of Toledo: Era 447 (AD 409) Alaric and his Goths sacked Rome; Era 449 (AD 411) Constantine the usurper was killed in Gaul; Era 454 (AD 416) Wallia made peace with Rome; Era 462 (AD 424) Emperor Honorius died; Era 470 (AD 432) a great battle took place between Bonificius and Aëtius; Era 477 (AD 439) Gaiseric the Vandal seized Carthage; Era 489 (AD 451) Marcian succeeded Emperor Theodosius II; Era 490 (AD 452) Attila invaded Gaul but was defeated and driven back by Aëtius with support from the Visigoths; Era 491 (AD 453) Attila retreated from northern Italy and died soon afterwards; Era 492 (AD 454) Aëtius was murdered; Era 493 (AD 455) Valentinian and Maximus were killed in Rome and Gaiseric the Vandal sacked the city; Era 496 (AD 458) Emperor Marcian was succeeded by Leo; Era 499 (AD 461) Severus became western emperor but died in the 4th year of his reign; Era 503 (AD 465) Anthemius was proclaimed western emperor.
So, with each linkage, we get AD dates for the same events which are generally consistent with each other, and with the conventional chronology, to within a small number of years. However, they are, nevertheless, dates inferred from linkages. No AD dates were given in any of the chronicles or histories we have examined so far. Dionysius introduced his AD system to date the years in Easter Tables, and that remained its sole use throughout the 6th and 7th centuries. Bede, writing in the 8th-century in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People, was the first to use the AD system for dating historical events, and, although this work was largely concerned with events following the arrival of Christian missionaries in England in AD 597, Bede, in the earlier sections, dated the crossing of the Rhine by the Vandals, Alans and Sueves to AD 407, the sack of Rome by Alaric and the Goths to AD 409, the death of Emperor Honorius to AD 423 and the accession of Emperor Marcian to AD 449 [23]. These dates are very close to those which may be inferred, on the basis of linkages, from the chronicles of the previous centuries.
This work by Bede stimulated the production of more than thirty AD-dated chronicles in continental Europe during the next few centuries. Most of these were concerned with relatively recent events, but some began much further back in time, making use of sources available to the compilers. A good example is the chronicle of Hermann of Reichenau, also known as Hermann the Cripple, who died in AD 1054. Amongst the details in his entries for the period in which we are concerned are the following: AD 406 Vandals, Sueves and Alans crossed the Rhine; AD 408 Stilicho was killed and Arcadius died; AD 410 Alaric and his Goths sacked Rome; AD 411 Constantine the usurper was killed; AD 416 Wallia made peace with Rome; AD 423 Honorius died, Pope Boniface was succeeded by Celestine; AD 432 Aëtius and Bonifacius fought a great battle; AD 439 Gaiseric occupied Carthage; AD 440 Leo became pope; AD 444 Attila became king of the Huns; AD 450 Marcian became emperor; AD 452 Attila was killed; AD 453 Aëtius was killed; AD 454 Valentinian and Maximus were killed, Gaiseric and the Vandals sacked Rome; AD 462 Hilarus became pope; AD 466 Anthemius became emperor; AD 473 Zeno succeeded Leo I and Leo II as emperor in Constantinople, while, in the west, Nepos succeeded Glycerius as emperor; AD 476 Odoacer became king of Italy; AD 489 Theodoric the Ostrogoth invaded Italy; AD 492 Theodoric killed Odoacer [24].
Another example is the chronicle by Marianus Scottus, an Irish monk who lived in Germany and died at Mainz in AD 1082. Marianus dated each annual entry in his chronicle using both the Dionysian AD system and his own “Gospel Truth” one, dates in the latter system consistently being 22 years higher than those in the former. Here are the Dionysian AD dates he gave to some events of interest to us: AD 405 Vandals and Alans crossed the Rhine and invaded Gaul; AD 408 Arcadius died in Constantinople; AD 410 Alaric sacked Rome; AD 411 Constantine was killed; AD 416 Wallia made peace with the Romans; AD 422 Pope Boniface died; AD 423 Honorius died; AD 432 Aëtius battled against Bonifacius; AD 439 Gaiseric gained control of Carthage; AD 440 Leo became pope; AD 451 Attila was driven from Gaul; AD 454 Aëtius was killed; AD 455 Valentinian and Maximus were killed, Gaiseric sacked Rome; AD 465 Hilarus became pope; AD 467 Leo sent Anthemius to Italy to become emperor; AD 474 Zeno succeeded Leo, Nepos succeeded Glycerius; AD 476 Odoacer killed Orestes and seized power; AD 488 Theodoric invaded Italy; AD 494 Theodoric killed Odoacer [25].
So, in summary, it can clearly be seen that chronicles from the 5th-7th centuries, using a variety of dating systems, gave timescales for events from the invasion of Gaul by German tribes shortly before the sacking of Rome by Alaric the Goth, to and beyond the seizing of power by Odoacer some years after the sacking of Rome



by Gaiseric the Vandal, which are generally consistent with the conventional chronology of the 5th-century, but not with Gyula’s theory. Furthermore, chronicles from the 11th-century, using the AD dating system, gave dates for events throughout this period which are the same as those currently accepted, to within a small number of years. It should also be pointed out that the 11th-century chronicles were written when the Julian calendar was in operation. The Gregorian calendar was not introduced for another 500 years.
The Julian and Gregorian Calendars
The Gregorian calendar was introduced during the 16th-century because, by then, it had become apparent that the Julian calendar, with one leap-year every four years, had an average year-length slightly longer than the solar (or tropical) year, the time for the Sun to return to exactly the same position in the cycle of seasons. That had implications for calculating the correct date for Easter, which, to medieval Christians, was an extremely important matter. At the Council of Nicaea, held when Paulinus & Julian were consuls (AD 325), it was agreed that the date of Easter should be calculated on the basis of rules relating to the first full moon on or after the vernal equinox, but that assumed the vernal equinox to be a fixed-point. It was recorded that, at the time of the Council of Nicaea, the vernal equinox occurred on 21 March, but, by the 16th-century, it was occurring more than a week too early, because of the discrepancy between the average length of a Julian year and the solar year. There were also increasingly-obvious discrepancies between the theoretical lunar cycles used in Easter determinations and actual lunar cycles, but it was the drift of the vernal equinox that indicated a fundamental problem with the Julian calendar. Pope Gregory XIII was determined to solve the problem, and he sought the advice of experts. To keep the average calendar year in line with the solar year would require just three fewer leap-years in a period of four centuries, so the Gregorian calendar was developed on that basis. That was straightforward enough for future operations, but it was also proposed that the historical slippage should be rectified, and the vernal equinox brought back to what it had been at the time of the Council of Nicaea, by a oneoff removal of 10 days from the current calendar. The first nations to implement that proposal, as part of the switch from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar, were Italy, Portugal, Spain and Poland, who removed the 10 days by jumping from the 4th to the 15th October in AD 1582. Other countries followed suit at later times. However, in every case, the AD year remained the same, before and after the switch. The introduction of the Gregorian calendar undoubtedly resulted in some confusion about the precise date within a year between people from countries who had made the switch and ones from countries where the Julian calendar was still being used, but all could agree about what year it was, except during a brief period around the time of the transition of one year to the next [26].
It is difficult to see how the switch from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar could possibly have confused modern scholars into placing the same 25-year period twice into the history of the 5th-century, with a 44-year separation between analogous events. In any case, as we have just seen, AD-dated sequences generally consistent with the currently-accepted chronology of the 5th-century were being presented in chronicles during the 11th-century, 500 years before the Gregorian calendar was formulated.
Final Comments
It is not the purpose of this article to argue that the conventional chronology or conventional history is correct. Attention has simply been drawn to evidence that needs to be considered as part of any meaningful discussion about the chronology of the 5th-century AD.
