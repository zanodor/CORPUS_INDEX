THE STORM-GODS OF THE ANCIENT NEAR EAST: SUMMARY, SYNTHESIS, RECENT STUDIES*
PART I
DANIEL SCHWEMER
Abstract
In many regions of the ancient Near East, not least in Upper Mesopotamia, Syria and Anatolia where agriculture relied mainly on rainfall, storm-gods ranked among the most prominent gods in the local panthea or were even regarded as divine kings, ruling over the gods and bestowing kingship on the human ruler. While the Babylonian and Assyrian storm-god never held the highest position among the gods, he too belongs to the group of ‘great gods’ through most periods of Mesopotamian history. Given the many cultural contacts and the longevity of traditions in the ancient Near East only a study that takes into account all relevant periods, regions and text-groups can further our understanding of the different ancient Near Eastern storm-gods. The study Wettergottgestalten Mesopotamiens und Nordsyriens by the present author (2001) tried to tackle the problems involved, basing itself primarily on the textual record and excluding the genuinely Anatolian storm-gods from the study. Given the lack of handbooks, concordances and thesauri in our field, the book is necessarily heavily burdened with materials collected for the first time. Despite comprehensive indices, the long lists and footnotes as well as the lack of an overall synthesis make the study not easily accessible, especially outside the German-speaking community. In 2003 Alberto Green published a comprehensive monograph entitled The Storm-God in the Ancient Near East whose aims are more ambitious than those of Wettergottgestalten: All regions of the ancient Near East—including a chapter on Yahwe as a storm-god—are taken into account, and both textual and iconographic sources are given equal space. Unfortunately this book, which was apparently finished and submitted to the publisher before Wettergottgestalten came to its author’s attention, suffers from some serious flaws with

regard to methodology, philology and the interpretation of texts and images. In presenting the following succinct overview I take the opportunity to make up for the missing synthesis in Wettergottgestalten and to provide some additions and corrections where necessary. It is hoped that this synthesis can also serve as a response to the history of ancient Near Eastern storm-gods as outlined by A. Green.

1. ‘Storm-God’: Scope and Limits of a Modern and Ancient Concept
Deities with different names are frequently gathered under a single typological label, whether in Ancient Near Eastern Studies, or in the study of religions in general, when they display a broad agreement with regard to their central functions and profile. Typological classification can bring several deities together within just one cultural context or assemble divinities from different cultural traditions under one type. Typological labels such as ‘stormgod’ have no direct counterpart in the various ancient Near Eastern languages, and the identification of a series of deities as representatives of one particular type does not imply a priori that relationships can be reconstructed by historians of religion or that theological connections were made by the ancient scholars themselves. It is not due to chance, however, that especially translations of ancient Near Eastern cuneiform texts use typological labels so frequently instead of the proper name of a particular deity. In cuneiform, even in scribal traditions that usually show a decided preference for syllabic writing, the proper names of many important deities were regularly written with the sign-combination for a Sumerian deity’s name that served as a logographic writing for the particular god’s name. The selection of a specific Sumerogram (or Akkadogram) to represent a god’s name was normally determined by whatever deity was felt to be typologically related in the Sumerian pantheon to that particular god. The conventional Sumerographic writing of a divine name in cuneiform thus reflects a typological classification of the deity in question from the perspective of the respective scribal tradition. Yet not every Sumerographic convention for writing a divine name was established on the basis of the role of the god represented by the Sumerogram in Sumerian mythology.

1 For a full discussion of the function and problems of typology in modern study of religions and in ancient theology see Wettergottgestalten, 5-9.
Rather the scribal conventions of the neighbouring cuneiform culture from which cuneiform was adopted in the first place served as a direct model; the conventions of the linguistically heterogeneous North Syrian/Upper Mesopotamian area with Akkadian as written language, for example, served as a model for the use of Sumerograms among the Hittites. In texts from regions or eras characterised by the coexistence of different languages and cultural traditions it is often difficult to identify what might be the ‘right’ reading of a Sumerographically written proper names of deities. In such cases one mostly resorts to the typological label (‘storm-god’ etc.). Indeed, Sumerographically written divine names were consciously used by the ancient scribes in this way. Thus, Sumerographically written divine names may well have been occasionally realised differently in letters of international correspondence in the usage of the sender to that of the recipient. Most importantly, however, the two- or three-columned god-lists, which were ordered according to criteria of theological typology and stemmed from the school tradition of Babylonia, although the genre spread to Assyria, Upper Mesopotamia and Syria, use the Sumerogram as the higher rubric to which various concrete names are assigned.1 The manifold contacts between the regions and cultures of the ancient Near East also led to the proximity and co-existence of different polytheistic systems and thus to identifications and syncretisms between typologically similar deities with different names. Conversely local forms of the same god could be worshipped under various different names or epithets within one cultural context. Most ancient Near Eastern deities can therefore not be considered in isolation, but need investigation within the realms of a typologically coherent group. The definition of such a group should take its starting point from a manifestation of the particular type of god that is well documented in text and image, whose modus operandi, profile and basic functions serve as basis for the definition of the type; in the case of storm-gods the Assyro-Babylonian Adad would be the obvious starting-point. All those deities considered to be typologically related with the god chosen as starting-point or with each



the storm-gods of the ancient near east 125
2 Such an overly broad definition of the type ‘storm-god’ can be found e.g. in W. Gerhardt’s dissertation The Weather-God in the Ancient Near Eastern Literature with Special Reference to the Hebrew Bible (Dropsie College, Philadelphia 1963, supervised by M. Held), and is, in my opinion, also one of the basic methodological flaws in Green’s Storm-God (2003); an example of how such overly broad definitions necessarily mislead collegues in neighbouring disciplines is A. Lichtenberger, Kulte und Kultur der Dekapolis, ADPV 29, Wiesbaden 2003, 36-39.
other, in as far as this is attested by the evidence of ancient Near Eastern texts and images, are then to be included in the inquiry. Furthermore, those deities should be included, whose basic profile corresponds to the generic definition, though connections to one of the gods from the first group are not recognisable in the transmitted corpus of texts and images. Given that the criteria of modern and ancient typology are mostly the same and that for many deities no detailed profile can be deduced from the sources, there are very few deities that can be assigned to this group (but see here 9.). According to this definition the most important ancient Near Eastern storm-gods are the Semitic Hadda—West Semitic Hadda, Haddu, Hadad (Syria-Palestine, Upper Mesopotamia), Akkadian Adad, Addu (Babylonia, Assyria)—, Syro-Palestinian Baalu (Baaal), Hurrian Tessub (Tessob) along with Urartian Teiseba (Syria, Mesopotamia, Kurdish mountain area, Anatolia), Hattian Taru and Hittite-Luwian Tar¢un(t) (Anatolia). On the other hand gods whose profile intersects in some respects with several or one of the ‘actual’ storm-gods without the basic distinction between the relevant deities being affected or without their mutual points of contact having led to a typologically motivated equation in antiquity, are better not to be assigned to the category ‘storm-god’. There is little to be gained from establishing an overly broad category that neither corresponds to a comparable category in ancient theology nor reflects any historical developments manifest in the available sources. Of course it deserves attention that a number of gods whose basic profile is not that of a typical storm-god are associated with phenomena like wind, storm and flood; but declaring them to be ‘stormgods’ or even manifestations of ‘the storm-god’ does not lead to a meaningful interpretation of the phenomenon. Among the gods that are often misleadingly addressed as ‘storm-gods’ in secondary literature are above all:2 Enlil: The Sumerian father and lord of the gods is, together with the more remote An, the powerful ruler of the world who bestows



126 daniel schwemer
3 Enlil’s standard epithet “father of the gods” is already attested at Ebla (see F. Pomponio—P. Xella, Les dieux d’Ebla, AOAT 245, Münster 1997, 9); for An and Enlil bestowing kingship cf. e.g. the first lines of the prologue to the Laws of Lipitestar. 4 Attested in a number of passages, most clearly in the opening lines of the Song of the Hoe (ETCSL t.5.5.4).
5 Nippur’s epithet dur-an-ki is already attested in the Fàra-period zà-me hymns (see for the opening passage devoted to Enlil M. Krebernik, “Zur Einleitung der zà-me-Hymnen aus Tell Abù Íalàbì¢, in: Beiträge zur altorientalischen Archäologie und Altertumskunde. Fs. B. Hrouda, ed. P.

Wiggermann, “Mythological Foundations of Nature”, in: Natural Phenomena. Their Meaning, Depiction and Description in the Ancient Near East, ed. D.J.W.

Michalowski, “The Unbearable Lightness of Enlil”, in: Intellectual Life of the Ancient Near East (CRRAI 43), ed. J. Proseckÿ, Prague 1998, 237-247. 9 See the passages quoted by Jacobsen, Treasures of Darkness, 101-103 (for the three passages from Udam ki amus [p. 101, 102f.] see now CLAM I, 120ff.). Note that some of the passages quoted by Jacobsen, “The lil2 of dEn-lil2”, 271 to prove Enlil’s primary association with storm and wind do not stand up to closer scrutiny: Enlil is only one of a number of gods to be associated with one of the four winds (see Wettergottgestalten, 682 fn. 5609 with references); in the Sumerian proverb 3.25 in-bul-bul is not “sweeps along”, but “chaff ” (see B. Alster, Proverbs of Ancient Sumer, Bethesda 1997, vol. I 84-85); in MSL 14, 332: 10-13 (Aa) Enlil is only one of a number of deities associated with ud (besides Adad, Sîn and Istar, cf. also MSL 14, 95: 151:2-3: Samas and Adad [Proto-Aa]).
kingship.3 He creates the universe by dividing heaven and earth;4 residing in Nippur, the “bond between heaven and earth”,5 his special cosmic sphere are the earth (ki) and the lands (kur-kur), while heaven is ruled by An and the nether world by Ereskigal.6 Consequently Enlil is associated especially with the abundant growth of grain,7 but also with the space of air between heaven and earth; the latter may be reflected in his name.8 Within this context it cannot surprise that Enlil’s violent power can be likened to a devastating storm in literary texts.9 There is, however, no reason to assume that these passages refer to Enlil’s primary or original cosmological role within the Sumerian pantheon, and it is worth noting that the image of a devastating storm is used in Sumerian

literature to describe the power of any major god; Enki, for example, praises himself as “great storm (u4-gal) rising over the great earth” (Enki and the World Order l. 69).
Ninurta (Ningirsu): The prototypical Enlil-son embodies the type of the young warlike god who takes over the kingship from his father after having proved his supremacy by defeating the land’s enemies and forces of chaos. The same basic mythological motif is also connected with various storm-gods in different ways, just as conversely Ninurta, who is also a god of agriculture, in his role as warrior has power over storm and flood as weapons. Unlike IskurAdad whose rule over storms and flood includes his responsibility for rain and the growth of vegetation, in the hands of Ninurta storm and lightning are devastating weapons only, and his characterisation as a ‘storm-god’ is restricted to his acting as a warrior. That both, Ninurta and Adad, were envisaged as young storm- and lightning-wielding warriors was as obvious to the Babylonian scholars as it is to us, and a number of isolated associations between the two gods are attested in Sumerian literature and in Akkadian texts.10 Given the overall picture, however, these passages cannot be interpreted as traces of a true syncretism or a common origin of the two gods. Marduk: Marduk’s unparalleled rise from local city-god of Babylon to head of the Babylonian pantheon and king—even god—of the gods makes him a notoriously difficult to characterise god. Sources for his role in 3rd mill. religion and his specific profile within the local pantheon of Babylon are almost non-existent,11 and from the early 2nd mill. onwards his new role as young king of the gods is described and legitimised by using mythological motifs traditionally associated with other, more traditional divine kings, especially Ninurta, but also Enlil and probably Syrian Haddu as well.12 Within

the framework of the more developed Marduk theology of the late 2nd and 1st mill. the god can be identified with many of the Babylonian great gods and his profile becomes less and less well defined. One of the gods occasionally identified with Marduk in late 2nd and 1st mill. theology is the storm-god Adad,13 and, already in Enùma elis, Marduk rules over the winds;14 also the lightning bolt is probably once attested as a symbol accompanying Marduk.15 Like Haddu of Aleppo he defeats the sea before becoming king of the gods; in his role as new Ninurta, storms, lightning and flood are among his weapons. Enbilulu, a god in charge of canals and irrigation, who seems originally to belong to the pantheon of Eridu, is identified with Marduk of Babylon, a development that probably went hand in hand with the identification of Marduk and Asallu¢i, like Enbilulu a son of Enki-Ea. A late theological list designates Enbilulu as the Adad, i.e. storm-god, of Babylon, and occasionally Adad is characterised as in charge of underground waters, just as Enbilulu is associated with rain in a few places.16 The identification of both Marduk and Adad with Enbilulu is, however, only an indirect connection between the two gods, and, more importantly, none of the points of contact that we have mentioned provide any proof for the hypothesis that Marduk himself originally was regarded as a local storm-god before acquiring a much broader profile due to his preeminent role in later Babylonian theology. Given that his traditional symbol is the spade it seems not unlikely that Marduk was conceived as a god associated with agriculture, and more specifically with the building and maintenance of canals.17 It goes without saying that such a profile would be very fitting for a god who was integrated into the pantheon of Eridu as son of Ea, the god of underground water, and identified with Enbilulu, the divine inspector of canals.

Crowell, “The Development of Dagan: a Sketch”, JANER 1 (2001) 32-83, Feliu, Dagan (cf. my review ZA 96 [2006] 270-273), A. Archi, “Translation of Gods: Kumarpi, Enlil, Dagan/Nisaba, ›alki”, OrNS 73 (2004) 319-336. For Dagàn’s iconography see A. Otto, “Das Oberhaupt des westsemitischen Pantheons ohne Abbild? Überlegungen zur Darstellung des Gottes Dagan”, ZA 96 (2006) 242-268.
Anzu(d)-Anzû: The terrifying being of the mythic bird Anzu(d)Anzû is commonly associated with the storm, and the image of the crying monstrous bird in the sky may be a mythological personification of the roaring (dust) storm or the storm cloud itself. There are, however, no sources that would associate the mythical bird with Iskur or Adad; contexts describing him explicitly as a storm-demon are lacking so far, though the cuneiform signs used to write his name (im.mi, im.dugud, both spellings attested early on) seem to suggest some connection with the storm wind (see Wettergottgestalten, 172-173 with the relevant references). Dagàn: Dagàn was mainly worshipped in the Middle Euphrates region. In the extant sources he is clearly characterised as father and lord of the gods and consequently he was associated with Hurrian Kumarbi and Babylonian Enlil. His functions include ensuring abundance of crops, but there is no evidence for characterising him as a storm-god.18 Itùrmèr: He is an ancestral god of the dynasty of Zimrì-Lìm of Mari, whose name is to be analysed as a personal name (Itùr-Mèr) and must be kept separate from the actual storm-god, W/Mèr (see Wettergottgestalten, 203-204 with the relevant references).
2. Natural Phenomenon and Divine Manifestation
Storm and tempest (along with lightning, thunder, clouds, rain and wind) belong to those natural phenomena that cannot be influenced by human intervention and, at the same time, are of immediate significance in agrarian societies for the survival of humans. Storm and tempest were felt to be a numinous power in all ancient Near Eastern societies; everywhere one of the great gods was thought to be the embodiment of and lord over the storms, tempests and associated phenomena. The relative significance and sphere of activities of the individual storm-gods was dependent, among other things,



130 daniel schwemer
19 See Wettergottgestalten, 163-165, 176-178, 179ff., esp. 182-183. 20 A tendency that can also be observed in Green’s Storm-God.
on the climatic conditions in the individual regions. Thus the stormgod as bringer of rain has no role in the agrarian rituals of Babylonia, where agriculture was characterised by irrigation, while his characteristic as lord of the destructive storm—including dust-stormsis prominent. Particular significance for sea-faring can only be demonstrated for the storm-god in the Levantine harbour-city of Ugarit; a connection between storm and mountain gods is typical for landscapes in which cloud topped mountains can be observed etc. On the whole the storm-gods venerated in those parts of the ancient Near East more characterised by rainfall agriculture and dry farming, i.e. in Upper Mesopotamia, Syria, Anatolia and also in Assyria, occupy a more significant position among the great gods than in Babylonia, where Iskur-Adad as a rule belongs to the less important of the great gods. But the particular significance of a storm-god within a local or regional pantheon is also dependent on many other factors, including the political. Also one should bear in mind that the imaginative world of religious literature is not necessarily restricted to the immediate experience of its authors. Thus the Babylonian stormgod Iskur-Adad appears from the earliest attestations as the propagator of plant-growth as well—a motif that is significantly missing from rituals of the same region, which are more tightly bound to everyday life.19 The relationship between the immediate experience of a natural phenomenon and the ideas associated with the divine manifestation perceived in the natural phenomenon, is of itself complex and additionally influenced by other factors. A reconstruction of this relationship as a simple transfer of the characteristics of the natural phenomenon into the world of religious imagery, as is often attempted,20 over-simplifies the evidence and gives rise to misleading schematisations.
3. Sumerian Iskur
3.1 Name and Early History
The god particulary responsible for storms, wind, lightning, thunder and rain in texts written in the Sumerian language is called Iskur. His name is written with the same word-sign that also stands



the storm-gods of the ancient near east 131
21 The reference to “a late Early Dynastic tablet from Mari” (Storm-God, 49) is largely irrelevant within this context, as the writing diskur in pre-Sargonic texts from Mari stands for Semitic Hadda (see Wettergottgestalten, 279-280). 22 See Wettergottgestalten, 131 (add there, fn. 902, A. 1209: 5 quoted in CAD E 172b), 134-135 and 136-137 with detailed references.
for the Sumerian word /im/ “wind, storm” (the oldest attestations have the form ni2 = ZATU 396, not im = ZATU 264). The etymology of the name is unknown. Iskur could be a case of an old polysyllabic Sumerian word that was no longer used apart from the name. At least just as probable, however, is that the name Iskur is of non-Sumerian (and non-Semitic) or ‘pre-Sumerian’ origin; speculation about a foreign origin of the god, however, brings us no further. Iskur is indirectly attested as early as the Uruk period citylist in the writing of his cult centre, Karkar, with the sign ni2. Iskur is also already attested in the Early Dynastic god-lists from Fàra and Tell Abù Íalàbì¢ (Wettergottgestalten, 11-12, 29-31, 129).
3.2 Development of the Cult in the Third Millennium
While the worship of Iskur in Babylonia thus reaches back into the prehistoric period, explicit evidence for the god’s cult can only be demonstrated in the pre-Sargonic period, namely for the cities Lagas and Adab (Wettergottgestalten, 129-131).21 Certain entries in the administrative documents from Adab must be concerned with functionaries of Karkar, not far from Adab. There Iskur was worshipped as the main god of the local pantheon, as the lists of gods and placenames from Fàra and indirectly the city-list from Uruk attest (cf. later above all the Karkar Temple-Hymn of En¢eduana, the Utu¢engal inscription, the Prologue of the Laws of ›ammuràpi, the Temple Lists and numerous hymns and prayers).22 Evidence from Karkar itself (Tell ]idr on the Tigris?) is not yet available, so that little is known about the cult at the local Iskur temple, the é-u4-gal-gal-la “House of the big storms”, or any local Iskur traditions. There is little that can be said with any certainty about the further development of the cult in the course of the third millennnium, due to the scarcity of sources, which is at least partly due to Iskur’s secondary significance within most of the local panthea of Babylonia. From the Sargonic period on, besides Sumerian personal names with the theophoric element Iskur, Akkadian personal names with the theophoric element Adad or Adda are in evidence (Sumerographically diSkur, but more rarely syllabically too, see Wettergottgestalten,



132 daniel schwemer
23 See Wettergottgestalten, 135-163 on the evidence for Iskur’s cult in Karkar (136ff.), Girsu (140ff.), Umma (145ff.), Nippur (150ff.), Ur (158ff.) and Uruk (161f.). 24 Wettergottgestalten, 152, 158-160, 196-197; for the role of foreign princesses in introducing new religious traditions to the royal court see now also T. Sharlach, “Foreign Influences on the Religion of the Ur III Court”, SCCNH 12 (2002) 91-114.
132-133). In the Ur III period Akkadian personal names with the theophoric element Adad are far more frequently attested than Sumerian personal names with Iskur; the fact that the latter in the Ur III period display a far higher density of attestation than in the previous eras despite a restricted number of formal types, is probably not only due to the multiplicity of the transmitted documents, but also to the influence of Akkadian nomenclature (see infra, 4.2, for the relationship between Iskur and Adad). In the Ur III period Iskur shrines are attested in a larger number of cities, without these having had a pre-eminent significance within the religious life of the individual settlements or for the religious politics of the kings of Ur.23 Only the queen Sulgisimtum, who hailed from the long since Akkadian-speaking area of North Babylonia, seems to have propagated the cult of Iskur (Adad) in any particular way, along with those of other deities from her homeland.24 A series of administrative documents attests special field rituals that were carried out for Iskur, as the divine storm, when a storm threatened or in case of storm- or flood-damage (Wettergottgestalten, 163-165).
3.3 Deities Associated with Iskur
With respect to the filiation of Iskur, there are two competing traditions within Sumerian literature. In many texts the god of heaven, An (Anu) is seen as the father of Iskur (Adad); this presumably already old tradition takes over completely after the Old Babylonian period. The father of the gods and son of An, Enlil, also appears as the father of Iskur, mostly in mythological passages which describe Iskur as the youthful warrior who goes into battle for his fathera motif that is primarily connected with Ninurta, the archetypal son of Enlil. Given that the filiation to Enlil appears to be attested already pre-Sargonically outside of the various motifs of defeating enemies, this tradition cannot be simply explained by a—limitedsyncretism of Iskur and Ninurta. We probably have two different

local traditions; the Enlil-tradition may actually have its roots in Nippur.25 The wife of Iskur was held to be the goddess Medimsa, who is already attested in the Fàra-period and whose name, following the later writing, was interpreted as dme-dim2-sa6 “Having beautiful limbs” without this necessarily having to capture the original etymology. Medimsa is explicitly attested as the wife of Iskur only in tablets inscribed in the Old Babylonian period (god-lists, Sumerian religious literature); but there is no good reason to doubt the antiquity of the concept. There are no sources that provide any detailed information on Medimsa’s character and attributes, but the sometimes naked rain-goddess depicted at the side of the storm-god on Akkadian cylinder seals is likely to be a pictorial representation of Iskur-Adad’s consort.26 Iskur, who is responsible for heavenly waters, is praised as the twin brother of the son of An, Enki (Ea), who rules over the underground waters. Significantly the converse epithet is not found in connection with the much more distinguished Enki, for whom it would hardly have been an honour to be addressed as twin of the lower-ranking Iskur.27 Vizier and messenger of Iskur is held to be the lightning god Nimgir, given that lightning descends from the celestial seat of Iskur down to the earth (Wettergottgestalten, 59f.).
3.4 Modus Operandi in Religious Literature
With a few exceptions, all the myths and compositions in Sumerian that can give us information about Iskur’s sphere of activities in the world of religious ideas are transmitted on tablets written in the Old Babylonian period—a time by which Iskur had been long since merged into a single deity with Adad, with his roots in the Akkadian language tradition. There is, however, no compelling reason to generally deny a greater antiquity to texts that were transmitted late, and the traditions they re-work are likely to be older

28 The Sumerian cultic songs addressing Iskur are apparently extensively treated by W.W. Doyle, The Storm-God Iskur-Adad: Texts and Studies, Diss. Harvard 1976. The study, not distributed by UMI, is frequently quoted in Green’s Storm-God, but still unavailable to me. While it is regrettable that the study could not be used at the time of writing Wettergottgestalten, it should be noted that many later treatments of the relevant texts (especially those by M.E. Cohen) are missing from the bibliography in Green’s book whose discussion seems to rely heavily on Doyle’s dissertation. It should be noted that an entirely new Sumerian hymn to Iskur has become known in the meantime. M.J. Geller, who brought the text to my attention and prepared a copy of the tablet, informs me that Laurent Herbenstreit is planning to publish the interesting text in a forthcoming fascicle of RA. 29 See the references in Wettergottgestalten, 178f. and 175f. fn. 1238, 189ff. 30 See Wettergottgestalten, 176-183, 196; for the passage quoted from Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta (177f.) see now ETCSL 1.8.2.3.

than the texts themselves, even if they represent compositions contemporary to the extant manuscripts. Essentially three complexes of motifs are connected with Iskur in the relevant sources:28 1) the destroyer who threatens fields and settlements with storm and flood,29 2) the bringer of rain, who nurtures vegetation and fauna, 3) the young warrior who goes into battle against an enemy land on his chariot drawn by storm-demons for his old father, An or Enlil, and lays waste to it. The motif of the bringer of rain is already attested in the Fàraperiod (so-called zà-me-hymns, compare also the Karkar temple hymn) and can be found in many later myths and cultic songs. It is worth noting that in Sumerian literature especially the plants of the steppe and the roaming flocks are said to profit from Iskur’s rain whereas the irrigated fields are threatened by his violent storms. But as the myth Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta shows one was well aware of the fact that the storm-god’s rain produced abundance of crops in other areas of the Near East.30 The concept of Iskur as the bringer of rain may be connected with the idea of a cyclical return of Iskur at the beginning of the year, but the evidence for this is scant.31 It is also uncertain whether such an idea forms the background of a fragmentarily known, already pre-Sargonically attested myth in which Iskur is held captive in the nether world.32 Be that as it may, it should be emphasised that the often-found characterisation of the Babylonian storm-god as a god of devastating storms in contradistinction to the storm-gods of Syria and Anatolia,



the storm-gods of the ancient near east 135
who are to be considered as rain-gods, is, while not entirely wrong, an unwarranted simplification and generalisation of the sources. The motif of the young warrior is primarily known from the Ersema-songs addressing Iskur, which give the most impressive descriptions of the wild, loud roaring storm-god, who flattens everything in his path, by way of hymnic praise of the deity at the beginning of each composition. The motif itself shows clear points of contact with the mythology of Ninurta, without this having led to more extensive theological associations between Ninurta and Iskur. Ninurta is simply the most prominent representative of the genre of the warlike young son-god—a role that was (partially) associated also with other gods. There is no support for the central motif of the Ninurta mythology, the assumption of kingship after a victorious return, being associated with Iskur as well (see Wettergottgestalten, 183-188, 173f.).
4. Semitic Hadda
The cult of the semitic storm-god Hadda extended—like the Semitic languages—over the whole Near East. In the individual regions and eras different profiles of the god called upon by the name Hadda (and its phonetic variants) developed. We will distinguish in the following between two main lines of tradition that can be connected roughly with the Syro-Upper Mesopotamian area on the one hand (4.2) and the Assyro-Babylonian cultures on the other (4.3).
4.1 Name and Early History
The first textual attestation of the god Hadda can be found in the middle of the 3rd mill. in the cuneiform texts from North Syrian Ebla, where he belongs to the most important gods of the pantheon. The syllabic writing d’à-da always used in Ebla represents the oldest form of the name and is to be realised as Hadda. Etymologically the name can be connected to the Semitic root *hdd “to thunder”, which is attested in Ethiopic, Arabic and presumably in Hebrew as well, but no longer seems to have been productive in Akkadian and the other Semitic languages of the ancient Near East (Wettergottgestalten, 46).
The name Hadda, which thus represents the numinous experience of thunder and the roaring storm, occurs through time in the various Semitic languages in a number of different forms: in Akkadian



136 daniel schwemer
33 Note however that addu “storm” (for the noun cf. now also B. Groneberg, Lob der Istar, CM 8, Groningen 1997, 26-27 II 28 with fn. 146 on p. 50) seems to be a secondary substantive derived from the divine name while samsu is of course the normal word for “sun” in Akkadian. 34 For an overview of all cuneiform syllabic, Egyptian hieroglyphic, Luwian hieroglyphic and alphabetic spellings of the name known to me in 2000 see Wettergottgestalten, 34-58; for a few important additions see the appendix at the end of this article. More attestations, especially within personal names, could be added by checking systematically the texts published after Wettergottgestalten went to print, but they are unlikely to change the overall picture.
(Babylonian and Assyrian) the initial h is regularly weakened to a glottal stop; the name usually appears in the status absolutus form Adad, which is typical of divine names, without the status rectus form with the nominative ending -u (Addu) ever disappearing. The status rectus form Addu is especially (but not exclusively) used when the text is mainly talking about the natural phenomenon storm and less about the divine person (cf. the Akkadian substantive addu “storm”, similarly the relationship between the forms Samas and samsu).33 Particularly within the theophoric onomasticon, numerous other variant forms can be observed, particularly word final. In western Upper Mesopotamia and in Syria the old form Hadda (or with the nominative ending Haddu) predominates until the end of the 2nd mill. It is only in the cuneiform writing that the intial h is missing (it is rarely realised in writing as ¢/h). Hieroglyphic Luwian seal inscriptions from 13th cent. Emar write the initial sound with the sign i that probably stands here for /ha/. In 1st mill. Aramaic the older form Hadda/u, which was still kept in the onomasticon for a long time, was replaced in monumental inscriptions—presumably under influence from Assyrian—by the form Hadad, which corresponds to the Akkadian status absolutus; this then formed the basis for the representation of the name in Greek and Latin (Adados, Adadus, Adad etc.).34
The fact that the root *hdd is not productive any more in most Semitic languages of the ancient Near East, allows us to infer that the divine name is very old. Conversely Hadda does not belong to the Common Semitic gods which are to be found in all panthea with a Semitic linguistic background (like celestial bodies, the sun and Venus above all). One can conclude from this that the divine name was established by Semitic speakers in the Syro-Upper Mesopotamian area in the prehistoric period. When and where exactly these earliest roots of the god are to be sought and whether

35 This dating was already favoured by J.J.M. Roberts, The Earliest Semitic Pantheon, Baltimore—London 1972, 153. Note that the references to Adda and Addu in pre-Sargonic personal names quoted by Roberts on p. 13 (and uncritically adapted by Green, Storm-God, 51) are based on misreadings (see Wettergottgestalten, 37 fn. 186).
the god worshipped as Hadda was perhaps a new name of a preSemitic storm-god worshipped under a different name by different linguistic groups, cannot be known. All attempts to reconstruct continuities between the inventory of images and symbols known from prehistoric eras (particularly the bull and the bucranion) and the securely attested symbols, attributes or means of representing Hadda in the historic periods, have to face considerable methodological problems (see Wettergottgestalten, 124-127, and infra, 10.).
4.2 Assyro-Babylonian Adad (Addu)
4.2.1 The Third and Early Second Millennium
The early history of Adad’s cult in Babylonia and Assyria can only be schematically sketched because of the poor state of the sources. For all we know, Adad did not belong to the gods worshipped in Babylonia from the earliest historical periods on. The first clear syllabic writings of the divine name Adad are found in Ur III sources. But usually Adad is represented in writing by the Sumerogram diSkur that can often already be found in Akkadian personal names of the Sargonic period. A number of Akkadian personal names of the same period contain a syllabically written theophoric element Adda or Anda (with dissimilation of the geminate), which can hardly be separated from the divine name Hadda (Adda, Adad). These writings, mainly attested in documents from Gasur (later Nuzi), show that in northern Mesopotamia, but in isolated cases also in Babylonia, the older form of the name, as it occurs in the preSargonic texts from Ebla, was well known (see Wettergottgestalten, 46 with detailed references). There are as yet no certain attestations for Adad before the Old Akkadian period, so it seems to be most plausible, as things stand, to assume that the spread of the cult of Adad over the whole of Babylonia and the associated assimilation of the god into the transmitted pantheon of southern Babylonia, which found its most pregnant expression in the actual merging of Iskur and Adad into a single deity, is to be dated to the Sargonic age.35 As shown by the pre-Sargonic texts from Mari on the Middle Euphrates (where diSkur

36 On the problems involved cf. the remarks in Wettergottgestalten, 196ff.; for the general problems of reconstructing the religious beliefs of the Sargonic period and their relationship to the presence of Akkadians in Babylonia during the Early Dynastic periods see A. Westenholz, “The Old Akkadian Period: History and Culture”, in: P. Attiger—W. Sallaberger—A. Westenholz, Mesopotamien: Akkade-Zeit und Ur III-Zeit, OBO 160/3, Göttingen—Fribourg 1999, 78-84. 37 See Wettergottgestalten, 124-125 with fn. 862 and 196-197, cf. also here 10.
is written for Hadda unlike in Syrian Ebla) the simple equation of Iskur and Hadda had already been established at that time, at least in the scribal culture, presumably simultaneously with the spread of Sumerian cuneiform into those areas where Hadda had been worshipped of old. How exactly the cult of Hadda (or Adad) spread in northern Babylonia, Upper Mesopotamia and in the region of later Assyria is unknown; it is equally difficult to assess the possible role the elite of the Akkade dynasty and Sargonic Akkadians in general played in that process.36 By the Ur III period a sharp distinction between Iskur on the one hand and Adad on the other is no longer possible, even if the regional differences in the local cult traditions were certainly still visible. Indeed, the greater significance held by the cult of Adad in the Diyala and Middle Euphrates regions of old appears to have stimulated the cult of Iskur-Adad in Babylonia from time to time (see supra, 3.2). Also one can observe a significant shift in the iconography of the Babylonian storm-god during this period. Whereas Iskur-Adad’s accompanying animal was traditionally the lion-dragon, a storm demon, the bull is increasingly found also in Babylonia as the symbolic animal of the god, a motif that in all probability has its roots in the North Mesopotamian and Syrian area and can only very occasionally be found in Babylonia during the Old Akkadian period. One can interpret this change in the iconography as an indication that traditions connected with the Semitic-Akkadian name Adad (Hadda) were increasingly merging with old traditions associated with Iskur during the Ur III period.37 Iskur-Adad was of particular significance in the cult and royal ideology of the early Old Babylonian dynasties of Isin and Larsa, which, like most of the dynasties newly established in the early 2nd mill. were of Amorite origin. Iskur-Adad is the personal protective deity of several Isin-Larsa kings; unlike the preceding periods, he now as later securely belongs to the group of the ‘great gods’ (Wettergottgestalten, 197f.). Arguably these shifts in religious history,

which become visible in the Ur III period, can be ascribed to the increasing influence of elites with an Amorite background in Babylonia. What this implies for the interpretation of individual Sumerian royal inscriptions and Iskur-prayers of the Old Babylonian period, is mostly hard to estimate. Tradition and innovation are too closely intertwined.
4.2.2 The First Half of the Second Millennium
By the Old Babylonian period, Adad regularly belongs to the circle of the ‘great gods’, whose cults extend over all Babylonia and whose reputation is easily gauged from the frequency of personal names formed with them, by now with few exceptions Akkadian.38 Sanctuaries of Adad are attested for the cities Babylon, Kis, Pada, Dilbat, Lagaba and Sippar in northern Babylonia,39 Esnuna, Saduppûm, Nèrebtum, Mê-Turran and Simmurrum in the Diyala region,40 a number of cities on the Middle Euphrates (cf. 4.3.2) as well as Adab (?), Isin, Nippur, Karkar, Uruk, Larsa and Ur in central and southern Babylonia,41 but could well be assumed for many other settlements. Adad seems to have a particular role as guardian of oaths and thus god of law; oaths are often sworn before a divine symbol of Adad.42 Within the same context, in northern Babylonia as well as in Upper Mesopotmia and Assyria an institution called a ¢amrum,



140 daniel schwemer
43 Independently from its presence in the Old Assyrian colony at Kanes this institution is adopted in Hittite Anatolia as well where it is attested especially in texts of the Hurro-Hittite tradition. For a discussion of the relevant texts see Wettergottgestalten, 245-256. An additional reference to the ¢amrum in kàrum Kanes is kt 94/k 612: 11ff. (courtesy K.R. Veenhof). Further evidence for the possible location of the ¢amrum in Assur itself as discussed in Wettergottgestalten, 246 fn. 1720 comes from kt n/k 511: 30 and kt n/k 1365: 36 referred to by Veenhof, “‘In Accordance with the Words of the Stele’. Evidence for Old Assyrian Legislation”, Chicago-Kent Law Review 70 (1995) 1721 with fn. 12. For an oath in the ¢amrum of the city (Assur) cf. now also kt 88/k 1059 obv. 1-4 (V. Donbaz, “Ma¢ar patrim sa Assur—a New Interpretation”, in: Veenhof Anniversary Volume, ed. W. van Soldt e.a., 92). 44 See Wettergottgestalten, 321f., 323f. (cf. also 221f. fn. 1534 and 284 for Mari). It is interesting to see that the northern Babylonian tradition of invoking Samas and Adad as divine witnesses still survives in 15th/14th cent. Nuzi (Wettergottgestalten, 466 with fn. 3844); for the pair Samas and Adad in Middle Babylonian Babylonia see ibid., 426 with fn. 3530 and 436. 45 The evidence for this comes from the Neo-Assyrian period (Shalmaneser III), but there is little doubt that it reflects practices already well-established in the early 2nd mill. (see M.T. Larsen, The Old Assyrian City-State and its Colonies [Mesopotamia 4], Copenhagen 1976, 211-214).
often a shrine outside the city, plays an important role.43 In Sippar, the main cult centre of the sun-god Samas, but also in other Babylonian cities, Samas and Adad are often called on together as divine witnesses in connection with court-cases and temple loans; sometimes they are joined in this function by the moon-god, Sîn. In general there appear to have been close connections between the temple of Samas and the shrine of Adad in Sippar.44 These close ties between the two gods can hardly be separated from the fact that Samas and Adad are attested in texts of different genres as the gods of divination by means of extispicy from the Old Babylonian period on; but the origin and the exact rationale behind this concept are still unknown (cf. 4.2.6). As for the region that was to become the heartland of the later Assyrian empire, our sources are very much restricted to the city of Assur and the archives of the Assyrian merchants in Anatolian kàrum Kanes. The old Adad temple of the city of Assur is attested already in the early 2nd mill. It will have been among the most significant temples of the city and played an important role as creditor in Old Assyrian foreign trade. The importance of Adad within the traditional pantheon of the the city of Assur is also highlighted by the fact that the ancient institution of choosing a year-eponym was performed before Assur and Adad.45 It is possible that the colony in Kanes had its own Adad temple, but so far all attesta

47 See Wettergottgestalten, 242, 264f., for the double-temples built by Samsì-Adad see P. Miglus, “Auf der Suche nach dem ‘Ekur’ in Assur”, BaM 21 (1990) 303320, esp. 307f. 48 The storm-god’s sanctuary in Arrap¢um is mentioned in a number of texts from the times of Samsì-Adad and his sons; it is possible that already during this period the local cult of the storm-god was largely Hurrian in character and the god himself was called Tessub by the Hurrian population of the region (see Wettergottgestalten, 265-267).
49 Sanctuaries are attested for Nippur, Ur, Babylon, ›ilpu near Sippar and probably also Uruk (see Wettergottgestalten, 424ff., ibid., 428-434 for the Middle Babylonian personal names containing Adad). 50 Note, however, the Middle Babylonian personal name Rìs-Karkara (Wettergottgestalten, 435).
tions of an Adad temple in Kanes refer to the local Anatolian temple of the storm-god.46 As elsewhere in his building projects, SamsìAdad I changed the Adad temple in Assur into a double temple in which beside Adad his father, the sky-god Anu was worshipped. It appears reasonable to assume that the new Anu-Adad temple was erected in the same place where also the old Adad temple of the city had been situated.47 Other important shrines of the stormgod within this general region were located in East-Tigridian Arrap¢um (Arrap¢e)48 and in numerous towns of western Upper Mesopotamia (see below on Haddu and Tessub).
4.2.3 The Second Half of the Second Millennium and the First Millennium
The few sources on the Adad cult that are known from the Middle Babylonian period bear witness to continuous worship in most of the established shrines of Babylonia, without it being possible to follow the particular developments.49 However, outside of literary texts, there are no further attestations of the shrine of Adad at Karkar after the Old Babylonian period; even whether the city itself continued to exist as a major urban centre cannot be shown with certainty. The old cult centre of Adad appears to have gradually decayed,50 without a replacement being found elsewhere in Babylonia proper (but cf. below for Zabban). Consequently Adad was not seen as the main city god of any of the more important Babylonian cities. Nebuchadnezzar I renovated a shrine of Adad in Babylon; the dedicatory inscription composed for this occasion is directed to

The important position of Adad in the inscriptions of the rulers of Simurrum (later Zabban) during the Old Babylonian period suggests that the Adad temple of the city dates back to this period too (see Wettergottgestalten, 359).
Marduk and Adad, which can be understood as an expression of the Marduk-theology practised under Nebuchadnezzar I, which subordinated all gods to Marduk on principle, without an actual equation of Marduk with Adad being implied. The curse formulas of the Middle and New Babylonian kudurru inscriptions call on Adad regularly as the god who should destroy the fields of the contractbreaker by means of storm, drought and flood, thus bringing about a famine.51 The Neo-Babylonian and later sources bear witness to the god’s continual worship in Babylon, Sippar, Borsippa, Uruk and Larsa, even into the Hellenistic period for some cases. Yet everywhere Adad (and with him Sàla) belonged to the lower-ranking deities.52 The only city where Adad was venerated as head of the local pantheon was Zabban in the north-eastern periphery of Babylonia. While the Adad cult at Zabban may look back at a long history, its importance is only evident from 1st mill. sources from both Babylonia and Assyria which show that the temple in Zabban was regarded as the most important shrine of the storm-god in Babylonia. It seems that the temple at Zabban had some ties with Sippar, as rations for Adad and Sàla of Zabban are registered in a NeoBabylonian administrative document from that city (VS 6, 231 obv. 19-20).53 The Anu-Adad temple in Assur remained one of the most prominent holy places of the old Assyrian capital. Numerous rulers undertook building projects or dedicated votive offerings; Neo-Assyrian

ritual texts and the ‘Götteradressbuch’ of Assur provide us some insight into the structure and cultic calendar of the Adad temple in the Neo-Assyrian period. Royal inscriptions and a few texts of Middle Assyrian court literature attest to the significance of Adad’s cult for the royal family. In particular Adad was seen as an important helper on campaign; special war-rituals were performed for him and Nergal, chariots carrying standards of both gods accompanied the king onto the battlefield in the Neo-Assyrian period. Middle and Neo-Assyrian onomastics show a multiplicity of personal names composed with Adad, and names such as Gabbu-Adad “Adad is all”, Gabbi-sa-Adad “All belongs to Adad”, Gabbe-ina-Adad “All is in Adad(’s hands)”, Istu-Adad-gabbu “All comes from Adad”, Adad-bèl-gabbe “Adad is lord of all”, Adad-bà(n)-kala “Adad is the creator of all” and Mannu-sànin-Adad “Who could rival Adad?”none of them ever attested in Babylonia—bear witness to the high rank Adad held in some areas of Assyria and Upper Mesopotamia.54 The position of Adad among the great gods in the Neo-Assyrian imperial pantheon corresponds generally to the tradition dominant since the Old Babylonian period that ranks him after Sîn and Samas.55 In the Neo-Assyrian empire the Adad temple in Kurbahil at the northern-most point of the country was seen as the the main cult centre of the god; the most impressive testimony to the Neo-Assyrian ruler’s sponsorship of this temple is a statue of Shalmaneser III found in Nimrud that carries a dedicatory inscription to Adad of Kurbahil and certainly originally stood—or was intended to standin his temple.56 Further Adad temples are attested for the (temporary)

Note that the Adad temple at Nineveh is already attested in a building inscription of Assurnaßirpal I (preserved on an unpublished tablet from Nineveh, not mentioned in Wettergottgestalten, 609, see D. Stronach, “Village to Metropolis: Nineveh and the Beginnings of Urbanism in Northern Mesopotamia”, in: Nuove fondazioni nel Vicino Oriente antico: Realtà e ideologia, ed. S. Mazzoni, Pisa 1994, 96). A few of the Neo-Assyrian documents from Tell Sè¢ Óamad mention Adad (without toponym) in their penalty clauses; it remains unclear whether the city itself had a temple of the storm-god (see K. Radner, Die neuassyrischen Texte aus Tall Sè¢ Óamad, Berlin 2002, texts 47, 62 and 64). 58 For Adadmilki see Wettergottgestalten, 636-637, for Apladad ibid., 626-628 (note that the Neo-Assyrian texts from Tell Sè¢ Óamad referred to in fn. 5057 and elsewhere have now been published by K.

royal seats of Kàr-Tukultì-Ninurta, Kal¢u (Nimrud), Dùr-Sarrukìn, Nineveh and many other cities in the Assyrian heartland.57 Later developments in the Assyro-Aramaean milieu of the 1st mill. are the hypostasis of Adad (or Hadad), Adadmilki, “Adad the king”, which is only attested in personal names (the relationship to ’drmlk in II Kings 17: 31 is problematic), and the god Apladad, “Son of Adad”, whose cult was above all at home in the Middle Euphrates area and can be attested there until the Hellenistic and Roman periods.58 Outside of Babylonia, in Assyria and Upper Mesopotamia, but also in Syria and Anatolia, one often finds the numeral (d)10 as a logogram for Adad instead of the Sumerogram diSkur at least from the 15th cent. on. It is used with exactly the same meaning as diSkur, both writings are interchangeable. It is not excluded that the writing with the numeral was developed in the North SyrianUpper Mesopotamian area where it is first attested. Through all periods it never became common usage in Babylonian scribal culture, where the simple winkelhaken becomes a logogram for Bèl (umun). The late ‘Astronomical Diaries’, however, use the sign 10 regularly as a shorthand for Adad, and this may reflect an old and originally Babylonian tradition not attested otherwise; it is worth noting that the series Sîn (30), Samas (20), Adad (10) fits perfectly the sequence of gods known from the god-list An—Anum and many later texts. The writing of divine names with numerals at all is cer

59 See Wettergottgestalten, 75-78, where the origin of the logogram is more confidently assigned to traditions outside Babylonia. 60 See Wettergottgestalten, 12-16. Note that “Die bereits in Ur III-zeitlichen Handschriften bezeugte Weidnersche Götterliste” (p. 13) should be corrected to “Die vielleicht bereits in einer Ur III-zeitlichen Handschrift bezeugte Weidnersche Götterliste” (see F. Pomponio, Nabû. Il culto e la figura di un dio del Pantheon babilonese ed assiro, Studi Semitici 51, Roma 1978, 20). 61 Line count according to Wettergottgestalten, 17-28; this corresponds to ll. 206283a in R.L.

tainly a Babylonian invention, and even if the writing of Adad with the numeral 10 orginated outside Babylonia the innovation built on and expanded a Babylonian model.59
4.2.4 Adad in the God-Lists, the Circle of Deities associated with Adad Iskur-Adad is mentioned in nearly all Babylonian god-lists with a more or less comprehensive circle of gods, which as a rule includes, besides Sumerian epithets that had become divine forms, above all Adad’s consort Sàla with or without her Sumerian equivalents. The position of Iskur-Adad and his circle within the single-column godlists of the Old Babylonian period is not very significant and seems to differ from text to text depending on local traditions.60 Adad’s most common ranking among the great gods is reflectedand in later periods greatly influenced—by his positioning in the comprehensive, two-columned, at least essentially Old Babylonian god-list An—Anum, which is already prefigured in the structure of the An—Anum fore-runner TCL 15, 10: Adad and his divine court stand at the end of tablet III after Sîn and Samas along with their circle of gods. Before the three heavenly gods, Sîn, Samas and Adad, the older generation of gods is presented (tablets I-II: Anu, Enlil, Mother Goddess, e.a.), while they are followed by the goddess of the planet Venus, Istar (tablet IV). This basic concept is repeated or slightly modified in many later god-lists and also in numerous lists of gods in other textual genres, especially royal inscriptions. The proximity of Samas and Adad is not surprising in view of the close association of both gods with regard to extispicy and administration of justice in the Old Babylonian period (see supra, 4.2.2, and infra, 4.2.6). The Adad section itself (III 206-278)61 is relatively simple in structure and does not contain any sub-circles. The text can be divided into twelve groups. The general organisation of the various Sumerian

names—most of them typical epithets—equated with Iskur-Adad partly follows the well-known principle that entries beginning with the same cuneiform sign are grouped together:
1. Ll. 206-209: Storm-gods written with the sign IM which is glossed as Iskur, Mur, Ilumèr, Adad and is equated (like all the following entries in the sub-groups 1-6) with the Sumerographic writing diSkur (Adad). 2. Ll. 210-214: Sumerian epithets of Iskur-Adad that can be written with crossed IM or crossed EN. 3. Ll. 215-220: Sumerian epithets of Iskur-Adad that begin with lugal- “lord”. Note that the first of these names, Lugaldal¢amun (dal¢amun written as crossed EN), is linked directly to the preceding entry Dal¢amun (written as crossed EN). 4. Ll. 221-227: Sumerian epithets of Iskur-Adad that begin with u4- “storm”. 5. Ll. 228-231: Different Sumerian epithets of Iskur-Adad (without any recognisable internal coherence). 6. Ll. 232-238: Further Sumerian epithets of Iskur-Adad beginning with lugal- “lord”. The first entry of this group (Lugalgán-sù-sù) is again linked to the preceding entries by common elements (Ug-me-me, Ug-sù, E4-sù). 7. Ll. 239-245: Sàla, the consort of Adad, along with a series of Sumerian goddesses equated with her (Medimsa, Suzabarku, Musme¢us, Kinnusum, Enmelulu). 8. Ll. 246-251: The children of Iskur-Adad: Mìsaru “Justice” with his consort Isartu “Righteousness”, a further son Ußuramàssu “Heed his word”62 and finally three daughters (Subanuna, Menunesi, Namasmas). 9. L. 252: Nimgir “Lightning”, the vizier of Iskur-Adad. 10. Ll. 253-256: The two calves (Sumerian names) and two bulls (Seris and Màgiru) of Iskur-Adad. 11. Ll. 257-262: The six bull-lyres (or according to later interpretation “advisors”, Sumerian gu4-bala∞g) of Iskur-Adad with their eloquent Sumerian names: Suragal “Great lamentation singer”, Usurra “Lamenting storm”, Pirigguduga “Roaring lion”, Ursanita “By his bellowing”, Semungigi “He kept bellowing”.



the storm-gods of the ancient near east 147
63 The inclusion of Is¢ara in this group does not provide sufficient reason to characterise the whole group as a circle of Syrian gods (contra W. Sallaberger, “Pantheon”, RlA 10 [2004] 306). 64 For the text see Wettergottgestalten, 78-86; ibid., 73-78, 86-92 for other relevant texts. 65 It should be noted, however, that Medimsa as consort of Iskur-Adad is not attested before the Old Babylonian period either. Since the goddess herself is already mentioned in texts of the Fàra period this may be due to chance. For Medimsa see Wettergottgestalten, 170-172; cf. also W.G. Lambert, “Sumerian Gods: Combining the Evidence of Texts and Art”, in: Sumerian Gods and Their Representations, ed. I.L. Finkel—M.J. Geller, CM 7, Groningen 1997, 6-7.
12. Ll. 263-278: Appendix to the Adad and Samas circle: different gods with the same or similar logographic writings which are equated above all with Samas or Adad (but also with Ea, Istar and Nissaba) and thus find themselves inserted here after the circle of Samas and Adad but before that of Istar. The section ends with the twin gods Sûllat and ›anis, who are equated with Samas or Adad respectively.63
Among the later divine lists with Adad-sections, the two-columned list K 2100 (CT 25, 16-17) deserves special mention.64 Its Adadsection in obv. I 1-41 doesn’t follow any apparent system and looks very much like a succession of excerpts, as many of the entries are well known from An—Anum and other god-lists. It is different from most other god-lists in one respect, however, namely, that it also integrates foreign storm-gods and equates them with the Sumerogram for the Assyro-Babylonian Adad and calls them “storm-god (resp. Adad) of the land . . .”. Among others, Tessub is mentioned as the storm-god of Subartu, Buriyas as the Kassite storm-god and Addu as the storm-god of the West; other ‘foreign’ storm-gods, such as Baalu and Il¢allabu, are included without any further information on their homeland.
4.2.5 The Goddess Sàla
The goddess Sàla is only attested from the Old Babylonian period; in Babylonia and Assyria she was seen throughout all periods as the consort of Adad and was equated with Medimsa, consort of Iskur (further Sumerian equivalents are mentioned in the twocolumned god-lists, but outside the god-lists, besides Medimsa, only Suzabarku is attested as such).65 The origin and early history of the goddess cannot be reconstructed with certainty. She probably had her roots in eastern Upper Mesopotamia and was associated with

66 For Sàla see Wettergottgestalten, 397-412, cf. also my article “Sàla” in RlA (forthcoming). 67 For Sàlas see Wettergottgestalten, 403-410 with further literature, cf. more recently also Feliu, Dagan, 288-293, D. Fleming, ZA 83 (2003) 35 and my article “Sàlus” in RlA (forthcoming). 68 Sàlas’s cult was introduced to Babylonia as early as the Ur III period, cf. the place-name Bìt-Puzris-Sàlas which is attested in a few texts from Umma (see Wettergottgestalten, 405 with fn. 3400 and W. Sallaberger, ZA 96 [2006] 269f.). Sàlas was equated with the Sumerian goddess Kusig (“gold”) in the Old Babylonian period (MSL 15, 36: 11:28), later god-lists give the name as Ninkusig (“lady gold”, the form Nimkusig is probably only a phonetic variant and not to be interpreted as “golden fly”, contra E. Flückiger-Hawker, Tiere in mesopotamischen Götternamen: Index der Götternamen und Beinamen, 29 [http://www.ane.unibe.ch/lenya/ane/live/forschung/ dissertationen/flueckiger.htm]). 69 Note that in Wettergottgestalten, 412 a reference to the usage of the ear of corn as symbol for Sàla on a Middle Babylonian kudurru should be added (see U. Seidl, “Die babylonischen Kudurru-Reliefs”, BaM 4 [1968] 138).
Hadda (Adad) early on, while in Syria, around the city Aleppo with its important sanctuary of the storm-god, ›èbat (the local goddess of the area?) was considered to be the consort of Hadda (Haddu, Tessub). Even the name Sàla cannot be explained with any certainty; a connection with Hurrian sàla-“daughter” seems most probable.66 Originally Sàla was clearly distinguished from the Syrian-Middle Euphratian goddess Sàlas (a name that later, within the HurroHittite tradition, takes the form Sàlus, too), who had always been considered in that region as the consort of Dagàn and then also the consort of Hurrian Kumarbi, who was identified with Dagàn.67 As a result of the establishment of the cult of Dagàn and his consort in Babylonia and Assyria68 texts from the 14th cent. onwards occasionally confuse the two goddesses. The later manuscripts of An—Anum consider Sàla and Sàlas to be variants of one name. This late contamination of the two goddesses was still apparent as such for at least some of the ancient scholars: the exegetical godlist CT 25, 10 explains Sàlas as “Sàla of the Western Steppe” (cf. also An—Anu sa amèli 59). Sàla was seen primarily as goddess of the fruits of the field and the harvest, being consort of the rain-bringer, Adad, who gives the fields the water they need to thrive. Her symbol is the ear of corn,69 and her astral form is the star Serhu “Furrow” in the constellation Virgo. The latter is depicted as a girl holding an ear of corn on a Seleucid astrological tablet, only separated by Mercury, in the form of an eight-pointed star, from the constellation Corvus which

70 A good photograph of the tablet (AO 6448+,) is reproduced in SAA 8, 182f. (for an edition see E.F. Weidner, Gestirn-Darstellungen auf babylonischen Tontafeln, SÖAW 254/2, Wien 1967). For the association of Adad with Corvus see Wettergottgestalten, 605 fn. 4892, 688f.
71 For Adad as god of divination and his association with Samas within this and other contexts see Wettergottgestalten, 221-226, 284, 683-686. 72 See Wettergottgestalten, 427-428, cf. now also P. Michalowski, “The Scribe(s) of MDAI 57 Susa Omens?”, NABU 2006/41. 73 The tàmìtu and ikribu texts preserve the invocation of both, Samas and Adad, down to the 1st mill., whereas the Sargonid extispicy queries (see SAA 4 for the genre) address Samas only. 74 See 4.3.1, cf. also the sequence Samas—Addu in the god lists of treaties from Mari and Tell Leilan (Wettergottgestalten, 284; for A. 3592, quoted there fn. 1959, see now FM 8, text 34).
is associated with Adad.70 While her symbol suggests a connection between Sàla and the fertile soil of the fields receiving Adad’s rain, other aspects of her iconography show that she was also associated with the rain itself, as it seems very likely that the (sometimes) naked rain-goddess depicted together with the storm-god in 3rd and 2nd mill. art is to be identified with Medimsa-Sàla (see infra, 10.).
4.2.6 Adad as God of Divination
The sun-god Samas and Adad are attested in texts of different genres as the gods providing the oracular decision for the inspection of entrails since the Old Babylonian period.71 The phrase surri Samas u Adad “beginning of (the text concerning) Samas and Adad” could simply be used as a title for collections of extispicy omens.72 We do not know whether this tradition, which is replaced by the invocation of Samas alone at the inspection of entrails only late and never completely,73 is originally Babylonian. Sumerian Iskur is never associated with extispicy in the sources known until now; conversely the connection between Hadda and the sun-god can occasionally be attested in Syria as part of oath-taking as early as pre-Sargonic Ebla.74 This may indicate an origin of the motif in the Syro-Upper Mesopotamian area, but it can hardly prove such a hypothesis. It should be noted that Samas and Adad are referred to as a pair also outside the context of extispicy already in the Old Babylonian period, especially in northern Babylonia. Some documents point to a common role of the two gods within the context of jurisdiction and oath-taking, an area closely associated with extispicy where the two gods also give a verdict; other texts suggest that the connection between the two gods became more general in nature early

Moran, ed. A. Gianto, BibOr 48, Roma 2005, 11-47, esp. 43-45. 76 For Adad in omen apodoses see Wettergottgestalten, 416-419 (Old Babylonian period) and 687-694 (later texts). 77 Cf. the izbu omen tablet from Tigunànum ( M. Salvini, The ›abiru Prism of King Tunip-Tessup of Tikunani, DA 3, Roma 1996, 117-121, cf. Wettergottgestalten, 419) and a few yet unpublished izbu omen texts from a similar background in the Schøyen Collection, Oslo (MS 1806, 2797, courtesy A.R. George).
on, a notion that was certainly reinforced by Samas and Adad being placed one after another in the influential god-list An—Anum and its fore-runner (cf. supra, 4.2.2 and 4.2.4). Objectively the storm-god may have been connected with divination for two reasons: on the one hand he was a celestial god who, being responsible for lightning, rain, clouds etc., had power over numerous ominous phenomena and dwelled in immediate proximity to the celestial sun-god. On the other hand the stormgod was lord of the winds, which were seen in Mesopotamia as the divine carriers; and indeed, an Adad-hymn from Babylonia transmitted in Hittite language praises the god as the one who brings the message of the entrail inspection from the depths of the Apsû to the tangible sheep’s liver.75 In the omen texts themselves Adad plays only a marginal role and is mentioned only in a fairly limited set of apodoses that reflect on his power either to grant plenty by providing rain or destroy the crops through storms and floods.76 It should be noted, however, that the apodoses of a few omen texts from Upper Mesopotamia show the storm-god in a more prominent role, one that is in keeping with his position at the head of many local panthea in this region.77
4.2.7 Modus Operandi in Literary Texts
Typical of Adad’s modus operandi is his ambivalent nature: on the one hand he is the rain-god, occasionally credited further with mastery over subterranean water, who guarantees that the fields thrive and that the country survive; on the other hand he endangers the crop through storm, flood and drought. At the same time his violence in the storm is interpreted as a warlike attribute. Just this ambivalence appears to be the central theme of the Old Babylonian mythological text CT 15, 3-4, a kummu-song for Adad. The warlike

Groneberg, “Searching for Akkadian Lyrics: From Old Babylonian to the ‘Liederkatalog’ KAR 158”, JCS 55 (2003) 59 reads the first two signs in obv. I 1 as [i ]n-¢u; while ¢u instead of the ri preferred in Wettergottgestalten is perfectly possible, it seems difficult to reconcile in with the traces still visible on the tablet and correctly rendered in King’s copy. 79 For the relevant passages of the flood myth see Wettergottgestalten, 422f.; for a recent English translation see B.R. Foster, Before the Muses, 32005, 227-253, note, however, that the interesting passage in II v 16’-17’ (p. 244), clarified by C. Wilcke (“Kleine Notizen zu Atram-¢asìs”, NABU 1997/120) and now nicely confirmed by an unpublished fragment in the Schøyen Collection, Oslo (courtesy A.R. George), is still mistranslated. 80 See M. Krebernik, “Altbabylonische Hymnen an die Muttergöttin (HS 1884)”, AfO 50 (2003-04) 13-15 obv. II’ 13’. 81 Cf. Wettergottgestalten, 207, 423; for the text see now A.R. George, The Babylonian Gilgamesh Epic, Oxford 2003, I 198f. (Yale col. iii 127-134). Note also that my attempt at TIM 9, 45 rev. 46’f. (n. 3512) is now out-dated by George’s edition of the whole text (Gilgamesh Epic, I 252-259).
Adad has destroyed the land in a storm. Enlil sends Adad’s sister, Bèlet-ilì, to appease the god and lead him before Enlil. The latter admonishes Adad to bestow rain and abundance on his own land and to march with the king as a storm of war against the enemy land.78 In the Old Babylonian flood myth, too, it is Adad who is to bring about a famine for humanity through lack of rainfall, and who then has to be guarded in heaven by Anu because of his corruptibility. Apparently this passage was felt to be offensive in later times: in the later version of the flood myth Anu and Adad, father and son, guard the heavens together. The flood itself then is largely brought about by Adad, who comes riding on the four winds, his mules, surrounded by storms and roars with thunder.79 In an Old Babylonian hymn to the mother-goddess the downpour during a thunder-storm is called the “flesh”, i.e. the essence and typical activity, of Adad: [r]àdam sìr Adad nu¢us apêtim “[d]ownpour, the ‘flesh’ of Adad, abundance for the people”.80 According to the Epic of Gilgames, Adad, together with the storm-god Wèr (see infra, 9.1), guards the mountains of the cedar forest where ›uwawa lives. The passage evokes the image of the mountain region overhung with clouds and defended by warlike storm-gods, but is certainly contextualised by the fact that Wèr and Adad (resp. Haddu) were regarded as powerful gods particularly in the regions west of Babylonia.81

K 151 and the duplicate from Nimrud had roughly the same division of the text between obv. and rev., and the estimate of three missing lines in K 151 has to be corrected to approximately 6-8 lines. It is now clear that the incantation obv. 18ff. // 11’ff. ends in obv. 29’ ( . . .] dé-a idim-sú-nu én) and is followed by a ritual instruction (rev. 1-6, much damaged, restore . . . tim-r]i tu-tammar in rev. 4, cf.

The emendation of K 151 rev. 14’ proposed in Wettergottgestalten, 680 with fn. 5588 is supported by the duplicate, the emendation in rev. 15’ is not: the meaning is not affected by these changes. 83 For the suhila prayers addressing Adad see Wettergottgestalten, 666-676; recent English translations of ‘Adad 1a’, ‘Adad 4’ and ‘Adad 2’ can be found in Foster, Before the Muses, 636-639.
1st mill. incantation-rituals call on Adad to protect the crops in cases of storm-damage;82 he is addressed if thunderstorm and lightning ruined a building or if continuously rumbling thunder signaled portending evil. The Akkadian suhila prayers recited during such rituals provide a lively vision of Adad’s activity as storm- and raingod in their hymnic praise sections.83 The motif of the young warrior who defeats the enemies and the powers of chaos, well-known from the Iskur mythology, is apparently still connected with Adad later on: the suhila ‘Adad 1a’ describes him as victor over the Anzûbird. This narrative motif is otherwise primarily associated with Ninurta, especially in the Anzû myth itself, where Adad figures as one of the gods unsuccessfully sent against Anzû before Ninurta is called and vanquishes the rebellious monster.

Archi, “The Head of Kur(r)a—The Head of hAdabal”, JNES 64 (2005) 85 assumes that Hadda’s sanctuary at Ebla was situated within the temple of Kur(r)a. While there is no doubt that Hadda was (occasionally?) worshipped in the temple of Kur(r)a (cf. Wettergottgestalten, 101, 106f.), it seems unlikely that all references to the temple of Hadda (é d’à-da) in the administrative texts refer either to the temple of Hadda of ›alab or to a sanctuary that formed only part of the city-god’s temple. 87 See Wettergottgestalten, 111 with reference to TM.75.G.2507 obv.

This reference is not booked in RGTC 12/1, 280f. in the section on deities with a cult in ‘Saza’. 88 See Wettergottgestalten, 111-112.
89 See Wettergottgestalten, 108-111, 103-105; note that Archi, JNES 64 (2005) 85 apparently assumes that all these references refer to the temple in Aleppo, while at Ebla according to his interpretation Hadda had only a shrine within the temple of Kur(r)a.
Ebla.84 In the Ebla texts the name of the god is always written syllabically d’à-da (Hadda), whereas the contemporary Early Dynastic texts from Mari following Babylonian custom use the logogram diskur.85 According to the cult administration texts Hadda belonged to the group of the most significant gods in Ebla. The temple of the god in Ebla has not yet been securely localised;86 apparently there was also a sanctuary within the ‘palace’ (sa-zaxki).87 A number of further locations surrounding Ebla possessed temples of Hadda, for which rations were booked in Ebla (Hadda of Armi, Abati, Lub and Luban).88 The most significant Hadda sanctuary in Ebla’s domain was however without doubt the temple of Hadda in ›alab (Aleppo, see 4.4). Hadda of ›alab himself possessed sanctuaries outside of ›alab (certainly in Dub), just as in later periods. Whether this was also the case for Ebla is not yet certain. But it is clear that the temple of Hadda in Ebla maintained close administrative ties to the sanctuary in ›alab; even with regard to the cult calendar extensive similarities can be observed.89 Both the temple of the city-god Kur(r)a and the temple of Hadda served as locations for oath-taking. A state treaty is ratified by oath before Kur(r)a and Hadda. Another oath is taken before Kur(r)a, the sun-god and Hadda; in the context of the cursing of a potential oath-breaker Hadda is called upon together with the sun-god. These are the earliest attestations for the invocation of the sun-god together with the storm-god within a jurisdical context, a constellation well known

VI 8 (MME 12, 36) should rather be read d¢a-sa-ba, though d¢a-hà-ba seems not entirely excluded. 92 For a discussion of the arguments involved see Wettergottgestalten, 112-115; on Kur(r)a see now also W. Röllig, “Phönizisches aus Nordsyrien und der Gott Kurra”, in: Punica—Libyca—Ptolemaica, Fs. W. Huß, ed. K. Geus—K. Zimmermann, OLA 104, Leuven 2001, 41-52 and M.G.

Fronzaroli have contributed to a better understanding of the Eblaite incantations, most recently: “The Hail Incantation (ARET 5, 4)”, in: Fs. B. Kienast, ed. G. Selz, AOAT 274, Münster 2003, 89-107.
from Old Babylonian and later Babylonia; given that they are thus far isolated, their significance is difficult to assess.90 The goddess ›àbatu (›ahabatu, always spelled d¢a-a-ba-du)91 was worshipped as the consort of Hadda in ›alab and Ebla. ›àbatu is an early form of the name of the consort of the Syrian stormgod’s consort, ›èbat, who is well-attested from the Old Babylonian period onwards. The etymology of ›èbat is controversial. The ending with the apparent feminine morpheme -at- argues for a Semitic formation. A derivation from the city-name ›alab (“the ›alabaean”), as argued by A. Archi, seems possible, but remains without certain proof. The available 3rd mill. sources give no information whatsoever on ›àbatu’s profile and character. The circle of deities associated with Hadda in this early era is otherwise unknown; attempts to explain the names of the gods Kur(r)a and hAdabal (dni-da-kul) as epithets of Hadda remain unconvincing.92 Hadda is called upon in a group of Eblaite incantations to release evil.93 One of the incantations invokes Hadda so that he might destroy the evil in a storm by throwing hail-‘stones’, a motif that has numerous parallels in the Sumero-Akkadian literature of Babylonia, where it appears as the destruction of the enemies by hail. In a group of very similar incantations the evil is supposed to be magically bound to the weapon of Hadda. A parallel formulation is also used in the same incantations in relation to two other gods, namely Ammarig and Dunnàn. Following later sources it seems likely that Ammarig is a mountain-god, and the same may be true for the otherwise unknown Dunnàn (there is nor evidence for a connection with the dunnànu of Maqlû V 21). If so, this would

be the first attestation of the later well documented connection between mountain- and storm-gods in the Syro-Anatolian area. The hypothesis that these incantations provide the first documentation of the later well-attested and certainly ancient motif of the victory of the storm-god over the sea remains problematic (cf. infra, 8.).
4.3.2 Haddu (Addu): The First Half of the Second Millennium
In Syria and Upper Mesopotamia during the Old Babylonian period the name of the Semitic storm-god usually had the form Haddu according to syllabic writings. In cuneiform the name appears as Addu, rarely ›addu resp. hAddu, in later alphabetic scripts and in Egyptian hieroglyphs the name is written with an initial h.94 The evidence from the texts points to a wide diffusion of the cult over the whole region; often the storm-god stood at the top of the particular local pantheon, in local onomastics Addu is by far the most frequent or one of the most frequent theophoric elements. Important cult centres explicitly attested in the texts include ›alab, Kallassu, Alala¢ and Ugarit in North Syria,95 Qa††arà, Sè¢na (Subat-Enlil), Ka¢at, Nagar, Nawala, Andarig, Saggaràtum and Kulmis in Upper Mesopotamia,96 ›arràdum, Terqa, Appàn, Mari itself and a few more smaller cult places in Mari’s vicinity as well as Tuttul in the region of the Middle Euphrates.97 Other places, such as Syrian Qa†na,98 where important sanctuaries of the storm-god are mentioned

in texts of later periods, have been excluded from this list, though it is more than likely that the storm-god temples of these cities look back on a long tradition. For this period, we only have more detailed information about the cult of Addu and his position in the pantheon from Mari for the time being, where worship of Addu can be shown to have existed continually since the Early Dynastic period.99 Addu stands at the top of the Pantheon along with Dagàn and Itùrmèr, the local dynastic god. Rations for the temple of Addu in Mari are frequently attested in documents of the cult administration, without them revealing any more detail about the structure of the sanctuary. Dagàn and Addu were responsible for the enthronement of the king and were seen as the special protective deities of kingship. Among the priests of the temple there are some high-ranking individuals, like princess Inibsina, who has the title of “wife (implied meaning: high priestess) of Addu”.100 We do not know with certainty how the relationship between Dagàn and Addu was defined on the Middle Euphrates during the Old Babylonian period. Dagàn was regarded as the father of the gods par excellence. In the later Ugaritic myths the storm-god Baalu carries the petrified epithet “Son of Dagàn”, which must continue older North Syrian traditions, because on the level of mythological action hIlu was seen as the father of Baalu and the father of the younger generation of gods in general. The model for this filiation is surely the generational sequence Kumarbi—Tessub in Hurrian mythology, as Kumarbi was equated with Dagàn in Upper Mesopotamia and on the Middle Euphrates. Whether the thus indirectly implied filiation Dagàn—Addu can be assumed before the ‘Hurrianisation’ of Upper Mesopotamia that started in the late Old Babylonian period remains questionable.101 Explicit information about the filiation of Addu in Mari and in the Syro-Upper

102 See Wettergottgestalten, 298 (a seal from Mari) and 282 (a seal from Ugarit and an unprovenanced Syrian seal). 103 Note that I still find it very unlikely that the sequence (Dagàn), Bèl-màtim, nin¢ursagga (= Sàlas), (Bèlet-ekallim, Nikkal,) Bèl-Terqa in the sections of the Mari ‘panthea’ referring to Terqa is to be interpreted (Dagàn), Addu (= Bèl-màtim), Sàlas, ( . . .), Dagàn (= Bèl-Terqa). It would be very unusual structurally to have the son in the first position, followed by his father’s wife, and the father only in the third position. It seems much more natural to assume that both, Bèl-màtim and Bèl-Terqa, are forms of Dagàn (god of the land and of the city), the more universal aspect of Dagàn being named first, followed as usual by the spouse, and in third position the local city-god. The whole section would then be concerned only with Dagàn and his circle (see Wettergottgestalten, 277 fn. 1911 contra J.-M. Durand, La religión en Siria durante la época de los reinos amorreos según la documentación de Mari, MROA II/1, Sabadell 1995, 172ff., Pompoinio—Xella, Dieux d’Ebla, 98f., and, more recently, Feliu, Dagan, 58f., 88f. and Rouault, Hethitica 15 (2002) 222224 with fn. 33). 104 Possibly forms of Istar, whatever that may imply in concrete terms. 105 For the consorts of Addu in Sè¢na, Nagar and Qa††arà see Wettergottgestalten, 271f., 273f. (for A. 2945 see now FM 8, text 3), 268f., for the imperial pantheon of Mittani see ibid., 460f., for Istar-Sawuska as consort of the storm-gods in Nuzi, ›ilmani, Ulamme and Tilla ibid., 464-466, for the combination of Adad and Istar in Neo-Assyrian penalty clauses ibid., 598-600.
Mesopotamian area generally is only given by seal inscriptions, which call Anu the father of Addu in agreement with the tradition already dominant in Babylonia in the Old Babylonian period.102 Given that inscriptions on seals are heavily formalised, their evidence does not carry too much weight, but they do caution against taking a filiation Dagàn—Addu for granted during the period of the Mari archives, before this hypothesis can be based on more solid evidence.103 The question of who was venerated as consort of Addu in Mari cannot be answered definitely either. Given the close contacts to Aleppo and a few other indicators we can probably assume that in Mari, too, ›èbat stood at Addu’s side. This, however, cannot be taken for granted a priori, because in other cities of Upper Mesopotamia during the Old Babylonian period local city goddesses104 were worshipped at the storm-god’s side, thus presumably in Sè¢na, Nagar, perhaps also in Qa††arà. One should also bear in mind the later combination of Istar and the storm-god in the East Tigris area, possibly also in the official pantheon of the Mittani empire, a tradition traces of which are still noticeable in NeoAssyrian penalty clauses.105 Very little is known about the cult calendar at the Addu sanctuary of Mari; special rituals for Addu could be carried out before

the harvest to prevent storm-damage, as this is attested for so many other periods and regions of the ancient Near East.106 The zukrumrite to be performed for Addu that is mentioned in the Mari letter A. 1121+ refers, as convincingly argued by D. Fleming, probably not to a festival at one of Addu’s major temples (be it Aleppo, Kallassu or Mari), but to a ceremony performed outside Mari within a tribal context for which funding is requested from Zimrì-Lìm.107
4.3.3 Haddu, Tessub and Baalu: The Second Half of the Second Millennium
The political and cultural character of Syria and Upper Mesopotamia changed profoundly in the late Old Babylonian period. Hurrian princedoms, known since the Ur III period, superseded the Amorite ruling houses on a broad front until the rise of the Mittanian empire with its Hurrian character. The kingdom of Yam¢ad with its capital ›alab became ever more politically insignificant and large parts of northern Syria came under Hittite rule. For the first time in history sources are available for the Syro-Palestinian area (‘Canaan’) that throw light on the worship of Haddu in this region, which was characterised by previously unattested languages, various ‘Canaanite’ dialects and Ugaritic. This complex cultural situation is reflected, not least, in developments in the history of religion and particularly in those connected with the cult of the various storm-gods venerated in this region. Canaanite-Ugaritic, Old Syrian-Amorite, Hurrian, AssyroBabylonian and Hittite-Luwian traditions, too, are found in combination and parallel to each other. Without exception the different storm-gods that stem from the afore-mentioned traditions are equated with each other in Late Bronze age Syria and Upper Mesopotamia; mutual influences between the different traditions associated with the individual storm-gods are a necessary consequence without the different names, myths and cult traditions ever being systematically bound into a unitary syncretistic theological construct anywhere. If

phonetic complements do not advise against this, it is recommendable for practical reasons to read the generally Sumerographic writings for a particular storm-god in a given text according to the respective linguistic context; hybrid formations like E¢li-Addu or IkùnTessub, which contradict this basic principle, do however occur in the onomastica. The old centres of the Haddu-cult in Syria, Upper Mesopotamia and on the Middle Euphrates, as they are known from the Old Babylonian period, still exist in Hurrian garb as temples of Tessub. But even during the period of the Mittanian Empire and the Hittite domination of North Syria large parts of the population spoke Semitic idioms so that the inherited name Haddu (Hadda) never disappeared, but continued being used next to Tessub. At the same time, firstly along the Syro-Palestinian coastal strip, baalu, originally an epithet of the storm-god, came to be established as the proper name of the Syrian storm-god (Baalu, Baaal), a development that sent waves far into the hinterland. This complex situation is most apparent in the texts from Emar on the Middle Euphrates (14th13th cent.), which clearly show that the scribes there wrote the names Haddu and Baalu both with the Sumerogram diSkur.108 Given that Emar served as a Hittite garrison, Hittite-Luwian cults were introduced in the city and Hurrian traditions are still observable in the onomasticon, too. Contacts with Assyria and Babylonia were a matter of course in a city on the Euphrates. The multiplicity of traditions connected with the storm-god can be appreciated from a view of the different representations of the storm-god attested on cylinder seals from this city, which are now available in a comprehensive edition by D. Beyer that includes an in-depth discussion of the various iconographic traditions in the depiction of the storm-god as they appear on the Emar seals.109 Since the most important groups of texts for the religious historical developments of this era are not primarily associated with the name Haddu, but with Baalu and Tessub, they will be dealt with here in sections 5. and 6.

4.3.4 Aramaean Hadad, Assyrian Adad and Luwian Tar¢unza: The First Millennium
From the beginning of the 1st mill. clear regional and cultural differences in the nomenclature of the storm-god become apparent once more. While the name Baaal continued to be used in the coastal strip of Palestine, Syria and Southern Anatolia, the old name Hadda/u, became predominant in Aramaean Syria and Upper Mesopotamia. It is much attested in the Aramaic onomasticon in this form (hd, d, but also hdd),110 but was generally realised as Hadad under Assyrian influence (< Adad) outside of the onomastics.111 Among Aramaic and Neo-Assyrian personal names variant forms like Dadda (Daddi etc.) occur, which are rendered logographically as du.u, a writing not attested before the Neo-Assyrian period.112 In Aramaean Damascus—and possibly in other places too—Rammàn served as an epithet of the local Hadad.113 In Luwian inscriptions of the same period the storm-god was called Tar¢unza; he often has the epithet “of heaven” (cf. 6.4 on Baaalsamêm, and 7.1 on the name of the Hittite-Luwian storm-god). Hadad was among the most important gods both of the Aramaean pantheon and within the Hittite-Luwian tradition. He was at the top of the hierarchy in numerous local panthea, where he was seen as divine king and as the god that bestowed kingship on the local ruler. Speculation about a connection between the wild bull as supposed totemic animal of the Aramaic tribes and the wild bull as symbolic animal of Hadad114 stands and falls solely with the etymology of Aram as “wild bull” for which conclusive arguments have still to be presented. Little is known about the circle of deities associated with Hadad, as no Aramaic mythological texts have survived. There is no evidence for the alleged syncretism between storm-god and moon-god in the textual record, and the iconographic evidence adduced for this development does not hold up

under closer scrutiny.115 In Guzana, which was under strong Assyrian influence, Hadad’s consort was called Sàla.116 The same must have been the case in many Upper Mesopotamian cities. In Karkamis, with its strong Luwian elements, ›èbat stood at Tar¢unza’s side.117 Her name does not occur in contemporary or later Aramaic inscriptions and seems to disappear completely from the record with the gradual weakening of Luwian traditions in 8th and 7th cent. Syria.118 In the Hellenistic-Roman period Astarte (Venus, as in Heliopolis) or Atargatis (as in Hierapolis) were called the consorts of Hadad (Zeus, Jupiter). Ugaritic Baalu had already been associated with aAΔtartu and aAnatu, but a differentiated picture of the complex developments associated with the consorts of Adad cannot currently be provided.119 Temples of Hadad (or Tar¢unza or Adad) in Upper Mesopotamia are attested for Guzana and Sikkàni, the latter possibly the same site as the old Mittanian capital Wassukkanni with its important Tessub temple,120 Urakka, Sabaha and a place in the vicinity of the modern village Anaz.121 In North Syria sanctuaries of the stormgod can be shown to have existed in Zincirli, Tell Tayinat (probably ancient Kinalua), ›alab,122 as well as in Turlu Höyük, Karkamis

The temple of the storm-god of ›alab, the history of which can now also be followed back into the Early Bronze Age archaeologically, stood throughout all eras of ancient Near Eastern history in a prominent position on the mound of the modern citadel of Aleppo. The thickness of the preserved wall foundations shows that the temple itself must have been a towering building which could be seen from afar in the plain around the city.126 In the written tradition the sanctuary is first attested in the preSargonic texts from Ebla as the most important temple of North

127 See Wettergottgestalten, 108-111 (cf. also supra, 4.3.1), but note that A. Archi, JNES 64 (2005) 85 apparently takes many of the attestations that in our opinion refer to Hadda’s temple in Ebla as referring to the temple in Aleppo. 128 The relevant texts have now been (re-)edited and discussed by J.-M Durand in FM 7. 129 I still cannot see anything out of the ordinary in the fact that the principal god of Yam¢ad is regarded as the god who bestows kingship and thereby assigns the respective territory to each given king (cf. Wettergottgestalten, 214 fn. 1477). The same is true for Dagàn of Tuttul in the 3rd mill. (cf. RIME 2.1.1.11: 14-28), for Marduk in the late 2nd and 1st mill. and for Sîn during the reign of Nabonidus (cf. P.-A. Beaulieu, The Reign of Nabonidus, YNER 10, New Haven—London 1989, 43-65, esp. 56f.). For the mythological motif of the storm-god’s victory over the sea that is used within this context see infra, 8. 130 See Wettergottgestalten, 211-214, where a reference to J. Sasson’s article on the usage of prophecies in political argumentation should be added (“The Posting of Letters with Divine Messages”, in: Florilegium marianum II. Recueil d’études à la mémoire de Maurice Birot, ed. D. Charpin—J.-M. Durand, Mémoires de NABU 3, Paris 1994, 299-316).
Syria with supra-regional significance. Already in this period the cult of Hadda of ›alab was not limited to Aleppo itself; temples of Hadda of Aleppo are encountered in other cities as far as Mari on the Middle Euphrates. The administrative texts from Ebla provide only very limited information on the cult of Hadda’s temple at Aleppo, but it seems that what little more is known about the practices at Ebla’s Hadda-temple is very much modeled on the more prominent sanctuary of the storm-god at Aleppo.127 After this, extensive source-material on the storm-god of Aleppo is only available in the Old Babylonian period, during which Aleppo was the royal residence of the powerful kingdom of Yam¢ad. From this period, too, no written sources from ›alab itself are available. Beside the texts from Alala¢, it is particularly texts from Mari, especially the correspondence of Zimrì-Lìm with Aleppo, which give us important information.128 Addu of ›alab was at the top of the pantheon of Yam¢ad, the king of Yam¢ad was the “beloved of Addu” and the land of Yam¢ad itself can simply be called the “Land of Addu”. The king acted politically and militarily according to the will of Addu, who was consequently supposed to be the one who had directed political events in the past.129 Within this ideology the initiation into kingship particularly was a privilege of the god, this too even with regard to kings under the patronage of Yam¢ad, like Zimrì-Lìm of Mari. In the discernment of divine will, and not least in the political argumentation as well, the oracle of Addu of ›alab played an important role.130

137 See Wettergottgestalten, 215-216, 217; the most important evidence for this concept, A. 1858, has now been edited as FM 7, text 5. 138 Contra Durand, FM 7, 3-7; see already Wettergottgestalten, 212 fn. 1467 (with previous literature) and Schwemer, AfO 50 (2003-2004) 412a.
The great eminence of Addu of ›alab and the political weight of the kingdom of Yam¢ad—the latter certainly reinforced the former—are also expressed in the fact that the ruler of Elam presented a bow as a votive gift to Addu of ›alab.131 Zimrì-Lìm of Mari dedicated among other things a statue of himself to Addu of ›alab,132 about the placing of which there were differences of opinion. The king of Mari demands that it be placed on the lap of the divine statue—thus obviously a seated image—, whereby he is picking up the well-known motif of the raising of the ruler in the lap of the divine king. Yarìm-Lìm of Yam¢ad replies that this position is already occupied by a statue. The fragmentary text appears to indicate that this was a statue of the sun-god.133 Why a statue of the sun-god might have been placed on the lap of the storm-god of Aleppo is not known. One would rather expect a subordinate son-deity on the lap of the main god.134 Yet there is nothing to support a filial relationship between Addu and a solar deity.135 Further speculation is prohibited in view of the fragmentary state of the text and the fact that the preserved dutu (the sun-god) could also be the second part of a personal name. In the Old Babylonian period too, the goddess ›èbat, attested already at Ebla (›a(l)abatu), was seen as the consort of Addu of ›alab. There is no evidence concerning the further court of the god.136 The arms of the victorious warrior, Addu, were worshipped as movable cult symbols and could be taken into battle as a kind of field-standard.137 There is no support, in my opinion, for any actual ‘temple asylum’ of the storm-god of Aleppo.138 It is likely

139 See Wettergottgestalten, 217f. with fn. 1510 on AlT *63 rev. 19ff. (the year date almost certainly refers to the storm-god of ›alab, not the storm-god of Alala¢). A ¢iyaru-festival of the storm-god, closely connected with the month name ›iyaru, is attested for Old Babylonian Tell Leilan (Wettergottgestalten, 252f.), Late Bronze Age Ugarit (ibid., 521f.), Emar (ibid., 559f., now also Fleming, Time at Emar, 168-173) and the cult of the storm-god of ›alab at ›attusa (Wettergottgestalten, 497f., cf. now also M. Hutter, “Das ¢iyara-Fest in ›attusa. Transformation und Funktion eines syrischen Festes”, in: Silva Anatolica. Studies M. Popko, ed. P. Taracha, Warsaw 2002, 187-196). This ¢iyaru-festival is not identical with the ¢ârum-rite (contra Durand, FM 7, 69, see already Wettergottgestalten, 217 fn. 1510, cf. also Fleming, Time at Emar, 172). Note that the original evidence for a connection between the ¢ârum-ritual and the ¢iyaru of the storm-god, namely the *anSe diSkur in ARM 26/1, 20 obv. 7 does not hold up against collation (see Durand, FM 7, p. 69). 140 See Wettergottgestalten, 301f. 141 See Wettergottgestalten, 490-494.

that one of the important festivals of Aleppo’s storm-god was celebrated in the month ›iyaru. The evidence for this ¢iyaru-festival, however, comes mainly from later periods and parallels in other places; but probably it is not due to chance that Niqmepu¢ of ›alab dedicates a statue of himself on the 26th of ›iyaru.139 As in previous periods the cult of Addu of ›alab spread far beyond ›alab itself. As shown by a list of oath-gods from Mari he was seen as the most important local storm-god of the ancient Near East beside the storm-god of Kumme (Tessub or Addu).140 Even the later dynasty of ›alab residing in Alala¢ worshipped Addu of ›alab as the highest god of the pantheon. In the inscription of Idrimi the storm-god has the unique epithet “lord of heaven and earth and of the great gods”.141 In the second half of the 2nd mill. the cult of the storm-god of Aleppo can be attested in all places where storm-gods occupy an important position in the pantheon, as in Nuzi to the east of the Tigris, in Ugarit on the Syrian Mediterranean coast (where he is already attested in the Old Babylonian period), in Tunip, Emar, in various places in Anatolia, not least in ›attusa itself.142 In all these places the god was addressed by the name that was the usual name of the storm-god in each cultural context (Addu, Adad, Baalu, Tessub). By what name he was addressed in his home sanctuary can only be surmised with difficulty. The princes of Alala¢ will have been following an old tradition when they used the name Addu (or Haddu), but at the same time an increasing Hurrian influence has to be factored in,

which at least led to the fact that the cult of the storm-god of ›alab at ›attusa, already well-attested in the 15th cent., is essentially characterised by Hurrian tradition.143 Exactly how and when the cult of the storm-god of Aleppo was adopted at ›attusa cannot yet be reconstructed in detail on the basis of the available sources. The so-called Pu¢ànu chronicle suggests that the cult of the storm-god of ›alab had already been introduced at the time of ›attusili I in connection with this king’s campaigns in northern Syria.144 From Tud¢aliya I on we can observe the proper integration of the god into the Hittite imperial pantheon; the golden age of the cult can be dated to the Empire Period. Muwatalli II undertook a re-organisation of the festivals of the storm-god of ›alab, who was by now also called storm-god of ›alab of ›atti (resp. ›attusa). His son Mursili III obviously worshipped the storm-god of ›alab, among others, as his personal protective deity.145 The cultic calendar of the temple of the storm-god of ›alab in ›attusa comprehended 13 special festivals beside the regular rites, and the temple was also visited by the king as part of the Spring and Autumn festivals, which spread over many days. It has not yet been possible to localise the temple with any certainty in the archaeological remains.146 According to the kaluti-list the circle of deities associated with Tessub of ›alab in ›attusa included Anatolian deities beside the Syro-Hurrian ones. It is not clear how far these circumstances can be transferred to the sanctuary at ›alab itself. ›alab, which was a Hittite vice-regency from

Suppiluliuma I on, must have been exposed to considerable Hittite influence, especially since the significance of ›alab was primarily religious, while the political centre of power lay in Karkamis. The end of Hittite rule in North Syria does not appear to have hindered the continuity of the cult in ›alab. The temple was renovated, presumably around 1100, by a prince by the name of Taita, whose Hieroglyphic Luwian inscription for Tar¢unza of ›alab was found in a central position in the temple itself.147 He obviously ruled over a significant territory in northern Syria, including Aleppo (Wadasatini). It has not yet been possible to place other Hieroglyphic Luwian inscriptions, such as the Babylon-Stele and Babylon-bowls, which in all probability originally come from the Aleppo sanctuary, precisely in history. According to the excavated remains, the early Iron-Age temple was destroyed not long after 900 and apparently was not re-built on the same spot. However, later Hieroglyphic Luwian and Aramaic inscriptions from northern Syria (Körkün, Sfire)148 show that there must have been a new temple building, presumably not far from the older building on the citadel, where one would then also look for the Hellenistic temple of Zeus. It is not known whether it was already an Aramaean prince of Arpad who was responsible for this restoration of the temple. The supraregional significance of the sanctuary is documented in this era primarily by the sacrifices that Shalmaneser III offers in Aleppo, as well as the fact that according to the so-called ‘Götteradressbuch’ the city of Assur had a shrine of Adad of Aleppo at least in the Neo-Assyrian period.149 In the Hieroglyphic Luwian inscriptions the storm-god of ›alab is called Tar¢unza, as one would expect, in the Aramaic ones he is Hadad and in the Assyrian and Baylonian 1st mill. texts he is referred to as Adad. The name Tessub was no longer used as normal name for the North Syrian storm-god, but lived on as the name of a subordinate god, separate from Tar¢unza, at least in Til Barsip (Tell Ahmar 1 and 6) and, as the onomasticon informs

us, presumably also in Karkamis. Whether the mention of an Adad of ›allab (diSkur ¢al-lab) in a document of the Persian period from Borsippa is really connected to the storm-god of North Syrian ›alab150 is extremely questionable; one would rather opt for the North Babylonian ›allab.

THE STORM-GODS OF THE ANCIENT NEAR EAST: SUMMARY, SYNTHESIS, RECENT STUDIES
PART II
DANIEL SCHWEMER
Abstract
In many regions of the ancient Near East, not least in Upper Mesopotamia, Syria and Anatolia where agriculture relied mainly on rainfall, storm-gods ranked among the most prominent gods in the local panthea or were even regarded as divine kings, ruling over the gods and bestowing kingship on the human ruler. While the Babylonian and Assyrian storm-god never held the highest position among the gods, he too belongs to the group of ‘great gods’ through most periods of Mesopotamian history. Given the many cultural contacts and the longevity of traditions in the ancient Near East only a study that takes into account all relevant periods, regions and text-groups can further our understanding of the different ancient Near Eastern storm-gods. The study Wettergottgestalten Mesopotamiens und Nordsyriens by the present author (2001) tried to tackle the problems involved, basing itself primarily on the textual record and excluding the genuinely Anatolian storm-gods from the study. Given the lack of handbooks, concordances and thesauri in our field, the book is necessarily heavily burdened with materials collected for the first time. Despite comprehensive indices, the long lists and footnotes as well as the lack of an overall synthesis make the study not easily accessible, especially outside the German-speaking community. In 2003 Alberto Green published a comprehensive monograph entitled The Storm-God in the Ancient Near East whose aims are more ambitious than those of Wettergottgestalten: All regions of the ancient Near East—including a chapter on Yahwe as a storm-god—are taken into account, and both textual and iconographic sources are given equal space. Unfortunately this book, which was apparently finished and submitted to the publisher before Wettergottgestalten came to its author’s attention, suffers from some serious flaws with regard to methodology, philology and the interpretation of texts and images. In presenting the following succinct overview I take the opportunity to make up for the missing synthesis in Wettergottgestalten and to provide some additions and corrections where necessary. It is hoped that this synthesis can also serve as a response to the history of ancient Near Eastern storm-gods as outlined by A. Green.

5. Tessub, the Hurrian King of the Gods
5.1 Name and Early History
The name of the Hurrian storm-god, Tessub, which should strictly be written Tessob according to the orthography of the Mittani letter (the variant form Tessoba occurs in the onomasticon), is without etymology, but may well be genuinely Hurrian. Tessub is attested first in Hurrian personal names of the Ur III and Old Babylonian periods. The first attestation for the storm-god himself occurs in the Hurrian inscription of Tis-Atal of Urkes (Ur III period), where the name of the god is already written logographically (dISKUR). Nothing is known about the history of the god before Hurrian dynasties established themselves in the Upper Mesopotamian area. Tessub certainly belongs to the old Hurrian pantheon and shares his roots with the Urartian storm-god Teiseba, who is only attested in the 1st mill. Tessub was presumably at the head of the Hurrian pantheon from time immemorial as divine king. The assumption that his position of divine king accrued to him only via syncretism with Upper Mesopotamian Haddu, remains without convincing proof. The fact that Teiseba only has the second rung in the Urartian pantheon after ›aldi results from secondary developments (Wettergottgestalten, 444-446).
5.2 Diffusion of the Cult
The main cult centre of Tessub was Kumme, which presumably lies in the valley of the Eastern ›abur. The name Kumme may perhaps be interpreted as originally Hurrian (in Akkadian then Kummu(m), in Hittite Kummiya), which would speak for an originally Hurrian character of the sanctuary. The sanctuary can be attested in the sources from the Old Babylonian to the Neo-Assyrian period and enjoyed a transregional significance similar to that of the temple of the storm-god of Aleppo.1 The storm-god sanctuary of East Tigridian Arrap¢e (Arrap¢um) is attested from the Old Babylonian period, too, and probably also had a Hurrian character even before the 15th cent.2 With the increased establishment of



4 daniel schwemer
Hurrian dynasties and finally the rise of the Empire of Mittani in the Upper Mesopotamian-North Syrian area, the cult of Tessub also spread and connected with traditions associated of old with the Semitic storm-god, Addu. Due to the lack of sources, however, it is not yet even possible to trace the developments via local case studies in any detail. The most important temples of Tessub within the realm of the Mittani empire were those of the cities Ka¢at, Wassukkanni, U¢us(u)màn(i) and Irride.3 A few traces of the short-lived Hurro-Mittanian rule over Assyria are still visible in the traditions associated with Adad in the NeoAssyrian period,4 but more importantly Hurrian cultural influence extended as far as southern Anatolia and reached—mainly via Kizzuwatna—the Hittite royal family, so that significant elements, motifs and texts of Syro-Hurrian origin are identifiable in the Hittite cult from the Middle Hittite period on. The Hittite storm-god was identified with Tessub in the process; relevant religious texts (myths, hymns, prayers) were adopted and partially translated into Hittite, the name of Tessub being replaced by that of the Hittite stormgod in these cases. The Syro-Hurrian pantheon with Tessub and ›èbat at its top formed an important element of the cult.5 Almost all texts providing information on the ideas associated with Tessub have been transmitted to us by Hittite scribes, be it in Hittite or Hurrian. All these texts were already the result of a comprehensive fusion of originally Syrian and Hurrian traditions, each of which was in early contact with the Assyro-Babylonian world too.
5.3 Tessub as Head of the Imperial Pantheon of Mittani
According to the few sources at our disposal (mainly the Mittani dossier in the Amarna correspondence) Tessub was at the top of the official pantheon of the Mittani Empire. Nearest in rank to him was the goddess (Istar-)Sawuska. What relationship these two divinities had to each other, is not quite clear. In the Hurrian myths and rituals known to us from ›attusa the North-Syrian ›èbat is always
3 These are the local forms of Tessub mentioned in the god list of the Sattiwaza treaty, see Wettergottgestalten, 461f.; a few more storm-god sanctuaries in what must have been cities belonging to Mittani are attested in Middle Assyrian sources (Sura, Isana, see Wettergottgestalten, 577f.). 4 See Wettergottgestalten, 482 on Sèri(s) and ›urri in Assyrian sources.

the storm-gods of the ancient near east 5
the wife, Sawuska on the other hand the sister of the storm-god. This Syro-Hurrian tradition can, however, hardly be an originally Hurrian concept. Conspicuously, forms of Sawuska were often worshipped at the side of Tessub in the area east of the Tigris which lay under Hurrian influence, and even in Old Babylonian Upper Mesopotamia, forms of Istar appear to have been worshipped at the side of the storm-god, albeit without Istar-Sawuska being explicitly labelled the consort of Tessub. How the relationship between Tessub and Sawuska was conceptualised in the imperial pantheon of Mittani is not discernable from the available sources. The goddess ›èbat was surely not unknown, as Mittanian princesses have her in their names. Thus one cannot exclude that the Syro-Hurrian tradition also prevailed in the imperial pantheon of Mittani (see Wettergottgestalten, 460-462).
5.4 Modus Operandi and Circle of Deities Associated with Tessub
The best known group of myths that feature Tessub as their protagonist is the so-called ‘Kumarbi-cycle’. Only fragmentarily preserved myths from this cycle are known, exclusively on manuscripts from ›attusa, most of them Hittite translations which also translate the individual divine names into Hittite. Beside this there are also a few fragments of Hurrian versions. The whole mythic complex treats essentially one theme: the conflict between the younger divine king Tessub and his deposed father, Kumarbi, who tries by various tricks to regain the kingship over the gods. The divine kingdom is set in heaven and presided over first by the primeval god, Alalu. He is then driven out by his son, the sky-god, Anu, who himself is deposed by Kumarbi, a god of the same generation as Anu. In the struggle Kumarbi bites Anu’s genitals off and thus carries the seed of powerful gods, including Tessub, within him. These are then ‘born’ from him and defeat him, and so Tessub becomes the new king of the gods. Tessub’s earthly home is also the town of Kumme6 in the myth, and his cosmic sphere of activities are heaven and the land. Particularly the underworld and the sea are foreign and hostile regions to him. In alliance primarily with the deities and monsters of the sea and the underworld—including a stone giant with the programmatic name Ullikummi “Destroy Kumme”Kumarbi, who was himself ascribed chthonic characteristics as a god
6 For Tessub as lord of Kumme see Wettergottgestalten, 456-458.



6 daniel schwemer
of cereals and as the disposessed, old king of the gods, attempts to win back the divine kingship in heaven. The narrative cycle receives suspense from the fact that Kumarbi’s plans are in the short term almost successful, until Tessub finally manages to narrowly defeat his various opponents. The cycle perhaps ended with a struggle between Tessub and the sea-god, who may have been allied to Kumarbi, from which Tessub definitively emerges as the victorious king of the gods (for the motif of the storm-god’s victory over the sea, cf. also 8.).7 The group of deities associated with Tessub according to the Kumarbi-cycle corresponds broadly to that known from other religious texts of Hurrian provenance: He was a son of Anu and Kumarbi; a Hurrian invocation labels Kumarbi as Tessub’s “mother” in harmony with the ‘Song of Kingship in Heaven’ from the Kumarbi-cycle. In KUB 33, 89+: 6' Tessub is apparently called a son of the moon-god, but this attestation is still isolated and its significance remains unclear for the time being. Brother and sister of Tessub were Sawuska and Tasmisu (Hittite Suwaliyatt); the latter is is also called Tessub’s vizier—a position which is occupied by the god Tènu in the ritual texts, perhaps following an Aleppine traditon.8 The chariot of Tessub was pulled by two divine bulls, as frequently attested in Hittite and North-Syrian art. In the Song of Ullikummi these bulls are called Sèrisu and Tilla. But most frequently it is ›urri (older ›urra), also a divine bull, who stands beside Sèri(s), not Tilla, who is attested as an important independent god in the region of Nuzi in the 15th cent.

independently acting god, but mainly as the mediator between humans and his lord Tessub, ›urri is only mentioned at the side of Sèri(s) and had—as far as we know—no distinct profile.9 Two further side-kicks of Tessub were the mountain-gods ›azzi (Cassius) and Nanni (Anti-Cassius?); they play no role in the Kumarbi-cycle, but are often named in the offering lists directly after Sèri(s) and ›urri.10 Otherwise, the South-Anatolian bull- and mountain-god Sarrumma, who occupied an important position in the Hittite pantheon of the 13th cent., was known as the son of Tessub and ›èbat. Unclear remains the relationship of the divine bulls Tilla, Sèri(s), ›urri and Sarrumma to the divine bull-calf Bùru, who is subordinate to Adad primarily in the Aramaean milieu of the Neo-Assyrian and Late Babylonian periods; whether this bull-god Bùru was somehow related to the god Apladad, the Adad-son of 1st mill. Aramaean religion (cf. 4.2.3), is unknown too.11 The narratives of the multi-tablet series “Release”, which have been preserved in a bilingual, Hurrian-Hittite version, are fraught with numerous difficulties of interpretation due to their overall very fragmentary state of preservation.12 Here, too, Tessub appears as lord of the gods. The beginning of the proemium refers directly to Tessub as lord of Kumme. In one episode Tessub demands the release of prisoners from Megi, the ruler of Ebla, and threatens otherwise the destruction of the city. The city-elders respond to this approach in the form of ironic questions, saying that it is quite improbable that the powerful Tessub would have solidarity with the prisoners.13 In another episode Tessub is a guest in the underworld, where the goddess of the underworld receives him with a celebration. Whether this episode ends in an imprisonment of Tessub in the underworld and how such an imprisonment of Tessub in the underworld is connected to the argument with the demand for the release of the prisoners in Ebla must remain open questions for the moment. It is even less sure whether some temporary

imprisonment of Tessub in the underworld should be put in the context of the conflict between Kumarbi and Tessub known from the Kumarbi-cycle, or, for that matter, in the context of Baalu’s dying and rising in the Ugaritic Baalu-cycle. At any rate it emerges clearly from the bilingual, too, that the underworld did not belong to the proper domain of Tessub. He dines there according to the Allani-episode beside the primordial gods who he himself had once banished to the underworld.14
6. Baa lu: The Storm-God as Lord of the Gods
6.1 The Epithet baa lu, “lord”, as Divine Name
The use of the epithet bèlu, baalu “lord” as the proper name of a particular god is attested for different gods in various epochs of the ancient Near East. Either these are abbreviations of the frequently occurring type of epithet, connected with all sorts of gods, “lord of (place-name)”, or it is the labelling of particular gods as lord (of the gods) par excellence (like Bèl for Marduk). Even the endingless form Baaal is already attested in the Early Dynastic period (god-list from Tell Abù Íalàbì¢). In the pre-Sargonic calendars of Ebla and Tell Beydar there is a month-name named after a god only referred to as Baalu or Bèlu (dbe-lí). In Tell Beydar this god also occurs in the name of a gate.15 Which god is hidden behind these epithets is not easy to decide. In view of the fact that the ‘New Calendar’ from Ebla had a month of Hadda beside the month of Baalu and that otherwise no recognisable connections between Hadda and the appellation Baalu (Baaal ) from this period exist, a simple equation of this “Lord” with the Late Bronze Age storm-god Baalu is out of the question. The element baalu in Ebla onomastics and similarly in later Amorite onomastics should be understood as an epithet and address form that can stand for different deities, not as an actual name of a single god. It appears therefore unlikely that Baalu as found in the Early Dynastic texts from Ebla, Tell Beydar and Tell Abù Íalàbì¢ represents the immediate precursor of the stormgod Baalu of late 2nd and 1st mill. Syria. The overall evidence rather points to Baalu developing in the course of the late 16th and

15th centuries on the Syro-Palestinian coastal strip from an epithet of the storm-god Haddu to his primary name, independently from the gods called Baalu or Baaal about a thousand years earlier. Conversely Haddu serves as an epithet of Baalu in Ugaritic mythology. Particularly telling in this regard are not only the cuneiform sources from Syro-Palestine itself (mainly the Amarna-Correspondence and texts from Tell Taaanakh),16 but also the rendering of the name of the Syrian storm-god in contemporary Egyptian sources. The theological background for this development may well have been the prominent position of the god Haddu in the panthea of SyroPalestine, which had him as the lord (of gods) per se.17 The use of the name Baalu then spread in the 14th and 13th centuries as far as Emar on the Middle Euphrates without ever fully replacing Adad (Addu) as the storm-god’s name (infra, 6.3). Further East the usage of the name Baalu was never adopted.
6.2 Baa lu of Ugarit
Thanks to the texts found in the city of Ugarit we are by far best informed about the storm-god Baalu (Haddu) worshipped in the city of Ugarit. But the abundance of information available for Baalu of Ugarit and Baalu of Mt. Íapuna (›azzi, Zaphon, Cassius, modern ]ebel al-Aqraa) should not distract from the fact that the texts from Ugarit represent the tradition of only one of the most important city-centres of Late Bronze Age Syro-Palestine. We know almost nothing of the myths and cults of the later Phoenician cities of Byblos, Sidon and Tyre or of the land of Amurru. On the other hand one has to take into account that especially the cult of Baalu Íapuna had trans-regional significance.

6.2.1 Position in the Pantheon of the City
Baalu embodies the type of young king of the gods who attains the worthiness of kingship among the gods by struggle, but who remains at the same time in principle subordinated to his father hIlu, the inactive father of the gods who is dependent on the deeds of his son (cf. e.g. the relationship between Ninurta and Enlil in Nippur). Both gods stood with their different functions together at the top of the local pantheon and were addressed by the kings as the main gods of the city (cf. CAT 1.14 obv. II 22ff.). The special role of the young king of the gods, Baalu, is that of representing the interests of the earthly king before the divine father (cf. CAT 1.15 obv. II 11ff.). The close relationship between the human king and his divine counterpart is also illustrated by the fact that the mythological episodes dealing with the burial of Baalu resemble rites performed at the burial of Ugaritic kings.18 Baalu’s position at the top of the city’s pantheon is clearly reflected by the numerous personal names formed with his name.19 The two temples on the acropolis of Ugarit surely are the sanctuaries of hIlu and Baalu. It was probably aAmmu-ràpi of Ugarit who renovated the temple of Baalu and sent a message to Egypt requiring craftsmen for his work on the building and a votive statue of the Egyptian king.20 Baalu consequently usually occupies the first rank among the younger gods in the offering lists of Ugaritic rituals, while the older gods hIluhibi, hIlu and Dagàn precede him. The cult distinguishes between Baalu of the city of Ugarit and Baalu of Mt. Íapuna. It is unsure whether both possessed a sanctuary. Probably the main temple of Baalu on the acropolis could also be called the temple of Baalu Íapuna, as the mythical home of Baalu (of Ugarit) was definitely

The reading of the name ΔrΔy (CAT 1.148 rev. 28) has now become clear. The syllabic parallel text RS 92.2004 has dsar-ra-si-ia (see D. Arnaud, “Textes administratifs”, in: Études Ougaritiques I.

Note that there is no “storm-god of sarrassiya” as implied by D. Arnaud, loc. cit., 325. Whether Sarrassiya himself had attributes of a storm-god we do not know; he certainly his a personification of one of the basic motifs of the Syro-Hurrian storm-god’s mythology.

meant to be Mt. Íapuna. If both Baalu manifestations were named beside each other, Baalu Íapuna had rank over Baalu of the city Ugarit.21 Baalu of ›alab too was worshipped at Ugarit. He is the highest-ranking storm-god to receive sacrifices during the ¢iyaru-ritual at Ugarit, named before Baalu of Mt. Íapuna. Both storm-gods receive a bull and a sheep on this occasion, an honour they share with only one other god in the list: the god Sarrassiya (ΔrΔy, dsarra-si-ia)22 named directly after the two storm-gods. This god is so far not attested otherwise, but there can be little doubt that he is a personification of Hurrian sarrasse- “kingship”, a term that is frequently used—in the Hurrian essive case—as ‘offering term’ in Hurro-Hittite rituals: sarrassiya “for kingship”.23 It is apparently this ‘offering term’ in its typical form that was personified and turned into a deity of its own. The sacrifices to this deity directly after the two storm-gods seem to suggest that the ¢iyaru-festival at Ugarit was especially performed with regard to (the Aleppine) Baalu’s kingship over the gods.
6.2.2 The Mythological Texts
A group of fragmentary mythological texts in the Ugaritic language, the so-called ‘Baalu-cycle’, is concerned with the struggles of Baalu for kingship among the gods. His rivals in this struggle all come from the younger generation of gods, while the father of the gods,



24 See D.M. Clemens, UF 33 (2001, publ. 2002) 65-116 (cf. 6.2.1). For the description of Baalu in the difficult text CAT 1.101 cf. also infra, 10. 25 For the storm-god’s role in the Ugaritic (and Canaanite) mythological texts see Wettergottgestalten, 532-542; for the myth of Baalu’s dying and rising and the motif of dying and rising gods generally see now T.N.D. Mettingers comprehensive study The Riddle of Resurrection. “Dying and Rising Gods” in the Ancient Near East, Stockholm 2001, which unfortunately appeared only after Wettergottgestalten had gone to press.

hIlu, essentially watches the struggles among the younger generation, without his own position being put in question by this. The fact alone, however, that Baalu has to fight against other rivals for the kingship, which office is finally approved by hIlu, suggests a certain tension between the father of the gods and the storm-god, which reminds one slightly of the configuration of the conflict between Kumarbi and Tessub. In the Ugaritic myth, too, the seagod (Yammu) is a main enemy of the storm-god. hIlu installs Yammu as king for unknown reasons and subordinates Baalu to him. Baalu defeats Yammu in battle and thus secures the kingship for himself (cf. infra, 8.). Here begins the second large part of the Baalu-cycle, which is devoted to the building of a palace and the associated definitive confirmation of Baalu’s kingship by hIlu. The third large narrative of the Baalu-cycle describes the defeat of the storm-god at the hands of the god of death, Môtu. Baalu is buried and must descend into the underworld powerless. He dies and takes the storms and rains with him. The scene of Baalu’s burial is only briefly referred to in the Baalu-cycle itself, but other excerpts from mythological texts seem to indicate that fuller descriptions of the treatment of the deceased Baalu existed.24 Only after Baalu’s sister aAnatu has destroyed Môtu, does Baalu re-emerge from the underworld with his abundance. The cyclical plot of the story suggests a seasonal interpretation. During the winter rain-period Baalu is among people and in heaven, the summer dry-season is brought about by his sojourn in the world of the dead. Parts of the text indicate that the myth concerns disastrous droughts occurring at long intervals, but of course even such disasters basically move within the basic seasonal framework. In contrast to the myth about Baalu and Yammu, the story about Baalu and Môtu cannot be connected with earlier material associated with Haddu, Tessub or Iskur-Adad (but cf. supra, 3.4 and 5.4). Rather this part of the Baalu-cycle shows a relationship with myths about other dying and returning vegetation gods (esp. Dumuzi-Tammuz and Adonis).25 But similar stories about

the storm-god’s defeat and imprisonment in the underworld formed part of other contemporary Canaanite myths too, as the ‘Elkunirsamyth’ shows. The last passage of this myth that is only preserved in Hittite translation relates how an injured Baalu is treated, “recreated” (appa samnai-) by the birth goddesses and exorcised by a number of exorcists. It seems that the storm-god had been forced to the underworld too, but on the whole the text is much too fragmentary to allow far-reaching interpretations.26 It should be noted, however, that the motif of disappearing gods in genuinely Anatolian mythology (Telipinu myth etc.) is in various aspects significantly different from the Ugaritic Baalu-myth; it seems unlikely, also with regard to the general lack of Hittite influences in Syro-Mesopotamian mythology, that these Anatolian myths and rituals served as a model of the story about Baalu’s death and return.27 Not explicitly attested in the texts is the worship of Baalu as protective deity of sea-faring. The great significance of sea-trade for the city of Ugarit, the role of Baalu as victor over Yammu and the monsters of the sea, the discovery of stone anchors as votive gifts in the area of the Baalu temple (as in other sanctuaries on the SyroPalestinian coast too),28 as well as the probable function of the Baalu temple which rises high above the city as an orientation point (and light-house?) for sailors make it plausible, however, that Baalu was ascribed this function too.29 As a young god, Baalu did not have a consort in a real sense. The mythological texts, however, appear to describe sexual encounters both with aAΔtartu and with Baalu’s sister aAnatu. In the HellenisticRoman period Astarte and Atargatis, presumably a syncretism of aAΔtartu and aAnatu, were worshipped as consorts of the Syrian storm-gods. Neither aAnatu nor aAΔtartu, however, are named as mothers of Baalu’s three daughters, Pidray, Arßay and ˇallay. Pidray

Tessub as son of Kumarbi, who is equated with Dagàn, see supra, 4.3.2. 32 See Wettergottgestalten, 548-552; for the depiction of the storm-god on the Emar seals and the various traditions apparent in the different styles that can be observed see D.

Proceedings of the 42th RAI (OLA 96), ed. K. van LerbergheG. Voet, Leuven 1999, 145-67. 34 In principle one cannot exclude that ›èbat was regarded as Baalu’s regular consort and Astartu as his mistress (cf. the relationship between Nabû, Tasmètu and Nanaya in 1st mill. Borsippa), but we have not enough evidence for any conclusions of this kind.

herself is equated with ›èbat, the North-Syrian consort of Tessubthis too being an indication that the Ugaritic Baalu did not have a wife in any real sense.30 hIlu is named as the father of Baalu throughout. Only in two frozen epithets Baalu is also called “Son of Dagàn”, following an older Syro-Hurrian tradition.31 On the level of myth, Dagàn does not play a role and appears to have been completely absorbed by Ugaritic hIlu.
6.3 Baa lu (Addu) at Emar and Other Cities on the Middle Euphrates
In the 14th and 13th centuries the use of the name Baalu spread as far as Emar on the Middle Euphrates (and places in its vicinity), where the names Addu, Baalu and Tessub were used beside each other depending on the linguistic context—a situation that is also reflected in the contemporary glyptic.32 Unfortunately almost nothing is known about the mythology of the storm-god at Late Bronze Age Emar, and we get only little insight into how the different traditions connected with Addu, Tessub and Baalu coexisted or were blended in this area. Traditionally Baalu (Addu), “the lord of Imar”, seems to have been the most important god of the city ranking only after the more senior Dagàn, while the citygod ninurta33 receives the position after the storm-god in the offering lists. Probably ›èbat was worshipped as consort of the storm-god, and while Astartu had a high rank in the local pantheon as well, claims that she was worshipped as Baalu’s consort are based on little evidence. Possibly her relationship can be compared to that between Addu (Tessub) and Istar (Sawuska) in the Old Babylonian period and in the 16th and 15th cent.34 The installation ritual for Baalu’s high priestess is preserved in three versions, and other texts

6.4 Baaal and Baaalsamêm in the First Millennium
The use of the original epithet Baalu as personal name of the Semitic storm-god, Haddu, as primarily attested in texts from Ugarit for the Late Bronze Age, continued without interruption in the Iron Age cultures of Syro-Palestine and South Anatolia. The storm-god is always called Baaal in Phoenician texts; the ‘Canaanite’ stormgod is also called Baaal in the Old Testament.36 By contrast the inherited Semitic name of the storm-god lived on in the form Hadad (Hadda) in the Aramaean dominated interior of Syria and in Upper Mesopotamia (see 4.3.4). Of course the name Baaal did not always stand for a storm-god, for, as in earlier periods, particularly in connection with a place-name it could serve as an independent epithet of a local leading deity of any kind. In those regions which were in contact with Babylonia, Bèl(-Marduk) was then appropriated and fused with the Syrian Baaal (cf. the god Bel [< Bol] in Palmyra).37 The storm-god was always and everywhere considered as one of the sky-gods per se. The most important manifestation of the Hittite Tar¢un(t) was regularly called “storm-god of heaven” (from the Old Hittite period; similarly to be assumed for Hattic Taru). Already from the Old Babylonian period the same epithet “of heaven” can be attested on the Middle Euphrates and in the Upper MesopotamianAssyrian area for Haddu or Adad (similarly for other sky-gods: Sîn, Samas, Istar, later Anu).38 The epithet always refers to the main manifestation of the individual deity (residing in heaven) by contrast to the diverse local manifestations, which were associated with particular earthly places. It is no accident that the lists of oath-gods in treaties, which were supposed to bind people from different regions, like to name exactly those comprehensive “heavenly



39 On Baaalsamêm see now the comprehensive review of H. Niehr (Baaalsamem. Studien zu Herkunft, Geschichte und Rezeptionsgeschichte eines phönizischen Gottes, OLA 123, Leuven 2003) with a slightly different view of the early history of the god.
16 daniel schwemer
manifestations” at the very beginning of the lists, before the respective local manifestations. In the Hieroglyphic Luwian inscriptions of the first half of the 1st mill. the storm-god Tar¢unza is very often supplied with the epithet “of heaven” (tipasasis Tar¢unzas), without a divine manifestation different from the simple Tar¢unza being meant by it (cf. for example the alternating use of tipasasis Tar¢unzas and simple Tar¢unzas in the inscriptions of Katuwa from Karkamis). Apparently in the Phoenician-speaking area the phrase balsmm “Baaal of Heaven”, which also serves to translate tipasasis Tar¢unzas in the PhoenicianLuwian bilingual of Karatepe, developed into an independent manifestation of the storm-god that occupied a prominent position especially in the Syro-Palestinian religions of the Hellenistic and Roman periods. How far the emancipation of Baaalsamêm into an independent deity is due to Anatolian-Luwian traditions is still unclear. At any rate the assumption of a simple identity of Tar¢unza with the epithet tipasasis on the one hand and the independent Baaalsamêm on the other is problematic, despite the Karatepe bilingual. It seems more plausible to view Luwian tipasasis Tar¢unzas as one of the points of departure for the later independent development of the deity Baaalsamêm within Phoenician religion. The cult of the god is, however, not restricted to Phoenician-speaking territory. The name is adapted in Aramaic as Baaalsamìn as well. Considering the chronological distribution of the attestations for Hadad and Baaalsamìn in the area of Aramaean cultural influence, we get the impression that the name Baaalsamìn takes over from the name Hadad regionally in the course of the Persian period at least on the level of official religion, which is not too surprising in view of the common roots and similar profile of the two gods. In the first half of the 1st mill. there are no attestations for the combination of the two gods; however, the state of the sources is on the whole very fragmentary. The god Baaalsamìn appears to have been unknown in this period beyond those areas of Syria and Upper Mesopotamia immediately juxtaposed to the Phoenician-speaking territory. The Aramaic papyrus pAmherst 63 (about 3rd cent. B.C., Upper Egypt) names in col. xv and xvi Hadad (or Hadda) in synonymous parallelism with Baaalsamìn and thus gives us a secure terminus post quem for the identification of the two gods.39



40 The relevant chapter in Green, Storm-God ( pp. 89-152) relies uncriticallyand apparently without much first-hand knowledge of the sources themselves—on the problematic study of H.J. Deighton (The ‘Weather-God’ in Hittite Anatolia. An Examination of the Archaeological and Textual Sources, BAR International Series 143, Oxford 1982); it is thus largely flawed and outdated; note that important critical reviews of Deighton’s study are missing from the bibliography (V. Haas, OLZ 80 [1985] 461-463, O. Gurney, JRAS 1983/2, 281-282), while G. Beckman, “The Anatolian Myth of Illuyanka”, JANES 14 (1982) 11-25 was used, but the critical remark on p. 23 fn. 80 apparently went unnoticed. The recent overview-works on Hittite religion (esp. V. Haas, Geschichte der hethitischen Religion, HdO I/15, Leiden 1994, M. Popko, Religions of Asia Minor, Warsaw 1995, both missing from Green’s bibliography, and, more recently, M. Hutter, “Aspects of Luwian Religion”, in: The Luwians, ed. H.C. Melchert, HdO 1/68, Leiden—Boston 2003, 211-280, esp. 220-224) do offer important information but naturally are kept general and sometimes their claims are hard for the user to verify.

7. The Anatolian Storm-Gods Taru and Tar¢un(t)
7.1 Names and Strands of Tradition
The world of religious ideas that we encounter in texts of the Hittite period is characterised by multiple layers of tradition, though it is not always possible to isolate the different individual traditions and to create a coherent complete picture of each of the specific strands of tradition in its ‘original’ form. This is particularly true of the relationship between Old Anatolian-Hattic religious traditions and such ideas that already belonged to the speakers of the Anatolian branch of Indo-European prior to their migration into Anatolia. The influence of Hattic traditions on what became Hittite culture is especially marked in the field of religious ideas and not least the world of the gods, so that a separate investigation of the Hattic storm-god on the one hand and the Hittite-Luwian(-Palaic) stormgod on the other would be impossible. There is no adequate comprehensive study of the Anatolian storm-gods, one of the more urgent desiderata of Hittitology. Thus the following observations can only be provisional.40

Herbordt, Die Prinzen- und Beamtensiegel der hethitischen Großreichszeit auf Tonbullen aus dem Ni{antepe-Archiv in Hattusa, Mainz 2005, 295. 43 The interpretation of the writing of the name of a god, iconographically identified as a storm-god, in the Aleppo temple with a mace symbol is still unclear and without parallel. G. Bunnens proposes tentatively that the god in question might be a personified weapon of the storm-god depicted in the fashion of the storm-god (see “The Storm-God in Northern Syria and Southern Anatolia from Hadad of Aleppo to Jupiter Dolichenus”, in: Offizielle Religion, lokale Kulte und individuelle Religiosität, ed. M. Hutter—S. Hutter-Braunsar, AOAT 318, Münster 2004, 63-64). 44 Contra Green, Storm-God, 128, who without any explanation still refers to “Datta” as one of the names of the “Luwian Storm-gods”.

The Hattic storm-god was called Taru; his name is written syllabically and with the usual Sumerograms (dISKUR, d10). It is unclear whether the Hattic name of the god, who is also represented theriomorphically as a bull, is to be connected with the bull-word as attested in Semitic and Indo-European languages.41 The name of the Hittite-Luwian storm-god is attested in various forms, all of which ultimately go back to the Indo-European base *torh2-, which
is continued in Hittite as tar¢- “be powerful”, “overcome”.42 The most important form of the name in Cuneiform Luwian is Tar¢unt(< *tar¢uwant-), a participial form which has a Vedic cognate with the meaning “storming along”. In Hieroglyphic Luwian the nominative form Tar¢unz (Tar¢unt-s) is secondarily thematised in -a, whereby the stem as used in the nominative and accusative are produced (Tar¢unza-). Beside the participial form the shorter form Tar¢u- occurs, which especially in Hittite is then extended to the (secondarily thematised) n-stem Tar¢unn(a)-, though Hittite texts also use frequently the Luwian form Tar¢unta- with a-thematisation. Syllabic writings are extremely rare, and as a rule logograms (with phonetic complements) are used: dISKUR, d10, Hieroglyphic DEUStonitrus (with special logograms for Tessub: DEUSl.318, DEUSfortis).43 The god Tatta is not a storm god, but a mountain-god, and Tatta is not a reading for dISKUR or d10.44 The name of the Palaic stormgod cannot be read for certain. M. Popko proposes Ziparwa, who is prominent in the Palaic pantheon, as the reading of the logographically written dISKUR (resp. d10) in the relevant contexts, but

this remains without certain proof.45 It is conspicuous that the name of the Hittite-Luwian storm-god is an appellative without parallel in the other Indo-European panthea and, at the same time, sounds similar to Hattic Taru. Thus it is conceivable that the name was a new formation under the influence of Hattic Taru.46 Hittite-Luwian Tar¢un(t) would then be nothing more than the Old-AnatolianHattic storm- and bull-god as adapted by the Luwians and Hittites. One of the important gods worshipped in the city of Kanes (Hittite Nesa) during the Old Assyrian period was the god Nipas (Ni-pá-as), a deity so far not attested after the Kültepe II period (neither in Old Assyrian Ib texts nor in Hittite texts). G. Kryszat recently pointed out that while a number of priests of the local Anatolian storm-god (always written dISKUR) are mentioned in documents of the later phase of Old Assyrian trade at Kanes (Ib),47 no certain attestations for the local Anatolian storm-god written dISKUR are known so far from texts of the Kültepe II period. He concludes that the Anatolian storm-god of Kanes was no other than the god Nipas, whose name he tentatively connects with the HittiteLuwian word for “sky, heaven” nepis- resp. tappas- (tipas-). The local storm-god of Kanes-Nesa, one of the most important early Hittite settlements in Anatolia, would have been the deified sky, just as the storm-god is frequently called “storm-god of heaven” from the Old Hittite period onwards. He would have been superseded by Tar¢un(t) after the level II period.48 Though this hypothesis may look attractive at first sight, there are a number of important objections to be raised. First of all, there are attestations for the local storm-god written dISKUR in Kültepe II texts. There can be little doubt that the fragmentary passage TC 3, 191 obv. 11f. is to be restored PN [gudu4] sa dISKUR, and the name of the priest is most likely Anatolian, certainly not Assyrian;49 two more attestations for



can be little doubt that gudu4 (or possibly another priestly title) has to be restored. Kryszat reads the name in question Wa-ar-ga-tí-e[l], and this may be better than the Wa-ar-kà-l[i] (comparable to Hittite warkant- “fat”) proposed in Wettergottgestalten. Nevertheless, the name is certainly not Assyrian, but most likely Anatolian (cf. already E. Laroche, Les noms des Hittites, Études linguistiques 4, Paris 1966, 204). 50 For the attestations see supra, fn. 46. 51 See Wettergottgestalten, 242f., cf. also K.R. Veenhof, “Old Assyrian ißurtum, Akkadian eßèrum and Hittite GIS.›UR”, in: Studio historiae ardens. Studies Ph.H.J. Houwink ten Cate, ed.

Rieken, Untersuchungen zur nominalen Stammbildung des Hethitischen, StBoT 44, Wiesbaden 1999, 187-188. 53 See Klinger, StBoT 37, 145-147.

priests of the storm-god are known from level II texts, but in both cases it seems likely that they were serving at the Adad temple in Assur.50 More importantly, the temple of the storm-god (é dISKUR) is mentioned in VS 26, 146 as the place where the ‘Head of the Storehouses’, an official of the Anatolian palace hierarchy, received a garment; it appears very unlikely that this sanctuary should be sought in Assur or that a—so far otherwise not attested—Assyrian Adad shrine within the kàrum is meant.51 Furthermore, Hittite nepisis a neuter noun; it would be surprising to find a neuter noun without any additional morphemes as name of one of the principal gods of Kanes. If Nipas was a Hittite word and the name of one of the most important Hittite gods at the same time, it would also be unexpected that the name does not survive at all after the Old Assyrian period. Finally, the hypothesis has to assume that in the divine Name Nipas the suffix -os/-es- developed as in Luwian (tappas-), while the root itself preserved initial n- as in Hittite (nepis-).52
7.2 Position in the Pantheon
Through all periods of Hittite history the storm-god, whose main manifestation is also called “storm-god of heaven”, stands at the top of the imperial pantheon as well as numerous local panthea together with the sun-goddess, his wife. The highest divine couple, storm-god (Taru, Tar¢un[t]) and sun-goddess (Estan, Istanu), presumably also embodied the cosmic pair heaven and earth, as the sun-goddess can be called “mother of the earth” (perhaps also “mother earth”).53 Presumably it is only from the Old Hittite period that this is connected with the idea of a night manifestation of the sun-goddess, as opposed to the male sun-god of heaven. The actual consort of the storm-god was particularly considered from the Old



54 For the name of the sun-goddess of Arinna cf. Klinger, StBoT 37, 144, J.D. Hawkins,The Hieroglyphic Inscription of the Sacred Pool Complex at Hattusa (Südburg), StBoT Beiheft 3, Wiesbaden 1995, 32. 55 As attested in the well-known texts KUB 29, 1-3 and IBoT 1, 30 //, see most recently Klinger, StBoT 37, 136f. with further literature. 56 Cf. Schwemer, “Das hethitische Reichspantheon. Überlegungen zu Struktur und Genese”, in: Götterbilder—Gottesbilder—Weltbilder. Polytheismus und Monotheismus in der Welt der Antike. vol.

the storm-gods of the ancient near east 21
Hittite period to be the sun-goddess as worshipped in Arinna (Istanu of Arinna, Arinittiya, Ariniddu),54 who is certainly typologically close to the sun-goddess of the earth in terms of the dichotomy sun-god of heaven—sun-goddess of the earth, without actually being a goddess of the underworld. In contrast to Sàla beside Adad or ›èbat beside Tessub, the consort of the storm-god was not an unimportant deity, whose typical functions were exhausted with that of a consort; rather she was equal in rank to her partner and was the most important goddess of the pantheon with her own circle of deities and court. Storm-god and sun-goddess together hand over the country to the Hittite king to administer; he calls them mother and father within the framework of this concept.55 The Hittite king himself was considered to be sun-god of the country at the same time and wore the garb of the sun-god of heaven, with whom he shared various functions. The sun-god of heaven himself was considered the son of the storm-god (later he received a different filiation due to Hurrian and Babylonian influence), but occupied in particular contexts a similarly high or even higher rank to the storm-god, particularly in lists of oath-gods.56 The cult of the storm-god was wide-spread, some 150 cult places are attested in the written sources. The local manifestations of the storm-god were mostly considered to be sons of the storm-god of heaven; the two most important local manifestations, the storm-god of Nerik and the storm-god of Ziplanda, were identified with each other in the Empire Period. The same embedding in the pantheon as son-gods was also then applied to some of the many aspectually differentiated manifestations of the storm-god; typical examples of such aspectually differentiated manifestations of the storm-god include the storm-god “of thunder”, “of the meadow”, “of the (the king’s) person”, “of the market”, “of the army”, “of the oath” etc.



57 E.g. Pi¢aimmi and Pi¢ammi, see CHD P 253.
22 daniel schwemer
Some of the storm-god’s epithets were established as gods in their own right.57 The best known actual son of the storm-god was Telipinu, who himself had characteristics of a storm-god but was seen as an independent deity and was never written with the logograms for the storm-god (see 9.3). The figure of Telipinu, nevertheless, served presumably as the model for the categorisation of the other stormgods as son-gods. The daughter of the storm-god was considered to be the Hattic goddess Inar, who plays an important role in the Illuyanka myth. The likewise Hattic goddess Zintu¢i was regarded as the grand-daughter of the sun-goddess and the storm-god. The father and grand-father of the storm-god are attested in the myth of the lost storm-god. Within a single context, however, we find no more than three generations at the same time. From the Middle Hittite period Syro-Hurrian influences had increasing influence upon the religion practised by the Hittite royal family. Tar¢un(t) was identified with the Hurrian storm-god and king of the gods, Tessub, Hurrian Tessub myths, particularly the Kumarbi-cycle, were transferred to Tarhun(t) as part of the process of translation into Hittite. Particularly Tessub of ›alab occupied an important position in the cult of ›attusa (see supra, 4.4, 5.4). The divine circle of Tessub with ›azzi and Nanni and Sèri and ›urri was integrated permanently into the Hittite imperial pantheon. The sun-goddess of Arinna was identified with ›èbat, consort of Tessub, in some contexts, though in lists of oath-deities and other texts not belonging to the Hurro-Hittite stratum ›èbat never takes the place of the sun-goddess of Arinna, but is listed separately, often with the other Syro-Hurrian gods of Tessub’s circle or with the storm-god of ›alab.
7.3 Modus Operandi in Mythology and Ritual
The storm-god had power over storms, tempests and rain, as the highest god of the pantheon he was also in a special way lord and protector of the land. He was seen as a god of heaven and was frequently called “storm-god of heaven” from the Old Hittite period on. The god was also often represented theriomorphically as a bull down to the late period, even if an anthropomorphic conception was naturally assumed for religious literature; in anthropomorphic

representation the bull still remained his symbolic animal. Thus, it was presumably not only under the influence of the divine circle of Hurrian Tessub that a pair of bulls pulled the chariot of the storm-god; there was also a competing (Luwian) tradition in which horses pulled the chariot of the storm-god.58 The violence of the thunderstorm meant danger for humans, animals and crops. In particular thunder during a storm was seen as an expression of the god’s wrath (as in Mesopotamia), which could then be appeased in special tempest rituals, including the ritual during which the myth of “The Moon-God that Fell from Heaven” in fear during a thunderstorm was recited.59 Mursili’s ‘aphasia’ was interpreted as a consequence of the fear brought upon Mursili II by the storm-god through thunder, the illness of U¢¢aziti of Arzawa was caused by the sighting of the storm-god’s kalmisana-, his thunderbolt or possibly an even more violent manifestation of the god’s might (a meteor?).60 As god of rain, the storm-god was at the same time responsible for the maintenance and welfare of the country. Thus within the great an.da›.SUM-festival in the spring, a rain-ritual was celebrated for the storm-god in Ankuwa.61 The Anatolian myths of the vanished god type, which were primarily, but not exclusively, connected with Telipinu and storm-gods, describe the consequences of the absence of the angry storm-god as drought, famine and the end of all fertility. The return and appeasement of the vanished god brings back abundance, and the storm-god (or Telipinu) reassumes his function as patron of the king.62

The Illuyanka-myth, which was embedded in the purulli springfestival, interpreted the flourishing of vegetation through the early year’s rainfalls as the liberation of the storm-god from a temporary imprisonment (or physical powerlessness in a second version of the myth): The storm-god is defeated by the snake-dragon Illuyanka in battle and imprisoned (or robbed of his heart and eyes). His daughter, Inar, succeeds in liberating her father, but only with the help of a human, a man called ›upasiya; the liberated storm-god then kills Illuyanka (first version). Also in the second version it is only with the help of humans that the storm-god gets back his heart and eyes. He sires a son with the daughter of a poor man; that son is then married off to a daughter of Illuyanka. Being the son of a poor woman, the son enters the house of his wife and asks for the heart and eyes of his father as a compensation to be given to his father’s house. Thus the storm-god regains his old power and kills Illuyanka with its family including his son. The involvement of humans in both versions of the myth probably refers to the king’s role as the storm-god’s administrator and helper on earth. Unfortunately, the passages of the text referring to the king himself are fragmentary and still not well understood. Anyhow, by performing the ritual associated with the myth the land flourished under the patronage of the storm-god.63
8. The Victory of the Storm-God over the Sea
From a short passage in a letter of the correspondence between Mari and Aleppo from the Old Babylonian period it is apparent that a myth was associated with Haddu of ›alab according to which this god achieved the kingship among the gods by means of a victory over the sea-goddess, Têmtum.64 This myth of divine kingship was obviously an essential element of the Aleppine royal ideology; the weapons of Haddu played an important role in the installation of a new king (cf. supra, 4.3.2, 4.4).



65 See Wettergottgestalten, 229ff., 534-541, esp. 534f., cf. also Green, Storm-God, 178-190. 66 See Wettergottgestalten, 232-234, 451f. with fn. 3736; the storm-god’s victory over the sea is mentioned explicitly in KUB 33, 108 obv. II 17' and KUB 44, 7 obv. I 11'f. // KBo 42, 2 obv. I 15f. (CTH 785), perhaps also in KUB 33, 89+ (cf. now also I. Rutherford, “The Song of the Sea (SA A.AB.BA SÌRR): Thoughts on KUB 45.63”, in: Akten des IV. Internationalen Kongresses für Hethitologie Würzburg, 4.-8.

Tunnanu is one of the sea monsters defeated by Ugaritic Baalu (see Wettergottgestalten, 232 fn. 1605-06 with literature). 68 See Wettergottgestalten, 446-454; for more Egyptian parallels see now Th. Schneider, “Texte über den syrischen Wettergott aus Ägypten”, UF 35 (2003) 605-627.
the storm-gods of the ancient near east 25
The mythologeme of the victory of the king of the gods and storm-god over the sea was then associated with various storm-gods in Syria, Upper Mesopotamia and beyond: Baalu of Ugarit defeats the sea-god and temporary king of the gods, Yammu, in his struggle for the kingship among the gods. In Ugarit, too, the myths about the kingship among the gods had great significance for the royal ideology of the ruling class (cf. supra, 6.2.2).65 Various Hittite mythological and ritual fragments which belong to the Syro-Hurrian strand of tradition (mainly KUB 33, 89+, KUB 33, 108, CTH 785) show that a similar myth was told of Hurrian Tessub, which was then transferred, at least superficially, to Hittite Tar¢un(t).66 The motif of the enmity between the sea and the stormgod was also not alien to the myths of the Kumarbi-cycle. The monster ›edammu lives in the sea,67 and the stone giant Ullikummi stands in the sea too. If KBo 26, 105 actually was the last song of the cycle and can be restored in line with the Seth myth attested in the Egyptian ‘Astarte Papyrus’, the conflict between Kumarbi and the storm-god culminated in a fight between the latter and the sea-god, in which the storm-god finally secured the honour of kingship for himself (cf. supra, 5.4). The Astarte papyrus, as well as certain other relevant texts, shows that the material of the myths was adapted in Egypt, too, and associated with Seth, who stood for the Near Eastern storm-god.68 In the second version of the ancient Anatolian Illuyanka-myth (see 7.3) the battle between the storm-god and the snake-dragon

Illuyanka took place by or in the sea. This may be a case of a motif borrowed from North-Syrian traditions, but this is not necessarily true; one should bear in mind that the sea-god also appears in the myth of ‘Telipinu and the Daughter of the Sea’ as a hostile power to the gods of heaven, and this myth is entirely free of NorthSyrian influences.69 Also the sovereignty of Old Testament Yahwe was associated with a victory over the forces of chaos residing in the sea, and, at the latest, in the stories of the conflict between Zeus and Typhon motifs from the second version of the Anatolian Illuyanka-myth occur together with North-Syrian traditions.70 The mythologeme of the victory of the storm-god over the sea is certainly old; whether it is actually attested in incantations from pre-Sargonic Ebla remains questionable.71 The motif is attested early in connection with different gods of Babylonia. It was already associated with the god Tispak in the Akkad period in the Diyala area and tied there to the chaos-fighting motif of Ninurta-mythology (cf. the later Labbu myth). In the great Ninurta myths, however, the sea does not play a role as the opponent of the gods. But also Ninurta receives epithets that praise him as victor over monsters living in the sea like the kusarikku. For Nergal, who shares characteristics with Ninurta as a war-god, we have a myth about his struggle against a sea-monster from the Neo-Assyrian period.72 The motif of the struggle against the powers of chaos in the mythology of Ninurta then formed an essential part of Marduk theology. While only later attested explicitly, it already was taking shape in the Old Babylonian period as a way of justifying the

A Revision of the Relief Depicting a Battle against Tiamat from the Temple of Bel in Palmyra”, WdO 28 (1997) 96116, Annus, The God Ninurta, 194. 74 For W/Mèr, W/Mèrtum and Iluwèr see Wettergottgestalten, 200-210, 32-33. Note that in Wettergottgestalten, 36 fn. 180 (contra S. Zawadski, Garments of the Gods, OBO 218, Fribourg—Göttingen 2006, 182f.) I did not argue for an original identity between Wèr and Immeriya nor do I think that Immeriya was a goddess identical with Immertu, and nowhere did I argue that there is any relation between Immertu and Adad. I do, however, still think that Immertu is likely to be a goddess because of the formation of the name and Immeriya might be the corresponding masculine form. The character of the god Immeriya is unknown, and before more evidence becomes available one cannot tell how significant the variant

elevation of Marduk, a local god of Babylon, to the king of the gods. In Enùma elis the opponent of Marduk in the battle that guarantees him kingship over the gods is not one of the traditional opponents of Ninurta, but Tiàmat, the primeval ocean. This is obviously the same or a very similar narrative motif as attested for Old Babylonian Haddu of Aleppo in his victory over Têmtum (a variant form of Tiàmat). It is therefore not unlikely that the Aleppine storm-god theology and royal ideology had some influence on the Marduk-theology that had recently been formed in Babylon; close relations between the two royal houses are well attested. The fact that similar motifs had already been associated with other gods in Babylonia should have made the reception easier. The mythologeme of the victory of the new king of the gods over the chaotic sea probably originated in the eastern Mediterranean; but it spread so early that the individual lines of the tradition’s history can no longer be traced. Consequently the concrete myths in which the basic motif occurs offer quite a heterogeneous picture. It should finally be noted that the association of the Tiàmat-myth even in Roman times with Palmyrene Bèl is not due to the survival of old Syrian and Upper Mesopotamian traditions, but is owed to Babylonian influence (Marduk-Bèl theology).73
9. Further Gods with Storm-God Characteristics
9.1 The North-Babylonian and Assyrian Storm-God Wèr
The god Wèr (variant form: Mèr), whose name was mostly written Bèr from the Middle Assyrian period, was a storm-god worshipped primarily in North Babylonia, on the Middle Euphrates and in Assyria.74 The divine name, which is always written syllabically and



dwe-er // dim-me-ri-ia in Surpu II 181 really is (for Surpu II 181 see now R. Borger, “SurpuII, III, IV und VIII in „Partitur“”, in: Wisdom, Gods and Literature. Studies W.G. Lambert, ed. A.R. George—I.L. Finkel, Winona Lake 2000, 34). 75 For Mermer(i) see Wettergottgestalten, 58-59, cf. also 29-30.

never with the Sumerogram dISKUR, can be securely attested from the Akkad period, though references outside personal names are so far only available from the Old Babylonian period onwards. It remains highly questionable whether a theophoric element attested in the Early Dynastic onomasticon as Meru (thus?) represents the later god W/Mèr. Linguistic affiliation and etymology have not yet been estabished with certainty. There is no evidence apart from sound that the name would go back to Akkadian *Wàhiru (thus J.-M. Durand), and one would expect the uncontracted form to be preserved in Babylonia and Assyria if not on the Middle Euphrates. A connection with the place-name Mari (and Akkadian amurru, thus M. Bonechi) can be firmly excluded, and an original identity with the geographical name Uri-Warûm, which appears attractive in view of the important position Wèr held in that area, is not proveable either; the fact that the name of Wèr’s wife was W/Mèrtum (not *Wèrìtum or similar) also militates against this hypothesis. A Sumerian etymology (cf. im-mer “north wind”, mer and me-er-me-er “storm”, Emesal me-er “wind”, thus H. Schlobies and, more recently, A.R.W. Green) appears unlikely with regard to the origins and background of Wèr who is never equated by the Babylonian scholars with deified Mermer(i), an epithet attributed to Iskur-Adad, Ninurta, Mercury and Nabû.75 In the Old Babylonian period sources for the cult of Wèr come primarily from northern Babylonia and the Diyala region, but a few relevant personal names occur also in texts from the Babylonian south. From the Middle Babylonian period we have no further information on Wèr from Babylonia, but his cult thrived in Assyria, and was also known in Syria. Wèr is equated with IskurAdad in the god-lists, and from the Old Babylonian period the connection between Wèr and Adad is well attested outside the god-lists, too. Beside Wèr, the god-lists also equate Iluwèr with Adad, clearly a late extended form of the name meaning “the god Wèr” that follows a well-known pattern of formation for Babylonian divine names. This late form of the name is also attested in Aramaic inscriptions from Syrian Tell Afis. It remains unclear whether the writings dbeer in the Neo-Assyrian period should partly be read ìl-be-er. The god Itùrmèr worshipped at Mari was a dynastic and ancestral god (Itùr



76 Contra Green, Storm-God, 61-63, 87-88, who without any further explanation treats the names Ilumèr and Itùrmèr as simple (i.e. phonetic?) variants. 77 For Mardu-Amurru(m)’s character and his relationship to Adad see Wettergottgestalten, 198-200 with further literature (to which add: W.W. Hallo, “Two Letter-Prayers to Amurru”, in: Boundaries of the Ancient Near Eastern World. Studies C.H. Gordon, ed. M. Lubetski e.a., JSOT Suppl. 273, Sheffield 1998, 397-410); cf. now also P.-A. Beaulieu, “The God Amurru as Emblem of Ethnic and Cultural Identity?”, in: Ethnicity in Ancient Mesopotamia (CRRAI 48), ed. W. van Soldt e.a., PIHANS 102, Leiden 2005, 31-46. 78 For A. 975 obv. 19, quoted in Wettergottgestalten, 198 fn. 1353, see now FM 8, text 38. 79 Cf. Wettergottgestalten, 32f. with fn. 160 on Ilamurrum and the similarly structured divine names Il(u)wèr, Ilmìsaru, Iltammes, Ilte¢er, Ilulàya, Ilaba, Il(u)nergal (?) (cf. also W. Farber, “(W)ardat-lilî(m)”, ZA 79 [1969] 17f. on possible IlumErra). Th. Richter, “Die Lesung des Götternamens AN.AN.MAR.TU”, SCCNH 9 (1998) 135-137 argues that the logogram dDINGIR.MAR.DÚ should be interpreted rather as a genitive compound (“God of Amurru”) than a juxtapposition, because the Hurrian translation of the logogram in the 13th cent. Hurro-Babylonian god-list from Emar apparently interprets the logogram as a genitive construction: de-ni-a-mur-r[i-we] (l. 175 according to Laroche, GLH, 82, who first proposed this restoration and indicates that traces of the r[i are preserved). The directly preceding entry interprets dMAR.DÚ as da-mur-ru-[¢e] (restoration Laroche, followed by Richter), i.e. “Amorite” (Amurr(i)=o=¢¢e). This suggests that the author of the Emar god-list interpreted the Akkadian name of the god Amurru as Amurrû and probably associated it rather with the geographical name Amurru contemporary to him than with Mardu-Amurru as the deified “West(ern People)”. Despite Richter’s remarks on the general reliability of the Hurrian interpretations and translations of the list (p. 137), it seems therefore likely that also the following line 175 offers an anachronistic interpretation of dDINGIR.MAR.DÚ as “god of the land of Amurru”. Note that comparison with CAT 1.125 (Ugaritica 5, 504f. text 2), a Hurrian ritual text in alphabetic script from Ugarit, if relevant at all supports this interpretation. The text has i[n]amrw in obv. 6, which, according to Richter (and following him, P.-A., Beaulieu, CRRAI 48, 31 fn. 4), is to be understood not as “god of (the land) Amurru” (thus Laroche in Ugaritica 5), but as a divine name of its own, namely the same “Ilamurrim” that would be represented by dDINGIR.MAR.DÚ in Old
the storm-gods of the ancient near east 29
Mèr originally being a theophoric personal name “Mèr has turned [to me]”) and has nothing to do with W/Mèr.76
9.2 The Babylonian God of the Western People, Mardu-Amurru
The god Amurru(m), Sumerian Mardu, was a Babylonian god who embodied the Western Lands (Akkadian amurrum “west”) in the pantheon and particularly the nomads of the Western Lands, the Amorites, from a Babylonian perspective (amurrum also used as collective noun for “Western people”, “Amorites”).77 In the Amorite cultural area itself his cult played no major role.78 Amurru, whose name also occurs in the extended form Ilamurrum in the Old Babylonian period,79 had among other features those of a storm-god:



Babylonian sources. But the immediate context in the ritual text militates against this interpretation: i[n]amrw is referred to within the sequence in al≈y© i[n]amrw in ugrtw, and neither a “God of Alasiya” nor a “God of Ugarit” are known from other sources. Clearly, all three genitives have to be interpreted as actual geographical names and in is therefore probably plural (enna): “the gods of the land of Alasiya, the gods of the land of Amurru, the gods of the land of Ugarit” (cf. for this interpretation also M. Dietrich—O. Loretz, “Ein hurritisches Totenritual für aAmmistamru III. (KTU 1.125)”, in: Ana sadî Labnàni lù allik. Fs. W. Röllig, ed. B. Pongratz-Leisten e.a., AOAT 247, Münster 1997, 79-89). It goes without saying that the Amurru referred to here has nothing to do with the Amorites or the god Amurrum of the Old Babylonian period, but refers to the land of Amurru to the south of Ugarit. 80 For Rammànu see the references JANER 7/2, 160 fn. 113.
30 daniel schwemer
He bore the epithet Rammànu(m) “Thunderer”, which then became a god’s name in its own right, without actually being separated from Amurru. In literary texts, Mardu-Amurru is described as a lightning-flashing, warlike tempest-god; in the Middle Assyrian godlist KAV 64 the lightning-god Nimgir is ascribed to his divine circle. In depictions on seals from the Old Babylonian period he is often found together with Adad. The lightning symbol stands for him as well as Adad, but Amurru’s special symbol is the nomad’s crook, which is never associated with Adad. Amurru is never written with the logogram diSKUR and also never equated with IskurAdad in the god-lists known so far. At least Hadad of Damascus in the 1st mill. had the same epithet Rammàn(u), and this might have been the case for other Hadad-manifestations, as Rammàn is fairly widespread in the Aramaic onomasticon; particularly in Babylonia the god Amurru was probably understood by it, however, also during the 1st mill. Anyhow, a direct connection between Rammànu as an epithet of Amurru and as an epithet of Aramaean Hadad cannot be established on the basis of the current state of the sources: the god Rammànu (logographically dkur, which is perhaps also used for Amurru himself) is never written with the logogram diSKUR or associated with Adad in the Assyro-Babylonian god-lists.80 One can only speculate on the question of whether the circumstance that Mardu-Amurru had the characteristics of a stormgod was originally connected with the fact that the storm-god Haddu was the most prominent god of the Amorite cultural area beside the moon-god. But it cannot be ruled out that the most important Amorite god served in some respect as model for the conceptualisation of a god embodying the Amorites in the Babylonian pantheon. But



the storm-gods of the ancient near east 31
Mardu-Amurru’s profile comprises many other features which are alien to the storm-god Haddu or Adad, in particular that of the non-urban nomad.
9.3 The Anatolian Vegetation- and Storm-God Telipinu
The Hattic-Hittite god Telipinu was the son of the storm-god TaruTar¢un(t) (see 7.2, 7.3 with further references). His name is never written with the logograms for the storm-god, nor is he ever identified with any of the numerous manifestations of the storm-god considered to be sons of the storm-god (of heaven). He only occupied a secondary position in the Hittite imperial pantheon, as opposed to the storm-god and didn’t play any particular role in the Hittite royal ideology according to the Annals and those texts which are particularly concerned with the relationship of the Hittite king to the storm-god and the sun-goddess. But it is especially with Telipinu, too, that the myth-type of the vanished god was associated. In these myths Telipinu has the typical characteristics of a storm-god: his disappearance brings drought and suffocates all life; he flashes with lightning and thunders in his anger; his appeasement and return brings the land of ›atti back into a state of order, balance and abundance. Within the myth it is Telipinu who appears as the special protector of the king. The purulli-festival in the spring was also celebrated locally for Telipinu, and the Telipinu myth may have served as the festival’s myth in these places. In the myth of “Telipinu and the Daughter of the Sea”, Telipinu appears as the son of the storm-god who marries the daughter of the sea-god to thereby release the sun-god from the power of the sea-god. Telipinu’s original connection to the family of the storm-god as an independent deity with the characteristics of a storm-god in the wake of his father, but primarily representing a son-deity, prevented the identification of Telipinu himself with other manifestations of the storm-god. Nevertheless, the systematisation of local manifestations of the storm-god as sons of the storm-god of heaven will certainly have followed the pattern set by the figure of Telipinu.
10. A Few Remarks on Iconography
There is no comprehensive study of the iconography of the various storm-gods with reliable illustrations and up-to-date information; the following remarks can therefore only have a provisional



81 For various remarks on the storm-god’s iconography which cover most of the following comments see Wettergottgestalten, 124ff., 174 with fn. 1231, 196, 199, 227, 228f., 425 with fn. 3521, 480f. with fn. 3923, 484 with fn. 3960, 615 as well as fn. 3035, 3418, 4097, 5011, 5081 with further references. Green, Storm-God, 13-34, 103-127, 154-165 tries to give a more systematic summary without taking into account, however, more recent studies on the subject; the figures in the book often do not meet the standards of the field, and, as with the texts, reading and interpretation of the evidence heavily relies on secondary literature. Important contributions to the iconography of the storm-gods include: A. Vanel, L’iconographie du dieu de l’orage dans le Proche-Orient ancien jusqu’au VIIe siècle avant J.-C., Cahiers de la Revue Biblique 3, Paris 1964; A. Abou-Assaf, “Die Ikonographie des altbabylonischen Wettergottes”, BaM 14 (1983) 43-66; Natural Phenomena. Their Meaning, Depiction and Description in the Ancient Near East, ed. D.J.W. Meijer, Amsterdam e.a. 1992 (various articles); E.A. Braun-Holzinger, “Altbabylonische Götter und ihre Symbole. Benennung mit Hilfe der Siegellegenden”, BaM 27 (1996) 235-359; E. Klengel-Brandt, “Eine ungewöhnliche Wettergottdarstellung”, AoF 29 (2002) 288295; D. Beyer, Emar IV: Les sceaux, OBO SA 20, Fribourg—Göttingen 2001, 299306; K. Jakubiak, “New Aspects of God Teisheba’s Iconography, AoF 31 (2004) 87-100; G. Bunnens in: G. Bunnens—J. D. Hawkins—I. Leirens, Tell Ahmar II. A New Luwian Stele and the Cult of the Storm-God at Til Barsib-Masuwari, Leuven 2006, 33135; idem, “The Storm-God in Northern Syria and Southern Anatolia from Hadad of Aleppo to Jupiter Dolichenus”, in: Offizielle Religion, lokale Kulte und individuelle Religiosität, ed. M. Hutter—S. Hutter-Braunsar, AOAT 318, Münster 2004, 57-81. 82 Unlike in later periods the representations of gods on Akkadian seals are not identified by name in accompanying seal inscriptions. Following H. Frankfort, R.M. Boehmer identified a number of iconographical types on Akkadian seals as storm-gods (“Wettergottheiten”, “Donnergott”, see Die Entwicklung der Glyptik während der Akkad-Zeit, UAVA 4, Berlin 1965, 62ff.) without committing himself to a specific name. Taking into account the evidence from the texts and the later development of the iconographical motifs associated with Iskur-Adad it appears most likely that the storm-god on the Akkadian seals is no other than Iskur-Adad. It is true that a specific type of lion-dragon is associated with Ninurta too, and that Ninurta exhibits traits of a storm-god within the context of his role as warlike victor over the powers of chaos. In the Neo-Assyrian period Ninurta can be depicted chasing the Anzû-bird with lightning (‘thunderbolts’), and these scenes are sometimes misinterpreted as representations of Adad (cf. Wettergottgestalten, 174 fn. 1231 with references, cf. now also, especially for the attestations of the motif on seals D. Collon, “The Iconography of Ninurta”, in: The Iconography of Cylinder Seals, ed. P. Taylor, Warburg Institute Colloquia 9, London—Turin 2006, 101, 105f.). Nevertheless, it appears unlikely that the storm-god depicted on Akkadian (or later on Mittani-period) cylinder seals is meant to represent Ningirsu-Ninurta (differently D. Collon, art. cit., 101f., 107f.).

character.81 The earliest pictorial representations of the Babylonian storm-god, in all likelyhood Iskur-Adad,82 are to be found in the glyptics of the Old Akkadian period. As a rule the god stands on a chariot with two axles that is pulled by a water(?)-spitting liondragon. He also swings the whip symbolising both thunder and lightning, the flick and crack of the whip. The winged lion-dragon is to be identified with the storm-monsters who, according to the

Matthiae e.a., Leiden 1990, 363-378, and “The Rainbow in Ancient West Asian Iconography”, in: Natural Phenomena. Their Meaning, Depiction and Description in the Ancient Near East, ed. D.J.W. Meijer, Amsterdam e.a. 1992, 149-168.

texts, pull the chariot of Iskur-Adad, when the god storms and rumbles over the sky. The storm-god can be accompanied by a sometimes naked, sometimes clothed goddess who is surrounded by rain or holding rain-water (sometimes also lightning?) in her hands; both the storm-god and the goddess are also shown standing on liondragons. The naked rain-goddess, who also appears in the glyptic of the 2nd mill., should probably be identified with Medimsa-Sàla. The same iconographic motif is also attested in the Syrian and Upper Mesopotamian area, but here the female escort of the stormgod cannot be simply identified with Sàla. One should always bear in mind that iconographic motifs can be borrowed and reinterpreted without necessarily adopting the concept that was associated with them originally. The goddess sometimes stands in a (winged) ‘door’-arch, which perhaps represents the same motif as the ‘winged temple on a bull’ in Old Akkadian glyptic and presumably symbolises the rainbow, which as so many phenomena and creatures of the sky is depicted in Mesopotamian art as winged.83 Seals of the Akkad-period showing the storm-god, or a god associated with him, as a bull-killer attest to the existence of a myth unknown from the texts. Otherwise in Babylonia the bull does not appear as an animal accompanying the storm-god before the Ur III period (but cf. the following paragraph for a rare exception). From the second half of the Ur III-period it can be observed that the bull supersedes the previously pre-dominant lion-dragon in the figurative inventory of glyptic art as the symbolic creature of the storm-god, admittedly without replacing him completely; until the late period representations with bull and lion-dragon at the same time are to be found. Usually the god stands on the bull, or is about to mount it, holding the lightning symbol and often the bull’s reins as well. A frequent variant shows the god beside the bull, which carries the lightning symbol on its back. The motif of the storm-god riding on a chariot drawn by a mythic animal symbolising (aspects of) the storm is not attested anymore in the Ur III and Old Babylonian periods. However, even in depictions of the Old Akkadian period, the chariot of the storm-god is not exclusively pulled



84 See Wettergottgestalten, 124-127. The statement that the figurine of a bullriding man from 6th mill. Çatal Hüyük may be the earliest anthropomorphous representation of the storm-god does not become any more meaningful by its regular repetition (cf. most recently M. Herles, Götterdarstellungen Mesopotamiens in der 2. Hälfte des 2. Jahrtausends v. Chr., AOAT 329, Münster 2006, 263). In a number of

by the lion-dragon, but in at least one case also by a bull, so that one can assume that the bull (or bulls) took over also this role in 2nd mill. Mesopotamian art; the motif is of course well-attested for 2nd and 1st mill. Syria and Anatolia both textually and iconographically. Likewise, in the first half of the 2nd mill., the motif of the storm-god leading a bull or a yoke of bulls by a bridle became established in Old Syrian glyptical art. Finally the Kültepeseals also show two types of storm-gods with reins, who, however, stand on the bull or are mounting it. At the same time this group of seals exhibits representations of the storm-god standing on the lion-dragon in traditional Babylonian fashion and of a completely theriomorphically depicted bull-god. The latter occurs nowhere else, is of Anatolian origin and must be identified with TaruTar¢un(t), who could still be represented in bull form in the Hittite period. The use of the wild bull as symbolic animal of the god of storm and tempest thus does not originate in the Sumerian tradition, and while it appears now and then in the Sargonic period in Babylonia, it becomes predominant only in the era of the Amorite dynasties of the Old Babylonian period. The fact that we know of no older instances of this motif from North Syria and Upper Mesopotamia too is probably due to two factors: on the one hand the thematic inventory of older Syrian glyptic art, from which depictions of gods, as known from the seals of the Old Akkadian period, are completely absent; on the other hand our still very incomplete knowledge of the iconography of 3rd mill. Syrian art on the whole. The central Anatolian bull- and storm-god should be kept separate, at least in the historical periods, from this North-Syrian bull symbolism, which was probably associated with Hadda. A combination of these two concepts can only be observed in the pictorial programme of the Kültepe-seals. Prehistoric depictions and figurines of bulls, of anthropomorphic figures on bulls, bucrania and bull-horn installations from the Anatolian, Syrian and Mesopotamian area should not be associated too quickly with the storm-god iconography of the historical periods.84 They



contributions J. Cauvin has drawn attention to the fact that from the 8th mill., and especially with the beginning of rainfall agriculture in Syria and Anatolia, bull and woman (usually in form of figurines) emerge as prominent religious symbols (see e.g. The Birth of the Gods and the Origins of Agriculture, Cambridge 2000, 123-125). While the wild bull may have been associated—among other things—with rain and thunderstorm already in the Neolithic period and the fact that storm-gods in Anatolia, Syria and Upper Mesopotamia during the historical periods are associated primarily with the bull may stand in some sort of continuity to the prehistoric religious symbols, the overall assemblage of religious symbols from the Neolithic periods is so different from the iconographic conventions of the later ancient Near Eastern cultures that an isolated identification of a specific (type of) god with an iconographic motif attested at least two millennia earlier contributes little to a better understanding of both phenomena. 85 On the latter point see Ch. Watanabe, Animal Symbolism in Mesopotamia. A Contextual Approach, WOO 1, Wien 2002. 86 See U. Calmeyer-Seidl, “W”, in: Studien zur Altertumskunde Kleinasiens. Fs. K. Bittel, ed. R.M. Boehmer—H.

need interpretation firstly within their own iconographic context. Also one should bear in mind that the wild bull is not exclusively the symbol of the storm-god in the historical periods, either: all deities are characterised by bull-horns in ancient Near Eastern iconography; additionally, the wild bull is, like the lion, a symbolic animal of kingship and associated with different deities within this context.85 Bull and various lightning symbols remain through all historical periods the characteristic attributes of the storm-god. It is not certain that the bucranion is a symbol of the storm-god, the tonitrus sign of the Hieroglyphic Luwian script could, however, represent a stylised pair of bull-horns.86 The anthropomorphic depictions of the storm-god vary considerably from region to region and from period to period, and would need individual presentation far beyond the scope of the present summary. Different manners of depiction can be be ascribed to particular storm-gods, as long as the iconographic conventions follow the same linguistic-cultural borders as the texts. As G. Bunnens has shown for the representations of the storm-god of Aleppo in late 2nd and early 1st mill. art, certain iconographic conventions can be specific for local manifestations of the god, in the case of the storm-god of Aleppo even across linguistic borders.87 A general rule of thumb could be that in those



regions and periods in which the concrete reading of the logogram for the storm-god in the texts is difficult, the specific naming of pictorial representations of the god is problematic too, even if, as in the glyptic of the Old Assyrian period or of Late Bronze Age Emar, the various iconographic traditions can be clearly differentiated.88 One of the typical manners of depicting the storm-god shows him with a weapon (or the lightning symbol) raised to strike, a gesture which is attested with other warlike gods as well. In 2nd mill. Syria, Anatolia and Upper Mesopotamia the storm-god often stands on mountains (gods) or, especially in the 1st mill., on a bull. A few Old Syrian seals show the storm-god as killer of a snake. These depictions certainly refer to the motif of the storm-god as victor over monsters living in the sea, which is attested within the framework of the myths about the storm-god defeating the sea.89 The Syrian storm-god is depicted on seals—but particularly prominently on the famous Baalu-stele from Ugarit—with a downward-pointing lance, the upper shaft of which ends in plant-like lines. This vegetal shaft-end has been interpreted as a symbol for the vegetationfurthering effect of the storm-god, as a ‘tree-of-life’, as ‘tree-weapon’90 or as stylised lightning symbol (‘lightning-tree’ with reference to aß brq in CAT 1.101 obv. 4). In my view the plant-like shaft-end may rather be a pictorial representation of the rolling thunder, as it is frequently attested in Syrian glyptic art before the mouth of the storm-god, albeit in horizontal orientation.91

88 Cf. E.A. Braun-Holzinger, WdO 33 (2003) 265f. with respect to the stormgod iconography of the Emar seals: “Ob die Siegelbesitzer wirklich diese drei Bildtypen unterschiedlich benannten, ist fraglich; so wie der meist dISKUR geschriebene Namen des Wettergottes unterschiedlich gelesen wurde, konnte auch der Bildtyp des waffenschwingenden Gottes mit Blitz sicher unterschiedlich ‘gelesen’ werden”. 89 See the references given in Wettergottgestalten, 227f. with fn. 1575, and cf. now also W.G.

But especially in view of CAT 1.101 obv. 4 where within a description of Baalu the image of the god’s lightning in the sky is likened to a tree bearing multiple branches (aß brq “tree of lightning”) an interpretation as stylised lightning cannot be ruled out either.

Dietrich, AOAT 281, Münster 2002, 647-684, esp. 676 (interpretation of An—Anum I 326 misleading, however). p. 39 with fn. 204 and passim: Following M. Streck (AOAT 271/1, 240ff., 187ff.) spellings like zi-im-ri-e-id-da are interpreted as Zimriyidda (zi-im-ri-jì-id-da) in Wettergottgestalten. It should be noted, however, that names like ia-aq-qú-ub-e-da and ia-ab-lu-u†-e-da (see Wettergottgestalten, 44) suggest that a variant Edda (or Ya/idda?) developed also outside the phonetic context i(h)a resp. iya (> iyi > e/i). The usage of the sign e needs further study. D. Charpin (and others) still prefer to assume a contraction i+a > ê (Zimrêddu etc.), see most recently RA 98 (2004) 156 ad x 9. p. 44: Add possibly the PN Bu-ul-li-†á-di (Labarna letter rev. 25, see M. Salvini, The ›abiru Prism of King Tunip-tessup of Tikunani, DA 3, Roma 1996, pp. 107ff.). p. 56 fn. 299: J.

In Parmenidem VII p. 58.30-60.9: “the demiurgic intellect of the world, which they call ‘Adad, worthy of all praise’” (see Proclus’ Commentary on Plato’s Parmenides, ed. G.R. Morrow—J.M. Dillon, Princeton 1987, 594, cf. also H.D. Saffrey, Recherches sur le néoplatonisme après Plotin, Paris 1990, 77f.).
p. 57: Add the following syllabic spelling of Adad (Addu) in Assyrian SB manuscripts: dad-di (unpubl. 81-2-4, 311 l. col. 9'), dad-du (S.M. Maul, MDOG 133 [2001] 19: VAT 10916 obv. 14', now also in: A.R. George, The Babylonian Gilgamesh Epic, Oxford 2003, vol. 2, pl. 31), da-da-a (KAR 237 obv. 20), dad-de-e-a ka-ßir erpèti(dungu.mes) (Ass. Ph. 4198d = Ass. 13956fs = A 2731 obv.? 1, excavation and Istanbul museum number courtesy S.M. Maul). p. 84: dad-gi is attested as (corrupt?) variant of dad-gi4-gi4 in CT 24, 32: 97b (An—Anum III 167). The latter is usually understood as divine counselor and dad-gi4-ma¢ would then be the supreme counsellor (see B. Alster, “Incantation to Utu”, ASJ 13 [1991] 52: 95 and the pertinent note ibid., 84, cf. also PSD A III 18-19). Whether the god Adgi qualified as min (= diSKUR) su-u¢ki is the same Adgi remains questionable. Note that Sum. ad-gi4-gi4 is also translated as rigma apàlu “to resonate” (see OBGT XVII 7, see MSL 4, 127) which might provide a more fitting etymology for a stormgod called Adgi. p. 86: The spelling dba-hu-ú-lu for expected *ba-ah-lu (Baalu) was explained as a ‘phonetic’ rendering of West-Semitic a. W.R. Mayer suggests that the form could be explained as a qattùl-form which is used for affectionate names in Aramaic, Hebrew and Arabic (see F. Praetorius, “Über einige Arten hebräischer Eigennamen”, ZDMG 57 [1903] 773-776 [with further literature], M. Noth, Die israelitischen Personennamen, Stuttgart 1928, 38): “Entsprechend könnte man vorschlagen, baaaùl (ba-hu-ú-lu) für so einen Kosenamen des Gottes Baal zu halten” (letter, 8th May 2007). While this interpretation provides an elegant explanation of the aberrant spelling, it seems unlikely that a list like K 2100 would include a rare by-form of the god’s name rather than its normal form. p. 103: On pa4-sis see now Th. Krispijn, “pa4-ses ‘Ältester’ ”, in: Von Sumer nach Ebla und zurück. Fs. G. Pettinato, ed. H. Waetzoldt, Heidelberg 2004, 105-112. p. 107: On ki:lamx see now also M.G.

p. 426 fn. 3528: sá é-sag-gíl may well be part of the original inscription; the seal then would have belonged to the Adad worshipped in Babylon’s main sanctuary (cf. p. 638f.). p. 446 fn. 3709: For Ea-sarru cf. also H.D.

Maul, “Neue Textvertreter der elften Tafel des Gilgamesch-Epos”, MDOG 133 (2001) 46f. p. 447, 1.22: Despite the copy the traditional reading na-as (not MUSEN-as ) is probably preferable. p. 448, 1.31: For this line see now H.A. Hoffner, Die Sprache 43 (2002-3) 80, 84f. p. 457 fn. 3774: KUB 36, 7a + 17, 7+ (instead of “KUB XXXVI 7a+ || VII 7+). p. 458 fn. 3779: In light of the cult inventory KUB 38, 12, I would still argue that the cities of Kumme (Kummiya) and Kumma (in the region of ›urma?) should be kept separate. It must be admitted, however, that the sequence of deities in KUB 45, 77: 10' = ChS 1/9, 104 (storm-god of Kumma, sun-goddess of Arinna, ›èbat) suggests that Kumma is also used as a by-form of Kumme (Kummiya). Otherwise the evidence is inconclusive: The storm-god of Kumma is named beside the storm-god of ›alab in the oracle-text IBoT 1, 33 (obv. 42) and might be mentioned in IBoT 2, 70 rev. 1', a fragmentary list of storm-gods, before the storm-god of ›alab and the storm-god of invocation (¢alziyawas ), who belongs to the circle of the Aleppine storm-god. The storm-god of Kumma figures prominently in KUB 3, 87, an Akkadian fragment that appears to be part of a letter, probably sent by an important prince or official in the region of Mittani, maybe in Alze, to Suppiluliuma. The text deals with oracle messages of the storm-gods of Iptalaim (sic?) and Kumma within the context of Suppiluliuma’s Syrian campaign. The text mentions Antaratli, who is well known from the historical introduction of the Sattiwaza-treaty. This suggests that the letter was written sometime shortly before, during or after Suppiluliuma’s one-year campaign, when Suppiluliuma installed Antaratli as king of Alze. The message of the storm-god of Kumma reminds one of the oracles of the stormgod of ›alab quoted in the famous letters of Zimrì-Lìm’s Aleppocorrespondence. I offer a tentative transliteration and translation of the fragment (cf. also A. Hagenbuchner, Die Korrespondenz der Hethiter, THeth 16, Heidelberg 1989, II 459f. text 349; for a photograph see S. Kosak, Konkordanz der hethitischen Keilschrifttafeln, Online-Datenbank, Version 1.1: http://www.hethport.uni-wuerzburg.de/hetkonk/):

Kumma?) too [sent] a messe[nger] to me.

[Your enemies] I [made bow down] at your feet. [Your . . .] I am!” And the storm-god of Kumm[a . . .
Unfortunately the fragmentary text contains no information on the location of Kumma. The storm-god of Iptalaim is unknown otherwise; the mere fact that the storm-god of Kumma is referred as the god who gave Suppiluliuma his weapons can hardly prove that it is the famous Tessub of Kumme whose oracle is consulted. If the author of our letter was in the region of Alze at the time and if Kumma is to be sought not too far from ›urma, it could well be the storm-god of South-Anatolian Kumma who is referred to here, not his famous counterpart residing far away on the Eastern ›abur. p. 479: For KUB 7, 60 // see now G.
