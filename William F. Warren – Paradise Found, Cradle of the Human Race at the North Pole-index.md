PREFACE.
THIS book is not the work of a dreamer. Neither
has it proceeded from a love of learned paradox.
Nor yet is it a cunningly devised fable aimed at
particular tendencies in current science, philosophy,
or religion. It is a thoroughly serious and sincere
attempt to present what is to the author s mind
the true and final solution of one of the greatest
and most fascinating of all problems connected
with the history of mankind.
That this true solution has not been furnished
before is not strange. The suggestion that primi tive Eden was at the Arctic Pole seems at first
sight the most incredible of all wild and willful
paradoxes. And it is only within the lifetime of
our own generation that the progress of geological discovery has relieved the hypothesis of fatal ante
cedent improbability. Moreover, when one consid ers the enormous variety and breadth of the fields
from which its evidences of truth must be derived ; when one remembers how recent are those com
parative sciences on whose results the argument
must chiefly depend ; when one observes that many
of the most striking of our alleged proofs, both in



Viii PREFACE.
the physical and in the anthropological domain, are precisely the latest of the conclusions of these
most modern of all sciences, it is easy to see that
a generation ago the demonstration here attempted could not have been given. Even five years ago
some of the most interesting and cogent of our
arguments would as yet have been lacking. The interest which has so long invested our
problem, and which has prompted so many at
tempts to solve it, was never greater than to-day. The lapse of centuries has rendered many another
question antiquated, but not this. On the con trary, the more the modern world has advanced in
new knowledge, the more exigent has grown the necessity of finding a valid solution. Men are feel
ing as never before that until the starting-point of
human history can be determined, the historian,
the archaeologist, and the paleontological anthro
pologist are all working in the dark. It is seen
that without this desideratum the ethnologist, the
philologist, the mythographer, the theologian, the sociologist can none of them construct anything
not liable to profound modification, if not to utter
overthrow, the moment any new light shall be
thrown upon the mother-region and the prehistoric movements of the human race. Every anthropolog
ical science, therefore, and every science related to
anthropology, seems at the present moment to be
standing in a state of dubitant expectancy, will
ing to work a little tentatively, but conscious of



PREFACE. ix
its destitution of the needful primal datum, and
conscious of its consequent lack of a valid struc
tural law.
To the believer in Revelation, or even in the
most ancient and venerable Ethnic Traditions, the
volume here presented will be found to possess un
common interest. For many years the public mind
has been schooled in a narrow naturalism, which
has in its world-view as little room for the ex
traordinary as it has for the supernatural. Decade
after decade the representatives of this teaching have been measuring the natural phenomena of
every age and of every place by the petty measur
ing rod of their own local and temporary experience.
So long and so successfully have they dogmatized on the constancy of Nature s laws and the uniform
ity of Nature s forces that of late it has required
no small degree of courage to enable an intelligent man to stand up in the face of his generation and
avow his personal faith in the early existence of
men of gigantic stature and of almost millenarian
longevity. Especially have clergymen and Chris tian teachers and writers upon Biblical history
been embarrassed by the popular incredulity on
these subjects, and not infrequently by a conscious ness that this incredulity was in some measure
shared by themselves. To all such, and indeed
to all the broader minded among the naturalists
themselves, a new philosophy of primeval history
a philosophy which for all the alleged extraordinary



X PREFACE.
effects provides the adequate extraordinary causes cannot fail to prove most welcome.
The execution of the plan of the book is by no
means all that the author could desire. To the
elaboration of so vast an argument, the materials
for which must be gleaned from every possible field
of knowledge, the broadest and profoundest scholar
might well devote the undistracted labor of a life
time. To the writer, loaded with the cares of a
laborious executive office, there were lacking both
the leisure and the equipment otherwise attainable
for so high a task. The best he could do was to
turn one or two summer vacations into work-time
and give the result to the world. Of the correct
ness of his position he has no doubt, and of the
preparedness of the scientific world to accept it he
is also confident.
To the foregoing remarks it may be proper to add
that apart from its immediate purpose the book has
interest, and, it is hoped, value as a contribution to
the infant science of Comparative Mythology. By
the application of the author s &quot; True Key to An
cient Cosmology and Mythical Geography,&quot; it has
been possible to adjust and interpret a great va
riety of ancient cosmological and geographical no tions never before understood by modern scholars.
For example, the origin and significance of the Chinvat Bridge are here for the first time explained.
The indication of the polocentric character com
mon to the mythical systems of sacred geography



PREFACE. XI
among all ancient peoples will probably be new to
every reader. The new light thrown upon such
questions as those relating to the direction of the
Sacred Quarter, the location of the Abode of the
Dead, the character and position of the Cosmical
Tree, the course of the backward-flowing Oceanriver, the correlation of the &quot; Navels &quot; of Earth and
Heaven, not to enumerate other points, can
hardly fail to attract the lively attention of all stu
dents and teachers of ancient mythology and myth
ical geography. To teachers of Homer the fresh contributions to
ward a right understanding of Homeric cosmology are sure to prove of value. And if, in the end, trie
work may only lead to a systematic and intelligent
teaching of the long neglected, but most important
science of ancient cosmology and mythical geog raphy in all reputable universities and classical
schools, it will surely not have been written in vain.
That the author has escaped all errors and over
sights while ranging through so numerous and such
diverse fields of investigation, many of which are
but just opened to the pioneering specialist, is too much to expect. He only asks that any such blem
ishes which a more competent scholarship may de
tect, or which the progress of new learning may
yet bring to light, may not be allowed to prejudice the force of true arguments, but may be pointed out
in the spirit of a candid and helpful criticism.
In conclusion, the author respectfully commits



Xii PREFACE.
his work to all truth-seeking spirits, not less to
the patient investigators of nature than to the stu
dents of history, of literature, and of religion. Par
ticularly would he commend it to all those yearning
and waiting Konigssohnen whose experience has been described by Hans Andersen in the words,
&quot; Es war einmal ein Konigssohn ; Niemand hatte so
viele und schb ne Bucher wie er ; Alles, was in dieser
Welt geschehen, konnte er darin lesen, und die Ab
bildungen in prachtigen Kupferstichen erblicken. Von jedem Volke und jedem Lande konnte er Auskunft erhalten ; aber wo der Garten des Para
dieses zu finden sei, davon stand kein Wort darin ;
und der, gerade der war es, an dem er am meisten

1 The same, being interpreted, read as follows :
&quot; Once upon a
time there was a king s son ; nobody had so many and such beau tiful books as he. In these all that had ever happened in the world
he could read and see depicted in splendid engravings. Of every people and of every land could he get information, but as to where the Garden of Eden was, not a word was to be found therein ;
and this, just this it was, on which he meditated most of all.&quot;

You shall understand that no mortal may approach to that Paradise ; for by land
no man may go, for wild beasts that are in the deserts, and for the high mountains
and great huge rocks that no man may pass by for the dark places that are there ;
and by the rivers may no man go, for the water runs so roughly and so sharply, be cause it comes down so outrageously from the high places above, that it runs in so great waves that no ship may row or sail against it ; and the water roars so, and makes so huge a noise, and so great a tempest, that no man may hear another in the ehip though he. cried with all the might he could. Many great lords have assayed with great will many times to pass by those rivers towards Paradise, with full great companies ; but they might not speed in their voyage ; and many died for weariness of rowing against the strong waves ; and many of them became blind, and many deaf, from the noise of the water ; and some perished and were lost in the waves ; so that no mortal man may approach to that place without the special grace of God. SIR JOHN DE MAUNDEVILLB.

ONE of the most interesting and pathetic pas sages to be found in all literature is that in which Christopher Columbus announces to his royal pa trons his supposed discovery of the ascent to the gate of the long-lost Garden of Eden. With what emotions must his heart have thrilled as, steering
up this ascent, he felt his &quot; ships smoothly rising toward the sky,&quot; the weather becoming &quot;milder&quot; as
he rose ! To be so near the Paradise of God s own planting, to be the first discoverer of the way in which the believing world could at length, after so
many ages, once more approach its sacred precincts even if forbidden to enter, what an exquisite ex
perience it must have been to the lonely spirit of
that great explorer !
It is his third voyage. He is in the Gulf of Paria to the north or north-west of the mouth of the Ori noco. In his loyal epistle to Ferdinand and Isabella thus he writes :
The Holy Scriptures record that our Lord made the earthly Paradise and planted in it the tree of life ; and thence springs a fountain from which the four princi pal rivers of the world take their source ; namely, the

Ganges in India, the Tigris and Euphrates, and the Nile. I do not find, nor ever have found, any account by the
Romans or Greeks which fixes in a positive manner the site of the terrestrial Paradise, neither have I seen it given in any mappe-monde, laid down from authentic sources. Some placed it in Ethiopia at the sources of the Nile, but
others, traversing all these countries, found neither the temperature nor the altitude of the sun correspond with their ideas respecting it ; nor did it appear that the over whelming waters of the deluge had been there. Some
pagans pretended to adduce arguments to establish that it was in the Fortunate Islands, now called the Canaries. St. Isidore, Bede, and Strabo l and the Master of scho lastic history, 2 with St. Ambrose and Scotus, and all the
learned theologians agree that the earthly Paradise is in the East. I have already described my ideas concerning this hemisphere and its form,8 and I have no doubt that if I could pass below the equinoctial line after reaching the highest point of which I have spoken, I should find a much milder temperature and a variation in the stars and in the water : not that I suppose that elevated point to be navigable, nor even that there is water there ; indeed, I believe it is impossible to ascend thither, because I am
convinced that it is the spot of the earthly Paradise, whither no one can go but by God s permission ; but this
land which your Highnesses have now sent me to explore is very extensive, and I think there are many other countries in the south, of which the world has never had
any knowledge. I do not suppose that the earthly Paradise is in the
form of a rugged mountain, as the descriptions of it have made it appear, but that it is on the summit of the spot

RESULTS OF EXPLORERS. 5
which I have described as being in the form of the stalk [or stem end] of a pear ; the approach to it from a dis
tance must be by a constant and gradual ascent ; but I
believe that, as I have already said, no one could ever reach the top; I think also that the water I have de
scribed may proceed from it, though it be far off, and that
stopping at the place I have just left, it forms this lake. There are great indications of this being the terres
trial Paradise, for its situation coincides with the opinions
of the holy and wise theologians whom I have mentioned ; and, moreover, the other evidences agree with the sup position, for I have never either read or heard of fresh
water coming in so large a quantity, in close conjunction with the water of the sea ; the idea is also corroborated by the blandness of the temperature; and if the water of which I speak does not proceed from the earthly Paradise, it seems to be a still greater wonder, for I do not believe that there is any river in the world so large
and deep.
When I left the Dragon s Mouth, which is the north ernmost of the two straits which I have described, and which I so named on the day of our lady of August, 1 I found that the sea ran so strongly to the westward that between the hour of mass,2 when I weighed anchor, and
the hour of complines 8 I made sixty-five leagues of four miles each ; and not only was the wind not violent, but
on the contrary very gentle, which confirmed me in the conclusion that in sailing southward there is a continu ous ascent, while there is a corresponding descent to wards the north. I hold it for certain that the waters of the sea move from east to west with the sky, and that in passing this track they hold a more rapid course, and have thus eaten away large tracts of land, and hence has resulted this great number of islands ; indeed, these islands them

selves afford an additional proof of it, for on the one
hand, all those which lie west and east, or a little more
obliquely north-west and south-east, are broad; while those which lie north and south or north-east and south
west, that is in a directly contrary direction to the said winds, are narrow ; furthermore, that these islands should
possess the most costly productions is to be accounted for by the mild temperature, which comes to them from heaven, since these are the most elevated parts of the world. It is true that in some parts the waters do not appear to take this course, but this only occurs in certain
spots where they are obstructed by land, and hence they appear to take different directions. . . . I now return to my subject of the land of Gracia,
and of the river and lake found there, which latter might
more properly be called a sea ; for a lake is but a small expanse of water, which, when it becomes great, deserves the name of a sea, just as we speak of the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea ; and I think that if the river men
tioned does not proceed from the terrestrial Paradise, it comes from an Immense tract of land situated in the south, of which hitherto no knowledge has been obtained. But the more I reason on the subject the more satisfied I become that the terrestrial Paradise is situated in the
spot I have described ; and I ground my opinion upon the arguments and authorities already quoted. May it
please the Lord to grant your Highnesses a long life, and health and peace, to follow out so noble an investigation ; in which I think our Lord will receive great service, Spain considerable increase of its greatness, and all Christians much consolation and pleasure, because by this
means the name of our Lord will be published abroad.1
Alas for the hope of settling the problem of Eden s site by actual exploration ! Columbus never

lived to find his Paradise ; and geographers have long ago ascertained that the golden summit of the
world is not in Venezuela, nor in any of its neighbor
states. Of course Columbus supposed himself to be off the eastern coast, not of a new continent, but of Asia. His idea of the location of the terrestrial Paradise as in, or to the eastward of, Farther India was the prevailing idea of his age. The Hereford map of the world, dating from the thirteenth century, represents the favored spot as a circular island to the East of India, and as separated from the mainland, not only by the sea, but also by a battlemented wall, with its one gate to the West, through which our
first parents were supposed to have been expelled. Hugo de St. Victor wrote :
&quot; Paradise is a spot in the Orient productive of all kinds of woods and
pomiferous trees. It contains the Tree of Life ; there is neither cold nor heat there, but perpetually
an equable temperature. It contains a fountain which flows forth in four rivers.&quot; So Gautier de
Metz, in a poem written in the thirteenth century, describes the terrestrial Paradise as situated in
an unapproachable region in Asia, surrounded by flames, and guarded at its only gate by an armed
angel. In the year 1322 Sir John de Maundeville made his memorable pilgrimage to the East. In his ac count of these travels, after describing the marvel ous kingdom of Prester John in India, he says : &quot;And beyond the land and isles and deserts of
Prester John s lordship, in going straight towards
the East men find nothing but mountains and great
rocks ; and there is the dark region where no man

may see, neither by day nor by night, as they of the
country say. And that desert and that place of darkness lasts from this coast unto terrestrial Para dise, where Adam, our first father, and Eve were put, who dwelt there but a little while ; and that is
towards the East, at the beginning of the earth. . . . Of Paradise I cannot speak properly, for I was not
there. It is far beyond ; and I repent not going there, but I was not worthy. But as I have heard
say of wise men beyond I shall tell you with good
will. Terrestrial Paradise, as wise men say, is the
highest place of the earth ; and it is so high that it nearly touches the circle of the moon there, as the
moon makes her turn. For it is so high that the flood of Noah might not come to it, that would have covered all the earth of the world all about and above and beneath except Paradise. And this Para dise is inclosed all about with a wall, and men know not whereof it is ; for the wall is covered all over with moss as it seems : and it seems not that the wall is natural stone. And that wall stretches from the South to the North ; and it has but one entry,
which is closed with burning fire, so that no man
that is mortal dare enter. And in the highest place
of Paradise, exactly in the middle, is a well that casts out four streams, which run by divers lands, of which the first is called Pison, or Ganges, that runs throughout India or Emlak, in which river are
many precious stones, and much lignum, aloes, and
much sand of gold. And the other river is called
Nile, or Gyson, which goes through Ethiopia, and
after through Egypt. And the other is called Tigris which runs by Assyria and by Armenia the Great.
And the other is called Euphrates, which runs

through Media, Armenia, and Persia. And men there beyond say that all the sweet waters of the
world, above and beneath, take their beginning from the well of Paradise ; and out of that well all waters
come and go.&quot;

Various writers and map-makers of the same age
seem very evidently to have identified the Paradise of Genesis with the island of Ceylon. Even to this day a mount near the centre of the island bears the
name of &quot;Adam s Peak.&quot; According to Moham
medan tradition, this was only so called because it
was the place where Adam alighted when cast out of the true celestial Paradise in heaven. Neverthe less, Christian tradition or legend long lingered about
Ceylon as the genuine site of primitive Eden. 2 In entire accord with this view is the remarkable story of Prince Eirek, as told in an Icelandic Saga
of the fourteenth century. Mr. Baring-Gould, in a style not very reverent, has summarized the tale as follows :
1 Early Travels in Palestine. Edited by Thos. Wright, London,
1848, p. 276. 2 Even Maundeville, whose Paradise, as we have seen, was still farther to the East, found here a Fountain of Youth whose head spring was in Paradise :
&quot; Toward the head of that forest is the cytee
of Polombe [Columbo], and above the cytee is a great mountayne,
also clept Polombe. And of that mount the Cytee hathe his name.
And at the foot of that Mount is a fayr welle and a gret, that hathe odour and savour of all spices ; and at every hour of the day he
chaungethe his odour and his savour dyversely. And whoso drynkethe 3 times fasting of that watre of that welle, he is hool of alle
maner sykenesse that he hathe. And thei that duellen there and drynken often of that welle, thei nevere have sykenesse and thei semen alle weys yonge. I have dronken there of 3 or 4 sithes ; and zit, methinkethe, I fare the better. Some men clepen it the Welle of Youthe ; for thei that often drynken thereat semen alle weys
youngly and lyven withouten sykenesse. And men seyn, that that welle comethe out of Paradys ; and therefore it is so vertuous.&quot;



IO PARADISE FOUND.
Eirek was a son of Thrand, king of Drontheim, and having taken upon him a vow to explore the Deathless Land he went to Denmark, where he picked up a friend of the same name as himself. They then went to Con
stantinople, and called upon the Emperor, who held a long conversation with them, which is duly reported, rela tive to the truths of Christianity and the site of the
Deathless Land, which, he assures them, is nothing more nor less than Paradise.
&quot; The world,&quot; said the monarch, who had not forgotten his geography since he left school, &quot;is precisely 180,000 stages round (about 1,000,000 English miles), and it is not propped up on posts, not a bit ! it is supported by the power of God ; and the distance between earth
and heaven is 100,045 m ^es (another MS. reads 9382 miles ; the difference is immaterial) ; and round about the earth is a big sea called Ocean.&quot;
&quot; And what s to
the south of the earth ?
&quot; asked Eirek. &quot; Oh ! there is
the end of the world, and that is India.&quot; &quot; And pray where am I to find the Deathless Land ?
&quot; &quot; That lies
Paradise, I suppose you mean well, it lies slightly east
of India.&quot;
Having obtained this information, the two Eireks started, furnished with letters from the Greek Emperor.
They traversed Syria, and took ship, probably at Balsora ; then, reaching India, they proceeded on their jour ney on horseback, till they came to a dense forest, the
gloom of which was so great, through the interlacing of the boughs, that even by day the stars could be observed twinkling, as though they were seen from the bottom of a
well. On emerging from the forest, the two Eireks came
upon a strait, separating them from a beautiful land, which was unmistakably Paradise ; and the Danish
Eirek, intent on displaying his Scriptural knowledge, pro nounced the strait to be the river Pison. This was
crossed by a stone bridge, guarded by a dragon.



RESULTS OF EXPLORERS. II
The Danish Eirek, deterred by the prospect of an en counter with this monster, refused to advance, and even endeavored to persuade his friend to give up the attempt to enter Paradise as hopeless, after that they had come within sight of the favored land. But the Norseman de
liberately walked, sword in hand, into the maw of the dragon, and the next moment, to his infinite surprise and delight, found himself liberated from the gloom of the
monster s interior, and safely placed in Paradise. The land was most beautiful, and the grass as gor geous as purple ; it was studded with flowers, and was traversed by honey rills. The land was extensive and level, so that there was not to be seen mountain or hill, and the sun shone cloudless, without night and darkness ; the calm of the air was great, and there was but a feeble murmur of wind, and that which there was breathed red olent with the odor of blossoms. After a short walk, Eirek observed what certainly must have been a remark
able object, namely, a tower or steeple self-suspended in the air, without any support whatever, though access might be had to it by means of a slender ladder. By this Eirek ascended into a loft of the tower, and found there an excellent cold collation prepared for him. After hav ing partaken of this he went to sleep, and in vision beheld and conversed with his guardian angel, who promised to conduct him back to his fatherland, but to come for him again and fetch him away from it forever at the ex piration of the tenth year after his return to Drontheim. Eirek then retraced his steps to India, unmolested by
the dragon, which did not affect any surprise at having to disgorge him, and, indeed, which seems to have been, notwithstanding his looks, but a harmless and passive
dragon. After a tedious journey of seven years, Eirek reached his native land, where he related his adventures, to the confusion of the heathen, and to the delight and edifi cation of the faithful. And in the tenth year, and at

break of day, as Eirek went to prayer, God s Spirit caught him away, and he was never seen again in this world : so here ends all we have to say of him.
Here we get farther than with Columbus, but however beautiful and credible this story of Eden
exploration may have been five hundred years ago,
we now know that the only Paradise in Ceylon is a symbolical Buddhist one,1 as far removed from the primitive garden of Genesis as Roman Catholic &quot; Cal varies&quot; in South America are from the primitive Calvary of the crucifixion. Moreover, even the scribes of five hundred years ago, however credulous in other things, seem well to have understood the
true character of this story of travel, for &quot; according
to the majority of the MSS. the story purports to be
nothing more than a religious novel.&quot; 2
As the Keltic terrestrial Paradise, Avalon, was a sea-girt island in the waters of the North, it could of course be reached only by ship. The first to ac complish this feat, so far as Christian legend informs
us, was St. Brandan, son of Finlogho, a celebrated saint of the Irish Church, who died A. D. 576 or
577. According to the story an angel brought to this good abbot a book from heaven, in which such marvelous things were narrated concerning the then unknown portions of the world that the honest fa
ther charged both angel and book with falsehood,

and in his righteous indignation burned the latter. As a punishment for his unbelief God sentenced
him to recover the book. He must search through hell and earth and sea until he finds the heavenly
gift. The token given him by the angel is that
when he sees two twin fires flame up he shall know that they are the two eyes of a certain ox, and on the tongue of that ox he shall find the book. For seven long years he sails the Western and the Northern
Ocean. 1 He here encounters more marvels than were recorded in the original incredible book, and
is even permitted to visit the earthly Paradise. The beauty of the soil, of the fountain with four streams, of the magnificent castle and castle halls lighted with self-luminous stones and adorned with all man
ner of precious jewels, surpassed description. The stay of the party seems, however, to have been short, and unfortunately just where the island was located the commander forgets to mention.
A more elaborate and fanciful picture of the same mediaeval Paradise is furnished us in the story of
Oger, or Holger, a Danish knight of the age of Charlemagne. In a plain prose rendering, this is the style in which a famous court minstrel of six hundred years ago was accustomed to chant the adventure to admiring audiences.
Caraheu and Gloriande were in a boat with a fair company, and Oger had with him a thousand men-at
arms. When they were a certain way on, there arose so
mighty a tempest that they knew not what to do, only to commit their souls to God. So great was the storm that the mast of Oger s ship brake, and he was constrained to

14 PARADISE FOUND.
embark in a little vessel with a few of his comrades, and the wind struck them with such fury that they lost sight of Caraheu. Caraheu was so sore troubled that he was like to die, and he began to mourn the noble Oger ; for
he wist not what was become of the boat. And Oger in like manner lamented Caraheu. Thus grieved Caraheu and the Christians in his company, saying,
&quot; Alas ! Oger, what is become of thee ? This is, I ween, the most sud
den departure that I heard of ever.&quot;
&quot; Nay, but cease, my beloved,&quot; said Gloriande ;
&quot; he will not fail to come
again when God wills, for he cannot be far away.&quot;
&quot; Ah,
lady,&quot; said Caraheu, &quot;you know not the dangers of the sea ; and I pray God to take him into his keeping.&quot; . . .
Now I will leave speaking of Caraheu, and return to
Oger, who was in peril, yet was ever grieving for his friend, and saying,
&quot; Ah, Caraheu, hope of the remaining
days of my life, thou whom I loved next to God ! How
has God allowed me to lose so soon you and your lady ?
&quot;
At that moment the great ship, in which Oger had left
his men-at-arms, struck against a rock, and he saw them
all perish, at which sight he was like to die of grief. And presently a loadstone rock began to draw towards it the boat in which Oger was. Oger, seeing himself thus taken, recommended his soul to God, saying,
&quot; My God, my
Father and Creator, who hast made me in Thine image
and semblance, have pity on me now, and leave me not here to die ; for that I have used my power as was best to the increase of the Catholic faith. But if it must be that Thou take me, I commit to Thy care my brother
Guyou, and all my relatives and friends, especially my
rephew Gautier, who is minded to serve Thee, and bring
the paynim into Thy Holy Church. . . . Ah, my God !
had I known the peril of this adventure, I should never have abandoned the beauty, sense, and honor of Clarice,
Queen of England. Had I but gone back to her, I should have seen, too, my redoubted sovereign, Charlemagne,
witn all the princes who surround him.&quot;



RESULTS OF EXPLORERS. 15
Meanwhile the boat continued to float upon the water till it reached the loadstone castle, which they call the Chateau d Avalon, which is but a little way from the
earthly Paradise, whither were snatched in a beam of fire Elias and Enoch, and where was Morgue la Fe e, who at his birth had given him such great gifts. Then the manners saw well that they were drawing near to the
loadstone rock, and they said to Oger, &quot; My lord, com
mend thyself to God, for it is certain that at this moment we are come to our voyage s end ;
&quot; and as they spake the bark with a swing attached itself to the rock, as though it were cemented there. That night Oger thought over the case in which he was, but he scarce could tell of what sort it might be.
And the sailors came and said to Oger,
&quot; My lord, we are held here without remedy ; wherefore let us look to our
stores, for we are here for the remainder of our lives.&quot; To which Oger made answer, &quot; If this be so, then will I make consideration of our case, for I would assign to each one his share, to the least as to the greatest.&quot; For him
self Oger kept a double portion, for it is the law of the
sea that the master of the ship has as much as two others. But if that rule had not been, he would still have needed a double quantity, for he ate as much as two common men. When Oger had apportioned his share to each, he
said,
&quot; Masters, be sparing, I pray you, of your food as much as you may, for so soon as ye have no more be sure
that I myself will throw you into the sea.&quot; The skipper answered him, &quot; My lord, thou wilt escape no better than
we.&quot; Their food failed them all, one after another, and Oger cast them into the sea, and he remained alone. Then he was so troubled that he knew not what to do. &quot; Alas ! my God, my Creator,&quot; said he,
&quot; hast Thou at this hour forsaken me ? I have now no one to comfort me in
my misfortune.&quot; Thereupon, whether it were his fantasy or no, it seemed to him that a voice replied,
&quot; God orders



1 6 PARADISE FOUND.
that so soon as it be night thou go to a castle after thou hast come to an island which thou wilt presently find. And when thou art on the island thou wilt find a small path leading to the castle. And whatsoever thing thou
seest there, let not that affray thee.&quot; And Oger looked, but wist not who had spoken. Oger waited the return of night, to learn the truth of that which the voice foretold, and he was so amazed that he wist not what to do, but set himself to the trial. And when night came he committed himself to God, praying
Him for mercy ; and straightway he looked and beheld the
Castle of Avalon, which shone wondrously. Many nights before he had seen it, but by day it was not visible. Howbeit, so soon as Oger saw the castle he set about to
get there. He saw before him the ships that were fastened to the loadstone rock, and now he walked from ship to ship, and so gained the island; and when there he at once set himself to scale the hill by a path which he found.
When he reached the gate of the castle, and sought to enter, there came before him two great lions, who stopped him and cast him to the ground. But Oger sprang up
and drew his sword, Curtain, and straightway cleft one of them in twain ; then the other sprang and seized Oger by the neck, and Oger turned round and struck off his head.
When Oger had performed this deed, he gave thanks to our Lord, and then he entered the hall of the castle, where he found many viands, and a table set as if one should dine there ; but no prince nor lord could he see.
Now he was amazed to find no one, save only a horse, which sat at the table as if it had been a human being.
This horse, which was called Papillon (Psyche ?), waited
upon Oger, gave him to drink from a golden goblet, and at length conducted him to his chamber, and to a bed whose fairy-made coverlet of cloth of gold and ermine
was la plus mignonne chose quifutjamais vue.
When Oger awoke he thought to see Papillon again,



RESULTS OF EXPLORERS. l*J
but could see neither him, nor man, nor woman, to show
him the way from the room. He saw a door, and, having
made the sign of the cross, sought to pass out that way ; but as he tried to do this he encountered a serpent, so hideous that the like has scarce been seen. It would have thrown itself upon Oger, but that the knight drew his sword and made the creature recoil more than ten feet ; but it returned with a bound, for it was very mighty,
and the twain fell to fight. And now, as Oger saw that
the serpent pressed hard upon him, he struck at it so doughtily with his sword that he severed it in twain. After that Oger went along a path which led him to a garden, so beauteous that it was in truth a little paradise ;
and within were fair trees, bearing fruit of every kind, of tastes divers, and of such sweet odors that he never smelt trees like them before.
Oger, seeing these fruits so fine, desired to eat some,
and presently he lighted upon a fine apple-tree, whose fruit was like gold, and of these apples he took one and ate. But no sooner had he thus eaten than he became so sick and weak that he had no power nor manhood
left. And now again he commended his soul to God and
prepared to die. . . . But -at this moment turning round, he was aware of a fair dame, clothed in white, and so
richly adorned that she was a glory to behold. Now as Oger looked upon the lady without moving from his
place, he deemed that she was Mary the Virgin, and said,
&quot; Ave Maria,&quot; and saluted her. But she said,
&quot;
Oger,
think not that I am she whom you fancy ; I am she who
was at your birth, and my name is Morgue la Fee, and I allotted you a gift which was destined to increase your
fame eternally through all lands. But now you have left your deeds of war to take with ladies your solace ; for as soon as I have taken you from here I will bring you to Avalon, where you will see the fairest noblesse in the
world.&quot;
And anon she gave him a ring, which had such virtue



1 8 PARADISE FOUND.
that Oger, who was near a hundred years old, returned to the age of thirty. Then said Oger,
&quot; Lady, I am more beholden to thee than to any other in the world. Blessed
be the hour of thy birth, for, without having done aught
to deserve at your hands, you have given me countless gifts, and this gift of new life above them all. Ah, lady,
that I were before Charlemagne, that he might see the
condition in which I now stand ; for I feel in me greater strength than I have ever known. Dearest, how can I
make return for the honor and great good you have done
me ? But I swear that I am at your service all the days
of my life.&quot; Then Morgue took him by the hand, and
said,
&quot; My loyal friend, the goal of all my happiness, I
will now lead you to my palace in Avalon, where you will see of noblesse the greatest and of damosels the fairest.&quot;
And she took Oger by the hand and led him to the Cas
tle of Avalon, where was King Artus, and Auberon, and
Malambron, who was a sea fairy. As Oger approached the castle the fairies came to
meet him, dancing and singing marvellous sweetly. And he saw many fairy dames, richly crowned and apparelled.
And presently came Arthur, and Morgue called to him,
and said,
&quot; Come hither, my lord and brother, and salute the fair flower of chivalry, the honor of the French no
blesse, him in whom all generosity and honor and every virtue are lodged, Oger le Danois, my loyal love, my
only pleasure, in whom lies for me all hope of happiness.&quot; Then Morgue gave Oger a crown to wear, which was so rich that none here could count its value ; and it had be side a wondrous virtue, for every man who bore it on his brow forgot all sorrow and sadness and melancholy, and he thought no more of his country nor of his kin that he had left behind him in the world. We leave Oger thus &quot; bien assis et entretenu des dames
que fetait merveilles&quot; and return to the earth, where things were not going so well ; for while Oger was in Fairie the paynim assembled all their forces and took



RESULTS OF EXPLORERS. 19
Jerusalem and proceeded to lay siege to Babylon (that is, Cairo). Then the most valiant knights who were left on
earth Moysant, and Florian, and Caraheu, and Gautier (Oger s nephew) assembled all their powers to defend this place. But they lamented greatly because Oger was
no more. And a great battle took place without the walls of Babylon, in which the Saracens, assisted by a
renegade, the Admiral Gandice, gained the victory. Oger had been long in the Castle of Avalon, and had
begotten a son by Morgue, when she, having heard of these doings and of the danger to Christendom, deemed it needful to awake Oger from his blissful forgetfulness
of all earthly things, and tell him that his presence was needed in this world once more. Thereupon follows an account of Oger s returning to earth, where no one knew him, and all were astonished at his strange garb and
bearing. He inquired for Charlemagne, who had been long since dead ; the generation below Oger had grown
to be old men, yet he still had the habit of a man of
thirty. We need not wonder that his talk excited suspi
cion. But at length he made himself known to the King
of France, joined his army, and put the paynim to flight.
He had now forgotten his life in Fairie ; he was beloved by the Queen of France (the King having been killed),
and was about to marry her, when Morgue again ap
peared and carried him off to Avalon. 1
Looking back over this long story to see just
where it locates its Paradise, and how one could get
there, we find the data extremely few and discourag
ing. And the older story in Plutarch respecting

marks, &quot;The account which I here translate is only a sixteenth-cen
tury version of the tale, but it is copied directly from the poetic ver
sion of the well-known troubadour Adenez, chief minstrel at the court of Henry III. of Bavaria (1248-1261), and for his excellence in
his art called Le Roy, or king of all. There can be no doubt that in its chief particulars the story is far older than the days of Adenez.&quot;

the same isle of blessedness is not less destitute of indications as to exact locality. 1 Going some centuries farther back we find an other traveler who claims to have been in the ter
restrial Paradise. He says,
As I looked towards the North, over the mountains, I saw seven mountains full of precious balsam and odorous
trees and cinnamon and pepper. And from thence I went over the summits of these mountains far towards the East, and passed on still farther over the sea and came
far beyond it. And I came into the Garden of Right
eousness, and saw a many-colored crowd of trees of every kind ; for many and great trees flourish there, very noble
and lovely, and the Tree of Wisdom, which gives wisdom to any one who eats of it. It is like the Johannis bread
tree ; its fruit is like a cluster of grapes, very good ; and
the fragrance of the tree spreads far around. And I said, &quot; Fair is this tree, and how beautiful and ravishing its look !
&quot; And the holy Angel Raphael, who was with me, answered and said to me, &quot; This is the Tree of Wisdom of
which thy forefathers, thy hoary first parent and thy aged first mother, ate, and found the knowledge of wisdom, and their eyes were opened, and they knew that they were naked, and were driven out of the garden.&quot;
This favored explorer, who had the special advan
tage of being guided by a holy angel, was the un
known author of the Book of Enoch, which writing is believed by some to be as old as the second cen
tury before Christ. No one can read many chapters of his production, however, without arriving at the firm conclusion that sacred geography has very lit tle to hope from such a source, however ancient. 2

Coming down to the travelers of our own time, we fare no better, even though they do not tax our
credulity with stories of angelic guides or of guard ian dragons. One, writing only ten years ago, pro fessedly from the very Garden itself, momentarily
raises our expectations when he says,
&quot; Discoveries made within the last decade tend to confirm the sup position that the primeval abode of man was near the confluence of the Euphrates and the Tigris ;
and it is not too much to anticipate the exhuming of inscribed tablets which will fully establish this be
lief.&quot; But as suddenly as our hopes are excited, so
suddenly do they die away in disappointment. In credulous critics greet the suggestion of &quot;exhuming inscribed tablets&quot; on the subject with a chorus of derisive laughter. The author himself does not ven ture to give any of the &quot; discoveries made within the last decade &quot; which tend to confirm the notion that Eden was located at the point described. On the
contrary, in the immediately following sentence, he takes leave of the subject, and in so doing gives us over to his own admitted uncertainty in the follow ing terms :
&quot; And although, after the lapse of so
many centuries, exact correspondence of topography is not to be expected, yet guided by the general fea tures of the scene rather than by the minuter ones, the present traditional Garden of Eden may be ac cepted until another has been discovered and its
identity more clearly proved.&quot;
l In such darkness dies out the kindled hope. Meantime, in a letter to

the problem of the site of Eden. To this day the word of Pindar, uttered half a thousand years before Christ, has remained true :

To the Hyperborean Field Shalt thou find the wondrous way.&quot;

It has been placed under the northern

THEOLOGIANS, Christian and Jewish, have in all
ages differed, and irreconcilably differed, as to the location of the cradle of the human race. The evi dences of this are so well known, or so easily acces
sible to every intelligent reader, that they need not be adduced in this place. 1 The fathers and theologians of the Early Church and of the Middle Ages held many curious and con
flicting opinions upon the subject. Some, following
the allegorizing method of Philo, interpreted the whole narrative in Genesis as a parable setting forth
spiritual things. Eden was not a place, but a state of spiritual blessedness. The four rivers were not rivers, but the four cardinal virtues, etc. The majority, however, held to the historic character of
the narrative, and to the strictly geographical reality
1 See McClintock and Strong, Cyclopedia of Biblical, Theological,
and Ecclesiastical Literature, Arts. &quot; Eden &quot; and &quot; Paradise.&quot;



24 PARADISE FOUND.
of Eden. To the question of its location, number less were the answers. Often it was in the far East, beyond all lands inhabited by men. Sometimes it
was thought of as perhaps within, or under, the earth, in the regions of the dead. Sometimes it was neither on nor below the earth, but high above it, in the third heaven, or some way associated with the lunar orbit. Again, it would be stated that there
are two paradises, a celestial and a terrestrial one, the one in heaven, the other on the earth. Ter
tullian, conceiving of the torrid zone as the flaming sword, which turned every way to keep the way of
the tree of life (Gen. iii. 24), placed Eden beyond
it, in the southern hemisphere. Now it was at the bottom of the sea ;
l or again it held a position mid way between earth and heaven. Anon, it was on the summit of a miraculous mountain, which rose to the height of the moon. Of this mountain only the base was washed, when by the waters of the Deluge all other mountains were covered. It was conceived
of as rising in three gigantic stages to its stupen dous height. All kinds of marvelous plants and precious metals and gems adorned it, but its su preme adornment was a divine river, which, starting
from the throne of God in the highest heaven, descended to the holy garden on the mountain s
head, and thence parting into four, after watering and beautifying the whole mountain in its descent, gradually lost more and more of its celestial taste
and vivifying virtues, and became the water system of the habitable globe. Sometimes the location of
1 &quot;In some legends Eden was submerged by the earliest deluge
that covered the Mount. The happy garden was believed to be lying at the bottom of Lake Van, in Armenia.&quot; Gerald Massey, The Nat*
ural Genesis, vol. ii., p. 231.



THE RESULTS OF THEOLOGIANS. 2$
this mountain was described as in some distant por
tion of the earth, &quot; where the sea, or earth, and the
sky meet.&quot;
Impatient of such contradictions, Luther, in his own brusque way, rejected all attempts to locate the
primeval garden, declaring that the Deluge had so changed the face of the earth and the course of its
original rivers that all search was fruitless.
Calvin, on the contrary, confidently affirmed that the writer of the Genesis narrative must be under stood as locating the Garden of Eden near the mouths of the Euphrates. Soon this original diver sity of Protestant teaching upon the subject became aggravated by new theories, some of them suggested by orthodox ingenuity, some introduced by rational
istic conceptions of the semi-mythical character of the Bible, until at the present time the state of the
ological teaching respecting Eden is, if possible, a worse Babel than in any preceding age. For a partial illustration of the confusion one has only to turn to the most recent and authoritative
biblical, theological, and religious encyclopaedias. In McClintock and Strong s, the writer on Eden in clines to locate it in Armenia. In Smith s &quot; Bible
Dictionary&quot; the problem is abandoned as probably
insoluble. In the great German encyclopaedia of Herzog it is declared necessary to deny to the story
of Eden a strictly historical character ; it is &quot; a bit of
mythical geography.&quot; In the supplement, however, Pressel makes an elaborate argument of many pages in favor of the location at the junction of the Tigris
and Euphrates. Dillmann, in Schenkel s &quot; Bibel
Lexicon,&quot; places it in the Himalayas, north of India.
In the chief Roman Catholic cyclopaedia, Wetzel

and Welte s &quot; Kirchen - Lexicon,&quot; the writer vacil lates between Eastern Asia, taken in a vague and undefined sense, and an equally undefined North.
In Lichtenberg s just completed &quot; Encyclopedic des Sciences Religieuses
&quot; the whole story in Genesis ii.
is declared a &quot;philosophic myth.&quot; Professor Brown,
of New York, in the new work edited by Dr. Schaff,
on the basis of Herzog, enumerates a variety of opinions advocated by others, but refrains from ex
pressing any opinion of his own. Such is all the
light which contemporary theology seems able to throw upon our problem. But here some plain reader of the Bible opens at
the second chapter of Genesis, and reads, &quot;And
the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden ;
and there he put the man whom he had formed.&quot;
And the plain reader asks how a believer in the Bible can doubt that this passage fixes the location of the garden somewhere to the East of Palestine.
But, looking a little more critically, our inquirer himself quickly sees that the verse does not neces sarily affirm anything as to the direction of the gar
den from the writer. It may naturally mean that the
garden was planted in the eastern part of the land of Eden, wherever that was ; and turning to the most careful and orthodox commentators, he finds that not a few take this view of it. Moreover, Miqqedem y here translated &quot;
eastward,&quot; may be other
wise translated, as it is in King James s Version, in the passages Ps. Ixxiv. 12, Ixxvii. 6, and elsewhere.
In fact, in the Vulgate it is here translated, a prin
cipio,
&quot; in or from the beginning.&quot; Among the early Greek translators, Symmachus, Theodotion, and Aquila understand the term in the same way,



THE RESULTS OF THEOLOGIANS. 2?
Hence, nearly two hundred years ago, the learned Thomas Burnet wrote as follows: &quot;Some have
thought that the word Miqqedem, Gen. ii. 8, was to be rendered in the East, or Eastward, as we read it, and therefore determined the site of Paradise ; but
t is only the Septuagint translate it so ; all the
other Greek versions, and St. Jerome, the Vulgate, the Chaldee Paraphrase, and the Syriak, render it
from the beginning, or in the beginning, or to that
effect. And we that do not believe the Septuagint to have been infallible or inspired have no reason to
prefer their single authority above all the rest.&quot; 1
The same writer says again,
&quot; We may safely say that none of the Christian Fathers, Latin or Greek,
ever placed Paradise in Mesopotamia ; that is a con ceit and innovation of some modern authors, which
hath been much encouraged of late, because it gave more ease and rest as to further inquiries in an
argument they could not well manage.&quot; 2
As to the new source of evidence opened up by
the decipherment of the Cuneiform inscriptions, Lenormant says, that in none of these, so far as yet
deciphered, has anything been found indicating that the Chaldaeo-Babylonians believed that their coun
try was the cradle of the human race. 3
&quot; But the four rivers,&quot; says our inquirer, and he reads verses 10-14: &quot;And a river went out of Eden to water the garden ; and from thence it was
parted and became into four heads. The name of
the first is Pison. . . . And the name of the second river is Gihon. . . . And the name of the third river

is Hiddekel, . . . and the fourth river is Euphrates.&quot; &quot; Surely here in the fourth river we have one unde niable landmark. However impossible it may be
satisfactorily to identify all four of the primitive riv ers of Eden, the mention of the Euphrates at least restricts the location of the garden to some part of
the region drained by that river.&quot;
Consulting the theologians, however, our inves tigator finds a great variety of serious objections urged against this short and easy method of settling
the controversy. First, he is told that some Biblical critics have
expressed doubt as to the genuineness of the verses, and that as earnest a defender of the Bible as Mr. Granville Penn considered the whole passage an in
terpolation. Secondly, he learns that Perath or Phrath, the
Hebrew name of the river, is from the older form Buratti or Purattu, a word believed to signify
&quot; the
broad,&quot; or &quot; the deep.&quot;
1 Of course such a descrip tive term may well have been the name of more
than one ancient river, just as &quot;Broad Brook&quot; is the
name of many an American stream. Indeed, in his
learned work, &quot; Le Berceau de 1 Espece Humaine,&quot; Obry shows that in ancient times Phrat, or Euphra
tes, was the name of one, or possibly two, of the
rivers of Persia. 2 One of these in Pliny s time still
bore the name in the hardly changed form Ophradus. Lenormant says he does not hesitate to consider the Phrath of the Khorda-Avesta identical with the Per

sian river Helmend.1 Africa also had its sacred Euphrates.2 If therefore the passage in Genesis is genuine, and Moses wrote of the Phrath, it is not
absolutely certain what &quot; broad &quot; or &quot; abounding
&quot;
river he had in mind. Moreover, in any case, the
Euphrates of Mesopotamia is not one of four equal offshoots into which the one &quot; river &quot;
proceeding &quot; out of Eden &quot; divided itself according to the state ment of the text. Its source is not from another river at all, but from ordinary mountain springs.
Thirdly, it must not be forgotten, our friend is told, that all peoples coming into a new country love
to name their new rivers and towns after the loved and sacred ones they have left in the elder home.
The Thames of New England perpetuates the mem ory of the Thames of Old England. &quot; It is very
seldom indeed,&quot; says a late writer, &quot; that a river has
no namesakes.&quot; 3 Very possibly, therefore, the Phrath of Mesopotamia may have been named for
some elder river of the antediluvian world, wher ever that may have been. That it was so is the firm
belief of various learned writers. 4
Fourthly, continue the theologians, the language of Ezekiel xxviii. 13-19, and of Proverbs iii. 18; xi.
30, etc., shows that poetic and symbolical applica tions of the name and images of Eden were common.

in Britain two rivers named Trisanton. On the contrary, it is very seldom indeed that a river has no namesakes,&quot; Henry Bradley, in

3O PARADISE FOUND.
And if the Hebrews named one of the water-courses at Jerusalem Gihon, in commemoration of one of the four Paradise rivers, 1 it is not irrational to suppose that the inhabitants of Mesopotamia may have called their chief stream in honor of another of the four.
Lenormant, Grill, Obry, and others support this view. They might have rendered the probability still stronger by calling attention to the fact that the
oldest name of Babylon, Tin-tir-ki, was of the same
commemorative or symbolical character, and signi fied &quot; the place of the Tree of Life.&quot; 2
Finally, pursuing these curious investigations fur ther, our plain reader finds mention in Pausanias, ii.
5, of a strange belief of the ancients, according to
which the Euphrates, after disappearing in a marsh and flowing a long distance underground, rises again beyond Ethiopia, and flows through Egypt as the Nile. This reminds him of the language of Josephus,
according to which the Ganges, the Tigris, the Eu phrates, and the Nile are all but parts of &quot;one river
which ran round about the whole earth,&quot; the Okeanos-river of the Greeks. 3 And he wonders whether the old Shemitic term from which the modern Eu phrates is derived was not originally a name of the
general water system of the world, a name of that Ocean-river which Aristotle describes as rising in
the upper heavens, descending in rain upon the
earth, feeding, as Homer tells us, all fountains and
rivers and every sea, flowing through all these water

courses down into the great and &quot;broad&quot; equatorial
ocean-current which girdles the world in its embrace, thence branching out from the further shore into
the rivers of the Underworld, to be at last fire-purged
and sublimated, and returned in purity to the upper
heavens to recommence its round.1 And just as he is wondering over the question, he finds that some
of the Assyriologists, in their investigation of preBabylonian Akkadian mythology, have found reason to believe this surmise correct, and to say that in
that mythology the term Euphrates was applied to &quot; the rope of the world,&quot;
&quot; the encircling river of the
snake god of the tree of life,&quot; &quot;the heavenly river which surrounds the earth.&quot; 2 Furthermore, as he
turns back to the pages of Hyginus, and Manilius, and Lucius Ampelius, and reads of the fall of the
&quot;world-egg&quot; at the beginning &quot;into the river Eu phrates,&quot; he perceives that he is in a mythologic,
and not a historic region. 3 And when he lights upon a mutilated fragment of an ancient Assyrian
inscription, in which descriptions of the visible and invisible world are mixed up together, and in which the river &quot;of the life of the world &quot;
is designated by
the name &quot;
Euphrates,&quot; 4 he quickly concludes that it will not do to take the term Phrath, or Eu-frata,
as always and everywhere referring to the historic river of Mesopotamia.

Hitherto, then, the &quot;results&quot; of the theologians
as to the location of Eden are purely negative and
mutually destructive. &quot; It would be difficult,&quot; says one of their number, &quot;to find any subject in the whole history of opinion which has so invited and at the same time so completely baffled conjecture as
this. Theory after theory has been advanced, but none has been found which satisfies the required

// is useless to speculate on thit subject. CHARLES DARWIN.
THE location of the cradle of the human race is as
much a problem for the ethnologist and anthropolo gist as it is for the theologian. The archaeologist, the zoologist, and even the biologist, if at all broad
and philosophical in their inquiries, cannot ignore
the high interest of the questions, Was there for
the human race one primitive centre of distribution ? and, if so, Where was it located ?
Thirty years ago the pretentious American work by Nott and Gliddon, entitled &quot; The Types of Man
kind,&quot;
1 a work written in opposition to the doc trine of the unity of the human race, attracted unusual attention to the former of these questions.
The teaching therein put forth was that there are very many types or varieties of men without genea logical connection with each other, and that there fore a great number of primitive centres of distribu tion must be assumed. The avowed prejudices of
the projectors of the work against certain races, par ticularly the African, would have rendered the in fluence of the work upon the scientific world ex tremely slight, had not contributions of some value from Dr. S. G. Morton, and Professor Louis Agassiz

been incorporated with it. As it was, it gave Eu ropean ethnologists occasion to form and express very uncomplimentary conceptions of American rep resentatives of ethnological research.1 Fortunate ly these crude beginners of the science have had no influential successors of their own sort in this country, and but obscure or half-hearted disciples in any other. 2 The polygeny of the race has at
present no respectable support. Even the author of the latest and perhaps ablest of the works on the
Preadamite Hypothesis remarks, &quot; The plural origin
of mankind is a doctrine now almost entirely super seded. All schools admit the probable descent of all races from a common stock.&quot; 3 To the second
question, therefore, the attention of the scientific
and archaeological world is steadily gravitating. Given one primeval point of departure for the race, where shall that point of departure be sought ? The answers which recent biologists, naturalists, and ethnologists have given to this problem are hardly less numerous or less conflicting than are
the solutions proposed by theologians. Of these

answers Professor Zoeckler, in a late work, enumer ates ten, each having the support of eminent scien tific names. 1 In latitude they range from Green
land to Central Africa, and in longitude from Amer ica to Central Asia. Of the whole number, the two which seem to command the widest and weight
iest support are, first, the hypothesis that &quot; Lemu
ria &quot; a wholly imaginary, now submerged prehis toric continent under the northern portion of the
Indian Ocean was the &quot; mother-region
&quot; of the
race ; and, secondly, that it was in the heart of Cen tral Asia. The former of these sites is the one supported by Haeckel, Caspari, Peschel, and many others. 2 Though less positive, Darwin and Lyell seem favor able to the same location or to one in the adjoining portion of Africa. Most of the recent maps of the
progressive dispersion of the race over the globe have been constructed in accordance with this the
ory. 3 Perhaps the best popular summary of the arguments in its favor is that found in Oscar
Peschel s &quot; Races of Men.&quot; 4

36 PARADISE FOUND.
ethnographers have of late very strongly tended to place the cradle of mankind on the lofty plateau of Pamir in Central Asia. For these the eminent
French anthropologist, Quatrefages, is well entitled to speak.
We know [says this savant] that in Asia there is a vast region bounded on the south and south-west by the Himalayas, on the west by the Bolor mountains, on the north-west by the Alla-Tau, on the north by the Altai
range and its off-shoots, on the east by the Kingkhan, on the south and south-east by the Felina and Kwen-lun.
Judging of it by what exists at the present day, this great central region might be regarded as having included the
cradle of the human race. In fact, the three fundamental types of all the races
of mankind are represented in the populations grouped around this region. The negro races are the furthest re moved from it, but have nevertheless marine stations, in which they are found pure or mixed, from the Kiussiu
to the Andaman Islands. On the continent they have mingled their blood with nearly all the inferior castes and
classes of the two Gangetic peninsulas ; they are still found pure in each of them ; they ascend as far as Nepal,
and, according to Elphinstone, spread to the west as far as the Persian Gulf and Lake Zareh. The yellow race, pure, or mixed here and there with white elements, seems alone to occupy the area in question. The circumference
of this region is peopled by it to the north, the east, the south-east, and the west. In the south it is more mixed, but it none the less forms an important element of the
population. The white race, by its allophylian repre sentatives, seems to have disputed the possession of even the central area itself with the yellow race. In early times we find the Yu-Tchi, the U-Suns, to the north of Hoang-Ho ; and at the present day in Little Thibet, in
Eastern Thibet, small islands of white populations have



OTHER RESULTS. 37
been pointed out. The Miao-Tse occupy the mountain
ous regions of China ; the Siaputhes are proof against
all attacks in the gorges of Bolor. On the confines of this area we find to the east the Ainos and the Japanese
of high caste, the Tinguians of the Philippine Islands ;
to the south the Hindus. To the south-west and west,
the white element, pure or mixed, is completely predomi
nant. No other region on the face of the globe presents similar reunion of the extreme types of the human race distributed around a common centre. This fact of itself might suggest to the naturalist the conjecture which I have expressed above ; but we may appeal to other con siderations. One of the weightiest of these is drawn from philol ogy. The three fundamental forms of human language are found in the same regions and in analogous connec tions. In the centre and the south-east of our area the
monosyllabic languages are represented by the Chinese, the Annamite, the Siamese, and the Thibetan. As agglu tinative languages, we find, from the north-east to the
north-west, the group of the Ugro-Japanese ; in the south that of the Dravidians and the Malays ; and in the west the Turkish languages. Lastly, Sanscrit with its deriva
tives, and the Iranian languages, represent, in the south and south-west, the inflectional languages. With the lin guistic types accumulated around this central region of
Asia all human languages are connected, either by their
vocabulary or their grammar. Some of these Asiatic lan
guages resemble very closely languages spoken in regions far removed, or separated from the area in question by very different languages. Lastly, it is from Asia, again, that our earliest-tamed domestic animals have come. Isidore Geoffrey- SaintHilaire is entirely agreed on this point with Bureau de la Malle.
Thus, taking into account only the present epoch,



38 PARADISE FOUND.
everything leads us back to this central plateau, or rather this vast inclosure. Here, we are inclined to say to our
selves, the first human beings appeared, and multiplied down to the moment when the populations overflowed like a bowl which is too full, and poured themselves out
in human waves in all directions. 1
This view of the location of the first centre of the
race is very widely accepted. It has the support of
many great names. To its establishment contribu

The difficulty of accounting for the first advent of human beings in America, without supposing in early times a closer land-connection between the eastern and western hemispheres in the intertropical regions than now exists, has led not a few eth

pas, the Shat-en-Nil, and the lower Tigris and Eu
phrates. But despite the conceded ability of the plea, there seems at present little prospect that it will secure acceptance among scholars. The distin
guished Theodor Noeldeke, in a recent review, while
cordially praising the learning and ingenuity of the work, professes himself unmoved by its arguments.1 Similarly a critic in this country writes :
&quot; Unfortu
nately for the theory so powerfully advanced, almost all the linguistic evidences by which it is supported are still of doubtful value, the etymology of the
Babylonian names in most cases, and the reading in some, being disputed by high authorities in this ob
scure field of inquiry. Were the linguistic points proved, it would be hard to resist the power of the
argument, in spite of various difficulties arising from
the scanty text of Genesis itself. As it is, although all other solutions of the knotty Biblical problem
may be subject to still graver objections, the follow
ing questions militate too strongly against Professor Delitzsch s solution : Why, if the stream of Eden be the middle Euphrates, is it left unnamed in the nar rative, though it is certain that the Hebrews were perfectly familiar both with the middle and the up per course of that river ? Why, if the Pison and Gihon designate the canals Pallacopas and Shat-enNil, are they said to compass lands which the canals only traverse ? If the lower Tigris be meant by the Hiddekel, why is this river described as flowing in front of Assyria, which lay above the central Meso

Why should Cush, a name which commonly desig nated Ethiopia, have been used by the narrator in a sense in which it nowhere else occurs in the Scrip tures, without the least further definition ? Why,
on the other hand, is Havilah, if the Arabian border land so well known to the Hebrews be meant, so
fully described by its products ? Who tells us that
the gold, the bdellium, and the shoham of Babylonia were also characteristic of the adjoining Havilah ?
But whether these objections, in the present stage of Assyriological studies, be fatal to the theory of
Professor Delitzsch or not, we have no hesitation in
saying that his dissertation, amplified as it is by supplementary treatises on the ancient geography and ethnology of the Mesopotamian and neighbor ing countries, of Canaan, Egypt, and Elam, is a per fect treasury of knowledge, made most accessible by excellent indexes, and probably the most bril
liant production in all Biblico-Assyriological litera

no small influence upon the Greco-Roman mythol ogy in the development of such ideas as those per
taining to the Gardens of the Hesperides, the Isles
of the Blessed, etc. The site advocated is not new, though the line of argument is fresh and scholarly.
The hypothesis that the cradle of the race is to be sought in America has before found advocacy at the
hands of J. Klaproth, Gobineau, and others. That this, however, is not to be the last and only
word on the subject is evident from the fact that, in a huge work just from the press, an English writer says :
&quot; If there be an earthly original for the heav
enly Eden, it will be found in equatorial Africa, the land of seething, swarming, multitudinous, and co lossal life, where the mother nature grew great with her latest race ; the lair in which the lusty breeder
brought forth her black, barbarian brood, and put forth for them such a warm, welling bosom as can not be paralleled elsewhere on earth. This was the world of wet and heaven of heat ; the land of equal
day and dark ; that supplied the Two Truths of Uarti (Egyptian) ; the top of the world ; the very nipple (Kepd) of the breast of earth, which is there one vast streaming fount of moisture quick with
life. So surely as a topographical Meru is found
in Habesh, so surely is the Earthly Paradise, the original of the mythical which was carried forth over the world by the migrations from Kam, to be
found there, if at all.&quot; 1

In fine, so resultless seem all discussions and in vestigations in this field that in his work on &quot; The
Patriarchs of Humanity &quot; Dr. Julius Grill, like Noel
deke, prefers to locate lost Paradise &quot;in Utopia,&quot;
and to deny to it all historic reality.1 Evidently the naturalists and the ethnologists, the comparative
mythologists, and Kultnrgeschichtschreiber, have not yet solved the problem. Their &quot; mother-region
&quot; of
the human race is as elusive and Protean as are any
of the terrestrial Edens of theology, or of legend,
or of poetry. Thus far, then, all search has been fruitless. Par adise is indeed lost. The explorer cannot find it;
the theologian, the naturalist, and the archaeologist have all sought it in vain. Representative voices
out of every camp are heard confessing utter igno rance as to the region where human history began.
&quot; The problem,&quot; says Professor Ebers, &quot; remains un
answered.&quot;
he speaks of the crooked sword Khepsh, &quot; that turned every way, and by its revolution formed the circle of Eden, or, as it was represented, kept the way of the Tree of Life, the POLE, where the happy garden
was planted as the primary creation, which was the home of the pri

A NEW HYPOTHESIS.
CHAP.
I. THE HYPOTHESIS AND ITS ADMISSIBILITY. II. ITS EFFECT UPON THE PROBLEM AND ITS SOLUTION.



When Newton said &quot; Hypotheses non fingo &quot; he did not mean that he deprived himself of the facilities of investigation afforded by assuming in the first instance what he hoped ultimately to be able to prove. Without such assumptions science could never have attained its present state. JOHN STUART MILL.
In scientific investigations it is permitted to invent any hypothesis, and if it ex plains various large and independent classes of facts it rises to the rank of a wellgrounded theory. CHARLES DARWIN.



CHAPTER I.
THE HYPOTHESIS.
The golden guess Is morning star to the full round of truth. TENNYSON.
FROM the foregoing chapters it would seem as if
nearly every imaginable site for the Gan-Eden of Genesis had been proposed, examined, and found un available. One, however, remains, a region of rar est interest in astronomical, physical, and historical geography, the natural centre of the only historic
hemisphere. Considering the fascination of the sub ject and the inexhaustible ingenuity that has been expended upon it, it seems remarkable that it should be left to the closing years of the nineteenth cen
tury to bring forward and seriously to test the prop
osition THAT THE CRADLE OF THE HUMAN RACE, THE EDEN OF PRIMITIVE TRADITION, WAS SITUATED AT THE NORTH POLE, IN A COUNTRY SUBMERGED AT THE TIME OF THE DELUGE.1
1 As to the alleged &quot;newness&quot; of the above hypothesis, it is
proper to say that something like a year elapsed after its full accept ance and public announcement by the writer before he could find any evidence that it had ever been entertained or advocated by any other
person. He then met with the allusion in the passage quoted from Bishop Huet as a motto to chapter second of the preceding part, and with a similar allusion in an anonymous article in Dickens All the Year Round. Whether these were more than rhetorical flourishes he was long in doubt. Not until after the manuscript of the present work had been completed, packed, and addressed to the publishers,



48 PARADISE FOUND.
This is the hypothesis which it is proposed in the
following pages to examine and according to the
evidences to adjudge. We propose to make the test
both strict and comprehensive. Hypotheses, how ever promising, must be brought face to face with
reality. Ours, like its numberless predecessors, must be rejected if the solid facts of any of the fol lowing sciences show that it is inadmissible : 1. General Geogony, or the science of the origin of the earth ; 2. Mathematical or Astronomical Geography, par ticularly its teachings as to the inhabitableness or uninhabitableness of the circumpolar region with
respect to light ; 3. Physiographical Geology, particularly its teach
ings as to the probability or improbability of the former existence and subsequent submersion of a
circumpolar country ;
4. Prehistoric Climatology, particularly with ref erence to the temperature at the Pole at the time of
the beginning of human history ; 5. Paleontological Botany ; 6. Paleontological Zoology ;
7. Paleontological Anthropology and Ethnology ; and
8. Comparative Mythology, viewed as the science
was the doubt resolved by finding in an anonymous English magazine
article of more than thirty years ago this brief statement :
&quot; Pastellus will have it that Paradise was under the North Pole.&quot; Who Pastellus was and what he wrote upon the subject remain to be investigated. Suffice to say that up to the date of this writing the author has found no book or tractate in which the above hypothesis has ever been advocated. This fact renders some of the mottoes prefixed to the
chapters farther on remarkably significant and impressive. In many cases their authors express truths which they themselves did not
perceive.



PROPOSED HYPOTHESIS. 49
of the oldest traditionary beliefs and memories of
mankind. On the contrary, if the hypothesis is ca
pable of meeting this eightfold test, and especially if we can show, not only that it is admissible, but
also that in greater or less degree it is supported by the positive evidence of the facts in nearly all of
these fields of knowledge, we shall afford a much
more complete and convincing verification than is at all usual in matters of prehistoric research. 4



CHAPTER II.
IMPORTANT NEW FEATURES AT ONCE INTRODUCED INTO THE PROBLEM OF THE SITE OF EDEN. SIG NIFICANCE OF THESE FOR A VALID SOLUTION.
It appears, then, to be a condition of a genuinely scientific hypothesis that it be not destined always to remain an hypothesis, but be certain to be either proved or disproved by that comparison with observedfacts which is termed verification- . . Verification is proof ; if the supposition accords with the phenomena there needs no other evidence of it. JOHN STUART MILL.
IT is evident, on a moment s thought, that our
hypothesis immediately and materially modifies the whole problem of the location of Paradise.
Given a prehistoric circumpolar continent at the North Pole as the cradle of the race, what must have been marked and memorable features of that
primitive abode ? 1. To the first men there would have been but
one day and one night in a year.
2. The stars, instead of seeming to rise and set, would have had an apparently horizontal motion round and round the observer from left to right.
3. The Pole, the unmoving centre-point of the heavens directly overhead, would naturally have seemed to be the top of the world, the true heaven,
the changeless seat of the supreme, all-ruling God.
And if, accordingly, through all the long lifetime of the ante-diluvian world, the circumpolar sky was to human thought the true abode of God, the oldest
post-diluvian peoples, though scattered down the



EFFECT ON PROBLEM AND ITS SOLUTION. 51
sides of the globe half or two thirds the distance to
the equator, could not easily have forgotten that at the centre and true top of the rotating sky was the
throne of its great Creator, and that there, in the
far North, was &quot; the sacred quarter
&quot; of the world. 4. Standing at the Pole of the earth, an observer would be not only directly under the centre of the
celestial hemisphere, but also directly on the centre
of the surface of the terrestrial hemisphere. There, and there alone, the heavenly bodies would move, in horizontal planes, round and round him every
where at an apparently equal distance, and he would seem to himself to stand on the one precise centre
point of the entire earth. Every departure of a few miles in any direction from this polar position would
at once confirm this first impression. If, therefore, primeval Eden was at the Pole, the descendants of
the first man, going away from such an original country, could hardly have failed to remember it as the centre of all lands, the omphalos of the whole earth. 5. Supposing the first man to have been located in the central and most elevated portion of the hy
pothetical Eden-land, the streams there originating and flowing seaward would have flowed, not in one but in various opposite directions toward all the car dinal points of the horizon. Moreover, all of these
streams being obviously fed, not by each other, but by the rain from heaven, it would not have required
a very powerful imagination to conceive of them as parts of a finer and more celestial stream whose
head-springs were in the sky. 1 If, finally, the streams
1 Compare the poetic representation of &quot; the river of God,&quot; in Ps. Ixv. 9, 10. Also the following :
&quot; Aristotle, I remember, in his Me



52 PARADISE FOUND.
flowing in the opposite directions grew at length into four opposite-flowing rivers, flumina principalia, as many old theologians have called them, dividing the circumpolar land into four nearly equal quarters, it would have constituted a never-to-be-forgotten feature of that first home of men. 6. In another chapter we shall expose the base lessness of the popular impression that at the Pole six months of every twelve are spent in darkness, and shall show that, on the contrary, less than one fifth of the year is so spent, while more than four
fifths are spent in light. This being true, a primi tive abode in that part of the world would have been remembered by the descendants of the first man as
preeminently a land of beauty, preeminently the home of the sun. Moreover, Arctic explorers find it impossible to describe the nocturnal splendors of the Aurora Borealis in those regions, the whole top of the globe ofttimes seeming veiled in and
over-canopied with quivering curtains and banners and streamers of living, leaping flame ; it is there fore easy to believe that, once exiled from such a home, mankind would ever have looked back to it as
to an abode of unearthly and preternatural efful gence, a home fit for the occupancy of gods and holy immortals.
7. Finally, assuming the prevalence of an equable tropical temperature, we find the biological conditions of the region such as the extraordinary preva lence of daylight, the intenser terrestrial magnetism,
teors, speaking of the course of the Vapours, saith, there is a River
in the Air, constantly flowing betwixt the Heavens and the Earth, made by the ascending and descending Vapours.&quot; Burnet, Sacred Theory of the Earth, p. 226.



EFFECT ON PROBLEM AND ITS SOLUTION. 53
and the unparalleled electric forces which feed the
Northern Lights all combining to raise a high
probability that if ever such a land as we have sup
posed existed, it must have presented forms of life
surpassing those with which we are familiar ; a flora
and fauna of almost unimagined vigor and luxuriance
of development. Under such conditions men them
selves may well have had a stature and strength and
longevity never attained since the Deluge, which
destroyed &quot;the world that then was,&quot; and imme
diately or ultimately occasioned the translocation of
the seed of our new post-diluvian humanity into the cold and barren and desolate regions of the North
ern Temperate zone. And if the first men were of
the stature and strength and longevity supposed, how certainly would traditions of the fact linger in the memory of mankind long after its exile from its
earlier and happier home ! Glancing back now over these various points, one instantly sees that they present conditions of hu
man existence totally unlike the conditions of life as we know it, or as it has ever been known in what
are called historic ages. They necessarily modify in the profoundest manner the whole problem of the
site of Eden. No solution ever heretofore presented
exposed itself to refutation at so many points. None
ever before postulated so extraordinary an adjust ment of both heavens and earth. None ever before
required, in order to its establishment, so incredibly
wide a concurrency of testimony. Against no other has it ever been possible for the very stars in their
courses to fight. If false, it demands of human tra dition shadowy recollections of world - conditions
which have never existed in human experience. An



54 PARADISE FOUND.
hypothesis so peculiarly difficult must surely break down, if it be not true. Promising the reader, there
fore, not a new ignis-fatuus chase, but at least the satisfaction of a definite result as respects one hy
pothesis, we cordially invite his critical and patient attention to the facts to be presented in the follow
ing chapters.

It follows . . . that man, issuing from a &quot;mother-region

CHAPTER I.
THE TESTIMONY OF GEOGONY, OR THE SCIENCE OF THE ORIGIN OF THE EARTH.
Les lots gen&rales de la g&ogtnie favorisent &amp;lt;fzinefa(on remarquable Fhypothhe dont nous venons d?ebaucher les traits. COUNT SAPORTA.
COULD it once be proven that the Arctic termi nus of the earth has always been the ice-bound re
gion which it now is, and which for thousands of years it has been, it would of course be useless to entertain for a moment the hypothesis that the cra dle of the human race was there located. Prob
ably the popular impression that from the beginning of the world the far North has been the region of unendurable cold has been one of the chief reasons why our hypothesis is so late in claiming attention.
At the present time, however, so far as this difficulty is concerned, scientific studies have abundantly pre
pared the way for the new theory.
That the earth is a slowly cooling body is a doc
trine now all but universally accepted. In saying this we say nothing for or against the so-called neb
ular hypothesis of the origin of the world, for both friends and foes of this unproven hypothesis believe in what is termed the secular cooling or refrigera tion of the earth. All authorities in this field hold and teach that the time was when the slowly solid
ifying planet was too hot to support any form of life, and that only at some particular time in the cooling



$8 PARADISE FOUND.
process was there a temperature reached which was
adapted to the necessities of living things.
On what portion of the earth s surface, now, would this temperature first be reached ? Or would it everywhere be reached at the same time ?
These are most interesting questions, and the writer has often marveled that in scientific treatises on the cooling globe he could nowhere find them
formally discussed. Granting, however, a uniform interior heat and a uniform loss of it in the mode
of superficial radiation in all directions into space, it is certain that if these were the only factors in
the problem the cooling process would affect every part of the surface in a uniform manner, and we
might confidently infer that the temperature com patible with organic life was reached at the same time at all points of the earth s surface. But the factors named are not the only ones of the problem. In those far-off geologic ages the heat received from the great central furnace of our system, the sun, cannot have been less than at the present time. Some astronomers and geologists claim that it was greater. 1 In any case, therefore, as early as the time
when the earth s atmosphere became penetrable by the rays of the sun, local differences of temperature
must have been produced at the base of the atmos
phere, whether the body of the globe was as yet
crusted over or not. Then as now, viewed apart
from air and water currents, every particular spot on the surface of the globe must have had a tempera ture determined, first by the fixed and uniform in
herent heat of the earth-mass, and secondly by the varying quantity of heat received from the sun. But
i See Winchell, World-Life, pp. 484-490.



THE TESTIMONY OF GEOGONY. 59
the difference between the solar heat received at a point under the equator and that received at a point at the pole cannot have been less in those ages than at the present time ; and this incessant increment of the equatorial heat of the earth by the direct rays
of the sun suggests at once the portions of the globe to which we must look if we would find the regions which first became cool enough to sustain organic life. Then as now the polar regions must have been cooler than the equatorial, and hence, as far as
the teachings of theoretical geogony can be trusted, the conclusion is inevitable that there, to wit, in the
polar regions, life first became possible. 1 The bearing of this result upon our central thesis
is at once obvious. We asked the geologist this
question :
&quot; Is the hypothesis of a primeval polar Eden admissible ?
&quot;
Looking at the slowly cooling earth alone, he replies,
&quot; Eden conditions have prob ably at one time or another been found everywhere upon the surface of the earth. Paradise may have
been anywhere.&quot; Looking at the cosmic environ ment, however, he adds, &quot; But while Paradise may
have been anywhere, the first portions of the earth s surface sufficiently cool to present the conditions
of Eden life were assuredly at the Poles.&quot;

CHAPTER II.
THE TESTIMONY OF ASTRONOMICAL GEOGRAPHY.
The nights are never so dark at the Pole as in other regions, for the moon and
stars seem to possess twice as much light and effulgence. In addition, there is a
continuous light in the North, the varied shades and play of which are amongst the strangest phenomena of nature. RAMBOSSON S Astronomy.
The fact which gives the phenomenon of the polar aurora its greatest impor
tance is that the earth becomes self-luminous ; that, besides the light which as a planet it receives from the central body, it shows a capability of sustaining a lu
minous process proper to itself, HUMBOLDT.
WE are apt to think of an unbroken night of six months at the Pole. Eminent scientific authorities
speak as if this conception were correct. Thus Pro
fessor Geikie, in his admirable new manual of Geol ogy, writing of the Arctic flora of the Miocene age,
says, &quot;When we remember that this vegetation
grew luxuriantly within 8 15 of the North Pole, in a region which is in darkness for half of the yeary ... we can realize the difficulty of the problem in the distribution of climate which these facts present
to the geologist.&quot;
*
In like manner Sir Charles Lyell, discussing the
question of the possibility of whales reaching the supposed open sea at the Pole, says,
&quot; They could pass under considerable barriers of ice, provided
there were &quot;openings here and there; and so they may, perhaps, reach a more open sea near the Pole,

and find sustenance there during a day of more than five months1
duration.&quot; 1
From such representations as these the reader
naturally carries away the impression that daylight lasts at the Pole somewhat over five months, while all the rest of the year the region is shrouded in darkness. Were this true, it would certainly be an unpromising region in which to search for the ter restrial Paradise.
Fortunately for our hypothesis, this conception of the duration of the polar night is very far from true. The half-yearly reign of darkness exists only in the uninstructed imagination. Astronomical geography
teaches that, as respects daylight, the polar regions are and always have been the most favored portions
of the globe. As early a popularizer of natural sci ence as the Rev. Thomas Dick set forth the real
facts as follows :
&quot; Under the Poles, where the dark ness of night would continue six months without in termission if there were no refraction, total dark ness does not prevail one half of this period. When the sun sets at the North Pole, about the 2$d of
September, the inhabitants (if any) enjoy a perpet ual aurora till he has descended eighteen degrees below the horizon. In his course through the eclip tic, the sun is two months before he can reach this
point, during which time there is a perpetual twi light. In two months more he arrives again at the
same point, namely, eighteen degrees below the ho rizon, when a new twilight commences, which is
continually increasing in brilliancy for other two months, at the end of which the body of this lumi
nary is seen rising in all its glory. So that in this

region the light of day is enjoyed in a greater or less degree for ten months, without interruption by the effects of atmospheric refraction ; and during the two months when the influence of the solar light
is entirely withdrawn, the moon is shining above the horizon for two half months without intermission ; and thus it happens that no more than two separate
fortnights are passed in total darkness, and this darkness is alleviated by the light of the stars and the frequent coruscations of the Aurora Borealis. Hence it appears that there are no portions of our
globe which enjoy throughout the year so large a portion of the solar light as these northern re

Striking as is this account of the polar day, it is
noteworthy that experience has repeatedly shown that the actual duration of light in high latitudes exceeds even the calculations of the astronomers.
Thus, in the spring of 1873, the officers of the Aus trian expedition, under Lieutenants Weyprecht and Payer, were surprised to behold the sun three days
before the date on which he was expected to rise.
A
late writer thus states the case :
&quot; In the latitude
(79 1 S
! N.) in which the Tegethoff was lying, the sun ought to reappear above the horizon on the iQth
of February ; but, owing to an effect of refraction, due to the low temperature prevailing, 30 R., the explorers were able to salute its rays three days ear
lier.&quot; 2
Lieutenant Payer s own account is as follows : &quot;Though the sun did not return to our latitude (78

15 N., 71 38 E. long.) till the iQth of February, we were able to greet his beams three days previous to that date, owing to the strong refraction of i 40
which accompanied a temperature of 30 R.&quot; 1 Still more remarkable was the experience of Barentz s Arctic expedition, almost three hundred years ago. Dr. Dick alludes to it as follows :
&quot; The re
fractive power of the atmosphere has been found to be much greater, in certain cases, than what has now been stated. In the year 1595 [1596-97] a company of Dutch sailors having been wrecked on the shores of Novaia Zemlia, and having been obliged to remain in that desolate region during a night of more than three months [it was a little less than three months], beheld the sun make his appearance in the horizon about sixteen days before the time in
which he should have risen according to calculation, and when his body was actually more than four de
grees below the horizon.&quot; The only explanation of
this astonishing phenomenon which the same writer
offers is found in this appended clause, &quot; which circumstance has been attributed to the great refrac
tive power of the atmosphere in those intensely cold
regions.&quot; This is so unsatisfactory that not a few
prefer to believe, what seems entirely incredible, namely, that Barentz and his men in the short space of less than three months made a blunder of sixteen days in their time record.
Professor Nordenskjold has recently referred to the case as follows :
&quot; On the J^th November the sun disappeared and was again visible on the 24
31;. These dates have caused scientific men much per

edge of the sun ought to have ceased to be visible
when the sun s south declination in autumn became
greater than I3 ,
1 and to have become visible again
when the declination again became less than that figure ; that is to say, the sun ought to have been seen for the last time at Barentz s Ice Haven on the
5S- October, and it ought to have appeared again
there on the ^ Feb. It has been supposed that the deviation arose from a considerable error in count
ing the days, but this was unanimously denied by
the crew who wintered.&quot; 2 In a foot-note he gives proofs which seem convincing that no such error can have been committed. But while these experiences of Barentz and the Austrians point to a duration of darkness at the Pole of less than sixty days out of the three hundred
and sixty-five, some apparently good authorities ex tend the period to seventy-six or seventy-seven days. Thus Captain Bedford Pirn, of the Royal Navy of Great Britain, makes the following statement :
&quot; On
the 1 6th of March the sun rises, preceded by a long
dawn of forty-seven days, namely, from the 2Qth of January, when the first glimmer of light appears.
On the 25th of September the sun sets, and after a
twilight of forty-eight days, namely, on the I3th of November, darkness reigns supreme, so far as the sun is concerned, for seventy-six days, followed by one long period of light, the sun remaining above
the horizon one hundred and ninety-four days. The year, therefore, is thus divided at the Pole: 194 days
sun ; 76 darkness ; 47 days dawn ; 48 twilight.&quot;

TESTIMONY OF ASTRONOMICAL GEOGRAPHY. 65
Even according to this account we should have at
the Pole only 76 days of darkness to 289 days of light in the year. In other words, instead of being in darkness little short of half of the time, as at the equator, one would be in darkness but about one
fourth of the time. As far as light is concerned, therefore, even on this calculation the polar region is twice as favorable to life as any equatorial region that can be named. But whence this discrepancy among the astrono
mers ? Why should some of them make the polar
night sixteen days longer than others ? The simple answer is that they proceed upon dif ferent assumptions as to atmospheric refraction in the region of the Pole. In our latitude twilight is
usually reckoned to begin when the centre of the rising sun is yet 18 below the horizon. Starting
with this as the limit, and counting sunrise and sun set to be the moments when the sun s upper limb is on the horizon, we arrive at the division of the polar
year given by Captain Pirn. But astronomers say
that in England twilight has been observed when
the sun was 21 below the horizon. To be entirely safe some have therefore taken 20 as the limit of
solar depression, and reckoning with this datum, in stead of the 1 8 before mentioned, have found that
at the Pole the morning twilight would begin Jan
uary 2Oth, and the evening twilight would cease No
vember 2 1 st. This would make the period of dark ness but 60 days, and the period of light 305. Thus a difference of only two degrees in the assumed limit of solar depression at the beginning and end of the twilights makes the difference of sixteen days in the supposed duration of darkness. &quot; Which of

the two calculations,&quot; writes an eminent American mathematician, &quot; is the more correct is known, I im
agine, by no one.&quot; l
To us in the present discussion the discrepancy is
of very little moment. It is only a question as to whether at the Pole there is daylight three fourths
or five sixths of the year. Both suppositions may
be and probably are wrong. For if &quot;in tropical climates 16 or 17 is said to be a sufficient allow ance for the extreme solar depression, while, on the
other hand, it is said in England to vary from 17 to
21,&quot; it certainly looks as though in yet higher lati tudes the light of the sun might be discernible when
its body is as much as 21 or 22 below the horizon; and this would reduce the annual polar darkness to
less than fifty days. This supposition is rendered the more probable by the fact that, while the ex
peditions already alluded to found much more of daylight than their astronomical calculations had led them to expect, we have no offsetting accounts where the sun was awaited in vain. The final and authoritative settlement of the question can be reached only by actual observation. Among the fascinating problems whose solution awaits the
progress of Arctic exploration, we must therefore
place the scientific determination of the unknown duration of the polar day. In view of the foregoing we are certainly safe in
conceiving of the polar night as lasting not over four fortnights. During two of these, as Dick re
minds us, the moon would be walking in beauty

In such a perfect and regular stellar system kept in view so long and so continuously, the irregular movements of the &quot;planets,&quot; or wandering stars, could not possibly escape observation. All their cu
rious accelerations, retardations, conjunctions, decli nations, would be perfectly marked and measured on
the revolving but changeless dial - plate of the re moter sky. Dwelling in such a natural observatory, any people would of necessity become astronomers.1
And how magnificent and orderly would the on goings of the universe appear when viewed from underneath a firmament whose centre of revolution was fixed in the observer s zenith! After long
months of unbroken daylight; how would one s soul yearn for a new vision of those stellar glories of the
night ! Nor would the moon and silent stars be the only attractions of the brief period during which
the light of the sun was withdrawn. The mystic play of the Northern Light would transform the familiar daylight world into a veritable fairy-land.

tempt a description of that surpassing spectacle in which all the splendors and loveliness of sixty of our
dawns are combined in one. No words can ever por
tray it. No poet s imagination, even, has ever given us such unearthly scenery. First of all appears low in the horizon of the night
sky a scarcely visible flush of light. At first it only makes a few stars light seem a trifle fainter, but after a little it is seen to be increasing, and to be
moving laterally along the yet dark horizon. Twen ty-four hours later it has made a complete circuit
around the observer, and is causing a larger number of stars to pale. Soon the widening light glows with the lustre of &quot; Orient pearl.&quot; Onward it moves in
its stately rounds, until the pearly whiteness burns
into ruddy rose-light, fringed with purple and gold. Day after day, as we measure days, this splendid
panorama circles on, and, according as atmospheric conditions and clouds present more or less favorable conditions of reflection, kindles and fades, kindles and fades, fades only to kindle next time yet more brightly, as the still hidden sun comes nearer and
nearer his point of emergence. At length, when for two long months such prophetic displays have been filling the whole heavens with these increscent and
revolving splendors, the sun begins to emerge from his long retirement, and to display himself once
more to human vision. After one or two circuits,
during which his dazzling upper limb grows to a, fullorbed disk, he clears all hill-tops of the distant hori zon, and for six full months circles around and
around the world s great axis in full view, suffering no night to fall upon his favored home-land at the

Pole. Even when at last he sinks again from view he covers his retreat with a repetition of the deepen
ing and fading splendors which filled his long dawn ing, as if in these pulses of more and more distant light he were signaling back to the forsaken world
the promises and prophecies of an early return. In these prosaic sentences we aim at no descrip tion of the indescribable ; we only remind ourselves of the bald facts and conditions which govern the
unpicturable transformations of each year-long polar night and day. Enough, however, has been said for our purpose. Whoever seeks as a probable location for Paradise the heavenliest spot on earth with respect to light
and darkness, and with respect to celestial scenery, must be content to seek it at the Arctic Pole. Here is the true City of the Sun. Here is the one

OUR hypothesis calls for an antediluvian conti

forty years ago advanced the same postulate. 1 Is the supposition that there existed such a continent
scientifically admissible ? Until very recently too little was known of the geology of the high latitudes to warrant or even to occasion the discussion of such a question. Even
now, with all the contemporary interest in Arctic exploration, it is difficult to find any author who has distinctly propounded to himself and discussed the question as to the geologic age of the Arctic Ocean. It will not be strange, therefore, if we have here to
content ourselves with showing, first, that geologists

and paleontologists do not think the present distri bution of Arctic sea and land to be the primeval
one ; and secondly, that in their opinion, incidentally expressed, a &quot; continent &quot; once existed within the
Arctic Circle of which at present only vestiges re main. We will begin with the distinguished Alfred Rus
sel Wallace, who in speaking of the Miocene period presents us with a very different Northern hemi
sphere from ours of to-day. For instance, in his
view Scandinavia was at that time a vast island. He
says :
&quot; The distribution of the Eocene and Miocene formations shows that during a considerable portion of the Tertiary period an inland sea, more or less oc
cupied by an archipelago of islands, extended across Central Europe between the Baltic and the Black and Caspian seas, and thence by narrower channels southeastward to the valley of the Euphrates and the Persian Gulf, thus opening a communication between the North Atlantic and the Indian Ocean. From the Caspian also a wide arm of the sea ex
tended, during some part of the Tertiary epoch, northwards to the Arctic Ocean, and there is noth ing to show that this sea may not have been in
existence during the whole Tertiary period. An other channel probably existed over Egypt into the eastern basin of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea ; while it is probable that there was a communi cation between the Baltic and the White Sea, leav ing Scandinavia as an extensive island. Turning to India, we find that an arm of the sea, of great width and depth, extended from the Bay of Bengal to the mouths of the Indus ; while the enormous depression indicated by the presence of marine fossils of Eo

cene age at a height of 16,500 feet in Western Tibet renders it not improbable that a more direct chan nel across Afghanistan may have opened a commu
nication between the West Asiatic and Polar seas.&quot; 1
Later, in the same book, Mr. Wallace incidentally
shows that the facts of Arctic paleontology call for
the supposition of a primitive Eocene continent in
the highest latitudes, a continent which no longer exists. His language is,
&quot; The rich and varied fauna which inhabited Europe at the dawn of the Terti ary period as shown by the abundant remains of
mammalia wherever suitable deposits of Eocene age
have been discovered proves that an extensive Palearctic continent then existed.&quot; 2
Another most eminent authority in Arctic pale
ontology, the late Professor Heer, of Zurich, fully fifteen years ago arrived at and published the con clusion that the facts presented in the Arctic fossils plainly point to the existence in Miocene time of a no longer existing polar continent. Fuller reference to his views will be made in our next chapter.3
On another and more lithological line of evidence
Baron Nordenskjold, the eminent Arctic explorer, has arrived at the same conclusion. Speaking of certain rock strata north of the 6gth degree of north
latitude, he says,
&quot; An extensive continent occupied this portion of the globe when these strata were de
posited.&quot;
4 Elsewhere he speaks of this &quot; ancient
polar continent &quot; as something already accepted and
universally understood among scientific men. He

also alludes to the conspiring evidences of its for mer existence found in different departments of re
search. &quot; These basalt beds,&quot; he remarks, &quot; prob
ably originated from a volcanic chain, active during
the Tertiary period, which perhaps limits the an
cient polar continent, in the same manner as is now the case with the eastern coast of Asia and the western of America ; this confirming the division of
land and water in the Tertiary period, which upon
totally different grounds has been supposed to have
existed.&quot; 1
Another authority in this field, writing of the theory that continuous land once connected Europe and North America at the North, remarks, &quot; In further support of this theory we have the fact that no trace of sea deposit of Eocene age has ever been
found in the polar area, all the vestiges of strata
remaining showing that these latitudes were then
occupied by dry land.&quot; 2 Finally, as our assumption of the early existence of a circumpolar Arctic continent is thus supported
by most competent geological authority, so is also our hypothesis that its disappearance was due to a submergence beneath the waters of the Arctic
Ocean. On this point what could be more explicit
and satisfactory than the following, from one of the
greatest of living geologists :
&quot; We know very well
that . . . within a comparatively recent geological
period ... a wide stretch of Arctic land, of which Novaia Zemlia and Spitzbergen formed a part, has
been submerged.&quot; 3

TESTIMONY OF PHYSIOGRAPHICAL GEOLOGY. 75
As to the natural conditions and forces which may be conceived as having brought about this continental catastrophe, geologists are not so well
agreed. The French savant, Alfonse-Joseph Adhemar, 1 has advanced a theory that this North-polar
deluge was only one of an alternating series, which in age-long periods recur first at the North and then at the South Pole. Flammarion, writing of it,
says :
&quot; This theory depends on the fact of the un
equal length of the seasons in the two hemispheres. Our autumn and winter last 179 days. In the south
ern hemisphere they last 186 days. This seven days, or 168 hours of difference, increase each year
the coldness of the pole. During 10,500 years the ice accumulates at one pole and melts at the other,
thereby displacing the earth s centre of gravity.
Now a time will arrive when, after the maximum of
elevation of temperature on one side, a catastrophe will happen which will bring back the centre of gravity to the centre of the figure, and cause an im
mense deluge. The deluge of the North Pole was 4,200 years ago ; therefore the next will be 6,300
hence.&quot; 2
Another recent theory teaches that the poles are
periodically deluged, but simultaneously, not in al ternation. The alternative movement is at the equa tor. The crust of the earth at the equator is all the
time rising or sinking in a kind of aeonian rhythm.
historiques et philosophiques sur les Civilisations Europeenne, Romaine, Greque, etc. Paris, 1874: vol. i., pp. 348-352. 1 In his Revolutions de la Mer. 2 ed, 1860. 2 Flammarion naturally adds, &quot; It is very obvious to ask on this, Why should there be a catastrophe, and why should not the centre of
gravity return gradually, as it was gradually displaced ? &quot; Astronomi cal Myths, p. 426. But a gradual displacement would produce a del uge, only a gradual one.



76 PARADISE FOUND.
Whenever it sinks beyond the equilibrium figure, due to its actual rate of rotation, lands emerge at the
poles ; whenever it rises beyond the equilibrium figure, the polar lands sink and are submerged be neath the waters of the ocean. Professor Alexander Winchell thus expounds the view :
&quot; It has been shown that one of the actions of tides upon a plan
etary body tends to diminish its rate of rotation.
Correspondingly, its equatorial protuberance will tend to diminish. In the case of a planet still re
taining its liquid condition, the equatorial subsidence will keep nearly even pace with the retardation.
To whatever extent viscosity exists, the subsidence will follow the retardation. There will exist an ex
cess of protuberance beyond the equilibrium figure due to the actual rotation, and this will act as an additional retardative cause. In the case of an incrusted and somewhat rigid planet, the excess of ellipticity would attain its greatest value. It would continue to augment until the strain upon the mass should become sufficient to lower the excessive pro
tuberance to the equilibrium figure. The recovery of this figure might take place convulsively. The equatorial regions would then subside, and the polar would rise. In the case of an incrusted planet ex
tensively covered, like the earth, by a film of water, retarded rotation would be attended by a prompt subsidence of the equatorial waters and rise of the polar waters to about twice the same extent. In
other words, the equatorial lands would emerge, and
the polar lands would become submerged. The amount of emergence would diminish with increase of distance from the equator, and the amount of submergence would diminish with increase of dis

tance from the pole. In about the latitude of 30 the two tendencies would meet and neutralize each other. Under these conditions, an incrusted and ocean-covered planet, since it must be undergoing a process of rotary retardation, must possess the
deepest oceans about the poles and the shallowest
about the equator. The first emergences of land,
accordingly, will take place within the equatorial zone ; and the highest elevations and greatest land
areas will exist within that zone. The elevation of equatorial land-masses would interpose new obstruc
tions to the equatorial ocean current. This would
divert it in new directions, and thus modify all cli mates within reach of oceanic influences. Changes
of currents would necessitate the migration of ma rine faunas, and changes of climate would modify the faunas and floras of the land.
&quot;But the protrusion of the equatorial land-mass
could not increase indefinitely. The same central force which retains the ocean continually at the equi librium figure strains the solid mass in the same di
rection. The strain must at length become greater than the rigidity of the mass can withstand. The
equatorial land protuberance will subside toward the level of the ocean. Some parts of the ocean s
bottom must correspondingly rise. Naturally, the parts about the poles will rise most. Thus some equatorial lands will become submerged, and some northern and southern areas may become newly
emergent. &quot; But these vertical movements would not be ar
rested precisely at the point of recovery of the equi
librium figure. As suggested by Prof. J. E. Todd,
and less explicitly by Sir Wm. Thomson, the move

ment would pass the equilibrium figure to an extent
proportional to the cumulation of strain. The equa
torial region would become too much depressed, and the polar regions too much elevated. The effect of this would be to accelerate the rotation sufficiently to neutralize the ceaseless tidal retardation. The day would be shortened. The ocean would rise still
higher along the shores of equatorial lands, and sub
side along the shores of polar lands.. An extension
of polar lands would immediately modify the cli mates of the higher latitudes. They would become
subject to greater extremes. A considerable eleva tion of polar lands would diminish the mean tem
perature, and the region of perpetual snow would be enlarged. These effects would visit the northern
and southern hemispheres simultaneously. &quot; Such effects would follow from an excessive sub sidence of equatorial lands. But the constant retardative action of the tides would cause the equa
torial lands again to emerge, and protrude beyond the limits of the equilibrium figure attained in a later age. Thus the former condition would return, and the former events would be repeated. In the nature of force and matter these oscillations should be repeated many times. Professor Todd suggests that the present terrestrial age is one of equatorial land subsidence and of high latitude emergence.
Immediately preceding the present, the Champlain epoch was one of northern and probably of south polar subsidence ; while further back, in the Glacial
epoch, we have evidence of northern, and perhaps also south latitude elevation.&quot; l

Leibnitz, Deluc, and others, have presented a still different view of the etiology of all deluges, accord ing to which they are the result of a steady shrink age of the earth in consequence of its secular cool ing. According to this theory, after once a solid earth -crust had been formed, the cooling nucleus within it withdrew the support on which the crust
had rested, in proportion as it shrank away from be neath it, until, as often as the subterranean voids thus created became too great for the strength of the
crust, this of necessity fell in with the force of in
computable tons, carrying the ruined surface to such a depth as to cause it immediately ta be overflowed
and submerged by the adjacent water| of the ocean. The geologic history of the earth is divided into its strongly marked periods by these successive
&quot;
collapsions
&quot; of the rocky strata which constituted
the primitive crust. &quot; Each succeeding cataclysm,&quot; says a recent advocate of the view, &quot; considered as a
universal catastrophe, must leave the globe a wreck, like the ruin of some immense cathedral whose dome and arches have fallen in. Cornice and frieze, pillar
and entablature, broken and dislocated, lie at all an gles of inclination and in the utmost confusion. So it is with the ancient rocks and more modern strata. Only to this mighty wreck have been added the out
gushings of molten matter into fissures, creating dikes, and the unsparing movements of oceans sweeping loose materials and perishing forms of all
sorts from one place to another, partially covering up and disguising the desolation.&quot;
Again, the same writer says :
&quot; The present sun face of the earth is comparatively recent. The last
great cataclysm is, geologically speaking, not very

ancient. Accumulating evidence compels us to be lieve that one of those destructive events has oc curred since the human race was created. The facts I have presented plainly indicate that another is in
the course of preparation. Each of these vast peri odical voids between the nucleus and the crust is
filled by collapsion of the surface. . . . Thus, if we
assume that the globe was one hundred or three
hundred miles greater in all its diameters when its crust became hard and was bathed with the earliest seas, and when marine plants and trilobites and mol
lusca began to appear, the lithological characteris tics of the paleozoic ages will be more acceptably
deciphered. So successively with the carboniferous periods, whose vast areas have been folded up and

Although starting with no such purpose, the au thor, in expounding this general Leibnitzian theory
of all deluges, incidentally explains the submersion of the primeval Arctic continent. In accordance with his theory, he asserts that &quot; the diameter of the earth at the poles must have been at some more an cient epoch very much greater than now. It must have been more than twenty-seven miles greater to
permit such equatorial or tropical exposures to the

sun as we know to be necessary for the production of those vegetable forms which abound in the coal measures of Arctic latitudes. 1 If it was fifty or a
hundred miles greater during any portion of the carboniferous age, it might have been two hundred during the Taconic period, and perhaps three hun dred or more when the life-force began to fashion its
primordial and rudimentary organisms upon its wait
ing surface.&quot; He furthermore distinctly asserts that
Sir Isaac Newton s supposed demonstration that the oblateness of the earth s figure is due to the centrif
ugal force generated by its rotation &quot; is an error un
worthy of further consideration among geologists.&quot;
The true explanation, as he regards it, is stated as follows :
&quot; The shorter axes of the globe what at present are our poles are not the result of flatten
ing by rotation, but by a sudden falling in of sur
face.&quot; 2
Here, of course, is just that down-sinking of wide polar regions, in &quot; comparatively recent &quot;
geologic time, demanded by the facts of Arctic geology. It must have been greater than any of those which have occurred in other portions of the globe, for it
has permanently modified the originally and natu rally spherical figure of the earth. The author is &quot; compelled to believe &quot; that it, or one like it,
&quot; oc
curred since the human race was created.&quot; More
over, this belief is in no wise built upon the Biblical record of the Deluge, for he speaks almost bitterly
of &quot; the retarding influence of Jewish legends upon
the free expansion of the human intellect,&quot; and

knowledge.&quot; Happily for Moses, the second in this portentous duumvirate is no worse a man than Sir Isaac Newton ! It is by no means necessary to commit ourselves to any one of these theories of deluges, or to seek
still other explanations of the recognized subsidence of the basin now occupied by the Arctic Ocean. Enough for the present that upon the authority of eminent physiographic geologists we have shown : 1. That the present distribution of land and water
within the Arctic Circle is, geologically speaking, of
very recent origin. 2. That the paleozoic data of the highest explored latitudes demand for their explanation the hypothe sis of an extensive circumpolar continent in Mio cene time. 3. That lithological authorities affirm that such a continent existed. 4. That physical geography has reached the con clusion that the known islands of the Arctic Ocean, such as Novaia Zemlia and the Spitzbergen, are
simply mountain tops still remaining above the sur
face of the sea which has come in and covered up
the primeval continent to which they belonged.
5. And finally, that the problem of the process by which this grand catastrophe was brought about is now sporadically engaging the thoughts of terres
trial physicists and geologists. 1

CHAPTER IV.
THE TESTIMONY OF PREHISTORIC CLIMATOLOGY.
Ver illud erat, ver magnus agebat Orbis. VERGIL.
One of the most startling and important of the scientific discoveries of the last
twenty years has been that of the relics of a luxuriant Miocene flora in various
farts of the Arctic regions. It is a discovery which was totally unexpected, and
is even now considered by many men of science to be completely unintelligible, but
it is so thoroughly established, and it has such an important bearing on the subjects
we are discussing in the present volume , that it is necessary to lay a tolerably com
plete outline of the facts before our readers. A. R. WALLACE (1880).
THUS far, then, we have found theoretical geogony demanding a location at the Pole for the first
country presenting conditions of Eden life ; we have found the requisite astronomical conditions to give it an abundance of light ; we have found the geolo gists attesting the former existence of such a coun try ; we must now interrogate Prehistoric Climatol ogy, and ascertain whether this lost land ever enjoyed
a temperature which admits of the supposition that here was the primitive abode of man. The answer to our question comes, not from one, but from sev eral sources. 1
1 We have no use here for mere fancy sketches, like the following, which appeared on the loth of May, 1884, in The Norwood Review
and Crystal Palace Reporter (Eng.), and which looks very much like an unacknowledged loan from Captain Hall, of Arctic fame :
&quot; We
do not admit that there is ice up to the Pole. No one has been nearer that point than 464 miles. Once inside the great ice-barrier, a new world breaks upon the explorer ; a climate first mild like that of England, and afterwards balmy as that of the Greek Isles, awaits
the hardy adventurer who first beholds those wonderful shores. Won derful, indeed ; for he will be greeted by a branch of the human race



84 PARADISE FOUND.
First, geogony gives us an almost irresistible an tecedent probability. For if the earth from its ear liest consolidation has been steadily cooling, it is hardly possible to conceive of a method by which
any region once too hot for human residence can
have become at length too cold except by passing through all the intermediate stages of temperature, some of which must have been precisely adapted to
human comfort.
Again, paleontological botany shows that in Eu
rope in Tertiary times this hypothetical cooling of the earth was going on, and going on in the steady
and regular way postulated by theoretic geogony. 1 But if a telluric process as essentially universal as
this was going on in Europe, there is no reason why it should not have been going on in all countries, whether to the north, or to the south, or to the east, or to the west of Europe.
But we are not left to inferences of this sort. It is now admitted by all scientific authorities that at one time the regions within the Arctic Circle en
joyed a tropical or nearly tropical climate. Profes
cut off from the rest of humanity by that change of climate which came over Northern Europe about 2,000 years ago, but surrounded by a profusion of life bewildering in the extreme.&quot; Speculations or fancies of this sort have ever clustered about this mysterious region of the Pole. As we shall hereafter see, they
abounded in remote antiquity. Even the singular fancy known to the public as &quot; Symmes Hole &quot; antedates Symmes, and may be found in
much more attractive form in Klopstock s Messiah. (K. s Sammtliche
Werke. Leipsic, 1854: vol. i., pp. 24, 25.) 1

sor Nicholson uses the following language :
&quot; In the
early Tertiary period the climate of the northern hemisphere, as shown by the Eocene animals and
plants, was very much hotter than it is at present ;
partaking, indeed, of a sub-tropical character. In the
Middle Tertiary or Miocene period the temperature, though not high, was still much warmer than that
now enjoyed by the northern hemisphere ; and we
know that the plants of the temperate regions at that time flourished within the Arctic Circle.&quot; l
Mr. Grant Allen says, &quot;One thing at least is
certain, that till a very recent period, geologically
speaking, our earth enjoyed a warm and genial cli
mate up to the actual poles themselves, and that
all its vegetation was everywhere evergreen, of
much the same type as that which now prevails in
the modern tropics.&quot;

Alluding to those distant ages, M. le Marquis de Nadaillac remarks :
&quot; Under these conditions, life
spread freely even to the Pole.&quot; 3 Similar is the
language of Croll :
&quot; The Arctic regions, probably up to the North Pole, were not only free from ice, but were covered with a rich and luxuriant vegeta tion.&quot; 4 Keerl holds that at the very Pole it was then warmer than now at the equator.5 Professor Oswald Heer s calculations would possibly modify
Keerl s estimate to a slight degree, but only enough to make the circumpolar climate of that far-off age a

little more Edenic than is that of the hottest por
tions of our present earth. 1 Sir Charles Lyell, who in the discussion of this
subject is characteristically cautious and &quot;uniformi
tarian,&quot; does not hesitate to say,
&quot; The result, then,
of our examination, in this and in the preceding chapter, of the organic and inorganic evidence as to the state of the climate of former geological periods is in favor of the opinion that the heat was generally in excess of what it now is. In the greater part of the Miocene and preceding Eocene epochs the fauna and flora of Central Europe were sub-tropical, and a vegetation resembling that now seen in Northern Europe extended into the Arctic regions as far as
they have yet been explored, and probably reached the Pole itself. In the Mesozoic ages the predomi nance of reptile life and the general character of the fossil types of that great class of vertebrata indicate
a warm climate and an absence of frost between the
4Oth parallel of latitude and the Pole, a large ichthy osaurus having been found in lat. 77 16 N.&quot; 2 Averaging the above views and estimates of sci entific authorities, we have at the Pole, in the age of
the first appearance of the human race, a tempera
ture the most equable and delightful possible ; and
with this we may well be content.

THE TESTIMONY OF PALEONTOLOGICAL BOTANY.
S) von dort aus d. h. aus diesem Bildungsherd fur die Pflanzen siid

It is now an established conclusion that the great aggressive faunas and floras
of the continents have originated in the North, some of them within the A relic
Circle. PRINCIPAL DAWSON (1883).
ALL traditions of the primeval Paradise require us
to conceive of it as possessed of a tropical flora of the most beautiful and luxuriant sort, as adorned
with &quot; every tree that is pleasant to the sight, or
good for food.&quot; Any theory, therefore, as to the site
of Eden must of necessity present a locality where
this condition could have been met. How is it with the hypothesis now under consideration ?
To reply that a polar Eden is scientifically admis sible in this respect would be to state but a small
part of the truth. So much might unhesitatingly be affirmed in view of the facts presented in the last
chapter. Given in any country on the face of the
globe a long-continued tropical climate, and a tropi cal vegetation may well be expected. Anything else would be so abnormal as to require explanation.
But the study of Paleontological Botany has just
conducted to a new and entirely unanticipated re
sult. The best authorities in this science, both in Europe and America, have lately reached the conclu sion that all thefloral types andforms revealed in the



88 PARADISE FOUND.
oldest fossils of the earth originated in the region of the North Pole, and thence spread first over the north ern and then over the southern hemisphere, proceeding from North to South. This is a conception of the
origin and development of the vegetable world which but a few years ago no scientific man had dreamed of, and which, to many intelligent readers of these
pages, will be entirely new. Its profound interest, as related to the present discussion, will at once be seen.
Without attempting a chronological history of this remarkable discovery, or in any wise assuming to as sign to each pioneer student his share of the credit, we may say that Professor Asa Gray, of America,
Professor Oswald Heer, of Switzerland, Sir Joseph Hooker, of England, Otto Kuntze, of Germany, and Count G. de Saporta, of France, have all been more or less prominently associated with the establish
ment of the new doctrine. Sir Joseph Hooker s studies of the floral types of Tasmania furnished data, before lacking, for a general trans-latitudinal
survey of the whole field. He was struck by the fact
that in that far-off Southern world &quot;the Scandinavian
type asserts his prerogative of ubiquity.&quot; Though at that time he seems not to have divined its sig
nificance, he clearly saw the paleontological and other vestiges of the great movement by which the
far North has slowly clothed the north-temperate, the equatorial, and the southern regions with ver dure. In one passage he describes the impression
made upon him by the facts in the following graphic language :
&quot; When I take a comprehensive view of
the vegetation of the Old World, I am struck with
the appearance it presents of there having been a



TESTIMONY OF PALEONTOLOGICAL BOTANY. 89
continuous current of vegetation, if I may so fan
cifully express myself, from Scandinavia to Tasma
nia.&quot; J
Light on this problem of the far South was soon to come from the far North. In 1868 Profes
sor Oswald Heer, of Zurich, published his truly epoch-making work on the fossil flora of the Arctic
regions, in which he modestly yet with much con fidence advanced the idea that the Bildungsherd, or
mother-region, of all the floral types of the more
southern latitudes was originally in &quot; a great con tinuous Miocene continent within the Arctic Cn% cle,&quot; and that from this centre the southward spread or dispersion of these types had been in a radial or out-raying manner.2 His demonstration of the ex
istence in Miocene times of a warm climate and of
a rich tropical vegetation in the highest attainable Arctic latitudes was complete and overwhelming. Our latest geologists are still accustomed to speak of his result as &quot; one of the most remarkable geo
logical discoveries of modern times.&quot; 3 His theory
of a primeval circumpolar mother-region whence all
floral types proceeded is also at present so little
questioned that to-day among representative schol ars in this field the absorbing and only question
seems to be, Who first proposed and to whom be longs the chief honor of the verification of so broad
and beautiful a generalization ? 4

Here, then, is a new and wonderful light just thrown upon the problem of the site of Eden. The
ology in some of its representatives had anticipated the geologists in teaching that the earth s vestment
of vegetation originally proceeded from one primeval centre, but it is the glory of paleontology to have located that centre and to have given us an evidence
scientifically valid. Wherever man originated, the biologist and botanist now know where was the cra dle of some of the world s tenants. Whatever the direction of the first human migrations, we are now clear as to the direction of that &quot;
great invasion of
{Memoirs of the American Academy of Science, 1857, vol. vi., pp. 377
458), Professor Asa Gray suggested the possibility of the common origination in high northern latitudes of various related species now widely separated in different portions of the north-temperate zone. In 1872, four years after the publication of Heer s work, in treating of &quot; The Sequoia and its History,&quot; in an address (see Joiirnal of the
Am. Ass. for the Advancement of Science, 1872), he renewed in a clearer and stronger manner his advocacy of the idea. In the same
year, and also in 1876, Count Saporta, with due acknowledgment of the work of Professor Heer, gave currency to the theory in the scien tific circles of France. Alluding to this, the Count has recently writ
ten,
&quot; Asa Gray was not the only botanist who had the idea of ex
plaining the presence of disjoined species and genera dispersed across the boreal temperate zone and the two continents, by means of
emigrations from the pole as the mother-region whence these vege table races had radiated in one or several directions. This had been parallelement conceived and developed in France upon the occasion
of the remarkable works of Professor O. Heer.&quot; Am. Journal of
Science, May, 1883, p. 394. The annotation appended to this by Pro fessor Gray may be seen on the same page. For a German acknowl
edgment see Engler, Entwickelungsgeschichte der Pflanzenwelt, Th. i., S. 23 ; for an English, see Nature, London, 1881, p. 446 ; for an
American, J. W. Dawson, &quot; The Genesis and Migration of Plants,&quot; in The Princeton Review, 1879, p. 277. But Dr. Dawson, referring to Saporta s Ancienne Vegetation Polaire, Hooker s Presidential Address of 1878, Thistleton Dyer s Lecture on Plant Distribution, and J. Starkie Gardner s Letters in Nature, 1878, well remarks that &quot;the basis of most of these brochures is to be found in Heer s Flora Fos

Arctic plants and animals which in the beginning
of Quaternary ages came southward into Europe.&quot;

But it may be that the testimony of Paleontologi
cal Botany is not yet exhausted. What if it should
at length appear that along with the plants prehis
toric men and civilized men at that must have
descended from the mother-region of plants to the place where history finds them ? Without any refer
ence to or apparent recognition of the great anthro pological interest of such a question, at least one botanist of Germany, reasoning from botanical facts
and postulates alone, has reached precisely this con clusion. This savant is Professor Otto Kuntze, who has made special studies of the cultivated tropical plants. What other botanists had found true of the wild flora in continents separated by wide oceans he finds true of domesticated plants. But the problem of the spread of these plants from continent to con
1 Geikie, Textbook of Geology, p. 874. Compare Wallace :
&quot; We
have now only to notice the singular want of reciprocity in the migra tions of northern and southern types of vegetation. In return for the vast number of European plants which have reached Australia, not one single Australian plant has entered any part of the north temper ate zone, and the same may be said of the typical southern vegeta
tion in general, whether developed in the Antarctic lands, New Zea
land, South America, or South Africa.&quot; Island-Life. London, 1880 : p. 486. In like manner Sir Joseph Hooker affirms :
&quot;
Geographically speaking, there is no Antarctic flora except a few lichens and sea
weeds.&quot; Nature, 1881: p. 447. Possibly, however, the progress of research may bring to light evidences of a second and less powerful
polar Bildiingsherd of primitive flora forms in the Antarctic region. Some of the discoveries of F. P. Moreno look in that direction. See

tinent raises peculiar and most interesting questions. Taking the banana-plantain, which was cultivated in America before the arrival of Europeans in 1492, Professor Kuntze asks, &quot; In what way was this plant,
which cannot stand a voyage through the temperate zone, carried to America ?
&quot; The difficulty is that
the banana is seedless, and can be propagated in a
new country only by carrying thither a living root and planting it in a suitable soil. Its very seedlessness is evidence of the enormous length of time that it has been cared for by man. As the Professor
says, &quot;A cultivated plant which does not possess
seeds must have been under culture for a very long
period, we have not in Europe a single exclusively seedless, berry-bearing cultivated plant, and hence it is perhaps fair to infer that these plants were cul
tivated as early as the middle of the diluvial period.&quot; But now as to its transportation from the Old World to the New, or vice versa. &quot; It must be remem
bered,&quot; he says, &quot;that the plantain is a tree-like,
herbaceous plant, possessing no easily transportable bulbs, like the potato or the dahlia, nor propagable by cuttings, like the willow or the poplar. It has
only a perennial root, which, once planted, needs hardly any care.&quot; After discussing the subject in all aspects, he reaches the twofold conclusion, first, that civilized man must have brought the roots of the plant into any new regions into which it has
ever come ; and secondly, that its appearance in America can only be accounted for on the supposi tion that it was carried thither by way of the north
polar countries at a time when a tropical climate prevailed at the North Pole. 1

CHAPTER VI.
THE TESTIMONY OF PALEONTOLOGICAL ZOOLOGY.
All the evidence at our command points to the Northern hemisphere as the
birth-place of the class, Mammalia^ and probably of all the orders. ALFRED RUSSEL WALLACE.
C est a des emigrations venues, sinon du pole, du mains des contrees attenantes au cercle polaire, qu il faut attribuer la presence constatee dans les deux
mondes de beaucoup d animaux propres a Phemisphere boreal. COUNT SAPORTA.
BUT in settling the site of Eden the animal king
dom must also have a voice. According to the
Hebrew story, the representatives of this kingdom were an earlier creation than Adam, and in Eden
was the world-fest of their christening. Evidently the lost cradle of humanity must be fixed in time
posterior to the beginnings of animal life, and in space so located that from that spot as a centre all
the multitudinous species, and genera, and orders, and families of the whole animal creation might have radiated forth to the various habitats in which
they are respectively found.
Now it is one of the striking facts connected with
Zoology that if we pass around the globe on any iso thermal line, at the equator, or in any latitude south of it, or in any latitude north of it, until
we come to the confines of the Arctic zone, we find, as we pass from land to land, that the animals we
encounter are specifically unlike. Everywhere we find, along with like climatic and telluric conditions, different animals. The moment, however, we reach



94 PARADISE FOUND.
the Arctic zone, and there make the circuit of the globe, we are everywhere surrounded by the same
species. On the other hand, if we take great circles of the earth s longitude, and pass from the Arctic region
down along the continental masses of the New World to the South Pole, thence returning up a meridian which crosses Africa and Europe, or Aus tralia and Asia, we shall find in the descent abun dant fossil evidence that we are moving forward on
the pathway along which the prehistoric migrations of the animal world proceeded ; while on our return on the other side of the planet we shall find that we are no longer following in the track of ancient mi grations, but are advancing counter to their obvious movement. All this is as true of the flora of the
world as it is of the fauna. Hence the language of the late Professor Orton :
&quot; Only around the shores of the Arctic Sea are the same animals and plants
found through every meridian, and in passing southward along the three principal lines of land
specific identities give way to mere identity of gen era ; these are replaced by family resemblances, and at last even the families become in a measure dis
tinct, not only on the great continents, but also on the islands, till every little rock in the ocean has its
peculiar inhabitants.&quot; l
Another well-known naturalist says :
&quot; It should
also be observed that in the beginning of things the continents were built up from North to South, such has been, at least, the history of the North and South American and the Europeo-Asiatic and the African continents ; and thus it would appear that north of

the equator, at least, animals slowly migrated south ward, keeping pace as it were with the growth and southward extension of the grand land-masses which appeared above the sea in the Paleozoic ages. Hence, scanty as is the Arctic and Temperate region
of the earth at the present time, in former ages
these regions were as prolific in life as the tropics
now are, the latter regions, now so vast, having through all the Tertiary and Quaternary ages been
undisturbed by great geological revolutions, and
meanwhile been colonized by emigrants driven down
by the incoming cold of the glacial period.&quot;
1
As long ago as 1876 Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace
wrote, &quot; All the chief types of animal life appear
to have originated in the great north temperate or northern continents, while the southern continents have been more or less completely isolated during long periods, both from the northern continent and
from each other.&quot; 2 And again, speaking of mam
malia, he said, &quot;All the evidence at our command points to the Northern Hemisphere as the birth
place of the class, and probably of all the orders.&quot; 3
From all the facts but one conclusion is possible, and that is that like as the Arctic Pole is the mother
region of all plants, so it is the mother-region of all animals, the region where, in the beginning, God created every beast of the earth after his kind, and
1 A. S. Packard, Zoology. New York, 2d ed., 1880 : p. 665. In his

cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth
on the earth after his kind. And this is the con clusion now being reached and announced by all
comparative zoologists who busy themselves with the problem of the origin and prehistoric distribu tion of the animal world. But to believe that Pro fessor Heer s &quot; Miocene Arctic Continent &quot; was the cradle of all floral types and the cradle of all faunal forms, and yet deny that it was also the cradle of
the human race, is what few philosophical minds are
likely long to do.

MAN is the one traveler who has certainly been in
the cradle of the human race. He has come from the land we are seeking. Could we but follow back
the trail of his journeyings it would assuredly take us to the garden of pleasantness from which we are exiled. Unfortunately the traveler has lost whole volumes of his itinerary, and what remains is in
many of its passages not easy of decipherment.
What says anthropologic and ethnic Paleontology or what some French writers are beginning to
call Paleoethnique Science respecting the hypoth
esis of a Polar Eden ? At the time when the present writer began his
university lectures on this subject the teachings of professed anthropologists were in the chaotic and contradictory condition indicated in Part First. One of the strongest proofs he could then find that a new light was about to dawn on this field was in the there cited work of Quatrefages, entitled &quot;The 7



98 PARADISE FOUND.
Human Species.&quot;
l Accordingly, in discussing the probable verdict of this science upon the admissi
bility of the new theory of human distribution, the
lecturer presented the following paragraph, and there rested the case :
&quot; Anthropology as represented by Quatrefages seems to be actually feeling its way to the same hy
pothesis. This writer first argues that in the pres ent state of knowledge we should be led to place the cradle of the race in the great region bounded on the south and southwest by the Himalayas, on the west by the Bolor mountains, on the northwest by the Ala-Tau, on the north by the Altai range and
its offshoots, and on the east by the Kingkhan, on the south and southeast by the Felina and Kwen-lun.
Later on, however, he says that paleontological stud ies have very recently led to results which are ca
pable of modifying these primary conclusions. And
after briefly stating these results, he starts the ques tion whether or no the first centre of human appear ance may not have been considerably to the north
of the region just mentioned, even in polar Asia! Without deciding, he adds, Perhaps prehistoric archeology or paleontology will some day confirm or confute this conjecture.
&quot;
The cautious anticipation here expressed was quickly fulfilled. At the concluding lecture of the
same first course it was possible to present the fol lowing as the ripe conclusion of a fellow country
man of Quatrefages, one of the foremost savants of

Europe, Count Saporta : l &quot; We are inclined to re
move to the circumpolar regions of the North the
probable cradle of primitive humanity. From there only could it have radiated as from a centre to spread into the several continents at once, and to give rise to successive emigrations toward the South.
This theory best agrees ivith the presumed march of
the human races.&quot; 2
1 The following note appeared in the Boston Daily Advertiser of
May 25, 1883: THE CRADLE OF THE RACE.
A few years ago, about the time of the appearance of the first edi tion of Dr. WincheU s Preadamites, in a letter addressed to its learned author, I expressed my belief that the Garden of Eden, the
first abode of man, was to be sought in a now submerged country, sit uate at the North Pole. More than a year ago, in a printed essay on Ancient Cosmology, I made the statement that &quot; all ethnic tra ditions point us thither for the cradle of the race.&quot; Early last Jan uary I began a course of lectures in the post-graduate department of the university, setting forth my view and the astonishing mass of cosmological, historic, mythologic, paleontologic, paleoethnic, and other evidences which conspire to its support. Last Monday after noon, about twenty minutes before I was to give the concluding lecture of the course, I opened the fresh-cut leaves of the Revtte des Deux Mondes, the number for the first of this month. In it my eye quickly fell
upon Un Essai de Synthese Paleoethnique, in which M. le Marquis G. de Saporta sums up and sets forth the latest results of paleontological

a closely related doctrine which he holds in common with our Pro fessor Gray, and with Switzerland s Professor Heer (see American

IOO PARADISE FOUND.
In the foregoing we have more than a demonstra
tion of the bare admissibility of our hypothesis. We have in it the latest word of anthropological science
respecting the birth-place of the human race. To make it a complete confirmation of our theory, so far as this field of knowledge is concerned, but one
thing is lacking, and that is a clearer recognition of the great natural revolution or catastrophe which
destroyed man s primitive home and occasioned the
world-wide post-diluvian dispersion. This lack, however, is abundantly supplied by the foremost Ger
man ethnographers, and even by such as represent the most radical Darwinian views. Thus Professor
Friedrich M tiller, of Vienna, and Dr. Moritz Wagner,
both of whom place the probable cradle of the race in some high latitude in Europe or Asia, lay the ut most stress upon the mighty climatic revolution
which came in with the glacial age, ascribing to it
the most stupendous and transforming influences that have ever affected mankind. 1 In our view the deterioration of natural environment reduced the

CHAPTER VIII.
CONCLUSION OF PART THIRD.
We must now be prepared to admit that God can plant an Eden even in Spitzbergen ; that the present state of the -world is by no means the best possible in re
lation to climate and vegetation ; that there have been and might be again condi tions -which could convert the ice-clad Arctic regions into blooming Paradises.
PRINCIPAL J. W. DAWSON.
WE are at the end of the first series of tests, and with what results ?
1. Scientific Cosmology, searching for the place where the physical conditions of Eden-life first ap
peared on our globe, is brought to the very spot
where we have located the cradle of our race.
2. Contrary to all ordinary impressions, we have found this same spot the most favored on the globe,
not only as respects the glories of night, but also in respect to prevalence of daylight. 3. In its geology we have found scientific evidence of the vast cataclysm which destroyed the antedilu vian world and permanently transferred to lower latitudes the habitat of humanity.
4. We have found scientifically accepted evidence that at the time of the advent of man the climate at the Arctic Pole was all that the most poetic leg
ends of Eden could demand.
5. From Paleontological Botany we have learned that this locality was the cradle of the floral lifeforms of the whole known earth.
6. By Paleontological Zoology we have been as

sured that here too originated, and from this centre
eradiated, the fauna of the prehistoric world.
7. And lastly, we have found the latest ethnog
raphers and anthropologists slowly but surely grav itating toward the same Arctic Eden as the only centre from which the migrations of the human race
can be intelligibly interpreted.
We asked of these sciences simply,
&quot; Is our hy pothesis admissible ?
&quot; Their answer is more than an
affirmative ; it is an unanticipated and pronounced confirmation.
Some months after the foregoing chapters had been written and delivered in lectures before classes
of students in the University, a very interesting re inforcement of the views therein advanced appeared
in a little work by Mr. G. Hilton Scribner, of New York, entitled Where did Life Begin ?
&quot; l As Mr.
Scribner was conducted to a belief in the north polar origin of all races of living creatures by considera
tions quite independent of those mythological and historical ones which first led the present writer to the same opinion, the reader of these pages will find in the following extracts a special incentive to pro cure and read the entire treatise from which they are taken. That two minds starting with such en tirely different data should have reached so nearly simultaneously one and the same conclusion touch
ing so difficult and many-sided a problem is surely
not without significance.

PARADISE FOUND.
Our first extract is from pp. 21-23, where the fol
lowing summary of previous reasonings and conclu
sions is given :
&quot; We may therefore safely conclude, if the code of natural laws has been uniformly in
force, First, That life commenced on those parts of
the earth which were first prepared to maintain it ; at any rate, that it never could have commenced
elsewhere. &quot; Second, As the whole earth was at one time
too hot to maintain life, so those parts were prob ably first prepared to maintain it which cooled first.
&quot;Third, That those parts which received the least heat from the sun, and which radiated heat
most rapidly into space, in proportion to mass, and had the thinnest mass to cool, cooled first. &quot; Fourth, That those parts of the earth s sur face, and those only, answering to these conditions are the Arctic and Antarctic zones. &quot; Fifth, That as these zones were at one time too hot, and certain parts thereof are now too cold, for such life as inhabits the warmer parts of the earth, these now colder parts, in passing from the extreme of heat to the extreme of cold, must have
passed slowly through temperatures exactly suited
to all plants and all animals in severalty which now live or ever lived on the earth. &quot; Sixth, If the concurrent conditions which
have usually followed lowering temperature followed
the climatic changes in this case, life did commence on the earth within one or both of certain zones sur
rounding the poles, and sufficiently removed there from to receive the least amount of sunlight neces
sary for vegetal and animal life.



CONCLUSION OF PART THIRD. 105
&quot; It seems almost superfluous to say that those parts of the earth which first became cool enough to maintain life had a climate warmer at that time than that which we now call torrid. It was for an
epoch, and probably a very long one, as hot as it could be and maintain life.
&quot; It is also quite obvious, in the light of the fore
going considerations, that as the temperate zones have always received more heat from the sun, and have had more mass per square foot to cool, in pro
portion to radiating surface, than the polar zones, so, on the other hand, they have always received less heat from the sun and have had less mass to
cool, in proportion to radiating surface, than the torrid zone ; and so when the arctic zones cooled
from a tropical to what we now call a temperate cli mate, the temperate zones had cooled down to that
temperature which we now call a torrid climate,
while the equatorial belt was still too hot for any
form of life. Thus the lowering of temperature, climatic change, and that life which made its advent
in these zones surrounding the poles have crept thence slowly along, pari passu, from these polar
regions to the equator.&quot;
Farther on (pp. 26, 27) he claims that the progres
sive cooling of the region at the Pole is all-sufficient, as a natural cause, to account for that dispersion of
life, vegetable and animal, which proceeded from the Arctic centre southward :
&quot; As might be readily sup posed, these Arctic regions which first became cool enough to maintain life would from the same causes be the first to become too cold for the same pur
pose. And this cold would occur first as a temper ate climate near and around the pole ; at any rate,



106 PARADISE FOUND.
in the centre of a zone just sufficiently removed from the pole to combine the influence of the sun
with its own cooling temperature, so as to become the first fit habitation of life.
&quot; This central cold creating a temperate climate would thus have become the first and all-sufficient cause of a dispersion and distribution of both the tropical plants and animals over another zone next south, next further removed from the pole, and next
sufficiently cool to maintain such life. Moreover, this cooler climate occurring in the centre would have driven out and dispersed such life equally, in
all possible directions. So, if the first habitable zone included the northernmost land of all the great con tinents which converge around the North Pole, this dispersion from an increasing cold to the north of each of them would have sent southward plants and
animals from a common origin and ancestry, to peo ple and to plant all the continents of the earth, with
the possible exception of Australia, whose flora and
fauna are certainly anomalous and possibly indige
nous.&quot;
In section fourth (pp. 28-34) the author briefly touches upon some of the surface features of the
globe peculiarly favorable to the southward migra
tion of plants and animals :
&quot; Let us now see how
admirably the earth is adapted, by its surface forma
tion and topography, for a southern migration from a zone surrounding the North Pole. In the first place, nearly the whole of the earth s surface (and
all the northern hemisphere) is corrugated north and south with alternate continents and deep sea chan nels almost from pole to pole. Both the eastern and western continents extend with unbroken land con



CONCLUSION OF PART THIRD.
nections from the Arctic zone through the northern
temperate, the torrid, and through the southern temperate, almost to the Antarctic zone. Between these great continents lie the deep oceans, whose channels run north and south through as many de
grees of latitude. The great air and ocean currents run north or south ; all the mountain ranges of the western continent and many of the eastern conti nents run mainly north and south. Nearly all the great rivers of the northern hemisphere run north or south. To a southern migration in other
words, a migration from the Arctic region toward the equator these peculiarities of topography, these great corrugations and mountain ranges, these chan nels and currents, are roads and vehicles, guides and helps ; while to an east and west migration the same features are not only obstacles and hindrances, but in the main barriers insuperable.
&quot; The impassability of mountain ranges for most plants is shown by the fact that strongly marked varieties in great numbers and many distinct spe cies occur upon the eastern slopes of the Rocky
Mountains, the Sierra Nevadas, the Alleghanies, and even lower ranges, which are not found at all upon their western sides, and vice versa. Such a condi
tion of things, incompatible as it is with an eastern
and western migration, is quite consistent, however, with a north and south movement. For all the cli
matic conditions, especially that of rainfall, are so different on the opposite sides of all long mountain
ranges that the same variety, split and separated by the northern extremities of these ranges, would, in moving southward along their eastern and western
sides, and encountering such diverse conditions,



108 PARADISE FOUND.
have become in the course of time, under the laws
of adaptation, distinct varieties, and probably differ
ent species. &quot; It may be well now to examine some of the
conditions assisting this movement. Hot air being lighter than cold, the heated air of the northern
equatorial belt has always risen and passed mainly toward the North Pole in an upper current, while the cooler and heavier currents from the north have
swept southward, hugging the surface of the conti nents, laded with pollen, minute germs and spores, and all the winged seeds of plants, bending grass and shrubs and trees constantly to the southward,
and so, by small yearly increments, moving the whole vegetal kingdom through valleys and along the sides of mountain ranges, down the great continents, al ways moving with, and never across, these great sur
face corrugations. It is unnecessary to add that all insects and herbivorous animals would follow the plants, or that the birds and carnivorous animals would follow the herbivorous animals and the in sects. So, too, the currents of the ocean have been established in obedience to similar laws : as hot water is lighter than cold, great surface currents have been formed in both the Atlantic and Pacific
oceans, flowing from the equator to the Arctic re gions ; while the cooler and heavier currents from the Arctic have swept the floor of both oceans from
shore to shore to the southward, carrying all kinds of marine life from the pole toward the equator with them. &quot; It may be well in this connection to allude to an other fact seriously affecting the bottom currents from the pole toward the equator of both air and



CONCLUSION OF PART THIRD. 109
ocean. By reason of the revolution of the earth
upon its axis, a given point upon its surface 1,000 miles south of the North Pole moves to the eastward at the rate of about 260 miles an hour, while another point in the same meridian at the equator would be moving to the eastward a little more than 1,000 miles an hour ; so every cubic yard of air and water which starts in a bottom current from the polar re
gions for the equator must, before reaching the equator, acquire an eastward motion of about 750
miles an hour. The tendency, therefore, of all bot tom currents of air and ocean moving to the south is to press to the westward every obstacle met with in its course, and the result, both as to the currents and all movable things they come in contact with, would be to give them a southwestern course and movement.
&quot; Now it is a strange coincidence, if nothing more, that the eastern coasts of all the continents have a southwestern trend, are full of bays, inlets, and shoal water, as though the floor of the ocean was being
constantly swept up against them ; while the west ern coasts are more abrupt, straight, and touch
deeper water, as though the sweepings from the land were being constantly rolled into the sea along their entire lines.
&quot; Notwithstanding all these indications of a southern or southwestern movement, ever since the
migration of plants and animals first attracted at tention, students of natural science, careful and con
scientious observers, able and discriminating inves
tigators, have, almost with one accord, been looking east and west across these great north and south corrugations and natural barriers for the paths of



HO PARADISE FOUND.
their journeyings ; searching along every parallel of latitude, across lofty mountain ranges, broad con
tinents, deep and wide oceans, and ocean currents, to and fro ; and if perchance they looked north or south it was only in search of some ferry or ford south of the ice-fields by which to pass the flora and fauna from one continent to another, and thus ac
count for what is very evident, namely, that many
widely distributed species and varieties have come
from the same locality and had a common ancestry and origin. Is it not evident that the very plants
and animals (in a tribal sense) whose migrations
they have been engaged in unraveling were as much older than ice and snow on the earth as it would require in time to lower the average temper ature over a vast area from a tropical to a frigid cli mate ?
&quot;
The portion of the little treatise least satisfactory,
even to its author, is the part which relates to man
(pp. 52-54). By making the human race the de
scendants (or, as on Darwinist principles we ought rather to say, the ascendants) of one or more pairs of lower animals, and assuming that our animal an
cestry had already been driven from the polar region before they were blessed with this unanticipated
progeny, the author suggests a possible manner in which &quot; the absence on the earth of our immediate
predecessor,&quot; the missing link, might be accounted
for. He says,
&quot; If it is true that, in common with
many existing plants and animals, the ancestry of
man some animal with a thumb, and so having the possibility of all things shared this northern
home, this common and immensely remote origin, earlier by long epochs than the glacial period, it



CONCLUSION OF PART THIRD. Ill
would afford a possible ground for the claim of the unity of the origin of man, and also a reason for the absence on earth of his immediate predecessor. His arboreal progenitor in the pioneer ranks of this great southern movement, ages before the Quater
nary (during all of which period man has probably inhabited the earth), was possibly driven naked by
the ever-following, merciless cold, thus keeping him
within the southward-moving tropical climate, down the eastern and western continents alike, until it and
he, arriving in the lapse of ages at the equatorial belt, and being always at the head and still rising in
the scale of being by this movement, discipline, and process, became sufficiently advanced by slow de
grees to build fires, clothe himself, make imple ments, and, possibly, domesticate animals, at least the first and most useful to primitive man, the dog, and so prepared for conflict and for all climates, turned backward to the verge of everlasting ice,
subduing, slaying, and exterminating, first his own ancestry, his nearest but now weak rival, which by
lingering behind and struggling for life in a climate
of increasing cold, would have become extremely de
generated and so easily disposed of, if not actually exterminated by the climate itself ; thus leaving as the nearest in resemblance to man, and yet the re motest in actual relationship both to him and to his
ancestry, the later tribes of anthropoid apes since developed, nearer to the equator, from the next lower animals which accompanied him in his south
ward march.&quot;
In this speculation, it will be observed, the place of the origin of the human race is entirely indeter
minate. When its far-off arboreal ancestor left the



112 PARADISE FOUND.
Pole his only prophetic endowment was &quot;a thumb.&quot;
But possessing this, he &quot; had the possibility of all
things.&quot; In his successors, ages afterward, the real transition from the plane of animal to that of human
life seems to be represented as having taken place
&quot;at the equatorial belt.&quot; Unfortunately, however,
for the theory, the claim of the new men to the virtue and name of humanity was now poorer than before the change, for their first act was to turn
fiercely upon those who brought them into being, &quot; subduing, slaying, and exterminating their own an cestry
&quot; in a frenzy worse than brutal. The shock
to the feelings of the near but younger relatives of the massacred victims the mild-mannered apes must have been violent in the extreme. In fact, among all the tens of thousands of their descendants not one, from that day to this, has ever been seen to
smile. But in justice to our author it should be stated
that he attaches little, if any, weight to this Darwin
istic episode. He frankly says,
&quot; This last proposi
tion, however, is but a vague and very deductive supposition, for which nothing is claimed beyond a
possibility or bare probability.&quot; It is possible that he is only slyly indulging in a bit of quiet pleasantry at the expense of the new-school anthropogonists. Whether so or not, he hastens without further words
to return from it to the impregnable positions of his main argument, and to reinforce them by a fresh study of the power and function of heat in the cos mic unfoldment and distribution of life. The next two divisions of the present work will show us that the birth-memories of mankind con
duct us, not to &quot;the equatorial belt,&quot; but to the



CONCLUSION OF PART THIRD. 113
polar world, and that in Mr. Scribner s answer to
the question,
&quot; Where did Life begin ?
&quot; human as well as floral and faunal life should be included. After examining these fresh lines of evidence it is
believed that the reader will find more impressive than ever the words with which our author con cludes his charming tractate : &quot; Thus the Arctic zone, which was earliest in cool
ing down to the first and highest heat degree in the
great life-gamut, was also first to become fertile, first to bear life, and first to send forth her progeny over the earth. So, too, in obedience to the universal
order of things, she was first to reach maturity, first to pass all the subdivisions of life-bearing climate
and finally the lowest heat degree in the great life
range, and so the first to reach sterility, old age, de
generation, and death. And now, cold and lifeless, wrapped in her snowy winding sheet, the once fair mother of us all rests in the frozen embrace of an
ice-bound and everlasting sepulchre.&quot;

CHAPTER I.
ANCIENT COSMOLOGY AND MYTHICAL GEOGRAPHY.
Not enough credit has been given to the ancient astronomers. For instance,
there is no time within the scope of history when it was not known that the earth
is a sphere, and that the direction DOWN at different points is toward the same
point at the earth s centre. Current teaching in the text-books as to the knowl
edge of astronomy by the ancients is at fault. 1 SIMON NEWCOMB, LL. D.

Sub pedibus Styx atra videt manesque profundi. VERGIL.
BACK of every mythological account of Paradise lies some conception of the world at large, and es pecially of the world of men. Rightly to understand and interpret the myths, we must first understand
the world-conception to which they were adjusted.
Unfortunately, the cosmology of the ancients has been totally misconceived by modern scholars. All our maps of &quot; The World according to Homer &quot;
rep resent the earth as flat, and as surrounded by a level,
flowing ocean stream. &quot;There can be no doubt,&quot;
says Bunbury, &quot; that Homer, in common with all his successors down to the time of Hecataeus, believed the earth to be a plane of circular form.&quot; 2 As to
the sky, we are generally taught that the early Greeks believed it to be a solid metallic vault. 3 Pro

fessor F. A. Paley aids the imagination of his readers as follows :
&quot; We might familiarly illustrate the Hesiodic notion of the flat circular earth and the
convex overarching sky by a circular plate with a hemispherical dish-cover of metal placed over it and
concealing it. Above the cover (which is supposed to rotate on an axis, -n-oXos) live the gods. Round
the inner concavity is the path of the sun, giving
light to the earth below.&quot; l
That all writers upon Greek mythology, including even the latest, 2 should proceed upon the same as
sumptions as the professed Homeric interpreters and geographers building upon their foundations is
only natural. And that the current conceptions of the cosmology of the ancient Greeks should pro
foundly affect current interpretations of the cosmo
logical and geographical data of other ancient peo ples is also precisely what the history and inner
relationships of modern archaeological studies would lead one to expect. It is not surprising, therefore, that the earth of the Ancient Hebrews, Egyptians, Indo-Aryans, and other ancient peoples has been
assumed to correspond to the supposed flat earth of the Greeks.3

ANCIENT COSMOLOGY. 1 19
A protracted study of the subject has convinced the present writer that this modern assumption, as to the form of the Homeric earth is entirely base
less and misleading. He has, furthermore, satisfied himself that the Egyptians, Akkadians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Phoenicians, Hebrews, Greeks, Irani ans, Indo-Aryans, Chinese, Japanese, in fine, all the most ancient historic peoples, possessed in their earliest traceable periods a cosmology essen
tially identical, and one of a far more advanced type
than has been attributed to them. The purpose of this chapter is to set forth and illustrate this oldest
known conception of the universe and of its parts. In ancient thought, the grand divisions of the world are four, to wit : the abode of the gods, the abode of living men, the abode of the dead, and, finally, the abode of demons. To locate these in
right mutual relations, one must begin by represent ing to himself the earth as a sphere or spheroid, and as situated within, and concentric with, the
starry sphere, each having its axis perpendicular, and
its north pole at the top. The pole-star is thus in the
true zenith, and the heavenly heights centring about
it are the abode of the supreme god or gods. Ac
cording to the same conception, the upper or north ern hemisphere of the earth is the proper home of
living men ; the under or southern hemisphere of the earth, the abode of disembodied spirits and rulers of the dead ; and, finally, the undermost region of all, that centring around the southern pole of the

heavens, the lowest hell. 1 The two hemispheres of the earth were furthermore conceived of as separated from each other by an equatorial ocean or oceanic
current. To illustrate this conception of the world, let the two circles of the diagram which constitutes the
frontispiece of this work represent respectively the earth-sphere and the outermost of the revolving
starry spheres. A is the north pole of the heavens,
so placed as to be in the zenith. B is the south pole
of the heavens in the nadir. The line A B is the axis of the apparent revolution of the starry heavens
in a perpendicular position. C is the north pole of
the earth ; D its south pole ; the line C D the axis
of the earth in perpendicular position, and coinci dent with the corresponding portion of the axis of the starry heavens. The space I I I I is the abode
of the supreme god or gods ; 2, Europe ; 3, Asia ; 4, Libya, or the known portion of Africa ; 5 5 5, the ocean, or &quot; ocean stream ;
&quot; 666, the abode of dis embodied spirits and rulers of the dead ; 7/77, the lowest hell.2
1 It is worthy of notice that the sight of portions of the southpolar heavens, especially the starless region known as &quot; the black Coal Sack,&quot; is to this day capable of suggesting the associations of the bottomless pit. Thus in a recent traveler s letter of the ordinary kind we read, &quot; Every clear evening we could see the Magellan Clouds, soft and fleece-like, floating airily among the far-off constellations. These mysterious bodies look like star-spray, or borrowed bits of the Milky Way. Then, too, our eyes would seek out, as by some strange fascination, those still more mysterious chambers of the South, the black Coal Sack, with its retreating depths of darkness, wherein no star shines. These irregular spaces, emptinesses, as it were, in the heavens, impress one with a sense of something uncanny, as though these were, indeed, the blackness of darkness forever?

imagine the Tartarean abyss as filled with Stygian
gloom and blackness, fit dungeon-house for de throned gods and powers of evil ; imagine the &quot; men

classic cosmology disappear. We are in the very
world in which immortal Homer lived and sang. 1 It is no longer an obscure crag in Thessaly, from which
heaven-shaking Zeus proposes to suspend the whole earth and ocean. The eye measures for itself the nine days fall of Hesiod s brazen anvil from heaven to earth, from earth to Tartarus. The Hyperboreans
are now a possibility. Now a descmsus ad inferos
can be made by voyagers in the black ship. Un

the passages in which Hades is represented as &quot; be yond the ocean &quot; with those in which it is repre

with the East. The present key explains it per fectly, showing what no one seems heretofore to
have suspected, that the voyage of Odysseus is a
poetical account of an imaginary circumnavigation of the mythical earth in the upper or northern hemi sphere, inc hiding a trip to the southern or under hemi

In this cosmological conception the upright axis of the world is often poetically conceived of as a
majestic pillar, supporting the heavens and furnish ing the pivot on which they revolve. Euripides 1 and Aristotle 2 unmistakably identify the Pillar of Atlas
with this world-axis. How interesting a feature this pillar became in ancient mythologies will be seen below in chapter third of this part, in chapter sec ond of part six, and elsewhere in this volume.
Again, according to this view the highest part of the earth, its true summit, would of course be at the North Pole. And since the whole of the upper or northern hemisphere would in this case be con ceived of as rising on all sides from the equatorial
ocean toward that summit, nothing would be more natural than to view the entire upper half of the earth
as itself a vast mountain, the mother and support of all lesser mountains. 3 Moreover, as the abode of the
supreme God or gods was thought to be directly
over this summit of the earth, it would be extremely easy for the imagination to carry the summit of so

stupendous a mountain into and far above the clouds, and even to extend it to such a height that the gods of heaven might be conceived of as having their
abode upon its top. This is precisely what came to pass, and hence in the cosmology of the ancient Egyp
tians, Akkadians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Indians, Chinese, and others we find, under various
names, but always easily recognizable, this Weltberg, or &quot; Mountain of the World,&quot; situated at the North Pole of the earth, supporting or otherwise connect ing with the city of the
gods, and serving as the axis around which sun, moon, and stars revolve. Often we also find evidence that the under hemisphere was in like manner conceived of as an inverted mountain, antipodal to the mountain
of the gods, and connecting at its apex with the abode of demons. 1 The adjoin

conception of the earth, the upper protuberance be ing the &quot; Mount of the Gods,&quot; the lower the in

World-Mountains is so essential to any right under
standing of mythical geography and of the mythical terrestrial Paradise that a more extended examina
tion of the subject seems a necessity. Beginning with the Egyptians we may note this remarkable fact ; that notwithstanding his sharing
the common and mistaken modern assumption that the Egyptians conceived of the earth as flat, Brugsch,
confessedly the foremost authority in ancient Egyp tian geography, places the highest and most sacred part of the Egyptians earth at the North, making the land there to rise until in actual contact with heaven. He also places at the farthest southern
extremity of the earth another lofty mountain, Ap
en-to or Tap-en-to, literally &quot;the horn of the world.&quot; 1
Now, while several professed Egyptologists have re cently come to the conviction that the earth of the
Egyptians was a sphere, no one has brought out the fact that these two heights are two antipodal polar
projections of the spherical earth, the upper or celes tial one being the mount of the gods, and the lower or infernal one the mount of demons. Of the for mer the following passage in the &quot; Book of Hades &quot;
may naturally be understood to speak :
&quot; Draw me [the nocturnal sun], infernal ones ! . . . &quot;Retreat towards the eastern heavens, toward the
dwellings which support Sar, that mysterious moun tain that spreads light among the gods [or, that I
may spread light among the gods ?], who receive me
when I go forth from amongst you, from the re
treat.&quot; 2

To the inverted infernal mountain seem to apply
the expressions in chapter one hundred and fifty of the &quot; Book of the Dead :
&quot;
&quot; Oh, the very tall Hill in Hades ! The heaven
rests upon it. There is a snake or dragon upon it :
Sati is his name,&quot; etc. 1
In another chapter of the same book a place is
spoken of as &quot; the inverted precinct,&quot; which place is Hades. 2 Moreover, the translator of another text,
called the &quot;Book of Hades,&quot; describes a &quot;pendant mountain &quot; as a curious feature in the vignette illus trations of the original. This can hardly be any thing other than Ap-en-to, the inverted mountain of Hades. 3
1 The mention of the starry serpent or dragon completes the paral lelism between the North Polar and South Polar mountains. &quot; Mr. Procter has remarked that when the North Pole Star was Alpha Draconis, the Southern was most probably the star Eta Hydri, and certain to have been in the constellation Hydra. . . . The encircling Serpent, the symbol of eternal going round, was figured at both Poles, the two centres of the total starry revolution.&quot; Massey, The Natural Genesis, vol. i., p. 345. In our discussion of the Pillar of Atlas we have spoken of the identity of Draco with the dragon which assisted the nymphs in watching the golden apples in the North Polar Gar dens of the Hesperides. See Depuis, Origines des Constellations, p. 147. The same parallelism is alluded to in the following : &quot;The hypocephalus in question is divided into four compartments, two of which are opposed to the two others as if to indicate the two celestial hemi spheres ; the upper one above the terrestrial world and the lower one
below it.&quot; Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archeology, March 4, 1884. London, 1884 : p. 126. See also Revue Archeologique. Paris, 1862 : vi., p. 129. 2 Bunsen, Egypt s Place in Universal History, vol. v., p. 208.

The Akkadians, who antedated even the most an
cient empires of the Tigro-Euphrates valley, had in like manner a &quot; Mountain of the World,&quot; which was unlike all other mountains in that it was a support on which the heavens rested and around which they revolved. It was called Kharsak Kurra. It was so rich with gold and silver and precious stones as to
be dazzling to the sight. An ancient Akkadian
hymn respecting it uses this language :
&quot; O mighty mountain of Bel, Im-Kharsak, whose head rivals heaven, whose root is in the holy deep ! &quot; Among the mountains like a strong wild bull it lieth down.
&quot; Its horn like the brilliance of the sun is bright.
&quot; Like the star of heaven it is filled with sheen.&quot; 1
In another hymn, apparently of great antiquity, we find the goddess Istar addressed as &quot; Queen of this Mountain of the World,&quot; which is further located and identified by its connection with &quot;the axis of
heaven,&quot; and with &quot;the four rivers&quot; of the Akkadian
Paradise. 2

Underworld. The reversed on the same monument are the dead. Thus the Osirified deceased, who has attained the second life, in the Ritual says exultingly, / do not walk upon my head? The dead, as
the Akhu, are the spirits, and the Atua [of the New Zealand legend]
is a spirit who comes walking upside down.&quot; Massey, The Natural Genesis. London, 1883 : vol. i., p. 529. (The italics are Massey s.) The

Lenormant places this mountain in the North (but sometimes incorrectly in the East or Northeast), and
makes it the &quot;lieu de r assembled des dieux /&quot; but
when he locates the corresponding antipodal moun tain of Hades in the West, instead of in the South, he seems to have gone entirely beyond the evidence.
At least, Dr. Friedrich Delitzsch affirms that in the cuneiform literature thus far known he has discov ered no trace of such a location. 1 But on this ques tion of the site of these mountains more will be said
in chapter sixth of the present division.
The Assyrians and Babylonians inherited the
Akkadian conception. One of the titles of the su
preme divinity of the Assyrians related to the sa
cred mount. An invocation to him opens thus :
&quot; Assur, the mighty god, who dwells in the temple
of Kharsak Kurra.&quot; 2 An Assyrian hymn speaks of the
&quot; feasts of the silver mountain,
The heavenly courts,&quot;
and the translator makes the expression refer to
this &quot;Assyrian Olympos.&quot;

&quot; I am lord of the steep mountains, which tremble whilst their summits reach to the firmament.

How current the idea must have been among the
Babylonians is shown by the rhetorical use made of
it by the prophet Isaiah. Rebuking the arrogance of the king of Babylon and pre-announcing to him his doom, the prophet beholds his fall as already ac
complished, and in a passage of wonderful pictorial
power and beauty exclaims, &quot; How art thou fallen
from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning ! howv art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations ! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne
above the stars of God : I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the North (or more correctly in the uttermost parts of the North, in the extreme northern regions), I will as cend above the heights of the clouds ; I will be like (or equal to) the Most High. Yet thou shalt be
brought down to Sheol, to the sides (or regions) of
the pit.&quot;

Since the publication of Gesenius s commentary
on this passage and his excursus upon the &quot; Gotterberg im Norden &quot;
appended to it, no question has re mained in the minds of scholars as to the character
of the Har Moedy the &quot; mount of the congregation,&quot; in the far-off North. Among the Chinese we find a similar celestial mount, the mythical Kwen-lun. It is often called
simply &quot; The Pearl Mountain.&quot; On its top is Para dise, with a living fountain from which flow in oppo site directions the four great rivers of the world. 3

Around it revolve the visible heavens ; and the stars nearest to it, that is nearest to the Pole, are sup posed to be the abodes of the inferior gods and
genii. To this day, the Tauists speak of the first
person of their trinity as residing in &quot; the metropo lis of Pearl Mountain,&quot; and in addressing him turn their faces to the northern sky. 1
A striking parallel to the Egyptian and Akkadian idea of two opposed polar mountains, an arctic and an antarctic, the one celestial and the other infer nal, is found among the ancient inhabitants of
India. The celestial mountain they called Su-Meru, the infernal one Ku-Meru. 2 In the Hindu Puranas
the size and splendors of the former are presented in the wildest exaggerations of Oriental fancy. Its
height, according to some accounts, is not less than eight hundred and forty thousand miles, its diameter at the summit three hundred and twenty thousand.
Four enormous buttress mountains, situated at mu
tually opposite points of the horizon, surround it. One account makes the eastern side of Meru of the color of the ruby, its southern that of the lotus, its
western that of gold, its northern that of coral. On its summit is the vast city of Brahma, fourteen thou sand leagues in extent. 3 Around it, in the cardinal

points and the intermediate quarters, are situated the
magnificent cities of Indra and the other regents of the spheres. The city of Brahma in the centre of the eight is surrounded by a moat of sweet flowing celestial waters, a kind of river of the water of life
(Ganga), which after encircling the city divides into
four mighty rivers flowing towards four opposite points of the horizon, and descending into the equa torial ocean which engirdles the earth. 1
Sometimes Mount Meru is represented as planted so firmly and deeply in the globe that the antarctic or infernal mountain is only a projection of its lower end. Thus the Surya Siddhanta says :
&quot; A collec tion of manifold jewels, a mountain of gold, is Meru,
passing through the middle of the earth-globe (b/mgola\ and protruding on either side. At its upper end are stationed along with Indra the gods and
the Great Sages (maharishis) ; at its lower end, in like manner, the demons have their abode, each
[class] the enemy of the other. Surrounding it on every side is fixed, next, this great ocean, like a
girdle about the earth, separating the two hemi
spheres of the gods and of the demons.&quot;
Conceiving of Meru in this way, as a kind of core
extending through the earth and projecting at each pole, one can easily understand the following pas sage, in which two pole-stars are spoken of instead of one :
&quot; In both \i. e., the two opposite] directions from Meru are two pole-stars fixed in the midst of
the sky.&quot; As these mark the two opposite poles of
Vorbild and Egyptian counterpart of the city of Brahma, the city of Sakra, and all the other Asiatic Gotterstddte in the celestial pole ? It would be very interesting to know. 1 See APPENDIX, Sect. IV. :

the heavens, it is correctly added that &quot;to those who are situated in places of no latitude [i. e., on
the equator] both these pole-stars have their place in the horizon.&quot; Farther on in the same treatise the common designation used for the northern hem
isphere is the hemisphere of the gods, and for the southern the hemisphere of the asuras, or demons. 1
A picture of &quot; the Earth of the Hindus,&quot; showing the exact position of Meru and its buttress-mounts, will be given below in chapter fourth of the present
Part (p. 152). That the cosmology of ancient India should have been retained and propagated in its main features by all the followers of Buddha was only natural.

seven precious substances, gold, silver, lapis-lazuli, crystal, cornelian, coral, and ruby. One of the cities on the summit is called Sudarsana, or Belle-vue. It
is 10,000 yojanas in circuit. The stoned gates are
\\ yojanas high, and there are 1,000 of these gates, fully adorned. Each gate has 500 blue-clad celestial guards, fully armed. In its centre is a kind of inner city called the Golden City of King Sakra, whose
pavilion is 1,000 yojanas in circuit, and its floor is of
pure gold, inlaid with every kind of gem. This royal residence has 500 gates, and on each of the four sides are 100 towers, within each of which there are 1,700 chambers, each of which chambers has within it seven Devis, and each Devi is attended by seven handmaidens. All these Devis are consorts of Ktng
Sakra, with whom he has intercourse in different
forms and personations, according to his pleasure.
The length and breadth of the thirty-three heav ens is 60,000 yojanas. They are surrounded by a sevenfold city wall, a sevenfold ornamental railing, a
sevenfold row of tinkling curtains, and beyond these
a sevenfold row of Talas-trees. All these encircle
one another, and are of every color of the rainbow,
intermingled and composed of every precious sub stance. Within, every sort of enjoyment and every
enchanting pleasure is provided for the occupants. Outside this wonderful city of the gods, there is
on each of its four sides a park of ravishing beauty. In each park there is a sacred tower erected over personal relics of Buddha. Each park has also a

marvels, until in sheer despair the wearied and ex hausted imagination abandons all further effort at
definite mental representation. 1 It is worthy of note that, while most scholars have supposed the Sumeru of Buddhism to be simply a
development of the Indian idea, Mr. Beal, a high
authority, has, in one of his latest publications, claimed for it an independent and coordinate, if not primitive, character. 2 Other peculiarities in Buddhist
cosmography, especially the detachment of Uttarakuru and of Jambu-dvvipa from Mount Meru, in both of which particulars the Buddhist cosmos dif fers from the Puranic, lend some apparent confir mation to this claim. In ancient Iranian thought this same celestial mountain presents itself to the student. Its name
is Hara-berezaiti, the mythical Albordj, 3 &quot; the seat of the genii : around it revolve sun, moon, and stars ; over it leads the path of the blessed to heaven.&quot; 4

The following description of it in one of the invo cations of Rashnu in the Rashn Yasht forcibly re minds one of the Odyssean description of the heav

raiti Bareza ; we invoke, we bless Rashnu.&quot; l
The following description is from Lenormant : &quot; Like the Meru of the Indians, Hara-berezaiti is the
Pole, the centre of the world, the fixed point around which the sun and the planets perform their revolu
tions. Analogously to the Ganga of the Brahmans, it possesses the celestial fountain Ardvi-Sura, the mother of all terrestrial waters and the source of all good things. In the midst of the lake formed by
the waters of the sacred source grows a single mi raculous tree, similar to the Jambu of the Indian
myth, or else two trees, corresponding exactly to
those of the Biblical Gan-Eden. . . . There is the garden of Ahuramazda, like that of Brahma on Meru. Thence the waters descend toward the four cardinal
points in four large streams, which symbolize the four horses attached to the car of the goddess of the sacred source, Ardvi - Sura - Anahita. These four horses recall the four animals placed at the source
of the paradisaic rivers in the Indian conception.&quot;

The Hellenic and Roman myths concerning the &quot; World -mountain &quot; were numerous, but in later
times not a little confused, as Ideler has learnedly
shown. 1 By some, as for example Aristotle, it was
identified with the Caucasus, and it was asserted that its height was so prodigious that after sunset its head was illuminated a third part of the night, and again a third part before the rising of the sun in the morning. This identification explains the
later legend, according to which, in order to prove his rightful lordship of the world, Alexander the Great plucked &quot; the shadowless lance &quot;
(the earth s axis) out of the topmost peak of the Taurus Mountains. 2 More commonly the mount is called Atlas, or the
Atlantic mountain. Proclus, quoting Heraclitus, says of it, &quot;Its magnitude is such that it touches the ether and casts a shadow of five thousand stadia in length. From the ninth hour of the day the sun is concealed by it, even to his perfect demersion under

legendary features characteristic of an earthly Par
adise. The olive - trees were of extraordinary ex cellence, and there were there seven varieties of refreshing wine. He informs us that the grape clusters were a cubit in length, and the vine-trunks sometimes so thick that two men could scarcely clasp round one of them. Herodotus describes the
mountain as &quot; very tapering and round ; so lofty,
moreover, that the top (they say) cannot be seen, the clouds never quitting it either summer or win ter. The natives call this mountain l The Pillar of Heaven, and they themselves take their name from it, being called Atlantes. They are reported not to eat any living thing and never to have any
dreams.&quot; 2 Equally strange is the story told by
Maximus Tyrius, according to which the waves of the ocean at high water stopped short before the
sacred mount, &quot;standing up like a wall around its
base, though unrestrained by any earthly barrier.&quot; &quot; Nothing but the air and the sacred thicket prevent
the water from reaching the mountain.&quot; According to other ancient legends, a river of milk descended from this marvelous height. Noticing such curious stories, Pliny well describes the mountain asfabulosissimum?

yojanas high, and 10,000 in circumference from top to bottom. The

Everywhere, therefore, in the most ancient ethnic
thought, in the Egyptian, Akkadian, Assyrian, Babylonian, Indian, Persian, Chinese, and Greek, everywhere is encountered this conception of what, looked at with respect to its base and magnitude, is called the &quot; Mountain of the World,&quot; but looked at
with respect to its glorious summit and its celestial inhabitants is styled the &quot; Mountain of the Gods.&quot;
We need not pursue the investigation further. Enough has been said to warrant the assertion of Dr. Samuel Beal : &quot;It is plain that this idea of a
lofty central primeval mountain belonged to the un
divided human race.&quot; ! Elsewhere the same learned
sinologue has said, &quot;I have no doubt I can have none that the idea of a central mountain, and of the rivers flowing from it, and the abode of the gods
upon its summit, is a primitive myth derived from the earliest traditions of our race.&quot; 2 The ideas of the ancients respecting the Under world, that is the southern hemisphere of the earth
beyond the equatorial ocean, are sufficiently set forth
in the writer s essay on &quot; Homer s Abode of the
Dead,&quot; printed in the Appendix of the present work. 3 In all these studies one important caution has too often been overlooked. In interpreting the cosmo
logical and geographical references of ancient relig ious writings it should never be forgotten that the
ideas expressed are often poetical and symbolical,
of the followers of Buddha in India insist that it is like a drum, with a swell in the middle, like drums in India ; and formerly in the West, Leucippus said the same thing.&quot; F. Wilford, in Asiatic Researches, vol. viii., p. 273. 1 Buddhist Literature in China, p. 147.

archaeologists of New Zealand were to try to ascer tain and set forth the geographical knowledge of the
Christian England of to-day by a study of a few fragments of English hymns of our period, critically examining every expression about a certain wonder ful mountain, located sometimes on earth and some
times in heaven, and bearing the varying name of
&quot;Sion&quot; or &quot; Zion ;
&quot; then making a microscopical study of all the references to the strange river, which according to the same texts would seem to be va
riously represented as u
dark,&quot; and as possessed of
&quot; stormy banks,&quot; and as &quot;
rolling between &quot; the singer living in England and the abode of the dead located in Western Asia, and called &quot;Canaan,&quot; a river sometimes addressed and represented as so
miraculously discriminating as to know for whom to divide itself, letting them cross over &quot;
dry shod,&quot;
surely, under such a process of interpretation, even the England of the nineteenth century would make
in geographical science a very sorry showing. Or
again, if some Schliemann of a far-off future were to excavate the site of one of the dozen American vil
lages known by the name of &quot;
Eden,&quot; and, finding
unequivocal monumental evidence that it was thus called, were thereupon to conclude and teach that the Americans of the date of that village believed its site to be the true site of the Eden of Sacred His
tory, and that here the race of man originated, this would be a grave mistake, but it would be a mistake precisely similar to many an one which has been
committed by our archaeologists in interpreting and reconstructing the geography of the ancients.



MYTHICAL GEOGRAPHY. 139
In concluding this sketch of ancient cosmology
one further question naturally and inevitably thrusts
itself upon us. It is this : How are the rise and the
so wide diffusion of this singular world-view to be
explained ? In other words, how came it to pass that the ancestors of the oldest historic races and
peoples agreed to regard the North Pole as the true summit of the earth and the circumpolar sky as the true heaven ? Why were Hades and the lowest hell
adjusted to a south polar nadir ? The one and sole
satisfactory explanation is found in the hypothesis of a primitive north polar Eden. Studied from that standpoint, the appearances of the universe would be
exactly adapted to produce this curious cosmological conception. Thus the very system of ancient
thought respecting the world betrays the point of view from which the world was first contemplated. This, though an indirect evidence of the truth of our
hypothesis, is for this very reason all the more con
vincing.



CHAPTER II.
THE CRADLE OF THE RACE IN ANCIENT JAPANESE THOUGHT.
A ccording to the most ancient texts Japan is the centre of the earth. W. E. GRIFFIS.
ACCORDING to the earliest cosmogony of the Jap anese, as given in their most ancient book, the Ko
ji-ki,
1 the creators and first inhabitants of our world
were a god and goddess, Izanagi and Izanani by name. These, in the beginning, we quote from Sir Edward Reed, &quot; standing on the bridge of
heaven, pushed down a spear into the green plain of
the sea, and stirred it round and round. When they drew it up the drops which fell from its end consoli
dated and became an island. The sun-born pair
descended on to the island, and planting a spear in the ground, point downwards, built a palace round
it, taking that for the central roof-pillar. The spear

became the axis of the earth, which had been caused
to revolve by the stirring round.&quot; l
This island, however, was the Japanese Eden. Here originated the human race. Its name was
Onogorojima, &quot;The Island of the Congealed Drop.&quot;
Its first roof-pillar, as we have seen, was the axis of the earth. Over it was &quot; the pivot of the vault of
heaven.&quot; 2 Mr. Reed, who has no theory on the
subject to maintain, says, &quot;The island must have
been situated at the Pole of the earth.&quot; 3 In like
manner, with no idea of the vast anthropological significance and value of the datum, Mr. Griffis re
marks, &quot;The island formed by the congealed drops
was once at the North Pole, but has since been
taken to its present position in the Inland Sea.&quot;
Here, then, is the testimony of the most ancient

2 Leon Metchnikoff, L Empire Japonais. Geneve, 1881 : p. 265. 8 Ibid. Our interpretation of ancient cosmology and of the true Eden location at once brings light into the whole system of Japanese mythology. In the following, extracted from Mr. Griffis, no one has ever before known what to make of &quot; the Pillar of Heaven and Earth&quot;
&quot;the Bridge of Heaven&quot; the position of primitive Japan &quot;on the top of the globe&quot; and at the same time at &quot; the centre of the Earth :
&quot;
* The first series of children born were the islands of Japan. . . . Japan lies on the top of the globe. ... At this time heaven and earth were very close to each other, and the goddess Amaterazu being a rare and beautiful child, whose body shone brilliantly, Izanagi sent her up the Pillar that united heaven and earth, and bade her rule over the high plain of heaven. ... As the earth-gods and evil deities multiplied, confusion and discord reigned, which the sun goddess (Amaterazu), seeing, resolved to correct by sending her grandson Ninigi to earth to rule over it. Accompanied by a great retinue of deities, he descended by means of the floating Bridge of Heaven, on which the divine first pair had stood, to Mount Kirishima. After his descent, heaven and earth, which had already separated to a considerable distance, receded utterly, and further communication ceased. . . . According to the most ancient texts Japan is the centre of the earth.&quot; 4 McClintock and Strong, Cydopadia, vol. ix., p. 688. Art. &quot; Shinto.&quot;

Japanese tradition. Nothing could be more un
equivocal. Izanagi s divinely precious spear of jade, 1 like the transverse jade -tube of the ancient Shu
King, 2 is an imperishable index, not only to the astronomical attainments of prehistoric humanity,
but also to humanity s prehistoric abode. In Part fifth, chapter fourth, further illustration
of the Japanese conception of the origin of their race will be given.

the axis of heaven.



CHAPTER III.
THE CRADLE OF THE RACE IN CHINESE THOUGHT.
The rationalistic genius of the matter-of-fact Chinese is apparent even in the
way in which they conceived their primitive history ; and in this respect, as in many others, it brings them into nearer relations with the best modern science than belong to the other Oriental races. SAMUEL JOHNSON (of Salem).
It is through this wonderfully pure seer [Lao-tse], as it appears to me, that
we ascend to the primitive revelation oj truth given to this ancient people.
WILLIAM HENRY CHANNING.
APPROACHING this theme, a reviewer of the Shin Seen Tung Keen a &quot; General Account of the Gods
and Genii,&quot; in twenty-two volumes offers the fol lowing observations :
&quot; All nations have some tradi
tion of a Paradise, a place of primeval happiness, a state of innocence and delight. The Tauists a are by no means behind in referring to an abode of last
ing bliss, which, however, still exists on earth. It is
called Kwen-lun.&quot; 2
In another article, by a student of Chinese sources,
it is stated, &quot; This locality, being the abode of the gods, is Paradise ; it is round in form, and like Eden
it is the mount of assembly.
&quot; 3
Like the Gan-Eden of Genesis it is described as a

garden, with a marvelous tree in the midst ; also with a fountain of immortality, from which proceed four rivers, which flow in opposite directions toward the four quarters of the earth. 1
In the language of the writer first quoted in this
chapter, &quot;Sparkling fountains and purling streams contain the far-famed ambrosia. One may there
rest on flowery carpeted swards, listening to the melodious warbling of birds, or feasting upon the
delicious fruits, at once fragrant and luscious, which hang from the branches of the luxuriant groves. Whatever there is beautiful in landscape or grand in nature may also be found there in the highest
state of perfection. All is charming, all enchanting, and whilst Nature smiles the company of genii de
lights the ravished visitor.&quot; 2
Where, now, is this Paradise mountain located ? At the North Pole. The sentence before those last quoted reads as follows :
&quot; Here is the great pillar that sustains the
world, no less than 300,000 miles high.&quot; This world-pillar, or axis of the earth, is some times conceived of as slender enough for the use of
a climber. Thus we read, &quot; One of the Chinese kings, anxious to become acquainted with the de
lightful spot, set out in search of it. After much
wandering he perceived the immense column spoken
of, but, trying to ascend it, he found it so slippery that he had to abandon all hopes of gaining his end, and to endeavor by some mountain road which was rugged in the extreme to find his way to Paradise.
When almost fainting with fatigue, some friendly

nymphs, who had all the time from an eminence
compassionated the weary wanderer, lent him an
assisting hand. He arrived there, and immediately began to examine the famous spot.&quot;
1
Such a pillar connecting the earth with an upper Paradise, and affording a means of access thereto, necessarily recalls to mind the analogous conception set forth in the Talmud : &quot;There is an upper and a lower Paradise. And between them, upright, is fixed
a pillar ; and by this they are joined together ; and
t is called The Strength of the Hill of Sion. And by this Pillar on every Sabbath and Festival the righteous climb up and feed themselves with a glance of the Divine majesty till the end of the Sabbath or Festival, when they slide down and return into the
lower Paradise.&quot; 2
In this conception we have a twofold Paradise, one celestial and one terrestrial. Among the Chinese
1 The Chinese Repository, vol. vii., p. 520. 2 Eisenmenger, Entdecktes Judenthum, Bd. ii., p. 318. (English translation, vol. ii., p. 25.) Compare Schulthess, Das Paradies, p. 354. Also the story of Er, the Pamphylian, in which we have the
same &quot; column, brighter than the rainbow, extending right through the whole heaven and through the earth ;
&quot; here also the spirits visiting the earth are allowed seven days before ascending. Plato, Republic, 616. Also the Chaldaeo-Assyrian conception of &quot; the celestial and ter restrial Paradises, supposed to be united by means of the Paradisaic Mount itself.&quot; The Oriental and Biblical Journal. Chicago, 1880 : p. 173. Also the Greek idea: &quot; Sehr merkwiirdig ist, was Pindar
(Olymp., ii., 56 f.) von den Seligen sagt. Wenn sie namlich auf der
Insel der Seligen sich befmden, steigen sie zum Thurme des Chronos empor. Dieser Hohentendenz entspricht nun die alte Vorstellung
vom Naturcentrum am Nordpol und so fiihren uns denn auch die griechischen Dichter auf einem langen Umwege doch zuletzt nach Nysa,
wo uns die griechischen Kiinstler alle Wonnen des dionysischen Himmels aufthun.&quot; Menzel, Die vorchristliche Unsterblichkeitslehre, ii., p. 10. Finally, the Japanese idea in Griffis, The Mikadtfs Empire, p. 44. 10

we find the same. The upper is situated in the cen
tre or pole of heaven, the lower directly under it, at the centre or pole of the northern terrestrial hemi
sphere. The Pillar connecting them is of course the axis of the heavenly vault.
We quote :
&quot; Within the seas, in the valleys of
Kwen-lun, at the northwest is Shang-te s Lower Recreation Palace. It is eight hundred le square, and eighty thousand feet high. In front there are nine walls, inclosed by a fence of precious stones.
At the sides there are nine doors, through which the
light streams, and it is guarded by beasts. Shangte s wife also dwells in this region, immediately over
which is Shang-te s Heavenly Palace, which is situ ated in the centre of the heavens [the celestial pole], as his earthly one is in the centre of the earth [the
terrestrial pole].&quot;
*
There can be no mistaking this use of the term &quot;centre&quot; for pole, for the Chinese astronomers
expressly state, &quot;The Polar star is the centre of
heaven.&quot; 2
Elsewhere, instead of Kwen-lun being a World
pillar in the &quot;valleys,&quot; or &quot;plain,&quot; or &quot;mound&quot; of
the terrestrial Paradise, we find it described as a stu
pendous heaven-sustaining mountain, marking the centre or pole of the earth :
&quot; The four quarters of
the earth incline downwards. . . . On this vast plain or mount, surrounded on all sides by the four seas, arise the mountains of Kwen-lun, the highest in the world according to the Chinese geographers : Kwen

lun is the name of a mountain ; it is situated at the
northwest, fifty thousand le from the Sung-Kaou mountains, and is the centre of the earth. It is eleven
thousand le in height (Kang-he).&quot; 1
The significance of the foregoing as respects the location of Paradise cannot be doubtful. But com pare further the sixth head under chapter third of Part fifth ; also chapter fourth of the same Part.

CHAPTER IV.
THE CRADLE OF THE RACE IN EAST ARYAN OR HINDU THOUGHT.
TJte reader cannot have failed to be struck, as the first explorers of Sanskrit literature have been, with tfa close analogy, -we might even say the perfect iden
tity , of all the essential features of the typical description of Mount Meru in the
Puranas with the topography of Eden in the second chapter of Genesis. The gar
den of Eden (gan-Eden], the garden of God (gan-Elohim, Ezek. xxviii. 13), which
is guarded by the anointed and protecting Kerub (Ezek. xxviii. 14, 16), is placed,
like the garden of delight of the gods of India, on the summit of a mountain, the
holy mountain of God (har qodesh Elohim (Ezek. xxviii. 14, 16), all sparkling with
precious stones (Ibid.).*- LENORMANT.
IN what kind of a world lived the ancient Brah man ? And what was his conception of the location of the cradle of the race ? One of the oldest of the elaborate geographical treatises of India is the Vishnu Purana. Taking
this as a guide, let us place ourselves alongside one of the ancients of the country, and look about us. First, we will look to the South, far down the Indian Ocean. What was supposed to lie in that
1 The continuation of the passage is as follows :
&quot; The Jehovistic writer does not say so in Genesis, but the prophets are express in this respect. The tree of life grows in the midst of the garden (bethoch haggan} with the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Gen. ii. 9 ; iii. 3), exactly like the tree Jambu, in the centre of the delightful pla
teau which crowns the height of Meru. A river goes out of Eden to water the garden, and from thence it divides and forms four arms (Gen. ii. 10). This corresponds in the most precise manner with the way in which the spring Ganga, after having watered the Celestial
Land, or the Land of Joy at the summit of Meru, forms four lakes on the four counterforts of this holy mountain, whence it afterwards flows out in four large rivers toward the four cardinal points.&quot;



PARADISE IN HINDU THOUGHT. 149
direction ? To begin with their distribution of the
different quarters of the world among the gods, this is the quarter belonging to Yama, the god of the dead :
&quot; May he whose hands the thunder wield
Be in the East thy guard and shield ;
May Yama s care the South befriend,
And Varun s arm the West defend ; And let Kuvera, lord of gold, The North with firm protection hold.&quot; l
In precise accordance with our Key to Ancient Cosmology, it is the direction of descent. North is
upwards (uttardt), south is downwards (adhardt}?
Hence the abode and kingdom of Yama is not only to the south, but also below the level of India, i. e., on the under hemisphere, or, as Monier Williams lo cates it, in &quot; the lower world.&quot; 3 All Hindu litera
ture is full of similar references. The exact time
required for the soul s journey was supposed to be four hours and forty minutes.4
In this direction, evidently, we shall vainly seek a paradise. Let us turn to the North and &quot; ascend.&quot;
1 Griffiths, Ramayana, ii. 20. 2 Zimmer, Altindisches Leben. Berlin, 1879 : p. 359.
3 Yama :
&quot; one of the eight guardians of the world as regent of the
South quarter, in which direction in some region of the lower world
is his abode called Yama-pura ; thither a soul, when it leaves the
body, is said to repair, and there, after the recorder, Citra-gupta, has
read an account of its actions, kept in a book called Agra-Sandani,
receives a just sentence, either ascending to heaven, or to the world of the Pitris, or being driven down to one of the twenty-one hells.&quot;
Williams, Sanskrit Dictionary, sub. &quot; Yama.&quot; 4
&quot; The soul is believed to reach Yama s abode in four hours and forty minutes ; consequently a dead body cannot be burned until that
time has passed after death.&quot; W. J. Wilkins, Hindu Mythology, Vedic and Puranic. London, 1882 : Art. &quot;Yama.&quot; See, also, Muir, Sanskrit Texts, v. 284-327, and our references in &quot; Homer s Abode
of the Dead.&quot;



150 PARADISE FOUND.
First, of course, we come to the Himalaya range,
the Himavat of Indian geography. All that por tion of the earth lying between this mountain range and the great ocean to the South constitutes one of
the seven, or nine, &quot;
varshas,&quot; or divisions of the
habitable (upper) hemisphere. Its name is Bharata. If now our ancient Hindu could proceed due North and cross the Himavat, which he does not think possible to mortals, he would find himself in Kimpurusha, an equally extensive but more elevated and beautiful varsha, extending northward till bounded
by a second range of incredibly lofty mountains, the Himakuta. Still &quot;
ascending,&quot; or going North, until he had crossed this division and passed the
Himakuta, he would enter Harivarsha, a still loftier
and diviner country. This extends, in turn, to an other boundary range, the Nishadha, crossing which one would come to Ilavrita, the central varsha of all, which occupies the top as well as the centre of the
world. To the adequate description of the beauty and glory and preciousness of this country no tongue is equal. In its centre is situated the mount of the
gods, &quot;Beautiful Meru,&quot; described in chapter first of the present Part. It is at the Pole, and around it revolve all constellations of heaven. It is the centre of the habitable world.
Continuing our imaginary journey across this di vine country of Ilavrita, crossing of course this co lossal central mountain, we should now begin to de scend on the meridian opposite to that on which we ascended on the India side of the globe. The boun dary of the central region on that side is the Nila range, then comes the varsha of Ramyaka ; its
farther boundary is the Sweta range, beyond which



PARADISE IN HINDU THOUGHT. 151
is the varsha of Hiranmaya. Still descending, we cross this and the range which bounds it on the far
ther side, the Sringin, and we are in Uttarakuru, the last of the seven grand divisions of the earth, the one corresponding, in distance from Meru, to Bha
rata, or our starting-point. It, of course, is on the equatorial ocean, and here too we have only to cross this ocean in order to reach the underworld. The way in which the varshas are made to num
ber &quot; nine &quot;
is by subdividing the great central crosssection of the hemispherical surface, leaving Ilavrita
a perfect square on the top of the globe, the land descending eastward to the sea being called Bhad
rasva, and the corresponding country to the West being called Ketumala. To assist the reader to a clearer conception of this sacred geography we give herewith two cuts, one of which presents in outline the side-aspect of the Puranic earth, and the other a flat polocentric
projection of its upper hemisphere. 1
Having now answered our first question, and
showed in what kind of a world the ancient Hindu lived, we pass to the second :
&quot; What was his con ception of the location of the cradle of the race ?
&quot;
The question is answered the moment we say that
in the Hindu conception and tradition man pro
ceeded from Meru. His Eden-land was Ilavrita. It was therefore at the Pole.
How strange that Lenormant could have written the following, and still have imagined that the true
primeval Eden of the Hindu was anywhere else than
at the terrestrial Pole ! He says,
&quot; In all the leg

ends of India the origin of mankind is placed on Mount Meru, the residence of the gods, a column which unites the sky to the earth. ... At first sight, on reading the description of Mount Meru furnished
by the Puranas, it appears overcharged with so many purely mythological features that one hesi

tates to believe that it has any basis in reality. To
realize these descriptions one must represent one s self in the centre of a vast level and very elevated
surface, surrounded by various mountain-ranges, a gigantic block, the axis of the world, raising its head to the highest point of the heavens, whence there

falls upon its summit, on the North Pole, the divine
Ganga, the source of all rivers, which there dis charges itself into an ideal lake, the Manasa-Saro
vara. . . . Meru, then, is at one and the same time the highest part of the terrestrial world and the cen
tral point of the visible heaven, the two having been confounded through ignorance 1 of the real constitution of the universe : it is also, at one and the same time, the north pole and the centre of the
habitable earth, Jambu-dwtpa, literally of the conti nent of the tree Jambu, the tree of life. Leaving
the higher basin of the mountain in which its wa ters have at first collected the source, Ganga travels seven times round the Meru in descending from the abode of the seven Rishis of the Great Bear, to empty itself afterward into four lakes placed on four
summits adjacent to this vast pyramid, and serving as buttresses on its four sides. . . . Fed by the waters of the celestial Ganga the four lakes in their turn feed four terrestrial rivers which flow out
through the mouths of four symbolical animals. These four great rivers water as many distinct re
gions, . . . and discharge themselves into four oppo site seas, to the east, south, west, and north of the central Meru. . . . The four lakes, the four rivers,
and the four oceans are composed of different liq
uids, corresponding to the four castes, and these latter, with which are connected all the nations of the human race, are reputed to have set out from the four sides of Meru to people the whole earth.&quot; 2

154 PARADISE FOUND.
A similar illustration of the power of a wrong pre
possession is given us in the illustrious Carl Ritter, who after expressly declaring that &quot; the numberless Puranas and their most diverse interpretations by
the Pundits teach that Meru is the middle of the
earth, and itself literally designates its centre and axis? 1 thereupon in the coolest manner imaginable
proceeds to identify the same sacred height with the mountains of Central Asia. Still worse is the
procedure of Mr. Massey, who after locating the Garden of Eden on Mount Meru, and saying explic
itly,
&quot; The Pole, or polar region, is Meru? and again, &quot; Meru is the garden of the Tree of Life? neverthe
less tells us that in equatorial Africa beasts first
grew into men. 2 Happier is the inconsistency of Mr. Lillie, who, despite his adhesion to the flat-earth
theory of Hindu cosmology, still incidentally speaks
of &quot;the blissful Garden&quot; as &quot;at the Pole.&quot; 3

ACCORDING to the sacred books of the ancient Persians all the five-and-twenty races of men which
people the seven &quot;keshvares&quot; of the earth de
scended from one primitive pair, whose names were
Mashyoi and Mashya. The abode of this primitive pair was in the keshvare Kvaniras, the central and the fairest of the seven. 1 Let us see if we can de
termine its location. As a key to the old Iranian conception of the world let us investigate the nature and location of the &quot; Chinvat bridge.&quot; This, like the Bifrost of the Northmen and the Al Sirat of Islam, is the bridge on which the souls of the dead, the evil as well as the good, leave this world to enter the unseen.2 The
investigation is in itself and for its own sake full of interest, for no writer on the ideas and faith of the

Mazdaeans has ever professed to be able to tell either the origin or true meaning of the myth. Most
interpreters have either carefully abstained from all
attempts at explanation, or have suggested that it probably refers to the rainbow or to the Milky Way,
or to both. 1 To dispose of these suggestions, let us
raise a few questions :
1. Do we find in any part of the Avestan liter ature any evidence that the Chinvat Bridge pos sessed a curvilinear form ? None.
2. Straight, or curved as a whole, were its two ends conceived of as on a common level ? No, for motion upon it in one direction is described as upward, and in the opposite direction as down ward. 3. Where was the upper end ? In the heaven of Ahura Mazda, the Supreme God, to whose abode the bridge conducts good souls. 4. But where is this abode ? At the Northern Pole of the sky, as elsewhere shown. 5. Where is the earthward end ?
It rests upon &quot;the Daitik peak.&quot; 6. Is this peak in Persia ?
No ; it is part of a sacred mountain in Airan-vej,
the Eden of Iranian tradition.
7. And where is Airan-vej ? &quot; In the middle of the world.&quot;
1 &quot;The Bridge of Souls cannot be always the Milky Way. . . .

been passed on to the Rainbow, the name of the former might also
have been inherited by the latter.&quot; C. F. Keary, Primitive Belief.

religion were first created.
9. And in what direction from Persia was Airan
vej supposed to lie ? Far to the North. 10. What natural &quot; centre of the earth &quot;
is situ ated in that direction ? The North Pole. 11. What other evidence is there that the Daitik peak is at the North Pole ? The fact that the mountain of which this is simply
&quot;the peak of judgment&quot; is Hara-berezaiti, around which the heavenly bodies revolve, and which, as all allow, answers to the north polar Su-Meru of the Hindus. 1 12. Then the Chinvat bridge extends from the North Pole of the heavens to the North Pole of the
earth : what is its shape ?
It is &quot;beam-shaped&quot; To quote the sacred book : &quot; That bridge is like a beam, of many sides, of whose
edges there are some which are broad, and there are some which are thin and sharp ; its broad sides are
so large that its width is twenty-seven reeds, and its sharp sides are so contracted that in thinness it is just like the edge of a razor. And when the souls of the righteous and wicked arrive, it turns to them that side which is suitable to their necessities.&quot; 2
1
&quot; Like the Meru of the Indians, Hara-berezaiti is the pole and centre of the world, the fixed point around which the sun and the planets perform their revolutions.&quot; Lenormant, &quot; Ararat and Eden,&quot; in the Contemporary Review, September, 1881. Am. ed., p. 41.

The Chinvat bridge, then, is simply the axis of the northern heavens, the Pillar of Atlas, the Talmudic &quot; Strength of the Hill of Sion,&quot; the column which in
the Chinese legend the emperor vainly sought to
climb ! In solving this long-standing problem we have at the same time unlocked the mystery which has hitherto attached to Bifrost and Al Sirat. 1 But in locating our bridge we have located the
Persian Eden. And the location is unquestionably at the North Pole. More than this, we have made clear the fact that in the mythical or sacred geog
raphy of this ancient people the world of living men
was originally the northern circumpolar hemisphere. The arrangement of the keshvares now becomes entirely clear.2 Like the divinely beautiful Ilavrita varsha of the Hindus, &quot; illustrious Kvaniras &quot; holds
the central position. In its centre, as in the centre
&quot; guardian of the road to the invisible world,&quot; is wife to Ru, &quot; the
supporter of the heavens.&quot; Gill, Myths and Songs of the South Pa
cific. London, 1876: p. 51. So if Heimdallr s true station were at the top of the rainbow, his title &quot;son of nine mothers&quot; (Vigfusson
and Powell, Corpus Poeticum Boreale, London, 1883, ii. 465) would
have no such obvious significance as our interpretation gives.
1 One of the etymologies of Chinvat makes it the &quot; Bridge of the
Judge.&quot; (Haug, Essays, 2d ed., p. 165 n.) As among the ancient
Assyrians, and some other peoples, the pole star has been styled
&quot; the judge of heaven,&quot; it is possible that we have here at once the
origin of the name and a new identification of the position of the
mythical &quot;beam-shaped&quot; bridge. It is interesting to note in this
connection that Heimdallr, the Norse god who stands at the top of
Bifrost, is also, etymologically considered, the &quot;World-judge&quot; or
&quot; World-divider.&quot; Menzel, Unsterblichkeitslehre , i. 134- In Plato
(Repub., 614 ff.) the judge stands at the bottom of the column. For
grotesque survivals of the Bridge of Souls in folklore, see Tylor, Primitive Culture, Index. 2 The diagram attempted by Windischmann, Zoroastrische Studien,
p. 67, is inconsistent with the Bundahish, ch. v., 9. So must be every attempt to arrange the keshvares on a flat earth.

of Ilavrita, is the holiest mount in the world. Di rectly over it is the true heaven. In this central polar country North and South and East and West would have no application ; but speaking from their
own geographical standpoint as south of Airan-vej, the Persians located to the east of this holy central Kvaniras the keshvare Savah, to the west Arzah, to the south the keshvares Fradadafsh and Vidadafsh, and to the north Vorubarst and Vorugarst.1 This gives a map of the northern hemisphere which in a

It would be a fascinating task to reinterpret the whole Avestan literature and mythology in the new
light of this recovered geography and cosmology, but this would require a book of itself. It is worthy of remark that the Venidad expressly calls the earth
&quot;
round,&quot; and apparently recognizes the existence of
its two far-separated poles. 1 As we have seen, its Chinvat bridge or beam, which is also an idea so an cient as to be found in the Avesta itself (Farg., xix.,
30, et passim], is the axis of the world, conducting good souls by an upward &quot;
flight
&quot; into the north
polar heaven of Ahura Mazda, but the evil by a fall &quot; headforemost &quot; into the south polar hell. 2 Airan
vej, or &quot; Old Iran,&quot; was the most natural name in the world for the Iranians to give to the traditional
birth-place of their race. 3 But all attempts to find it &quot; on the banks of the Aras &quot; or &quot; in the far-off lands

of the rising sun &quot; 1 are entirely useless. Equally
mistaken is the gloss which merely makes it &quot; prim itively&quot; the mythic land where the disembodied
&quot;souls of the righteous&quot; are assembled by Ahura
Mazda. 2 The same must be said of the assertion that &quot;the real site of the Airan-vej in its ancient and
original conception is to the east of the Caspian Sea
and of Lake Aral.&quot; 3 By every particular of its de
scription it is identified with the Daitik peak, with
Hara - berezaiti, with the polar &quot;
river,&quot; the polar
&quot;tree,&quot; the polar &quot; centre &quot; of the upper hemisphere.
It is simply the Arctic Eden of humanity remem
bered as it was before the Evil One entered, and &quot; by his witchcraft counter-created winter and the worst
of plagues.&quot;
4 This being the case we need not won
der that in a paper on &quot;The Aryan Birth-place,&quot; read in January, 1884, before the Royal Society of Literature, Mr. C. J. Stone expressed his strong doubt of the current doctrine that the cradle of the
Aryans was the upper valleys of the Oxus.5 The

Grill is so bewildered by the number of attempted iden tifications that he pronounces the land a purely mythical one, and denies to the name all historic or geographic reality. Erzvater, i. 218, 219. 4 Fargard, i. 3. The passage continues, &quot; There are (now) ten winter months there, two summer months ; and those are cold for the waters, cold for the earth, and cold for the trees.&quot; This reminiscence of the on-coming of the Glacial Age at the Pole also appears in the

it. Still more positive and emphatic is Karl Penka, who boldly lo cates the original home of the Aryans in Scandinavia. See his

CHAPTER VI.
THE CRADLE OF THE RACE IN ANCIENT AKKADIAN, ASSYRIAN, AND BABYLONIAN THOUGHT.
We have here, even to the most minute details, an exact reproduction of the
Aryan conception of Mount Meru, or Albordj, with its accessories. Here is the
abode of the heavenly hierarchy, located on the summit oftJie Kharsak, or sacred
mount which penetrates the heavens exactly in the region of the Pole star. REV. O. D. MILLER.
WE have already seen that the prehistoric inhab itants of the Tigro-Euphrates basin, called by some Akkadians, by others Sumerians, by yet others Akkado-Sumerians, had like other Asiatic peoples their Mountain of the World, on whose top was the celes tial Paradise, and around which sun, moon, and stars revolved. Our present task is to locate this moun
tain more exactly, and to consider its significance
for our hypothesis respecting the site of Eden. That the earth, as conceived of by this ancient
people, was spherical is not at the present day ques tioned. With their ideas probably no archseologist was more familiar than the late Francois Lenormant, and he expresses himself as follows :
&quot; The
Chaldees, says Diodorus Siculus (lib. ii., 31), have quite an opinion of their own about the shape of the earth ; they imagine it to have the form of a boat turned upside down, and to be hollow underneath. This opinion remained to the last in the Chaldaean sacerdotal schools ; their astronomers believed in
it, and tried, according to Diodorus, to support it by



1 64 PARADISE FOUND.
scientific arguments. // is of very ancient origin, a remnant of the ideas of the purely Akkadian period.
. . . Let us imagine, then, a boat, turned over ; not such an one as we are in the habit of seeing, but a round skiff, like those which are still used under the name of Kufa on the shores of the lower Tigris and
Euphrates, and of which there are many represen tations in the historical sculptures of the Assyrian
palaces ; the sides of this round skiff bend upwards
from the point of the greatest width, so that they are shaped like a hollow sphere deprived of two thirds of its height [?], and showing a circular open ing at the point of division. Such was the form of the earth according to the authors of the Akkadian magical formulae and the Chaldaean astrologers of
after years. We should express the same idea in the
present day by comparing it to an orange of which the top had been cut off, leaving the orange upright upon the flat surface thus produced. The upper and convex surface constituted the earth properly so called, the inhabitable earth (ki) or terraqueous sur face (ki-a\ to which the collective name kalama, or
the countries, is also given.&quot;
1
It is well known that in minor details Diodorus is
often found not altogether trustworthy. He was not a critical reporter. While, therefore, in the above
quotation he has undoubtedly preserved to us one of the ancient Chaldaean similes,2 by the use of which the true figure of the earth was taught, I can but think that the statement as to the hollowness of the
1 Chaldaan Magic, p. 150. 2 The figure was also used by the Egyptians, and other ancient na tions. See Wilford, in Asiatic Researches, vol. viii., p. 274. Also articles and works on &quot; The Ark &quot; and &quot; Arkite Symbols.&quot;



PARADISE IN AKKADIAN THOUGHT. 165
earth underneath is an unauthorized inference, sug gested by the hollow boat, and made by the compar
atively uninstructed Greek solely upon his own re
sponsibility. It is true that, in the same work from which the above extract is taken, Lenormant endeav ors to adjust Akkadian cosmology to such a notion
of a hollow sphere, saying,
&quot; The interior concavity
opening from underneath was the terrestrial abyss,
ge, where the dead found a home (kur-nu-de, ki-gal,
aralli). The central point in it was the nadir, or, as
it was called, the root, uru&amp;gt; the foundation of the whole structure of the world ; this gloomy region wit nessed the nocturnal journey of the sun.&quot; 1 But noth ing can be more evident on examination than that this attempt involves the writer in at least three in consistencies : First, if the sun visits the interior of the earth at night, its proper orbit cannot be round and round the Mountain of the World to the north east of Babylonia, as our author elsewhere repre
sents. Second, if aralli, the abode of the dead, is in the interior of the hollow earth, it cannot be to the
northeast of Babylonia, as it is represented to be in the context. Third, if the earth was conceived of as hollow, of course its whole central portion was
empty space; but according to this presentation its central point &quot;was called the root, uru, the foun dation of the whole structure of the world.&quot; Surely the foundation of the world can scarcely have been
supposed to be mere emptiness. To a layman in
these studies this uru would much rather suggest

root-land,&quot; is applied to the same subterranean region of darkness in Japanese mythology. See &quot;

the antarctic Tap-en-to mountain of ancient Egyp
tian thought, the Ku-Meru of ancient India. But it is time to return to the Akkadian, or Ak
kado-Sumerian, mountain of the gods. Again we quote Lenormant :
&quot; Above the earth extended the
sky (ana), spangled with its fixed stars (mul), and revolving round the Mountain of the East (Kharsak Kurra), the column which joins the heavens and the earth, and serves as an axis to the celestial vault.
The culminating point in the heavens, the zenith
(nuzkti), 1 was not this axis or pole ; on the contrary, it was situated immediately above the country of Akkadia, which was regarded as the centre of the inhabited lands, whilst the mountain which acted as a pivot to the starry heavens was to the northeast of
this country. Beyond the mountain, and also to the northeast, extended the land of aralli, which was very rich in gold, and was inhabited by the gods and
blessed spirits.&quot;
2
Here we have the &quot; Mountain of the East &quot; lo
cated, not in the east, but in the northeast. Else
where our author recognizes most fully the identity of this mount with the Har-Moed of Isaiah xiv. 14,
and the difficulty of placing it anywhere but at the
North Pole. 3 He adduces from the cuneiform texts no evidence whatever for a location to the &quot; north east,&quot; and seems to fix upon that direction only as a compromise of his own. &quot; Nous devons conclure &quot;

PARADISE IN AKKADIAN THOUGHT.
This, in reality, instead of being a rea son for searching among the mountains to the east
of Assyria or Babylonia, is, when rightly understood, precisely an additional reason for looking to the north. 2 One other statement in the extract calls for no tice. The writer seems to have anticipated that his readers would inevitably locate a mountain, described as &quot;the column which joins the heavens and the
earth, and serves as an axis to the celestial vault,&quot; under the celestial pole ; and believing that the cuneiform texts which locate the celestial pole di
rectly over Akkad (or Akkadia), &quot; the centre of the inhabited lands,&quot; to be inconsistent with such a loca tion, he introduces the remark that &quot; the culminat ing point in the heavens &quot; was &quot; not the axis or pole ;
on the contrary, it was situated immediately over
the country of Akkadia, which was regarded as the centre of the inhabited lands, whilst the mountain which acted as a pivot to the starry heavens was to the northeast of this country.&quot;
1 The following from his latest account of the mountain will be val ued :
&quot; La montagne des pays est le lieu ou resident les dieux. . . . Elle est situee au nord, vient de nous dire Yescha yahou ; a 1 est disent les documents cuneiformes, ou 1 expression accadienne garsag
babbara= assyriene sad fit samsi, la montagne du levant, apparait
comme synonyme de 1 accadien garsag kurkurra = assyrien sad matati ; d ou nous devons conclure que c est au nord-est du bassin de
1 Euphrate et du Tigre qu on la supposait placee. C est elle qui vaut a
1 orient, son nom accadien de mer kurra et son nom assyrien de sadti signifiant tous les deux le point cardinal de la montagne. Et le sens de ce terme est bien precise par la variante accadienne mer garsag, oil ce mot, dont le sens la montagne est incontestable, se substitue a son synonyme kur, dont la signification cut pu etre douteuse.&quot; Les Origines de VHistoire, vol. ii., I, p. 126. 2 See Menzel, Die vorchristliche Unsterblichkeitslehre, Bd. i., chap ter entitled &quot; Der Sonnengarten am Nordpol,&quot; pp. 87-93.

From so eminent an authority one naturally hesi tates to differ ; but inasmuch as M. Joachim Menard, in a work as recent as the one from which we have quoted, while agreeing with M. Lenormant in mak ing Akkad the traditional &quot; centre of the earth,&quot; dif
fers from him in locating precisely in this central country &quot; the mountain on whose apex the heaven of
the fixed stars is pivoted,&quot;
1 we cannot avoid the conclusion that Lenormant s distinction between the zenith of Akkad and the celestial pole is based upon
a misapprehension, and is productive only of con fusion. The solution of all difficulties is found the moment the mythological Akkad is made a cir
cumpolar mother-country, after which the Akkad of the Tigro-Euphrates valley was commemoratively named.2 This supposition is made all the easier by three noteworthy facts : (i) that both the names
Akkad and Sumir are not Assyrio-Babylonian, but loan - words from an older prehistoric tongue ;
3
(2) that the etymological signification and appella
tives of Akkad thoroughly identify it with the lofty country at the north polar summit of the earth ;

and (3) that recently discovered tablets are compel
ling the Assyriologists to recognize two Akkads, one in the Tigro-Euphrates valley and one much farther to the North, though as yet none of these scholars have looked as far in that direction as to the Pole. 1 If further proof were needed that the Kharsak Kurra of the earliest inhabitants of Mesopotamia was identical with the north polar World-mountain
of Egypt and the surrounding Asiatic nations, it
would be found on investigating their conceptions of the region of the disembodied dead and their notion of a mountain of the rulers of the dead antipodal to the mount of the gods. The Akkadians, like the ancients generally, conceived of the realm of the dead as located to the South. Their underworld be ing simply the under or southern hemisphere of the earth, they could not place it in any other direction. In naming the cardinal points the Akkadians there
fore called the South &quot;\hefunereal point.&quot;
2 In this quarter was located the mount of the rulers of the
tagne.&quot; Also Smith, The Phonetic Values of the Cuneiform Charac ters. London, 1871 : p. 17. 1 See Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaology, London, Nov.-Dec., 1 88 1. &quot;Mr. Pinches, in a further communication on the &quot;Paris Tablet [in cuneiform characters, but supposed to be Cappado
cian in origin], observes : The question of the original home of the Akkadians is affected thereby. ... As it seems that the country north of Assyria was also called Akkad, as well as the northern part of
Babylonia, the neighborhood of Cappadocia as the home of the Ak kadian race may be regarded as a very possible explanation, etc. &quot; Brown, Myth of Kirkt. London, 1883 : p. 87. Finzi, in his Carta

dead. It was the under or south polar projection
of the earth. It corresponded with the south polar mount of demons in Hindu and in Egyptian thought. Even Lenormant, whose mistake in locating the mount of the gods in the East, logically leads to the mistake of locating this mount of the rulers of
the dead in the West, still unconsciously gives evi dence as to the true location by stating that it is
&quot;situated in the low-down portions of the earth.&quot; 1
And elsewhere he has told us that in the Akkadian language to descend and to go southward were sy
nonymous expressions.2
With Professor Friedrich Delitzsch, then, we lo cate the Akkadian Kharsak Kurra at the North.3 Once make the primeval Akkad the equivalent of Ilavrita in Hindu, or of Kvaniras in Iranian, mythol
ogy, and all is perfectly plain and self-consistent.
The primitive Akkad is now &quot;the centre of all
lands &quot; in the same sense in which Ilavrita and
Kvaniras are in their respective systems. As in both these systems the mount of the gods is in the
centre of this central country, so is Kharsak Kurra. Su-Meru and Hara-berezaiti and Kwen-lun are
each exactly under the Pole-star, having it in their
zenith ; the same is true of Kharsak Kurra. As every splendor of a divine abode crowns the top of
all the former, so is the summit of Kharsak resplen dent beyond description. As the sun, moon, and
stars revolve around the Hindu and Iranian and Chinese mounts, so is Kharsak the point &quot; on which

the heaven of the fixed stars is pivoted.&quot; Moreover from its top flows that Eden river, which, like Gunga and Ardvi-Sura, waters the whole earth. 1 Under these circumstances the candid reader will
probably be prepared to agree with the statement
of Mr. Miller which we have made the motto to this
chapter, and to say with Gerald Massey, only with
better understanding than his, &quot;The cradle of the
Akkadian race was the Mountain of the World/ that Mount of the Congregation in the thighs of the North. . . . The first mount of mythology was
the Mount of the Seven Stars, Seven Steps, Seven
Stages, Seven Caves, which represented the celestial North as the birth-place of the initial motion and
the beginning of time. This starting-point in heaven above is the one original for the many copies
found on the earth below. . . . The Akkadians date from Urdhu, the district of the northern Mountain
of the World.&quot; 2

CHAPTER VII.
THE CRADLE OF THE RACE IN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN THOUGHT.
According to the Kamite legend related by Diodorus, Osiris and Isis lived to
g-ether in Nysa, or Paradise. Here there was a garden wherein the deathless
dwelt. Here they lived in perfect happiness until Osiris was seized with the de
sire to drink the water of immortality . Then he went forth in search of it, and
fell. . . But an earlier couple than Osiris and Isis was Sevekh and Ta-urt, who
as the two constellations of the seven stars revolving round the Tree, or Pole, were the primeval pair in Paradise. The Natural Genesis.
THE mythical geography of the ancient Egyptians is as yet too little known to allow us to hope for much
light from this quarter on the question of the site of
Eden. Even their cosmology is little understood, and their scientific attainments are by many inexcus ably underestimated. So good a scholar as Mr. Vil
liers Stuart could recently write, &quot; The Egyptians had not attained to a sufficiently advanced point in science to solve the problem of how the sun in his
daily course, having sunk behind the western hori zon, returned to rise at the opposite quarter of the
heavens.&quot; 1 Nevertheless, as we desire to test our
hypothesis as far as possible by all most ancient tra ditions and myths, whether favorable or unfavorable,
we must inquire whether anything can be ascer tained as to the ideas of the ancient Egyptians touch

ing the form of the earth and the theatre of man s
first history. The leading features of Egyptian cosmology, as interpreted by the present writer, are in perfect ac cord with the cosmological ideas of other ancient nations as described in chapter first of the present
division. They may be briefly expressed in the six
following theses : 1. That in ancient Egyptian thought the earth was conceived of as a sphere, with its axis perpen dicular and its North Pole at the top. 2. That in the earliest time Amenti was conceived of neither as a cavern in the bowels of the earth, nor as a region of the earth to the West, on the same general plane as the land of Egypt, but was simply the under or southern hemisphere of the earth, conceived of as just described. 3. That the Tat pillar symbolized the axis of the
world (heaven and earth) upright in space. 4. That Ta nuter, whatever its later applications, originally signified the extreme northern or topmost point of the globe, where earth and heaven were fa bled to meet. 5. That Cher-nuter was the inferior celestial hemi

their correctness has come to light. See, for example, the new The saurus Inscriptionum of Brugsch, pp. 176, 177, et passim.

like that of the ancient Asiatic nations, was spherical, what was their conception of its northern terminus ? In chapter first of this Part, some indication has
been already given. But our present investigation demands a fuller answer to this question. Turning to the great work of Brugsch on the &quot; Geographical
Inscriptions of the Old -Egyptian Monuments,&quot; we find that the Egyptians considered the farthest limit
in the North to be &quot;the four pillars or supports of heaven.&quot; l The fact that these four supports of
heaven, instead of being situated in four opposite directions from Egypt, are all in the farthest North,
is very significant. It shows that though the people might speak of heaven as supported on four pillars, it is not to be inferred therefrom that they conceived of the earth as flat, and of the sky as a flat Oriental
roof one story above it. 2 Brugsch himself, though
writing upon the supposition that the Egyptians earth was flat, avoids this mistake. His inference, coming from one who had a traditional wrong theory
to support, is most interesting and valuable. He
says,
&quot; Inasmuch as these four supports of heaven, the northern limit of the earth as known to the Egyptians, nowhere else occur as name of people,
land, or river, it seems to me most probable that we have herein the designation of a high mountain which was perhaps characterized by four peaks, or

which consisted of four ranges, from which pecu
liarity it received its name. Like all peoples of an tiquity, at least all those whose literature has come down to us, the Egyptians conceived of the earth as rising toward the North, so that at last at
its northernmost point it joined the sky and sup
ported it.&quot;
1
In the Buddhist conception of Meru, as given in
chapter first of this Part, we have precisely the four
peaked, heaven-supporting mountain which Brugsch here describes :
&quot; Each of the four corners of the
mountain-top has a peak seven hundred yojanas
high.&quot; It is not impossible that in the four dwarfs which support the dome of the modern Buddhist temple we have a far-off survival of ancient Egypt s
&quot; four supports of heaven.&quot; Certainly the Buddhist
temple-roofs symbolize the circumpolar heaven, 2 and a recent author, touching upon the latter s mytholog ical support, writes as follows :
&quot; This prop passing through the earth and the heavens at the pole, indi cated as we have seen by the Alpha of Draco, be came the nail of the old astronomers, the point round which all nature revolved. Between earth and the celestial pole the prop idea was again brought forward as the central column of a huge
conical mountain, Mount Meru, guarded at each cardinal point by a mighty king. The four dwarfs propping up some of the columns in the old Bud
dhist temples are evidently these four kings. . . .
When the prop pierced the highest heaven it was a spire called the *
tee, and in Nepal it is confessedly

in all the temples the symbol of Adi Buddha, the supreme, in his heavenly garden, Nandana grove.&quot;
l
But returning from this merely curious question,
we remind ourselves that we have seen reason to believe that the ancient Egyptians conceived of the
earth as a sphere, with a heaven-supporting moun tain in the extreme North. In the extreme South
was another mountain, &quot;The Horn of the World,&quot;
represented as of incredible height (eight atur or stadia). 2 This corresponds so perfectly with the earth of the Puranas, with its Su-Meru and Ku-Meru,
that we are irresistibly impelled to inquire whether the parallelism extends any farther.
We take the question of the direction of the abode of the dead. All agree that in Indian thought the abode of the dead is in the South. So was it in the
thought of the ancient Egyptian. The recently dis covered epitaph of Queen Isis-em-Kheb, mother-inlaw of Shishak, king of Assyria (circa 1000 B. c.), thus reads :
&quot; She is seated all beautiful in her place
enthroned, among the gods of the South she is crowned with flowers. She is seated in her beauty
in the arms of Khonsou, her father, fulfilling his desires. He is in Amenti, the place of departed
spirits.&quot;
3
Again, in the mythological earth of India, the abode of the dead, being the southern or under hemi sphere, is looked upon as inverted. Viewed from
the standpoint of gods and men, it is bottom up ward, and its inhabitants move about head down

ward. 1 The same is true of Amenti, the Egyptian underworld, and of its inhabitants. 2
Again, in Hindu thought all deadly influences pro ceed from the South, the abode of death ; all benefi cent and life-giving influences from the North. The
same is true in ancient Egyptian thought. &quot;It is
curious,&quot; says the English editor of Lenormant s &quot; Chaldaean Magic,&quot;
3 &quot;it is curious that in Egypt
all good and healing and life proceeded from the West, the land of the setting sun, and all evil from the East the land of its rising.&quot; The statement is
&quot;
curiously
&quot; incorrect. The North is the sacred quarter, and from the North come life and blessing. The North wind is the very breath of God. It
&quot;proceeds from the nostrils of Knum and enlivens
all creatures.&quot; 4 It is one of the high prerogatives
of the blessed dead to &quot;breathe the delicious air
of the North wind.&quot; 5 That they may breathe it is

the prayer of bereaved affection. 1 The &quot; Fields of Peace &quot; are at the North of the fields of Sanehem-u. 2 There is the proper home of the great god of whom
the Nile poet sang:
&quot; There is no building that can contain him ! &quot; There is no counselor in thy heart !
&quot; Thy youth delight in thee, thy children ;
&quot; Thou directest them as King. &quot; Thy law is established in the whole land, &quot; In the presence of thy servants in the North&quot;
Of the same god it is said :
&quot; He createth all works therein, &quot; All writings, all sacred words, &quot; All his implements, in the North.&quot; 3
As yet no texts have been discovered which rep
resent the earliest Egyptian ideas of the origin of
man and the location of his birth-place. One proof, however, that man was conceived of as having pro ceeded from the &quot; Land of the Gods &quot; in the North appears in connection with the myth of the reign of
Ra. In Egyptian mythology, the reign of Ra was like the primeval reign of Kronos ; the myth of it was a reminiscence of the sinless Golden Age. 4 But

in those primeval and perfect days men still dwelt
in the country of the gods, which country, as we
have seen, was in the highest North. And because
they still occupied the heaven - touching mountain, the rebellion by which they forfeited their estate of
blessedness is expressly described as &quot;on the moun
tain,&quot;
1 an object not easily found in Egypt. The same teaching is further supported by the language of certain scholars, who, without any par ticular theory as to the location of Eden, have held that the hieroglyph used in Egyptian texts as the determinative prefix to names designating civilized
lands, ^, is simply a pictorial symbol of primitive
Eden divided by its fourfold river. 2 A writer in the Edinburgh Review, said to be Mr. Walter Wilkins, remarks :
&quot; The Buddhists and Brahmans, who
together constitute nearly half the population of the world, tell us that the decussated figure of the cross,
whether in a simple or complex form, symbolizes the traditional happy abode of their primeval ances
tors, the Paradise of Eden toward the East, as we find it expressed in the Hebrew. And, let us ask,
what better picture or more significant characters,

in the complicated alphabet of symbolism, could have been selected for the purpose than a circle and a cross ? the one to denote a region of absolute
purity and perpetual felicity, the other those four perennial streams that divided and watered the sev
eral quarters of it.&quot;
1 Mr. Wilkins claims that in
the Egyptian hieroglyph above given we have the
same symbol as in the Indian Swastika. It was
therefore primeval Paradise which was commemo rated by &quot;the sacred circular cakes of the Egyp
tians, composed of the richest materials, of flour,
of honey, of milk, and with which the serpent and bull, as well as the other reptiles and beasts conse crated to the service of Isis and their higher divin ities, were daily fed, and which upon certain festi
vals were eaten with extraordinary ceremony by the
people and their priests.&quot; He continues, &quot; The cross-cake, says Sir Gardiner Wilkinson, was their hieroglyph for civilized land/ obviously a land
superior to their own, as it was, indeed, to all mun dane territories ; for it was that distant, traditional
country of sempiternal contentment and repose, of
exquisite delight arid serenity, where Nature, unas sisted by man, produces all that is necessary for his
sustentation.&quot;
&quot;
This,&quot; says Donnelly, though arguing in favor of a mid-Atlantic island-Eden, &quot; this was the Garden of Eden of our race. ... In the midst of it was a sacred and glorious eminence, the umbilicus orbis terrarum, toward which the heathen in all parts

of the world, and in all ages, turned a wistful gaze
in every act of devotion, and to which they hoped to be admitted, or rather to be restored, at the close of this transitory scene. &quot; 1
In Part fifth, chapter fourth, it will be shown that the umbilicus orbis terrarum is indisputably the ter restrial pole.
Finally, if, as Plato represents, the story of lost Atlantis was received from Egypt, and constituted a
part of the priestly teaching of the dwellers upon the Nile, our next chapter will present us further evidence that the Eden and the antediluvian world of ancient Egyptian tradition were precisely where the tradition of other ancient peoples placed them, to wit, in the land of sacred memories in the far-off, faerie North.

RESPECTING the origin of men there were among

naturally think the first men came from these ;
others, inhabiting a valley, would more naturally think of their ancestors as having come out of the water. The Asiatic-Greek belief that the first of the human race were made out of trees he calls
&quot;
quite peculiar.&quot;

all these notions were merely fragments of an old,
old faith, according to which man originated on the mountain of all mountains, by the source of all wa ters, and under the tree of all trees !
However this may be, it is certainly very interest

PARADISE IN GREEK THOUGHT. 183
ing to note that in the Greek myth of Meropia, or
Meropis, Renan, Lenormant, and others recognize the old Asiatic Meru. They hold that &quot; the sacred
expression /xepoTre? wOpwiroi originally meant the men sprung from Meru. &quot; l Stephanus has the same ren
dering in his &quot; Thesaurus.&quot;
In an advance chapter of his &quot; Origines de 1 His
toire,&quot; Lenormant expressed himself on this point as follows :
&quot; I have stated above, in agreement with M. Renan, that the sacred expression /^oTres, as used among the Greeks to designate mankind, could not have originally been applied to them on account of their possessing the gift of articulate
speech, as is pretended in the etymology of gram marians of late date, but as having proceeded from
Meru. Such an explanation, the consequence of which is to carry back this name of the sacred mountain, the abode of the gods and the birth-place of mankind, to the most ancient period of Aryan
unity, is corroborated, in a manner to my mind quite
decisive, by the existence of myths which make the Meropes to be a special and autochthonic popula tion, of a date far back in the most ancient times, who lead a life of innocence and happiness, marked
by extraordinary longevity (a feature in common with
the Indian legends concerning Uttara-Kuru), under the government of a king, Merops, who is sometimes represented as preserving them from the Deluge in
the same way as the Yima of the Iranians, and as sembling them around him to shelter them from the Flood, from which they alone escape. This myth is usually localized in the island of Kos, which re
ceives the name of Meropeis, Meropis, or Merope.
1 Lenormant, Origines, ii. i, p. 56.



1 84 PARADISE FOUND.
But the island of Siphnos is also reputed to have
been called Meropia in virtue of a similar tradition, and Strabo speaks of a fabulous region of the name
of Meropis, which was described by Theopompus, and which seems to have been placed near the coun
try of the Hyperboreans. Merops is also given as a king of the Ethiopians ; the most pious and most virtuous of men, the husband of Klymene the mother of Phaethon, and consequently anterior to the catas
trophe of the conflagration of the universe, by which the first human race, that of the Golden Age, is often said to have been destroyed. Or else the same
name is given to a prophet king of Rhyndakos, in
Mysia, who also receives the very significant appel lation of Makar, or Makareus, the happy. All this shows that the paradisaic myth of the Meropes
was not peculiar to the island of Kos, but was cur rent elsewhere in the Greek world, and had under gone more than one localization there.&quot; l
Plato s story of lost Atlantis, the island which the ocean-god Poseidon prepared for his son Atlas
to rule over, is a fascinating picture of the ante diluvian world. Whether originating in Egypt, as claimed by Plato, 2 or inherited as a part of the
legendary wealth of the Hellenes, it is of special interest to us in the present discussion ; and this for three reasons :
1 &quot;Ararat and Eden.&quot; The Contemporary Review, Sept., 1881, Am. ed., p. 44. Compare Bryant, Analysis of Ancient Mythology. Lon don, 1807 : vol. v., pp. 75-92.

First, we have elsewhere shown that in oldest Greek thought Atlas belongs at the North Pole, and it is only reasonable to locate the kingdom of Atlas
in the same locality.
Secondly, some authorities have unconsciously placed Atlantis in just this polar position by identi fying its inhabitants with the &quot;
Hyperboreans.&quot; l
Thirdly, Apollodorus and Theopompus expressly call the lost land Meropia, and its inhabitants Me
ropes ; i. e., according to the above authorities, &quot;is
sued from Meru.&quot; 2
The fabled country further resembles Eden in the
difficulties which scholarship of every kind has found in giving it a location in harmony with all the data. These difficulties are so great that some learned
writers have located it as far to the West as Amer ica, others as far to the East as in the Sea of Azof, or in Persia. Even of those who have sought a
place for it in the mid-Atlantic, some have pushed it up and some down, until one of the latest writers
says, &quot;All hypotheses are permissible.&quot; 3 His illus

&quot; It was a common practice with the Greeks to disguise their
own ignorance of the purport of a foreign word by supplying a word of a similar sound and inventing a story to agree with it : thus Meru, or the North Pole, the supposed abode of the Devatas, being consid ered as the birth-place of the god, gave rise to the fable that Bacchus s second birth was from the thigh of Jupiter, because Meros, a Greek word approaching Meru in sound, signifies thigh in that lan guage.&quot; J.

trious countryman, Monsieur J. S. Bailly, a century
ago, came nearer the truth, when, in view of the
perplexities attending all other locations, he cor rectly placed his lost Atlantis in the Paleo-Arctic Ocean. Again, the antediluvian world was, of course, in the vicinity of lost Eden. But it is to be observed that in Hellenic tradition Deukalion is not a Greek, but an inhabitant of a country in the high North, a Scythian. Moreover the Scythians, as we know from Justin, were considered a very much more an cient people than the Greeks ; indeed, as the very
oldest in the world. 1 Moreover, Scythia, like polar
Meru and Hara-berezaiti, was conceived of as a lofty region from which all the rivers of the earth de scend. 2 All of which obviously connects the ante

kind, without having, properly speaking, any mountains, is higher
than the rest of the earth in such a way as to be the starting-point of all the rivers, editiorem omnibus terris esse, ut cuncta flumina ibi nata&quot; Lenormant, The Contemporary Review^ Sept., 1881 (Am, cd.), p. 40.

Finally, in Greek tradition, the first men lived under the beneficent rule of Kronos, father of Zeus, enjoying the blessedness of the Golden Age. But it is clear from Strabo and others that the seat of Kronos kingdom was in the farthest North. 1 Men

CHAPTER I.
THE EDEN STARS.
E vidi stelle Non viste mai, for che alia prima gente. DANTE.
WE have already reminded the reader that in an Eden situated at the North Pole the stars, instead of seeming to rise and set as with us, would have had a horizontal motion from left to right round and round the observer. This appearance of the heav enly bodies could of course be found nowhere but at
the Pole. If, therefore, we could anywhere in the world of ancient tradition find any statement of a belief that at the beginning of the world the move ments of the heavenly bodies were different from
their present movements, and particularly if we should be able to find trace of a belief that the pri meval motion of the stars was in orbits apparently
horizontal, this would certainly be a most striking and cogent and unexpected evidence that human observation of the starry heavens began at the Pole.
Now it so happens that we have traces of just
such a belief. In the tantalizing fragments of an
cient lore, preserved to us in the pages of Diogenes
Laertius, we find ascribed to the illustrious Greek
astronomer Anaxagoras this remarkable teaching :
&quot;In the beginning the stars revolved in a tholiform
manner.&quot;



1 92 PARADISE FOUND.
Now to revolve in a tholiform manner is to re volve in a horizontal plane, like the 0o Aos, or &quot;
dome,&quot;
of an astronomical observatory. Anaxagoras him self denned the motion more fully when he said that
it was a motion, not vvro, underneath, but wept, around
the earth. 1 Anaximenes would seem to have had the same
idea, for he is reported to have likened the primitive
revolution of the sky to the rotating of a man s hat
upon his head. Another explanatory expression (whether originating with Anaxagoras or with his re
porter we do not know) is this: &quot;At first the Pole
star, which is continually visible, always appeared in the zenith, but afterward it acquired a certain decli
nation.&quot; 2
Here, then, we have as a doctrine of the ancient astronomers the singular notion that, in the begin ning of the world, the celestial Pole was in the ze

&quot;
father,&quot; of our present sun and moon is represented as beginning his activities in the new-created world by repeatedly performing in a horizontal plane a circumambulation of the &quot; Island of the Congealed Drop ;

nith, and that the revolutions of the stars were round a perpendicular axis. 1 What could have led an as tronomer to invent such a doctrine it is impossible to say. On the other hand, if it was one of the
interesting and seemingly paradoxical traditions of the early postdiluvian world, it is perfectly easy to see how imperishable a story it would be, particu
larly among the star-loving Chaldaeans and Babyloni
ans, from whom the earliest Greek astronomers and scientists received no small share of their doctrines. 2 And that the Chaldseans and probably the Egyp tians had precisely this idea is not a notion here advanced for the first time. 3
Another interesting question now suggests itself. When and under what circumstances was this al
leged &quot;declination&quot; of the Pole imagined to have
taken place ? Was it gradual, or sudden ? Did the ancients suppose it to have resulted from a move ment in the regular order of nature, or from one in

violation thereof ? Was it to them a normal and ever on-going change, or was it the record of a nat
ural catastrophe ? Our hypothesis would lead us to expect the latter of these suppositions. 1 The only rational and cred ible explanation of the declination is to be found in a transfer of the theatre of human history from the
circumpolar home to some land of lower latitude.
Now if, during the prevalence of the Deluge, or later, in consequence of the on-coming of the Ice age, the survivors of the Flood were translocated from their antediluvian home at the Pole to the
north slope of the &quot;
plateau of Pamir,&quot; the prob
able starting-point of historic postdiluvian human ity, the new aspect presented by the heavens in this
new latitude would have been precisely as if in the grand world-convulsion the sky itself had become
displaced, its polar dome tilted over about one third of the distance from the zenith to the horizon. The astronomical knowledge of those survivors very likely enabled them to understand the true reason of the changed appearance, but their rude descend ants, unfavored with the treasures of antediluvian
science, and born only to a savage or nomadic life
in their new and inhospitable home, might easily have forgotten the explanation. In time such chil dren s children might easily have come to embody the strange story handed down from their fathers
in strange myths, in which nothing of the original facts remained beyond an obscure account of some
mysterious displacement of the sky, supposed to have

THE EDEN STARS. 195
occurred in a far-off age in connection with some
appalling natural cataclysm or world-disaster. 1
Now it is difficult to believe it a mere accident that in various ancient authors we find allusion both
to an extremely ancient displacement of the sky and
to its supposed original state. None of these allu
sions have ever been explained by writers on the subject. One of them occurs in Plato s Timaeus,
where, in language ascribed to an Egyptian priest of Solon s time, &quot; a declination of the bodies revolving round the earth&quot; is spoken of, and this declination is
offered as the true explanation of the partial destruc tion of the world commemorated in the myth of Phaethon. As this destruction was by fire there would at first sight seem to be no connection be tween it and the destruction at the time of the
Deluge ; nor is there in the context anything to sug
gest such a connection. Fortunately, however, we have in Hyginus a fuller version of the myth, from which it appears that the Greeks supposed Deukalion s universal flood to have been providentially sent
to extinguish the fearful conflagration which Phaethon s unskillful driving of the steeds of the sun had
1 The only other plausible explanation of the facts now under con
sideration would be that furnished by the long ago proposed but em
phatically rejected theory, that in some distant geological age in con sequence of some cataclysm the axis of the earth s rotation was changed, bringing the new or present Pole into a region before tem perate or torrid. C. F. Winslow, M. D., in his pamphlet on The Cooling Globe, Boston, 1865, was one of the most recent theorists to favor this view. But see Maedler, Populdre Astronomie, p. 370 ss.,
who states that, according to the calculations of Bessel, the bodily plucking up of one hundred and fourteen cubic miles of the Himalaya mountains and the transfer of them to North America would change the position of the earth s axis less than one hundred feet. Still stronger statements are made in the paper read before the London
Geological Society, Feb. 21, 1877, by Professor J. F. Twisden.

occasioned. This makes the connection clear and direct. The Flood and the &quot; declination of the heavenly bodies revolving round the earth &quot; are at once brought into a true historic relation. 1
In like manner, in the Bundahish, in the first five
chapters, and in Zad Sparam s paraphrase of the same, it is stated that during the first three thousand
years, before the incoming of the Evil One, &quot; the sun, moon, and stars stood still,&quot; but as soon as the Destroyer of the good creation came he assaulted and deranged the sky, as well as the earth and sea.2
And remarkably enough, it is stated that as a result of this assault the Evil One mastered as much as
&quot; one third of the sky &quot;and overspread it with dark
ness. 3 Moreover, in the thirtieth chapter, in giv
ing a prophetic account of the final restoration of the material world to its primeval state, there seems
to be an allusion in verse thirty-two to a necessary
resetting or readjustment of the celestial vault by the hand of its Creator. 4 To all such facts, wherever found, we have in the hypothesis of an Arctic Eden and a transfer of the human horizon at the time of the Deluge to lower
latitudes a perfect key.

CHAPTER II.
THE EDEN DAY.
Such day
As heaven! s great year brings forth. MILTON.
To the first men, if the Garden of Eden was lo cated at the Pole, there could have been but one day
and one night in a year. Moreover, at the break of that strange day the sun must have risen, not in
the East, as in postdiluvian times, but in the South.
Do the traditions or sacred books of the ancient world afford any hint of such a sunrise and of such
an Eden day ?
A
partial answer to this question is found in the
beliefs of the ancient Northmen. A learned Danish writer pronounces it &quot; remarkable &quot; that the Scandi navian mythology informs us that, before the estab lishment of the present order of the world, the sun,
which now rises in the East, &quot;rose in the South&quot; 1
Equally striking confirmations appear in other mythologies. Turning to the second Fargard of the
Avesta, we find the most ancient Iranian account of
Yima, the first man and &quot;the King of the Golden
Age.&quot; A detailed account is also given of a certain

Vara, or inclosure, which as a safe habitation a kind of Garden of Eden he was divinely com
manded to make. Then comes this singular ques tion and answer :
&quot; O Maker of the material world,
thou Holy One ! What lights are there in the Vara
which Yima made ?
&quot;
&quot;Ahura Mazda answered: There are uncreated lights and created lights. There the stars, the moon, and the sun are only once a year seen to rise
and set, and a year seems only as a day.&quot;
1 Haug s
version of the last clause is,
&quot; And they think that a

ration. &quot;The really genuine words,&quot; he observes, &quot; are very difficult.&quot; They are not so when once the key is found.
That the East Aryans had the same idea is also
evident from the Laws of Manu. Among this peo
ple Yama the same as the Iranian Yima was the first man. His first abode, as we have seen, was at the North Pole, and at death he became a god, the guardian of the South Pole, at which was the region of the dead. But though the Hindus no longer associated him with the North at the time of the writing of this ancient book, they well under
stood that Yama s primitive Eden in Ilavrita, around the north polar Meru, where the gods reside, has only one day and one night in the year. This is the language of the Code :

and a night of the gods, or regents of the universe seated around the North Pole ; and again their divis ion is this : their day is the northern and their night the southern course of the sun.&quot; 1
In like manner, in the Surya Siddhanta we read,
&quot; The gods behold the sun, after it is once arisen,
for half a year.&quot;
2
Equally unmistakable is the language of the prob ably more ancient work, lately translated under the title of &quot; The Institutes of Vishnu :
&quot;
&quot; The northern progress of the sun is a day with
the gods. &quot; The southern progress of the sun is (with them)
a night.
&quot; A year is (with them) a day and a night.&quot;

1 Code of Manual. 67. 2 Chapter xii., 74. 3 The Institutes of Vishnu, translated by Julius Jolly. Ch. xx., I, 2, 3. Sacred Books of the East, vol. vii., p. 77. I cannot help think ing that in these alternate approaches and recessions of the sun we have the true explanation of the origin of the old Rabbinical idea of half-yearly cold and heat in hell, this latter being located, as we have shown, at the South Pole :
&quot; The great Jalkut Rubeni gives us the following account of hell : Sheol is half fire and half hail, and therein are many rivers of fire. The seven abodes (or divisions) of hell are very spacious ; and in each there are seven rivers of fire and seven rivers of hail. The uppermost abode is sixty times less than the second, and thus the second is sixty times larger than the
first, and every abode is sixty times larger than that which precedes it. In each abode are seven thousand caverns, and in each cavern seven thousand clefts, and in each cleft seven thousand scorpions ; and each scorpion hath seven limbs, and on each limb are one thou sand barrels of gall. There are likewise seven rivers of rankest poison, which when a man toucheth he bursteth ; and the destroying
angels judge him and scourge him every moment, half a year in the
fire and half a year in the hail and snow. And the cold is more in tolerable than the fire.&quot; Eisenmenger, Entdecktes Judenthum, vol.
:i., p. 345 (English translation, vol. ii., p. 52). According to the Sur ya Siddanta, the demons as well as the gods behold the sun for six months at a time.



2OO PARADISE FOUND.
This strange notion is perfectly clear and compre
hensible the moment we assume that the long-lived fathers and first regents of the human race originally
dwelt at the North Pole, and that these, apotheosized
and glorified in the imagination of later generations, in time became the gods which ancient nations wor
shiped. Both in the Iliad and Odyssey the learned Anton Krichenbauer finds two kinds of days continually re ferred to. In what he considers the more ancient
portions of the poems, the day is a period of one
year s duration, especially when used in describing the life and exploits of the gods ; in what he con siders the more modern portions, the term has its
modern meaning as a period of twenty-four hours.
He quotes Lepsius as recognizing a similar &quot;oneday year&quot; in the Egyptian and other ancient chro nologies ; also the mention made of it by Palaifatos and Suidas. 1 In all such hitherto unnoticed testimonies and we have not exhausted the list of them 2 we have
new and singularly unimpeachable evidences that in the thought of these ancient peoples the land in
which the generated gods and men alike originated was a land in which, as in our Polar Eden, a day and
a night filled out the year. And if such was their

idea, whence, save from actual tradition, could they
have derived it ? As cautious a scientific authority
as Sir Charles Lyell, speaking of these cosmological and chronological traditions of the Hindus, says :
&quot; We can by no means look upon them as a pure effort of the unassisted imagination, or believe them
to have been composed without regard to opinions and theories founded on the observation of Nature! 1 Even where the tradition has become distorted or
inverted among barbarians, the parallelism of the
year and the day is not always lost. A curious in stance of this has come under the notice of the
writer since the present chapter was begun :
&quot; In
those days (in the world before the present) the sea
sons were much shorter than they are now. A year then was but as a day of our time.&quot; 2

To the first men, on the hypothesis of an Arctic Eden, the zenith and the north pole of the heavens
were identical. Such an aspect of the starry vault the humanity of our late historic ages has never
seen. Under such an adjustment of the rotating
firmament, how regular and orderly would nature appear ! What profound significance would of ne cessity attach to that mysterious unmoving centre
point of cosmic revolution directly overhead ! As intimated on page 50, that polar centre must nat urally have seemed to be the top of the world, the
true heaven, the changeless seat of the supreme God
or gods. &quot; And if, through all the long life-time of
the antediluvian world, this circumpolar sky was thus to human thought the true abode of God, the

oldest postdiluvian peoples, though scattered down the sides of the globe half or two thirds the distance
to the equator, could not easily forget that at the centre and true top of the firmament was the throne
and the palace of its great Creator.&quot;
The religions of all ancient nations signally con firm and satisfy this antecedent expectation. With a marvelous unanimity they associate the abode of the
supreme God with the North Pole, &quot; the centre of heaven or with the celestial space immediately sur
rounding it. No writer on Comparative Theology has ever brought out the facts which establish this
assertion, but the following outline of them will
suffice for our present purpose : First. The Hebrew Conception. In so pure and lofty a monotheism as that of the ancient Hebrews, we must not expect to find any such strict localiza
tion of the supreme God in the circumpolar sky as we shall find among polytheistic peoples.
&quot; Do I
not fill heaven and earth ?
&quot;
is the language of Jeho vah. Nevertheless, as the Hebrews must be sup posed to have shared, in some measure, the geo
graphical and cosmological ideas of their age, it would not be strange if in their sacred writings traces of these ideas were here and there discernible. Some of these traces are quite curious, and they have attracted the attention of not a few Biblical scholars, to whom their origin and rationale are en
tirely unsuspected. Thus a learned writer on He
brew geography, after blindly repeating the common assumption that &quot;the Hebrews conceived the sur face of the earth to be an immense disk, supported, like the flat roof of an Eastern house, by pillars,&quot; yet uses such language as this :
&quot; The North ap

pears to have been regarded as the highest part of the earth s surface, in consequence, perhaps, of the mountain ranges which existed there.&quot; 1
Another, touching upon the same subject, says, &quot; The Hebrews regarded what lay to the North as higher, and what lay to the South as lower: hence they who traveled from South to North were said
to go up/ while they who went from North to South were said to go down. &quot; 2
In Psalm seventy-fifth, verse sixth, we read, &quot; Pro motion cometh not from the East, nor from the West, nor from the South.&quot; Why this singular enumera
tion of three of the points of the compass, and this omission of the fourth? Simply because heaven, the proper abode of the supreme God, being con ceived of by all the surrounding nations, if not by the Hebrews themselves, as in the North, in the circumpolar sky, that was the sacred quarter, and it could not reverently be said that promotion cometh not from the North.3 It would have been as offen sive as among us to say that promotion cometh not
from above. Therefore, having completed his neg ative statements, the Psalmist immediately adds,
&quot;But God is the judge; He putteth down one, and
setteth up another.&quot;
A curious trace of the same conception appears in the book of Job, in the eighth and ninth verses

of the twenty -third chapter. In Old Testament times, the Hebrews and the Arabians designated
the cardinal points by the personal terms, &quot; before &quot;
for East, &quot;behind&quot; for West, &quot;left/hand
&quot; for North,
and &quot;
right hand &quot; for South. Thus Job, in the pas
sage indicated, is complaining that he can nowhere, East or West, North or South, find his divine judge. 1 But, in speaking of one of these points, he adds this
singular qualification, &quot;where God doth work&quot; This is said of the left hand, or North. It seems to be inserted to render peculiarly emphatic the declara
tion, &quot;I go . . . [even] to the left hand where He doth
work, but I cannot behold Him.&quot; If at first blush
such an apparent localizing of the divine agency seems inconsistent with Job s splendid descriptions of God s omnipresence in other passages, it should be remembered that we, too, speak of the omni
present deity as dwelling &quot; on high,&quot; and address
Him as &quot; Our Father which art in Heaven.&quot;
A natural counterpart to this idea of a northern
heaven would be a belief or impression that spiritual perils and evils were in a peculiar degree or manner
to be apprehended from the right hand, or South, as the proper abode of demons, the quarter to which Asmodeus fled when exorcised by the angel. 2
We cannot positively affirm that such a belief con

sciously prevailed among the ancient Hebrews, but,
holding the possibility in mind, we find passages of Scripture which seem to stand out in a new and striking light. Thus, in case there was such a be
lief, how great the force and beauty of the expres
sion, &quot; Because [the Lord] is at my right hand [the side exposed to danger] I shall not be moved.&quot; 1
With this may be compared the confident expres sions of the one hundred and twenty-first Psalm :
&quot; The Lord is thy keeper : the Lord is thy shade upon
thy right hand.&quot; So also in the ninety-first it is on
the right hand that destruction is anticipated :
&quot; A
thousand shall fall at thy side, and [or even] ten thousand at thy right hand ; but it shall not come
nigh thee.&quot; Again, in the one hundred and forty
second it is said,
&quot; I looked on my right hand, but
there was no man that would know me : refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.&quot; Notice also the
imprecation,
&quot; Let Satan stand at his right hand &quot; (Ps. cix. 6), and the vision of Zechariah, where the
great adversary makes his appearance on the right
of the one whom he came to resist (Zech. iii. i). But as Satan here reveals himself from beneath and from the South, so to Ezekiel the true God re veals himself from above and from the North (Eze. i. 4). In that quarter was God s holy mountain (Is. xiv. 13), the city of the Great King (Ps. xlviii. 2),
the land of gold (Job xxxvii. 22, marg.), the place where divine power had hung the earth upon noth
ing (Job xxvi. ;).2 Hence the priest officiating at
1 Ps. xvi. 8. The reference seems all the more unmistakable since the next two verses speak of Sheol, or Hades. 2

See also p. 177 of this volume. 2 At first view it seems strange that in the Middle Ages, in Chris tian Europe, the North should have come to be regarded as the special abode of Satan and his subjects, and that on the north side of some churches, near the baptismal font, there should have been a &quot; Devil s Door,&quot; which was opened to let the evil spirit pass to his own place at the time of the renunciation of him by the person baptized. The simple explanation of this is found in the fact that the people were
taught that their old gods, whom they had worshiped when pagans, were devils. Compare Grimm, Deutsche Mythologie, p. 30,31. Con
way, in his Demonology and Devil Lore (London, 1879 : vol. ii., 115 ;
i., 87), entirely misconceives the philosophy of the fact. A similar change seems to have occurred among the Iranians after Mazdeism

Second. The Egyptian Conception. The corre
spondence of the ancient Egyptian conception of the world and of heaven with the foregoing would be remarkable did we not know that Egypt was
the cradle of the Hebrew people. The ancient in habitants of the Nile valley had the same idea as to
the direction of the true summit of the earth. To them, as to the Hebrews, it was in the North. This was the more remarkable since it was exactly con trary to all the natural indications of their own country, which continually ascended toward the
South. As stated in a previous chapter, Brugsch
says,
&quot; The Egyptians conceived of the earth as ris ing toward the North, so that in its northernmost
point it at last joined the sky! * In correspondence herewith the Egyptians located their Ta-nuter, or
&quot; land of the gods,&quot; in the extreme North. 2 On this account it is on the northern exterior wall of the
great temple of Ammon at Karnac that the divinity promises to King Rameses II. the products of that
heavenly country,
&quot;
silver, gold, lapis-lazuli, and all the varieties of precious stones of the land of the
gods.&quot; Hence, also, contrary to all natural indica tions, the northern hemisphere was considered the realm of light, the southern the realm of darkness.3

Hence, while in portions of the Avestan literature (generally the older) the heaven of Ahura Mazda is in the North, in other portions the North is the world of death and demons.

terpretation is correct, such passages from the burial chamber toward the polar heaven intimated a vital faith that from the chamber of death to the highest
abode of life, imperishable and divine, the road is
straight and ever open. 1 Third. The Conception of the Akkadians, Assyri ans, Babylonians, Indians, and Iranians. After what has been said in former chapters respecting the location of Kharsak Kurra, Sad Matati, HarMoed, Su-Meru, and Hara-berezaiti, no further proof is needed that all the peoples above named associ ated the true heaven, the abode of the highest gods,
the stars dispersed in infinite number through all the ethereal space,
and divided into four principal groups according to the four quarters of the world. They were then divided into two orders more elevated, the one filling the northern hemisphere and belonging to light, to the good principle, the other to the southern hemisphere, dark, co\d,funeste, and to the sombre abodes of Amenti.&quot; Guigniaut s Creuzer,
Religions de FAntiquite, vol. ii., p. 836. A very curious survival of the
above conception is found in the Talmudic Emek Hammeleck. See Eisenmenger, Entdecktes Judenthum, Stehelin s version, vol. i., p. 181 ; comp. p. 255 ff. 1 The association of Set with the constellation of the Great Bear, reported by Plutarch and lately confirmed by original astronomical texts (Brugsch, Astronomische Inschriften alttrgyptiscker Denkmaler,
Leipsic, 1883, pp. 82-84, I 2I - I2 3)&amp;gt; seems at first view inconsistent with the south polar location of demons and destructive divinities. But the apparent difficulty is transformed into an all the stronger proof of the correctness of our theory when it is remembered that in the most ancient times Set &quot; was not a god of evil,&quot; but the supreme
world-sovereign from whom the Egyptian kings derived their author
ity over the two hemispheres. &quot; It was not till the decline of the Em14

with the northern celestial pole. 1 In each case the
apex of their respective mounts of the gods pierced
the sky precisely at that point. To this day the Haranite Sabaeans the most direct heirs of the
religious traditions of the Tigro-Euphratean world construct their temples with careful reference to
the ancient faith. 2 Their priests also, in the act
of sacrifice, like all ancient priesthoods, face the North. 3
In the Rig Veda, ii., 40, I, we read of the amf
tasya nfibhim, &quot;the Navel of the Heavens.&quot; The
same or similar expressions occur again and again in the Vedic literature. They refer to the northern
celestial Pole, just as the expression ndbhir prthivyds,
&quot; Navel of the Earth,&quot; R. V. iii., 29, 4, and elsewhere, signifies the northern terrestrial Pole. To each is
ascribed preeminent sanctity. The one is the holi
pire that this deity came to be regarded as an evil demon, that his
name was effaced from the monuments, and other names substituted for his in the Ritual.&quot; Renouf, Religion ofAncient Egypt, pp. 119, 120.
The expression navel or centre of heaven, as a designation for the
northern celestial Pole, so common among ancient nations, would
seem to have been current among the Egyptians also. Brugsch, Ibid., p. 122, 123. In the text as translated, however, there is some,
obscurity. Compare p. 154. 1

est shrine in heaven, the other the holiest shrine on earth. That no translator has hitherto caught the true meaning of the terms seems unaccountable. 1 In Buddhism, the heir and conservator of so many of the ancient ideas of India, the same notion of a world ruler with his throne at the celestial Pole
lived on.2 Very curiously, if we follow the author
ity of the Lalitavistara, the first actions and words ascribed to the infant Buddha on his arrival in our
world unmistakably identify the North with the abode of the gods, and its nadir with the abode of the demons. 3 Even the modern relics of the non
Aryan aboriginal tribes of India, as for example the Gonds, have retained this ancient ecumenical ethnic
belief. 4
1 In his heading to Hymn I., 185, 5, Grassman parenthetically con
jectures that the Navel of the World therein spoken of may be &quot; im Osten&quot; but suggests no reason for its location in that or any other quarter. Not by accident, however, did the ancient bard elsewhere
(X., 82, 2) place the abode of God &quot;beyond the Seven Rishis,&quot; in the
highest North. 2

Fourth. The Phoenician, Greek, Etruscan, and
Roman Conception. That the Phoenicians shared the general Asiatic view of a mountain of the gods
in the extreme North appears from Movers learned
work upon that people. 1 The evidence that in ancient Hellenic thought, also, the heaven of the gods was in the northern
sky is incidental, but cumulative and satisfactory.
For example, heaven is upheld by Atlas, but the ter
restrial station of Atlas, as we have elsewhere shown, is at the North Pole. Again, Olympos was the
abode of the gods ; but if the now generally current
etymology of this term is correct, Olympos was sim
ply the Atlantean pillar, pictured as a lofty moun tain, and supporting the sky at its northern Pole.2
In fact, many writers now affirm that the Olympos
of Greek mythology was originally simply the north polar &quot; World-mountain &quot; of the Asiatic nations.3
North, as the home of their gods is supposed to be in the latter direction. They call the North Deoguhr sometimes, and the South, Muraho, is
looked upon as a region of terror ; so the feet are laid towards Deo
guhr in order that they may carry the dead man in the right direc
tion.&quot; Report of Ethnological Committee, quoted in Spencer s De scriptive Sociology, Div. I., Ft. 3, A., p. 36. 1 Die Phbnizier. Bonn, 1841-56, vol. i., pp. 261, 414.
2
&quot; Here the idea is that the gods reside above this mountain [Su
Meru], which is, as it were, the support of their dwellings. This brings to our mind the fable of Atlas supporting the heavens ; the same idea may probably be traced in the Greek Olympos (Sanskrit,
dlamba, a support ).&quot; Samuel Beal, Four Lectures on Buddhist Lit erature in China. London, 1882 : p. 147. Compare Grill. 3 Compare A. H. Sayce, Transactions of Society Bib. Archeology, vol. iii., 152. Even in the mathematical cosmos of Philolaos, though the sedes deorum seems to be placed in Hestia, at the centre of the
system, there is yet a steep way leading perpendicularly to the polar summit of the heavens, by means of which the gods and holy souls attain the diviner realm of all perfection :
&quot; Dii vero, quando ad convivium pergunt, turn quidem acclivi via proficiscuntur sub summura

In prayer the Greeks turned towards the North,
and from Homer we know that when they addressed
the &quot; Olympian
&quot;
gods they stretched out their hands &quot; toward the starry heavens ;
&quot; Greek prayers, there fore, must have been addressed toward the northern
heavens. Entirely confirmatory of this is the ac count Plato gives of &quot; the holy habitation of Zeus,&quot; in which the solemn convocations of the gods were
held, and which, he explains,
&quot; was placed in the
Centre of the World.&quot; l
That this Centre is the northern celestial Pole is
placed beyond question by a well-known passage from Servius Maurus, 2 where it is called the &quot; domicilium Jovis&quot; and where we are informed that the Etruscan and Roman augurs considered thunder and
lightning in the northern sky more significant than in any other quarter, being &quot; higher and nearer to the abode of Jove? 3 Countries in high northern latitudes shared in this peculiar sanctity.

Beauvois, &quot; the Romans regarded Great Britain as nearer heaven and more sacred than the Mediterra nean countries.&quot; l Varro and other Latin writers
confirm this general representation, so that all mod ern expounders of the old Etruscan religion unite in locating the abode of the gods of Etruria in the
Centre of Heaven, the northern circumpolar sky. 2 Niebuhr and other authorities of the highest rank assure us that the Romans shared the same faith. 3

Fifth. The Japanese Conception. We have al ready seen that in the Japanese cosmogony the down-thrust spear of Izanagi becomes the upright axis of heaven and earth. Izanagi s place, there fore, at the upper end of this axis can be nowhere else than at the North Pole of the sky. 1 But we are not left to inference. So inseparably was the Creator associated with the Pole in ancient
Japanese thought that one of his loftiest and divin
est titles was derived from this association. Writ
ing of the primitive ideas of this people, one of our best authorities uses the following language :
&quot; I
shall do the Ko-ji-ki, and the Shinto religion, and
the Japanese philosophy, strict justice by saying that, according to them, there existed in the begin ning one god, and nobody and nothing besides.
&quot; Far in the deep infinitudes of space, Upon a throne of silence,
sat the god Ame-no-mi-naka-nushi-no-kami, whose
name signifies THE LORD OF THE CENTRE OF
HEAVEN.&quot; 2
What this Centre of Heaven is cannot well be doubtful to any careful reader of the present chapter. Sixth. The Chinese Conception. The oldest traceable worship among the Chinese is that of
Shang-te, the highest of all gods. It is believed to have existed more than two thousand years before
Christ. Shang-te is usually and correctly described

the Roman in prayer. Prolegomena zur Geschichte Roms. Oraculum, Auspicium Templum, Regnum. Leipsic, 1882 : p. 15. 1 See above, pt. iv., ch. 2. 2 Sir Edward J. Reed, Japan, vol. i., p. 27. Compare Leon de Rosny, in Revue de PHistoire des Religions. Paris 1884 : p. 208 ; also p. 211.

as the god of heaven. But his proper place of
abode, his palace, is called Tsze-wei. And if we in
quire as to the meaning and location of Tsze-wei, the native commentators upon the sacred books in form us that it is &quot; a celestial space about the North
Pole.&quot; i
Here, as in Japan, and in Egypt, and in India, and in Iran, and in Greece, the Pole is &quot; the centre &quot; of
the sky. A writer in the &quot; Chinese Repository
&quot;
quotes from authoritative religious books these dec larations: &quot;The Polar star is the Centre of Heaven.&quot;
&quot; Shang-te s throne is in Tsze-wei, i. e., the Polar
star.&quot;
&quot; Immediately over the central peak of Kwen-lun appears the Polar star, which is Shang
te s heavenly abode.&quot; &quot;In the central place the
Polar star of Heaven, the one Bright One, the
Great Monad, always dwells.&quot; 2 In accordance with this conception, the Emperor and his assistants, when officiating before the Altar of Heaven, always face the North. 3 The Pole-star
itself is a prominent object of worship. 4 And how prevalent this localization of the abode of God at

and Tauism, London, 1879, P- 2 ?8- From these and other references it is plain that Confucians and Tauists alike identified the northern sky with the abode of God. 2 Vol. iv., p. 194.

the Pole remains after four thousand years may be illustrated by the following incident narrated by Rev. Dr. Edkins :
&quot; I met on one occasion a school
master from the neighborhood of Chapoo. He asked if I had any books to give away on astronomy and geography. Such books are eagerly desired by
all members of the literary class. . . . The inquiry
was put to him Who is the Lord of heaven and
earth ? He replied that he knew none but the Pole
star, called in the Chinese language Teen-hwang-tate, the Great Imperial Ruler of Heaven.&quot; 1
Seventh. The Ancient German and the Finnic Con
ception. Like the ancients, when praying and sac rificing to the gods, the pagan Germans turned their faces toward the North.2 There, in the northern
heaven, at the top of Yggdrasil, the world-axis, stood the fair city of Asgard, the home of the Asen. The Eddas expressly say of it that it was built &quot; in the Centre of the World.&quot; 3 At that point, whence alone

3 Grimm, &quot; Im Mittelpunkte der Welt.&quot; Deutsche Mythologie, p. 778. The following is from the Prose Edda :
&quot; Then the sons of Bor built in the middle of the universe the city called Asgard, where dwell the gods and their kindred, and from that abode work out so many wondrous things both on the earth and in the heavens above it. There is in that city a place called Hlidskjalf, and when Odin is seated there upon his lofty throne he sees over the whole world, dis cerns all the actions of men, and comprehends whatever he contem plates. His wife is Frigga, the daughter of Fjorgyn, and they and
their offspring form the race that we call the ^sir, a race that dwells in Asgard the old, and in the regions around it, and that we know to be entirely divine.&quot; Mallet, Northern Antiquities, p. 406. The ex pression, &quot; from that abode work out so many wondrous things,&quot; re
calls to mind Job s description of the North as the place &quot; where God doth work.1



2l8 PARADISE FOUND.
the whole world of men is ever visible by night and
by day, stood Hlidskjalf, the watch-tower of Odin.
From this &quot; partie septentrionale du del&quot; he and
Frigga, like the great gods of the Etruscans, &quot; veillatent sur toute la terre.&quot; 1 Among the ancient Finns the name of the su
preme god was Ukko. In their mythology he is
sometimes represented as upbearing the firmament, like Atlas, and sometimes he is called Taivahan Na
panen, &quot;the Navel of Heaven.&quot; As Castren shows,
this curious title is given him simply because he re sides in the centre or Pole of heaven.2 In the great
epic of this people, the Kalevala, the abode of the
supreme God is called Tahtela, 8 which word simply means &quot; Place of TdJiti : Esthonian, Taht, the Polar
star.&quot;
We have not exhausted our materials in hand for the illustration of this point, 4 but surely we have
presented enough. Reviewing this singular una nimity of the ancient nations, no thoughtful reader
can fail to be impressed with its significance. No other explanation of it can be so simple and obvious as the supposition that the heaven which over arched the cradle of humanity was a heaven whose zenith was the northern Pole.
Before concluding the present chapter, another point of considerable interest should be noticed. In reading the Edenic traditions of the ancient nations

THE EDEN ZENITH.
as given in Part fourth, the question may well have
suggested itself to the reader, &quot; How is it that, with
such perfect unanimity on the part of contemporary nations in respect to the north-polar position of the cradle of mankind, the traditions of the Hebrews
alone should have placed it in the East ?
&quot; In the
facts just now reviewed we have a key to this puz
zle. The only word in Genesis which connects Eden
with the East is Kedem (Qedem). This term &quot; prop
erly means that which is before or in front of a per son, and was applied to the East from the custom of
turning in that direction when describing the points
of the compass.&quot;
1 From Gen. xiii. 14, it would seem to have acquired this association with the East
as early as the days of Abraham, but according tc
&quot;the custom&quot; of a particular time or people it could
mean one point of the compass as well as another.
It was simply the &quot;front-country.&quot; In late historic times among the Hebrews it was the East, and ac
cordingly the West was the country &quot;
behind,&quot; the
North the &quot;left hand,&quot; the South the &quot;right,&quot; as
before noticed. In Egypt, however, the usage was
different, the &quot; front - country
&quot;
being either the North or the South, which we cannot certainly
tell, as Egyptologists are divided on the question. Pierret thinks that it was South, and that accord ingly the right hand was West and the left East.2
Chabas and others, however, exactly reverse the
meaning of the hieroglyphics translated &quot;right&quot; and
&quot;
left,&quot; and hold that in designating the points of
the compass the ancient Egyptian faced the North.

22O PARADISE FOUND.
Among the Akkadians and Assyrians, if we may rely upon a questionable statement of Lenormant, still another adjustment prevailed : the right hand was the North, the left the South, and the &quot;front&quot; direc
tion, of course, the West.1 In view of these facts it is plain that, anterior to
the fixation of Hebrew usage, that is in pre-Abra
hamic times, Qedem, or the &quot;front-country,&quot; may as
well have meant the North as any other quarter.
And there is much reason to suppose that it did
have this meaning. We have seen that this was pe culiarly the sacred quarter of the whole Asiatic and
Egyptian world. Toward it faced all earliest priest
hoods and worshipers of whom we have any knowl
edge.2 What so natural as that they should con
template and designate the different quarters of the world from the standpoint of their normal posture
in worship ? And if once we assume that such was the usage of all the Noachidae anterior to their dis
persion, and that accordingly &quot;the front -country
&quot;
meant the North, all at once becomes plain. Gen esis then unites with universal ethnic tradition in locating the cradle of mankind in the North. The
record then reads, &quot;And the Lord God planted a
garden in the North country, in Eden.&quot; And, in
precise agreement herewith, it is down from the mountainous heights of this North country &quot;from
1 Fragments de Berose, p. 367 ; also, 380, 419. But compare Ckaldaan Mag?c, pp. 168, 169, where, by identifying the West with the point &quot; behind the observer,&quot; he directly contradicts the account given in his Commentary on Berosus. The paragraph does not appear in the original French edition of the work. 2 Even among the aborigines of America and Africa we are told that &quot; the West is the left hand and the East the right.&quot; Massey, The Natural Genesis, vol. ii., p. 231.



THE EDEN ZENITH. 221
Qedem &quot; that the descendants of Noah in after
time come into &quot; the plain in the land of Shinar &quot;
(Gen. xi. 2). So is cleared up simultaneously an other mystery, for how to bring the first colonizers
of Shinar into the Tigro-Euphrates valley, from any probable Ararat by any probable &quot; journeying from
the East&quot; or, as the margin gives it, &quot;eastwards&quot;
has always perplexed the commentator. 1 This interpretation harmonizes for the first time
Gen. ii. 8 with Eze. xxviii. 13, both now referring to one and the same point of the compass, the sacred North. Again, the well-known difficulty of harmo nizing the references to &quot; the children of Qedem,&quot; found in the oldest of the Hebrew Scriptures, such as Gen. xxix. I, and Job i. 3, is solved at once by
this interpretation. At the same time it gives us a
location for &quot;the land of Uz&quot; exactly correspond
ing with the explicit declaration of Josephus :
&quot; Uz
founded Trachonitis and Damascus ; this country
lies between Palestine and Coelosyria.&quot;
2
To most readers, this solution of the problem of the exceptional character of the Hebrew tradition
will probably at once commend itself as eminently
satisfactory. To some, however, it may seem a little difficult of belief that one and the same term could
in successive ages have found application to differ
ent points of the compass. 3 To such the following,
1 Of course, this interpretation proceeds upon the common assump tion that Miqqedem is translocative in signification, and that the land of Shinar was in the Tigro-Euphrates basin. In another note I have indicated the possibility that the land of Shinar was in primeval Qe dem, in which case Miqqedem in Gen. xi. 2 should be translated pre
cisely as in Gen. ii. 8,
&quot; in the North country.&quot;

written, of course, with no reference to our problem, will be of special interest :
&quot; The names of the four
cardinal points, and, what is very remarkable, the
hieroglyphic signs by which they are expressed, are in a certain measure the same in the Akkadian and Chinese cultures. This I intend to show in a spe
cial monograph upon the subject; but that which is here of importance to note is the displacement of the geographical horizon produced in the establish
ing of the hundred families. The South, which was so termed on the cuneiform tablets, corresponds in Chinese to the East, the North to the West, the
East to the South, making thus a displacement of
quarter of a circle. It would be interesting if, on
examination of the Akkadian and Assyrian names, we could find that they in their turn denoted an
early displacement of which only these traces re
main to us.&quot; 1
p. 99. Comp. p. 101, bot. Mr. G. Massey, in his vast astrotypological medley, refers to the horizon-displacement, but affords no intelli
gible explanation. He says,
&quot; In making the change to a circle of
twelve signs, the point of commencement in the North was e slewed round eastward. Hence the Akkadian Mountain of the World be came the Mountain of the East. Mount Meru, the primordial birth place in the North, likewise became the Mountain eastward. This
may be followed in the Adamah of the Genesis ; and in the Book of
Enoch it says, The fourth wind, which is named the North, is divided into three parts, and the third part contains Paradise. Thus Eden, which began at the summit of the Mount, and descended into the
Circle of Four Quarters prepared by Yima, in the Avesta, against the coming Deluge, was finally planted in the twelfth division of the zodiac of twelve signs, as the garden eastward.&quot; The Natural Gen

us to put our solution in yet simpler form. If we
may accept the teachings of the learned Maspero, the Egyptians often reduced the four quarters or di rections to two, using the term East in a sense suffi ciently broad to include both East and North, and the term West in a sense sufficiently broad to in clude both West and South. 1 If, then, Moses, who in his education was an Egyptian, wrote in accord
dinal Points in Chaldaea and China,&quot; which will appear in his forth coming work on The Origin of Chinese Civilization. Similar inter
changes and identifications of the North and West are referred to by Menzel, Die vorchristliche Unsterblichkcitslehre, i., p. 101. See
also Asiatic Researches, vol. viii., pp. 275-284.

&quot;J ai expose depuis longtemps dans mes cours au College de France une theorie d apres laquelle les Egyptiens auraient divise les quatre points en deux series groupees : Nord-Est, Sud-Ouest. . . . Ce n est que par suite de la classification dont je viens de parler qu on
met souvent a 1 Ouest les regions proprement situees au Sud, ou re
ciproquement au Sud les regions situees a 1 Ouest. L application de
cette idee a 1 Est nous mene aussi a croire que Ton a pu dire du Ta
noutri qu il etait au Nord.&quot; (M. Maspero, in a letter to the author, under date of December 20, 1882.) This usage could hardly have
arisen among any people not acquainted with the spherical figure of
the earth. How easily it could arise among us is illustrated by Sir John de Maundeville, who, writing in A. D. 1356, located Paradise so far to the East of England that he could no longer correctly describe the place by this term. Thus, after speaking of the Terrestrial Paradise as situate far &quot; to the East, at the beginning of the earth,&quot; he says,
&quot; But
this is not that East which we call our East, on this half, where the sun rises to us ; for when the sun is East in those parts towards Ter restrial Paradise, it is then midnight in our parts on this half, on ac count of the roundness of the earth, of which I have told you before ;
for our Lord God made the earth all round in the middle of the firma ment.&quot; Wright, Early Travels in Palestine. London, 1848 : p. 276.
The nearest way to an Eden thus located would, of course, be north ward. Its location could therefore be described with equal correct ness either by the term &quot; eastward &quot; or &quot; northward.&quot; Still another
interesting theory of its origin will suggest itself to the thoughtful student of such facts as those alluded to by Mr. Scribner in Where iid Life Begin ? pp. 32, 33.

ance with such a usage, it would be quite possible to use Qedem for a &quot;
front-country
&quot; in the North, and again, without embarrassment, to use the same term in speaking of the East.1

CHAPTER IV.
THE NAVEL OF THE EARTH. 1
He is the god who sits in the centre, on the Navel of the Earth ; and he is the interpreter of religion to all mankind. PLATO.
But at the Navel of the Earth stands Agni, clothed in richest apparel. Rig Veda.
To whom then will ye liken God ? It is HE that sitteth upon the CHUG of the Earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers. ISAIAH.
After proceeding some distance we paused to take breath where the crowd was
more dense and obstinate than usual : and I was seriously informed that this was the exact Navel of the Earth, and that these obstinate pilgrims were bowing and
kissing it, The Land and the Book.

STUDENTS of antiquity must often have marveled that in nearly every ancient literature they should
encounter the strange expression &quot; the Navel of the Earth.&quot; Still more unaccountable would it have seemed to them had they noticed how many
ancient mythologies connect the cradle of the human race with this earth-navel. The advocates of the different sites which have been assigned to Eden
have seldom, if ever, recognized the fact that no
hypothesis on this subject can be considered accept able which cannot account for this peculiar associa
tion of man s first home with some sort of natural
centre of the earth. Assuming, however, that the
human race began its history at the Pole, and that

all traditional recollections of man s unfallen state were connected with a polar Eden, the mystery
which otherwise envelops the subject immediately vanishes. We have already seen that the term &quot; navel &quot; was
anciently used in many languages for &quot;
centre,&quot; and
that the Pole, or central point of the revolving con
stellations, was the &quot; Navel of Heaven.&quot; But as to
the celestial Pole there corresponds a terrestrial one, so it is only natural that to the term the &quot; Navel of Heaven &quot; there should be the corresponding expres
sion the &quot; Navel of the Earth.&quot;
Beginning with Christian traditions, let us make
a pilgrimage to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem. There, in the portion belonging to the Greek Christians, we shall discover a round pil
lar, some two feet high, projecting from the marble
pavement, but supporting nothing. If we inquire as to its purpose, we shall be informed that it is de signed to mark the exact centre or &quot; Navel &quot; of the Earth.1 Early pilgrims and chroniclers refer to this
1 As my own inspection of this monument was nearly thirty years
ago, I have thought it well to make inquiry as to its present state. The following, written under date of Oct. 28, 1884, by my obliging friend, Dr. Selah Merrill, the United States Consul at Jerusalem, and well known as an Oriental archaeologist, will be read with much inter est :
&quot; The stone to which you refer still stands in the middle of the Church (Greek) of the Holy Sepulchre, and is called the Centre or Navel of the Earth. It is called a pillar, although it is not a pil lar, but a vase, conforming in its general shape to a large, tall fruit dish. The top is in the form of a basin, with a raised portion in its centre ; that is, in the bottom of the basin. I was told that at every
feast bread was laid on this pillar. I am assured that it is called the Centre of the Earth only by the Arab or native Christians of Syria, and not by the Greeks proper ; also, that every Greek church in Syria that is built after the form of this one has such a pillar in
the centre. Within two or three years past, an old church has been

curious monument, but its antiquity no one knows. 1
As usually described, it is a monument of the geo
graphical ignorance of those who placed it there, a
proof that they supposed the edge of the &quot;flat disk&quot;
of the earth to be everywhere equidistant from this stone. In reality, it is a monument of primeval as tronomic and geographic science.
excavated a little distance north of the Damascus gate. In the Pal estine Fund Report for October, 1883, I wrote some account of this to supplement what had been written before by others. In the centre of that church there is a similar stone, but that is a real pillar. This church is no doubt very old, and is popularly spoken of as the Church of St. Stephen. In my judgment it stands on the site of an older church. &quot; It seemed to me a little singular that this object should be called
a pillar (Amud), when it is only a vase, or vase-shaped ; but as the tradition connected with it is very old, the name may have come down from the time when the object used for this purpose was actually a pillar or column.&quot;
It is interesting to compare with the foregoing the description given by Bernard Surius, of Brussels, in the year 1646, particularly as at that time the &quot; Oriental Greeks &quot; seem to have had no scruple in call ing the pillar the Centre of the Earth :
&quot; Omtrent het midden steckt eenen witten marmer-steen uyt, van twee voeten in syn vierkant, daer een rondt putteken in is, t welck soo de Oostsche Griecken seggen, het midden van den aerdt-bodem is.&quot; Reyse van Jerusalem. Ant
werp, 1649 : P- 664. 1 Bishop Argulf, in his pilgrimage, A. D. 700, &quot;saw some other relics, and he observed a lofty column in the holy places to the north of the Church of Golgotha, in the middle of the city, which at mid day at the summer solstice casts no shadow ; which shows that this is the centre of the earth.&quot; Wright, Early Travels in Palestine, p. 4. As late as A. D. 1102, it still seems to have been outside the then ex isting Church. Bishop Saewulf says, &quot;At the head of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, in the -wall outside, not far from the place of Cal vary, is the place called Compos, which our Lord Jesus Christ him self signified and measured with his own hand as the middle of the world according to the words of the Psalmist, God is my king of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth. &quot;
Ibid., p. 38. In 1322, however, it is described by Sir John de Maundeville as &quot; in the midst of the Church.&quot; Ibid., p. 167. At one time in the Middle Ages, the spot seems to have been marked by a letter or inscription.



228 PARADISE FOUND.
To find the true symbolical and commemorative character of this pillar, we need to remind ourselves of a tendency ever present and active among men.
We have already alluded to the scores of &quot; Calva ries &quot; which have been set apart in Roman Catholic lands, and hallowed as memorial mounts. Up the side of each leads a Via dolorosa, with its different
&quot;
stations,&quot; each recalling to the mind, by sculptured reliefs or otherwise, one of the immortal incidents of the Passion. On the summit is the full cruci
fixion tableau, the Saviour hanging aloft upon the cross, between two crucified malefactors. The spear, the reed with the sponge, the hammer, all are there, sometimes the ladder also ; and near by, the tomb wherein never man was laid. In the minds
of the worshipers it is a holy place. Even in our Protestant republic, on the shore of
Lake Chautauqua, we have seen successfully carried
out, in our own day, a complete reproduction of Pal estine. Thousands have visited it to take objectlessons in Sacred Geography. From it these thou sands have gained clearer ideas of the relative positions and bearings of Hermon and Tabor and Olivet, of Kedron and Cherith and the Jordan, of Nazareth and Hebron and the Holy City, than else
they ever would have had. What here has been done for purposes of instruction has elsewhere and often upon a greater or smaller scale, been done for
purposes of direct religious edification, and for the
gratification of religious sentiment. Now, just as Christians love to localize in their

own midst their &quot; Holy Places,&quot; so the early nations of the world loved to create miniature reproductions
of Eden, the fair and sacred country in which man dwelt in the holy morning hours of his existence.1
The traditional temple architecture of many early
religions was determined by this symbolical and commemorative motive. This was eminently true of the sacred architecture of the Babylonians, Egyp tians, Hebrews, and Chinese.2 Koeppen assures us
that &quot;
every orthodoxly constructed Buddhist temple either is, or contains, a symbolical representation of the divine regions of Meru, and of the heaven of
the gods, saints, and Buddhas, rising above it.&quot; 3
Lillie says, &quot;The thirteen pyramidal layers at the
top of every temple in Nepal represent the thirteen unchangeable heavens of Amitabha.&quot; 4 With what
1
&quot; The Hindus generally represent Mount Meru of a conical figure, and kings were formerly fond of raising mounds of earth in that shape, which they venerated like the divine Meru, and the gods were
called down by spells to come and dally upon them. They are called Meru-sringas, or the peaks of Meru. There are four of them either in or near Benares ; the more modern, and of course the more per fect, is at a place called Sar-nath. It was raised in the year of Christ 1027. . . . This conical hill is about sixty feet high, with a small but handsome octagonal temple on the summit. It is said in the inscrip tion that this artificial hill was intended as a representation of the worldly Meru, the hill of God, and the tower of Babel, with its seven steps or zones, was probably raised with a similar view and for the same purpose.&quot; Wilford in Asiatic Researches, vol. viii., p. 291. 2 Miller, &quot;The Pyramidal Temple,&quot; in the Oriental and Bib.

astonishing elaboration this idea has sometimes been carried out may be seen in the Senbyoo temple in
Mengoon, near the capital of Burmah. 1 That the natural features of the landscape were often utilized
in producing these symbolic shrines and holy places
is only what we should expect. &quot; The Buddhists of
Ceylon,&quot; as Obry states,
&quot; have endeavored to trans form their central mountain, Deva-Kuta (Peak of the Gods), into Meru, and to find four streams descend ing from its sides to correspond with the rivers of
their Paradise.&quot; 2
Again, in the &quot; rock-cut &quot;
temples of Ellora, we
have, in like manner, a complete representation of the Paradise of Siva. Faber develops the evidence of this practice among the ancients with great full ness, and with respect to the Hindus and Buddhists
says,
&quot; Each pagoda, each pyramid, each montiform
high-place/ is invariably esteemed to be a copy of the holy hill Meru,&quot; the Hindu s Paradise. 3
From &quot; Records of the Past,&quot; vol. x., p. 50, we see that the Egyptians had the same custom of building temples in such a manner that they should be sym bolical of the abode of the gods. So in Greece and

were associated at a later period with Mount Zion in Jerusalem, and with the Mohammedan Mecca and other sacred localities.

Rome the citadel mounts in their cities had quite as
great religious as military significance. Lenormant,
speaking of Rome and Olympia, remarks, &quot; It is im
possible not to note that the Capitoline was first of
all the Mount of Saturn, and that the Roman archae
ologists established a complete affinity between the Capitoline and Mount Cronios in Olympia, from the
standpoint of their traditions and religious origin
(Dionysius Halicarn., i., 34). This Mount Cronios is, as it were, the Omphalos of the sacred city of
Elis, the primitive centre of its worship. It some times receives the name Olympos.&quot;
1 Here is not
only symbolism in general, but also a symbolism
pointing to the Arctic Eden, already shown to be the primeval mount of Kronos, the Omphalos of the whole earth. 2 Now, as Jerusalem is one of the most ancient of
the sacred cities of the world, and, at the same time, the one where the tradition of the primeval Paradise
was preserved in its clearest and most historic form,
it would be strange if, in all its long history, no king or priesthood had ever tried to enhance its attrac
tiveness and sanctity by making it, or some part of
it, symbolize Earth s earliest Holy Land, and com
memorate man s earliest Theocracy. That the at

visitor is shown the spot where, according to one
tradition, Adam was created. 1 Not many feet away, under the custody of another religion, he finds the sacred rock-hewn grave in which at least the head of the first of men was buried. 2 In the little Gihon, the name of one of the Paradise rivers still lives. The miraculous virtue of the Pool of Bethsaida
was ascribed in early Christian legend to its being in subterranean contact with the Tree of Life, which grew in the midst of Paradise.3 Christ s cross was said to have been made of the wood of the
same tree. The very name, Mount Sion, is a memo
rial one. The Talmudic account of &quot; The Strength of the Hill of Sion &quot; shows that the Palestinian
mount was named after the heavenly one, and not
vice versa, as commonly supposed. The true sacred name of the Holy City is, therefore, not Sion
(though it is often called by the heavenly appella tion also), but &quot; Daughter of Sion.&quot; She is simply

a copy, a miniature likeness, of the true mount and
city of God &quot; in the sides of the North.&quot; 1
So confident is Lenormant that Solomon and Hezekiah intentionally conformed their capital to the Paradisaic mount, and intentionally introduced in their public works features which should sym
bolize and commemorate peculiarities of Eden, that he uses the fact as an unanswerable argument
against those imaginative critics who would place the composition of the second chapter of Genesis
subsequent to the Babylonian exile. He says, &quot; Another proof, and a very decisive one in my
opinion, of the high antiquity of the narrative of Genesis concerning Eden, and of the knowledge of it possessed by the Hebrews long before the Captiv ity, is the intention so clearly proved by Ewald to imitate the four rivers which predominated in the works of Solomon and Hezekiah for the distri
bution of the waters of Jerusalem, which, in its turn, was considered as the Umbilicus of the Earth (Ezek. v. 5), in the double sense of centre of the inhabited regions and source of the rivers. The four streams which watered the town and the foot of its ram parts one of which was named Gihon (i Kings
i- 33&amp;gt; 38 ; 2 Chron. xxxii. 30, xxxiii. 14), like one of the Paradisaic rivers were, as Ewald has shown, reputed to issue through subterranean communica tions from the spring of fresh water situated be neath the Temple, the sacred source of life and
purity to which the prophets (Joel iii. 1 8 ; Ezek.

234 PARADISE FOUND.
In this citation, in addition to a strong assertion of the symbolical character of the topography and
waterworks of Jerusalem, we have the location it
self included in this symbolism. The city is said to have been the Umbilicus or Navel of the Earth, for
two reasons : first, because of its relation to sur rounding countries ;
* and, second, because of its containing the source of the rivers. In our next
chapter, this last reason will become more significant than even the writer intended. At present we will
only add that the true philosophy of this symbolical centrality of Jerusalem is found in two facts : first, the Hebrews had a tradition that primeval Eden
was the Centre of the Earth : 2 and, second, by styling Jerusalem the Navel of the Earth, as they did, it was symbolically all the more assimilated to the prim itive Paradise which in so many other ways it sa
credly commemorated.
Passing to the field of Hellenic tradition, we are told by all modern interpreters that the Greeks
shared the &quot;narrow conceit and ignorance of all
ancient nations,&quot; and supposed their own land to
occupy the middle of the &quot;flat earth-disk.&quot; And
because of certain expressions in Pindar and a pas
sage in Pausanias, it is affirmed as a first principle in the geography of the ancient Greeks that Delphi was believed to be the exact topographical centre
point of the whole earth.
1 That this traditionally-given first reason for the appellation is not well founded is evident from the fact that the Hebrews had a &quot; Navel of the Earth,&quot; farther to the North, before ever they had possessed themselves of the site of Jerusalem (Judg. ix. 37). 2 In Origen, Sdectis ad Genesin, we read, &quot; Tradunt Hebraei lo cum, in quo Paradisum plantavit Deus, Eden vocari, et ajunt ipsum mundi medium esse, ut pupillam oculi&quot; Compare Hershon, Tal* mudic Miscellany, p. 300.



THE NAVEL OF THE EARTH. 235
Such a representation is far from satisfactory. For while the term &quot; Omphalos of the Earth &quot; was un
doubtedly applied in a sense to Delphi, it belonged
to it only as the name Athens belongs to many a town thus designated in America. It had other and older topographical connections and associations.
We find traces of the same title in connection with
Olympos, with Ida, with Parnassos, with Ogygia, with Nyssa, with Mount Meros, with Delos, with Athens, with Crete, and even with Meroe. In the
multiplicity of these localizations, the people seem to have lost the clue to the original significance of the conception, and to have contrived crude etymologi
cal myths of their own for the explanation of what seemed to them a remarkable designation. 1 The moment we make the true original Omphalos of the Earth the North Pole, and invest it with sa
cred traditionary recollections of Eden life, all this
confusion becomes clear. The &quot; centre-stone&quot; of
Delphi, like the Omphalium of the Cretans, becomes merely a memorial shrine, an attempted copy of the
great original. And if all the Olymps and Idas
and Parnassos mounts were alike convenient repro ductions and localizations of the one celestial moun tain of the gods at the North Pole, what wonder if we find each of them in some way designated as the Centre of the Earth.

has in like manner all the marks of a mythico-tradi
tional north polar Eden. Its name, Ogygia, connects it with a far-off antediluvian antiquity. 1 It is situ
ated in the far North, and Odysseus needs the blast of Boreas to bring him away from its shores on
the homeward journey. Its queen, Calypso, is the daughter of Atlas ; and Atlas proper station in
Greek mythology, as elsewhere shown, is at the ter
restrial Pole. Its beauty is Paradisaic, it being
adorned with groves and &quot; soft meadows of violets,&quot; so beautiful, in fact, that &quot; on beholding it even an Immortal would be seized with wonder and delight.&quot;
2
Finally, identifying the place beyond all question,
we have the Eden &quot;
fountain,&quot; whose waters part
into &quot;four streams, flowing each in opposite direc
tions.&quot; 3
In Mount Meros we have only the Greek form of Meru, as long ago shown by Creuzer.4 The one is the Navel of the Earth for the same reason that
the other -is. Egyptian Meroe (in some Egyptian
texts Mer, in Assyrian Mirukk, or Mirukka), the seat of the famous oracle of Jupiter Ammon, was
possibly named from the same &quot;World-mountain.&quot;
This would explain the passage in Quintus Curtius, which has so troubled commentators, wherein
the object which represented the divine being is
described as resembling a &quot;navel set in gems.&quot;

When the two doves of Zeus, flying from the two opposite ends of the world, determine the cosmic centralness of &quot;
Parnassos,&quot; it is of an antediluvian Parnassos that the myth is speaking. 1 It is that
mount on whose polar top we have already found the &quot; domicilium &quot; of Zeus.
Nonnos, in describing the symbolical peplos which Harmonia wove on the loom of Athene, says,
&quot; First
she represented the earth with its omphalos in the centre ; around the earth she spread out the sphere of heaven varied with the figures of the stars. . . . Lastly, along the exterior edge of the well-woven
vestment she represented the Ocean in a circle.&quot; 2 That Delphi or the Phocian Parnassos is the ompha los here mentioned is far enough from credible. It is the Pole, and the manner in which the term is in troduced shows that it was perfectly understood by
every reader, and needed no explanation. The true shrine of Apollo was not at Delphi, but in that older earth-centre of which Plato speaks in the motto pre fixed to this section. His real home is among &quot;the
Hyperboreans,&quot; in a land of almost perpetual light ; and it is only upon annual visits that he comes to Delphi. 3 The remembrance of this fact would have
Pauranics say that . . . the first climate is that of Meru ; among the
Greeks and Romans the first climate was that of. Meroe.&quot; Wilford in Asiatic Researches, vol. viii., p. 289. 1 &quot;Before this time&quot; the time of the deluge of Deucalion
&quot; Zeus had once wanted to know where the middle of the earth was, and had let fly two doves at the same moment from the two ends of the world, to see where they would meet ; they met on Mount Par nassos, and thus it was proved beyond a doubt that this mountain must be the centre of the earth.&quot; C.

helped the interpreters of Pindar out of more than
one perplexity. 1 According to Hecataeus, Leto, the mother of Apollo and his sister Artemis, was born on an island in the Arctic Ocean, &quot; beyond the
North wind.&quot; Moreover, on this island inhabited by
the Hyperboreans, Apollo is unceasingly worshiped in a huge round temple, in a city whose inhabitants
are perpetually playing upon lyres and chanting to his praise. 2 So reports Diodorus (it., 47) ; and here
with agrees the imaginary journey of Apollonius of Tyana, a namesake of Apollo, who tells of his journey far to the North of the Caucasus into the
regions of the pious Hyperboreans, among whom he found a lofty sacred mountain, the Omphalos of the Earth. 3 In the Phaedo we have a charming description of Plato s terrestrial Paradise. &quot; In this fair region,&quot;

THE NAVEL OF THE EARTH. 239
Socrates is made to say,
&quot; all things that grow trees and flowers and fruit are fairer than any here ; and there are hills and stones in them smoother and more transparent and fairer in color
than our highly-valued emeralds and sardonyxes and jaspers and other gems, which are but minute frag ments of them : for there all the stones are like our
precious stones, and fairer still. The temperament of their seasons is such that the inhabitants have
no disease, and live much longer than we do, and have sight and hearing and smell and all the other
senses in much greater perfection. And they have temples and sacred places in which the gods really dwell, and they hear their voices, and receive their answers, and are conscious of them, and hold con verse with them, and they see the sun, the moon,
and the stars as they really are.&quot; 1 If we ask as to the location of this divinely beau
tiful abode, every indication of the text agrees with
our hypothesis. It is right under the eye when the world is looked at from its summit, the North
ern celestial pole.2 Viewed from the standpoint of
Greece and its neighbor lands it is &quot; above&quot; it
is &quot; the upper Earth&quot; the dazzling top of the &quot; round&quot;
world. In it, moreover, is the Navel of the Earth,
/ueo-oycua, inhabited by happy men.
If anything is needed to disprove the common no tion that geographical ignorance and national self
esteem first governed the ancient peoples in locating in their own countries &quot; navels &quot; of the earth, it is furnished by what is, in all probability, the oldest
epic in the world, that of Izdhubar, fragments of
1 Phcedo, 1 10, in. 2

which have survived in the oldest literature of Baby
lonia. These fragments show that the earliest in habitants of the Tigro-Euphrates basin located &quot; the Centre of the Earth,&quot; not in their own midst, but in
a far-off land, of sacred associations, where &quot; the
holy house of the gods&quot; is situated, a land &quot;into
the heart whereof man hath not penetrated ;
&quot; a
place underneath the &quot; overshadowing world-tree,&quot;
and beside the &quot; full waters.&quot; 1 No description could more perfectly identify the spot with the Arctic Pole of ancient Asiatic mythology. Yet this testimony stands not alone ; for in the fragment of another ancient text, translated by Sayce in &quot; Records of the
Past,&quot; we are told of a &quot;
dwelling&quot; which &quot;the gods created for &quot; the first human beings, a dwelling in
which they &quot; became great
&quot; and &quot;increased in num
bers,&quot; and the location of which is described in
words exactly corresponding to those of Iranian, In dian, Chinese, Eddaic, and Aztec literature ; namely,
&quot;in the Centre of the Earth.&quot; 2
In the Hindu Puranas we are told over and over that the earth is a sphere, and that Mount Meru is its Navel or Pole. 3 But the expression ndbhi, or &quot; Navel &quot; of the earth, is older than the Puranas,
though the very meaning of Purana is &quot;ancient.&quot; Like the term &quot; Navel of Heaven,&quot; it occurs in the

hymns of the earliest Veda. But where was the
sacred shrine to which it was applied ? It was no
holy place in Bactria, or in the Punjab. Nothing
tends to locate it in India. On the other hand, the
fifth verse of the one hundred and eighty-fifth hymn, mandala first, of the Rig Veda, seems most plainly to fix it at the North Pole. In this verse Night and
Day are represented as twin sisters in the bosom
of their parents Heaven and Earth ; each bounding
or limiting the other, but both kissing simultane ously the Ndbhi of the Earth. Now, everywhere
upon earth, except in the polar regions, Night and
Day seem ever to be pursuing and supplanting
each other. They have no common ground. At the Pole and only there they may be said, with
locked arms, to spin round and round a common
point, and unitedly to kiss it from the opposite sides. 1
This plainly is the meaning of the poet ; and re
membering all the legendary splendors of the polar
mountain around which sun and moon are ever mov ing, we must pronounce the figure as beautiful as it is instructive. 2
1 The following versions may be compared :
&quot; Zusammenlcommend, die beiden Jungen, deren Enden zusammenstossen, die verbiindeteten Schwestern in der beiden Aeltern Schosse, kussend den Nabel der Welt, schiitzt uns, Himmel und Erde, vor Gewalt.&quot; Ludwig, i. 182. &quot;Going always together, equally young and of like termination, sisters and kindred, and scenting \sic\ the navel of the world, placed on their lap as its parents ; defend us, Heaven and Earth, from great
danger.&quot; Wilson, ii., 188.

2 A later poet has borrowed the same idea : 16

In perfect accord herewith, we find the bard ask ing, in another hymn, where the Navel of the Earth
is ; and in doing it he associates it as closely as pos
sible, not with some central home-shrine in his own land, but with the extreme &quot; End of the Earth&quot; an
expression used again and again, in ancient lan guages, for the Pole and its vicinity. 1 Again, in another Vedic passage, the Navel of the
Earth is located upon &quot;the mountains,&quot; and this as sociation points us to the North. 2 Still stronger evi dence of its polar location is found in other hymns, where the supporting column of heaven the Atlas pillar of Vedic cosmology is described as stand ing in or upon the Navel of the Earth. 3 Finally, so unmistakable is the Vedic teaching on
this subject that a recent writer, after asserting with all his teachers that the cosmography of the Vedic bards was &quot;
embryonic,&quot; and their earth a &quot; flat
disk&quot; overarched by a solid firmament, which was &quot; soldered on to the edge of the disk at the horizon,&quot;
nevertheless, later, in studying one of the cosmo
gonical hymns of DIrghatamas, the son of Mamata,
reaches the conclusion that the singer had knowl edge both of the celestial and of the terrestrial Pole,
and that, in seeking to answer the question as to the
&quot; Around the fire in solemn rite they trod,

Like Day and starry Midnight when they meet
In the broad plains at lofty Meru sfeet.&quot;

We have seen that, according to Old-Iranian tra dition also, man was created in the &quot;central&quot; divis

the strength of all kinds of trees,&quot; was &quot; in the vi

stroyer came, was &quot; in the Middle of the Earth.&quot; 3
Mount Taera (Pahl. : Terak), the celestial Pole, and Kakad-i-Daitik, the mountain of the terrestrial Pole, are each described in similar terms : the one as
&quot;Centre of the World,&quot; the other as &quot;Centre of the
Earth.&quot; 4 The expression Apdm Nepdt, the &quot; Navel
of the Waters,&quot; occurs in the Avestan writings again and again, and is always applied either to the worldfountain from which all waters proceed, or to the
spirit presiding over it. 5 But as this world-foun

Passing to Japan, it is curiously interesting to note that the Ainos, who are supposed to have been the first inhabitants, are believed to have come into
the archipelago &quot; from the North ;
&quot; 1 that their heaven is on inaccessible mountain-tops in the same
quarter ;
2 and that their name, according to some
authorities, etymologically signifies
&quot;
Offspring of the Centred 3 In burial, their dead are always so placed that when resurrected their faces will be set toward the lofty northern country from which their ancestors are believed to have come, and to which their spirits are believed to have returned.4
1 Griffis, The Mikado s Empire, p. 27. 2
&quot; These [a mythological pair] were the ancestors of the Ainos. Their offspring, in turn, married ; some among each other, others
with the bears of the mountains [the Bear Tribe?]. The fruits of this latter union were men of extraordinary valor and nimble hunters,
who, after a long life spent in the vicinity of their birth, departed to the far North, where they still live on the high and inaccessible table lands above the mountains ; and, being immortal, they direct, by
their magical influences, the actions and the destiny of men ; that is, the Ainos.&quot; Ibid., p. 28.
8 Ai-no-ko. Ibid., p. 29. 4
&quot; It may not be devoid of interest to mention here that the Ainos
bury their dead with the head to the South. . . . The Aino, to-day, as he did in ancient times, buries his dead by covering the body with matting, and placing it with the head to the South in a grave which is about three feet deep.&quot; Notes on Japanese Archccology with es pecial reference to the Stone Age, by Henry von Siebold, Yokohama, 1879, p. 6. Let no reader imagine this a meaningless rite of un developed savages. &quot; From all these observations, as well as from the traditions of the Ainos, in which are ever-recurring laments for a better past ; and from many peculiarities in their customs, we must conclude that the Ainos are to be classed with those peoples that have earlier been more richly supplied with the implements of civili zation, but have become degraded through isolation. Prehistoric discoveries . . . favor this view. The pits found there for dwellings indicate that the Ainos came from the North to Yezo.&quot; Professor Brauns, of Halle. Translated from Memoirs of the Berlin Anthropo logical Society, in Science, Cambridge, 1884; p. 72.

Taking these facts in connection with those pre
sented in chapter second of the preceding part, one can hardly evade the conclusion that, when Griffis informs us that the Japanese considered their
country as lying at &quot;the top of the world,&quot; and when others say that the Japanese once regarded their
country as the &quot; Centre of the World,&quot; 1 it is most probable that these writers have applied to the
Japan of to-day ideas which originally belonged to a far-distant prehistoric polar Japan, the primitive seat of the race, as it has lived on in these most ancient traditions of the Ainos. In Scandinavian mythology we meet with a sim
ilar idea. In the Eddas, both Asgard and Idavollr are represented as in &quot; the Centre of the World ;
&quot;
and at least one author, in explaining the reason of it, has come within a hair s-breadth of the truth,
though missing it. 2 The ancient Mexicans conceived of the cradle of the human race as situated in the farthest North,
upon the highest of mountains, cloud-surrounded,
1
&quot; The Japanese in their earlier separation regarded their country as the centre and most important part of the world.&quot; J. J. Rein, Japan, Travels and Researches, English translation. London, 1884 :

the residence of the god Tlaloc. Thence come the rains and all streams, for Tlaloc is the god of waters.
The first man, Quetzalcoalt, after having ruled as king of the Golden Age in Mexico, returned by divine direction to the primeval Paradise in the
North (Tlapallan), and partook of the draught of immortality. The stupendous terraced pyramidtemple in Cholula was a copy and symbol of the sacred Paradise-mountain of Aztec tradition, which was described as standing &quot; in the Centre of the

found the same idea of a Navel of the Earth, and even among the Chickasaws of Mississippi. 1
Thus is all ancient thought full of this legendary
idea of a mysterious, primeval, holy, Paradisaic Earth-centre, a spot connected as is no other with the &quot;Centre of Heaven,&quot; the Paradise of God. Why it should be so no one has ever told us ; but
the hypothesis which places the Biblical Eden at the Pole, and makes all later earth navels commemora
tive of that primal one, affords a perfect explana tion. In the light of it, there is no difficulty in
understanding that Earth-centre in Jerusalem with
which we began. The inconspicuous pillar in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre symbolizes and com memorates far more than the geographical ignorance of mediaeval ages. It stands for the Japanese pillar by which the first soul born upon earth mounted to the sky. It stands for the World -column of the East-Aryans and the Chinvat Bridge of Iran. It stands for the law-proclaiming pillar of orichalcum in Atlantis, placed in the centre of the most central land. It stands for that Talmudic pillar by means of which the tenants of the terrestrial Paradise
mount to the celestial, and, having spent the Sab

It perpetuates a religious symbolism which existed in its region be fore ever Jerusalem had been made the Hebrew capital, recalling to our modern world the tabbur ha-aretz of a period anterior to the days of Samuel. 1 In tradition it is said to mark the precise spot &quot; whence the clay was taken, out of which the body
of Adam was modeled.&quot; It does so, but it does it
in a language and method which were common to all the most ancient nations of the earth. It points not to the soil in which it stands, but to the holier
soil of a far-away primitive Eden. 2

&quot;AND a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from thence it was parted and became
into four heads.&quot;
In chapter second of Part Second we presented
the simple and natural interpretation suggested by the hypothesis of a primitive circumpolar continent. If the reader will kindly turn back to the statement
there made (p. 5 i), he will see in how natural a man
ner the water system of that lost &quot; land of delights
&quot;
might have become, in after tradition, the one dis parted river which waters the whole earth.
The insuperable difficulties of all hitherto at
tempted identifications of the four rivers are too nu
merous to present here in detail. 1 In our interpreta

&quot; We entirely agree with Delitzsch [the elder] that Paradise is lost, and the four streams are on this account a riddle which cries, Where is Paradise ? the question remaining without an answer.&quot; Ebers, ALgypten und die Biicher Mose, p. 30.

tion the original river is from the sky ; the division takes place on the heights at the Pole, and the four resulting rivers are the chief streams of the circumpolar continent as they descend in different direc tions to the surrounding sea. Does such a view find any support in the traditions of the ancient world ? That it does will be clear to any one who has carefully read thus far. Let us take the rivers of the Persian cradle of the race. Where do they rise ?
If the investigator of this question have made no
previous studies in Comparative Sacred Hydrog raphy, he will be surprised to find that in Persian
thought, not only the Paradise rivers, but also all the rivers of the whole earth, have but one head
spring and but one place of discharge. This head-spring is the Ardvi-Sura, situated in heaven, the heaven of the Pole. &quot; This heavenly
fountain,&quot; says Haug, summarizing the contents of
the Aban Yasht, &quot; this heavenly fountain has a thousand springs and a thousand canals, each of them
forty days journey long. Thence a channel goes through all the seven keshvares, or regions of the earth, conveying everywhere pure celestial waters.&quot; *
the Biblical Eden has been discovered, whether in Asia, Africa, Europe, or America.&quot; Gerald Massey, The Natural Genesis, vol. ii.,
p. 162. We may add that Mr. Samuel Johnson s suggestion (Oriental Religions ; Persia. Boston, 1885 : p. 253), to the effect that the &quot; four rivers &quot; of the Hebrew story consisted of two real rivers, the Tigris and
the Euphrates, plus two imaginary &quot; words, that simply mean flowing
waters, and that were used as generic terms for the purpose of mak ing up the number four, the conventional sign of completeness in all Eastern mythologies,&quot; is a characteristic specimen of the unschol
arly and dogmatic caprice of pantheistic exegesis in the field of an cient religious ideas and their history. 1 Essays, 2d ed., p. 198. See Darmesteter s translation :
&quot; From
this river of mine alone flow all the waters that spread all over the



252 PARADISE FOUND.
The following is an ancient invocation to Ana
hita, the spirit of these heavenly waters :
&quot; Come
before me, Ardvi-Sura Anahita ! come down from yonder stars on to the earth created by Ahura
Mazda ! Thee shall worship the handy lords, the
rulers of countries, sons of the rulers of countries.&quot; l
From its elevation the heavenly height is called
Hugar, i. e.,
&quot; the lofty :
&quot;
&quot; Hugar, the lofty, is the mount from which the water of Ardvi-Sura leaps
down the height of a thousand men.&quot; 2 Again it is
written, &quot; Hugar, the lofty, on which the water of Ardvi-Sura flows and leaps, is the chief of summits, since it is that above which is the revolution of
Sataves, the chief of reservoirs.&quot; 3
As all the rivers of the earth s seven regions, so all lakes and seas and the ocean itself, are from this one celestial fountain. &quot;Through the warmth and clearness of the water, purifying more than other
seven keshvares ; this river of mine alone goes on bringing waters
both in summer and in winter.&quot; The Zend-Avesta, Pt. ii., pp. 52-84. 1 Haug, Ibid., p. 198. Darmesteter, Ibid., p. 73. 2 Bundahish (West), xii. 5. The Zend-Avesta (Darmesteter), ii.

8 Bundahish, xxiv. 17. When West (Pahlavi Texts, Pt. i., p. 35, note 6) uses the last clause of this quotation to show that the loca tion of Hugar is &quot; probably &quot; in the western quarter, his argument rests upon two mistakes, both of which seem to be shared by all modern Avestan students. The first mistake is to suppose Sataves a different star from Tishtar (Tijtrya) ; and the second is the notion that Tishtar was the star now called Sirius. The fact is that orig
inally Satavaesa and Ti-rtrya were simply two designations for one and the same object, and that object was not our Sirius, but the Pole
star. I say our Sirius, because there is evidence that this name also once belonged to a very different heavenly body, and to one situated in &quot; die Mitte des Himmels&quot; i. e., at the Pole. (Ideler, Sternennamen, p. 216.) Hugar (Hukairya) is the heavenly height of the polar sky, high above Hara-berezaiti, whenever this term is applied, as originally, to the terrestrial polar mount. Abdn Yasht, 88. See Windischmann, Zoroastrische Studien,^. 171.

waters, everything continually flows from the source Ardvi-Sura.&quot; * However named, all waters are sim
ply portions of the same heaven-descending stream. &quot; The other innumerable waters and rivers, springs
and channels, are one in origin with those, so in va rious districts and various places they call them
by various names.&quot; 2 Even plant-sap, and blood, and milk, and all the seventeen kinds of liquid enumer ated in the Yashts, are parts of the one cosmic cur

is formed, mingle again with the rivers, for the body which is formed and the growth are both one.&quot; 3
Everything of a liquid nature, therefore, in the whole world is conceived of as proceeding from one
source high in the north-polar sky. Whither is it tending ? What becomes of it all in the end ? Where do its myriad rills and rivers at last dis
charge ? As according to the cosmological concep tion so often illustrated in these pages, all start from
the zenith, we should naturally expect all to reunite at last in the nadir. This is found to be the fact.

cumulate. 1 This cesspool of the universe has vious bottom. By the various processes of strain
ing, vaporizing, aeration, etc., the polluted waters are by Tishtar brought back distilled and purified, and are re-discharged into the zenith-reservoir which
perpetually supplies the gushing streams of ArdviSura. 2 Into such a marvelously complete cosmical
circulatory water system did the Iranic imagination develop the primitive head - stream of Eden. But
never, even in the most extravagant mythological adornments of the idea, was it for a moment forgot ten that the original undivided stream originates in the north polar sky ; and that its division into earthly streams and rivers is on the holy mount which stands in the centre of Kvaniras, the central and circumpolar keshvare of the whole habitable earth. 3 The various fragmentary allusions of the oldest Greek poets to Okeanos and the rivers would seem
to imply the early existence, and perhaps early loss, of a similar Hellenic conception of the water cir culation of the entire earth. Thus, according to
Homer s familiar couplet, it is from Okeanos, in

THE QUADRIFURCATE RIVER. 255
some application of the term, that &quot; all rivers and
every sea and all fountains flow.&quot; 1 Euripides pre
sents the same idea.2 There is, therefore, one foun tain of all the world s waters. The same conception
is expressed by Hesiod in his Theogony, where all
rivers, as sons, and all fountains and brooks, as daughters, are traced back to Okeanos. Then we
have a constant descending movement of all waters until they reach the world-surrounding Ocean-river at the equator, beyond which is the Underworld.
From this equatorial ocean, parting off from the southern or under shore, new branches diverge and form the river system of the Hadean kingdom. Other Underworld rivers were perhaps conceived of as percolating through the earth and emerging to the surface in the lower hemisphere. There is at least some evidence that the Greeks, like the Per
sians, had this idea of interterranean water-courses, and even rivers, resembling the circulation of the blood in the human body. 3 Sometimes these Under world rivers are represented as four in number, thus
making the circumpolar water system of the Under world a perfect counterpart of the Eden rivers at the summit of the upper hemisphere.4 All, more over, like those of the Persian Underworld, seem to be plunging forward and ever downward, until in
the last glimpse which the imagination can catch they are seen streaming from the roof of the grot
of the goddess Styx, and, as Preller expresses it,
1 Iliad, xxi. 195. 2 Hippolytus, 119. 8 Bundahish, viii. 4. 4
&quot; In der Unterwelt gab es ausser dem Styx noch drei Fliisse.

well imply that the Underworld -n-poxor), or &quot;

returns in nature s perfect order to feed its original
fountain, thus conforming the whole, in every part, to the sacred hydrography of the Persians. 3 Granting this, one should locate the Okeanosfountain, not where Preller and Welcker and Volcker and the other mythographers have hitherto placed it, but in the farthest North, and in the sky. That
this location was the original one is plain from all
the local implications of the mythological accounts of the proper home of Okeanos and Tethys, and is further confirmed by many incidental evidences con
nected with such myths as those of the Eridanus,4 the
Acheloos, the birth of Zeus, and particularly those of Atlas and his children. 5

&quot; Fountf ul Ida &quot; corresponds almost perfectly to the Iranian Hugar, down whose sides leap and flow the waters of Ardvi-Sura. Moreover, in its very name Lenormant and others see a root connect ing it with Ilavrita, the circumpolar paradisaic varsha of Puranic geography. It should be added that to Ilavrita corresponds signifi cantly the Norse Idavollr, or &quot;

THE QUADRIFURCATE RIVER.
In the most ancient Akkadian, Assyrian, and Bab ylonian literature there are expressions which seem clearly to indicate the presence among these peo ples of a precisely similar conception with respect to the waters of the world. 1 The same is true of Egyptian literature, but in both these cases the data are as yet too meagre to make them entirely conclu
sive in argument. 2 We therefore pass them by, and close with a glance at the Eden river of the ancient Aryans of India.
This, as already seen, is the heaven-born Ganga.
The Vedas call it &quot;the river of the three worlds,&quot; for the reason that it flows through Heaven and Earth and the Underworld. In Vedic times &quot;the original source and home of the waters was thought to -be the highest heaven (paramam vyoman\ the re

by the river Ganga, which, issuing from the foot of Vishnu and washing the lunar orb, falls here [on the top of Meru] from the skies, and, after encir
cling the city, 1 divides into four mighty rivers, flow ing in opposite directions. These rivers are Si ta, the Alakananda, the Chakshu, and the Bhadra. The first, falling on the tops of the inferior mountains on the east side of Meru, flows over their crests,
and passes through the country of Bhadraswa to the ocean. The Alakananda flows south to the
country of Bharata, and, dividing into seven rivers on the way, falls into the sea. The Chakshu falls into the sea after traversing all the western moun tains and passing through Ketumala. And the Bhadra washes the country of the Uttarakurus and

mud and in Patristic theology too plain for even Massey to render valueless :
&quot; Meru is shown to be the mount which reached to the moon and became a figure of the four lunar quarters. . . . Hence the tradition that Paradise was preserved during, or was exempt from, the Deluge because it was on the summit of a mountain that reached to
the moon (Bereshith Rabba, xxxiii.) ; which shows the continuation of the typical mount of the seven stars into the lunar phase of time keeping, where the mount of the four quarters carried Eden with it.&quot; The Natural Genesis^ vol. ii., p. 244. 1 Here is probably the origin of the curious notion of the Sabaeans touching the Euphrates.

Here, again, as our interpretation of Genesis re quires, the four rivers traced back to their origin bring us to the summit of the earth at the Pole, to the one river which descends from the north polar sky. Curious confirmations of this primitive con ception come even from the most distant conti nents. 1 Late Christian legend shows evident traces of it, for in Maundeville s description of the Para dise-fountain he says,
&quot; All the sweet waters of the world above and beneath take their beginning from that well of Paradise ;
&quot; and again,
&quot; Out of that well

midst of this lake is the abode of a Naga, who is in fact the trans formed appearance of Dasabhumi Bodhisatwa (or of the Bodhisa
twas of the ten earths). From his abode proceed four refreshing rivers, which compass Jambu-dwipa. At the east side of the lake, from the mouth of a silver ox, flows out the Ganges River. After compassing the lake once it enters the sea towards the southeast. From the south side of the lake, from the mouth of a golden elephant, flows the Sindhu [Indus] River. After compassing the lake once it
enters the sea on the southwest. On the west side of the lake, flow ing from the mouth of a horse of lapis-lazuli, flows the river Foh-tzu
(Vakshu, i. e., Oxus), which, after compassing the lake once, enters
the sea on the northwest. On the north side of the lake, flowing
from a crystal lion, flows the river Sida [Hoang-ho], which after mak

IN the centre of the Garden of Eden, according to Genesis iii. 3, there was a tree exceptional in
position, in character, and in its relations to men.
Its fruit was &quot;good for food,&quot; it was &quot; pleasant to
the eyes,&quot;
&quot; a tree to be desired.&quot; * At first sight it
would not perhaps appear how a study of this tree in the different mythologies of the ancient world
could assist us in locating primitive Paradise. In the discussions of such sites as have usually been

Possibly.
&quot; The tradition of Genesis,&quot; says Lenormant, Beginnings, p. 84,
&quot; at times appears to admit two trees, one of Life and one of Knowledge, and again seems to speak of one only, uniting in itself both attributes (Gen. ii. 17 ; iii. 1-7).&quot; Compare Ernst von Bunsen,
Das Symbol des Kreuzes bei alien Nationen. Berlin, 1876 : p. 5. To make the whole account relate to one tree it would only be necessary first to translate the last clause of ch. ii. 9 &quot; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, even the tree of knowledge of good and evil ;
&quot;
and then the last clause of ch. iii. 22 &quot; and now lest he continue to put forth his hand and to take of the tree of life,&quot; etc., for both of which constructions there are abundant precedents, if only the gam be rendered with the freedom used in some other passages. As to the first, see I Sam. xvii. 40 ; xxviii. 3 ; Dan. iv. 10 ; as to the second, the Hebrew grammars on the use of the future. Compare also Prov. iii. 13, 1 8, where wisdom is a tree of life.

proposed it could not ; but if the Garden of Eden
was precisely at the North Pole, it is plain that a goodly tree standing in the centre of that Garden would have had a visible and obvious cosmical signif
icance which could by no possibility belong to any other. Its fair stem shooting up as arrow-straight as
the body of one of the &quot;
giant trees of California,&quot; far
overtopping, it may be, even such gigantic growths as these, would to any one beneath have seemed the living pillar of the very heavens. Around it
would have turned the &quot; stars of God,&quot; as if in hom
age ; through its topmost branches the human wor shiper would have looked up to that unmoving
centre-point where stood the changeless throne of
the Creator. How conceivable that that Creator should have reserved for sacred uses this one natural
altar-height of the Earth, and that by special com
mand He should have guarded its one particular adornment from desecration ! (Gen. ii. 16, 17.) If anywhere in the temple of nature there was to be an altar, it could only be here. That it was here finds a fresh and unexpected confirmation in the sin
gular agreement of many ancient religions and my thologies in associating their Paradise-Tree with the
axis of the world, or otherwise, with eqttal unmistakableness, locating it at the Arctic Pole of the Earth.1 That the Northmen conceived of the universe as

a tree (the Yggjjrasfl) is well known to ordinary
readers. Its roots are in the lowest hell, its midbranches inclose or overarch the abode of men, its top reaches the highest heaven of the gods. It was
their poetical way of saying that the whole world
is an organic unity pervaded by one life. As the abode of the gods was in the north polar sky, the summit of the tree was at that point, its base in the south polar abyss, its trunk coincident with the axis of heaven and earth.1 It was, therefore, in po
sition and in nature precisely what an idealizing
imagination magnifying the primitive tree of Para
dise to a real World-tree would have produced.2 But while most readers are familiar with this Norse myth, few are aware how ancient and univer
sal an idea it represents. This same tree appears
in the earliest Akkadian mythology.3 And what is
precisely to our purpose, it stood, as we have before
seen, at * the Centre &quot; or Pole of the earth, where
is &quot; the holy house of the gods.&quot;

2
That section of the tree, therefore, which reaches from the abode of men into the holy heavens rises pillar-like from the Pole of the earth to the Pole of
the sky. Among the Persians the legendary tree of Para dise took on two forms, according as it was viewed with predominant reference to the universe as an
organic whole, or to the vegetable world as proceed ing from it. In the first aspect it was the Gaoke
rena (G6kard) tree, or &quot; the white Horn &quot; (Haoma =
Soma) ; in the second, the &quot;tree of all seeds,&quot; the &quot; tree opposed to harm.&quot; Of the former it is writ
ten, &quot; Every one who eats of it becomes immortal ; . . . also in the renovation of the universe they pre
pare its immortality therefrom ; it is the chief of
plants.&quot;
3 Of the second we read, &quot; In like manner

&quot; Thus the universe definitively organized by Zeus, with the assist ance of Harmonia, was depicted by Pherecydes as an immense tree, furnished with wings to promote its rotary motion, a tree whose roots were plunged into the abyss, and whose extended branches sustained the unfolded veil of the firmament decorated with the types of all ter
restrial and celestial forms.&quot; Lenormant, Beginnings of History, p. 549. Compare Louis de Ronchaud, &quot; Le Peplos d Athene Parthe

Where stood this tree which, in its dual form, was at once the source of all other trees and the giver
of immortality ? Every indication points us to the northern Pole. It was in Airan-Vej, 2 the Persian Eden, and this we have already found. It was at the source of all waters, the north polar fountain of Ardvi-Sura. 3 It was begirt with the starry girdle of the zodiacal constellations, which identifies it with
the axis of the world.4 It grew on u the highest

correctly discerns some relationship between Chinvat and the Persian Tree of Life. 1 By this identi
fication we are again brought to the one unmistak able location toward which all lines of evidence
perpetually converge. The Aryans of India, as early as in the far-off
Vedic age, had also their World-tree, which yielded the gods their soma, the drink which maintains im
mortality. As we should anticipate, its roots are in
the Underworld of Yama at the hidden pole, its top in the north polar heaven of the gods, its body is the
sustaining axis of the universe. 2 Weber long ago expressly identified it with the World-ash of the
Edda ;
3 and Kuhn,4 Senart, 5 and all the more recent
writers accept without question the identification. Grill s interesting sketch of the historic develop ments of the myth may be seen in the Appendix to
this volume.6 Some of the late traces of it in Hindu

the &quot; holy palm

at the birth of Apollo, represents the same mythical
World-tree. If so, and if we follow Hecataeus in
locating the scene, we shall be brought to the Arc

&quot; In the Naga sculptures (Fergusson, Tree and Serpent Worship,
pi. 27), the Tree of the Mount or Pole is identified at the bottom by
one tree, and at the top by another, and between the two there is a kind of ladder, with a series of steps or stairs which ascend the tree, in the place of a stem. These denote the Tree of the Ascent, Mount,
or Height, now to be considered as representing the Pole.&quot; G. Massey, The Natural Genesis, vol. i., p. 354.

position with
respect to the world of men is recognized by old Robert Burton in

&quot; The Tree of the Pole is extant in Celebes, where the na tives believe that the world is supported by the Hog, and that earth quakes are caused when the Hog rubs itself against the Tree. . . .
At Ephesus they showed the Olive and Cypress Grove of Leto, and in it the Tree of Life to which the Great Mother clung in bringing forth her twin progeny. There also was the Mount on which Hermes announced the birth of her twins Diana and Apollo [sun and moon]. The imagery is at root the same as the Hog rubbing against the Tree
of the Pole.&quot; The Natural Genesis, vol. i., p. 354. And again, the
cosmical imagery of Hesiod :

which bore the golden apples was unquestionably the Tree of Paradise ; but following ^Eschylus, Pher
ecydes, and Apollodorus, we must place it in the
farthest North, beyond the Rhipaean mountains. 2
Traces of the same mythical conception among the Romans are presented by Kuhn.3
The sacred tree of the Buddhists figures largely
in their sculpture. An elaborate specimen repre sentation may be seen on the well-known Sanchi
Tope. One inconspicuous feature in the representa tion has often puzzled observers. Almost invariably, at the very top of the tree we find a little umbrella. So universal is this that its absence occasions re mark. 4 This little piece of symbolism has a curious value. In Buddhist mythological art the umbrella symbolizes the north polar heaven of the gods,5 and by attaching it to the tip of the sacred tree the an
cient sculptors of this faith unmistakably showed the cosmical character and axial position of that to which it was attached. But this cosmic tree was the mythical B6dhi tree,
the Tree of Wisdom, &quot; Beneath whose leaves It was ordained that Truth should come to Buddh.&quot; 6

Its location is in &quot; the Middle of the Earth.&quot; l Not
withstanding his doctrine of an African origin of
mankind, Gerald Massey says,
&quot; In the legendary life of Gautama, Buddha is described as having to pass over the celestial water to reach Nirvana, which is the land of the Bodhi Tree of Life and Knowl edge. He was unable to cross from one bank to the other, but the spirit of the Bodhi tree stretched out its arms to him and helped him over in safety. By
aid of this tree he attained the summit of wisdom and immortal life. It is the same Tree of the Pole and of Paradise all mythology through. The Tree of
the Guarani garden, the Hebrew Eden, the Hindu Jambu-dwipa, is likewise the Tree of Nirvana. This
final application of the imagery proves its origin.
The realm of rest was first seen at the polar centre
of the revolving stars.&quot; 2
The ancient Germans called their World-tree the
Irmensul, i. e.,
&quot;
Heaven-pillar.&quot; Grimm speaks of its close relationship with the Norse Yggdrasil, and

2 The Natural Genesis, vol. ii., 90. On the independence of the Buddhist cosmogony and cosmology Beal remarks, &quot; But whilst we may regard Buddhism in the light of a reformation of the popular
belief in India, we must bear in mind that the stream of tradition which reappears in its teaching, and may be traced in its books, is in dependent and probably distinct from the Brahmanical traditions
embodied in the Puranas and elsewhere. At any rate, this is the case so far as the primitive question of creation and of the cosmic system
generally is concerned. Mr. Rhys Davids has already remarked that
the Buddhist archangel or god Brahma is different from anything known to the Brahmans, and is part of an altogether different system of thought (Bitddhist Suttas, p. 168 n.). I am inclined to go further than this, and say that the traditions of the Buddhists are different from those of the Brahmans in almost every respect.&quot; Samuel Beal, Buddhist Literature in China.

lends his high authority to the view that it was sim
ply a mythical expression of the idea of the world s
axis.1 The same view was advanced still earlier
by the distinguished Icelandic mythographer, Finn
Magnusen. 2 How profoundly the myth affected me
diaeval Christian art is illustrated in many places, among the rest in the sculptures on the south portal
of the Baptistery at Parma. 3 It is also not without
a deep significance that &quot;in the mediaeval legend of Seth s visit to the Garden of Eden, to obtain for his dying father the Oil of Compassion, the Tree of Life
which he saw lifted its top to heaven and sent its
root to hell;
&quot; 4 and that on the crucifixion cf Christ, himself the

274 PARADISE FOUND.
The Paradise-tree of the Chinese Tauists is also a World-tree. It is found in the centre of the en chanting Garden of the Gods on the summit of the
polar Kwen-lun. Its name is Tong, and its location
is further denned by the expression that it grows
&quot;hard by the closed Gate of Heaven.&quot; l As in many
of the ancient religions, the mount on which, after the Flood, the ark rested was considered the same as that from which in the beginning the first man came forth, it is not strange to find the tree on the top of the mountain of Paradise remembered in some of the legends of the Deluge. In the Tauist legend it seems to take the place of the ark. Thus we are told that &quot; one extraordinary antediluvian
saved his life by climbing up a mountain, and there and then, in the manner of birds plaiting a nest, he
passed his days on a tree, whilst all the country be
low him was one sheet of water. He afterwards lived to a very old age, and could testify to his late posterity that a whole race of human beings had been swept from the face of the earth.&quot; 2
It is at least suggestive to find this same idea of salvation from a universal deluge by means of a mi raculous tree growing on the top of the divine Mountain of the North among the Navajo Indians
of our own country. Speaking of the men of the world before our own, and of the warning they had
received of the approaching flood, their legends go on :
&quot; Then they took soil from all the four corner mountains of the world, and placed it on top of the mountain that stood in the North ; and thither they
all went, including the people of the mountains,

the salt-woman, and such animals as then lived in the third world. When the soil was laid on the
mountain, the latter began to grow higher and higher, but the waters continued to rise, and the
people climbed upwards to escape the flood. At length the mountain ceased to grow, and they
planted on the summit a great reed, into the hol low of which they all entered. The reed grew every
night, but did not grow in the daytime; and this is the reason why the reed grows in joints to this
day : the hollow internodes show where it grew by
night, and the solid nodes show where it rested by
day. Thus the waters gained on them in the day
time. The turkey was the last to take refuge in the
reed, and he was therefore at the bottom. When
the waters rose high enough to wet the turkey, they all knew that danger was near. Often did the waves wash the end of his tail, and it is for this reason that the tips of the turkey s tail-feathers are to this day lighter than the rest of his plumage. At the end of the fourth night from the time it was planted the reed had grown up to the floor of the fourth world, and here they found a hole through which
they passed to the surface.&quot; 1
The opening sentence of the above citation gives
us a topography exactly corresponding to Mount Meru, the Hindu &quot; mountain of the North,&quot; with its &quot; four corner mountains of the world,&quot; in the four opposite points of the horizon. Moreover, in the Deluge myths of the Hindus, as in this of the Nava

jos, it was over this central mountain that the sur&amp;lt; vivors of that world-destruction found deliverance. However explained, the coincidences are remark able. In Keltic tradition the Tree of Paradise is repre sented by the tree which bore golden apples in Avalon. But Avalon is always represented as an island in the far North, and its &quot; loadstone castle &quot;
self-evidently connects it with the region of the mag
netic Pole. 1
In the ancient epic of the Finns, the Kalevala, we see the World-tree of another people. If any doubt
could rise as to its position in the universe, the con stellation of the Great Bear in its top would suffice to remove it. 2

So in the Algonkin myth the tree of the dead was a sort of oscillating log for the deceased to cross the river by, as a bridge of the abyss, beyond which the Dog, as in the Persian mythos, stands waiting for the souls of the dead, just as the Dog stands at

plants which play so important a part in the history of religious and scientific credulity. Should any reader thereof be inclined to claim that &quot; the progress of science &quot; has forever done away with such igno rant mediaeval mystagogy, he will do well to turn to The Weekly InterOcean, Chicago, Dec. n, 1884, in which, in an illustrated article enti
tled &quot; The Tree of Life,&quot; we are informed that &quot; science has now dis covered in a most unexpected manner both the Tree and the River
of Life.&quot; The former is the brain and spinal cord of man. &quot; We do not mean that the brain merely looks like a tree or resembles one ex
ternally. We are not dealing with analogies. But we do mean that the brain and spinal cord are an actual tree. By the most rigid scien tific examination it is shown to fill the ideal type and plan of a tree
more completely than any tree of the vegetable kingdom. The spinal cord is the trunk of this great tree. Its roots are the nerves of feel ing and motion branching out over the body. . . . The Tree of Life is planted in the midst of many others, for the heart is a tree, the lungs are a tree, and the pancreas, stomach, liver, and all those vital organs. The brain is its radiant and graceful foliage. The mental faculties are classified in twelve groups by the most recent scientific
analysis. This Tree bears twelve kinds of fruit. . . . On each side of the Tree of Life is the great River of Life. Let us lay a man
down with his head to the north, and his arms stretched to the west and to the east. The River of Life has its four heads in the four chambers of the heart, the two auricles and the two ventricles. The branches of this river pass upward to the head, the land of gold,

eastward to the left and westward to the right arm and lung. But greatest of all the branches, The River, or Phrath, are the aorta and vena cava, reaching southward to the trunk and lower limbs. In branching over the body this river divides into four parts at seven
teen different points. Two branches of the river form a network around the very trunk of the tree, and spread upward among its ex
panding branches. The blood is the Water of Life, and it looks
as clear as crystal when seen through the microscope, the eye of science. It is three fourths water, and through this are diffused the red cells and the living materials which are to construct and to main
tain the bodily organs.&quot; Had this article and its antique-looking illustration been found in one of the Church fathers, it would have af forded to a certain class of &quot; scientists &quot;
great edification.



CHAPTER VII.
THE EXUBERANCE OF LIFE.
And the Lord God planted a garden. And out of the ground made the Lord
God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The Book of Genesis.
Moreover, there were a great number of elephants in the island ; and there was provision for animals of every kind. Also whatever fragrant things there are in the earth, whether roots, or herbage, or woods, or distilling drops offlowers or
fruits, grew and thrived in that land. The Critias of Plato.
Wie verkehrt man ilberhaupt geht, wenn man lediglich aus dem Kreise unsrer jetzigen Erfahrung die Urwelt construiren will, haben uns die paldontologischen Entdeckutigen der neuern Zeit gelehrt, die eben in der Urwelt uns die riesenhaftesten und wunderbarsten Thiergestalten vorfiihren. DR. H. LUKEN.
ACCORDING to all ancient traditions and beliefs, the cradle of the human race was in a portion of the
world characterized by an altogether extraordinary exuberance of life. Of all lands the sun shone upon it was the fairest and best. Even down to the Del
uge, and later, something of the divine goodness of that primeval home-land remained. In the eyes of Plato, the steady deterioration has been going on
from the beginning, the good soil washing down from the heavenly mountains of the earth s summit
and disappearing in the abyss, until,
&quot; in comparison with what then was, there are remaining only the bones of the wasted body, as they may be called, all the richer and softer parts of the soil having fallen away, and the mere skeleton of the land being
left.&quot; J

The deterioration of the climate of the motherregion of the race is particularly described in the
first Fargard of the Avesta :
&quot; The first of the good
lands and countries which I, Ahura Mazda, created
was the Airyana Vaejo [Airan Vej,
&quot; Iran the An
cient &quot;] by the good river Daitya. Thereupon came
Angra Mainyu [Ahriman], who is all death, and he counter-created by his witchcraft the serpent in the river, and winter, a work of the daevas. There are [now] ten winter months there, two summer months, and these are cold for the waters, cold for the earth, and cold for the trees.&quot; l So in Fargard second we have a legendary account of the successive migra
tions of the earliest remembered men out of the
original North country &quot; southwards, to meet the sun,&quot; and nearly all commentators ascribe these repeated &quot; southward &quot; movements to the gradual
refrigeration and glaciation of the primitive home in &quot; Iran the Ancient.&quot; 2
The same idea of a perfect primeval climate is found among all ancient peoples. Ovid represents
1 Darmesteter, i., p. 8. Haug, p. 227. It will be observed that the winter and summer here described are the exact counterpart or
&quot;counter-creation&quot; of the original polar day (the growing season) of
ten months, and the original polar night (or winter of rest from growth) of two months. This is another incidental evidence that &quot; Iran the Ancient &quot; was situate at the Pole. 2

the spring, in Saturn s reign, to have been peren
nial. The spring of our world-age is only an ab breviated reminder of that great original. 1 So Lactantius has preserved a fragment of the old ethnic creed when he tells us that only upon the loss of Paradise, darkness and winter came over the earth.2 With this supposed deterioration of soil and cli
mate the deterioration of man kept pace. Hence
ancient writers, with hardly an exception, represent
the men of their own day as far inferior in stature,
in strength, and in longevity to the first progenitors of the race. Hesiod, Aratus, Ovid, Vergil, and Claudian vary somewhat in their accounts of the Golden,
Silver, and later ages of human history, but all
agree in representing the men of their time as weak
and puny and short-lived, compared with men of the early ages of the world. Juvenal, in a well-known
passage, alludes to Homer s judgment, and expresses his own :
&quot; Nam genus hoc vivo jam decrescebat Homero,
Terra malos homines mine educat atque pusillos.&quot; 8
Plato, speaking of the antediluvians, says, &quot;For many generations, as long as the divine nature lasted in them, they were obedient to the laws, and well
affectioned toward the gods who were their kins
men ; for they possessed true and in every way great
spirits, practicing gentleness and wisdom in the various chances of life and in their intercourse with one another. ... By such reflections, and by the continuance in them of the divine nature, all that

we have described waxed and increased in them ; but when this divine portion began to fade away in
them, and became diluted too often, and with too much of the mortal admixture, and the human na
ture got the upper hand, they, being unable to bear their fortune, became unseemly, and to him who had
an eye to see they began to appear base, and had lost the fairest of their precious gifts.&quot;

The ancient Indian conception of the world s de
cadence from period to period is given in the &quot; Laws
of Manu.&quot; 2 Of the four great ages of the life of
the present universe, we are living in the last and worst. In the first yuga all men were holy ; in the
present all are utterly corrupt and vile. In the first
they were tall and long-lived ; in each succeeding age they have grown dwarfed and feeble. Similar to the Indian was the Iranian belief as reflected in the Bundahish. Here the duration of
the universe is represented as filling four worldperiods of three thousand years each. During the first of the four all is pure and sinless, but at its close the Evil One declares war against Ahura
Mazda, the holy God, which war is destined to fill
the three last ages. During the first of the three,

ditions of Chaldaea, represents the first men as of
extraordinary stature and strength, and as retaining in lessening degree these characteristics until some generations after the Flood. 1 &quot; Among the Egyp
tians,&quot; says Lenormant, &quot; the terrestrial reign of the god Ra, who inaugurated the existence of the world
and of human life, was a Golden Age, to which they
continually looked back with regret and envy : to assert the superiority of anything above all that im agination could set forth, it was sufficient to affirm that * its like had never been seen since the days of the god Ra. The same idea is found again in the Egyptian account of the succession of the terres
trial reigns of the gods, the demi-gods, heroes, and men, as collected from the fragments of Manetho, and corroborated by the testimony of native texts.&quot; 2
In China, too, the catholic ethnic faith in a primeval
Golden Age was not lacking, so that everywhere
the eldest traditions be they Shemitic, Aryan, or
Turanian support, confirm, and illustrate the rep resentations of the Bible touching the extraordinary pristine vitality of Edenic nature and of antedilu vian man. So overwhelming is the evidence that this universal belief of antiquity is a reminiscence of
primitive reality, that one who expressly disclaims a personal belief in the superior stature of the early
men nevertheless asserts that &quot; the universality of
the popular belief attests its very ancient origin,&quot;
and adds that &quot;it may unhesitatingly be ranked
among those originating at a time when the great
civilized peoples of a remote antiquity, still cluster

ing about the cradle of the race, enjoyed a contact
sufficiently close for some common traditions.&quot; 1
The bearing of this unanimous verdict of ancient tradition upon the problem of the location of Eden is obvious. The traditions of the whole ethnic world, not less than the record in Genesis, require that the cradle of the race be placed in the one spot
on earth where the biological conditions are the
most favorable possible. According to all procur able data, that spot at the era of man s appearance
upon the stage was in the now lost &quot; Miocene conti nent,&quot; which then surrounded the Arctic Pole. That
in that true, original Eden some of the early gener
ations of men attained to a stature and longevity
unequaled in any countries known to postdiluvian
history is by no means scientifically incredible. On the contrary, the exceptional biological conditions of that land and the remarkable consensus of all
tradition respecting the vigor of early giant races combine to form a fresh illustration of the principle that the more incredible things an hypothesis ex
plains, the more irresistibly credible the hypothesis itself becomes.
1 Lenormant, Beginnings of History, p. 354. The author con tinues, &quot; To-day we have scientific proof that such belief [in the ex traordinary stature of the early men] has no real foundation, but is simply a product of the imagination.&quot; But his alleged scientific
proof is purely negative, consisting of the fact that the human skele tons which paleontologists have so far found none of which arefrom
the high North are only of ordinary size. &quot; As far back as we can
trace the vestiges of mankind, up to the races who lived in the Qua ternary period side by side with the great mammifers of extinct spe cies, it may be proved that the medium height of our species has
never exceeded its existent limits.&quot; If other early species of mam
mifers were gigantic in comparison with their nearest living repre sentatives of to-day, why may not the mammifer man have illustrated the same law ?



THE EXUBERANCE OF LIFE. 285
Back in that far-off foretime, even in the lower
latitudes, life was remarkably luxuriant. The pale ontologists almost exhaust the resources of language in the effort to describe it. Thus, on a single page,
Professor Alleyne Nicholson, of St. Andrew s Uni
versity, says :
&quot; The life of the Miocene period is
extremely abundant, also extremely varied in its char acter. . . . The marine beds have yielded numerous remains of both vertebrate and invertebrate sea-ani mals, . . . an enormous number of plants. . . . The
remains of air-breathing animals are also abundantly found. . . . The plants of the Miocene period are
extraordinarily numerous. . . . The plant - remains . . . indicate an extraordinarily rank and luxuriant
vegetation,&quot; etc. 1 Figuier gives the following illus tration : &quot;The Lycopods of our age are humble
plants, scarcely a yard in height and most commonly creepers ; but those of the ancient world were trees
of eighty or ninety feet in height.&quot;
2 But we have before seen that the mother - region of all these abounding and varied floral and faunal types was within the Arctic Circle, and from their amazing ex
uberance in low latitudes we may form some concep
tion of the yet superior potencies of life which were at work in that more highly favored circumpolar seed-plot of the whole earth.
In our last chapter it was suggested that the Tree in the midst of Paradise may have been as lofty as
one of the giant Sequoias of California. The com parison was not made at random. In the Miocene remains in Britain, conifers are especially numerous.
And &quot; the most abundant of these is a gigantic pine,
1 Ancient Life-History of the Earth. New York ed., 1878 : p. 308.

286 PARADISE FOUND.
the Sequoia Couttsicz, which is very nearly allied to
the huge Sequoia gigantea of California. A nearly allied form, Sequoia Langsdorfii, has been detected
in the Hebrides.&quot; 1 From the latitude of the Se
quoia grove in Mariposa County, California, to that of the Hebrides is a long stride toward the Pole ; but we are not left to mere inference when we raise
the question whether the original starting-point of this gigantic tree-species may not have been still
higher in the Arctic regions. The Miocene fossils of the highest attainable Arctic latitudes tell their own story. Limited as have been the explorations among these fossils, as Sir Charles Lyell remarks, &quot; more than thirty species of Coniferae have been
found, including several Sequoias allied to the gigan tic Wellingtonia of California. . . . There are also
beeches, oaks, planes, poplars, walnuts, limes, and even a magnolia, two cones of which have lately
been obtained, proving that this splendid evergreen not only lived, but ripened its fruit, within the Arc tic Circle. Many of the limes, planes, and oaks were large-leaved species, and both flowers and
fruits, besides immense quantities of leaves, are in
many cases preserved. . . . Even in Spitzbergen, within 12 of the Pole, no less than ninety-five spe
cies of fossil plants have been obtained.&quot; The vigor
of the vegetable life of the Miocene age in these
Arctic regions impresses the veteran geologist as
&quot;
truly remarkable.&quot;
We have a right, then, not only to draw a conclu
sion from the &quot;abundant&quot; and &quot;
extraordinarily rank and luxuriant vegetation&quot; of the Arctic regions in Miocene time, but also to learn a special lesson from

the gigantic forms which linger on our Western coast. Had the book of Genesis described one of the trees of Eden as three hundred and twenty feet in height and thirty feet in diameter at the base, not only all the Voltaires of modern history, but also until the discovery of California all naturalists of the advanced anti-Christian variety, would have made no end of sport over the unscientific or mythical
&quot; Botany of Moses.&quot; But the Sequoia gigantea is a
living, indisputable fact. Though not the oldest of the Coniferae, it illustrates some of the earlier possi
bilities of vegetable life. It tells the botanist that growths once realized in great abundance are dying
out, and unless perpetuated by human care are soon to disappear from our globe forever. Its last surviv
ing representatives in the state of nature, preserved to our day by certain fortunate local conditions and
by their own inherent longevity, are witnesses re
specting a far-off world, witnesses whose testimony the most incredulous must accept. They tell of the
far-away dawn of the day of man, they bear testimony to the extraordinary life which characterized their
distant birth-land. 1 And if these last individuals of an expiring race can maintain, under unfavorable
biological conditions, a vigorous life through two mil lenniums of time, who shall declare it impossible that
1 During the Tertiary period the Sequoias &quot;occurred all around the Arctic zone &quot; (Asa Gray). Professor J. D. Whitney finds evidence that one of the fallen trees in Placer County was over 2000 years of age. See his Yosemite Book ; also Engler, Entwickelungsgeschichte der Pflanzenwelt. Leipsic, 1879-82 : chap. i. and ii. It is also note worthy that the Australian Eucalyptus gigantea, the only tree which
surpasses the Sequoia in height, is found precisely in that country whose belated living flora and fauna are more closely related to the northern types of the early world than are any other.



288 PARADISE FOUND.
the men of the time and place of the origination of
the Sequoia gigantea should have averaged more than six feet in stature, or attained to an age quite
surpassing our threescore years and ten ? As to the
latter point, it would require more than the com bined lives of two Methuselahs to watch the growth and death of a single tree like those of California. The thought is not the incubation of the present writer ; it is what the trees themselves said to the foremost botanist of America. 1 But the exuberance of animal life in the Miocene
period is not less remarkable. We quote the same author as before :
&quot; The Invertebrate animals of this period are very numerous. ... The little shells of the Foraminifera are extremely abundant. . . . Corals are very abundant, in many instances forming
regular reefs. . . . Numerous crabs and lobsters represent the Crustacea. . . . Of Insects more than thirteen hundred species have been determined by Dr. Heer from the Miocene strata of Switzerland alone. . . . The Mollusca are very numerous. . . . Polyzoans

Scripture, to hand down to us through a few generations the tradi tions of centuries, and so tell us somewhat of the history of their race. Fifteen hundred annual layers have been counted or satisfac torily made out upon one or two fallen trunks. It is probable that close to the heart of some of the living trees may be found the circle
that records the year of the Saviour s nativity. A few generations of
such trees might carry the history a long way back. But the ground they stand on and the marks of very recent geologic change and vi cissitude in the region around testify that not very many such gener ations can have flourished just here, at least in unbroken series.&quot; Professor Asa Gray, LL.

are abundant. Bivalves and Univalves are extremely
plentiful. . . . The Fishes of the period are very abundant. . . . The remains of Reptiles are far from uncommon. . . . The Land-tortoises make their
first appearance during this period. The most re markable form of this group is the huge Colossochelys Atlas of the Upper Miocene deposits of the Siwalik Hills in India, described by Dr. Falconer and Sir
Proby Cautley. Far exceeding any living tortoise in its dimensions, this enormous animal is estimated as
having had a length of about twenty feet, measured from the tip of the snout to the extremity of the tail, and to have stood upwards of seven feet. . . . The
accomplished paleontologists just quoted show fur ther that some of the traditions of the Hindus would render it not improbable that this colossal Tortoise survived into the earlier portion of the human pe riod. . . . The Mammals of the Miocene are very numerous. . . . The Edentates (Sloths, etc.) are rep resented by two large European forms. One of
these is the large Macrotheritim giganteum. . . . The
other is the still more gigantic Ancylotherium Pentelici, which seems to have been as large as, or larger
than, the rhinoceros. . . . We may also note here the
first appearance of true whalebone Whales, two spe
cies of which, resembling the living Right Whale of the Arctic seas, and belonging to the same genus, have been detected in the Miocene beds of North America. . . . The great order of the Ungulates,
or hoofed quadrupeds, is very largely developed in
strata of the Miocene age, various new types mak
ing their appearance here for the first time. . . . We meet for the first time with representatives of the

noceroses. . . . The family of the Tapirs is repre sented, . . . some of which were quite diminutive in point of size, whilst others attained the dimensions
of a horse. Nearly allied to this family, also, is the
singular group of quadrupeds which Marsh had de scribed under the name of Brontotheridce. These
extraordinary animals, typified by Brontotherium
itself, agree with . . . and differ from the existing Ta
pirs. . . . Brontotherium gigas is said to be nearly as large as an elephant, whilst Brontotherium ingens appears to have attained dimensions still more gigan
tic. The well-known genus Titanotherium would
also appear to belong to this group. . . . The family of the Horses appears under various forms in the Miocene, but the most important and best known of
these is the Hipparion. . . . Remains of the Hipparion have been found in various regions in Europe and in India ; and from the immense quantities of their bones found in certain localities, it may be safely inferred that these Middle Tertiary ancestors of the
Horse lived, like their modern representatives, in great herds. . . . Amongst the even-toed Ungulates we for the first time meet with examples of the Hip
popotamus, with its four-toed feet, its massive body, and huge tusk-like lower teeth. . . . The true Deer,
with their solid bony antlers, appear for the first time here. . . . Perhaps the most remarkable of these Miocene Ruminants is the Sivatherium gigantetim of the Siwalik Hills in India. In this extraordinary animal there were two pairs of horns. ... If all these horns had been simple, there would have been
no difficulty in considering Sivatherium as simply a gigantic four-horned Antelope. ... It is to the Mio
cene period that we must refer the first appearance

of the important order of the Elephants and their
allies (Proboscidians). . . . Only three generic groups of this order are known, namely, the extinct Dei
notherium, the equally extinct Mastodons, and the Elephants ; and all these three types are known to have been in existence as early as the Miocene
period, the first of them being exclusively con fined to deposits of this age. . . . The most cel ebrated skull of the Deinothere is the one which was exhumed from the Upper Miocene deposits of Epplesheim, in Hesse-Darmstadt, in the year 1836. This skull was four and a half feet in length, and
indicated an animal larger than any existing species
of the Elephant. . . . Whilst herbivorous quadrupeds,
as we have seen, were extremely abundant during Miocene times, and often attained gigantic dimen
sions, beasts of prey (Carnivora) were by no means wanting ; most of the existing families of the order
being represented. . . . Weasels and Otters were not unknown, . . . whilst the great Cats of subse
quent periods are more than adequately represented by the huge sabre-toothed Tiger. . . . Amongst
the Rodent Mammals . . . all the principal living groups were differentiated in Middle Tertiary times.
. . . Lastly, the Monkeys existed during the Mio
cene period under a variety of forms. . . . The Dryopithecus is referable to the group of Anthro
poid Apes/ . . . Dryopithecus was also of large size,
equaling Man in stature, and apparently living amongst the trees and feeding upon fruits.&quot; 1

Diprotodon, which &quot; in size must &quot;have many times
exceeded the dimensions of the largest of its living successors, since the skull measures no less than
three feet in length.&quot;
2 Or we might rehabilitate
the &quot; colossal &quot;
Megatherium Cuvieri, whose &quot;
thigh
bone is nearly thrice the thickness of the same bone
in the largest of existing Elephants.&quot; 3 Or, again, visiting the Jurassic beds of our own Colorado, we might contemplate the Titanosaurus, one of the latest discovered of the tenants of the early world,
of which Sir John Lubbock says that it &quot; is perhaps the largest land animal yet known, being a hundred
feet in lengthy and at least thirty feet in height,
1 The fact that fossil remains of these gigantic extinct birds have been found only in the Southern hemisphere militates in no wise
against the doctrine that the species originated in the highest North. For (i) birds are the best equipped of all creatures for migration to
the remotest parts of the earth. (2.) The Connecticut Valley sand stones, in the Northern hemisphere, preserve the tracks of birds &quot;which must have been of colossal dimensions,&quot; the tracks being 22
inches in length and 12 in breadth, with a proportionate length of stride. &quot; These measurements indicate a foot four times as large as that of the African Ostrich.&quot; (3.) These tracks were made in the
Triassic period, while the remains found in New Zealand and adjacent regions belong to the much more recent Post-pliocene period, thus giving a long lapse of years for the spread or migration of the species from the latitude of the Connecticut Valley to that of the most South ern lands. Compare Geikie :

though it seems possible that even these vast di mensions may have been surpassed by those of the
Atlantosaurus&quot; 1 also a late discovery. But why
multiply illustrations ? Natural history in our times
can produce no species of fishes, or of amphibians, or of reptiles, or of birds, or among mammals of marsupials, or of edentates, or of ungulates, or of proboscidians, or of carnivores, or of apes, which in normal dimensions are not excelled by species of
the corresponding orders and classes belonging to
Tertiary and Quaternary ages. And this being so, it is surely possible and credible that in the same antediluvian ages some of the varieties of the spe cies Bimana may have exceeded in stature its pres
ent average, and enjoyed a corresponding vigor of
constitution. At any rate, it will be soon enough
to deny it after human remains of suitable age shall have been found in the vicinity of the race s origin and earlier history. So far as past findings are con
cerned, even Biichner, who holds that &quot;primitive man was inferior even in corporeal attributes to the
men of the present day,&quot; and that &quot; the widely spread belief in the former existence of a race of human
giants is perfectly erroneous,&quot; still has to say,
&quot; It
is true that some very ancient skeletons or parts of skeletons have been found, which must have be
longed to comparatively large and very muscular men, such, for example, as the skeleton of the famous Neanderthal man, and the human bones recently found by M. Louis Lartet in one of the caverns of Perigord, . . . which seem to indicate a rude but
muscular race of men.&quot; 2 Again, speaking of the

skeleton to which the Neanderthal skull belongs, he
says,
&quot; The ridges and crests especially which served as points for insertion of the muscles are very
strongly developed, so that we may conclude that
their possessor was a very strong and muscular man! J It may be added that Carl Vogt, one of the earliest and most influential of Darwin s German
disciples, also conceived of &quot; the man of the oldest
Stone Age &quot; as &quot;of large stature, powerful and long headed! * Here it may be well to remark that the primitive
forms of animals, while often so excelling in size the later forms of their own kind, are by no means
to be thought of as monstrosities. The proportion
of a young child s head to his body is very different from that of an adult s. In comparison with the grown man, his limbs and hands and feet are re
markably plump and well rounded. Had a painter
never seen and studied a human being except in the adult and senescent stage, the infant form would
seem to him singularly abnormal. This illustration
may help to a right judgment of certain early types
of animals. For &quot;if we take the earliest known
and oldest examples of any given group of animals, it can sometimes be shown that these primitive
forms, though in themselves highly organized, pos sessed certain characters such as are now only seen
in the young of their existing representatives. In technical language, the early forms of life in some
instances possess embryonic characters, though this does not prevent them often attaining a size much more gigantic than their nearest living rela

THE EXUBERANCE OF LIFE. 29$
tives. Moreover, the ancient forms of life are often
what is called comprehensive types ; that is to say, they possess characters in combination such as we
nowadays only find separately developed in different
groups of animals. Now this permanent retention
of embryonic characters and this comprehensive ness of structural type are signs of what a zoolo
gist considers to be a comparatively low grade of organization ; and the prevalence of these features in the earlier forms of animals is a very striking
phenomenon, though they are none the less perfectly organized so far as their own type is concerned 1
To put the mistake to be guarded against in another light, it may be said that whoever considers the de partures of the most ancient forms of animal life from the allied living forms as abnormal and mon strous in many cases simply takes the types of de
cadence and senility by which to test and condemn the plumper and fuller and fairer types of physical
juvenility. In like manner, the &quot; comprehensive
&quot;
types can be called monstrous and strange only
as these terms might be applied to the &quot; London
Times &quot;
by a man who in all his life had never seen
any other specimen of journalism than &quot; The North
British Wool-Growers Monthly Bulletin,&quot; or &quot; The Daily Price-Current of the Southampton Associated
Grocers.&quot; What the zoologist calls the &quot;lowest&quot;
forms of organization are rather the highest, if by
&quot;highest

the time of the advent of man was a world of crudi ties and monstrosities a notion to which books
and magazines of popularized science have given an almost universal currency is therefore entirely
false. 1 In the light of profounder science, the fair est Eden of the oldest legend is, so far as primeval zoology is concerned, more credible than when the
study of Paleontology was first begun. It must not be forgotten that in all that has now been hinted respecting the fauna of the early world no account has been taken of more favorable and
less favorable portions of the earth. Paleontologists are but just beginning to consider that between the biological conditions of the Arctic regions and those of every other portion of the globe there must have been, in Pre-Glacial times, the profoundest and most
far-reaching difference. The growths of a region whose day was ten months in length, and whose
night was but two, could not fail to be vastly differ

other biologists does not tend to give geologists much confidence in

the successive appearances of vegetable forms in time and their com

He also adds that the earliest recognizable cryptograms are not only the highest now existing, but have more highly differentiated vegeta tive organs than any subsequently appearing, and that the dicotyledo nous embryo and perfect exogenous wood, with the highest special ized tissue known (the coniferous with glandular tissue), preceded the monocotyledonous embryo and endogenous wood in date of ap pearance on the globe, facts wholly opposed to the doctrine of pro gression.&quot; Sir Charles Lyell, The Antiquity of Man, p. 404.

the plants and shells of the Arctic region are emi

forms and powers of animal life were what we have
seen, who can undertake to depict its superior exu berance and variety of manifestation in that primitive polar focus from which all faunal types proceeded !

the scientific credibility of prehistoric Arctic giants. At the present
day, and in our own latitudes, men occasionally appear whose stature is four or five times the height of the smallest adult dwarfs. Accord ingly, if we were to assume two and one half feet as the minimum
adult stature in polar regions in primeval times, the still prevailing
range of variation would give us in those times some men from seven and one half to twelve and one half feet in height. Possibly new fos sil evidence on this point is soon to be afforded us. The following is going the rounds of the daily press :

says,
&quot; the northern islands of Siberia seem built
up of its crowded bones&quot; * Another scientific writer,
speaking of the islands of New Siberia, northward of the mouth of the river Lena, uses this language :
&quot; Large quantities of ivory are dug out of the ground every year. Indeed, some of the islands are believed to be nothing but an accumulation of drift-timber and the bodies of mammoths and other antediluvian ani
mals frozen together? 2 So full of these remains is the soil of these high Arctic regions that the Ostyaks and other ignorant tribes have an idea that the
mammoth is an underground animal ploughing his way through the earth like a mole, and that he still lives in his subterranean passages. Nor would there seem to be anything so remarkably novel in the
theory we have advocated in this book, according
to which the submergence of the primeval home of mankind and the introduction of the great Ice Age are connected with the Deluge : for when, nearly two hundred years ago, the Russian ambassador, Evert Yssbrants Ides, made his bold, three -year overland journey to China, he in the high North
found and reported this precise traditionary belief. 3
&quot; From this we may infer that during the years that have elapsed
since the Russian conquest of Siberia, useful tusks from more than
20,000 mammoths have been collected.&quot; In a note the same writer expresses the opinion that Von Middendorffs estimate is quite too low, and says that a single steamer on which he sailed up the Yenisej in 1875 was on that single trip taking more than one hundred tusks to

IN Part Second, at the very beginning of our dis cussion, attention was called to the two classes of tests which the hypothesis of an Arctic polar site for Eden must of necessity meet : first, the tests
which would apply alike to all the ordinarily pro
posed sites in temperate and inter-tropical latitudes ; and second, the tests which would be inseparable from the aspects and adjustments of Nature at the Pole. In the first class seven were enumerated, and at the close of Part Fourth we saw how surpris
ingly and convincingly all of the seven had been met. In the second class seven others were par
ticularized as &quot; new features &quot; introduced into the

from obvious and ridiculous failure at each succes
sive point. In the present Part we have now brought
together the facts, or at least a portion of the facts, which go to demonstrate that the hypothesis of a
Polar Paradise, and no other, can meet and satisfy each one of these new and more difficult require ments. Speaking after the manner of the mathe maticians, though of course with due remembrance
of the nature of the reasoning employed, it may be said that we have first solved our problem, and then,
by a new process and with changed elements, proved
and verified our answer. Whoever would see how
strikingly complete and cogent this verifying pro cess is should turn back to the second chapter of Part Second and carefully collate the seven &quot;new features &quot; there enumerated with the facts of the
first seven chapters of the present Part. The result of such a collation upon any candid mind can hardly
be doubtful.
In the writer s firm-grounded conviction, then, LOST EDEN is FOUND. To no one of his readers can its true site be more surprising than it was at first to him. Every antecedent probability seemed
in array against it. First of all, in such problems
every new hypothesis is inherently unlikely in di rect proportion to the number of hypotheses pre
viously propounded and found wanting. Where had more been advanced by the learned and ingen ious than here ? Again, from its nature the hy
pothesis greatly aggravated the conditions and re
quirements of the problem itself. And if, during centuries of discussion, no sublunary site had been found which could meet the simple conditions of
Genesis, how unlikely that with new and far more



302 PARADISE FOUND.
extraordinary conditions added a place could be
found corresponding ! Again, in order to its verifi
cation, the hypothesis required that a wholly new in
terpretation of mankind s oldest cosmological ideas and traditions should be propounded and verified,
an interpretation unanimously forbidden by the con
sensus of modern scholarship in almost every de partment of historical and archaeological research.
How supremely unlikely that any such undertaking could be crowned with success !
Happily, human events do not fall out according to our short-sighted human likelihoods. Even the
thoughtless man sees it, and exclaims, &quot; It is always the impossible that happens !
&quot; The more reverent
soul, who discerns in all history a higher than hu
man agency, and in whose eyes Nature itself is supernatural, must least of all be daunted by the
unpromising first appearances of any clue to truth. His conceptions of the actual are larger than those of mere believers in nature, and thereto are ad
justed his conceptions of the probable. Identifying himself with that personal Power which everywhere makes for truth no less than for righteousness, he
is ever expecting the otherwise unexpectable, and for
the same reason ever looking upon each new truth
attained, not as a personal achievement, but simply as one more proof and precious pledge of pupilhood.
In the progress of the studies here summed up many curious things have come to light, one of which may appropriately be mentioned in this place.
Archaeologists are well aware that more than one hundred years ago, in his &quot; Lettres sur 1 Atlantide
de Platon,&quot; 1779, and &quot;Lettres sur 1 Origine des
Sciences,&quot; 1777, the learned and ingenious Jean

Sylvain Bailly advocated the view that the primi tive cradle of civilization was in Siberia, under the
49th or 5oth degree of latitude. In the latter of the works named there occurs a noteworthy passage in
which the author, rhetorically fixing the birthplace of mankind at the very Pole, remarks upon the &quot;sin
gular conformity
&quot; of such a starting-point, both with all the phenomena of civilization and with the
indications of mythology. In the same breath, how ever, as if startled by his own temerity, he reas
sures his readers by announcing that his suggestion
is &quot; only a philosophic fiction,&quot; and that it &quot; lacks
the support of history.&quot;
l Is it too much to say that the support of history has now been furnished ? 2 Though our hypothesis needs no further confir
mation, it would be perfectly easy to develop a new and striking line of evidence from the light which it throws on the origin of the erroneous precon
ceptions which in the past have either perpetually suggested false theories, or else occasioned the con viction that the problem was insoluble. Thus, after what we have learned as to the posture of wor
shipers in all ancient nations, it is easy to under

stand that the primitive Garden &quot; in the Front
country
&quot; must have been in the North. But since
in the Post-Glacial ages this Front-country was naturally associated with the East, and all investi
gators, Jewish, Christian, and Mohammedan, were trying to find some Oriental region of Paradisaic cli mate, with a central Tree and a quadrifurcate River by which the primitive Gan-Eden might be identi
fied, we have in this preliminary misconception rea son enough for their failure age after age.
Again, in reviewing the results of the theologians, we saw that not a few of the more modern had, like
Luther, been repelled and disgusted by the appar ently senseless and contradictory representations of the earlier fathers and church-teachers, in some of
which Paradise was placed in heaven, and yet appar ently on earth, and anon perhaps midway between heaven and earth ; as high, in fact, as the moon. In view of such representations we cannot be sur prised that a keen-witted satirist like Samuel Butler,
in enumerating the rare accomplishments of Hudibras, should have said,
&quot; He knew the seat of Paradise, Could tell in what degree it lies ; And, as he was disposed, could prove it Below the moon, or else above it.&quot;
Our study of the prehistoric Paradise-mountain,
standing upon the earth at the Arctic Pole and lift
ing its head &quot; to the orbit of the moon,&quot; brings in
stant light into all this confusion. The mountain is
at once in heaven and on earth. And it is interest

traced this conception to just that apostle who, ao

cording to ecclesiastical tradition, as special
&quot; Apos
tle of India,&quot; had best opportunity to learn of the
East-Aryan Meru, and to report this peculiar and
venerable tradition of Paradise. 1 Moreover, as we have seen, there were in several Asiatic religions
two Paradises, a celestial and a terrestrial, con nected by a pillar, or bridge, up and down which holy souls could pass. When, therefore, an ancient writer is found alluding in one place to Paradise as on earth and in another to Paradise as in heaven, the confusion is not in his own mind, but merely in that of his reader.
Here, too, a good word can be put in for poor
Cosmas Indicopleustes, the man who has had the
honor of being more ignorantly and contemptuously
abused by modern scientists than any other cos
mographer of early Christian ages. Doubtless it is easy to ridicule his rude representation of the uni verse, but who will assure us that, thirteen or four teen centuries hence, it may not be equally easy to ridicule the speculations of Herschel as to the form of the Cosmic Whole ? However this may be, the
foregoing chapters have given a new significance to
the thought of the monk &quot; who sailed to India,&quot; showing us that his &quot; Mountain &quot; to the North of the known countries of his day was none other than
Mount Meru, the legendary heaven-supporting cul mination of the Northern hemisphere. His loca tion of Eden, so far as the verdict of science is
yet rendered, is at least as well supported as Hackel s

If our conclusions are correct, Cosmas was the ear liest known geographer who gave to the Christian world a true account of the original seat of the postEdenic antediluvian world. Thus those who have
so long made him their pet illustration of the igno rance and unscientific spirit of &quot; Christian &quot; teach

praise.
The same principles which explain the strange
world of Cosmas explain also the strange conception of the Earth which we found in the letters of Colum
bus. According to this latter, it will be remem bered, the historic hemisphere was true to the
spherical figure, but the hemisphere of his far West explorations rose to a lofty eminence at the equator, in what he supposed to be Asia, but which after wards proved to be the northern part of South America. This gave to the Earth the figure shown
in the adjoining cut, a figure which he compared to that of a nearly round pear. 3 At first view this con

centre of the habitable hemisphere ; the other was conceived to be covered with water. Out of this
ocean the mountain of the poet s Purgatory rises up, like the Peak of Teneriffe, from the bosom of the
waves, and is exactly opposite to Mount Zion, so that the two become the antipodes of each other. The mathematicians in their measurement of Dante s Hell proceeded in this wise : An arc of thirty de grees was measured from the meridian of Jerusalem westward as far as Cuma, near Naples, and here, at the Fauces Averni of Vergil, it pleased them to locate its dreary entrance. Another arc of thirty degrees was next measured from the same meridian
eastward, so that both together made up a portion of the earth s circumference of about 4330 English miles, the chord of which would be equal to its semidiameter. This was made the base of their opera tions, so that with the world s centre for its apex . . . the Inferno became as broad as it was deep. At this centre of gravity, firmly wedged in everlast ing ice, the grim monarch of these dolorous realms
is placed.&quot;

REVIEW OF THE ARGUMENT. 309
Upon the correctness of &quot; the mathematicians &quot;
above mentioned, the present writer is not prepared to pass judgment, 1 but no careful reader of the Divine
Comedy can fail to see that its &quot; Mount Zion &quot; and
the Purgatorial
&quot; Montagna malagevole, altissima et
cinta de mare! are simply unrecognized &quot; survivals&quot;
of prehistoric thought, antipodal world-mountains once situate at the poles, but here relocated to suit the demands of sacred mediaeval cosmology. They are the Su-Meru and Ku-Meru of India figuring in Christian poetry. In Lord Vernon s illustration of this curious cosmos, a Hindu pundit would almost
certainly think he had a Puranic mappe-monde? That after the Paradise-mount has thus declined, first to the latitude of Central Asia, then to the
equator, and finally to the pendant position in which Lord Vernon places it, directly under the City of
God, with a hypogene central Inferno between, that after such translocations it should so long have eluded the recognition of all Paradise- seekers is
surely little wonder. 3
1 Dante s instructor in the natural sciences was Brunetto Latini,
who was born A. D. 1230 and died 1294. He is paid an affectionate
tribute in the Inferno, xv. 85. He wrote a work of which Li Livres dou Tresor, Paris, 1863, is an Old-French edition. In it (lib. i., part iii., c. v.) the author ably advocates the doctrine of the spher ical figure of the earth. Dante s references to the author and to his work have been carefully collected and presented in a learned paper in the Jahrbuch der Deutschen Dante - Gesellschaft, Bd. iv., pp. 1-23. 2 See the &quot; Figura universale della Divina Commedia,&quot; p. xxx. of
vol. i. of L Inferno di Dante Alighieri da G. G. Warren Lord Vernon. London, 1858. 3 Flammarion s picture (Myths of Astronomy, p. 311) corresponds quite closely to Lord Vernon s, only the exactly south polar position of the mountain is made, if possible, more unequivocal by inserting

Our Arctic Eden, therefore, by explaining the
origin of the cosmological conceptions of ancient Chaldsea and Egypt and India, explains at the same time the origin of the most eccentric and apparently senseless conceptions of mediaeval and modern cos
mographers, and presents what may properly enough be called the philosophy of the errors and misconcep tions and fancies of previous searchers after Para
dise. It is much that an hypothesis meets all the
requirements of a given problem ; it is more that it does this better than any other hypothesis ; it would
seem to be past all question when it so illuminates and enriches the very data of the problem that every
previous solution falls away of itself, the philosophy
of its origin and of its inadequacy being patent and unquestionable.

IF the alleged facts and the conclusions of the
foregoing chapters shall be accepted as correct, it is plain that in finding the true answer to one of the
longest standing and most baffling of the problems of Biblical theology we have at the same time found
one of those central key-truths, acquaintance with which affects a great many other kinds of knowl
edge. Indeed, it is not too much to say that the
acceptance of this alleged truth upon its appropri ate evidences, must affect men s estimate of the sources of knowledge. For if the sacred traditions
of mankind, when once rightly interpreted, are dis covered to be in astonishing harmony with each other, and to yield results which our most advanced
sciences, working in the most varied fields of re
search, singularly conspire to verify, this discovery cannot fail to give new significance to history in all

its departments and in all its teachings. But apart from this general effect of a verification of ancient testimony, our precise conclusion as to the location
of the cradle of the human race has a most evident
and important connection with all physical, paleon
tological, archaeological, philological, mythological, ethnological, and &quot; culture-historical &quot;
speculation, in a word, a most evident and important connection with about every problem which in a marked degree attracts and occupies our modern thought. 1 In the present Part it is proposed to notice the relation of our facts and conclusions to a few of these fields of
study, and first of all, in the present chapter, their
bearing upon the study of biology and terrestrial
physics. In Part Third and in the seventh chapter of Part Fifth and elsewhere, we have already had various
illustrations of the fascinating and authenticating light which the biological sciences can throw upon
the study of prehistoric traditions. Possibly the
reader, if devoted to this kind of study, has won dered why a field of illustration so rich has not
oftener been utilized by writers upon antiquity.
But however important this bearing of biological upon prehistoric studies may be, it should not be
forgotten that the counterpart bearing of the study

of the earliest traceable thoughts and beliefs of mankind upon biology and upon the most fruitful
study of biology is not a whit less important. This
is a point of utmost moment to the fields of knowl edge concerned and also to the general theory of
personal and organized culture ; yet it is a point most infrequently brought under the consideration
of thoughtful readers. It is an unfortunate and ominous fact that the aver
age biologist of the present day sees nothing worthy of his professional attention back of the present cen tury. The intellectual history of the human race has not the slightest interest for him or value for his work. Ages on ages of human observation and
thought and speculation touching the problems of life are to him as if they had never been. If he ac
quaints himself with them in the slightest degree, it is usually only for the sake of amusing his hearers with what he considers the grotesque and absurd ideas of former times, and impressing them with the contrast which latter-day
&quot; science &quot;
presents. For all that his race has done until just before his own immediate teachers began, he has little more than
pity and contempt. Now, in any department of human learning, such an attitude of mind is certainly to be deplored. Its effects are detrimental in every aspect. In propor
tion as it prevails among any class of intellectual workers, in just that proportion does that class be
come isolated from the one collective and historic
intellectual life of humanity. In this way the col
lective intellectual life suffers, and yet more do the isolated workers suffer. Humanity, conscious of an
intellectual history, naturally comes to pay little

attention to these men who deny it, or take no in
terest in it. On the other hand, any class of men
who ignore the history of the human mind and be gin all true history and all true science with their
own achievements, by this very procedure place themselves outside that spiritual fellowship in which all forms and fragments of knowledge find unity and
mutual supplementing. The circle of their intellect, ual sympathies and tastes is narrowed. With the loss of broad sympathies and tastes they are in dan
ger of losing even the capacity to discern and appre ciate any kind of truth outside the limited range of
their own specialized field of professional research.
So far has this perilous tendency already gone that it is a difficult thing in any country to find a cele
brated biologist whose publicly advocated theory of
education for his own field of labor does not quietly
ignore, or actively antagonize, the broadening his
torical and humanistic studies which alone can qual
ify a man for intelligent sympathy with all good learning. Unless the tendency can in some way be checked, there is positive danger lest the special cultivators of biology and the natural sciences be come as narrow and isolated and influenceless a
guild of experts as are the antiquarian-catalogue makers of modern Europe. 1
1 A few years ago Mr. John Stuart Mill, in an address before a Scotch university, put forth a defense of the claims of classical stud ies to a place in the regular university curriculum. For this one crime he was recently editorially assailed and vilified through several columns of an American organ of natural science, and despite the fact that he was notoriously a disbeliever in Revelation, and was a professed admirer of Comte s atheistic evolutional sociology, the dreadful charge is brought forward :
&quot; He was in the Golden- Age, Paradise-Lost dispensation of thought, in which the notions of the early perfection of mankind and the superiority of the ancients were

In studies like the one which has thus far en gaged us lies the best possible corrective for this
one-sidedness. In this field are found stimulation for the student s curiosity, facts for his understand
ing, arguments for his reason, play for his imagina
tion. And all the time his study of Nature and his
study of Man are mutually helpful to each other.
He now has Nature and her life before him in two forms : first, as she has entombed herself in the great
cemetery of the rocks ; and secondly, as she has pic
tured herself in historic and even prehistoric human
thought. If the former gives her with greater tan
gibility, it is only the tangibility of the mouldering skeleton. It is the latter which shows her alive
and filled with all life s meanings. Each is impor
tant in its place, both being reciprocally corrective
and mutually complementary.
As yet the biologist has not profited by ancient conceptions of Nature as he should have done.
How long and slow has been the progress of the botanist up to this latest conception that all the life
forms of the vegetable kingdom proceeded originally
from one centre, and that at the Pole ! The ancient Iranian myth of &quot; the tree of all seeds,&quot; from which
proceeded &quot; the germs of all species of plants

ever grew, and which, moreover, was located at the

tion,&quot; Popular Science Monthly, New York, 1883, p. 703. Such natu
ralists are too unlettered to know their own party leaders, or to be aware of the fact that it is precisely to biology that Mill pays the splendid tribute of declaring that among all departments of human knowledge it &quot; affords as yet the only example of the true principles
of rational classification.&quot;

North Pole, ought long ago to have suggested to him the truth as to the genetic unity of the vegeta ble kingdom and also as to its pristine centre of dis
tribution. The same may be said of the zoologist and the suggestiveness of the myths of the same
people respecting
&quot; the primeval ox &quot; and the Gosh,
&quot; the personification of the animal kingdom.&quot; 1 In these survivals of ancient culture we have the forms
in which prehistoric zoology expressed the unity, the monogenesis, and the north polar origin of the entire fauna of the earth.
It is now, perhaps, too late for the biologist to gain from these particular myths the instruction
which generations ago they could have given him. By slower and more painful methods this beautiful
polocentric conception of the vegetable, animal, and
human worlds has at last been reached. The prob lems of earliest floral and faunal and ethnic distri
bution have shut men up to its acceptance. But if the discovery of the accordant significance of these
ancient myths has been equally delayed, we may at least indulge the hope that the unexpected agree ment of the prehistoric conception with that of
latest science will inspire in candid students of Na ture a new and higher respect for the primeval teach ings and beliefs of mankind. Meantime let it not be forgotten that there are other myths, of equal
antiquity and possibly of wider prevalence, the sig nificance of which for the progress of biology may to-day be as great as ever was that of the tree of all
seeds. Notice, for example, this curious fact : that while in ancient East Aryan thought the gods on Mount

Meru are of prodigious stature the proper tenants of
the adjacent regions are somewhat less, though still
gigantic ; and they seem to dwindle regularly in size from Varsha to Varsha, until we reach Bharata, the Varsha which borders upon the equatorial ocean
and is peopled with ordinary men. And as if the inhabitants of Hades, being still farther to the South, must be by some law of nature still smaller than men, Prince Satyavan s soul, when led away to
Yama s abode, is described in the Mahabharata as
only &quot;a thumb in height.&quot; A striking gradation, every one will say. Beginning with beings some times represented as miles in height, it ends on the borders of the Land of Death with disembodied spirits whose stature is only a thumb s length. But
this conception of the range of the kingdom of gen erated and mutable life was not limited to the an cestors of the Hindus. In the most ancient Greek thought the proper habitat of the Pygmies was near the equatorial Ocean-river ; farther northward was the abode of men ; still farther proceeding, one came
into the region of giants ; while in polar Olympos the gods were so colossal that in his fall prostrate
Ares &quot;covered seven acres.&quot; 1 Traces of the same
remarkable adjustment are found in other mytholo
gies. 2 Possibly this far-off prehistoric conception has some significance, some lesson for the biology
of to-day.

forms, excepting so far as representatives of the Mollusca and Brachiopoda are concerned ; and it is remarkable that amongst the deepsea Mollusca no representatives of the Nautilidce and Ammonitidat so excessively abundant in ancient periods, occur, and that Lingula, the most ancient Brachiopod, should occur in shallow water only.&quot; Professor H. N. Moseley, F. R. S., Biological Address before British

Principal Dawson recently remarked :
&quot; It is not
impossible that in the plans of the Creator the con tinuous summer sun of the Arctic regions may have been made the means for the introduction, or at
least for the rapid growth and multiplication, of new and more varied types of plants.&quot;

never dreamed of in our lower zones. Here we have

&quot; The Genesis and Migration of Plants,&quot; in The Princeton Review,
1879, P- 292. 2 The following, from a recent newspaper, suggests some of the new lines of desirable investigation : &quot; The Norwegian plant-geographer, Schubeler, a short time ago called attention to some striking and surprising peculiarities mani fested by vegetation in high latitudes, which he ascribed to the inten
sive light-effects of the long days. Most plants in these regions pro duce much larger and heavier seeds than in lower latitudes. Grain is heavier in the North than in the more Southern latitudes ; the in crease of weight being due to the assimilation of non-nitrogenous substances, while the protein products have no part in it. The leaves of most plants grow larger in the higher latitudes, and at the same time take on a deeper, darker color. This fact has been observed not only in most of the wild trees and shrubs, but also in fruit trees and even in kitchen-garden plants. It has further been observed that the flowers of most plants are larger and more deeply colored, and that many flowers which are white in the South become in the far North
violet.&quot;
So potent and irrepressible are the powers of life in highest Arctic latitudes that neither darkness nor the indescribable cold avail against them. The algic flora well illustrates this statement. Ac
cording to a writer in Nature, Oct. 30, 1884, nearly all Arctic algae live several years, and, in order that they may be able to effect the
work of propagation and nourishment, their organs are in operation during the dark as well as the light season. Whilst wintering at the
northernmost part of Spitzbergen in 1872-73, Professor Kjellman
observed, in the middle of the winter viz., at a time when the sun was lowest, and the darkness, therefore, most intense that a considerable development and growth of the organs of nourishment
took place, while, as regards the organs of propagation, he found that 21

a tension and a direction of terrestrial magnetism
with whose biological significance we are utterly unacquainted. Here we have electric forces which
pour their currents through every grass-blade, and tip the very hills with lambent flame. 1 Shall not
such absolutely exceptional biological conditions and energies be found to yield some exceptional biological result ? Is not this a more hopeful field for the study of the origin of life than the dark and almost congealed recesses of the deep sea ? The old
theologians were accustomed to call Adam and Eve
it was just at this season that they were most developed. Spores of all kinds were produced and became mature, and they developed into splendid plants. The Arctic algae, therefore, present the re markable spectacle of plants which develop their organs of nourish
ment, and particularly their organs of propagation, all the year round, even during the long Polar night, growing regularly at a temperature of between 1 and 2 C., and even attaining a great size at a temperature which never rises above freezing-point. As to &quot; motherregion,&quot; the result at which Professor Kjellman arrived was that the algae flora of the Arctic Ocean is not an immigrant flora, but that its
origin lay in the Polar Sea itself. This theory is, he believes, proved by the fact that the Arctic algae flora is rich in endemic species. There are many species found both in the Northern Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans, a large percentage of which reaches very far north in the Arctic Sea, and which have attained a high degree of develop ment there, being characteristic algae of the Arctic Ocean ; and that
these species have been originated there, and gradually spread to the
other two oceans is, as he believes, more than probable. How little our zonal diversities of climate affect the question of the possibility of a universal distribution of a north polar flora, or even fauna, is well illustrated in the following :
&quot; A remarkable fact associated with the ocean temperature is that forms of animal life belonging to the Arctic seas have been dredged up from the Antarctic Ocean at
depths of two thousand fathoms, and may have passed from pole to pole through the tropics [in deep-sea currents] without having been subjected to a greater variation of temperature than some five degrees or to.&quot; Gen.

the &quot;Protoplasts;&quot; in their ancient polar home it is possible that science may yet discover the divine
secret of all &quot;protoplasm&quot;
Again, our new interest in one of the terrestrial
polar regions gives fresh significance to the con trasts between the two. 1 Within ten years our most eminent American geologist has said,
&quot; I find no
explanation in the present state of science, where fore most of the dry land of the globe should have been located about the North Pole, and of the water about the South. Physicists say that it indicates greater attraction and therefore a greater density in the solid material beneath the southern ocean. But why the mineral ingredients should have been so gathered about the South Pole as to give the crust
there greater density is the unanswered query. It
may be that magnetite is much more abundantly diffused through the Antarctic crust than the Arctic.
This is only one of many possibilities, and it is at present without a satisfactory fact to stand upon beyond the general truth that iron was universally
present.&quot;
2
But the diversity of the two Poles is as great and
as perplexing to the biologist as to the physical
geographer. &quot; The researches made show that the two polar regions differ greatly. The seas of the

Arctic teem with animal life. Land animals, such
as the bear, wolf, reindeer, musk-ox, and Arctic fox, are scattered over the frozen surface of the land where they find the means of sustenance. The air is peopled with innumerable flocks of birds ; a hardy vegetation extends close up to the Arctic Circle, and
beyond it, in mosses, lichens, scurvy-grass, sorrel, small stunted shrubs, dwarfed trees, and in summer beautiful flowers. In the Antarctic, on the con
trary, vegetation ceases at a certain limit, trees ter

abounds in the seas, but though birds exist in great numbers and in varieties unknown in the Arctic,
no quadrupeds are found upon the land.&quot; l
With this we may compare the already cited lan

and seaweeds.&quot; 2
Would it not seem as if the South Pole must have been covered by &quot; the barren sea &quot; at the
period when floral and faunal life, starting at its
Arctic centre, began its conquering marches over all the Earth ? Or is there rather some marked difference in the biological value of the poles them selves ? 3

atic study of Terrestrial Physics.1 Herein lies a fresh and novel impulse to reinvest on every side the still uncaptured citadel of the Arctic Pole.
Long ago could Maury write, &quot; As science has ad
vanced, men have looked with deeper and deeper longings toward the mystic circles of the Polar
regions. There icebergs are framed and glaciers launched ; there the tides have their cradle, the whales their nursery ; there the winds complete their circuits, and the currents of the sea their round; there the aurora is lighted up, and the trem
bling needle brought to rest ; there, too, in the mazes of that mystic circle, terrestrial forces of occult power and of vast influence upon the well-being of
man are continually at play. Within the Arctic Circle is the pole of the winds and the poles of cold, the pole of the earth and of the magnet. It is a
circle of mysteries ; and the desire to enter it, to explore its untrodden wastes and secret chambers,
and to study its physical aspects has grown into a longing. Noble daring has made Arctic ice and snow-clad seas classic ground. It is no feverish ex
citement nor vain ambition that leads men there. It is a higher feeling, a holier motive : a desire to look into the works of creation, to comprehend the economy of our planet, and to grow wiser and better
by the knowledge.&quot; If such a passion for discovery could be kindled in the presence of the older and more abstract problems, what ought to be the result when to these are added the possibility of solving at least some of the mysteries of Nature s Life, and
the certainty of standing where Human Life began !

CHAPTER II.
THE BEARING OF OUR RESULTS ON THE STUDY OF ANCIENT LITERATURE.
A nd the Greeks, ivho surpassed all men in ingenuity, appropriated to themselves the greater part of these things, exaggerating them, and adding to them various
ornaments which they wove into this foundation in every style, in order to charm by the elegance of the myths. Hence Hesiod and the famed cyclic poets drew their
theogonies, their gigantomachies, their mutilations of the gods, and in hawking
them, about everywhere they have supplanted the true narrative. And our ears, accustomed to their fictions, familiar to us for several centuries past, guard as a
precious deposit the fables which they received by tradition, as I remarked when I began to speak ; and, rooted by time, this belief has become so difficult to dislodge that to the greater number the truth appears like a story told for amusement, while the corruption of the tradition is looked upon as the truth itself. PHILO OF BYBLOS.
SUMMING up the most probable results of all his
investigations, Darwin states as his opinion that man must be considered as &quot;descended from a
hairy quadruped, furnished with a tail and pointed ears, probably arboreal in his habits, and an inhab itant of the Old World.&quot; J
According to Hackel, this Homo primigenius was
a blackish, woolly-haired, prognathous, ape-like be ing, with a long, narrow head. His body was en tirely covered with hair, and he was unable to speak. In reading most fashionable writers upon ancient
mythology and literature, one would think that they conceived of the writers of the Vedic Hymns and the authors of the myths of classic literature as very
early and but slightly developed descendants of this
hairy Homo Darwinius. Thus, according to Mr.

Keary, at the time that the myth of the Cyclops
originated,
&quot; men really believed that the stormy sky
was a being and the sun his eye.&quot;
1 Indeed, it might almost appear, from another passage in the
same book, that at the period when this Cyclopsfaith was reached men had arrived at quite an ad vanced stage as compared with the earlier one, when as yet they knew too little to look up at the sky at all, and had an idea that the branches of the trees
extended quite to heaven. &quot; The power of gazing
upward to heaven,&quot; he says,
&quot; came to us not all at
once, but gradually, through lapse of time. Savages are said scarcely ever to raise their eyes, and their heads are naturally inclined with a downward gaze, so that it must be an effort for them to look at the sky and the heavenly bodies. Primeval man lived upon roots and berries, or on the lesser animals and the vermin which he gathered from the soil, and so habit as well as nature kept his eyes fixed upon the
ground. We need not therefore wonder if, in their half-glances upward, our forefathers had not leisure to observe that the tree-top was not really close against the sky. They may well have deemed that the upper branches hid themselves in infinitely re
mote ethereal regions.&quot;
2
The work which such men make in interpreting
ancient literature and thought is strange enough.
The ascription to Agni of the same supreme wor ship which the bard has just paid to Varuna or Mitra is explained as due to the extreme &quot; shortness of the memory &quot; of early men. 3 Only a knowledge of

a most limited portion of the earth s surface can be conceded to any of the ancient nations. The early Aryans sing of the Ocean and of ships of an hun dred oars, but it must not for a moment be sup posed that they had ever seen or heard of the real
Ocean ; they had simply originated in their imag inations a mythical one. 1 In such hands the im
mortal Iliad becomes merely &quot; a tale of land-battle, the theatre of whose action is limited to the two shores of the ^Egaean, the known world of the
Greek.&quot; 2 Though the Homeric poems betray in va
rious places an acquaintance with astronomy, and
actually name various constellations, yet, when the question is raised as to how the poet conceived of the return of the sun during the night from the West to the East, even Mr. Bunbury silences us,
telling us that in Homer s day nobody had ever
thought of such a question !

Illustrations of this worse than mediaeval igno rance and distortion of ancient thought and language could be multiplied to almost any extent. But as some selection must be made, it may perhaps be best to confine ourselves to three or four points in
a field comparatively familiar to all readers likely to peruse these pages, the field of Homeric cosmol

shall make it plain that those interpreters of Homer whose conceptions of Greek culture are derived from current Darwinistic anthropology rather than from the poems themselves, demonstrate, by the number and character of their exegetical entangle ments, the entire incorrectness of their fundamental
assumption. 1
i. The question just touched upon, the Move ment of the Sun, is as good as any with which to begin, and by which to show the embarrassments
into which accepted interpreters have continually fallen in consequence of denying to the ancients a
knowledge of the spherical figure of the Earth. Opening Keightley, we find the customary asser tion that &quot;according to the ideas of the Homeric and Hesiodic ages the Earth was a round, flat disk, around which the river Ocean flowed.&quot; Then he says that &quot; men, seeing the sun rise in the East and set in the
West each day, were naturally led to inquire how
his return to the East was effected.&quot; He alludes to the fact that &quot; in the Odyssey, when Helios ends his diurnal career, he is said to go under the Earth ;&quot; but he adds that &quot; it is not easy to determine whether the poet meant that he then passed through Tartaros back to the East during the night.&quot; The &quot; beautiful fiction of the solar cup or basin,&quot; he thus describes :
&quot;
If, then, as there is reason to suppose, it was the popular belief that a lofty mountainous
ring ran round the edge of the Earth, it was easy for the poets to feign that on reaching the western

stream of Ocean Helios himself, his chariot and his
horses, were received into a magic cup or boat, made by Hephaistos, which, aided by the current, conveyed him during the night round the northern
part of the earth, where his light was only enjoyed
by the happy Hyperboreans, the lofty Rhiphaeans concealing it from the rest of mankind. They must also have supposed that the cup continued its course
during the day, compassing the earth every twentyfour hours.&quot; Of this fiction, however, Keightley confesses, &quot;neither Homer nor Hesiod evinces any
knowledge.&quot; After quoting various later poets, therefore, he concludes as follows :
&quot; From a con
sideration of all these passages it may seem to fol low that the ideas of the poets on this subject were
very vague and fleeting. Perhaps the prevalent opinion was that the Sun rested himself and his weary steeds in the West, and then returned to the East! l By what passage, however, whether via
the North or underneath the supposed u flat disk &quot;
of the Earth, Keightley makes no further effort to determine.
The difficulty in the way of supposing that in
Homer s thought the nocturnal sun passed under
neath the flat Earth-disk, through Tartaros, back to
the East, is that the poet invariably represents this Underworld as forever unvisited by sunlight. In
view of this, and of the ominous silence of Homer as to any winged cup sailing round the earth to the
North, some interpreters warn us against expecting any consistency of thought in poetry so primitive.2

&quot; Of popular views and conceptions one must not demand con

Schwenck goes so far in this direction as to suggest that the island Aiaie is a creation of the imagina tion in the far West, called forth for the express
purpose of giving the mind a kind of resting-place, where it can leave the sinking Helios without troub ling itself with inconvenient speculations as to how he is to get back to the Orient at the appointed
hour. He says :
&quot; The Homeric poetry could not allow the Sun and the daylight to rest during the night in the Homeric Hades, for in that case Hades would have been illuminated. It therefore supposes an island afar off at the end of the world, where Helios and Dawn, after they have passed over across
the heavens, repose at night, and whence, after this repose, they in the morning again ascend the sky.
An exact explanation as to how they come westwardly to this island and then in the morning rise
in the East lies aloof from the poetry, for in Homer
nothing of systems is to be found, and only each ob ject taken by itself is correct and clear.&quot; l
Assume once a spherical Earth, and all these dif ficulties of the interpreters are at an end. East and West touch each other. Mr. Gladstone, before aban doning fully the flat-earth theory, came as near the truth as he possibly could and not hit it, when,
speaking of Helios, he wrote: &quot;The fact of his
sporting with the oxen night and morning goes far
to show that Homer did not think of the Earth as
a plane, but round, perhaps, as upon a cylinder, and
sistency or completion. They go up to a certain point, apprehend only a part, and this only as it appears at first blush ; they leave one side all conclusive reflection, and are unconcerned about contradic tions since they are not conscious of any&quot; J. F. Lauer in Anhang to

believed that the West and East were in contact.&quot; *
He mistook, however, in suggesting Thrinakia as the place of contact. It was rather on the meridian of Aiaie, for we are expressly told that
Wi r Hows otKia Kal XPl &quot;

&quot; There are the abodes and dance-grounds of Au
rora, there the risings of the Sun.&quot; 2
Nor could anything be more natural than that the
poet, conceiving of the world of living men as
Homer did, and sending out his thoughts eastward
and westward in search of the meeting-place of even
ing and morning, should fix upon the meridian oppo site his own, the very place and only place where his eastward -journeying thought and his westward
journeying thought would of necessity meet. His eastern hemisphere would naturally extend round eastward until it met the edge of the hemisphere
extending round westward. On that farthest off me
ridian, 3 therefore, he made the old day give place to the new, eve to morn. That was the doubtful line on
which Odysseus and his companions were no longer clear :
&quot; where was East and where was West, where Helios went behind the Earth or where he rose
again.&quot;

2. The false assumption that Homer s Earth is flat has created all the noted controversies connected with his representations of the location of Hades. This question has divided Homeric interpreters into
more than a dozen differing camps. Their mutually

contradictory solutions of the problem would be the
laughing-stock of the opposers of classical studies,
were these latter only sufficiently acquainted with the world s scholarship to be aware of their exist ence. To review and solve the question in this place would detain the general reader too long, but in the Appendix, Section sixth, the assertions here made will be found abundantly verified. 3. The same flat-earth assumption is further re
sponsible for all the difficulties which interpreters
have found in representing the Ocean, and in gen eral the Water System of the Earth, in accordance with the Homeric data. These difficulties have been neither few nor small. Four of them we will here notice. And, first, that growing out of the statement that from deep-flow
ing Ocean &quot; flow all rivers and every sea, and all
fountains and deep wells.&quot; 1 Volcker pronounces
this &quot; hard to explain.&quot; He says,
&quot; An immediate in-streaming of the Ocean into the sea can scarcely be meant, partly because sea-water and ocean-water do not unite, partly because Homer knows of no such in-streamings in the Phasis and at the Pillars
of Hercules, and the origination of rivers in this
way would not be thinkable.&quot; 2 Other writers, de
voted to the illustration of ancient thought, seem
not to have stopped to inquire whether rivers flow ing up-stream from the Ocean to the hills were thinkable or not, and have gravely set before the
youthful student diagrams constructed on this plan
as the true representation of Homeric thought !
3
1 Iliady xxi. 196.
3 Homerische Geographic, 49. 1 See the older Classical Atlases. &quot; According to Homer,&quot; says



334 PARADISE FOUND.
A second embarrassing question has been this : &quot;If the Ocean - stream surrounded and constituted the outermost boundary of the Earth-disk, what sus tained the Ocean-stream itself and constituted its further shore ?
&quot; As Volcker says,
&quot; Who on the further side held in the billows of the vast Worldriver, that they did not flow off into the empty
spaces of heaven ? Was it a narrow strip of the inner Earth, or was it formless chaos, or the descend ing rim of the sky, or the inner power of the waters themselves ?
&quot; l Buchholz says,
&quot; By what the Ocean itself was in turn bounded remains unclear. The child-like imagination of the Homeric age contented itself with that confused halbverschwommene con
ception.&quot;
2 The most natural answer, especially from the point of view represented by Buchholz,
who, with Ukert and others, claims that the Ho meric heaven was literally metallic, would seem to be Volcker s third supposition, namely, that the rim of the metallic sky constitutes the outer limit of the Ocean-stream.3 This would correspond, also, with the general notion that the circular disk of the earth &quot; divided the hollow sphere of the universe into two
equal parts.&quot;
4 It would also exactly correspond to
Theodore Alois Buckley, in his translation of the Iliad&amp;gt;
&quot;the Earth is
a circular plane, and Oceanus is an immense stream encircling it, from which the rivers flow inward&quot; of course, therefore, up-hill. 1 Horn. Geog., 49. Compare Keightley : &quot;As it was a stream it must have been conceived to have a further bank to confine its course.&quot; Mythology of Greece, p. 33. 2 Homerische Realien, I. I, p. 55. 3 In his earlier work, Die Mythologie des Japetischen Geschlechtes, Giessen, 1824, p. 60, Volcker distinctly represents this as the ancient Greek conception :

Flach s curious and elaborate representation of the Hesiodic world in his recent work on the Hesiodic cosmogony. 1 Still further it would seem best to ac
cord with Homer s language describing the heavenly
constellations as bathing in the Ocean. On the other hand, however, such a supposition would be
incompatible with the Homeric representation that the farther shore presented a suitable landing-place,
and especially a landing-place situated, like that of Odysseus, in the Underworld. Moreover, it would be incompatible with the current notion that the Homeric heaven was supported upon mountain pillars standing on the Earth inside the Ocean-stream, like
Mount Atlas in western Libya. 2 Again, therefore, the question returns, &quot;Given a flat Earth surrounded by the Ocean-river, what constitutes the farther
shore, and how can the mariner who lands upon it speak of himself as in the Underworld ?
&quot; The
learned Volcker leaves the subject with the unsatis
fying observation, &quot;The poet has not answered our
questions.&quot;
A third embarrassment dwelt upon by the same advocate of the flat-earth theory is that, as he un derstands Homer, Hellas was the centre of the cir cular Earth-disk, and not more than &quot; ten or eleven
days sail
&quot; from the Ocean in any direction ; and
yet the poet makes it eighteen days sail by the shortest route from Ogygia to the land of the Phaeacians, and at least another in the same direction to,

Hellas, and yet Ogygia is the navel or centre of the
sea. &quot;These,&quot; says he, &quot;are insurmountable diffi
culties for him who would measure with the com passes. Rather should we learn from this example what folk-faith and folk-tales are. Where there is no agreement we should not create one by main force. The Earth is circular and Hellas is its cen tre; that was the popular faith. But the situation of the Ocean and the extent of the Earth are at the
same time such fluctuating ideas, and all any way extended voyages seem to the poet to extend to
such a terrific distance, that it may well happen to him to overpass all bounds out in that realm
where were, so to speak, the most terrific of all dis
tances.&quot; 1 Thus the nodding Homer is again caught
in contradiction, and to accommodate his exagger ated and terrific distances even Gladstone at first felt constrained to change the figure of the Earth
disk itself, and to present it as a vast parallelogram more extended from North to South than from East to West. 2 The fourth difficulty involved in the current inter
pretation is that experienced in harmonizing the poet s representations of the Ocean, as commonly
understood, with his representations of the move ments of the sun, as commonly understood. The sun at evening certainly ceases to be visible to men.
According to the Homeric representation he returns to the flowing of the Ocean. 3 His bright light sinks in it.4 At his rising it is also from the Ocean
1 Horn. Geographic, 50. 2 See his map. Comp. Juventus Mundi, p. 493. 8 Iliad, xviii. 240. 4 Iliad, viii. 485.



STUDY OF ANCIENT LITERATURE. 337
that he begins to mount the sky. 1 Yet his setting is also described as a going eTs VTTO yalav, under or
behind the Earth. 2 How now, with a flat circular disk for the Earth, and with a circumfluent Ocean in the same plane, and with an eternally dark and un sunned Hades just beyond the Ocean-river to the
westward, can these data be harmonized ? If we at tempt to conceive of the Sun as literally sinking in the ocean and hiding his light beneath its waters, he
has not gone e?s VTTO yalav, but rather &quot; in under&quot; the
Ocean. Moreover, the old difficulty reappears as to
how he shall get round into the East in time for his
rising again. Furthermore, if he is the whole night concealed under the waves of the Ocean, descending into it in the far West at his setting and ascending out of it in the far East at his rising, how can we
arrange for his rejoicing himself night and morning with his oxen on the island of Thrinakia ? 3 But we cannot abandon this whole supposition, and let the Sun set beyond and behind the Ocean-stream, for that would be in the western Hades, where he never shines. Nor yet, again, can we say that he descends to the surface of the Ocean simply, and then, in his
&quot;
cup,&quot; or otherwise, moves round to the Orient by way of the North, for then, the Ocean being in sub

horizon. On this supposition, too, Hades, just west of the river, would also be equally illuminated. In side the Ocean-stream he certainly does not hide himself in the ground, for that would be incompati
ble with all the passages associating his rising and setting with the Ocean. But if he cannot be con ceived of as setting on the hither side of the stream, nor on the farther side, nor yet as resting on the Ocean, nor yet as hiding beneath it, what possible conception of the matter remains ? All this trouble is the natural result of one false
assumption, the assumption that Homer s Earth is a flat disk, Assume that it is a sphere, and every one of these difficulties vanishes. Then, in caus ing the Sun to descend to the Ocean in which lies Aiaie the poet makes the bed to which the king of day retires the same as that from which in the
morning he rises again. At the same time, from the
poet s standpoint and from the standpoint of the lands inhabited by the poet s countrymen, each set
ting of the Sun was a going &quot; behind the earth,&quot; to
reappear on the opposite side. This view of the movement of Helios solves every perplexity ; and if Homer had the knowledge of the Earth and Heavens
involved in the view, we may be sure he also knew as well as we do in what sense the Ocean is the source of all springs and rivers, and for what reason the equatorial Ocean never runs away for the lack of an ultra-terrestrial shore. 4. The same hermeneutical myopia which has
thus minified and misconceived every feature of Ho mer s cosmography has introduced and maintained the now universal dogma that in the Homeric poems &quot; Olympos is always the Thessalian mountain &quot; of

that name. 1 All our youth are taught that &quot; the
early poets believed that the gods actually lived
upon the top of this mountain separating Macedonia
and Thessaly. Even the fable of the giants scaling
heaven must be understood in a literal sense ; not
that they placed Pelion and Ossa upon the top of
Olympos to reach the still higher heaven, but that
they piled Pelion on the top of Ossa and both on
the lower slopes of Olympos to scale the summit of
Olympos itself, the abode of the gods.&quot;
2 To settle
the question negatively as well as positively, revered German erudition solemnly declares, &quot;The gods of Homer never live in heaven.&quot; 3 Such dogmatism
challenges a fresh investigation of the question. Taking up this subject, Keightley remarks that if we were to follow the teachings of Comparative Mythology we should have to locate the abode of
Homer s gods in the heights of heaven. His lan
guage is :
&quot; Were we to follow analogy, and argue from the cosmology of other races of men, we would say that the upper surface of the superior hemi sphere was the abode of the Grecian gods.&quot;
4 He
goes on to allude to the conceptions of the Scandi navians and some other peoples, and adds, &quot; Hence we might be led to infer that Olympos, the abode of
the Grecian gods, was synonymous with heaven, and that the Thessalian mountain and those others which bore the same name were called after the
original heavenly hill.&quot; It is a pity that the learned author could not have

accepted this very sensible conclusion ; but he did
not. Rejecting the admitted intimations of Com
parative Cosmology, he says, &quot;A careful survey,
however, of those passages in Homer and Hesiod in which Olympos occurs will lead us to believe that the Achaeans held the Thessalian Olympos, the
highest mountain with which they were acquainted, to be the abode of their gods.&quot;
The only passage specially referred to by Keightley, as establishing this view, is the Iliad, xiv. 225 seq., where the language employed is not at all in consistent with the idea that, in descending from the summit of Olympos, Hera descended from the northern sky. More elaborate is the argument of
Volcker,1 but its logical cogency is by no means admissible.
The true Homeric conception of the abode of the
gods is far loftier, grander, and more poetic than
that given us by such interpreters. According to the poet s real representation, that abode is &quot;the
wide heaven,&quot; not the atmospheric heaven, ovpa
voi/ lv aWepi KOL ve^eA^o-ti/, for this is a special posses
sion of Zeus (Iliad, xv. 192) ; it is the upper sky,
1 Homerische Geographic und Weltktmde, pp. 4-20. Copied by Buchholz, Horn. Realien, I. 12. Professor Blackie s reasoning is en tirely subjective :
&quot; In a spiritual religion, like Christianity, the word heaven will always be kept as vague as possible ; in an imaginative
and sensuous religion, like the Greek, it must be localized. A Zeus with human shape and members must sit on a terrestrial seat ; and the only seat proper for him is the highest mountain in the country to which he belongs. Now, as the original seat of the Greeks, when they rested from their long journey by the Caspian and Euxine west ward, was the plains of Macedonia and Thessaly, the necessary local
ity for the throne of the Supreme God and the council of the Immor tals was Olympos, the extreme east end of the long Cambunian range separating Thessaly from Macedonia, to the north of the Peneios and the defile of Tempe.&quot; Homer and the Iliad. Edinburgh, 1866 : vol iv., p. 174.

the celestial dome in which sun, moon, and stars wheel silently around the Pole. To the early Greek,
as to the early Perso-Aryan, it was easy to con
ceive of this celestial dome as a heavenly moun
tain, vast, majestic, of unearthly beauty, and peo
pled with glorious beings invisible to mortals. And
this heavenly mountain he called Olympos. The Thessalian mount, the Bithynian, and all the dozen others of the same name l were sacred only so far as
they symbolized and commemorated their heavenly original. In the Odyssey, xi. 315, it is plain that
Homer speaks of the Thessalian Olympos along with other Thessalian mountains ;
2 but in general he means by Olympos the heights of the northern heaven viewed as the proper abode of the gods. 3 The proofs of the incorrectness of the current
1 Heyschius professed to have knowledge of fourteen mountains
bearing the name of Olympos.
2 To all who deny that heaven was to Homer the abode of the
gods this passage presents insurmountable difficulties. To place
Ossa upon Olympos, then upon Ossa Pelion, in order, by means of the three, to climb up into an abode situated on the top of the under
most of the three, is the problem ! No wonder that Volcker thinks Homer has been overpraised for his knowledge of localities and of the arrangement of mountains :

interpretation appear on almost every page of the Homeric poems. The designation of the gods by the formula ot ovpavov evpw IXOV(TLV occurs twice in the Iliad and sixteen times in the Odyssey, but the ex
pressions &quot; who possess the wide heaven,&quot; in Odys
sey, xix., line 40, and &quot; who possess Olympos,&quot; line 43, are plainly identical in meaning. 1 So in the Iliad, &quot;the immortals who possess the Olympian man

are unquestionably interchangeable phrases. 2 Hence
also &quot; the Olympians,&quot;
&quot; the Uranians,&quot; and &quot; the
Epouranians
&quot; are names of the same beings. 3 In
Hesiod s Theogony the expression ei/ros OA^TTOV, &quot; within Olympos,&quot; occurs no less than three times.4 To translate it according to the current interpreta tion of Homer is to locate the palace of Zeus in the heart of an earthly mountain and to transform the
&quot; Lichtgestalten

One of the most vivid of the pictures of Olympian life in the whole Iliad is that portraying (book xv.
14 ff.) the punishment of Hera by Zeus. In the literal translation of Buckley, it is thus rendered :
&quot; O Hera, of evil arts, impracticable, thy stratagem has made noble Hector cease from battle, and put
his troops to flight. Indeed, I know not whether again thou mayst not be the first to reap the fruits
of thy pernicious machinations, and I chastise thee with stripes. Dost thou not remember when thou didst swing from on high, and I hung two anvils from thy feet, and bound a golden chain around thy
hands, that could not be broken ? And thou didst hang in the air and clouds, and the gods commis
erated thee throughout lofty Olympos ; but stand ing around, they were not able to release thee ; but whomsoever I caught, seizing, I hurled from the threshold of heaven till he reached the earth, hardly
breathing.&quot; Although the words &quot; of heaven &quot; are supplied by
the translator, the contrast required by the expres

sion &quot;reached the earth&quot; compels the supply in
order to make good sense.
In book first Hephaistos gives his own account of
this same hurling out of heaven. He says,
&quot; Be
patient, my mother, and although grieved restrain
thyself, lest with my own eyes I behold thee beaten,
being very dear to me ; nor then, though full of grief, should I be able to assist thee, for Olympian Zeus
is difficult to be opposed. For upon a time before
this, when I desired to assist thee, having seized me by the foot, he cast me down from the heavenly
threshold (/fyAov fco-Treo-ioio). 1 The whole day was I
hurled, and at the setting of the sun I fell on Lem
nos, and but little of life remained in me.&quot;
Nothing can well be plainer than that this whole scene is conceived of as occurring high in the vault of heaven. To locate it on any &quot; many-peaked mountain &quot;
every way embarrasses the imagination.2
Moreover, Lemnos is not situated under Thessa

&quot; Heavenly threshold &quot; is Buckley s rendering of this term, though
he elsewhere distinguishes Olympos from heaven, as in note on book xvi. 364. In ancient cosmology the &quot; door of heaven &quot; was situated at the North Pole of the sky.

&quot;Where now is the end of the rope made fast ?&quot; He immediately adds as his answer, &quot; Ohne Zweifel irepl piov OV\VJU.TTOIO I Without doubt around the peak of Olympos !
&quot; No wonder he places an ex clamation point after such a masterpiece of interpretation. Possibly the French savant, M. Boivin, who to explain Od. t vi. 40 ff., con tended that Homer conceived of Olympos as an inverted mountain, having its snowy top near the earth and its snowless and rainless toots in heaven, caught his idea from Volcker s exegesis of this pas* saee !

Han Olympos, nor could the word Kamrca-ov describe Hephaistos s motion in space from the one to the
other. So irresistible, indeed, is the right inter pretation that Keightley, unconscious of his in
consistency, elsewhere says, &quot;The favorite haunt of Hephaistos on earth was the isle of Lemnos.
It was here he fell when flung from heaven by Zeus for attempting to aid his mother Hera.&quot; l In
like manner Professor Geddes, with a forgetfulness
equally entertaining, writes of Zeus &quot;hurling He phaistos over the celestial battlements&quot; and of his
being &quot;able to draw gods and earth and sea aloft
into the sky.&quot;
2
The not less famous passage in the opening lines of book eighth is even more conclusive :
&quot; Whomso
ever of the gods I shall discover, having gone apart from the rest, wishing to aid either the Trojans or the Greeks, disgracefully smitten shall he return to
Olympos ; or, seizing, I will hurl him into gloomy Tartaros, very far hence, where there is a very deep gulf beneath the earth, and iron portals, and a brazen threshold,3 as far below Hades as heaven is from earth ; then shall he know by how much I
am the most powerful of all the gods. But come,
ye gods, and try me, that ye may all know. Having suspended a golden chain from heaven, do all ye
gods and goddesses suspend yourselves therefrom ; yet would ye not draw down from heaven to earth your supreme counselor Jove, not even if ye labor
ever so much : but whenever I, desiring, should

wish to pull it, I could draw it up together, earth, and ocean, and all ; then, indeed, would I bind the chain around the top of Olympos, and all these
should hang aloft. By so much do I surpass both
gods and men.&quot;
Comment is unnecessary. Until the whole of a thing can be suspended upon and supported by a
part of itself, no interpreter can make the top of
Olympos in this passage signify the top of a moun
tain in Thessaly. 1 If any further evidence can be needed to show that no mountain of earth can meet the requirements
of the language of the Iliad respecting Olympos, it
is surely afforded in the passages already alluded to
where suppliants, addressing the gods as &quot; Olym pian,&quot; are said to stretch forth their hands toward
&quot;the starry heavens.&quot; An example of this is the
following :
&quot; But the guardian of the Greeks, Ge
renian Nestor, most particularly prayed, stretching
forth his hands to the starry heaven : O Father Zeus, if ever any one in fruitful Argos, to thee burn
ing the fat thighs of either oxen or sheep, suppli cated that he might return, and thou didst promise
1 The heroic manner in which Professor Geddes accepts this grave alternative and shifts his own embarrassment to the shoulders of the
poet is somewhat discouraging to interpreters who have an inclina
tion to find a rational meaning in their author. He says,
&quot; The
manner in which this f&amp;gt;iov OvX-ufjuroio is referred to in a concrete form shows that it was not only a visible but [also a] commanding object in the poet s landscape ; so much so that it embarrasses his physical
speculations and conceptions of the Cosmos [sic], since it is made the pin nacle on which the world of sea and land is to be suspended by the golden chain. The piov here, however, must le a part of the veritable

Nor is the language of the Odyssey less opposed to the prevailing interpretation. Here Olympos is
metaphorically spoken of precisely as we speak of heaven :
&quot; For Olympos hath given me grief
&quot;
(iv. 722). Again, in a memorable passage, it is de picted in terms which plainly belong to no sub
lunary sphere: &quot;Thus having spoken, blue -eyed Athene departed to Olympos, where they say is forever the firm seat of the gods ; it is neither shaken
by the winds, nor is it ever bedewed by the shower, nor does the snow approach it ; but a most cloud
less serenity is spread out, and white splendor runs over it, in which the blessed gods are delighted all
their days. To this place Athene departed when she had admonished the damsel.&quot; 2

On p. 65 of his Mythology, Keightley quotes this passage as apparently somewhat inconsistent with his view, but nevertheless renews his assertion that &quot; the Greeks of the early ages regarded the lofty Thessalian mountain named Olympos as the dwell ing of their gods.&quot; Compare Volcker :

So unmistakable is this language and the entire usage of the Odyssey that various recent writers, not emancipated from the traditional view as re
spects the Iliad, have yet perceived and admitted
the identity of &quot;OA.V/XTTOS and the upper ov/mvos in the
former work. Among German scholars, Faesi 2 and Ihne 3 have expressed themselves in this sense, and prominent among the Scotch, Professor Geddes. 4
The latter says,
&quot; There is nothing in the Odyssey which obliges us to think of Mount Olympos.&quot; Tes timony from such a quarter is of course all the more
convincing. In Homeric thought, then, the abode of the gods was where we should antecedently expect to find it, namely, in the heights of heaven. Considered with
reference to the august sovereign of gods and men,

Professor Geddes elaborate argument to prove that &quot; the Olympos of the Achilleid &quot; is &quot; a veri table mountain, and that in Thessaly &quot; is entirely inconclusive. The use of a.y&amp;lt;ivvi(pos no more necessitates a literal interpretation than does a poet s application of the term &quot; snowy &quot; to a living bosom, or &quot;fleecy&quot; to the clouds. So iroXuirruxos proves nothing at all to his purpose, since Euripides never having read the Professor s instruc tive statement, &quot; The epithet TTOXVTTTVXOS, applicable only to mountains, is a sufficient barrier to prevent the identification with ovpav6s

the polar sky-arch was a palace, the royal residence, the Sw/xa or So/xos of Zeus. 1 Viewed with reference to its tints, steel-blue and gold, it was described as
metallic, o-t8^peos, x^A/ceos and TroA^aXKo?, terms which metallic interpreters like Voss and Buchholz and Bunbury have pushed to absolute literalness.2 Con ceived of as an ethereal height, it was pictured as
a heaven - high mount, &quot; snowy

clouds. Then to the climbing imagination, mount
ing height above height in the vain attempt to reach the summit, the mountain became alms (II., v. 367,

TroAvTrrvxos (II., viii. 411 ; xx. 5). This last descrip tion, &quot; the Olympos of many layers, or thicknesses&quot;

Iliad, xviii. 370, comp. with 146, 148. Moreover, Aristotle, or who ever wrote the &quot; Letter of Aristotle to Alexander on the System of the World,&quot; in one passage expressly identifies Ouranos and Olympos, saying that for diverse etymological reasons we call the outermost cir cumference of heaven by both names. See Flammarion, Astronomical Myths, or History of the Heavens, p. 156. Even Volcker, in first lay ing down the thesis which has so misled all his successors (&quot;dass Uranus und Olympus nie als synonym bei Homer gebraucht werden &quot;), frankly confesses that this is &quot; gegen die bisher allgemein
gehegte Meinung ;
&quot; that is,
&quot;
contrary to the opinion hitherto gen erally held.&quot; Homerische Geog., p. 4. With gods of Homeric size,
a single one of whom required seven acres for his couch, the idea of placing the whole Olympian Court and Gotterleben on the sharp, nar row, clearly visible peak in Thessaly is ridiculous. 2 Buchholz (Horn. Realien, Bd. i. i, p. 3) declares the metaphorical interpretation
&quot; zu gekiinstelt&quot; for those early times, and roundly as serts that,
&quot; according to the idea of the Homeric Greek, heaven is

pictures that world-old conception of a firmament, not single-storied, but with heaven above heaven,
to the &quot;third,&quot; or the &quot;seventh,&quot; or the &quot;
ninth.&quot;
These heavens were conceived of by Homer him self as in layers one above another, like the curved
lamincs (TTTVXO.I) of a shield. 1 And what adds to the
fitness of the comparison and to the fitness of the cosmic adornment of Achilles shield is the fact that to the omphalos of a shield there corresponded the central and ever-abiding Omphalos of the Skies.
5. Finally, our larger and more rational interpre tation of Homeric ideas beautifully explains
&quot; the
tall Pillars of Atlas,&quot; and solves the multiform per
plexities of the ruling authorities on this question. In approaching the study of this subject several
questions occur to every thoughtful beginner, the answers to which he can nowhere find. For in stance : How can Homer speak of the Pillars of
Atlas, using the plural, when elsewhere in the early Greek mythology the representations always point
to only one ? Again, if there is but one, and that
in the West, near the Gardens of the Hesperides,2 what corresponding supports sustain the sky in the
East, the North, and the South ? Or, if Atlas s Pillar

273. So a recognition of the fact that the nine subterranean, or south
polar, Mictlans, or abodes of the dead, of the Aztecs were simply
the counterparts of their nine celestial, or north polar, Tlalocans, or
heavens, instantaneously clears up the long-standing difficulties of the interpreters of that mythology. See Bancroft, Native Races, vol. iii.,

is only one of many similar ones supporting heaven
around its whole periphery, how came it to be so
much more famous than the rest ? Or, if Homer s
plural indicates that all of them belonged to Atlas, how came the idea of one Pillar to be so universally
prevalent ? If the support of heaven was at many
points, and at its outermost rim, how could Hesiod venture to represent the whole vault as poised on Atlas s head and hands ? l Again, if it is the special function of Atlas, or of his Pillar, to stand on the solid earth and hold up the sky, he would appear to have no special connection with the sea : why, then9 should Homer introduce the strange statement that Atlas &quot; knows all the depths of the sea &quot;
? This
certainly seems very mysterious. Again, if the office of the Pillar or Pillars is to prop up the sky, they of course sustain different relations to earth and heaven. They bear up the one, and are themselves
borne up by the other. Yet, singularly enough, Ho mer s locus classicus places them in exactly the same
relation to the two. 2 Worse than this, Pausanias
unqualifiedly and repeatedly asserts that, according to the myth, Atlas supports upon his shoulders
&quot; both earth and heaven.&quot; 3 And with this corre
1 Theogony, 747. Moreover, how could one limited being have charge of so many and so widely separated pillars ? &quot; It can scarcely be doubted that the words a/x^is exoutnv, Odyssey, i. 54, do not mean that these columns surround the earth, for in this case they must be
not only many in number, but it would be obvious to the men of a myth-making and myth-speaking age that a being stationed in one spot could not keep up, or hold, or guard, a number of pillars sur rounding either a square or a circular earth.&quot; Cox, Mythology of the

spends the language of ^Eschylus.1 But what sort of a poetic imagination is this which represents a mighty column as upholding not only a vast super
incumbent weight, but also, and at the same time, its own pedestal ? Is this a specimen creation of
that immortal Hellenic genius, which the whole mod ern world is taught almost to adore ? Turning to the authorities in textual and myth
ological interpretation, our beginner finds no help. On the contrary, their wild guesses and mutual contradictions only confuse him more and more.
Volck,er tells him, with all the assuring emphasis of leaded type, that &quot; in Atlas is given a personification
of the art of navigation, the conquest of the sea by means of human skill, by commerce, and the gains of commerce.&quot; 2 Preller instructs him to reject this
view, and to think of this mysterious son of lapetos as a &quot; sea-giant representing the upbearing and sup porting almightiness of the ocean in contrast with
the earth-shattering might of Poseidon.&quot; 3 The clas sical dictionaries only perplex him with multitudi nous puerilities invented by ignorant Euhemeristic scholiasts, stories to the effect that the original Atlas was merely the astronomer who first con
structed an artificial globe to represent the sky ; or that he was a Northwest African, who, having as cended a lofty promontory the better to observe the
heavenly bodies, fell off into the sea, and so gave

name both to the mountain and to the Atlantic Ocean. Schoemann does not profess a positive and
certain understanding of the matter, but suggests
that the mysterious Titan was in all probability &quot;originally a gigantic mountain-god&quot; of some sort. 1 Bryant at first makes Atlas a mountain support
ing a temple or temple-cave, called Co-el, house of God, whence &quot;the Coelus of the Romans,&quot; vol. L,
p. 274. In the next volume, however, he says that
&quot; under the name of Atlas is meant the Atlantians.&quot;
And quoting the Odyssey, he translates thus :
&quot; They
[the Atlantians] had also long Pillars, or obelisks, which referred to the sea, and upon which was deline ated the whole system both of heaven and earth ; d/x^is, all aroiuid, both on the front of the obelisk and on the other sides .

If our investigator asks, as did an ancient gram marian, how Atlas could stand on the earth and support heaven on his head, if heaven was so far removed that an anvil would require nine days and
nights in which to fall through the distance, Paley kindly explains that &quot; the poet s notion doubtless was that Atlas held up the sky near its junction with earth in the far West.&quot; 3 In this case, of course,
a reasonably short giant would answer the purpose. If, after all his consultations of authorities, our youth
is still unsatisfied, and to make a last effort for light turns to the illustrious Welcker, he learns as an im

portant final lesson that when an ancient author
says &quot;heaven and earth,&quot; it is not for a moment to
be supposed that he literally means &quot; heaven and
earth,&quot; and that, if they had remembered this, wri ters on mythology would have spared themselves &quot; a vast amount of brain -racking and ineffectual pro

come of all his researches, may not a beginner well despair of ever getting any knowledge of the mean ing of the myth, if, indeed, he can still imagine it to have had a meaning ?
Here, as everywhere, the truth at once explains and removes all the difficulties which a false and
groundless presupposition has created. Once conceive of the Homeric world as we have reconstructed it, and how clear and beautiful the
conception of the Pillars of Atlas becomes ! They are simply the upright axes of earth and heaven. Viewed in their relation to earth and heaven respec
tively, they are two ; but viewed in reference to the universe as an undivided whole, they are one and the
same. Being coincident, they are truly one, and yet
they are ideally separable. Hence singular or plural designations are equally correct and equally fitting. Transpiercing the globe at the very &quot; navel or centre
of the sea,&quot; Atlas s Pillar penetrates far deeper than
any recess of the waters bed, and he may well be
said to &quot;know the depths of the whole sea.&quot; Or
this statement may have reference to that primordial

Again, the association of Atlas with the Gardens
of the Hesperides, so far from disproving our inter
pretation, actually affords new confirmation, since ^Eschylus, Pherecydes, and the oldest traditions
locate the Hesperides themselves, not in the West, but in the extreme North, beyond the Rhiphaean Mountains, in the vicinity of the Hyperboreans. 2 In fact, there are very strong reasons for believing that these Gardens of the Hesperides were nothing
other than the starry gardens of the circumpolar sky ; that therefore the Hesperides were called
the &quot; Daughters of Night,&quot; and that the great ser
1 Compare the Vedic statement, &quot; He who knows the Golden Reed standing in the waters is the mysterious Prajapati.&quot; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, vol. iv., p. 21. Garrett, Classical Dictionary of India, Art. &quot; Skambha.&quot; Still another explanation is suggested by the Rig-Veda,
x. 149 :
&quot; Savitri has established the earth by supports ; Savitri has fixed the sky in unsupported space ; Savitri, the son of the waters, knows the place where the ocean supported issued forth.&quot; Muir,
Sanskrit Texts, vol. iv., p. no (comp. Ludwig s German version). Ac cording to this, he would be conceived of as knowing the depths of the whole ocean, because its celestial springs are about his head, and its lowest depths at his feet. Since the foregoing was first printed the author has met with the remarkable diagram, published four hun
dred years ago in the Magarita Philosophica, in which Atlas is repre sented as a venerable man, with his feet at the inferior and his head
at the superior Pole of the heavens, precisely according to our inter
pretation. A reproduction of it can be seen in Flammarion, Astro nomical Myths, p. 150. See, moreover, Aristophanes, Aves, 180 foil., for the significant etymology of ir6\os. 2 Preller, Griechische My .hologie, vol. ii., p. 149. Volcker, Mytholo

&quot; was none other than the constella tion Draco, whose brilliant constituent Alpha, the astronomer s Thuban, was, less than fifty centuries ago, the Pole-star of our heaven.1
Once more, our interpretation perfectly harmo nizes the passages which represent Atlas as a heaven
supporter with those which represent him as equally supporting earth. More than this, it reveals the cu
rious fact that Homer s description of the tall Pillars of Atlas identifies them with the axes of earth and
heaven so unmistakably that, in order to blunder
into the common mistranslation of it, it was first
necessary to invent, and get the lexicographers to adopt, a span-new special meaning for the words
d/x,&amp;lt;is ex U/
&amp;gt; a meaning necessitated by no other pas
sage in the whole body of Homeric Greek. Homer s

thought it necessary to locate the Hesiodic one on the edge of the earth where the sky is low. Of Sandalfon, Rabbi Eliezer has said,
&quot; There is an angel who standeth on earth, and reacheth with his head to the door of heaven. It is taught in the Mishna that he is called Sandalfon ; he exceedeth his com panions as much in height as one can walk in five hundred years, and that he stands behind the chariot [Charles s Wain] and twisteth or bindeth the gar

the same Pillar apostrophized in the Egyptian docu ment known as the great Harris Magic Papyrus, in these unmistakable words :

pies would of necessity observe within their own con tracted boundaries. The inconsistencies of igno
rance and of half-knowledge and of an undisciplined,
&quot; child-like &quot;
imagination are therefore to be ex
pected at every step. Even the squarest contradic
tions must not surprise. Indeed, in respect to Ho mer, the learned Sengebusch has actually formulated the universal proposition that the results of investi
gations in different departments of Homeric study &quot;will always be found to contradict each other.&quot; 1
In view of the accepted modern results of investi
gation into Homer s cosmology one is tempted to
justify the proposition, only qualifying it in a mild degree, as follows : The results of all Homeric inves
tigations based upon the assumption that Homer was too &quot;primitive&quot; a man to know where the sun
sets will always be found self-contradictory. Against all such barbarizing misinterpretation of ancient literature it is high time that a protest should be heard. Long enough has the beauty and the breadth of ancient thought, in poetry and myth and even in word-building, been obscured and hid den by this conceited assumption of the modern teacher. It was bad enough when the old gramma
rians, assuming that Homer could have had no idea of other than the nearest waters, mutilated the
grand proportions of the Odyssey to fit the voyag
ings of its hero into the western basin of the Med iterranean, or, worse yet, into the Euxine. 2 But

compared with the currently accepted procedure of scholars, who, brought up apparently on magazines of popular science, and imagining that Columbus
was the first man to whom the idea ever occurred
that the earth is round, approach the study of antiq uity merely as the study of an older department of barbarian folk-lore. Surely it is time to investigate the great creations of ancient mind in a different
spirit. 1 It is nothing short of deplorable to consider the mass of senseless argument and false explana tion annually crowded into the memories of succes
sive classes of academic and collegiate youth, ar guments and explanations which neither to teacher
nor taught have even the poor merit of intelligently illustrating the evils of wrong principles of classical hermeneutics. The discussions and results of the present treatise have at least disclosed a conceivable
beginning of human history, according to which the early generations of men can hardly have failed to acquire that knowledge of the mechanism of the heavens which all the oldest traditions of the race
ascribe to them. 2 And if, in consequence of the

determined by modem astronomers.&quot; Flammarion, Astronomical Myths. Paris, p. 26.



CHAPTER III.
THE BEARING OF OUR RESULTS ON THE PROBLEM OF THE ORIGIN AND EARLIEST FORM OF RELIGION.
The more I search into the ancient history of the world, the more I am convinced that the cultivated nations commenced with a purer -worship of the Supreme Be
ing ; that the magic influence of Nature upon the imaginations of the hitman race
afterward produced polytheism, and at length entirely obscured spiritual concep
tions of religion in the belief of the people . A. W. VON SCHLEGEL.

THERE is another class of investigations of re
markable present interest, investigations lying partly in the anthropological and partly in the theological field of research, on which the discus sions and results of the present treatise have a most
important bearing. They are the questions which
relate to the Origin, the Primordial Form, and the
true History of Religion. Such light is greatly needed at the present time.
As we have seen, all the most ancient traditions of the race represent mankind as having commenced existence in a divine fellowship, and as having lost this holy and blessed estate only through sin. This
view of the Origin of Religion has prevailed from the beginning of traceable history among all nations
of the earth, varying only to such slight extent as
would permit polytheistic peoples to conceive of the



EARLIEST FORM OF RELIGION. 363
primeval divine fellowship polytheistically, and the monotheistic peoples monotheistically. To a monotheist it is significant that several of the ancient
nations, representing widely differing races, as for example the Egyptians, the Persians, and the Chi nese, seem to have been more monotheistic in their
earliest traceable conceptions of religion than in their later and latest creed and practice. But with
out dwelling upon this, it may be stated as a broad
and impressive fact that, with the exception of a few
speculative authors, nearly all of whom have lived since the middle of the last century, the solid tra ditional belief of the whole human family in every age of the world has been that man began his exist ence pure and sinless, and in conscious and intelli gent divine communion. 1 This is the pan-ethnic no less than the Biblical doctrine of the Origin and
First Form of Religion among men.
It was remarked a moment ago that at the pres
ent time new light is greatly needed on this ques
tion. The need is special for the reason that for
about a hundred years past certain speculative minds, oblivious of the early history of mankind, ig noring the sacred books of all nations, despising the consentaneous convictions of all peoples, and more
or less ridiculing the very idea on which religion itself is based, namely, the idea of the existence and action of extra-human and super-human per sonalities, have undertaken to set aside the view which we have above described as the pan-ethnic
doctrine of the Origin of Religion, and to substitute
1 Compare Lenormant, Beginnings of History, ch. ii. The Duke of Argyll s Unity of Nature. London, 1884 : chapters xi., xii., and xiii.



364 PARADISE FOUND.
for it some other explanation,- so framed as to make
it appear that religion originated from man himself, apart from any divine manifestation, or teaching, or
impulse whatsoever. The result has been a succes
sion of crude speculations, inadequate in their prem ises and contradictory in their respective conclu sions. Professing unusual philosophic candor, aided by the interest which always attends novel attempts to set aside the beliefs of ages ; adapting themselves
to every class of readers, and especially to all the suc
cessively ruling fashions in non-religious and irrelig ious current speculation, these writers have at last
not only wrought a perfect confusion in this portion of the Philosophy of Religion, but have furthermore so degraded and bestialized their readers concep
tion of primitive humanity, and so outraged all prob ability in their descriptions of primitive savagery,
that even from biological and sociological sides a strong reaction has already set in. It will be instructive briefly to review the history of these speculations, and to note the successive
stages of ever-deepening error and the mutual con tradiction of their much-admired results. The first of them of any note was David Hume,
the English deist and champion of philosophic doubt.
In his &quot; Natural History of Religion
&quot;
(published in 1755), he lays down this as his first and fundamen
tal proposition :
&quot; Polytheism was the primary re
ligion of mankind.&quot;
His first argument in support of this thesis is an
appeal to the evidence of post-christian history. He
puts it thus :
&quot; It is a matter of fact, incontestable, that about
1700 years ago all mankind were polytheists. The



EARLIEST FORM OF RELIGION. 365
doubtful and skeptical principles of a few philoso phers, or the theism and that not entirely too pure of one or two nations, form no objection worth re
garding. Behold, then, the clear testimony of history.
The farther we mount into antiquity the more do we
find mankind plunged into polytheism. No marks, no
symptoms, of any more perfect religion. The most
ancient records of the human race still present us with that system as the popular and established
creed. The North, the South, the East, the West, give their unanimous testimony to the same fact.
What can be opposed to so full an evidence ?
&quot;
The force of this passage consists almost ex
clusively in its cool positiveness of dogmatic asser tion. Plainly, the condition of the majority of man
kind 1700 years ago affords no just criterion by which to judge of the condition of the race thou sands of years before that. Indeed, to any believer in historic evolution of any sort, it would seem an
tecedently certain that the condition of men several thousand years after the commencement of their ex istence must be very different indeed from their
primitive condition. But, furthermore, he grants
that 1700 years ago the prevalence of polytheism was, after all, not universal ; there were &quot; one or two nations &quot; of theists, and even philosophers in other nations, who doubted the truth of polytheism. It was absurd, therefore, to talk of &quot; the unanimous
testimony
&quot; of North and South, East and West.
The second point urged by Hume is the improb ability of the supposition that &quot; a barbarous, ne cessitous animal, such as man is, on the first origin
of society,&quot; a being &quot; pressed by such numerous wants and passions,&quot; should have had either the



366 PARADISE FOUND.
disposition, or the capacity, or the leisure, so to study &quot;the order and frame of the universe &quot; as im
mediately to be led &quot; into the pure principles of
theism.&quot; He grants that a careful and philosophic
consideration of the unity and order of the natu ral world is sufficient to conduct one to an assured
belief in the being of one Supreme and Almighty
Creator, but he says,
&quot; I can never think that this consideration could have an influence on mankind when they formed their first rude notions of re
ligion.&quot; Assuming that the first men must nec
essarily have been &quot; an ignorant multitude,&quot; he
says, &quot; It seems certain that, according to the natural
progress of human thought, the ignorant multitude must first entertain some groveling and familiar notion of superior powers before they stretch their
conception to that perfect Being who bestowed order on the whole frame of nature/
The force of this argument it is difficult to see.
It all rests upon two assumptions: first, the assump
tion that the first men were the lowest barbarians, to use his own words, &quot; barbarous, necessitous an imals ;
&quot;
and, secondly, the assumption that there was, apart from the philosophic study of nature, no other way in which they could have obtained a belief
in the existence of the Creator. As no religionist of any age has ever admitted these assumptions, and
as Hume adduces no particle of proof for either of
them, this part of his argument is surely quite un worthy of a professed philosopher. His next and last point is the impossibility of the loss of the monotheistic faith if it had once been reached by the earliest men. He says,



EARLIEST FORM OF RELIGION. 367
&quot;If men were at first led into the belief of one
superior Being by reason-ing from the frame of na ture, they could never possibly leave [have left] that belief in order to embrace polytheism ; but the same
principles of reason which at first produced and dif fused over mankind so magnificent an opinion must
be [have been] able, with greater facility, to pre serve it. The first invention and proof of any doc
trine is much more difficult than the supporting and
retaining of it.&quot;
Here our author appears to even poorer advan tage than in either of his former arguments. In
the first place, as before, he ignores the possibility
of supposing a knowledge of God by means of a di vine self-manifestation, thus covertly misrepresent ing or evading the only point in debate. In the sec ond place, the assertion that if the first men had attained to a pure theism they never could have left it and become polytheists should be compared with his own later assertions in Section viii. of the same treatise, where he describes what he himself calls
the &quot;Flux and Reflux of Polytheism and Theism.&quot; This section opens thus :
&quot; It is remarkable that the principles of religion have a kind of flux and reflux in the human mind, and that men have a natural tendency to rise from
idolatry to theism, and to sink again from theism
into idolatry.&quot;
The author then states his well-known theory of
the origin of polytheism as the first form of religion, and his theory of the rise of monotheism out of polytheism. But when a people have thus reached a belief in a God possessed of &quot;the attributes of
unity and affinity, simplicity and spirituality,&quot; there



368 PARADISE FOUND.
comes so he declares a natural relapse into
polytheism. The explanation of this is given in these words : &quot; Such refined ideas [as those of pure monothe
ism], being somewhat disproportioned to vulgar com prehension, remain not long in their original purity, but require to be supported by the notion of inferior mediators or subordinate agents, which interpose between mankind and their supreme deity. These
demi-gods, or middle beings, partaking more of hu man nature, and being more familiar to us, become the chief objects of devotion. . . . But as these
idolatrous religions fall every day into grosser and more vulgar corruptions, they at last destroy them selves, and by the vile representations which they
form of their duties make the tide turn again toward
them.&quot;
Thus monotheism and polytheism are, to Hume,
two opposites, between which the human mind for
ever oscillates. This being so, it is plain that this
oscillation is grounded in reason, or it is not. If it
is grounded in reason, then primitive men may have
reasoned their way into monotheism as their first
religious faith, and still have relapsed into polythe
ism as the natural and rational reaction. On the other hand, if the oscillation is not grounded in rea
son, then, as by his own account all later religious states of mankind have been unreasonable, the first
may have been altogether different from what Hume
would have considered rational ; that is, may have been a state of pure monotheism.
Such was Hume s attempted demonstration of
the primitiveness of polytheism, and the whole
of it.



EARLIEST FORM OF RELIGION. 369
Five years later, in 1760, De Brosses, one of Vol
taire s correspondents, published his crude but note worthy book on &quot; The Worship of Fetiches ; or, Parallel of the Ancient Religion of Egypt with the
Present Religion of Nigritia.&quot; This was the writer
who first gave currency to the word &quot;
fetichism,&quot;
and who first postulated it as the invariable ante
cedent of polytheism. De Brosses, however, was a professed believer in primeval divine revelation, and he made the Hebrews an exception to his general claim that all ancient nations began with fetichism, rose thence to polytheism, and tended thence to ward monotheism. In the early part of the present
century, however, Auguste Comte, ignoring any pri
meval revelation, elevated De Brosses generaliza tion into an absolute law of historic development.
He gave the greater plausibility and influence to it by representing this law of theological progress as only part of a yet broader social law, according to which humanity, having traversed this &quot;
theological stage
&quot; in the manner indicated, passes next through
a &quot;metaphysical&quot; one, and finally attains the &quot;sci entific &quot;
stage of atheistic positivism.
In Germany, in 1795, Hume s opinion found an able representative in G. L. Bauer, of Altdorf, and ten years later we see Meiners, in his &quot; Universal
History of Religion,&quot; repeating and enforcing the notion of the absolute primitiveness of fetichism.
The rationalistic and pantheistic tendencies of Ger
man speculation about this time were, of course, favorable to any new theory which discredited the Biblical one, and thus it came to pass that before the middle of the present century the De Brosses
theory, in its completer Comtean form, became al24

most universally adopted. Speaking of its preva
lence, Professor Max Miiller says:
&quot; All of us have been brought up on it. I myself certainly held it for a long time, and never doubted it till I became more and more startled by the fact that, while in the earliest accessible documents of
religious thought we look in vain for any very clear traces of fetichism, they become more and more fre
quent everywhere in the latter stages of religious
development, and are certainly more visible in the
later corruptions of the Indian religion, beginning with the Atharvana, than in the earliest hymns of
the Rig Veda.&quot; 1
For many years our works on primeval history
have been saturated with this idea. Even profess
edly Christian writers upon the History of Religions, and upon Comparative Theology, have largely fallen
in with the prevailing notion. As one has well said, &quot;The very theory has become a kind of scientific
fetich, though like most fetiches it seems to owe its
existence to ignorance and superstition.&quot; For some time past, however? this long dominant dogma of naturalism has been losing credit with all careful students of the world s religions, and indeed
with the more thorough professional ethnologists. In his recent work, &quot;The Hibbert Lectures on the
Origin and Growth of Religion,&quot;
2 Max Miiller, him self for a long time, as we have seen, a believer in
the theory, publicly challenges its correctness. In Lecture second, after rapidly sketching the rise and remarkable prevalence of the theory, he exposes,

with much acuteness and with his usual wealth of illustrative facts, the indiscriminateness with which the term fetichism has been currently used, and the worthlessness of evidence upon which Comte and
others have relied. He sets forth, respectfully but
strongly, the inadequacy of their psychological ex planation of the origin of fetichism, and shows that even the West African fetich-worshipers hold at the
same time other views properly polytheistic, or, in
some cases, even monotheistic. Summing up his
own conclusions, he says,
&quot; The results at which we have arrived after ex amining the numerous works on fetichism from the
days of De Brosses to our own time may be summed
up under four heads :
&quot; First. The meaning of the word fetich has re mained undefined from its first introduction, and has by most writers been so much extended that it may include almost every symbolical or imitative
representation of religious objects. &quot; Second. Among people who have a history we find that everything which falls under the category
of fetich points to historical and psychological ante
cedents. We are therefore not justified in suppos ing that it has been otherwise among people whose
religious development happens to be unknown or inaccessible to us. &quot; Third. There is no religion which has kept itself entirely free from fetichism. &quot; Fourth. There is no religion which consists
entirely of fetichism.&quot; l

fetichistic philosophy of the origin of religion, com

ing from the pen of a scholar so widely and deserv
edly revered, cannot fail to produce in the world of general readers and second-hand writers a profound and wholesome impression. Probably the work will
fail of becoming &quot; epoch-making
&quot;
solely in conse quence of something for which the author is not re
sponsible, namely, the fact that in discussing to-day this dogma of primitive fetichism one is really deal ing with an issue which in advanced circles is al
ready dead. Even Mr. Andrew Lang, perhaps the most antagonistic of all Professor Miiller s review ers, is not himself willing to make fetichism the
&quot; first moment in the development of religion.&quot;
1
Ten or fifteen years earlier the polemic would have done many times the good it can now. During this
period a decided change has taken place. There re mained a decade or two ago a further step, and but one further step, for the advocates of the naturalistic
view of the origin of religion to take. Hume had
made polytheism the primitive faith ; Comte thought
to go back of this, and to postulate a still more ru
dimentary form as antedating polytheism. It re mained to go back of fetichism, and predicate of the
first men absolute atheism. This various recent au thors have done, prominent among whom, in Eng land, is Sir John Lubbock. In chapter iv. of his
work, miscalled &quot; The Origin of Civilization, and the Primitive Condition of Man,&quot;
2 he classifies &quot; the first
great stages of religious thought
&quot; as follows : First. Atheism ;
&quot; understanding by this term not

ligions. Paris, 1883: p. 117.



EARLIEST FORM OF RELIGION. 373
a denial of the existence of a deity, but an absence
of any definite ideas on the subject.&quot; Second. Fetichism. In the state of primeval athe ism men were &quot; not without a belief in invisible be
ings.&quot; They especially believed in human shadows, ghosts, and the people seen in dreams, etc., though these spirits were not conceived of as immortal, or
as possessing any supernatural powers. They were feared only because they were supposed to have
power and disposition to inflict disease, or otherwise to injure men yet in the flesh. Now, inasmuch as it was believed that by means of the fetich these evil spirits could be controlled and coerced to the will of
the worshiper, fetichism, viewed in its relation to
religious development, is pronounced by Lubbock
&quot; a decided step in advance.&quot; Viewed in itself,
&quot; it
is mere witchcraft.&quot;
Third. Totemism, or Nature-worship. This our author nowhere clearly distinguishes from fetich
ism. In this stage of religious progress, &quot; the sav age does not abandon his belief in fetichism, from
which, indeed, no race of men has yet entirely freed itself, but he superinduces on it a belief in beings of ~a higher and less material nature. In this stage
everything maybe worshiped, trees, stones, riv ers, mountains, the heavenly bodies, plants, and
animals.&quot;
Fourth. Shamanism. &quot; As totemism overlies
fetichism, so does Shamanism overlie totemism.&quot; Here the gods are conceived of as far more &quot; power
ful than men,&quot; as &quot; of a different nature,&quot; as residing
far away, and as &quot; accessible only to the Shamans,&quot;
who are &quot;
occasionally honored by the presence of the deities, or are allowed to visit the heavenly



374 PARADISE FOUND.
regions.&quot; This in its turn is pronounced &quot;a consid erable advance &quot; over the preceding stage of relig
ious thought. Fifth. Idolatry, or Anthropomorphism. Here
&quot;the gods take still more completely the nature of
men, being, however, more powerful. They are still amenable to persuasion ; they are a part of Nature, and not creators. They are represented by images
or idols.&quot;
Sixth. To the sixth stage no name is given ; but it is described as one in which &quot; the deity is re
garded as the author, not merely a part, of Nature.
He becomes for the first time a really supernatural
being.&quot;
Seventh. In this last and highest stage, which he
also leaves unchristened, morality becomes &quot; for the
first time associated with religion.&quot;
*
We will not stop to criticise in detail this ex tremely confused and ill-named classification, or the assumptions on which it rests. Its most character
istic feature is its postulation of universal primitive
atheism as antedating every form of religious devel opment in our race. So far as he rested this dogma either upon the affirmed absence of all religious be
liefs and usages among the lowest savages of to-day, or upon the principle that the religious conceptions of a people are always in exact proportion to its degree of civilization, his refutation quickly began. The next year after the publication of his work, in a learned treatise on &quot; Primitive Culture,&quot; E. B. Tylor challenged several of Lubbock s authorities for the statement that non-religious tribes have been found,
while in his new work on &quot; The Human Species,&quot;
1 Chaps, iv.-vi.



EARLIEST FORM OF RELIGION. 3/5
1879, the learned and able Professor of Anthro
pology in the Paris Museum of Natural History,
Quatrefages, went yet further, not only maintaining
with Tylor that no atheistic tribe of savages has yet
been discovered, but also expressly denying the proposition that elevation of religious conceptions
invariably corresponds to the elevation of a peo
ple in the scale of general civilization or knowl
edge of the arts. The fact that these objections to
the hypothesis of primitive atheism came, not from
theologians, but from scientific men, from fellow
students in the fields of anthropology and ethnology,
gave them, with many, all the greater weight. 1 The careful reader, however, cannot fail to see that the only difference between Lubbock and some of his
critics is merely one of name, and not of thing ; that the alleged primitive state which he calls atheistic exactly answers to what Tylor and Darwin would describe as the earliest form of animistic religion, and to what Herbert Spencer would call the first
rudimentary beginnings of ghost and ancestor wor
ship. Nor can we fail to see that the consistent Darwinian evolutionist must place the beginnings of
human history so near the plane of the brute-life as to make it almost certain that its first stage was
truly non-theistic, if not, indeed, altogether non-re
ligious. Precisely at this point notice should be taken of the elaborate work of Otto Caspari, of Heidelberg,
entitled &quot; Die Urgeschichte der Menschheit, mit
1 Professor Roskoff has done Mr. Lubbock the honor to take up every tribe and people, in the extended list which the latter had claimed as non-religious, and to exhibit in every case evidence of their religious character. See his work, Das Religionswesen der rohesten Naturvolker. Leipsic, 1880.

Riicksicht auf die natiirliche Entwickelung des friihesten Geisteslebens &quot;
(&quot; The Primitive History of Man kind, with Respect to the Natural Evolution of the Earliest Spiritual Life).&quot; This two-volumed treatise was issued at Leipsic in 1872, and reached a second
edition in 1877. A very large portion of it is de voted to the exposition of the author s view of the origin and natural evolution of religion in the early history of the race. This view is characterized
by an originality and elaborated with an ingenuity which render the book as fascinating to the student as the most absorbing romance. The author is a
pure and professed evolutionist, but instead of at tempting to solve his problem with Lyell and Broca from the data of Paleontology, or with Darwin and Hackel from the data of Zoology, or with Huxley and Bastian from the data of Biology, or with Miiller and Noire from the data of Philology, or with Prichard and Peschel from the data of Ethnology, or with Tylor and Lubbock from the data of Cul
ture-History, or with Waitz and Topinard from the data of General Anthropology, he approaches it and grapples with it as a problem for that higher and broader science to which all of the above are tribu tary, the science to which its German originators
have given the name Volker-Psydialogic (Ethnic or
Anthropic Psychology). He cannot consider the problem solved until, beginning with the psycholog ical facts of brute-life, we are able to represent to ourselves the successive steps and stages by which the originally animal mind slowly evolved all the
spiritual and religious conceptions, emotions, habits, and ideals of the historic and actual human race.
His own attempt to do this is not free from arbitrary



EARLIEST FORM OF RELIGION. 377
assumptions or inconsistencies, but, as a whole, it is a marvel of subtile analysis and constructive ability.
In contrast with it the expositions of Hume and
Lubbock appear as clumsy and grotesque as the early theories of geology, described in Goldsmith s &quot; Book of Nature,&quot; now look to the modern student One of the oldest of the anti-supernaturalist ex
planations of the origin of religion is that which ascribes it to the ignorant and superstitious fears oi earliest men. &quot; Primus in orbe deos fecit timer,&quot;
wrote Petronius, and Lucretius fuller exposition of
the same notion is familiar. No such explanation
satisfies Caspari. He cannot conceive how fear could ever become that compound of reverence and love which is of the essence of religion. Fear simply prompts the brute to shun, as far as may be, the
object feared. Equally unsatisfactory is the notion that the heavenly bodies and the sublimer phenom ena of nature inspired the awe and curious ques
tionings out of which religion could have grown. The primitive man, like the anthropoid brute, took no notice of the remote and lofty. Nothing had in terest for him save that which was perceived to be
vitally related to him in the struggle for existence.
The range of his conceptions and of his sympathies was limited to the objects which were his allies or
his enemies in this perpetual battle. Religion, there fore, is not to be traced to any inworking of nature,
or of natural objects upon the human mind. It had
a deeper and yet more obvious genesis in natural hu
man relationships. The first and root form of all piety
was filial piety. The first object of truly religious regard was the parent. This reverential and affec



3/8 PARADISE FOUND.
tionate regard of the consciously ignorant, weak, and dependent child for the indefinitely wise, strong,
and helpful father or mother is essentially religious. At an extremely early date it must have become ex
tended from the parent to the all-defending and all
regulating tribal chieftain, and to the aged and ex
perienced counselors of the rude primeval commu nities. The natural tendency of uncivilized men to
gesture-language must have produced habitual forms of rendering homage, the germ of which we may observe in the homage paid by the bees to their
queen, and thus parents, chieftains, and sages were the first objects of religious reverence and homage
among men. As yet men had no conceptions of
nature as a whole, no intellectual interest in stars, or
trees, or animals, no mental provocation to worship anything else than &quot;the ethically exalted&quot; as it ap
peared in the narrow circle of the family and tribal life. There was no thought of an unseen world, no
idea of souls, no proper conception even of death.
The dead man was supposed to be simply asleep, or
in a long swoon. Being self-evidently helpless for the present, like a sick member of the family, he called out natural pity and care. Food and drink
were placed in readiness against his awakening. If he had to be left behind, he was put in a cave to
protect him against wild beasts, and his weapons were left for his use.
On the basis of this nai ve conception of things the rise of animal worship first becomes conceivable. The beast which has devoured a man, living or dead, is now as much man as beast. The man has not ceased to be ; he has simply blended his life in that
of the beast, and become a &quot; man-beast.&quot; The feroc



EARLIEST FORM OF RELIGION. 3/9
ity of the new compound is easily mistaken for an
angry wish on the part of the late man to take ven geance on his relatives or associates for not having
more effectually protected him from the devouring animal. But if the &quot; man-beast &quot;
is human enough to remember and avenge such real or supposed neg lects on the part of his late friends, he must be hu
man enough to recognize and appreciate any wellmeant attempts to appease his anger and propitiate his favor. Hence a natural basis, not for universal animal worship, but for the worship of the more common carnivora, and these Caspari endeavors to show were the first that attained such distinction. Here, also, is found the origin of cannibalism.
A man has killed his foe. If he leaves him merely dead he will some time come to life again as bad as ever. If haply before this some wild beast devour him, he will then become a ferocious and malevo
lent &quot;
man-beast,&quot; a worse enemy than before. There is no way of making the victory final and se
cure, except by eating him up one s self. Then the life and valor of the slain become life and valor to the slayer. Even the eating of others than foes
is in this way made intelligible. As the Fan Ne groes are said to eat &quot; with a certain tenderness &quot; the bodies of their wives and children, so the
primitive man, seeking the safest possible place for the body of his dead friend, may have thought it a
far friendlier act to eat him up than to leave him to take his chances at the hand of worms underground,
or beasts of prey above it. Between the two mo
tives, the desire to appropriate the vital forces of the foe and the wish to do the best possible thing for the unwakable friend, our author thinks that

anthropophagy became in the first age of the world
almost universal. The very piety of the surviving toward the dead contributed to the dissemination of the revolting custom. Our limits will not permit an equally full account
of the remaining stages by which religion grew to be
what it has been and is in the world. Suffice to say that possible millenniums from the beginning of
human history
&quot; toward the end of the Stone Age,&quot; there occurred the greatest revolution in human thought and belief and life which the race has yet witnessed. This was brought about by the rise and
adoption of the belief that trees and men and beasts
in fine, all natural objects are possessed of
invisible, impalpable, vital principles, souls. That
which produced and supported this strange, new no tion was a discovery which, estimated by the breadth
and profoundness of its influence, must be placed at the head of all others, the discovery, namely, of
the art of kindling fire. This mysterious and novel
power of evoking what seemed a bright and living being from the realm of the invisible, by means of
the &quot;fire-drill,&quot; half bewildered even the priestly
caste, in whose hands the awful secret lay. Their attempts to use it led to Shamanism and a sincere magic. By means of the observed vital heat of
living things and the coldness of the dead the new element was quickly identified with the inner es
sence of life itself, and the new art the more com mended to universal attention by means of its be neficent applications in the hands of the Flamens,
or Fire-priests, to the purposes of healing. The same identification of heat and life soon associated
phallus and fire-drill, and introduced the strange and



EARLIEST FORM OF RELIGION. 381
apparently monstrous aberration of phallic worship. Under these new ideas it was only natural that sun and star and lightning flash should come to have a new significance for man, and make their impress on religion. Animal worship was profoundly mod ified in ways ingeniously set forth. The simple oblations of the earlier period give place to sacri
fices to fire, and to the heavenly bodies. So strong is the desire to become transformed into white,
flaming spirits, and to be joined to the supernal fellowship of such, that men bring themselves as
offerings, and seek transfiguration in the holy altar
flames. Hence human sacrifices ; hence also in cremation of the dead. In time, the idea of the
soul takes on greater and greater definiteness ; so also the idea of the immaterial supersensual gods.
The long-continued stimulation of the imagination renders myth-constructions possible. Some of the great priesthoods of history invent hieroglyphic and alphabetic writing, and in time there naturally fol
low sacred books, cosmogonies, codes of religious
laws, etc., etc. The magic wand of the first firebringer has at last created a spiritual and unseen counterpart to the world which is seen. In this enchanted world we live to-day ; the lowest of us
showing our faith by superstitious fetichism, the highest of us by attempts at a purely spiritual wor
ship. That highest Christian conception, &quot; God is
light, and in Him is no darkness at all,&quot; is simply
the culmination of a mode of thinking which started ages ago with the spark which some savage prehis toric flint-chipper struck out of the flinty stone. 1
1 Very similar to Caspari s view is that set forth by Professor J.
Frohschammer in his late work, Die Genesis der Menschheit. Miinchen, 1883: pp. 68-38 1.



382 PARADISE FOUND.
The brevity of this sketch of Caspari s theory ren
ders it impossible to do full justice to the skill and plausibility with which he has elaborated it. Still less have we space for that detailed review which would be needed were we to undertake a refutation of the scheme in part or whole.
In striking opposition to the theory of Caspari stands that of Jules Baissac, elaborated in his &quot; Ori
gines de la Religion.&quot;
1 He, too, begins with primi tive animality, and proposes to trace the rise and natural evolution of religion from that far-off start
ing-point of the human race. But, instead of mag nifying the initial influence of a pure domestic life
in Caspari s truly German method, Baissac in a
manner characteristically French, shall we say ? starts with a deification of mere maternity, con
ceived of as self-originating and self-sufficing. This
form of religion prevailed during the remote period anterior to the time when it was discovered that
males had any participation in the procreation of the species. The religious symbols of that far-off age were &quot; les elevations et tumescences terrestres, natu
relles ou artificielles, et les cavites souterraines ; les tumescences comme image du sein maternel en etat
de pregnation et les profondeurs et cavites comme ventre sacr de la divine mere. De la le culte des
ballons ou montagnes a croupe arrondie ; de la le
symbolisme des tumuli, des pyramides, des grottes,
des puits, des labyrinthes, des dolmens.&quot; In this
period all motherhood is divine, and all life and
change in nature are mentally represented as a spontaneous, and exclusively female, conceiving and bringing forth.

New York, 1870: Part I., pp. 411-414.



EARLIEST FORM OF RELIGION. 383
In the second period, which is still anterior to the idea of marriage and to the establishment of the
idea of personal property or individual rights, the function of the male principle has been discovered ; and now Nature, the divine mother, is conceived of as analogous to a woman of the period, a mother
fecundated only by male energy, but by male energy
from any quarter. To use Baissac s own terms, she
is a &quot;
prostituee divine, ayant son symbole dans la terre ouverte a tous les germes.&quot;
1
In the third period the two principles are brought
into a relation of equality, and now the divine be
comes hermaphrodite. In the fourth the male principle is given priority, the religious symbols of maternity give place to the phallic symbols, the institutions of marriage and property arise, the power of atmospheric and celes tial divinities begins to supersede that of earth
spirits. The fifth stage is marked by the entire predominance of these celestial divinities and the definite rejection of the ancient chthonian and sub terranean powers. In the sixth comes the final separation of the Heaven and the Earth, the idea of creation, and the idea of an almighty and transcend ent Creator of all things. The manner in which the author elaborates this
remarkable interpretation of the history and symbol ism of religion, through two octavo volumes of 300
pages each, is as ingenious as it is disgusting. Behold the savory outcome of these successive
philosophic and scientific rebellions against history !
And whom of all these wise men of the West shall
we follow ? The first form of religion, says one of

them, was an animal hallucination of the early an
thropoids respecting sexual generation. No, says another, it was a genuine worship of invisible gods and goddesses, like the beautiful Olympian divini
ties of Greece, a religion whose fruits in character and conduct compare most favorably with those of Christian monotheism. 1 Absurd ! exclaims a third.
&quot; Polytheism
&quot;
is a very high type of religion ; men never could have reached that until after the inven
tion of the fire-drill, nobody knows how many ages
from the beginning. Fools all! rejoin the more
thorough-going. Know ye not that primitive men were far lower than our lowest modern savages, as
incapable of any religious ideas as they were of us ing the integral calculus ?
At the beginning of the exposition of these specu lations it was intimated that their contradictory and
incredible outcome had already provoked a degree
of reaction even from biological and sociological writers. This reaction is too instructive to leave unnoticed.2 It comes from men who, religiously or
theologically speaking, seem in full sympathy with the rejecters of the old Biblical and pan-ethnic faith ; but they find they cannot go along with these re
jecters without surrendering more than any biol ogist or sociologist can afford to surrender if he would maintain a credible philosophy of the history
of man and of human society. To a simple disciple of history the spectacle of their embarrassment and of their attempts at extrication is in an eminent
degree entertaining. Indeed, the best refutation of whatever is wrong in all these new conceptions of

primordial religion will be found, not in a blind and indiscriminate polemic against them en masse, but in showing how every departure from the traditional conception involves the careful thinker in perplex
ing if not insoluble problems, and how easily all the real facts on which these proposed departures are based can be arrayed in support of the traditional
conception. To this task we turn.
First, then, according to Genesis, the earliest rep resentatives of the human race began their exist
ence in Paradise unclad, unhoused, and possessed of none of the outward and visible signs of what is called civilization. Had Mr. Lubbock been per mitted at the time to visit the spot, he would have
seen so far as Moses suggests no printing-press,
no power-loom, perhaps not even a &quot;fire-drill&quot; or
flint &quot; arrow-head.&quot; He would have seen no god,
no Miltonic guard of angels, no Eden gates, no tem
ple or altar. He would have noticed in the luxu
riant tropical landscape simply a wealth of grace ful animal forms, rising in manifold gradations, and
culminating in two fair human figures. He would doubtless have gone his way, and reported at the
next meeting of the Anthropological Society the discovery of a new Otaheite, whose naked and art less inhabitants were evidently at the bottom of the
scale as respects &quot;
culture,&quot; and in the sub-fetichis
tic &quot; atheistic stage
&quot; as respects religion. So do ing, he would have committed no greater blunder than many of his favorite reporters have made in
describing such people as the Andaman Islanders.1

Sumner Maine, Early Law and Custom, London, 1883, pp. 229-231 ;

According to the old conception, no less than ac
cording to the new, the arts were only gradually
developed. Men were destitute of the art of metalworking and of all to which that was essential until the days of Tubal Cain. Musical instruments there were none until invented by Jubal. Everything in sacred Scripture indicates the kind of social and industrial progress for which, in connection with the beginnings of human society, one would natu
rally look. So far, then, the believer in Sacred History has no occasion whatever to disagree with the believer in Natural History. Hackel and Peschel and Caspari
hold, with Moses, to the monogenesis of the race,
and even place their imaginary &quot;Lemuria&quot; just
under the northern portion of the Indian Ocean, hard by one of the traditional seats of Eden. Their
account of man s migrations from that centre, and of his primeval destitution of the arts, conflict with
no fact recorded in Holy Scripture. Neither party
can tell precisely how long the period antecedent to the rise of the first great historic civilizations of
Asia, Egypt, and Greece lasted, and neither can tell
how long ago it terminated, so that even in their confessed ignorances both are in accord.
But, secondly, the believer in Sacred History, He brew or Ethnic, cannot accept the eagerly advocated notion that the intellectual condition of the earliest men was not higher than that of the lowest savages
of to-day. Ignorant of many things those earliest generations must have been, but it is equally certain

that they must have been above the line which sep
arates stationary or retrograding peoples from pro gressive ones. They were men capable of investigat ing the powers and laws of nature, of originating arts absolutely new in the history of the world, and of making successive inventions which revolution
ized the social state.
With this representation we should expect the Darwinian, on sober second thought, to agree. For it is a well-known fact that our lowest savages are dying out, while the men who peopled the world in accordance with the law of the survival of the fittest,
at a period in the earth s history when, in important respects, according to Darwin, the environment was less favorable to the human struggle for existence than now, must have been superior to these de
generating and vanishing tribes. And as all evo
lutionists, in enumerating the qualities which win
in the struggle for existence, lay great stress upon superior intellectual endowments, it is only a nat ural inference that the native intelligence of the
earliest men was at least superior to that of the low est modern savage. Turning to the writers in ques
tion we find our antecedent expectations confirmed. Thus Mr. Herbert Spencer, in one of his maturest works, expresses himself as follows :
&quot; There
are sundry reasons for suspecting that existing men of the lowest types, forming social groups of the
simplest kinds, do not exemplify men as they origi nally were. Probably most of them, if not all of them, had ancestors in higher states, and among their beliefs remain some which were evolved dur
ing those higher states. . . . There is inadequate warrant for the notion that the lowest savagery has



388 PARADISE FOUND.
always been as low as it is now. . . . That supplant ing of race by race, and thrusting into corners such inferior races as are not exterminated, which is now going on so actively, and which has been going on from the earliest recorded times, must have been ever going on. And the implication is that remnants
of inferior races, taking refuge in inclement, barren,
and otherwise unfit regions, have retrograded.&quot;
l
In like manner Darwin himself conceives of the
first men as capable of rising in thought above the
knowledge furnished by the senses, as able to repre
sent to themselves the unseen and spiritual. And he
expressly calls their mental faculties &quot;
high,&quot; say
ing,
&quot; The same high mental faculties which first
led men to believe in unseen spiritual agencies, then
in fetichism, polytheism, and ultimately in monothe ism, would infallibly lead him, so long as his reason ing powers remained poorly developed, to various
strange superstitions and customs.&quot; 2 Thus Darwin justly considers the character of the very aberra tions of the human intellect in its infantile stage a
striking proof of the loftiness of its powers. Lubbock ascribes to the earliest men a like ability to conceive of the supersensual and to govern them selves largely by ideals. Though sometimes de
scribing the primitive generations as in a state of &quot;utter barbarism,&quot; or as having been &quot; no more ad vanced than the lowest savages of to-day,&quot; this seems to occur only by inadvertence ; for in the later
editions of his already quoted work, &quot; The Origin
of Civilization,&quot; page 483, he expressly admits and asserts that he does not regard cannibals as repre

sentatives of the first men. 1 On the same page he
says,
&quot; It may be as well to state emphatically that
all brutal customs are not, in my opinion, primeval.
Human sacrifices, for instance, were, I think, cer
tainly not so.&quot;
Caspari no less emphatically affirms that the so cial state of the North American Indians and of the Australians is not primitive, but a result of degen
eration. He says,
&quot; We know a succession of such
tribes, of which, in fact, only ausgeartete verkommene Banden und staatliche Splitter remain in existence, who, wild and savage, wander about in the primitive
forests, miserably to perish.&quot;
2
Tylor takes the same general ground, maintaining
that the best representatives of primitive men are not the lowest but &quot;the higher&quot; of the uncivilized
races. Thus he says,
&quot; In a study of the nature
myths of the world it is hardly practicable to start
from the conceptions of the very lowest human tribes, and to work upward from thence to fictions of higher growth : partly because our information is meagre as to the beliefs of these shy and seldom
quite intelligible folk, and partly because the legends they possess have not reached the artistic and sys tematic shape which they attain to among races next higher in the scale. It therefore answers better
1 Let us hope that it is by a like inadvertence, merely, that Profes
sor Sayce speaks of &quot; the savage tribes of the modern world, and the
still more savage tribes among whom the languages of the earth took their start.&quot; Introdtiction to the Science of Language, vol. ii., p. 31.
Compare p. 269, where, speaking of the mythopoeic man, whom he considers a considerable advance on the primitive savage, the profes
sor says,
&quot; He had not yet learned to distinguish between the lifeless
and the living ;
&quot; &quot; he had not yet realized that aught existed which his senses could not perceive.&quot; 2 Vol.i.,p. 113.

to take as a foundation the mythology of the North American Indians, the South Sea Islanders, and other high savage tribes who best represent in mod
ern times the early mythological period of human
history&quot;
1
In chapter ii. of the same work he presents the evidence that many of the very lowest tribes of the modern world have become what they are by degen eration.
But, thirdly, if the best representatives of the first men must be sought, not among the lowest, but rather among the higher, of the uncivilized peoples,
then surely we are justified in rejecting the notion
of all those writers who, since the time of De Brosses and Comte, have maintained that primitive men personified and vitalized and fetichized all natu ral objects about them.
On this point the author of the &quot; Outlines of
Cosmic Philosophy&quot; is less clear-sighted than his master, Herbert Spencer. Boldly and ably as he
criticises Comte in some other particulars, in this Mr. Fiske surrenders to him wholly. He says, &quot;We
may safely assert, with Comte, that the earliest atti tude assumed by the mind in interpreting nature
was a fetichistic attitude.&quot; 2 Spencer, however, rec
ognizing the fact that the lower mammals, birds, and even insects are able to distinguish animate from inanimate objects, and that to deny this capacity to
the first men would be to make them less and lower than animals, commits himself unreservedly to the view in harmony with that of the Biblical record.
Quoting the stock examples of savages who, on

first seeing a watch or a compass, imagined that it was alive, he shows the naturalness of the mis
take, and very properly says :
&quot; We must exclude these mistakes made in classing things which ad vanced arts have made to simulate living things, since such things mislead the primitive man in ways unlike those in which he can be misled by the natu ral objects about him. Limiting ourselves to his conceptions of these natural objects, we cannot but conclude that his classification of them into animate
and inanimate is substantially correct. Concluding this, we are obliged to diverge at the outset from
certain interpretations currently given of his super stitions. The assumption, tacit or avowed, that the primitive man tends to ascribe life to things which
are not living is clearly an untenable assumption. Consciousness of the difference between the two,
growing ever more definite as intelligence evolves, must be in him more definite than in all lower crea tures. To suppose that without cause he begins to confound them is to suppose the process of evolu
tion inverted.&quot; 1
This writer, therefore, whom Darwin in one pas
sage calls &quot;our great philosopher,&quot; explicitly rejects
the dogma of the primitiveness and universality of animism and fetichism among the earliest men.
According to him, animistic and fetichistic beliefs
were not &quot; primary beliefs ;
&quot;
they were errors into
which &quot; the primitive man was betrayed during his
early attempts to understand the surrounding world.&quot;
&quot; The primitive man no more tends to confound animate with inanimate than inferior creatures do &quot;
(p. 146).

Caspar!, too, as we have seen, denies to fetichism
a primitive character. 1 Ascribing its rise to the
new ideas which the discovery of the art of fire-kin
dling produced, he makes the worship of u the mor ally exalted &quot;
(des sittlich Erhabenen}, represented by the personal father, the tribal chieftain, and the
deceased ancestor, far older, possibly thousands of
years older, than any worship of fetiches. With Lubbock there is no moral element in religion until
it reaches its last and highest stage. With Caspari,
on the contrary, religion is essentially moral in its first emergence, and has from the first moment of
its existence an actual and relatively worthy per
sonal object. This is a prodigious scientific advance from the&quot; positions of Hume, Comte, Lubbock, and all their followers, and by postulating a high moral nature and moral life at the very beginnings of hu man history it renders the Biblical conception of
those beginnings not only conceivable, but even an
tecedently probable. Fourthly. The Bible and the sacred traditions of
nearly all peoples present monogamy as the first
form of marriage, ascribing all deviations from it to
the ungoverned selfish passions of men. This view,
Lubbock and the writers whom he has followed,
McLennan and Morgan, emphatically reject. These
theorists claim that among the first men the late

EARLIEST FORM OF RELIGION. 393
Oneida Community system of &quot; complex marriage,&quot; or, as Lubbock calls it,
&quot; communal marriage,&quot; uni
versally obtained. The appropriateness of the term
marriage is very far from clear. The first communi
ties were mere herds, in which all the women were
&quot;wives&quot; to all the men. In McLennan s opinion &quot; the next stage was that form of polyandry in which
brothers had their wives in common ; afterward came that of the levirate, i. e., the system under which,
when an elder brother died, his second brother mar ried the widow, and so on with the others in suc cession. Thence he considered that some tribes branched off into endogamy, others into exogamy ; that is to say, some forbade marriage out of, others
within, the tribe. If either of these two systems was older than the other, he held that exogamy must have been the more ancient. Exogamy was based
on infanticide, and led to the practice of marriage by capture. Lubbock, on the contrary, believes that the communal marriage, which he assumes to
have been the primitive form, &quot; was gradually super seded by individual marriage founded on capture,&quot; and that this led, first, to exogamy, and then to
female infanticide, thus reversing Mr. McLennan s order of sequence. &quot; Endogamy and regulated poly
andry, though frequent,&quot; he says,
&quot; I regard as ex
ceptional and as not entering into the normal prog ress of development.&quot; 1 Still different is the theory of Bachofen, set forth in his work entitled &quot; Das
Mutterrecht.&quot; Assuming sexual promiscuity as the primordial state, he considers that under this system the women, instead of being rendered more and
1 Origin of Civilization, pp. 94, 95. Compare D. McLennan, The Patriarchal Theory. London, 1884 : P- 355



394 PARADISE FOUND.
more debauched and corrupted by the practice, as
we might suppose, became on the contrary, in pro cess of time, so refined, that after a season they felt shocked and scandalized by the beastly state of
things, revolted against it, and established a system of marriage with female supremacy, the husband be
ing subject to the wife, property and descent being
required to follow the female line, and women enjoy
ing the principal share of political power. Gradually, however, the more spiritual ideas asso
ciated with fatherhood prevailed over the more ma terial ideas associated with motherhood. The father came to be considered the real author of life to the offspring, the mother a mere nurse ; property and descent were traced in the male line, sun-worship
superseded moon-worship, men absorbed all political power, in a word, as primitive
&quot; Hetairismus&quot; was
followed by the &quot; Mother-Law &quot;
system, so this now
gave way to the modern social state.
The chief evolutionist authorities disagreeing so
widely on this point, it is surely proper to look fur
ther. So doing, we find a number of at least equally
respectable, scientific and speculative representa tives of the evolutional school, who expressly ques
tion, if they do not openly reject, the dogma of uni versal sexual promiscuity as the primeval social state.
Thus Herbert Spencer argues through many pages of his &quot; Principles of Sociology
&quot;
against McLennan, claiming that monogamy must be conceived of as
going back to the beginning. However unsettled social and sexual relations then were, &quot;
promiscuity,&quot;
he affirms, &quot;was checked by the establishment of in
dividual connections prompted by men s likings, and
maintained against other men by force&quot; (p. 665),



EARLIEST FORM OF RELIGION. 395
Again he says,
&quot; The impulses which lead primitive men to monopolize other objects of value must lead them to monopolize women &quot;
(p. 664). And again, &quot; Monogamy dates back as far as any other marital relation &quot;
(p. 698). Darwin takes substantially the same view, positively discrediting the alleged sexual promiscuity of the earliest communities. 1 In like manner another of the latest of English
writers on this subject, James A. Farrer, in his book entitled &quot; Primitive Manners and Customs,&quot; 2 em phatically rejects the notion that a brutal and forci
ble bride-capturing was ever universal, and denies that the customs relied upon by McLennan and others to prove its prevalence are to be viewed as a survival of such a custom. As to the absolutely
first form of marriage he does not express an opin
ion, but the theory of primitive monogamy would better agree with his general representation than any other. The same may be said of Caspari, who,
though he does not expressly postulate the priority of monogamy, yet ascribes to filial piety a role in
the first origination of religion which seems to ne cessitate such a postulate. 3 So Mr. John Fiske s suggestion that the transition from the anthropoid animals to truly human beings was probably effected
by the prolongation of infancy and of parental care incident to the slower evolution of a highly complex organism, and by the family life thus necessitated and brought about, is more harmonious with the doctrine of primitive monogamy than with any other.
It would not be surprising, therefore, if this class of

396 PARADISE FOUND.
considerations, which we meet again in Noire s the
ory of the origin of language, should gradually lead to such a reconstruction of Darwinistic sociology as
will postulate monogamy as the one and only form
of sexual relation by virtue of which man could have arisen out of the lower and preceding animal orders.
Mr. Spencer calls Mr. Fiske s suggestion &quot; an im
portant
&quot;
one, and he explains it in a note appended
to a significant declaration respecting the biological and sociological value of monogamy (p. 630). Else
where, after stating that &quot;
irregular relations of the sexes are at variance with the welfare of the society,
of the young and of the adults,&quot; and after ascribing
the gradual dying out of the Andamanese to their
promiscuity of sexual relation, 1 he says, &quot;We may infer that the progeny of such unions (as had a de gree of exclusiveness and durability) were more
likely to be reared and more likely to be vigorous
&quot;
(p. 669). Again, a page or two later, he uses this language :
&quot; As under ordinary conditions the rear ing of more numerous and stronger offspring must have been favored by more regular sexual relations, there must on the average have been a tendency for those societies most characterized by promiscuity to disappear before those less characterized by it
&quot;
(p.
671). But Spencer himself must grant that in the
earliest ages, upon the whole, the race multiplied and spread from generation to generation, so that we must at least conclude from his own declaration,
that the approximately monogamous societies and
1 Mr. E. H. Man s recent paper on the Andaman Islanders (The
Journal of the Anthropological Institute, vol. xii., i. 69, and ii. 13) de nies the alleged sexual promiscuity, and illustrates the worthlessness of much of the evidence on which popular ethnographers rely.



EARLIEST FORM OF RELIGION. 397
unions were more numerous than the approximately
promiscuous ones. Well, therefore, may Mr. Lang,
our latest advocate of McLennan s theory, concede
the possibility that &quot; man originally lived in the pa triarchal or monogamous family,&quot; and seek to con tent his fellow sociologists with the assurance that
&quot;
if there occurred a fall from the primitive family,
and if that fall was extremely general, affecting even the Aryan race, Mr. McLennan s adherents will be
amply satisfied.&quot; J
Fifthly. The Bible represents the earliest men as
capable of entertaining the conception of a supreme Divine Being, the Maker of the heavens and earth, the Creator and rightful Lord of men. It represents
them as capable of realizing the moral obligation of obedience to the Creator, and as possessed of free
dom to obey or to disobey. It gives us to understand
that, as a matter of fact, a few then as now were faithful to their light and to their convictions of
duty, while the greater part lived in conscious vio lation of the promptings of their own consciences.
As a natural consequence immoralities multiplied : these demoralized and brutalized those who practiced them. Then demoralized and brutalized parents were followed by children less well instructed and less well endowed than they themselves had been,
and so, despite exceptional men and exceptional fam ilies who were more faithful to conscience, the gen eral demoralization went on. The song of Lamech,
Gen. iv. 23, 24, is the song of a true savage, though
of one who has known the law of right and duty.

its polygamous author. He glories in his homicides, and evidently belongs to those who with savage lust
and brutality
&quot; took them wives of all which they
chose.&quot; He was a representative of his Cainite kin dred. By the mass of these and those who inter married with them the Father and Lord of all crea
tures was ignored and gradually misconceived, and at last superseded by creations of man s own disor
dered mind and heart, until the pure primitive relig ion of the righteous patriarchs became a false wor ship as irrational and immoral as the mass of those who gave themselves to its loathsome and cruel
practices. With some populations this abnormal and immoral evolution proceeded to thoroughly un natural and self-destructive results, such as religious
prostitution, sodomy, human sacrifices, cannibalism,
etc. On the other hand, then as now, fidelity to
truth and goodness led its possessor to larger knowl edge and to higher spiritual experiences. Then as ever the principle held good, &quot;To him that hath shall be given.&quot; Hence alongside and within and above the historic evolution of a large portion of the race from evil to evil there was another evolution of
a smaller but more vital portion from good to good.
If Satan s kingdom steadily unfolded, so did also the
kingdom of God. And while the one was in the
direction of spiritual and physical degeneration and death, the other was in the direction of life and ulti
mate spiritual ascendency. Both of these partial or special evolutions were within and part of the uni versal evolution of the race under its preestablished nature and conditions, one of which fundamental conditions is its immanency in the Divine. Such is
the picture presented us by all the monotheistic re



EARLIEST FORM OF RELIGION. 399
ligions of the world, and it is substantially confirmed by most of the ancient traditions of the human race.
Now in all this there is nothing inconsistent with any well-established facts or principles of science.
Some authorities which Lubbock himself quotes prove not only that uncivilized tribes are capable of
entertaining the theistic conception of the world, but also that not a few of them when first found
actually possessed remarkably high and pure con
ceptions of the Supreme Spirit and of man s rela tion to him. Thus he cites Livingstone as saying that &quot; the uncontaminated African believes that the
Great Spirit lives above the stars.&quot; In trying to
prove the absence of prayer among certain savages,
he admits witnesses who show that the Esquimos, the North American Indians, and the Caribs be lieved in the existence of a Supreme Spirit, the
&quot; Master of Life.&quot; He even quotes the following
objection to prayer made by Tomochichi, the chief of the Yamacraws, to General Oglethorpe, to wit :
&quot; That the asking of any particular blessing looked
to him like directing God ; and if so, that it must
be a very wicked thing. That for his part he thought everything that happened in the world was as it should be ; that God of himself would do for every
one what was consistent with the good of the whole ; and that our duty to him was to be content with whatever happened in general, and thankful for all the good that happened in particular.&quot; What civil ized religionist, what purest monotheist, ever appre
hended or expressed this theological problem more clearly than did this Indian chief? Lubbock quotes another author as saying that the Caribs considered the Great Spirit as endowed with so great good

ness that he does not take revenge even on his ene mies. 1 So Mr. Tylor allows not only that most barbarians are able to conceive of a Creator, but also that they
actually believe in one. He says :
&quot;Races of North and South America, of Africa,
of Polynesia, recognizing a number of great deities, are usually and reasonably considered polytheists, yet their acknowledgment of a Supreme Creator would entitle them at the same time to the name of
monotheists,&quot; if belief in a Supreme Deity, held to be the Creator of the world and chief of the spiritual
hierarchy, were the sufficient criterion of monothe
ism. &quot; High above the doctrine of souls, of divine
manes, of local nature-spirits, of the great deities of class and element, there are to be discerned in sav
age theology shado wings, quaint or majestic, of the conception of a Supreme Deity.&quot;
2
He illustrates the prevalence of this conception by facts related of barbarous peoples in almost
every quarter of the globe. Speaking of the re markable clearness of this idea and belief among
the New Zealanders, the Hawaiians, the Tongans, Samoans, and other representatives of the Polyne sian race, he says : &quot; Students of the science of religion who hold
polytheism to be but the misdevelopment of a primal idea of divine unity, which in spite of cor
ruption continues to pervade it, might well choose this South Sea Island divinity as their aptest illus
tration from the savage world.&quot; 3

EARLIEST FORM OF RELIGION. 401
He quotes Moerenhout as saying : &quot; Taaroa is their supreme, or rather only, God ;
for all the others, as in other known polytheisms,
seem scarcely more than sensible figures and im ages of the infinite attributes united in his divine
person.&quot;
He adds the following sublime native description
of this Supreme God :
&quot; He was ; Taaroa was his name ; he abode in the void. No earth, no sky, no men. Taaroa calls, but naught answers ; and alone existing he became the
universe&quot; (p. 345).
Though an outspoken opponent of the theory that polytheism arose from moral and spiritual degenera
tion, his own facts are so strong that for the expla nation of some of them he is constrained to resort
to it. Speaking of the &quot;conceptions of the Supreme Deity in the savage and barbaric world,&quot; he says,
&quot; The degeneration theory may claim such beliefs as mutilated and perverted remnants of higher re ligions, in some instances no doubt with justice.&quot;
That a religion originally good and pure may de generate and become corrupt is conceded even by Lubbock. At the close of his sketch of &quot; the low
est intellectual stages through which religion has
passed,&quot; he uses this significant language : &quot; I have stopped short sooner, perhaps, than I should otherwise have done, because the worship of
personified principles, such as Fear, Love, Hope, etc., could not have been treated apart from that of the Phallus, or Lingam, with which it was so inti mately associated in Greece, India, Mexico, and else where ; and which, though at first modest and pure,
as all religions are in their origin, led to such
26



4O2 PARADISE FOUND.
abominable practices that it is one of the most pain
ful chapters in human history.&quot;
l
Reading this, the disciple of history simply asks,
If men could so corrupt the originally modest and
pure worship of Aphrodite, why not also the origi nally pure worship of El ? Sixthly. The disclosure of the Arctic Eden solves
all further difficulties in the Hebrew conception of
the religious development of mankind. This doctrine as to the cradle of the race con
cedes to the devotee of prehistoric archaeology all his
claims as to the lowly beginnings of every historic
civilization developed in our postdiluvian seats of humanity. It welcomes every revelation which fossil
bone, or chipped flint, or lacustrine pile, or sepul chral mound has ever made, finding in it precious illustration of those &quot; times of ignorance
&quot;
through which our expatriated race has made its passage
(Acts xvii. 30; Rom. i. 18-32). It is equally ready for every conclusion of the scientific anthropologist.
By his own doctrine of the power of environment,
and by his own picture of Mammalian life in Ter
tiary and Quaternary times, it constrains him to admit that if the Eden of Genesis was at the Pole, the Biblical picture of Antediluvian Man, with his
extraordinary vigor and stature and longevity, with his extraordinary defiance of the authority of God, and with his extraordinary persistence in the in dulgence of self-centred passions and appetites and
ambitions, is credible in the highest degree. And that nothing may be lacking to its perfect confirma tion, the comparative mythologist discovers that in this new Eden he is given the master-key to his
l Origin of Civilization, p. 350.



EARLIEST FORM OF RELIGION. 403
own science, and that every great system of ancient
mythology and of mythological geography must now be freshly and intelligently interpreted in the light of it. The old, old stories of a Golden Age, of the
Hesperidian Gardens, of the Tree of Golden Fruit, of the Hyperborean Macrobii, of the insurrection of the Titans, of the destruction of mankind by a
Flood, are history once more. Their authenticity as history is attested by new and unchangeable evi dences, by witnesses as unbribable as the axis
of the earth and the pole of the heavens. No more
can the investigator of the history and philosophy of religion rule out the ancient myths of humanity as senseless, or seek to interpret them as results of
an inevitable &quot; disease of language.&quot; No more can
they be palmed off upon us as capricious variations of that myth of dawn, or of the sun, or of the storm,
which we are told that the fancy of &quot;
primitive
&quot;
men is ever weaving. They are simply blurred chapters from the neglected and abused and almost lost Bible of the Gentiles, confirming and establish
ing the opening chapters of our own. Summing up, then, we see : I. That in rejecting
the historical conception of the primeval religious
belief of mankind Hume took up a position which none of his own successors consider as at all tena
ble. 2. The further these successors have carried their revolt against history, the more have they become involved in contradiction with each other.
3. The more consistently and radically the dogma of primitive savagery has been carried out, the more inevitably has it landed its advocates in the doctrine
of primitive bestiality.



404 PARADISE FOUND.
4. In their eagerness to destroy the possibility or credibility of primeval monotheism, these more con sistent and radical theorists have inadvertently gone so far as to render a self-consistent evolutional biol
ogy or sociology impossible. 5. In consequence hereof the more clear-sighted of the representatives of Darwinism are just now
deftly re-approaching the long-scouted historic con ception, by representing the first men as superior to the modern savage in intellectual endowment, by
calling their powers high, by considering their judg ments of natural objects substantially correct, by admitting their knowledge of the true and normal
form of the family, by conceding to them a truly hu
man appreciation of ethical excellences and obliga
tions, by allowing to them a capacity to conceive of
an almighty Supreme Spirit, the Author and right ful Governor of the world, and by recognizing that
nearly all religions present clear traces of corrup tion. So far as principles are concerned these rep resentations surrender their whole case. With these data Adamic Revelation becomes quite as possible and quite as credible as Abrahamic, or Mosaic, or Christian Revelation.
6. The Anlage for religion is no product of age
long advances in civilization and in the arts. The
unclad Adam of the garden was no more incapaci tated for the knowledge of his Father than was that naked second Adam, for whose advent Mary pro vided the swaddling-clothes. If the former seems
too undeveloped to be an organ of divine revelation,
the latter, the highest of all these organs, the abso
lute Revelator, began quite as low. If nomad Arabs of to-day can see in storm and stars sublime mani*



EARLIEST FORM OF RELIGION. 405
festations of one almighty personal Power, why could
not the nomadic Abel as well ? If the Gospel mes senger of to-day can cause the rudest Fijian to know
God and to experience a sense of divine forgiveness and favor, why may not God s earliest preachers of
righteousness have produced a like effect on sincere souls before the .discovery of the art of metal-work
ing ? Once let the anthropological and sociolog ical postulates demanded even by Herbert Spencer be granted, and the ancient historic conception of Primitive Monotheism becomes both possible and eminently reasonable. As an escape from the con flicting and mutually destructive theories of the nat
uralistic school in its different departments, it pre
sents, on merely speculative grounds, a positive attractiveness. Its full array of evidences, however, is simply co-extensive and identical with the evi dences for the reality of Historic Revelation as a
whole. Everything which goes to show that God has intelligibly revealed himself to men at all bears
more or less directly upon the credibility of a Reve
lation &quot; in the beginning?
7. Lastly, the Arctic Eden completes the recon ciliation of Biblical and secular learning in their re
lations to the problem of the primitive religion of
men. As we have seen, both science and theology
now find in this primeval Bildungsherd at the Pole the one prolific centre whence all the floral and faunal and human life-forms of the whole earth have
proceeded. In an &quot; environment&quot; of such crea
tively potent, world -overflowing nature - forces as were there, any culmination of life s manifestations short of a &quot; Golden Race &quot; of men, kingly in stature,
Rishis in intelligence, measuring their Deva-Yike

lives by centuries, would have been an incongruity.
That a loving Creator creating because loving should have put himself into instant personal com munion with these highest of his creatures, moral natures fashioned in his own image and after his
likeness, children of his love, is to a theist, even
an ethnic theist, the only credible representation. That such a lusty race should have been open to
temptation on the line of apparently innocent aspira tion after still higher perfections, that they should have desired to &quot;be as gods,&quot; that they should have
coveted experimental and personal knowledge of
evil as well as of good, these are suppositions
which no serious anthropologist will pronounce in admissible. That the actual revolt of such an order of moral agents from the true law and basis of its life should have carried into its subsequent historic
developments consequences of profoundest import is as much a necessary implication of the law of hered ity and of the established constitution of nature as it is an instinctive inference from the preconceived character of a perfect Moral Governor. Given such antediluvian men, one must pronounce the history of antediluvian religion, as reported in the oldest memories and in the most sacred scriptures of hu
manity, a self-attesting chronicle.

hyena and the cave-bear, fiercer and more powerful than the modern type. His multitudinous enemies were all provided with offensive and defensive armor, with tusk and fang, with claw and beak,
with lances steeped in never-failing deadliest poi sons. To every foe they could oppose an almost
impenetrable hide, a mail of horny scales, a solid shell. He, by strangest anomaly, was destitute of
all. He was a naked and defenseless babe in the Indian jungle of Earth s fierce and venomous car
nivora. He had not a weapon, not an implement with which to shape one. Even had he had imple ments ever so good, he would not have known enough to fashion himself the rudest club from the
branch of a tree. He had not yet

well as nature kept his eyes fixed upon the ground.&quot; As we saw in the preceding chapter, he supposed that &quot; the branches of the trees extended quite to
heaven, hiding themselves in infinitely remote ethereal regions.&quot; Indeed, according to some of these advocates, this precious &quot;primitive man&quot; could
not distinguish a tree when he saw it. He was not at all certain that its outspreading roots and branches were not the legs and arms of a fellow-man who
happened to grow in that particular way. So says a

people were unable to make any conceivable distinc

sort have been a little precipitate in rejecting so de
terminedly the traditional idea of extraordinary an tediluvian longevity. For if the earliest generations of mankind were in truth such idiotic specimens as

sufficiently early how to wring a subsistence from the unfriendly soil, must give place to the still more perplexing and more fundamental problem as to the
possibility and credibility of primitive procreation
itself. To say nothing of the question as to the whence of the very first of these feeble and down
looking intelligences, it is plain that if ever they
did have successors to take up and carry forward
and upward their type of life, in some way and at
seme time within the natural life of the first individ
uals, incredible as it may be &quot; to us moderns,&quot;
it must (happily for us) have dawned upon some
man s mind, or on whatever then occupied the place of his mind, that between Daphne (or whoever was practically the first woman) and a tree some dis
tinction was discernible. And as the friends who give us such witless ancestors are prodigal to a fault in their allowance of ages of time whenever any
ordinary geological or zoological result is to be reached without troubling a Higher Power, it seems
to a calm on-looker a very penurious and illogical, not to say cruel, procedure to require these embryotic representatives of incipient humanity to create, or rather to evolve and bring to practicable perfec tion, the high arts and sciences of intelligent per
ception, of human as distinguished from dendrological physiology, of gynecology and obstetrics, all
within the few swift years of a modern human life time. With &quot;two hundred and thirty thousand to two hundred and forty thousand years

the banale hypothesis of primeval savagery have done their worst, and doing this have shattered their own party into an indefinite number of mutually an
tagonistic factions, each protesting against all who happen to be more thorough-going and radical than
themselves. Thus Spencer is in array against Mc
Lennan, Caspari protests against Mannhardt, Vogt endeavors to outdo Darwin, and so on to the end of the chapter. The modern Babel is worse than the ancient. To one surveying at the present time the different departments of science which relate to Man, it would seem as though in each the break down of the theory of primitive human brutishness

same rate through all the past, and have been warranted never to stop, or to want winding up, or to go faster or slower than at the moment the observer was looking at them. Such attempts are so obviously futile that it is not a little strange to find them seriously made by men like

tient and often contradictory utterances of represen tative leaders, would be most timely, but the task must be left to other and more competent hands.
Here, foregoing all exposures of such a kind, we will simply suggest to the reader a few obviously important memoranda : 1. Considered in the light of antecedent proba
bilities, there is no discoverable reason, or apol ogy for a reason, why the first Homines should have
been but half-witted, any more than those perfect Nautili which, ages earlier, with astounding skill navigated the old Silurian seas. 1
2. Given Human beings, normally endowed at the
beginning, and we see experience everywhere show ing how all the savagery of past and present history
could easily and naturally have originated simply from disregard of natural and moral law.
3. Given at the beginning nothing but Animal powers, and we find nothing in the whole range of
experience, from the first dawn of history until now,
paralleling or in any wise rendering intelligible the
hypothetical biological legerdemain of Nature by which these zoologic powers were once, and once only, transmuted into Human. 2
1 Since these pages were placed in the printer s hands the follow ing has appeared in the scientific journals :
&quot; A discovery by Dr.
Lindstrom in the Silurian rocks of Gotland is worthy of special notice. In beds which are said to be the equivalent of our Niagara group
he has discovered a remarkably well-preserved scorpion. Dr. Thorell, one of the foremost students of Arachnida in the world, and Dr. Lindstrom are preparing a paper upon it, and have given it the name
of Paleophoneus nuncius. No scorpions, nor indeed any Arachnida, have before been found fossil in beds lower than the carboniferous deposits, in which some twenty-five species have been found in this country and Europe ; yet this Silurian example is more perfect than
Q.ny specimen of a fossil scorpion from any formation&quot; 2

4. If Paleontology presents to us certain types of life which indicate in their successions a certain
progress, it must not be forgotten that the same science presents us other types, whose successions
with equal clearness reveal a progressive degeneracy
and an ultimate disappearance. The movement may be forward, but it may also be backward. &quot; As
to the class Reptilia,&quot; says Sir Charles Lyell, &quot;some
of the orders which prevailed when the Secondary
rocks were formed are confessedly much higher in their organization than any of the same class now
living. If the less perfect Ophidians, or snakes,
which now abound on earth had taken the lead in those ancient days among the land reptiles, and the Deinosaurians had been contemporary with Man, there can be no doubt that the progressionist would have seized upon this fact with unfeigned satisfac
tion as confirmatory of his views. Now that the order of succession is precisely reversed, and that
origin to a protoplasmic germ, in which are contained all the possi bilities of his after development, is no piece of scientific romance, but demonstrable truth. . . . All forms of protoplasm, however alike in appearance and composition science may and does declare them to be, are not identical in their potentialities. They do not, in other
words, all possess similar powers of becoming similar organisms. The speck which remains an Amoeba has no power of evolving from its substance a higher form of life. The protoplasmic spore of a sea weed is a seaweed still, despite its similarity to other or higher forms
of plant-germs. The germ of the sponge, again, remains possessed
of the powers which can convert it into a sponge alone. And the differences between such protoplasmic specks and the germ which is destined to evolve the human frame can only be declared as of im mense extent, and as equaling in their nature the wide structural and functional distinctions which we draw betwixt the sponge and the man. Of such differences in the inherent nature of protoplasm un

of the Eocene palaeophis and the living boa, while the crocodile is in our own times the highest repre sentative of its class, a retrograde movement in this important division of the vertebrata must be admit
ted.&quot; l With this agrees the emphatic declaration of
Andrew Wilson :
&quot; A study of the facts of animal development is well calculated to show that life is
not all progress, and that it includes retrogression as well as advance. Physiological history can read ily be proved to tend in many cases towards back
sliding instead of reaching forwards and upwards to
higher levels. This tendency, beginning now to be better recognized in biology than in late years, can readily be shown to exercise no unimportant influ ence on the fortunes of animals and plants.&quot;
2 In
view of these facts of retrogression, the latest writers
on the history of life on our planet, even when pro
fessing, with the last-quoted author, to accept of Darwin s philosophy as true, are at the same time
very generally saying,
&quot; It cannot be the whole
truth.&quot; 3

&quot; The flora of the whole Paleozoic period ... is very distinct from that of succeeding times. Still, the
leading families of Rhizocarpea, j&quisetacea, Lycopodiacece, Filicea, and Conifera, established in Paleozoic times, still remain, and the changes which have occurred consist mainly in the degradation of the

5. Again, by the same testimony of the rocks, life need not, of necessity, either advance or retreat ;
it may stand as first originated from age to age. Says Professor Nicholson, &quot;There are various groups,
some of them highly organized, which make their
appearance at an extremely ancient date, but which continue throughout geological time almost un
changed, and certainly unprogressive. Many of these Persistent Types are known, and they indicate that
under given conditions, at present unknown to us, it is possible for a life-form to subsist for an almost
indefinite period without any important modification
of its structure.&quot; 1
6. All arguments for the alleged self-evolution of
the Human Race out of preceding animal races, based upon an alleged universal and uniformly pro gressive self-evolution of life-forms in the animal
kingdom, are, in view of the above facts, arguments
originating in ignorance or in fraud. 7. According to the teachers of the current ag nostic anthropology and atheistic history, modern

Godward, is to a truly scientific and philosophic eye
full of significance. The slightest study of the man ifestations of this power in history inwardly convicts Us of unfaithfulness, as a race, to the true law of our
being. We cannot help feeling that we ought to be lords of Nature. Our actual relation to the cosmic forces is not, and in historic time never has been, the ideal and true relation. It was no narrow
minded &quot; bibliolater &quot; who penned the following ex
pression of this feeling ; it was Ralph Waldo Emer son :
&quot; As we degenerate, the contrast between us
and our house is more evident. We are as much
strangers in Nature as we are aliens from God. We do not understand the notes of birds. The fox and the deer run away from us ; the bear and the tiger
rend us. . . . Man is a god in ruins. When men
are innocent, life shall be longer, and shall pass into the immortal as gently as we awake from dreams.
Man is the dwarf of himself. Once he was perme
ated and dissolved by spirit. At present he applies to Nature but half his force. . . . Meantime, in the
thick darkness, there are not wanting gleams of a better light, occasional examples of the action of
man upon Nature with his entire force. Such exam ples are the traditions of MIRACLES in the antiquity
of all nations, the HISTORY OF JESUS CHRIST, the
achievements of a principle in political revolutions, the miracles of enthusiasm, the wisdom of children.
. . . The problem of restoring to the world original
and eternal beauty is solved by the redemption of the
soul&quot;
The above is an utterance as true and deep as it
is beautiful and poetic. And here in this ancient and Biblical conception of Man s relation to Nature 27

is given the sun-clear solution of the whole contro versy between the advocates of universal racial and
technological degeneration, on the one hand, and the advocates of universal racial and technological pro
gression, on the other. Both parties are right and
both are wrong. The one has vindicated and em phasized one vital class of facts ; the other, another
class equally vital. Christian thought interprets and harmonizes them both. It shows us through all hu man history racial and social and technological deca
dence wherever men have rejected or ignored God. It shows us, on the other hand, racial and social and technological progress wherever men have acknowl
edged and lovingly served that Divine One in whom
we live and move and have our being. Here, then, is the law of true human progress. As Emerson in his more Christian moods would put it, The res
toration of the lost harmony between Man and his House must begin with the Redemption of his Soul. As to the primeval condition of our race, a truly scientific mind will wish to base its conception not
on the air-hung speculations of mere theorists, but on an immovable foundation of fact, attested and con firmed by the widest, oldest, and most incontestable
of all concurrences of divine and human testimony.

moral experiences. It boldly asserts that, accord
ing to every principle of just analogy, the notion
that it took the earliest men one hundred thousand years to get an idea of the conditions of normal in
tellectual, and ethical, and social living is as incredi ble as that it took the first-born mammal one hun dred thousand years to find its mother s milk. It calls attention to the fact that all the oldest historic
peoples of every continent unite in the testimony
that the first men had knowledge of superhuman
personalities, good and evil. It dwells upon the equally universal tradition that primeval human life,
while progressive in everything which accumulating
human experience would of necessity improve, was yet from the first the life of decidedly super-bestial, almost god-like intelligences, as daring ultimately in evil as potent originally for good. It holds on the same authority that after centuries and possibly mil lenniums of such history as great natures undisci plined by virtue are ever reproducing, the social
organism was incurably corrupted and the moral
world-order itself defied. As Plato s Egyptian priests told Solon, &quot; the divine portion in human nature faded out ;
&quot; the purely human &quot; gained the upper
hand,&quot; and, spoiled by the very excellence of their
fortune, &quot; men became unseemly. To him who had an eye to see they appeared base, and had lost the
fairest of their precious gifts. They still appeared
glorious and blessed, at the very time when they were filled with unrighteous avarice and violence.

that haply He might recall them to that earlier and
better life, when they had &quot; despised everything but virtue, neither were intoxicated by luxury ;
&quot; when,
being &quot; possessed of true and great spirits, they prac ticed gentleness and wisdom in their intercourse with one another ;
&quot; when they
&quot; were obedient to the laws and well affectioned toward the gods.&quot;
l
These gracious endeavors of Divine compassion
proving fruitless, the integrity of the world s ra tional purpose and significance could be conserved
only by penalty, and by a new moral and physi
cal conditioning of the race. No change of moral administration could suffice, since every wise appli ance of merefy moral influence and instruction had
been exhausted. A new physical environment and conditioning was essential to the new moral methods which, in this critical juncture, Humanity was need
ing. The inbringing of such a new physical envi
ronment would of itself carry to human consciences, individual and social, the profoundest and most ef fectual of moral meanings. Both the physical and the moral change came in that world-convulsion
which Plato calls &quot;the Great Deluge of all.&quot; In it
perished what Hesiod and Ovid and so many others
called the &quot; Golden Race &quot; of men, the first, the
fairest, the strongest, the longest-lived of all that ever bore the human form divine. Under its waters
were engulfed precious accumulations of science, the primordial creations of art, the incunabula of all literature. So sore was this loss of man s costliest possessions that either myth or truthful history has

filled the early Shemitic world with the pathetic story that the God of gods, while arranging for the
righteous judgment upon the ungodly, Himself still so compassionated the successors and heirs of its
unhappy victims as to command the patriarchal
minister of His will to make an indestructible mon umental record of all that the progenitors of a new Humanity would need to know. 1
The new physical conditions under which the race was placed were the conditions brought in by
the Diluvian cataclysm. They involved (i) expa triation, the great Glacial Age compelling an entire abandonment of the mother-region of the human
family ; (2) dispersion, the frozen and sterilized con dition of even what is now the North Temperate
zone rendering the struggle for the means of subsist ence a most arduous and difficult one ; (3) deterio
ration of physical constitution corresponding to the biological conditions of the new and deteriorated en vironment ; and (4), as a natural consequence of the whole, an abbreviation of the normal longevity pre viously enjoyed. Being at the same time reduced to the lowest social unit in the way of organization,
the Family, and being, in consequence of the poverty of Nature s provision, compelled to spread
in proportion as it multiplied, the new Humanity of
&quot; the world which now is
&quot; was signally guarded against the repetition of those insolent and Goddefying forms of sin in consequence of which a nemesis of cosmical proportions had overtaken the antediluvian world.2

Such is the conception of primeval human history
which the oldest traditions of the oldest nations set over against this late-born dream of &quot;
primitive savagery.&quot; It is the conception of the whole Chris tian world of the whole Jewish world of the
Mohammedan world of the ancient Greek and
Roman world of the world of the eldest Asiatic
and Egyptian antiquity. It is the irrefutable Selbst
zetigniss of the Human Race respecting facts of
which it has the knowledge of a living and most in terested participating witness. 1 According to the results of this treatise the primitive seat of the world s first civilization was outside the boundaries of all lands known to record
ed history. This being so, Mr. Tylor s confident
challenge has for the present quite lost its force.

home of Man which does not show by rude stone
implements buried in its soil the savage condition of its former inhabitants ?

products wherever we may find them, but never should it be forgotten that, back of all dawnings of new knowledge and new arts here revealed, lay the
fuller knowledge and the more perfect arts of a favored antediluvian world. 1 Let no one say that the profession of such an
opinion betrays the prejudice of a Christian educa tion ; that it is ignoring the fruits of a century s
study ; that it is simply repristinating the doctrine
1 In his late work, entitled India: What can it teach us? (Lon don, 1883) Professor Max Mtiller well challenges the first prin ciples of our dominant school of &quot; Culture-students,&quot; as follows : &quot; What do we know of savage tribes beyond the last chapter of their
history ? Do we ever get an insight into their antecedents ? Can we understand what, after all, is everywhere the most important and
the most instructive lesson to learn, how they have come to be what they are ? There is, indeed, their language, and in it we see traces of growth that point to distant ages, quite as much as the Greek of Homer, or the Sanskrit of the Vedas. . . . Unless we admit a special creation for these savages they must be as old as the Hindus, the
Greeks, and Romans ; as old as we ourselves. We may assume, of
course, if we like, that their life has been stationary, and that they are to-day what the Hindus were no longer than three thousand years ago. But that is a mere guess, and is contradicted by the facts of their language. They may have passed through ever so many
vicissitudes, and what we consider as primitive may be, for all we know, a relapse into savagery, or a corruption of something that was more rational and intelligible in former stages. Think only of the rules that determine marriage among the lowest of savage tribes. Their complication passes all understanding. All seems a chaos of
prejudice, superstition, pride, vanity, and stupidity. And yet we catch a glimpse here and there that there was some reason in most of that unreason ; we see how sense dwindled away into nonsense, custom into ceremony, ceremony into force. Why, then, should this
surface of savage life represent to us the lowest stratum of human
life, the very beginnings of civilization, simply because we cannot dig beyond that surface ?
&quot; A hundred years hence the story that the
wise men of the nineteenth century sought to reconstruct the begin
nings of human history by the study of the lowest contemporary savages will be one of the choicest of popular illustrations of the folly of &quot; ante-scientific times.&quot;

of a forgotten Goguet, and seeking to resurrect the long dead Banier. If any reader is tempted to such
utterances, it is possible that an imaginary conversa tion may help him to juster conclusions.
Let us fancy ourselves at Cnossus, upon the shores of Crete, hundreds of years before the Chris
tian era. A traveler has just landed, a Greek from Athens, intent upon visiting the celebrated
temple and cave of Zeus. As he is walking to the
temple he falls in with two companions, the one an intelligent Cretan, the other a traveler from Lacedaemon. After due salutations they naturally dis course of the laws and institutions of the country, of their origin, and of the origin of all states and
laws and civilizations. And this we may imagine is a part of their conversation : The Athenian : Do you believe that there is any truth in ancient traditions ? The Cretan : What traditions ? Ath. The traditions about the many destructions
of mankind which have been occasioned by deluges and diseases, and in many other ways, and of the
preservation of a remnant. Cr. Every one is disposed to believe them. Ath. Let us imagine one of them : I will take the famous one which was caused by a Deluge.
Cr. What is to be remarked thereon ? Ath. I should say that those who then escaped
would only be hill shepherds, small sparks of the
human race preserved on the tops of mountains.
Such survivors would necessarily be unacquainted with the arts of those who live in cities, and with the various devices which are suggested to them by
interest or ambition, and all the wrongs which they contrive against one another.



ORIGIN OF CIVILIZATION 425
Cr. Very true. Ath. Let us suppose, then, that the cities in the
plains and on the sea-coast were utterly destroyed
at that time. Would not all implements perish and every other excellent invention of political or any
other sort of wisdom utterly fail at that time ?
Cr. Why, yes ; and if things had always con
tinued as they are at present ordered, how could any discovery have ever been made even in the least particular ? For it is evident that the arts were un known during thousands and thousands of years.
And no more than a thousand or two thousand years have elapsed since the discoveries of Dae
dalus, Orpheus and Palamedes, since Marsyas and Olympus invented music, and Amphion the lyre, not to speak of numberless other inventions which are but of yesterday. Ath. Have you forgotten the name of a friend
who is really of yesterday ? Cr. I suppose that you mean Epimenides.
Ath. The same, my friend ; for his ingenuity does
indeed far overleap the heads of all your great men ; what Hesiod had preached of old, he carried out in
practice, as you declare. Cr. Yes, according to our tradition. Ath. After the great destruction, may we not
suppose that the state of man was something of this sort. In the beginning of things there was a fearful illimitable desert and a vast expanse of land ; a herd or two of oxen would be the only survivors of the animal world ; and there might be a few
goats, hardly enough to support the life of those
who tended them. Cr. True.



426 PARADISE FOUND.
Ath. And of cities or governments or legislation,
about which we are now talking, do you suppose that they could have any recollection at all ?
Cr. They could not.
Ath. And out of this state of things has there not sprung all that we now are and have : cities and
governments, and arts and laws, and a great deal of vice and a great deal of virtue ? Cr. What do you mean ?
Ath. Why, my good friend, how can we possibly
suppose that those who knew nothing of all the good and evil of cities could have attained their full
development, whether of virtue or of vice ?
Cr. I understand your meaning, and you are quite
right. Ath. But, as time advanced and the race multi plied, the world came to be what the world is. Cr. Very true. Ath. Doubtless the change was not made all in
a moment, but little by little, during a very long period of time.
Cr. That is to be supposed. Ath. At first they would have a natural fear ring ing in their ears which would prevent their descend
ing from the heights into the plain. Cr. Of course. Ath. The fewness of the survivors would make them desirous of intercourse with one another ; but then the means of traveling either by land or by sea would have been almost entirely lost with the loss of
the arts, and there would be great difficulty in getting at one another ; for iron and brass and all metals would have become confused, and would have dis
appeared ; nor would there be any possibility of ex



ORIGIN OF CIVILIZATION. 427
tracting them ; and they would have no means of
felling timber. Even if you suppose that some im
plements might have been preserved in the moun
tains, they would quickly have worn out and disap
peared, and there would be no more of them until
the art of metallurgy had again revived. Cr. There could not have been. Ath. In how many generations would this be at tained ?
Cr. Clearly not for many generations.
Ath. During this period, and for some time after wards, all the arts which require iron and brass and
the like would disappear.
Cr. Certainly. Ath. Faction and war would also have died out in those days and for many reasons.
Cr. How would that be ? Ath. In the first place, the desolation of these primitive men would create in them a feeling of af fection and friendship towards one another ; and, in the second place, they would have no occasion to fight for their subsistence, for they would have
pasture in abundance, except just at first, and in
some particular cases ; on this pasture-land they would mostly support life in a primitive age, having plenty of milk and flesh, and procuring other food
by the chase, not to be despised either in quantity or quality. They would also have abundance of
clothing, and bedding, and dwellings, and utensils either capable of standing on the fire or not ; for
the plastic and weaving arts do not require any use
of iron : God has given these two arts to man in
order to provide him with necessaries, that, when reduced to their last extremity, the human race may

still grow and increase. Hence in those days man kind were not very poor ; nor was poverty a cause of difference among them ; and rich they could not
be, if they had no gold or silver, and such at that
time was their condition. And the community
which has neither poverty nor riches will always
have the noblest principles, there is no insolence
or injustice; nor, again, are there any contentions
or envyings among them. And therefore they were good, and also because they were what is called simple-minded ; and when they were told about good and evil, they in their simplicity believed what
they heard to be very truth and practiced it. No one had the wit to suspect another of a falsehood, as men do now ; but what they heard about gods
and men they believed to be true and lived accord
ingly ; and therefore they were in all respects such as we have described them. Cr. That quite accords with my views, and with those of my friend here.
Ath. Would not many generations living on in a simple manner, although ruder, perhaps, and more
ignorant of the arts generally, and in particular of those of land or naval warfare, and likewise of other
arts, termed in cities legal practices and party con flicts, and including all conceivable ways of hurting one another in word and deed ; although inferior to those who lived before the Deluge, or to the men of
our day in these respects, would they not, I say, be
simpler and more manly, and also more temperate, and in general more just? The reason has been
already explained. Cr. Very true. Ath. I should wish you to understand that what



ORIGIN OF CIVILIZATION. 429
has preceded and what is about to follow has been, and will be, said with the intention of explaining what need the men of that time had of laws, and
who was their lawgiver.
Cr. And thus far what you have said has been
very well said. Ath. They could hardly have wanted lawgivers as
yet ; nothing of that sort was likely to have existed
in their days, for they had no letters at this early stage ; they lived by habit and the customs of their
forefathers, as they are called.
Cr. Probably. Ath. But there was already existing a form of
government which, if I am not mistaken, is gener ally termed a lordship, and this still remains in
many places, both among Hellenes and barbarians,
and is the government which is declared by Homer
to have prevailed among the Cyclopes : &quot; They have neither councils nor judgments, but they dwell in hollow rocks on the tops of high
mountains, and every one is the judge of his wife and children, and they do not trouble themselves
about one another.&quot;
Cr. That must be a charming poet of yours ; I have read some other verses of his, which are very clever ; but I do not know much of him, for foreign poets are little read among the Cretans. The Laced&monian. But they are in Lacedaemon, and he appears to be the prince of them all ; the manner of life, however, which he describes is not Spartan, but rather Ionian, and he seems quite to confirm what you are saying, tracing up the ancient state of mankind by the help of tradition to bar barism.



43O PARADISE FOUND.
Ath. Yes ; and we may accept his witness to the
fact that there was a time when primitive societies had this form.
Cr. Very true.
Ath. And did not such states spring out of single habitations and families who were scattered and thinned in the devastations ; and the eldest of them was their ruler, because with them government orig inated in the authority of a father and a mother,
whom, like a flock of birds, they followed, forming
one troop under the patriarchal rule and sovereignty of their parents, which of all sovereignties is the
most just ?
Cr. Very true.
Ath. After this they came together in greater numbers, and increased the size of their cities, and
betook themselves to husbandry, first of all at the
foot of the mountains, and made inclosures of loose walls and works of defense, in order to keep off wild
beasts ; thus creating a single large and common habitation.
Cr. Yes ; at least we may suppose it. Ath. There is another thing which would prob
ably happen.
Cr. What?
Ath. When these larger habitations grew up out of the lesser original ones, each of the lesser ones would survive in the larger ; every family would be under the rule of the eldest, and, owing to their sep aration from one another, would have peculiar cus toms in things divine and human, which they would have received from their several parents who had educated them, and these customs would incline them to order, when the parents had the element of



ORIGIN OF CIVILIZATION. 431
order in them ; and to courage, when they had the
element of courage in them. And they would natu
rally stamp upon their children, and upon their chil dren s children, their own institutions ; and, as we are saying, they would find their way into the larger
society, having already their own peculiar laws.
Cr. Certainly.
Ath. And every man surely likes his own laws best, and the laws of others not so well. Cr. True. Ath. Then how we seem to have stumbled upon
the beginnings of legislation !
Cr. Exactly. Ath. The next step will be that these persons who meet together must choose some arbiters, who will
inspect the laws of all of them, and will publicly pre sent such of them as they approve to the chiefs who lead the tribes, and are in a manner their kings, and will give them the choice of them. These will them
selves be called legislators, and will appoint the mag
istrates, framing some sort of aristocracy, or perhaps monarchy, out of the dynasties or lordships, and in this altered state of the government they will live.
Cr. Yes, they would be appointed in the order which you mention. . . . But we will not pursue the conversation farther.
Is the reader indignant that he has been made to
listen so long to Abbe Banier, clumsily disguised in the robes of a pretended Athenian philosopher and
discoursing, all out of character, on matters which betray &quot;the prejudices of a Christian education&quot;? It may well be. To a reader of Lubbock and Tylor and Vogt, the sentiments of the Athenian traveler
do seem singularly in accord with Holy Scripture.

But let not the innocent suffer for the guilty. It happens that our imaginary conversation is not of our imagining. It was written more than two thou
sand years before the birth of Abbe Banier, and by as good a pagan as the famed Athenian Plato.
On the whole, we are of the opinion that the
great consentaneous Traditions of the Human Race will yet outlive a considerable number of Bachofens and Biichners and Buckles, and that if ever the bur ial-place of Moses shall be discovered, it will not be
found to be in any of the ignominious graveyards periodically prepared for him by on-coming Profes

The documents embedded in the opening chapters of Genesis may yet prove to be, what rev erent and orthodox scholars have already affirmed
fragments of the Sacred Scriptures of the Ante diluvian Patriarchal Church.1 Whether so or no, one ancient word shall evermore be verified :
&quot; The grass withereth, the flower fadeth ; but the word of our

Our treatise opened with a pathetic picture, it must close with another. Long-lost Eden is found ; but its gates are barred against us. Now, as at the

Sadder yet, it is Eden no longer.

Happily for us, O Menschengeschlecht, a trusty hand has added to the third of Genesis the closing

APPENDIX.
SECTION I. THE EARTH OF COLUMBUS NOT A TRUE SPHERE.
(Illustrating pp. 3-7 ; 306, 307.)
THE following authentic account of the views enter tained by Columbus respecting the figure of the Earth will be welcome to many readers : &quot; I have always read that the world comprising the land and the water was spherical, and the recorded expe riences of Ptolemy and all others have proved this by the eclipses of the moon and other observations made from East to West, as well as the elevation of the Pole from North to South. But as I have already described, I have now seen so much irregularity, that I have come to an
other conclusion respecting the Earth, namely, that it is not round as they describe, but of the form of a pear, which is very round except where the stalk grows, at which part it is most prominent ; or like a round ball
upon part of which is a prominence like a woman s nipple, this protrusion being the highest and nearest the sky, sit uated under the equinoctial line, and at the eastern ex tremity of this sea. ... In confirmation of my opinion, I revert to the arguments which I have above detailed respecting the line, which passes from North to South a hundred leagues westward of the Azores ; for in sailing
thence westward, the ships went on rising smoothly to wards the sky, and then the weather was felt to be milder, on account of which mildness the needle shifted one point



436 APPENDIX.
of the compass ; and the further we went, the more the needle moved to the Northwest, this elevation producing the variation of the circle which the North-star describes
with its satellites ; and the nearer I approached the equi noctial line the more they rose and the greater was the difference in these stars and in their circles. Ptolemy and the other philosophers who have written upon the
globe thought that it was spherical, believing that this [western] hemisphere was round as well as that in which they themselves dwelt, the centre of which was in the island of Arin, which is under the equinoctial line be tween the Arabian Gulf and the Gulf of Persia ; and the
circle passes over Cape St. Vincent in Portugal westward, and eastward by Cangara and the Seras ; in which
hemisphere I make no difficulty as to its being a perfect sphere as they describe; but this western half of the world I maintain is like half of a very round pear, hav
ing a raised projection for the stalk, as I have already
described, or like a woman s nipple on a round ball. Ptolemy and the others who have written on the globe had no information respecting this part of the world, which was then unexplored ; they only established their
own hemisphere, which, as I have already said, is half of a perfect sphere. And now that your Highnesses have commissioned me to make this voyage of discovery, the truths which I have stated are evidently proved, because in this voyage, when I was off the island of Hargin l and
its vicinity, which is twenty degrees to the North of the equinoctial line, I found the people black and the land very much burnt ; and when after that I went to the Cape Verde Islands I found the people there very much darker still, and the more southward we went, the more they ap proach the extreme of blackness ; so that when I reached
the parallel of Sierra Leone, where, as night came on, the North star rose five degrees, the people there were exces

HOW THE EARTH WAS PEOPLED. 437
sively black, and as I sailed westward the heat became ex treme. But after I had passed the meridian or line which I have already described, I found the climate became gradually more temperate ; so that when I reached the island of Trinidad, where the North star rose five degrees as night came on, there, and in the land of Gracia, I found the temperature exceedingly mild ; the fields and the foliage likewise were remarkably fresh and green, and
as beautiful as the gardens of Valencia in April. The
people there are very graceful in form, less dark than
those whom I had before seen in the Indies, and wear their hair long and smooth ; they are also more shrewd,
intelligent, and courageous. The sun was then in the sign of Virgo over our heads and theirs ; therefore all this must proceed from the extreme blandness of the temper
ature, which arises, as I have said, from this country be ing the most elevated in the world and the nearest to the
sky. On these grounds, therefore, I affirm that the globe is not spherical, but that there is the difference in its form which I have described ; the which is to be found in this hemisphere at the point where the Indies meet the
ocean, the extremity of the hemisphere being below the
equinoctial line. And a great confirmation of this is, that when our Lord made the sun, the first light appeared in the first point of the East, where the most elevated point of the globe is.&quot; Hakluyt Society Publications. Select Letters of Columbus. Tr. by R. H. Major. London, 2d

SECTION II. HOW THE EARTH WAS PEOPLED.
BY M. LE MARQUIS G. DE SAPORTA.
How has the human race been able to spread itself over the whole surface of the globe ? Is it the result of different and independent origins in the several con



43$ APPENDIX.
tinents, or have all men sprung from a common cradle, a
&quot;
mother-region
&quot;
? On this point students are divided,
Agassiz holding that men were created, and Carl Vogt
that they were developed, at different centres, and Qua
trefages and the theologians maintaining the unity of
their origin. The fact is left that man, the same in all the essential characteristics of the species, has advanced into all the habitable parts of the globe, and that not re cently and when provided with all the resources that experience and inventive genius could put at his disposal,
but when still young and ignorant. It was then that,
weak and almost naked, having only just got fire and a few rude arms with which to defend itself and procure
food, the human race conquered the world and spread it self from within the Arctic Circle to Terra del Fuego,
from the Samoyed country to Van Diemen s Land, from the North Cape to the Cape of Good Hope. It is this
primitive exodus, as certain as it is inconceivable, ac cepted by science as well as by dogma, that we have to explain, or at least to make probable ; and that in an age when it is only after the most wonderful discoveries, by
the aid of the most powerful machinery for navigation, through the boldest and most adventurous enterprises, that civilized man has been able to flatter himself that he has at last gone as far as infant man went in an age that is so far removed from us as to baffle all calculations.
We must insist on this point, for it brings into light an obstacle which those who have tried to trace out the con nection between widely separated races and to determine
the course that had been followed by tribes now separated by oceans and vast expanses have hitherto found insur
mountable ; for, if man is one to which we are ready
to agree we must assign a single point of departure
for his migrations. In these migrations, man has gone wherever he could, and, at every spot he has occupied and settled, has acquired characteristics peculiar to the



HOW THE EARTH WAS PEOPLED. 439
place, and which differentiated him from the men settling
in other places. Hence the varieties of human races. Some of these spots seem to have been peculiarly favor able to his advancement, and became centres of civiliza tion. The number of such centres is, however, very limited, and their distribution is significant. The continental masses are distributed in three prin
cipal groups, one feature in the configuration of which must strike every one who carefully examines a map of the world. It will be noticed that they are so expanded toward the North as to touch in that direction or be sep arated only by narrow passages, and that they also sur round within the Arctic Circle a central polar sea with a bordering island-belt. Going down toward the South we
find that the three continents, North America, Europe, and Northern Asia, which had approached each other so
closely, give place to three appendages, South America, Africa, and Australia, which in their turn gradually taper off to mere points in an illimitable sea, long before they reach the Antarctic Circle. Within this circle the con figuration of the land is precisely the reverse of that in the North j it is that of a solid cap of land around the pole, in the midst of the great ocean. If we again observe these masses, we shall find that civilization was born in each of them under similar geo
graphical conditions, viz., in the neighborhood of a smaller interior sea, near or rather North of the tropic of Cancer, between 20 and 35 north latitude. The most eastern of the centres is in China, near the Japan Sea. The
most western, and apparently the most recent, was along the inner shores of the Gulf of Mexico. The last civili zation was in the course of radiation and transformation
when the Europeans came to America, and was wholly independent and autonomous ; but, weak and relatively new, it was not able to resist the sudden onset of a
stronger race.



44O APPENDIX.
Toward the centre of the space whose extremes we have marked out must be placed two other centres of civilization, more ancient than either of the two already named, and in the same zone of latitude Egypt, in the valley of the Nile, and near the Arabian Gulf, and Meso potamia, near the head of the Persian Gulf. Thus, each
continental mass had its particular centre of civilization, except Asia, which had two one in the extreme east, the other near the line which joins it to Europe. This
peculiar grouping of the chief centres of civilization in such a relation of neighborhood constitutes the most con siderable paleoethnic fact that we are able to record. The Nile and the Syrian sea on the west, upper Armenia and the Caspian on the north, the Hindoo-Koosh and the Indus on the east, and the Arabian Sea on the south,
bound the region where Cushites, Semites, and Aryans, the first farmers, workers, and founders of cities, the sec
ond pastoral people, and the third mountaineers, after ward emigrants and conquerors, met, elbowed each other, and mingled, conquerors and conquered by turns, invent ing arts and the use of metals, learning arms and how to
organize themselves hierarchically, reaching their ideal through religion, and having in writing the most power ful instrument at the disposition of human intelligence. With them we have the beginning of history, and a con tinuous chain of social organizations, down to our own days. The growth of civilization in these centres leaves, however, still unaccounted for the diffusion of mankind all over the earth, which took place at a period far an terior to it.
The spread of man throughout Europe and Asia does not offer very great difficulties, for, in consequence of the long distance for which the two continents are joined,
Europe is in reality only a dependency of Asia ; and oc cupation of Europe from Asia is conformable to religious traditions. The difficulties are, however, formidable



HOW THE EARTH WAS PEOPLED. 441
when we come to America, which we find occupied from one end to the other by races whose unity has struck the best observers. Not only, moreover, did the American
man inaugurate on the soil of the New World an original
and relatively advanced civilization, but he has left,
chiefly in the North, indisputable traces of his presence in the most remote ages. Paleolithic implements have
been found in the valley of the Delaware, at Trenton,
New Jersey, and near Guanajuato in Mexico, so clearly characterized that they cannot be mistaken, the situation of which at the base of the Quaternary alluvions and their coexistence with elephants and mastodons indicate the existence of a race contemporaneous with that of the
gravels of the Somme, having the same industry and doubtless the same manners and physical traits. Whence could this primitive American race, sister to the one that lived in Europe at the same date, have come, unless we suppose a direct communication between the two conti nents ? The difficulty such men would have in crossing the Atlantic and the certainty which soundings give of the antiquity of the ocean remove all possibility of our believing either that the two continents were formerly joined, or that one of them was discovered by some un known Columbus navigating the ocean a hundred thou sand years before the later one.
We are thus in the presence of the problem, always coming up before us, and always escaping us, of the or igin of the American man. Evidently it cannot be re solved by invoking an accidental colonization of Asiatic
wanderers, or a shipwrecked company ; but it is one in
which we have to deal with primitive populations flowing as in Europe by successive waves, and attesting the con
tinuous presence of man, whose gradual development and extension have followed in America the same course as on the old continent. The hypothesis of an immigration from Asia by way of the Aleutian Islands to Alaska



442 APPENDIX.
might be acceptable, did not the certainty of the presence of an indigenous American population in the Quaternary age reduce it to the proportions of a secondary fact. The same is the case with the relations contradictory, it is true, and therefore suspicious which some have
attempted to establish between the monuments, statues, and graphic signs of Central America and those of Egypt and Buddhistic Asia. These analogies, aside from
their insufficiency, must fall before two paramount con
siderations : first, the certainty of the contemporaneous ness of the American man with the great animals of the
Quaternary age ; and, second, the relative uniformity of the copper-colored race, so like itself through the whole extent of the continent, except in that part which is oc
cupied by the Esquimaux. The difficulty arises from the fact that the monogenists, having in view a single birth
place and a single point of departure for the whole hu
man race, and placing neither in the New World, have supposed America to have been colonized by European or Asiatic immigrants following the direction of the par allels of latitude. Emigration in this direction at once meets an obstacle in the oceans, which grow wider the farther South we go. The obstacle disappears if we give up the idea of lateral emigrations, and suppose the move ment to have taken place in the direction of the merid ians from North to South. No obstacle of any kind offers itself to such migrations ; and the relative uniformity of the Americans, from one end of the continent to the other, would never have excited astonishment, if we had not been preoccupied with the idea of their introduction at a later date. We may remark, on this topic, that the extreme south ern points of the three continents are occupied by races which came originally, without doubt, from somewhere else, and which are ranked, in Terra del Fuego, at the Cape of Good Hope, and in Tasmania, among the lowest



HOW THE EARTH WAS PEOPLED. 443
of the species. These races, advancing in front of the others, have preserved the visible stamp of the relative
inferiority of the stock from which they were prematurely
detached. We have to believe, in effect, that these three branches Fuegians, Bushmen, and Tasmanians so
little elevated in their physical, intellectual, and moral traits, have gone and planted themselves so far away only because the unoccupied space opened out before them. Scouts for the rest of mankind, they have reached, step by step, the extreme limits of the habitable land. They must have occupied for the moment, at least, the parts of the intermediate space, but they could not resist the push of the stronger races, and they could not have survived to our time, except under the condition of re striction to a small area in the most remote tract of their
original domain. There is nothing surprising in the fact
that MM. Quatrefages and Hamy, having described the most ancient European race of which we have the skulls,
that of Canstadt, should have found its analogies only among these same natives of the extreme South the Bushmen and the Australians. It will be seen that we are inclined to remove to the
circumpolar regions of the North the probable cradle of primitive humanity. From there only could it have radi ated as from a centre, to spread into several continents at once, and to give rise to successive emigrations toward the South. This theory agrees best with the presumed
march of the human races. It remains to be shown that it is equally in accord with the most authentic and most
recent geological data, and that, besides man, it is appli cable to the plants and animals which accompanied him, and which have continued to be most closely associated with him in the temperate regions which afterward became
the seat of his civilizing power.
The general laws of geogony favor this hypothesis in a
remarkable manner. To make it seem probable, we have



444 APPENDIX.
only to establish two essential points that will not be
seriously contested by any geologist. One is, that the polar regions, which were covered with large trees, en joyed a climate more temperate than that of Central Europe, and were habitable and fertile to the eightieth
degree, underwent a slow and progressive cooling down till the middle of the Tertiary period. Thence refrigera
tion made rapid progress till the ice gained exclusive possession of the country south of them. Under such
circumstances, man as well as the animals and plants would have to remove or perish to emigrate step by step, or find himself reduced to a daily more precarious state of existence.
The second point is the relative stability of the exist ing continental masses, and of their distribution around a sea occupying the Arctic Pole ; while the other Pole was occupied with a cap of land surrounded by an immense
ocean. The importance of the Arctic Pole in respect to the production of animals and plants, and to their migra tions, and the nullity of the other hemisphere in relation to this feature result from such a grouping. The essen
tial point is, that there is nothing capricious in such an arrangement of lands and seas, and that there have been,
if not always, at least from a very ancient period, emerged
lands occupying a considerable part of the northern hem
isphere, advancing very far toward the Pole, and describ ing around the Arctic Sea a belt of more or less contigu ous countries and islands. This is, in effect, what geol ogy teaches. The changes, immersions, and emersions
have never been anything but partial and successive, while the skeletons of the continents go back to the most remote ages. There have always been a Europe, an
Asia, an America, and Arctic lands. We know certainly that there have always been around the Arctic Pole ex
tensive territories, if not continents, long the home of the same plants as the rest of the globe, and that, beginning



HOW THE EARTH WAS PEOPLED. 445
with an epoch that corresponds with the end of the
Jurassic, the climate, at first as warm there as elsewhere, has tended gradually to become colder. The depression of temperature was at first manifested very slowly, and was far from having attained its present degree in the Tertiary ; for the trees that then grew in Greenland the
sequoias, magnolias, and plane-trees now attain their full development in Southern Europe, and are not suited
with the climate of Central Europe. We are, then, as sured of the ancient existence, near the Arctic Pole, of a zone of lands covered with a rich vegetation. The perma nent existence of a polar sea is none the less attested by
fossils from all parts of the region. The neighborhood
of the Pole was long habitable, and inhabited by man in a time near that in which the vestiges of his industry be gin to show themselves alike in Europe and America. In passing thus from the Arctic lands to those bordering
on the polar circle, and through the latter into Asia, Europe, and America, man would only have taken the road which a host of plants and animal followed, either before him or at the same time, and under the stress of the same circumstances.
It is, in fact, by the aid of migrations from the neigh
borhood of the Pole that we can generally explain the
phenomenon of scattered or disjoined species, a phenom
enon identical with the one which man of the Old World and man of the New World present when they are com pared. Combining present notions with the indications furnished by the fossils, we discover numerous examples of disjunction in which -allied forms, often hardly dis tinguishable, have been distributed at the same time in
scattered regions, at extremely remote points in the boreal hemisphere, without any apparent connection
along the parallels, to explain the common unit. Europe attests by undeniable fossils that it had formerly a host
of vegetable types and forms that are now American,



446 APPENDIX,
which it could have received only from the extreme North.
It had, for example, magnolias, tulip-trees, sassafras, maples, and poplars, comparable in all respects to those which grow in the United States. The two plane-trees, that of the West and that of Asia Minor, to which we may add an extinct fossil European plane-tree, illustrate the same phenomenon of dispersion. Europe in the Tertiary period witnessed the growth of a ginko similar to the one in the north of China. It had sequoias and a bald cypress corresponding with the trees of those names that are now growing in California and Louisiana. The beech seems to have been growing in the Arctic circumpolar zone before it was introduced and extended through out the northern hemisphere. The same is doubtless the case with the hemlock, of which distinguishable traces
have been found in Grinnell-land, above the eighty-sec ond degree of latitude, of a date much earlier than that of its introduction into Europe. The well-established presence in both continents of many animals peculiar to the northern hemisphere must be attributed to emigra tions, if not from the Pole, at least from countries con tiguous to the polar circle. This is obvious in the case
of the reindeer, bison, and stag; but it ought to be equally true in respect to animals of more ancient times, and although we have no other direct proofs of it than the abundance of the remains of mammoths in upper Si beria, the same law doubtless includes the elephants and
mastodons. We mean here the species of these two genera which were propagated from the North to the
South, and were, in America and Europe, the companions of primitive man. The connection of the continental masses with their belt of hardly discontinuous lands around the polar circle gives the key to all these phe
nomena. The cause on which they depend would be con
stantly producing radiations and consequently disjunc tions of species and races, whatever kingdom we may consider.



HOW THE EARTH WAS PEOPLED. 447
Before leaving the questions that touch on the pre sumed origin of man, we cannot refrain from speaking of the relations which it has been sought to establish be tween him and the pithecan apes. Primitive man, ac cording to some authors of the transformist school, was
an anthropomorphic ape, perfected physically as to his walk and erect attitude, intellectually by the development of his cranial capacity, till the moment when reasoning, or the faculty of abstraction and the power of using artic
ulate language, took in him the place of instinct. Nu merous and undeniable anatomical or physiological anal ogies of the human body and those of the more highly organized monkeys, which have no tails nor callosities on their paws, and whose faces and ways have something singularly human, favor this system, at least in appear
ance. The pithecans have, however, other contiguities than purely human ones. Their ways are rather analo gous than directly assimilable to those of man ; with other adaptations, they seem to have followed a wholly different course of evolution. They are essentially climb
ers, while man is exclusively a walker, and has always been predisposed to the erect position. The highest monkeys, the anthropomorphous apes, walk badly and
with difficulty. When they leave the trees in which they
live, their position is a stooping one, and they bend down their toes so as not to touch the ground with the soles of
their feet. We have, then, reason not to admit the simian origin of man without decisive proofs. Moreover, the pithecans seem to have been evolved in an inverse direc
tion from man. Rejoicing in the heat, they perish rapidly when brought into the temperate zones, and this is espe cially the case with the anthropoid apes. Thus, while man, coming from the North, advances toward the South
only when the depression of temperature favors his prog ress in that direction, the monkeys, to which a strong heat is a vital element, were developed in an age when



448 APPENDIX.
Europe had a sub-tropical climate, and disappeared from that continent as soon as the climate became temperate, so that their departure concides with the arrival of man.
They fled South to find the heat they needed, precisely
when the diminution of the heat opened to man the region from which it excluded his predecessors. The
necessity of placing the cradle of the pithecans in a hot country enables us to separate the monkeys of the East ern and Western continents into two distinct groups, marked by differences in dentition important enough to oblige us to assume an extreme antiquity for their sep aration. Both are descended from the lemurians, now
represented only in Madagascar, but of which early Ter tiary fossils are found in Europe. The most recent lemurians in Europe are found at the end of the Eocene. It is later, in the Miocene, and that not the lowest, that we meet pithecans similar to those of the equatorial zone of the Eastern continent. At this epoch, which was nearly that of Oeningen and the Mollassic Sea, which divided Europe from East to West, a subtropical climate
still prevailed in the centre of the continent, and the
palm-trees extended up into Bohemia, along the northern banks of the great interior sea. By favor of this tem
perature the monkeys occupied Europe to near the fortyfifth degree, but without going above it, to disappear for ever as soon as it became cool enough for men and
elephants. The Mesopithecus Penteliti, of which M. Gaudry has dis covered twenty-five individuals at Pikermi, was small, walked on its four paws, and lived on twigs and leaves.
The Dryopithecus of St. Gaudens had the characteristics of the highest anthropomorphs, with the bestial face of the gorilla ; but it is to this animal that M. Gaudry is in
clined to attribute the flints, intentionally chipped, ac cording to the Abbe Bourgeois, of the Beauce limestone, at Thenay in the St. Gaudens geognostic horizon. The



HOW THE EARTH WAS PEOPLED. 449
Pliopithecus of Sansan (Gers) resembles a gibbon. To
find the present analogues of the Pliopithecus and Dryo
pithecus of Miocene Europe, it is necessary to go across the tropic of Cancer to about 12 North latitude, or more than thirty degrees South of the locality of these fossils. If, as is probable, the same interval existed between the
perimeter frequented by the European anthropomorphs
and the natal region in which man was originally con fined, we shall find the latter in the latitude of Greenland, at 70 or 75. This is indeed an hypothetical calcula tion, but it is based on a double argument hard to refute.
We can reach almost the same conclusion by a little different reasoning. The abundance of large-flaked in
struments in the contiguous valleys of the Somme and the Seine marks the existence at that point of external con ditions evidently favorable to the diffusion of man, whose race was then multiplying for the first time. The flora of that epoch, as observed near Fontainebleau, indicates the presence of conditions similar to those now existing
in the south of France, near the forty-second degree of latitude. Now, to reach, starting from the forty-second
degree, the nearly tropical regions where palm, camphor, and southern laurel trees are associated together, we have to go twelve or fifteen degrees South, to the thirtieth or
twenty-eighth degree of latitude, where we see the same
climatological conditions existing as prevailed in Miocene Europe when it was hardly warm enough for the anthro pomorphic apes. Between these conditions and those which seem to have been first favorable to the growth of
the human race there existed a space of twelve or fifteen
degrees of latitude. But when palm-trees were growing near Prague, and camphor-trees grew as far North as Dantzic, man, if he existed then, might have lived with out inconvenience beyond or around the Arctic Circle, within equal reach of North America and Europe, which he was destined to people.

SECTION III. THE RECEPTION ACCORDED TO &quot;THE
TRUE KEY.&quot;
As indicated in the text, the view of Ancient Cosmol
ogy presented in chapter first of Part fourth is entirely at variance with that of all our standard authorities. Pro
fessor Packard, of Yale College, remarks, &quot;If it is true, all our books and maps are wrong, and we must admit that all scholars have been mistaken in their understand
ing of the ancient records.&quot; In like manner, one of the
foreign periodicals editorially observes, &quot; If it is correct, a most striking proof is given of the possibility of many successive generations of archaeologists, scientists, and scholars failing to catch the entire drift and spirit of an cient legends and literature in their cosmic teachings and relations.&quot; Under these circumstances the ordinary reader seems entitled to some further information before being asked to give it his adherence.
The new view, then, was first published in the columns
of &quot;The Independent,&quot; New York, August 25, 1881. In March of the following year a second and enlarged edi
tion appeared in &quot; The Boston University Year Book,&quot; vol. ix. Soon after a third edition was issued as a pam phlet by Messrs. Ginn and Heath, of Boston. In each case it was entitled &quot; The True Key to Ancient Cosmol
ogy and Mythical Geography,&quot; and was illustrated by the diagram which stands as frontispiece to this work. Copies of the paper in each of its successive editions
were promptly forwarded usually with a brief personal note to the most competent scholars in the universities
of Athens, Rome, Berlin, Leipsic, Heidelberg, Bonn, Leyden, London, Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Bel fast, and Dublin. As might be expected an interesting and varied correspondence ensued. Of many of the let ters the writer does not feel that he has the right to



RECEPTION OF TRUE KEY. 451
make any public use ; but in printing the following ex tracts he believes that he violates no proprieties.
A. H. Sayce, of the University of Oxford, one of the most distinguished of living professors of Comparative Philology, after reading a preliminary sketch, wrote to the author as follows :
Provisionally, I may say that your view seems to me emi nently reasonable and likely to clear up several difficulties.
Certainly it throws light on the voyage of Odysseus, more particularly on the visit to Hades. I look forward to the appearance of your book, which will be of great value to students of the past.
In more recent communications Professor Sayce has
used still stronger expressions of personal acquiescence. The following are all from letters written before the publication of &quot; Homer s Abode of the Dead.&quot;
Right Hon. William E. Gladstone, author of &quot;Ho
meric Studies,&quot; &quot;Juventus Mundi,&quot; &quot;Homeric Synchro
nism,&quot; etc. :
I have received with much interest and pleasure the com munications you have been good enough to address to me on
the Homeric Cosmology. Very long ago I became convinced
that Homer proceeded, not on the idea commonly assigned to
him, of the earth as a plane, but on the conception of a spher
ical or convex surface. My views have long been set forth :
fundamentally, I am at one with you, and when (if ever) my
time of leisure shall arrive, I shall try to learn whether, in the points where you differ from or go beyond me, you have not
been the more thorough and accurate of the two.
Robert K. Douglas, of the British Museum, and Pro fessor of Chinese in King s College, London :
I read your Key with great interest ; and, without having
made any special study of the subject, I must say that to my
mind it explains most satisfactorily the Homeric Cosmology.
Richard Dacre Archer-Hind, Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, England :



452 APPENDIX.
I must say that your explanation of ancient cosmology
seems to me very simple and natural. It certainly throws a flood of light upon several points which were before very ob
scure. I am glad to hear that it is approved by so distin
guished an Orientalist as Dr. Rost, Librarian of the India Of fice, London.
C. P. Tiele, D. D., Professor of the History of Relig ions in the University of Leyden, Holland :
After perusing your paper a second time, I cannot but ex press my opinion that your hypothesis is very plausible and
ingenious. The conception of the world as a sphere is not so young as is generally thought. ... I think you are right in identifying the wide Olympus with the highest heaven. . . .
Your description agrees very well with the ancient cosmogra
phy of the Babylonians. With you I am satisfied that there
is no real difference between mythical Olympus and heaven,
and that all earthly Olymps (as there are several of them) are only localizations of the same heavenly abode of the gods.
Howard Crosby, D. D., LL. D., ex-Chancellor of the
University of New York :
Your Key to Ancient Cosmology is to me most satisfactory.
I believe you have made a valuable discovery.
W. D. Whitney, LL. D., Professor of Sanskrit and Com
parative Philology, Yale College :
I have looked with some care through your exposition of your view respecting the ancient conceptions of the cosmos, and find it very ingenious and suggestive, and worthy of care ful comparison with the expressions of ancient authors on the
subject.
Dr. Charles R. Lanman, Professor of Sanskrit, Har
vard University :
The Key I have read once more, and think it is very simple,
ingenious and adequate for the explanation of a great variety of heretofore perplexing allusions.
W. S. Tyler, D. D., LL. D., Professor of the Greek
Language and Literature, Amherst College :



RECEPTION OF TRUE KEY. 453
Permit me to thank you for the paper. Perhaps no one key will unlock all the chambers of the labyrinth of ancient cos
mology and mythical geography. But I believe yours comes the nearest to it of any that has yet been found.
William A. Packard, Professor of the Latin Language
and Literature, College of New Jersey, Princeton :
Dr. Warren s pamphlet gives the result of ingenious and able research, which claims very careful consideration. It does seem to act very widely as a solvent in interpreting an cient cosmogonies. Its elucidation of Homeric expressions is
very striking.
Stephen D. Peet, Editor of &quot; American Antiquarian and Oriental Journal :
&quot;
I believe that you have struck a very rich field in your pam
phlet on the ancient cosmology. I have long surmised that there was something back of the astrology of the ancients which had exerted a great influence on the religious concep
tions, and even on the literary and speculative thoughts of the ancients, but have to thank you for putting together the facts so as to discover the key.
J. Henry Thayer, D. D., late Professor of Greek and
N. T. Interpretation, Andover Theological Seminary, now Professor of the same in Harvard University Divin ity School :
Allow me to express my great interest in your Key to An cient Cosmology. It gives one a sense of relief amounting to satisfaction at its very first perusal. I shall take great in
terest in teaching it.
James Freeman Clarke, D. D., author of &quot;Ten Great
Religions,&quot; etc. :
It seems to me to throw much light on many passages in
the classic writers. ... I cannot help thinking that your view will be a key to unlock many obscure passages.
The seven following extracts fairly illustrate the mass of the communications received since the publication of

advance of the present volume simply as a further illus tration of the correctness and utility of &quot;The True Key.&quot;
Each is from the pen of a European scholar of first rank, and the last of them from one of the most widely known
of German Egyptologists. Not having as yet permission to use the names of the writers, they are here withheld.
I thank you very much for sending me the &quot; Boston Univer
sity Year Book,&quot; containing your interesting article on the Underworld of Homer.
Homeric interpretation long and (I think) absurdly placed
the way to the Underworld in the West ; but I am glad at
least to acknowledge that from the West that is, from you
and your country much light has been thrown upon the Un derworld of Homer. In 1868 I went a long way, in a work then published, to wards the doctrine that the entrance to the Underworld was beneath the solid earth-mass, as, in 1858, I had endeavored to destroy the prevailing notion about the road by the West.
I regard with amazement the mass of false interpretations
of Homer which a quarter of a century ago I found prevail
ing, and of which I think we are gradually getting rid.
One very great source of aid has been the opening up of
Egyptian and Assyrian knowledge, and from this quarter I
believe that more aid will yet be drawn. With you I think that the supposed inconsistencies of
Homer about the Underworld are really ascribable wholly, or in the main, to his interpreters.
Many thanks for your letter and for the interesting paper in
the &quot; Boston University Year Book &quot; which has followed it.
The illustration of your theory which is furnished by the Voy
age of the Egyptian Sindbad is very striking, and must be most gratifying to you. I can find no objection to your view except those suggested by the original meaning of the words
Amenti and Erebos (Assyrian eribu = ^erebh) ; and I am therefore inclined to subscribe to all that Professor Tiele has written you in regard to it. That in Homer the earth is sup posed to be a sphere, with Olympos above and Tartaros below, clears up every difficulty.



RECEPTION OF TRUE KEY. 455
I read your paper with great interest and pleasure. Now again you have put your favorite thesis so clearly and forcibly
that I incline more and more to your opinion. I only wait, before surrendering, for some leisure to go accurately over the principal facts and citations.
I have read your paper with great interest. Your ex
planation makes things clear, at any rate, though I must read the Odyssey again before venturing to affirm that you see
things as Homer saw them.
Accept my best thanks for your &quot;Year Book&quot; for 1883,
with its excellent and interesting dissertation upon &quot; Homer s
Abode of the Dead.&quot; Not being a Homerologist, I am hardly
entitled to express an opinion, but your argument seems to me conclusive. Your paper has an especial interest for me, inasmuch as it shows that there was less difference between the cosmography
of Homer and the cosmographies of his successors than we
had been brought to suppose. (The modest writer of the fore going is one of the most eminent Hellenists of Cambridge, Eng.}
I have to thank you for your new contribution to our knowledge with reference to the conceptions of the ancients as to the shape of the earth. Your paper on the &quot; Navel of the Earth &quot; is full of interesting and important information. My only doubt is whether the time has come for such wide generalizations as you propose. However, our science wants centrifugal as well as centripetal forces, and a discoverer must not be afraid of places marked &quot;

thank you for your work. It seems to me that your theory meets the test of all theories, that of accounting for the facts that cannot otherwise be reconciled. Besides thus reconcil ing the statements of ancient authors regarding the world and
the underworld, your theory enables us to see in their writings
many new and fruitful suggestions regarding matters hitherto unnoticed and unsuspected. Trusting that this treatise may receive the attention and currency which it so eminently de
serves, I remain, etc., etc.
Rev. A. B. Hyde, D. D., Professor of Greek in Alle

Homer has been so long waiting, not for an observer, but for some one to teach us how to observe, a seer to show us how to see. The more I reflect upon your scheme of his cosmol

is, its harmony with the Homeric utterances.
The following does not exactly belong in this place, but, coming from an inspired prophet of God, it seems entitled to a somewhat exceptional treatment.

His au thoritative announcement of the early restoration at the North Pole of the &quot; curseless &quot;

any of our converts, meditating upon the lost Eden, may
chance to fall :

SECTION IV. THE EARTH AND WORLD OF THE HINDUS.
(Illustrating pp. 129-733 ; 148-154; 183, etc.)
THAT the mythological cosmos of the modern Hindus was originally constructed upon the basis of a geocentric system of the planetary heavens I cannot doubt. Its &quot; concentric oceans &quot; are simply the interplanetary spaces
mythologically pictured and described. Its &quot;concentric continents &quot; are those invisible solid, concentric, &quot;
crys talline spheres
&quot; which revolved about the common axis
of the Pythagoreo-Ptolemaic universe, and were presided over by the different visible planets. In both systems the Earth is not only the centre of the planetary revo
lution, but also the centre of each planetary sphere itself.
How entirely incorrect the flat-world interpretation or
dinarily given us is 1 could hardly be more forcibly shown than it is in the following extract :
&quot;
Priya Vrata, by the wheel of whose car the Earth [or better, the World] was divided into seven continents, had thirteen male chil dren. Six of these embraced an ascetic life ; the rest ruled the seven divisions of the Earth [World.] To Ag
nidhra was assigned the Jambu-dwipa [the Earth] ; to Medhatithi, Plaksha; to Vapushmat, Salmali ; to Jyotishmat, Kusa ; to Dyutimat, Krauncha ; to Bhavya, Saka ; and to Savala, Pushkara. With the exception of the sovereign of Jambu each of the six other kings is said to
have had seven sons, among whom he divided his king
dom into seven equal parts. These seven divisions in each of the six continents are separated by seven chains of mountains and seven rivers lying breadthwise, and placed with such inclinations with respect to one another that if a straight line be drawn through any chain of mountains or

rivers and its corresponding mountains or rivers on the other
continents, and produced toward the central island, it would meet the centre of the Earth. 1 l All Puranic descriptions of the Earth are by no means consistent with each other, but the following from the Vishnu Purana can readily be understood if read in the light of the illustrative cuts already given : Parasara. You shall hear from me, Maitreya, a brief
account of the earth. A full detail I could not give you
in a century. The seven great insular continents are Jambu, Plaksha,
Salmali, Kusa, Krauncha, Saka, and Pushkara ; and they are surrounded, severally, by seven great seas, the sea of saltwater (Lavana), of sugar-cane juice (Ikshu), of wine (Sura), of clarified butter (Sarpis), of curds (Dadhi), of milk (Dugdha), and of fresh water (Jala).
Jambu-dwipa is in the centre of all these. And in the centre of this (continent) is the golden mountain Meru.
The height of Meru is eighty-four thousand Yojanas ; and its depth below (the surface of the earth) is sixteen
(thousand). Its diameter at the summit is thirty-two (thousand Yojanas), and at its base sixteen thousand ; so that this mountain is like the seed-cup of the lotos of the earth.
The boundary mountains (of the earth) are Himavat, Hemakiita, and Nishadha, which lie south (of Meru) ;
and Nila, weta, and Sringin ; which are situated to the north (of it). The two central ranges (those next to Meru, or Nishadha and Nila) extend for a hundred thou sand (Yojanas, running east and west). Each of the oth ers diminishes ten thousand (Yojanas, as it lies more
remote from the centre). 2 They are two thousand (Yo

janas) in height, and as many in breadth. The Varshas (or countries between these ranges) are : Bharata (India), south of the Himavat mountains ; next, Kimpurusha, between Himavat and Hemakiica ; north of the latter, and south of Nishadha, is Harivarsha : north of Meru is Ramyaka, extending from the Nila or blue mountains to the Sweta (or white) mountains ; Hiranmaya lies between the Sweta and Sringin ranges ; and Uttarakuru is beyond the latter, following the same direction as Bharata. Each of these is nine thousand (Yojanas) in extent. Ilavrita is of similar dimensions, but in the centre of it is the golden mountain Meru ; and the country extends nine thousand (Yojanas) in each direction from the four sides of the mountain. There are four mountains in this Varsha, formed as buttresses to Meru, each ten thou sand Yojanas in elevation. That on the east is called Mandara ; that on the south, Gandhamadana ; that on
the west, Vipula ; and that on the north, Suparswa. On each of these stands severally a Kadamba-tree, a Jambutree, a Pippala, and a Vata ; each spreading over eleven hundred (Yojanas, and towering aloft like) banners on the mountains. From the Jambu-tree the insular con
tinent Jambu-dwipa derives its appellation. The apples
Max Miiller in a modern Sanskrit tractate, whose author s name I
regret to have lost, all the ranges were represented as parallel with the Nila and Nishadha. Moreover, as the whole surface of Jambu-dwipa was represented as a circular flat disk, the second of the
two successive outer ranges was much more than the required one tenth shorter than its predecessor. Besides this, Jambu-dwipa is re peatedly described in this same Purana as a globe, and should be so
treated in all graphic representations. Postscript. Since the above was written a long search for Capt. Wilford s diagrams in vol. viii. of the Asiatic Researches (London, 1808) has been crowned with success. His perpetual vacillation between what he considers the primitive and proper flat earth of &quot; the Pauranics &quot; and the spherical earth of the astronomers is the chief source
of his manifold embarrassments. A second and subordinate source of endless trouble is his effort to interpret mythical geography in the terms of geography actual.

of that tree are as large as elephants. When they are
rotten they fall upon the crest of the mountain ; and
from their expressed juice is formed the Jambu river, the
waters of which are drunk by the inhabitants; and, in
consequence of drinking of that stream, they pass their
days in content and health, being subject neither to per spiration, to foul odors, to decrepitude, nor organic decay.
The soil on the banks of the river, absorbing the Jambu
juice, and being dried by gentle breezes, becomes the gold termed Jambunada (of which) the ornaments of the
Siddhas (are fabricated). The country of Bhadraswa
lies on the east of Meru, and Ketumala, on the west;
and between these two is the region Ilavrita. On the east (of the same) is the forest Chaitraratha ; the Gandhamadana (wood) is on the south ; (the forest of) Vai
bhiaja is on the west ; and (the grove of India, or) Man
dana is on the north. There are also four great lakes, the waters of which are partaken of by the gods, called Arudoda, Mahabhadra, Asitoda, and Manasa.
The principal mountain ridges which project from the base of Meru, like filaments from the root of the lotos,
are, on the east, Sitanta, Mukunda, Kurari, Malyavat,
and Vaikanka ; on the south, Trikiita, Sisira, Patanga, Ruchaka, and Nishadha; on the west ikhivasas, Vaidurya, Kapila, Gandhamadana, and Jarudhi ; and on the north Sankhakuta, &ishabha, Hamsa. Naga, and Kalanjara. These and others extend from between the inter vals in the body, or from the heart, of Meru.
On the summit of Meru is the vast city of Brahma, extending fourteen thousand leagues, and renowned in heaven ; and around it, in the cardinal points and the intermediate quarters, are situated the stately cities of Indra and the other regents of the spheres. The capital of Brahma is inclosed by the river Ganges, which, issu ing from the foot of Vishnu, and washing the lunar orb,
falls, here, from the skies, and after encircling the city

divides into four mighty rivers flowing in opposite direc tions. These rivers are the 3ita, the Alakananda, the Chakshu, and the Bhadra. The first, falling upon the tops of the inferior mountains, on the east side of Meru,
flows over their crests, and passes through the country of BhadrasVa, to the ocean. The Alakananda flows south,
to (the country of) Bharata, and, dividing into seven rivers on the way, falls into the sea. The Chakshu falls into the sea, after traversing all the western mountains
and passing through the country of Ketumala. And the Bhadra washes the country of the Uttarakurus, and emp ties itself into the northern ocean. Meru, then, is confined between the mountains Nfla and Nishadha (on the north and south), and between Malyavat and Gandhamadana (on the west and east). It lies between them, like the pericarp of a lotos. The countries of Bharata, Ketumala, Bhadraswa, and Uttarakuru lie, like leaves of the lotos of the world, ex terior to the boundary mountains. Jathara and Devakiita are two mountain ranges, running north and south, and connecting the two chains of Nfla and Nishadha. Gandhamadana and Kailasa extend, east and west, eighty Yojanas in breadth, from sea to sea. Nishadha and Pariyatra are the limitative mountains on the west, stretch ing, like those on the east, between the Nfla and Nis hadha ranges. And the mountains Trisfinga and Jarudha are the northern limits (of Meru), extending, east and west, between the two seas. Thus I have repeated to you the mountains described by great sages as the
boundary mountains, situated in pairs on each of the four sides of Meru. Those also which have been mentioned as the fila ment mountains (or spurs), 3itanta and the rest, are ex
ceedingly delightful. The valleys embosomed amongst them are favorite resorts of the Siddhas and Charanas. And there are situated upon them agreeable forests and

pleasant cities, embellished with the palaces of Lakshmi,
Vishriu, Agni, Siirya, and other deities, and peopled by celestial spirits ; whilst the Yakshas, Rakshasas, Daityas} and Danavas pursue their pastimes in the vales.
These, in short, are the regions of Paradise, or Swarga, the seats of the righteous, and where the wicked do not arrive even after a hundred births. In (the country of)
Bhadraswa, Vishriu resides as Hayasiras (the horse headed) ; in Ketumala, as Varaha (the boar) in Bharata, as the tortoise (Kurma) ; in Keru, as the fish
(Matsya) ; in his universal form, everywhere : for Hari
pervades all places. He is the supporter of all things ; he is all things. In the eight realms of Kimpurusha
and the rest (or all exclusive of Bharata), there is no
sorrow, nor weariness, nor anxiety, nor hunger, nor ap prehension j their inhabitants are exempt from all in
firmity and pain, and live (in uninterrupted enjoyment) for ten or twelve thousand years. Indra never sends rain upon them ; for the earth abounds with water. In those places there is no distinction of Kfita, Treta, or any succession of ages. In each of these Varshas there
are, respectively, seven principal ranges of mountains,
from which, O best of Brahmans, hundreds of rivers take their rise. (From H. H. Wilson s Translation of the Vish

&quot; MIT diesem Namen Skambha der so viel als
Pfeiler, Saule, bedeutet, verbindet sich die Vorstellung
eines den Himmel oder die Welt tragenden Korpers. Diese Vorstellung hat innerhalb des Veda eine allmahlische Ausbildung erfahren. In Rigveda ist der Skambha
urspriinglich als eigentliche Saule, als holzerner Pfeiler gedacht und ist so im Grund nur ein concreter Ausdruck
fiir des Himmels Veste (vgl. IV., 13, 5 ; VIII., 41, TO). Es findet sich aber schon daneben die lebendigere Auffas
sung, dass derselbe ein Pflanzenstengel ist, wobei der Mythus an die Somapflanze denkt. Hierbei erscheint
der Skambha als mit Saft gefiillt (apurna aih$u, vgl. IX., 74, 2 ; 86, 46), und es ist damit ein Bild des Himmels
gewonnen, das das doppelte Moment des Festen (Auf
rechten) und Fliissigen gliicklich in sich vereinigt. Diese Anschauung tritt nun viel entwickelter im Atharvaveda
wieder auf. Hier ist der Skambha zunachst als der Eine
Grundpfeiler und Tragbalken des Weltgebaudes geschildert in den alle einzelnen Theile desselben eingelassen
sind, und der das gesammte Queergebalke durchzieht (avi$, pravif). Himmel. Luft und Erde mit all ihren Korpern und Elementen, mit dern ganzen Kreislauf ihrer Phanomene und Katastrophen, alles ruht auf dieser
Unterlage, vom Pragapati darauf gegriindet (X., 7, 7, 2 ff., 35). Auch die Gesammtheit der Gotter wird von dieser Weltsaule getragen (X., 7, 13). An diese architektonische Auffassung reiht sich auch im Ath. Veda die Vorstellung eines Baumes, von dessen Aesten die Rede ist, dessen Aesten die Gotter selbst sind (vgl. X., 7, 21, 22, 38), und der einen Schatz bergen soil. Selbst in animalischer Form

wird der Skambha dargestellt, so dass seine einzelnen
Korpertheile unterschieden werden (X., 18, 19, 33, 34). Ja schliesslich geht der Mythus so weit, dass er diesen Weltpfeiler oder Weltbaum nicht bloss beseelt denkt, son
dern geradezu mit der Weltseele (Purusha) mit dem obers
ten Brahman, mit dem Praga pati (dem Weltschopfer) identificirt (X., 7, 15, 17, 8, 2), und die hierin enthaltene
Personification tritt noch entschiedener zu Tag, wenn der Skambha sogar mit Indra zusammenfallt (X., 7, 29, 30).
Mit Recht ist der elementare Skambha mit dem Atlas der Griechen und den Saulen des Herakles verglichen worden. Wie aber M. Miiller angesichts des Skambha und
der oben vorgefiihrten Zeugnisse die Behauptung aufstellen kann :
&quot; Es ist kein Beleg dafiir vorhanden, dass ir
gend etwas der Auffassung der Yggdrasil ahnliches je den
vedischen Dichtern in den Sinn, kam &quot;
(Essays, Deutsch, II., 184 [Chips, vol. ii., 204]), ist mir unverstandlich.
Vergleiche auch die Behandlung des Skambhamythus bei de Gubernatis Mithologia Vedica, pp. 273-299. Aus der spateren Entwicklung der indischen Mythologie nenne ich noch besonders die Darstellung des Weltbaumes oder himmlischen Baumes in dem paradiesischen,
bei der Quirlung des Oceans entstandenen, Parigata (Korallenbaum, Erythrina Indica), der durch Krishna auf Wunsch seiner Gattin Satjabhama Indra entrissen wurde.
Die Beschreibung des Baumes, sowie seiner Entfiihrung erscheint im Purina (Vishnu, Bhagavata) noch einfach
(vgl. Vish. P. bei H. H. Wilson, pp. 585-588), sehr ausfiihrlich dagegen und mit einzelnen Abweichungen im
Harivaific.a. Er hat nach diesem die Eigenschaft, &quot;de satisfaire tous les de sirs. Vous n aurez qu a penser, et aussitot par la vertu de celle fleur, qui saura s entendre et

So herrscht gleich uber den Ort wo die Unterwelt zu denken set ein merkwurdiger Zvuiespalt. PRELLER.
Bei Homer ist eine doppelte A nsicht von der Lage des Todtenreiches zu erken* nen, einma-l unter der Erde, und dann iviederum auf der Oberfliiche des Bodens
in dem ewigeti Dunkel jenseits des ivestlichen Ocean. Die A nsichten voti den beiden Hades fliessen bestandig durcheinander. So weit aber die mil jedem verbundenen Vorstellungen zu sondern und einzeln aufzufassen moglich ist, mussen ivir sie darzulegen im Folgenden versuchen. VOLCKER.
WHERE does Homer locate the realm of Hades ? In the whole broad field of Homeric scholarship it
would be difficult to find a more fascinating question. Few have been more written upon. The literature of the
subject is itself almost a library. No mythologist, no commentator upon the poet, no class-room interpreter
even, can evade the question ; and yet, in their answers, the Homeric authorities of all modern times, whatever
their nationality, present only a pitiable spectacle of help less bewilderment. Classifying these various interpreters
according to the answers they respectively give to the question propounded, they stand as follows : First, a class who content themselves with the general assertion that the earth of Homer was a &quot; flat disk,&quot; and that his Hades, like that of the ancients generally, was undoubtedly conceived of as a dark recess or cavern in the bosom of this earth-disk. Anything in the Odyssey
1 Printed in advance in The Boston University Year Book, vol. x.



468 APPENDIX.
or elsewhere inconsistent with this view is simply a play
of poetic fancy. Second, a class if class it be who say with the genial Wilhelm Jordan, &quot; Das Hadesreich der Odyssee
ist die von der Sonne abgekehrte Riickseite der Erd
scheibe, die wriyQov, Gegenerde, eines weit spateren Zeit
alters. Von der ei8w/)os apovpa und vom Gotterhimmel
aus betrachtet bleibt es allerdings Unterwelt, wro KtvOeo-L
ycuas, aber nicht als Erdinneres, sondern als jenseitige Oberflache.&quot; 1 Here the earth is still a flat disk ; but Hades, instead of being within it, is simply its under or reverse side.
Third, a class who locate the shadowy realm on the
same plane with the inhabited earth, but in the far West, just inside the Ocean-stream. This includes all commen tators who, locating Hades above ground in the West, place Kirke s isle in the same quarter, and hold that Odysseus did not cross over the Ocean-stream. Fourth, a class who locate it in the far West, just out side the Ocean-stream. This includes all commentators
who, locating Hades above ground in the West, place Kirke s isle in the same quarter, but hold that Odysseus crossed the Ocean-stream. 2
1 Fleckeisen s Jahrbiicher, 1872, vol. cv., pp. 1-8. 2 Rinck, Die Religion der Hellenen, Th. ii., p. 459 :
&quot; Bei Homer ist das Schattenreich noch keine Unterwelt, sondern jenes liegt ausser dem von der Sonne beschienenen Bereich der Erde, jenseits des Okeanos.&quot; Here, and in some other writers, along with a retention of the unity of the authorship of the Iliad and Odyssey, we find an
intimation that the perplexing discrepancy in Greek representations
of Hades is due to a gradual translocation of it from the far West to the interior of the earth, in consequence of advancing geograph ical knowledge. Perhaps a separate class should have been intro
duced, consisting of the representatives of this view. But had this been done, yet a fourteenth class would have been necessary to in clude those who, with Charles Francis Keary, exactly reverse the process, and make the oldest Greek Hades interterranean, and the trans-oceanic one at the West a later product. The Mythology of the Eddas. London, 1882 : p. 14.



HOMERS ABODE OF THE DEAD. 469
Fifth, a class who locate it in the far East, just inside the Ocean-stream. This class includes all who place Kirke s isle in the East, and hold that Odysseus did not cross the Ocean-stream in visiting the superterranean Hades. Sixth, a class who locate it in the far East, just outside the Ocean-stream. This includes all who place Kirke s isle in the East, and hold that Odysseus crossed the Ocean
stream in visiting the superterranean Hades. Seventh, a class who try to harmonize the conflicting
representations by making the one set of expressions re late to a Hades in the bosom of the flat earth, and the other set of expressions relate to &quot; the entrance &quot; of the passage leading down to it from the world of living men. This class is again subdivided into four sub- classes, ac cording as they maintain a as-oceanic or trans-oceanic loca tion of this mouth of Hades, and place it to the East or to the West of the poet. Eighth, a class who hold that the difficulty is in the
poet himself, he having got two incompatible mythologies mixed up together. Ninth, a class who try to solve all discrepancies by as signing the different representations in the two poems, and in different parts of the same poem, to different ages and to different authors. Tenth, a class who query whether or no it be not ad missible to hold that Homer had two realms of Hades,
the one &quot;
subterranean,&quot; and the other &quot; beyond the
Ocean.&quot;
Eleventh, a class who, with Altenburg and Gerland, re solve the whole story of Odysseus descent to Hades into an astronomical myth ;
l or with Cox see in it simply a
mythologico-poetic expression for the prosaic fact that the Sun, the &quot; lord of day,&quot; returning after his morn

ing and noontide wanderings to his western home, some times finds it necessary to make his way behind dark clouds. 1
Twelfth, a class who point out the manifest difficulties
of the problem, but frankly profess their utter inability to present a solution. Of the more important of the maps of &quot; the world ac
cording to Homer,&quot; those of Bunbury, Volcker, and Forbiger are constructed according to the view of class fourth ; that of Ukert, according to the view of that di vision of class seventh who locate the Hades portal in the far West, just inside the Ocean-stream ; that of Glad stone, 2 according to the view of that division of class seventh who locate the Hades portal in the far East, just
inside the Ocean-stream. Volcker, however, is inclined to believe in two Homeric Hades-realms, the one in
terterranean, the other at the West superterranean and trans-oceanic.
Such are the multifarious, contradictory, confused, and
despairing answers given to our question by the most learned and eminent of Homeric scholars. It would be an easy task to fill a volume with citations illustrating
these various positions, and the ingenious but mutually destructive arguments by which their respective advo cates have sought to establish them. It will be more profitable to turn from such a Babel of ideas, over which the darkness of Hades itself seems to have fallen, and inquire what the poet himself has to say on the subject. The region of the dead is represented in Homer as one of perpetual night. Its name is Erebos. 8 From the
1 Mythology of the Aryan Nations, vol. ii., 171-180. 2 Mr. Gladstone has more recently abandoned the flat-earth theory, and tentatively advocated an interterranean Hades with its mouth
downwards. See his Primer, London and New York, 1878, pp. 5457 ; and Homeric Synchronism, London, 1876, p. 231. Perhaps this view also should have been included in the foregoing classification.

name of the divinity presiding in it, it is generally called the house or abode of Aides (Hades). 1 That it was con ceived of as underneath the earth appears from the per
petually recurring expressions, both in the Iliad and in the Odyssey, relating the descent into and ascent out
of it. 2 In certain passages it is in fact expressly spoken
of as &quot;under the earth ;
&quot; 3 in others, as &quot;under the re
cesses of the earth.&quot; 4 Hence Aides himself is styled
Zeus Kara;(#6Vio9,
&quot; the Subterranean Zeus.&quot; 5
In the Battle of the Gods there is a vivid picture of this
underworld and of its trembling king :
riques. Paris, 1876 : p. 13. The Shemitic origin of this term is sig nificant. It prepares us to find an agreement between the Homeric and the Assyrio-Babylonian ideas of the realm of the dead. Mr. Gladstone says,
&quot; Long before ... I had been struck by the pre dominance of a foreign character and associations in the Homeric Underworld of the eleventh Odyssey.&quot; Homeric Synchronism. Lon
don, 1876: p. 213. On the remarkably expressive cuneiform ideo graph for eribu, see the explanation given by Robert Brown, Jun., in the Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, May 4, 1880. 1 This term is also believed to be of Oriental origin, exactly corre sponding to the Bit Edi of the Akkadians. See the translations of The Descent of Istar. &quot; Talbot regards, and I think justly, the usual
etymology of Hades quasi Aides, invisible as an afterthought.&quot; Robert Brown, Jun., The Myth of KirkZ, p. 1 1 1 n. 2 Iliad, vi. 284; vii. 330; xiv. 457; xxii. 425. Odyssey, x. 174,

But see Mr. Gladstone s Homeric Synchronism, p. 222 :

Thus the blessed gods inciting, both sides engaged, and
among them made severe contention to break out. But dread
fully from above thundered the Father of gods and men, while beneath Poseidon shook the boundless earth and the lofty summits of the mountains. The roots and all the summits
of many-rilled Ida were shaken, and the city of the Trojans
and the ships of the Greeks. Aides himself, king of the nether world, trembled beneath, and leaped up from his throne
terrified, and shouted aloud, lest earth-shaking Poseidon should cleave asunder the earth over him, and disclose to mortals and
immortals his mansions, terrible, squalid, which even the gods loathe. 1
But while the abode of Aides is thus clearly represented
as under the earth, it is nevertheless represented as just
across the Ocean-river, and capable of being reached by ship. In the eleventh and twelfth books of the Odyssey, the voyage of Odysseus to this region is described in the
same apparently literal nautical terms as is the voyage to
the Land of the Lotus-Eaters. And of his interview with
the dead, Hayman says,
&quot; The whole scene is conceived by the poet as enacted on a geographical extension of the
earth beyond the Ocean-stream.&quot; 2 There is no hint of any descent into the interior of the earth, no passage through or into subterranean caverns. The journey is as natural in all its aspects as any voyage from one coast of the Atlantic to its opposite.8 Thus opens the eleventh book :
1 Iliad, xx. 61 ff. That there may be no question as to the impar tiality of the translations given in this paper, the well-known and widely circulated version by Theodore Alois Buckley, of Christ
Church, Oxford, is followed. A version giving more accurately the force of the verbs expressing upward and downward motion would in many passages be more favorable to the cosmological view here
presented. 2 Henry Hayman, D. D., The Odyssey of Homer. London, 1866:

HOMER S ABODE OF THE DEAD. 4/3
But when we were come down to the ship and the sea, we first of all drew the ship into the divine sea, and we placed a
mast and sails in the black ship. And taking the sheep we put them on board, and we ourselves also embarked grieving,
shedding the warm tear. And fair-haired Kirke (Circe) an
awful goddess, possessing human speech sent behind our dark-blue-prowed ship a moist wind that filled the sails, an ex
cellent companion. And we sat down, making use of each of the instruments in the ship, and the wind and the pilot directed it. And the sails of it passing over the sea were stretched out the whole day ; and the sun set, and all the ways were
overshadowed. And it reached the extreme boundaries of the
deep-flowing Ocean, 1 where are the people and city of the Kimmerians covered with shadow and vapor, nor does the shining sun behold them with his beams, neither when he goes toward the starry heaven, nor when he turns back again
from heaven to earth, but pernicious night is spread over hap less mortals. Having come there we drew up our ship, and
we took out the sheep, and we ourselves went again to the stream of the Ocean, until we came to the place which Kirke mentioned.
Here the hero performed the rites and held the consul tation which Kirke had previously prescribed in these terms :
&quot; O noble son of Laertes, much-contriving Odysseus, do not remain any longer in my house against your will. But first
you must perform another voyage, and come to the house of
A ides and awful Persephone, to consult the soul of Theban
Tiresias, a blind prophet, whose mind is firm. To him, even when dead, Persephone has given understanding, alone to be
prudent, but the rest flit about as shades.&quot;
&quot; Who, O Kirke, will conduct me on this voyage ? No one has yet come to Aides in a black ship.&quot;
&quot; O noble son of Laertes, much-contriving Odysseus, let not the desire of a guide for thy ship be at all a care to thee ; but having erected the mast, and spread out the white sails, sit
down, and let the blast of the North wind carry it. But when thou shalt have passed through the Ocean in thy ship, where
i That is, the farther shore. See Volcker, p. 145.



474 APPENDIX.
is the easy-dug 1 shore and the groves of Persephone, and tall poplars, and fruit-destroying willows, there draw up thy ship in the deep-eddying Ocean, and do thou thyself go to the spa cious house of Aides. Here indeed both Pyriphlegethon and Cocytus, which is a stream from the water of Styx, flow into Acheron ; and there is a rock, and the meeting of two loud
sounding rivers. There then, O hero, approaching near as I
command thee, dig a trench the width of a cubit each way;
and pour around it libations to all the dead, first with mixed honey, then with sweet wine, and again the third time with
water, and sprinkle white meal over it. And entreat much the powerless heads of the dead, promising that when thou comest to Ithaca thou wilt offer up in thy palace a barren heifer, which soever is the best, and wilt fill the pyre with excellent things, and that thou wilt sacrifice to Tiresias alone a black sheep, all black, which excels among thy sheep. But when thou shalt have entreated the illustrious nations of the dead with prayers, then sacrifice a male sheep and a black female, turning to ward Erebos ; and do thou thyself be turned away at a dis tance, going toward the streams of the river ; but there many
souls of those gone dead will come. Then immediately exhort
thy companions and command them, having skinned the sheep which lie there slain with the unpitying brass, to burn them and to invoke the gods, both mighty Aides and dread Per
sephone. And do thou, having drawn thy sharp sword from thy thigh, sit down, nor suffer the powerless heads of the dead to go near the blood before thou inquirest of Tiresias.
Then the prophet will immediately come to thee, O leader of the people, who will tell to thee the voyage and the meas
ures of the way and thy return, how thou mayest go over the
fishy sea.&quot; 2
In the following passage Odysseus narrates how, hav ing arrived &quot; at the place which Kirke mentioned,&quot; he fulfilled her commission :
1 Buckley well expresses dissatisfaction with this rendering. Volcker translates the term &quot; ein niedriges Gestade.&quot; It is per haps the low-down shore as contrasted with the upper or opposite one.

HOMERS ABODE OF THE DEAD. 475
Then Perimedes and Eurylochos made sacred offerings ; but I, drawing my sharp sword from my thigh, dug a trench
the width of a cubit each way, and around it we poured liba tions to all the dead, first with mixed honey, then with sweet wine, again a third time with water, and I sprinkled white meal
over it. And I much besought the unsubstantial heads of the dead, promising that when I came to Ithaca I would offer up
in my palace a barren heifer, whichsoever is the best, and that I would sacrifice separately to Tiresias alone a sheep all black, which excels among our sheep. But when I had besought
them, the nations of the dead, with vows and prayers, then taking the sheep, I cut off their heads into the trench, and the black blood flowed ; and the souls of the perished dead were assembled forth from Erebos, betrothed girls and youths, and
much-enduring old men, and tender virgins having a newly
grieved mind, and many Mars-renowned men wounded with
brass-tipped spears, possessing gore-besmeared arms, who in great numbers were wandering about the trench on different sides with a divine clamor; and pale fear seized upon me.
Then at length exhorting my companions, I commanded them, having skinned the sheep which lay there, slain with the cruel
brass, to burn them, and to invoke the gods, both A ides
and Persephone. But I, having drawn my sharp sword from
my thigh, sat down ; nor did I suffer the powerless heads of the dead to draw nigh the blood, before I inquired of Tiresias.
So far it might appear uncertain whether the hero were really in Hades, or only near it, at some point accessible alike to the living and to the dead. But the lines imme
diately following show that he was truly in &quot; the house of Aides :
&quot;
And first the soul of my companion Elpenor came, for he
was not yet buried beneath the wide-wayed earth ; for we left
his body in the palace of Kirke, unwept-for and unburied, since another toil then urged us. Beholding him I wept, and
pitied him in my mind ; and, addressing him, spoke winged
words :
&quot; O Elpenor, how didst thou come under the dark west ? Thou hast come sooner on foot than I with a black
ship.&quot;



4/6 APPENDIX.
Thus I spoke, but he groaning answered me in discourse :
&quot; O Zeus-born son of Laertes, much-contriving Odysseus, the evil destiny of the deity and the abundant wine hurt me. Ly
ing down in the palace of Kirke, I did not think to go down
backward, having come to the long ladder ; but I fell down ward from the roof, and my neck was broken from the verte brae, and my soul descended to Hades.&quot;
In line 69, Elpenor speaks of Odysseus &quot; going hence from the house of Aides /
&quot; and in line 164, as elsewhere
(x. 502; xi. 59, 158; xii. 21; xxiii. 324), the expres sions leave no chance to doubt that Odysseus voyage
was a genuine descensus ad inferos?Here, then, are the two grand tests of every proposed solution of the problem of the location of the Homeric
Hades :
I. Its Hades must be underneath the earth ; and
II. // must be on the surface of the earth, beyond the Ocean.
This strange and perplexing difference, not to say con
tradiction, in the Homeric representations, did not escape the notice of the older commentators and writers on
mythology. Especially has it called out the ingenuity
of German scholars. F. A. Wolf recognized it, but did
not profess to be able to give an explanation. J. H. Voss invented the method of solving the problem by placing Hades itself within the bosom of the earth-disk, but its &quot;entrance&quot; on the westernmost point of Europe on the inner shore of the ocean. Volcker rejected this solution,
but, in the absence of a better, cautiously suggested as we have seen the possibility of Homer s having held to two kingdoms of the dead, one within the earth, and one
1 See Preller, Mythologie, vol. i., pp. 504, 505, where he says that the region visited was &quot;die ganze und wirkliche Unterwelt, nicht

in the dark trans-oceanic West. 1 Eggers 2 and Nitzsch * inclined to the support of the Vossian compromise ; and
in 1854 Preller could still speak of it as the one &quot;at
present chiefly prevalent.&quot;
4
Still, as Preller and others
urged, nothing in the descriptions of the western Hades corresponds with the idea of a &quot;
portal
&quot; or &quot; entrance &quot;
to a subterranean world extending so far eastward as to be situated under Greece and Asia Minor :
5 hence the latest interpreters have been as free as were the earlier to take their choice among the wild and contradictory
conjectures classified at the beginning of this paper. The latest of these guesses is that of Jordan ; and, though it comes within a hair s-breadth of the truth, it has been the most ridiculed of all. 6
As pointed out in earlier pages, the one false principle which has vitiated and confused all modern discussions of Homeric cosmology is the groundless notion that the earth of Homer is a flat disk. This mistaken presup position is responsible for the failure of all hitherto at tempted demonstrations of the true location of the poet s
Hades. Once conceive of the Homeric Cosmos as rep

Homer,&quot; and the problem of the site of Hades is solved at a glance. It is the southern or under hemisphere of
the upright spherical earth. In this conception, whatso ever is &quot; trans-oceanic &quot; is also and of necessity
&quot; subter
ranean.&quot; Now for the first time can it be understood how Leda and her noble-minded sons can be &quot; on a geo graphical extension of the earth &quot; on the farther shore of
the Ocean, and at the same time i/e/a^ev y&amp;gt;}s (Od., xi. 298). In this Cosmos, Hades cannot be beyond the
Ocean without being also underneath the earth. On the
traditional theory of a flat earth, the passage is and ever must be the palpable inconsistency which Volcker represents it. Even the theory of two or of twenty Homers does not reasonably explain it. Precisely so with the passages relating to Elpenor. His soul at death goes Kara x$ovo5, yet it is found with the other ghosts in the shadowy land just across the Ocean-river. So again with the passages relating to the shades of the slain Suit ors. These reach the Underworld (xxiv. 106, 203) ;
but it is by a route along the surface of the ground to the Ocean-stream, in full sight of the gates of the sun and of
the stars of the Milky Way (xxiv. 9-1 2 ).
1 Illustrious scholars have accused the poet of Widerspriiche grbber und arger than usual in this account ;
2 but the whole trouble has been, not in the poet, but in the poet s inter
preters. With the spherical earth, all is consistent and precisely as it should be. In this reconstructed Homeric
Cosmos, every crosser of the Ocean-stream, whether it be Hermes, or Odysseus, or Herakles, reaches the groves of Persephone and the house of Aides. Wherever Kirke s isle is located, the &quot; blast of the North wind &quot; will drive the voyager thence towards the realms of the dead. In like manner it can now be understood how the stolen

and the fishy sea. 1 Though the god has power to pene trate the solid sphere, 2 it is down no yawning chasm that his chariot disappears. As far as we can trace him and
his victim, they are still at the surface, simply moving from the upper to the lower hemisphere. 8 In perfect accordance with the requirement formulated by Volcker,
Odysseus and his companions descend (xi. 57, 476), while the ghosts ascend (xi. 38), to reach the meetingplace on the lower edge of the Ocean-stream. Beautifully exact and strikingly natural is now the poet s declaration that Tartaros is &quot;as far below Hades as earth from heaven,&quot; a declaration as fatal to many of the fifteen or
more traditional explanations of Homer s Hades as it is to Flach s elaborate and ingenious diagram of the Hades of Hesiod. 4 With this inverted hemisphere for the king
dom of the dead, Voss need not longer trouble himself about the mention of &quot; clouds&quot; therein. 5 In fine, with the correct Homeric conception of the earth and of Hades, the manifold alleged contradictions of the poet instantaneously vanish. Better than that, the dual im

HOMER S ABODE OF THE DEAD. 481
ages of Hades, which have so long perplexed and blurred the vision of Homeric interpreters, suddenly resolve
themselves into one perfectly focused stereoscopic pic ture of startling vividness and beauty.
One ground of misgiving and doubt may possibly still
occur to cautious minds. &quot;Is it credible,&quot; it may be
asked, &quot; that the early Homeric Greek, unschooled in the exercise of the scientific imagination, could picture to himself that pendant under-surface of the earth as habit able even by ghosts? Could he so long before Newton s
day have gained such knowledge of gravitation as to see
how infernal rivers and infernal palaces could cling to an under-hemisphere ? That Aristotle and the Greek philos ophers of his age were able, we know from their writ
ings ;
1 but is it credible that the Greek of the Homeric
age was equal to such a task ? This proposed conception of Hades requires that we should think of a world where
everything is upside down, exactly contrary and antip
odal to our own. Can we believe that prehistoric men could achieve such a prodigy of abstract thought ?
&quot;
A pertinent and perhaps sufficient answer to these
questions might be given by pointing to a most curious and instructive funeral-custom among the modern Karens of Burmah. This tribe is certainly not more highly gifted or more highly civilized than were the Greeks of the heroic age, yet they have precisely this Homeric con
ception of an antipodal Hades. A most competent author ity gives us the following account :
&quot; When the day of burial arrives, and the body is carried to the grave, four
bamboo splints are taken, and one is thrown towards the West, saying, That is the East; another is thrown to the East, saying, That is the West ; a third is thrown up wards towards the top of the tree, saying, That is the foot of the tree ; and a fourth is thrown downwards, saying,
1 See Dr. H. W. Schafer, Entwickelung der Ansichten des Alterthums tiber die Gestalt und Grosse der Erde, Leipsic, 1868, quarto.

482 APPENDIX.
That is the top of the tree. The sources of the stream are pointed to, saying, That is the mouth of the stream ; and the mouth of the stream is pointed to, saying, That is the head of the stream. This is done because in Hades
everything is upside down in relation to the things of this
world.&quot; *
Striking, however, as would be this answer to the ques tioner, a better can be given. The better one points out to him the foolishness of the assumption that either the Greeks or the Karens originated for themselves their con ceptions of Hades. Both simply inherited from their fathers the old pre-Hellenic Asiatic idea of an antipodal Underworld. Ages ago the notion which underlies the Karen s rites was so prominent in the mind of the East Aryans that the sudden and inevitable reversal of the
points of the compass, consequent upon entering the Un derworld, became a poetic circumlocution to express the
idea of dying : thus,
&quot; Before thou art carried away dead to the Ender by the royal command of Yama, . . . before
the four quarters of the sky whirl round, . . . practice the
most perfect contemplation.&quot;
2 Ages ago the notion which underlies the southward voyage of Odysseus led
prehistoric Akkadians, in naming the cardinal points of the compass, to designate the South as &quot; the funereal point;&quot; and in locating the kingdom of the dead, to place

In like manner the mountain of the gods &quot; le point culminant de la convexite de la surface de la terre&quot; he places not in the North (Is. xiv. 14), but often in the East or North-east.

This is certainly a mistake, for the Akkadian expression mer kurra, &quot; the cardinal point of THE MOUN TAIN,&quot; must, at least originally, have signified the North. And as to Lenormant s location of the antipodal mountain of Hades in the West or South-west, our latest German writer upon the subject, Dr. Friedrich Delitzsch, an eminent Assyriologist, affirms that in the cuneiform literature thus far known he has discovered no trace of such a location.

Bibliotheca Sacra, 1 868, pp. 84, 86. Still more recently Reginald S.
Poole has remarked, &quot; Now that we recognize the Vedic source of a
part of the Greek pantheon, and its generally Aryan character, we may fairly look elsewhere for that which is not Vedic. If embalming were derived from Egypt, why not the ideas which the Greek saw surrounding the custom, the pictures of the Underworld, with its
judgment, its felicity, and its misery ? The stories which Homer
makes Odysseus tell, when he would disguise his identity, show the
familiarity with Egypt of the Greeks of the poet s time.&quot; The Con
temporary Review, London, 1881, July, p. 61. It would be better to
say that Homer s Hades, while agreeing with the Egyptian and Baby
lonian and Vedic, was not necessarily &quot;borrowed&quot; from either of these peoples, but more likely agreed with the Egyptian, Babylonian,
and Vedic, simply because in each case there was a common inherit
ance, a survival of still more ancient ideas of prehistoric ances tors. 8 Records of the Past, vol. x., p. 88. 4 Tiele, History of the Egyptian Religion, p. 67 :
&quot; The heaven (at

while Maspero, despite his language in Les Conies Poptilaires de Pgypte Ancienne (Paris, 1882, pp. Ixi.-lxiii.), in a private letter of
still more recent date admits the possibility that the Egyptians held to such a view as long ago as eighteen centuries before the Christian era. In this connection it may be useful to state that Professor

The assertion sometimes made, that the Egyptian Amenti was just over the hill to the west of Abydos,1 is only worthy of such cosmologists as Popsey Middleton, or the still more illustrious author of the &quot; Zetetic Astronomy.&quot;
About a thousand years before Abraham went down
into Egypt, at least, that is the date assigned by Egyp
tologists, a scribe engrossed upon a papyrus a fair copy
of a tale of shipwreck. It is now one of the treasures
of St. Petersburg. At the Congress of Orientalists, held in Berlin in the year 1881, its existence was first made known to the modern world through the translation then submitted by M. GolenischefL The tale proves to be a
kind of anticipation of the voyage of Odysseus to the realm of Aides. As in the Odyssey, it is the ship-com mander himself who narrates his adventures. There is
no imaginative and poetic vagueness about the details. The ship was one hundred and fifty cubits long, forty broad. The crew consisted of one hundred and fifty men. Upon the Ocean he is wrecked, his crew lost ; he himself,
however, is driven upon an island in the neighborhood of the nether world of the dead. Indeed, the place itself was called &quot; The Isle of the Double ;
&quot; and it was, as
Maspero believes, peopled by Shades invisible to the
voyager only because he was as yet in the body. The
king of the island was a huge serpent, thirty cubits long, and possessed of a wonderful beard. 2
Tiele informs the present writer that he has abandoned his conjec ture touching Cher-nuter, expressed in his Vergelijkende Geschiedenis van de Egyptische en Mesopotamische Godesdiensten, Amsterdam, 1872, p. 94; French edition, 1882, p. 51 ; English edition, 1882, p. 72. 1 As, for example, by Marius Fontane, Histoire Universelle, Les

In what direction lay this mysterious land ?
Not in the West, where all our Egyptologists persist in locating Amend, but in the South. Directly up the Nile, and out into the Ocean at its head-waters, lay the voya ger s track. As in the case of Odysseus, so many centu ries later, it was the blast of the North wind which bore
him thither. 1 In conclusion, if both the ancient Egyptians 2 and Chaldasans 3 believed that like as the stars of the northern hemisphere are set over the realm of the living, so the stars of the southern hemisphere are set over the realm of the dead ; if in ancient Hindu thought &quot; the gods in heaven are beheld by the inhabitants of hell as they move with
their heads inverted; &quot; 4 if in Roman thought

attention of Mannhardt, and led him to remark, &quot; Da auch die kel

Notwith standing this, Mr. Stuart, a few pages later, so powerful is the in

and Antarctic, as well as the intermediate regions of the globe ; there have been established eighteen Polar stations, and upwards of forty auxiliary stations ; the observations have been made during the year which will end with the present
month that is, between September i, 1882, and September i, 1883 ; they have been made and recorded daily, and bear upon the same identical points of inquiry. This scheme of obser vation originated with Lieutenant Charles Weyprecht, an Aus trian explorer of fame, who, however, did not live to see it
carried into execution. He first broached it at a meeting of German naturalists and physicists held at Gratz on Septem
ber 1 8, 1875. The plan was formally approved at a meeting
of the International Meteorological Congress held in Rome in the spring of 1879. an d its details were perfected at other meetings of the same body held in Hamburg, October i, 1879, and at Berne, August 7, 1880. Finally, on August i, 1881, ten
delegates, of whom General Hazen, chief of the United States
Signal Service, was one, met at St. Petersburg and organized
an official Polar Commission. All the members of this com
mission had authority to act for their respective governments. The Polar stations were assigned among the nations as fol
lows : The United States, at Lady Franklin Bay, Grinnell Land, and Point Barrow, Alaska ; Great Britain and Canada, at Fort McRae and Fort Resolution, on the Great Slave Lake, in British America ; Denmark, at Godthaab and Upernavik, on the west coast of Greenland ; Germany, at Hogarth Inlet, Cumberland Sound ; Austria, at Young Foreland, Jan Mayen Island, north of Iceland ; Finland, at Soudan Kyla, in Lap land ; Holland, at Dickerson Haven, mouth of the Yenisee River, in Russia ; Norway, at Bossekop, northwestern coast of Norway ; Sweden, at Mosel Bay, Spitzbergen ; and Russia,
at Moller Bay, Nova Zembla, and Lighthouse Point, at the mouth of the Lena River. The Antarctic stations are those of Germany, on the South Georgia Islands ; France, at Cape
Horn ; Italy, at Punta Arenas, in Patagonia ; and the Argen
tine Republic, at Cordoba. The Polar stations are all within thirty degrees of the North or the South Pole, and the auxil iary stations are spread over the rest of the habitable globe. In his original presentation of the scheme Lieutenant Wey precht remarked that the unsatisfactory scientific results of the various Arctic and Antarctic expeditions are owing mainly to two causes : first, that the primary object of these expedi



LATEST POLAR RESEARCH. 489
tions has been geographical discovery, while scientific investi gation was secondary; and, secondly, that these individual
voyages have been of an isolated character, and hence the ob
servations made are necessarily deficient as compared with
what would be gained by a properly scientific investigation,
which should obtain, for combination and comparison, memo randa of magnetic and meteorological observations simultane ously made in all parts of the world under a uniform system. Such an investigation, he said, would be feasible only by the united action of the great nations of the world. By the plan adopted, the following schedule of work was agreed upon for each of the several stations : Meteorological
observations : temperature of the air, temperature of the sea, barometric pressure, humidity, direction and force of wind, kind, amount, and motion of the clouds, rainfall, and weather and optical phenomena. Magnetic observations : absolute de
clination, absolute inclination, absolute horizontal intensity, variations of declination and inclination, and variations of hor izontal intensity. All these observations were considered ob ligatory, and were to be made at each station hourly each day, excepting on the 1st and I5th of each month, when the read ings were to be made every five minutes. The following obser vations were considered desirable, and doubtless have gener
ally been made : Variations of temperature, with height, solar radiation, evaporation, galvanic earth currents, parallax of the aurora, spectroscopic observations on the aurora, ocean cur rents, tidal observations, structure of ice, density of sea-water, atmospheric electricity, and the force of gravity. The several expeditions were started in season to arrive at their respec
tive stations by the date assigned for beginning, September i, 1882. . . . The station of the party of Lieutenant Greely at Lady Franklin Bay is the most northerly one of the whole, and is but about eight degrees south of the Pole. It is very difficult of access on account of the masses of ice that collect in Baf fin s Bay. It was arrived at in a vessel by Lieutenant Greely,
though the start was made a year in advance of most of the other expeditions, under an apprehension that the vessel might be stopped by ice, and a long journey have to be made over
land. The consequence is that the observations of this party began in the fall of 1881. It was the intention, however, to remain two years, and various stores were laid in and arrange

merits were made accordingly. Early in the summer of 1882 a steamer was sent by the government with supplies for the party, but was unable to reach them because of the ice. The supplies were left at points designated beforehand by Lieuten
ant Greely, whence he could convey them to headquarters by
sledges. Another party was started this summer, and if they
cannot reach him by navigation will employ sledges and push
north till they meet him. He has instructions to retreat this season by sledge in the contingency of the non-arrival of a
vessel, and to come down the coast of Grinnell Land. Either by vessel or on these coast-line sledge journeys the two par
ties will undoubtedly meet, and probably something definite
will be heard from them by the end of September. 1 . . .
Point Barrow is on the northern or Arctic Ocean shore of Alaska, in latitude 72 north. The party stationed here is in
charge of Lieutenant P. H. Ray. A relief vessel visited the
place in the summer of 1882, and found all well. The obser vers reported that the preceding winter had been long and severe, but not exceeding in these respects what had been ex pected. Hourly meteorological observations had been kept up uninterruptedly from October 17, 1881, and magnetic observa
tions from December i. From that date to August i, 1882, over 90,000 readings of the magnetic instruments were taken, and a corresponding amount of meteorological work had been done.2
Last summer, just before the world had learned of the rescue of Lieutenant Greely, the commanders of all the different stations, Greely alone excepted, held a con ference in Vienna, and congratulated each other and the scientific world upon the success achieved.

grandest and most beneficent enterprise in which the Christian nations have for centuries, if indeed ever, en
gaged. Most remarkable, perhaps, of all is the fact that in these several expeditions more than five hundred men, of various nationalities, were kept more than a full year
within the Arctic Circle, transported thither and returned, and yet, but for a single mistake in provisioning one of the parties, not one life would have been sacrificed. What could be fuller of promise with respect to the future
of polar exploration ? It is to be feared that stratigraphic and paleontologic questions have had too little consideration on the part of the scientific commissions which have planned the latest (as well as the earlier) Arctic expeditions.

&quot; Is memory capable of preserving through successive generations the facts of history, or whatever else peoples are continuously interested in knowing ? At first one is
apt to say No, remembering how seldom two people can agree in their recollection of even the briefest saying or commonest occurrence. But look into the matter. Note how the power of memory differs in different people, and
how it may be cultivated, and especially how it strength
ens when systematically depended on, while, when little is left to it, it weakens. It is a small fact, but not with
out significance, that among the first things which chil dren are set to fix in their memories, apart from any idea
of sacredness, are long series of historical names, dates, and events, English kings, American colonists and
presidents, far exceeding in difficulty those Israelitish histories which Kuenen thinks cannot be trusted because
only preserved by memory. This shows that it is less a question of the power of memory than of how far memory is looked on as sacred, and guarded so as to hand on its contents unimpaired. As for evidence of the power of memory, what better can we desire than the well-known fact of the transmission of the Iliad, with its 15,677 lines,
for generations, perhaps for centuries, before it was even written ? Yet even that is a mere trifle compared with the transmission of the Vedas. The Rig Veda, with its 1017 hymns, is about four times the length of the Iliad. That is only a part of the ancient Vedic literature, and the whole was composed, and fixed, and handed down by
memory, only, as Max Miiller says, by memory kept under the strictest discipline. There is still a class of priests in India who have to know by heart the whole of the Rig Veda. And there is this curious corroboration of the fidelity with which this memorizing has been car

ried on and handed down : that they have kept on trans mitting in the ancient literal form laws prohibiting prac tices that have nevertheless become established. Suttee is now found to be condemned by the Vedas themselves.
This was first pointed out by their European students, but has since been admitted by the native Sanskrit schol ars. Nothing could show more clearly the faithfulness of the traditional memory and transmission. It has, too, this further bearing on the date of the so-called Mosaic legislation : it shows that the fact of customs existing in
a country for ages unchallenged does not prove that laws condemning such customs must necessarily be of later origin. But there is more that is instructive in the trans mission of this Vedic literature. There has been writing
in India for twenty-five hundred years now, yet the cus todians of the Vedic traditions have never trusted to it.
They trust, for the perfect perpetuation and transmission of the sacred books, to disciplined memory. They have
manuscripts, they have even a printed text, but, says Max Miiller, they do not learn their sacred lore from them. They learn it, as their ancestors learnt it thousands of years ago, from the lips of a teacher, so that the Vedic succession should never be broken. For eight years in
their youth they are entirely occupied in learning this. They learn a few lines every day, repeat them for hours, so that the whole house resounds with the noise ; and
they thus strengthen their memory to that degree that,
when their apprenticeship is finished, you can open them like a book, and find any passage you like, any word, any
accent. And Max Miiller shows, from rules given in the Vedas themselves, that this oral teaching of them was
carried on, exactly as now, at least as early as 500 B. c. 1 &quot;Very much the same was it with those Rabbinical schools amid which the Talmud gradually grew up. All of that vast literature, exceeding many times in bulk

Homer and the Vedas and the Bible all together, was, at any rate until its later periods, the growth of oral tradi
tion. It was prose tradition, too, which is the hardest to remember, and yet it was carried down century after cen tury in the memory ; and long after it had been all com mitted to writing, the old memorizing continued in the schools. Indeed, it has not entirely ceased even now,
for my friend Dr. Gottheil, of New York, tells me that he
has had in his study a man who thus knows the entire Talmud by heart, and can take it up at any word that is
given him, and go on repeating it syllable by syllable, with absolute correctness.
&quot; In the presence of such facts, surely we must be pre pared to revise our ideas of what memory is capable of, ideas derived from the very limited uses for which we usually depend on it now. Such facts show that
memory, consolidated into tradition, is perfectly com petent at least to act as an accurate instrument for
transmitting along many generations whatever men are very anxious to have remembered. It is simply a ques
tion of being anxious and of taking special care.&quot;
After other interesting and impressive illustrations, drawn from the history of peoples in the most diverse states of culture, the writer closes as follows :
&quot; If there is
anything in these facts which I have collected they mean at least this : that we may take up again the discarded
traditions of the old heroic ages, and of the world s morn ing time, with far more confidence than has been usual of
late years. Homer will be read with a new interest, and Herodotus, and best of all the world-old histories of the Bible. I know they will not give us detailed narra tives by which this or that point can be proved, or names or dates to be learned off as school-boy tasks. But they
will give us glimpses of the ancient days ; pictures here
and there of such men and women as loved and fought in those old buried cities of Hissarlik, or meditated by the Ganges, or wandered from Chaldea with Abraham, or

followed Moses out of the mighty empire of Egypt into those wild solitudes of Sinai, pictures of life ; land marks of great deeds and thoughts and worships and laws ; a dawn to the history, not of abstract theories, nor
of dazzling sun-myths, but of real peoples and real men.&quot;
