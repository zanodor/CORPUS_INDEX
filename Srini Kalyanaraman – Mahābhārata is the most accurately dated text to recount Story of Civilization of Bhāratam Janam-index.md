Mahābhārata is the most accurately dated text to recount Story of Civilization of Bhāratam Janam
Mahābhārata is the most accurately dated text to recount Story of Civilization of Bhāratam Janam with Jyotiṣa pramāṇa. Kaliyuga has arrived in Śrī K ̥rṣṇa's lifetime. Prāptaṃ kaliyugaṃ viddhi, says Sri K ̥rṣṇa MB 9.59.21 Śalyaparva: 'Kaliyuga has pierced in, arrived'.
Hanuman tells Bhima Sena in Vanaparva 3.148.37 that Kaliyuga has already arrived एतत्कलियुगं नाम अलिराद्यत्प्रवततते युगानुवततनं ेत्व ुतत्कवतन्ति लिरजीलवनः
गोिोकं गच्छ शींघ्र ंत्व सांर्ध गोकु िवालसल ः । आरात्किेरागमनं कमतमूिलनकृ िनम् ।। ११ ।। (ब्रह्मवैवततपुराणम् /खःण्ड ४ (श्रीकृ ष्णजन्मखःण्ड ). Approach of Kali, destroyer of germs of good deeds, is impending or near at hand. आगमनं āgamanam (of Kali) PLUS आरात् ārāt 'immediate'.
This श्रीकृ ष्णजन्मखःण्ड ह्मब्रवैवततपुराणम् reference is emphatic Jyotiṣa pramāṇa. This relates to Śrī K ̥rṣṇa's life as kiśora 11-year youth in Goloka; the context is early life of Krishna. His birth is at 11.40 PM Friday 27 July 3112 BCE.
The context is kiśora Śrī K ̥rṣṇa's killing of Kamsa--the raison d'etre of Krishna avatāra. Date is 18 Feb.3102 BCE; just as Narasimha avatāra is to kill Hiraṇyakaśipu; Varāha avatāra is to kill Hiraṇyākṣa. All the avatāra are to restore dharma, to remove evil rulers.
Thus, 18 Feb. 3102 BCE is the date of start of Kaliyuga when Śrī K ̥rṣṇa kills Kamsa; the date is affirmed by Jyotiṣa siddhantin with reference to the skychart which shows extraordinary assemblage of planets heralding itihāsa unfolding, dharma restored.

This is what Śrī K ̥rṣṇa tells Balarāma during the Gadāyuddham between Bhimasena and Duryodhana, to explain Bhimasena hitting Duryodhana on the thigh. The date is November 3067 BCE; see skymap on the start date of the war.
The date Nov. 22, 3067 is affirmed by Manish Pandit. I am grateful to Pandit for his commendable efforts to promote a consensus among astronomers who have variant text readings.

36 years after the MBh war, Śrī K ̥rṣṇa avatāra ends. All the MBh war events occur AFTER the onset of Kaliyuga on 18 Feb. 3102 BCE when dharma is restored after Śrī K ̥rṣṇa kills Kamsa and ends the evil rule.
Māgha Paurṇamāsa day is the start date of Kaliyuga; confirmed by Jyotiṣavedāṅga (of Lagadha) https://tinyurl.com/4uwevf5k -- Month of Magha (Tapas), bright fortnight begins the (Kali)Yuga -- Jyotiṣavedāṅga (of Lagadha)
Conclusion: Mahābhārata is the most accurately dated itihāsa text in the history of civilizations, provides specific tithi-s & skymaps for key events of the Great Epic War, the sheet anchor of Story of Civilization of Bhāratam Janam (RV 3.53.12).
