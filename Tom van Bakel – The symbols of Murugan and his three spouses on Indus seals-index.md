The symbols of Murugan and his three spouses
on Indus seals
To this day, Murugan is an important god in India and some other Asian countries, he is venerated and commemorated in several festivals such as: ‘Skanda Sashti’ and ‘Thaipusam’.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kartikeya
Examining the Indus seals it became increasingly clear that Murugan was by far the most important god in the Indus Valley Civilization. But at that time he was presented differently than now.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kartikeya#/media/File:Murugan_by_Raja_Ravi_Varma.jpg
Today ‘Most icons show him with one head, but some show him with six heads reflecting the legend surrounding his birth where six mothers symbolizing the six stars of Pleiades cluster
who took care of newly born baby Kartikeya’.
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kartikeya)
His wives are the storm goddess Devasena and the river goddess Valli. The moon goddess Shashthi is his wife too, but only instead of Devasena.
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashthi)
In addition, Murugan is identified with four different gods, namely: Indra, Varuna, Vishnu
and Kali.
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kartikeya)
However, in the Indus Valley Civilization, among other things, Murugan was depicted as a compound animal composed of six other animals, and he had three women instead of two: Devasena, Valli, and Shashthi, who were completely equal to each other. He was indeed identified with Indra, Varuna and Vishnu, but the fourth god was Surya instead of Kali.



M-1170a
I start this essay with this compound animal which has three heads. As far as I am concerned it represents Murugan and his three wives. Since this is not immediately clear, I would first like to tell you something about the next seal:
M-311
On this seal the inscription clearly has two so-called ‘combs’ or ‘knives’ signs. When two identical signs are placed next to each other, this often indicates a Holy Marriage. Here this Marriage is also symbolized by the tiger/woman:
o The woman with her meandering horns is the river goddess Valli, o The back part of a tiger represents Murugan: according to a legend he turned into a tiger on behalf of the river goddess. (See page 5.)
Together, the back part of the tiger and the woman symbolize the union of this Murugan with Valli.



M-1171
Here we see something similar: the three heads represent Devasena, Shashthi and Valli and the back part with a pizzle represents Murugan.
Dholavira
And here is exactly the same, the three heads represent the three goddesses and the back part represents Murugan. But Murugan, who’s name means ‘The Youth’, has also been portrayed as a young man sitting on the back of this compound animal: in this way, all four gods are clearly recognizable.



M-1430 A
Murugan and his three spouses
This side of a three sided tablet also depicts the same: Murugan sitting on the back of a three-headed animal. As usual this means that the whole tablet is dedicated this god, which means that we are able to make some interesting links.
M-1430 C
For instance, here Murugan is depicted as a bull being killed. He is identified with Surya: and just like the sun god he is pierced through and through with darkness:
Rigveda 5-40 called: ‘Indra. Surya. Atri’. 5 ‘O Surya, when the Asura's descendant Svarbhanu, pierced thee through and through with darkness,
All creatures looked like one who is bewildered, who knoweth not the place where he is standing. (-) 8 The Brahman Atri, as he set the press-stones, serving the Gods with praise and adoration, Established in the heaven the eye of Surya, and caused Svarbhanu's magic arts to vanish. 9 The Atris found the Sun again, him whom Svarbhanu of the brood Of Asuras had pierced with gloom. This none besides had power to do.’
On the left his three wives are watching him being slaughtered.
M-1430 B
And on the third side of the tablet Murugan is depicted as an animal composed of six different animals. Unfortunately it is unclear on this tablet but on a number of seals this animal is clearly displayed and there it has a young boy's face as the name ‘Murugan’ means ‘The Youth’.



M-478 B
On this tablet Murugan/Kartikeya is depicted in yet another way, namely as a tree. In a legend Kartikeya turned into a ‘Vengai’ which means both ‘tiger’ and ‘neem tree’ and on both sides of this tablet he is represented by neem trees:
‘In Tamil Nadu, there is a legend that Subramaniam (another name of Kartikeya), the son of Shiva and the forest mothers, loved an aboriginal virgin named Valli. To win her love he turned himself into a ‘vengai’, a tiger. ‘Vengai’ is also the name given to the neem tree in its male aspect before it flowers.’
Book of Durga, by Chitgopekar, Nilima
This tablet shows that Kartikeya has different relationships with his wives:
o On the left, the river goddess Valli sits in a neem tree while she chases her husband having the shape of a tiger. o On the right side we see that the storm deities Devasena and Indra uproot two neem trees while Kartikeya, depicted like a tree man, himself stands in the middle.
M-478 A
This is the other side of the tablet:
o On the right his third wife Shashthi (the moon goddess is symbolized by a pitcher) may sacrifice soma in a pitcher to the neem tree of Kartikeya. o Incidentally, the figure between the two lines is the river goddess Valli.



Bhirrana 2
We return to a seal with a three-headed animal. The interesting things about this seal are the two signs, which allow us to identify the different heads:
o In the first place, the cow's head belongs to the storm goddess Devasena who drinks soma just like the Indra. o The head of the unicorn, which is marked by a U-sign, belongs to Shashthi. o The goat's head, marked by the simplified sign of a prisoner, belongs to the river goddess Valli.

prisoner
A prisoner is more clearly depicted on this tablet: here it is visible that his arms are tied behind his back.

He resembles this Egyptian hieroglyph.
In the Indus Valley the water level of the rivers was low in winter. This situation was turned into a myth in which the rivers were held captive by the drought. In March, Indra arrives with his thunderstorm, defeats the drought and frees rivers.:
Rig Veda hymn 4-22 called ‘Indra’
7 ‘With joy, O Indra, Lord of Tawny Coursers, the Sisters then, these Goddesses, extolled thee,
When thou didst give the prisoned ones their freedom to wander at their will in long succession’.



Kalibangan-37 Kalibangan-34
Goats are associated with rivers and on these seals this is emphasized by two fish.
H-32 a
The unicorn is initially the sun god Vishnu. He unites with the moon goddess Shashthi and this intercourse is symbolized by the U-sign with the four dashes. Man and woman are depicted equally and therefore Shashthi has the head of a unicorn.
M-1886 a Bull with three horns
On this seal Murugan has the shape of an Indra bull drinking soma. By the way, in the inscription is a figure with three horns. As the photo shows, there indeed are three horned cows and in a Rigveda hymn, Indra is a steer with triple horn:
Rigveda 5-43 called: ‘Visvedevas’.
13 ‘May the Sustainer, high in heaven, come hither, the Bounteous One, invoked, with all his favours, Dweller with Dames divine, with plants, unwearied, the Steer with triple horn, the life-bestower’.



H-179 B Bull with three horns
Devasena is related to Indra and on the tablet she has three stripes on her head. In addition, there is another photo of a bull with three horns.
H-179 A
o In the middle of the back side of this tablet stands Devasena with her three stripes. o To the left is the U sign, which symbolizes the union of Murugan with Shashthi. o And on the right is a prisoner sign symbolizing Valli.
This means that we basically see four deities here: Murugan, Shashthi, Devasena and Valli.
M-1982 a
Again these signs symbolize four gods:
o The U-sign with the four dashes symbolizes Shashthi united with Murugan. o The figure with three horns instead of a head represents Devasena. o And the fish represents Valli.
On the following tablets and seals we see the same signs next to each other.



M-375
o All inscriptions on the seals depicted on this page begin with the U sign that symbolizes the union of Murugan with Shashthi, o The second figure is Devasena with her three horns instead of a head. o And Valli is represented by a prisoner or by fish.
M-1881 H-76
On these two seals the Murugan/Indra bull drinks soma.
H-23 M-116 M-79 a
M-1005 M-647 M-1678 a
On these six seals Murugan/Vishnu is depicted as a unicorn.



M-248
In the middle of the inscription is a so called ‘rake’ sign which is depicted on many seals. It
is similar to a Sumerian archaic sign meaning ‘gal’, which can be translated as: ‘big’:
:
Archaic Sumerian Pictographic Signs by Ashur Cherry
However, in the Indus valley it means: ‘to get big’, ‘to grow’, ‘to wax’ or ‘to increase’:
Rig Veda hymn 6-19 called ‘Indra’
11 ‘The Bull, whose strength hath waxed, whom Maruts follow, free-giving Indra, the Celestial Ruler, Mighty, all-conquering, the victory-giver, him let us call to grant us new protection’.
H-1775 A
This means that on this tablet the 'rake' sign symbolizes that Devasena increase in strength, just like Indra:
Rig Veda hymn 2-11 called ‘Indra’
1. ‘Hear thou my call, O Indra; be not heedless: thine may we be for thee to give us treasures; For these presented viands, seeking riches, increase thy strength like streams of water flowing.



M-595 A
o All inscriptions on the seals depicted on this page begin with the U sign that symbolizes the union of Murugan with Shashthi, o The second figure is Devasena with her three horns instead of a head. o The 'rake' signs symbolize that Devasena increase in strength. o And Valli is represented by a prisoner or by a fish.
H-31 M-144
On these seals Murugan/Vishnu is depicted as a unicorn.



Harappa
Once again, the three heads represent the three goddesses and the back body with the pizzle represents Murugan. Besides that, Murugan is also depicted as a human sitting on the back of this compound animal.
M-211 M-648
Here Murugan is added to the inscription, so there is:
o A youthful who represents Murugan, o A U sign, which symbolizes Murugan united with Shashthi, o Devasena with three horns instead of a head o And Valli represented by a fish.
M-199 M-1746
And these seals 'rakes' are in the inscription symbolizing that Devasena grows in strength.



When Kartikeya unites with his wives, this is not without significance: together they produce fish, grain and children. When we study the seals again we often see on the right side two dashes and a diamond or a womb sign. These dashes, diamonds and wombs indicate that the goddesses brings forth grain and children.
M-493 B
I end this essay with this side of a three-sided tablet. The other sides are very unclear. Nevertheless here we can see three naked figures. Although they usually are called ‘dancers’ I think they are the three spouses of Murugan who are about to give birth to children.
