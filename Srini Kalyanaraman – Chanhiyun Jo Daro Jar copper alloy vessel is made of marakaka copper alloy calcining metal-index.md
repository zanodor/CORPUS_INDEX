I submit that copper alloy was called marakaka 'copper alloy, calcining metal' signified by the hieroglyph maraka 'peacock.' This is signified on a terracotta jar also from Chanhiyun Jo Daro which is painted with 'peacock' hieroglyph in memory of the departed coppersmith. The wavy lines painted on the pot signify: காண் டம்2 kāṇṭam , n. < kāṇḍa. 1. Water; sacred
water; நீர.் துருத்திவாயதுக்கியகுங்குமக்காண் டமும் (கல்லா. 49,
16).ayaskāṇḍa ‘a quantity of iron, excellent iron’ (Pāṇ.gaṇ)2. खाांडा [ khāṇḍā ] m A jag, notch, or indentation (as upon the edge of a tool or weapon). (Marathi) Rebus: khāṇḍā ‘tools, pots and pans, metal-ware’.

BCE. These new pottery styles seem to have been introduced at the very end of the Harappan Period. The transitional phase (Period 4) at Harappa has begun to yield richly diverse material remains suggesting a period of considerable dynamism as socio-cultural traditions became realigned. https://www.harappa.com/indus2/164.html
Excerpt from: Hieroglyphs of Indus Script on painted burial pots and lid Cemetery H Harappa and 'In Memoriam' Meluhha elegy https://tinyurl.com/ycbclull
I submit that the Indus Script inscriptions on burial pottery of Cemetery H at Harappa are “In Memoriam” presented as an orthographic, Meluhha elegy, or a poem in memory and praise of one who has died, documenting the deceased person's metalwork competence and contributions the person made to the wealth of the guild and the nation..
A sherd of pottery with humped bull and birds, Indus Valley, Harappa, c2600 BC.
The composite animal of storage pot has the hieroglyphs: zebu, horns of markhor, black drongo, star, peacock. The readings are:

maraka 'peacock' rebus: marakaka 'copper alloy, calcining metal'
Hieroglyph, signifier: mora, 'peacock' Rebus signified metalwork: morakkhaka loha, 'a kind of copper'; moraka 'a kind of steel'. mora peacock; morā ‘peafowl’ (Hindi); rebus: morakkhaka loha, a kind of copper, grouped with pisācaloha (Pali). [Perhaps an intimation of the color of the metal produced which shines like a peacock blue feather.] moraka "a kind of steel" (Samskritam)Thus, Rupaka or metaphor is: marakaka 'copper alloy, calcining metal'.
Peacock as a Meluhha hieroglyph The Munda word for peacock marak/mara "cryer, peacock", later Sanskrit māra (and Pali etc) 'death, God Death', the Munda peacock symbol = death, and the Cemetery H peacock pictures on urns with cremated bodies. Peacock and heaven (marak = peacock; merxā_ = sky, heaven ?may the soul go to heaven)
Parji. marp- (mart-)= to lighten; Kurux. merxā_ = sky, heaven; Malto. mergu = sky, heaven; see Te.merūmu = flash of lightning.
Late Harappan Period dish or lid with perforation at edge for hanging or attaching to large jar. It shows a Blackbuck antelope with trefoil design made of combined circle-and-dot motifs, possibly representing stars. It is associated with burial pottery of the Cemetery H period, dating after 1900 BCE.

(DEDR 4642) I suggest that the early form of the word for peacock is: māˊrā (Savara); maraka 'peacock' with likely roots in Austro-Asiatic word forms. This may explain the signifier of peacock on Karen bronze drum as a catalogue item of metalwork. This may also explain the signifier of two bronze peacocks flanking a bronze pine cone, on a Vatican monument in the area around Hadrian's Mausoleum (117-138 C.E.) known today as Castel Sant'Angelo. It was a fountain in which pilgrims could wash themselves formed of the great bronze pine cone which now forms the focal point of the Cortile della Pigna in the Vatican Museums.
See:
Bronze peacocks in the Vatican are made by Bharatam Janam and an Indus Script hieroglyph 'a type of steel' http://tinyurl.com/z2xcphj
Vatican should return to Bharatam the two peacocks and a 11 ft. high pinecone since they were all made of hard bronze (moraka, steel) by Bharatam Janam, the Bronze Age artisans and represent the pinnacle of Bronze Age revolution. The artifacts of unsurpassed artistry, the pinnacle of metalwork artifice, are unparalleled in the history of civilizations. They were taken from the Temple of Isis/Serapis which were constructed with the participation of ancient Indian artisans, seafaring merchants.
Bronze peacocks, together with 11 ft. high pine-cone of bronze in the Vatican are made by Bharatam Janam and Indus Script hieroglyphs.

Temple de Serapis. This temple was built for the Egyptian merchants. It was located on the Commercial Agora near the western gate. There is also another entrance into the temple from the south-west corner of the Agora through stairs. There are certain indications that suggest the temple was never finished fully. It is estimated that the construction of the temple was started in the 2nd century CE. Temple of Isis, Pompeii. "the original building built under Augustan was damaged in an earlier earthquake of 62 CE...The cult of Isis is thought to arrived in Pompeii around 100 BCE."
