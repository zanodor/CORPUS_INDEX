Preface
Research activity in Indo-European comparative mythology has been
regularly pursued at the University of California, Los Angeles, since
the academic year 1959-60, when the Seminar in Indo-European
Mythology was held for the first time. Other organizational milestones
have been the creation of the Center for the Study of Comparative
Folklore and Mythology in 1961 and of the Section of Indo-European Studies as an autonomous part of the Department of Classics in 1964.
Workers from many fields—anthropology, classical languages, Eng¬
lish, folklore, Germanic languages, Indo-European studies, Slavic
languages—have participated in these endeavors. Numerous research papers have been written and discussed over the years. A succession of research assistants (Anastasia Demetriades, C. Scott Littleton, Robert
Gartman, Eleanor Long, Antoinette Botsford) have helped lay an exhaustive bibliographical and documentary groundwork under the
auspices of the mythology section of the Center. At least two pub¬
lished doctoral dissertations have drawn their inspiration and incep¬ tion from these efforts (C. Scott Littleton, The New Comparative
Mythology: An Anthropological Assessment of the Theories of Georges Dumezil [Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1966], and Donald
Ward, The Divine Twins: An Indo-European Myth in Germanic Tradition [Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1968]).
In a purely historical sense, the activity has centered on discovering
and understanding the mythic, religious, social, and legal underpin¬
nings of the ancient Indo-European-speaking continuum in terms of their oldest or most archaic manifestations. In a comparativistic vein,
these materials have been used as starting points for prehistoric re¬
construction. The theoretical viability of such attempts is enhanced
by the renascence of the discipline of Indo-European comparative

mythology during the past several decades through the efforts of such scholars as Georges Dumezil, Jan de Vries, Stig Wikander, and others.
Thereby the long lacuna that ensued upon the largely abortive theoretical beginnings by F. Max Muller, Adalbert Kuhn, and others in the nineteenth century can securely be declared closed, and a present-day comparative mythology proclaimed as firmly established,
fortified by the material gains and theoretical lessons of an entire
century. Most of the works gathered into this volume were originally pre¬ sented at a symposium held under the joint auspices of the Center
and of the Section of Indo-European Studies on March 17-18, 1967. Postfixed to their printed versions is a bibliographical inventory of
scholarly works that constitute the documentation of the new Indo
European comparative mythology. Thanks are due the Chancellor of the University of California,
Los Angeles, for a subsidy toward the cost of publication, Wayland

Language of Gods and Language of Men:
Remarks on Some Indo-European
Metalinguistic Traditions
CALVERT WATKINS, Harvard University
The fundamental work on “language of men” and “language of
gods” is Hermann Giintert’s Von der Sprache der Gotter und Geister1 which presents a detailed examination of this figure in two Indo
European traditions: the Homeric poems and the Alvissmgl of the Old Norse Poetic Edda. More recently, the figure has been analyzed
by R. Lazzeroni.2 In Homer we have a total of six instances of the figure. Four of
these contrast two lexical items, as belonging to the language of men and gods, respectively; the typical formula is (Iliad 14. 290
291)
opvLdi. \Lyvpfj kvaXlynios, f]v r’ kv opetrai
XuXKida KLt<hri<TKOvcri deoi, avSpes 8i KvpivSiv.
Here we have the contrast between two appellations for the same
bird: KvpivSis (men) and x<A/ds (gods). In the other three, we have
personal and local names. Thus, giving first the name in the language
of men,
a hill Barteia: arjp.a iroXvanapOpoLO Mupivijs (Iliad 2.813-814);
the river SKdpavSpos: Eavdos (Iliad 20.74);
a giant Alyaluv' Bptapecos (Iliad 1.403, etc.).

In two instances we have only the “gods’ word”: p.S>Xu Se pav Kaheovoi
Otoi (Odyssey 10.305) and IIXaYKTds dq tol rds ye deol paxapes naXkowiv
(Odyssey 12.61). In all the cases where there is an opposition, as Guntert recognized,
the term attributed to the language of men is the normal Greek designation of the object, place, or being, and that attributed to the language of the gods is a “poetische Umschreibung allgemeiner
Art.” Thus xaA/ds, ‘the xak/cos-colored’; Bpidpecos, ‘the strong (fipiapos',
note that the synizesis in the line of -«o- from -po- is generally a mark
of recentness).3 In arjpa Mvpivqs (following the scholia) we have a “scholarly” reference to a heroine cult which is quite Hellenistic in
effect. In these cases we have a metalinguistic poetic figure setting forth
explicitly a hierarchy in the lexicon: the relation between the desig¬ nations of the same entity on two levels of discourse. The lower level,
that of ordinary language, is figured as the “language of men,” while the higher and more restricted level of formal, poetic, or otherwise
exotic language is figured in this ancient metaphor as the language
of the gods.” This metaphor represents a conscious signalization of
an opposition existing in the lexicon, between the common, seman¬
tically unmarked term, and a rarer, more “charged,” semantically
marked term. On the plane of discourse the opposition is most
commonly (and clearly in the Edda, as we shall see below) that be¬
tween ordinary and poetic language in the widest sense.
There are words in the lexicon which for reasons having to do
with the culture have an immanent semantic charge or mark, without there necessarily existing any semantically unmarked equivalent.
Such a form is jluoXu, with its aura of black magic and taboo com¬
parable with that of mandrake, mandragora, and the like. It is a
semantically marked term, and as such is assigned to the language of the gods; there simply is no unmarked equivalent designation, hence
the absence of a term for men. It is characteristic of the Greek ex¬ amples that they are precisely not common ordinary lexical items,
in contrast with the Old Norse material. We do not have, for ex¬
ample, a putative opposition between a “human” term alpa and
a “divine” elap as the word for “blood.” For this reason it is well not to insist too much on the Homeric examples, which are complex in character. There are particular reasons in the Homeric poems why the paired designations appear when they do (only six times in
some 25,000 lines); these are connected with the metaphor itself and
3 Cf. P. Chantraine, Grammaire homerique, I (Paris, 1942), 37.
Language of Gods and Language of Men 3
the “divine association” of the entity or personage in question. They have been quite well analyzed by Lazzeroni, and there is no need
to go into them here. What is basic is the possibility of the contrast itself; Lazzeroni when separating entirely the Greek facts from those of Old Norse and other traditions goes too far in ignoring the basic
fact that the human term in both traditions is the neutral, seman¬
tically unmarked member. This system is far clearer in the verses of the Alvissmgl, where there are thirteen stanzas of the following typical configuration; the
translation of the terms merely aims at being diacritical:
Stanza 9 [Thor:] segdu mdr fiat, Alviss . . . hvd su iprd heitir . . . Stanza 10 [Alviss:] igrd heitir med mgnnum enn med asom fold
kalla vega vanir igrcen igtnar alfar groandi kalla aur upregin
[Thor:] tell me that, Alviss . . . how the earth is called . . . [Alviss:] earth it is called by men and by the Aesir land the vanir call it way green the giants the elves growing the upregin call it sandy soil.
Despite the superficial proliferation of synonyms and associate divine
beings, we have in reality merely the elaboration of a poetic figure opposing a single genuine pair of lexical items as “human” and “divine.” The greater complexity of the “divine” set is a reflex of
a more complicated pantheon of divine and otherworld beings and
of the necessity of filling out the system. In all cases but two (“sea” and “grain”) the word used by Thor
in his question “how is x called” is the ordinary, unmarked “human” word; the exceptions are introduced for the sake of alliteration. That
the poet saw no contradiction in Thor’s using the human word is
to be expected, and shows that the metaphor was indeed just a meta¬
phor. Similarly in Homer, where the gods speak men’s Greek. In all thirteen cases the word attributed to men is still the normal
word for the object in Modern Norwegian, as Einar Haugen informs
me. By contrast, in nine cases the word attributed to the gods is a genuine, semantically marked poetic word, as we know from other
texts, whereas the words assigned to the other beings are of drastically
lower frequency. Perhaps the greatest merit of Giintert’s work was to point out the



4 Calvert Watkins
role of alliteration in the distribution of the synonyms and the beings assigned them. The verse scheme requires a bridge of alliteration
between the two hemistichs of the first line, which always begins with the men’s word in the first hemistich. We may in fact set up two basic
ordered rules: (1) if the men’s word begins with a vowel, the gods are called eesir for alliteration and the choice of the god’s word is
free; (2) if the men’s word does not begin with a vowel, the gods are called god and the god’s word must alliterate with the men’s word. When rule 1 applies, we get a genuine opposition between the
unmarked term and the rarer, poetic term:
earth (st. 10) iprd : fold fire (st. 26) eldr : funi
The case of pi, ‘ale’ : biorr, ‘beer’ (34) is apart, for technological
reasons; the hierarchy is there, but it is an economic or gastronomic one rather than a semantic one, the opposition being apparently
between the old native brew without hops (pi) and the new, more expensive, and better-tasting brew with hops (biorr). In the remaining cases, where rule 2 applies, there may be a genuine opposition, if the existing poetic synonym happens to
alliterate:
heaven (st. 12) himinn : hlyrnir moon (st. 14) mdni : mylinn sun (st. 16) sdl : sunna calm (st. 22) logn : Icegi night (st. 30) nptt : nidi grain (st. 32) bygg : barr
But if the poetic word does not alliterate with the normal word, it
is assigned to a group other than the god, and an alliterative word
is invented for the designation by the god.
sea (st. 24) seer : marr (dvergar)
and probably
wood (st. 28) vidr : eldi ‘firewood’ (iptnar)
In the remaining two cases, sky, ‘cloud,’ and vindr, ‘wind,’ no genuine opposed term existed which could be brought into the system of
alliteration, and the terms in the whole series are simply inventions
of the poet, as Giintert showed. The remaining terms attributed to other beings are in a large
measure ixirati Xeyojuera; they are all kennings, transferred mean¬ ings, or other poetic creations, doubtless the work of the author of
Language of Gods and Language of Men 5
the Alvissmpl himself. Their repartition among the remaining divine or otherworld beings is to a large extent governed by alliteration,
as is the occasional permutation of one divine group for another. Compare the constant of words in initial v- for the vanir, in h- for the beings i helio. The whole is, as H. Gering termed it4 “ein versifiziertes
Kapitel aus der skaldischen Poetik,” and indeed a quite artificial
literary showpiece and tour de force. It is thus clear that in the Alvissmpl text what is basic is the binary opposition “human : divine,” the poetic figuration of an opposition in the lexicon semantically unmarked term : semantically marked
term. There may be genuinely more than one of the latter, as prob¬ ably in Old Norse bygg : barr, sad, and more can always be freely
created, as the rest of the A Ivissmpl shows, but this does not alter the fundamental structural set; an English equivalent would be horse :
steed, mount, charger, and so on. As E. Benveniste has so well ex¬ pressed it,5 “II est dans la nature des faits linguistiques, puisqu’ils
sont des signes, de se realiser en oppositions, et de ne signifier que
par \k," and this is equally valid for the lexicon of a language.
Giintert further pointed out the existence of the same poetic figure in early Sanskrit literature, in the Satapatha-Brahmana (10.4.6.1).
Since he cites only the translation, I give the passage here:
hayo bhutvS dev&n avahad vajl gandharvan arva asuran asvo manusyan
as haya he carried the gods, as vajin the gandharvas, as drvan the asuras, as dsva men.
The semantic opposition is dsva : haya, vajin, drvan; the unmarked term is the normal inherited Indo-European word for horse (Lat.
equos). It is important to note, as Giintert did not, that all three of the
semantically marked, noble, poetic terms are also found as such in
earlier Vedic literature, in the Rig-Veda passim. The choice of one
or the other of them is indifferent; what is relevant is only the seman¬
tic opposition of each to dsva as marked to unmarked.
In the hymn to the sacrificial horse (1.163) we find vdiin and &rvan several times as terms of direct address (vocatives) to the horse about to be sacrificed, whereas in this hymn a'sva is used only in neutral,
declarative context.

(Paris, 1966), p. 175.

In another hymn (7.74.4) we find asva and haya coexisting in the
same mantra:
asvaso y6 vam upa dasuso grham yuvam dfyanti bibhratah maksuyubhir nara hayebhir asvina A deva yatam asmayti
Your horses which fly, bringing you to the house of the sacrificer, with [these] swift horses come here for us, O heroes, O gods Asvin.
The relative sentence is worth noting, for it shows a sentence of an
archaic paratactic Indo-European type which recurs most clearly in
Hittite: the antecedent of the relative clause appears both in the relative clause and in the succeeding main clause. (This type is also
of interest for the general syntactic theory of the relative sentence.)
Thus in Hittite:
nu-mu l£-ir kuit eSta nu-kan ISTU t-YA dISTAR nRUSamufia fiantiyanun
and the house which I had, and with my house I was true to Istar of Samufia.6
and
INIM.MES-ar-ta (= uddar-ta) kue memiskimi nu-mu uddanas GESTUK-an para lagan bark
the words which I speak to thee, to my words [thine] ear hold inclined,7
and
nu-za KUR URTJTapapanuwa kuit dan EGIR-pa esat nu KUR URUTapapanuwa arfia warnuir
and the land of Tapapanuwa which was seditious a second time, and they burned the land of Tapapanuwa.8
Such Hittite relative sentences have an evident structural similarity
to the Vedic relative sentence quoted above. But there is an interest¬ ing stylistic difference. The noun asva modified by the relative clause
is not simply repeated in the following main clause; rather it is there replaced by the equivalent but more semantically marked noun
haya. Thus for an underlying relative sentence of the Indo-European
type:
aSvaso yi dfyanti the horses that fly, *aSvebhir & yatam come with the horses _ t. 6 A. Gotze, Hattusilis (Leipzig, 1925), p. 46. 7Song of Ullikummi, First Tablet, A III 38-39’; see H. G. Giiterbock, JCS 5:154 (1951). 8 A. Gotze, Die Annalen des MurHlis (Leipzig, 1933), p. 174
Language of Gods and Language of Men
is substituted as a stylistic figure
asvaso yi dfyanti hayebhir 1 yatam
It is clear that such a particular stylistic “transformation”—of lexical substitution in a determined syntactic position—is explicable only
in terms of a semantic hierarchy in the lexicon: unmarked asva —> marked haya. It is equally evident that this hierarchical relation be¬
tween the terms asva and haya existed in Indie prior to Rig-Vedic
times, and was continued intact until the time of its different poetic configuration as “language of men” and “language of gods” in the Satapatha-Brahmana. It is the semantic hierarchy that is basic, and
the metaphor of “language of men” and “language of gods” is de¬
rived from it; for this reason I would hesitate to ascribe the metaphor
itself to a putative Indo-European poetic “doctrine” as some have done; I prefer to regard it as an independent (and quite natural)
creation in the traditions that show it. It may be that the semantic hierarchy of asva and haya is older
still. As noted, asva is the well-known IE *ekwo-. The word haya, alone among the semantically marked words for “horse,” has a cog¬
nate in Armenian, ji (gen. jioy), the normal (semantically unmarked) word for horse; vis-a-vis Sanskrit it has moved down a step in seman¬ tic mark. But Sanskrit asva has also an exact cognate in Armenian
(fide R. Godel): the word is es (gen. isoy) and the meaning is ‘donkey.’ We know from Iranian tradition (Videvdat 7.42) that the donkey
(Avestan xara-) was considered the least worthy of the staora, ‘Gross
vieh,’ below the horse, and it is not unlikely that a similar view pre¬ vailed among the Iranianized Armenians. But the semantic shift
from “horse” to “donkey” would be difficult to understand except in the context of such a semantic hierarchy between ]i and es in
preclassical Armenian as we can observe between haya and asva in
Vedic. Since Giintert’s time the figure of language of men and language of gods has been reported for one other tradition: ancient Anatolian,
by J. Friedrich.9 Here we have such passages in Hittite as
tandukesni Tasimmetis, DINGIR.MES-nas-a istarna 0I8TAR-is SAL.LUGAL-as zik
to mankind you are Tasimmetis, but among the gods you are Istar the queen.10

Such passages in fact come from bilingual texts in Hittite and Hattie,
they are edited by E. Laroche.11 Some of the tablets are in the archaic
cuneiform ductus of the Old Kingdom, as noted by H. Otten.12 The tradition is thus old; but it is likely that this figure is a Hattie one
borrowed by translation into Hittite. All the examples of this figure concern the names or epithets of
deities; we never have any reference to an ordinary lexical item being assigned to the language of men or to the language of gods. For this
reason the Anatolian figure is not really comparable with that in Greek, and particularly Old Norse or Indie. Rather it reflects a
specific Anatolian cultic practice; it is basically more akin to the Greek hymnic tradition of invoking a divinity by a number of dif¬
ferent names or epithets than it is to the Homeric language of gods
and language of men. To my knowledge it has never before been noted that there exists
in early Irish an analogue to the figure of language of gods and lan¬ guage of men. It is found in one of the most curious of all Irish texts, the Auraicept na n-Fces, the “Scholar’s Primer” or “Handbook of the Learned,” as it is called by its editor and translator George Calder.13
It is a treatise on grammar and poetics, Filidecht, and compiled out
of elements of variable antiquity; the language is in the main Middle Irish, but has numerous traits requiring the supposition of antecedent
Old Irish material. Whereas the text shows considerable influence of Isidore and the grammarian Virgilius Maro, this element cleaily
represents an overlay upon a basic purely native Irish doctrine of poetic learning which is of enormous interest. The text and its doc¬ trine have been virtually untouched in Irish scholarship since Cal
der’s (scarcely definitive) edition of 1917’ anc^ remains a fertile field for investigation of Irish poetical and grammatical theory.
At a certain point in the text (1457, cf. 1236 et passim), the com
pilator is discussing the principle dialt didiu bunad cacha Gaedelge acht mod 7 tod 7 troth, ‘syllable [dialt] however, is the origin of all Gaelic except moth, toth, and traeth [the verbal symbols for mascu¬
line, feminine, and neuter gender].’ Calder correctly saw (pp. xlvi
xlvii) that this curious asseveration actually means that while the grammatical categories of number, case, person, degree, tense, and mood are all expressed by overt morphemes (prefixes, suffixes, end¬
ings), thus “syllables,” gender alone is not; it has no formal correlate _ r.

Language of Gods and Language of Men 9
in Irish substantives, but is simply an inherent, immanent property. It is a remarkable observation for the native Irish grammarians to
have made. Continuing the discussion of moth, toth, traeth, the compilator
adds (1493—1496): secundum quosdam cumad etarscarad indsci: isse, issi, issed iar Macaib Miled; uindius, uindsi, ondor iar Feraib Bolg;
mod, tod, traeth iar Tuathaib De Danand, ‘according to some, it is a distinction of speech: is e [it is he] is si [it is she] is ed [it is it] accord¬
ing to the Sons of Milesius; uindse [voila (the man)], uindsi [voila
(the woman)], ondar [voila (the thing)] according to the Fir Bolg, moth [everything male or masculine], toth [everything female or
feminine], traeth [everything neuter] according to the Tuatha De
Danann.’
In the long version of the Yellow Book of Lecan the passage reads (4554—4556): etargairi a n-innsgib: is e, is i, is eudh iar Macaib Miled; masgoul, feimin, neutor lasin Laitneoir; uindse, uindsi, oundar iar bFeraib Bolg; moth, touth, traothad la Tuaith De Danaan, thus
adding: “masculine, feminine, neuter with the Latinist.” In view
of the late character of these loan words, whose Latin origin was of course well known to the compilator of Auraicept, this passage is
probably an interpolation.
The three ways of specifying gender are thus attributed to succes¬ sive “legendary races” of men and gods which occupied Ireland: the
Milesians (Sons of Mil), ancestors of the Gaels; the Fir Bolg invaders;
and the ancient Celtic pagan gods, the Tuatha De Danann.14 Of the terms themselves, the most “normal” and semantically un¬ marked is that of the syntagm of copula plus pronoun, is efsifed. That the Irish in fact regarded these forms as giving the “key” to the gender
of a word is clear from Auraicept 617—620 where the phenomenon
is discussed, under the technical term erlonn (aurlann, airlann), ‘pre¬
ceding word, leading word [lit. butt end, handle]’: nasdefrigidar a tri urlundinnsci .i. a in remslonnudh .i. slointi rempu .i. riasna hinscibh
.i. ise isi ised, ‘their three leading words of gender distinguish them, i.e., their three antedenotations, i.e. denotations before them, i.e.,
before the genders, i.e., is e, is si, is ed.’ The notion is naturally de¬ rived from the normal sentence pattern beginning is e in fer (as), is
si in ben (as), ‘he is the man/she is the woman (who is).’ On the term erlonn (aurlann) see the Contributions to a Dictionary of the Irish
language (Royal Irish Academy), s.v. 2 airlann', the editors suggest it
14 The legendary history may be found in the Lebor Gabalach “Book of In¬ vasions.”

may be the same word as 3 airlann, ‘correspondence, analogy.’ One wonders whether it may not also be ultimately connected with 1 air¬
lann, ‘forecourt, open space before a residence, fort, or city,’ despite
the variation in declension. The forms uindse, uindsi, ondar are doubtless artificially intro¬
duced here; they have nothing to do with gender, and the repartition of the three forms as ‘voila’ implying a masculine, feminine, or neuter
object to be looked at (cf. Auraicept 648-649) finds no confirmation whatsoever in other texts. Probably the reason for their introduction
is the earlier section of the Auraicept (705 ff.), where there is discus¬ sion of the difference between uinse, ‘void, voila,’ and is e, ‘it is he,
he is.’ There is e is specifically called a “denotation of gender” (sluind
ceniuil, 712), in contrast with uindse. For the forms uindse, uindsi, ondar see M. A. O’Brien, triu 11:163 (1932); uind is doubtless im¬
perative 2 sing, active of the rare verb uindim, meaning ‘see, behold,’
and -se/-si are simply variant later spellings of the Old Irish 2 sing,
suffixed subject pronoun -siu. The “neuter” ondar would be the
imperative 3 sing, passive of the same verb. If the inclusion of these terms for gender is thus artificial, it follows that its attribution to the
Fir Bolg is likewise artificial. The real opposing member is the fol¬
lowing one. In moth, toth, traeth, particularly in view of the often repeated
maxim that “syllable is the root of all Gaelic save moth, toth, tiaeth
discussed above, we have a genuine and archaic designation of mas¬
culine, feminine, neuter. The terms are glossed respectively as each ferda, ‘everything masculine,’ each mbanda, ‘everything feminine,’
each neoturda, ‘everything neuter’; specifically the first two are also
used for the male and female sexual organs as well. As R. Thurneysen once said of another form, the terms moth and toth can “beliebig alt sein”; they were compared by O’Brien and Thurneysen with the Latin divine name Mutunus Tutunus,15 which shows the suffix
-unus occurring in other ancient Latin divine names like Neptunus.16
The origin of traeth is obscure; but it seems to be connected with the weak verb traethaid, ‘subdues, abates (verbal noun ti aethad, a variant of traeth in Auraicept 4568), and certainly was by the Irish
themselves (cf. Auraicept 1485). If so, we would have a noun meaning
‘abatement, suspension [of the categories masculine and feminine, or

the difference between them]’ and a concept akin to the modern lin¬
guistic one of “neutralization.”
We may venture the speculation that in the system moth, toth,
traeth were also erlonn (aurlann, airlann), ‘leading word,’ but be¬ longing to a grammatical doctrine of gender on a more theoretical
plane and/or older chronological level than the purely empirical
system is e, is si, is ed; the latter system can of course be only as old as the emphasizing construction is e in fer (as), which is a Celtic innova¬
tion. But in any case, however complex the legends involved, the two
sets are fundamentally opposed in the metaphorical figure of lan¬
guage of men (Gaels, the Sons of Mil) and language of gods (the
Tuatha De Danann), the two basic opposing groups in the Irish
invasion legend. Such a figure as this is to my knowledge unique in Irish literature.
That the compilator of the Auraicept introduced the figure by
secundum quosdam indicates that there was some sort of tradition;
but in view of the artificial character of some of the forms so con¬ trasted, and their attribution to vaguely historical or pseudohistorical
as well as divine figures, all unique to Ireland, it is scarcely likely that the figure or metaphor can be in any way considered an inheri¬
tance. Rather it would indicate the naturalness of the figure of at¬
tributing variant forms in the lexicon to whatever contrastable
groups exist in the traditional lore; Maicc Miled, Fir Bolg, and Tuatha D6 Danann in Ireland; manu.yyah, devah, gandharvah and asurah in India; menn, god, ebsir, vanir, igtnar, alfar, dvergar,
or cover terms like upregin in Iceland. From these examples it should be clear that the social groups can be multiplied to fit the number of synonyms or quasisynonyms in the lexicon to be contrasted. By the same token, as is quite clear in the Alvissmgl, the number of “syno¬ nyms” can be arbitrarily increased (by the invention of kennings and the like) to correspond to the number of groups of divine or semi¬ divine beings.
But however high the number of synonyms, it can always be re¬ duced to a basically binary opposition between the neutral, seman¬
tically unmarked member and one or more charged, semantically marked members. It is this basic opposition, a synchronic hierarchy
existing in the lexicon, which is metaphorically figured in the con¬
trast of the language of men (— unmarked member) and the lan¬
guage of gods (= marked member), as in Greece and Anatolia (both
Indo-European Hittite and non-Indo-European Hattie). If more
than one marked member exists, it is a simple matter to multiply (or
subdivide) the divine or semidivine groups, as in India and Iceland.



12 Calvert Watkins
In Christian Ireland, the attribution of the opposition directly to men: (pagan) gods would scarcely have been a natural one; hence we find here the opposition correlated with successive legendary races
invading and populating Ireland. The unmarked member is that of
the language of the Sons of Mil, ancestors of the Gaels, whereas the marked member is attributed to the historically antecedent divine
figures of the Tuatha De Danann. Yet this unique and isolated figure is not really the basic opposition
in the semantic hierarchy of the lexicon in native Irish tradition. For
this we must consider another passage in the Auraicept (1302) and
scrutinize the technical terms which it employs:
it e coic gne berla tobaidi .i. berla Fene 7 fasaige na filed 7 berla etarsgarta 7 berla fortchide na filed triasa n-agallit each dib a chele 7 iarmberla
These are five species of the Selected Language, viz.: Language of the Irish, Maxims of the Poets, Separated Language, Obscure Language of the Poets through which each of them addresses his fellow, and Unac¬
cented Language.
It is probable here that berla Fene, ‘Language of the Irish,’ is to be taken to mean ‘Ordinary Language,’ mentioned some time later
(1336) as the fifth category: iss e in coiced gne in gnat[h]berla fogni
do c[h]ac[h\, ‘the fifth kind is the ordinary language that serves for everyone.’ Compare from the Book of Ballymote (300b2) in gnathberla fogni do chach is e in berla bunaid no is berla topaide, ordinary lan¬
guage which serves for everyone, that is the foundation language; or
it is the Selected Language.’ Note especially that in Cormac’s glossary
gnathberla is opposed to senberla.17 Berla tobaide is the normal term for Gaelic in the Auraicept and
related glossatorial texts: tobaithe (in Old Irish form), cut, defined,
selected,’ is the past participle of to-fo-ben. An alternate form is berla
teipide (in Old Irish form belre teipithe), ‘cut, excised, fashioned,
selected,’ from to-ess-ben. These participial formations are particular¬
ly interesting in that they form a perfect pendant to the Indie terms samskxta-, ‘perfected; Sanskrit,’ beside prakrta- from prakrti, ‘la ma¬ ture brute du langage,’ as L. Renou defines it in his brief but char¬
acteristically illuminating discussion of these terms.18 The compilator of the Auraicept goes on to report that some au¬
thorities equate berla Feine, ‘Language of the Irish,’ with Fasaige

na filed, ‘Maxims of The Poets.’ On this basis, the expression fasaige na filed probably means ‘poetic language’ as opposed to gnathberla, ‘ordinary language.’ Berla Feine, insofar as different, refers to
poetico-juridical, “professional” language. The third term berla etarscartha, ‘separated language,’ refers to
the common Irish glossatorial practice of making fanciful etymolo¬
gies by segmenting and “stretching” words to form phrases, for exam¬
ple (Auraicept 1319), ros, ‘wood’ .i. roi oiss, ‘plain of deer.’ It is proba¬ ble that the “separation” of words in this manner reflected not merely
glossatorial practice for purposes of etymology, but also a genuine
practice of artificial deformation of words for poetic purposes. The
existence of archaic (presyncope) poetic technical terms like dichned,
lit. ‘beheading,’ which means “aphaeresis of the initial or apocope of
the final consonant,” points to the existence of a doctrine of word deformation going back to early times. Note that in the curious poems
at the end of the Auraicept (1962 ff.) dichned is one of the twelve
“faces of defense” (gnuis diten) of poetry against anocht, ‘error, in¬
correct form’; the latter is itself a form of Indo-European antiquity,
identical with Sanskrit an-ukta-, ‘unsaid, unsayable,’ as Thurneysen
saw. Dichned is also used in early Irish to describe the synchronic
formal relation between an ordinary, semantically unmarked word and a rarer, semantically marked word that can be synchronically
derived from the former by aphaeresis or apocope. Thus in Auraicept
390-391 the form epe, ‘cutting,’ is cited as the dichned of tepe, ‘id.’
Here te(i)pe, verbal noun of to-ess-ben, is a very common early Irish
form (both verb and noun), whereas e(i)pe, verbal noun of ess-ben
without the second preverb to, is an archaism occurring (outside
Auraicept) only in the Laws, and quotations from the Laws in O’Da
voren’s glossary; the finite verb ess-ben is scarcely attested.19
Even more striking is the case of the normal Irish word for “wom¬
an” at all periods of the language, ben < *gwena, whose dichned is given in Auraicept 1852 as be. The latter is a neuter noun, well at¬
tested in archaic or archaising early Irish poetry and rhetorics, and
clearly a part of berla na filed, ‘language of the poets’ (on which see
below). I find that my interpretation of this word as an ancient con¬ sonant stem *gwen- has been anticipated by W. Meid, and indeed
both of us by H. Pedersen.20 Meid and I differ in that he sees an old

neuter nom. *gwen, gen. *gwen-s, whereas I prefer an animate (or
feminine) nom. *gwen-s, acc. *gwen-m (whence archaic Old Irish bein, acc. of ben), gen. *gw(e)n-ds. The latter paradigm is, I suggest, also indirectly attested in Hittite nom. SAL-za (once SAL-anza), acc.
SAL-nan, gen. SAL-rcas.21 The form bein in the word for “woman”
may well have served as an important channel for the spread of *-m (*-en) as the accusative of feminine «-stems. The nom. tuath < *teuta, acc. tuaith < *teutm would thus imitate nom. *gwena (re¬
placing *gwens), acc. *gwenm. It is more likely that the word was originally animate (feminine) gender, as in Hittite. The transfer of a monosyllabic consonant-stem noun to neuter gender in Irish may
be observed also in the neuter det, ‘tooth,’ beside the animate (mascu¬
line) gender of the cognates in all other Indo-European languages. The term iarmberla in Irish grammatical tradition always means
‘unstressed word,’ and it is a remarkable tribute to the Irish gram¬ marians that they registered this feature of sentence phonetics: focul,
‘word’ = “stressed word.” The list of forms in iarmberla includes such categories as prepositions (iar, ‘after,’ ar, ‘for’), particles, con¬
junctions, and some adverbs (dano, ‘then,’ immorro, ‘moreover’) in¬
cluding conjugated prepositions functioning as adverbs (iarum, ‘then’; lit. ‘after it’), preposition plus article (forsna, ‘on the’), the sub¬
stantive verb atat, ‘there are,’ and constructs like edon, ‘id est,’ cisne,
‘how many are.’ All these are termed dialt n-etarlemmi, ‘interloping syllable’ for the poet, that is, they constitute the temps jaible of the
verse line, between temps forts of stressed words. This state of affairs
represents, of course, a linguistic feature equally characteristic of ordinary language.
The final term is berla fortchide na filed, ‘Obscure language of the poets’: fortchide is another past participle, ‘covered, concealed,’ from
for-tuigethar. It is more commonly referred to in Irish tradition as
simply berla na filed, ‘language of the poets.’ Berla na filed represents
a higher, more elevated, and more obscure form of poetic language than the “straightforward” poetic language termed fasaige na filed,
‘maxims of poets,’ although the difference is merely one of degree. It is the language of the “rhetorics” in Old Irish sagas, passages of verse or rhythmical prose clearly valued for precisely their obscurantism
and their bold contrast with the surrounding and transparent prose narrative.
Berla na filed relied for its effect partly on poetic devices like al¬ literation, partly on perturbations of normal Irish word order, but
21 Cf. already A. Gotze and H. Pedersen, Mursilis Sprachlahmung (Copenhagen,
1934). P- 65
Language of Gods and Language of Men !5
mostly on obscure lexical items that were otherwise lost in the ordi¬ nary language; in other words, archaisms. Compare senberla opposed
to gnathberla above.
The five categories of language enumerated by the compilator of Auraicept na n-Bces as such represent only a conventional pentad;
compare the five provinces of Ireland, the five banqueting halls of Ireland, or the Five Ways to Judgment. We may at once exclude
iarmberla (unaccented words), as referring to a ubiquitous feature of
the language. Similarly berla etarscartha (separated language) may be excluded, as referring to a particular technique, of native exegesis,
rather than to a type of discourse. Of the remaining terms, the first,
berla Feine (‘language of the Irish’) is equated by the Irish tradition
with either gnathberla (‘ordinary language’) or fasaige na filed (‘pro¬
nouncements of poets’): a genuine ambiguity or ambivalence that requires explanation.
As Binchy informs me, we know from the statements of later jurists
that certain rules are found isin berla, a phrase sometimes expanded
to isin berla Feine. We can thus equate berla alone with berla Feine
(the “professional” language). The fact that berla is used alone
shows that it must be the unmarked member of any semantic opposi¬
tion to a contrasting term. We may note also that berla Feine
(= berla) appears first in the list of the five sorts of language, another
indication that it is the unmarked member. Compare in grammar
the Latin first declension, first conjugation, or the first class of verbs of the Hindu grammarians.
The hesitation of the Irish tradition on the position of berla Feine is genuine, and reflects the relative position of the same element on
two levels of discourse; it is marked, poetic language by opposition to
ordinary language, but it is unmarked, ordinary “professional”
(gnomic-poetic-legal) language by opposition to the particular and specialized poetic form of speech known technically as berla na filed.
Following the lead of grammatical parallelism, we can establish three oppositions:
compound: gndthbdrla : senberla ordinary : old genitival: birla tb. Feine) : berla na filed professional : poetic participial: berla tobaide : berla fortchuide fashioned, selected : concealed.
Thus the most highly marked form of discourse in Irish is that which is archaic, uniquely poetic, and obscure: precisely the characteristic
of the so-called “rhetorics” in Irish saga. It is in these oppositions

that we find the genuine Irish counterpart of the opposition of lan¬
guage of men and language of gods in the metalinguistic traditions
of other Indo-European languages.
It is possible to make a further comparison, this time with Indie,
which might suggest that we have to deal here in Irish with a genuine
inheritance from an Indo-European poetic doctrine, a doctrine of
the nature of poetic language and its relation to ordinary language.
Consider the following mantras from the Rig-Veda (7. 87.4):
uvaca me varuno medhiraya trih sapta nama aghnya bibharti vidvan padasya guhya na vocad yug&ya vipra uparaya Siksan
Varuna said to me, the wise one: “The cow bears thrice seven names. He who knows the spoor should tell them like secrets if he wishes to serve as poet to the later generation.”
Let us note at once that the speaker of the quotation in the hymn is Varuna and the hymn is addressed to him, one of the principal deities of Dumdzil’s first function and one associated here with the
patronage of poetry. R. Jakobson points out to me the poet who is
Velesovu vnuku, ‘grandson of Veles’ (root *wel- as in Old Irish fili, ‘poet’) in the Slovo o Polku Igoreve.
Yet the Vedic poet is in fact calling to mind the same set of oppo¬
sitions between ordinary and poetic language as the Irish tradition.
The opposition between ordinary and old (Irish gnathberla :
senberla) is figured in the yngaya vipra uparaya: the poet is old
vis-a-vis the later generation.
The opposition between the simply professional and specifically
poetic (OIr. berla Feine : berla na filed) is precisely figured in the
contrast of the poet (the ego of the hymn) who is medhira before
Varuna speaks to him, and becomes vipra after the intervention of the deity.
Finally, just as in Ireland, one of the characteristics of this archaic,
poetic language is its obscurity (Irish fortchuide). Just so the thrice
seven names of the cow are guhya, ‘secret.’ And in Rig-Veda 4.5.3 padam na gor apagulham vividvan (guh-, ‘hide’) we have a participle in -ta-, ‘hidden,’ comparable both with the formation of samskrta, prakrta and with OIr. forchuide, ‘hidden.’ Indeed in th&<Rig-Veda the “secret name” or “word” (pada) (of the
cows, gods, and so on) is a quite common figure (some nine exam¬ ples.). Note especially guhyam nama gonam, ‘the secret names of the
Language of Gods and Language of Men 17
cows,’ a formula occupying the same metrical position (from caesura to verse end) in both Rig-Veda 5.3.3 and 9.87.3; This metrical feature
is in itself an index of archaism. The figure of the “secret name” or “word” frequently plays on the basic meaning of pada which is
‘spoor,’ as in the preceding example. Probably it had something to
do with the semantic development of pada, for example, originally
“secret word.” Another typical example is Rig-Veda 8.41.5.
yo usranam aplcya v6da namani guhya sa kavih k4vya puru rupam dyaur iva pusyati
He who knows the secret hidden names of the cows, as a poet/seer he greatly prospers poetic art as the bright sky its color
The message is virtually identical to that of 7-^7-4 above: knowledge
of the secret names establishes the poet in his prerogative. And I further suspect that when the Vedic poet uses aghnya, ‘she not to be
harmed,’ or usra, ‘she the gleaming one,’ for ‘cow’ here, instead of the neutral go- as in other passages, he is consciously utilizing one
of these “secret” names for the cow. We have to deal with a versified
“synonymy,” in a fashion similar to that of the Alvissmpl in Old
Norse. Specifically the technique is the introduction of a semantically marked synonym in place of the unmarked, “normal” variant, that
is, go-. We noted earlier the replacement of unmarked asva by marked haya in a determined syntactic context. Here we have an¬
other instance of the same poetic process. We have a formula guhyam nama gonam, which on metrical grounds may well be old. The ver¬
sion in 8.41.5 usranam . . . namani guhya is just such a stylistic transformation of this formula, by means of the semantic hierarchy
go —> usra, aghnya, . . . plus other trivial transformations of word
order, grammatical number, and so on, which may be discounted
here.



In Defense of Euhemerus
KEES W. BOLLE, University of California, Los Angeles
EUHEMERISM
It may be best to admit1 that my reflections on Euhemerus were motivated by the Wikander-Dumezilian interpretation of the Maha
bharata.2 It is one of the contexts in which the words “euhemerism” and “euhemerization” come up. Certain gods, functioning in an
early Indo-European mythical structure are “transposed,” so it is
said, into heroic figures. And as we know, Indo-Europeanists have to deal with a number of such “euhemerizing” transpositions. Next to
the Mahabharata, there are the first books of Livy, the saga of Had
ding in Saxo Grammaticus, and several themes and narrations in
Snorri Sturluson, to name some of the best-known euhemerizing
texts.
If anything is clear, it is the variety of these documents, and in¬
dubitably, the “transposition” remains an enigmatic procedure.
Since the name of the Greek Euhemerus is linked with the discus¬
sions, euhemerism as a Western intellectual fashion deserves some reflections. Thus I venture on this excursus in defense of Euhemerus
with the hope that in the eyes of specialists it will not be a raid on
his behalf.
It is a curious manner of reading and explaining myths which is
11 am indebted to Professor Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin and to Professor Truesdell S. Brown for their counsel in bibliographical matters. 2 For convenient references and bibliography see C. S. Littleton, The New Comparative Mythology: An Anthropological Assessment of the Theories of Georges Dumexil (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1966).

generally, and somewhat too easily, attributed to this romancier
Euhemerus (ca. 340-260 b.c.). This method can be summed up in
two words: historization and humanization. The information we
have about Euhemerus is scanty.3 The most important fragment of
his work, the most unmistakable one, we owe to the famous early Christian church historian Eusebius (ca. a.d. 300), who in turn owed
his information to Diodorus (first century b.c.), who quoted Eu¬ hemerus. (Book 6 where Diodorus begins to speak explicitly about Euhemerus is among the lost books of his history.) This information,
given to us in such a roundabout way, is nevertheless most important.
The story is well known and needs no elaborate rendering here. Euhemerus narrates how he once traveled to some islands in the East
and visited the people named the Panchaeans. The story is rather
fantastic. Euhemerus would have us believe for instance—assuming,
as is generally done, that this information given by Diodorus else¬
where also comes from Euhemerus—that from one of these islands,
at least from a promontory on it, on a clear day one could see India.
On the principal island a temple of Zeus is situated, Zeus Triphylios,
to be exact. There is a large golden pillar in this temple on which
Zeus himself had made inscriptions. In these inscriptions were re¬
corded the deeds of Zeus, of his father Kronos, and of his grandfather
Ouranos. For Zeus, like his grandfather and father, at one time was king of the inhabited earth. Like his ancestors, he received the honor of divinity because of the great tasks he performed for mankind. The nucleus of the theory, then, is simply that the gods at the time were
human beings, who came to be worshiped as gods because of their
acts on behalf of men. Admittedly, as a scholarly theory on the origin
of myth Euhemerus’ romance is hardly worth considering. But the
reason why a specific method of interpretation became associated
with his name was perhaps precisely that he wrote not a learned
treatise but something with a more popular appeal. And it seems to
me that there are two very important reasons why euhemerism is
worth considering from the point of view of the historian of religions.
The most conspicuous point of interest in euhemerism is its tenacity
in intellectual circles in the West; unabated it survived in eighteenth
century scholarship and lingered even in the nineteenth century.
Related to this is the fact I already mentioned that several documents
informing us on Indo-European mythology are somehow euhemer

istic. It is necessary to understand the nature of euhemerism to make
use of such documents. An additional reason for looking closely at euhemerism is the general, perhaps not too well-qualified deprecia¬ tion of it in modern scholarship. It is highly unlikely that the ideas generated by Euhemerus were
totally original. Generally critical evaluations of the ancient tradi¬
tions were not novel. Two centuries before Euhemerus another
Greek, the famous philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon, spoke
words that testify to the occurrence of more or less “eulremeristic”
tendencies even then. These words have been quoted many times
since: “But the mortals think that the gods are born and dress, speak,
and look just like they themselves do.”4 And “the Ethiopians imagine
that their gods are black and have snub noses, but the Tracians think
of their gods as blue-eyed and having red hair.”5 “If cows, horses and
lions had hands and could use them to paint and make artifacts,
as people do, then the horses would paint divine images like horses,
the cows like cows; they would create images appearing like them¬ selves.”6 It may be useful, though, to remind ourselves that this is
not the irony of some modern demythologizer. Another fragment
of Xenophanes adds: “[For there is] only one single God, the supreme
one among gods and people, unlike the mortals both in appearance
and in thought.”7 For every good and severe criticism or serious
doubt has another, positive side to it. In this context we may think
also of that philosophical giant Aristotle (384-322 b.c.), an older
contemporary of Euhemerus. Aristotle can hardly pass as an adherent
to traditional religion. Yet he was most impressed by perpetual,
regular motion. This he found in the cyclical course of the heavenly
bodies, as stated in De Caelo (e.g., 285a2g, 292820, 2g2bi). Corre¬
sponding statements are made by Aristotle in his Metaphysics (see 1074830). He makes a sharp distinction between traditional beliefs
and the divine nature of the heavens, and even speaks of the celestial bodies as “divine” (deios) bodies (Metaphysics 1074830). One pas¬ sage is so revealing that I like to quote it in full:
A tradition has been handed down by the ancient thinkers of very early times, and bequeathed to posterity in the form of a myth, to the effect that these heavenly bodies are gods, and that the Divine pervades the whole of nature. The rest of their tradition has been added later in a

mythological form to influence the vulgar and as a constitutional and utilitarian expedient; they say that these gods are human in shape or are like certain other animals, and make other statements consequent upon and similar to those which we have mentioned. Now if we separate these statements and accept only the first, that they supposed the primary sub¬ stances to be gods, we must regard it as an inspired saying; and reflect that whereas every art and philosophy has probably been repeatedly de¬ veloped to the utmost and has perished again, these beliefs of theirs have been preserved as a relic of former knowledge. To this extent only, then, are the views of our forefathers and of the earliest thinkers intelligible to
us. [Metaphysics io74bi-i4].8
In the same context in which Diodorus quotes Euhemerus a dis¬
tinction is made that is not without analogy to Aristotle s exposition.
Certain of the gods are said to be eternal and imperishable. It is
interesting to note that Diodorus expressly mentions that the ancients
have always known that. Such gods are, for instance, “the sun and
the moon and the other stars of the heavens” (“Fragmenta Libri
VI,” 1.2).9 And further “for each of these the genesis and duration are from everlasting to everlasting.”10 The appeal to tradition may
be invalid in terms of modern scholarship, both here and in the case
of Aristotle, but this question does not concern us here. The Dutch scholar Schippers has shown convincingly that this type of distinction
must have been part of Euhemerus’ world of ideas;11 evidently it was
a distinction of a sort that was already accepted in intellectual circles.
We learn from Diodorus that Euhemerus’ theory deals with the
second type of deity, and it is worth mentioning that here too Dio¬
dorus, and presumably also Euhemerus, makes a reference to tra¬
dition: “But the other gods, we are told, were terrestrial beings, who
attained to immortal honor and fame because of their benefactions
to mankind” (“Fragmenta Libri VI,” 1.2).12 This is the group to
which Zeus belongs, and the other deities who play a role in Eu¬
hemerus’ story. Certainly the existence of critical evaluations like those by Xeno¬
phanes and Aristotle should not lead us to believe that Euhemerus
was equally sharp in his criticism; if anything, he was conservative
in comparison. The distinction between natural gods and divinized

human beings, as recorded in the text of Diodorus, is much less radical and jibes well with the one certain knowledge we have of Euhemerus: that he attributed the divinization of certain people to
the vast positive value their exploits had for mankind. The fair account we owe to Eusebius (taken from Diodorus about
Euhemerus) contrasts favorably with the uses other early Christians
made of “Euhemerism.” Evidently Euhemerus knew himself that the
ideas he unfolded were not new. Also, his treatment of the gods
could not have been as offensive as we might think for the simple
reason that the Greek gods were very unlike the God of the Old Testament and New Testament. Rightly, this point has been stressed
by Professor Truesdell Brown.13 After all, the sacred traditions of
the Greeks were given in the form of stories, in which the gods act
among people and in many ways like them. The theory attributed to Euhemerus changed considerably under
the impact of growing Christianity. This change was neither abrupt
nor revolutionary, for in many quarters Imperial Rome saw the
growth of new multiform religious cults and ideas, and not in the
last place demonologies.14 More and more the pagan gods were seen
and explained as people elevated not because of their benefactions
and virtue but through their tremendous immorality. In fact, they
were demonic. Next to Euhemerism proper, a type of theorizing
becomes customary that is hardly worthy of the same name. It is a
euhemerismus inversus, an improper euhemerism. Yet, as I hope to
show, another name for this other theory would also be misleading.
For the moment let me just recall the difficulty we have in assessing
Euhemerus’ own intentions. We do not know enough of him or of
the spirit of his time to answer the question to what extent for instance irony played a role in his romance, and if it played a role,
what sort of role it was.15

PP- 255-266. 15 The diversity in scholarly interpretations of Euhemerus’ own intentions is indeed baffling. An elaborate discussion is given by Frank Susemihl, Geschichte der griechischen Litteratur in der Alexandrinerzeit (Leipzig, 1891), I, 316-322. On the one hand, Susemihl sees Euhemerus as one depicting to some extent his own ideals (p. 318), but he reproaches him also of “Plattheit” (p. 319), follows in the scholarly tradition to classify Euhemerus in more or less the same category as Lucian and Voltaire (p. 320), and concludes by saying: “thatsachlich war er ohne Zweifel ein unbedingter Atheist und ward denn auch vielfach als ein solcher angesehen” (p. 322).

When it comes to the divinization of people, ideas of a biblical
origin are much easier to fathom. Such divinization is a sinful affair.
The idea itself that the gods were glorified men is not limited to
the world of Greek intellectuals. The Wisdom of Solomon (ca. 80 b.c.)
is one of the apocryphal books. It was written in Greek but formed
part of the Septuagint. One passage clearly condemns the diviniza¬
tion of people and contemptuously attributes it to human need for
consolation. In the Wisdom of Solomon 14:15-17 we read:
For a father afflicted by untimely grief made a likeness of his child that had been quickly taken from him, and presently honored as a god him who was once a dead man, and handed down to his subjects mysteries and rites. Then the ungodly practice, strengthened by time, came to be observed as law, and by the orders of monarchs carved images were wor¬ shipped. And when men could not honor them in their presence because they lived far away, they imagined how they looked, far away, and made a visible image of the king they honored, so as by their zeal to flatter the absent one as though he were present.”16
Ideas like these, nourished by the biblical tradition spreading in the
process of European Christianization, helped to form a matrix for
improper Euhemerism. An important religious role in late An¬ tiquity was played by the oracular writings known as the Sibylline
Books. The third book begins with a biblical story (the Tower of
(Munich, 1925), II, 293-305. For Heinrich Dorrie (Der Konigskult des Antiochos von Kommagene im Lichte neuer Inschriften-Funde [Gottingen, 1964], pp. 218224) Euhemerus’ romance is the support of an ideology enabling kings to enhance their own political prestige. In fact, Euhemerus becomes much like a blueprint for apotheosis. Granted that “divine kingship” in late antiquity, beginning with Alexander, is a problem for scholars, this thesis—like the one that sees in Euhem¬ erus some modern blasphemer or atheist—begs the question. It ignores the enigma of existing traditions that made the very process of divinization possible and acceptable. Giovanna Vallauri (Evemero di Messene, testimonianze e frammenti, con introduzione e commento and Origine e diffusione dell’evemerismo nel pensiero classico, Pubblicazioni della Faculta di Lettere e Filosofia [Torino: Universita di Torino, 1956 and i960]) is very important in this context, because she addresses herself in the first essay precisely to the question what Euhemerus himself might have had in mind. Her writings are also noteworthy because of the scrupulous textual references. But this author, too, is mesmerized by socio¬ political views. There is little consideration for the fact that Euhemerus told a story. Euhemerus’ text becomes the crystallization of a sociopolitical ideology ac¬ celerating a process of religious decay (see especially Evemero di Messene, p. 23). All these diverse explanations of Euhemerus—personal crudeness, atheism, antireligious irony, jptopianism, commitment to one political ideology—have in com¬ mon that they are intent on taking away the strangeness of the data by substi¬ tuting something familiar to the modern author. 16 J. M. Powis Smith and Edgar J. Goodspeed, The Complete Bible (Chicago, 1948).
Babel) and a euhemeristic narration of a motif in Greek religion, whereby euhemerism serves to show the inferiority of paganism.17
Euhemerizations provided with a new edge by the biblical tradition
occur frequently in the Church Fathers and the medieval bishops.18
By the fourth century a.d. euhemerism, albeit of an amalgamated
nature, has become so widespread that Saint Augustine devotes some
lengthy reasonings to it. Specifically he feels that it is necessary to
discuss the honor paid by Christians to their martyrs in order to point out that such worship, such honor, differs from paganism. Many
reasonings of Saint Augustine are clearly euhemeristic. (In some pas¬
sages he shows himself familiar with the name of Euhemerus.) Thus
in The City of God (8.26) it is said: “with such blindness do impious
men, as it were, stumble over mountains, and will not see the things
which strike their own eyes, that they do not attend to the fact that
in all the literature of the pagans there are not found any, or scarcely
any gods, who have not been men to whom, when dead, divine
honours have been paid.”19 But for Augustine the pagan customs are
also an affair of demons. He concludes in the same section with a
peroration that clearly shows the amalgamation I mentioned before:
“it was the grief of the demons which was expressing itself through
his [Hermes Trismegistus’] mouth, who were sorrowing on account
of the punishments which were about to fall upon them at the tombs
of the martyrs. For in many such places they were tortured and com¬
pelled to confess, and were cast out of the bodies of men, of which they had taken possession.”
Considering the strength of Christianity and its spokesmen, it is
astonishing that euhemerizations could continue to flourish which
were not totally improper and could indeed serve as vehicles for
mythical motifs, for example, in Saxo Grammaticus. It would seem sometimes as if the negative potential of euhemerism provided the framework within which a “proper” euhemeristic construction could go on, preserving the mythological material.
THE POWER OF PRESERVATION
There is indeed one exceedingly important point in all those eu
hemerizing reasonings which a modern man is inclined to overlook.
It is simply this: that the historization and humanization, which, in

our terms, involve the making up of stories, do not rob a god of his
reality. In this respect euhemerism differs fundamentally from all
nineteenth- and twentieth-century popular intellectualism that de¬
clares gods and spirits nonexistent. The Christian apologist Lactan
tius is one of our sources for Euhemerus; he does not quote Euhemerus but provides a little treatise about him,20 and even this
militant Christian says that it is Jupiter who in the way he went about things, constituting his own worship, was very clever (“quod
ille astutissime excogitavit, ut et sibi honorem divinum et hospitibus suis perpetuum nomen adquireret cum religione coniunctum.”21 Schippers, in discussing this passage, adds a footnote to the effect
that actually it should have been Euhemerus who had thought these
things out so cleverly.22 It is revealing that Lactantius did not see it that way and apparently saw in Euhemerus an authoritative inter¬
preter. He found no reason at all to make a point that the very figure
of Jupiter was a figment of the imagination. Euhemerism’s power to preserve may well serve as a point of
departure in reflecting on some Indo-European fragments, on the
curious tenacity of the theory in intellectual circles and on its rejec¬
tion by modern scholars. Even though it is difficult to establish Euhemerus’ own psycho¬
logical attitude, it is obvious that he did not sneer at the gods. Cer¬
tainly no one would accuse Diodorus, that storehouse of facts, of an
overgrown sense of irony. Now it is interesting to note the manner
in which Diodorus (in one of the preserved books: Book 5) speaks
of the gods in the fabulous land of Panchaea (for the information
drawing on Euhemerus in all likelihood). For example, in 5.44 he
renders the local tradition concerning Ouranos. In this record the relationship of Ouranos and the sky—of course, well established in traditional lore—is perfectly preserved under the new euhemeristic
garb. There is a lofty mountain, he says, which is made sacred to the
gods and is called the “Throne of Ouranos” (Ovpavov SLcfpos); and he continues: “For the myth relates that in ancient times, when
Ouranos was king of the inhabited earth, he took pleasure in tarrying in that place and in surveying from its lofty top both the heavens
and the stars therein . . (5.44.6).23
Apparently the mythical narrative traditions were too strong either

In Defense of Euhemerus
for Diodorus or for his spokesmen to simply transfer Ouranos into the realm of “natural deities,” in spite of the fashionable fascination for the heavens. Instead, Ouranos is presented humanly—not, however, just humanly but as some ancient king-astronomer. Thus a theme
constitutive of the Ouranos myth is preserved. In the fragments of Book 6 the image of Ouranos is completed with explicit reference to Euhemerus: “. . . that Ouranos was the first to be king, that he was
an honorable (emaKris) man and beneficent (evepyeriKos), who was
versed in the movement of the stars, and that he was also the first to honour the gods of the heavens with sacrifices, whence he was called Ouranos or Heaven” (6.1.8).24 Clearly the words “historiza
tion” and “humanization” to sum up euhemeristic procedure must be used cautiously. The euhemeristic wordings contain much more than a reduction to mere human conditionings. Ouranos’ primary kingship, his knowledge of the stars, and his institution of sacrificial ceremonies for the gods of the heavens give Euhemerus’ account itself
the flavor of a myth of origins. Traits of a positive evaluation of ancient mythological tradition
can be pointed out in later Western texts. Not only were certain
themes of myths preserved, but I think we can see evidence of this positive attitude itself, in spite of the increased interest in demon¬
ology, in spite of changes brought by Christianity. Most eloquent
is a certain inner contradiction in Saxo Grammaticus (ca. 1200) and
in Snorri: on the one hand the traditional gods are not gods, on the
other hand the author cannot be silent concerning their divinity.
In the first book of Saxo’s Danish History a well-known curious
passage occurs about Odin, much like an interlude in the historical
account. It begins as follows: “At this time there was one Odin, who was credited all over Europe with the honour, which was false, of
godhead (falso divinitatis titulo censeretur) . . .” (1.7.1).25 This in¬
troduction hardly sets the tone for a sympathetic exposition of devo¬
tion to Odin, and the next couple of pages certainly strengthen that
impression. But one soon begins to wonder about the astonishing abilities of this “false” godhead. The kings of the North are eager
to worship Odin and make a golden image for him in his likeness,
much to his pleasure. Then Frigga, Odin’s wife, enters the story.
She is portrayed as a most wanton woman. She has the image stripped

by smiths, to use the gold for her own splendor. Odin hangs the
smiths and then Saxo tells us that he “mounted the statue upon a
pedestal, which by the marvellous skill of his art he made to speak
when a mortal touched it” (ibid.).62 Still this famous magic of Odin as reported does not conflict with Saxo’s personal reserves. He elabo¬
rates on Frigga’s low morals and greed, who even goes so far as to
submit herself “to the embraces of one of her servants” and to break
the image. And Saxo sighs: “. . . but what should I here add, save
that such a godhead was worthy of such a wife?” (ifoidl.).27 Yet Odin
is not depicted as deprived of a sense of honor. Filled with shame,
he goes into exile. In his absence another person, Mit-Othin, “famous
for his juggling tricks . . . was likewise quickened, as though by
inspiration from on high to seize the opportunity of feigning to be
a god” (1.7.2).28 The period of his reign is described as a catastrophe.
He upsets the cultic practices and must finally flee to Finland, where
he is slain. His evil power is so uncanny that even his death does not
immediately put an end to it: “. . . he spread such pestilence that he
seemed almost to leave a filthier record in his death than in his
life” (ibid.).29 After this episode of Mit-Othin one is inclined to overlook the
curious change in style with which Saxo narrates in conclusion the
return of Odin. (This return apparently became possible after
Frigga’s death):
The death of Odin’s wife revived the ancient splendor of his name, and seemed to wipe out the disgrace upon his deity (coniugis fato pristinae claritatis opinione recuperata ac veluti expiata divinitatis infamia), so, returning from exile, he forced all those who had used his absence to assume the honors of divine rank to resign them as usurped; and the gangs of sorcerers that had arisen he scattered like a darkness before the advancing glory of his godhead (superveniente numinis sui fulgore). And he forced them by his power not only to lay down their divinity, but further he quit the country, deeming that they, who tried to foist them¬ selves so iniquitously into the skies, ought to be outcasts from the earth.30
One wonders about this conclusion: It seems that after all Odin
was not “foisting himself into the sky so iniquitously” like the others.
And certainly in the Latin in which Saxo so solemnly wrought his
history the references to Odin’s divinity could not be a slip of the pen.

In Defense of Euhemerus
The only sensible conclusion is that the inner contradiction that
strikes us did not disturb Saxo. And why should this be so amazing?
His “sense of history” was different from ours. It allowed him to
include a story like this one in a book dealing with the history of
kings. Somewhat in anticipation of some final problems it may be
useful to remember that we ourselves had to wait for a nineteenth
century German scholar to be told that the work of a historian is to
find out “wie es eigentlich gewesen ...,” and even then that historian
did not mean it in that emaciated manner in which we as a rule
have heard it quoted. However this may be, the euhemerizations of a
Saxo Grammaticus must not be taken as a cut-and-dried theory of
explaining myth. That systematic notion is of a much later date.
When we speak of Saxo’s euhemerism—chances are that Saxo did not
even know the name of Euhemerus—we should understand it in a
disconcertingly less definable way: as a broad popular and intel¬
lectual movement in which storytelling meant something; it was less
a matter of elaborating on one sweeping causal explanation than a
matter of recording what had already been experienced in previous
narrations. Whatever the merits are of Saxo Grammaticus, the works of Snorri
Sturluson, his younger contemporary, show a much greater artistic
balance. His narratives are also known so much more widely that a
few observations suffice to indicate that he too shows the same fas¬
cinating “inner contradiction” in his euhemerizations. As we know
from the prologue of his Prose Edda, he has the god Thor travel from
ancient Troy in a northern direction, making a deep impression
wherever he passes through. The whole narration gradually fills the
Nordic pantheon, and it is as if Snorri applies a most “orthodox”
euhemerism, making use—like Euhemerus in the case of Uranos—of
striking etymologies (to which all modern scholarship hastens to add
that they are fanciful). Thor, of course, is of royal descent. He is the
son of a king in the area of Troy. His mother was a daughter of King
Priam himself. Priam was called Troan, and Thor’s original name
was Tror. Thor’s character is in no way changed in the euhemerizing
process. At the age of twelve he has attained his brutal strength, kills
his foster parents, to whose care he had been entrusted, and afterward
on his journeys through the world kills beserkers, giants, a huge dragon, and wild beasts left and right. Among his descendants is
Odin, who with his wife Frigg likewise travels north and finally
settles in Sweden. Odin and his companions bring blessings wher¬
ever they go. They were called Aesir which, Snorri assures us, meant

“men of Asia.” “Their travels were attended by such prosperity
that wherever they stayed in a country, that region enjoyed good
harvests and peace, and everyone believed that they caused this, since the native inhabitants had never seen any other people like them for good looks and intelligence.”31
But was all this a matter of make-believe? Was Odin, were the gods,
really human or were they really divine? This question is not raised.
It is our question, and perhaps not a very good one. If we ask Snorri’s
text and insist on an answer, the cumulative thematic evidence points
to mythical structures and not to a theory of historical facts: “Odin,
and also his wife, had the gift of prophecy, and by means of this
magic art he discovered that his name would be famous in the
northern part of the world and honoured above that of all kings.
For this reason he set out on a journey from Turkey.”32
The very beginning of this whole passage is revealing, for Snorri underlines that the place where Troy is situated, “where what we
call Turkey lies,” is “near the centre of the world.”33 It could not be put more mythologically.
There is no one-way explanation of the gods for Snorri; there is
very little resembling the sort of thing that is nowadays called the
“genetic approach.” Instead we find a great concern for relating the
traditions in the midst of which Snorri as a man of his time had to
orient himself. It implied a mythological integration and the means
for it was the narrative. It is well known that the history of Troy was
a constant inspiration for many medieval poetic historians, not least
in the time of Snorri (e.g., the poet Jacob van Maerlant in the Low Countries). And as if linking up Nordic and classical traditions were
not enough, Snorri’s endeavors of integration are prefaced by a sum¬
mary discussion of the biblical creation account and the story of
Adam and Eve. If this manner of presentation is called “pseudo¬ history,” we are jumping to conclusions. This manner of integration
in narrative form is rooted in myth; it is itself truly mythological. It
is easy to see that the euhemerism of a Snorri is a powerful mythologi¬
cal tool. Its characteristic is precisely its built-in ambiguity. It makes
it possible to relate where a later generation could only insist on a
rather dogmatic choice. In other words, there is a reason for the sug¬
gestion I made before: not to be too hasty in separating a “proper”

from an “improper” euhemerism. The two are aspects of the same
power to preserve old themes in a new clash of traditions, each of
which is irrefutably valid. Of course, the question can be raised—and is hard to repress in the study of the Indo-European materials of which we should like to
have so much more than we have: How much was lost of the earlier
tradition in these euhemerizing processes? It is a moot question. It is
somewhat like asking: How much more history is there than the his¬
tory of which we have documents? Yet, I think that we have enough
data to reflect on euhemerism by making a distinction different from
that between “proper” and “improper”: I have in mind the simple distinction between earlier and later euhemerism. The former is the intellectual tradition characterized by narration, integrating existing
traditions and for that reason able to preserve earlier mythological
motifs; it shows a structural kinship with the procedure of Euhem¬
erus himself, even when its negative propensities stand out too (as in
the case of Saxo). These historizations, although the work of artistic individuals, thus show themselves a specific religious structure of
which the popular appeal is noteworthy. They relate to other well
known historizing efforts of the time; I think of the devout descrip¬
tions of the life of the Lord (especially in Christmas songs with mi¬
raculous and almost romantic details)34 and of the Mary-legends. In
fact these historizations and humanizations should be considered a
religious structure worthy of attention as much as “mysticism” and “gnosticism.” Because of its popular appeal and inner relation to widespread devotional forms this type of euhemerism is especially
worthy of attention, much more worthy of attention than would ap¬
pear from such general labels as “pseudo-history.” Narration occurs
as a vehicle of the sacred. Later euhemerism is of an entirely different nature. It has played
such an uncritically accepted role in scholarship that this alone can explain why earlier euhemerism has often been explained on its
terms. Scholars have been so preoccupied with the question of origins
34 I think of some lines in a traditional Dutch song about the Lord’s childhood:
’t At pap uit een pannetje, ’t en maakt hem niet vuil, ’t Viel op de aarde, t’ en had er geen buil. . . . He ate porridge from a bowl, but did not make himself dirty, He fell on the ground, and he did not get a bruise. . . . This type of literature, in the form in which it was given in the Netherlands in the Middle Ages, has been described by M. H. v.d. Zeyde, “De letterkunde in de Lage Landen,” in J. S. Bartstra and W. Banning, Nederland tussen de natien (Amsterdam, 1946), I, 218-225.

of myths that all attention was given to the thematic causes of exist¬
ing euhemeristic documents. It was taken for granted that these
documents were not the real myths—justifiably so, but a genetic ob¬
session too easily leads to a methodological reductionism.
LATER EUHEMERISM
The watershed between early and later euhemerism is the Enlighten¬
ment period.85 To be sure, many eighteenth-century scholars dealing
with religion had as “naive” an idea of history as Saxo and Snorri. It
was not unusual to begin the discussion of man’s religion, as Fon
tenelle (d. 1757) did, with the question if and how the original (bibli¬
cal) revelation was lost in the history of the other nations. Perhaps in
some cases—with scholars taking all the bible as history, just as
Herodotus took Homer—we might think of reverential bows made
in the direction of the clergy. We can think of a man, however, who
did not make a habit of reverential bows, David Hume, and we shall
see in him at the same time a reflection of the old and the new, more
clearly than in anyone else at the time of transition. On the one hand,
there is an acceptance of the naive, pseudohistorical side of the eu¬
hemeristic procedure. On the other hand there is an unmistakable
interest in general theories concerning the causes of the mythical
world. If with some caution we may use the words historization and
humanization for early euhemerism, we are here justified in speaking
of system and reduction. The Natural History of Religion is a small
treatise, not interested in rendering or preserving mythical themes but devoted to a general analysis of religion.
Polytheism is for Hume principally a matter of “uninstructed man¬
kind.” With this idea Hume is very much a child of his age. Speaking
of this uninstructed mankind, incapable as yet of conceiving one
supreme creator, Hume says: “They suppose their deities, however potent and invisible, to be nothing but a species of human creatures,
perhaps raised from among mankind, and retaining all human pas¬
sions and appetites, together with corporeal limbs and organs.”36
Although this euhemerism of the search for general causes is quite
different from early euhemerism, it is of a negative sort that is strange¬
ly reminiscent of the Church Fathers. The negative factor of fear is
35 An interesting general discussion of euhemerism in the Enlightenment period is given by Frank E. Manuel, The Eighteenth Century Confronts the Gods (New York, 1967), chap. iii.

much more effective in the making of gods than hope in Hume’s esti¬
mation. Generally, “men are much oftener thrown on their knees by
the melancholy than by the agreeable passions.”37 The search for sufficient explanations makes one question indeed
inevitable: how precisely can human beings be raised to a super¬
human status? This question was not an urgent one for the early
euhemerists, for somehow they were convinced of the more than human qualities from the outset. It did not even disturb the Church
Fathers very much in their reasonings, for the image of demons for
them was a reality. Hume makes an attempt to answer the question,
for he seems to realize that a general psychological observation about
man’s fear will not do. Fear and the lower passions by themselves are
not creative and could hardly be credited with a good many stories about the gods. It is surprising to see that Hume’s critical mind did not penetrate into these questions more profoundly than it did.
This is what Hume’s euhemerism sounds like:
The deities of the vulgar are so little superior to human creatures, that, where men are affected with strong sentiments of veneration or gratitude for any hero or public benefactor, nothing can be more natural than to convert him into a god, and fill the heavens, after this manner, with con¬ tinual recruits from among mankind. Most of the divinities of the ancient world are supposed to have once been men, and to have been beholden for their apotheosis to the admiration and affection of the people. The real history of their adventures, corrupted by tradition, and elevated by the marvellous, became a plentiful source of fable; especially in passing through the hands of poets, allegorists, and priests, who successively im¬ proved upon the wonder and astonishment of the ignorant multitude.38
It is really surprising that Hume, who took no philosophical idea from the ancient philosophers for granted but reexamined every
single one of them critically, did not judge euhemerism. He simply
accepted it in its negative, “improper” form, embellished only with
some features (allegory, priestly and poetical changes) that were as traditional as this euhemerism itself. The overriding concern for a
general explanation of religious materials as expressed here sets the tone for nineteenth-century scholarship. It is leaning on euhemerism
without critically examining it. Exactly for that reason it distorts it.
By its very nature, this new concern can view euhemerism as nothing
but a theory on the causes of polytheism. Later euhemerism actually did not deal with myth as early euhem

34 Kees W. Bolle
erism did. The typical nineteenth-century students of religion, par¬
ticularly under the influence of the budding science of anthropology,
dealt with religion in general. It has been rightly observed that
Herbert Spencer’s theory on the evolution of religion was flavored by euhemerism39—“later euhemerism” I should like to say. Spencer
wanted to see in ancestor worship the first form of religion. This
theory implied the raise in status of humans upon their death. E. B. Tylor’s theory of animism as the first and basic form of all religion can be understood perfectly as a theory fermented with later euhem¬
erism. Its principal content is the ghosts of the dead. Myths figured only on the fringes of these new scientific undertakings, and it is not
hard to understand that the narration that played the central part in
early euhemerism and had grown on the basis of mythology was a closed book for that scholarship.
Now the same question raised before may be raised again in an in¬
tensified manner: Does not euhemerism leave out elements that were
important in the traditions it pretends to deal with, and does it not
distort those traditions? The answer must be: Later euhemerism
stands guilty in many respects. In terms of a philosophy of culture it
can and perhaps must be argued that destruction of myth is always an
optical illusion. Is not the scientific search for origins by nineteenth
century evolutionists itself a rejuvenated myth of the utmost value?40 Within the small scope of the present topic, however, it must be said that later euhemerism by its very nature was very much more de¬
structive than early euhemerism. We may remember that the Church
Fathers were able to transform gods into demons; they did not have
to deny their existence. By comparison, many missionaries of the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries were thoroughly modern, post
Enlightenment men. They did not have that peculiar power. They
could only say of the gods, of this, that, or the other people in the
wide world, that they did not really exist. Later euhemerism has
indeed been destructive in its reductionism. Endeavors to establish a
worthwhile contact with people whose life was oriented toward those gods have often failed. They only helped in creating a vacuum, the
very vacuum in which many of our academic doings in the study of
man are going on today. Clearly, euhemerism in a Snorri text is not
reductionistic any more than in Euhemerus himself (for all we know).

It has a preserving power that does not show any resemblance to the “break” or “vacuum” associated with later euhemerism in its blanket
explanation of tradition.
CONCLUSIONS
In this paper I have contented myself with a comparison and articu¬
lation of lines of thought evident in euhemerism in the widest sense.
We have found major differences between a euhemerism that made
up stories after the patterns and themes of myths, and a reductionistic theorizing, and have seen the crucial period of transition in the En¬
lightenment. These findings admittedly are of a very general nature,
but it is in order to state some reflective conclusions that bear on the
nature of our dealings with myth. The first conclusion relates to an
indiscriminate depreciation of euhemerism in modern scholarship.
The second has to do with the nature of mythical documents.
Jan de Vries is perhaps the most general depredator of all euhem¬
erism. He speaks of a rationalistic trend in Herodotus, who precisely
for that reason can be regarded as a “precursor of Euhemerus,”41
whereby it must be noted that for de Vries “rationalistic” is always
an adjective of condemnation. Wherever euhemerism occurs, it
smacks of causalistic obsessions for de Vries, in spite of the fact that
for him as a Germanist historizing materials were among his docu¬ ments; he had to deal with euhemerizations in the sense of documents
“transposing” gods into humans. The bugaboo of what I have called
“later euhemerism” clouds the discussion. The romantic historian
Karl Otfried Muller has de Vries’s greatest sympathy. Yet Muller’s
suggestion that some myths can be understood somehow as memory of historical events meets with de Vries’s critical reaction.42 This re¬
action too is not wholly just. After all, there are myths of which we
cannot doubt that historical events codetermined their form. The
foundation myth of the ancient empire of Fu-nan in Southeast Asia
celebrated the marriage of an Indian immigrant and a local princess;
it is impossible to separate the myth from the actual cultural histori¬
cal origin of Fu-nan (and Cambodia).43 Historical causes deserve some
scholarly consideration in some cases, even though they can never
explain the whole myth and all its themes. Above all, one should

not confuse an interest in historical causes of certain myths with the
euhemerizations of earlier centuries that did not “explain” myth but
transferred it into history. De Vries’s aversion to euhemerism obliter¬
ates the distinction. The Church Fathers come to resemble the “philosophes” of the eighteenth century.
This sort of fuzziness is by no means an individual’s affair. It is
given with our scholarly inheritance that is much more interested in
causes, in finding the “original” mythical themes, than in the struc¬
ture of given documents of an age that in comparison cannot be the
supposedly original mythopoeic age. There is a widespread tendency
to speak of euhemerization and degeneration, or at least chances of
decay, in one breath. Even our esteemed friend Littleton, in his ex¬ cellent exposition of Dumezil’s work, gives in to this pattern: “despite
the presence of Christian symbolism and euhemerization, the tri¬
partite ideology persisted.”44 Bayet, whose sympathy for Dumezil’s
work is quite evident, speaks outright of “ce processus de disintegra¬
tion religieuse et d’historisation des mythes.”45 The examples he
gives of historization of myths on the same page, however, are prin¬
cipally inventions of new etiologies for taboos that were no longer
understood. Hence here also, the modern theory of explanation forms
the telescope through which all euhemerism is viewed. I want to
underline that these views cannot be easily refuted, for there obvious¬
ly are phases in Roman history on which we are so abundantly and
diversely documented that the impression of a religious confusion is
hard to avoid. Historizing explanations in the texts seem to be pre¬
sented at random. Bayet adds: “de telles actions ne s’expliqueraient
pas sur un capital mythique assure ni en un milieu ou l’esprit mythique aurait 6t£ vivant.”46 And quite consistent in his views of a
certain process of decay, Bayet continues to say: “And when it occurs
that fundamental Indo-European myths, like those studied by G.
Dumezil, are included in the historical fabric with a national and
ethical value, certainly we have in that case the completion of a de¬ sacralization that began long before then.”47
I am not competent to present an alternative arrangement of his¬
torical details. But a discussion of euhemerism requires an open eye
for more nuances than are perceived in these quotations. It is justi¬
fiable to repeat that euhemerizations are not all explanations of old
44 Littleton, op% cit., p. 18. 45 Bayet, op. cit., p. 48. 46 Ibid. 47 Ibid.
and obscure traditions, but are also new orientations, in narratives
based on myth, when necessitated by the clash of various traditions.
It is not necessary to link such a new orientation per se with decay.
Indeed, the greatest puzzle is hidden in words like “fundamental myths” and “milieux in which there was at one time an ‘esprit
mythique . . . vivant.’ ” This leads to the second concluding reflection. The “genetic ap¬
proach” is valid, of course, in the study of euhemerizing documents, but its limit becomes visible when it disregards the form and struc¬
ture of the document under discussion by focusing only on what may
have been left of the “original” myth. The genetic approach, unless used with the greatest caution and self-criticism, is prone to the same
weaknesses as a bygone evolutionism. The question must be raised:
When does a document stop being an original mythical document
and when does it become a secondary, derived piece of work? Chances
are that neither Snorri nor Saxo could have offered any of their treatises to a nineteenth-century, or for that matter many a twentieth
century, professor, as a doctoral dissertation. And why? Not because
these modern learned men would not accept euhemerism as a meth¬ od, but because they would sense that those old euhemerizations were
too fanciful. Times have changed. We still should not accept the History of the
Danish Kings or the Heimskringla as Ph.D. dissertations. But we
would no longer reject them because of their inadequate euhemeriza¬
tions. They are mythical documents, as such subject to historical
causalities and vicissitudes, but in this respect too like all other mythical documents.
Thus the findings I have submitted to you, general though they
are, include a warning that at least for myself, in my own type of
work, is not misplaced. The very first step in the study of euhemeristic
texts, the step of tracing traditional themes, although exceedingly
important, must not be the only step. Otherwise, we harm the ma¬
terials in a way as if they were reductionistic. The euhemerizing ma¬ terials of a Snorri or a Saxo—and I may add by extending the line:
the Mahabharata—remain mythical. The type of myth they represent
in each case can be formulated in a manner I have tried to indicate.
Even if one wants to limit himself to the discovery of an “original
structure,” one must pay careful attention to the structure of the
euhemerizing text in order to make a legitimate separation between
a specific more original tradition and the new “narrational myth.” We ourselves have reached a place in history of such “secularity”



38 Kees W. Bolle
that we can recognize the mythical character of early euhemerism.
From a certain point of view the present paper is a case study in
secularization. There is a definite break between the myth of eu¬
hemerism and, if you allow me to put it this way, the myth of finding origins characteristic of post-Enlightenment scholarship. It would be
wrong to go on confusing the two. I am far from saying that no effort
is necessary to avoid the confusion. There is, however, a constant and
useful reminder with us in the fact that in all specialized areas of
study the problem of finding an original myth, a “mythe fondamen
tal,” causes difficulties that we cannot ignore. They are not only
philosophical problems, but above all problems for a sound histori¬
ography. From a philosophical point of view it may be true that myth
is given with human existence and that there is no human life with¬
out myth. It may even be defensible to do what Claude Levi-Strauss
so brilliantly proposed: to study all versions of a myth regardless,
and therefore, by way of example, to consider Freud’s version of the
Oedipus myth on a par with the Greek versions.48 Indubitably, it is
a radical solution of the problem of how to transcend evolutionism.
But to me, it seems an inadmissible procedure for the historian of
religions. It is a manner of confusing a mythical story with a reduc
tionism, or one mythical structure with a very different one; in
other words, adding apples and pears.

Comparative Legal Reconstruction
in Germanic
STEPHEN P. SCHWARTZ, University of California, Los Angeles
The Romantic movement in German literature, which began in the
first few decades of the nineteenth century, was responsible for a
new surge of interest in the semilegendary (if not wholly legendary)
world of pre-Christian, agricultural Germany. Essentially and often
avowedly anti-intellectual, it substituted emotion for reason and in¬
tuition for systematic investigation. It attempted to recapture an age that was in almost total opposition to the very real situation of an ununited Germany then undergoing the painful transition into the
urbanized, cosmopolitan world.
The social problems engendered by the rather rapid change from
an agricultural to an industrial economy, plus a massive migration
from rural areas into cities, were viewed as constants of a system re¬ garded ab initio as evil; industrialized, urbanized society. The chronological coincidence of Romanticism with the industrial revo¬ lution had the effect of neither solving nor significantly ameliorating these problems. Rather, it would produce a reaction, more appropri¬ ately a revulsion to them and substitute, for programs that might less¬ en the social consequences of a changed society, a yearning for bygone centuries, when Germany was by definition rural and agricultural,
untouched by the contaminating effects of contemporary society.
Parallel to this would occur a burgeoning nationalism that glorified
things German and rejected things international, such as the ex¬
change of ideas and past and present foreign influence. Since the
present was not good, the past must have been better. If the past had



40 Stephen P. Schwartz
been so much better, why had it not survived? Because of external,
foreign influences upon a Germany politically divided into terri¬
torial states, city-states and cities, and thus divided unable to with¬
stand external forces upon her.
It would fall to Romanticism, when it had discarded the bonds of
creative literature and moved into the arena of social comment, to venerate the past as a means of escaping the present. This veneration of the pagan, heroic Germanic past led to an upsurge of antiquarian
research into such areas as archaeology, ethnography, literature, and
folklore. Prior to this time interest in the Germanic past had been
negligible. We are reminded of the reaction of Frederick the Great
to an edition of the Nibelungenlied by Christoph Heinrich Muller.
Frederick wrote, “. . . dass dieser miserable Plunder kein Schuss Pul
vers wert sei.”1 Although we are admonished that a general’s opinion
of a work of literature may not be especially worthy of serious con¬
sideration, de Vries comments that this evaluation of one of the
cornerstones of Middle High German literature is representative of
the climate of cultural opinion during the age of German Classicism,
and that the Romantics would evaluate such literature differently.
The Age of Romanticism was the time of an energetic search of
monastery cellars, of monastery and cathedral libraries, to unearth the literary remains of medieval Germany. By 1830 (the end of the
Romantic Period), such representative works as the Old High Ger¬
man Hildebrandslied, the Middle High German Kudrun, the Old English Beowulf, and the Old Saxon Heliand were rediscovered.
With passing decades still more manuscripts would come to light, be edited, published, and integrated, where possible, into Germanic
historical, cultural, and literary evolution. From a conscious rejec¬ tion by the intelligentsia of the Germanic past, the pendulum had
swung to the opposite extreme, and the momentum generated by the
Romantic Period would keep the pendulum extended long after
Romanticism had faded into the twilight world of literary history.
Romanticism as a cultural idee fixe would continue to affect future antiquarian scholarship for years to come, and although it would never actually become a bar to such scholarship (the many nineteenthcentury editions of folk literature, medieval literature, and legal
documents bear witness to this), it did produce a certain uniformity of critical consideration of the data under investigation and at¬
tempted to drfiw more substantive conclusions from these data than
1 Cited in Jan de Vries, Heldenlied und Heldensage (Bern, 1961), p. 84.

a purely analytic approach would have done. What I have been in¬
timating in a somewhat roundabout fashion is that there has been
an inherent bias in the critical apparatus used to investigate Ger¬
manic legal antiquities. Bias is a strong word, and I use it with a
certain hesitation in this instance; less argumentative terms such as
“lack of perspective,” “too limited a scope,” or “a tendency to gen¬
eralize” might be more charitable. Yet charity is not warranted in this case; rather, if anything, Occam’s razor.
Let me elaborate this point. The study of Germanic legal antiqui¬
ties was not the only field of scholarship in Europe that received its
impetus in the first few decades of the nineteenth century, nor the
only field that grew and flourished under the banner of Romanti¬ cism. Yet it is probably the only one that still, in large measure, op¬
erates according to preconceived and foreordained ideas that shape
both a scholarly modus operandi and the conclusions that must in¬
evitably be drawn therefrom. It is a contradiction for any field of
scholarly investigation that purports even to the slightest degree to
be operating according to scientific principles, to rely upon emotion
instead of reason and intuition instead of analysis and systematic
investigation (or to rely upon works that do). Unfortunately for the
status of comparative Germanic law such has all too frequently been
the case, and present-day scholarship shows few encouraging signs of change.
As an example, one may contrast the present status of comparative
and historical Indo-European linguistics, whose origin and develop¬
ment chronologically and geographically coincided with the first
studies in the more restricted field of Germanic law, with the present status of Germanic legal antiquities as an area of scholarship. Once
men realized that language was neither of divine origin nor mystical,
but an aspect of human behavior, it could be investigated without
the implied or admitted obligation to confirm traditional prescientific theories. Rather, its goal was, after the collection of data and
their description, analysis, and subsequent comparison with other
data, to set up guidelines, postulates, or rules for the inclusion of
later evidence. This method was open-ended, geared to receive addi¬
tional evidence, and free to modify its structures if new evidence so warranted. It was characterized as an evolutionary process by in¬
creasing thoroughness and rigor and ever more systematic treatment.
In our day Rousseau’s and Herder’s Essays on the Origin of Language
are of little more than antiquarian interest, or, when cited, serve to
point up the futility of an intuitive treatment of language.



42 Stephen P. Schwartz Comparative Legal Reconstruction in Germanic 43
The rejection by linguistics of a Romantic approach to the phe¬ nomenon of language should have served, if not as a warning, at least as an indication, that to retain this Romantic approach to legal antiquities in an age that was becoming more and more scientific in its handling of data, would at best reduce comparative Germanic law to the purview of dilettantes (although commentators would not regard their work as dilettantish), at worst make comparative Ger¬ manic law an impossibility. In this case I am not referring to oc¬ casional excellent works on individual laws themselves or on specific topics, but to the broader subject which is comparative Germanic law. A much-awaited event in the study of Germanic law is a reissue (rather than an updating or reediting) of Jakob Grimm’s Deutsche Rechtsaltertumer, first published in 1828. Benjamin Thorpe’s An¬ cient Laws and Institutes of England, published in 1840, is still con¬ sidered “highly useful.” The major improvement on Thorpe’s work is considered to be Felix Liebermann’s Die Gesetze der Angelsachsen, published in 1898. Yet this work is a collation of laws, with some grammatical commentary, nothing more. In a more recent book con¬ taining several Old English laws and a modern English translation, it is stated that it is an advance in utility over Liebermann’s book because those who cannot read German now have an English transla¬ tion provided.2 Surely the twentieth century deserves more than yet another publication of early legal codes and their translation.3 It cannot be denied that the comparative grammars of IndoEuropean of the nineteenth century are still “highly useful,” but these were, as their description states, comparative, not merely re¬ productions of texts in the various languages. Above all, conclusions were drawn from the comparative evidence. It is reasonable to say that we await the appearance in print of advances in a field, far more than a reprinting of a very early contribution, however highly it may be regarded. The large number of nineteenth-century works ostensi¬ bly dealing with Germanic law which are still considered “highly useful” bear witness to a state of stagnation, or perhaps inertia, and not to the fact that all required research has been done. Real com¬ parison cannot begin until all the data to be compared are in usable form, and at this time they are not.
2 F. N. Attenborough, The Laws of the Earliest English Kings (Cambridge, 1922), p. v. <• 3. The only truly comparative study of the laws of the Germanic peoples is the two-volume work by Garabed Artin Davoud-Oghlou, Histoire de la legislation des Anciens Germains (Berlin, 1845), a work apparently unknown (or if known, inac¬ cessible) to scholars in this field.
I have omitted in this account a statement and/or definition of what constitutes Germanic law. But before this can be answered, a distinction must be made between Germanic law (that is, the law of the Germanic people) and later laws applicable only to individual tribes. A while ago, during an investigation of a more restricted prob¬ lem of Germanic law, I attempted to resolve this distinction, but could not. I began in the usual manner, by consulting the relevant commentaries on the laws themselves, and traditional handbooks, especially those that synthesized the data provided by the laws and provided from this synthesis a picture of what was posited as the customary law of the pre-Volkerwanderung, pre-Christian, ethnographically undifferentiated Germanic people. I was trying to do in law what Germanists do when they compare the earliest written records of the Germanic languages in order to reconstruct ProtoGermanic, an evolutionary offshoot of late Indo-European, prior to dialect differentiation into the various Germanic languages. As a point of departure I intended to see if one could apply the methods of comparative and historical linguistics to law. I wanted to ascertain whether, by comparing similarities and differences in the earliest laws of ethnographically (and linguistically) differentiated tribes, one could reconstruct a Proto-Germanic law: an “Urrecht” on the same basis as an “Ursprache.” Working forward in time, I might then dis¬ cover whether legal differences and similarities paralleled linguistic differentiation. It was at this still theoretical level that new prob¬ lems arose. The first was the result of handbook treatments of com¬ parative legal evidence. Instead of attempting to reconstruct this “Urrecht” (I had thought that nineteenth-century commentators had already done this, and that I would merely have the opportunity to modify, emend, or otherwise offer suggestions), this stage had been omitted. Despite such omission, conclusions had been drawn about social behavior based upon sanctions and prohibitions of the laws themselves. This procedure seemed, in a word, unscientific. I could not imagine that it would be possible to generalize from evidence as fragmentary as laws whole patterns of behavior for a period when no direct written evidence was available. It appeared as if we knew more about the life and customs of the pre-Volkerwanderung Germanic people than we knew about their language. This was and is a funda¬ mental inconsistency. At first I thought that I was on the wrong track; that my ideas about the reconstruction of proto-laws were a vestige of linguistic training and unsuited to the legal data at hand; that conclusions drawn from legal citations were overwhelming, and



Stephen P. Schwartz 45

that as early as 120 years ago Wilda, in Das Strafrecht der Germanen,
had provided as complete a picture as one could wish for. I felt as one
might after reading massive tomes of virtually any given subject; that
the field is closed, and that one had better set about investigating
other areas. In this connection I found that one aspect of comparative Ger¬ manic law is not restricted to the laws themselves and merits com¬
ment because of the place it still has in legal research and in folk
loristic studies. This is something that for want of a better term, and
because no other term is known to me, I call “law in literature.” This is the extraction from works of literature of accounts of the
actions of individuals either in their relationship to other characters
or in response to events, actions that are interpreted as a reflection of
behavior in conformity with or in rejection of some aspect of Ger¬
manic customary law. There is surely no lack of these citations which
may be found in the literature of any of the older Germanic dialects.
The best examples, and those most frequently cited, are found in
Icelandic saga literature. To what extent citations found in rather late medieval literature may be taken as reflections of Germanic law
will remain moot until it has been determined what constitutes Ger¬
manic law and what are later developments of the legal systems of particular cultures. It is tempting to use such literary citations to
build up an impressive case for dogmatic statements about the cus¬
tomary law of the Germanic people, but they should be used with
care at this stage of investigation. Another topic included in studies of Germanic law is worthy of
mention especially for the reason that in this case linguistic methods
are used to provide answers. This is the extraction from texts of the
medieval period of lexical items which, because of their etymological
meaning, are assumed to be survivals of Germanic law, although they
are not found in legal documents. To cite but two examples in pass¬ ing: Gothic unsibjaim (in the dative plural) occurring in Mark 15:28, where the crucifixion is described: jah mip unsibjaim rahnips was, “and he was reckoned among criminals.” Etymologically unsibjaim would mean “with the ‘de-clanned’ ” and has cognates in Old English and Old High German. In the Old High German version of Tatian’s Gospel Harmony, the phrase mit harmu is used. Translated it would mean “harmfully” or “with injury,” yet the Old English cognate phrase mid hearme, occurring in legal texts, is generally translated as “with hue and cry,” because of the uncertainty of the legal practice to which mid hearme applies. The Gothic word was early identified as a
Comparative Legal Reconstruction in Germanic
likely survival of Germanic legal antiquity, although used in a strictly Christian environment and with an obvious change in meaning. To
my knowledge the Old High German citation has escaped notice.
“Harm” has a satisfactory etymology and has cognates in the Slavic
languages, but interestingly is not found in Gothic. Whether this
owes to the limited number of Gothic texts and their predominantly
religious nature, or is a case of legal practices following linguistic
lines, must also remain moot. Like the citations under the heading
“law in literature,” the place in Germanic law of petrified items of
legal vocabulary awaits the determination of what constitutes Ger¬
manic law. Isolated, although numerous, examples of the survival of
legal vocabulary in nonlegal texts should be placed in the framework
of Germanic law and not used to build up its structure.
In the early part of this report I emphasized at some length the
importance of understanding the climate of cultural opinion at the
time when many of the basic works on Germanic law were being
written. At the heart of this opinion was a belief in the innate su¬
periority of the pagan Germanic past, when the Germanic people,
prior to their dissolution into tribes, were untouched by non-German
influences. Of course, one might raise the question whether or not
such a state of affairs actually existed. But this was not a question one
would have raised. It was considered axiomatic by social critics and
others writing under the aegis of Romanticism, and as an axiom needed neither proof nor verification. Indeed, to attempt to verify it
by sound methods of scholarship would have brought the counter¬
charge that these methods were themselves outworn and the product
of non-German cultural influences, and that only emotion and intui¬
tion would enable one to capture the Geist of the Germanic past. To
demonstrate the effect of the Romantic worship of the past, I com¬
ment upon what was considered to be the basis for the origin and
development of law among the Germanic people by nineteenth
century legal scholarship. This was the “peace theory,” and what
was considered its legal by-product, namely outlawry. The “peace
theory” conceived of peace as a positive state and not merely the
absence of war or other hostilities; peace was considered to be a re¬
flection of normal, harmonious, pre-Volkerwanderung, undifferen¬
tiated Germanic society. But for the purposes of legal scholarship, it is not the state of peace that is of primary importance, but rather the
opposite of peace which was peacelessness. According to nineteenth
century handbooks, the essential tenet of the “peace theory” as the
foundation of Germanic law was that a man who broke the peace was



46 Stephen P. Schwartz
subject to violent counterreaction by members of his community.
This assumption is supported by ascribing to the Germanic people a belief that an injury to one man is an injury to all men. This view is
rather sophisticated for Common Germanic times and reflects more
an idealized conception than actual conditions; incidentally, it is
incompatible yvith the next stage of the “peace theory,” which at¬
tempted to equate peacelessness with outlawry.
This equation was facilely made in the past century and is so en¬ trenched that the one major effort to disprove it in the twentieth
century, by Gobel in Felony and Misdemeanor, produced a spate of
unfavorable reviews and, it would seem, no reappraisal.4 But the equation of peacelessness with outlawry can be questioned on
grounds which take into account the assumed social organization of
the period. Even if we accept the social organization assumed by
commentators of both classical antiquity and the Romantic period,
this very type of social organization itself would prevent the equa¬
tion of peacelessness with outlawry. The basis of Germanic organiza¬
tion was the sib, in extended form the clan (that is for the period
when the “peace theory” was assumed to be operative). We find that
the earliest form of punishment for an act of wrongdoing against a
person or persons was not a declaration of peacelessness but a re¬
venge in blood. Clearly, the equation peacelessness = outlawry can¬
not be posited for a time when vengeance and the blood feud were the sole forms of punishment for commission of a major wrong. In
addition, vengeance and feud were by nature personal or familial;
outlawry was by its nature territorial. I think that one is unlikely to have a punishment territorial in nature before the establishment of clearly demarcated territories, a development that no one will posit for pre-Eolkerwunderung Germanic times. To equate peacelessness
with outlawry is an attempt to solve one unknown by means of
another. We also have no evidence to show how the peace of the sib or clan evolved into the peace of the later, greater unit, the tribe thus
yielding the so-called “folk peace.” Those who claim that the post
Volkerwanderung tribe was governed by the “folk peace” must ex¬
plain how the peace of the sib evolved into the “folk peace.” If it did,
the surest way to demonstrate it is by comparative legal reconstruc¬
tion, not by etymological citation, which is the common practice.
There are later peaces that are historically verifiable. These are
the “peace” cor “truce” of God at the end of the tenth century, and
4 Julius Gobel, Jr., Felony and Misdemeanor: A Study in the History of English Criminal Procedure (New York, 1937).
Comparative Legal Reconstruction in Germanic 47
the “king’s peace” of the eleventh century. Was the concept of “folk peace,” postulated for Germanic tribes, a result of these later, his¬
torically attested forms of peace and of nineteenth-ceutury belief in the continuity of the Germanic past, plus wish-fulfillment about
cherished notions of the past? Since we cannot equate peacelessness
with outlawry, nor the peaceless man with the outlaw, how may we
account for the existence in law of both outlawry and the outlaw?
The evidence of the laws themselves provides a partial answer, as do
later literary citations. It appears that outlawry was not a part of the
customary law of the undifferentiated Germanic past. Outlawry as a
punishment for specific offenses occurs in medieval Scandinavian
laws and some laws of Anglo-Saxon England. On the other hand, the
Leges Barbarorum, the laws of the continental West Germanic tribes
of the early Middle Ages, do not treat outlawry explicitly. Since peacelessness = outlawry is assumed for the undifferentiated Ger¬
manic past, its absence in the earliest laws of continental West Ger¬
manic tribes is a major weakness of that theory. Interestingly, the
term “outlaw” itself is restricted to the Scandinavian languages and
to Old English and its descendants, and did not appear in AngloSaxon law until g22 in the Laws of Edward and Guthrum, which
appeared after the Danish invasions; and Guthrum was a Dane. Outlaws, as heroes, are not infrequent in Icelandic saga literature,
but far less frequent numerically in medieval English literature. The
flourishing of outlaw heroes in saga literature, the dearth of outlaw
heroes in English literature for a comparable period, and the absence
of outlawry in the Leges Barbarorum seem to indicate that outlawry
was a secondary phenomenon in law; that it was not to be equated
with peacelessness and was not an aspect of Germanic customary law,
but constituted a later example of statutory law originating in Scan¬
dinavia, which was brought to England during the Danish invasions.
I have included outlawry as a topic in order to demonstrate the
unsystematic methodology used to reconstruct a part of the Ger¬
manic legal past, and to put it into proper perspective. One question
remains unanswered, however, and that is, why was outlawry (after
being equated with peacelessness) seized upon by early commenta¬
tors as being the basis for all Germanic customary law that was to
follow? I suggest that one of the reasons (perhaps the main reason) was the
cultural climate of the early Romantic period and its reflection in
creative literature, literature that would precede in time the works of scholarship dealing with Germanic legal antiquity. To illustrate



48 Stephen P. Schwartz
this point I have selected a Novelle by Ludwig Tieck, entitled Der
Runenberg. The title itself is of course more than suggestive of Ger¬ manic antiquity (especially of the culturally isolated North). The
story concerns a young hunter named Christian, who leaves his village to go into the deepest part of the mountains, . . um sich aus dem Kreise der wiederkehrenden Gewohnlichkeit zu enfernen.”
This is of course mirrored in later social criticism that rejected ur¬
banization. The choice of the name “Christian” is symbolic, as is his
profession, that of hunter. The nineteenth-century Christian re¬
verted to his pagan past as a hunter. Christian in the forest imagines
that the waters are speaking to him, but he cannot understand them.
Loudly, he sings a song about the joys of the hunt, of going through
the forest with hunting-horn resounding, and recalls “die sclione
Jagerzeit.” “Seine Heimat sind die Kliifte,/Alle Baume griiBen ihn” begins another verse. The poem concludes with a statement of the
joys of the chase, the forest, and of the blissful hunter in his new
“Heimat.” His old “Heimat” was, of course, a village. Tieck’s choice of vocabulary, his inclusion of an episode with a screaming man¬
drake root, the use of the name “Christian” for a man who rejects
the oppressive nature of his ordered existence as a gardener’s son to
go off into the unspoiled wilderness, are conscious attempts to resolve the conflict between present and past. I have given but a few exam¬ ples of what upon reading strikes one as being almost hyper
Romantic, until one realizes that the romantic elements in Der
Runenberg are not the exception but the rule. From this literary in¬
terlude I again raise the question why outlawry was selected as the
basis for Germanic law, despite the fact that close analysis militates against this choice.
Observe the legendary outlaw, who leaves home, hearth, and
family, because he has committed an offense against the established
order of his society, to flee into the mountains and forests to evade
capture. There he becomes a changed man, both in the eyes of the
law and by his own actions, and gains new strength by being in com¬
munion with unspoiled nature. Contrast this prototypical outlaw of
medieval literature with Christian of Der Runenberg, who calls his existence “das Ebene” and is more at home in “das Gebirge,” and who flees from his family and village not because of the external pressure
which forced the flight of the outlaw, but is driven by some internal
compulsion to escape the restrictions of early nineteenth-century
society in order to return to the world of the past represented by un¬
touched natural forces rather than the manmade ones, which are

always ordered (his father was a gardener). Christian’s actions are not
rational, as we know the term, they cannot be explained but only
felt. This Romantic approach serves literature quite well, but, ex¬ tended into the realm of scientific analysis and investigation, it
postulated that the desire to escape the present was a manifestation
of a Germanic longing for the unspoiled wilderness. It generalized from the internal pressures of an unstable individual, which pro¬
duced an emotional rejection of his present existence, to a theory
that these pressures and subsequent rejection are analogous to the
sociolegal pressures leading to outlawry; it thus derived later laws
from outlawry and biased forever the question of the origin and
genesis of Germanic law. It would be simplistic to state that one Novelle by a German Ro¬
manticist could produce this effect on later scholarship. Der Runen¬ berg was used merely as an example to show the literary climate of
the times, a climate that stressed nature above man-made things; the unspoiled wilderness above the cosmopolitan city (or even village);
rejection of society rather than attempts to modify it; and a feeling
that somehow Germanic civilization had been corrupted by external
non-German pressures. To this would be added the almost uni¬
versal belief in the outlaw as a romantic figure, who had been made
to suffer unjustly for something that was beyond his control, but
which, nevertheless, was also a constant of his society. Outlawry, as
the basis for Germanic law, may now tentatively be rejected and
systematic investigation begun.
But where? Classically we should begin with the earliest written
laws of the Germanic tribes and/or kingdoms which are extant.
And it is at this point that our first stumbling block appears. Calvert
Watkins has previously demonstrated the inherent archaism and
conservatism of legal language, and its value in both linguistic and
cultural research. That this is true for many of the Indo-European
languages is not in doubt. But for the Germanic languages the earli¬ est laws are so “archaic” that they are not written in a Germanic language at all, but in Latin, and it would seem not very good Latin
at that. To be sure, there are German words in most of the earliest laws, in instances where there is no equivalent in Roman law, as in
the case of minor public officials, or for certain offenses. These latter
are often given in both the Latin and the vernacular form. There
are also a certain number of Latinized vernacular words. Writing,
except for Runic characters and the Gothic alphabet, reached the
Germanic peoples rather late. The dependence of Germanists upon



5° Stephen P. Schwartz
works of classical antiquity for the earliest recorded information about their subject is testimony to this. This, coupled with the cul¬
tural advancement of Greece and Rome, meant that our earliest
information took the form of citations of items of material culture
absent in the classical world, personal and divine names, and, most importantly for our purposes, social behavior and quasi-legal pro¬
scription when they differed from those of Greece or Rome. To this
void of information may be added the earliest laws themselves. We
must determine to what extent Germanic law has been retained,
despite being written in a foreign language, and to what extent these
recorded laws of Germanic tribes are influenced by Roman law in
addition to the Latin language. That is, to what extent did the
medium determine the message?
We are a little more fortunate in Anglo-Saxon law, most of which is recorded in Old English and/or Latin, but this material is of
later date and reflects a society far more changed, and in far greater
cultural isolation than those tribes that remained on the continent.
After the tenth century it is also subject to Scandinavian influence.
In addition we must assume that the adoption of Christianity by the Germanic peoples also wrought changes in the laws. This is easiest
to see in laws pertaining to members of the clergy, punishments for breaking into a church, working on religious holidays, and so on.
But we cannot assume that Christian influence is reflected in the
laws only when some aspect of Christianity is referred to. Drawing
a parallel from early Germanic vernacular literature, it is quite pos¬
sible to have Christian influence in such areas as choice of theme, of vocabulary, of treatment of events, and generally of Weltanschauung,
although direct references to Christianity do not appear. Students
of early Germanic vernacular literature are aware of the many long controversies about whether or not certain aspects of a given work of
literature are of pagan origin, show Christian influence, were re¬
written to conform to the new religion, and the like.
Still, references in a law to some aspect of Christianity are late
developments. But this of course does not solve the problem, for references to the clergy or to Christianity itself may have been either
added to the existing pre-Christian part of the law or merely trans¬
ferred to those portions dealing with pagan religious practices. One thing may be said with certainty, however: by the time we have laws
of a Germanic'ipeople written in Latin, the society affected by these laws had undergone great changes, not only in relation to undifferen¬
tiated Germanic times, but also to early tribal organization, and
W
Comparative Legal Reconstruction in Germanic 51
was evolving or had already evolved into a territorial state.
Extracting “the Germanic component” from laws written in Latin
means more than collecting the vernacular words found therein. One
possible means is to follow the lead of Grimm in contrasting such items as paired Latin expressions with their attested equivalents in
a Germanic language.5 Lie found some instances where a translation
of the Latin yielded an alliterating sequence of two nominal or
verbal forms. This does not mean that, to determine the entire Ger¬
manic component, all one has to do is translate the laws and compare
them to laws in a vernacular language. I have done this as a mechani¬
cal exercise and found many of the results unrewarding. Alliteration
as a stylistic device is the characteristic of early Germanic poetry, and handbooks on Germanic law list numerous examples of alliterat¬
ing pairs of nominal and verbal forms that occur in the laws. Allit¬
eration was most likely begun as a mnemonic device of a preliterate
people, and its original purpose was functional or pragmatic rather
than stylistic or ornamental. When the society became literate, allit¬
eration became formulaic rather than functional. With the passage
of time the formulaic nature of alliteration predominated and ob¬
scured the original meaning of those terms that alliterated. So much
so, that although there is an abundance of alliterating forms in the
laws, we often cannot determine what is meant. Thus the mere col¬
lection of alliteration proves nothing more than the retention (Grimm
calls them eingewurzelt in the laws) in legal documents of a tradi¬
tional Germanic literary device whose origins lay in a desire to bring
speedy recall to memory. If it is doubted that survivals of alliteration
are formulaic rather than functional, or ornamental rather than
descriptive, consider what alliteration is doing in legal prose at all.
It is a testimony to the conservatism of legal codices and to the likely
connection between poetry and oral legal tradition, but may not bear
testimony to contemporary customs, behavior, or proscriptions.
In this connection I would like to propose that the traditional
distinction between customary law and statutory law be abandoned as providing no useful parameters for purposes of research. Cus¬
tomary law, common law, or folk law (it goes by all these designa¬
tions) we take to be the unwritten expression of popular custom and
belief (that is, “consensus law”) in contrast with statutory law, which
is “learned law” found in statutes and imposed. In perpetuating this
distinction in Germanic law we are perpetuating an essential con

5* Stephen P. Schwartz
tradiction, for the earliest written laws of a Germanic people are still designated as “Volksrechte,” that is, the setting down in print of
the popular beliefs and customs of the people to whom they applied.
To continue to use the term “Volksrechte” implies that at a later
period other laws would be imposed upon people who got along
very well with laws arrived at by consensus, if not by consent. That other, later laws were set down cannot be denied, but the process
of evolution from clan to tribe to nation brings with it the concom¬ itant change in law to cope with a new social situation. The ex¬ pansion, revision, or imposition of new laws does not magically
create statutory law. I feel that this distinction between customary
law and statutory law should be given up, except in instances where
a conflict of laws can be attested or surmised. The distinction just
mentioned is illusory: as a society becomes more complex, there is
an ever greater specialization of function. In the legal sphere this means that ever fewer members of that society have a direct say in
the formulation of laws affecting them. Furthermore, there is enough
secondary literature (albeit disputed) to prove that specialization of function in the form of the law-speaker (in Old Icelandic literature) existed prior to the period of written statutory law.
Up to this point I have stated in what ways I feel that studies of
Germanic law have been based upon erroneous premises and have
proceeded intuitively rather than systematically, and above all have
treated fragments of the legal past, rather than the whole. I recom¬
mend abandoning such an approach in favor of using the methodol¬
ogy of comparative and historical linguistics (the “genetic” approach)
to reconstruct a proto-law in the same manner (but obviously with
the same limitations and difficulties) that a protolanguage is recon¬
structed. I am aware of the fact that the “genetic” approach to legal
evolution and reconstruction is open to some question, but this owes
in large measure to a lack of appreciation of the nature of the in¬
formation desired. What we are after is not a miscellaneous grabbag of proto-words, nor the Geist, but a series of statements about
belief, prohibitions, and social behavior, to mention but a few. The
only way to see if reconstruction of a proto-law will work is to begin
to set it up. To get the best possible picture one must use all the
data at hand. This is a difficulty, because of the lack of adequate,
up-to-date editions of the relevant laws. This is a time-consuming,
but not insurmountable difficulty, except in terms of accessibility in
university and other libraries. A second difficulty is the question of
language. Unlike the laws of many of the individual Indo-European
Comparative Legal Reconstruction in Germanic 53
languages, Germanic law is found written in many languages such as Latin, Old English, Old Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Old
Frisian, Old Low Franconian, Old High German, Middle Low Ger¬
man, Middle High German, and Norman French. To attempt to
reconstruct this proto-law, one must have a knowledge of these lan¬
guages. But this in itself is not enough, else it might have been tried
before. I recommend a new approach. First, collect all laws of the Ger¬
manic peoples, with a tentative cut-off date at the time of the
Sachsenspiegel around 1230. The laws should then be carefully trans¬
lated into one uniform language and broken down in a form suitable
for computerized analysis, for the purposes of determining similar¬
ities and differences.6 Of course the search for similarities and differ¬
ences could be done without mechanical assistance, but it would be
a tremendous advantage to subsequent interpretation. The data
could be further augmented by the addition of material from the
area of “law in literature,” if this appears warranted. The question
of time-depth will have to be resolved, but it can be handled in the
same way that an Indo-Europeanist handles the time-depth question
in comparing Hittite with Old Prussian and Lithuanian. Computer¬
ized analysis might provide an answer to the question of whether legal evolution follows ethnographic and linguistic lines. This was
the question that got me started in legal antiquities and the ques¬
tion that led me to begin work in reconstructing something I call
a proto-law. The result will determine the validity of this idea. Re¬
construction should not cease because of the bias induced by Roman¬ ticism, but should proceed in the same manner as does paleontology,
anthropology, linguistics, and philology. If this approach does not work, then so be it. It will at least have had the merit of being tried.

The Indo-European Component in Germanic Religion
EDGAR POLOME, University of Texas
Any scientific study and interpretation of ancient religion is closely
dependent on the available source material. In the study of Ger¬
manic religion, the value and reliability of the sources appear to be
a particularly important problem, since our information is scanty
and desultory. What is at our disposal consists, indeed, mainly of
circumstantial evidence and external testimony; we do not have any
specific original ritual text, or any genuine Germanic writing wit¬
nessing the relationship between man and god in ancient times, and
all we claim to know is what we can infer from the scattered rem¬
nants of Germanic religious life according to the prevailing views
of our time, combined with our personal prejudices. This rather
discouraging situation had led Vilhelm Gronbech half a century
ago to concentrate his attention on the perception of the genuinely
Germanic spiritual, intellectual, and cultural aspects of Old Ger¬
manic individual and social life, thus paving the way for a better
insight into Germanic Lebensgefiihl and basic religious concepts.
His identification of some ethical concepts such as honor with a kind
of magical vital force introduced the concept of a rather strict creed
of predestination into the Old Germanic world, which led to far¬
fetched conclusions about the so-called germanischer Schicksalglaube.
In recent years, the idea that man shapes his gods according to his
own being has received repeated confirmation in the study of exotic
cultures; various efforts to apply this new knowledge to Germanic
religion have led to careful reexamination of the scanty reliable evi

dence available in this field. But instead of carrying out minute his¬
torical research on the detailed development of the individual deities
by patching up a ragged image composed of aimless bits of evi¬
dence, the new trends focused their attention on pattern and struc¬
ture in Germanic religion, mainly according to three different
approaches: (a) the Vienna school of anthropology; (b) the typologi¬
cal analysis of Mircea Eliade, based on the concept of archetypes
coined by C. G. Jung and applied to religious studies by Karl Kerenyi
and Erich Neumann; (c) the sociological approach, mainly developed in the works of Georges Dumezil.
The basic idea of the Vienna school is that religious patterns de¬
velop in conformity with levels of culture. An illustration of this
view is given by Alois Closs in his contribution “Die Religion des
Semnonenstammes” to the volume Die Indogermanen- und Germanenfrage,1 in which he analyzes the ritual implied in the human sacrifice described by Tacitus in chapter 39 of his Germania, and sup¬ plies rich comparative material to elucidate its motivation. Similarly, in his study “Das Versenkungsopfer,” published in the volume Kul
tur und Sprache,2 numerous parallels to the Germanic sacrifice by im¬ mersion occurring, for example, at the end of the Nerthus ritual (Tacitus, Germania, chap. 40), are listed in correlation with their
Indo-European and general cultural background. A more compre¬
hensive survey of his views is given by Closs in his contribution “Die
Religion der Germanen in ethnologischer Sicht” to the second vol¬
ume of Christus und die Religionen der Erde,3 where he explains
the main phenomena and trends of development in Germanic re¬ ligion in connection with his views on Germanic ethnogenesis on the
basis of Wilhelm Schmidt’s somewhat subjective theories on original
monotheism and on the prehistory of Indo-European tribes. His conclusion is typical of the Vienna school approach:
Die mannigfachen Keime zur spateren intensiven Ausbildung von Stammesreligionen schon in der urgermanischen Anfangszeit lassen sich vielmehr in Erwagung der prahistorischen Verhaltnisse am Ende der Steinzeit am besten als Ergebnis einer Volkermischung verstehen, wobei ins Dunkel gehiillt ist, wodurch aus verschiedenen Bestandteilen, alteuropaischen wie eurasiatischen, diese sehr wohl mit naheren Beziehungen zur turanischen Gruppe, ein neues Volk wurde.

Indo-European Component in Germanic Religion
zu dieser ersten Volkwerdung ist nicht scheinbar, wohl aber zeigt sich spater, im Zuge der Zusammenballung der Stamme zu grosseren Kultverbanden, bereits im Zeitalter der Entstehung von Weltreligionen im ostindogermanischen und vorderasiatisch mediterranen Volkerkreise, bei den Suebogermanen ein amphiktyonischer Typ, der in einer Weise, wie dies weder bei den griechischen noch bei den polynesischen Amphiktyonien, wohl aber bei der latinischen . . . der Fall ist, in der Art der Zusammenkiinfte, wie ein Haften an urtiimlicher Verwandtschaft zwischen den Stammen, wie eine Erinnerung an eine friihere Zusammengehorigkeit anmutet.4
Reformulated here, rather subjectively, in ethnological jargon are
actually not very original views: (a) the theory of H. Giintert of the
mixture of two populations—the “megalithic” pre-Indo-European
agriculturalists and the Indo-European invaders—as the origin of
the Germanic people; (b) the intimation of a parallelism between
Germanic and Italic religious traditions.
Mircea Eliade’s stress on patterns of rituals for archetypal deities
is reflected in the study on the Germanic mother goddess which I
published more than a decade ago.5 In this article I tried essentially
to reject the common interpretation of the Nerthus ritual as symbolic
of a hierogamy between the skygod and the earth goddess, since there
was no overt trace of a masculine element playing the part of the
former. I indicated that, at an older stage, the archetypal Terra mater
did not imply the coexistence of the phallic elements that appear in
a later development; agriculture was still a typically feminine activ¬
ity in the days of Tacitus, and only with its masculinization do the
agrarian gods Ing and Freyr appear and does Nerthus change into
the male god Njordr. Therefore, I preferred to interpret the Nerthus
ritual as the celebration of a cosmic event—the advent of spring
along the lines described by M. Eliade:6
For a moment, the life of the whole human group is concentrated into a tree or some effigy of vegetation, some symbol intended to represent and consecrate the thing that is happening to the universe: spring. . . . The presence of nature is indicated by a single object (or symbol). It is no pantheist adoration of nature or sense of being at one with it, but a feel¬ ing induced by the presence of the symbol (branch, tree or whatever it may be), and stimulated by the performing of the rite (processions, con

tests, fights, and the rest). The ceremonial is based on a comprehensive notion of the sacredness of all living force as expressed at every level of life, growing, wearing itself out and being regularly regenerated. This “bio-cosmic sacredness” is personified in many different forms, changing, it would seem to suit mood or circumstance. . . . What remains, what is basic and lasting, is the “power” of vegetation, which can be felt and manipulated equally well in a branch, an effigy or a mythological figure.
The symbol involved in the Nerthus ritual, which indicated to the
priest the presence of the “power” of vegetation in its mobile shrine,
was presumably the appearance of a definite plant or flower. This
would complete the pattern “goddess-vegetation-sacred animalspriests” so characteristic of the Great Goddess,7 since the Germanic
Earth-Mother would then be associated with a vegetal symbol as well
as with the heifers drawing her chariot and the priest and slaves at¬
tending her. The celebration of the ritual involves a circumambulatio
agrorum, to effect the irradiating of her power; during this cere¬
monial procession there is general peace and all weapons are locked
up; there is joy everywhere (laeti tunc dies), and presumably the
community as a whole participates in the orgiastic frenzy that sets
flowing the sacred energy of life. But to regenerate the sacred force
of the goddess exhausted by irradiation, it is necessary to ritually
restore it to her by immersion and compensatory human sacrifice.
Accordingly, “le rituel de Nerthus apparait . . . comrne un r£actuali
sation symbolique du renouveau, destined a promouvoir la fertility agricole par une procession solennelle et a r^generer la force vitale
de la Terre M£re, symboliquement par l’immersion de son embteme et concretement par la noyade des officiants.”8
Thus, by applying Eliade’s approach, I have ultimately reinter¬
preted a Germanic ritual as the enactment of a scenario sui generis,
based on patterns whose variations abound in the most diverse cul¬
tures. This, however, excludes any close relationship with the cult
of Cybele or any other mother goddess in the Western world.
Quite different is the situation with Dumezil’s approach based on
the functional tripartition of social life: (1) sovereignty, with its
double aspect—juridical and magical; (2) physical force, mainly for
military purposes; (3) fecundity, with its correlates: prosperity, health,
long life, peace, and so on. Here Nerthus appears clearly as the rep¬
resentative of the third function in the interpretatio Romana of
Tacitus, besid^ Mercurius and Mars as correspondents to Odin and
7 Ibid., p. 230; French ed., p. 244. 8 Polome, op. cit., p. 199.
Indo-European Component in Germanic Religion
Tyr on the level of the first function,9 and Hercules—and partly also Jupiter, on account of lightning—as correspondent to Thor on the
level of the second function. In the Scandinavian world, the position
of Nerthus, whose name *nerpuz literally means ‘power,’ has been taken over by Freyr because she has been reshaped into the male god
Njordr with a shift in function in the Eddie mythology. The applica¬
tion of the Dumezilian tripartite system to the Germanic pantheon has, however, given rise to many objections. It has been pointed out
that there were considerable differences in the social structure of the Germanic world, depending on which area of it was being consid¬
ered: along the borders of the Roman Empire an undoubtedly more
bellicose type of society prevailed, characterized by the totalitarian
system of agriculture described by Caesar (De Bello Gallico 6.22) and the predominance of the gods of the first and second function,
whereas on the shores of the Baltic a much more peaceful and stable
society could safely practice a strictly distributive economy and give
special reverence to the gods of the third function like the Ingaevones,
constituting the amphictyony of Nerthus, or the Naharvali. While
instability and insecurity tend to favor a kind of heroic unanimity
with focus on the cult of first- and second-function gods, a completely
different mood prevails when conditions are less fluid and property
can be safely transferred from generation to generation. This duality
of attitude depending on the state of the community fits perfectly
into the Dumezilian system, as he has shown eloquently in his Mitra
Varuna.10 Even those who, like R. Derolez, utterly reject Dum6zil’s
8 Whereas the identification of Mercurius with *WoSanaz owes to a rather sec¬ ondary parallelism between the functions of Mercurius as conductor of the souls and the association of *WoSanaz with the dead warriors (Old Norse einherjar), the link between Mars and Tyr rests on the Germanic concept of war as a judg¬ ment by arms (ON vapnadomr), which puts it into the domain of the juridical functions of Tyr, whose association with the judicial and legislative assembly (ON ping) is also evidenced by the votive inscriptions to Mars Thincsus. While the identification of *WoSanaz with Mercurius seems rather constant, as shown by inscriptions like Mercurius Rex (Nijmegen) and the sacrifice of prisoners of war to him by hanging them with a noose on trees, the sacrifice of horses to Mars, e.g., after the victory of the Hermunduri over the Chatti (a.d. 58), points rather to a specifically second-function god in the case of the Germanic corre¬ spondent to Mars. The text of chapter g of Tacitus’ Germania, “Deorum maxime Mercurium colunt, cui certis diebus humanis quoque hostiis litare fas habent. Herculem et Martem concessis animalibus placant; pars Sueborum et Isidi sacrificat,” is particularly significant in this regard, since it closely associates Mars with Hercules, while mentioning the third-function cult of "Isis” among the Suebians immediately thereafter. 10 (2d ed.; Paris, 1948), pp. 152-159; cf. also my article "La religion germanique primitive, reflet d’une structure sociale,” Le Flambeau 37:452-463 (1954).



6o Edgar Polome
views must admit that the structure of Germanic society agreed by and large with his postulated social pattern:
At the head of every tribe was a king or a group of heads of smaller tribal units, but in the latter case, a suitable commander was chosen among them in time of war. Various religious elements appeared in the direc¬ tion of the state: the king was “sacred,” the priests kept order and peace in the “thing” assemblies and punished all crimes. . . . Political power belonged in principle to the “thing”; all important decisions were taken in those assemblies, in which all free men appeared in arms, but among these free men a smaller group of influential families controlled in fact the direction of public affairs, tending to make this situation permanent by isolating themselves from the lower classes and claiming they were born noblemen. Below the free men were the half-free taxpayers, and on the lowest level, the slaves. . . .n
It is obvious that Dumezil’s approach involves a number of pos¬
tulates. It implies (i) that the same event can be present as a myth
in one group and as history in another, for example, when Dumdzil
compares the struggle and reconciliation between the Aesir and the
Vanir with the Sabine War in ancient Rome as the reflex of an Indo
European mythologem about the shift to peaceful development in a
warlike Indo-European people through a symbiosis with prosperous
opponents; (2) that the tripartite system survives changes in society;
only the functional attributes of the gods, not their names and spe¬
cific personalities, are of vital importance. Accordingly, for Dumezil,
Germanic religion is the religion of the Indo-Europeans in its trans¬
formation by the Germanic tribes. This assumption is utterly rejected
by Karl Helm12 who claims: “Die germanische Religion ist zum
kleinsten Teil indogermanische Religion; ihre Grundlage ist die
Religion des in den spater germanischen Landern beheimateten und hier vielleicht seit Urzeiten, d.h. schon vor der Bildung des Indo
germanentums siedelnden volkischen Subtrates, wie sie sich im Laufe
der Jahrhunderte unter den verschiedensten Einfliissen herausgebildet hat.”13 He accordingly emphasizes “Vanic” religion as the pre
Germanic religion of the neolithic farmers and considers, for
example, the spread of the cult of Odin as a late development.14 But
if the Vanir and Aesir reflect the two constituents of the Germanic
people in prehistoric times—the neolithic farmers and the Indo

European invaders—15 the structure of society in those days as as¬ sumed on archaeological grounds perfectly fits the Indo-European pattern;16 moreover, the story of their struggle as compared with simi¬ lar situations after the foundation of Rome reflects a general pattern of conflict and compromise which conforms to Indo-European tra¬
dition. What actually opposes Helm and Dumezil is their basic attitude
to the problem of Germanic religion: Helm wants to evaluate the
scanty facts from a strictly historical point of view and to reach his conclusions about the individual gods by inductive reasoning; Dumezil has recognized a definite structure as basic to and specific of Indo-European society and, by comparison of the various attested
systems, tries to back up his deductions on the survival of the original
tripartition in the most disparate traditions of the Indo-European
peoples. As Werner Betz17 indicates: “Beide Wege sind notwendig.
Der Germanist wird versuchen, die Gefahren beider zu vermeiden:
geschichtsloses Strukturieren oder historisierendes Auflosen in au
seinanderfallende Details—und dafiir sich bemiihen, die Vorteile beider fruchtbar zu machen: Herausarbeiten der grossen Zusammen
hange und Dberpriifung des Beschlossenen am geschichtlichen Be
zeugten.” Actually, when we want to evaluate the Indo-European component
in Germanic religion we have to determine its varying impact on the
available material and the precise type of correspondence it reflects.18
Too often links have been assumed in the past on the basis of sheer
etymological speculations: if one prefers to connect Sanskrit asurah,
‘lord,’ with Hittite hassus, ‘king,’ and Germanic *ansuz, ‘Ase,’ instead
of preserving the traditional interpretation of asurah. as a derivation
of *nsu- (reflected by asuh, ‘vital strength’), meaning ‘gesteigerte
Lebenskraft, orenda,’ as Giintert puts it,16 he will do so only with reference to the specific functions of the Germanic Aesir and the
original Indo-Iranian Asuras as “sovereign gods,” especially Odin

of some correspondences. Take, for instance, the myth of Njordr’s marriage. It is undoubtedly true, as Dumdzil points out, that “tout

tivement li^ a la nature du dieu”;24 yet if these motifs have not been
gathered at random, they are nevertheless a scenario sui generis in
the Germanic tradition. It requires, indeed, a stretch of the imagina¬ tion to compare the svayamvara as described, for example, in the Nala episode of the Mahdbharata, with the kind of marriage lottery
to which Skadi agrees; besides, the criterion of choice is without any
actual parallel in Indo-European tradition.25 The importance of
footmarks in prehistoric symbolism points rather to the prevailing
local association with fertility gods. As for the obscene interlude with
the goat, devised by Loki to make Skadi laugh, again no direct par¬
allel can be adduced, although obscene gestures designed to provoke
laughter are common stock among the tales associated with fertility
gods. Thus, if a definite scenario fits into the pattern of the social
functions of a Germanic god, it does not imply pre-Germanic origins
and can very well be a purely Germanic development motivated by
local conditions.
In this respect, it might be advisable to reexamine Dumezil’s dis¬ cussion of one of the principal Germanic myths, the myth of Baldr.
In a fresco of wide range, he depicts this mythological drama as the
“keystone of world history.”26 Whereas the blind, otherwise unknown
Hodr appears as the instrument of blind fate, the wise and generous
Baldr who fathered the god of conciliation but whose decisions re¬
mained without effect, is the Scandinavian reflex of the minor sov¬
ereign gods Aryaman and Bhaga, whose epical transposition Dumezil
recognizes, with Wikander, in Vidura and Dhjtarastra in the Mahabharata.27 Loki uses Hodr to eliminate Baldr in a fatal game that
24 La Saga de Hadingus, p. 35. 25 The resemblance to the Sukanyd episode in the Mahdbharata remains very superficial, in spite of Dumezil’s efforts to correlate the stories (cf. Naissance d’archanges [Paris, 1945], pp. 159-162, 177-180). 26 Les dieux des Germains, p. 95. For Dumfeil’s discussion of the Baldr myth, cf. Loki (Paris, 1948), pp. 133-158, German ed. (Darmstadt, 1959), pp. 96-115; Les dieux des Germains, pp. 93-105, with the comments of de Vries in PBB(T) 81: 218-220 (1959). 27 The original contribution of Stig Wikander, “Pandava-sagan och Mahabharatas mystika forutsattningar,” published in Roll 6:27-39 (1947), was translated by Dumezil with extensive comments in Jupiter Mars Quirinus IV (Paris, 1948), pp. 37-85. Among the numerous further elaborations of the thesis that the Indian epic reflects, in a literary transposition, a set of myths relative to the Vedic and pre-Vedic gods, the article of Dumezil, “La transposition des dieux souverains mineurs en li&os dans le Mahdbharata" (II] 3:1-16 [1959]), is especially relevant to the problem of Baldr, though he merely refers in footnote 39 (p. 15) to the figures of Baldr and Hodr as the ultimate Germanic outcome of the Indo-European minor sovereign gods.

spells disaster for the present world, since it opens a long dark age
that ends in an ultimate battle between the forces of Evil and the
gods, after which a new, regenerated world will arise. The parallelism
with the Mahabharata episode consists mainly in the following facts: (1) an apparently dangerless game compels Yudhisthira to exile on
account of his partner’s cheating; (2) after years of exile during which
the evildoer Duryodhana prevails, Yudhisthira and his brothers re¬
turn to claim their rights; the murderous battle of Kuruksetra marks
the victory of Good over Evil, after which Vidura and Dhrtarastra,
who did not take part in the fight, assume new functions in the rec¬
onciled society of heroes. Apart from the fact that, in both instances,
a fateful game involving a blind partner is the decisive event in the
drama, the two stories are quite different: Hodr in Snorri’s tale is a
mere instrument of the schemer Loki, whereas the blind Dhrtarastra is more directly implicated, since he consented to the cheating
through weakness and was aware of the consequences for Yudhi¬ sthira. Besides, the link of the death of Baldr with Ragnardk is ex¬ tremely tenuous; before drawing such far-reaching conclusions it
would be advisable to reexamine the whole Germanic tradition. It
is indeed obvious that Loki, who is the keystone of Dumdzil’s eschato¬
logical interpretation of the episode, does not at all play the part that
Snorri assigns to him. In the Eddie lay of “Baldr’s Dreams,” the seeress answers Odin’s question about the name of Baldr’s murderer as follows:
Hodr will the hero hitherward send. He will Baldr slay, the blameless god, and end the life of Odin’s son,28
a statement that the “Prophecy of the Seeress” (Vgluspd, sts. 31-32) confirms:
I saw for Baldr, the blessed god, Ygg’s dearest son, what doom is hidden: green and glossy there grew aloft, the trees among, the mistletoe.
The slender-seeming sapling became a fell weapon when flung by Hodr but Baldr’s brother was born full soon: but one night old slew him Odin’s son.20

This avenger is Vali, the son of the giantess Rind and Odin, who had forced her by magic spells to bear him this son. In the lay of
“Baldr’s Dreams” as well as in the “Prophecy of the Seeress, this
Vali refuses to wash his hands and to comb his hair so long as Hodr
has not paid with his life for the evil deed. There is no question of punishing Loki, and in the “Prophecy of the Seeress” the stanza
about the atonement for Baldr’s death ends with a reference to
Frigg’s lament over the “fateful deed.” Since Baldr’s death appears
to be the prelude to world destruction, the immediately following
question applies to the fettering of Loki. The latter’s breaking loose
is another prelude to Ragnarok, as is pointed out in the last stanza
of “Baldr’s Dreams”: “Loki is loose from his bonds and the day will
come of the doom of the gods.”80 The motif of Loki’s fettering is
accordingly only secondarily linked with Baldr’s myth, and that this
is also true of the whole intervention of Loki appears from the tale of Saxo Grammaticus, whose euhemeristic account reads as follows:
Hotherus—i.e., Hodr—comes from Sweden; he is the son of Hodbroddus. Nanna, the daughter of the Norse king Gevarus, falls in love with him, but Balderus, the son of Othinus, after seeing her at her bath, is madly in love with her, and decides to get rid of Hotherus. The latter is warned by three nymphs, who also tell him that Balderus is half divine. When Hotherus sues for Nanna’s hand, Gevarus flatly refuses to agree
30 Hollander, op. cit., p. 119. There is no explicit mention of Loki s fettering in the Eddie sources as being specifically his punishment for participating in the murder of Baldr. There is no doubt, however, that Loki was somehow involved in it, since he brags about his being responsible for the absence of Baldr at the gathering of the gods in Aegir’s hall (Lokasenna, st. 28):
Be mindful, Frigg, what further I tell of wicked works of mine: my rede wrought it that rides nevermore hitherward Baldr to hall.
The phrase ec pvi reed has, indeed, to be translated ‘it is my fault’ (ich inn daran schuld) according to H. Gering, Kommentar zu den Liedern der Edda [Halle, 1927], I, 291. E. Mogk thought that this applied to Loki’s preventing Baldr from re¬ turning from Hell by refusing to bewail him under the shape of Thokk, but this is improbable (cf. F. R. Schroder, Germanentum und Hellenismus [Heidel¬ berg, 1926], pp. 109-110; J. de Vries, The Problem of Loki, FFC 110 [Helsinki, 1933], pp. 163-171). This passage alludes rather to Loki’s having been the radbani of Baldr, i.e., ‘the contriver’ of his murder, but he may very well have done this merely by supplying Hodr with the only weapon that could harm Baldr, the mistletoe: this would be in keeping with his function as trickstei and paiallel with his forging the only weapon that can slay the rooster ViSofnir on MfmameiS (cf. FjQlsvinnsmal, st. 26)—a sword that is called Lcevateinn, literally the guileful twig.’ Maybe his trick in the case of the mistilteinn was to harden it into a lethal weapon? Cf. the connection A. B. Rooth (Loki in Scandinavian Mythology [Lund, 1961], pp. 136-139) tries to establish with the “hardened holly” as a weapon in West European medieval tradition.

to this marriage, because he is afraid of Balderus who is invulnerable. He advises Hotherus to try to obtain a sword from the forest-demon Mimingus, with which he would be able to strike Balderus mortally. Hothe¬ rus succeeds in securing the sword and a miraculous ring to boot, which causes the riches of its owner to increase constantly. After Hotherus has vanquished a certain Gelderus, while Nanna has rejected Balderus under the pretence that a marriage between a demigod and a mortal is unadvisable, both suitors wage a ruthless fight, in which the gods intervene. Balderus has to flee and Hotherus marries Nanna. Soon, however, Balder¬ us attacks his land and Hotherus has to run away with his father-in-law. The struggle continues with varying success for both parties until Hotherus succeeds in secretly getting hold of the miraculous food from which Balderus derives his strength. When Hotherus meets with him shortly after, he runs his sword through him. In the meantime, heavy fighting goes on between their two armies, and in an alarming dream Bal¬ derus learns that he will soon stay with Proserpina. Three days later, his fate is sealed; his remains are buried under a barrow.31
Then follows the tale of Odin’s revenge.
It would be hopeless to try to harmonize this account with Snorri’s.32 Saxo’s source must have been a Danish tale, in which Hodr
played the foremost part, whereas Snorri was using Icelandic tradi¬
tions in which Baldr was the prominent character. Only a few details
correspond in both versions, namely Baldr’s premonitory dream and
the mention of a miraculous ring, but even these parallel features
appear in a basically different context: in the Eddie tradition, Baldr’s
dream is the point of departure for the whole chain of events, whereas
in Saxo it is nothing but an anticipation of his imminent death after
receiving a fatal wound. As for Draupnir, the “Lay of Skirnir” states
that the ring “with Baldr, was burned’’ and that “eight rings as dear
will drop from it every ninth night”; yet in Saxo it is nothing but an
armilla mira quadam arcanaque virtute possessoris opes augere solita (’an arm ring that, through a wonderful and mysterious power, used
31 Cf., e.g., Saxonis Gesta Danorum, ed. J. Olrik and H. Raeder (Copenhagen, !93"). E 63-69. 32 For a comparison between the two versions of the Baldr myth cf., e.g., E. O. G. Turville-Petre, Myth and Religion of the North (New York, 1964), pp. 113116. Dumezil, who considers Snorri’s account as representing the Scandinavian vulgate, in a letter to Otto Holler, published under the title “Hptherus et Balderus” (PBB(T) 83:259-270 [1961]), has tried to account for the differences by assuming a transfer of some of the attributes of Baldr to Hodr by Saxo when he reshaped the myth into a romantic story focused on Hotherus. Whatever new fea¬ tures Balderus has acquired are ascribed to borrowing from the myths of Freyr. Although the saga of Hadingus illustrates such adaptations of myth, it certainly does not give evidence of shifts so thoroughgoing as to confirm the assumption made here (p. 261) by Dumezil: "indifferent et sans doute ferme it l’ancienne valeur theologique des recits qu’il utilisait et des dieux qu’il transposait en heros, l’ecrivain danois les a desai ticules sans scrupule et recomposes a sa fat:on.”

to increase the riches of its owner’). Its owner is no longer Odin but
the forest demon who supplies Hodr with the weapon with which to
kill Baldr. But let us not preoccupy ourselves with such details: they merely
show the widespread Entmythisierung, the total recasting of the
mythological data into the plot of a romantic tale, as commonly oc¬
curs in the first part of Saxo’s Gesta Danorum. Apparently the Danish
historian has no personal grasp of pagan religious thinking and shows
a lack of involvement which Snorri does not share. Nevertheless, his
story is not completely worthless as a source of information about the
original form of the Baldr myth. On the contrary, whereas Snorri
modifies the myth with ethical intentions, in order to make Loki
the demonic opponent of the gods and assign to him the main role in opposition to the holy victim and the blind instrument Hodr,
Saxo shows these latter two figures to better advantage and also indi¬
cates the reason for their enmity, namely their vying with each other for the hand of Nanna (who, by the way, totally disappears in the
background in Snorri’s tale). Moreover, in Saxo’s tale Baldr and
Hodr justify their respective names by their heroic behavior: Hgdr
is the Old Norse reflex of Germanic *hapu-, ‘combat,’ which also
appears as first component of the name of Hildebrand’s father,
Hadubrand. The word is cognate with Celtic *katu-, ‘combat,’ which
also appears in the names of Germanic chieftains like Catumerus,
head of the Chatti, according to Tacitus, or Catualda, head of the
Marcomanni at the end of the first century. It also occurs in the name of the Danish hero Starkadr, which reflects a compound *starkhgdr, ‘strong warrior,’ whose meaning particularly fits with the char¬
acter of Starkadr as an “Odinic warrior.”33
33 Cf. de Vries, “Die Starkadsage,” GRM 36 (N.F. 5): 281-297 (1955). Dume¬ zil, however, contrasts Starcatherus with Sigurdr, Helgi and Haraldr in his Aspects de la fonction guerriere chez les Indo-europdens (Paris, 1956), pp. 80-93, and points out that his ugliness, grim courage, and brutal strength characterize him as a second-function figure—“une etre dont on n’a pas beaucoup d exemples dans la litterature scandinave: un Mros de porr" (p. 88). Without denying his association with Odin, especially in the episode with Vikar, Dumezil considers “l’intervention d’Othinus dans sa vie . . . telle qu’on l’attend d un dieu souverain; il fixe librement et seul le destin des individus et leur distribue les dons de nature (ibid.). He therefore objects (ibid., pp. 107-111) to the arguments of de Vries, who rightly points out, “Wie man sich das Verhaltnis der Odin- und Thormotive in der Starkadsage zu denken hat, bleibt ungewiss” (op. cit., p. 296). Dumezil s inter¬ pretation is based on Saxo’s story, which he considers as closer to the original version than that of the Gautrekssaga', but as de Vries points out, Nui die danische Oberlieferung zeigt Ansatze zu einem Starkadbild, das den Gegensatz zu Thor weniger betont” (ibid.). For an extensive discussion of the problem, cf. Turville-Petre, op. cit., pp. 205-211.



68 Edgar Polome 69
As for the name Baldr, two etymologies are usually advanced: one
is connected with the no longer accepted interpretation of Baldr as
a sun-god and derives his name from the IE root *bhel-, ‘shining,
white.’ In the Gylfaginning, he is described as having a face so beau¬
tiful and bright that rays seemed to beam from him. This argument
does not weigh very much, however, in view of the fact that such an
earthbound divine figure as the vegetation god Freyr is also called
“shining” and that his servant—actually a hypostasis of his—is called
Skirnir, ‘the bright one.’ Therefore this etymology is usually aban¬
doned in favor of the comparison with the Old English noun bealdor
which is supposed to mean ‘lord, prince.’ The name would then be¬
long to the same semantic area as Freyr, which also originally means
‘lord.’ Upon closer examination of the Old English sources, however,
it is obvious that the ascription of the meaning ‘lord, prince’ to
bealdor is unjustified, so that a third etymology may be considered.
There is, indeed, another IE root *bhel-, which refers mainly to
bursting with vital strength.34 Derived from it is the German adjective
*bald-, ‘brave, hardy’ (English bold), and connecting the name Baldr
with it becomes even more plausible when one remembers that the
name of his wife Nanna can reflect an older form *nanpd, which is related to the Old High German words nand, ‘audacity,’ and nendan,
‘dare,’ with which the Old Irish word for ‘combat,’ neit, is also akin.
Thus, the names of the three main characters of the Baldr myth
belong to the same conceptual sphere of “combat.” Since the kennings always connect the name Baldr with the concept of “warrior,”35
we could be tempted to consider Saxo’s tale as a reflex of the oldest
form of the myth, the more so since Snorri does not say a word about
this “courageous” aspect of Baldr’s personality.
The mythologem of fratricide for the possession of a woman is a
common motif in the sphere of the cult of the divine twins, where
male twins are usually associated with a female personage. In the
oldest form of the myth this woman appears as their common wife;
accordingly, Surya is the wife of both Asvins, the originally horse¬ shaped sons of the Sky-god in the Vedic sources.36 The social situation

implicit in this common possession of one wife by two brothers is
known as “phratrogamy” and seems to have been known among the Indo-Europeans. There is a tale in Pausanias according to which, on
an evening, the Spartan Dioscuri requested the owner of the house
in which they had spent their earthly life to put them up for the
night. The man accepted, but refused to let them use their former
room, as his own daughter slept there. The following morning the
latter has disappeared with all her garments, and in her room the
owner of the house found a bust of the Dioscuri with a laserwort
twig in her stead.37 This common wife can obviously easily become a source of conflict between her two spouses, and at a later period we find numerous
examples of twins who quarrel about a woman.38 In Old Indie epic
literature, for example, we hear about two brothers, Balin and
SugrJva, sons of the Sun, who resemble each other so much that people cannot tell them apart; they are very close to each other until
they glow into archenemies because of their rivalry for the hand of
Ruma.39
It is not out of the question to consider Baldr and Hodr hypostases
of the Indo-European divine twins who vie for the possession of the
same woman—but, in that case, Snorri’s account would have to be
totally disregarded. This approach has been attempted by those who
hold that Snorri had combined three originally separate elements into one continuous tale, the components being Baldr’s death, the
incineration, and Hermodr’s descent to the world of the dead. The
first and the third would have been taken over by Snorri from exist¬
ing lays, whereas the second would be based on a description of the fresco that depicted Baldr’s funeral ceremonies in the hall of the Ice¬
landic prince Glafr pai. The motif of the incineration would accord¬ ingly have been inserted between the two originally independent
alliterative poems, after the model of the Husdrapa of the Skald Ulfr Uggason.40 Yet at the end of Snorri’s account the dispatching of mes
37 On the symbolic meaning of the laserwort (al\<t>iov) in this context, cf. F. Chapouthier, Les Dioscures au service d'une deesse (Paris, 1935), pp. 88-8g. 38 Krappe, op. cit., pp. 87-89. 33 This was the conclusion de Vries reached after his analysis of the evidence on Baldr in the first edition of his Altgermanische Religionsgeschichte (Berlin and Leipzig, 1937), II, 252-253, a view shared by Giintert in his commentary on the VQluspa: Die Schau der Seherin (Heidelberg, 1944), p. 53. 40 G. Neckel, Die Oberlieferungen vom Gotte Balder (Dortmund, 1920), pp. 65-66, who considers that the contents of two lays have been combined in Snorri’s story and claims that the lay of Baldr’s death, composed around 900, must have included a description of the funeral and incineration, “woher der Schnitzer des

sengers and their meeting with the giantess Thokk are completely
independent of the descent to Hell of Hermodr, but nevertheless
are based on an older lay on account of the literal quotation of a
stanza by Snorri; one therefore wonders whether the efforts of the philologists to distinguish two different lays in the tale are justified
—the more so since the prose text itself reminds us of the rhythm of the stanza of Thokk in the passage about the meeting of the Thing
of the gods. Before fragmenting Snorri’s account, it would have been wiser to
examine carefully whether there was any organic coherence among
the three components of the mythologem. Partiality for explanations
relating to fertility rites seems to have covered up the truth in this
matter. On the basis of Frigg’s intervention and of the universal
dismay at his death, efforts have been made to transplant Baldr from
the world of the Aesir (i.e., the warlike, ruling gods) into that of the
Vanir (i.e., the protectors of agriculture and vegetation growth). He was, accordingly, brought into closer association with Freyr, the
principal vegetation god: as already pointed out, it was thought that
both names meant ‘lord’; besides, Baldr was occasionally referred to
as ‘most favorable’ and as ‘reconciling men,’ so that he could also be
considered a god of peace and welfare. Like Freyr, he was an excellent
horse rider; both excel in wisdom and bright appearance, and, like
Freyr, Baldr even has a ship.41
But how is one to explain Baldr’s death in this context? To do so,
parallels from the world of the sagas have been adduced. In the
stories about the hero Starkadr, a remarkable event took place during
a simulated sacrifice to Odin: the lot had fallen upon King Vfkar to serve as mock victim, and he was strung up, as it were, on a holy
tree; people were supposed to poke him in the side with a reed, but,
in the hands of Starkadr, the harmless cane became a spear by fateful
Olaf Pfau and Ulfr Uggason dies Motiv gekannt haben.” With reference to Snorri’s text, however, Schroder states more accurately in Germanentum und Hellenismus, p. 96: "Zwischen beide [Lieder] ist eine ausfiihrliche Schilderung von Balders Leichenfeier eingeschoben. Diese hat Snorri der Husdripa des Skalden tlrlfr Uggason entlehnt, der in diesem Gedichte bildliche Darstellungen der Baldersage besingt, die die Halle des vornehmen Islanders, Olaf Pfau schmiickten.” More recently, after pointing to the possibility of either woodcarvings (cf. Neckel, op. cit., pp. 45 ff.) or wall hangings of tapestry (cf. Rooth, op. cit., p. 140) as the source of Snorri’s description, he remarks (“Balder-Probleme,” PBB(T) 84:320 n. 1 [1962]): “Abet; auch das Lied von Balders Tod kann den Aufzug der Gotter schon gebracht haben, vgl. etwa die Aufzahlung von Rossen und Reitern in der Kiilfsvisa (Dagr reid Drgsli . . . , reid bani Bella [Freyr] BldBughofa usw.); GrlmnismAl 30, u.a.” 41 On the correspondences between Baldr and Freyr, cf. especially Schroder, Germanentum und Hellenismus, pp. 122-123.

witchcraft and pierced Vikar’s heart, so that he died then and there. The similarity between the reed and the mistletoe that caused Baldr’s
death is obvious, and the correspondence between the two episodes
becomes even more striking when one thinks that the murderous
blows are struck by characters who have actually the same name, since Starkadr means ‘strong Hodr.’ It is, accordingly, plausible to recognize originally a simulated sacrifice in the Baldr myth. But of
what kind? According to Snorri’s account, the gods indulge in a kind of
“game” on the “peace ground” at the Thing meeting. Since Baldr
is supposed to be invulnerable, their sport is a symbolic “killing,”
comparable with the numerous usages on which folklore gives us ample information: simulated fights to celebrate the spring festival,
in which the symbol of winter is fought against and vanquished;
carrying around a kind of doll or manikin, which is beaten with
rods, pierced with sticks, and finally cast into the water or burned on
a bonfire. There are dozens of such descriptions of fertility rites on Germanic territory in the collections of W. Mannhardt, J. G. Frazer,
and W. Liungman, which accounts for the fact that the Baldr myth
was connected with them.
But there is more: specialists have always been struck by the re¬
semblance of Baldr’s story to the life of Siegfried.42 The remarkable
correspondences are, indeed, especially obvious if the Scandinavian traditions of Sigurdr are taken into consideration. Like Achilles,
Siegfried is vulnerable in only one tiny spot, and a woman learns of
it by deceit from another woman. Here the murderer, Hagen, is one
eyed, whereas Hodr is supposed to be blind. In both instances a
woman is so inconsolably desperate that she ends up burning on
the funeral pyre with her murdered husband: here Briinhilde gives
Siegfried this proof of love; there Nanna dies of grief. Like Baldr
and Freyr, Siegfried is “shiningly beautiful” and is considered a
first-rate horse rider. Among the jewels that Siegfried has acquired
with the hoard of the Niebelungen, there is a ring—Andvarinaut
which reminds us in a way of Draupnir.
This comparison between the Baldr myth and the Siegfried saga
seems to be especially important with regard to the various assumed
connections of the latter with fertility rites.43 One thinks, for ex
42 cf. especially Giintert, Die Schau der Seherin, pp. 50-51. 43 Cf., e.g., H. W. J. Kroes, “Die Erweckung der Jungfrau hinter dem Flammenwall,” Neophilologus 36:144-157 (1952), esp. pp. 145, 156; Schroder, “Mythos und Heldensage,” GRM 36 (N.F.5):i-2i (1955), with revised version in Zur Germanisch-Deutschen Heldensage, ed.

ample, of the episode of the awakening of the Valkyrie in the Edda:
when Sigurdr has crossed the flames to reach the sleeping Valkyrie
and has awakened her by taking off her coat of mail, she says:
Hail to you, gods! Hail, goddesses! Hail, earth, that gives to all! Goodly spells and speech bespeak we from you, and healing hands, in this life!44
This invocation reminds us in some respects of the old hymn to the
earth goddess which survives in the Old English charm:
Hail to thee, earth, mother of men, may you be fruitful under God’s protection, filled with food for the benefit of men.45
This would typify Siegfried as a young spring god—he would be a
solar hero who performs hierogamy with the earth goddess for the
sake of blessing Nature with prosperous crops. Such an association
is, however, doomed to end fatefully with the summer solstice, and,
therefore, the statement of the Middle High German Nibelungenlied: ze einer sunneiuenden der groze mord geschah, ‘the great murder took
place at a solstice,’ does not come unexpectedly.
Would this also be the case with Baldr’s death? Such has been
the assumption of some scholars, because the fimbulvetr (‘the great
and awful winter’) to which the Ecldic Lay of Vafthmdnir alludes
might be its cosmic consequence.46 Yet if this assumption were justi¬
fied, one would expect that in accord with the usual scenario of
fertility rites, after the death of the god and the lamentation he would
rise from the dead. For Baldr there is no resurrection. To this argument the defenders of the view just discussed would
44 Sigrdrifumdl, st. 3 (Hollander, op. cit., p. 236). 45 G. Storms, Anglo-Saxon Magic (The Hague, 1948), p. 177. 46 As Schroder points out (PBB(T) 84:333 [1962]): “Im Mittelpunkt des kosmischen Geschehens steht die Gestalt Balders, mit dessen Sterben aller Segen auf Erden schwindet und der Niedergang unaufhaltsam einsetzt.” The apparently endless winter need not be an Oriental motif, as has often been assumed (cf. against A. Olrik, Ragnarok: Die Sagen vom Weltuntergang [Berlin, 1922] pp. 1519, 331-337; de Vries, Altgermanische Religionsgeschichte [2d ed], II, 399, 403; and Turville-Petre, op. cit., p. 283). If Baldr is considered a “Vegetations- und Jahresgott . . . der in der Bliite der Jugend und der Fiille der Kraft dem finsteren feindlichen Gott, dem Damon des Winters erliegt,” it will be expected that he remain “wahrend der langen Wintersnacht im unterirdischen Bereich, um erst im neuen Jahr zu neuem lichen zu erwachen.” In the context of Vqluspa. “hat der Dichter . . . den Ablauf eines einzelnen Erdenjahres zum Weltjahr gesteigert und in dieses Balder mittenhineingestellt, den Fruchtbarkeitsgott zum kosmischen Gott erholit” (Schroder, op. cit).
oppose the “Prophecy of the Seeress,’’ where the “new order” after Ragnarok is described:
On unsown acres the ears will grow, all ill grow better; will Baldr come then. Both he and Hodr will in Hropt's hall dwell. . . 47
Therefore Dumezil concluded his research on Baldr’s myth in his
book Loki in 1948 with the following statement: “Baldr . . . ressuscitera a la fin du present age du monde pour un regne idyllique, completant ainsi, au moins dans le temps cosmique, la sequence ‘naissancemort-iYsurrection’ que d’autres religions expriment dans les mythes
et dans les rites de l’alternance saisonniere.”48 But why would Odin, then, show such deep concern about Baldr’s murder? And does one not forget, in this context, that Hermodr’s descent to the world of the dead is a lost cause? Baldr ultimately has to remain in the under¬ world. Snorri’s account actually points clearly to the fact: Hermodr comes back with the promise that Baldr will be allowed to leave the netherworld under one condition: the whole world must bewail him
but the giantess Thokk does not grieve for him! Why not? According to Snorri, because she is no one else but Loki himself—but this is merely a guess of his in connection with his dualistic interpretation
of the myth as a symbol of the struggle between Good and Evil.49
47 Vgluspa, st. 61 (Hollander, op. cit., p. 12). With reference to F. Strom, Nordisk hedendom: Tro och sed i forkristen tid (Goteborg, 1961), p. 114, Schroder stresses (op. cit., p. 334 n. 16) that the mention of crops growing on unsown fields would hardly make sense if it did not point to a fertility god. 48 Loki, p. 240. In Les dieux des Germains, p. 106, Dumezil rejects this Mannhardtian theory, with reference to the criticism of de Vries in “Der Mythos von Balders Tod,” ANF 70:44-45 (1955). In the German edition of Loki (p. 195), he points out that Baldr must be considered, with de Vries, a first-function god, and not a third-function figure, as claimed by Schroder in his “Baldr und der zweite Merseburger Spruch,” pp. 161-183, an<! by Strom in Loki: Ein mythologisches Problem, GUA 62.8 (1956), pp. 96-129. Dumezil emphasizes the striking parallel between the Baldr myth and the story of the Ossetic hero Soslan, but he carefully avoids postulating a common source (op. cit., pp. 200-201), although he is tempted on account of the Mahdbharata episode (cf. above, p. 63) to assume an IndoEuropean heritage (cf. de Vries, “Loki und Kein Ende,” Festschrift fiir Franz Rolf Schroder [Heidelberg, 1959], p. 2 n. 2). 49 The original extent of Loki’s participation in Baldr’s slaying has often been discussed: as Derolez points out, "his true nature becomes more difficult to under¬ stand when he pursues the apparently innocent Baldr with his hatred to the extreme limit” (op. cit., p. 138). If he actually played the part assigned to him by Snorri, the other characters in the drama would be reduced to mere super¬ numeraries: Baldr is a martyr, Hodr a blind instrument (cf. de Vries, Altger■ manische Religionsgeschichte [2d ed.], II, 218). This is the reason why, in spite of Dumezil (Loki, pp. 133-158; German ed., pp. 94-115), it is probable that the situation described by Snorri reflects a late development, as de Vries suggested (The Problem of Loki, pp. 177-179).

The giantess who dwells in a cave is rather the goddess of death her¬ self, and her very words give us a better idea of the real meaning of the Baldr myth: through his death, Baldr has entered the land of no return. There is no question of resurrection. The core of the theme of Hermodr’s descent to Hell is accordingly the same as that of the Babylonian epic of Gilgamesh or of the Greek myth of Orpheus: no¬ body can escape death, and whoever thinks he has found a way out of it soon realizes his delusion. In Baldr’s story Hermodr returns with joy: Who would not bewail Baldr’s death? He is, accordingly, sure to be “wept out of Hell.” But Hermodr has not understood the hidden meaning of Hel’s remark: “It will have to be proved that Baldr is as much beloved by all as it is claimed.” What she actually meant was: “The whole world may unanimously wish to revive the shining god, but Death herself will remain inexorable”; therefore, she says: “What Hel has, she may keep!” in the shape of Thokk. It accordingly seems to me that the Baldr myth deals with the problem of death, without
the motif of the victorious resurrection of life from death. What, then, is the significance of Baldr’s death in the framework
of Eddie cosmic history? The “Prophecy of the Seeress” informs us about it: for the world
of the gods, this death comes as a thunderclap out of a bright clear sky, and suddenly destroys the cosmic order painstakingly established after the war with the Vanir. The seeress describes Baldr explicitly as the “gory god” (blodgom tivur), even before the murder is perpe¬ trated, almost marking him as predestined to suffer that fateful death.50 It can therefore be assumed that Baldr’s death symbolizes the entry of death into the world. Besides, if we accept Bugge’s interpre¬ tation of Old Norse tivarr as ‘sacrifice’ (as corresponding to Old Eng¬ lish tifer, ‘sacrifice,’ and Old High German zebar, sacrificial ani¬ mal’),51 it could, moreover, be considered as the first sacrifice on the
model of which later rituals developed. The connection of the Boldr myth with a sacrificial rite has al¬
ready been pointed out with reference to the death of King Vfkar in the Starkadr saga. There, the dart that pierced the heart of the victim
was a reed. Why? This plant, which grows up from muddy puddles and pools, is
the murder in the Eddie poetic source is, indeed, the twenty-eighth stanza of the Lokasenna (cf. especially Schroder, ‘‘Das Symposion der Lokasenna,” ANF 67:1-29
[1952]). ’ 50 Turville-Petre, op. cit., p. 108 (Hollander's translation ‘blessed god,’ quoted on p. 64, does not reflect the ON text accurately: bldBugr means ‘bloodstained’). 51 Cf. de Vries, Altnordisches etymologisches Worterbuch (Leiden, i960), p. 590.

often considered a symbol of the divine life that arises triumphantly from the primordial waters of chaos. This same motif is found in Old Indie cosmogonic symbolism, where the divinity reveals itself, together with the cosmos, by popping up out of a lotus floating on the waters.52 Is mistletoe also such a symbolization of the divine principle of life? The numerous studies devoted to folk customs con¬ nected with this plant clearly indicate that it is actually considered a “plant of life”;53 but in the Baldr myth it appears as the plant of life that belongs to death, or better, of a life that is not granted to man —a kind of plant like the one that Gilgamesh wanted to acquire for man, but which ultimately had to remain in the netherworld. Is Baldr, then, a man, to whom “divine” life has to be refused?
In this respect the parallelism with the Starkadr saga is particularly instructive: here the hero, acting as a warrior dedicated to Odin, be¬ comes the instrument of a fate determined by the gods54 and kills King Vfkar during the ritual of a simulated sacrifice to Odin. The similarity of name between Starkadr and Baldr’s killer has repeatedly been pointed out; the way both kill their victims is also the same. Yet Hodr is blind; he seems to be merely an instrument of Loki! Snorri, as we know, is constantly stressing the part of Loki in the
light of his ethical interpretation of the myth. Eddie tradition, how¬ ever, holds that Hodr is truly responsible for Baldr’s death.55 (Why would he, otherwise, have to “reconcile” himself with Baldr after
Ragnarok?) This fact suggests another interpretation of his part in the drama: In the Germanic pantheon, some gods occur with signifi¬ cant bodily defects, for example, the one-handed Tyr, the oneeyed Odin; it would be astonishing, to say the least, that a second Ase

Kabell, Balder and the Mistletoe, FEC 196 (Hel¬ sinki, 1965). 54 This is evidenced by the words of Odin to Starkadr in the Gautrekssaga: pa skalltu mi senda mer Vikar konung, ‘now then you shall dispatch to me King Vikar’ (cf. de Vries, “Die Starkadsage,” pp. 287-288). 55 According to the Vqluspa hin skamma (the “Short Seeress’ Prophecy” inserted in the Hyndluljdd)—VAli has avenged his brother Baldr by slaying his murdererspecifically designated as handbani, i.e., ‘actual slayer’ (cf. Old Saxon handbano [Heliand 5199], Old English handbona [Beowulf 460]). In the new world, where all disputes are settled, Hodr and Baldr can live together in Valholl (desig¬ nated in Voluspa, st. 62, as Hrdpts sigtoptir, ‘Hroptr’s [i.e. Odin’s] homes of victory,’ and, according to a plausible emendation of Rasmus Rask, ve [instead of vel\ valtivar, ‘the shrine of the gods of the slain’). This is the reason why de Vries translated the second half of stanza 62: “Hodr and Baldr, both reconciled, live in Valholl” (Edda [Amsterdam, 1966], p. 31; cf. also Derolez, op. cit., p. 136).

would show the same defect as Odin—only to a worse degree, though, since he is totally blind!56 And even this difference is of little impor¬ tance, since Odin himself is described as Tviblindi, that is, ‘blind
with both eyes.’ Is Hodr then a hypostasis of Odin himself? If this possibility be admitted, it becomes clear why Odin does not intervene during the whole process, while, on the other hand, Hodr’s appearance is restricted to the Baldr myth. But why would Odin, under the shape of Hodr, want to kill his son Baldr? Analyzing the motif of the struggle between father and son in the Hildebrandslied,
de Vries57 has indicated that it could very well be a mythologem be¬ longing to an initiation rite. The myth, in which an unruly divine hero even dares to stand up against his father, but must finally be worsted on account of the latter’s divine power, may be a symboliza¬ tion of actual facts of life as well as a warning to presumptuous young warriors who would no longer feel due respect for paternal authority. With good reason, the best specialist of Germanic mythology sur¬ mised that the same mythological content underlay the Baldr myth, a hypothesis he worked out in his article “Der Mythos von Balders
56 Hj. Falk, Odensheite, Videnskapsselskapets Skrifter II, Hist.-filos. Klasse (Christiania, 1924), p. 29; cf. also ibid., p. 15. Blindr inn bolvisi (.HelgakviSa Hundingsbana 2, st. 2), to which de Vries (Altgermanische Religionsgeschichte [2d ed.], II, 82) adds Svipdagr blindi—'v/ohl eine Hypostase von Odin.” But Schroder, PBB(T) 84:338 (1962), considers Svipdagr rather an "alten, friih verblassten Gott des Sommers, der lichten Jahreszeit, neben dem ganz urtiimlichl—also sein negativer Pol Svipdagr blindi steht, der ebensowenig wie Hod darurn nur eine Vermummung Oder Hypostase Odins ist.” He further compares the Irish tale of the death of Fergus mac Roig, whose characteristic correspondences with the Baldr myth he explicitly described in Skadi und die Gotter Skandinaviens (Tubingen, 1941), pp. 141-144: Here, Ailill prompts his blind brother Lugaid to shoot Fergus whom he describes as a stag. Schroder connects these traditions with the “polarity of the vegetation god”: “als Jahresgott [hat er], entsprechend den beiden Halften des Jahres, seine lichte und seine dunkle Seite,” which dark side then develops “als eigene Gottheit . . . zum Gegenspieler des Wachstumgottes, dem dieser erliegt” (cf. also O. Hofler, “Das Opfer in Semnonenhain,” in Edda, Skalden, Saga: Fest¬ schrift mm jo. Geburtstag von Felix Genzmer [Heidelberg, 1952], pp. 38-41). This explanation, however, does not account for the fact that, as foster-father of the Swedish king Ingjaldr illraSi, the blind Svipdagr gives him a wolf’s heart to eat, which will give him a wolf’s nature—a typical initiation motif, as de Vries points out (ANF 70.49 [1955]). Not convincing either is Dumezil’s comparison of Hodr with the Vedic Bhaga (Les dieux des Germains, p. 99); although undoubtedly “ ‘aveugle’ est tout autre chose que ‘borgne’ ” (Ilf 3:9 n. 22 [1959]), Bhaga may accurately be described as a "repartiteur des biens et des destins ... indifferent aux m^rites des hommes,” parallel to the Latin Fortuna, even if Dumcv.il now (La religion romaine archa'ique, p. 205) makes him preside more specifically over movable property (especially cattle)—a function that hardly corresponds to the episodic role played by Hodr in Eddie mythology. 57 “Das Motiv des Vater-Sohn-Kampfes im Hildebrandslied,” GRM 34 (N.F.3):

Tod,”58 the argument of which I reproduce here with slight modifi¬ cations. According to de Vries, the kernel of the myth is the killing of a son begotten on a mortal by his divine father Odin. By implication Baldr is not a god: he does not die as a vegetation god only to rise from the dead and thus give proof of his irrepressible vital strength. Baldr dies and remains dead. Although he is called “the twelfth among the Aesir,” he does not actually belong to their circle. Con¬ firmation may be found in the Skaldic poem describing the arrival in Valholl of Eirfkr bloSpx with a group of followers killed in combat: when they approach, Bragi thinks Baldr returns to the Hall with his retinue, but Odin immediately dismisses this suggestion as “non¬ sense.”59 Besides, the names Baldr, ‘valiant,’ and Hodr, ‘warrior,’ are by no means typically divine names, nor is Hermodr which means ‘courageous in combat.’ Thus the indications are that the main char¬ acters in the plot of the Baldr myth are not actually gods. This conclusion is furthermore confirmed by the funeral rites. Ob¬
viously, Snorri has interwoven them with a few mythological inci¬ dents like the episode with the giantess Hyrrokkin, which he has presumably somewhat toned down, since it can be surmised from a Skaldic poem dedicated to Thor, which explicitly mentions her as dead, that in the original version her skull was crushed by Thor in anger.60 The uncouth behavior of Thor is also evident in his treat¬ ment of the dwarf Litr. His kicking of the latter into the fire of the funeral pyre has a symbolic meaning as well; Old Norse litr, indeed, means ‘nice complexion’ and applies to the bloom of youth and health given by Lodur to the first human couple, Askr and Embla.61 The typical attribute of youth characterizing Baldr is utterly de¬ stroyed by the flames—another hint that he will not rise from the dead.
As regards the ceremony itself, it is the typical funeral of heroes: he

Her name is also very significant in this context: *Hyrhrokkinn means ‘shrunk up by fire’ (de Vries, Altnordisches etymologisches Worterbuch, p. 276). A different tradition, however, is reported in Ulfr Uggason’s Husdrdpa (st. 11), where the giantess (designated by the kenning fjalla Hildr), trudging with Baldr’s ship Hringhorni, is ultimately killed by Odin's warriors (Hropts hjalmelda gildar). 61 Cf.

is burned in a ship, with his wife and presumably also his retinue, since Modgudr, meeting Hermodr on the bridge to Hell, tells him that “five throngs of dead men” rode over Gioll, the river of Hell, the day before; his horse is also put on the funeral pyre—all in conformi¬ ty with Snorri’s statement in the Ynglingasaga that Odin instituted the usage of cremation and determined that the dead should be burned with their earthly possessions in order to have them along in
Valholl.62 This, however, prompts a question: Why does Baldr not go to Valholl after the “Odinic” sacrificial and funeral rites? Such a fate is excluded for two reasons: first of all, going to Valholl would imply an unconditional resurrection in the society of the Aesir; second, as a
symbol of man’s fate, Baldr must go to the dark realms of Hel. One more detail: Why is Draupnir returned to Hermodr? As Dumezil pointed out,63 this ring was the symbol of the regula¬ tion of time; it was accordingly out of place in the netherworld. But why, then, had Odin nevertheless placed it on the pyre? Two expla¬ nations are possible: from a cosmic angle, Baldr’s death had dis¬ rupted the cosmic order, including the regulation of time; therefore it was foreboding the end of time in Eddie eschatology; from a strictly human point of view, the ring had to return to the world of the living, because, although death marks the end of all temporal activi¬
ty for man, others will assume his temporal tasks. Taking all these elements into consideration, it is possible to sum¬ marize the components of the mythologem of Baldr in Snorri’s ac¬ count; they consist of four motifs: 1. the first occurrence of death, which is henceforth the inescapable
fate of man; 2. the establishment by Odin of human sacrifice, namely by means of a spear; 3. the introduction of cremation; 4. the failure of an effort to prevail over death for lack of fulfill¬ ment of one condition.64 Since de Vries considers the Baldr myth as the text of an initiation ritual, the problem is now to discover how these motifs are to be re¬ lated to such religious practices. The mythologem of death is the nucleus of such rituals: to be truly
a man, one must have become fully conscious of the inevitability of

death and accept it with calm resignation, with the understanding that the continually renewed existence of mankind is ensured only by the insertion of death in the cycle of life. This has been understood by the Old Norse: everywhere, death is considered as something un¬ natural; man cannot realize that it belonged to his original destiny, and he therefore ascribes it to the cunning intervention of a demonic being or to his own failure. A tiny plant was forgotten by Frigg when she received everyone’s oath; this twig will become the instrument of man’s fate. Snorri made Loki responsible, but against Dumezil and
de Vries, I believe that he did so merely on the basis of his ethical concepts, in order to assign death definitely to the demonic element,
as in the biblical cosmic drama. The heathen Germanic tribesman must have had a different outlook. He was not coddled as a child; “a parvulis labori et duritiae student,” says Caesar;65 only after proving their competence with pain and courage were they allowed to carry arms and to take their place in the social community, adds Tacitus.66 This acceptance in the group, or rather, this passage from youth to the adult world of warriors was conditioned by particularly severe tests, as many tales show, for example, the Vplsunga Saga. Here, the mother of Sinfjotli, the future warrior dedicated to Odin, tests the
courage of her children by sewing their shirts to their skins. All her sons cry with pain, but Sinfjotli bites his lips and does not breathe a word. Then she violently pulls the shirt from his body so that the skin of his arms is left hanging on the sleeves, but he remains silent. As she asks him if he does not feel anything, he simply answers: “For a Volsungr, this can merely be called insignificant pain.” Then his father Sigmundr puts him through another test: he must knead a bag
of flour in which a venomous snake is hidden, but he does not even notice it. Later, father and son put on wolfskins, and Sinfjotli now has to attack at least seven enemies at once. He, however, kills eleven of them. Seeing this, his father jumps at his throat and “kills” him, to revive him immediately afterward with a magic herb that a raven brought him.67 After this strenuous “initiation” Sinfjotli is deemed capable of fulfilling his task, that is, avenging his grandfather’s death. The parallelism with Baldr’s myth is obvious: Sinfjotli’s mother

berg. 1937]. PP- 203). 67 Vplsunga Saga, chap. 8. The appearance of Odin’s bird is but one of the numerous “Odinic” features of this “ins Heroische gesteigerte Form alter Initiationsbrauche” (de Vries, ANF 70:55 [1955], with further reference to Holler, Kultische Geheimbiinde der Germanen [Frankfurt, 1934], pp. 190 ff.).

imposes difficult tests upon him in order to acquaint him with pain and fortify him against it. Is this not also the symbolic meaning of the oaths that Frigg receives? Owing to these preparatory steps taken by her, Baldr is apparently ready for any trial imposed upon him at the Thing. Then comes the ordeal of the initiation: this is a strictly manly affair; no women are allowed, a fact that excludes the possi¬ bility of a manifestation of a vegetation cult, which would not fit with the activity of the Aesir at the Thing meeting either. Frigg only hears what has happened from Loki who visits her, disguised as a woman. Otherwise, why would she have to ask: “Do you know what the Aesir did at the Thing meeting?’’ This clearly indicates that, like Sinfjotli’s mother, she had to forfeit her son totally to the male community, quite in keeping with Tacitus’ statement that before this transition rite the youths were members of the household, but that after it they belonged to the community.68
In both cases the final phase of the ritual is death, but Sinfjotli is immediately called back to life to fulfill his manly task. This is im¬ possible in Baldr’s case on account of the basic meaning of the mythologem, but Baldr is nevertheless reborn in another warrior, his own avenger, Vali, the son whom Odin begets for this very purpose and who, merely one night old, brings Baldr’s slayer to the stake.
Several elements indicate that Vali represents the initiate who has become a “new man.” First of all, his name does not reflect Germanic *wanilo, ‘little Vane,’ that is, young vegetation god, as is usually as¬ sumed,69 but rather Old Norse *waihalaR, ‘little warrior.’ He is the youth who triumphantly sustained the hardships of the ordeal of initiation of an “Odinic” warrior and has just been accepted into the virile community where he is immediately expected to perform his first task as a warrior, that is, to kill his first enemy. This is explicitly indicated by the “Prophecy of the Seeress,” according to which he
“neither cleansed his hands nor combed his hair till Baldr’s slayer he sent to Hel,”70 a statement that reminds us of what Tacitus said about the typical “Odinic” warriors, the Chatti: “It has become a general usage among the Chatti that, as soon as they have reached puberty, they let their hair and beard grow and do not cut this facial adorn¬ ment, vowed and pledged to courage, until they have killed an en¬ emy. They then shave themselves on the bloody corpse and spoils,

and pretend that only then they have paid back the price of their
birth. . . .”n If, then, the Baldr myth is the mythologem of an initiation rite, how was it accomplished? Presumably the initiate stood in the middle of a circle of men; all kinds of weapons were thrown at him. Then “Odin” appeared under the shape of Hodr—the “warrior” par excel¬ lence; he cast the mistletoe. As struck by death, the initiate fell on the ground. This was probably enacted very realistically, so that the youth was really considered dead—hence the display of grief! The prior being was another man—reborn but not resurrected.72 The Baldr myth appears, accordingly, as a mythologic drama with a rich symbolism, in which the problem of man facing his destiny is solved in the framework of a typically Germanic social structure.
If this reexamination of the Baldr myth warns us to be careful about too hasty and far-reaching comparisons outside the Germanic social framework, other myths, on the contrary, give evidence of the elaboration of inherited Indo-European mythologems, for example,
the cosmogonic episode about the creation of man in the “Prophecy of the Seeress,” where the participating gods grant man attributes in keeping with their functional position in the Germanic pantheon.73 Especially interesting in this context is the role of Lodur who endows man with “hair and beautiful complexion,” his gifts relating to the physical aspect of man being perfectly in keeping with his probable Vanic origin; his name is, indeed, presumably closely connected with that of the Italic god Liber, who presides over growth and generation
71 Germania, chap. 31 (cf. Much, op. cit., pp. 291-292). 72 As de Vries accurately points out (ANF 70:56 [1955]): “Die Initiation ist ja ein Durchgang durch den Tod. der zu der Geburt eines neuen, geschlechtsreifen, erwachsenen Mannes fiihrt . . . Der junge Viili stellt also gewisserraassen den wiedergeborenen Balder selber dar; fortan lebt er nur seiner Rachepflicht.” Another feature in the Baldr myth which clearly points to initiation practices is Odin’s murmuring something into the ear of Baldr before he mounted the pyre (VafpruSnismal, st. 54-55): this act corresponds to the communication of a secret message, the magic password, that will give the initiate entrance and recognition in his new world. No wonder Vafthrudnir is defeated in the contest of wit by Odin’s question about this message: only initiates know its content and, as a rule, they are strictly forbidden, under gravest penalties, to communicate it. Compare as a parallel Schroder, “Balder und der zweite Merseburger Spruch,’’ p. 182: “Es ist zugleich die zentrale Szene des kultischen Spieles: Odin tritt zu Balder, murmelt ihm das geheimnisvolle Wort ins Ohr, das ‘beseelende’ Wort, bestreicht seine Lippen mit Honig—und Balder erwacht zu neuem Leben.” For further discussion of de Vries’s illuminating interpretation of the Baldr myth as an initiation rite, cf. W. Betz, “Die altgermanische Religion,” in W. Stammler, ed., Deutsche Fhilologie im Aufriss (Berlin, 1957), III, cols. 2506-2508, 2d ed.

and protects the community. The analysis of such Eddie passages shows that careful reexamination of myth may still open valuable new avenues of research into the survival of Indo-European divine
archetypes in Germanic.74

The “Kingship in Heaven” Theme
C. SCOTT LITTLETON, Occidental College
INTRODUCTION
By all odds the most important single episode in Greek mythology is the one that begins with the emergence of Ouranos out of Chaos and ends with the final triumph of Zeus over Kronos and his fellow Ti¬ tans; for on this account of how Zeus came to succeed to the “Kingship in Heaven’’ depend, directly or indirectly, almost all other Greek myths, sagas, and folktales, to say nothing of their associated rituals and ceremonies. It formed, in the Malinowskian sense, the “charter”1 that legitimized the position of the Olympians relative to all other classes of natural and supernatural beings, and in so doing provided a firm foundation for the religious beliefs and practices of
the ancient Greek-speaking community. Yet, despite its fundamental importance to the whole structure of Greek myth and religion, the parenthood of these traditions relative to the “Kingship in Heaven” remains obscure. Through archaeologi¬ cal and linguistic research2 it has become increasingly apparent that
1 According to B. Malinowski (Magic, Science and Religion [New York, 1955], p. 101), myth is "... a vital ingredient of human civilization; it is not an idle tale, but a hard-worked active force; it is not an intellectual explanation or an artistic imagery, but a pragmatic charter of primitive faith and moral wisdom.” 2 The first to recognize the basic similarity between the Hittite-Hurrian and Greek versions of the "Kingship in Heaven” theme seems to have been E. O. Forrer; cf. his “Eine Geschichte des Gotterkonigtums aus dem Hatti-Reiche," in Melanges Franz Cumont, AlPhO 4 (Brussels, 1936), pp. 687-713. A second pioneer work in this area is H. G. Giiterbock’s Kumarbi, Mythen vom churritischen Kro¬ nos, aus den hethitischen Fragmenten zusammengestellt, iibersetzt und erklart (Is¬ tanbul, 1946). The Phoenician version was first put into its proper perspective by

the “Kingship in Heaven” theme,3 as it has come to be called, was in fact quite widely distributed and that it generally served a legitimiz¬ ing function similar to that served by it among the Greeks. Its pres¬ ence can be documented in the Hittite and Hurrian “Kumarbi” myths, in the Phoenician “Tlreogony” of Philo of Byblos, in the Iranian Shahnameh or “Book of Kings,” as recorded by Firdausi, and, as I attempt to demonstrate, in two Bablyonian accounts of the Creation—the well-known Enuma-Elish4 and the newly translated “Tlreogony of Dunnu”—and in the Norse traditions surrounding the
ancestry and ascendance of Odin, as recorded in the Edda’s of Saemund and Snorri. In each instance a single pattern of events is pres¬ ent: an existing generation of gods was preceded by two (and in some cases three) earlier generations of supernatural beings, each succeed¬ ing generation being presided over by a “king in heaven” who has usurped (or at least assumed) the power of his predecessor. Moreover, there is generally a fourth figure, a monster of some sort, who, acting on behalf of the deposed “king” (in the Iranian and Babylonian versions, as we shall see, the monster became identified with the de¬ posed “king” himself), presents a challenge to the final heavenly
ruler and must be overcome before the latter can assert full and per¬ petual authority.
In considering the source of this “Kingship in Heaven” theme, one question necessarily looms large to the student of comparative IndoEuropean mythology: despite its apparent absence in the Indie, Balto-Slavic, Italic, and Celtic traditions (discussed later) and its occurrence in a variety of non-Indo-European speaking traditions, is there any possibility that the theme is ultimately derived from one that was present in the Indo-European Urmytliologiel Perhaps the most ardent advocate of the Indo-European origin theory is the eminent Swedish Iranianist Stig Wikander,5 who maintains that “l’histoire des Ouranides,” as he terms it, reached the non-IndoEuropean peoples of Mesopotamia and Syria only after they had come into contact with the Hittites and Indo-Iranians who penetrated
C. Clemen (Die phonikische Religion nach Philo von Byblos [Leipzig, 1939]), and the Iranian version was discovered by S. Wikander, "Hethitiska myter hos greker och perser,” VSLA (1951), pp. 35-56. 3 Cf. Giiterbock’s “Konigtum im Himmel”; E. Laroche’s “Royaute au Ciel.” By theme I mean an expression of an idea or set of related ideas rather than a specific type of narrative or tale; cf. S. Thompson’s definition of “tale-type:” “. . . a tra¬ ditional tale that has an independent existence” (The Folktale [New York, 1946], p. 415). It should, be noted, however, that in perhaps the majority of instances cognate expressions of a given theme will involve similar patterns of events and consequently may reflect a single tale-type. 4 Literally “When-on-High,” from the opening words of the poem. 5 Op. cit.; “Histoire des Ouranides,” CS 36 (314):9—17 (1952).

The “Kingship in Heaven” Theme
this region after 2000 b.c. This opinion is not shared, however, by most Orientalists. E. A. Speiser,6 for example, although he suggests that the extant form of the Enuma-Elish seems to reflect an imme¬ diate Hittite or Hurrian origin, is nevertheless convinced that its roots lie deep in the early Babylonian and Sumerian traditions. A basically similar view has been advanced by the Hittitologist H. G. Giiterbock,7 who asserts that the Hittite version of the theme, from which the Phoenician and eventually the Greek versions appear to
derive, is itself based upon Hurrian models, which in turn are prob¬ ably derived from early Mesopotamian prototypes. No one, however, has as yet attempted to resolve this question on the basis of a systematic, comparative survey of all the mythological materials relative to the “Kingship in Heaven.”8 The purposes of this paper9 are thus (1) to put into evidence the salient points of similarity and difference between the several versions of the theme in question, among which I include two that heretofore have not generally been recognized as such, the Norse and Babylonian ver¬ sions, and (2) to consider the question of Indo-European origin in light of the patterns revealed by this survey. I begin with the Greek version which, although it contains neither the oldest10 nor neces¬ sarily the “purest” expression of the theme, is by far the most elabo¬ rate, best documented, and most familiar of the versions to be considered and thus can serve as a convenient point of departure.

It will appear in the proceedings (cf. p. 263, below). I should like to thank Professor Jaan Puhvel for his invaluable advice and en¬ couragement not only as far as the present paper is concerned, but also throughout the entire course of the research upon which it is based. Special thanks are owing as well to Professor H. G. Giiterbock of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago for his most helpful comments and suggestions. 10 The Hittite-Hurrian version (ca. 1400 B.c.) antedates Hesiod by at least 700 years, and the Babylonian versions may well be of much greater antiquity.

mary sources, the earliest and most important Greek source of data concerning the theme under discussion is to be found in the Hesiodic poems, especially the Theogony. Composed during the later part of the eighth century b.c.,11 the Theogony is concerned primarily with the events surrounding and preceding the ascension of Zeus as “king” in heaven. It served as the major source of information about cosmogonic and theogonic matters for most Greek (and Roman) poets, essayists, and dramatists. A second source is to be found in the Bibliotheca of Apollodorus, which was composed sometime during the first or second centuries b.c.12 While drawing heavily upon Hesiod, Apollodorus also includes certain data that are at variance with those contained in the Theogony, and therefore, as it may reflect an ongoing popular tradition that was either over¬ looked by or inaccessible to Hesiod, the Bibliotheca must be con¬ sidered a primary source not only for the Greek version of the “Kingship in Heaven” but for Greek mythological data in general. Our third source is the Dionysiaca of Nonnos which, despite its fifth century a.d. date,13 includes some original materials relevant to the theme not found elsewhere among classical works on myth. Nonnos, as we shall see, is especially concerned with the combat between
Zeus and Typhon, and his description of this struggle may reflect a popular tradition unknown to either Hesiod or Apollodorus.
According to both the Theogony and the Bibliotheca14 the first “king” in heaven is Ouranos (“Heaven” or “Sky”). In the Theogony, Heaven is born of Gaia (“Earth”), who is apparently autochthonous, although she is preceded by the nonpersonified state or condition termed Chaos: “Verily at first Chaos came to be, but next widebosomed Earth, the ever sure foundation of all. . . Earth or Gaia then gives birth to various beings (e.g.. Hills; Pontos [“the Deep”]; Theogony 130) who are not specifically important to the theme under consideration. Next, she takes Heaven as a husband: “But afterwards she lay with Heaven . . .” (Theogony 135). Thus Hesiod defines the first generation.
In the Bibliotheca, these events are simplified; “Sky was the first who ruled over the whole world. And having wedded Earth . . .” (1.1.1). There is no hint of the incestuous situation described in the

The “Kingship in Heaven” Theme
Theogony. To Apollodorus, both Sky and Earth appear to be au¬
tochthonous. At any event, with the marriage of Ouranos and Gaia we may proceed to the second generation, which includes the offspring of
this primal pair, the youngest of whom is destined to become the second “king” in heaven. In the Theogony (135) Earth has inter¬ course with Heaven and brings forth first “Okeanos, Koios and Krios and Hyperion and Iapetos, Theia and Rhea, Themis and Mnemosyne . . . Phoibe and . . . Tethys.” After these, she bears the so-called Hundred-handed: Kottos, Briareos, and Gyes, termed by Hesiod “presumptuous children” (Theogony 145). Then she bears the Cyclopes (“Orb-eyed”): Brontes, Steropes, and Arges;15 finally,
she bears Kronos.16 In the Bibliotheca these events are similarly reported (1.1.2-4).
_77 Called, respectively, “Thunderer,” ‘Tightener,” and “Vivid One” (cf. Evelyn
White, op. cit., p. 89.). . . 16 The etymology of Kronos (Kpovos) is obscure (cf. H. Frisk, Gnechisches etymologisches Worterbuch [Heidelberg, 1961], II, 24-25; L. R. Farnell, The Cults of the Greek States [Oxford, 1896], I, 23). It has been suggested that the name was a variant form of Chronos (Xpovos or ‘Time’), though the shift from initial X to K would be difficult, if not impossible, to support philologically (cf. H. J. Rose, A Handbook of Greek Mythology [New York, 1959], p. 69). Another etymol¬ ogy has connected Kronos with Kpalvw and has rendered the meaning as ‘ripener’ or ‘completer.’ While both Frisk {op. cit.) and Rose {op. cit.) consider this equally impossible philologically, the fact that Kronos was inevitably equated with Saturnus by most Latin authors (cf. Vergil, Ovid, Plutarch, et al.) should not be overlooked. Saturnus appears originally to have been a harvest god, a god who “ripened” or “completed” crops, and the early and consistent equation of this Roman deity with Kronos may well indicate that the latter once served a similar function. Finally, S. Janez ("Kronos und der Walfisch,” Linguistica 2:54-56 [Sup¬ plement of Slavisticna Revija 9, 1956] has proposed that the name Kronos be equated with Old English hrdn, ‘whale,’ which, according to the first Germanic sound shift, would be philologically acceptable. He points out that the Greeks re¬ ferred to Gibraltar as Kpovov arrjXai and compares this to Old English Hronesnaess (Beowulf 2805, 3136). Janez suggests that certain “popular superstitions” concerning emasculation of the whale during the sex act may yield a clue to the relationship between Kronos and whales; indeed, in a number of late traditions, especially in the younger Orphic theogonies, Kronos is represented as having been castrated by Zeus (cf. Pauly-Wissowa, Realencyclopddie der Klassischen Altertumswissenschaft, vol. 11, p. 2009 [33]: “Zeus den Kronos mit Honig trunken macht und ihn dann im Schlaf fesselt und entmannt”; W. H. Roscher, Ausfuhrliches Lexicon der griechischen und romischen Mythologie [Leipzig, i8go], II, 1470-1471). It appears likely, however, that these late traditions were the result of conscious attempts by theologians to harmonize Zeus’s overthrow of Kronos with the latter’s overthrow of Ouranos, and it seems to me that, if Janez's equation Kpovos — hrdn be correct, the mere fact that the whale is an obvious symbol of bigness (cf. the English expression “a whale of a . . .”) may explain the relationship more effi¬ ciently; perhaps the name Kronos itself is but the survival of an epithet once applied to a being (a harvest god?) whose proper name had disappeared before Homer’s time.

Here, Apollodorus introduces the terms “Titan” (male) and “Titanide” (female) to refer to these offspring, terms Hesiod uses at a later point (see below). Ouranos was jealous of his offspring, especially the Cyclopes and the giant Hundred-handed, and “used to hide them all away in a secret place of Earth ... [Tartaros] ... so soon as each was born, and would not suffer them to come up into the light...” (Theogony 155). Apollodorus (1.1.2—4) gives us a similar picture, locating Tartaros as a “gloomy place in Hades as far from earth as earth is distant from the sky.” Here he follows Hesiod, who, in a later context (Theogony 725) describes Tartaros as so far below the earth that “a brazen anvil falling from earth nine nights and days would reach Tartaros upon the tenth.”
Gaia, incensed over the treatment of her children by Ouranos, exhorts them to “ '. . . punish the vile outrage of your father; for he first thought of doing shameful things’ ” (Theogony 165). None but Kronos, however, has the courage to take action (Theogony 165), and he tells her: “ \ . . I will undertake to do this deed, for 1 rever¬ ence not our father of evil name. . . ” The deed consists of an emasculation of Ouranos, performed with an “element of grey flint” made into a “jagged sickle” (Theogony 170), which Apollodorus (1.1.4) terms an “adamantine sickle.”17 Kronos ambushes his father, cuts off the latter’s “members,” and casts them into the sea. The blood so spilled impregnates Earth, who gives birth to the Giants (Theo¬ gony 180) and to the Furies (Bibliotheca 1.1.4). The seaborne “mem¬ bers” ultimately reach Cyprus and give birth to Aphrodite.18
With the emasculation of Ouranos his power has gone, and Kronos becomes “king in heaven.” It is worth noting here for later compara¬ tive purposes that Ouranos is not killed by Kronos, merely rendered powerless. Kronos is a rebel, but not a parricide.
As regards the nature of this rebellion there seems to be a diver¬ gence between the two main sources. Hesiod, as we have seen, gives the impression that it was all accomplished—through guile—by Kronos himself, whereas Apollodorus implies that Kronos was merely the leader of a general attack against the father, one in which all
17 Cf. M. P. Nilsson, “The Sickle of Kronos,” ABSA 46:122-124 (1939). Like Kronos, Saturnus is also associated with a sickle, Greek apittj. This seems to be a proto-Indo-European term found also in Balto-Slavic (Lettish sirpe, Russian serp) and borrowed into Finno-Ugric (Finnish sirppi, ‘sickle’). Perhaps the “adaman¬ tine” blade used 'Ey Kronos against Ouranos was originally a tool associated with an Indo-European harvest god ancestral to both Kronos and Saturnus (cf. n. 16, above). 1* Cf. Rose, op. cit., p. 22.

save one of those siblings not previously consigned to Tartaros took part (Bibliotheca 1.1.4): “And they, all but Ocean, attacked him , . . and having dethroned their father, they brought up their brethren who had been hurled down to Tartaros, and committed the sover¬ eignty to Kronos.” In any case, after his ascension to power Kronos reconsigns all(?) these siblings to Tartaros (Bibliotheca 1.1.5): “But
he again bound and shut them up in Tartaros. . . .” Kronos, now firmly seated on the heavenly throne, marries his sister Rhea (Theogony 455; Bibliotheca 1.1.5). The children pro¬ duced by this union suffer an unhappy fate, for Kronos, hearing from Heaven and Earth a prophecy that he is destined to be overthrown by his own son (Theogony 410, Bibliotheca 1.1.5), swallows his offspring as fast as they are born. Here, too, we have an episode that may be used for later comparative purposes: the swallowing of one’s
offspring. The swallowed children include first (Bibliotheca 1.1.5) Hestia,
“then Demeter and Hera, and after them Pluto (Hades) and Posei¬ don.” Finally, pregnant with Zeus, Rhea decides to foil Kronos. As to the birth of Zeus our sources differ slightly. Both Apollodorus and Hesiod claim that the event took place in Crete; just where in Crete
has long been a matter of some debate.19 A great deal of attention is given to the events surrounding the birth and upbringing of this youngest of Kronos’ sons, an attention directed neither to the births of Zeus’s siblings nor to those of the preceding generations of gods (or Titans), and several of these events must be mentioned as they have analogues in the versions to be dis¬
cussed shortly. After hiding her son in Crete, Rhea gives Kronos (Theogony 485) “a great stone wrapped in swaddling clothes. Then
he took it in his hands and thrust it down into his belly. . . .” Thus is Kronos deceived by his wife, an event that seems to parallel the duplicity of Gaia in the castration of Ouranos. Apollodorus gives us some information concerning the childhood of Zeus which may also have some comparative value (Bibliotheca 1.1.7): “She [Rhea] gave him to the Kouretes and to the nymphs Adrasteia and Ida,20
19 Frazer (op. cit., p. 6) sums up this controversy rather succinctly: "According to Hesiod, Rhea gave birth to Zeus in Crete, and the infant god was hidden away in a cave of Mount Aegeum (Theogony 468-480). Diodorus Siculus (5.70) mentions the legend that Zeus was born at Dicte in Crete, and that the god afterwards founded a city on the site. But according to Diodorus, or his authorities, the child was brought up in a cave on Mount Ida. . . . The wavering of tradition on this point is indicated by Apollodorus who, while he calls the mountain Dicte, names one of the gods Ida.” 20 Cf. ibid.

daughters of Melisseus, to nurse. So these nymphs fed the child on the milk of Amalthea.” This last is apparently either a goat or a cow.21 We shall have occasion to observe two other cases of this sort, that is, suckling by a goat or a cow, in the Iranian and in the Norse tra¬ ditions.
Thus, Zeus matures to manhood, being one of the few Greek gods (or Titans) to have a defined childhood.22 Both Apollcdorus (1.2.1) and Hesiod (Theogony 490) indicate that this childhood lasted for a fair number of years.
Upon reaching adulthood, Zeus returns to heaven and sets about the overthrow of his father. According to the Bibliotheca (1.2.1) he “took Metis, daughter of Ocean, to help him, and she gave Kronos a drug to swallow, which forced him to disgorge first the stone and then the children whom he had swallowed. . . .” In the Theogony
(495) Zeus is aided by Earth, who, apparently realizing that her son is evil, beguiles Kronos with “deep suggestions’’ and causes him to vomit up her grandchildren. This time, however, the older genera¬ tion does not give up without a fight, and there ensues the famous “War of the Titans and Gods,” (the latter term now used by both
Hesiod and Apollodorus to distinguish the third generation [i.e., that of Zeus, Poseidon, Hera, et al.~\ from the two that preceded it). The war lasts ten years (Bibliotheca 1.2.1). On the one side are ranged Kronos and his siblings (save those still bound in Tartaros), and on the other Zeus, his mother,23 and his siblings. Zeus enlists the aid of the Hundred-handed and the Cyclopes, whom he delivers from their subterranean prison. The latter forge thunderbolts for use against their Titan brethren, and for this they later escape the pun¬
ishment of Kronos and the rest of the Titans (Bibliotheca 1.2.2). It is in this connection that we first see Zeus associated with the sky and with meteorological phenomena, for Zeus’s chief weapon is the thunderbolt.
Having defeated the Titans, Zeus now becomes the third and per¬ petual “king in heaven.” As Apollodorus puts it (1.2.2), Zeus “over¬ came the Titans, shut them up in Tartaros, and appointed the
21 Frazer (ibid., p. 7) claims that “According to Callimachus, Amalthea was a goat. Aratus also reported, if he did not believe, the story that the supreme god had been suckled by a goat (Strabo, viii.7.5, p. 387). . . .” 22 Cf. that of Hermes (Homeric Hymn 4.17-19): "At dawn he [Hermes] was born, by noon he was playing on the lyre, and that evening he stole the cattle of Apollo Fardarter. . . .” 23 Although the extent to which Rhea is involved in the conspiracy to dislodge her offspring from Kronos’ stomach is unclear, all accounts agree that she sides with Zeus in the ensuing struggle against her husband; cf. W. H. Roscher, “Rhea,” in L. Preller, Griechische Mythologie, I (Berlin, 1894), 638 f.

The "Kingship in Heaven” Theme
Hundred-handed their guards.24 According to the Bibliotheca (1.2.2),
the gods cast lots for the sovereignty, and Zeus was allotted the dominion of the sky, to Poseidon the dominion of the sea, and to Pluto the dominion in Hades.” This lot-casting aspect is not included in the Theogony, apparently Hesiod merely assumed that Zeus suc¬
ceeded to the position vacated by his father. Thus the Olympians, a new breed of supernatural beings, have succeeded to power. But this power is not yet secure; it remains to be confirmed by the conflict between Zeus and a final challenger, the
monster Typhon (or Typhoeus).25 According to Hesiod, “Typhoeus” is the youngest child of Earth, fathered by a personification of Tartaros at some point following the defeat of the Titans (Theogony 820). Apollodorus agrees as to the parentage of the monster, but locates his birth at a somewhat later point, that is, after a successful conclusion of the war of the Olym¬ pians against the Giants (offspring of Earth; see above). According to the Bibliotheca (1.4.2), “When the gods had overcome the giants, Earth, still more outraged, had intercourse with Tartaros and brought forth Typhon in Cilicia, a hybrid between man and beast.” This reference to Cilicia has been used to claim an Oriental origin for the Typhon story; I return to this point shortly when I consider
the Phoenician and Hittite traditions. While there are some minor differences as to details, all three of
24 That Kronos and his fellow Titans escaped eternal punishment in Tartaros is reflected in a number of variant traditions, some of them quite early. In his Works and Days (169), Hesiod himself claims that Zeus gave Kronos and his fel¬ lows "a living and an abode apart from men, and made them dwell at the ends of the earth . . . untouched by sorrow in the islands of the blessed along the shore of deep swirling Ocean, happy heroes for whom the grain-giving earth bears honey and sweet fruit. . . .” Hesiod also claims (ibid.) that Kionos lules over them; for the father of men and gods [i.e., Zeus] released him from his bonds.” The idea that Kronos’ ultimate fate is to rule over a group of western Elysian islands (i.e., the “islands of the blessed”) is reflected in Pindar (Olymp. Odes, 2) and later in Plutarch (De defectu oraculorum 420), the latter claiming that Kronos, guarded by Briareos, sleeps peacefully on a sacred island near Britain. Veigil (Aeneid 8.319, 355-358) asserts that the defeated Titan fled by sea to Latium, where he founded a city, Saturnia, on the future site of Rome, and that the name of the district stems from Kronos' (i.e., Saturnus’) hiding (latere) in it (cf. Rose, op. cit., p. 45). The association of Kronos with the West, especially Italy, in the minds of later Greek and Roman writers can be seen in the assertion by Dionysius of Halicarnassus (1.36.1) that the Golden Age, which preceded the ascension of Zeus as “king in heaven,” was in Italy under Kronos. It should also be noted that the element of escape or banishment resulting in a sea voyage has an interesting counterpart in the Norse version to be considered presently; cf. the fate of the
giant Bergelmir. 25 Hesiod renders the monster’s name as “Typhoeus”; Apollodorus and Nonnos render it as “Typhon.”

our Greek sources agree upon one important aspect of Typhon’s (or Typhoeus’) physical appearance: snakes grow from his body. As Hesiod puts it (Theogony 823), “From his shoulders grew a hun¬ dred heads of a snake.” This aspect of Typhon’s appearance will be especially important when we turn to the Iranian version (cf. below, Firdausi’s description of the monster Zohak). Also worthy of note here is Nonnos’ description of Typhon advancing to battle (Dionysiaca 1.266—268), “There stood Typhon in the fish-giving sea, his feet firm on the weedy bottom, his belly in the air and (his head?) crushed in the clouds,” which corresponds almost exactly to a similar descrip¬ tion in the Hittite version (see below, the description of the monster Ullikummi before Mount Hazzi). That Zeus defeats this monstrous challenger is agreed upon by all concerned. But between Hesiod and both Apollodorus and Nonnos there are some important divergences when it comes to the manner and location of this defeat. In the Theogony the defeat of Typhoeus is accomplished rapidly and apparently with little effort on Zeus’s part; the latter merely “leaped from Olympus and struck him (i.e., Typhoeus), and burned all the marvelous heads of the monster about him.” This accomplished, “Typhoeus was hurled down, a maimed wreck . . finally, “in the bitterness of his anger Zeus cast him into wide Tartaros” (Theogony 850-869). Apollodorus, how¬ ever, claims that Zeus uses an “adamantine sickle” to inflict a mortal wound upon Typhon, who flees to “Mount Kasios26 which over¬ hangs Syria.” There, however, Typhon is able to wrest the sickle from Zeus and use it(?) to sever the sinews of the latter’s hands and feet.27 Then Typhon lifts Zeus to his shoulders (his power having briefly returned, apparently owing to Zeus’s temporary physical incapacity) and carries him to the famous Corycian cave, again in Cilicia. Hiding the sinews, he leaves the “she-dragon Delphyne” to guard his pri¬ soner. Hermes and Aigipan steal the sinews from their bearskin hiding place and, unobserved by the monster, fit them again to Zeus (•Bibliotheca 1.3.2). There is also a tradition (Oppian, Halieutica 3.15-25) wherein Corycian Pan lures Typhon out of the cave with a
26 The modern Kel Dag or “Bald Mountain,” located just south of the mouth of the Orontes River in what is now Turkey. 27 Nonnos also mentions the sinew-cutting episode (Dionysiaca 1.482-512). Here Kadmos comes to Zeus’s aid instead of Hermes. In a note to his translation of the Dionysiacaf, (op. cit., pp. 40-41) Rouse points out that “the story is obscurely told, and' probably Nonnos did not understand it; it is obviously old. By some device or by a well-aimed blow, Typhon had evidently cut the sinews out of Zeus’s arms, thus disabling him; Cadmos now gets them back by pretending that he wants them for harp strings.” In this version there is no mention of a sickle, adamantine or other.
The “Kingship in Heaven” Theme 93
fish meal. In any event, Zeus regains his power. He pursues Typhon across Thrace and finally to Sicily, where he administers the coup de grace by burying the monster inside Mount Etna (Bibliotheca 1.3.3). It is clear that this final battle between the chief of the Olympians and the last and most monstrous representative of the old order in¬ volves more than is usually involved in most mythological monster slayings. Nonnos underscores this: “No herds of cattle were the cause of that struggle, no flocks of sheep, this was no quarrel for a beauti¬ ful woman, no fray for a petty town: heaven itself was the stake in the fight . . .” (Dionysiaca 2.359-363; italics mine). Thus, having de¬ feated Typhon, Zeus has firmly consolidated the position of his revolutionary Olympian regime. Henceforth, he will rule as per¬ petual and unchallenged “king” in heaven. Before leaving the Typhon episode, I should perhaps mention in passing that some years ago F. Vian suggested that it presents a num¬ ber of interesting parallels to the widespread and quite probably Indo-European tradition wherein a hero (or a triad of heroes) slays a three-headed monster that is menacing the peace and security of the community (cf. the Indian account of the conflict between Indra and the tricephalic son of Tvastar and the Roman legend of a fight between the three Horatii and the three Curiatii).28 I shall have more to say about this later on in the context of a general discussion of the possibility that the idea of the divine kingship is Indo-European
in origin. The myths concerning the later exploits of Zeus, his brethren, and his offspring, as well as those that concern the affairs of gods and mortals in subsequent generations (e.g., the Oedipus cycle, the siege of Troy) are not specifically germane to the theme in question, and therefore the delineation of the Greek version is concluded at this point. If I have dwelt here overlong, it is only because in the Greek tradition relative to the “Kingship in Heaven” there is a “model,” so to speak, which can be utilized in making comparative statements as I consider the evidence from Anatolia, Phoenicia, Iran, Scandinavia, and Mesopotamia.
THE HURRIAN-HITTITE VERSION

of Ullikummi,” there has been a renewed interest in the argument —originally based on the presence of a Phoenician version of the theme under consideration—that the Greek “Kingship in Heaven’’ tradition just delineated is actually composed of myths having their origin somewhere in the ancient Near East. Indeed, I use the term “Hittite-Hurrian’’ here because of the indisputable evidence31 that the Hurrians, who were well established in northern Syria and Mesopotamia by the middle of the second millennium b.c... and whose language appears to have been neither Indo-European nor Semitic, also possessed versions of the myths discussed below.
The texts containing the Hittite and/or Hurrian myths in ques¬ tion date approximately from the thirteenth century b.c. and were translated from a series of cuneiform tablets32 found at Hattusha, the ancient Hittite capital, the site of which is located near the modern Turkish village of Bogazkoy. These tablets are not well preserved and countless interpolations have had to be made in order to arrive at anything like a coherent narrative.33 That which Giiterbock terms
the “Theogony’’—the Hittite title is unfortunately missing—deals spe¬ cifically with the “Kingship in Heaven.” In it we see four generations of gods. The first is called Alalu, who reigns in heaven nine “years.”34 His future successor, Anu, is described as he who “bows down to his [Alalu’s] feet and puts the cups for drinking into his hand” (i.10-11).35 Although Anu (whose name derives from the Akkadianizecl form of the Sumerian god An, or ‘Sky’36) is not specifically identified as Alalu’s son, the fact that a god Alala is listed in a Babylonian god list as a father of Anu37 leaves no doubt as to the filial relationship here. In the ninth “year” of Alalu’s reign Anu rebels against him and either drives or hurls him “down to the dark earth” (1.12), the latter expression apparently referring to a subterranean region.38

The “Kingship in Heaven” Theme
Thus, Anu becomes the second “king in heaven.” But he, too, must cope with a rebellious offspring, the “mighty Kumarbi.”39 At first, Kumarbi is described as serving Anu in a manner identical to that in which the latter had served Alalu; however, like his father before him, Anu is only permitted to reign for nine “years,” and in the ninth “year” Kumarbi rebels. This time the elder god flees, but Kumarbi “took Anu by the feet and pulled him down from heaven” (i.23-24). Then follows a most interesting passage in light of our Greek “model”: “He [Kumarbi] bit his loins40 [so that] his manhood was
39The name Kumarbi is apparently Hurrian; cf. Giiterbock, MAW, p. 160, who points out that Kumarbi is frequently, although not consistently, equated with the great Sumero-Akkadian god Enlil. 40 The approximate meaning “his loins” or “his thighs” seems to fit the reading parsnussus which various Hittite scholars, including Giiterbock (personal com¬ munication, and MAW, p. 156), now prefer to the earlier emendational interpre¬ tation genussus “his knees” (cf. E. A. Hahn, JAOS 85:298-299 [1965]). In either case there is a euphemistic approximation for "male parts.” On the widespread sexual connotations of the knee Professor Jaan Puhvel has contributed the fol¬ lowing philological note: Hittite genu- means both ‘knee* and (secondarily) ‘[male] genitals’ (sometimes combined in anatomical lists with arras [= Old High German ars] ‘anus’; cf. J. Friedrich, "Einige hethitische Namen von Korperteilen,” IF 41:372-376 [1923]). This usage, however, is not a euphemism but has much more basic implications. Without having to delve deep into folkloristic and psychoanalytical records we find that “knee” is often an expression for sexual potency (cf., e.g., J. Laager, Geburt und Kindheit des Gottes in der griechischen Mythologie [Winterthur, 4957]• P' 136). As random examples we may refer to the passage in the Old Norse Floamannasaga where a man dreams of leeks (a well-known fertility symbol) growing from his knees (cf. W. P. Lehmann, Germanic Review 30:166 [1955]), and quote in translation these lines of Hesiod’s Works and Days about the “dog days” (582-587; imitated in a drinking song of Alcaeus [Oxford Book of Greek Verse, p. 170]): “But when the artichoke blooms and the chirping grass-hopper sits in a tree and pours down his shrill song continually from under his wings in the season of wearisome heat, then goats are plumpest and wine sweetest; women are most wanton, but men are feeblest, because Sirius parches head and KNEES.” In various Semitic languages (e.g., Akkadian, Ethiopic) b r k (Akkadian birku) means both ‘knee’ and ‘penis,’ and then more widely ‘strength,’ ‘family,’ or ‘tribe’ (cf. M. Cohen, “Genou, famille, force dans le domaine chamito-semitique,” Memorial Henri Basset [Paris, 1928], I, 203-210, and more generally W. Deonna, “Le genou, siege de force et de vie,” RA 13:224-235 [1939]). ‘Knee’ in the sense of ‘offspring,’ ‘family’ is commonly found in Indo-European and Finno-Ugric lan¬ guages: much as Akkadian tarbit birkiya means ‘nurseling of my birku,’ we have the synonymous Old Irish glun-daltae, ‘knee-nurseling’ (cf. J. Loth, “Le mot d&ignant le genou au sense de goncrat ion chez les Celtes, les Germains, les Slaves, les Assyriens,” RC 40:143-152 [1923]) and the Sogdian z'nwk’ z’tk, ‘knee-son’ (see E. Benveniste, BSL 27:51-53 [1926]). Similarly Old English cneow, Old Slavonic koleno, and Finnish polvi, ‘knee,’ also mean ‘offspring, generation.’ Some have claimed a connection between IE *genu, ‘knee,’ and the root *genon the basis of ancient evidence for childbearing labor in a kneeling position (e.g., R. Back, “Medizinisch-Sprachliches,” IF 40:162-167 [1922]; J. Klek, IF 44:79-80 [1927]; and S. Simonyi, “Knie und Geburt,” Zeitschrift fiir vergleichende Sprachforschung 50:152-154 [1922]). Yet in spite of the Hittite genzu, ‘lap,’ ‘female

absorbed in Kumarbi’s interior . . (i.25); compare Kronos’ emascu¬ lation of Ouranos. Indeed, the striking correspondences41 here be¬ tween Anu and Ouranos and between Kumarbi and Kronos have been noted frequently (see above). Subsequent to his deposition and emasculation, Anu informs Kumarbi that by “absorbing” his “manhood” he has been impreg¬ nated with five “heavy” divinities: the Weather-god (i.e., the Hur
rian Teshub),42 the river goddess Aranzah (i.e., Tigris),43 Tashmishu,44 who is destined to be the vizier of the gods, and two others whose names are not mentioned by Anu.45 Having thus addressed his successor, Anu “went up to heaven” and, after a visit to Nippur, perhaps to consult its chief deity Enlil about his pregnancy, Kumarbi becomes the third to occupy the heavenly throne. From here on the text is too fragmentary for a consecutive nar
genitals,’ metonymically ‘love,’ the root of Latin genus, gigno, Greek ykvos, yevvaco means primarily ‘beget,’ while other words are used for ‘bear’ (Latin parid, Greek tIktoi). Others have argued that in patriarchal society formal recognition of a newborn child on the father’s knee was the true means of legal affiliation or adoption, thus ‘birth’ in a juridical sense (cf., e.g., Old Norse knesetningr, ‘adopted son,’ and Homeric and Roman practices, and see Benveniste, op. cit., and M. Cahen, “ ‘Genou’, ‘adoption’, et ‘parente’ en germanique,” BSL 27:56-67 [1926]). In archaic Estonian the phrase lapse polvede peale tosttna, ‘lift a child on the knees,' is glossed with ‘ein Kind gehorig zur Welt bringen’ by F. Wiedemann, Ehstnisch-deutsches Worterbucli (2d ed.; St. Petersburg, 1893), p. 864, and polwile sama, ‘come on knees,’ is rendered by 'geboren werden’ (ibid.). Latin genuinus was similarly connected with genu, ‘knee,’ by A. Meillet (BSL 27:54-55 t1926]), and IE *gne-, ‘know, recognize,’ was brought into play, including the vexed question of its possible original affinity with *gen-, ‘beget’ (cf. yvqtrios ‘genuine’). The semantic tangle was further aggravated by R. Meringer (“Spitze, Winkel, Knie im urspriinglichen Denken,” Worter und Sachen 11:118-123 [192S]) and H. Guntert (ibid., pp. 124-142, esp. pp. 125-127), who tried to combine both Greek ydvv, ‘knee,’ and yeras, ‘chin,’ with yuvla, ‘angle.’ Even without reference to such inconclusive root etymologies, however, we have unraveled the semantic ramifications of the notion of ‘knee’ in many lan¬ guages as comprising ‘genitals,’ ‘potency,’ ‘offspring,’ ‘family,’ and ‘filiation.’ 41 Although both Ouranos and Anu are connected with the sky, we refer here of course to functional rather than linguistic correspondences. 42 Although the Hittite reading of the ideogram for weather-god is as yet unknown, it is highly probable that, given this and other contexts (cf. the Ullikummi texts), the Hittite deity in question can be none other than the Hurrian Weather- (or Storm-) god Teshub (cf. Goetze, ANET, p. 120; Giiterbock, Kumarbi, p. 35; id., “The Hittite Version of the Hurrian Kumarbi Myths,” p. 124 n. 14: id., MAW, p. 158); thus I follow Giiterbock and call the Hittite Weather-god by his Hurrian name. 43 Cf. Giiterbock, “The Hittite Version of the Hurrian Kumarbi Myths,” p. 124 n. 15. f 44 Ibid., n. 16. 1 45 From a reference in column ii it seems that these unmentioned divinities are Marduk (represented by a rare Sumerian name) and one whose name is written with the word sign KA.ZAL, ‘lust’; cf. Giiterbock, MAW, p. 158.

The "Kingship in Heaven” Theme
rative. It appears that Kumarbi attempts to avoid bearing these un¬ welcome offspring by spitting out Anu’s seed (end of col. i);46 never¬ theless, a fragmentary reference to Kumarbi’s failure to count months and the phrase “the ninth month came” clearly indicate that he car¬ ried Teshub et al. within him for a full term. Giiterbock47 points
out that the theme of the mutilated first part of column ii is child¬ birth and that two of the gods in Kumarbi’s “interior,” Marduk and KA.ZAL (see n. 45, above), discuss with him several ways in which they might be born. Especially miraculous is the birth of the Weathergod or Teshub48 (cf. the attention devoted by our Greek sources to
the birth of Zeus,48 to whom, as we shall see, Teshub corresponds in most respects). Then follows a passage that is especially interesting in
view of the equivalence between Kumarbi and Kronos. In it someone (Kumarbi?) says “give me the child ... I shall eat” (i.42); later there occurs the expression “Kumarbi begins to eat” (i.52), and prominent mention of the words “mouth” and “teeth” in connection with the
Weather-god. It seems that Teshub and his siblings are able to dethrone Kumarbi, for when we first meet the Weather-god he is already “king in heaven.” Just how the rebellion is accomplished is not quite clear. Is it possible that Earth, like her Greek counterpart, conspired with her offspring (if indeed they were such) to bring about Kumarbi’s downfall? Considering Earth’s probable connection with the birth of Teshub and his siblings, this is quite likely; perhaps we have here
a merging of Gaia and Rhea in the person of Earth. The second Hittite myth relevant to the theme in question is en¬ titled the “Song of Ullikummi” and contains many important paral¬
lels to the previously discussed Typhon story.50 Kumarbi, having been dethroned, has intercourse with a rock; from this unnatural union is produced the Stone-monster51 (also termed the Diorite after
43 Apparently Earth becomes pregnant thereby, although the names of the divinities she bears are unclear. 47 MAW, pp. 157-158. 48 Ibid., p. 158. 49 Cf. also the birth of Erichthonios: Hephaistos, desiring to wed a reluctant Athena, struggles with her, and in the course of this struggle his seed falls on the ground; Gaia is thus impregnated and in due time gives birth to Erichthonios (cf. Rose, op. cit., p. 110). 50 Text and translation published by Giiterbock, JCS 5:135-161 (1951), 6:8-42
(i952)51 There is an interesting counterpart to this in Phrygian mythology; cf. Arnobius, Adversus Nationes 5.55. Pausanias 7.17.10-12. Papas, the Phrygian “Zeus,” inseminates a rock called Agdos and begets Agdistis, an indolent her¬ maphrodite monster who, initially at least, is not unlike Ullikummi in some respects. The Phrygian monster, however, is castrated by the gods and thereby

the substance of which the monster is composed), or Ullikummi. Con¬ ceived by his father in order to avenge the latter’s overthrow, Ulli¬ kummi is destined to be a rebel against Teshub.52 That Typhon was born with a similar purpose in life can be seen from a passage in the Dionysiaca (2.565-568) wherein Kronides (an epithet of Zeus), after wounding the monster sorely, chides him saying: “A fine ally has old Kronos found in you, Typhoeus! ... A jolly champion of Titans!’ ” The young Ullikummi is placed on a shoulder of the Atlas-like Upelluri and allowed to grow: “In one day one yard he grew, but in
transformed into the mother-goddess figure Cybele. The blood produced by the castration causes a marvelous pomegranate or almond tree to spring up, and the fruit of this tree impregnates Nana, daughter of the river god Sangarios. Nana gives birth to Attis, who later castrates himself out of love for Cybele. Agdistis’ birth and early resemblance to Ullikummi may possibly indicate a relationship between the two traditions. Save for the castration motif, however, which might conceivably be implied in Ullikummi’s loss of power after being cut from Upelluri’s shoulder, the rest of the story does not have any clear Hittite parallels. 52 Ullikummi is not the only rebel to oppose Teshub’s power; there is also a text (Giiterbock, Kumarbi, pp. 10-13, Text 1; MAW, pp. 161-164) which describes the rebellion of a god known to us only by the highly ambiguous word sign ICAL (cf. Giiterbock, MAW, p. 161, who claims that neither the reading Sumerian LAMA, Akkadian LAMASSU, nor the Hittite reading Inara [an Anatolian god¬ dess; cf. the Illuyanka myth, MAW, p. 151] fits the context). This text presents some interesting, although not conclusive, parallels to the Greek myths concern¬ ing Prometheus and his defiance of Zeus. Unfortunately the KAL text (if indeed it is a separate text) is extremely fragmentary; the tablet is broken in such a way that we possess neither the beginning nor the final colophon that would indicate the name of the text and its exact relationship to the other two texts. Nevertheless, the events described almost certainly follow the ascension of Teshub; whether they precede or follow the Ullikummi affair is, however, much less certain. Unlike Prometheus, KAL actually seems to have assumed the kingship for a time, for when we first meet him he is described as taking “the reins and [the whip] out of the Storm-God’s [i.e., Teshub’s] hands” (i.18-19). Like Prometheus, however, and unlike Typhon and/or Ullikummi, KAL eventually submits. Ad¬ dressing the Weather-god as “my lord,” he is subjected to some form of bodily punishment involving mutilation; cf. the fate of Prometheus bound to a rock (or mountain) and continually mutilated by an eagle (Theogony 521). There are other aspects of KAL’s rebellion which also seem broadly similar to that of Prometheus. In the text, one of the chief objections raised against KAL is that he encourages mortals to be lax in their sacrificial duties: Ea, who apparently had appointed KAL to the kingship, later becomes dissatisfied with his protege’s conduct and claims that “ ‘just as he [KAL] himself is rebellious, so he has made the countries rebellious, and no one any longer gives bread or drink offerings to the gods’ ” (iii.18,40); Prometheus, too, is accused of encouraging humans to with¬ hold sacrificed food from the gods (cf. Theogony 535). While there seems to be no connection here between KAL and either the creation of mankind or man’s knowledge of fire;. the Hittite rebel can be seen to occupy a role broadly similar to that of Prometheus: a champion of mortals in their dealings with the gods. Furthermore, KAL’s downfall, like that of Prometheus, is apparently the result of a plot hatched by the gods and implemented by the chief god’s lieutenant (i.e., Teshub’s vizier Ninurta [MAW, p. 164]; cf. the role played in Prometheus’ punishment by Hephaistos [Theogony 520]).

Out of the water he stood, the Stone . . . , and the sea up to the place of the belt like a garment reached . . . ; he was lifted, the Stone, and up in Heaven the temples and the chamber he reached” (1.23-32). This can be compared to Nonnos’ description of Typhon cited earlier, that is, feet in water and head “crushed” against
the clouds. The first of the gods to see Ullikummi is the Sun-god, who reports his terrified observations to Teshub. The latter goes to see for
himself, and when he does so he weeps, for apparently he can see no way of overcoming this monster. His sister, Ishtar (Aranzah?) com¬ forts him and tries to enchant Ullikummi by music (cf. Kadmos’ charming of Typhoeus while recovering Zeus’s sinews [Dionysiaca
! .409-534]). Here, however, we learn that the Stone is deaf and blind. So Teshub decides to fight him, but to no avail, for the monster is too powerful. The gods retreat from this battle, fought in the shadow of Mount Hazzi (i.e., Mount Kasios on the Syrian coast), and retire to Kummiya,53 the city of Teshub. Ullikummi follows, endangering even Teshub’s wife Hebat. At this point Tashmishu enters the pic¬ ture. After climbing a tower to tell Hebat of her husband’s defeat,
he suggests to Teshub that they visit Ea,54 the Babylonian god of wisdom and witchcraft (cf. the Enuma-Elish, shortly to be discussed, wherein Ea occupies a prominent position), and together they journey to the wise god’s home in Apsuwa (the Babylonian Apsu).55 Ea, will¬ ing to help, first ascertains that Upelluri has no knowledge of what is resting on his shoulder and then orders the “former gods” (i.e., those who ruled in heaven before Alalu, such as Enlil, the Sumerian storm-god) to produce the “ancient tool” (a sickle?) used at one time to separate Earth and Heaven. With this tool Ea cuts Ullikummi from Upelluri’s shoulder and thus magically renders him powerless.56 Here, too, we have a parallel to the Greek tradition, for Apollodorus, as we have seen, described the use of a cutting tool (i.e., the “adamantine sickle”) by Zeus in his struggle with Typhon. The same tool, of course, was used against Ouranos by Kronos, and some authorities,
53 Apparently located in the mountains of southeast Anatolia; Giiterbock suggests (MA W, p. 166) that the name Ullikummi itself simply means "Destroyer of Kummiya.” 54 Giiterbock, “The Hittite Version of the Hurrian Kumarbi Myths,” p. 129. In col. iii.19—22 there is the suggestion that Anu wants to make Ea king instead of Teshub; cf. P. Meriggi, “I miti di Kumarpi, il Kronos Currico,” Athenaeum 31:101-157 (1953). 55 Giiterbock, op. cit. 66 ibid.

both ancient and modern, have interpreted the castration of Ouranos as a symbolic separation of heaven and earth.57 It is interesting that the Hittites preserve a tradition of a primeval cutting tool once used to separate heaven and earth, and which must later be used to defeat Ullikummi, although no specific tool is mentioned in the account of Anu’s castration. Perhaps in the latter case the teeth of Kumarbi have been substituted for the stone “teeth” of a neolithic sickle (i.e., the “ancient cutting tool”).
When word reaches the gods that Ullikummi has been rendered powerless, they join together under the leadership of Teshub and
attack the monster. From here on the text is unreadable; however, we may assume with Giiterbock58 that Teshub and his fellows are ultimately victorious. For it appears that here, as in the Greek tra¬ dition, the new “king in heaven” must meet this final challenger so as to validate his position as perpetual ruler, and there is no doubt that Teshub, like Zeus, is able to accomplish this validation. It should be noted, though, that the conflict here is much more general than in the Greek tradition. Perhaps in the conflict between Teshub and Ullikummi we have a merger of the Titanomachia and the Typhon fight.
THE PHOENICIAN VERSION
In the Phoenician History of Herennios Philo of Byblos, known only through the works of Eusebius (Praeparatio Evangelica) and Porphyrius (De Abstinentia), is contained a version of the “Kingship in Heaven” which closely parallel's the two just discussed, a version that has often been regarded as an intermediary between those of the Hittites and the Greeks. Philo’s date is uncertain, although the best evidence leads me to believe that he wrote during the latter half of the first century a.d.; Clemen places his birth in the last years of the reign of the Emperor Claudius.59 Claiming to have obtained his information from the works of a certain Sanchunjathon, a Phoenician scholar who, he asserts, “lived before the Trojan War,” Philo at¬ tempts to reconstruct the “history” of his city and to trace the origins of its gods. He begins by outlining a four-generational sequence of “kings in heaven,” all of whom are intimately associated with the city of Byblos and its environs.
According to Philo, the first “king in heaven” is named Eliun (or
57 W. Staudach&, Die Trennung von Himmel und Erde (Tubingen, 1942), pp. 61 f. 58 Giiterbock, op. cit., p. 130. 59 Clemen, op. cit., p. 2.

Hypsistos “Highest”) (I.14),60 who with his wife Bruth (i.e., Beirut) comes to live in Byblos. They give birth to a son called Ouranos and a daughter named Ge or Gaia. Ge and Ouranos marry and produce four sons: El (who is also referred to as Kronos), Baitylos, Dagon, and Atlas (1.16). A quarrel ensues between Ouranos and his wife, and El (or Kronos) and his siblings side with their mother. Ouranos then tries to destroy his rebellious offspring, but El, on the advice of Hermes, whom he has taken as a counselor, forges a sickle (or spear?) and with it drives out his father. El then becomes “king in heaven” (or at least in Byblos), but turns out to be a bad ruler, casting out his brother Atlas and murdering a son and a daughter. Meanwhile, Ouranos has fled unharmed. He sends Rhea, Astarte, and Dione, his young daughters, to plead his case before El. These three El takes to wife,61 and by each he produces a number of children. The most important of these is Baal62 (or Baaltis), who succeeds him.
Thirty-two years later, El lures his father back to Byblos, into an ambush, and castrates him (cf. Theog. 175). Thus, the castration theme is present, although it does not accompany the deposition of the “Heaven figure” as it does in the Greek and Hittite-Hurrian ver¬ sions. Furthermore, what appears to me to be a crucial element is lacking here: the idea that castration is a necessary step in reducing the power of the Heaven figure. In Philo it seems but an afterthought. Castration figures again in Philo’s account, although this time it is self-inflicted. For some obscure reason El mutilates himself thirtytwo years after so altering his father.
Finally, the fourth generation (in the person of Baal) takes over the heavenly kingship. This transfer of power is apparently made without much conflict, an occurrence unique in the distribution of the theme. Typhon is mentioned by Philo along with the children of El, but there is no mention of a fight.63 Moreover, the role of the “Zeus figure” (Baal) is minor when compared with that played by him in the Greek and Hittite-Hurrian versions, and in the Iranian, Norse, and Babylonian versions as well.
60 The numbers enclosed by parentheses refer to lines in the original text of the Phoenician History; the translation is by Clemen. 61 There is a close parallel to this in the Iranian tradition wherein the “Kronos figure” Zohak marries two of Jamshid’s sisters after deposing him. See Wikander, “Hethitiska my ter hos greker och perser,” p. 52. 62 Cf. the relationship between El and Hadad, the god of thunder and lightning, as delineated in the Ras Shamra texts. The association of Baal and Hadad has long been recognized in the Caananitic tradition; cf. W. F. Albright, Archaeology and the Religion of Israel (Baltimore, 1946), pp. 72-74; S. H. Hooke, Middle Eastern Mythology (Harmondsworth, 1963), pp. 86-87. 63 Clemen, op. cit., p. 28.



102 C. Scott Littleton
In view of its late date and the high probability that its author was thoroughly familiar with Hesiod, many scholars have been skep¬ tical of this Phoenician “Theogony,” labeling it a poor attempt at syncretism. The discovery of some Hurrian texts at Ras Slramra, how¬ ever, wherein the double name El-Kumarbi occurs,64 has thrown a new light on the matter. As El is clearly identified by Philo with Kronos, it is reasonable to infer that there was some sort of a KronosEl-Kumarbi syncretism present in northern Syria, at least, as early as 1400 b.c. If this is correct, then it is also quite reasonable to infer with Giiterbock that the Phoenician tradition here forms a link be¬ tween the Hittite-Hurrian version and the later Greek version, and that what formerly appeared as rank syncretism on Philo’s part can now be seen as antedating rather than reflecting the Hesiodic version
of the theme.85 But there still remain other possibilities. That the Phoenicians un¬ doubtedly received elements of the Kumarbi myth from the Hittites
as the latter expanded their empire after 1500 b.c. is not ques¬ tioned here; indeed, the Ras Shamra evidence renders it almost cer¬ tain. What is questioned, however, is the assumption that the Phoe¬ nicians were necessarily the link in a chain of diffusion from northern
Syria to Greece. There is always the possibility that the theme reached Hesiod and/or his immediate sources directly from the HittiteHurrian region. This alternative is enhanced somewhat by L. R. Palmer’s assertion66 that the Luvians, first cousins to the Hittites, invaded the Peloponnesus and Crete at the beginning of the second millennium b.c., and that the first speakers of Greek arrived several centuries later. If Palmer is correct in this assertion, and there is good reason to believe that he is, then it is remotely possible that the “Kingship in Heaven’’ theme was taken over by the Greeks along with other aspects of Luvian culture.67 Another possibility, that the theme was borrowed directly from Babylonia during Mycenaean times, is dis¬ cussed presently.
THE IRANIAN VERSION
It was Stig Wikander who, in 1951,68 first demonstrated the presence of the “Kingship in Heaven”—if indeed the term “heaven” is appli
64 Giiterbock, “The Hittite Version o£ the Hurrian Kumarbi Myths,” p. 133. 65 A further argument against interpreting Philo wholly in syncretistic terms is that he preserves a “pre-Ouranos” figure, i.e., Eliun; cf. the position of Alalu in the Hurrian-Hitfite version. 66 L. R. Palmer, Mycenaeans and Minoans (2d ed.; London, 1965). 67 Palmer (ibid.) suggests that the name Parnassos is derived from a Luvian form meaning ‘place of the temple’ (Luvian parna-, ‘temple,’ plus the suffix -ass¬ denoting appurtenance). 66 “Hethitiska myter hos greker och perser.”

cable in this instance—in the Iranian tradition. Bypassing the more ancient and mythological Avestan literature, Wikander pointed out
that a threefold set of royal usurpers similar to those present in the Greek, Hittite-Hurrian, and Phoenician traditions occupies a promi¬ nent position in Firdausi’s Shahndmeh, which was composed about a.d. 976. Despite its relatively recent date and the high probability that its author was familiar with Greek myth, the Shahndmeh has long been recognized as a repository of popular traditions not else¬ where represented in Iranian literature. This would certainly appear to be true as far as the theme in question is concerned.
In any event, the three Iranian kings cited by Wikander as com¬ parable with Ouranos, Kronos, Zeus, et al., are Jamshid, Zohak, and Feridun, who occupy, respectively, positions four, five, and six in Firdausi’s king list. Jamshid is preceded by three relatively indis¬ tinct figures, Kaiumers (equals Gayomart in the Avesta), Husheng, and Tahumers. These three do not seem to be related to their suc¬ cessors in any important sense—J amshid is made the son of Tahumers, but little else is said about the relationship between them. Thus it is Jamshid who occupies the Ouranos-like position, despite his lack
of an autochthonous or truly divine origin. Jamshid, whose name corresponds to that of Yima Xsaeta69 in the Avesta, is said to have ruled for some seven hundred years, and the early portion of this reign is described as a sort of Golden Age, when men were at peace with one another and the land was bountiful.
But this state of affairs did not last. “Then it came about that the heart of Jamshid was uplifted with pride, and he forgot whence came his weal and the source of his blessings.”70 Wikander, in dis¬ cussing the position of Jamshid, notes that he “rfegne d’abord sur une humanite heureuse, mais il commet ensuite le premier peche, ce qui amene la perte de la Gloire Royale et sa chute.”71 Wikander also remarks that some texts show Jamshid as having been deceived by “une figure feminine qui aurait inspire ses transgressions et caus£ sa chute.”72 Thus, we have some indication that here, too, there is a Gaia-like figure somewhere in the background.73 Jamshid is eventually overthrown by Zohak (equals Azi Dahaka in the Avesta), who in terms of our model occupies an ambiguous position. He is at once Typhon and Kronos. Both in his physical ap

pearance and in his relationship with the third member of the trio, Feridun, who occupies the position of Zeus figure, Zoliak strongly resembles Typhon. Yet he enters the epic occupying the position of a Kronos figure. Like Typhon, his physical appearance is character¬ ized by the presence of snakes growing from his shoulders;74 yet he is the one who overthrows Jamshid and who commits the inevitable act of mutilation, although in this instance it is not castration but
rather a sawing in half.75 There are two interesting parallels here to the Phoenician version. Like El, Zohak waits a hundred years before mutilating his deposed enemy: “in the hundredth year [after his overthrow] the impious shah [Jamshid] appeared one day beside the Sea of Chin. Zohak clutched him forthwith, gave him no respite, and, sawing him asunder, freed the world from him and the fear that he inspired.”76 A second paral¬ lel can be seen in the fact that Zohak, like El, marries two sisters who stand in close kinship to him—only in this instance they are sisters of the deposed first-generation ruler (Jamshid). Wikander emphasizes the similarity between the saw that cut Jamshid in half and the sickle that castrated Ouranos. “Azdahak ou un autre ennemi le mutile avec une ‘scie’ . . . cette ‘scie’ est evidemment identique a la ‘serpe aux dents aigues’ d’Hesiode.”77 He also characterizes Zohak as the “neveu” of Jamshid, although no¬ where in our reading of the epic is there any clear-cut statement as to the relationship, if any, between the two figures. Zohak is charac¬ terized simply as the son of an Arabian king78 who is invited to come
to Iran and replace Jamshid. Zohak, in his turn, is overthrown by the grandson of Jamshid, Feridun (equals Thraetaona in the Avesta), who, like Zeus, has a marvelous childhood. Again we see the theme of the mother hiding away the child from the wrath of the father (in this case Zohak). Zohak, it seems, while having no offspring of his own, has an insati¬ able desire to consume human beings. Furthermore, the serpent-king dreams that Feridun will someday overcome him (cf. Kronos’ fore¬ knowledge of Zeus’s coming, and his subsequent swallowing of his
offspring), and on the basis of this dream “bade the world be scoured
74 Cf. J. Atkinson. The Sha Nameh of the Persian Poet Firdausi (London, 1832), p. 34. 75 Atkinson (ibid.) asserts that Jamshid was laid between two planks and sawed lengthwise; see glso A. Warner and E. Warner, The Shahnama of Firdausi (Lon' don, 1905), p. 140. 76 Ibid. 77 Wikander, “Histoire des Ouranides,” p. 13. 78 Warner and Warner, op. cit., p. 142; cf. Wikander, "Histoire des Ouranides,” p. 7, Levy, op. cit., p. xvii.
The “Kingship in Heaven” Theme 105
for Feridun.”79 Feridun’s mother first places him in the care of a wondrous cow, Purmaieli, who suckles the infant. Then, fearing that Zohak will find this hiding place, she removes him to the care of a shepherd “on the Mount Alberz” (i.e., the Elbruz?), who raises him to manhood. Here we can compare the hiding away of Zeus on Mount Ida (or Aigaion). Finally, Feridun grows to manhood and sets out to overcome his monstrous enemy. Instead of a cutting instrument,
Feridun uses a club, the head of which is shaped like a cow—in memory of Purmaieh.80 The combat between Feridun and Zohak
is strongly reminiscent of the conflict between Zeus and Typhon. Again, it is a single-combat situation, not the type of group action
which dethroned Kronos. Feridun overpowers Zohak but does not actually kill him (a fusion, perhaps, of the Typhon and Kronos motifs); rather, he chains the monster to a rock81 on Mount Demawend(?), and Zohak eventually dies of exposure. After this deed is accomplished, Feridun reigns as
king, if not actually “in heaven,” then certainly as a divine king
in Iran. While it is certain that the Avestan names Yima Xsaeta, Azi Dahaka, and Thraetaona correspond, respectively, to Jamshid,
Zohak, and Feridun, the only clear thematic parallels between the two sets of figures are that both Yima and Jamshid can be seen to be in one respect or another primordial (although both do actually have forebears), that both were “Golden Age” rulers who “sinned,” that Azi Dahaka and his later namesake share draconic character¬ istics, and that both are rendered harmless, respectively, by Thrae¬ taona and Feridun. Even in the latter instance there is an important difference. Thraetaona is characterized as the “smiter” of Azi Da¬ haka,82 while Feridun, as we have seen, imprisons Zohak. Thus it can be safely asserted that the theme qua theme, despite some simi¬
larities, is not present in the Avesta. Nor is it to be found in the Indie tradition. To be sure, there are some very general parallels, both thematic and philological, between the Avestan figures mentioned above and some of the dramatis per¬ sonae of the Inclic literature. For example, Avestan Yima parallels Vedic Yama; Azi Dahaka is equivalent to the three-headed monster
79 Zimmern, op. cit., p. 8. 80 Ibid., p. 12. 81 Or imprisons him in a cave; cf. Wikander, “Hethitiska myter hos greker och perser,” p. 47. 82 Warner and Warner, op. cit., p. 171; the Warners suggest (p. 174) that Feridun is actually a coalescence of two Avestan figures, Thraetaona and Thrita (cf. Yasna 9.21-30).

Vrtra; Thraetaona bears a resemblance to Trita Aptya, the slayer of
Vytra (also to Indra in this context); and the cow-headed weapon (.gurz) used by Feridun is linguistically cognate to the thunderbolt vajra used in the slaying of Vrtra. But other than these isolated cor¬ respondences, together with one other possibility to be mentioned shortly in connection with the Norse version, there is no evidence for
the presence of the theme in question in the Veda’s, Mahabharata, and so on.83 This negative evidence, so to speak, is a most important matter when it comes to the question of possible Indo-European
origins, and I return to it later on.
THE NORSE VERSION
All too often there is a tendency among students of comparative mythology to equate “Norse” with “Germanic,” to assume that the materials contained in the Edda’s, Heimskringla, Gesta Danorum,
and the like, are a true reflection of common Germanic religious beliefs and practices. To make such an equation is, of course, an error; for it is abundantly clear that there were differences in re¬ ligious outlook among the several branches of the Germanic-speaking
peoples. One need only compare Tacitus with Saxo Grammaticus to see examples of these differences. While there are some common figures (e.g., *TIwaz, probable prototype of Norse Tyr, Anglo-Saxon
Tiw, and perhaps the figure reflected in Tacitus’ Tuisto),84 any at¬ tempt to draw general conclusions about the nature of Germanic religion from any one region or era must be made cautiously. Yet, when it comes to cosmogonic and theogonic matters we are necessarily limited to a single region and a single era: Scandinavia (primarily Iceland) in the eleventh and twelfth centuries a.d. More¬ over, our chief sources,85 the Elder or Poetic Edda, attributed to Saemund Siggfusson, and especially the Younger, or Prose Edda of Snorri Sturluson, were composed at a time when the old religion was fast giving way to Christianity (Snorri approaches his subject from an explicitly Christian standpoint), and the extent to which
*3 For a discussion of the possible Vedic parallels here, see Wikander, "Hethitiska myter hos greker och perser,” esp. p. 46. 84 Tuisto can be interpreted as meaning ‘Twin’; cf. Ymir, possibly cognate with Yama, and Tacitus’ Mannus, whom he combines with Tuisto and who belongs etymologically with Manu; for a discussion of Tuisto and Mannus see H. R. Ellis Davidson, Godstand Myths of Northern Europe (Harmondsworth, 1964), pp. 5461, 196-199; E. O. G. Turville-Petre, Myth and Religion of the North (London, 1964), esp. p. 7. 85 The translations utilized are by Lee M. Hollander, The Poetic Edda (Austin, 1928), and Jean Young, The Prose Edda (Cambridge, 1954).
The “Kingship in Heaven” Theme 107
non-Norse materials were interwoven with the native tradition is
still not wholly clear. That Saemund and Snorri were aware—albeit dimly—of the mythic traditions of the eastern Mediterranean is entirely possible.86 It is also possible that whatever parallels may exist between their accounts of the creation and those previously discussed in this paper are wholly or partially the result of independent invention. In any case, all the foregoing must be kept firmly in mind as we proceed to a brief ex¬ amination of the Norse theogony to see if it contains materials rele¬
vant to the “Kingship in Heaven.” In the beginning was Ginnungagap (equivalent to the Greek Chaos), which can be loosely translated as “yawning void.” Out of this yawning void were created initially two regions: Muspellheim on the south (i.e., a “Land of Fire”) and Niflheim on the north (i.e., a “Land of Mist”). Ice crystals combined with sparks, and out of this combination there was created the first being, called Ymir. Ymir, defined as a giant of enormous proportions, lies down and sleeps. While he sleeps two things happen: first, a second autochthonous creature appears, a cow named Audhumla. While Ymir sleeps the cow nourishes him, at the same time she licks the salty ice and slowly uncovers first the hair, then the body of a third autochthon: Buri.
Thus Audhumla serves as a link between these two generationally equivalent Jontin, or “Giants” (occasionally rendered Etin). Mean¬
while, in his sleep, Ymir androgynously gives birth to several off¬ spring (Lay of Vafthrudnir 33): “The ice-etin’s [i.e., Ymir’s] strong
arms, beneath there grew both girl and boy, one with the other, the wise etin’s shanks begat a six-headed son.” The latter is named Thrudgelmir. He, in turn, gives birth to the crafty Bergelmir. Thus,
we have one three-generation line of descent from Ymir. As the Lay of Vafthrudnir (29) has it: “Ages before the earth was made, Bergel¬ mir came to be. Thrudgelmir was that thur’s(?) father. But Aurgelmir [i.e., Orgelmir, or Ymir] oldest of all.” A second three-generational line descends from Buri, who, after
emerging from the ice, produces a son: Bor. Bor marries a giantess named Bestla (one of Ymir’s offspring?). They, in turn, produce three sons: Odin, Vili, and V6 (cf. Zeus, Poseidon, Hades). Odin and his siblings (who, unlike their Greek equivalents, become shadowy fig¬ ures very quickly) are the first of the Aesir (or “Gods” as opposed to “Giants”). Their first act is to overthrow Ymir, and with him Thrud

gelmir. Bergelmir they banish (or he escapes) to subterranean Jontinheim (cf. Tartaros?).87 Ymir they cut up (the tool involved is not mentioned), forming the world: “of Ymir’s flesh the earth was shaped, of his blood the briny sea, of his hair, the trees, the hills of his bones, out of his skull the sky” (Lay of Grimnir 40). There is a parallel to this in Rig-Veda io.go, wherein India and others create the world from the flesh and bones of the giant Purusa. Another parallel can be seen in the Babylonian Enuma-Elish, in the use to which Marduk puts the body of the slain Tiamat. The similar¬
ities here, however, may best be explained in terms of a common folkloristic motif which has nothing specifically to do with the theme under discussion. Yet the fact that Odin and his siblings cut the primeval figure is significant. It is this feature, rather than the sub¬ sequent use of his remains, that is relevant for our purposes. In any event, it is only after the Jontin have been defeated that Odin and his brothers create mankind.88 This, of course, is paral¬ leled in the Greek version (i.e., the human race is only created after
the final defeat of the Titans; cf. Bibliotheca 1.4.1). It is our contention that the events just described contain all the essential ingredients of the “Kingship in Heaven” theme: First, there is a three-generational line of descent (although bifurcated); second, there is the mutilation of the first-generation “king” (i.e., Odin’s
cutting up Ymir); third, there is the banishment of a descendant of this first-generation being by one who has usurped power from him (Bergelmir is the logical inheritor of Ymir); fourth, the final and per¬ petual holder of power (Odin) is, together with his siblings and off¬ spring, defined as an altogether different sort of supernatural being (i.e., “Gods” or Aesir, as opposed to “Giants” or Jontin; cf. the Greek distinction between “God” and “Titan”). And finally, there is a battle between these Aesir and the Giants, a battle that seems to be
87 In the Gylfaginning Snorri describes Bergelmir’s flight as occurring in the context of a universal flood created from the blood that gushed from Ymir after his demise. As this is the only clear reference to a flood in Norse myth, it seems reasonable to infer that Snorri, as a Christian, felt the need of it. This is under¬ scored by the etymology of the word lu&r, used by him to refer to the “boat” in which Bergelmir and his wife survive the deluge. Although Snorri clearly uses the word in the context of “boat,” earlier usages of the term (cf. Lay of Vafthrudnir 35) would seem to indicate that it meant ‘coffin’ or ‘bier.’ See E. O. G. Turville-Petre, “Prof. Dumezil and the Literature of Iceland,” Hommages a Georges Dumezi( (Brussels, i960), pp. 211-212; see also H. Petersson, “Aisl. ludr ‘Trog usw,’ ” IF 124:267-269 (1909), who asserts that the basic meaning here is ‘hollowed tree trunk’ and proposes a derivation from Indo-European *lu-trd(cf. Skt. lunati, ‘cut, clip’). 88 I.e., askr, ‘ash,’ and embla, ‘elm,’ respectively, the first man and woman.
The “Kingship in Heaven” Theme 109
equivalent to that between the Olympians and the Titans89 (or
Giants, too, for that matter). That the characteristic structure of the theme, as expressed in the Greek and Hittite-Hurrian tradition, is absent, must be admitted. Contained within a broad three-generational framework, however,
most of the significant components of this structure are present. To put it another way, the same broad configuration is present in Norse mythology, yet the elements within this configuration are not for the most part structured as they are in the Greek tradition. Indeed, we have seen other cases, generally held to be part of the theme in question, which also deviate from this typological structure, yet which maintain the same broad configuration. We may cite here the Iranian version, wherein Zohak, who most clearly resembles Typhon,
appears in the role of a Kronos figure. We may also cite the Phoe¬ nician case, wherein Baal does not have to fight his way to power, as is characteristic of the other versions—including the Norse. It seems fair to assert that the Norse, like the Greeks, Hittites, Hurrians, Phoenicians, Iranians, and Babylonians, knew the “Kingship in Heaven” theme. Whether its presence here can best be explained in terms of diffusion or independent invention is still a moot point, although I believe that the former possibility is the more probable in view of the extremely late periods from which the primary sources date. There is, of course, the alternate possibility that the presence of the theme can be explained in terms of a common Indo-European heritage. Once again, let me defer consideration of this possibilityseemingly quite remote—until I look at the Babylonian versions.
THE BABYLONIAN VERSIONS
Like the Norse version, the two Babylonian versions deviate in a number of important respects from that which for convenience sake I have labeled the typological version (i.e., that of the Greeks). Yet these two related accounts of how the gods came to be may well prove to be far closer to the source of the theme in question than any previously considered. Although no extant text of the Enuma-Elish is earlier than 1000 b.c., internal evidence alone indicates that its composition probably dates at least from the Old Babylonian period,
891 am not the first to make such an observation. Well over a century ago Jakob Grimm, in his Teutonic Mythology (translated from the German by J. S. Stallybrass [London, 1883], II, 275), had occasion to observe that “As the Edda has a Buri and Borr before Odinn, so do Uranus and Kronus here come before Zeus; with Zeus and Odinn begins the race of gods proper, and Poseidon and Hades complete the fraternal trio, like Vili and Ve. The enmity of gods and titans is therefore that of ases [Aesir] and giants . . . .”



110 C. Scott Littleton
that is, the early part of the second millennium b.c., and that its
content may be considerably older.90 The Enuma-Elish begins with an account of the primeval state of things: “When on high the heaven had not been named,/Firm ground below had not been called by name,/Naught but prime¬ val Apsu,91 their begetter,/(And) Mummu-Tiamat,92 she who bore them all,/Their waters commingling as a single body . . (i.1-4).93
We see here the by now familiar pair of autochthons, in this instance defined as fresh and salt water. From this union several generations
of divinities are born, including the figures (for our purposes obscure) Lahmu and Lahamu, Anshar and Kishar, and Anu. Finally, there appears the figure who, together with another shortly to be discussed, occupies the Kronos position, the “all-wise” Ea (or Nudimmud; cf. Sumerian Enki). Although the exact parentage and birth order of Ea are obscure, by all indications he is the youngest of the lot (who can, for our purposes, be reckoned as a single generation; that is, they band together and act as a generational unit).94 If this inter¬
pretation is correct, then there is an interesting parallel here to the ultimogeniture pattern so clearly evident in the Greek version. Under the apparent leadership of Ea, the gods of what we may term the second generation (see above) “disturbed Tiamat as they surged back and forth” (i.22). Apsu, too, is annoyed by “their hilar¬ ity in the Abode of Heaven” (i.24) and decides to do away with them. His decision is strengthened by the advice of the vizier Mummu,95 but is opposed by Tiamat, who counsels forgiveness. Nevertheless, the gods discover Apsu’s intentions. After putting Apsu to sleep with an incantation (cf. the “deep suggestions” with which Zeus be¬ guiles Kronos96), Ea slays him, yet before doing so he tears off the
90 E. A. Speiser, "Akkadian Myths and Epics,” ANET, p. 60. It should be noted, however, that P. Walcot (Hesiod and the Near East [Cardiff, 1966], p. 33), suggests that the rise o£ Marduk to supremacy among the gods of Mesopotamia was quite late and that the Enuma-Elish as we know it was most likely composed around 1100 b.c. He thus concludes that “In terms of chronology, Enuma Elish now seems to stand between the Hattusas tablets and the Theogony-” Nevertheless, this would not preclude earlier Babylonian and/or Sumerian prototypes wherein some other god played the part of Marduk. 91 Sumerian Abzu; see S. N. Kramer, “Mythology of Sumer and Akkad,” MAW, p. 120. 92I.e., “Mother” Tiamat; see Speiser, op. cit., p. 61. 93 The translation of the Enuma-Elish utilized here is that of Speiser, ANET,
pp. 61-72. 94 Cf. i.52, wherein Apsu plots “against the gods, his sons”; i.56, wherein Apsu’s intentions are made known “unto the gods, their first-born." 95 Not to be confused with the epithet of Tiamat; cf. i.4 and n. 92, above. 96 See Walcot, op. cit., p. 34.
The “Kingship in Heaven” Theme m
former’s tiara or halo (symbolic, perhaps, of sovereignty and the masculine vigor that accompanies it) and puts it on himself (i.60-69). Admittedly, I may be guilty of overinterpretation here, but it does occur to me that the act of tearing off Apsu’s tiara is comparable with an act of castration. By so doing, Ea clearly renders his forbear pow¬ erless to resist, just as Kronos, Kumarbi, et al. render their progeni¬ tors powerless by dismembering or “biting” them. In any event, thus passes the first generation.
After having become “king in heaven” Ea97 takes up residence upon the dead Apsu98 and is joined by his wife Damkina. In time Damkina gives birth to the great Babylonian divinity Marduk, who is patently the Zeus figure in this version. Many lines follow describing Marduk’s brilliance and prowess, for example, “He was the loftiest of the gods, surpassing was his stature,/His members were enormous, he was exceeding tall” (i.97—100). Meanwhile, Tiamat schemes in order to seek revenge for the slaying of her husband. She causes a
heretofore unmentionecl god, Ea’s half-brother, Kingu, to be elevated to command of the Assembly of the Gods, apparently, though the text makes no mention of it, displacing Ea. She then sets about cre¬ ating a host of monsters (cf. i.126). From this point on Ea fades into obscurity, and the threat presented by Tiamat and Kingu is met by Marduk. A great fight ensues. Marduk eventually slays Tiamat
in single combat and destroys her host. He then captures the rebel Kingu and consigns him to Uggae, the god of the dead (iv.i 19-120). Afterward, Marduk and Ea create heaven and earth from Tiamat’s inflated body by splitting it in two99 (cf. the fate of Ymir). Marduk now reigns perpetually as “king in heaven.”100 He has validated his claim to sovereignty by emerging victorious in the epic duel with Tiamat.
Taken as a whole, the Enuma-Elish presents some remarkable parallels to the other versions of the “Kingship in Heaven,” although
97 M. L. West, in the “Prolegomena” to Hesiod: Theogony (Oxford, 1966), p. 23, asserts that Ea’s elder sibling (or grandfather) Anshar assumes the kingship. Nowhere in the text is this clearly evident. The only passage that may possibly reflect such a royal status is iii.i ff., wherein Anshar sends a message to Lahmu and Lahamu via “Gaga, his vizir” (italics mine). Otherwise, Anshar appears as but one of the siblings (or forebears) of Ea who plays a prominent albeit essentially sup¬ porting role in the deposition of Apsu and the subsequent conflict with Tiamat. 98There is some confusion here. Kramer suggests (MAW, p. 121) that Ea actually takes up residence upon Apsu’s corpse. The text itself would seem to indicate that Ea names his place of residence (i.e., the location of his “cult hut”; cf. i.77) after his deceased parent. 99Cf. Kramer, MAW, p. 121. 100 “He took from him [i.e., Kingu] the Tablets of Fate, not rightfully his, sealed [them] with a seal and fastened [them] on his breast" (iv.121-122).



112 G. Scott Littleton
there are, of course, several important structural differences. For one thing, there is a bifurcation of the Kronos figure. Taken together, the careers of Ea and Kingu approximate closely that of the typical second generation “king”: initially, in the person of Ea, we see him usurping the kingship through a ruse and (perhaps) performing an act of emasculation; later on, in the person of Kingu, we see him de¬ feated by the Zeus figure and consigned to what would appear to be
a Tartaros-like place. In the case of Tiamat we have not bifurca¬ tion but fusion. She is at once Gaia and Typhon (cf. Zohak, who is both Kronos and Typhon). It is in the latter role, however, that she appears most clearly, and the fight between her and Marduk is strikingly similar to that between Zeus and Typhon, Teshub and Ullikummi, and so on. The relationship between Tiamat and Kingu
is, of course, the opposite of that between Kronos and Typhon or Kumarbi and Ullikummi: in the Babylonian account the “king” is a creature of the monster. Yet on balance it seems clear that the theogony contained in the Enuma-Elish is akin to those we have previously surveyed. And given its date, it is probably their proto
type. Until recently, the Enuma-Elish was the only known Babylonian creation myth that came anywhere near to approximating the idea of the divine kingship. In 1965, however, W. G. Lambert published (with A. R. Millard) and subsequently translated101 a cuneiform text (BM 74329) which may be termed for convenience’ sake the “Theo¬ gony of Dunnu.”102 In it we can see essentially the same course of events as described in the Enuma-Elish, although the locale and figures involved are for the most part quite distinct. The date of this new text is late. Lambert and Walcot assign it to the Late Baby¬ lonian period (i.e., between 635 and 330 b.c.), altough it is suggested that it belongs to the earlier phase of this period and that, as in the case of the Enuma-Elish, it may contain materials originally com¬ posed perhaps as early as the beginning of the second millennium B.C.103 Here the action centers on the ancient city of Dunnu, an otherwise obscure place as far as the overall Babylonian tradition is con¬ cerned.104 The text itself is far shorter and more literary than the one
l°l W. G. Lambert and P. Walcot, “A New Babylonian Theogony and Hesiod,” Kadmos 4:64-72 (1965). It should be pointed out that Walcot is responsible for the appended (.“classical commentary” (pp. 68-72); the translation and accom¬ panying commentary are by Lambert. 102 I should emphasize that this is my term, not that of Lambert and Walcot. 103 Lambert and Walcot, op. cit., p. 64. 104 Ibid., pp. 67-68.
The “Kingship in Heaven” Theme 113
just discussed. In this instance the two autochthons are the figures Hain (unknown outside this text)105 and Earth. Although the first three lines are incomplete, it appears that they give birth first to Sea (cf. Tiamat) by means of a plow, and then in an apparently more normal fashion to the male figure Amakandu (once again we en¬ counter the ultimogeniture pattern). Amakandu is seduced by his mother: “[Earth] cast her eyes on Amakandu, her son,/‘Come, let me make love to you’ she said to him” (lines 8-9). After marrying his mother, Amakandu slays Hain and lays him to rest in the city of Dunnu, “which he loved” (line 12). He then assumes his father’s overlordsliip of the city (line 13). Subsequently, Amakandu marries
Sea (his sister: cf. Kronos and Rhea), who gives birth to a son called Lahar. Lahar in turn slays his father, marries his mother (i.e.. Sea),
and assumes the kingship. He, too, produces offspring: a daughter. River, and a son, whose first name is unreadable. The latter even¬ tually kills both Lahar and Sea (his mother), marries River (his sister), and assumes power. At this point the text is somewhat obliterated, but the pattern seems to be carried out for at least two more genera¬ tions. Sons slay their fathers and mothers, marry their sisters, and usurp the sovereignty. The female figures here whose names are readable include Ga’um and Ningeshtinna. There is no clear termi¬ nation to the text, which is contained on the obverse and reverse of a
single tablet, although the last readable line (40) indicates that the seat of power has been transferred to the city of Shupat [or Kupat].
In this “Theogony of Dunnu” can be seen in abbreviated and somewhat redundant form the essential outlines of the theme. The fact that there are five generations rather than three is not a crucial deterrent to putting the text into comparison with the other versions. It will be recalled that both the Hittite-Hurrian version and that of the Phoenicians, to say nothing of the version contained in the Shdhnameh, all describe one or more generations as existing prior to those upon whom attention is centered. In the present case the repli¬ cation follows rather than precedes the principal sequence of events. To be sure, there is a major structural problem here in that in all other versions surveyed, including the Enuma-Elish, there is a de¬ nouement. One figure, be he Zeus, Teshub, Baal, Feridun, Odin, or Marduk, puts a seal on the succession. In the “Theogony of Dunnu,” however, Lahar is in turn overthrown, and the series of usurpations is seemingly without end. Nor do we see here any indication of emas

culation, although Lambert and Walcot, in comparing the text with Hesiod, suggest, perhaps leaning a bit too heavily upon Freud, that mother lust is equivalent to castration.108 On this point I suggest that the very brevity and laconic nature of the text perhaps precluded the elaboration of such details as how the sovereignty was transferred
(e.g., via emasculation or the “tearing off” of a tiara). One interesting point of comparison between the Dunnu text and Hesiod’s Theogony relates to the order in which Sea and River ap¬ pear. According to Hesiod, the two figures associated with the sea, Pontos and Okeanos, emerge in succeeding generations. Pontos is essentially an autochthon, having emerged from Gaia without bene¬ fit of sexual intercourse, while Okeanos is born of Ouranos and Gaia. There is no doubt that Pontos is the sea proper, but Okeanos is more specifically defined as the ‘father of rivers,” the river that circles the earth (cf. Theogony 695-696). This order is paralleled in the “The¬ ogony of Dunnu”; Sea is an autochthon, whereas River belongs to the third generation.107 Lambert and Walcot also point out that there is a parallel to Hesiod in the marital relationships that obtain. The Titans regularly contract sibling marriages (cf. Kronos and Rhea), “but it is only Ouranos and Pontos who practice incest to the extent of mating with their own mother. . . ,”108 Again, in the “Theo¬ gony of Dunnu” both Sea and Earth are involved in such marriages, and matings between siblings abound.
These, then, are the Babylonian versions. So far no Sumerian coun¬ terpart has come to light, although several important Sumerian di¬ vinities are present in the texts just discussed, for example, Enki (Ea) and Anu. I do not mean to suggest that the Greek and other nonBabylonian versions of the “Kingship in Heaven” theme are neces¬ sarily based specifically upon the Enuma-Elish or the “Theogony of Dunnu.” Rather, in one way or another all the previously discussed
theogonies109 may be based upon the immediate sources of these two Babylonian texts, sources that themselves would appear to have been Babylonian and perhaps even Sumerian. This suggestion is strength¬
ened in that we now have two distinct versions of the theme, each dating from the early second millennium b.c., from two distinct centers of Babylonian culture, that is, Babylon proper and Dunnu.

The fact that one of these was a minor center adds even more
strength.
CONCLUSIONS
Most of the principal points of comparison among the several ver¬ sions which have been noted are summed up in the table on the facing page. The question that remains is whether or not the “Kingship in Heaven” theme is Indo-European. Wikander’s assumption that the theme is part of the Indo-European
mythological inheritance is based principally upon the concordances among the Greek, Hittite, and Iranian versions. These concordances are in fact present, and there is no doubt that the three versions are part of a single tradition. But the fact that these three Indo-European¬ speaking communities share a common theogonic theme does not in
itself mean that such a theme is part of their common mythological inheritance. By the same token, it can be said that a fair number of Indo-European speaking communities today share a common belief in how the world was created: by a God whose principal attributes are omnipotence and an intense jealously of all other pretenders to
divine status. There is, of course, no doubt whatsoever that this idea was borrowed from the Judaic tradition. We have a clear record of when and where the borrowing occurred. But suppose that we did not have such a record; suppose that a Martian scholar eons hence were to be confronted with this common tradition—present, albeit, among many non-Indo-European speakers as well. Would he not be tempted to view the relationships from a genetic standpoint? Would he not be tempted to reconstruct a common Indo-European cos¬ mogony involving “the hand of God moving across the waters,” and
so on? I suggest that those who argue for an Indo-European origin as far as the divine kingship is concerned have most likely fallen into the same trap as our hypothetical Martian. The problem here is that, unlike the spread of the Judaic cosmogony, the spread of the idea of divine kingship cannot be documented. There is no clear record of events to mark its spread from ancient Babylonia to Anatolia, Phoe¬ nicia, Iran, Greece, and ultimately, perhaps, to Scandinavia. There
is nothing here comparable with the conversion of Clovis or the ministry of St. Patrick. Yet spread it did, from one religious system to another, the initial impetus being perhaps the prestige of the Baby¬ lonian tradition. By the time the theme reached Scandinavia (if in¬ deed it did not evolve there independently), the Babylonian roots had long since become obscure, and the prestige would have been

that of the Greco-Roman tradition, to which it had diffused perhaps
two millennia earlier. Two of the chief reasons for ruling out an Indo-European origin are the absence, previously noted, of the theme in the Indie tradition and its very late appearance in that of ancient Iran. Also important in this connection is its absence in the ancient Celtic tradition. Ad¬ mittedly much of our knowledge of Celtic religion is confined to those elements of it that persisted in Ireland; yet even here, given the care taken by the medieval Irish monks to preserve their heritage, one would assume that if the theme had been present before the ar¬ rival of Christianity it would have carried over. But only by the most
Procrustean of methods can one make a case for its presence in the traditions relating to the Tuatha De Danann and their predecessors.
It is simply not present. Thus, that neither the Veda’s, the Avesta, nor the Lebor Gabala know the theme is highly significant. With the exception of the Norse, all known versions center upon Mesopotamia. Even Egypt does not seem to have known a clear version of the “Kingship in Heaven.”110 Its diffusion to Greece, usually thought to have been ac¬ complished via Phoenicia,111 may indeed have been much earlier than heretofore suspected. Lambert and Walcot suggest that the mythical conception of a divine kingship may have diffused directly from Mesopotamia to Greece during the Late Helladic period and
cite recent archaeological evidence (e.g., the presence of Babylonian cylinder seals at Thebes) indicative of widespread MycenaeanMesopotamian contacts.112 Its diffusion to the Hittites would prob¬
ably have been accomplished via the Hurrians, who had come into close contact with the mainstream of Mesopotamian civilization by the middle of the second millennium b.c. Its late diffusion eastward to Iran may reflect more immediately the Hesiodic and/or Phoe¬ nician versions rather than the Babylonian versions themselves (cf. the very specific parallels between Zohak and Typhon). But whatever
the course taken, its absence in at least three widely separated and important Indo-European traditions, coupled with the early dates
no But Lambert and Walcot, op. cit., p. 69, point out that there is an Egyptian tradition according to which Sky devoured her children, quarreled with her husband, Earth, and therefore they were separated; for the relevant text, see H. Frankfort, The Cenotaph of Seti I at Abydos (London, 1933), p. 83. 111 Giiterbock, “The Hittite Version of the Hurrian Kumarbi Myths,” pp.
133-134- \ 112 Lambert and Walcot, op. cit., p. 72. Walcot, as we have seen (see n. go), has since modified his views and is convinced that the theme most likely diffused to Greece only after sustained contact had been reestablished with the Near East in the eighth century, B.c. (op. cit., p. 47).
The “Kingship in Heaven” Theme 119
of the Babylonian versions, would seem to give powerful support to my contention that it is of Babylonian113 and perhaps even ultimately
of Sumerian origin. No discussion of Indo-European origins would be complete with¬
out reference to Professor Dumezil’s theory of a common tripartite social and supernatural system, a system that is clearly evident in most of the ancient Indo-European speaking domain.114 Dumezil himself has refrained from any attempt to apply the tripartite model to the idea of the “Kingship in Heaven,” despite the fact that at first glance, at least, the three-generational sequences would seem to offer a fertile field in this regard. Even Wikander, in many ways Dum&il’s most brilliant disciple, and, as we have seen, the chief proponent of
the Indo-European origin theory, has refrained from attempting such an application.115 The closest Dumezil has come to the problem is the suggestion116 that the proto-Indo-European mythology possibly in¬
cluded a tradition that Heaven was the last and only surviving off¬ spring of a great water deity (probably female), who drowned all but one of her children as soon as they were born. His suggestion is based upon a comparison between the Norse god Heimdallr and the Vedic divinity Dyauh. Both are connected with water. Heimdallr is said to
have had nine mothers, who were conceived as “sea waves”; Dyauh and his seven brothers (the Vasus) are linked with the river goddess Ganga (Ganges), who drowns seven of the eight siblings, leaving only
Dyauh to reach maturity (cf. Mahabharata 1.3843—3963).
Certainly the personifications of sea and heaven play parts in both
113 The historical relationships proposed here are generally congruent with those proposed by Steiner (op. cit., p. 104), who sees the Enuma-Elish as the im¬ mediate source of two unattested versions of the theme which he labels “X” and “Y.” The “Y” version, Steiner suggests, ultimately reached Greece and manifested itself in Hesiod’s Theogony. The Hurrian-Hittite version reflects both the “X” and the "Y” versions, although the former would seem to be the most im¬ mediate source. He also suggests that the “X” version perhaps gave rise to a third unattested version, “Z,” which, together with the Hesiodic version, is reflected in Philo’s “history.” If Steiner is correct, it might be suggested that his hypothetical "Z” version could have diffused to Iran as well as to Phoenicia (cf. the specific correspondences between Philo and Firdausi as noted in the table and elsewhere); the Hesiodic version would be the immediate source of that con¬ tained in Snorri’s Edda. 114 The most succinct statement of Dumezil’s theory can be found in his L’ideologie tripartie des Indo-europeens (Brussels, 1958). For a brief analysis of this theory see my article "The Comparative Indo-European Mythology of Georges Dumezil,” JFI 1:147-166 (1964); for a more extended discussion of Dumezil’s ideas see my The New Comparative Mythology: An Anthropological Assessment of the Theories of Georges Dumezil (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1966). 115 Cf. ibid., pp. 63, 85. 116 “Remarques comparatives sur le dieu scandinave Heimdallr,” EC 8:263-283

the Greek and the Babylonian versions of the divine kingship (cf. Pontos, Tiamat), but in neither case do we have any clear identifica¬ tion of the drowning of all but one of their offspring. Moreover, Heimdallr plays no part whatsoever in the Norse version, nor do any of the other traditions surrounding the rather otiose Dyauh come
anywhere near to approximating the sort of divine succession so crucial to the presence of the theme in question. In short, it would seem to me that, even though Dumezil may well be correct in his sug¬ gestions as to the Indo-European roots of the traditions surrounding the births of Dyauh and Heimdallr, it would not be germane to the problem at hand. The presence of such a common Indo-European tradition would in no way alter my convictions as to the origin of
the theme. One of the most interesting suggestions yet made from a Dumezilian standpoint is that previously mentioned by F. Vian117 relative to the Greek Typhon myth. As Vian sees it, Zeus’s battle with the monster derives from an isolated story paralleling what Dumezil118 and others have suggested is the typical Indo-European myth of a fight between a second-function or warrior figure and a tricephalic monster (cf. Indra versus the son of Tvastar, and the like). This story later fused with a widespread non-Indo-European dragon¬ slaying account (which had also diffused to the Hittites; cf. the Ullikummi and Illuyanka narratives)119 that had been introduced into Greece by the Phoenicians in the early eighth century b.c. Thus, according to Vian, by the time of Hesiod the story as it is generally known in Greek mythology had fairly well crystallized. It is interest¬ ing that in later versions of the Typhon episode (i.e., those of Apollodorus and Nonnos) the details undergo progressive elaboration and become more and more similar to those of the Hurrian-Hittite version. As noted, the Hittite description of Ullikummi before Mount Hazzi is almost identical with Nonnos’ description of Typhon.
If Vian is correct, then some intriguing possibilities present them¬ selves. Perhaps the Hittites, too, grafted the dragon-slaying myth onto an inherited Indo-European three-headed monster tale and, like their Greek cousins a thousand years later, eventually fused this with the Babylonian account of the divine kingship. Thus there would be three distinct strata in both the Greek and Hittite versions: (1) the Indo-European account of the slaying of the tricephalus,

121
The “Kingship in Heaven” Theme
(2) the dragon-slaying myth, and (3) the “Kingship in Heaven” theme proper. Of course, it is by no means clear that the monster-slaying episode is disassociated in its origins from the rest of the theme under discussion. It is just as easy to make a case for the presence of this figure in the person of Tiamat—although its presence in the “The
ogony of Dunnu” is less clear. In sum, while it presents some alternative possibilities of inter¬ pretation of certain specific episodes associated with the “Kingship
in Heaven,” I do not feel that Vian’s arguments relative to Typhon add anything substantive to the argument favoring an Indo-European origin for the theme as a whole, and I must reiterate my conclusion
that it is most probably rooted in the Babylonian tradition.



The Threefold Death: An Indo-European Trifunctional Sacrifice?
DONALD J. WARD, University of California, Los Angeles
In one of his investigations of Germanic heroic and mythological traditions,1 Georges Dumezil speculates that the Norse heroic tradi¬ tions treating the careers of Hadding and Hunding (and sometimes Frotho), represent euhemerizations of the careers of the Norse gods, Njordr and Freyr. According to Dumezil, the two phases in the career of Hadding represent the two phases in the career of Njordr, the first phase being the “Vanic” period, during which Njordr was firmly associated with the third function, and the second phase being the period during which the god became the protege of Odin and, in so doing, became a divinity of the first function. Dumezil finds evidence that supports his hypothesis in an episode in Book I of Saxo Gram¬ maticus. In this episode, the hero Hunding meets an accidental death when he falls into a vat of beer. Upon learning the news of Hunding’s fate, Hadding hangs himself. Dumezil sees in this episode the survival of a sacrificial myth in which the death by drowning in a vat involves a ritual of the third function, whereas death by hanging represents a
ritual of the first function. The hypothesis of Dumezil is thus based on the assumption that, in Germanic religion, there were once separate sacrifices performed for the divinities of the first and third functions. This assumption, how¬ ever, has not been tested. Therefore, I have investigated the available sources in order to establish whether there is a correlation between the classes of Germanic divinities and the sacrifices made to them.

and, if so, whether there are corresponding practices found among other Indo-European peoples. It has long been established that, in Germanic religion, the prac¬ tice of sacral hangings was associated with the cult of Odin, who, according to Dumezil, represents the Varunaic half of the IndoEuropean first function. The very epithets Hangi, HangagoS, Hangatyr, and Galgavaldr, all of which are borne by Odin, indicate such a relationship. There is, moreover, a myth in which Odin himself is envisioned as hanging in a tree for nine days (Havamal 138), saying that he was “given to Odin, I myself, to myself, in the tree of which no one knows from what roots it grows”. Snorri, furthermore, writes (Ynglingasaga 7) that Odin “sometimes roused the dead out of the earth or sat under the hanged, and therefore he was called the lord of ghosts or the king of the hanged.” There is, in addition, evidence from German folklore which indicates that Wotan, the South Ger¬ manic counterpart of Odin, was similarly associated with hanging. Various folk legends tell of the one-eyed personification of the wind who leads the raging army of the souls of the hanged across the heavens. One fourteenth-century source even refers to this host of lost souls as “Wutanes her.”2
An account of an actual sacrificial ritual, during which a human victim is offered to Odin by hanging, has been preserved in the Vikarssaga as well as in the Danish history of Saxo Grammaticus (6.5). In both sources there is an account of the hanging of King Vfkar, whom the hero Starkadr offers to Odin. That such sacral hang¬ ings belong to an early stratum of Germanic religion is confirmed by the earliest reports of sacrificial practices among Germanic peoples. Prokopios, for example (.De bello Gotico 2.15, 23), describes the vic¬ tory celebration of the Thulites and reports that prisoners of war were hanged in trees.3 Orosius writes of a similar ritual after the Cimbrian victory over the Romans (Historia adversus paganos 5.16). Similarly, Adam of Bremen wrote in the eleventh century (Gesta 4.27) that horses, dogs, and men were hanged in the sacred grove at Uppsala.
The second sacrificial ritual mentioned by Dumezil involves the drowning of a human victim in a vat or tub. Dum^zil’s contention

Hofler, Kultische Geheimbiinde der Germanen (Frankfurt^ 1934), pp. 1-83. 3 According to Pliny the Elder (Naturalis Historia, 18.3), a similar hanging ritual was practiced by the Romans. There is also evidence of such a sacrifice in ancient Greece. See M. P. Nilsson, Griechische Feste von religioser Bedeutung mit Ausschluss der Attischen (Leipzig, 1906), pp. 234-237.
125
The Threefold Death
that this kind of sacrifice represents an Indo-European third-function ritual is given support by the occurrence of this motif in various heroic and popular traditions of Indo-European speaking peoples. Elsewhere within Germanic tradition one reads that Fjolnir, son of Yngvifreyr (Heimskringla 1.24—25) drowns after falling into a vat
of beer. In Greece, the motif is found in the Story of the Thessalian Piasos4 and in that of Glaukos, son of Minos and Pasiphae, who drowns after accidentally falling into a vat of honey (Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3.3.1). Similarly, in Ireland there are several heroes who are reported to have drowned in a vat of beer during a festival.5 The motif can also be found in Scandinavian and German variants of the folk legend “The Death of Pan,” in which a dwarf is reported to have
fallen into a brewing vat.6 The occurrence of this motif in widely separated areas, each of which is occupied by an Indo-European speaking people, points to the possibility that it was based on an Indo-European mythological theme, which was associated from the earliest times with a sacrificial ritual, and which had been adopted into various heroic and popular traditions. Further evidence of such a ritualistic drowning among Indo-European peoples will be adduced in the course of this investi¬ gation. For the present, however, I wish to focus upon the evidence
of this practice in Germanic tradition. The most convincing single piece of evidence that links ritualistic drowning with Germanic divinities of the third function is found in chapter 40 of Tacitus’ Germania. Tacitus reports that the sacred wagon of Nerthus was sprinkled with water, after which slaves were
drowned as an offering to the goddess. It has long been established that Nerthus, a female counterpart of the Norse Njordr, is a divinity of fertility and abundance. Moreover, the practice of sprinkling water on the wagon of the goddess is ob¬ viously an example of ritualistic imitative magic of the kind found all over Europe in fertility and rain-producing rituals. Such practices have been observed in rural areas of Germany in this century.7 It is apparent that the ritual described by Tacitus was performed with the intent of promoting fertility, and the fact that the mode of human sacrifice to the fertility divinity took the form of drowning lends con

siderable support to Dumezil’s hypothesis that drowning involves a ritual of the third function.
Various observations recorded by other early historians reveal that sacrificial drowning was an important ritual in Germanic religion from early times. Orosius (Historia 5.16) writes that after the Cimbrian victory over the Romans, horses were drowned in a river. Adam of Bremen (schol. 134) describes a human sacrifice by drowning in a spring at the sacred grove of Uppsala. In the ninth-century Vita Vulframmi (chap. 8) it is reported that two youths were sacrificed to the sea by being abandoned on a sandbar, to be swept away by the rising tide. This identical method of sacrifice is evidently reflected in the episode in Snorri’s SkalcLskaparmAl, in which the dwarfs, Fialarr and Galarr, are taken by the giant, Suttungr, to a sandbar at sea, where they are likewise abandoned to the rising tides.8 This means of doing away with victims is also reported to have been used in penal execution. In the Heimskringla (c5lafssaga Tryggvasonar, 70) Eyvindr
kelda and his followers are bound and likewise abandoned on a sandbar as punishment for a crime. These cases are of particular im¬ portance for this investigation. The three reports deal respectively with an actual sacrifice, a literary-mythological motif, and a criminal execution. In all three cases the identical method is used for doing away with the victim. This combination of evidence indicates that ancient religious practices can survive long after their religious func¬ tion has been forgotten. The report in Snorri’s Edda indicates that the mythological theme, based on a sacrificial ritual, can survive as a literary motif. Similarly, the report in the Heimskringla indicates that the method of killing used in penal executions can evolve from
earlier sacrificial practices. Whether the penal execution represents an offering to the offended god or demon, as Karl von Amira and others have tried to prove,9 remains problematic; it is unlikely that this contention can ever be established with any degree of certainty. Nevertheless, I believe that one can show that, in certain recorded
criminal cases, the punishment was determined by the type of crime committed, and, furthermore, that this relationship reflects the tri¬ partite structure of Germanic society.
Once again, the most convincing evidence is to be found in Taci

Abhandlung (Munich, 192a), pp. 1-415.

The Threefold Death
tus’ Germania. In chapter 12, Tacitus discusses penal executions and he states specifically that the crime determines the punishment: distinctio poenarum delicto. He then informs us that proditores et transfugas (‘traitors and deserters’) were hanged from trees, whereas ignavos et imbelles (‘cowards and nonwarriors’) and corpore infames were drowned in mires and bogs. The term ignavos et imbelles is a traditional combination in classical Latin. Cicero, among others, made frequent use of this word pair. The expression means, in fact, more than just ‘cowards and nonwarriors,’ but evidently was used to refer to the effeminate, the unmanly, and the timid. Thus when Taci¬ tus adds to this expression the term corpore infames it is evident that he is referring to a particularly flagrant kind of homosexuality or other unnatural sexual vice considered to be depraved enough to
warrant capital punishment.10 Thus the pattern that has been established for human sacrifice evidently holds true for human execution as well. Crimes of treason, that is, crimes against the sovereign state (first function), are punished in the same manner in which victims are sacrificed to the sovereign divinity: by hanging. And sexual crimes (third function) are punished in the same manner in which sacrifices are made to the divinities of
fertility: by drowning.11 Execution by drowning has a long history in Europe, and it would be almost impossible for a single investigator to assemble all the evi¬ dence for this practice.12 There is, furthermore, the question of whether the results would warrant—at least for this study—such an undertaking. In spite of the evidence adduced above, which reveals a relationship between the sacral offering and penal execution, one can¬ not automatically assume that every instance of drowning as punish¬
ment—especially those of a later date—is sacral in origin. There are, however, a few cases of execution by drowning which deserve special attention. In a remarkable investigation, in which a
10 See N. Beckman, “Ignavi et imbelles et corpore infames,” ANF 52:78-81
(1936). 11 That sacrifices and executions were performed by drowning in bogs has been confirmed by the many archaeological finds of human corpses in the mires of Denmark and North Germany. See, for example, G. Bibby, The Testimony of the Spade (New York, 1956), pp. 402-406. A passage in the Kjalnesinga saga, more¬ over, tells that people who were to be sacrificed (bldtudu) were cast into a bog which was called Blotkelda. According to the Flateyjarbok, when the Norwegian queen Gunnhildr arrived at the court of King Haraldr, the latter sent his slaves and “guests” to greet her. They seized the queen amid great tumult and jeering and drowned her in a deep morass. 12 See Amira, Todesstrafen, pp. 140-143. See also F. Strom, On the Sacral Origin of the Germanic Death Penalties, Kungliga Vitterhets Historic och Antikvitets Akademiens Handlingar, Del 52 (Stockholm, 1942), pp. 171-188.

great amount of data was assembled, Heinz Goldschmidt was able to show that in the Low Countries of Europe—with isolated examples in London and Magdeburg—a common form of execution during the late Middle Ages was by drowning in a vat.13 The drowning generally took place at night and was performed in secret. Goldschmidt at¬ tempts to show that this practice had its origin in heathen sacrificial practices and was only later adopted as a form of execution. Although such a contention is difficult to prove, the similarity of this practice with the motif of accidental drowning in a vat, which was discussed above, is too striking to be dismissed as mere coincidence.
One case cited by Goldschmidt warrants special attention. On February 18, 1478, George Duke of Clarence was secretly executed in the Tower of London by order of his brother. King Edward IV. Al¬ though the manner in which the execution was conducted was kept a secret, it was generally assumed that the Duke was drowned in a butt of malmsey wine. One such report is found in Robert Fayan’s New Chronicles of England and France, published in 1516: “This yere, that is to meane ye XVIII daye of February the duke of Clarence . . . brother te the kynge, thanne beyng prysoner in ye Tower, was se¬ cretly put to deth and drowned in a barell of malmsye within the sayd Tower.”14
Since the murder was performed in secret, one will probably never know with certainty whether the drowning in the vat of wine was the actual means by which the victim was killed. But since Goldschmidt has been able to show that this practice represented a traditional means of execution in the Low Countries during the late Middle Ages, such a situation must be considered a possibility. Until such time as new evidence can be adduced, however, this question will have to remain open.
Yet, one point is clear. Since the populace of London associated the murder of the Duke with the motif of drowning in a vat of wine, it is evident that this motif was, at that time, a part of the popular tradi¬ tion. It has already been shown that this motif occurs in the heroic
traditions of Greece, Ireland, and Denmark. We are thus once again
13 "Das Ertranken im Fass: Eine alte Todesstrafe in den Niederlanden,” Zeitschrift fur vergleichende Rechtswissenschaft 41:423-470 (1925); 42:248-288 09*7)14 Ed. H. Ellis (London, 1811), p. 666. M. Murray (The Divine King in England [London, 1954], p. 117) argues that the slaying of Clarence was actually the ritualistic sacrifice' of the King’s representative as part of a rite in which, originally, the king himself was the divine victim. This is an attractive hypothesis which, if tenable, could contribute much to this investigation. Unfortunately, the entire structure of Murray’s theories rests on a foundation of conjecture.
The Threefold Death 129
confronted with a familiar pattern, namely, a literary motif and a penal execution, both of which show the identical method of killing the victim. But one important element is lacking to make the pattern complete. Although evidence has already been adduced which shows that sacrificial drowning was an important ritual in early Germanic
religion, there are no written records indicating that a vat or a tub was used in which to drown the victims. There is, however, archae¬ ological evidence that confirms the existence of such a sacrifice. On the kettle of Gundestrup there is depicted a scene in which a large man in a robe—evidently a priest—is pushing a human victim head¬ first into a large tub.15 It is evident that this scene depicts a sacrificial ritual during which a human victim was drowned in a tub.
This evidence fills the gap in the pattern. The identical method of killing occurs as (1) an actual sacrificial practice, (2) a literary motif, and (3) a penal execution. This evidence, viewed in its totality, con¬ firms the contention of Dumezil that the motif of Hunding’s death by drowning in a vat of beer, as recorded in Saxo’s history, represents the euhemerization of a mythological theme, which originally was associated with a third-function sacrifice. Furthermore, since this motif occurs in Greece, Denmark, England, and Ireland, it is prob¬
able that the sacrificial myth in question dates back to the period of Indo-European unity. This myth was borne by the various migrating peoples to their respective new homelands where, in each instance, it later became euhemerized and was adopted into the respective heroic
and/or popular narrative tradition. Before concluding the discussion of Germanic third-function sac¬
rifices, I should like to adduce some relatively late evidence that shows that such sacrifices survived in Europe with remarkable tenaci¬ ty. In several areas of Europe there are documents in which are re¬ corded incidents of humans having been buried alive for the purpose of warding off the black plague. One such document is a letter, dated August 7, 1604, from King Christian of Denmark to the sheriff of Lundenaes in which the king directs that a woman, who buried her child alive, be executed. The crime had taken place in the year 1603,
the same year the plague was raging in Denmark.16 Several folk legends recorded in Scandinavia preserve evidence of the same practice. Children were reported to have been buried alive
15 S. Muller, Nordische Altertumskunde (Strasbourg, 1897-1898), II, 164-165. 1® See H. Knudsen, "En hest levende begravet,” Samlinger til Jydsk Historie og Topografi, 4. Raekke (1922), IV, 299-303. As late as the eighteenth century, there is a report of live burial having been performed to ward off disease. According to a court record from Sunnerbo in SmSland, a woman was forcibly nailed in a coffin during the epidemic that raged there in 1712. See Strom, op. cit., p. 205.

in the hope of warding off the dreaded plague.17 Remnants of this practice have, moreover, survived to relatively modern times, for there is evidence from several European areas that, as late as the latter half of the nineteenth century, farm animals were buried alive to avert hoof-and-mouth disease among cattle.18
From Ireland, there are similar reports that human sacrifice was practiced as a means of warding off disease. One such report is found in the Rennes Dindsenchas:
During the Trena of Taillte, at sunrise I twice invoked Mac Erca The three plagues to remove From Erin, though it be a woman’s command. Their hostages were brought out; The drowning of the bonds of the violated treaties Immolating the son of Aedh Slane To Mac Ere—it was not a cause for shame.19
From these lines one learns that human victims, in this case a group of hostages, and a captive prince, were sacrificed by drowning for the purpose of warding off the plagues. At this point it should be mentioned that, according to the tripartite theory of Dum^zil, one
of the important functions of the divinities of the third estate is to insure general well-being and to combat disease. Thus the above passage is additional evidence supporting the contention that sacri¬ fice by drowning was associated with the divinities of the third function.
In the cases adduced from Germanic-speaking areas, as seen above, the method used to sacrifice the victims was not by drowning but by burial alive. It can, I believe, be assumed that, in relatively arid
regions, in which there were no swamps or bogs, the practice of live burial could easily have supplanted that of drowning in a mire. Or, stated in other terms, burial alive as a sacrificial practice can be viewed as being in complementary distribution with sacrifice by drowning.
17 Variants of the legend have been collected in Dalsland (M. Hofberg, Svenska folksiigner [Stockholm, 1882], p. 122), in Halland (J. Kal<5n, Halldndska folkminnen, lokalsdgner och overtro fran Fagered [Stockholm, 1927], p. 207), and in Blekinge (E. Wigstrom, Folkdiktning, visor, sagner, sagor, gator, ordsprak, ringdansar, lekar och barnvisor [Copenhagen and Goteborg, 1880-1881], I, 285). For further examples, see Strom, op. cit., p. 206.

The Threefold Death J31
Additional evidence supporting the contention that burial alive can be associated with Dumezil's third function can be found in medieval legal documents. During the Middle Ages, one means of performing capital punishment in cities in Germany was by live burial. The records show that there was a relationship between this type of punishment and the nature of the crime committed. Accord¬ ing to Jacob Grimm,20 this type of execution was preferred for cases of theft, bestiality, sex crimes, and for the murder of illegitimate children. These crimes constitute specific violations of property, wealth, and sex, all of which belong to the domain of the third func¬
tion. This evidence reveals a rather astonishing continuity in the correlation between the type of crime committed and the manner of punishment from the time of Tacitus to relatively modern times.
Since the evidence adduced thus far seems to confirm a correlation between the sacrifice and the ideological structure in the case of the first and third functions among Germanic peoples, one might expect
a similar correlation in the case of the second function. There is, however, only a small corpus of evidence regarding special sacrifices to a Germanic god of war. Jordanes (Getica 5.41) stresses that the Goths worshiped Mars, who may represent Thor, the Germanic war god, with the spilling of much human blood (humani sanguinis effusione placandum). The report has a parallel in a much later docu¬
ment, namely in the Norman History of Dudo of St. Quintin,21 who
informs us that the Vikings, prior to embarking on a warring raid, sacrificed human life and smeared their bodies with the blood of their victims. Presumably if warriors performed such a blood sacri¬ fice as described by Jordanes and Dudo, the sacrificial instrument would be a weapon of war.22
A pattern thus begins to emerge from the evidence thus far as¬ sembled. Among Germanic peoples, there were essentially three methods of offering a human victim to the divinities: noose, water,
and weapon. These three means of execution, moreover, correspond to the three social classes, and to the three classes of divinities. Ad¬ mittedly, the evidence for the second function sacrifice is meager.
20 Deutsche Rechtsaltertiimer, 4. vermehrte Ausgabe, eds. A. Heusler and R. Hiibner (Leipzig, 1899), II, 275-277. 21 De Moribus 1.2. There is confirmation o£ a blood sacrifice to Thor in the Icelandic Eyrbyggja saga 10, in which a sacrificial temple is described in which there was a large fiat rock called “Thor’s stone”. The saga tells how the victim’s back was broken across the stone which had become red with the blood of many victims. 22 See Amira, op. cit., pp. 166-208, for evidence of execution and sacrifice with a weapon among various Indo-European peoples.



138 Donald J. Ward
The relative lack of evidence of this type of sacrifice among Germanic peoples can, I believe, be attributed to the fact that much of the sacrificial activity associated with warfare was frequently devoted to the cult of Odin, the “God of the Dead,”23 and not to Thor, the war
deity. There are, however, other reasons for the relative lack of evidence of this kind of sacrifice. In contrast with the Mediterranean peoples, warfare for the Germans involved not warriors alone, but the entire community. Tacitus, for example (Germania 8), stresses the fact that women were present during battle, baring their breasts as a gesture to remind the men of that to which their wives would be exposed if the battle were lost. Tacitus also mentions (Germania 7) that women were on hand during battle to tend the wounds of their men. It is
evident that, in Germanic society, all three social classes would have a profound interest in the outcome of battle and even share in the victory celebration. A passage in Saxo confirms this contention. In writing about the division of spoils after victory, Saxo (5.152) states that each of the social classes acquired its share of the booty. The chiefs were given the gold and silver, the warriors were given weap¬ ons, and the common people were given the ships. It can thus be seen that the society was divided into three classes, and this division corresponds precisely to the tripartite structure as posited by Dumezil. One can imagine that it became a tradition among Germanic peo¬ ples to celebrate a victory with an elaborate festival during which not only a division was made of the booty, but offerings were made to the appropriate divinities of each of the three social classes. Evidence of such a celebration has been recorded by Orosius who writes that after the Cimbrian victory over the Romans (Historia adversus paganos 5.16), the victorious barbarians hanged prisoners in trees, cast silver and gold into the water, and drowned horses in the river. These three kinds of offerings correspond strikingly to the three social classes and to their respective kinds of sacrifices. The hangings clearly represent an offering to Odin, the drowning of the horses is apparently a third-function sacrifice, and the offerings of gold and silver conceivably could represent a second-function ritual.24
23 See E. Mogk, Die Menschenopfer bei den Germanen, Abhandlungen der Koniglichen Sachsischen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften, Phil.-Hist. Klasse XXVII, 17:603-643 f(Leipzig, 1909). Mogk, who wrote long before Dumezil, and thus was not trying to defend a tripartite hypothesis, likewise concluded that the victory offerings made to Odin did not take the form of sacrifices made to a divinity of war, but were apparently made in honor of the "God of the Dead.” 24 A similar tripartite celebration may be alluded to by Tacitus (Annales 1.61)
The Threefold Death 433
Additional evidence of a tripartite sacrifice after battle can be observed in an illustration from the seventeenth century by J. van Ossenbeeck entitled “Kriegsgreuel.” In this illustration a victory celebration is depicted during which prisoners of war are sacrificed. One prisoner is shown hanging in a tree. Another is being decapitated
by sword. And off to one side a large vat is shown, in which another prisoner has apparently been drowned.25 This painting seems to confirm the pattern of noose, weapon, and water as means of carrying
out human sacrifice. One might, of course, raise the valid objection that a painting of the seventeenth century is scarcely the place where one would expect to find evidence of ancient Germanic sacrificial practices. Neverthe¬ less, the trifunctional victory celebration, with the traditional sacri¬ fices, is depicted in surprising detail. I suggest three possible explana¬ tions: (1) The artist had access to sources that described earlier victory celebrations; (2) the victory celebrations, with the three kinds of sacrifices, survived in form long after their original religious signifi¬ cance had been forgotten and, as such, were still practiced in the
Thirty Years’ War; (3) the artist created a scene of horror from his imagination alone, and made no attempt to depict a traditional
celebration. It is probably impossible to determine which, if any, of the three explanations represents the correct one, at least until such time as new evidence can be adduced. For the present, I am inclined to look upon the second explanation as the one that best explains the scene
depicted by the artist. In short, the evidence thus far points toward the following tenta¬ tive conclusions: Germanic peoples not only performed separate sacrifices to their respective classes of divinities, but also performed a trifunctional rite after victory in battle. During these celebrations offerings were made simultaneously to the three classes of deities. Admittedly, this conclusion has been reached on the basis of a rela
when he writes that the site at which Germanic tribes celebrated their victory over the Romans in the battle of the Teutoburg forest was marked by skulls hanging on trees, broken weapons, and the bones of horses scattered about. Of course, the weapons and the bones of the horses could be merely battle remnants. The drowning of horses as a sacrifice is documented in ancient Greece. For example, Homer writes (Iliad 21.130-132) that horses were drowned in honor of the river god, Skamandros. Moreover, there is evidence that horses and bulls were drowned in honor of Poseidon. See L. Farnell, “Sacrifice (Greece),” in Encyclo¬ paedia of Religion and Ethics, ed. J. Hastings (New York, 1958), XI, 12-18. 25 G. Hirth, Kulturgeschichtliches Bilderbuch aus drei Jahrhunderten (Leipzig and Munich, 1883), V, 1616, pi. 2396. Ossenbeeck was born in Rotterdam in 1627 and died in Regensburg in 1678.

tively small corpus of material, and additional data would be needed before one could accept the findings as fact. Such supporting evi¬ dence can be found in other Indo-European religious traditions. Of all Indo-European religions, the Celtic can provide the best com¬
parative data. Among the most important sources for Celtic religion is the first-century Latin poem Pharsalia by Lucan and the commen¬ taries written by the scholiasts between the fourth and ninth cen¬ turies. Just as Adam of Bremen mentions three distinct divinities for
Germanic peoples, so does Lucan mention a triad of deities for the Celts, namely, Esus, Taranis, and Teutates. Similar to Germanic reli¬ gion, there were separate kinds of human sacrifice performed in
honor of each of the gods. Just as in Germanic religion hanging was associated with the cult of Odin, the Commenta to Lucan mention that the victims offered to Esus were hanged and left suspended until their limbs wasted
away.26 It would be convenient to conclude that the figure of Esus repre¬ sents a first function, that is, an Odinic-Varunaic, divinity. But this conclusion involves some difficulty. First, the Commenta to Lucan provide precious little information regarding the functions of the divinities. Second, in Celtic religion Lug is apparently the true coun¬
terpart of Odin-Varuna, and thus hanging ought to be linked with Lug rather than with Esus. Yet Esus is generally hard to pin downthe Commenta equate him both with Mercury and with Mars—and since Lug is not mentioned by Lucan, it can be assumed that Esus
has moved into the Odinic-Varunaic slot.27 The Commenta to Lucan report that the human victims offered to Taranis were sacrificed in quite a different manner. The victims were placed in a large basket-like structure which was then ignited, cremating those inside.28 This kind of sacrifice has also been recorded by Strabo, who writes that a large structure was made of wood and straw into which all kinds of animals and humans were cast. The structure was then ignited, creating a bloody holocaust.29
26 M. Annaei Lucani Commenta Bernensia, ed. H. Usener (Leipzig, 1869), I, 445: ‘‘Hesus Mars sic placatur: homo in arbore suspenditur usque donee per cruorem membra digesserit.” Elsewhere in this same paragraph Esus is equated, not with Mars, but with Mercury. Hereafter cited as Commenta. 27 For further discussion of this problem, see de Vries, Keltische Religion, pp. 97-100, who likewise concludes that Esus represents an Odinic divinity. 28 Commenta, If 445: “Taranis Ditis pater hoc modo aput eos placatur: in alueo ligneo aliquod homines cremantur.” 29 De Vries (op. cit., p. 222) adduces numerous parallel episodes from Celtic heroic tradition in which a hero is killed by cremation. De Vries argues con¬ vincingly that such episodes represent survivals of sacrificial myths.
The Threefold Death 135
The third divinity mentioned by Lucan, Teutates, was honored by still another means of human sacrifice. According to the Commenta, a man was thrust headfirst into a vat, and was held in that position until he drowned.30 In this passage, Teutates is equated with Mer¬
cury, a fact that might lead one to believe that we are again con¬ fronted with a first-function divinity. Since Esus, however, who is also equated with Mercury, most likely represents the Celtic firstfunction sovereign divinity, and since Teutates is associated with the rite of drowning victims in a vat, which has been shown to be a third-function sacrifice, it is highly probable that Teutates repre¬ sents the Celtic third function. This contention is supported by the etymology of the name: *teuta, ‘people,’ indicating that he was a divinity of all the people, and, as such, his role would be parallel to the roles of other third-function deities of Indo-European tradition.
The material that has been adduced for Celtic religion reveals a striking agreement with the situation found in Germanic religion. In each case, there is a triad of divinities representing the three social
classes, and each of the gods is honored by a separate kind of human sacrifice. Moreover, the pattern for Celtic tradition is remarkably similar to that found in Germanic tradition. In the latter, the three
means of doing away with the victim were by noose, weapon, and water, whereas in Celtic religion, the three methods are noose, fire, and water. And as in the Germanic sources, the noose was associated with the first-function sacrifice, and water with the third-function sacrifice. Only in the case of the second function does one find an apparent inconsistency. In Germanic religion the weapon was used, whereas in Celtic religion fire was preferred. The two methods of sacrificing a victim are apparently in complementary distribution.
That is, killing by weapon and by fire represent variants of a single
class of sacrificial practice. There are, moreover, further parallels with Germanic religious
practices. For example, it has been shown that Germanic peoples celebrated their victories with simultaneous sacrifices to the three classes of divinities. Similarly, in Celtic tradition, there is evidence of such “trifunctional” rituals. This evidence is found chiefly in the ancient heroic literature of Ireland and specifically in the complex of
motifs known as the “Threefold Death.” The earliest record of the theme is found in Adhamnan’s seventhcentury account of the life of St. Columba.31 The Irish saint propheti

cally informs Aedh the Black that he will die three different deaths. He will be wounded in the neck with a spear, fall from a tree into the
water, and he will drown. One can speculate that the fall from the tree represents a variant of hanging. Indeed, evidence adduced below shows that such is precisely the case. The conclusion to this episode seems to be somewhat garbled: Aedh is wounded, falls from a boat,
and drowns. This episode corresponds in striking detail to two Latin poems written by Bishop Hildebert of Le Mans in the early twelfth cen¬ tury.32 In each of the poems a boy asks the gods how he will die. Venus replies that he will die in a noose, Mars says by a weapon, and Nep¬ tune says by water. The youth climbs a tree above a river, falls in such a way that his sword pierces his breast, and his head is submerged. Once again, the three methods of death correspond to the tripartite sacrificial practices: noose, weapon, and water. The fact that the noose is the predicted form of death, and the actual death occurs by a fall from a tree, confirms the above assumption that the prediction of death by a fall from a tree actually represents death by hanging.
A variant of this tale occurs in the poems ascribed to Saint Moling as they appear in the Anecdota of Michael O’Clery, and which are associated with the Irish legend of Suibhne Geilt.33 Although the Anecdota date from the seventeenth century, the material is obvious¬
ly very much older. There are brief references to the poems as early as the ninth and tenth centuries.34 Grag, who has killed Suibhne, is told by St. Moling that he will die by a weapon, by being burned, and by drowning. Grag is relieved to hear this prophecy, for he knows that, since man can die but once, the prophecy must be wrong. Never¬ theless, fate is inevitable, for when Grag is climbing an oak tree, he is wounded by his spear, falls from the tree into a fire, and then into the water in which he drowns. Once again, we find the identical pat¬ tern: noose (represented by a fall from the oak tree), weapon, and water. There is, however, a new element, namely, fire. It has already been shown that, in Celtic religion, fire apparently replaced the weap¬ on as a means of killing in the second-function sacrifice. Curiously, in this source, both a weapon and fire are mentioned. The same episode occurs in the Irish life of St. Moling,35 with an important addition. In this account, the punishment of the villain is

Jackson, "The Motive of the Three¬ fold Death in the Story of Suibhne Geilt,” in Essays and Studies presented to Eoin MacNeil (Dublin, 1940), pp. 535-550. 33 MS Brussels 5100-5104, quoted from Jackson, op. cit., p. 539. 34 J.

Stokes, “The Birth and Life of St. Moling," RC 27:285-287 (1906).
The Threefold Death *37
evidently associated with the crime that was committed. For Grag is not only guilty of killing Suibhne, but also of having stolen cattle. The theft of cattle apparently represents a violation of the third estate, whereas the killing of Suibhne could represent a secondfunction violation. A third crime is not mentioned, and one can only speculate that the threefold death was once associated with a crime
against each of the three functions. A variant of the episode is also to be found in the account of the exploits of King Diarmaid, who lived in the sixth century. The ac¬ count is recorded in the eleventh-century Silva Gadelica.33 It is pre¬ dicted that King Diarmaid will meet death by three different means, by a weapon, by burning, and by drowning. During a festival, the
king is wounded with a spear, the house is burned over him, he creeps into a vat of beer to avoid the flames, and drowns. The fact that the death of the king is reported to have taken place during the celebra¬ tion of a festival is of special importance. I suggest that this account represents the euhemerization of a sacrificial myth which was associ¬ ated with a periodic festival during which a human victim, most likely a king, was sacrificed simultaneously to the three classes of
divinities. The same story is told of Aidhedh Muirchertaig mac Erca in a fourteenth-century manuscript37 in incomplete fashion, for only two
of the deaths are reported. During a festival, Mac Erca’s house is burned, and, to avoid the flames, the hero climbs into a vat of beer and half burns and half drowns. That this version is incomplete is confirmed by allusions to the hero’s death in other manuscripts, one dating from the twelfth century, the other from the thirteenth.38 In both cases, it is mentioned that Mac Erca died by three different means, by a weapon, by burning, and by drowning. Once again, one is confronted with what appears to be the survival of a sacrificial myth, in which it is told how a victim is sacrificed simultaneously to
the three classes of divinities. This theme of the threefold death later became a part of popular oral tradition and was told as a kind of a “fate tale” in which the hero’s fate was determined from birth. As the story becomes further removed from its religious background, the manner in which the hero suffers death undergoes changes. This development is not sur¬ prising. When the ritualistic significance is forgotten, the only im

portant aspect is that the hero dies three deaths, and the manner in which he dies becomes of ever-decreasing importance. The theme occurs in legends recorded in the British Isles, and is associated with the careers of Myrddin, Merlin, and Lailoken.39 In
the Vita Merlini by Geoffrey of Monmouth,40 Merlin predicts that a youth will die in a tree, by a fall from a rock, and drown. The youth later suffers all three deaths simultaneously. In the account treating the figure of Lailoken, the three deaths are by stoning, beating, pier¬ cing with a stake, and by drowning.41 In a Welsh fate tale, it is pre¬ dicted that a youth will die by snakebite, by a fall from a tree, and by drowning.42 The boy later climbs a tree, is bitten by a snake, falls and breaks his neck—a variant of the hanging motif—and drowns in a
river below. The modern folktale treatment of the threefold death has a wide distribution, having been recorded in variants from Ireland to Iran. A relatively complete comparison of these tales can be found in a recent monograph by R. Brednich,43 and therefore they need not be treated here in detail. Instead, in referring to these tales, I limit my remarks to the place where the tale was collected, and to the manner
in which the hero suffers the threefold death.

The Threefold Death !39
The motif of the snakebite, which is especially well represented in East Europe and Asia, evidently represents a secondary intrusion. It occurs only in the tales that have been collected at a relatively recent date, and is totally lacking in the older written sources. Hangingand its variant, fall from a tree—burning, wounding with a weapon, and drowning are all motifs that occur in the earliest sources and evidently have belonged to the tradition from the earliest times. A study of the distribution of the modern folktale, and consider¬ ation of the oldest written sources, apparently leaves only one tenable conclusion regarding the origin and dissemination of the tale. The tale had its origin in ancient Ireland and then spread by diffusion to the various European and Asian locations. But there is an alternative explanation. One can assume that the theme was a part of the mythol¬ ogy of the Indo-Europeans and was borne by the migrating IndoEuropean peoples to their respective new homelands, and then, in each new area, the tale became a part of the local narrative tradition. Or, stated in other terms, one can explain the distribution of the tale either by the “diffusion” theory or by the “Indo-European” theory. Although I favor the diffusion theory in explaining most of the vari¬ ants and their distribution, I believe that, in at least one instance, the Indo-European theory represents a more plausible explanation. Such an instance is represented by a variant of the tale as it was recorded in a Low German dialect by Gottfried Henssen in the town of Unter
siebeneick in the year 1927.51 In this tale a prophet tells a mother in labor that her child should not be born during that hour, for “wenn dat Kenk en de Stond te Welt kom, dan kom et to en doadonglocklichen Doad: entweder et hong seek op oder et verdronk.”52 The child, alas, is born during the
fateful hour. As it becomes old enough to walk, every effort is made to avert the prophesied death. The child is never allowed to play alone. Later the child, under close supervision, is playing near the water when it becomes entangled in a willow twig (Wiedenstruck), falls into the water, and is simultaneously strangled and drowned.
Of particular importance in this tale is the occurrence of the motif of strangulation by a willow twig, a motif that does not occur in any of the other variants of the tale. There is a curious parallel to this motif in a narrative recorded many centuries earlier in the same gen¬
eral North Germanic area. It is to be found in the accounts of the death of the Danish king Vikar. The story exists in two prose versions.

One account is in the Danish history of Saxo Grammaticus (5-5)> the other in the Vikarssaga, which had been intercalated in the Icelandic Gautrekssaga. Fragments of the episode also occur in verse form in
the Vikarsbalkr. In the version preserved in the Gautrekssaga, we learn that King Vikar sails to HorSaland with his army, but is held up by a headwind at some holms. Sacrificial chips (blotspan) are dropped to ascertain the will of the gods, and it is determined that Odin desires a man for hanging. The victim is to be selected by drawing lots. The lot falls to King Vikar himself, and it is decided to hold a conference the next day. During the night Odin appears and commissions Starkadr to send King Vikar to him, giving him for the purpose a spear that looks like a reed. The following morning the king’s counselors decide, on Starkadr’s advice, to arrange a sham sacrifice. J ust near the scene is a small pine tree, at the foot of which is a stump. A narrow twig stretches above the stump. Starkadr has the entrails taken from a new¬ ly slaughtered calf. He steps onto the stump and makes a noose out of the soft entrails and ties it to the narrow, supple twig. Starkadr there¬ upon says to the king: “Now is a gallows ready for thee, O king! and it looks not very dangerous. Come hither, then, that I may lay the noose about thy neck.” The king replies: “If this arrangement is not more dangerous for me than it appears, I do not expect it to harm me; but if it is otherwise, may destiny take its course.” He then stepped onto the stump, Starkadr laid the noose about his neck and stepped down from the stump. Starkadr now touched the king with the reed and said: “I now give thee to Odin.” Thereupon Starkadr released the pine twig. At this point, three curious events occur: The reed turned into a spear and pierced the king, the stump fell from under his feet, and the soft entrails of the calf became a strong willow twig (vidju), and the branch flew up and lifted the king into the
branches where he was strangled. In the account that appears in Saxo’s history, there are only a few, but nevertheless important, differences. According to Saxo, Odin wishes the death of Vikar, and to achieve this end he grants to the hero, Starcatherus, superhuman strength and the life-span of three human lives. The hero makes the noose, not out of a calf’s entrails, but out of willow twigs {ex viminibus). In both cases, however, the actual strangulation occurs by means of willow twigs, the same man¬ ner by which jjhe child in the Low German folktale was strangled.
A close examination of the death of Vikar reveals that the king loses his life by the simultaneous occurrence of three events. The reed becomes a spear and wounds the victim, the stump falls over, the
The Threefold Death 141
pine twig flies up, and the king is strangled by the entrails that have become a strong willow branch. It is thus probable that one is here confronted with a variant of the theme of the threefold death. This contention is supported by the account in Saxo’s history. Saxo states
specifically that Odin is using Starkadr as a tool to acquire the life of Vfkar, and he grants to the hero the life-span of three human lives. The payment of the threefold death is thus a threefold life, and with this payment a kind of divine balance of life and death is maintained. It is, moreover, probable that in this Germanic version of the three¬ fold death, the means of execution was originally by noose, water, and weapon. One can imagine that it became increasingly difficult to make plausible an accident in which the victim is hanged and drowned simultaneously. In Celtic tradition this problem had been solved in an obvious manner; the hanging motif had been weakened to merely that of falling from a tree. Here in Germanic tradition a similar solution was reached; the motif of drowning had been weak¬ ened by merely indicating that the victim fell from a stump. This contention is supported by the occurrence of the drowning motif in the Low German variant of the tale of the threefold death which was already discussed. In the German tale the child suffers a simultaneous twofold death by drowning and by strangulation when it becomes entangled in a willow twig {Wiedenstruck) and falls in the water. The occurrence of the willow twig strongly suggests that this tale is related—not directly to the Celtic tradition, as are many of the variants of the tale—but to the Germanic accounts of the sacrifice of Vikar. In view of this evidence, it can now be assumed that the drown¬ ing motif was part of the Germanic treatment of the threefold death, and it is thus probable that this motif was originally associated with
the accounts of the sacrifice of King Vikar. An important element shared by the Irish heroic legends, the popu¬
lar folktale, and the Germanic treatment of this theme is the estab¬ lishment in advance of the mode of death, either by dream, by
prophets, or—in the case of the Vikarssaga—by the drawing of lots and the appearance of Odin in person. In each of the traditions an at¬ tempt is made to avert the threefold death. But fate cannot be cheated, nor can the gods be deprived of their victim. Death is the
one incontrovertible fact of life. There is no escape, thus the three prophesied manners of death inevitably work simultaneously to de¬
prive the victim of his life. The evidence adduced thus far indicates that both Germanic and Celtic religion knew the three separate kinds of human sacrifice, corresponding to the three classes of divinities and to the three classes



148 Donald J. Ward
of society. Moreover, each tradition knew the legend of the threefold death in which all three modes of human sacrifice functioned simul¬ taneously. One question, however, remains unanswered: What is the nature of the relationship of the theme as it occurs in the Celtic and Germanic traditions? One could assume that the Germanic version of the legend represents an intrusion from Celtic tradition. There is certainly enough evidence of prolonged and intensive contact be¬ tween the two peoples to justify such an assumption. On the other hand, the relationship of the Germanic treatment of the legend with the Celtic treatment seems to be a distant one indeed. The Germanic legend, with the use of the willow twig, the reed, and with the dedica¬ tion of the victim to Odin, seems to represent a distinct tradition, deeply imbedded in Germanic religion. Moreover, the motif of death by fire, an important element in many of the Celtic variants, is totally missing from the Germanic treatments of the theme. In view of this evidence, one must look for another explanation of the relationship of the two traditions. If the relationship cannot be explained by diffusion, then the only tenable explanation that remains is the assumption of a common ancestor to both traditions. Since it has been established that the narrative tradition is based on sacrificial practices, and since it has been shown that these-practices reflect the Indo-European tripartite ideology as posited by Georges Dumezil, I suggest that this common ancestor lies in the religion of the Indo-Europeans.
The Threefold Death in Finnish Lore
JEANNINE E. TALLEY, University of California, Los Angeles
Outside the Indo-European sphere there is an interesting and peculiar appearance of the trifunctional sacrifice in the Finnish ballad “Mataleena.”1 In the following passage Christ exposes the sins of Magdalen
with these words:
Kussas kolme poikalastas?Yhden tuiskasit tulehen, toisen vetkaisit vetehen, kolmannen kaivoit karkeesehen. Sen kuin tuiskasit tulehen, siit’ ois Ruotsissa ritari; sen kuin vetkaisit vetehen, siit’ ois herra talla maalla;
sen kuin kaivoit karkeesehen, siit’ ois pappi paras tullut.
Where are your three sons?The first you burned in fire, The second you drowned in water. The third you buried in the earth. The one you burned in fire Could have been a knight in Sweden; The one you drowned in water Could have been a burgher in this country; The one you buried in the earth Could have been a good priest.
In this passage the three social classes of priest, knight, and burgher are represented, and correspondingly three distinct means of killing: burial, burning, and drowning respectively. Burial, in this instance,
seems to have supplanted hanging. How did this motif find its way into the popular tradition of a non-Indo-European people? As D. J. Ward indicated above, the folk¬ tale version of the “threefold death’’ spread by diffusion and is attested in Estonia, yet not in this type of ballad. The southern Euro¬ pean variants of the ballad do not have this motif, but rather closely

follow the narrative as it is preserved in a thirteenth-century Latin manuscript of Jacobus a Voragine. Julius Krohn2 believed that the ballad spread from southern Europe northward into Germany and Scandinavia. “Magdalen,” as Krohn also points out, has not survived in Germany; yet, there is a fragmentary text from Lausitz which he quotes.3 Below is a free translation of the text:
A beautiful maiden, Aria, goes on Sunday to fetch water. An old man comes who requests a drink from her. “The water is not clean; there is dust and dirt in it.” “The water is certainly clean, but you are impure.” “Prove it.” “Go to church with a wreath on your head.” Before her de¬ parture it withers. In the churchyard nine headless boys surround her. “Mother, why do you still go with the wreath on your head?” “Please forgive my crimel” “We surely could, but not God.” She goes to church to receive holy water, gets down on her knees before the altar and makes the sign of the cross, but at that instant sinks into the earth.
The death of the children and their illegitimacy are merely alluded
to respectively by the mention of the nine headless children and the withering of the wreath, which indicates that Aria is no longer a vir¬ gin. The significance of this text is that it combines two different ballads, “Magdalen” and “The Cruel Mother,” and suggests that the
inclusion of the motif from “The Cruel Mother” first occurred in Germanic tradition before spreading to the Scandinavian countries
and the British Isles. In Germany there are many variations of “The Cruel Mother” and many titles for the narrative which differ in finer details but which conform in the overall narrative pattern. Among the more popular names by which the ballad is known are: “Hollisches Recht,”4 “Die Rabenmutter,”5 and “Die Kindsmorderinn.”6 A passage quoted from Des Knaben Wunderhorn suffices to illustrate
the handling of the motif in the German ballad.
Tragst du ein Kranzlein rosenroth, Du hast ja schon drei Kinder todt. Das erste hast in Wasser getragen. Das ander hast in Mist vergraben. Das dritt in hohlen Baum gesteckt Und mit Eichenen Ruthlein zugedeckt.

The Threefold Death in Finnish Lore
Almost unanimously Finnish folklore scholars have concluded that the Finns borrowed “Magdalen” from Sweden; in the Swedish vari¬ ants, however, the children are thrown into a lake, a river, or the sea, thus representing only the sacrificial ritual of the third estate. In
addition to this aspect, the Swedish ballads do not mention the mem¬ ber places of the sons in the social structure. Because these two items
are lacking in Swedish ballads, it is possible that the Finns borrowed directly from the Germans. Conceivably this borrowing could have occurred sometime between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries, since the Hanseatic League brought Germans into direct contact with the Finns. In Gotland, at Visby, the League founded a center of com¬ merce. Many vessels sailed from Visby to Turku in quest of fish and furs, the merchants often spending their winters in Finland waiting
for the spring market.7 Lines similar to those in the Finnish “Magdalen” also occur in the Finnish lyrical song, “Leino Leski” (“The Pitiable Widow”). In this song a widow has been told to leave her castle because of an ensuing battle. The widow, however, defies the advice proudly announcing that she is not to be pitied and that she is not without means since
she has three sons to protect her:
One is a bishop in Turku, The second a knight in Sweden, The third a burgher in this country.
It happened that death heard this. Standing below the wall Already the bishop from Turku was killed. The knight from Sweden was killed. And the burgher from this country.8
Both the ballad and the song are isolated examples of the triadic
social class structure in Finnish tradition. The ballad has been pre¬ served in western Finland only in Ritvala in the province of Hame where it was traditionally sung in the Helka (Whitsuntide) festival until the nineteenth century. “Leino Leski” was sung mainly in Ingria and the Karelian Isthmus but has never been collected in
western Finland. There is, for the time being, no reason for asserting that the IndoEuropean social structure was wholly or even partially paralleled by the early Finns. Further investigations may uncover more examples

in support of such an assumption. For the present, however, one may only suggest that, after the ballad was transmitted to Finland, the Finns conserved the motif combining the Indo-European triadic social structure with the tradition of the trifunctional human sacri¬ fice. Social patterns introduced by Swedish rule may well have af¬ forded secondary reinforcement of its practical relevance.
Indo-European Elements
in Baltic and Slavic Chronicles
ROBERT L. FISHER, JR., University of California, Los Angeles
The search for Indo-European elements in ancient Slavic and Baltic paganism presents the investigator with a formidable challenge. On the one hand, the data are meager and of comparatively recent date, while on the other hand, what data we do possess are contained for the most part in Christian documents, and are thus distorted by the hostile attitudes of the authors toward the very paganism that they were trying to suppress. Furthermore, since no myths have survived qua myth, we are destined to be limited to euhemerization of older Indo-European beliefs. Aside from individual items of an Indo
European character which poke through the surface of the sea of Christianization like partly submerged mountain peaks, there are few legends that, as systems, present a consistent tripartite Weltan¬
schauung. Thus, the investigator
quaesitisque diu terris, ubi sistere possit, in mare lassatis volucris vaga decidit alis.1
Recently Georges Dumdzil recorded his own findings and incor¬ porated those of A. Yoshida and others who have been working with euhemerized myth in the Slavic area. They have usually dealt with the byliny, some of which are quite late (“la plus ancienne peut-etre du XIVe sRcle”).2 These workers have primarily bypassed the older

148 Robert L. Fisher, Jr.
sources (eleventh and twelfth centuries), such as The Russian Primary Chronicle. Recently V. N. Toporov investigated the gods as they are enumerated in this chronicle, in the Igor' Tale, and various other works. He has concerned himself directly with the ancient Slavic pantheon, and not with euhemerization. Toporov has postulated the
following order:3
First function: Stribogu = Varuna-Mitra Second function: Perunu = Indra Third function: Volosu = Nasatya
Although Perunu and Volosu are well placed in their respective functions, Stribogu is relegated to the first function primarily on the strength of a doubtful etymology: Stri-bogu < *pdtri-bhagos. Then
Stribogu would be parallel to pita dyauh, ZeO irarep, Jupiter, IE *pater dieus. The main objection here is that regardless of whether or not the etymology is correct, little is really known of Stribogu, except his name. There are no myths or legends that explain his function in the system.
The Slavic pantheon is further complicated by the addition of Iranian elements: the god Xursu, and possibly SimarTglu which may be a copyist’s error for “Sim, a household spirit, and Rigl, a spirit of the harvest.”4 It is even plausible that the Slavic pantheon is an artificial organization of gods drawn from native Slavic sources and scholarly borrowing from Persia. Vladimir may have had a strongreaction to the encroachment of Christianity, and therefore tried to establish a standardized state religion. At any rate, so little is known about the ancient Slavic gods that the researcher must rely heavily upon euhemerization.
There is, however, one piece of terra firma which does directly con¬ cern the gods themselves, and this is a surprisingly clear example of tripartite ordering. In Grunau’s Preussische Chronik of the sixteenth century, there is a description of a tapestry (bannir) that portrays
three heads, two on the top and one on the bottom, looking up at the
and Marc Szeftel, “The Vseslav Epos,” in Russian Epic Studies, Memoirs of the American Folklore Society 42 (1947), where they discuss the intrusion of the folk¬ tale of Volx Vseslav'evid into The Russian Primary Chronicle. This legend appears as the biography of Prince Vseslav of Polock (1044-1101). The hero has been analyzed from an Indo-European tripartite point of view by Dumezil and Yoshida (see Dumezil, op. cit., pp. 625-628). For the south Slavic version of this tale see Gojko Ruziric and Roman Jakobson, “The Serbian Zmaj Ognjeni Vuk and the Russian Vseslav Epos,” AlPhO 10:343-355 (Brussels, 1950). 3 V. N.

others. Patollo (Pickols, Pickollos, and so on) is depicted as an old man with a pale, deathly color; he wore a white cloth over his fore¬ head like a “morbant.”5 He is the one on the bottom. Lucas David (ibid., p. 91) reports that “Patollo or Pickollos” is the most important Prussian deity; he is “the god of death” who has “the power to kill.” “Pocols atque Pocols” is glossed “Pluto, Furiae,” and “Pocclum inferni ac tenebrarum deum” as well as “Pocollom aereorum spirituum
deum,” and “Pocullus deus spirituum volantium sive cacodaemonarum.” Pickollos seems to be derived from the same root as Lithu¬ anian pykstii, “be angry,” a sense that resembles that of Odin (*WoSanaz). Both Varuna and Odin are described as pale, old men—gods of the underworld and death. White is also the color associated with
the first function. The other two figures are: Perkunas, depicted with an angry mien, and Potrimpo, portrayed as a young, beardless man with ears of corn around his head and a happy expression. Perkunas is a well-known counterpart of Thor and Perun. Potrimpo can be none other than the third-function god on a par with Freyr. His name is far less trans¬ parent. Since he is the god of water, rivers, and streams, attempts have been made to divide his name into po, “under,” and *trimpus, “water” (the closest word actually attested in Old Prussian is trumpa,
“fluvius”).6 A search into Nestor’s Russian Primary Chronicle for euhemerized Indo-European myth is rewarding. Nestor sets forth the legendary history of the Kievan state: its earliest beginnings, the reigns and personalities of its first rulers. The question of the historicity of the early kings of Kiev is far from settled. The earliest king, Rurik, is the most hazy, and this haze lifts as the chronicler approaches the time of St. Vladimir. Much of the early history contains a great deal of popular legend, and the chronology of succession is riddled with numerous impossibilities. For example, it is unlikely that Igor’ could
be Rurik’s son because Igor’ is said to have married Olga in 903, al¬ though his own son, Svjatoslav, was not born until 942. More im¬ portant, the second attack of Oleg on Constantinople is another report that is completely unsubstantiated by Byzantine documents. The chronicle hopelessly confuses the dates of Olga’s journey to Byzantium as well as the date of her baptism. At any rate, even if all those rulers are historical, real figures, very little is known of them, and it is obvious that much oral tradition has been draped around

150 Robert L. Fisher, Jr.
these early personages. The exact characterizations of their person¬ alities with exemplifying stories, and their order of succession, are manipulated in such a way as to suggest a euhemerization of some underlying myth. It may also represent an unconscious ordering of fact and tradition “en accord avec le systeme triparti.” Finally, con¬ sidering the long discourses on folk beliefs, portents, apocrypha, and hagiographic miracle lore—all presented as indisputable fact—it
should not be surprising to discover such discrepancies. The legend of the establishment of the Kievan state begins essen¬ tially with an entry under the years 860-862 in the Nestor Chronicle. It was at this time that the disunited Slavic tribes, suffering from internecine conflicts, requested the overlordship of the Varangians in a last-ditch effort to achieve stability: “Our land is rich, but there
is no order in it; come and rule and have dominion over us.”7 The important part of the entry for these years is the designation of Rurik as a ruler of Novgorod and the succession of Oleg upon the other’s death. It is not entirely farfetched to assume that Rurik and Oleg were corulers of Novgorod, as seems to have been a widespread custom among the Scandinavians of that time (cf. Chadwick, op. cit.,
p. 25). If this were the case, then plausibly Rurik and Oleg could be candidates for the same position occupied by Romulus and Remus
when they were the early cosovereigns of Rome. There are other similarities in the two histories. First, Romulus violently wrests control from Remus;8 such violence is not surprising considering the former’s Varunaic nature. Although Rurik dies
peacefully, Oleg, the Varuna figure, does assume sole rulership. Sec¬ ond, Romulus becomes a syncretized personality since the Ramnes (< Remus), a tribe devoted to religious and administrative authority, is said to have been founded by the victorious twin. Parallel to this is the syncretism of many Mitraic traits in the personality of Oleg. By way of contrast, nowhere does the chronicler suggest any change in the basic nature of these two rulers; they were always sovereigns. Whereas, both in Roman tradition and in the Hadingus story, there is a metamorphosis from third- to first-function characteristics of these rulers. So little is known about Rurik, however, that assump¬
tions about his personality are extremely difficult.
7 Cross and Sherbowitz-Wetzor, op. cit., p. 59. Incidentally, this “calling of the princes” has been rejected by most modern scholars on the basis of archaeology and Greek and Orientjil records. Apparently the Scandinavians had entrenched them¬ selves in northern' Russia before the ninth century, and then proceeded south as traders and warriors. For full argument, see pp. 35-50 and 233-234 n. 20. 8 Livy, Early History of Rome, I-IV of The History of Rome from its Founda¬ tion, trans. Aubrey de Selincourt (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1967), p. 24.
Indo-European Elements in Baltic and Slavic Chronicles 151
Nevertheless, what can be reasonably assumed is that Oleg and Rurik were cosovereigns of Novgorod, and that the Varuna figure became the sole ruler upon the death of his partner. There are a number of aspects to the legends concerning Oleg that suggest a Varunaic character. First, there is his singular method of winning battles. Under the years 880-882, Nestor reports that Oleg traveled to Kiev, which at that time was held by Askold and Dir, two Norsemen who were not of Rurik’s clan but had captured the city. Oleg was of Rurik’s clan and was the regent for Igor’, Rurik’s son. Because of his kinship to Rurik, Oleg considered himself to be the rightful ruler. Nestor goes on to relate (Cross and Sherbowitz-Wetzor,
op. cit., p. 6i):
He [Oleg] then came to the hills of Kiev, and saw how Askold and Dir reigned there. He hid his warriors in the boats, left some others behind, and went forward himself bearing the child Igor’ . . .he sent messengers to Askold and Dir, representing himself as a stranger on his way to Greece on an errand for Oleg and for Igor’, the prince’s son, and requesting that they should come forth to greet them as members of their race. Askold and Dir straightway came forth. Then all the soldiery jumped out of the boats, and Oleg said to Askold and Dir, “You are neither princes nor even of princely birth.” “Igor” was then brought forward, and Oleg announced he was the son of Rurik. They killed Askold and Dir.
In this story there is no long siege, no attempt at integrity, and little bloodshed. But there is a trick and a lie. Also, Oleg emphasizes his own princeliness, his sovereignty, his “race.” Oleg calls himself “a stranger,” and there is that irony of his lie because he says he is on a mission for “Oleg and Igor’.” All these elements point clearly to similar features of Varuna and Odin. Just as Odin manipulates war¬ riors, but never enters the actual killing himself, here Oleg merely asserts his authority over Kiev, brushing aside its rulers who seem to stand dumbfounded and paralyzed before his authority. Oleg merely asserts his authority, and without further complications or resistance the city is his. The trick, the lie (especially with ironic overtones) are reminiscent of Odin’s treachery. As does Oleg, Odin frequently ap¬ pears in the guise of a stranger, and “stranger” is one of his epithets. Finally, the very name Oleg is derived from the Old Norse Helgi, “holy,” borne by the Odin-related hero Helgi Hundingsbani.
There are other similar accounts of his nonparticipant manner of fighting and his emphasis on extension of authority rather than war¬ fare. In 885 (ibid., p. 61), “Oleg commanded his warriors to make wheels which they attached to the ships, and when the wind was favorable, they spread the sails and bore down upon the city from



Robert L. Fisher, Jr.
the open country. When the Greeks beheld this, they were afraid, and sending messengers to Oleg, they implored him not to destroy the city and offered to submit to such tribute as he should desire.” Again the actual victory is won more by fear and by ingenuity than by brute force (as the device of the wheeled ships points out). Unlike other rulers of Kiev described later in the chronicle, there is no mention of
Oleg as an actual warrior. Instead, he seems to be more of a director than a participant. Another factor brought out by this story is the blind fury of Oleg and his men which was unleashed on the Greek captives. This trait again recalls Odin (whose name means “fury” and is glossed by Saxo as “furor”). In this same passage, the victorious Oleg, upon his return to Kiev, is called “the Sage” by the people, “for they were but pagans and therefore ignorant.” The word used for “sage” is vescij, from the same root as vede, Indo-European *woyd-, “to know,” but in a supernatural sense. This same adjective is used to describe the magician Boian in the Igor’ Tale. The best translation
is “seer,” “wizard.”9 The final episode that further demonstrates Oleg’s magical nature is the story of his death. He consulted magicians in order to find out how he would die. They foretold that death would come from his horse. He prudently ordered his horse to be taken care of, but never to be brought into his presence. Word came to him years later that his horse had died. He then scoffed at the magicians’ prophecy and went
to inspect the dead horse’s bones. “He laughed and remarked, ‘so I was supposed to receive my death from this skull?’ [a peculiar thing to say, since the skull was never mentioned in the original prophecy], and he stamped upon the skull with his foot. But a serpent crawled forth from it and bit him on the foot, so that he sickened, and died”
(Cross and Sherbowitz-Wetzor, op. cit., p. 69). His death involves a healthy respect for magic and befits a magical sovereign quite well, just as Romulus suffered a magical death or
(better) disappearance (Livy, op. cit., p. 35). As mentioned above, Oleg shows Mitraic characteristics, which may represent his syncretism with Rurik (if the latter ever had such
traits), in much the same way as Romulus and the Ramnes represent a syncretism of the magical and legal aspects of the first function. After his alleged attack and victory over Byzantium, Oleg concluded a peace treaty that is quite striking in its content when contrasted with the treaties drawn up by his successors. While their treaties tend to be mere noriaggression pacts (completely temporary, until more

Indo-European Elements in Baltic and Slavic Chronicles 153
troops can be mustered, as is frequently the case with Igor’), the treaty of Oleg is much broader in scope and much more detailed. It runs on for several pages in the Nestor chronicle (pp. 64—68) and covers mi¬ nutely such items as trade agreements, extradition of criminals, repa¬ ration, mutual assistance, salvage laws for lost ships, inheritance, fine for assault, and the like. The language is legalistic and sophisticated. Furthermore, much emphasis is placed on the sacredness of the oath, which is another Varunaic element. Such phrases as “an inviolable
pledge binding equally on you Greeks and upon us Russes” are fre¬ quent, as are the ideas of “convention,” “covenant,” and “peace.”
In summation, Oleg can be seen as a Varunaic sovereign of magical type based on the fact that he was a coruler of Novgorod with Rurik, that he is a nonparticipant in his wars, that he is called vescij, “wiz¬ ard,” that in many particulars he is close to Odin, and finally, because of his magical death. Oleg also has Mitraic elements as evidenced by his legalistic treaty which is unique among the early Kievan princes.
The next prince of Kiev was the grown-up Igor’. His reign is char¬ acterized by a particularly brutish and monstrous type of warfare which is in sharp contrast to the career of his successor, Svjatoslav, the embodiment of warrior ideals par excellence. Because of this dis¬ tinction, it is best to interpret Igor’ as a Bhlma-Vayu type and Svjato¬ slav more as an Arjuna-Indra type.
Igor’ ascended the throne in 913, and by 914 he had already sub¬ jected the rebellious Derevlians and had imposed a higher tribute than his predecessor, Oleg. Every entry concerning him mentions war in the same breath. Unlike Oleg, he neither enjoyed nor desired peace.
Under 935-941 Nestor recounts Igor’s Greek campaign (Cross and Sherbowitz-Wetzor, op. cit., p. 72): “The Russes . . . began to ravage Bithynia. They . . . laid waste the entire region of Nikomedia, burn¬ ing everything along the gulf. Of the people they captured, some they butchered, others they set up as targets and shot at, some they seized upon, and after binding their hands behind their backs, they drove iron nails through their heads. Many sacred churches they gave to flames, while they burned many monasteries and villages. . . .” After
his narrow escape, Igor’, “upon his return . .. began to collect a great army, and sent many messengers after the Varangian beyond the sea, inviting them to attack the Greeks, for he desired to make war upon them.” In 944 he finally collected this great army and “advanced up¬ on the Greeks . . . thirsting for revenge.” But the Byzantine Emperor managed to buy off the Russian invader and his allies, and Igor’ “bade the Pechenegs to ravage Bulgaria” (ibid., p. 73).

His treaty with the Greeks is a simple document which ends (ibid., p. 76): “May they [the transgressors of the treaty] not be protected by their own shields, but may they be slain by their own swords, laid low by their own arrows or by any of their own weapons, and may they be in bondage forever.” These threats and curses stand out against the more sophisticated Greek stipulations which echo many points
of Oleg’s treaty. After concluding this agreement, Igor’ lived in peace until “autumn came, [when] he thought of the Derevlians, and wished to collect
from them a still larger tribute” (ibid., p. 78). In 945 he sought that extra tribute and “collected it by violence. ...” He returned home loaded with booty, but halfway he had second thoughts; “being desirous of still greater booty, he returned on his
tracks with a few of his followers.” Prince Mai of the Derevlians heard of his return for more tribute. They described Igor’ as a “wolf come among sheep” who “will take away the whole flock one by one, unless he is killed.” They slew Igor’
since he had but a small retinue with him. At this point, Nestor inserts the legend of Olga, Igor’s wife, and her threefold revenge for his murder. This is discussed below, but now it is important only to note that an additional tale whose motif is revenge follows the biography of a prince devoted to savage war¬ fare, torture, ravaging for its own sake, revenge, and the exacting of tribute. On account of these characteristics of the Igor’ legend, it is
best to see him as a Bhlma-Vayu personality. The tone of the reports changes radically with the years 956-964, when Svjatoslav became prince of Kiev. Although his career is ex¬ tremely warlike, Svjatoslav is described as having a “valiant army,” and, “stepping as light as a leopard, he undertook many campaigns.” Typical of Nestor’s new vocabulary is (year 965): “He sallied forth against the Khazars.” His nature is clear; he is a brave warrior—so much so that his sovereignty as prince is almost totally eclipsed. He
eats and lives just like one of his infantrymen (ibid., p. 84): “Upon his expeditions he carried neither wagons nor kettles, and boiled no meat, but cut off small strips of horseflesh, game, or beef, and ate it after roasting it on the coals. Nor did he have a tent, but he spread out a horse-blanket under him, and set his saddle upon his head: and all his retinue did likewise.” He does not employ the sneak attack, but sends messengers, announcing his intention to fight. His bravery is well attested (<771, after a Bulgarian victory): “But Svjatoslav cried to soldiery, ‘Here is where we fall! Let us fight bravely, brothers and companions!’ ” (ibid., p. 87). And once when outnumbered by Greeks

(ibid., p. 88): “Now we have no place whither we may flee. Whether we will or no, we must give battle. Let us not disgrace Rus’, but rather sacrifice our lives, lest we be dishonored. For if we flee, we shall be disgraced. We must not take to flight, but we will resist boldly, and I will march before you. If my head falls, then look to yourselves.” One episode from the same year incontrovertibly demonstrates Svjatoslav’s second-function character. The Emperor took council how he might halt Svjatoslav’s onslaught. First, they tempted him with gifts and gold, but he took no notice and gave the riches to his servants. On the second try, they brought him arms, which he duly admired and praised. The envoys told the Emperor: “This man must be fierce, since he pays no heed to riches, but accepts arms.”
Svjatoslav, fearing a counterattack after his Greek victories, decided to make a peace treaty. It is recorded in a small declaration that does not have the legal bent of Oleg’s, or the fierce curses and threats of Igor’s. It simply states his promise not to attack Greek lands. Curi¬ ously though, he mentions that if anyone breaks the oath, “may we become as yellow as gold” (ibid., p. 90). This may be a reference to the infliction of jaundice by the Slavic equivalent of Varuna for
oath-breaking. Svjatoslav died by the sword in a campaign against the Pechenegs. With consistency, the death is appropriate to the life he led as a war¬ rior. Svjatoslav must be considered a second-function figure because of his love of war, his valor, his preference for arms over riches—all of which sets him apart from the vicious Igor’. In 973 the reign of Jaropolk began. His rule was brief, and he was treacherously assassinated (but the chronology of this part of the chronicle is particularly confused). Jaropolk was a victim in many ways of his aggressive brother Vladimir (later Saint). Jaropolk fled his brother and was besieged for a winter in the city of Rodnya. The chronicle adds: “There was a great famine there, and we have to this day a proverb which speaks of famine as in Rodnya” (ibid., p. 92). Vladimir also stole his brother’s wife who had been brought from Greece and married to Jaropolk “on account of the beauty of her countenance.” Both the famine, the mention of his wife’s beauty, and her abduction have to do with the third function, and in this sense Jaropolk can be seen as its representative. This is scant evidence. One might suggest, however, that the third function would not be pre¬ sented as sovereign. In Roman tradition, the only candidates for a representative of the third function are Ancus Martius and Servius Tullius. The latter seems to be more of a Bhaga-Aryaman sovereign, and the former is concerned with establishing legal boundaries, ad

ministration, and other practicalities, although Rome is said to have prospered during his reign. In Slavic tradition there is no other candidate, since the next king is the historically attested Vladimir who is legenclarily very complex. Perhaps the legends of Jaropolk were overshadowed by those of Vladimir. In the chronicle, Jaropolk seems to be a stepping-stone for Vladimir’s rise to power. At any rate, the case for Jaropolk as a third-function figure is inconclusive.10
In conclusion, the legends of the Nestor Chronicle surrounding the first four kings in the founding of the Kievan state were viewed as a continuation of Indo-European tripartite myth (such as is found in the legends of the early Roman kings), or a tripartite ordering of ancient Slavic lore. The shadowy Rurik had a coruler, Oleg, who dis¬ plays mostly Varunaic features combined with Mitraic, legalistic
10 The jaru in Jaropolk’s name would seem to indicate ‘frenzy,’ but with sexual overtones: German ‘Brunst’ (cf. fupos, ‘strong, fiery, lively,’ most often used with reference to wine, but sometimes also to drugs; Old Russian jaru, ‘streng, herb,’ Serbo-Croatian j'dra, ‘Hitze vom Ofen’). This reference to virility strengthens the case for his third-function character. Thus Jaropolk parallels Oleg in so far as he bears a name characteristic of his function: OITgu is from Old Norse Helgi, ‘holy,’ pointing to his connection with magic. Both second-function figures have less transparent names. Igor’ is < Old Norse Yngvarr < *InguhariR. Yngvi is quoted by J. de Vries as a poetical word for ‘prince, warrior’ (Altnordisches etymologisches Worterbuch [Leiden, 1961], s.v.). Rudolf Much (Die Germania des Tacitus [2d ed.; Heidelberg 1954], p. 53) suggests that Ing(ui) is another name for Freyr on the basis of the name Ingaevones, a maritime tribe among whom Nerthus (Freyr) was especially worshiped. He would segment the word Ing-aevones (<^ *aiwa~, aiwo-, aiwi, Old English d(w), Old Saxon eo, Old High German ewa ‘law, right’), meaning ‘those who follow the law of Ing, the people of the cult of Ing.’ On the other hand, Ing- may be a cog¬ nate of Greek iyxos, ‘spear,’ since both occur in such compound names as Ingimarr (<^*InguimariR) and kyx^ai-pippos, ‘great with the spear, fighting with the spear’ (cf. Gaulish Seg-marus, Old Church Slavic Vladi-meru, and so on). Although Igor’s personality and warrior function are clear, unfortunately the same cannot be said of the origin and meaning of his name. Svjatoslavu < svjatu-, Old Church Slavic svqtu, ‘holy’ (cf. Avestan spgnta-, Lithuanian sventas). Spgnta- would perhaps be best translated as ‘strong, supernaturally powerful.’ (For a detailed summary of the arguments and for a complete list of Baltic, Slavic, and Iranian cognates, see H. W. Bailey, “Iranian Studies III,” BSOS 7:275-298 [1934]). Since this word is used most often for divine beings who are good and beneficial to mankind, the Slavic meaning ‘holy’ is a natural de¬ velopment from an earlier epithet meaning ‘strong, supernaturally powerful.’ Perhaps this connotation of ‘strong’ (of good beings) has found its way to the Arjuna figure here, because he represents the “chivalrous,” "socially acceptable” warrior as opposed to Igor', the sheer embodiment of uncontrolled destruction. I would be inclined to think that the fact of the different linguistic sources of these names (Old Norse and Slavic) does not vitiate the proposal of their semantic unity within a mythological system. Just as the third-function figures may be called the Asvins in one area and the Awcricovpoi in another, so even within a mixed language area the semantic slots may be filled with words from different linguistic traditions.

features. Igor’ appears as a Bhima-Vayu figure, and Svjatoslav as an obvious Arjuna-Indra figure. Jaropolk has some third-function char¬ acteristics, but the evidence is insufficient for any definite conclusion.
There is yet another episode in the Nestor Chronicle in which further Indo-European elements can be seen. This is the story of Ol¬
ga’s triple revenge on the Derevlians for the murder of her husband, Igor’. As was seen above, Igor’ was slain by the Derevlians. His widow was then approached by the Derevlian Prince Mai who asked for her hand in marriage, since he wished “to obtain possession of Svjatoslav, and work [his] will upon him.” Mai sent his “best men, twenty in number” as envoys (ibid., p. 78). Olga welcomed them, stated her will¬ ingness to marry Prince Mai, but added that she wished to honor the envoys the next day before her people. She bade them to refuse to go by horse or on foot, but to insist on being drawn through the city in their boat. That night she had a deep trench dug near the castle. After the envoys had been drawn to the castle and were “puffed up with pride,” their boat was thrown into the ditch and they were buried
alive. This completed the first phase of her revenge. Next she sent a message to the Derevlians, saying that “if they real¬ ly required her presence, they should send their distinguished men,
so that she might go to their prince with due honor, for otherwise her people in Kiev would not let her go.” The Derevlians accordingly “gathered together the best men who governed the land of Dereva, and sent them to her.” Upon their arrival, Olga had a bath prepared for them; they were locked in the bathhouse, which was then set
afire, “so that the Derevlians were all burned to death.” For her final act of revenge, she told the Derevlians that she was on her way and to “prepare great quanities of mead in the city . . . that ... I may hold a funeral feast for him [Igor’]-When the Derevlians were drunk, she bade her followers fall upon them. ... So they cut down 5,000 of them_” Although Olga went on to further revenge by besieging their city the following year (946), this is another story, which is to be kept separate from the legend of her three-leveled scheme to go among the Derevlians under the pretense of a marriage
proposal. This legend shows that Olga brought revenge upon all three social classes: warriors, rulers, common people, in that order. “Best men”
seems to refer to warriors in the first phase of her revenge because, first, they were not used to being treated as rulers, since they were “puffed up with pride” when shown honor. Second, they are specified as twenty handpicked men, not the distinguished men “who governed
the land of Dereva.” Her last victims are the people at large, the



i58 Robert L. Fisher, Jr.
five thousand participants in their own funeral feast.11 This tripartite social scheme is rather straightforward, but the methods of killing the representative members of each social group present problems from an Indo-European point of view. Live burial is usually taken as appropriate to the third function, while death by fire and by the sword belong to the second function. The live burial is exceptional in that it involves the ship. Since there is a strong Scan¬ dinavian influence on the ruling house of Kiev, perhaps here there is a reference to “ship burials in stone barrows on the edge of the sea described in Norse sagas. In such stories it is sometimes said that a man builds for himself a barrow during his lifetime, and that he enters it while he is still alive with his ship’s crew. Frequently in these sagas, we read of the Norse heroes breaking into such barrows, and finding a ship fully manned with a crew richly dressed and laden with treasure, seated, like the Derevlians, on the cross benches’’ (Chadwick, op. cit., p. 29.). Thus, more likely, this episode is con¬
nected with the Scandinavian theme of ship burial, and not with an appropriate form of execution with respect to Indo-European ide¬ ology.
The second execution is by burning, a death that befits the second function, not the first function as here. One can only suggest that since the first function seems to have taken over second-function characteristics in the Slavic world (stress on warrior activity, lack of firmly entrenched priestly class), perhaps it has also taken on the form of second-function execution. Considering the general discon¬ tinuity, however, it seems better not to view the executions as con¬ sistent with an Indo-European outlook.
The last massacre involves the common people. From the fact that it occurs at a feast and involves their drunkenness, a good thirdfunction method of killing would be expected. The story states ex¬
plicitly, however, that the means of death was the sword. In conclusion, Olga’s revenge is truly tripartite since she extends her killings to all three social classes. But the same cannot be said of her methods of execution for each class.
11 Another tripartite death may appear in The Chronicle of Henry of Livonia (Leonid Arbusow and Albert Bauer, Heinrici Chronicon Livoniae [Hannover, 1955]). Bishop Berthold, while consecrating the cemetery at Holm, is the object of a planned murder by the pagans: (p. 9) “alii in ecclesia concremare, alii occidere, alii submergere concfertabant. . . .” There are, however, difficulties. Although the third-function death1 (by drowning) and the second-function death (by fire and sword) are represented, there is no first-function death. Here, since a priest is the potential victim, one would especially anticipate mention of hanging or falling. Nevertheless, it is suspicious that his Livonian parishioners thought of killing him in three ways—two of which, drowning and burning, seem to entail extra effort, since it would have been an easy matter to “cut him down” (occidere).
Aspects of Equine Functionality
JAAN PUHVEL, University of California, Los Angeles
From early Europe, the Near East, and Western Asia we possess an immense amount of archaeological, antiquarian, ethnographic, myth¬ ological, and folkloristic material concerning the horse. In the face of this welter of data, Indo-Europeanists concerned with mythic and religious matter must apply severe methodical selectivity in order to winnow structurally significant information from the mass of raw material. It is hence my purpose in this paper to pursue the role of the horse as an integral component of such Indo-European mythic
and religious structures as are congruent with a tripartite concept of social and religious organization, and to eschew the pitfalls of uni¬
versal or diffusional accordances. Not much has been accomplished so far on the specific subject that interests us. Collections of antiquarian lore,1 ethnographic treatises,2 and paleological investigations3 are not primarily concerned with Indo-European protocivilization in its mythic and religious aspects. The only viable starting point in past research is a kind of triptych depicting Indo-European horse sacrifice, the centerpiece of which is the well-documented and much-studied Ancient Indie asvamedha
ritual. One side panel is composed of the Roman October Equus as interpreted by Georges Dumezil, the other by Celtic analogues first adduced by Franz Rolf Schroder. A critical study of these composi¬ tions is needed as a basis for further forays. All other stray informa

tion concerning horse sacrifice among Indo-Europeans must take a
back seat until this is accomplished. The asvamedha is exceedingly well endowed with descriptive and exegetic matter. Apart from such Rig-Vedic hymns as 1.162 and 1.163, Paul-Emile Dumont treated the relevant White Yajur-Vedic (Vajasaneyi Samhitd, Satapatha Brahmana, Katyayana Srautasutra) texts in his book L’Asvamedha (Paris, 1927), adding material from three Black Yajur-Vedic Srautasutra’s (Apastamba, Baudhayana, Vadhiila) and from Mahabharata, Book 14 (Asvamedhikaparvan), and later performed the same service for the Black Yajur-Vedic variants of the Taittirvya Brahmana.4 Further editorial work was done by Shrikrishna Bhawe.5 Any number of more general works6 afford a summary description.
The a’svarnedha is a ritualistic production with a cast of thousands, incorporating many acljutory rites and representing in a sense the sum of Ancient Indie sacrificial pageantry. Trying to strip away excrescences, the central proceedings may be summarized as follows: The start of the rite was made in the spring, with the king as patron and the four main priests (adhvaryu, hotar, udgatar, and brahman) as officiators. During the preliminary celebrations the king
had to spend the night chastely with his favorite wife by the garhapatya or domestic fire. A prize stallion was selected as the prospec¬ tive victim and subjected to a number of ceremonies, including sprinkling in a pool, at which time a dog was killed and thrown under it. The stallion was then set free to roam, accompanied by a hundred gelded or aged horses and four hundred young men of different castes who were to guide it toward the northeast and keep it from contact with mares and from further immersion in water. This
roaming took a whole year, and in the meantime a number of pre¬ paratory rituals took place at home. Toward the end of the year a huge fire-altar was erected, and the king underwent a seven- or twelveday initiation (diksa) involving fasting and other observances. During
this time the entire stage was prepared, including a new hearth for the garhapatya fire and the procurement and installation of the soma-supply. The main ritual took three days. On the principal, second day of sacrifice the king drove in a war chariot drawn by the sacrificial stallion and three other horses. The victim was anointed

by the three foremost wives of the king, and its mane and tail were fitted with 101 pearls. The sacrifice took place at twenty-one stakes, the three principal victims being the stallion, a hornless ram, and a he-goat. Altogether 366 or 6og victims were prescribed (according to Taittiriya and Vajasaneyi sources, respectively), but the wild beasts among them were released rather than killed. The stallion was smothered to death, whereupon the mahisl or chief queen symbolical¬
ly cohabited with it under covers, while the entourage engaged in obscene banter. Then followed the cutting up of the victim, disposal of the parts, further blood sacrifices, ablutions, and disbursement of
priestly honoraria. In the Satapatha Brahmana and in several Srautasutra’s the asva¬ medha description is accompanied by what in most respects amounts to a summary replication of its ritual in the form of human sacrifice. This purusamedha involved the procuring of a brahmana or ksalriya victim by purchase from his family for a thousand cows and a hun¬ dred horses. After initial rites he was set free for a year and humored in everything except sexual indulgence. The ritual itself took five days, versus three for the asvamedha. The victim was adorned and throttled on the second day much like the horse, together with a hornless ram and a he-goat. The liturgy was taken mostly from the Purusasukta and the funeral hymns of the tenth mandala of the RigVeda. The queen had intercourse with the dying or dead victim. Rather than a menagerie of animals, an accompanying human massa¬ cre was prescribed, which in some sources reached 184 persons of all
social strata. What was the relationship of these two rituals? Oldenberg and others saw in the puruyamedha a figmental replication of the asva¬ medha, thus disclaiming its historical reality. It is evident that to the Brahmanic and Sutric compilers the purusamedha was a somewhat unreal appendage to the horse sacrifice, almost a theoretical after¬
thought. In epic and classical literature there is no instance of its performance, except for the preposterous statement in Mahabharata
1 -3773 that Ayutanayin performed ten thousand purusamedha’s. The Pali Canon repeatedly rejects both asvamedha and puruyamedha, but this occurs in a blanket condemnation of all bloody sacrifices.
The historical purusamedha was thus at best obsolete, at worst un¬
real. Willibald Kirfel, in his article in the Walther Schubring dedi¬ cation volume,7 has made a case for the historicity of the puruyamedha as a one-time practical means of actually begetting a royal

heir when for some reason the king was unable to do so. Kirfel brings medical evidence for reflex-conditioned tumescence and emission in victims of hanging and decapitation and assumes a similar set of cir¬ cumstances in the cohabitation of the mahisl and the purufa. Thus the asvamedha would appear to be rather a substitute sacrifice for the purusamedha, with the symbolic element prevailing. Yet matters
are not so simple, nor does Kirfel assume them to be. In the classical asvamedha the king is triumphantly in charge, as dedicant to Prajapati, the Lord of Creation, and the whole performance is guaranteed to make him victorious, sinless, happy, and glorious, as in Yudhisthira’s great ritual in Mahdbharata 14. The cohabitation part, with the queen in the star role, is somehow extraneous to the central concept, although occasionally childlessness propels the sacrifice, as with King Dasaratha in Ramayana 1. Kirfel assumes that the horse ritual of the invading Indo-Aryans fused on Indie soil with an agri¬ cultural fertility rite involving human sacrifice. The horse supplanted the human victim in the resulting conflation, yet the traits of the Pre-Aryan rites came to dominate the end product. Koppers dis¬ tinguished what he called “Southern” elements in the asvamedha from Indo-European-based inner-Asian imports, and it is those that would mainly correspond to the indigenous purusamedha features as¬
sumed by Kirfel. We may grant Kirfel that the total asvamedha is a specifically Indie product. That it contains Pre-Aryan matter is well possible, but I find less convincing the specific assumption that IndoEuropean horse sacrifice and Pre-Aryan human sacrifice were con¬ flated in such a way that the result was predominantly horse oriented in form but wholly Pre-Aryan in sacrificial and sexual substance. In short, I admit that there were transformations in the Indie horse sacrifice away from an Indo-European prototype, but not that the latter necessarily excluded connections with human sacrifice or
sexual practice. Let us turn now to one of the side panels of the previously men¬ tioned triptych. That the Roman October Equus is a reflection of an Indo-European ritual of horse sacrifice has long been assumed, but Dumezil has made the comparison with India more plausible and precise.8 As pieced together from Polybius, Plutarch, Festus, and
Paulus Diaconus, the Roman ritual may be summarized as follows: After a horserace on the Campus Martius on the Ides of October, the right-side horse qf the victorious chariot was immolated to Mars with a spear. The people of Suburra and of the Sacra Via fought over the

head of the horse; if the former caught it, they fixed it on the wall of the Tunis Mamilia; if the latter, on that of the Regia. The tail was carried speedily to the Regia, and drops of blood from the tail were
sprinkled on its hearth. There are important differences from the asvamedha, notably the manner of killing and the absence of the erotic element. But there are also broad similarities, for example, the dedication to Mars in Rome and the clear anteriority of Indra to Prajapati as the one-time
recipient of the asvamedha (see e.g., Koppers, op. cit., p. 337). and further the patronage of the kfatriya-raja in India and the role of the Regia in Rome. There are further specific accordances of the curious
type that tends to exclude chance, such as the designation of the equus bigarum victricum dexterior in Rome and the Saiapatha Brahmana injunction (13.4.2.1) that the asvamedha victim must
“excel on the right part of the yoke,” or the role of the horse’s tail in
both rituals.9 A similar singularity has been pointed out by Dumezil in “Quaestiuncula Indo-Italica 17.”10 Dio Cassius (43.24.2—4) describes how, as a result of a mutiny of troops in Rome in 46 b.c., Caesar had one ring¬ leader summarily executed, whereupon two others were ritually killed on the Campus Martius by the pontiffs and the Flamen Martialis, and their heads deposited in the Regia. In these proceedings it seems that Caesar, in preparation for assuming royal power, was re¬ viving an obsolescent ritual of human sacrifice which was a replica¬ tion of the October Equus. It places the relationship of asvamedha and purusamedha in a truer light, to the extent of indicating that in
an Indo-European warrior-class horse sacrifice the substitution of a human victim for the horse was possible. Thus the horse sacrifice was not a toning down of the human sacrifice; rather the human victim represented an upgrading of the rite, a Potenzirung, as Al¬ brecht Weber long ago described the purusamedha in his article “Ober Menschenopfer bei den Indern der vedischen Zeit.”11
Now for the other side panel. It is best subsumed in the words of the outraged Geraldus Cambrensis in his Topographia Hibernica (ca.
a.d. 1185), which Schroder first collocated with the asvamedha:12
There is in a northern and remote part of Ulster, among the Kenelcunil, a certain tribe which is wont to install a king over itself by an excessively savage and abominable ritual. In the presence of all the people of this

land in one place, a white mare is brought into their midst. Thereupon he who is to be elevated, not to a prince but to a beast, not to a king but to an outlaw, steps forward in beastly fashion and exhibits his bestiality. Right thereafter the mare is killed and boiled piecemeal in water, and in the same water a bath is prepared for him. He gets into the bath and eats of the flesh that is brought to him, with his people standing around and sharing it with him. He also imbibes the broth in which he is bathed, not from any vessel, nor with his hand, but only with his mouth. When this is done right according to such unrighteous ritual, his rule and sovereignty are consecrated.
Here is something that was consummated in the full Middle Ages in the Celtic hinterlands on a far fringe of the Indo-European world. Its principal ties to the a'svamedha have often been affirmed since
1927, and I would reiterate what I wrote back in 1955,13 that the Gaulish Arvernian royal name Epomeduos is synonymous with the royal name Asvamedha in the Rig-Veda (5.27.4-6) and is the same type of exocentric compound (the Indie bahuvrihi Asvamedha being anterior to the descriptive tatpiimsa name of the ritual). I am inter¬ ested to find that V. V. Ivanov and V. N. Toporov14 present this col¬ location as unchallenged and unreferenced fact. The ritual sacrifice of a horse may well have been a pan-Celtic Indo-European inheri¬ tance, a royal rite that was part of a consecration ceremony. In this
respect it should belong with the Inclic rajasuya rather than the asvamedha proper, and there are other differences as well. The coi
tional element is there, but among the Celts it involves the king and a mare, versus the queen and a stallion in India. In the flush of collo¬ cation this discrepancy has been overlooked or de-emphasized, and I read with surprise: “Mit Recht bemerkt Schroder, dass es ohne Belang ist, wenn im irischen Ritus im Vergleich zum indischen die Rollen vertauscht sind: hier Konigin und Hengst, dort Konig und Stute.”15 I think that this difference is far from inconsequential and in fact provides us with a wedge for penetrating from the ritualistic to the mythological level in dealing with Indo-European equine
tradition. There is ample reason to suspect a hierogamous mating as the mythical underpinnings of the horse sacrifice.16 The nature of this mating is clearly discernible in Celtic traditions and involves a repre¬ sentative of the second or warrior function with the transfunctional

goddess figure. This figure has paled in Indie tradition, apart from its epicized survival in Draupadi as the consort of the Pandavas, but is eminently present in the Iranian Anahita, to whom various heroes in her Yast (Yast 5) sacrifice “a hundred stallions, a thousand cattle, ten thousand sheep.” Their recipient is the trifunctional Arodvi Sura Anahita (“Moist, Heroic, Immaculate”), whose set of epithets proba¬ bly hides the Iranian counterpart of the Vedic goddess Sarasvatl, that is, *Harahvati, ‘rich in waters,’ which survives in the name of the province of Arachosia.17 It seems likely that horses represented a warrior-function offering to Sura, cattle (not specifically bulls) a third-estate tribute to Aradvl, and sheep were an appropriate firstfunction sacrifice to Anahita. Similarly in the Roman suovetaurilia the bull was sacrificed to Mars, the pig to Tellus (Earth), and the
sheep to Jupiter, although the whole rite is oriented toward Mars. The bull, ram, and boar figure in the Greek trittyes (offered to Posei¬ don, Apollo, Asklepios, the Dioscuri, and others), while the Indie sautramani (dedicated to Indra Sutraman) was made up of bull, ram,
and he-goat, sacrificed to Indra, Sarasvatl, and the Asvins, respective¬ ly. Thus, as long as the horse figures on the triple list for the second function, the third level exhibits either cattle (as with Anahita) or goat (in the asvaviedha), with the sheep or hornless ram in the firstfunction position. The bull is in complementary distribution with the horse, for when it appears in the second-function spot, it is to the
exclusion of the horse, whereas the third level shows goat or pig. The same goddess can be traced in the East Slavic Mokos (‘Moist,’ cf. Russ, mokryj) and in Mati Syra Zemlja ‘Mother Moist Earth.’ In
the Celtic area the presence of such a figure is preeminent, and in several varieties. The Gaulish Terra Mater and the three Matres or Matrae or Matronae, in whom I suspect a trifunctional triad, are matched in insular tradition by the divine ancestress Irish Danu, Welsh Don, and especially by the goddess Eriu, with whom every king of Tara was symbolically wedded in a conferral of sovereignty. In most manifestations this goddess figure exhibits manifold equine elements. The Gaulish Epona (Regina) of mostly monographic fame as a riding or horse-surrounded goddess, and her legendary Mabinogi counterpart Rhiannon < *Rigantona, ‘Queen,’ are subject to sus¬
picions of original hippomorphism.18 The Irish goddess Madia of Ulster, or rather the three so-named figures, are a textbook case of a trifunctional female deity in some

what euhemerized triple transmission. Their tales are preserved
chiefly in the story of the sickness of the Ulstermen and in the Rennes
Dindsenchas, and are conveniently summarized in several recent treat¬
ments.19 The first Macha was a prophetess and wife of Nemed mac
Agnomain, a druidic figure connected with the word for “shrine.”
The second Macha was the daughter of Aed Ruad (“The Red”), her¬
self called Mongruad, ‘Red-maned.’ Her father had contracted with
two other kings, Dithorba and Cimbaeth, that each should reign
supreme for seven years in the framework of a triumvirate. On Aed’s
death Macha claimed for herself his due term of sovereignty, made
her claim stick by force of arms, and ruled for seven years. She was
finally killed by Rechtaid Rigderg, whose name also reeks of the red
color symbolism of the warrior class.
The third Macha, wife of Crunniuc mac Agnomain, was forced by
King Conchobar of Ulster to a race against horses, while in the last
stages of pregnancy. She won, then immediately gave birth to twins,
and died uttering a curse on the Ulstermen which led to their annual
so-called childbed sickness.
This splitting of the one Macha into three distinct personalities is
symptomatic of tensions within the trifunctional system. I cannot
subscribe to Dumezil’s claim that the second Macha represents the
conflict of warriors with the first function; it is rather that the war¬
riors’ relationship with the trifunctional goddess has gone sour, from
mating to hostility, as it is apt to do in Irish lore. But the cruelty of
Conchobar to the third Macha, like the indignities suffered by Rhian
non, is directly relatable to the Western Indo-European mythical
tensions embodied in the Norse Aesir-Vanir conflict, the Fomorian
troubles in Ireland, and the Sabine War. For it is undeniable that
the transfunctional goddess exerts a particular hegemony over the
third function and is thus caught in the middle of any conflict op¬
posing the third to the others. As Macha shows, this goddess is the
mother of twins, and we might recall that the third-function horse¬
men twins of India, the Asvins, also had some trouble with Indra
before their admission to the upper-class soma-sacrifice.
The activities that led to split personalities in the case of Macha
are visible elsewhere among the Celtic avatars of the transfunctional
goddess. The names of Cuchulainn’s three divine instructresses,
Scathach (‘Modest’), her daughter Uathach (‘Terrible’), and Aife
(‘Handsome’), sopnd suspiciously trifunctional. That they are aspects
of one and the same goddess it made clear by Uathach’s advice that
18 E.g., Gricourt, ibid., pp. 25-30; Dumezil, RHR 146:5-17 (1954); de Vries, op. cit., p. 128.
Aspects of Equine Functionality 167
Cuchulainn should at swordpoint wring from Scathach a triple set of
boons: instruction in warfare, Uathach’s hand in wedlock, and a fore¬
telling of his future, for Scathach was also a prophetess.20 For what
it is worth, I add this straw to Dumezil’s trifunctional stack.
The figure of Medb is, if I may say so, the euhemerized Celtic
super-Matrona, a sovereignty-conferring warrior-harridan and foun¬
tain of sexuality alike, whose nearest undebased parallels are the
warrior goddesses Morrigu and Badb. Her relation to the former is
evident from the fact that Medb and Morrigu both figure as inter¬
changeably active in various versions of the prelude to the Tain, and
diverse bird symbolisms tie her closely to the ornithomorphic Badb.21
Her taurine fixation on the Donn of Cooley does not obliterate her
horse symbolism. Thus her lover Fergus was known as Ro-ech, ‘Big
Horse,’ and the third of her four husbands (besides Conchobar of
Ulster, Tinne of Connacht, and Ailill of Leinster) was named
Eochaid, a name also borne by the two husbands of Tailtiu, the di¬
vine nurse of the god Lug who closely resembles firiu herself. The
name Eochaid may be connectible with Old Irish ech, ‘horse,’ and
with the epithetal string Eochu Ollathir Ruadrofessa ‘Horse, All¬
father, Red Great Sage’ that characterizes the god Dagda. I doubt
that Medb’s name means simply ‘intoxication’ or the like, and would
rather interpret it as a Celtic *Medua, uncompounded feminine
parallel to the Arvernian Epomeduos, much as Badb corresponds to
the Gaulish Cathubodua. The linguistic history would be the fol¬
lowing: While the Indie name Asva-medha- contains either an IE *mad-dho- or *mey-dho- (cf. madati, ‘be drunk,’ or mayas-, ‘strength’),
a Proto-Celtic *Ekwo-medu- would contain IE *medhu, ‘mead,’
‘ritual beverage,’ hence ‘ritual involving drunkenness,’ and the -o
or -a- of Epomeduos or the abstracted *Medua is a samasanta suffix
characterizing the compound as a whole. It is therefore methodically
incorrect to compare Medb directly with Welsh meddw as a thematic
Celtic adjective *medwo- derived from *medu. I therefore submit
that in Celtic tradition there exist traces not only of the royal sacrifice
of and mating with a mare performed by kings who sometimes bore
the name *Ekwomeduos, but also of a ritual myth of the mating of
the transfunctional goddess, sometimes called * (Ekwo-)medua, with
a probably hippomorphous second-function representative. The off¬
spring of such mating was a set of divine twins, typically of third
estate character.

I am, of course, taking a calculated risk in awarding so much pri¬ macy to the Celtic material. The voice of caution would remind me that very little is known about a transfunctional goddess in the Ro¬ man, Germanic, and Indie pantheons, that the whole Aegean and Near Eastern area swarmed with goddess types that could influence the Iranian cults, and that some autochthonous survival might ac¬
count for the proliferation of the Celtic Matronae. Yet I think that the very strong tripartite structuring of the Iranian and Celtic data argues for their primacy. The absence of the sexual element in Ro¬ man horse sacrifice is no surprise, for early Roman ritual is exceeding¬ ly nonerotic, in probable overreaction to Etruscan overinclulgence. The transfunctional goddess, however, exists in Roman religion as Juno Seispes, Mater, Regina at Lanuvium, as Dumezil has pointed out.22 In the Germanic pantheon, the complications caused by the sharp Aesir : Vanir dichotomy and the sexual ambivalence of the Vanir have wrought transfunctional havoc. Traces of the goddess no doubt survive in the Tacitean Nerthus and the masculinized Norse Njordr, whose career combines both Vanir and Aesir periods and is
euhemerized in Saxo’s figure of Hadingus.23 In India the epic survival of the goddess in Draupadi is proof enough, and her disappearance
from the pantheon is part and parcel of the trend that reduces god¬ desses to vague echoes of their consorts, onomastically and otherwise. She is doubtless present in Sarasvatl, and the latter’s receipt of the ram offering in the sautramani shows that her transfunctionality once reached all the way to the first function, like that of Anahita.
Let us return now to the asvamedha. We can at this point better appreciate why the ritual does not check out well, mythically speak¬ ing. The reason is that it has been cut adrift from the cult myth that
once explained its meaning. In compulsive ancient Rome this was no serious matter, for ritual petrifacts were readily perpetuated there in a vacuum. But the asvamedha must have floundered, ever since at some point its prototype ceased to depict the ritual union of king and goddess, owing probably to a downgrading of the goddess. The king’s role as the patron of a great horse festival persisted, the detail was elaborated and absorbed Pre-Aryan matter, not of a purusamedha type, but rather the typical Near Eastern ritual union of queen or goddess and beast. The usual bull of those rituals has, however, not supplanted the horse, or there would be no asvamedha. The IndoEuropean pattern of theriomorphic hierogamy was clearly King and
Mare, the Near Eastern and Aegean one Queen and Bull (e.g., Eu
22 Eranos 52:105-119 (1954). 23 See Dumezil, La Saga de Hadingus (Paris, 1953).
Aspects of Equine Functionality 189
ropa, Pasiphae in Cretan saga, wife of Archon Basileus in Greek re¬ ligion, and so on). The Indie asvamedha is thus a halfway house of
transformation. This ritualistic enactment of the hierogamic myth, even in the transmuted asvamedha form, redounded to the weal of the canonical¬ ly constituted total society, as subsumed in the whisperings of the adhvaryu into the ear of the victim during the preparatory cere¬ monies: blessings were to accrue successively to priesthood (brah¬ man), royalty (rastra), cow, ox, horse, woman, chariot fighter, and youth; male offspring, rain, plentiful ripe fruit, and peaceful enjoy¬ ment were to result. Dumezil24 has not only elucidated the detail of this tripartite listing but has compared it with Italic formulae like the Umbrian nerf arsmo ueiro pequo castruo frif, ‘heroes, priesthood, men and beasts, fields and fruits’ (cf. the corresponding lexical petri¬ facts of the type Avestan pasu-vira, Vedic vira-p's-a-) and with Varro’s division of human activity on analogous lines.25 It is highly likely that such pandemic lists played an ancient part in Italic lore and be¬ longed to the ritual that we still imperfectly glimpse in the October
Equus. Traces of the Inclic cult myth probably survive in the traditions concerning Saranyu and her offspring. The basic texts from the Rig-Veda (10.17.1), Yaska (Nirukta 12.10), and Saunaka (Brhaddevata 6.162-7.7) were discussed by Maurice Bloomfield,26 to which A. Blau added the corresponding Puranic itihasa's.27 More recently H. Lommel has reexamined the material.28 In brief summary, Tvastar had twin children, Saranyu and Trisiras. The latter was the three-headed monster that came to grief at Trita Aptya’s hands but does not figure further in this myth. Saranyu married Vivasvat and bore twins, Yama
and Yarn!. She then created a double of herself, Savarna, left the chil¬ dren in her care, and fled in the form of a mare. Vivasvat mistook Savarna for his wife and begot Manu. When Vivasvat later realized that the real Saranyu had left as a mare, he changed himself into a stallion, found her, and begot on her the twin Asvins.
The novelistic Puranic elaborations need not concern us here; what matters is that a rather primal goddess, a daughter of the demiurge Tvastar, or her double, is the mother of three sets of deities: Yama and Yarn!, Manu, and the Asvins. Yam! beside Yama, known only
from their samvadana (Rig-Veda 10.10), like the Iranian Yamik be

side Yam, may be merely a folkloristic foil to her bi other.29 Yama
himself, like the Iranian Yima Xsaeta, the son of Vivahvant, does
mean ‘Twin’ and can be reconstructed beyond Proto-Indo-Iraman,
in view of the Tacitean Germanic anthropogonic deities Tuisto,
‘Twin’ and Mannus. Tuisto is “terrae editus,” Mannus his son. A
primal relationship is thus not excluded, and possibly in the proto¬
myth Yama-Manu and Tuisto-Mannus were the twins born of a pri¬
mal goddess. This goddess may well have been a Germanic equivalent
of the Celtic earth mother Tailtiu, and the horse form was thus one
of her manifestations. It is not impossible that a fission and duplica¬
tion of a uniform prototype involving a mating of god and polyvalent
goddess in horse form, and the production of hippomorphic issue of
the third estate, should be postulated. Twins tend to multiply, and
thus the grouping that we see in the Saranyu myth finds its cumula¬
tive explanation. Whether the Germanic Alcis-twins of Tacitean at¬
testation should also be adduced I cannot say. In any event let us
remember that the Asvins have alternative parents (Nasatya, the
Asvin proper, has Sumakha, and Dasra is the son of Dyauh [Div6
n&pat]). Thus it is not so much the detail of the offspring that matters
as the whole hippomorphous situation. It is noteworthy that the
goddess is the one who primarily appears in horse form, in confor¬
mity with the postulated Indo-European pattern.
Much as one may in the Greek Dioscuric traditions vaguely glimpse
a great deal that reminds one of the Indo-European Divine Twins,
even so there is a vast amount of roughly relevant horse mythology
particularly associated with Poseidon. Yet, since this presentation has
as its theme functionality on an Indo-European level, and since the
Greek pantheon is not so readily analyzable, detailed structuring
would be gratuitous. With regard to the Saranyu myth let us merely
be mindful of its curious similarities with the Arcadian tale of Dem¬
eter Erinys and her mating as a mare with Poseidon Hippios, produc¬
ing a daughter Despoina and the horse Areion.30 Other variants exist,
also involving Poseidon and a Boeotian Erinys bearing the horse
Areion whom Herakles used against Kyknos, and Poseidon and Me¬
dusa producing Pegasos whom Bellerophontes rode against the Chi
maira.31 On the rebound from Adalbert Kuhn’s etymological
identification of Saranyu- with’Epirus,32 one should be very careful
about V. Pisani’s fresh attempt to connect BeXXcpo^orrjjs with Vptra

han.33 It is also easy to think of Ixion’s union with the Hera double
Nephele (‘Cloud’) in connection with the Savarna (Puranic Chaya,
‘Shadow’), and of the birth of Kentauros who mated with mares to
produce the race of Centaurs. All this is singularly inconclusive, as
is the slender Greek evidence for horse sacrifice.34 The Dioscuri have
their own lrippomorphism and attendant traditions which are equal¬
ly difficult to evaluate. In short, Greece disappoints the comparativist.
No other branch of Indo-European affords significant answers that
I know of. In the context of this study, little of structural significance
can be garnered from the stray attestations of horse sacrifice or other
sacral equine lore among the Iranians (including Scythians), Thra¬
cians (such as Spartacus’ killing of his war-horse in extremis),'35
Illyrians, Balts, Slavs, and Germanic peoples (e.g., the well-known
manipulation of a horse phallus in the Old Norse Volsi-rite). Cata¬
logues of such data have often been assembled (e.g., by Negelein, Koppers, and Capozza, opera cit.) but remain repositories of ethno¬
logical curiosities rather than mythical matter.
Sometimes, however, there are tantalizing questions. For example,
why does the Hittite Law Code expressly exempt from punishment
bestiality with horses or mules, after sternly penalizing such practice
with cattle, sheep, and pigs? The horse is not an attested sacrificial
animal in Hittite religion, except perhaps at burials. Such discrimina¬
tion is strange when confronted with the sweeping injunction of
Leviticus 20.15: “And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put
to death, and ye shall slay the beast.” What is the relation of this
Hittite attitude to the horse deity Pirwa? It is of uncertain gender and
etymology but definitely related in name to Hittite pirwa-, peru(na)-,
‘rock,’ whether of Hattie origin (pir-, ‘stone’) or of Indo-European
provenance (Sanskrit pdrva(n)-, parvata-, and so on). Nothing func¬
tionally viable can be extracted from these data.
The only one who has attempted some sort of functional summary
of the horse in Indo-European religion is Dumezil.30 He finds the
horse heavily connected with the Varuna half of sovereignty but
absent from the Mitra half. Yet “Mars” (i.e., Tiw) in Germany did
receive horse sacrifices (Koppers, op. cit., p. 286), and “Mars
Thincsus” was certainly the Germanic juridical sovereign of the
Mitra type. At the warrior level Dumezil finds the horse reigning

supreme, with some competition from the bull, whereas the ass seems
to replace the horse at the third-estate level.
I have a feeling that Dumezil has stayed too much on symbolistic
ground and in this instance abstained from mythological analysis. It
would be easy enough to go on collecting materials on such lines, for
example, trying to distinguish functionally oracular horse, war-horse,
and workhorse (or death mount, at the third-function level), and to
speculate on possible color symbolism in white coursers, bay steeds,
and black horses, respectively. I have chosen a divergent tack and
hope that it will prove to be a horse of a different color: in brief, the
basic Indo-European equine myth involves the mating of a kingship
class representative with the hippomorphous transfunctional goddess,
and the creation of twin offspring belonging to the level of the third
estate.
The Divine Victim: Aspects of Human
Sacrifice in Viking Scandinavia
and Vedic India
JAMES L. SAUVE, University of California, Los Angeles
1.
The study of Ancient Indie and Scandinavian mythology requires a
special comparativistic approach. This approach involves a typology
that seeks to resolve the comparativistic problems stemming from the
wide temporal and spatial separation of the historical periods and
places under examination. The relative chronology of Vedic India
and Viking Scandinavia permits taxonomic juxtaposition, even
though the two temporal loci are separated by an absolute time gulf
of about two millennia. The terms “relative” and “absolute,” as em¬
ployed above in their sense proper to typology, express the chrono¬
logical credibility of confronting Vedic India (ca. 1000 b.c.) and
Viking Scandinavia ( ca. a.d. 1000) almost as though their historical
situations were the same. In an absolute chronology the two periods
are, strictly speaking, beyond comparison, but relatively they are yet
comparable because they represent mutually analogous develop¬
mental phases. For the purposes of typologically describing and
naming mythohistorical phenomena, it is permissible to regard the
two ages as artificially synchronic. This synchronization is justifiable
by its heuristic possibilities. Among the latter is the eventuality that
features may be disclosed in a relevancy that may otherwise escape
attention, and that genetically related or relatable factors can be
rendered accessible to scientific scrutiny.

Information on pagan Scandinavian human sacrifice survives
mainly in historical accounts by foreigners, Eddie allusions to myth¬
ological details, the saga literature, and the Gesta Danorum of Saxo
Grammaticus. Eyewitness accounts recall the physical reality of the
sacrifices and recount aspects of their execution. There exist also the
poetic reflections of what are probably real emanations of a religious
outlook that embraced human sacrifice. Finally, there is the more or
less legendary information contained in Saxo’s quasi-history. Because
Germanic paganism was not merely superseded but was extirpated
by Christianity, we know nothing firsthand of the pagan ritual or
cult. The barbaric ritual knowledge was doubtless suppressed im¬
mediately by the missionaries and proselytes of the invading religion.
Ritual “science” is the effective support of the total religion in all
cases known to me, and this ritual arsenal must be disarmed as soon
as possible by the overthrowers in the course of a religious conversion.
The ancient religious converters strove to destroy heathen cultic
paraphernalia and idols. It is not surprising, therefore, that all au¬
thentic pagan Norse ritual knowledge was obliviated.
Vedic religion was never suppressed, and throughout the Indie
evolutions very ancient and archaic elements were transformed, re¬
oriented, and variously perpetuated. Some elements were perpetuated
virtually unmodified in their primitive form, although their orienta¬
tion within the religious consciousness may have become displaced.
These more or less archaic survivals provide valuable testimony of
early practices. The authentic ritual literature, which lacks an exact
counterpart in the Norse tradition, is our principal source for the
comparativistic data used in this study. This early ritual literature
contains actual prescriptive information for application in the priest¬
ly performance of the purusamedha or human sacrifice. We are for¬
tunate that the purusamedha is ritually documented, because this
important rite can offer abundant clues to possible interpretations of
laconic accounts of human sacrifice in non-Indic traditions. The
purusamedha was an even more powerful and efficacious rite than
the already tremendously powerful (and expensive) asvamedha or
horse sacrifice. The only loftier sacrifice ever named is the sarva
medha, the all-sacrifice, which was doubtless largely or entirely
livresque and was probably conceived as a hyperbolic epitome of the
asvamedha and purusamedha. Extensive evidence indicates that the
latter two sacrifices were historically real and performable. The epics
and mythological sources provide sufficient evidence pointing to the
one-time existence of human sacrifice among the Vedic Aryans.
The Divine Victim 115
The disposition of the Indie data is significantly different from
that of the Scandinavian records. In ancient Scandinavia the actual
practice of religious human sacrifice is historically attested beyond
doubt, but no genuine Norse ritual texts survive. On the other hand,
the extant Indie ritual texts detailing the purusamedha contain in¬
ternal evidence showing that the practice of human sacrifice was al¬
ready obsolete or obsolescent at the time of their composition. The
Indie and Scandinavian records contrast meaningfully for the typolo
gist. The problem of the historical significance of human and animal
sacrifice in ancient India has provoked various reactions among
scholars. Whether any ground has been gained toward its resolution
remains to be evaluated and demands comparativistic attention. In
1897 J. Eggeling wrote:1
With regard to the earliest phase of Vedic religion, there is no direct evidence to show that the horse-sacrifice was already at that time a recog¬ nized institution. . . . Seeing, however, that animal sacrifices generally are not alluded to in the Riksamhita, whilst there is every reason to believe that they were commonly practised from remote antiquity, this absence of earlier positive evidence regarding the horse-sacrifice cannot be taken as proving the later origin of that institution . . . there are sufficient indi¬ cations to show that even human sacrifices were at one time practised among the Aryans of India, as they were among their European kinsmen.
Today we can affirm that a horse sacrifice was indeed current in Indo
European times, and we can also be quite certain that the silence of
the Rig-Veda is by no means authoritative or constraintive. Eggel
ing’s statements represent a sober and reasoned standpoint which
we can now afford to amplify.
The individual dispositions of the early Indie and Scandinavian
records seem incongruent. Nevertheless, symbolic coherencies exist
in comparable patterns, and it is these symbolic elements that I am
investigating.
I have purposely left out of account the comparison of Rig-Veda
10.90, the Purusasukta, with the cosmogonic slaughter of the giant
Yrnir as told in Norse mythology, simply because it is necessary to
define what was meant by the immolation of a man, and to discover
the efficacy of human sacrifice for the archaic consciousness, before
attempting an interpretation of those myths. Still, I am convinced
that those myths can be understood only within the framework of
1 Sacred Books of the East, vol. 44, p. xvii. I have taken the liberty of modernizing the transcription of Old Indie words when they occur in the quotations.

studies on Indo-European human sacrifice. Reference to the Puru
sasiikta cannot be avoided, but a true comparativistic analysis must
remain in abeyance.

In Book 4 of Adam of Bremen’s History of the Archbishops of
Hamburg-Bremen, written in the eleventh century, there is a de¬
scription of the pagan temple and some religious pioceedings at
Uppsala, the last stronghold of heathendom in the North. Section 27
reads as follows in its entirety (with the exception of one medieval
annotation):2
For all their gods there are appointed priests to offer sacrifices for the people. If plague and famine threaten, a libation is poured to the idol Thor; if war, to Wotan; if marriages are to be celebrated, to Frikko. It is customary also to solemnize in Uppsala, at nine-year intervals, a general feast of all the provinces of Sweden. From attendance at this festival no one is exempted (a, [omitted scholion]). Kings and people all and singly send their gifts to Uppsala and, what is more distressing than any kind of punishment, those who have already adopted Christianity redeem them¬ selves through these ceremonies. The sacrifice is of this nature: of every living thing that is male, they offer nine heads (6, scholion 141 [137]: Feasts and sacrifices of this kind are solemnized for nine days. On each day they offer a man along with other living beings in such a number that in the course of the nine days they will have made offerings of seventytwo creatures. This sacrifice takes place about the time of the vernal equinox), with the blood of which it is customary to placate gods of this sort. The bodies they hang in the sacred grove that adjoins the temple. Now this grove is so sacred in the eyes of the heathen that each and every tree in it is believed divine because of the death and putrefaction of the victims. Even dogs and horses hang there with men. A Christian seventytwo years old told me that he had seen their bodies suspended promis¬ cuously. Furthermore, the incantations customarily chanted in the ritual of a sacrifice of this kind are manifold and unseemly; therefore it is better to keep silence about them.
Adam’s account is laconic, but in consideration of his last statement
we must be thankful to learn anything at all of the barbaric Norse
practices. The “manifold and unseemly” incantations are precisely
the variety of ritual knowledge we would be most fortunate to possess
for linguistic and religious historical purposes, but which we would
least expect to find preserved in a land overwhelmed by Christianity.
Still, Adam’s book does contain remarkably valuable and useful in¬
formation. A sdholion to the section preceding the one I quoted above

The Divine Victim 177
makes the additional remarkable observations:3 “Near this temple
stands a very large tree with wide-spreading branches, always green
winter and summer. What kind it is nobody knows. There is also a
spring at which pagans are accustomed to make their sacrifices, and
into it to plunge a live man. And if he is not found, the people’s wish
will be granted.”4 It would thus appear that drowning was also a
sacrificial technique at Uppsala. Notably, this scholion reveals the
existence of a huge tree and its evident cultic eminence. This tree is
beyond doubt the terrestrial, cultic counterpart of the world-ash
Yggdrasill that figures prominently in Norse mythological literature.
The cultic tree probably presided over those others in the grisly grove
where Adam’s Christian informant saw human bodies hanging. Per¬
haps we may suppose that distinguished victims were suspended from
the great tree.

The cult of the god Odin is known to have especially involved human
sacrifice during the Viking age. The literary reflections of Odin’s
mythology display a broad symbolic perspective in which human
sacrifice has found expression. Two literary motifis furnish minimally
the essential comparative materials. The first is the episode of King
Vikar in the Gautrekssaga,5 and the second is the enigmatic Runatals
pattr contained in the Havamal (138-145). A superficial survey of
these two sources suffices to disclose the salient symbols of human
sacrifice relevant to the Odin cult. An analysis of the symbolism re¬
veals the religious contextuality of Odinic human sacrifice. Here we
approach the comparativistic object of the present study—the role
of god as divine victim in ancient Scandinavia and India.
The tale of the death of King Vikar at Odin’s behest is recounted
in the Gautrekssaga and by Saxo in the Gesta Danorum.6 For the
purposes of this article the differences in the two versions are of no
consequence. The story recalls that King Vikar was to be made the
mock victim of a sacrifice to Odin and was to be hanged by means of
a fake noose. The god, however, insisted on the real victim, and,

ministering the coup de grace, pierced Vikar’s body with a spear. The
death imagery of the Gautrekssaga portrays Vikar hanged from a tree,
stabbed by Odin’s spear in Starkadr’s hand.
A common form (perhaps the predominant form) of human sacri¬
fice for Odin was by hanging from a tree or gibbet, accompanied
frequently by stabbing with a spear (Odin’s weapon) for good mea¬
sure. Many cases of hanging associated with Odin exist in the litera¬
ture. Saxo relates that the Odin-hero Hadingus ended his life by
hanging himself in public.7 Hanged men and men killed with a spear
belonged to Odin, who was actually a death god, or god of the dead,
although not a god of the netherworld. Truly, Odin’s Einherjar was
an army of dead men.
Stanzas 138-145 of the Havamal are uncannily difficult to interpret
with certainty in every respect and probably reflect Christian/pagan
syncretism in the poetic structure of their imagery; yet their content
does not plausibly derive from sources other than the pagan Odinic
tradition. The similarity of the hanging Odin with the crucified
Christ is obvious and well noted, but, as at least Van Hamel8 and
Turville-Petre9 have convincingly shown, every detail is thoroughly
consistent with pagan religiosity and the worship of Odin. The
Crucifixion can, of course, be studied in its Mediterranean setting as
a typological parallel to the divine sacrifices under scrutiny here, but
an analysis of the biblical event itself cannot further a comparative
study of Indie and Norse mythology in a way that might facilitate the
identification of maximally archaic and perhaps genetically related
features in the Indo-European mythological traditions. Internal an¬
alysis of the Germanic records has already proved sufficiently that
Havamal 138-145 is essentially pagan.
Considered within the framework of the sacrificial religious tradi¬
tion from which they spring, the relevant verses of the Havamal
constitute part of the answer to the question of the meaning of human
sacrifice to the pagan Norse mentality. In a wider scholarly context,
the immolation of the god Odin is a problem that must be stated and
clarified before late Norse paganism can be fully understood. This
essay seeks to prepare a statement of the problem and to indicate the
avenue toward its resolution. While risking the evils of an obscure
procedure, I allow the statement of the problem and its resolution
to appear in an implicit fashion. For this study, Havamal 138 is the
crucial locus for which India will supply the exegetic key. Stanzas

139 ff. record how Odin seized the runes and prospered. The god
himself narrates 138:
Veit ek at ek hekk vindga meiSi a naetr alia mu geiri undaSr ok gefinn 6Sni sjalfr sjalfum mer a teim meiSi er mangi veit, hvers hann af rotum renn.
Van Hamel offers a very persuasive interpretation of this Eddie
passage, without considering the problem of the more pervasive
meaning of Odin’s act to a pagan religious sensibility. Van Hamel
does not investigate the poetic mythological manifestation as part of
a consciousness which countenanced human sacrifice, nor does he
evaluate the god’s action with respect to the manner in which human
victims were consigned to him. Furthermore, he tried to demonstrate
that Odin’s deed in the Havamal amounted to an act of martyrdom
rather than sacrifice. I contest the distinction between martyrdom
and sacrifice as applied to a source like the Havamal, but I do admit
that many of Van Hamel’s criteria and explanations are interesting
for their own sake: for example, that martyrdom construes blind
powers, whereas sacrifice intends to win over the free will of a god.
The application of Van Hamel’s criteria to Odin and the Havamal
is deceptive, however, and fails to discover the most important con¬
tent of the episode in the poem.
Van Hamel has also discussed the semantic realm within which we
should consider gefinn as it occurs in the Havamal. Rather than ‘ge
opfert,’ it means ‘geweiht’ and was used in this sense when children
were dedicated to a god as living pledges. This is also the verb used in
the story of Vikar where a human victim (King Vikar) is consigned to
Odin: Starkadr: nu gef ek pik Odni, ‘now I give you to Odin.’ Still,
the question remains as to what meaning there is in the notion of a
god being consecrated to himself, as Odin is in Havamal 138. Van
Hamel thinks that there is meaning in such a statement as gefin sjalfr
sjalfum mer only if it is conceived as exemplary of what he considers
a pretheistic variety of Norse thinking, that of those Norsemen who
believed in their own strength only (a matt sinn ok megin). Supposed¬
ly these men would not be representative in their world view of an

atheistic perspective following the decline of the pagan religion, or
of any theistic viewpoint, but of the cultural stage prior to the de¬
velopment of the pagan religion! As Van Hamel puts it (op. cit., p.
265), “this mentality points to a social state anterior to that where
gods are worshipped.” How many contemporary historians of re¬
ligion would take that remark seriously? To me. Van Hamel’s primi¬
tivistic explanation seems incredible in every respect. Van Hamel
goes on to say that Odin’s ecstatic act generates his asmegin (‘divine
power’) to its acme. Somehow the god creates a force that cows the
runes and coerces them into his control. By means of a magical state
of sublimation, wherein he gives himself up to his own magical
essences, Odin conquers and captures the runes. In his comprehen¬
sion of the Odinic method, Van Hamel comes very close to an ade¬
quate realization of the content of the Runatals pattr.
While Van Hamel correctly understood Odin’s overt method, he
is, unfortunately, incorrect in believing that a secular, shamanistic
explanation of the hanging Odin will suffice, and that Odin’s actions
exemplify the orientation of men who belong to a pretheistic cultural
level. As we shall see, Odin’s behavior is eminently theistic in the
utmost degree and typologically resembles that of the Indie Prajapati
(lord of progeny), the prototype par excellence of the divine victim,
who suffers self-immolation within a reflexively creative and produc¬
tive ritual syndrome. The assertion that Odin is martyred, not sacri¬
ficed, pays no attention to the obvious and hardly inconsequential
fact that he suffers precisely the same ritual death as might befall one
of his human sacrificial victims. Odin does indeed die a ritual death
by means of which he appropriates the power of death, symbolized in
the runic magic that raises the dead to momentary eloquence. Van
Hamel’s criterion for sacrifice, cited above, could never apply to
Odin’s act or to Prajapati’s self-transformation and self-immolation
as exposited by the Indie Uttaramimamsd literature which is dis¬
cussed below. Odin is truly sacrificed to himself and not merely
martyred. Odin hung for nine nights on the world tree, which recalls
the nine-day festival at Uppsala referred to in Adam of Bremen’s
History. Odin was stabbed with a spear and hanged like his victim,
the unfortunate Vfkar (for instance), so that it seems obvious that the
god and the sacrificial victim were intentionally confounded in the
Havamdl. This realization induces us to seek the meaning of the
Norse hanging sacrifice in connection with a ritual repetition of the
self-willed immolation of the god. Especially considering that Odin
sought Vikar’s death, we should regard King Vfkar henceforth as
an Odin surrogate and the prototype of the human sacrificial offering
The Divine Victim 181
who fulfills the role of the supreme god in the capital sacrifice. The
parallels between Odin’s techniques in the Havamdl and the arts of
ancient and aboriginal sorcerers and magicians merely supply an¬
other avenue of research and do not compromise the study of the
hanging Odin as a self-immolated divine victim.
4
Van Hamel and others have correctly observed that the tree with
unknown roots upon which Odin hangs can be none other than the
world tree, the holy ash Yggdrasill. This tree is the sustainer of the
worlds and represents an organic axis mundi. Yggdrasill is the Norse
representative of the abundantly attested and remotely archaic “tree
of life” symbol. This symbol was taken seriously by many of the
ancients and was frequently an innermost constituent of ancient and
primitive religions. The primitive pancultural Eurasian cosmology
is unthinkable without the axis mundi, the tree of life, and the cos¬
mic center, all of which freely combine in the ancient conceptions.
Indo-European mythology is a pancultural Eurasian phenomenon,
and those studies that overlook the “tree of life,” or dismiss it as
marginal or incidental in importance, must fail to evaluate propeily,
or even approximately, many aspects of some Indo-European re¬
ligions and mythologies. The importance of the axis mundi in Ger¬
mania is well known and not easily overlooked; witness the Saxon
Irminsul and its historic role in the conversion of the most die-hard
continental Germanic pagans. The cosmic column could be con¬
ceived variously by the Germanic people as a tree or a simple stave,
without evident sense of contradiction. The manifestation of a uni¬
versal center shaft is prolific in all its forms in India as well. It was
natural and probably necessary, in terms of the religion of ancient
Scandinavia, that the poet of the Havamdl should portray Odin as
immolated on the world tree. Yggdrasill, of course, is the sacred tree
of the Aesir and, symmetrically, we have already observed in Adam of
Bremen’s account how the great temple of Uppsala had a terrestrial
replica of Yggdrasill. The practice of offering human victims on trees,
as at Uppsala, must have entailed the will to sacrifice at the symbolic
universal center in the presence of the cosmic sustainer. The close
association of human sacrifice and the axis mundi greatly facilitates
a comparativistic study. The symbolism of the world tree or axis
mundi usefully serves typology because it is so widespread among
variant traditions and so esoterically meaningful within the indivi¬
dual religions.

5Indie data relating to conceptions of the cosmic column and its sacrificial and mythological symbolism are abundant. But there are difficulties of taxonomy and interpretation caused by the mode of expression given to the world-tree symbol. In Vedic India we en¬ counter a language of symbolic forms of the highest sophistication, surpassed nowhere in world literature. Kuiper (IIJ 8:117 [1964]) correctly emphasizes that the Vedic passages that allude to the world tree or axis refer to an esoteric mystery. For that reason, naturalistic interpretations of the imagery of those passages misapprehend the symbol. Recent attempts have succeeded in taxonomically securing the identity of the tree and column symbol and have established the
world tree as paramount among Indie symbols.11 The great tree flourishes in various forms throughout Vedic and
later Indie literature; especially as the asvattha (Ficus religiosa) or pippala tree. The asvattha tree is a noteworthy feature of the Vedic texts and, as Linnaeus’ nomen indicates, it is religiously significant.
Its Old Indie name might mean ‘horse stead’ or ‘horse abode.’ The asvattha was honored in later times as the bodhi tree of Gautama Buddha. Another related though distinct tree often confused with
the asvattha is the nyagrodha or banyan tree (unmentioned by the Rig-Veda). The nyagrodha (Sanskrit nyagrodha, vata, bhandira, or
parkati, i.e., Ficus bengalensis or Ficus indica) is the bodhi tree of Kasyapa. The pippala (asvattha) and the nyagrodha are among the largest Indian trees and are often known as vanaspati (usually trans¬ lated ‘lord of the forest’), a name that is also applied to the fire-god
Agni.12 The tree of life is encountered in Indie literature and religion in various guises and is symbolically identifiable and partly cofunction¬ al with the universal column, even when the latter is not conceived as an organic tree, or when the tree has been transformed into a colossal stave as in the case of the skambha of Atharva-Veda 10.7 and 10.8 (and elsewhere).13 The skambha (‘supporter’),14 which is the sustainer of the universe, is portrayed by the author of Atharva-Veda 10.7.20

21 as fashioned from the trunk of a tree in a way comparable with the formation of the Irminsul of the Saxons. But the same hymn also characterizes the skambha as still possessing branches, so that we
must accept the sustainer as symbolically heteromorphic.
6.
The symbolism of the world axis as the sacrificial center provides a comparativistic point of orientation. In Indie sacrificial texts the
yupa or stake, to which the creature to be immolated is bound, can be a specially selected tree still in the forest, which is prepared for use in the ritual. The cosmic axis that, as explained above, can be visualized as a leafy, growing tree or as a simple shaft, is symbolized in the yupa. In the Rig-Veda, the Apri hymns, which are ritually connected with animal sacrifices, refer to or address the yupa as vanaspati. It is quite clear that the Rig-Veda comprehends the yupa as vanaspati.15 The vanaspati,18 as explained above in section 5, is
itself the asvattha, or terrestrial avatar of the cosmic tree. The yupa, as the symbol of the cosmic axis, is the necessary locus of the human and animal sacrifice and is simultaneously an alternative form of the
tree of life. The comparison of the employment of the yupa in the Indie sacri¬
fices with the similar function of the tree or gibbet in Ancient Scan¬ dinavia discloses concordances between the Indie and Norse prac¬ tices. In India, the pasu or sacrificial animal (pasu was also applied to the human victim) was tied to the yupa by a cord or rope and strangled to death if the blood sacrifice was actually performed fully. The strangulation death in India and the hanging death of the Odin victim resemble each other. Variant means of sacrificial killing were
also in use.17
is H. Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, vol. 46, p. 12. Oldenberg is not alone in his perception of the yupa as vanaspati. 1® The name vanaspati is applied both to the asvattha and to Agni, who is also otherwise associated with the asvattha. it Unfortunately, I must leave out of this paper the pressing discussion of Varuna and his noose as related to human sacrifice. In a religious-historical study in depth, as opposed to typological groundwork, Varuna versus Odin would be¬ come important immediately. Eggeling, too, emphasized the importance of Varuna (Sacred Books of the East, vol. 44, p. xx): "Of any connection of the sacri¬ ficial horse with Prajapati, on the other hand, as of the Prajapati theory of the sacrifice generally, clearly shadowed forth in the Purusa-sukta, and so decidedly dominant during the Brahmana period, no trace is to be found in the earlier hymns. Indeed, if we have any right to assume that the horse-sacrifice was known and practised in the earlier times, it can scarcely be doubted that King Varuna must have been the deity to whom this victim was chiefly consecrated.”

I offer here a brief overview of the purusamedha literature in ancient India and a review of some of the most noteworthy aspects of the rite. The ritual of the human sacrifice is briefly described in the thirteenth kanda of the Satapatha Brahmana (White Yajur-Veda), and a list of the special victims is supplied by Vajasaneyi Samhita 30.5—22 (White Yajur-Veda). The sacrifice is not mentioned in the Taittiriya Samhita (nor evidently in the Maitrayani or Kdthaka Samhita s), but a slightly differing list of victims is given in the Taittiriya Brahmana. The rit¬ ual of the purusamedha is detailed as well in five of the Srautasutra’s, viz. those of Sahkhayana (to the Rig-Veda), Apastamba and Hiranyakesin (both to the Taittiriya Samhita), Katyayana (to the White Yajur-Veda), and Vaitana (to the Atharva-Veda). Of these, however, only the Sahkhayana and Vaitana Srautasutra’s actually prescribe the real killing of the human pasu. The others have the human victim re¬ leased at the last moment, or have an animal put to death in his place, under the ritual pretense that the animal is a man.
The purusamedha is a pahcaratra (‘five-night’) sacrifice which ac¬ cording to Katyayana (21.1.2) is to be initiated only by a member of the brahmana or rajanya castes. According to Sahkhayana (who pre¬ scribes real killing) it achieves everything that is not yet attained by the potent a'svamedha. In many particulars the purusamedha rite duplicates the ritual of the horse sacrifice. Whereas in the latter a horse, gomrga, and aja tupara form the nucleus of the assemblage of victims consecrated en masse to Prajapati, in the human sacrifice a man occupies the place of the horse. Sahkhayana says that the puru$apasu is supposed to be a brahmin or kshatriya who has been pur¬ chased for the price of a hundred horses and a thousand cows. Like the horse in the a’svamedha, the human victim is permitted to go unfettered for a year preceding his sacrificial death, under the pro¬ vision that he remain sexually chaste during that year of freedom. Prajapati himself is sometimes called the year, and the Brhadaran
yakopanisad (1.2.4) states that when Prajapati became the sacrificial horse who was to prepare for his voluntary immolation, he contained his semen for a length of time equivalent to a year. Upon its release, the semen became the year (samvatsaram), which, we are told, had not yet existed.
The number of victims offered at a single performance of the purusamedha could be large (according to Satapatha Brahmana, 166 persons on eleven yupas). The lists of potential and ritually desirable victims given by the Satapatha Brahmana, the Taittiriya Brahmana,
The Divine Victim 185
and the Vajasaneyi Samhita are interesting because of the bizarre and peculiarly detailed personal and physiognomic requirements to
which each of the victims must individually conform. The performance of the purusamedha entailed recitation of the “Purusa-Narayana” hymn, Rig-Veda 10.90. This cosmogonic sukta
narrates the primordial, prototypical sacrifice of a special man (puru.ya) conceived as a divine being. The Brahma Purana (adhyaya 161)18 gives a commentary to the Purusasukta. The passage provides an inkling of how the Puruyasukta was understood in antiquity and so might contribute to a realization of the meaning of the immolation
of the divine victim. A notable feature of the Puranic story is the identification of the yupa with kola (‘time’). The world tree itself can be found associated with temporal symbolism. The passage also exploits an ambiguity in the meaning of the word guna, employing it in a context that recalls the primary meaning of ‘bond’ or ‘cord’ simultaneously with the derived meaning ‘quality.’ The contextual implication is that the three guna’s bind the puruya to the sacrificial
post (yupa) of time (kala). The passage says that Brahman had pre¬ pared for a cosmogonic sacrifice in which kala would be the yupa, and the three guna’s would be the bonds for tying the victim, but no
pasu was available (161.39: . . . naiva tatrabhavat pasuh). Brahman says forlornly (161.40): Vinaiva pasuna nayam yajhah parisamap
yate, ‘without a victim this sacrifice cannot be instituted.’ There fol¬ lows a dialogue between Brahman and the bodiless goddess of speech (akasavag asaririni) within (nitya) Brahman, which results in a
puruya sacrifice.19
8.
The purusamedha, like the a’svamedha, bears a singular relationship
to Prajapati, the lord of progeny, frequently called “father” by the Satapatha Brahmana. The Uttaramimamsa texts declare that it is Prajapati himself who is sacrificed in the form of a horse, as an entity undergoing immolation and himself immolating. Thus, the opening sections of the Madhukandam, at the very beginning of the Brhadaranyakopanisad, unroll the fantastic and awesome symbolism of the a'svamedha and define how the symbols extoll Prajapati’s cosmogonic self-slaughter. The god and the victim are unequivocally identified.

The limitless labyrinths of the Brahmana’s enfold yet another transi¬ tion of role and identity beyond the synthesis of god and victim. The role and power of Prajapati are bequeathed to the patron of the sacri¬ fice whenever he initiates it. So, as L. Renou writes:20 “The human sacrifice is the most efficacious of all: it makes the sacrificer equal to Prajapati, the great victim.” The Satapatha Brahmana clearly sup¬ ports this portrayal of the patron’s relation to the process of the sacrifice. Eggeling, in the introduction to his translation, has made some definitive paraphrases which, by virtue of their insight and clarity, are worth quoting at length:21
Prajapati, who here takes the place of the purusa, the world-man, or allembracing personality, is offered up anew in every sacrifice: and inasmuch as the very dismemberment of the Lord of Creatures, which took place at that archetypal sacrifice, was in itself the creation of the universe, so every sacrifice is also a repetition of that first creative act. . . . The theo¬ logians of the Brahmanas go, however, an important step further by identifying the performer, or patron, of the sacrifice—the Sacrificer, with Prajapati—. ... As regards the symbolic connection of the Sacrificer him¬ self with the sacrifice, there can at any rate be no doubt that it was an essential and an intimate one from the very beginning of the sacrificial practice.
In other words, such a connection is essential to Vedic religion, since this religion was fundamentally sacrificial. This comprehension of
the role of the sacrificer has the utmost importance for an adequate understanding of archaic Inclic religion and of those religions that are comparable with it. The point of view Eggeling represents is abundantly supported in the testimony of the Purvamimamsa and Uttaramimamsa texts themselves. This viewpoint and the perspec¬ tives disclosed by its implementation in an analysis of human sacri¬ fice can provide the clue to the real and pervasive meaning of the ut¬ terance of the self-immolated Norse magical deity: gefinn 6dni, sjalfr
sjalfum mer, ‘given to Odin, myself to myself.’

Typologically, the Indie yupa (i.e., vanaspati, asvattha, and so on) is categorially equivalent to the sacrificial trees at pagan Uppsala, and,
20 Vedic India (Calcutta, 1957), p. 96. 21 Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, vol. 43, pp. xv-xvi. H. Oldenberg ("Der geopferte Gott und das Agnicayana," Nachrichten von der Kgl. Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zur,Gottingen, Phil.-hist. Kl. 1917 [1918], pp. 6-8) disagreed with Eggeling’s conception of Prajapati (purusa) as victim, but Oldenberg’s objection is not well made because he denied Prajapati’s victimhood principally on the grounds that it did not fit into the Frazerian symptomatic paradigm of the dying god. His text-critical objection adduced in a footnote is unconvincing.
The Divine Victim 187
seen through the mythopoetic prism of the Havamal, to Yggdrasill in its role as the hanging Odin’s gibbet. The word used in Havamal 138 which is usually rendered as ‘tree’ is Old Icelandic meidr. F. Strom22 argues that the word meidr means ‘pole, gallows,’ rather than tree,
although he evidently accepts the translation as ‘tree’ in the Havamal. Apparently the term was often used in poetry with the meaning ‘tree.’ The semantic parallelism of yupa and meidr is quite close. The symbolic perception of both Havamal 138 and the Vedic Apri hymns which contain the word vanaspati deepens and expands prismatically when we consider that the vanaspati, in the capacity of a yupa in the blood sacrifices of the Vedic Arya, resembles the role of
trees in the Uppsala cult. As mentioned in the foregoing sections, the horse sacrifice and the human sacrifice are interrelated. Adam of Bremen’s Christian infor¬
mant asserted that at Uppsala horses and dogs could be seen hanging on trees next to men. The relationship of the horse to the world tree is itself an important subject, especially in the religions and mytholo¬ gies of the Indo-European area. Again, in connection with the prac¬ tice and mythology of human sacrifice and the divine victim, the horse and its association with the world tree is curious. As we saw above, one of the Indie names for the celestial tree, asvattha, is prob¬ ably equine in content. The asvattha, however, is also involved with the hieratic fire god Agni23 and, as mentioned before, shares with him and the nyagrodha tree the name vanaspati, which is also the Rig
Vedic appellation for the personified yupa. The intimate rapport be¬ tween Agni and the tree is episodically expressed by the Satapatha
Brahmana in the myth of Pururavas and Urvasi, but the Taittiriya
Brahmana (1.1.3.9, quoted by Sayana in his commentary on Rig-Veda 1.65, which tells of Agni’s flight into the waters) astonishingly enunci¬ ates the heteromorphic and congruent characters of Agni, the horse,
and the asvattha tree combined: agnir devebhyo nildyata asvo rupam krtva so ‘svatthe samvatsaram at isthat, ‘Agni hid from the gods. Hav¬ ing made [himself into] the form of a horse, he abode in the asvattha [tree] for a year (samvatsaram)V This is an amazing confluence of identities and events, but Rig-Veda 10.27.14a almost surpasses the Taittiriya Brahmana with the bewildering image of a large, shad¬
owless, leafless horse: brhann acchdyo apalaso arva tasthaii mata visito atti gdrbhah, which Geldner renders, ‘ein holier, schattenloser,
unbelaubter [Baum], ein Renner [ist er]-die Mutter steht still, ent

bunden frisst das Kind. . . Murray Fowler24 has done the service of calling attention to this startling Vedic image, while trying, by comparativistic means, to reclaim some of the scorched earth left by pioneers like Ludwig, who translated the opening line: ‘hoch, schattenlos, laublos, beweglich ist der himmel.’ This scholar tried to make his bland translation palatable by adding the acrimonious comment: “unrichtig muss arva sein, da ein vernunftiger mensch doch wohl von
einem laublosem ross nicht sprechen kann.” I, for one, find Ludwig’s leafless sky unrichtig and his point of view absurd.
Fowler correctly identifies the image in the first line of Rig-Veda 10.27.14 as a hippodendron and believes like Grassman that its ulti¬ mate referent is Agni of the asvattha. Agni’s heteromorphology asso¬ ciates him with the asvattha, but for reasons that differ substantially from the one adduced by Fowler, who evidently believed in the suffi¬ ciency of the naturalistic explanation that fire (Agni) is felt to be inert and latent in wood (asvattha tree).
The comparison of the asvattha with Yggdrasill is natural and ele¬ mentary. Yggdrasill, too, is a hippodendron. As has been well known since Sophus Bugge, drasill is an Old Icelandic poetic word for horse, while Yggr (‘the terrible’) is a name of Odin, as evidenced by Grimnismdl 54:
DSinn ek mi heiti Yggr ek aSan h£t.
Odin am I now called, Yggr was I called before.
Most scholars have wanted to construe Yggdrasill as meaning ‘Ygg’s [Odin’s] horse,’ with the meaning extended to ‘Odin’s gallows’ and into the Norse semantic realm wherein ‘horse’ equals ‘gallows’ and doubles as a potent death symbol. Two facts oppose the unqualified acceptability of this definition. First, the tree is alternatively called Yggdrasills askr (‘Yggdrasill’s ash-tree’), as though Yggdrasill itself were another name for the god Odin. Second, everyone25 notices that for the meaning ‘Ygg’s horse’ we should expect the form of the word to be *Yggsdrasill, which has not been found. There is a theoretically possible solution if, as I suggest, we interpret the compound as endocentric in meaning and signifying ‘Ygg, the horse.’ Seen in this way, however, not only is Yggdrasill (that is, Yggdrasills askr) a hippoden¬
dron, but Odin^himself is unmasked in a hippomorphic Gestalt like <
24 jaos 67:273 (1947). 25 E.g., Jan de Vries, Altnordisch.es etymologisches Worterbuch (Leiden, 1942), pp. 676-677.
The Divine Victim 189
the one assumed by both Prajapati and Agni, and, heteromorphically,
Odin assumes the form of a hippodendron as well! His case would be analogous to that of Agni according to Taittiriya Brdhmana 1.1.3.9. In my opinion, these considerations and possibilities seem theoreti¬ cally quite likely and plausible. The heteromorphic propensities of
the Indo-European gods are already well recognized.
10.
The time has come to survey the more general implications of this study and to define the common motivation that seems to underly those portions of the Indie and ancient Scandinavian sacrificial tra¬ ditions that involved and employed human sacrifice after a divine
example. Prajapati is not the only Indie divine victim, but at least in his hippomorphic manifestation in the asvamedha he offers the best
prototypical example for a typology. His identification with the purusa is at hand but is less explicit, probably because of the flagging metaphysical support for human sacrifice within the ancient Indie religious orthodoxy. Seeking the motivation for the kind of human sacrifice studied here, we need not search endlessly through the laby¬ rinthine brahmanical texts, even if we could not already intuit or deduce the driving will to appropriate divine, cosmic power by means of a ritual, karmic quasi-science. The Satapatha Brdhmana and the Brhaddranyakopani.yad (originally a part of the total text of
the former) fulfill their ancient function of exegesis, explaining clear¬ ly enough the import of the sacrifice. At the beginning of the purufamedha ritual the Satapatha Brdhmana declares (13.6.1, after Eggeling): “Purusa Narayana desired, ‘Would that I overpassed all beings! would that I alone were everything here [this universe]! He beheld this five-days sacrificial performance, the Purusamedha, and took it, and performed offering therewith; and having performed
offering therewith, he overpassed all beings, and became everything here. And, verily, he who, knowing this, performs the Purusamedha, or who even knows this, overpasses all beings, and becomes every¬ thing here.” For an Indie text, the above could not be more straight¬ forward. In our terms, an ontological issue is at stake. If the yajamana, the sacrificial patron, cannot be god, then at least by means of the brahmanical magical “science” he can appropriate divine power and surmount existential heights rivaling the stations of the gods whenever he performs the sacrifice modeled after the ultimate godly
act, the self-sacrifice that unleashes total power. The concept of ap¬ propriation at the sacrifice obviously motivates the yuparohana, the



igo James L. Sauve
mounting of the sacrificial post erected at the symbolic center of all existence, whereby the yajamana thirsts to acquire the being and energy of the absolute center, the symbolic cosmic axis. The extent of the sacrificial victory in ontological terms is most spectacularly expressed by Brhadaranyakopani$ad 1.2.7:28 He27 desired:
“Would that this [body] of mine were fit for sacrifice! Would that by it I had a self (atmanviri)\” Thereupon it became a horse (asva), because it swelled (asvat). “It has become fit for sacrifice (medhya)\” thought he. Therefore the horse sacrifice is called Asva-medha. He, verily, knows the Asva-medha, who knows it thus. He kept him [i.e., the horse] in mind without confining him. After a year he sacrificed him for himself. [Other] animals he delivered over to the divinities. Therefore men sacrifice the victim which is consecrated to Prajapati as though offered unto all the gods. Verily, that [sun] which gives forth heat is the Asva-medha. The year is its embodiment (atman). This [earthly] fire is the arka. The worlds are its embodiments. These are two, the arka sacrificial fire and the Asva-medha sacrifice. Yet again they are one divinity, even Death. He [who knows this] wards off repeated death (punarmrtyu), death obtains him not, death becomes his body (atman), he becomes one of these deities.
The Upanishadic identity of the horse sacrifice with death parallels the Norse perception of the horse as death symbol. Human sacrifice conforming to the example of the lugubrious Odin envisages the attainment of a goal similar to that of the Brahmanic practice. Odin achieved a mighty victory over death when he dangled from the world tree for nine nights, and secured possession of the powerful runes, effective over the dead, thus attaining a dual ontological supremacy over the realms of the living and the dead. As in the case of Prajapati, immortality as it applies to Odin can be prop¬ erly understood only as a litotes formula for the expression of super¬ abundant life that encompasses and assimilates even death and can never be compatible with the Platonic terms of Judeo-Christian the¬ ology. Odin’s ontological mastery of two realms was, however, a momentary and designed transcendence of an immutable and basic dualism in the Norse religious tradition. At the Ragnarok Odin’s magical cosmic grip would loosen and the inimical forces would dis¬ lodge him.
Whatever the contrast between the Vedic and Viking traditions, in
the goals of human sacrifice they appear to maintain consonance. The

ultimate divine act of self-sacrifice was perceived as the eschatological mystery wherein the last possible cosmic potentiality was actualized in the person of the sacrificer. The religious institution of human sacrifice pursued the model of the godly archetype as the supieme sacrificial mystery which mobilized the maximum possible magical
propensities of the offering.



The Separate Functions of the Indo-European Divine Twins
DONALD J. WARD, University of California, Los AngeJes
Although the new comparative Indo-European mythology owes its existence almost exclusively to Georges Dumezil, some of the most brilliant studies to emerge from the new discipline have come not from Dumezil but from the Swedish scholar Stig Wikander. In 1947 Wikander made a highly significant contribution when he was able to show conclusively that much of the great Indian epic, the Mahabharata, represented euhemerized Indo-Iranian mythology.1 With this one article, the entire study of Indo-European mythology and the theories of Georges Dumezil acquired new stature, for Wikander, working within the framework of Dumd'zil’s system, was able to pro¬ duce startling and convincing results. In a more recent investigation2 Wikander was able to uncover the first totally convincing evidence of Indo-European mythology among Germanic-speaking peoples, and the implications of this study are just making themselves felt among historians, mythologists, and philologists.3 But of all of Wikander’s studies, none is more remarkable than the one in which he again turned to the euhemerized mythology of the Mahabharata and investigated the twin heroes, Nakula and Sahadeva,4 the twin

sons of the Vedic divinities, the Asvins. Wikander was able to show that each member of the heroic pair had a quite distinct personality, and that each played a distinct role in the epic. Nakula, the heroic, handsome warrior, is a breaker and trainer of horses. He is also re¬ ported to have “eyes of fire’’ and “the shoulders of a lion.” Sahadeva, on the other hand, is of a sweet, peaceful temperament and is as¬ sociated with domestic duties and with the care of cattle. He is con¬ sidered to be especially virtuous, modest, patient, intelligent, and
just. Wikander points out that the one twin, in his role as warrior, rep¬ resents Dumezil’s second function, while his brother, interested in domestic duties and animal husbandry, represents the third func¬
tion.5 This association of each twin with a separate function was, ac¬ cording to Wikander, already well defined during the period of Indo-European unity. This hypothesis, however, encounters diffi¬ culty, for in the Rig-Veda the Asvins are characterized and invoked as equals. Wikander has carefully analyzed the Vedic hymns and has discovered a number of subtle differences between the brothers which are all variants of a sharp, fundamental distinction. For ex¬
ample, the identical traits and functions (fertility and warfare) as¬ sociated with the heroes Nakula and Sahadeva are also characteristic of the Asvins and are furthermore reflected in their epithets. These epithets, although generally applied to both divinities, invariably occur in pairs, and in nearly always the same order. This recurring order, which is parallel to the order of epithets used individually for Nakula and Sahadeva, is a strong indication that originally one set of epithets belonged to the one Asvin, and the other set belonged to the second Asvin. Moreover, the post-Vedic texts call the one twin Nasatya and the other Dasra, both forms being in the singular.6
Wikander supports his conclusions with evidence found in the Iran¬
5 The Indo-European tripartite structure, which, according to Dum£zil, is re¬ flected not only in the mythology, but in society as a whole, makes a clear distinc¬ tion between the functions of the divinities. The first function is essentially the religio-political function involving the priests and the kings (Mitra-Varuna). The second function is that of warfare, involving warriors (Indra). The third func¬ tion is essentially economic, involving fertility, wealth, and general well-being (ASvins). 6 Although in the Rig-Veda both names generally occur in the dual, there is one hymn (4.3.6) which speaks of one Nasatya. Other scholars have also concluded that these were originally the individual names of the ASvins. See P. S. Sastri, “The Semantic History qf the Words Nasatyau and Dasrau,” Journal of Oriental Re¬ search (Madras) 171232 (1946). Similarly P. Collinet (“Vedic Chips,” Babylonian and Oriental Record 3:196 [1888-1889]) contends that Nasatya was originally a singular that became a dual and was then applied to both twins much like the Roman "Castores.”

ian Avesta, in which there is only the figure of a demon named Naqhaithya (Videvdat 10.9, 19.43). This name corresponds to the Vedic Nasatya, a favorite epithet of the Asvins. The Avesta treats this figute as malevolent, thereby revealing an instance of Zoroastrian damning of an Aryan divinity. As Wikander has shown,7 all divinities associ¬ ated with warfare and with the horse were rejected by the Zoroastrian religion. Consequently the one Asvin, who exhibited the more wai
like nature, and who was associated with the horse, was demoted to the role of a demon in the new religion. The second twin, the peace¬ ful youth, who was concerned with more domestic chores and with the cow, should have found ready acceptance in the Zoroastrian pantheon. Wikander believes to have found him in the figure of Atar, son of Ahura Mazdah. Although this final point is not as convincing as the remainder of the brilliant study, Wikander has nonetheless shown conclusively that the Vedic Asvins originally had distinct char¬
acteristics and functions, and that from the beginning the one twin was associated with the second function and the other twin with the
third function.8 The implication of Wikander’s study is, of course, that this dis¬
tinction of the Indo-Iranian twin gods dates back to the period of Indo-European unity and was evident in the original stiatum of Indo-European mythology. Such a conclusion, however, should not be reached too hastily. The concept of twin divinities having totally distinct characteristics and functions is by no means limited to IndoEuropean mythology but is worldwide in distribution. This univer¬
sal concept has arisen logically from the widespread notion that a multiple birth is the result of multiple conception.9 As the result of this belief, one frequently encounters the notion that a pair of twins cannot possibly be sired by a single father. The attitudes recorded in some of the legends collected by the Brothers Grimm attest that this
7 "Nakula et Sahadeva,” p. 81. . , . 8 Ibid., pp. 82-83. Various scholars have sensed the essential difference between the ASvins, even though the evidence indicating such distinction is subtle. For ex¬ ample, C. Renel IL’evolution d'un mythe: Agvins et Dioscures [Paris, 1896], p. 63) sees the one twin embodying the fire element o£ the sacrifice, whereas the second embodies the liquid element. F. Cornelius (Indogermanische Rehgionsgeschichte TMunich, 1042], p. 65) contends that the one twin was the coachman and the second the warrior in the celestial chariot, G. L. Chandavarkar ("Asvins as His¬ torical Figures,” Journal of the University of Bombay 3:81 [1935]), contends that the ASvins owe their existence to a single mortal who became deified and thus led a twofold existence, human and divine. Thus the concept of two ASvins, one divine
and one mortal, is supposed to have developed. 9 For examples from various ethnographic sources, see L. Sternberg, Der antike Zwillingskult im Lichte der Ethnologie,” ZEthn 61:167-69 (1929). See also A. H. Krappe, Mythologie universelle (Paris, 1930), p. 65.

belief was still current in Europe in relatively modern times. For ex¬ ample, legend number 521: “Es ist unmoglich, daB dieses Weib drei Kinder von einem Mann haben konne ohne Ehebruch.”10 Similarly, legend number 584: “Es ist unmoglich, daB ein Weib zwei Kinder auf einmal von einem Vater habe.”11
Notions of the dual paternity of human twins have played a role in the formation of mythological traditions involving divine twins as they occur throughout the world. A typical example is provided by
the mythology of the Apapocuva Indians of south Brazil. The pan¬ theon of this tribe includes a pair of divine twins, one of whom is the son of a high deity, “Our Great Father,” while the second twin is considered the son of a lesser divinity, “Our Father Knower of All Things.”12
Since twin deities are frequently considered to have been begotten by different fathers, the twins often are very different in nature. For example, in the Old Testament Esau is the bold, vigorous huntsman,
while his brother Jacob is a docile shepherd. Among the Brazilian Apapocuva, the elder of the twin deities is a powerful god who re¬ sides in heaven; the younger brother, on the other hand, is of minor importance and resides in the east with his mother. Generally throughout the Americas the elder of twin deities is clever and capable, while the younger is a foolish, lazy blockhead.13
Among the mythological traditions of Indo-European peoples, various pairs of Greek divine twins were reported to have been be¬ gotten by separate fathers. According to Pindar (Nemean Odes, 10.150), Polydeukes was begotten by Zeus, while Kastor was fathered by Tyndareos.14 Similarly, the twin Amphion (musician) was fathered by Zeus, whereas Zethos (huntsman) was fathered by the mortal Epopeus. Moreover, Zeus begot Herakles, whereas the mortal Amphit¬ ryon begot his twin brother, Iphikles.
A parallel to the Greek tradition is encountered in Vedic religion. The twin Asvins, like the Dioscuri, are both called Divo napata, ‘Sons of God’15 (Rig-Veda 1.117.12), yet they are likewise reported to
1° Briider Grimm, Deutsche Sagen (Berlin, 1956), p. 493. 11 Ibid., p. 584. The identical notion is found in lines 38-42 of the twelfthcentury poem of Marie de France, Le Frene. 12 See A. E. Jensen, Mythos und Kult bei Naturvolkern (Wiesbaden, 1951), p. 34i13 A. Metraux, “Twin Heroes in South American Mythology,” JAF 59:114 (1946). 14 See also Pausarrias 4.31.7, 3.26.2; Apollodorus 3.10.5. 15 The identical name is preserved in Baltic mythology where the twins are called Dieva deli in Latvian, and Dievo suneliai in Lithuanian, both of which mean ‘Sons of God.’ Moreover, the Greek Aids novpoi has the identical meaning. All three forms are not only related in meaning but etymologically as well.

have had different fathers. One of the twins is the “blessed offspring of the sky,” while the other is the son of the mortal Sumakha (RigVeda 1.181.4).
In view of this evidence, the distinction in the function and char¬ acter of the Vedic twins as worked out by Wikander is in no way sur¬
prising. If, as in the case of Dioscuric traditions the world over, the twins were considered the products of two different fathers, the dis¬ tinction in their behavior and in their religious function is only to be expected. Since this phenomenon is universal, one could justifia¬ bly question the contention that the divergences between the Asvins represent an exclusively Indo-European trait.16 In the case of the Indo-Iranian tradition, however, we do not merely have a distinction between the twin deities, we have a highly specialized difference, that is, one twin is associated with warfare, horses, and strength, and the other is associated with domestic duties, cattle, fertility, and is a gentle being. We thus have a uniquely Indo-European manifestation of a universal Dioscuric trait.17 For, although distinctions between twin divinities are encountered everywhere, the specific one found in
the Indo-Iranian tradition is by no means worldwide in its distri¬ bution.
Wikander’s contention that this distinction between the IndoIranian divinities belongs to the original stratum of Indo-European mythology, as well as the entire tripartite theory of Dum^zil, would gain in strength if one could find evidence of such a differentiation among the other Indo-European Dioscuric pairs. I believe that it can indeed be detected, although, as in the case of the Rig-Veda, it is not always immediately discernible. Before discussing the details, however, I should like to adduce evidence that shows that various Indo-European Dioscuric pairs were, in general, associated with the “second and third functions.”
That the Vedic twins were associated with both the warrior and fertility function is well known. Regarding the second function they help Vispala in contest (.Rig-Veda 1.112.10), they protect mortals in combat (10.143.4), they grant victory in war (8.35.12). Similarly, the Greek Dioscuri are renowned for their role as warriors. They bat
16 Similarly, the evidence of a distinction between other Indo-European Di¬ oscuric pairs, e.g., Kastor was mortal, Polydeukes divine, Kastor was the “breaker of horses,” Polydeukes a boxer (Iliad 3.326; Odyssey 11.298), cannot in itself be considered as belonging exclusively to the Indo-European tradition. 17 For a discussion of uniquely Indo-European traits of “Dioscurism” occurring within the framework of a universal “Dioscurism,” see R. Goossens, "Notes de mythologie comparee indo-europeenne,” NClio 1/2:13-14 (1949-1950). See also D. Waid, The Divine Twins: An Indo-European Myth in Germanic Tradition, Folklore Studies, 19 (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1968), pp. 8-29.

tie with Idas and Lynkeus over cattle. They lead the storming o the fortress at Aphidnae to liberate their sister.18 Even the Latvian Sons of God were reported to have been equipped with a sword. The third function is also associated with the various twin divini¬
ties. Many Vedic hymns invoking the Asvins praise their ability to
promote fertility. They are praised for placing the germ in all female creatures (1.157.5), and for giving fertility to the bride (10 184.2). They give a child to the wife of the eunuch (1.117.24) and milk to the barren cow (1.112.3). Evidence of the Dioscuri functioning as di¬
vinities of fertility is relatively scant. They were frequently honored at important festivals and banquets where offerings of food were made to them,20 indicating that they may have been divinities of the harvest. There are, moreover, countless reliefs and coins that depict the twins with a horn of plenty, sheaves of grain, and other agricu tural products.21 Furthermore, the eggshell hats (piloi) of the twins were evidently fertility symbols. Moreover, the Roman Castor was associated with the goddess of fountains, Juturna, indicating that he
was worshiped as a fertility deity.22 Similarly, in the mythology of the Baltic region, the twin Sons of God were envisioned working with
agricultural implements, helping to till the soil and sow the seeds,
thus indicating that they functioned as divinities of the harvest an of fertility. One Latvian song, for example, reports that the twin gods had plows of gold and seeds of silver.23 Moreover, they bring the yeast and add it to the beer,24 and they are associated with the “golden
dew” that covers the green meadows.25 The evidence above makes it clear that in the various IncoEuropean traditions, the Divine Twins were associated with both the second and third functions. The evidence that each twin was originally associated with only one of these functions is more difficult
to uncover. . In Greek mythology this contrast is stressed when Pindar (Pythian

Odes 5.9) uses the epithet xpv<ra-PPaT°h ‘in a golden chariot,’ to refer to Kastor alone. Moreover, Kastor was honored as the founder of the horse race, while Polydeukes was honored for having invented the hound races. The dog is clearly an animal associated with house and farm, whereas the horse, especially in ancient Greek civilization, is
an animal of warfare. An even more remarkable contrast is made
in Homeric Hymn 33.3, which calls Kastor imroSa/uos, ‘breaker of
horses,’ and mentions ajudi/ujroi' JloXvSevKea, ‘the faultless [virtuous] Polydeukes.’ It is in the Roman sources, however, that this funda¬ mental distinction is most clearly expressed. In a recent study, R. Schilling has demonstrated that the Roman knights, whose cavalry
charge at Lake Regillus in 499 b.c. saved the Roman infantry from a rout, had already worshiped Castor as a patron of their class.26 The reason that one brother alone was worshiped, instead of both Dios¬ curi, is evidently that Kastor alone was the warlike youth, associated with the horse. His docile, virtuous brother would have been poorly suited for the needs of an elite knighthood. Further evidence of this
contrast occurs in Dio Cassius (57.14.9), who reports that the younger Drusus was “so prone to anger that he even inflicted blows upon a distinguished knight and received on this account the nickname
Castor.”27 This report indicates that the Romans evidently carried the contrast between the Dioscuri to an extreme. Not only was Castor considered warlike and aggressive, but rash and hot-tempered as well. Pollux, who was unquestionably a more passive figure, and who was more involved with domestic functions, gradually faded
into the background. Although there is evidence of Germanic peoples having worshiped the Divine Twins,28 the source material is generally too scant to enable the scholar to discern a difference between the Germanic di¬
vinities.29 A possible exception is furnished by Hengist and Horsa, who were reported to have led the Anglo-Saxon invasions of the British Isles.30 The names of the brothers mean ‘stallion’ and ‘horse,’
26 Op. cit. 27 K. Scott, "Drusus, Nicknamed ‘Castor,’” CPh 25:155 (1930). 28 See Ward, op. cit., also “Kudrun: An Indo-European Mythological Theme?” Indo-European and Indo-Europeans (Philadelphia, 1970). 29 If one accepts Dumezil’s hypothesis that the gods Freyr and Njordr repre¬ sent the Germanic twins (La Saga de Hadingus [Paris, 1953], pp. 118-159), one could build a strong case for each of these divinities representing a separate function. Dumezil, however, does not offer enough evidence to prove his con¬ tention. so During the migrations various Germanic peoples were reported to have been under the leadership of such pairs, for example the leaders of the Vandals were



respectively, indicating that the same theriomorphic concept asso¬ ciated with other divine pairs of the Indo-European tradition was known also among Germanic peoples. Of particular interest regarding these sources is that the one brother, Horsa, gradually disappears from the scene leaving Hengist as the sole leader of the invaders. We are already familiar with the gradual disappearance of one member of a Dioscunc pair, namely in the Roman sources in which the passive, docile Pollux is over¬ shadowed by his more aggressive, warlike brother. One can speculate that a similar distinction was responsible for the demise of Horsa during the heroic age. As an aggressive heroic warrior Hengist was doubtless praised in lay and legend. His more docile brother, as a representative of the third function who may have been a pation of herdsmen and farmers, was excluded from the heroic songs, and thus his name is often missing from those records that tell of the
exploits of Anglo-Saxon heroes. One can further speculate that in Germanic religion there de¬ veloped a dual aspect of the sacred horse. The one aspect may have represented the horse as an animal of warfare, and the other as an animal of the farm and of fertility. Similar to the Indo-European tradition in which the one twin divinity was associated with the horse and the other with the cow, the one Germanic twin, Hengist, may have been associated with the war-horse, while his brother, Horsa, may have been linked with the farm animal. This hypothesis is, admittedly, based on speculation. Nevertheless, the curious dis¬ tinction in the names of the pair, viz. Hengist/Horsa, may well point
to such a dual aspect of the horse. Other than the fact that Horsa gradually fades into oblivion, the records of the exploits of the heroes offer no evidence of separate functions. A folk legend recorded in modern Germany however, offers a remarkable example of a pair of brothers with distinct unctions. The legend reports that an aged count, when near death, decided t bestow upon his two sons the implements that would determine t leir respective careers. To the one son he gave a sword and the instruc¬ tions to use his strength to defend the castle. To the other son he gave a plow, and he instructed him to work the fields of the valley peace¬
fully.”31
*mbr and Assi the leaders of the Langobards were Ibor and Aio and the leaders of the Asdingi were Raus and Raptus. The evidence points clearly to a euhemenzation of Dioscuric divinities in each of these cases. See N. Wagner, ‘Dioskuren Jungmannschaften und Doppelkonigtum,” ZDPh 79:1-17, 225-247 <19*»). See also

Although it may seem fantastic to assume that this modern legend represents the survival of an ancient mythological tradition, the similarity with the Indo-European theme is so striking that this legend cannot be ignored. Not only are the brothers given distinct roles to play, the distinction is precisely of the kind that is typical of other Indo-European pairs. The one brother, who bears the sword, represents the second function, while his brother, who works with the plow, represents the third function. I suggest that a euhemerized myth of the Germanic divine pair survived in oral tradition and came to be recorded in the form of a folk legend.
An even more striking treatment of this theme occurs in Spanish heroic tradition. Samuel Armistead has worked with the legends that treat the illegitimate birth of the Spanish hero, the Cid.32 Armistead
is able to demonstrate that at one time there were two contemporary epic traditions involving the hero’s birth. According to the one tra¬ dition, the Cid was a twin who was begotten when a knight forced himself upon a peasant woman. The woman later lay with her hus¬ band, at which time the twin brother was conceived. The most com¬
plete evidence of this theme has been uncovered in a passage of the second redaction (ca. 1504) of the Compendio historical, originally
written by Diego Rodriguez de Almela circa 1479. The passage in question attempts to discredit the report of the Cid’s illegitimate birth.33
Note also inasmuch as some say that the Cid was a bastard they are mis¬ taken about it. And the way in which those who have not read his history and chronicle say this is as follows: That is, that Don Diego Lainez, father of the Cid, before marrying Dona Teresa Nunez, mother of the Cid, on Saint James day in Vivar forced a peasant woman, a miller’s beautiful wife, at her house, and she conceived a son at that time. And the peasant, her husband, when he came home from the mill, seized her that same day, and she conceived another son at that time. And when they were to be born, the knight’s son was born first. And he looked like his father, very lively and full of grace; and the peasant’s [son looked] like his [father], very coarse. And when both brothers were five or six years old, the knight’s son made hobby-horses out of wood and lances and swords and other things pertaining to arms. And he called the young boys “knights” and ran about from place to place, and all his activities had to do with weapons and knighthood. And the peasant’s son made little oxen out of clay and plows of wood. And with these things and other sticks,
32 This information will eventually be published by Armistead in an article entitled "Two Rival Traditions Concerning the Parentage of the Cid.” I am grate¬ ful to Professor Armistead for providing me with this information and for the translation of the manuscript material. 33 “Compendio historial,” 2d redaction, Biblioteca Nacional Madrid, MS 1525, formerly F-115, fol. 248r, known as MS F.

which he had in his hand, he would plow along the floor, saying ‘Gee up here? and Gee up there!’ and those who saw them marvelled at it. Don Diego Lainez then took his son, who was called Fernan Diaz. And when he was of age to bear arms he was a good kmght and brave.
The relationship with the universal Dioscuric pattern, whereby
the one twin is begotten by a divinity and the other by a mortal can be clearly discerned in this passage, even though the material has been euhemerized. The theme of the dual paternity of the twins re¬ mains, and with it the distinction in the character of each of tie twins. Moreover, the distinction is of the specialized type that has been encountered in the Indo-European tradition. Namely, the one twin represents the second function, is consequently of heroic, war¬
like character, and is associated with the horse, while the other twin represents the third function, is of a docile, gentle nature, and is more interested in cattle, plows, and farming than in warfare. I sug¬ gest that this contrast between the Spanish hero and his twin brother not only represents the same contrast as one encounters in IndoEuropean mythology, but that this episode in the career of the Cid represents a heroic euhemerization of an Indo-European Dioscuric myth. The question of just how this theme found its way into the Spanish heroic tradition is left open at this time. This aspect of the
problem, however, certainly warrants further investigation. These various bits of information regarding the character and
function of the Indo-European twins when viewed singly may not appear too significant, but viewed altogether they add up to an im¬ pressive sum of evidence, showing clearly that the distinction in the function of the twins, as posited by Wikander for the Indo-Iraman tradition, is true for other Indo-European traditions as well More¬ over, this distinction bears a clear imprint of the tripartite ideology
of the Indo-Europeans.
Reflections on “yaozda,”
with a Digression on “xvaetvadaea”
JACQUES DUCHESNE-GUILLEMIN, University of Liege
Georges Dumezil published an article some twenty years ago en¬ titled “A propos de latin ms.”1 After recalling that the term has only
a profane value, namely ‘area of maximal action or pretension,’ but must previously have had a half-juridical, half-religious one, still reflected in iurare and ius iurandum, he asked the question: “What religious value?’’
The answer seemed to lie in a comparison between Avestan yaozda, which in the Videvdat means chiefly ‘to purify from the contagion of dead matter,’ and Latin iusta facere (‘to perform certain religious ceremonies called denicales feriae’). On the day of cremation, a bone was severed from the corpse; this os resectum (usually a finger bone) was then buried at the denicales feriae. If, however, the person had perished at sea (in navi necatus), no denicales feriae were to take place, since the family was then said to be pure: decrevit P. Mucius,
Cicero writes in De Legibus 2.22, familiam puram, quod os supra terram non extaret. This seems to prove, Dumezil writes, that iusta facere means not only granting the dead what they have a right to receive, but also purifying the family. The same would be expressed in Varro (De lingua latina 3.4) as familiam purgandam. Hence an intimate connection between iusta facere and yaozda can be deduced, with the common meaning ‘to purify from defilement by death.’

1958 that I asked for it), Dumezil wrote one of those pregnant dedi¬ catory lines of which he has a wonderful mastery, and which typify the constant revision to which a lifetime of work is being submitted by one of the most active, everlastingly young minds of our time: “Apr£s dix ans, bien des choses sont a changer.” He did not say which; but now, in his excellent La religion romaine arcliaique (Paris, 1966), although the phrase iusta facere is mentioned, no refer¬ ence at all is made to yaozda. Why? This is the question I tackle
below.2 Is the reason for Dumezil’s change of mind to be found in an article published in 1955 by J. de Bie in Le Mnseon}3 The author tries to reconstruct the semantic evolution of yaozda, drawing his evidence exclusively from Avestan texts. He distinguishes three stages, after first sketching the evolution of the Mazdean religion as he sees it. The first is a purely ethical stage, then (in his own words) “dans la fixation progressive du culte mazdeen, toute purification se lie de plus en plus fermement a des rites magiques bien definis,” with reference to J. Darmesteter and A. Carnoy. From this far too simple background three successive semantic values of yaozda seem to
emerge: 1) ‘to put in a state of moral purity, exempt from evil.’ Yasna 44.9 speaks of yaozda'ing the daena, an act performed, according to Videvdat 10.19, through good thoughts, good words, and good deeds. Yast 8 speaks in the same way of yaoida'ing the urvan, the daena, the
arjhvd; 2) the second stage is reflected in numerous passages of the Videv¬ dat in which yaozda means ‘purifying from the contagion of dead
matter,’ representing a shift from ethics to magic; 3) in the third stage even water is supposed to have been defiled by dead matter and must be purified; such is the case also of othei in¬
animate objects, cult implements, and the like. De Bie summarizes his view as follows: originally the word desig¬
nated the internal, moral attitude of “sinless, well disposed toward the Good and Ahura,” both in the passive sense of ‘agreeable’ and
in the active one ‘devoted.’ This linear evolution is allegedly that of the Mazdean religion itself. But such an assumption is obviously wrong. We recognize in the Avesta many elements older than the Gathic refoim with which __ f. 2 Dumezil also wrote an article on mos, “Ordre, fantaisie, changement dans les pensees archaiques de l’Inde et de Rome” (REL 32:139-160 [1954], comparing the term with Sanskrit mdya. This collocation also has been quietly dropped in La
religion romaine archaique. , 3 "Yaozda, etude d’un terme religieux avestique,” Le Museon 68:145-161.

they must later have been merged; defilement by contact with dead matter could have been one of them. Linguistically de Bie takes practically no account of the semantic correspondences found in yaos, ‘exemption from dead matter,’ and Sanskrit yos, ‘welfare, health, happiness.’
We conclude that de Bie’s article cannot have impressed Dumezil very much. What then can have made him find fault with his own? Perhaps de Bie, a beginner in Avestan, who has since gone over to the study of Greek grammar by means of computers, was misled by the chronological order that Bartholomae followed in his dictionary: beginning with Gathic passages, followed by the later Avestan ones. It is useful, in this case, to examine first the passages in which the meanings are similar to the Vedic ones. Such a procedure will be more in line with what Dumezil has done.
The first examples demonstrate a connection, in both Sanskrit and Avestan, between the term under study and life:
Rig-Veda 1.189.2 and elsewhere: tokaya tanayaya sdm yoh, ‘sei fiir den leiblichen Samen zu Wohl und Heil.’ Such a prayer is addressed to the waters in Rig-Veda 6.50.7 and 5.53.14, as pointed out by Dumezil in “A propos de latin ills.’"1 A parallel is present in the Avestan hymn to the goddess of waters, Anahita: yd vispanqm arsnqrn xsudra yaozdadaiti . . . hairisinqm zqQdi gargwqn yaozdadaiti . . . hairisis huzamito dadaiti... vispqm hairisinqm, daitim radwim paema
ava.baraiti (Yast 5.2), ‘Who yaozda’s the semen of all the males, the embryos of the females for birth; gives the females an easy childbirth; provides them with milk at the right moment.’ To which may be compared further on in Yast 5.5: ha me apo yaozdadaiti ha arsnqm
xsudra ha xsaOrinqm gargwqn ha xsaOinqm paema, ‘she yaozda’s me the waters, the semen of the males, the embryos of the women, the milk of the women.”
The next example in Yasna 48.5 is subject to a new interpretation, as distinct from Humbach’s translation: . . . vanhuya cistois syaoOanais armaite yaozda masya(i) aipi zqdsm vahista gavoi vgrgzyatqm, ‘. .. mit den Werken der guten Erkenntnis, o Gemassheit, . . . die mit
dem Menschen auch seine Nachkommenschaft gesund macht, soli der Kuh gegeniiber angewandt werden.’ Humbach makes cisti- the implied subject of vgrgzyatqm, but if we take armaiti- instead we ob¬
tain a rather remarkable agreement with the passage from Yast 5.2 quoted above, since Armaiti is the Gathic substitute for Anahita: ‘Armaiti, who also yaozda's man and his progeny.’
The second group consists of passages dealing with purification
* Op. cit., p. 100.



2O0 Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin
from defilement by death. In Videvdat 6 and elsewheie, the verbs pairi.yaozdd and us.sna, frasna are employed as near equivalents. One instance of yaozda (Videvdat 8.100) suffices: ‘Here I am, one who has touched the corpse of a man, and who is powerless in mind,
in tongue, in hand. Do yaozda me!’ In the third group yaozda is extended to the soul, urvan, daena, or
ayhva, as in Yasna 44.9: ycpn yaos daenqm (yaoz)dqne, die Gesinnung, die ich mir heilwirkend machen will, and this is accomplished
by means of good thoughts, good words, and good deeds. In the fourth group, fire has to be purified, for instance Zaradus
tr3m atrgm pairi.yaozdadantam (Yasna 9.1). In the fifth group, the act has to do with ritual cleanliness of
implements. It seems, then, from the main objects undergoing yaozda, namely, the semen, living beings, the soul, and fire, that we would be entitled to deduce an intrinsic affinity between yaos and life, and perhaps a new etymology: *yewes < *yew, ‘young,’ compare Sanskrit yosd,
‘woman,’ and Sogdian ync < *yavanika.5 To test this hypothesis, we may examine the means by which the
act is performed. We read in the descriptions of the bar3snum cere¬ mony that purification is made with water, sand, and gomez. Why is gomez, ‘bull’s urine,’ used? Is it assumed to have life-giving properties because it is near the semen and perhaps mingled with it, thus a
plausible antidote to anything connected with death? According to Videvdat 8.13, however, corpse-bearers may be puri¬ fied not only with the urine of cattle, but also with the mingled urine of a man and a woman who have performed the xvaetvadada.
A DIGRESSION ON XVAETVADA&A
History repeats itself. In 1888 the Parsi Darab Peshotan Sanjana published a book. The Alleged Practices of Next of Kin Marriage in Old Iran (London, 1888). The following year H. Hubschmann showed that although the Avestan evidence for the practice alluded to in the title is not decisive, inasmuch as no definition of xvaetvadada is given, the material in Greek and other foreign authors is overwhelming.6 This did not deter another Parsi, Jamshid Cawasji, from writing another book. Marriage in Ancient Iran (Bombay, 1965), in which he tries to revive Sanj ana’s theory that xvaetvadada had nothing td do with next-of-kin marriage. This may be pardon

able on the part of zealous people who tend to represent their re¬ ligion as it should be, rather than as it is; what seems less pardonable is for a European scholar such as Otakar Klima in his rejoinder “Zur Problematik der Ehe-Institution im alten Iran”7 to have made a rather heavy refutation of the Parsi thesis without reference to his predecessor Hubschmann or to L. H. Gray’s “Marriage, Iranian, Next-of-Kin.”8 He seems at least to have known Hubschmann’s arti¬ cle, since he refers in a footnote to the very volume of ZDMG in
which it appeared. Why then not cite him? It is certainly a pity that Klima completely ignored Gray or Otto Schrader, whose hints as to the origin of this Mazdean usage he might otherwise have followed. I allude to Schrader’s Reallexikon der indogermanischen Altertumskunde (Strasbourg, 1901), revised by Alfons Nehring more than thirty years ago, a work that needs yet
another edition. Anyhow, this is what may be said en attendant. Three hypotheses are possible as to the origin of this usage: (1) It may be a survival from a state of savagery, in which free intercourse between the sexes pre¬ vailed; (2) or it may be an exaggeration of a particular rule of mar¬ riage; (3) or it may have been borrowed from some indigenous popu¬
lation of western Asia. The third hypothesis may be rejected for lack of evidence, despite what Ghirshman writes: “Many figurines of a naked goddess have been found on prehistoric Iranian sites. This goddess probably [I do not see what makes this probable!] had as a consort a god who was at once and the same time both her son and her husband. Undoubtedly [this seems just a manner of speaking!] it is in this primitive religion that we should seek the origin of marriage between brothers and sisters—a custom common in Western Asia, which the Persians and later the Nabateans inherited from the indigenous population—or of the marriage, less often recorded, between mother and son.”9
The other two hypotheses are less fragile. The first one is based on Celtic facts. Among the ancient Britons, according to Caesar (Bellum
Gallicum 5.14) and Dio Cassius (Historiarum Romanarum 76.12; 62.6), women were the common property of their husbands. In Ire¬ land, if we are to believe Strabo (Geographica 4.4) and Jerome (11.7), intercourse with wives of other men, with mothers and sisters was fre¬ quent, and kinship ties were not an obstacle to marriage: Lugaid,

king of Ireland, married his mother; a king of Leinster had his two
sisters as wives. The second hypothesis is illustrated among the ancient Balts. It is true that Christoph Hartknoch’s statement in Alt- und nenes Preus¬
sen seems at first sight rather to bear out the first one;
. das die alten Preussen in ihrem Heyrathen gantz und gar auff keine Blut-Freunschaft oder Schwagerschaft gesehen, sondern haben auch Bluts-Verwandten einander geheyrathet und ist damn niemand ausgeschlossen gewesen als eine rechte Mutter. Denn dasz sie auch ihre Stiefmiitter haben heyrathen konnen . . . auch bey den Littauen hat es vor Zeiten in dem Heydenthum frey gestanden die Stiefmutter zu Weibern zu
nehmen.10
But the explanation furnished by Jacobus, “ein Pabstischer Gesand
ter,” proves that the passage alludes not to unruliness but to a per¬ fectly justified rule: “Cum enim pater aliquam uxorem de pecunia communi sibi et filio emerat, hactenus servaverunt, ut mortuo patre, uxor eius ad filium devolveretur, sicut alia hereditas de bonis com
munibus comparata.”11 The early Indo-European woman thus seems to have been regarded as either a toy or a chattel. But neither theory can account for the position accorded to women amongst the ancient Germans. The famous passages in Tacitus (iGermania 7-8) that follow seem to sup¬ port the view that they were human counterparts of sorts of the trivalent goddess of the Indo-Iranians: ad matres, ad coniuges uulnera ferunt; nec illae numerare et exigere plagas pauent, cibosque . . ‘the men take their wounds to their mothers and wives, and the latter are not afraid of counting and examining the blows, and bring food . . .’ (all this representing the third function); et hortamina pugnantibus gestant, ‘and encouragement to the fighting men’ (second func¬
tion); inesse quin etiam sanctum aliquid et prouidum putant, nec aut consilia earum aspernantur aut responsa neglegunt, more than
this, they believe that there resides in women an element of holiness and prophecy, and so they do not scorn to ask their advice or lightly
disregard their replies’ (first function). But if we are confronted with the three Dumezilian functions, why
do they appear in the reverse order, unless perhaps it be because woman belongs first of all to the third function? We further miss what
Scott Littleton refers to as the “corner-stone,” namely the character
ft

Reflections on yaoida 209
istic division of the first function into two halves. This makes the
proof of trifunctionality uncertain. Be that as it may, this enhanced position of woman would seem to take us back to the very ancient system of matriarchy, and it is per¬ haps in this context that we must interpret the indications of the xvaetvadaOa (for lack of a better explanation), since obviously in a matriarchal system the only way for a boy to inherit the family’s pos¬ sessions is to marry his sister. Presumably next-of-kin marriage is motivated by the desire to pre¬ serve the family from outside interference, a desire for some kind of purity. Consequently the urine of a couple united in xvetddas is a valid substitute for gomez because it is particularly immune from outside factors, with their possibly noxious influence. Such urine, and by extension gomez in general, thus appears to have been valued mainly for its cathartic powers rather than its lifegiving properties. With this may be compared the Pahlavi usage: the word, when not merely transcribed yozdas, is translated by pak kartan, or hac vinas pak dastan. And in the Bundahisn, when the semen of the Primeval Bull (or of Gayomart) is “purified” by the light of the moon or sun, the verb used is palut, ‘to cleanse.’
If we now follow the same line backward in trying to determine the original meaning of yaoida, we deduce that the connection of this term with life and death is only secondary and extrinsic, and that it means essentially ‘to render pure.’ We must now go back one step further and take Latin ius into account. This will be my third and final approach. An evolution parallel to that of ius, iustus is found, historically at¬
tested, in Latin proprius and its Romance representatives. In Latin the word means ‘belonging to someone particularly.’ In the Romance languages it came to signify ‘fitting’ and was borrowed into English with that meaning. The Oxford English Dictionary tells us that from 1225 on, properly is attested in the sense of ‘fittingly, suitably, appropriately, as it ought to be or as one ought to do; rightly, cor¬ rectly, duly, well; in accordance with social ethics or good manners’; proper also has the meaning ‘answering fully to the description; thorough, complete, perfect, out-and-out, now only slang and col¬ loquial.’
The last stage in the evolution was reached in French, in the six¬ teenth century, when propre, which hitherto had meant ‘appro¬ priate, fit,’ came to signify ‘clean.’
Given the parallel, the semantic evolution of Latin ius, iustus can be reconstructed as follows: starting from ‘exact sphere or domain’



Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin
it went through the notion of ‘how it should be’ to that of un¬ touched by violence; healthy.’ This last stage is indirectly attested
in iniuria, defined as follows in Rhetorica ad Herenmum 4-25-35: “Iniuriae sunt quae aut pulsatione corpus, aut conuitio aures, aut aliqua turpitudine vitam cuiuspiam uiolant.” Hence English injury, injure (this meaning does not appear in French except in the phrase les injures du temps, a Latinism attested only from the seventeeth century onward). The connection between bodily integrity and
“justice” is still illustrated in the phrase used when someone stumbles
and falls: “Are you all right?” We have therefore no difficulty in accepting the usual etymology
of Latin ius as *yewes, from *yew, ‘to join, to fit; hence*yewes, what fits, is fitting’ (cf. French justesse-justice), or ‘what is exact, unmixed, pure.’ The connection of this notion with life is then accidental: life is considered as pure from death, unhampered, unsullied by it. If
this meaning is frequently attested it is only because life and death
are so particularly important in the religion. The notion is easily further extended to the soul, which will be considered good because not diminished, not weakened by evil; and
finally it will extend also to inanimate objects. The application to life and death certainly dates back at least to Indo-Iranian times. We have noted a precise identity between Vedic tokaya yd} and the Avestan passages, both Gathic and later, in which Anahita or her substitute Armaiti favors the purification of the semen. The question is, last but not least, did not this extension date back still further and is it not reflected in Latin? This boils down to interpreting iusta facere: we are brought back to our begin¬ ning, without perhaps being any the wiser for all our roamings. To be precise, how can we interpret the passages in Cicero and Varro quoted above? What does familiam puram mean in the Cicer¬ onian passage where it denotes the family of a person killed at sea? In the absence of a good Latin dictionary, the answer is difficult (the Thesaurus has not yet reached the letter PI). Does the phrase mean, as Dumezil first suggested: ‘not subject to the necessity of being purified from a connection with a dead body’; or does it after all mean simply ‘not subject to the obligation of performing certain just actions, iusta’} Similarly, does ad familiam purgandam in Varro simply mean ‘to relieve the family from a moral obligation’? Is it this second possibility that caused Dumezil to hesitate and then, in La religion romaine archaique, drop all reference to yaozda in
dealing with ius}
The Three Functions of
Indo-European Tradition in the
“Eumenides” of Aeschylus
UDO STRUTYNSKI, University of California, Los Angeles
It was some thirty years ago that Georges Dumezil added the dimen¬ sion of comparative mythology to the field of Indo-European studies, transforming the beneficiaries of a common linguistic heritage into the bearers of a socially oriented mythological tradition, unique and distinct from that of the other peoples of the ancient world. Central to Dumezil’s thought is the notion of Indo-European tripartition: the “three functions” of Indo-European ideology comprising the char¬ acteristics of sovereignty, physical prowess, and fertility, wealth, and nourishment, which are represented on the level of social classes by a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and herdsmen-cultivators. This tri¬ functional pattern of thinking pervades all significant aspects of social life, amounts to a definition by the people of themselves, and finds reflection in the structure of their pantheon. Thus there are first-function gods related to the class of priests and characterized by sovereignty; second-function gods, patrons of the warrior class, who display military prowess; and third-function gods in whose charge has been placed the health, sustenance, and wealth of the entire people.1 While the pivotal areas where Indo-European traditions have been found, the Indo-Iranian, Roman, and Germanic, have provided ample comparative evidence in support of Dumezil’s thesis, ancient

Greek myth reflects but few Indo-European traits.2 These few have already been noted by Dumezil and his followers.3 Still, continuing
research makes it possible from time to time to add to their number. In a tradition such as that of Greece, however, which has been frag¬ mented and hidden under continuing change, any traces of an IndoEuropean heritage which might be uncovered are not often easily
recognizable.4 Certainly this is the case with the plays of Aeschylus. Although Aeschylus is for all intents and purposes the earliest of the Greek
tragedians,5 he is first and foremost a man of letters whose thought is his own. Aeschylus’ dependence upon Hesiod is not slavish, writes Friedrich Solmsen,6 and from this it can hardly be argued that his thinking was influenced by an even more distant Indo-European tradition. Nevertheless, elements of Indo-European thought have
already been found in one of his plays. Dumezil7 has noted that in the Persians, the lines of the dialogue between the ghost of Darius
and Atossa (714-715) parallel the words of Darayavahu in the Old
Persian inscriptions.

Three Functions of Indo-European Tradition in Eumenides 213
Darius asks:
rivi rpowq)] Xot/zoO ns ^X0e oK-qwTos rj oraens iroXei; In what manner [was the power of Persia destroyed]? Did some onslaught
of plague or sedition come upon the state?
Atossa responds:
OvSap&s' aXX’ an<f>’ ’Adqvas was KaretpOaprai orparos. Not at all, but near Athens our whole army has been destroyed.
Each of the three means of destruction mentioned represents an
attack on one of the three functions. Plague destroys the physical well-being of a people and refers to the third function; sedition indi¬ cates a crisis of sovereignty, thus referring to the first function; and the annihilation of Persia’s military power represents a defeat for the second-function warrior class. Significant is the fact that it is the destruction of all of Persia, of the society as a whole, which is
at issue. For this reason,8 all three functions must be mentioned, despite the fact that the actual fall was a second-function matter. What must be kept in mind about this example, however, is the
fact that while it is unquestionably Indo-European, it does not belong to the tradition of Greece but to that of Iran. As Dumezil points out, “La publicity que le Grand Roi (Darius I) avait donnee a ses succes, a ses experiences, a ses pensees, avait pu par bien des intermediaires, clepuis les Ioniens de l’empire jusqu’aux prisonniers de Salamine, de Platees, d’Eion, atteindre les Athdniens ses vain
queurs et vainqueurs de son fils.”9 Unlike the Persians, the Eumenides is a play that concerns itself with traditions that are distinctly and exclusively Greek. But before
examining these traditions for whatever traces of Indo-European thought they might contain, it is necessary to isolate them from
what might be properly called the literature of the play. This task has been immeasurably simplified by the work of Jean Defradas,10 who has examined the legend of Orestes upon which Aeschylus drew, in the light of its development from the earliest ver¬ sions, through the transformations it experienced at the hands of the priests of Apollo at Delphi, until it gained currency in Athens at the end of the fifth century b.c. At that time the legend recounted how Orestes, son of Agamemnon, on the orders of Delphic Apollo avenged his father who had been murdered on his return from

Troy by Aegisthus and Clytemnestra. After Orestes has killed his mother he is pursued by her Erinyes, but Apollo, who had oidered the crime, wards off the Erinyes, and taking the guilt upon himself,
sees to it that Orestes is acquitted by a human tribunal. This version is radically different from what is found in Homer’s
Odyssey (1.30 ff., 3.93 ff-. 3-247-275. 3-301-3!2, 4-5*4 ff-)- There the punishment of one’s father’s murderer is a question of honor. In
the later classical conception of the problem, personal honor is re¬ placed by a moral debt to the person killed. This development, however, gives rise to the question whether it is not a gi eater crime
to fulfill one’s duty when avenging the murder of one’s father de¬ mands the killing of one’s mother. Thus, as soon as the act of revenge ceases to be automatic and a moral conflict arises, the intervention of a god becomes necessary.12 The vengeance that Orestes takes upon his mother is not a natural duty and for this reason must be considered a crime. Only a god can order Orestes to commit this crime and then assume the responsibility for it. The purification of Orestes is then part and parcel of a new concept of the problem. The Homeric avenger becomes a murderer who is soiled by his act and has need of a religious purification of it. Apollo is the proper purifier because he purified himself from Python s blood and drew Orestes to himself as he had drawn Herakles, soiled
by the blood of his children.13 For this reason Defradas can write,14 “Oreste tient, dans la mythologie delphique, une place a part: il est etroitement lie au dieu de Pytho, au point que 1 on a cru pouvoii
l’identifier avec lui.” A comparison of Homer and Aeschylus reveals that the latter
introduced a number of new themes: the curse of the House of Atreus; the problem of Orestes; Agamemnon’s own guilt as com¬ pared with that of Clytemnestra; and finally the shifting of the
role of the principal murderer from Aegisthus to Clytemnestra. Cer¬ tainly the theme of the son who murders his mother is not unique in

Three Functions of Indo-European Tradition in Eumenides 215
Delphic literature. There is the legend of Alcmaeon,15 son of Amphiaraus, who is ordered by the Delphic oracle to kill his mother in revenge for her designs upon his father’s life. His deed brings the Erinyes of his mother down upon him until his subsequent purifi¬ cation at Delphi. There are also the versions of the Oresteia of Pindar and Stesichorus which attest the Delphic influence.16 Both these authors share with Aeschylus this trait that Clytemnestra is the principal murderer of Agamemnon. Pindar shares one other trait with the author of the Eumenides: he presents Orestes as forced to punish his mother by virtue of the patriarchal law whose Dorian character is a significant aspect of the Delphic tradition. One need only compare this story of Orestes with that of Periander, tyrant of Corinth, who killed his wayward wife with impunity. Not only was vengeance by her relatives out of the question, but Periander him¬
self was later counted among the seven sages.17 This patriarchal law plays a role in the Eumenides when Apollo introduces it as part of the defense argument during the trial of Orestes (658 ff., 736 ff.). Apollo’s position is that the father is superior to the mother because his seed is the true source of life. The murder of a father is then a greater crime against the “Han vital” of nature than is the murder of a mother. When Athena joins her voice with Apollo’s, the argument carries the day against the Erinyes. Defradas’
following comment can be applied to this:
Ce systdme patriarcal devait appartenir en propre a une ideologic dorienne. La socidtd dorienne, indo-europdenne dans son essence, s’est opposde semble-t-il, 4 la socidtd dgdenne, oil dominait le matriarcat.

solidarity des combattants contre la femme qui a tue un soldat, quand Apollon oppose a la mort de Clytemnestre celle d Agamem¬
non.”19 The Delphic aspects of the Orestes legend can be summed up as the following: Apollo orders the murder of Clytemnestra;20 Apollo announces the purification of Orestes at Delphi;21 and Apollo de¬ fends Orestes by an argument that clearly favors the notion of patriarchy over that of matriarchy. It is the presence of Apollo and his close ties to Orestes which form the core of the Delphic legend. With this core Aeschylus has fused the Attic traditions of the found¬ ing of the Areopagus at Athens and the establishment of the cult
of tlte Eumenides, just as in the Prologue to the play he presented an Athenian version of the installation of Apollo at Delphi.22 There are, however, two Athenian institutions in the domain of
criminal law which also attest contact between Delphi and Athens, the Delphinion and the Exegetes. Both apply to the case of Orestes. In addition to the Areopagus and the Palladion, there was a third tribunal at Athens which was the “most sacred” (Aytiirarov), that
of the Delphinion, where it was decided whether or not a crime was permissible (ocrtor) in accord with the religious laws.23 The tradition of the Delphinion was brought to both Delphi and Athens by Cretan navigators in the eighth century. Therefore one must speak of an assimilation of a Cretan god and Apollo at Delphi, and then
of Apollo at Delphi, and Apollo, god of the Delphinion, at Athens. In assigning to Apollo the role of defense counsel in his play, Aeschylus was giving a Delphic and even more ancient—and thus
more venerable—origin to an Athenian legal fact.24

Considered as a trifunctional ordering, this but reinforces the argument of this article. 23 Defradas, op. $it., p. 191: cf. also the Law of Dracon in Inscriptiones Graecae 1.115: Demosthenes) Contra Aristocrates 66, 74; Aristotle, Constitution of Athens 57.3; Pausanias 1.28.10. 24 Defradas, op. cit., p. 192.

Three Functions of Indo-European Tradition in Eumenides
An Athenian legal tradition even more relevant to the case of Orestes is that of the Exegetes.25 These were interpreters of ancestral religious laws and were associated with the purification of the crim¬
inal in matters concerning the family. The function of the Exegete was to determine if there were any extenuating circumstances when a crime was committed. Apollo was associated with these exegetes at Athens in decrees appearing about the middle of the fifth cen¬ tury.26 Since these texts apply to the Trarpia, the laws of the an¬ cestors, Apollo can be connected with them, not directly as the Pythian god, but as Apollo TvarpCnos, the ancestor of the Ionians, father of Ion, who was in the fourth century assimilated to the god
of Delphi.27 Direct reference to the tradition of the Exegetes can be found in the texts of Aeschylus. In the Choephori, Electra, interrogating the Chorus how she should best honor the memory of her father, employs
precisely the word that designates the act of the exegete: (118)
Tt 4>te', 8l8o.ctk’ ixiretpov e^n]yovp.evr). Later Orestes is asked by the
Chorus, as an exegete might be asked, in what manner Agamem¬ non’s death was to be revenged on his wife and her lover (552 ff.): i&yov 0(Xots. In the Eumenides Apollo himself appears as an
exegete. The Chorus of the Erinyes asks Orestes (595): o navns Qnyeirb aoi injrpoKTOveLv j And Orestes, turning to Apollo, asks the god as one would ask an exegete, to bear witness on his behalf (609 ff.): "HSt? 08 p.aprvpr](Tov- eijrjyoO 8e pot, ’’A7roXXov, el oiiv 8'lkp
Kar'eKTavov. This additional link which the traditions of the Delphinion and the Exegetes provide between Orestes and his purifier Apollo causes Defradas to observe,28 “Tous les Apollons convergent dans l’Apollon pythien . . . Apollon devient le prototype de meurtrier legitime qui
se soumet a la purification apr£s la mort de Python.”
until a reconciliation between him and the parents o£ his victim is achieved; cf. Glotz, op. cit., pp. 309 ff. This theme is picked up in the Eumenides where Orestes tells of wandering in exile before reaching Athens (443 ff.). 25 Texts concerning the existence of Exegetes in Athens are listed in Defradas, op. cit., p. 205. 26 Ibid., p. 198; cf. also a decree in 431 to accord a sacrifice to Apollo in Inscrip¬ tiones Graecae 1.78: rot [’AirdXXoj/i Sva-ai ejr]«54 dvetXev tavrov ix<reyert[v ytvbptvov ’A8(valoi]s, and an analog in Inscriptiones Graecae 1.77.9 ff-: hard rh pavrkiav hk]v ho ’Att6XXov at'XeXpd txWhybpe[vos to. warpia]. Cf. also Plato, Republic 4.427c. 27 Defradas, op. cit., pp. 198-199. Judging from what Defradas says, one might consider that a gradual assimilation of the two Apollos began earlier than the fourth century and that the Oresteia of Aeschylus represents a step in this process. 28 Ibid., 204.

Defradas29 has already alluded to the Indo-European character of Apollo’s argument in favor of patriarchy, which links the god of Delphi to the Spartan warrior class. A. Yoshida30 has indicated that
the traditions found at Delphi are in some instances marked by Indo-European traits. What now remains to be done is to show how Apollo, the dragon-slayer, relates to Indo-European tradition. Aeschylus lets Apollo allude to his feat of slaying the Python in the lines with which he wards off the Furies from Orestes by threat¬
ening them with physical violence (179-183):
Out of this temple I I command you, go at oncel Quit my prophetic sanctuary, lest you feel The gleaming snake that darts winged from my golden bow. And painfully spew forth the black foam that you suck From the sour flesh of murderers.31
The presence of the bow and the metaphor “snake” for “arrow ’ refer to the weapons with which Apollo killed the Python. While the Homeric hymn mentions only one arrow that kills a dragoness, in the legend of Simonides the dragon is male and is called Python. Apollo vanquishes him with a hundred arrows.32 A version that appears to have been the most popular after 300 b.c. has Apollo killing the dragon at Delphi with many arrows and then leaving for Tempe or Crete to be purified of blood pollution. Another Delphic account, this time in euhemerizecl form, tells how the son of a cer¬ tain Krios, who ruled in Euboea, plundered Apollo’s shrine at Delphi. Apollo promises to send his arrows upon this bandit and then have himself cleansed of blood pollution by the Cretans.33 Finally, a Sicyonian legend mentions how Apollo and Artemis came to Aigialeia seeking purification for the killing of Python.34 The guilt that the death of the dragon brings upon the slayer is best paralleled in the Indie tradition of the warrior god, Indra, whose slaying of the tricephalic dragon Visvarupa is a sin.35 The

nature of this sin, which is recounted in the fifth chapter of the Markandeya Purana, has been explained by Dumezil:86 “Indra tue d’abord le monstre Tricephale, meurtre necessaire, car le Tricephale est un fleau menaqant pour le monde, et cependant meurtre sacri¬
lege, car le Tricephale a rang de brahmane et il n’y a pas de crime
plus grave que le brahmanicide.” Fontenrose37 recognizes another parallel between Apollo and In¬ dra, this time in the legend of Indra’s killing of the dragon Vftra: “As early as Rig Veda 1.32 Indra fled after Vritra’s death. In later sources his flight and death are combined with his need for purifica¬ tion after blood guilt. In this the Indra-Vritra myth offers a re¬ markable parallel to the Apollo-Python myth in both Delphian and
Sicyonian versions.” It might be added that the legend of Indra’s killing of the three¬ headed son of Tvastar has been compared by Dumezil with the Roman legend of the battle between the three Horatii and the three
Alban Curiatii, found in the first book of Livy. The third of the Horatii can be related to Trita Aptya, Indra’s helper in the dragon slaying. Trita Aptya incurs guilt by killing a relative and a Brahman;
the third of the Horatii, upon returning to Rome, slew his sister because she mourned the death of the Alban to whom she was be¬ trothed. Both Trita Aptya and the Roman champion then had to
undergo ritual purification.38 In the Eumenides, the story of Orestes offers some striking paral¬
lels to that of Trita Aptya and the third Horatius. In each case the crime is defined as the murder of a relative. In each case the mur¬ derer must be cleansed of his guilt. Orestes kills his mother upon the command of Apollo. Trita Aptya kills the three-headed dragon
as the helper and ally of Indra. Both Apollo and Indra themselves undergo or have undergone ritual purification. From these parallels, and bearing in mind that the legend that
provides the core for the play of Aeschylus is itself Delphic and therefore exposed to the influence of Indo-European thought, it
is tempting to assume that the Apollo who appears in the Eumenides, by virtue of his patriarchal bent, his near identification with Orestes, both as criminal and as purifier, and the parallels that his own
European tradition. For another Greek example of dragon slaying as a sin, cf. ibid., p. 117 and passim; see also Fontenrose, op. cit., pp. 306-320; both discuss the legend of Kadmos who killed the dragon-son of Ares. 36 Dumezil, L’ideologie tripartie, p. 30. 37 op. cit., p. igg. 38 Dumezil, Aspects de la fonction guerriere, p. 40.

Python-slaying has in the Indo-European tradition of the warrior
class, is a god of the second function.39 Turning our attention to Athena, we find a goddess who has done as much as has Apollo in aiding the cause of Orestes, if not mote. Yet there is a difference in their characters and in the means they employ to achieve their common end. While Apollo succeeds only in antagonizing the Erinyes, Athena opposes them with modera¬ tion and reason. Apollo threatens the Furies with shafts from his bow; he acts as defense counsel for Orestes. Athena promises the Erinyes a new kind of justice and establishes the court of the Areo¬
pagus over which she presides as impartial judge. Yet she is not impartial. When the votes of the jurors are evenly divided between conviction and acquittal, Athena casts hers in favor of Orestes in a speech in which she reveals herself to be a member of the patriarchal party whose argument Apollo had put forward
earlier (735 ff.):
No mother gave me birth. Therefore the father s claim And male supremacy in all things, save to give Myself in marriage, wins my whole heart’s loyalty. Therefore a woman’s death, who killed her husband, is, I judge, outweighed in grievousness by his.
When the Erinyes protest the verdict and threaten to inflict
sorrow and pestilence upon Athens in revenge, Athena soothes them with kind words, telling them that they have suffered neither dis¬ honor nor defeat. When this course seems ineffectual, her tone
changes (825 ff.):
I alone among the gods Know the sealed chamber's keys where Zeus’s thunderbolt Is stored. But force is needless.
Athena then offers the Erinyes an honored place in the society. In so doing, she describes her own social role in the following way
(914 ff.):
I will conduct their valiant arms to victory, And make the name of Athens honored through the world.
These last lines are the only clear indication in the play of what Athena’s function is.40 Yet in their light the other lines that have been quoted fall into place. Athena is at the side of Apollo, the second
39 Another treatment of Apollo as a second-function figure, this time, however, of Apollo the physician who is related through Asklepios to Rudra, is found in H. Grdgoire, R. Goossens, and M. Mathieu, Asklepios, Apollon Smintheus et
Rudra, MARB 45.1 (Brussels, 1949). 40 Orestes, it is true, referred to Athena as a warrior when he first approached her shrine at Athens; cf. Eumenides 295 ff.

function god, and cooperates with him in the defense and purifica¬
tion of Orestes. It was she who gave him sanctuary at Athens from the wrath of the Furies, just as Apollo had done at Delphi. And it was to her that Apollo had sent Orestes, that she might fiee him
from his pursuers once and for all. Yet Athena takes on dimensions larger than Apollo, not only in
her founding of the court of the Areopagus which brings legal juris¬ diction to the warrior function, but in her concern for the defense
of the city from the fury of the Erinyes. Apollo represents the ruder aspects of the warrior function (cf. Rudra and the Maruts, n. 39 above), while Athena is entirely civilized (cf. Indra). She is anxious
to avoid civil strife in Athens (854 ff.). Her acts of conciliation are motivated by this concern, but it is Athena’s great power, her knowl¬ edge of how to wield the thunderbolt of Zeus, which allows her to
be generous with a defeated enemy. Athena is more important than Apollo because she is responsible for the military protection and regulation of the entire Athenian society.41 Her second-function role in the play thus does not depend entirely on her relationship to Orestes. Rather, it is outlined in unequivocal terms by the poet when he contrasts the function of the goddess with that of the newly established Eumenides. Athena is par excellence the warrior
goddess of Athens. What is found in the play is found also in the tradition. Athena
is a second-function figure not only at Athens42 but, as Yoshida43 has noticed, also at Delphi, where as Athena Pronaia she is de¬ picted as fighting under the command of Zeus against the giants. Like Indo-European goddesses in general, however, and specifically
the Indie Sarasvatl and the Iranian Aradvl Sura Analnta, Athena also appears as a transfunctional figure. In the feast of Panathenaia held at Athens she is described as Hygieia, Polias, and Nike (.InscripHones Graecae 21.i63), which Vian44 has noted as representing the
third, first, and second functions, in that order.
41 Orestes is a second-function figure by virtue of his identification with Apollo. Athena as his judge exercises authority over a second-function figure. Yet the founding of the Areopagus is of the first function (Mitra), and the general guard¬ ianship of Athens makes Athena seem more like a sovereign Aryaman figure (in
Durnczil’s opinion). „ _ .... 42 For treatments of the warrior-function of Athena cf. M. P.

The term “function,” as Dumezil uses it, refers in this broadest sense to a sphere of power and responsibility. Yet it is not a sphere that exists in isolation. Each function is, as Littleton points out, “in a mathematical sense, a function of the others.” Apollo’s power rests in his being lord of Delphi, and his responsibility is the protection
and purification of Orestes. Athena is also the protectress of Orestes, but she is guardian of Athens as well. Apollo’s weapon is the tradi¬ tional bow with which he killed Python. Athena, however, alludes to wielding the thunderbolt of Zeus, which is an indication that the authority she exercises in the play of Aeschylus is not her own, but has been delegated to her by the lord of Olympus. This reference to Zeus is but one of many in the text which reveal that Zeus, al¬ though he never appears on stage or speaks a line, is very much at the center of the action. In the Prologue the priestess of Delphi, recounting the history of the oracle, gives Zeus the prominent position. Not only is he the god
who established his son Apollo as present ruler and irpo<i>i]T7]% Atos
(Eumenides ig, 616 ff.), the interpreter to mankind of his father’s word and will; he is also the supreme Fulfiller who guarantees that what has been prophesied will come to pass. The Delphic oracle, in effect, begins and ends with Zeus.
The subservient roles that Athena and Apollo play with respect to Zeus are recognized by the Erinyes. They address god and goddess as daughter and son of Zeus (415, 150). The Erinyes themselves agree to let Orestes be tried because they trust Athena’s wisdom and her father’s name (435—440). The arguments and evidence put forward during the first trial are full of references to Zeus. Apollo tells the Erinyes that Clytemnestra’s crime cannot go unpunished because the marriage of Zeus and Hera serves as a model for the sanctity of all marriage bonds (154 ff.). His patriarchal argument, that a wife’s murder of her husband is a worse crime than a son’s murder of his guilty mother, is based on this model. And Athena, in freeing Orestes, echoes these sentiments by announcing that for her the father’s word was law because she herself had no mother (735 ff.). The issue of the trial is decided by one consideration only: the will of Zeus. Apollo presents the deciding argument when he announces that Zeus himself commanded the killing of Clytemnestra (610 ff.). Next to this fact all arguments pale. Orestes slew by the will of Zeus as interpreted by Appllo (616 ff.); Zeus acquits him through the mouth
of Athena (797 ff.’, 763, 663 ff.).45 And so Athena can say to the
Erinyes (824 ff.):

Three Functions of Indo-European Tradition in Eumenides 223
You call on Justice: I rely on Zeus. What need To reason further?
A link between Zeus and Orestes is found in the concept of the
suppliant. Orestes is told by Apollo to go to Athena as a suppliant (78 ff.). Athena protects Orestes the suppliant because Zeus is the protector of suppliants who purified Ixion (440). Apollo has no fears that his shrine will be polluted as a result of his purification of Orestes because Zeus, who had set the precedent with Ixion, did
not suffer any pollution as the result of his act (7J5 ®-)- an earlier play of Aeschylus, The Suppliant Maidens, Zeus himself is char¬
acterized as a suppliant (1):40 Zeus pev a<pLKTo>p. This adds a new di¬ mension to the conflict. Apollo has already been identified with Orestes and shown to be the mouthpiece of Zeus. Now Orestes is linked to Zeus as a suppliant. The guilt for the murder of Clytem¬ nestra is passed on from Orestes to Apollo and from Apollo to Zeus, and each must answer for it. The purification of Orestes occurs at the hands of Apollo, but also at the hands of Zeus. Not only do Orestes and Apollo plead before the court: Zeus, in the final lines of the play, is described as “Zeus the Pleader” who “crowned per¬
suasion with success” (972—974)- justifying the act of Orestes, Zeus
has justified himself. It is a success in which Apollo does not directly share. Orestes
gains his life and regains his innocence. There his story ends. But Athena gains freedom from civil strife in Athens (854 ff.), the recog¬ nition and acceptance of her Areopagus, and a reconciliation with
the Erinyes who become the patron goddesses of wealth, fertility, and nourishment. This is the second part of the story, the main part, for which the trial and acquittal of Orestes serve only as a test case. This is the success that Zeus gains through his role as Pleader, that human justice tempers the justice of nature with reason and intel¬ ligence.47 But he gains it in the same way as he pleads, indirectly
and from a distance. Littleton48 points out that Dum&zil has been loath to regard Zeus as a first-function figure. His weapon, the thunderbolt, is found in Indo-European tradition, as Yoshida49 has remarked, dans les
46 Jbid., 201. . 47 Cf. Vian in his paper “Le conflit entre Zeus et la Destinee, REG 55:190 (1942): Murray, op. cit., 84-85: Solmsen, op. cit., p. 163: “It is justice and mod¬ eration which save him and ensure the eternal duration of his kingdom. Just as the Areopagus, the incorruptible organ of Justice, will be forever a bulwark of Athens, so the spirit of Justice will be a stabilizing factor for the world govern¬
ment of Zeus.” 48 op. cit., pp. 196-197. 49 Op. cit., p. 9.

mains des dieux de la deuxieme fonction.” But Zeus does not make use of his weapon. Nor does Athena, who refers to it. It looms only as a distant threat, as distant as Zeus himself. Yet distance does not hinder his efficacy. Zeus is in command of the action through his agents, and the final victory goes to him. The power and responsi¬ bility that Athena and Apollo have as second-function figures derive from Zeus. By virtue of his sovereignty he cannot be considered as belonging to any other than the first function. Yoshida himself admits that the thunderbolt in the hands of Zeus at Delphi, “semble avoir eu . . . plutot la valeur d’un moyen d’action royal qui permettait au
dieu souverain de diriger l’action de loin sans s’y engager veritablement.” This, too, is the thunderbolt-wielding Zeus who appears in the eighth book of the Iliad.50
The alliance between the first and the second functions, as mani¬ fested by Zeus, Athena, and Apollo, is a theme common to IndoEuropean tradition. The two superior functions unite to conquer the third and thus bring the latter into the social system. Dumezil51 has isolated three instances of this theme. In India the third-function Asvins were not incorporated into the society of the gods until after a violent conflict with the “two forces’’ (ubhe virye), which was fol¬ lowed by a reconciliation and a pact. In Germanic tradition there is
the war between the Aesir, the dominant group of gods to which Odin, Tyr, and Thor belong, and the lower group of Vanir, com¬
prising Freyr, Njordr, and Freyja. After their defeat, the Vanir are brought into the community. In the Roman tradition of the Sabine war it is not gods but men who fight, but as Dumezil has repeatedly pointed out, early Roman “history” is euhemerized Indo-European
myth. The first book of Livy describes how the Romans under their early kingship were a militarily strong people but lacked women
to bear their next generation. Sabine women were noted for their
voluptuousness, to say nothing of their fertility. But their king, Titus Tatius, would not agree to let the Romans marry them. The women were then tricked into entering Rome, where the Romans
took possession of them. In the battle for their release Titus Tatius was defeated by the Romans. The incorporation of the Sabines into Roman society is revealed by the list of the three original
50 Ct. Iliad 8.69-77, >33-138, 170-171, 402-406, 416-420, 455-456, and see Nilsson, Geschichte der griechischen Religion, I (2d ed.), 368-369. 51 L’ideologie tripaftie, pp. 56-57.

Roman “tribes,” the third of which is called Titienses after Titus Tatius, and is charged with the maintenance of physical well-being. At the end of the Eumenides, Athena asks the Erinyes to stay at Athens and accept a new role, now that the power of Zeus has robbed
their old function of all significance. They ask her (892 fE.):
What prerogatives are mine?
She answers:
Such that no house can thrive without your favour sought.
Then they ask (901 fE.):
What blessings would you have me call upon this land?
And she replies:
Such as bring victory untroubled with regret; Blessing from earth and sea and sky; blessing that breathes In wind and sunlight through the land; that beast and field Enrich my people with unwearied fruitfulness, And armies of brave sons be born to guard their peace.52
In Celtic tradition there is a fragment from the mythological cycle which recounts the second battle of Moytura (Mag Tured), wherein the Tuatha De Danann defeat the Fomorians. One of the vanquished is Bress, once king of both peoples, but deposed because of avarice and forced to serve as guarantor of nourishment and prosperity for seven years without compensation. The account of how he saves his life from his conquerors provides an interesting parallel to the final
scene between Athena and the Erinyes. The dialogue takes place be¬ tween Bress, the first-function god Lug, and the judge Maeltne:53
bress: It is better to give me quarter than to slay me. lug: What then, will follow from that? bress: If I be spared, the kine of Erin will always be in milk. lug: That does not save thee: thou hast no power over their age or their offspring (?) though thou canst milk them.
Bress tries a second time:
bress: Tell your brehon that for sparing me the men of Ireland shall reap a harvest in every quarter of the year.

lug to maeltne: Shall Bres be spared for (giving) the men of Ireland a harvest of corn every quarter? maeltne: This has suited us: the spring for ploughing and sowing, and the beginning of summer for the end of the strength of corn, and the beginning of autumn for the end of the ripeness of corn and for reaping it. Winter for consuming it.
The third time Lug proposes Bress’ task:
lug: How shall the men of Ireland plough? How shall they sow? How shall they reap? After making known these three things thou wilt be spared. bress: Tell them that their ploughing be on a Tuesday, their casting seed into the field be on a Tuesday, their reaping on a Tuesday.
This fragment from Celtic tradition, the Aesir-Vanir conflict, and the Sabine war, as well as the battle of the Asvins in India, all speak of a reconciliation between figures of the first two superior functions and figures who perform third-function activities already before they are incorporated into the system and defined as the third function. In Aeschylus the Erinyes are not third-function figures before their transformation. True, they are earth goddesses, chthonic figures whose mother is Night54 (860 ff.), but their province is the revenge of blood crimes, wherein they resemble other Indo-European figures such as the Roman Parcae and the Germanic Norns;55 it is not the
nourishment and general well-being of a people. The Aeschylean conception of the Erinyes would seem to be based on Hesiod.58 Although he does not call them daughters of Night as Aeschylus does, Hesiod does mention them as having sprung from the blood of Ouranos when he was overthrown and emasculated by Kronos. What Aeschylus has done is to identify them with the Hesiodic Keres who are born of Night and who relentlessly pursue the sinner until he is punished (Theogony 220—222). Among the other children of Night, Hesiod lists the Moirai, which gives Aeschylus the opportunity to call the Erinyes their sisters “by the same mother.” This new structure allows the Erinyes to be reconciled with Zeus after the acquittal of Orestes, since Zeus’ insistence upon this acquit¬ tal was the basis for his reconciliation with the Moirai, a fact that
the final chorus celebrates (1045-1046):57 Zeus UavToitTas oiirco Moipd,

Three Functions of Indo-European Tradition in Eumenides 227
The probable source of the concept “Eumenides” or “well-disposed ones” is the Attic feast of the Semnai. As Solmsen (op. cit., p. 201) writes, “In effecting the transformation, Aeschylus made use of a well-established Athenian cult, that of the Semnai or Eumenides, who were worshipped in a cave on the slopes of the Areopagus and to whom—perhaps even at Aeschylus’ time—those acquitted by the
jury of the Areopagus used to offer sacrifice (cf. Pausanias 1.28.4 and 2.11.4).” Deubner58 points out that they remain subterranean crea¬ tures (thus chthonic like the Erinyes) but then goes on to say, “Von dem Opferfest war . . . das Geschlecht der Eupatriden wegen seiner genealogischen Beziehungen zum Muttermorder Orest ausgeschlos
sen. . . What occurs at the end of the play is simply a shifting of emphasis from the conflict between Orestes and the Erinyes to Zeus and the Moirai.59 The tradition of Orestes itself provides a common ground where the Erinyes and the Eumenides meet. But after the acquittal Orestes and Apollo depart from the scene, and Zeus through the person of Athena confronts the Furies whose justice he has re¬ placed with his own. At this point they are still Erinyes and represent
no more than that aspect of the third function which engages in con¬ flict with the two superior functions. It is only by accepting their
new role that they become Eumenides; they assume the proper re¬ sponsibilities of the third function which, working in cooperation
with the other two, provides a basis for the life of the entire society. One has the impression from reading Aeschylus that a social charter is being drawn up and that a new society is just now coming into
its own (916-926):
I will consent to share Athene’s home, To bless this fortress of the immortal powers Which mighty Zeus and Ares Chose for their habitation, The pride and glory of the gods of Greece, This prayer I pray for Athens, And guardian of their altars. Pronounce this prophecy with kind intent:
58 Op. cit., p. 214. 59 Cf. F. Vian, REG 55:204 (1942): "L’oeuvre principale des Moires est 1' ‘antique partage’ qui a assigne a chacun sa place et son role dans le 'cosmos’. C est ce partage qui a donne aux Erinyes le Tartare pour s£jour et pour fonction le chStiment des crimes et des affaires de sang.” But on page 205 he makes the point that Zeus’s function is to execute the laws. The function of the Erinyes has been transferred to Zeus; it is a first-function activity that they have lost. Thus they retain and make the most of what remains: their chthonian third-function character.

Fortune shall grace her land with healthful gifts From her the rich earth engendered By the sun’s burning brightness.
In these lines are found a recapitulation and a reinforcement of the trifunctional structure found throughout the play: (1) Zeus, (2) Apollo and Athena, (3) Eumenides. Here this society is headed by the first-function god Zeus; and he is followed by Ares, in Greek tradition the unequivocal god of war. To these the Eumenides will add their name and their powers. This triad takes its place among other instances of Athenian trifunctionality: the four Ionian tribes: first-function Dias, second-function Athenai's and Posidonias, thirdfunction Hephaistias;60 in Aristotle’s Constitution of Athens61 the third-function Archon in charge of goods and possessions, the first
function Basileus whose realm is the celebration of mysteries and the direction of all sacrifices, and the second-function Polemarchos whose role was to keep an eye on strangers in and out of Athens. The social charter of Aeschylus is headed and embraced by Athena, repre¬ senting her country and her people, who under the transfunctional aspect of Panathenaia62 stands as the supreme symbol for the unity
of Athens.

Some Possible Indo-European Themes in the “Iliad”
C. SCOTT LITTLETON, Occidental College
It is fair to say that, of all relevant ancient Indo-European tradi¬ tions, that of the Greeks presents by far the greatest number of diffi¬ culties to contemporary students of Indo-European myth and epic. For the common, tripartite ideological inheritance, so clearly demon¬
strated by Georges Dumezil and his colleagues in the myths and epics of the Indie-, Iranian-, Italic-, and Germanic-speaking communities,1 is all but absent in the Greek tradition-despite the fact that this tradition is certainly the most voluminous and best preserved of the ancient Indo-European traditions. As Dumezil puts it, “La Gr6ce—par ran^on sans doute du «miracle grec», et aussi parce que les plus anciennes civilisations de la Mer £g£e ont trop fortement marqu6 les envahisseurs venus du Nord—contribue peu a l’etude compara¬
tive: meme les traits les plus considerables de l’h^ritage y ont £t£
profondement modifies.”2 Yet here and there, tucked away in a variety of contexts, a few bits
and pieces of the common Indo-European ideology have come to light,3 proving that the Greeks were not altogether ignorant of the

ideology to which, as Indo-European speakers, they were heirs. One
of the more recent (1964) and significant additions to this meager
store of evidence concerning the persistence of the Indo-European
ideology in the Greek tradition is A. Yoshida’s4 suggestion that it is
expressed in the embellishments on the shield of Achilles, as de¬
scribed by Homer in Book 18 of the Iliad. The purpose of this
paper5 is to build upon this foundation and comment upon the
extent to which the Iliad as a whole may perhaps reflect the common
Indo-European ideology. This is, of course, a matter that cannot
possibly be dealt with adequately in a paper of this scope. Yet given
the high probability that Yoshida is correct in his interpretation of
the shield of Achilles (I had come to similar conclusions before en¬
countering Yoshida’s article), a few observations relative to the epic’s
chief figures and events are in order, if only to point the way for
further investigation.
First, however, let us hear what Yoshida has to say about the shield.
Pointing out that Homer begins his description of the embel¬
lishments with images of the earth, the sky, and the constellations
(center of the shield), and ends it with an image of the sea (outermost
rim)—images that, he suggests, reflect a conventional cosmogonic
scheme—Yoshida goes on to assert that
Entre ces deux ensembles, c’est au contraire une serie de scenes decrivant la vie des hommes qu’a ciseltfes l’artiste. Or cette description est faite de trois parties, nettement distinctes, respectivement consacr^es aux activites relevant d’une des trois fonctions de l’iddologie indo-europienne.

Special thanks are due Professor Atsuhiko Yoshida who, although not a participant in the symposium in which this paper was initially read, has nevertheless contributed a great deal to its final form through his invaluable criticisms and suggestions.

prend essentiellement des combats, e’est-a-dire l’expression la plus typique
de la deuxiemc fonction. Ces tableaux antithetiques de la vie citadine sont compldt^s par ceux de la vie rurale, d’abord les travaux de l’agriculture, puis ceux de 1 61evage (541-589), e’est-a-dire les deux parties principals de l’activite nourriciere qui est un des principaux aspects de la troisieme fonction; de plus, dans la setne du xopos qui suit (590-606), des jeunes gens et des jeunes lilies, beaux et richement habilles, ex^cutent une danse joyeuse en se tenant par la main et font l'admiration de la foule immense qui entoure: jeunesse, beaute, richesse, joie populaire, tous ces elements appartiennent aussi k la complexe troisieme fonction. . . .6
The third-function character of the final scene, Yoshida suggests, is
strengthened by its mention of Ariadne: “grande deesse minoenne de
la vegetation.” To this I might add that there is also a great deal of
evidence for the association of dancing with a host of third-function
figures, especially the divine twins, in other Indo-European tradi¬
tions.7 It should be emphasized that this interpretation of the shield of
Achilles is phrased in thematic, contextual terms, and does not pre¬
tend to be predicated upon any set of philological premises, other
than the fact that the author of the tradition was an Indo-European
speaker. Nevertheless, as mentioned earlier, it does seem to me that
Yoshida is correct in his assumption that the tripartite Indo-European
ideological principles are expressed here and that their expression
unfolds in the canonical order so frequently found in Indie, Iranian,
Roman, and Norse materials. The uniqueness of this expression is
itself an interesting phenomenon, for if we examine that other fa¬
mous Greek shield, the shield of Herakles as described by Hesiod,
no clear parallels emerge. Although Hesiod’s description of the
Theban hero’s shield is perhaps modeled after the Homeric pas¬
sage in question, and despite certain very specific points of similarity,
notably the wedding sequence on the shield of Herakles, wherein
people “were bringing the bride to the groom, and the loud bride
song was arising” (line 274), the general character and order of the
scenes depicted are distinct from those on the shield of Achilles.
Why Hesiod failed to organize his description in terms of the
Indo-European ideology is a moot question, especially in view of
the strong probability that he was a younger contemporary of Homer
(or at least of the author of the Odyssey).8 Lattimore suspects that

the bulk of the description of the shield of Herakles (from line 57 on) may well be the work of a late interpolator.9 If this view is correct,
then perhaps by the time these later lines were composed the hold of the Indo-European ideology had largely given way, although there is nothing in the first fifty-six lines that would clearly indicate its presence. The problem is further complicated by the fact that in most other contexts Herakles is, as Dumezil has shown,10 one of the
most “Indo-European” of Greek figures. Withal, despite Hesiod’s failure to express the common IndoEuropean ideology in a closely analogous context, its presence in at least one important Homeric passage raises the question of
whether or not the Iliad as a whole reflects this ideology. Although it is certainly correct to assert that the Iliad is concerned primarily with the behavior of Achilles, his withdrawal and subse¬ quent return to the fray, and only secondarily with the siege of Troy,
it must never be forgotten that it is against this latter backdrop that the events relative to Achilles’ “wrath” take place. Indeed, it is against this backdrop of internecine military conflict that all the events described by Homer take place. Therefore, it seems fitting to begin by asking whether there are any other Indo-European mythic (or quasi-mythic) counterparts to such internecine strife.11 The answer is, of course, yes: to name but a few samples, the conflict
between the Panclavas and the Kauravas, as described in the Mahabharata; the conflict between Aesir and Vanir, which forms an im¬ portant element in the Norse tradition; the conflict between the Romans and the Sabines, as described by Livy, et al.12 In all such cases one segment of the society comes into conflict with another seg¬ ment, even though these segments may be formally distinguished,
as in the case of the Romans versus the Sabines. Now among the more interesting of Dumezil’s suggestions as to the character of the proto-Indo-European mythology is that it con¬ tained a myth concerning a conflict or “war” between representa¬
tives of the first two functions and those of the third.13 The clearest
9 Ibid., p. 9. 10 Dumezil, Aspects de la fonction guerriere, pp. 93 ff. 11 That the Achaean-Trojan confrontation was internecine seems certain; see for example Helen Thomas and F. H. Stubbings, “Lands and Peoples in Homer,” in A. J. B. Wace and F. H. Stubbings, eds., A Companion to Homer (London.
1963), pp. 283-310, gsp. 285-288. 12 For a discussion' of the Indo-European character of the conflict between the Romans and the Sabines, see Dum&il, La religion romaine archa'ique (Paris, 1966),
pp. 79-84. 13 Ibid.; see also Littleton, op. cit., pp. 11-13.
Indo-European Themes in the Iliad 233
reflexes of this assumed protomyth are to be found in the Norse and Italic conflicts just mentioned. In the Norse case it is certain that the Aesir, the dominant group of gods, to which Odin, Tyr, and Thor belong, are representatives of the first two functions, and that the Vanir, the losers in the struggle, to which Freyr, Njordr, and Freyja belong, are third-function figures. In the Italic case, the Romans, under the leadership of the warlike Tullus Hostilius (second func¬ tion), and after the successive reigns of Romulus and Numa (first function), engage in a conflict with their neighbors, the Sabines, who, as devotees of luxury, “la tranquillite,” and “la volupt<§,” are manifestly representatives of the third function.14 In both cases, the representatives of the third function—Vanir and Sabines—are de¬ feated and eventually integrated into the social and/or super¬ natural system, rendering it complete. (Elsewhere, I have suggested
that this theme of a “war between the functions” might well serve to explain, or sanction, perhaps, the lowly position of the cultivator in Indo-European society; he was the last to be admitted to it).15
Assuming Dumezil is correct in his interpretation of these two mythical (in the Roman case quasi-mythical) conflicts, is it possible to view the conflict between the Achaeans and the Trojans in the same light? The answer depends upon the extent to which it is pos¬ sible to assert that Homer, or at least the tradition upon which he drew, conceived of the Trojans in third-function terms. To begin with, there is the famous Judgment of Paris, which, ac¬ cording to Dumezil, contains perhaps the clearest single Greek ex¬ pression of the tripartite ideology.16 At the behest of Zeus, Paris agrees to award the golden “apple of discord” to the fairest of the
goddesses. The choice is between the regal Hera, the warlike Athena, and the voluptuous Aphrodite. So as to influence him in his choice,
each goddess, seen by Dumezil as representative of one of the three functions, offers Paris a gift: Hera offers world sovereignty (first function); Athena promises military prowess (second function); and Aphrodite tenders the gift of earthly pleasure (third function). Paris chooses Aphrodite, and thus, by alienating Hera and Athena (i.e.,
the first two functions), he sets the stage for what is to come. It is quite clear that, in making this choice, he has aligned himself and his people with a third-function divinity. Indeed, throughout the
epic, the only divine being firmly committed to the Trojan cause is Aphrodite; the other two former contestants in that prototypical



234
C. Scott Littleton
beauty contest never waver in their commitment to the Achaean
cause. Further evidence of the extent to which the Trojans, both in¬ dividually and collectively, manifest third-function characteristics can be seen in Homer’s descriptions of the city and its inhabitants. The city itself is consistently depicted as a center of wealth and a rich prize waiting to be sacked (cf. 2.133, 9.278, 22.116-118, and else¬ where); indeed, one of the reasons why Achilles withdraws from the fight is his expectation that he will be shortchanged when the spoils are distributed (1.164-171). Evidence of third-function character¬
istics can also be seen in the emphasis among the Trojans upon family life and the relationships therein. Perhaps the best example of this can be found in Book 6, wherein Andromache, her infant son in her arms, implores Hector to withdraw from the war (390 ff.). With the bitterness of one who prefers peace to war. Hector tells his wife that he must continue to fight; yet before taking leave of his family he finds the time to kiss and fondle his offspring (465-481). Moreover, throughout the conversation between Hector and Andromache there
is the implication that the cause is lost and that she and all the rest of the Trojan women will be carried off by the victorious Achaeans.
Here, of course, we can compare the fate of the Sabine women. In this connection it may be recalled that Dum^zil has suggested that third-function figures, although primarily concerned with the maintenance of tranquillity and physical well-being, are often de¬ picted as armed in a protective capacity. Typically, they do not in¬
stigate conflicts, but they are not exempt from them should they arise or should the domestic peace be threatened. The Roman figure Quirinus is often referred to as Mars qui praeest pad, and there are arma Quirini. The Norse Freyr is armed with a sword, and the Indian epic heroes Nakula and Sahadeva (projections of the Asvins) carry weapons and engage in battle.17 Although the chief Trojan figures, especially Hector, are depicted as doughty warriors, their prowess is displayed solely in defense of their homes and families,
they are never portrayed as aggressors. Turning to a consideration of the principal Trojan figures them¬
selves, it is possible that Hector and Paris are projections of the twin third-function figures so frequently encountered in the pantheons of the ancient Indo-European-speaking communities (e.g., the Vedic
Asvins, the GEeek Dioscuri). In order to support this contention, it is necessary to consider two of the chief figures in that other Indo
17 G. Dumezil, “Remarques sur les armes des dieux de ‘troisikme fonction’ chez divers peuples indo-europeens,” SMSR 28:1-10 (1957).
Indo-European Themes in the Iliad 235
European epic, the Mahdbharata. Some years ago (1947) Stig Wikander was able to demonstrate that the principal protagonists of the Indian epic were transpositions of the major Vedic divinities, and as such reflected the three Indo-European ideological func¬ tions.18 Yudhisthira was seen to be a projection of Mitra and thereby a representative of the first function; Arjuna and Bhima, respectively, were projections of the warrior divinities Indra and Vayu; while Nakula and Sahadeva were projections of the twin Asvins. In 1957. Wikander focused his attention upon the latter two figures and sought to differentiate them in terms of their respective roles in the narrative.19 Nakula, for example, is handsome, fearless, and a breaker of horses; Sahadeva is defined as peace-loving, an indifferent warrior,
and a keeper of cattle. Furthermore, although together they clearly serve as representatives of the third function, the differences between them would align Nakula more closely with the second function, while his brother is more firmly a representative of the third. In the Rig-Veda, common epithets reflecting the third function are used to refer to the Asvins, although these epithets invariably occur in pairs, and almost always in the same order. This order parallels the epithets used individually in the Mahdbharata for Nakula and Sahadeva. Moreover, many post-Vedic texts refer to one of the twins
as Nasatya and the other as Dasra. Wikander concludes that this distinction goes back to Proto-Indo-European times (or at least to the
period of Indo-Iranian unity).20 If we examine the epithets and characters of Hector and Paris,
some interesting parallels emerge. The most common epithet of
Hector is bnriSa/zos, ‘breaker of horses.’ Paris, however, is never so characterized; indeed, in his youth he was associated with the care of sheep, having been weaned by a band of shepherds.21 Hec
18 Stig Wikander, “Pandava-sagan och Mahabharatas mytiska forutsattningar,”
RoB 6:27-39 (1947). 18 S. Wikander, “Nakula et Sahadeva,” OS 6:66-96 (1957). 20 Ibid. Further evidence can be found in the Avesta, wherein there is only a single demon, Narjhaithya, whose name corresponds to Nasatya. The more be¬ nevolent twin seems to have survived demonization and persists, Wikander be¬ lieves, in the person of Atar, son of Ahura Mazdah; see also Ward, “The Separate Functions of the Indo-European Divine Twins,” above, pp. 194-195. 21 Cf. Apollodorus 3.148. Paris’ childhood conforms to the general heroic pattern, as delineated by O. Rank, Lord Raglan, and J. Campbell: although born of Priam and Hekabe, he was exposed at birth on Mount Ida as a result of proph¬ ecy that he would bring about Troy’s ruin. Like Oedipus, however, he was reared by shepherds, and it was only after reaching manhood that he was able to claim his birthright. The etymology of his name is obscure. H. Frisk [Griechisch.es etymologisches Worterbuch, II [Heidelberg, 1965], p. 275) suggests that it is perhaps Illyrian in origin.



2g6 C. Scott Littleton
tor’s character is that of a valorous and chivalrous warrior; Paris, despite his chief epithet, Alexandras (“Warrior, Champion), is char¬ acterized as an indifferent fighter (e.g., his duel with Menelaus, wherein he survives only with the aid of Aphrodite), and as a man devoted to the maintenance of physical well-being (or at least to his own sensual enjoyment). In short, the distinction between the two Trojan princes is broadly reminiscent of that between Nakula
and Sahadeva. Yet if Hector’s principal epithet and character resemble those of Nakula, his name would seem to be derived from the same IndoEuropean source as Skt. saha- (cf. Avestan hazah-, Gothic sigis, from Proto-Indo-European *segh-, ‘to withstand, to uphold ).22 One pos¬
sible explanation of this metathesis, so to speak, is that at some point
before Homer crystallized the tradition, the name of the Nakula figure had disappeared, and his epithets and personality came to
be assumed by the surviving Sahadeva figure, that is, Hector. At the same time, it would appear that the theme of a functional distinc¬ tion between the two did manage to persist, and that many aspects of the Sahadeva figure—though by no means all-were transferred to a new figure whose name has no connection with the Indian version, that is, Paris. One aspect that did not shift was the association with
cattle-keeping. It is remotely possible that the epithet “Alexandras,’ together with the curious equine simile that occurs in connection
with Paris near the end of Book 6 (506-512), wherein his movements are likened to “some stalled horse who has been corn-fed at the manger . . . ,” may be dim survivals of an earlier identification with the Nakula figure. By the same token, despite his epithet and mili¬ tary prowess, certain aspects of Hector’s character would seem to reflect Sahadeva; he is, as we have seen, a man who prefers peace to war, a man who would much prefer to live in harmony with his neighbors. Like Sahadeva, Hector is also a would-be peacemaker,
and this, too, may be a survival of his former identification. Whatever the reasons for this transposition, it seems to me that
the very existence of a philological connection between Hector and Sahadeva, coupled with the thematic parallels that can be demon¬ strated between the two sets of heroic siblings, are sufficient to make a strong case for the assumption that Hector and Paris are reflexes of the common Indo-European twin figures. The absence of any lineal connection between the Trojan pair and their divine counter¬ parts (Kastor and Polydeukes), a connection that, as I have said, can
22 Cf. J. Pokorny, Indogermanisches etymologisches Wdrterbuch (Bern, 1959),

Indo-European Themes in the Iliad a37
be demonstrated in the Indian tradition, does not appear to be an
insurmountable obstacle here. Indeed, the Dioscuri can be brought into the picture, for as the daughter of Leda, Helen is their sister.23 Thus, while Kastor and Polydeukes are not seen as lineal kinsmen of the Trojan princes, the implication of an affinal relationship seems quite clear. Elsewhere among the ancient Indo-European traditions associated with the
twins there is usually a close female relative present, oftentimes a sister, less frequently a spouse; compare, for example, Sarasvati, Freyja, and, as Donald Ward has recently suggested, Kudrun and SIta.24 That Helen, sister of the Dioscuri, and wife to Paris, fits this
pattern is a distinct possibility. In sum, the Trojans, individually and collectively, seem to repie
sent the third function. If this is correct, then the next task is to consider some possible Achaean candidates for the honor of repre¬
senting the first two functions. By all odds, the most logical candidate for the second-function
honors is the wielder of the shield discussed previously, Achilles-or, more properly, Akhilleus. He is far and away the most warlike figure in the epic. But what is more, his recalcitrant behavior, as described by Homer, generally conforms to what appears to be a common IndoEuropean pattern when it comes to warrior figures. Like Inclra,
Starcatherus, and Herakles, he is culpable. In his Aspects de la fonction guerriere,25 Dumezil suggested that the Indo-European warrior typically commits three characteristic “sins,” each of which is a viola¬ tion of one of the three ideological principles. Indra, for example, is an accomplice in the murder of a Brahman (the three-headed son of Tvastar, chaplain of the gods), displays cowardice in the slaying of Namuci (with whom he had sworn a treaty), and commits adultery with Ahalya, wife of Gautama. Starcatherus (Starkadr), as described by Saxo Grammaticus in Books 6-8 of the Gesta Danorum, commits a similar set of “sins”: he strangles a king (Wicarus of Norway), dis¬ plays cowardice in battle, thereby causing a war to be lost, and, for a price, agrees to kill the Danish king Olo while the latter is in the act of bathing and thus unable to defend himself.26 In the case of

Herakles, “le seul heros panhellenique,” as D umczil calls him, the sin
against the first function involves the murder of his children in de¬
fiance of the command that he perform the twelve labors, a command
issued by his sovereign, Eurystheus, and confirmed by the Delphic
Oracle. His sin against the second function involves the cowardly
slaying of Iphitos, who had come to claim his broodmares. His sin
against the third function involves his abduction of Astydamia and,
subsequently, of Iole. Like Indra, whose powers wane with each
“sin,” Herakles becomes impotent and eventually succumbs as a
result of his misdeeds. Although the parallels are admittedly imperfect, Achilles, too,
commits a set of sins against the established order of things. To
begin with, he defies the authority of his commander-in-chief, Aga¬
memnon, and withdraws from the war. Moreover, the immediate
cause of his defiance is the command that he give up a slave girl
(Briseis). Thus, in this one brief but crucial sequence (1.130 f.) can
be seen all the elements in the culpability of the Indo-European war¬
rior. Achilles defies authority (first function); he withdraws from
the conflict (second function); and he falls victim to his sexual de¬
sires (third function). The Achaean hero’s defiance of authority and
refusal to fight, to say nothing of his concern with his own sensual
enjoyment, are themes that occur over and over as the epic unfolds.
In the case of the latter theme, it is clear that during his withdrawal
he lives in a manner far more suited to a third-function figure than
to a representative of the second function. He has become concerned
with his own physical well-being to the exclusion of any concern
with the proper performance of his warrior role. A good example of
this can be seen in the famous interchange between Achilles and
Odysseus, wherein Odysseus, acting as Agamemnon’s emissary, offers
vast riches, women, and so on, if only he will return to the war
(9.252 f.). It would appear that in this context, at least, Achilles is
treated as if he were a third-function figure.
Another aspect of Achilles’ career which bespeaks the third func¬
tion is his transvestitism at the court of Lykomedes of Skyros. The
story, not contained within the framework of the Iliad proper (cf.,
for example, Apollodorus 3.1 74)> is that Thetis had dressed her
son as a girl and had hidden him among Lycomedes’ women, her
purpose being to spare him from certain death in the then imminent
war. Achilles’ location does not long remain a secret, however, and,
neither a sovereign nor possessed of effective physical prowess, and would seem to relate to the third function (cf. Littleton, The New Comparative Mythology,
p. 124).
239
Indo-European Themes in the Iliad
in what would appear to be an adumbration of their later embassy,
Odysseus and Diomedes trick the transvestite into joining the ex¬
pedition by leaving his armor in the women’s quarters. His exces¬
sive interest in these warlike appurtenances betrays his true sex, and
he eventually joins the fleet at Aulis.27
Unlike the other culpable heroes previously discussed, Achilles
does manage to redeem himself. He returns to the war bearing the
trifunctionally illustrated shield, overcomes Hector, and materially
advances the Achaean cause—which, as I have suggested, in essence
appears to be the cause of the first two functions. Yet Achilles, too,
is doomed; his invulnerability does not last indefinitely. Although his
death does not occur within the framework of the Iliad proper, it is
clear that it is imminent. In Book 18, for example, when Achilles
announces his decision to avenge Patroklos’ death, Thetis spoke to
him letting the tears fall: / ‘Then I must loose you soon, my child,
by what you are saying, / for since it is decreed your death must
come soon after Hector’s’ ” (18.94-96).28 Later on we learn from
Xanthos, Achilles’ chariot horse (whom Hera had given the power of
speech), that this “decree” had come from “ ‘a great god and power¬
ful Destiny’ ” (19.410), or, in other words, from the divine represen¬
tatives of the first function. That Achilles, like Herakles et al„ does eventually pay the supreme
price for his defiance of sovereign authority is congruent with what
appears to be a major aspect of the common Indo-European ideol¬
ogy: the ambivalent position of the warrior, especially vis-a-vis rep¬
resentatives of the first function. For he is at once vitally necessary
and a threat to the maintenance of the social order. Malinowski once
suggested that myths are fundamentally created to serve as prag¬
matic “charters” for behavior.29 If this dictum be correct, then in
the case of the Indo-European warrior the charter would appear to
reach be valorous in battle, but never forget that you are ultimately
subject to the authority of your sovereign, for if you do, you are
doomed. That such a charter is implied in the account of the “wrath”
of Achilles seems quite probable.
27 This episode has a number of counterparts elsewhere among the IndoEuropean traditions relating to second-function figures; cf., for example, the episode in the Mahdbharata, Book 4 (the Virataparuan), wherein Arjuna, posing as a eunuch, becomes a dancing master in the harem of King Virata. See Dumizil, Mythe et epopee (Paris, 1968), pp. 71-72. 28 This and other English translations of Homer are taken from Richmond Lattimore, The Iliad of Homer (Chicago, 1951). 29 b.

ligion (New York, 1955), p. 101.

The ambivalent character of the Indo-European warrior is also
expressed in a general tendency to separate mythical and epical
warriors into two distinct categories: the chivalrous and the bestial.
Perhaps the best attested examples of this dichotomy can be seen
in the Vedic differentiation between Indra and Vayu, and the subse¬
quent epic distinctions between Arjuna and Bhima. Arjuna, more
directly a transposition of Indra, exemplifies all that is noble and
chivalrous; Bhima, more immediately linked to Vayu, is boorish
and ill-tempered, and exhibits a savage bloodlust.
If we examine the several major figures of the Iliad, especially
the Achaean warriors, it is possible to see a number of examples of
this sort of differentiation, although none of them are as clear-cut
as the dichotomy between Arjuna and Bhima. The most obvious
candidate for the Bhima position, it seems to me, is the lesser (or
Locrian) Aias (Latin Ajax). Rose points out that this Aias is the
one hero for whom Homer shows personal dislike.31 And with good
reason, for unlike Achilles or his more chivalrous, if slow-witted,
namesake (Aias of Salamis), Aias of Locris is insolent, given to sudden
outbursts of violence, ill-mannered, and in general not a very pleas¬
ant figure. Perhaps his character is best summed up in Idomeneus’
words: “ ‘Aias, surpassing in abuse, yet stupid, in all else you are
the worst of the Argives with that stubborn mind of yours’ ” (23.483
484). Furthermore, Aias of Locris, like Vayu, is consistently described
as extremely swift of foot; this is a characteristic that seems to go
with warrior figures of the Vayu type, one that perhaps ultimately
reflects the idea of the “ill wind” that can cause sudden and violent
destruction. Aias of Salamis presents a different picture; although
slow-witted, he is nevertheless possessed of many Arjuna-like char¬
acter traits, among them loyalty, steadfastness, and a generally good
humor. Indeed, the distinction between the two Aiases does in many
respects parallel the Arjuna-Bhlma distinction, although admittedly
the greater Aias’ lack of sagacity does not conform to the Arjuna
model. Nevertheless, from this perspective, it is curious that two
warriors exhibiting in many respects opposite personality traits would
bear the same name. Perhaps we have here a dim reflection of a
common Indo-European warrior figure, possessed of a “Jekyll-and
Hyde” personality structure, who in the Indian tradition underwent
onomastic as well as characterological bifurcation.
In addition to the greater Aias, there are several other major
candidates for the Arjuna position. One, of course, is Achilles him
30 Dumezil, Aspects de la fonction guerriere. 31 H. J. Rose, A Handbook of Greek Mythology (New York, 1959), p. 236.
241
Indo-European Themes in the Iliad
self, despite his culpability-Indra, too, it must be remembered, was
culpable. It is Achilles who, after rejoining the army, bears the tri¬
functional shield in the climactic struggle with Hector. Moreover,
even at his most recalcitrant, Achilles is ever concerned with 11s
honor, and with assumed assaults upon that honor by Agamemnon
and others. Yet an equally good case can be made for Achilles as a
representative of the Vayu figure. In the first place, he is described
as the swiftest of all the Achaeans (see above); second, his behavior
is wrathful and capricious and in many respects resembles that of
Bhima. In short, Achilles’ character reflects both aspects of the Indo
European warrior figure, and it is impossible to assign him definitely
to one or another category. Another figure that should be mentioned in this connection is
Diomedes, who, with the possible exception of Hector, is perhaps
the most consistently honorable and chivalrous of Homers heroes.
Unlike Achilles, he is never given to fits of temper, never defies his
commander-in-chief, and in general can be counted upon for stead¬
fast and valiant service. Unlike the greater Aias, he is noted for his
good advice and quickwittedness. His loyalty to Agamemnon, who
on one occasion refers to him as “ ‘you who delight my heart
(10.234), is never in question. Perhaps these traits can best be seen
in Book 10, wherein Diomedes volunteers to lead a commando-like
expedition against the enemy. In short, in terms of personal character
traits, he is by far the closest Homeric approximation of Arjuna.
Yet Diomedes’ role in the Iliad hardly compares to that of Arjuna
in the Mahabharata, or to that of Indra in the Rig-Veda, and for
this reason alone I would hesitate to rank him as the Homeric Arjuna
figure. That a great many inherited Arjuna-like traits went into the
construction of his character cannot be doubted. Once again, we may
be confronted with a case of bifurcation, in this instance between
two facets of the Indo-European noble warrior: prominence in the
narrative (Achilles) and consistent chivalrous behavior (Diomedes).
Finally, there is Patroklos, intimate of Achilles, a figure generally
described’as honorable and chivalrous in his behavior. That he, too,
reflects some Arjuna-like traits seems probable; indeed, his close
association with Achilles-homosexuality is not uncommon among
second-function figures-may reflect the complimentary relationship
between the two aspects of the warrior. Yet Patroklos role in the
epic is even less prominent than that of Diomedes, a fact that cer¬
tainly must be kept in mind when considering candidates for the
honor of representing the noble Indo-European warrior.
In sum, there is no single candidate for this position. With the



C. Scott Littleton
242
exception, perhaps, of the lesser Aias, all of the figures just dis¬ cussed present some Arj una-like characteristics. The same thing, though to a lesser degree, can be said for the Bhima figure. That the theme of the bifurcation of the warrior is present seems undeniable; its manifestation, however, is apparently collective and not centered in a single pair of figures equivalent to Arjuna and Bhima or Indra
and Vayu. When it comes to candidates for first-function honors, the most obvious is Agamemnon, King of Argos, and commander-in-chief of the Achaean forces. The Argive king’s overall sovereign position is continually underscored by such epithets as “wide-ruling (1.102), “lord of men” (2.612), and “shepherd of the people” (19.35). Al¬ though he engages in battle, his prowess as a warrior is rarely empha¬ sized; rather, emphasis is continually placed upon his overlordship. In all this Agamemnon resembles Yudhisthira, eldest and leader of the Pandavas, whom Wikander has identified as a first-function figure. Yet problems arise when we attempt to make a more precise identi¬ fication, when we attempt to classify the Argive king as Varunaic or Mitraic. For it will be remembered that one of the coinei stones of Dumezil’s thesis is the idea of the joint or dual sovereignty, the idea that the Indo-European conception of sovereignty was divided into two complementary aspects; the cosmic and the juridical, personified in the Veda’s, respectively, by Varuna and Mitra.32 In the Iliad the evidence is by no means clear as to zuhich aspect of sovereignty Aga¬ memnon represents. Like Varuna, he is the ultimate sovereign; yet like Mitra, he is very much concerned with the affairs of men and serves (or attempts to serve) as an arbiter of disputes. On balance, however, I would suggest that he is more Varunaic than Mitraic. One reason for this suggestion is the curious impotence exhibited by Aga¬ memnon, especially in times of crisis. Although never abdicating his position as commander in chief, he is by no means decisive and must continually rely upon others to rally his spirits and to prop him up. That impotence—admittedly more physical than mental—is a Varun¬ aic characteristic was long ago pointed out by Dumezil.33 More re¬ cently, in following up Wikancler’s analysis of the first function in the Mahabharata, Dumezil has suggested that Pandu himself, “pale and impotent,” yet exercising ultimate sovereignty over his offspring, can be equated with Varuna, and that Yudhisthira, as an incarnation

Indo-European Themes in the Iliad
of the principle of Dharma, is more clearly linked to Mitra.84 If Agamemnon is Varunaic, who then might be suggested as the Mitraic representative of the first function? The most piomising set of candidates are those figures who most frequently serve as the Argive king’s props and counselors: Diomedes, Odysseus, Kalkhas, and Nestor. Diomedes can be ruled out by virtue of his previous¬ ly discussed second-function characteristics. Odysseus, though mani¬ festly a shrewd and sagacious counsellor, is too clearly a trickster figure; he presents too many parallels to Loki, Syrdon,35 et al, to be taken seriously as an incarnation of the juridical principle. When it comes to Kalkhas and Nestor, however, the matter becomes more complex. Both figures serve as counselors; both are renowned for their wisdom rather than for their fighting abilities. Yet the contrast between them would seem to reflect that typically found between representatives of the two halves of the function in question. Kalkhas is characterized principally as a seer, as a prophet whose counsel is rooted in a supernatural ability to divine; it is he, for example, who predicts the war’s duration and the role that Herakles arrows will play in its successful conclusion. This concern with prophetic insight, with things supernatural, would seem more Varunaic than Mitraic. In contrast, Nestor is the arbiter par excellence, the adjudicator (or would-be adjudicator) of disputes among mortals; one of his prin¬ cipal epithets is “fair spoken.” Rarely if ever does he have recourse to the kind of supernatural modus operandi employed by Kalkhas. On balance, he would appear to be much more concerned with the immediate affairs of the community than Kalkhas, and this, of course, is one of the distinguishing characteristics of the Mitra figure. Indeed, Kalkhas’ relationship to Agamemnon presents some broad parallels to the relationship, as expressed in the Rig-Veda (cf. Rig-Veda 10.72.3—5), between Varuna and Daksa (or perhaps Amsa; cf. RigVeda 10.31.3), wherein the latter is primarily concerned with ritual relationships and (in the case of AipSa) with the distribution of divine
fate. In short, although Kalkhas and Nestor present a great many gen¬ eralized first-function characteristics, I suggest that Nestor comes closest to meeting the requirements of a representative of the juridi¬
cal half of this function.36

These, then, are some possible Indo-European themes in the Iliad. If there be any validity to them, the trifunctional character of the illustrations upon the shield of Achilles, so convincingly demon¬ strated by Yoshida, is by no means an isolated survival of the com¬ mon Indo-European ideology in Greek epic. Rather, the presence of these themes would seem to indicate that the overall tradition rela¬
tive to the siege of Troy-or at least those aspects of it upon which Homer drew—was thoroughly infused with this ideology. To those who object to this conclusion on the grounds that the traditions suirounding the siege of Troy may well reflect an actual histoiical event, one may counter that it would not be the first time such an event has been subject to ideological reinterpretation. Gerschel, for ex¬ ample, has ably demonstrated that the Roman interpretations of the fall of Carthage, an undoubtedly historical event, were typically phrased in terms of the common Indo-European ideology37 to which the Carthaginians, as Semitic speakers, were most likely not
a party. If in fact the Trojan War did take place, it seems certain that those who took part in it were themselves the products of a tripartite social system. The Pylos tablets have yielded a picture of a society com¬ posed of three hierarchically ordered, functionally differentiated social strata: “On pourrait alors affirmer des a present que les Myceniens concevaient leur societe comme composee essentiellement
d’une classe sacerdotale (dont on ne connait pas encore le nom collectif), d’une classe guerriere le 'Ka.fos et d’une classe productrice le

introduce (or to complete) canonical lists of the representatives of the three func¬ tions; e.g., Dyauh, Janus, Heimdallr (cf. Dumezil, Tarpeia [Paris, 1947k PP- 97~ 100; see also “La tripartition indo-europC-enne,” Psyche 2:1348-1356 [1947]. where Dumezil terms the divinities in question T6pine du systeme’). Like Heimdallr et al„ Nestor belongs to an earlier generation; he is far and away the oldest of the major Achaean figures. Moreover, he is curiously removed from the sphere of action, serving typically as a mediator and counselor rather than as an active co¬ sovereign. Despite his advanced age he survives the war and continues to play an important part in subsequent events; even his name may be significant here, as it can be translated “The Returner, He Who Returns.” A case, too, can be made for a trifunctional character in that he is at once a counselor of the sovereign, is typically characterize^ as a horseman, and is described as the ruler of one of the wealthiest and most prosperous of the Achaean cities. Nevertheless, even if, as I suspect, Yoshida is correct in identifying these traits as appropriate to a "dieu premier,” this would not rule out a double identification as far as Nestor is con¬ cerned, for, as we have seen, a good case can also be made for assigning him to the role of juridical counterpart of Agamemnon. 37 L.

par le fkva^, le \5f5yer5s et le 65po/c6Xos, dont chacun etait attache
l l’un des trois ordres sociaux.”38 In the light of the evidence for the persistence of the Indo-European ideology in the structure of Mycenaean society, it is not unreasonable to assume that t is 1 eo
ogv persisted in other areas of Mycenaean culture, and that, as the much later Roman case just noted, it could have been brought to bear on the characterization of an event such as the defeat ot a
major commercial rival, that is, Troy. By Homer’s time, the tripartite character of Greek social organiza¬ tion, so clearly evidenced in the Pylos texts, had largely disappeared. This disappearance seems to have owed in large measure to the dis¬
ruptive effects of the Dorian invasions, the subsequent growth o Phoenician and other Near Eastern influences, and perhaps, as
Dumezil phrases it (see above), the beginnings of “le miracle grec. Yet the apparent absence of social tripartition does not in itself mean that the common ideology had wholly given way. It does not mean that this ideology had necessarily disappeared in the oral traditmns
relative to the exploits of Achilles, Hector, et al, upon which Homer must have drawn in the composition of the epic. Indeed, given ie generally conservative nature of oral traditions (the Rig-Veda and the Irish Lebor Gabala are excellent examples of such conservatism within the Indo-European domain), it is entirely possible that these traditions had managed to preserve more than a modicum of t eir original tripartite character. Thus, though not himself the product
of a tripartite society, Homer may very well have fallen heir to a body of tradition that took initial shape centuries earlier in a far more “Indo-European” social and intellectual context, that is, My¬
cenaean society, as revealed by the Mycenaean tablets. There are, of course, some purely philological and stylistic grounds for assuming a connection between the Iliad and other In o
European epic narratives, and these should be noted, if only 1 passing. For example, in Jaan Puhvel’s opinion there are very
sound philological reasons for deriving the Homeric hexameter fro Indo-European metrical sources.33 An interesting stylistic correspon¬
dence can be seen in the extent to which the typical Homeric enu¬ meration, which characteristically applies an epithet to the last item

In sum, although it is, as I have previously pointed out, impossible to deal adequately with a subject of this magnitude in a brief paper such as this, I do think that a strong case can be made for the IndoEuropean character of the Iliad and its principal characters and events. At the very least, the interpretations suggested here, coupled with those of Yoshida relative to the shield, would certainly seem to warrant a great deal more attention to possible Indo-European ideo¬ logical themes in Greek epic than has heretofore been given.
