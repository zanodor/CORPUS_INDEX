Itihāsa. K ̥rṣṇāvatāra ends, predicted by Gāndhāri's curse; exodus from Dwāraka, ca. 3102 BCE described in Mahābhārata
The calamity of tsunami is described in MBh --co-terminus with the realization of Gāndhāri's curse of the end of K ̥rṣṇāvatāra iss narrated by Vaishampayana.
The date of the event is close to the end of K ̥rṣṇāvatāra which is 3102 BCE, Kaliyugābda.
Vaishampayana said: “While the Vrishnis and the Andhakas were thus endeavouring (to avoid the impending calamity), the embodied form of Time (death) every day wandered about their houses. He looked like a man of terrible and fierce aspect. Of bald head, he was black and of tawny complexion. Sometimes he was seen by the Vrishnis as he peered into their houses. The mighty bowmen among the Vrishnis shot hundreds and thousands of shafts at him, but none of these succeeded in piercing him, for he was none else than the Destroyer of all creatures. Day by day strong winds blew, and many were the evil omens that arose, awful and foreboding the destruction of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas. The streets swarmed with rats and mice. Earthen pots showed cracks or broke from no apparent cause. At night, the rats and mice ate away the hair and nails of slumbering men. Sarikas chirped, sitting within the houses of the Vrishnis. The noise made by those birds ceased not for even a short while by day or by night. The Sarashas were heard to imitate the hooting of the owl, and goats imitated the cries, O Bharata, of jackals. Many birds appeared, impelled by Death, that were pale of complexion but that had legs red of hue. Pigeons were seen to always disport in the houses of the Vrishnis. Asses were born of kine, and elephants of mules. Cats were born of bitches, and mouse of the mongoose. The Vrishnis, committing sinful acts, were not seen to feel any shame. They showed disregard for Brahmanas and the Pitris and the deities, They insulted and humiliated their preceptors and seniors. Only Rama and Janardana acted differently. Wives deceived their husbands, and husbands deceived their wives. Fires, when ignited, cast their flames towards the left. Sometimes they threw out flames whose splendour was blue and red. The Sun, whether when rising or setting over the city, seemed to be surrounded by headless trunks of human form. In cook rooms, upon food that was clean and well-boiled, were seen, when it was served out for eating, innumerable worms of diverse kinds. When Brahmanas, receiving gifts, blessed the day or the hour (fixed for this or that undertaking) or when high-souled men were engaged in silent recitations, the heavy tread was heard of innumerable men running about, but no one could be seen to whom the sound of such tread could be ascribed.
The constellations were repeatedly seen to be struck by the planets. None amongst the Yadavas could, however, obtain a sight of the constellation of his birth. When the Panchajanya was blown in their houses, asses of dissonant and awful voice brayed aloud from every direction. “Beholding these signs that indicated the perverse course of Time, and seeing that the day of the new moon coincided with the thirteenth (and the fourteenth) lunation, Hrishikesa, summoning the Yadavas, said unto them these words: The fourteenth lunation has been made the fifteenth by Rahu once more. Such a day had happened at the time of the great battle of the Bharatas. It has once more appeared, it seems, for our destruction. “The slayer of Keshi, Janardana, thinking upon the omens that Time showed, understood that the thirty-sixth year had come, and that what Gandhari, burning with grief on account of the death of her sons, and deprived of all her kinsmen, had said was about to

transpire. The present is exactly similar to that time when Yudhishthira noted at such awful omens when the two armies had been arrayed in order of battle.
Vasudeva, having said so, endeavoured to bring about those occurrences which would make Gandharis words true. That chastiser of foes commanded the Vrishnis to make a pilgrimage to some sacred water. The messengers forthwith proclaimed at the command of Keshava that the Vrishnis should make a journey to the sea-coast for bathing in the sacred waters of the ocean.”
The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa (astrojyoti.com)
After Kr.s.n.a’s soul departs the mortal body--
वििृद्धमूषका रथ्या विविन्नमविकास तथा चीची कू चीवत िाश्यन्त्यः साररका िृष्णििेश्मसु नॊपशाम्यवत शब्दश च स वििारात्रम एि वि अनुकु िवन्न उलूकानाां सारसा विरुतां तथा अजाः वशिानाां च रुतम अन्वकु िवत िारत (MBh., Mausala, 2.5 to 2.7)
Streets swarmed with rats and mice, earthen pots showed cracks or were broken from no apparent cause, sarika_s chirped ceaselessly day and night, sa_ras hooted like owls, goats cried like jackals, pigeons departed from their homes, and asses brayed aloud in disconsonant and awful voices (Ganguly, 1998).
वनर्ावते तु जने तष्णिन सागरॊ मकरालर्ः ििारकाां रत्नसांपूिाां जलेनाप्लािर्त तिा (MBh., Mausala, 7.41) ति अि् िुतम अविेक्ष्यप्र ििारकािावसनॊ जनाः तूिावत तूिवतरां जुग्मर अिॊ िैिम इवत बरुिन (MBh., Mausala, 7.43)
The sea, the abode of monsters, engulfed the gem-filled Dwāraka with waves soon after the people departed the place. Seeing this astounding incident, the citizens of Dwāraka ran away, exclaiming, ‘O, our fate’. (Ganguly, 1998).
After the submergence of Dwāraka, Arjuna encamped in pañcanad region.
sa pañcanadam āsādya dhīmān atisamṛddhimat
deśe gopaśudhānyāḍhye nivāsam akarot prabhuḥ [Mahabharata: 16-8-43]
“Arrived at the country of the five waters, the puissant Dhananjaya planted a rich encampment in the midst of a land that abounded with corn and kine and other animals”.

This Vedic expression āyasipur is consistent with the description of Dwāraka in Puṟanāṉūru as a fortification with walls made of copper (metal).

If you ask who they are, they are his daughters, he who granted cities to those who came in need and earned great fame for gifting a chariot to the jasmine vine to climb, he who owned elephants with jingling bells, the lord of Parampu, the great king Pāri. They are my daughters now. As for me, I am their father’s friend, a Brahmin, a poet who has brought them here.
You are the best Vēlir of the Vēlir clan, with a heritage of forty nine generations of Vēlirs who gave without limits, who ruled Tuvarai with its long walls that seemed to be made of copper, the city that appeared in the sacrificial pit of a northern sage (Yaja). King who is victorious in battles!
Great king with garlanded elephants! Pulikatimāl with a bright garland who knows what a man’s responsibility is, and what you can do for bards!

I am offering them. Please accept them. Lord of the sky high mountain that yields gold! You whose strength cannot be equaled on the earth that is covered by an arched sky and surrounded by the ocean, you whose army puts fear into enemies with victorious spears! O ruler of a land that can never be ruined!
Irunkovel is supposed to be 49th generation of a king from (Tuvarai) Dwāraka. It can mean two things. Assuming about 50 years per generation, about 2500 years earlier Dwāraka which had walls made of copper. Dating the early phase of Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization to ca. 3500 BCE, and the submergence of Dwāraka to ca. 3100 BCE , which necessitated the movements of Sarasvati's children down the coastline to Kerala, this text places Sangam literature text of Puṟanāṉūru to ca. 400 BCE.
(Source: http://historum.com/asian-history/76340-satyaputras-earliest-indo-aryanizers-southindia-3.html) Migration from Tuvarai (Dwāraka) is attested in a 12th century inscription (Pudukottai State inscriptions, No. 120) cited by Avvai S. Turaicaami in Puranānuru, II (SISSW Publishing Soc., Madras, 1951). துவரைமாநைை்நின்ருளபாந்த
