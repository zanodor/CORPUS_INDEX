The Gandhara Connections project aims to make its activities accessible to the widest possible audience of researchers, students, and others interested in Gandharan art. To this end we intend as far as possible to provide live webcasting and podcasts of our events. This page will give advance information on live webcasts and it hosts recordings of our past events, many of which can also be found on the University of Oxford Podcasts page.
