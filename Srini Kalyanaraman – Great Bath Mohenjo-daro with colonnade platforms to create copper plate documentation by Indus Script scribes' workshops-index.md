Great Bath Mohenjo-daro with colonnade platforms to create copper plate documentation by Indus Script scribes' workshops
This monograph posits a thesis that colonnade platforms of the Great Bath were part of the metal products warehouse complex surrounding the Great Bath. These platforms would have been used to cool and clean the metal products during the documentation of the product details by the Indus Script scribes. Each platform of the colonnades would have held metal products of specific types as detailed in the decipherment of over 205 copper tablet inscriptions in three categories A,B,C.

Finds of large numbers of copper tablets in Mohenjo-daro from Great Bath area confirm use of nearby warehouses for products from copper ore smelters, furnaces.
The Great Bath is situated along a north-south street with a drain covered with limestone blocks. In the background is the so-called Granary, while in the foreground are the walls of several domestic structures. I suggest that these domestic structures were part of the bhāṭi karaṇa sāla 'furnace writers' workshops.'
This monograph rejects John Marshall's identification of Great Bath as a hydropathic establishment. "The Great Bath, which I have reserved to the last, was part of what appears to have been a vast hydropathic establishment and the most imposing of all the remains unearthed at Mohenjo-daro." (Marshall, Vol. I, p. 24).
I submit that Great Bath and the colonnades surrounding the vast area are part of the metal products warehouse complex and was used by scribes of bhāṭi karaṇa sāla 'furnace writers' workshops.'
The colonnades surrounding the Great Bath constitute platforms to hold the metal products and taken into the Great Bath reservoir for cooling and cleaning the metal products before the documentation is done on copper plates (205 copper plate inscriptions summarised and presented below, thanks to Asko Parpola).
Using Indus Script Corpora to re-evaluate form and functions of Ziggurat शिखर (stupa) temple,
college of priests and Sacred पुष्कररणी of Mohenjo-daro https://tinyurl.com/ujjchzb Ute Franke-Vogt has presented a balanced analytical framework to draw infernces from a review of 2927 objects from Mohenjo-daro with Indus Script inscriptions. In my view, the most significant inference is related to "overproportionally high concentration of copper tablets in the Great Bath and in Block C of the L area (p.149f.)" This indicates that Great Bath was associated with 'metalwork' which created the copper tablets. This indication confirms the analysis made in the two monographs cited that the Great Bath of Mohenjo-daro was associated with the



metallurgical processes with the drains out of the Great Bath used to carry away slag from copper ore smelters, furnaces, as surmised in:

I submit that the thesis of Ute Franke-Vogt confirms that finds of large numbers of copper tablets in Mohenjo-daro from Great Bath area; and that such finds confirm use of nearby copper ore smelters, furnaces. The drains out of the Great Bath were used to carry away slag from such furnaces used to work with inscribing on copper tablets.

On पोलाद pōlāda 'steel'
"Bulat is a type of steel alloy known in Russia from medieval times; regularly being mentioned in Russian legends as the material of choice for cold steel. The name булат is a Russian transliteration of the Persian word fulad, meaning steel. This type of steel was used by the armies of nomadic peoples. Bulat steel was the main type of steel used for swords in the armies of Genghis Khan, the great emperor of the Mongolian Empire. The technique used in making wootz steel has been lost for centuries and the bulat steel used today makes use of a more recently developed technique...Carbon steel consists of two components: pure iron, in the form of ferrite, and cementite or iron carbide, a compound of iron and carbon. Cementite is very hard and brittle; its hardness is about 640 by the Brinell hardness test, whereas ferrite is only 200. The amount of the carbon and the cooling regimen determine the crystalline and chemical composition of the final steel. In bulat, the slow cooling process allowed the cementite to precipitate as micro



particles in between ferrite crystals and arrange in random patterns. The color of the carbide is dark while steel is grey. This mixture is what leads to the famous patterning of Damascus steel.Cementite is essentially a ceramic, which accounts for the sharpness of the Damascus (and bulat) steel. " https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulat_steel "In the Muslim world of the 9th-12th centuries CE, the production of fuladh, a Persian word, has been described by Al-Kindi, Al-Biruni and Al-Tarsusi, from narm-ahanand shaburqan, two other Persian words representing iron products obtained by direct reduction of the ore. Ahan means iron. Narm-ahan is a soft iron and shaburqan a harder one or able to be quench-hardened. Old nails and horse-shoes were also used as base for fuladh preparation. It must be noticed that, according to Hammer- Purgstall, there was no Arab word for steel, which explain the use of Persian words. Fuladh prepared by melting in small crucibles can be considered as a steel in our modem classification, due to its properties (hardness, quench hardened ability, etc.). The word fuladh means "the purified" as explained by Al-Kindi. This word can be found as puladh, for instance in Chardin (1711 AD) who called this product; poulad jauherder, acier onde, which means "watering steel", a characteristic of what was called Damascene steel in Europe."
... ‘...’pulad’ of Central Asia. The oasis of Merv where crucible steel was also made by the medieval period lies in this region. The term ‘pulad’ appears in Avesta, the holy book of
Zoroastrianism and in a Manicheen text of Chinese Turkestan. There are many variations of this term ranging from the Persian ‘polad’, the Mongolian ‘bolat’ and ‘tchechene’, the Russian ‘bulat’, the Ukrainian and Armenian ‘potovat’, Turkish and Arab ‘fulad’, ‘farlad’ in Urdu and ‘phaulad’ in Hindi. It is this bewildering variety of descriptions that was used in the past that makes a study of this subject so challenging.’ (p.30)

This name derives from the Mongolian (Qalq-a ayalγu) “Bold”, from the Persian (Tājīk)
"pwlạd", meaning “steel”. Bolad († 1313), was a Mongol minister of the Yuan Dynasty, and later served in the Ilkhanate as the representative of the Great Khan of the Mongol Empire and cultural adviser to the Ilkhans. Geographical spread:
