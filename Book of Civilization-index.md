PREFACE
Thisprefaceisnotausualprefacetothisconcretebook.Morelikely,it is my free speculations on the theme of long time studies of chronology andproblemsof«ancient»historyingeneral.Infact,itisaprocessedand amendedtranscriptofmyprolongedtalkswiththeauthorsofthisbook. First,letmeexplainthereasonofmyinterestintheproblemofchronology. Ihavebeenseriouslyinspiredbyancient,medievalandnewhistorysince childhood.Ihavereadagreatnumberofhistoricalworksandbooks.Ihave goodmemory,Irememberwellmanyhistoricaldates,names,events.For many years I have created in my mind a full enough picture of history of «ancient» and medieval world in the way it is presented to us today. But besides, I like to analyze, figure out various opportunities, compare situations. And little by little, I have got a feeling that something is wrong with dates in ancient history. Here and there were discrepancies which cannot be solved within traditional history. One of the first problems that causedmyunconsciousconcernwastheimpossibilitytoplaceheroesof ancientGreekmythologywithinthetimescalethatembracesthesurmised periodoftheiractivities.MythicalTheseusslayingMinotaurtoliberateAthens fromhumiliatingtributetothepowerfulCretankingandthenunitingwhole Attica under his native town, his contemporaries assaulting the walls of Troy,allnumerousexploitsofthis«generationofheroes»embrace7-8(!) centuriesofancientGreekhistory.Ofcourse,mythsareanunreliablesource. Butshouldhistoricalchroniclesthathavebeenrewrittenmanytimes,that arerootedinthefolkloretraditionandtellabouteventshiddeninthedarkof centuries, be given this much credit? I understood it is important not to simply read books on history, but also to consider «historical evidence» relatedtousfromananalyticalpointifview,including,ifyouwish,fromthe pointofviewofacommonsense. About five years ago I came across several books written by mathematicians from Moscow State University A.T. Fomenko and G.V.Nossovsky.Itturnedoutthatagroupofprofessionalmathematicians headedbyacademicianA.T.Fomenkohadprofoundlydealtwithissuesof chronologyformorethantwentyyearsandachievedinterestingresultsin thisrespect.Thesebooksexplainedalottomeandputalotinitsplace. Thecriticalpartofthesebooksisquiteserious,itcontainshugevaluable material and deserves studying and discussing. At the same time, the hypothesesandreconstructionsputforwardbytheauthorsmaysometimes be argued. Obviously, it is extremely hard to give final reconstruction of

realhistoricalevents,andthispartofworkwillalwaysbesubjecttocriticism. But in the light of already published studies there is no denying that in chronologyof«ancient»historyacceptedtodaymostseriousdiscrepancies havebeenfoundwhichwecannotwaveaway. AndhereIwouldliketostatesomeofmythoughtsinthisrespect.
1.FALSIFICATIONOFHISTORYASPOLITICALWEAPONINTHE STRUGGLEFORPOWER.OPPORTUNITIESFORGLOBAL HISTORICALFALSIFICATIONSEVENINTHE20THCENTURY.
In order to maintain the whole concept of new chronology, I think it is importanttoproceedfromthefactthatsincetimeimmemorialfalsification ofhistory,asweknow,hasbeenthekeypoliticalweaponinthestrugglefor power.The20thcenturygivesusalotofillustrativeexamples. The most typical and known to all is what Stalin did with our history. Literally,in15yearswhilethelivingwitnessesoftheBolshevikcoup were there, he successfully revised history of the Bolshevik Party andtheCivilWar.FordecadestheStalinversionremainedofficialSoviet history.Andevennowtherearestillmanyzombie-likepeoplearoundwho continuetobelievethattheStalinhistoryoftheRevolutionandsubsequent events is the only true one. Thus, even the 20th century with its radio, telegraphanddiversifiedcommunicationscouldnotbutdoawaywiththe role of newly written history as a political weapon. Just think about the continuingdisputesaboutthearrestandliquidationofLaurentyBeria inJune1953.AndeveninnewestRussianhistorywecanseesomething of the kind. Let us take for example the events of 1993. One reads newspapersandunderstandsthatvariouspeoplegivevariousestimation of the same events. It means that in some time all this will be viewed by descendantsthroughtheprismofsomebody’spoliticalpredilections.And morelikelythatthevectorsumofthepicturetheywillgetwouldnotreflect the reality. It will depend mostly on who and for what purposes would be able to interpret today’s history in political struggle in Russia in, say, 50 years. It is quite evident that such opportunities also existed, conditionally speaking, in the 15th or even in the 17th centuries. With a much higher amplitude of information diversification it was simply impossible to verify andspecifyhistoricaldata.Thatiswhykings,tzars,khans,dukes,thatis peoplewhopossessedrealpowerandcontrolledprintinghouses,historians andchronologists,couldpracticallyfreelymanipulatewithdescriptionsof historicalevents,oreventswhichtheywantedtorepresentashistorical.It seems to me that this argument cannot be seriously refuted, and it is importantenoughtoavoidgroundlesscriticismthatitcannotbebecauseit can never be. Here we have «written history». It is written by someone. Thefirstthingwhichisdoubtedifthishistorywaslikethis.Weknowperfectly evenfromofficialchroniclesthattheMiddleAgeswerefulloffiercecourt

and political intrigues, fatal dynasty hostility. By the way, dynasty scuffle provides the best opportunities for falsification. In other words, all those royalgenealogicaltrees,allmillenniumdynastiescouldbecompiledtodirect ordersofmonarchswhoneededtoprovethathisfamilyhadalongancestry. Sowecaneasilyassumewithalmost100%probabilitythatpracticallyall mediaevaldynastyhistoryconsistedmainlyofreflectionsofsomemythical figures,veryoftenofthesameones,andservedtobackupthepowerofa monarch. We perceive such king’s pressure on his servants as another formofuncontrolledpowerabuse.
Thus,inordertoprovetherightsofHenryofNavarrefortheFrench throne, the provincial Bourbons had to be dated 250 years back«to find»initsremotestageacrossingwiththehouseofCapet-Valois!
2.DISCREPANCYINHUMANGENOTYPEINREALHISTORY ANDIN«PHANTOMCENTURIES»
Anotherevidenceinsupportofnewchronology,Ithink,isdiscrepancy in human genotype upon comparative analysis of various aspects of life activitiesinreal«checkable»historytowhichtheauthorsofthebookallot 600 years, and in «phantom» centuries. Comparing different stages of mankinddevelopment,wefindoutadramaticinconsistencyinwhatcanbe checked and actions or mankind development in those centuries that we arenotabletoverify. 1) BIOLOGICAL FACTOR. It is interesting to study the speed of multiplicationofmankind.Mostprobably,wehavedatawhichcanchecked. For instance, England from the 15th till 20th centuries when population grew from 4 to 62 million. Or France from the 17th till the 20th centuries startingfromthereignofLouisthe14th.Herethepopulationgrewfrom20 to60million.AndthiswaswhenFranceincontrasttoEnglandtookpartin atrocious wars. By official information, only during the Napoleon wars 3 millionpeopleperished.Andevidently,mostofthemwereflourishingmen. Thus,Francesufferedheavylossesinthesewarsandincontinuoussmall warsinthe19thcenturyandintheslaughterofWorldWarI. Itisquiteobviousthatnaturalmultiplicationwassloweddownbywiping outyoungpopulationtwiceduringtwohundredyears.Idonotsayanything aboutallthenightmaresoftheFrenchRevolutionandthewarsofthe18th centuries.Thus,weseetripleincreaseinpopulationin300years.InEngland itwasmuchhigher.Probably,duetoimmigrationfromformercolonies,but nevertheless,theincreasewasstillimpressiveenough.Englandisevena moreillustrativeexamplesinceitwasinalessdegreeaffectedbydreadful wars. The population of England, its genetic fund, did not suffer such destruction. So, we read in official history that it is 4 million in the 15th centuryand62millionnow.Itisa15-foldgrowthofpopulationin500years. SuchfactorsasjoiningofIrelandandScotlandarequitenullifiedbymass emigrationtotheNewWorld.

Naturallycomesaquestionwhatpopulationwasinthoseprovincesat thebreakdownoftheRomanEmpireinthe4th-5thcenturies?Atleast,the fertile Gallic provinces of the vast Empire were densely populated. If the EasternandWesternpartscombinedhadabout20millionpeople(minimal hypotheticalestimation),simplelogichintsthathordesofbarbariansinvading theEmpirealsocountedmillions. Therefore,ifforcountingwetrytouseregressivegeometricalprogression thenwegetanirrationalresult.Itturnsoutthatreproductionofpeoplein someperiodcompletelystoppedorsomewhere«anegativegrowth»started. Attemptsoflogicalexplanation,likeascribingthistoinadequatehygieneor epidemicscanhardlywithstandcriticism.Itisbecause,accordingtogeneral historical documents, there was no real improvement of sanitary life conditionsofpopulationinWesternEuropefromthe5thtillthe18thcenturies. Therewereepidemicsandhygienewaspoor.Besides,inthe15thcentury wars with firing arms started which took many more lives. It is more interesting to compare the population of ancient Oekumene in Pericles’ time(the5thcenturyBC)andEmperorTrajanus(the2ndcenturyA..D.).If wetakethenumberofresidentsinbigcitiesandpeopleinthearmy,wewill see enormous demographic growth. Of course, Greece under the rule of AthensisincomparabletotheworldempirewiththecenterinRomebutthe proportionsstillarenotkept.Justlookyourself,15,000freeAthenscitizens andRomeandAlexandriawithahalfmillionpopulation.Ontheonehand, there was a one and half thousand rear guard of the united army of the Greek city-states including 300 glorious Spartans staying to protect the retreatofthemainforcesinthewarwheretheveryexistenceofHellenes was put at stake. On the other hand, 26 legions (!) were maintained by Romeeveninpeacetimeandweredraftedwithoutintroducingobligatory generalconscription.ItismorethantheRussianEmpirecouldputto repeltheNapoleonaggressionin1812.Bytheway,andinthesecond PunicWar(2ndcenturyBC)afterthreeconsecutivetangibledefeatsform HannibaltheRomanssentan80thousandarmywhichwasalsocompletely crushed by the Carthagenians in the battle at Cannae which became a didacticone.Nevertheless,Romehadenoughreservestomakeaturn inalong-drawn-outwarwhichlastedforanother15yearsinthewhole area of the Mediterranean Sea.The scale of this military conflict is amazing, next time in world history several theaters of military operationsappearedintheAnglo-FrenchWarin1755-1763.
2)ANTHROPOLOGICALFACTOR.Letuslookatthedimensionsofa humanbeing.Wesee,forexample,picturesanddescriptionsof»ancient Greek « athletes. They run, jump, throw spears at some unbelievable distances.Inbattlestheyovercomeenemiesexceedingtheirnumber7or even10times.Andthenweseearmorsofmedievalknightswhichcouldfit only 15-year old youths in the 20th century. Medieval knight ammunition revealsquiteshabbyphysicalstrengthsofpeopleatthattime.Itlooksvery strange on the background of the imaginations of ancient powerful

athleticism. We have kind of a sine curve in the development of human muscles.Whywouldsuchachangehappen?AtthesametimeIadmita sine curve is a natural scheme for development of some class of living beingsbutnotfortwothousandyears.Qualitativechangesshouldtakeat leastdozensofthousandsofyears. 3)PSYCHOPHYSICALFACTOR.Andlet’sconsidersuchanimportant factorwhichIwouldconditionallycallapsychophysicalone.Inthepartof historythatcanbechecked,wefindoutabsolutelyunbelievablestriveof manfordiscoveries.Thevectoroftechnicalprogress,oflearningisdirected sharply and continuously upward. Literally, every 10 years something happens, something is discovered, they sail somewhere, something is exploded.Somethingconstantlychanges.FromColumbustomoonlanding, fromarbalesttoA-bomb,wecanseecontinuousdevelopment.Thereisno «hibernationforcenturies»observed.Onlyupwardandforward.Andatthe sametimeintraditionalancienthistorywefindthatpeoplesortoffallina many-centurysleep.Forinstance,«ancientEgypt»,«darkMiddleAges». Thereappearsomegigantictimezoneswhenthehumanthoughtallegedly faded.PeopleofancientEgyptorancientRomewouldturnouttohavehad quite a different genetic code. Nothing interested them. That is why they fellasleepforalongtime,asaresult,nothingwouldhappen.Althoughthe officiallyproposedancienthistoryofferedHomosapiensalotofopportunities for perfection. There were prosperous ancient empires in which people strivingforsciencesandculturehadmanyopportunitiesfor«selfrealization». But,alas,allprosperousancientempireshaltedatsomepointanddidnot developfurther.
3.TEMPOSOFTECHNICALANDCULTURALPROGRESS INANCIENTWORLD
Theycannotbeabsolutelyputwithintheframeworkofhumanabilities forpracticalperfection.Herearesomeexamples. 1)PRIMITIVISMOFMUSICALINSTRUMENTS.Theassortmentcould have expanded for more than one thousand years not limiting with only harp,cithara,reedandflute.Forexample,thereisnoevidenceofpercussion instruments. Violin is, of course, more complicated but it is not Newton’s binomial, either. For a thousand «ancient Greek» years they could have inventedsomething.IrealizethatStradivariuscouldbebornonlyinItaly. But,aswearesaid,therewasanancientcolossalperiodofflourishingof sciencesandartshalfacenturybeforethePeloponnesuswarunderPericles inAthens.Afterthatitwasapropitiousenoughandcalmperiodfromthe MacedoniantilltheRomanconquest.AndinRomeitwascalmforminimum 200 years. And strange as it may seem, it was silence. Rome adopts everythingformGreece,butnothinghappensinmusic.Althoughemperors, nobleandrichpeopleallegedlywasteawaymoney,hiresingers,musicians, poets,incitedevelopmentofarts.Butthereisnoimprovement.Everything

2)INABILITYTOIMPROVEARMSANDMILITARYTACTICS.Ifweare surprised with primitivity of Greek-Roman musical culture, we further on encounteranevenmoremysteriousparadox.Itisanamazinginabilityof «ancient»RomanrepublicandlateronfortheRomanEmpiretoimprove armsandmilitarytactics.Itisjustincredible!AtthedawnoftheRepublic Romancitizensformedeffectivemilitaryforces,thenthe«antic»Republic startedarmedexpansion.And,asweknow,theRomanEmpireisastate conductingregularoffensivewars. All this we learned from so called ancient sources. Expansion should incite the process of improvement of quality of arms and military theory. But centuries pass, but nothing drastically changes. Eventually, the Romanscouldnotstarttoforgesteel,thoughitisnotaninvention,it isjustthematteroftimeandpersistence.Workingpurposefullyone will need only several generations to successfully finish the experiments.Itwasextremelyimportanttoimprovethequalityofarmson which legionaries’ lives depended and which in general could effect the character of military actions. And we are assured that during their long history the Romans allegedly fought with short swords made out of low qualityiron. Cavalry. If we believe «antic» sources, the Roman cavalry was not a serious force. One of the reasons was that there was no harness! Probably,therewerealreadyreins,buttherewerenostirrups.Stirrups appearedonlyinthe8thcenturyaccordingtothetraditionaldatingof officialhistory.AllegedlystirrupscamefromChina.Andinthe8thcentury AD together with stirrups chivalry came. It all coincides — stirrups and immediatelychivalry.Anditisrightandunderstandable.ButancientRomans did not pay attention to harness at all. But the most dangerous battles in historyofRomewerewithorientalpeople,skillfulhorseriders.Withmythical Parthians who disappeared all of a sudden. By the way, there was the Parthiankingdomandthen...disappeared.Andthoseorientalpeoplehad twoimportantadvantages,i.e.cavalryarchersthatinflictedheavycasualties ontheRomans.Arrowsofheavylongbowssmashedtheinfantry,knocked itdowninrows.ButRomedidmakeanyattemptstoimproveshooting arms. Ancient Rome did not have arbalests either. Although, the Romans, masters of ballistics, could have easily invented powerful enough shooting devices which could be operated by one person, like arbalests and long bows. Nevertheless, it did not happen, and in reality the quality of military actions of the Roman army did not change. Thereisonemorediscrepancy.NumerousheroesofancientGreekmyths were splendid archers. Even powerful Hercules had to use arrows many



11
times.ThebowofOdysseuspossessingincrediblekillingpowerslewunlucky bridegroomsofPenelope.AndsomanygiantswerekilledbybrilliantApollo withhiswell-aimedbow! There are two well-known occasions of crushing defeats of Roman legions.ThefirstisthefalloftheCrassusarmyatCarrhaein53BCThe secondoneisAdrianople,thedefeatofthearmyofEmperorValensin378 ADThetimeperiodbetweenthefirstandthesecondisallegedly400years! Butbothdefeatsarepracticallyidentical.Inbothcasesheavycavalryand archers just smash the Romans. The legions cannot maintain battle formation, the Roman cavalry gets stuck somewhere. The foes break up the formation and start to pursue the shocked crowd of warriors. The descriptionsofbothbattlesarealmostalike.Bytheway,theytookplacein Asia Minor close to each other. In accordance with the proposed new chronology,itismorelikelythatthetwomiragesjustlieoneachother.In reality, a western army was once in ancient time completely defeated becauseitcouldnotwithstandwell-aimedarrowsandheavycavalrycutting theformationapart.Quiteprobably,itwasoneofthebattlesofamedieval Trojanwar. ItisinterestingnowtolookatallglorioushistoryofRomanvictoriesfrom anotherpointofview.ItisalsostrangewhytheenemiesofRomedidnot adoptanythingfromtheRomansforalongtime.And,say,kingMithridate, withwhotheyhadlongwars,hadenoughwitandmeanstoworkouteffective countermeasures. In reality, the Romans did not show anything but legionaries’ drill and high military discipline. Nevertheless, there are 400 yearsbetweenthesementionedbattlesatCarrhaeandAdrianople,andin allthoseyearstheRomansallegedlydidnotsufferseriousdefeatsexcept thefallofthelegionsofQuintiliusVarusinthebattleagainsttheGerman barbariansintheTeutoburgForest. Theprogressininventionofnewmeansofdestructionofhumanbeings startsonlyinthe14th-15thcenturies.Andithasneverstoppedsincethen.

Officialhistorygivesquiteabizarrepresentationofthedevelopmentof heavyweapons.Fromthe8thtillthe14thcenturiestherewasonlyminimal improvementofknighttroops.Theirnumbersareextremelylimited,regular armies are very small. The reason was that arms and ammunition were extremelyexpensive.Afullyequippedknightwasanenormousforce.And intheepochofgloriouskingRichardLion’sHeartadetachmentofseveral hundreds of well armed knights could disperse a whole non-professional army. This fact tells something about a number of people and that the mankind was mostly poorly prepared. Evidently, it did not have such rich historybehinditselfyet.

French troops because the French have new small mobile cannons which can literally crush in pieces high walls of old forts. And immediately engineers minds start to work rashly, and in the 16th centurythereappearfortifiedconstructionsthatcansharplyreduce the crushing power of artillery. And after that everything develops quicklywithintheframeworkoftheclassicaltheory«missile—armor».
4.DISCREPANCYBETWEENTASKSOFGIGANTICSTATE BUILDINGINANCIENTTIMESANDMEANSOFTHEIR FULFILLMENT
Ialsoseemstomethatthereisanobviousdiscrepancybetweentasks of«ancient’giganticstatebuildingandmethodsoftheirfulfillmentdescribed inthe«antichistoricaldocuments». 1) ABSENCE OF GEOGRAPHICAL MAPS. The Roman Empire was famous,anditcanbeconfirmedbyeverymoreorlesseducatedperson, for diversified network of roads and communications. It is impossible to imaginethatthoseroadsexistedwithoutnumerousgeographicalmaps.Of course,thereweremaps,otherwiseonecannotimaginethoroughplanning ofRomanmilitarycampaigns.Scientificprinciplesofmappingwereproposed by«agreatgeographerandastronomerofancienttimes»ClaudiusPtolemy. Butatthattimeitwashardtoexplainthecauseofstrangedisappearance ofthatepoch’smaps.Simpleexplanationbybarbariandestructioncannot beacceptedbycommonsensebecauseanynotordinarychiefs,andwe mustplacemythicalAlaricandAttilaamongthem,wouldquicklyevaluate thequalityofthisproduct.Romanmapswouldbeguardedliketheappleof an eye, as they gave its possessor a great advantage in the fight with numerousenemies.Reactionarymedievalchurchdidnotseemtoinclude descriptivegeography(nottouchinguponthepointoftheformoftheearth globe)andtopographyintothelistofhereticsciences.Thenhowcanwe explainwidecirculationinthe6th-14thcenturiesofilliteratecoarsely paintedpicturesproudlycalledmaps?HowcouldwesternEuropean crusadersreachJerusalemwithsuchinformativemeans?
2)ABSENCEOFBANKINGSYSTEMANDGOODSCREDIT.«Ancient» documentskeepcompletesilenceaboutbankingsystemandgoodscredit inthe«ancient»RomanEmpire.Ithinkthatorderlylifeofanempireimplies prosperityoftrade.AndtradeintheRomanEmpireespeciallyinthesize we are told about needs in existence of credit institutions.

5.UNLUCKYDESTINYOFFUNDAMENTALSCIENCE INANCIENTWORLD
1)ABSENCEOFGREATSCHOLARSSINCETHEFIRSTCENTURY BCFromtraditionalhistoryweknowmuchaboutscholarsofancientGreece. Even too much. The life of Aristotle merely from the first till the last day. Socrates,amythicalfigure,asmanyscientistsbelieve,leftadetailedlife description. We know all the dialogues of Plato with his pupils. And we know about Archimedes, about Heraclitus, we have some pieces of information about mythical Pythagoras. Look anywhere, there is always someinformation...AndweheardaboutAristarchusofSamos,anancient precursor of Copernicus, about his expulsion for his heretic theories. We studiedthoroughlyaboutEuclid.Andallofsudden—agap!Sinceabout the first century BC there has been a gap. There are no more scholars! Scholars disappear. Of course, there are historians, geographers and philosophers,butdevelopmentoffundamentalsciencescompletelystopped! We know well that in the Roman Empire there was a period when a whole dynasty patronizing sciences ruled. In the first, there was Adrian who,trulyspeaking,preferredmonumentalconstruction.Butafterthatthere was well-educated Antoninus and then, at last, Marcus Aurelius, a philosopher emperor, patron of sciences. It was a Golden Age by all parameters!Insuchtimegeniusesenjoyalotoffreedom.Justlookatthe reinofElizabethandCatherinetheSecond,andhereisgreatprosperity! Lomonosovs keep coming from common people. But nothing of the kind takesplacein«ancientRome».Empireisalmostendless,coversthewhole ancient world, the most talented peoples. But there is voidness in real science. As the main value, we have «carefully» preserved science like compilationsofthefirstChristiantheologianswhotriedtoadaptnewreligion topoliticalandculturalrealitiesoftheRomanEmpire. 2)ABSENCEOFGOODCOUNTINGSYSTEM.Oneneglectsthefact thattheromancountingsystemdoesnotsuitanyseriouscalculations.Just trytodividebignumbersinacolumnorfigureoutthevolumeofacomplicated geometricalfigure.Andwhataboutthetheoryofcontinuousfractions?But nevertheless, the «ancient» Romans did some calculations, even complicatedones.Largescalearchitecturalprojects,engineering,ballistics —allthisrequiredthemostprecisecalculation.Itishardlypossibletobuild acathedral,bridgeortotakeafortresswithoutaccuratecalculations.Itis absolutely inconvenient to use clumsy Roman numbers in multistage astronomical calculations. Then it is just time to wonder what counting systemfamousGreekscholarsused?Say,Archimedes,AristarchofSamos, Euclid,Ptolemy.Theyreallyneededaperfectmodelforcalculations.Butif theyhadsuchasystemofcountingthenwhypragmaticRomanswho had adopted the best from the Greeks ignored this cornerstone of anyscience?TheonlylogicalexplanationisthattheGreeksdidnot havesuchasystem.Really,atticandionicsystemsofcounting«recorded»

inofficialhistorywereevenmoreclumsythantheRomanone.Buthowdid thentheycount?Itisnotasecretthatall«antic»scienceissurprisinglywell associatedwith«Arabic»medievalcounting.Thelatterappeared,according toofficialhistoryonlyin10centuriesafterfundamentalworksof«ancient Greek» founders of mathematics and physics. Here is an incredible time gap!Andduringthistimeperiodinspiteofdisappearanceofallscientific traditions,«ancient»manuscriptswereconstantlyrenewed.Althoughthe purposeofwasnotclear,ifonetakesintoconsiderationthatthesubjectof descriptiondidnotexistinrealworld.Andwheredidmonkscientistscome from who were able to make out complicated formulas without special training? In fact, in all those copies of the above mentioned works to which we canhaveaccesscommon«Arabic»numbers,thatweareaccustomedto, are used. At the beginning of the book printing epoch surprising «carelessness»ofpublishersdidnotpreservefordescendantsexamples ofmathematicequilibristicexercisesof«greatmindsofancienttime»who wereabletosolvehardestproblemsonlywiththehelpofletterimages! 3)ABSENCEOFCHEMICALINVESTIGATIONS.Nothingisheardabout anychemicalinvestigationsinancientworldeither.Therewerenochemists, noalchemists.IwonderwhyalchemistsappearedonlyintheMiddleAges? Theveryideaoftransformationofkindsofmatterdatesbacktothebeginning ofthephilosophicalthought.AncientGreekphilosophers,evidently,believed that transition from one substance state into another was the major phenomenon in nature and tried to prove all this theoretically. But for no reasontheydidnotmakeanyspecificpracticalsteps.Thereneverappeared «ancientGreek»chemistry. WereadalotaboutGreekfirethatwasasinisterweaponoftheByzantine army in the early Middle Ages. And hardly it was just crude oil for in this caseByzantiumwouldnotbeabletoholdamonopolyonsuchaneffective militarymeans.Mostprobably,chroniclesdescribedsomecomplexchemical substance which implies some kind of knowledge in this field. But we do notknowanythingaboutchemicalstudiesinmedievalByzantium. 4) ABSENCE OF GOOD MEDICINE. We will say a few words about anatomy and medicine. The works of Hippocrates did not come to us as wellas,bytheway,worksofothergooddoctors.Itisquitestrangebecause emperorsandkingsneededmedicinenotlessthanimprovementofmilitary cause. All conditions for that seemed to be there in the «ancient world». Butfornoreasonatall,nopracticalstepsweremadeinthisdirection.As wellaschemistry,medicineandanatomyappearedagain«suddenly»only in the Middle Ages. I think it is strange that Homer’s poems and other masterpieces of «antic» literature survived better in the gloomy epoch of theMiddleAgesthanvaluabletreatisesonhealingofahumanbody.Though, skillfuldoctorswouldbeusefulforbarbariankingsnotlessthanforeducated Romanemperors.

5)POORDEVELOPMENTOFSOMEOTHERACTIVITIES.Bytheway, all the thoughts associated with science and development of culture are alsoappliedtoothersocalledancientcivilizations:Egypt,Babylon,China. Hereprogressalsoreachessomelevelandthenwithoutanyrealreasons everything halts and dies. And, as the authors of this book convincingly proveit,therearenomaterialconfirmationof«ancientprosperity».Except, of course, those in which we are ready to believe without requiring any further explanations. It is very important to point out the fact that all technical and cultural achievements of the «Ancient World» are surprisingly correlated with the level of development of European civilizationbythemomentofthefirstprintedpublicationsofworksof «antic»authors.Inquisitivemindofthe«antic»geniuscouldnotinvent anythingfor10centuriesthatwouldhavesupersededachievements ofEuropeanswho,asweknow,hadmaximum300yearsofprogress ofRenaissancebehindthem!Inthelightofthisitwouldnotbetooboldto putforwardanassumption,stayingwithintheframesofsoundhumanlogic, thatmedievalauthorswroteall«antic»historyinthe15th-16thcenturies. And what they did was a mere projection of their medieval world into the past.Theytookeverydayenvironmentoftheirtimeandextrapolateditto «ancientGreece»and«ancientRome».Andthentheyaddednotqualitative changes — they did not have Julius Verne’s imagination — but purely quantitativechanges.Thelifeof«antic»worldcreatedbyimaginationwas embellishedbythat«ancientpeoplehadmoreofeverything».Butnaturally, therewerenoinnovationsinarms,science,everydaylife.Itlookslikethat no one cared that , by official history, the 15-16th centuries were on the samelevelofdevelopmentastheRomanEmpireintheperiodofitshighest power.Although,«theancientempire»inthetimeofprosperitycouldhave createdtheelementarythingswetalkedabout. Nowlookcarefullyatbiographiesofoutstandingpeopleofthe«ancient world». Bright details turn these «biographies» into works of literature. Amazingistheprecisionwithwhich«anticauthors»restoreminuteepisodes fromlivesoftheircharacters.ThebitterremarkofAlexanderofMacedonto Parmenion during the discussion of peace proposals of king Darius, the instructions of Caesar to his legates before the battle of Pharsalus, the words of Julian the Apostate before his death, all these most valuable evidencesweremostprobablyimmediatelywrittendownbythewitnesses, andreachedthebiographersintheunchangedformhavingpassedfrom handstohandswithreverenttrepidation.Totellthetruth,ithappenedthat different sources contradicted one another, but the «true» picture of the event was always reconstructed, and apocrypha was thrown into the dumping ground of history. Unfortunately, modern biographers have completelylostthe«ancient»artofintuitivecomparativeanalyses.Andin spiteofobviousimprovementofcommunicationmeansvoluntaryinformers did not perform effectively at all. Besides, characters of newest history themselvesfailtospeaksharpaphorismsincriticalmoments.Wehaveto

dowiththefactthatinbiographiesofmostfamouspersonalitiesthereare blank spaces, many important periods of their lives are poorly described because of absence of ample true evidence. Naturally, major historical events of the last 300 years are freely interpreted depending upon the sourcesavailabletoorselectedbytheauthor.The14thofJuly1789or the 14th of December 1825 lack crystal precision of facts in their endless descriptions which are characteristic of the story about Catiline’s conspiracy and its suppression that is preserved for the convenience of study in only one version. Bookshelves full of motley historicalanalyticalliteratureshouldnotmisleadanyonesince99%ofthese books were written in the last 150 years and mainly amend and develop condenseddescriptionoftheoriginal.Someonehavingthoroughlyanalyzed the«ancient»textputsforwardanewhypothesisnaturallystayingwithin the traditional chronology. Later on, this hypothesis undergoes multiple discussionswhichresultsinopeningofanewendlessfieldofstudies.That iswhyweshouldbeawarethattheimagesoffamous«antic»commanders, politicians, philosophers, we have formed in our imagination, have been seriouslyadjustedbyeverynewgenerationofhistorians.Atthesametime the starting database, even considering new archeological excavations, remainedpracticallyunchanged.Mostofthe«storiesofthefarawaypast» are based upon one specific source, one author whose works are unconditionally believed in and serve a starting point for all following amendments.Thus,thecreationoftheGreatPersianEmpireofAhemenids is mentioned for the first time in Herodotus’ «History». The history of the PunicWarsalongsidewiththeinformationaboutCarthagewasfirstlyrelated byPolybius.Alas,thesourceshereferstodidnotlivetillthebookprinting time. By the way, this productive author was very unlucky. Out of 40 (!) books of his «World History» only 5 (!) were fully preserved that made futurerestorersofhistorythinkupmanydetailsofHannibal’scampaigns.I need to point out that unique preserved evidence was always presentedbythesidethatwoninthemilitaryconflict.Itfirstofallby allmeanseliminatedanymentioningaboutthelosers(burningofSusa, demolition of Carthage and Jerusalem) and then formed an official pointofview.Suchinterpretationsshouldnotbegivenconfidenceevenin traditionalhistoricalconceptmaking. 6)PAUCITYOFLIFECONDITIONSANDDEVICES.Everydaylifeof theRomanEmpireisdescribedinfairlygreatdetail.Butletushavealook at the household environment of the ruling elite.

Youwillnotbemistakeninsupposingthatmanyofthequestionsputby me have already been noticed by historians and philosophers. However, all similar discussions boiled down in the long run to attempts to explain, sometimesquiteclumsily,dubiousmomentsanddiscrepanciesintraditional historicalinterpretations.Thus,inhisfamousbook«TheSunsetofEurope» outstanding German philosopher of the 20th century Oswald Spengler dedicatedthewholechapter«OntheMeaningofNumbers»toprovingthat ancientmathematicianswereabletosolvethemostcomplicatedproblems without corresponding digital symbols. Dozens of pages of heavy speculationsarededicatedtoshowingspecialessenceofanticmathematics that was, as Spengler, stated, the highest form of harmony of the ruling world perception of that time. Mathematics of ancient Egypt or ancient Greece forcefully taken out of the system, where it was created, would inevitablylosecomprehension.Thatiswhyunderstandingofthesamethings cametomodernscholarsandtheirfarpredecessorsinprincipallydifferent ways.Iquote,«Wouldmathematicsbejustascienceasastronomyor mineralogy(!—G.K.),itssubjectcouldnotbedefined...Nomatterhow forcefully we, Western Europeans, would apply our notion of number to whatmathematiciansinAthensandBaghdaddealtwith,thereisnodoubt that the theme, purpose and method of the science with the same name wereabsolutelydifferentthere»or«They(Eudok,Apollonius,Archimedes — G.K.) use profoundly thought over and hardly comprehensible to us methodsofintegralcalculus(!—G.K.)whichhaveonlyaseemingsimilarity tothemethodofdefiniteintegralofLeibniz...»Andfurtheroninthesame way.InthemostcomplicateplacesSpenglerappealedtosacralandmystical sense ascribed to numbers in ancient time, thus moving the problem to irrational sphere of comprehension. It is clear that such metaphysical alchemistry makes absolutely senseless the issue in what system of calculationtheoreticalandappliedtasksoftheancientscienceweresolved. Tobelieveornottobelieveinapossibilityofconstructingmagnificent memorials of «ancient time» proceeding from «general thinking», without making mathematical calculations checked many times, depends, to my mind, upon the ability to overcome deeply rooted prejudices.

INTRODUCTION
G.K.Chesterton wrote a story about a terrible «ancient» book with the
words on the title page:
They who looked into this book Them the Flying Terror took.
However when the non-superstitious Father Brown did look into that
repelling everybody book he discovered that all the pages there were
empty... (G.K.Chesterton. The blast of the Book).
Similarly, when a child yet free from superstition opens the Book of Life
he discovers there only empty pages. And the main question of civilization
for the first time occurs to him: WHY?
The parents answer his endless questions «why» as much as they can.
And if they can’t they answer: «God knows why...» And they pass the child
to the knowledgeable men and women who keep clever faces explaining
the child WHAT, WHERE, and WHEN not the last point to force him to stop
annoying them with his «why?».
And in most cases they succeed in interrupting his questioning by means
of learning by heart a sentence: «Quod licet Jovi, Non licet Bovi» Or: «What
is allowed to Jupiter Is not allowed to the bull»
And this is drastically different to the parent’s helpless: «God knows
why...» Instead this is an imperative: «God is allowed, and you, cattle, are
notB!u»t this is tricky because who is entitled to allow or not to allow something
to God?
AstoGodheisabsolutelyuninterestedinthehuman«WHAT,WHEN,
andWHEREbecauseHereallyknows.
God gives to the human beings a chance to find out WHY through man
made and fairy miracles by means of another amazing but close-to Earth
question: «HOW?»
The Civilization Book is primarily a book about the ways and methods
used by the ancient people for manufacturing the working tools, households,
traps for fish and animals, rafts and boats, sleds, sweep buck-rake chariots,
cult buildings, pyramids and sacred barrows, stone monuments and
dolmens, fishing rods, saddles, stirrups, horse shoes, necklaces and other
decorations.
Such book can be titled: «Anthology of the Human Technologies».
A special technology has been invented for drafting the «Anthology».
This is scanning of CATALOGUES and EXPOSITION OF NUMEROUS
MUSEUMS while constantly asking a question: «HOW WAS THIS DONE?»
The question «HOW?» among many other questions concerns the
TECNOLOGY, METHODS OF PRODUCING of something.
Thus Jorge Angel Livrada Rizzi tried to help us all not to be tempted by
the fashionable versions of explanation of historic events but to look for the
verity by ourselves.
This book has been written not for the historians-book worms who are



24
rigid and are unable to change their minds, even if they witness Him walking
across the waters as on the solid ground. It is of no use to argue with the
leaders of historical branches. They are the keepers of the dogma.
But still there exists a hope to persuade the authors of the school manuals
and encyclopaedia for children, film producers, authors of the popular
science and fiction books, school teachers and students and common
readers who are not indifferent to change their minds. To explain those
facts which can be explained. Notwithstanding the dogmas and the
banalities.
To bring the mass reader the substance of a scientific discovery or a
discussion is far not easy. It is easy to say: «exact and exciting» but who is
able to do this? By a unique chance one of a hundred of the professors
canD.ry orthodox science was well described by V.V.Rosanov in 1901:
Science is an exact and necessary fact», they say. But another part of
the scientists, not the worse one, which requires some poetry from the science,
does not avoid questions from pure curiosity and uses the methods of
imagination,thinkingandconjecture.This part of scientists in the whole mass
works as ferment or yeast. The science would get sour if these fungi did not
push by their imagination the mass of old opinions and facts, always tending
to drop down to the bottom and quietly stay there forever
(V.V.Rosanov.Atthepagans’courtM.Republic,1999,p.197)
Within the expired century thick layers of non-required information
dropped down to the bottom of the scientific storage rooms, while annoying
banalities are floating on the surface. Terrible «scientific» schools have
politicized the scientists, choosing some of them from the seas of similarities,
awarding them and giving them the right to value the intellect of the others.
It is fashionable to speak about search for the new on the border line
between the traditional sciences, however the interest of mathematicians
or geologists for history or philology is not encouraged. But no distinct border
lines have ever existed between the sciences. Just the verification of the
achievements in one branch of the science by the methods of another branch
is important for the science.
Some irony and humor would be quite useful here. It is funny to watch
the snobbery of the scientific sectarians however they can not be cured.
How many new Academies have appeared in Russia, how many new
academicians have surfaced! Evident distortions in self-evaluations. But
this is temporary. The humanity, smiling, will reject this nonsense. The need
of knowledge rather than that of making an impression will come back again.
«Shrimad Bhavagatam» points that: Thenecessaryofreadingisabasic
naturalneedofahumanbeingfromthebirth.Butthisinclinationtoreading
isexploitedbytheauthorsofnegligibleworks.»
It is time to start, however. The grandchildren are our hope: God
permitting, they will read this book and, possibly, will re-read and criticize
and will not follow the idol.
But they may ask of what and how the other idols have been created.
The scepticism of the experienced co-fellows of the author is often not the
substitute of wisdom but instinctive defense of the de-trained mind from the
external information’ influence. To believe immediately is not common in
the mature age. But note:themindofachildconsumeseverything!It trains



25
itself, applies a fairy tale to the reality, compares himself and the World. It
escapes from the reality into dream, imagination, into absent-mindedness.
Watching the crows during the school hours. Into INTERNET if possible.
Into spontaneous creativity. Into cheating and cowardness as a reaction to
the aggression and tyranny of the adults. God sake, not to the distorted
space of lawless existence...
An anonymous author of the book, wonderfully published in Russian:
«Last days of the life on Earth of our Lord Jesus Christ, as described by all
four Evangelists» ( Odessa,1857) quietly talks in the foreword:
This, which is being offered to the attention of a Christian reader, was
writtennotyesterdayneitherthedaybeforeyesterdaybut30yearsbefore
thistime...»Andthehopeisfurtherexpressedthereinthathisbook:«willbe
metnow inthesamewayasifitwouldhavebeenmetatthetimeofitsbirth
30 years before.» And again: «The fate of the old, newly published now,
work will usefully reflect the property of the modern times themselves
comparedtothosetheywere within30years».
We bow down before the author’s patience. For 30 years he was waiting
for the authorization of the censorial department. And, thanks God, he had
gotItit!is hard to trail the pass. A man can do only that permitted by the
modern technologies. In a famous museum awax head24 cm high related
to the 3d century was long on display. Some day someone curious analyzed
the material. It turned out to be paraffin!
Or on the bottom of the Galilean See a wooden plank boat was found in
which Christhad once floated. The planks are produced of acacia, durable
with curly fibres.
Say, messieurs archaeologists, by what method were the planks made?
And what a saw-mill could there be 2000 years ago?
Or how the long planks of the boat of Pharaoh Khufu were made? Made
of a very strong wood like cedar, sycamore etc.
Everyone knows about the iron rosette of the Etruscans made,
supposedly, in the 7th century BC. The principles of symmetry are well
suitable there to learn them now! The ancient Etruscans knew geometry 4
centuries before Euclid! That is!
And so the talk goes on.
The hope emerges.
The hope is fuelled by support and sympathy of friends, comrades,
supporters and fans.
Implantation of a new paradigm into even vivid minds is close to the
replacement of organ to the live subject — repellingis possible.
It is clear that the imprinting — the first appreciation of the life surrounding
is very difficult to overcome. The just hatched chicken takes the first moving
object for its mother. Do not try to persuade it in a different way!
The same with the human learning process. Taken earlier is more truthful.
V.V. Rosanov in 1899 put this in such words:
Weourselvesdecisivelycannotordonotwanttocomplicateourselves andnootherspiritexistsinusthanthespiritofstagnation.«Nohabits!»
Ok, we’ll do. No other way out.



26
Information wars existed ever.
Always the rulers drove their subordinates, a word was forcefully
implanted into the minds and stayed there for long.
AimsandRestrictionsmade a corridor within life time of the generations.
The leaders were showing the way, the subordinates were going. And the
blindleadingblinds is not simply a satiric imagination. Fine art, sculpture
are powerful means of influence on a human being. And, certainly,
literature...
Including the historic one.
But it is well appreciated that the people are not satisfied by their position
on Earth, they are ready for promotion, wealth, they are ready to go overseas,
but, still, they are very conservative in their historic views.
Another sad tradition is — conformism. Where is that naive boy — non
conformist who claimed what he actually saw, oppositetoeveryone: «The
Kingisnaked!»
D. Bruno, Galileo, I.Newton, A. Einstein were great because they were
non-conformists. And A.T.Fomenko is a non-conformist too.
And any first discoverer, pioneer, is a non-conformist. Godknowswhy...
A.Zhabinsky, the author of « Another history of Art», art scientist rather
than a tecnologian, clearly sees historical contradictions in the works of
official historians. He is a brave man!
«The history of Technology» published by the Institute of History of natural
sciences and Technologies suggests without hesitation:
«Iron was known in China already in 2357 BC, and in Egypt in 2800 BC»
How exact! Not 2360 or 2350 but just 2357!
And further: « The Iron Age in Europe began approximately before 1000
years BC.»
The precision in the opposite direction...
And more:
Thefirstmodernizedartificialair-blowingdevice(foraccelerationcopper
melting)appearedinEgyptabout1580BC.Theweltingironmethodsand
thesurfacehardeningevidentlywereappliedinArmeniain1400BC.
Funny scientists are in that Institute.
Dubbing the myths. How a common teacher with children before him
can contradict such an authority?
The wording in the book is quite «scientific». However, the thinking
teacher feels that they are tricking him. What does it mean: evidently?
Somethingseen, evident, certain.
However, the scientist uses the word «evidently» as «probably» and brings
about a clear nonsense about coming of Iron in Egypt exactly in 2357 BC.
This is not a scientist but a well-read person, a plagiarist, but not an explorer.
And what about the Scientific Board of the Institute? It seems none...
Eventually, History lives in words. That is why it is so important to
establish timingofthefirstappearanceandmassutilizationofanotion.On
the other hand crucial are the time periods in the History when the notions
well common for us were simply not known by people.
This concerns both words and subjects. Self-containing subject is not
simply a philosophical determination. Both 5 million and 5 thousand years
ago, as well as today, the number of chemical elements or the number of



27
minerals in theBiospherehas been strictly determinated by the Nature and
realized as the Earth conditions permitted.
The fact, that up to the 17th century the humanity knew and utilized only 7
metals from 80 chemical elements with the metallic properties, evidences only
that the technologies of understanding and creation did not allow anything
different. The Earth core of both the far ancient times and of today contains
more than 3000 minerals, however prior to the 14th century people knew and
utilised to some extent up to one hundred minerals, in distinction of one another.
Aborigins of various regions possessed special knowledge. Thus,
Evenks or Eskimo were able to distinct up to 30-40 colour variations in the
white snow. And the inhabitants of the rainforests could distinguish
thousands of flowers and plants and hundreds of animals species. But how
could they convey their knowledge to the inhabitants of deserts? General
knowledgewas not required by anyone. It can not be applied in everyday
practice in the drastically different life conditions. Consequently, the ab
origin notions were not in need of anybody but the ab-origins themselves.
I.Savelieva and A. Poletaev (History and Time, 1997) refer to K.Jaspers
( Meaning and Purpose of History,1991) who identifies 4 historic periods.
«Period of science and technology», according to Jaspers, appears in
Europe «sincetheendof the18th century».
But we are unable to ignore the giants-thinkers, giants-physicists and
astronomers of the 15th — 18th centuries.
We, the people of the 21st century, would be much more wild if before
us had not lived and created Georgius Pletho, Leonardo da Vinci,
Machiavelli, Michelangelo, Copernicus, Rablet, Cervantes, Jordano Bruno,
Tiho Brague, Kepler, Galileo and those great masters of word who are
known by us under the trademark «Shakespeare».
But we know only those whose names have reached us through the
tim«eI. stood on the giants’ shoulders» said I. Newton, though we believe
that he himself and his contemporary colleagues Huygens, Hooke, Leibnitz
had started from scratch.
It is typical that in different countries their native centers of science and
technology appear, genius self-learners work, creating the base for the
future technologies. Lomonosov, Polzunov, Stephenson... how many other
unknown talants have vanished ... And this had happened long before the
end of the 18th century.
If History is a myth (see N.Berdiaev) then Jaspers is one of the myth
creators playing on downingthe human intellect. However there are much
more playing on raising. This is harmful too.
There is no need to down the intellectual potential of the humanity.
No intellectual stagnation existed up to the end of the 18th century. But
equally there is no need to claim the technology discoveries resulting from
ancient time. A human being can do only those things which are available
at his time.
People must be very brave, however, to claim, as historians H.Illig and
G.Heinssohn did:
«...history of Ancient Egypt lasted neither 3000 and even more nor 6000
years, but some 800 years and that ancient civilization developed in a
common way».

The chart shows some revolutionary events in the actual human history
on the background of the energy priorities.
Low heat supply energy sources were given to the man by the Nature
and it was only required to learn how to set and then to keep fires.
The time of wooden logs, sticks and argals is the longest one. It started
spontaneously and at different moments in different regions, continues
nowadays and will last until all the sourses of energy vanish.
The charcoal time emerged as a common event not earlier than the
14th century AD. It brought about a profession: charcoal burner. Logs
became raw material, high quality caharcoal- semiproduct for the metallurgy,
forging, ceramic works.
The time of charcoal goes on.
The wind energy, running water energy and, to great extent, muscular
power of animals and the man are still in use.
But that is also the time of the Industrial Revolution, development of
metallurgy, powder-based fire-arms, stone-cutting art, log sowing, wheeled
horse-driven transport, mining, mass production of bricks and concrete,
invention and copiing of sextant and spring-driven chronometer, emerging
of the Steam Engines, cutting diamonds and patented drugs, cavalry,
agrotechnics, breeding new species, horses, dogs, cows, sheep, goats,
cats, rabbits...
Thetimeof the coal came only in the 18th century. And it will continue
until all discovered deposits and ressourses of coal are exhausted in all
continents.
It was the time of steam boats, steamers, locomobiles, threaded fire
arm, dynamite...
Thetimeof oil, gas and hydropower, mass electrification, radio, aviation
and television came in 1900.
Thetimeof nuclear power and space exploration came in 1945-1950.
TheINTERNETtime came in 2000 AD.
Thetimeof unlimited international information exchange which is equal
to discovery of a new powerful energy source. For the whole World.
The Time of New Power Engineering is approaching.
The idea of obtaining the energy from the Power fields surrounding the
Earth is drawing nearer its practical solution.

NEW COMPARATIVE METHODS AND THE MAIN RESULTS OF THEIR APPLICATION TO HISTORIOGRAPHY
The conception of the «Cyclical Civilizations» which is the base of the
traditional historiography was proposed by N.Machiavelli, further developed
by father and son the Scaligers, by F.Bacon, and others in the 16th-17th
centuries and it was generally accepted in the 18th century resulting from
the «Public Treaty» of humanitarians and clericals. The concept reached
the top of its irrationality in the 20th century in the works of Oswald Spengler,
L.N.Gumilev and others.
The traditional historiography based on the artificial chronological
sequence reflecting the conception has been numerously criticized by the
scientists – proponents of the natural-scientific approach. Launched in the
16th century by Professor de Arcilla from Salamanca University, it was
continued by genius Sir Isaac Newton and abbat Jean Hardouin in the 17th
century and the critics was developed early in the 20th, in particular, by R.
Baldauf, E.Johnson and systematized on the naturall-scientific soil by
Academician N.Morozov.
At the end of the 70th (in the 20th century) Russian mathematician,
academician A. Fomenko offered new statistical methods of the analysis of
narrative texts (chronicles) and dating the astronomic events. He proved
that the history of Eurasia up to the 16th century had been «glued up» of
several repeated medieval chronicles misplaced in relation to each other in
the time and space.
He succeeded , to high level of probability, in the identification of three
time-related «shifts» in the past of the basic European chronicles: «Antic»
(or «Hebrew») shift of some 1800 years (i.e. the events of, say, the 14th
century AD have been referred by traditional historiography to the 5th
century BC.) European («Christian» or «Roman») shift by some 1050 years
( move of the Christmas backward by more than 1000 years and the
«Byzantian» shift by some 330 years (for instance, the «phantom» move
of the capital of the Roman Empire to Constantinople).
This work resulted in drafting of the Global Chronology Chart. Basing
on this approach in the 80-90 years of the 20th century A. Fomenko and his
co-author G. Nossovsky created their personal concept of the Human History
reconstruction (see bibliography). The Fomenko-Nossovsky conception,
generally opposed by the traditional historians is, however, supported by
the recently published works by Bulgarian scientist I.Tabov, Germans Prof.
H.Illig and G. Heinssohn, French historian R. Caratini etc.
A prominent French linguist E. Benveniste created in the second half of
the 20th century a strictly scientific linguistic method: «Word-Notion-Thing»
which let him prove unityrather thencyclingof the process of development
of both linguistic and social culture on the whole geographic area of Eurasia
during the traditionally considered period of time.



32
Just recently a Russian Art scientist A. Zhabinsky (in co-operation with
D. Kaluzhny and S. Valiansky) while analyzing the stylistics of art works
has proved the artificial character of the sinusoidal consequence of the
rises and falls in the fine arts suggested by the traditional historiography.
As it turned out the only prototype of the evolution of the «ancient
civilizations» is the progressive development of the Fine Arts in the 9th
17th centuries, while, for instance, «the drop» in the 1st-the 9th centuries
mirrors the said time period, and the «raise» in the 9th century BC — the
1st century AD is its «phantom duplication».
Working now in Japan paleaoclimatologist S. Chumichev basing on the
glaciology research has shown that the climatic conditions described in
the chronicles and generally referred to the 5th century BC – the 14th
century AD directly contradict to the experimental data, in particular, isotope
18O content in the continental eternal ice directly determining the periods of
notable heating and cooling periods on Earth and of consequent changes
in the life conditions.
Application of the methodology of systematic technology, material
research, humanistic and co-linguistic analysis to the historiographic sources
and subjects of material culture has let the authors of this book identify
several periods defining the substance of the development of modern
civilization.
They are, in particular, the second half of the 11th century – the blast of
a supernova in Taurus and its direct consequences: appearance of the
horse-driven transport in the middle of the 13th century followed by the
plague epidemic in the first half of the 14th century, drastic cooling in
Europe followed by the scurvy caused by it , fire-arms and book printing in
the 16th century, chemical and optical-mechanical revolution in the 17th
century, metallurgical and engineering revolution of the 18th century.
We have succeeded, at high probability rate, to define some additional
regionalchronological shifts within the traditional historiography. They are,
in particular, some 260-years late medieval historiographical shift (the
13th-16th centuries) backwards at the expense of the phantom «Tartar
Mongol Yoke» (proposedly in 1230-1490) which was also referred to as
Italian «Protorenaissance» and Spanish «Reconquista». This also relates
to a 150-years shift in the history of English Civilization compared to
Continental Europe, caused by the difference between the 260-year «yoke»
and a phantom «100-years long war».
«Islamic shift» into the past by some 800 years resulting in the modern
dating the Hegira Age has also appeared as the difference between the all
European «Christianity» shift (some 1060 years) and the phantom «Tartar
Mongol Yoke».
And the history of civilization in relation to the «peripheral» Japan, China,
India, Egypt beforethe19thcentury, as well as of all «extinct» civilizations
turns out to be fullyfictionof the 18th-20th centuries.
In brief, the findings of the research work and the concepts described
above are:
The modern civilization developed progressively as a solidunity from
perfectlyprimitivein the 9th century up to the «Antique Flourishing» in the
15th century on the natural background, without any measurable



33
technological pressure on the environment. Since the 16th century, when
the considerable surplus value appeared and the capitalist relationships
were established, the technology-driven differentiation of the humanity
began resulting in the creation of «nations» and «national states» which
still continues nowdays.
The evident crisis of the modern technically-oriented civilization is closely
connected with a wrong understanding of the history of its development.
This is the reason of the modern dilemma faced by the humanity: either
the cosmopolitan civilization of the selected ones based on the virtual
future, or ecologically stable civilization for everybody growing from
the real past.



34
CIVILIZING EVENTS
As measured by the Space rating, the human civilization is a young and
fast-passing one. Traditionally, Neolithic Age, some 5 to 6 thousand years
before Christ, is considered its beginning when the human beings in addition
to collecting way of life (hunting, picking-up the food, etc.) started the
productive activities (farming treatment, cattle breeding, handicraft etc).
Every production process at any moment requires meeting two conditions:
1) availability of some resource and 2) existence of some technology for
conversion of the resource into a product. All resources for the production
process are given by Nature, while technology is a human invention.
Any invention is preceded by discovery – finding by a man of the action
of a certain law of Nature earlier unknown to him. Thus, appreciation of the
laws of Nature lies under any invention, and, consequently, under any
technology of manufacture of any product, i.e. any anthropogenic activity.
Thus, civilization presents an undulating process: evolutional periods
(replication and reproduction of goods by means of conventional technology
and experience) alternate with revolutional ones (when a certain techno
logical burst takes place). Here the term «technological burst» is applied
not only to engineering and manufacturing but also to culture, i.e. art, music
and any other humane activity. So, in the widest sense, the term «civilizing
event» seems to be more appropriate than the «technological revolution»
when applied to a sharp rise of civilization upon a higher level.
Each civilizing event is defined by its interval. Interval of a civilizing event
is the time period from emerging of the sellable ( in broad terms) product up
to the beginning of its mass consumption by the humanity.
The beginning of the mass consumption of such a new product can be
identified theoretically as the moment when the number of users of the new
product exceeds 1/6, i.e. 17% of the total population.
For instance, Internet chronologically can be considered the last civilizing
event because the number of its users by 2000 had exceeded 1 billion
people while the total World population was 6 billion. A list of the main
civilizing events recorded in the history of the modern Humanity is shown in
the table. The intervals of the civilizing events as of today, can be defined
fairly reliably (+/- 20%) within the time period from 1500 AD up to now (see
Civilization periods ππ 15-22 in the table).
The analysis of these events identified by the humanity experimentally,
leads to the conclusions as follows:
1. The intervals of the civilizing events parallel in time to each other
which had already taken place at the same period of time (i.e. at the same
civilization step) are practically equal in duration;
2. The period of each consequent civilizing event is shorter than the
previous ones.
The first conclusion supports the well known fact that each generation
or époque enjoys its own development rate.
The second one stems from synergetics of simultaneous civilizing events
and ramifying of their consequences. For example, artillery and printing



35
are the civilizing events of the 15th century and their periods are evaluated
as about 100 years. At the beginning of the 19th century the period of such
civilizing events as steam-engine, vaccination and musical chromatic scale
amounted to 40 years. At the beginning of the 20th century current generator,
radio, telephone etc became civilizing evens within 20 years and so on.
One can see that within the historically well-dated term since 1500 AD
there are no «breaks of civilization» inspite of all wars, epidemic diseases
etc. Nor are there any experimental data to surmise such breaks in the
past since the Deluge. Analysis of more than 50 civilizing events since
1400 A.D. leads to a simple dependence of their intervals of realization
(periods, RI) on time t: RI (years, ± 20%) = 1500 – 0.2 t
Here t is the time since a certain start of civilization t0. This equation
presents a decreasing arithmethical progression and may be called an
equation of civilization rate. This rate is constantly accelerating while each
century RI is decreasing by 20 years.
In order to define t0 one must fix the firststep(the first stage of civilization)
and evaluate the number of consecutive steps from the beginning up to
nowadays.
As the first step one can accept fire-sustaining. This is a geneticalleap
separating a human being from an animal which is genetically tabooed by
fire. At this first step RI (1) = t1 (see Fig. 1). The number of consecutive
steps can be estimated by means of formal logics based on causal
relationship of CEs. As shown in the table and seen from Fig. 1, the number
of interpolatedconsecutive steps until 1500 AD amounts to 14 only (± 2).
From this the current age of human civilization can be estimated as 7500 ±
2500 years.
Study of consecutive steps of civilization is a powerful method to define
the right(not a certain «new»!) chronology. For example, cavalry and horse
driven transport could not physicallyexist in Western Europe until the 13th
century because until then there had been neither natural, nor artificially
created conditions for horse-keeping in this area, contrary to steppe areas.
Judging even from traditional references, at the beginning of the 12th century
in Italy or France a horse was extremely expensive – about $30000 if
recalculated. Both in Germany and Russia the largest penalty — Wergelt
— ought to be paid not for the murder of a free man or treason but for
horse-stealing. William the Conquerer gathered only about half a thousand
mercenaries mounted on horses out of the whole Western Europe and
nevertheless he won the Battle of Hastings, because opposing Harald’s
troops, numbering more than 5000 soldiers, were onfoot. And no cavalry
could exist had not harness technology been developed before, no armoured
free lance mounted on a horse could fight without stirrups etc.
The appearance of the horse-driven transport, which was much more
faster than the preceeding hard-surface transportation caused in Europe
another event – epidemics (plague the first of them). The medieval history
is full of descriptions of the terrifying consequences of the plague epidemics
which lasted in Europe hardly not a century just after introduction of the
horses and cavalry (the real epidemic was in 1347 – 1350).

Reliably dated intervals (periods ππ 15-22, from 1500 AD) are shown as solid black
line The numbers of the periods are marked by figures.
The modern epidemiology strictly insists that the epidemics can not last
in a region longer than ten, not to mention one hundred, years (for instance,
the famous «Spanish flu» in the 20th century lasted about two years: 1918
– 1919). If a new deadly infectious desease appears then the epidemic
vanishes as soon as the number of the infected and dead a per the number
of the non-infected and those who recovered exceeds a certain limit. The
plague endemic in Europe, (i.e. the permanent source of infection ) is
impossible because of the climatic conditions. More over, even in pandemic
regions (for instance, in the South-East Asia) the population is growing
notwithstanding the illness presence. This, in particular, leads to the
conclusion that no one thousand years period of stagnation of the population
grow in the 1st – 11th centuries AD ever existed and could not exist in
principle. The said above is well correlated with the interval of the Civilizing
events related to the horse breeding shown in the table.
To illustrate: the period of the cavalry introduction (π 13 in the table)
was preceeded by the period of development of saddle-making and invention
of harness and saddles (π 12). In turn this period follows Period 11 where
in parallel with the development of the raw leather dressing technology
required for production of the harness the horses were trained to be used
to the saddles etc. The corresponding scientific conclusions can be done
related to the consequence of the historical intervals of the following Civilizing
events within the whole time period before 1500 AD. The basic principle is
T, years



39
the uninterruptedchain of the civilizing events, i.e. uninterrupted character
of our chronology.
As seen from the table, the number of theconsequentialperiods of events
from the «Start» of the civilization beginning with the gaining the fire
(«Prometeus Effect») up to 1500 AD accounts in total some 15. Thus the
age of our civilization is estimated as 7500 years. It’s notable that the number
practically coincides with the Biblical («Byzantine») calendar from the World
Creation and with the beginning of Neolithic period as defined by archeology.
That moment, from our civilization position, opens the gap between the
«Neanderthal» and «Homo Sapiens» which can not be closed by any
evolutionary process per C. Darvin as between them an extracivilizational
geneticjump had occurred.
Shrinking of the intervals of the civilizing events almost down to zero
(see Fig.1) nowadays indicates the approaching end of our civilization, but
not the apocalyptical finish but a new extracivilizationaljump.
Figure 2 illustrates correlation between the Earth population and total
annual energy consumption time wise. According to Curve 2 the drastic
changes have started after 1500 AD. Curve 1 corresponds to the natural
biological reproduction of the humanity and to consumption of the natural
energy sources such as dry wood, straw, manure, etc. The situation had
existed prior and up to the year 1500 AD. Without the consequent technical
revolution the human population would account for only 800 million. If
nothing is done for the stabilization of the population growth the Curve 4
would be realized. It is doubtful, however because the humanity has not
succeeded as yet in the search for more powerful and less harmful energy
source than nuclear energy while the available fossil fuels do not offer
enough energy for the relevant population growth. Thus, sooner or later,
the Curve 4 will turn into Curve 3: this is the scenario of Caribbean nuclear

40
crisis of 1962, avoided, to our luck. If it had occurred then Curve 3 would
have thrown the humanity back to Curve 2. (Similar results have been
reached by the calculations and speculations of the supporters of the
«Golden Billion» Program). If the UNESCO preview achieves through
application of special programs and energy-efficient technologies then the
population in the 21st century will level at 11-12 billion at the energy
consumption related to this figure (Curve 5).
It is evident that the humanity witnesses a certain phase transition. Why
did that phase transition start about 1500 AD? Most probably, because at
that time two crucial civilizing events occurred: appearance of fire-arms
and book printing. The first event resulted in mass killing people and animals.
The emergency of new power had caused wide-growing wood-cutting and
initiated a non-reversible technogen pressure on the environment. The
second event created politology and technology of the mass pressure on
the human minds. So the first PR appeared – creating and propaganda of
false historiography and of the traditional chronology.
At the time interval 1500-2000 no discrepancy between Figures 1 and 2
exists. The problem is that, following the false traditional chronology created
in the 16th century by Scaliger the demographists do not accept the natural
Curve 2 up to 1500 AD in Figire 2. They are forced to implant there four
plateaus: 200-200, 1200-1300, 1400-1500 and 1600-1650 and the «plague
drop» (1300-1400) when, as they believe, a quarter of the Earth population
died out. These artificial constructions are based solely on the phantom
information taken from certain «ancient books». Thus the demographists
are forced to estimate the population at the early neolith era as 50 million
which is very far from the archaeologcal data. Extrapolation of Curve 2
from 1500 AD (when the population was some 440 million) to the beginning
of the neolithic era at the fixed rate 0.1 % required for survival brings us to
the number of the homosapiens transmutated from homohabilis at the
beginning of the neolithic era as not exceeding half a million species.
Rehabilitation of the correct chronology is acutely needed at least because
the false chronology drastically distorts the starting parameters of the phase
transition faced by our civilization. This can result in faulty forecasts with
bad consequences. Post-genom human being will differ from the modern
one to the same extent as we differ from the homohabilis. And if a new,
genuinely scientific and natural versus to the «agreed upon» civilization
paradigm has not been established then the apocalypse is just round the
corner. So, folks, be ready....

NATURAL HISTORY OR POLITICAL HISTORIOGRAPHY?
The «Independent Newspaper» of October 28, 2000 informed us:
THEY HAVE FAILED TO READ THE «LETTER TO THE FUTURE»
InOldNovgorodthelong-awaitedhappeningtookplace:fromthewallof

Komsomolofthe1960-stotheyoungpeopleof2000.

paperhasalmostcompletelydecayed.
Eventhecopyofthemessagecouldnotbefound.Onecopyhasbeen
lost somewhere in Novgorod, another one was taken in 1966 by the correspondentofthe«KomsomolskayaPravda»andneverreturnedback.
So the paper and the message written on it have not been saved by
technologies of the 20th century. Paper appears to be not a very reliable
preserver of information. And what about ancient «The Lay of Igor’s Warfare»
– of what time was the paper it was written on? Those papers were definitely not kept in a stainless steel casket.
We have mentioned already such a civilizing event as the invention of
book-printing. Among its necessary components there the production of
paper and of printer’s ink. It is assumed traditionally that paper was first
manufactured in China in the 2nd century AD. The production of mineral pigments was also developed there. Does it mean that the Chinese were
less smart than European engineers or could not find time to invent a printing
press? Or, on the other hand, were Europeans such savages that in 1200
years they could not learn to use paper? The matter is that both paper and
printer’s ink came into use approximately at the same time as steel dies for striking coins and the technique of engraving – not earlier than the 14th
century, i.e. by the civilization rates of those times – in the course of not
more than a hundred years after their invention, be it in China or in
Tmutarakan’.
Material science allows to state, that in 800–1000 years paper as a thermodynamically unequilibrical material was obliged to rot completely.
Therefore there can not be any paper documents earlier than the 11th
century. Were there any paper in China in the 2nd century or not – it does
not matter, none of it could have survived till the present time, no matter
under what conditions it was preserved. It had to decompose on account of its nonequilibrium. It is thermodynamics, one of the most fundamental natural
disciplines. There is no point in arguing against it, as Boltzmann used to
sayT.echnical advance is undulatory: periods of accumulating the experience
of the use of some natural resource and corresponding technologies are



68
replaced by periods of some new resource exploration (or of a new quality
of a known resource) and the appearance of new technologies, i.e. by a
technical revolution which promotes civilization to a new, higher level, where
the process repeats itself.
For example, firewood allows to reach the temperature of «red heat»,
which is enough to fire clay vessels, smelt lead and tin, copper and the
alloys containing these metals – i.e. bronze. For the development of ferrous
metallurgy other energy resources are required – coal. To make steel we
need coking coal which allows to reach the temperature of «white heat».
Ferrous metallurgy demands also the use of fluxes. Only under these
conditions we can produce not just earthenware but also glass.
The most primitive opaque glass is inseparably linked with the use of
coal, with the development of ferrous metallurgy. But the traditional history
continuously repeats, that the manufacture of glass was known in Egypt
four thousand years BC, i.e. three thousand years before the age of iron.
From the point of view of natural sciences it is absurd.
When studying numerous wars historians often forget the economic
axiom, that all wars which ever took place – were a struggle for the control
over natural resources and routes of their transportation, starting from the
riches of the Promised Land in the Bible and ending with the oil of the
Persian Gulf not far from that very land.
Here we give only a very small part of those examples when the traditional
history contradicts the data of natural sciences. But even these few examples
allow to call this traditional history, of the European civilization in particular,
a political historiography.
Take notice that the ideological orientation of the traditional history
contradicts those very laws of philosophy which completely agree with the
methods of natural sciences, like the dialectics of Hegel or the conditions of
human society optimisation formulated by Kant. That is why it ignores the
investigations into history made by Newton and Lomonosov, making their
heroes of such adventurers and hoard-searchers as Schliemann and
Champolion, or the falsificators of the Russian history like Schlötzer and
Tischendorf.
Modern apologists of traditional history are making war on the works by
Fomenko’s school of mathematics which applies methods of statistical
analysis to that very traditional history. Why don’t specialists in
macroeconomics make war on mathematics applying the same methods
to their discipline? Because economics as a modern science practically
ceased to be ideological. History still remains a political historiography.
The role of historians, archaeologists, palaeographists, etc. should be in no
way diminished. On the opposite, a vast field of activity is open to them
they should create history anew as a scientific discipline free of any
ideological directives – to replace the present ideologically orientated
pseudo-historiography.
Political historiography has its own founder – an outstanding Byzantine
statesman Georgius Pletho (1355–1450). This man had foreseen the
disintegration of the Byzantine and was trying to substantiate the necessary
reforms of the state apparatus. Realizing that the Empire was doomed, this
83-year old patriarch moved to Florence and brought there his archives.



69
There, sponsored by the Medicis family, he founded his «Platonic» academy
(though there is more reason to call it «Plethonic»).
After the fall of Constantinople in 1453 this «Platonic family» started its
boisterous activities in «discovering» and publishing «ancient sources»,
using, in particular, such publishers and traders like P. Bracciollini, often
exposed by his contemporaries as a maker of fake manuscripts. Someone L. Bruni, Florentine chancellor, did a good job on behalf of his Medici masters:
to glorify their ancestry he published in 1439 (a year after Pletho’s arrival
with all his Byzantine archives) his 12-volume «History of Florence» (that is
before book-printing!) by simply re-writing Byzantine chronicles and replacing
some names and place-names by Florentine ones. The history of Florence immediately became longer by 260 years.
From that very time the city became the world artistic centre trading in
«Byzantine antiquities» till the present time. That is why the newly-made
Laocoon was suddenly discovered in the courtyard of the great Michel
angelo’s workshop; after the appearance of Leonardo’s and Raphael’s masterpieces they no less suddenly discover the works of Italian «proto
Renaissance» painters (Giotto, Cimabue, etc) – there were not enough
Byzantine items on the market. It is typical that they were not trading in
icons – the Ottoman state punished those stealing Orthodox icons by
chopping off their hands, so it was dangerous, and Florentine artists did not know how to paint them. As for «ancient manuscripts» – it became a mass
production. And not only in Florence – it continued till the 20th century.
And in the 19th century we have brilliant confirmation of the falsification
of the European culture. Alexander Pushkin was not only a great poet after 1832, when he developed doubts in the truthfulness of the Russian
history written by Karamzin, he became a careful historian. There are few
who know it. When reading «the Songs of Western Slavs» passed by P.
Mérimé for his translations of the original Bosnian folklore, Pushkin
suspected a forgery. At his request his friend S.A. Sobolevsky wrote a letter to Mérimé, asking to explain the origin of these «Guzla» songs. In his
reply «honest» Mérimé, being caught red-handed, admitted that he had
invented all the poems and songs just to make a joke and «to disgrace all
these falsificators of ancient poetry». Even Adam Mickiewicz took his fakes
for real folklore. This example shows, how easy it was even in the 19th century to falsify «ancient monuments».
There are no original manuscripts written in Hebrew or Greek scripts
earlier than the 15th century. In the same way there are no Latin manuscripts
prior to the 13th, like there are no originals by Dante and Boccacio in Italy,
by D. Wykliff and R. Bacon in England, F. Bonaventura in France and by other authors attributed to the 13th century. All supposedly «ancient»
manuscripts are lost, literary works exist only in later copies. And there is
not a single building in Rome built prior to the 15th century but for the
unfinished Colosseum. The surviving architectural monuments of the 13th
— 14th centuries somewhere in Florence and Pisa display striking Byzantine features.
All this testifies to the total absence of any European culture before the
13th century – it was a part of the Byzantine culture. None of the West



70
European cathedrals have golden domes, like in Russia. In Russia great
Andrew Rublev painted icons and decorated churches 100 years before
great Leonardo. Orthodox altar compositions by Rublev and Catholic
«retablo» in Spain made at the same time are compositionally and functionally uniform – they belong to the same Byzantine culture.
Traditional historiography states that Batu invasion lead to ravage of
Kiev Rus. But is not it strange that immediately after the seizure of Kiev
there began rapid construction of Orthodox churches, there appeared a
bishop (a metropolitan), etc.? And is not it strange that the oldest Orthodox church of Bosnian Sarayevo (the 15th century) looks like a synagogue
(without a cupola, a belfry, even without a cross) but with nave shelter for
praying women inside – i. e. like a mosque?
No less strange are those sacred edifices of Western Europe which still
preserve the architectural features of the 13th — 14th centuries – like the baptisteria of Florence and Pisa. These are actually roofed pools divided
into sections and designed for mass baptism. These are functional
structures, not monuments, built in those times when there was a real need
in mass baptism, not individual, like now.
It means that in Western Europe Christianity became the religion of the masses not in the 4th century but after the 14th century. In Old Pisa, for
example, besides its defensive walls, there are only four ancient monuments:
the most ancient is the baptisterium mentioned above, the famous falling
bell-tower, the cathedral of St. John and... the Hebrew cemetery functioning
till the present time, made, after the Byzantine fashion, to the left of the gates outside the city-walls. But ancient Jews performing Byzantine rites
were called Khazars in Russian. As there are no Christian burials in Old
Pisa, it means the city had been actually founded by those same Khazars.
The Khazar creed was in many ways different from orthodox Judaism – it was rather Judeo-Christian creed. It sounds strange for our religiously
separated world. But it was not strange for the Byzantine Empire, one of its
principle foundations being religious tolerance.
The loss of tolerance was cased by the real, not legendary, institution of
the Papal seat in Rome, which took place only in 1376. The activities of the Catholic Church enforcing Latin liturgy and trying to concentrate in its hands
both secular and spiritual authority brought forth a total war in Europe.
Among the episodes of this war were the Battle of Kulikovo (1380), the
Battle of Kossovo (1389), Italian «ciompi»(1378) and W. Tyler (1381)
insurrections, enforced conversion of Lithuania to Catholicism and so on. The schism (1415–1431) and the failure of the attempt to build a new unity
(the 1439 Unia) caused the religious separation of the Western and Eastern
parts of the Empire, which predetermined the fall of Constantinople in 1453
and appearance of Muslim South.With the loss of this universally recognized
centre of culture and civilization the period of feudal division in Europe began. After 1415 there appeared the Byzantine refugees, spreading sparkles
of «ancient Greek» and «ancient Hebrew» cultures both to the west and to
the east. In Russia these refugees started monotheistic tradition, transformed
later to Orthodoxy. But Russian history says something quite different: «The
Noble Boyar, Tartar murza so-and-so moved from the Horde to Rus.»



71
Russia did not break its old ties with the former centre: relations with the
Turkish Sultan remained friendly, till the coming of the Romanovs’ family to
power. Sultan’s janissary bodyguards were all Christians, Istanbul officials
were graduates from Moscow schools. In Western Europe, which parted with the «infidels», objects of Byzantine
culture became a rarity. There they quickly realized that trade in Byzantine
antiquities and even in their imitations (or fakes) could be profitable. The
most popular Italian author of the 15th century, P. Bracciollini, who was
honoured with a monument in his life-time, writes for «the chosen» in Latin novels-translations from Greek authors. Their Greek «originals» appeared
later, in the 16th century, being translated from Latin into Greek. A very
precise definition of the novel genre — romanticstory, i.e. Greeco-Roman
narrative, because the Greek call themselves Romees). It can be applied
to all primary sources – Herodotus, Plutarch, Thucidides, Titus Livy, etc. There is one more question: why did the famous Italian author of the
15th century wrote only in Latin? Was not it assumed, that the national
Italian literary language had been created a hundred year before his time
by Dante and Petrarch? Probably, because there was neither real Italian,
nor the works by Dante and Petrarch before Bracciollini’s time –they would appear in 50 years or even later. That is also why he never referred to
these authors.
Not only Italian, but all the national literary languages in Western Europe
began to form in the 16th century. These include «correct» English enforced
by Elizabeth I, the «New French» and «New Greek» languages, the «allGerman» language of Martin Luther’s Bible and so forth. There was no
Spanish language – in Spain itself modern Spanich is still called Castellano.
Enforcement of Latin, and the national languages based on it was
accompanied with the book auto-da-fe: the Inquisition sent all «suspicious» books into the fire. (The same did Russian Orthodox Church even in the
end of the 18th century.)
The main impulse to the West European publishing activity (first in Latin,
then in Greek) was given by a part of the Byzantine library brought to
Florence by Pletho and his associates in 1438. Why did they bring those books to Florence, not to Rome? Probably for
that reason that there, not in Rome, was the tax treasury of the former
Empire controlled by the Medici’s family, the hereditary usurers. That very
money served to publish Pletho’s «Utopia» and to maintain his academy.
Florentine book-publishing activities immediately attracted the attention of Rome. The Papal Seat urgently needed to become more ancient than
flourishing Florence. Immediately the works by the «ancient» Titus Livy
and Cornelius Tacitus were discovered in the Florentine library (directed by
Bracciollini) and published for the first time in 1469-1472 – their aim was to
confirm the antiquity of Rome. By the way, at that time there lived a real Italian Tito Livio, hired by the English to produce the chronicles of the
Hundred-Year War.
At the same time masterpieces of «ancient» philosophers, dramaturgs
and poets revealed themselves: for example, «Anthology of Ancient Greek
Epigram» was published only in 1494.



72
The same concerns natural science. Only after the ingenious Leonardo
da Vinci (1452-1519) works by Archimedes become known in Europe
(1544), along with those by the famous inventor Girolamo Cardano (1501
1576). The legendary biography of Archimedes has much in common with the life of Cardano. «Archimedes», like most other ancient names, is not a
name at all. In Greek it is «the principle of principles» – more like the title of
a textbook. And the «Principles» by Euclid (in Greek – «the Celebrated
one») are published along with the works by François Viète (1540–1603),
the creator of modern algebra. All astronomical data which can be observed by human eye is systematized in the works by Nicholas Cusanus and
Nicholas Copernicus. They are the first who cite «ancient» astronomers
Ptolemy and Hipparchus. These examples illustrate
the substitution of imaginary «Renaissance» for the real
process of scientific, cultural
and artistic development. The
notion itself was invented in
France only in the 17th century, in the
Counterreformation period,
when the division of the
heritage of the Byzantine
World Empire had been accomplished, Reformation
and Counterreformation
being its parts.
The division of the old and the forming of the new
Empires took place on the
conditions of ideological
compromise between the
«clericals» (adherents of the Pope) and «humanists»
(supporters of secular
authority). The first ones were
satisfied by the admission of
the «antiquity» of their church and the institution of Papacy,
the others – by the
recognition of the
«renaissance» within the new
empires of «ancient traditions» whence from the
pedigrees of all new rulers
were drawn explaining their
hereditary rights to enslave
their own peoples.
«Alexander Nevsky» is coming against Swedes...
In 1238 or 1709?



73
In the 15th century Byzantine utopist Pletho dreamt to restore the
Byzantine Empire as a world state of bien etre generale. At the end of the
same century Machiavelli, the founder of political science, formulated the
thesis, still determining the relations between power and history: «A ruler is in need of such a history which can help him rule his people more effectively».
Thus, instead of continuous process of development, in the history of
each European state there appeared a period of «ancient bloom», then of
«decline», followed by another «renaissance». Thus the universal Byzantine
Horde history turned into «the Yoke» for ones, and into «proto-Renaissance» for others. What has happened in the last 500 years after the division of
Europe – let the reader decide it for himself.

Sometimes snobbery of political historiography turns into farce:

MONOTHEISM ORIGIN AND FORMATION
WHERE AND WHEN DID MOSES MAKE HIS TRIP
Let’s take one of the non-traditional versions of the events forming the
basis of the Book of Exodus and the following Book of Joshua, Son of Nun, for a graphical example.
According to the Bible the following can be said about Moses with
certitude: he was brought up in the family of the ruler of the State of Mitz
Rome, got a supernatural revelation in the form of two tablets (two-page
stone document) and became a fierce preacher of monotheism and antipaganism fighter. Here comes the nickname «Moses (Mshe)»- «savior,
deliverer».
By Mitz-Rome usually translated as «Ancient Rome» and associated
with Egypt we don’t mean Egypt but Sicily with the capital Palermo, from
Greek Palaio Rome — «Ancient Rome». There is also a mountainous granite cape Granitola , covered with «Jewish stone» – graphite quartz
feldspar fusings reminding either of cuneiform or of Arabic character, or of
letters in Sanskrit or in Hebrew – such «tablets» may be only found in
granite masses or in pegmatite bodies, but never in effusive rocks. And not
far from Granitola cape there is the smoke of the volcano of Aetna — of biblical Zion — the mountain of Sin, the mountain of Sinners (compare
also Sünde in German and sinister). This landscape closely matches the
biblical description.
But how could the Moses’ people on foot, pursued by the cavalry, without
boats get from Sicily to Calabry across the strait of Messina? The very mentioning of the cavalry means that the described events took place not
earlier than in the 13th century. It should be reminded now that by the end
of the 15th century it grew significantly colder on the Earth – the average
temperature fell nearly by 6 degrees, the ocean level was lower by
approximately 10-12 meters. There was actually no Sea of Azov (its maximum depth is about 14 meters) and it was fairly called the Swamp of
Meoth, meanwhile the Black Sea ought to have been completely frozen in
winter. There was no strait between the British Isles and the continent – the
northern part of the strait was covered with ice, this is why nowadays the
strait name sounds «La Manche» in French, English meaning is «sleeve». Reasoning from the same the Strait of Messina could also freeze
temporarily and the cavalry could fall in through the thin ice layer. And the
Moses’ successfully travelled from Sicily to Haribda, to the shore, where
mountHoribis still smoking. Horibis the mount of Horror (compare horror,
horrible in English). Another name for the sinister mountain Horib is Vesuvius. (In Italian
vizio«flaw, defect», in English and Frenchvice, in Spanish and Portuguese
vicio, this may be the explanation of the Latin name of this volcano).
The following Moses’ deeds are connected with persistent wars, with
occupation of foreign territories by his adherents and with a massacre not

only over the conquered pagans but also over the backsliders from their peculiar people. If the similar events occurred today, such a «chosen people»
would be called a militant sect.
Moses’ sect obviously was afraid of the plague and of other epidemics
and followed strict quarantine rules, so that reasoning from these in the
Book of Exodus the events described were not earlier than the end of the 14th century, this means after the first catastrophic plague epidemic, spread
by cavalry in the continent depth. Moses’ ancestors could have taken shelter
from it in Sicily. Moses’ troops had the following rules: no prisoners, death
to everybody, death for looting. The captured metal and other precious
items passed through fire or at least through boiling water. Moses’ warriors like the present Judaists didn’t cut their beards according
to the vow. «Bearded» warriors are commemorated in the history of the
Middle Ages as barbarians (barbari), Lombards (long-bearded) and in the
geographical name — Lombardy. Obviously Moses’ followers – chosen
people – should not be associated with the Jewish people. Ethnically this is still a very diverse chosen people — look at the anthropologic diversity of
the modern Jews in Israel. In Latin judici means «judges», JusDei– the
Divine Justice, thus probably originating the very word Jews.
In the modern history there is a bright analogue: a chief-ecclesiast Fidel
(outspoken) leads his bearded warriors (barbudos) – white, dark, metises, mulattos – to Cuba, the Promised Land...
During his march Moses having passed the deadly Vesuvius, the vapors
of which killed birds on the wing, crossed a certain frontier – «Stream



344
Ahrnon». This is a natural geographical frontier, dividing the Western Europe
in the direction South-North, created by two rivers Arno in the northern
Italy, the river Rhone and the adjoined by a canal Rhein. On the Rhein the
biggest in Europe coal-field and metallurgical center Ruhr are located
(Ruhr comes for biblical «Aruhr on the steam of Ahrnon»). The northern
border of the campaign is Saar (saar comes for biblical Asohr), Lorraine
(Lot’s Land) and Saxony (Isaac’s sons ).
From archaeology it is known that some time in the North of Italy there
lived Celtic (Baltic-Slavic) tribes (particularly the Boii founded Bologna and
the Veneti who founded Venice. Here in province of Tuscany there is a city
of Arona, after Aaron, Moses’ brother).
Also in the northern Italy there is a place named Ivrea. Here there are
biblical Atharim, Bethel, Medeva, Nebo, Oboth, Halaad, Jeleale, Syren,
Haretz, Notha, Peohorma... i. e. existing Turin, Bettola, Mede, Novara,
Ovade, Gualliatte, Olio, Saronno, Guarece, Onette, Parma etc. From here
Moses sent scouts to «see Iazer» — the valley of the Izer river, the tributary
of the Rhone river, «Bene-Jakaan, Ben-Tzion» (Venice) and «Vaal
Tzion»(Bologna). A part of his adherents inhabited «Guaran» (Guaronne),
«Caphtor» (Castre), «Nimre» (Nîmes) and «Divon» (Divonne, now city of
Cahor) in the south of France (also compare Namure in Belgium and Duven
in Switzerland).
Here from the West to the East the river Po-Eridan is flowing, separating
the Apennines peninsula from the rest of Europe «up to Eridan» – up to the
northern side of the Adriatic Sea.
It is clearly seen that a part of the campaign events is geographically
located in the northern Italy and in Moravia, on the other Adriatic shore.
Particularly in the north of Italy in the battle of Adria Moses beat «Hugh, the
tsar of Bassan», who lived in «Bassan in Ashteroth», died being «the last of
the Rethaims» in the battle and was buried in «Rabba». The cities of
Ravenna and Bassana (del-Grappa) still exist and are situated right in the
northern Italy close to Slavic Bosnia Bosna. Biblical Ashteroth is Moravian
Ostrava whoch exists up to now.
The battle of Adria obviously reflects a really significant event, for the
name of the Adriatic Sea originated from the name of this small town. (It is
important that the nickname «Hugh the Bassan» in Slavic «Ug of Bosna»,
in French «Hugues Capet» – Hugh the Head, the founder of the well known
European Capetian dynasty, also Hugh Hohenst(a)ufen – Hugo the
Superior, the dynasty of the Hohenstaufens).
Moses’ warriors also beat «tsar Sigon». But the city and the port of
Savona happily neighbors today with Genova (biblical Kenath) in the very
northern Italy. Biblical tsar Sigon is alike well-known Sigismund – the
Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, Moravian, Hungarian and Czech king,
the persecutor of hussites (the first quarter of the 15th century!).
The name Sigismund means «victor» (compare German Sieg, English
siege), in Greek — hegemon. According to the Bible he was from the
Amorreuses, that beat the «Moabites» – Moravia inhabitants.
It is exactly the place, where the «Meriva waters» flow – a part of Danube
basin, including both of the Morava rivers (right and left tributaries of the
Danube) up to the confluence with the river Prut, where the «great river of

A happy medieval city. The wall was located
only in the front. On the other sides the city
was neither embanked nor surrounded by
walls. So what was the attack subject?
But there were trumpeters, dozens, maybe
hundreds of them. The medieval monks blow

caps, lamb hats, fur-hats. No barefoot people

lands are framed with forest stretches,
protective strips.

Prut and the lower Danube up to
the city of Ishmael (biblical Samuel).
The biblical «madiamites, madianes» – more probably
Magyar (from Hungarian
«magyar») from the name of which
possibly the name of the city of
Milan originated (Magyarlant Me(d)iolan(um) — Milano). The
biblical «country Moab» received
its name probably because the
main part of its population was
nomadic – «mobile, moving», from the root «mob» (compare German
«Mob» – «mob, crowd» and
«move»). Actually the remnants of
these nomadic tribes and Gypsies
are still always on road in the modern Moab – Yugoslavia,
Czechia, Hungary, Romania,
Bulgaria, Moldova, Ukraine and in
Southern Russia.
It is more interesting that Old Testament «Bosnian tsar Hugh»
was of the Rethaims. «Rethaim» is
plural of Rethe, Rethe is the name
for the Russians in this part of Europe (ruthenes, Ruthenia =
Russia). In Yiddish the word for
«Russian» sounds as «reizen» and
«Russia» as «Reizya».
In the Old Testament it is also mentioned that «the Rethaims used
to inhabit the counry of Argoes (Ar
Goim)». But nowadays by word
«goy» the jews call non-jews, that
is why Ar-Goim means «The Land of the Faithless» – compare Arago
in Spain. We should note that the
Slavs used «goy» for a usual greeting which meant «Keep well».
The march of the «settlers» from Italy onto the Eastern Adriatic Shore
(through Po-Eridan – biblical Jordan) did not omit the biblical mentioning of Adriatic islands – for example Jiabok – the Island of Jabuka.
And on the opposite side of the Adrian Bay a Slovenic city and port of
Rieka is situated (Rieka = Jerico in English). It used to suffer from periodical
earthquakes, ruining its walls. (the name of the city Rieka actually means
«river», the Italian name of Rieka is Fiume – «river»).

The «Rethaims», according to the
Bible, had a capital in Cyriat–A(h)rby.
The word «cyriat (cyriath)» means
«town, suburb». Cyriat is probably the same as Slavic «Grad, gorod (city)»,
simply resounded in a different way.
Here comes Grad Zagreb, its German
name is Agram, Jewish – Og-Rom, this
is «Hugh’s capital (!)». The seaport Pula mentioned in the Bible still exists
on the shore of the Adriatic Sea.
The name of another Adriatic
seaport – Split (Spalato in Italian)
remained in the biblical story about beating of the faithless by the Moses’
adherents near the crossing. They
killed those who could not pronounce
sibilants, who said «sabolet» instead
of «shabolet». The biblical mountainous country
Jermon is still in Bosnia and from the
ancient times is known by the name of
Romania – a high mountainous fertile
valley with mild climate. The Moses’ folk in Yugoslavia
entered biblical Zared (modern Zadar,
Zara in Italian), Yatz (Yaitze), Vagreb(
Ar) (Vukovar), Mozer (Mostar), Hay... They passed by the «Land of Saba’s sons» – along the Saba river up to the very «Khutzoth», to the settlements
of Serbian Kossovo on the frontier with the modern Albania.
Meanwhile the anniversaries of the trip were celebrated by holidays
(Sabbath) in several South Slavic cities carrying double names that included
word «Sobota», in the city of Shabatz and in Magyarian city Sombathey. They lived in the Czech Moravia together with «Scithe’s sons» (the
Scythians!) and in Beth-Jeshimoth (Shumava), in Ave-Sittim (Ausitim = Usti
nad-Labem)), in Cadis-Barni (Cadesh-Brne in Hebrew), that is in Brno, the
Hussites’ strongwork (by the way the biblical mount Tabor is located there
too). The southern part of Moses’ marsh ran across Slovenic cities Libiano
(modern Liubliana), Libna (modern Livna), and Knun (modern Knin) – across
the «Land of Canaan». Strictly speaking in the Bible the «Canaanites» are
not the inhabitants of some unknown country Canaan, but word-by-word
the followers (or descendants) of «Johanaan», i. e. of John the Baptist Judeo-Christians, the prototype of the modern Baptists.
Further the itinerary lay across the territory of modern Romania – «Ahrad,
the kingdom of Harad, lying to the South of the Land of Canaan (Slavic
Moravia)» – these are modern cities of Arad and Oradya. Not far from the
city Arad there is mount Vaskeu = biblical mountain Phasgy.



347
Abraham and Melchizedek.
Altar part by D. Bauts. 1464-67. Leben,
Church of Saint Peter.
Ahrad, the Kingdom of Harad is
related to the notions of Horde and
Rada (= Council). By the origin these
Slavic words mean «the given word, order, oath» (compare ord in Swedish,
Wort, Rede «pronouncing a vow» in
German, cf. read). This is why the
«hordians» are the warriors,
Cossacks, Legionnaires, Knights. Today nobody knows where
Moshe the Deliverer is buried: «in the
Land of Moabit across Beth-Phehor
(Beth = home)». In Hungarian Moravia,
however, Beth-Pheor sounds in Hungarian way: Buda-feher, in Czech
Moravia – in Czech way: Bud(o)var,
and in Germany, in Berlin in particular,
an old Jewish cemetery was called
Budepfarre (the house of a priest) and was situated in the district of Moabit,
famous for its prison.
It should be noted that in Italian this
name was the origin for «buttaforia»
«fake». Finally it turns out that the events
described in the Book of Exodus at least partly took place in Moravia and
Northern Italy, where the ruler was Bosnian and came from the Ruthenians.
In such circumstances notions «Bosende» (Bosnian) and «Byzantine» are actually identical.
After the Moses’ death the march across the territory of modern Bulgaria
was headed by Joshua, Son of Nun. He aimed at Constantinople in his
campaign. There he is buried — in a huge tomb on the mount Beykoz.
But in this variant the biblical trip of Moses and Joshua, Son of Nun, practically fits in the description of the Crusades to the Constantinople!
(One of possible interpretation variants of Moses’ and Joshua’s biblical
trip is presented here as description of the events in the end of the 14th
beginning of the 15th century. Another variant is considered in the books
by G. Nossovsky and A. Fomenko). Thus the «Moses’ crusaders» discovered the real «Promised Land»
the territory from Switzerland to South Russia, including the eastern
shore of the Adriatic Sea.
We think it important to demonstrate on this example that the Book of
Exodus does not describe the pre-historical times, but rather late Middle Ages, the post-plague times.
The usage of an odd term «Judeo-crusaders» is not accidental, however,
the Monotheistic religion had not split into separate ecclesiastical institutions
by that time. It was in the post-plague times, when the religious separation
started on the casual everyday grounds. Each community blamed strangers

To the Exodus geography. There is a Latin scripture on Moses’ scroll: «DANOBIS AQVA
VT BIBAMVS» reflecting the Spanish pronunciation of the phrase «Danubis aqua ut
vivamus», i. e. «Invigorating Danube water».

for carrying in the infection, because of the difference in hygiene rules, food
style etc. The border between the 14th 15th centuries, where we have put the events
of the Exodus, in the conventional history is marked by a global antagonism.
Here we have the well-known «double papacy» – the fight between
«Anglo-Saxon» Pope Urban the 6th and «French» Pope Clement VII
(and the following) for the apostolic see, also an anti-papal revolt of sheepbreeders under W. Tyler command in England in 1381.
There is also a Catholicism violent propagation in pagan Baltic counties
(1380-1389), the famous Battle of Kossovo in Yugoslavia and Kulikovskaya
Battle in Russia.
In 1378 crusader Nerio Acciaioli together with his Navarrians captured Athens. In this very period the eight-year revolt of the Zealots outbreoke in
Greece (and in «Judaic Wars» by Josephus Flavius the Zealot revolt in
Palestine dates back to the 1st century AD, moreover the name of one of
the pillar apostles was Simon Zealot).
In the history of Florence the year of 1378 is marked by the revolt of wool-carders «ciompi», with a foreign leader Michele di Lando, which the
most probable means Michael of Landau (city Landau in Bavaria). At the
same time in the conventional Russian history prince Michael of Tver (of
Tevere = Italian) is at war with prince Dmitry Donskoy in Russia.
On the golden coins of Henry VII the Tudor Archangel Michael hitting a

dragon with a spear. is stamped. In the Anglicanism the only holiday
Michael’s day is called similarly to the Christmass – Michaelmas. On the
Russian war banners up to the 17th century Archangel Michael was often
depicted, blessing Joshua for battle. So what is the difference between this Michael and Moses blessing that very Joshua?
The Norwegians have an expressive proverb:»Vi er alle jyder for
Vårherre» translated as «we are all sinners in the Face of God». Word-by
word translation however is «We are all Danes in the Face of God». Really
once the Danes used to be the masters of the Norwegians. But actually it is much closer to the sense to read this proverb as «We
are all Jews in the Face of God» for Norwegian «jyder» (Danes) and «jøder»
(Jews) are nearly the same when pronounced.
This is a direct citation from Moses...
On the illustration to the Bible (made supposedly in the 16th century) Moses is depicted giving water to the thirsty Jews. There is a Latin scripture
on his scroll: «DANOBIS AQVA VT BIBAMVS» reflecting the Spanish
pronunciation of the phrase «Danubis aqua ut vivamus», what means
«Invigorating Danube water».
So when did Moses live and where did he make his trip?
WHERE CHRIST WAS CRUCIFIED
AND WHEN PAUL THE APOSTLE LIVED
What’sour profit, Ifyouareaprophet? AquestionoftheSanhedrimToSt.Paul
Traditionally it is believed that Christ was crucified on the Golgotha mound
in that very Jerusalem which exists at this very place today. Canonical Gospels tell us about it in all world languages. Nevertheless in the Gospels
themselves there are direct indications to an absolutely different site where
these dramatic events took place.
In particular the site of the event is directly indicated in the English version
of the Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians (Gal.3,1). It runs as follows: «O, Foolish Galatians`, who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey
the truth, before whose eyes Christ was exhibited with all evidence, crucified
among you?» And in Greek: «Γαλαται... κατ∆ οφταλμουı Ιησουı Χριστοı
προεγραφη εσταυρωμενοı...»« in word for word translation reads as follows:
«The Galatians, it was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was persecuted legally for his convictions being crucified». In other words it was the Galatians
who were the witnesses to the last sufferings of Christ, and his crucifixion
took place among the Galatians, before their eyes.
We’d like to remind you that the Galatians lived not only in Galatia – an
area in Asia Minor, to the South of Constantinople (Czar city), i.e. the present Istanbul, but in the Dardanelles (Galipolis, today Gelibolu) and in the region
of Galatz town, i.e. Romanian Galati, and not at all in Palestine (compare:
Galatasaray, a Golden palace in Instanbul).

Propagation des Gaulois – Galates – Galiches selon les chroniques allemandes
du the 17th siècle)
The natural center of the region for the Galatians habitation was in the
Bosphorus, no matter what it is called: Czar-city, Constantinople or Istanbul.
Czar-city and its bald mountain Beykoz, described in particular by N.Gogol
and M.Bulgakov in his novel «Master and Margarita» – that is the place of
the great tragedy, across Gul Gata, which in Swedish means «Golden
Gates», the place which became Calvary for Jesus Christ. (By the way,
there is also a gigantic tomb in which, as believed, Old Testament Jesus,
Son of Nun, was buried, who, as per Western-European versions of the
New Testament, is simply called Jesus). So, according to the examined
phrase from the Gospel, Christ was crucified by the Israelite Galatians in
Constantinople and not in the present Jerusalem. (More details can be
found in books by G.Nosovsky and A.Fomenko, for example,
«Reconstruction of the World history», M., FID «Business express», 1999).
In Russian Orthodox version the quotation from the above mentioned
epistle is altered as per the analogy with Catholic Gospel, for example, with
the French: «...Galates ... aux yeux de qui Jesus-Christ a ete peint comme
crucifie?», which literally means «Galatians, ... before your eyes Christ
was depicted as crucified». Vice versa, in German protestant version
«Galater ... denen doch Jesus Christus vor die Augen gemalt war als der
Gekreuzigte?» the word als hardly can be translated as «as if», and the
meaning of this quotation is very clear: «Galatians, ... before your eyes as
if on the palm of your hand there was crucified Christ ». More over, English
word painted should correspond both to German gemalt and to French
peint – painted with colors.



351
«Painted» Christ most probably for the
first time appeared in the wording of the
the 17th century. In French wording (i.e.
in the wording of the Galls-Galatians) the
word peint was inserted to substitute the
original peine «suffered, experienced
pain», which immediately makes the
French version a completely adequate to
the Greek one: «...before your eyes Christ
suffered when he was crucified»!
Similarly in modern Russian translation
the meaning of the phrase from the Gospel
was altered: Niconian translators divided
one original Greek word «proaegraphe»
(he was prosecuted for his ideas») into two:
«pro» (fore) and «aegraphe» (was
inscribed) from which quite roughly a
contemporary «predesigned», «prede
stined» was made up. As the contradiction
to the original version was too evident in
Russian, later on a vague explanation
appeared that supposedly it was a brilliant
sermon of Paul the Apostle that depicted
such a «vivid» picture of the Crucifixion
before the Galatians that they sensed the
last sufferings of Christ as if it was
happening before their eyes.
It is not by chance that Galatia is
mentioned as the site for Christ Crucifixion
in Paul’s the Apostle’s epistle and not
mentioned by other Evangelists. Paul the
Apostle is a key figure in the formation of
the institution of the Church. He, in fact, is
the first Father of the Church. It was him
who in his canonized later letters
formulated the legal norms of Church life
on behalf of Christ.
What do we learn about his biography
from the Gospel? An Israelite Saul by
name was born in Tarsus, a contemporary
Mediterranean port of Tarsus in the South
of Turkey and was brought up by the
learned Pharisee scientist Gamaliel
(i.e.Gift of God in Hebrew, Theodore in
Greek). (We note that «Hebrew» name
Saul in Lithuanian means «sunny», i.e.
Saul – the red-haired). Saul actively
persecuted the disciples of crucified Jesus
and those who sympathized with them, for
example, he participated in the execution



352
of St.Stephen the martyr and was given
his clothes in award. Then it was dawned
upon him on his way to Damascus and
after that he was baptized and became
the first proselyte, an ardent advocate of
new religion and not only among the
Israelites, but also among the pagans.
A miraculous transfiguration of Saul by
Christ is testified, besides his own
declarations, by mentioning «a secret
disciple» Anania with whose help Christ
returned to Saul the ability to see. Saul
got a shock when it dawned upon him.
Due to that Saul is not only a «secondary»
Apostle, who appeared after Christ was
crucified and who was not among the
«first» disciples of Christ, but he was the
first canonized self-appointed Apostle,
because previously only those could
become secondary apostles since the
time of Christ Crucifixion, who had been
ordained by Christ disciples – by the first
Apostles.
From the Acts of the Apostles we can
see, that many Christians who were the
contemporaries of Saul, did not recognize
him as a true Apostle and that saddened him. In attempts to persuade
them he would say that he died being co-crucified with Christ and after that
Christ himself became implanted in his body. By that he placed himself
higher than the First Apostles, and not only appropriated the right to act on
behalf of Christ, but to represent Christ reincarnated by himself and to be
a messiah. In fact it was the beginning of a new, Pauline church.
The story of how he became Paul instead of Saul is incomprehensible.
Let’s begin with the name Paul. One comes across this name for the first
time in the Acts of the Apostles written by the Roman pro-consul Sergius
Paulus, who allegedly was converted into Christianity by Saul. But open the
comments to the Bible which read as follows: The name Paul is Greek, from
«paulos», which supposedly means «insignificant». At the same time there
is no and has never been such a word in the Greek language. That is why
encyclopaedia has to trace its etymology from the Latin paulus. However
this word is also doubtful, because «minor» in Latin derives from paucus
(hence, for example, Italian poco), and only from this word a diminutive
pauculus (= small, compare with Italianpiccolo) could derive. Later on, after
reduction of unstressed syllable, a Latin wordpaulo, — a little was recorded.
Only after that a wordpauluscould be formed, This indicates to the medieval
origin of the name Paul.
Moreover. There is a Greek verb poulo which means «to betray, to commit
treason». That’s why poulosin Greek meant betrayer, traitor, and that is
how Saul-Paul could be called both by the persecutors of the Christians,
the orthodox Israelite-sadducee, whom he betrayed, and by the first Christian



353
Vue actuelle de Stamboul
«Hellenes’ who did not believe in his «transfiguration»! Later Paul together
with his friend and private doctor Luke the Evangelist depicted the First
Apostle Judas as a traitor, hence two Judas appeared in the New Testament:
one was St.Apostle and the other – «Judas who betrayed Christ». It is
typical that Anania .who was the same proselite-pretender («a secret
disciple») and at the same time Judaic first priest) found him in the house
of Judas in order to return Saul his sight.
As far as the story about the conversion of Sergius Paul is concerned
we’d like to add that «the patrimonial Latin» name of « Roman pro-consul»
Sergius» means just a man wearing a sign of a military chief: a ring in the
ear, i.e. ear-ring, like the Cossacks used to wear.`The Russian word serga
(earring), derives from the Baltic and Slavonic roots and means «ring for
the ear» (compare, for example with German Ohrring– earring).
Besides, in the story about pro-consul Paul the story about Saul’s going
blind is repeated – when it dawns upon him by Christ. But this time it is Saul
who sends blindness upon his opponent — the magician in the presence
of pro-consul Paul. By that he persuades the latter of his divine force. After
this episode both the name of Saul and the «pro-consul» Paul disappear
and Paul the Apostle himself appears. (the fact of inconsistency of the
story of the secondary Paul the Apostle with the Acts of the First Apostles
is considered in details in the book by Z.Kossidovsky «The stories of the
Evangelists», M., IPL, 1979).
It is typical that the above mentioned Paul’s the Apostle epistle to the
Galatians says that the NEW testament abolished the law which had existed
for 430 years (Gal.3,17). If to begin New era not from the conventional
date given by the monk St.Dionysius who was canonized only in 1563, but
from the flash of the Star of Bethlehem – the brightest super new star in
1054 in the Taurus constellation (the present Crab-like nebula), and to
consider Christ’s commandments as the first abridged legislation issued
circa 1085 (that is «Old Testament»), then St.Paul’s epistle, (the «secondary»



354
Apostle and the first self-appointed New Testament Apostle) can be dated
not earlier than 1484! It is possible that the Roman Paul the Apostle made an
impact on the traditional history as Roman lawyer Paul, one of the creators of
Institutes (Codex) of Justinianius), whose works became laws supposedly in
426, i.e. (considering a shift by 1054 years) in 1480.
The epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans indicates that he described
the events of the 15th — 16th centuries. In it he informs that he is going to
visit Spain (not Iberia!) – such a name for the first time appears in 1479.
Let us consider now the history of the Roman Popes Pauls by name, as it
also provides a key to understanding of the formation of institution of Church.
Including the the 20th century the Roman Church had six Popes Pauls by
name altogether and two John-Pauls. Pope Paul I supposedly ruled in 757
768 and for the first time was mentioned in the 16th century in the «Book of
Popes» which was «luckily discovered» at that time. All Popes up to the end
of the 10th century were mentioned there and at that it was interrupted.
Nothing important is known about him with the exception of one very
typical circumstance: His activity coincides with the last years of life of the
legendary king of the Franks Pepin the Short and with the first anointment
of the king by Pope (a son of Pepin was Charles the Great). Thus the first
«historical» precedent happened to show the superiority of the spiritual
power over the secular one.
Next Pope Paul (II) enters the history exactly in the second half of the
15th century (supposedly he was in office in 1464-1471). The information
about this Paul is as follows: he belonged to a rich Venetian family, was a
diplomat and traveller. When he arrived in Rome he bought the cardinal hat
there. It caused a great scandal in the religiously tolerant Venice which
was at war with Rome. They wanted to deprive this Paul of citizenship and
to confiscate his family property. However five years later he was elected
Pope and his favorite occupation was putting the heretics to tortures, for
example, in the tortures of Plato academicians he participated personally.
Two next Popes Pauls appear at the most turbulent period of the 16th
century the heretics. Pope Paul III (1534-1550) was the founder of the
institution of the inquisition which legalized Jesuits Order of St.Ignatius of
Loyola. He also convened the well-known Trident Council. Pope Paul IV
(1555-1559) was an ardent persecutor of a written heresy, the initiator of
the «Book auto-da-fe» and a creator of the first «Index Librorum
prohibitorum». He called for burning of all heretic’s books and it made its
impact on the activity of Paul the Apostle who incited the «Ephesians» to
the first «»historical» precedent of books burning.
Pope Paul V (1605-1621) rules at a turbulent time (compare with Time
of Troubles in Russia: from the year of Boris Godunov»s death up to the
final enrooting of the Romanovs in Moscow and reconciliation with with
Poland). This Pope was the counter-reformer who interdicted a disobedient
Venice and intended to begin war against it, but lost and his Jesuits were
driven out of Venice.
Next, quite real Pope Paul VI appears only in the 20th century (1963
1978). He becomes the first democratized Pope of the Catholic Church: in
particular, in 1966 he abolishes the «Index of the prohibited books» which
was introduced by his name-sake — predecessor Paul IV in the 16th century.



355
We assume that the top leaders of the Roman Catholic Church always
knew about the fact that traditional history up to the 17th century was a
fiction. In favor of this suppositions we can say as follows: the predecessor
of Paul VI adopted the name John XIII (1958 – 1963) simultaneously with
the recognition by Rome of the Pope of the Middle Ages «John XIII» as a
pseudo-Pope (the Naples pirate» Baltasar Cossa, who supposedly ruled in
1410-1415). By this the Papal Rome attempted to «clean» its own history
for the last time. However an evident threat of a man-made nuclear
Apocalypse day (Caribbean crisis of 1962) induced the pontificate to radically
democratize the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. It was proclaimed
at the second Vatican council in 1962. The successor of Paul VI united his
reformatory ideas with the ideas of John XIII by his symbolic name John
Paul I. This once again began another , the newest» Papal church. Pope
John-Paul II continued the process of democratization further, repenting in
public for inquisition and denied the out of date dogmas. Should he deny
the «philioque» and the 5 remaining theses, separating the Catholics from
the Orthodox, this, no matter how paradoxically it may seem, could become
the beginning of the end for the Orthodox Church, because if the formal
obstacles for the union with the Catholics disappear, and the Orthodox
hierarchs have always thought that this would jeopardize their own institute
of the Orthodox Church, then no formal obstacles will remain for the reunion
of the Catholics with the Orthodox.
The activity of the Pauls of the Middle Ages, connected with creation of
the institution of the Christian Church made its impact on the phantom
«heresies» which pass one on another and which are united by the strife
for «purification of the Church».
At first they were Paulicians the follows of St.Paul, who appeared nobody
knows where from in Byzantium supposedly 700 years after Paul the Apostle,
but immediately after the legendary Pope Paul I. Their state in Asia Minor,
i.e. the place where the Apostle of the same name acted and where the
Galatians lived, was destroyed by the Byzantines allegedly in 878. One
group of the follows of St.Paul found shelter in Armenia, the other group
moved to the territory of the present Bulgaria and Romania and became
«Bogomils» (Dear to God). After they were defeated by the Byzantines, the
Bogomil heresy moved to the West, to the South of France (i.e.Gaul, Gallia),
where the heretics gradually became the Cathari and then the Albigenses,
who were supposedly defeated by Louis VIII in 1229. At that point in Russia
traditionally the «Golden Horde era» begins, and in Italy there is a Proto
renaissance». A shift upwards beyond the invented 260 years of a «Horde
– Reconquista — Proto-renaissance» brings us directly to the end of the
15th century, in 1489, when the French Louis VIII becomes Charles VIII.
Taking into consideration all mentioned above, we can acknowledge
that the Roman Church, in fact, comes into existence only in the 15th century.
New, secondary Testament canonized as «father the founder» the
secondary Apostle under the name of Paul, who impostured himself as
Paul and began to propagate «on behalf of» Jesus Christ.
Thus, evidently, «a New Testament secondary legislation» appeared in
the beginning of the the 17th century. When approximately 430 years passed
since Christ Crucifixion (in 33 + shift by 1054 years = 1087) i.e. at the time
of the Popes Pauls of the Middle Ages and the Pope Julius II (1503-1513).



356
Julius evidently introduced julian «Christian» calendar alongside with a new
church doctrine worked out with participation of Machiavelli, the founder of
the modern ideology. Simultaneously with the activity of the medieval Pauls
the orthodox Hebrews produced their own «Secondary legislation» which
was referred to as «Old Testament» in the 17th century.
In conclusion we have to do justice to the Bible researches who have
done a tremendous job on «inner self-harmonizing» of the canonized Holy
Scripture. In this work we didn’t cast doubt on the authenticity of this or that
document of the Holy Scripture or of the authorship of these documents.
For an unbiased researcher any source bears information, same as for a
criminalist a forged document is valuble as a source of information no less
than an authentic one.
When, for example, in the «Book of Revelation» we read about the glass,
as transparent as crystal, (Rev.21, 18; 21, 21; 15,2; 4,6), it becomes clear
that the most probable Zodiac date of this book is 1486 because glass,
transparent as chrystal nobody could produce before the middle of the 15th
century. And when in the first Maccabbeean Book of the Old Testament we
read about victories of the Romans in Spain (1st Macc.,8.3) and over the
Galatians (same, 8,2), we again recognize in them familiar events of the
second half of the 15th century. It is significant that the Maccabees Books
are not part of the Hebrew and Orthodox canons, but acknowledged God
spiritual only by the Western Christian Church. And no wonder – in the 1st
Maccabeean book there is Dimitrius who acts in opposition to Judas
Maccabeus, and a defensive union of the Israelites and the Romans (same,
8, 21-30) is described exactly as mentioned in the chronicles a similar union
of Russian princes with Constantinople- Byzantium.
Biblical stories, epos and fairy tales have preserved the wisdom
accumulated by mankind during the last millenium. Speaking about the
Babel, for example, one should imagine that the Bible narrates about an
unheard of before event – a construction not only of a tower in the 11th
12th centuries, but of the first World capital – Czar-city. This is the real fruit
of merging together of the continental Baltic and Slavonic, Turkic, Ugrian
cultures and coastal Hebrew and Hellenic, and of alphabet with hieroglyths,
of paganism with monotheism.
When on the 4 of July 1054 over the pagan Czar-city the Star of
Bethlehem flashed, the witnesses received not only visual but also a X-Ray
shock. A genetic mechanism which dreamed before, brought people to the
state of anticipation of further miracles.
And then someone appeared and threw ferment into their flour mash of
which they made their unleavened flat cakes. And the dough rose and
Someone filled their always hungry stomachs. And began to propagate
that it is not allowed to eat each other. And he told them: «You want a
sacrifice – eat bread and take it for my Body, and drink wine, pretending
that it is my Blood».
But the full stomachs murmured something like «Go away while going is
good!». And he wouldn’t stop his sermons. And then ignorant «full
stomachs» seized him and nailed him to the pillory and he died agonizing.
Approximately during the first 300 years since Crucifixion Christian
commandments were of no avail to the majority of people: The starving
ones had other problems, the fed up ones still more so. But when the

plague broke out – then they remembered the sermons of Someone: «Do
not eat each other – you’ll perish!». So slowly other rules on sanitation and
hygiene and everyday behavior were collected, and then they took shape
of different Church canons and of the Holy Scripture.
We’d like to add that M.Bulgakov (as Peter I and many others) believed
that for the first time Russia was baptized by the first disciple of Christ the
Apostle St.Andrew, the First Called not long before St.Vladimir the Red
Sun. That’s why in the novel «Master and Margarita» it is said by Pontius
Pilatus that in the year of 1936 12000 moons passed since Christ Crucifixion,
i.e. 970 years. Evidently he was nearer to the truth than the chronologist
J.Scaliger...
RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM AND RELIGIOUS TOLERATION
Until the 16th century a crescent was solely a military, imperial symbol,
not a Muslim one. It became a Muslim Symbol not earlier than 1603, when sultan Ahmed I made Islam the official religion of the Ottoman Empire. Up
to 1685 on the principal catholic cathedral of Vienna (St. Stephen) there
was not a cross but a crescent with a star: the same as on the modern
Turkish flag. Another featuring example is the identity of Poland and Algeria
marine flags of the middle of the 18th century (a bended arm with a lifted Turkish blade).
Until the 16th century the cross, obviously, was a colonial symbol – the
conquered territories and the population surveyed after plague (both the
dead and the alive) were marked with it. Moreover in some places this
marking had a literal sense of the word: the newborn were cut a cross on
the forehead. Thus this initial listing meaning of the cross (not the Christian
one) was the origin for the tradition of the illiterate signing with a cross. This
custom has survived up to now.



358
STATE SEAL OF IVAN KALITA
In February 2001 G.K. Kasparov attracted our attention to a little-known fact that the
seal of Ivan Kalita (1328) was provided with the Star of David – Jewish symbol. This seal
also has the Buddhist eternity symbol.
A budge «50 years of MPR» with the eternity symbol similar to that on the seal of Ivan
Kalita was issued in 1970.
Times are passing, symbols remain....
It is possible, that the «Star of David» originally was not associated with
«Jews» but with the record-keepers, scholars. The latter were free of military
service and other duties everywhere up to 1453. On the proof face of the
stamp, ascribed to Moscow prince Ivan Kalita on one side there is the
«Star of David» and on the other — the Buddhist eternity symbol. There is
no symbolic cross at all. On the image face of the stamp there is an old
man blessing with two fingers (forefinger and middle finger) forming the
symbol of wisdom. This symbol was the prototype of modern sign «OK»,
but on the stamp the big finger forms a circle with the ring finger instead of
forefinger.
Moscow (Greek Moscha) in the 15th century was, the most probable,
simulta-neously one of the Christian centers and the «city of Moses»
(legendary Russian patriarch Mosoh) and the main Mosque (Mosca).



359
On the medal of the sultan Mehmed II, dated 1481 and made in Italy, there is an
inscription: «S.VLTANI MOHAMMETH OCTHOMANI .VGVLI BIZANTII INPERATORIS».
(The point before V means, that this character is read as vowel U.) The inscription states:
«The sultan Mohammeth the Son of Octhoman (Ogdoman-ogly), Byzantine Emperor».
Octhoman (otherwise, Octavian, Ottoman, Osman, Yesmen, Yazmen, Shmun and etc.)
— Sovereign of the heaven and seven planets (cabirs), i.e. highest, Eighth godhood.
However, this hierarchy belongs not to Islam, but to beliefs of «ancient pagans» Egyptians and Phoenicians. That is the religion of the 15th century.

The proof for absence of modern
Orthodoxy as official religion in Russia of
the pre-Romanov epoch is the following:
the first city that received a biblical name
was the city of Saint Michael the Archangel,
modern Archangelsk This city got its name
with the help of the Stroganovs in 1613 in
honor of the reign of Michael Romanov.
Before this it was called Novye Kholmogory
(founded in 1597). Village names like
Spasskoye (from «Savior»), Rozh
destvenskoye (from «Advent»), Voskre
senskoye (from «Ressurection») etc. – are
all more late. Also the names of Catholic
cities in honor of different saints with
prefixes San-, Santa-, Saint- appear only
from the second half of the 16th century
mainly in the New World. (The only
European exclusion — principality San
Marino said to have held its name from 301
– is artifice. Prefix San- was received not
earlier than in the 15th century).
Religious toleration in the Ottoman
Empire up to the middle of the 17th
century is accepted both by the Catholic
and Orthodox theologists.
The fall of Constantinople in 1453 was
interpreted by Europe as the triumph of
justice and genius of Great Turk – Greek
Sultan, remaining Roman Emperor at the
same time. It is important that right after
the conquest of Constantinople Mehmed
II opened a secular university there. It is
not earlier that in the end of the 17th
century the Turkish conquest of 1453 was
ascribed the massacre of «Moses’
crusaders» over the common people
during their preceding campaign on
Constantinople. In Turkish history this
«Moses’ campaign» was later reflected
as inner war of brothers Musa (= Moses)
and Mehmed (=Mohammed) for the
sultan throne, in which Mehmed having
killed Musa in the battle of 1413 was the
winner.
In 1453 Nikolas Cusanus wrote a
treatise «De pace fidei» where he spoke
of the Turkish and Christian faith unity:
«It is not the question of faith change: you
will see the faith is the same everywhere,
one religion — «religia una» is hidden



361
behind a variety of rituals». In his treatise Mohammed is called a «broken
away Roman cardinal».
Gregory of Trapezondus, one of the most popular writers of the West of
the 16th century along with Aristotle, Agricola and Melanchton, a bright
connoisseur of the world culture and history including the Mohamedan one
calls the mankind to accept Mehmed II, the new Roman Emperor, a regular
Christian as the Head of the Reunited Empire and the Head of the United
Christian Church (tria omnium rerum summa, fidem, ecclesiam, imperium).
In the religious polemics the Mohamedans blame the Catholic Church
for leaving the dogmas of the Christianity (belief not in one God but in the
three – the Trinity, idolatry (icons), God’s son identity with the God).
Generally speaking, Gregory of Trapezondus does not write about the
unity of two religions but of three religions, adding the Judaism to the unity.
The Turks, conquerors of Constantinople, are called Trojans that had
taken back Troy, in the literature of that time. In France the letter of Mehmed
II to Pope Nicolas V was very famous, in which the Roman Emperor Mehmet
II expressed his surprise at the Italians’ reaction at his reign, for they had
the same Trojan roots as the Turks.
Mehmet II Fatih, Emperor of the Roman empire (there are numerous
coins carrying the appropriate text) gained common respect in Europe
(«dominus magnus teucrus»). Various authors of that time – both Latin and
Greek ascribe him unordinary knowledge and true interest for the antiquity.
In the literature of those days he is called a Trojan, an honored follower
of Alexander’s deeds.
The official language Grand Turko was called Greek, but all the office
work was led in two languages – Slavic and Arabic.

(I.P.Medvedev,art.«FallofConstantinopleinGreek-Italian humanjournalismofthe15thcentury»from«Byzantinebetween theWestandEast»SPb,1999,p.293).
An actual not legendary papal activity in Rome (Vatican History) takes
start only in 1377 after the «pope arrest of Avignon» and the period of
multi-papacity. For the first time the question about ecclesiastical schism
was raised on the Basel Council of 1431 after Hussites defeat. Moreover
there is no mentioning about any preceding schism in the documents of this Council, particularly about the «Great Schism» of 1054. This schism
was totally unknown up to the Trident Council (the middle of the 16th) and
adoption of the chronology from the Advent (first in Spain in 1556).
Henry VIII created his own Anglican Church in 1531. In Moscow the first
real own patriarch (Job) appeared in 1589 by efforts of tsar Boris. The notion of «orthodox tsar» went into use after 1613 under Romanovs’ reign.
Islam became the official religion of the Ottoman Empire (keeping toleration
towards the other confessions) only in 1603 under the reign of Ahmed I.
A clear example for happy neighboring of crescent, cross, Star of David
even in the end of the 18th century is particularly the Emblem of Ukrainian city Konotop, confirmed by Catherine II in 1782.

UNIVERSITIES AND RELIGION
Traditionally there is an opinion that only church institutions- monasteries,
later-universities were the center of education and science of the medieval
Europe. Russian Orthodox Church claims that only thanks to the Greek
scholars of orthodox cloister and through the church Slavonic language
ancient Russian culture survived during the «Tartar Yoke». If we compare
the real history of European education and educational institutions we would
get one more methodological clue to define the correct chronological order
of our civilization.
The main idea is that the beginning of the establishment for public
education and the science of law in the 13th — 15th centuries and their
formation in the 15th — 16th centuries were used by the priests-monotheists
in order to propagandize their convictions and beliefs among the pagans,
to appropriate public property, to make missionary centers out of the
educational establishment and to form church establishments .
Let’s look through the list of the oldest universities. The time of their
foundation was the 11th – beginning of the 14th century. The only and the
oldest university in Bologna (North Italy) supposedly existed in the 11th
century. In the 12th (the beginning of the 13th century according to other
sources) universities appeared in Oxford (England), and Reggio (Italy).Then
in the beginning of the 13th century universities supposedly appeared in
Vicenza (Italy, 1204), Cambridge (1209), Paris (1215), Palencia (1211) and
Salamanca (1218 , Leon Kingdom, Spain later), Padova (Italy, 1222), Naples
(1224), Vercelli (Italy,1228), Valencia (Spain,1246) Siena (Italy,1246 or
1357) and Sevilla (Spain, 1256). The second French university in Toulouse
was established either in 1229 or 1233, or in the 13th century according to
the Vatican saucers. (The same we can say about the university in Montpelier
(France) some soucers affirm it has been known since the 12th century,
other – since 1289). Then universities appeared in Lisbon ( in 1288 according
to the facts from «The history of the Portuguese language» M., «Vyschaya
shkola»,1988, by E.M.Volph, and in 1290 according to the encyclopaedia.)
in Rome and Avignon (1303), in Perugia (1308), Orleans (1309), Dublin
(1312), Treviso (1318), Florence (1321), Cahor (1332), Grenoble and
Verona (1339), Pisa (1343), Valladolid(1346).
Let’s mention the fact that geographical location of the universities in
that period of time traditionally was confined by England, France, Spain,
Portugal and Italy. The history of the first university in Portugal is quite
vague, it appeared practically after «Portugal had been fought back from
the Moors», then it was transferred to Coimbra in 1308, and later-back to
Lisbon. But they consider the University in Coimbra to be established in
1537 , and the university in Lisbon was revived only in 1911.
The phantom Lisbon university in the 13th — 16th centuries existed
until Portuguese language formed in the middle of the 15th century. That’s
the time the basic language in Portugal was «Galician» i.e. Celtic, i.e. the
Slavonic dialect, which remained in Brazil till the end of the 16th century
being the language of the first migration from Portugal and the language of



363
the Indians tupi-guarani, and was called «Grego» (Corinthian dialect of the
Slavonic language, according to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1771).
The existence of other catholic universities in the 13th century is also a
phantom, that appeared in the traditional historiography in the 16th century
in order to substantiate the struggle between Protestants and the Papacy,
further schism and the formation of the independent Anglican church, and
The Gallican Church, isolated from Rome. In its turn, the papacy in the
17th century referred the beginning of Bologna university, the oldest
university in Europe, to the time of the Christian schism in 1054, that took
place because of the alternative versions in the questions of «The symbol
of Faith», and the Pope’s supremacy over other Patriarchs.
It’s worth mentioning that there was not any reference in the works by
Dante, Petrarch or Boccaccio of the university in Bologna or any other
university from the above mentioned although as the traditional
historiography says they lived in the 13th — 14th centuries.
The fact of the foundation of Oxford and Cambridge in the 13th century
became known only in the 17th century – in connection with the works by
R.Bacon and J.Wicklif as well as the works by F.Bonaventura, whose works
appeared in the end of the 16th century.
To restore the right chronological order of the events we should clarify
the notion «university», that appeared as we can see, not earlier than in the
11th century as well as the other notions connected with education and
religious establishments. Latin word «universus»is usually translated
«universal, general». Modern English words «university», »universe»,»
universal» were derived from the Latin «universus». «Universus»- is a
compound, built of the two parts. «Uni»- means «universal, general», and
«versus»- (translated as « line, rhyme, row, towards) is a derivative from
vere «genius» , vero «really, actually, truly» and veritas «truth». In fact, it’s
the Latin equivalent of Russianveraand Greekairese«convictions, opinions,
points of view, heresy» (compare also to «version»). Consequently, the
Latin notion «university» is an equivalent to Russian notion «common faith».
In other words, the medieval universities appeared in Europe as the meetings
of coreligionists i.e. religious meetings where long sermons or even
advocacies were held to propagate a religious theory from a pulpit (i.e. in
Greek word to word: «the place of a meeting» ). The understanding of the
religious notions by the coreligionists became universal, general i.e., in
Greek, catholic. Hence the meaning of the appearance of the notion
«university» was equal to «Catholicism». That was the Latin equivalent to
Greek monotheism in the 11th — 16th centuries. In other words, neither
the word, nor the notion «common faith» had existed before the 11th century,
as all the people were pagans.
According to Webster’s dictionary the words «university» and «school»
appeared in England only in the 14th century. English history says that the
first «grammar schools» in England were secular. In spite of the fact that
the title «grammar school» was a Greek one, they used Latin and English
for teaching. The Dutch spelling of the English «school» which was a loan
word from Greek, points at the 16th — 17th centuries. In the Western and
Central Europe till the 14th century, as well as within the entire Byzantine
Empire in the 11th — 13th centuries, there were no marks of any universities.



364
Because these religious institutions (meetings of the missionaries
coreligionists) were not necessary: schools- colleges as some secular
educational centers were in function instead. (Greek schole means
«specialized school»; it is cognitive to Russian kholit’«take care of, bring
up», originally to «clean, leak clean»). The notion «academy» in every word
«not a trial» (compare kadi «judge», and also to the academic and
evangelical commandment «judge not least should be judged».) existed to
define the place for public discussions and arguments. The principal
difference between the secular Byzantine notions «school», «academy»,
«lyceum» (i.e. the place of the enlightenment, Greek lykeion, compare to
lightand French lux) and religious Latin notion «university» is quite obvious.
On the other hand the notion of Russian «sobor» (Council) nowdays is
considered to be one of the main difference between the Orthodox and the
Catholic churches. In Greek it is transferred with the word «synagogue». In
every word it means «join education, up bringing». Byzantine monotheism,
derived from pagan religion, included this Judaic-Christian notion.
Turn to the Gospel: «Christ taught in the synagogues using the parables
to explain everything written before him». Neither «Orthodox Church», nor
«Judaism» in the modern meaning apparently had existed before the 14th
century. The most complete Webster’s dictionary claims, that in England
till the 13th century there were no words that carried the meaning «Jew» or
«Hebrew». And the word « Catholic» appeared only in the 14th century,
and the fact proves in details the above statements .
The word «Koran» appeared in English only in the 17th century, although
according to English history the Arabs had been known in England a thousand
years before, as a proof we can draw the fact that Anglo-Saxons used Arabian
coins. We can also see from the traditional history that the oldest Arabic school
– «madrasah» («teaching, up brining», compare also «wise», inveterate) had
existed long before the European universities: for example, one of the largest
«madrasah» in the 12th century in Fez, Morocco. The famous fez (a cap in the
shape of a truncated cone with a tassel) – originally used to be a symbol of
erudition. It became a prototype for the professorial quadrangular cap (i.e.
cruciform) created in the 17th century. It’s worth mentioning that the
«madrasah» were secular and not religious institutions till the 16th century.
For example, the most famous philosopher (supposedly of the 12th
century, called «Aberroes» in Latin and «Ibn-Rusd» or «Ibn-Rushd» (i.e.
son of the Rus, traditionally in 1126-1198) in Arabic, was a pantheist, and
his ideas developed in the 15th — 17th centuries. (In fact the Ibn-Rushd’s
philosophic doctrine is close to Aristotle’s doctrine, apparently appeared at
the end of the 14th — in the middle of the 15th century) The well known
students’ expression «alma mater» (in Latin «feeding mother») – is the
altered Arabic «Al-madrasah».
After the glacier receded, the first settlements in the West Europe were
populated by the migrants from the Eastern Europe.The names of the towns,
for instance «Paris» is cognate to Russian «pricht», English «parish» and
Greek «paroikia», and «Cologne» means «settlement colony». However
till approximately the middle of the 13th century the colonization of Western
Europe by the new-comers from the Southern and Eastern Europe wasn’t
very fast because there was no horse transport and roads.
The first colonists kept their pagan traditions. For example the Celts



365
worshiped their wood gods — druids (i.e. the tree spirit). Nowadays this
cult exists among the Ugro-finnic population of the Volga district. Monotheism
came to the continental Europe in the 14th century with the new wave of
the horse-mounted colonists from the Golden Horde, the heir of Byzantine. To the pagan brotherhoods of the first settlers the new colonists’ assosiations
were added. The new colonists disseminated the monotheistic beliefs further
in the continent in the middle of the century. But there were no Christian
canons at that time.
During the period from the middle of the 14th century till the end of the 15th century arguments about the true faith arouse. To confirm the fact we
can turn attention to the list of the universities, which were founded at that
time «within the Slavonic-Germanic area»: in Prague (1348), in Krakow
(1364), in Vienna (1365), Kulm(1366), Erfurt (1379), Heidelberg (1386),
Cologne (1388), in Buda (189), Würzburg (1402), Leipzig (1409), and Rostock (1419).
Universities of the group were secular establishments, afterwards they
became the centers of Protestantism and were located in the Eastern and
Central Europe, not in the Western Europe.
The foundation of Istanbul university is notable especially because of the date 1453 — just after the Turks conquered Tzar-Grad-Constantinople.
This university was founded by sultan Mehmed II as a secular institution.
To complete the list we should name some more universities from the group:
in Greisswald (1457), Munich (1471), Trier (1473), Uppsala (Sweden) and
Tübingen (1477), Inholstadt (1482) and Copenhagen (1479). Among these universities there were no catholic ones.
On the contrary, some universities of catholic trend, especially the
universities founded within the Roman area in Pavia (1361), Geneva (1365),
Ferrara (1391), Turin (1405), Barcelona (1430), Poitiers (1432), Bordeaux (1441), Catania (1444) and Basel (1460).
However the first originally catholic university was founded in 1508 in Madrid
(Spain). The other catholic universities were the oldest French and Italian
universities referred by the traditional historiography to the 11th — 13th
centuries. In fact they appeared simultaneously with the overseen group of the universities. The oldest university in Bologna in Italy was founded hardly
earlier than the one in Prague – i.e. in the end of the 15th century. That’s
approximately 260 years later than the traditional date. (These 260 years
were the time of the Golden Horde — a fictitious period of the «yoke» in the
Eastern Europe and the period of «the Protorenaissance» in the Western Europe. According to the traditional historiography, Bologne had been founded
by «boyi» — people from Bohemia — Czechia 1800 years before. In the
beginning of the 15th century, after theauto-da-feover Jan Hus and Jerome
of Prague, the university of Prague also became a catholic center. In 1431
the council of Basel for the fist time took a decision on the appointment of theologists on the sermons in the cathedrals. Universities in Paris and
Toulouse are likely to have been founded in the end of the 15th century
(approximately 1475-1500). As for the universities in Rome, Florence, and
Portugal (Coimbra, 1537) they were founded in the beginning of the 16th
century, after the one in Madrid- i.e. at the time of the militant Catholicism.



366
In the poverty-ridden, ignorant, brought to ruin by the intestine of the
«100 years war» England universities technically couldn’t appear at
Cambridge or Oxford till the Tudors came to power in 1485.
According to Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1771, the Latin type appeared
in England when William Rufus (the Red), William of Orange’s (also Red)
son, in 1091 turned down Gothic type, created by Wulfila (supposedly in
the 11th century). But in the 18th century the Encyclopaedia Britannica
didn’t distinguish the Gothic type, nowadays concerned to be a variant of
the Latin type, and «the Gothic Wulfila’s type», based on the Greek «uncial».
As the «Norman conquest of England in 1066» reflects Henry Tudor’s landing
in 1485, the introduction of «the Latin type «in England in 1091 points at
1510 being the date when the Latin showed up on the British Isles. That
event coincided with the reform of Henry VIII, who rejected everything Welsh
(i. e.«Valachian»), so beloved by his father Henry Tudor («Henry VII»),
who died in 1509. Therefore Oxford and Cambridge are likely to have
appeared in the reign of Henry VIII in 1510 —1540. These were average
protestant universities, analogous to the university in Marburg (Germany)
established in 1527.
The beginning of teaching at the universities was closely connected to
the fact that the Latin language and the Roman alphabet appeared – an
artificial language, probably created by Stephen of Perm (1345-1396) in
the end of the 14th century for the Western Europe.They were created on
the basis of the Lithuanian dialect of the common European language (Baltic
Slavonic) and so called «western-greek language», i.e. south-western dialect
of the Greco-Roman variant of the Roman European language.
Approximately till 1400 (before the Czech emperor Vaclav IV was dethroned
by the Kurfürsts) in Prague, Krakow and Vienna, they taught in the Slavonic
language and only in 1400 the Slavonic language was replaced by Latin. In
Heidelberg (i.e. since 1386) they began teaching in Latin. This time coincided
with the period of Stephen of Perm’s «enlightning activity» in 1380-1390.
The legendary «Komi alphabet», created by Stephen was the Roman
alphabet for the Hungarians i.e. «ugro-komi» — the new-comers from the
Volga district to Central Europe.
In the second half of the 16th the papacy kept spreading over — the
universities in Krakow and Vienna became catholic centers. Catholic
universities were founded also in Leyden (1575, Germany), Vilnius (Poland,
1579) and Edinburgh (Scotland, 1583). One of the «key» notions for
universities «professor» appeared only in the 16th century (in Oxford). In
Greek this word means «teacher», in Latin it also means «confessing,
drawing the faith», therefore, «professor-theologist» of the 13th — 15th
centuries, is a fiction of the 16th — 17th centuries.
In the 15th century simultaneously with the universities in both the Western
and Eastern Europe corporation brotherhoods arose, for instance in Lvov
(1439) and Vilnius (1458). In the end of the 16th — beginning of the 17th
centuries these specialized, professional unions transformed into religious
orthodox brotherhoods: in Lvov (1586), Kiev (1615), Lutsk (1634), etc. That
is the origin, the beginning of the modern Orthodoxy — the brotherhoods
opened orthodox schools and printing-works. With their help artificial chirch
Slavonic language and the written language replaced «the civil alphabet».



367
Thus by the middle of the 17th century the formation of the main variants
of Christianity-Catholicism, Protestantism and Orthodoxy had been
accomplished. An euphonic but meaningless Russian term pravoslaviye
«orthodoxy» was made up by Philaret Romanov — it was a false, artificial
loan-translation from Greek orthodoxi — «true belief». But the first
Romanovs, who created their own church had to get rid of other true believers
— Moslems, because an analogous process took place in the Ottoman
Empire. There within the system of «madrasah» modern Islam was being
formed – which became the official religion of Turkey only since 1603. The
origin of Mohammedanism apparently was connected with the struggle of
two brothers — Musa (Moses) and Mehmed (Mohammad). Tamerlane
divided the legacy of the sultan Bayesid whom he had defeated between
the two brothers.
In 1413 Musa was defeated and then he was executed, and Mehmed
became sultan in 1413-1421. Hence Islam began not in 622 but
approximately 800 years later. It is the difference between the general
European «Scaliger’s» shift (1053 years) and «the Golden Horde’s yoke»
(260 years), but no doubt you would not find a word about it in the traditional
history of Islam.
Meanwhile the Byzantine synagoguei.e. the rest of the former general
monotheism in the 16th century kept their functions of the control over the
population and the property, i.e. loan banks and pay-centers. It is not a
coincidence that in Greek «ledger» is still called «catholicon», i.e. «the
book of general survey».
Only in the end of the 17th century because of the constant influence of
the potent national religions the modern form of Judaism was accomplished,
and there was no place left for localization of it after the allotment of the
world. At that time Judaic school-hedder-appeared. Boys were taught the
basis of Judaism there.
The followers of Byzantine early Monotheism from different tribes and
peoples turned into the everywhere persecuted Jews, but did not become
a nation, without their own State insitutions. That is the tragedy and glory of
the Jewish people. They inherited the traditions of the Byzantine Empire.
Some «Judaic-Hellenic» adherents of the Byzantine monotheism adopted
Christianity – Marranos, Morisco and other converted people, modern
orthodox Greeks, Romanians in the Western and Central Europe, and
also the Armenians and Georgians in the Eastern and Southern Europe.
FORMATION OF EDUCATION AND JURISPRUDENCE
The key figure of a civilization is the Teacher. First of all it is the first
teacher, who gives a new generation basic knowledge. Originally knowledge
from the teacher to the pupil was transmitted orally, and crafts — by visual
training. In the 12th century with the appearance of the alphabet, with the development of productive forces and division of labour in the Byzantine
empire the first schools — centers of education appear. However, education
becomes wide spread only in times of the development of the horse transport
and overland communications not earlier than the 14th century. According



368
to Webster’s dictionary, the term «education» comes up only in the 16th
century: for example, in the English language the word education for the
first time is noted in 1531. The basic contents of general education up to
the 15th century: writing, eloquence and legal problems. (The elements of exact sciences start to be taught only in the 15th century.)
The art of writing was not only a symbol of literacy — the skill to write a
name was a certificate of a personal freedom and possession of a property.
The ethymology directly testifies it: from all-European wordname— Russian
imya, Greek onoma were derived Russian imeniye (manor, property), Lithuanian namashome (originally — manor), Greek nomos(possession)
etc. It is important, that the introduction in second half of the 16th century in
England of the «correct» English language was conducted by Dragonian
measures: in particular, the person, who could not write his name in a new
fashion (i.e. in English, instead of the customary earlier language!) lost all property rights, and at proceedings could lose even personal liberty. A
person, who could not write his name was to write a cross (X) — this
character for the registration of living and dead, appeared for the first time
in history of a civilization, when Horde had conducted population census at
the end of the 14th century after the first epidemy of a plague (middle of the 14th). Originally violent «baptism by water», i.e. in Greek, Baptism means
«bathing», was introduced in the second half of the 14th century as the
antiplague sanitarian norm, but not as «religious sacrament». This is the
beginning of the famous Russian, Turkish and Finnish (not Western
European!) baths, and introduction of elementary washing into the everyday life the wild Western Europe.
The eloquence (rhetoric), may be considered as earliest subject of
teaching, as in absence of alphabetical writing it was necessary for trouble
shooting during court examinations by explanation of the meaning of the hieroglyphs. Thus paganism was an objective difficulty for the development
of the uniform solutions of legal problems, as if one swore by Jove, another
— Zeus, the third — Nemesis, the fourth — Svarog and etc., it was
impossible to determine, whose swearing «was stronger».
The appearance of The Sole God is the birth of arbitration tribunal. The appearance of jurisprudence is the birth of the institution of church, institution
of religion. The word «institution» means «establishment, ascertainment», the
word «religion» (lat. religio), which is usually translated as «divine», actually
origins from ligo «unite» and literally means «reunification, association in a new
way». In the English language, according to Webster’s, the word «religion» for the first time is noted in the 13th century, «institute» — in the 14th century, as
well as the word «confession». The word union (Russian unia, Latin unio
appeared only in the 15th century in connection with the Florenceunion.
It is remarkable, that Russian Orthodox Church with its explanation of
the word «testament» as «union of the person with the God» expresses indication to the time of appearance of the New Testament. «Testament»
is translated into all Western-European languages in the same way by the
word «will», i.e. heritage of ancestors. Etymologically completely ungrounded
orthodox sign of equality between «testament» and «union» is a clear
reflection of the appearance of the term «unia» as union. Thereby, the term



369
«New Testament» appeared only in the second half of the 15th century,
that coincides with zodiacal dating of «Apocalypse» in 1486.
In other words, the religion is a new formed, Latin unification of Western
Europe at the end of the 14th century. Former Byzantine («Greek») system of beliefs airese («the faith») by the efforts of the Roman innovators was
turned into a heresy. The Latin calque of this Greek word — credo
acquired a meaning «I believe» at this particular time. (Before that, pagan
term credohad not the meaning of «the system of views, beliefs», but, in
Russian,socrovennoye(secret): compare with Russian words with the same root crov’(blood), otcroveniye(revelation), and English crew— nowadays
«team», originally «blood relatives» etc. It is the highest pagan oath
swearing by blood.) Accordingly, views of Byzantine monotheists received
a title «The Old Testament» not earlier than the second half of the 15th
century, and the Bible itself was formed at the end of the 16th century (the word Bible itself appeared only in the 16th century!) and for the first time
was completely published only in 1613 by James I Stuart in England.
From the traditional historiography it follows, that jurisprudence was
engendered in «Ancient Rome» in priest board of «pontifices», which issued
yearly the legal recommendations. (It is worth mentioning, that the word «board», as well as «college», according to the Webster’s dictionary,
appeared just in the 14th century. Who were these pontifices, numbered, it
is as traditionally considered, from 3 up to 15 persons? Latin «pontifex»
again origins from Greek-Roman dialect of the all-European language and
literally means «position plotter», it is an equivalent of German Herzog («leading the procession»). Thereby, pontifices are the elders of Western
European settlement communities and nothing more. Selected by this board
(and, more correctly, by curia, i.e. by representatives of kins, in Russian
kuren’) main pontifice subsequently turned into the Roman Pope, and it happened only at the end of the 14th century (after Western Europe break
off from Byzantium and sedition, known as «Avignon Papacy»). Before
that, there were no Roman Popes, as well as Roman-Catholic and Greek
Ecumenical churches. In the rest territory of Byzantium the arbitration judges
still were the elders, i.e., patriarchsin Greek. Dispute on «Creed» (about the notorious filioque — whether the Holy
Spirit outgoes from the Son also or only from the Father) is related to this
time. In traditional Russian history there is an interesting reflection of this
dispute as an actual event — Western Europe’s break off from Byzantium.
Ivan Kalita, also known as Presbyter John is, according to E.Benveniste, Hwanah, i.e. individual supreme governor, recognized by everybody,
embodiment of the God Living. And his son, Simeon, who died early from a
plague, had no time to approve his authority, and was not recognized by
Western Europe. Significantly, that the name Simeon (i.e. «Marked» in
Greek) for the first time comes up in Russian history here. This word is related to Russian kamen’(rock, eng.) (earlierkama) having, among other,
a meaning «sign» (recollect in Russian fairy tales and stories a rock on a
cross-road), it is in Greek sema. From here for the first time Simon originates,
becoming in written later Gospels as Apostle Peter, i.e. becoming a stone.
So, apparently, Russian Rock through the Greek dialect also became a



370
Jew, and then a Christian Simon — in the 14th century, from whom the
Romanovs’ historiographs created Simeon The Proud. It is important, that
to the converted Tartars in the 16th century Romanovs’ hack writers assigned
names «in baptism» Simeon (Bekbulatovich and etc.) and Peter («Tsarevich of Kazan»)! This indicates once more, that «orthodox church» as a term
appeared only at the end of the 16th — beginning of the 17th century and
not earlier.
«Greeecification» of Russian history, invented in the 17th century, let to a
number of funny cases with ridiculous results. For example, there appeared a famous figure of the 15th century Dmitry «Shemyaka», this name became
soon known as a common noun. The nickname «Shemyaka» is even more
fantastic, than Pushkin’s Shemahan Empress. Sounding as quite in Russian
the word «Shemyaka» nevertheless has no Russian etymological roots,
wherefore this is a reduced to Russian transcription of Greeksymmacho, i.e. simply «ally»! This person, originally an ally of Vasily II, appeared to be
perfidious and subsequently captured and blinded him. The rough activity of
the rebel «Shemyaka» produced a lot of noise all over Europe. The traditional
history states, that eventually even sympathizing to him «Novgorod citizens
could not withstand it and poisoned him, acting by general agreement». This good news was delivered to Vasily The Dark by a courier with name «Beda».
He was made a scribe at once and galloped away to spread the news over
Europe. It is important, that the name «Beda» appeared in history only once
more – it is alleged, that in history of England there was a scribe Bede the
Venerable, legendary first English historian of the 8th century. Formation of jurisprudence is one of the key moments of the history of the
14th — 16th centuries. The first world-wide legal term was the word Horde,
meaning «order» (compare, for example, with Iranian arta). The priests
«pontifices» on the territory of Western Europe operated public property of the Byzantine empire. In Northern Africa (for example, in Tunis and Algeria)
the similar functions were executed by dei (modern analogue — executive
director). After Western Europe break off from Byzantium «pontifices» started
to appropriate public property, by calling it «God’s», i.e. again dei. The Main
pontifice, becoming the Roman Pope also assigned to himself the right to dispose on behalf of the God a quite concrete property. The institution of
church arose as legal board for grounding the legality of appropriation of
public property. It was reflected in Latin iudeo «I judge», whence originate
both words «Jew» and legendary «Judaea» — i.e. Western Europe of the
end of the 14th century, on the contrary to the rest of Byzantium – «Israel», i.e. «belonging to the Orthodox world».
Global war between «Judaea» and «Israel» which had burst at the end
of the 14th century was related in European history as «rebellion» of Wat
Tyler in England and «ciompi» in Italy, the battle on Kossovo Field in
Yugoslavia, revolt of «biblical» Zealots (!) in Greece, «Kulikovo and Grunwald battles» in Russian history, wars of the «Taborites» in Czechia, etc. Bands
of the mercenaries – raiders from Western Europe, who left over the Horde’s
subordination, were turned in the traditional history into «knights-crusaders».
Ideological inspirers of these bands — «curials» — in traditional
historiography were turned into the numerous «Charles-kings». French



371
history became so confused, that it alleges, that for the first time in history
two Charles-twins have appeared at once: Charles the «Great» and killed
by him his brother Charlemagne. However «latinized» Charles the Great
(Carolus Magnus) and his «Frenchified» brother Charlemagne (Charlemagne, i.e. also Charles the Great) are the same, analogues of not
less legendary Romulus and Remus, Ascold and Dir etc.
As for the Greek-Roman terms, determining the law, they were brilliantly
studied by E.Benveniste. In Latin version termius«natural law» is opposed
to term fas «the divine right» (from here, by the way, originates modern concepts de jure and de facto). The word iushas the same root with Russian
yestestvo (that is Nature). The initial meaning of fas was «already
accomplished, made». By the Roman lawyers of the 15th century it was
substituted with «God-given» by analogy with Greek themis.
Although themis according to A. Benvenist meant simply «intrafamily law», as got from time immemorial, it turned into «God-given» in the 14th.
Another Greek term dike, i.e. «indicated», reflecting «family law», was
converted by the same Roman lawyers into Latin dico(through «I direct
I speak «), i.e. «uttered» law, i.e. papal dictat. The famous Code of
Justinianus (i.e. «Fair»), «dscovered» only in 1501, as well as all codification of Justianus, is a university product, product of activity of the lawyers of the
15th — 16th centuries, instead of alleged the 5th — 6th centuries! The
secular term «divide and dominate» in 1526 was transformed in Imperial
parliament in Speier into a legal formula: «Cuius regio, eius religio», i.e. «
whose board, those religion». However, after Counter-reformation in the 17th century this formula was
exposed inversions for the benefit of church, dominant in the given country:
«If you want to dominate — accept our faith». And in the 18th century many
pretenders for European domination without any care in regard of God followed the example of Henry of Navarra (Henri IV of Bourbon) and changed
religion orientation for the power...
Napoleon Bonaparte, as a matter of fact, an atheist, spoke: «to dominate
over France I have become a Roman catholic, to take possession of Egypt
– a Muslim. If I should dominate over the Jews, I would have built up a new Temple of Solomon».
He is one of the few gentiles — heroes of the Jewish people, as it was
he, who for the first time in the history organized a World-wide Zionist
Congress in 1807.
Since then «the ancient Jews» were finally legitimated — by the secular power in the person of Napoleon.
A few researchers pay attention to the fact, that Napoleon in 1812 actually
repeated from the west the foundation of Unified Empire, which had earlier
been founded from the east. In 1812 Napoleon simultaneously deleted the
Mameluke dynasty in Egypt and captured Moscow. Only being in exile at St. Helena Island Napoleon understood his mistake – he was waiting for
keys of Moscow in vain, because there were no reasons to bring them. If
Napoleon had declared in Moscow approximately the following: 1) that he
decrowns Alexander I as the patricide; 2) that he in general decrowns the
Romanovs as the impostors; 2) that he turns into Orthodoxy; 3) that he is



372
the successor of Ruriks and according to the law becomes Russian Emperor;
4) that Moscow will be capital, and other states — provinces of the Empire
and 5) that Cossack republics will take back their former rights in the frame
of Empire, he would have all chances to be recognized in Russia, hence in
the world, as there was nobody to war against integrated Russian-French
army. But Napoleon did not know Russian...
INSTITUTION OF CHURCH – THE PRODUCT OF DEVELOPMENT
OF THE CAPITALIST RELATIONS
The Byzantine empire in the 12th — 13th centuries and its successor the
Golden Horde in the 14th — 15th centuries were notable not only for their
toleration — just in that epoch the concept of national education, secular, not
religious education appeared. It is important to mention, that up to the 14th century in Byzantium people did not know Latin, and in Rome — Greek,
therefore their representatives communicated among themselves at religious
disputes in Slavonic. In the 14th century the priests — monotheists
monopolized education, using the liturgical languages, invented for it: at first
Greek, then Latin, and Church Slavonic. And up to the 18th century the institutions of Roman Catholic and Orthodox church in every possible way
hindered national education, including religious (for example, prohibited to
laymen to read church books). A lot of books and documents relating culture
and history of the civilization up to the 17th century were deleted at this
particular time. A fine manual for independent research in the history of Christianity is
the book of a Russian foreign historian of church N.N.Voyeykov «Church,
Russia and Rome» (Minsk, publishing house Beams of Sofia, 2000). Written
from evidently monarchic-orthodox positions, this book, nevertheless,
contains vast factual material, earlier not published in Russia (including from archives of Vatican), testifying numerous falsifyings in the traditional
history and chronology. In the above book very remarkable facts from
Russian history are mentioned also. For example, speaking about long
resistance to baptism of the pagans – Vyatiches(i.e. Slavic population of
Russian Central Chernozem region), the writer cites data that the inhabitants of Mochensk were finally baptized only in the 15th century! Only this
statement crosses out parts of traditional history of Kiev Russia, as in the
15th Mochensk was in the structure of a really existing pagan Vorotyn’
principality and not in the structure of a phantomic Chernigov principality,
referred in traditional historiography back just by 260 years of the invented «Tartar-Mongolian Yoke».
One more important aspect, described by N.N.Voyeykov, is the toleration
of Turk-Ottomans in contrast with militant catholicism in the 15th — 17th
centuries. The Arabs toleration attitude towards the gentiles, in particular,
in the territory, controlled by them, of present Spain, Portugal and Egypt, in Malta and in Sicily and etc is also well known. It is Golden Horde’s toleration,
typical as well for East Europe, and Siberia inherited by the Horde in the
14th century from Byzantium.



373
Toleration is the key moment of education and initial oral education,
bound with concepts of good and evil. The child imbibes concrete kindness
with milk of the mother before concrete evil, with which one he subsequently
collides in an ambient reality. For a child the mother (the first wet-nurse and defender) — is originally unique concrete and gratuitous kindness, which
one can easily oppose to any external manifestation of concrete evil.
Ungratuitous concrete kindness is comprehended only through work, and
for this purpose the person should be trained to work. People get used very
fast to concrete good, and the sudden disappearance of customary concrete good is accepted as a concrete evil. Therefore in practice the person very
seldom generalizes concrete kindness, especially up to infinity, while the
life experience teaches rather fast to be afraid of abstract evil, and, therefore
to recognize its existence. That is the reason why a person becoming older
comes earlier to the concept of abstract evil, than to the concept of abstract good. Many people have no time to realize at all abstract kindness during
all their life, as well as the sense of the phrase «life is invaluable gift».
Therefore recognition by the person of the God-Creator happens through
contradiction — through the contrasting concrete good and concrete evil,
and only then, after generalization of concrete evil and its abstraction, through contrasting abstract evil and abstract good, i.e. the god, emanating
the good.
Any religious institution, as a matter of fact, is an intermediary organization
between real and virtual, its activity is in substitution of concrete good by
abstract and, vice-versa, abstract evil (devil, evil spirit) – by concrete. For the implementation of this substitution it was indispensable for church, as
an institution to obtain monopoly on education and the propagation of some
religious «solely true» ideas. Thus, church institutions in the 15th — 17th
centuries developed the first PR methodology of the civilization, as it was figuratively expressed by Ilf and Petrov — «opium for the people».
«Authorized activity» of church as intermediary organization (i.e. the
doctrine defined by tenets and canons) is in rendering of services to the
clients (i.e. congregation) on comfort and saving soul in the real world and,
thereby, maintenance of the future paradise existence in the virtual world. It seems, that all the main churches of the civilization recognize the one
God — Creator and Almighty. Why don’t the church institutions unite in one
on the basis of this idea? Because the constant enemy’s image – of pagan,
of atheist, in general — gentile, i.e. infidel, as «infidel» is the best rendered
concrete illustration of an abstract evil. And this image is indispensable for any institution of church for implementation of the authorized activity.
Existence of infidels instead of God — here is the fundamental principle of
the doctrine of any church institution. Infidels embody constant action of
abstract evil, they, through concrete evil, force believers to search for
comforts and savings from the intermediary of abstract good, i.e. church. The coexistence of competing churches reveals the market nature of church
institutions (as a matter of fact, broker offices). Papal sale of the indulgences,
sacred relics and simony (trade of positions) in the 15th — 17th centuries
offers already extra dealer services. Thus, the formation of church institutions
is inextricably related with appearance at the end of the 14th century of surplus



374
product and development of the capitalist relations along with servitude,
feudalism and communal system, typical for all civilizations in all times.
The European civilization was formed in the 14th — 16th centuries
through the development of the jurisprudence, aimed at grounding appropriation and re-distribution of surplus product. Jurisprudence generated
also «Judaism», i.e. monotheism as a court of arbitration, and with it both
institutions of modern religions, and first PR centers — medieval colleges
and universities.
In conclusion, one example from the recent history. In the 70ies of the the 20th century in Kelme (Lithuania, former USSR republic) there was
constructed a new spiritual center. In the same building there were placed
a Roman-Catholic church, local committee of the Communist Party and a
recreation centre. The judicious local Lithuanians explained, that it is much
cheaper and more effective, as the building attracted maximum of visitors, who could find there everything they were interested in. It, as a matter of
fact, is a new form of the well known synagogue, where legal board and
university were placed in the 15th century.

386
THE  ́BYZANTINE UNOa ó THE GOLDEN HORDE OF PRESBYTER IOANN KALITA-CALIPH
POPULATION
To restore the real development of civilization in the the 12th — 16th
centuries, it is necessary to clarify who made up the population of the Byzantine
Empire – the Golden Horde, which practically was the global organization of
medieval times. A simple enumeration of peoples and tribes mentioned in
various sources, and inhabiting, according to their authors, Europe and
adjacent regions of Asia and North Africa in ancient and medieval times (i.e.
up to the 17th century AD), will occupy more than one page. The names and
titles of the rulers of these peoples are quite diverse: emperor, konung, caesar,
king, caliph, doge, khan, prince, shah, basileus, duke, sultan etc.
The traditional history of the states created by these peoples is built
according one and the same scheme: left one locality for another locality,
conquered the local aborigines, organized a state at the new place led by
some ruler, lived through a period of flourishing and ...turned into natives
for new conquerors. Thus ancient «ethnoses» appeared and disappeared,
the distorted circles of human civilization changed each other, rising with
difficulty along the Marxian spiral allegedly up to the 17th century, when,
finally, modern nations were formed by the efforts of humanists.
Meanwhile, when Apostle Paul said for of God the All-Mighty «there are
neither Hellenes, nor Hebrews», he did not have in mind Greeks and Jews
as nations, as this is now understood by mass conscience. Hebrews in the
Gospels are the followers of the teaching of Moses, i.e. the monotheists,
and Hellenes are pantheists, i.e. pagans, who accept polytheism. It is
namely as so that they should be opposed, in particular, to Christians and
Muslims. This is not an ethnic, but a religious classification of the population.
As a vivid example pay attention, on the one hand, to the diversity of
ethic types of Jews in present-day Israel, and, on the other hand, to the
spread of these ethnic types among the populations, say, of present-day,
predominantly Christian France. One more example – present-day Poland.
This country is considered to be mono-ethnic (97% of the population are
Poles), monolingual and practically belonging to the same confessions (90%
of the population are Catholics), but the Slavic population of Poland varies
anthropologically and ethnically from conditional «Aryan» to conditional
«Semitic» types.
Any definition of the nation is relative and therefore unsatisfactory. There
is no, for example, «American nation», despite the fact that the population
of that country is united by common citizenship and common spoken English
language.
Sometimes people object that the United States is a young county that
is why a nation can’t have formed there. And what about China then? It has
almost the longest ancient history, and there was no nation and there is no



387
nation. While the notion of the «Chinese people» is more acceptable,
because it synonymously refers to the people inhabiting the territory of the
relevant states, who are their citizens and who have at least one common
language.
Therefore, in the analysis of «ancient» texts it is necessary to detect
thoroughly what community of people and by what characteristic is
designated by a certain word to which the words «people» or «tribe» can
be traditionally applied. And it suddenly becomes clear that the present
day notion of people is not applicable to any of the mentioned «ancient
peoples».
And to what group of people, mentioned among the ancient ones, is the
notion of tribe applicable? In historical sources you can come across such
expressions as «Germanic tribes» (e.g. Angles, Saxons, Franks, Goths
etc.), «Slavic tribes» (e.g. Kriviches, Polyans, Drevlyans, Vyatiches etc.),
«Iberian tribes» (Picts, Basques, Turdetans, Turduls etc.). The common
word «tribes» here has an attribute of «Germanic», «Slavic» and «Iberian»...
But are these notions equivalent in these attributes? Not at all, and now we
will show this.
The first edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, Edinburgh, 1771,
unambiguously tells us that the word German meant even back in the 18th
century «consanguineous, a blood relative», i.e. a fellow tribesman. It had
no present-day meaning of German. Therefore «ancient Germans» are
any community of people abiding by the clan and tribal structure of mutual
relations based on the blood kinship. Any tribe, for example, a Slavic tribe
are the same kind of Germans as Saxons, Suewes, Cymbres etc. In Spanish,
for instance, the word hermano even today means «brother», and hermana
— «sister». (It can be said that the original latinized word germ («embryo»)
contains a general European root, which is also found in the Russian
language, meaning blood).
«Germanic» tribes traditionally comprise, among others, also Goths, who,
according to the Encyclopaedia, became known as inhabitants of Northern
Black Sea Region in the 3rd century AD. However, the area of habitat of
Goths is toponymically determined quite differently: this is southern Sweden
(Goeteborg, Gotenburg, En.Br.), the Island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea
(Gothland), the towns of Gotha and Goettingen in the Upper Saxony. In
other words, the traces of Goths are to be found all over Western and
Southern Europe.
Here the Goths as an acting force appeared in pages of history in
connection with the beginning of degradation of the Roman Empire in the
image of pagans invading across the frontiers of the Empire which had
already officially accepted Christianity. Therefore, in ca. 360 Bishop Wulfila
(Ulfilas, En. Br.) was sent from Egyptian Alexandria to them in order to
convert them to Christianity. Here too, Wulfila also invented a written
language for the illiterate Goths on basis of the Greek script and translated
the Gospel into their language.
This historical novel looks by itself rather awkward at least for two reasons:
1) the pagan name of the native of Egyptian Alexandria, Wulfila, meaning
in German «wolf-cub», for a Christian bishop, i.e. for a man, who has been
given a Christian name only at baptism, and also ordained, is absolutely



388
unthinkable; 2) if, according to traditional history, all other «Germanic» tribes
(the Angles, the Saxons, the Jutes, the Danes, the Franks etc.) used Latin
for writing, then either there was no need of adaptation of the Greek instead
of Latin writing for the Goths, or the Goths spoke a language much closer
to Greek, and not to the language of other Germanic tribes, which is wrong.
In all present-day languages of the Germanic Group the Most High is
indicated by the word which belongs to the general European root g(o)d,
e.g. Engl. God, Germ. Gott. However, Serb. god «holiday», Lith. guodas
«honor, glory, respect», It.godere«be glad», Fr. gaudir etc. go back to pre
Christian pagan times. In German there is such a word as Goetze«idol»,
i.e. as opposed to God (Gott). (It is characteristic that in English the word
God is the opposite of the noteworthy word deuce, which reflects the alien
«Latin» God, e.g.: Lat. Deus, Fr. Dieu, plural Dieux— idols). So the word
Goths should be understood not as some definite tribe, but a pagan
community professing idolatry. Having become Christians (the Moslems,
the Jews etc), the Goths naturally disappear from the historical stage.
Now let us get back to the Gothic language and the Gothic writing. It is
only in the Russian flective language that different words have appeared to
denote «Goth’s» and Gothic. In West European languages there is nothing
of the kind: e.g. the English Gothic means both, just like the German word
gotisch, the Italian word gotico etc. That is why the «Gothic» writing in fact
is not the invention of Wulfila, but the Gothic script denoting Gothic characters
quite correctly.
In the present-day traditional history the «Gothic» script allegedly
disappears in the 10th century, and at that time Gothic Latin comes. In the
18th century En.Br. writes: «...then Latin degenerated into Gothic».
The famous monument of the «Gothic» script, the Gospel, written in
Gothic in the «Greek script» of Wulfila and referred to the 6th century AD,
is noted among other manuscripts by the technology of writing, because
this manuscript was written in silver, that is why it is called the Codex
Argenti.
The Material science and the history of chemistry make it possible to
assert that the only method of silver script is to write a text with the help of
silver nitrate solution with a subsequent reduction of silver by water solution
of formaldehyde under certain conditions. Silver nitrate was first discovered
by an outstanding chemist, Johann Glauber in 1648-1660. He was also the
first to carry out the so-called reaction of «silver mirror» between water
solution of silver nitrate and «formic spirit», i.e. formalin – water solution of
formaldehyde. By the way, nobody knew anything about aldehydes as a
class of chemical combinations at that time, and «formic spirit» was obtained
as infusion from ants. Therefore it is quite normal that the Codex Argenti
was «discovered» by the monk, F.Junius at the Werden Abbey near
Cologne, as it was possible to start its production not earlier than in 1650.
Judging by it all, the name of J.Glauber must be mentioned by right among
the authors of this brilliant artefact now kept at Uppsala (Sweden).
The motives of such unique artefact are also quite understandable:
without it the Habsburgs would have been forced to accept that at least in
the 5th — 10th centuries their forefathers were not only barbarians, but
also Goths-pagans, and not «most Christian Emperors», who had been



389
tracing their clan, according to Cuspinian, from Julius Caesar through
Constantine the Great (the first emperor-Christian).
The Franks are also notable among the «Germanic» tribes, who laid the
beginning of modern West European statehood which emerged on the ruins
of «Ancient Rome». The word «Frank» itself has been well preserved in
the present-day European languages, for example in English «frank» means
«open, sincere», and it also defines the venue accessible to tax-free
commercial operations, for example, franco-port, i.e. open port, i.e. a free
trade zone.
This is the main meaning of the definition «frank» – free for trade. The
territory of the Rhine basin was the zone of free trade in Western Europe,
which later became the Hansean League, and now it is the European
Community. The population of that territory was given the name of «Franks».
It is noteworthy that the administration on that territory was carried out by a
certain Slavic clan of Merovechs (i.e. weight measurers), hence comes the
name of the forefather of the first legendary Frank dynasty of the Merovings,
Merovech Vindelic, i.e. Vandal. The descendant of this Merovech, the first
Frank king Clovis, also Louis I, according to French history, was not only a
Slav, but he tried to introduce Slavic alphabet in his kingdom.
The Teutonssimply means «those who are alien, folk people», cf. Croat.
tuj, Lit.tauta«folk», It.tutti«all», Greektautos«same» etc. Just like Sueves,
Swedes and Swabs mean «of our folk». As it was proved by E. Benveniste,
the Latin word civis means not a citizen but a co-citizen, i.e. again one’s
own. (According to Benveniste, the Greek word «ethnos» is of the same
root, by the way).
To finish with the Germanic tribes, let us mention the Saxons, whose
chieftains, nevertheless, had quite ordinary Slavic names such as Rada,
Hasta, Gora etc., from which, according to English history, the names of
the present-day Readings, Hastings, Gorings etc. originated. The Saxons
themselves were farmers and delved with wooden ploughs (Slav. sokhas),
hence, probably, came their name.
Continental tribes called the Saxons «the Welsh», i.e. «overseas», for
example, in Swedish, välsk. In Russia the present-day inhabitants of
Romania, Italy and other countries of the European Mediterranean Region
were called the Valakhs, also «overseas», who could be reached, in the
absence of horse transport, not by land, but by the sea. Hence it becomes
obvious that the notion «Welsh» meant any overseas inhabitants.
Now let’s turn to the Jews, the Huns and the Tartars. Seemingly, what
could the Jews and the Huns have in common? Nevertheless, both
definitions mean a «mixed people». Even today, there is an international
word hybrid«heterogeneous, mixed», It. ibrido. The Hebrew, also Iberians
are an ethnically mixed population of the medieval Mediterranean Region,
according to Father Alexander Men’, a «Mediterranean race», and not Jews
in the present-day sense of the word.
A mixed (it is believed to be Ugrian-Turk) population of the continental
wooded and steppe zone came to be known as the Huns, cf., for example,
the English hug-mug and Gog-of-Magog. During the colder climatic period
this population was forced to abandon native sites in search of food. Hunger
drove them to the West. Therefore former hungry Huns-Ugrians inhabited
present-day Hungary-Ugria and Baltic Ingria-Vagria.



390
These are the hungry newcomers, if you like, the hungry people of the
Volga Region. Hence in Russian proverb: «A hungry guest is worse than a
Tartarian», i. e. an unexpected newcomer who has startled the host by his
visit is a hungry guest, so, first of all, he should be given food and drink.
Unexpected newcomers — this notion reflects the West European origin
of the Tartar, and also in English to startle means «to perplex». It is
characteristic that the natives of Kazan do not call themselves Tartars, but
Bulgars, i.e. in Russian, the Volga people, and they are quite right.
The Turks appear on the world arena by the standard of traditional history
as practically the last of European peoples.
Now let us speak about the unique community mentioned in ancient
texts, which until now has preserved a nomadic way of life. These are the
gypsies, than means «Egyptian nomads», cf. also Sp. gitanos. They call
themselves «Romalae», i.e. people who are free in time and in space cf.,
e.g., German Raum «space, Universe», English room, and also hour,
German Uhr, Greek eraetc.) — exactly like Romans and Romees (self
name of the Greeks). Therefore «ancient« Romans, gypsies and Greeks
and Romanians – this is simply a community of free peoples, and not serfs.
Speaking about the Hellenes, the meaning of this notion is also rather
transparent – this is a «God-chosen people», the population of the Promised
Land. The word Hellene has the same root as the Jewish word Eloah «God»
and the Arabic Allah. From the ethnic point of view this is also a mixed
population like Jews.
The Antae, the traditional history says – is the name of the association
of Slavic tribes who populated the Northern Black Sea Region before the
beginning of the 7th century (i.e. in the same period as the Goths) and
who were farmers. The Antae, Vents, Veneds and Vandals – these are
phonetic variations of the word expressing one and the same notion: people
who manufacture products and go in for commerce (the so called «blue
people», unlike «red people» – warriors and «white people, — priests).
The ancientculture (Fr. antique) means literally : the culture of Antae.
The Vandals, just like the Goths destroyed nothing in «Ancient Rome»
on the contrary, they together with the Arabs built everything that had existed
in Southern Europe before the 14th century. (By the way, the language of
«the alleged Germans» Vandals, differed very slightly from the present
day Russian language.) It is namely these people who created Venice,
named after them, just like the semi-legendary «Phoenicia».
Noteworthy are also two Greek variants of the name Venice: Benetia
and Enetia. In the first variant the letter B reads like «V» – this is also
evidence of the fact that it has never been read like «B», and is namely the
all-European protetic «v», which is absent in the second variant, cf. also
oscillateand vacillate.
The Slavs is the most common designation of people, observing a certain
social way of life, but not savages. These people were such people with
whom you could do business. They were the carriers of the word (the Greek
logos) i.e. spoke all-European language, which served not only as a means
of communication, but also as a means of storage and transfering of
information, i.e. knowledge.
Initially, these people were glorious (i.e. known) namely by the word that



391
carried knowledge and responsibility for it, and not by military glory won in
battle. The Slavs (i.e. the greater part of Europe’s population, inhabiting it
up to Gibraltar) had to fight seriously later, in the 11th — 14th centuries
with those who were not engaged in productive labour on land, but they
were committing the acts of piracy at sea, rivers along the water ways from
the Don river across the Mediterranean Sea up to the British Isles. The
imprisoned continental inhabitants who spoke the all-European language
(but not Jewish or Hellenic), i.e. the Slavs, were turned into slavery. Hence
come the present-day European words meaning slaves, for instance the
English word «slave» means both «a Slav» and « a serf» (cf. serf which
comes from «Serb», which initially meant «keeper»).
It is very indicative and also proved by E.Benveniste, that the initial
distinction of the Greek words demosand laos, now translated practically
equally: «people, population» took place. The word «demos» means simply
«inhabitants». As for the word «laos» (initially it readlawos), it meant armed
people, and even not simply warriors, but personal guards of the ruler. This
word is related to the name of elite Cossacks troops and characterizes the
method of cavalry fighting: lava.
The results of consideration of some selected names of human
communities that inhabited Europe up to the 15th century quite certainly
points to the interaction and confrontation of the two initially different cultures
in Europe in the 8th — 15th centuries: the continental Balto-Slavic-Germanic
(otherwise: Aryan) and the Mediterranean one (otherwise: Hebraic and
Hellenic). Both the «Roman» South European medieval culture and the
Arab culture were developing at the same time, born exactly during the
same period as a result of crossing of the initially mentioned cultures, and
the Aryan heritage prevailed in the Roman culture and the Hebraic-Hellenic
heritage prevailed in the Arab culture.
And it is quite understandable why «ancient Romans» allegedly replaced
(ousted, conquered etc.) various «tribes» of southern Europe: the legendary
«Ligurians» (i.e. simply «united»), the Illyrians» (i.e. «not united»), etc.
The «Italics», who gave the name to modern Italy, deserve a special
commentary. This term, at a first glance, contains a certain noble beginning:
cf., for example, German edel, English idle, Greek athlos, hence comes
the wordathlete(literally «unbending»), cf. also the nick-name of the leader
of the Huns, a pagan, who was known for his nobleness: Attila. But in fact
this term points to the initial Hebraic-Hellenic idolatry of that community,
i.e. worshipping not God, but an idol. Thus, the Italics are the Hebraic
Hellenic equivalent of the Aryan idolaters, i.e. the Goths.
So this is how the circle of notions applicable to the communities which
made up the «ancient» (as well as the medieval) population of Europe
closes. It now becomes understandable why, for example, «Germanic»
tribes could be Slavs and Jews at the same time . And the European word
«barbarian», meaning «a bearded man», came into being not in connection
with medieval «barbarism», but following the invention of razor, and then
scissors, with the help of which it was possible to separate the shaven and
those whose hair was cut (who symbolized technical progress) from the
rest men, because before this invention all men were apriori bearded, i.e.
barbarians.

Who do we imply today under Germans? In the first place, the inhabitants
of the Germany, and also of Austria, Switzerland and other countries,
speaking present-day German, having in mind a certain conditional «Aryan»
anthropological type of the German speaking population. Likewise, under
Lithuanians we imply in the first place the inhabitants of Lithuania, speaking
modern Lithuanian (and also silently refer them to the conditional «Baltic»
anthropological type). And under Russian we imply we first of all imply the
population of Russia, and also the Russian speaking population of the
neighboring countries, speaking Russian and referring, in our view, to the
conditional «Slavic» anthropological type.
Moreover, this «Arian», «Baltic» or «Slavic» type of a stranger met by
us is practically indiscernible unless he begins to speak. Thus, it is the
language that first of all determines modern nationals distinctions of the
greater part of the population of Eastern Europe, and citizenship comes
second.
But before the 16th century there were no «nations» and «national states»
at all, and the spoken language all over Europe, except the Mediterranean
Region was practically the same, therefore present-day Germans,
Lithuanians and Russians constituted one conditionally-«Aryan» or, if you
like, the Baltic-Slavic people together with the Czechs, Poles, Danes,
Swedes etc.
This people should also include a part of modern Hungarians ( the
descendants of the Baltic-Slavic settlers on the left bank of the Danube),
and a part of Ashkenasi-Jews (cf., for instance, the similar settlement of
Russian Judaists from the village of Ilyinka in Israel) and even a part of
Greeks. This is also evidenced, in particular, in the first edition of the
Encyclopaedia Britannica in 1771. It says that the «Hungarian language»
is the same Slavonic language as the «Corinthian» language, i.e. the
language of the inhabitants of the Greek Peloponnesus Peninsula with the
capital in Corinth.
Up to the Napoleonic wars the population of the Peloponnesus Peninsula
spoke the language, practically indistinguishable from modern Macedonian,
i.e. the same Slavic. The present-day Greek language is a marginal new
language, i.e. a mixed language of the former Hebraic-Hellenic population
of the Mediterranean Region, which accepted orthodoxy – it retained only
less than 30% of the Baltic-Slavonic roots, unlike Bulgarian (over 90% of
common roots) and Romanian (over 70%). There was more than one half
of the Baltic-Slavonic roots in the so called «ancient Greek» language (i.e.
the language of the population of Greece of the 14th — 15th centuries,
excluding Macedonia and Peloponnesus). The Turkish language is the same
late medieval new language, as here the Arabic influence turned out to be
stronger due to the adoption of Islam.
Speaking about «Lithuania», in the 14th century it implied practically
not only the entire Baltic Region and Eastern Prussia, but also Poland,
Ukraine, Belorussia and part of Russia, including Smolensk, Ryazan, Kaluga,
Tula and Moscow up to Mytishchi, from where «Vladimir Rus» began. The
Battle of Grünewald of 1410 should be recalled — «native troops» (Poles,
Lithuanians, Swedes and Russians) led by Wladislaw Jagiello fought the
«aliens» then.



393
And the capital city of «Great Lithuania» (Lith. Letuva) was not legendary
Troki (now Trakai), not Kuna (now Kaunas) and not Vilna (now Vilnius),
but, most probably, the town of Ltava, called Poltava since 1430 and until
now. It is namely for that reason that in 1709 Swedish King Karl XII went so
far to the south, disputing the «Lithuanian» legacy from Peter I.
All «ancient Lithuanian» literary monuments were written in the Slavic
alphabet, and not in Latin. It is from «Letuva» that comes the present-day
Russian «a» accented literary dialect (cf., for example, the Lithuanian
Maskava = Moscow) and not the «o» accented Archangel-Vologda-Yaroslavl
dialect, by the way, more ancient, which has preserved the original proto
Slavonic full vocalism.
Now about the medieval Russian. Russians are not only a part of the
Baltic Slavs, speakers of the common language. This is in general all non
urban settled population of not only Eastern, but also Central, and even a
part of South-Western Europe speaking one and the same common (=
Pre-Slavonic) language. And Pushkin’s great «Latin» epigraph to the second
Chapter of «Eugene Onegin» is far from being casual: «O, Rus!» (i.e. literally
from Latin: «O, Village!»), i.e. «O, Rus!». In other words: a Russian is a
muzhik (= a countryman).
Hence comes the latest «Latin» rustic: «village, rural», i.e. Russian, i.e.
from the «Rustey land», as written by archbishop Macarius in the 16th.
The population of all medieval European cities, including present-day
Russian, was mixed. In the 17th — 18th centuries small garrisons were
stationed consisting of servicemen hired in various parts of the Empire.
Dane Harald, the future Norwegian Konung, in particular, was also in the
service of Yaroslav the Wise. The Novgorod Weche (Witan) sent a certain
Lazarus Moiseevich to talk with Prince Tverdislav. So under Russian princes
the Varangians, Greeks, Jews etc. lived in towns.
Let us take a closer look at the medieval notion of «town». The first
«towns» were seasonal camps of nomads, the analog of which today is a
gypsy camp (tabor). The ring-like arranged carts-arbas(cf. Lat. Orbis and
orbita«track from the arba»), serving as a circled defense against robbers,
were the foretype of the town – it is no accident that in the Old Testament
the capital of the Moabites (i.e. nomads, cf. with Engl. mob) was called
Kiriath-Ahrby, now Croatian Zagreb, kiriat = town. It is also known as
legendary Phoenician town-republic Arvad. The same meaning is implied
in the name of Morocco’s capital city Rabat(Arabic «fortified camp»).
Hence come the Latin word urb(i)s, and Moscow Arbatstreet ( a «road
downtown»), i.e. to the Kremlin). Hence come the Roman Popes Urbans
(i.e. «urban») and the dynasty of the «Hungarian» Kings Arpad, allegedly
in 1000-1301, the reflection of the Byzantine rulers in 1204-1453 and their
successors – Russian tsars in 1453-1505 with the Slavic and Byzantine
name of Bela, Istvan (also Stephen), Laszlo (also Vladislav) etc.
The mass urban construction in Europe became technically possible
only in the second half of the 13th century, i.e. approximately two hundred
years after Constantinople and about a hundred years after the first urban
structures of Vladimir Rus — after paving the roads and appearance of
horse transport.
Thus, from the very beginning a town has always been a colony, a new
permanent settlement of former nomads or forced settlers. It was always



394
suitable for urban colonists to choose a location high and not inundate,
often on the bank of a river, so other nomads who came to do the same
and settled nearby were naturally strangers for the town dwellers. The conflict
«town-village» is the continuation of the natural conflict of the subject who
had already occupied a cave with the newly arrived pretender to this abode.
Therefore, it is interesting to read in the Russian chronicle how the troops
of Yuri Dolgoruky besieged Kiev: one part of the troops, the Polovtsy, waded
the Dnieper, and the other part, the Rus, made the crossing in boats.
However, here everything is clear: «Polovtsy» is the cavalry part of the
attacking army, while «Rus» is the infantry.
Speaking about urban dwellers, according to the state of economics of
the 12th century, in any town it was hardly possible to feed even a hundred
horses. Prince’s armed force, his escort of honor, consisted of no more than
20-30 horsemen. The cavalry could only be a movable force of the steppe
and wood-steppeland zone. Therefore the Polovtsy, also referred to as «the
Lithuanians» (because Polotsk had been the capital city of Lithuanian before
Ltava-Poltava, cf. also Hung. paloczok = Polovtsy). Later they were also
refered to as «Tartars», or «pagans» – this is also «Rus», but on horseback!
The Polish history also asserts that the «Polovtsy were robbers, coming
from the Goths (!)»: «Polowcy byli drapiezni ludzie, wyrodkowie od Gottow»
(Chronika tho iesth historya Swiata, Krakow, 1564»).
The «Lay of Igor’s Warfare» also says about the joy of the Goths on the
occasion of the Polovtsy victory. However, there is nothing strange here,
because the word Goths meant «idolaters», and the non-baptized ancestors
of the Poles, Poles-pagans – these were also Polovtsy, whose country was
named Polonia in Latin, i.e. Poland.
Speaking about «Polovtsy» – «robbers», they are among the ancestors
of modern Poles, because the German word schlachten (to kill) has the
same root with the Polish word «Šzlachta», which did not mean «Polish
gentry», but a mounted gang of armed robbers-relatives from a main road,
i.e. from «Šzlach» (cf. with the Swedish slakta = kin and the English
slaughter). By the way, the first road of this kind was the famous commercial
water road «from the Varangians to the Greeks» with the only necessary
dragging from the West Dvina River =Daugava to the Berezina River (a
tributary of the Dnieper), i.e. the shortest way from the Baltic to the Black
Sea – without the traditional Ladoga Lake detour and additional pulling
from the Lovat’ River to the Western Dvina. So the exhausting medieval
«Russian-Lithuanian» and «Russian-Polish» struggle is quite
understandable as struggle of local princes for the control over the most
important commercial routes.
The traditional opinion about Polovtsy as the «Turkic tribes» is wrong,
beause «Polovtsy» is not a tribe in the ethnic sense of the word as there
were enough idolaters both among the «Turkic» and «Germanic» as well
as «Slavic» tribes. The names of the Polovtsy khans mentioned in the
chronicles, eg. Otrok, Gzak (i.e. Cossack) or Konchak are quite Slavic, and
the nick-name of Konchak’s daughter, the wife of Vsevolod ( Igor’s brother)
– Konchakovna — a typical Masovian (Polish) last name of a married
woman. The chronicles also mention «Tartar tsarevich» Masovsha, i.e.
tsarevich from Masovia (a province of present-day Poland).
These were the medieval «Polovtsy» who disappeared into obscurity.



395
The siege of Constantinoplle in 1453. Who are the Turks here?
And here we should remember courageous Mstislav from the «Lay of Igor’s
Warfare», who cut a Polovets with a Russian name Rededya in front of the
«Kasogi regiments», i.e. Adygei = Cherkess, i.e Cossacks.
So the word «Rus» was used to indicate farmers, cattle breeders,
handicraftsmen, monks and mounted (Cossack) troops living beyond the
urban boundary, whereas the present-day word «Russian», which has no
nationalistic sense is a synonym of the old word «Russky» (= «rustic» men
= countrymen).
Rich medieval towns hired guards from «Rus», preferably from another
region, without connections with relatives in Rus, i.e. non-urban population:
the Varangians, whom the villagians, i.e. Rus, naturally called their enemies,
also Janissaries = German Junkers, Poles, Khazars = hussars, (i.e.
Hungarians) etc.
As an example of real mutual relations between the peoples inhabiting
the territory of Central Russia, it is possible to give the description of Galician
Vladmimir Rus, referred not to the first half of the 12th century, where it
was placed by the «Catherine’s» edition of the Russian history, but to the
epoch of Ivan III, to the second half of the 15th century, i.e. 260 years later.
In the Russian chronicles a mention is made of the «Bolkhov Land» , whose
inhabitants by voluntary agreement, and not by force, undertook «to sow wheat
and millets for the Tartars». This is what, for example, A.Yakovenko writes in
the «History of the Ukrainian People» (St-Petersburg, Brockhaus-Efron
Publishers, v., pp. 72-73, 1906): «After the Bolkhov people, «sitting behind the
Tartars» other towns or unions of towns are being pulled... We do not see how
the Tartars sent their baskaks to carry out the census in the Volyn and Galicia
land. And if Volyn paid the «Tatarshchina» (the tribute), the Galician Land was
obviously free of it, expressing its dependence only by the obligation to go to
war answering the call of the Khan or his temnik». In other words, the «Galician
Land of the 13th century» indicated the places of settlement of the warriors



396
the Cossacks andstrelets(infantry), i.e. Zaporozhye, the Severskaya Land,
Vorotyn, the Sloboda Okraina and the Savage Field up to the 18th century.
Also the farmers of this region voluntarily gave food to their «Tartar» armed
forcEen.igmatic, independent from all, the «Bolkhov towns» were transferred
by «Catherine’s» history not only in time to the 13th century, but also in
space – to the West beyond the Sluch River, despite the fact that the town of
Bolkhov is located in modern Orlov Gubernia, and Bolokhovo – in Tula
Gubernia, i.e. in Central Russia! And Galicia-Vladimir Rus – from Lvov to
Nizhny Novgorod — all this is Russia-Horde of the 15th — 17th centuries.
And there were really no wars between the Russians and the Tartars in it! (It
is indicative that in the «Catherine’s» edition of history, prolonged from 1240
by 260 years, the Uliches tribes became one more reflection of the independent
«Bolokhov-Vorotyn people» (Galiches) – a union of Slavic tribes of the
allegedly the 10th century, all over the same territory of Galicia!). The medieval
«Tartars», and the «Ukranians», and «Lithuania» – all this is Rus.
To speak Lithuanian means to be a Lithuanian. This Lithuanian proverb
reflects like no other phrase the essence of the national idea, free from
racism, chauvinism, separatism and religious fanaticism generated by the
ideology, policy and political historiography.
The situation, quite similar to the East European, is also observed in the
West European history. For example, also conditional is the division of the
hostile sides as «English» and «French» in the famous «Hundred Years’
War’ of the 14th — 15th centuries. In the recently published monograph
written by R. Caratini, a French historian from Corsica, entitled «Joan of
Arc: from Domremy to Orleans», it is directly asserted that the story of
Joan of Arc, as we know it, has practically nothing in common with historical
truth. In general, nobody besieged Orleans, while the English hired troops
of 5,000 men strong, roamed in the vicinity of the city in search of food,
while in Orleans itself there was not a single French soldier. The entire
«Hundred Years’ War» went on for not more than a week and was an
ordinary, rather petty family strife, and not a national conflict, because the
rulers of the territories of both modern England and modern France were
relatives, belonging to the same Byzantine dynasty of Angels (Anjou).
What nation did those rulers belong to? To the English? To the French?
To the Greek? To the Turkish? They did not belong to any nation – in the
middle of the 15th century there were simply no nations in the present-day
sense of the word.
The events of the «Hundred Year’s War» were clearly invented later,
while writing the national history of England and France at the beginning of
the 17th century. This is a vivid example of the fact how the history of
Western Europe was separated from the medieval Byzantine history which
had been general Eurasian. And it is quite characteristic that the «Hundred
Years’ War» ended immediately after the conquest of Constantinople by
Mehmed II in 1453.
It is interesting that F.Bacon, the trail blazer of the English history, turned
out to be more talented than J.Scaliger, the trail blazer of the French history.
F.Bacon managed to picture England as a country forestalling Western
Europe by 150 years in the civilization: modern history of England dates
back to Henry Tudor, and that of France – only to Louis XIII...



397
RULERS OF THE OECUMENE
Who governed the diverse human communities of which the population
of Europe and the nearby regions of Asia and Africa was made up?
Naturally, in patriarchal clans and communities the leader was the eldest
of the clan; this notion is reflected in the Russian term «kniaz» (from the
pan-European radical «kõ» which means «family») and its Scandinavian
phonetic variation «konung», and later, English «king». It is equivalent to
the nickname-title Carl (Slavonic Kral = king), that sprang from the enlarged
root «kõr»: compare Greek kyros «force», German Kerl «lad», Slavonic
kur «phallus», German, Swedish, Norvegian Herr «mister», English Sir,
Greek kyrios, French Sire; Russian kuriti «make the fire in the fireplace»
Lituanian kurti, Czech kur «smoke», German and Norvegian herd
«fireplace», etc.
The original sense of the titles of a man having administrative power is
clear; he is the chief of the family, the owner of the house and estate that is
reflected in Gothic garda-waldan(compare in Russian: ogorodo-vladelets
«owner of the real estate» — from the same roots that in Gothic!), and in
PersianShah(fromhsay), that is master – compare Englishhouse, German
Haus, Italian casaets.
Very curious and not yet clear is the origin of the title «Sultan» that
towards the end of the 14th century was used instead of the title «Caliph».
(Arabian khalifameans «assistant of the master», it is the equivalent of the
title «Caesar»). It is important to remark that the sultan of the «Porta» (i.e.
Ottoman Empire) bore, up to the middle of the 17th century, among his
titles, that of «king of Portugal». The sovereignity of the Portugal (i.e. region
of Gallia belonging to Porta) up to the middle of the 17th century is very
doubtful in traditional history. InPortuguese(and not in Arabian or Turkish)
suldonosignify «Master of South».
When the number of tribal population grows and expands, a group of
titles of governors appears, that are connected with notions «to lead, know
and show the way», for example German Herzog, meaning «leader of the
procession». The primal sense «show with a finger» is reflected in the later
titles of Venetiandoge, Italian duce(leader), French duc and Russian dyak
(i.e. minister).
The second group of titles is connected to the transmission of orders of
a superior. Spanish reyand French roi(king) are related to Russian word
rechmeaning «explanation, order». The pan-European radicalkõgof such
Russian words as «prikaz» (order), «kazn» (execution, cf. castigate) also
reveals itself in Arab kazi«judge, head of local administration».
The same sense is contained in Greek titlebasileus(basilici– messengers
transmitting the Emperor’s order). An eminent French linguist of the 20th
century, E.Benveniste, proved that the Greek word basileo (from basi
helio, that is, defining the position of the sun), in Mycenaean clay tables
was rendered as qa–si–re–u, i.e.Quasi-Rex,quasi-king! That means
that basileus is a messenger sent by a superior king or a regent;
consequently, basilica is his residence. Similarly, from quasi-kyror quasi



398
tsar (substitute of the sovereign), appeared the Latin word Caesar, i.e.
governor appointed by the superior king, i.e. Emperorin Latin.
The greatest discovery made by E.Benveniste concerns the title of
superior regent (Latinized title: vanact, Greek anax, compare anasso– to
reign). This title is employed in a solemn address to God the sovereign
(Zeus) in Iliad by Homer: TheoHwana; the first word means «God», the
second — «principal and unique sovereign».
At the dissimilation of the initial form Hwan(ah) and the later phonetic
changes, were produced Spanish Juan, Hungarian Janos, the two-faced
god Janus, and Tartar Khan, and Chinese/Corean title of the superior
governor Van, and Jewish Kahane, Iona (Ian) and Iohanaan (John), and
Russian Ivan.
The word found on Mycenaean clay tables, meaning the title of highest
sovereign is Wa-na-ka.
It is appropriate to remind that the most ancient Mycenaean culture is
considered as extinct approximately in 1100 BC. In reality it is probably the
culture of the 9th century AD, it is by 1800 years nearer to our time. And the
title-surname Ioann appears in Russian history for the first time (!) in the 14th
century – Ivan Kalita, or Caliph, alias Presbyter Iohann, or the First-Baptist
Iohann, or John the Baptist. In his honour the calendar begins from January,
in Russia they sing Koliades (Calendae in Greek). That is why Homer probably
created «Ilyad» somewhat later – in the 15th century, after the defeat of
Tsar-Grad = Byzantium = Constantinople = Troy (city of the Trinity).
THE EMPIRE OF KNOWLEDGE
The time of the Golden Horde was a new stage of civilization. Appearance
of horse transport and cavalry made it necessary to build roads, that made
it possible to communicate much faster. It gave the start to mass town
planning and constructing, money circulation and spreading of written
language. There was the stage of populating and settling throughout the
world.
At that time the new system of towns was created: Gardarika = «Great
Novgorod» in the North –East Europe, Hanseatic League in the North
West , Castilia and Bourgogne in the South-West , Naples (Italian Napoli,
that means «New towns») in the South. In the 14th century Rome and
Moscow were founded probably at the same time (in 1360-1380).
We should clarify the medieval meaning of the Empire concept to recall
the real level of development of the European civilization . After the center
(Constantinople) declined in the 15th century several Empires of a new
type arose instead of the united one. They were: Ottoman, Spanish,
Portuguese, British and Austro-Hungarian (the 16th — 17th centuries)
Russian (the 18th century), French and German (the 19th century).
In German the idea of «Empire» is transferred with the word «Reich»
that means simply «a state». In Spanish, Portuguese and Russian the
word «Empire» (Sp., Port. imperio) comes from bookish Latin impero
(«command», cf. Italian Impero«Empire»).
In English and French the spelling and pronunciation are different:
Empire.



399
This small difference seems insignificant but it’s not. In Greek empiria
means «knowledge, experience», (the word «autocracy» carries the
meaning of an«Empire»), that’s why English and French designation of an
«Empire» retains the Byzantine meaning of this notion.
The Byzantine Empire technically could have been neither an unitary
state nor an absolute monarchy The existence of a united land state is
impossible without the necessary means of communication, transport,
and connection ,and mobile force structure.
In the 13th century the formation of cavalry (horse transport and cavalry
as a sort of army) was accomplished (compare Batu’s tumen = 10000
horsemen). The Byzantine Empire appeared as a consequence of the above
mentioned historical events. The formation of the cavalry made the efficient
leadership and regular tax collection possible in the regions of the Empire.
The relations between regions and the center (Tzar-Grad) were of various
types. There was a direct government from the center within the areas
nearby, there were feudal treaties with the local rulers (of vassal-suzerain
type) or even some «democratic» (formally equal) treaties with European
towns-republics like Venice and Novgorod took place.
Consequently, local conflicts existed within the area framework of the
Empire. However, the center didn’t take under consideration local conflicts
if they didn’t refer to basic economical interests of the Empire. For example,
the slack struggle for the continental property between English & French
relatives from the Anjou dynasty retained from growing into the «100-year
War» until the Angels dynasty was in power in the center of the Empire.
The name «England» is connected to this dynasty family, as well as the
name of French province Anjou with the capital city of Angers (cf. also
Angulême, the capital of Angoumois). Though new French spelling conceals
«Angelic» origin of these names , Portuguese, being more conservative
language, kept «Gallico-Galician» pronunciation of the word «angel»: anjo.
(Let us mention the fact that there are no trustworthy marks of the mythical
tribe of «Angles» in the continental Europe.
Numerous descriptions of various invasions of pagans, barbarians,
«busurmen», «Normans» and others show not only the internecine
struggle within the Empire. But also it shows that the central authorities
suppressed any kind of revolt especially if a town refused to pay taxes, in
other words, if it undermined the economic base of the Empire.
Let’s turn to Alexander Nevsky «who preserved Novgorodskaya Rus
from invasions both form the north and from the south in the 13th
century. It is known that Alexander Nevsky had «yarlykof Khan», it means
that every year (i.e. in German järlich, cf. yarlyck!) he got the renewed
right for the local authority from the center (nowdays we’d call him a
governor), Alexander beat «Swede» Earl Birger from time to time an he
still was shrewd and cunning enough to remain on friendly terms with a
«Tartarian» Khan Berke, Batu’s younger brother.
The known Birger’s and Berke’s biographical data coincide in details
(for example, life period 1209-1266). Moreover, according to M.Orbini’s
book on the history of «Slaviano-Russes» edited by Peter I in 1722, «Tartar
Swede» Berke-Birger and Slavonic Tzar Berikh were the same person.
The essence of the complicated relationship between the two Earls
Berikh and Alexander is clear: in 1257 Berke-Berikh headed population



400
census and inspection of the Russian lands on the instructions from the
center. This infringed the regional interests which A.Nevsky defended.
Berikh-Birger-Berke was obviously a tribute collector. Taking into
consideration the fact that in Romanian and Moldavian bir means «tribute»
(like in Ukrainian zbir, in Russian sbor); in Norwegian birk means «a judge,
appointed by the center»; in French bureaumeans «administration». The
ancient Swedish « capital was called Birka– a place of gathering.
In Tartarian bar means «it is» (here: «the tribute has been collected»,
and yok means «not» {here: «there is no tribute»). This Tartar yok
corresponds to «yoke».
Hence comes the «yoke»: an insolvent is to be enslaved — yoked.
(Code «Russian Truth» by Jaroslav the Wise.)
Simultaneously with Berke-Birger-Berikh, SyrianSultan with the Jewish
name Barukh collected the tribute throughout the Mediterranean lands.
Besides the Swedish «Birka» within the Empire there were places to keep
regional treasuries. Nearby gold-fusing plants were working: for example
in the time of Tzar Boris such plants were in Kasimov, Tzarev-Borisov
and Kosh-Yaitsk, and also in Prague, Milan,Toledo, etc. Cossac’s Kosh,
Italiancassa— all this «mobile treasuries» of the Empire reminded modern
banks with their encashment service. The Golden Horde kosh was dug
into one of the burial mounds in case of a long campaign or invasion of
enemies — this is the famous gold from the scythian burial mounds that
treasure hunters have been looking for since the time of Catherine the
Great. The notion of state treasury in Rus was brought in by Ivan Kalita in
the middle of the 14th century. He was the one who introduced into practice
a purchase of the foreign land at public expense as well.
In 1399 Lithuanian Prince Vitautas (a Catholic) who was Moscow Prince
Vasily I’s (an Orthodox) father-in-law, the suzerain of Khan Tokhtamysh (a
pagan) and the ruler of the Eastern Germany, Poland, Central and Southern
Russia including Azov, declared that he would collect the tribute in the Horde
and mint coins with his own image chiselled on.(Prince Vitautas’ and Vasily’s
seals were absolutely indentical, by the way). Khan Temir-Kutlug (a pagan)
tried to dispute Vitautas’ claims, however, during the meeting in Lithuania he
had to admit that Vitautas was the eldest in the family. Emir Edigey (a
Muslim) interfered the family discussion. He said that Vitautas was, no
doubt, older than Temir-Kutlug or Vasily but he was younger than Edigey.
Then the eldest and the most respectable member of the ruling dynasty
(Jagiello) supported Vitautas, but he was too old to make his terms...
The family discord grow into a war. Vitautas was defeated. As a result
he had to waive his claims to a personal unshared authority in the Golden
Horde so he didn’t become next «Hwanah» like Ivan the Great. Hence
even traditional history illustrates that a stife between Princes-Khans-Emirs
(«Catholics», «Orthodoxes» , «Muslims» or «pagans») was a family
business within the Horde dynasty.
Alexander Vitautas (1350-1480) is a notable personality. The nickname
«Vitautas» means «curving, doubling up» obviously appeared because of
his inborn chorea – nervous tic, so called «St.Vittus’ dance». It’s worth
mentioning that the battle between « Muslims» and «Orthodoxes» in
Kossovo Field fell on June15 «St. Vittus’ day» (SerbianVidavdan). In 1399



401
the conflict between Emperor Vaclav IV and Kurfürsts resulted in the
Emperor’s defeat – it is just an analogue of Vitautas’ struggle with the Khans.
And in 1399 the main cathedral of Prague was named after St.Vittus. They
say it was from Roman basilica of the 10th century (Latin Sanct Viti).
However, this Latin expression refers to the senior god of Baltic-Slavonic
pagans — Sventovit, that means «Saint wit» whose four-faced statue in
the tample of Arkon on Rugen island was destroyed by the Vikings in
1169. To take under consideration the fact of the artificial 260 year shift to
the past because of the fictious «Yoke», let us assume that the destruction
of Sventovit’s pagan temple happened in 1429-1430, that was connected
to Vitautas’s Death.
A.Toroptsev («Moscow, the way to the Empire, 1147-1709», M.
«Tverskaya, 13», 2000) writes: «the situation in the Eastern Europe (the
end of the 14th — the beginning of the 15th centuries) seems strange:
Tokhtamysh destroyed and ravaged Moscow, but his children found a
shelter there. Vitautas being related with Vasily I dreamt to conguer him.
In 1422 Moscow and Tver armed forces helped Vitautas to win the war
against the Teutons. Some Khans helped the Grand Prince, the others
acted quite contrary.» We should take his bewilderment into account, but
it would have faded away at once had he considered the events as the
discord within a common dynasty of the Golden Horde.
In 1426, after Vasily, his son-in-law, had died, Vitautas took his last
campaign against Moscow. Karamzin mentioned that «even the Bohemians,
the Valachs and the troops of Tartarian Khan Ahmed» took part in the
campaign. «The Bohemians» were the Czechs and the Germans, «the
Valachs» designed Romanians and «the Tartars» were Mehmed’s Turks.
The grand international campaign had no result. Therefore «a violent
storm broke out thanks to the Providence» and Moscow ruled by Vitautas’
daughter Sophia remained safe. Vitautas abandoned his plans and in 1430
he arranged a great feast which lasted for several months in his residence
Troky (Trakai): «all the rulers of the Eastern Europe were present including
the old Jagiello, metropolitans of the Orthodox church, the Pope’s legates,
Byzantine patricians, Tartar Khans, Prussian «magister from Denmark»
etc. (It is significant that soon after Vitautas’ death, in 1431-1435, a schism
took place both in the Catholic and Orthodox Churches.Vitautast’s pupil
a boy, named Hadji-Devlet showed up in the Crimea. He started the Muslim
dynasty of the Crimean Khans-Tzars-Cyrii, i.e. Girees.
What «Tartar Yoke» or «Vikings invasions» should we discuss? What
«Spanish Reconqista», for instance, against «Almoravides» should we talk
about, if we have already mentioned that in Arabic Al-Moravia denotes
Slavonic Moravia, not African Mauritania? (Besides, one of the oldest
districts in Lisbon is called Moscovia). If we ignore common robbers, all
the tribute disagreements seem nothing but «the fiscal police» activity of
the Byzantine Empire (= the Golden Horde). There is «neither Hellene, nor
Israelite», there is only a tax-payer from the taxman’s point of view. Tax
collectors have never been very popular, so a swear-word «busurman»
(derived from German besteuermann «tax-collector, tormentor») appeared
in Russian.The fact that foreigners were sent to observe the tax-collection
is quite explicable. It was a method (an unsuccessful one) to cope with the
corruption of the local authorities.

Nowadays there is hardly a man to have speculated upon the derivation
of titles of the nobles: duke , marquis, baron, etc. For instance, German
Graf(Count) used to mean «clerk» (comp. Greek grapho «write»). Italian
Conte, as well as French Comte meant «(ac)counter», cf. Italian contare
«to count», French compter. (It would be a mistake to compare this to
modern «computer», that was derived from artificially created in the 18th
century «compute»- the radical «put» never existed in Latin). In English
«Count» and «count» are the same in spelling and pronounciation. After
the Byzantine Empire collapsed descendants of former clerks and
accounters inherited the titles of «Counts» in the new European empires.
Hence there was little difference between Russian «dyak» and French
«duc» in the 15th century. As well as there is no difference between «Baron»
and the former tax-collector «Berke-Birger-Berikh-Barukh».
However all these officials were in charge not only of the tax collection
and but of knowledge collection, too. They were supposed to report to the
center about every single discovery or invention, about any wonder and
unusual natural phenomena they came across. Tzar-Grad (Constantinople)
was the capital, the main depository of knowledge, the biggest Library
(Babylon, from Greek biblos «book»). These officials disseminated
knowledge and experience.
The main idea of that Empire was to preserve the unity of the mankind,
not to enslave one people by another, or to suppress heterodoxes (cf.
modern UNO) for the development of the civilization, that required a common
language. According to Karamzin, in the 15th century the Slavic language
was such European language for communication. It is a well known fact
that in the Western Europe the Greek language practically wasn’t spoken
as well as Latin was not spoken in Byzante till the middle of the 15thcentury.
Even Vatican admits that «Slavonic ABC» was widely used in the 13th
15th centuries. The Coronation Gospel of French kings in Reims is written
with Slavic characters.
Manuscripts in Greek and Hebrew appeared in Europe only in the
beginning of the 15th century. At first they were book-keeping scrolls:
census of population and lands, property, calculation of expenses and
profits of the Empire. To make sure of it we can turn to old Testament book
of « Numbers». Hebrew was used as a code for figures of accountancy.
It was the beginning of the «shadow economics» and «double-entry book
keeping»: the open information, written in commom ABC was accessible
for many people, but the secret information was only for the chosen ones,
i.e. the Israelites. Ivan Kalita had David’s Star and not a cross on his seal
as a symbol of the fact that he possessed the complete information.
Traditional European history considers «Protorenaissance» and early
«Renaissance» that came after «the bleak centuries» of decay around
Europe (in the 7th — 12th centuries) to be the time of various barbarian
invasions, the golden age of Arabian culture, when Moors ruled in the South
West of Europe. Therefore similtaniously with «Protorenaissance» in 1212
1492 the Spanish and the Portuguese returned power over Iberian peninsula
(«Reconqista»). It it the same history of «Byzantine UNO» described by
the traditional history from different points of view.

The position of G. K. Kasparov is very strong, knowledge of antique and
medieval world describers — geographers is exaggerated by a historical
science a lot. A typical bluff at a card game, in poker, for example.
But geographical maps «game» can be favourable only for those who
are not going to travel using these maps.
Let’s look at a present day map of Africa. Practically all political borders
coincide with geological (and with geographical) borders (water-currents,
mountain ridges, canyons, breakages, bogs). The nature itself outlined areas

World Map according to Hecataeus
(from Thomson’s book)
World Map according to Herodotus (from Thomson’s book)
J. O. Thomson (History of ancient geography. Ì. Foreign Literature. 1953) enables us to
be convinced that Herodotus and Hecataeus maps differ unsignificantly. May be, they
are copies of an unknown original. Or, may be, Herodotus as «father of geography»
improved Hecataeus’ map under the right of the apostle.
Hecataeus of Miletus lived as it is said from 546 up to 480 BC. He is known as the author
of «Description of the World» (geography) — a book of regional geographic character,
and also as the author of «Genealogy» — collection of Greek myths and legends.
Herodotus lived from 490 to 425 BC. And as «the scientific descendant» was crowned
with laurels as the father of geography... Certainly, if encyclopaedias do not tell lies.

of tribes. Centuries will pass, and peoples will call these initial areas their
Motherland.
We shall find the same natural borders on other inhabited continents.
But, if we meet such borders on «ancient» maps then these maps are
false! They were made much later, then they was specified, when
cartographers had already known about mountains, valleys and rivers of
rather extensive spaces and had successfully attached them to present
day system of meridians and parallels!
So what should we believe in?
