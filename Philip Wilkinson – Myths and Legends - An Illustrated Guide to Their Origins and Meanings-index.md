INTRODUCTION
M
yths-stories of the gods. of heroes. and of grem cosmic events-are told in all of the world's many cultures They deal with the deepest, most fundam ental issues: the creation of the universe and of the human race. the nature of the gods and spirits, what happens to us when we die, and how the world will end . They examine love and jealousy, war and peace. good tmd eviL Myths explore these crucial issues with intriguing plots, vivid characters, memorable scenes, and conce pts 1har touch our deepes1 e m oli ons~ and so they have become eternally fascinating Myths began as tales told around the fire by successive generm.ions. and in places they are srill passed on orally. L"ller. with the inventio n of writing. people began to write their myths down and adapt them in new ways-mrning 1hem im o plays, poems. or novels. for example
Some of the world's greatest literature, from the Greek epics of Homer to the sagas of the early Icelandic writers. are based on much older myths that were origi nally told orall y.
MYRIAD MYTJ-lS Because of their oral roots, myths are not set in stone. Each one, endlessly retold, has spawned variations_Often, there is no single "correct" version of a myth. The name of a god will change from one tribe to the next: a twist in a rale will be explained in different ways by neighboring groups. Written versions of a myth multiply the retellings still further This book can only 1.ell a fraction of rhe world's myrhs. and usually only b>ives one version of each story. But it does contain a generous selection of myths from around the globe, including many from rhe cultures of

Europe thac because they have been written down and widely circulated, have had an enonnous influence across the world.
COSMOS AND PEOPLE
Among the seemingly endless variety of myths are common themes. Nearly every mythology starts with the question: "How did the universe begin7" Often. a shadowy c reat or takes the firsT step: a god. perhaps, who wills himself into bei ng. Frequentl y, the creator is faced \'lith a cosmic egg_ In one variation of the Chinese creation myth, for instance, the god Pan Gu has to break such an egg 10 fom1 the land and sky. Sometimes the creator has 10 fetch land from the depths of a primal ocean-like The
Earth Diver, a common figure in Native
American myths. In other myths the world is the offspling of a male and a female creator Often, people come much later. Usually they are molded from day or cmved from wood Like human sculptors, the gods often make several false starts. Myths from Mexico to Greece tell of three versions of people, onl y the last being right_ Sometimes the first people are male. and when they begin to die the gods make women so that the people can reproduce.
GODS AND THEIR POWERS

Japan a nd Aflica. every rock. stream, lake. and hill may have its own spilit. Many are local deities, worshipped mainly by the people who live nearby and share their sacred space Yel even in cultures that ha\'C thous...mds of deities rhere are ~core" groups of widely known gods with special powers. There are gods of the sun, the rain, the sea, the sky, the mountains. and rhe rivers_ Specific gods look after hunting, fam1ing, love. childbirth, war. and death. The myths involving these gods rend w relate closely tO their roles Man>' other myths involve rnonals with extraordinary superhuman powers. These heroes accomplish apparently impossible tasks. win battles single-handedly, and even visit the
Undenvorld. They may also be culture heroes, who teach people imponant ski ll s such as fire-making_ Their achievements are often so great that they become gods when they die.
MYTHS OFTJ-IE ELEMENTS
Among the most prominent gods are those of the elements, notably the sun and the rain. They detem1ined whether crops grew. so the sun and weather gods were often the most widely worshipped of all the gods. From the Inca sun god lmi to the Greek sky god Zeus, they were supremely powerful Some of the most familiar mythical themes concern the elements. Many cult ures have a myth in which the sun disappears, depriving



the world of food and wannth and explaining night and d1y. Other cultures, such as China and pans of Africa, have a myth in which there is too much sunlight which the gods reduce, or counter with night. Worldwide, wrathful gods send great fl oods, sometimes wiping out all but one human L·unil y before nonnality is restored Stories like these explain natuml disasters and encourage people to honour the gods. so that they wil l not unleash their anger: they are also glippi ng tales of adventure and rescue.
THE IMPORTANCE OF MYTHS
Myths reinforce the cultuml identity of the people who tell them. For the Abo rigines of Australia, the oli!,>in myths of each tlibe tell not onl y of the ancestors, but of the routes they took across the land when they brought each natural feature into being: the land, it.s people, and their myths are united inextricably. Myths were just. as important 10 the ancient Greeks. who named their gremest cit y. Athens. after its
patron goddess, Athena: to the lnc.1s, who believed their mlers to be descended from the sun god himsel f: and to the Norse, whose warliors tlied to emulate their great god Odi n. rhe vitality and importance of myths is seen not only in their countless retellings. but in the way their gods, heroes, and creatures have inspired artists. From China to ancient Rome, artists have painted and carved images of the gods. an activity that is sometimes itse lf an act of worship, someti mes more simply a celebration of the dei ties and their deeds Myths alise from an intimate relationship between people and the natuml and spi rit worlds-something so many of us have lost They opemte on the borders between reality and fantasy. celebrate oddity and uncertainty, and describe terrifying cosmic forces_ But they also deal \vith great excitement and inspirat ion Myths are the most enthralling stories we have, because they w uch our hearts and minds and reach to the very core of ou r being

ANCIENT GREEK CREATION
Classical mythology contains several accounts of the creation, telling how creator dei ties gave the universe shape and form before the first races to inhabit the cosmos were born. These creation stories give the background to the birth of the gods and goddesses who dominate much of Classical mythology and who were beli eved to dwell on Mount Olympus.

j.:f· COSMIC WAR
The gods of Mount Olympus, who are the the Titanomachia, involves many themesdominant characters in most of the myths of such as oracles, lost children, and revengeancient Greece, took control of the universe that arc prominent in later myths. At the end by fighting a long war with their ancestors of the struggle, Zeus emerged as the supreme and rivals, the Titans. The story of this ruler of the entire cosmos, and the defeated Cosmic War, wh ich is also known as Titans were banished to the Underworld.

ZEUS
Zeus, son of the Titans Cronus and Rhea, was the god of the sky and thunder. His most feared weapon was his thunderbolt, fashioned by the Cyclopes. He became ruler of the gods when he led them in their defeat of the Titans dming the Cosmic War (see pp.lB-19). Though he married the goddess Hera, he was famous for his many other sexual conquests, which included goddesses, nymphs, and mortal women. Some of the numerous children of these liaisons wielded immense power over the people of Earth. - - - - - - - - -ol!l.- -·

THE CREATION OF HUMANKIND
Unlike many cultures, ancient Greece did not have a single StOiy nan ating the origins of humanity. Greek myths men tion several a11empts at creating humans, or mortals as they were knovm. Three of these attempts failed before the current race of humans finally emerged , although it is not clear who is responsible for their creation. However, the origins of key cultural skills, such as fire-making, are firmly amibuted to the Titan Prometheus, who is port.rayed as a friend of humanity.

Portrayed as a handsome young man, the god Apollo had power over many aspects of life. Patron of archers, his bow brought pain to humans, but he was also a god of healing and father to the mythical physician Asclepius. He was the god of music and the arts, and an accomplished player of the lyre. The son of Zeus and Leto, Apollo was also worshipped as the god of light and the sun.

POSEIDON AND
THE FLOOD
Many ancient Greeks lived on islands or in settlements dose to the coast, so their lives were dominated by the sea . Consequently; the sea god Poseidon , a bringer of violent storms, who also controlled natural forces such as earthquakes, was one of the most powerful gods of Mount Olympus. But he longed for more power, and became involved in a dispute with Athena for the great honor of being the patron deity of the city of Athens. ---· · - - - - - - - - - - -,l!r, -·- -·

h~"'· DIONYSUS
The god of wine, Dionysus, was an anarchic figure who presided over dmnkenness and other irrational or ahered states, such as religious ecstasy. A shape-changer, he could take the form of an animal but also appeared as a human, when he was often accompanied by revellers or anima ls. These quali ties made him a patron of actors, and plays were regularly performed at the Athenian festivals held in his name.

ATHENA
A powerful war goddess, Athena was usually depicted with her shield or protective cloak, known as the aegis. She was also a patron of crafts, especially pottery, weaving, and shipbuilding, and the goddess of the city of Athens. She inherited the wisdom of her mother, Metis, an attribute that made her favor Odysseus, the wisest and most cunning of the Greek heroes. In all these roles she was especially valued because she was always accessible, unlike many gods who kept their distance from humans.

ORPHEUS IN THE UNDERWORLD
The hero Orpheus was famed for two major qualities. The first was his remarkable musicianship, which, according to some, he had learned from Apollo. With his music, he was able to charm gods and mortals alike. Orpheus was also very brave, and had accompanied jason on his quest for the Golden Fleece (see pp.72-73). But his most daring adventure was his legendary journey to the Underworld.

of King Creon of Thebes, but Hera made him go mad and kill his wife and children. To punish Heracles, King Emystheus of Mycenae set him l2 apparently impossible tasks to accomplish.

BELLEROPHON AND PEGASUS
Like most Greek heroes, Bcllerophon was given a seemingly impossible task-killing a monster called the Chimaera. With divine assistance and the aid of the fabulous flying horse, Pegasus, Bcllerophon succeeded, but his triumph gave him an inflated view of his
own status. He overreached himself when he used the horse's flying ability to try to visit the gods at Mount Olympus. The gods saw this act as supremely presumptuous. Although Bcllerophon was a hero , he did not have the rank of a god, and so was punished. ---· - - - - - - - - - - - - - o!f, - - - · - · · - - - - - - - - - - -

THE EXPLOITS OF PERSEUS
Perseus----one of the greatest Greek heroeswas the son of Zeus and Danae, the daughtet of Acrisius, the King of Argos. An oracle had once predicted that Acrisius would be killed by his daughter's son. To prevent the oracle's warning from coming true, he imprisoned his daughter and grandson , Perseus, in a
wooden chest and threw it into the sea. The chest reached the island of Scriphos, where Perseus and his mother were rescued by the king, Polydectes, who brought him up. Many years later, Polydectes would be the one to send Perseus on his most perilous journeyto retrieve the head of the Gorgon Medusa --·----·-----------· -

OEDIPUS
Laius and Jocasta , the King and Queen of the city of Thebes, were told by the oracle at Delphi that their son would kill his fath er and marry his mother. Terrified by the prophecy, when their son, Oedipus, was born, they abandoned
the child on a mountain and left him to die. So began one of the most tragic tales in all Classical mythology. By the end of the story, the entire family was destroyed, victims of fat e and the impossibility of avoiding it. Oedipus became the archetypal tragic hero , trying to live well but thwarted by destiny.

CLA SSICAL ANTIHEROINES
Greek myliwlogy has many antiheroines who were embroiled in complex plots, mostly involving revenge. A number of them, such as !no and Clytemnestra , chose to do so out of jealousy, or because they lacked the moral and social virtues considered necessary in noble
women. But the actions of others were guided more by the interference of gods in human affairs. These antiheroines were often responsible , directly or indirectly; for the deaths of Olhers , and their stories frequent ly ended with their own deaths, often by su icide.

THE NORSE COSMOS
The ancient Norse myths imagined the cosmos as a series of separate regions or worlds, each the home of a different race of beings, from giants to dwarfs. These various worlds were supported by the roots and branches of a vast ash tree called Yggdrasil, also known as the world tree. Though the precise details of these worlds differed from one account
to another, Yggdrasil remained a constant feature.

MYTHS OF THE ·ANCIENT CELTS
The territory of the ancient Ccilic people stretched from Britain, across France and Germany, to Cent ral Europe. Although they were not literate to begin with, these people had a highly developed culture, and excavations of their graves and religious
si tes show that they worshipped many diffcre111 gods and goddesses. The Romans , who eventually conquered most of their lands, left descriptions of some of the Celtic deities and religious rituals, and identified many of those deities with their own.

MYTHS OF WOOD AND WATER
The Slavic lands are full of dense forests and misty lakes , both natural and man-made. From earliest times these places were believed to have their special spirits. Some were threatening beings that embodied the anxiety of travelers, who were fearful of getting lost in the woods or drowning while crossing a lake. Even country people, who knew the forests and lakes of their region well , were wary of these spirits.

THE EPIC OF GILGAMESH
The story of Gilgamesh, the King of Uruk, is the oldest extended narrative to have come down from the ancient world. It survives in the form of an epic poem written on clay tablets in the 7th century t>CE in Assyria, although the story dates back to the 3rd millennium BCE. Its themes of heroism, frien dship, and the quest for immortality, together with the poem's exotic cast of characters, have proved fascinating for generations of readers.

THE LEGEND OF RUSTUM AND SOHRAB
RusiUm was th e greatest hero of the early Persians: a brave wan ior who defended himself and his people against the most fearsome and powerful foes. Rustum's bravery and skill, not to mention his mastery of the noble stallion Rakhsh, make him an exemplary character, but
his life was marred by tragedy when he unwittingly killed his own son, Sohrab. The story of th is event is a key episode in the Persian epic Shalmama (Book of Kings), and is also the subject of a famou s poem by the British poet Matthew Arnold (1822--88) .

THE GODDESS AL-LAT
The cultures of the Arabian Pen insula worshipped a number of deities before the coming of Islam in the 7th cemury: One of the most important was the goddess Al-Lat, now a shadowy figure, b ut whose image was once widely seen in West and Cen tral Asia. Her cult was based near Mecca, the place where the Islamic faith was later revealed to the Prophet Muhammad.

THE VEDIC GODS
Some of India's earliest myths are derived from the Aryans, people of Central Asian origin who migrated to the region during the 2nd millennium BCE. Their myths were recorded in sacred texts known as the Vedas, which emphasized belief in gods that controlled the
natural world and could influence human well-being. Chief among the Vedic deities were figures such as Indra , Agni , and Surya. These early deities were often known as the Adityas, or sons of Aditi, the goddess of space and mother of all creatu res and deities.

BRAHMAAND THE CREATION
Over their long history, the Vedic religion and Hinduism have produced a number of creation stories. Some involve a primal creator- Prajapati (Lord of Creatures) or the god Brahmawhile other myths explain the creation of th e various life forms, including humanity. They are told in the conte.'.:t of a cyclical notion of time, in which the universe will one day come to an end and a new era of creation will begin.

DURGA
The Hindu goddess known as Durga {the Unattainable) usually takes the form of a warrior. She can embody all the martial energy in the cosmos and concentrate it to become an invincible foe of liwse who threaten her fellow deities. She is renowned as an opponent of demons who th reaten the cosmic order. Like her consort Shiva, (see pp.194- 95), Durga has a complex personality. Although essentially created to be a destroyer, in some forms she can also be a nurturing dei ty.

THE RAMAYANA
The Ramayana is one of the two great Indian epics \VIitten in the ancient Sanskrit language , and a seminal text in Hindu mythology. It tells the story of Rama, the Prince of Ayodhya and an incarnation of Vishnu (see pp.196-97) , from his upbtinging, through his e.:...i!e, to the rescue of his wife , Sita, from the demon king Ravana's clutches. Through its depiction of the main characters, the epic e'{tols the virtues of loyalty, kinship, devotion, and duty.

THE MAHABHARATA
One of the longest poems in the world , the Mahabharata is the second of the two great ancient Indian epics. Traditionally attributed to the scribe Vyasa , who also compiled the Ved as (sec p.188) , the poem was probab ly
composed by several writers between the Slit century BCE and the 4th century CE. The epic centers on a war between two rival families , but it also contains the Bhagavad Gita, a sacred te:xt outlining the key tenets of Hinduism .

THE ORIGIN OF THE GANGES
The Ganges (Ganga) is sacred in Hinduism both as a river and as the goddess Ganga, who personifies its waters. According to a popular myth, the Ganges originally flowed in heaven, before being allowed by the gods to descend to Earth and flow through the region that became India. Devout Hindus believe that the river has the property of washing away all sins.

PAN GU CREATES THE UNIVERSE
The Chinese creation myths describe how the primal god Pan Gu beat chaos into order to make the world. After this, a gentler, more nurturing creator deity appeared, the goddess NO Wa, who formed the first people out of clay. The origin of the many other gods and goddesses is told elsewhere in Chinese myth.

,,~ THE ADVENTURES
OF MONKEY
O ne of the best-loved of all Chinese myths is the story of a mischievous character named Mon key. It tells how Monkey runs amok , upsetting all the gods, and causes still more mischief when he is punished. Finally, he is made to join a Buddhist pilgrim on an expedition and reforms himself. Involving Daoist, Buddhist, and ancient Chinese deities, the s10ry appeals to all with its lively plot and likeable, albeit roguish , central figure.

His son , Okuninushi-the god of abundance, medicine, sorcery, and happy maniagcs-bccame a powerful ruler and the most important Shinto deity after Amaterasu. --- ·------------- 0 ----

A KING'S MURDER
A popular myth from ancient Egypt narrates the swry of a tragic rivahy for the throne of Egypt between two divine brothers, the virtu ous Osiris and the wicked Set, and the subsequent dispute between Set and Horus, the son of Osiris. The myth was well known because it dealt with the rule of Egypt, and also because the story of the death and revival of Osiris gave people hope of an afterlife. ·------~- ;;;; --

GODDESSES OF THE NILE
Egypt's crowded pantheon included several goddesses who performed a variety of divine functions, ranging from Neith, the creator deity, to the many goddesses who presided over ferti lity, love, and ch ildbirth. Although most of them were worshipped in temples by their
own dedicated s taff of priests, these goddesses -who were all , in a way, aspects of a single great goddess figure-we re also held in great respect and affection by the common people. Pilgtims made offerings 10 them, praying for prosperity, protection, and healthy offspring.

AFRICAN ORIGINS
The peoples of Africa have different stories that explain the creation of the Earth, the origin of the sun, moon , and stars, and the ancestry of each tribe. Sometimes humans emerge from a hole in the ground, sometimes they are molded by a creator deity. Most of these swries revolve around the activities of one supreme being, although in the creation myth of Dahomey, this deity is helped by a cosmic serpent in the task of creation .

ANANSE
The spider Ananse is a trickster and also a cuhure hero in West Africa, especially among the Ashanti people of Ghana. Besides his tricks, Anan se is well known for using his intellect to owwit creatures much stronger than himself- s tories about these pranks are commonly told both for amusement and to highlight the fact that brains are as important
as muscles. In some myths , the trickster acts as an intermediary between human beings and the sky god Nyame. Some even believe that it was Ananse who persuaded Nyame to create the sun and moon so that people on Earth could benefit from having night and day.

THE FIRST CATTLE
The Masai, a cattle-herding people who live in Kenya, have several myths about how they came to own cattle. Other herding tribes in Africa have similar stories, which are testimony to the important role of cattle in
a man from one of the humer-gatherer tribes of Kenya and Tanzania , who are widely referred to by the herding people as the Dorobo (the ones without cattle).

POPOLVUH
The creation story and other myths of the Quiche Maya, a native people belonging w the highlands of Guatemala, are told in a book called the Popol Vuh (Council Book). This text was written down in the mid-16th century, after the Spanish conquest o f the area, and was copied from an earlier version in Maya glyphic \vri ting It records myths dating back many centuries; one important section of the narrative concerns the adventures of a pair of Hero Twins, who travel to the Mayan Underworld , Xibalba.

AZTEC NATURE GODS
Many Aztec gods controlled the natural force s on which the people depended for their survival. Some of these deities were dreaded beings , ru thless in their dealings with the Earth and its inhabitants; their actions reflected the harsh climate and
conditions of Aztec lands, in the region now known as Mexico . Their stories are frequentl y associa ted with the custom of human sacrifice-one deity, for example, demanded an offering of human blood before allowing the crops to ripen.

INCA BEGINNINGS
In the centuries preceding the Spanish conquest of Peru in the 16th century, the Incas built a vast empire in the Andes mountains o f western South America. They had a sophisticated oral culture, and their mythology tells many d ifferent tales of their origin , all of which feature an ancestor called Manco Capac who , together with a number of followers, emerges into the world from a cave.

THE PRIMAL SISTERS
A widespread Aboriginal myth from Australia male and female entities, which culminates in describes a pair of ancestral sisters, often the snake swallowing the women. The sisters kn own as the Wawilak or Wagilag Sisters, survive, however, and finally escape the snake's who travel across Arnhem Land . They have stomach to coexist w ith their a rch rival , a traumatic encoun ter with the Rainbow Snake reinforcing the idea that both male and female (see pp.32S--29) , seen as a conflict between the forces are needed for creation to be balanced.

TANGAROA
One of the mos t promine nt deities of the Pacific isla nds is Ta ngaroa (also known as Ta'aroa or Tagaroa). He is considered to be a sea god in some places, bur in Tahiti and among the other island communities, including Samoa , Tonga, and Tuvalu, Tangaroa is known as th e crea10r of the cosmos and all its inhabitams. Some people believe that he was the son of the primal deities Rangi and Papa, bu t another version of the myth says that he created the universe after tearing a part the two halves of a great s hell w hen emerging from it.

THE ORIGIN OF DEATH
The Mami story of the origin of death involves their fo rest god Tane. He is one of the sons of the primal deities Rangi and Papa (sec p.339), who had only male children. Tane brings death into the world by breaking a taboo, when , after making a wife for himself out
of sand and clay, he goes on to marry his own daughter, the beautiful Hine-titama (Dawn Maiden) . It is a sad s10ry, because in many ways Tane, a god who plants the fi rst trees, is a fri end of humanity, and yet it is he who becomes the bringer of death.
