The contrary meanings of arrows
depicted on Indus seals
Number 1
This is an imprint of a unique cylinder seal made in Afghanistan between 23rd-21st c. BC. Although the image is Akkadian the inscription is Harappan, and thus we must interpreted the meaning of this seal on the basis of Rigveda hymns rather than on Sumerian literature.
The image shows a hunter shooting a boar and according to Rigveda 1-121-11 this boar is Vritra:
Rigveda 1-121 called: ‘Indra’.
11 ‘The mighty Heaven and Earth, those bright expanses that have no wheels, joyed, Indra, at thine exploit. Vritra, the boar who lay amid the waters, to sleep thou sentest with thy mighty thunder. 12 Mount Indra, lover of the men thou guardest, the well-yoked horses of the wind, best bearers. The bolt which Kavya Usana erst gave thee, strong, gladdening, Vritra-slaying, hath he fashioned’.
According to Rigveda 10-86-3/4 Indra is supreme over all and the hound may seize the boar:
Rigveda 10-86 called: ‘Indra’.
2 ‘Thou, Indra, heedless passest by the ill Vrsakapi hath wrought; Yet nowhere else thou findest place wherein to drink the Soma juice. Supreme is Indra over all. 3 What hath he done to injure thee, this tawny beast Vrsakapi, With whom thou art so angry now? What is the votary's foodful store? Supreme is Indra over all. 4 Soon may the hound who hunts the boar seize him and bite him in the car,
O Indra, that Vrsakapi whom thou protectest as a friend, Supreme is Indra over all.’
The single arrow in the middle may indicate the whole Accadian scene, it may symbolize that Indra, a storm god, shoots Vritra, the god of drought.

On these seals the arrows on the left symbolize that Indra defeats Vritra and the fish indicates that he liberates the rivers at the same time. This fish embodies river goddesses like Valli and Saraswathi just like a bull or an elephant embodies the storm god Indra.
In many Rigveda hymns, Indra battles Vritra and liberates the rivers, but each battle and each liberation is described in a different way: in Rigveda 10-89-5 Indra drinks soma which is armed as with arrows, and as an axe fells the tree so he slew Vritra, brake down the strongholds and dug out the rivers’:
Rigveda 10-89 called: ‘Indra’.
5 ‘Rousing with draughts, the Shaker, rushing onward, impetuous, very strong, armed as with arrows is Soma; forest trees and all the bushes deceive not Indra with their offered likeness. 6 Soma hath flowed to him whom naught can equal, the earth, the heavens, the firmament, the mountains, When heightened in his ire his indignation shatters the firm and breaks the strong in pieces.
7 As an axe fells the tree so he slew Vritra, brake down the strongholds and dug out the rivers’.



M-37 a
Again, the arrow on the left symbolizes that Indra defeats Vritra and the fish symbolizes that he frees the rivers: The third sign, a so called ‘rake’, is similar to an Sumerian archaic sign:
Archaic Sumerian Pictographic Signs by Ashur Cherry
It means ‘gal’, which can be translated as: ‘big’:
‘gal [BIG] (6612x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Ebla, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. gal; gu-la; gu-ul; gal-gal; ku-ul ‘(to be) big, great; (to be) retired, former; (to be) mature (of male animals)’ Akk. rabû ‘big; noble, chief of...’.

However, in Indus script this sign may symbolize that the rivers grow and that they get big: in March the water in the rivers start to rise because of the melting of the snow in the mountains. But in July they get really big as they flood their banks because of the rainy season:
‘The principal rivers of the Indus River system are snow-fed. Their flow varies greatly at different times of the year: the discharge is at a minimum during the winter months (December to February), there is a rise of water in spring and early summer (March to June), and floods occur in the rainy season (July to September).’

Number 2
It is obvious that an arrow symbolizes ‘death’: here the storm god, shaped like a bull, defeats five demons. These demons may be ‘Vrcivan's sons, falling before the arrow’, or Dasyus and Simyus: ‘He laid them low with arrows’:
Rigveda 6-27 called: ‘Indra’.
6 Three thousand, mailed, in quest of fame, together, on the Yavyavati, O much-sought Indra, Vrcivan's sons, falling before the arrow, like bursting vessels went to their destruction’.
Rigveda 1-100 called: ‘Indra’. 18 He, much invoked, hath slain Dasyus and Simyus, after his wont, and laid them low with arrows.
The mighty Thunderer with his fair-complexioned friends won the land, the sunlight, and the waters.
Nevertheless, an arrow also symbolizes ‘life’ or ‘creation’ as it more or less looks like a phallus:
Altaic Hieroglyphs and Hittite Inscriptions by C. R. Conder, Capt. R.E.
In Sumer the word Ti means ‘arrow’, ‘rib’ and it also means ‘life’. ‘Nin-ti is the Sumerian ‘she who makes life’.
It means that an arrow has two contrary meanings: it kills and creates life at the same time: in a verse from Rig Veda 10-165-3 a prayer ask if the Arrow may bring welfare and cattle:
Rigveda 10-165 called: ‘Visvedevas.’.
3 ‘Let not the Arrow that hath wings distract us: beside the fire-place, on the hearth it settles. May, it bring welfare to our men and cattle: here let the Dove, ye Gods, forbear to harm us’.
And the first sentences of Rigveda 10-42 reads like a love song:
Rigveda 10-42 called: ‘Indra’. 1. ‘Even as an archer shoots afar his arrow, offer the laud to him with meet adornment. Quell with your voice the wicked's voice, O sages. Singer, make Indra rest beside the Soma. 2 Draw thy Friend to thee like a cow at milking: O Singer, wake up Indra as a lover. Make thou the Hero haste to give us riches even as a vessel filled brimful with treasure’.



M-1030 M-395 M-759 of M-686
So, on these seals the three arrows look like phalluses and symbolize that children are created. The wombs on the right symbolize that these children are born about nine months later:

‘Six symbolic abstract representations of external female genitals which have been used in various historical/cultural contexts’.
http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vulva_symbols.svg
On the second seal is a so called ‘crab’ sign. It symbolizes a ‘womb with two spreading legs’, which emphasizes childbirth: all by itself a womb symbolizes femininity in general.
Now we can relate the signs to sentences from Rigveda 7-85 called: ‘Indra-Varuna’:
o In the first place the arrow indicates the fight of Indra: ‘Here where the arrows fall amid the banners’. o But it also indicates his fertility, so in the hymn a prayer asks him: ‘win me sons and offspring’. o The fish indicate water and in the hymn we read: ‘heavenly Waters endowed with Godhead Varuna and Indra’. o And the two ‘rakes’ symbolize the grows of the rivers during the monsoon rains. o At last, the wombs indicate that children Indra engendered are given birth:
Rigveda 7-85 called: ‘Indra-Varuna’.
1. ‘For you I deck a harmless hymn, presenting the Soma juice to Varuna and IndraA hymn that shines like heavenly Dawn with fatness. May they be near us on the march and guard us.
2 Here where the arrows fall amid the banners both hosts invoke the Gods in emulation. O Indra-Varuna, smite back those-our foemen,yea, smite them withyour shaft to every quarter.
3 Self-lucid in their seats, e'en heavenly Waters endowed with Godhead Varuna and Indra. One of these holds the folk distinct and sundered, the Other smites and slays resistless foemen. 4 Wise be the priest and skilled in Law Eternal, who with his sacred gifts and oration. Brings you to aid us with your might, Adityas: let him have viands to promote his welfare. 5 May this my song reach Varuna and Indra, and, strongly urging, win me sons and offspring.
To the Gods' banquet may we go with riches. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods with blessings’.



Banawali 3 M-1912 b
Again, on these seals the arrows indicate that Indra beats Vritra. The two fish indicate that at the same time the rivers are liberated. And the three and four vertical dashes symbolize ‘grain’ or ‘barley’. They also symbolize ‘food’ in general and even ‘wealth’. According to the Rigveda Indra is giver of barley:
Rigveda 1-53 called ‘Indra’.
2 ‘Giver of horses, Indra, giver, thou, of kine, giver of barley, thou art Lord and guard of wealth:
Now we can relate these signs to sentences from Rigveda 10-99:
o The arrow may indicate what is written in verse 7: he ‘shot his arrow against the guileful and oppressive foeman’. o The fish indicates water and verse 1 reads: (Indra) ‘sent us waters’ and verse 8 reads: ‘He, like a cloud that rains upon the pasture’. o And the dashes symbolize food and in verse 12 we read that (Indra)‘hat brought all, food, etc.’.
Rigveda 10-99 called: ‘Indra’.
I. What Splendid One, Loud-voiced, Farstriding, dost thou, well knowing, urge us to exalt with praises? What give we him? When his might dawned, he fashioned the Vritra-slaying bolt, and sent us waters.
2 He goes to end his work with lightning flashes: wide is the seat his Asura glory gives him. With his Companions, not without his Brother, he quells Saptatha's magic devices. (-)
7 He raised himself on high and shot his arrow against the guileful and oppressive foeman. Strong, glorious, manliest, for us he shattered the forts of Nabus when he slew the Dasyus. 8 He, like a cloud that rains upon the pasture, hath found for us the way to dwell in safety. When the Hawk comes in body to the Soma, armed with his iron claws he slays the Dasyus. 9 He with his potent Friends gave up the mighty, gave gusnia up to Kutsa for affliction. He led the lauded Kavi, he delivered Atka as prey to him and to his heroes. (-) 11 Through lauds of him hath Ausija Rjisvan burst, with the Mighty's aid, the stall of Pipru. When the saint pressed the juice and shone as singer, he seized the forts and with his craft subdued them. 12 So, swiftly Asura, for exaltation, hath the great Vamraka come nigh to Indra. He will, when supplicated, bring him blessing: he hath brought all, food, strength, a happy dwelling.



M-1148 M-1161
The elephants on these seals represent Indra. Nowadays an elephant is the mount of the storm god but in the Indus Valley Civilization it embodies the storm god himself.
We can more or less relate the signs of these two seals to sentences from Rigveda 1-54:
o Both the arrow and the fish indicate the fight of Indra and the liberation of the waters: ‘There darkness stood, the vault that stayed the waters' flow: in Vritra's hollow side the rain-cloud lay concealed. But Indra smote the rivers which the obstructer stayed, flood following after flood, down steep declivities’. o The arrow also indicate his fertility, so in the hymn the prayer asks him: ‘vouchsafe us (-) food with noble offspring’. o The single long line on the second seal symbolizes a soma stalk: ‘be some who drink the Soma’. o The two dashes symbolize grain and indicate food: ‘vouchsafe us (-) food (-)’. o At last, the womb on the right symbolizes childbirth: the child Indra created is given birth about nine months later’.
Rigveda 1-54 called ‘Indra’.
8 ‘His power is matchless, matchless is his wisdom; chief, through their work, be some who drink the Soma, Those, Indra, who increase the lordly power, the firm heroic strength of thee the Giver. 9 Therefore for thee are these abundant beakers Indra's drink, stone-pressed juices held in ladles. Quaff them and satisfy therewith thy longing; then fix thy mind upon bestowing treasure.
10 There darkness stood, the vault that stayed the waters' flow: in Vritra's hollow side the rain-cloud lay concealed. But Indra smote the rivers which the obstructer stayed, flood following after flood, down steep declivities.
11 So give us, Indra, bliss-increasing glory give us great sway and strength that conquers people. Preserve our wealthy patrons, save our princes; vouchsafe us wealth and food with noble offspring’.



M-1109 M-259 H-85
Nowadays a zebu is called Nandi, the white bull on which Lord Shiva (the storm god Rudra) rides, but in the Indus Valley Civilization it represents the storm gods like Indra.
Now we can relate the signs to sentences from Rigveda 7-85:
o The three arrows symbolize Indra’s fight and in the hymn it may indicate the sentence: ‘Aloft he stood above the airy region, and against Vritra shot his deadly missile’. o They also indicate his fertility: in the hymn the prayer asks him:‘That we may gain (-) troops of children’. o The three fish may indicate: ‘The streams unceasing flow to Indra’. o And here the dashes on top may indicate the sentence: ‘That we may gain wealth’. o At last, the three wombs symbolize childbirth: the children Indra created are given birth.
Rigveda 2-30 called ‘Indra and Others’.
1. ‘The streams unceasing flow to Indra, slayer of Ahi, Savitar, God, Law's fulfiller, Day after day goes on the sheen of waters. What time hath past since they were first set flowing? 2 His Mother-for she knew-spake and proclaimed him who was about to cast his bolt at Vritra. Cutting their paths according to his pleasure day after day flow to their goal the rivers.
3 Aloft he stood above the airy region, and against Vritra shot his deadly missile.
Enveloped in a cloud he rushed upon him. Indra subdued the foe with sharpened weapons. (-) 10 Perform, O Hero, with our valiant heroes the deeds heroic which thou hast to finish. Long have they been inflated with presumption: slay them, and bring us hither their possessions. 11 I craving joy address with hymn and homage your heavenly host, the company of Maruts, That we may gain wealth with full store of heroes, each day more famous, and with troops of children’.



M-1206AE
On this seal the bull and the signs can be related to sentences from Rigveda 2-16 and 1-51:
o Below Indra is depicted like a bull drinking soma:
Rigveda 2-16 called ‘Indra’.
6 ‘Strong is thy thunderbolt, yea, and thy car is strong; strong are thy Bay Steeds and thy weapons powerful.
Thou, Indra, Bull, art Lord of the strong gladdening drink. with the strong Soma, Indra, satisfy thyself’.
o In the inscription the arrow indicates that the storm god defeats Vritra: ‘When thou hadst slain with might the dragon Vritra’. o The fish indicates the liberation of the waters: ‘Thou hast unclosed the prisons of the waters’. o And the four lines symbolize grass: ‘Discern thou well Aryas and Dasyus; punishing the lawless give them up to him whose grass is strewn’.
Rigveda 1-51 called ‘Indra’.
‘On Vimada thou hast bestowed both food and wealth, making thy bolt dance in the sacrificer's fight.
4 Thou hast unclosed the prisons of the waters; thou hast in the mountain seized the treasure rich in gifts. When thou hadst slain with might the dragon Vritra, thou, Indra, didst raise the Sun in heaven for all to see. 5 With wondrous might thou blewest enchanter fiends away, with powers celestial those who called on thee in jest. Thou, hero-hearted, hast broken down Pipru's forts, and helped Rjisvan when the Dasyus were struck dead. 6 Thou savedst Kutsa when Susna was smitten down; to Atithigva gavest Sambara for a prey. E'en mighty Arbuda thou troddest under foot: thou from of old wast born to strike the Dasyus dead. 7 All power and might is closely gathered up in thee; thy bounteous spirit joys in drinking Soma juice. Known is the thunderbolt that lies within thine arms: rend off therewith all manly prowess of our foe.
8 Discern thou well Aryas and Dasyus; punishing the lawless give them up to him whose grass is strewn. Be thou the sacrificer's strong encourager all these thy deeds are my delight at festivals’.



M-75
The inscription on this seal can be related to sentences from Rigveda 7-24:
o On the left the arrow indicates that the storm god defeats Vritra: ‘When his wrath thundered, when he rent Vritra to pieces, limb by limb’. o The arrow also indicate his fertility and indicate the sentence: ‘Give progeny’. o The fish indicates that he liberates the waters: ‘He sent the waters to the sea’. o The four lines symbolize trimmed grass: ‘Best slayer of Vritras, men whose sacred grass is ready trimmed’. o The two deashes symbolize grain and indicate the sentence: ‘Indra, disclose much food for us’. o The womb symbolizes that the child Indra engendered is given birth about nine months later.
Rigveda 8-6 called: ‘Indra’. 13 ‘When his wrath thundered, when he rent Vritra to pieces, limb by limb, He sent the waters to the sea.
14 Against the Dasyu gusna thou, Indra, didst hurl thy during bolt: Thou, Dread one, hast a hero's fame. (-) 22 Under thy guidance, Indra, mid thy praises, Lord of Thunder, shall The sacrifice be soon performed.
23 Indra, disclose much food for us, like a stronghold with store of kine: Give progeny and heroic strength.
24 And, Indra, grant us all that wealth of fleet steeds which shone bright of old Among the tribes of Nahusas. (-) 36 Come with thy lovely Bay Steeds, come to us from regions far away O Indra, drink this Soma juice.
37 Best slayer of Vritras, men whose sacred grass is ready trimmed Invoke thee for the gain of spoil’.



M-180
On this seal the sign in te middle are two doors, one of which is open and the other one is closed with a bar. This sign is depicted on quite a number of seals. In the first place it symbolizes that a door is opened, but it also symbolizes the term ‘to open’ in general. Like in Rigveda 10-38 it may indicate that Indra is asked to disclose opulence rich in food:
Rigveda 10-38 called: ‘Indra’.
1. ‘O Indra, in this battle great and glorious, in this loud din of war help us to victory, Where in the strife for kine among bold ring-decked men arrows fly all around and heroes are subdued. 2 At home disclose to us opulence rich in food, streaming with milk, O Indra, meet to be renowned. Sakra, may we be thine, the friendly Conqueror's: even as we desire, O Vasu, so do thou. 3 The godless man, much-lauded Indra, whether he be Dasa or be Arya, who would war with us, Easy to conquer he for thee, with us, these foes: with thee may we subdue them in the clash of fight’.



M-1709 a
Now we can relate the inscription on this seal to sentences from Rigveda 7-24:
o The sign on the left symbolizes an unbarred door and indicates: ‘When thou didst open wealth heaped up by many’. o The arrow indicates that the storm god defeats Vritra: ‘For hath not Indra sunk his bolt deep down in Vritra's vital part?’. o The fish indicates that he liberates the waters: ‘let us free the rivers let them flow loosed at the command of Indra’. o The two deashes symbolize corn and food and may indicate the sentence: ‘May she, the Gladdener, yielding food and vigour’.
Rigveda 8-89 called: ‘Indra. Vak’. When thou didst open wealth heaped up by many, brought from far away to Sarablia, the Rsi's kin. 7 Now run ye forth your several ways: he is not here who kept you back. For hath not Indra sunk his bolt deep down in Vritra's vital part?
8 On-rushing with the speed of thought within the iron fort he pressed: The Falcon went to heaven and brought the Soma to the Thunderer. 9 Deep in the ocean lies the bolt with waters compassed round about, And in continuous onward flow the floods their tribute bring to it.
10 When, uttering words which no one comprehended, Vak, Queen of Gods, the Gladdener, was seated, The heaven's four regions drew forth drink and vigour: now whither hath her noblest portion vanished? 11 The Deities generated Vak the Goddess, and animals of every figure speak her. May she, the Gladdener, yielding food and vigour, the Milch-cow Vak, approach us meetly lauded. 12 Step forth with wider stride, my comrade Vishnu; make room, Dyaus, for the leaping of the lightning.
Let us slay Vritra, let us free the rivers let them flow loosed at the command of Indra.
o Besides that, the arrow also indicates that Indra engenders a child. o And the womb symbolizes childbirth after nine month.



M-154
Three signs on this seal can be related to sentences from Rigveda 4-28:
o The unbarred door in the middle: ‘Heroes, ye burst the stable of the kine and horses, The stable which the bar or stone obstructed; and piercing through set free the habitations’. o The arrow symbolizes the fight of Indra against Vritra: ‘He cast down many a thousand with his arrow’. o The fish symbolizes the liberated waters: ‘Slew Ahi, and sent forth the Seven Rivers, and opened as it were obstructed fountains’.
Rigveda 4-28 called: ‘Indra-Soma’.
1. Allied with thee, in this thy friendship, Soma, Indra for man made waters flow together, Slew Ahi, and sent forth the Seven Rivers, and opened as it were obstructed fountains. 2 Indu, with thee for his confederate, Indra swiftly with might pressed down the wheel of Surya. What rolled, all life's support, on heaven's high summit was separated from the great oppressor. 3 Indra smote down, Agni consumed, O Indu, the Dasyus ere the noontide in the conflict. Of those who gladly sought a hard-won dwelling he cast down many a thousand with his arrow.
4 Lower than all besides hast thou, O Indra, cast down the Dasyus, abject tribes of Dasas. Ye drave away, ye put to death the foemen, and took great vengeance with your murdering weapons.
5 So, of a truth, Indra and Soma, Heroes, ye burst the stable of the kine and horses, The stable which the bar or stone obstructed; and piercing through set free the habitations.



M-1150
The inscription on this seal can be related to sentences from Rigveda 4-16:
o The elephant below is Indra: ‘Thou a wild elephant’. o The unbarred door on the left: ‘Disclosed the stall of cattle’. o The arrow indicates the fight of Indra against Vritra: ‘When the sharp-pointed arrow’ and ‘He smote away the floods obstructer, Vritra’. o The arrow also indicates his fertility o The two fish symbolizes the liberated waters: ‘Thou sentest forth the waters of the ocean’. o The two dashes symbolize: ‘grain’, ‘food’ or ‘wealth’: ‘Wishes for wealth have gone to Indra’.
Rigveda 4-16 called: ‘Indra’.
6 ‘Sakra who knoweth well all human actions hath with his eager Friends let loose the waters. They with their songs cleft e'en the mountain open and willingly disclosed the stall of cattle. 7 He smote away the floods' obstructer, Vritra; Earth, conscious, lent her aid to speed thy thunder. Thou sentest forth the waters of the ocean, as Lord through power and might, O daring Hero. (-) 14 What time thou settest near the Sun thy body, thy form, Immortal One, is seen expanding: Thou a wild elephant with might invested. like a dread lion as thou wieldest weapons. 15 Wishes for wealth have gone to Indra, longing for him in war for light and at libation, Eager for glory, labouring with praisesongs: he is like home, like sweet and fair nutrition. 16 Call we for you that Indra, prompt to listen, him who hath done so much for men's advantage; Who, Lord of envied bounty, to a singer like me brings quickly booty worth the capture. 17 When the sharp-pointed arrow, O thou Hero, flieth mid any conflict of the people, When, Faithful One, the dread encounter cometh, then be thou the Protector of our body’.
The last sign indicates childbirth in Sravana. This nakshatra is symbolized by three footprints: the three triangles. And the deity of this nakshatra is Vishnu: on the seal he is symbolized by the portal:
23; 20 Sravana (Ear) α, β and γ Aquilae Lord: Chandra (Moon)
Symbol : Ear or Three Footprints
Deity : Vishnu, preserver of universe

M-296 A
On this seal the signs below can be related to sentences from Rigveda 6-17:
o The unbarred door: ‘thou breakest through the cattle-stall’, and ‘Unbarred the firm doors for the kine of Morning’. o The arrow indicates the fight of Indra against Vritra: ‘Thou who, O Bold One, armed with thunder smotest Vritra’. o The arrow also indicate his fertility: ‘With this may we obtain strength Godappointed, and brave sons’. o The fish indicates the liberated waters: ‘Thou settest free the rushing wave of waters, the floods' great swell encompassed and obstructed’. o The two dashes symbolize: ‘grain’ and ‘food’: ‘make food abundant’.
Rigveda 6-17 called: ‘Indra’.
1. ‘Drink Soma, Mighty One, for which, when lauded, thou breakest through the cattle-stall, O Indra;Thou who, O Bold One, armed with thunder smotest Vritra with might, and every hostile being. (-) 3 Drink as of old, and let the draught delight thee. hear thou our prayer and let our songs exalt thee. Make the Sun visible, make food abundant, slaughter the foes, pierce through and free the cattle. (-) 6 Thou with thy wisdom, power, and works of wonder, hast stored the ripe milk in the raw
cows' udders. Unbarred the firm doors for the kine of Morning, and, with the Angirases, set free the cattle. (-) 11 He dressed a hundred buffaloes, O Indra, for thee whom all accordant Maruts strengthen. He, Pusan Vishnu, poured forth three great vessels to him, the juice that cheers, that slaughters Vritra. 12 Thou settest free the rushing wave of waters, the floods' great swell encompassed and obstructed. Along steep slopes their course thou tumedst, Indra, directed downward, speeding to the ocean. (-) 14 So, Indra, form us brilliant holy singers for strength, for glory, and for food and riches. Give Bharadvaja hero patrons, Indra Indra, be ours upon the day of trial.
15 With this may we obtain strength God-appointed, and brave sons gladden us through a hundred winters’.



M-296 A
According to the the Tolkāppiyam Murugan is identical with four different deities: Vishnu, Indra, Kali and Varnan.
1. Māyōṉ ‘the dark one’ (identified with Vishnu), 2. Vēntaṉ ‘the sovereign’ (identified with Indra) 3. And Korravai ‘the victorious’ (identified with Kali) 4. And Varunan ‘the sea god’.
‘In Tamil literature: The Tolkāppiyam, one of the most ancient texts of the Tamil literature, mentions cēyōṉ ‘the red one’, who is identified with Skanda, whose name is literally Murukaṉ ‘the youth’; the other gods referred to in the Tolkāppiyam are Māyōṉ ‘the dark one’ (identified with Vishnu), Vēntaṉ ‘the sovereign’ (identified with Indra) and Korravai ‘the victorious’ (identified with Kali) and Varunan ‘the sea god’.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kartikeyaa
So, Murugan is a fourfolt deity and on the above seal he is symbolized by the four circles at the corners of the square. His wife Shashthi is represented by the sixdivided circle.
Murugan is identified with Vishnu and Shashthi is the goddess of the moon. Vishnu is the deity of Sravana and the moon is its planet.

The arrow indicated that Indra engendered a child and the two signs indicate that this child was born in Sravana.



Number 1
Once again, on this seal Indra, the storm god seizes Vritra, the god of drought: in other words, thunderstorms with its lightning make the drought disappear.
Close to Harappa
http://en.allmetsat.com/climate/pakistan-afghanistan.php?code=41624
This table demonstrates that apart form July and August relatively much rain falls in the Harappa area in March: thunderstorms with its lightning drive away the drought. At the same time the rivers start rising because of the melting of the snow in the mountains. Because of these two phenomena the period of drought (winter) passes by.
‘In the month of July, the monsoon reaches its peak and produces heavy to very heavy rainfall. As in June, the sky remains overcast with only 3 to 4 hours of sunlight a day, with occasional drizzle at night or early morning. Two or three rainstorms that continue for few days are common in this month.’
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Karachi
This fact is incorporated into a myth, in which Indra, the storm god, defeats Vritra, the god of drought, and frees the rivers.

Number 1 MS 2645 Schoyen Collection ‘Impression of a rare Indus cylinder seal — a form more common to the Indus Valley's Mesopotamian trade partners than to Harappa itself. Found in this case in NW Afghanistan. As the Schoyen catalog description suggests, the iconography appears to be Old Akkadian, while the symbols are easily identified as being Indus. (The three rows of four strokes and the hoe or spearlike sign are familiar Indus symbols.) The two middle symbols or emblems, however (red arrows), are not found in any other inscription (out of a data base of perhaps by now 20,000+ [?] known instances of individual Indus emblem occurrences)’.
