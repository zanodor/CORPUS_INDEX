A once mightyfolk scattered among the nations
T
. SULIMIRSKI
By the beginning of the Christian era, the term Sarma
t
ia
appeared in ancient written records, replacing the name Scythia
given formerly to the eastern part of Europe. It derived from the
Sarmatians, a people which superseded the Scythians in the steppes
north of the Black Sea.
The Sarmatians seem to be at present a forgotten people, but in
antiquity they were a large and mighty folk, with whom the
Romans often had to fight. Their r61e in reshaping the ancient
European order at the turn of Antiquity and the Middle Ages,
and their contribution to mediaeval art were considerable although
usually ignored. Their impact on the Slavonic peoples was im
portant and lasting, and the vocabulary of almost all Slavonic
languages comprises many words of Sarmatian origin.
The Sarmatians were of Iranian stock, and were close relatives of the ancient Scythians, Medes and Parthians and also of the Persians; their language was related to that of Avesta. Herodotus,
the Greek historian of the 5 th century BC, mentions that ''they
used the Scythian language, speaking it corruptly'
. No Sarmatian written texts have come down to us, except a number of personal
names usually of their rulers. But the tongue of the Ossetians, in
the central part of the Caucasus, which has evolved out of the ancient Sarmatian-Alan dialects, can be considered to be modern Sarmatian.
Conditions in the steppes were never stable and the Sarmatians
were never a united people. Minor friction was constant between
tribes, and from time to time major wars drove a large group
from their areas to seek new pastures at the expense of other
neighbours, causing further disturbances. The movements call to
mind a billiard table on which one ball striking another stops in
putting the other in motion.
The Ancient Homeland of the Sarmatians The name under which the Sarmatians were mentioned for the first time by the ancient authors in the 5 th century BC was 'Sauro
matae'
. Herodotus says that their land lay 'three days journey, east of the Don, and 'three days journey' northwards from the Sea of Azov. Archaeological research has shown that they
extended over the wide grassland of the Eurasiatic border east of
the Don nearly up to the Ural river, and northwards along the
Volga up to Saratov. They were of mixed origin, combining
features of various Late Bronze Age cultures, particularly the
Maeotians and the Scythians, with whom the Sauromatae were in close contact. They had no permanent settlements. They lived on horseback
and their dwellings were wagons drawn by oxen. In their dress,
customs and culture they did not differ from the Scythians. They wore trousers and pointed caps. Their wives retained the 'ancient
Amazon' mode of living, joining their husbands in the hunt and
in war, and wearing the same dress as the men. No virgin was
permitted to marry until she had killed an enemy. However, the Sauromatae were not fated to live quietly in
their country, moving around from time to time with their herds
in search of fresh pastures. Events in central Asia during the
4th century BC had a great bearing on their further development.
In 331 Alexander the Great destroyed the Achaemenid Empire
of Persia. During the next two years he conquered Bactria and
Sogdiana, but did not succeed in subjugating the peoples further
north, the Chorasmians and the Massagetae. In fact the effect of
his conquests was to bring about a strong union of these two
peoples, and during the 3rd century BC they became the masters of all the nomad t
r
ibes of central Asia, and even the Huns, a
Turkish people who lived east of them up to the Chinese border,
had to acknowledge their suzerainty.
The culture of the Massagetae was typical of the steppe peoples
but was at the same time very strongly influenced by the Achae

ion of Persia. The extension of their rule, therefore, meant the spread of Achaemenian culture and ideas; the Sauro
matae were among the peoples profoundly affected by these.
Another innovation was the adoption of new warfare tactics and armour. The armour consisted of leather or material on which were sewn small copper or iron plaques; horses were protected in the same manner. The main weapons were long,
heavy lances held in a hooked bar
f
ixed to the horse's neck, and long iron swords. This cavalry fought in close array and no
adversary could resist it. The new tactics resulted in a reorgani
zation of all the armies in the east, even those of the Huns and the
Chinese. Light mounted archers were replaced by armoured
cavalry which became the typical Sarmatian war-formation. Even
the Romans were in the end forced to equip some of their units
in the same fashion.
A New Culture: the Royal Sarmatians Massagetdan-Chorasmian rule, or some sort of political depen
dence, had a profound effect on the old Sauromatian culture. It
began to lose its 'Scythian' characteristics and to acquire an
eastern, central Asiatic appearance, known as 'Early Sarmatian'. The transition seems to have started (early 4th century BC) in the region of Orsk-Chkalov in west Siberia, the area nearest to the
Massagetian border. Here, to judge from the diversity of the
furniture of the graves, was a society divided into social ranks
and even different racial groups. Grave-goods are mosdy of
Iranian, central Asiatic or oriental origin, but in the western part
of the area Greek imports have been found. Women were often
buried with arrowheads, which some authors consider to be a survival of ancient 'Amazon' (matriarchal) tradition. An entire carcass of a sheep or horse has often been found in richly furnished
graves; the animals always had the head removed.
By 3 3 8 BC the Sarmatians had crossed the Don. We know this
both from Greek histo
r
ical records (Pseudo-Scylax) and from archaeology. The region west of the Don had been occupied at the beginning of the 4th century by the Scythians, who had built
spectacular royal tombs in the Kuban valley in the north-western
Caucasus. At the end of the century the Scythians have disap
peared from the Kuban and are found much further west, on the
other side of the Dnieper. The implication is that they were
pushed westwards by advancing Sarmatians, who were doubtless

themselves under pressure from other Sarmatian tribes further
east. By 300 BC the Sarmatians controlled the whole area between
the Don and the Dnieper.
These Western Sarmatians were evidently united under a strong central leadership. Written records call them 'the Royal
Sarmatians'. A branch of the Scythians who had retreated into
the Crimea became their vassals and Olbia, a Greek city on the mouth of the S. Bug, paid them tribute. One of their kings, Galatus,
is mentioned in a peace treaty concluded about 179 BC i>y the
King of Pontus (in Turkey, south of the Black Sea) and a queen,
Amage, appears in the records some decades later. The only
f
inds that can be linked with the Royal Sarmatians are golden or silver gilt horse trappings (phalerae) dated to the 2nd
century BC. They have an embossed ornament, either geometrical
or in animal style reminiscent of ancient Assyrian or Ionian, but
at the same
t
ime closely connected with Graeco-Indian art. Phalerae of this type have been found at eleven sites mainly within pi 8
the presumed territory of the Royal Sarmatians. Two were found
outside that area, one in Transylvania, the other on the Danube in Bulgaria. The latter may be connected with a branch of the
Royal Sarmatians which under pressure from other Sarmatian
tribes had to retreat further west. For by this time the might of the Royal Sarmatians was near its end. Most of the population
presumably submitted to the newcomers; but at least some of
their tribes set off again on the migration westwards.
Outpost of the Greek World: the Bosporan Kingdom The Sarmatians who entered the Pontic steppe (the region beween the Don and the Danube) in the 4th century BC were the
f
irst to make direct contact with the classical world, in the shape
of the Bosporan kingdom. The origins of this kingdom go back
to the 6th century BC, when the Greeks founded several colonies
on the northern coast of the Black Sea. In the 5 th century BC the Bosporan kingdom embraced all colonies on the shores of the
Sea of Azov and a wide stretch of land along the eastern coast, inhabited at first by Maeotian but later by Sarma
t
ian, or Sarma
t
ized tribes.
The aim of the Bosporan state was to protect Greek cities from
seizure by the steppe nomads. But the Scythians and after them
the Sarma
t
ians were content to preserve the Greek cities and to
use them as commercial agents. Du
r
ing the Sarmatian period the Greek cities, and above all the Bosporan state, kept their position
as centres of production and exportation.
Its subsequent history may be briefly told. After absorbing successive waves of Sarmatian invasion, it was seized in 110 BC by Mithridates of Pontus, who involved it in his wars with Rome. A period of disorder followed, but by the mid-ist century AD
a new dynasty of mixed Sarmato-Thracian origin was established.
It ruled until the arrival of the Goths in the 3rd century AD. Members of this dynasty bore mainly Thracian or Sarma
t
ian names and 'Sauromates* was one of them. Rome exercised a nominal overlordship.
The wealthy middle classes, engaged mainly in trade and
industry, were chiefly of Greek origin, but a large proportion of
the population was indigenous, Maeotian, Scythian and Sarmatian,
only partly Hellenized. The official language was Greek and the
funeral ritual of the middle class shows that it t
r
ied to keep to
ancient Greek traditions. But desc
r
ip
t
ions by ancient authors of
the North Pontic ci
t
ies in the early Christian era, the sepulchral stelae with sculptural
f
igures and above all paintings in grave
chambers, show us Bosporans whose appearance was evidently
Sarma
t
ian. They wore trousers, soft leather shoes, long cloaks
probably of wool, etc., a thoroughly Scytho-Sarmatian dress. Their armour was Sarmatian too. Bosporan nobles are depicted
as cavalrymen with a conical metal helmet, a corselet of scale or ring armour, a long lance, a dagger fastened to the leg with a ring
at the top, a sword with a round stone pommel, a bow and bow
case (coryfus) and a small shield. The same armour has been found in Bosporan tombs of the period. The Sarmatians who appear on pi 1
Trajan's column (the Roxolani) or on the Arch of Galc
r
ius at f6
Salonica were clad and armed in the same manner. Infantry had
usually no corselets and were armed with lances, javelins, large
shields and sometimes a bow.

scattered among the nations
A tendrilkdfibula or brooch, ''with the foot turned over*, was one of the
most characteristic pieces of Sarmatian jewettery. They have been found
at sites asfar apart as the Votga, the Kuban and Poland. The one shown here is from eastern Germany. (3)
Masters of the Central Steppes: the Eastern Sarmatians The years between 174 and 160 BC were a turning-point in the
history of the Sarmatians who stayed in their original homeland
east of the Volga. Hitherto they had lived under the domination
of other peoples, chie
f
ly the Massagetae. Now the Massagetae
were defeated by the Huns, and the Sarmadans were able to shake themselves free. Remnants of the Massagetae were assimilated and the Sarmatians now had the Huns as their eastern
neighbours. Their might is well illustrated by the ar
r
ival, in
125 BC, of a Chinese legadon which tried to incite the Sarmatians
against the Huns, in order to relieve Hunnic pressure on the
Chinese borders.
The result of these changes was a transformation of the Sarma
tian culture, which reaches a new period in its development called
the Middle Sarmatian period. It was a time of uni
f
ication, and
obliteration of regional differences. Grave goods from all over
the Sarma
t
ian ter
r
itory east of the Volga show only minor varia
tions. Long swords become less frequent and were gradually
replaced by short swords and daggers with a ring on the top of
the hilt instead of a pommel. Spear-heads, or lance-heads, were an
exception. By the end of the period (2nd century AD) the Eastern
Sarmatians were no longer heavy armed cavalry: they were
primarily armed with a new, more effective bow introduced by
the Huns and designed to combat the cavalry that had previously
been invincible. The new bow was strengthened by bone inlays and fired a heavy arrow with three-edged head. It was this inven
tion that eventually gave the Huns superiority over all their
adversaries.
Many of the grave goods bear witness to strong ties with
Central Asiatic count
r
ies: mirrors, bone spoons, jewellery, horse harness, red-coloured pottery of Kushan type and distinctive jugs
with a handle in the shape of an animal. On the other hand, graves
in the lower Volga show connections with the Bosporan kingdom
-fibulae of various types made sometimes of silver, including the
f 3 'tendrilled type with the foot turned over*, glass, carnelian and
amber beads, Egyptian-type faience pendants and amulets, wheel
made pottery, etc. Small bronze plaques (sometimes golden) sewn
on to garments are common to the whole Sarmatian territory.
Gold apart from plaques is rare. Fragments of sheep's bones are often found in a dish or bowl, but entire carcasses are now an
exception.
The best known of the Middle Sarmatians are those who
migrated across the Dnieper and began pressing upon the fron
tiers of Rome. Two groups, however, remained nearer to their
ancestral homelands and may conveniently be desc
r
ibed first.
The Aorsi, living mainly to the east of the Volga, were the
most remote. After the defeat of the Massagetae they increased in
strength and became a mighty people, mentioned in Chinese
annals of c. ijo BC (where they are said to have had 100,000
archers as their fighting force), and by the Greek geographer
Strabo (early ist century AD), who says that an important trade
route ran through their territory and they could 'a
f
ford to wear gold ornaments'
.
A branch of the Aorsi (probably fugitives from the main group)
settled west of the Volga, around the lower Don, and it was here,
pi 19 at Novocherkassk, that the most splendid of all Middle Sarmatian
22 graves was excavated in 1864. It was the grave of a woman,
probably a tribal chief or queen. Grave goods included at least
thirteen gold objects, mostly decorated in the animal style and
studded with precious stones-turquoise, amethyst and coral.
There were richly ornamented diadems, bracelets, perfume
bottles, cases and jugs. One of the latter had a zoomorphic handle
(a stag) of the same type as those of the clay jugs in ordinary
Sarmatian graves. There were also hundreds of small plaques sewn on to garments. In the middle of the ist century AD the Aorsi lost their leading
position among the Eastern Sarmatians and were replaced by the
Alans (see p. 294).
The Siraces of the Kuban
The second group, the Siraces, lived further to the south, in the
valley of the Kuban and the steppes immediately north of it. They
were not a large people. Strabo says that their king Abeacus had
at his disposal in c. 66-65 only 20,000 horsemen, whereas
Spadines, King of the Aorsi, who bordered them to the north,
had 200,000.
During the dynastic feuds of the Bosporan kingdom, the
Siraces became involved in Mithridates' wars against Rome.
They became tributaries of Rome in the 1 st century AD, but were soon conquered by the Alans, and do not appear in written re
cords after the 2nd century. They were partly nomad wagon-dwellers, partly tent-dwellers
and farmers. Large numbers of their permanent setdements,
usually hill-forts, are recorded in the Kuban valley. Houses were
built of beaten clay, and the inhabitants practised agriculture
wheat, barley and millet and animal husbandry. Cattle, horses,
sheep and pigs were reared, and fishing was an important part of
their economy. It was a severely stratified society. At the top were kings and
princes, beneath them a series of social classes, differing widely in
wealth and privilege. Our knowledge of Siracian life comes
chiefly from their graves, which were of two types-the 'flat'
cemeteries where the majority of the people were buried, and the
princely 'barrow graves', con
f
ined to the upper classes.
The largest of the 'flat' cemete
r
ies is at Ust-Labinska. Here a va
r
iety of grave goods has come to light. The pottery is mainly a
wheel-made ware-bowls, vessels with spherical body etc.-but
most characteris
t
ic are jugs with handles in the form of animals,
or at least the top of the handle in the shape of an animal head.
Jugs of this type were common among the Sarmatians on the
lower Volga and the steppes further east. They were probably
adapted from Central Asiatic peoples, where jugs with zoomor
phic handles were common from the 2nd century BC. Weapons were more numerous than before. There are daggers
and swords of two types-either long and narrow, or short,
double-edged and pointed. Iron spear-or lance-heads are common.
Socketed arrow-heads are replaced by three-edged tanged points.
jewellery is also plentiful, including the characte
r
istic 'Sarma
tian' tcndni-fibulae of the so-called 'type with foot turned over', f 3
and the fibulae of arbalest type. Mirrors were usually decorated. In
richly furnished graves there are imported goods-glass vessels,
terra sigillata bowls, beads made of glass, paste and semi-precious pi 5
stones, and Egyp
t
ian scarahei and similar figurines.
In most graves animal bones were excavated, the remains of
food for the journey into the next world: mainly sheep, seldom cow or pig. Occasionally there are complete skeletons, chie
f
ly cows, seldom horses. Of the p
r
incely barrow-graves the best known are at Ust
Labinska (situated in the vicinity of the flat cemetery), Vozdvizhenskaya, Armavir and Zubovskii. They consist usually of small
mounds with a grave-shaft (with niche) underneath. Some
t
imes a man is buried alone, sometimes a man and woman together. The
grave-goods do not differ much from those of the flat cemeteries, but there is a profusion of gold objects and goods imported from
distant countries. Another difference is that all the princely burials
are of horsemen.
The principal weapons were heavy, long lances and long swords
with a wooden hilt, oval in section, topped by a round or square
pommel of some precious or semi-precious stone. Both men and
horses wore corselets, but by the end of the ist century AD the
sealed corselet is replaced by ring-armour. Conical helmets have
291



A once mighty folk
been found in several graves. Bows and arrows played a second
ary r61e in the armament of these knights. Their horse-trappings
differed from those of the Scythian period, but phalerae were still
in use. The bits had simple rings.
Jewels and ornaments have been recovered in quantity-torques,
fibulae of the same type as those in the flat graves, diadems and
bracelets. Belt-buckles and clasps are mostly open-work, often
with coloured filling. The polychromy (related to Persian gold
smiths' work) considerably modi
f
ied the animal style by
f
illing
the bodies of the animals with gems and cut pieces of coloured
glass, enclosing them in a coloured frame.
Very characteristic are small thin metal, usually gold, plaques
sewn on cloth, hundreds of which have been excavated from Kuban barrow-graves. They differ from those of the Scythian pe
r
iod in being very small, their shapes geometric-rounds, trian
gles, crescents, rosettes, etc. All are of O
r
iental type.
Some of the goods mentioned are products of Bosporan workshops, but others are of local Siracian manufacture. Others again
come from even further afield-Greek goods imported through
the Bosporan town of Panticapaeum (Kerch), and Oriental luxu
ries (especially beads) reaching the Siracian country by the cara
van routes desc
r
ibed by Strabo. Iranian and Indian ideas, as well
as jewellery, must also have followed the same route, consider
ably influencing the Siracian culture and that of other Sarma
t
ian
tribes.
Two objects from Kuban barrow-graves are of Greek origin
and can be dated 6th century BC, i.e. six centuries or so before the graves in which they were found. According to an insc
r
iption
on one of them they originally belonged to the temple of Apollo at Phasis. They were evidently looted during an incursion south
of the Caucasus.
The Great Migrations When the Sarmatians burst upon the frontiers of the Roman Empire in the i st century AD they were already split up into t
r
ibes
with distinct names, and it is by these names that they are usually mentioned by Roman historians. The most famous are the lazyges, the Roxolani and the Alani. Their relations with Rome and
with each other are now fairly well understood, but before examining the story in detail it is helpful to have a picture of the great
migratory movements of Eastern Europe as a whole.
Sarmatian history consists of a se
r
ies of waves moving from
east to west, each pushing and being pushed, until they reach the
barrier of Rome and break up into yet more complex eddies and
cross-currents.
f 4 The first wave-the vanguard of the Sarmatians-was the
lazyges. In the 2nd century BC they lived north-west of the Sea of Azov between the Dnieper and the Don. Behind them (i.e. to
the east) were the Roxolani; in front of them a non-Sarmatian people, the Bastarnae. Pressure from the Roxolani pushed the lazyges across the Dnieper up to the Dniester (early 1st century
BQ and then to the Danube delta, the fron
t
ier of Rome. The
f
irst recorded
f
ighting between Sarmatians and Romans took place in
78 BC. By AD 20 the lazyges had crossed the Carpathians and
settled in the Hungarian Plain. Here the war with Rome went on,
with va
r
ious shifts in the situation (sometimes the lazyges sided
with Rome against later Sarmatians) for 400 years. Then they dis
appear from history, squeezed into oblivion by pressures too
great to be resisted.
At their heels came the Roxolani. In their 'starting-position'
(2nd century BC) they lived east of the Don. Their movements
closely follow those of the lazyges-across the Dnieper (early 1st
century AD), at war with Rome (AD 62). After these large-scale movements came a lull. The place of the
lazyges and the Roxolani in the steppes north of the Black Sea is
f
illed by the Aorsi and the Siraces, who, as we have seen, attained a high degree of civiliza
t
ion and did not at once follow their com
patriots to the west. The current, however, had not stopped. In
the 1st century AD they were subdued by a new tribe from east
of the Don-the Alans. The resulting mixture of tribes is referred
to by ancient writers as either(Alanorsi' (i.e. Alan-Aorsi) or West
ern Alans'
. But the Alans, instead of repeating the familiar pat
tern and adding to the tension on the Roman border, expanded

south into the Caucasus, west into Bessarabia and north-west into Poland.
In the early 3rd century AD came a new threat, this time from the north-the Goths,
f
ighting their way from the Baltic to the
Black Sea. In 332 they captured the 'Sarmatized' Bosporan kingdom. Later they too joined the march against Rome.
Finally the ultimate enemy-the Huns. The greatest of the Go
thic kingdoms-the Ostrogoths-broke under the Hunnic on
slaught in 375, crossed the Danube and allied themselvces (temporarily) with Rome. This was virtually the end of the Sarmatians as a distinct people. Split into smaller and smaller units, dispersed in many unconnected regions, they had little chance of maintain
ing their national identity and were doomed to be absorbed by either their successive conquerors or the subdued peoples in the country of their retreat. There are a few par
t
ial exceptions which
will be described-the Alans in the Caucasus and some small
groups in the Ukraine and Bessarabia. But 'Sarmatia' had ceased
to exist.
With this summary in mind we can return to the first of the Sarmatian tribes to make its impact on the West, the lazyges.
The Invasion of the West: the lazyges The earliest history of the lazyges is unknown. They may have
been identical with the 'Royal Sarma
t
ians'. But around the beginning of the Christian era they are mentioned by Strabo and
then by Tacitus as living between the Dnieper and Dniester, and
ruling over a Cel
t
ic people called the Bastarnae. Tacitus says
about the Bastarnae that *in consequence of frequent intermar
riages between their leading families and the families of Sarmatia,
they have been tainted with the manners of that country'
. No ar
chaeological remains of the lazyges have been found in the Pon
tic area, in spite of the fact that they lived for at least a century in
the region close to the Sea of Azov and for another century in the steppes west of the Dnieper.
In their migra
t
ion westwards the lazyges came first to the Dan
ube delta, an outpost of the kingdom of Dacia, centred on mod
ern Transylvania. On the other side of the river was the Roman province of Moesia. The lazyges allied themselves with Mithridates Eupator of Pontus (in Asia Minor) in his war against Rome.
We hear that in 78-76 BC a punitive expedi
t
ion was undertaken
by the Romans against the lazyges north of the Danube, obviously in connection with an incursion of theirs into Roman territory. It was the
f
irst of many encounters. The lazyges were to become
familiar adversaries. Ovid, who was banished to Torn! (modem Constanta) in AD 8, has left several desc
r
iptions of them.
The way south was blocked, but the way west still lay open.
Soon after AD 20 the lazyges crossed the Carpathians and settled
in the Hungarian Plain between the Theiss and the Danube. The
Dacian tribes that were already there had to pay them tribute. The
Roman province of Pannonia now faced them to the west, but

instead of trying to invade it at once they seem to have come to an
agreement with the Romans and received subsidies in return for
service as auxiliaries. They were on the Roman side in the Dacian wars of Trajan (AD 85-88 and 101) but raided Roman Moesia
at the same time.
The earliest remains of the lazyges date from this period. Their
graves were
f
lat and were grouped into large cemeteries. They
were poorly furnished: clay vessels, some
t
imes an iron knife,
beads, occasionally a brooch and exceptionally a short iron sword
with a ring at the top of the hilt. The influence of the subdued in
digenous population is illustrated by brooches and arm-rings of
La Tene type. A few early graves contain objects of Pon
t
ic origin
(e.g. decorated gold plaques sewn to garments) but these soon
die out, which implies a break between the lazyges and the North
Pontic lands from which they came.
The Fight on the Frozen Danube Trajan had made Da,cia into a Roman province with the aid of the
lazyges, but in AD 117 this peaceful arrangement was broken.
Hadrian had to defend Dacia against the lazyges from the west
and the Roxolani from the east (see p. 294). The lazyges continued
sporadically at war with Rome for the next fifty years. In AD 169
they crossed the Danube and invaded Pannonia, only to be sever
ely beaten by Marcus Aurelius. Dio Cassius has left us a vivid
desc
r
iption of the battle between the Romans and the fleeing Sar
matians on the frozen Danube. The lazyges, expecting easily to overcome the pursuing Romans once they were on the ice, turned
back on them. In response the Romans formed a compact body,
laid their shields
f
lat and placed one foot upon them in order to
reduce the chance of slipping, 'and thus they received the enemy's
charge. Some seized the bridles, others the shields and spear
shafts of their assailants, and drew the men towards them; and thus, becoming involved in close con
f
lict, they knocked down
both men and horses, since the barbarians, by reason of their mo
mentum, could no longer keep from slipping. The Romans also
slipped, but those who fell on their back would drag their adver
saries down on top of them, while those that fell forward actually
seized their antagonists, who had fallen first, with their teeth. For
the barbarians, being unused to a conflict of this sort, and having
lighter equipment, were unable to resist, so that but few escaped
out of a large force.'
In AD 175 peace was concluded, Marcus taking the title 'Sar
maticus' and his victories being celebrated in Imperial coinage. Hard condi
t
ions were imposed on the lazyges. They were required
to dwell far away from the Danube and had to contribute 8,000 cavalry to the Roman army, 5,500 of whom were sent to Britain.
These Sarmatians in Britain were distributed through the north
ern frontierland in units of 500. Traces of them have so far been discovered at three sites. In the Roman fort at Chesters on Ha
d
r
ian's wall, an eye-shield from a cataphract horse was found, probably Sarmatian, and also a number of beads typical of the
Sarmatians in Hungary. There is a funeral stele showing a Sarmatian
horseman at Chester, and in the ancient fort of Bremetennacum at Ribchester near Lancaster, inscriptions bear witness to a Sarma
t
ian
cavalry unit 500 strong. Nothing is known about the fate of these men, but at least some
of them never returned to their homeland. A settlement of veterans was established at Bremetennacum; it never became a real town, but it was still in existence in the early 5 th century AD. In Dacia the war broke out again only two years after the peace
just described, and the lazyges obtained some mitigation of the
former conditions. They were allowed to sail on the Danube in their own boats and to communicate with the Roxolani who dwelt cast of Dacia. They were anxious to maintain relations with these, since it was through them that they were able to provide them
selves with beads and other commodities of eastern origin which
were their most common grave-goods.
Conflict with Rome continued intermittently. We hear of the
lazyges losing a war in AD 236-238, raiding Dacia in 248-250
and Pannonia in 2 5 4. They were evidently a strong people whom
the Romans were unable to subdue permanently. Archaeological
remains from this period (c. AD 160-260) are plentiful. The
lazyges seem to have gone on living a nomadic, pastoral life. A
new feature in graves is the so-called 'herdsmen's bag'-an assem
blage consisting of an iron knife, iron awl,
f
ire-stone and
f
lint, and
sometimes a whetstone. The ruling classes continued to be bu
r
ied in barrow-graves, of which a notable example has been found at
Szil in the centre of Roman Pannonia. It is possibly the grave of
a Sarmatian prince who fell in battle during an incursion in the 2nd century AD. By the middle of the 5rd century the position of the lazyges had
decisively deteriorated. In 260 the Goths had entered Dacia, which the Romans could no longer defend, and in 271 had estab
lished the powerful kingdom of the Visigoths. But in spite of
this danger on their eastern border the lazyges continued their
raids into Pannonia, until the Romans
f
inally decided to finish them. Between AD 290 and 313, eight successive Roman expeditions entered and devastated their territory, after which the Emperor Galerius Maximus and his successors, Constantine and Lici
nius took the title 'Sarma
t
icus'.
Roman punitive expeditions had not broken the Sarmatians but
had considerably weakened them. They were no longer in a po
sition to resist the Visigoths who attacked them in AD 321. But the Visigoths, after beating the lazyges, crossed their ter
r
itory
and invaded Pannonia. Their incursion ended in a great victory
for Constantine in 322. The Gothic king was slain and the lazyges were saved. The renewed activity of the lazyges at the beginning of this
pe
r
iod (AD 260-330), to which the Romans reacted so strongly,
seems to have been connected with internal changes, most probably a new wave of immigrants from the east. The contents of
the graves seem to indicate three distinct layers of society-a low
er class, possibly the indigenous conquered Slavs; a middle
class, perhaps the first wave of lazyges; and a ruling upper-class, the 5rd century newcomers. Graves of the first group are without
weapons; the second, consisting of careful cof
f
in burials, contain
'herdsmen's bags', personal ornaments and a few iron swords and
Roman coins; the third are barrow-graves, furnished with weapons, horses, and fine Pon
t
ic jewellery. A par
t
icularly interes
t
ing
barrow-grave, dating from about AD 500, has been found at
Herpaly, on the eastern fringe of lazygian territory. Here a Sar
matian warrior was buried with his horse; in the grave were characteris
t
ic Sarma
t
ian beads and a fine shield buckle covered with a gold-plated silver sheet decorated in the Pon
t
ic style. The shield
buckle was of Teutonic type.
The final stage of the lazyges began about AD 532. A disas
trous civil war broke out amongst them, ending with the flight of
one whole tribe, the Ardagarantes, partly to the Goths, partly to
the Romans. The remainder were again beaten, this time by Constantius in 3 5 8, and, after an attempt at peaceful settlement, massacred.
Figh
t
ing went on through the end of the 4th century AD. In
the early 5th century came the Huns. By about 432 they were masters of most the Hungarian plain, having subjugated the Goths
and what was left of the Sarmatians. But after the death of At
t
ila (45 3) the Sarma
t
ians freed themselves from Hunnic rule, and there are again records of clashes between them and the Romans, In
472 they were beaten by Theodoric, king of the Visigoths, and
two Sarmatian kings, Beukan and Babai, fell in battle.
This seems to be the last reference in written records to the
Hungarian Sarmatians, the descendants of the lazyges who had
arrived 5 00 years before. They had gained the name of 'Latrunculi* (free-booters, robbers) and one histo
r
ian says that they were
'a tribe most accomplished in brigandage.' Yet they were suf
f
iciently formidable for six Roman emperors to take the title 'Sar
ma
t
icus' after defeating them, and special coins were several times
minted to commemorate victories over them.
The Roxolani: 'Impetuous, Fierce and irresistible* The Roxolani, the next great t
r
ibe of Sarmatians to reach the
West, crossed the Don in the mid-2nd century BC. They first ravaged the country and then settled north of the lazyges in the
steppes between the Don and the Dnieper. They must have partly
subdued the 'Royal Sarma
t
ians' and partly forced them to move
west of the Dnieper.
About 110 BC they became involved in Black Sea politics, first

allying themselves with the Scythians against the Bosporan
Pon
t
ic alliance and then, after being defeated by Diophantes of
Pontus, aiding the Pontic army in its conquest of the Bosporan
kingdom. Their defeat in the first campaign is described by Stra
bo. They were 50,000 men strong and had the reputa
t
ion of being
warlike, but were light-armed and could not stand against a well
ordered and well-armed phalanx. They used helmets and corslets
of raw hide, carried wicker shields and had for weapons spears,
bows and swords. By the middle of the 1st century AD, as part of a much larger
movement of the tribes, the Roxolani had moved west of the
Dnieper. From here part of them seem to have settled between the Dnieper and the Danube delta (ousting the lazyges, who were
there before), but the bulk of them went further south and by AD 62 had arrived in the plains of southern Roumania. We have a description of them by Strabo of about this time (AD 17-23). He
calls them 'the wagon-dwellers'. <Their tents made of felt were
fastened to the wagons in which they spent their lives. Round
about the tents were the herds which afforded the milk, cheese
and meat on which they lived. They followed the grazing herds,
from time to time moving to other places that had grass.' He also says that they are Warriors rather than b
r
igands, yet they go to
war only for the sake of the tributes due to them. They turn over
their land to any people who wish to till it, and are satis
f
ied if they
receive in return a tribute for the land, which is a moderate one.
But when tenants do not pay, they go to war with them.' Their
horses, like those of the Scythians, were exceedingly quick and
hard to manage, they therefore castrated them. They also hunted deer and wild boar in the marshes, and wild asses and roe deer in the steppes. We know from their grave goods that they had iron swords,
small iron arrow-heads, and quivers of birch-bark-the weapons
of light-armed mounted archers. According to andent descrip
tions, they lassoed their enemies in battle. As soon as they arrived on the Danube the Roxolani invaded Roman Moesia. They were hurled back, but thousands of
'Transdanubian* (presumably Dacian) fugitives sought shelter in
the Roman province and were allowed to settle there. Tacitus has
left a vivid-if hostile-description of the Roxolani as they ap
peared to their Roman neighbours. 'Plunder, and not war, is their
passion,* he writes, 1-a band of freebooters, determined to ra
vage the country . . . Their courage has no inward principles, but
depends altogether upon external circumstances ... In an engagement with the infantry nothing can be more dastardly; in an onset
of the cavalry they are impetuous, fierce and irresistible. Their
weapons are long spears or sabres of enormous size, which they wield with both hands. The chiefs wear coats of mail, formed with plates of iron, or the tough hides of animals, impenetrable
to the enemy but to themselves an encumbrance so unwieldy
that he who falls in the battle is never able to rise again.' In the winter of AD 69 the Roxolani again invaded Moesia
and annihilated the Legio III Gallica. But they were soon taken
by surprise by another Roman army and severely punished, a
heavy fall of rain and a sudden thaw having deprived them of all
advantage from the speed of their horses. In AD 85-86 they at
tacked Moesia yet again, and in the Dacian wars of Trajan they
fought on the Dacian side (the lazyges, it will be remembered,
were on the side of the Romans). When Trajan celebrated his triumph in AD 107, captive Roxolani were led with Dacians
through the streets of Rome. On Trajan's column we can see a
detachment of Roxolani archers on horseback fleeing before the
victorious Romans, and their armour exactly answers the description given by Tacitus. After the Dacian wars they were given a subsidy on condi
t
ion
that they kept away from Roman frontiers. In AD 117 the subsidy was discontinued; another war ensued, Hadrian, Trajan's succes
sor, had to leave Rome to quell the disturbance, and the subsidy
was renewed. In AD 118 the king of the Roxolani became a Ro
man vassal.
Thereafter the Roxolani suffered eclipse. The Goths, as we
have seen, wrested Dacia from the Romans in AD 271. During
the 3rd and 4th centuries there are many records of raids by Sarmatians into Roman territory, o
f
ten undertaken jointly with the
Goths, but the identity of the Sarmatian tribes taking part is left
doubtful. Those depicted on the Arch of Galerius at Salonica
(AD 297), for example, may be Roxolani, but may equally well / 6
be Alans.
In AD 377 those Roxolani who s
t
ill remained in the Roumanian plain east of the Danube had to abandon the country under pres
sure from the Ostrogoths, who, in turn, were then retrea
t
ing be
fore the Huns. Some of the Roxolani sought refuge in Roman
Moesia, others retreated further west, and joined the lazyges in
the Hungarian plain.
New Tribes from the East-the Western Alans
The last great migratory movement of the Sarma
t
ian people was
that of the large group known as the Alans (Alani). In its numer- / /
ous ramifications, this tribe was once to be found in almost every country of Europe, from the Volga to Spain.
By the middle of the 1st century AD the Alans had won the upper hand over all the eastern Sarmatian tribes. In 68 they were
reported in the vicinity of the Sea of Azov, and by the beginning
of the second century they were masters of the whole ter
r
itory
previously held by the Aorsi and the Siraces. Some of the Aorsi moved west; others accepted Alanic rule and, merging with them, became the 'Western Alans'. The Siraces too seem to have retreated west. In the steppes of the lower Dniester, in the Ukraine and
Bessarabia, are found
r
ichly furnished barrow-graves exactly si
milar to those built earlier by the Siraces in the Kuban. They date from the 2nd and 3rd centu
r
ies AD and seem to be the burials of Siracian princelings displaced by the Alans before the ar
r
ival of
the Goths. Grave-goods include a bronze mirror, a bronze kettle
with zoomorphic handles, vessels of Gallic or Pannonian o
r
igin, richly decorated horse-harness and an iron battle-axe. The Alans' first attempts at further expansion were to the south.
They invaded Parthia in AD 73 and Roman Asia Minor in 123. Both attacks were repelled. In AD 133 they invaded Media, ad
vancing along the western coast of the Caspian and crossing the narrow passage of Derbent. The historian Josephus has left an
account of the Alans in battle. 'They came in great mul
t
itudes and
fell upon the Medes unexpectedly and plundered their country without opposi
t
ion.' Pecorus, the king of the Medes, had
f
led
and 'had yielded everything he had to them, and had only saved
his wife and his concubines by giving them a hundred talents
for their ransom.' The Alans then entered Armenia, where they were met by King Tiridates. In the battle which followed, the king
was lassoed by an Alan, and failing to cut the cord with his sword was drawn to his captor and slain. The Alans subsequently 'laid
waste the country and drove a great multitude of men, and a great

quantity of other prey they had gotten, out of both kingdoms
along with them and retreated back to their own country.' The Ukrainian steppes east of the Dnieper also fell under Ala
nic power. But before they could reach Dacia and add to the pres
sures already being exerted on the Roman border they had to face
a new threat from the north.
The Goths move South
There is no exact agreement about the date at which the Goths
reached the Black Sea area. About AD 230 seems appropriate, and archaeological evidence supports the assumption that they
came along the Dnieper from their former home on the Baltic
coast.
About AD 250 they captured Olbia, the city under Roman pro
tection at the mouth of the S. Bug. The Bosporan kingdom, stM
under nominal Roman superiority, was subdued; in 352 Bospo
ran coins ceased to be minted. The last Bosporan king was Rhes
kuporis IV who died in 361/2.
The eastern reach of the Goths, or the Ostrogothic Empire,
has been put usually on the Don. Archaeological evidence sug
gests that it extended only to the Dnieper, or slightly east of that
river in the steppes, and only a relatively narrow strip north of the
Sea of Azov was in possession of the Goths.
The conquest of the steppes and the seizure of the almost com
pletely Sarmatized Bosporan kingdom had an enormous effect
on the culture of the Ostrogoths, leading it to acquire many Sar
matian characteristics. The
f
ine Bosporan workshops began to
supply the new customers, adapting the old Sarmato-Bosporan
pi 23 models of jewellery to the taste of their new masters, and adding
some elements brought by the newcomers. The new *Gothic,
art which thus developed spread later over the whole of Central
and Western Europe, carried and promoted by the Goths and other peoples, including the Sarmatians, retreating before the
Huns.
The most westerly branch of the Alans, at the time of the Gothic invasions, lived in the northern half of Bessarabia and the adjoining part of Moldavia on the other side of the Pruth. Here
the population was mainly Slavonic, but the Alans must have
constituted the dominant class since the country is referred to by contemporary writers as 'Alania* and the Pruth is called 'the Alan
river' (Alanus
f
luvius). This group of Alans may almost certainly
be identified with the Antae who are recorded as living there in the 4th century AD.
There is an interesting description of the Alans by Ammianus
Marcellinus in the 4th century AD which is almost identical with that given of the Sauromatae eight hundred years earlier by Hero
dotus. It seems that the centuries had had little effect on the mode
of life and habits of the steppe nomads.
pi 3 Ammianus Marcellinus says the 'Halani' (the Alans) 'live upon
f
lesh and abundance of milk. They have no huts but dwell in wa
gons with rounded canopies of bark. They drive over the bound
less wastes and in places rich in grass they place their carts in a circle, to move again as soon as the fodder is used up. Wagons
form their permanent dwellings, in which they live and their ba
bies are born and reared. Wherever they come, that place they
look upon as their natural home.
'They drive their cattle before them and pasture them with
their
f
locks, but give particular attention to breeding horses. All The 'Tomgo* Signs
aged and women unfit for war remain close by the wagons. The
young men grow in the habit of riding from their earliest boy
hood, and regard it as contemptible to go on foot.'
Almost all the Alans, he says, were tall and handsome, their
hair inclining to blond; 'by the ferocity of their glance they inspire
dread.' They were light and active in the use of arms. 'In their
manner of life and their habits they are less savage than the Huns.
They delight in danger and warfare. The man who falls in battle
is judged happy, while those who grow old and die by natural
death they assail with bitter reproaches as degenerate and cow
ardly. They take pride in killing any man whatever and as glo
rious spoils of the slain they tear off their heads, then strip off
their skins and hang them upon their war-horses as trappings/
As their god of war they worshipped a naked sword fixed in
the ground. 'They have a remarkable way of divining the future.

Sarmatian soldiers depicted on the Jirch of Galerius at Salonica (erected AD 29j). Galerius> later co-emperor with Constantius, was in command on the Dacianfrontier around the turn of the 3rd century. The Sarmatians in this relief are serving in the Roman army and are equipped with typically Sarmatian arms and armoury but it is impossible to say from
what tribe they come. (6)
They gather very straight twigs of osier and sort them out at an
appointed time with certain secret incantations and thus clearly
learn what is impending.* They did not have slaves, 'they all are bom of noble blood'. They chose as chiefs 'those men who are conspicuous for long experience as warriors.'
Alanic graves in Bessarabia and Moldavia contain typical furni
ture of Sarmatian burials-bronze rings and other personal ornaments, necklaces of glass or carnelian beads, occasionally an iron
sword and once a Roman imported glass beaker. Of par
t
icular
signi
f
icance are some bronze mirrors (and one stone slab) en
graved with 'tamga' signs, proving that the earlier home of these
Sarmatians must have been the Sea of Azov close to the Bosporan kingdom.
These 'tamga* signs are especially interesting because they are the /7
Sarma
t
ians' closest approach to a written script. Scholars disagree
about their precise meaning and function. Some are of the opi- pi 24
nion that they had a magical purpose, others consider them to be 27
property-signs which later, in the Middle Ages, developed in
some countries into the coats-of-arms of the nobility and in others, e.g. in the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia, retained their
old meaning of family or clan property-crests. There is likewise
no agreement as to their origin, which has often been sought in
Iran.
The recent work of E. I. Solomonik provides a list of 160 ob
jects with 'tamga' signs found in the USSR. This reveals that over
half of the 'tamgas' were found within the Bosporan kingdom,
mainly at Kerch (Panticapaeum) and another 20 at Chersoncsus
and Olbia; thus about two-thirds of all known 'Sarmatian' signs
295

were found within Greek territory. Of the remainder about twothirds were found in the Crimea and the Kuban valley, both regions strongly affected by Bosporan influence. Only one-eighth
of the total were found within Sarmatian territory proper, and
only three were traced east of the Volga.
This distribution, and the fact that they do not appear until the
1 st century AD, implies that 'tamga* signs must hiave originated
in the Bosporan kingdom and were a Greek invention. The signs
at Kerch and other Greek cities were either carved or incised on
grave stelae, in grave chambers, or appear as open-work on belt
buckles and clasps. The earliest of these represent monograms of
three Greek deities: Apollo, Helios and Dionysos, all connected both with the cult of the sun and with belief in an after-life. Later the rigidity of the design slackened, details were omitted and the monograms simpli
f
ied; finally only a few characteristic features served to recall the original patterns, but the derivation is still
recognizable.
The 'tamga' signs were adopted by the Sarmatians who lived
close to the Bosporan kingdom, the Siraces and the Aorsi. The
few objects found outside this region are obviously of Bosporan
or Kuban origin. The more or less simplified 'tamgas' found fur
ther west in late assemblages were evidently connected with the
migration of those Sarmatian tribes which adopted the signs.
The signs had a religious or magic meaning. Those on grave
stelae and in tombs had to guide and guard the deceased in the
after-life. Those on cauldrons, mirrors and belt-buckles had to
protect their owners, and after the conversion to Christianity were replaced by the cross or Christ's monogram. Their tradition
in this respect was continued in the Middle Ages by the belt buck
les with a representation of aiestas Domini'.
But the old 'Sarmatian' signs which lost their meaning after the
conversion, were not abandoned but gradually acquired the cha
racter of property signs or family crests, and finally, in mediaeval
Kievan Russia and in Poland, entered into heraldry. In Poland,
especially, they survived for an amazingly long time. Many coats
of-arms of the i2th-i4th centuries are identical with 'tamgas';
other later examples show stylized versions in the form of crescents, arrows, horseshoes, crosses, etc. The Antae in Bessarabia, in spite of conflict with the Goths,
seem to have resisted any pressure to move further west and even
to have extended their rule eastwards. In the 5 th and 6th centuries we find them ruling over the whole Ukrainian forest-steppe zone
west of the Dnieper, and also east of that
r
iver. They had prob
ably taken advantage of the downfall of the Ostrogoths under
Hunnic onslaught and enlarged their dominion. The centre of
their power was now transferred to the region of Kiev. By this
time they had become so completely 'Slavicized' that ancient writ
ers refer to them as Slavs. But Byzantine sources of the 6th century still dis
t
inguish them from all remaining Slavs, though they
emphasize that they spoke the same language.
Drama
t
ic traces of this last period of the Antae have been
discovered. At Pastyrske, near Kanev, is an earthwork which
probably defended the capital of one of their kings. At the end
of the 6th or the beginning of the yth century the Antae were
over-run by a new wave of eastern nomads, the Turkish Avars. Before
f
leeing, the ruling families managed to conceal hoards of
silver which they were never able to reclaim. Among the most
important is that found at Martinovka also near Kanev, west of pri4
the Dnieper, a large portion of which is at present in the British
Museum. It includes human and horse
f
igurines, brooches,
bracelets,
r
ings and belt-buckles and strap-ends bearing 'tamga'
signs. Signs closely related to these are found on objects in Hun
gary, Yugoslavia and Bulga
r
ia. Their geographical distribution
in a single line from the nqith-eastern comer of the Carpathians
to Croatia across Hungary suggests that they follow the route of the retreat of the Antae before the Avars.
An isolated offshoot of the Antae seems to appear in southern
Poland. Here in the
f
irst two centu
r
ies AD lived a Slavonic
people, bearers of the Przeworsk culture. At the beginning of the
3rd century this culture underwent considerable changes. Wheel
made pottery of the Pon
t
ic type appears suddenly, together with
the characteristic Sarmatian tendrilled fibulae 'with the foot turned /3
over*
, and amga' signs on the weapons.
Who were those who caused the change ? The evidence points
to Antae from Bessarabia. A number of
r
ichly furnished graves,
a feature hitherto unknown in the Przeworsk culture, were evidently burials of rulers of the country, presumably its con
querors. Some of the most notable are at Zakrzow (Sackrau); pi 18
the grave goods include objects of North Pontic o
r
igin and
Sarmatian belt-buckles, besides some Roman imports.
The kingdom of the Alanic Antae in Poland was not of long
duration; in the 5th century AD they seem to have been subdued
by the Huns from Hungary.
The Onslaught of the Huns
The Huns, fieriest and most ruthless of all the nomad peoples
who hurled themselves upon the West ('they ate, drank, slept
and held counsel on horseback' according to Ammianus Marcel
linus), had already seized the ancient homelands of the Sarmatians during the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. Those Sarmatians who still lived in the steppes of the lower Volga and the Caspian,
an eastern branch of the Alans, came strongly under their in
f
luence, if not under their direct rule, and adopted many of their
customs. In their graves we find long swords, long composite
bows of Hunnic type and Hunnic arrow-heads, larger and heavier
than the former ones. Hunnic horse-trappings and bits were also
used, and Central Asia
t
ic pottery types are the most common.
At the same time, Bosporan jewellery and gold-work continued
to be imported.
A new feature of this late Sarmatian pe
r
iod, con
f
ined almost exclusively to the Sarma
t
ians east of the Don, was cranial deformation. The custom of binding the child's head in a special /
manner in order to make it grow to a special shape has been
recorded in va

ic cultures. It became common in

seems to belong to a branch of the Eastern Alans, perhaps mixed the Huns (a skullfounaHa the same grave had typical Sarmato-Hunnic
deformation). The stones are amber, garnet and carmlian; diadems of the same type have been discovered in Alanicgraves in Hungary. (8)
Pi 16
Skull deformation, as practised by the Sarmatians, with a normal skull
(left) for comparison. The custom of arti
f
icially deforming the skull in childhood seems to have been introduced by the Huns. It was adopted by the Eastern Alans in the 4th century AD and survived amongst small groupsfor an astonishingly long time-even as late as the ijth century in the Crimea, (p)
Central Asia du
r
ing the early Christian centuries especially among
the Huns, and was then adopted by the Eastern Alans. About
70-80 per cent of skulls from eastern Sarmatian cemeteries of this period were arti
f
icially deformed.
About AD 355 the Huns advanced across the steppes of the
lower Volga and the Don. Some of the Alans retreated west
wards, some were caught up in the Hunnic tribes and dragged
into Central Europe (these groups will be traced later), but a
large portion retreated south and established themselves in the
Crimea and the Caucasus. Westward the impetus of the Huns continued with irresistible force; in 375 they broke the Ostrogothic kingdom (the bulk of the nation entered Roman Moesia,
thereby setting in train the fateful series of events that ended
with the Sack of Rome by the Goths in 410); in 405 they reached Hungary; in 451 (under At
t
ila) they crossed the Rhine; in 4J2
entered Italy. But in 453 Attila died. The conquered peoples immediately rose against them and in a single year thrust them
back again to the Dnieper.
The Alans in the Caucasus established a strong kingdom that
lasted, in some form, for 800 years. They survived the Huns, the Avars and the Turks. In the 8th century the whole country north of the Caucasus was called Alania. Their heyday was in the 12th13th century when they withstood the Tartar-Mongol invasions.
Alanic princes and princesses often intermarried with the royal house of Georgia and with aristocratic families of Byzantium.
Graves of this late period have been discovered at Zmeyskaya
in the northern foothills. Most of them were furnished with
weapons and many with horse-harness. The usual weapons were
sabres of the so-called Khazar type, common in East Europe
during the whole early mediaeval period. Their wooden sheaths
were usually decorated, often covered with a thin, richly ornamented sheet. Bows were common, but only a few spear-heads
have been found. Foot warriors had iron double-edged battle
axes. In female graves the abundance of amber is striking, and
points to connections with the Kiev country and the Bal
t
ic coast.
Cranial deformation, which had been practised up to the 8th
century, was by now abandoned. Ultimately the Sarmatians of this region merged with the indi
genous inhabitants and the names of modern Caucasian peoples
begin to appear in place of 'Alani' and 'Alania'. But these later
cultures clearly derived from them and one of them-the Ossetians-still preserves many features of the ancient Sarmatian traditions and language.
In the Ukraine some groups of Alans managed somehow to f S survive the Hunnic disaster. We find a number of Sarmatian
graves of the 4th-5 th centuries in the region of the lower Dnieper.
Some scholars believe them to have been left by Alans mixed with Huns. Characteristic of this group are the so-called 'river
graves':
f
lat graves with no mound, situated on the lowest
r
iver
terraces and overflowed by the spring tides. In them warriors
were buried, some
t
imes with their horses, richly provided with
gold ornaments, weapons and decorated horse-harness.
Other small groups of Alans are found in va
r
ious parts of
Europe and Asia throughout the succeeding centuries. In the
Crimea they are mentioned as late as the 17th century, when they were still practising cranial deformation. Another small community was living in Bessarabia in 1462, and Alanic mercenaries
served in the Byzantine army in their wars against the Seljuk
Turks. Most extraordinary of all are the 30,000 OrthodoxChristian Alans who are mentioned in 1318 by Brother Pellegrini, Bishop of Zaytun in China, as living with their families on the
Chinese coast opposite Formosa. They arc said to have been
'in the Great King's pay', but nothing more is known about
them.
Across a Continent in Forty Years: the Alans in France and Spain The fate of the Alans who retreated westward before the Huns is complicated and often pathetic. The story of one group can be /10
traced in detail. This large detachment crossed the Danube in AD 377. Together with a group of Huns, they joined the Visi
goths and Ostrogoths and ravaged the Roman territory in the
Balkans. In 378 the Alanic cavalry played a decisive role in the
famous battle of Hadrianople in which the Roman army was routed and Valens, the Emperor, slain.
Two years later, in 380, the Alans, jointly with the Ostrogoths
and the Hunnic detachment, drove northwards, entered and settled in Pannonia. Twenty years later they joined the Vandals and crossed to Noricum, the province adjoining it in the north
west, and were opposed by the Romans under Stilicho. He granted
them territories in return for pledges of service. So in 402-405
they fought in the Roman army against the Visigoths,
But in 406, jointly with the Vandals and Suaevians, they set out to invade Gaul. Under their king Respendial, they crossed
the Rhine near Mainz and defeated the opposing Franks. Part of
the Alans, under King Goar, then o
f
fered their services to the
Romans, but the bulk of them, under Respendial, and the two
allied Teutonic peoples, began a 'tour de France', ravaging and
laying waste the country and ci
t
ies in their way. Their route led
from Mainz through Treves, Rheims, Tournai, Arras, Amiens,
then Paris, Orleans, Tours, Bordeaux and Toulouse. There was no Roman army to oppose them. In 408 the Alans, after oppres

A once mightyfolk scattered among the nations
sing Gaul for two years, passed into Spain and with their allies
ravaged the whole peninsula, finally settling in Lusitania, modem
Portugal.
In 418 the Alans were routed by the Visigoths, who were
driving out barbarians' on behalf of the Emperor. Addac, king
of the Alans, was killed, and the remnants of the people
f
led to Galida where they joined the Vandals. Gunderich, king of the
Vandals, assumed the title of 'Rex Vandalorum et Alanorum1, which was retained by his successors up the the very end of the
Vandal kingdom in AD 533.
Thus finished the independent history of this branch of the
Alans, who during the 40 years since they had left their o
r
iginal
steppes had crossed a whole continent. Even now their wander
ings were not ended. Gradually merging together, the united peoples, Vandals and Alans, left Galicia for southern Spain in 422 and in 429 crossed into Africa. These Alans were not the only ones who reached France. The
group under King Gear was at different times allied with the
Visigoths and the Romans. These are probably the Alans who are recorded at Narbonne in 416 and later at Orleans. They seem not to have resisted the Huns in 451 but were subdued by the Visigoths in 452. We hear of other Alanic kings (Beogus 'Rex
Alanorum' in 464; Eochar 'ferodssimus Alanorum rex' in 440) taking part in the confused struggles of the beginning of the
Dark Ages.
Only a few archaeological remains attributable to the Sarma
tians have so far been found west of Hungary-a grave at Siebenbrunnen In Austria, a tomb at Valmery in Normandy, a fragment
of a bronze kettle near Chalon-sur-Saone, and some small gold plaques from a grave at Carthage in North Africa. Witness to
their presence in France, however, is to be found in over 50 French place-names connected with 'Sarmatians' or Plans', among them the name of the town of Alengon.
'Serboi* and 'Choroafes' in Central Europe Large numbers of the Eastern Alans, like other eastern European peoples, joined the army of the Huns. It is futile to try by archaeology to trace their route and the places in which they settled. But
some traces of them remain in the names of modern Slavonic peoples. The name 'Serb', for instance, is non-Slavonic. It occurs in Ptolemy in the 3rd century AD as the name of an East Alan people dwelling on the steppes of the lower Volga. They were presumably overrun by the Huns in the 4th century. In the Middle Ages a country called 'White Serbia' extended over Saxony and Thuringla up to the Saale, 1. e. within what was once the Hunnic Empire. We may guess that the detachment of the Hunnic army that gained power in that region consisted chiefly of East Alans,
Serboi. After the death of Attila in AD 455, they might have
gained independence and ruled the country on their own account.
The German population west of the Saale seem to have got rid
of the Alan yoke, but the Alanic Serboi seemingly maintained
their power over the Slavs east of the
r
iver. It is interesting to
note that the greatest concentration of artificially deformed skulls
at the turn of the jth and 6th centuries comes precisely in this
region.
The most plausible conclusion is that the Alanic Serboi ultimately merged in the subdued Slavonic population and that the
name 'Serbs* is at present the only trace of their sojourn there.
Some such process presumably took place in Yugoslav Serbia
where probably another branch of the Alanic Serboi was engaged.
The name 'Croat' has a similar history. The form 'Choroates' has been found among the insc
r
iptions in ancient Tanais on the
mouth of the Don. Inthe 10th century the 'Belochrobati' (White
Croats) a Slav people, occupied the upper Vistula and parts of Bohemia. They had a number of Sarmatian characteristics-the king was fed on mare's milk and they practised cranial deforma
t
ion-and the names of their chiefs were non-Slavonic. Here again, we may conjecture that an East Alan t
r
ibe bearing a name
similar to 'Croat' was entrusted by the Huns with the task of keeping the country north of the Carpathians under control.
After the downfall of the Huns, they may have ruled the country on their own account and were ultimately Slavicixed.
Scattered and Forgotten: the Fate of the Sarmatians There is something pathe
t
ic in the fate of the Sarmatians. In the
various stages of their history they were pushed over almost all the countries of western Europe. The descendants of their de
tachment of AD 175 probably still live somewhere in England.
Sarmatian history has been interwoven with that of many peoples and na
t
ions. But in spite of that they are now a nearly forgotten
people. Little remains to remind the modern world of their existence-the Ossetians, the names of a few Slavonic peoples, some
European place-names, some words of Sarmatian origin in
Slavonic languages, parts of the coats-of-arms of Polish nobility (abolished in 1920) and an increasing number of objects recovered
by archaeology. The Sarmatians were a 'barbarian' people; but
they did not distinguish themselves like the Vandals and the
Huns, whose names came to be the symbol of atrocious barbarian outrages. They contributed to the development of the
splendid Sarmato-Bosporan art, and to its 'Gothic' successor, which later gave birth to the many branches of mediaeval West
ern European art-Merovingian, Anglo-Saxon, Romanesque.
But here again their role has been passed over in silence. Perhaps the most important achievement of the Sarmatians was their part in the formation of the va
r
ious Slavonic nations. But later expansions of eastern nomads-Avars, Bulgars, Magyars,
which did not reach Western Europe, have partly obliterated the structure that they helped to create.
