Sirius
SIRIUS (Alpha Canis Majoris). From Orion, look south and to the east
to find brilliant Sirius, as if one really needs directions to find the
brightest star in the sky. Its name comes from the Greek word for
"searing" or "scorching," certainly appropriate for a star that shines
at the bright end of the "minus-first" (-1.47) magnitude. Sirius is the
luminary of the constellation Canis Major, the Greater Dog, which
represents Orion's larger hunting dog, and as such is commonly
referred to as the "Dog Star." So great is its prominence that it has
two "announcer stars" that from the mid- northern hemisphere rise
before it, Procyon and Mirzam. Famed from times long past, the first
glimpse of Sirius in dawn announced the rising of the Nile in ancient
Egypt. (It no longer does because of precession, the 26,000-year
wobble of the Earth's axis.) Sirius is also part of a large asterism, the
Winter Triangle, the other two stars of which are Betelgeuse in Orion
and Procyon in the smaller dog, Canis Minor. Because of its
brilliance, Sirius is the champion of all twinklers, the effect caused by
variable refraction in the Earth's atmosphere. The star, a white class
A (A1) hydrogen-fusing dwarf with a temperature of 9880 Kelvin, is
bright in part because it is indeed rather luminous, 26 times more so
than the Sun, but mostly because it is nearby, a mere 8.6 light years
away, just double that of the closest star to the Earth (Alpha
Centauri) and the fifth closest star system. Sirius is "metal rich," its
iron content perhaps double that of the Sun, most likely from some
sort of elemental diffusion. With a radius of 1.75 solar (in agreement
with the measured angular diameter) and a minimum equatorial
rotation speed of 16 kilometers per second, Sirius rotates in under
5.5 days. The star's greatest claim to fame may be its dim eighth
magnitude (8.44) companion, Sirius B, which is visually nearly 10,000
times fainter than the bright star, Sirius A. Sirius B, however, is



actually the hotter of the two, a blue-white 24,800 Kelvin. Though
typically separated from each other by a few seconds of arc, Sirius B
is terribly difficult to see in the glare of Sirius A. The only way the
companion star can be both hot and dim is to be small, only 0.92 the
size of Earth, the total luminosity (including its ultraviolet light) just
2.4 percent that of the Sun. The two orbit each other with a 50.1 year
period at an average distance of 19.8 Astronomical Units, about
Uranus's distance from the Sun, a large orbital eccentricity carrying
them from 31.5 AU apart to 8.1 AU and back again. They were
closest in 1994 and will be again in 2044, while they will be farthest
apart in 2019. From the orbit (and spectroscopic data), we find that
Sirius A and B have respective masses of 2.12 and 1.03 times that of
the Sun. Sirius B is the chief member of a trio of classic white dwarfs,
the others Procyon B and 40 Eridani B. Its high mass and tiny radius
lead to an amazing average density of 1.7 metric tons per cubic
centimeter, roughly a sugar cube. White dwarfs are the end products
of ordinary stars like the Sun, tiny remnants that were once nuclear
fusing cores that have run out of fuel. Most are balls of carbon and
oxygen whose fates are merely to cool forever. To have evolved first,
Sirius B must once have been more massive and luminous than Sirius
A. That its mass is now lower is proof that stars lose considerable
mass as they die. Given the mass of the white dwarf and the 250
million year age of the system, Sirius B may once have been a hot
class B3-B5 star that could have contained as much as 5 to 7 solar
masses, the star perhaps losing over 80 percent of itself back into
interstellar space through earlier winds. (Thanks to Steve Ash for
prompting a rewrite.)
