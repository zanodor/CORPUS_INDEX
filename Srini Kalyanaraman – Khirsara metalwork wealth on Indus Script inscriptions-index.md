[quote]And at length rose the great elephant, Airavata, of huge body and with two pair of white tusks. And him took Indra the wielder of the thunderbolt. But with the churning still going on, the poison Kalakuta appeared at last. Engulfing the Earth it suddenly blazed up like a fire attended with fumes. And by the scent of the fearful Kalakuta, the three worlds were stupefied. And then Siva, being solicited by Brahman, swallowed that poison for the safety of the creation. The divine Maheswara held it in his throat, and it is said that from that time he is called Nilakantha (blue-throated). Seeing all these wondrous things, the Asuras were filled with despair, and got themselves prepared for entering into hostilities with the gods for the possession of Lakshmi and Amrita. Thereupon Narayana called his bewitching Maya (illusive power) to his aid, and assuming the form of an enticing female, coquetted with the Danavas. The Danavas and the Daityas charmed with her exquisite beauty and grace lost their reason and unanimously placed the Amrita in the hands of that fair damsel. [unquote] So ends the eighteenth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva. https://www.sacredtexts.com/hin/m01/m01019.htm Kisari Mohan Ganguli’s Englilsh translation.

Khirsara is an archaeological site of Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization on the Gujarat coast of the Indian Ocean. The site is a node in the maritime TransAsiatic exchanges mediated by seafaring Meluhha merchants and artisans. The name of the village is a significant reminder of life-activities of the seafaring Meluhhan merchants and artisans. The name, khirsara (Meluhha of Indian sprachbund) is a shortened form of the gloss: kṣīrásāgara क्षीरसागर (Samskrtam)
Khirsara (Meluhha), kṣīrásāgara –क्षीरसागर (Samskrtam)

“Seals found in this site belong from the early stage to the late stage of the mature Harappan phase. There are rectangular seals depicting the unicorn and the bison and the Harappan characters. There are rectangular bar-type seals with the Harappan script alone and circular seals, all of which show that Khirsara is a mature Harappan site,” said Jitendra Nath, the excavator of the ongoing digs in Khirsara which commenced in 2009. Khirsara is a Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization site situated about 85 km from Bhuj town in Gujarat’s Kutch district. "There are a variety of beads made of shell and steatite and of semi-precious stones such as lapis lazuli, agate, carnelian, chert, chalcedony and jasper. About 25,000 steatite beads were found in one trench alone. Shell bangles, shell inlays, copper bangles and rings were also found in plenty. Among copper implements were chisels, knives, needles, points, fish hooks, arrow-heads and weights. There were also bone tools, bone points and beads made out of bones...The ASI team found 11 seals, including circular seals. Some of them are carved with unicorn and bison images, and have the Harappan script engraved on them. While the unicorn seal is made of soapstone, the bison seal is made out of steatite. A rare discovery was that of two bar seals, both engraved with the Harappan script only and remarkably intact. “The kind of antiquities we are getting from this site indicates that Khirsara was a major industrial hub in western Kutch. It was located on a trade route from other parts of Gujarat to Sind in Pakistan, which is about 100 km away. Of course, the Harappans who lived here were basically traders, manufacturing industrial goods for export to distant lands and to other Harappan sites in the vicinity and farther away.” Khirsara is unique among Indus Valley settlements in having a general fortification wall around the settlement and also separate fortification walls around every complex inside the settlement. The citadel complex, the warehouse, the factory-cum-residential complex, and even the potters’ kiln have their own protective walls." http://www.frontline.in/arts-and-culture/heritage/discoveringkhirsaras-harappan-glory/article4794614.ece
