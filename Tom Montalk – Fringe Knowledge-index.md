Foreword
The last half of my life has been spent in the active pursuit of truth. In the following pages I sketch the broadest map of what I have learned in the fewest words possible. You will not find proof between the covers of this book, rather ideas and principles that give you understanding and perspective on proof existing all around and within you. The more you investigate these ideas for yourself, the more intelligently you can judge the accuracy of my map.
If ignorance is bliss, why seek truth? Because permanent freedom is far more valuable than temporary comfort. Truth frees you from the manipulation, miscalculation, and disillusionment that ignorance inevitably brings. You want to know, and no amount of external gratification can satisfy that inner vacuum yearning to be filled with meaning, purpose, and understanding.
Society once suffered from ignorant superstition; today it suffers from ignorant skepticism. When people are confronted with a challenging view, most see only that it differs from their own, and so they dismiss higher truths beyond their recognition as quickly as they would those obvious delusions beneath their threshold of gullibility. Higher knowledge is therefore fringe knowledge because those who pursue it have been alienated to the fringes of society. These fringe truth seekers follow their hearts and open their minds, having placed more importance on the liberation of their souls than the conventions of society.
Treat this book as a working hypothesis, an educated guess to be tested by your own experiences, research, and insights. Take what makes sense and leave the rest for another time.






1
The Basics
We start with the simple and obvious. You see through your eyes, hear through your ears, feel through your body, and think through your brain. But you are not your eyes, ears, body, or brain—these are just things you experience the world with. So then, what are you? Remember that anything that can be taken away from you cannot be you. Like your clothes or hair—without them you would be bald and naked, but you would still be you.
Now take away your body and brain. Is there anything left? Did you know that people have come back from being dead for a few minutes, remembering all they did while they were gone? Yes, sometimes they recall floating above their own lifeless bodies, seeing and hearing the doctors and nurses working on them, maybe floating away and exploring what’s around before being brought back to life.* Even without their bodies and brains, they were still alive somehow, aware and experiencing. This shows that they are not their bodies, and neither are you.
Think of your body as a character inside a video game. To interact with the game world you need to play a game character. But you are not the character; you are merely controlling it from out

side the game. Same thing with your body. To interact with the physical world, you need a physical body. Through the body, your mind existing outside this world can play this game called life. A first-person game where you look through the eyes of a character makes it seem like you are inside its head, but really you are sitting in front of the computer. Likewise, although you sense yourself inside your physical head, you are actually located far beyond it in another dimension.
When your body dies, it is just like dying inside a game. Nothing happens to the real you since, if you remember, you are not your body. The real you, which is essentially your mind or spirit, gets to hang around for a little while, maybe quit the game for now, maybe start a new game as a new character. But in this life, you only get one turn, so it is important to stay alive as long as needed, to keep your health and energy at a good level while having fun with the game.
The real you was born into this body, into this world, and has forgotten it is just a game character. It does not remember where it came from, where it’s going, why it’s playing the game, and what the point of this game is. It has gotten all wrapped up in the daily experiences of life. But now you are learning what you really are: a spirit that cannot be harmed or killed even if the body is harmed or killed. And like a game, some of the things that happen are scripted, meant to happen from the very beginning.
Etheric and Astral Bodies
Unlike the body, your mind is not at all physical. You cannot touch or weigh your mind. For this nonphysical mind to work through a physical body, there needs to be a couple in-between layers connecting them. These layers are known as the etheric and astral body. They are shaped like your body but just barely physical enough to influence the body while also being influenced by the



The Basics 13
mind. Normally you cannot see the etheric and astral bodies, but with special vision or special instruments you can detect them.
The etheric body looks like a ghostly glowing copy of your physical body.* It is a pattern of energy that guides your biological cells into growing and behaving in an organized way, keeping you alive and healthy. Think of the etheric body like the field of a magnet pulling on a bunch of tiny metal pieces, pointing them into an orderly pattern. It does the same thing to the cells in your physical body. Without the etheric, your physical body would eventually fall apart. People who lose their limbs in accidents often continue to feel something there even though the physical limb is gone†—they are feeling the etheric part that stayed intact. Normally the etheric overlaps your physical body, but during sleep it may expand and hover above it a little. The energy that the etheric body is made of is lifeforce energy. Fresh fruits and vegetables have lots of it because they are alive, and everyone knows that fresh is healthier for you than cooked, though not everyone knows it’s because cooking also removes the etheric lifeforce energy in food.
Even less physical than the etheric, but also more vibrant and sophisticated is the astral body. It does to the etheric body what the etheric does to the physical. Basically it influences the shape and behavior of the etheric. What makes the astral body different is that instead of dealing with lifeforce energy, the astral deals with emotional and creative energy. Rather than moving the cells of your body, it moves your feelings. The types of feelings you regularly have determine the shape and color of your astral body. But because the astral is so close to the mind, the way it looks is often more symbolic than anything.‡ For instance, an angry or wicked

14 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
person will have an astral body that looks crooked and scary, even though the physical body looks normal.
So to summarize, the mind influences the astral, the astral influences the etheric, and the etheric influences the body. In this way the mind can control the body. Now if you think negative thoughts all the time, it will affect your astral body and make it full of negative emotions, which then influence the etheric by making it darker and weaker, which then over time causes illness in the physical body. Therefore to stay healthy, it is important to not dwell all the time on stress, useless negative thoughts, and bad feelings.
Also, children fall ill more easily than adults. This is partly because their physical immune system has not yet been trained to fight disease, and partly because their etheric body is softer and weaker. If you eat more living foods like fruits and vegetables, focus on the happy things in life that fill you with gratitude, and stop worrying about what you cannot change, you can greatly reduce how often you get sick regardless of your age.

Consciousness
The Nature of Dreams
One third of our day is spent sleeping. For a third of our lives, we are asleep. Many people ignore what happens when they sleep and only care about waking up feeling rested. But for someone who is sixty years old, that means twenty years of life that went ignored. You can make use of that wasted time by paying attention to your dreams, which are important for several reasons.
The physical body needs sleep to quietly fix, grow, and recharge itself. Without sleep, the body runs out of the chemicals needed to stay active. Through dreams, the brain sorts and files away those thoughts and images picked up throughout the day before that did not get properly placed into its memory, like defragmenting the hard drive of a computer to make it run better.
For the astral and etheric bodies, sleep replenishes their energy as well. When the etheric body is low on energy, you may feel weak and have trouble paying attention.* When the astral body is low on energy, you may feel blah and get easily distracted, not feeling like doing anything creative.† To recharge, the etheric and

16 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
astral bodies may expand in size during sleep and even shift out of the physical body in order to soak up the energies much like a plant unfurls its leaves to soak up the sun.
But for the mind, sleep does something amazing. Through dreams, the mind tunes into important messages that otherwise cannot get through while a person is awake. There are three main ways dreams are useful for the mind.
First, on the most basic level, dreams can tell you about problems concerning what you have been doing, thinking, or feeling recently. Like if you have been doing something harmful without knowing it, letting yourself feel angry and depressed for too long, thinking about starting a new project that will only be a waste of time—messages like these can be shown to you in dreams.
Second, dreams can tell you the future. Important experiences you might go through within a couple days or weeks may show up first in your dreams. What kind of experiences? Well, positive ones like accomplishments or unexpected surprises, or negative ones that might make you stressed, sad, or angry. If you learn about the future through your dreams, you can actually be prepared to deal with the bad stuff and sometimes even keep it from happening in the first place. In this way, dreams can work like radar to show you what is coming up.*
And third, dreams can be educational video games if you learn how to realize inside them that you are dreaming. These are called lucid dreams, where “lucid” means awake or aware. In a lucid dream, you know you are dreaming and can therefore do anything you want. You can fly around exploring the dreamscape, walk through walls or levitate and morph objects into other ones, talk to strange dream characters or listen to dream music—anything, all

Consciousness 17
being created by some part of your own mind. Lucid dreams can also let you speak with dead relatives or other dimensional beings that pop into your dream if you call them.
The first step to using your dreams is to remember them. To do this, make sure you get enough sleep. When waking up, don’t think right away of what you must do that day, but instead try to remember what you just dreamt. Most useful of all is to keep a pen and small notebook next to your bed and whenever you wake up, jot down anything you remember. Not only does this help you recall the dream later on, but it also tells your mind that remembering them is important. Automatically over the next days or weeks you will find that your dreams do become easier to remember.
The second step is to interpret their meaning. This is tricky because dreams are mostly symbolic. This means the message they contain is wrapped in a riddle made of pictures, words, and themes that are not meant to be taken literally. For instance, dreaming that a bear attacks you does not mean you will actually be attacked by a bear, but it might mean you will get some angry words from a mean person. Or dreaming that you are caught in a tornado might mean you will be swept up in an emotionally tense experience soon. By writing down your dreams, you can compare them to what’s actually happening in your life, or anything important that happens to you within several days, and over time you will learn to interpret them more accurately. To get started, you can use a dream dictionary that gives you suggestions on what a symbol often tends to mean.*
Also know that negative astral beings, which are lifeforms without physical bodies that feed on your emotional energy of fear or anger, sometimes come around when you sleep to jack into your

dreams, turning them into nightmares. They tend to pick on children the most because young people have weaker etheric bodies and are easier to frighten. You can identify these dreams by how much they make you feel angry or scared, and how nonsensical they are. If you often have nightmares, before going to sleep try to remember something happy, then visualize that your room and body is lit up with a bright golden light, then pray or intend that you be protected while you sleep in peace. This helps keep negative astral critters away. Or if you learn to lucid dream, you can face a monster in a nightmare, tell it you’re not afraid, and ask it what it wants, which will transform the monster into something powerless.
Learning to lucid dream takes practice. There are different techniques, and a popular one is to pick something that you occasionally see or do in your dreams that you also see or do while awake, like a type of animal, a color, a person, place, or action. Then whenever you see or do this while awake, look around and ask yourself if you are dreaming. Do a test like flicking a light switch, remembering what you did for the past hour, looking at a clock or some printed words, or counting your fingers—if you’re in a dream, there will be something wrong with these. If you keep this up for at least a week, then it will become a habit that you will naturally do even in dreams, which will make you realize you are dreaming. Another method involves watching those faint light patterns behind your eyelids as you go to sleep. As you stay relaxed but mentally awake, these will turn into vivid images and then a lucid dream.*
Dreams can also teach you lessons about yourself and the world. These tend to play like vivid documentaries that make concise and meaningful points concerning the bigger picture of “all this.”

Consciousness 19
Generally, dreams give you a “heads up” on things that you might otherwise not expect. By fixing existing problems indicated by a dream, or preparing to handle ones coming up, you can make your life go more smoothly. Instead of stumbling around blind, you get clued into what’s going on behind the scenes. But you will have to separate the meaningful dreams from the nonsense ones that come from your brain sorting its memory pieces or an astral critter trying to feed. Only by remembering dreams and trying your best to figure them out will you learn over time how to sift out the nonsense.
Incarnation and Reincarnation
If your mind can exist without the body, then where was the mind before you were born? And what happens to the mind after the body dies? See, life is like a dream where being born is like falling asleep and dying like waking up again. In between, your mind thinks, feels, and lives through a temporary character just as you might in a dream. Being born is similar to how an actor takes on a temporary role for a movie. The same actor plays different roles in different movies, and likewise the mind is born into different bodies in different lifetimes.
When a person dies, his spirit eventually returns to the nonphysical dimension it came from.* There the spirit gets to ponder the life just lived and after making some goals for what to do next time, find the right body at the right time and be born again. This is called reincarnation. It’s like going to an arcade; you walk around, find the right machine, play for a bit, then when game is over you look for a different game to play.
But even while playing, you are still there outside the game, it’s just a part of your mind that is for the moment absorbed in con

trolling the game character. Likewise, even though we are here in this physical dimension, there is a greater part of ourselves still up in that higher dimension dipping only a small part of itself into your body. That small part is what you think and feel with right now. Let’s call this greater part the higher self and the smaller part the lower self. The higher self is who you are when fully awake outside this dream called life. The lower self is who you are within the dream. So it would be more correct to say that reincarnation is simply the higher self extending parts of itself into different bodies at different times through birth, and pulling those parts back through death. We are like finger puppets—the puppet is who we are to others in this life, the finger in the puppet is our lower self, and the hand is our higher self.
Why do people choose to be born into this world? There are as many answers as there are people. Some people come here to do something, to experience something, to learn things they cannot outside this world. It is the same reason people play games or watch movies—they get to experience things they couldn’t otherwise.
Being alive on earth in a physical body can be difficult. Life is like an obstacle course, weight training program, or crash course in a tough subject. Besides the fun and joy in being alive, there is also anger, fear, and suffering. But the negative stuff is what makes the game challenging and unique. Life is bodybuilding for the soul, and the challenges we face in life are the weights that build up our spiritual muscles if we have the strength to handle them.
Another reason someone might come here is to help others wake up. Think of a college student who goes back to high school to help other students learn things he has already mastered. The problem is that being born wipes your memories of where you came from and who you truly are, as though the college student joins high school having forgotten he already graduated. The sub

jects might seem strangely familiar and easy to him, and in this way he can still help others. But should he get sucked up into the distractions that come with being a high school student, he might forget even what he learned in college, maybe even flunk out.
That is the risk these helper souls face when incarnating on earth. They might get so distracted in life that they never discover the higher knowledge within them, failing to do what they came here to do, which is use that knowledge to help others. Maybe you are a helper soul. If you enjoy figuring things out, pondering the mysteries of the universe, and feel happy when other people find ways to improve their lives and themselves, then most likely you are a helper soul. If so, it is very important that you devote some time thinking, reading, learning about higher truths in order to familiarize yourself with who you really are and what you really know.
At the core, you already know these truths but have forgotten them. Remembering is difficult because compared to your higher self the lower self is incredibly asleep and distracted, so recovering what you know deep inside is similar to learning it for the first time. The difference is that if some truth is already within you, learning it again will come more quickly and with an exciting sense of recognition. You will feel something special when you finally understand what you already know deep down. It carries the ring of truth. Instead of going “...okay, uhuh...” as with learning something mundane, you might instead go “Huh! That really makes sense! Amazing!” or “Ohhhh! Now I get it!” That is how you can recognize truth—not only will it make sense, but it will feel right. When both the head and heart agree with an idea, pay attention.

Waking Up
My goal is to give you a general overview of what I have learned concerning truth and provide some pointers on how you can discover the same or better for yourself. Towards this end, let me share with you the three most powerful techniques for getting yourself up to speed. They are: gathering, contemplating, and meditating.
Gathering
Gathering means to read, watch, and listen to sources of information having to do with the subjects covered in this book and elsewhere. It also means collecting facts from your own experiences and what you have noticed about the world. So read books, websites, magazines dealing with this stuff, listen to audio courses and radio shows, watch movies and documentaries, have discussions with other helper souls interested in truth. You are gathering ideas from which to extract what might be truth.
Contemplation
Contemplating is where the magic happens. Food is useless unless you digest it, and the same with ideas that are not contemplated. To contemplate means to ponder, put the puzzle pieces together, come up with questions and possible answers, turn ideas over in



24 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
your mind and see what fits, to sit and think. It is journeying into your mind on a thought safari, hunting for new insights. The easiest way to do this is with pen and sketchbook. Start by jotting down what’s on your mind, the main points of what you have gathered, some question or problem that you are still wondering about. Then brainstorm some ideas, think about the possibilities and work things out. You will discover that as you do this, key insights will pop into your head. When they first appear, they are in the form of thought-balls, which are tangled packets of ideas that you can feel but maybe not know how to express in words right away. Sketch these thought-balls out in phrases and pictures before you forget them, then you can more easily turn these into clearly written explanations.
What’s really happening when you contemplate is that you are opening yourself up to messages from the deeper levels of your mind, sometimes even the higher self. It is your job to unravel these thought-balls into understandable explanations and check that they make sense and feel right.
Meditation
Meditating means quieting and focusing your mind so that you are aware of yourself in the present moment. Normally you might have random thoughts, conversations, memories, and songs going through your head all day like some crazy circus between your ears. That is not good because your mind never gets a break from the chaos. And like trying to drive with people jumping around and yelling in their seats, you’re distracted and not all there.
Meditation is where you take a few minutes to still your mind. Done daily it helps you be more aware, improves your energy and calmness, heightens your ability to concentrate, and makes you a clearer thinker.



Waking Up 25
Here is how to meditate: find a quiet spot and relax, then close your eyes and focus your attention on one thing only. When your mind wanders, bring it back to that one thing. Keep this up for between five and thirty minutes. If you fall asleep, choose a less comfortable position, like sitting with your back straight.
What to focus on? Here are some suggestions:
1) Starting with your toes, pay careful attention to what each small part of your body feels like, work your way to the top of your head and repeat. 2) Mentally feel the presence of the room around you, then your house, neighborhood, planet, and outer space; feel yourself surrounded by the whole universe. 3) Silently observe your thoughts as though you were watching the mind of another. 4) Keep your mind centered on the “here” and “now” with full alertness and readiness. 5) Vividly visualize a blooming plant and feel its aliveness. 6) Focus on a positive emotions like peace, goodwill, joy, love, or compassion and steadily maintain that feeling.
It is important to stay sharply aware while meditating to avoid falling into mindless daydreams, hypnotic trances, or unconscious sleep. The goal is to take charge of your mind and achieve elevated awareness and heightened focus. In the long run, meditation helps to strengthen the connection between lower and higher self. It may also activate your psychic powers, but only when you least expect it and are ready to use those powers responsibly.

Game Called Life
Life is also like a role-playing computer game you (as the higher self) help design and then experience. The general plot of the game is decided beforehand, but how it actually turns out depends on how well you play and the choices you make. What is the point of this game? It is to experience and better understand yourself, others, and reality. Anything you go through in life that affects you for better or for worse is there to serve that purpose. These experiences are there to help you become smarter and wiser. They contain learning lessons and are arranged for you by the game designer; the higher self who designed and can still make changes to the game as you play it.
To give you a better idea of what kind of lessons I’m talking about, here are some ideas: you learn what you are really capable of doing by overcoming your fears; you learn the wisdom of how to handle complex situations for the best of everyone involved; you learn how others feel when you hurt them through selfish choices; you learn how to distinguish what is good and true from dark and false; you learn how following the dark parts of you brings pain and misfortune but following what is good in you brings peace and happiness; you learn what really has meaning and value and what are illusions that do not make your soul happy; you learn about what love really means; and you learn how reality works and how



28 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
there are so many limitations you can break through if you understand them and give it your best shot.
You, the lower self, do not decide what lessons you need, but you do decide the timing and style of experience necessary for you to learn a particular lesson. For instance, if you have an open mind and love to learn, the experience might be an easy and exciting one because that is all you need to get the point. But if you are stubborn and stuck in your thinking, the experience might be harsher so that the lesson gets through to you. If an experience does not deliver its message to you successfully, it will repeat under a similar but different circumstance so that you get another chance. But the more you ignore it, the more painful the next repetitive experience becomes. So the key to having an easier and more exciting life is to pay attention to what your experiences can teach you, and then use what you learn to make better choices in the future. These lessons simply make you understand what you did not see before, thereby changing your approach to life for the better. But if the same bad episode keeps happening then there is something you’re not getting, or if you get it, something you’re not putting into practice. It’s not always easy figuring out what that might be, but ask your higher self for understanding and maybe the answer will come to you within a few days as a realization, or ask someone wiser than you for some suggestions.
Freewill and Destiny
Regarding freewill and destiny, both of these are real and exist together. Freewill is your ability to choose and act on your choices. Destiny is the blueprint that determines the course of your life. Some people wonder how freewill can exist if destiny means your choices are already pre-decided. The answer is that destiny only decides what you must learn and why, not how you will learn or when. The latter is up to you depending on your attitude and how stubborn or perceptive you are to these lessons. The destiny of an acorn is to become an oak tree, but how that tree will actually turn



Game Called Life 29
out is not yet decided. Your destiny is to become all that you truly are, but how you will get there is up to you.
When we live within our destiny, meaning when we use both our minds and hearts to make smart choices and learn early and clearly from our experiences, then things flow smoothly and joyfully. But people tend to be stubborn and not all that perceptive, so they rarely accomplish all they came here to do and learn because their life ends before they get a chance to correct their mistakes. This is one reason they incarnate: to finish what they started. If they only had the chance to consider the ideas you are reading now, they might have spared themselves some suffering by not having to repeat so many lessons.
The only true mistakes in life are those that go directly against your destiny, such as when you ambitiously go for something that you know deep down is the wrong thing to do. But even if you follow your destiny, you still have so many choices available on how to get there. Destiny is your destination; true mistakes come from choosing the wrong destination; freewill means choosing the right destination but being free to meander among the various routes.

Mind over Matter
External Effects of Thoughts and Feelings
It may seem incredible, but everyday your thoughts and feelings shape what happens to you. The world you experience reflects back what is going on inside your own head and heart.
People who are always complaining attract more things to complain about. People who are always stressed attract stressful situations. People who are always angry attract angering experiences. If you start your day with a bad attitude, you might just end up having a bad day. But if you start the day with a good attitude, more often than not you will have a good day. People who have a positive mindset—maybe because they see the good in others, appreciate the beauty around them, have hope for the future, and try to make the best out of all situations—will attract more experiences to feel good about.
You might wonder why thoughts and feelings inside us influence what happens outside us. Short answer is that reality is one big dream we are all sharing, a dream created by all of our minds together. In your nightly dreams, it is your mind creating everything you experience, and what affects your mind affects the dream. Likewise, the thoughts and feelings you have while awake influence the part of reality that your mind is continuously creating.

The world revolves around you, but it also revolves around every other living being.
Think of yourself as a radio and your thoughts and feelings as the tuning mechanism. Frequency is how fast something vibrates, and the energy coming out of a radio tower is vibrating at a certain rate. Each radio station broadcasts on its own frequency. As you change the dial, the radio becomes sensitive to a different frequency and therefore tunes into a different station. Your mind, etheric, and astral bodies tune you into different “stations” of experience. When you are wallowing in negative thoughts and feelings, you are sensitive to low frequencies and tune into a station “playing” that kind of experience. But when you shift your frequency to something more positive and aware, the station changes toward experiences that are also more positive.
When you become aware of some possibility, you shine upon it the spotlight of your awareness. This singles it out, makes it freeze in its tracks, and puts it in your hands to deal with. Notice how trouble happens when you least expect it, and when you learn to expect it next time it fails to happen again. This shows that anticipating negative possibilities prevents them from manifesting, and that being unaware allows them to happen more easily. The same goes for positive possibilities—maybe you are certain you aced a test only to find out you barely passed; or maybe you win a prize from a contest only when you have forgotten all about it or never thought you might win. Anticipating something decreases its chances of manifesting. So learn to become aware of possible problems in order to freeze them, while avoiding anticipating the positive things.
Ahead of you in time is a constantly shifting spread of probable futures. These are possible experiences yet to occur. Most probable futures are not set in stone because your thoughts, feelings, and choices continually affect their likelihood; a change you make now



Mind Over Matter 33
can change which of these is most likely to happen next. As long as the future stays open like this, you can use thoughts and feelings to shape them. But as soon as a future becomes absolutely certain, then you must deal with it through preparation and action. So there are two ways of handling experiences: by shaping them before they are certain, and dealing with them directly once they become unavoidable.*
For example, maybe you set out for a bike ride while being in a bad mood and completely forget about the possibility that you might get a flat tire...not only does the negative emotion attract the probable future where you get a flat, but your lack of awareness doesn’t freeze it from happening either. Popping your tires is very likely then. But if you change your attitude towards being more positive and also take a patch kit and air pump with you, then that really cuts down the chances of getting a flat in the first place. In this case, the future is open and through thoughts and feelings you shift from a negative probable future to a positive one.
Now consider what happens when your bicycle tire has a small puncture before you even take off. It is then absolutely certain that by the time you decide to come back it will have gone flat. No amount of awareness or attitude improvement beforehand will prevent the air from leaking. The future of having to use your patch kit and air pump becomes locked into place, and as long as you took these with you, you will have dealt with a certain future through prevention and action. On the plus side, having a positive attitude might not prevent a certain future like this, but it can attract unexpected help. Maybe you forget to take a patch kit anyway, but because you are attracting positive experiences, someone will just happen to be nearby to help.

It is possible that by becoming aware of a danger you become so fearfully obsessed with it that your negative attitude actually draws it in. There are two solutions to this problem. The first is purposely not thinking about dangers: out of sight, out of mind; ignorance is bliss; and so on. And yes, that avoids attracting the danger, however it does not block it, so sooner or later it will come up and your lack of awareness and preparation will leave you hurting. The second solution is to stop being scared, depressed, obsessed, or paranoid about the things you know or suspect. Easier said than done, but it’s something to shoot for. If you can be aware of a danger, know how to handle it, and yet not uncontrollably fear it, then you have all the protection you need without the negativity that draws it towards you.
Awareness, thoughts, and anticipation not only select or filter probable futures, but help you deal with them should they happen anyway. So once again, be aware of possible problems and know how to counter them without losing your positive attitude. Awareness is like a sword—just flashing one at an attacker can scare him off and win the fight before it even happens, but should the attack proceed anyway then the sword helps you survive. Awareness is the greatest protection you can have; always seek to expand your understanding and realization. The two risks to avoid are allowing something negative by being ignorant, and drawing it in by being aware but emotionally obsessed.
Intending and Requesting
Here is a neat trick to attract what your heart desires. First get yourself into a good mood by thinking about happy memories, people and conditions you are thankful for, something beautiful around you, or reflect on how you are an eternal spirit playing this exciting game called life. Then once you are beaming, intensely imagine in your mind what you would like to have or experience, and state “I sincerely intend that this or something better manifests, for the highest good of all.” Lastly, feel confident and



Mind Over Matter 35
grateful that your request was heard, then put it out of your mind. As soon as conditions allow, you will unexpectedly receive what you asked for. It might take a few days or weeks for your probable futures to shuffle around enough to allow this to manifest.
This works because the energy you increase through positive feelings attracts the particular future you select through vivid thinking. It then starts moving towards you. By putting it out of your mind afterwards, you allow it to continue moving without freezing into place as might happen if you keep impatiently anticipating or doubting when and how it might manifest. Don’t worry about how it can happen, just know that it can happen one way or another.*
But beware that the more ridiculous, selfish, controlling, or harmful your request, the less likely it will ever manifest. Or if it does manifest, it might bring you more suffering and regret than you realize. So avoid intending for millions of dollars to fall out of thin air, that a certain person fall in love with you against their current wishes, or that harm comes to others you dislike. But you can still intend that you never run out of money, that you find someone who is perfectly compatible with you and loves you back, that a person you dislike never bothers you again. There is an important difference between these, mainly that the right way is to intend that which respects people’s freewill. Intend from the heart and you can’t go wrong.

Synchronicities, Signs, and Numbers
Synchronicities are coincidences so strange and meaningful that you can’t help but think “wow, that was weird!” when they happen. Far from being random, synchronicities are made for you to notice. They communicate a message much like dream symbols do. After all, waking reality is just a big collective dream of which a tiny slice belongs to you—and that slice is what your synchronicities come through. They can be sent by the higher self or any other being outside our physical reality. Sometimes even your own thoughts and feelings pull them in.
What synchronicities (“synchs”) mean depends on when and how they happen. They may surround times in your life when you gain new and profound insights. Or they tend to pop up hours or days before an emotionally tense personal situation. What both of these have in common is that they are responses to your changing deeply and suddenly. When you light up with a new realization, it changes you forever, same when you learn the lessons of a painful or stressful experience. This rapid change in your soul creates a shockwave that shakes reality around you, both into the future and into the past, and just as shaking an apple tree causes apples to fall down, shaking reality causes synchronicities to fall into place.



38 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
These “feedback synchs” are the most common kinds of synchs, ones that give you feedback on what you’re doing or what’s ahead.
Other synchronicities do more than give you a sign, they actually provide you with interesting opportunities and suggestions. What makes them synchronistic is that they come with odd timing, maybe through different sources at once. For instance, you might think in the morning how you need a job for the summer, and that same day a friend calls unexpectedly and mentions a great place looking to hire. Or you might come across a website about a certain subject you have never learned before, then overhear a conversation about it the next day. These “opportunity synchs” make you pause and wonder whether something higher is nudging you.
Most synchronicities are sent by positive forces to help you out. They tend to be subtle and elegant, just strong enough to catch your attention and interest. Rather than pushing you into making a certain choice, they merely respond to what you have already chosen or needed; they come in the nick of time, much to your relief, and your intuition and logic agree the opportunity looks good.
But not all synchronicities are positive; some are artificially created by negative forces to lure you into something dangerous. “Artificial synchs” are overly bizarre to pressure you into doing something against your better judgment. The warning sign is when you think, “I’m not too sure about this, but the whole thing is so weird I guess it’s meant to be...”—no, if your intuition and logic suggest something is off, then don’t take the bait regardless of how clearly the opportunity seems arranged. When in doubt, wait it out.
Then there are “negative synchs,” which rather than trying to persuade you simply work to push your buttons and screw things up. They are accidents, disruptions, injuries, misunderstandings, and other problems that happen against all odds and therefore ap

pear to be orchestrated. Negative synchs can’t always be blamed on negative forces because other factors like negative attitude, karma, and stumbling down a wrong path in life can attract these as well. By handling them with grace and learning how to prevent them the next time, you can cut down on how often they happen.
To summarize, synchronicities are meaningful coincidences or improbable events that arise with a purpose. Depending on the type, they may give you feedback on some change you are undergoing, whether change for better or worse; they can bring your attention to some opportunity that might be worth following; they can manipulate you towards a bad choice or attack your emotional and mental balance. With these you are seeing the hyper dimensional nature of reality in action, both in the way reality responds to your consciousness and in the tug of war between positive and negative forces. The more you observe this hidden side of reality in action, the better you understand why some things happen the way they do. Most of all, you can make better-informed decisions.
Karma
What you give, is given back. What you take, is taken back. That is the law of karma. Karma is a type of spiritual debt or credit we accumulate that attracts payback experiences, ones that compensate for the choices you made in the past. If you have made choices to help others in need, that brings you positive karma and perhaps in the future you will be helped in return. If you have chosen to hurt others who were innocent, that gives you negative karma and sooner or later you may experience that pain for yourself.
The law of karma is easy to misunderstand or misapply, and some people reject it because they perceive it wrongly. For instance, the point of negative karma is to help you understand what you ignored when you made your negative choice. The experience is merely there to help you learn or remember that lesson in the deepest way possible. Those who misunderstand karma might con



40 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
clude that if you are faced with a painful experience (like being abused) that you should let it happen since you obviously deserved it by having previously caused the same pain upon another. On the contrary, even if the situation is a form of paying back negative karma, since it is the lesson that counts, once you understand that abuse is wrong (the core lesson) you can and must stand up for yourself and end the abusive experience.
Karma begins and ends with choice. In the case of negative karma, it begins with the choice to violate oneself or another and ends with the choice to undo and prevent further damage by understanding the problem that caused it. If there is no choice, there is no karma. Therefore if someone is forced against his will to harm another, he acquires little or no karma other than what regrets he may have for getting into that situation. One example are soldiers at war—if they kill an enemy soldier in a life or death situation, they have killed a human being and that seems wrong, but this causes less karma than if they were back home and killed their neighbor who posed no threat. And yet, if they signed up voluntarily for the military, this does bring a little karma that might teach them next time (perhaps in another life) to make a wiser decision. Another example would be executioners at death row prisons—they are the ones who kill convicts, sometimes innocent men falsely accused, but the choice to execute was that of the judicial system and not them in particular, therefore they don’t receive as much negative karma beyond what follows from their choice to even get that job.
Karma accumulated in one life may carry over into the next life. Some of the painful experiences we undergo may originate with the choices we made in a previous life. This irritates people who think it’s unfair that we should be affected by choices we don’t even remember, that it would be like going to jail for unknown crimes.



Reality Feedback 41
On the one hand, it is true that forgetting our previous lives can cause us to stubbornly repeat the same mistake. On the other hand, the lessons in negative karmic experiences are sufficiently generic and self-contained that they don’t require you remembering specifically what originally set them in motion. Learning it the generic way ensures that it is your soul that learns and not just the mechanical aspect of your brain. When the brain remembers painful consequences of past actions, it then avoids similar actions to avoid similar consequences, but that kind of learning does not come from within the soul because even lowly animals learn that way. When such animals are made to forget their mistakes, they repeat them endlessly and mechanically. And yet the soul can do much better because instead of relying solely upon memory or programmed instinct, it can directly and immediately understand the deeper nature of the problem and act in the moment. So not remembering what brought you negative karma should not cause despair because understanding is all that’s needed.
Knowing the law of karma is important for several reasons. First, it urges you to be more careful with your choices, words, and actions because these have consequences that will eventually return to you. How you affect the world now determines how the world will affect you later. Second, it makes you look for the deeper meaning behind your current unavoidable life conditions, allowing you to better understand and accept that which you cannot change. And third, you can put an end to otherwise avoidable painful experiences by finding and applying the missed lessons that keep attracting them.

Cosmology
Creation and Evolution
How did life and reality come into existence? I doubt anyone can answer this completely and accurately. But if we can take all facts and observations into account and come up with something that explains them logically and consistently, we will have a pretty good theory to start with. Science has some answers but limits itself solely to physical things, leaving out everything having to do with mind and soul. Better theories like the following one should take both physical and spiritual facts into account.
If physical reality is the creation of something beyond it, then that something must be beyond physical, it must be mind or consciousness. Notice how our dreams do not create our minds, rather our minds create the dream. In dreams, you can sometimes trace back the sequence of events until you reach the point where it all began, which is when you fell asleep. Science can trace the universe back to the Big Bang but no further because beyond that point matter, energy, space, and time as we know them did not exist because they were not yet created. What existed before and continues to exist beyond physical reality is a mind so infinite that it holds within it the power to create everything that can ever be created and the potential to experience every last bit of that creation. We may call this mind God or Creator.



44 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
Upon falling asleep, your mind turns inward upon itself and projects forth the dreamer, the dreamscape, and the multiple dream characters who seem to have a mind of their own despite being projections of the same mind. Dreaming is how a single mind can experience itself as separate beings. And in the beginning, the Creator was a single mind, infinite but alone.
Our reality was dreamed into existence by the Creator so that it might explore its single infinite self through an infinite number of finite minds. One of those finite minds became you after a long process of development, and your mind will continue growing toward infinity until it merges with the infinite mind of the Creator. Then your journey through reality will have ended, but it would have been just one path among an infinite number of different paths the Creator could have taken to experience itself.
The physical universe provides space and matter so that separate minds may have bodies in which to experience themselves, the world, and each other. But there is more than one universe...in fact there are an infinite number of them, one for every possible arrangement of matter, every moment in time. What we see as a universe that changes over time is actually a sequence of stationary universes that are each slightly different than the previous one, similar to how a film projected onto a movie screen appears to move but is in fact a sequence of still images shown in rapid succession.
Not only is there a universe for each moment of time, but also one for every possibility imaginable. If in the next moment something happens but it could just as well have happened a million other ways, there exists a million and one different universes for that moment alone. Now consider all the moments spanning the beginning to end of time, and you will have an idea of just how many universes there are. And all of these were thought into existence by the Creator during the birth of reality. In other words,



Cosmology 45
everything that has, could, or will physically exist, already exists. These universes form an unchanging but infinitely complex matrix of possibilities. We may call this the “fractal reality matrix” because fractals are patterns that remain detailed no matter how deeply you zoom into them, therefore they are infinitely complex, while a matrix is an ordered arrangement of elements or medium in which something can grow.
Without consciousness playing its role, the fractal reality matrix would remain an inactive collection of possibilities, a mere thought of the Creator. What breathes motion into it all is consciousness continually determining which universe to experience next, and this process is what creates time. You may notice that time seems to continue by itself without your tediously choosing the next moment into existence. That is because by default the choosing that enables time is done for you by something known as universal consciousness, which is an omnipresent but primitive conscious energy permeating reality. To make a metaphor via video games, universal consciousness is the computer that runs the game, fractal reality matrix is the game code, and we are the game characters.
Life did not evolve from matter, but through it. Matter merely provides bodies for conscious energy to occupy and use as instruments of experience. The more advanced the consciousness, the more complex the body must be to give it expression. A plant has simple consciousness that can exist in a simple plant body, but our minds and souls are relatively more advanced and we therefore require the more complex human body because it allows us more freedom of experience than a plant body might.
Souls eventually outgrow their bodies, and then they graduate towards a new and improved kind. The conscious energy in a species of plant may develop enough to eventually require a form that can move around instead of being rooted in one spot, so it incarnates into a lower animal form. An advanced animal like a pet cat



46 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
or dog might grow enough in consciousness to incarnate as a human next time.
Mankind as a whole will eventually graduate to what we might call superhuman, alien, or angelic form, but even now this graduation is possible for individuals who reach a sufficient level of spiritual advancement within their lifetimes. Jesus was an example, and his wisdom and superpowers were examples of what we all can achieve if we dedicate ourselves. Beyond even the superhuman stage, mind may continue evolving without a physical body, existing instead in a permanent energy body entirely free from the limitations of space and time. At that point the mind can reach back in time and commune, protect, or assist its various incarnations in the past; an example of this would be the higher self.
In summary, possibilities provided by the fractal reality matrix are selected and animated by the universal consciousness to produce physical reality. Physical reality provides a growth medium for life to develop and condense into individual minds that undergo a long journey of conscious advancement ever closer towards unifying with the Creator. Consider that all this takes place within the mind of the Creator, that both physical body and nonphysical mind are made of consciousness but that matter is “frozen” consciousness while mind is “active” consciousness.
The Growth Toward Polarization
People are at different stages of development. All have the same potential to become perfect, but it will take some longer than others if they are younger souls who have much learning ahead of them. Some of those with the youngest souls have recently graduated from the animal kingdom, and their first several lives as humans are brief and crude. The oldest souls are superhuman masters of knowledge and wisdom who have overcome the limitations and ignorance that still challenge others. The majority of mankind



Cosmology 47
resides somewhere between these two extremes of animalistic and superhuman existence.
Young souls are not self-aware enough to know the difference and relation between themselves and others, and so they tend to see other people as things necessary for their own survival rather than independent beings who have their own needs. But as the soul develops from lifetime to lifetime, it becomes increasingly selfaware and eventually acquires the ability to choose its relation to others and the world. That choice is whether to gain at the expense of others by manipulating them, or gain through the benefit of others by helping them. It is basically a question of selfishness versus compassion, imbalance versus balance, stealing versus sharing, darkness versus light. The self-serving attitude we may call “negative” and the all-serving attitude we may call “positive.”
The choice between negative and positive is an ongoing total of the little choices we make each and every day. When you gain pleasure from the suffering of others, when you express hate for them because they are different from you, when you make them give up what is best for them just to serve you, that is aligning with the negative. When you gain happiness from the growth of others, when you remember that despite differences everything is an expression of the same Creator, when you make choices based on what is best for all in the long run, that is aligning with the positive. As humans we have within us two opposing forces, one calling us higher toward the positive, the other pulling us lower toward the negative. Some days one is stronger than the other. The more often we obey a force, the stronger it becomes. So as time goes on, a soul tends to align itself more strongly with one force while the other grows fainter.
At the top of human development are people who are either very positive or very negative. The very positive ones have golden hearts and the wisdom to effectively serve mankind, while the



48 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
negative ones have darkened hearts and the intelligence to manipulate mankind. Upon reaching a certain purity of positivity or negativity, they grow beyond being human and become something more angelic or demonic. Each of us has the potential to do likewise, depending on which force within us we consistently choose to act upon.

Higher Negative Forces
What motivates negative beings? Mostly they are driven by hunger that can only be satisfied at the expense of others. They believe this world is one of survival and competition where everything is eating and being eaten, where the strong have the right to feed upon the weak, so their primary motivation is to grow stronger and climb higher on the food chain. The more they get, the more they want. Food is not the only thing one can hunger for. Human predators may hunger for money, sex, drugs, or power.
Life in this universe has been around for billions of years, enough time for extremely negative beings to evolve. These ancient superhuman predators are what we might call demons or negative aliens. What they seek is total control over all life in all universes, to become gods of reality. They are fragments of the Creator who have rejected the infinite Creator, who seek unity not by merging themselves with the Creator as positive beings might, but by absorbing all other life into themselves. This absorption happens through an ongoing process of manipulating the minds and consuming the soul energy of others.
When a higher negative being successfully manipulates your mind and consumes your soul energy, you lose your freewill and become an instrument for that being. You may be used to ma



50 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
nipulate others into giving up their freewill as well, and they may then do the same to others; think of how vampires turn their victims into vampires also. In this way, negative beings establish large hierarchies (tiered systems of control) where each level feeds on those below while being fed upon by those above.
Negative hierarchies would have overrun reality were it not for higher positive forces helping enough individuals become aware of manipulation to resist it, but not everyone listens to the positive force and those who choose negative are slowly absorbed into the negative hierarchy. In all likelihood, half of advanced life in this universe is positive, the other half negative, there being a balance between these, but the ratio fluctuates over time and varies with location. Some planets or sectors of galaxies are highly negative, others highly positive. Earth resides in a mixed region where the balance of power shifts frequently in cycles.
The Energy Farm
Just as we farm crops and livestock for food and clothing, so do negative forces farm humans and other sentient beings for soul energy and biological materials. To them we are nothing more than cattle to be used as they see fit. They patiently roam through the galaxy creating or enslaving civilizations to serve as their natural resources. In many ways earth is such a farm, one through which alien and demonic forces harvest our soul energies.
As horrible as that sounds, know that there are ways to break free from getting harvested, and that life on earth is equally as much a school or game serving positive functions. So there is hope; it’s just a matter of getting wise about how negative forces operate so that we can choose a more positive alternative to what they offer us, and so that we become more skilled at evading their attempts to deceive and control.



Higher Negative Forces 51
To understand the energy farm, we must understand soul energy. It is what gives you life and creativity. It is the fuel that gives your soul expression through the body, fuel that propels you toward higher ideals, fuel that allows you to contribute in a meaningful way to the world around you. When you are low on soul energy, you don’t feel like doing anything important, you feel blah and are easily distracted or persuaded. Getting a good night’s sleep, breathing more deeply, meditating, being inspired by a new idea, or eating something healthy recharges your soul energy to varying degrees. Nevertheless, a lifetime of being drained daily of soul energy does take its toll. People who get little sleep, have negative attitudes, and are beaten down in life may spiritually shrivel up by the time they reach their forties; they become empty husks of their former selves, having lost that sparkle in their eyes, not caring to do anything new and meaningful, and shuffling through the rest of their lives on autopilot.
We are born with a basic reservoir of soul energy to get us started, to which is added or subtracted more energy depending on what we go through in life. Most of our energy is recharged during sleep when our etheric body “opens its pores” and like a sponge soaks up energy directly from the Creator who streams it freely out of every point in space. Once within us, it becomes raw energy that keeps us awake during the day until it runs low and we become sleepy again. Emotions are the result of this raw energy transforming into a more refined state. Positive emotions turn it into high frequency energy, negative into low frequency.
Superhuman negative beings are operating at a low frequency and are therefore sustained by low frequency energy. In fact, their low frequency shuts them out from accessing energy supplied by the Creator as easily as we can, and so they try to take it from us instead. Therefore they require that we experience negative emotions so that our raw energy turns into the negative energy they feed upon. When we succumb to fits of despair, hatred, suffering,



52 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
or fear, we temporarily sink to a low vibration and lose energy to these beings. This leaves us especially drained because our temporarily lowered vibration also constricts the flow of energy we receive from the Creator, so in addition to losing some, we are momentarily prevented from recharging.
We also give off energy when experiencing positive emotions, but this does not deplete us as much because being positive raises our frequency, which connects us more strongly with the Creator and increases our intake of raw energy—even while awake. That’s why being in a particularly good mood makes us smile, puts a bounce in our step, and makes us want to sing; it charges us with life. Also, negative beings cannot easily consume our high frequency energy, so staying positive is the best way to avoid losing energy to them. The only time positive emotions drain us is when we get overly giddy about some selfish anticipation or fulfillment, then we quickly burn up our day’s supply of raw energy while the lowly intent behind the emotion reduces our connection to the Creator.
Aside from harvesting our energy through negative emotions, negative beings can also siphon our raw energy directly so long as two conditions are met. The first condition is that the etheric body must have its “pores open” so that the energy within is accessible from the outside; this happens when we are awake but in a state of trance, like when we are spacing out. The second condition is that a negative being, or someone they can work through, is close enough to connect using etheric tendrils to drain off the raw energy.
People through whom negative beings can siphon the energy of others are not aware that they function as “drinking straws,” but staying around one can leave you quickly drained regardless; you may feel a strong desire to nap afterwards. Should you ever be in the presence of an energy drainer, stay mentally alert and intend



Higher Negative Forces 53
that any attempt to drain your energy fail. This keeps your etheric body tight and guarded. Being aware and intending protection is effective, even more so if you manage to maintain a positive mood as well.
Not everyone who drains your energy is under the control of negative beings. Some are simply absorbing energy to keep for themselves. They have probably picked up that habit without knowing it; perhaps they have been abused or neglected in life and make themselves feel better by milking attention from others, which is really a method of stealing energy. How? They always ask for your time and energy, help and advice, without ever actually learning and growing from the interaction. Or they may be the loudest and cockiest people in a social group, always doing the talking and bossing to receive the total attention and energy of others. Whatever the case, they are psychic vampires whether they know it or not, and until they learn to find happiness without putting aside their consideration for others, they will keep doing what they do. Staying alert and intending that your energy stay shielded works here as well, but as a last resort it might be necessary to be firm and simply walk away if they get too demanding or commanding. More on these later.
You might be wondering whether negative emotions have any purpose at all, whether it is okay to feel sad when a pet dies, to feel angry when someone has caused you harm, to feel fear if you are in some kind of danger. But feeling sad may help you reflect on good memories and see the value in things formerly taken for granted, or sadness may drive you towards giving up and hurting yourself. Anger can motivate you to redress an injustice in a wise manner, or it can blind you into doing something that gets you arrested. Fear can alert you to a danger and quicken your ability to escape it, or fear can make you see danger where there is none. So as long as the emotion moves you towards constructive thinking and acting



54 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
then these emotions are appropriate, but if they lead to destructive consequences in the long run, then they are not appropriate.
Even when a negative emotion is appropriate, experiencing it releases energy that feeds the negative beings. But that is fine under normal circumstances, just as it is fine for discarded kitchen scraps to be eaten by worms. Every life lesson we learn comes with an expression of emotion since the energy is required to stamp the lesson deep into our souls before it is released. Negative emotions help us learn, but the same lessons can be learned even better with positive emotions if we strive to understand and act on the lesson calmly and swiftly rather than letting the experience develop toward teaching us the lesson through the last resort of pain. It is therefore in the best interest of negative beings that we remain as stupid and blind to our life lessons as possible so that it takes numerous painful experiences before we finally learn. The more numerous and intense these negative experiences, the more energy we expend learning that lesson, the more negative beings have to harvest. They are like tollbooth operators who charge us for going down their road, except by distracting and confusing us we go in circles tying to find our way and pay the toll over and over.
To summarize, negative beings may drain our soul energy by connecting directly to our etheric bodies to collect raw energy, having us learn lessons through negative emotions, nudging us towards expressing negative emotions in a destructive manner so that the consequences bring us more suffering, and ensuring that the completion of life lessons is delayed so that increasingly painful experiences naturally arise to help one remember or understand the lesson.
There is an additional method, which requires that we express negative emotions for no productive reason. When we watch the news and get angry about things we can’t do anything about, we lose energy for nothing. When we watch movies and get extremely



Higher Negative Forces 55
fearful, angry, or sad, we lose energy for nothing because it’s just a movie. Same when we get wrapped up in sports or video games. When we get into an argument over nothing due to a misunderstanding, the energy we expend goes to waste. When random accidents happen that put us through great stress even though things end up turning out fine, all that worrying was pointless. When we have imaginary arguments in our head or are constantly distracted by mental noise and babbling, we lose energy over stuff that isn’t even real. And yet, the negative beings still get what they want. This is probably the primary way they harvest energy from humans, through distractions and illusions that cause us to mistakenly give our energy despite getting nothing valuable in return, not even lessons.
What’s so bad about losing energy when you can just go to sleep and wake up feeling better? Well, if your goal is simply to get by in life, to get through your day at work or school and be a productive member of society, then it is enough to gain back through recharging what you lose by living. But more is needed to become truly spiritually empowered; to break free from the energy farm we must accumulate positive energy day after day. Humans do not have super powers such as mind reading, seeing etheric energy fields, being able to levitate, making themselves invisible, or walking through walls because they lack the necessary energy and awareness to do so. Being alert and awake during the day makes you a finely functioning human, but breaking free of control from negative beings requires that you become more than human, and therefore you will need more energy than normal humans need. It comes down to guarding yourself against all these mentioned forms of energy drain,* while raising your frequency (elevating your mood and awareness) in order to increase the intake of energy from the Creator.

Aliens
According to modern science, humans naturally evolved on earth from ape-like ancestors to become the most intelligent species on this planet and possibly this universe since there has been no evidence of intelligent life elsewhere. But the truth is completely opposite: humans are not alone in the universe, are not the most intelligent species, and did not evolve naturally on earth.
Countless alien civilizations populate this galaxy; many are millions of years older than our own. Advanced aliens have been visiting earth for a long time; some were responsible for seeding human life on earth and other suitable planets. This means mankind did not even originate on earth, so technically speaking we are aliens as well but have lived here so long we think otherwise. Aliens still occupy this planet by living in bases hidden deep underground or underwater, or inside mountains, and traveling via cloaked ships, underground tunnels, or teleportation gates.
While there are at least fifty different alien species on earth, only a few are highly negative or highly positive. The negative ones mentioned earlier use mankind as a natural resource. Neutral aliens are here mostly to live, observe, and learn. Positive aliens have an interest in helping individuals break out of the energy farm and become superhuman. In reality things are more complicated since

any single alien faction can have multiple purposes, but the point is that negative ones basically seek to use us, positive ones seek to help us. The most common alien types are the grays, reptilians, mantids and nordics.* Grays are short robotic beings with large heads, pale skin, and dark eyes. Reptilians are tall intelligent beings with slit pupils and scaly skin. Mantids look like man-sized praying mantises. Nordics are indistinguishable from humans but tend to be more muscular with exclusively blond hair and light colored eyes.
It is not possible to say that one alien species is absolutely positive and another negative since within the same species there may be examples of both, but for some types the orientation is more clear-cut than others. For example, grays are not a unique race of sentient beings with freewill, rather they are genetically engineered automatons programmed to do menial labor for their reptilian creators, and since only negative aliens resort to using artificial slaves, the existence of positive grays is virtually zero. Reptilians fill the ranks of ancient empires that have conquered and enslaved numerous worlds. Over time this activity has bred out much of their former individuality, and so the majority of reptilians today are part of negative factions. Positive reptilians are in the minority, having split off from the negative groups to use their cunning and power towards liberation instead of manipulation. Nordics have more freewill and variety than reptilians, being a more ancient and perfected race. Half of all nordics are negative, half positive. Negative nordics are superiors to the reptilians and function as their dark overlords, being either possessed or guided by demonic entities that command and empower them. Positive nordics are

equally powerful but working in service to the Creator as divine warriors.
Higher Dimensional Origins
These aliens are not physical in the same way we are. They can dematerialize and walk through walls, travel back in time, levitate, move objects with their minds, appear to us in an etheric state without their physical bodies, talk to us telepathically, enter our dreams, and become invisible. These are powers that come with being superhuman, and indeed they are highly advanced because they live in a higher dimension interpenetrating ours.* To enter our world, higher dimensional beings must focus themselves into a narrow range of vibration to intersect our dimension, otherwise they remain invisible to us. We are like fish unaware of being watched by people outside the aquarium, people who can choose to make their presence known by tapping on the glass or sticking their fingers in the water.
Technically speaking, despite coming from a higher dimension these negative beings exist beneath us in that dimension. To better understand this, think of how the surface of a table has only two dimensions (length, width) while the space beneath the table has three dimensions (length, width, height). Our three dimensional reality is simply a surface surrounded by negative and positive four dimensional (4D) space. Beneath is where negative beings with low soul vibrations exist, above is where positive beings with high soul vibrations reside. Negative beings require considerable soul energy to project themselves “upward” into our three dimensional reality, while positive beings can simply “drop down” for a visit.
In their natural state, reptilians exist in negative 4D space, an etheric level where time and reality is more fluid and responsive to
*ultra-terrestrials, transdimensional beings, interdimensional entities, fourth density

their thoughts. With an expenditure of energy, they can change their vibrational rate to become temporarily physical like us, but in order to conserve energy they prefer staying back in their native environment. Grays are designed to operate in our reality while being telepathically controllable from the higher dimension, so aside from being artificially intelligent workers they can also function as remote controlled probes through which the reptilian mind may operate. In this way, the reptilians can stay in their dimension while still remotely interacting with ours. Nordics, being relatively more powerful, can stay in our dimension more easily.
Being higher dimensional affords them many advantages and disadvantages. As an advantage, their etheric technology is four dimensional and able to operate outside our concept of time, so reptilians can see and manipulate our possible past, present, and future realities simultaneously. It is like being up in a helicopter seeing all the roads of a city below when someone on the ground sees only the road ahead. They are capable of engineering very complicated and far-ranging manipulations like changing the past in little ways to affect the choices you are likely to make in the present. Negative aliens don’t know which choice we will make, and they cannot change the choices we have already made, but they can see and change everything else.
As a disadvantage, their etheric state of existence keeps them from easily violating your freewill, from using force to override your choices, since force is something that only comes with being physical. But they can still tweak the circumstances surrounding your choices to pressure you into choosing something bad for you and good for them. It is by tweaking the past to create difficulties in the present, by looking ahead to see what you might do, by telepathically manipulating the weakest minds of those around you, that they can create negative and artificial synchronicities. And through these tools they manipulate minds and make souls suffer so that the energy farm they operate receives its harvest.

Origins of Mankind
Humans did not evolve naturally on earth. For millions of years what did evolve naturally were the various apish species that science considers our ancestors. But starting several hundred thousand years ago, advanced alien groups began modifying these primitive apes to become more intelligent and dexterous so that they could be used for slave labor. Since that time, this upgraded species has been upgraded again and again, becoming less like apes and more like the aliens themselves. Other alien groups did their own modifications, creating their own unique types of humans by inserting the genetics of several different alien races. This led to a great diversification of the human species, differences in skin color, hair types, and other less obvious traits.
That aliens genetically engineered mankind means only that they created our bodies, not our souls. The soul to its body is like a driver to his car. When a car company manufactures a new model, the driver can switch over to the newer model. People today drive models that look very different from what people drove nearly a century ago. Same with the bodies our souls wear today versus what they occupied at the dawning of mankind. The various races of people we see today originated with different alien groups who engineered them to suit different environments and purposes. In fact, white people with light colored hair and eyes were not origi

nally meant to live on earth, but were created to exist on planets further away where daylight was dimmer. One theory suggests there existed a planet between Mars and Jupiter that was destroyed long ago, forcing its fair-skinned inhabitants to evacuate to the next most-suitable planet, Earth. The appearance of white people in human history happened so quickly that natural evolution cannot account for it. Because this is not their natural planet, they suffer greater health problems like light sensitivity, acne, and sunburns than other races more suited to Earth conditions. The important point is that humans exist all throughout the galaxy, varying mainly in their outer appearance and inborn abilities depending on what alien groups made them.
While some human souls originated only recently from the animal kingdom, others are older than even the creation of the human species. These ancient souls once existed in a higher and less physical state but chose to descend into the denser human bodies in order to gain from the challenging experience. The price was forgetting who they really were, of living in primitive and violent conditions for thousands of lifetimes, of being used as slaves and sources of soul energy by the negative alien groups having created those physical bodies. But today we are at the point where these older souls can finally have a chance to regain their former identities and powers, this time with all the additional knowledge and strength they have gained from being human for so long. What they have gained most is wisdom and discernment—the ability to think and tell the difference between truth and deception, something they were not able to do prior to entering into human form because they were isolated and naive like innocent and overprotected children.
This is one interpretation of the Adam and Eve story: two innocent people (ancient but naive souls) whom the “serpent” (reptilian aliens) tempted to eat from the Tree of Knowledge (opportunity to learn discernment) and who were subsequently cast out of para

dise (higher ethereal existence) into the wilderness (physical existence).
When Civilization Restarted
What is today accepted as the history of human civilization goes back no further than ten thousand years, starting with the writings left behind on clay tablets by ancient cultures of the middle-East known as the Sumerians and later the Babylonians. No major written records are available to us from before that time, so it is assumed that prior to ten thousand years ago humans remained as primitive hunters and gatherers until they finally settled into villages and towns by learning to farm and domesticate animals. This version of history taught in schools is tragically and dangerously incomplete.
Thousands of years before even the Sumerians appeared, an advanced civilization called Atlantis flourished. It spanned several continents and possessed technology even more sophisticated than ours today. How did this advanced civilization become nothing more than primitive hunters and gatherers that later developed into the ancient cultures we know about? Atlantis was brought down by a devastating global disaster. Legend says the continent of Atlantis was wiped out by a flood, sinking under the ocean as punishment for being corrupt and evil. Mountain peaks became islands surrounded by water toward which survivors of the flood fled by ship. These survivors then used what knowledge and technology they had salvaged to build settlements and start the human race anew, but this knowledge and technology was gradually lost over generations of turbulent growth and migration. Different regions became home to different groups of survivors who remained isolated from each other, some degenerating quickly and others growing rapidly to advanced levels before succumbing to war, starvation, or disease.



64 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
A split developed between the sophisticated minority of survivors who retained their higher knowledge and technology, and the majority who degraded into primitive cultures. The sophisticated ones hid themselves by living in underground bases, caves, remote mountains, and massive forts, mostly to buy enough time to work with any alien groups willing to help them engineer and implement a long-term plan for rebuilding human civilization. When ready, they ventured out and taught the primitive majority how to cultivate land and domesticate animals, often being perceived as benevolent gods by the primitives. The rest is history.
After the fall of Atlantis, the extremely advanced survivors who became architects of the new civilization agreed it was necessary to rebuild things from the ground up, to erase memory of this cataclysm and cover up any subsequent ones so that eventually mankind would develop into an advanced yet stable and controllable stage once more. Since that time, earth has endured several disasters ranging from ancient nuclear war* to bombardment by objects from outer space,† yet these have all been covered up except the few fragments of truth preserved in myths and religious texts. For instance, Earth was hit around 535 A.D. by a burning shower of comet fragments that plunged Europe into the Dark Ages, yet this too was covered up and today we are taught only that the Dark Ages began when the Roman Empire was overrun by barbarian hordes, which fails to mention that the barbarians could do so because the Empire was weakened by all the burning chaos.
The point is that what we are taught about history is intentionally incomplete and partially false so that by manipulating our perception of the past the controllers can manipulate our creation of the future towards one where they preserve and increase their power.

Origins of Mankind 65
Of course, modern science does not acknowledge this bigger picture of history because in their view there is not enough evidence to support it. Or rather, their accepted version of history is built from false assumptions based on incomplete evidence that have become so deeply embedded in the minds of archeologists that when they discover something that does not fit their version of history, they either keep quiet, destroy the evidence, or come up with an excuse to explain it away as something else. They do this to avoid losing their jobs over being labeled as crazies or frauds should they propose an idea deemed impossible by other closed-minded archeologists and scientists.
This ignorance is no accident; rather it is the intentional result of our “higher” educational system encouraging the suppression of truth. Universities and scientific organizations only receive funding for research that serves the negative system of control (“Control System”) permeating our world.
As long as people believe that mankind has steadily progressed from primitive cave dwellers to modern technological civilization without any cataclysmic setbacks, they will continue feeling safe about the future and will put their trust and effort into their current ways of life because the future is there to reward them. But if they discovered that over twelve thousand years ago an advanced civilization was suddenly wiped out, that the same could happen to our civilization at any time, their faith in the future would not be as strong. Instead of sacrificing themselves for the economic promises of the energy farm so that one day they can collect their retirement funds and enjoy themselves, they might shift priorities and do what makes them happy now instead of later. It would also lead to many other questions like: what technology did the ancients use and how does it work, why has the truth been hidden for so long, how long do we have before earth undergoes another cataclysm? Even knowledge of how the ancients built the pyramids or powered their flying crafts could lead to scary consequences if we



66 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
started using those technologies instead of continuing to pay the electricity and oil companies for energy or airplane industry for travel. Overall it would mean a weakening of the Control System. Therefore truth has been strongly suppressed to keep things stable and predictable.



11
The Control System
What we have today is a Control System designed to regulate every facet of human existence in order to monitor and prevent anyone from discovering or doing something that could destabilize it. It heavily targets people who give others the knowledge they need to see through deception and take back power. Ultimately this goes back to the energy farm that cultivates ignorance and suffering among humans to harvest energy for the advanced negative beings; without an effective Control System, there would be no effective harvesting. Like a dairy farmer, the more efficient his farm and automated his milking machines, the more profit he can reap. What follows is a brief and simplified overview of the main areas of the Control System and how they shape our lives.
Religion
Religion gives people a feeling of security in exchange for unquestioning obedience. On the positive side it encourages devotion to ideals higher than just material success, like helping others or serving a divine cause. On the negative side religion can be horribly misused to program people like robots and make them do stupid things like hate and kill those of a different religion.
The main role of religion throughout history has been to keep society well behaved. This was done by imprinting children with



68 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
moral codes and instilling a fear of authority that shaped them into law-abiding and hard-working citizens. Unlike spirituality, religion aimed to enforce good behavior through programming and intimidation rather than true understanding, so the improvement to society came at the cost of ignorance.
Today, those who are spiritually smart can extract and combine the truths from any religion to increase their own wisdom; those who are spiritually weak join religions simply to belong to something, and they end up swallowing and parroting a rigid belief system that they do not even understand. Sadly, nasty individuals also use religion to make themselves appear nicer than they really are, like wolves dressing themselves in sheep’s clothing. Some of them even become famous preachers or ministers who scam their thousands of naive followers.
But the worst purpose religion serves is to spiritually drain and enslave mankind. Whenever someone blindly obeys questionable sources of authority rather than listening to his own heart, part of his soul shrivels from neglect. Whenever someone begs an external authority for strength and assistance rather than realizing that divine power is within, soul energy is lost to this external authority and it becomes harder to access the inner divine power. Whenever someone believes something without experiencing, pondering, or intuiting it for himself and then goes around pushing it onto others, his ability to think new thoughts decreases and he becomes ever more robotic. Organized religion encourages all of these.
What higher negative forces want is for humans to be wellbehaved robots who freely give up their soul energy, and religion helps accomplish this. When people in church pray towards some statue or image outside of them, their energy escapes into the air where negative forces collect it for their own nefarious uses. Churches can therefore often function as the etheric equivalent of dairy farms. Anyone with spiritual common sense would do well to



The Control System 69
focus on cultivating love and wisdom through private study and personal experience rather than unwittingly selling their energy for it through organized religion.
School
Schools are necessary but far from perfect. The influential people who established our modern school system were businessmen who wanted children to become skilled and obedient workers to man their factories and offices. Therefore they structured schools to churn out mindless workers rather than free spirited and independent thinkers. Students who retain their creativity and independence of mind are capable of earning a living without working for big companies that make up the economic parts of the Control System, and perhaps they even start their own businesses that take money and power away from the Control System.
So although schools teach students the important skills of math, reading, and writing, they serve more to churn out effective workers who are dependent on the Control System than independent thinkers who can find their own way in life. School does this through several manipulative tactics.*
The first method is spending more class time and energy on behavioral conditioning than teaching. Behavioral conditioning means using rules, rewards, and punishments to intentionally mold someone’s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Too many school rules are unnecessary and intended more to make students feel powerless and angry than improve the learning environment.
The second method is hammering into the minds of students a single path through life, one that involves pleasing authority in order to gain the grades and recommendations one needs to get into
* John Taylor Gatto, Prussian School System, Charlotte Thomson Iserbyt



70 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
a good college, to get the diploma one needs to get a good job at a big company, to get the respect one needs to feel good and secure an early retirement. This picture comes with the warning that if you stray from this path, you will end up a starving bum, which is false because some of the richest people in the world never finished college. You don’t have to sacrifice your freedom and dreams to be cared for by the Control System, rather you can use ingenuity and resourcefulness to clear your path through life.
The third method involves structuring textbooks and classes to be as fragmented as possible so that everything is learned in unrelated chunks. This way students memorize the facts in each chunk of a subject and can solve the homework problems, but in their minds these never melt together into a big picture that gives them truly intuitive understanding of the subject necessary to use the ideas and original ways. Students therefore become skilled in doing things only in the way they are taught, losing the ability to come up with better ways, and that is how they become like programmable robots that do their jobs without asking questions.
The fourth method includes twisting facts in textbooks to create a false picture of the world. History and science books are the worst because they are oversimplified for the average mind and written by committees with political agendas, so the actual picture given to students is rarely accurate because it is intended to steer them toward holding only those opinions supported by the Control System. More accurate history and science books can be found in public libraries, but the ones most dangerous to the Control System are only available through the Internet or book catalogs specializing in fringe subjects like conspiracy, paranormal, esoteric, alternative history, alien, and so on. Not to say that all books in libraries and such catalogs are truthful, just that the really good ones are not mentioned in school and often not even available in public libraries.



The Control System 71
The key to beating the school system is to take from it only what you need to accomplish your goals that defy the Control System, and to do most of your learning outside of school through life experience, conversation, pondering, experiments, creative hobbies, and so on. True freedom means making enough money to do what you enjoy, while having enough time and energy left to enjoy it. An easy job that earns you enough is better than a stressful job that earns you more. If whatever you gain from time spent inside the Control System, whether lessons from school or money from work, you apply towards positive and necessary activities that go against the Control System, like educating yourself and others on higher truths, then you are taking power away from something negative and using it to increase something positive. If you are aware of the bigger picture, then you can make it through the school system without getting brainwashed into accepting goals that play on your fears and go against what makes your soul happy.
The Media
Whereas school programs people up until a certain age, the media programs them for the rest of their lives. Newspapers, the nightly news, television, movies—these are all methods through which a person’s opinions can be manipulated. One would think that news exists to tell citizens what’s happening in the world, but in truth it is merely in the business of making money and taking orders from the government, therefore the stories it reports are carefully selected to carry out an agenda, to portray certain shady government actions in a good light, or to entertain viewers with cute stories that have no real practical meaning.
Out of a million things that happen every day, only a few events ever make it onto the news. If a certain theme of events is selected, the viewer sees one picture of the day’s events. If a different set of events are selected, the viewer sees an entirely different picture. For instance, the American Media paints a picture designed to make Americans overly paranoid and fearful of terrorists and criminals



72 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
so that they will support the government’s actions to bomb more countries and take away more of our rights and privacy. In this way people’s perceptions of what’s happening can be manipulated simply by showing them what the media companies and government want them to see. Anything they should not know about is not shown. Important stories that would threaten the Control System by giving people greater awareness are passed over for less significant news like celebrity gossip or some rescued puppy story.
Fortunately there are alternative news outlets that deal with real issues like the fact that the government was responsible for the September 11th attacks, that America is becoming a police state where citizens are under constant surveillance, or that global warming will result in escalating disasters and loss of life. Fortunately the alternative media* exists to cover these, yet is forced to operate through radio, Internet, DVDs, and magazines instead of cable television because these are less regulated. But while the alternative media brings suppressed truths to light, some news outlets are heavily focused on the latest atrocities and injustices in the world that none of the readers can do anything about, and these happen to unintentionally serve the negative higher beings who feed on all the frustration and anger generated by such news stories. To get around this, it is important to remember the bigger picture, to keep a positive attitude of hope and compassion when learning about the rampant problems in this world.
Food and Medical Industries
Healthy people have more money, time, and energy to make a difference than those who are sick, broke, and depressed. The food industry has been steered by the Control System to create unhealthy and tainted diets that lower people’s immune systems and increase their risk of cancer. The medical industry is corrupt and
* alternative news, conspiracy news



The Control System 73
provides overpriced treatments and medicines that merely cover up the symptoms of illness instead of addressing the root cause. As a result people get sick more often and go into debt from unnecessary medical bills.
Doctors are meant only to diagnose and treat what the patient cannot, therefore it is important for the patient to be educated on the symptoms of common illnesses to avoid making expensive doctor visits only to hear the usual: drink lots of fluids and take an over-the-counter fever reducer. Many common illnesses can be self-diagnosed and treated with natural remedies. For instance, ginger root helps get rid of nausea and morning sickness, but the medical industry would prefer making you pay for some fancy drug that does the same thing but with more side-effects and ten times the cost. Melatonin supplements aid sleep and spirulina powder reduces fatigue. People have reported successfully treating cancer with sunshine, fresh air, a positive attitude, and diet consisting of fresh foods and vegetable juices. Learning about natural health lifestyles and remedies gains you further independence from the Control System.
The common diet makes people weak, fat, dumb, and sick. Fluoride in toothpaste and water does more to interfere with brain function than hardening teeth against cavities. White flour in breads and pastries lowers the immune system, accelerates the body’s production of fat cells, and is the leading cause of diabetes. Margarine (vegetable shortening, hydrogenated oils) is not really edible and ends up in the blood stream where it clogs arteries and contributes to heart attacks. Non-fermented soy products contain inedible substances and hormone-mimicking chemicals that interfere with the growth of infants and upset the hormonal balance in adults. Yet these are all things the government, medical, and food industries say are good for us.*

A balanced diet of natural foods like oats and brown rice, light meats, olive oil and butter, fresh fruits and vegetables is healthier, simpler, and cheaper than a diet of breads, cereals with food coloring, preserved meats, and junk food. The junk food industry makes part of its money accepting and incorporating industrial wastes into food products, which is why microwaveable meals, packaged pastries, and chips, contain lists of unpronounceable ingredientsanother reason to replace these with natural healthy alternatives when possible.
The Elite
For thousands of years, individuals who saw themselves as different and better than everyone else have banded together into various groups to coordinate their skills and resources to gain power. They have accumulated wealth and secret knowledge through the centuries to pass on to their descendants. Over time this established influential secret societies and wealthy families who today possess so much power that they can script major world events like wars, economic depressions, and the rise or fall of nations. It is these powerful elite who run the world today and act as the human custodians of the Control System. These bloodlines and groups exist among every race on earth, but some are older and more powerful than others. They see themselves as wolves who have the natural right to prey upon us whom they see as masses of ignorant sheep deserving it, which is false because more people would manifest their potential as aware and empowered spirits if given the chance instead of being overwhelmingly beaten down in life by the various arms of the Control System.
Nevertheless, these elite groups are themselves being controlled by higher negative entities.* Their controllers consist of advanced survivors from past earth cataclysms who currently reside in
* David Icke, Jordan Maxwell, William Bramley, and Michael Tsarion have written comprehensive books on this aspect of the conspiracy.



The Control System 75
sprawling networks of underground cities, or else alien and demonic groups who command or program these elite to do their bidding in exchange for information and occult power. Rather than enslaving a world themselves, higher negative beings always manipulate an elite part of the target population into enslaving the rest.

Alien Deception
While there are positive aliens, let’s concentrate on the negative aliens and why they are here. Like other negative beings, they see mankind as a natural resource to be exploited. Our genetic material, the latent knowledge and power we possess, and our ability to produce generous quantities of soul energy are very attractive to them. They also value earth as a jackpot of needed minerals, a treasure trove of advanced technology stashed here by other alien races over time, and a strategic outpost leveraging their military and political power in the galaxy. The potential for mankind to play an active role in the future destiny of other worlds is immense, therefore those who manage to enslave us by our own choice to submit effectively control the future of these worlds, some of which are not even in our current physical dimension. This is the main prize such negative aliens seek: control over all souls in all dimensions at all times.
By spiritual and galactic law, these aliens require that we willingly hand the planet and ourselves over to them. If we refuse and they use force, then other alien races have the right to intervene and enforce those laws. But if we choose slavery, then these enforcers have no right to interfere. Therefore the negative aliens have been working since time immemorial to manipulate us into eventually giving up our freewill. The reason they have not taken



78 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
control sooner is that they have needed us to be capable of standing on our own, of being unified, willing, and advanced enough to enslave ourselves and join their empire. Previously our population was too small, too scattered, and too primitive. Nowadays technology exists to monitor and control us all, militaries can strike anywhere in the world, and nations that refuse to go along with the rest can be bombed or sanctioned into capitulating. Therefore the time is ripe for negative aliens to begin their final phase of taking over this planet completely. If they succeed, mankind will become their latest and perhaps most powerful asset. They would gain far greater power and resources to establish negative Control Systems on other worlds and thereby expand the energy farm.
The final phase consists of tricking us into welcoming them as advanced helpers who can guide mankind into a new age of peace and enlightenment. While the latter is an important goal, the methods these aliens have prepared are deceptive and will eventually bring about just the opposite. These same forces who have secretly steered mankind toward using polluting technology, who have commanded the negative human elite to initiate world wars, who have corrupted our governments and created judgmental religions responsible for the persecution of millions—these forces will offer solutions to those very problems they created in the first place, on the condition that we unify as a planet under their leadership.* Our human elite controllers are capable of initiating a carefully designed series of shocks to the world in the next several years consisting of widespread diseases, famines, economic crashes, rampant wars, and energy shortages. These will then justify the alien claim that human governments are corrupt and ineffective, lacking the spirituality and wisdom these aliens have, that therefore all governments should obey the wiser guidance of aliens. They will say mankind has destroyed the environment, and only by accepting alien technology can we rescue our planet. They will shower us
* Allies of Humanity, Cassiopaean Transcripts, William Bramley



Alien Deception 79
with medical and technological miracles. Aliens might even say they are good guys who need our cooperation to help them kick “evil” aliens off this planet, and that if we refuse to work with them then these evil aliens will eventually take over the planet. Of course, it would be the same negative alien force playing both good guy and bad guy.
With all the war, pollution, corruption, and misery in this world, who would not accept aliens rescuing us from our problems? Only those who recognize this is all too good to be true, who sense something very wrong with it. The rest will be too awed by alien contact to think straight, too romanced by promises of epic changes to see the deception. People desperately want suffering to end, but this desperation can pull them into choosing something that is ultimately not in their best interests, like thirststricken survivors of a shipwreck drinking ocean water only to die from ingesting too much salt.
What would the future be like were the alien agenda to succeed? At first people would rejoice with peace and happiness that comes with setting aside petty differences and working towards a common good under the guidance of superior intelligences. Any who oppose this—like those who see through the deceptionwould be branded as enemies of mankind, terrorists acting out of racist hatred against the aliens and working to sabotage the promise of peace and unity for our children. Such opposition will be persecuted through a new “war on terror” that uses high-tech methods of surveillance and citizen snitch squads to route out dissidents for “reformation” (brainwashing). In preparation for this, the government has already been made to pour much research money into non-lethal weapons, which are weapons that would allow authorities to subdue angry crowds and disable large numbers of people without killing them, so that millions can be rounded up for isolation, interrogation, brainwashing, or worse.



80 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
Over time, society would be transformed by alien technology including antigravity propulsion, generators that can produce free energy,* the eradication of all illnesses including cancer, remote viewing technology to foresee and stop crimes before they happen, computer-enhanced brain function, and genetic splicing of human with alien DNA to create new generations that are less emotional, more intellectual and psychic. Religion would be replaced by an alien engineered spirituality that preaches unity and allegiance to some divine plan that these aliens have come to implement.
But the technology will create addiction and dependence. It will atrophy people’s spiritual powers and ability to think independently by replacing these with external technological means supplied and controlled by the nonhuman manipulators. The alien spirituality aims to further remove freewill by programming people toward blind obedience and disabling their ability to discern truth or detect deception. Even the genetic changes meant to increase intellectual and psychic powers will merely upgrade humans into a more effective servant race because the truly important abilities like conscience, freewill, emotions, discernment, and inner spiritual awareness will be sabotaged rather than enhanced by the humanalien DNA merger.
In the end mankind would become a mentally enslaved, spiritually deformed, genetically crippled slave species ready to be used as crusader forces in the negative agenda to conquer other worlds. This has already taken place elsewhere and some of the resulting crusader slaves are here now doing the same to us.

Time for a Shift
The future is precarious, hanging in the balance between a true Golden Age of spiritual freedom and a false age of spiritual enslavement. Whatever ends up happening, our perspective and way of life even fifteen years from now will be unimaginably different from those of today. By looking at where current trends are pointing, it is easy to see that in the coming decades society will be transformed by external factors like escalating natural disasters and economic upheavals, mounting clashes between corrupt governments and rebellious citizens, the open disclosure of the existence of aliens, and the unleashing of previously suppressed technologies like antigravity and free energy.
But something else, something bigger is happening than mere social changes that are due to external factors. More people are also shifting internally, becoming more aware and spiritually empowered. But more people are also becoming more ignorant and spiritually dark. There is a polarization phenomenon happening whereby dark is getting darker while light is getting lighter; positive people are becoming more positive, negative people more negative. Such polarization creates tension and conflict that eventually results in a parting of ways. Polarization is also happening on a global scale, which further indicates what the future holds in stock: great tension and conflict followed by a parting of ways.

Anyone who becomes sufficiently positive, spiritually aware, and energized gains access to powers allowing him or her to leave physical reality and inhabit a higher dimension. This is the next step of evolution mentioned previously where a mere human becomes superhuman. It is very difficult to achieve this alone because one is surrounded and held down by the lower awareness and energies of everyone else in this world. But the more people succeed, the easier it is for others to transcend physical reality as well. This is already starting to take shape.
We have reached a point in our destinies where the door to a higher existence is opening. Not everyone will take the opportunity, only those who by their own determination seek out and practice a superior alternative to the limited way of life offered by the Control System. This means that population sectors of a positive orientation either succeed in displacing the dark forces and turn this world into a place of awareness and spiritual liberation, or else they collectively transcend the physical world and enter together into a higher positive dimension. Alternatively those of a negative polarity could either grow strong enough to overrun this world, or else become so negative that they “fall through the floor” and become negative superhumans who join the negative aliens in their higher negative dimension.
If the physical world were to become uninhabitable, say through runaway climate changes or comet impacts, then entering a higher dimension is the most viable option to survive. Ideally, if both positive and negative souls transcended to their respective level within the higher dimension then there would be no competition for the same physical planet. But earth is not the only thing negative forces want. They also desire control over all souls in all times and dimensions. The more souls they control, the more energy and resources they can use to control more souls. Therefore withdrawing with their slaves to the higher negative dimension would not be enough; they would seek to use what they have captured to launch



Time for a Shift 83
further conquests. This means that even after the Shift the battle would continue, only it would be taken up a notch. Positive humans who formerly fought for balance across the globe would, upon becoming superhuman, be battling for balance across all times and dimensions as well.
Time Wars
Strangely enough, this future has already happened. We are now experiencing the backwards effects of a time war between higher dimensional forces of our future. Their technology and their state of being allows for limited time travel and reality engineering.
To illustrate, a group of dark entities could travel back in time and attempt to sabotage an event that eventually gave the positive forces an advantage, which would create a different future where these negative ones have the upper hand instead. In turn the diminished positive forces could re-establish their supremacy by traveling back to insert some new event that compensates for the sabotage. Back and forth this goes. Meanwhile we progress through our lives experiencing the tug of war between both sides, attempts by one side to manipulate or destroy us, attempts by the other side to offer us critical inspiration and crucial intervention to counter these sabotage attempts.
Due to the laws of time travel, these forces are limited in how tangibly they can interact with a targeted individual. Usually they must remain invisible and only exert emotional pressure or telepathic persuasion if negative, or give emotional support and mental inspiration if positive.* But the more serious an attempted violation by negative forces, the more serious and tangible the counter-action by positive forces. For instance, if an oncoming driver were to be telepathically manipulated to space out and drift
* My article Timeline Dynamics explains this in greater detail.



84 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
into your lane and collide with you head-on before it’s your time to die, positive forces could then physically move your car out of the way, cause both cars to pass through each other without touching, or simply mentally compel you to slow down early enough to avoid the collision. These instances are rare but do happen. It is more common for time wars to be fought through the manipulation of our thoughts and emotions than outright physical murder attempts; if you can be telepathically pressured to give up a positive path, or mentally nudged into making an ill-informed decision, that can also change the future.
Most of us never realize how much the future hinges on our decisions. We may not know which decisions are the critical ones, but the more we choose to follow our hearts and act with discernment, the more we ultimately reinforce the positive future, the more easily higher positive forces from that future can support our path towards becoming positively superhuman, towards becoming them.
The Plan
Average people are relatively non-polarized in that they do not go out of their way to manipulate or help others. They wish only to live a comfortable life and are not interested in learning higher truths if these do not cater to their convenience. They are orderly inhabitants of the energy farm, neither threat to the negative forces nor of critical consequence to the positive forces.
Then there are people born with the potential to make a difference. They show a natural curiosity for higher truths, develop a desire in life to help others, and are endowed with maturity and abilities that seem more advanced than heredity or social programming alone can explain. These are the helper souls mentioned earlier. More accurately they are superhuman souls who have volunteered to incarnate back into regular physical bodies to help bust receptive humans out of the Control System. They are advanced



Time for a Shift 85
beings born into the Control System to help bring it down from the inside.*
Helper souls serve an important purpose in the divine plan to counter the negative alien agenda. To the higher positive forces they are like brave paratroopers agreeing to parachute into enemy territory on a dangerous mission of liberation. As mentioned, one risk they face is forgetting who they are when they arrive. Being born as a human infant is extremely traumatizing and the years of social conditioning that follow effectively suppress their higher abilities and memories. Should they survive the gauntlet with enough of themselves intact, they then stand a chance of accomplishing what they came here to do.
If you are unsure whether you are a helper soul, it doesn’t really matter because you can choose to live like one regardless. All you have to do is think, feel, speak, and act from the highest place within you, to identify and follow those interests originating from the real you (higher self), to remove the mask of fears and lowly desires grafted onto you since birth by the Control System. It is by millions of people doing this that pressure builds against the walls of this prison until cracks appear and widen into passages allowing escape. That sounds dramatic, but in practical terms it means that higher souls who stay true to themselves inspire confidence in others and show them the way toward transcending this physical world. It comes down to maintaining an optimistic attitude that acknowledges and sidesteps pitfalls, making choices based on intuition and wisdom instead of social expectation, and serving the spiritual empowerment of others according to ability and circumstance.

The Hyper Dimensional Control System
Negative forces see helper souls as unpredictable and uncontrollable threats to their agenda. Because the Control System depends on people giving it power through their programmed belief in illusory limitations and ignorance of better alternatives, if enough individuals woke up spiritually and put into practice higher abilities and knowledge, the Control System would surely fall like a house of cards. So aside from manipulating and feeding off humans, negative beings use the Control System to suppress or destroy helper souls before they grow strong enough to accomplish their mission.
The lower half of the Control System (media, schools, military, religion, etc...) manipulates the masses and is mostly a third dimensional operation run by people profiting at the expense of others. The upper half is run directly by negative astral, alien, and demonic forces who use sophisticated higher dimensional techniques to target helper souls or recruit specific individuals useful to their agenda. Next I will describe the most common techniques and give you some methods of defense.



88 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
Manipulated Agents
The hyper dimensional Control System has six billion people from which to choose weak minds that can be manipulated into surrounding and spiritually suffocating a budding helper soul.
The less that spirit is present and active in a person, the more he or she is controllable by negative forces. During moments of mindlessness, anyone can be telepathically nudged into doing or saying something regrettable. When we are not fully conscious of ourselves, our emotions can be artificially lowered by technological or psychic manipulations so that we feel unusually irritable and reactive; our thoughts can be steered toward false suspicions and misunderstandings. These things can be used to create fights and distrust between helper souls and those closest to them in life, to break apart what would otherwise have been a promising and helpful relationship.
There are those among us who are so lacking in soul maturity, so afflicted with an absence of spirit, that they are permanent agents of the Control System. These people tend to lack self-awareness and individuality, fail to show true empathy and compassion, and function as tyrants or leeches in the lives of others. Something higher is missing inside them for they act heartless when revealing their true colors. Helper souls are often born into families where at least one parent* or sibling fits this description; if the soul survives growing up with a constant source of torment, it will grow strong from the experience. If the soul succumbs, it becomes too disempowered and traumatized to fulfill its purpose. This is the primary way the Control System deals with helper souls, by breaking or distracting them with permanent agents. If a helper soul can be molded into adopting distrust, lack of self-confidence, emotional neediness, hatred of others, judgmental attitudes, or other dys
* toxic parents, psychopaths, narcissistic disorder, petty tyrants

functions, then that would seriously impair his or her ability to help others in life.
If you happen to be trapped in an inescapable situation with a tyrannical agent, have faith that it won’t last forever. Cultivate some private time to engage in activities that exercise and nurture your interests and creativity, as this keeps the flame of your soul lit during a time of darkness. Refuse to internalize the criticisms showered upon you aimed at making you hate yourself, lose confidence in your abilities, or make you feel like giving up. Refuse to let feelings of inadequacy push you into striving for empty goals that are not your own, like being macho or emotionally hardened just to keep from appearing weak. Refuse to adopt an ignorant system of standards that values negative traits and laughs at positive ones. The ultimate prize for negative beings is turning you into one of them, so fight this and always remember what the real you represents.
Permanent agents are also sometimes used to approach and befriend helper souls in the active stages of awakening in order to lead them astray with false beliefs. For example, if you decide to embark on an intense journey of learning all you can about yourself and reality, the hyper dimensional Control System takes notice and might eventually send someone fishy your way. This person comes to you strongly mirroring many of your beliefs but seems a bit hurried or pressured to build rapport with you. Then the moment they have your undivided attention they quickly switch over to a pile of disinformation, trying to lead you down a line of beliefs that make you feel uncomfortable, trying to make you doubt your own previously gained knowledge and wisdom—not through solid reason but through manipulative tactics. Often they will enter your life with a bunch of really weird synchronicities, like mentioning specific things you have just been researching but no one else knows you have, or talking about their personal history and childhood with details that very oddly and too closely match your own.



90 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
And as soon as you show resistance they switch from sweet to bitchy in a split second. That’s a red flag if they do the 180 ̊ switch as soon as you refuse to bend to their will, which reveals what they are really after.
Other permanent agents can be sent solely to drag you down and burn you out. This person tugs on you to be their teacher, their rescuer, their advisor, etc... and comes off as highly emotionally needy and desperate. Yet no matter what you tell them, they never actually listen or improve. That is the difference between these and just your sincere seeker looking for advice. Instead of actually benefiting from interaction in the fashion of learning, wisdom, or strength, they just ask you for more and more time and energy. It’s like they don’t care about the advice you give them, only that you are being dragged down with them. Functionally they are like energy leeches. Give them a chance to learn from your advice, but if they become a pain in the ass by consistently refusing to help themselves, then walk away.
Both of these will be pretty obvious when you encounter them. There’s this shallow surface mask, and beneath is something nasty that comes out from time to time. It’s the nasty parts that will stand out for you. But do remember there’s a difference between a nice person having a bad day and unintentionally snapping at you, and a dangerous person pretending to be nice except for moments when their disguise slips.
You can sense intuitively what is beneath the surface of someone. Does their niceness seem fake? Does their rudeness seem out of line for them? An easy mistake would be to decide who is positive and negative based on whether they act nice or do nice things versus being mean and aggressive. Con artists put on the charm to fool lonely old ladies all the time; therefore it takes reading between the lines sometimes to notice a permanent agent. Ultimately it doesn’t matter whether they are spiritually asleep or



The Hyper Dimensional Control System 91
lacking spirit, as any person not in control of themselves and engaging in harmful behavior is bad news regardless. If someone is dragging you down, respect yourself and regain some distance.
Successfully dealing with tricky agents requires intuition. Hone your intuition by paying attention to what you feel as you interact with someone and remembering this feeling. Later, after time has passed and they have shown their true colors, you can recall this feeling and make a correlation. Everyone who has ever felt “off” to me eventually ended up visibly revealing his or her negative intentions or purposes. Everyone who has felt fully rounded and goodnatured eventually proved to be creative souls with life spark.
To avoid suspecting the wrong people, don’t go nitpicking for warning signs in the behavior of someone who seems so-so, otherwise you will force yourself to see things as you wish rather than as they are. If there is a warning sign, it will come to you. All you have to do is avoid rationalizing away these warning signs when they smack you in the face. So stay calm and neutral to avoid injecting bias into your observations. Negative entities can use a combination of implanted thought loops and orchestrated misunderstandings to make two positive souls distrust each other, so beware. Unlike real warning signs, artificially induced paranoia comes with an irrational impulse of irritability and oversensitivity instead of a lucid awareness of danger. The difference between prudence and paranoia is that the first is sharp yet serene and free from irrational compulsions, while the second is intoxication.
It is important to remember that these agents are often unaware of what they are doing. They are not to be blamed for their actions because they are not in control of themselves. Therefore have compassion for them and understand that they are mere helpless pawns being used in a game beyond their comprehension. Having compassion does not mean letting them steamroll over you, rather it means being understanding yet discerning and firm,



92 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
putting your foot down when necessary, without having contempt or hatred. And most of all do not lose your hope in humanity by your experiences with the more negative ones. There are other positive souls like yourself who will cross your path when the time is right, and making friends with those on your wavelength can be a source of great relief, strength, and joy.
Abductions and Mind Programming
The most direct and insidious method negative beings use to disable potential threats is to abduct them, alter their minds, and return them home without memories of what transpired. You could go to sleep one night, be abducted, and wake up the next morning having only a vague sense of uneasiness and tiredness. But during the night you may have been aboard an alien ship or in an underground base for several hours, having your mind programmed with hypnotic commands* that stay buried in your subconscious like ticking time bombs. Then in the days that follow these commands are quietly activated and you feel a sudden overwhelming urge to become depressed, to hate or lose confidence in yourself or others, to have irrational or immoral compulsions, or to say something that creates blow ups between yourself and another who may also have been programmed.
Abductions are performed either by negative alien beings or by negative humans with alien technology. The latter consist of highly secret groups within the military intelligence agencies of America, Great Britain, and Israel, groups that have come entirely under the control of negative aliens. Also involved are members of the underground civilization mentioned earlier. All three of these are often seen working side-by-side by abductees who accidentally remember their experiences.

The Hyper Dimensional Control System 93
The abductors possess extremely sophisticated technology. As mentioned, aliens have the ability to freeze time, paralyze and levitate people through solid walls or windows and into their ships or just extract the soul from a person while the body stays in bed. Their ships can pull back into another dimension, fly quickly into outer space, change size and appear much larger on the inside than outside. Advanced military factions have portal technology that creates a wormhole between their underground base and your bedroom through which to transport you. Their bases may be saturated by an accelerated time field so that you can be there for eight hours while only two hours pass back home. They can even put an implant into your brain through which to program you remotely while you sleep.
This all sounds very fantastic, scary, and crazy, but there are enough people remembering their experiences and providing circumstantial clues to suggest that the above is very likely happening. While there is much more to abductions than covered here (like the fact that aliens are also abducting people to harvest genetic material from which to create a race of alien-human hybrids who will act as liaisons between humans and aliens), the important point to remember is that not all your thoughts and compulsions are necessarily your own.
Aliens can program their abductees to fall in love with each other, only to then turn one off and leave the other in anguish at the lack of reciprocation.* They can also program feelings of doom, thoughts of utter despair and pointlessness, or target someone when they are still toddlers and use programming spanning several years to contort a helper soul into becoming antisocial, morally twisted, and emotionally dysfunctional. The military groups tend to program into their targets militant attitudes of survival and competition, like creating an obsession with guns and

94 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
using violence to solve problems; some of these end up becoming school shooters or mad bombers you hear about in the news. Therefore it is very important to watch your thoughts and feelings and avoid giving unchecked expression to those impulses that are unnecessarily hostile, depressing, obsessive, or self-destructive.
Signs of having been abducted include waking up suddenly with a panicked feeling that something evil is lurking in the room, waking up early in the morning feeling alert as though not having just been asleep, or waking up at your usual time but feeling extremely tired or sore in disproportion to what you did the day before. If you have pets, these can also be frazzled or hostile after having witnessed the abduction. Your mind might be exceedingly spacey or fuzzy during the day as a result of the intense programming that happened. You might have anomalous bruises, scratches, or scars on your body that were not there the night before; some of those are due to implants being put in to track and monitor your position, vital signs, thoughts and feelings. Precursors to abduction include seeing visions of aliens when you close your eyes to go to sleep, seeing warning numbers or experiencing a ringing in your ears up to an hour or two before going to sleep, and having pets be unusually aggravated or responding to invisible things moving around the room.
Preventing abductions is not always possible, therefore doing damage control afterwards by nipping programmed thoughts in the bud is the first and foremost line of defense. But abductions can be cut down in their severity and occurrence through the following methods.
First, it is important to have humor and confidence, warding off fear and obsessive paranoia because the latter lower your soul vibrations and make it easier for other-dimensional aliens or the military teleportation technology to tune into and extract you for an abduction.



The Hyper Dimensional Control System 95
Second, it is a well-known fact that most abductions happen when one is sleeping, and that people who can be snatched while awake (like when driving down a dark rural road) are those who are sufficiently weak in their soul strength and awareness. This shows that freewill, soul strength, and conscious awareness are powerful obstacles to abductions—staying awake on nights when precursors signal an impending abduction will stop them cold, but if that is not possible then use a voice-activated tape recorder to catch any unusual physical activity during the night; by reviewing the tape in the morning and becoming aware of it, abductors have a more difficult time showing up without being caught. Several years ago during a period of frequent abductions I set up a motion-activated webcam to record myself sleeping—that night the power went out six times, each time rebooting the computer and stopping the recording. The abductors were not happy that I did this, but the incident goes to show such a thing does interfere with their ability to do as they please.
Third, before going to sleep you can intend strongly that you stay free of all negative interference through the night until time to get up. You can send an earnest request to positive forces, to your higher self, to protect you. And you can try boosting your soul frequency momentarily by thinking or remembering something that makes you feel good, then visualize your room or apartment surrounded by a solid spherical shield of glowing light. All of these help to anchor your intent and reinforce your choice against being abducted.
The level of technology used in abductions is so advanced that it must take into account metaphysical laws, not just physical ones. These laws basically say, “You can do whatever you want to your target except that which absolutely violates his or her freewill. So there are certain manipulations you will find impossible to carry out.” One such obstacle is killing the target directly; this is rarely allowed unless the target is weak and willing enough (like if weak

ened in soul strength through prolonged drug abuse, having invited negative forces through occult rituals, thinking all aliens are good and asking to meet them, and so on). Because of these restrictions, abductors resort to “softer” and more permissible methods like mind programming, which over time can drive the abductee into destroying himself if he chooses to obey these irrational thoughts and compulsions. The fact that he has choice in that situation is what preserves freewill according to metaphysical law. So the more aware you become of what they are doing to you (if you happen to be an abductee) and the stronger you set your intent to be free from abductions, the less they can abduct without violating your freewill.
Dimensional Weather and Cyclical Influences
No doubt certain days seem better and calmer than others. Some days it seems like all hell is breaking loose and people have gone nuts. When numerous individuals in different locations undergo similar negative experiences at the same time, some bigger influence is at work than just getting up on the wrong side of the bed.
The strongest of these influences is the moon. According to folklore a werewolf transforms from a regular person into a ravenous beast on the full moon. The term lunatic comes from the old belief that lunar influences aggravate the mentally ill. These are pretty close to the truth; the new and full moons, and the two or three days before and after, are days on which the potential for negativity are greatly heightened because the darkness within us is amplified and we become more easily aggravated, reactive, insulted, or depressed. Full moons bring out an extroverted darkness that can push one into lashing out insensitively at others, whereas new moons exacerbate the introverted darkness that causes one to become oversensitive and easily offended or demoralized.*
* See my article Food for the Moon



The Hyper Dimensional Control System 97
What happens during these lunar windows is analogous to weather turning turbulent and creating conditions ripe for the sudden appearance of storms. Sometimes you only hear thunder, other times a tornado rips through town. Conditions are heightened for the sudden outbreak of tension between people. What also increase are negative synchronicities, those highly improbable “accidents” that really get you down. The mechanism behind lunar influences has to do with alignments between earth, sun, and moon that create gravitational field disturbances. These temporarily muddy the boundary between our dimension and the higher negative dimension, allowing negative forces and energies to more easily manipulate us. Other influences that disturb the boundary between dimensions include solar activity like sunspots, solar wind streams, and geomagnetic storms; weather fronts passing directly overhead; and recent major disasters in the world because the increased death and suffering gives the Control System extra energy to manipulate other targets.
These are times when the energy farm collects its “rent.” The important thing to understand is that if around a new or full moon you find yourself having a very bad day, know that it will blow over like any storm and that some people simply aren’t acting like themselves. Pay attention to the dreams you have that occur during the several days before a new or full moon; these will often symbolically clue you into what is right around the corner. If you successfully determine from these the nature of the upcoming problem, your very awareness of it can prevent it from ever happening, as can your commitment to be positive during a lunar window. Be extra watchful during such times and keep a tight leash on your emotional reactions.






15
Emotional Balance
When you’re feeling down, you’re feeling down. The biggest problem is that unjustified negative emotions limit perception, meaning you fail to recognize, remember, or observe the positive side of things. Your decisions and train of thoughts are affected and you create negative consequences that stick you deeper in the mud. This creates a vicious cycle whereby a negative attitude creates negative experience that further reinforces the negative attitude.
What makes a negative emotion unjustified is that it either outlasts the event that provoked it and no longer serves purpose in motivating you to resolve the problem, or else it descends upon you without an external triggering event. One example of the latter would be lunar influences: on certain days you might feel very irritable or depressed, but these feelings arise by themselves. Only after you let it steer your train of thoughts does the feeling then seem to have justification. Maybe after a feeling of gloom comes over you, you start thinking about all the things wrong with your life, which only deepens your melancholy. Or maybe you feel irritated for no reason, but because of this someone innocently rubs you the wrong way and after snapping at them a verbal fight breaks out, making you really feel irritated. But all these start with an unjustified negative attitude, and if you can nip them in the bud



100 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
then you won’t be creating the mental or physical consequences that would further reinforce them.
The only way to break out of a negative state is to choose a more positive alternative out of your own freewill. Freewill implies choosing what you prefer for the future, not what you feel justified in continuing based on the past. So if you were stuck in a negative attitude justified by all the thoughts, memories, and consequences created by it, you could easily think, Why should I feel positive? Look at all this misery I am surrounded by, but that is choosing to perpetuate the past, not initiate a new future. The proper response would be, I understand that emotionally I am not sober right now, therefore I choose to turn things around. By turning around your emotional state you then see things more clearly and realize that the only reason your negative attitude felt justified before is because your awareness was constricted.
The first step is to become aware of yourself while you are still overcome by a negative emotion. If instead of blindly obeying the emotion you catch yourself and simply observe your own internal sensations for a minute (racing pulse, knot in your throat, throbbing face, heaviness on your head and shoulders...) then that helps to disengage you from the impulse so that it may subside.
After becoming aware of the situation, you can then choose a technique to pull yourself out. The external quick fixes for emergencies involves taking several deep breaths, eating something (especially chocolate), going for a walk, or taking a nap, but these are just temporary solutions that border on being cop-outs. Another solution is to talk it over with someone you can trust; often when a negative attitude is externally imposed by dark forces seeking to get you into a fight, mentioning it to the other person (if they are open minded to that possibility) stops the attempt and causes the negative pressure to suddenly lift.



Emotional Balance 101
The ideal technique is an internal one whereby you transform your negative emotions into positive, degree by degree.* One such method is called a lifeline. When you are drowning in negativity you need a lifeline to pull yourself back to shore. Something must lead from your drunken state to sober state in order for you to follow. Without it, you are not equipped to make that transition. During states of what ultimately turn out to be unjustified negativity, rather than reasoning your way out, simply pull yourself up a “rope” leading toward a more balanced state. This rope can be a prayer, an affirmation, a meditation, an inspirational booksomething that guides you internally toward regaining emotional balance. As mentioned earlier, negativity clouds perception and subjectively rearranges, distorts, and blots out the perceived facts. But a prayer, meditation, sequence of spiritual facts coming from a place of sobriety and anchored in print or memory, this survives any transition you make into negativity and serves as a lifeline back out toward clarity and balance.
If this idea appeals to you, try creating your own lifeline to call upon when necessary. It can be a message to yourself written while in a positive state to be read later when you are under pressure. It can be a short poem to ponder, progressing degree by degree from negative to positive (sorrow, compassion, understanding, acceptance, comfort, hope, gratitude, enthusiasm, joy and finally love). It can be a book of wisdom tidbits that remind you about spiritual truths and the bigger picture. Sometimes it is enough to turn within and focus on the word “peace” or “gratitude” for a couple minutes. Actually, with sufficient willpower and focus you can dispense with mechanical tools altogether and simply turn within, think of your spiritual self and the grandness of the universe, and thereby raise your frequency to an exalted state. But under severe pressure the lifeline can be a godsend.

Battle of Opposites
An important step in waking up and beginning your journey towards greater awareness is discerning between the positive and negative, between what lifts up and what drags down. As spiritual beings inhabiting physical bodies, we are caught in a battle of opposites. This manifests within as a battle between our higher and baser natures, and outside as a battle between divine and diabolical forces. What is within resonates with what is outside, the divine resonating and working with our higher self and the diabolical doing the same with our lower self. Every moment offers a choice, and every choice made is a response to the following question: whom will you follow, the lower or the higher?
When faced with a choice, you may feel conflicting influences. One part wants this and another part wants that. For the majority of unaware people, these conflicts are between the various subpersonalities comprising the mosaic of their inconstant minds. But sooner or later the contrast turns up until the conflict becomes primarily between what is written in our hearts and what is programmed into us socially, genetically, and psychologically.
It is not necessary to always know the correct choice in a situation, only that you are choosing from the highest and most sober place within you. The soul grows from hardship regardless of



104 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
where trouble originates, therefore you can get by without having to know the specific methods of deception and persuasion employed by dark forces. Nevertheless, as much as darkness has a place in Creation as mirrors for our own weaknesses and catalysts for growth, its agents do have freewill and use extreme cunning and technological tricks to get their way. It is easy to be misled and the price can be heavy; the consequence is not only delay in progress, but missed opportunities to be of service to others. So more knowledge is better.
Maybe you would like to know which of the unusual opportunities placed before you are genuine and which are traps, how to distinguish positive from negative. Our time in this life is limited and making the most of it requires discernment to sidestep the pitfalls.
In my wrestling with this issue of discernment, I have found it useful to divide influences into eight categories based on whether they originate from a positive or negative source, manifest within or outside us, and whether they are forms of encouragement or resistance. They are listed below together with identifying characteristics gathered from internal and external observation. You do not need to memorize these, only become aware of them.
Negative External Resistance
These are attempts by the Control System to interfere with individuals making or contemplating some positive form of progress; sometimes they are messages designed to instill fear and doubt, other times they manifest as distraction and diversion, and occasionally they are sheer outbursts of frustration manifesting through strangers. Whatever the case, negative forms of external resistance are but empty threats and optional obligations, illusions that only carry weight if you choose to buy into them. They attack your certainty more so than your strength; rather than forcefully oppose your chosen actions, such influences merely attempt to undermine



Battle of Opposites 105
your confidence in starting or continuing them. Nevertheless, such messages can be highly manipulative because they work through anyone and anything that can be influenced by the Control System, allowing for methods of deception too subtle to be discerned by the average person.
Examples of negative external resistance include: irrational criticism/ridicule of your choices, being shown examples of others who failed, multiple individuals giving you the same baseless warning around the same time delivered in the same way, harassment like evil glares and cryptic mutterings from strangers, people exploding into rage at you for no reason, electronic glitches and paranormal phenomena that serve as overly dramatic omens, and twisted synchronicities that seem smug and contrived. All of these appeal to your ignorance, fear, insecurity, shame, and self-importance.
Positive External Resistance
Rather than deceptively baiting your freewill, positive external resistance comes in the form of subtle warning signs and the outright blocking of dangerous courses of action. The warning signs are clues that guide you toward gaining an expanded perspective of the situation in order to see some hidden danger. Unlike negative resistance, these signs and synchronicities require a clear mind to figure out. Blocking of unwise actions comes in the form of delays in plans. When severe, it manifests as an increase in accidents, mechanical failures, and health problems. Positive resistance is far more persistent, all encompassing, and final than the negative type, more like a brick wall than a stop sign. Forcing your way through these results in mounting personal misfortune. Positive external resistance appeals to reason, intuition, and discernment.
Negative External Encouragement
These are deceptive opportunities and messages that appeal to your weakness, ignorance, wishful thinking, and primal desires. They are



106 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
spiritual hooks cast into this world by the Control System to reel in the weak. These hooks are baited with empty promises and artificial synchronicities, appealing to the ego (the negative parts of the lower self) or lower emotions and are sometimes reinforced by “confirmation” in the form of blatant coincidences designed to give the impression that this was all “meant to be.”
Examples of negative external encouragement: slick strangers offering you opportunities that are too good to be true, belief systems offering quick results, “reality” fulfilling your ego-based requests and “prayers,” dreams that are literal rather than symbolic and involve characters trying to talk you into something dubious, deceptive ideas pushed upon you simultaneously by multiple unrelated individuals, physically impossible anomalies and freaky synchronicities appearing during periods of mental uncertainty to sway your decisions, and oddly timed requests for participation in some form of distraction.
Positive External Encouragement
Reality aligns when one is in the flow. Confirmation in the form of genuine synchronicities and signs tend to come after the choice has already been made to pursue some positive idea or action. Another type of positive external encouragement is a serendipitous and unexpected opportunity that answers a soul-based calling or earnest need. What distinguishes positive from negative types is that positive ones appeal to reason and intuition, lifting your spirits and bringing relief; positive ones also lack the intuitive vibes of desperate baiting, plus they are not limited to working within the comparatively narrow range of what is susceptible to negative control. At its extreme, positive external encouragement works with destiny to make critical events fall into place unexpectedly and thus unavoidably, always for the better in the long run.

Negative Internal Resistance
When naturally occurring, negative internal resistance originates from habitual resistance to change and emotional addiction to old ways of being. Other natural factors include chemical, astrological, and lunar phase variables. When intentionally induced, negative internal resistance stems from a combination of artificially lowered emotions and destructive posthypnotic suggestions, which send the weak mind into a downward spiral of rationalization and reinforcement of these triggers. They may manifest as mindless nudges that closely mimic real thoughts and are therefore casually acted upon, or they may manifest as compulsions that push the mind firmly into resisting some positive action. The latter appears most commonly as procrastination or unfounded bias against beneficial ideas. Whatever the case, such influences can be discerned if you realize they suppress lucidity and emotional balance.
Examples: incessant critical self-talk, mental block or fog in regards to some constructive thought or action, feeling like you are in a numb hypnotic trance, being suddenly enveloped in a dark emotional cloud, feelings of fear and despair rationalized by dwelling upon personal insecurities, having unexplainable hostility toward a harmless idea or person, clenching sensations isolated in the chest area and designed to imitate the more subtle gut instinct, symptoms of disobeying a hypnotic command and releasing the pressure in other ways such as unexplainable fidgeting and sudden feelings of anxiety or panic that come to nothing, and positive thoughts immediately countered by discouraging or distracting thought loops.
Positive Internal Resistance
When the lower self acts contrary to higher wisdom, this shows up as inner feelings of indifference or caution toward some matter. Despite your attempts at rationalizing it away, this feeling persists and can only be drowned out by distracting yourself with lower



108 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
impulses and desires. Often it is accompanied by a faint inner voice or intuitive impression, the tone ranging from calm advice to urgent caution, but never does it manifest as spiteful criticism or threatening commands. When in the form of a gut-instinct, this feeling tends to circulate through the upper body rather than just the gut or chest area; the latter in isolation can be posthypnotically triggered to provide a false signal. Unlike negative internal resistance, positive resistance demands lucidity instead of hysteria and requires rationalization to ignore rather than to believe. As a whole, positive internal resistance is the heart and mind saying “no” in unison.
Negative Internal Encouragement
These compel you toward engaging in hasty, impulsive, harmful, or distractive behavior like making and acting upon false assumptions or pursuing sexual and material fantasies. Programmed thoughts can be reinforced by lower emotions and animal instincts to produce obsession, wishful thinking, and prejudice. Forms of negative internal encouragement range from the completely mechanical (habit, custom, hypnotic programming) to the completely emotional (hormones, ego preservation, primal instincts) but most often combine both. The subtlest types simply dress up fruitless ideas as good ones, and the most extreme types demand violent action. Any type of negative encouragement can be detected by its irrational, impatient, and desperate nature. Physical symptoms accompanying negative internal encouragement include mental and emotional muting or numbing, tightened breathing, increased heartbeat and raised blood pressure or flushing.
Positive Internal Encouragement
This lights up the heart, mind, and soul. A truly good idea will be agreeable to both reason and intuition, deepening the breath, bringing a sense of relief and inner knowing that defeats any need for impatience. Whereas the negative types of encouragement



Battle of Opposites 109
propel you into action like gravity sending one tumbling down a hill, positive encouragement puts spring in your step. It always sharpens and energizes the mind by engaging the higher aspects wonder, curiosity, creative joy, enthusiasm, and spiritual satisfaction. If active on the mental level, it will come in the form of a sudden realization. If solely on the intuitive level it will manifest as a deep and calm sense that something is a good idea—unlike negative cases where a “good idea” only seems so after enough rationalization drowns out any underlying lack of soul interest.
Discerning Between Similar Phenomena
Positive and negative are never identical, but they can be similar. The training of discernment involves increasingly challenging exercises. Whenever confronted with uncertainty, turn within and reflect upon your own experiences. Truth is found by reconciling example with counter-example, extracting insight from the paradox by searching for a bigger picture. Below are some examples of positive phenomena and similar negative counterparts.
How can you distinguish between:
1) “Losing faith in what is actually a good idea” vs. “intuition finally emerging that something was a bad idea all along”? Both begin in hope and are interrupted by discouragement, so at first these seem indistinguishable. Knowing that positive and negative are never identical, a difference must exist and here it is: while the first begins with excitement in what is and meets discouragement by “what if?”, the second begins with overconfidence in “what if?” and is eventually defeated by what is. In other words, loss of faith in a good idea happens when facts are overpowered by speculative failure scenarios and mental paralysis through insecurity and fear, while intuitive recognition of a bad idea starts with overenthusiastic fantasizing and ends in a rude awakening to the facts.



110 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
2) “Indifference due to absence of soul-interest” vs. “programming to resist and turn away”? Both involve lack of total enthusiasm for an idea or course of action. They differ as follows: the first signifies total lack of inner enthusiasm, the second drowns out enthusiasm via distracting failure scenarios and insecurity. In the first case, no inner enthusiasm can be found; in the second case, it can be found if one pays attention to it despite the noise.
3) “Good plan that meets obstacles” vs. “obstacles signifying a bad idea”? Both involve goals being hindered. The main difference is that in the first case the obstacle has no bearing on the actual validity of the idea, whereas in the second case the obstacle shows the idea is flawed and impractical. The first logically requires bypassing the obstacle, the second demands abandonment or modification of the idea.
4) “Resistance stemming from intuitively perceiving danger” vs. “being programmed to resist out of paranoia”? Both involve the impression that there is danger, but the difference comes down to awareness vs. reactivity. The first creates a sense of urgency that heightens awareness and sharpens perception, while the second skews perception by inducing physiological symptoms of fear and panic. Both may involve fear, but in the first case fear follows perception while in the second case fear precedes and molds perception.
What is written above may not be entirely universal because tests of discernment are tailored to the discerner. How much of it applies to you depends on how much you can recognize the above in your own life. The point was merely to show you the necessity of discerning positive from negative and to illustrate that it can be done.
Anything can fall down, but not everything can fly up. It takes little effort to fall into darkness but considerable effort at times to



Battle of Opposites 111
withstand the pull of this spiritual gravity and even more to rise higher. Just as weight determines how strongly something is pulled downward by gravity, so does the level of dominance held by our lower aspect determine how strongly we are affected by negative influences. These weigh us down for as long as we are chained to them via our repeated indulgence in negative reactions and thoughtless mechanical behavior. But by consistently identifying and choosing that which uplifts and originates from our higher noble aspects, the chains rust away from neglect and the possibility of flight becomes a reality.

When you get hooked researching the kinds of topics discussed in this book, you will inevitably feel the need to tell others about it. But it won’t take long before you realize that the majority of people are closed off to alternative ideas. They may argue with you, act like you’re the weirdo, or laugh in your face. Maybe one in ten will be open minded enough to have an intelligent conversation, but the rest cannot be expected to be so willing. Not everyone is ready to think outside the box, and the longer one stays in a narrow mindset the harder it becomes to escape it. Therefore older people tend to be less receptive than younger ones. The worst ones are college-educated know-it-alls who look down on anyone who holds a dissenting opinion. But you never know where people stand until you interact with them; therefore withhold judgment until their actions speak for themselves.
Good news is that some individuals are waking up, finding themselves in situations similar to your own. On the other hand, lots are also shriveling up spiritually, becoming increasingly empty and bitter. So remember that because “saving the world” requires that people save themselves, only the willing can be assisted. There is no point in getting stubbornly frustrated with the rejection and ridicule you might face from those not ready or willing to expand their minds.



114 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
The surest way to work for the betterment of mankind is to improve yourself, educate yourself, become skilled at delivering that awareness to others who are interested. It’s more about building up your potential to serve than just going out there and haphazardly trying to do good. The actual opportunities to “do something” happen when they happen—you’ll be inspired with a good idea and your situation will coincidentally be in the right state for you to carry it out. In the meantime, prepare.
Improving yourself means becoming ever more mentally stable and emotionally balanced, acquiring wisdom from observation and experience, taking great care to deal with people according to their level of understanding.
Educating yourself means learning more about what really matters, what is really going on in this world and within yourself, the hidden things that manipulate people that could be stopped if only they knew about it, and the positive principles that if known and applied would allow one to progress more intelligently and powerfully yet compassionately through life.
Becoming skilled means finding your niche for communication. Some are good at sending messages through music or art, others through writing, informal conversations, or public speaking. If you can become a walking “help center” where those you meet who need a bit of inspiration or help figuring something out may benefit from what you yourself have learned, that’s a good thing.
Whatever you do learn about, be sure to ponder and not just memorize. Look for what it explains, and look for what it fails to explain. Over time you’ll grow talented at telling truth from deception, which is a very important skill because the road to higher knowledge is strewn with lures and traps.



Helping Others 115
Networking with others of similar orientation works wonders. Ideas bounce back and forth, new ideas arise seemingly out of nowhere, one person gets an idea and another happens to have some needed skills to pull it off, and so on. So whether on the Internet or in real life (most likely both) you can optimistically pursue connecting with others, seeking them out, maybe putting yourself out there through a website or blog, in order to fish for those that would make good mutual team-mates. Subtle synchronicity guides these connections but there has to be a nonzero probability that the connection can even happen—therefore as long as you take care of the mechanics, reality takes care of the rest. Your spiritual family exists right now scattered about, it’s just a matter of timing and preparation for these to gather.
What Can Be Done
As you continue your research, there is only so much you can learn about the rampant corruption, injustice, and exploitation in this world before you start itching to “do something” about these problems. Perhaps you get frustrated that more people aren’t seeing the truth, or that those who do are not taking more action. All this reading, networking, and talking may seem like an ineffective use of time when the world appears to be burning down before our eyes and action is needed now.
It is this impatient attitude that leads to energy wasted in frustration, haste, and self-sabotage. Be wise and remember that preparation and timing are keys to effective action, and that timing is decided by factors not always under your control. Acting prematurely misses the mark just as much as procrastination.
When energy is not being released, it must be accumulated. When time is not ripe for action, make preparations for more effective action. Reading, learning, sharing, discussing, building, networking, practicing—these are all ways of accumulating the necessary energy for later release, of setting in place the tools,



116 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
skills, and infrastructure needed to make the best of what opportunities come.
Opportunities are like open doors. Forcing your way through a closed and locked door is unnecessary. Notice how the most unrewarding endeavors in life are pursued despite internal and external resistance, despite reluctance, nagging intuition, warning signs, and things simply not working out smoothly. These paths are riddled with obstacles that increase distress and make for wasted effort.
Good opportunities open as you stand before them, requiring only that you walk through the door. Notice how the most fulfilling endeavors come with internal and external assistance, accompanied by genuine enthusiasm and things naturally falling into place. Any challenges found on such paths serve to add excitement and transform effort into success. When the best opportunities manifest, you will have neither doubt nor hesitation in acting on them.
As always, there are two risks to avoid here. The first is letting impatience, wishful thinking, or dishonest motivation override your intuition and better judgment. This leads to picking the wrong door or perhaps prematurely forcing your way through the right door. The second risk is in waiting passively for a good opportunity to spring you out of chronic complacency. Let’s examine this second risk more closely.
It is true that when one is on the right path, everything falls into place naturally. But some take this as an excuse for complacency, thinking that since all manifests at its proper time all they need to do is sit and wait. What they forget is that being on the right path is meaningless if one doesn’t move along it. Like a road with exits, the right exit will come at its proper time, but parking and waiting for that exit to arrive is a contradiction.

It is in taking a previous opportunity to its conclusion that the next one manifests, but people already stuck in a rut are starting with zero momentum and must therefore jump start the process by doing something out of their own volition. It is as simple shifting focus toward something interesting or exciting and going for it.
To summarize, preparation and action are equally important, each having its proper time as determined by circumstance. The time for action is when your readiness and enthusiasm meet with opportunity. If you encounter obstacles instead of challenges, then double check the sincerity of your motivation, examine the soundness of your methods, and check whether conditions are currently ripe to receive your efforts. Lack of progress stems from using force to surmount obstacles or passively waiting for opportunity to arrive. When fear of inadequacy keeps one from taking action, remember that time spent complaining could be better put toward becoming prepared. And lastly, know that all falls into place most elegantly when one stays busy enough with some positive endeavor to keep from anticipating the next.
We are ultimately concerned with actions that enlighten and empower others by presenting them a more truthful alternative. For help to have any effect, the recipients must first become aware of the choice, make the choice, then have what it takes to follow through. It is easy to see that today’s ignorance and suffering originate with people either not being aware of the choice, being aware but not choosing it, or choosing it but not having the fortitude or discipline to put to work.
This then determines what is our responsibility and what is theirs. Our responsibility is to enlighten and empower; theirs is to choose and implement. To enlighten means to clearly present the choice; to empower means to equip those who have chosen. While



118 Fringe Knowledge for Beginners
we may advise them, we cannot force them; while we may support them, we cannot carry their weight.
Ignoring these distinctions leads to wasted energy or dysfunctional dynamics. Consider preachers or quixotic activists who attempt to impose their views on others who have already chosen otherwise, or gurus who create an unhealthy state of dependence by carrying the weight of their followers. To avoid these errant ways, you must know when to inform, when to assist, and when to back off. All this comes with experience if you learn from the results.
Stated simply, the greater your internal enthusiasm and readiness is met by external necessity and opportunity, the more likely you are acting in harmony with your higher self. The signature of such a moment:
“This must be done, I have no doubt this is the right thing to do, and I happen to be in a position to do it. My motivation comes from the heart and I am willing to answer its call.”

Final Words
Exciting times are ahead! The waves of change are upon us. Will you stick your head in the sand and be pulled under, or will you surf the fringes of these waves to freedom?
How smoothly or harshly the Shift reaches completion really depends on how successfully you and others choose to rise upward in your spiritual wisdom, balance, and understanding. The higher your soul frequency and awareness, the more you tune into a channel of experiences that are harmonious and happy; others connected to you also receive a little boost. When you lift yourself, you lift the world in an indirect but significant manner.
You were born here for a reason, and that reason will become clearer to you as life unfolds. If you pursue what really energizes your soul and gives you a complete inner feeling of fulfillment, then things will fall into place automatically. Your latent talents will be called out of you by the needs of circumstance; respond to challenges with enthusiasm and these budding talents will bloom.
Be smart when standing up for your beliefs. It is better to create the new than just attack the old. Have fun with life, keep your sense of humor, and remember to seek love, truth, and wisdom above all else. May your spirit awaken and shine!
