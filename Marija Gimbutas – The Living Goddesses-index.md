E DITOR’S PREFACE
hortly after the death of Marija Gimbutas, her daughter Živile Gimbu
tas called and asked me to finish this book, a difficult task since I
would not be able to call Dr. Gimbutas to ask her questions about con
tent, formatting, intent. She had reworked the first chapters quite a bit
more than the long and very rich final chapter, which at that time formed
the whole of part II. I began with my own edit of the text and then gave
a more careful look at both details and the final shape the book would
take. In order to make the book as up-to-date as possible, I added com
ments in notes (presented as “editor’s notes”). (The author’s own sources
are given within the text.)
Dr. Gimbutas had planned many illustrations for the second half of the
book, but these were not among the illustrations she left at the time of
her death. Thus part I, on the prehistoric era, is richly illustrated, while
part II has been left unillustrated. Illustrations of the historic-age myths
and folklore may be found in editions of Bullfinch’s Mythology and in ency
clopedias of world mythology such as that of Larousse.
Marija Gimbutas always had “one more book” in her mind. This book
was her final work in a prodigious writing career. She continued to edit
it until she was hospitalized, ten days before her death. The manuscript
manifested her love, perseverance, and hope, for she continued to work
and rework it in spite of great physical pain, using her strength to shape
it enough so that it could be finished by an editor.
This book was first envisioned as a popularized version of her earlier
work. But, in characteristic fashion, in her last year Dr. Gimbutas decided
that she must disseminate new work, and therefore she filled this new
academic work with her findings from 1991 to 1993. This work therefore
stands as a testimony to the research of the final years, months, and weeks
of her life.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
ompleting and editing the work of another is a daunting task, par
ticularly when the composition has been written by one as broadly
knowledgeable as Marija Gimbutas. Realizing that I could not complete
this work alone, I asked several women, themselves authorities in vari
ous fields, to read the manuscript after my initial work and to offer their
suggestions. I am incredibly grateful for the indispensable help of the
thealogian-theologian Carol P. Christ; Susan Gitlin-Emmer, teacher of
women’s spirituality; the Indo-European archaeologist Karlene Jones
Bley; and the lecturer-author-biographer Joan Marier, whose prior expe
rience in editing Marija’s book The Civilization o f the Goddess was invaluable.
1 also thank the Indo-European linguist Martin Huld for his willingness
to confer with me on etymologies. The historian of religion Kees Bolle
gave invaluable advice, as did the professor of Germanic mythology and
linguistics Edgar C. Polomé.
William Oldendorf worked with Professor Gimbutas on the first draft
of this book; although the work has subsequently gone through many
changes, he deserves great thanks for his efforts.
Debra Eve, who edited the first versions of this manuscript together
with Professor Gimbutas, was exceptionally devoted to the completion of
the book. She undertook the organization of the illustrations and offered
invaluable suggestions with regard to the rest of the manuscript; I offer
her my heartfelt appreciation.
Most of the illustrations were produced by James Bennett. It is likely
that others early on produced illustrations as well; unfortunately, their
names do not appear in Professor Gimbutas’ records. Further, it is quite
possible that the source lists left at the time of Professor Gimbutas’ death
do not reflect correct sources in every case. To all of the illustrators, and
sources for illustrations, I therefore extend my gratitude and my
apologies.
Carolyn Radio, director of the Joseph Campbell and Marija Gimbutas
Library at Pacifica University, kindly made Professor Gimbutas’ archives
books and notes— available to me; she also far exceeded the bounds of
duty to search through the materials in order to unearth missing illustra
tions. I thank also the Special Collections librarian Richard Buchen.

I must also thank Živile Gimbutas, who with kindness and friend
ship encouraged this completion of her mother’s work, supplying her own
time and energy as well. Marija’s daughter Rasa Julie Thies was also very
supportive.
Irene Luksis Goddard and Valentinas Varnas carefully checked citations
on Lithuanian and Latvian goddesses. Paula Coe and Angélique Guler
movich-Epstein supplied suggestions and information for the Celtic chap
ter. Many thanks to my research assistant, Jules Hart, for bibliographic
help and loving support.
I thank Susan Gray, Sandra Golvin, and Geraldine Hannon for love
and inspiration; and I give special thanks to my husband, Greg Dexter, and
to my son and daughter, Jacob and Leah Robbins, for their support and
encouragement to complete this project.
Finally, I am very grateful to the editors of the University of California
Press, Stan Holwitz, Harry Asforis, Sue Heinemann, and Bonita Hurd, who
through their encouragement and expertise were most helpful in causing
this work to come to fruition.
Because Marija Gimbutas did not live to write her own acknowledg
ments to this book, I would like to thank, in her place, several of the people
who gave encouragement and strength to her in her final months. Her
daughters, Danute, Živile, and Rasa, gave her wonderful physical and emo
tional support. Many women in the Los Angeles community regularly
visited her, including Debra Eve, Camille Ameen, Starr Goode, Susan Gitlin
Emmer, Jean Freer, Martha Wolford, Noel Lightbome, Barbara Bradshaw,
Gloria Orenstein, and Ruth Barrett. Joan Marier and Vicki Noble visited
frequently from the San Francisco Bay Area, as did Patricia Reis and James
Harrod from Maine. These people inspired Marija to “produce, produce!”
even in her last weeks— through their inspiration and their love.

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION
his book, which occupied Marija Gimbutas for the last two years
of her life, was her last work (in English) in a writing career that
included approximately three hundred scholarly articles and twenty
books, translated into many foreign languages. It is different from Marija
Gimbutas’ other works: it is exceptionally rich in folklore and myth. The
focus of the book is twofold: a synthesis of her earlier work and the addi
tion of new research. In the first several chapters, she synthesizes much
of her research on Neolithic Europe, adding information that became avail
able after her monograph, The Civilization o f the Goddess: The World o f Old
Europe, was published. (Although Gimbutas uses information dating to
the Upper Paleolithic, circa 3 0 ,0 0 0 -1 0 ,0 0 0 b.c., and the Mesolithic, circa
1 0 ,0 0 0 -7 0 0 0 b.c., she focuses her own work primarily on the Neolithic,
circa 7 0 0 0 /6 0 0 0 -3 0 0 0 b.c., and the Bronze Age, circa 2 5 0 0 -1 5 0 0 b.c. She
also discusses the historic cultures of the Iron Age, circa 1500 b.c. through
the middle of the first millennium b.c.)
Much of Marija Gimbutas’ work was grounded in her findings at the
archaeological sites she excavated, including Obre in Bosnia, Anza in Mace
donia, Sitagroi in northwestern Greece, Achilleion in southern Thessaly
(Greece), and Manfredonia in southern Italy. These excavations led directly
to three edited volumes: Neolithic Macedonia (Gimbutas 1976), on her exca
vations at Anza; Excavations at Sitagroi I (Renfrew, Gimbutas, and Elster
1986); and Achilleion: A Neolithic Settlement in Thessaly, Greece, 6400-6500
BC (Gimbutas et al. 1989).
Early in her career, Marija Gimbutas identified the “Kurgan” culture.
These Proto-Indo-Europeans were a patrilineal, patrilocal, pastoral, and
seminomadic group of peoples who, she believed, originated in the
steppes of Russia. They were militaristic, produced weapons, and rode
horses. Their religion centered upon male gods. Their agriculture was rudi
mentary, although as they came into greater contact with Old Europeans,
they domesticated more plants and developed metallurgy. The ceramic
art of these peoples was poorly developed. They buried their dead in pit
graves covered with a cairn (Kurgan I and II) or an earthen mound, or
kurgan (Kurgan III and IV).
Gimbutas traced their migrations from an area north of the Caucasus,
XV



in the Russian steppes, to their new homelands. These new homelands
encompassed the geographic areas that became Greece, Italy, Britain, Ire
land, Lithuania, Latvia, Russia, Germany, Scandinavia, Anatolia, India,
Iran, and Chinese Turkestan. There were three migrations: Wave 1, circa
4400-4200 b .c . (Kurgan I—II, the Khvalynsk and Srednij Stog cultures);
Wave 2, circa 3400-3200 b .c . (Kurgan III, the Maikop culture); and Wave
3, circa 3000-2800 b .c . (Kurgan iy the Yamna or Pit-grave culture) (for
a thorough discussion of the Wave theory, see Gimbutas 1977,1980,1985;
these three articles are included in Gimbutas 1997).
When the Proto-Indo-Europeans arrived at their new homelands, they
met groups of indigenous peoples who were relatively peaceful, agrarian,
artistically creative, probably equalitarian in social structure, and goddess
worshiping. The indigenous peoples had an advanced aesthetic: they built
two-story houses and beautiful temples, of which we have clay models. They
produced beautiful painted ceramic ware. They were sometimes assimilated,
sometimes destroyed, by the Kurgan peoples, whose domestication of the
horse and military ability gave them a strong advantage. The Proto-Indo
Europeans imposed both language and religion on the indigenous peoples,
although traces of both indigenous language and religion remained as a sub
stratum in the resulting “Indo-European”language and culture. Thus, “Indo
European”is a result of the merging of Kurgan peoples with Old Europeans.
In order to trace the Indo-Europeans, Gimbutas made use of compar
ative linguistics and mythology, as well as archaeology. The French
mythologist Georges Dumézil had found parallels between Indo-European
religious pantheons and social structure, formulating a “Tripartite” theory.
According to his theory, the Indo-Europeans were divided into three social
groups or “functions”: priests (“first function”), warriors and nobility (“sec
ond function”), and “caretakers”— farmers, laborers, and craftspeople
(“third function”). Gimbutas found sharp contrasts between the hierar
chical Indo-Europeans and the equalitarian Old Europeans. Although
throughout much of her early career she elaborated on the Kurgan peo
ples, in her last twenty years she became more and more interested in the
peoples whom they assimilated: the Old Europeans. The refinement of
her opinions about the Old Europeans may be traced from her 1974 Gods
and Goddesses o f Old Europe (reprinted in 1982 in updated form as The
Goddesses and Gods o f Old Europe), through her 1989 Language o f the God
dess and her 1991 The Civilization o f the Goddess: The World o f Old Europe.
In this, her final book, her thoughts have come to fruition: here we may
read her final thoughts about Old Europeans and Indo-Europeans.
In the first chapter of this book, Gimbutas looks at images of goddesses
and gods, including images of the bird and snake goddesses and other
xvi / Editor’s Introduction



deities in the form of animals. Here she also discusses deified images of
life and death. It is believed that the Old Europeans worshiped the full
circle of birth, death, and rebirth in the form of a “great”-goddess. Unlike
the early historical cultures, most of which venerated the givers of life (for
example, the Greek Aphrodite), while dishonoring those who brought
death (for example, the Greek Gorgon, Medusa), the Old Europeans did
not divide the great-goddess into fragments of “good” and “bad.” The god
dess was one and many, a unity and a multiplicity. The hybrid bird-and
snake goddess was the great-goddess of the life continuum, the goddess
of birth, death, and rebirth; she was the creator and the destroyer, the
maiden, the crone, and the goddess in the prime of life who mated with
the young god in the hieros gamos, the “sacred marriage,” and gave birth
again and again-— to creation.
In chapter 2 Gimbutas discusses another subject dear to her heart, Old
European sacred script. Although translatable written language did not
appear until the advent of Sumerian cuneiform writing and Egyptian hiero
glyphics, both around the beginning of the third millennium b .c ., signs
dating to the Old European Neolithic, and even earlier to the Upper Pale
olithic, have been recovered, carved on various objects, such as figurines
and bowls. Excellent examples of Old European script are to be found on
figurines from the Vinca culture, in the northwest Balkans.
In chapter 3 Gimbutas discusses the concept of the life cycle in graphic
form, explaining that the tomb is also the sacred place from which new
life emanates. The tomb is the womb of the goddess; the two are, in Old
European religion, inextricably interconnected. There are examples in
iconography showing this interconnectedness. For example, a marble preg
nant figure was found in a Cycladic grave (British Museum No. GR
1 9 3 2 -1 0 .1 8 1 , dating to 2 8 0 0 -2 3 0 0 b .c .). The provenance of the tomb
indicates that the figure represented a death goddess, but the goddess of
death was teeming with new life. Many tombs, as well as shrines cele
brating rituals of death and regeneration, have ritual shapes: in Lepenski
Vir, a site on the Danube River in the Iron Gates region, Gimbutas found
small triangular-shaped structures containing statues and altars, which were
associated with burials; caves such as Scaloria cave in southeast Italy con
tained evidence of ritual: pottery sherds with regenerative designs, and
skeletons of mostly young women and children. The rock-cut tombs of
Malta are egg-shaped, while the Maltese Hypogeum, an underground tem
ple, consists of thirty-four interconnected egg-shaped chambers; approx
imately seven thousand human bones were found there, mostly in
egg-shaped niches in the lower chambers. In Sardinia as well, tombs con
sisted of rock-cut egg- or kidney-shaped chambers. Megalithic monuments,
which served as places of both ritual and burial, flourished throughout
xvii / Editor’s Introduction



western Europe. Many of these monuments were anthropomorphic in
shape, representing the full figure of the goddess. Many, such as New
grange and Knowth in Ireland and the Maltese Hypogeum, were deco
rated with regenerative symbols such as the spiral and the coiled snake.
These tombs, shaped like the goddess of death and regeneration, were the
womb of the goddess.
In her long career, Marija Gimbutas excavated many temples— gener
ally these were found within a community, an integral part of it. In these
temples or “house shrines,”the hearth was often central, and home-related
tasks such as baking were aligned with the sacred. In chapter 4, she dis
cusses actual temples, such as the stone temples on the Mediterranean
islands of Malta and neighboring Gozo, as well as clay models of temples
and other ritual equipment (more than one hundred temple models have
been excavated, from much of southeastern and eastern Europe, from the
Balkans to Ukraine). Some of the real temples seem to be dedicated to a
bird goddess, to a snake goddess, or to a pregnant goddess of vegetation.
The houselike temples of southeast Europe contained altars, statues
(some life-sized), figurines (many bearing markings that indicate cloth
ing, headgear, and medallions), miniature furnishings, incense burners,
and human- or animal-shaped vases. They also contained the technology
of everyday life: domed ovens, grinding stones, storage jars. That they con
tained looms may be inferred from ceramic loom weights and spindle
whorls (the wooden looms were destroyed by time). Gimbutas believed
that the Old Europeans wove cloth, baked bread, and created pottery as
sacred acts: that the ancient temples were centers of a holistic spiritual
life.
Not all Old European temples were built structures. Chapter 5 exam
ines roundels (round enclosures), square enclosures, and causewayed
enclosures: sacred outdoor precincts built of wood and stone and often
surrounded by ceremonial ditches. In Britain, roundels such as the famous
Stonehenge, Woodhenge, and Avebury in County Wiltshire date from the
third millennium b .c . Earlier roundels (from circa 5 0 0 0 -3 0 0 0 b .c .), per
haps less well known, were built by the Lengyel and other cultures of cen
tral Europe. These structures served religious, not military, purposes, since
the artifacts found within them, including human skeletons (buried along
with ritual objects), animal bones, vases, and figurines, indicate feasting
and ritual burial. The enclosures usually opened to the four cardinal direc
tions, and they probably served seasonal rituals. They reflect cooperative
work, and they served the collective community.
In chapter 6 Gimbutas discusses matrilineal inheritance, stating her
belief that the peoples of Old Europe handed down their goods through
xviii / Editor’s Introduction



the female line. In matrilineal societies, women are economically viable
since they are able to inherit goods. This leads to greater female auton
omy and greater respect for the female. Gimbutas relates social respect
for the female to religious respect for the female— the worshiping of
goddesses— and states that Old European matrilineal societies therefore
honored both mortal females and female deities. Consequently, in her
opinion these cultures were equalitarian in social structure, honoring both
women and men.
Whereas part I considers the prehistoric goddesses and gods and pre
historic religion, part II discusses the “living” goddesses, deities who were
worshiped in the early historic eras, some of which have continued to be
venerated through the modem era. In the chapters of this section, Gimbu
tas examines the myths of several cultures, both Indo-European and non
Indo-European. She begins with southern Europe, where most of her own
excavations took place. She discusses pre-Indo-European Minoan religion
and then Greek religion: both its Indo-European Greek and its Old Euro
pean pre-Greek components. She then examines the goddesses of the
Etruscans and the Basques, two cultures that, although surrounded by Indo
Europeans, retained their non-Indo-European languages and character.
Finally, she discusses the religions of northern and central Europe: those
of the Celts, the Germanic peoples, and the Balts. She concludes the book
with a rich discourse on the gods, goddesses, fairies, witches, and sprites
of Baltic religion. Particularly in this section, Marija Gimbutas drew upon
her memory, with the intention of writing down the sources later. I have
attempted to add source explications wherever possible.
Marija Gimbutas’ work was quite controversial, for she was an origi
nal thinker and strong in asserting her hypotheses. As a result, she had
both strong proponents and strong opponents. She was a voracious reader
as well, and her ideas were presented with a clear knowledge of the data
and of the hypotheses of others. A dynamic scholar, she never shirked
from criticism or from taking a chance. She realized the importance of
interpreting findings as well as presenting them, affording us hypotheses
to prove or disprove, as well as foundations of facts upon which to build
our own theories. She realized that the interpretation and interconnection
of data are what lead to understanding and to a deep scientific contribution.
In this book, Marija Gimbutas has made yet another rich contribution
to the study of folklore and mythology and to the exciting interdiscipli
nary field of archaeomythology. She brings much new material to the
book— for example, showing us a “Medusa” head that dates to the sixth
millennium b.c., thus pushing back to the early Neolithic era this “death”
aspect of the Old European goddesses. Her contributions to the field of
xix / Editor’s Introduction



archaeomythology are great, for she has provided the mythologist with the
physical data— statues, figurines, statistics of chronology, and provenance
that give us knowledge of prehistoric religion. No less significant is her
own love for the figures of folklore and myth, her own passion for the sub
ject. It is this inextricable union of passion and knowledge that is Marija
Gimbutas’ legacy to us.
xx / Editor’s Introduction



PART I
Religion in Prepatriarchal Europe



C H A P T E R ONE
Images of Goddesses and Gods
I
n Neolithic Europe and Asia Minor (ancient Anatolia)— in the era
between 7000 b .c . and 3000 b .c .— religion focused on the wheel of life
and its cyclical turning. This is the geographic sphere and the time frame
I refer to as Old Europe. In Old Europe, the focus of religion encompassed
birth, nurturing, growth, death, and regeneration, as well as crop culti
vation and the raising of animals. The people of this era pondered un
tamed natural forces, as well as wild plant and animal cycles, and they
worshiped goddesses, or a goddess, in many forms. The goddess mani
fested her countless forms during various cyclical phases to ensure that
they functioned smoothly. She revealed herself in multiple ways through
the myriad facets of life, and she is depicted in a very complex symbolism.
First I will explore these forms in detail, looking mainly at goddess fig
ures, and then I will unravel their meaning. The images of the goddess
can be loosely categorized under her aspects of life giving and sustaining,
death, and renewal. Although male energy also motivated regeneration
and life stimulation, in both the plant and animal worlds, it was the fem
inine force that pervaded existence.
Figurines
Small statues, excavated from Old European settlements, cemeteries, and
tombs, comprise an important source for understanding Old European
religion. When the Old Europeans discovered how to fire pottery in about
the seventh millennium b .c ., that pottery provided a new way to express
religious ideals. A variety of ceramic forms— vases, figurines, and ritual
implements— displayed the spiritual symbols of Old Europe. Although
Old European cultures continued to create religious artifacts in other
3



media— stone, bone, amber, and antler— it was ceramic forms that most
richly manifested the symbolic world of Old Europe. By nature, archaeological preservation favors smaller artifacts. Chances
are better for a ceramic sculpture a few inches high to survive seven or
more millennia under several feet of dirt than for a life-size ceramic statue.
Consequently, we often unearth small images intact and larger statues in
many parts. Most of these figurines can be held in one’s hand. Their mak
ers often etched them with sacred symbols in the form of facial markings,
geometric designs, and signs that may have been a form of script.
Our Neolithic ancestors not only created figurines representing cer
tain deities, priestesses, or other mythical persona; they also reenacted rit
uals with these figurines. Discoveries include not only female and male
figurines, which may have been made to represent goddesses and gods,
but also thrones, vases, offering tables, furniture, musical instruments, and
even miniature temples. Such miniature temples preserve the prototypes,
adding an extra dimension to the archaeological record. Although ancient
peoples created religious artifacts in other media (woven cloth and wood,
for instance), except in extraordinary cases these have decayed. As a result,
small ceramic objects provide some of the most important evidence for
deciphering Old European religion.
Almost all archaeological sites in Italy, the Balkans, and central Europe
contain these objects, spanning almost every Neolithic time period. We
also find them in Asia Minor (ancient Anatolia, modem Turkey), the Near
East, and to a much lesser extent, in western and northern Europe. Often
where sites reach several meters deep, representing centuries or even mil
lennia of occupation, figurines occur at almost every level. In these sig
nificant sites, we can often discern an artistic evolution from the earliest
levels to the latest ones, indicating the importance of these objects to gen
eration after generation of inhabitants.
The Neolithic, or earliest agricultural era, provides a much more fer
tile source for deciphering figurines than the previous archaeological peri
ods, the Mesolithic and the Upper (or later) Paleolithic. The artifacts from
this earlier time period often lose their contexts, and for the entire Upper
Paleolithic, we have only about three thousand figurines. For Old Europe,
with its great outpouring of religious art, so many figurines have been exca
vated at so many sites that we cannot possibly tabulate them accurately.
Total Old European figurines may number one hundred thousand or more,
counting all the broken or damaged figurines deemed unimportant in ear
lier excavations. Fortunately, settlements, cemeteries, and tombs, which
provide excellent contexts, constitute the bulk of Neolithic sites. The innu
merable Neolithic figurines preserved in their original settings intimate
the richness of Old European spirituality.

SYMBOLIC SIGNIFICANCE OF THE HUMAN BODY
The human body constituted one of Old Europe’s most powerful sym
bols. As a result of modem cultural programming, we often associate naked
ness with sexual enticement. The modern analyst naturally projects these
attitudes back thousands of years and assumes that ancient depictions of
the body served basically the same purpose.
Our cultural programming also leads to the assumption that female
representations invariably represent “earth as fertility”; therefore all naked
female artifacts become “fertility figurines.” The Old European cultures
certainly cared about fertility. But, as we will see, the wide variety of fig
urines, and particularly their Neolithic archaeological contexts, suggests
that the feminine force played a wider religious role.1 The many sophis
ticated Neolithic art forms accentuating the female body unveil a natural
and sacred sexuality neglected by modern culture.
In religious art, the human body symbolizes myriad functions beyond
the sexual, especially the procreative, nurturing, and life enhancing. I
believe that in earlier times, obscenity as a concept surrounding either the
male or female body did not exist. Renditions of the body expressed other
functions, specifically the nourishing and procreative aspects of the female
body and the life-stimulating qualities of the male body. The female force,
as the pregnant vegetation goddess, intimately embodied the earth’s fer
tility. But the sophisticated, complex art surrounding the Neolithic god
dess is a shifting kaleidoscope of meaning: she personified every phase of
life, death, and regeneration. She was the Creator from whom all life
human, plant, and animal— arose, and to whom everything returned. Her
role extended far beyond eroticism.
The fact that these female figurines do not typically resemble an actual
human or animal body belies their use as mere erotic art. The body is almost
always abstracted or exaggerated in some manner. These modifications
are not accidental: a brief survey of Neolithic art shows that the highly
skilled ceramic workers of this time could achieve whatever effect they
wished. Their intentional modifications of the human body expressed var
ious manifestations of the inmost divine force. Before discussing the types
of divinities represented by the figurines, it is necessary to focus on sev
eral peculiarities of figurine art: schematization, masks, hieroglyphs, and
exaggeration of certain body parts, all of which were conventions used by
the Old European artist.
SCHEMATIC FORMS
In Old Europe, schematic female and male bodies, in conjunction with
other symbols, often represented the sacred force. Although many figurines

are ceramic masterpieces, other figurines appear strangely unfinished,
sometimes resembling nothing more than a single clay cylinder with exag
gerated breasts or buttocks, or a pregnant belly without arms or legs (Fig.
1). Their makers often incised them with symbols, such as two or three
lines, spirals or meanders, a chevron or a lozenge. These geometric sym
bols may have stimulated or identified certain functions of the divinity.
In fact, I believe that these schematic renderings distinctively focused atten
tion on the symbolic message they conveyed.
Schematic figurines comprise one of the most captivating and intrigu
ing aspects of Old European art. Although realistic, beautiful likenesses
attract more attention, many more schematic figurines are excavated than
lifelike ones. This should not surprise us, because prehistoric art was sym
bolic art. Old European artisans could create schematic figurines easily,
and, like the Christian cross, in religious practice these figures commu
nicated the same symbolic concepts as the more representational art. These
simplified images do not disparage the human body, as has been com
monly thought; instead, they express a sacred message.
E XA GGE R AT E D BODY PARTS
To express different sacred functions, figurines and other ceramic art often
display unusual modifications or exaggerations. Female figurines, repre
senting the complex feminine force, particularly show such enhancements.
Some figurines show exaggerated body weight, and they have been inter
preted by some as obese figures or “fat ladies.” Undoubtedly, this exag
gerated body weight is valued, since it appears on female figurines from
several different cultures. Other figurines focus on the generative organs,
the breasts and vulva, as well as the buttocks. Such emphasis enhances
the power of that particular part of the body. For instance, many figurines
and vases prominently display breasts. The tradition of emphasizing breasts
actually began much earlier, during the Upper Paleolithic, and continued
much later, into the Bronze Age. Breasts symbolize the nurturing and regen

Osijek, Serbia).
eration of life. The depiction of breasts on ceramic vessels used in rituals
clearly shows the female body, and by extension the body of the divine
female, as a vessel of nourishment or renewal. Although breasts obviously
embody nourishment and life sustenance, their portrayal on megalithic
tomb walls also attests to the comprehensive spiritual role of the Old Euro
pean goddess in death and the regeneration of life.
On many figurines, the breasts and the upper part of the body appear
relatively thin and de-emphasized, while the lower parts— the buttocks,
thighs, and legs— are enlarged beyond natural proportion (Fig. 2). The
figurine’s center of gravity, and its religious significance, rests in the lower
part of the body. These figurines often display exaggerated vulvas and but
tocks. Although we almost automatically think of the vulva and buttocks
as sexual symbols, in Old European art they most likely signified life giv
ing and sustenance, rather than eroticism. The symbolic value of exag
gerated buttocks relates to breasts and double eggs, where the power of
the life-giving symbol increases by doubling. Sometimes the artisan
molded the buttocks of a figurine on egg-shaped clay cores or pebbles;
thus she or he may have felt the interconnectedness of the symbols of but
tocks and eggs. This symbolism was inherited from the Upper Paleolithic:
on rocks dating to the Magdalenian period, in southern France (La Roche,
Lalinde) and southern Germany (Gonnersdorf), artisans engraved but
tocks in silhouette and marked them with one, two, or more lines. The
early Neolithic figurines with egg-shaped buttocks often exhibit two lines
as well, perhaps illustrating the state where one human being becomes two, in pregnancy.

Figure 3. Interest centers on the vulva of this terra-cotta figurine, which isflanked by semicircles and surrounded by spirals and meanders. Lines
across her waist and thighs delineate the body section that
contains these engraved sym bols. The artisan carved V signs over h er breasts and a possible script sign below them. Vinca
culture; c. 5 0 0 0 B.c. (Slatino, western Bulgaria).
In both Upper Paleolithic and Neolithic art, the vulva dominates sym
bolic portrayals, appearing separately or greatly enlarged on figurines and
pottery vessels. The vulva appears as a triangle, an oval, an open circle,
or even as a bud or branch— a fact that emphasizes its life-giving, rather
than erotic, role. The frequency and longevity of this symbol in the archae
ological record (over thirty thousand years) speaks for its essential role
in the belief system. Three large rock-carved female figures from Angles
sur-VAnglin (Vienne), in southern France (dated circa 1 7 ,0 0 0 -1 4 ,0 0 0 b .c .),
exhibit neither heads, breasts, arms, nor feet, but their vulvas are displayed
prominently Giedion (1962, 178) comments on the L’Anglin frieze, say
ing, “Had there been a need to represent the entire body, it could easily
have been done in the space available. But apparently no such need was
felt, and so only the abdomen, the pelvic area, and the vulva have been
carved. The entire figure was not important, but only the fragment which
stood for the whole.” We can easily understand why the vulva figured
so prominently among the script and symbolic messages encoded by
artisans on figurines. On one figurine dating to about 5000 b .c ., semi
circles enhance the oval vulva, while a meander and spirals decorate the
thighs and buttocks (Fig. 3). This symbolic combination conveys dyna
mism: growing, flowing, and turning. As in other symbolism, the femi
nine force is active and life producing. The goddess embodied the mystery
of new life.

MASKS
The faces of both male and female figurines display a peculiar shape: some
show severely angular jawbones, while others look perfectly oval. This
feature, combined with stylized eyes and other facial features, gives these
figurines an otherworldly appearance (Figs. 4 and 5; see also Figs. 1 3 ,1 4 ,
24, 28, below). Closer scrutiny reveals that these peculiar “facial features”
represent masks. For many decades, archaeologists have failed to recog
nize masks on figurines, even those with a distinct demarcation between
the face and the edge of the mask. In fact, at the Achilleion site in north
ern Greece (which dates from 6400 b .c . to 5600 b .c .), we found pregnant
goddess figurines with detachable masks on rod-shaped necks. In excep
tional cases, figurines hold a mask instead of wearing it (Fig. 6). In con
temporary cultures that still use masks in ritual, the masks serve to personify
a supernatural force. The ancient Greeks employed masks in drama and
in ritual for the same function: to embody the deities, as well as heroines
and heroes. Masks most likely had a similar purpose during the European
Neolithic. In fact, the masks of the Greeks undoubtedly descended from Neolithic times.
The Neolithic Old Europeans used actual life-sized masks in rituals and
ceremonies. They probably created some masks from wood, so we have
lost them to decay. But life-sized masks of ceramic and metal have been
discovered from the Vinca culture and in the Varna cemetery of Bulgaria.
Archaeologists have uncovered masks from Neolithic sites in the Near East,
such as the Nahal Hemar cave in the Judaean desert of Israel.2 The fig
urines of Old Europe may represent ritual participants wearing masks, or
an actual deity. Some masked figurines lack specific features, but others
retain intricate details that reveal which aspect of the goddess the figurine
embodies.

Although Old European artists often used masks to indicate special
aspects of the female divine, figurines sometimes directly assimilated ani
mal characteristics. Figurines with animal-shaped heads occur frequently.
Snake-, bird-, pig-, and bear-headed figurines have all been discovered.
All of these manifestations, whether masked or not, represent the inti
mate relationship among humankind, nature, and the divine during the
Neolithic. By studying markings on the masks and figurines, we can discern how
the divine manifested through different animals. These masks represent

the goddess’ sacred animals, and when worn by a human figure they
embody a fusion of animal and human forces. Figurines take on bird beaks,
snake eyes, ram horns, or bear or pig snouts. Sometimes figurines with
animal bodies wear human masks (see Fig. 24, below). Deer, fish, elk,
snakes, bears, frogs, rams, pigs, dogs, boars, hedgehogs, and waterbirds
(to name a few) all played important parts in religious symbolism.
Life-Giving and Life-Sustaining Images
LIFE-GI VI NG IMAGES
The Birth-Giving Goddess
Figurines depicting birth eloquently attest to the goddess’ most obvi
ous role as life giver. Neolithic artisans rendered her seated or semireclining
in the birth-giving position, with knees bent and legs raised, sometimes
with a hand behind her head. Her vulva may swell in parturition, the phys
iologic state just before birth. The presence of masks and symbolic mark
ings on many of these birth-giving figurines affirms their spiritual nature
and the attempt of the artisan to communicate with the goddess. The birth
goddess appears for more than twenty thousand years, from the Upper
Paleolithic through the Neolithic. She may appear in threes, often as three
Fates, in early historical religions: the Germanic Noms, the Greek Moirai,
and the Roman Parcae are all threefold goddesses of fate.
Birth was sacred— in fact, it was probably one of the most sacrosanct
events in Neolithic religion. In the early Neolithic, peoples constructed
special rooms where birth took place. We may conceive of these rooms
as birthing shrines. At Qatal Huyuk, in south central Turkey (ancient Ana
tolia), excavations revealed a room where inhabitants apparently performed
rituals connected with birthing. They painted the room red, reminding
us that red, the color of blood, was the color of life. Stylized figures on
the walls illustrate women giving birth, while circular forms and wavy lines
painted nearby may symbolize the cervix, umbilical cord, and amniotic
fluid. A low plaster platform could have been used for actual birthing.
The color and symbolism in the room suggest that people regarded birth
as a religious event, and that they accompanied it with ritual. On the island
of Malta in the central Mediterranean, the Tarxien and Mnajdra temple
artifacts indicate similar practices; these artifacts include a model of a low
couch that could have served birth giving, and a birth-giving figurine with
nine lines across her back.
The connection between moisture, life, and the life-giving goddess con
tained deep cosmological significance. Human life began in the watery
realm of a woman’s womb. So, by analogy, the goddess was the source of
11 / Images of Goddesses and Gods



all human, plant, and animal life. She ruled all water sources: lakes, rivers,
springs, wells, and rain clouds.
The fact that the goddess birthed new life into existence explains the
water symbols, such as nets, streams, and parallel lines, on many of her
images. New life springs from the mysterious watery realm, analogous to
the womb’s amniotic fluid. Net symbolism, which continues from the
Neolithic through the historic ages,3 seems to be specifically associated
with this mystical life-bringing fluid. This net symbol occurs repeatedly
through time in squares, ovals, circles, lozenges, bladder forms, triangles
(pubic triangles), and bands on figurines and vases, often in association
with snakes, bears, frogs, fish, bulls’ heads, and rams’ heads.
Even in historical times, people have considered wells, springs, and
ponds to be sacred places of healing inhabited by female spirits. Many
early Christian pilgrims visited springs whose patron saint was female (usu
ally the Virgin Mary or, in Ireland, Saint Brigit).4
The birth-giving goddess survived in classical Greek religion as Artemis
Eileithyia, and in pan-European folklore as one of three goddesses or Fates.
Latvians and Lithuanians celebrated birth in saunas up to the twentieth
century. They propitiated Laima, the birth-giving goddess, the spinner and
weaver of human life, with offerings that included a hen, or towels and
other woven materials. We shall return to this amazingly tenacious god
dess in the last chapter.
Mother and Child
The mother and child sculptural tradition so venerated during Chris
tian times actually began millennia ago, and Neolithic art provides numer
ous examples. Just as their historical equivalents, the figurines show a
mother nursing or holding her child, but the representations are distinctly
Neolithic. The mother and child have human bodies, but both may assume
animal masks that show communication with, or embodiment of, the
divine. Some of the most touching Old European figurines show a mother
tenderly embracing or nursing her child. Sometimes both mother and child
wear bear masks. In addition, several bear-headed figurines display
pouches on their backs, perhaps for carrying a baby.
The Bear and Deer
The bear and deer consistently appear with the birth-giving goddess.
She often incarnated in these forms to assist with the birthing and nurs
ing of the young. Ancient Greeks considered these two animals as incar
nations of Artemis,5 and other European folktales with deep prehistoric
roots also connect the bear, deer, and birth-giving goddess.
The bear’s history as the cosmic nurturer extends back into the Upper
12 / Images of Goddesses and Gods

Paleolithic, when people must have observed her annual pattern of hiber
nation and reawakening.6 The bear was the perfect symbol of death and
regeneration: when she hibernated she metaphorically entered the realm
of death, and when she emerged from the cave, she was metaphorically
reborn. Of course, other animals hibernate, but the bear evoked particu
larly powerful symbolism. She not only emerged from the cave alive, she
brought forth another new life: the cub bom and nursed during the win
ter, when it was assumed that the bear was in a deathlike sleep. Conse
quently, the bear, in thus representing the course of birth, death, and rebirth,
would come to be connected with the goddess associated with childbirth.
The numerous bear motifs used in creating exquisite lamps, vases, fig
urines, and offering containers reveal the ritual importance of the bear
goddess. Bear-shaped lamps are characteristic of the sixth millennium b .c .
(Fig. 7), and bear-legged, ring-handled vessels probably used for offer
ings of sacred water are also found. As already noted, the bear’s likeness
often adorned mother/child representations, confirming her mystical
maternal role.
The deer or elk was also sacred to the birth-giving goddess. The deer’s
symbolic tradition equals that of the bear, extending far back into the Upper
Paleolithic. (Archaeologists found deer remains dated at circa 14,000 b .c .
in ritual pits at the El Juyo and Tito Bustillo cave sites in Spain.) The life
renewing aspects of the deer’s antlers held great symbolic power because
they appeared seasonally during spring. Archaeologists often find deer
antlers, shoulder blades, and teeth in Neolithic burials. There exist exqui
site vases, dating to the Neolithic, shaped like deer or with deer portrayed
13 / Images of Goddesses and Gods



in relief. During the Neolithic, these vases were undoubtedly employed
in rituals. Prehistoric and early historic paintings, mosaics, and tiles iden
tified deer with wells, freshwater streams, and the water of life. Even today,
northern Asiatic and European mythologies regard the pregnant doe as a
mystical life-giver.
LIFE-SUSTAINING IMAGES
Birds and the Bird Goddess
Birds overshadow the numerous animals that repeatedly occur in
Neolithic art. Many mythologies worldwide recount how the world orig
inated from an egg, and certainly as a life source the bird’s egg conveyed
strong symbolic meaning. Bird eggs also provided extra nourishment, both
during the Neolithic and earlier. The mysterious seasonal disappearance
and reappearance of migrating birds and their enigmatic appearance from
an egg, source of both new life and nourishment, probably contributed
to their veneration.7 Birds embodied health, fertility, and good fortune
all important to life sustenance.
Most bird goddess figurines combine the human female form with a
specific species of bird: waterbirds (ducks, geese, cranes, herons); spring
birds (cuckoos); or birds of prey (crows, owls, vultures). Waterbirds appear
most often as figurines and vases. These birds inhabited both terrestrial
rivers and lakes and the celestial environment, where rain originates. They
provided a link between earthly life and beyond. Their appearance on rit
ual vessels connotes the life-giving power of liquids poured as libation
offerings. To this day in European folklore, waterbirds such as swans and
ducks bring good fortune or increase material goods.
The bird goddess often is represented as a figurine with a beaked or
duck-billed mask and the body of a human female. When she lacks a mask,
her face displays a beak-shaped nose. In the absence of a discemibly avian
face, bird goddess figurines take on a hunched posture. Their stumpy, wing
shaped arms and exaggerated buttocks suggest the body of a bird. Small
holes in the shoulders and masks of figurines may have been used to attach
bird feathers, a practice recorded through modem folk custom. In Bronze
Age and later representations, artisans portrayed ducks as ships or showed
them pulling vehicles bearing the goddess. Whether masked or not, bird
goddess figurines exhibit her symbols: chevrons, tri-lines, meanders, and
streams.
Snakes and the Snake Goddess
Snakes dwell both in water and in the ground. They hibernate in the
earth’s body during the winter, and they return in spring. Further, their

periodic molting reinforced their role as symbols of renewal. Snakes were
thus thought to bring life in spring. They were also thought to embody
deceased ancestors.
The classic image of the snake goddess portrays her sitting yogi-like
or squatting, with snake-shaped limbs (Fig. 8). Her head appears either
human, snake-like, or masked and perhaps crowned. Snake heads appear
with round eyes and a long mouth on vase rims or handles. Homed snake
heads were composed in relief on vases. As with the bird goddess, people
associated specific symbols with the snake goddess: the snake coil, spi
ral, zigzag, or wavy lines, imitating the snake’s movement. Other symbols
resembled dotted or diamond bands, imitating the snake’s skin. A snake
coil often occupies the central position on painted or engraved dishes,
votive tablets, or megalithic tombs. Snakes crawl or zigzag up vase sides
or handles from the Neolithic, through the Bronze Age, and beyond.
Vegetation Goddesses and Gods
THE PREGNANT VEGETATION GODDESS
The annual cycle of germination, growth, and harvest held both mystery
and material sustenance for early farmers. These ancient agriculturalists
must have recognized the analogy between grain seeds germinating in the
field and new life growing in the womb, for the representation of this anal
ogy is found in many Old European sites. The pregnant vegetation god
dess (she is popularly known as the earth goddess or Mother Earth) was
one of the most-represented female figures depicted in Neolithic Old
Europe. Hundreds of pregnant goddess figurines have been unearthed from
Old European settlement excavations.
Many Old European cultures connected this goddess with food, espe
15 / Images of Goddesses and Gods



daily grain and bread. Archaeologists often find pregnant goddess figurines
near bread ovens. At Achilleion in southern Thessaly, Greece, my colleagues
and I found altars and special stone platforms with offering pits near ovens,
perhaps associated with harvest rituals. The association of this goddess
with the pig also reinforces her connection with grain and the earth. The
pig fattens quickly and so provides an obvious analogy to the ripening
crops and fruits. Archaeologists have excavated large and small figurines
and vases portraying pigs, along with exquisite human-sized ceramic pig
masks. The Old Europeans may have used these masks in rituals dedi
cated to the pregnant vegetation goddess.
Farmers throughout prehistory and history recognized cyclical time,
since they knew the annual cycle of planting, growth, and harvest. They
observed festivals and rituals at appropriate times during the cycle. The
pregnant vegetation goddess, who was intimately linked with this cycle,
underwent her own changes as the year progressed. Figurines of this god
dess, dating to the Neolithic, often show her as hugely pregnant. Later,
for example in ancient Greece, this figure is represented in dual form, very
likely depicting mother-daughter pairs, the spring-summer and fall-win
ter aspects of the goddess. The pregnant one can look young and fertile
when juxtaposed next to her older, dying aspect, portrayed as a sorrow
ful crone.
The early Cucuteni (Tripolye) culture, which dated from circa
4 8 0 0 -3 5 0 0 b .c ., provides us with the clearest insight into Neolithic ritu
als honoring the pregnant vegetation goddess. At the Luka-Vrublevetskaya
site on the upper Dniester River, broken pig figurines showed traces of
grain, and some sixty figurines bore evidence of grain impressions on their
surface (Bibikov 1953; some are illustrated in Gimbutas 1974, Fig. 165).
When technicians x-rayed these very porous clay figurines, they found
three grain types (wheat, barley, and millet) stuffed inside. The excavator,
Bibikov, observed that the potter had tempered the clay figurines with
roughly ground flour and had tossed them into the fire immediately after
their manufacture, when the clay was still wet. Here we have powerful
evidence for a ritual associating grain, flour, and baking with the goddess,
performed in order to assure abundant bread.
Even after Old European culture disintegrated and Indo-European social
and religious systems took hold, European agriculturalists tenaciously ven
erated this goddess. The agrarian festivals practiced in Greece and Rome
continued traditions inherited from the Neolithic. Classical authors left
us numerous descriptions of sowing, ripening, and harvest festivals that
exude archaic ambiance. These narratives illuminate the phenomenal role
of the pregnant vegetation goddess from prehistory to the present; they
will be explored further in chapter 7.

THE VEGETATION YEAR GOD
As a divine metaphor for the cyclic growth and decay of the plant world,
a male deity was worshiped as consort of the pregnant vegetation god
dess. The male year god of vegetation takes on several forms that mirror
the changing seasons. Thus the male force complements the female.
As a young man, the year god embodies the strength and virility needed
to revive the world from winter’s deep sleep. He apparently helped
awaken the sleeping earth goddess. The Sesklo culture of Thessaly and
the succeeding Dimini culture both made images reflecting the strong and
virile aspect of the year god, portraying him nude and aroused.8 In matu
rity, the year god embodied the harvest, as shown by the presence of a
sickle or crook across his shoulder or attached to his belt. In wintry old
age, the sorrowful year god ponders the end of his cycle. From around
6000 b .c . onward, this god appears seated on a stool or throne with his
hands on his knees or supporting his chin. The Sesklo culture created many
likenesses of the aging year god, dating from around 6 0 0 0 -5 5 0 0 b .c . Just
as the pregnant vegetation goddess, the year god of vegetation endured
in folklore and mythology, especially in his declining and sorrowful state.
The pairing of male and female harvest deities thus goes back to the
European Neolithic. The elderly female and male sculptures found in one
Cernavoda grave dating from circa 47 0 0 b .c . (representing the Hamangia
17 / Images of Goddesses and Gods



culture of Romania, near the Black Sea) very likely portray such a pair.
Other possible divine vegetation pairs, dating from the same period, come
from the Szegvar-Tuzkoves site of the Tisza culture (Fig. 9). This com
plementary relationship provides sharp contrast to the dominating role
male deities played in later European religions.
THE SACRED MARRIAGE
Rituals uniting the sacred male and female forces may have taken place
in Old European times, but we have little archaeological evidence for them.
Although peculiar by modem standards, in both Europe and the Near East,
ancient peoples considered this sacred male and female coupling neces
sary for the well-being and fertility of the land and its inhabitants. We
find widespread texts describing sacred marriage rites in the earliest his
torical records, dating to around 30 0 0 b .c .9 The prevalence of the rite by
that time speaks for an earlier origin, probably communal, perhaps in the
Old European religious system, though little evidence exists. From (fatal
Huyuk, archaeologists recovered one figurine showing a couple engaging
in intercourse. Another came from the Near Eastern Natufian site, dat
ing to about 10,000 b .c . 10 The “Gumelnit;a Lovers,” a statuette from the

Gumelnita site in southern Romania, which depicts a man and a woman

Descriptions of sexual rituals mainly come from the earliest historical
records of the Near East. These texts refer to the “sacred marriage” (in
ancient Greek the hierosgamos), in which a couple engaged in ceremonial
sexual intercourse. Ritual duties fell on only a few special individuals, priest
esses (representing the goddess) and priests (representing the year god),
or queens and kings, who performed the rite on behalf of their subjects.11
Images of Death and Regeneration
In the cycle of life, the feminine force— the goddess— not only manifested
in birth, fertility, and life sustenance, she also embodied death, decay, and
regeneration.12 As death wielder, she loomed as a terrifying raptor, a poi
sonous snake, or the stiff white nude. For Old European cultures, how
ever, death did not portend the ultimate end but remained part of nature’s
cycle. In Old European religious imagery, death was immediately coupled
with regeneration. Yet regeneration continued timelessly, and special
images (especially those of water creatures) specifically reminded the devo
tees of the goddess that she stayed with them. In this role, we see the god
dess traversing both worlds— death’s illusory terror and birth’s sweet
promise— providing a link between them.
Birds o f Prey
Raptors— birds of prey— most often embody death in Old European
imagery The “Vulture Shrine” at Catal Huyiik provides a graphic exam
ple. The walls of the shrine show painted vultures with outstretched wings
swooping down on headless bodies. Several thousand miles away, in the
megalithic tombs of western Europe, another bird of prey predominates.
There devotees carved the likeness of the owl, specifically its eyes, into
the bones and stones of the awesome monuments. This imagery also
appears on the solitary standing stones known as menhirs. At both Catal
Huyuk and the megalithic monuments, additional features connect these
two raptors with the goddess. Some of the vultures of Catal Huyuk pos
sess human feet, while the megalithic stony owl eyes stare from above a
necklace and human breasts— and frequently appear with the human vulva.
The superhuman qualities and near-human appearance of the owl
its upright perch, mortal stare, fantastic vision, and nightly screams
especially evoked mystery and awe. Fascination with this bird must predate
the Neolithic. The owl appears on Upper Paleolithic cave walls: three snowy
owls are identified in Les Trois Freres cave, in southern France. History

as well as iconography connects the owl with important goddesses such
as Athena, the Greek goddess of knowledge and wisdom, and Lil-Lilith,
the Sumerian-Akkadian goddess whose name also appears in the Hebrew
Old Testament. It has been postulated that Lilith’s name may mean
“screech owl.” This night bird naturally rules death and the underworld.
Old European owl symbolism fuses death and life. Owl representations
on tombs and statues in Brittany and Ireland have a vulva in the center.
Owl-shaped urns from the north Aegean also exhibit a vulva or snake coils.
Portuguese dolmens include regenerative phallic objects with the owl god
dess’ features (Fig. 11). Owl and snake associations continue repeatedly
throughout the Neolithic and into the Bronze Age. The owl’s eyes may be
considered the most impressive symbols of regeneration, especially when
they are depicted on bare bones, symbols of death (Fig. 12).
An understanding of the practice of excamation helps us to clarify the
20 / Images of Goddesses and Gods



role of the bird of prey in Neolithic religion; it particularly explains its
role in the death process. In this burial practice, people did not bury their
dead immediately, but exposed them outdoors on platforms. There, birds
of prey would strip the body of its flesh, leaving only the bones. The removal
of flesh was considered necessary to complete the death process. When
only the bones remained, the individual could be buried and the next seg
ment of the cycle could begin. Two different raptors predominated in Old
European mortuary symbolism, each in a different region: the vulture
dwells only in the Near East and southern Europe, while the owl lives in
most of Europe. Although excamation was not universally practiced,
throughout Europe and the Near East vulture and/or owl symbols repre
sented the goddess who brought death, yet ruled life and assured birth.
The Stiff White Goddess
Goddess figurines consistently accompanied people in their graves,
where the goddess lay stiff as the bare bone that symbolizes death. Her
forearms are folded across her torso, assuming the same position in which
corpses were often buried (Fig. 13a-f). In an obvious association with
death, the figurine is bone-colored, often carved from marble, alabaster,
or other white stone. Unlike other figurines, the stiff white goddess pos
sesses small breasts, downplaying her nourishing or life-sustaining
aspects. In this form, the goddess accompanies her people through their
transition to her other realm. Very common depictions of the stiff white
goddess are the Cycladic figurines, dating from circa 32 0 0 to circa 2000
b .c ., excavated from graves in the Cycladic Islands of the Aegean Sea. While
remarkable in their geometric proportions and sometimes considered the
source for later developments in classical art, the Cycladic figurines in fact
have prototypes created three thousand years earlier for burials in south
ern and southeast Europe.
For Old European cultures, time moved in cycles, not a terminating
line. This worldview applied as much to life and death as to sowing and
harvest. Regeneration immediately followed death. The stiff white god
dess specifically linked death with regeneration through her exaggerated
pubic triangle. The proportions of the figurines draw attention to the womb,
promising regeneration from the body of the goddess. So at death, when
one’s remains are placed in the tomb, he or she symbolically reenters the
goddess’ body to be reborn.
Neolithic and later sculptures of stiff figures represent the white god
dess as one of her main epiphanies: the bird of prey or poisonous snake.
Some sculptures feature masks with no facial attributes other than a large
nose, which may symbolize a bird’s beak (Fig. 13b, e, f). Some examples
from western Anatolia have wings in addition to the protruding large nose.

Similar figures come from Mesopotamia and the eastern Mediterranean
area. For instance, an elaborate tiara crowns the nude and winged Sumer
ian Lil (Hebrew Lilith), who grips her lion mount with her taloned feet
(circa 2300 b .c .). Two owls flank her. Many of her eastern Mediterranean
portrayals from the fourteenth to thirteenth centuries b .c . still reflected
the same bearing: nude, with a large pubic triangle, an enormous owl’s
beak, and huge round earrings.
Other stiff white goddess masks look totally different: they lack promi
nent noses and instead feature teeth below a long mouth (Fig. 13c). Masks
with prominent noses characterize the Mediterranean and Aegean areas,
while those with emphasized mouths typify the Karanovo culture in Roma
nia and Bulgaria. The long-mouth masks are broad and usually have pierced
earlobes for attaching copper or gold earrings; they also have perforated
chins for affixing copper or gold ring-shaped pendants (Fig. 14a-b). Some
masks are shown with a diadem or turban (Fig. 14b). The gold ring-shaped
pendants appear slightly anthropomorphized, having eyes above the cen
tral hole and a protrusion for the head. This type of mask— broad, with
a long mouth and teeth— represents the face of the snake, the second
main epiphany of the white goddess. Folklore provides much support for
this assumption. Although in some countries (for instance, Ireland),

the goddess of death appears as a white lady in the guise of a raptor, in
other countries, particularly in eastern Europe, she appears as a poiso
nous snake.
The Gorgon
Some of the most remarkable masks recovered from Old European exca
vations very likely represent the snake goddess. Archaeologists unearthed
these masks from the Varna cemetery in eastern Bulgaria on the Black Sea
coast, famous for its finds of gold and jewelry dating to the mid-fifth mil
lennium b.c. Attached to the life-sized Varna masks were gold ornaments:
a diadem and ring-shaped pendants. The masks’ round eyes, long mouth,
and studs representing teeth were characteristic of the snake. These masks
were covered with jewelry and symbolic items: rhytons; deer’s teeth; ce
ramic dishes; triangular bone pendants; shell, stone, and gold beads; a
spindle whorl; a double-egg head pin; and red ocher and a dish for crush
ing ocher. Despite the frightening profiles of the Varna mask, the offer
ings buried with them— especially deer teeth, double eggs, red ocher,
triangles, and spindle whorls— symbolize regeneration and life. These sym
bolic grave goods suggest that worshipers conducted rituals of regenera
tion when they buried the goddess’ mask.
The same mask type found at Varna and depicted on stiff nude fig
urines (Figs. 13c and 14) also appears on enthroned goddesses and anthro
pomorphic vases. An anthropomorphic vase from the site of Sultana (near
Oltenfia in southern Romania), dating to the mid-fifth millennium b.c.,
furnishes further clues for deciphering this aspect of the goddess. The vase
shows a goddess with a horrific face, exposed teeth, and a lolling tongue.
She is the ancestress of the frightening Gorgon, familiar to us from Greek
mythology As with the Varna masks, the Sultana vase juxtaposes the image
of death with symbols of regeneration: the front of the vase depicts a large
vulva flanked with crescents, and the back shows spirals, bird feet, and a
double egg (see Gimbutas 1989, Fig. 327). Certain Old European cul

Figure 16. Archaic Greek Gorgons exhibit staring eyes, large fangs, and extended tongue, with vines, snakes, and lizards emanating from their heads, (a) Relief (Syracuse Museum, Italy); (b) Painting from an Attic amphora (Louvre Museum, Paris, France).
tures, in fact, developed Gorgon imagery well before the fifth millennium
b.c. The Gorgon extends back to at least 60 0 0 b.c., as a ceramic mask from
the Sesklo culture illustrates (Fig. 15).13 The Gorgon is a genuinely Euro
pean symbol, and she makes her presence known throughout the south
eastern European Neolithic and Bronze Ages.
The Gorgon finds her most frightening realization in ancient Greek
images that date from the seventh to the fifth centuries b.c. Some of these
images, undoubtedly inherited from Neolithic times, append the grinning
mask and pendant tongue of the Gorgon Medusa to the body and wings
of a bee, an important symbol of life regeneration. Masks of her paralyz
ing face almost always adjoin symbols of dynamic life energy: vines, snakes,
spirals, and lizards (Fig. 16a-b). The Rhodos Gorgon, dated from the late
seventh century b.c., has bee wings, yet she also clutches cranes.14
25 / Images of Goddesses and Gods



Greek texts record the belief that blood from Medusa’s snaky locks con
tained magic properties that could both create and destroy. The first ven
omous drop from the Medusa’s hair-snakes caused instant death; the
second, from Medusa’s veins, brought rebirth and life.15 The death-drop
of Medusa’s blood may have been a transposed and distorted memory of
women’s powerful moon-blood, and Medusa’s terrible mask could reflect
menstrual fears and taboos. Even in many contemporary cultures, super
stitions warn that the look of a menstruating woman can turn a man to
stone, contaminate food, or endanger hunting. By the seventh century b .c .,
Medusa’s head, chopped off by the hero Perseus, was appropriated for the
aegis, or badge of divine power, intended to protect the viewer from evil.
The Gorgon was frequently placed on coins, public buildings, temple ped
iments, individual seals, public and private roof tops, and the shields of
warriors; she also adorns the breastplate of the warrior-goddess Athena.
Juxtaposition of the goddess’ breasts and vulva with death symbols,
particularly raptors, reflects the Neolithic belief that the goddess brought
both life and death. At Qatal Huyiik, the walls of a shrine portray breasts
molded in clay relief over the beaks of vultures. Until recently, researchers
thought that such reliefs were confined to Anatolia, the Near East, and
southeast Europe. However, recently there has been a significant find in
central Europe, in an Alpine lake. Archaeologists working in Lake Con
stance on the Swiss-German border investigated a building of the Pfyn
culture (3 9 0 0 -3 8 0 0 b .c .), now submerged in shallow waters. Wood
structures with simple clay-coated walls typify this region and time
period. Unusual reliefs and paintings, however, decorated the interior of
this structure, including images of breasts. The parallels between Qatal
Huyiik and Lake Constance are striking. Both reveal shrines dedicated to
the goddess of death and regeneration worshiped across Europe and the
Near East.
SYM BOLS S P E C IFIC TO REG EN ERA TIO N
The spontaneous generation of nature was a major concern of Neolithic
religion. This preoccupation generated the flood of Old European sacred
images concerned with renewal. Most images honored various animals:
fish, frogs, dogs, goats, hedgehogs, bulls’ heads, all of which symbolize
the uterus in some way. Some images reflected the natural world: seeds,
vines, trees, phalli, plant shoots, life columns. Abstract symbols also
occurred frequently: spirals, hooks, triangles, and concentric circles. We
shall see how all were symbols of regeneration that embodied nascent life
ready to burst forth. These symbols often fused with the ultimate sym
bols of regeneration: the goddess’ body and procreative organs.
26 / Images of Goddesses and Gods



The Frog and Frog Goddess
The significance of the fish and frog to regenerative symbolism derives
from their aquatic environment. Their habitat paralleled the uterine amni
otic fluid, that watery realm where regeneration takes place. The annual
spring appearance of the frog and toad and their close resemblance to the
human fetus further emphasize their regenerative associations.
Neolithic art features myriad female and frog hybrids. At many Neolithic
sites, artisans carved small frog-shaped goddesses from green or black stone
and set them in relief on vases and temple walls (Figs. 17 and 18). The
presence of the goddess’ vulva accentuates the regenerative force of these
images.
Neolithic pottery often stresses schematized frogs. Abbreviated into a
hieroglyph, the frog or toad became an M sign. Large vases from the Vinca
and Tisza cultures, dating to around 50 0 0 b .c ., bear an M sign on the neck
above the goddess’ human countenance. Certain peculiar handles cannot
be human arms, but instead resemble frog legs (Fig. 19a-b). Frog-leg han
dles became a conventional feature that identified the frog goddess on
anthropomorphic vases.

The frog and toad image, along with the frog-shaped woman display
ing her vulva, appears across a wide time span, not only during the Euro
pean and Anatolian Neolithic but in the Near East, China, and the
Americas. Several closely related frog deity images in Egypt and the Near
East help explain the function of this goddess. Egyptians revered the frog
as Heket, primordial mother of all existence. In the early predynastic period
(around 31 0 0 b .c .) , she was portrayed as a woman with a frog head, or
as a frog or toad impersonating the goddess. “Frog” was her hieroglyphic
sign. Heket controlled fecundity and regeneration after death. Heket has
been connected with the Greek Baubo, probably a wet nurse, and with
the Sumerian Bau, also called Baba. Bau was the Sumerian goddess of med
icine and healing. A tablet from Lagash dating from circa 2500 b .c . describes
a temple dedicated to her and lists seven hundred priestesses, priests, and
attendants who participated in the temple’s consecration.16Although these
latter goddesses are not represented as frogs, they have connections to the
fecundity of nursing and to healing.
Baubo is the goddess who displays her vulva,17 sometimes raising her
skirt in a ritual that possibly dates to the Neolithic. Skirt-raising rituals
are known from Egypt; the Greek historian Herodotus describes them in
his histories, recorded in 445 b .c ., calling them ana-suromai. Diodorus,
writing in 60 b .c ., mentioned that he saw women enacting a skirt-raising
ritual before the sacred bull, Apis, in the Serapeum temple at Memphis.
In the early twentieth century, the Egyptologist Margaret Murray
hypothesized that Baubo came to Europe from Egypt via Crete and Greece.
Frog-women with exposed vulvas appear in Anatolia as early as the sev
enth millennium, however, confirming that Baubo’s origins predate the
Egyptian references. Murray, of course, did not have access to Neolithic
frog-woman imagery during her lifetime, so she made her connection'

through myths, crafts, and other novelties imported from Egypt or the
Near East. The conception of this image may even date to the Upper Pale
olithic, since bone engravings of frog-women appear in Magdalenian times.
Linguistic evidence also upholds Baubo’s local European source. Some
European languages use the root bau or bo in association with names for
toads, witches, or mushrooms. In Lithuania, baubas and bauba denote a
frightening witch or monster.18 I believe these words reflect the names of
the goddess of death and regeneration before she was rendered a demon.
In France, the words bo (in the province of Haut Saone), botet (in Loire),
and hot mean “toad.”
The frog goddess’ dynamic persistence explains a most mysterious his
torical image. The “impudent” Sheela na gig (Fig. 20) appears on stone

buildings in England, France, Ireland, and Wales, where she sits naked,
with open, froglike legs and her hands touching her vulva. These figures
were carved on castles and churches between the twelfth and the sixteenth
centuries. You can usually see them above the arched entry or on church
walls. The Sheela na gig’s hands either point to her genitals or part her
labia. Some of her sculptures have frightening heads or even skeleton-like
skulls. The Sheela na gig is still highly revered but her presence, not sur
prisingly, is shrouded in mystery. She is none other than the descendant
of the ancient frog goddess, the great regeneratrix. Many images of and
beliefs about frogs and toads endured through the Bronze and Iron Ages
and in European folklore and folk art (Fig. 21a-b ).
Fish and the Fish Goddess
Another creature clearly homologized with the uterus and associated
with aquatic symbolism is the fish. Her imagery continues through the
Paleolithic and Neolithic Old Europe, the Near Eastern and Aegean
Bronze Age, and the classical Greek era. In Upper Paleolithic and Neo
lithic engravings and paintings, fish shapes are marked with a net de
sign, which, because it is used to capture fish in water, becomes a symbol
of moisture. Engravings on bone objects dating from the Upper Pale
olithic Magdalenian period frequently include fish associated with
sprouts, buds, plants, snakes, does, and phalli (see Marshack 1972,
1 7 0 -7 9 ,3 3 0 ). These engraved objects apparently marked seasonal spring
rituals of regeneration.

We can vividly see that fish represent the goddess’ life-giving uterus in
vase paintings portraying fish within the goddess’ body. A famous vase
from Boeotia, central Greece, dating from the end of the seventh century
b .c ., represents one such example. Here she is Artemis, the Lady of the
Beasts, surrounded by lions, a bull’s head, upward winding snakes, water
birds, and swastikas, all exuding the powers of spring: the energies that
reawaken life.
Fish images occur in temples and tombs: at Bugibba, a Maltese tem
ple, archaeologists found a fish engraved on an altar stone, while in the
Hypogeum, the underground tomb of Malta, a fish was portrayed in relief
lying on a couch. Likewise, funerary ceramics from Minoan sarcophagi
and offering vessels commonly exhibit the fish motif. The triangular tem
ples of Lepenski Vir contained the most remarkable and unique exam
ples of monumental fish goddess sculptures, dating from 6 5 0 0 -5 5 0 0 b .c .
(Fig. 22a-c) (see the discussion on Lepenski Vir temples, in chapter 3).
The Lepenski Vir sculptures not only combine several regenerative sym
bols— egg and fish, or woman, fish, and water streams (Fig. 22a)— but
they amalgamate a new image using the fish and goddess of death and
regeneration, highlighting her breasts, her vulva, and the claws of a bird
of prey (Fig. 22b).
Hedgehogs and the Hedgehog Goddess
Archaeology and folklore both connect the hedgehog with regenera
tion. Hedgehog-shaped ceramic objects occur throughout the Mediter
ranean Neolithic, Bronze, and Iron Ages. A vase lid resembling a hedgehog,

depicting a face and a wart-covered body, is known from the Gumelnfia
culture in Romania from around 4 5 0 0 -4 3 0 0 b.c. (Fig. 23a); other hedge
hog-shaped vases are known from related cultures. During the Aegean
Bronze Age, the Minoan hedgehog goddess wore a skirt with spikes imi
tative of the hedgehog (Fig. 23b). The hedgehog goddess’ link with regen
eration is clearly shown by the early Greeks’ use of hedgehog-shaped urns
for infant burials. To this day in European folklore, the goddess disguised
as a hedgehog appears in animal stalls. Until the start of the twentieth cen
tury, women with uterine problems carried spiked balls painted red, called
“hedgehogs,” to churches in Alpine villages.
The Dog, Double o f the Death and Regeneration Goddess
In European mythologies, the dog accompanies or may double for the
goddess of death and regeneration (Greek Flekate, Germanic Holle or Hel,
Baltic Giltinė, and others). The many dog images in Neolithic sculpture
and painting may evidence an analogous role in prehistory. Dog sculp
tures appear in clay, marble, alabaster, and rock crystal. Dog figures often
decorated cult vases as protomes or handles. Vases themselves took on
the dog’s shape, and dog sculptures often wore human masks (Fig. 24).
Many cemeteries and megalithic tombs, enclosures, and roundels (see
below) have revealed dog skeletons, which attest to their profound sacri
ficial role. Whole dog skeletons were found within the altars of the Lep
enski Vir shrines. The dog’s role in regenerative symbolism can best be

dogs portrayed on large pear-shaped vases jump through the air and bark
at the moon. In many compositions, they flank a tree of life, a caterpillar,
or a crescent and full moon— all potent symbols of regeneration (Fig. 25).
The howling, barking dog apparently played a symbolic role in stimulat
ing regeneration and succoring the growth process.
The Goat
Illustrations of goats cavorting next to sprouting plants clearly expressed
the goat’s prehistoric and early historic vitality. In some images, plants actu
ally sprout from goats’ bodies (Fig. 26a-c). On a Minoan seal scene, goats
copulate;19 the he-goat’s sexual power represented the great stimulating
force necessary to renew life, while the she-goat provides the milk used
to make both cheese and yogurt.20 In vase decorations, goats or excited
men pose next to a life tree; the two exude analogous sexual power, and
they play comparable roles in life stimulation. The goat’s symbolic alliance
with the tree of life, plants, and the moon— symbols also associated with
the dog— reveals that the two played related roles in metaphors of regen
eration.
Bucranium and Bull Horns
The bull epitomized regeneration during the Neolithic. In patriarchal
religion, however, the bull symbolizes physical power and masculinity.

Indo-European mythologies specifically identify the bull as an animal of
the thunder god.21 However, the key to understanding Neolithic rendi
tions of the bull’s head and horns (bucranium in archaeological literature)
comes through their resemblance to the female uterus and fallopian tubes.
In the temples of Catal Huytik, on a series of female forms there are actu
ally depicted bucrania where the uterus and fallopian tubes should be (Fig.
27). The analogy takes on more meaning when we consider that rosettes,
often identified with bull’s horns, correspond to the flowerlike ends of the
fallopian tubes. The artist Dorothy Cameron, who originally made this
observation,22 speculates that people observed the corpse’s anatomy
unfolding during excarnation, when birds of prey stripped away the flesh
and exposed the internal organs. However peculiar this symbolism may
seem, there is no denying its existence. Bucrania consistently appear asso
ciated with tombs and the goddess’ womb.
The particular sites where bucrania appear confirm their connection
to death and regeneration. We consistently find bucrania in Old Euro
pean and Anatolian temples of regeneration, such as Part;a, Catal Huyiik,
and many others. These Old European cultures also situated this image
within tombs, particularly megalithic tombs featuring the owl goddess.
This goddess stands as a statue-menhir at megalithic tomb entrances in
southern France, where she wears a bucranium-shaped pendant (Fig.
28a-b). This life-giving symbol must have strengthened the owl goddess’

potency as goddess of regeneration. In Brittany, megaliths show rough
engravings of anthropomorphic images with a protrusion for the head,
probably schematic portrayals of the same tomb regeneration goddess.
These outlines also appear with bucrania, horns, and hooks. The stone
stela at Mane-er-H’Roeck features horns and hooks within the image’s
body, some placed exactly where the uterus should be. The U shapes with
hooked ends and paired or single hooks encountered on interior tomb
walls in Brittany and elsewhere may be streamlined bucrania or horns.
Their repetition in engravings may have been necessary to evoke or ensure
life powers. Old European cultures sculpted bucrania or sacred horns above, or
flanking entrances to, subterranean tombs. The Sardinian hypogea give
thousands of examples (Fig. 29). The heads or horns appear in relief: some
in natural form, but most in simplified geometric shapes. In Old Euro
pean art, the symbolic life energy, rising from the cow’s or bull’s head or
sacred horns, represents reborn new life or the goddess herself. She takes

on a great variety of shapes: a double triangle (hourglass), a human-bee
combination, a butterfly with a crowned human head, or simply a plant (Fig. 30).
Phallus
In the symbolism of regeneration, the phallus represents the male force.
Its energy correlates with the snake, the tree of life, the column of life, or
the cave stalagmite. In depictions, the phallus emerges from the sacred
horns like the tree of life. The phallus can be portrayed as a separate sculp
ture, or as part of a figurine or other cult object. Sometimes the phallus
shows aquatic and other symbols of regeneration. In the early Neolithic
(seventh and early sixth millennia b.c.), sometimes the phallus becomes
the neck of a female figurine. Here it is used to enhance the goddess’ regen
erative powers (Fig. 31a-c). Independent phallic stands (made specially
with flat bases), produced during various Neolithic phases, may have rep
resented stimulators of life energy. They may have symbolized a phallic
god similar to the later Greek Hermes. Phallic shapes frequently appear
as wine-cup stems (known from the Vinca, Butmir, and Danilo cultures
around 50 0 0 b.c.). Perhaps such cups were used during the spring festi
vals resembling the Dionysian type known from Greek times. Festivals
such as the Dionysian may have originated as early as the Neolithic.

The phallus continued to be an icon of regeneration well into the his
torical era. In India, temples feature an upright, phallus-shaped stone, a
lingam. Although these stones are obvious phallic representations, most
people mistakenly regard them (and most of the goddess’ images) as mere
fertility or sexual symbols. In fact, these symbols— the phallus, life col
umn, and lingam— intimately bind the male force to the goddess of
regeneration.
Triangle and Double Triangle (Hourglass)
The triangle (representing the pubic triangle) has remained a central
life-giving and regenerative symbol throughout prehistory and into mod
ern times. We can see forms of this symbol from as early as the Lower
Paleolithic Acheulian era (circa 30 0 ,0 0 0 b .c .) to modem triangular images
of the Virgin Mary and the Christian Trinity. In Neolithic art, the trian
gular stone epitomizes the goddess herself. Large triangular stones stand
at megalithic tomb entrances, or they stand as backstones deep within a
megalith. Sometimes they display her special symbols of energy: hooks,
horns, and triangular axes. In temples, large clay or stone triangles served
as altarpieces. In a temple at Kokenydomb in southeast Hungary, dating
from around 5000 b .c . , there stood a triangular clay altar; from the smaller
triangle underneath it peered the face of the goddess. Engraved meanders

decorate the altars facade, which is divided into the upper and lower
“realms”by a band of larger meanders. Groups of three lines mark its sides
(Fig. 32). The regenerative function of the goddess’ triangular shape
becomes apparent when it appears in context with other symbols of regen
eration. A truly vibrant energy exudes from scenes that depict the trian
gular goddess on Cucuteni vases, from around 400 0 b .c . (Fig. 33a-b). The
illustrated example portrays a multibodied goddess with outstretched arms
(which resemble bird feet) standing within a composition consisting of a
turning wheel and sweeping bands of rain torrents. In this scene, she seems
to command the cosmic powers themselves. This hourglass-shaped god
dess frequently occurs in vase paintings from the Cucuteni (Tripolye) cul
ture, dating from 4 5 0 0 to 300 0 b .c . The vases depict her as a center
cartouche flanked by huge spirals, chevrons, or meanders (Fig. 34).
Such hourglass-shaped figures clearly depict either the formidable god
dess of regeneration herself, or her maidens performing ring dances or
regenerative rites. Certain associations and specific gestures suggest regen
erative rituals, essential during the winter period. The goddess, as a bird
of prey, often touches her head with one arm, while her other arm rests
on her waist. Such figures have a fringed skirt; this brushlike symbol is
related to the symbol of solar rays and is a powerful designation of energy
(see Gimbutas 1989, 2 3 9 -4 3 ). In representations painted or incised on
ceramics found between Sardinia and Ukraine from the fourth millennium
b .c ., triangular goddess figures appear with sprouts, branches, and suns.
Sometimes the round head of the goddess radiates like the sun. From the

Sardinian Ozieri culture, triangular figures have heads that seem to be radi
ating suns or have giant hair (perhaps a prototype of the Gorgon’s snaky
hair). These images also have bird feet (Fig. 35). Solar rays, brush, and
hair, in combination with bird iconography, may have been interchange
able symbols; we see these symbols in combination on an early Vinca vase
from about 5000 b .c .: the painted figures seem to portray a cross between
the vulture goddess, with bird claws, and the sun, since rays emanate from
her head. This odd symbolic group— sprout, branch, sun, hair, spiral, raptor,
hourglass, bird feet, and triangle— belongs to the same goddess,23 who
mainly functions to awaken nature’s dormant life energy during the tran
sitional period from winter to spring. When we observe the association
of these symbols in context, this meaning becomes comprehensible. This
association takes place repeatedly through time and space in prehistory
and history, where the goddess appears in mythology and folklore iden
tified with these symbols. For instance, the Germanic sun goddess known
from runes appears with a round head and body shaped like a comb or
fringed skirt representing energy.
Thus the goddess effects regeneration on the universal as well as indi
vidual plane. Just as she effects the transition of an individual from death
to rebirth, so she also brings about the rebirth of all of life. This multi
plicity of symbols that we have been discussing— sprout, branch, sun, hair,
spiral, raptor, hourglass, bird feet, and triangle— represents the goddess

of regeneration in her most calendric aspect, for at this time, the thresh
old of the new spring, she regenerates all of plant and animal life.
Conclusions
The symbolism of Old Europe was rich and varied.24 The divine— both
goddesses and gods— was represented by many images: animal, human,
and abstractions.
From the time pottery was first fired in the seventh millennium b .c . in
Italy, the Balkans, central Europe, Asia Minor, and the Near East, and to
a lesser extent in other areas of Europe, ancient artisans began to craft fig
urines of humans and animals. Most of these were small enough to fit into
one’s hand. Many were marked with symbols that may have represented
an ancient form of script.25 Thus far, more than one hundred thousand
Neolithic figurines have been found.
Symbolically, these figurines, often nude, represented much more than
fertility and sexuality. They represented procreation, nurturing, death, and
regeneration. The body of the figurine is usually abstracted or exagger
ated in some manner. Schematic bodies often depicted the sacred force,
emphasizing the divinity of the nurturing breast, the pregnant belly, or
the life-giving vulva. Many of these figurines have masklike faces; the masks
personify a supernatural force, many of them representing animals: snake,
bird, pig, bear. Many figurines are in a birth-giving position; these figures
date from the Upper Paleolithic through the Neolithic. Mother and child
figurines are also numerous, often represented in connection with bear
or deer.
One of the most commonly depicted animals in Neolithic art was the
bird: the waterbird, the spring bird, the bird of prey. Bird figures often
41 / Images of Goddesses and Gods



have large eyes, beak-shaped noses, and no mouths; many have stumpy,
wing-shaped arms and exaggerated buttocks. Snake figures, too, were fre
quently represented in Old Europe. Because the snake sloughs its skin, it
manifestly depicts renewal.
The pregnant vegetation goddess, the earth mother, was frequently
unearthed near bread ovens. She personified the analogy between human
and animal pregnancy and the annual cycle of plant germination, growth,
and harvest. In the classical era, this figure was represented in dual form,
as daughter and mother, maiden and crone, spring-summer and fall-winter.
The consort of the pregnant vegetation goddess was the vegetation year
god. He too went through the life cycles of young virility, the maturity
that betokens harvest, and old age. The union of the goddess and god was
the hieros gamos, the sacred marriage.
The goddess of birth and life was also a goddess of death and regen
eration. She represented the full cycle of the life continuum. Representa
tions of death goddesses imbued with the promise of new life remind us
that the cycle was a totality. These are represented in both the prehistoric
and the early historical eras. In the Greek Cycladic Islands were found
pregnant, stiff, nude death figures (see the marble pregnant Cycladic fig
ure, British Museum No. GR 1 9 3 2 -1 0 .1 8 1 ; 2 8 0 0 -2 3 0 0 b.c.), and in the
Sumerian poem “Descent of Inanna,” the underworld goddess, Ereshki
gal, groans in childbirth as she brings forth life out of death.
In Old Europe and Old Anatolia, the goddess of death and regenera
tion is often depicted as a bird of prey, as a stiff, bone-colored nude, or as
a poisonous snake. The bird and snake are complementary in death and
regeneration as well as in life and nurturing. Many of the figures resem
ble the Gorgon found in later classical Greece.
Perhaps the greatest number of Old European symbols depicted regen
eration: the frog and fish (historical representations of the frog goddess
include the Greek Baubo or Iambe and the Irish Sheela na gig, both of
whom, in frog posture, vividly display their vulvas); hedgehogs, which
closely resemble the uterus; the dog (whose association with death con
tinues into the classical era); the goat; and the bull. The phallus, too, is an
important and frequently depicted regenerative symbol, as is the triangle,
representing the female pubic triangle.
These symbols, taken together, represent the eternal cycle of birth, life,
death, and rebirth.

CHAPTE R TWO
Symbols, Signs, and Sacred Script
D
uring the sixth millennium b.c., the Old Europeans developed a writ
ing system; like many other Old European achievements, writing
grew out of religious symbols and signs.
Paleolithic Roots
Humans have been communicating by means of symbols for a very long
time. Abstract signs emerge in the Lower Paleolithic Acheulian and Mous
terian periods (from circa 300,000 to 100,000 b.c.), long before the appear
ance of the extraordinary Upper Paleolithic art (from circa 35,000 to 10,000
b.c.). The familiar Upper Paleolithic images depict exquisite animals painted
or etched on cave walls. They were also carved on bone or stone tools and
made into figurines. But very few people notice the manifold abstract signs
that often accompany the animals. These marks include V’s, Ys, M’s, P’s,
dots, eggs, seeds, “arrows” (£ —»), two, three, or more lines, branching
configurations, and squares divided into four or more sections. Some of
the abstract signs known from the Acheulian era, such as V, M, and par
allel lines (engraved on the rib from Pech de LAze, France, circa 30 0 ,0 0 0
b.c.: Fig. 36), continued through the Middle Paleolithic, Upper Paleolithic,
Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods.

An astonishing number of symbol and sign groupings persisted for sev
eral thousand years. They must have carried various symbolic messages,
and possibly the same or related meaning through time. These ancient
signs still have not been systematically studied. It is thought that many
symbols refer to the killing or wounding of animals. For instance, cup
marks and vulvas (A) on bison are explained as “wounds” and “arrows”;
another interpretation is that these signs represent the life source and life
enhancing symbols. Detailed analysis of how signs associate with one
another and correspond with similar Neolithic marks will encourage more
accurate interpretations. André Leroi-Gourhan’s Treasures o f Prehistoric Art
(1967) made a good start along these lines by publishing “paired signs.”
Many sign groupings, especially if associated with vulvas, deer teeth, and
pregnant mares, must be linked with life giving or life enhancement. Illus
trations from the Upper Paleolithic make this apparent (Fig. 37a-c). One,
found in Mezin, Ukraine, and dating to circa 1 8 ,0 0 0 -1 5 ,0 0 0 b .c ., repre
sents a figurine with supernatural vulva incised with signs inside and out
side; the context of the signs and their association with other pictures or
symbols affirm their life-giving or life-enhancing motif.
Several thousand years before the earliest writing of the Sumerians, Old
Europeans used symbolic designs and abstract signs to decorate temples,
sculpture, pottery, figurines, and other ritual objects. These signs could
have originally represented actual objects; for example, a triangle or “arrow”
($ ) may have represented the vulva, and winding parallel lines (“maca
roni”) may have portrayed flowing water. During the Paleolithic, abstract
signs appear beside remarkably realistic paintings of bison, wild horses,

and other animals stampeding across cave walls. Neolithic Old Europe
probably inherited these signs.
The observation that certain signs appear only on specific figurines and
associated cult objects led me to decipher Old European deity types and
functions. The results of this study first appeared in The Language o f the
Goddess (1989). For instance, in Old European art, bird goddess figures
show X and V signs, chevrons, meanders, and parallel lines similar to those
from the Upper Paleolithic (Fig. 38a-b). The longevity is amazing: the
signs endure for about 15,000 years, from the Upper Paleolithic through
the Neolithic. V signs and chevrons mark vases and other ritual objects
through time, serving the same divinity (Fig. 39a-c).
The large animals became extinct by the Neolithic, and so their asso
ciation with abstract signs also disappeared. However, we can see some

continuity: bovids with crescent horns associated with circles (that is, eggs)
continue from the Upper Paleolithic through the Neolithic and Bronze
Age (Fig. 40a-c). This grouping of symbols (cow-bull-ox, crescent, and
egg) belongs to the category of regeneration. As discussed earlier, in the
Neolithic the cow’s or bull’s homed head symbolizes the uterus with fal
lopian tubes, and it dominates temples and tombs for millennia. The
Neolithic bucrania and uteri may very well derive from the Upper Pale
olithic sign, which is a U shape with turned-down ends. The M sign sym
bolizes the frog goddess as life regenerator. (The M sign seems to abstractly
render frog legs; it figures prominently on Neolithic pottery. See Fig. 19a-b,
above.) The very frequent M sign on Paleolithic objects may also be linked
with the frog and the human birth posture, and therefore with regenera
tion. A distinct group of large vases from circa 5000 b.c. bears an M sign
below the goddess’ face. On this vase type, other regenerative symbols
also appear— nets, brush signs, spirals, meanders, butterflies, entrance or
gate symbols (rectangles or concentric rectangles, rhombi)— linked with
energy, the uterus-womb, and young life or transformation.
“Symbol Script” in Panels
Old European cultures produced vases with both aesthetic appeal and sym
bolic meaning. They expressed their symbolic designs on vases through
painting, incision, or encrustation. First, the artisan sectioned the vessel
surface into distinct areas, which would then convey specific concepts.

The vase’s neck, foot, belly, and handles created “natural” panels for dif
ferent symbolic designs (Fig. 41a). Second, the artisan repeated various
sized symbolic themes in the panels (Fig. 41b). Finally, the artisan made
an “infinite design” pattern, like a textile design (Fig. 41c), as if the vase
had a flat surface. Bands, panels, and metopes frame individual or mul
tiple motifs. The border emphasizes the enclosed symbol’s discreteness.
Conceptual painting and engraving effected a “symbolic script”whereby
specific motifs referred to commonly understood concepts. Knobbed seals
with symbols emerged in the seventh millennium, and by the sixth mil
lennium they carry groups of signs (Fig. 4 2a-c). Throughout the sixth
and fifth millennia b.c., single symbols (Fig. 43a) or sign groups (Fig. 43b)
also appear on ceramics framed in panels.

The Emergence of the Old European Script
Around 5 5 0 0 -5 0 0 0 b .c ., intriguing combinations of signs appear in the
archaeological record, contemporaneous with the conceptional symbol
script discussed above. The Starcevo-Vinca culture manifested the most
examples, but other Old European cultures also employed them. Some
thirty abstract signs build a core set. It is important to observe that these
signs indeed represent writing: instead of individual or random occur
rence in pottery panels, the script signs appear in rows or clusters, with
several different signs following one another (Figs. 4 4 a -b , 45a-b, and 46).
Abstract, not pictorial, signs comprised the script. Linearity characterizes
and organizes Old European writing, a trait it shares with the Minoan Lin

classical world. All these examples use similar diacritical techniques, such
as strokes or dots to modify a basic sign. Old European script is not
“prewriting” as conceived by Shan M. M. Winn (1981). It represents a true
writing system similar to Chinese, Sumerian, Indus, and pre-Columbian
“nuclear” (logographic) writing systems.1
The Old European script contains more than one hundred modified
signs. The modem Latin alphabet combines a relatively small set of indi
vidual signs (or letters) into hundreds of syllables. The Latin alphabet for
English uses only twenty-six letters. But the alphabet appeared somewhat

recently, originating around 1500 b .c . in the Near East. In ancient lan
guages, such as Egyptian or Sumerian, one sign usually represents a syl
lable or whole word. When a written language represents syllables and
especially words, it needs a large inventory of signs. The fact that Old Euro
pean script uses more than one hundred signs suggests that these may
have represented syllables and words.
Whereas commerce and trade mainly inspired the Sumerian invention
of cuneiform writing, the Old European script, developed two thousand
years earlier, may have developed to communicate with the divine forces.
The objects that bear inscriptions include seals, vases, loom weights, fig
urines, spindle whorls, pendants or plaques, temple models, and minia
ture ex voto pots or dishes. All these objects held religious significance
and occurred in religious contexts.
Although we cannot yet translate the inscriptions on these sacred ob
jects, we can deduce their general meaning from parallels in historical times.
In classical Greek and Roman cultures, and also Etruscan, Venetic, and
Mycenaean cultures, worshipers dedicated objects such as loom weights,
spindle whorls, figurines, and clay or lead tablets to a deity at a shrine or
holy site. Termed ex voto or votive, the dedicatory offering often featured
a message naming the deity and sometimes the worshiper.2Devotees often
made dedications for improved health, greater fertility, or safe childbirth.
Classical Greeks offered inscribed spindle whorls to Athena, and the Veneti,
who occupied northern Italy and the northern part of the Balkan Penin
sula, dedicated loom weights and lead tablets to Rehtia, their birth giver,
a deity similar to the Greek Artemis. The inscriptions on the Old Euro
pean artifacts, dating from five thousand years earlier, may also name deities
or individuals supplicating the goddess. Classical religion inherited the
tradition of dedicatory offerings, and Christianity eventually adopted the
same tradition. At modern pilgrimage sites in eastern and western Europe,
the faithful still leave offerings inscribed to the Virgin Mary or to saints.
D ISCO V ERY AND IN TER PRETA TIO N
Zsófia Torma came upon the Old European script signs, often named ‘Vinca
script,” while excavating the Turda§ (Tordos) mound near Cluj in Tran
sylvania (northwest Romania) in 1 8 74.3 Miloje Vasic also unearthed
numerous inscribed figurines and vessels while digging the Vinca site near
Belgrade, from 1908 to 1926. In Vasic’s opinion, the signs on Vinca vases,
figurines, and miniature vessels resembled letters, and he saw in these
inscriptions analogies to the inscriptions on Greek Archaic vases from
Lesbos. Jovan Todorovic excavated another Vinca site near Belgrade that
revealed hundreds of inscriptions on cultic objects. He published his results
in 1961. In 1963, Nicolae Vlassa wrote about several inscribed plaques
50 / Symbols, Signs, and Sacred Script



discovered in an early Vinca grave at Tartaria, near Cluj. He assumed that
the plaques (wrongly called “tablets”) were Mesopotamian imports. In 1968,
M. S. E (Sinclair) Hood considered the Tartaria plaques “an uncompre
hending imitation of more civilized people’s written records.” He failed to
recognize, however, that Old European writing, such as that on the Vinca
cultic objects, predated Mesopotamian script by several thousand years,
even though several good radiocarbon chronologies existed for the Vinca
culture in the late 1960s. North of Vinca, the archaeologists E Mora, Janos
Banner, Jozsef Csalog, and others discovered several inscribed vases and
figurines at Tisza Basin sites in southeastern Hungary in the 1930s and
1940s. Further north, in Czechoslovakia, excavators unearthed inscribed
vessels identified with the Linear Pottery culture, contemporary with early
Vinca. In Bulgaria, during the last thirty years, many Vinca and Karanovo
culture sites yielded inscribed seals, vessels, figurines, and other cultic
objects (particularly at Gradesnica near Vraca in northwestern Bulgaria).
Researchers now recognize inscribed and painted signs, unnoticed ear
lier, on Dimini, Cucuteni, Petre§ti, Lengyel, Butmir, and Biikk ceramics.
We can no longer point to “Vinca script” as the sole example of this phe
nomenon. Clearly this script characterizes the advanced and artistic civ
ilization of Old Europe; therefore I advocate the term Old European script.
D IFFICULTY OF DECIPHERING
The linguistic tradition between Old Europe and the modem world has
been broken, so we cannot yet translate the Old European script. Schol
ars have deciphered other ancient languages, such as Sumerian, Akka
dian, and Babylonian, which used the cuneiform script, because of the
fortuitous discovery of bilingual inscriptions. When cuneiform tablets were
first discovered in the eighteenth century of this era, it was very difficult
for scholars to decipher the script. Then inscriptions found in Iran at the
end of the eighteenth century a .d . provided a link: these inscriptions also
were written in cuneiform and in two other ancient languages, Old Per
sian and New Elamite: languages that had already been deciphered.4 It
took several decades, but European scholars eventually translated the
ancient cuneiform script via the more familiar Old Persian language. Sim
ilarly, the hieroglyphic writing of the Egyptians remained a mystery until
Napoleon’s troops unearthed the famous Rosetta stone in the late eigh
teenth century. The stone carried the same message written in ancient
Greek, Egyptian hieroglyphs, and Egyptian hieratic, a simplified cursive
form of hieroglyphs. The Rosetta stone thwarted scholars’ efforts for sev
eral decades in the early nineteenth century until Jean-Frangois Cham
pollion cracked several key hieroglyphic phrases using the Greek
inscriptions. Unfortunately, we have no Old European Rosetta stone to
51 / Symbols, Signs, and Sacred Script



chart the continuity between Old European script and the languages that
replaced it.
The Indo-European incursions into central Europe, from the late fifth
to the early third millennia b.c., caused a linguistic and cultural discon
tinuity These incursions disrupted the Old European sedentary farming
lifestyle that had existed for three thousand years. As the Indo-European
tribes encroached on Old Europe from the east, the continent underwent
upheavals. These severely affected the Balkans, where the Old European
cultures abundantly employed script. The Old European way of life dete
riorated rapidly, although pockets of Old European culture remained for
several millennia. The new peoples spoke completely different languages
belonging to the Indo-European linguistic family. The Old European lan
guage or languages, and the script used to write them, declined and even
tually vanished from central Europe.5
Linguistic changes buried deeply in the past may make deciphering
Old European script impossible. The ancient peoples on Crete and
Cyprus, however, left intriguing clues hinting that Old European language
and script survived the Indo-European invasions. Old European script signs
also emerged on Early and Middle Helladic Greek and Aegean Island pot
tery during the third millennium b.c. Crete’s island isolation preserved
Old European culture and religion longer than did Europe’s mainland.
Archaeologists discovered at least three separate writing forms on Crete:
Minoan hieroglyphs, Linear A, and Linear B. The earliest of these, the
Minoan hieroglyphic language, dates from about 2000 b.c.6 The latest of
these languages, Linear B, dates to about 1450 b.c.; Linear B tablets were
found on Crete and in Pylos, a later Mycenaean town in the southwest
ern Peloponnesus. All three scripts perplexed scholars for decades, until
the Englishman Michael Ventris deciphered Linear B in 1952, showing
that it represented a form of early Greek. In Linear B, each character rep
resented a syllable of the Greek language. In Linear B inscriptions we find
the names of Mycenaean goddesses and gods, some six hundred years
before classical Greek religion. The earlier Minoan scripts— hieroglyphs
and Linear A— remain a mystery.
In the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea, on the island of Cyprus,
excavators discovered several writing systems that preserve the languages
used there during different eras. The earliest of these, Cypro-Minoan, dates
to 1500 b.c. and resembles Minoan Linear A. Like the Minoan hieroglyphs
and Linear A, Cypro-Minoan remains undeciphered. Classical Cypriot syl
labic script appears later. The oldest document employing the Cypriot syl
labary dates to the late second millennium b.c., but the script was not
commonly used until the sixth century b.c. This fact implies that Cypriot
society was bicultural and bilingual, no doubt as a result of Indo-European
52 / Symbols, Signs, and Sacred Script



assimilation with or conquest of the indigenous peoples. The Cypriot
syllabic script was used to write two languages: Eteocypriot, a non-Indo
European language, and a Greek dialect having close affinities to the Arca
dian dialect. Researchers have translated the Greek documents written in
the Cypriot syllabary, but the Eteocypriot messages remain undecoded.
These languages— Minoan hieroglyphic, Minoan Linear A, Cypro
Minoan, and classical Cypriot— contain symbols closely resembling the
Old European script signs. Harold Haarmann’s books, Language in Its Cul
tural Embedding (1990a) and Early Civilization and Literacy in Europe (1996),
demonstrate similarities between Old European script signs, and Linear
A and Cypro-Minoan script signs.7 Old European elements form about
half of the Linear A and Cypro-Minoan sign list. Cyprus’ isolation lent
itself to cultural continuity, so it retained its literacy from pre-Greek times.
One can see the visual resemblance between Old European and Cypro
Minoan signs and their identical techniques in sign clusters. Parallels
between Old European script and Linear A, Cypro-Minoan, and classical
Cypriot scripts confirm the presence of the Old European legacy in Crete
and Cyprus well into historical times.
Today, almost all of Europe and parts of Asia embrace the same family
of languages, known as the Indo-European linguistic group. Indo-European
horsemen, infiltrating Europe, the Near East, and south Asia between 4500
and 2000 b.c., originally spread these languages, which have branched
and mutated over millennia. Early languages like Minoan and Eteocypriot
(and other European languages like Scotland’s Pictish and Italy’s Etruscan)
belong to completely unfamiliar language families, making their deci
pherment extremely difficult. In attempting to decipher Old European
script, scholars receive little assistance from most known languages.
Older languages have left fewer records, which further hampers deci
pherment of pre-Indo-European languages.8 For instance, archaeologists
have unearthed about ten times more (Indo-European) Linear B inscrip
tions than those in (pre-Indo-European) Linear A. The study of European
substrate languages constantly progresses, however, and contributes enor
mously to reconstructing the Old European world.
It is possible that someday, with more archaeological discoveries,
Minoan Linear A and the Cypro-Minoan languages will be deciphered and
that the Old European script itself might be translated. Ancient documents
have already provided important clues about the goddess’ role in early
religion. The Linear B clay tablets, for instance, name goddesses who are
probably Minoan in origin and provide some information about their rit
uals. Decipherment of other ancient languages and the Old European script
would bequeath to us an inestimable treasure of knowledge regarding the
goddess’ religion.
53 / Symbols, Signs, and Sacred Script



The phenomenon of linear script among the Old Europeans confirms
the very early roots of symbolic and abstract thinking. Most traditional
scholars consider the classical Greeks to be the progenitors of Western
logical and abstract thinking. Other researchers, however, cite the more
remote Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations. Old European script sug
gests that the intellectual heritage of Western Civilization goes much far
ther back than we have previously acknowledged, to the ancient goddess
worshipers who could think both symbolically and abstractly.
Conclusions
The prehistory of the written symbol is ancient: abstract signs date to the
Lower Paleolithic, from circa 300,000 b.c. to circa 100,000 b.c. In the Upper
Paleolithic, from circa 35,000 b.c. to circa 10,000 b.c., abstract signs accom
pany cave paintings and carvings of animals on bone and stone tools.9
The making of these signs persists through the Neolithic.
Some animals are associated with specific signs. For example, X and
V signs, chevrons, meanders, and parallel lines accompany bird figures,
and the M sign is found on representations of frogs. Further, symbols and
groups of signs appear on Old European pottery and figurines and may
comprise an Old European script. This script is not “prewriting”but a lin
ear script composed of more than one hundred abstract, not pictorial, signs.
Many of these symbols are found in a religious context, perhaps as
inscriptions on temple models, figurines, and plaques. Thus, Old Euro
pean script predated the earliest historical writings— those of Sumer and
Egypt— by several thousand years. The continuity of the Old European
writing was disrupted by the arrival of the Indo-Europeans; thereafter, writ
ing disappeared along with the manufacture of finely wrought polychrome
pottery and other attributes of Old European culture. Since there has not
yet been a Rosetta stone discovered that can help linguists to decipher
Old European script, it is as yet untranslatable. With time, we may dis
cover a bilingual text that will enable us to translate this script and thereby
reveal the intellectual heritage of the Old European peoples.

CHAPTER .THREE
The Tomb and the Womb
T
he funerary monuments of Old Europe provide us with invaluable
information on the artifacts, symbols, and contexts we need to
explore the Neolithic view of death and transition. Tombs and graves exhib
ited a variety of forms and designs, but even in widely separated areas of
Europe a remarkable underlying similarity marks the religious beliefs they
express. These monuments show that the Old European view of the
processes of death and transition fundamentally differed from the view of
death held by many later cultures. In ancient Indo-European and Chris
tian religions, a person’s soul maintained its individual identity and trav
eled to the land of the afterlife. In Neolithic religion, the processes of death
and transition were cyclical. As in the organic world, where new life grows
from the remains of the old, birth, according to the Old Europeans, was
part of a cycle that included death. Just as the goddess’ womb obviously
gave us birth, it also took us back in death. Symbolically, the individual
returned to the goddess’ womb to be reborn. Exactly what form this rebirth
was imagined to take is unknown; what is clear is that Old European reli
gion understood life and death as aspects of larger cyclic processes. Because
the womb constitutes one of the most potent funerary themes during this
era, we can think of the “tomb as womb.”Vulva and uterus images— both
natural and geometric— predominate. They can be found in the architecture
of the tomb or as symbols of the tomb itself.
Throughout Old Europe one finds structures that were both tombs and
shrines. These structures took the shape of the female body. In the mega
lithic complex at Mnajdra (circa 30 0 0 b.c.), on the Mediterranean island
of Malta, the temple complex consists of several separate structures.1Here,
two temples manifestly took the shape of the goddess. The earlier shrines
of Lepenski Vir, dating from circa 6 5 0 0 -5 5 0 0 b.c., represented an abstrac
tion of the goddess, a sacred triangle. Many tombs have a central passage,

Serbia).
perhaps evocative of the birth canal. In the cultures of Old Europe, the
tombs are representations of the goddess of regeneration, the goddess
whose womb and birth canal were the gateways to rebirth.2
The Triangular Shrines o f Lepenski Vir
The Iron Gates region of Serbia and Romania evokes an ageless sense of
awe in all who venture there. Also known as the Danube Gorge, it is where
the Danube River slices through a canyon gorge in the Carpathian moun
tains on its tumultuous eastward run to the Black Sea. Along this stretch
of river, numerous treacherous whirlpools (virs in Serbo-Croatian) chum
the waters of the Danube. Not surprisingly, prehistoric peoples chose this
enigmatic area to erect shrines dedicated to the ultimate mystery: the regen
eration of life from death.
In the m id-1960s, Romania and Serbia (then Yugoslavia) entered into
a joint hydroelectric development project to harness the Danube’s power
through the Iron Gates. The proposed dam was to flood the land to about
forty-five meters above its original level, destroying any potential Danube
Gorge archaeological sites. Archaeologists from both countries com
menced salvage operations on fourteen sites encompassing the Upper Pale
olithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic eras (Map 1). Many of these sites
distinctly differed from others excavated in the area. The first and largest
site explored, Lepenski Vir, dating from 6 5 0 0 -5 5 0 0 b.c., was located on
the Serbian side and faced a tumultuous whirlpool (Srejovic 1969; 1972;
Srejovic and Babovic 1983). Padina, located north of Lepenski Vir, belongs

to the same period and closely resembles Lepenski Vir (Jovanovic 1971).
Vlasac, three kilometers south of Lepenski Vir, was inhabited earlier (Sre
jovic and Letica 1978). Sites on the Romanian side tended to be earlier,
dating from the Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic.
Along the riverbank of Lepenski Vir, the excavators, Dragoslav Srejovic
and Zagorka Letica, found the remains of more than fifty small shelters
built over a thousand-year period. They dated from the mid-seventh to
the mid-sixth millennia b.c. Naturally, the original wooden poles that sup
ported the structures had long since vanished. But the floors, made of a
red limestone and clay mixture, remained rock-hard and had survived mil
lennia of Danube flooding. The shelters were quite small, about five to
seven meters long, and the floor plans were neither square nor round.
They looked like triangles with one com er cut off near the apex (Fig. 47).
Reconstructions suggest that they were open on one end, which always
faced the Danube River. The structures spread out in a long arc along the
riverbank and ringed an empty space in the middle.
Skeletons found under or near many of these stmctures suggest that
the stmctures had ritual purposes. Other features also indicate that they
were not meant for habitation, but for rites of death and regeneration. The
small size and triangular shape of the shelters would be unusual for
dwellings, but not for ritual stmctures. The triangle symbolizes the god
dess’ regenerative, sacred pubic triangle, while the conspicuously red lime
stone floors reflect the blood of life.
These shelters seem to symbolically duplicate the female reproductive
system. Each stmcture contained an altar built into the ground and lined

with upright stones. A trough ran down the center from the open end
(facing the river) to the narrow end (facing away from the river). It prob
ably represented the birth canal, positioned within the shelter’s regener
ative triangle. Many of the structures contained one or two stone sculptures,
standing about fifty to sixty centimeters high, at the head of the altar. These
stones exhibit important features pointing to their symbolic value in death
and regeneration. First, many stones were apparently intentionally cho
sen for their egg- or fishlike shape. Besides the obvious implication that
a bird or fish egg holds a new life source, the egg also signified the womb.
Red ocher, connoting blood and the life essence, covered many of the sculp
tures. The triangular outline of the sanctuary representing the goddess’
regenerative triangle, the altar depicting the birth canal, and the egg- (or
womb-) shaped stones reflecting the uterus at the head of the birth canal
together give a clear representation of the regenerative organs of the
goddess.
Some of the stone sculptures were carved with labyrinthine designs or
with geometric motifs suggestive of flowing water: symbols that appear
elsewhere in Old European art. Some sculptures display a carved vulva
(Fig. 48). But most important, many sculptures bear the combined fea
tures of woman, fish, and bird of prey. Their eyes and mouth reveal an
eerie, fishlike quality. Some sculptures look like a fish-faced deity with
human breasts and vulva, but with bird feet, most likely representing the
talons of a bird of prey (Fig. 22, above). This combination of symbols
human female-fish-bird of prey, carved on an egg-shaped stone— uniquely
58 / The Tomb and the Womb



coalesces symbols of regeneration. These symbols show that the Lepen
ski Vir sanctuaries served the goddess in her death- and life-giving guise.
Not surprisingly, given the location of these structures— overlooking the
river and its treacherous whirlpools— aquatic imagery and fish play a
prominent role at Lepenski Vir, and the goddess of death and regenera
tion takes on their shape.
But what rituals took place in these odd triangular shrines? The altars
themselves harbored the remains of various animals, undoubtedly offered
as sacrifices. Again, fish take an important position; most prevalent are
skeletons of the larger species: carp, sturgeon, pike, and catfish. Signifi
cantly, the fish skeletons were found whole, suggesting that they were
deposited intact as sacrifices, rather than cut up and eaten. Larger mam
mals, such as dogs and wild boar, also appear intact. Red-deer skulls and
shoulder blades make up some of the sacrifices. All of these animals belong
to the goddess of regeneration, and undoubtedly they were sacrificed to
invoke her aid.
Beneath the red limestone floors were concealed the skeletons of new
born babies, some five or six days old. Other skeletons were buried directly
outside the shrines. The skull of the deceased was set aside for special
care, often protected with a box of stones. Most of the skeletons were dis
articulated: the bones were not laid out in anatomical position as they would
have been had the individual been buried with the flesh intact. Disartic
ulated skeletal bones often indicate that interment occurred subsequent
to excamation. Thus, first the body of the deceased individual would be
exposed outside so that nature and birds of prey could deflesh the corpse;
then the bones would be buried.3
Local people brought their dead to sacred sites such as Lepenski Vir
and other sites along the Danube Gorge for rites of burial and regenera
tion. Most likely, the local inhabitants laid out their dead in front of the
shrines for excamation; bones belonging to eagles, owls, ravens, pelicans,
and magpies have been found there. (This certainly occurred at the nearby
site of Vlasac.) When the birds and elements had defleshed the bones, the
remains were buried at the shrines.
Although the Vlasac and Lepenski Vir shrines originated with Upper
Paleolithic preagriculturalists circa 11,000 b .c ., several thousand years later
the Neolithic agriculturalists, after occupying the sites for a few hundred
years, began to use the shrines. Eventually, we find Starcevo-type pottery
in the sites (from the first half of the sixth millennium b .c .), but no sub
stantial change in the symbols of the shrines or their apparent functions.
The preagricultural and agricultural peoples apparently shared the same
religious beliefs and symbolic system.
59 / The Tomb and the Womb



Uterine and Egg-Shaped Tombs
CAVES AND RO CK-CUT TOMBS
Caves, with their hidden, cool atmosphere, stalagmites, stalactites, and
underground streams, exude a mysterious quality perhaps equated to the
regeneration of life itself: the enclosed spaces of caves symbolize the birth
canal and womb of the goddess.
Scaloria cave, located near the town of Manfredonia in Foggia province,
southeast Italy (explored by the author, Shan Winn, and Daniel Shimabuku
in 1979 and 1980), provides one such example. During the sixth mil
lennium b .c ., this part of Italy supported a thriving Neolithic population
with hundreds of settlements. Scaloria cave consisted of upper and lower
sections. The upper cave resembled a wide hall. It contained habitation
remains and several graves. The lower cave was quite long and narrow,
with a number of natural features, such as stalactites and stalagmites, that
would make it attractive for ritual functions. A live stream flowed near
the bottom of the cave, where it widened. The narrow passage that guided
visitors and ritual participants toward the sacred water may have been
equated with the birth canal. Evidence collected here suggests ritual activ
ities: excavators found potsherds that once belonged to fifteen hundred
different painted vessels. The potsherd designs— eggs, snakes, plant
shoots, radiating suns, and hourglass shapes or butterflies (the goddess
herself)— symbolize regeneration. At the narrow entrance to the upper
cave, skeletons of 137 people had been buried, but in no particular order.
Most of the skeletons belonged to young women ages twenty to twenty
two years, or to children. The location of the burials, the restricted ages
and gender of the skeletons, and the natural features of the cave all sug
gest that these burials had a distinctive ritual purpose.
Caves similar to Scaloria are known from the Adriatic Coast in Dal
matia and the Peloponnesus. Their stalagmites, like phalli, exude the feel
ing of mysterious life force. Some caves include rock formations reminiscent
of human female figures. Many such caves contained Neolithic (sixth to
fifth millennium b .c .) potsherds.
In the Maltese Islands, archaeologists consider Ghajn Abul and Mixta
caves (from Gozo Island) and Ghar Dalam cave (on the main island of
Malta) the earliest ritual sites. Eventually the inhabitants of Malta, and those
of other Mediterranean areas such as southern Italy, Sardinia, and south
ern and western France, created their own underground chambers: rock
cut tombs (i.e., tombs carved from rock). The most important underground
tombs date from the fifth millennium b .c . The egg or kidney shape of their
chambers and the skeletons in a fetal position suggest the symbolic affin
ity of these tombs to the goddess’ womb. As in other Neolithic tombs, the
60 / The Tomb and the Womb



use of red, purple, and yellow ocher pigments emphasizes the womblike
quality of the tombs, and the process of regeneration. The illustrated rock
cut tomb from Cuccuru S’Arriu, Oristano, Sardinia, dating from the mid
fifth millennium b .c ., included a stiff nude-type stone figurine (Fig. 13a,
above), and an open shell dish filled with red ocher.
The Maltese Hypogeum
Around 36 0 0 b .c ., the Maltese began building one of the most remark
able prehistoric monuments, the Hal Saflieni Hypogeum (underground
tomb) located near the Tarxien temple on Malta. This remarkable monu
ment consists of at least thirty-four interconnected chambers, carved
directly out of limestone. The Hypogeum reproduces a temple under
ground, since its main hall looks like the facades of aboveground Maltese
temples. The tomb’s walls portray three upright stones holding a corbeled
vault carved in relief, implying what actual Maltese temples might have
looked like intact. Hal Saflieni was a dark and humid realm that would
have been but dimly lit by means of burning fat or olive oil. The egg shape
of the individual chambers again symbolizes the phenomenon of regen
eration. Most of the egg-shaped chambers occur on the upper level, and
these were probably dug first. They particularly resemble the rock-cut
tombs of Malta’s earlier period. Red ocher, again representing the color of
life, was diluted with water and painted on many chamber walls. Red
designs— spirals or vines resembling trees of life, and discs that perhaps
depict pomegranates, a symbol of life— decorate the middle-level halls of
the Hypogeum.
The Maltese Hypogeum illustrates the communal nature of Old Euro
pean burial rites. Excavators recovered approximately seven thousand
human bones, a phenomenal number considering the island’s small size
and its probably low population. Most bones were found in egg-shaped
niches on the lower levels. The remains exhibit no evidence of a hierar
chical social order. Human bones received equal treatment; the bones of
different individuals were mixed together, and no one was singled out for
special treatment. Grave goods do not reflect social rank but offer sym
bolic assistance to the process of regeneration. As at (latal Huyiik and Lep
enski Vir, the disordered state of the bones may indicate that they
underwent excamation before they were interred in the Hypogeum.4
Animals sacrificed in the Hypogeum— calves, kids, lambs, pigs, frogs,
rabbits, and hedgehogs— symbolically facilitated the cycle of life and regen
eration. One carefully sealed conical sacrificial pit in the main room con
tained sheep horns. Some animal remains reveal the seasonal nature of
certain regenerative rites. Roe-deer skulls with mature antler racks were
interred with the dead. The growth stage of the antlers demonstrates that
61 / The Tomb and the Womb



the deer sacrifice must have taken place in the spring, the only time when
deer grow antlers.5 So at least some burial rituals took on seasonal sig
nificance.
Excavators uncovered one of Malta’s most famous Neolithic sculptures,
the “Sleeping Lady” of the Hypogeum, off the main hall. She reclines peace
fully on her side, head in hand, in the distinctive Maltese obese-woman
style.6 This sculpture and another one shown lying on her stomach on a
couch remind us of initiation and healing rites known in later classical
times. During these various classical ceremonies, the initiate spent a night
in the temple (or cave or other remote place). The initiate experienced a
night of visions and dreams, with spiritual or physical healing taking place.
We know that such rites took place at the temple of the healing god Askle
pios at Epidauros, an ancient Greek city on the northeast coast of the Pelo
ponnesus, where a healing practice consisted of preparatory washing and
fasting, followed by a night in the temple. This rite probably derived from
Neolithic practices that likened sleeping in a cave, temple, or underground
chamber to slumbering within the goddess’ uterus before spiritual reawak
ening. For the living, such a ritual brought physical healing and spiritual
rebirth. For the dead, burial within underground chambers, shaped and
colored like the uterus, represented the possibility of regeneration through
the goddess’ symbolic womb.
The Hal Saflieni Hypogeum shares several themes with other Old Euro
pean underground tombs. First, excamation and communal burial stressed
equality, and accompanying grave goods succored life regeneration. Sec
ond, the community often aligned regenerative rites and seasonal rituals
conducted at the tombs. Finally, the uterine and egg shapes of the tombs,
with their symbolic embellishments and evidence of ritual, invoke the god
dess’ presence to speed the regeneration of life.
Sardinian Rock-Cut and Underground Tombs
As mentioned above, in the fifth millennium b.c. the Sardinian Bonu
Ighinu culture carved their tombs from rock, creating egg- or kidney
shaped chambers. During the later stages of the Neolithic, identified with
the Ozieri culture, Sardinia’s population and trade flourished. The Ozieri
people cut hundreds of tombs out of solid rock, often in dangerous ver
tical cliffs. They did not confine this amazing engineering feat to single
chambers; in fact, cutting into the mountainside they chiseled complexes
of many rooms and hallways supported by sandstone pillars. The work
manship reveals a fascinating rock rendition of wood architectural fea
tures: rafters, roof beams, pilasters, and doors with lintels.
Like many megalithic monuments in western Europe, the Sardinian
hypogea were assaulted by grave robbers ages ago. Although the burial
62 / The Tomb and the Womb



goods are long gone, the tombs themselves are well preserved and can tell
us much about the Neolithic Sardinian’s unique view of death. Sardin
ians carved one of the important Neolithic symbols of regeneration— the
bovid head, or bucranium— into many hypogea walls. Bovid-head reliefs
occur in the symbolically important position above the tomb’s entrance,
on both sides of the entrance, or elsewhere inside the tomb (Figs. 29 and
30, above). In addition to almost omnipresent bucrania and red
ocher-washed walls, within the chambers and ceiling of the hypogeum
several specific images emphasize the theme of regeneration: eyes, breasts,
owl heads, ram horns, double spirals, and/or moon-cycle symbols.
Fortunately, a few hypogea of the Ozieri culture survived the millen
nia intact. At San Benedetto, Iglesias, in southwest Sardinia, archaeolo
gists found a hypogeum that held about thirty-five skeletons. The evidence
from these intact tombs shows that the Sardinian burial practices paral
leled those found elsewhere in western Europe during the fourth millen
nium b.c. First, communal burials showed no signs of individual special
treatment. Second, disarticulated and disordered bones signal exposure
aboveground or previous burial before transportation to the underground
tomb (that is, again, they underwent excamation or previous burial). The
famous, abstractly rendered Sardinian stiff nude or white goddess sculp
tures, carved in bone, marble, or alabaster, come from the Ozieri tombs.
Although Neolithic burial evidence points to excamation in several parts
of Europe, Anatolia, and the Near East, archaeologists find it difficult to
pinpoint the exact locale where exposure took place. Old Europeans prob
ably constructed wooden platforms for this purpose. These archaeologi
cally appear only as postholes, since the wood rots. Postholes possibly
indicating such platforms are known from megalithic monument sites in
western Europe. In Sardinia, archaeologists have preserved a ten-meter
high platform built of earth and stones that may have been used for excar
nation at Monte d’Accoddi, near Alghero. This large rectangular platform
looks roughly like a pyramid with a stone foundation riveted to huge lime
stone blocks. A ramp leads toward the summit. Near the platform, archae
ologists discovered typical Ozieri stiff nude alabaster sculptures (Fig. 13b,
above), greenstone axes, loom weights, and vases richly decorated with
circles, spirals, horns, zigzags, and triangles. One intriguing artifact found
here— a dish depicting dancing women— tells us something about Old
European rituals performed for the dead (Fig. 49). The women exhibit a
form we have seen at Old European sites: an hourglass shape; their three
“toed” feet look like bird claws rather than human feet. The hourglass fig
ures on the Monte d’Accoddi dish might portray a ritual dance once
performed at the stone platform. Today we might regard joyous festivi
ties like dancing inappropriate to the observance of death, although the

Irish wake is probably a similar ritual. But many ancient cultures, includ
ing those of the European Neolithic, may have celebrated death because
it signaled the impending regeneration of life as well as reunion with the
ancestors.
The Megalithic Graves o f Western Europe
Megalithic (“large stone”) monuments, dating from the fifth to the third
millennia b.c., span Europe from Spain and Portugal in the west, through
France, Ireland, and Britain, to Denmark, Holland, northern Germany,
and southern Scandinavia. Unlike the cities of southeastern Europe, which
lay buried for thousands of years and only came to light during the last
century, the western European megaliths were observable even in Roman
times, and fantastic legends regarding them have persisted through the
ages. Although they may have been places of ritual, their main function
was funerary; many served as ossuaries: the final resting place for bones.
Several different types of megalithic monuments exist. A common type,
popularly known as a dolmen, consists of three or four large upright stones
holding a horizontal stone: the cap stone. In other monuments, “passage
graves,” large upright stones, form a passageway leading to a round or
rectangular chamber capped with other stones. The simple long rectan
gular tombs, or “gallery graves” (allées couvertes in French), are typical of
Brittany. In Ireland and the Shetland Islands are found “court tombs,” tombs
with a semicircular courtyard in front. Examples of these types are given
here (Fig. 50). Each group developed many variants during the peak era
of megalithic construction, from the mid-fifth through the fourth millen
nia b .c . The gigantic long earthen barrows of northern Europe, built in
the fourth millennium b .c . and stretching from England to Poland, usu

ally have a roughly triangular shape and cover a megalithic grave at the
wide end. This grave is often anthropomorphic in outline, as in West Ken
net in Wiltshire, England. The long barrows of northern Germany and
western Poland have a stone or wooden chamber for burials, usually at
the wider end (Fig. 51). In the Orkney Islands, north of Scotland, from
the late fourth through the third millennia, inhabitants built chambered
tombs in round or long mounds. The megalithic phenomenon lasted over
two millennia and united most of northern and western Europe in a unique
architectural representation of death and regeneration.
The megalithic tombs have intrigued people for generations, so much
so that the tombs were ransacked and robbed even in antiquity. The very
few monuments left intact preserve invaluable information regarding bur
ial practices. Like the Maltese and Sardinian tombs, the western European
megalithic burials make no distinctions based on class or gender. The col
lective burials contained no real prestige items, but instead held objects

symbolic of the great journey after death. The megalith builders practiced
both cremation and excamation, but excamation was most prevalent. As
in other European communal burials, the inhabitants first exposed the
body to birds of prey and then deposited the bones into the megalithic
tomb. The disarticulated skeletons found in the megalithic tombs often
lack small hand and foot bones. Often the skull received special attention.7
The megalithic monuments incorporated artifacts, architecture, and dec
oration that demonstrated their builders’ preoccupation with regenera
tion and death. When we envision the original forms of these stone
monuments, covered by large dirt or rock mounds, their symbolism
becomes clearer. The passage represents a birth canal leading back into
the womb, formed by the overlying mound or rock cairn. Often the pas
sage’s narrow entrance resembles a vulva. In some megaliths, the pas
sageway remains straight throughout, but in others it opens into a round
or cruciform chamber, which may have represented a uterus. The red paint
found on some Portuguese megaliths seems to reinforce this metaphor.
Many megaliths display the life-stimulating images noted in chapter 2:
horns, hooks, spirals, and phalli. The gigantic triangular shape of the
earthen long barrows seems to represent the goddess’ body Even today,
legends identify the barrows with tombs of giants or giantesses. Placing a
person’s remains within the tomb returned him or her to the goddess’
womb, from which she renewed life.
Symbols of northern European birds of prey— the owl, crow, eagle, and
raven— attest to the presence of the goddess of death and regeneration in
megalithic tombs. At Isbister on the island of South Ronaldsay, the south
ernmost of the Orkney Islands off northern Scotland, we have evidence
for rituals dedicated to the goddess as a bird of prey. Here and at other
sites on these isolated, windswept islands, excavators have come upon
megalithic tombs still intact, containing hundreds of human bones. Skele
tal analysis showed that Isbister entombed women and men in almost equal
numbers. Most of their bones were disarticulated, showing that excarna
tion took place prior to interment or that the burials were secondary Here,
as at other megalithic tombs, a bird of prey would likely embody the god
dess. At other western European megalithic shrines, we usually see the
goddess as an owl, but at Isbister her presence comes through the local
raptor: the sea eagle. The builders of Isbister entombed the carcasses of
thirty-five sea eagles with their kinfolk. These birds had been caught or
hunted and then sacrificed to the goddess of death and regeneration.
Because of the sea eagle’s unusual presence, the Isbister tomb has been
called the “Tomb of the Eagles.” Comparing the megalithic people of the
Orkney Islands to modem traditional peoples, some archaeologists spec
ulate that the eagle’s significance stems from its status as a clan totem ani
66 / The Tomb and the Womb



mal. Isbister’s sea eagle, however, more likely paralleled the owl, vulture,
and other raptors in Old Europe as a manifestation of the goddess of death and regeneration.
Other evidence from Isbister suggests that the local populace performed
rites for the dead seasonally, and that they reopened the tomb during spe
cific times of the year. Significantly, analysis showed differing degrees of
weathering on the interred bones. Some displayed long exposure to the
elements, while others exhibited little weathering. The individuals were
probably exposed to nature when they died but interred at later seasonal
ceremonies, resulting in differing periods of excarnation. Unlike the
tombs of Egyptian pharaohs or Greek warriors, megalithic monuments
were not hermetically sealed for eternity. Megalith builders often provided
some mechanism, such as a large rock, to seal off the passageway. Reopen
ing the megalithic tomb would still prove a difficult task, initiated only
when necessary to perform new burials and seasonal rituals. Afterward,
it would be resealed.
Many megalithic monuments reveal astronomical alignments that
highlight the importance of the seasonal cycle to their feasts and festivals,
and rituals of death and regeneration. Millions of modern television view
ers have witnessed the sun’s ascent on the summer solstice, the longest
day of the year, at the great stone circle of Stonehenge. Many other mega
lithic monuments and tombs show astronomical alignments, particularly
with the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year. Agricultural peoples
observed nature keenly and depended closely on the seasonal cycle. So
we can surmise that the summer and winter solstices, or spring and fall
equinoxes (when night and day are equal), heralded significant celebra
tions or rituals at the tombs.
A most dramatic winter solstice alignment occurs at the magnificent
passage tomb of Newgrange in the Boyne River Valley of Ireland (O’Kelly
1982). During midwinter, the days grow shorter, the weather grows colder,
plants lie dormant, and animals hibernate: the world seems to die. The
inhabitants of the Boyne Valley closely observed the progress of the sea
son toward spring by monitoring the sun’s position on the horizon. In the
northern hemisphere, the sun rises a few degrees farther north each day
as winter wears on. On the winter solstice, it reaches its northern zenith
over the Tropic of Capricorn, signaling that the days will soon lengthen
and grow warmer. The megalithic builders observed the exact point on
the horizon where the sun rose on the winter solstice, and they constructed
Newgrange so that its long passageway channeled the light onto the far
thest wall of the inner chamber, for a few days surrounding the solstice.8
In the architectural and astronomical alignment of Newgrange, we see
the connection of the seasonal cycle to rituals of regeneration. In north
67 / The Tomb and the Womb



em countries, winter solstice marks the turning point between the death
of the natural world and its return to life. When we liken the mound’s
passageway and chamber to the goddess’ symbolic birth canal and womb,
which sheltered the bones of the dead, we perceive the potency of that
shaft of sunlight in the dead of winter. As it struck the chamber’s inner
walls, this dynamic symbol of regeneration in the goddess’ womb estab
lished her as the intermediary between death and life.
The regeneration of life was a celebrated occasion, and the local pop
ulace often used megalithic tombs for feasts and offerings. Frequently there
was a courtyard in front of the monument and an edifice at the entrance
to the tomb. In Denmark and Sweden, completely separate structures, pre
sumed to be mortuary houses, have been discovered. Archaeologists found
food and pottery remains in front of these monuments. We can envision
certain rituals transpiring upon deposition of the dead within the monu
ment. The megalith builders also celebrated feasts or ceremonies honor
ing the dead at predetermined times during the year.
On the monuments, and on the artifacts found inside or nearby, are
carvings that depict religious symbolism. Symbols that occur on mega
lithic monuments have been cataloged and studied extensively (Twohig
1981). To visitors and scholars alike, the geometric designs may seem like
mere decoration, but when correlated with symbols at other Neolithic Euro
pean sites they take on special significance. They graphically disclose belief
in the same cycle of death and renewal evidenced in other Old European
funerary monuments.
Many of the symbols engraved on tomb walls or on kerbstones (the stones
that form a curb around the outer edge of an earthen mound) surround
ing the large Irish mounds (particularly Knowth in the Boyne Valley: Eogan
1985) appear calendric, undoubtedly reflecting the tombs’ astronomical
alignments and their seasonal rituals. The crescents, circles, zigzags, and
serpent forms suggest a preoccupation with time cycles: lunar months and
days of the waxing moon. For instance, twenty-nine to thirty serpentine
turnings suggest the number of days in a month, while thirteen to seven
teen turnings may signify the days of the waxing moon. Some engravings
look like modem sundials. Divisions into four, six, eight, and twelve sec
tions occur frequently (Brennan 1983). Apart from time-reckoning com
positions and such clearly recognizable symbols as suns and snakes, other
more abstract engravings occur. These include cup marks, circles, wavy
lines, or circles with a center dot. The action of engraving these symbols
into the stone itself must have included magical intent. It was an act of
communication with the divine power, essential to the monument builders.
Although some megalithic art is admittedly abstract, other symbols are
clearly recognizable. For instance, there are figures that show female and

owl features. A pair of eyes with an overarching brow gives the appear
ance of an owl; the figure has breasts and is adorned with a necklace. Some
times either the breasts or the necklace appear alone. The owl goddess
appears not only within the tombs but also on large individual standing
stones, termed menhirs, near a megalithic tomb in southern France. Her
round owl eyes stare from stone and bone figures deposited in megalithic
tombs of Portugal (see Figs. 11 and 12 above), and on vases from passage
graves in Denmark, Sweden, and elsewhere.
At Newgrange, the owl goddess’ round eyes, multiple beaks, and brow
ridges peer down from the ceiling. They appear in a peculiar quadrupled
design and in association with snake coils, zigzags, lozenges, and wind
ing snakes. On the entrance stone of Newgrange and kerbstone Number
52, double snake coils connected with multiple beaks replace the round
eyes. Eyes and snake coils are interchangeable on many megalithic mon
uments. Further symbolic fusions of symbols include eyes and suns, with
the sun featuring radiating rays or concentric circles with a center dot.
These symbols, so elaborately engraved on stones, evoke the goddess’
sacred power and energy however she was worshiped: as owl, snake, sun,
or moon.9
The goddess also manifests through a roughly anthropomorphic shape
engraved on passage-grave slabs and menhirs in Brittany. This form can
look like a hill or half egg; it can be a triangular or even rectangular image,
sometimes displaying a knob (a head or omphalos, a knoblike protrusion,
from Greek omphalos, “navel”) on top. Sometimes the artisan carved hair
around this image, perhaps a metaphor for the goddess’ power (Fig. 52a-c).
The image suggests the rising goddess with her power concentrated in
the omphalos. She is associated with hooks, horns, snakes, and ships, all
symbols of regeneration. This same theme occurs on the masterfully dec
orated orthostats of the Gavrinis passage grave (on an island in the Gulf
of Morbihan in Brittany). Here concentric arcs, piled on top of each other
in vertical columns, constitute her image. Concentric arcs radiating from

B.c. Concentric arcs radiate from a central vulvar opening,

a central vulva-shaped opening flank this rising “life column” (Fig. 53a).
Another image emphasizes the goddess’ rectangular shape, made up of
concentric arcs and central vulva, surrounded by a flowing stream of water
(Fig. 53b). This imagery exudes the goddess’ inexhaustible generative force,
rising from the depths of the waters.
In all of these tombs, one may feel the presence of the goddess, repre
sented in the architecture of the monuments as well as in ritual artifacts.
The goddess is present not only as she who holds the lifeless body. Within
her, within her regenerative tomb-as-womb, those who were buried
underwent transition to a new life.
Conclusions
The womb constitutes one of the most potent funerary themes of Old
Europe.10 In the Old European cyclical view of the life continuum, new
life arose from death in the spiraling pattern of birth, life, death, and rebirth.
The Old European tomb is also a womb, from which new life emanates.
Often, as in the Maltese megalithic complex at Mnajdra, the tomb-shrine
took the shape of the goddess. The shrines of Lepenski Vir (which date
from the Upper Paleolithic through the Neolithic) were triangular, evok
ing the pubic triangle, an abstraction of the goddess. The floors were made
of a red limestone and clay mixture, perhaps reflecting the blood of life.
Many Old European tombs incorporate a long central passage that may
evoke the birth canal. Many tombs took the shape of uteri or eggs, also symbols of regenera
70 / The Tomb and the Womb



tion. Caves, such as Scaloria cave in Manfredonia and Ghar Dalam cave on
the island of Malta, probably housed rituals of regeneration. Pottery left in
these caves incorporates regenerative designs, such as eggs, snakes, and
plant shoots. The inhabitants of Malta, Sardinia, and parts of France carved
tombs with egg- or kidney-shaped chambers. In these tombs, skeletons
lay in a fetal position. Stiff nude stone figurines sometimes accompanied
burials, which were communal. In the Maltese Hypogeum, excavators recov
ered approximately seven thousand human bones, mostly found in egg
shaped niches on the lower levels. The bones of different individuals were
mixed together. These tombs were not only resting places for the dead;
they also housed rituals, some with seasonal significance, others perhaps
for the purpose of healing and initiation. In Sardinia, the rock-cut tombs
of the Ozieri people also bore clear marks of regeneration: the bucranium
was carved in relief on many Sardinian hypogea walls, which were often
also washed with blood-red ocher; eyes, breasts, owl heads, ram horns,
and other symbols decorate the walls and ceilings of the hypogea as well.
These tombs too housed communal burials and figurines of stiff nude god
desses made of alabaster.
Throughout western Europe one finds megalithic monuments: dolmens,
passage graves, gallery graves, court tombs. Many of these were final rest
ing places for bones, generally after excarnation. These burials were col
lective, and the grave goods were symbolic and sacred rather than prestige
items. The bird of prey is often associated with the megaliths. At Isbister
in the Orkney Islands, thirty-five sea eagles were entombed with human
skeletons. The owl is associated with many other megalithic sites. These
are manifestations of the bird goddess of death and regeneration.
Because many of the megalithic structures are oriented to the summer
or winter solstice, it is likely that the megaliths were the sites of rituals
honoring the cycles of the seasons. These rituals would have been closely
associated with the concept of regeneration: passage tomb megaliths, used
for burials, were constructed so that when the sun rose on the solstice, it
shone through the long passageway and illuminated the farthest wall of
the inner chamber. In nonburial monuments such as Stonehenge, the sun
rises over a specific stone. At the time of the winter solstice, the longest
night of the year, this shaft of light would have been a potent symbol of
the renewal of light and, by extension, the renewal of life.
Again, Old European tombs reveal the holistic spirituality of the cul
ture. The tomb was a place of healing, both of the living and of the dead;
a place where the goddess not only held the lifeless body but regenerated
the dead into new life.

CHAPTER FOUR
Temples
M
odem archaeology has revealed that highly evolved religious beliefs
. and centers of worship— temples— existed in Europe and the Near
East more than five thousand years before the classical eras of Greece and
Rome. Religious life centered on the temple from the seventh millennium
onward. During the Neolithic period, these Old European temples har
bored a sophisticated spiritual system. Today, their remnants provide us
with artifacts and contexts to help us unravel the Neolithic sacred system
and envision the divine force in the daily lives of the people who lived in
Old Europe.
Houselike Temples o f Southeast Europe
For most people, the term temple conjures up an ornate, pillared Greek
building, such as the Parthenon, set apart from the residential district. Old
European temples have been neglected because the earliest temples exca
vated shared the same architecture as houses. Moreover, rather than being
distanced from the settlement, they were integrated into it. Although these
temples outwardly resembled houses, they contained features and arti
facts corroborating their religious use. The Old European temple featured
an altar, usually a stone or clay bench or raised platform covered with
wooden boards, placed against one wall. Excavators have found assorted
figurines prominently placed on these altars. The figurines can be quite
large and realistically detailed, or small and schematic. Some sit on min
iature thrones and chairs. The altars display ritual implements, such as
portable ceramic hearths, bowls, lamps, dishes, ladles, incense burners,
and human- or animal-shaped vases. Larger temples contain walls that
partition the interior into four or more compartments, each containing
an altar or offering place. Just as the Greeks and Romans did with their
72



temples, some Old Europeans dedicated their sacred structures to a divin
ity whose statue dominated the main room; at the Part;a temple, a temple
of the Vinca culture (circa 5000 b .c .), a life-sized sculpture of a double
headed goddess stood near the entrance.
DAILY ACTIVITIES INTEGRATED INTO RELIG IO US PRACTICE
Old European temples integrated women’s daily activities, particularly
bread baking, cloth weaving, and pottery making, into sacred practice.
Many temples contained two large artifacts used to make bread: a domed
oven and a grinding stone, or quern, for making flour. Some temples
emphasize the importance of this activity through the presence of large
pithoi, storage jars, probably for grains.
Spinning and weaving constituted other activities carried on by women
in temples. Although time has destroyed the wooden looms (except charred
pieces remaining after fires), their presence can be inferred from ceramic
loom weights. The existence of these weights implies that weavers oper
ated vertical looms. Archaeologists also commonly find spindle whorls,
used to spin thread from raw wool or other fiber, in these temples.
Old European temples have revealed many beautiful pieces of pottery,
which were apparently used in temple rituals, but the connections
between pottery and the temples transcend ritual use. Excavations have
discovered that pottery production figured prominently in temple life. Tem
ples might have a pottery workshop in a room adjoining the main room
of the temple, or on the ground floor if the building had two levels. Two
story temples became common after 500 0 b .c . They usually contained the
workshops on the ground floor and a sanctuary on the upper floor. Archae
ologists unearthed an important two-story temple near the town of Raz
grad in northeast Bulgaria (Totju Ivanov 1978)1 dating to the first half of
the fifth millennium b .c . Time eventually buckled the second story onto
the first. Second-floor artifacts included typical temple features: an altar,
temple models, many figurines, and charred vertical loom parts. The
ground floor of the temple had housed the ceramic workshop. One side
of the workshop contained a large oven for firing pottery; the other side
held a platform or work surface with instruments for decorating and pol
ishing pottery, including flint blades and delicate deer- and bird-bone
implements. In addition to the implements of the workshop, the prod
ucts of the workshop were also evidenced: several high-quality unfired
and finished ceramic vases. The excavation also yielded several flat stones
used to crush ocher into decorative pigments.
Temple models (discussed later in this chapter) show that large ground
floors with round windows (stereobates) were used mainly as ceramic work

shops (Fig. 54). Cucuteni site excavations have revealed workshop mod
els displaying three rooms with women making pottery, probably repli
cas of large temple workshops. The second floor probably held the temple
proper; we have evidence of other such two-story structures.
At Herpaly in eastern Hungary, archaeologists uncovered another two
story building that dates from 4 8 0 0 -4 7 0 0 b .c .; this building preserves
unusual evidence of ceramic workshops and other ritual activity. The sec
ond floor disclosed several large basins, some of which may have served
as ceremonial hearths, judging from their features: neat plastering, a depth
of up to one meter, and an ashlayer covering. The ground floor originally
contained three rooms, one of which also held a round basin. Large ovens
occupied the other two rooms. The ovens displayed a unique truncated
pyramid shape. Each comer was decorated with a bucranium; bucrania
also decorated the walls of the structure. Numerous exquisite biconical
vases and assorted pedestaled bowls filled all of the rooms (Fig. 55).
For the twentieth-century excavator, interpreting such “houses” pre
sents a real puzzle. Did this represent a regular dwelling filled with vases;
was it a consecrated temple; or was it an odd hybrid where daily activi
ties were considered sacred? We find such stmctures incomprehensible
because our daily activities normally are separate from our spiritual lives.
But, if we examine pottery forms and decorations, we see that they belong
to a coherent symbolic system: a system that would be unnecessary if the
exclusive purpose of the pottery were to look pretty. It seems more likely
that Old Europeans created pottery, bread, and cloth as sacred acts, as evi
denced by the proximity of the workshop to the temple itself. Our
Neolithic ancestors intimately wove their secular and sacred lives together
without ideological segregation. Art, craft, and religion were one.2

FU N CTIO N S OF TEM PLES AND RITUAL EQ UIPM ENT
Most Neolithic temples excavated so far exist in southeastern Europe. From
the outset (the seventh millennium b .c .), temple symbols consistently
denoted the goddess worshiped within. If she guided regeneration, then
the temple walls, vases, furniture, and other cult objects displayed regen
erative symbols: eggs, horns, phalli, snake coils, plant motifs, butterflies,
trees of life, bucrania, triangles, double triangles, concentric circles, ris
ing columns or snakes, and eyes: the eyes of the goddess. If she gave life
and protection, symbolic decoration included V s, chevrons, spirals, tri
lines, meanders, snake spirals, parallel line bands, and other signs linked
to the bird and snake. If she ensured fertility, the decor and equipment of
the temples showed yet another set of symbols: plants, bi-lines, spirals,
lozenges, and double images. Below, we shall explore several temples ded
icated to these different aspects of the goddess: the regeneratrix, the bird
or snake goddess, and the pregnant vegetation goddess. We shall also look
at general temple functions and equipment.
Temples Dedicated to the Goddess o f Regeneration
During the 1980s, while excavating a Vinca culture settlement dating
to around 5000 b .c ., archaeologists made a momentous discovery. At Par^a
near Timi§oara in southwestern Romania, they found two temples, one
above the other, in the center of the settlement. The temples had survived
in relatively good condition. They were rectangular, measuring 2.5 by 7
meters and 11.6 by 6 meters, respectively, and were built like the other
buildings in the settlement, with timber posts and wickerwork walls daubed
with clay. Both the earlier and the later temple included monumental clay
sculptures, fenced offering areas, portable hearths, many tablelike altars,
75 / Temples



a multitude of vases, and bucrania attached to the timber posts at the
entrance and near the statues. The rough reconstruction of the upper tem
ple (based on a drawing by the excavator Gheorghe Lazarovici from his
first report, 1989, Fig. 36) illustrates that the building was separated into
eastern and western sections. These were further divided into smaller com
partments that held altars, offering places, portable hearths, a loom, quern
stones, and other necessary ritual objects.
In the main (eastern) hall of the upper temple near the entrance, on a
podium of clay and sand more than one meter wide, towered a life-sized
statue that had one torso but two heads. Unfortunately, only one head
had survived. In the lower temple was another, disintegrated statue. We
can reconstruct the original statue by using the abundance of Vinca dou
ble-headed goddess figurines recovered from other sites. These parallels
suggest that the Part;a temple’s double-headed statue portrayed a goddess
with two aspects, possibly a mother-daughter or summer-winter pair. (The
original excavator reconstructed the lost head as that of a bull, which is
unlikely because no such parallels occur in Vinca or other Old European
figurine art.) At Parta, the archaeologist did indeed find a bucranium at
the base of the double-headed statue, but this does not mean that it was
part of the original statue. In other Neolithic temples, bucrania often occur
near the goddess’ images. For instance, in the temples at Qatal Huyuk,
Figure 5 6 . Vase shaped as an
enthroned temple goddess, richly decorated with white incisions and encrustations— M ’s, X ’s, lozenges,
triangles, and parallel lines. Grain and ash fo un d nearby suggest that grain or bread was offered to the deity. Tisza culture; early fifth

excavators unearthed bucrania or horns below the goddess’ image, and
wall paintings display a bucranium in place of the goddess’ uterus (see
Fig. 27, above). At Parça, other bucrania were attached to the timber
uprights at the entrance. This monumental clay sculpture of a double
headed goddess, in association with bucrania (symbolizing the life-giving
uterus), suggests that the temple accommodated rituals of regeneration,
as did most Çatal Hüyük temples, where the double goddess usually
appeared in relief or on temple walls.
In the 1960s, Vladimir Dumitrescu and other excavators exposed
another temple dedicated to regeneration at Câscioarele, a Danubian island
south of Bucharest. Here, the team found a two-room temple dating to
the early fifth millennium b .c . Measuring ten by sixteen meters, the tem
ple contained two clay pillars originally molded around tree trunks, and
a bench along the wall. A skeleton was found between the treelike pillars.
The clay surface of the pillars displayed angular spiral patterns. A painted
snake coil hovered above the entrance. The temple walls were painted with
regenerative symbols: red eggs, concentric circles, and snake spiral
designs. The symbolic designs of the wall painting clearly disclose its pur
pose of encouraging regeneration.
In the fifth millennium b .c ., temples in several southeast European areas
exhibited large, hollow, rectangular, anthropomorphic deities. Large vases
(some more than one meter tall), produced by the Tisza culture in south
eastern Hungary, fit this category. The best examples come from temples
of the Kôkénydomb settlement, near Hôdmezôvâsârhely, excavated by
Janos Banner from 1928 to 1944. The goddess appears from the neck of
one vase; bracelets (two parallel lines) rest on her arms, and symbols encir
cle the vase: triangles, lozenges, circles, extended M’s, and lozenge bands
with a dash in the middle (Fig. 56). Unfortunately, what the vase held
remains a mystery; perhaps it held sacred water for purification. The sym
bolic designs link this vase with the goddess of regeneration.
Temples Dedicated to the Bird or Snake Goddess
The earliest identified bird goddess temples were excavated in
Achilleion, a Sesklo settlement in northern Greece, dating from the early
sixth millennium b .c ., excavated by the author along with Daniel
Shimabuku, Shan Winn, and others in 1 9 7 3 -7 4 . We uncovered several
consecutive temples, built atop one another, in the center of the settle
ment. These contained two rooms: a ceramic workshop and the temple
proper. The altar displayed bird goddess figurines (complete or composed
only of cylindrical necks with beaked heads). The temple’s painted pot
tery was richly decorated with the bird goddess’ symbols: “Vs, beaks,

nia dating to the sixth millennium b .c ., the excavator, Miodrag Grbic, found
clay temple models. Several of these models are topped with chimney
shaped hollow cylinders depicting the mask of the bird goddess; on the
sides of the walls are inverted T-shaped entrances.
Archaeologists uncovered a well-preserved snake goddess temple at
Sabatinivka, an early Tripolye (Cucuteni) settlement near Ulyanovsk, dat
ing from circa 4 8 0 0 -4 6 0 0 b.c.3 This building measured approximately
70 square meters. An altar bore thirty-two armless ceramic female figurines
78 / Temples



with snake heads, each seated on its own miniature homed-back chair.
One of them held a snake. An oven stood near the altar with a figurine
placed on it, and five grinding stones sat on the floor in front of the altar,
each accompanied by a figurine. The Sabatinivka temple highlighted an
artifact not found at other sites: a large, ceramic horned-back chair next
to the altar, facing into the room. Originally, wooden planks probably cov
ered the chair, and we can surmise from the chair’s proximity to the altar
that the overseer of the temple rituals sat there. (Other temples possibly
possessed similar chairs made of wood; these would have decayed.) Intrigu
ingly, the chairs occupied by the altar figurines looked like the full-sized
chair next to the altar, suggesting that miniature furniture imitated the
furniture of the life-sized temples.
Another hollow anthropomorphic female figurine typical of the fifth
millennium b .c . came to light at Toptepe, a tell near the Sea of Marmara
in eastern Thrace, during excavations conducted in 1989 by Mehmet
Ózdogan (Fig. 57).4 The large rectangular body (85 centimeters high) com
bines a deity and a vessel in one. The temple, which had been consumed
by flames, originally measured 7.5 by 3.1 meters. It probably contained
two rooms and dated from around 5000 b .c . (based on several radiocar
bon dates). The excavators found the vessel in the center of the main room
near the large raised platform from which it had apparently toppled. A
domed oven with an ash pit was situated west of the platform. Burnt grain
and organic ash were scattered between the platform and the oven, sug
gesting grain or bread offerings. Upon the vessel, a goddess was painted
in red with horizontal bands of zigzags, chevrons, vertical lines, mean
dering snakes, and spirals or snake coils. Rows of tiny triangles, perhaps
imitating snake scales, girdle her upper body. Parallel lines mark her arms
and zigzag bracelets adorn her wrists. This paradoxical combination of
symbols points to either the bird or snake goddess.
Temples Dedicated to the Pregnant Vegetation Goddess
The pregnant goddess consecrated grain cultivation and bread baking.
She was worshiped in the open and in temples. The author’s excavations
at Achilleion in Thessaly confirmed that at around 6000 b .c . the devotees
of the goddess venerated her in an outdoor sacred space. In this fenced
courtyard, we discovered a stone altar, a bread oven, a large hearth, and
a clay platform with offering pits in the comers. This area also contained
pregnant figurines and ritual pottery: stout vases with upraised arms. Else
where, pregnant goddess temple models and actual temples establish that
the Hamangia culture on the Black Sea coast (from the early fifth millen
nium b .c .) and the Cucuteni culture in Moldavia (from circa 40 0 0 b .c .)
worshiped her.5 The Cucuteni temple model from Ghelae§ti-Nedeia

General Temple Functions
A temple from Vésztô-Mâgor, a Tisza site in eastern Hungary, excavated
by K. Hegedüs from 1972 to 1976, provides a rare glimpse into Old Euro
pean religious life (Fig. 58). The temple walls (13 meters long and 5.3 to
5.5 meters wide) revealed a framework of wooden posts interspersed with
branch wattling daubed with clay, forming walls about twenty centime
ters thick. Remarkably, in some places, walls up to seventy centimeters
high survived. Wooden planks protected the exterior of the walls, while
their inside surface was plastered and painted with red stripes. Plaster had
been carefully applied to the dirt floor and had been renewed three or
four times. The one-meter-wide doorway faced west. A wooden-post par
tition divided the temple into two rooms. The larger eastern room con
tained bone tools, polishing stones, loom weights, stone implements, and
fired and unfired clay cones. These demonstrate that the temple served
as a weaving and tool manufacturing locale. Both temple rooms contained
a rimmed hearth, plastered onto the floor, perhaps used for fumigation
or purification.

its legs, face, and an arm were found widely scattered.) Attempted recon
structions suggest either a sculpture seated on a throne or a hollow ves
sel related to the Toptepe containers described above, as well as statues
from another Tisza site in southeastern Hungary, Kokenydomb. A large,
rimmed, four-legged table about ten to twelve centimeters high stood near
the statue. On top of the table, a rectangular container held a charred deer
antler. A decorated jug, with a lid that looked like an open-beaked bird,
stood nearby. The jug was incised with several symbols: a net, lozenge,
checkerboard, and V or triangular design. Crushed white chalk filled the
incisions, along with traces of red paint. Two side knobs exhibited triple
protrusions. Several large vases, a rectangular three-legged offering con
tainer, and consecration horns on a flat base stood near the table. A reed
mat rested on the ground near a kem os, a ring-shaped clay container with
two small cups and two pairs of horns attached to the rim. In addition,
excavators uncovered a cup, a clay disc, a flint blade, stone chisels, charred
cattle bones, and a clay bird head similar to one found on the lid of the
decorated jug mentioned above. Altogether, this room possessed about
forty cult objects, not counting other ritual items such as charred animal
bones, deer antlers, and fish scales. Although we cannot exactly recon
struct the rituals performed here, the evidence points to various ceremo
nial activities involving grain offerings, sacred garments, animal sacrifice,
and libations, fumigations, or purifications.
Other Ritual Equipment
Various artifacts further illuminate the rich ceremonial life of Old Euro
pean temples. These include lamps, ladles, kemoi, incense burners, liba
tion vases, vase supports, three- and four-legged tables, assorted offering
containers, portable clay hearths, and clay horn stands or “horns of con
secration” (Figs. 59a-d, 60, and 7, above). Many small containers show
possible char marks, suggesting that temple adherents burned incense and
oil lamps during temple rituals.
A major artifact group specifically held liquids. Bird-shaped vases (askoi)
with beaked spouts appear in the early Neolithic and endure until the
demise of the Minoan culture. Archaeologists have unearthed several par
ticularly fascinating seated nude female figures, each of which holds a bowl.
They may portray spiritual cleansing and lustration, or the bowls may have
held a liquid offering to the temple deity. The same symbols observed on
sculptures of the goddess— tri-lines, chevrons, and meanders— also
appear on these figurines. The great number of decorated clay ladles, pos
sibly used in sacred food and drink offerings, corroborates the ritual use
of water, milk, or other liquids. Breasts, or figurines with breasts, deco
rate some bowls (Fig. 61).

CLAY TEM PLE MODELS
Miniature clay temple models, unique to southeastern Europe, offer
“archaeological snapshots” of ancient temple buildings and rituals. These
artifacts can be small enough to hold in the palm of one’s hand, but usu
ally they range from twenty to fifty centimeters long. More than one hun
dred models have been uncovered from an area spanning Greece to
Ukraine. These temple models not only corroborate evidence found in
actual temple excavations but offer additional clues to deciphering the
meaning of the temples.
Excavators have unearthed models in temples, in graves, and under
house or temple foundations. Their simplest forms resemble rectangular
houses, with floors, four walls, large entrances, and steeply pitched roofs.
Although the models are shaped like dwellings, their symbolic decora
tion reveals their religious nature. Sesklo models dating from 6000
through 58 0 0 b .c . display red-on-white painted designs with geometric
motifs (checkerboards and triangles) also found on vases and figurines
(Fig. 62a). Models dating to the fifth millennium b .c . exhibit sweeping
painted meanders, spirals (Fig. 62b), concentric circles (Fig. 62c), and
other symbolic designs. Interestingly, these cultures often painted their
actual temples but not their houses.
Some models display incisions suggestive of bird plumage, as well as
bird goddess symbolism. These models may not be exact temple replicas
but a coalescence of structure and religious expression, perhaps manifesting
the goddess in one of her forms. The shapes and decorations of the mod
els create a clearly avian impression: the model looks like a birdhouse, an
actual bird, or a combination of both.

Examples from Macedonia, on the Balkan Peninsula, strikingly illus
trate the sacred nature of the temple models. As discussed above, there
were several models excavated by Miodrag Grbic at Porodin, a site near
Bitola, just north of the Greek border. These look like normal houses with
four walls, a floor, and a pitched roof. But in the center of the roof sits a
chimneylike cylinder that bears a molded mask resembling those found
on bird goddess figurines; these masks have the purpose of invoking or
representing the bird goddess. The chimneylike cylinder represents the
goddess’ neck, while the temple itself depicts her body. Moreover, the tem
ple goddess wears a necklace: beads embossed on the roof of the model
circle the deity’s “neck.”
A temple model dating to around 5000 b.c., from Slatino in western
Bulgaria, shows a frog stretched across the roof with its head above the
entrance. Frog’s eggs mark the animal’s body (Fig. 63). This impressive
model must have exemplified a temple dedicated to the frog goddess’ life
giving or regenerative aspects.
Some models lack roofs, attracting our attention inside the temple. Here
we see a microcosm of temple life: the altar near its bread oven and fenced
offering area. One Cucuteni open model from Popudnya in western Ukraine
imparts a most remarkable picture of Old European temple ritual. Besides
the small altar, oven, storage jars, and grinding stones, we see two human
figurines, both female. One stands next to the bread oven and the other
kneels at the grinding stone, processing flour (Fig. 64). In this model, we
are shown what archaeologists rarely encounter: representations of people
actually performing religious activities. This clearly demonstrates that daily
life and religious life are one.
An artisan from the Dimini culture of the early fifth millennium b.c.
crafted another temple model containing figurines that may suggest a hier
archical order among temple priestesses or other ritual performers.6 The

horizontal lines around her flounced skirt. Parallel lines decorated her arms
and zigzag lines crossed over her shoulders in back. Three smaller, more
schematic figurines exhibited no symbolic markings. The smallest and most
abstract figurines surrounded the bread oven. The symbols of the largest
figurine typify the bird goddess, known from hundreds of other Neolithic
images. This ornamented figurine represents either the main priestess
supervising the rituals or the bird goddess herself. The medium-sized stat
uettes may represent her assistants, and the smallest ones may be helpers
or children, perhaps preparing sacred bread. Excavators came upon this
model under the floor of a building, perhaps deposited there to honor the
bird goddess upon construction of her temple. Unfortunately, archaeolo
gists did not excavate the building itself, but only probed a small square
86 / Temples



within Zarkou tell to determine stratigraphy and habitation sequence. The
purpose of this building remains a mystery.
In 1987, E. J. Peltenburg and his team brought to light a remarkable
model at Kissonerga-Mosphilia, Cyprus, that reproduces temple rituals
related to childbirth. This open model, found in a pit sealed by a collapsed
wall, dates to the Cypriot Chalcolithic (around 30 0 0 b.c.). The model du
plicates a round building with a rectangular opening. Its red exterior and
interior shows square, zigzag, and checkerboard designs. Inside, the model
contained fifty objects, including pestles, pounders, pebbles, rubbing
stones, a polisher, a flint blade, a conch shell, a four-legged altar, a pierced
terra-cotta cone (perhaps a loom weight), and nineteen stone and clay fig
urines (mostly female). But the most exciting terra-cotta figurine shows
a woman giving birth: from between her legs (broken off during eons under
dirt) a child’s painted head and arms emerge. The birth-giving figurine
sits on a chair, perhaps a birth stool (unfortunately badly damaged).7 She
appears rather stiff and schematic, with arm stumps and a thick cylin
drical neck topped by a round mask. The birth giver wears a red-painted
neck pendant. Other schematic figurines in this tableau possess cylindri
cal necks and outstretched or folded arms; some stand, while others sit.
They may portray various attendants in the birth-giving ritual. The tools
(pestles, pounders, polisher, loom weight, etc.) indicate that temple
birthing ceremonies required intricate preparations, such as preparing
grain, weaving cloth, and making pottery.
This unique temple model confirms that birth took on sacred over
tones associated with the temple and the goddess’ life-giving functions.
We know that birth rituals took place throughout the Neolithic: birthing
figurines were found in the Maltese temples of Mnajdra (circa 30 0 0 b.c.)
and Tarxien (3300 to 2500 b.c.), and birthing images were painted at the
Red Shrine of Catal Huyiik, dating to circa 7000 b.c.
Temple models also tell us something about temple architecture. A par
ticular Cucuteni model found at the Rozsokhuvatka site near Kiev,
Ukraine, consists of a two-story temple (Fig. 66). As mentioned earlier,
archaeologists have uncovered actual two-story temples with the sacred
space on the second floor and the ceramics workshop on the first. Another
model excavated on the island of Cascioarele, Romania, presents four small
temples situated atop a larger substructure and suggests that some tem
ples may have been built on a monumental scale.
We can only begin to speculate why these Old Europeans created minia
ture temple worlds. The actual temple locations of the models reveal their
religious nature. Their exterior and interior designs further strengthen this
conclusion because real temples show similar decoration. Moreover, bird
plumage adornments, bird goddess symbolism, and a recurring bird

houselike shape signify a strong connection between the models and the
bird goddess as protectress, nourisher, and healer. Still other models exhibit
regenerative symbols (suns, snakes, eggs, spirals, and concentric circles).
As with genuine temples, the models must have been dedicated to a num
ber of deities. The Old European linear script found on some of them may
indicate the donor’s or deity’s name.
M IN IA TU R ES
Another curious group of artifacts provides additional insights into tem
ple ritual: miniature furnishings. Old European temples undoubtedly con
tained full-sized ritual furniture and implements. Burial for millennia,
however, destroyed most of these perishable wood and cloth objects. But
the Old Europeans created miniature ceramic furnishings that have sur
vived at some sites. At the Sabatinivka temple, mentioned above, snake
goddess figurines were found seated on miniature chairs that imitated a
full-sized ceramic chair in the same temple. The Ovcarovo site in Bulgaria,
dating from the mid-fifth millennium b.c., revealed small drums, thrones,
stools, tables, and altar screens within a temple model. Based on this and
other evidence, we can assume that these clay models imitated full-sized
furnishings and ritual implements. The drums, for instance, suggest that
some temple rituals included music.
The miniatures may have created tableaux on the temple altar to fur
ther supplicate the deities by providing them with domestic comforts. They
also may have been used to reenact rituals. In Old European temples,
adherents may have effected rituals in two stages: both personal drama
tization and commemoration of the rite with miniatures.
CEREM ONIAL COSTUMES
Occasionally, figurines bear markings that clearly indicate clothing,
bequeathing a wealth of costume detail. The Vinca culture in the Danube

River basin, from the end of the sixth through the fifth millennia b.c., left
the most informative costumed figurines. These images bear deep inci
sions encrusted with white paste or red ocher emulating fringe, hip belts,
aprons, narrow skirts, and sleeveless upper-body panels. The Vinca arti
sans also modeled a variety of shoes, caps, hairstyles, bracelets, necklaces,
and medallions.
Figurines with clothing and ornaments appear either bare-breasted or
fully clad. Several dress combinations recur persistently on bare-breasted
images. Some wear only a hip belt (Fig. 67) or a hip belt supporting either
an apron or an entire fringed skirt (Fig. 6 8 a -b ).8 Others wear a tight skirt
and nothing else (Fig. 69). Hip belts were made of string, textile, or leather;
large buttons or discs often gird them entirely. On most clothed figurines,
the incised blouse looks like several vertical panels of material sewn
together. The simple V-neck in front and back results from a gap in the
middle seam; the garment is sleeveless (Fig. 70). A number of figurines
show black-painted panels over the shoulders and torso in front and back.
The skirt, which generally begins below the waist and hugs the hips,
exhibits decorative white-encrusted incisions with dots, zigzags, net pat
terns, or checkerboards (Fig. 71). The skirt narrows below the knee, and
may have been slit in front. Some figurines wear leg wrappings. This skirt
type gives the impression of constraining movement. Very likely such fig
urines portray priestesses in some ritual act, such as offering gifts to the
goddess. Nude figurines with just hip belts or necklaces may portray par
ticipants in other types of rituals, perhaps dances.
Some figurines model hairstyles and headgear. Hairstyles received much

Medallions have long been a favorite form of adornment; the earliest
known examples of medallions come from the Sesklo culture in Greece.
The author’s excavation at Achilleion IV (5 8 0 0 -5 7 0 0 b .c .) unearthed a
figurine from a temple, adorned with front and back medallions. A round
medallion attached to a necklace or V-shaped collar, shown on another
female sculpture found in a temple, may symbolize her religious status or
position. Medallions on important figurines appear throughout several
millennia.
Stone Temples o f Malta
The ancient cultures of the Maltese archipelago left some of the most mag
nificent Neolithic temples and artwork; their natural environment inspired
their building traditions. The islands consist of coralline and globigerina
limestone: materials easily quarried and sculpted but quite durable. Using
these materials, the Neolithic Maltese expressed their religious beliefs. They
created numerous megalithic temples at Ggantija, Hagar Qim, Mnajdra,
and Tarxien (Figs. 73 and 74). As discussed in chapter 3, they constructed
the remarkable Hal Saflieni Hypogeum, with its many levels and cham
bers. They also sculpted statues, such as the life-sized Tarxien temple god
dess (Fig. 75), which date from the fourth and early third millennia b .c .
These ancient peoples built huge temples, such as that at Ggantija on
the island of Gozo, constructed of limestone blocks weighing up to fifty

tons. They carefully dressed the limestone into gently curving shapes that
define the Maltese style of Neolithic art. Unlike the temples of southeast
ern Europe, which externally resembled other residences within settle
ments, the Maltese temples displayed a distinctive monumental architecture
that only could have expressed religious purposes. A stone wall often sep
arates these temples from their surroundings. Here the sacred stands apart.
94 / Temples



The curved lines of the temples are derived from the lobed rock-cut tombs
and not from square house plans as in southeastern Europe. The earliest
Maltese temples, dating from the fifth to fourth millennia b.c. (for exam
ple, Red Skorba), are three-lobed structures radiating off a central court
entered through a passage.
Early Maltese temples have an egg shape evocative of the goddess’
womb. Later temples, dating from the fourth to the third millennia b .c .
(for example, Ggantija, Mnajdra, and Tarxien), have four or five semicir
cular projections off the main room, creating an architectural design imi
tative of the goddess’ body. Indeed, the Maltese sculptures of female figures,
often called “fat ladies,” mirror the temples’ shape. Temple forecourts are
circular or elliptical, creating a concave facade that focuses on the tem
ple’s trilithon entrance. Huge perforated stones, which have been found
in the forecourts of several temples, may have been used to tether sacri
ficial cattle.
Like their southeast European counterparts, the Maltese temples were
used for specific religious functions, particularly for rituals of death and
regeneration. Maltese temples intriguingly occur in pairs, with one tem
ple larger than the other. This can be interpreted in several ways: as rep
resenting death and regeneration, maturity and youth, or winter and spring.
The temple pairs could also exemplify a mother-daughter twosome, such
as that in ancient Greece exemplified by Demeter and Persephone. Fig
urines representing a double goddess flourish from the sixth and fifth mil
lennia b .c . throughout Old Europe and (latal Htiyuk in Anatolia. The link
between double temples and double goddesses also occurs in Malta. In
1992, at the Brochtorff Circle in Xaghra, Gozo, excavators discovered a
stone statue of two goddesses joined at the hip and seated on a couch.
The statue measures twenty by twenty centimeters; its weight centers in
the goddesses’ prominently rounded, egg-shaped hips. Like all other related
figurines found in the Hagar Qim and Tarxien temples, the Xaghra dou
ble goddesses have no breasts.9 One goddess’ head shows neatly combed
hair, but the other’s head is lost. Significantly, one goddess holds a minia
ture figurine reflecting the same kind of double goddess, and the other
grasps a cup (Fig. 76). The miniature figurine quite likely symbolizes
reemerging new life.
The temple pairs may also suggest different seasonal aspects of polar
ity. The western temples seem larger and contain more religious artifacts
and furniture. Originally, the western temples were stuccoed or painted
red, the color of life and regeneration. The temples themselves were built
of darker, brownish-red limestone. All this suggests that the western tem
ples, which faced the setting sun, supported rituals of death and regen
eration. The east, by contrast, represented the rising sun and new life. The

Gozo).
smaller eastern temples were airy and more open and constructed of paler
limestone. They likely accommodated rituals of birthing and spring
regeneration.
Ggantija, on the island of Gozo, is one of the most suggestive double
temples. A limestone block wall, in some places six meters high, encir
cles both temples. Some of Ggantija’s limestone blocks weigh fifty tons,
representing an incredible engineering feat. Different rituals took place in
the apses off the main rooms of the two temples; some of the stone fur
niture provides a glimpse of their nature. Apse 5 of the larger temple con
tained a large ritual basin about one meter across and a pillar carved in
low relief with a snake. Apse 6 seems to have served as a triple shrine,
having three altar tables and a trapezoidal slab set on edge. This shrine
held several limestone blocks with several interwoven spirals engraved in
low relief. Apse 2 contained a red-painted niche and also held several lime
stone blocks showing interlinked spirals carved in low relief. The differ
ent items of furniture, symbolic relief carvings, shape suggestive of a
regenerative triangle, and red coloring of the artifacts all suggest that wor
shipers honored death and regeneration in the Ggantija temple.
Mnajdra, on the southern coast of the main island of Malta, offers
another glimpse into Maltese double temples. Unlike other double tem
ples, the Mnajdra shrines almost match each other in size, although the
western temple displays more elaborate architecture, with many niches
and a hard torba floor. Artifacts found at this temple again suggest death,
regeneration, and birthing themes. A conical stone phallus, seventy-five
centimeters in height, stands near the entrance. In Apse 4, several pecu
96 / Temples



liar clay objects occur, including some in a twisted shape resembling a
human embryo. Figurines portrayed in the birth-giving posture again rein
force the birthing theme. It appears that at Mnajdra, rituals were for the
benefit of healing and childbirth.
The Tarxien complex represents one of Malta’s last great temples. The
Tarxien temples preserve numerous relief carvings, ritual artifacts, and other
remains that further illustrate the spiritual life of the Neolithic populace.
Archaeologists have excavated many altars, as well as pottery, animal horns,
and stone and clay basins. Relief carvings on altars and stone blocks dis
play animals and plants. Among the images etched in stone, we can see
a dog with thirteen pups, and a ram, pig, and four goats in procession.
One wall depicts very impressive bulls with large horns. A multitude of
cattle, sheep, or goat bones and horns attest to their presence as ritual sac
rifices. On stone blocks are spirals and plant spirals in relief. These may
symbolize the energies of plants and snakes, and the cyclical regeneration
of life. The Tarxien complex also revealed ritual paraphernalia, such as
stone cups, probably used in celebration or libations. A famous Maltese
Neolithic statue known as “Our Lady of Tarxien,” which originally stood
between 2.5 and 3 meters tall, dominated one courtyard. Unfortunately,
the top half of the statue was carried off long ago. The bottom half, how
ever, portrays the plumpness characteristic of Maltese Neolithic sculptural
tradition (Fig. 75, above).
Around 25 0 0 b.c., these Neolithic Maltese architectural and sculptural
traditions ceased, after enduring for nearly two thousand years. The suc
ceeding peoples, the Tarxien Cemetery culture, cremated their dead and
worshiped the goddess, but they did not build the extraordinary temples
described in this section.
Conclusions
Based upon the evidence described so far, we can begin unraveling the
role of the Old European temple, and we can reconstruct its rituals and
activities. The Neolithic Europeans dedicated their temples to a deity and
performed rituals associated with the functions of this deity Certain themes
emerge: birth, the renewal of life after death or winter, and continuing
fertility for humans, animals, and the earth. The temple goddess’ image
appears as a wall relief, a large, hollow anthropomorphic vase, or a grand
sculpture standing on a podium. The temple’s interior housed one or sev
eral altars, tables, chairs, ovens, portable ceramic hearths, and fenced offer
ing places. Offerings included food, drink, cloth, garments, incense, and
temple models.
The temple epitomizes two points essential to understanding Old Euro
97 / Temples



pean religion. First, religion and daily life intimately merged. Many arti
facts commonly found in temples— looms, bread ovens, and grinding
stones— reflect mundane objects necessary to maintain life, but we can
surmise that they manifested sacred meaning within the temple. Abstruse,
arcane rituals did not take place here. The temple sanctified everyday activ
ities. In fact, the location of the temple among dwellings further strength
ens the connection between the temple and everyday life. In Old Europe,
and throughout much of prehistory, people did not separate the sacred
from the mundane. The sacred force imbued every activity.
Second, women’s activities took on sacred meaning. In most societies,
women grind grain, weave cloth, bake bread, and make pottery. This gen
dered labor division occurs almost universally, since these functions can
be carried out while raising children. We can assume that Old Europe also
adhered to a gendered labor division; it survived classical times in the
Mediterranean area and remains with many agricultural societies today.
Drastic cultural transformation eventually caused the devaluation of
“women’s work” and its removal from the spiritual sphere. In the Old Euro
pean temple we see the original sacredness of women’s activities. The tem
ple evidence confirms the strong position of these groups of Neolithic
women. Perhaps we can even say that the temple belonged to the realm
of women, who both supervised and participated in its rituals.
In Neolithic Europe, we have no clear archaeological evidence that men
took part in temple activities. But Minoan frescoes and other findings tell
us that men actively participated in many rituals. Although we have not
yet found direct confirmation of the presence of men in temples, no doubt
theyjoined in ritual life, particularly in dancing. Animal-masked male fig
urines appear in dancing posture and as musicians. Although it appears
that women played a more dynamic part in temple activities, both men
and women must have shared life’s everyday sacredness.

CHAPTE R FIVE
Sacred Stone and Wood Ceremonial Centers
he Old Europeans invested tremendous effort in constructing huge
enclosures that may have served as ritual centers for a village or clan
group. These ceremonial centers— henges (roundels), square enclosures,
and causewayed enclosures— were surrounded by ditches and often
fences or “palisades.” Several factors give evidence that these enclosures
were ritual centers: the ritual nature of artifacts found in these enclosures;
quantities of wild and domestic animal bones, which indicate feasting;
and ritual or sacrificial burials. It would seem that the rituals contained
within the enclosures honored both the dead and the goddess of death and regeneration.
There is further evidence for the fact that these enclosures served a rit
ual purpose. The enclosures reflect cooperation between the village and
clan groups, who worked collectively. Researchers have computed impres
sive construction figures that support the theory that the enclosures served
the collective community. For instance, the labor estimate on the Sarup
enclosure in Denmark (as calculated by Andersen 1988) is as follows: ditch
digging alone required 985 workdays, and the whole project took nearly
4 ,000 workdays. But 167 people working together could have completed
the site in three months. It is possible that the people worked in concert
to honor their collective ancestors, as well as the goddess.
Most activities likely flowed from an all-pervading belief in the cycli
cal nature of life. Certain findings in British enclosures, such as clean grain,
hazelnuts, and crab apples, signify the use of the monuments in autumn
or after harvest; thus seasonal rituals were most likely performed within
the enclosures.
These enclosures transformed the Old European landscape. In England,
circular ceremonial structures of wood or stone, surrounded by banks and
ditches, were termed henges. Outside of England they were called cause
99



wayed enclosures or roundels. Everywhere, they have inspired awe for thou
sands of years. In fact, one such monument, Stonehenge, in southern
England, might possibly be the most famous Neolithic monument in exis
tence. For most of the twentieth century, archaeologists operated under
the assumption that henges occurred only in the British Isles. During the
last two decades, new archaeological evidence has refuted this; further,
evidence has shown that these enclosures were used for rituals.
These monuments first emerged around 5000 b .c . in central Europe,
where the local cultures continued constructing them during the fifth and
fourth millennia b .c . Only later do we find them in Britain, where most
henge monuments date from the third millennium b .c . Again, as archae
ological methods and theories have improved, archaeologists have come
to believe that the purpose of the henges was religious and social, not
military.
By historical times, legend and superstition had veiled this Old Euro
pean monumental tradition. Consequently, no surviving customs or writ
ten records can elucidate the original function of the monuments. Their
architecture and artifacts, however, provide us with some interpretive
threads to unravel their meaning.
Roundels
The term roundel (from the German word Rondel, meaning round struc
ture) currently is used to name large stone circular monuments of central
Europe. A roundel includes a circular area surrounded by a ditch and a
bank, broken at one, two, or four places by entrances. Roundels vary in
size, from smaller henges measuring ten to twenty meters in diameter, to
enormous monuments exceeding three hundred meters in diameter.
Some roundels originally sheltered timber and stone structures within their
perimeters. Although the term roundel is not commonly used for compa
rable British monuments, it is entirely appropriate to do so. About one
hundred henge monuments alter Britain’s countryside alone, including the
famous Stonehenge, Woodhenge, and Avebury roundels, as well as the
more recently excavated Marden, Mount Pleasant, and Durrington Walls
(conveniently summarized by Geoffrey Wainwright in The Henge Monu
ments, 1989). Although archaeologists have discovered fewer central
European roundels than British ones, many central European excavations
were in process during the research and writing of this book. Though British
roundels date to much later than the central European prototypes (the
last British ones were built nearly two thousand years after the earliest
central European ones), they nevertheless belong to the same ceremonial
monument tradition.

CENTRAL EUROPEAN ROUNDELS
Several central European Neolithic cultures constructed roundels. These
include the Lengyel culture of the Middle Danube Basin; the Linear
bandkeramik (LBK) culture of Bohemia (also called the Linear Pottery cul
ture), in central and southern Germany; the Michelsberg culture of the
Upper and Middle Rhine Basin; and the Trichterbecherkultur (also called
the Funnel-necked Beaker culture, usually abbreviated as TBK or TRB) of
East Germany (the Tragtbaegerkultur in Denmark). The Lengyel culture
built the first roundels in the early fifth millennium b .c ., and the Michels
berg and Funnel-necked Beaker cultures continued the tradition through
out the fifth and fourth millennia b .c .
As the name roundel implies, Neolithic builders modeled the roundels
on a near-perfect circle, carefully drawing their outline with a rope held
fast at the center of the formation. A ditch, with a wooden fence or “pali
sade” immediately inside, surrounded the roundel. The roundel usually
opened to the four cardinal directions: north, south, east, and west. Cen
tral European roundels vary in size from 40 to 240 meters across. With
very few discrepancies, they are oriented along the same cardinal points
(north-south, east-west); this demonstrates that the builders recognized
sky and star pointers. The architects obviously wanted to correctly chart
the alignments of cardinal directions, particularly with the azimuths of the solar equinox.
Some archaeologists have assumed that the ditches and fences of the
roundels held back an enemy, and so they have termed them “fortified
settlements.” The term fortified settlements implies that the enclosed area
contained permanent dwellings. But in reality, the central area of the
roundels lacks postholes and other dwelling evidence common to settle
ments. Furthermore, no cemeteries have been excavated in roundels. On
the basis of current evidence, the monuments are, like the henges, best
interpreted as having social and religious, not military, purposes. Since
the gated entrances of most roundels open to the four cardinal directions,
we can envision their use in seasonal rituals; this orientation would serve
no defensive function. Other evidence uncovered near or within the
roundels and their ditches implies cultic activities. These finds include
unusual burials; large quantities of vases, axes, flints, and figurines; and
evidence for offerings, ritual burial or sacrifices, and feasting.
An excellent example of a central European roundel comes from
Bucany near Tmava, southwestern Slovakia, in the Middle Danube Basin.1
Radiocarbon analysis dated it to the second quarter of the fifth millen
nium b .c . Two concentric ditches encircle Bucany; the radius of the outer
ditch measures 67 to 70 meters. The ditches show a V cross section where
101 / Sacred Stone and Wood Ceremonial Centers



cut into the ground, and they measure up to 3 meters wide. The wooden
post palisade occupies the interior of the inner ditch. Four gates greeted
the four cardinal directions. Wooden structures, perhaps towers, origi
nally occupied these openings. The northeast sector once held an unusual
rectangular building measuring 15 by 7.5 meters. The building followed
a north-south alignment and did not obstruct either the north-south or
the east-west axes of the roundel, or its center. This attention to detail fur
ther suggests the ritual importance of the cardinal directions. Bucany’s orig
inal users left several artifacts that suggest the roundel’s religious nature,
including anthropomorphic (human-shaped) and zoomorphic (animal
shaped) figurines deposited in pits. The anthropomorphic images are sim
ilar to early Lengyel figurines often found in settlements; they have large,
egg-shaped buttocks, arm stumps, unique hairstyles, and traces of red
paint.
Tesetice-Kyjovice in Moravia reveals the ritual activities of the roundels
(Podborsky 1985; 1988). A ditch that had four gates oriented in the car
dinal directions formed the outer boundary of the monument; the enclosed
area measured 145 by 125 meters. A roundel in the center of the ditch
measured about 50 meters in diameter and consisted of several palisades
set inside another ditch; each palisade opened to the four directions. Exca
vators found an abundance of ritual evidence. They uncovered 3 1 4 early
Lengyel-style figurines, 153 inside the central roundel and the rest either
outside of it or in the outer ditch. Most important, in the central part of
the roundel, excavators exposed a large ritual pit that included fragments
of a Lengyel sculpture of a goddess about forty centimeters tall; ceramic
vases painted in yellow, white, and red; and a human skull. Another pit
also contained a human skull. Six more pits were found northwest of the
inner roundel, one of which contained a young woman’s skeleton buried
in a contracted position. Her skull had been removed and buried under
the wall of a grain pit. We do not know if this woman was buried in honor
after a natural death or ritually sacrificed during harvest rites.
Additional ritual burial evidence came to light during excavations of
another Lengyel roundel, built at Friebritz in eastern Austria 10.5 kilo
meters southeast of Laa an der Thaya. The two concentric ditches, 140
meters in diameter, yielded a highly unusual burial. In the very center of
the roundel, where its four cardinal directions intersect, excavators found
two skeletons: one of a man twenty to thirty years old and one of a woman
about twenty years old. They rested stomach-down, one above the other,
with the female skeleton on top. Several trapeze-shaped flint arrowheads
lay at the shoulders of both skeletons (Neugebauer 1986).
The Michelsberg culture, which flourished along the Rhine River, also
built roundels that contained atypical ritual burials. Archaeologists have
102 / Sacred Stone and Wood Ceremonial Centers



unearthed these burials in pits outside of or at the bottom of the ditch
encircling the roundel. The Bruchsal-“Aue” roundel northeast of Karlsruhe
provides evidence for several ritual burials. The excavators found most
individuals in a tight fetal position, with legs near the chest and hands
near the forehead or shoulder. Some graves contained individual women
over sixty years old. Another held a man over sixty years old. Other buri
als included adults and very young children (from newborn to seven years
old). The children generally lay on their stomachs. Grave 5, a round pit
dug at the bottom of the ditch, specifically communicates the ritual sig
nificance of these burials. Animal bones (fish, sheep, pig, cattle, and
aurochs) filled its upper layers. Under the animal bones, excavators found
an adult female skeleton without the skull, and below the woman, the
skeletons of two children, ages five and seven. Each grave in this roundel
differed from burials found in ordinary cemeteries. Thousands of potsherds
and animal bones filled the ditches, indicating further ritual activities. The
long bones of the animals had been split for bone marrow extraction. From
this evidence, we can picture large gatherings of people feasting there at
special rites, perhaps honoring death or seasonal regeneration. The pres
ence of aurochs’ horns also links these monuments with rituals of death
and regeneration. (The aurochs was the wild ancestor of our domesticated
cattle.) Excavators found enormous aurochs’ horns near the two gates of
the Bruchsal-“Aue”roundel, in the outer ditch. Originally, these horns may
have been attached to wooden poles or gates. Several other horns as well
were found in the ditch, near the graves (Behrends 1991).
Neolithic builders also scattered several woodhenges throughout cen
tral Europe. In plan, woodhenges resemble an enlarged roundel without
the ditch and palisade structure. Instead, woodhenges have rings of wooden
posts. At Schalkenburg near Quenstedt in central Germany, archaeologists
detected an impressive structure with five concentric wood-post circles
and gates in the four directions (Behrens 1981). The diameter of the outer
ring measured about 100 meters. Excavators found nothing in the post
holes. Two early Funnel-necked Beaker culture (Baalberge-type) graves,
found within the inner area, may date Schalkenburg to the early fourth mil
lennium b.c. A Funnel-necked Beaker culture (Bemburg-type) occupation
dating later than the monument also helped establish its chronology.
BRITISH ROUNDELS
From 1908 to 1922 archaeologists excavated Avebury, one of the largest
and best-known British roundels (located west of Marlborough in W ilt
shire). A large ditch varying in depth between 7 and 10 meters encircles
the village of Avebury. Outside the ditch, a bank once stood about 6.7

N
meters high. Four breaks in the bank, each about 15 meters wide, open
to the four cardinal directions. Avebury is huge, measuring some 347 meters
in diameter, with the total ditch and bank system area covering about 11.5
hectares (28.5 acres). The ditch surrounded an impressive array of ninety
eight upright stones, some as high as 5.5 meters; two smaller stone cir
cles stood within this array (Fig. 77).
Two serpentine stone avenues 2 .4 kilometers long and about 19 meters
wide travel into Avebury, joining it with other local monuments. In one
approach, known as West Kennet Avenue, two hundred standing stones,
in two lines, form a processional walkway connecting to a small round
structure known as the “Sanctuary.” The excavation of the Sanctuary (by
Maud Cunnington in 1930) revealed a circular wooden building with a
central post supporting the roof. Six rings of massive posts and small stand
ing stones surrounded the structure (the shape of which resembled the
South Circle of Durrington Walls). The Sanctuary had four building phases,
104 / Sacred Stone and Wood Ceremonial Centers



starting around 3000 b .c . when postholes formed a circle 4.5 meters across,
and ending some four hundred years later when a stone circle 40.2 meters
in diameter surrounded a much larger structure. The latter joined West Kennet Avenue and eventually Avebury.
Like the continental roundels, Avebury also harbored ritual burials. Sev
eral were associated with beakers dating between 2500 b .c . and 2 230 b .c .2
Excavators came upon the crouched skeleton of a young person (proba
bly a girl), fourteen to fifteen years old, associated with a stone-hole dat
ing to Avebury’s last phase, in the early second millennium b .c .3
These three interrelated monuments— the large Avebury roundel, the
Avenue (formerly two avenues), and the Sanctuary— reflect very special
ceremonial activities, including processions between monuments to
observe specific rituals. Another monument, the West Kennet long bar
row, a megalithic chambered tomb, is only one kilometer from the Avenue
and only a little farther from the Sanctuary. We know that all these mon
uments existed contemporaneously because archaeologists found the
same pottery type (Grooved ware, a grooved variety of the Rinyo-Clacton
ware) at each configuration.4
By far the most famous English roundel must be Stonehenge, located
on the Salisbury Plain. Like Avebury, it humbly began as a small ditched
ceremonial site toward the end of the fourth millennium b .c .5 Although
we now see remnants of an impressive upright stone ring arranged in sev
eral concentric circles, this arrangement evolved over several generations.
Archaeologists have designated Stonehenge’s various phases as Stonehenge
I, II, and III. Stonehenge I incorporated a small ditch outside an earthen
bank broken by an entrance. A ring of fifty-six pits, Aubrey holes (after
John Aubrey, the seventeenth-century antiquarian who first noticed them),
ran just inside the bank. Many of the holes held human cremations. A cir
cular building may have occupied the center of Stonehenge I. Stonehenge
II marks the alteration of the monument; the construction featured an
incomplete circle of eighty-two beautiful blue stones erected on an avenue
to the river Avon. Stonehenge III commenced with the demolition of the
blue stone circle. The final architects of Stonehenge then erected eighty
sarsens (sandstone boulders) in a circle about 30 meters in diameter, joined
on top by a lintel stone ring. Within this circle, they erected a U-shaped
stone configuration consisting of five upright stone pairs and a lintel. Vis
itors today see Stonehenge III.
Like Avebury, Stonehenge has links to other local ritual monuments.
Two other impressive monuments, Durrington Walls and Woodhenge, can
be viewed just three kilometers northeast of Stonehenge. G. J. Wainwright
and I. H. Longworth excavated Durrington Walls from 1966 to 1968, and
it appears to be a ceremonial enclosure even larger than Avebury. In the
105 / Sacred Stone and Wood Ceremonial Centers



interior of the enclosure, surrounded by a broad bank with two entrances,
the excavators found traces of two wooden structures. In the larger build
ing there is evidence of six concentric wooden-post circles. An avenue of
wooden posts led to the smaller round structure. Woodhenge (excavated
by Maud Cunnington in 1926 to 1928 and by J. Evans and G. J. Wain
wright in 1970) lies just south of Durrington Walls. Woodhenge consists
of a wooden structure surrounded by six concentric egg-shaped rings of
postholes, all within a henge-type earthwork. At the center of the monu
ment, the archaeologists uncovered the crouched skeleton of a three-year
old child. They also found the skeleton of a young man buried at the bottom
of the ditch. One of the postholes concealed cremated human bones.
Together, Stonehenge, Durrington Walls, and Woodhenge very likely
formed a ritual complex similar to Avebury and its environs.
In 1969, archaeologists partially excavated another gigantic enclosure
about halfway between Avebury and Durrington Walls, on the banks of
the river Avon at Marden. Their survey indicated that the Marden mon
ument, delimited by a bank with an internal ditch, enclosed some 14
hectares (35 acres). Its internal dimensions measured 530 meters from
north to south and 360 meters from east to west. Originally, the earth
work contained several openings (probably four, in the cardinal directions)
and a circular timber structure. Three radiocarbon determinations obtained
from the bottom of the ditch date the Marden monument to the early third
m ille n n i u m b .c ., making it contemporaneous with Durrington Walls.
(Grooved ware pottery corroborated the dates of both monuments.) The
archaeologists unearthed the skeleton of a young woman in the ditch.
In Dorset, England, excavations in 1970-71 uncovered yet another large
monument, this one at Mount Pleasant near Dorchester. Grooved ware
and radiocarbon analysis both suggest that Mount Pleasant dates to the
early third millennium b .c . Within the enclosure, five concentric posthole
rings suggest a large circular building. The diameter of the outer ring mea
sured about 38 meters. Four corridors divided posthole rings into arcs.
A ditch three to four meters wide and two meters deep surrounded the
circular structure. After about three hundred years, a timber palisade trench
with narrow entrances in the north and east enclosed Mount Pleasant’s
4.5-hectare (11-acre) expanse.
To summarize the British henge monuments, each consisted of one or
two circular timber structures surrounded by ditches and palisades, dat
ing from the British Late Neolithic (the late fourth to the mid-third mil
lennia b .c .). The earliest pottery is Grooved ware, and Beaker ware denotes
the end phases of the henges. Feasting and consumption on a large scale
are suggested by finds from ditches and postholes: broken pots, cups, and
bowls; flint artifacts (mostly scrapers); chalk balls; antler picks; and quan
106 / Sacred Stone and Wood Ceremonial Centers



tides of wild and domestic animal bones, particularly those of pigs and
cattle. Joints of meat, especially the hind legs of young pigs, were scattered
in deposits. Archaeologists have found middens, or garbage piles, as well
as extensively burned areas, on platforms outside the entrances to the sanc
tuaries (for instance, at Durrington Walls’ South Circle sanctuary); these
suggest ritual feasts and offerings. Human burials, whether by cremation
(as at Stonehenge), in ditches or postholes (as at Marden and Avebury), or
in the center of a sanctuary (as at Woodhenge), may have assumed dedi
catory or other ritual purposes. The British roundels appear related in func
tion to each other and to those found in central Europe, as evidenced by
their similar designs, their ceremonial artifacts, and the sacrificial or ritual
nature of their human remains. It is very possible that roundels were sacred
places, dedicated to the goddess. Aligned with the cosmos, the territory of
the roundel may have replicated a symbolic universe. Thus, a cosmic ide
ology may have motivated these Old European cultures to build such large
scale monuments. Through ritual in these monuments, they would have
honored the Old European goddess of death and regeneration.
Causewayed Enclosures
Besides roundels, Old European cultures erected irregularly shaped
ditched monuments that enclosed a specific area. Ditches and timber pali
sades also characterize these enclosures, but their noncircular design clas
sifies them differently from roundels. However, like the builders of
roundels, the originators of the irregularly shaped enclosures expended
enormous effort to ritually transform their terrain. The fact that roundels
have been found within irregularly shaped enclosures suggests that the
monument types may have been related.
The shape and dimensions of the enclosure depended much on local
topography. Frequently, the local Old Europeans built enclosures on
promontories, on river terraces, and at the bottoms of valleys, surrounded
by lakes, bogs, and streams. Sometimes they located enclosures on hills.
An enclosure could be oval, subcircular, triangular, or roughly rectangu
lar. Like other Neolithic monuments, enclosures vary enormously in dimen
sion. The enclosed area ranged from a few hectares to sixteen hectares (a
few acres to forty acres) and was surrounded by one, two, or more ditches
with interruptions. Ditches could be two to eight meters wide, and one
half to three meters deep. Sometimes a palisade, made of upright posts
(usually oak) interwoven with wickerwork, lined the inner side of a ditch.
The builders of an enclosure felled thousands of trees for a single palisade.
As with roundels, irregularly shaped enclosures were considered a
British phenomenon. In fact, the Windmill Hill enclosure gave its name
107 / Sacred Stone and Wood Ceremonial Centers



to the Neolithic era in south-central England. Windmill Hill’s outer ditch,
interrupted by causeways, enclosed an area of about eight hectares (twenty
acres). For decades, publications misleadingly called such nonsettlement
sites “causewayed camps” (after Roman marching camps), which obscured
their real meaning. Rather, irregularly shaped enclosures such as cause
wayed enclosures show evidence for ritual use comparable to that of
roundels. Excavators do not find traces of settlements in irregularly
shaped enclosures, and artifacts recovered from the ditches include pot
tery, human and animal bones, substantial food remains, white chalk balls,
and flint and bone tool deposits. Hence, causewayed enclosures cannot
be confused with hill forts or settlement enclosures. Causewayed enclo
sures uniquely characterize Old Europe, and they have no historical par
allels. By now archaeologists have recorded and/or systematically researched
hundreds of enclosures not only in England and Ireland, but across con
tinental Europe. Their interpretation will reveal a great deal about the social
and spiritual lives of their builders.
A detailed look at artifacts from the ditches of the irregularly shaped
enclosures shows that these artifacts recur wherever enclosures are found,
and that they are related to materials found in roundels. Irregularly shaped
enclosures conceal votive offerings that include complete pots, and stone
or bone tools, especially axes. Mysterious deposits of organic material now
appear as dark humus-colored layers at the bottom of a ditch. Charcoal,
cups and bowls, and masses of animal bones (cattle, pigs, and sheep) speak
of large-scale feasting. Rituals might have included animal sacrifices. At
the Bjergg&rd enclosure in Denmark, excavators unearthed four dog
skulls that had been placed on a stone paving.
Several human skeletons suggest ritual burial or sacrifice. Human skulls
and isolated jawbones are common (as in Sarup, Denmark: Madsen 1988;
Andersen 1988). The site of Champ-Durand revealed a number of unusual
burials: in addition to children’s skulls, excavators came upon five com
plete juvenile and adult skeletons. A niche dug into the wall of the ditch
harbored the remains of a young man and a young woman. Other skele
tons included a thirteen- to fifteen-year-old boy, an eighteen-year-old youth,
and an adult woman found in the debris of a fallen wall with a mass of
pottery. The cause of death of these individuals remains a mystery, so we
do not know if these were human sacrifices or ceremonial burials of hon
ored individuals who died natural deaths.
Skulls, jaws, and skeletal parts found in enclosures may have been rem
nants of excamation rites. As discussed earlier, certain Old European cul
tures exposed their dead to nature and scavengers before actual burial in
order to remove the flesh. Enclosures may have been the places where
such excarnation rites took place. After the relatives and survivors feasted

and performed rituals, they collected the skeletons and deposited them
in the ossuaries in the megalithic tombs. Some disarticulated bones might
have been left in the ditch. Some skeletons, particularly those of the young,
might have been left behind for ritual purposes. If this scenario holds true,
then the enclosures would be part of a complex funerary ritual. Several
artifacts support linking the enclosures with death and regeneration: the
pottery and its decoration, white chalk balls (probably replicas of eggs),
and types of animals sacrificed. All these symbols belong to the goddess
of death and regeneration. Some vases deposited in ditches or special votive
pits portray symbols associated with the goddess of death and regenera
tion, such as round owl eyes, triangles, or hourglass shapes. The same
symbols appear on funerary monuments such as the passage graves. Exca
vators discovered clay drums decorated with breasts and hourglass shapes
(schematic contours impersonating the goddess) at the Dolauer Heide
enclosure in central Germany (Fig. 78).
In Denmark, research reveals that one enclosure occupied the center
of a megalithic tomb cluster dating from 35 0 0 to 3200 b.c., which sug
gests the relation between enclosures and tombs. A similar situation has
been reconstructed in the Orkney Islands. In Wessex, England, an enclo
sure and long barrow group appear related. In Neolithic society, death rit
uals were an enormous force that governed social interaction.
Other artifacts and skeletons recovered from the enclosures confirm
109 / Sacred Stone and Wood Ceremonial Centers



their religious nature, and particularly their connection with death and
regeneration. One enclosure revealed anthropomorphic figurines and clay
thrones for figurines. Sacrificed dogs confirm that rituals relating to death
and regeneration took place, since the dog belongs to the goddess of death
and regeneration. Many funerary monuments in widely separated loca
tions across Europe, such as Lepenski Vir (circa 6 5 0 0 -5 5 0 0 b.c.) and the
Orkney Islands (third millennium b.c.), disclosed whole skeletons of sac
rificed dogs. The motif of a dog or hound accompanying the goddess echoes
throughout history. The dog accompanied Hekate in Greece, and through
out Europe the hound serves the white lady— the goddess of death— still
said to appear in some villages.
Square Enclosures
In addition to the roundels and irregularly shaped ditched enclosures,
archaeologists have discovered square enclosures in central Europe. Like
the roundels and irregularly shaped enclosures, square enclosures do not
contain settlements and they lack defensive character. One example is
Makotrasy in Bohemia. The principles employed in constructing square
enclosures provide more distinct evidence for abstract conceptual plan
ning. These sites, attributed to the Funnel-necked Beaker culture (Baal
berge group), in existence during the first half of the fourth millennium
b.c., yielded several ditch systems, including one near-perfect square mea
suring three hundred by three hundred meters. The geometric regularity
of the square enclosures suggests an astronomical orientation parallel to
the alignment of the roundels.
Towns Conceived as Replicating the Universe
The concept of a “miniature universe,” first applied to ceremonial sites,
seems to have been applied to some settled towns as well. In several set
tlements of the Karanovo people of northeastern Bulgaria, for example
Poljanica and Ovcarovo, town plans reflected squares with strict geometric
regularity and gates in the four cardinal directions. Several palisade rows,
like those found in roundels, surrounded Karanovo towns. Like the
entrances to the roundels, the main streets aligned north-south and east
west, with houses grouped in four quadrangles. Such towns are, of
course, labeled “fortified settlements.” It seems that here, however, as in
roundels, the palisades served a symbolic purpose rather than a defen
sive one.
110 / Sacred Stone and Wood Ceremonial Centers



Conclusions
The roundels and enclosures discussed here were strictly nonsettlement
sites, void of habitation debris. They were therefore ceremonial in nature.
Aligned to the cardinal directions, these structures may have represented
the cosmos. This concept was first applied to sacred ceremonial places.
Subsequently, the concept was transferred to towns, such as the Karanovo
settlements described above.
Much of the architecture of Old Europe was religious. The motivation
behind these amazing structures appears to be the satisfaction of an obli
gation to the ancestors, alignment with the cosmos, and honoring of the
goddess of birth, death, and regeneration. Rather than being defensive, these
structures were monuments reflecting the spiritual life of Old Europe.

C H A P T E R SIX
Matrilineal Social Structure as Mirrored in Religion and Myth
The Parthenogenetic Goddess-Creatress
During the Paleolithic and Neolithic eras of prehistory, the worship of a
female deity as the creatress of life mirrors the matrilineal, or mother
kinship, system that most likely existed in these times. The religious sym
bolism is permeated by symbols based on the life-creating female body.
The mother and the mother-daughter images are present throughout Old
Europe, while the father image, so prevalent in later times, is missing. The
goddess is nature and earth itself, pulsating with the seasons, bringing life
in spring and death in winter. She also represents continuity of life as a
perpetual regenerator, protectress, and nourisher.
The role of the father in prehistoric antiquity was either not fully under
stood or not as highly valued as that of the mother. The female body gives
evidence of maternity, while the male body does not give evidence of pater
nity. Further, in many societies females did not mate for life with their
male sexual partners. This would lead to an inability to establish pater
nity, the identity of the exact biological father of a woman’s child. Estab
lishing paternity is one of the cornerstones of later patriarchal cultures,
which insisted on controlling womens reproductive behavior. This inabil
ity to establish paternity has an effect on social structure because, when
the biological father cannot be determined, the mother and her kin auto
matically are the focus of the family, and the family structure is matrilineal.
The woman’s body was regarded as parthenogenetic, that is, creating
life out of itself. This ability was celebrated in religion. In Neolithic times
and earlier in the Upper Paleolithic, religion centered on the feminine
power, as shown by the abundance of female symbolism. Just as the female
body was regarded as the goddess creatress, so too the world was regarded
as the body of the goddess, constantly creating new life from itself. The
112



imagery of Neolithic art is overwhelmingly feminine: the female body, and
particularly its generative parts— vulva and uterus or womb— are pre
dominant. These symbols appear not only on figurines or larger sculp
tures of goddesses, but also on vases, cult equipment, and in tomb and
temple architecture.
Mother as Progenitor o f the Family and Woman’s Role in Religion
Given Neolithic religious symbolism, it is extremely difficult to imagine
that Old European society would not be matrilineal, with the mother or
grandmother venerated as progenitor of the family. In fact, the spiritual
and social worlds were intimately intertwined: part of Old European reli
gion was ancestor worship, in which the oldest women in the family, pro
genitors of a particular branch of the family, were venerated. This is shown
strikingly by the burials of older women beneath houses and temples and
under long barrows, by the spatial arrangements of graves in some ceme
teries, and by the particularly rich symbolic artifacts buried with women.
Obviously, the burial underneath the house had a specific purpose.
Archaeologists consider these types of burials to be a form of ancestor wor
ship, in which the presence of an especially revered ancestor beneath the
dwelling ensures the blessing of that ancestor or the continued presence
of the spirit. In this way, the continuity of the family and its dwelling was
ensured.
An analysis of the skeletons found underneath Old European houses
or near them reveals two important facts essential to understanding Old
European social structure and religion: first, these burials were almost
always women, and second, the women were usually of an older age. This
is the type of evidence we would expect to find in a matrilineal culture in
which the women were heads of families and extended clans. An older
woman was the ancestor whose blessing was sought to ensure continuity
of the family she had started, and who was honored by burial beneath
one of her houses or temples. At Gatal Huyuk, in south-central Turkey,
the skeleton of an older woman was found beneath the floor of one of the
largest shrine rooms, under the wall with a painting measuring eighteen
meters across depicting Catal Huyuk itself. She had been buried with a
great deal of care, covered in jewelry. This particular burial was undoubt
edly a revered ancestor. After 50 0 0 b.c., the tradition of burying impor
tant individuals underneath or near houses continued, but in addition the
Old Europeans began to dispose of their dead extramurally, or outside of
their settlements, in cemeteries. At first, groups of five to ten people were
buried near each other. Unlike the intramural burial, or burial within a
113 / Matrilineal Social Structure



settlement, where a single important individual was buried for religious
reasons, the extramural cemeteries contain more of a cross section of
Neolithic society. Perhaps the most notable feature of Old European graves
and cemeteries is a lack of emphasis on material goods. In the Linear
bandkeramik (LBK) cemeteries of central and eastern Europe, for instance,
only 20 to 30 percent of graves possess grave goods: tools, pottery, jew
elry, and other symbolic items. The relative poverty of the cemeteries con
trasts sharply with the richness in art and wealth of Old European
settlements, and suggests again that in the treatment of the dead, the con
cern was with spiritual functions rather than display of individual wealth.
While characteristics suggesting hierarchical class structure are absent,
this does not mean that some sort of division of labor between the sexes
did not occur, or that some individuals were not distinguished for rea
sons other than wealth. The 20 to 30 percent of graves that do contain
artifacts tell us some important facts about the trades and activities, and
something of the place and role of men and women in the social struc
ture as well. In the LBK culture, for instance, males were buried with stone
celts (a woodworking tool), jewelry made from imported spondylus
shells, and flint scrapers and arrowheads. These items seem to reflect the
participation of these men in trades: they were woodworkers and house
builders, hunters, and craftsmen fashioning jewelry from spondylus
seashells. In inland areas, seashells were obviously an item that had to be
traded over long distances, and the presence of seashells in graves sug
gests that trading, too, was the province of men. In the Lengyel culture,
men were buried with tools and other artifacts suggesting trades and min
ing: stone axes and hammer-axes made from antler and with nodules of
flint and obsidian. The latter were mined in the nearby Carpathian Moun
tains. Artifacts found with women also show particular occupations. Some
women’s graves contained quern stones, suggesting grinding grain and
baking. Tool kits for decorating pottery were found in several graves. But
the types of artifacts found in male graves versus female graves are not
subject to a strict division of labor. In some cemeteries, the same types of
artifacts— quern stones, axes, chisels, or copper and shell jewelry
appear in both male and female graves.
Significantly, women’s graves demonstrate the important role of women
in religion. After 5000 b.c., when cemeteries appeared, older women in
cemeteries continued to be accorded high status. Their connection to home
and temple life is attested by the high concentration of symbolic items in
their graves. Among cemeteries of the LBK group, women’s graves often
contained decorated pottery, ocher, and palettes, all notably religious arti
facts. Particularly rich grave goods were found in women’s and young girl’s
graves in the late LBK (Stroked Pottery phase) and Lengyel culture. In this
114 / M ainlined Social Structure



area, several graves of women were distinguished from those of men by
the presence of many vases and, especially, jewelry: copper, shell, and bone
beads, and beautiful geometrically decorated bone bracelets. Two graves
from Krusza Zamkowa, western Poland, belong to an older and a younger
woman. The exceptional richness of these two graves suggests the impor
tant position of the women in the society; perhaps they were a revered
spiritual leader and her daughter. One remarkable grave showing the
importance of females in Old European religion and society was excavated
in the cemetery at Aszod, north of Budapest, Hungary. Here, a teenage
girl was buried with a large clay temple model (N. Kalicz 1985; illustrated
also in Gimbutas 1991, Fig. 3-39). The temple model shows that this
teenage girl was closely connected with the temple and its family group
and was an important member of the lineage of women within the family.
Kinship Evidence from Cemeteries and Settlements
In the early cemeteries, dating to the millennium between 50 0 0 and 40 0 0
b .c ., graves were grouped together in clusters. In the earliest cemeteries,
graves were clustered together in groups of five to ten, a pattern that sug
gests a family unit. At the Aszod cemetery, graves were clustered together
in three groups of about thirty each, which may reflect kin-related groups.
Studies of megalithic tombs in northern Europe also reveal groupings of
twenty to thirty individuals. The study of skeletal material has shown that
individuals of each group were interrelated genetically (according to the
study of bones from megalithic tombs of the Waltemienburg group in cen
tral Germany, conducted by H. Ullrich). Megalithic tombs of northwest
ern Europe often include two or three chambers instead of one. These
may represent subgroups within a larger kin-group. Keith Branigan stud
ied Cretan circular tombs, tholoi, which dated to the third millennium b .c .;
he found that they are burial places of extended families with a living mem
bership of about twenty persons. At many sites, two or three tombs are
built alongside one another at about the same time. One tomb of the group
is architecturally superior to the others, which suggests that one family
claimed primacy or preeminence and that communities already knew a
degree of social ranking. Groupings in twos and threes with a noticeable
preeminence of one house are also recognizable in settlements, where often
two houses (one larger and one smaller) or groups of three houses (one
larger and two smaller) stand together.
Research in Denmark, Wessex, and the Orkney Islands has shown that
a single ditched enclosure appears in relation to a cluster of tombs within
a particular area. Such territorial groupings, consisting of a large, ditched
enclosure and some ten to twenty megalithic tombs, were mapped in cen
115 / Matrilineal Social Structure



tral Jutland, Denmark.1If we assume that one tomb belonged to a village,
then a group of villages (up to twenty) very likely were responsible for
building the enclosure, which served as a communal and religious center.
In the Orkney Islands north of Scotland, the remains of large and small
monuments offer insight into the relationship of villages to monuments.
Here, a number of large chambered cairns still stand, as well as smaller
cairns (see Fraser 1983; Biaggi 1994, 59 ff). The spatial distribution tells
us something about who used the monuments: no two of the large mon
uments are found near each other.2 Rather, each of the large cairns seems
to be part of a topographic unit and probably served the villages in this
area. The more numerous smaller cairns were located near individual vil
lages, and it seems that each village had a cairn. The larger cairns more
likely served as meeting and ritual sites on important occasions through
out the year, and were constructed and maintained by people from sev
eral villages.
In studies of spatial distributions of settlements and monuments in the
Orkneys, Denmark, Wessex, and elsewhere, there is no evidence of a patri
archal chiefdom society at work. In the past, it has been assumed that the
labor to construct these monuments must have been directed by a ruling
class, and that the monuments themselves served some secular purpose:
as royal courts or tombs. But as we saw with ditched ceremonial centers,
in chapter 5, these monuments are religious in nature and were built by
collective effort. No individual monument stands out as the seat of a
chieftain.
The study of spatial distribution of graves in Old European cemeter
ies and tombs suggests the existence of family lineages. The same is pro
vided by the study of blood groups. Remarkably, it is possible to
determine blood type from the bones of people dead for thousands of
years. Certain cemeteries of the Lengyel culture in Hungary have been
studied by Istvan Zalai-Gaal and Imre Lengyel, who analyzed the blood
types of the skeletons— men, women, and children. The adult females
and children were found to have been related by blood group, but the
adult males in the same cemetery were found to be unrelated. This is the
type of pattern we would expect in a matrilineal society, with the moth
ers and daughters maintaining residence and ownership of property, the
young men leaving to enter another family, and males from another kin
group marrying into the matrilineal family.
Another type of spatial distribution that distinguishes Old European
society from later patriarchal cultures is found in Old European settle
ments. In excavations of Neolithic sites, houses are sometimes found that
are larger and better built (with many floor renovations) than the rest.
Often, a large house is in the center of a cluster of smaller buildings. Nat
116 / Matrilineal Social Structure



urally, archaeologists have often interpreted these to be a sort of “big man’s”
house, and the small houses as being the quarters for vassals and servants.
This view is clearly inaccurate: evidence for a hierarchical type of patri
archal society is totally lacking in settlement evidence just as in cemetery
evidence or in any other facet of Old European life. A large house was the
central house of a “core family” of a lineage.
At a number of Old European sites, temples are found within a clus
ter of several buildings. At the early Neolithic site of Nea Nikomedeia in
northern Greece, the largest building, distinguished not only by its size
but by the number of ritual objects found within it, was surrounded by
six smaller houses. In the Tisza and Vinca cultures, similar arrangements
of houses and temples are found. Most likely, the houses held members
of a kin-related group descended from one female ancestor. The shrine
would be kept by the female members of the families living in the sur
rounding houses. The temple was in essence a family shrine maintained
by members of the extended family. The tradition of several related fam
ilies tending a common shrine is still found among the Christian Ortho
dox on islands of the Aegean. Significantly, this activity is carried out by the women of the families.
We see from the above discussions that the obvious signs of patriar
chal societies were absent from the Old European cemeteries and settle
ments. Nowhere do we find the evidence we would expect to find in
patriarchal societies: individual burials of male nobility buried in a man
ner that would reflect their worldly status.3
The Male Role in Symbolism and Myth
The male element in symbolism was significant but far from being promi
nent. In the Old European symbolic system, male animals and humans
stimulate and enhance life, particularly plant growth. They are an impor
tant part in the process of becoming but do not actually create life. The
phallus (not the semen) is an important symbol. The phallus as a spon
taneous life energy is depicted alone or is shown to spring out of the female
uterus or from between horns (a metaphor for the uterus). In Maltese tem
ples, double or triple phalli appear in niche-shaped altars. In the sculp
tural representations of the early Neolithic, the phallus as divine energy
is often shown fused with the life-creating female body: for example, the
goddess sometimes has a phallic neck. Clearly, in this religious system the
two sexes complement each other and thus invigorate the powers of life.
In Neolithic art and in myth, the male deities appear as partners of the
goddesses. Alongside the mistress of animals is the master of animals, who
may be descended from the Upper Paleolithic image of the half-human/half
117 / M ainlined Social Structure



animal found in caves and associated with animals. In ęatal Hūyūk wall
paintings of the seventh millennium b.c., a male figure holds a bird in
each hand: an image parallel to that of the mistress of animals known from
the Neolithic and later times, who was portrayed grasping geese, cranes,
or other birds in each hand. In both the Neolithic and the historical era,
the earth fertility goddess sometimes was portrayed with a male partner.
The female and male deities discovered in a grave of the Hamangia cul
ture from the early fifth millennium b.c., on the coast of the Black Sea,
very likely represent a sister and brother pair rather than a married cou
ple, since in European mythologies the female and male deities are known
to be sister and brother pairs (for example, the Lithuanian earth mother,
Žemyna, has a brother, Žemininkas, and the Scandinavian great-goddess,
Freyja, has a brother, Freyr).
Another important, but different, role for the male god is that of con
sort of the great-goddess; he appears in festive rites of sacred marriage,
the hieros gamos. This ritual mating ensured the smooth process of the veg
etation cycle and secured fertility and happiness for the land. This rite is
well known from historical times, but although images of copulation date
back to the Neolithic, such images are rare (see chapter 1, on the hieros
gamos). In the early historical era, the hieros gamos was celebrated in erotic
hymns in Sumer and other Near Eastern cultures and in India. In myth
and ritual it persisted throughout history and into the twentieth century.
In myth, especially in the Irish Celtic tradition, the kingdom was con
ceived anthropomorphically as a female figure who symbolized not only
the fertility or prosperity of the land but also the spiritual and legal domin
ion.4 Irish legends from the Ulster cycle preserve strong vestiges of a pre
historic ritual in which the goddess conferred prosperity on a people by
choosing one of its male members as her mate.
The iconography of the sacred marriage is recognized in frescoes, gems,
and ivory reliefs found in Indo-European Mycenaean and later Greek art.
The repeated theme is that of the bridegroom who comes in his ship from
overseas to fulfill the sacred wedding in the sanctuary of the goddess. The
gold ring from the Mycenaean citadel of Tiryns depicts the arrival of the
bridegroom in a ship with a cabin and the encounter of the divine cou
ple at the entrance of the bride’s sanctuary. The famous Ship Fresco of the
West House of Akrotiri, Thera, according to Gosta Saflund (1981), may
represent the arrival of the bridegroom elected for the sacred wedding fes
tival to be celebrated in the sanctuary.5 The Building Complex B, in which
the Ship Fresco was found, is considered to be a sanctuary since it dis
plays loggias with large windows (as in Minoan clay models of temples),
verandas, and balconies, one of which is crowned by horns of consecra
tion. The priestess-goddess who plays the part of the divine bride appears
118 / Matrilineal Social Structure



on this balcony. She has her right arm raised: she seems to welcome the
arriving fleet and ship carrying the bridegroom. The main priestess, as
well as other women standing on the balconies and on the roof (very likely
attendants of the sanctuary), is portrayed on a larger scale than are the
men. Below the building, a procession of young men carries animals for
sacrifice. The bridegroom is identified by Saflund as a male figure in the
ship seated in an elaborate cabin, decorated with symbols of the goddess:
pendants of stylized crocus blooms, butterflies, and sunflowers; lions and
dolphins are depicted on the side of the ship. Important here is the fact
that in this fresco, as well as in other portrayals of the same and later peri
ods, the bridegroom comes to the bride’s quarters. There is no sign of the
bride leaving her home: the divine wedding of the goddess with a for
eigner (who comes from over the sea) takes place in her own temple. This
matrilocal tradition is also preserved in ancient Greece in the hieros gamos
rite of Hera performed in the sanctuary of the goddess at the Argive Heraion
and at Samos. An ivory relief from the sanctuary of Orthia, dating to the
sixth century b.c., also depicts the bridegroom arriving in his ship and
being tenderly received by the goddess.6
Priestesses and Women’s Collective Power
From the early phases of the Neolithic onward, the goddess whose part is
played by the priestess is portrayed crowned or enthroned. In early his
torical records and in folklore she is called queen, mistress, matron, or lady.
The priestess-goddess is assisted by other priestesses and helpers, num
bering from two, three, four, or nine, to a whole college. The attendants
performed a variety of duties in rituals and temple maintenance. Priest
esses and temple attendants are shown in a variety of sizes and are marked
with different symbolic designs. Next to the goddess were the priestesses
who may have formed a council important for decision-making. Councils
of nine women are mentioned in early historic records and exist in Euro
pean mythologies. The Scandinavian magician-priestess known as the
Volva had a council of nine wise women. Assemblies of nine priestesses
or muses are well known in ancient Greece. A splendid example of a group
of temple attendants is the model of an open temple from Zarkou in Thes
saly dating from the early fifth millennium b.c. (see Fig. 65, above). It
includes nine figurines of various sizes and workmanship. One priestess
(or the goddess) is shown much larger than her attendants, and she is
richly decorated with her special symbols: chevrons and tri-lines.
Another cache of twenty-one figurines was recovered from an early
Cucuteni shrine dating to the early fifth millennium b.c.; it is particularly
interesting because the figurines may represent a grouping in a temple rit
119 / M ainlined Social Structure



ual. (Excavated at Poduri-Dealul Ghindaru, Moldavia, in northeastern
Romania, these figurines are illustrated in Gimbutas 1989, Plate 9.) Most
probably used for the reenactment of earth fertility rites, the figurines mea
sure from six to twelve centimeters in height. In addition to the figurines
themselves, excavators found fifteen miniature chairs or thrones on which
the larger figurines could be seated. The three largest ones are painted
ocher-red, with opposing snake coils on the abdomen and lozenges on
the back, dotted triangles and lozenges over the ample thighs and legs,
and cartouches with chevrons over the buttocks. The medium-sized fig
urines have a striated band across the abdomen and stripes over the thighs
and legs. The small figurines were rather carelessly produced and are not
painted with symbols. Only one figurine out of the whole assembly has
human arms; her left hand touches her face, while her right hand clasps
her left arm at the elbow. The other figurines have schematized, stumpy
arms. The differences in size and quality among the figurines may reflect
differences in cult roles, ranging from goddess or priestess to various levels
of assistants and attendants.
Communities of priestesses and women’s councils, which must have
existed for millennia in Old Europe and in Crete, persisted into the patri
archal era, but only in religious rituals. In the earth fertility ritual of the
Thesmophoria (the festival of Demeter) in ancient Greece, women did
choose a presiding person and form a council in which decisions were
voted by majority rule. Men were not allowed to participate.
Communities of priestesses having great collective power are well
known in early history as sisterhoods of enchantresses (known from Gaul
ish inscriptions), and as colleges of priestesses living on islands to which
men are not admitted (mentioned by Strabo and Pomponius Mela in the
first century A .D . ) . Priestesses as oracles, prophetesses, and magicians are
known up to modem times in folklore and in myth. Groups of fairies who
dance in circles and in meadows or around stone rings, creating enor
mous energy, appear in folklore from Scotland to Bulgaria even in the twen
tieth century. The magician-goddess, who was originally the goddess of
death and regeneration but who was later considered a magician or a witch,
survives up to the present as Basque Mari, Irish Macha or Medb, Baltic
Ragana, Scandinavian Freyja, and German Holla. These goddesses appear
alone or with large groups of assistants, and they exercise supernatural
power in control of nature: the moon, the sun, eclipses, storms, hail. They
destroy or create fertility of fields and control male sexuality. They them
selves are endowed with an inexhaustible sexual energy. Irish Macha can
ran faster than the swiftest horses, while the sight of Queen Medb is suf
ficient to deprive men of two-thirds of their strength. Those who served
the Inquisition in fifteenth-century Spain destroyed huge numbers of
120 / Matrilineal Social Structure



“witches”: those who practiced the rites of the goddess and who had knowl
edge of medicinal herbs and other healing arts. Among many complaints
about the powers of witches given by a soldier to the Inquisitor there is
this notable sentence: “They have such power by reason of their arts that
they have only to command and men must obey or lose their lives” (cited
by Baroja 1975 ,1 4 9 ). Myths and beliefs describe the female as the stronger
gender, one endowed with magical powers.
Remnants o f Matrilineal Social Structure in Minoan Crete, the Northern Aegean, Etruria, and Iberia
After reaching a flowering of culture in the fifth millennium b.c., the Old
European way of life became submerged. Elements of the Indo-European
culture— its religion, economy, and social structure— came to dominate
life in Europe. The French mythologist Georges Dumézil (1939, 1958)
made the fundamental observation that deities of Indo-European religion
can generally be categorized into three classes: sovereign, warrior, and
laboring (this class also included artisans and general “fertility” figures).
Indo-Europeanized Europe fostered hierarchical societies, which were
divided into these three classes. Patriarchy, class society, and warfare became
the norm. But the Old European culture was not entirely eliminated every
where. One way in which the Old European influence was felt was in the
status of women in certain European societies in the early historical era.
The survival of Old European customs is recorded in historical accounts
that not only provide a confirmation of the matrifocal nature of Old Euro
pean society suggested by archaeological research but also provide details
of matrifocal customs which archaeology cannot preserve.
One of the regions that preserved elements of Old European culture
the longest was the Aegean, where records were found that capture descrip
tions of matrilineal customs. The Minoan culture of Crete, as a result of
its geographical location, preserved matrilineal customs much later than
its counterparts on the mainland. A vast amount of religious art, archi
tecture, and sepulchral evidence of Minoan culture attests to the impor
tance of the female and the matrilineal inheritance patterns of the culture.
Even after the arrival of the Indo-European Mycenaeans, the matrilineal
traditions remained strong. In the first century b.c., the Greek historian
and geographer Strabo describes matrilocal marriage in Crete, and the exis
tence of this custom is confirmed by evidence from the marriage laws pre
served in the Law Code of Gortyna (fifth century b.c.). The laws state that
the woman retained control of her property even after marriage, and that
she could choose to divorce at her will. Another aspect of the Old Euro
pean matrilineal system, the avunculate— the important role carried out
121 / Matrilineal Social Structure



by the womans brother— is described in the same inscriptions. Among
other responsibilities, the brother was responsible for the upbringing of
his sister’s children.7 Another area that preserved elements of the matrifocal system is
Sparta. Although Sparta embodied many elements of Indo-European social
structure, such as an emphasis on war, the isolated location of the city
state in the center of the Peloponnese Peninsula of Greece helped it to
preserve Old European elements.8 The Etruscans of central Italy also preserved matrifocal customs; this
culture flourished from the eighth century b.c. onward, but it fell into
decline after the fifth century b .c ., when it began a gradual assimilation
into the Roman Empire. The Greek historian Theopompus, who wrote
during the fourth century b .c ., was shocked by the freedom and power
of Etruscan women. Theopompus recorded that Etruscan women would
often exercise unabashedly in the nude with men and with other women.
They liked to drink, and they dressed in a manner similar to that of men.
They even wore symbols of citizenship and rank: mantles and high shoes.
The names of Etruscan women reflected their legal and social status, in
sharp contrast to Roman customs, where a woman had no name of her
own. In fact, before a Roman woman was married, she was known as her
father’s daughter, and after marriage she was known as her husband’s wife.
In contrast to Roman women, Etruscan women played important roles as
priestesses and seers, and they were a force in politics.
Many other aspects of Etruscan society reflect matrilineal succession
and a matrifocal household. Theopompus recorded that Etruscan women
raised their own children, whether they knew the father or not. This matri
focality was probably related to the woman’s right to own property and
to matrilineal succession. Matrilineal succession was reflected in the nam
ing of individuals: in Etruscan inscriptions, individuals are referred to by
the mother’s name only. (For more on the role of Etruscan women, see
chapter 9.)
The survival of matrilineal practices is not simply a peculiarity of the
ancient Greek, Aegean, and Mediterranean worlds but is also found in the
peripheral areas of northern and western Europe, where the influence of
the infiltrating Indo-European tribes was weaker. Among the ancient and
modem cultures that preserve this aspect of Old European heritage are
the Basque culture of Spain and France, the Iberians, and the Piets of Scot
land. Other cultures that were predominantly Indo-European, but which
also preserved matrilineal traits, were the Celts, the Teutons, and the Balts.
One of the most remarkable cultures that preserves Old European roots
is the Basque, which survives to the present day in northern Spain and
southeastern France. The Basques have a completely non-Indo-European
122 / Matrilineal Social Structure



culture, with its own non-Indo-European language, folklore, legal code,
and matrilineal customs descended from Old European times. Basque law
codes give the woman high status as inheritor, arbitrator, and judge, in
both ancient and modem times. The laws governing succession in the
French Basque region treat men and women entirely equally. Another Old
European culture on the Iberian Peninsula was the Iberian, whose matri
focal practices were discussed by the Greek historian and geographer Strabo
in the first century b .c .: “Among the Iberians, the men bring dowries to
the women. With them the daughters alone inherit property. Brothers are
given away in marriage by their sisters. In all their usages, their social con
dition is one of gynaecocracy.”9
Farther north in Europe, ancient written records preserve memories
of Old European cultures in the British Isles. The area of present-day Scot
land was inhabited by a tribe known as the Piets, who spoke a non-Indo
European language and who escaped Indo-Europeanization until quite
late because the Roman Empire never extended farther north than
Hadrian’s Wall. The Piets also preserved matrilineal laws and the goddess
religion and its symbols. In this culture, transmission of property was matri
lineal. Another Pictish custom, one still practiced in parts of the Scottish
Highlands into the early twentieth century, was that of the woman remain
ing in her parents’ house, even after marriage.
Much of Britain and Ireland was occupied in pre-Roman times by Celtic
tribes who, although speaking Indo-European languages, still retained
many Old European customs, such as goddess worship and matrilineal
succession. Traditional Irish narratives describe marriage as being essen
tially matrilocal. Early Irish and Welsh literature preserves legends of Celtic
heroes who, like the Greek heroes, leave home to seek an heiress to marry
and thus share rule over her lands. The laws of ancient Ireland and Wales
reflect an important role for the maternal brother, who represented the
maternal kin, as well as an important role for the sister’s son, who inher
ited the estate. Most probably, matrilineal succession was the rule in ancient
Celtic society.10
Generally speaking, ancient records and archaeology both reveal the
important social role of Celtic women, who had personal prestige and could
possess property, even though the Celtic legal system was founded in patri
archal Indo-European custom. The region of Gaul (modem-day France)
was inhabited in Roman times by Celtic tribes. In the first century b .c .,
the Greek author Diodorus Siculus describes Gaulish women as being “not
only equal to their husbands in stature, but they rival them in strength as
well.”11 One of the best-known Celtic historical figures was Boudicca, a
Celtic queen who lived on the island of Britain. She was actually the widow
of a Celtic king, and she instigated a rebellion against the Romans in order
123 / Matrilineal Social Structure



to reclaim her inheritance. The Roman Dio Cassius describes her in awe:
“She was huge of frame, terrifying of aspect. . . . A great mass of bright
red hair fell to her knees: she wore a great twisted golden tore [around
her neck], and a tunic of many colors, over which was a thick mantle, fas
tened by a brooch.”12 Archaeological excavations in eastern France and
the Rhineland have revealed remarkably rich graves of Iron Age Celtic
women, dating from the seventh to the fourth centuries b.c.; these women
belonged to the Celtic Hallstatt and La Tène cultures.
In ancient times, matrifocal traits also persisted in the Scandinavian
and the Germanic areas, where the maternal relationship was considered
more important than the paternal. Among the Thuringians, a man’s prop
erty passed to his sister or mother if he died without children. In Bur
gundy, the estates and titles of royal houses passed through the women.
Among the Saxons, a claim to the throne was not considered complete
until the aspirant had married the queen.13 In various Germanic tribes,
matrilineal succession was the norm, and the kingdom was inherited
through marriage with the queen or princess. As late as the eighth cen
tury a.d. in Scandinavia, a kingdom passed to the daughters and their hus
bands. The earliest historical documents of the Nordic and Germanic tribes
tell that men were often named according to their mother’s name, rather
than their father’s: the same practice we saw among non-Indo-European
cultures of the Aegean area.
In the ancient cultures of the early historical period, many elements of
Old European culture remained. One of the most visible is matriliny and
the inheritance of property through the female line of the family; the suc
cession to the throne or position of power also passed through the female
line, from mother to daughter. We see the importance of the female lin
eage in the naming of individuals, who are named after the mother rather
than the father. Of particular importance was the sister-brother relation
ship; even marriages between brother and sister are known, for example
in ancient Egypt. The sister had a greater loyalty to her brother than to
her husband. The brother was directly involved in the rearing and edu
cation of the children. In many places, marriage was endogamous: that
is, people married within their culture groups.
In the Indo-European cultures we are most familiar with, the patriar
chal society, with its emphasis on warfare and the value of weapons, is
mirrored in religion by warrior-deities and in religious symbolism by the
emphasis on weaponry. The hierarchical stratification of Indo-European
societies is reflected in the hierarchy of Indo-European deities. In Old
Europe, the social structure of society was different. This is one of the pri
mary reasons that Old European religion had a nature fundamentally dif
ferent from the more familiar Indo-European religions.
124 / Matrilineal Social Structure



Conclusions
The reconstruction of the pre-Indo-European social structure of Old Europe
is possible if various sources from different disciplines are used: linguis
tic, historical, mythological, religious, archaeological (especially the evi
dence from cemeteries and settlements). Evidence from these disciplines
shows that the Old European social structure was matrilineal, with the
succession to the throne and inheritance passing through the female line.
The society was organized around a theacratic, democratic temple com
munity guided by a highly respected priestess and her brother (or uncle);
a council of women served as a governing body. In all of Old Europe, there
is no evidence for the Indo-European type of patriarchal chieftainate.

PART II
The Living Goddesses
Old European Religious Continuity through the Bronze Age,
Early Historical Period, and into M odem Times



The contact between Old European and Indo-European cultures, quite
opposed in social structure and ideology, resulted in the European cultures
that we recognize from historical times through today. Indo-European lan
guage, beliefs, and social structure predominated, but they did not erad
icate indigenous Old European religion and customs everywhere. The
contact between the two cultures resulted in their amalgamation. Old Euro
pean religion and customs remained a strong undercurrent that influenced
the development of Western civilization. In some areas, like Minoan Crete
and the Aegean Islands, a completely theacentric, gynocentric1 civiliza
tion and religion endured through the first half of the second millennium
b.c. Elsewhere, cultures still worshiped Old European divinities, although
they adopted a hierarchical social structure. The Mycenaeans of Greece,
Etruscans of central Italy, and Celts of central Europe, Britain, and Ireland
exemplify this case, as do the Baltic, Slavic, and Germanic cultures to a
certain degree.
Old European religion and customs survived because the Old Euro
peans themselves endured. In geographical areas where the Indo-Europeans
assimilated with the Old Europeans, the pastoral Indo-Europeans became
the ruling warrior caste; the Old Europeans remained agriculturalists and
craftspeople, retaining their beliefs and customs. In time the two groups
adopted each other’s deities and practices, fusing the characteristics of
deities from separate cultures into one.
Powerful goddesses inherited from the Neolithic occur throughout
Europe, but their preservation differs from region to region. Most tenacious
are the birth and life bringer and the goddess of death and regeneration.
The continuity of her major prehistoric characteristics demonstrates their
universality. Historical records, literary works, and survivals in folklore flesh
out the archaeological evidence, allowing a more complete reconstruction
129



of these prehistoric images. Hence the heirs of Old European goddesses
and gods, assimilated into the early historical patriarchal cultures, help us
to understand the Old European deities and their eventual destinies.
1 will not describe here every deity of Old European descent from the
Bronze Age to modem times. A selection from various regions and peri
ods will suffice. For our purposes I have chosen the following cultures to
discuss:
FROM SOUTHERN EUROPE:
The Minoan on Crete, to illustrate the undisturbed continuity through
out the Bronze Age
The Greek (beginning with the Mycenaean Bronze Age), to show
the persistence of Old European religious structure under Indo
European rule, as well as the hybridization or change of certain
deities
The Etruscan in Italy, which demonstrates the continuity of indigenous
elements merged with the Indo-European influence via contact with
the Greeks2
The Basque in northern Spain and southern France, which exemplifies
the persistence of the indigenous religion of western Europe
FROM CENTRAL AND NORTHERN EURO PE:
The Celtic of central Europe, Britain, and Ireland: a culture with very
strong Old European undercurrents
The Germanic, mainly Scandinavian, Christianized after a .d . 1000,
where sagas describe two categories of deities: the Vanir (indigenous
goddesses and gods) and the Aesir (Indo-European deities), their
wars, and reconciliation
The Baltic, pagan almost to the sixteenth century a .d ., which preserves
Neolithic mythical figures up to modem times despite the presence
of an Indo-European superstratum

CHAPTER SEVEN
The Minoan Religion in Crete
T
he upheavals that followed the Indo-European infiltrations into
Europe from 4 3 0 0 to 290 0 b . c . transformed different regions at dif
ferent times and to differing degrees; a few areas were left relatively unaf
fected. One such region is the Aegean area to the south and east of mainland
Greece. The Aegean civilization consisted of many small islands in the
Aegean Sea, including the Cycladic archipelago and the small island of
Thera. It also included the large island of Crete south of the Aegean in the
Mediterranean Sea. Here Old European and Anatolian1religion and social
structure remained strong, as evidenced in art, pottery, architecture, and
burial customs.
In the Old European Neolithic, the mainland and island peoples spoke
a common language or several closely related languages that were non
Indo-European. Linguists recognize at least six thousand ancient Euro
pean words that can be identified as non-Indo-European. Geographical
place-names are found in non-Indo-European words such as “Zakynthos,”
the ancient name of Zante, an island in the Ionian Sea to the west of Greece;
and “Hyakinthos,” a pre-Greek god; or names with “ss,” as in “Knossos,”
one of the most important ancient cities of Crete.2
Crete and the other Aegean Islands were among the areas that remained
unaffected by the infiltrations of Indo-European-speaking tribes during
the third millennium; these islands may owe their cultural survival to the
fact that Indo-European peoples depended heavily on the horse and were,
at least in their early stages, not well acquainted with navigation. The dis
tance to Crete and the Aegean Islands, combined with the difficulty of
transporting horses and soldiers by sea, contributed to the continuity and
preservation of indigenous culture on Crete and the other Aegean islands.
While Old European cultural development on the mainland was diverted
by Indo-European influences, the Aegean Islands, particularly Crete, encap
131



sulated the evolution toward Old European high civilization. It is impor
tant to remember that the Minoans flourished for some two thousand years
after most Old European cultures in east-central Europe had disintegrated
through contact with Indo-European cultures.
Cretan civilization remains the best-known Aegean culture. It was exca
vated fairly early in the history of archaeology, along with the famous Egyp
tian and Mesopotamian excavations. Sir Arthur Evans implemented the
first excavations of Crete in 1900, and over the next twenty-five years he
uncovered the large site of Knossos, on the north shore of the island near
the modem city of Herakleion. He named the advanced Cretan culture
“Minoan,” after the legendary King Minos of Knossos, known from later
Greek mythology.
Since it first came to light, Minoan culture has fascinated twentieth
century poets, writers, and historians, who saw its art as spontaneous,
sensuous, and life affirming, in contrast to the structured forms of classi
cal Greece and Rome. Although scholars of the early and middle twenti
eth centuries explained the origin of Minoan culture and religion by
diffusion from the Near East (which occurred to a certain extent), its life
affirming, goddess-inspired art and religion stem from its Old European
Anatolian heritage. Because the Minoans lived some two millennia after
the height of Old European civilization, they possessed more advanced
artistic and architectural technologies than the Neolithic east-central
Europeans. Therefore, their civilization and religious expression appear
more distinct.
The same peoples inhabited Crete from the early Neolithic through the
Bronze Age; Crete possessed small agricultural communities as early as
the seventh millennium b.c. Between 6000 and 300 0 b.c., these commu
nities produced pottery and figurines similar to those found on mainland
sites. Traditionally, Minoan culture is considered a “civilization” only since
around 2000 b.c., when it satisfied two of the criteria traditionally required
for such status; the building of true cities or religious centers (at Knos
sos, Mallia, Phaistos, and later at Zakros) and the construction of monu
mental structures. Early in this century, when excavators such as Sir Arthur
Evans first exposed Minoan sites, at each site they found notable central
buildings with large central courts. Drawing on knowledge of Near East
ern cities and sites on mainland Greece, where large central buildings usu
ally housed royalty or warrior chiefs, the excavators termed the large
Minoan buildings palaces, even though large portions of these structures
clearly accommodated religious rituals. Evans even remarked that the build
ings seemed to resemble temples more than palaces. Unfortunately, the
term palace, with its connotation of a hierarchical society, has stuck. The
132 / The Minoan Religion



evolutionary phases of Minoan culture are still classified with reference
to the “palaces.”After the “early palatial”period (1 9 0 0 -1 7 0 0 b.c.), Minoan
culture progressed in architecture and arts, reaching its apogee in the “late
palatial” phase (1 7 0 0 -1 4 5 0 b.c.). At this time, the Minoans expanded and
adorned their “palaces” with beautiful frescoes, paved their streets with
cobblestones, and built towns with two-story villas and plumbing.
At their height in the sixteenth century b.c., the Minoans were one of
the most important trading powers in the eastern Mediterranean, form
ing a network with Greece, Egypt, Asia Minor, the Levantine Coast, and
other Aegean Islands. Although Minoan culture centered on Crete, the
largest island in the Aegean cultural group, the same culture extended across
the Aegean. The island of Thera lies just 112 kilometers north; its remark
able city, Akrotiri, also contained two-story buildings and temples with
beautiful frescoes.
The Minoans used two writing systems, which came into use by at least
1700 b.c. The first included a series of pictorial symbols, termed Minoan
hieroglyphs. The second involved a set of signs written in straight lines across
clay tablets, termed Linear A. Unfortunately, as mentioned in the earlier
chapter on writing, neither the Minoan hieroglyphs nor Linear A have been
deciphered (that is, none of the efforts to date have been well accepted),
because these signs represent a non-Indo-European language, and there
are no fully deciphered languages to which we may compare Linear A or
the hieroglyphs. A third Minoan script, Linear B, came into use about 1450
b.c., at a time when Crete had succumbed to or assimilated with the main
land powers. For decades a mystery, the secret of Linear B was finally
revealed in 1952 when Michael Ventris, in collaboration with John Chad
wick, advanced a strong case that Linear B was an early form of Greek.
By 1400 b.c., Crete had lost its sovereignty to mainland powers who
brought with them the Greek language. Although the Linear B tablets are
decipherable, they give us less information about Minoan culture than we
would like. Similar to the earliest written records of Mesopotamia, Lin
ear B tablets consist of short lists and inventories, not extensive myths
and legends. However, they provide valuable information regarding the
names of deities worshiped in Minoan times, many of whom were ven
erated into the classical era, both on Crete and on the Greek mainland.
The Minoan civilization differed strikingly from Near Eastern civiliza
tions. Its advanced technical achievements in arts, crafts, and architecture
rivaled and, in many ways, exceeded, those of contemporaneous Egyp
tian and Mesopotamian cultures. The inhabitants of Minoan city-states
lived with one another in apparent peace: no Minoan city possessed exten
sive defensive walls. Further, Minoan culture differed in its religious expres
133 / The Minoan Religion



sion. The Minoans’ competence in arts and architecture expressed a world
view entirely different from that evident in the ancient Near East: the world
view of Crete reflected its Old European-Anatolian roots.
Temple Complexes
Since 1900, when excavation of Minoan cities began, researchers have
focused much attention on the large central buildings found in most
Minoan cities. These central buildings were certainly marvels of engi
neering: the first and largest structure, excavated at Knossos, covered about
two hectares (five acres), stood two or three stories high, and included
expansive skylights. As mentioned previously, excavators labeled these
buildings “palaces,”by analogy to the large “megarons” of the Greek main
land and the royal palaces of Near Eastern cultures. But as already noted,
the concept of a “palace,” “megaron,” or “big man’s house” set aside for
the warrior nobility did not exist in Old Europe. However, since excava
tors on Crete have found no separate administrative centers, it appears
that religious and administrative functions were consolidated. These
structures were in fact religious-administrative-economic complexes, not
palaces. Even the earliest excavators, while calling the buildings “palaces,”
noted that large sections of the structures encompassed ritual use. With
all of the connotations in mind, we can use the terms temple complexes or
temple-palaces to designate complexes that, in addition to myriad ritual
spaces, also contained administrative buildings. Into this category fall the
“palaces” of Knossos, Phaistos, Mallia, and Zakros; these, in fact, are con
glomerates, or labyrinths, of many temple complexes.
Rodney Castleden used the term temple-palace in The Knossos Labyrinth
(1990) (see also Nanno Marinatos 1993). He claims that Knossos may have
functioned very much like a medieval monastery, acquiring great wealth,
supporting a large hierarchy, and acting as a redistribution center. He sug
gests that priestesses may have presided over the complex, with any king
acting only in subordination to them.
The spectacular temple complexes, with hundreds of “horns of con
secration” (models of bulls’ horns) lining their roofs and terraces, unequiv
ocally attest to the active ritual life of the larger Cretan towns. However,
archaeological evidence also reveals that shrines and temples distin
guished smaller Cretan towns and even the countryside. The Minoans ven
erated the same deities everywhere and performed related rituals. Further,
the spiritual and secular ways of life were closely intertwined.
Nearly a century after the discovery of Knossos, scholars have finally
agreed that the term palace merely connotes a convention. It does not define
the functions and meanings of these magnificent complexes, which were
134 / The Minoan Religion



embellished with ubiquitous scenes of goddess worship and which
embraced an entirely female-oriented symbolic system. Along with the
realization that the term palace did not really apply, it has also become
obvious that no king or priest-king dominated Knossos. In fact, the very
name Minoan is a misnomer. Sir Arthur Evans originally envisioned the
legendary King Minos sitting on his throne at Knossos, long before we
ascertained the true nature of Minoan and Old European culture. The early
correlation of kingship with the Knossos temple complex created a major
stumbling block to our perception of Minoan culture.
The “dethronement” of King Minos revolutionized our views on this
most female-oriented culture. As Dorothy Cameron says in her forthcoming
book, The Lady and the Bull: An Interpretation o f Minoan Art,
The evidence of feminine influence and sensibility in Minoan art and religionin architecture and artifact, in the wall paintings which depict ceremonies con nected with the worship of a feminine deity, in the priestesses who surround her represented in figurines and paintings and in the thousands of sealstones depict ing ritualistic scenes in her honor— is too strong to be dismissed. The male pres ence shown on sealstones and in wall paintings during this peak period was as “adorant,” the description used by Evans throughout his early volumes. The adorant was shown most frequently worshipping the female deity at shrines in the sealstones. In the wall paintings, a procession of males carrying ritual objects usu ally follows behind two female figures. It was not until the slow absorption ofMyce naean influences that this characteristic rendition of the male changed into what Evans described as a more formal “militaristic” presence. Shields began to replace ritual objects and less attention was given in religious aspects, an influence which began after the peak of Minoan artistic culture had been reached.
Cameron has interpreted the architectural structure of the Knossos tem
ple complex, particularly the disparity between the west and east blocks,
as reflecting the different spiritual functions I explored in our earlier exam
ination of Neolithic religion. The west block of the temple complex reflects
regeneration (from death or winter), while the east portion embodies birth
and life giving. These themes also have parallels on Malta, where twin tem
ples differed from each other in function. Evans (1 9 2 1 -3 6 , Vol. 1) has
himself observed that the west wing of the “palace” was little more than
a conglomeration of small shrines of pillared crypts designed for ritual
use. In chapter 3 of this book I mentioned the prehistoric European belief
in the sacred, womblike, regenerative qualities of caves, and the Old Euro
pean efforts to build temples of regeneration that imitated caves. The dark,
pillared crypts of the Knossos temple complex, like the cave (and womb),
embodied regenerative qualities. These crypts preserved repositories of
precious cult objects and traces of offerings of grain and animals. The main
symbol was the double ax, consisting symbolically of two triangles joined
at the tips. Archaeologists unearthed bases for holding the huge ceremo
135 / The Minoan Religion



nial double axes and found ax images engraved on three or four sides of
pillars. The term crypt in Christian times denoted a room underneath a
church that also sheltered tombs. The Knossos crypts did not safeguard
human remains, but their womblike character is reminiscent of actual
Minoan tombs containing the same symbols of regeneration: double axes
and horns or bucrania. The pillars found in crypt shrines are also impor
tant symbols of regeneration. They are symbolically related to the stalag
mites that occur naturally in caves: both symbolize rising earth energy.
Elsewhere in Minoan art, pillars and columns alternate with the tree of
life or with the goddess herself. As we know from the Neolithic, the tri
angle and double axes were prime symbols of the goddess of death and
regeneration: both were symbols of becoming. In Old European times, ax
images adorned megalithic tomb walls and western European menhirs.
In the west temple of Knossos, we find other symbols of regeneration: the
cores of roe-deer horns (one of the animals of the goddess in her life- and
birth-giving functions), and ivory and bone inlays fashioned into a pome
granate motif. These further confirm the symbolism of rebirth. Some of
the most beautiful examples of Minoan art are the exquisite faience snake
goddess or snake priestess figurines. Of two figurines crowned by tiaras
and attired in ritual costume, their breasts exposed, one figurine lets snakes
wind around her arms, while the other holds snakes in her hands. Found
in a floor cyst repository, a storage area for sacred objects, these figurines
further stress regeneration and the chthonic aspect.
Symbolism in Minoan crypts suggests seasonal rites of renewal. Addi
tionally, personal rites of passage, a ceremony in which the initiate was
“reborn” or healed, cannot be excluded. I believe that rituals that occurred
in the dark crypts of the Knossos temple complex relate, on the one hand,
to those performed one or two thousand years earlier in the large tomb
shrines of Old Europe: Newgrange and Knowth in Ireland, and the Hal
Saflieni Hypogeum in Malta. On the other hand, they mirrored those
enacted in classical times, such as the Mysteries of Eleusis in Greece. The
ceremonies of initiation at Eleusis, accompanied by music and dance, sym
bolically imitated death and resurrection.
While the crypt-shrines of the west wing of the Knossos temple com
plex possessed a dark, womblike atmosphere appropriate to regenerative
rites, the east quarter projected an entirely different ambiance. This wing
held no basements and no darkness; instead, it reflected light and gaiety
and extravagant color. It contained halls, “reception rooms,” open light
areas, and the so-called Queen’s Megaron, with murals and painted reliefs.
Breasts decorated cult vessels; spirals and breasts adorned ceilings; dol
phins, spirals, and rosettes enhanced walls. This wing celebrated birth and
136 / The Minoan Religion



life. A giant wooden statue of the goddess measuring about three meters
tall and adorned with bronze locks of hair stood in the great East Hall. It
parallels the immense statue of the goddess in the Tanden temple of Malta
(Fig. 75, above). The presence of the large statue of the goddess in the
East Hall confirms that the east quarter was dedicated to the goddess; the
vivid breasts, dolphins, rosettes, and spirals evidence that the goddess was
worshiped in her life-giving aspect.
A significant feature of the west wing of the Knossos temple complex
is the “throne room,” which contains an elevated seat obviously intended
for some important ceremonial function. In the decades since Arthur Evans
uncovered Knossos, the throne was considered the seat of honor for a king
(such as the mythical Minos), which gave Minoan culture an undeservedly
militaristic and patriarchal quality. But a number of researchers, includ
ing Helga Reusch, Sinclair Hood, Emmett L. Bennett, Henri Van Effen
terre, W D. Niemeier, and Nanno Marinatos, have challenged the
plausibility of assuming a Minoan culture based upon male royalty, whose
ceremonial power would have focused on the “throne room.”
In fact, the symbolism of the frescoes surrounding the throne does not
represent a king at all: it is the symbolism associated with the goddess
known from many other representations of her. The throne and the door
leading to a preparation room are flanked by palms and griffins (mythi
cal beings with the head of a bird and the body of a lioness). In the fres
coes, the griffins have crests of plume, curled as spirals; a rosette on the
body; necklaces; and groups of three lily stems over their bodies. The
heraldic scene of the goddess between the animals (dogs, griffins, lions)
is repeated many times on Minoan seals. The seat back of the throne has
curving sides decorated with semicircles and a protrusion on top (it is
actually roughly anthropomorphic). As Castleden has suggested, the
throne mirrors the shape of a mountain summit, as portrayed on a rhy
ton from Zakros where it is flanked by he-goats. It is quite possible that
the mountain summit symbolized the goddess herself. In fact, a hill with
a protrusion or an omphalos is a well-known symbol of the goddess in
megalithic western Europe (Fig. 52a, above), in ancient Greece, and in
later cultural areas as well. The seat face displays an omphalos with the
full moon: symbols of concentrated life force. Moon, triads, spirals, lilies,
omphalos: all familiar symbols of the goddess inherited from earlier times.
The “throne room” obviously served ceremonial, not secular, purposes.
We can easily envision the rituals that took place here. In the adjoining
preparation room, the priestess was dressed in festive, symbolic attire. She
appeared at the door, flanked with sphinxes, and then advanced to the
throne, where she received offerings brought through the same door from
137 / The Minoan Religion



the service section (a suite of rooms that included tables, benches, and
low stone seats next to the preparation room). The priestess became the
earthly representation of the goddess.
A lustral basin stood across the room and down several steps. Its pres
ence reveals a ritual that may have included descending to be cleansed
with water and fragrant oils, and ascending again, renewed. Many lustral
basins occur in Knossos and other Minoan temples. They convey that the
worship of the goddess involved a ritual of cleansing and renewal, and
that it was continually practiced. Lustral basins have predecessors in Malta,
Newgrange, and Knowth, in the fourth millennium b .c . This type of rit
ual was another aspect of Minoan religion inherited from Old Europe.
The functions served by temples in Crete during the early and mid
second millennium b .c . have deep roots in Old Europe and Old Anato
lia. The large edifices at Knossos, Phaistos, Mallia, and Zakros seem to
have functioned mainly as “temples of regeneration” that concerned the
passage from death to life. They joyously celebrated birth and the flow
ering of life. The presence of the goddess radiated from the west and east
quarters through her thrones, sculptures, and, especially, her symbolism.
Minoan temple complexes grew to gigantic architectural proportions and
great ceremonial complexity, but at their core they closely resembled the
temples of regeneration in Europe and Anatolia dating some three to four
thousand years earlier.
Cave Sanctuaries
Worshipers used caves as sanctuaries from the Upper Paleolithic through
the Neolithic. These caves are an important part of the Minoan archaeo
logical repertoire.3 Not every cave was sacred. The Minoans regarded only
those caves with special properties important: specifically, those that con
tained chambers, passages, stalagmites, wells of pure water. Their partic
ular shape, darkness, and damp walls symbolically connected the cave to
the tomb and the womb. The pillared crypts in Minoan temples resem
bled human-created caves. But caves themselves made more dramatic and
powerful religious sanctuaries than crypts, with their often remote set
tings, fantastically shaped stalagmites and stalactites, and shadowy inte
riors illumined only by torches or lamps. Some giant temples maintained
their own cave sanctuaries. Phaistos used the Kamares cave, located at an
altitude of 1,524 meters and only accessible during certain seasons. Knos
sos was served by the huge Skoteino cave and the smaller Eileithyia, both
of which were special regional cult locales. The larger religious centers
appear to have organized pilgrimages to these sacred places.
Exploration of the cave sanctuaries has brought to light several reli
138 / The Minoan Religion



gious artifacts, such as altars, vessels, offering tables, and symbolic objects
that reflect the same regenerative themes as tombs and crypts. Pottery from
the Middle and Late Minoan periods constituted the most ubiquitous find,
including Kamares “eggshell” cups and magnificent vases produced in the
Phaistos temple complex. Other artifacts recovered from cave sanctuar
ies include the familiar manifestations of the goddess of death and regen
eration, including sacred horns, double axes (of gold, silver, and bronze),
and seals and plaques engraved with a tree of life growing from the cen
ter of the sacred horns. Some finds suggest the presence of pilgrims and
priestesses in caves. Archaeologists have uncovered votive offerings, some
with inscriptions, and a considerable number of figures of male votaries
saluting with their right arm. A seal from the Idean cave shows a priest
ess holding a triton shell standing in front of an altar bearing a pair of
horns, with a tree of life in the middle and individual trees flanking the
horns on either side.
Several Cretan caves are clearly associated with birth giving: the Eilei
thyia cave at Amnissos (the harbor town mentioned by Homer in The
Odyssey) and the Dikte cave in the Lasithi Plain. To this day, these caves
carry their ancient names. The goddess Eileithyia (which is not a confirmed
Indo-European name), to whom offerings of honey were made, is men
tioned as early as the Linear B tablets from Knossos (around 1400 b .c .).
In classical Greek myth and ritual she is known as Artemis Eileithyia, the
Artemis who presides over birth. Rites of renewal and celebrations of the
birth of the divine child were most likely performed in caves.
Peak Sanctuaries
Like caves, mountain peaks evoked a sense of power and sacredness. Many
legendary deities lived on mountaintops, and even recently Greek peas
ants believed that a tall goddess dwelled there. In Minoan Crete, peak tem
ples appeared around 200 0 b .c . and continued throughout the second
millennium, in some cases into Greek and Roman times. Archaeologists
have discovered several impressive temples on Cretan mountain peaks,
such as those at Juktas (located near Arkhanes, not far from Knossos),
Petsofas (near Palaikastro in eastern Crete), and Traostalos (north of
Zakros). These temples contained three or more rooms and were deco
rated with horns.
We can deduce what peak sanctuaries symbolized from their portray
als on stone rhytons found in Zakros and Gypsades (near Knossos). Each
of the buildings depicted has a tripartite facade and walls topped with
horns. The anthropomorphic hill or mountain embodying the goddess
herself, flanked by pairs of mountain goats, decorates the central niche
139 / The Minoan Religion



as depicted on the Zakros rhyton. Birds top the smaller side niches. The
rhyton further illustrates several kinds of altars below the shrines on stairs
or rocks, suggesting that votaries left offerings. The Gypsades’ portrayal
of a peak sanctuary even includes a worshiper or pilgrim depositing offer
ings in a basket placed on a rock. At peak sanctuaries, archaeologists have
found accumulations of offerings not only on altars but also, in the case
of Juktas, in crevices and deep chasms. Ash layers attest to great bonfires
that were lit on special occasions.
Symbols unearthed in peak sanctuaries correlate with those found in
caves and crypts: horns, double axes, bulls, birds, beetles, and anthro
pomorphic figurines. These again indicate the presence of regenerative
rites. Some female figurines exhibit snakes in their crown or headdress;
many other figurines simply seem to depict worshipers (votaries) with
crossed arms on the chest. Certain artifacts suggest additional functions
of the peak sanctuaries. In the temple of Juktas, excavators found small
models of birthing women, a female with a swollen leg, and women with
deformed bodies. Other figurines portrayed sheep and cattle. (For illus
trations of ex votos, see Rutkowski 1986.) These shrines apparently offered
healing and help in delivery, in addition to serving as sites of the main rit
uals of life renewal. The goddess portrayed on seals as standing on a moun
tain peak holding a power symbol is obviously the same regenerator and
healer found in crypts, caves, and temples.
A widely reproduced National Geographic article (see Sakellarakis and
Sakellarakis 1981) portrays peak sanctuaries as places of blood sacrifice
that was performed before an impending natural catastrophe to propiti
ate the goddess. The excavations of Yannis and Efi Sakellarakis (1981)
promoted this scenario. They unearthed the small triple temple of Anemo
spilia on the northern slope of Mount Juktas, dating from about 1700 b.c.
In the central shrine, a life-sized wooden statue stood on an altar; the north
ern shrine held an altar-shaped sacrificial table. On this table rested the
remains of a seventeen-year-old youth tightly folded up, feet to buttocks.
His throat, the excavators presumed, was slit with the bronze dagger
engraved with a boar’s head that sat beside the boy. A robust, thirty-year
old man lay on the floor beside the body. The excavators imagined that
the man may have killed the boy minutes before the building collapsed.
They also exhumed a woman’s body nearby. Outside the doorway to the
central shrine, where the statue stood, the archaeologists found yet
another male or female skeleton. All of them were entombed in situ dur
ing the earthquake that coincided with the ritual. Is this a clear case of a
human sacrifice? According to Nanno Marinatos, the evidence for human
sacrifice is far from conclusive.4 We certainly need much more evidence
to conclude that this civilization practiced human sacrifice.
140 / The Minoan Religion



Cult Equipment
The ritual artifacts found in Minoan caves, temples, and mountain peak
sanctuaries continued the rich Neolithic religious tradition, reflecting beliefs
and ways of worship that the Minoans inherited from Old Europe. Both
the Minoan and the Old European-Anatolian cultures shared several cat
egories of ritual objects: tripods, rhytons, and movable altars; special tables
with depressions for offerings; benchlike altars along the wall which held
vases, figurines, and symbolic items; kem oi uniting several (as many as
nine) cups to a common base (for offering different kinds of grain,
legumes, oil, honey, milk, wool, etc.); ornithomorphic (bird-shaped),
zoomorphic, and anthropomorphic vases for libations or other purposes.
This continuity in ritual objects evidences a long-lasting tradition in rit
ual functions. Much of the Minoan cult equipment (rhytons, for exam
ple) exhibits superb beauty and workmanship that surpasses Neolithic
equipment. Some Old European artifacts, however, such as their omitho
morphic, zoomorphic, and anthropomorphic vases, equal those of the
Minoans.
Bull-Leaping
Preoccupation with bulls characterizes Minoan religion, as attested by the
famous bull-leaping frescoes and depictions on sealstones dating from the
fifteenth century b.c. Other bull-related artifacts, particularly the “horns
of consecration,” occur in religious contexts at many sites on Crete. The
bullfighting tradition of modem Spain, Portugal, Turkey, and elsewhere
very likely derives from Minoan bull games. The modern bullfighting
“sport,” however, is cruel. Minoan portrayals do not show infuriating
injuries inflicted on the bulls; they depict only an elegant sport. The Bull
Leaper fresco from the Knossos labyrinth shows three acrobats perform
ing: a youth (shown in black), who leaps from the direction of the bull’s
horns over its back with hands pressing down on the bull’s spine and body
arched over the bull’s tail; and two girls (shown in white): one holds the
bull’s horns, while the other waits with outstretched arms behind the bull
to catch the youth.5 Another exquisite representation shows the bull with
its forelegs resting on a large rectangular block and a youth vaulting through
the horns. Having the bull’s forelegs on a block certainly would have made
it easier for the acrobat to make his or her jump through the horns. A
large stone block was found in the central Phaistos court. J. W Graham
(1987) assumes that the acrobats used it in the beginning of a bull game,
and that bull games may have taken place in the central courts of temple
complexes.
141 / The Minoan Religion



The Minoan preoccupation with the bull and its horns reflects an Old
European tradition. In Old Europe, the bull was sacred to the goddess of
death and regeneration; the bucrania and bull’s horns were symbols of
her regenerative powers, present in tombs and temples of regeneration.
In Minoan Crete, the presence of the bull and its horns in so many aspects
of Minoan life— frescoes, sealstones, and architecture— simply expresses
their belief in regeneration.
Goddesses and Gods
Because Minoan religious continuity with Old Europe survived unbro
ken, Minoan religion embraced many deities descended from Old Euro
pean goddesses and gods. The best-known Minoan goddess, portrayed
in seals, rings, frescoes, and sculptures, is the young goddess whom we
identify with the Neolithic goddess of regeneration. Depictions show her
surrounded by animals and plants. Minoan art abundantly reflects regen
erative symbols: double axes, butterflies, bucrania, and trees (or columns)
of life. An exceptional portrayal of this goddess comes from the Xeste 3
temple on the island of Thera. Here, the Fresco of Crocus Gatherers pic
tures this goddess seated high on a throne on a tripartite platform, flanked
by a griffin and a monkey. Young girls bring her flowers in baskets. She
is exquisitely dressed in a crocus costume and adorned with necklaces of
ducks and dragonflies. Large golden hoops hang from her ears. Her dress
harmonizes with the marshy landscape; she is mistress of nature. Nanno
Marinatos (1984) more specifically describes her as the spring renewal of
the mistress of nature. Ritual vases from the same Theran temple depict
flying swallows, lilies, and crocuses. Scenes of nature depicted in frescoes
and painted on vases at Knossos and Thera allude to the concept of spring
fecundity and abundance.
The young, strong, bare-breasted goddess is also portrayed on sealstones
flanked by griffins or lionesses. The sealstone from Knossos shows her
standing on a mountain peak holding a scepter; a worshiper salutes her
and a columnar temple with sacred horns, perhaps Knossos, appears
behind her. Another seal from Knossos depicts her seated on a tripartite
platform with lions flanking her. A seal from the cave of Dikte displays
the tall, strong goddess holding triple horns above her head. Several seals
depict her holding waterbirds.
On other seals and rings, the goddess receives gifts while seated. On
the seal from Knossos, a woman, probably a priestess, brings her a large
vase with two circular handles. In this scene, the goddess sits under a lush
tree and holds her bare breasts with her left hand. A large double ax appears
142 / The Minoan Religion



between her and the priestess, and a crescent moon and sun (or full moon)
float in the sky above her.
A common Minoan religious symbol related to the goddess of regen
eration is the labrys, or double ax. It frequently appears in crypts, tombs,
and temples, often depicted emerging from between the sacred horns. It
is the main symbol of this goddess in her regenerative aspect. Often the
ax is portrayed in an anthropomorphic form with a human head; at other
times the ax stem is shown as a tree. This goddess embodied by the dou
ble ax was the major deity worshiped at the Knossos temple complex. One
of the Linear B (Mycenaean Greek) tablets recovered from the Knossos
archive refers to a honey offering dedicated to “da-pu-ri-to-jo po-ti-ni-ja.”
Linguistically, Mycenaean Greek da-pu-ri-to-jo is related to the classical
Greek word laburinthos (labyrinth), a name attributed to the Knossos tem
ple complex. Po-ti-ni-ja (potnia) means “lady” or “queen.” The offering of
honey was bestowed upon “Our Lady (or Queen) of the Labyrinth” (i.e.,
the Knossos temple complex).
This goddess figures most prominently in the art of Middle Minoan
Crete. Arthur Evans called her the “Great Minoan Goddess.” She survived
into the subsequent Achaean and classical Greek periods, and writings
left by Greek and Latin authors have preserved her names. In classical
antiquity, different names and epithets identified the same deity in dif
ferent localities, and the Minoan goddess of regeneration too has many
names. One of her names was Britomartis, “Sweet Virgin” (or “Sweet Maid”),
which stresses her youthfulness and beauty. On the island of Aegina, she
was worshiped as Aphaia. Another of her names was Diktynna, which some
scholars link to diktyon, “net.”Legends recount that this goddess was saved
by fishermen after she had thrown herself into the sea to escape pursuit
by Minos; but this may be a false etymology. In fact, the connection of the
goddess with the net possibly began much earlier than this Greek legend.
The net symbol, which begins in the Paleolithic and continues through
out the Neolithic and Minoan eras, correlates with birth giving, life-giving
water, and amniotic fluid. The names of the Cretan cave Dikte and the
mountain Dikte very likely derive from the worship of this goddess in caves
and on mountain peaks.
The connection with life-giving fluid leads to her aspect as the god
dess of childbirth, Eileithyia. This name is connected with the cave at
Amnissos. She is described by Homer as mogostokos, or “goddess of the
pains of birth.” Another of her epithets, Phytia, means “she who stimu
lates growth.” On Roman coins from imperial times, Diktynna is shown
holding a youth: Zeus (the Cretan Zeus was a divine child; the Greek Zeus
was a latecomer who replaced the pre-Indo-European divine child).
143 / The Minoan Religion



Artemis, worshiped in both classical and Hellenistic Greece, is the same
goddess and is associated with the cave on Akrotiri in western Crete. This
cave is called Arkoudia, “Cave of the She Bear,” in our times still sacred
to the Virgin, who has a local name, Panagia Arkoudiotissa, “Our Lady,
the (Sweet) Bear.”Even in the classical era, Artemis is linked with the bear,
as we shall discuss later. Thus we can see a link between Artemis and the
bear mother, well evidenced in Neolithic sculptural art. The names used
for this goddess through various places and periods shed light on her many
aspects: she is young and beautiful, she is goddess of childbirth, she has
the power to stimulate growth, and she is the bear mother nursing the
divine child.
In the earlier chapters on Old European religion, I recounted the close
connection between life and death: the goddess was life giver as well as
death wielder. With symbols of regeneration figuring so prominently in
Minoan art, we would expect the death aspect of the goddess to be man
ifest in the dark cave sanctuaries and crypts of Crete. But this is not the
case. Life, rather than death, primarily characterized Minoan culture. Nev
ertheless, the image of the vulture goddess presented one aspect of the
goddess of death to the Minoans. On seals and rings she exhibits a vul
ture or raptor head with large wings, but she also may have large bare
breasts: a sign that she is the goddess not only of death, but of regenera
tion. Clearly, she derives from the Neolithic bird goddess and gives rise
to the Greek Athena. Athena’s name, which is not Indo-European, appears
in the texts of Mycenaean Crete. One Knossos tablet (V 52) contains a
dedication to a-ta-na po-ti-ni-ja, “Lady (Mistress) Atana.”6 The stiff nude
of marble or alabaster, the tomb goddess inherited from the Neolithic, rep
resents the same goddess. She wears a mask with a large nose7 and has a
large life-regenerative pubic triangle (Fig. 13, above), so again, the empha
sis is on life and regeneration.
The Minoan snake goddess possesses snake limbs or snakes writhing
in her crown, as in the Neolithic. The famous faience sculptures from the
Knossos temple repositories appear beautifully attired, with bare breasts,
and snakes crawling up their arms, entwined around their waist, or held
in their hands. These sculptures may represent the snake goddess or priest
esses performing snake dances or other rituals connected with life’s regen
eration after the winter season. Figurines holding birds or portrayed with
a dove on the head and with upraised arms, as found in the Tomb of the
Double Axes (this is both a tomb and a shrine) at Knossos, also harmo
nize with the theme of spring regeneration.
The pregnant vegetation goddess, whose figurines inundate European
Neolithic sites, is absent in Cretan archaeological remains. But her mem
ory is preserved in legends and written sources, which record two Cre
144 / The Minoan Religion



tan goddesses of vegetation: Ariadne and Demeter. According to the Home
ric Hymn to Demeter, this goddess came to Greece from Crete. Each mar
ried a god: Ariadne was wed to Dionysus,8 and Demeter married Iasion.9
At Naxos, Ariadne had two festivals, one of them celebrating her mar
riage, the other mourning her death. This goddess died annually, as did
her consort, the god of vegetation, in order to bring new fertility in the
spring. The classical myth depicting the death of both female and male
vegetation deities very likely derives from Neolithic Europe, as shown by
burial of the pensive female and male figures (perhaps representing
deities) in a Cemavoda grave of the Hamangia culture in Romania, dat
ing from the early fifth millennium b.c. The death of the female vegeta
tion goddess is a local tradition, and it is unlikely that the Old Europeans
imported it from the Near East. Mourning and lamentations of female
deities do not occur in Eastern cults, in whose myths only the male god
dies. In Greek myths of Demeter the mother and Persephone the maid,
Persephone, the spirit of the grain, dies and is bom again. Seeds from har
vest time were kept in underground pits so that they could be fertilized
by contact with the dead. Persephone symbolized dying vegetation, as her
mother, Demeter, represented revived and growing vegetation.
Another Minoan deity whose primary evidence comes from legends
and written records, but whom archaeology also supports, is a young dying
god who is bom in a cave, the cave of Dikte, and nursed by the goddess
Dikte. Minoan seals depict the young god. One seal from Kydonia shows
the god rising from horns like a tree of life and flanked by mythical ani
mals: a winged goat and a “daemon” with an animal head who holds a
pitcher. Other seals or sealings depict him as a “master of animals” hold
ing animals or birds, a parallel image to the goddess as “mistress of ani
mals.”Another male deity well known in Neolithic imagery, the sorrowful
dying god, does not occur in Minoan portrayals. But like the young god
bom in the cave, the sorrowful god inhabits legends that recount the death
of Dionysus, Linos, Cretan Zeus, Velchanos, and Hyakinthos. Minoan
Velchanos endured into the classical period as one of the titles attributed
to Zeus on Crete: “Zeus Velchanos.”Here he was a kouros, a “young man.”10
Poseidon, the principal Mycenaean god, mled not only the sea and the
earth but also horses and earthquakes. Originally, he may have been a
Minoan god, a counterpart of the earth mother. In Homeric Greek his name
was Poseidaon; the earlier form was Poteidaon. This name allegedly ety
mologizes as “lord of the Earth” from Indo-European potis, “lord,” and da,
“earth” (cf. Demeter from da m ater).11 This etymology and his association
with horses suggests an Indo-European influence for Poseidon’s origin,
but the association with the sea and earth suggests earlier (i.e., pre-Indo
European) roots. Analogous pre-Indo-European deities occur in other Euro
145 / The Minoan Religion



pean regions: for instance, Germanic Njprdr, god of the sea and earth, a
male counterpart of Nerthus, the earth mother. Linear B tablets found at
Pylos recount Poseidon receiving sacrificial offerings, in several cases along
side a female deity, po-si-da-e-ja (dative case: Posidaeiai). Together they
receive an offering of a cow, ewe, boar, and sow: typical offerings to the
earth mother known from later Roman rituals.
In Castleden’s estimation (1990), a clay sealing known as the “Master’s
Impression” from Khania, dating to 1 5 0 0 -1 4 5 0 b .c ., depicts the Minoan
Poseidon as commander of the sea. In this scene, Poseidon stands on top
of a coastal temple. The god is young and strong; one arm is outstretched
and his hand holds a long staff. He has long flowing hair, and he wears a
necklace and bracelet. A gold ring from Knossos portrays the same type
of god, longhaired and holding a staff. He is shown hovering next to a pil
lar and tree shrine. Clearly, this god inspired Minoan iconographers, but
we need more evidence to identify him with Poseidon. Generally, in Minoan
art, male deities appear as vegetation gods and are associated with ani
mals. In these aspects, they are counterparts of the female deities. Even
the strong god holding a staff has an iconographic parallel in the goddess
standing on a mountain peak holding a staff, her symbol of power.
Burial Rites
As in Old Europe, the archaeological evidence of Cretan funeral rites
imparts many details about the social structure and religious beliefs of Crete.
During the Neolithic era on Crete, the usual burial rite involved rock-cut
tombs or caves, as in Malta or Sardinia, or circular-chamber tholos tombs.
Tholos tombs occur mostly in the Mesara Plain of southern Crete. These
tombs hold hundreds of burials, which date to the Early Bronze Age (the
third millennium b .c .). It seems that clans used the tombs, and often two
tombs stand together. They house collective burials, with individual
remains treated in the same way.12 The custom of collective burial in Crete
relates to the collective burials in western European megalithic graves dur
ing the fourth and third millennia b .c . As in the western European case,
the Cretan burials reflect a society based on clans. Some of the collective
tombs had pillared chambers reminiscent of cave stalagmites and pillared
crypts. Offerings left outside the tomb indicate funereal feasts or memo
rials celebrated on specific days after the deposition of the bones. Typi
cally, finds include stone kem oi and libation cups. Excavators also found
clay models of shrines with pillars, such as that at Kamilari, near Phais
tos. Here, an open model of a rectangular building with two pillars fram
ing the facade contained four human figures seated on stools in front of
offering tables, while votaries entered the shrine carrying cups. Another
146 / The Minoan Religion



model of a round building, possibly a copy of a tholos tomb, included two
people sitting on either side of a low table. The models seem to replicate
funereal meals. Such feasts did not honor individuals but communally
celebrated the return of the dead to their ancestors and the ancestral home.
In some southern Cretan areas the custom of collective burial lasted until
the end of the fifteenth century b .c . We have discovered no royal tomb
from the period before about 1450 b .c .; small tombs and single burials
appear in Crete only after this time. The change from collective tribal bur
ial to individual interment coincides with the appearance of Mycenaean
influences from mainland Greece.
However, there were some exceptionally rich burials among the
Minoans, in which individuals were buried in sarcophagi,13 on which the
symbolism of regeneration appears. As in crypts, horns of consecration
with a double ax (or butterfly) rising from the center dominate the iconog
raphy. Next to the double axes, surrounded by plant, fish, and marine
motifs, and by wavy lines, are vertical columns of spirals, arcs, semicir
cles, or snakes. Some sarcophagi portray winged griffins, and octopuses
with human faces or even with breasts. Several sarcophagi from Rethym
non, now in the Khania museum, feature painted bulls on birds of prey:
a remarkable combination of a bull with the vulture goddess.
The most celebrated sarcophagus, dating from the Mycenaean occu
pation of Crete (circa 1400 b .c .), from Hagia Triada, southern Crete, has
been reproduced many times by various authors. The painted scenes on
all four panels constitute a treasure trove for interpreting burial rituals.
One of the long sides portrays several women, probably singing, preceded
by a male flute player. The center bears an ornate sacrificial scene: a bull
is tied to a table and his blood pours into a vessel; below the table two
goats wait to be sacrificed; to the right, in front of an altar, a priestess places
a vessel with offerings; a libation jug and a fruit basket with fruit appear
above the altar, behind which stands an obelisk crowned by a double ax
on which perches a bird; in the background appears a structure topped
by horns enclosing a tree of life. One of the narrow sides shows the arrival
of two goddesses at the shrine, in a chariot drawn by winged griffins. A
large bird perches on the wings of one griffin. The other long side pic
tures an armless dead man behind a stepped altar in front of his tomb (or
shrine). Three men carry offerings to him: a boat and two calves. To the
left, several people appear in a procession, including a male lyre player,
a woman carrying pails, and a priestess pouring liquid into a vessel between
two poles, which have double axes on top. The second narrow panel
includes again two females in a chariot drawn by wild goats. The two are
very likely the same goddesses linked with death and regeneration, per
haps a mother-daughter pair.14
147 / The Minoan Religion



Over the years, researchers have offered two interpretations of the scenes
on the Hagia Triada sarcophagus. They may portray the burial of the arm
less man. Alternatively, the scenes could depict the resurrection of the veg
etation god (Veiovis, according to Gjerstad 1973) in the spring. W hich is
right? The participation of the goddess (or goddesses), bull sacrifice, liba
tions, double axes on columns, and trees of life seem to belong to regen
erative rites. The boat offered to the man very likely supported his
journey across the water to the other world. Funerary rites also entail pro
cessions with music. So we have more justification for burial rites than
for the rebirth of a young god.15
Fall o f Minoan Culture
Minoan civilization reached its height during the two and a half centuries
between about 1700 b .c . and 1450 b .c ., in spite of natural and human
made disasters that afflicted the island of Crete. One of the most calami
tous natural disasters recorded in historical times played a part in Crete’s
downfall. One hundred and twelve kilometers north of Crete is the island
of Thera, which was either a Minoan outpost or an independent people
possessing a closely related culture. But the island itself was actually the
tip of a long-dormant volcano. Probably in 1628 or 1627 b .c ., the volcano
erupted with a force comparable to the 1883 explosion of Krakatoa Island
in Indonesia.16 Krakatoa’s explosion created giant waves that devastated
large portions of the South Pacific Islands. The volcanic eruption on Thera
decimated much of that island, leaving a water-filled volcanic crater some
12.8 kilometers across and nearly 4 0 0 meters deep. On the remaining
portion of the island, two-story buildings in the community of Akrotiri
survived under tons of volcanic ash. We are reminded of the Italic cities
of Pompeii and Herculaneum, which met the same fate over a millen
nium later. Like Pompei and Herculaneum, Akrotiri would also remain
buried intact under volcanic debris for millennia until excavations in this
century.
The explosion of the volcano at Thera produced a giant tidal wave that
swept the coasts of mainland Greece and the north shore of Crete. Dev
astation occurred along much of the north shore of Crete, which held many
large Minoan cities. Both the existence of the volcano at Thera, and the
fact of its eruption in prehistory, were only recently discovered, in the
1960s, by Spiridon Marinatos, the excavator of Thera. At first some schol
ars speculated that this eruption may have completely explained the fall
of Minoan culture, which occurred shortly thereafter. But closer analysis
shows that the eruption did not totally annihilate Minoan culture. Settle
ments inland and on the south shore of the island remained unaffected.
148 / The Minoan Religion



On the ravaged northern shore, excavations confirm new layers of con
struction over the devastation. For at least fifty years after the explosion,
then, the Minoans continued to rebuild their culture.
Although Minoan culture may have been weakened by Thera’s cata
strophic explosion, its ultimate collapse came through human, not nat
ural, intervention. For many centuries, Crete had escaped the fate of
mainland Greece, which had been engulfed by Indo-European tribes. But
around 1450 b .c , chaos assaulted Crete, not only along the coast but across
the entire island. All communities show signs of burning and destruction,
as if ransacked by invaders. Many locales repeat the pattern of earlier Old
European sites: the Old European layers end abruptly with a destroyed
stratum, buried beneath a new occupation that possessed different arti
facts, architecture, and artistic styles. During this phase, known archaeo
logically as the “late palatial,” the resulting Cretan culture was an amalgam
of Old European and Indo-European elements.
Conclusions
The Minoan culture flowered for several hundred years. The period of
Minoan “civilization,” which meets the criteria of advanced artistic and
architectural technologies, dates from circa 2000 b .c . Minoan culture had
deep roots in Old Europe and Old Anatolia, evidenced by its artistic cre
ativity, its theacentric social structure, and its symbolism of griffins, spi
rals, palms, lilies, moons, snakes, birds, and the labrys, the double ax.
Minoan art celebrated life and nature; we have evidence of the goddess
of birth and life: standing on a mountain peak; on a tripartite platform
flanked by lions; holding waterbirds. Thus the Minoan goddess or god
desses continued Old European traditions. Although female figures greatly
outnumber male figures in excavated Minoan artifacts, the Minoans also
depicted, in their iconography, the young year god.
The peoples of Crete also invented two writing systems, a hieroglyphic
script and a linear script, Linear A; upon the latter, the Mycenaeans built
their own script, Linear B. Many of the deities whom we know from archaic
and classical Greece— Hera, Artemis, Athena, Poseidon, and others— are
listed in the Linear B inscriptions, giving evidence of their long continuity.
The centers of Minoan culture were originally thought to have been
palaces, with the hierarchical and patriarchal connotations implied by that
term. Now we know that those “palaces”were in reality temple complexes,
and that the culture was goddess-centered. Whereas the temple complexes
were administrative as well as religious centers, cave sanctuaries and
mountain-peak sanctuaries probably focused upon ritual. In these sanc
tuaries were found sacred horns, double axes, and seals engraved with a
149 / The Minoan Religion



tree of life: all themes of regeneration. The Minoans celebrated the pas
sage from death to rebirth. Thus, the Minoans continued the Neolithic artistic and goddess
centered cultures. Further evidence of this continuation is to be found in
the Minoan tradition of collective burials, distinct from the single burials
of the Indo-European cultures.17 With the fall of the Minoan culture, the last of the Old European
Anatolian civilizations disappeared. But the Minoans and other Old Euro
pean cultures would strongly influence the ancient world: an influence
that has lingered through the modem era.
150 / The Minoan Religion



CHAPTER EIGHT
The Greek Religion
T
he classical era of Greece flourished almost a millennium after the
first Greek culture developed in Greece. The first Greek culture, known
as the Mycenaean, flourished about 1300 b.c.; its writing system, Linear
B, was derived from the yet-undeciphered Linear A of the Minoans, and
its art is quite similar to that of the Minoans as well. This chapter dis
cusses the two forms of Greek culture.1
The Mycenaean Period
Most scholars agree that the Mycenaeans, whose culture formed in Greece
in the wake of earlier Indo-European incursions, conquered the Minoan
cities. The Mycenaeans came to prominence in the Peloponnese around
1600 b.c., and their centers consisted of heavily fortified cities on the
Peloponnese Peninsula. The most notable is Mycenae, whose massive for
tified walls still stand. Prior to the mid-nineteenth century, scholars as
sumed that the Mycenaeans only existed in Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey.
Heinrich Schliemann first uncovered the existence of the Mycenaeans as
an actual people. He started excavating the ruins of Mycenae in 1876,
after completing his excavations of Troy in Asia Minor. From the begin
ning, Schliemann sought to prove the historical reality of the Homeric poems.
The Mycenaeans adopted many elements from Minoan culture. Clay
tablets written in Mycenaean Linear B occur both on Crete and in Myce
naean cities on the mainland. The tablets mostly preserve short lists and
inventories, but importantly, they include names of deities worshiped in
later classical Greece, such as Zeus, Hera, Athena, Artemis Eileithyia, Posei
don, Dionysus, Ares, and possibly (under a different name) Apollo. Unfor
151



tunately, the tablets only give us the names of goddesses and gods. They
reveal little about their mythologies or the characteristics the Mycenaeans
attributed to these deities; in fact, the Greeks did not transcribe their myths
and legends until the eighth century b.c. The Minoans also endowed the Mycenaeans with a style of arts and
crafts. The highly skilled Cretan artists apparently moved to the main
land where, under their Mycenaean masters, they produced pottery and
frescoes in the Minoan style. Many of the same symbols appear on the
mainland as on Crete, and, in fact, the art of this time in the Aegean and
on the mainland is often referred to as Mycenaean-Minoan art.
The art, architecture, and written records of the Mycenaeans reveal a
fascinating mixture of Old European and Indo-European elements. There
is no doubt about the Indo-European ancestry of the Mycenaeans. They
glorified war, and male warriors held prominence in society. Carrying on
the Kurgan burial tradition, Mycenaean graves feature a prominent male
warrior buried with his weapons, the dagger and sword, as well as with
remarkable gold artifacts.2 Their pantheon featured male warrior deities.
At the same time, the archaeological evidence shows that the Mycenaeans
retained strong Old European-Minoan beliefs. Much of the artwork
frescoes, signet rings and seals, pottery, and figurines— is quite similar to
the Minoan. The same goddesses and symbols— the mistress of animals
and mountains, the snake and bird goddesses, the horns of consecration,
and the double ax— all occur in mainland Mycenaean art. We find both
male and female deities in sanctuaries, with the female deities outnum
bering the male. The Mycenaeans produced thousands of goddess figurines,
which descend directly from Old European motifs. Full-sized ceramic mod
els of snakes, recovered from shrine storerooms, number among the most
remarkable Mycenaean artifacts. They clearly indicate the importance of
the snake cult at this time. The Mycenaean civilization demonstrates that significant worship of
the goddess persisted in Bronze Age Europe, even within heavily Indo
Europeanized cultures. The Mycenaeans represent an important tran
sitional phase between Old European gynocentric culture and the classical
Greek culture, where the male element came to dominate almost
completely. The Mycenaeans, who were themselves descended from earlier Indo
Europeanized tribes from the north (central Europe), eventually suc
cumbed to more militarized Indo-Europeans. Around 1200 b.c., a new
wave of peoples from central Europe swept through Greece and the
Aegean Islands. Subsequently, the Greek and Aegean Islands fell into a
Dark Age, from which, centuries later, the civilization of classical Greece
would rise.
152 / The Greek Religion



Classical Greece
During the centuries-long Dark Age that followed upon the Mycenaean
civilization, the art of writing in Linear B script disappeared, the beauti
ful Minoan-Mycenaean artistry vanished, and the great Mycenaean hill forts,
devastated by the invasions, fell into ruin. The post-Mycenaean Greeks
lived in small, scattered settlements. In spite of the cultural decay, how
ever, the Mycenaean elements shifted to later Greek culture in several ways.
The Mycenaeans spoke an archaic form of the Greek language, as demon
strated by the Linear B tablets. We can assume that Greek in some form
was spoken in this area during the centuries of the Dark Age. Religious
activity also endured, since many of the same Greek gods and goddesses
known from classical times occur several centuries earlier in Mycenaean
written records. Also, many Mycenaean cult sites, such as the sanctuar
ies of Delphi and Eleusis, continued in use through the Dark Age, flour
ishing during the classical era. Even the epic poems of Homer, the Iliad
and the Odyssey, though written down in the seventh or eighth centuries
b.c., are set in earlier Mycenaean times.
The Greek culture that arose after the Dark Age differed significantly
from the Mycenaean. We can only speculate as to the reasons for this con
trast, but one major influence came from the peoples who overran the
Mycenaeans, whom Greek tradition calls the Dorian tribes. The second
influence emerged from Anatolia and the Near East, during the so-called Orientalizing period.3
The diminished role of women in society constituted the most radical
change. In the earlier Mycenaean and Minoan civilizations, the feminine
played a central role, and (at least in Minoan Crete) women held signifi
cant positions in society. But this had changed dramatically by the classi
cal Greek era. Classical Athenian society excluded women from public
life. Women participated in almost no significant social, political, or intel
lectual activities. Classical Greek religion also narrowed the scope of the
feminine. Greek goddesses, while fulfilling roles similar to earlier Minoan
Mycenaean ones, now served male deities. Rather than a central feminine
force guiding the world, male powers dominated it. The hierarchical Greek
pantheon reflected Greek society. Zeus, the chief male deity, was descended
from the typical Indo-European warrior-god. Yet the Greek pantheon also
uneasily synthesized Old European goddesses and gods with deities cre
ated by the pastoral Indo-Europeans.
Although Greek society and religion relegated the feminine to inferior
roles, study of Greek religion assists our understanding of Old European
spirituality and its fusion with the Indo-European religion. The Greeks
left detailed written records of their religion and customs. Two of the ear
153 / The Greek Religion



liest bodies of literary works date from about the eighth and seventh cen
turies b.c.: the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey; and the Theogony
of Hesiod. The Homeric epic poems actually are set several centuries ear
lier in the Mycenaean era and recall the adventures of the heroes of the
Mycenaean city-states, their legendary ventures against Troy, and their jour
neys home. Because the epics are set in Mycenaean times, it is tempting
to use the Homeric poems as sources for Mycenaean religion. But we should
remember that the Homeric poems recount the mythology of eighth-cen
tury Greeks, which Homer then projected onto the earlier Mycenaeans.
Although a warrior society themselves, archaeological evidence shows that
the Mycenaeans still retained strong beliefs in the goddess, beliefs closely
related to those of Minoan Crete. Catastrophic changes befell the main
land during the four to five centuries between the fall of Mycenaean civ
ilization and the rise of Archaic Greece, and the feminine role eroded to
yield the familiar religion presented by Homer, where goddesses were sub
ordinate to gods.
A second important literary work is the Theogony of Hesiod. Whereas
Homer wove the intervention of Olympian deities into entertaining sto
ries, the Theogony was a strictly theological work. Hesiod wrote it to explain
the origins of the world and the deities, and the relationships of the Greek
goddesses and gods. These works, as well as later written sources, give detailed accounts of
Greek religion, including the familiar pantheon of goddesses and gods and
how they interacted with each other and the human world. The polythe
istic Greeks worshiped many deities, whose home had been removed from
the earth and transferred to lofty Mount Olympus. Male deities of the Greek
pantheon dominated both Mount Olympus and the human world. Their
primary ruler was Zeus, a form of the Indo-European sky and thunder
god. The formerly independent goddesses, while still fulfilling important
roles, become wives and daughters to the gods. Legends narrate the rape
of the goddesses by Zeus and other gods, which can be interpreted as an
allegory for the subjugation of the local goddess religion by the invaders’
patriarchal pantheon. In fact, the Greek pantheon, with its many Indo
European gods, had now become decidedly belligerent; some of the god
desses inherited from Old Europe were militarized.
By examining the written texts depicting Greek goddesses, we can gain
valuable insight into the Old European forebears, since archaeology alone
does not preserve details comparable to the comments of ancient writers.
Some of the deities were clearly continuous with Neolithic and Minoan
times. We should remember that the amalgamation of Indo-European and
Old European culture, which took place over several millennia, engen
dered the goddesses and gods of classical Greek religion. During this time,
154 / The Greek Religion



the life-affirming goddesses of Old Europe progressively mutated, taking
on Indo-European traits. This becomes obvious in the centuries before
the rise of classical Greece, during the periods known as the Archaic, Geo
metric, and Protogeometric. The classical period in Greece began around
500 b .c .; it was preceded by the Archaic period, dating from the seventh
to the sixth centuries b .c ., and by the Protogeometric and Geometric peri
ods, which date from the tenth to the eighth centuries b .c . Although the
goddess lost her primal place in the religious worldview of these times,
strong goddesses were worshiped in classical Greece.
Goddesses, Gods, and Supernatural Creatures
Hekate
Hekate in her multiple forms was descended from the Old European
goddess of life, death, and regeneration. Through Mycenaean and Greek
times she remained powerful and was worshiped with ecstatic dances. From
written sources and from what manifested in vase painting and sculptures,
she represented many phases of life: the birth giver and motherly pro
tectress, the youthful and strong virgin, as well as the fearsome and dan
gerous crone.4 These aspects are analogous to the moon’s phases— crescent,
waxing, and full— and to the cycle of life, death, and regeneration. The
writer Porphyry, in the third century a .d ., tells us that the ancients called
her the “moon.”5
Hekate mostly, however, personified death. She is a remorseless killer
who travels above graveyards collecting poison. Her animal, the dog, some
times appears with her: she is portrayed holding a torch, and she sweeps
through the night followed by her dogs. Sometimes the goddess herself
is a howling hound. In Caria, western Turkey, supplicants sacrificed dogs
to her and performed orgiastic dances in her honor. Greek writers describe
her as the mistress of night roads or crossroads who leads travelers astray.
She sometimes wears a nest of writhing snakes in her hair. Hekate’s stat
ues had enormous magic power, according to Pausanias (III: 16.7). The
resplendence of her statue in the temple of Ephesus forced those who
looked at it to cover their eyes (Ginzburg 1991, 131). Her favorite herbs
were poppy, mandragora, smilax, and aconite.
Artemis
The young and strong Artemis was goddess of spring, giving life to all
nature. As in Crete, she was revered as mistress of mountains, forest, stones,
animals, springs, and healing waters. She was especially worshiped in Arca
dia (an region where Indo-European influence was less pronounced than
155 / The Greek Religion



in other areas of Greece), where she was known as kallisto, “the most beau
tiful,” or agrotera, “the wild one.” From Pausanias, in the second century
a .d ., we hear that her statue in the Arcadian temple of the Despoina was
clothed with a deer pelt.6 She lived in the wild, untouched forests, sur
rounded by stags and hounds: the lady of free, virgin, untamed nature.
As a maiden, she raced across the mountains with her nymphs, dancing
and showering her arrows, exulting in the chase. Her nymphs dwelled in
brooks, streams, and flowers. She was Potnia Theron, “lady of wild ani
mals,” and the “stag huntress”in Homeric Hymns.7Her portrayals on vases,
ivory plaques, and elsewhere show her winged, holding cranes or geese
with her hands, flanked by stag and dog or lion. In the historical era,
Artemis, the mistress of wild things, received sacrifices of all kinds of wild
animals; in the second century a .d . Pausanias mentions deer, fawns, boars,
birds, wolf cubs, and bear cubs.8 Mycenaean Linear B tablets from Pylos
record the name Artemis as A-ti-mi-te, A-ti-mi-to.
As in Crete, Artemis remained birth giver, appearing at the birth of a
child or animal. The medicinal herb artemisia (mugwort) encouraged deliv
ery. Diana, the Roman equivalent of Artemis, was “the opener of the womb.”
In Thessaly, pregnant women sacrificed to her as Enodia,9 to ensure her
blessings at birth. Offerings to her included loom weights, spindle whorls,
and figurines seated in the birthing posture. As birth giver, Artemis was
a Fate who spins and weaves human life. The association of the birth-giv
ing Artemis with the bear constitutes another link with earlier religion.
Classical sources convey that Kallisto was turned into a bear, later becom
ing Ursa Major, and that Athenian girls danced as bears to honor Artemis
of Brauronia, a town in Attica. The motherly qualities of the bear, who is
a fierce defender and careful nurse of her young, made this animal, from
at least the Neolithic, the double of the birth-giving and protecting
goddess.
Artemis also represents regeneration. As in the Neolithic, her epipha
nies are the bee and butterfly, or those animals associated with the vulva,
fetus, and uterus: frog or toad, hedgehog, fish, and hare. As was men
tioned earlier, the goddess was worshiped as a toad in Egypt, Italy, and
Lithuania. The toad has powerful qualities similar to those of the goddess:
she can release a virulent poison that can kill people, but at the same time
she can heal.
One of the richest regenerative scenes involving Artemis-Hekate comes
from an egg-shaped amphora found in a Boeotian tomb, dating from 700
to 675 b.c . Here the goddess is surrounded by birds, swastikas, a bull’s
head, a bladder-shaped object, howling lions (or ferocious hounds), and
upward-winding snakes in separate columns. The fish holds the central
symbolic position in this scene. It floats within the body of the goddess,
156 / The Greek Religion



equated with the womb. The goddess manifests some characteristics of
an insect, perhaps a bee: serrated lines around the lower part of her body,
and zigzagging lines on each side of her head, resemble insect antennae
more than human hair. Her outstretched arms without hands suggest insect
legs. The panel on the other side of the amphora includes a large bird,
clearly mythical: it has the body of a net-patterned fish. (See Gimbutas
1989, Fig. 405.) A hare and net-pattemed triangles appear below the bird.
Snakes, spirals, swastikas, and more birds add energy to the dynamism
of this regenerative scene. The two panels on the Boeotian vase, dating
from just before the dawn of classical Greece, offer almost a full catalog
of regenerative symbols familiar to us from the Neolithic era.
In a fragment of a Greek tragedy by Aeschylus, the priestesses of Artemis
appear as bees (in Greek, melissai); the bee is another important regener
ative symbol inherited from Neolithic and then Minoan times. In the third
century a.d., Porphyry relates that souls are bees,10 and that Melissa draws
down souls to be bom. He also equates the moon with the bull (another
symbol of regeneration) and makes the fascinating assertion that cows beget
bees.11 The goddess as a bee appears in Greek jewelry of the seventh to
fifth centuries b.c. from the islands of Rhodes and Thera. Gold plaques
portray her with human head and arms, but she has wings and the body
of a bee, as well as a ridged abdomen. At Ephesus, Artemis was associ
ated with the bee as her cult animal, and the organization of the sanctu
ary in classical times may have rested on the symbolic analogy of a beehive,
with swarms of bee-priestesses, melissai, and essenes, “drones,” who were
eunuch priests.12 The bee, much as the Egyptian beetle or scarab, sym
bolizes eternal renewal.
Artemis had many insect epiphanies: the bee, the moth, the butterfly.
Her butterfly epiphany is an image descended from the Neolithic era and
then the Minoan period in Crete. It is very similar to the image of the Cre
tan labrys, the double ax. When anthropomorphic features are added to
the double ax— a circular or crowned head on a stick, a plant or a human
body in the middle, and triangles as wings— then the image is transformed
into the goddess in the aspect of a butterfly or moth. In Mycenaean times
this image was still popular, although in a more rigid form than in Minoan
art. In the Protogeometric, Geometric, and Archaic periods of Greece, the
motif became progressively more abstracted. It was integrated into orna
mental design as rows of double axes (two triangles joined at their tips)
or as X’s separated by a group of vertical lines.
Athena
Athena represents another deity descended from Old European and
Minoan prototypes. She was a popular Greek goddess venerated in many
157 / The Greek Religion



places besides Athens, especially in the Peloponnese (Argos and Sparta)
and western Turkey (Troy and Smyrna). Athena was descended from the
Old European bird and snake goddess; she was also the community pro
tectress and life sustainer, and she was associated with Greek cities. By
the fifth century b .c ., she had become firmly established as Athens’ offi
cial municipal goddess. She acquired military characteristics during the
Bronze Age, and she became the victim of a rather preposterous Olympian
myth, in which she is described as a daughter of Zeus, having sprung fully
armed from his head. The image of Greek Athena merges features acquired
from the Old European vulture goddess with several Indo-European mar
tial attributes, such as a shield, crested helmet, and long spear. On Greek
vases and in statues she appears with birds (doves, ducks, gulls, swallows,
and sea eagles, but mostly owls and vultures). Homer, in the Odyssey, tells
us that Athena can change into a vulture.13 This goddess intervened as an
owl in the battle against the Persians and helped, it was believed, to con
quer them. In vase paintings, we can see her as an owl armed with hel
met and spear. Sometimes both are shown: Athena as an anthropomorphic
goddess and behind her the owl. Homer called her “owl-faced.”14
One of Athena’s important personas is that of giver of crafts, which she
seems to have inherited from Neolithic times. This association (explored
by the author in Language o f the Goddess) can be traced in Old Europe
through signs and inscriptions incised on artifacts such as spindle whorls,
loom weights, crucibles, and musical instruments. According to Greek myth,
Athena invented the flute, trumpet, pottery, metallurgy, spinning and weav
ing, and many other aspects of civilization. A series of Greek terra-cotta
plaques shows an owl with human arms spinning wool. Spinning, weav
ing, twisting, and sewing were as commonly associated with Athena and
her Roman counterpart, Minerva, as with the Old European goddess. Priest
esses in Athena’s temple wove the peplos (a type of robe or shawl) for the
goddess. Athena is also associated with metal workshops. In one house
inside the Citadel of Mycenae, in a room adjoining a metal workshop, exca
vators discovered a fresco of a goddess, most likely Athena. Minoan cul
ture also linked the goddess with metallurgy. The cave of Arkalokhori, south
of Knossos, served as both a sanctuary and a workshop for bronze smiths.15
As an inventor of crafts and protectress of cities, Athena personified the
mother of civilized life.
Sirens and Harpies
Two supernatural creatures of Greek mythology that also manifested
the traits of birds were the Sirens and Harpies.16 These creatures, with
their antecedents in the Neolithic bird goddess, incorporate a human head,
bird’s body, and vulture’s feet. In Homer’s Odyssey, the Siren possesses the
158 / The Greek Religion



sinister ability to lure humans to their death with her song. The Sirens are
associated with music in Plato’s Republic. His tale of Er narrates the role
of music in the physical universe: the heavenly bodies dangle in trans
parent, concentric spheres that turn around a spindle, like a vast spindle
whorl. Each sphere possesses a Siren who sings its particular note, creat
ing the mystical Music of the Spheres.17
Hera
Hera (Roman Juno), a tall, majestic, and beautiful goddess, ruled pas
tureland and seafaring. The most important temples of Hera are known
from Argos, Perakhóra in Corinth, the islands of Samos and Lesbos, and
Sybaris and Foce del Sele in Italy. Artists often portrayed her as a power
ful queen positioned between two lions, comparable to the Minoan god
dess standing on the mountain. A Cycladic clay relief pithos from around
680 to 670 b .c . depicts her with a crown, from which grow sinewy branches
heavy with grapes; howling lions flank her powerful figure, and her arms
are uplifted. Two priestesses attend her sacred net-pattemed robe. One of
the most ancient Greek religious festivals, one in which only women were
permitted to participate, was held in honor of Hera; it took place at Olympia
every fourth year. For this occasion, sixteen chosen women wove a
resplendent robe for the goddess. The main event was a famous foot race
featuring virgins who ran in order of age: the youngest first, and the eldest
last. The winning virgin received an olive branch crown with an olive
wreath, and a share of a homed cow that had been especially sacrificed
to Hera.
In art and legend, Hera often consorts with cows and snakes. The lat
ter association suggests a link with the prehistoric snake goddess, the pro
tectress of family life and particularly of cows. Hera roamed the fertile plains
with cattle herds, and she accepted oxen sacrifices at her temples. Homer
called her “cow-eyed.”18 Calves, homed animals, anthropomorphic fig
urines with large eyes, and figurines of snakes number among the votive
offerings to her. Portrayals reveal her hair curling like snakes and her eye
brows in the shape of horns. Spirals, circles, and zigzags decorated her
dress. A northern European sister of Hera is Mársa or Maya, preserved in
Latvian mythological songs, called the “Mother of Cows,” “Mother of Milk,”
or “Fate of Cows.” I will discuss her further in the last chapter, on Baltic
religion.
In the Olympian pantheon, Hera was both elder sister and wife of Zeus.
Some time in the later Bronze Age, they were married, but many pictor
ial representations continued to show Hera occupying the throne while
Zeus stood at her side. She can also be seen standing over him with her
arm raised like a great-goddess, while he sits in the suppliant son-lover
159 / The Greek Religion



pose. The Iliad called her “Hera of the Golden Throne.”After centuries of
unsuccessfully pursuing Hera, Zeus won her hand through deception.
According to one myth, he disguised himself as a little cuckoo to be warmed
against Hera’s breast.19 Having gained access to Hera’s body, Zeus imme
diately revealed himself and threatened to rape her unless she married
him. Thereafter Hera personified the archetypal nagging and jealous wife;
however, she never entirely lost her powers.
Classical Greece continued the mystery ritual known as hieros gamos,
or “sacred marriage,” between Hera, or the great-goddess, and Zeus. This
reunion of goddess and god caused the earth to revive and blossom. The
Iliad contains a beautiful passage about the influence of the marriage of
Zeus and Hera: “There underneath them the divine earth broke into young,
fresh grass, and into dewy clover, crocus, and hyacinth so thick and soft
it held hard ground away from them.”20
Demeter and Persephone
Different aspects of the Neolithic pregnant vegetation goddess can be
recognized in Demeter, the queen of grain, as well as in her daughter Perse
phone, who is both grain maiden and queen of the dead. Persephone is
also known as Kore, “maiden.” Kore is the feminine form of koros, which
means “sprout” as well as “young boy.” Demeter’s sacred animal, the sow,
also came from Neolithic symbolism.
Demeter is the goddess of the earth’s fruits; she was called “the green
one,” “the bringer of fruit,” “the one who fills the bam ,” and “she who
brings the seasons.” In the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, when the goddess
comes to Eleusis disguised as an old woman, she tells people that she came
across the sea from Crete. Hence, it seems that both the Minoan and the
Greek Demeter were the same goddess. However, in the later Olympian
myth, Demeter became incorporated into the Olympian pantheon; she
became sister to Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. Zeus agreed to hand his daugh
ter Persephone over to Hades, and in some versions Poseidon raped Deme
ter Erinyes (the “angry Demeter”) during her search for her daughter
Persephone. Despite the Indo-European addition of the rape, Demeter con
tinued to be revered as “mother of the grain,” and “mother of the dead,”
since seeds must fall beneath the earth to grow again. Plutarch, in the first
century a .d . , called the dead “Demeter’s people,”Demetrioi.21 Such a belief
must have been in sharp contrast to the Indo-European view of the under
world as a gloomy and shadowy realm where bloodless souls reside.22
Homer speaks of “dread Persephone” as “Queen of the Dead,” married to
Hades. Yet, in visual art of the fifth and later centuries, Persephone sits
enthroned, holding a dove, a pomegranate, a torch, and/or ears of com.
Her torch light quickens the grain: the seed does not die, but continues
160 / The Greek Religion



to live in the underworld. This image epitomizes the essential difference
between Old European and Indo-European ideologies. In Old European
belief, life continues in a hibernating state (being in nonbeing), while in
Indo-European belief, life is diminished or extinguished. The Eleusinian
Mysteries prominently reflect Old European beliefs: the zoe, the “life force,”
suffers no interruption and permeates all things.
Demeter and Persephone are sometimes called Demetres, a name that
stresses the oneness of their divinity. In vase paintings and sculpture, it is
sometimes difficult to distinguish who is mother and who is daughter, so
similar do they appear, and so close is the bond between them. In fact,
the two images represent one goddess in two guises, her older and younger
aspects. In spring, the two are joyously reunited. Persephone returns to
the world of light with the child Brimos-Dionysus. The divine child is
birthed from the confrontation between darkness and light, and life
continues.
The story of Demeter and Persephone recalls much earlier Neolithic
depictions of the two goddesses, or the goddess portrayed as Siamese twins.
Sources as seemingly disparate as figurines dating from the seventh
through the fourth millennia b .c ., and Maltese temple layouts, preserve
both versions. In both double figurines (Fig. 76, above) and the Maltese
temples (Ggantija and Mnajdra, Figs. 73 and 74, above), the two elements
that comprise the image or structure are not equal: one is slightly larger
than the other. It is likely that the double images and temples symbolize
spring-summer and fall-winter seasons in a cycle of constant renewal.
Linos
Chapter 1, the discussion of the pregnant vegetation goddess and the
year god, investigated the importance of both male and female deities to
the perpetuation of the agricultural cycle. Not only did the Greeks adopt
the Old European vegetation goddess, they adopted the male rising and
dying vegetation deities as well. One such deity is Linos, the flax god, who
is bom from the earth, grows, blossoms, and later is tortured and dies.
Annual ceremonies lamented Linos’ “premature” death, described by sev
eral writers. Homer’s Iliad mentions the “Linos dirge” or “Linodia.”23 Hes
iod, in the middle of the seventh century b .c ., tells us that all singers and
lyre players recite the Linos song at banquets and dances.24 Other classi
cal authors repeatedly allude to the “Linos dirge” or “doom Linos.”
Dionysus
Another year god is the bull-born or water-bom homed Dionysus. He
appeared in spring brimming with virility and was most favored by women.
He thrives, marries the queen (the goddess), and finally dies. Many tern
161 / The Greek Religion



pies and sculptures evidence his cult. Festivals, such as the Anthesteria,
the Lenaia, and the Greater Dionysia, reenact an orgiastic scenario with
phalli, phallus-shaped cups, ladles, and cult dishes, and the bull-man
Dionysus marrying the queen. The Lenaia festival, held in January, woke
the slumbering vegetation. The City Dionysia festival in March acted to
ensure fertility, indicated by the presence of a phallus: one of the Greek
cities sent a phallus-shaped object as a tribute to this festival.25 The Anthes
teria was a festival of flowers, which included drinking and rejoicing.26 It
concluded with celebration of Dionysus’ marriage in an ox stall, attended
by women. Ritual artifacts similar to those from classical Greece— phalli,
cups with phallic handles, and bull-man sculptures— also surface in south
eastern Europe, dating from the sixth and fifth millennia b.c. They sug
gest that Dionysian-like festivals existed five thousand years before
classical Greek civilization, and that they endured for a very long time.
Other evidence for the longevity of the Dionysian cult comes from the
island of Keos, excavated by M. E. Caskey, who discovered a sanctuary of
Dionysus dating back to the fifteenth century b.c. This sanctuary had been
used for more than one thousand years. The Keos finds included terra
cotta figurines portraying women in a dancing posture, dressed in festive
attire, with exposed breasts, snake collars, and belts. They may represent
maenads, the devotees and ecstatic dancers in the Dionysian festivals.
According to Orphic religion, the god Dionysus was killed and dis
membered. He, like Persephone, receded into the dark depths of the earth
and remained there as a seed. Women saved the seed or phallus, laid it in
a winnowing fan, and performed the reawakening ritual of the god.27 In
the myth, Zeus entrusted the limbs of Dionysus to Apollo, who set them
beside his own tripod (the symbol recalling the feminine trinity) at Del
phi.28 The omphalos marked this holy place, the center of the Greek uni
verse. Apollo, the healer and bringer of light, eventually revitalizes the
dismembered, suffering, temporarily mad Dionysus. Each god needed the
other, for they represented the complementary aspects of darkness and
light. This reunification brought bliss to the earth.
Hermes
The pre-Olympian god Hermes, also associated with the phallus and
the snake, stimulated plant growth and animal fecundity. He was a likely
descendant of Old European phallic nude figures. A youthful god who
brought luck, he was particularly worshiped in Arcadia. His cult monu
ment is known as the phallus-herm, a square pillar crowned with a human
head and decorated with a phallus. A Greek traveler would commonly
see herms by the roadside. As an anthropomorphic deity, Hermes carried
a staff, the kerykeion, a magical wand with snakes twisted about it. He also
162 / The Greek Religion



ruled the underworld; with his kerykeion he summoned the souls from
the grave. Homer relates that he put men to sleep and also awakened them.
He was a psychopomp, and thus a regenerative god. The phallus and the
snake, his main symbols, are quite appropriate.
Asklepios
Another male deity associated with snakes is Greek Asklepios, the sav
ior-healer. A snake coils around his magic staff, as around Hermes’
kerykeion; in some representations he stands next to a snake, or a snake
crawls over his body. The function of Asklepios’ snake is healing, while
that of Hermes’ snakes is hibernating and awakening.
Zeus Ktesios
Snakes also guard the household and multiply wealth. The male
household snake in Greek mythology is Zeus Ktesios. Even here Zeus has
penetrated! As guardians of penus (food and provision) in Roman mythol
ogy, these male snakes, penates, are known from countless wall paintings.
Kronos
The pre-Hellenic god Kronos, often shown as an old man seated on a
chair holding a curved object, possibly a sickle, also guides the vegeta
tion cycle. His festival, Kronia, was a harvest celebration. Old European
sculptures and figurines of seated men holding a curved object likely depict
predecessors of Kronos. These images may originate in the pre-Greek Sesklo
(early sixth millennium b.c.) culture of Thessaly and the Tisza culture (early
fifth millennium b.c.), which flourished in the regions that became east
ern Hungary and Croatia.
Pan
The Greek god Pan clearly has pre-Hellenic roots. He was god of the
forest, who existed outside the pantheon of great gods and goddesses. He
was a shepherd, and he protected wild animals, hunters, and beekeepers.
His attributes included a syrinx (Pan’s pipes), a shepherd’s crook, and a
pine tree twig. More than one hundred recorded cult places identify with
Pan’s name, which demonstrates his popularity. His association with wild
nature suggests his deep roots in prehistory, perhaps even before the inven
tion of agriculture.
Conclusions
The above survey of Old European deities that influenced classical Greek
mythology illustrates that even after twenty-five hundred years of Indo
163 / The Greek Religion



European domination (from the early third millennium b .c . ) , Old Euro
pean religious concepts remained vital. The most important Old European
goddesses— who became Artemis, Hera, Athena, and Demeter— found
their way into the Olympic male pantheon. The Greeks built magnificent
temples for these goddesses, as they did for the Indo-European gods. How
ever, the independent, parthenogenetic (creating life without male par
ticipation) goddesses gradually became the brides, wives, and daughters
of the Indo-European gods, albeit not always successfully or consensu
ally. In Greek mythology, Zeus rapes hundreds of goddesses and nymphs,
Poseidon rapes Demeter, and Hades rapes Persephone. These rapes in the
divine sphere may have reflected the brutal treatment of Old European
mortal women during the transition from prepatriarchy to patriarchy.
Earlier, during Neolithic millennia, goddesses controlled birth giving,
life sustenance, death bringing, and regeneration. The Old European god
desses carried out these functions powerfully, as reflected by their phys
ically strong portrayals in figurine and sculptural art. By classical times,
the Old European goddesses were eroticized, militarized to various
degrees (especially Athena), and made subservient to the gods. Aphrodite
(Roman Venus) loses all functions but love and sexuality.29 This new fem
inine image diminished the physical power present in Old European god
desses, replacing it with frail beauty and physical weakness. This notion
of female deficiency, present in both religion and society, would be inher
ited by modem western cultures. It continues to plague secular and reli
gious art up to our times.
Some fusions of old and new male deities took place: Zeus and the
divine child, or Zeus and the snake (Zeus Ktesios). These fusions are strange
since Zeus represents a powerful, autonomous Indo-European thunder
god (or thunder god fused with the god of the shining sky). His entry into
the mythological realm of the divine child (bom in a cave and cared for
by the goddess) and the chthonic household divinity (the snake) is quite
incredible. Other Old European male deities— the fertility and vegetation
spirits, as well as the protectors of wild animals and forests— persisted
into Greek times almost unaltered.
164 / The Greek Religion



CHAPTER NINE
The Etruscan Religion
Another ancient culture that retained Old European-Anatolian tradi
tions is the Etruscan. The Etruscans inhabited a region of Italy north
of Rome in an area roughly corresponding to modem-day Tuscany known
in Roman times as Etruria. The Etruscans possessed the earliest civiliza
tion on the Italian peninsula, predating the Romans and contemporary to
the Greeks. During the height of their power in the eighth through the
sixth centuries b.c., the Etruscans ruled Rome, traded widely in the west
ern Mediterranean, and established colonies in southern Italy.
The origin of the Etruscans is somewhat enigmatic. During the past
century, scholarly debate has focused on whether the Etruscans originated
in Italy or emigrated from Asia Minor. Herodotus states that the Etruscans
emigrated from Lydia in Asia Minor in the thirteenth century b . c . One
artifact from the island of Lemnos in the northern Aegean Sea, a stela
engraved in a dialect related to the Etmscan language, lends weight to
this argument. However, the Etruscans could have evolved from the local
Iron Age culture known as the Villanovan.
Etruscan Language and Culture
The Etruscans spoke a non-Indo-European language, even though Indo
European speakers surrounded them on the Italian peninsula. Their Indo
European neighbors included the Latins (later Romans) and the Umbrians.
When the Greeks began to colonize portions of the western Mediterranean,1
their trade extended into the Tyrrhenian Sea west of central Italy and
brought them into contact with the Etruscans; Greek pottery is found in
Etmscan excavations of this time. The Etmscans adopted a number of
Greek innovations, including the Greek alphabet, which the Etmscans
modified slightly to write their own language.
165



Some thirteen thousand Etruscan inscriptions have been recorded, and
because we know the phonetic sounds of the Greek alphabet we can recon
struct roughly what the Etruscan language sounded like. The Etruscan
language has been deciphered, but most Etruscan texts remain obscure.
This is partly because Etruscan bears little relation to other known lan
guages and partly because most of the many inscriptions are short dedi
cations on tombs, mirrors, or pottery.2 Extensive texts are rare. The longest
inscription is a liturgical calendar of sacrifices and prayers from a sacred
book written on linen, parts of which were preserved because they were
recycled as wrappings for Egyptian mummies. A Croatian traveler in the
last century bought the linen, and it now resides in the Zagreb National
Museum. It contains some twelve hundred readable words. Ancient lan
guages are often bilingual: they are translated through inscriptions that
contain the same message in two languages: one of them already deci
phered, the other unknown. But only one bilingual (more exactly, close
to bilingual) inscription is known, written in Etruscan and Phoenician.
This inscription is written on three gold tablets found at Pyrgi in 1964,
at the Greek harbor of Caere, dating from about 500 b.c. The tablets, which
will be detailed later, include only an inscription to the goddess Uni, not
enough to solve the enigma of the Etruscan language.
The Etruscans differed socially from surrounding Indo-European cul
tures. Both Greeks and Romans noted the elevated position of women in
Etruscan society. Women drank, danced, attended the theater, and par
ticipated in public life. Etruscan women were literate. One of the better
known Etruscan women was Tanaquil, wife of Tarquinius Priscus, the first
Etruscan king of Rome. The Roman writer Livy recorded that she was
learned and well versed in the practices of divination.3 The Etruscans con
structed some of their most elaborate tombs for rich noblewomen or priest
esses. One example is the Regolini-Galassi tomb at Caere, which dates
from the seventh century b.c., richly equipped with gold jewelry, ivory
pyxis, silver table service, and dice. Artifacts from this tomb can now be
found in the Vatican’s Museo Gregoriano.
While the existing Greek and Roman literary evidence gives us some
idea of Etruscan social life, we know little of Etruscan religion, for several
reasons. First, a distinct Etruscan society had died out by the time Rome
reached its glory, so later cultures did not preserve its traditions. Second,
no extensive Etruscan written religious records have survived. Conse
quently, we have no literary evidence for Etruscan mythology compara
ble to that of the Greeks and Romans. We do know that, in addition to
their own pantheon of deities, the Etruscans adopted Greek goddesses,
gods, and myths. Inscriptions mention a number of Etruscan deities, some
of which carry Etruscan names; others come from Greek or Latin. Much
166 / The Etruscan Religion



of our knowledge comes from secondhand accounts by the Greeks and
Romans, and from archaeological evidence of the later Etruscan period
(the fifth to the second centuries b.c.). Despite these obstacles, something
can be learned about Etruscan religion and its Old European inheritance.
Temples
The existence of altars, sculptures, temples, temple models, and hundreds
of votive offerings speaks clearly of continuity with the Old European
Anatolian tradition. This continuity especially occurs in the Etruscan sacred
architecture. Etruscan temples typically accommodate a triple-cella (triple
alcove) reminiscent of Maltese temple triple-cellas (as in Ggantija) and
Minoan triple-cella mountain peak sanctuaries. Moreover, the Etruscans,
not the Indo-Europeans, originated the cult image in Italy. In fact, prior
to Etruscan influence, the Romans did not make images of their deities.
The earliest wood and terra-cotta sculptures have succumbed to time, but
smaller votive figures— reduced copies of cult statues— survive in con
siderable numbers. The Etruscans formed divine triads, an inheritance from
the Old European triple goddesses and the general sacredness of the num
ber three. Outside Veil stood a Portonaccio temple dedicated to three god
desses: Minerva, Aritimi, and Turan.4 The Etruscan Tarquín kings built
and dedicated the Capitoline temple in Rome to the triad formed by Tinia,
Uni, and Menerva (Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva). Later, after the Etruscans
had been driven from Rome, the Capitoline temple became the religious
center of the whole Roman world. According to tradition, every Etruscan
city must include a tripartite temple. A new Etruscan city could not be
established without three sanctuaries and three gates.
Goddesses, Gods, and Spirits
The Etruscan pantheon of deities is related to that of the Greeks in that
both comprise Old European and Indo-European gods and goddesses. The
way in which the two pantheons were formed is, however, different. Ear
lier in this chapter, I examined how classical Greek culture and religion
emerged from the forcible conquest of Greece and the Aegean Islands by
Indo-Europeanized tribes. By contrast, the Indo-European deities pres
ent in the Etruscan pantheon evolved through peaceful influences, as a
result of trading contacts with the Greeks.
Inscriptions on various artifacts, as well as historical sources, provide
the names and some information about Etruscan deities.5 References by
Roman historians dating from the fifth and fourth centuries B.c. indicate
some of the major goddesses of a number of Etruscan cities. For instance,
167 / The Etruscan Religion



Juno Regina was the great-goddess of Veii, while Juno Curitis was the chief
deity of the Etruscan Falerii.6 Greek authors mention that the Etruscans
worshiped the goddess in the great sanctuary at Pyrgi, on the coast near
Cerveteri (Caere); they gave her the Greek names Eileithyia, a childbirth
goddess, and Leucothea, a sea goddess.7We know from bilingual inscrip
tions that Juno is the Latin name for the Etruscan goddess Uni. (In Greece
she is known as Hera.) Eileithyia and Leucothea perhaps became aspects
of the life-giving functions of the goddess Uni. Bilingual gold tablets from
Pyrgi, dating from circa 500 b .c . and inscribed in Etruscan and Phoeni
cian, record a text of gratitude from the ruler of Cisra (Caere) to the god
dess Uni, identified as Semitic Ashtarte (Strt) in Phoenician. Although
inscriptions say nothing about her functions, the various sources seem to
agree that Uni was the most revered goddess, like the great-goddess of
the Minoans. Depictions of this goddess in Thera and Crete frequently
show her flanked by dogs, lions, or griffins. Early Etruscan art, from the
period around 700 b .c ., echoes the Minoan portrayal, picturing Uni
between two winged sphinxes (as on, for instance, the ivory pyxis from
Cerveteri, now in the Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore).
Significant religious artifacts include Etruscan mirrors, produced from
530 through 200 b .c . and inscribed with names of deities and Greek mytho
logical figures.8 One favored divinity on these mirrors is Menerva or Men
rva (Roman Minerva), adopted from the Greek Athena along with her
militarized features. Portrayals of Menerva from the fifth century b .c . show
her winged, with the head of a Medusa, in the company of Hercle (Her
akles), Turms (Hermes), or Pherse (Perseus). On mirrors dating to around
300 b .c ., she appears engraved in full regalia: crested, flowing-maned hel
met, with Gorgon-headed aegis and spear. Other goddesses identified on
mirrors include Aritimi or Artumes (Artemis) and Turan, goddess of love,
known in Latin as Venus and in Greek as Aphrodite. Etruscan mirror
inscriptions also mention male deities; among them are Fufluns, who cor
related with Greek Dionysus and Roman Bacchus. A bronze mirror from
Chiusi, dating to the late fourth century b .c ., reveals a young Fufluns with
his partner, Areatha (Ariadne), flanked by Fufluns’ mother, Semla (Semele),
and a satyr named Sime, “snub-nosed.”
A bronze model of a sheep’s liver may constitute the most unusual arti
fact inscribed with names of divinities. The model dates from approxi
mately 150 b .c . and came to light near Piacenza in the Po Valley in 1877.
This rare find provides evidence for Etruscan divination, a practice that
made the Etruscans famous in the ancient world, and that, after the Romans
conquered them, they were still called upon to perform. One of the prac
tices of divination was haruspicy (or hepatoscopy), in which an animal (usu
ally a sheep) was sacrificed and its internal organs, particularly the liver,
168 / The Etruscan Religion



were examined. The Etruscans must have viewed the liver as a microcosm
of the universe. On the bronze model from the Po Valley, the outer mar
gin contains sixteen regions, corresponding to sections of the sky, and the
interior is divided into twenty-four regions. The deity names inscribed on
the liver, known mostly from earlier sources, are Uni, Tin (Tinia), Fufluns,
Hercle, Selvan (Silvanus), Cel (a mother goddess), Celsclan (son of Cel),
Catha (a sun god), Usil (the sun), and Tivr (the moon).
From the inscriptions and portrayals of goddesses and gods, it appears
that an overwhelming number of Etruscan divinities stem from Old Euro
pean deities. Notwithstanding their Indo-Europeanization via Greek and
local Italic influences, they retained an almost complete Old European
tradition. Among the female deities are Uni, most likely the life giver and
regenerator; Aritimi (Artemis), the nature goddess, who may have been
the same as Uni; Menerva (Roman Minerva; Greek Athena), a militarized
Old European bird goddess; Turan (Roman Venus; Greek Aphrodite) ,9 god
dess of love; Semla (Greek Semele), earth goddess;10 Cel, the mother god
dess (who could have been a mother aspect of Uni or related to Semla).
Among the males were Fufluns (Dionysus); Turms (Hermes); Selvan (Sil
vanus), protector of forests; and the divine child. Regarding the latter, it
seems that Etruria developed the divine child image along the lines of the
Cretan Zeus. On an Archaic scarab from Etruria, a winged goddess car
ries a young male figure; the inscription identifies them as Turan and Tinia
(Tinia was the equivalent of Zeus). Here, as in Crete, the major Indo
European god was converted into a child.
The magnificent Etruscan tombs also preserve the Old European con
cepts of life, death, and regeneration, especially during their earlier
period.11 Death goddess images that have Old European roots continue
throughout the whole of Etruscan history. Etruscan statues of nude god
desses, standing erect with feet together (such as that found at Orvieto,
dating from the sixth century b .c .), may derive from the Neolithic stiff
nudes. As late as the fourth century b .c ., a vulture deity— who may be
related to the Neolithic vulture goddess, albeit in male form— appeared
as a death demon in Etruscan tomb paintings. In the tomb of Orcus at
Tarquinia, a painted scene illustrates a fearsome winged monster with a
vulture’s beak, an ass’ ears, and snake-infested hair, hovering above a seated
Theseus. Written beside the monster is his name: Tuchulcha. Another
winged demon portrayed with the hooked nose of a vulture and snake
hair and armed with a hammer is Charun. He is related to the Greek
Charon, the ferryman of the dead. Winged Vanths— young, fair women
wearing short skirts, crossed baldrics, and hunter’s boots— assist Charun
in his shepherding of the dead. Like the Germanic Valkyries, the Vanths
linger at battles and accompany the dead to the underworld. Some min
169 / The Etruscan Religion



gling with Indo-European elements occurs on Etruscan tombs later, in the
fourth and third centuries b .c ., when Rome ruled the Etruscan cities. But
early tumuli clearly reflect Old European concepts.
Although the frightening demon is present in the Etruscan tombs, there
is nothing mournful or sinister in tomb paintings. Most Etruscan death
shrines celebrate life and regeneration, depicting joyful scenes of nature,
featuring ducks, playful dolphins, trees of life, bulls, erotic scenes, and
banquets with drinking, music, and dancing. Consider one painting from
the Tomb of the Lionesses: the side walls illustrate a banquet. Above, on
a frieze, flying ducks and dolphins plunge into a ruffled sea; young men
lie stretched out, their long hair wreathed with green leaves. One man
holds an egg in his right hand, obviously a symbol of regeneration. The
end wall of the tomb shows a gigantic crater wreathed with vine leaves.
On either side stand the musicians: a piper and a citharist. To the left, a
woman dances, her red-lined blue cloak swinging with her movement.
To the right, a boy and girl dance opposite each other; the girl makes the
gesture of the horns with her left arm while the boy swings a jug. Other
tombs show funereal games with wrestlers, boxers, gladiatorial combat,
and horse and chariot races. Feasts with music and dancing, and pre
sumably with games and races, very likely originate in the funereal rites
of Neolithic Europe. Remnants of feasts, drums, and dancing scenes on
vases imply a joyful celebration of the deceased’s reunion with the ances
tors. Etruscan tombs preserved the final chapter in the Old European phi
losophy of life and death, in which they viewed death as ajoyful transition
necessary for the renewal of life.
Decline of the Etruscans
Toward the end of the sixth century b .c ., the fortunes of the Etruscans
declined. First, in 509 b .c . the Romans expelled the Etruscan Tarquín kings
from Rome. Several decades later, in 4 7 4 b .c ., a fleet from the Greek city
of Syracuse in Sicily decisively defeated the Etruscan fleet off Cumae in
southern Italy. Subsequently, the colonies in southern Italy slipped from
Etruscan control. Shortly thereafter, the Romans began their expansion
northward, and the closest Etruscan city to Rome— Veil— fell in 396 b .c .
In the first few decades of the fourth century, disaster also visited the Etrus
cans from another direction: Celtic tribes from the Alpine region infiltrated
the northern Italic peninsula and reduced the once-powerful Etruscan city
states. Over the next century and a half, the Romans conquered all Etrus
can cities, and Etruria remained within the Roman sphere for the duration
of the Roman Empire.
The Roman conquerors adopted several significant features from the
170 / The Etruscan Religion



Etruscans, such as the Greek alphabet, which they used for writing Latin.
The Romans also inherited a number of architectural innovations: the basic
temple plan, the Etruscan-style Doric column, and the practice of design
ing towns along a north-south grid. Etruscans even influenced Roman
dress: the famous Roman toga was borrowed from the Etruscans. In reli
gion, the Etruscans inspired the Roman art of divination.12 The Etruscan
language, though not in daily use after the beginning of the Christian era,
may have survived in certain Roman rituals until the end of the fourth
century A.D.13
Conclusions
The Etruscans were an ancient Italic people who were surrounded by Indo
European speakers and yet spoke a non-Indo-European language and pre
served a non-Indo-European culture.14 Etruscan women, unlike most
classical Greek and Roman women, participated in public life, were lit
erate, and were often buried in elaborate tombs, which may reflect high
status.
Etruscan deities were an amalgam of Indo-European and non-Indo
European; many deities, such as Uni (RomanJuno), Menerva (Roman Min
erva), Tinia (Roman Jupiter), and Aritimi (Greek Artemis; Roman Diana)
have much in common with their classical counterparts. But the conti
nuity with Old European-Anatolian culture is evidenced by Etruscan altars,
sculptures, and temples built with triple alcoves similar to those in tem
ples in Malta and Crete.
Etruscan tombs seem to reflect the Old European concept of regener
ation, depicting joyful scenes taken from nature; scenes of music, dancing,
and lovemaking; and trees of life. The Etruscans produced art evocative
of Old Europe. Menerva was portrayed with wings, while Uni was flanked
by winged sphinxes: both continued the iconography of the Neolithic bird
goddess. Thus, the Etruscans preserved an island of Old Europe within
an Indo-European sphere.

CHAP T E R TEN
The Basque Religion
I
n western Europe, several cultural islands continued Old European tra
ditions throughout the millennia: the Basques in the western Pyrenees
(now northern Spain and southwestern France), the Iberians of eastern
and southeastern Spain, and the Piets in the Scottish Highlands. This chap
ter will focus on the Basques, whose non-Indo-European language, social
structure, and, to some extent, ancient religion have been preserved to
this day.
Basque Language and Culture
The Basque language is a pre-Indo-European relic of the ancient western
European languages. It is the only indigenous language to survive the Indo
European invasions and cultural influences of the last three thousand years.
The Basque people themselves have retained a remarkable ability to inte
grate new influences without losing their cultural identity. Indeed, they
remain the great exception to all the laws of European political and cul
tural history. There is no doubt that the Basques are living Old Europeans
whose traditions descend directly from Neolithic times. Many aspects of
Old European culture— goddess religion, the lunar calendar, matrilineal
inheritance laws, and agricultural work performed by women— continued
in Basque country until the early twentieth century. For more than a cen
tury, scholars have widely discussed the high status of Basque women in
law codes, as well as their positions as judges, inheritors, and arbitrators
through pre-Roman, medieval, and modem times.1 The system of laws
governing succession in the French Basque region reflected total equality
between the sexes. Up until the eve of the French Revolution, the Basque
woman was truly “the mistress of the house,” hereditary guardian, and
head of the lineage.
172



The Basque Goddess and Her Offspring
Christianity arrived late to Basque country. The populace was only super
ficially Christian in remote rural areas during the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries. Even in the twentieth century, some mountainous regions
escaped Christianity. There, belief in the goddess remains a living reality.
ANDRE MARI
The primary Basque goddess worshiped today is known as Mari, often
combined with Andre, “Lady.” She also preserves local names derived from
places where she appears, usually at caves: Lady of Anboto; Andre Mari
Munoko, “Lady Mari of Muno”; Txindokiko Mari, “the Mari of Chindo
qui”; and others. Her image and functions are known from living beliefs.
They are richly documented in collections of folklore (primarily the twenty
volumes by José Miguel de Barandiarân).
Andre Mari continues many characteristic features of the prehistoric
magician goddess of death and regeneration. She is the vulture goddess,
tomb goddess, and regenerator who appears in a multitude of zoomor
phic shapes, similar to those she manifested during the Neolithic. Basque
folklore recalls that she was also a prophetess who ruled over natural phe
nomena and guarded moral conduct. Although the Inquisition ruthlessly
persecuted devotees of the goddess as “witches,” the goddess somehow
escaped destruction here, as well as in northern Europe, where the
Basque Mari closely parallels the Germanic Holla and Baltic Ragana.
Basque mythology recognized the underworld as the realm of the god
dess. Rivers of milk and honey flow in this delightful region, where every
thing is abundant. The underworld communicates with the upper world
by means of apertures: wells, caves, and abysses. Souls of the dead emerge
occasionally through winding cave galleries and abysses. Devotees also
leave offerings to the dead and to the goddess at caves. Mari generally takes
on bird form in her subterranean abodes: she flies out of caves as a crow
or a vulture. In the great cave of Supelegor in the mountain of Itzine
(Orozco), she appears as a vulture with her companions.
Legends revere Mari as a prophetess and oracle. Devotees sought her
advice at cave entrances, where she would appear if called three times.
Her caves shelter a fire and bread oven, since she bakes bread on Friday.
She appears at the entrance to the cave spinning thread with a bobbin of
gold, or combing her hair with a golden comb. In her cave at Anboto, she
makes skeins of golden thread using the horns of a ram as bobbins, and
elsewhere she combs her hair while mounted on a ram. Mari’s habitations
are richly adorned with gold and precious stones, but when robbers take
this wealth outside, it turns to coal or rotten wood. These legends
173 / The Basque Religion



bequeath the goddess with the power to control human greediness and
to magically transform substances, a power also possessed by the goblins,
her avatars, who can increase or decrease wealth.
Mari also upholds law codes. She is herself the lawgiver, ruling over
communal life and watching jealously to see that her commandments are
kept. She condemns lying, robbery, pride and bragging, the breaking of
a promise, and lack of respect for people, houses, and property. In this
capacity, she ensures a high standard of moral conduct.
Mari rules natural phenomena: hail, winds, drought, lightning, and
rainstorms. She creates storms or droughts to chastise disobedient or evil
people. She appears crossing the sky with a cart, as a woman who emits
flames, or as a woman enveloped in fire. She sometimes even drags a broom
or rides mounted on a ram. As an incarnation of lightning, she is frequently
seen as a sphere (or bundle) of fire, or as a sickle or stick of fire. Folklore
recounts that she throws storms down from the caves. Conjurations and
offerings can placate the goddess, and the Basques have even celebrated
Catholic masses and performed exorcisms near the mouths of certain caves.
If pleased, she protects her flock by keeping winds and storms locked up
in the underworld.
Mari is associated with the moon. To this day, people of Azcoitia province
view her as a great woman whose head is encircled by the full moon. This
belief provides a link between Mari and the Greek Artemis-Hekate, who
is also an incarnation of the moon. Basque folklore that elucidates Mari’s
power over celestial phenomena gives us information regarding this
important Old European goddess that archaeological sources could not
provide.
MARI’S OFFSPRING
Basque mythology has preserved mythological figures that have names
related to Mari and are associated with stones, tombs, and ancestors. These
are Mairi, Maide, and Maindi. The Main are builders of the dolmens, mega
lithic structures that consist of two upright stones and a capstone. The
male Maide are mountain spirits and builders of the cromlechs, the ancient
structures consisting of single stones encircling a mound. The Maindi are
souls of ancestors who visit their old hearths at night.
Still other relatives include the Laminak, which appear in human form
but with chicken, duck, goose, or goat feet (just as the goddess herself
appears with bird or goat legs). The elflike Laminak correlate with the
Baltic Laumas; both are extensions of the powers of the goddess. Laminak
are female counterparts of the cromlech-building Maide. They increase
and decrease wealth, assist industrious women, and control moral behav
ior and male sexuality. Their tomb-building activities in the area more than
174 / The Basque Religion



anything else speak for deep antiquity and link these creatures with the
West European Neolithic.
Conclusions
Like the Etruscans, the Basques were surrounded by Indo-European speak
ers, but they too retained their non-Indo-European language, culture, and
religion.2 Remarkably, the Basques have maintained their uniqueness into
the modem era.
Similarly to the Etruscans, the Basque women held important positions
in society, inheriting equally with Basque males. The major Basque deity
was Mari, a goddess who appeared in the form of a vulture or crow: a
goddess of death and regeneration, a prophetess, a lawgiver, and mistress
of natural phenomena. Her realm was the underworld, a region of abun
dance rather than terror. Mari liked to spin and bake. She thus incorpo
rated many of the attributes of the Old European goddess. Her offspring,
the builders of megaliths and cromlechs, also connect her to Old Europe.

CHAPTER ELEVEN
The Celtic Religion
Religious Continuity in Central and Northern Europe
From about 3000 b .c . until the end of the first millennium b .c ., much of
central Europe was a hybrid of Indo-European and Old European cul
ture. The Indo-European influence can be seen in the importance placed
on combat and the production of weapons. In many regions, burial rites
carried on the Indo-European tradition, which featured a single male war
rior interred with his weapons. The horse played an important role in soci
ety, being a sign of wealth and mobility. Indo-Europeanized society was
stratified, with the king and warrior-nobility at the top and farmers and
other nurturers forming the lowest stratum. The Indo-Europeans depended
heavily on metals for trade and for their own weapons and tools. Through
out their history, the smiths were renowned for their metallurgy, and the
craft of shaping metal would take on mystical proportions. Yet the art of
later Bronze Age cultures and the early Iron Age Hallstatt culture in cen
tral Europe (sixth century b .c .) revealed an imagery that could only have
been inherited from Old Europe. The degree of Indo-Europeanization var
ied markedly in different geographical regions.
Although the Kurgan element is widespread in central Europe, the Old
Europeans also left their mark on the central European funerary monu
ments. Figurines incised with symbols of regeneration appear in graves
down to the middle of the second millennium b .c . Urns and accompa
nying vases are also richly decorated with Old European symbols. There
is a strong presence of owl and duck imagery. Bird-shaped vases and bird
figurines continued to be produced with exceptional skill. Images with
other divine animals, especially pigs, boars, deer, and snakes, comprise
the rest of the funerary repertoire.
There still existed a farming culture along the Danube Valley west and
176



east of present-day Belgrade throughout the first half of the second mil
lennium b .c ., an “island” of Old European culture almost devoid of Indo
European elements. This remarkable repository of Old European traditions
extended from the Tisza and Mure§ (Maros) basin in the west, along the
Danubian valley, and across the provinces of Banat and Oltenia. (The names
of the culture groups used in archaeological literature are Periam, Pecica,
Verbicioara, Vattina/Gîrla-Mare, Q m a.) Their permanent agricultural set
tlements formed tells as in the Neolithic, and there are no Kurgan (round
barrow) graves in this area. The burial cemeteries of the early second mil
lennium b .c . and cremation cemeteries of the mid-second millennium b .c .
yielded elegant and delicate vases, thin-walled, well-baked and burnished,
incised and white-encrusted with Old European symbols: snake coils, spi
rals, hooks, horns, Y s, M’s, X’s, zigzags, bi-lines, tri-lines, snake spirals,
combs, and others. In about thirty cemeteries that harbored cremation
urns, excavators found terra-cotta statuettes placed inside the urn or on
its shoulder. The figurines continue the Old European tradition, repre
senting the goddess of death and regeneration. They have small abstracted
heads, but some are clearly bird-beaked and have round owl eyes. The
statuettes are portrayed in a standing position with arms folded above the
waistline. The upper body is flat, and the lower part is bell-shaped, sug
gesting a flounced skirt. Incised designs suggest diadems and strings of
necklaces, many with attached semicircular pendants (replicas of gold pen
dants were widespread during the mid-second millennium b .c . in east
central Europe).
Other symbols dominant on grave goods include concentric circles, alter
nating spirals, and snake coils, as well as double and triple snake coils,
rows of hatched triangles or triple triangles, vertically flowing zigzag
bands, and combs. Some of these symbols recall those from western Euro
pean funerary monuments such as Newgrange (particularly the triple-snake
coil motif). They also are similar to symbols incised on schist figurines from
Portuguese megalithic passage graves, which included rows of hatched tri
angles. Snake coils forming the limbs of the goddess frequently decorate
sarcophagi of postpalatial Crete.
From Dupljaja, northeast of Belgrade, which belongs to and dates from
the same culture that created the cremation urn cemeteries, come terra
cotta wheeled carts drawn by ducks, with a goddess standing on the plat
form. She has a beaked head, a flounced skirt (as on other figurines), and
double-spiral ornaments. Concentric circles and rows of hatched trian
gles decorate her skirt. Another cart holds a standing deity with incised
circles and concentric circles flanked with swastikas. The cart carrying the
deity, drawn by waterbirds, reflects a belief in a goddess who accompa
nied the dead to the afterworld beyond the waters. Many graves contained
177 / The Celtic Religion



duck-shaped vases standing near the urns, together with the figurines. In
a Korbovo cremation cemetery (comprising the eastern group of this cul
ture), one grave held five vessels filled with bones of a fowl. The impor
tant role of the waterbird and the regenerating functions of the deity cannot
be doubted. Model carts carrying female deities brought their significance
into the succeeding centuries of the central European Hallstatt. That the
Dupljaja deity represents the sun god Apollo, as Belgrade archaeologists
assume, is doubtful. An outstanding four-wheeled bronze funerary cart, thirty-five cen
timeters long, was discovered in 1851 at Strettweg in eastern Austria, in
a Hallstatt mound cremation grave with stone construction. It dates from
the seventh century b .c . This impressive bronze work portrays the god
dess standing in the center, twice the size of the other figures around her.
She holds a gigantic dish in her upraised arms, perhaps a container of
regenerating life-water, or water in which the goddess herself was cleansed
in order to be reborn. Stags with huge antlers stand at the front and back
of the cart, surrounded by naked men and women. There are two pairs
of shielded horsemen and an ithyphallic man holding an upraised ax. The
front and rear of the wagon platform displayed pairs of horse heads. The
Strettweg cart reflects a spring regenerative ritual akin to that of the
Germanic goddess Nerthus, described by Tacitus, in which the goddess
was carried in a cart through her land.1
These few examples show that the goddess, in the aspects of death and
regeneration, continued to be worshiped throughout the two millennia
before the Christian era. Her owl, duck, and snake guises were popular.
The cart-riding motif is an innovation, but the association of the goddess
with basins, cleansing, and renewal originated with the life-bringing
Neolithic goddess. Another aspect of the goddess, extremely popular in
early Iron Age iconography, and descended from the Neolithic, is the “mis
tress of animals”: the winged queen holding rabbits or geese, flanked by
lions, and associated with snakes and birds of prey. Around 600 b .c ., this
image was widespread throughout the Mediterranean regions of Greece,
Etruria, France, and even north of the Alps.
The Celts
The Celts constitute one of the interesting Indo-European-speaking cul
tures that formed from the meeting of Indo-European and Old European
cultures during the Bronze Age. According to archaeological evidence, the
Celtic tribes migrated south and west from their central European home
land in the eleventh to tenth centuries b .c ., settling across modern-day
France and the Iberian Peninsula. In the ninth and eighth centuries, they
178 / The Celtic Religion



moved throughout Europe, mostly westward. They came to prominence
during the eighth and seventh centuries b .c ., and by the fourth to third
centuries b .c ., the Celts had covered much of Europe. Consequently, they
significantly influenced the development of subsequent European culture,
contributing an advanced knowledge of metalworking and a significant
body of ancient oral literature.
Records of Celtic presence in the British islands and in Ireland date
from the sixth to fifth centuries b .c . Ample archaeological evidence in buri
als and metalwork confirms that by the fourth to third centuries b .c ., the
Celtic confederation had extended from the British Isles to the Alps. In
the early fourth century b .c ., several Celtic tribes from central Europe over
ran the Italic peninsula, contributing to the weakening of the Etruscan
city-states. A Celtic group sacked Rome in 387 b .c . By 225 b .c ., the Roman
military machine had finally defeated the Celts and had driven them out
of the Italic peninsula. The Celts also expanded into southern Europe,
impinging on the Greeks and pillaging the holy Greek sanctuary of Del
phi in 279 b .c . Several tribes migrated into the Balkan Peninsula, even
tually crossing to Asia Minor, where they settled and became known to
later history as the Galatians. During the first century b .c ., the fortune of
the Celts changed. Julius Caesar conquered the Celtic tribes in Gaul (mod
ern-day France), and Germanic tribes invaded much of the remaining Celtic
territory in central and eastern Europe.
In the early stages of Celtic culture formation, Old European influence
can be seen in the relatively high status of Celtic women.2 Rich burials of
women mark the Hallstatt period, particularly the burial of a Celtic woman
near Vix in east-central France, dated to around 525 b .c . Like Celtic noble
men, the woman— perhaps a princess— was buried with a funerary wagon,
surrounded byjewelry, Greek and Etruscan pottery, silver bowls, and bronze
basins. One of the most spectacular items found in a Hallstatt grave was a
giant krater, or mixing bowl, used for funereal feasting. The huge vessel is
more than 1.5 meters high and almost 4 meters in circumference, with a
capacity of about 1,250 liters.
Later, in the historical era, Irish women upheld their prominent posi
tions. When an Irish woman married, she retained ownership of her own
property, which she took with her if the bond dissolved. Ancient writers
noted the willingness and zeal with which Celtic women fought alone or
alongside their husbands in battle.
OLD EUROPEAN DEITIES DURING THE PERIOD OF CELTIC
D O M IN A N C E IN C E N T R A L E U R O P E AND ROMAN TIM ES
Some remarkable pieces of art, undoubtedly related to Celtic religion, date
from when the Celts pressed into eastern Europe. One celebrated find is
179 / The Celtic Religion



the silver Gundestrup cauldron, dated to somewhat before 100 b .c . Acci
dentally discovered in 1891 in a peat bog near Gundestrup, northern Jut
land (Denmark), it encompasses motifs influenced by art from many
different regions: Celtic, Thracian, and Hellenistic. Consequently, it was
probably produced in an area central to all these regions, most probably
northwestern Bulgaria and adjoining southern Romania, the homeland of
the Thracian tribe, the Triballoi. This tribe was influenced by the Celtic
Scordisci tribe, which settled along the banks of the Danube. In this region,
a mixed Celtic-Thracian society thrived. The Gundestrup cauldron reflects
both Celtic and Thracian artistic styles and mythological figures. Art his
torians have documented the technique and the material— fine hammered
silver work with human and animal figures beaten into high repousse
from the Thracian and Dacian area, but not from Celtic western Europe.
Even the details of dress on the Gundestrup cauldron have exact paral
lels on an important silver artifact from southeast Europe: a gilded phalera
(a metal disk worn as a sign of military rank), found in a grave at Stara
Zagora in central Bulgaria, also dating from the first century b .c . On this
phalera, the costume of Hercules corresponds exactly with that of a male
figure, claimed to be Cemunnos, on the cauldron: tight-fitting trousers,
linearly striped, which stop just above the knee. (To learn more about the
origin and interpretation of mythological elements, see Kaul et al. 1991.)
Several other stylistic features of the Gundestrup cauldron confirm its place
of origin on the border between the Celtic Scordisci and the Thracian Trib
allians. The Germanic Cimbri raided this territory in 118 b .c . and sent
the cauldron to Denmark, probably as war booty, and then their coun
terparts set it into a peat bog, possibly as a religious offering. Iron Age
tribes commonly offered valuable weapons and art works to deities by
throwing them into rivers or placing them in peat bogs.3
Several plates, ornamented in relief, comprise the cauldron itself. Each
of the seven outer plates portrays an anthropomorphic figure in half-length
portrait, without doubt representing a deity. Four depict bearded men who
have upraised arms and clenched fists. Three illustrate women. One outer
plate is missing, and it too probably depicted a woman. The female fig
ures have long hair, which falls down against the shoulders to both sides.
Two of the female figures hold their hands on their chests, below their
breasts; the third raises her right arm, upon which sits a small bird. Two
servants or priestesses, depicted in a smaller size, attend this latter figure:
one sits on her right shoulder, while the other arranges her hair. Eagles
(or other birds of prey) fly near each side of her head. A pair of anthro
pomorphic male figures flanks one of the females. All of the females and
two of the males wear torques (neck rings), a typical Celtic ornament
regarded by the Celts as having magical properties in warding off evil. Two
180 / The Celtic Religion



of the five inner plates portray similar males and females surrounded by
wild beasts. The female is flanked by jumping griffins, rosette-shaped
wheels, and elephants (Indian elephants were used in the armies of the
Hellenistic rulers). The third inner plate portrays the stag god Cemunnos
with large antlers. He sits on the ground, legs drawn up, clothed in a tight
fitting pant costume, wearing a torque around his neck, holding a torque
in his right hand and a large ram-headed snake in his left. A stag stands
to his left and a wolf to his right. The fourth inner plate depicts three bulls,
each with a man in front holding a sword (the three bulls are to be sacri
ficed). The fifth inner plate, the richest in figures, shows a troop of horse
men and a row of marching warriors holding a long tree with the tips of
their swords, and a scene of human sacrifice.4 The base plate from the
interior of the cauldron discloses a large prostrate bull and ajumping priest
ess with spurs on her feet above it, about to plunge a slashing sword
(machaira) into the neck of the beast; this scene thus depicts a bull sacrifice.
The portrayals of female and male figures— again, perhaps deities
on this cauldron reveal a syncretistic religion with elements inherited from
both Old European and Indo-European religions. Except for the stag god
Cemunnos (portrayed on the inner plate and also in one of the portraits
holding stags aloft), the male deities are Indo-European, probably Celtic
Taranis (or Thracian Perkunas), the thunder god; and Ares or Esus, god
of war and fertility. The female portraits are in no way Indo-European.
They represent the familiar Old European goddess in several of her aspects.
On one panel, she is the life bringer in spring, surrounded by wild beasts;
on another, she is the goddess of death and regeneration, associated with
birds of prey.
Nanny de Vries (in Kaul et al. 1991) identifies one Gundestmp god
dess with the Phrygian goddess Kybele, who was also very popular in
Thrace. There Kybele fused with the local goddess Rhea-Bendis. In Greek
literary sources, Kybele is referred to as “great-goddess,” “mother of the
gods,” “mountain mother,”and “queen of the wild beasts.”The taurobolium,
or bull sacrifice, represents the most important ritual honoring this god
dess. The day of the sacrifice was considered to be the day of rebirth. The
bull’s male organs were offered as a dedication to her. In Thracian art from
the fourth to the first centuries b.c., Kybele appears as a winged figure
holding lions or riding a lion. On a silver jug from the treasure of
Rogozen, Bulgaria, she sits enthroned, flanked by two lions or centaurs.
On the Rogozen jug, she is “queen of the wild beasts,” holding dogs (like
the Greek Artemis); on the Gundestmp cauldron, she is surrounded by a
number of wild animals and flanked by elephants. Both portrayals are asso
ciated with the bull sacrifice.
The antlered god Cemunnos also embodies regenerative symbolism.
181 / The Celtic Religion



The figure sitting on the ground in cross-legged position with closed eyes
and open mouth appears to be singing. The antlers and serpent he holds
in one hand symbolize rebirth. The torque around his neck characterizes
him as divine. This iconography is Celtic, but the tale itself, as Best argues
(Kaul et al. 1991), may be that of the divine Thracian singer Orpheus,
whose voice enchants animals of prey as well as other beings animate and
inanimate. The stag god depicts the Thracian version of the Old European mas
ter of animals or “lord of wild things.” He is also carved in rock at Val
Camonica, in the Alps of northern Italy. Scholars have dated the engrav
ing to the fourth century b .c ., the era when the Celts occupied this area.
A number of stelae reliefs of the homed god associated with a stag and
bull or with a ram-headed serpent are known from Roman Gaul. The name
“Cemunnos” appears in a relief carving from Paris, above a representation
of an antlered god (although the god could have had other names else
where). Some of the Gaulish portrayals associate the homed god with mate
rial prosperity. A stela relief found at Reims portrays the god seated
Buddha-like near a stag and a bull. He holds a sack from which cascades
a stream of coins. The Celts in Britain and Ireland preserved this god as
keeper of the forest and the animals. The medieval Welsh “Four Branches”
(Tales) of the Mabinogi contains the tale of Owain, which includes a vignette
of a huge dark man sitting on a mound; as keeper of the forest, he can
summon all animals through the bellowing of a stag. The tale narrates that
they do obeisance to him “as humble subjects would do to their lord.”
After the Romans conquered Gaul, they wrote descriptions of the Celts
and their religion. These Roman writers (including Caesar himself), how
ever, describe them from a Roman perspective using Roman appellations.
In Gallic Wars, Caesar lists the principal deities of the Gauls.5 Mercury,
who possesses the most images, invented all the arts, guided travelers,
and encouraged commerce. After Mercury, Caesar continues, the Celts hon
ored Apollo, Mars, Jupiter, and Minerva. Apollo drives away diseases, Mars
controls the issues of war, and Jupiter rules the heavens. Mars and Jupiter
are Indo-European gods, but Apollo may have been fused with a local
youthful healing god. In Caesar’s description, Minerva teaches the first
principles of the arts and crafts; dedications to Minerva are found in Gaul
and in Britain.
The Romans mention many sanctuaries at the sources of Gallic rivers:
for instance, a sanctuary dedicated to Dea Sequana at the Seine’s source,
and a sanctuary honoring Matrona near the source of the Marne. At the
source of the Seine were found many ex votos, including 190 wooden
objects. Some represent complete human figures while others represent
182 / The Celtic Religion



diseased parts of the body, reflecting the worshipers’ great expectations
that the goddess would heal them. The goddess herself was portrayed in
bronze standing on a duck-shaped boat. She wears a loose, folded gar
ment and a crown, her hands stretched before her in blessing. (The statue
is 61.5 centimeters high and is housed in the Musée Archéologique de
Dijon, Cote-d’Or, France.)
The Celts called the great-goddess Matrona. Some inscriptions bear the
name matronae, “the mothers,” and they frequently portray the goddess
as a triad, a group of three. They carry baskets of fruit, cornucopias, and
babies. On a recently discovered Gaulish inscription the goddess is called
Rigantona, “the great queen”; this name appears in the Welsh Mabinogi as
Rhiannon. In the Mabinogi there is the character Mabon ap Modron: that
is, Maponos son of Matrona. Maponos, “the youthful one” or “divine youth,”
is a Gaulish and British god. That he derives his name from his mother
emphasizes the importance of the female line.
Related to Matrona and the Greek Artemis was the bear goddess Artio
(“the bear” in Gaulish was probably *artos, in Irish, art).6 In the second
or third century a .d ., a woman named Licinia Sabinilla dedicated a
bronze sculpture group to the goddess Artio (it was rediscovered in frag
ments at Muri near Berne, Switzerland, in 1832). In its present form at
the Historical Museum in Berne it shows a seated female divinity with her
lap full of fruit, holding a bowl in her right hand; a female bear (measur
ing 12 centimeters high), its back to a tree, faces her. The pedestal bears
the inscription DEAE ARTIONI LICINIA SABINILLA, “For the goddess
Artio, Licinia Sabinilla [dedicates this offering].” A more thorough exam
ination of the sculpture reveals that instead of a group, originally there
was only the bear, Artio, crouched in front of the tree. Epigraphs dedi
cated to the goddess Artio have also been found in the Rhinish Palatinate
(near Bitburg), in northern Germany (Stockstadt, Heddemheim), and in
Spain (Sigüenza or Huerta).
Another form of the Gaulish-Celtic goddess who gained great popu
larity in the Romano-Celtic world was Epona, protectress of horses. She
was most often represented riding sidesaddle on a horse, sometimes accom
panied by a dog, a bird, or a foal. She is an Indo-European creation, since
the Indo-Europeans considered the horse to be sacred. One of her Gaul
ish centers of worship was Alesia in Burgundy, east-central France. Epona
was imported into Britain and Ireland during the period of Roman dom
inance. Here, her equivalents are the British Rhiannon and Irish Macha,
both of whom show marked equine associations. For instance, an Irish
Macha, the wife of the peasant Crunnchu, races against the fastest horses
in the land— and wins— while on the verge of giving birth to twins.

THE SURVIVAL OF OLD EUROPEAN DEITIES
IN IRELAND AND BRITAIN
With the decline of the Celts on the European mainland, the British Isles
became the last stronghold of Celtic culture. Much of our evidence for
Celtic art, religion, and social structure comes from these islands. Britain
and Ireland lend us particularly significant information because, as islands,
they remained insular and less influenced by changes on the continent.
Although the Romans conquered Britain as far as southern Scotland, dis
rupting those Celtic cultures in the defeated areas, the Romans left Ire
land untouched. Here, the Celtic heritage and oral tradition continued
uninterrupted.
The Irish oral tradition became a written one because Ireland and Britain
converted to Christianity in the fifth century a .d . With the building of the
monasteries, Ireland became a center of European learning, and the Chris
tian monks introduced writing to the Celtic peoples. Although mainly con
cerned with copying Christian beliefs, the scribes, many of whom were
Irish, also wrote down pre-Christian pagan legends in the scriptoria of
the monasteries. The transcription of Irish oral tradition had begun by
the end of the sixth century a .d ., but only a few manuscript fragments
survive from before a .d . 1100. Like Ireland, the Celtic country of Wales
maintained great manuscript compilations, the earliest from around the
end of the twelfth century a .d . The Welsh compilation, the Mabinogi, con
stitutes one of the most important sources for British mythology.
It is remarkable that, in spite of both Indo-European and Christian influ
ence, the Irish and Welsh oral tradition and historic records preserved the
primary Old European goddesses— especially the life giver and death
wielder— with little change since Neolithic times. Some of their ancient
features survived up to the eighteenth century. Some are remembered to
this day in folk beliefs and rites. These goddesses, whose attributes some
times overlap, are known as Brigid, Ana (or Anu or Danu), the Morrigan,
Macha, and Badb.
In folk beliefs, Brigid (Brighid; Scottish, Bride) still walks and visits
houses in Irish villages. Her presence is felt in sacred wells, streams, trees,
and stones. Brigid is an Old European goddess consigned to the guise of
a Christian saint. Remove the guise and you will see the mistress of nature,
an incarnation of cosmic life-giving energy, the owner of life water in wells
and springs, the bestower of human, animal, and plant life. Her myths
reveal that she assists at birth, as does the Cretan Eileithyia. She spins and
weaves human life. Today people still leave woven offerings to her, such
as rags, towels, and ribbons, on trees, or on bushes at her wells or streams.
Her wells are sacred, and they contain the great miraculous healing power
184 / The Celtic Religion



of the goddess. Ring dances around wells and menhirs are performed to
evoke her powers. Her very ancient features are especially visible when
nature awakens, around February first. Then she, the queen, appears as
a snake from the mound (“This is the day of Bride, the Queen will come
from the mound”are words that come from a song still heard around 1900).
Her feast on February first, Imbolc, celebrated the first signs of spring and
the lactation of the ewes, symbolizing new life. It was the day of purifi
cation and homage to the goddess. People poured milk on the ground as
an offering and baked special cakes. Girls carried dolls in her image in
procession through the town, and each house welcomed the goddess. These
celebrations endured well through the Christian era, when Imbolc became
St. Bridget’s Day.
The death goddess, the Neolithic vulture goddess and tomb goddess,
became known in Old Irish tradition as Ana (or Anna, Anu, or Danu).
She gave her name to the legendary Tuatha De Danann (or Anann) tribe,
the “People of the goddess Danu (or Anu)” (genitive case: Anann).7 As
Anu, she was “mother of gods.” This ancient name for the goddess is well
attested in the Mediterranean and Near Eastern world as meaning “mother”
or “foster mother.” Ana and Annia appear as names for caves and tombs.
She was the mother of the dead and the regenerator of nature as well. Her
life-giving, nourishing breasts are identified with a pair of hills in County
Kerry, “Da Chich Anann,” the Paps of Ana.8 This appellation recalls the
megalithic tomb era five thousand or more years earlier, when people sculp
tured breasts on tomb walls and menhirs.
The legend of the Caillech Bherri, “The Old Woman of Berre,” docu
mented Ana in a character well known in modern Irish folklore. Her name
connects her with a peninsula in southwestern Ireland, but her folkloric
presence is much deeper, extending throughout Ireland and Gaelic Scot
land. Legends tell that she created cairns in County Meath by dropping
stones from her apron, that she moved islands in west Kerry, and that she
carried rocks in her creel to build mountains in Scotland. Additionally,
she was “queen of Limerick fairies.” She is closely connected with the great
megalithic monuments of Knowth in County Meath.
In other traditions, Caillech Bherri becomes a divine ancestress with
numerous offspring, an embodiment of longevity who repeatedly experi
enced the cycle of youth and old age. This goddess was not only intimately
related to the land and its prosperity; she also symbolized spiritual and
legal dominion over the land and the king. She was the goddess of sov
ereignty, known in myth as Flaith and in saga as Queen Medb, “the intox
icating one.”9 This goddess symbolized the land to whom the king is
wedded. As Medb of Leinster, she cohabited with nine kings of Ireland,
and of her it was written: “Great indeed was the power and influence of
185 / The Celtic Religion



Medb over the men of Ireland, for she it was who would not permit a king
in Tara unless he had her for his wife” (Book ofLeinster, 380a).
The same goddess appears in tales as the Morrigan or Macha or Badb,
a crow goddess, a death messenger perched on pillars or trees. She can
be one or three, either all named Macha or each with a separate name:
Neman, Macha, and the Morrigan. The Morrigan possesses many faces.
At one time she is a most beautiful queen; at another time, she is a beaked,
gray badb, a “crow.” As a shape changer, she can become a greyhound, an
eel, a red hornless heifer, a red-haired woman driving a cow, and an old
woman milking a three-teated cow. Like the Greek Athena, the Morrigan
was militarized: in Gaul she already appeared as a war goddess, and the
process of her militarization could have begun earlier, perhaps as early as
the Bronze Age. Literary records describe the Morrigan or the triple god
dess (Macha, Neman, and the Morrigan) as terrible Furies, able to confound
whole armies. In battle, they appear as crows, shrieking and fluttering
furiously over the heads of warriors.
During the battle of Magh Tuiredh (described in the Book o f Leinster,
93: 2), Badb, Macha, and the Morrigan manifested fog-sustaining shower
clouds and poured down enormous masses of fire and streams of red blood
from the air. Described at the battle of Almu near Kildare,10 they appeared
as red-mouthed, sharp-beaked, croaking badbs over the warriors’ heads,
creating panic and lunacy.
In Irish folk tradition of the last centuries, the death messenger appears
as a little woman dressed in white, or sometimes as a tall, slim, and ugly
woman. She is heard as a bird’s cry, lonesome and mournful, frequently
repeated three times. As a harbinger of death she takes the shape of a bird
that sits on the windowsill where an ill person sleeps. As a death mes
senger she also manifests as a washerwoman, and in the eighteenth cen
tury, she merged with the image of a banshee,11 an anthropomorphic fairy.
Conclusions
Both Old European and Indo-European deities comprise the Celtic pan
theon.12 The Gundestrup cauldron portrays female figures associated with
birds, and male and female figures surrounded by animals. The former
represent the Old European goddess of death and regeneration, and the
latter represent the Old European mistress and master of animals.
After the Romans conquered Gaul, they wrote descriptions of the Celtic
pantheon, using Roman names to describe Celtic deities: Mercury, Apollo,
Mars, Jupiter, and Minerva. Statues inscribed to Matrona or the triple
matronae, the Celtic “mothers,” have also been discovered. Matrona was
most likely the great-goddess in both her singular and multiple forms. The
186 / The Celtic Religion



Celts also worshiped Dea Artio, “bear goddess,”a descendant of Old Europe,
and the horse goddess Epona, probably an Indo-European creation.
Historic deities among the Irish Celts include descendants of the Old
European bird goddess: the Morrigan, Macha, and Badb. The multifunc
tional goddess Brigid was descended from the Old European great
goddess and assimilated into Irish Christianity as Saint Brigid.
Other Celtic forms of the Old European great-goddess of birth, death,
and rebirth include Queen Medb, an epicized goddess who represented
the sovereignty of the land, and the triple Macha. The goddess of death
survived into later Irish folklore, where she was known as the Caillech
Bherri, the “Old Woman of Berre,” and the banshee, the woman of the fairy
mound.

CHAPTER TWELVE
The Germanic Religion
T
he origin of the Germanic-speaking peoples of Europe and the for
mation of their culture have much in common with the cultures of
the Celtic, Baltic, Slavic, and Italic peoples. Linguists have discovered
that their languages shared several terms that did not appear in other sis
ter-languages: Indo-Iranian, Greek, and Armenian. This supports the
hypothesis that a northwestern Indo-European linguistic community once
existed that shared inherited terms from the same cultural substrate.
Archaeological evidence shows very much the same phenomenon. All of
these Indo-European branches, which formed in northern and central
Europe after 3 0 0 0 b .c ., are derived from an earlier culture: the Globular
Amphora culture of the second half of the fourth millennium b .c ., which
occupied the area north of the Carpathian Mountains, between Denmark
and western Ukraine. This culture formed after the Kurgan peoples infil
trated the area from the region north of the Black Sea, a result of the Kur
gan superimposition and gradual amalgamation with the Old European
substratum (the Cucuteni and the Funnel-necked Beaker cultures).
Radiocarbon dates confirm that the Globular Amphora culture coexisted
with the Funnel-necked Beaker culture in Germany and Poland for nearly
one thousand years. Such a long coexistence must have greatly influenced
the formation of linguistic families. The next wave of Kurgan infiltration
(Kurgan Wave 3) into east-central Europe, in the early third millennium
b .c ., forced the Globular Amphora people to shift northwestward into
southern Scandinavia, and northeastward into southern Finland and cen
tral Russia.1Archaeologically, the spread of the Corded ware (subsequent
to Globular Amphora) cultural artifacts traces this movement, marking
the beginning of the Indo-European presence in northern Europe. The
new population expanded from central Europe to the north and initially
188



constituted a mere superstratum to a long-established group of peoples.
A long coexistence was followed by gradual intermingling and inter
marriage of the local population with the newcomers. This amalgama
tion gave rise to the nuclei of two northern European Indo-European
language families: the Germanic in the northwest and the Baltic in the
northeast.
In the Bronze Age, northwestern Europe— Denmark, southern Scan
dinavia, and northwestern Germany— comprised a Proto-Germanic cul
tural area from which many tribal groups branched off.2This cultural area
differed distinctly from its central European and eastern Baltic neighbors
in tools, weapons, ceramics, burial rites, ornamentation of bronze arti
facts, and many other phenomena. Throughout the whole second mil
lennium b .c ., the northwestern European culture developed gradually
and apparently peacefully, with no major migrations. Such migrations,
beginning in the early Iron Age, would change the course of European
history.
By the time ofJulius Caesar in the first century b .c ., the Germanic peo
ples had established themselves west of the Rhine and had invaded south
ern Gaul and northern Italy. After their initial defeat by the Romans, some
Germanic tribes were incorporated into the Roman Empire. But in a .d . 9,
the Germanic peoples, led by Arminius (Hermann), revolted against Rome.
The victorious Germanic peoples destroyed the army of Publius Quinc
tilius Varus in the Teutoburg Forest (identified by excavation north of
Osnabrück). This constituted the first major disaster for the Romans at
the hands of the Germanic peoples.
In the closing centuries b .c ., the Vandals, Gepidae, and Goths descended
from southern Sweden to the southern Baltic coast, and from there
expanded farther west and south, at the expense of the Celtic peoples.
The Goths migrated southeastward to Ukraine and Romania in the sec
ond century A.D.
The southern Germanic tribes were converted to Christianity much ear
lier than those in the north. The Goths already had a bishop by a .d 325.
The Germanic peoples who moved into the Roman provinces before the
fall of the western Roman Empire were Christianized during the fifth cen
tury a .d .: the Vandals in Spain (4 0 9 -4 2 9 ), the Burgundians in eastern Gaul
(4 1 2 -4 3 6 ), the Ostrogoths in Pannonia (4 5 6 -4 7 2 ), the Rugii north of the
Danube in Austria (before 482). Farther north, conversion came later.
England became a Christian country in the seventh century, and the Old
Saxons on the continent converted to Christianity during the second half
of the eighth century. Missionaries succeeded in converting the Scandi
navians during the course of the tenth and eleventh centuries. Iceland was
189 / The Germanic Religion



officially Christianized in a .d . 1000 but remained faithful to the ancestral
religion until the thirteenth century. This enabled thirteenth-century
Christian humanists to record ancient beliefs and preserve them for pos
terity. Sweden was the last Germanic stronghold of both Old European
and Indo-European paganism.
These conversions were far from smooth. The brutality of forced con
version reached its climax in the year a .d . 772, when the Frankish
emperor Charlemagne massacred thirty thousand Saxons who refused to
accept Christianity. In addition, the Irminsul, the sacred ash tree that sym
bolized the mythic world-tree, Yggdrasil— the holy axis— was cut down.
(Such a desecration could be comparable to the destruction of St. Peter’s
for Catholic Christians.) We shall now turn to these northern regions, where
the populace still upheld pagan customs and beliefs in the thirteenth cen
tury, when monks finally transcribed the sagas.
The main sources for Viking Age mythology are the poetic Edda, a col
lection of poems and other fragments compiled in Iceland during the thir
teenth century, and the prose Edda, a handbook for poets written by the
thirteenth-century humanist Snorri Sturluson (this is the best introduc
tion to Norse mythology); Saxo Grammaticus’ History o f Denmark, com
pleted around 1215, in which the author describes the Scandinavian
mythological tradition and gives somewhat different versions of myths
depicted in the prose Edda; Adam of Bremen, who chronicled Swedish
pagan festivals in his History o f the Bishops o f Hamburg (1 0 7 4 -8 3 ); reports
of other Christian authors; and the skaldic poetry and sagas. Some infor
mation also comes from the Old English epic poem Beowulf, dating from
around 1000 b .c ., which tells of the exploits of a Scandinavian hero.
Very few sources exist before the Viking Age, except for the runes; their
magical and religious messages are particularly interesting.3 1believe that
they continue, at least to some degree, the tradition of Old European sacred
script, and that their importance lies in the fact that they stem from pre
history. The oldest form of runic writing, the Elder Futhark, was prac
ticed as late as the early Christian era. (The oldest object with runic writing
is the Meldorf brooch, dating to around 50 a .d ., found on the west coast
of Jutland.) The twenty-four-sign alphabet appears on a standing stone
in Kylver, Sweden, dated to about the fifth century a .d . Runic writing
lasted until around a .d . 1000. There are several important efforts to incor
porate runes as a viable source for Old Norse mythology (cf. Gitlin-Emmer
1993).
The following text focuses on gods and goddesses of Old European
descent who survived until the thirteenth and later centuries, despite the
strong presence of Indo-European male warrior deities and the introduc
tion of Christianity.
190 / The Germanic Religion



Germanic Deities: The Vanir and Aesir
The world of religious myth reflects social reality. Earlier chapters discussed
how Indo-European religion, with its emphasis on male warrior deities
and the sky, reflected the mobile, patriarchal culture of the steppes, as well
as how Greek mythology mirrored the violent takeover of Old European
cultures by Indo-European tribes on the Greek peninsula.
In Germanic religion, the coexistence of two religions, the Old Euro
pean and the Indo-European, is clearly distinguished by two separate fam
ilies of deities: the Vanir and the Aesir. The Vanir represent the indigenous,
Old European deities, fertile and life giving. In contrast, the Aesir embody
the Indo-European warrior deities of a patriarchal people. The principal
Vanir deities were Nerthus, the earth mother, who does not appear in Scan
dinavian myth but is described by the Roman historian Tacitus in his Ger
mania during the first century a .d .; the sea god, Njprdr; Freyja, the life giver
and protectress of young life, and the magician goddess of death and regen
eration; and her twin brother, Freyr, the god of peace, abundance, and
fertility. The principal Aesir deities, those of Indo-European descent, were
Tyr, Thor, and Odin (Wotan). Tyr was a god of war and justice similar to
the Roman Mars; Thor (or Donar) was a strong, brave thunder god who
fought against monsters; and Odin was not only god of death and the
underworld, but also the god of poets, prophetic seers, and warriors. Odin’s
name is derived from the Old Norse word odr, “possessed,” and thus con
nected to inspiration, trance, ecstasy, intoxication, and rage.4 Myths refer
to Odin-Wotan as “All-Father”; he helped to create the world. Through
out Germanic mythology, as told in the Eddas, the Vanir and the Aesir met
in continuous rivalry and occasionally combat, but, quite surprisingly, the
conflict is resolved: a ritual reconciliation takes place and “ambassadors”
are exchanged. The peacemaking between the two sets of deities may reflect
the gradual reconciliation over centuries between the local Old European
population and the Indo-European invaders. Interestingly, the Aesir male
warrior deities did not rape Vanir goddesses (as Zeus raped Greek god
desses and heroines), but they did intermarry. We can particularly dis
cern the Vanir influence on Aesir deities in the realm of magic and prophecy
(for example, Freyja taught seidr, “witchcraft,” to Odin; see below) and in
belief in the underworld.
THE VANIR DEITIES
The Vanir deities, who were descended from Old European goddesses and
gods, lived in Vanaheim, west of the central plain of the world-tree, in the
land of fruitful fields, abundant fresh waters, and luxuriant green plant
growth, a land of peaceful pleasure, of magic and creative play. The Roman
191 / The Germanic Religion



historian Tacitus, in the first century a .d . , left us valuable information about
a vegetation festival held by the seven tribes of the lower Elbe River. He
says,
The tribes revere in common Nerthus, the earth mother (Nerthum, id est Terrain Matron), and they believe that she intervenes in human affairs and that she rides among their peoples. In an island of the ocean stands a sacred grove and in the grove stands a cart draped with a cloth which none but the priest may touch. The priest can feel the presence of the goddess in the holy of holies, and attends her, in deepest reverence, as her cart is drawn by cows. Then follow days of rejoicing and merry-making in every place that she honors with her advent and stay. No one goes to war; no one takes up arms; every object of iron is locked away; then, and then only, are peace and quiet known and prized, until the goddess is again restored to her temple by the priest, when she has had her fill of the society of men. After that, the cart, and, believe if you will, the goddess herself, are washed clean in a secluded lake. This service is performed by slaves who are immediately afterwards drowned in the lake.5
Tacitus does not tell us what kind of image the tribes carried on the
cart. Most likely it held a wooden statue of the goddess. He also does not
mention when this event took place, but it resembles a spring celebration
of an agricultural goddess, perhaps similar to the Greco-Roman festival,
Sementiva, dedicated to the pregnant grain goddess. The procession of
the goddess’ statue would have served to protect the sown fields and secure
vegetal prosperity. The goddess was apparently ritually bathed once each
year. (Kybele, a Magna Mater of Asia Minor introduced into Rome in 204
b .c ., was also celebrated in an early spring procession and bathed in a
stream. Cleansing the goddess symbolized purification and renewal of the
goddess’ powers.)6
TheNorns
The three Noms, the old, wise Germanic fates, harken from deep antiq
uity. Sometimes they mysteriously appear as three mighty women. They
emerge from the spring beneath the world-tree, Yggdrasil. The V0luspd,
the “Prophecy of the Seeress,” says, “From there came three women, great
knowledge they had . . . [T]hey carve the stones, they determine the fates
of human children, the length of their lives.”7Even the Aesir deities feared
this Germanic triple goddess, inherited from Old Europe. According to
the V0luspa, the Aesir deities were sitting around happily playing board
games, with not a care in the world, when three powerful females came
along and spoiled the game. The women’s power overrode the decisions
of the Aesir deities! These were the three Norns, later named Urd,
Verdandi, and Skuld. Urd means “fate” or “destiny”; Verdandi indicates to
“turn,” to “become”; and Skuld means “shall,” “must,” “a debt,”in the sense
192 / The Germanic Religion



of fate, law, and duty. In Snorri Sturluson’s time, during the thirteenth cen
tury a .d ., and in subsequent centuries, the populace strongly believed that
these three goddesses represented the three basic determining forces of
human lives. In folk beliefs up to the twentieth century, it was said that
their mysterious powers exerted influence on every human being.
Voluspa verse 21 speaks of the “origin of war,” when the Aesir attacked
the Vanir sorceress Gullveig. The Aesir speared and burned her, again and
again and again, in the war-father Odin’s hall.8
Freyja
The most renowned Vanir goddess was Freyja, who clearly preserved
several features of the Old European great-goddess: life giver, life taker,
and regeneratrix. In Germanic areas, she retained several names. In Den
mark she is Gefion; her name is related to Old Norse gefa, “to give.”Hence,
she is a giver, most likely in the sense of “giver of all” or “giver of new life
in the spring.” The cuckoo, the messenger of spring, is sacred to Freyja.
Bulls, which are animals replete with life energy, were sacrificed to her.
She oversees the birth of children; women in labor invoke her. This attri
bute clarifies her relationship to the Greek Artemis-Eileithyia, giver of life,
and the protectress of young life. She is one and she is three, inseparable
from the Noms, the supernatural women, spinners of fate, the “three maid
ens sitting on three chairs,” who determine the destiny of the newborn
child.
According to Snorri Sturluson, Freyja married an absentee husband,
Odr, for whom she weeps and searches worldwide. This behavior may be
interpreted as mourning for the dead lover with whom she mated in a
sacred marriage, but who consequently died (or was killed) as a dying
vegetation spirit. Besides her life-giving and womb-opening capacities,
Freyja safeguards the sexuality of youth and protects marriageable girls.
Not less importantly, Freyja’s powers extended into the world of death
and magic. On the battlefield, half of the dead belong to her, the other
half to Odin. She appears as a falcon or a she-goat, traveling in a carriage
drawn by cats or riding on the back of a boar, the animal associated with
death. The boar or sow is her special animal. Her legend recounts that
she was the first to teach witchcraft, seidr, to the Aesir; in fact, Odin’s
shamanism very likely is derived from Freyja’s.
Freyja was clearly one goddess of the entire life cycle. Her counter
parts in other parts of Indo-European Europe usually comprise two god
desses, or one such goddess having two names, such as the Greek
Artemis-Hekate or Baltic Laima-Ragana. She manifests herself as life and
birth giver. Being full of life powers, she is also goddess of love.9 How
193 / The Germanic Religion



ever, her powers encompass death and magic, though she is not a fright
ening destroyer like Hekate, Ragana, or the Russian Baba Yaga. With such
a wide range of functions and manifestations, it is obvious why Freyja
remained the most important Nordic deity
The Volva
Sturluson and other sources disclose that Freyja closely identified with
the chief practitioner of seidr, the Volva: a wise woman, seeress, and author
ity in rites of divination who was surrounded by nine female sages. The
Volva is described as wearing a costume of animal skins, including boots
of calfskin and gloves of catskin, perhaps in the likeness of Freyja’s cos
tume. The goddess seems to have been a formidable shaman and the divine
predecessor of both later wise women and demonized witches.
Frigg
Another Germanic goddess is the Swedish Frigg. She was wife of Odin
(German Frija— a name distinct from Freyja— wife of Wotan/Wodan),
whose special day was Friday, “Frigg’s day.” Marrying an important Indo
European god placed this goddess within the patriarchal pantheon, but
otherwise she retained features similar to Freyja’s. Frigg is referred to as
“the mother of all the gods,” a title associated with the great-goddess in
several mythologies. Her handmaiden, Fulla (“abundance”), who has long
golden hair, distributes gifts from Frigg’s coffer: a metaphor for the womb
of the goddess, similar to Pandora’s box in Greek mythology.10
Valkyrie
The death goddess appears in other European regions as a battlefield
raptor, such as the Irish Morrigan or Badb (crow), or the Greek Athena
(owl). But in Norse mythology, she becomes the battle maiden, Valkyrie,
who echoes the Old European vulture goddess. Her name, val-kyrja, means
“corpse-choosing.” As a destroyer, she brings hail that damages or kills
crops and livestock. On the other hand, she is linked with renewal and
regeneration. In myths, multiple Valkyries appear as swan maidens who
sometimes throw off their swan guises and become human maidens who
bathe in secluded streams. These waterbirds, returning to the north from
their southern migrations, symbolize seasonal renewal.
Skadi
Still another death-winter goddess, Skadi, inhabits Old Norse mythol
ogy. Her name may be identified with the Old Norse noun skadi, “harm,
death.” Her sacred animal is the wolf, who eats the bodies of the dead.
She travels on snowshoes and loves the lands of ice and snow.
194 / The Germanic Religion



Hel/Holla
The oral tradition of Germany preserves the ancient goddess of death
and regeneration in many forms: in the figure of Hel/Holle, Holla (best
known as Frau Holla from Grimms’ fairy tales) and as Holda, Berchta, and
Perchta. Myths portray her as nightmarish and fearsome, like the Greek
Hekate. She appears with her wolf-dogs, who rip the flesh from the corpse.
As mother of the dead, she escorts the dead to the otherworld in the inner
depths of mountains and caves. Holler, Holder, Hollunder is the name for
the elder tree, sacred to Holla, under which the dead reside. Although an
ugly old hag with long, powerful hair, Holla is also a regeneratrix. She
brings out the sun, and as a frog, she retrieves the red apple, symbol of
life, from the well into which it falls at harvest. W hen ice melts in the
spring, Holla sometimes appears as a beautiful nude woman bathing in a
stream or lake. Then she personifies the returning powers of life after win
ter, as the dangerous death hag turns into a young spring maiden.
The images of Freyja, Valkyrie, and Holla witness the continuity of the
Old European goddess as life giver, death wielder, and regeneratrix. She
can be young, beautiful, and strong, or old, ugly, and powerful, repre
senting a full cycle from birth to death to rebirth. As the most influential
magician goddess, she rules over both the living and the dead.
Freyja and Freyr
Snorri Sturluson recounts that Freyja and Freyr were chief deities of the
Vanir and calls Freyr “god of the world,” much loved by the Swedes. They
invoked Freyr to bring good crops and maintain peace. He journeys through
the land during autumn to bless the season. In accordance with Freyr’s
peacekeeping role, he banned weapons from his temples. Bloodshed on
his sacred land angers him. Strongly at odds with the Indo-European male
warrior deities, Freyr, like his sister, Freyja, is connected with childbirth
and marriage. According to Adam of Bremen, who lived in the eleventh
century a .d ., Freyr’s image in the temple of Uppsala was a phallic one. This
phallic portrayal recalls Hermes, the Greek god who led souls to the after
world; he was god of commerce, communication, and luck, bringer of wealth
and joy, whose cult monument was simply the phallus. Just as Hermes was
a god of the underworld and regeneration, Freyr too has links with death
and regeneration. Typically, his totem is the boar, an animal incarnation of
the death goddess or god. Another of his symbols is the ship Skidbladnir,
a vessel large enough to hold all the gods and capable of being folded up
when not in use. His ship could have been used in processions for cere
monies of blessing the land and also for regenerative rituals in funerals.
Like Freyja, Freyr also possesses oracular powers and foretells the future.
195 / The Germanic Religion



In Uppsala, as Adam of Bremen reports, Freyr erected the great temple that
became Sweden’s religious center. There, he was honored every nine years
by nine-day-long sacrificial rites.
The brother and sister pair, Freyr and Freyja, as the major Vanir deities,
clearly stem from the Neolithic or even earlier. Their rare preservation up
to medieval times documents a balanced pair of male and female deities
that had long since disappeared in other parts of Europe. Their equal impor
tance sheds light on the balance in Old European society before the advent
of the Indo-Europeans.
Conclusions
Historic records preserve no other deities of the pre-Indo-European Vanir
with any clarity, except for memories of the divine child, and the vegeta
tion god, who is bom , matures, dies, and is lamented for his premature
death. For instance, in the opening section of the Old English poem Beowulf,
the royal ancestor of the Danes, Scyld, came across the sea to Denmark
as a child, became a king, and then departed again over the sea. Another
version of the story relates that the child came over the sea with a sheaf
of com. Baldr, one of the most beloved of those in Âsgard, is said to be
the son of Odin. But an impressive description by Snorri Sturluson of his
death, and the grief and lamentation it caused, discloses that Baldr may
have been a god of vegetation in the Vanir family. Like the Greek Linos
and Adonis, the Egyptian Osiris, and the Mesopotamian Dumuzi and Tam
muz, the goddess destined him to die to renew the land.
When scholars have applied Georges Dumézü’s tripartite division11 to
Norse gods, the Vanir deities have traditionally belonged to the third cat
egory of “fertility” gods. This classification is rather misleading. The Vanir
do not represent a third and lesser class of Indo-European deities; they
exemplify Old European deities whom the Indo-Europeans elaborately
assimilated into the Germanic pantheon.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN
The Baltic Religion
T
he Baltic region, comprising Lithuania, Latvia, Finland, and Estonia,
perhaps represents the greatest repository of Old European beliefs and
traditions. Here, pagan religion persisted not through millennium-old his
toric sagas but via oral traditions and customs that endured to the twen
tieth century. The Balts were the last pagans of Europe. Christianity came
to Lithuania, not in the fifth century, as in Ireland, but at the end of the
fourteenth century. In fact, it reached farming people some two to three
hundred years later. As a result, the Christian layer of beliefs among the
Balts is very thin.
The Baltic speakers originated (as a distinct linguistic family of the Indo
European “family tree”) much like the Germanic speakers did. Both formed
in northern Europe from the gradual amalgam of immigrants from cen
tral Europe— the Corded ware people— with the local inhabitants. From
about 2900 to 250 0 b .c . , the northeastern branch of the Corded ware cul
ture spread as far north as southern Finland and as far east as central Rus
sia, even beyond the modem city of Moscow. A Proto-Baltic culture formed
during the course of the late third and early second millennia b .c . out of
the East Baltic Corded ware culture and the Fat’yanovo and Middle Dnieper
cultures in central Russia. This new fusion gave rise to a number of regional
groups that continued throughout the Bronze and early Iron Ages. Thou
sands of river names of Baltic origin evidence the presence of Baltic speak
ers over a large area between Pomerania in modem Poland and central
Russia. The maritime Balts formed from the substratum of the Neolithic
Narva culture. In this large area of northeastern Europe, no territorial
changes took place until the migrations of the Germanic Goth in the sec
ond century a .d . and the Slavic movements northward into the Dnieper
Basin during the sixth to seventh centuries a .d . During the eighth to twelfth
centuries a .d ., Slavic language and culture came to dominate about half
197



of the eastern Baltic lands. The Baltic western coastal territories (the lands
of the Prussians, Curonians, Lithuanians, and Letts) remained the most
prosperous throughout prehistory. The Romans in particular prized Baltic
amber and traded extensively with central Europe.
The situation changed drastically in the early thirteenth century when
Teutonic knights set out to convert “the last pagans” (at sword point, of
course). The Prussians and Lithuanians refused to accept Christianity, since
the war not only included conversion to a new creed; it was also an aggres
sion, a Drang nach Osten,1 and a cruel ethnic extermination. During the
thirteenth century, the knights finally conquered the Prussians, leaving
few survivors. (The Prussian language, a western Baltic language, could
be heard on the Samland peninsula until about 1700.)2 The knights moved
on to Lithuania, on the river Nemunas, where the invasion continued inter
mittently throughout the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries. The Ger
manic aggression was stopped, except for the colonization of the northern
Baltic territories via the Baltic Sea. In 1201 a bishopric was founded in
Riga, which remained a German stronghold for centuries to come.
The Endurance o f Old European Beliefs
Lithuania officially became a Christian country in 1387, when the Lithuan
ian grand duke Jogaillo married Jadwiga, a Hungarian princess who had
become queen of Poland two years earlier. The duke’s baptism, however,
was not copied by the peasants. Christian missionaries remained foreigners
with no understanding of the local language, so they found it difficult to
communicate with and convert the peasants. Pagan beliefs continued
unhindered for centuries. A letter by Bishop Merkelis Giedraitis to theJesuit
General, dated 1587, vividly illustrated the strength of the ancient reli
gion at the end of the sixteenth century: “You would not find a single man
[sic] in the greater part of our bishopry who would go to confession and
take communion, know prayers (Pater Noster) or how to cross; you would
not find a man who has any understanding of the secrets of our [Chris
tian] creed. They make sacrifices to Perkūnas [a thunder god], they wor
ship serpents, and hold oak-trees sacred. They offer food to the dead and
many other strange things more from ignorance than ill w ill. . . ” (Ivin
skis 1986). Many other authors from the sixteenth to the twentieth cen
turies described pagan rituals, especially concerning harvest customs and
the worship of Žemyna, the earth mother, and Laima, or fate, who gov
erns human life, controlling birth and death.
The study of Baltic mythology and religion draws upon historical,
archaeological, ethnographic, and folkloric sources. References to pre
Christian Baltic religion begin with the Roman historian Tacitus in the first
198 / The Baltic Religion



century a .D. and continue from medieval times through the seventeenth
century Many of the historical records concerning the ancient religion have
been published (most important is W Mannhardt’s Letto-Preussische Got
terlehre, 1936), but they remain insufficient for the reconstruction of a more
complete picture of this religion. The wealth of folkloric-mythological songs
(richly preserved in Latvia), tales, riddles, charms, and rituals that con
tinued into the twentieth century hold the key to understanding these
ancient beliefs.3
Lithuanian and Latvian written and oral sources did not separate pre
Christian deities into two groups like the Vanir and Aesir in Scandinavia.
Rather, the Old European matristic and the Indo-European patristic
deities existed side by side for millennia with little intermingling. The Baltic
Dievas, the Indo-European god of the shining sky; Perkūnas, the thun
der god; and Vėlinąs or Vels, god of death and the underworld, could not
transform the Old European goddesses into lovers, wives, and daughters.
Laima, the life giver and fate, appears not as a wife but as an equal part
ner with Dievas, both blessing the fields at summer solstice. Mother Earth
Žemyna was a powerful goddess of plant and human fertility; after assim
ilation with the Indo-Europeans, folkloric beliefs attributed her insemi
nation to the thunder god, Perkūnas, via the first lightning of early spring.
This was clearly a patriarchal addition to Žemyna’s mythology. Ragana,
now a witch, was originally a goddess of death and regeneration. Her magic,
shamanism, and omniscience influenced the Indo-European Vėlinąs, as
Scandinavian 0 5 in was influenced by Freyja.
The following sections focus on the goddesses and gods of Old Euro
pean origin and disregard Indo-European deities associated with the sky,
horses, cattle, weapons, and physical power. The goddesses take their cre
ative energy from water, the earth, the moon, stones, and plants. They
gather in clans headed by a queen. Some goddesses have male counter
parts, usually brothers, typical of a matrilineal social structure. They main
tain their dual and triple natures, as in the Neolithic. The same goddess
may appear as young and old, as a mother and daughter, or as two sis
ters. She can be a life giver and a death wielder. The triple goddess appears
as three Fates or three white ladies.
Baltic Goddesses and Gods
LAIMA
Known in Latvian as Laima and in Lithuanian as Laimė, the most power
ful Baltic goddess controls the cosmic life energy, as well as the powers of
creation. Laima is Fate. The length of a life, happiness and unhappiness,
199 / The Baltic Religion



wealth and poverty, all depended on her pronouncement. Laima, whether
known singularly or as a triple goddess, remains one and the same deity.
If the first two Laimas decree ambiguously, the third Laima’s pronounce
ment is final.
Lithuanian and Latvian dictionaries of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries witness her existence as both “goddess of Fate” and “goddess of
birth.” Her solid presence in folk beliefs and customs concerning birth
endured as late as the early twentieth century. People believed that at the
birth of a child, Laima, or three Laimas, as Fate or the three Fates, appeared
beneath the window to forecast the child’s fate.
Birth rituals at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of
the twentieth century included offerings to Laima. In Latvia, the birth rit
ual, in which only women participated, was called pirtizas, from pirtis,
meaning “sauna,” since it took place in the sauna. The grandmother
presided over the ritual, which included bathing before the birth and a
feast immediately after the birth. The ritual included the sacrifice of a hen
or a sheep and the presentation of towels, belts, or other woven materi
als to Laima. Records from the end of the seventeenth century indicate
that the hen was killed with a wooden ladle. This certainly must be a very
ancient custom. It evokes the beautifully decorated Neolithic wooden ladles
carved in the shape of water fowl, usually a duck or goose, often found
in peat-bog sites.
Baltic beliefs recall the ancient relationship of Laima with the bear. As
late as the mid-twentieth century, a pregnant woman or mother recently
confined was called the “Bear.” The women congregated in the sauna pro
nounced the formula, “The Bear is coming,”upon seeing the young mother
soon after the birth giving. In the Baltic area, the birth-giving goddess may
have been imagined as a bear, just as she was in Old Europe.
Laima is identified with several sacred trees. In the following Latvian
mythological song, she is identified with the linden tree:
A branchy linden tree grew In my cow stall. This was not a linden tree, This was Laima of my cows. (Biezais 1955, 256, no. 29172)
This tree was considered sacred in earlier days and was surrounded by
a ditch. From other songs we learn that sheep and goats can be bom direcdy
from Laima’s trees, as the following song testifies.
All roadsides were covered with Laima’s trees: From a birch a ewe was bom, From an aspen-tree, a little goat. (Biezais 1955, 192, no. 28963)
200 / The Baltic Religion



It is indeed fascinating to see how life is bom from any living creature
bug, snake, hen, or tree— and that there are no boundaries between them.
The same unifying creative power is in all of creation.
In addition to taking human form, Laima can be a bear, a tree, a hen,
a menhir, or a waterfowl. She has one more important incarnation: the
cuckoo, associated with the spring aspect of this goddess.4 The cuckoo
forecasts a person’s life span, happiness, and marriage. The cuckoo glad
dens people’s hearts in the spring. Peasants rise eagerly on the days of the
first cuckoo’s call, for luck follows the person who hears that cuckoo. A
superstition still prevails that a person will live for as many years as the
cuckoo repeats its call. Just as Laima spins and weaves human life, so too
the cuckoo spins, weaves, or sews with golden or silken threads while
perched on a golden throne:
Sing, O cuckoo, Tell me, cuckoo, Perching on a green spruce, Sitting on a golden throne, Herding the horses of the brothers, Weaving a silken scarf, Sewing with golden threads, Counting my years, How long shall 1 live? (Lithuanian Folklore Archive, V, 917: 9417)
Another folk belief relates that the tree on which the cuckoo sits becomes
sacred and imbued with the powers of the goddess. If a person peels a
piece of bark or breaks a branch of this tree, he or she will know the cuckoo’s
prophecies. Since the cuckoo is an oracle of the spring, it represents the
end of winter’s dominion. After the spring, the cuckoo vanishes and then
returns as a hawk. The belief in the cuckoo’s transformation into a hawk
is widespread.
Laima-Dalia
Laima also apportions material goods: she gives a person his or her
share. Lithuanian folklore recognizes this attribute by her double name
Laima-Dalia, for dalis, “share.” In this aspect, she manifests as a swan or
a ram. Tales abound of swans who turn into beautiful maidens. If a poor
man marries a swan-maiden, she will make him rich and happy. Or one
may, by chance, obtain one of Laima’s enchanted rams and magically
become rich. If Laima does not allot a share, it cannot be obtained by other
means. Even a stone can represent Laima’s share. If an unlucky man gets
a stone, assuming that it might be his “share,” the stone will shrink little
by little each day.
201 / The Baltic Religion



Cow Laima
The “Cow Laima” evokes a sense of deep antiquity. She is preserved in
Latvian mythological songs as Mara, Marsa, or Marsavipa (also written
Mar§avipa). Her titles include “Cow Laima” or “Cow Mother” (in Latvian,
Govu Laima or Mate), or “Mother of Milk,” or “Shepherdess of Cows.”
She owns the spring of life, which is the source of milk in cows. Maja
primarily gives birth to calves. She presides in animal stalls during deliv
ery, not as an anthropomorphic deity, but as a black serpent, a black hen,
or even a black bug. The color black here accentuates fertility, birth, and
multiplication. A number of mythological songs identify the black snake,
hen, or bug in the cow stall as Cow Laima or Cow Mar§avipa, as in these
examples:
A black snake crawled into the stall of my cows. She was not a black snake: She was the Cow Mar§avipa.5
A black (or white) hen crawled into the stall of my cows. She was not a black hen, She was my Cow Mar§avipa.6
The hen (that is, the goddess) magically shakes herself and a stall full of
calves appears:
The black hen shook herself
In my cow garden [stall]; For herself—a full nest [of eggs?] For me— a full stall of calves.7
Peasants offered Mara-Marsa black hens until the eighteenth century.
Lithuanian farmers, upon building a new house, would allow a healthy
egg-producing black hen and a black rooster into the dwelling to ensure
the fertility and happiness of the people and cows. The pair was privi
leged, untouched, well-fed, and never killed. Snakes, too, were honored:
if a snake came to a stall, it was allowed to stay as a good omen, even if
it milked the cows.
Ma^a can produce gigantic, magic cows, as in this song:
Maripa (dim. of Mara) gave me a cow Big, big, wide, wide. Her horns were too large for my stall And there was no place in the garden.8
202 / The Baltic Religion



Other songs mention supernatural cows: they swim in the sea, and they display four large horns. They give
So much milk as there is water in the sea, So much butter as there is sand in the sea. (Biezais 1955, 248, unnumbered)
Mâja-Mârsa is clearly a protectress and bestower of cow fertility and abun
dance of milk. It is obvious that she and Laima (Fate) are one and the same
goddess of birth and mistress of life-giving fluids. The name Mata (in the
diminutive, Maripa) or Mârsa (in the diminutive, Mârsaviçia/Mârçavipa) is
of Old European origin, related to the series of names of goddesses with
the root Mar- (Mara, Mari, Mora, More, and others); it does not derive from
Christian Maria, although in several songs she appears as Maya Magdalena:
clearly a result of assimilation with the name Mary Magdalene.
Gabija
Gabija, the hearth-fire deity, may represent another aspect of Laima.
She resembles the prehistoric bird goddess. It was believed that she pro
tected the house and family, brought fertility and happiness, and stimu
lated cattle and crops. The Lithuanians called this goddess Gabija, from
the verb gaubti, “to cover” or “to protect.”Latvians have uguns mate, “mother
of the fire.”
The Balts imagined the hearth-fire deity as an anthropomorphic god
dess but also as a stork or a cock. The stork protected the house from fire
and thunderstorms and safeguarded the hearth, family, and village com
munity. The stork was the metonymy and epiphany of the goddess. Each
day the hearth-fire deity was fed. When food was prepared, some of it was
thrown on the hearth. A common offering to the fire was bread and salt.
As late as the first decades of the twentieth century in Lithuania, the mother
of the family, while baking bread, first prepared a little loaf for Gabija, mark
ing it with a fingerprint. The anthropomorphic Gabija was treated as a
human being. “To make a bed for Gabija”meant to cover the charcoal with
ashes in the evening. When the family moved into a new home, they first
carried the ancestral hearth fire from the old house to the new.
SNAKES AND THE SNAKE GODDESS
Up to the mid-twentieth century, harmless green snakes often shared the
house with people. They occupied the place of honor, the sacred comer
of the house, and were fed milk in addition to their regular diet. The snake
protected the family, or more exactly, symbolized its life force. Cows also
had their own snakes, symbolizing the life energy and fertility of the cow.
Since the snake embodied life energy, it could not be killed. It was believed
that whoever killed the snake would destroy the happiness of the whole
203 / The Baltic Religion



family and would be paralyzed for the rest of his or her life. If the house
snake lived in the children’s area, it was especially important that the snake
not be harmed or killed. If it were, the child would die. The serpent’s vital
influence extended not only to fertility and increase but to the regenera
tion of dying life-energy. Combined with magic plants, the snake possessed
potent powers in healing and creating life. Snakes hibernate from the fall
until the end of January or early February. In Lithuania, up to this cen
tury peasants celebrated a sacred day of snakes (kirmiu diena) around Jan
uary 25, when snakes symbolically awakened and abandoned the forests
for the houses. This special day marked the beginning of everything, the
awakening of nature. On this day farmers shook the apple trees so that
they would bear fruit, and knocked at beehives to awaken the bees.
During the Neolithic, portrayals of the snake goddess consistently fea
tured a crownlike headpiece. This feature lives on in Baltic and other Euro
pean folklore in the belief that some snakes will appear crowned; these
crowns are the symbol of wisdom and wealth. Folktales narrate that a per
son who struggles with a huge white snake will acquire a crown. The crown
enables one to know all, to see hidden treasures, and to understand the
language of animals. The crowned snake is the queen; fairy tales recorded
three hundred years ago recount the meetings of hundreds of snakes ruled
by a crowned snake. Clearly, these dim memories of the sacredness of
snakes harken back to the Neolithic snake goddess.
AUSTĖJA
Austėja, the bee goddess, mentioned in the sixteenth century, is both
woman and bee; she promotes fertility in humans and bees. Her name is
connected with the verb austi, “to weave,”9 and also “to dart,” “to fly.” Offer
ings were made to her by jumping while tossing the oblation upward to
the ceiling or into the air.
Austėja appears as the idealized bee mother, a responsible homemaker
figure. She ensures that the families (as every beehive community is com
monly called) under her guardianship multiply and increase. Apiculture
can be understood in these beliefs as a metaphor for the human family
where the mother-housekeeper has the most prominent role.
GODDESSES OF DEATH AND REGENERATION
Giltinė
Giltinė is death, sister of Laima. Her name relates to a whole group of
well-known words: gelti (the verb “to sting”), gylys (the noun meaning
“sting”), galas (“the end”), geltonas (“yellow”), and geltlige (yellow jaun
dice, a dread disease). A century ago, she was described as follows: “This
204 / The Baltic Religion



is Death in human form, a woman with a long nose and long tongue, filled
with deadly venom. Draped in a white sheet, by day she roams the ceme
teries seeking coffins of the dead, licking corpses with her tongue to extract
the poison which she uses to destroy the living.”10 She bites human beings;
she strangles, suffocates, or kills them in other ways. Giltinė can be one
or three, and sometimes she appears as a group of white maidens. Gil
tinė knows no obstacles: she can penetrate anywhere. Fences mean noth
ing to her; doors open by themselves. She wanders around like a shadow,
appears on a bridge, in the field, or comes out from behind the bam. At
times she cannot be seen, but she can be heard in the sound of a whip
whistling three times in the air. Or you will hear a strange clattering noise;
dishes may rattle, doors mysteriously open and close. If a shiver goes
through your body, it may be that Giltinė has looked you in the face (or
teeth, in the Lithuanian expression). You can deceive Giltinė for some time.
For instance, you can catch her in a box or a nutshell when she takes a
diminutive shape. In fairy tales about Giltinė and a doctor, the doctor tries
to turn the bed so that Giltinė stays at the feet and not at the head of the
dying man, which means that the man will not die for a while. However,
all these measures are temporary: Giltinė will come out of the nutshell
one way or another. She is Fate and you cannot escape her.
Ragana
Ragana, a goddess of death and regeneration, can be felt especially at
night and at the dark moon. Although degraded to a witch and pushed
deep into the forest during the Christian era, she maintains characteris
tics of a very powerful deity. The name Ragana derives from the verb regėti,
meaning “to see,” “to perceive,” “to divine,” or “to foresee.” The Lithuan
ian word ragas, “horn,” as in ragas mėnulio, “moon’s horn,” “crescent moon,”
suggests Ragana’s relationship with the moon, regeneration, and trans
formation. She can become a crow, a magpie, a swallow, or a quail, but
she can change her shape into any animate or inanimate form. Ragana
also carried the energy of a snake: if a Ragana died, you might see her hair
curl, like a Gorgon’s, into snakes, and little snakes crawl out of her mouth.
Multiple Raganas
Ragana appears as one goddess, but very often legends mention a whole
crowd of raganas, who can take the shape of crows, usually at meetings
on a mountaintop. However, one of the raganas is addressed as “Lady,”
the leader of the group. All others are her assistants in their nightly actions.
They wait for instructions from the “Lady.” After smearing ointment on
themselves, they fly to the mountains or fields, following the directions
of their leader.
205 / The Baltic Religion



As a dangerous hag, Ragana continuously inflicts damage: she ties rye
ears into knots at harvest time, shears too much wool from sheep, stops
milk in cows, places rocks on wells. At weddings she can “spoil the bride”
make her sterile— or turn the bridegroom into a wolf or dog. On a cos
mic scale, she can cut the full moon in half or even cause an eclipse of the
sun. Ragana oversees the cyclicity of nature: she balances the life-energy.
She stops blossoming and growing lest plants and the moon grow forever.
Ragana also controls male sexuality. She dominates men, often utterly
exhausting them after a night’s orgy. She kills the life power in order to
secure the cyclical renewal of life energy. She knows the magic of herbs:
with them she heals the sick, regenerates life, restores life to the dead.
The main epiphany of Ragana in the function of death and regenera
tion is the toad (see below), but she often takes the shape of a fish, snake,
hedgehog, sow, mare, dog, magpie, swallow, quail, moth, or butterfly. Early
in the spring, Ragana appears in brooks or lakes as a beautiful nude woman,
combing her golden hair.
Žverūna
Thirteenth-century records describe the goddess Žverūna (from žvėris,
“wild animal”) .11 She is said to be a dog. Žverūna seems to parallel the
Greek Hekate, who also has a dog epiphany. Both must have been related
to the ancient image of the “lady of the beasts,”who holds geese or is flanked
by wild animals. Later sources confirm that Žverūna is the same as Ragana,
because the names Ragana or Ragaina are often substituted for Žverūna.
Baba Yaga
A similar goddess is Baba Yaga, known in Russian folklore as a witch
and an ogress. But she is the ancient Slavic goddess of death and regen
eration. In Slavic folktales (mainly Russian), Baba Yaga lives in nocturnal
darkness, deep in the woods, far from the world of men. Folktales incon
sistently depict her as an evil old hag who eats humans, especially chil
dren, and as a wise, prophetic old woman. She is tall, bony-legged, and
pestle-headed in appearance, with a long nose and disheveled hair. The
bird is her primary animal image, but she can turn instantly into a frog,
toad, turtle, mouse, crab, vixen, bee, mare, goat, or inanimate object. Baba
Yaga never talks; she either flies in a fiery mortar or lies in her hut: on top
of the oven, on a bench, on the floor, or stretched from one end of the
hut to the other. The hut, supported on bird legs and able to turn on its
axis like a spindle, is, in fact, Baba Yaga herself.
Linguistic analysis of Baba Yaga’s compound name reveals prehistoric
characteristics. Yaga, from Proto-Slavic *(y)ega, means “disease,” “fright,”
and “wrath,” in Old Russian, Serbo-Croatian, and Slovene, respectively.12
206 / The Baltic Religion



It correlates with the Lithuanian verb engti (“strangle, press, torture”). The
early form may be borrowed from Proto-Samoyed *nga, meaning “god,”
or “god or goddess of death.”The Slavic etymon baba means “grandmother,”
“woman,” “cloud woman” (a mythic being who produces rain), and “pel
ican.” The last points to Baba Yaga’s avian nature, comparable to that of
the archetypal vulture and owl goddess of European prehistory, who per
sonifies death and regeneration. In Russian tales, Baba Yaga eats humans
by pecking like a bird (Shapiro 1983). In East Slavic areas, Baba Yaga has
a male counterpart, Koshchei Bessmertnyi, “Koshchei the Immortal.” His
name, from kost’ (“bone”), evokes the notion of a dying and rising god:
that is, a deity who cyclically dies and is reborn. In tales where Koshchei
appears, Baba Yaga is either his mother or his aunt.
Rupūžė, the Toad
To this century, the toad (rupūžė in Lithuanian) is as prominent as Ragana
in beliefs concerning death, healing, and regeneration. Her name is often
used as a swearword. As omen of death, the toad recalls the white lady
(Giltinė) and the birds of prey. If a toad (or frog) croaks in a farmer’s house,
someone will die. If, in the spring, a toad jumps in front of you on the
road, then you will die. (See also Gimbutas 1 9 8 9 ,2 5 6 .) However, the toad
can be a healer. If one finds a toad, dead or alive, and places it on a sore,
it may help heal it. The drink made of toad and vodka, rupūžinė, is a
panacea, and it is widely used in Lithuania today.13 Sometimes, a live toad
was attached to the neck of a cancer patient and carried, dead or alive,
until the cancer disappeared.
Lauma
Latvian Lauma (Lithuanian Laumė), a fairy, is Ragana’s earthly exten
sion. She rises from expanses of water at night, singly, in threes, or in a
large group. She is a sexually attractive woman with superhuman char
acteristics. Often she is a bird; she looks like a woman with long hair and
pendulous breasts but has bird feet or even a hen’s body. Lauma may also
change into a goat or a mare. At night, Lauma may work all sorts of mis
chief: she shears too much wool from sheep, milks cows dry, rides horses
and wears them out. However, she is not entirely evil: she sometimes does
good work. But her goodness is conditional and may immediately turn
into a threat of destruction and death. Multiple Laumas come in groups
in the evenings, bringing their spinning wheels, particularly on Thursday
nights. They spin very rapidly and are likely to spin everything in sight,
once they have finished with flax, tow, and wool. They may seize the moss
and fiber used to stuff chinks in the walls, the hair of women, and even
human intestines or veins.
207 / The Baltic Religion



About a quarter of all stories dealing with Laumas describe their rela
tions with men. Like Raganas, they dominate men sexually They can
exhaust men until the men drop dead, or they can tickle men to death.
If a man should accost a Lauma, annoy her, or make fun of her, she pur
sues him to his detriment. Lauma’s physical appearance vividly reflects
her Paleolithic origins. She has bird feet and a bird body combined with
a woman’s breasts. Her sexual superiority and manifestations in threes
and in groups clearly stem from the pre-Indo-European social order. Anal
ogous beings found in other European cultures include south Slavic Vilas
(Vily), Russian Rusalki, Polish Boginki, Basque Laminak, and Greek
Lamias.14
EARTH POWER
The second group of Baltic goddesses and gods of Old European origin
manifests both wild and cultivated nature, and the fertility of crops, ani
mals, and humans. The main divinity is Lithuanian Žemyna (Latvian Žemes
Mate). Her name comes from žeme, žeme, “earth.” She personifies Mother
Earth: moist, fertile, black (the color of the fertile earth), and strong. This
goddess has close parallels with the Greek Gaia-Demeter, Thracian Semele,
Roman Ops Consiva, Slavic Mat’ Syra Zemlya, “Mother Moist Earth.” Her
counterparts include incarnations and guardians of wild nature (male and
female), dying and resurrecting male deities, and the subterranean man
ikins: the Kaukai. These amazingly archaic creatures are the manifesta
tions of earth life itself, located between death and birth. They have their
patron god Puškaitis, god of the elder bushes, who breathes and exhales
earth life force in the form of foul smells.
Žemyna
The functions of the goddess Žemyna concern fertility and multipli
cation. She creates life out of herself, performing the miracle of renewal.
This act accords with the Old European belief that seasonal awakening,
growing, fattening, and dying were interdependent among humans, ani
mals, and plants. As indicated by ritual practices, her veneration contin
ued to this century. From late-seventeenth-century sources (as described
by Praetorius in Lithuania Minor in 1690), we hear that a black suckling
pig was offered to Žemyna (as it was to Demeter in Greece) during the
harvest feast presided over by a priestess. Offerings to her are of the utmost
importance: grave consequences are expected if offerings— bread, ale, and
black animals or birds— are not made at regular intervals. In such a case,
as recorded in 1582 in eastern Lithuania, a family member or an animal
of the household may be paralyzed, or a huge snake will obstruct the
208 / The Baltic Religion



entrance to the house. Offerings of bread to Žemyna continued through
the early twentieth century. A loaf or piece of bread was left in a rye, wheat,
or barley field at the first spring plowing to ensure a fertile year, or at har
vest’s end to secure abundance for the next year. At the end of harvest,
the mowers had to find the bread and circle it three times. Then they ate
a piece and buried the rest in the ground.
The earth mother was worshiped on mountain summits crowned with
large stones. The summit stone represents the omphalos, a concentrated
power center of the earth.15 The earth mother was similarly worshiped in
many ancient cultures throughout Europe. In Brittany, she became a hill
topped with an omphalos, illustrated by passage graves in Brittany (see
Fig. 52a-c, above). In Crete, the British Isles, and the eastern Baltic area
she was also the sacred mountain.16 A large stone crowns the sacred hill
of Rambynas on the bank of the Nemunas River in western Lithuania. It
has been considered sacred at least since the fourteenth century. A
sixteenth-century source conveys that women coming to Rambynas seek
ing fertility should be very clean. Even in the nineteenth century, newly
wed couples seeking fertility at home and good crops in the field made
offerings there. Those stones of the earth mother are not upright pillars,
but large and flat. In Germany and the Scandinavian countries, flat stones
with polished surfaces are widely known as Brautsteine, or bridestones.
Young brides visited these stones to sit on them or crawl over them, seek
ing fertility. In Rome, large stones with flat surfaces dedicated to Ops Con
siva, the Roman goddess of earth fertility, were kept in holes in the ground
(sub terra) and covered with straw. They were uncovered only once a year
during the harvest feast. About fifteen hundred years later, Jesuit annals
recorded the same tradition in Lithuania. In a .d . 1600, they described large
stones with flat surfaces dug into the earth and covered with straw: they
were called deivės, “goddesses.” Thus, we learn that the stone is the god
dess herself.
Earth is justice, the social conscience, as represented by the Greek
Themis, Russian Mat’ Syra Zemlya, and Lithuanian Žemyna. The wide dis
tribution of this concept reveals its prehistoric roots. The earth mother
listens to appeals, settles problems, punishes all who deceive or disrespect
her. She does not tolerate thieves, liars, or vain or proud people. In leg
ends and tales, sinners are devoured by the earth, along with their houses
or castles; the earth closes over them, and a lake or mountain appears on
the site. For centuries peasants settled legal disputes relating to landed
property by calling on the earth as witness. If someone swore an oath after
placing a clod of earth on his head or swallowing it, that oath was con
sidered binding and incontestable.
209 / The Baltic Religion



Medeina: Goddess o f the Forests
Although few records described Medeina (Lithuanian Medeinė), they
recognized that she was related to the Greek Artemis and Roman Diana.
Actually, fifteenth-century records call her Diana, guardian of forests. She
first appeared in the Russian chronicles of Hypatius, in the thirteenth cen
tury a .d . Her name derives from medis, “tree,” and medė, “forest.” In early
historical times, as well as in prehistory, she was a prominent goddess of
forests, perhaps an incarnation of the powers or fecundity of wild nature.
Her sacred animal was a hare, an animal also special to Artemis and Diana.
Folk beliefs relate that this alert, quick little animal helped the goddess to
protect her forests, especially by leading hunters astray. The sight of a hare
in Medeina’s forests created fear. Even the Lithuanian king Mindaugas (who
lived in the thirteenth century a .d .) would not hunt in the forest if he saw
Medeina’s hare. Clearly, the animal was sacred, a double of the goddess.
One nineteenth-century folktale from northern Lithuania speaks of “the
lady of the forests” dressed in silk, living in a huge mansion and assisted
by strong young priestesses.17 At their mansion, they kept a bull whom
each of the young girls struck with a rod upon entering the house. When
the last and the most beautiful of the priestesses arrived, she hit the bull
with such force that the animal died. The peculiar ritual of killing the bull
may represent a memory of bull sacrifice, the taurobolium. The bull was
the primary animal sacrificed to Artemis and Kybele, in order to ensure
the rebirth of nature.
Vaižgantas: Dying and Resurrecting Flax God
The god Vaižgantas appears in the form of flax from the earth. He is
tortured, dies, stays in the earth as seed, and is reborn. The sixteenth
century text of Lasicius records the following prayer to him: “Vaižgantas,. . .
don’t let us go naked.” Lasicius also speaks of certain rituals to Vaižgan
tas performed during the feast of the dead, Ilgės: a girl climbs on a chair
with an apron full of cakes, which she holds in her left hand. In her right
hand is the bark of a linden tree. Standing on one foot, she invokes the
god, asking him to make the flax grow as tall as she is now and so plen
tiful that she could totally cover herself with flax (Mannhardt 1936, 532).
Thus, Vaižgantas is not only the god of flax in the narrow sense, but also
the one who “clothes naked people.” Vaižgantas also symbolizes the gen
eral renewal of vegetation, specifically related to flax. In sources dating to
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Vaižgantas is mentioned as “god
of women and libertines,” comparable to the Greek Dionysus, who was
known as the “god of women.” The Greek flax god, Linos, closely paral
lels Vaižgantas, which suggests a common origin for both the southern
210 / The Baltic Religion



and northern European flax gods in an early agricultural period. Linos is
the dying god, similar to the Mesopotamian Dumuzi-Tammuz, described in greater detail in chapter 8.
The name Vaižgantas is a compound, the first part of which, vaisd, is
“fruitfulness,” or “reproduction.” In Praetorius’ description of Lithuanian
paganism in Prussia at the end of the seventeenth century, Vaižgantas is
called “god of fertility,” to whom a lamb and a rooster are sacrificed (ibid.).
Although the sources are scanty for a full reconstruction of Vaižgantas’
image, we can sense this god’s rich dimensions: he was not only a sor
rowful god destined to die; he was also a blossoming young god who influ
enced plant growth and the marriage of girls.
Kaukai: Manifestations o f Earth Power in the Cycle o f Death and Life
In Lithuanian children’s books, Kaukai appear as bearded gnomes. But
they are far more than gnomes: they are little creatures the size of a human
head who look more like tadpoles than humans. Sixteenth- and seventeenth
century records described them as “little men who eat vegetarian food.” To
this day they are believed to help people by increasing grain and hay.
Lexical evidence substantiates the chthonian origin of kaukas (sg.)
(Greimas 1 9 7 9 ,3 6 ff.; 1992 in English translation). Numerous words stem
from the root kauk-: kdukolas, kaukolis, and kaukuolys, which denote a dry
or frozen clod or lump of earth. Through analogy, we can see this imagery
in representations of kaukas: for example, “a kaukas is as big as two fists,
round like a ball.”18
Additional words make direct reference to Kaukas. Kaūkas, kaukelis, or
kaukoras is a name for a certain type of aromatic root, Mandragora offici
narum. “Kaukas’ comb”is a name for a plant shaped like a hand. This plant
possesses magical powers and has connections with the underworld:
“Comb your hair with it, and make sure that not a single piece breaks
off— you will then have knowledge of all that is hidden in the earth.”19
Kaukai make their abode underground. Housewives often make a loose
garment from a single thread and bury it in a comer of their house in order
to entice a Kaukas to dwell there. Since the Kaukai are earth-born, they
live in basements or dark storehouses.
Before humans and Kaukai made an agreement, Kaukai lived in the
forest. Lexical evidence sheds some light on this arrangement. For exam
ple, many words that have the root kauk- relate to mushrooms: kauka
grybis (grybas = mushroom) refers to a whole group of mushrooms, Phallus
impudicus; kaukatiltis (tiltas = bridge) represents a place where many mush
rooms can be found; kaukoratis (ratas = circle or wheel) is a cluster of mush
rooms. There is a saying: “Don’t light any fires on kaukoratis, because
Kaukeliai (diminutive of Kaūkas) might come there at night.”
211 / The Baltic Religion



Kaukai accept only vegetarian food, and they give only earth’s prod
ucts. They increase wheat and rye (this is connected with their bread eat
ing) and hay (this is connected with their milk drinking). The Kaukai never
bring money.
If a Kaukas leaves you a single straw of hay on a few kernels of grain,
never-ending fortune will be yours. A Kaukas does not bring material for
tune, but symbolic increase (Lithuanian skalsa), which imbues objects with
a mythical abundance so that they seem inexhaustible. Kaukai are believed
to increase property. The expression “Kaukas yra skalsos” (“Kaukas is
increase”) implies that the Kaukas himself embodies the idea of infinite
material supply.
Various written sources mention bezdukai, or barstukai, another name
for Kaukai. Their patron divinity is the god Puškaitis, who lives under the
elder bush. Praetorius explains that this tree or bush was also called bez
das. These facts help explain why bezdukas describes the forest-dwelling
Kaukas. He lives in or near an elder bush and smells characteristically foul.
A certain rank root plant also called kaukas provides further evidence
regarding the Kaukas olfactory association. As Greimas has shown, the
root for the god Puškaitis is pusk-, and it may belong to the same word
group that includes the verb pūškuoti, “to exhale, to breathe heavily.” This
kind of etymology discloses that the god Puškaitis embodies the earth
and, by alternately breathing deeply and spreading odors with the help of
bezdai (elder trees), gives birth to chthonic beings: bezdukai and Kaukai.
The name Kaukas relates not only to roots, mushrooms, and dirt clods
but also to “glands” (kaukos) and a “boil” (kaukas). The boil is round, soft,
and damp, which connects it to the spheroid form of the Kaukas (Greimas
1979, 51). A further explanation of the origin of the name allies it with
the boar, an animal that the Old Europeans associated with death. Kaukai
can be hatched from a boar’s testicles. One must slaughter a seven-year
old boar, cut off his testicles, and hatch them, keeping them in either a
warm place or a hole in the wooden post of the porch doorway. The new
born Kaukas announces his hatching by rapping and tapping. The wooden
porch doors represent the passage from the “natural” exterior to the “cul
tural” interior, from forest to house. “Boar” in Lithuanian is kuilys, derived
from kuila, a rupture or hernia.
Kaukas has further linguistic associations with “skull” (kaukolė), and
“head, mask” (kaukė). The name for skull (kaukolė), in addition to the
Kaukas’ head- or skull-sized dimensions and his embryonic, glandular
form, place the Kaukai in the time between death and birth. They tem
porarily rise to the surface and affect human life, then return to their pre
birth state underground, where they belong. Jan Lasicius, in the late
212 / The Baltic Religion



sixteenth century, described Kaukai as “souls of the dead” (‘‘kaukie sunt
lemures” [Lasicius 1969, 44]).
A common belief, originally Old European, maintains that the skull
contains the life principle; therefore, people often cared for and buried
the skull separately. The association of Kaukai with the skull and the head
as the soul’s abode, their association with roots and mushrooms, and their
glandular, embryonic appearance leave little doubt about the essence of
these chthonic beings. The Kaukas is a creature about to be bom , yet
unborn, belonging to an intermediary realm between death and birth. This
sacred time of the earth’s pregnancy is imbued with mysterious energies
that may manifest themselves aboveground as Kaukai, bringing ever
increasing material goods. Kaukai, with their patron god, Puškaitis, reveal
the earth’s constant cyclical energy as the forest’s “breathing power.”
Conclusions
We can see that the Baltic pantheon remarkably preserves an almost com
plete Old European family of goddesses and gods. Neither the presence
of the Indo-Europeans nor the five centuries of intensive war between
paganism and Christianity exterminated the oldest layer of Baltic beliefs.
Best preserved are the goddesses, who were life and birth givers, healers,
protectresses of households and communities, bringers of earth fertility,
death messengers, and life regenerators. Until recently, people kissed
Mother Earth as if she were a human mother, in the morning and in the
evening, before Christian prayers were said. You could kiss Mother Earth;
you could see Laima in an anthropomorphic form or in any animal man
ifestation; you could touch the goddess as a stone, or hear her as a cuckoo.
You could sense the death goddess Giltinė’s approach as a sliding snake
or see her in human shape standing at the head of a sick person. Until
very recently, the goddess was a living entity. She diminished only in the
mid-twentieth century, with the infiltration of technology and political
upheavals. Sadly, many residues of past ages were wiped out rather sud
denly. Virgin Mary partially replaced Laima and Žemyna and continued
to be passionately worshiped as a savior of fallen humanity. In May, she
is still showered with flowers. In August, she is expected to bless the har
vest. Ragana still exists as a witch; her name is a curse word, as is the name
for her main incarnation, Rupūžė, “the toad.” The snake, the symbol of life
energy for millennia, has finally vanished from homes and house foun
dations. The Lithuanian sorrowful god— the old vegetation god— still sits
calmly supporting his chin with his hand at farmsteads, in forests, along
roads, or in chapels, wondering if regeneration is still possible.

EDITOR’S AFTERWORD
arija Gimbutas concluded this, her final book, with the goddesses,
gods, and spirits of the Balts. It is perhaps fitting that she ended
this book with a long section on Lithuanian folklore, since it was the Baltic
goddesses, particularly the Latvian and the Lithuanian, with whom she
had felt a kinship since her childhood. Throughout her life, her native
country, its folklore, language, and customs, remained foremost in her heart.
When she was a child, she learned of the Lithuanian goddesses, gods,
and spirits honored even in the early part of the twentieth century. These
deities peopled the landscape of her spirit, enriching her love for the land,
waters, flowers, trees. Marija Gimbutas was an ecologist decades before
the word became popularized, and her home in the hills of Topanga, Cal
ifornia, reflected her love of nature. This love became a foundation stone
in her own philosophy of life and her personal spirituality.
In her last decade of life, Marija Gimbutas’ own ecological and spiri
tual beliefs found resonance in the growing spiritual and ecological move
ments in the United States and abroad. Her books, as well as her presence,
became a strong focus in ecological movements— so much so that many
people, perhaps without intending to, learned quite a bit of archaeology.
Marija Gimbutas’ philosophies— describing a world where men and women
might live in harmony with one another and with their environment
found a home in the hearts of thousands of people, helping to shape the
ideas of a new generation of ecologists. Women and men in the fields of
ecological science, anthropology, folklore, and mythology, as well as
archaeology, have been touched and transformed by the works of Marija
Gimbutas.

E D I T O R ’S NOTES
Chapter One / Images o f Goddesses and Gods
1 . This is a common theme in Marija Gimbutas’work, misunderstood by many, who assert that she advocated a single unidimensional deity for both the Euro pean Upper Paleolithic and the Neolithic, a “fertility” or “mother” goddess. For an excellent explication of the various functions and manifestations of ancient female figures, see Rice (1981); Rice contends that what are called Upper Paleolithic Venus figures are really figures of women of all ages, from young women to pregnant women to old women. 2. Artifacts found in this cave date to the seventh millennium b.c. See BarYosef (1985,15). According to the author, the cave must have been used as a store for cult objects in a Neolithic ritual. 3. See Barber (1994, Figs. 2.1, 2.5, 2.8). 4. In Ireland, holy wells are still visited and honored. See Brenneman and Brenneman (1995). 5. In the festival of Brauronian Artemis, a female celebrant, wearing a yellow robe, would portray Artemis as a bear. See Dexter (1980, 26). 6. This is not true hibernation: although in winter the bear lives off of the fat that it stored in summer and autumn, its body temperature remains high and it leaves its den and walks on mild days. 7. Further, birds were able to fly freely through the air, between earth and heaven; since they could thus communicate with the heavens, they were perhaps therefore identified with those deities who inhabited the heavens. 8. The Sesklo culture flourished c. 6 500-5500 b.c. in Thessaly and southern Macedonia. The Dimini culture flourished c. 5500 -4 0 0 0 b.c. in Thessaly. 9. These are Sumerian texts. 10. This site was located on the eastern Mediterranean coast. 11. See Leick (1994, 150-51) for another viewpoint. 12. According to Mircea Eliade (1954; 1991, 52), among all cultures there is the concept of the periodic regeneration of life, at least on the cosmological level, presupposing a repetition of the cosmogonic act. Life, and time itself, are cycli cally regenerated. 13. Although this figure does not exhibit all of the features that one recog nizes in more classical Gorgons, its wide mouth and lolling tongue are hallmarks of the “death goddess” that later became the Gorgon. 14. In other representations Medusa is winged. She is both bird and snake, and she thus represents both death and the promise of regeneration. See Dexter in Dexter and Polomé, eds. (1997, 124-54). 15. See Apollodorus, B ibliotheca, III.x:3. 16. Bau/Baba was the city goddess of Lagash. She bore septuplet daughters, the clouds, to her husband Ningirsu. Lubell (1994) discusses Baubo and similar goddesses. Marija Gimbutas wrote the foreword to this book.
217



17. For iconography of Baubo and Isis-Baubo displaying her vulva, see Lubell (1994): Figs. 1.4 (from Alexandria, Egypt), 8 .2 -3 (from Priene, Asia Minor), 9.2-3 (from Alexandria, Egypt), and 9.4 (from southern Italy). 18. These could be related to Lithuanian boba, an old woman or wife, and bobausis, an edible fungus. 19. See Reynold Higgins, M in o a n a n d M y c en a e a n A rt (London: Thames and Hudson, 1967), 52, Fig. 50. The scene takes place on a gold signet ring made between 1700 and 1550 b.c. According to the author, the hoop is too small for the ring to have been worn on the finger. Thus, one would presume religious or ritual significance. 20. See Walberg (1986, 104), Figs. 122 and 123, where she-goats nurse their young. 21. The warrior god was represented by a bull in other ancient patriarchal reli gions as well; for example, the Semitic Ugaritic peoples of northern Syria called one of their gods “bull El”: tr il (cf. Cyrus Gordon, U garitic M a n u a l, “Hymn to Anat” Pi. X.v.22 et passim). We should be aware, however, that the cow, the she-goat, and the sheep are powerful epiphanies of the female deity. Thus both Hathor and Hera are given cow imagery and epithets, while sheep are regularly associated with the great-goddess: for example, the Iranian Anahita. Thus we must not too read ily assign male gender to homed bovines. Carol P Christ (personal communica tion) believes that the connection between cows’ horns and the uterus is more likely than a connection between bulls’ horns and the uterus. 22. See Cameron (1981). 23. This goddess maybe associated with the winter sun. See Monaghan (1994, 23 2 -4 4 ) on the Gorgon Medusa and the sun. 24. This concluding section has been written by the editor in order to main tain consistency, since Marija Gimbutas had written conclusions only to some of the chapters by the time of her death. Since her conclusions frequently take the form of summaries, this section is a summary as well. 25. This script is well evidenced on the Vinca and other Balkan figurines (described in this chapter and more thoroughly in chapter 2). It is also evidenced, and has been the subject of some controversy, at the French site of Glozel. See Biaggi et al. (1994).
Chapter Two / Symbols, Signs, and Sacred Script
1. This system may have been similar to Sumerian. In Sumerian, the earliest form of writing, sentences are not always syntactically complete; some sentences seem to follow a set of rules; others, missing various elements, seem to be a sort of shorthand. But we have no way of knowing if Old European writing too may have represented sentences, complete or otherwise. The Old European writing system may have been ideographic: its symbols may have indicated whole words or even concepts. 2. The term e x voto is Latin, meaning “from a vow,” an object given in fulfill ment of a pledge to a deity. 3. See Roska (1941) for the text used by Marija Gimbutas. Also see Zsofia Torma (1894). 4. Old Persian was an ancient Indo-European language, similar in many ways to the ancient Indie language Sanskrit; Akkadian and Babylonian were
218 / Editor’s Notes to Pages 2 8 - 5 1



Semitic languages; and both Sumerian and Elamite have no known linguistic affiliations. 5. However, the Old European languages remained as “substrates” of the new Indo-European languages, affecting the new languages in many ways, including the phonology, or individual sounds, of the language and the vocabulary as well. See Huld (1 9 9 0 ,3 8 9 -4 2 3 ), who gives evidence for an Old European S p ra ch b u n d , a collection of languages that share similar phonological and other patterns, par ticularly an initial b, open syllables, and gemination of stops. See also Polome (1990, 331-3 8 ) on prehistoric northern European substrate words for plants, animals, and activities characteristic of Neolithic cultures. 6. For a discussion of the different Minoan scripts, see Packard (1974). 7. Marija Gimbutas read the unpublished form of the latter of Haarmann’s books in manuscript. 8. In archaeological terminology, “pre-Indo-European”refers to indigenous peo ples occupying areas to which the Indo-Europeans migrated. Thus, they were peo
ples who lived in areas b efo re the a d v en t o f the In d o -E u ro p ea n s. However, in
linguistic terminology, the term “pre-lndo- European”or “Pre-Indo-European”refers to the form of the Indo-European language preceding the Proto-phase: thus, it means a v ery ea rly p h a s e o f I n d o -E u ro p ea n . Marija Gimbutas uses the term in its archaeological sense. 9. This concluding section was added by the editor.
Chapter Three / The Tomb and the Womb
1. For a discussion of the Mnajdra megaliths, see chapter 4. 2. We may think of the Sumerian goddess Ereshkigal, queen of the underworld and the dead, who in the “Descent of Inanna” is in the process of giving birth. 3. Carol P Christ (personal communication) reminds us that, alternatively, there may have been a second burial some years after the first, as in contemporary Greece. 4. Again, an alternative notion is that they may have undergone a previous burial. 5. An alternative theory is that the antlers were retrieved without sacrificing the deer. 6. Most of the female figurines and statues found in Malta are large-bodied, with distinctively heavy arms and legs. 7. Skulls were often buried separately from the other bones ofthe skeleton. They have been found stacked along the walls of a tomb; sometimes the skull, hands, or feet are missing from a burial. At other times, skulls have been found in a special area of the cemetery, separated from the other skeletal bones and buried along with the skulls and jaws of animals: deer, ox, goat, and pig. See Gimbutas 1991, 283. 8. It is a tribute to the engineering abilities of these people that “the sun has shone [into] the chamber ever since the date of its construction and will proba bly continue to do so for ever [sic], regardless of secular changes in the obliquity of the ecliptic.” See Jon Patrick in O’ Kelly (1982, 124). Thus the phenomenon has endured for more than five thousand years. 9. There is no general agreement on the interpretation of Megalithic art. Numer ous alternate interpretations have been advanced. See O’Sullivan (1986) for a brief survey and bibliography of the various approaches, including his own. 10. This concluding section was added by the editor.

Chapter Four / Temples
1 . 1 have been unable to find this article. 2. According to Carol E Christ (personal communication), “The creation of pottery from clay and fire, bread from wheat, water and fire, and cloth from flax or wool were no doubt viewed as transformative mysteries, analogous to and gov erned by the goddess’ transformative power.” 3. This town, on the west side of the Urals, is on the Volga River. 4. Mehmet Ozdogan pointed out to Joan Marler, the editor of Marija Gimbutas’ C ivilization o f the G oddess, that the anthropomorphic vessel was actually a grain storage container (Marler, personal communication). 5. Moldavia is the Soviet name; the post-Soviet name is Moldova. 6. However, there are scholars who believe that there was no hierarchy in Old Europe. See Christ (1997, 59). 7. The chair has great significance in ancient iconography. It represents the goddess herself (for example, the Egyptian Isis was the throne, as her hieroglyph demonstrates). By sitting in the chair, a mortal was invested with the power of the goddess, thereby receiving the right to rule. The birthing stool, by playing an impor tant role in childbirth, would have participated in the sacrality both of the throne and of birth and regeneration. 8. Barber (1994) discusses string skirts evidenced from Upper Paleolithic arti facts through contemporary folk costumes; she believes that these skirts were asso ciated with— and therefore an icon of— childbearing. 9. Although these figures are without breasts, they are identified as female by many archaeologists because they are steatopygous: that is, they have character istic accumulations of fat on the buttocks. See Gimbutas (1989,163) on steatopy gous Upper Paleolithic female figurines. She believed that the steatopygia was a “metaphor for the double egg or pregnant belly: intensified fertility.”Also see Ma lone et al. (1993, 81), who state that the figures found in the Maltese site of Tarxien, dating to c. 2800 b.c., were “almost certainly female because of the distinctive accumulation of fat on the buttocks.” The authors believe that the female figures have an underworld, rather than a fertility, aspect; see also Trump (1972, 25).
Chapter Five / Sacred Stone and Wood Ceremonial Centers
1. Although the earlier stages of the roundels, such as that represented at Bucany, did not contain settlements, there is evidence that in the Lengyel II culture of Slo vakia (c. 44 0 0 -4 2 0 0 b.c., calibrated dates), at the Zlkovce site, there was indeed a settlement associated with a palisade fortification. Perhaps because of climatic changes, there are no known fortifications dating from the Lengyel 111 or IV stages. See Pavuk (1991). 2. See Burl (1979, 190). Further, a dwarflike woman, her head aligned to the south, was buried in the middle of a group of small sarsens in the southern part of Avebury henge, and very large sarsen slabs were placed over her. See Burl (1979,66). 3. See Burl (1979, 197-98). 4. The Avebury complex has not been fully excavated, although there are plans to continue excavation in the near future. Many of the megalithic stones of Ave bury were discovered buried within the henge, and it is assumed that the new excavations will unearth many more megalithic stones.

5. Stonehenge 1 dates from c. 3100 to c. 2300 b.c.; Stonehenge 11 lasted from c. 2150 to c. 2000 b.c.; Stonehenge 111, in several phases, dates from c. 2100 to c. 1100 B.c.; and Stonehenge IV dates to 1100 B.c. See Chippindale (1983,267-71).
Chapter Six / Matrilineal Social Structure
1. See Madsen (1 9 8 8 ,3 0 1 -3 6 ). According to Madsen, the period in which the causewayed enclosures were built coincides with the period of concentrated tomb building: both date from c. 2 700-2450 B.c. (these are uncalibrated dates). Fol lowing calibrated dating ofAndersen (1 9 8 8 ,3 37 ,3 5 4 ) and Gimbutas (1991,138), we may postulate calibrated dates of c. 3400 -3 2 0 0 B.c. 2. On environmental factors in the spatial distributions of cairns, see David son in C. Renfrew (1979, 16-20); on “sacred space” in the disposition of Orca dian cairns, see C. Renfrew (1979, 215 ff.). 3. On burial practices of the patriarchal Indo-Europeans, seeJones-Bley (1997, 194-221). Jones-Bley analyzes the eight elements that, according to Marija Gimbutas (1974a, 2 9 3-94), identify an Indo-European burial. 4. To the Irish Celtic tradition of the sovereignty goddess Flaith, and the epic heroine Queen Medb, we may compare the Indie goddess Šri Lakshmi in her par ticular role as raja-lakshm l, “kingly fortune”; without her the king cannot remain sovereign. 5. Another opinion is offered by Morris (1989, 511-35), who interprets the frescoes as a pictorial narrative “transforming history into art,” including generic landscapes and motifs that complement the literary epics of Homer as well as ear lier epic poetry that she believes was in existence in the early Mycenaean period, c. 1500 b.c. Thus the frescoes would tell of scenes of battle, council, and arrival and departure by sea, juxtaposed to scenes of everyday, peaceful life among peo ples about to be besieged. 6. Thus, although we cannot be certain of an Old European hieros gam os, there is great evidence for the myth of the hieros gam os in most early historical (and early patriarchal) European and Near Eastern cultures. 7. The custom of the avunculate was preserved in both matrilineal and patri lineal societies. 8. The fact that the Spartan men were often away from home, at war, must have contributed to the autonomy of the Spartan women, who of necessity occu pied a very public role in society— unlike their Athenian sisters. 9. Strabo, G eo gra p h y 3.4.18. The Greek word used actually is gy n a co cra cy : ywcuKOKpariav. The people referred to in the passage are the Cantabrians, an Iber ian subgroup. 10. Another possibility is that succession among the ancient Celts was matripatrilineal. See Dexter 1997a. 11. Diodorus Siculus, B ibliothecae, V:32.2 ff. 12. Dio Cassius, R o m a n History, Epitome of Book, LXII2:3-4. Marija Gimbu tas takes the translation from James E. Doan, W o m en a n d G o d desses in E a rly Celtic History, M yth, a n d L eg en d , 20. In Indo-European tripartite symbolism, red is the color of the warrior class. 13. For example, Procopius, in the H istory o f the W ars (VIII:20.20), tells us of Hermigisil, king of the Saxon Varini, who, on his deathbed, ordered his son Radigis to marry his stepmother, the queen: “Let my son Radigis be married to his step
221 / Editor’s Notes to Pages 1 0 5 - 1 2 4



mother henceforth, just as the law of our forefathers decrees.” Similarly, Canute the Dane overthrew Ethelred and then married his queen.
Part II / The Living Goddesses
1. Marija Gimbutas had recently begun using the term gy n o cen tric, “womancentered.” This is not a universally accepted term, but one she used to attempt to convey an idea still in flux. 2. Marija Gimbutas did not include a section on Roman religion, preferring that her attention to Italy be focused on the Etruscans and their religion.
Chapter Seven / The Minoan Religion in Crete
1. Marija Gimbutas refers here to prehistoric cultures such as that of Catal Huyuk, which she discusses in the early chapters. 2. On pre-Indo-European place-names, see Haley (1928, 141-45), with map; and Blegen (1928, 145-54); both include a review of the literature. The authors cite names ending in nthos and assos as part of an Aegean-Anatolian substratum borrowed by Greek. Haley identifies a movement from Asia Minor to Greece, and Blegen, citing archaeological evidence, hypothesizes that these pre-Greek placenames are to be associated with the early Bronze Age. See Gimbutas (1991, 388) for dates: c. 2 900-2250 b .c . 3. On Cretan cave sanctuaries, see Christ (1995). 4. Marinatos (1993, 114) believes that the ritual implements may have belonged to a temple official, who could have been the owner of the house; thus the implements need not point to a sacrifice committed within the building. Con sequently, all four people may have died when the earthquake caused the build ing to collapse. 5. There has been some disagreement whether the white color is an adequate indicator of gender in Minoan Crete; Nanno Marinatos argues that both the redbrown-colored (sometimes termed “black”) and the white-colored bull leapers are male, citing both their anatomy and their ritual dress, which includes a codpiece with phallus sheath (1993, 218-20). 6. The Linear B syllabary did not indicate aspirated consonants such as th, so a-ta -n a can indicate Athana, classical Greek Athena. 7. This large, beaky nose is a characteristic of the Neolithic bird goddess. 8. Hesiod, T h eo gony 9 4 7 -4 8 ; Apollodorus, E p ito m e 1.8. 9. Homer, O dyssey V: 125-26; Hesiod, T h eo gony 969 -7 1 . 10. On fourth-century coins of the Cretan city, Phaistos, Zeus Velchanos (EeAxavo?) is depicted sitting on a stump holding a rooster; his form is very youth ful, similar to that of the classical Dionysus. See Famell (1896-1909,1:109). 11. Although this etymology seems rational, there is one difficulty: the uncom pounded word da, de, “earth” has not been securely attested. See Chantraine (1966-70,11:272-73). 12. At Mesara, Mochlos, Archanes, and other places, graves were periodically cleansed and fumigated; then parts of the skeleton were reburied. This is known as secondary burial. In the case of secondary burial, only certain bones, such as the skulls and femurs, were kept; others were discarded. Secondary burial is still practiced in Greece. See Marinatos (1993, 2 2 -2 3 , 26-27).
222 / Editor’s Notes to Pages 1 2 9 - 1 4 6



13. Such secondary burials in sarcophagi, or la m a k es, were found in the ceme tery of Phoumi at Archanes in central Crete. See Marinatos (1993, 22). 14. In Egypt, this pair of goddesses is represented by the sisters Isis and Nephthys, who both protect the dead and nurse the living. 15. We should keep in mind that this sarcophagus dates to the Mycenaean era. Thus, it may not depict Minoan rites at all. 16. The dating of the Theran eruption is very recent; see Sinclair Hood (1996); archaeologists arrived at the date through radiocarbon dating calibrated with tree ring analysis. Hood, in his earlier work (1971, 147) gives c. 1500 b.c.; Marinatos (1993,4) also dates the eruption at 1500 B.c. For another opinion see Renfrew (1996). 17. The preceding part of the conclusions was added by the editor.
Chapter Eight / The Greek Religion
1. This introduction was added by the editor. 2. For a brief comparison of Indo-European and Old European burial rites, see Jones-Bley (1990). 3. Greek religion is particularly imbued with influences from the Near East. In fact, several Greek deities and heroic figures seem to be descendants of Near Eastern figures. The Greek hero Herakles, for example, has inherited both the cloth ing and several labors from the Mesopotamian Gilgamesh, while the Greek god dess Aphrodite is a descendant of the Sumerian-Akkadian Inanna-Ishtar (West Semitic Ashtarte), goddesses of love, war, and several other functions. Although Aphrodite is primarily a love goddess in Greek myth, her warrior function is dis cernible in her mating with Ares (Homer, Odyssey, VIII) and epithets such as the Spartan Aphrodite Areia, “warlike Aphrodite” (Pausanias, D escriptio n o f G reece, 111. 17:5-6). The T heogony of Hesiod, including the “Kingship in Heaven”genealo gies, is particularly traceable to the Near East. External origins for other Greek deities are evident as well: Dionysos, according to many scholars, probably orig inated in Thrace (see Famell 1896-1909, V:85-86). 4. Hekate was often depicted iconographically in triple aspect, facing in three directions. She was the threefold goddess. 5. Porphyry, D e A n t ro N y m p h a ru m , 18. Here, Porphyry was speaking of Kore, a maiden aspect of the goddess. As a personification of youth if not virginity, Kore was similar to the virgin Artemis. 6. Pausanias VIII:37.4, on Arcadia.
7. H o m e ric H y m n 28, to Artemis: E X a fp flo X o v .
8. Pausanias VII: 18, onAchaia. 9. “She [who stands] by the path,” “on the wayside.” This is similar to Roman Tri-via, a common epithet of Hekate, goddess of the crossroads. 10. Porphyry, d e A n tru m N y m p h a ru m 18. Here, Porphyry was citing Sopho cles, from fragment 795 (Nauck), “the swarm of the dead buzzes and rises up,”
B ofxfiel 8e vexpuiv a/urjvas e p ^ e ra t t ’ ava>.
1 1 .Ibid. 12. Both the O xfo rd C lassical D iction ary and Famell (1896-1909,11:481) indi cate that bees may have been of religious significance in the worship of Artemis at Ephesos. Famell (591) cites the E tym ologicu m M a g n u m (1848, 383.30), which gives “The King among the Ephesians”as a definition of “essene,” from a metaphor for the king of the bees, who is called an essene (that is, a drone).
223 / Editor’s Notes to Pages 1 4 7 - 1 5 7



13. Homer, Odyssey, 1:319-20,111:371-72. 14. Homer, Odyssey, 111:371 et passim. The Greek adjective glaukopis may mean either “bright-eyed” or “owl-faced.” 15. According to Sinclair Hood (197 1 ,1 1 2 ), an inscription whose script runs in a spiral, similar to that on the Phaistos disc, was found on a bronze votive ax excavated from “a sacred cave at Arkalokhori.” Hood considers the inscription to be of a religious or magical character. 16. See Della Volpe (in Dexter and Polome 1 9 9 7 ,1 0 3 -2 3 ) on “The Great God dess, the Sirens, and Parthenope.” 17. Thus, the Sirens were not consistently viewed as negative. Carol P. Christ reminds us that Sirens holding tortoiseshell lyres were also frequently placed as funeral monuments in cemeteries, where their songs comforted the dead; she notes that they are antecedents of the winged, singing harp-bearing angels of Christian iconography (personal communication). 18. Homer, Iliad, 1:551.
19. Sch o lia o n T h eo critu s, XV:64.
20. Homer, Iliad, XIV:345-50. Though the context is war as well as love, there is no doubt that this passage does describe a hieros gam os between Hera and Zeus. 21. Plutarch, M oralia, XII (943b). 22. On the various possibilities of Indo-European afterworlds, including the gloomy, dark underworld, see Hansen (1987, 8-64). 23. Homer, Iliad, XVIII:570. 24. Fragment. Hesiod tells us that Linos is called upon at both the beginnings and endings of feasts and dances. 25. According to Famell (1896-1909, V:226), there is a fifth century decree that orders the Athenian colonists of Brea to send an annual sacrifice of a phallus to the Dionysia. The ensuing ritual is called the “phallagogia.”Famell (V:225) calls this festival “in some ways the most magnificent of all Attic ceremonies.” 26. Famell translates the name Anthesteria as “the festival that causes things to bloom” (ibid., V:222). 27. In the early ritual, Dionysus was a vegetation (and perhaps fertility) god, but his role as god ofwine was a later one. See Famell (ibid., V: 118). On the Orphic Dionysiac rituals, see Nilsson and Rose in Cary et al. (1949, 2 8 8 -8 9 ; 627-28). See also Kerenyi (1951, 253-56). Kerenyi tells the myth in which Dionysus made the fig-wood phallus, carried in the liknon, the winnowing fan (259). See Kem (1922) for texts on Orphic religion and mysteries. 28. See Kerenyi (1951, 254-55). 29. If we compare Aphrodite to the Sumerian-Akkadian-Babylonian InannaIshtar, goddess of love, war, and holder of all of the Mes, the attributes of civi lization, we can understand that Aphrodite has been stripped of much of her pre-Greek power and functionality.
Chapter Nine / The Etruscan Religion
1. Greeks colonized southern Italy and Sicily beginning c. 750 B.c. Earlier evi dence of Greek material probably bespeaks sporadic contact rather than colo nization. In southern Italy, Rhegium was founded sometime before 720 b.c. The first Greek colony in Sicily, Naxus, was founded c. 734 b.c. Syracuse was colo nized c. 733 b.c. See A. J. Graham (1982, III: 91 ff). Greek colonization on the
224 / Editor’s Notes to Pages 1 5 8 -1 6 5



coasts of France and Spain, by the Greek Phocaeans, probably took place c. 600 b.c. See Graham (139 ff). 2. On Etruscan inscriptions, see Puhvel (1984), Pallottino (1968), and Bonfante (1990, 27-48). 3. Livy, ab u r b e condita libri (History of Rome), I.xxxiv.9; xxxix.3-4. She was also very wise, as evidenced by her counsel to her son-in-law Servius Tullius (I.xli.3-4) that, since he was unable to function intellectually at the death of her husband, Tarquinius Priscus, and to make himself king, then he should make use of h e r wisdom. And she proceeded to use her intellect to ensure Servius’s smooth takeover. In this way, she also functioned as the bestower of sovereignty. See also l.xlvii.6, where she is accused of bestowing the royal power upon both her hus band and her son-in-law. 4. This temple actually stood just outside the Etruscan city-state of Veii, in the Portonaccio area. It has been dated to the last quarter of the sixth century b.c. See Bonfante and Bonfante (1985,32). According to the authors, the temple was ded icated to Minerva (Etruscan Menrva: Latin Minerva). Although it was destroyed in 396 b.c., it continued to be used as an open-air place of worship for at least a century. See Banti (1973, 61). 5. On Etruscan inscriptions, see above. 6. According to Ovid (A m oves, 111:13.35), Halaesus taught the Faliscans the sacred rites ofJuno, Iunonia Sacra. 7. Leucothea means, literally, “White Goddess.” 8. On Etruscan mirrors— their chemical composition, manufacture, usage, and inscriptions— see de Grummond (1 9 8 2 ,4 9 ff). Some of the inscriptions are quite charming. For example, on a mirror from Praeneste, a young man and woman are depicted playing a game on a game board. The young woman says, in archaic Latin, d ev in ca m ted, “1 am going to beat you.” The young man answers, opeinod, “I do believe you are” (75). See also Emout (1973, 30). 9. Although the Etruscan Turan may have been inherited from Old Europe, Marija Gimbutas was not attempting to connect Aphrodite here with Old Euro pean goddesses; she believed that Aphrodite was inherited from the Near East. 10. Compare the Greek (in origin, Thraco-Phrygian) Semele, mother of the vine god Dionysos; she is related linguistically to the Lithuanian Žemyna, the Lat vian Žemes Mate, and the Slavic Mat’ Syra Zemlya, “mother moist earth.”See Dex ter (1990, 41-42). 11. For a depiction and discussion of Etruscan tomb paintings, see Moretti (1970); see also Keller (1974, 23-37). 12. From the Etruscans, the Romans borrowed haruspicy, and they practiced this form of divination until the end of the fourth century a .d ., although in ear lier centuries some Romans were skeptical of the practice. See Keller (1974, 398). 13. Pallottino (1968; 1975, 96) cites extant Etruscan literature, in which we may make out votive formulae, liturgical expressions, and prayers. Also see Keller (1974,397), who cites Lucretius’ description of “Tyrrhenian songs”read from right to left. Roman priests adapted Etruscan practices of divination, learning how to divine for themselves; but Romans also turned to Etruscan priests for the inter pretation of omens and the foretelling of the future. This practice may have pre served Etruscan ritual formulae. 14. This concluding section was written by the editor.

Chapter Ten / The Basque Religion
1. See Tessier (1917). Among the Basques, the oldest child, male or female, is the heir. A marital relationship between two heirs is an equalitarian one. When a female heir marries a male nonheir, then the female has the greater rights in the marriage. To the situation of Basque female heirs, compare that of the ancient Irish b a n c h o m a rb a e , the woman who could inherit; see Dexter (1997a). Further, the high status of the Basque woman is confirmed by Terence Wilbur, author of P ro leg o m en a to a G r a m m a r o f B a sq u e (1979). Professor Wilbur asserts, “As a mat ter of fact, etch ek o a n d e ra ia (the ‘woman of the house’) is the real boss in the Basque Country. She wears the keys to the house” (personal communication, May 1997). 2. This concluding section was written by the editor.
Chapter Eleven / The Celtic Religion
1. Tacitus, G erm a n ia , 40. For further discussion, s e e below. 2. The high status and economic viability of Indo-European Celtic women is probably due to their particular influence within the western European matri-patrilineal tribes that assimilated with the Indo-Europeans. See Dexter in Marier, ed. (1997a, 218-36). 3. Bergquist and Taylor (1987) give detailed reasons why the Gundestrup caul dron is thought to belong to the Thracian repoussé sheet-silver-working tradition of southeast Europe. But there is evidence also for a Celtic tradition. See T. G. E. Powell (1 9 5 8 ,1 5 4 ,1 6 7 -6 8 ). According to Powell, warriors depicted on the caul dron are seen with Celtic warrior equipment; because the stylistic aspects of the animals point to a Middle Danubian origin, Powell believes that the crafters of the cauldron may have been members of a Celtic tribe living in that region, the Scordistae (which Gimbutas called Scordisci). See also Polomé (1989a, 73). 4. Kim McCone has interpreted this plate as depicting a ritual of male initia tion. In the lower register, men (probably youths) march to the vessel and are immersed therein. The deity is shown immersing one of the men. (Therefore, this would be not a sacrifice but a ritual immersion leading to “rebirth”into a new class of men.) The upper register shows men mounted on horses, wearing helmets and short tunics, perhaps ready now to be warriors. A wolf faces the uninitiated youths of the lower register. There is much evidence to relate the wolfwith Indo-European youths of good birth who are in Umbo between childhood and manhood. These youths join a “wolf-band”— a Mànnerbund— and live together in the woods, as outlaws, before attaining adulthood, with attendant inheritance of property and marriage. The solution to the young Ulster hero Cü Chulainn’s unmanageable mar tial frenzy, that of immersing him into three vats of cold water, serves as a textual parallel to this sort of evidence of a ritual quasi-baptism. See McCone (1986,16-17). 5. De Bello G allico: a work in seven volumes. 6. According to Celtic folklorist Angélique Gulermovich Epstein (personal com munication), artos is found in compounds and oblique cases, but not in the nom inative case; hence the asterisk. 7. For an interpretation and cognate mythology of Danu, see Dexter (1990a). 8. According to Angélique Gulermovich Epstein (personal communication), her name also appears as uninflected A n a n n .
226 / Editor’s Notes to Pages 1 7 2 - 1 8 5



9. Puhvel (1970) believes that etymologically she is a woman associated with a ritual involving drunkenness due to an intoxicating honey drink. 10. This is now the Hill of Allen. 11. A “woman of the sidh, the fairy mound.” 12. This concluding section has been added by the editor.
Chapter Twelve / The Germanic Religion
1. On Marija Gimbutas’ three-wave migration theory, see introduction. See also Dexter and Jones-Bley, eds. (1997, 195-300). 2. According to the Germanic scholar Professor Edgar C. Polome (personal communication), the Germanic tribes gelled as a separate ethnic entity around the middle of the first millennium b.c . (Jastorf culture). Further, according to Jur gen Udolph (1994, 935 ff), the Bronze Age Scandinavians may not have been already Germanic; using a mainly hydronymic argument, Udolph hypothesizes that Scandinavia was colonized from the south by Germanic tribes in the first mil lennium B.C. 3. On runes and magic, see Flowers (1986); on the magical runic term alu, “beer,” s e e Polome (1996). 4. Old Norse Odin, Old Saxon Woden, Old High German Wuotan, from PIE *u a t, “to be furious.” 5. Tacitus, G erm a n ia , 40. This act of lustration regenerated the vital forces of the goddess. The sacrificed slaves added “fuel”to her own energies and contributed to the fertility of the earth. See Dexter (1990, 99). On the etymology of Nerthus, see Polome (1987, 460). 6. Many other goddesses also underwent this ritual bathing; for example, the Greek goddess Hera restored her virginity each year by ritually bathing in the river Canathus. See Dexter (1990, 99, 130, 170).
7. V o lu sp a , 2 0 .
8 . Gullveig (ibid., 21) is the “drunkenness of gold,” from Old Norse gull, “gold,” and veig, “intoxicating drink.”Like Freyja, Gullveig practices seidr, and Freyja weeps tears of red-gold when her husband goes on longjourneys (Snorri Sturluson 1929, 36); Gullveig is probably an epithet for Freyja herself. See Polome (1989, 60-61). 9. According to Polome in Eliade, ed. (1987, 43 8 -3 9 ), love and sexuality are probably the most important of her functions within the Germanic pantheon. See also Polome (1989, 61) 10. But we should note that Fulla, in Germanic myth, does not accrue the neg ativity that surrounds the myth of Pandora. Fulla is not responsible for the woes of humanity. 11. See editor’s introduction and chapter 6, above.
Chapter Thirteen / The Baltic Religion
1. Literally a “drive to the east,” this phrase indicates the movement of med ieval Germans into east-central Europe for the purposes of converting the inhab itants of these countries and conquering them. 2. Thereafter, the Prussian language became extinct. Although Prussia was con quered and converted to Christianity by the thirteenth century, we know that Prus sian pagan religious practices continued to be practiced until the language became
227 / Editor’s Notes to Pages 1 8 5 - 1 9 8



extinct in the seventeenth century, since decrees forbidding those practices con tinued to be issued by the Christian rulers until that time. See Usačiovaitė injonesBley and Huld (1996, 204-17). 3. An excellent selection of Latvian mythological songs is contained in Jonval (1929), in Latvian with French translation. See also Jouet (1989) for translations and discussion of the songs. 4. We may recall that Hera, the Greek goddess of marriage, was also associ ated with the cuckoo. Before Zeus and Hera were married, Zeus turned himself into a cuckoo and perched at Hera’s knee. Seeing it shivering from the cold, Hera put the bird into her blouse. Zeus transformed himself back into his divine shape and attempted to rape Hera. Instead, he married her. The Scholia on Theocritus (XV:64) describes a statue of Hera in her sanctuary at Argos: in one hand she held a scepter topped by a cuckoo. 5. Biezais (1955, 262, No. 29165). Marija Gimbutas translated these and other Latvian folk songs from Biezais’ Latvian-German texts. 6. Ibid., 256, No. 32446. 7. Ibid., 327, No. 32447. 8. Ibid., 253, No. 3 2 4 1 6 ,6 . 9. According to Greimas (1979, 35 -3 6 ) (translated by Irene Luksis Goddard), as late as the beginning of the twentieth century, around (the town of) Švenčionys people used to say that “the bees are weaving honeycombs.” This quotation also appears in Dundulienė (1990, 117). 10. The source has not been given. 11 .John Malalas wrote about old Lithuanian customs and beliefs in his C hron icle (1261). A Bulgarian clergyman, Grigorius, translated Malalas’ Greek text, and the translated work found its way to Russia, where it was edited and expanded. In particular, the citations on Lithuanian deities come from the Russian expan sion. I am indebted to Irene Luksis Goddard, a member of the Los Angeles, Cal ifornia, Lithuanian community, for information on this early source. For the past several years Ms. Goddard, a former chemist, has been writing about her youth in Lithuania, which was contemporaneous to Marija Gimbutas’. 12. See Pokomy (1 9 5 9 ,1 3 ), *a ig (1). 1 am indebted to Martin Huld for point ing out both the proto-form and the Polish cognate, je z d a , “witch,” the meaning of which throws much light on the semantic turn taken by the word. 13. According to Irene Luksis Goddard (personal communication), there was a similar panacea made of whiskey or vodka and a snake. It was called gyvatinė, fromgyvate, “snake.”Goddard writes that she remembers seeing bottles with snakes in clear liquid at the outdoor market in her childhood town in Lithuania, and that the belief was that the contents would cure “whatever ails you.” 14. For a detailed description of Vily and Rusalld, see Barber in Dexter and Polomė, eds. (1997, 6-47). 15. O m phalos is the Greek word for “navel”; the ancient Greeks considered the holy cave at Delphi to be the navel— the center— of the world. 16. This is a Near Eastern phenomenon as well. In ancient Sumer the earth mother goddess was Nin-Hursag, “mountain lady.” 17. Marija Gimbutas gives as her source Greimas (1993), but the text does not appear to be contained either in T h e Sem iotics o f Passions (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1993) or in Festschrift, A. J. G reim as a n d the N a tu re o f M ea nin g (London and Sydney: Croom Helm, 1993). Further, it does not seem to be included

in O f G ods a n d M en (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1992) or the earlier
Lithuanian version, A p ie dievus ir ž m o n e s: L ietuv iu m itoligijos studijos (Chicago: A
and M Publications, 1979). Irene Luksis Goddard has found a description of a similar ritual, involving pairs of animals and fowl offered to the god Ž em ininkas. The priest and then the other participants beat the animals with sticks until they were dead (personal communication). 18. Greimas (1979, 35-36). 19. See Greimas (1979, 36). Irene Luksis Goddard believes that kaukoratis refers to a “mushroom ring,”which she compares to a fairyring (personal communication).
