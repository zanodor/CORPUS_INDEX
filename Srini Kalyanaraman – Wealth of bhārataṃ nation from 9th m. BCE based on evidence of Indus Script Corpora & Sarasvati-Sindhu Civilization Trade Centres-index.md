Wealth of bhārataṃ nation from 9th m. BCE based on evidence of Indus Script Corpora & Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization Trade Centres
-- Decipherment of Shu-ilishu cylinder seal & Trade interactions between Meluhha & Mesopotamia
How did the brahma 'hymn' R̥ gveda ̥rca RV 3.53.12 of viśvāmitra protect bhārataṃ janam? I submit that this is a metaphor for the enquiry into knowledge systems which made bhārataṃ janam, the Meluhha people of Meluhha nation (Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization Area) the richest nation on the globe, from the days of the Neolithic Revolution, 9000 to 6500 BCE and the Tin-Bronze Revolution from 7th m. BCE?
This monograph presents an outline of how the wealth of the Meluhha bhārataṃ nation was achieved principally through work of farmers, artisans, seafaring merchants, utilising the natural land and mineral resources in a commonwealth.
R̥ gveda ̥rca RV 3.53.12 is rendered in पद--पाठ which is a method of arranging each word
of a Vedic text separately in its original form [cf. पद] without regard to the rules
of संधि ; cf. क्रम and संधिता-पाठ.
Note that metrics necessitates degrees of freedom in sequencing of words NOT in पद--पाठ
but in chandas sequence. Generally, spoken forms of sentences follow पद--पाठ syntax to convey meaning.
yah = who; aham= I; ime = these; rodasī = heaven and earth; ubhe = to both (and); indram = to Indra; atuṣṭavam = praised; (mama = I); viśvāmitrasya = Of viśvāmitra; idam = this; brahma = by hymn; bhāratam = Of the lineage/metallurgical competenc of Bharata; janam = To men; rakṣati = Protects.
Sentence with ordered syntax: I, Viśvāmitra Gāthina, who praised both the heaven and earth and Indra, the hymn of the same,(hymn of Viśvāmitra) protects the men of the lineage/metallurgical competence of Bharata.
Essence of Message: Sacred hymn of Viśvāmitra first sung in prayer to Indra, by Viśvāmitra protects the Bharata metalworking people.
Note: I use the alternative 'metallurgical competence' to explain Bharata because of the occurrence of this word in Marathi with a unique reference to a unique metal alloy: bharata, baran is a metal alloy of 5 copper, 4 zinc and 1 tin (Marathi.Punjabi). The expression in
Marathi is significant: भरताचें भांडें bharatācē mbhāṇḍēṃ n A vessel made of the
metal भरतT.The semantics are thus, related to metal work and work with metal ores obtained from mountains. Thus, the expression bhārataṃ janam also refers to the people working in

Indra but to Indra and mountain (इन्द्रः , इन्द्रापवर्तौ ).

This monograph is organized in two sections to signify Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization Trade Centres:
Section 1. Decipherment of Shu-ilishu cylinder seal in Indus Script with Cuneiform text
Section 2. Evidence for & significance of trade transactions between Meluhha and Mesopotamia
Meluhha was the Akkadian name for Indus Sarasvati Valleys. Early texts (c. 2200 BCE) seem to indicate that Meluhha is to the east, suggesting either the Indus valley or India. However, much later texts documenting the exploits of King Assurbanipal of Assyria (668–627 BCE), long after the Indus Valley civilization had ceased to exist, seem to imply that Meluhha is to be found either in south India or in Africa, somewhere near Egypt.(Hansman, John (1973). "A "Periplus" of Magan and Meluhha". Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London. 36 (3): 554–587.)
Section 1. Decipherment of Shu-ilishu cylinder seal in Indus Script with Cuneiform text
--Indus Script & cuneiform text on cylinder seal of Shu-ilishu, interpreter of the language of Meluhha country (Sarasvati Sindhu Civilization)
-- Shu-ilishu cylinder seal is in bilingual cuneiform and Meluhha (Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization) Indus Script
1. cuneiform script is a syllabic text which details the owner of the seal who is an interpreter of Meluhha language of Meluhha country;
2. Indus Script hieroglyphs are pictorial motifs of the two Meluhha traders who are Meluhha speakers.

“This shows a seated person of high rank, royal or divine, receiving two standing visitors. A bearded dwarf perches on the seated person’s lap, his head turned to face the dignitary. The first visitor seems to be addressing the seated dignitay with the help of a hand gesture, as is the dwarf. The seal’s accompanying cuneiform inscription reads as follows: ‘su-i-li-su/emebal me-luh-ha’, which translates as: ‘Su-ilisu, interpreter of the Meluhhan language’possibly the name of the dwarf (opinions differ). Sadly, no more is known about Su-ilisu. ‘We can imagine that, like the other Meluhhans, he had established some close ties within

Mesopotamia’, speculates Wright. Perhaps he began as a merchant from the Indus area, learned how to speak Akkadian and then ‘forged a new profession as a translator’ for his fellow merchants. Alternatively, he could have been an Akkadian-speaking native who saw a business opportunity through learning the language of Meluhha. Either way, this unique seal offers some slight encouragement that Mesopotamian excavation may one day yield the Holy Grail of Indus Script decipherment: a bilingual inscription written in both cuneiform and the Indus Script.” (Andrew Robinson, 2015, The Indus: Lost Civilizations, Reaktion Books, pp.101-102)
The Shu-ilishu cylinder seal is a clear evidence of the Meluhha merchants trading in copper and tin, signified by the field symbols vividly portrayed on the cylinder seal.
The Meluhha merchant/artificer carries melh, m ̤reka 'goat or antelope' rebus: milakkhu 'copper'; his right hand is raised: eraka 'upraised arm' rebus: eraka 'metal infusion'
The accompanying lady is also a Meluhha trader/artificer; she carries a ranku 'liquid measure' rebus: ranku 'tin'. Thus, the pictorial motifs of the two traders signify that they are traders in copper and tin and work with 'metal infusion' (i.e., make cire perdue, lost-wax casting method bronze metal statues, pots and pans, metalware, metal equipment).
On the field is shown a crucbile:
kuṭhāru 'crucible' rebus: kuṭhāru 'armourer'. The seated person of high rank may be such a kuṭhāru 'armourer' signified by the hieroglyph kuṭhāru 'crucible' on the top register of the cylinder seal.
Thus, the cylinder seal signifies a trade transaction between a Mesopotamian armourer (Akkadian speaker) and Meluhhans settling a trade contract for their copper and tin. The transaction is mediated by Shu-ilishu, the Akkadian interpreter of Meluhha language.
Why bi-lingual seal? In the Akkadian court, Meluhhan language needed interpreters of the Meluhhan language; such interpreters resided in Mesopotamia.

Section 2. Evidence for & significance of trade transactions between Meluhha and Mesopotamia
There is sufficient archaeological evidence for the trade between Mesopotamia and the Indian subcontinent. Impressions of clay seals from the Indus Valley city of Harappa were evidently used to seal bundles of merchandise, as clay seal impressions with cord or sack marks on the reverse side testify. A number of these Indian seals have been found at Ur and other Mesopotamian sites.("urseals". hindunet.org. Archived from the original on 2000-1211; John Keay (2000). India: A History. p. 16.)
The Persian-Gulf style of circular stamped rather than rolled seals, also known from Dilmun, that appear at Lothal in Gujarat, India, and Failaka Island (Kuwait), as well as in Mesopotamia, are convincing corroboration of the long-distance sea trade network, which G.L. Possehl has called a "Middle Asian Interaction Sphere".(Middle Asian Interaction Sphere”, Expedition 49/1)) What the commerce consisted of is less sure: timber and precious woods, ivory, lapis lazuli, gold, and luxury goods such as carnelian and glazed stone beads, pearls from the Persian Gulf, and shell and bone inlays, were among the goods sent to Mesopotamia in exchange for silver, tin, woolen textiles, perhaps oil and grains and other foods. Copper ingots, certainly, bitumen, which occurred naturally in Mesopotamia, may have been exchanged for cotton textiles and chickens, major products of the Indus region that are not native to Mesopotamia—all these have been instanced.
Mesopotamia had been an intermediary in the trade of lapis lazuli between South Asia and Egypt since at least about 3200 BCE, in the context of Egypt-Mesopotamia
relations. (Demand, Nancy H. (2011). The Mediterranean Context of Early Greek History. John Wiley & Sons. pp. 71–72. Rowlands, Michael J. (1987). Centre and Periphery in the Ancient World. Cambridge University Press. p. 37)

Later era
Sculpture of a Mesopotamian boat, 2700-2600 BCE.
In the Assyrian and Hellenistic eras, cuneiform texts continued to use (or revive) old place names, giving a perhaps artificial sense of continuity between contemporary events and
events of the distant past.(Van De Mieroop, Marc (1997). The Ancient Mesopotamian City. Oxford: Clarendon Press. p. 44.) For example, Media is referred to as "the land of the Gutians", (Sachs & Hunger (1988). Astronomical Diaries & Related Texts from Babylonia, vol.1. Vienna: Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften. pp. 330 Obv.18.) a people who had been prominent around 2000 BCE.
Meluhha also appears in these texts, in contexts suggesting that "Meluhha" and "Magan" were kingdoms adjacent to Egypt. Assurbanipal writes about his first march against Egypt, "In my first campaign I marched against Magan, Meluhha, Tarka, king of Egypt and Ethiopia, whom Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, the father who begot me, had defeated, and whose land he brought under his sway." In the Hellenistic period, the term is sometimes used to refer to Ptolemaic Egypt, as in its account of a festival celebrating the conclusion of
the Sixth Syrian War. (Sachs & Hunger (1988). Astronomical Diaries & Related Texts from Babylonia, vol.2. Vienna: Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften. pp. 168 A Obv.14–15.)
These references do not necessarily mean that early references to Meluhha also referred to Egypt. Direct contacts between Sumer and the Indus Valley had ceased even during the Mature Harappan phase when Oman and Bahrain (Magan and Dilmun) became intermediaries. After the sack of Ur by the Elamites and subsequent invasions in Sumer, its trade and contacts shifted west and Meluhha passed almost into mythological memory. The resurfacing of the name could simply reflect cultural memory of a rich and distant land, its use in records of Achaemenid and Seleucid military expeditions serving to aggrandize those kings.

[quote] Evidence for imports from the Indus to Ur can be found from around 2350 BCE. Various objects made with shell species that are characteristic of the Indus coast, particularly Trubinella Pyrum and Fasciolaria Trapezium, have been found in the
archaeological sites of Mesopotamia dating from around 2500-2000 BCE. Carnelian beads from the Indus were found in Ur tombs dating to 2600–2450 BCE. In particular, carnelian beads with an etched design in white were probably imported from the Indus Valley, and made according to a technique of acid-etching developed by the Harappans. Lapis Lazuli was imported in great quantity by Egypt, and already used in many tombs of the Naqada II period (circa 3200 BCE). Lapis Lazuli probably originated in northern Afghanistan, as no other sources are known, and had to be transported across the Iranian plateau to Mesopotamia, and then Egypt.

Akkadian Empire records mention timber, carnelian and ivory as being imported from Meluhha by Meluhhan ships, Meluhha being generally considered as the Mesopotamian name for the Indus Valley.

— Inscription by Sargon of Akkad (ca.2270-2215 BCE)
After the collapse of the Akkadian Empire, Gudea, the ruler of Lagash, is recorded as having imported "translucent carnelian" from Meluhha. Various inscriptions also mention the presence of Meluhha traders and interpreters in Mesopotamia. About twenty seals have been found from the Akkadian and Ur III sites, that have connections with Harappa and often use Harappan symbols or writing.[unquote]

Indus pottery and seals have been found along the sea routes between the Indus and Mesopotamia, as in Ras-al-Jinz, at the tip of Arabia. (Drawings of Indus seals and
inscriptions discovered in Ras al-Jinz, in Cleuziou, Serge; Gnoli, Gherardo; Robin, Christian Julien; Tosi, Maurizio (1994).

“Sea levels have been rising about 100 meters over the last 15,000 years until modern times, with the effect that coast lines have been receding vastly. This is especially the case of the coast lines of the Indus and Mesopotamia, which were originally only separated by a distance of about 1000 kilometers, compared to 2000 kilometers today.[1] For the ancestors of the Sumerians, the distance between the coasts of the Mesopotamian area and the Indus area would have been much shorter than it is today. In particular the Persian Gulf, which is only about 30 meters deep today, would have been at least partially dry, and would have formed an extension of the Mesopotamian basin. The westernmost Harappan city was located on

Global sea levels and vegetation during the Last Ice Age. The coastline was still roughly similar in about 10,000 BCE. It shouldbe noted that during the Last Ice Age, Greater India was a cultivable arable land area since 24 ft. ice cover was signifficant only on Europe. This ice cover would have prevented agricultural activities in Europe during the Last Ice Age c. 115,000 – c. 11,700 Before Present.

Trade routes between Mesopotamia and the Indus would have been significantly shorter due to lower sea levels in the 3rd millennium BCE

Note on spelter: "Spelter, while sometimes used merely as a synonym for zinc, is often used to identify a zinc alloy. In this sense it might be an alloy of equal parts copper and zinc, i.e. a brass, used for hard soldering and brazing, or as an alloy, containinglead, that is used instead of bronze. In this usage it was common for many 19th-century cheap, cast articles such as candlesticks and clock cases...The word "pewter" is thought to be derived from the word "spelter". Zinc ingots formed by smelting might also be termed spelter." Skeat, Walter William (1893), An etymological dictionary of the English language (2nd ed.), Clarendon Press, pp. 438–439. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelter French Bronze is a form of bronze typically consisting of 91% copper, 2% tin, 6% zinc, and 1% lead.(Ripley, George; Dana, Charles Anderson (1861). The New American Cyclopaedia: A Popular Dictionary of General Knowledge 3. D. Appleton and Co. p. 729.) "The term French bronze was also used in connection with cheap zinc statuettes and other articles, which were finished to resemble real bronze, and some older texts call the faux-bronze finish itself "French bronze". Its composition was typically 5 parts hematite powder to 8 parts lead oxide, formed into a paste with spirits of wine. Variations in tint could be obtained by varying the proportions. The preparation was applied to the article to be bronzed with a soft brush, then polished with a hard brush after it had dried." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Bronze ( Watt, Alexander (1887). Electro-Metallurgy Practically Treated. D. Van Nostrand. pp. 211–212.)
"The term latten referred loosely to the copper alloys such as brass or bronze that appeared in the Middle Ages and through to the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It was used for monumental brasses, in decorative effects on borders, rivets or other details of metalwork (particularly armour), in livery and pilgrim badges or funerary effigies. Metalworkers commonly formed latten in thin sheets and used it to make church utensils. Brass of this period is made through the calamine brass process, from copper and zinc ore. Later brass was made with zinc metal from Champion's smelting process and is not generally referred to as latten. This calamine brass was generally manufactured as hammered sheet or "battery brass" (hammered by a "battery" of water-powered trip hammers) and cast brass was rare. "Latten" also refers to a type of tin plating on iron (or possibly some other base metal), which is known as white latten; and black latten refers to laten-brass, which is brass milled into thin plates or sheets. The term "latten" has also been used, rarely, to refer to lead alloys. In general, metal in thin sheets is said to be latten such as gold latten; and lattens (plural) refers to metal sheets between 1/64" and 1/32" in thickness."

On many hierolyph multiplexes, water-buffalo (rã̄ go) is associated with kANDa 'overflowing water'. The rebus renderings are: rāṅgā khaNDA 'zinc alloy implements'. The semantics of khaNDa 'implements' is attested in Santali: me~r.he~t khaNDa 'iron implements'.
Santali glosses
A lexicon suggests the semantics of Panini's compound अयस्--काण्ड [p= 85,1] m. n. " a
quantity of iron " or " excellent iron " , (g. कस्का *धद q.v.)( Pa1n2. 8-3 , 48)(MonierWilliams).
From the example of a compound gloss in Santali, I suggest that the suffix -kANDa in Samskritam should have referred to 'implements'. Indus Script hieroglyphs as hypertext components to signify kANDa 'implements' are: kANTa, 'overflowing
water' kANDa, 'arrow' gaNDa, 'four short circumscript strokes'.
A good example of the ‘overflowing’ Indus Script hieroglyph is the Mohenjo-daro pectoral.

Gypsum statuette. "A Gypsum statuette of a priestess or goddess from the Sumerian Dynastic period, most likely Inanna. ...She holds a sacred vessel from which the life-giving waters flow in two streams. Several gods and goddesses are shown thus with running water, including Inanna, and it speaks of their life-giving powers as only water brings life to the barren earth of Sumeria. The two streams of water are thought to stand for the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. This is the earliest of the group of statues and dates to c. 26002300 B.C. 150 mm tall."

These images are explained in terms of associated sacredness of Enki, who in Sumerian mythology (Enki and Ninhursag) is associated with Abzu where he lives with the source sweet waters.
The following semantic cluster indicates that the early compound: loha + kāṇḍa referred to copper articles, tools, pot and pans. The early semantics of 'copper' got expanded to cover 'iron and other metals'. It is suggested that the hieroglyph of an overflowing vase refers to this compound: lohakāṇḍā.
खांडा [ khāṇḍā ] m A kind of sword, straight, broad-bladed, two-edged, and round-ended (Marathi) M. lokhãḍ n. ʻironʼ(Marthi) yields the clue to the early semantics of khāṇḍā which should have referred to tools, pots and pans (of metal). Kumaoni has semantics: lokhaṛ ʻiron tools'. लोिोलोखंड [ lōhōlōkhaṇḍa ] n (लोि & लोखंड) Iron tools, vessels, or articles in general (Marathi).
Thus lohakāṇḍā would have referred to copper tools. The overflowing vase on the hands of Gudea would have referred to this compound, represented by the hieroglyphs and rendered rebus.

Loha (nt.) [Cp. Vedic loha, of Idg. *(e)reudh "red"; see also rohita & lohita] metal, esp. copper, brass or bronze. It is often used as a general term & the individual application is not always sharply defined. Its comprehensiveness is evident from the classification of loha at VbhA 63, where it is said lohan ti jātilohaŋ, vijāti ̊, kittima ̊, pisāca ̊ or natural metal, produced metal, artificial (i. e. alloys), & metal from the Pisāca district. Each is subdivided as follows: jāti ̊=ayo, sajjhaŋ, suvaṇṇaŋ, tipu, sīsaŋ, tambalohaŋ, vekantakalohaŋ; vijāti ̊=nāga - nāsika ̊; kittima ̊=kaŋsalohaŋ, vaṭṭa ̊, ārakūṭaŋ; pisāca ̊=morakkhakaŋ, puthukaŋ, malinakaŋ, capalakaŋ, selakaŋ, āṭakaŋ, bhallakaŋ, dūsilohaŋ. The description ends "Tesu pañca jātilohāni pāḷiyaŋ visuŋ vuttān' eva (i. e. the first category are severally spoken of in the Canon). Tambalohaŋ vekantakan ti imehi pana dvīhi jātilohehi saddhiŋ sesaŋ sabbam pi idha lohan ti veditabbaŋ." -- On loha in similes see J.P.T.S. 1907, 131. Cp. A iii.16=S v.92 (five alloys of gold: ayo, loha, tipu, sīsaŋ, sajjhaŋ); J v.45 (asi ̊); Miln 161 (suvaṇṇam pi jātivantaŋ lohena bhijjati); PvA 44, 95 (tamba ̊=loha), 221 (tatta -- loha -- secanaŋ pouring out of boiling metal, one of the five ordeals in Niraya). -- kaṭāha a copper (brass) receptacle Vin ii.170. -- kāra a metal worker, coppersmith, blacksmith Miln 331. -- kumbhī an iron cauldron Vin ii.170.

Lohatā (f.) [abstr. fr. loha] being a metal, in (suvaṇṇassa) aggalohatā the fact of gold being the best metal VvA 13. (Pali) agga- is explained: erka = ekke (Tbh. of arka) aka (Tbh. of arka) copper (metal); crystal (Kannada) eraka, er-aka = any metal infusion (Ka.Tu.); erako molten cast (Tulu) agasāle, agasāli, agasālavāḍu = a goldsmith (Telugu) cf. eruvai = copper (Tamil)
Thus loha in aggalohatā gets the semantics 'metal'.
“Sumerian words with a pre-Sumerian origin are:
professional names such as simug 'blacksmith' and tibira 'copper smith', 'metal-manufacturer' are not in origin Sumerian words.



21
Agricultural terms, like engar 'farmer', apin 'plow' and absin 'furrow', are neither of Sumerian origin.
Craftsman like nangar 'carpenter', agab 'leather worker'
Religious terms like sanga 'priest'
Some of the most ancient cities, like Kish, have names that are not Sumerian in origin.
These words must have been loan words from a substrate language. The words show how far the division in labor had progressed even before the Sumerians arrived."

The streams of water flowing the naked, bearded person are the signature tune of the times in Ancient Near East. This glyptic or overflowing pot held by Gudea, appears on hundreds of cylinder seals and friezes of many sites.
Overflowing water from a pot is a recurrent motif in Sumer-Elam-Mesopotamian contact areas – a motif demonstrated to be of semantic significance in the context of lapidarymetallurgy life activity of the artisans.

Gudea Basin. Water overflowing from vases. : The Representation of an Early Mesopotamian Ruler ... By Claudia E. Suter "The standing statue N (Fig. 5) holds a vase from which four streams of water flow down on each side of the dress into identical vases depicted on the pedestal, which are equally overflowing with water. Little fish swim up the streams to the vase held by Gudea. This statue evidently shows the ruler in possession of prosperity symbolized by the overflowing vase." (p.58)ayo 'fish' (Munda) Rebus: ayo 'iron' (Gujarati); ayas'metal' (Skt.) Together with lo, 'overflow', the compound word can be read as loh+ayas. The compound lohāyas is attested in ancient Indian texts, contrasted withkṛṣṇāyas, distinguishing red alloy metal (bronze) from black alloy metal (iron alloy). ayaskāṇḍa is a compound attested in Pāṇini; the word may be semantically explained as 'metal tools, pots and pans' or as alloyed metal.

(Beijing World Art Museum) Fish in water on statue, on viewer's right. Gudea's Temple Building "The goddesses wit overflowing vases. (Fig.8). The large limestone basin (SV.7) restored by Unger from twenty-six fragments is carved in relief on its outside. It shows a row of



26
goddesses walking on a stream of water. Between them they are holding vases from which water flows down into the stream. These, in turn, are fed with water poured from vases which are held by smaller-scale goddesses hovering above. All goddesses wear long pleated dresses, and crowns with a single horn pair. There are remains of at least six standing and four hovering goddesses. Considering the importance the number seven plays in Gudea's inscriptions, Unger's reconstruction of seven goddesses of each type is credible. The inscription on the basin, which relates its fashioning, designates it as a large S'IM, a relatively rare and only vagueely understood term, perhaps to be read agarinX. The fashioning of one or more S'IM is also related in the Cylinder inscriptions, and the finished artifact is mentioned again in the description of the temple...Since the metaphor paraphrasing the basin refers to th ceaseless flow of water, it is possible that the basin(s) mentioned in the account of Eninnu's construction is (are) identical with the fragmentary remains of the one (perhaps two?) actually found within the area of Gudea's Eninnu, as Unger presumed. Several similar and somewhat intuitive identifications of the goddesses with the overflowing vases have been proposed: Heuzey saw personifications of the Euphrates and Tigris; Unger saw personifications of sources and rain clouds that form the Tigris and identified them with Ningirsu and Baba's seven daughters; van Buren saw personifications of higher white clouds and lower rain clouds whom she assigned to Ea's circle. Neither are the seven (not fourteen!) daughters of Ningirsu and Baba ever associated with water, nor can fourteen personified clouds be made out in Ea's circle...The clue must be the overflowing vase which van Buren correctly interpreted as a symbol of abundance and prosperity. This interpretation is corroborated by the Gottertsypentext which states that the images of Kulullu is blessing with one hand (ikarrab) and holding abundance (HE.GAL) in the other. The protective spirit Kulullu is usually associated with abundance and divine benevolence, and may be reminiscent of the god bestowing the overflowing vase upon a human petititioner in much earlier presentation scenes. The narrative context in which the goddess with the overflowing vase occurs is confined to presentations of a human petititioner to a deity. The Akkadian seal fo the scribe Ili-Es'tar shows her accompanying the petitioner, not unlike a Lamma.

On the Urmamma Stela, she is hovering over the offering of flowing water to the ruler by the enthroned deity. In this scene the goddess underlines the gift bestowed on the ruler, and figures as a personification of it, while on the seal she may have implied and guaranteed that the petitioner who offers an antelope (?) is pleading for and will receive blessings of



29
abundance in return. The basin of Gudea is dedicated to Ningirsu, and may be understood as a plea for prosperity as well as a boast of its successful outcome."(Claudia E.

Inscription on base of skirt- God commands him to build house. Gudea is holding plans. Gudea depicted as strong, peaceful ruler. Vessel flowing with life-giving water w/ fish. Text on garment dedicates himself, the statue, and its temple to the goddess Geshtinanna.
According to the inscription this statue was made by Gudea, ruler of Lagash (c. 2100 BCE) for the temple of the goddess Geshtinanna. Gudea refurbished the temples of Girsu and 11 statues of him have been found in excavations at the site. Nine others including this one were sold on the art market. It has been suggested that this statue is a forgery. Unlike the hard diorite of the excavated statues, it is made of soft calcite, and shows a ruler with a flowing vase which elsewhere in Mesopotamian art is only held by gods. It also differs stylistically from the excavated statues. On the other hand, the Sumerian inscription appears to be genuine and would be very difficult to fake. Statues of Gudea show him standing or sitting. Ine one, he rests on his knee a plan of the temple he is building. On some statues Gudea has a shaven head, while on others like this one he wears a headdress covered with spirals, probably indicating that it was made out of fur. Height 61 cm. The overflowing water from the vase is a hieroglyph comparable to the pectoral of Mohenjo-daro showing an overflowing pot together with a one-horned young bull and standard device in front. The diorite from Magan (Oman), and timber from Dilmun (Bahrain) obtained by Gudea could have come from Meluhha.
"The goddess Geshtinanna was known as “chief scribe” (Lambert 1990, 298– 299) and probably was a patron of scribes, as was Nidaba/Nisaba (Micha-lowski 2002). " http://www.academia.edu/2360254/Temple_Sacred_Prostitution_in_Ancient_Mesopota mia_Revisited
That the hieroglyph of pot/vase overflowing with water is a recurring theme can be seen from other cylinder seals, including Ibni-Sharrum cylinder seal. Such an imagery also occurs on a fragment of a stele, showing part of a lion and vases.

Some indicators for further research:
Amiet’s landmark thesis regarding the proposed ‘ethnic duality’ of Elam (Amiet 1979a; 1979b) has already been discussed...This thesis holds that there where two distinct, though interrelated ‘ethnic’ groups present across several periods in Elam, a ‘native’ or indigenous ‘Iranian’/Elamite population at home in the highlands, and an ethnically Mesopotamian population in the lowlands (Amiet 1979a: 195 – 197), presumably immigrant at some point, in the ancient or immediate past (though the fact that this population was not generally assimilated and retained some of its Mesopotamian identity and aspect is essential to this reconstruction).

Seal No. 198 Legrain 1921:51 “AO. 512, nos 216, 5012” “trois petits bons-homme, les bras tombants, ou tenant de petits vases”. Jacob L. Dahl (2012) reconstructs the drawing after a review of the original seal and concludes that the three 'human' figures may NOT represent 'humanoid figures' and concluded: '''...but rather inanimate objects arranged together with objects in a way that suggests a line-up of offerings'. He further surmises that offerings of produce are represented by different vases and baskets in the top register next to the lion, either from a specific institution represented by the bovine family in the lower register (the



37
small animal drawn between the bulls is a calf), or simply produce obtained from the animals. May be the ruler was represented by the lion. This surmise leads to Dahl's conclusion:"That again exemplifies the fluid nature of writing during the formative period, where signs in the writing system could exist as non-writing symbols and symbols, such as standards or the like, could enter into the writing as signs for offices or households."

Neolithic expansion (9000–6500 BCE)
[quote] A first period of indirect contacts seems to have occurred as a consequence of the Neolithic Revolution and the diffusion of agriculture after 9000 BCE. The prehistoric agriculture of South Asia is thought to have combined local resources, such as humped cattle, with agricultural resources from the Near East as a first step in the 8th–7th millennium BCE, to which were later added resources from Africa and East Asia from the 3rd millennium BCE. Mehrgarh is one of the earliest sites with evidence of farming and herding in South Asia. At Mehrgarh, around 7000 BCE, the full set of Near Eastern incipient agricultural products can be found: wheat, barley, as well as goats, sheep and cattle. The rectangular houses of Merghah as well as the female figurines are essentially identical with those of the Near East.
The Near-Eastern origin of South Asian agriculture is generally accepted, and it has been the "virtual archaeological dogma for decades". Gregory Possehl however argues for a more nuanced model, in which the early domestication of plant and animal species may have occurred in a wide area from the Mediterranean to the Indus, in which new technology and ideas circulated fast and were widely shared. Today, the main objection to this model lies in



38
the fact that wildwheat has never been found in South Asia, suggesting that either wheat was first domesticated in the Near-East from well-known domestic wild species and then brought to South Asia, or that wild wheat existed in the past in South Asia but somehow became extinct without leaving a trace.
Jean-François Jarrige argues for an independent origin of Mehrgarh. Jarrige notes "the assumption that farming economy was introduced full-fledged from Near-East to South Asia,"[28][c] and the similarities between Neolithic sites from eastern Mesopotamia and the western Indus valley, which are evidence of a "cultural continuum" between those sites. But given the originality of Mehrgarh, Jarrige concludes that Mehrgarh has an earlier local background," and is not a "'backwater' of the Neolithic culture of the Near East” [unquote] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus%E2%80%93Mesopotamia_relations

Neolithic fertility goddesses in Mehrgarh are similar to those of the Near-East.[11] They are all part of the Neolithic ‘Venus figurines’ tradition, the abundant breasts and hips of these figurines suggest links to fertility and procreation.

See: Mohenjo-daro boat tablet is Rosetta stone for ḍhālako ox-hide-shape copper & tin ingots cargo of Meluhha merchants https://tinyurl.com/yxcave2w
A characteristic feature of Tin-Bronze Age is the use of ox-hide-shaped large copper and tin metal ingots as cargo for transport by seafaring merchants.
Such cargo has been identified in shipwrecks of Gelidonya and Uluburn. The ox-hideshape of ingots was evidenced for both copper and tin ingots. Such a pair of ingots was shown as cargo on a boat on a Mohenjo-daro tablet. m1429 Prism tablet with Indus inscriptions on 3 sides. Since Indus Script writing is most pronounced in the Mature phase of Sarasvati Civilization, the tablet can be dated to between ca. 2500 -1900 BCE. It is surmised that the ingots shown on the boat were produced by Meluhha merchants because the language used in the script is Meluhha rebur renderings of metalwork.

Ox-hide ingot is so-called because of its shape https://www.andywhiteanthropology.com/blog/the-oxhide-ingot-from-lake-gogebicmichigan " of Turkey (source in text). For those of you unfamiliar with the term, an oxhide ingot is an ingot of copper cast into a quadrilateral shape with concave sides and four "handles" (apparently its called an “oxhide” because it resembles a stretched animal hide in shape). During the Bronze Age in the Mediterranean (ca. 3200-1000 BC), copper was smelted and cast into ingots of this shape weighing about 60-70 pounds (~30 kg) for transport. "

Copper from Gujarat used in Mesopotmia, 3rd millennium BCE, evidenced by lead isotope analyses of tin-bronze objects; report by Begemann F. et al. 1. Title: Über das frühe Kupfer Mesopotamiens 2.

Geographical locations of sites of Mesopotamia from which artifacts were analyzed in this work (After Fig. 1 in Begemann, F. et al, 2009 loc.cit.) The conclusion is: "Unsere bleiisotopische evidenz legt nahe, das in Mesopotamien fur legierung mit zinn verwendete kupfer urudu-luh-ha stamme aus Indien, was ebenfalls vertraglich ist mit einem import via dilmun." (Trans. Our lead isotope evidence suggests that the urudu-luh-ha copper used in Mesopotamia for tin alloying is from India, which is also contracted with an import via Dilmun.)" (opcit., p.28) 3. A lead isotope study »On the Early copper of Mesopotamia« reports on copper-base artefacts ranging in age from the 4th millennium BCE (Uruk period) to the Akkadian at the end of the 3rd millennium BCE. Arguments are presented that, in the (tin)bronzes, the lead associated with the tin used for alloying did not contribute to the total in any detectable way. Hence, the lead isotopy traces the copper and cannot address the problem of the provenance of tin. The data suggest as possible source region of the copper a variety of ore occurrences in Anatolia, Iran, Oman, Palestine and, rather unexpectedly (by us), from India. During the earliest period the isotopic signature of ores from Central and North Anatolia is dominant; during the next millennium this region loses its importance and is hardly present any more at all. Instead, southeast Anatolia, central Iran, Oman, Feinan-Timna in the rift valley between Dead Sea and Red Sea, and sources in the Caucasus are now potential suppliers of the copper. Generally, an unambiguous assignment of an artefact to any of the ores is not possible because the isotopic fingerprints of ore occurrences are not unique. In our suite of samples bronze objects become important during ED III (middle of the 3rd millennium BCE) but they never make up more than 50 % of the total. They are distinguished in their lead isotopy by very high 206Pb-normalized abundance ratios. As source of such copper we suggest Gujarat/Southern Rajasthan which, on general grounds, has been proposed before to have been the most important supplier of copper in Ancient India. We propose this Indian copper to have been arsenic-poor and to be the urudu-luh-ha variety which is one of the two sorts of purified copper mentioned in contemporaneous written texts from Mesopotamia to have been in circulation there concurrently.

I posit that, as argued in the above-cited monograph that the largest tin belt of the globe was in the river basins of Himalayan rivers Mekong, Irrawaddy and Salween which powered the Tin-Bronze Revolution of 3rd millennium BCE, evidenced in Mesopotamia. These rivers ground down granite rocks to accumulate placer deposits of cassiterite (tin ore) in these river basins thus facilitating an Ancient Maritime Tin Route which linked AFEwith ANE.
The largest tin belt of the globe is in Ancient Far East
Cuneiform texts record long distance copper trade
"Cuneiform texts from the Late Uruk/Jemdet Nasr Period to the Old Babylonian Period (c. 3100-1750 B.C.) record the importation by sea of copper from Meluhha (probably northwest India), Magan (likely southeastern Arabia), and Dilmun (probably modern Bahrain) by Mesopotamian merchants, probably working either as agents for the city temple or rulers.(1) Some trade by private individuals took place as well, though on a smaller scale. (2) The archives of one merchant from Old Babylonian period Ur were excavated by Woolley; these record the importation of copper from Tilmun (probably in Iran) via the Persian Gulf, as well as various disputes with customers over the quality of his copper and the speed of his deliveries. (3) Production of finished copper and bronze products seems to have followed a similar pattern as Pylos, Alalakh, and Ugarit in Third Dynasty Ur (c. 2100 B.C.E.); at all of these sites, clay tablets record the allotment of copper to smiths for the production of weapons and other tems.(4)" (Michael Rice Jones, 2007, Oxhide ingots, coper production, and the mediterranean trade in copper and other metals in the Bronze Age, Thsesis submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies of Texas A&M University, 418 pages: p.62).

"Metal ores, particularly the ores of copper and tin that became so important in the Bronze Age, take an enormous amount of labor and technological expertise to extract from the natural environment and process into useful finished products. Metal ores also occur in geographically localized areas, which would have limited access of prehistoric communities to metals and encouraged long distance trade between them. By the second millennium B.C.,Mediterranean societies had developed complex trade networks to transport and exchange metals and other bulk goods over long distances. Copper, particularly as the main component of bronze, became one the most important materials for tools, weapons, and statusenhancing luxury goods during the Bronze Age." (5)(ibid., p.1)
Cuneiform texts record long distance trade in tin
"Texts from the palace of Zimri-lin (c.1780-1760 B.C.) of Mari in northern Syria attest to a thriving trade in tin operated by Assyrian merchants, who exported tin to Anatolia for twice the price at which they had purchased it.(6) These records indicate that copper and bronze were imported to Mari from Alashia, and that tin was imported to Mari from the Mesopotamian city of Esnunna; it was then transported to various cities in Syria and Palestine, ultimately reaching Ugarit.(7) The source of the tin from Mari is unknown, but it may have been transported overland from eastern Afghanistan.(8) One document records the purchase of tin by individuals called “the Caphtorite” (usually translated as ‘the Cretan’), who received 20 minas of tin “for the second time,” and “the Carian,” who received an unknown amount of tin.(9) The foreigners in Mari were likely agents for purchasing tin and other goods in the city.(10) Various objects from “Kaptara”, usually identified as Keftiu or Crete, are mentioned in the Mari texts as well; therefore, it seems likely that the tin route continued further west to Crete and Anatolia.(11) References to objects and materials connected with Caphtor or Keftiu are also known from several Bronze-Age texts from Mari. Since references to metal objects of ‘Keftian’ origin, workmanship, or style are the most prominent associations with the name, Keftiu seems to have been known especially for its metalwork.(12) Scattered references to the name Keftiu appear in New Kingdom Egyptian texts as well, dating from perhaps as early as c. 2300 B.C., through the second and first millennia B.C.E, to the most recent references in the Roman period.(13) Keftiu is most commonly identified with Crete, although locations such as Cyprus,Cilicia, and the Cyclades have also been proposed.(14) The sophisticated Minoan metallurgy industry would have required large amounts of imported tin and copper in order to function, since there are no tin and only insignificant copper deposits known on the island.(15)"(ibid., p.58)

[quote] Writings in the Ur-III period describe Meluhha as the 'land of the black mountains'. Almost all scholars suggest that Meluhha was the Sumerian name for the Indus Valley Civilization. Finnish scholars Asko and Simo Parpola identify Meluhha (earlier variant Me-lah-ha) from earlier Sumerian documents with Dravidian mel akam "high abode" or "high country". Many items of trade such as wood, minerals, and gemstones were indeed extracted from the hilly regions near the Indus settlements. They further claim that Meluhha is the origin of the Sanskrit mleccha, meaning "barbarian, foreigner".(Parpola, Asko; Parpola, Simo (1975).

This article of 2010 had present rebus readings of inscriptions on the following two tin ingots.



60
Tin ingots in the Museum of Ancient Art of the Municipality of Haifa, Israel (left #8251, right #8252). The ingots each bear two inscribed “Cypro-Minoan markings”. (Note: I have argued that the inscriptions were Meluhha hieroglyphs (Indus or Sarasvati writing) denoting ranku ‘antelope’ (on left ingot) ranku ‘liquid measure’ (on right ingot) datu ‘cross’ read rebus as: ranku 'tin' dhatu 'ore'.
Another tin ingot with comparable Indus writing has been reported by Artzy:
Fig. 4 Inscribed tin ingot with a moulded head, from Haifa (Artzy, 1983: 53). (Michal Artzy, 1983, Arethusa of the Tin Ingot, Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, BASOR 250, pp. 51-55) https://www.academia.edu/5476188/Artzy-1983-Tin-Ignot This figure indicates the head of a woman as a hieroglyph. Some scholars have suggested that this signifies Arethusa.
The author Michal Artzy (opcit., p. 55) who showed these four signs on the four tin ingots to E. Masson who is the author of Cypro-Minoan Syllabary. Masson’s views are recorded in Foot Note 3: “E. Masson, who was shown all four ingots for the first time by the author, has suggested privately that the sign ‘d’ looks Cypro-Minoan, but not the otherthree signs.”
If all the signs are NOT Cypro-Minoan Syllabary, what did these four signs, together, incised on the tin ingots signify?
The two hieroglyphs incised which compare with the two pure tin ingots discovered from a shipwreck in Haifa, the moulded head can be explained also as a Meluhha hieroglyphs without assuming it to be the face of goddess Arethusa in Greek tradition: Hieroglyph: mũhe ‘face’ (Santali) Rebus: mũh ‘ingot’ (Santali). The three hieroglyphs are: ranku 'antelope' Rebus: ranku 'tin' (Santali) ranku 'liquid measure' Rebus: ranku 'tin' (Santali). dāṭu = cross (Te.); dhatu = mineral (Santali) Hindi. dhāṭnā ‘to send out, pour out, cast (metal)’ (CDIAL 6771). [The 'cross' or X hieroglyph is incised on both ingots.]
All these hieroglyphs on the three tin ingots of Haifa are read rebus in Meluhha: Hieroglyph: ranku = liquid measure (Santali) Hieroglyph: raṅku m. ʻa species of deerʼ Vās., rankuka id., Śrīkaṇṭh.

Hieroglyph: mũh 'a face' Rebus: mũh, 'ingot' or muhã 'quantity of metal produced at one time from the furnace’ (Santali) Indus Script hypertexts thus read: Hieroglyphs: ranku 'liquid measure' or raṅku ʻa species of deerʼ PLUS dāṭu = cross rebus: plain text: ranku 'tin' PLUS dhatu 'cast mineral' Thus, together, the plain text reads: tin mineral casting. The fourth ingot with the hieroglyph of a moulded head reads: mũh 'a face' Rebus: mũh, 'ingot' or muhã 'quantity of metal produced at one time from the furnace’ (Santali). Thus, together, the message on the three tin ingots discovered in the Haifa shipwreck is: ranku dhatu mũh 'tin mineral-ore ingot'.
A challenge for researchers and students of civilization studies is to narrate the economic history of Bharat of R̥ gveda times because the nation was the richest among all nations of the globe ca.0 CE.
It is an emphatic fact that R̥ gveda has been composed on the banks of River Sarasvati. Archaeological attestation comes from sites such as Bhirrana, Kunal which take the roote of Hindu civilization to ca. 8th millennium BCE and sites such as Binjor and Kalibangan which evidence performance of Soma Yajña; and Bhirrana/Kunal dated from ca. 8th millennium BCE with continuous, unbroken settlement history. A famous potsherd of Bhirrana shows the Indus Script hypertext of a dance step of a dancing girl shown on a cire perdue bronze image of Mohenjo-daro, establishing the essential unity of over 2000 sites on the basin of Vedic River Sarasvati.
meḍ 'dance step' rebus; meḍ 'iron' (Mu.Ho.); med 'copper' (Slavic) kola 'woman' rebus:kolhe 'smelter' kol 'working in iron'
There are over 8000 Indus Script inscriptions which constitute the documentary evidence from ca. 4th millennium BCE (Earliest potsherd with writing is dated to ca. 3300 BCE from Harappa, HARP). For significance of akṣa, the spoked wheel hypertext of Bhirrana (ca. 2500 BCE), see: the key word akṣa 'wheel' rebus: akṣa 'gold' a measure of wealth. Hence, अक्ष -

Three major sources of wealth of ancient Bharat which were harnessed by farming communities and smithy guilds were: 1. textiles; 2. woods from trees, farm products; and 3. metalwork. In metalwork which require an industrial scale of production, the guild organization with shared commonwealth was the key to explain the reality that Bharat of 1 CE contributed to 33% of World GDP in 1 CE (pace Angus Maddison).

Production of textiles of cotton, silk, jute, domestication of farming, metalwork constitute principal sources of wealth of Sarasvati Civilization. Of these sources, the metalwork wealth accounting ledgers and metalwork catalogues are available on over 8000 Indus Script inscriptions.
Today, India is the second largest producer of man-made fibres in the world, providing direct employment to over 35 million people. A major fibre produced is cotton which accounts for 60% of Indian textile industry. Other fibres produced in India include silk, jute, wool, and man-made fibers. India is first in global jute production and shares 63% of the global jute textile and garment market. Weaving and the spinning of cotton find mention in R̥ gveda and evidence from the archaeological sites of Sarasvati Civilization. Sericulture and Silk Sector: India is the 2nd largest producer of silk in the world. India produces 18% of the world's total silk. Mulberry, Eri, Tasar, and Muga are the main types of silk produced in the country. A block printed and resist-dyed fabrics, whose origin is from Gujarat is found in tombs of Fostat, Fustat, also Fostat, Al Fustat, Misr al-Fustat and Fustat-Misr, iss the first capital of Egypt under Muslim rule, built by the Muslim general 'Amr ibn al-'As immediately after the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 641 CE. Large quantity of north Indian silk were traded through the silk route in China. http://www.textileasart.com/weaving.htm Woolen Sector: India is the 7th largest producer of the wool in the world.

Indigo and brownish-purple dyes for cotton textiles
"Across Eastern Indonesia the two major natural dyes that have been traditionally used on cotton are indigo and morinda, especially with regard to making ikat. Because both dyes have a low substantivity on cotton, it is possible to produce a wide range of shades ranging from light to dark. These two major dyes have been supplemented by a huge range of minor dyes, including sappan, brazilwood, kayu kuning, tamarind, and turmeric." http://www.asiantextilestudies.com/cotton.html
Moringa tinctoria plant known as aal or Indian mulberry is extensively cultivated in India in order to make the morindone dye sold under the trade name "Suranji". Morindone is used for the dyeing of cotton, silk and wool in shades of red, chocolate or purple. The colouring matter is found principally in the root bark and is collected when the plants reach three to four years of age...The active substance is extracted as the glucoside known as morindin that upon hydrolysis produces the dye. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morinda_tinctoria

Evidence for cotton, Sarasvati Civilization
1. Marshall writes (Mohenjo-daro, p. 585): "This fragment of cloth was submitted to Mr. james Turner, Director of the Technological Research Laboratory, Bombay, for examination, who remarks in his preliminary report that 'The fibre was exceedingly tender and broke under very small stresses. However, some preparations were obtained revealing the convoluted structure characteristic of cotton. All the fibres examined were completely penetrated by fungal hyphae. The appearance of once of the convoluted fibres is shown in the accompanying photograph."
2. Fragment with fabric impression, Harappa. A terracotta fragment with fabric impression from Trench 54 provides clues on the types of weaving carried out by the ancient Harappans.
3. The earliest evidence of textiles at Harappa goes back to about 3300 BCE, and is another suggestion of how important this product must have been to the later Indus economy.
4. Textile impressions on a toy bed made during the Harappan Phase (c. 2600-1900 BCE) show finely woven cloth made of uniformly spun threads. This example shows a fairly tightly woven normal weave.



78
"Farmers in the Indus valley were the first to spin and weave cotton. In 1929 archaeologists recovered fragments of cotton tetiles at Mohenjo-Daro, in what is now Pakistan, dating to between 3250 and 2750 BCE. Cottonseeds founds at nearby Mehrgarh have been dated to 5000 BCE. Literary references further point to the ancient nature of the subcontinent's cotton industry. The Vedic scriptures, composed between 1500 and 1200 BCE allude to cotton spinning and weaving . . .." So goes a remarkable new book, Empire of Cotton A Global History by Sven Beckert, which traces the development of the cotton industry in depth. Shown above are the fragments of cotton fibers so identified by Marshall, Mohenjo-daro and the Indus Civilization, p. 585), and examples of weaves whose imprints have been found since at Harappa. Empire of Cotton goes on to show how the cotton industry, which India dominated in the early 18th century, was taken over by the British, how it spurred the slave trade with the Americas and the industrial revolution, its role a century in the independence movement and Gandhi's spinning wheel, and how it once again returned to Asia in a big way at the end of the 20th century. Though very little in the book has directly to do with the Indus civilization, it is a great example of how a single material and its exploitation can have such great impact on history; it is highly likely that the development of textile crafts were a key component of the Indus civilization's rise as well.
