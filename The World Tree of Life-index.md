The World Tree of Life
In the middle of the Garden of Paradise, the Tree of Life is
standing. Picture 1 and 3 are two attempts to show the "Asgaard"
in the North mythology, where the Tree of Life "Ask Yggdrasil" is
standing. Of course, the story of Creation in the Bible and
elsewhere is very similar and familiar to many people all over the
World.
Picture 1 shows the northern Milky Way contours. Picture 2 is a
drawing of the unfolded southern and northern Milky Way
Contours. The left Tree represents the centre of our Galaxy and
the right Tree represents the celestial centre point. Picture 3 is a
Swedish rock carving showing the 2 Trees and the Milky Way
contours, in this occasion as a so called "Ship", as where in other
occasions the Milky Way figure is carved as a Man and Woman or



as male and female animals.
The first Man and Woman. Picture 1 is a Danish stone from the
Stone Age. The animated picture is a part of a Rock Carving
stone, also from Denmark, and the 3 picture is from Egypt.



4 Different rock carvings and a sketched picture of the Tree of
Life. Pictures 1 and 2 is Swedish rock carvings. Picture 3 is a
sketched rock carving from Peterborough, Canada. The 4. picture
is a rock carving from UK.
Studying comparative Stories of Creation from all over the World,
one can easily find many other examples of symbols and stories
which is very similar to the pictures and the Myths on this page
about the Tree of Life.
