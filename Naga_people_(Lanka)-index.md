Naga people (Lanka)
The Naga people, also known as Cheras, among with the Yakkshas, were an ancient
tribe who once inhabitedSri Lanka. The Naga people appear until the third century BCE
as a distinct group in the early Sri Lankan chronicles as well as early Tamil literary
works.[2] In the third century BCE they started to assimilate to Tamil language, culture
and lost their separate identity.[3]
The Nagas had by the 9th century AD or probably earlier assimilated into the major
groups, the Sri Lankan Tamils and Sinhalese. Naga identity was visible in history
through persons with the name Naga added to their personal names.[4] According to
several authors they may have been aDravidian tribe.[5][6]

The Yakshas and the Nagas are depicted in the Pali epic Mahavamsa as the early
inhabitants of Lanka when Vijaya arrived in the island in 500 B.C.[a] According to
Manogaran, some scholars also "have postulated that the Yakshas and Nagas [...] are the
aboriginal tribes of Sri Lanka"[.6] Holt concludes that they were a distinct group[.2][b]
According to V. Kanakasabhai, The Oliyar, Parathavar, Maravar and Eyinar who were
widespread acrossSouth India and North-East Sri Lankaare all Naga tribes.[10]
In the Ramayana, the mythological island Lanka is been often identified with Sri Lanka.
The inhabitants of Lanka were mentioned as non humans, mainly referring to the Rakshasas and Yakshas, but also mentioning the
Nagas.[6] Indrajit, the son of Ravana was married toSulochana, a Naga princess.�[11]

History



By the time Buddhism had reached Tamilakam, the twin epics of ancient Tamil Nadu Silappatikaram (5-6th century CE) and
Manimekalai (6th century CE) were written, speaking ofNaga Nadu across the sea fromKaveripoompuharpattinam.[12]
Manimekalai speaks of the great Naga king Valai Vanan and his queen Vasamayilai who ruled over Manipallavam, todays Nainativu,
which is also known as Nagadeepa. [13]Their daughter, the princess Pilli Valai had a liaison at Nainativu islet with the early Chola
king Killivalavan; out of this union was born Prince Tondai Eelam Thiraiyar, who historians note was the early progenitor of the
Pallava Dynasty.[14] He went on to rule Tondai Nadu from Kanchipuram. Nainativu was referred to as Manipallavam in ancient
Tamil literature following this union. Royals of the Chola-Naga lineage would go on to rule other territory of the island,
Nagapattinam and Tondai Nadu of Tamilakam.
Cīttalai Cāttanār, the author of the Manimekalai, reflected the perception at the time that Naga Nadu was an autonomous
administrative entity, kingdom or nadu stretching across coastal districts, distinguished from the rest of the island also ruled
intermittently by Tamil kings.
The Pali work Mahavamsa and the Tamil work Manimekalai, mentions a dispute between two Naga kings, which was settled by the
Lord Buddha.[4]
Ptolemy in his 1st century map of Taprobane mentions Nagadiboi. Ptolemy mentions in 150 CE that King Sornagos (Chora Naga of
Anuradhapura), a descendant of this lineage, ruled from the early Chola capital of Uraiyur during this time.
Kaveripoompuharpattinam received many adulatory comparisons to the Naga capitaKl adiramalai in the classical period.
It is also believed they were great irrigation engineers who built water storages.[1] The Giant's Tank dam and reservoir system in
Mannar, Sri Lanka is considered by some (Such as Author, Mudaliyar C. Rajanayagam) to have been built by the Nagas based on the
extensive ruins and the presence of villages with surrounding the port with Naga name (e.g. Nagarkulam, Nagathazhvu and
Sirunagarkulam).[15]
Sri Lankan Tamil Hindus since ancient times have regarded the cobra as a divine being by the passing down of Naga traditions and
beliefs. Further, a cobra can be found entwining itself round the neck of the supreme Hindu god Shiva as the serpent-king Vasuki.
Cobras can also be found in images ofVishnu.[1][5]

Notes
a. Manogaran notes: "... there is general consensus among historians that Sinhalese settlements precededa Tmil
settlements on the island by a few centuries.["7] Manogaran also notes: "... we can only speculate that the ancestors
of the present-day Tamils were already in SriLanka when the Sinhalese began colonizing the island[."8]

b. John Holt writes that "in the early Sri Lankan chronicles as well as in the earlyaTmil literary works the Nagas appear
as a distinct group".[2] Holt also writes that "the adoption of the Tamil language was helping the Nagas in the Tamil
chiefdoms to be assimilated into the major ethnic group there["9.]
