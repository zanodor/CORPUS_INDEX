A small essay about stables surrounded by cows
depicted in two Jemdet Nasr cylinder seals
Number 1
There are a number of seals from the Jemdet Nasr period that depict different buildings: temples made of stone and houses made of reed. Of course the question arises why are these buildings engraved on these seals, what meaning do they have and what is done in them. We begin this modest study with this imprint of a reed house surrounded by cows, similar scenes can still be seen in today's Near East.
Number 2
A reed structure with cows in Iraq./



Number 1
Stable
In the first place, I think that the reed house with its protruding stakes resembles the cuneiform sign for ‘stall’:
This sign means: ‘Tur’, which can be translated as: ‘animal stall’.
tur [STALL] (277x: ED IIIb, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. tur3; e2tur3 ’animal stall’ Akk. tarbaşu
[1] tur3
http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/nepsd-frame.html
Unfortunately, this word is not often used in the Sumerian texts, but cattle-pens are mentioned many times. If we want to understand the imprint then we must assume that the same things happen in these cattle-pens as in the stalls.
Nevertheless, it is evident that the stall on the imprint may have been called: ‘House with numerous perfect oxen’:
The temple hymns O E-gud-du-šar (House with numerous perfect oxen) of holy nir stone in which its sovereign sits, raising a magnificent door decoration for the princely son, whose best fine oil is holy and well-prepared, Ĝa-bura (Chamber of bowls), holy cattle-pen pasturing cows with munzer plants, your prince is a great wild bull, an elephant rejoicing in its own strength, a wild cow growing horns and and delighting in its shining horns. The incantation priest of opposed languages who put clouds in the sky, the storm which roars in the sky, as the sunlight giving ...... to the earth, Ningublaga, the son of Nanna, has erected a house in your precinct, O Ki-abrig, and taken his seat upon your dais.

Number 1
Stable
A cattle-pen is of course dwelling-place and according to the next text it is even an august royal dwelling-place:
An ululumama to Suen for Ibbi-Suen
‘Canal inspector, prince on the dais, prince with life-giving divine powers! There shall be no end to the butter and the milk of the cow in the cattle-pen -- the shrine Urim, which you have chosen in your heart, the august royal dwelling-place’.
They were also places were calves were born:
Enlil in the E-kur
Without the Great Mountain Enlil, Nintur would not kill, she would not strike dead; no cow would drop its calf in the cattle-pen, no ewe would bring forth a ...... lamb in its sheepfold.
The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
This goes without saying for us too, but for the Sumerians the significance of cows and cattle-pens went far beyond that: for instance, king Šulgi writes that he is a wild bull, he is engendered by a breed-bull, and born from a cow, he is resting amid butter and milk and he is reared in the cow-pen:
A praise poem of Šulgi
I am the king, a wild bull of acknowledged strength, a lion with wide-open jaws! I am Šulgi, a wild bull of acknowledged strength, a lion with wide-open jaws! I am a great storm let loose from heaven, sending its splendour far and wide! I am good stock, with brindled body, engendered by a breed-bull! I am a king born from a cow, resting amid butter and milk! I am the calf of a thick-necked white cow, reared in the cowpen!’
The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
Which king would say something similar today? Šulgi even writes that he is bullcalf born in the cattle-pen of abundance:
A praise poem of Šulgi
Shepherd Šulgi, great bull with splendid limbs, dragon with a lion's eyes! Bull-calf born in the cattle-pen of abundance, thriving there!
The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
So, here it is: the cattle-pen is a place where calves and kings are born and it also provides abundance.



Number 1
Stable
So, when numerous cow-pens will be erected and many sheepfolds renewed then the people will lie down in safe pastures, enjoying abundance:
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple ‘On your behalf, numerous cow-pens will be erected and many sheepfolds renewed! The people will lie down in safe pastures, enjoying abundance under you. The eyes of Sumer and all the countries will be directed toward you. An will elevate your house of Anzud for you.’
The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
And make no mistake: abundance is butter, fish, birds, births, copper and gold:
An ululumama to Suen for Ibbi-Suen
‘There shall be no end to the butter and the milk of the cow in the cattle-pen -- the shrine Urim, which you have chosen in your heart, the august royal dwelling-place, the encouragement of the Land! It shall have an abundance of butter, fish, birds, births, copper and gold!’
The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
So, even butter and cream are very important, they are that valuable that they are linked to the goddess Nisaba:
A hymn to Nisaba
‘O Nisaba, good woman, fair woman, woman born in the mountains! Nisaba, may you be the butter in the cattle-pen, may you be the cream in the sheepfold, may you be keeper of the seal in the treasury, may you be a good steward in the palace, may you be a heaper up of grain among the grain piles and in the grain stores!’

Number 1
40 60 40
Circles, representing numbers, are attached to the three stakes on top of the stable. The six circles represent number 60 and each of the two clusters of four circles represent number 40. These numbers in turn are related to deities: number 60 to Anu, the god of heaven, and number 40 to Enki, the Lord of the earth.
Drill holes represent numbers: one drill hole represents number 10; two drill holes represent number 20 and three drill holes number 30. Numbers on their turn are related to deities: number 10 to the Nusku or Adad, number 20 to the Sun-God Utu/Shamash and number 30 to the Moon-God Nanna/Suen:
‘The first hint that a cryptographic number system was applied to the Great Gods came with the discovery that the names of the Gods Suen, Shamash, and Ishtar were sometimes substituted in the texts by the numbers 30, 20, and 15, respectively. The highest unit of the Sumerian sexagesimal system - 60 - was assigned to Anu; Enlil ‘was’ 50; Enki, 40; and Adad, 10. The number 10 and its six multiples within the prime number 60 were thus assigned to male deities, and it would appear plausible that the numbers ending with 5 were assigned to the female deities. From this, the following cryptographic table emerges:’
Male: 60 - Anu, 50 -Enlil, 40 - Ea/Enki, 30 - Nanna/Suen, 20 - Utu/Shamash, 10 Iškur /Adad Female: 55 - Antu, 4.5 - Ninlil, 35 - Ninki, 25 -Ningal, 15 - Inanna/Ishtar, 5 – Ninhursag
http://www.rulit.net/books/the-12th-planet-read-299421-25.html
It is obvious that the imprint depicts two stakes with four circles: one may be related to Enki and the other one of his wives, Ninhursag (Lady Mountain) or Ninmah (Lady Great) as on cylinder seals both spouses have the same number.



Number 1
E-ana
There are 12 cows on this imprint and it is therefore natural to assume that this whole scene takes place in Taurus. The surprising thing is, that in Mesopotamia this constellation was associated with Anu, the god of heaven, for it was called ‘the heavenly steer’, ‘the crown of Anu’:
1 The heavenly steer (GU4.AN.NA), the god of the (wooden)-tablet (GISH)Le, the Crown of Anu. [Taurus, the steer]
http://www.oocities.org/astrologymulapin/pathofthemoon.htm
The pole with the six circles, symbolizing number 60, indicates that the stable is indeed related to Anu. So, it is not unreasonable to suppose that the stable is called ‘E-ana’: ‘House of heaven’.
Moreover, this ‘House’ turns out to be associated to Taurus, because according to ‘the temple hymns’ it is a shrine built for the bull:
The temple hymns
O house with the great divine powers of Kulaba, ......, its platform has made the great shrine flourish. Green fresh fruit, marvellous, filled with ripeness, descending from the centre of heaven, shrine built for the bull, E-ana (House of heaven), house with seven corners, with seven fires lifted at night-time, surveying seven pleasures (?), your princess is on the pure horizon. Your lady Inana who ......, who adorns the woman and covers the man's head with a cloth, the one with a lustrous ...... suḫ crown, the dragon of Niĝin-ĝar, the queen of heaven and earth, Inana, has erected a house in your precinct, O E-ana, and taken her seat upon your dais. 11 lines: the house of Inana in Unug.
The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
It has seven corners, seven fires and seven pleasures and this number seven is related to Pleiades, a ‘small’ constellation in Taurus: obviously this house is situated in this constellation.



Number 1
E-an-ki
But the other two posts indicate Enki and his wife Ninhursag. Enki literally means ‘Lord Earth’. Nevertheless, in practice he is mainly the lord of the waters that are present in the earth. He is therefore equal to the water god Ea (literally: ‘House Water’).
And, believe it or not, according to the next table this Ea is the presiding deity of the ‘Month of the Bull,’ that is, the ‘Month of Taurus’.

So, the reed house is linked to the Pleiades as well as to Taurus and it belongs to both Anu and Enki who appear to be linked to the same constellations. So both Anu and Enki dwell in this reed house which is a good reason to call this it: ‘E-an-ki’: ‘House of heaven and earth’. Nevertheless, the E-an-ki will no doubt be the residence of Anu and his wife Urash, who is the goddess of earth.



Number 1
Enki Anu Ninḫursag/Ninmah
Besides all this, it appears that Enki is indeed very much related to Taurus, because he is engendered by a bull and begotten by a wild bull:
Enki and the world order
Grandiloquent lord of heaven and earth, self-reliant, Father Enki, engendered by a bull, begotten by a wild bull, cherished by Enlil, the Great Mountain, beloved by holy An, king, meš tree planted in the Abzu, rising over all lands; great dragon who stands in Eridug, whose shadow covers heaven and earth, a grove of vines extending over the Land, Enki, lord of plenty of the Anuna gods, Nudimmud, mighty one of the E-kur, strong one of heaven and earth! Your great house is founded in the Abzu, the great mooring-post of heaven and earth. Enki, from whom a single glance is enough to unsettle the heart of the mountains; wherever bison are born, where stags are born, where ibex are born, where wild goats are born, in meadows ......, in hollows in the heart of the hills, in green ...... unvisited by man, you have fixed your gaze on the heart of the Land as on split reeds.
The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
And he stood up full of lust like a rampant bull:
Enki and the world order
After he had turned his gaze from there, after Father Enki had lifted his eyes across the Euphrates, he stood up full of lust like a rampant bull, lifted his penis, ejaculated and filled the Tigris with flowing water. He was like a wild cow mooing for its young in the wild grass, its scorpion-infested cow-pen. The Tigris ...... at his side like a rampant bull. By lifting his penis, he brought a bridal gift. The Tigris rejoiced in its heart like a great wild bull, when it was born ....... It brought water, flowing water indeed: its wine will be sweet. It brought barley, mottled barley indeed: the people will eat it. It filled the E-kur, the house of Enlil, with all sorts of things. Enlil was delighted with Enki, and Nibru was glad.
The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
He filled the Tigris with flowing water, and this river, on his turn, rejoiced in its heart like a great wild bull. (In the Near East the rivers start rising in March because of the melting of the snow in the mountains. In the Jemdet Nasr period, so 5000 - 4800 years ago, the sun then passed through Taurus, and as everyone and everything was affected by this constellation which meant that heaven, earth and the rivers were called bulls or cows.)



Number 1
Enki Anu Ninḫursaĝa
It appears that An(u) and Enki are related to each other as Enki is the son of the god of heaven:
The lament for Eridug
My king, you must not be distressed, you must not be anxious. Father Enki, you must not be distressed, you must not be anxious. Son of An, return your heart to your Ki-ur and your attention to your city. Living in an alien city is miserable -- return your attention to your city. Living in an alien house is miserable -- return your attention to your house. What can anyone compare with this city?
The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
And the spouse of Enki is Lady Ninhursag, (which means: ‘Lady Mountain’):
hursaĝ [MOUNTAIN] (598x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. hur-saĝ; PA.DUN3 ‘mountain, foothills; steppe’ Akk. hursānu
[1] cuneiform |HI×AŠ2|.SAG hur-saĝ (hur-sag)
http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/nepsd-frame.html
They are brother and sister because they both are Anunnaki, which means that they are descendants of Anu:
The earliest known usages of the term Anunnaki come from inscriptions written during the reign of Gudea (c. 2144–2124 BC) and the Third Dynasty of Ur. In the earliest texts, the term is applied to the most powerful and important deities in the Sumerian pantheon: the descendants of the sky-god An. This group of deities probably included the ‘seven gods who decree’: An, Enlil, Enki, Ninhursag, Nanna, Utu, and Inanna.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anunnaki
So, the numbers on the stall indicate three members of one family: Father An and his son Enki and his daughter Ninhursag. It speaks for itself that Enki and Ninhursag marry in the cattle-pen. This marriage of course is fruitful: in all they have ten children (the number of cow depicted on the above imprint, apart from the cow-heads [Enki and Ninhursag] looking outside from the stall):
Children: Ninurta, Ninsar, Abu, Nintulla (Nintul), Ninsutu, Ninkasi, Nanshe (Nazi), Azimua, Ninti, Enshag (Enshagag)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninhursag



Number 1
Enki Anu Ninḫursaĝa
On the next table we see that the poles with four or six circles look like the sign ‘Nun’:
Pictographic signs representing temple households

It can be translated as ‘object’ as well as: ‘prince’:

[1] nun
http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/nepsd-frame.html



Number 1
Enki Anu Ninḫursaĝa
The case is that several times Enki is called ‘prince’:
Enki and the world order
The Anuna gods address affectionately the great prince who has travelled in his Land: ‘Lord who rides upon the great powers, the pure powers, who controls the great powers, the numberless powers, foremost in all the breadth of heaven and earth; who received the supreme powers in Eridug, the holy place, the most esteemed place, Enki, lord of heaven and earth -- praise!’
The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
But Šulgi is also called: ‘the princely son of the E-kur’, (obviously the E-kur is in a way similar to the cattle-pen):
A praise poem of Šulgi
Shepherd Šulgi, when your seed was placed in the holy womb, your mother Ninsumun gave birth to you; your personal god, holy Lugalbanda, fashioned you; Mother Nintur nurtured you; An named you with a good name; Enlil lifted your head; Ninlil loved you. The princely son of the E-kur ....... The king, the holy barge which traverses the sky, Nanna, the lord ......, Suen ....... (2 lines fragmentary)
The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
And Enlil determined a princely fate for him:
An adab to Enlil for Šulgi
For his setting up the abundant sacrificial tin cups, for his having served evening meals in the dining-hall of the E-kur, Enlil determined a princely fate for the
shepherd, him who is worthy of the kingship and the lofty throne-dais, Šulgi, who is adorned with the ba garment of the en priests.
The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
And thus, the seal may have belonged to a prince, who, like Šulgi, stated that he was born in the cattle-pen of abundance.



Number 1
Enki Anu Ninḫursaĝa
Enki is a developer of the world, as he built the sheepfolds, carried out their cleaning, made the cow-pens, and brought luxury to the gods' dining places:
Enki and the world order He built the sheepfolds, carried out their cleaning, made the cow-pens, bestowed on them the best fat and cream, and brought luxury to the gods' dining places.

Besides that, he fertilizes humankind and animals: when Father Enki goes forth to the inseminated people, good seed will come forth. When he goes forth to the fecund cows, good calves will be born;
Enki and the world order When Father Enki goes forth to the inseminated people, good seed will come forth. When Nudimmud goes forth to the good pregnant ewes, good lambs will be born;
when he goes forth to the fecund cows, good calves will be born; when he goes forth to the good pregnant goats, good kids will be born.
The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
All in all, he is the lord of life:
A prayer to Enki for Ḫammu-rābi
May Lugal-Šubur place on your head the desert crown of kingship! May Enki, the lord of life, ...... life, and in the E-unir, the house of the plans of heaven and earth which rides upon all the divine powers, may he cover your priestly headdress in awe and splendour! (-) May he reward you with wisdom and intelligence! May your royal name be as something unchangeable! May Father Enki prolong the years of your life, and may he grant you lordship over every one of the foreign lands. O Ḫammurābi, my king!
The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
Reading this I think that the seal indicates that Enki is the divine father of the seal owner and that Ninhursag is his divine mother. If that is true then Anu is his divine grandfather.
So, the seal may have expressed that its owner was a prince. He was born in a stall of abundance, which may have been called: ‘E-gud-du-šar’, ‘House with numerous perfect oxen’, ‘E-ana’, ‘House of heaven’, or even E-an-ki: ‘House of Heaven and Earth’. His divine father may have been Enki and his divine mother may have been Ninhursag.



Number 3
Here is imprint of another stable. On top is a well-known knotted bundle which symbolizes the goddess Inanna.
Picture 4
I think that this knotted bundle is made of grain and not of reed as is commonly thought. It portrays Inanna as she is called ‘a shock of two-row barley’ in ‘A song of Inana and Dumuzid’:
‘Maiden, glossy mane, lovely beauty, Inana, glossy mane, lovely beauty! Maiden, mane of the ibex, ...... red deer, ...... red deer, Inana, mane of the ibex, ...... red deer, ...... red deer! Maiden, colourful as a pile of grain, fit for the king, Inana, colourful as a pile of grain, fit for Dumuzid! Maiden, you are a shock of two-row barley, fully developed in loveliness, Inana, you are a shock of two-row barley, fully developed in loveliness!’
The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
But the one on the stall is of course her symbol: .
Sud was renamed Ninlil when she married Enlil, the dominant deity of the pantheon (Civil 1983). Nissaba also had a connection to the netherworld. In one Babylonian poem she was called ‘Mistress of the Underworld.’ Her symbol was a sheaf or an ear of grain.

Number 3
Inanna Dumuzid
The house for Inanna is called ‘E-ana’ (House of heaven):
The temple hymns
O house with the great divine powers of Kulaba, ......, its platform has made the great shrine flourish. Green fresh fruit, marvellous, filled with ripeness, descending from the centre of heaven, shrine built for the bull, E-ana (House of heaven), house with seven corners, with seven fires lifted at night-time, surveying seven pleasures (?), your princess is on the pure horizon. Your lady Inana who ......, who adorns the woman and covers the man's head with a cloth, the one with a lustrous ...... suḫ crown, the dragon of Niĝin-ĝar, the queen of heaven and earth, Inana, has erected a house in your precinct, O E-ana, and taken her seat upon your dais. 11 lines: the house of Inana in Unug.
The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
I think that the cow-heads looking outside from the stall represent Inanna and her spouse Dumuzid. That could be possible because according to a prayer Inanna is a good wild cow
A prayer to Inana for Ḫammu-rābi
Foremost among the gods, manifest, ...... his destiny! Inana, without whom An and Enlil cannot make a decision in the Land, proud one among the Anuna gods, ...... selfesteem and ......! Inana, good wild cow of the great princes, respected among ladies ......, your greatness shines forth to heaven and earth, your divine powers are ...... powers. When you speak it is the command of An, ...... named by An ....... Your divinity is pre-eminent in the throne-hall (?), your great ways are ....... With An, you give judgment on earth; with Enlil ....... 11 lines: the house of Inana in Unug.
The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
And according to a balbale Dumuzid is a wild bull:
A balbale (?) to Inana
‘Make the milk yellow for me, my bridegroom, make the milk yellow for me, and I will drink the milk with you, my bridegroom! Wild bull Dumuzid, make the milk yellow for me, and I will drink the milk with you, my bridegroom! ...... the goat's milk ...... the fold; lord (?) of all things, fill my holy churns. Dumuzid, ...... camel's milk. The milk of the camels ....... Their butter and milk are sweet, ....... Lord Dumuzid, ...... I will drink the milk with you.’
The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
So, the two cow-heads may indeed represent the two deities.



Number 3
Inanna Dumuzid
According to a song Inana goes to Dumuzid in the cattle-pen.
A song of Inana and Dumuzid
The young lady, the king's kohl, Inana, Dumuzid's kohl, full of joy, adorned with loveliness, goes to the shepherd in the sheepfold, goes to Dumuzid in the cattle-pen. There on the road she ...... the shepherd, the maiden Inana meets him on the path.

And when she enters it, it indeed will rejoice over her and it may produce butter and milk for Dumuzid:
A balbale to Inana Lady, when you enter the cattle-pen, Inana, the cattle-pen indeed will rejoice over you. Mistress, when you enter the sheepfold, Inana, the sheepfold indeed will rejoice over you. When you enter the feeding-pen, healthy ewes will spread out their wool for you. May your spouse, Ama-ušumgal-ana, ...... on (?) your holy breast. May the holy sheepfold produce plentiful supplies of butter (?) for you. It will make butter plentiful (?), it will make milk plentiful (?), thus making you joyous, Inana. May the holy sheepfold make the butter extensive (?) for you, thus making you joyous, Ninegala. For the king you have chosen with your heart, for Dumuzid, the son of Enlil, may the cattle-pen produce (?) butter and milk, may the sheepfold produce (?) abundance! May the days of the true shepherd be numerous! The true shepherd, Dumuzid ...... days of prosperity! A balbale of Inana.
The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
So here it is said that the entry of the goddess alone causes joy and abundance. Then Dumuzid as a wild bull stands in prayer before Inanna. He is gentle towards her, he embracing her and treats her gently:
A song of Inana and Dumuzid
...... and smeared milk and honey on it. The youth is gentle towards his spouse; the wild bull stands in prayer before her. He is gentle towards holy Inana. Embracing ......, he treats her gently. Dumuzid stands in prayer before her.
The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
This obviously is a love song. Nevertheless, it also reads that Dumuzid stands in prayer before the goddess, which really gives the impression that their love has a religious impact.



Number 3
Inanna Dumuzid
In another song Dumuzid and Nisaba went to the cattle-pen, the house of (?) heaven and earth and they were living in that dwelling abundance filled the cattle-pen:
A song of Inana and Dumuzid
Then the shepherd went out into the desert. The young man Dumuzid ...... in the cattle-pen. His sister, the queen of scribes, went to ...... heaven and earth. The
shepherd and his sister entered there into the holy sheepfold inside which the sheep live. He was living there, the shepherd was living there; and his sister, the singer expert in song, was living in that dwelling. Abundance filled the cattle-pen, plenty flowed in the sheepfold. They ate, they ate pure food -- pressed oil, honey and ghee. They drank emmer beer and strong liquor.
The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
Again, when two gods enter the cattle-pen it is filled with abundance, as said before, Nisaba herself may be the butter and the cream:
A hymn to Nisaba Nisaba, may you be the butter in the cattle-pen, may you be the cream in the sheepfold.
The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
Then Inanna and Dumuzid make love in this cattle-pen:
A song of Inana and Dumuzid The young lady, the king's kohl, Inana, Dumuzid's kohl, full of joy, adorned with loveliness, goes to the shepherd in the sheepfold, goes to Dumuzid in the cattle-pen. There on the road she ...... the shepherd, the maiden Inana meets him on the path. Dumuzid comes forth like the daylight. ...... extended his hand to .......
The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
And when two deities make love then it surely is fruitful and children will be engendered. These children later they will be born in the cattle-pen of abundance, just like Šulgi:
A praise poem of Šulgi
O my king, great bull with splendid limbs, dragon with a lion's eyes! Shepherd Šulgi, great bull with splendid limbs, dragon with a lion's eyes! Bull-calf born in the cattlepen of abundance, thriving there!
The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature



Number 3
So, cattle-pens were places where deities came together and made love and caused abundance, but they were also delivery rooms were calves and kings were born. This means that the seal of the above imprint may have belonged to a king who was engendered and born in the stable of abundance. His divine mother may have been Inanna and his divine father may have been Dumuzid.
I end this essay with something unexpected, in a praise poem Lipit-Eštar writes that he is a human god:
A praise poem of Lipit-Eštar
I am Lipit-Eštar, king of the Land. I am the good shepherd of the black-headed. I am the foremost in the foreign countries, and exalted in the Land. I am a human god, the lord of the numerous people. I am the strong heir of kingship.
The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
As a god he makes an abundant crop grow, makes butter and milk abundant in the cow-pen, makes fish and birds in grow bigger and he is a river of plenty bringing flowing water etc. etc.
I am he who makes an abundant crop grow, the life of the Land. I am a farmer, piling up his grain piles. I am a shepherd making butter and milk abundant in the cow-pen. I am he who makes the fish and birds grow bigger in the marshes. I am a river of plenty, bringing flowing water.
The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
So, here it turns out that a king, being a human god, causes the abundance of the land. Is there a king running around these days who can achieve something similar?



Number 3
Šulgi also filled with abundance the temple of Suen, a cow-pen which yields plenty of fat, he has slaughtered oxen there and offered sheep:
A praise poem of Šulgi
I entered the E-kiš-nu-ĝal like a mountain kid hurrying to its habitation, when Utu spreads broad daylight over the countryside. I filled with abundance the temple of Suen, a cow-pen which yields plenty of fat. I had oxen slaughtered there; I had
sheep offered there lavishly. I had šem and ala drums resound there and caused tigi drums play there sweetly. I, Šulgi, who makes everything abundant, presented foodofferings there and, like a lion, spreading fearsomeness from (?) the royal offeringplace, I bent down (?) and bathed in flowing water; I knelt down and feasted in the Egal-maḫ of Ninegala.

So, this is way this king makes everything abundant.
