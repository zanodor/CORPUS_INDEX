Azhdaha
Azhdaha, Azhdahak, Ezhdeha (Persian: اژدها ) or Azhdar ( اژدر ) is a
mythical creature in Iranian mythology, roughly equal to a serpent.
They are gigantic snake-like creatures living in the air, in the sea, or
on the earth. Sad dar-e nathr and sad dar-e Bondahesh, Shahnameh
and Garshaspnameh are among main principal texts that contain
information about the creature. In Persian literature, Azhdahas are
depicted as a giant snake or lizard with wings.
[1]
According to traditions, they have a huge body, a very scary face,
their mouths are wide with lots of teeth, and their eyes are bright.
Azhdahās are actually normal snakes, according to "Ajāyeb ul
Makhlooghāt", a book by Mohammad b. Mahmoud b. Ahmad-e Tusi
(wrote in 1160 AD), "when a snake lives 100 years and its length
becomes 30 Gazes, it is called an azhdahā". He also wrote that
"because of their harassment to other creatures, the God eventually
will throw them in the sea and in there, their body continue to raise,
such that their length becomes more than 10,000 Gazes (a
traditional measurement unit roundly equal to a meter). Then in the
sea, they evolve to have two wings, like a fish, and the seawave is
because of their movements. Eating the heart of an Azhdahā brings
courage and bravery. Their skins are suitable to healing the wound of
love, and if someone bury an azhdahā's head in a land, the
conditions of that land will become good."

Another work which was considerably influenced by the "Ajayeb ul
Makhlooghaat", is the "Nuzhat al-Quloob". Completed in 1339-40,
the author and historian , Hamd Allah Mustaufi Qazvini, describes
the dragon as being terrible in appearance, with flaming eyes, a wide
mouth and a huge body of enormous length.Like Ahmad- e-Tusi, he
too maintains that the dragon was at first a serpent, and it was only



after he became more than thirty yards long that he was called a
dragon. He however says that after the dragon was cast into the sea
by God, for terrorizing the people on land, it developed fins and
continued to grow in the sea. Eventually it grew so much that it
caused damage in the sea, and after it was killed, its body was cast
up on the shore to provide food for the inhabitants of the Land of
Gog and Magog.[3]
In Shahnameh, the national epic of Greater Iran, Azhdahas appear in
a number of stories. Sām, Rostam, Esfandiar, Eskandar, Bahram V
(Gur) are among the heroes that kill an azhdaha.[2]
