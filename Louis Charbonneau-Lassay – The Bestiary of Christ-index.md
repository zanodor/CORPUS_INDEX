FOREWORD
E BESTIAIRE DU CHRIST was orginally a book of a thouLivan pages and over a thousand of the author’s woodcuts. It was published in Brussels just after the outbreak of the Second World War: one of four volumes planned by Louis Charbonneau-Lassay, all pursuing his interest in religious symbolism. The others were Le Floraire du Christ, Le Vulnéraire du Christ, and Le Lapidaire du Christ. All the material was gathered for them, but he did not live to finish and publish any of the three. Le Bestiaire alone has survived, and barely. The firm of Desclée, De Brouwer et Cie. published it in a limited edition of five hundred copies, almost all of which, along with the woodblocks for the illustrations, were lost when a bomb set fire to the warehouse where they were stored. Four other printings of five hundred copies each were printed in Milan from surviving copies of the first edition. That is the entire publishing history of this extraordinary book until its present appearance. Evidently, not many people have had a chance to read it; yet the rumor of it has spread slowly, almost secretly, as if the magic of the old symbols, reinvested through the love and sensitivity of the author with the power of their ancient meanings, traveled on some unknown wavelengths to reach out, fifty-odd years later, to another audience. Bits and traces of the original book were found here and there; I knew of it long before I held a copy in my hands—and after that, slowly
but inevitably, it became necessary to pass it on to others. I



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
Who was Louis Charbonneau-Lassay? A name of importance as it must have been in his lifetime to an inner circle of “les érudits,” it was never familiar to the public, and since his death in 1946 it would be forgotten—were it not for Le Bestiaire. He led one of those remarkable unremarkable lives that are probably the reason why God does not lose patience entirely with the human race. He was born in Loudun in 1871, and lived in that west central part of France all his life, except for a few years spent at Orly, near Paris. He went to school at the monastery of the Brothers of St. Gabriel, and later of his own wish joined the novitiate of Saint-Laurent-sur-Sévre, where he pursued his training in history, art, and archaeology. He became a professor and taught at Poitiers and Moncoutant until a throat ailment prevented him from lecturing. But it did not deflect him from his search into the past, for he went into field work and the excavations of the many dolmen sites in the Loudunnaise region. In 1903 the order of St. Gabriel dissolved. Charbonneau had never taken permanent vows, and although he remained all his life a devoted and convinced Catholic, he was now well launched on what was to be his life work and was receiving honors and recognition as an archaeologist and a historian, and it was in this way rather than as a monk that he chose to serve his religion. In 1933, already in his sixties, he married and moved to Orly where he took full advantage of the libraries and museums of Paris. He was an active member of various historical, archaeological, and religious groups, wrote papers for learned journals, including Aélantis and Etudes Traditionelles, and edited one himself: Rayonnement Intellectual, until the war loomed as a serious threat in 1939. By this time, he had returned with his ailing wife to Loudun, to a beautiful garden and a house filled with his collections of art and antiquities. Probably he looked forward to a peaceful old age preparing his books for publication. Then came the German Occupation. In Loudun, the commandant ordered all citizens to turn
over their firearms. Charbonneau trudged to headquarters with IIII



FOREWORD
a sack of some of his antique firing pieces. “I have about fifty guns in my house,” he told the astonished and suspicious officer, “but as the most recent of them is a hundred years old, I brought you some samples to see if you want them.”’ He must have had a very charming smile. He was allowed to take his guns home again; and although German troops were quartered in his house during the Occupation, not a single item of
his collections was lost or damaged. The Bestiaire appeared in 1940, and Charbonneau dedicated himself to finishing his other books and readying them for publication, but circumstances opposed him: the war, the Occupation, his wife’s ill health and his own. Mme. Charbonneau died during the war, which he survived by only a year. Never robust, he fought his increasing frailty in unsuccessful efforts to finish his other books. He died the day after Christmas in
1946.
When my love affair with Le Bestiaire du Christ began, I thought it would be possible to make a much shorter book out of it that would give a sort of distillation of its essence. I have indeed omitted certain chapters and cut out many repetitions which were probably caused by the strange order in which Charbonneau-Lassay arranged, or jumbled, his creatures, and sometimes even his separate accounts of them. I have changed his arrangement considerably; anyone fortunate enough to have a copy of the original book and attempting to trace in it the path of my abridgement-translation would find
it a strenuous gymnastic exercise. I have also omitted some
of the detail of the author’s research, though including enough, I hope, so that other students may follow up his sources if they wish. But I found it was not possible to make the book as small as I had at first envisaged it. It seemed determined to be a considerable volume, one that must be taken seriously. All the notes referring to the present text have been included for the sake of the ambitious reader, and they show the astonishingly wide range of Charbonneau-Lassay’s own re- IIIIII

search, as well as. his remarkable inconsistency in checking
such details as publishing information and even authorship
(for example, I have found no one who has ever heard of a
book by Xenophon called Geoponicus; see note 1 in Part III,
“The Deer.”) Most of the references, of course, are to
French books and journals which I have not had the pos
sibility of rechecking, but wherever I could find Latin or Eng
lish titles of books or any other relevant facts, I have added
them in the bibliographical appendix. These added notes,
however, do not pretend to be complete, and I must empha
size that this work, standing firmly on its own merits, cannot
be taken for something it is not: a dependable reference book
in any scholarly or scientific sense. But unreliable as they are,
the notes may contain clues of which I haven’t wanted to de
prive the researcher.
Although I have corrected typographical errors where it
was possible, the French edition contained a great many and I
cannot guarantee the accuracy of page or file numbers in
books I was not able to check for myself. So I must share
with the author the responsibility for all errors of fact or
judgment that appear in these pages, at the same time grate
fully acknowledging the skillful and enthusiastic help I have
received from a number of people better versed than I in
their various fields. Among them are John Anthony West
whom I consulted on references to ancient Egypt; I am in
debted to him for a number of corrections and for several of
the editorial notes. Caroline Herrick and Patty Ewing investi
gated questions about ancient China, and for general research
into various obscure terms and references I am deeply grate
ful for the help of Heather Wolfe and Jane Brooks. Others
who have researched, corrected, proofread and in general
enormously helped and supported the work of this book are
Paul Jordan-Smith, Jean Sulzberger, and Rob Baker. I also
wish to thank M. le Comte Elie de Dampierre for supplying me with handbooks on the birds, animals, and insects of Eu
rope, and the Lady Devlin for information about little-known IIvV

corners of England. Above all, I want to thank Joseph Epes
Brown, Henri Tracol, and the late Monka Karasz, whose
knowledge and appreciation of Le Bestiaire were what first led
me to it. A special increment of gratitude goes to Joseph
Brown for lending me his copy of the rare first edition; he
tells me there is only one other in the United States, which
was owned by Dr. Ananda Coomaraswamy.
The chapters on the Lion and the Hippogriff were origi
nally translated by Carol Zaleski, and Gabriela Laignel and
Linda Daniel helped me with the translation of the early chap
ters, until I realized that the translating could not be sepa
rated from the editing and that both had to be done together
by the same hand. The chapter on the Sphinx appeared in
ParaBOLA, Vol. VIII, No. 2, under the title “Hieroglyph of
Life,” in Irving Friedman’s translation, and several other ex
cerpts of the present work have been seen in PARABOLA since
then: portions of the chapter on “The Man” in Vol. VIII,
No. 3, entitled “Tongues of Fire”; of “The Weasel” in Vol.
XIV, No. 1; of “The Ouroboros” in Vol. XV, No. 1, and an
excerpt from “The Horse” in Vol. XIV, No. 4. I have revised
all the translations and am ultimately responsible for any cuts
or what may be felt as liberties taken with the text.
Finally, I wish to thank the original publishers, Desclée, De
Brouwer et Cie., for their patience and cooperation in bring
ing this wonderful book back into circulation.

INTRODUCTION
@@PAKE CARE, ABOVE all, not to reveal the secrets of the
holy mysteries, and do not allow them to be indis
creetly exposed to the daylight of the profane world. ... Only
the saints—not everyone—ray lift a corner of the veil which
covers the things which are holy....OQur most saintly
founders... charged the celebration {of the mysteries] with so
many symbolic rites that what is in itself one and indivisible
can appear only little by little, as if by parts, and under an in
finite variety of details. However, this is not simply because of
the profane multitude, who must not glimpse even the cover
ing of holy things, but also because of the weakness of our
own senses and spirit, which require signs and material means to
raise them to the understanding of the immaterial and the sublime!.”
These words, attributed to St. Dionysius the Areopagite,
ate a very exact statement of the principal reasons for the use
of symbolism. It is to remedy the weakness of our nature and
to satisfy its need that all religions and mysteries have felt the
obligation to create for themselves codes of symbols kept se
cret by a strict discipline of caution. It was in this way that
the mysteries of Eleusis, of Delphi, of Ephesus and others
were protected, and the same practice held in the Mithraic
cults and in the Orphic schools. Everyone recognized not only
the danger of persecution but also the mysterious, hierarchical
authority whose validity Pythagoras affirmed with the words:
“Tt is not good to reveal everything to everyone.” VVIIII



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
In all the countries where they found themselves, the first Christians
— not finding riches enough in their own treasury of
sacred images—adapted ancient local religious symbols to their own particular beliefs; and among these, some were ded
icated to the representation of the Savior. Others lent them
selves to the expression of the great themes of Christian
spiritual life, or seemed to represent one of Christ’s perfec
tions or roles. There was little modification of the accepted
and often conventional forms; so these images of things and
of real or imaginary beings are presented in the works of the
first Christian artists exactly as one sees them in the decora
tions of temples, palaces, baths, and other major buildings of
Latium or of the Roman provinces. The dolphin in the cata
combs, now representing Christ, remained the same image
that adorned the palace mosaics and the fountains splashing in
the gardens of the Caesars’ Rome; the anchor kept the form
that it had in the temples of Neptune-Poseidon, and the cen
taur and the griffin, the hippocampus and hippogriff remained what the artists in Greece and Rome had made of them. When the early pilgrims to the holy places and the Cru
sades returned to the West after their sojourns in the Near
East and in Egypt, the stories they brought back, as well as
the works of art and the products of commerce, such as fab
rics, had a strong influence on religious and secular art in our
occidental countries. The same thing happened with the first
great world travelers who during the second half of the Mid
dle Ages penetrated into the farthest parts of Asia, to Mongolia, to China, or to the African equator. The animals, birds, trees, fruits, and minerals, the fantastic beings who filled their
tales, were taken over by the Western symbolists to represent the gifts of God and even Christ himself. Later the old symbols were to permeate all of European art and the entire heraldic code with the rich essence they contain. “For the Middle Ages,” wrote Gevaert, “the whole uni
verse was a symbol2.” “It knew that everything on earth is a sign, everything is an image, that the visible is of value only

in the measure that it covers the invisible. The medieval petiod, which consequently was not the dupe of appearances, as we are, studied very closely the science of symbolism, and made it the purveyor and servant of mysticism?.” A book which goes back to the earliest Christian times, the Physiologus, adds to the elements drawn from the old naturalists, with images borrowed from Greek and Oriental writers and from fables and myths from all parts of the world. This work remained in great favor throughout the Christian world, especially during the four or five centuries which followed the peace which Constantine granted to the Church, and a considerable number of somewhat different versions were circulated, so that we no longer know exactly what was the original text. The fourth-century Commentary of. Physiologus, attributed to St. Epiphanius, contains twenty-six chapters dedicated only to animals. Works of the same kind, in verse or prose, were composed in the Middle Ages under the name of bestiaries, or volucraries when restricted to the symbolism of birds. For plants there were florilegia, and lapidaries dealt with the miraculous properties of precious stones and minerals. Other writers on more general lines, of the same period, gave a good deal of space to the symbolic meanings of animals and objects. These various writings were truly the breviaries of the contemporary artists, and agreed so well with the spirit of the times that Richard de Fournival achieved fame by using them as a model for his Bestiary of Love. Although most of the sacred symbols of great Christian art came from ancient religions and writings and were disseminated by clerics, monks, and other lettered men, the humble country folk, in their fields and gardens, along with these learned ones and feeling with them the same need to see the Savior everywhere, chose for themselves metaphors for Christ that were entirely their own. They saw him as a child in the color of the pale-pink carnation, stained with his own blood in the crimson rose; the first swallow of spring was for them the
emblem of his Resurrection, as was also the butterfly; the gray IIXx

ass whose back is marked with the cross evoked the journey
to Calvary; lively legends connected the woodcock, the gold
finch, and the robin to his crucifixion, and the fossilized sea
urchin and certain mineral conglomerates to the Eucharist, which is Christ incarnate.
Besides these mentioned sources of inspiration, an impor
tant place must also be given to various factors which at times
found fresh interpretations for previous symbolic forms, and
even produced new ones. In the front rank of such influences
must be placed that of Gnosticism. Another is to be found in
the combined efforts of the Hebraic Kabbalah, the ritual for
mulas of demonic or superstitious practices, astrological and
divinatory sciences, alchemy in its pure form or mixed more
or less with magic, even with sorcery: which, all grouped to
gether, are commonly (though incorrectly) called hermetism
that is, the secret knowledge, because it was given only to the
few initiates. But during the Middle Ages, Christian scholars
and clerics, even saints, began to understand that there was
nothing whatever wrong in the study of anything which con
cerned nature or the properties of plants and minerals, includ
ing those branches of knowledge hitherto closed to them, such
as alchemy; or in astrology, the possible influences of atmo
spheric conditions, or of the movements and conjunctions of
the stars, on the conception and parturition of animals and
the germination of plants. Nevertheless, it must be borne in
mind that those who taught in the episcopal or monastic
schools opened their knowledge only to pupils known to be
discreet and of sound judgment, for it was not easy to discern
the boundary between what the Church allowed in this domain
and what was forbidden. Discretion was a necessity in this pe
riod when the suspicion of magic or of sorcery could lead entirely innocent people to torture and death. From the end of the twelfth century, heraldry with its secu
lar coats-of-arms had become one of the best codified creations that human intellect had achieved during medieval times.
By the middle of the thirteenth century, heraldry had its own X

precise language governed by strict rules, and its own art, also rigidly codified, which remains today one of the most prestigious in the world, and which within its unyielding framework still made room for works of astonishing variety and
marvelous zest. From its birth heraldry was penetrated and dominated by Christian iconography, principally through engravings on coins during the early Middle Ages. Heraldry repaid the debt of its adoption by Christian symbolism by finding new aspects of several of the ancient emblems, and by helping to continue the use of others which would otherwise have fallen into oblivion; and also by guarding the secret of numerous interpretations that we now can understand only by its means, so that in a sense it can very justly be said that he who studies the Christian symbolism of the Middle Ages, especially in the West, will never completely penetrate it if he is not familiar with the science, the art, and the spirit of ancient heraldry in all its various forms—that of the Church, of the nobility, and of the commercial guilds. And we can also invert this proposition, so vividly and so intimately did Christian symbolism and heraldry interpenetrate each other. Since in those days theology and heraldry ruled both sacred and profane arts, Christian emblems of vices and virtues, like those of the Trinity and of the characteristic attributes of the saints, were not applied thoughtlessly, as happened later much too often; the discipline of symbolism was effectively maintained and respected. In fact, symbols must not be considered as arbitrary. “Faithfully transmitted by tradition,” wrote Professor Hippeau in the last century, “they constituted a kind of artistic orthodoxy which did not allow them to be considered as solely a product of imagination and whim*.” We still have much to learn about the religious thought of the Middle Ages. Many of its symbolic forms are enigmas for us; we can recognize that some are the signs of heraldry, some ate workmens’ trademarks, others are decorative — and although this may be the case, it is only their outer raison XI

d’tre, their exoteric side, and they can and almost always do
have a hidden significance, which is their esoterism. Formerly
this underlying meaning was kept for only a small number of
people. There were schools “generally very exclusive and
little-known,” which were not at all schools of philosophy, and
whose teachings were conveyed only behind the veil of certain
symbols which must have been quite obscure for those who
did not have the key to them. The key was given only to
close followers of proved discretion and intelligence, who had
undertaken certain commitments. Evidently all this indicates
the presence of teachings profound enough to be totally for
eign to the ordinary way of thinking, and as this phenomenon
seems to have been fairly frequent in the Middle Ages, there
is strong reason for caution in speaking of that epochs intel
lectual attainments and for taking into account what might
have existed outside of what is known to us with certainty.
Many things must have been lost because they were not writ
ten down, which is also “the explanation for the almost total
loss of the Druidic teaching. Among the schools alluded to,
we might mention the alchemists, whose doctrine was above
all of a cosmological order. ... One might say that the sym
bols contained in alchemical writings constitute their exoterism, while their secret interpretation constitutes their
esoterism?.”
The medieval era practiced and glorified the intensive cul
ture of spirituality, and for it, all beauty was beauty only when
seen in the divine light; the value of anything was. measured
by the degree in which it favored the ascension of the soul.
But then came the Renaissance and a tragic retreat of the

tion of material beauty. “The symbolism which had been the very soul of art in the thirteenth century,” says Emile Male, “this beautiful idea that reality is but an image, that rhythm, number, and harmony are the great laws of the universe, this whole world of thought where dwelt the old theologians and the old artists, seems closed off...one feels the withering and dying of the ancient symbols®.” In fact, not all the symbols died, but many disappeared from the habitual forms of art. And above all, the true meaning of these emblems was forgotten; room was made for arbitrary interpretations and the allegorical ideas applied to some of them changed totally: for instance, the pelican, the old symbol of the purifying Christ who washes the sins of his children with his blood and so returns them to life and grace, became almost solely, in the eyes of all, an emblem of the Eucharist, because the action of purification by blood was ignorantly seen as the gesture of feeding, which belongs to the vulture in ancient Egypt. And the pelican was not the only one abused in this fashion. Symbolic representations also suffered, especially those that had not evolved from the iconography of ancient Greece and Rome. The quality of the sacred accorded them by medieval art no longer had the same value, and the symbolic animals lost their ideal character and came closer to the anatomic forms of natural beasts. All they retained were easy, stale, exoteric meanings without depth or substance, without mystery: the lion was only the image of strength and courage, the lamb of gentleness, the snake of discretion, the phoenix of immortality, the rose of beauty... and it was forgotten that in the beginning their function had been to represent Christ and his gifts on the consecrated shield of the knight. Other symbols, such as the panther, the stork, the crow, and so on, were no longer understood at all, and the angels of Paradise, the beautiful, ethereal and radiant angels of the Byzantines and the sculptures of Rheims, of Fra Angelico and
Jehan Fouquet, were changed in the churches of the Renais- XII

sance into chubby, naked cherubs; the goats, rams, doves,
storks, and cocks ceased to allude to some of the most fas
cinating aspects of Christ and became only allegories of a purely sensual and quite inferior order.
Studies of archaeology and sacred art made in the past cen
tury have restored to symbolism, for those well-read in the
subject, a part of the very high esteem due to it. It merits,
however, much greater recognition: it should be known and
understood more precisely, first of all by artists, and by all the
clergy and serious Christians, at least, since the appropriate
use of symbols offers a source of light for the understanding
and of substantial nourishment for the spirit.
OK Ok
In this work, I have tried to present the exact meanings of
symbolic images which, in the course of the Christian cen
turies and in very different places, have been taken as myste
rious representations of the person of Jesus Christ in his
various aspects. Among these ideograms there are some that
could provide material for a whole book. I have had to con
dense and to keep to the essentials of their Christian and pre
Christian history.
I have listed my sources of information, not to make a
childish display, but simply to allow the reader to go back to
these sources if he wishes. The images of the artistic exam
ples which illustrate the text in these pages were cut in
service-wood with the simple tools used by the fifteenth
century wood engravers: I have not been so presumptuous as
to aspire to a work of art, but only to hope that in spite of
their imperfections, the crude support they bring to the text
will be enough to make a better understanding possible of the passages they accompany.

THE TETRAMORPH
N THE SERIES of living beings claimed by Christian symbolism to form the mysterious crown of Christ, a group of four animals is notable for the large place it held, and continues to hold, in sacred art and in mystical literature. We see them represented at times separately from one another and at times united, blended together in the form of a unique being that would be strange indeed and disconcerting to anyone ignorant of ecclesiastical symbolism (Fig. 1). These celestial animals are the ones that the Hebrew prophet Ezekiel, towards the end of the seventh century B.C., and the evangelist St. John in the first years of the Church, saw come to life in visions, of which they have left us extraordinary and troubling accounts: the lion, the ox, the eagle, and man. They form what sacred art has named the Tetramorph, “the Four Forms.” These are the words of Ezekiel: “Now it came to pass... as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God....And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out Fig.1 Tetramorph in the Louvre Museum. 3

of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out
of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire. Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man. And every one had four faces,
and every one had four wings. And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calfs foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass. And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their
faces and their wings. Their
wings were joined one to an
Fig. 2. Ilth-century Tetramorph other; they turned not when

straight forward. As for the likeness of their faces, they four
had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right
side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side;
they four also had the face of an eagle. Thus were their faces:
and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every
one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.
And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit
was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went. As
for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was
like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it
went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire
was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning. And the 4

living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning!.” And now St. John: “And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.... And before
the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal; and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind. And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third
beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle. And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest
not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come? (Fig. 2).” In St. John, as in Ezekiel, these four animals, or rather these four “living creatures,” are the epitome of creation, be
cause of all creatures they are the noblest. We shall see how
Man, Lion, Ox (or Bull), and Eagle were taken to represent Christ symbolically and how the Christian arts placed them around him to represent the four Evangelists who have transmitted to us his story and his teaching.

whom God disclosed to the dazzled eyes of Ezekiel on the
banks of the Chebar!, and whom St. John recognized in his
resplendent vision on Patmos, when they sang before the
throne of the sovereign Lamb, beating their fiery wings: the
Lion, awesome king of the beasts; the Ox, king of sacrificial
victims; the Eagle, king of the air; and Man, king of the
world.

was, was only a servant. That is why, together with the man,
the eagle, and the ox, he stood transfixed with love and
adoration, acclaiming the One who
occupied the throne, by turns lion
and lamb; the One whom John saw ascend to the divine seat, there to
open the book sealed with seven seals?.
But many centuries before the
time that John rested his head on his
master’s heart and felt the Spirit de
scend upon him, the pre-Christian
traditions of Europe, Africa, and
Asia surrounding Israel and its reli
gion had adopted the image of the
lion to represent what they believed
to be the various attributes of divinity.

THE LION
Among the Egyptians, the goddess Sekhmet proudly bore a lion’s head (Fig. 1); among the Ammonites, the sun was adored under the name of Camos, the Lion-sun, and in Syria, as we shall see later on, the royal animal had also a divine character. For millennia, Tibet has worshipped the Ka-groMha, goddesses with the heads of lionesses, like Sekhmet of Egypt, divinely beautiful, who dance naked upon the corpses of conquered men and animals. Among the Greeks, four harnessed lions drew the chariot of Cybele, at a stirring gallop or pacing majesticallyCybele, mother of the gods, the “Good Goddess,” image of the divine bounty which gives humanity all the good things which come forth from the earth.
In Persia, the lion was one Fig. 2 The heraldic lion of Persia.
of the animals sacred to the cult of Mithra. The feasts of this god were called the “Leontic rites,” and often on the sculptures which depict Mithra sacrificing the bull, the lion and the serpent are shown lying underneath the slain animal. In the Mithraic mysteries, initiates of the Fourth Order were called “lions” and “lionesses”’; and Mithra himself, “the Invincible Sun,” seems to have been sometimes personified by a lion-headed god. Even today, the heraldic, sword-wielding lion of the Persian state bears on his back the resplendent sun (Fig. 2). In ancient Syria, the god of courage was represented by a crowned lion-centaur endowed with four lion’s paws and two human arms. The lion also lends his claws to the sphinx and his body to the griffin, giving them a part of his nature and of the qualities which are attributed to him: royalty, power, watchfulness, courage, and justice. Royalty and power: no doubt this was why Alexander the 7



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
Great, and after him, Maximilian-Hercules, Probus, Gallienus,
and other rulers, appeared on their coins hooded with the skin
of a lion’s head.
Strength and courage: over and above the Mithraic influ
ence, this accounts for the lion’s adoption as insignia by the
legions of Rome.
Watchfulness: the age-old belief, sanctioned as well by clas
sical Latin authorities, which shows the lion sleeping in the
desert with his eyes wide open, day or night, must surely have
seemed significant to the first Christian symbolists. What did
it matter to them whether the alleged facts were true or not?
St. Augustine, in commenting on a rather strange characteris
tic attributed to the eagle, tells us that in symbolism “the im
portant thing is to consider the significance of a fact and not
to dispute its authenticity?.” Thus Christian idealism of by
gone days always and in everything paid heed to the symbol
and not to the thing, to the spirit which gives life and not to
the letter which sucks dry. So it sees in the perpetually open
eyed lion the image of the attentive Christ who sees every
thing, and who guards souls from evil when they truly wish, like a watchful pastor, a good shepherd.
Here, the Far East is in agreement with the Western and
Christian Middle Ages in seeing the lion as a vigilant guard
ian. Since what long vanished epoch have granite lions,
crouched and ferocious, like those of Angkor Wat, stood
guard in the company of fearsome dragons at the threshold of
India’s temples? For the symbolists of Asia, as for those of
the West, lions and dragons never shut their eyes; they would
say, with our Brunetto Latini, “All lions of every kind keep their eyes open even while they sleep*.” William of Normandy, who wrote his Divine Bestiary at the
beginning of the thirteenth century, also underlines the sym
bolic character of the watchful lion, and gives the following
interpretation:
8



THE LION
Quer quant il dort, li oil When the lion sleeps, his eye veille; watches; En dormant a les euz overz, In sleep his eyes are open, Et clers et luisanz et apers. Clear and gleaming and awake.
Now, he adds, we must understand what this means:
Quand cest lion fut en croiz When this lion was put on the mis cross Par les Ieves, ses anemis, By the Jews, his enemies, Qui le jugiérent a grant tort, Who judged him so wrongfully, L’umanité i soffrit mort His humanity suffered death then Quand l’espérit de cors When he rendered the spirit rendi from the body, En la saincte croiz s’endormi; And fell asleep on the holy cross; Si que la deité veilla. But the divine nature kept watch.
And here the ancient poet is in accord with St. Hilary and St. Augustine who see, in the lion’s way of sleeping, an allusion to Christ’s divine nature which was not extinguished in the sepulcher, even while his humanity underwent a real death. Justice: for the Ancients used to say that the lion will attack his prey only if he is compelled by an urgent need for food, and that, even then, he will never pounce upon a foe who has fallen before the battle can begin. It was also said that the lion knew how to show appreciation for a favor, to the point where he might teach humans some useful lessons in gratitude. The Middle Ages maintained the connections which had previously linked the lion to the idea of justice. From Italy up to the Loire, ecclesiastical courts were often held in the forecourts of churches between stone lions which framed the portal, and judgments were handed down there in accordance with the well-known expression inter leones et coram populo: “between the lions and before the assembled people.” One can still see one of these forecourts of justice, flanked by weather-beaten lions, at the grand portal of the church of St.
Radegund in Poitiers, and lions appear again at the threshold 9



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
of several ancient churches in Rome, at St. Lawrence-outside
the-Walls, at the Church of the Twelve Apostles, at St.
Lawrence-in-Lucina, and at St. Saba.
The concept which links the lion to the virtue of justice is
supported in Christian symbolism by the Bible’s description of
Solomon’s throne of justice, made of ivory and gold, which
rested on six steps guarded by twelve magnificent lions’.
The lion was also an emblem of the Resurrection. Emile Male ex
plains a stained glass window in
the cathedral of Bourges which
shows a symbolic lion near the
tomb of the risen Christ, by re
calling the tradition which made the lion, in Christian art, an em
blem of Christ as the risen GodMan.® Male writes, “In the Middle
: : | Ages, everyone subscribed to the
Fig. 3. The lion bringing its cub idea that the lioness brought forth
back to life, 13th century. young which appeared to be still
born. For three days the lion cubs would give no sign of life,
but on the third day, the lion would return and animate them
with his breath (Fig. 3).”
The authors of the bestiaries of the Middle Ages certainly
found this legend in Aristotle and in Pliny the Elder; yet Plu
tarch, better informed about the Orient and its creatures, had
written that, on the contrary, lion cubs come into the world
with their eyes wide open; and for that reason, certain peoples
of his time consecrated the lion to the sun”. (This would also
explain the lion’s presence alongside Mithra, the Sol Invictus.)
Although Cuvier and the modern naturalists confirm Plutarch’s
opinion, the authors and artists of the Middle Ages, relying
on the scant authority of Origen® and of the Physiologus, fol
lowed the opposite view. In such a thoroughly idealistic world,
which sought to consecrate every truth by means of symbols,
the fable of the lion cubs born dead and brought to life on 1100



THE
the third day by their father enjoyed a great vogue; it was favored by St. Epiphanius, St. Anselm, St. Ivo of Chartres, St. Bruno of Asti and many others®. As Male puts it, “The apparent death of the little lion represented the sojourn of Jesus Christ in the grave, and his birth was like an image of the Resurrection!®.” William of Normandy, in his Divine Bestiary, might be translated as follows:
Quant la femele foone Le foon chiet a terre mort; De vivre n’aura ia confort Tusque li pere, au tierz itor Le souffle et leche par amor;
En tel maniere le respire
Ne porreit aveir autre mire
Autresi fu de Thesu-Christ L’umanité que por nos prist, Que por V’amor de nos vesti,
Paine et travail por nos senti; Sa deité ne senti rien
Issi creez, i ferez bien.
Quand Deix fu mis el monument
Treis iorz i fu tant solement Et au tierz ior le respira
Li pere, qui le suscita Autresi comme li lion Respire son petit foon.
LION
When the lioness gives birth Her cub drops to earth, dead; He lacks the force of life Until the father, on the third day Breathes on him and licks him for love, In this way, he breathes life into him; No other remedy could save him.
(Fig. 4)
So was it with Jesus Christ: The humanity which he assumed, And cloaked himself in for love of us, Suffered pain and labor for us Of which his divinity felt nothing Believe thus and you will do well. When God was put into the tomb He stayed only three days And on the third day again received his breath From the Father who roused him Just as the lion breathes life Into his little cub!!.
Fig. 4 The resurrection of the lion cub, 13th century.

THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
And the custom which prevailed before Christianity, in
Lycia and in Phrygia as in several other regions, of placing
the image of the lion on the tombs of kings or illustrious he
roes, might have its source, in part, in the fabled power of
resurrection which the Ancients attributed to the lion. In the
art of antiquity, his image often accompanies the palm tree
which throughout the ancient world was an emblem of resur
rection still more than of the desert.
The union in Jesus Christ of two natures, human and di
vine, has been the theme of many allegorical images, including
that of the lion, and it is certainly in the lion that the two are
the least visibly differentiated. The Ancients were in agree
ment that all the lion’s active qualities were located in his
foreparts: in his head, neck, chest, and front claws; for them,
the hind quarters served only as the animal’s physical support.
Thus they made the forequarters of the lion the emblem of
Christ’s divine nature, and the hindquarters the image of his
humanity. Was it not perhaps because of this idea that the he
raldic lion, called the “lion rampant,” was represented lifting
himself on his hind legs, with his foreparts turned to the sky?
(Fig, 5).

THE LION
It is also quite natural that mystical writers saw an image of the potent speech of the Christ in the roar of the lion. The formidable voice which resounds through the immense expanses of the desert served as an image for that of the Teacher of the Word and its unequalled range. Hosea prophesied of this matchless voice: “They shall walk after the Lord: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west!?.” And Joel, in turn: “The Lord also shall roar out of Zion!3.”’ Later on, the Latin liturgy would make use of the same terms in speaking of the Savior: De Sion rugiet, et de Jerusalem dabit vocem suam: “The Lord also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem!+.” Perhaps this is why, in our western regions at least, preaching pulpits often are supported by lions. In Chasseignes, near Loudun (Vienne), and in the same city, at the Church of Martray, the pulpits—dating from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries—are made in the form of stone fonts, and rest their base on seated lions. But the lion shares with numerous animals—which are also authentic emblems of Jesus Christ—the negative role of serving equally as an allegorical image for the Antichrist, for Satan. Since the dawn of the Church, the lion has had this evil significance quite often, on account of St. Peter’s words: “Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour!>.” Frequently, in scenes of ancient Christian art where the lion pursues timid does or innocent gazelles, the onlooker sees only the ordinary pursuit of prey by a famished beast, while in
reality, these images illustrate the text from St. Peter.
Commentators on the sacred books explicitly recognized the image of the devil in the lion vanquished by young David!*. The celebrated reliquary of Abbé Bégon, part of the treasure of the ancient ninth-century abbey of Conques-en-Rouergue,
which was known as “St. Vincent’s Lantern,’’ portrayed 1133



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
David’s combat with the lion; and on the damaged inscription
beneath this image, one can still read... sic noster David Sa
tanam superavit: “Thus our David overcame Satan.”
In his infernal role, the lion is often the emblem of one of
the “three concupiscences” to which Christian asceticism at
tributed the downfall of souls: “concupiscence of the flesh”
whence come lust, gluttony, and sloth; “concupiscence of the
eyes” —whence lust again, greed, and envy; “concupiscence of
ptide of life’””—whence pride and wrath. In these three filia
tions of the seven deadly sins, the lion represents pride of life.

THE BULL
N READING THE Old Testament from beginning to end, Ovn is impressed by the innumerable throngs of victims that the patriarchs and their sons, the Hebrews, sacrificed to God. Exodus and Leviticus liturgically codified these sacrifices where sometimes hundreds of victims were slaughtered at the same time. One of the reasons for these impressive holocausts is given in the sacred text: “For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul!.” Whether as an offering under the knife of the sactrificers of Israel, or in the mythic sanctuaries of the Gentiles where often the victim was a human being, the ritual outpouring of blood flowed in ceremonies of all kinds: of glorification, of initiation and propitiation, of atonement and of gratitude. These are also the functions that Catholic theology attributes to the mysterious sacrifice of the body and blood of Jesus Christ on the altar, which took the place of the abolished sacrifices of ancient Mosaic law. It is this substitution that brought about the acceptance, in the signs and symbols of Christianity, of the beasts of the holocaust, the ancient “victims,” as appropriate symbols of the Savior sacrificed for humanity on Golgotha. The blood of numerous animals was shed before the altar of Yahweh: the dove, the kid, the he-goat, the lamb, the cow, the heifer, and the calf; but the principal victim was the ox. In 1155



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
the mythological conceptions of ancient Egypt, the ox or bull
was one of the symbols through which the supreme god
Amon was adored in Thebes; in a hymn of this cult engraved
on a piece of pottery in the British Museum, Amon is sum
moned in the name of the Celestial Bull’.
In ancient times, because of its universal character as a
symbol of fertility, and the sym
bolic similarity between the
shape of its horns and the lunar crescent, the head of the bull was offered and treated separately in Egyptian sacrifices, and its image was worn on amulets. These amulets have been found
in many places in Europe, Asia,
Fig. 1 Apis, flom the tomb of Seti I and Africa}, and attest to the
general character of the ancient connection of the bull and
other horned animals to human fecundity and the cult of the
moon (Fig. 1).
In Egypt, the sacred bull, as well as being the incarnation
of the god Amon was also that of the god Ptah, for it was
the personification of the divine life force renewing itself un
endingly in nature. Perhaps this is why, in the well-known
zodiac of Denderah, the ox is portrayed on its knees with the
“Key of Life,” the ankh, around its neck.
The rather complex mythologies of § Assyria, Chaldea, Media, and Susiana
placed the symbolic bull in relation with celestial influences, and even with the divine nature; and the deified bull
was portrayed with a human face‘.
The impressive man-headed oxen, the
cherubim of Assyria (Fig. 2), adorned
with jeweled tiaras, like the sovereigns
and pontiffs of their countries, and Fig. 2. The cherubim,
provided with great wings like eagles, — fuman-headed bull of Nineveh. 16



THE BULL
ate well-known. The wingless human oxen, however,
represent the infernal monster Eabani (Fig. 3). And
whatever the ancient commentators on the Bible
may have thought, it is completely possible, if not certain, that in Israel, the gold cherubim which cov
Figo ered the Ark of the Covenant with their wings?, and
The Assyrian those in Solomon’s temple®, were oxen more or less
monster, Eabani. similar to those of the Assyrians.
In the Assyro-Babylonian pantheon, the god who was spe
cifically empowered to control thunderstorms was named
Adad; he was “the lord of the celestial fire.” His symbol was
the bull, whose charge is impetuous like that of a storm and
whose voice evokes the rumble of thunder. There is a stele that shows us Adad riding on his symbolic ox with one foot on its hindquarters and the other on its forehead’ (Fig. 4). In his splendid work on the theology of the Greeks, Victor Magnien specifies that oxen were sacrificed to Poseidon, black like his garments, because the noise of the sea, his empire, like the bellowing of the bull, is a result of “powerful breathing®.”
The mysterious cults of Mithra and Orpheus ascribed to
the immolation of the bull such a special power of purification
and propitiation that the bull sacrifices took on the form and
the sacramental liturgy of a kind of baptism of blood. Con
sider this impressive rite:
In an excavation hollowed out under a floor made of lat
ticed wood on which the sacrificers slaughter the bound animal, there stands naked the candidate to receive the benefits
of the initiation and the purification through contact with the ritual blood.
“Through the slats in the wood,” says Prudentius, “the
blood falls into the hollow and the initiate turns his head to

wards the drops that fall; he exposes his entire body to them.
He leans backwards so that they may sprinkle his face, his
ears, his lips, and his nostrils; he immerses his eyes in the
warm liquid and not even sparing his palate, inundates his
tongue in the blood and drinks avidly?.” Then, when the last
agonized tremors have emptied the veins of the powerful vic
tim and his life is extinguished, the initiated one emerges from
the excavation dripping with blood, and offers himself to the
veneration of the people who believe him purified by this scar
let baptism and brought close now to divinity.
Today, near the falls of the Zambezi, a cruel custom still
proclaims the belief in the virtues of hot, living, bovine blood;
The bull or ox has a ligature around its neck; a well-directed
arrow causes abundant bleeding; the black native fills a horn
with the blood and then drinks it with gusto; for other ani
mals, it is from a large cut, with blood gushing from it, that
the natives come to drink as they would from a cup; the beast
is then sewn up again and frolics once more in the midst of the herd!°.”
Today also in Laos, the buffalo is solemnly sacrificed in or
der to ask the heavens to foretell the future to humanity. Re
peatedly but with lapses of time between each stab, so that
death will be slow, the sacrificer plunges a large spear into the
flank of the animal, and the way in which the buffalo falls and
dies indicates to the people whether the year will be good or
bad, peaceful or troubled".
One might believe that the domesticated bull, like the male
buffalo or the wild bison, earned human respect through the
fear it inspired. In the drawings engraved on the walls of pre
historic caves as in the most beautiful Greek works of art, the
bull poses as the powerful chief of the herd. These ancient
testimonials well portray its strength, the speed of its charge,
its fury, its sexual passion, and the imposing gravity of its mo
tionless stance. Nonetheless, it was more as the herd’s prolific
sire than as its formidable leader that the bull was valued by
the people of the first human societies!?. Throughout Asia, it 1188



THE BULL
was always the embodiment of all the psychic and physical energies which constitute the driving force in the lives of all beings. In Egypt the image of the bull was the hieroglyph of the word “fertility” and for the Greeks he was the symbol of the creative force!3. All the cults of the ancient peoples of Iran and Chaldea, who brought us astronomy, celebrated the ram and the bull, the fathers of the herds, as the spring signs of the zodiac. But is it true, as it has been said, that this symbolism came from these regions of Asia and later spread to Egypt and Europe? (Figs. 5 and 6). I prefer to think, on the contrary, that it was born of itself wherever primitive man became hunter and then herdsman. Before Brahmanism appeared in Tibet and India,

before the Sumerians made their rich amulets, even before the civilizations of Babylonia, Nineveh, or Susa were born, the aborigines of the northern slopes of the Pyrenees modeled the clay bison of the cave of the “Two Brothers,” and engraved the superb oxen of the Magdalenian caverns of France and Spain. Relying principally on the visions of Ezekiel and St. John, our first Christian symbolists depicted the ox and the other three animals, eagle, lion, and man, as hieroglyphs of Jesus Christ (Fig. 7). Other French authors of the Middle Ages who fell heir to their way of thinking are equally explicit on this point: “Taurus, Christus,” writes Rabanus Maurus!*; and 1199



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
after him, St. Bruno d’Asti!> and St. Yves of Chartres'® say
the same thing. Thus, they saw the ox as the symbol of the
redeeming victim which through the complete outpouring of
its blood assured the purification of our race and its recon
ciliation with justice from above. But another less well-known
symbolism related the sym
bolic figure of the ox to the
personage of Christ. A close
study of the iconography of
Jesus Christ in the first thirteen centuries shows that,

Tio"
among many others, there were two dominating ideas
that had a considerable influ
ence: one portrays him as the
Fig. 7 The Bull of Ezekiel’: vision source and hearth of light,
(from Raphael painting). and the other as those of life:
he is the illuminating Word, the Word which shed the first
light onto the chaos of the world”, the Word whose doctrine
illuminates souls; he is also the Word which is the creator of
life, and the First Principle whose fertilizing strength spreads
and perpetuates physical life in the natural order on earth!®,
and whose grace produces spiritual life in the supernatural or
der. Thus, from him, the initial source, emerges the sensible
life of the body and the suprasensible life of the soul.
This mystical conception was echoed in the liturgy, in sa
cred literature and art, and also in Christian symbolism, in the
form of the ox, the ram, and the stag.
Here perhaps we should call to mind the Spanish bullfight,
which, however imperfectly, compares the bull to the Re
deemer marching towards death. In tauromachy, the “Veronica
pass” which consists of holding the cape in front of the bull’s
face, is named for the compassionate woman, in the legend
which has sprung up around what was told in the gospel, who
offered her veil to the exhausted Savior’?.
It was in compositions of an apocalyptic nature, above all,

THE BULL
that the bull lent his image to Satan and personified the works of hell: a medieval manuscript, for example, shows us Satan in the form of a being with the head of a lion, the body and horns of a bull, bat wings and eagle’s claws*®; in Veniers, near Loudun, a church cornice from the end of the Roman period shows a variation of the basilisk: an ox with the head of a cock. In a superb fourteenth-century book from Count Ashburnham’s collection?!, the Babylonian god Bel is represented with a head that is half human, half oxlike, a hairy torso, and the legs of a vulture (Fig. 8). This last creation of the Near Eastern imagination coincides, curiously enough, with the sacred iconography of Babylonia in the time of Daniel; the cylindrical seals of other Chaldean documents of this period show us in fact the monster Eabani and other manifestations of evil in the form of horned men with the hindquarters of oxen. Unrelated to this type of iconography, the representations of sea oxen, or dragonlike oxen with snakelike or fishshaped bodies, are also images of evil monsters which are living vehicles of the Evil Spirit (Fig. 9). To the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Canaanites and their neighbors, Molech was an evil god represented as having a human body with a bull’s head. Some of his statues, made of bronze, were colossal and hollow, and his cult ordained that in certain circumstances they should be filled with children, before setting fire to the logs surrounding them and heating the statues to a glowing red.

spite of the prohibition of Leviticus: “Thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech??,” it was by subscribing to this abominable cult that Solomon and Manasseh, kings of Israel?3, committed a sin that brought about the apostasy of the Israelites, until Josiah put an end to these
horrors. Long before our era, Aegean mythology had for its own part imagined the Minotaur, a being strangely resembling the ox-headed monsters of Chaldea. Like them, this creature represented the antithesis of the cherubim, the divine winged oxen with human faces of Assyria, in which we can see images of the “divine power uniting material force with intelligence24.”” According to Homer, Minos, king of Crete, was the son of Jupiter and the nymph Europa, but he did not fulfil his obligations to the divine powers. For this, Poseidon punished him by inspiring in his wife, Pasiphaé, a monstrous passion for the miraculous bull which he had failed to sacrifice to the gods. From this unnatural union there was born the Minotaur, who had the head of an ox and the body of a giant man, like the Eabani of the Chaldeans and Baal of the SyroPhoenicians. The Minotaur became the curse of the island of Crete, and Minos had him locked up in the Labyrinth of Knossos where the Greeks, conquered by the king of Crete, were required periodically to bring him seven boys and seven 2222



THE BULL
girls to devour. Finally, the Greek hero Theseus, with the help
of the enamored Ariadne, killed the Minotaur, thus delivering his country from the hateful tribute. Lanoé-Villéne sees in the story of the Minotaur a very ancient solar myth2>, and Glotz, in accordance with one of the
ptincipal symbolic characteristics of the bull as sire and fertil
izer of the herd, presents the Minotaur as the Cretan god of virile strength. “He demanded victims, like all divinities,” he
wrote, “but it is not the mythology of the Cretans, it is the
legend of foreign peoples who made out of him a god hungry for human blood?¢.” Nevertheless, the Cretan monster has continued to be ac
cepted as one of the representations of the Evil Spirit, and
Theseus, his conqueror, who delivered Greece from his op
pression, was sometimes likened by Christian teachers to Christ, the liberator of souls.

THE EAGLE
N THE TWELFTH century the Archbishop of Tours, Hildebert de Lavardin, wrote the following:
Christus HOMO, Christus VITULUS, Christus LEO, Christus est AVIS, in Christo cuncto notore potes!.
Christus est AVIS... Christ is a bird. He is in fact portrayed, in Christian symbolism, in the forms of a dove, a pelican, a phoenix, a swan, an ibis, a crane, a stork, and in many other less well-known forms. However, here it is the noblest, the king of birds that we are speaking of, the royal eagle, whose characteristics have struck mankind since the beginning of time and won its admiration. In his day, Ezekiel saw it like burning coals of fire; and on the solitary island of Patmos, when the eyes of John the Evangelist opened to the infinite horizons of the eternal kingdom, he in his turn gazed upon what the old prophet had only glimpsed. The Eagle and the three other animals appeared distinctly, no longer as lightning flashes along the rugged banks of the Chebar while their wings sounded “like the noise of great waters,” but beating those quivering wings, on which flamed thousands of eyes, while the whole firmament hailed the triumphant Lamb. These visions of Ezekiel? and St. John* are the principal Christian bases for the symbolism of the eagle, as well as for the lion and the ox; all three were already endowed with the
riches of the past. 2255



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
It is in Central Asia, as well as among the peoples of the near East, that we find the most ancient proven documents on the symbolic value of the eagle. The ancient Hindu religion already used the eagle as the emblem of Vishnu’, and in the art of Chaldea, the eagle is the noble bird that accompanies the king in the royal images, that tames the lion, and that helps the Chaldean Hercules in his battle with the monsters®. The same favored place was given to the eagle in the unusual art of the Hittites of Asia Minor, which is mentioned in the Pentateuch and in the Book of Kings, and whose crude artistic patterns seem to have been drawn from the regions of the Tigris and the Euphrates. It is especially in the religious art of Syria that the eagle appears with the meanings which Christianity later could appropriately transpose to apply to the Lord Jesus Christ. The Syrian eagle and its sacred meanings have been illuminatingly studied by the Belgian professor and savant, Franz Cumont. He says that it is in the region of Hieropolis, the holy city of Figs the great Syrian goddess Atargatis, where the eagle shows itself most frequently on funeral monu

ments, in the role of transporter of souls “toward the celestial gods” (Fig. 1).” Perhaps this vision of the eagle was borrowed by the Syrians—as Cumont believes—from the Babylonians. The fable of Etana, one of their most popular myths, seems, in fact, to bear out this opinion. The eagle having devoured the serpent’s young, the serpent, in revenge, is on the point of killing the marauding bird which it has managed to entrap in its coils; but Etana fights the serpent and frees the eagle, who then betakes itself up to heaven where it seizes—although it is unable to keep—the insignia of divine royalty.

THE EAGLE
This tale, represented in numerous Babylonian works of art, could hardly have been unknown in ancient Syria, since the two countries were in frequent contact. Thus by extension the myth of Etana became the image of the soul and the royal bird became a “psychopomp”’; that is to say, it was seen as the carrier, the vehicle, bearing blessed souls to their celestial source; for, in accordance with Semitic beliefs, souls came to earth from the Sun and had to return to it after the death of the body. The Syrians must have been all the more willing to accept this symbolism since for them the eagle was already the bird of the sun. Like the Egyptians, the ancient peoples of Assyria and Chaldea depicted the sun most often in the form of a disc with two outstretched wings, two great eagle wings; and as the Syrians were descendants of the ancient peoples of Assyria and Chaldea, it seems very likely that this is the source of the idea behind the frequent carvings of the eagle on the burial stones of their dead; the soaring eagle, that is, portrayed the movement of the soul’s departure from earth into space. We also find, in the very ancient art of Sumer, the eagle with a lion’s head which thus unites the sovereignties of both earth and sky. The recent excavations made by Tello have provided us with several examples of this lion-headed eagle. In Phoenicia, the god Melkarth, of Tyre, immolated himself for mankind on a funeral pyre, where, metamorphosed into an eagle, he flew off into the sky, the conqueror of death®. The Greeks, and then later the Romans when they came to Syria, borrowed from the peoples of this region the oriental belief that the sacred eagle carried souls to the kingdom of the gods; and this is no doubt the reason why, in Greece and in Rome, the eagle became the bird of Zeus and Jupiter. It also explains its presence on Plato’s tomb?, and why a live bird was placed on the summit of the funeral pyre that was erected in Tarsus in honor of Sandan-Heracles, the protector of the city who is portrayed on its coins. From there also stems the special liturgy of the Apotheosis, in the Rome of 2277

in the shape of a pyramid, which was to consume the body or

the soul of the newly deified being in its flight towards
heaven!® (Fig. 2). This rite was not restricted to royalty, and was also used for numerous other individuals. The priceless treasure recently discovered in Montalban

tians, following the conversion of Constantine and the liberating edict of 314, the emblem of the triumph of the Christian religion over persecution and of its universal diffusion. This is probably the significance of the representation of the eagle on Christian lamps in the fourth century in Carthage!? (Fig. 3) and elsewhere, and also on the beautiful fragment of a sarcophagus at Arles where the eagle appears, its wings in gliding flight, and on its breast a crown in the center of which one can still see half of a “Chrismon” with the I and the X superimposed! The eagle, bird of the sun and conductor of souls to heaven, was to the ancient peoples also the carrier of celestial fire and light. The Greeks, and subsequently the Romans, represented it holding in its claws the lightning bolts of Zeus-Jupiter; the Egyptians and the Assyrians gave its wings to the solar disc. It was believed that the eagle and the falcon were the only creatures that could stare fixedly into the sun’s intense light, and that the eagle tested the legitimacy of its young by making

The eagle plays with lightning bolts, said the ancient poets, when the most terrible outbreaks of thunder and lightning make all other living beings tremble; and it is no doubt for this reason that the ancient Greeks nailed eagles above their doors, in order to protect themselves from evil forces and from being struck by lightning!*, which, they believed, never touched this bird!7. The symbolism of Christ as fire and light penetrated the
most ancient Christian liturgy.

wards the sun, into the abode of the gods, said that the bird
came so close to the divine star that in its old age its feathers
became charred, and its flesh dried up almost completely; but
once it returned to the earth, it plunged itself three times in
the spring water of a fountain and emerged regenerated, with
all the youthfulness of its early years. This fable was already
very old when the Church was born, since David was inspired
by it: “Bless the Lord,” he wrote, “who satisfieth thy mouth
with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the
eagle’s!8,”
Because of the regeneration that the eagle found in the life
giving fountain, the ancient Orientals made it the emblem not
of the resurrection of the body, but of the immortality of the
soul, and this was one of the roles in which it was adopted by
the Syrians, as the protective spirit of their tombs!?.
The Egyptian eagle sometimes appears carrying in its beak
the “Cross of Life,” and in the West also the eagle and the
idea of life were related. Thus it is that a stone called “the
eagle’s stone,” an iron-oxide geode which encloses a semi
liquid center, was a much sought after talisman. In his Hortus
Sanitatis, Joannes de Cuba, an author of the latter part of the
fifteenth century, wrote that the eagle takes this stone into its
nest because it counteracts the great heat that the bird gener
ates to the point of endangering its own eggs; the stone can
conquer the heat even of fire?°. Other ancient authors at
tributed a solar origin to these stones. Those who believed
that they possessed them used to place them in contact with women in labor to aid their delivery.
We have seen in the previous study of the lion that it was
an emblem of royalty and the Resurrection of Christ, but also
an emblem of Satan the Antichrist, because, according to St.
Peter, it is the beast of prey who roars and seeks to devour.
The eagle also, image of Christ in many ways, was taken to
represent Satan, because it is not only the noble and magnifi
cent bird but also the rapacious destroyer; under this aspect
Deuteronomy had already categorized it among the impure 30



THE EAGLE
beasts, whose flesh the Israelites were not to eat?!. We know that one of the first emblems chosen to represent Christ was the fish which, by analogy, was taken as the image of the faithful as well. It was in this role that it was associated with the eagle, giving the latter its satanic meaning: the eagle was shown trampling with its talons a fish which it often struck with its beak. It is a fact, it seems, that the eagle dives at times from the heights of the sky on fish that sleep trustingly, near the surface of the water, and carries them off to eat its fill. In the fifteenth century Joannes de Cuba describes the eagle thus: “He has so sharp a vision that from the air, where he is so high he can barely be seen, he spies the little fish swimming in the sea and lets himself fall in like a stone, and takes the fish and carries it to the shore to eat it... 2? (Fig. 5)” So the devil does with the soul.

Elsewhere in the Christian works of art, the eagle captures a hare, or catches in its claws a young lamb. A few of the Church fathers have tried to explain away the carnivorous actions of the eagle: when it falls from the clouds
like lightning on the fish of the tranquil waters, say the Saints 3311

TT SOUL OF Christ was joined on earth with a human
body which suffered and died on Calvary, and in whose
likeness artists from every Christian era have shown him, in
picturing the events of his terrestrial life. But
symbolically he is represented only in the con
ventional form attributed to the angel, of a winged man (Fig. 1). The beneficent spirits had already been given this form in Chaldean art and in the art
of ancient Greece long before our era. Primitive Christian art adopted it as a convention
to represent the angels who, in the Bible,
sometimes manifest themselves as handsome
young men!—and also, sometimes, represent
the Christ taken as Aggelos, as “Angel’’: that is to say, as “the one sent,” a messenger from the Father, and the bringer of salvation. We shall see this human body and its wings
in the Tetramorph which, like Ezekiel’s ani
mals, unites the four faces in one image. The

known till then that Christ brought to the world, and refers to
his angelic character as the Father’s messenger.
Commentators on the sacred books began very early to
designate the angels as manifestations of the divine Word, 3333

which Christ was to represent in the course of the coming
ages. In the Bible, it is the angels who transmit the word of
God to humans—for example, those who appeared to Abra
ham?2, to Jacob3, and to Moses in the burning bush*; it was
the angel of the Lord also who comforted the young Hebrews
in the fiery furnace o
Babylon?. The commentators
likened the angel of the Lord
to the horseman whom
Zechariah saw standing

the angel in the Book of
Judges who is called “won

Raphael, and Uriel: it is the
Angel-Word of the beginning
of things, who was “with God, and... was God,” ac

Sometimes artists became the interpreters® of these theo
logical opinions and gave Christ the conventional appearance
of the angel adopted by their era. At other times they sub
stituted Jesus directly for the biblical angel: this was the case
with Nicolas Froment, who in his beautiful fifteenth-century
painting of the burning bush, in the Cathedral of Aix-en
Provence, placed the Savior in the midst of the flames. Some
times he even wears wings like the angels, as we see him on
the central medallion of an altar cross of medieval workman
ship (Fig. 2).

occasionally Jesus Christ as the supreme Angel; let us say

lics as well as the Gnostics showed angels with human bodies
dressed in girdled robes and equipped with a pair of bird’s
wings. The middle of the first millenary was sometimes more
idealistic, and in the sixth century, angels appear on a minia
ture of Kosmas Indicopleustes, formed by a human face carried by several pairs of elegantly arranged wings (Fig. 3). During the Romanesque era, western medieval art depicted them in many ways, all of them hieratic and often with multiple wings. In the latter part of the Middle Ages the angel was further humanized, and the marvelous spirits painted by Fra Angelico are radiant apparitions of the most delightfully idealized human type. At the same time, the custom of portraying St. Michael in the form of a knight in armor caused the repre
sentation, at times, of anonymous an
gels also in war dress, considering angels as the militia of God’s celestial armies. At Ewelme in Oxfordshire, the artist who decorated the tomb of the
Duchess of Suffolk at the end of the fifteenth century surrounded it with alternating angel-priests and angel-knights, the latter armed from head to toe and carrying great shields; all with folded

The last three centuries of the Middle Ages saw the adoption of a more immaterial form which reduced the angel to the human face alone, framed by two wings, a very ethereal figure which through the suppression of the body and limbs likens the angel to the “Bird of Paradise” of the symbolists of that

The art of those times reveals that among certain oriental peoples, as among the Egyptians, the posture of adoration is one of kneeling and lifting the open hands to the level of the head!3, This is the position of the hands of suppliants shown in the little votive statuettes of Asia Minor, as well as the figures standing in front of the solar disk on the great carved boulder of Eflatoun in Lycaonia!*+ (Fig. 6). The hand as a symbol of the divine was also the instrument of sacred gestures in the celebrations of the old Babylonian cults, and “among the hymns which often express sublime feelings in magnificent poetry, one of the most beautiful is the hymn to Ishtar which is entitled ‘Prayer of the elevation of the hand!5.’” In ancient Caucasia and the region of the Caspian Sea, as it was elsewhere, the hand was the dual symbol of divine bounty and power and of human supplication; and in ancient Greece, in the cults of all such deities as Aesculapius and Hygeia who dispensed the gift of health, divine aid was symbolized by the succoring hand. The hand appears in Carthage on the steles characterized by the mysterious triangle of

Thus, Christian symbolism found that the sign of the hand
was honored everywhere by different nations for reasons that
the doctrine could easily adopt; so the hand rapidly became
one of the symbols used specifically for God the Father and
for Christ. As a general rule, when it represents the Son and
not the Father, the hand is placed on a cross, between alpha

whereas the right was the image of his mercy, his goodness, and his generosity. Certain ancient representations show him
with the right hand, the “Hand of Mercy,” larger than the

the sky, and which can only be the hand of Christ whose divinity he had just recognized!®. The laying on of hands is one of the oldest gestures that we know. In Genesis, we see Isaac laying his hands on his sons Esau and Jacob, and Egyptian monuments show us figures in analogous postures. This imposition of the hand or of both hands was also part of a great number of initiations into the mysteries of pre-Christian cults in Asia, Europe, and Aftica. In the gospels Jesus is constantly placing his hands on someone to bless and heal (Fig. Fig. 12 The caressing 12). Following the example of their master af

known since the early days of human civilizations, which is
that a considerable quantity of magnetic fluid escapes through
the fingers of the outstretched hand. The Ancients even then
had the firm faith that after having raised their hands to
heaven to call and receive the divine influx, it was then con
centrated and in turn communicated to others by placing their
outstretched fingers on their heads. This divine influx was
shown by Christian iconography as light rays coming from the
hand (Fig. 13).
The hand of Christ is sometimes shown as blessing and at
others as the symbol of his omnipotence and of the univer
sality of his empire. It holds then in its palm the seven apoc
alyptic stars?!, as images of the immensities of the firmament
(Fig. 14), or the globe of the world surmounted by the cross.
In this role, the Lord’s hand is rarely separated from the
whole image of his person. The iconographic image pictured
in Figure 14 shows the seven stars together as fire flowers
within the circumference of the circle of the firmament. It is
borrowed from an illumination in a twelfth-century manu
script??.

not imply the idea of benediction but rather that of action and power. In iconography, the hand which represents this Digitus Dei est hic of the sacred writings must be a right hand with only the index finger extended, the other fingers being folded (as in the pointing hand), because the extension of the index finger alone is the natural gesture of imperative command allowed only to the one in authority. Among all the ancient peoples whose
3)
civilizations are known to us, especially those of Asia, Europe, and North Af rica, and up to modern times, the image of the heart is used much more as the ideogram for knowing, for reason- J \ ing, and for understanding, than for affective or physical love??. The sages of ia ear ale
phys SI weighed in the scales of judgment.
Egypt affirmed that the heart is the source of all that man knows, and all that he can do; and from it, they said, human activity receives its inspirations and its force in the realm of thought as 4 well as in that of physical action. Fig. 16 The vase, hieroglyph The whole point of view of ancient fiaheatt times, both in the Orient and Occident, was summed up by Pliny in the words: “Inside itself, the heart in its winding passages provides the first home of the soul and the blood... there the Intelligence resides*4.”” Starting with such concepts, the religious thought of the ancient Egyptians quite naturally also made the heart of the supreme God the seat and source of divine perfections. And consequently we see old texts expressly evoking the divine Heart. Ramses II, after being ill-supported by his officers in a battle, ended his reproaches to them by saying: “I will no longer carry you in my heart”’?> (Figs. 15 and 16). In one of the hymns composed by the Pharaoh Amenhotep

age of the Divinity symbolized by the solar disc, we read in
the course of a long text: “Thou hast created the earth in
thine heart, when thou wast alone... thou hast made the sea
sons to give birth and growth to all thou hast created... thou
hast made the distant sky that thou mightest rise up into it
and see from there all that thou hast created, thou alone.
Thou appearest in the form of the living Aten; thou risest
shining, thou goest away and returnest, thou art in my
heart... 2°”
The same concept is expressed in the funerary inscription
of a priest of Memphis, the text and meaning of which have
been established by Maspéro, Breasted, and Erman. From this
it appears that the theologians of the Memphis school made a
distinction, in the work of the Author of all things, between
the role of creative thought, which they called the action of the
heart, and that of creation’s instrument, which they called the
action of the tongue, the Word?’. Another theological school
that we learn about from the monuments of the time of the
Ramses pharaohs (nineteenth dynasty, about 1200 B.C.) ex
presses a theory according to which God, the supreme God
whose nature (literally, name) is mystery, is presented as being
formed of three distinct entities which make up a true Tri
unity: Ptah, Horus, and Thoth. Ptah is the Supreme Person,
the perfect intelligence; Horus, according to a belief which
was already ancient at that time, is the comprehensive and af
fective Heart of the divinity, the spirit that animates all of
life; Thoth is the Word, the instrument of the divine works.
Ptah is delineated as the Supreme Being, because in a way
the whole triad comes from him. According to the evidence
mentioned above, he is “He who becomes Heart, he who be
comes Tongue.”
Hortus, the divine Heart, was represented in sacred art in
the form of a falcon. From the time of the fourth dynasty,
about 2575 to 2465 B.c., he appeared under this symbol; for
instance, on the beautiful statue of Chephren in the Cairo
museum, the sacred bird leans his heart, his whole body, 4422



THE MAN
against the nape of the pharaoh whom he protects and inspires, and whose head he enfolds with his spread wings (Fig. 17). The singular attitude of the falcon god means very much more than just an attendance on the pharaoh, the back of whose neck he covers and warms at the very sensitive spot which neurology calls the “Bridge of Varolius,” which puts him into almost immediate contact with the cervical nerve ganglion that certain anatomists have named the “Tree of Life.” Could it not be said that by means of this warm touch the divine Bird, symbol of the heart of the deity, in some way fecundates Chephren’s spirit in the brain, in that hostelry where, according to the sages of that epoch, the thoughts conceived and born in the heart stay a while before they can be sent out into the world by the movement of the tongue and the opening of the lips, in the utterance of words? The sublime hymn in honor of the eternal Word with which St. John begins his Gospel has been inscribed in the Christian liturgy since its inception and forever after: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.... All things were made by him... In him was life; and the life was the light of men.... That was the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.... And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us... And of his fullness have all we received... .?8” At the close of each celebration of the Mass, the church acclaims and recalls the gifts of the Word, and its dues. In symbolic terms, it is the human tongue that represents this eternal Word, the Christ; but in fact, in literature as well

form the chief gate of the breath, which is aspiration and ex
piration; they call forth or put a stop to this factor that is
necessary to life. Only through them can pass exhalations
charged with the particular influences that have such specific
roles in various liturgies, as well as in magic. The Catholic
Church sanctifies breathing from the first moments of the
baptismal liturgy?®, and introduces it into her exorcisms; and
in the rites of Holy Saturday, the celebrant begins by breath
ing three times on the water that he blesses in the name of
God, to whom he says: Tu has simplices aquas tuo ore benedicito:
©Thou thyself, O God, with thy mouth bless these pure wa
ters.” Then he calls upon Virtue, the power from on high,
and again breathes three times on the water, adding: “May
the Virtue of the Holy Ghost make this water fruitful and
give it the power to regenerate*®.”
Here, the lips of the priest, by means of words and breath,
can take the place of the divine mouth and breathing whose
image and interpreters they are. This same role devolves upon
them when they pronounce the sacramental words of the con
secration of the bread and wine in the canon of the Mass:
“This is my Body; this is my Blood.”
In the human mouth, the lips guard the door, for they stop
the breath or let it pass as they do speech. Acting with the
tongue and the vocal cords, it is they who give the word its
form, its clarity, its beauty, its power to act. It is they who
seal the vows of love or faith with the kiss of loyalty, giving
them their supreme consecration, and when they betray, an
echo is heard of Gethsemane: “Forthwith he [Judas] came to
Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him?!.”
There are many passages in the scriptures that praise pure
lips. David prayed that his might be opened by the Lord him
self, so that he might praise him fittingly3?; and he attributes
the privilege of perfect praise to the lips of innocent children:
Twas infentivmn of Lactontium verfecisti laudem: “Out of the
44



THE MAN
mouth of infants and of sucklings thou hast perfected praise??.” Our illuminators of the first fifteen centuries of the Christian era, especially in Byzantium and the Orient?+, reproduced a number of times the scene where Yahweh’s seraphim place a burning coal from the altar on the lips of the prophet Isaiah, saying to him: “Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away? (Fig. 18).”
It is the divine Word, expressing
itself through human lips, that our forefathers honored by giving the name Chrysostom, “golden mouth,” to John, holy bishop of Constantinople, who lived in the fourth century, and that of Chrysologus, “golden word,” to St. Peter, archbishop of Ravenna, a century later. To symbolize Jesus Christ under the aspect of the divine Word, the
artists of antiquity sometimes made
use of animal and other forms that had been chosen by the writers of Scripture: the lion roaring in the desert, the bellowing bull in the pasture, the eagle crying in the cloud, the swan singing its final song, the cock saluting the dawning day, the nightingale’s nocturnal melodies —and also, the thunder that follows lightning, and the trumpet, the conch, and the bell, which call and command. The anatomical shape of the tongue does not lend itself at all to such images, so in most cases, when artists have tried to show the Savior as the Word, they have done so, following the text of the Apocalypse, with a sword blade between the lips: “And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword; that with it he should smite the nations?®.” The word strikes and penetrates like a sword. Few artists have risked using the im

age of the tongue itself, and the results of their daring have
not been happy. About the end of the fifteenth century the
symbolists of L’Estoile Internelle showed it as a sort of oval
form inscribed with a V, probably alluding to
the “lingual V” formed by the thick, chalice
shaped papillae on the human tongue, and to
the initial letter of the accompanying inscrip
tion, taken from St. John: Verbum caro factum
est: “The Word was made flesh?” (Fig. 19).”
This image is very similar to the wax tongues
which mothers offer at the tomb of St.
Radegund in Poitiers so that their children may
speak readily and clearly.

of the sea. Then it evokes the creating and fecundating Spirit which, the Bible says, moved over the first waters among the shadows covering the abyss, “in the beginning,’ when “God created the heaven and the earth*°.” The description of the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles in the feast of Pentecost was naturally symbolized by tongues of flame. The sacred text tells how, when the Apostles were assembled, “there appeared unto them cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance*!.” Artists of the Middle Ages represented the fiery tongues, in which dwelt the Holy Spirit, by straight rays coming from the hand of the All-Powerful or from the beak of the divine bird*?, Sometimes the flames undulate like blazing swords that spring from a cloud or from the beak of the holy dove*? (Fig. 22). With the dawning of the Renaissance, artists gave these tongues the form of fiery drops or tears placed on the Apostles’ brows, something like the flames that the illuminators and the even earlier painters—the Byzantines, for instance++— put on the brows of certain angels, or on those of some of the ideal personifications of great virtues, such as Giotto’s Charity*>. At about this same time another symbol was added, that of the inner fruit, the edible nut, of the almond tree, whose 4AT7

shape is like that of the human tongue. Like the tongues of
fire, this symbol referred to the gift of tongues that the Apos
tles received at Pentecost. These tongues of fire which de
scended upon the Apostles only after Christ’s death seem not
to refer to him; however, it must be remembered that he had
said “But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the
Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all
things... 46”
Truly the best and worst of all things, as Aesop says, is the
human tongue. The spirit of the old Phrygian fabulist still
lends itself to the game of contraries so dear to former sym
bolists. We have just seen how the word of salvation came to

us by the tongue and lips of Christ; nevertheless, speaking in the name of the teacher of the whole world, his disciple St. James affirms that “the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity*”.” Under this aspect it symbolizes the Evil Spirit; and Christian symbolists then show it as forked like that of a serpent or headed with an arrow or harpoon, a shape they attribute to the tongues of dragons. It is supposed to wound like a dart or to carry a mortal poison, for evil speech always causes pain or
corruption. From the eleventh to the sixteenth centuries, medieval sculpture often placed in the symbolic decoration of churches the faces of men, women, or devils, exhibiting monstrous tongues. A Satan on the towers of Notre Dame de Paris sticks out a long, pointed tongue over the city; one of the devils on the Cathedral at Bourges has one that is wide and pendulous. At Santa Maria Formosa de Venise, at Rheims, strange figures loll out their tongues to one side. Very different feelings are expressed by these hideous faces. We read in them despondency or breathless anguish, as the case may be, and often mockery and scorn, as at Magdalen College at Oxford. Elsewhere the protruding tongue may be the symbol of greed or even of the most repugnant lust*®. Yet, in its other aspect, the tongue represents the Logos, the creative Word, which has remained above the world since its beginning like a gliding bird, if one may so describe it, to ensure the continuation of life, its perpetual fecundation, and to inspire the wise. It is in fact by means of it that chosen souls lift themselves as far as it is possible to go toward the unknowable mysteries, which they know to be the necessary cloak in which divinity must hide itself from our eyes while
we live on earth.

THE HORN
HE ANCIENT SYMBOLISM of a number of the horned animals—the bull, the ram, the wild sheep, the buck goat, the deer, the oryx, the unicorn—presents a common character in addition to aspects peculiar to each one; the horn expresses active force, strength, domination, the power of command. This is indeed one of the earliest known manifestations of symbolism: in the oldest human societies that we know of in the epochs known as Aurignacian, Chellian, Magdalenian, and Solutrian, the staff of authority, at once magic wand and scepter, was made of
reindeer horn, and Déchelette mentions
that during the period when the last great dolmens were built “symbolic bulls’ horns had an importance in European fetishism equal to that of the axe!” with which it is sometimes associated? (Fig. 1). A recently-discovered piece of Elamite pottery worked more than three thousand years before our era carries the stylized image of an ibex?; the animal’s horns are so huge that their exaggeration can only mean to express their symbolic importance (Fig. 2). Much later, the Gauls of

THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
western France put the horns of roebuck and beef animals in
the tombs of their dead, along with the ritual lamp, and their
warriors’ helmets were adorned with animal horns* (Fig. 3).
Even earlier, in the same symbolic spirit, the potentates of
ancient Asia wore horned crowns, as shown on the stele of
Naram Sin, king of Assyria. On another monument, this
horned crown is called “the crown of domination, characteris
tic of the divinity>.” This idea was
found everywhere in the ancient
world, as well as amulets or talis
mans shaped like bovine heads,
which have already been spoken of®.
Hermetic signs? or schematic fig
ures of horned heads (Fig. 4) are
also found, frequently carved on
Fig. 3. Gallic helmets with horns. rocks® or on the most ancient mon
uments. Often these drawings suggest a symbolism close to
that of the chalice, whose function is to receive, contain, and
preserve; by their bowl-shapes, like cross-sections of cups,
they seem to indicate the reception of higher influences, divine
or magnetic forces coming from above.
The horned skulls of bovines, of the male goat, and the
deer, were associated with the lunar cult, and the Greek poet
Nonnus (to quote only one writer) drew attention
to the more or less pre
cise similarity in shape
between the horns or
antlers of these animals cee
and the crescent moon’.
It is claimed by some with
apparent reason that while for the Ancients of the West the
bull’s horns had a connection with the moon, those of the ram
were linked with the sun, because they curled like the solar
spirals of the ancient symbolism.
Tn anv case. in all the old civilizations, the horn was the

THE HORN
symbol of the active, dominant force; and for the Hebrews,
among others, the horn expressed the power both of good and
evil. In the Tabernacle of Yahweh, God of Israel, the altar of
the burnt offerings was built of acacia wood, and Moses
placed at its four corners horns covered with
brass!°; and in the special liturgy of certain
sacrificial rites, the priest marked these horns
with his finger dipped in the warm blood of
the sacrificed victim!!. Between these brazen
horns, prayer mounted with the smoke of the
burnt offering toward the All-Powerful whose
blessings then descended on the people or on the suppliant. An ancient Mycenaean altar, re
produced by Déchelette, shows the arrange
ment of the horns on the altars during the wer two thousand years preceding the Christian
y P 8 Fig. 5 Ancient horned
eral? (Fig. 5). lear fron’ Vicenae:
It was with a horn filled with consecrated
oil, kept in the Tabernacle, that the kings of Israel were an
nointed!3, And in the First Book of Kings, in St. Jerome’s
translation of the Bible, the Vulgate, we read these words:
Dominus judicabit fines terrae, et dabit imperium regi suo, et sub
limabit cornu Christi sui: “The Lord shall judge the ends of the
earth, and he shall give empire to his king, and shall exalt the
horn of his Christ!+.” In the description of his prophetic vi
sions, Daniel speaks first of a monster armed with ten horns,
of which one, the largest, makes war upon the saints of God.
Then in another vision a young he-goat fights with a ram;
their horns break and immediately grow back again; all these
horns are the powers which animate the Spirit of Evil.
Christian symbolism, like that of the Hebrew Bible, also ac
cepted the horn as the symbol of the active power of both
good and evil. The lid of a tomb in the Abbey of St. Gall
shows two armed and horned personages, representing two
opposing moral forces: Vice and Virtue in bitter combat'®
(Fig. 6). And often, as in the case of St. Nizier of Troyes, 5577

medieval Christian art shows the deadly sins as horned
personages!’.
Except for rare exceptions, abundance goes hand in hand
with power. So this idea of power which the Ancients con
nected with the animals’ horns resulted in the later connection
with the symbol of Fortune, the horn of plenty. The origin of
this latter, according to Ovid!8, was linked by the Greeks with
the goat Amaltheia, whose milk, they said, was given by the
two nymphs Adrasteia and Io to nourish the infant Zeus. The
supreme god in gratitude placed Amaltheia among the stars,
and gave the two nymphs one of her horns which he endowed
with the power of filling itself in abundance with all the earth’s
good gifts.
The Hellenized Egyptians of Alexandria, in the last cen
turies before our era, borrowed the symbol of the horn of
plenty from the Greeks, relating it to the generosity of their
divinities; it was in this role that it was attributed to Isis, god
dess of all good things. An Alexandrine statuette of baked
clay, now in the museum of Lille, shows the “god of the
Word” pointing with his finger at his lips, the organs of
speech, and holding in his left hand the cornucopia filled with
grapes. Another little statue shows the god Amon, the Zeus
of Egypt, clothed in a ram’s hide and holding the horn of
plenty in his hand?°. 5588



THE HORN
In the Far East, the equivalent of the cornucopia has always been and still remains the gourd?!. Dom Leclercq states that the horn of plenty, which appeared quite often in the art of the early Church, never had any symbolic value there and played a purely decorative role?*. This is true in most cases; however, when the horn is surmounted with a crown of flowers carrying the monogram of Christ, with a dove supporting it on either side?? or when it is placed on the cross** (Fig. 7), it certainly seems allowable to see in it a symbol of the blessings from on high coming to the soul through the Eucharist. At the end of the fifteenth century, the symbolist of L’Estoile Internelle accompanied an image of the cornucopia with words from the Magnificat: “He hath filled the hungry with good things?°.”” The horn of plenty, then, the horn of the goat Amaltheia in the charming old fable, becomes an emblem of the munificence of Christ. And it is interesting that the cornucopia of the Estoile Internelle contains, among the fruits of the earth, three crosses (Fig. 8) which can only mean that the sufferings of this life are often in themselves providential gifts whose mysterious value is not recognized at once but which generate fu

ture happiness. This is precisely the view that Catholic spirituality has always held. It must be added that since every coin has its other side, the horn of plenty is also a symbolic image of heresy “when it pours forth evil things in the form of scorpions, reptiles, and dragons?6,”” 5599

THE BOVINES
MONG THE BEEF animals, first of all we have the barnyard ox, the bullock or steer, which is no other than the bull adapted by the countryman to the role of servant for what an old monastic rule calls “the holy work of the hands.” Among sacrificial animals, it was the pure victim, which must perforce lead a life of chastity, even as Christ by his very nature did in his life on earth. Briefly, we can say that the ox was at times taken as the image of the saints; for example, the twelve brass oxen who upheld the immense vat, the “molten sea,” which Solomon placed in the temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem!, were seen by commentators on the sacred books as excellent representations of the twelve apostles who supported the Church in its infancy?. The ox was also taken as the image of all those who worked “in the field of God,” especially of the teaching pontiffs and the preachers, because of its continence and the strength of its voice (Fig. 1). This symbolism was common enough among literary circles in the Middle Ages to explain how the words of the illustrious Dominican Albertus Magnus, speaking of his silent, hardworking disciple Thomas Aquinas, could be understood by everyone: “Let this ox be; his bellowing shall echo through all the world>.” The first Christian commentators and symbolists recognized various symbols of the Redeemer in each different form of bovine offered as sacrifice in the ancient religion of Israel. The
calf, image of Christ— “Vitulus Christus,” as the Archbishop 6611



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
of Mainz, Rabanus Maurus, wrote in the ninth century+
represents the Savior as a victim free from sin, because its
youth makes it a virgin animal, and also because the condi
tions of its sacrifice, specified in the Book of Numbers’, re
quire that it be without spot or blemish. The repre
sentation of the mystic and
Christlike calf is not frequent in
Christian art, but we nonetheless
find some beautiful examples
(see Title Figure, p. 61).
It is generally believed that
Christianity from the very beginning
forbade its followers to sacrifice ani
mals during a liturgical ceremony.
Although this is true in a general
Fig. 1 Calf on the facade of the
sense, the ritual sacrifices of animals church of the Celle-Briére.
persisted for a long time in several
countries of the Christian Near East®. In Armenia, especially,
at least until the time of the Crusades, the bishops and priests
gave their blessing to the slaughter of animals which then
provided banquets where the clergy and the faithful met and
ate together. The immolation of the victim was called matal,
“sacrifice,” or patarag, a word whose usage was otherwise re
stricted to the sacrament of the Eucharist. Besides the lamb,
which was a requirement on Easter Day, the ox, calf, cow,
sheep, and even pig were sacrificed, as well as those wild ani
mals and birds which Mosaic law classified as pure. These
sacrifices were quite frequent: they took place every Sunday
and on the principal saints’ days, on days on which a church,
an altar, or a Christian monument was consecrated, and the
third, ninth, and fortieth day following the death of a believer.
For the Sunday matal the victim was brought to the door of
the church, to the foot of a cross, where it was covered with
a scarlet cloth; the priest then blessed some salt and recited
four chosen psalms and some passages from Leviticus, from
the Gerand Rank af Kins. from the Epistle of St. Paul to the 62



THE BOVINES
Hebrews, and from the Gospel of St. Luke; then followed several long prayers evoking the sacrifices of ancient law and
that of Jesus Christ on Calvary. Finally the victim was fed the salt, and then its throat was cut’. The meat was then cooked
and eaten by everyone together. This meal, like the first meals
which Christians ate in common, was named agape, that is,
feast of love. The blood of the victim was not collected and
the remains of its flesh could not be saved in people’s houses
with other unblessed, ordinary foods. The matal and the ritual
banquet of friendship had to follow immediately the eucharis
tic sacrifice of consecrated bread and wine. By its very liturgy
and by its denomination of patarag, the whole matal and ban
quet could be considered a sacramental ritual. The victim of
the Sunday matal had to have been born during that same
year® and be sufficiently large to provide the meal, which al
lows one to think that it was most often either a bull or a heifer calf.
In telling us of the apostasy of the Hebrews at the foot of
Mount Sinai, as they turned away from Yahweh to prostrate
themselves before the sacred calf of the country of Canaan,
the book of Exodus made this animal one of the symbols of
the spirit of evil®. The calf of cast gold, this “golden god,”
Fig. 2. The golden calf: 18th century. 6633



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
became in fact the image of the “demon of riches” in Chris
tian symbolism. And at times the golden calf does not repre
sent cupidity but simply idolatry, in remembrance of the
apostasy of Israel! (Fig. 2).
The symbol of the heifer as the flawless virgin victim, sacri
ficed for the remission of sins outside the camp of Israel, is
the same as that of the calf; but the ted heifer or the cow of
the same color which is mentioned in the Book of Numbers
had a very specific meaning in Christian symbolism. The Lord
said unto Moses: “Speak unto the children of Israel, that they
bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish,
and upon which never came yoke: And ye shall give her unto
Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her forth without the
camp, and one shall slay her before his face: And Eleazar the
priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of
her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation
seven times!!,” Then the biblical text goes on to say that the
ashes of the red heifer, which was to be consumed by the fire
after its slaughter, are to be mixed with “a water of separa
tion,” water that “is a purification for sin!?.”
In all these liturgical applications, which were commented
on at length by the Alexandrian Philo Judaeus in the first few
years of our era, the mystics of the Middle Ages saw pro
phetic allegories in the Passion of Jesus Christ, during which
his body was drenched with blood. They made of the red
heifer “the image of the Redeemer’s bleeding flesh. The heifer
is the flesh of Christ,” proclaimed Rabanus Maurus, in the
ninth century, and he explains this by the animal’s color!?.
In India the red cow symbolizes the dawn, and the black
cow, the dusk, the seeming birth and death of the sun!*. An
orientalist once told me that it also symbolizes the two ex
treme ends of human life: the beginning of life by its milk
which represents all maternal milk, as it is the best of all wet
nurses——and the end of life because when man pronounces
the onomatopoetic sound that imitates the lowing of a cow:

the image of death which comes with the last breath. This
very oriental concept is related to that of the sacred AUM of
the Hindus, and we know how important everything is that
relates to breath in the metaphysics of several of the great
Asiatic nations!?.
In ancient Egypt the cow was one of the psychagogic ani
mals; Ra-Sun rose into the sky on the back of a cow, and it
was often red cows that dragged the mummies to the tombs
before being sacrificed; the divine cow, like the divine bull,

carried souls to the other world!®. In another connection, the divine cow Hathor, goddess of the Theban mountains, whose name is similar to Horus, the heart of divinity, was also the goddess of dawn and dusk, of the appearance and extinction of light, as in Asia!” (Fig. 3). Was it as the ancient goddess of sunset in Asia, Egypt, Cyprus, and Phoenicia that the medieval iconography of the West, influenced by old traditions, attached the cow to the triumphal chariot of the personified Moon!8? (Fig. 4). Practices as old and of
the same origin, concerning the cow as well as the bull, are still in use even now in the religious lives of certain Mediterranean countries!°. On the other hand, the horns of the cow as well as those of the bull recall the shape of the lunar crescent. The thoughtless frolicking of the young calves and heifers
in the pastures was regarded by the ancient masters of spir
itual life as a symbol of dizzy recklessness, “the impulsiveness 6655



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
that throws youth in the path of violent passions”®.” From an
other angle, the cow was at times taken as the symbol of lack
of intelligence, of stupidity; and when seen walking after a
bull who refuses the yoke, it is the symbol of the soul that
follows blindly the instigators of schisms and heresies, which
rebel against the yoke of the Church. It has also been one of
the signs for abject passions”!.

THE SHEEP
HE IMAGE OF the ram, inherited from primitive peoples,
was one of the favorite religious symbols of ancient civili
zations. In Egypt, from the time of the most ancient Phar
aonic dynasties, the god Amon-Ra, the all-powerful Sun, was
worshipped in the form of a ram, crowned with the solar disk
(Fig. 1). The ram was the symbolic animal of Kneph, one of

the oldest representations of the creator-god', who was gener
ally pictured with a ram’s head (Fig. 2). The image of Osiris
had four heads and four horns, one head and one horn for
each of the cardinal points?. Later the ram became, like the
bird, the sign of the idea of human survival, and hence of the soul?, 6677



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
The Greeks borrowed the symbolism of the ram from the
Egyptians; their highest expression of the divinity, Zeus, was
likened to the god Amon of Egypt and is portrayed with a
human torso with ram’s horns; on the coins of Lysimachos,
Alexander the Great was thus represented as Zeus Amon’.
For the ancient Mazdeans of Persia in the old cults of
Turan and in the most ancient Brahmanism, the ram was the
symbol and the vehicle of Agni, one of the two great princi
ples: the pure spirit, the fiery principle as opposed to Soma,
Fig. 3. Chinese paper talisman for a happy and fruitful marriage.
the watery principle. Today vulgar
Buddhism has debased Agni (Ak
kini), the god of pure and purifying
fire of the ancient ages, to the sim
ple role of the god of the hearth, with two heads and four hands; but
often (so tenacious is tradition) this
monstrous personage is mounted on Agni’s ram of older times. In China, the ram is still connected with the idea of the propagation of life, which it had in the
oldest European civilizations: the
ritual talisman used to ensure the
happiness of a marriage, in the
sense of its fertility, shows a person
with a ram’s head, printed in black
ink on yellow paper? (Fig. 3).
In Gaul, the ram played an im
portant role in the still largely unknown cult of the Druids: a ram’s head was an attribute of the three
headed god, as we see in the tricephalous divinity in the Carnavalet
Museum in Paris, as well as on a
stele of the Duquenelle collection in
Rheims, and on two other Gallic 68



THE SHEEP
steles found in the same city. In the familial cult of the Gauls the ram was the god of the hearth. The ram also plays a part in the pre-Christian archeology of Germany, Iberia, Italy, and
North Africa®. The marks of favor with which this animal was perceived in all of the ancient world were too obvious to be overlooked by Christian symbolists, who followed suit by admitting it to the hieratic fauna of Christ with almost all the meanings which had been ascribed to it by their predecessors. Like certain other male creatures such as the bull, the stag, and the cock, the ram also was for the fathers of the primitive Church one of the emblems of Christ’s spiritual fertility. The idea of unit
ing it with the idea of the propagation of life was not new in the first Christian centuries. In Egypt the sacred statue of the ram in the temple of Mendes was said to make women fertile, as it was believed in a certain way to contain the soul of Ositis; his name, Ba, is in fact a synonym for the word “soul’.” Sometimes the Greeks and Latins placed the head of a ram, or that of a lion, on the end of certain phallic amulets to represent the force of the reproductive principle with which man is equipped by the grace of Providence®. We must not forget that on the circle of the zodiac, which
it would seem was transmitted from the Chaldeans to the Phoenicians, to the Greeks, and to the Egyptians’, the sign of the Ram, Aries, bestrides the months of March and April, and that of the Bull, Taurus, rules the months of April and
May, thus endowing by successive parts the three months of spring which compose the season when life stirs most strongly in all nature. And over all this love and all this life, whose manifestation is a resurrection as well as a birth, presides the great feast of the Resurrection of Christ. The way in which rams fight head-on, striking their adversaries with their foreheads, made them in the eyes of the Ancients an emblem of courage and warlike strength. And with the ram as with the bull, the unicorn, the buck goat, and the
rhinoceros, the idea of strength and power has been con- 6699



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
nected by age-old symbolism to the horns on its head. It was
these traditional and already very old ideas which gave the
name “ram” to one of the most useful instruments that the
military genius of the Ancients used in sieges, in Asia!° as
well as among the Greeks and the Romans. It was essentially
a heavy wooden beam armed at one end with a ram’s head
made of cast iron or bronze, and hung from its center. It was
swung back and forth to batter down the walls or gates of
cities under siege.
The ram was also taken as the hieroglyph of the divine
voice of the eternal Word, because, says St. Ambrose, the
ewes follow its voice. It is possible in fact that the docility of
the flock in following the voice of the ram, their chief, leader,
and father, made of it even for the ancient pre-Christians the
emblem of the guide of souls towards their eternal destina
tions; and this is perhaps why the very same St. Ambrose says
elsewhere that the ram “is taken as the symbol of the divine
Word even by those who do not believe in the coming of the
Messiah!!.”
The tam, like the lamb and the ewe, was offered as a
bleeding sacrifice to God, and to the gods of all the ancient
peoples; and like the majority of the victims offered in the an
cient sacrifices, it became for the Christians the image of
Christ as victim. This symbol persevered throughout the Mid
dle Ages, according to the testimony of Rabanus Maurus and
the anonymous writer of Clairvaux, who saw in the ram the
Word incarnate offered in sacrifice for our redemption’.
Much earlier, in the mystical commentary on Abraham's
sacrifice on Mt. Moriah, where a ram was substituted for the
patriarch’s son!?, the animal sacrificed in Isaac’s place was
suggested as the figure of Christ slain instead of sinful
humanity.
I would add that in Muslim Morocco, under the name of
“Abraham’s Sacrifice” a feast is still celebrated which includes
the slaughter of a ram under a tent located two or three min
utes from the mosque; as soon as the victim has received the 70



THE SHEEP
death blow it is thrown onto the saddle of a horseman who
dashes off at a gallop to the mosque: if the ram is still alive
when it arrives, the people of the Maghreb say it is a sign of good fortune for the coming year’. Phrixus, the son of the king of Orchomenus, is the Joseph
of Greek mythology. Invited to her bed by Demodice, the
wife of his uncle, the king of Iolcos, Phrixus refused to give
in to her guilty desires, and was then accused by her of hav
ing attempted to force her. Soon thereafter a horrible plague
ravaged the kingdom of Orchomenus, and the oracle, mistak
ing the signs, pronounced that the plague would not cease un
less Phrixus and his sister Helle were sacrificed. But the great Zeus took pity on the innocents, and as they were being led to their deaths, he caused a cloud to envelop them, and within the cloud was a celestial ram, covered with a resplendent golden fleece. Phrixus and his sister seized the beautiful animal with all their strength, recognizing it as their savior; and the ram rose, slowly at first, above the earth and finally, as swiftly as the kite carrying off its prey,
it soared away with its human Fig. 4 17th-century trademark
cargo toward the country of af the Golden’ Fleece. Colchis. But as they were passing over the Euxine Sea, the young Helle, terrified by the noise of a storm which was making the waves boil, let go and fell into the water: this part of the sea has been called the Hellespont ever since. Phrixus, who held fast, was let down gently in Colchis and in a gesture of pious
gratitude, he offered the marvelous ram as a sacrifice, on the altar of Zeus. He hung the golden fleece as homage on a tree consecrated to the god Ares, the war god of the Greeks, and 7711



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
placed nearby a fearful monster, the Dragon of Colchis, to
guard the rich treasure (Fig. 4).
The gods were satisfied with the gratitude of Phrixus and
willed that henceforth the fleece be a pledge insuring abun
dance and good fortune for the place in which it was found.
The ram itself was placed by them in the constellations of the
zodiac, at the head of the months bringing life and joy to the
earth. It was the golden fleece of this savior ram that the hero
Jason and his companions, the Argonauts, would later succeed
in taking from Colchis, by killing, with Medea’s help, the
dragon which guarded it.
In the days when troubadours and minstrels sang our great
epics, the Golden Fleece of the Greek story symbolized, for
“those who knew,” two treasures apparently very different.
The search for it by the Argonauts was seen as foreshadow
ing the “quest for the Holy Grail,” by the Knights of the
Round Table. The Holy Grail was in fact the Eucharist; it
was Christ. On the other hand, for the alchemists the same
enterprise of the Argonauts stood for the search for the phi
losopher’s stone; and this unique stone, so powerful to knowl
edgeable alchemists, was also Christ, hidden within a symbol.
About 1447, Pope Eugene IV represented the conquest of
the Golden Fleece by the Argonauts on the bronze doors of
Saint Peter’s in Rome. Christian spirituality saw in Phrixus
and Helle the image of human souls, and in the celestial ram,
that of Jesus Christ who offers them the possibility of salva
tion by lifting them above the earth by means of its fleece,
that is to say his doctrine and his law. Phrixus holds onto his
savior untiringly, with all his might, and reaches the happy
shores of Colchis; Helle weakens, is discouraged and lets go
of the divine ram, and falls into the abyss where death re
ceives her.
But in Christian art, of all the creatures which have had the
honor of symbolizing Christ, it is the lamb that has been the
most popular, just as in all the sacrificial cults it was the virgi
nal vierim pat excellence: its white color, its grace, its youth 72



THE SHEEP
all marked it for this role, and in the biblical account of the beginnings of the human race, the lamb on Abel’s altar was the first sacrificial offering that the Creator looked upon with favor. We shall see later how its protective and expiatory roles were defined by Moses for the Hebrews; but we quote here the words of Isaiah and Jeremiah that were applied to the person of Jesus Christ as prophecies of his role as redemptive victim: “The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his
mouth!>.” “But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter!®.” Later, recalling these ancient texts, John the Baptist was to say of Jesus as he drew near him in the valley of Jordan, “Behold the Lamb of God!7.” Here are the words of another John, on Patmos: “And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of
the elders, stood a Lamb as it
Fig.5 The Lamb with seven horns had been slain, having seven and seven eyes; 13th century. horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints. And they sung a new
song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and peo
ple, and nation; and hast made us unto our God kings and 7733



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
priests: and we shall reign on the earth!8 (Fig 5).” As expiatory and propitiatory victim,
the lamb was in the first place among
the symbols and emblems of Jesus
Christ. The earliest artists to picture it
in the catacombs seemed to prefer the
aspect of the suffering earthly victim to

dared to represent the cross in the art

lying by a ship’s anchor, a mysterious
hieroglyph for the cross. We see it thus

and even long after it had been freed by Constantine to
emerge into the light of day, the Church did not yet dare to
represent the body of its deity on the Roman instrument of
execution. The lamb was the symbol chosen to take its places
and this was the first crucifix, one might say the pre-crucifix,
for Christians. This custom of placing the lamb on the cross
persisted, in the East as well as the West, long after the
Church had accepted the representation of the cross bearing
the body of Christ (Fig. 8).
As the slain victim, the lamb appears also in other
postures—sometimes standing, or stretched on the ground,
with blood flowing; at others it is on an altar at whose foot
lies the Book spoken of in the Apocalypse*°. In the symbol
ism of Freemasonry, the Lamb lying on the sealed book repre

on the Ark of the Covenant?!. At other times, it is the lance instead of the cross that proclaims the triumph of Christ’s love, since it is the heart that is pierced (Fig. 5). We see it carved like this in ivory on the beautiful Roman crozier at Metten, “the divine Lamb, returned to life, pulls out from its wound the iron that had pierced its heart?? (Fig. 9).” The symbolic compositions which link the lamb’s image with the idea of the Eucharist quite naturally take the mind back to another lamb which, since the time of Moses, the Hebrews consume according to special rites and whose blood ransomed their lives. Scripture recounts how on the eve of the Hebrews’ departure from Egypt, Moses ordered them at the Lord’s command to sacrifice a lamb for each family. Each was to take a male yearling without blemish and kill it in the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, and mark with its blood the doorposts and the lintel of the door of the house within which the roasted flesh of the lamb was to be eaten, with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. “And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the Lord’s passover.”’ And that night the Lord passed over Egypt and smote the first-born of the land, but the houses of the

THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
Hebrews were spared because of the blood of the lamb that
marked their doors. And that very day the children of Israel
went out of Egypt??.
On the eve of that day which is unique among days, Jesus
with his companions had eaten the ritual Passover lamb, the
prophetic symbol of himself; and taking the place of the sym
bol, he had said while he blessed the bread and wine, “Take
ye and eat. This is my body.... Drink ye all of this. For this
is my blood. ...2#” This is why the Church since its earliest
days has seen a connecting link between the Paschal lamb and
the sacrament of the Eucharist,
and St. Paul declared to the
Corinthians, “Christ our pass
over is sacrificed for us: there
fore let us keep the feast”?.”
The divine Lamb is an inex
haustible source of life and also
of light. St. John of Patmos
speaks of this in his book of
Revelation; after describing the
walls of the heavenly Jerusalem
made of precious stones, and Fig. 10 The divine Lamb on the book sealed
the twelve gates of pearl, he with seven seals; 12th century.
adds: “And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Al
mighty and the Lamb are the temple of it. And the city had
no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for
the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light
thereof, And the nations of them that are saved shall walk in
the light of it?6.”
This is undoubtedly the reason why the lamb was some
times represented in the midst of the sun, or crowned with a
halo of rays, or also why a star was sometimes placed before
it.
The lamb, then, was considered as a source of light; and
the light perceptible to the vision is only the image of that
which illnmines the soul and gives it wisdom. This is how it
76



THE SHEEP
has been explained by some learned commentators that the lamb is sometimes seen bearing the lance instead of the cross, as the lance was a symbol of wisdom among the ancients, being associated with Pallas Athena?”. On the other hand, one can also see in this image simply the evocation of the lance which wounded the Redeemer’s side on Calvary, and in Christian iconography both cross and lance evoke above all the Passion of Christ (Fig. 10). As well as representing the redeemer of humanity and its divine illuminator, the lamb in Christian symbolism also fills the role of purifier of the world and king of virgins. St. John presents it at the head of the hundred and forty-four thousand chosen ones “which were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the first fruits unto God and to Fig-d1 The Lamb ina Gown of
the Lamb. And in their mouth flowers, fruits, corn, and grapes;
was found no guile: for they are Sth-century tory from Milan, without fault before the throne of God?8.” King of those who have remained pure, the Lamb is king also of those who having been defiled “have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb?%.”’ This is perhaps what St. Peter was referring to with the words: “Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation... but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot?°.’? The whole iconography of the purifying lamb rests on these texts and similar ones, and they explain the presence of the lamb’s image on liturgical furnishings connected with the rites of purification,
such as some medieval holy water basins and baptismal fonts. 7TT7



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
The apotheosis of the lamb
described by St. John in Revela
tion, standing on Mt. Zion in
the midst of the army of virgins,
provided fruitful themes for the
Christian artists. In the first
centuries, almost the only image
showing the Lamb Triumphant
was that of a lamb standing in +.
the center of the laurel crown Fig. 12 The Lamb raising Lazarus from the dead;
of glory (Fig. 11), or on the
mountain from which issued the four, or five, sources of the
river of life. These representations became much more elabo
rate later.
The triumph of the Lamb had to be followed in Christian
picturing by the recognition of its absolute power, and this
was celebrated by portrayals of the Lamb armed with the rod
of authority. On a tomb of 358 A.D., the Lamb is shown with
a rod making water gush from a rock, blessing or multiplying
the miraculous loaves, and raising Lazarus from the dead
(Fig. 12).
The celestial power of the Lamb seems concentrated in the
Apocalyptic description of it with “seven horns and seven
eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God?!.” As we have al
ready seen, in the language of scripture, and in general in sa
cred iconography, the horn is always the sign of force and of
power; and the number seven is a mysterious number denot
ing fullness.
The Lord himself used the symbol of lambs and sheep to
mean his followers—even the Apostles, to whom he said,
“Behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves?2,”’ and in
committing the care of his flock to Peter: “Feed my
lambs... Feed my sheep?3.”” The sheep as well as the lamb
certainly often stands for the Christian soul, in addition to be
ing incontestably the image of the sacrificed Savior. Like the
ram and the lamb. the ewe was sacrificed on all the altars of
from the 4th-century tomb of St. Peter in Rome.

THE SHEEP
the pre-Christian cults of Europe and Asia, including China, where in the Shan dynasty it was already an old established custom to bury a ewe in honor of the Sun on the mound called “The Royal Palace3+.” A similar offering was made to the Moon on the other mound called “Light of the Night?>.” It would seem that the ewe is the animal whose milk became the symbol for the Eucharist. Certainly it is always a member of the sheep family who carries the vessel of milk, or lies beside it, on many works of art of the first six Christian centuries. To represent milk allegorically in painting and sculpture, the artists of that time made use of the image of

the rustic container used by shepherds for milking the ewes in the pasture, the mulctra of the Latins. It was made of metal or wood, depending on the locality, and had a carrying handle. To identify it in its symbolic sense, the artist usually placed near the vessel one or several lambs or sheep, or the pedum, the shepherd’s crook of the ancient world (Figs. 13 and 14). It is interesting to note that on the early monuments the vessel of milk is accompanied by no other animal than a sheep; so the milk that in its vessel represents the Eucharist is spe- 7799



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
cifically the milk of the ewe, not that of the cow, or the she
goat, or the doe.
Among all the pre-Christian people that we know anything
of, milk was a revered and precious liquid, and nearly all the
ancient religions used it as the perfect ritual substance; it was
poured in libations before the altars more often than blood, or
oil, or liquid honey, and quite as often as wine. From one end
of the ancient world to the other, it was related with the idea
of prosperity and happiness. The book of Exodus says that
when God commanded Moses to lead his people out of Egypt,
he described the country he intended for them as “flowing
with milk and honey?®.” Much later, in the last century of the
pre-Christian era, telling the Romans of the imaginary Golden
Age and the delightful region where dwelt its fortunate peo
ple, the poet Ovid said, “What are now springs of water were
then nearly all fountains of milk, and honey ran down the
trees?7.” The same allegorical idea prevailed in Central Asia,
where the Mongols and Tartars tossed libations of milk to
ward the sky as offerings to the spirits*®; and also in Chaldea,
Persia, and Arabia, where later it would be told how an angel
offered three cups to Mohammed: one of wine, another of
milk, and the third of honey; the Prophet selected the second
and was praised by the angel for his wise choice*?.
We might note that butter, made from the cream of milk,
also became a symbol of abundance and good fortune. In
many places in the Bible, the prophets designate butter and
honey as food for the future Messiah and his saints; and the
sacred books of the Hindus mention it even oftener: “O pow
erful gods,” says the Rig-Veda, “drop your butter on our
cows and your honey on all the worlds*®.”
For the early teachers of the Christian faith, milk had two
principal symbolic meanings: for one, it was the emblem of
the excellent doctrine which nourishes the Christian’s mind,
and for the other, it stood for the Eucharist, the necessary
food for his soul. At one moment of the Church’s early life,
some of its priests adopted milk as a true sacramental sub- 80

stance, and celebrated the holy mysteries with bread and co
agulated milk. They were known by the name of Artotyrites,
(artos, bread, and tyros, dried milk, cheese): they are known to
us through St. Epiphanius, St. Augustine, and Theodorus
Lector*!. The Church forbade the consecration of milk and
its derivatives as a sacrament; however, the Apostolic Tradition,
by St. Hippolitus, who was martyred in 240 A.D., prescribed
an exceptional communion rite that was accepted, at least for
a certain time in Greece. In addition to bread and wine and
the mixture of milk and honey that many churches made use
of at this time, this rite offered a cup of water. The communicants were given successively three cups: first, after the con
secrated bread, the cup of water; then that of milk and honey, and finally that of wine.

THE GOAT
N COUNTRIES UNDER Greek influence, the he-goat was connected with the popular cult of the goddess Artemis, and a buck was offered to her in the ceremonies celebrated every five years in her honor. On the fringe of the Artemis cult, representations of the god Pan, regarded as the universal generator of the procreative power, showed him with the legs, feet, and horns of the he-goat, and sometimes with its whole body!. The actors who distinguished themselves on the stages of the Greek theater, as well as the winners of certain athletic contests, were commonly rewarded with the prize of a goat, and from this came the names tragodos, by which actors were generally called, and tragodia, tragedy, given to the most popular form of theater?. It is interesting that the ancient Scandinavians attached the goat to the chariot of Thor, the god of thunder and lightning?. Some people have thought that the foul odor which is sometimes produced at the moment when lightning appears has something to do with this association; and, perhaps by another association connected with it, it was the former practice in some northern countries to place a goat’s horn, or even a fragment of the animal’s skin, in the top floor of dwellings to protect them from lightning. In the Orient, it was thought that wineskins made from goat hide lent the wine special health-giving properties; and in the eastern Mediterranean re

THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
were sought so eagerly by goats that they were named for the
animal*, were equally sought out by people who used their
seeds for religious and magical rituals.
But rich as the goat’s past history has been in its symbolic,
hieratic, and sacrificial uses, its role in Christian symbolism
stems almost entirely from biblical sources. In many places in
the Pentateuch, Moses orders the immolation of the goat.
The only chapter in the Book of Numbers that codifies sev
eral important liturgies specifies the sacrifice of a goat before
Yahweh>, on ten different occasions, not as an act of adora
tion or of petition, but for the remission of sins. This expia
tory character, clearly defined for each ritual sacrifice of a
goat, has quite naturally made the animal appear as a prophetic figure of the Redeemer.
But it is especially in the role of the scapegoat and its com
panion that the goat has entered into the symbolism of Christ.
According to Leviticus, Moses says that after sacrificing a
bullock, Aaron, the high priest, is to take two goats, one for
Yahweh, the Lord, the other for Azazel, whose name means
“the prince of the demons who have been cast out.” Then he
is to place the two goats before the Lord at the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation. Aaron is to cast lots upon the
two goats, one lot for the Lord and one lot for Azazel; and
he is to bring the goat on which Azazel’s lot has fallen and
present it alive before the Lord to make an expiation upon it
and to let it go for Azazel into the desert.
“Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for
the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with
that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprin
ke it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat....
And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the Lord,
and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of
the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the
horns of the altar round about. And he shall sprinkle of the
blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and
hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel. And 84



THE GOAT
when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live goat: and Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness. And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness®.” The commentators and exegetes of all times have seen in the first of these two animals the emblem of Christ sacrificed to God his Father as ransom for the world, and in the second, the emblem of this same Redeemer become a sort of universal receptacle of evil, the terrible mass of human sin, which he carries away into the desert—that is, into the solitude of his tomb, or, according to another interpretation, toward heaven where the unseen God awaits. Theodorus, Bruno of Asti, Thomas Aquinas and many other writers give this passage from Leviticus mystical interpretations that substantially agree with what I have just said”. Since the beginning of Christianity, the scapegoat, upon which, for the good of the people, rests the accumulation of all their sins, has struck the popular imagination, and we can trace its influence in the customs of our French country folk. The peasants of the western provinces (and doubtless others) often put goats into their stables and barns because, they say, they attract poisonous vapors and the germs of animal maladies, which collect around them without doing them any harm, and thus are kept away from the larger animals. I have observed that several times when the livestock has been decimated by foot-and-mouth disease, the presence of a goat in the stable has in no way prevented the other animals from dying. Nevertheless, when the epidemic is over the peasant simply replaces the goat with another, claiming that the other
animal was in bad condition. 8855



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
Although the young he-goat is a delightful and attractive
animal, as it becomes sexually mature it becomes lustful and a
vile odor begins to emanate from it; soon it becomes a dis
gusting and repugnant creature which one wishes to avoid. In
the same way, according to the mystics, as long as the Chris
tian keeps his heart young and pure, as long as he resists the
lower instincts insofar as nature allows, he remains morally
beautiful; but when the human being abandons himself to the vices of his lower nature, his inner corruption shows itself and points the finger of blame at him in one way or another. Among the ancient Greeks, it was said of libidinous people that they “smelled of goat.” The Gospels also portray the goat as symbol of the accursed. Several centuries earlier Ezekiel had written“Thus saith the Lord GodBehold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he-goats’.” But Christ was even clearer: “When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.” Then, after welcoming the just, he turns to those on his left, and says— “Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels... .°” The he-goat is the special emblem of the King of Hell. All medieval demonologists show Satan almost exclusively in the guise of a buck goat, and if they are to be believed, it is in this form that he presides over his devil’s sabbaths. In the her

THE GOAT
metic groups of the Middle Ages, which very often remained in perfect harmony with the purest concepts of Christian mysticism, the buck was at once the symbol of Satan and of animality. It is on this account that its head still adorns the fivepointed star that is directed downward!©— “the black fallen star” which is the antithesis of the pentagram, the star of spirituality, whose point is toward heaven (Figs. 1 and 2). But as we have said, the goat was not doomed from birth to be scorned by human beings. Among the ancient Greeks, on the contrary, the young he-goat, tragiskos, was one of the symbols of purity, of “whiteness,’’ whatever the color of its coat. It was only when it became an adult buck, tragos, that it lost the esteem of others along with its innocence. It seems also that the same favorable regard, and the same sacrificial rites on the altars of the gods, were accorded to the young of sheep, goats, and even deer; that is, to all the young of the small, horned quadrupeds; further, in the sacred arts of the pre-Christians it was not often possible to distinguish between kids, lambs, and other similar
animals.
In the ancient cults and mysteries—those of Ishtar and Tammuz among the Assyrians, for example, and later in the mysterious theories of the Pythagoreans and the Orphists and in the rites of Dionysus—the kid was the image of the believer initiated into the secret teachings. There was a sacred formula in Orphism, which testified to this, which the Pythagoreans also adopted; the mysterious words that can be read on the two gold plates of Thurii!! (between the fourth and the third centuries B.c.): “Goat, I have fallen in the milk” —or according to Wolgraff— “Goat, I have thrown myself upon the milk,” that is, upon the nourishing breast of di

vinity!2. Here, “milk” surely means the hidden doctrine, issu
ing directly from the masters without being seen by the pro
fane, as milk passes invisibly from the mother’s breast into the
mouth of her young. In the decoration of the Pythagorean ba
silica of the Porta Maggiore, in Rome, we see a bacchante
standing with a kid in her arms which she holds out to an
other woman who is baring her breast for it!?. In the same
way, in the Dionysiac paintings of the villa Item, in Pompeii,
we see a priestess suckling a fawn'*. It is because of instances
of this kind, or of rites unknown to us that were practiced in
Assyria in the mysteries of Ishtar and Tammuz, much earlier
than Pythagorism or Orphism, that the Pentateuch imposed
on the Hebrews (neighbors of the Assyrians) the several
times repeated precept— “Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his
mother’s milk!5.”’ The law of Moses does not contain any
similar edict in relation to the young of any other animal.
In the Far East, the blood of the kid was and still is be
lieved to protect children from night-walking evil spirits. In
China, the kid was always the favored sacrificial victim—Tzu
Fong, in the century before the birth of Christ, offered the
sacrifice of a yellow goat to the god Hantzu-kuo, who had ap
peared to him in a vision; and after that his fortune increased
to the size of a king’s!®.
In the Pentateuch, nothing is specified in regard to the sac
rificial killing of the kid; it follows the rites indicated for
other small livestock. But a particular idea of innocence is
connected with it, as with the other young victims; and it is
this idea of a purity that has remained untouched since its be
ginning that in earlier times caused the kid’s skin to be chosen
instead of other leathers or fabrics for making the pontifical
gloves for ritual use!”. The liturgical texts clearly established
these gloves as one of the special symbols of Christ’s inviol
able purity. This same idea of purity served to make the
young goat the symbol of Jesus Christ as a virginal victim.
The religious history of the kid in Europe before our era
presents it as symbolizing the soul that seeks the divine doc- 88



THE GOAT
trine; but I have not seen any instance of its being regarded as a direct image of divinity. But for Christians, the kid sym
bolizes the figure of Christ the expiator, substituted for us;
and this idea of substitution is expressed also in Exodus. In
the first law stipulated for the Passover, Moses allows the He
brews to substitute a kid for the paschal lamb: “Ye shall take
it out from the sheep, or from the goats!’.” In all the rest of
this same law of the Passover, the text speaks only of a lamb;
the kid is named at the beginning merely as a victim that,
lacking a lamb, could replace it. But in this case, the same
virtue of preservation from “the Destroyer” promised for the
blood of the paschal lamb is implicit in the blood of the kid.
And if the lamb prefigures Christ, so does the kid, since the
blood of one and of the other had the same value and the
same meaning, being consecrated by the same Mosaic rites.
The imagination of the Ancients generously gifted the
blood spurting from the kid’s heart with a very unexpected
property—it had the power to soften the hardest stones, not
excepting diamonds. Up until the middle of the medieval pe
tiod, the lapidaries took account of this property in their cor
porate theories; we have incontestable proof of this from the
pen of the monk Theophilus who wrote at the beginning of
the eleventh century— “If you wish to carve crystal, take a
young he-goat, tie its legs, and make an incision between the
chest and stomach, in the region of the heart, and let the
crystal soak in the blood until it is warm. Carve it then as you
wish, and when it begins to get cold, and to harden, put it
back in the blood....1%” As one may well believe, medieval
spirituality seized upon this belief of the craftsmen to enrich the symbolism of the Savior. In Greek mythology, as we have seen, the white she-goat
Amaltheia was the glorious nurse of the supreme god, Zeus;
and it was one of her horns that Zeus gave to the nymphs. It
was “the horn of plenty’? which became the symbol of all
good things of a spiritual as well as a material nature?°, and the symbol also of their divine source. 8899

It was with a goatskin that Hephaestus covered Pallas
Athena’s shield2!; and it was with the help of the goats of
Parnassus that Apollo showed the devotees of his sanctuary at
Delphi the generative source of the vapors that caused the ec
static trance states in which the Pythonesses received their in
spirations and transmitted the divine oracles”. In ancient
Cretan art, the Mother Goddess appeared in the form of a
she-goat suckling a child??; she is the Earth-Nourisher. In
Syria and Chaldea, the celestial she-goat plays an important
and favored role in opposition to the invisible evil forces
which she puts to flight; an Assyrian bas-relief shows her
chasing a lion-centaur spirit. And
under the aspect of Capricorn, in these same countries, the goat
takes a leading place in the sym
bolism of the sky and of the

of the mysteries. Thus on the northern and eastern shores of the Mediterranean, the Ancients made the she-goat a symbol of initiation. Thus also St. Gregory of Nyssa, who died about 400 a.D., described the she-goat as a symbol of the total perfection and the universality of the searching look with which Christ, in his divinity, sees everything in the past, present, and future?®. The Physiologus, and the medieval bestiaries that derive from it, always relying on the sayings — Fig. 4 4th-century painting of Pliny and the Ancients, also took the from the Roman catacomb she-goat as an emblem of Christ’s om- of Calistus. niscience. And with the same viewpoint, the mystics of that era also made the goat the image of Christ observing from
the heights of heaven the actions of the just and the wicked, for the sake of future rewards and punishments?®. The characteristics of the goat which attract it to the heights could provide other reasons than the excellence of its vision why the goat should be taken as the symbolic image of the Lord. Origen, writing at the beginning of the third century, said that not only is the goat endowed with marvelous
vision, but that it carries in its breast a liquid that can give the same advantage to human beings. “Thus,” he said, “Jesus Christ not only sees God, his Father, but makes him visible also to those whom his word enlightens?”.” On a fresco of the fourth century, in the catacombs of Ca
listus, a leaping gazelle or wild goat carries the caduceus of
Hermes, the god of knowledge, that is hidden from the vul
gar, and mysterious in itself. Who will explain to us the thought of the artist who sketched this astonishing motif?

The medieval hermetists also connect the goat with the person of Christ, applying to it the old pagan meaning, which they christianized, of the zodiacal Capricorn. In ancient esoterism, this was the Janua coeli, the Gate of Heaven, as op

posed to Cancer, which is Janua inferni, the Gate of Hell, and which
is represented in hermetic art by crabs and crustaceans of all sorts. In the art of the catacombs in
Rome, the goat often appears in a purely decorative role; but it is
also found with the sheep around
the Shepherd guarding his flock, as is the case in one of the
big frescos of the catacomb of Domitilius; or again, when it is
shown on each side of the Good Shepherd. There is no doubt
that in both cases the goat is a symbol of the faithful. In the
same way, on an urn of Pesaro, which is of the seventh cen
tury and probably was for baptismal use, two gazelles drink
from the same vessel, a symbol of baptism or of the Eucharist
(Fig. 5). In the Roman catacomb
called “Priscilla’s Cemetery,” the
Good Shepherd carries on his
shoulders not the lost sheep, but a
goat (Fig. 6).
I do not know of a single exam
ple of a goat represented in heral
dry as a certain image of Jesus Christ; the animal had on the whole
a bad reputation in “the noble sci
ence.” In his great work, published
in 1699, Vulson de la Colombiére Fig. 6 The Good Shepherd
speaks of it thus— “The goat and the goats, from the Roman

reason the Athenians banished it from their territory, and
even today it is forbidden to enter several provinces in

which love to be in high places, sometimes signified something

It seems certain that in the time of St. Bernard and St. Louis—the cycle of the pure idea—members of the goat family must have been shown on the seals or coats of arms as symbols of the aspirations of souls in love with the atmosphere of spiritual heights, whence heaven can be looked upon from less far away than in the bottom lands of the valleys.

THE HORSE
HE ROLE PLAYED by the horse in Greek mythology was
Tisch a large one that I cannot hope to set it forth here
in full within the limits of this book. Let us simply take note
that the horse was so closely allied with Poseidon-Neptune
that god and noble animal were often identified with one an
other. The learned Victor Magnien quotes an inscription from
Laconia, thought to be of the fifth century of our era, com
posed in honor of the horse-god Hippios, whose cult was widespread in Greecel.
Poseidon, “god of horses,” as Servius calls him, created the
horse, because the movements of its energy are as rapid and
fluid as the sea waves. The Cretan ships of long ago usually
catried figureheads in the shape of horses, which according to
Reinach represented Poseidon-Hippios’.
In Greek mythology, all the divine horses were sons of the
Winds; for example, Mars’ steeds were born of Boreas and
one of the Furies. And the light of the sun acting on the
earth’s atmosphere, through whose agency the winds are
formed, also enters into these tales. Thus it is that the divine
sun-horse sires offspring as swift as himself, which sometimes
carry mortals toward the sky. All these marvelous stories be
gan as symbols by means of which ancient humanity expressed
its tremendous need for greater light, for a”wider and more
direct knowledge of God.
In Hellas, as it was in many other nations, the horse was
often sacrificed to the divinity. Its blood flowed not only in
94



THE HORSE
honor of Poseidon but also in the temples of Cybele—the Kybele of Berecynthus, the horse-headed goddess, counterpart of Poseidon, who hides perhaps behind the appearance of the forequarters of a horse printed on many Greek coins (Fig. 1). The horse was one of the victims offered to Phoebus Apollo, the divine charioteer of the Sun. And it is a remarkable fact that one of the mystery cults of the Hellenistic region, a little after the seventh century before Christ, sacrificed a horse in a mystic ceremony in which each initiate covered himself with a horsehide before taking part in the ritual consumption of the victim’s flesh, in order to identify himself more closely with it and the deity it represented. Many Greek coins, and some others, carry the horse’s whole image, some placed under a star with rays? (Fig. 2). Coins of the Carthaginian armies in Sicily, showing Greek influence, represent the horse with the Fig. 1 Coin of Heraclea. palm tree, which was a symbol of life and of resurrection for the ancient world in general, as it was in primitive Christianity (Fig. 1). Greek metaphysics and theologies considered the earth, the universe, and the human being as formed on the same model, with their thought, nous, their ardor, thymos, their principle of life and passion, epithymia, and their various breathings, pneumata. Their theology supplied the Greeks with an image of the soul symbolized by a team of horses, as Plato expresses it in the Phaedrus; but Hermias says that Plato took this symbolic comparison from older poets who were inspired by the Divinity, such as Homer, Orpheus, and Parmenides. The driver of this team represents the directing Thought, and the two horses are spiritual Ardor and human Desire‘. Rudolph Steiner, commenting on Plato, explained the symbolic team in this way: One of the horses is patient and wise,

the other wild and rebellious; if the chariot meets an obstacle,
the rebellious horse makes use of it to hinder his teammate
and go against the driver. If the disobedient one is the
stronger of the two, the chariot cannot follow the direction of
the gods; but if the obedient horse is the stronger, the chariot
will be able to enter the suprasensible world. So it is that the
soul can never reach the kingdom of heaven without a
struggle.
More simply, the informed Catholic sees in the symbolic
equipage the picture of his soul borne along all his life by the
two horses, the good and evil tendencies in himself; one that
wishes to follow the way that is right and good, the other that
wishes to turn aside into the paths of perdition. He looks to
the driver, his conscience, to direct and maintain the chariot
always according to that impartiality that is the sum total of
human duty: the spiritual health and saintliness that he wishes
to acquire are formed only from that.
It is well known that the horse played a very big role in re
ligion and symbolism among the Gauls, as it did in all the
western and northern countries. The data of prehistoric
archeology shows that the ancient tribes of our part of the
world believed that a principle of the divine nature existed in
the horse. Did they think, as the people of Asia thought, that
the sacred horse like a divine Messiah “descended straight
from heaven to be sacrificed®’? How can we explain the
bones of more than forty thousand horses heaped together at
the foot of the rock at Solutré?
Gaul also recognized a goddess Epona whose characteristics
were similar to those of Cybele, the counterpart of the Greek
Poseidon, who is equivalent to Demeter, the universal Earth
Mother. Some statuettes discovered at Alesia (near Dijon)
show Epona seated, with her hand on the head or neck of the
figure of a horse smaller than herself ©. Théte were certainly
points of contact between the Druids and the high priesthood
of the Greeks which declared themselves in exchanges of
more or less strong religious influences. 96



THE HORSE
In Spain, the beginning of the Iron Age gave us ornaments in the shape of a horse, with or without a rider, devouring a human head or a small indefinable monster (Fig. 3). The suggestion that has been made that this is the image of a horseman-god peculiar to the , G) Iberians’? seems fanciful, since some of them are riderless; and it would perhaps be less risky to suppose that they might represent the light of the sun destroying the darkness of night. Esaias Tegner says that among the Scandinavian countries, the preferred victim for auguries was the horse, whose still-quivering entrails were anxiously examined for omens’. Well before Christianity, the horse was worshipped among the Slavs, and survivals of cee this cult lingered on in the region
Fig. 3 Prehistoric Iberian ornaments. of Triglaw and Volyn where the
living animal was considered a national god and whose states were taken as oracles. This cult
was definitely abolished only by the apostolate of the holy Bishop Otto of Bamberg?. In Tibet, to this day, the cult of Kwan-on, the horse
headed god, is widespread—it can be found from Mongolia to
Japan; and Hayagriva, the god with a horse’s neck, is some
times shown with a small horse-head in his hair!°. In the my
thology of China, heaven is populated by a number of horses of higher and lower grades of divinity. It is worth noting that the conventional idea of the old
world symbolists was that the mounted horse was one of the
ideograms for Wisdom, represented by the horseman, and Intelligence, in the image of the horse; in Egypt, Portal says,
the symbol was translated as: to bestow Intelligence!. In Gal- 9OF7



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
lic mythology, horse and rider were joined as a huge snake
tailed monster symbolizing the earth, carrying the sky on its
shoulders.
In Christian iconography, it is rare to find representations
of the horse alone that is given the attributes of Christ. The
symbolic horse usually has a rider, and here also the two to
gether form one image. Our forefathers connected them all
the more teadily because of the close association of the two in
their daily life; very often, especially in the first millennium of
our era, one grave received both horse and master. I have
seen this with my own eyes in many different places. But in
the Church’s symbolism in medieval times, at least in the
West, the mounted horse represented Jesus Christ, God and
man, the animal corresponding to his humanity and the rider
to his divinity. The iconographers Cloquet and Monsignor
Barbier de Montault echo this symbolism!? which we find
again in the centaur, and which was expressed by Rabanus
Maurus, the ninth-century Archbishop of Mainz; he said that
the white horse of the Apocalypse represents the humanity of
Christ, whose radiance extends over every blessed being:
Equus est humanitas Christi: ut in Apocalypti, Ecce equus albus Id est, caro Christi omni Sanctificate fulgens'.
Here it might be remarked that among the Ancients almost
all the sacred or miraculous horses were white. In circum
stances of great solemnity it was a white horse that was sacri
ficed, as was a black bull. And Chinese poetry tells of the
miracle of the horsehide and the heavenly lady with a horse’s
head!+. The holy books of Judaism describe as “horses of

THE HORSE
hitched to the chariot of Apollo the Sun. In Samaria and Phoenicia were the divine horses Anamelech and Adramelech. The color of the horse’s coat was also given a special meaning in the mysticism and hermeticism of the Middle Ages: the white horse is ridden by the virgin heroes of spotless conscience, and also by the glorious saints. When it car
ries Christ it presents him as the victorious king ruling over
the world, hell, and death in an atmosphere of triumphant
apotheosis. In all medieval art, the color russet is equivalent to bright ted, the color of blood. The russet or sorrel horse seen in the
illuminated manuscripts and stained glass windows of this time
has two meanings: it is the mount of Christ as redeemer and victim, whose blood was shed for mankind, and also of Christ
the judge, avenger of divine rights abrogated by the forces of evil. In both cases, the Savior is dressed in red and his horse is russet, stained with the blood of the victim, and also be
cause the red robe has been for centuries that of the sov
ereign judge who has the power to inflict death. Symbolism
gives pale and black horses a negative meaning!’. Angelo de
Gubernatis says that in various traditions of Europe and Asia
the black horse indicates the demonic. In the West, it signifies
Satan, or any influence that draws man down toward hell!. In
medieval legends, Satan always bestrides a black charger when
he puts on the aspect of an evil knight. In the old paintings,
the horses of traitors and magicians are also black; and very often, so is the rearing horse which represents Intractability; its rider, which it throws off, personifies Presumption!?.
We find again the representation of the infernal horse in
one of the poems which the Middle Ages dedicated to the
Holy Grail. In La Queste del Saint Graal, attributed to Walter
Map, the naiveté of the hero Percival prevents him from rec
ognizing Satan who comes to him in the guise of a huge black
charger.
We read in the first chapter of the prophecy of Zechariah: 9999



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
“T saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse,
and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom;
and behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white.
Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that
talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these be.
And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and
said, These are they that the Lord hath sent to walk to and
fro through the earth. And they answered the angel of the
Lord that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have
walked to and fro through the earth, and behold, all the earth
sitteth still, and is at rest”°.”
Commentators on the scriptures have seen the prophetic
image of Jesus Christ in the man on the red horse who stood
among the myrtle trees at the head of a company of angels,
whom the prophet himself calls “the angel of the Lord.”
In one of St. John’ visions on the island of Patmos, a book
appeared to him that was sealed with seven seals, which only
the divine Lamb could break. And at the breaking of the first
of the seven, “behold a white horse, and he that sat on him
had a bow, and a crown was given unto him, and he went
forth conquering, and to conquer?!.”
At the breaking of the second seal, a red horse appeared,
mounted by a man armed with a sword to whom was given
the power to spread warfare over the earth. The third seal re
vealed a black horse whose rider carried a balancing scale;
and the fourth seal brought a pale horse ridden by Death, and
Hell followed him??.
Of the four mounted horses appearing in the terror of this
vision Christian symbolism has kept only the first, the white
horse, as the image of the victorious Christ. Astride his white
steed, he carries a bow, and this projecting weapon, along
with its accompanying arrow, in the literary symbolism of the
holy scriptures, stands for the Word of the Lord.
In another vision, St. John again describes a horseman on a
white horse: “And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white
horse: and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, 100



THE HORSE
and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. His eyes
were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.
And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his
name is called The Word of God. And the armies which were
in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine
linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall
rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of
the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF
KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS?3.”
It is the grandest of all the symbolic pictures of the power
ful and triumphant Christ, and much loved by all the illumina
tors of medieval copies of the Apocalypse. I reproduce here
(Fig. 4) the beautiful miniature from the Commentary on the
Apocalypse by Beatus of Liebana, from the twelfth or thir

teenth century. The artist has added a lance, the favorite
knightly weapon of those days, to the sword of the Word,
which is fashioned like those of good King Philip’s barons;
and the huge, multiform halo which crowns the divine horse
man replaces to advantage the multiple crowns which other
artists have piled upon his head. The white horse also reminds us of
the Anamelech of the hermetists. Eliphas Lévi tells us that there is a connection of allegorical meaning with
“the Word of beauty.” And even for many of the kabbalists, the generating
Word of true beauty, of radiant celes
tial light, is the Messiah, is Christ. Lévi represents Anamelech (Fig. 5)
with forepart raised on the globe of
the world, the whinnying head lifted
and crowned with a globular diadem
circled with acanthus leaves. His body
is mysteriously veiled in a rich drapery with a clasp at the breast in the shape of the symbolic marguerite of the East
and the North, which after playing an
analogous role in the ancient religions
became one of the Christian emblems of the divine Word and
its radiating beams on earth?*. Lévi does not state the origin
of the strange drawing of Anamelech that he shows, nor the
basis of the symbolic meaning he attributes to him. One of its
less enigmatic aspects is that, like the arrow that in the scrip
tural books, in Christian symbology and in the Kabbalah of
the Jews, was one of the most frequently used symbols of
God’s Word, the horse also is one of the emblems of speed,
of the outgoing force of the Word. Every thought, whether
human or divine, needs a word, a voice, to express it; this

THE HORSE
be translated by the words: “the king’s oracle.” Historically, the horse-god was worshipped in the Syrophoenician region, at Sepharvaim and in Samaria, long before our era, conjointly with his brother Adramelech, “the king’s
robe26.” Long before the Christian era, the imagination of the Cretans and the people of Hellas conceived of an evil monster with the head of a horse, the body of a bird, and the paws of a lion. It was one of the emblems of the evil spirit. A number of stone engravings show this creature carrying off to its infernal den a lion that it has killed or perhaps a deer, an antelope, or a mountain sheep’. Christian symbology also, when it looked on the dark side of the horse, made it an image of Satan, the Lord of Evil; St. Augustine already in the fourth century saw in it one of the personifications of pride; St. Gregory looked upon it as the symbol of impurity and of a disorderly life, and St. Jerome agreed and made the horse the

A sculpture from the church at Montivilliers, in the diocese of Rouen, offers one of the most beautiful examples of these libidinous monsters (Fig. 6). I said before that the Phoenician amulets shaped like bulls’ heads were connected with an ancient cult of the Moon, on account of the crescent shape of the bulls’ horns. I must add here that the talismanic character given in some countries to horseshoes comes from the same lunar cult. A little-known religious idea was also related to horseshoes in western Gaul
in the time of the Roman conquest. Parenteau and I have 103

OTHING IS MORE arbitrary than the scale set up by hu
man beings of the degrees of dignity of animals. These
vary to such an extent in different countries and in different
times as sometimes to contradict each other completely. Thus,
in the Occident the ass was at all times too little valued, while
in the ancient Orient it was always held in very high esteem.
The ancient Greeks linked the ass to the cult of Ceres, and
then to that of Dionysus, who was carried by donkeys to
Thebes from Boeotia!; hence the stone statue dedicated to
the donkey in the town of Nauplia”. Ritual immolations of the
ass in honor of the divinity, although rare, were practiced
since very early times. Initiates of the participating cults, like
the worshippers of the lion and the horse, wore the skin of
the venerated animal during the sacrificial ceremonies’. A
Mycenaean painting shows a procession of personages with
donkeys’ heads, and Glotz says that these are not monsters
created by the artist’s fantasy, but men costumed in sacred an
imal skins for the enactment of a holy rite. On a plaque from
Phaistos, these same ass-headed figures hold in one hand the
cross with a handle (the ankh or key of life of the Egyptians),
and with the other hand make a gesture of adoration*. At
Lampsacus, the Greeks sacrificed asses to Priapus”.
In Rome, the ass played an honored partyin the liturgy of
the cult of Vesta, where it appeared crowned with flowers and
little loaves made of wheat flourS. In Egypt, it had an impor
tant role in the religious myth of Set. The sacred books of 106



THE ASS
the Hindus, the Rig-Veda, for example, praise the asses of Indra, and in India as in China this animal is often the mount of celestial individuals, princes, saints, and heroes’. And it should be remembered that Homer compares Ajax to an ass, and Paris to a horse®! In the injunctions of the Mosaic law the ass is the only animal whose firstborn, like that of the human being, can be ransomed at birth by the sacrifice of a lamb. We read in Exodus: “All that openeth the matrix is mine, and every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male. But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty?.” The Bible presents the donkey as the mount of princes: “Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way,’’ sang Deborah to the leaders of Israel!°. : Tt was as he went in search of the she-asses of the herds of his father, Kish, that Saul learned from Samuel that he was to reign over Israel!!. Zechariah presents the Messiah as the King of Peace in these ardent terms: “Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion: shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation: lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass!2.”” This prophetic text was recalled by the Evangelists themselves when they described Jesus’ triumphal entry into Jerusalem. More than any of the domestic animals, the ass seems to have been close to the person of Jesus Christ. The Gospel of the Infancy, the apocryphal Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, and other writings of the first Christian centuries depict it as being present with the ox at the birth of Christ in the stable at Bethlehem. It seems that this specific mention comes from the concern to bring into the account of Christ’s birth this verse
from Isaiah: “The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his mas- 110077

ter’s crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider!3.” From the fourth to the sixth centuries we see the ass

Nativity. Around the same time, other works of art show us the donkey carrying Jesus and Mary on the flight to Egypt; and finally, history tells us how Jesus’ triumphal entry into Jerusalem, mounted on a sheass, fulfilled the prophecy made by Isaiah that was just quoted. Simple Christians have had no difficulty in making the ass a sympathetic emblem of Christ, and have warmly honored the donkey of the Bethlehem stable, the mount of the \ journey to Egypt, and the she-ass and her foal of the triumph of the Day of Palms. Very ancient legends in France, Spain, and Italy, tell how the Savior rewarded the latter by allowing their offspring to become that kind of gray donkey that has two lines of dark hair in the form of a cross on its back and shoulders. In
the tradition of our western French provinces, the gray ass
marked with the long, dark dorsal cross is a symbol of the
Savior carrying the cross of Calvary on his shoulders. A simi
lar idea in the early church in Egypt related to the beetle, on
whose back the separate lines of the corselet and wing sheaths
trace a Tau, T'4. Hungarian legends put a great strain on the
gospel texts by claiming that the cruciform dorsal stripes on
the gray ass were made by spurts of the divine blood at the scene of the Crucifixion. It should be added, on the other side
of the picture, that in certain parts of Ireland folk say that 108



THE ASS
the donkey’s stripes are vestiges of the whiplashes that Jesus had to give his disobedient mount. Because of its historical role of carrying Christ, in some
countries the ass has received the title of Christophore,
Christ-Bearer, from which comes the name Christopher. The
same name was given in very ancient times in these same
places to holy men who maintained among their fellows the teaching and the spirit of Christ (Fig. 1). Although it has been so stated, the Western Middle Ages were far from being the inventors of the grotesque motif with which many of their important churches were adorned: an ass playing a lyre, a harp, or a viol. The ancient Egyptians had long ago drawn on their papyri asses standing on their hind legs and playing the harp!*. Several thousand years before our era, the Chaldeans had carved this satirical subject on a decorated plaque, found in the recent excavations at Ur, Abraham’s country!® (Fig. 2). In the Occident, the donkey-musician primarily represented Absurdity. In the domain of medieval spirituality, absurdity, which darkens men’s souls, can be nothing but the action of an agent of hell, who is wee called the demon of pride or of self-will. 2 The ass musician The donkey-musician can be seen in the ”* suey pe) cathedrals of Chartres and of Nantes, in the church of Saint
Sauveur at Nevers, and several others. Sometimes the donkey
is replaced by a goat or a pig, but even when the animal is different the symbolic meaning remains the same. The Christian Middle Ages made the ass the symbol of the stubborn mentality that will not let itself be convinced by the truth. This is why the Germans of Westphalia made it the symbol of St. Thomas, the doubter!”. Among the Ancients, the myth of Midas corresponded in a certain way with this symbolism of blind obstinacy. 109
109



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
As well as being the symbol for stubbornness and igno
rance, the donkey also served in medieval imagery as mount
for the demon of sloth. Thus we see him in numerous pro
cessions of the personified deadly sins!®.
On the other hand, the red donkey sometimes directly rep
resented the Evil Spirit. In a number of countries, it is still
said of an evil and dangerous person
that “he is a red donkey.” Formerly in
Egypt red donkeys were sacrificed to
the evil gods Set and Typhon. The
whole Near East and India!? also connects the red ass with evil; and certain
occidental legends of sorcery claim that Satan sometimes is incarnated in the
body of a red ass. Fortunately, red asses are very rare! Fig. 3 The stylized Rempham In the Kabbalah, the accursed five
at Obie branched star Rempham, pointing
downward, which Eliphas Lévi says is a symbol of Lucifer,
carries between its branches the natural or stylized head of an
ass2° (Fig. 3). This infernal star calls to mind the one pic
tured in the chapter discussing the symbolism of the buck
goat, which carries the goat’s head in place of that of the
ass?)
These facts are little known, and taking everything into ac
count, the donkey has not too much to complain of in its
treatment by Christian history, which has not failed to recog
nize either its evangelical functions nor its own special quali
ties. The only negative connotations are with characteristics
with which it was already endowed by the symbolism of times before our era.

THE DOG
HE DOG RECEIVED little sympathy from the people of the
T ancient world, and many terrible scriptural texts spoke
against it. David described thus his situation with his enemies:
“For dogs have compassed me!”; and the Church has heard
this cry echoed by Christ persecuted by the Jewish priesthood.
Solomon’s words, “As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool
returneth to his folly2,” have been constantly applied by the
Church to the worst renegades and backsliders. Jesus himself
taught that the children’s bread must not be given to the
dogs?, and St. Thomas Aquinas remembered these words
when he wrote the non mittendus canibus of his Lauda Sion‘.
The book of Revelation groups under the title “dogs” those
to be chased from the celestial city: “sorcerers, and
whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever
loveth and maketh a lie®.” The ancient Greeks made the dog
the emblem, if not the very origin, of the classical philosophy
of Cynicism, kynismos®.
Another factor that counted against the unfortunate animal
was that the annual periods of greatest heat were suffered un
der the influence of the stars forming the constellation of
Canis Major (July twenty-second to August twenty-third).
The ancient world, except for Egypt and Ethiopia, attributed
to the period of the dog-days the most disastrous effects. Me
dicinal remedies lost their efficacy; Hippocrates himself made
the statement: “Sub cane et ante canem difficiles sunt purga
tiones.”” At such times there was nothing to do but commend 112



THE DOG
the sick to the mercy of the gods, and accordingly the Romans annually sacrificed a red dog at the beginning of the dog-days. It is strange that the cheetah, which is in many ways similar, should have enjoyed a position in Christian symbolism that it seems should rightly have been reserved for the dog, which is man’s particular and devoted friend, defends him and often saves his life”. Christian art did render the dog justice in making it symbolize fidelity in all its aspects. In this role it lies at the feet of the effigies of queens and ladies of quality in their burial vaults, and also under the feet of vassal lords and faithful squires®; and in St. Peter’s Church in Rome, the dog’s image accompanies the statue of Fidelity personified. Since it is also the devoted guardian and defender of the flocks, Christian symbolism has made the dog the emblem of priests of all orders, who are appointed to be caretakers of Christ’s human flock. It is thus that the canes dominici are shown in the fourteenth-century Spanish chapel in Florence, and on an old reliquary of the Filles de Notre-Dame at
Naumur?. But never was the dog given the honor of representing Christ himself.

THE DEER
ON OF THE symbolic animals that the early Christians adopted with the most certainty as an allegorical image of Christ, and also of his disciple, the Christian, was the stag. Poets and naturalists of ancient times, such as Pliny, Theophrastus, Xenophon, Martial, Lucretius!, and many others, portrayed the stag as the implacable enemy of snakes, pursuing them relentlessly into their holes. Martial and Plutarch add that with the breath of its nostrils—some say, of its mouth—the stag would drive the snakes from their under
ground hiding places and devour them, and that in this way its youth was renewed. Reflecting this ancient belief, a Roman marble relief (Fig. 1) from the Naples Museum shows a stag fighting with a snake. The stag has fallen on its knees, but it has succeeded in seizing its enemy’s head in its mouth and is crushing it between its teeth. In Afghanistan today there is a species of the deer or goat family that attacks serpents and often eats them. The Persians call these animals “pausens?.”’ Fig. 1 Pre-Christian Roman marble The last Mazdeans living in that from the Naples Museum. region consider the duel between pausen and snake as the allegorical image of the triumph of good, or “Ormuzd,” over evil, “Ahriman.” But since the pausen often suffers from gall or 117 |

kidney stones, it is killed in order to obtain them as potent
charms against the bites of snakes and the stings of scorpions.
Medieval manuals are full of accounts of the stag’ ingen
ious methods for forcing his enemy to come out of hiding.
The Armenian Bestiary tells us: “The stag is the enemy of the
serpent. To escape him, the snake hides in the crevice of a
rock. But the stag fills up his mouth with water and spits it
out into the crack where the reptile is hiding (Fig. 2). If it
comes out it is torn to pieces; if it stays hidden it does not
escape death, for it is drowned. In the same way, our Lord
put to death the demon, the great dragon, both by the celes
tial waters flowing from his di
vine wisdom, and by his inef
fable virtue. The invisible ser
pent cannot resist waters of
this nature, but perishes at
once?.””
Thus making the stag the
symbol of the — triumphant
Christ, the Ancients saw the
water expelled from its mouth

Lord’s victorious Word. In the liturgies of the ancient myster
ies, deerskins were consecrated as a sort of ritual garment of
purification that brought the initiate closer and made him
more acceptable to the god. In the Greek rites of Dionysus
the participants covered themselves with deerskins, and
Nonnus portrays the god himself clad in this fashion*. In the
mysteries of Ceres celebrated at Eleusis, fawns and kids were
sacrificed and the participants were draped with the skins of
the young victims’. In the first century A.D. Pliny seriously
advised a sure protection from snakes, to be’ found by sleep
ing under a deerskin or by rubbing oneself with the stomach
lining of an unborn fawn®. And in 1568, Jacques du Fouilloux

THE DEER
ties of cures provided by the deer for all kinds of ailments and injuries, especially from snake venom’. Not only can the stag heal others after its death, but it can also in its own lifetime cure itself. According to the Ancients, we are indebted to it for the discovery of dittany, the miraculous herb that cures all wounds. “The wounded deer,” says Tertullian, “in order to expel a barbed arrow from its flesh, heals itself by browsing on dittany’.”” The celebrated Greek physician Dioscorides states that in his time dittany was called Cervi ocellum (little eye of the deer)?. There is a concept in Europe which I think is even older than the tradition of the stag’s hatred for the serpent, which
relates the stag to the idea, or one might say the cult, of
light.
Pre-Mycenaean art quite often shows a stag harnessed to a solar chariot. According to Déchelette, it seems that the idea of the stag sharing this privilege with the horse is also echoed in Greek mythology, which consecrates the stag to Artemis,
born with her brother Apollo on the island of Delos and
sharing his nature!®. We also know that the fawn was a special symbol attributed to Apollo, who was himself the god of light; and Pausanius tells of certain statues which depict Apollo carrying a tiny fawn in his hand!!, Similar statues can be found in the Louvre and the British Museum. One of them is from the sixth century B.c., from a Greek school, another is the hand of a large bronze statue of Apollo found at Tralles (Fig. 3). In ancient European symbolism, the white stag shared the special importance of the white horse. Deer pictured in the myths of Apollo and Artemis, or later in the miraculous hunts of St. Eustace and St. Hubert, were painted by the early artists in natural tones or in white. “It is a known fact,’’ says
Lanoé-Villéne, “that the white stag was a symbol which the
early Christians attributed to Jesus Christ!*.” In the East the white stag is also very highly honored and one of the hymns
of the Rig-Veda compares it with a priest-god!3. 119

It seems that another trace of the ancient European tradi
tions that link the stag to the idea of light remained mysteri
ously hidden among the many medieval documents in which
one sees the stag, or simply his head, crowned with a star. For
one example, the fifteenth-century tile pavement of the Beaune
hospice shows a full face view of a stag’s head surmounted by
a star, recalling the Orphic Hymn to Dionysus, in which the
god is named “Prince of the Mysteries of the
Night”; for another, the thirteenth-century seal of
Heliot Bertaut bears a stylized stag’s head sur
mounted by the glorifying sign of the sun and
moon, which in the Middle Ages was usually re
served for specific images of Christ'* (Fig. 4). In Fig. 4 The seal of
the “Golden Legend” of the only existing occiden- —Heliot Bertaut.
tal hagiography, several well-known hunting scenes show
Christ taking the form of a stag, in order to reveal himself in
this manner to chosen souls. The best-known are the hunts of
St. Hubert and St. Eustace.
A very old French tale gives the following account of the
second of the two saints: There was a man named Placidus
wha wae a nagan. but all the same a man of virtue, filled with 120

THE DEER
kindness for all who suffered misfortune. One day when he and his friends were out
hunting, a band of magnificent stags ap
peared. Soon Placidus left his companions
and launched headlong into the pursuit of
the biggest and most beautiful stag, which
had pulled away from the rest of the
band. After a wild chase the stag suddenly
leapt to the top of a rock and faced the
hunter, saying: “Placidus, why do you not
follow me into the heights? I am Christ
who loves you and whom you serve with
out yet knowing it. Your offerings and
is why I made myself into a splendid stag, (5ih ceubiry, noni the
to draw you to me.” Cluny Museum.
“Beautiful Stag, if you are the Christ of such great fame,
explain your words and I will believe in you,” answered
Placidus.
The divine Stag replied, “I am the Christ; I became man
and died on the cross; and after three days in the shadow of
the tomb I rose to everlasting life. And now I am waiting for
you. Come to me, Placidus; I am Christ!”? And before the
pagan’s astonished eyes, the stag grew to immense proportions
and soon merged into a dazzling blaze of light, in which ap
peared a crucified man whose heart and four limbs bled; then,
little by little, the rock became bare and stark as it had been
before. Placidus went away, abandoned everything, even his
given name, and gave himself totally to Christ, who had il
lumined his soul by means of the miraculous stag.
The same legend, beautifully portrayed in the portal frieze
of the royal chapel of the Chateau d’Ambroise which was
sculpted in the late fifteenth century, is attributed to St.
Hubert by several other authors of antiquity!? (Fig. 5).

THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
Holy Grail. We read that when the three illustrious knights
and companions of the Round Table, Galahad, Percival, and
Bors, and the maiden She-Who-Cannot-Tell-A-Lie, were
seeking their way and prayed for guidance, they saw a stag
whiter than the whitest meadow flowers emerge from the
woods bordering the path; two lions walked before him and
two behind. The knights and the maid followed the magical
animal and soon were led into a sanctuary where a priest pre
pared to say mass. Hardly had he begun when before their
wondering eyes the stag changed into a
man and seated himself on a richly deco
tated throne above the altar, while the four
lions were also transformed, the first into a
winged man, the second into an eagle, the
third into a winged lion, and the fourth into
a winged bull. When the mass was finished,
all four lifted up the throne where the man
who had been a stag was seated, and flew
away through the stained glass window
without breaking a single pane. Then the
three knights and their companion realized
that the stag and the four lions who had
led them there were really the Christ and
his four Evangelists!°.
The stag is also a Gallic symbol; in Gal

Ere as ification of the divine bestowal of worldly
goods he is most often shown in human form crowned with
the spreading antlers of a stag.
It should be noted that in certain other European and
Asian countries the stag is also connected with the idea of
falfillment and contentment. In Chinese, the® character for the
stag’s name, lu, is pronounced like the character for the enjoy
ment of prosperity, and is the ideogram for this desirable condition!®.
122



THE DEER
The stag shares with the bull and the ram the honor of representing Jesus Christ in his three-fold capacity of father, leader, and guide watching over the Christian family, which is made up of his spouse the Church, and the faithful, who are their children. In the forest, his behavior in fact confirms this symbolism: as the leader of his herd of does and fawns, he is a fine sight as he stands among the trees, watching and listening, ready to alert his family to the slightest sign of danger. Among the stranger remedies that ancient medicine bor
rowed from the stag were several related
to human procreation. Even as late as the eighteenth century, a powdered concoction made from the stag’ genital organs was still used to increase the generative powers!?. But it is even better to prolong life than to create it, and throughout the old world the stag was one of the symbols of longevity. Thus, in ancient Europe, Ausonius recounted:
“The raven lives for three centuries, but
even if she lived three times nine complete centuries, the bronze-hoofed stag would surpass her by three times three of Nestor’s lifetimes?°.” In Asia too the Fig. 7 The stag as the Chinese stag was a symbol of long life; notably, symbol of longevity: a vase from in China and Japan the god of long life the Cernuschi collection. is accompanied by a stag carrying “a branch from the peach tree of longevity (Fig. 7).” The first words of the 42nd Psalm gave early Christian symbolism the image of the stag as a symbol of the faithful soul aspiring to God: “As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God.” The same text: “Sicut cervus desiderat ad fontes...” appears on a mosaic in the old baptistry of Salone, mounted above two great stags drinking
together from the sacred urn?!. 128

Other examples in the works of the early Christian artists
porttay stags leaning over the waters of the Jordan, where
Jesus received his baptism from John, as is shown on a fresco
in the Roman catacombs at Pontien??. In each of these works
from the first five centuries of Christian art it is primarily the
thirst for nearness to God through the purification of baptism
which is symbolized; and then also the thirst for a closer
union through partaking of the Eucharistic blood.
The connections between the symbolic stag and the sacra
ment of the Eucharist are especially evident in a great many
works of art dating from the first centuries of Christianity,
such as the expressive mosaics of Bir-Ftouha (Fig. 8) and a
pottery lamp found at Tebessa (third to fifth century) on
which is depicted a stag placed above the communion chal
ice?>.
All of these examples convey the quenching of the soul’s
thirst, which is symbolized by the stag, through the sacrament
of the Eucharist, following the symbolism set forth in the
psalm of David quoted above.
Many works of art from the first Christian millennium show
the stag and the doe, one on each side of the Fountain of
Life; others show them drinking from the four living rivers
that flow from the hilltop of the triumphant Lamb of God. A
10 Naeeh Afeican masaic also shows the two con- 124

tented animals drinking from the four rivers of the Mount,
whose common source is surrounded by a great Eucharistic
chalice filled with blood?4. In Ravenna there is a sarcophagus from the fourth or fifth century on which the stag and the doe drink directly from a huge Eucharistic urn?’ (Fig. 9). On
all of these works of art, and many others from the early cen
turies of Christianity, we are given the most beautiful symbol
of conjugal and Christian life ever conceived: a husband and wife drawing comfort from the same source of faith.

THE PANTHER
And other Wildcats, also the Hyena and the Mole
HE PEOPLE OF ancient Egypt greatly admired and were strongly attracted by the very beautiful wild animal called the panther, and endowed this splendid creature with all sorts of unusual and excellent qualities to an exaggerated degree. Their veneration was expressed in the use of the panther’s magnificent fur and also the nebris, the skin of the panther cub, by the priests in the most sacred rites, and by their masters the pharaohs in the holiest and most solemn events of their royal and priestly lives (Fig. 1). The nebris also appears to have been used in the regular liturgy and in the mystery ceremonies. The panther skins placed before Osiris or Anubis were from flawless animals, ritually sacrificed. The skin of the panther cub served too as a garment or wrap for Anubis, god of the dead, thus connecting him with the idea of a second birth. In funeral rites, the panther’s skin was used as a bed for the deceased and provided “a good burial.”

circumstances, a symbol of strength and of resurrection’.
It is generally believed that the unshorn pelts of certain
wild animals are strongly charged with electrical or magnetic
elements. In France, the furs of foxes and several of the small
cats are still used to ward off lumbago. To cite only one ex
ample, recently the Grands Magasins du Louvre in Paris sold
“guaranteed genuine wildcats’ skins for use in bandages for
the treatment of rheumatism.”
On another level, the Egyptians regarded the panther’s skin
as a powerful source of emanations of a higher kind, and their
priests believed in its magical and spiritual effect. The same
opinion was held by the ancient priests in Greece, Asia
Minor, and from Central Asia to the Far East. In Greek art
and mythology it was in turn adopted as a robe for Dionysus
or Bacchus, and in certain bronze figurines
one sees the graceful animal entwined with
ivy or leafy branches of the grapevine dedi
cated to this god* (Fig. 4). Nonnus states
that panthers were often harnessed to the
chariot of this same god?; and here we en
counter the most sublime aspect of Di
onysus, which made him one of the images
of the divine Word among the Greeks, and
by means of which certain allegorical com

the Word” in the form of the child Dionysus bearing wings and crowned with leaves; with one finger he points to his mouth, the instrument of the Word, while in his other hand he carries a horn of plenty filled with grapes®. The Phoenicians or Sidonians gave the panther to their goddess Astarte to ride (Fig. 5); and as she presided over the human process of procreation and birth, this tecalls the Asian role of the panther and also the leopard, in which they were re

lated to the idea of the birth of the world and of the appear
ance of life there.
The panther is also very frequently connected to the idea
of light, and his image often serves to support antique can
delabras (Fig. 6); similarly, on the other side of the world, the
panther’s close relative, the jaguar, appears in ancient Peruvian
jewelry as the sacred animal representing the blazing image of
the sun.
The ancient symbolism of the panther offered a striking
richness of allegory to Christian iconography. By dying and
bequeathing his skin to mankind, the ancients believed, the
129
129



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
panther obtained for human beings the gift of holy inspiration
and placed them under the sway of celestial influences; just as,
according to the mystics, the Savior through his teaching and
his death on the cross awakened man to his eternal destiny
and sent divine grace down upon him.
Several of the old writers had already attributed to the pan
ther the capacity to give out a scent of such exquisite sweet
ness that other animals—who, they said, were the only
creatures who could perceive it—were irresistibly drawn to it.
The Christian authors went even further: they added that
among all the animals, only the dragon and the snake, instead
of being amorously attracted by the panther’s scent, are on the
contrary so disturbed by it that they run far away at the first
whiff (Fig, 7).
Along with the Ancients, these Christian symbolists re
garded the panther, in company with the unicorn and the ele
phant, as one of the three animals considered to be chaste;
hence, the medieval artists harnessed them together to the al
legorical chariot of Virginity. This idea recurred up till the
eighteenth century, notably on a miniature of Renaissance
times which belongs to the Biblioth&que Nationale in Paris’.
In his twelfth-century Divine Bestiary, William of Normandy
added the following to his song about the panther’s beauty:
In this beast, without any doubt,
There is great and beautiful significance: And it signifies, without mistake, Jesus Christ our Savior Who by his great humility Took on our carnal nature®.

and the dragon who flees from it

THE PANTHER
The Armenian Bestiary from the Middle Ages also says that
the female panther sleeps for three days after she has eaten,
and then awakens. In the same way, Christ came back to life
after three days, having satiated his hunger—that is to say,
having achieved his earthly mission. When the panther wakes
up she roars with all her force, and from her mouth exhales an odorous breath which makes the other animals come flocking to this intoxicating
perfume. “In this same way, Christ, having tisen from the dead, made all men near and
far aware of a subtle and enticing odor?.”
As regards the panther and almost ev
erything else, the medieval heraldry of the nobility in our own Western countries coincided with the way of thinking of the bestiaries which had been the sources of herald
ry itself; but towards the end of the fif
teenth century, the primary meaning of her
aldic symbolism changed along with the
Christian understanding of it, and the sym
bol of the panther came to share the same
fate reserved till then for the tiger, and to
represent implacable ferocity, brutality, and Fig. 8 Heraldic panther
treachery (Fig. 8). One must recognize the from Connaissances nécessaires

tiaries, the panther and the leopard were who, isook if for’ grip.
often confused with the snow leopard and the tiger, and espe
cially, as we shall see, with the lynx. In fact, in the paintings
and sculptures of this period it is often very difficult to tell one of these carnivores from another, since the artists of the time had only an incomplete knowledge of them. Nearly all the animals which were symbols of Christ in sa
cred literature and art had also disagreeable characteristics
which in other circumstances made them representatives of
Satan or of human vices. Here we have the opposite sides of
some very beautiful coins. The harmful instincts of human na- 113311



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
ture which lead to evil were grouped by Christian asceticism
into three classes, which are the three concupiscences: con
cupiscence of the eyes, that of the flesh, and that of worldly
pride. The symbolists represented these three tendencies by
three animals: the panther, because its spotted coat seems to
be covered with eyes, the she-wolf, and the lion, since the for
mer was one of the ancient symbols of immodesty, and the
latter of pride. Dante uses this symbolism at the outset of his
sublime journey to the three habitations of the dead; the pan
ther is the first to stop him, and is soon joined by the she
wolf and the lion, and the poet is only saved from them by
the arrival of Virgil!®.
The symbolic antithesis of the panther in its chief role as
image of the Redeemer is the hyena, and in this presentation,
the symbolism of Christian times once again relied upon ele
ments from the ancient naturalists. The reference here is to
the common hyena of North Africa, the hyena crocuta, whose
spotted coat is somewhat similar to that of the panther. Pliny
specifically places these two animals in opposition to each
other. He recounts that in his time it was said that the hyena
was the terror of panthers, who would not even try to defend
themselves against it. A panther would never attack a man
wearing a hyena skin, and “it is an extraordinary thing that
when the skin of a hyena is held up in front of that of a pan
ther, the latter’s fur falls out!!.’”” His shadow alone strikes
dogs dumb.... The truth is that the hyena, although fero
cious, is also cowardly. :
The old naturalists endowed the hyena, like the panther,
with powers of fascination; but woe to those who listen to
him: “One hears of marvelous tales; the strangest is that the
hyena, roaming around the sheep-pens, imitates human lan
guage, and remembering a man’s name, calls him outside and
devours him!2.” But the most extraordinary fable, still accord
ing to Pliny, is that “hyenas are hermaphrodites; they become
alternately male and female, and can reproduce without the
male.” 132



THE PANTHER
Everyone, including Aristotle (who did not believe in the hermaphrodite story)!4, agrees in consigning to them the debased behavior of the slut and the scavenger after carrion that makes the hyena disgusting to all; and they also agree in attributing to it a knowledge of magical arts and of disquieting secrets belonging to the dead and to the invisible powers. Pliny says that this animal can also affect people’s minds, confusing them in order to attract them to itself. For later Christian symbolists, this notion of the hyena’s ability to disguise its voice became the perfect representation of that perfidious tempter, the Devil. Related to the panther are the cheetah, the leopard, the snow leopard, and the lynx, all middle-sized felines with spotted coats. The cheetah is the least fierce and was formerly

compared to Christ, the hunter of souls, because of the docility with which it allows itself to be trained like a hunting dog to pull down other fleet animals upon whom it leaps with remarkable speed and skill. Hunting with cheetahs still takes place in Turkestan and from the shores of the Caspian Sea to the Gobi Desert north of Persia and Afghanistan. Christian iconography sometimes represents the cheetah in the act of hunting. Dom Leclercq, notably, has reproduced an example found in a concordance of the Gospels from the tenth century!®, On it we see a hunter setting his cheetah in pursuit of a deer and his doe (Fig. 9). The cheetah can also be recognized in the spotted cat chasing a horned quadruped 138
133



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
in the arabesque decor of a pre-Islamic Coptic church, in an
other example given by the same Dom Leclercq. In the testi
monies of art, it is sometimes impossible to distinguish the
cheetah from the panther, leopard, or other wild cat; so it
should be emphasized here that unless a wild cat is portrayed
in the company of its master, the greatest caution must be ex
ercised in identifying it with the cheetah.
In regard to the leopard, Christian symbolism initially prop
agated an old misconception repeated by Pliny!’, which was
that the “leo-pardus,” lion-panther, was “engendered by a lion
and a panther, as the name seems to indicate!®.” Thus, the
animal was sometimes considered to be the emblematic repre
sentative of the fruit of illegitimate union. Another allegorical
aspect of the leopard’s character rests on the illusion which
led the Ancients to believe that the animal changes its skin to
deceive other animals as well as people. This led to the Chris
tians’ choice of the leopard as one of the principal images of
the infernal imposter, who with hypocrisy leads human souls
astray!®. By this symbolism the leopard is made the opposite
of the cheetah, which represents the Savior pursuing souls in
order to save them.
The leopard has earned a reputation for extreme ferocity,
and was one of the most feared of the beasts which tore to
pieces the Christian martyrs in the amphitheaters of Rome.
Records of the martyrdom of St. Marciana of Caesarea show
that she was torn apart by a leopard after a lion had spared
her?°.
The lynx was designated as “little panther,” in his treatise
on the hunt by the Greek author Oppien’', who lived in
Cilicia (southeast Asia Minor) during the third century A.D.
Along with Oppien, the other classical writers who related the
lynx with the panther consecrated it also to Dionysus?*, and
attributed most of the same qualities, whether real or fic
titious, to both animals. They even created new ones for the
lynx, which thus, like Jason’s Argonaut Lynceus, acquired the
privilege of such piercing eyesight that it could see everything 134



THE PANTHER
with perfect clarity even through the most opaque substances. Consequently, the lynx became the symbol of Christ’s omniscience, described by St. Paul: “Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight; but all things are naked and
opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do??.” Fi
nally, thanks to the power of vision accorded to him by the
Ancients, the lynx became known as Christ’s “Vigilance,” like the lion who sleeps with his eyes open, the falcon who was the
Egyptian eye of Horus, the crane who keeps watch holding a stone in his raised claw—the illumined vigilance of Christ who watches over his own, and whom nothing escapes
(Fig. 10).
The Ancients generously attributed to the lynx a keenness of hearing equal to the
imagined power of its eyes; it
Fig. 10 The lynx, from the Hortus Sanitatis.
was said to be extremely sensitive to beautiful music, which is why Virgil describes it
standing immobile and enraptured by the marvelous songs of Damon and Alphesiboeus?*. The old world’s imagination also endowed with extraordinary properties those conglomerates formed in the lynx’s body which they called lycurium; the principal virtue of this stone was said to be found in the treatment of mental disturbances, epilepsy, and jaundice. Marbode, Bishop of Rennes, who lived in the twelfth century, reported that the lynx could brush away the traces of its footprints with its tail, so that it could not be followed by people who wished to kill it and take the stone it carried within it?>. In mineralogy, a type of tourmaline is called “lynx’s stone” or “ligurite”: it is an aluminum silicate?°. Very ancient symbolism contrasted the lynx, which sees better than any other living creature, with the mole, who formerly was supposed to have no eyes and to die when exposed
to sunlight. Our good friend La Fontaine echoed antiquity’s 135
135



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
opposition of the mole to the lynx: “We are lynxes toward our
fellow men, and moles toward ourselves?’.””
Because of its life hidden in the earth, the Ancients some
times made the mole the symbol of the earth, as was the
snake in other circumstances; like the snake, the mole was
thought to know underground secrets. French peasants still
say that the mole always knows exactly what time it is, and
never pushes the earth from the mouth of its hole except at
noon and at six o’clock. The Greeks sacrificed it to Poseidon
because they believed the sea god was responsible for the sta
bility of everything built upon the earth; and the mole lives in
the upper level of the subsoil on which the foundations of all
buildings depend.
Fig. 11 The mole, from an 18th-century woodcut.
Christian symbolism made the mole the sign of the Demon,
the Prince of Darkness who plunges the eyes of the soul into
wilful obscurity and dwells at the bottom of the abyss, like the
mole in the shadows of its subterranean galleries (Fig. 11).
In popular superstitions, the mole plays a variety of roles.
In certain parts of the southwest of France, small children
wear little bags containing moles’ paws, to protect them from
convulsions; or the jaws of moles, to prevent intestinal worms,
since the moles devour the worms that enter their tunnels.

N THE ANCIENT traditions of the countries bordering the
Baltic and Norwegian Seas, the wolf was always considered
to be an animal of light, a sort of solar genie to whom the
constellation of the Great Bear was dedicated (Fig. 1). Besides
that, the folklore and the lore of the art of hunting of these
countries took over certain of the wolfs particular characteris
tics and habits to enrich their local symbolism!. However, this
does not prevent the Laplanders in modern times from re
garding the wolf as one of the Devil’s henchmen and from
blessing the bullets they aim at it.

THE WOLF
Phoebus Apollo, with the common European wolf, the Greek lukos. In the same Greek language, the light of dawn is called luke, the light that precedes full daylight. All the mythologists agree that the Greeks received the myth of Phoebus Apollo from the North. Every year, at the end of autumn, it was said, the divine Apollo would leave the temples of Greece and go far away to a mysterious northern country where reigned a perpetual spring and an unceasing light. He would return to Greece in the spring, at the moment when the sun seems to approach the earth. During these annual sojourns in the north country, Phoebus, the personification of the sun, necessarily encountered the two creatures dedicated to him there, the swan and the wolf. Here is a story that explains why the Greeks so often associated the god of light with the wolf, to the point of identifying them with one another: Apollo, they said, was the son of Zeus and Leto. “Zeus, his father, was the sky from which the light comes to us, and his mother, Leto, personified the night?.” The sun indeed is
born from the night at the hour of dawn‘, and in the shrines of Apollo it was further said that while his mother was pregnant with him, a wolf came to her, and because of this encounter, the vital essence of the solar wolf passed into him.
Consequently he received the surname Lukogenes, “born of the wolf’; and everywhere under the Hellenic sky the animal was associated with the cult of Phoebus Apollo. In Athens, the land surrounding the temple of Apollo, like the fleece of an animal surrounding its body, was called Lukeion, the “Lyceum” or school, meaning “the wolfs skin.” It was here that Aristotle taught philosophy. These and many other similarities between the Sun-god Apollo and the wolf later spread into the whole Mediterranean basin, and it was still remembered in the fifth century of the Christian era when Macrobius wrote that the Ancients represented the sun by the image of the wolf: “The Wolf who is the Sun,” he said, and added, “the proof that the sun was
given the name lukos, wolf, is that Lycopolis, the Theban city, 139

has similar cults of Apollo and the Wolf, in both of which the
sun is worshipped?.”
Apollo-Sun received the posthumous honor of being alle
gorically identified with Jesus Christ by the western Church of
the early centuries, as Dom Leclercq points out. In the fourth
century, “the gods gave way to personifications of morality, to
allegories. The Christians, by means of their interpretations of
the old symbols, gave them a new meaning and baptized some
of the most venerable pagan characters; for example, the Sun
god became Christ rising from the earth with the brilliance of
the sun®.”
The image of the wolf appears on certain coins made by
Gallic tribes”; it was also used as a motif in some unusual
statuettes found exclusively in Celtic countries. They show a
wolf holding a human being in his mouth,
“who seems,” as Salomon Reinach justly
states, “to be an attribute rather than a
prey® (Fig. 3).” He makes the very apt ad
dition that the disproportion in size between
the animal and the human subject indicates,
according to the customs of Celtic art, that
this is a divine wolf, a true Wolf-god?.
Could this enigmatic group have been in
Fig. 3 The man-eating wolf distant contact with the old Nordic tradi
of a ye tion which has it that the wolf, after having
es : participated in the birth of light, must at
the end of time devour the last days?
This union of the symbolic wolf and celestial light extended
even into the realm of inanimate things: because of the wolfs
glittering eyes which shine in the shadows of the underbrush,
the Greek lapidaries gave the name lycophtalmos, “wolf's eye”
to the most sparkling varieties of agate, as Pliny describes".
And the name Lycopodium, “wolfs-paw,” was given to a kind of
moss which when reduced to powder produced a very flamma
ble substance still used for fireworks and for theatrical plays
af licht and even in the symbolic rites of Masonic initiation. 140



THE WOLF
In certain regions bordering the Baltic Sea, the wolf is still believed to have a power and keenness of sight equal to that which is attributed to the lynx. In the same countries, it was also believed that when wolves come upon amber they stop and sniff it eagerly and for a long time, and in that way enter into contact with celestial forces from which they receive an extraordinary energy whose invisible effects are disseminated around them. The electric air of storms and the appearance of shooting stars and comets were said to affect the wolves and turn them into dangerous adversaries whose strength was increased tenfold by these phenomena, which awakened in them forces of other worlds. The moon’s influence also reached them and gave them strange gifts of insight, almost of divination. In the medieval traditions of the hunt in Europe, although the wolf’s symbolic relation to the light is not explicitly spoken of, its penetrating vision and intelligence are highly praised, as well as its stoicism in suffering and death. “Wolves,” said du Fouilleux later, “do not complain, as dogs do, when they are killed.” All these qualities are linked with the age-old ideas which for northern peoples associated the wolf with the light; and I think that it is in this relationship that one must look for the wolfs connection with the fauna symbolic of Christ. Nevertheless, for the first Christian symbolists of Rome the wolf had an evil reputation. Its depredations made it feared everywhere; although perhaps not more than the lion, the panther, and the lynx, also predators who feed on what they can find. But the wolf lacks the noble aspect of these animals, and the Latin symbolists, even before the Christian era, built on this fact to make the wolf represent all sorts of vices. In pagan Rome, the female wolf was the symbol for the worst kind of prostitute!2. Only one escaped the scorn of most of the early Christian writers, and that was the wolf in the Roman legend who suckled the glorious twins Romulus and Remus; the image of this animal symbolized the Empire, or more exactly the power of Rome (Fig. 4). Dante was in ac- 114411

cord with all his contemporaries in representing the “con
cupiscence of the flesh” as a female wolf!3, The wolf was also
made the symbol of other vices: of anger, gluttony, rapacity,
and heresy. The Savior himself, in
his parable of the Good Shepherd,
designated the wolf as the enemy of
his spiritual flock!*. And the evil side
of the wolfs character appears again

like that of so many symbolic animals, appears by turns in the
most luminous and divine aspects and, on the contrary, under
the dark shadow of Satan’s scepter.

THE BOAR,
The Bear, and the Hedgehog
N ALL THE ancient literature the wild boar appears as typical of ferocity, independence, and fearless brutality. In the Hellenic fables, the wild boar of Calydon, which was white and of divine origin, was felled only by the attack of Atalanta and Meleager; the boar of Erymanthus became the living prey of Heracles. In the Celtic countries, the wild boat’s reputation was even greater, and of a higher order!. The Celtic warriors, and later those of Gaul, adopted it as the military emblem of their fierce tribal independence, and as such it appears on the triumphal arch at Orange (Fig. 1). Even more: the Druids of Ireland and Gaul made the boar an image of intellectual and spiritual strength and supremacy, parallel with the material power and temporal might, both civil and military, which they symbolized by the bear. The presence of the wild boar on Gallic insignia indicates, therefore, that the temporal, military power of warriors bowed before the superiority and sovereignty of the spiritual, priestly authority of the Druids, whose leaders held the title of “Great White Wild Boars.” One finds again the symbolism
Leb

THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST

of the wild boar and the bear, with the same meaning, in the
legends of Merlin, the Celtic enchanter, and King Arthur.
René Guénon attributes the origin of this symbolism to the
far North, and he may very well be right*. He has them rep
resent the two polar and solar symbolisms, respectively?.
The image of the wild boar was very widespread in Gaul;
the statue of a Gallic Diana found in the Ardennes sits
astride a wild boar?. In the nineteenth century two golden
boars—probably tokens
— were discovered at Vendée in the
bank of a pond? (Fig. 2); Gallic coins bearing the animal’s
image are numerous, and on the Luccio coin discovered at
Poitou divine rays descend upon it® (see Title Figure).
Christianity was severe with the fiery animal which for the
Druids has been the emblem of spiritual strength and power.
However, during the first four centuries of our era, its image
is sometimes found on Christian lamps, where it seemed, ac
cording to Dom Leclercq, to symbolize the divine wrath. On
one of these it is placed in opposition to a dove, which like
the lamb represented Christ’s gentleness’.
Still, the wild boar was sometimes accepted as the image of
the just, independent, and courageous man opposing the ad
versaries of good and the enemies of his soul. In this sense,
St. Paulinus, Bishop of Nola, writing in the fifth century to
one of his correspondents, compared it with the lamb: “What
satisfaction would I not have to find you completely changed:
to see that the lion has now the meekness of a young calf;
that Tesus Christ inhabits the wild boar, who, conserving all 144



THE BOAR
his ferocity towards the world, has become a lamb in regard to God; you are no longer the wild boar of the forest, you have become the wild boar of the harvest.” But the Middle Ages recognized only the wild boar of David, who ravaged the Lord’s vineyard®. It was regarded as the “evil beast’? of the Apocalypse, the Antichrist. It was made the symbol of jealousy and brutality; its mate, the wild sow, was one of the symbols of lust, and in medieval illuminated manuscripts it served as the mount for the personification of anger®. What exactly was Diiret’s intention when he placed, near the creche where Mary laid down her child, a wild boar and a lion, instead of the traditional ox and donkey? Another animal that enters into Christian symbolism only from a negative aspect as a “ravager of the Lord’s vineyard” is the hedgehog. More in the imagination of the symbolists of long ago than by their real qualities or habits, the sheep and the hedgehog play opposite roles as representatives of Christ and of Satan. Medieval authors, relying on the authority of the ancient Greek and Roman naturalists and on the Physiologus, depict the hedgehog as a detestable creature, spiny and mischievous. When it gets into a fruitful vineyard, it chooses the finest vine, climbs it and shakes it until the ripe grapes have fallen on the ground. Then it impales them on its spines and goes off loaded with stolen fruit, to feed its young. Thus, according to Pierre le Picard, William of Normandy, and other thirteenth-century writers, the hedgehog made itself the image of the Evil One as the destroyer of souls and ravisher of spiritual fruits; and William of Normandy advised the Christian to take care lest this demon come to shake his vine or his fruit tree and to rob him of his fruit, that is, the fruit of good works!°. A miniature from a thirteenth-century bestiary, in the Bibliothéque Nationale in Paris, is a naive image of the devastating hedgehogs, already loaded with stolen fruit, shaking the vine or the berry bush (Fig. 3). 145
145



The characteristics of the hedgehog as the allegorical image
of Satan, and those of the sheep as the emblem of the Savior,
are consequently in complete opposition: the sheep is soft to
the touch, the hedgehog harsh and painful; the sheep, as the
Eucharistic symbol of its milk, gives of herself to nourish her
lambs, and the satanic hedgehog, to feed its young, steals the
welfare of others; the sheep is docile and quiet, and the
hedgehog on the contrary curls up into a bristling ball as
soon as anyone approaches it.

THE WEASEL
HE WEASEL IS the smallest European carnivore; it is also the most graceful and one of the most intelligent. It accustoms itself quite easily to man, and develops a singular attachment to the person who takes care of it. Buffon! and Mme. Delaistre? confirm this, and Christian hagiography agrees with these authors, informing us that the Dominican saint Jordan of Battberg had as his familiar a weasel that was his regular companion; in pictures of him, one always sees the tiny animal at his side or in his hand. Searching for symbolic images that would convey serious Christian lessons, the early glossarists pointed out that although the weasel is the smallest of the carnivores, yet it can win combats with much bigger animals than itself—so, they said, the weasel is the perfect symbol of a Christian who, no matter how weak in himself, can still triumph over Satan, the most terrifying monster of hell. Writers tof the last pre-Christian centuries imitated, apparently without understanding, an extremely ancient and enigmatic expression which seems to have been current in the whole of the ancient world: “The weasel conceives through the ear and gives birth through the mouth?.” Plutarch connected this assertion to humanity’s earliest times and the very origin of human language. Aristotle*, Ovid>, and other ancient naturalists recited the same dictum without understanding it at all, it would seem. This is yet another proof that in the last cen
turies before the birth of Christ the key had been lost to a 147

THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
host of symbols and enigmas relating to the most ancient
metaphysical concepts and religious mysteries.
“The weasel conceives through the ear and gives birth
through the mouth”; likewise, the disciple and also the initi
ate, listening to the word of the
master, receives through the ear
the seed of wisdom and of inner
———= light which impregnates his spirit;
eo SE then having thus learned much
through attentive listening, the
candidate for initiation becomes
in his turn a teacher, and through the wise and eloquent
speech of his mouth gives birth to disciples who are his spir
itual children.
The idea of choosing the weasel as the symbol of the per
fect disciple is certainly unexpected, and seems incongruous;
however, it is understandable if one takes into account that
“damoiselle weasel, of long and fluid body® (Fig. 1)” was for
merly, in some countries, one of the emblems of flexibility,
and that flexibility of the mind is the first quality necessary
for a disciple to become a perfect disciple. —Let whoever

THE WEASEL
habitual movement from one place to another explains why certain symbolists made the weasel their allegorical image of inconstancy, but others, looking further and higher, saw in it a symbol of carefulness, vigilance, and active paternal affection (Fig. 2). Given the old symbolists’ way of thinking, it did not take much to place the weasel among the fauna symbolic of Jesus Christ: this occurred at the moment when one of them, Brunetto Latini, took upon himself to write: “The weasel often transports its young from place to place so that — Fig. 3 The weasel and the basilisk;
from Cahier’ Bestiaires.
no one will find them, and if she
finds them dead, many people say that she resuscitates them, but how she does this they do not know’.” So in its own way, the weasel shares the symbolism of revivification with the lion and the pelican. : The Ancients were not unaware of the weasel’s services in destroying rats, mice, field mice, shrews, and other little ravagers. Phaedrus demonstrates this for us in his fables*. Pliny adds that the two European species of weasel wage a vicious war on snakes, and that their spleen is an effective remedy for the bites of venomous animals’. I have heard the peasants who live in the swampy countryside around Poitiers say that vipers never remain where weasels have made their holes. Pliny also tells us in two other passages of his great work that the weasel is the most implacable vanquisher (Fig. 3) of that terrifying reptile, the basilisk or cockatrice: “This monster,” he says, “as has often been proved for kings wishing to see its corpse, cannot withstand weasels, which lure it into a cave and kill it by the odor they exhale.” In another passage he says that the weasel itself will pursue the cockatrice into its lair, where everything nearby is burned by the reptile’s breath. Then, with nothing but its odor, the weasel kills it, and dies at the same time}. All the ancient Christian symbolists took 149
149



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
note of this duel in which the little animal triumphs over the
most dangerous of monsters, and kills it by means of its own
death. In the works of medieval writers and artists, the weasel
became the image of the Savior.
In Christian symbolism, rats and mice which spoil every
thing are among the emblems of the vices which corrupt the
soul!!, So the weasel, which hunts and destroys rats and mice,
was also adopted as the symbol of the one who purifies the
world by hunting down the vices that destroy whatever is
good. The weasel also sometimes symbolized a means of pu
tification; this is without doubt based on the old legend that
said that this animal’s scent is enough to purify its dwellings
from the presence of filthy reptiles, and also that with this
alone it slays the infernal cockatrice.
This idea is in accord with the old peasant superstition that
regarded wearing a weasel skin as an effective preventative of
poisoning from harmful vapors and infectious diseases. Pliny
also says that the weasel’s spleen is a very good remedy for
snake venom!2. According to Aristotle, weasels are careful to
feed on rue before fighting with snakes, because the reptiles
detest the odor of this plant!?. Rue was one of the plants of
the ancient pharmacopoeia used to cure people in the early
stages of leprosy, also mange and scurf!*; but all such skin
diseases were constantly taken in the symbolism of Christian
spirituality as symbols of sin. The idea of purification emerges
from all these diverse elements.
A slightly larger variety of the weasel is the ermine, which
changes color with the seasons: in summer it wears a tawny
coat with light grey underneath; in winter, it is entirely
clothed in snow-white, except for the tip of its tail, which is
black. This complete winter white belongs only to northern
weasels; in France the animal is greyish and not very
handsome?’.
Popular imagination of the past pictured the ermine as an
amphibious animal which only visited clear streams, meadows,
ar mossy. flowering woodlands. and which hated dirt to the
150



THE WEASEL
point that it would let itself be killed rather than tread on muddy ground and soil its immaculate coat. Seizing on this
fiction, medieval heraldry took the ermine as the symbolic im
age of a man determined to protect the purity of his
conscien—caen image that is, above all, that of the perfect
knight who prefers to undergo any misfortune rather than tar
nish his name and his escutcheon by the slightest act contrary to loyalty, fidelity, or knightly honor. It is in this sense particularly that many old and noble families, first and foremost of which were the ancient sovereign dukes of Brittany, adopted
or received the ermine as the insignia on their coats of arms (Fig. 4). The Breton dukes displayed it everywhere in their castles and cities with the proud motto: Potius mori quam foedari: “Better die than defile myself.”
Fig. 4 16th-century sculpture on the facade of the Chateau d’Azay le Rideau, near Tours.
Thus placed as the perfect sign of the soul’s purity, the ermine shares the symbol of the crucifixion with the swan, the dove, the lily, and the snow, embodying the innocence of Christ. Also, the ermine was one of the rare winter symbols
of the Resurrection, because, while brown in summer, it then seemed to disappear, only to reappear in all its whiteness with
the return of the snowy season. 115511

THE SNAKE
N THE GENERAL study of religious or philosophical symbolism of former times, the snake certainly presents the largest and most complex possible subject; however, at present
we shall have to limit ourselves to a brief and necessarily in
complete summary of the pre-Christian history of this symbol,
probably best known to us in the religious symbolism of Egypt. Primarily it represented the “Great God,” threefold and unique, whose power extends from heaven to earth (Fig.
1). A serpent-goddess healed diverse human ailments!; another was represented by a magic ring with a snake’s head?; and the goddess of the North, Wadjit, was also represented by a snake?. Of another order from the great and unique
God, the souls of those secondary gods, who were simply the

THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
deified souls of the ancestors, chose the bodies of snakes for
their terrestrial abode*: “The souls of all the gods reside in
the serpents,” says a text from the tomb of Seti I.
Many of the big Egyptian cities looked upon snakes as
their protectors. The sacred uraeus, the asp
Haje, was the protector of the pharaoh,
winding itself around his crown and defend
ing his forehead (Fig. 2).
The common practice in ancient magic of
accepting only two cold-blooded creatures,
the snake and the scarab beetle, as sacrificial
victims, seems surely to have originated in
Egypt’. Fig. 2. The double crown
of the pharaohs,
From the most ancient times the Africans i
encircled by the uraeus.
have dedicated many different cults to the
serpent. The Dinkas in central Africa believe that the spirits
of their deceased ancestors have been transformed into certain
snakes who are supernatural beings living in this world. The
same belief existed in a slightly different form in ancient
Egypt. The missionaries in Dahomey complain of the prepon
derant place given to snakes in the religions and fetichism of
the natives, and the reverential fear with which they honor
them: they prostrate themselves before the reptiles as if they
were intelligent and dangerous deities whom they dread rather
than love®.
The old religions of Assyria, Elam, Chaldea, Susa, and Me
dia and in our times those of India, China, and Japan all pre
sent us with the serpent either as a god or as a good or an
evil spirit. Both Brahmanism and Buddhism had and still have
their more or less divine snakes, beneficent or otherwise, such
as the one vanquished by Indra, whose victory was sung in
one of the hymns of the Rig-Veda’.
Greece also had its mysterious and celestial serpents: the
nearest to the divine was that of Zagreus-Dionysus; the most
infernal was the Python of Apollo. In the well-known legend,
Dionvsus. son of Demeter the Earth-Mother, also called
154



THE SNAKE
Zagreus, was cut up by the Titans into pieces of which one, the heart, was found by Athena. The heart then came back to life and gave birth to a new Zagreus®, who was symbolized by a horned serpent also called Zagreus. In the mystery ceremonies of Dionysus-Sabazius, a golden serpent—ordinarily a harmless grass snake—was put inside the top of the garment worn by the candidate for initiation; it was pulled out through the bottom of the robe? during a chanting of these enigmatic verses: “The Bull is the father of the Dragon, and the Dragon is the father of the Bull.” This was connected to high questions of the transformation of soul and spirit'® as was also the well-known formula, “A serpent never becomes a flying dragon until it has devoured another serpent.” The snake’s annual shedding of its skin was also the Ancients’ symbolic image for the ascending transformations of the human being; and certain Christian mystics referred to this symbolism in saying that, like the snake who sheds his unwanted husk, the believer must cast off the “old man” in order to begin a new life. The serpent, representing the spirit of good, of life, and of happiness, born like Zagreus from Demeter, the EarthMother, leaves her breast and climbs up the staff of Aesculapius, the god of medicine; it thus maintains the role of guardian deity, for it is a symbol of renewal and of the resto
ration of life. The Druids, who according to Strabo figured among the wisest men of the ancient world, concealed in the symbol of the serpent some of the highest concepts of their mysterious teaching. They apparently adopted the mode of thought of the rest of their world, which saw in the snake, born of the Earth-Mother from whom it comes forth renewed each springtime, the image of life. Coming from the earth, the snake was considered the knower of all its secrets, and this is why the oldest legends made it, like the dragon, the guardian of all sorts of hidden riches: the treasures of metals, of medi
cal cures, and of magic. Gallic statuary and iconography very 155

often show us the druidic serpent endowed with the horned
head of a ram. We find this representation on the Gallic altars
of Mavilly in the Céte d’Or!! and Montlugon!? (Fig. 3).
Gods holding the ram-headed snake in their hands have been
discovered at Montlugon, Epinal, the
Hétel-Dieu in Paris, Vignory, etc.
The relationship which the An
cients believed to exist between the
Celts, the Thracians, and the Illyr
ians would seemingly allow a correla

the Gallic Druids and Zagreus, the
horned serpent of the Orphic mysteries of Thrace and Greece!?.

traditions associated the serpent with
the flash of lightning snaking across the sky; and this is why
the reptile was also the symbol of fire in these same coun
tries!°, The art of these regions recognized two luminous ser
pents, one crowned with rays (Sol), and the other with a
crescent (Luna), the two torches of day and night; represented
together next to three stars, they formed the symbolic image
of five planets which in Chaldea, according to Diodorus
Siculus, were considered to be the five regents of the heavens
and governors of the worlds!°.
In Egypt, the asp Haje, the sacred uraeus of the pha
raohs, was one of the solar emblems; for the Greeks of heroic
times the rainbow was allegorically represented by three blue
serpents. From Homer we learn that this symbol appeared on
Agamemnon’s armor, alluding to the tainbow, the arch of Iris:
“and as a memorable sign to humans traced by Zeus in the
heavens!7.”

the Spirit of Evil. The oldest picture we have of this passage of the Bible is found engraved on a Babylonian cylinder that is now in the British Museum in London. On it we see a tree, a stylized palm bearing two clusters of fruit; on either side at
the foot of the tree are seated a man and a woman, their hands outstretched towards the forbidden fruit; behind the woman the Snake stands upright on its tail (Fig. 4). Basing his opinion on the evidence of some very important documents, Mr. Broussac of the Cairo Institute judges that the date of this cylinder is later than the account given by Moses, and is an echo of it translated in the Babylonian style!?. Early Christian artists frequently portrayed this biblical scene of the fall, and to characterize it they often transposed the snake’s head into a human face, sometimes the face of a young man smiling at Eve, Fig. 5 From the Hortus Sanitatis. 157

THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
as we may see in the Roman catacomb of St. Agnes; but even more
frequently the snake has the face of
a woman (Fig. 5). A large number
of artistic works from the early
Christian centuries in which the
temptation of Eden was represented
undoubtedly drew their inspiration
from even older picturings of Jason
and the sorceress Medea. As Dom
Leclercq says, the placement of the

In all the heterodox sects, as it was in pre-Christian antiq
uity, the serpent in its divine aspect is commonly represented
as ascending, either winding itself around the staff of
Aesculapius or that of his daughter Hygeia, or else around a
-tree trunk, as we see on certain Christian tombs from the
early centuries?!, When it is in a descending position itnearly
always represents the principle of evil, and for the Christians,

Satan. It is remarkable to find this
same symbol of the reptile and the tree in America, at Chichen Itza in Yucatan2? (Fig. 6), just as one also sees it in a Gallic-French sculpture, wound around the Tree of Life, this time in a definitely Christian con
text, between two altar or processional crosses?? (Fig. 7). A brief mention here of Voodoo, the Votan of the Antilles, a venerable grass snake that gave its name to a Black sect in Haiti, of whom a large number practice the Christian
religion. They nevertheless regard the snake Voodoo as a sort of
second-class divinity who holds his great and sacred power from Christ. The warm blood of victims sacri
ficed to the reptile is drunk by the adepts in secret ceremonies**. It is important not to forget the double aspect, good and evil, of the serpent in the symbolism of the
Church. “Even in Christian iconography,” wrote Guénon, “the serpent is sometimes a symbol of

Christ25.” This is indeed true, and a huge book could easily
be written on the religious and profane roles of the snake in
the Church’s first seven centuries. During the second part of
the Middle Ages, especially from the eleventh to the four
teenth centuries, the pastoral staffs or croziers of many
bishops and abbots ended ina spiral terminating in a serpent’s
head. Such is the case with the crozier of St. Hannon, pre
served at Siegbert?6; likewise, that of Gilles the Archbishop of
Tyre, preserved at Samur?’; that of a certain abbot of Air- 159
159



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
vault at Poitiers?8, and many others (Fig. 8). In each of these
cases, according to Canon Auber, the serpent almost always
represents the Savior, especially when it holds the cross be
tween its teeth, or carries the head of a lamb??.
In the Gospel, Jesus advised his followers to be “wise as
serpents, and harmless as doves*®.” Here, once again, Chris
tian symbolism goes hand in hand with older ideas which had
made the serpent the ideograph of wisdom. For the ancient
Egyptians, the snake represented divine wisdom. On several of
the more famous croziers we may also see a dove perched on
the serpent’s head or even taking refuge in its mouth (Fig. 9).
In its role as the seducer, the agent of evil and provoker of
sin in the story of Genesis, the serpent was the image of
Satan. In the French provinces, some of the country folk also
see the very image of the demon, or I might say an agent of
the demon, in the snakes which they say sometimes get into
the stables and stealthily milk the cows, goats, and ewes, and
thereby make them sterile.
The bestiaries of the Middle Ages ordinarily consign the
snake to the maleficent role of tempter under the name of
viper or asp. In the common language, “viper’s tongue” was
the expression which described that of slanderers, hypocrites,
traitors, and liars. Because the tip of certain snakes’ tongues
ends in a fork, the artists exaggerated the natural form and
made the point into a dart, an arrow, or a javelin. Like these
weapons, an evil word also strikes and wounds, and sometimes
kills.
In our own ancient tradition the serpent’s tongue had an
other, more benevolent role: in certain regions of Europe its
name was given to the fossil teeth of sharks which in other
places were called “wolf teeth.” These pseudo-snakes’ teeth,
mounted in a setting of precious metal, were supposed to re
veal the presence of poisons which might have been added to
food or drink, into which they were plunged in order to
“test” them; hence the name “testing stones” by which they
were sometimes known. 160



THE SNAKE
It would be interesting to rediscover the origin of this practice. While the snake’s venom always symbolized the works of Satan, we have seen, on the other hand, that this same snake was also one:of the emblems of Christ the Savior. The stone called “serpent’s tongue,” which revealed and unmasked the presence of poison and thus protected the user from death, could well have been, in the beginning of its history, not so far as one might think from the subject occupying us in this book. A frequently used symbol shows the snake bending its head, as if to drink, over an amphora or chalice (Fig. 10). It seems certain that when this image was conceived, the snake was regarded not as drawing life from the vessel, but as calling forth this life in itself. It must be remembered that for the Ancients the serpent was connected “above all to the very idea of life3!,” and that on the other hand, in the same time and place, the amphora was the hieratic and mysterious image of the pregnant woman, and the cup, that of femininity itself. Knowing only the first and more exoteric of these interpreta
tions, which seems to show the snake Fig. 10 Serpent drinking drinking in life and health, artists of mod- from the chalice; Loudun, ern times have linked the snake drinking pth century from the cup with medicine and medicinal illustrations. On the other hand, we will see later that the drinking vessel was and still remains one of the symbols consecrated to Christ; and this allows us to see, in the image of the serpent and the chalice, the earth, or its king, drawing vitality from Christ as the eternal principle and reservoir of life. This is the interpretation we may give it when we see it, as we still frequently may in Provence on the old stational crosses or those along the roadsides or at crossroads. In the Middle Ages, artist-initiates sometimes disguised the serpent in this symbol with the appearance of a capital G; we 116611

eyes rises the striking image of Death drinking from the divine vessel of life, from Christ, the kernel of survival, of the
eternal life which he promised: Ego sum resurrectio et vita: qui

HE FROG—HERE is another humble member of God’s
olstarake whose name many Westerners will be surprised to
see among those whom the reverence of the first Christian
centuries linked with the personal symbolism of the Lord
Jesus Christ. Nevertheless there are few whose Christlike sig
nificance is more explicitly attested in ancient art, and very
few indeed who can boast of so long a past history in the
symbolism of the human race in general. In the ancient world,
two varieties of frog found favor with the symbolists: the
green frog of the swamps (the rana esculenta of Linnaeus) is
the more familiar. It is essentially aquatic and hardly ever
comes out of the water except to warm itself in the sun. It is
this creature that in the lovely warm twilights of summer ut
ters the strange sounds that Aristophanes expressed for his
countrymen with the well-known onomatopeia “bre-ke-ke-kex,
koax, koax!!”” The other is the russet frog of the woods (rana
temporaria, according to Linnaeus), common in the woods and
copses of France, which does not enter the water except to
lay its eggs in February, and rarely returns to it. More myste
rious in its habits than its aquatic cousin, it was regarded as a
small omen of good fortune in the popular traditions of the
past; it shared the good will of simple folk with the European
tree-frog, the hila viridis, as it was said that both brought with
them a bit of good luck. As the russet frog rarely approaches
human beings, in many country areas it was considered a fa- 165
165



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
vorable omen to come across it, and it was not harmed. It is
to this frog in particular that the thinkers and mystics of ear
lier times gave symbolic meanings.
The prehistorians have discovered a number of times the
bones of the frog with those of the most ancient humans.
Usually there seems to be no recognizable significance in this,
but not always, since quite recently at Vieil-Auzay in Vendée,
a scientist, Dr. M. G. Guérin, found that the skeletons of a
necropolis dating from the Neolithic era, well before metal
was used in France, were buried with a frog’s foot in the
hand. And one finds again in this same region the same fu
nerary rite in burials two thousand years later?.
In Egypt, several thousand years before our era, the frog
was one of the symbols of the general fecundity of nature;
and the most serious zoological studies authorize this symbol
ism, as several times a year the frog lays some ten thousand
eggs at a time’. A text from the epoch of the Ramses pha
raohs shows the frog as the hieroglyph for the renewal of life,
and others connect it with the ideas of birth, of creation, and
of resurrection. As in several other very old symbols, the res
urrectional character is partly based on the fact that the frog
disappears during the winter season and returns with the re
newal of plant life. This may explain the presence of the alle
gorical frog in the hand of the Nile god, whose fertilizing
waters “renew the face of the land of Egypt.” It is this mean
ing that must be connected with the little stone or ceramic
frogs which were used as seals and were placed in the tombs.
These amulets express belief in the idea of resurrection and
of the renewal of life beyond death.
The Egyptian priests also used the frog to express divine
descent; this is proved by the presence of the frog in repro
ductions of scenes of the birth of pharaohs, who were sup
posed to be born of their mothers and the supreme god
‘Amon. It must have been intended to show reverence to the
royal figures in this parthenogenesis, this virgin birth which
was attributed to all the great mythic figures of the Mediter- 166



THE FROG AND THE TOAD
ranean region from about the seventh century before the
Christian era: Attis, Orpheus, Adonis, Dionysus, Tammuzand then to Buddha, all of whom were said to have been born of a virgin divinely impregnated. The Egyptian priests, whose knowledge was so astonishingly extensive, may have known
that the frog’s egg is capable of giving birth to a normal, liv
ing creature even if it is not fertilized by the male, on condi
tion that it is lightly pricked in the water by a fine, hard point
such as that of a thorn*. The work of our contemporary biol
ogists, notably Loeb and Bataillon, has incontestably demon
strated this fact, and who can say with certainty that the
learned ones of Egypt did not also know it?
The Egyptian idea of fecundity is also linked with the role
of Heget, the frog-headed goddess who holds the “key of life” in her hands and who is called in one text “she who causes to give birth®.”” Her function was perpetually to conceive and give birth to “the Egg of the World” which is perpetually being shaped and molded by the male god Khnum; she is thus the goddess of birth and of rebirth® (Fig. 1). Is it because the frog represents the goddess
Heget that in consequence it expresses the same idea that she does in the language of the hieroglyphs? According to Maspéro, it does not itself directly express the idea of resurrection, which is indeed the goddess Heget’s role’; but it does however imply this idea because of its reappearance in the spring after its wintet’s absence. He
get, with her frog’s head, can be seen at Deir-el-Bahri, in the
depiction of the union of the god Amon-Ra with queen Ahmes, the mother of Hatshepsut®. In the funerary treasure of princess Knumit, a lapis lazuli
frog was found next to the mummy; it had garnet eyes set in
gold®, and this detail immediately brings to mind the russet frog of our woodlands whose sclera, or outer rims of the eye

ball, are golden in color. Other frogs made of jasper, of lapis,
and of carnelian, also from Egyptian burials, make up a part
of the important Passalacqua collection!°. Also, Salomon Rei
nach has acquainted us with the frogs of Egypto-Grecian art
in bronze and agate in the museums of Berlin and the
Louvre!!, and still others coming from Cairo, Berne, Austria,
etc.!?
Chaldea, too, brought the frog into its symbolic bestiary,
but we do not know to what extent the idea it represents co
incides with that of the Egyptians; the Babylonian seal cylin
der which Delaporte brought to public notice, on which the
frog is depicted, does not give us the key to the mystery, as it
is difficult to identify clearly the personages appearing with it’. The little tree-frog of France, like the fabled frog of Ja
pan! is said to make itself invisible whenever it pleases, and
that notion comes from its real capacity to change color in
accordance with its surroundings, which often baffles its enemies!?. But who will tell us the exact meaning of the metal frogs in
the museum of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, which come from bur
ials in Colombia earlier by many centuries than Christopher
Columbus’ exploration in 1492? A tomb of the same date and
locality has revealed a frog cast in gold, thirteen centimeters
long and six centimeters high!®; its size and weight show it is
not a jewel, so it can only be a symbol, probably a talisman,
connected according to all appearances with the idea of rebirth or of fecundity even in death.
The Afticans of the Chari basin also revere stone or metal frogs which they use as amulets. It is interesting to underline here the equality of symbolic interest in the frog in the ancient and the new worlds, before the Christian era
(Fig: 2),
I have said before that nothing is Fig. 2 Pottery frog, from Deux-Stvres. 11668



THE FROG AND THE TOAD
more variable than the scale of dignity or sympathy that human beings have established for animals in different parts of the world; and we see that the first Christians in Egypt did not hesitate to use the frog as a sign of the Resurrection, and even to take it as an allegorical image of Christ. “We have dedicated a special study to the frog,” says Dom Leclercq!’, “and this ungraceful creature itself has been elevated to the dignity of a symbol of the Resurrection. From this example one might be tempted to think that there is no animal, even among the most repulsive, that does not have a special meaning for someone.” Thus the first Christian symbolists in Egypt found it natural to keep among their numerous symbols of resurrection the old one of Heget, the goddess of the renewing of the life principle, and to connect it with Christ himself. Edmond le Blant has suggested that “among the batrachians, the transformation of a rudimentary animal into a complete one might have offered an image of the Resurrection!’,” It is an indisputable fact that for the Ancients, the process: egg, caterpillar, chrysalis, then the butterfly; or egg, larva, chrysalis, then the bee or the dragonfly, were natural images of the successive transformations by which they believed human souls had to pass before they attained the } definitive state of blessedness. So one should not be surprised at the number of Christian lamps of baked clay coming from Luxor, from Edfu, Helicanus, old Cairo, etc., bearing the image of the symbolic frog. They can be seen in the Louvre, the British Museum, and the museums of Berlin, Leiden, and other places (Fig. 3). The two lamps of the ancient Cabinet de France and the one in the museum of Turin are especially revealing. One of those in the Louvre, and another in the Turin museum, show the frog with the cross on its back, and the inscription ego eimi anastasis: “I am the resurrection” (Fig. 3).

THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
The Gospel tells us Christ thus designated himself".
There are many other Christian lamps bearing the image of
the frog, and all these are from before the sixth century.
Three centuries earlier, the Gnostics admitted the frog among
their symbolic animals, and it can be seen on the leaf of a
lead booklet where it represents the renewing principle beside
a serpent symbol of the Agathodaimon, the divine spirit of
good?9; or perhaps the image of death confronting that of the
principle of revivification? On a carved stone of Gnostic ori
gin, also, the frog appears between the fish, which is certainly
the emblem of Christ, and Glycon, the lionheaded serpent (Fig. 4).
Although the Egyptians’ reverence for the
frog is evidenced by all the symbolic charac
teristics they conferred upon it, the He
Fig. 4 Gnostic intaglio brews, on the contrary, placed it among the
Si eae unclean beasts; indeed, it was the instrument
of the second plague which the Lord visited upon the Egyp
tians in Moses’ day?! And this repulsion felt by the Hebrews
seemed to be reflected in the book of Revelation, where we
read: “I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the
mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and
out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits
of devils, working miracles?”.”. And this was echoed in the
Clavis attributed to the pseudo St. Melito (which seems in
fact to be of the eighth century), with the pitiless and unjust
verdict: “The frog is the demon.” Msgr. Barbier de Montault
is right in saying that here the symbolic meaning of the toad
has been mistaken for that of the frog??. Because of the sim
ilarity of shape of the toad and the frog, the former was long
ago taken, at least indirectly, as the antithesis of the latter.
Although the frog does not necessarily inspire disgust, the
toad on the contrary is everywhere the object of general re
vulsion, as much because of its pitiable gait as it drags itself
along as on account of its warty skin, which exudes at times a
disgusting, poisonous slime. This unfortunate aspect has made
170



THE FROG AND THE TOAD
people so unjust to the poor creature as to forget that it is
one of their most useful friends and co-workers in the garden, where it feeds on nocturnal worms?*. In Christian symbolism, the toad has been used to represent the sin of lust in its filthiest aspects. In the Middle Ages, sculptors, painters, and engravers show it along with the serpent and lizards devouring the sexual organs of naked sinners, or suckling greedily. at breasts swollen with lust; we see this in many Romanesque churches, for example at Montmorillon in Vienne, Saint Cernin of Toulouse, at Saint-Jouin-de-Marnes in Deux Sévres, at Sainte-Croix of Bordeaux, at Moissac and in many other places?>. One of hell’s punishments for the sin of greed was represented as the toad being eaten by the damned. In addition, in the symbolism of the vices, the toad was the emblem of jealousy, which explains why Edmond Rostand, in his Chantecler, made it the image of the basest envy. But the usual role of the toad is to represent the Devil (Fig. 5): on the twelfthcentury portal of the church of Saint-Léger de Montbrillais, in Vienne, the toad emerges from the mouth of one possessed by a demon which a priest is exorcizing. At Foussais, in Vendée, on one of the roof vaults of the portal, also of the

THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
twelfth century, the toad is placed next to the mermaid, an
other symbol of the demon of lust (Fig. 6).
This symbolic connection of the toad with the Evil Spirit
was formerly made throughout the whole ancient world; even
today, in Annam, the buffalo-toad, which in the eerie twilight
gives out a sinister sort of bark, is supposed sometimes to be
the embodiment of Macui, the Spirit of Evil. In Europe, dried
and made into a powder which was dispensed by the pharma
cists of times past, it has always been part of the equipment
of rustic witchcraft and of that debased sorcery which still
makes use of evil philters, such as that containing the pus
scraped from the toad’s back, of which a greater quantity is
obtained by rubbing the animal with salt.
The poor toad is useful in the general economy of creation
and deserves better treatment from humans whom it helps, in
its own way, quite as much as do the swallow and the wood
cock. But I know of only one case in which the credulity of
earlier days has endowed the toad with a beneficent aspect,
Fig. 7 Extracting the toadstone, from the Hortus Sanitatis. 172



THE FROG AND THE TOAD
and this only by means of an illusion which often brought about its death. The Middle Ages inherited from previous centuries the belief that there might sometimes exist in the head of very old toads a marvelous stone, which developed after the creature’s death. In France, these stones of imaginary origin were called crapaudines, toadstones, and they played an important role in traditional customs up to the very threshold of our present times. They were still sold for a good price in 1634, as bezoars, or poison antidotes?®. The Greeks called this fabulous stone batrachites, and the Latins, bora (Fig. 7). Superstitions are generally the distorted reflections of religious ideas, or of symbols whose meanings have deviated in the course of too prolonged a pilgrimage on time’s road; who can tell us what thought was at the origin of that strange, mistaken belief of past centuries in the toadstone, although the toad itself was an object of general repulsion? Is it simply the result of human stupidity? Like the ocean pearl, the toadstone was supposed to discover any poison that had found its treacherous way into the wine, and to annul its mortal effects—a faculty which reminded our forefathers, imbued as they were with the Christian beliefs, of the one who said of his disciples: “They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them?7.”

THE SALAMANDER
ALAMANDERS ARE AMPHIBIOUS, lizard-like reptiles of many colors—red, black, light yellow, orange, and violetand in spite of having a bad reputation, they are inoffensive creatures, and useful because they destroy a considerable quantity of harmful insects and their larvae. There are several species of salamander, some of which, Cuvier tells us, reach an enormous size. The kind which interested the symbologists is the spotted salamander which is common in Europe and which is about twenty centimeters long. Its body is covered with small, bulbous protuberances which, when the creature is in pain or danger, secrete an abundant yellowish-white mucous substance; if the animal were placed on live coals, this could postpone for a brief moment its being burned up, but certainly is not a guarantee of that immunity to fire which at the end of the thirteenth century the salamander was still believed to have, in spite of the contrary opinion of Albertus Magnus. There are few animals upon whom the Greek and Roman naturalists have lavished more fantasies and fictions than the salamander. Pliny relates in all seriousness that “it is so cold that it puts out fire by its touch, as ice does.” He adds that its spittle “would make all the hair drop off the body of any human being it touches!.’”’ Aristotle and especially Aelian? also exaggerated the salamander’s marvelous properties; and after them, the authors of the bestiaries and other medieval works on symbolism stated that the harmless beast fatally poisoned the water of the wells and fountains that it entered, and
175

that it even spoiled the fruit of the trees it climbed?; others added that its presence alone was enough to change the character of liquids in food and drink, that it was itself neither male nor female*, or was both at once, etc. Brunetto Latini affirmed that not only can fire do it no damage but that its
very nature extinguishes fire®. In addition, the Middle Ages attributed to the salamander the power of working with different materials in the middle of burning braziers and thereby transmitting unique qualities of incomparable efficacy to what was worked on. Thus we read in Eschenbach’s Parzival: “This tunic had been made in the midst of flames by ingenious serpents called salamanders... .°” The “tunic” spoken of here is a coat of mail or of steel plates. In the sixteenth century, the grave and frequently ingenuous Ambroise Paré, however, had lost faith in the salamander’s invulnerability, and expressed the matter thus: “Mattioli says that the salamander, thrown into the midst of a great fire, is suddenly consumed; it is a great folly to hold to the belief that fire cannot consume it and that it can live on fire as the
Fig. 1 Fire personified holding chameleon lives on air’.” the salamander, in the Saint- But relying on ancient fictions, our Omer Maseun forefathers often made the salamander the emblem of fire, and of “the spirit of fire.” Fire personified on the base of a twelfth-century cross, in the museum at SaintOmer, holds the symbolic reptile in his hand® (Fig. 1). The alchemists made it the sign of the work of calcination (Fig. 2), and this, according to the neo-occultists, would be what it represents esoterically, under the exoteric aspect of Justice, on the portal of Judgment in the cathedral of Paris (Fig. 3). Cloguet says of the medieval identification of the salamander with fire, that “It is the king of this element and as a consequence of this royalty, the image of Jesus Christ®.” 176



THE SALAMANDER
Fig. 2. The salamander curled like the ouroboros, from a Greek alchemical manuscript in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris.
The salamander also represented impartiality: because the ancient legends say that it could live in the midst of flames by “maintaining the good fire and extinguishing the evil.” This is what Francois I made his symbolic salamander express, by surrounding it with the legend: Nutrisco et exstinguo: “I nourish and I extinguish—”I nourish the good fire and extinguish the evil!® (Fig. 4).
Thus the judge must be impartial and sustain the innocent and punish the guilty with perfect integrity. Chastity and virginity also claim the salamander as emblem because they pass through the midst of the passions flaming around them without being burned. A

burning seductions of this world, and by the same token, the Savior, and also his mother whom the Church calls the Im
maculate. Like the salamander in the flames, the Mother and
Son pass through the sinful human realm without acquiring
the slightest shadow of stain. Thus the salamander is seen in
the ornamentation of cathedrals as an attribute of these vir
tues; and if in certain cases the condition of the carvings is
such as to make it unsure whether it is the salamander or the
phoenix that is represented, much more probably it is the salamander that should be recognized!!. With the same idea of miraculous resistance to fire, Wil
liam of Normandy makes the salamander the image of the
three young Hebrews who emerged unhurt from the fiery fur
nace of Babylon!?. Mystical conceptualization at the end of
the Middle Ages, basing itself on all these stories and on the
uses to which they had been put by the writers of the tenth to
the fourteenth centuries, naturally applied certain aspects of
this symbolism to Christ. Msgr. Barbier de Montault suggests
that the fire represented by the salamander is one of the attributes of the Savior, who said: “I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled!??” We
have already heard the statement of the iconographer Cloquet,
that the Middle Ages made the salamander the image of
178



THE SALAMANDER
Christ because of his kingship over fire. As the three young Hebrews emerged alive and joyful from the Babylonian furnace, Christ also after descending into the fires of hell came . through them victoriously. Here the salamander is joined with the hydra of the Nile in the symbolic representation of the descent into hell of the Apostle’s Creed. Isaiah also had prophesied in terms which the medieval symbolists adopted!*: Si transieris per ignem, non combureris, flamma non exuret te: “When thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee!?.” The science of heraldry, often a very faithful echo of the themes of the symbolists, maintained the salamander’s character as emblem of purity and integrity in every aspect. Heraldtry also made it express “constancy in adversity,” because it endures the fire where no other living creature can dwell with impunity. The salamander of chivalry manifested the power to keep beyond the reach of all evildoing, injustice, dishonesty, cowardice, or anything else that might besmirch an escutcheon.

THE CROCODILE
HE TWELFTH- AND thirteenth-century artists who illus
"T tieeed the not very well documented tales of their con
temporaries represented the symbolic crocodile more as a
heavy pachyderm than as a big lizard several meters long. The bestiaries called it “cocodrille”’ and even “cockatrice’’; this
last name, as we have said, is still given in certain parts of
France to the egg from which the basilisk is supposed to
hatch. In ancient Egypt, the crocodile was the terror of those
who lived along the banks of the Nile, and magical spells
were recited for protection from it. Plutarch informs us that it
was the symbol of Typhon-Set and his son Maka, who person
ified evil!, which explains why the monuments show the crocodile beneath the feet of Horus. However, some tribes honored
it as a god, under the name Sebek— doubtless a carry-over
from a totemic or heraldic role that it had played among their
remote ancestors? (Fig. 1). The cult of the crocodile still ex
ists today here and there in the Sudan and southern Nigeria,
especially at Ibadan, Nigetia’s chief city, where in a little lake in the center of the town dwells an enormous saurian, revered
by the inhabitants, which is said to have lived there for a hundred and fifty years.
Christian symbolism never showed any sympathy for this

THE CROCODILE
evilly disposed creature, and made it the personification of hell itself, doubtless because of the immense size of its gullet which engulfs the small animals and fish on which it feeds. The artists in stained glass, the illuminators, and the first wood-engravers before the Renaissance often depicted the entrance to hell as the gaping maw of a dragonlike monster in which the demons roasted the condemned souls; and the dragon is nothing else but the crocodile endowed with wings. In opposition to the crocodile, Christian symbolism placed a very dangerous enemy: the hydra of the Nile, which it made one of the symbols of Christ, the conqueror of hell. Now, ever since the Greeks created the fable in which Hercules vanquished the hydra of Lerna, a horrible reptile whose seven heads grew back as fast as they were cut off, the mere name of this monster was enough to terrify and repel, and the hydra joined the company of the accursed beasts of the day. How could the early symbolists make of this creature, under this very name, a symbol of the Redeemer? The only possible answer is in the astonishing stories told by the old Greek and Roman naturalists about the crocodile, of which they seemed to know very little. The Bestiary of Pierre le Picard describes the Nile hydra as a long, slender reptile, or rather as a sort of small, waterdwelling dragon. It is possible that after all, the Nile hydra’s prototype was the varan, a big lizard which lives on riverbanks in Africa, from the French Sudan to the banks of the Nile’, but who in reality has to let the powerful crocodiles alone. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the varan is considered a sacred animal from the borders of Egyptian Nubia to the Saharan region of Timbuktu. Benhazera says that the Touareg had and still have a cult dedicated to the varan, which the Arabs call ouran and the Touareg, ar’uta. The animal is never killed or eaten by the nobility among these
people. “The varan, which has been known since the earliest antiquity, was depicted on Egyptian monuments. Herodotus called 118811



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
it ‘the terrestrial crocodile,’ although it is more closely related to the lizard than to the crocodile... .*” In any case, here is what William of Normandy, writing at
the end of the twelfth century in the language of an older day,
tells us about the hydra: “The hydra is a very wise animal
and knows well how to do harm to the cockatrice. The cock
atrice is this proud beast who lives in the river Nile. It is
twenty cubits long, it has four feet armed with claws, and
sharp and pointed teeth. If it meets a man, it kills him, but
then remains inconsolable the rest of its life>. The hydra who
has mortal hatred for the cockatrice sees it asleep in the sun
with jaws agape®, it rolls in the mud and when it is well
coated with slime, heads straight into the cockatrice’s mouth,
enters its belly, tears out its entrails and emerges by piercing
its enemy’s flank. The latter dies, for there is no cure for such
wounds’.” Here we hear again a legend told of the mongoose smearing itself with clay to attack the asp—a
fable which both Aristotle and nl ET. LA COLDDRILLE Pliny have included in their celebrated works®. Pierre le Picard tells the story a little differently: he says that when the cocodrille sees the
hydra, it launches itself at its enemy and swallows it alive; but
the hydra then tears out the huge creature’s entrails and
breaks out through its belly, wounding it mortally? (Fig. 2).
Neither William of Normandy nor Pierre le Picard trou
bled themselves, any more than did the ancient author of the
Physiologus, to find out whether their accounts were true or
fantastic. The only thing that was important to them was to
find an image of Christ’s triumph over hell and death, so as to
have a symbol to which St. Paul’s saying could be applied:
“Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy
sting!°?” William of Normandy concludes thus!!:
“The cockatrice signifies death and hell, do not doubt my

word; thus, as the hydra kills it, so did our Lord Jesus Christ who covered his divinity with human flesh (as the hydra covers itself with clay), entered hell to deliver his friends, and could say with the prophet: ‘O grave, I will be thy destruction'?.” Pierre le Picard, for his part, says much the same. This then was the symbolism of the relation of the hydra with Christ, the theory of which was well established at the time of the Capetian kings. In the realm of iconography, the decoration of the altar of Narbonne which is in the Louvre, and is attributed to the hand of the fourteenth-century Jehan d’Orléans, depicts Jesus with the cross in his hand, standing in the opening of the enormous, flaming maw of a saurian—the cocodrille of the bestiaries—and out of it drawing forth Adam, the first of the righteous ones!?. An illumination taken from a thirteenthcentury manuscript gives an even better image of Christ, who seems to come forth like the hydra from the flank of a winged crocodile!+ (Fig. 3). The victorious battle of the hydra against the crocodile is thus the illustration of the Descent into Hell spoken of in the Apostle’s Creed, which in the Middle Ages was so often interpreted by more theatrical and more compli
cated compositions!>. 183

THE VULTURE
HE LAMMERGEIER, OR sheep vulture, is the largest bird of prey in the Old World; its wingspread at full extent reaches nearly three meters. This bird is found especially in the countries bordering the eastern Mediterranean and the Black and Caspian Seas, in the Caucasus, the Ural mountains, and western Asia from India as far as Siberia. It has the nature of both the eagle and the vulture, but its formidable beak is larger and harder than that of either. The lammergeier was the sacred bird of the Scythians, who inhabited the southeastern part of Russian Europe; perhaps it is this bird that is so often represented on Syrian tombs in Roman times, instead of the eagle as has generally been supposed. At the beginning of our era, the Goths, who occupied southern Scythia, adopted the lammergeier as one of their national emblems and placed it in the front rank of their symbolic fauna. We know nothing about the meanings attached to the huge raptor by these two barbarian races, but we can well imagine that among other things, they saw in it the symbol at least of strength, if not courage, since the lammergeier’s attack is terribly fiery and powerful. In any case, in their migrations toward the west through the valleys of the Danube, the Adige, and the Po, and through northern Italy, the Goths left behind examples of the crude but brilliant and extraordinarily stylized art of their goldsmiths, which the Franks adopted after the collapse of the
Roman empire. Thus the image of the lammergeier (doubtless 189

THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
often confused by the Romans and the Gallo-Franks with that of the eagle) was spread through the West mostly in the forms of clasps, buckles, and other ornaments; and it is the lammergeier again that must be recognized in the bird which some people still call “parrot” because of the exaggeratedly hooked beak that the Gothic artisans gave it as if with the intention of marking the difference between it and the falcon or the kestrel. We can recognize Christian handiwork in several of these birdshaped ornaments (Fig. 1). It seems certain that after their conversion to Christianity, the Goths transferred to their national bird all or part of the symbolic connotations that Western Christian symbolism then attached to the eagle!. ‘ Other members of the vulture family occupied

THE VULTURE
was transferred to the pelican, which according to the ancient symbolists and the authors of the bestiaries brings its chicks back to life, not by feeding them with its blood, but by pouring it over them. When we come to consider the symbolic
pelican, we will see that the reason it became a Eucharistic
emblem was because of the transference made to it of the
fable, which in ancient times belonged only to the vulture, of nourishing its starving children with its own blood. Throughout the Near East, the vulture was recognized as a
beneficent purifier, fulfilling the same role as the ibis which in
this aspect was undoubtedly one of the emblems of Christ. In
the parts of western Asia where the bodies of the dead were
exposed to the elements and to the birds of the heavens, the
vulture was formerly venerated as the active agent in deliver
ing them from their decayed flesh—and doubtless it still per
forms the same office there in the solitude of the funeral “towers of silence.”
In ancient Europe, the Greek and Roman naturalists,
echoed by Pliny, represented the vulture as being one of the
most powerful enemies of dangerous snakes. “The mere odor
of its feathers,” he tells us, “chases the reptiles away, and whoever carries with him a vulture’s heart is safe from their attacks and from those of all venomous creatures?.” The An
cients also believed that the vulture’s head contained another powerful talisman, the quadratus stone which brings perpetual
felicity. A learned friend of mine is convinced that it was on account of these things and in general of its honorable reputation from the past that the first Christian sects—Theban,
Lil

THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
Coptic, Ethiopian, and those from the valleys of the Euphrates and the Caspian regions —were persuaded to bring the pharaonic vulture into their religious symbolism, if only on the basis of popular folklore. This is quite possibly the case, for
in all these places, especially North Africa from the Red Sea to Morocco, the vulture has always aroused lively sympathy. Every year the neighborhood of Constantine, in Algeria, celebrates the “Feast of the Vultures.” A banquet of choice meats is placed at the threshold of the venerated Marabout Sidi M’eids’ tomb, from which the sated vultures arise and fly away in the evening, carrying toward the saint the prayers and petitions of his followers®. It is true that the Christian East in its early centuries sometimes saw in the vulture an allegorical image of the purifier of the world and the vanquisher of the infernal serpent,
as it did in the ibis and the stork whose habits are as disgust
ing as the vulture’s own; however, our Western symbolism credited the bird with only one of its supposed virtues: the highly illusory one of the quadratus stone mentioned by Pliny. About 1490, Joannes de Cuba reminded his contemporaries that the quadratus, quadros, or quarridos stone is “sometimes found in the vulture’s head.” And after extolling the rare virtues of this miraculous talisman, he shows a man breaking the head of a submissive vulture to get possession of the precious
stone” (Fig. 4). Religious thought has drawn the following moral from this fantasy: just as the person who wishes to possess the stone of happiness has to break the vulture’s skull, it is necessary to break “the head” of our vices, represented by the vulturethat is, our inclination toward our “besetting sin” —in order to find rest for the conscience and quietness for the soul, which provide the first and indispensable condition for happiness. Aside from this, our medieval symbolists made the vulture the sign of the demon of gluttony, on account of the rotting 192

flesh and filthy creatures that this bird avidly devours®. For others, the mythological vulture, which ceaselessly tears the continually renewed liver of Prometheus chained to his tock, is Satan plundering the soul chained to its vice. “It represents human sin,” says Godard?, and its constant punishment in a life that is forever renewed. The heraldry of the nobility made the powerful but cowatdly vulture, which sometimes when overfed lets itself be killed with a stick, the antithesis of the royal and noble eagle which is always alert and valiant. It was the emblem of cowardice and of low habits, to be scorned by all high-minded people.

THE FALCON
HE DIURNAL BIRDS of prey trained to serve man in hunting were divided in European falconry into two groups, called by some “noble” and “ignoble”!. The former included the gyrfalcon, the peregrine, the lanner and saker falcons, the kestrel, the merlin, and the hobby. Among the second were the goshawk, the kite, and the sparrow hawk. Of all these, the ancient cults, arts, and literature seem to have retained for symbolic purposes almost exclusively several of the falcons, including the kestrel, the hobby, and the sparrow hawk (Fig. 1). These birds, even when captured as adults, become relatively tame; while I write these lines, one of them, cured long since of a gunshot wound, sits motionless and free within reach of my hand, and allows itself to be stroked, which is the extreme limit of condescen

particular attachment to the kestrel, because it defends them against the sparrow hawk which flees at the sight of it or at the sound of its voice.” He distinguishes here between two species of raptor although most ancient authors grouped all the small birds of prey indifferently under the name of falcon or kestrel?.

the falcon, and the one written by the emperor Frederick II, in the thirteenth century, which Albertus Magnus included in his own works?, is not the least curious of these. In order to speak of the falcon as they did, and to represent it in painting and sculpture in postures so characteristic that they imply a deep knowledge and keen observation of its habits, the ancient Egyptians must have lived habitually in the company of this bird, whether in the falcon house or in the hunt itself, for the art of falconry is extremely old. A protohistoric artwork from Armenia, dating from the Iron Age, shows a hunting falcon, leashed* (Fig. 2), and Pliny speaks of falcons and kestrels trained for the hunt. As early as the first dynasty, thirtyfive hundred years before Christ, the pharaoh Djer, successor of the great Fig.2 Prehistoric Armenian Menes, took the title of Falcon-King. art showing the leashed falcon. THe noble bird was already what it has always been, the protector of the royal person, and at the same time one of the most revered images of the Divinity. A little later, at the time of the great empire of Memphis, the formidable Chephren, builder of the highest of the pyramids, established a cult for the falcon which he proclaimed everywhere and which his successors and their subjects maintained until the disappearance of the Egyptian religion. As we have already seen, in the religious concepts if ace cient Egypt, the splendid image of God was the triple aspect of the Sun: the actual sun, incarnated on earth in the pharaoh; and Ptah, who represents above all the divine fatherhood, and is the architect and protector of all things. A second trinity appears, as we said in speaking of Man in the Tetramorph?, in Ptah himself, the father god and king of all, Horus, the heart of divinity, its intelligence and goodness, and Thoth, the Word. Certainly this is an oversimplification of the complex theogony of the Egyptian religion, for the purpose of 196



THE FALCON
defining the meaning of Horus, the heart of God, who was from the beginning represented by the symbol of the falcon: Horus, whose nature gives the Egyptian religion the special character, universally recognized today®, which sets it apart from other ancient religions, as one of benevolence and of generosity. All the Baals and the gods of Chaldea, Babylonia, and the other great nations were terrifying gods, and for the Hebrews, Jehovah was presented above all in the aspect of a severe master demanding justice. Very special qualities have brought the falcon, especially the one that in England is called the hobby, the honor of incarnating the great and moving myth of the god Horus in Egyptian sacred art. One of these is that in spite of the fierce pride that characterizes the bird, it approaches more closely the dwellings of human beings than the other raptors, and even deigns to share a house with them if it is built high enough. The priests saw that while the other birds of prey sought out lonely cliffs and forests, these falcons alit and made their nests in the summits of palaces and temples; and they said that Horus also, the heart and essence of the loving-kindness of the divine Being, bends down Fig. 3 The falcon,

the Christian era, this symbolism was in general use and the falcon was shown everywhere. Crowned with the double tiara of the pharaohs, it stands on the royal banner of Chephren above the hieroglyphic inscription: Heru ousir haiti, “Horus whose power is his heart.” The Egyptian hieroglyph for heart is the vase (Fig. 3). And when the same powerful monarch Chephren ordered the impressive statue which represents him today in the Cairo museum to be carved in very hard stone, the artist represented the bird of Horus, the falcon god, covering the pharaoh’s nape with his body. A number 197

of Egyptologists explain this as the sign of Horus’ protection of the royal person; this is certainly true, but I believe there is another meaning also, which has been spoken of earlier’. The divine falcon is shown here in the act of fecundating the thought of the pharaoh, who is the earthly agent of the divinity (Fig. 4). The divine nature is thus infused into him and animates his intelligence.

Inscriptions on monuments confirm this theory, and their texts have allowed Egyptologists to write of the pharaoh: “The king is Horus by right, direct successor to the falconheaded god; king, god, standard of excellence, he is the master of all humanity among whom he acts according to his will with the infallibility that is his birthright!°.” This same symbol of the falcon placed on the pharaoh’s nape is found again, according to Rougemont, in the hieratic iconography of the kings of Assyria!!. Probably this came through the contact of their realm with neighboring Syrian possessions in Egypt. Like all the great gods of Egypt, Horus is the personification of one aspect of the one and only God: he is the prolific father, and his images often show him holding the Key of Life (Fig. 5), or crowned with the lotus, the flower of life!?. In Egyptian iconography, the falcon represents not only the god Horus but also the god Ra, and even Khonsu, the son of Amon and the goddess Mut, whom the Thebans, in particular, also depicted with a falcon’s head. When this bird stands for Horus, it wears on its head the double crown of the pharaohs

(Fig. 6), and when it stands for Ra, its head carries a disk formed by the uraeus curved into a circle (Fig. 7). And the god Ra, in the aspect of the Falcon, is saluted thus on a pottery fragment found in Cairo:
Thou awakest in beauty, magnificent Falcon of the morning, Who openest the eyes... Carrier of light, destroyer of darkness, Glorious, multicolored, Who createst the light with thy divine eyes; The earth is blind when thou goest.
Magnificent Sun, radiating brilliance,
Great Falcon with speckled plumage Thou that traversest the skies with thy swift flight, Splendid light of dazzling whiteness .. .
It is probable that the falcons often found in the minor statuary of ancient times are also connected with sun-worship, and in Assyria as in Egypt, the falcon was the protector of the country’s rulers. In spite of the falcon’s violent habits, the relation which the Egyptians found between it and the heart of God and of humanity connected it with the symbolism of love. This idea,

though rarely expressed, nevertheless persisted through the centuries, at least to medieval times; for the Tuscan poet Francisco da Barberino (1264-1348) described love as having the feet of the falcon!3. One of the most alert and watchful of the raptors, the very essence of this bird’s character seems to be an anxiety that imposes a constant, vigilant attention; and for that reason, the vigilance of Horus, the loving heart of Divinity, found in the falcon a truly appropiate symbol (Fig. 8). The author of The Imitation of Christ wrote: “Love waketh much and sleepeth little, and sleeping, sleepeth not!4.”” The ancient naturalists affirmed that the falcon, like the lion, slept without closing its eyes. The only thing I can say on this subject is that I have tried many times during the night hours to surprise my tame falcons with their eyes closed, and I have never succeeded. It has even been said that the bird has no eyelids, which is not so, for in death, the lids close by themselves over the bird’s eyes; but what is sure is that this bird’s sleep is extraordinarily light. The eye of Horus was often shown by itself, quite separate from the god’s person or the falcon’s shape, in the hieroglyphs or the decor of Egyptain art, in the form of a highly stylized bird’s eye (Fig. 9), an ideogram charged with meaning and evoking not only the vigilance of

from the Divinity for the life and happiness of mankind. His look purified the flesh of the dead as it consumed it, and it was believed that each year he brought new fire down to the world. Philippe Virey has drawn a very striking connection between this many thousand-year-old Egyptian ceremony of the new fire and our Christian rituals on Holy Saturday, considered by the Church to be rites of renewal!°. In Egyptain art, when the symbolic falcon wears a human head on its bird body, it is one of the representations of the human soul; and the bird’s nature admirably serves the role. Just as the soul must try to find the heights and not linger on the low levels of material things, so the falcon when it is free in the open air seeks the high places, the rocky summits or the tops of buildings, and enclosed in the falcon house or its master’s room, it will always perch on the highest point possible. Since for the Egyptian the supreme god was the Sun, whether in the aspect of Amon, Ra, or Aten, the highest sacred act is the union of LOU the soul with him. Behold the falcon when af- Fig. 9 The hieroglyphic ter a few dark days the sun comes out and it evssef Here receives the first touch of its rays: deliberately and at once, its eyes, round as the sun itself, turn to gaze at it and though they stare at and through the fiery disk they are not dazzled'®; its chest expands and lifts, its feathers fluff out. Even more frequently, it exposes its nape to the warm touch of the sunlight; then its wings spread and beat in a kind of cadence, and its whole body throbs in rhythm; one senses that the bird gives itself completely to the ascendancy of the sun. Young birds are especially expressive in a bath of sunlight. The theologians and mystics of ancient Egypt could not have found a better emblem to depict the holiest souls and the intensity of their meditations: “Hail, ye two divine hawks who are perched upon your resting places, and who hearken unto the things which are said,” says the Book of the Dead'’, and this, says Lanoé-Villéne, “seems to relate to the souls of the holy 220011

teachers of divine knowledge!8.” All this explains the funerary honors the Egyptians paid to the sacred falcons which they mummified carefully after their death before sending them to Buto to be buried, as Herodotus describes (Fig. 10). There is no ancient text that I know of that supports our certainty that the early Christians in Egypt made the falcon a symbol of Christ. On the other hand, the evidence of the inscriptions proves that

“wom ’ "o£ Amon and Isis!9. According to Dolger?°, André Boulanger mentions a jewel engraved with the image of the god Horus and the designation: “CHRISTOS?!”; and in that inexhaustible treasure-house of our past, the Dictionnaire d’Archéologie chrétienne, Dom Leclercq teproduces a painting of the Christian catacomb of Karmuz, in Egypt, which represents Jesus trampling under his feet the lion and the dragon, according to David’s saying??; and he compares this work of art with an Alexandrian stele in the museum of Gizeh which shows the god Horus trampling underfoot the Typhonian crocodiles??. There was an advanced Christian school in Alexandria in the third century known as the Didasculum?+, which strove to harmonize with Christianity everything in Egypt’s religious past that could be accepted by the new religion; and it was understood here that wherever the falcon appeared in the old monuments of Egypt are falcons, and not eagles. The eagle was very rarely employed as a symbol in ancient Egypt, but after the introduction of Christianity it appeared a little more frequently, in connection with the prophecies of Ezekiel and in representations of the Evangelists. Aside from these two cases its use was so exceptional that in the fifth-century church of
Baouit, where it was pictured holding the Key of Life in its 202



THE FALCON
talons, the artist found it expedient to write at one side: AETOC: “This is an eagle.” In Egypt’s past, the falcon was not only the emblem of the human soul but also that of resurrection, like the eagle. It seemed indeed that the Christian religion had given to the falcon of Horus all the eagle’s chief mystical and allegorical
meanings, even while conserving its pre-Christian connotations
as the “symbol of life, of continuity, perhaps of eternity?>.” It was easy to make this transfer. As we have seen, the eagle represented Christ’s triumph; and in ancient Egypt, the falcon took part in all the triumphs of the pharaohs, the sons of Amon. Among the Ancients, the eagle was above all others the solar bird; in Egypt, this was the falcon. Among the Greeks and Romans, the eagle was the emblem of resurrection; and the eye of Horus’ falcon purified the dead and prepared them for a new life. For the Christians, because of its hatred for reptiles, the eagle was the sign of Christ the warrior against evil, and we have taken note of the Alexandrian stele showing Horus crushing the crocodile beneath his feet. Other parallels can be drawn, and we can be certain that at least in Christian Egypt, the falcon was one of the symbols for Christ. It might also be noted that in western Asia, this bird appeared in very ancient times as the destroyer of evil spirits: “the falcon slays the evil demons with iron talons,” and the Rig-Veda says that the god Indra often takes on the falcon’s
form2®,
Like the bird of paradise, the falcon was placed by a certain form of symbolism at the service of the third person of the Trinity. At the beginning of the sixteenth century, the mystical society L’Estoile Internelle, in which later was incorporated the Fraternité des Chevaliers du divin Paraclet (Brotherhood of the Knights of the Holy Paraclete), invoked the Holy Spirit in the guise of the dove to ask for the gifts of piety, fear of God, wisdom, and counsel; and behind the symbol of the fal
con, to implore him for the gifts of knowledge, intelligence 220033



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST

and strength?’. A superb altar-piece corresponding with this symbolic theme is found in the church of Notre Dame of Croaz-Batz, in Roscoff, Finisterre. It is composed of seven sculptures in alabaster, the Annunciation, the Nativity, the Flagellation, the Descent from the Cross, the Resurrection, the Ascension, and Pentecost. On the first and last of these sculptures the Holy Spirit is represented by a bird: in the Annunciation, by a dove; in Pentecost, by a falcon soaring above a hearth of flames directed downward, above the Virgin and the Apostles
(Fig, 11).
In heraldry, there was a figure called “flight,” composed of a pair of wings joined together without a body. Some heraldists, especially after the Renaissance, took these to be eagles’
Fig. 12 The heraldic image of flight.

THE FALCON
wings, others said they were those of the falcon which was much more common and familiar than the eagle and unquestionably one of the best-known birds to the creators of the heraldry of the nobility. In that noble science, the “flight” represented the chosen soul enamored of a high ideal, which has thrown off the domination of matter and dwells in the luminous heights. In religious heraldry, the “flight” was the symbol of the spiritual being, and above all others, the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete. The hermetists who used the symbol with the same connotation showed it descending from the sky; that is, with the wing points above (Fig. 12). The “flight” which goes up toward heaven, with the wing points downward, more clearly depicts spirits that strive upwards while still attached to bodies, showing the highest aspirations of our souls. In the same little-known places which I have just mentioned, a similarity was drawn bEb
between the heraldic spiritual “flight” and Fig. 13 The double-bitted the holy symbol of the ancient world, conse- — %e; from apainting crated to the fire cult, of the double-bitted Pe, aa ee axe, called by the Romans the Bipennis, the “axe with two wings” (Fig. 13). The name, as well as a certain similitude of shape, is an indication of the connection of these ideas. Furthermore the fact that the “two-winged” axe is an ancient symbol of fire brings it into closer relationship with the divine Spirit which on the day of Pentecost showed itself in the form of tongues of flame. In the same way that the falcon was taken to symbolize the Holy Ghost by the fraternity of [’Estoile Internelle at the end of the medieval period, the same bird was also the chosen emblem of certain associations and companies of workers in roof construction. These workmen found falcons and their nests in the high roofs of towers and cathedrals, and the very pose of the bird at the moment of flight took the exact shape of the 220055



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
roofers’ hammer; which explains the drawings of the hammer and the bird next to each other found on the walls of the fifteenth-century chateau of Montsoreau in Anjou (Figs. 14). This reminds us that the Ancients often found hidden meanings in the positions and shapes of animals and birds. Tertullian says: “Cattle and wild beasts pray in their way, and so also the bird which lifts itself toward the sky makes the shape of a cross with its wings spread as a man does when he prays and extends his arms7®.” Although as we have seen the falcon was allotted an exceptional number of noble roles in the Christian past, in general the raptors were more often taken by the teachers of the Church as images of demons who ravish the souls of men: the writings of St. Thomas of Villeneuve and St. Alphonse de Liguori2®, in these later centuries, testify to this. To those well acquainted with the Middle Ages and the great favor in which falconry was held, however, it seems that this ugly role was confined more or less to the raptors called “ignoble.” In the symbolism of the epoch, the sparrow hawk was the figure of Envy?°. In a thirteenth-century stained glass window in the cathedral of Bourges, a raptor devours a heart (Fig. 15), in spite of statements by Pliny?! and Aristotle? that falcons and

sparrow hawks never eat the hearts of their victims. Perhaps it is the demon of Envy that should be seen in the Bourges raptor, which tears the heart of anyone it possesses.

THE OWL
HE RAPTORS WHO fly by day have often enjoyed a favorTite reputation in ancient symbolism—the goshawk, the merlin, the gyrfalcon, not to mention the eagle, are noble birds; but the sinister, nocturnal flyers, especially owls, are
“birds of ill-omen.” Only one kind of night-flying raptor in
spires a certain sympathy, at least in some French provinces:
this is the little chouette-chevéche or chevéchette, the pygmy
owl!, the size of a quail, which is very common in France, and whose call in the darkness is not at all frightening. Of its own accord, it accompanies the late traveler along the country
roads, and often makes its nest and raises its young on the roofs of dwellings. The country people divide the nocturnal raptors in two cat
egories: the chouettes, which have smooth heads without any crests of any kind, and the hiboux whose heads have two tufts of feathers like horns or ears. This classification, which depends only on the bird’s exterior appearance, corresponds to the way of thinking in ancient times in which owls were un
popular except for the little chouettes, which were very numerous in Athens and all of Greece and were looked upon with great favor there as well in the rest of the ancient world.
It seems that the symbolism of the owl, like that of the swan, comes to us from the early people in the far North.
And as in that region and that far-off time the swan symbol
ized the birth of daylight, the owl would on the other hand
symbolize the mystery of the shadows of night. This is the 220099

significance which the Lapps and other northern races still recognize in the handsome chouette-owls of their country which they look upon as the white spirits of the night, for the plumage of these birds, except for a few streaks of very pale rust color, is almost as snowy as that of the swan? (Fig. 1). In some parts of Scandinavia, this bird is made the emblem of moonlight. The symbolism of the owl seems to have followed the same route as that of the swan, down from the Pole toward southern Europe. We find the oldest religious and talismanic images in the Ag «= provinces of European and Asiatic Russia which Fig. 1 The white owl extend along the chain of the Ural mountains, as af the Nar: far as Hellenic Asia Minor, and into Africa, via Egypt (Figs. 2 and 3). In Greece in Mycenaean times, the most ancient representations of the goddess Pallas Athena, the Latin Minerva, show her with a woman’s body and the face of an owl?. Several variations of this Aegean idol, of the same date, have been found in Abyssinia, with the peculiarity that the personage represented sometimes has no mouth’. Returning to Greece, we find Athena’s bird represented on a number of coins of the Golden Age, which were called by the name of the bird they pictured, glaus (Fig. 4). Everywhere in the old world they were signs of Athenian prosperity; “to send owls to : Athens” was a common saying in Rome to indicate Fig. 4 Archaic. unnecessary generosity”. Athenian coin. The symbolism of the owl was used for Minerva by the Latins just as it was for Athena among the Greeks, in spite of Ovid’s translation of a later legend telling of Nyc

THE OWL
timenus’ penitential transformation into an owl®. We might add here the words of Johannes Lydus: “Athena was called Glaucopis because she shared the nature of fire; and the owl, her sacred bird, stays awake all night to signify the human soul which is never lazy, always in movement by its very nature, which is immortal’.” In the bird that sees clearly in the dark when all others are blind, and when it is hunted has the good sense and the caution to remain hidden all day, the Greeks saw a symbol in which were united the three qualities of wisdom, knowledge, and prudence. For this reason they connected it with Athena, the chaste goddess of wisdom, who issued from the head of the supreme god. “The owl’s eye shines in the darkness like the glory of the wise man in the midst of the foolish crowd,” says an old text. Some people have claimed that eating the eggs of the owl makes a person temperate and well-balanced; this seems to be an echo of what Pliny says of the beliefs current in his day, according to which the eggs of the nocturnal flyers mixed with wine were a cure for drunkenness. In Asia, also, the owl was always a venerated symbol. In explanation of this, the Kalmuck Tartars of Mongolia tell that their great emperor Genghis Khan (1162-1227), pursued by his enemies, was saved by the presence of an owl perched on the thicket where he lay hidden. In the seventeenth century, the French heraldist Vulson de la Colombiére repeated this legend; but it does not explain the origin of the veneration in which the bird was held long before the time of the Tartar hero’. In spite of some disagreeable connotations, in the main the owl was still regarded in medieval times from the point of view of the Ancients. Especially in the monasteries, where all day long the bird keeps to its place on the wall or in the hollow tree, it was taken as the sign of meditation. In the lamaseries and hermitages of Tibet, it is also taken as the image
of the disciple who performs his period of “retreat” from the 221111



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
world, isolated from all others, during which he works inwardly to attain the mastery of his spirit over his body. Symbolizing this ancient practice of meditation, the owl, according to Lanoé-Villéne, became “the symbol of the light of the Holy Spirit illuminating the dark soul of the unbeliever®.” The owl, especially the chouette, also had the honor of being likened to Christ. Eustathius, archbishop of Thessalonica in the twelfth century, expressing the view of his time, said that the owl’s clear vision in the darkest night was due to a luminous force in its eyes which could dissolve the shadows. In the same way, the mystics said, Christ by the power of his divinity always and everywhere sees all, and no mystery exists for him. Another aspect of this connection was brought by applying David’s words in the psalm to the Savior abandoned by his friends in his Passion: “I am like an owl of the desert!°.” The bestiaries, less daring, were at somewhat of a loss in comparing Christ with the nocturnal raptor. Here is how the twelfth-century Armenian Bestiary studied by Father Charles Cahier extrigee ores cates itself from the difficulty: “It is ai eee dead i said that the nocturnal bird loves the a church at Bouchet, Vienne. night more than the day. And our Lord loves us who are in darkness and who dwell in the shadow of death. But it will be said: the night bird is unclean under the Law, how can it be compared to Christ? And I will show you the passage from the Apostle where it is said: ‘Him, who knew no sin, he hath made sin for us, that we might be made the justice of God in him!!.’” In the decorative art of the Middle Ages, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish whether the image of the lone owl is intended to represent the student of holy scripture or the for- 212



THE OWL
saken Christ (Fig. 5). Often the milieu is a help: in a cloister, for instance, or on the outside of a church, especially if the bird is perched on a book or a scroll, it is usually the meditative student. Inside the church, it is clearly a symbol of the Savior when there is a cross drawn on its breast or head!2, and it may very well represent him if it is on the gospel rather than the epistle side. This latter is so for the following curious reason: the hatred for Jews of the medieval Christians classified them with other outcast groups, such as sorcerers and ‘practitioners of black magic, whom the owl symbolized in its evil sense, as a bird of darkness. It was said that as the Jews were blind to the light of the gospel, in the same way the owl closes its eyes to the light of day. Since it is on the epistle side of the church that lessons from the Old Testament, the Hebrew Bible, were read in the Catholic liturgy, images of the owl are more frequently seen on that side of the church!. It was quite natural that in popular symbolism, Satan, “the prince of darkness,” should be represented by the owl, the bird of night, especially the barn owl, the ghostly “diabolic bird” that we see on ancient amulets with which evil spirits were evoked. The owl was also the emblem of the demon of avarice!+, and symbolists have contrasted its lunar character with the solar one of the eagle and the falcon!’.

THE SWALLOW
TT SWALLOW HAS always and everywhere been one of mankind’s favorite birds. Among the ancient Egyptians, numerous local legends cluster around it!. The texts of the Great Pyramids and the Book of the Dead testify to the existence of a swallow goddess; a high official of the fifth dynasty, who was a priest of the double axe, was at the same time her priest?. This cult lasted until the end of the sixth dynasty when it disappeared from the official liturgy; but from the earliest to the

ligious teachings and arts made the swallow the image of the human soul, which it was said assumed the swallow’s shape in the course of its transformations’. This explains why the bird is so frequently represented on mummy cases (Fig. 1) and in tombs (Fig. 2), connecting the idea of resurrection and the freedom of the spirit separated from the body with the soul of the one who has died. The swallow also entered the touching ig, myth of Isis, who was said to have taken the form of a swallow to go to Byblos to
bewail the death of Osiris*. In Babylonia, the swallow’s image was consecrated to the goddess Aruru-Ninmakh>, and seems also to have symbolized the idea of liberation into a life after death.

221155



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
In some of the most beautiful of the Egyptian sacred texts
the smoke of incense, which has been the symbol of prayer
ever since those far times, is compared to the swallow. And
because of its flight that lifts it toward the sky and also because of the soft, earnest twittering of its call, the Ancients of classical times also made the swallow, called chelidon by the
Greeks, the image of prayer. In Greece®, the urgent, sup
plicating chant with which the poor begged for alms was called chelidonisma; it was a kind of hurried and confused
psalmody which tried to imitate the swallow’s twittering,
chelidoniso. For the Greeks this graceful bird also symbolized
that discriminating moral taste which makes a person avoid
bad company; for it was said that the swallows shunned
Thebes in Boeotia because it had weakly allowed itself to be taken twice, and also Bizia because of the crimes of Tereus,
whom the terrible Procne punished so severely before she herself was changed into a swallow’. The swallow’s return in the spring after its winter’s absence,
not only to the region but to the very nest which it built in preceding nesting seasons, was for the Ancients, as it is today
in many places, one of the most natural representations of the
idea of resurrection. The wind which blew at the moment of the swallows’ return, the softest and sweetest of all the breezes
that move under the skies of Greece, was called by the Greeks the “chelidonian wind®.” It is not only the regularity of the annual reappearance that
has given the swallow its symbolic character; this is also sup
ported by a mistaken belief, which lasted for centuries, that, as Aristotle and the Ancients claimed, the swallows of the
northern countries bury themselves in the winter in piles of
leaves or in the crumbling wood of hollow trees, or even in
the silt of rivers, whence they emerge in spring as from a
tomb. Painstaking research by eighteenth-century naturalists
caused these notions to be placed in the category of fables!®.
But all in all, ic is easily comprehensible that the former
Christian symbolists made use of the swallow since an early 216



THE SWALLOW
period to depict the triumph of the Redeemer at Easter. A
very ancient Armenian legend tells that on Good Friday eve
ning, all the swallows of Judea and Galilee gather around
Jesus’ tomb, and as Easter dawns they fly swiftly away in pairs
to all of the countries of the world to carry the startling
news: “The Lord is risen indeed: alleluia!!!” Today, the swal
low still enacts the role of the herald of Christ’s rebirth; and
in several parts of France, the country folk consider it a fa
vorable sign if they see the newly-arrived birds between the
two triumphal feasts of Palm Sunday and Easter.
The whole ancient world took the
swallow to be a bird of light. Pliny says
that ic makes use of a plant with golden
sap, named in its honor chelidoine, the
celandine poppy!? (Fig. 3), to cure the
eyes of its young or others of its kind.
This flower, which is very common in
fle-de-France, was a popular motif
among the sculptors of the great Gothic
cathedrals during the thirteenth and Fig.3. The celandine
fourteenth centuries; and perhaps it was Peppy of France and its
because of this that the swallow became otra
one of the Middle Ages’ emblems for architecture!?. In any
case, we find the celandine poppy, “swallow flower,” in the
decoration of the cathedrals of Paris, Rheims, Amiens, Beau
vais, Chartres, and Bourges!*, as well in a number of less im
portant churches.
Pliny recommends the use of swallow’s blood as an ingre
dient in eye lotions for human use, and Celsus and others, in
deed the whole body of Greek and Roman medical opinion,
were in agreement!>. Popular tradition also echoed these be
liefs; in Biscay it was claimed that anyone who killed swallows
needlessly would go blind in old age, if indeed that person
lived to grow old!6, It was believed moreover that in every
swallow’s body there was a marvelous stone that would not
only improve or restore sight but that possessed many other 221177



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
virtues as well. It could be red, black, or white. The archbishop of Rennes, Marbode, who wrote during the reign of King Philippe Auguste of France (twelfth century), states that the red chelidonian stone cured lunacy, mania, and declining health, and helped to develop eloquence; the black stone promoted success for one’s projects and the water in which it was soaked strengthened the vision!”. Relying on such ancient fantasies, the bestiaries, which were the unquestioned manuals of medieval symbolism, and the works derived from them, stated that when the young swallows showed a premature urge to escape from the nest to go out and see the world, the parent bird itself destroyed their eyes before leaving them, but on returning, according to a bestiary quoted by Father Cahier, “it makes its little ones see clearly. No one knows how it does this, nor with what means!® (Fig. 4)”; perhaps, as Tertullian says, this miracle was wrought by the application of the celandine poppy!?. The medieval bestiaries also declare that the swallow here symbolizes the Redeemer who gives, takes away, and gives back the light of the soul and of the intelligence to the human being according to his merits or to the needs of his spiritual welfare.

In some parts of the Mediterranean. coast, the swallow has been made a symbol of hope and is then shown head down

bird drops down to earth from the sky, its curved wings and long tail feathers give it the shape of the anchor which from the time of the catacombs has symbolized the theological virtue of hope?! which also comes down from heaven into the heart of the Christian (Fig. 5). In several provinces in France this same idea gave the celandine poppy, the “swallow flower,” the connotation of “awaiting a joy that is soon to come??.” The seventeenth century also made the swallow the symbol of the Lord, who withdraws from the soul when it darkens and becomes cold, and who returns to it when it regains its ardor. In the same way, the swallow leaves a region invaded by cold and fog, and returns in the warmth and sunlight of spring??. On the other hand, its annual departure and return, and the astonishing instinct that brings it back exactly to its family nest, have connected it with the parable of the Prodigal Son, and the allegorical image of the sinner who departs from Christian life and practice, but returns at last to the Church. Since the ancient naturalists, who provided so much matetial to the early Christian symbolists, related the swallow with the cure of epilepsy, Pliny suggested that an excellent remedy for this illness was to eat young swallows taken from the nest;
and as a preventive amulet, he recommended a small stone,
also taken from the bird’s nest, different from the chelidonian 221199



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
stone?+. Epilepsy, madness, convulsions, eclampsia, hysteria, and other illnesses of the same sort were generally ascribed to the influence of evil spirits, so it was quite natural that a symbolic connection should be made between the bird thought to cure these attacks and Christ who in his earthly journeys cast out evil spirits. The swallow’s continual aerial pursuit of insects strengthened still more its image as the enemy of demons, for flies and gnats were commonly taken as representatives of maleficent spirits even before the coming of Christianity?>, in which the fly symbolized equally the demons and Satan. One translation, though apparently faulty, still is given of the name of Beelzebub (the Baal of the city Zebub)?° as “king or lord of the flies.” We shall speak of this again in connection with the symbolism of the bee?”. In certain parts of France, swallows’ nests are still considered to protect the houses on which they are built; I have heard peasants in Vendée say that a swallow’ nest, even in winter, frightens off the demons of the night. In several provinces, the nest is commonly accepted as the ideogram for a human family dwelling so well endowed with warmth and concord that it is the place to which the family members always return, as does the swallow. Those who wilfully tear down a nest risk being themselves made to fall victim later to the grand mal of epilepsy?8. A complete reversal of what has just been said about the swallow’s pursuit of insects is that in the last three hundred years, various symbolists have taken the swallow as the image of Satan the ravisher of souls, which he pursues as relentlessly as the swallow pursues the gnats. I know of only one other symbolic theme, that of the spider, in which the fly and the gnat symbolize human souls; their usual role is to represent the spirits of hell. Some others have also tarnished the swallow’s image by
making it represent various human weaknesses: inconstancy,
because when it is flying it seems never to stop anywhere, and also because every year it leaves the country where it was 220



THE SWALLOW
born; impurity, because it touches the ground only to gather mud, and builds out of mud the place where it dwells?9. The heraldists of the nobility after the Renaissance were also severe with the swallow: “The swallow,” said the bestknown of them all, “represents the flatterer, and the false friend, because in winter it goes away and leaves us?°.”” Others, however, have made it the symbol of prudence.

THE NIGHTINGALE
N GREEK MYTHOLOGY the nightingale is the reincarnation Ik Philomela, the sister of Procne, the swallow, who took a terrible revenge on the cruel Tereus who had betrayed them both. The transformed Philomela withdrew into the shade of the woods where she sang in the summer nights whenever these tragic memories assailed her. This sorrowful theme from the Greek fable did not exert as strong an influence as some others did on Christian symbolism, however, for the nightingale very early became for the Christians one of the emblems of joy—that joy that ever since the soul-testing days of the Roman persecution was the outstanding characteristic of the Christian spirit! and which medieval spirituality called “The holy joy of the children of God.” There can be no doubt that the nightingale was one of the birds uppermost in the thought of the artists who decorated the subterranean sanctuaries of Rome, during the first four Christian centuries, where so many small birds flutter among the painted flowers and garlands. The medieval bestiaries, by whatever name they call the nightingale—Oussegnol, Rousegnol, Roussigneul, Noussigneux —also make it the symbol of the holy joy which fills the righteous soul. In the thirteenth century, Pierre le Picard wrote of it: “This is a small bird which the Physiologus tells us prefers beautiful gardens and forests where it sings all night, but louder when the dawn approaches; and at sunrise it shows
great joy in itself and its song. And it is the image of the 222283



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
holy soul which in the nighttime of this life awaits our Lord, the true Sun of Righteousness, and when it feels that he has
come into its heart, it experiences such joy that it cannot keep
silence? (Fig. 1) Although there is no mention in this medieval text of the ancient interpretations by which the nightingale was made one of the symbols of Christ, the divine Word, it is no less certain that the early mystics, tracing the stream back to its source, saw the incarnate Christ as “the author of our joy.”” Moreover, symbolists before and after Pierre le Picard often saw in the night chant of the nightingale an image of the divine Word that made itself heard well before Christian times by the mouth of the Hebrew prophets and of the inspired ones among the Gentiles’. In the same epoch in which le Picard wrote, St. Bonaventure cele

Its sweetest notes are those that herald the dawn, but when the sun shoots forth its first rays, the bird’s voice lifts up at once louder and sweeter, and it sings without pause or rest. At the third hour it seems to exceed all measure: its joy exalts itself higher and higher, its breast seems about to break with its exertion; the sound of its voice mounts with ever-growing force; it is consumed with ardor. But when at midday the sun sends forth its hottest rays, the bird’s fragile body gives way under the excess of its singing. Its voice fades out in its still-opening beak, its body throbs with a supreme effort, and at the ninth hour it gives up its last breath. “My son, I wish thy soul to become this Philomena who 224

lives and dies in its song of love. May life appear to thee only as a day of waiting, whose hours are marked by the blessings of God, before the eternal tomorrow of the marriage of the Lamb*.” This last song of the nightingale is like an echo of that of the swan, whose symbolism is almost exactly the same.

THE LARK
N THE Near East, the lark of our meadows and wheat fields, alauda arvensis, the skylark, was the subject of a legend even older than the literature of Greece, which we find reflected in the works of Theoctritus, Aristophanes, Aesop, and several other writers. According to this story, the lark was the first created being on earth, and since entering this life it has enclosed—literally “buried” —its father and creator inside its head: whence the crest it carries so gracefully!. The Greeks called the lark korydallis, from korys which means “crest,” and which was also the word for the crested war-helmet. We shall see later how this crest connected the bird who wore it with the symbolism of Christ. In France the crested lark was called cochevis. In the very ancient mythologies of some northern regions, the lark was considered to be very closely related with the “Spirit of the Wheat,” who was thought to bestow the same mysterious influence on both graceful bird and nourishing plant. After the introduction of Christianity in these same regions, the “Spirit of the Wheat” was more or less identified with Christ, who according to the testimony of St. John, said of himself: “I am the living bread which came down from heaven?.” All of this symbolism comes from the lark’s predilection for its favorite dwelling place:
The lark makes its nest
In the unripe wheat... 226



THE LARK
To the farm laborer, the lark is a daily sight as it skims over the sown fields or the neighboring meadows, and starts up from the green wheat to rise like an arrow straight toward heaven, seeming to penetrate the blue sky so high that the human eye can no longer see it; and this has given rise in the countryman’s mind to a very simple and expressive symbolism. First of all, the lark seems to him the image of prayer, which is a lifting up of the human soul toward God; because when the bird reaches the dizzy heights it soars there for a time singing with all its strength. In France the peasants of the western provinces call their little children to show them the bird and tell them that it is praying up there to the Christ Child for the children and the sowers of the wheat. The lark is also a symbol of joy and of freedom in our countryside. An anonymous seventeenth-century writer, among many others but more Fig:! The crested lark of France aptly than most, took the lark as a eager ez symbol for the Savior saying to his disciples before his Ascension: “I go to my Father, and there I shall pray for you.” Then the holy text says that “while they beheld, he was taken up: and a cloud received him out of their sight*.” St. Gregory seemed to be referring to this symbolic ascensional characteristic of the lark when he wrote: “It is right that the Lord should be called a bird, because his body was lifted up into
the air.” Although not specifically a worm-eater, the lark must nevertheless be classed among the active destroyers of larvae, small worms and caterpillars; it is a special enemy of the harmful harvest beetle (Fig. 1). Plutarch says that formerly larks were held in great honor on the island of Lemnos because they devoured the eggs of the locust®, the big destructive grasshopper which Christian symbolism, taking its
authority from the Bible’, uses as an emblem for Satan. 222277



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
The water-lark or sea-lark is found everywhere on the shores of the English Channel and the North Sea, and even on the most desolate rocky islets off the coast of Brittany. This bird, the anthus obscurus of the ornithologists, nests on the ground, and is very similar in size and color to the skylark, which it also resembles in the way it springs up toward the sky, lingers there for a few moments and then drops down again almost vertically’. The sea-lark is a great favorite with sailors and with the people who live on the shores of the Channel, but I do not know if they have made it a part of their religious tradition, to which its habits lend themselves equally with those of our beloved skylark.

THE. DOVE AND THE RAVEN
The Sparrow and the Crow
ECAUSE OF ITS mild and peaceful habits, its attachment to Bis mate, even its color and its song, the dove, from the
beginning of ancient humanity's use of symbols, has been taken as the ideogram of peace, purity, simplicity, patience in
suffering, and conjugal fidelity. Horapollo believed that doves
put to death any of their kind that commit adultery!, and the
Ancients insisted that this bird had no gall bladder, and consequently knew no malice. The oldest evidences of the cult of the dove are found in the island of Crete and in the ancient Hittite empire in Asia Minor, and are even earlier than any traces there of the use of metal (Fig. 1). The scholar Gustave Glotz writes: “We find baked clay models of doves dating Fig.1 The divine dove of
from the Neolithic era and continuing — rete on the sacred columns;
almost to the end of the pre-Hellenic foe OE
period. Before becoming symbolic votive offerings, these little
figures were actually idols to whom sacrifices were offered of stone-martens, which are enemies of birds. In those times, the
dove was a strong enough symbol to serve as a talisman for the dead?.” In this Cretan world, at the time of the beautiful middle- 222299



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
Mycenaean art, the dove, like the fleur-de-lis, was shown everywhere, and later, the great goddess of Cnossos would wear it on her head as the very emanation of her divine nature. Among the Hittites, the supreme goddess Astarte also was crowned with a dove made of, or plated with, gold, as a sign of divinity?. In Phoenicia also, the dove was also the bird of the great goddess of love, Atargatis, who is the equivalent of the Hittites’ Astarte. Lucian says that a golden dove, which seems to have more or less explicitly represented the spirit of the divinity on earth, was paraded twice a year on the coasts of Syria*, and the inhabitants were forbidden to eat the flesh of Atargatis’ bird>. Diodorus Siculus, recounting the death of the famous queen Semiramis, who called herself the daughter of Atargatis, describes how “she suddenly disappeared; some people claimed that she was changed into a dove and flew away in the middle of a flock of these birds that had been seen swooping down over her palace at the moment of her death®.” The very name of Semiramis, Diodorus also says, means “dove” in the language of the Assyrians, who were the Syrians’ neighbors’. Witness to the fact that this cult of the dove extended east from Syria to Babylonia and Susiana is a big dove-image made of lapis lazuli, found by Jacques de Morgan during his excavations at Susa®. It can be observed also in the old cults of Persia and India? Among the Philistines the dove was the tutelary bird of the city of Ascalon, and the goddess of that city also carried it as a divine emblem. The name Pleiades, “doves,” was given to the priestesses of Zeus!°, and Ovid recounts the metamorphosis into doves of the daughters of Anius, king of Delos!!. This bird was especially dedicated to the goddess Aphrodite, among the Greeks, and to Venus by the Romans. In the Greek archipelago and in greater Greece, the human soul was sometimes pictured as a dove with a human head, alittle like the androcephalous swallow of the
Egyptians which was also an image of the soul. Here doubt- 230

less we find the explanation for the little doves in various Sicilian tombs; they appear also sometimes in Gallic and GalloRoman burial places (Fig. 2). Of all the symbols from the earliest times that the Christian church adopted, the dove was perhaps the one most frequently shown on the walls of the catacombs in Rome and elsewhere, on the tombs of martyrs and saints in the first Christian buildings, on ritual vessels and lamps, and in all the liturgical art. It represents especially the Holy Spirit and Jesus Christ, often also the faithful, and later it became one of the emblems

of the Virgin Mary. It always indicated divine peace and the Christian virtues of purity, gentleness, simplicity, and resignation. One of its first roles in Christian art was to call to mind the biblical story of Noah’s ark. Everyone knows from childhood the part played by the dove in the Flood story and how by means of the olive branch it announced to Noah the abating of the waters and of the tide of God’s anger (Fig. 3). This quite naturally led Jews and Christians, first of all, to the idea of the olive branch as a sign of peace, and of the dove as its symbolic herald. In Christian representations of this event, the ark became the symbol of the Church, and Noah that of the Christian soul to whom the Christ-Dove brings peace, depicted by the branch. A Roman epitaph shows a ship carrying two jars or amphoras, and perched on the high stern, the dove of Christ brings his
peace. Nothing in this case evokes the memory of the deluge 223311

or of Noah. The ship is the Church; and it is well worth
while to remember that although the amphora, on account of
its shape, in ancient times represented the pregnant woman!?,
in Christian symbolism it was also one of the signs for the Reservation of the Sacra

has the same triumphal meaning as the palm.
The white pigeon or dove was chosen by almost all the
Christian artists to represent the Holy Spirit. The sacred
texts which were most influential in this choice were certainly
the passages from the Gospels that recount Jesus’ baptism in
the waters of Jordan by John the Baptist. The other St. John speaks thus of the Baptizer: “And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending
from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him. And I knew
him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same
said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descend
ing, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth
with the Holy Ghost. And I saw, and bare record that this is
the Son of God.”
Thus, from the beginning of Christian times, the dove ap
peared in decorative art as the accepted emblem of the Holy
Spirit. The first representations of Christ’s baptism naturally
portrayed it above the Savior’s head, and shortly after Con
stantine’s Peace, the mosaic workers who decorated the great
arch of the Basilica of St. Mary-the-Greater, in Rome, placed
above Mary’s head the image of the dove descending from heaven at the moment of the Annunciation. Sometimes seven doves with halos, gathered around the fig- 232



THE DOVE AND THE RAVEN
ure of Christ, represent the seven perfect gifts of the Holy Spirit which Jesus promised his apostles he would send them after his death: “But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all
things!4.” The seven doves are also to be seen around the
Virgin Mother who was “the living tabernacle of incarnate wisdom” and “filled with the gifts of the Holy Spirit.” There are examples of these representations of the seven doves sur
rounding both Christ and Mary in the stained glass windows of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries at Chartres, Mans, Saint-Denis, Freiburg im Breisgau, etc.!° Although the dove was used less frequently to symbolize the Savior than to represent the Holy Spirit and the faithful
soul, it was nevertheless numbered among the personal em
blems of Christ since the earliest days of Christianity. In the
second century, this symbol was accepted by the Church, if we can believe Tertullian’s testi
mony; writing at the same time
that the Carthaginian potters were producing ritual lamps decorated with the symbolic dove, he said: “The dove usually represents Jesus Christ!®.”” Often, too, the dove appeared in the first Christian art between two fishes!” who unquestionably stood for the faithful; and it is customary to find between them a personal emblem of Christ, towards which they are moving. The same idea is given by an earthenware dish in the Nardoni collection, on which two doves adore another, larger dove placed above the shortened monogram of the holy name XPistos!® (Fig. 5). On picturings of the “mystical deer hunts” of the Mer
ovingian dioceses of western France, the dove soars above the deer, the emblem of the soul, which is pursued by dogs

THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
representing the passions—and which runs from them at full
gallop toward the cross. On one example (Fig. 6) of these “hunts” found at Nantes and at Rezé (in the region of the
lower Loire), the dove is carrying inner peace to the harried
soul and above it is shown a cross lying along the length of its body!®. Here, the dove is Christ bringing the help of his divine grace. As the bird dedicated to the goddess Venus, the symbol of human love to the people of ancient times, the dove has kept this same character as the bird of love in the most advanced Christian symbolism. So perhaps we must recognize in the mutual caresses of the doves, on the frescoes of the catacombs, a more subtle expression of the same symbolic mean
ing indicated in those depictions of Eros kissing Psyche, by
which we believe that early Christian art allegorized Christ’s love for the loving and faithful soul?°. The symbolism of love and that of fire have been closely linked since ancient times, and I might mention in passing the
presence of the dove on many Christian lamps of the early
centuries?!, But I think it should be remembered that the
mysticism of the Middle Ages emphasized the connections between, on one hand, the love of God and of Christ for humanity, and on the other, the new fire which the priest lights and hallows in the liturgical office of Holy Saturday; and it seems that an old legend says that in the church’s early
days, there was a miraculous dove which brought the new fire
Fig. 6 The dove and the deer hunt; Nantes, 6th or 7th century.
to the principal church in Jerusalem, every Easter Eve. In this role, the dove is the messenger bringing to the earth both spiritual light and the fire of divine love. Some medieval mystics took the white dove as the image of the essence of the Deity, without distinction of Person, at the same time one and threefold. This was however an infrequent
usage and very little known in our times. But there are images 234



THE DOVE AND THE RAVEN
of doves placed sometimes in the midst of a nimbus, crowned with a triangle of rays, or perhaps framed by a triangle, which are more often seen in the religious art of the Mediterranean than elsewhere. These seem to relate more to this concept and to be less an emblem of the Holy Spirit than of the
Trinity. Sometimes, though rarely, the dove has allegorically taken the place of the Virgin Mary because of the connections that the Song of Songs makes between this bird and the Bride chosen over all other women; and also because it symbolizes perfect purity, on account of which the dove presents a satisfying picture of her whom the Church calls the Immaculate. In this tole, the dove was nearly always shown in a way whose significance could not be mistaken. But certain hermetic groups of the Middle Ages accepted a complete correspondence between the Person of the Holy Spirit and that of the Virgin Mary. This view was based on a particular interpretation of this pas-’ sage from Genesis: “God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them??.”” This was taken to mean that there must then exist in God a masculine and a feminine principle; and since the divine feminine cannot be either Father or Son, it can only be the Spirit. So it was thought that the Holy Spirit was actually incarnated in Mary’s body at the moment of the Annunciation. From the beginning of Christianity, this concept of the femininity of the Holy Spirit?? and the Virgin as one of its earthly manifestations was found in certain Gnostic sects; and this theme is explicitly stated in the apocryphal Gospel to the Hebrews. Speaking of Jesus’ temptation in the desert, this ancient work gives as Christ’s words: “...my Mother, who is the Holy Spirit, lifted me by my hair and took me from the desert to the high mountain Tabor?+.”” This concept, which was adopted by the Albigenses and which some heterodox groups in Italy also accepted, still has adherents today who call the Holy Spirit “Madona divinita.”
In fact, some doves of these times that represent the Holy 223355

Spirit are stylized in such an exaggerated manner that the bird has lost its natural shape and assumed one that strangely resembles the initial letter of Mary’s name. This is the case with a dove painted on a small wooden panel from the presbytery of Fontevrault (Maine-et-Loire), of the sixteenth century (Fig. 7). There are some medieval representations of the dove in stained glass windows that are similar in type??. The art which followed Constantine’s Peace often represented the Apostles by twelve doves; on one of the flat sides of the altar of St. Victor of Marseilles, the doves fly six by six toward the Constantinian monogram of Christ?®. St. Paulinus of Nola relates that in his episcopal city there was a cross surrounded by twelve doves which signified the Apostles?’, and on a large mosaic of St. Clement in Rome, upon a cross bearing the body of Jesus are scattered twelve doves whose meaning is instantly clear?®. As we have seen, the dove very often represents the faithful Christian soul. The sense of orientation, of knowing which direction to take, that best qualifies the pigeon over all other creatures to be a messenger for human beings, was applied by the masters of Catholic spirituality to the symbolism of souls. 236

They said that in the same way that doves find the way back to their dovecote, no matter how far away they may have been taken from it, Christians must keep the sense of direction that guides them back to their dovecote, which is the Church. In its aspect as emblem of chastity, the dove was contrasted in medieval symbolism to the sparrow. We see, for instance, Chastity personified by a young woman mounted on a unicorn, and holding in her hand sometimes a flower, sometimes a dove; and on the contrary, Lewdness rides on a goat and carries a sparrow on her shoulder or in her hand. We see the idea thus depicted at the end of the fifteenth century, in the Livre d’Heures of Marguerite d’Orléans, countess of Angouléme; the painter, thought to be Simon Marmion, painted an ardent youth astride a white she-goat, holding the sparrow in his hand, and written beneath, one word: Lewdness (Fig. 8). Later, during the sixteenth century, Goltzius, in an engraving of Lewdness, made it feminine, accompanied by a buck goat, and in her hand the lustful sparrow whose excesses of mating have earned it this role in symbolism. Well before our era, the Greeks and Romans had established the sparrow’s lascivious reputation??. But the humble sparrow, with no exact name, has also played its small part in the official symbolism of Christ. The custom of keeping small birds in cages must be as old as the world: the Greeks and Romans, and many others before them, like us, Fig. 8 The sparrow, emblem of lust; constructed elegant prisons for them ee ey of wicker and of metal, and the first Christian artists who decorated the catacombs often depicted birds in cages, or escaping from them. In this latter case, the symbolic sparrow certainly represented the human soul delivered by death from the bondages of life, mounting joyfully to heaven. 223377



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
The sparrow has also been made the hieroglyph of Christ, deserted on the Mount of Olives just before his Passion, when all of his disciples had gone away except three who were nearby, but asleep. The Church describes this moment of anguished loneliness by the words of the psalm: Vigilari et factus sum sicut passer solitarius in tecto: “I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top?°.” The monastic heraldic bearings of Dom Granet, Cistercian abbot of Sénanques (1898), carry this symbol of the Bird-Christ alone upon a roof top, with the device: Sicut passer soli
tarius in tecto (Fig. 9). Once, at least, sparrows represented the Apostles: several apocryphal books of early Christian times relate that one day the child Jesus, playing near Joseph’s workshop, made Fig. 9 Coat-of-arms twelve little birds out of clay; he breathed of Dom Grasset, on them and they came to life and flew off. Abbé of Séanque. Mystics have seen in these twelve clay sparrows the image of the twelve Apostles whom Jesus chose among his many followers and whom the breath of the Holy Spirit, at Pentecost, made into new men?!. ; The best-known antithesis to the dove is the raven, due to the biblical story of the Flood?? and also to its color and its character. Many ancient Christian works of art show the dove arriving at the Ark and the raven flying away. Dom Leclercq gives several examples of such testimony from the first Christian centuries??, and the illustrated bibles since the sixteenth century, like the numerous illuminated medieval manuscripts, almost always show the flight of the raven, which did not return to the Ark. In devotional literature, the raven represents the devil himself#+. Teachers of Christian spirituality, such as St. Augustine?>, interpreted its cry by the onomatopoetic “Cras, cras!’—cras being a Latin word which means “tomorrow.” Because of this croaking sound, the bird is taken as exemplifying the careless sinner who postpones his conversion
238



THE DOVE AND THE RAVEN
always to the next day. Other teachers have made the raven the image of the pagan, the faithless, the renegade, or the shameless person, because it feeds on unclean foods*®, On the other hand, Benedictine symbolism, supported by the Golden Legend, has made the raven the special emblem of St. Benedict and of his monks, since the dove represents his sister, St. Scholastica, and the Benedictine nuns; every coin
has its good side. All the corvine family, not only ravens and crows but also the rooks and jackdaws common in Europe, must unques
tionably be classed among the most intelligent of birds, and probably that is why the Ancients connected them with rites of divination. In Germany, the worshipers of Wotan-Odin dedicated the raven to their god, and two of these birds, one named Hugin, which means “thought,” and the other Munin, “memory,” accompanied him everywhere and made everything in the world known to him37. And among all of the corvines, crows are the most intelligent and the
most sociable. The Greeks and the Romans took the crow as the sign of longevity: Aristophanes claimed that it lived five times as long as the human being #8, Horace spoke of “the century-old crow which Fig 10 Crow on the coat-of-arms
announces rain?9”’; and Ausonius af- of the Hunyadi of Hungary;
firmed that this bird “goes on living sculpture from the chateau three times three ages*°.” Exaggerated ob aiden LD sere as these statements are, it is a fact that the crow is hardy and long-lived (Fig. 10). At one time the Greeks and Romans considered the raven a bird of good omen, and the crow as one of evil*!, Quite on the contrary, however, Herodotus tells that one day two black doves flew away from Thebes, in Egypt, one going toward Libya and the other toward Greece, where it stopped at ane
Dodona, in Epirus. There, this black dove, in human lan- 239



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
guage, commanded the people of Dodona to build a temple
where great Zeus would deliver his oracles. In these black birds Herodotus sees two swarthy Egyptian priestesses. How
ever, the worship of Zeus did not have any place in the
Theban region of the Nile Valley, and some commentators think that crows must be understood instead of black doves. It is not surprising that Christian symbolism in Asia Minor and the Near East sometimes gave the crow the same mean
ing as that given in the west to the dove and the turtledove, in regard to the reciprocal love and fidelity between Christ and the Church. Others praise above all another of the crow’s qualities, its maternal love and devotion. The crow also depicts the Virgin Mary, in whom the Church recognizes the Beloved of the Song of Songs, which
sings to the virgins of Israel: “I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon. Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me...#2”; and by this “sun,” say the old mystics, must be understood the sun of love which sets holy souls afire and burns away even the smallest stain.
The Latin liturgy has sanctified this symbolism in applying the antiphon Nigra sum sed formosa (I am black but comely) in the most solemn prayers*?. Formerly the mystics applied these
same words also to the Church, as is proved by this passage
from La Queste del Saint Graal, of the thirteenth century: Par
le noir oisel... doit entendre sainte Eglise qui dist: Je suis noire mes ie suis belle: sachez que mielz volt ma nerte que autrui
blancheur ne fel: “By the black bird...must be understood Holy Church which says: I am black but I am beautiful: know that my blackness is of more worth than the whiteness of any other*4.”” In certain French provinces, the jackdaw is called “the Nun,” because its favorite nesting place is in clock towers, where it is awakened every morning, like the nuns, by the bells ringing for the morning office*. White crows, formerly greatly venerated, exist only as iso- 240

lated cases of albinism; but the fowlers of ancient times tried
to
a
bring about this phenomenon by soaking the baby birds in special liquid, before their feathers appeared. Usually the chicks died from these premature immersions. The crow has no mystical significance in heraldry, and on medieval coats of arms it usually represents someone of the black or brown race, a Moor or a Saracen*®.

THE SWAN
HE SYMBOLIC SWAN, immaculately robed in pure white, "Teomes to us from those northern countries that are nearly
always blanketed in snow. A study of the oldest signs of hu
man presence in these upper European regions shows that the swan was the first bird to appear in their developing symbolism. Who were the people who lived then under the magnificent
sky of those harsh lands? They had no sooner begun to add tools of copper and bronze to their already skilfully worked
utensils of stone when the swan made its appearance everywhere in their decoration, as the graceful expression of their belief in a luminous superior being, the master of the world and the father of their race. The prehistoric archeology of the ancient peoples of Finland, Scandinavia, and Denmark provides numerous examples in bronze of the solar boat or chariot, both ends of which are in the form of a swan’s neck and head. This indicates that for those races the swan had the significance that Apollo would
later hold for the classical countries as the image and personification of the Sun-god, of his radiant splendor and the gifts of heat, light, fruitfulness, and joy which he sends to the world from on high. This is why their artists harnessed the swan not only to the boat! or chariot, but also to the solar wheel; and in that connection it becomes a symbol very like that of the sun horse.
It seems most probable that this pure and noble prehistoric 224433



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
symbol was handed down in very early times from the
northern regions to central and southern Europe, since from
the Bronze Age onwards, it is found in Hibernia, Germania,
southeast Gaul, and Lombardy. A fragment of a belt tip dis
covered in Liguria, mentioned by Déchelette, which seems very clearly to belong to the same remote epoch, shows us the swan in front of the solar wheel? (Fig. 1); one would say it was Scandinavian work.
Fig. 1 The swan and the solar wheel; We find also the astral swan in
bree tol Be Paty een Greece; but who will say by what unknown routes it came also to be the symbol of the sun in
the Veda of ancient India*, or how it arrived at the designation there of the conveyance of Brahma’? I will add here that it has been claimed by serious writers
that symbolic characteristics very similar to those which the
northern peoples attributed to the swan were connected
equally with the duck, especially the white duck.
Greek mythology, inherited by the Romans, brought the
swan into a number of its stories whose original meaning is
hidden from our eyes, no doubt by the changes and additions
brought by the centuries which have passed since they were
first written down. Various personages appear under the name
and form of the noble white bird: Cycnus of Tenedos, the son of Poseidon (the Romans’ Neptune), whom Achilles found was invulnerable to any weapon and whom he could vanquish
only by strangling him, and whom the gods turned into a swan; another Cycnus, the son of Ares (Mars to the Romans),
whom Heracles conquered and slew, but whose father brought
back to life in the form of a swan; then Cycnus, the king of Liguria, who so loved his cousin Phaethon, Apollo’s son, and
wept so much at his death, that the god of light changed him into a swan and placed him among the stars°®.
In all these poetic fantasies about the changing into swans 244



THE SWAN
of various men named Cycnus, there is one thing to remember: that they all relate to a kind of resurrection hidden behind the image of a miraculous transformation. The Greeks, who sometimes harnessed the swan to the chariots of Dionysus” and of Aphrodite, connected it above
all with Apollo: their legends tell how at the moment of his
birth in Delos, the infant god leapt into the midst of a flock
of swans who sang a melodious hymn of praise for his com
ing. The bards said that every year, in the autumn, the Sun
god Apollo went back to the far North where behind a bar
rier of ice reigned a perpetual spring, bathed in the still light
of a silvery sun. And the god of beauty dwelt there among
the swans, who brought him back to the palm groves of Delos
in a golden chariot as soon as the oleanders budded there and the first flowers began. The same poets sang of the marvelous maternity of Leda.
From the heights of Olympus, Zeus-Jupiter loved the grace
and beauty of this young princess of Etolia, and in.the shape
of a glorious swan, the king of the gods came down to her
while she slept in the shade at the foot of Mount Taygetus.
As she awoke, she heard the divine bird saying: “Leda, do not
be afraid; I am the king of heaven, and I wish you to be the
illustrious mother of my twin sons, who will live like the sun
and the moon, one giving place to the other. They will be
named Castor and Pollux, and they will become gods whose

THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
benevolence will soften the harshness of death for human be
ings®.” Nine months later, Leda produced a miraculous egg
from which emerged two children exactly alike: “From their
birth, the same star sparkled over their heads; later they rode
the same white courser, and bore in their hands the same jav
elin? (Fig. 2).”
What fragment of truth is hidden in these astonishing sto
ries? We might remember here that several of the most
thoughtful of our present-day mythologists look on all these
stories of impossible adulteries and rapes among the ancient
gods as manifestations (perhaps too realistic for our taste) of
an imperishable belief, anchored by the earliest traditions in
the soul of our race, in the possibility of a bodily union be
tween humanity and divinity descending from heaven.
It certainly seems, however, that in the last pre-Christian
centuries, whether or not the “key” was still retained by some
initiates, there no longer existed a general understanding of
the meanings behind most of the ancient myths, and so for
most people the stories of lovely Leda and the swan were no
more than charming fables of sensual games. But if we place
ourselves strictly within the boundaries of art, we have to rec
ognize that marvelously lovely images were drawn from this theme by the classical artists, in sculptures, carvings, and es
pecially in the engravings cut in semiprecious stones. As for the egg from which the Dioscuri, Castor and Pollux,
were so strangely born, its symbolism is connected with that
of the fossil sea-urchin which we shall study later on; here we
shall simply note that the swan’s egg, like that of the snake,
was considered in ancient times as being related with the Egg
of the World, and consequently mysterious. The Dioscuri’s origin from it would, it seems, have caused them to be looked on as swan men!9, It is not surprising that in Christianity’s first centuries de
pictions of the fables of Zeus the Swan and Leda were rare in the decorative art of the West; there were some notable ones, however, and as Father Le Cour has written, “It must in any
246



THE SWAN
case be observed that Leda’s adventure was not looked upon as a carnal act by certain churchmen.” “Leda’s adventure’? was however quite widely used as a sculptural motif among the Christian communities of the Up
per Nile, and it would be extremely interesting to know what
was the thought behind this singular choice for the decoration
of churches in what could only have been a purely ornamental
function. It is quite possible of course that it was simply the
fact of the fecundation of a virgin by the swan god, seen as a
sort of prefiguration of Mary “overshadowed’’ by the Holy
Spirit: “The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power
of the Highest shall overshadow thee!?.”” Was it the same
thought that prompted the pope to have the image of Leda beside her swan reproduced on the great door of St. Peter’s in Rome? We find the swan by itself on some Christian lamps: Dom Leclercq cites eight ornamented with birds which he classifies as “Swans or Pelicans,’’ of which some are clearly swans!?. It seems that in former times a link that is now obscure for us connected the swan with the cross of Christ, at least in the western provinces of France. In the fifteenth
century, Gilles de Laval, baron of Retz (the ' TEL Bluebeard of Perrault’s tales), who was a Fig. 3 The “Cygne de companion of Joan of Arc, carried on his [2 Croix” on an old

coat of arms the heraldic cross of the Laval French commercial sgt
family; on his seal the shield bearing the cross is held by two swans, and the crest of the helmet is a swan. In the seven
teenth century, during the reign of Louis XIII, the hostelry of the “Swan of the Cross!*,”” where Laubardemont lodged!’,
had on its signboard a white swan marked with a cross. Paul
Reboux has emphasized that “there still exist commercial
houses having as their trademark a swan whose neck is
twisted around a cross, and with the legend Au Cygne de la 224477



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
Croix!® (Fig. 3). It has been suggested to me that these crossbearing swans could be considered as images of Christ carrying the Rood. This may perhaps sometimes be the case, but there is not the slightest proof of it, although they bring to mind much of the symbolism connected with Christ, and must be something more than a play on
words.
It should also be remembered here that the constellation known as “The Swan” is é : “formed principally of six stars, of which Fig. 4 An aspect of the ‘five form a great, slightly crooked cross, constellation of the Swan lying in the Milky Way!7(Fig. 4).” on the Milky Way, Jesus the son of Mary was probably not in November from Paris. the first Christ with whom the Scandinavian people connected the swan. Well before the belated conversion of the Nordic races to true Christianity, there existed among them a beneficent deity whom they called Balder, who was the king of true, pure love and of beauty in all its aspects. The first incursions of Northerners into the countries to the south, providing contacts with the last of the GalloRomans or with the Gallo-Franks, may well have given them a certain acquaintance, however vague, with Christian doctrines, long before their ninth-century invasions of the French and British coasts; for it is really astonishing to see how deeply the Balder myth bears the Christian stamp, to the point that he was called the “White Christ.” From the more southern countries, then, according to Per Skansen, “the belief in the White Christ, strange, pure, appealing, would spread through the whole of the North: and Balder, god of beauty, justice, innocence, and love, whose precepts were admired by all but followed by none, is formed on the pattern of the Son of Man himself!8.” The swan in its total whiteness could not fail to be connected with this White Christ, who evokes the idea of the true Christ in his transfiguration, when he showed himself “exceeding white as snow!?.” 248



THE SWAN
Because of its liking for clear water, and its white plumage—more absolutely white than that of the dove, the ibis, or any other bird—the swan, in the northern countries
which were unaware and so untroubled by the classical south
ern story of Leda, became one of the emblems of chastity, of
the perfect purity whose sole archetype in Christian thought was Jesus Christ. With the swan and the dove, then, we have the emblems of two kinds of chastity: one active and austere, the other more
gentle and more feeling; for example, monastic and conjugal
chastity: “One like the swan and the other like the dove,” as
Victor Hugo says?°. With this symbolic meaning, the legend
of St. Brigitte, queen of Sweden, tells us that the great wild
swans of the northern seas, drawn to her by the perfume of
her virtue, came to alight on the frozen pond of Kildare to be caressed by her saintly hands. We are not speaking here of the big cygnus ferus of Lapland
and Siberia as much as of the wild cygnus olor, which is the
only variety whose young are born absolutely white; those of
the others are first gray—as indeed are even those of cygnus olor when domesticated in Europe. It would seem to be the precept of
purity, the purity necessary to ap
proach the Eucharistic “sacrament of love,’’ that we have to understand when we look at the medieval sculptures showing, in different ways, two swans drinking from the chalice (Fig. 5). And because among the Ancients it was always, like the dove, the symbol of love, the swan was also an emblem of the ideal and perfect love, filled with the “candor” (Latin, “whiteness”) which its plumage evokes. There is a legend—only a legend,

THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
tive!—that when it becomes aware that death is about to re
lease it from its ties with the earth, the swan sings a beautiful
song of liberation, with the light of another life shining before
its eyes. Callimachus, Theocritus, Euripides, Lucretius, Ovid,
Propertius, Aristotle, and other Greek and Roman writers
have celebrated that lovely melody of the death-song of the
swan so convincingly as to cause our older French writers to
say that “swans have even been observed dying in the midst of
their music and the singing of their funeral songs”!.” Pliny,
however, had warned that this belief was erroneous, but what
he said did not prevent Bruno Latini, at the end of the thir
teenth century, from explaining that the swan is advised of
death’s approach by one of the feathers on its head which en
ters its brain, “and thus it perceives its death, and thereupon
begins to sing so sweetly that it is marvelous to hear, and thus
singing it ends its life??.”
The ideal, imagined beauty of this pre-death song has pro
vided the mystics with elements of comparison, not only in
speaking of the joyful death of saints, but also in celebrating
the sublimity of the most touching words which Christ ever
spoke and which St. John recorded as the true testament of
his Master23. They were spoken a few hours before his death
and immediately after celebrating the Eucharistic Supper. We
cannot blame those who have dared to compare this divine
song of love and sacrifice with the swan’s song of the ancient
poets.
Still other connections have been made: in the North, sto
ries were told of wild swans coming of their own accord and
letting themselves be captured by the harpist who played so
excellently as to charm them. This provides the allegory of
Christ, divine swan of heaven, coming to the one whose
prayer reaches a sufficient intensity; since the time of King
David the psalmist, the harp has been the symbol of such fer
vent prayer, which is essentially a call from the soul to its
Savior. A beautiful thirteenth-century miniature, from the
Bibliothéque de l’Arsenal, reproduced by Father Charles 250



Cahier, gives a naive image of the swan yielding to the spell of the harp?4 (Fig. 6). The same learned Jesuit says further, quoting the literal text of a thirteenth-century bestiary from Picardy, “It is a true melody to hear, when the Swan attunes itself with the harp to sing??.” There is a Greek legend according to which the swans assemble in the “royal isle” of Basileia, and there alone are able to harmonize together the songs that each one of them can sing only at the moment of death. This legend was taken as an allegory of the gospel passage where Jesus tells his disciples that he will always be present among them when several

are gathered in his name?®. It is rather a strange coincidence that in the folkore of several northern and European countries, camomile was called “swan weed.” The flower of this plant, like the field daisy, has a yellow center with white petals radiating out from it; this image is very frequently used in the ancient sacred art of the North, and also of Media, Susa, and Babylonia, and considered a symbol of the divine Word and its radiating expansion through the world. Like the peacock, the swan has also found its place among the emblems of Christ guiding to heaven the souls he has saved. Here also is simply a continuation into Christian times of a symbolic characteristic connected with the swan in earlier centuries. Two successive phases must be recognized in this symbolism of the “Way of Salvation”: first, the crossing of “the sea of this world” by the faithful soul, then its ascension toward “the kingdom of heaven.” When it symbolizes the first of these journeys, the swan shares the role of the dolphin which we shall come to later; we shall see that the dolphin is
sometimes represented in the earliest Christian art carrying on 225511

Half a Roman lamp of Christian manufacture, found in
Carthage, shows us a swan pulling a boat in which there are
three passengers under a sort of canopy held up by the cen
tral mast?” (Fig. 7).
In the Middle Ages, especially in Germany, the Low Coun
tries, and the north of France, the poets and artists of chiv
alry took over this theme for works of romance and heroism,
and the swan became the noble bird par excellence. In the
thirteenth century, Wolfram von Eschenbach produced the
poem of Lohengrin, celebrating the hero’s deliverance of the
princess of Brabant with the help of a miraculous swan who
guided his boat to her. This was a theme for the troubadours,
but the mystics saw in it something more than the image of
the pilot-swan and the knight charged with doing “God’s
deeds” on earth. An anonymous manuscript, The Order of the
Noble Knights of the Swan?8, dating from the time of Louis
XIII, contained these words, following an account of
Lohengrin’s adventure: “Thus Our Lord, the true Swan of
God, descended from heaven to earth for our salvation, and
led the Church his bride over the sea of this world (Fig. 8).”
The second journey, the ascension of the soul toward
heaven, was envisaged as having two different, successive
stages: first, Christ inspiring his follower by his grace, thus
lifting and maintaining his thoughts above the common level
af earthly life: then. with the coming of death the liberator, 252



THE SWAN
who breaks the soul’s bodily bonds, Christ draws it to heaven and receives it there to establish it in everlasting peace. For this ascension of the soul carried by Christ to the heavenly kingdom, symbolists found an allegorical image in classical myth. Camarina, we are told, like Amphitrite and several other nymphs, was the daughter of Oceanus”. Her home was in Sicily, on the cool shores of a blossoming marsh whose waters nourished the most beautiful fishes and the most colorful waterbirds, and there the nymph passed her days happily. But the gods summoned her to come to them, and a large, beautiful swan approached her, lifted her gently and took flight toward the empyrean. Soon afterwards, a city was founded near the marsh which she had loved, and the nymph, now a divinity, protected it. But there came a time when the inhabitants of the city disobeyed the oracle and drained the marsh beloved by their protectress; after that, their enemies entered by this new approach and sacked their city?°. During
its golden days, before it became ungrateful, the city of Camarina struck superb coins, imitating Grecian art, and representing the nymph seated gracefully on the back of the swan
which carries her toward the skies over the calm waters of her
marsh. Antiquity also recognized in the swan one of the enemies of the redoubtable serpent, and this above all, it seems, opened

the door in central and southern Europe for its admittance
among the symbolic fauna of Christ. It is certain moreover
that the swan feeds freely on the little eels and young snakes
of the marshes, and we often find it represented in their com
pany on the jewelry of the Bronze Age. A

and to defend him two swans hold them
off at a safe distance?! (Fig. 9).
In French heraldry, the swan is often
the sign for courage allied with beauty.
Aristotle said of it that “it is not afraid to
Fig. 9 Prebistoric gold do battle with the eagle, and often is the
pendant from Aegina. — Conqueror3?.”” Often also on heraldic es
cutcheons the swan is the symbol of clean living and of purity
of conscience.
The Middle Ages had still another symbol which brought
forth very beautiful ornamentation in heraldry and which has
two different interpretations. It is composed of two swans fac
ing each other, with their necks intertwined. The heraldry of
the nobility made of this the ideogram of tender and faithful
affection, for the swan, although it knows how to fight, also
knows like the dove how to express love, and again like the
dove, it is monogamous. The attitude of the cloister, however,
was more severe than that of chivalry, and Vincent de Beau
vais, who wrote at the time of St. Louis
of France, states expressly that “two
swans with necks entwined are the symbol
of lascivious games and caresses??.”” But if
this had been their only significance, they
would not have been so widely exhibited
on the escutcheons of noble and worthy
families, such as the Darots of Poitou, for
le, whose bl h h Fig. 10 Armorial bearings

THE SWAN
(Fig. 10); this carrying of the wedding ring clears the symbol of all suspicion of anything unworthy. However, because the Romans harnessed the swan to Venus’ boat, as the dove was harnessed to her aerial chariot, and
also because of the role it apparently played in the myth of
Leda, the first Christian symbolists did sometimes use the swan as the emblem of lust, and the artists of the Middle
Ages and the Renaissance often did the same, forgetting that
the golden Aphrodite of the Greeks, mounted on her swan,
inspired in men the pure love of divinity. The symbolists of
Christianized Rome also let themselves be swayed by the habit
of the famous and wealthy Roman courtesans of anointing
themselves with swan’s grease, which according to Pliny en
hanced their beauty by preventing or even erasing wrinkles**.
Taken thus in its negative aspect, in complete opposition to
the mystical sense we have spoken of as the bird of purest
love, the swan becomes the symbol of those who are full of
hidden vices but who adorn themselves with the outward ap
pearance of pure souls: the “whited sepulchres” of which Christ speaks??. In the thirteenth century, Walter Map wrote in accordance
with this: Par blanc oisel qui avoit semblance de cisne doit on en
tendre Vanemi, et si voi dirai comment li cisnes est blanc par dehors
et noirs par dedenz, ce est li ypocrites: “By a white bird resem
bling the swan must be understood the enemy, and if I tell
you how the swan is white without and black within, thus is the hypocrite?®.”” Like the eagle, the heron, the stork, and the crane, who are
usually preeminent symbols of Christ, but who also occa
sionally represent Satan, the ravisher of souls, the swan some
times appears on ancient works of art with a fish in its beak.
Here without doubt the swan is the impure demon who has
snatched a Christian soul from the pure waters of a chaste
life, and will devour it without mercy. I reproduce here, fol
lowing Father Cahier, an imposing medieval swan holding in
its beak the unfortunate fish?” (Fig. 11). 225555

If my information is correct, the black swan, the chenopis
atrata of the naturalists, would not have been known to the
West until a comparatively late date, probably not before the
sixteenth-century discovery by Europeans of the big islands of
the Oceanian archipelago to which it was native. In any case,
the symbol for traitor and for Satan which was made of this
bird, simply on account of its color, seems of fairly recent his
tory. Artists of the last centuries have placed it in opposition
to the white swan which in this juxtaposition stands for the
virtue of loyalty or for Christ himself.

THE PELICAN
HE PELICAN, LIKE the swan, is a big web-footed bird,
sometimes as much as a meter in length. On the water, it
has all the grace and elegance of the swan; it is white, ringed
with salmon pink!, but its drooping wings and the huge pouch
sagging under its extremely long beak make it, in regard to
beauty, no more than the swan’s poor relation.
The European pelican, which entered Christian symbolism
as an emblem of Christ, was called pelekos by the Greeks,
from pelekus, axe, because the opening of its enormous beak,
widening out in the shape of a fan, recalls the ancient axe
head when the bird drops from the sky onto the fish swim
ming near the water’s surface, on which it chiefly feeds. The
ancient Greeks also called it the onokrotos, because they
thought its strange cry, krotos, resembled the braying of onos,
the ass.
A very old legend says that sometimes the young pelicans
are hatched in such a feeble state as to be almost lifeless; or
else that the parent bird on returning to the nest finds them
killed by a snake; or it may happen that the chicks are quite
lively, but that they treat the father bird shamefully, striking
him in the face with their wings and beaks, so that he, justly
enraged, kills them on the spot. But however the young ones
come to their death, after three days their father, seeing them
dead, is touched to the heart; he cries aloud with grief and
bending over their bodies he tears his breast with his beak so
that his bland pours over them. Under this warm shower very
258



THE PELICAN
soon the dead baby birds begin to stir and come back to life, beating their wings joyfully and burrowing into their father’s downy feathers (Fig. 1). In the second century of our era, the Christian author of the Physiologus picked up the fable of the pelican reanimating its young, and in the following century the Carthaginian potters represented the scene among the symbols of the Redeemer with which they ornamented Christian lamps*. In fact, it was this meaning that Christian symbolism gave it from the beginning: like the pelican’s young, the human race is dead to the life of the spirit, and soiled moreover by its sins. The Savior poured his blood over humanity, purifying it by his sacrifice, and gave it back true life. This is what all the medieval bestiaries expressed with varying degrees of felicity:
De son bec perce son coste He pierces his side with his beak Tant qu'il en a del sane oste So that the blood flows; De cel sane qui d’ilec est fors From the blood which issues from him Lors ramaine la vie et cors He brings life back into the bodies A ses poucins, n’en doutez mie Of his chicks, be in no doubt of it;
Et en tel sens les vivifie. And in this way he gives them
life? (Fig. 2).

THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
Neither this text nor scarcely any
other of the period says that the
symbolic bird nourishes its little ones
with its blood (since they are already
dead when it is shed upon them) but
that it purifies them of sin and
brings them back to life. This was
the way the fable was understood by
all the great mystics of the time
Vincent de Beauvais, Albertus Magnus, and St. Thomas Aquinas, among others‘. During the last three centuries of
the Middle Ages, artists very often
represented the pelican and its
brood on the top of the cross’, usu
Fig. 3 The pelican on the top of ally above the heading I.N.R.I. (Fig.
the cross, 15th century; in the Louvre. 3); sometimes they even gave the
tree of deliverance an extra branch whose foliage surrounds
the nest. I have at hand some thirty of these images, all of
which show the pelican wounding itself in the center or on the
right side of the breast; the bird thus represents the simulta
neously purifying and vivifying qualities of the blood which
Christ poured out upon the world. It would seem that Dante
had in mind this image of the pelican placed above the cru
cified Christ when he wrote of St. John:
This is he, this, who on the breast reclined Even of our Pelican; ’tis he who bore
The great charge from the Cross to him consigned®.
In the ancient art of the Church, the mystic pelican is
shown more often from the side than facing to the front; but
in both cases, it strikes itself with its beak on the right side,
ot, infrequently, in the center, but never on the left. If this
latter does occur in very rare instances, it is because of an er- 260



THE PELICAN
ror on the part of the engraver, who failed to reverse his model as he must to get a correct imprint. In the same way, the old representations of the crucified Christ show the lancewound on the right side of his body; also from the fifteenth century on, the images of Christ’s bleeding heart show it pierced on the right side. This iconographic rule was strictly observed until the fifteenth century. It goes back to the text describing a vision of Ezekiel’s, repeated in the Roman Catholic liturgy as an Easter anthem: Vidi aquam ... “Behold...the waters came down from under the right side of the house .... And it shall come to pass, that everything that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live?.” This text is sung before solemn masses and observances, while holy water is sprinkled to purify the
congregation. From the close of the sixteenth century, a lack of understanding of the authentic Catholic symbolism caused waverings in the strict rule prevalent until then that the pelican was always shown striking its breast from the right or center, never from the left. Later, during the eighteenth century, Freemasonry adopted and revived a number of ancient symbols, almost all Christian ones, retaining their already sacred meanings. The pelican was one of these, and it kept for the Masons two of the roles the Church had given it, those of representing the Redeemer and the virtue of charity (Fig. 4). Here is part of a dialog on the meaning which the Masonic initiate into the secret order of the
Rose-Cross should find in the Fig. 4 The Masonic pelican at the foot
of a cross bearing the rose and the compass;
wounded bird: 19th-century wood carving.
261



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
The Wisest One asks the Most Respectable candidate:
“Do you know the Pelican?”
“Yes, Wisest One.”
“What does it mean?”
“Tt is the symbol for us of the Redeemer of the World and of perfect humanity®.”
Since then, the pelican has expressed this meaning every
where among Masons who have firmly attached to it the icon
ographic characteristic of wounding itself alvays on the left
side of the breast, and of having its neck bent always to this
side, opposite to the traditional pelican in Catholic iconogra
phy; and this representation began to become generally ac
cepted, even in the churches. This came about in the
following way: At the end of the eighteenth and beginning of
the nineteenth centuries, Compagnonnage® was at its height.
Workmen of all trades and crafts went from town to town,
working for a certain time in each, in order to perfect their
skills; those affiliated with Compagnonnage were almost sure
of finding work and assistance on arriving in a new place of
any size. The Compagnons were numerous and Freemasonry
soon took charge of the institution; although it does not seem
to have been its founder, it gave the Compagnons secret signs
by which to recognize each other, and part of their own insig
nia, including the pelican as well as the triangle, the trowel,
the square, the compass, and the acacia. In fact, Compagnon
nage became a sort of workingman’s third-order of philo
sophic Freemasonry, and for some, an antechamber to the
Lodge.
By means of Compagnonnage, Masonry entered all the in
dustries, all the factories, all the workshops, and this facili
tated the substitution of the left-sided pelican for the
traditional representation of Christian art. And because Chris
tian artists as well as those who should guide them have aban
doned the study of the true and traditional principles of
Christian symbolism, sadly enough we see daily all sorts of
anomalies. In a number of churches the Masonic pelican dom- 262



THE PELICAN
inates the altar; it is seen on canopies, doors, on the vest
ments of priests, everywhere. But we should remember the words of Prof. Hippeau, quoted before}, that symbolic images are not arbitrary, and that they “constitute a kind of artistic orthodoxy” from which we depart at our peril!!. It was in the sense of total purification that the old alchemists thought of the pelican when they designated under the name of “pelican’s blood” the state of elements destined for the Great Work, after an initial purification!?. A legacy of their work remains in an instrument used in modern chemistry which bears the name “pelican,” a kind of one-piece alembic with two spouts from a tubular neck. But in the course of time, another idea became associated with the primary ones of purification, redemption, and resurrection which Christian symbolism had related to the pelican, and this later association has since become predominant: the idea that has made this bird the emblem of Christ’s love for human souls, exemplified in the gift of his blood in the Eucharist. In the twelfth century, Hugh of St. Victor, after telling the fable of the pelican, expressed himself thus: “We have struck our God in the face, we have denied him. And yet he gave up his Son to be tortured; the soldier’s lance pierced his side from which issued the water and the blood which have given us our redemption. The water is the grace of baptism, and the blood, the Chalice he has given us to drink of for the remission of our sins!?.”” Since the crown of love, or charity, is to give oneself, the pelican provides an excellent example of this kind of heroism. A number of fifteenth- and sixteenth-century miniatures showed the pelican above an image personifying Charity!*. It seems to express maternal love when it accompanies images of the Virgin Mary, and in clerical heraldry it speaks of the devotion of fatherly love among those who have charge of souls. In civil heraldry it also stands for paternal love extending into personal sacrifice. Musset refers to this in speaking of the
pelican: 2638
263



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
Slow-footed, climbing a high rock,
Sheltering his brood with drooping wing,
Melancholy fisherman, he gazes at the sky!
The blood flows in long streams from his open breast. . .
The Ancients had long ago attributed to Musset’s “melan
choly fisherman’ a native sadness that caused it to seek des
erts and desolate places. David lamented to God, “I am like a
pelican of the wilderness!©” —a cry of anguish that was later
applied by mystical writers to Christ in two circumstances of
his life: when he withdrew into the wilderness for forty days,
and particularly when he was abandoned by his followers in
the Garden of Gethsemane at the time of his arrest. A peli
can, accompanied by David’s text, expresses this on a medieval
stained glass window in the Cathedral of Bourges’’. This as
pect of the pelican is found on a number of works of art of
the past, but above all in literary imagery.
In our Western, Christian symbolism, there was complete
opposition between the pelican and the monstrous creature
called the vampire. The former pours out its own blood and
thereby gives life to those who have lost it; the vampire sucks
blood from its victims through a wound that it inflicts, and
causes their death. The former corresponds to the Jesu auctor
vitae of the liturgic text, the other represents the “Devasta
tor,” the “Prince of Darkness.” In the old legends and super
stitions of France and England, and above all in those of
Germany, central Europe, and the region of the Danube, vam
pites were thought to be the spirits of the wicked dead, who
come out by night from the tombs of rotting corpses and
suck the blood of the living as they sleep, after wounding
them in the left vein of the neck; they kill their victims
quickly by draining them of blood and sometimes even de
capitating them. Medieval art shows us these nocturnal evil
doers either in the form of a horrifying demon or of an enor
mous bat. There are in fact types of blood-sucking or vam
pire bats in the Americas, which are actually not dangerous to
human beings. But the beliefs of eastern Europe which linked 264



Fig. 5 The vampire bat, on the back of a choir stall in the Poitiers cathedral; 13th century.
the bat with maleficent nocturnal spirits are of very ancient origin, as the nykteris had an evil reputation among the Greeks, and Pliny reports that in his time they were nailed upside down to the doors of houses to chase away noxious spirits and magical spells of ill omen!8. In some backward areas in France to this day, bats that can be caught are thrown into the fire, in spite of their services as insect eaters. The huge bat of the thirteenth-century choir stalls in St. Peter’s Cathedral in Poitiers (Fig. 5) must refer to the idea of vampires, since Origen had designated the bat as the symbol of the heretic because it hides during the daylight hours, and because it shares the characteristics of both bird and mammal. In France, in any case, the heraldry of the nobility took the bat as the symbol of heresy. Medieval art sometimes gave bat wings to the mermaid; she can be seen thus on a fifteenthcentury cornice in the ancient church of Saint-Germain in Poitiers. She then becomes the image of Asmodeus, the demon of lust, who drains the fluids from the human being that are the life of the body, and dries up the fountain of grace that is the life of the soul. 226655

WADING BIRDS
HE FAMILY OF wading birds includes a number of species, among them the sacred ibis of the Egyptians, the stork, the crane, the heron, and the marabou. Although they played different roles in different places, a symbolism common to them all was that of good struggling with evil, and so later of Christ combating the Evil Spirit and his agents—no doubt because all these birds are formidable enemies of snakes and of a host of small animals and reptiles that are destructive or disagreeable. Many of the waders also are connected with the idea of wisdom and of guidance. In Egypt the ibis was the symbol of Thoth, who represented the action of the divine Word. In the Creation by the supreme god Amon-Ra-Ptah, the theologians distinguished between “the part played by the creative thought which they called the heart, and that of the instrument of creation, the tongue!.” The divine heart, seat of eternal thought and intelligence, was called Horus, the falcon-headed god, and this holy tongue which actualized the sacred concepts by its speech was named Thoth, the god with the head of an ibis. Returning from Egypt, Plato wrote that in this country there was a god who had been worshipped since the earliest times, to whom the ibis was sacred. He added that this god, who was named Thoth, was the inventor of numbers, mathematics, astronomy, writing, and the game of chess, and had commanded the first pharaohs to spread the knowledge of these things among their
people?. It is because of this, Plutarch says, that the first 226677



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
character of the Egyptian alphabet has the form of an ibis’.
In Greece, the heron was one of Athena’s messengers, and
so partook of the quality of wisdom connected with Minerva
Athena. Lanoé-Villéne is probably right in saying that this
bird “must certainly have been taken in ancient times as one
of the symbols of sacred science*.” The religious ideas of the
ancient Toltecs of Mexico related the white heron to the ac
tion on earth of divine knowledge, and, in consequence, to
what René Guénon says of the ancient Tula of the Mexicans,
which owes its origin to the Toltecs: Tula is “the high point
of the world,” the Thule of the Greeks. On Mexican monu
ments the ideogram for Tula is the heron’.
In certain Asiatic regions, the marabou or adjutant stork is
still thought to have a strange power of introspection into the
human being which enables it to see clearly the state of each
petson’s conscience. Very ancient traditions connect this bird,
like the ibis and the heron, with divine wisdom; Guénon
wrote: “Wisdom is nearly always identified with the divine
Word, and as the marabou was a symbol of wisdom, it must
by the same token represent the Word®.”
Hesiod tells us that storks announce the propitious moment
for sowing crops, and the flight and cries of this bird, migra
tor par excellence, were carefully observed by ancient orni
thology: in the Roman empire, soothsaying and augury derived
omens and warnings of all kinds from them’.
The ibis was believed to be the means of helping the soul
to attain the eternal dwelling place of the divinity. According
to the religious poetry of Egypt, it was on the wing of Thoth
the Ibis that the gods who visited the earth were borne back
to heaven, and this was also the sure and holy vehicle which
carried the souls of the just to their eternal joy’. In Bengal, it
is believed that the marabou stork carries within itself the soul
of a holy Brahmin®: in like manner, the Indians of North
America say that herons contain the souls of wise men who
have returned to the earth on mysterious pilgrimages.
We know very little about the symbolism of animals among 268



WADING BIRDS
the Druids, but such writers as Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, Pliny, and various others have testified to the knowledge attained by their high priesthood, whose members, directly or indirectly, controlled practically all the phases of life among the Gauls. The symbolism expressed on Gallic coinage of that era, toward the beginning of the second century B.C., certainly could not have escaped their influence. On some of the oldest gold coins of the Gallic tribes, we find the symbol of the stork, most frequently placed on the back of a large animal, such as a horse or a bull. In these images Charles Renel sees these birds as spirits who direct the big animals; “sometimes the bird even holds the horse’s bridle in its claws, and at others its feet clutch the mane!®.” Certainly in these cases the birds occupy exactly the same place in which we find winged spirits with human bodies on other Gallic gold coins—those of what is now Poitou, for instance!, which inspired the coinage of Philip of Macedon. A Gallo-Roman altar found near the foundations of Notre Dame in Paris shows Fig. 1 The bull with three cranes, a bull with a crane perched on its head — "4 Gallo-Roman altar in and two others on its back (Fig. 1). In- the Slory Museum: genious hypotheses have been offered, but no absolutely satisfactory explanation of this puzzle, nor of a somewhat similar one in an altar at Tréves!?. The Egyptians saw in the ibis, as also in the marabou, a “world purifier,’ because it consumed carrion and other unhealthy substances. On the other hand, it would not touch water that was not perfectly pure. Plutarch wrote: “The Egyptian priests who are the most scrupulous in observing their rites, in order to purify themselves, take water from which the ibis has drunk, for it never drinks water if it is unhealthy or unclean and will not even approach it.” 226699



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
Aelian tells us that the Egyptian religion dedicated the ibis
to the moon, and that this bird takes the same number of
days to hatch its eggs as the moon to complete the cycle of
her phases!*. This is possibly true, but the real reason for the
Fig. 2. Thoth with the ibis’ head crowned with the lunar disk and crescent; in the temple of Ramses II at Antinoe.
connection is that Thoth was the god who
ruled the moon! and was often represented
with the lunar disk and crescent on his
head (Fig. 2). Another concept of Egyptian
religious thought connected the sacred ibis
with Osiris, and made of it one of the em
blems of resurrection of which the moon
with its waning, disappearance, and rebirth
is, like Osiris, a notable example.
René Guénon is right in affirming that
the ibis, the heron, and the stork play the
same symbolic role and that all three were
considered, and remain, emblems of
Christ!©, The gray heron, with the peniten
tial color of its plumage, had a particular
character of melancholy in the eyes of former symbolists.
Pliny had stated that this bird when oppressed by misfortune
weeps tears of blood, and this connected it in their minds with
the moment of Christ’s agony in Geth
semane when “his sweat was as it were
great drops of blood falling down to the
ground!”.”” The heron’s preference for
solitary places has also made of it one of
Christian symbolism’s rare living exam
ples of silence, a silence which is pre
cious because it leads the human being
from reflection to wisdom. Medieval art
ists, especially the heraldists, represented
this idea by showing the heron standing
and holding in its beak a stone that
keeps it from uttering a sound!®. This
ctane was called by the Ancients leuc

The cranes, handsome big birds and friends of mankind, opposed them, exterminating many and putting the rest to flight, pursuing them up to the walls of their city which Pliny calls Gerania (Fig. 3) (from the Greek name for the crane, geranos, geranion). The crane was a sacred bird in the Euphrates valley at the time of Babylon’s splendor, and also in Susa and Media. As these birds are willing to live in a semi-domestic state, they could be observed easily and the attitudes they assumed in their singular dances were taken as portents, since they were regarded as results of an almost divine inner state. As we know, all the various kinds of cranes perform a sort of dance at one time or another, sometimes with infinite grace and seriousness, so that our forefathers were led to give the bird’s name to foreign ballerinas; later, the name passed to women of light morals. In China and Japan today, stage entertainers train these birds to perform even more complicated dances?°. Old popular traditions in Europe dedicated to the crane the little wild geranium which grows in rocky places and has fivepetalled blooms of a lively rose-red. It is the prototype and
forerunner of all our garden geraniums, and is named for the 227711

pod represents quite well the bird’s beak which
is so terrible to reptiles?! (Fig. 4). This is
probably why in some western regions the wild
geranium is called “devil-chaser.”
Both crane and stork, mounted on the back
of a turtle, were taken as symbols of longevity
(Fig. 5). The Orientals allow the crane up to a
thousand years of life, a claim which remains
to be proved. Among the Greeks and Romans,
the stork was also taken as the symbol of piety,

representation of the two serpents on the

black magic. They are shown here exactly in the position of other entwined snakes which are presented in conditions which leave no doubt whatever of their satanic character—for example, on the elements of the sacrilegious Eucharist of Wintras, of which Eliphas Lévi has commented: “... instead of approaching each other in two parallel semicircles, the heads and the tails went outwards, and there was no intermediate line representing the caduceus. Above the serpents’ heads was visible the fatal V, the Typhonian fork, the character of hell23.” The wading birds of Monkwearmouth can only be the adversaries of the accursed serpents. Perhaps better-informed English symbolists could give the exact meaning of this strange symbol.

THE OSTRICH
N VARIOUS PARTS of the ancient world, the ostrich was Ticen as the symbol of stupidity, because of the mistaken idea that it thinks that by hiding its head in bushes or in the sand, it can make itself invisible to pursuers. In some other parts it represented gluttony, because it was thought that it would eat iron (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, it was also known in many places in more flattering aspects. In Nubia, Arabia, Per
sia, Sumeria, Mesopotamia, Assyria, and Asia Minor, the
learned scholars and teachers looked upon the ostrich as one of the birds most favored by various astral influences and as possessing in itself elements of the divine. The Greeks and Romans regarded the ostrich as receiving in particular the emanations of the planet Saturn, and of another star designated in the old texts by the name of Virgil! Elsewhere, in western Asia, in the most ancient centers of Brahmanism, where urine is considered a holy thing, the ostrich is revered because it is the only bird that has the faculty of urinating. The ostrich lays the perfect egg, the largest and most beautiful of all eggs; and in the mind of the Ancients, part of the effluences from the RRNA stars which the bird receives must be contained — Fig. 7 Symbol of

this incomparable egg became one of the litur- ood caring of the
gical symbols of Christ. 17th century. 227755



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
The old naturalists have told that the ostrich, which they
say with some exaggeration lays twenty-four eggs’, begins to
lay them in June, the month in which the star called Virgil
appears in the sky. The eggs are laid on a mound of sand
which the sun heats, and left there to hatch. But when the
moment comes for the chicks to emerge into the free air of
the desert, the ostrich, warned by its star, returns to the eggs
and hatches them with a single ardent look which summons
them to life.
The medieval symbolists claimed that the ostrich chicks
would never see the light if the parent birds did not soften
the excessively hard shells of their eggs by coating them first
with honey, and then moistening them with their own blood}.
One sees at once what meaning the symbolists of that time
could draw from this fable, nor did they fail to do so: “When
the blood touched it, the shell broke and the young bird es
caped swiftly; thus Christ broke the stone before the door of
the sepulcher and flew up to heaven to sit on his Father’s
right hand*.”” Others explain it like this: The honey is the
blessed image of Christ’s doctrine, and the ostrich’s blood is
that of the blood of the Redeemer; Christ gave us first his
teaching, then his blood, and by that double gift he liberated
humanity, his children, from the fetters of the “law of fear”
and from the shadow of ancient idolatries.
In the spiritual beliefs of present-day Coptic monks, the
heat of the sun that hatches the eggs of the ostrich is looked
upon as the symbol of God’s grace which brings virtue to
blossom in the soul of the faithful, especially that of the
monk, From another aspect, the ostrich itself, which always
moves straight ahead without ever turning, also represents the
monk who must always go straight forward toward perfection,
never looking back at the past and the worldly things he has
left behind.
Evidently the biblical severity in regard to the ostrich,
which blames it for abandoning its eggs and being “hardened
against its voung ones,” did not impress the old Christian
276

symbolists very deeply, since they made it represent the return to God of the wandering soul, and also the symbol of that virtue in which almost all the others are implicit, that of impartiality.

THE EGG
ROM THE DAYS of the most primitive human societies, the
Fue has figured as an important religious emblem and as
the ideogram of the starting point, the initial germ of life.
Primitive people knew instinctively what was later formulated
by the learned biologist Harvey in his famous aphorism: Omne
vivum ex ovo, “Every living thing comes from an egg” that is
to say, from a seed enclosed in some kind of envelopel.
From Egypt’s earliest dynasties, the egg was connected with
the idea of the beginning of everything and the very essence
of living beings. In ancient Crete, in the Mycenaean epoch
and during the last two thousand years before our era, the
symbolic eggs of large birds such as the ostrich, sumptuously
mounted like cups, were placed in the tombs of the wealthy.
Recent excavations made at Ur in Chaldea—the birthplace of
Abraham—have unearthed the tomb of Queen Sub-Ad, of
the fourth millennium before our era. Among the precious
objects in the tomb was an ostrich egg, mounted like a cup
on a tripod of fine gold; it is ornamented with plaques of
mother-of-pearl and incrustations of red stones and lapis lazuli
(Fig. 1). A copy of this ostrich egg in gold was found in the
same tomb.
I do not know whether a symbolic meaning should be at
tributed to the egg shells which are sometimes found in the
burial places of independent Gaul. The ones I have found
there? accompany the bones of animals, which show that a
“viaticum” for the future life was put in with the human re- 278



THE EGG
mains. The Gallo-Romans continued the ancient custom of placing eggs in tombs not only as provisions for the long journey, but also perhaps as a symbol of the life principle, of survival, in the very heart of death; also, to fulfill certain more or less traditional magical practices. That is why in this epoch whole owl’s eggs were sometimes placed near human remains, for instance at the Quenouilliére in Angoumois*. At Seurre, in Bourgogne, an egg made of white clay placed in the same way may well have had the same significance’, as well as a symbolic egg found in a tomb at Blois®. Macrobius tells us that in the Greco-Roman mysteries of Liber Pater, the egg “was so greatly venerated because of its oval, almost spherical, shape which has no opening of any
new A

THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
kind, and because it contains life in itself”.” And we might re
member here the crystal egg worn around the neck by the
great Druids in more or less this same period of time, which
has been thought to represent among other things their claim
to see into the future®.
The Romans, doubtless following the example of the Etrus
cans, ascribed to the egg a mysterious power of purification,
and also—perhaps springing from the same idea—that of
driving away evil spirits of the air from human dwellings. In
the sixteenth century Cornelius Agrippa of Metterheim wrote
that in the past the egg was used in purification ceremonies,
and from this came the title “lustral eggs,” and these verses
of Ovid: “Let an old woman be called who shall bless bed and
bedchamber, having sulphur and eggs in her trembling
hand?.” I have never discovered any trace of this ancient
meaning in any popular custom in France!®. But another con
cept, more oriental and Greek than Roman, makes the egg
or, more exactly, the ovoid shape whose natural model is the
egg—one of the symbols of linear, regular, perfect beauty;
and all the ancient arts have favored the use of the ovate
form in ornamental work. Following the custom in ancient
Egypt, the Near Hast very frequently gave the egg shape to
its lamps of baked clay, and in its first centuries Christian art
followed the same usage. In the New World, since time im
memorial the Sioux Indians of North America have believed
that storms are enclosed in the invisible eggs which a small
bird-divinity, the Thunder Bird, lays in a sacred place, where
they go with offerings of tobacco leaves!’.
The egg, like the seed—which is the egg of the plant
contains a promise: that of a new life which will soon emerge
and which nature has a right to expect from the very fact of
the egg’s existence. So it is quite understandable that the egg
was very early taken as a symbol of hope, and Christianity,
taking this idea to a higher level, made this feeling one of the
three theological virtues. St. Augustine wrote: Restat spes quae
auantium mihi videtur, ovo comparatur. Spes enim nondum pervenit
280



ad rem; et ovum est aliquid, sed nondum est pullus: “There re
mains hope, which in my opinion can be compared to the egg.
For hope has not reached its goal; likewise the egg is some
thing, but it is not yet the chicken!?.” This is certainly what
is also meant by the inscription encircling a little sixteenth
century ivory egg hanging from a ring of silver filigree, which
reads: Post tenebras spero lucem: “After the
darkness, I hope for light” (Fig. 2). And this
brings us to the best-known Christian symbol
ism of the egg, which expresses the highest of
all hopes: for a rebirth into a blessed life be
yond death. This explains the presence in
Rome of marble eggs the size of hens’ eggs in the tombs of martyrs!?, and often in the cata
combs natural eggshells!+. I myself have
found the hen’s egg in two Christian burials
from the period of the Franks (sixth or sev
enth century) at Saint-Marceau (Deux-Sévres) Fig. 2 16th-century
in 1900 and at Sammarcolles (Vienne) in 9mbolic egg in ivory;
1904. There is no doubt that in all these cases
the egg represents the idea of rebirth in the very bosom of
death!>.
It is not surprising that the people of ancient times consid
ered the most beautiful type of the egg to be that of the os
trich, not only on account of its size but also the perfection of
its shape. In addition, what the naturalists had to say about
the method of its incubation was enough to assure its place as
the truest symbol of the hoped-for resurrection. In the time
of King Philippe-Auguste, William of Normandy, echoing the
voices of the past, wrote that the ostrich lays its eggs in the
month of June, at the moment when the “Virgil Star” appears
in the sky; caring for nothing except its star, the bird buries
its eggs in the desert sand and forgets them, but the sun
warms them through the sand and the chicks hatch without
the help of their mother!®. However, the Physiologus says that
the ostrich calls its little ones to life, hatching them with one
de Fontaine’ collection.

look at the moment that the Virgil star announces that the
time has come!”.
An inventory of the Bayeux cathedral, established in the fif
teenth century, mentions an ostrich egg'® that is placed on the
altar on certain holy days (Easter and perhaps Christmas).
These eggs were sometimes hung in front of altars, like those
that are seen in the turbehs of mosques and even today over
tombs, where again they represent the idea of resurrection. In
the Middle Ages merchants set up their stalls near the en
trance pillars of Notre Dame in Paris and sold to those who
came to worship such things as candles, coconuts, ostrich
eggs, etc.? These latter were offered in the church like can
dles. There are still today ostrich eggs in almost all Coptic 282



churches, and in one of the great cathedrals of Spain, in Burgos, very large eggs are hung at the feet of the crucified Christ (Fig. 3). In certain cathedrals, it used to be the custom to place an ostrich egg with the Eucharist in the ritual of the “Tomb” on Maundy Thursday, and on Easter Day it was solemnly taken away at the singing of the “Invitation” at matins: “The Lord is risen indeed: alleluia!” It is quite clear that in this liturgical custom, the egg became the direct representation of the body of Jesus Christ, entombed and then raised again. An inventory of the fifteenth century of the treasures of the cathedral of Angers gives this interesting detail: “There are two ostrich eggs in a large reliquary hung on silver chains. On Easter Day, the two eggs must be placed on the altar of St. René...”2°, the saint born twice: Re-né, the saint brought back to life like the Savior; for in fact St. René of Angers, who died young, was miraculously revivified?!. In the Middle Ages, several of the big churches had ostrich eggs set up more or less richly as cups, some of which were reliquaries?*, and others simply formed decorated cups; I do not know to what use these latter were put. Possibly they were related to the idea of purification which the ancient world attached to them and were used to hold holy water. This is only an hypothesis. In connection with the allegory of the Resurrection, on Holy Saturday the medieval Church blessed the eggs which would be eaten by the faithful the next day, before any other food was taken; and this custom still exists in Rome. On Holy Saturday the priests “go to the houses of the families of their respective parishes to bless the rooms, the marriage bed, and the Easter eggs??.” The Romanians, Serbs, and Greeks still use Easter eggs which are blessed and painted red?*; those to be given to important personages are often elaborately decorated. This recalls the eggs offered by the Saracens to the Crusaders near
Damiette, when they released them from their prisons, which 228883



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
Joinville speaks of: “For the honor of our persons, they have
had the shells painted in diverse colors”? (Fig. 4).”
In Burgundy it is still the custom today to gather with
great care the eggs laid on Good Friday in order to eat them
on Easter Day, because of the legendary virtues with which
old traditions have endowed them. In the west of France, as
well as many other places in the world, Easter eggs are still
tinted in various colors and pastries are prepared with layers
of chopped meat and hard cooked eggs cut in circles. These
popular customs and many others share the same symbolism
and commemorate in their way Christ’s Resurrection.
The simultaneous blessing of the bedroom, the marriage
bed, and the Easter eggs by the Roman priests seems to bring
together the idea of resurrection with that of the propagation
of life through Christian marriage. Other customs could be
connected with this, for instance one that was still observed in
the nineteenth century by the young girls of the island of
Ushant when they wished to marry, and found it difficult be
cause so many of the young men of the island were away at
sea: on Easter day they took eggs to the church, placed them
in front of the altar during mass to be blessed, and then very
carefully carried them away again?®.

the revivified Person of the Savior, we could place the accursed eggs which European tradition attributed to demonism. In speaking of the basilisk I have already mentioned that legendary egg that the whole medieval period took seriously, whose shell, if we are to take the word of Vincent de Beauvais2’, is so hard as to be practically unbreakable, and which is sired by an old cock begotten in hell. The basilisk comes out of this egg. The country people have given this infernal product a very close relative. Everyone who has lived in the country has seen the little elongated eggs that are found in the farmyards at the beginning or end of a hen’s laying season, which contain only the egg white, without yolk or germinal disk. They are the result simply of an insufficiency in the hen of the matter that constitutes the egg; but in many country districts they are still attributed to roosters, or to “serpents” impregnated by roosters. These little eggs, considered as evil objects possibly containing the germ of the basilisk, were formerly thrown into a fire which was then put out with
holy water (Vendée, Deux-Sévres), so as to protect the farm- 228855

house from the evil effects that they might cause. They are
used in low forms of witchcraft, and are called by different
names depending on the province: cocatrie, cockatrice eggs,
eggs of the basilisk-cock, of the “Jau-vermine,” the “coco
diable” or the “coq-au-diable,” ete.2® And when a hen is un
lucky enough to imitate the cock’s crow at the moment when
one of these eggs appears, it is mercilessly put to death as the
herald of some misfortune.
There are also eggs dedicated to maleficent purposes in
tites of magic or sorcery, such as the owls’ eggs placed in an
cient tombs, with or without the corpses of the birds them
selves?°, and the eggs of snakes or toads which the country
sorcerers use in working their miserable spells (Fig. 5).
The mysterious “Egg of the World” of the Chaldeans, the
Egyptians, the Thracians, and the Greeks, which was repre
sented by the fossil sea-urchin among the Druids, will be spoken of in Part V.

WINGS AND FEATHERS
VERYWHERE IN ANCIENT times birds’ wings were used as
Fiaeoeans to express glory, beauty, sublimity, exaltation,
favor or help from on high that was hoped for or received,
and aspiration toward spiritual or philosophical heights. In the
spiritual or religious sense, “flight” was the picture of the soul
enamored of its highest ideal, appearing in this image as freed
from matter insofar as existence on this earth permits, like
the two wings of the “flight”’ which
have rid themselves of the weight of
the bird’s body! (Fig. 1). Thus un
burdened, it mounts ever upward and
finally soars in a luminous region of
serenity. This is why mysticism
makes the “flight”? the symbol of
prayer and contemplation.
In the sixth century, the pope St.
Gregory the Great presented thus
the symbolic role of the wings of the
four mysterious animals of the
Tetramorph: “An ingenious and pen
etrating description shows us these
four animals which the prophet’s spirit foresaw in the future:
each had four faces, each had four wings. What can the face
mean but knowledge; and what the wings, if not flight? It is
by the face that each person is known, and by the wings that

288



WINGS AND FEATHERS
birds lift themselves into the air. The face then refers to faith, the wing to contemplation, for by faith the almighty God knows us. By contemplation, which raises us above ourselves, we lift ourselves as it were into the air?.” During the Middle Ages, sculptors and painters sometimes endowed with wings the human images representing all the virtues, especially those of hope, charity, truth and truthfulness, evangelical poverty, and penitence?. But there are accursed wings which beat against the sides of the infernal animals, vampires, basilisks, dragons, and sometimes mermaids. In the fantastic picturings of such animals these wings are not formed of feathers, but of
a naked membrane, whose Fig. 2. The accursed wings: Death the destroyer (14th century).
appearance makes their evil character more evident. In Christian symbolism, wings of skin are connected with the idea of the perversion of the intellectual faculties, and of the uses to which these are put by those who study for evil purposes; for by such work—as with all mental exercise—they raise themselves above the ordinary level of humanity; not to those high regions of deep peace, but to those of the storm, to descend again scattering over the earth the seeds of confusion, trouble, discord, and perversity. These are the wings that Christian art sometimes gives to Death* (Fig. 2) and often to Satan. Sometimes demons are depicted as bats’. In general, birds’ wings provided the large feathers that had often a sacred connotation. In the iconography of Egypt, the ostrich feather was the hieroglyph of the goddess Maat, who was the personification of truth, sincerity, and justice, cosmic
equilibrium, hence law, and accordingly expressed these same a2oe89

ideas. This is why the judges, assessors for Osiris, at the tribunal of the dead, some
times wore a feather on their heads like
Maat herself. The disembodied soul also
sometimes wore the feather as a sign of sin
cerity and the rectitude of its actions during
life. In the theological concepts of Egypt,
Maat was the daughter of the sun, and
through this birthright, not the goddess of

from the divine sun and showing everything
in its absolute reality and truth. This is why
her emblem was an ostrich feather, pure white like a spotless ray of light (Fig. 3).
From the other side of the world, since time immemorial
the big feathers of raptors rather than of ostriches have al
ways been regarded as the symbolic representations of the
rays of the radiant sun, and the Incas of South America crowned their heads with them®. Among the Greeks and Romans, the birds’ largest feathers, the quills, symbolized speed, because they came from the wings of swift birds and because they equipped arrows for flight’. Since the time of the Caesars, this same big feather, the penna, sharpened like the old reed pen, served for writing. Although this use of it did not become general until about the fifth century, it was practiced already from the beginning of the second century, as we know from
the iconography of the columns of Trajan and Anthony. The
Word of God is known to us not only by speech but also by
what has been written, and this Word transmitted in writing j
has been represented by various symbolic objects, especially

the Evangelistary which contains the four narratives of the life of Christ. This latter is symbolized not by an open book, but by the scrinium containing four scrolls. To this must be added the stylus of metal or bone that was used to write on wax tablets, the reed pen or its bronze copy, and the sharpened quill of goose, swan, or peacock that was used for writing with ink. Christian iconography very soon put the reed pen and the quill in the hands of writers of sacred texts, evangelistic letter-writers, teachers, and all those whose writings made them venerated by the Church. After the medieval period, the quill became the typical symbol of the written word and those
who served it, and the professional emblem of all writers and scribes (Fig. 4).

THE FISH
T IS AN unquestionable fact that some two thousand years before our era, the cult of the fish, as the image of divinity
and hence identified with divinity itself, was established in Turan in Asia Minor, in India and the Far East, in Chaldea, Babylonia, Media, Susiana, Mesopotamia, Assyria, Persia,
Syro-Phoenicia, the Aegean region, Egypt, Libya, and Numidia; and crossing the ocean, we find its image again,
beautifully sculptured or carved, in the oldest monuments of
Mexico, as for instance Palenque. In the northernmost parts
of Europe, the water spirit, pictured at first in the form of a
fish, little by little was endowed with human intellectual faculties and became the dual being, half man and half fish, such as the god Dagon of the Philistines and the Phoenicians who is spoken of in the Bible!. In all the early civilizations of the old world of Europe and Asia, the fish was considered as the sign of human and animal fecundity; on one hand, because of the incredible number of
eggs that it carries—sometimes hundreds of thousands, according to the naturalists?—and on the other hand, because of the ancient belief that life originated in the depths of the sea. “In Sumerian thought,” says Delaporte, “all that has life comes from the watery principle?.” In these same parts of western Asia, for many centuries before the Christian era, sacred art chose and retained various other symbols besides the fish to represent this fecundity, notably the cones of the cedar and the pine; and with the fish 229955

was identified the god Oannes, who as
the Nordic water spirit was turned by the artists into a fish-man. He was tre- eg
garded as the Lord of the world and of all the lives it harbors, and as the media
tor between earth and sky*. Recent re
searches have all confirmed what the
Babylonian historian Berossus had al
ready said in the third century before our era’. Cylindrical seals from the above
mentioned regions, with which our Euro
pean museums are bountifully provided, often show Oannes or Anu, whether in
the guise of a fish placed on an altar or
perhaps swimming, or in the hybrid form — Fig: 1 The god Oannes;
between fish and human. In certain as- eaullare Tt Calach
pects he approximates the Logos of the Greeks, the eternal
Word. To celebrate his cult, the priests dressed themselves
and the images of the god in a cloak shaped like the split
body of a fish whose head crowned that of its wearer like a
miter or a helmet. An Oannes in this dress is pictured on one
of the doors of the Calach palace (Fig. 1). Among the Phoenicians and Philistines, Oannes took the name of Dagon, whose origin seems to
be Assyrian® and which “expresses simul
taneously the idea of the fish and of wheat’,” thus recalling the origin of life
L.
and its maintenance on earth (Fig. 2).
His temples of Gaza and of Azotus, or — Fig. 2 The god Dagon;
Ashdod, are often mentioned in the bas-relief from Khotsabad:
Bible, and it was to the latter that the Philistines conveyed the
Ark of the Covenant after their victory over Israel at Aphek®.

Phoenician influence®. Like Poseidon, Baal-Itan carries a
trident. Oannes, on the north and east of the Euphrates, and Dagon, on the west and south, were regarded as symbols of
male fertility, both human and animal. Their female counter
parts were Ishtar of Chaldea, and Astoreth or Atargatis of Syro-Phoenicia, who were sometimes represented as naked but chaste women and sometimes as half woman, half fish—like
the mermaids of a later date, whose artistic prototype they seem to have been.
It is difficult to imagine the extraordinary magnificence in
which the Eastern peoples clothed these cults. About two hundred years before the Christian era, the Greek Lucian wrote that the statue of Atargatis-Derceto in her temple at
Hierapolis was covered with gold and dazzling jewels of all colors, brought from Egypt, Ethiopia, Armenia, Phoenicia,
Media, and Babylonia!°. In the sacred fish pond adjoining her temple, the fish raised in her honor were themselves venerated
and came to eat out of the priests’ hands when they were
called. They wore corselets made of gold, and rich jewels sparkled in their gills, fins, and sometimes in their lips'!. These sacred fishponds are found in Asia to this day: at Saravane, in Indo-Chinese Laos, the Buddhist library is built on pilings over a pond “where the sacred fish swarm!2.”’ It might be remembered that the fish is the Hindu Matsya, the first avatar of Vishnu, at once the revealer and g unNG the savior). Chaldean mythology gives us a relative

formed of the forequarters of an antelope and the lower part of a fish. Ea, “lord of Apsu,”’ was the Chaldean god of wisdom, a powerful wisdom in accordance with the horns that crowned his head: he is seen thus on king Melishipak’s boundary-stone, carved about twelve hundred
years before Christ, which is now in the Louvre!* (Fig. 3). 2209%7



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
In the Egyptian Sudan, rites springing from fetishism are
still practised which connect the fish and the male sex organ;
while in Laos, where sacred fish are kept, young girls wear
around their necks, between gold and silver fish, metal orna
ments in the shape of the female organs. This same custom
can be found in some regions of China and several of the Pa
cific islands.
The old Chaldeo-Syrian myths of Oannes, Anu, or Dagon
may well have lent themselves to adoption by the early Chris
tians as a symbol of the Savior. We should remember that the
Apostle Peter, when he left Jerusalem, established his first
episcopal see in Antioch, in Syria, in the heart of Oannes’
kingdom, and a connection might well have been made be
tween Christ and the Syrian fish-god. And then one day it
happened that a Christian, thought to be an Al
exandrian Greek!?, perceived that by taking each
letter of the Greek word IXOYC, ichtus, “fish,”
as the initial of a word, a phrase could be ob
tained which read IHCOYC XPICTOC OHON
YIOC COTHP, “Jesus Christ, God’s son, Sav

Fig. 4 The Ichus and from there spread to all the areas of Chris
and the XP initials tendom where necessarily “the discipline of se
of Christ; on a
Phoenician tomb crecy” was in force; the fish’s shape or its name
were drawn or written everywhere, their meaning
a mystery which only Christians could under
stand, When Constantine was converted to Christianity and
made peace with the Church, he placed a sign on the imperial
standard which was composed of an X and a P super
imposed—the first letters of the Greek word XPICTOC,
Christ (Fig. 4), and it was sometimes shown supported by the
divine Fish!°.
Under Constantine’s successors, the old Roman empire
weakened and its frontiers were invaded everywhere by its
barbarian neighbors. The Goths, partially converted to the
Christian faith, brought with them an art that was rude and
at Cannes.

earthy, but full of life and rich with brilliant colors. And it was the merging of these new forms, little by little, with the old artistic traditions that brought forth, several centuries later, the marvelous French medieval art which remains the purest and richest expression of the Christian spirit and of its thought. Here again, from the end of the fifth century, we find the image of the sacred fish, brought by the Goths from the shores of the Black Sea, coming into favor once more throughout the valley of the Danube, Liguria, Emilia, and Gaul where it was especially popular. From there it entered Ireland where it became a_ Fig. 5 Al-Khiz, “The Holy One.” dominant symbol!” even as its use in From a painting in A.K.

In western Asia, Moslem or Hindu symbolic art shows the Saint, Al-Khizr or Kawaja-Khizr, with the figure of an aged man dressed in a green coat, carried on top of the water by a fish, which thus conveys him over the river of life!® (Fig. 5). I must at least make mention here of a strange trinitary symbol: three fishes exactly alike which are united in that their three heads form only one. It is a very ancient symbol that the Middle Ages preserved apparently without connecting it with the idea that would allow and explain the attribution of the fish symbol, usually reserved for the Son, to the Father and the Holy Ghost. I reproduce this symbol here, taken from a twelfth century keystone in the Benedictine Abbey of Luxeuil (Fig. 6). Under the name of Trinacria, the heraldry of the nobility preserved this figure on rare coats-of-arms such as that of Die Hunder, of Franconia!®. Gevaert’s recent treatise on heraldry recognizes it as one of the symbols of the

Holy Trinity2°. It seems to affirm the identity of the divine
nature, common to all three Persons by the similarity of the
three fishes, as the unity of their substance is attested by the
single head which makes all three into one being. Like the Swastika, the Trinacria is a figure with an imagined central pivot which essentially expresses the turning movement which
animates everything, which engages everything, and which is
at the point of origin of all life. And in this sense, the Tri
nacria symbolizes the continual creative action of the three di
vine Persons that is expressed by the holy Word of whom St.
John says that “All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made?!.” The first Christians called themselves “sons of the celestial
Ichtus,” the Great Fish which they must follow and imitate in everything: “We, small fish,” wrote Tertullian in the second
century, “like our Fish, Jesus Christ, swim in the (baptismal)
water, and we can be saved only by remaining in it??.” And in
the following century, St. Cyprian expressed himself ‘thus: “It is in the water that we are reborn, in the likeness of Christ,
our Master, the Fish.’’ The artists who were contemporaries
of these two doctors of the church illustrated this allegory in 300

a thousand ways; one of the most beautiful examples is the great mosaic medallion in the catacomb of Hadrumetum, at Susa, in Tunisia; it shows the Christ-Fish, lying on the anchor, the hermetic image of the cross of Calvary, and all around it, smaller fish, representing the faithful, swim peacefully among the seaweeds. Long before the birth of Christ, some Asian cults celebrated the mysteries of the divine fish, with special rites, in which the fish is sacrificed and solemnly consumed as food. This cult is attested by monuments in Syria, Mesopotamia, Assyria, and Chaldea. A bas-relief of Nimrod placed beneath the Ilu image, the symbol of Assyria’s chief god, shows the sacrificed fish placed at the foot of the altar, under the lunar crescent and the star of Ishtar, goddess of love and fertility. On one side is Oannes, or a priest identified with him, and on the other a winged personage—perhaps the sacrificer, Fig. 7 Assyrian ritual meal; as behind him we see an unsheathed sword. from 4 carved cylinder And on a carved stone now in the British “Pris? Museum Museum (Fig. 7), we see the fish laid on the altar, again with the star and crescent moon above. Seated on either side for the ritual meal are a man whose head seems to be in contact with the symbol of Ilu, and a woman who like the man opposite her lifts a bowl to her lips. A third personage, holding an indefinable object, seems to be taking part in the ceremony. And in both these carvings?3, even if there is no relation with the subject we are discussing, we cannot help noting the seven mysterious globes. Ceremonies analogous to those of Egypt, Assyria, and Chaldea in which the ritual consumption of the fish was the essential act, were practiced also in Asia Minor and, it is believed, in Cyprus. All had the same intention: the intimate union of the purified human being with the divinity, by the in
gestion of the flesh of the sacred fish—as if it were an actual 330011



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
participation in its nature and qualities. The Roman conquests
and the Pax Romana spread the knowledge of the fish-god’s
liturgies through the whole immense empire of the Caesars, as
it did those of Athys and Mithra also, on the eve of the ap
pearance of the Eucharist as the hearth of spiritual life in the
new religion of Christianity.
Salomon Reinach says: “Surely no reasonable person will
try to find the origin of Christianity in the sacrificial cult of
the fish, but this cult did exist in Syria well before Chris
tianity, and it is an historical certainty that we find it again
there as we find survivals of two other zoomorphic cults, those
of the dove and the lamb24.” The possibility remains that
these last echoes of the sacrificial rites of the symbolic fish
and of the cults of Oannes, Dagon, and Ea had some influ
ence on the choice of the fish as the symbol of the Redeemer
and of the Eucharist. Because of this eucharistic significance, the first Christian artists de
picted the fish in numerous, very
clear ways. Sometimes above the Fig. 8 The fish carrying the chalice or on the altar, it seems to

other occasions it waits on a platter, between the chalice and

banquet scenes are numerous in the paintings in the Roman
catacombs, and the presence of the symbolic fish is very prob
ably an allusion to the meal that Jesus shared after his Resur
rection with seven of his disciples who were fishing on the
shores of Lake Tiberias. When they approached, St. John
says, they saw on the shore a fish placed over live coals with
bread beside it, and Jesus said to them: “Come and dine,”
and he took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish
also2>. _It seems certain that this gospel text contributed *302

greatly to the eucharistic significance given the fish, for this episode of the seven favored disciples was the most popular of all the mystic banquets in early Christian art. There are two fishes in the Roman catacomb of St. Calistus, one of which carries in its mouth the eucharistic bread, and the other the grape (Fig. 9). Sometimes the bread carried thus by a fish is contrasted with the fatal fruit of Eden, which has the same globular shape. On a bronze lamp, a dolphin carries the “living bread” and a griffin, symbolizing the Evil Spirit, holds in its beak the cursed fruit. It is the duel between Christ, the “New Adam,” and the infernal spirit who caused the old Adam to sin, a duel symbolized by the opposition of

Christ, in Christian symbolism the fish sometimes stood for the Evil Angel, Satan. It is chiefly the Book of Job, designating the monstrous king of the sea as Leviathan, who “maketh the deep to boil like a pot?7,” that has inspired the fish images that are often seen in medieval stained glass. On the other hand, in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris, we see angels with swords attacking the infernal fish (Fig. 11), accom- 330033

THE DOLPHIN
MONG VARIOUS OTHER kinds of sea creatures, it was
notably the dolphin that was taken as the emblem of
Christ; but in pre-Christian times its use as a symbol was not
as widespread as that of the anonymous fish. The use of the
dolphin’s image began and developed on the northeast shores
of the Mediterranean and around the Black Sea, especially in
Asia Minor, Greece, and Italy. Navigators of these countries
regarded the dolphin as an animal of good omen and a benev
olent traveling companion; it came to be called “the sailor's
friend.” Marvelous qualities of intelligence, almost of divina
tion, of physical skill and of devotion were attributed to it, as
well as wonderful feats of life-saving. The legend of Arion is
well known—the gifted lyre player who was thrown overboard
by his jealous companions and received by the dolphins who
carried him safe and sound to the coast of Lycaonia!. It is
said that the fishermen and sailors of those times considered it
a crime against the laws of friendship to keep any dolphins
that by chance became entangled in their nets, and carefully freed them and let them go. This respect for the friendly sea animal explains the thou
sands of pre-Christian images of it on all sorts of monuments
and art objects. But in primitive Christian art, in Rome at
least, although the image of the fish in its generalized form
had long been common in the iconography of the Savior, the
dolphin did not appear till the end of the second century or
the beginning of the third, when it began to be used to spe- 306

The mystics found here the very image of Christ coming to the rescue of the soul especially in the dark hours of life and the shadows of death. Perhaps it was in this connection that Christianity accepted the relation of the dolphin with the cult of light, which was affirmed by a very ancient symbolism whose origin seems to be lost, but which the Ancients thought came from the mysterious regions of the North?.

Between its clenched jaws the divine Fish crushes the head of the octopus. I think there can be no doubt that this is the victory of Christ over Satan. Here the dolphin’s symbolism joins that of the eagle, the 330077

Christian iconography presents as victorious enemies of the
serpent; and Dom Leclercq cites an example, taken from
Rossi, of an antique seal embellished with a dolphin devouring
a serpent’.
Since the Renaissance, the symbolic dolphin appears rather
rarely in religious art, except in ecclesiastical heraldry which
has presented it several times in the course of the last two centuries®.

THE SEA URCHIN
N THE TWELFTH century in the castles of France, the
Tinetts of fossilized sea urchins brought back from Palestine
by the Crusaders were reverently collected. Special qualities
were attributed to them and they were called “Stones of Ju
dea!.” Those better-informed in hermetism saw in the sea
urchin the symbolic image of the earth’s northern hemisphere,
the only region known by the Ancients—the lines of dots de
scending from the top over the whole of the shell’s surface
were taken as meridians coming down from the pole, and the
base represented the equator; two shells placed bottom to
bottom thus formed a model of the whole terrestrial globe. More commonly, the sea urchin, whether living or fossilized,
was looked upon as the symbol of rebirth after death. It is
probably in this context that ancient Freemasonry took the
theme of the sea urchin as “emblem of death and resurrec
tion,” as reformulated by René Guénon from one of the oldest Masonic books?.
In France as in other western countries the fossil sea
urchin is still the subject of widely differing superstitions. In
the south, low forms of sorcery have taken possession of it,
and in England it is still “one of the fetishes of white magic?”
when considered as “the snake’s egg.” At Chamaliéres, in
Auvergne, for instance, it is still regarded and venerated as a bringer of good luck.
An old legend from the north of France says that when the
Virgin was baking bread in Nazareth, the child Jesus amused 330099

himself by shaping the dough into little rolls which he deco
rated with dots and gave to his playmates. Those that
remained he multiplied to an infinite number and the angels
carried them away to scatter in the countries where later the
priests of Christ would change his own body into bread.
It may have been in Gaul, or a little further east, that the
idea arose of the fossil sea urchin as a symbol of the “Egg of
the World,” as the Ancients called it, the ovum anguinum
(snake’s egg) of the Druids. “I have had the opportunity of
seeing one of these (serpent’s) eggs,” wrote Pliny; “it was the
shape and size of a small apple; its surface, cartilaginous and
pitted with holes, resembled a polypary*.” This could only be a sea urchin?.
Nineteenth-century archeology was not mistaken in equat
ing the sea urchin shells found in several pre-Christian Gallic
burials with the ovum anguinum of the Druids, symbolizing the
Egg of the World, thus the life of the world and its renewal. The sea urchin appears in some pre-Roman
tombs in very special circum
stances. In 1899 I myself with
some companions dug up a tomb in Deux-Sévres, still partly surrounded by a circular mound twenty meters across, which conFig.1. Symbolic sea urchin from the tained nothing but a little stone

other instances: A Breton tomb excavated by M. du Chatellier
contained nothing but a fossil sea urchin, like a Neolithic
tomb in Charente-Inférieure, and others; in one case the shell
was accompanied by two beautiful bronze bracelets. It is gen
erally thought that these funeral mounds empty of any occu
pant are cenotaphs commemorating the dead whose bodies
could not be found.
Some scholars claim that well before the Druidic period, 310



THE SEA URCHIN
people of the Neolithic age or their immediate successors symbolically depicted the serpent and the egg by the align
ment of menhirs such as those of Avebury in England and of
Carnac in French Brittany. Their cromlechs or sacred circles
of stones, symbolizing the Egg of the World, would thus de
lineate “the constellation of the Dragon, the Mount of Saint
Michael representing the pole of the heavenly equator®.” If
this theory were accepted it would lend authority to the claims of other lithic sites in France, Scotland, and even
North Africa to be seen as symbols of the Egg of the World.
It seems probable that the first idea of this symbolic egg
arose in the countries where human beings first learned exact
notions of the great astronomical laws—Chaldea, Susiana,
Bactriana... Long before our era the pattern of many of the
stars’ paths was known there, and the Zodiac had been cre
ated. At its origin, the Egg of the World would only have
been the space defined by the elliptical movement of the
earth’s rotation around the sun’, and thus the compass of the vivifying action of the sun on our planet. As it passed farther from its source, this first idea of the
World Egg was soon wrapped in a cloud of fantastic interpre
tations which have often made it unrecognizable; but in spite
of this, it can be found even today in the far corners of the
earth. The Buddhist priests say that before time began, the
world was enclosed in a mysterious egg which floated on the
surface of the waters, and when it broke open, the world
emerged from the night of nothingness. In the ancient cos
mography of Japan, Chaos was represented by the lunar Bull
who broke with his horn the golden egg from which the world
emerged’, The Hindu Egg of the World, the Brahmanda, was
contained in the primordial waters and hatched by the myste
tious swan who was the vehicle of Brahma, the golden Embryo®. The orientalist René Guénon says that it is by the
operation of the universal spirit, Atma, that the celestial ray of
the uncreated germ is projected which will act upon the potential Universe, the Brahmanda or World Egg!®. Some orien- 331111

talists connect the black-and-white symbol of the yin-yang with
the emergence of the World Egg from primordial chaos,
when, in the words of Genesis, day and night were
separated!!,
The Mazdeans of Persia also knew of a divine egg, con
nected with the creative action of Ahura Mazda; and in the
iconography of the ancient Assyrians, the Egg of the World,
appearing more often in a globular than an oval form, was at
tached to the idea of the propagation of life within the bounds
of the sun’s action, as it was also with the Syro-Phoenicians.
For the Egyptians, the concept of the World Egg represented
their idea of the entry of life into the created world, and they
also gave it the globular form (Fig. 2). Creation of the Egg
was sometimes attributed to Ptah, the father of life, and
sometimes to Khnum, who was also said to give birth to the
Egg through his mouth, which according to Guénon connects
it with the symbolism of the Word!?. Also, it is the function
of Heget, the frog-headed goddess, symbol of the embryonic
state!?, who holds in her hand the key of life, the Ankh, “to
give birth perpetually to the Egg of the World, which the
male god Khnum perpetually fashions and shapes. She is the
goddess of birth and rebirth'* (Fig. 3\f

THE SEA URCHIN
Fig. 4 Underside of sea urchin, showing the pentagonal mouth,
also of resurrection and the future life, and moreover of its
production by the Word of the divinity—whether of the cre
ator god or of his serpent!>—brings us back to the symbolism of Christianity. The Mediterranean Albigenses of the
twelfth century, affiliated with Manichaeism, who preserved the Christian symbols of the fish, the vase, and the dove, saw
also in the living sea urchin an emblem of the Word made man: the body unseen within the shell showed the hidden divinity of Christ, the shell his human covering, and the long spines which cover the whole, like arrows all pointing out
wards, signify the spreading of his word throughout the world. In the living sea urchin, the large pentagonal opening on the bottom of the shell corresponds to a mouth, placed at the
creature’s center (Fig. 4). It is equipped with five sharp teeth
and is proportionally larger than that of nearly any other animal. Perhaps the great attention given by Catharist symbolism to
the pentagonal shape manifested by the lines on the surface of
the sea urchin’s shell as well as by the mouth opening might 331133



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
be a distant reflection, an obscure survival of Celtic ideas. In
any case it evokes strangely the starry pentagon of
Pythagoras, the most mysterious symbol of his teaching, the
“Pentagram.” It may be too bold to suggest that Pythagoras
might have lent his Pentagram to the Druidic interpretation of
the sacred ovum anguinum of the Gauls, with which he must
assuredly have been acquainted.

THE BEE AND THE FLY
INCE THE WORLD was young, human beings everywhere have looked upon the honeybee as one of God’s gifts; in every language, poets have sung praise for its wisdom, its activity, its consummate industry. The oldest testimony we have of the relationship between the human be (7?——7—""J ing and the bee is painted on the wall of a prehistoric cave in Spain, the “Cueva de la Arafia.” This painting probably dates from the Magdalenian epoch, the earliest era of human life. It shows two people o hunting for honey who, with the help of $ < three supporting ropes, are robbing a r ‘ swarm of bees on the face of a sheer ‘ % cliff! (Fig. 1). Long after this, in the oldest hieroglyphs in Egypt, a honeybee appears in an essentially symbolic form, designating the pharaoh, who is represented by the double image of bee and reed, giving the meaning of: “Lord of Upper and Lower Egypt” (Fig. 2). A funerary hymn to the pharaoh Senwosret (Usertsen or Sesostris) III is expressed like this: “You have married the reed to cEL the bee,” which means that he ruled over Fig 7 Prehistoric painting the two lands of Egypt. in the Cueva de la Araiia. 331199



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
In this same civilization, the bee symbolized the human soul; as we shall see a little later on, it J is found again with this meaning
in tombs as the sign of human
ity’s hope, and of the soul’s sur
£\ vival after death. This is probably
also the idea behind the design of
Fig. 2 Pharaonic bee from the stele of an Egyptian necklace made of
Amenenhet IIT in the Egyptian gold beads, now belonging to the
gallery of the Musée Guimet. Museum of St. Germain,
The oldest Egyptian symbolists were able to make such
good use of the bee’s qualities because their contemporaries
were the first civilized people to practice beekeeping in a me
thodical way. In the upper valley of the Nile, hives placed on
boats floated down the river to lower Egypt, thus taking ad
vantage of a succession of blossomings’. There is an immense
distance between such well-arranged conditions and the occa
sional, chance scavenging of wild honey.
In Crete, the supreme god, born of the Earth Mother
(Demeter-Ceres), was said to have been brought up in a cave
by a Cretan princess on Amaltheia’s milk and the honey of the
queen bee Melissa; a coin from Praisos bears on one side the
head of Demeter and on the other is a honeybee, the goddess
Melissa? (Greek meli, honey). The cult of the honeybee
spread very quickly from Crete through the Aegean islands
and mainland Greece®, and its traces can be seen in the ar
cheological remains of the cities of Eleusis, Corinth, Miletus,
Samothrace, and especially Ephesus and several other large
Hellenic towns®. Even today, the honeybee is venerated with
more or less superstition in the islands of Thasos and Athos
and in Chalcidice, whose honeys are worthy of the poetic rep
utation of the honey of Hymettus; “bee-weed,” the sweet
smelling melissa plant, is abundant in these regions.
At Eleusis and at Ephesus, the priestesses who in former
times celebrated the ancient mysteries were called Melissai, 320



THE BEE AND THE FLY
“the Honeybees,”’ and certain initiates who had obtained an unquestioned degree of purity were given the same name. The bee was thought to be endowed with divine gifts of astonishing and mysterious powers, and this belief was taught to the candidates for initiation in the inner circles of Samothrace, another religious center where the bee was revered’. Doubtless it is in connection with the liturgical and initiatic role played in the religious celebrations in Greece by the bee and its honey and wax that it enters as chief decorative motif into such pieces of jewelry as the metal bee-clasps mentioned by Reinach® (Fig. 3) that were found in excavations at Ephesus by English archeologists, and which recall the golden cicadas which fastened the hair of the devotees of Hera in the temple of Samos’. Get At Camirus, at Miletus, at Delos, Fig. 3 Ephesian bee clasp, Thera, and Melos, plaquettes of gold have taken from Reinach, been found representing the Melissa godRépertoire. dess whose human torso is similar to that of Diana, the Persian Artemis, and whose lower body is that of a bee. The connection between the insect and the Latin Diana recalls not only the bee coins of Ephesus but also the passage in the Acts of the Apostles which describes St. Paul’s visit to that city and the reverent regard there for the cult of “the great Diana of the Ephesians!°.” This same regard extended from Lebanon to the extreme limits of Assyria, Medea, Susiana, and Babylonia. Only the Hebrews, although they valued honey very highly, took exception to the insect that produced it. From the Caucasus to modern Hungary, numerous barbaric examples of jewelry in the form of the bee from the first centuries of our era prove that it was venerated in all these regions}. Among the Romans, who were so strongly influenced by Greek ideas, honeybees were also greatly valued, and Virgil honored them with a beautiful song which is a veritable man
ual of ancient apiculture and at the same time a tribute of 332211



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
sincere admiration!2, although his contemporaries and com
patriots sometimes regarded bees and the passage of their
swarms as presages of ill fortune!?. Among the Gauls also,
the hard-working insect played an important part in their
most ancient customs; hydromel, or honey water, (the basis of
mead before it ferments), was their celebratory drink, and
honeyed wine their stimulant. The bee also took part in the
metaphysical symbolism of the Druids.
Even today, this symbolism is a living fact in Asia and also
among the western Catholics. The Mazdeans maintain the
early Persian belief that honey was a component part of the
heavenly soma which intoxicated the divine beings, and among
the Hindus, Krishna and Vishnu were likened to active honey
bees; the latter is sometimes represented by the figure of a
bee poised on alotus leaf, and Krishna wears a blue bee on his forehead".
As I have said, the presence of bee symbols in ancient
tombs seems to be related to the idea of the soul’s survival af
ter death. Even today, popular tradition in France, like that of
all the Ancients, places the honeybee among the springtime
signs of the Resurrection and sometimes associates it also with
bereavements in the family. Bee symbols were found in the fu
nerary treasure of Queen Ah-hotep I, which was taken to the
museum at Gizeh.
Probably the same meaning should be recognized in the bee
symbols found in the barbaric burials of the Gauls, whether
Christian or not. In the tomb of the Frankish king Childeric,
who died in 481, there were several hundred images of honey
bees, made of garnets set in gold (Fig. 4). Tombs of approx
imately the same date in the districts of Aisne, Somme, and
Lyons contained similar jewels.
Honey was also related to the human hope of another life
that would be eternally happy, and was offered whenever pos
sible to the spirits of the dead. The old historians Herodotus
and Strabo inform us that in Assyria, the bodies of important
people were buried in honey after having been coated with 322

wax. This recalls the fable of Glaucus, the son of Minos and Pasiphaé, who after falling dead into a vat of honey came to life again when his lips touched this miraculous substance!>. (The intervention of Aesculapius and his serpent which is sometimes applied to this tale is thought to be a later addition.) From all these facts, modern archeologists are obliged to conclude, with Cook and Reinach, that among the Ancients the bee certainly represented the soul’s survival “and another, limitless existence!®.” Christian symbolism, following that of the Ancients, accepted the bee as one of the emblems of resurrection and immortality. The reason for this was the same as with the butterfly, the swallow in the West, and the frog in Egypt. The honeybee disappears during the winter season and reappears in spring; and since for ancient symbolism, as we have already noted, a season lasts for three months, these three symbolic months are translated as the three days during which the body of Christ was hidden in the tomb, after which it reappeared as does the bee after its three months in the darkness of the hive. And this is exactly how our country people in France think of it to this day!”. The Bulletin of the Grand Lodge of Iowa, after several successive articles on the subject, came to the conclusion that the symbolic ideas of order, industry, and charity still associated with the honeybee are of fairly recent origin, and that in the 332233



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
past it was above all the emblem of resurrection and
immortality!®.
Long before Plato uttered his inspired praise of the divine
Word, the sacred Logos, the honeybee was in all likelihood al
ready the emblem of human eloquence and the power that it
can exert upon mankind. The Greeks, charmed by the magic
of the spoken word and the sound of the human voice, com
pared their greatest orators and singers to the bees who by
the work of their mouths produce delicious and strengthening
honey; and also another honey, spoken of by Xenophon,
Horace, and Pliny!?, which after a moment begins to trouble
the hearer’s thought and to keep it in confusion. Pertaining to
the first of these two kinds of honey, that is, to wise and vir
tuous eloquence, are the fables telling how the bees of Thrace
died all at once at the moment when the heart of the inspired
singer Orpheus ceased to beat; also how the bees of
Hymettus put drops of honey on the lips of the child Plato as
he slept, and fed with their finest nectar the baby who was the
future poet Pindar?°. This legend was later transposed in The
Golden Legend to apply to one of the most eloquent of the
Christian pontiffs, St. Ambrose, the illustrious bishop of
Milan: as a sleeping baby, it was said, the bees came to him
and one by one entered his mouth and from there shot sky
ward like arrows. Seeing this, his father cried, “Blessed be the
Lord! My son shall be holy before him and great in the com
pany of men2!.” Among the Hebrews, the bee was related to
the idea of language because of its name, dbure, and the
Hebraic root dbr which means word or speech”. In the Ori
ent, the Hindus dedicated the bee to the cult of the divine
Word, Bhagavat, represented as within a white tent, robed in
yellow and girdled with a rope of sweet-smelling flowers which
the bees are busily plundering??.
Virgil declared that “in bees there is a particle of the di
vine intelligence2+.” These words and others with which Virgil
paid homage to the bee have supported a number of symbol
ists in their comparisons between the ceaseless spiritual ac
324



THE BEE AND THE FLY
tivity of Christ in his church and the vivifying role of the mother bee in the hive. The comparison is made even more telling by the fact that Virgil, like Aristotle?> and all the other ancient writers, never speaks of the “queen” bee but of the “king of the bees?®,” recognizing that the entire swarm owes its existence to her, that she is the center of their attention, and that the order and peace of the hive are her work. By the very fact that she protects the hive, and that in it she finds the necessary conditions for her life-work of caring for the brood-comb and producing honey, the hive has been taken as the apt ideogram of a community life that is wisely ruled, peaceful, and fruitful, under the governance of one single head. The pre-Christian centuries understood this analogy, especially in Greece where, as for instance at Delphi and Ephesus, the priests and priestesses were called “bees” and their community was known as hyron, the hive. In medieval France, for the same reason, some big monasteries took a name derived from the life of the bees (French abeilles), such as the Cistercian abbey of Melleray, at the Meilleraie-deBretagne, in the diocese of Nantes, whose armorial bearings are still “of azure with a silver hive, accompanied by three bees of the same?” (Fig. 5).” The Church, also, whose head is the pope, has been allegorically likened to the hive: within its shelter, the care and the authority of the supreme pontiff must preserve the sacred teaching which is symbolized by honey, and set forth the discipline which gives each one his place in the Christian society. . In the same way that it represents the spiritual sense of the monastery and of the Church, quite naturally it also repre

THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
sents the human family; and by extension, the ancient symbolists and all their successors have taken it as the natural representation of nations and powers”® where, as in the hive, there is one sole chief of state in command and responsible for its welfare, like the pope in the Church’s government and the emperor or king in a monarchic state. From this single head, as
from the queen bee, derives the social life and order which
constitutes the nation’s prosperity. In this symbolic sense, her
aldry has made bees represent the subjects who owe their sov
ereign the same obedience that is rendered to the queen
mother in the hive2°. In this traditional mode, honeybees and their hive symbolize the social virtues that make nations great:
respect for authority, submission to law, honest hard work,
economy, and justice. This is undoubtedly what is meant to be
expressed by the bee harvesting a flower on one of the most
beautiful modern Italian coins, from the reign of Victor Em
manuel III. The thirteenth-century writer Thomas de Can
timpré, inspired by Albertus Magnus?°, compared the hive with the Christian city*!. The bees’ life in the hive, and their wonderful relations with their queen and with each other, have naturally come to represent wisdom, order, and agreement; their industry and the
valor with which they defend their hive and their honey have
made them perfect symbols of activity, courage, and self
sacrifice. The ancient authors saw in them also the represen
tation of justice, and in this were followed by the medieval
symbolists, who at the same time made them emblems of
Christ as judge32. In the profane sense, in medieval heraldry
the life of the bee represented forethought, because their
summer’s work ensures provisions for the winter??. But the
virtue exemplified most particularly by the bee is that of chas
tity. Virgil has sung more beautifully than any other ancient
writer of the pure life of the bees “who do not abandon them
selves to love nor weaken themselves with pleasures, and know
not either the union of the sexes nor the labor of giving
birth34.” Plutarch goes further and assures us that bees be- 326



THE BEE AND THE FLY
come angry if a man approaches them directly from a woman's bed?>, and will aim their stings at libertines?°. These statements at least show what a reputation for chastity the honeybee held in ancient thought. In medieval heraldry of the nobility, it was taken as the image of moral purity: Vulson de la Colombiére, echoing in 1669 the old French heraldists, said of the bees that “they denote chastity and virginity, from which it comes that their wax is offered to God as something very pure?”.” Whence comes the strange belief that certain bee-swarms, instead of emerging from an overpopulated hive, are born from the rotting bodies of animals sacrificed to the divinity? It is a very old notion and seems to be connected with the ancient Egyptian mysteries. With every appearance of probability, Alexandre Moret relates to the rites of Isis one which
is said to consist in bringing about the spontaneous formation of bees in the skin of a sacrificed bull; and he sees in this a sign of resurrection symbolized by the flight of the new swarm?®, This corresponds to what I have said before about the pre-Christian origins of the role formerly attributed to the honeybee as an emblem of resurrection. For others, this image is simply that of the initiate who, wholly dedicated to the pursuit of duty and goodness, produces thereby for himself and for others fruitful virtues which will go on exerting their beneficent action after his death. Virgil describes the process, in his time, in Egypt near Canopus, of the sacrifice of a two-year-old bull which was to give birth to the sacred swarm: it was killed, he said, by successive blows, without the letting of blood; then it was enclosed in a little roofed building just big enough to hold it. This little temple had four windows open to the four winds. The victim’s body was laid on planks of aromatic wood. “Soon the flesh of the animal’s body begins to heat and to ferment, and surprisingly, a cloud of insects is seen to emerge from it, first crawling, then vibrating their wings, then growing gradually strong enough to launch into the air, and finally taking 332277



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
flight with a great noise like a heavy summer rain, or like the
hail of arrows let loose by the Parthian as a signal of war??.”
This bloodless sacrifice of the bull was made in the spring
“before the coming of the swallows,” Virgil says, “before the
meadows ate adorned with new flowers.” Again, the bees born
of this death belong to the symbolism of the soul’s survival af
ter death.
The ancient Jews were suspicious of honey because of these
practices which the Syrians and other neighbors must have
copied from the Egyptians. The Alexandrian Philo Judaeus, a
contemporary of Jesus Christ, wrote that according to the law
“the Eucharistic bread must be without leavening and without
honey, not wishing that either substance be brought to the al
tar: the honey perhaps because the bee that makes it is a
filthy creature, said to be engendered in the rotting flesh of
cattle, as wasps and bumblebees are from the bodies of
horses. . . 40”
The Bible does not say that the bees of the swarm that
Samson found in the lion’s carcass were formed in its body,
nor does it call impure the honey he gathered from it and
which he presents as a symbol of sweetness and comfort born
from strength: “Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of
the strong came forth sweetness*!.”
Moret says that the idea that souls sometimes took the
form of bees and emerged through the skin of the dead being
was familiar to the Egyptians, and Rudolf Steiner praises the
Greek concept which compares the soul to a bee: “like the
bee which leaves the hive and gathers the nectar of flowers to
make it into honey, the soul coming forth from God enters
the world and gathers the nectar to take it back to the spirit’s
home42.” Four centuries before Steiner, St. Francis de Sales
also compared souls to bees during their earthly sojourn, al
luding to Samson's lion*?. La Vigne mystique, attributed to St.
Bernard, the twelfth century “doctor with the honeyed
tongue,” says that bees “are an image of souls which can and
knaw how to lift themselves on the wings of contemplation.” 328



THE BEE AND THE FLY
From one century to another, Christian spirituality has seen in the bee the allegorical image of the person who works in every worldly season to gather merits for another life, as the bee during the summer collects the honey that will nourish the colony during the winter. In the popular traditions of several European countries, there are legends which say that the souls of dead family members that have not yet found grace before God sometimes come to take shelter in the hives belonging to their descendants; this doubtless is why “the countryman of Vendée still associates the hive with deaths in his family**.” In certain undeveloped countries, the bee is simply the good spirit which protects the human being’s existence. Among the Eskimos, for example, a live bee is rolled over the bare shoulders of a woman about to have a child, in order to ease the birth. This bee fetish is carefully saved and given later to the child as a powerful amulet to protect its life*>. In spite of what certain authors have written, the dipterous
insect which one sometimes sees represented in connection
with sorcery or directly with demonism is not the bee, nor is it the wasp or the bumblebee, but the fly: not, to be more precise, the bothersome little house fly, but the blowfly, which includes several different species. With its deplorable reputation in the symbolism of the Ancients, in that of Christianity the blowfly has always been regarded as the antithesis of the honeybee. The bee hardly ever alights except on the blooming cups of flowers, and lives continually in a perfumed atmosphere; it uses only the purest nectar and pollen for its nourishment and for making its honey and wax. Its brood-comb is born and grows in sweet-smelling compartments; everything about it is pure, beautiful, and admirable. The blowfly, on the contrary, crawls about on dung and lives habitually among the most nauseating smells; it spoils clean things with the deposit of its eggs, and feeds on poisonous substances fermented in rotting flesh; its larvae hatch and develop in corruption;
everything about it is filthy and repulsive. The Middle 332299



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
Ages made it the symbol of the base in
stincts in that class of people that can be
called “the scum of the earth” which
lives in shame, and in ascetic symbolism
it is the image of carnal desires.
Throughout the Christian era it has been
considered one of the emblems of lewd
ness. Popular heraldry in its turn
adopted it to represent “importunity and
effrontery,” because it alights with equal
impudence “on a king’s brow and on the bosom of a queen*®.”
Ancient demonology has always placed
a blowfly, symbolizing a demon, near the
ear of a Christian who is undergoing
temptation. Two infernal entities (who in
fact are the same), Asmodeus and
Beelzebub, have been represented by the
symbolic fly: Beelzebub, who is called in
Fig, 6 I8th-century hermetic the Gospel “the prince of devils,” and
image of Asmodeus, 3 ‘
ihe dain of iii. which demonology designates with the
name “lord of the flies’; Asmodeus
whom the Talmud also names “the prince of devils,” and
whom demonology terms “the spirit of impurity.”
Even in glacial regions, flies represent evil spirits: “The
Lapps claim that their sorcerers keep ‘miraculous flies,’ that
is, malevolent spirits*”.”
The copy of a drawing in a sixteenth- or seventeenth
century manuscript, among the papers of the Abbé Leriche,
the author of several works on diabolic possession, symbolizes
Asmodeus by the skull of a goat; the animal’s horns end in
darts which, if one can rely on the language of asceticism,
must represent the “prickings of the flesh”; between the horns
is the fly of carnal desires*® (Fig. 6).
Beelzebub appears in the Gospels in the scene where the
Pharisees accuse Jesus of being possessed by this demon: he 3330



THE BEE AND THE FLY
casts out devils, they say, through the prince of devils#?. The name Beelzebub has been translated as “Lord of the Flies,” and as such, under the name Myode, he was honored in preChristian Rome and invoked against the attacks of flies of all kinds. The commonly accepted translation of the name Beelzebub as “Lord of the Flies” is not, however, indisputably correct. In his study of Arad-Hiba, the governor of Jerusalem, M. J. Halévy, has shown that according to the evidence of tablets found at Tel el-Amarna, there existed in Palestine an ancient village called Zebub; Beelzebub, or Baal-Zebub, might be the local god, the Baal, or Bel, of the town of Zebub>°. But the popular association “Lord of the Flies” persisted in numerous tales of diabolic possession. In 1630, at Limoges, it is said that after the hanging of a sorcerer, there emerged from his body “a demon in the form of a huge green fly ... that passed whistling over the gallows drawing a long trail of smoke behind it?!.” In 1663, during her trial as a witch, Catherine Ebermann was constantly harassed by flies?? and her judges came to the conclusion that she was being visited by “her Beelzebub,” the king of the flies>?. Gnats and the common small fly have always been taken as signs of something valueless and without duration. Human life, even if it attains the centenary, is ephemeral in the context of the infinity of time, and is often represented by the image of a fly which lives only for a single season or perhaps a single day, and is swept out of existence by a trifle. Between the two infinities of the past and the future, human life is only a moment and the soul is an eagle which ought not to waste its energy in futile things. “The eagle does not catch flies,” says an heraldic device: Aquila non capit muscas?*.

THE SCARAB AND
THE SCORPION
HE SACRED SCARAB of the Egyptians is at the head of an
important family of insects among the numerous species
of the coleoptera. Beetles are squat, awkward creatures with
out any claim to elegance. The kind venerated by the Egyp
tians (scarabeus sacer, Ateuchus Aegyptorium) is big and dark
colored with metallic glints; the body is
divided in three parts—head, corselet,
and abdomen which is protected by two
solid, horny wing-sheaths covering the
delicate wings. These insects live in
dung which they consume, and their
bodies secrete an oily substance that
prevents filth from sticking to them. In
_ Fig.1 The scarab pushing spring, they mould a ball of ordure in
its ball backwards; from Fabre, t ‘ : 3
which they place their eggs, in which
La Vie des Insectes,
in Souvenirs Entomologiste. the larvae find nourishment from the
moment of birth. “The scarab,” says
Horapollo, “buries its ball in the earth where it remains hid
den for twenty-eight days, a period of time equal to that of a
lunar cycle, during which its offspring come to life. On the
twenty-ninth day, which the insect knows because it is the
conjunction of the Moon with the Sun, and the birthday of
the world, it opens the ball and throws it into the water, and
the young beetles come out of it’ (Fig. Hy.”
This ball. which among the Egyptians represented “the Egg?334



THE SCARAB AND THE SCORPION
of the World,” is not perfectly round: the end is elongated, so that it is slightly pear-shaped. The hatching chamber is in the
pointed end, where the larva, just out of the egg, first begins to move. This beetle inhabits all the regions surrounding the
Mediterranean, even Provence, but it is especially numerous
in the hot countries of the Near East, where it grows to its
greatest size.
Since the days of the oldest dynasties, the scarab was connected with the symbolism of the rising sun?. Brugsch says that when it is shown in flight, it symbolizes the sun in its course’ (Fig. 2). In this position it was also the emblem of the swift, vivifying, and intelligent ray of the sun, the spiritus et mens, logos or ratio of the Ancients, that is, the breath of life, the soul, the understanding, the inspired word, reason. It is then represented with spread wings passing underneath the wing-sheaths; its front legs hold the solar disk and the hind legs the ball of dung containing the eggs of its offspring, or

perhaps the “divine seal” (Figs. 3, 4, and 5), or the “key of
life.”
The black insect and the radiant sun have one thing in
common: both are purifiers. The former demolishes foul and
noxious ordure, the other dries it up and gets rid of it with
the heat of its rays. The Egyptians considered both to be in
struments of the divinity and were grateful, transforming the
actual triviality of the little beetle’s beneficent action into pure
glory; they placed it in surroundings of perpetual light by giv
ing the scarab the “Star of the Morning” —the Venus of our
modern astronomy*, according to Maspéro—as its companion
by night, and the sun by day.
Pushing this hearth of light in front of him, the scarab ap
pears on the walls of gigantic monuments and on many in
scriptions of the most varied kinds, like a veritable light
bearer holding the torch of the world above its head. It is the
illuminator and at the same time the purifier, and also the viv
ifier, because its ball of filth is a receptacle of life, so that the
Egyptian symbolists saw in it an image of the mysterious Egg

THE SCARAB AND THE SCORPION
of the World, the life-principle itself. In their hieroglyphic language the scarab at rest is the ideograph of existence; its name, kpr (kheper, khepra) is translated by the infinitive to be>. Kheper or Khepra is Being, Existence, “which is a perpetual becoming®.” That is why in the Egypto-Hellenistic epoch, the god Khepra was connected with the symbolism of the fecund Aphrodite, the Mother Goddess. Sometimes the scarab pushes before him not the solar disk but the Egg of the World (Fig. 6), characterized by the life that emanates from it and which itself is sometimes represented by the image of the ankh or “key of life.”’ The symbolic insect, thus linked with the idea of the universal life principle, was attributed to the god Kheper or Khepra, whose head was shaped like the scarab or who carried above his head the image of the insect of the same name. “It thus symbolized the transformations that ceaselessly renew life in the world, as every morning a new sun replaces the Fig. 6 The scarab within sun of the day before”.”” Khepra—whose __ the solar disk, upheld by
name is the name of the scarab—is an as nea
image of the One God. An Egyptian ene hymn which chants the mysterious names of the immanent God expresses it thus: “Khepra is an image, Ra is an image; He himself created himself in millions of ways. He remains forever in all things, the Unique Living One in whom all things live’.” The contemplatives and wise men of the most ancient times in Egypt made a veritable microcosm of the scarab in flight. When shown in this way, its wings are separated in three parts covered successively with scales, with hair, and with feathers (Figs. 3 and 6), symbolizing fish, animals, and birds:
ocean, earth, and air—the whole universe! These three zones 3387
337



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
of the scarab’s wings, in another order of ideas, also repre
sented three planes of ascending levels: the material plane, the
psychic, and the divine.
Symbolizing the transformations through which life on earth
is maintained and perpetuated, among the Egyptians the
scarab or khepra also symbolized those that lead the human
soul beyond death to the fulfilment of their destiny. So it is
one of the images of survival and of “becoming”; the very
word khepra means “to become” and “to be transformed?.””
On the ceiling of the subterranean burial chamber of the
pharaoh Seti I, facing the place of the sarcophagus, an enor
mous scarab rolls the ball of the sun, and on each side of it
are depicted the hieroglyphs: Resurrection—Eternity!°. The
scatab keeps this same double meaning of resurrection and
eternity when it refers to the myth of Ptah, the god of ever
lasting life, “primordial father of fathers, older than the
sun,” as can be seen at Memphis where the solar insect
crowns the image of Ptah whose feet crush the crocodile, the
symbol of darkness and of evil!.
The symbol of resurrection which gives new life to beings,
and of eternity which ensures the possibility of life everlasting,
the scarab was also the symbol of the human heart which the
Egyptians regarded as the seat of the knowledge of con
science. Since this knowledge implies responsibility for one’s
actions, it follows that transformation and the soul’s future life
ate dependent on the human heart facing the tribunal of Osi
ris, he who weighs souls and whose judgment determines their
fate for all eternity. Consequently, in the process of mum
mification of the dead, a scarab of molded glass or of com
mon stone for the middle class, or of gemstone for those of
rank, was placed inside the chest in the central region of the
heart, and the hierophant who consecrated the symbol recited
a formula over it: “My heart which comes to me from my
mother, my heart necessary for my existence on earth, do not
tise up against me, do not testify against me}3,”” All the
Egyptian sacred literature consistently joins the human heart 338

with the two sacred symbols of the scarab and the vase. An Egyptian painting shows a priest who wears the head of Anubis practicing the Osirian rites over the chest of a mummy in which the scarab has just been placed (Fig. 7). This sacred insect also represents the myth of Horus, the heart of the Divinity of which Thoth is the Tongue or Word: “Horus, the Heart; that is, the spirit which animates, and Thoth, the Word, instrument of creation!*.” Thus representing Horus, it sometimes happened that the scarab was shown with a human face!®. Sometimes also the symbolic falcon of Horus carried on its head the image of the scarab within the solar disk itself (Fig. 6). The beetle, carrying the Egg of the World, “hath set his tabernacle in the sun!” and as is also said elsewhere, “O Lord my God, thou hast put on praise and beauty, and art clothed with light as with a garment!”.” Veneration for the symbolic scarab survived the disappearance of the Egyptian pharaonic religion. It persisted for some time in the same way in Phoenicia, Cyprus, Asia Minor, and even in the Mediterranean regions of central and western Europe. South of Egypt, even after the introduction of Christianity, the scarab continued to hold its place in the popular 3389
339



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
superstitions among the Copts and the Abyssinians, and pro
gressively down the length of the equatorial coasts; we even
find it once more in the eighteenth century among the Kaffrs and the Hottentots who revered the rose-chafer beetle, with
its golden glints, more religiously even than the moon it
self, which was nevertheless considered the
divine protectress and the dispenser of rain and fruitfulness!®. There are simple country traditions con
cerning several members of the beetle family who live close to us in Europe. Two of
these are the rosebug and the ladybird. The
rosebug in the popular belief brings good
fortune to anyone who finds it during the Fig 8 Three ladybird; week of Corpus Christi, especially when it
18th-century is found in the roses cut for the festival
oraamnenal moh processions. The ladybird—of which we
know over a‘hundred varieties of different colors: orange
spotted with black, black with white, yellow with purple,
etc.—is called by the country people in France God’s Crea
ture or Jesus’ Creature!®. It used to be said that it drives
away evil spirits and reverses the effects of malefic enchant
ments, perhaps because its larva is an active aphid-killer who
wages efficient war on noxious plant lice on the stems of
young plants (Fig. 8).
In ancient Europe, especially in the regions east of Italy,
the scarab was one of only two cold-blooded creatures ac
cepted in magic as a sacrificial victim; the other was the snake.
The first Christians of Egypt considered the myths of Greece and Rome, and of Syria and Persia, as accursed, but
not the old gods of their own ancestors, seeing in Horus a
sort of prefiguration of Christ, and in the ibis the symbol of his role as purifier of the world. These Christians, who recog
nized Christ in the images of the sphinx, the phoenix, the fal
con, or the eagle, must certainly have given consideration to 340



THE SCARAB AND THE SCORPION
the scarab whom their forefathers had revered in the triple role of purifier, illuminator, and vivifier. I do not know, however, of a single orthodox text that could sustain this very probable hypothesis; but it is a different matter with the Gnostics. It is well known that they borrowed a great deal from ancient Egypt, and at the foremost Christian school in Alexandria, a Gnostic text, written in Greek, says the following in the course of an invocation: “Fire has overtaken the greatest idols, and heaven has been swallowed up, knowing nothing of the circle of the holy Scarab called phorei; the scarab with wings, the Lord who dwells in the midst of heaven, has had his head pulled off, has
been torn in pieces; his greatest and most glorious powers
have been destroyed, and after being taken prisoner, the master of heaven has been put to death?°.” Under these intentionally enigmatic, mystery-veiled terms, it seems clear that “the holy Scarab” here designates Jesus Christ who for the Gnostics was identified with the young Horus seated on the sacred lotus of ancient Egypt. On a Gnostic scarab of carnelian which belonged to Canon Davin of Versailles, the line of separation between the wingsheaths of the beetle and the connection with the corselet, which naturally represent the Greek letter tau, T, are so emphasized that it is the obvious intention to underline this symbolic form which is one of the primitive images of the Christian cross. The underside of the scarab carries an open hand marked with a five-pointed star and accompanied by a crescent, a palm branch, and a sign that somewhat resembles the crooked staff carried by the augur in pagan Rome (Fig. 9). The image of the scarab, related to the Tig12 myths of Ptah and Horus, is one of the ideo- z= ak ie grams for good; on the same monuments, mei.

gling against the destructive evil principle, tramples the scor

pent2!; evidently the scorpion here is one of the signs for evil.
For the ancient symbolists, many characteristics place the
scorpion and the scarab in opposition. In the symbolic ico
nography of ancient Egypt, the scatab carries the solar disk
which is the source of life; its hind legs hold the ball which
contains its eggs and symbolizes the Egg of the World, the di
vine principle of universal life. The scorpion, on the contrary,
holds its victim in the claws of its front legs
so as to devour it, and carries behind it its
poison gland and dart, reservoir and instru
ment of death.
The scorpion’s sting is very painful and
sometimes fatal. Appolodorus assures us that
the poison is white and that the sting, often

Egyptian zodiac In the most ancient zodiacs the scorpion

of the months of October and November;
according to an author of former times, this
is because its sting is more terrible at that

tal organs, and claimed that the astral influence of the zodiacal sign Scorpio on those whom it touched led to fornication; this was also believed in early Christian times?”. From the beginning, Christian symbolism made the scorpion and its poison the sign of heresy and its ravages. At the end of the second century, Tertullian authenticated this meaning then he wrote Scorpiace, which he began with a description of the terrible insect and its method of attack. Christian art in every epoch has maintained the scorpion’s image as the representation of heresy. In the Middle Ages it was often personified as a woman pouring scorpions and reptiles of every kind from a horn of plenty’. In the heraldry of the nobility of the same period, at least in France and up until today, the scorpion stood for “impostors, slanderers, and traitors whose tongues are full of venom??.” In a different order of ideas, the Middle Ages made the scorpion one of the attributes of dialectic?°, “because it does not easily let itself be captured?!.” A fresco in the cathedral at Puy-en-Velay shows us Dialectic teaching Aristotle. She holds a lizard in her right hand (as does a similar statue at Chartres) “because it is sly, and in the left hand a scorpion, from which she has nothing to fear as she is invulnerable??.”
Fig. 12 The scorpion on a medieval zodiac, from Austria; 15th century.
On several medieval works the scorpion is shown as it were with a double life, a double malevolence, with its tail ending in a second head, that of a reptile ready to strike. This is shown by several images of the fifteenth century Grant Kalendrier et Compost des Bergiers (Shepherds Kalender), and the one I reproduce here (Fig. 12). 334433

BUTTERFLY
HE CATERPILLAR DOES not share with other kinds of worms the simple and immediate method of metamorphosis by which they emerge transformed into beautiful little beings directly from the matter on which they fed from the first day of their existence. The caterpillar, when cool weather comes and the plants that have nourished it during the summer wither and disappear, finds a shelter and installs itself there. It contracts the multiple rings of its body, pulls in its feet, and unreels from the invisible spinneret that opens on top of its head an imperceptible silken thread which it slowly and carefully wraps around itself; then it exudes a liquid which is soaked up by the silk of the cocoon, and very soon the whole length of its body is encased in an impermeable covering. It gradually disappears from view inside a rigid case: the cocoon has become a veritable coffin. In the surrounding darkness and peace, a mysterious sleep comes upon the caterpillar—a fruitful sleep, in which its wormlike aspect melts into another shape: the head is transformed and provided with antennae; the body divides itself, and all the rings that composed it become a sort of corselet from which grow wings and a long abdomen which is the only part of the new insect that is reminiscent of the worm. But all
this is still wrinkled and shrunken, the wings stuck to the 334455



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
body and indeterminate; for the former caterpillar has become
what is as yet only the chrysalis, until the first flight, under
the warmth of the sun’s rays in the free air, makes it into the butterfly.
It was by pondering the mysteries of the cocoon that our
forefathers established the analogies which have made the cat
erpillar a symbol of Christ. All worms, destined to undergo a
metamorphosis, are his emblems, but the transformation of
the caterpillar, more than that of any other larva, figures in
Christian symbolism as the representation of the broken body
of Jesus transformed into the glorious body which emerged
from the darkness of the tomb. The fifth century pontifical
decree of Pope Gelasius I declared that Christ was a worm,
not because he was humbled, and humbled himself, but “because he was resurrected”: “Vermis quia resurrexit'.”
The caterpillar, representing at the same time the body of
Christ and that of the Christian, was often depicted in early
Christian art in conditions which leave no
doubt about the symbolic intention of the artist. An example is a Roman funerary stone,
which carries the inscription: QVAE VIXIT
ANI ...In XPisto Quiescas? Below these words
are traced Christ’s monogram and a caterpil
lar?. M. de Longpérier referred to this inscrip
tion when he called attention some time ago to

centimeters long and seem to be contemporary with Mer
ovingian French art (sixth to ninth centuries). A very beauti
ful ring made of fine gold, in the Montpellier museum, has a
setting ornamented with the symbolic fish, and on each side of
the setting a caterpillar in relief: the Fish-Christ, the Ichtus,
and the double emblem of his and mankind’s resurrection*
(Fig. 1).
In several regions, the caterpillar’s chrysalis, enclosed in the darkness and silence of its cocoon, has been taken as the im- 346



THE CATERPILLAR AND THE BUTTERFLY

age of the human being that has separated itself from the agi
tation, noise, and anxiety of ordinary life to transform its inner state into a more perfect one. Some Asiatic ascetics of the Himalayas even today live in almost inaccessible caves and subsist on a minimum of food, sometimes for years®, in order to expose their souls more directly to the light of the Compassionate One, and thereby they become great gurus; they compare themselves to the huge butterflies that inhabit the marvelous valleys of the Indus and the Ganges. Mystical language made frequent mention of this analogy between the soul that works for its own transformation in the retirement of the cloister, and the ugly insect that becomes beautiful in the retirement of its cocoon. The analogy between the dead person and the caterpillar in its chrysalis state arose spontaneously in ancient Egyptian thought. Their mummified dead, wrapped in endless strips of cloth soaked in bitumen and balsams, were like the chrysalis in its silken sheath. The thought of the Greeks followed the same lines® in placing gold butterflies in the tombs to symbolize the reawakening to a new life, implied by the butterfly’s flight. For all of them, the human body was only the envelope, the container of the soul, which escaped through the gate of death just as the chrysalis breaks through the cocoon and 334477

comes out, becoming a butterfly only
on the first unfolding of its wings in the freedom of space. In the royal tombs of the My
cenaeans, contemporaries of Priam,
Schliemann found impressive butterflies
engraved on great golden disks” (Fig. Fis 9 The buterfy-soul; modem
2), and even on the pans of a small ormenea ister aid ar
pair of symbolic scales® which recall those used by Zeus, ac
cording to Homer, to weigh the fates of long sleep and of
death to which Hector would be destined®. “The butterfly
here,” Schliemann says, “is, as it is in later Greek art, the
emblem of the immortality of the human being!®.”
This interpretation remained unchanged from the time of
the Mycenaean civilization to that of Posidonius of Apameus,
in the second century before Christ; and what is certainly re
ferred to here is a soul from a level higher than our nature,
for the Pythagorean school affirmed “that the soul comes
from God and not from nature, and consequently is pre
existent to the body in which it is incarnated;
from which it draws the conclusion that once
it is separated from the body, it will escape
from pain and no longer be subject to
death!!.” The butterfly emerges from its co
coon and flies joyfully and gracefully away in
the exact image for the Ancients of “the soul
rid of its carnal covering (Figs. 3 and 4).
Fig. 4 The soul in = These butterflies, pursued by Eros in the
Pythagorean basilica of the Porta Maggiore,
are souls overcome by divine love and filled
with its delight!.”
The Greek language uses one and the same word for the
human soul and the butterfly: Psyche. And for ancient Chris
tian symbolism, the dove-winged Eros in amorous pursuit of
the butterfly Psyche, the human soul, was one of those pro
phetic symbols that the Church adopted unchanged and trans
showing Greek influence.
348



THE CATERPILLAR AND THE BUTTERFLY
ferred to Christ. In the times of the catacombs, the Roman pontiffs countenanced without hesitation the inclusion of the fable of Eros and Psyche on the sacred decoration of the underground sanctuaries. In one chamber of the catacomb of Domitilius, there are three symbolic paintings that show Eros, ardent love, and Psyche, the sought-for soul!3. In the catacombs of St. Peter and St. Marcellinus, Eros naked and Psyche clothed exchange ardent caresses and embraces; doves’ wings are attached to the shoulders of Eros-Christ, and Psyche’s carry the wings of the butterfly!*. Thus all the records of art concur in making the butterfly the emblem of the soul that has escaped from the flesh by the gateway of death and been lifted above the earthly plane by divine love. Some ancient authors used the term “flying souls” in speaking of the butterfly!>. In the countrysides of our western French provinces, there is one butterfly that is particularly attached to the symbolism of the resurrected Christ: this is the “Cleopatra” of the naturalists, which is bright yellow and very elegantly shaped and is the first of all to come forth in the sunlight of March ort April (Fig. 5). In certain regions it is called the “Easter Jesus,” because its appearance more or less coincides with Eastertide and because it is the first of the butterflies to emerge from its cocoon as from the tomb.

called the Death’s-head, which for Christians represents Satan.
Naturalists call it the sphinx atropos (Fig. 6), after one of the three Fates of Greece, she whose merciless scissors cut the
thread of human life. The death’s-head sphinx, which in France sometimes attains seven centimeters in length and thir
teen in wingspread, has a light yellow marking just above its dark thorax that resembles a skull. This ominous sign and the
stridulent sound that it sometimes makes while flying in the
night have made, and continue to make, this moth regarded as
a bearer of infernal influences and a messenger of death’’.

THE ICHNEUMON WASP & THE GRASSHOPPER
TT MONGOOSE, A little meat-eating quadruped that at
tacks reptiles and above all, at least in the Nile valley,
devours the eggs of the dreaded crocodile, was called ich
neumon by the Greeks of Egypt, and in the early days of
Christianity it became an emblem of Christ as the adversary
and destroyer of evil. Equally the Greeks of Europe applied
the name ichneumon to a kind of wasp which also renders val
uable service to mankind!. There are myriads of these ich
neumon wasps in all of the countries bordering the Black Sea,
the Euxine Sea of the Ancients (Fig. 1). These countries are
infested during the summer by hordes of ravaging grasshop
pers whose depredations are a veritable plague, and the wasps
attack them; clinging to their backs, they grip them with their
feet so that they cannot fly and plunge their sharp stings be
tween the grasshopper’s head and body. The Ancients, and up
till quite recently the entomologists also, believed that the
grasshopper thus stung died almost immediately after receiv
ing the egg that the wasp then placed in its body, and which
hatched soon after. Encyclopedias at the end of the last cen
tury gave the same information. But in fact, the grasshopper
is only paralyzed by the sting, and it is in this semi-catalyptic
state that it receives the wasp’s egg, which has thus during the
hatching process a supply of fresh, still living food. Needless 352



THE WASP AND THE GRASSHOPPER
to say, the victim dies as it is devoured from within, but it is not killed outright, even when it is small enough to be dragged into the wasp’s subterranean nest. This practice has gained the ichneumon the nickname of “grave-digger wasp.” Among the victims of the ichneumon wasp, for which in particular the ancients gave it grateful credit, is the big spider the Greeks call phalanga, similar to the tarantula and very much feared?. With equal frequency, this wasp places its eggs in the bodies of caterpillars or harmful worms. The coinage of the ancient Greeks, which often carried the image of animals and of insects less useful to humanity, never represented the ichneumon wasp—a surprising neglect among the Greeks who often depicted the bee on their coins. It seems that it was not until the Christian Middle Ages were well advanced that for the first time acknowledgment was made of the good offices of the ichneumon wasp, and it was accepted by symbologists as one of the creatures emblematic of the Savior, being recognized, like the mongoose, as the invincible enemy of evil and all its works. The grasshopper, chief victim of the ichneumon wasp, has always been an image of devastation and death among the nations it afflicts, and in the scriptures, from Moses to St. John the Evangelist, it is represented among the earth’s scourges. In Exodus, when Moses struck the Egyptians with the ten plagues that liberated Israel, the eighth of Fig. 1 these ordeals was a great cloud of grasshopThe Near-Eastem asp. Hee locusts that stripped the soil of Egypt of every green thing, and pursued the Egyptians into their houses?. And in the terrifying visions of the Apocalypse, when the great angel had cried three times: Woe to the earth! the fifth of the heavenly trumpets announced the coming plague.

bottomless pit; from Eliphas Lévi. And they had hair as the hair of
women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions. And they
had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the
sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many
horses running to battle. And they had tails like unto scor
pions, and there were stings in their tails; and their power was
to hurt men five months*.”
An example of kabbalistic iconography given by Eliphas
Lévi shows fantastic insects evidently inspired by this passage
in the Apocalypse? (Fig. 2), and there are several other exam
ples alluded to by Grimouard de Saint-Laurent®. I remember
that one of them shows the grasshopper clothed in the cuirass
of a knight and helmeted with the bassinet, engraved with a crown of flowers, that was in use at the end of the fourteenth
century. When in the twelfth century the Benedictine monks
decorated the church of their magnificent abbey at Vézelay,
their sculptors carved in the stone capital of a pillar the image
of a grasshopper with a human head, next to another of
Satan’s emblems, the basilisk, completing its “demonic significance’.”

In the course of time, the grasshopper also became for Christian symbolists the image of the heretic, and of any propagator of error, of discord, or of rebellion who sought to devastate the field so generously sown by the divine Sower (Fig. 3).

THE MANTIS
AND THE SPIDER
HAT SINGULAR LITTLE creature, the mantis, measures
five or six centimeters in length, and varies in color,
mostly through every shade of green, according to differences
not only in species but in location. Here we are speaking only
of the praying mantis, the mantis religiosa of Linnaeus, which
inhabits the whole Mediterranean basin and several of the
winegrowing regions of western France, as for instance Poitou
and Anjou!.
The mantis’ body is provided with a long corselet to which
are attached two large arms. When it is still, the praying
mantis folds these arms in the gesture of supplication that has
given it its names: in Provence, it is called lou prego Dio, “the
one who prays to God?,” and elsewhere, the “praying mantis,”
the “devotee” (Fig. 1), and also for reasons which we shall
find later, “the guide.” :
The customs of the mantis are atrociously cruel. It feeds
only on living things, and the female
devours the head of the male during
their sexual union, and lets go her hold
on him only to push away a corpse.
This cruelty, which is common to a
number of insects, was probably un
known to the Greeks who greatly hon- Ls
ored the mantis: they attributed to it Fig 1 Mantis in its praying
strange divinatory powers, manteia, from posture; from Fabre.
356



THE MANTIS AND THE SPIDER
which came the name they gave it of mantis, the seer, the inspired, the prophet. They said that on first sight of a traveler, this little creature divined the goal of his journey and the dangers awaiting him on the way, and indicated to him with a clear gesture the direction to take to avoid them (Fig. 2). Another, also very ancient, idea made the mantis the symbol of the ease with which human thought adapts itself to its surroundings. M. Beule says: “The praying mantis is a graceful insect which as soon as it is approached folds its forelegs,
joins them together and seems to ask for mercy; in Attica it
is observable how it takes on the color of the ground it inhabits, and is green in verdant areas, gray on bare ground, rust on the sun-scorched rocks. In the same way, the human
being becomes the reflection of those around him; aware of
the impressions of others, in spite of himself he borrows the color of their ideas?.” This agrees with the proverb: “Tell me the company you keep, and Iwill tell you who you are.” Former Christian symbolists, among the learned, the clerical, or simple country-folk informed by popular tradition of the mantis’ claim to the power of divination and its charitable use of this gift to help travelers, saw in it as in several other
creatures an image of the “Good Guide,” for whose divine aid the Catholic liturgy appeals: Tu dux ad astra et semita sis meta nostris cordibus*: “Mayst thou, our guide and path toward heaven, be the goal of our hearts’ desires.” Thus, according to the imaginations of our forefathers, the mantis goes to the help of those who have strayed and gives them counsel: its long arms are lifted first as if to mean that all help comes from heaven; then their tips join as if in ardent prayer, and finally extend and point in the right direction. It is the image of Christ, the guide of souls. On the other hand, the hideous

THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
esis of the pious mantis: the spider places its treacherous am
bushes everywhere, stopping the joyful flight of winged in
sects, paralyzing them in its web, in order to kill and devour
them. All spiders have underneath their mouths two organs
provided with sharp hooks and a groove through which comes
the poison with which they numb their victims before killing
them. The Ancients sometimes exaggerated the gravity of the
spider’s bite, but it is nevertheless true that it is always harm
ful to people, and sometimes fatal. The spider that causes the
most fear in Europe is the tarantula, which is sometimes four
or five centimeters long, and is common in south and central
Italy and in Sicily, Albania, and western Greece. Actually, its
bite is not as dangerous as was formerly supposed. There was
an odd treatment for those who were ill with its poison that
used to prevail in Italy: the victims had to dance without
stopping to the repetition of music of a stirring rhythm,
known as the tarentella, until they dropped from exhaustion.
This however was not the only remedy used against the taran
tula’s venom: the ancient Greeks, very reasonably I think, pre
ferred the juices of the herb phalangion which was thought to
cure the hallucinations and delirium brought on by the taran
tula’s bite. Aelian says that deer cure themselves of this poi
son by eating wild ivy’. There are two other kinds of spider in
France that have an evil reputation: one is
called the death spider, the victims of whose
bite are said never to survive more than five or
RL six months; and the St. Fiacre spider, a hand

cross. In the case of the unfortunate spider, however, the
cross is said to be “upside down” and consequently “the de
vil’s cross.” So the St. Fiacre spider, which almost never bites,
and is much less evil than its reputation, receives a large 358



THE MANTIS AND THE SPIDER
share of the dislike which people have in general for spiders.
Ancient oneiromancy or divination by.dreams declared that
to dream of a spider spinning its web foretold an error of
judgment that could endanger the dreamer’s honor, fortune, or
very existence’. And among the country folk of France, at
least, spiders are definitely associated with evil spirits. Mystics
like Anne-Catherine Emmerich affirm that insects for whom
people feel an instinctive aversion are often connected with
troubled or maleficent spirits’, What is incontestable is that
these beliefs have played a real role in popular symbolism.
Other spiders in various other countries must have been the
subjects of beliefs founded partly on fact and partly on super
stition; throughout Christianity, this insect has been regarded
as an image of Satan, the treacherous pursuer of souls which
are represented (exceptionally, but in this instance as in the
symbolism of the swallow) by the small flying creatures that
stray into his toils. Seated in the center of his web or hidden
in a dark corner, he awaits his victims who are hopelessly lost
the moment they are caught. In the thirteenth century, Pierre
le Picard says in his Bestiary that the spider is the image of the devil who weaves and tends his webs, and works to take
and destroy the souls of those who through lust, drunkenness,
murder, or covetousness fall into his traps®. In ancient ico
nography, the spider most often represents the demon of lust
and mote especially its customary agent, the seductive and
provocative prostitute; it is she who is represented in those
jewels in whose design the spider is at the center of the web
(Fig. 4). Sometimes a naked woman replaces the insect (Fig.
5), recalling the fabled Amazons described by Pomponius
Mela, whose chief weapons are nets in which they entangle
their adversaries and then drag them to death behind their chariots?.
In Christian spirituality, the spider web itself represents in
the first place “vain works,” such as have no value in God’s
eyes. “Pray for us personally,” St. Paulinus of Nola wrote in
the year 405, “that we may not be misled into weaving spider 335599

webs, accomplishing works without merit!®.” The delicate
tissue of the spider web was also the image of human frailty;
as a puff of wind, a flying cockchafer, a falling flower can tear
the web, so a trifle can destroy the life or health of a human
being, and nothing is more fragile than the integrity of his
conscience or the duration of his happiness.
Another idea makes the spider web represent heterodox
teachings, in which souls become entangled and cannot free
themselves. This symbolism was widely used in the Catholic
Church, especially at the beginning of the spread of
Protestantism.
From a different point of view, the symbolists of India and
its sacred books were interested in the connection of the spi
der and its work with the symbolism of weaving. According to
René Guénon, their webs, composed of threads patterned in
concentric circles and others radiating from the center to the
edges, were considered images of the pattern of the cos
mogonic sphere, and the spider itself in the middle of this
planisphere they took as the representation of the sun, the
heart of the world!!.
Referring to the treacherous cruelty of the spider, which
embraces other insects in order to inject its fatal poison, the
European heraldists saw the insect as a symbol of traitors like
Judas. In the West, the medieval heraldic science took the spi
der and its web as images of the dishonest judge who makes
exceptions for different persons. A later echo of this idea 360



THE MANTIS AND THE SPIDER
comes from Vulson de la Colombiére: “It is the symbol of the corrupt judge and of the inequality of the laws, as the wise Solon said, who compared the laws with spider webs because they hold small flies but are not strong enough to retain the big ones which pass through them; as in the same way it is the little people who are enslaved by the harshness of the law, of which the great ones of the world take no account!?.” The mantis and the spider are equally ferocious; the embrace of either is fatal. But the former has the advantage of the latter because of two fortunate gestures which recall that which is most uplifting in the human being: prayer and charity. And people make of it the image of Christ, the savior and guide of mankind; and the other becomes the emblem of Satan!>.

THE UNICORN
EW ANIMALS, REAL or fabulous, have been such favorites F as the unicorn in the whole field of symbolism in the arts, literature, and practices of the Middle Ages, among mystics, symbolists, artists, doctors, even magicians and sorcerers of all kinds. This unusual preference could only have grown up from very ancient roots; so it should not be surprising to find the unicorn’s image in the art of the oldest civilized nations. I have found it in Chaldean and Babylonian artifacts, notably a cylindrical seal engraved on semiprecious stone, reproduced by Soldi!; two winged unicorns rear on hind legs on each side of the sacred Tree (Fig. 1). Perhaps from equally ancient times, Chinese sacred art shows a fabulous animal of the deer family with a single fron- Fig: 1 The unicom on a tal horn, called ki-lin; the male is called Babylonian’ seat ki, the female lin. The appearance of a ki-lin in China was cause for national rejoicing, because it was said that it could only happen during the reign of a sovereign who was perfectly just and beloved by heaven, and that it opened an era of prosperity for the country”. Even today it is said there that it is unicorns that bring human babies to their mothers, and their images are much-used luck-bringers in the family3. The Chinese unicorn, however, sometimes lacks the grace and elegance of its occidental counterpart, as shown by the unattrac
tive monster whose faithful likeness is reproduced by Doré*. 336655



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
Four hundred years before our era, the Greek Ctesias, phy
sician to Artaxerxes, King of Persia, lauded the supposed
medical properties of the unicorn’s horn’; Philostratus copied
him®; and among the Latin writers, Aelian” and Pliny® spread
and amplified the fantasies that Ctesias had gathered from the
Persians and the Medes. Here is Pliny’s bizarre description of
the unicorn: “It is an intractable beast with a body similar to
that of a horse, a head like a deer, feet like an elephant, and
a tail like a wild boar; it makes a low-pitched bellowing
sound, and has a single black horn two cubits long in the
middle of its forehead. It is said that this beast cannot be
taken alive.”
In the Bible, the unicorn is spoken of as if it were several
different animals: Moses and David, for example, sometimes
give it several horns, and European translators have added to
the confusion. The Vulgate says: Salva me ex
ore leonis, et a cornibus unicornium humilitatem
meam: “Save me from the lion’s mouth; and
my lowness from the horns of the uni
corns®,” while Crampon translates literally
from the Hebrew: “Save me from the lion’s
mouth, take me from the horns of the buf
falo!°.” In other passages from Judaic writ
ings, the unicorn was identified with the
Fig. 2 The oryx onager of India, with deer and zebras, and
designated as a unicom especially with the oryx'! as in the case of

ioned the monster column in the monastery

tullian to whom the unicorn was the one-horned oryx of the
Ancients!2. However, the most essential characteristic of the
unicorn is the horse-shaped body and the long, straight, for
ward pointing horn, often spirally grooved. The oryx, on the
contrary, is usually represented in medieval art with its single
horn curved backwards.

aldists, often endowed the unicorn with a goat’s beard which their predecessors had never given it. Those who looked among various kinds of onagers for the prototype of the fabulous animal have relied on what Philostratus wrote in the second century in his life of Apollonius of Tyana, that in the marshes near the river Phasis there are wild asses that have one frontal horn with which they fight as furiously as bulls}. In any case, before our era people of almost all countries thought of the unicorn, in spite of the elegance of form generally attributed to it, as an invincible and very dangerous animal. It was fancied that it could never be captured by any hunter, but that a pure woman, virginal in spirit, heart, and body, attracted it irresistibly and that she alone could lay hands on it. It was said that when the animal found her, it would kneel down in front of her and lay its head against her breast and caress her gently; and at this moment, the huntsman treacherously hidden nearby would spring out and give the unicorn its death blow, or bind it with ropes by which it could be led away captive (Fig. 3). The ninth-century book, the Roman d’Alexandre'*, tells us that “if she is not a virgin, the unicorn, far from lying in her lap, kills the corrupted girl who is not a maiden...” We find the same imaginings in the fifteenth century, in the writings of Brunetto Latini!>. 336677



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
Strange fantasies also arose involving the astonishing vir
tues of the unicorn’s horn, going even farther than the tales
spun by Ctesias; it was said that if filings of the horn were
swallowed, or simply applied to wounds, this was a sovereign
remedy that would counteract the venom of the most danger
ous reptiles, and would cure madness, the plague, epilepsy,
gangrene, etc. Vessels made of this horn were a protection
against all sorts of evils and rendered the worst poisons harm
less, so they are often listed in royal inventories and described
as richly ornamented: “A unicorn horn ewer adorned with
gold and surrounded with a number of small gemstones ...a
goblet of unicorn horn adorned with gold ...!© In the Inven
tory of Charles V, mention is made of two goblets of unicorn
horn, richly mounted and decorated with diamonds and pre
cious stones; and all these listings include a large number of
different vessels described as containing fragments of the
horn!’.
In actual fact, this rare and almost universal panacea was
simply the ground horn of a cetacean of the dolphin family,
the one-horned narwhal that inhabits the seas of Europe and
Asia. This fact explains why unicorns were nearly always de
picted with horns twisted like screws, and immensely long. La
Colombiére!® gives a precise measure: six and a half feet, or
two meters twenty; a bothersome appendage for a quadruped
the size of a deer. So it is not surprising to see that the
sword-handle of the emperor Maximilian of Austria, called
“The Unicorn’s Blade,” is made of narwhal horn’?. The an
cient treasure of the Abbey of St. Denis, now in the Cluny
Museum in Paris, which was taken for a unicorn horn, is that
of a natwhal. It looks like a long twisted Easter candle in pale
wax.
“Tt is easy to see,” says Professor Hippeau, “why the uni
corn appears so often in Christian iconography?°.” The Divine
Bestiaries, following the ancient Physiologus, dedicated the no
ble animal to the symbolism of Christ, and the Bestiaries of
Lave comnared it to that other lord of suffering, which is the _ 368



THE UNICORN
poor humble human heart. For the former, the old legend of the unicorn, the virgin, and the hunter was a theme eminently suited to represent the Incarnation and the redemptive sacrifice of the Son of God. Thus the unicorn became the symbolic image of Christ descending through his bodily birth into the bosom of humanity, represented by the maiden in the legend; and the hunter was the counterpart of the Jewish people who put the Savior to death?!. Among many other medieval
writers, Honorius d’Autun, who died in 1140, saw in the
maiden of the legend the double image of humanity and of the Virgin Mary?2; others emphasize her complicity with the hunter and hence humanity’s role in causing Christ’s death by treachery. Here is William of Normandy:
Thesus-Crist, nostre Sauveor Jesus Christ our Savior “est ’'Unicorne espiritel Is the spiritual unicorn, Qui en la Virge prist ostel, Who made his dwelling in the Virgin, Qui est tant de grand dignité; He who is of such high dignity; En ceste prist humanité In her he put on his humanity Par quei au munde s’aparut; Through which he manifested himself to the world: Son peuple mie nel quenut His people did not recognize him? Des Jeves einceis l’espiérent On the contrary, the Jews spied on him Tant qu’il le pristrent et Finally they took him and bound liérent. him Devant Pilatre le menérent They led him before Pilate Et ilec a mort le dampnérent. And soon condemned him to death?4.
In the medieval bestiary quoted by de Caumont??, the unicorn is also the emblem of Christ, the maiden is Mary, and the hunter represents the Jewish people. In the last years of the fourth century St. John Chrysostom formulated another symbolic motif according to which “uni
corns are the righteous, above all Jesus Christ who fights his 336699



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
adversaries with his cross as if it were a horn; this is the horn
in which we put our trust?6.” Nevertheless, this interpretation
was not retained by the medieval symbolists, for whom the
unicotn’s horn meant the Savior’s divine force and power; in
the words of David, “But my horn [my force} shalt thou exalt
like the horn of an unicorn?’.”
Another aspect of this symbolism relating Christ and Mary
is brought out in Parnassus, the magazine of the College Art
Association of America, where Mrs. E. C. Marquand points
out that in the fifteenth-century “unicorn tapestries” as they
are called, there is always a central tree, like the Tree of Life,
whose “axial” significance is in accordance with that of the
Fig. 4. The death of the unicorn; 12th-century sculpture from Strasbourg Cathedral.
single horn?8. In fact, the presence of this central tree goes
much farther back in time in its artistic relations with the uni
corn than the fifteenth-century tapestries. It is present, for in
stance, in a Strasbourg sculpture pictured here (Fig. 4) and in
many others. The tree, when it appears singly in works of art
relating to Christian symbolism, most often has the signifi
cance of world-axis, which is one of the aspects of Christ; and
it is always the case with the “cross-shaped tree” whose
branches form the sign of the cross, as we often see it in the
Roman catacombs.
In connection with the Tree of Life as it was considered in
the Parnassus article, Guénon points out that if one recalls
Virgil’s Iam redit et Virgo, a connection may be glimpsed be
tween the unicorn and the virgin with quite a different mean- 370



THE UNICORN
ing from any given by the habitual interpretations?9. It is possible that certain medieval masters may have pursued the symbolism of the unicorn to this point, but certainly such a depth of interpretation would have been limited to a very small number of people. In the same period, in the mystical. “Triumphs,” unicorns drew the chariot of Chastity?°. Earlier, because of its links with the idea of virginity, writers of sacred texts such as St. Bonaventure in the thirteenth century made the unicorn symbolize the Virgin, the mother of Christ, the “All-Holy” of the Byzantines?!. A variation in the symbolic representation of Christ’s Incarnation through the unicorn legend took place in the last petiod of the Middle Ages, which has been preserved in some very interesting pieces of art. In an English work we find this quotation from the French: “It is well-known that in the sixteenth century (and earlier) the mystery of the Incarnation was often represented by the following allegory: a unicorn taking refuge in the bosom of a pure virgin, four hounds rapidly pursuing it, a winged huntsman sounding a horn. The mystical zoology of the time helps to provide an explanation: The fabulous animal whose single horn wounds only to cleanse of all poison whatever part of the body it touches is the image of Jesus Christ, the physican and savior of souls. The hounds are given the names of Misericordia, Veritas, Justitia and Paz, the four reasons which induced the eternal Word to emerge from his repose; but as it was through the Virgin Mary that he chose to descend among men and put himself in their power, it was thought best to choose the fable of a maiden serving as a trap for the unicorn by the attraction presented to him of the charm and perfume of her virginal breast; finally the angel Gabriel, taking part in the mystery, was easily recognizable beneath the appearance of the winged huntsman urging on the hounds and blowing his trumpet??.” The names of the mystical hounds vary; sometimes they are the mercy and the love of Christ for human beings, his 337711

spirit of justice and obedience in relation with the Father; and
in an engraving made about 1440 in the Bibliothéque Na
tionale in Paris, the dogs have the names Castitas, Veritas, Hu
militas??. On a sixteenth century copper medallion reproduced
by Cloquet, the dogs are not given any names (Fig. 5). There
are other striking representations of the archangel huntsman
and his dogs**.
Many learned Christians, notably Hippeau in his edition of
the Bestiaire divin, have taken note of the moral, but altogether
human, meaning that the Bestiaries of Love attached to this
same legend of the unicorn and the maiden. They have seen
in it the allegory of a man who through his loyal love of a
woman puts his trust in her and is deceived and betrayed.
Throughout the Middle Ages, “our singers and story-tellers
have often compared to the unicorn the cavalier defeated by
Tava and hy the Tadv3>.”

THE UNICORN
Fig. 6 Armorial bearings of the Duval,
lords of Mondrainville, 16th century.
The unicorn was one of the favorite subjects in the heraldic art of the Middle Ages; it was seen in helmets and shields, on banners, on seals, in the decoration of knightly tourneys and of “courts of love.” In all these different roles, it always meant faithful attachment to purity of life, the shunning of vice, and the attraction to beauty. In those days, since the bestiaries were everywhere, the unicorn was generally known as a symbol of Christ and appeared as such on the coats of arms of certain priests and nobles (Fig. 6). Although it was perhaps in reality the natural prototype of the unicorn, the rhinoceros became its antithesis in Christian symbolism. It seems to be what Job describes under the name of Behemoth, the evil monster that is the brother of Leviathan, who eats grass like the ox, who carries his sword in front of him and lives hidden “in the covert of the reed, and
in moist places?© (Fig. 7).” 337733

Contrary to the unicorn who, it is said, searches for sweet smells and pure things, the rhinoceros wallows in the mud and slime of the marsh; it stands for filth as the unicorn stands for purity. Its horn was taken to be one of the emblems of the demon of

mystics regarded it as the image of the force of God’s wrath
because of the terrifying violence of its anger.

THE WINGED HORSE
HE HORSE IN its real shape, but provided by human "Tiinagination with great wings, is one of the most elegant creations of symbolic art. Many centuries before the Christian era, the winged horse was engraved on the cylindrical seals of the Babylonians, and in and around the part of Asia they inhabited it was sometimes shown with a human face!. The Median and Persian artists depicted winged horses long before the classical myth was thought of, and characterized it with a kind of dotted band crossing the wings*. Perhaps it was this influence that carried the winged horse motif across Asia to appear in China in the early epochs?. The graceful silhouette of the air-borne horse also pleased the very early European artists, and upon it the Greek poets built the legend of Pegasus (Fig. 1). Its image was engraved on the coins of numerous cities that were under Grecian influence; the Romans followed suit, and so did the Gauls. Among the Scandinavians, the name of Falke (falcon) which was given to the horse of the hero Thedrek leads one to suppose that this was a winged horse*. And in the world of literature, the Bible speaks of the horses of fire who drew up to heaven the flaming chariot of the great prophet, Elijah the Tishbite’. It must be remembered that the Ancients believed in the real existence of winged horses which they said came from that same land of Ethiopia whence came also the hippogriffs and the centaurs. According to Pliny, these Ethiopian horses
had not only wings but horns like those of bulls®, which led 376

Joannes de Cuba to describe them in that form and as objects of terror to other animals’. But hear the poets: Born from the blood of Medusa flowing from the sharp edge of Perseus’ sword, Pegasus as he sprang to birth struck Mt. Parnassus with his hoof and thus caused the fountain of Hippocrene to gush forth; later the Muses plunged into its waters and found inspiration there. Perseus, going to the rescue of Andromeda, mounted Pegasus who carried him in swift flight to the place where a sea
monster held her captive’. Bellerophon also captured Pegasus 337777



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
in the fields of Hippocrene and rode on his back to conquer
the terrible Chimera and then to vanquish the Solymians and
the Lycians; whereupon, blinded with pride, he attempted to
mount into the sky, but Pegasus in full flight threw off his
rider who fell tragically to his death, and the beautiful animal
swiftly lifted itself into the sky and took its place in the group
of stars that bears its name.
With the victories of Perseus and Bellerophon over mon
sters and barbarians, this myth lends itself to certain allegories
that the early symbolists, especially in Greece, might have
been tempted to apply to Christ and the Christian; but on the
other hand, the fall of the presumptuous Bellerophon pre
sented a difficulty, and the mystics who tried to make use of
the myth did not arrive at anything very satisfactory. It was
rather by attributing to Pegasus the role of mount to
Phoebus-Apollo, god of pure light and pure beauty, and by
making it often the image of Apollo Conservator, the Pre
server®, that ancient art and literature managed to include the
winged horse in the symbolic fauna of the
Savior. In Rome itself, from the first Chris
tian centuries, it can be seen how “the Sun
god becomes Christ who lifts himself from
the earth with the sun’s glory!°.”
The winged horse took his place in the
ivory mosaics of Roman Christianity, on the
Christian lamps of Carthage!! (Fig. 2), and
elsewhere, about the third or fourth century,
or later; it was represented, by itself, in the
Fig. 2 The winged bore center of a circular medallion in the Roman

for a buried body!4. This was surely not a random choice;
and certainly it was with Christian meaning that the Middle
Ages introduced the winged horse into ecclesiastical and mo- 3378

nastic art: it is depicted, for example, in the Romanesque frescoes of the ancient Abbey of Saint Savin in Vienne!> (Fig. 3). Islam also created two winged horses which carried two human beings to the kingdom of heaven. It is the Moslem belief that God created for our first father Adam a horse made of amber and pure musk which he named the horse Mamoun. He gave it two wings made of precious stones and brought it to life. Mounted on this winged horse and guided by the archangel Gabriel, Adam in his lifetime visited the heaven of the Angels, and it was there that he learned the words of praise that are for the Moslems the greatest of all prayers:
“God is great and contains in himself Fige3 Pie slinged horse insche

all the greatnesses that can be imagined! 16” The other winged horse of Islam is Burag, the silver-gray mare on whose back Moahammed made his famous “Night Journey” from Mecca to Jerusalem, and thence to heaven!”. The scholars of Islam say that Buraq will be the first quadruped that God will bring back to life on the last day; angels will place on its back a saddle made of shining rubies, and put in its mouth a bit of pure emerald, and lead it to the prophet’s tomb. God will then revive Mohammed who, after speaking with the angels, will mount Buraq and be carried into the heavens!8,

THE CENTAUR
OST AUTHORS THINK that the fabulous creature with the torso of a man and the lower body of a horse was the product of the poetic and artistic imagination of ancient Greece, where it was said that a whole race of these creatures lived in the mountains of Thessaly between the massifs of Ossa and Pelion, where they were finally exterminated by their enemies the Lapiths!. However, the Egyptian centaur engraved on a basalt tablet now in the Bologne museum opens the question as to whether this mythical creature was not a Greek borrowing from the more ancient art of Egypt. Putting aside the Greek fable that placed a nation of centaurs at the foot of Mt. Pelion, it seems probable that the centaur, taken singly, was in the earliest times a symbol that put the ptincipal qualities represented by the horse, especially strength and speed, at the service of the intelligence of man. This idea is reinforced by the pieces of Etruscan art that show not only the horse-centaur but also the even swifter deer-centaur? and dog-centaur?, both thought to be images of the diligent
and devoted servant (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 The deer-centaur and the
dog-centaur; Etruscan bronzes.
338811



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
Bronzes of Etruscan manufacture often depicted a strange
creature with not only the torso but the complete body of a
human, also having the hindquarters of an animal, as is the
case with the deer-centaur and dog-centaur pictured above;
and the Greeks themselves sometimes adopted this curious
notion. The centaur in its ordinary form appeared on some of
their coins; and on the gold coins of the Gauls of what is now
Poitou, it became the androcephalous horse in which the hu
man element was reduced to the head alone. This seemed to symbolize the activity of the nation’s intelligence, and perhaps even a Druidic idea of a higher order—its equine character doubtless maintaining the role of animal ‘of light which we recognized in the horse’s symbolism‘, since the man-headed horse was on the
other side of the coins from the head of Belenus, the god of
light? (Fig 2).
But if in the ancient world the centaur symbolized the valu
able qualities of activity, speed, and strength at the service of
conscious human intelligence, above all and more frequently it
symbolized these same qualities at the service of evil human
passions: of pride, represented by the man’s head, of lust by
his torso and greed by his hands. In several cults, centaurs
were looked upon as genies, secondary “daemons” of the
lower world. Only one—their king, Cheiron—was not in
cluded in this unfavorable regard. Nevertheless, especially
among the Greeks, the centaurs had some higher qualifica

Simply from the fact of its role as psychagogue, conductor

could claim a place in the front rank of creatures emblematic of the Savior, from the beginning of Christian symbolism. Nevertheless, owing doubtless to the low esteem in which it was held, the centaur was almost completely excluded from the first thousand years of Christian art; however, during the first centuries of the second millennium, the attention of contemplatives was arrested by the centaur’s double nature whose two parts, taken separately, were regarded sympathetically in Christian symbolism pig 3 The centaur Cheivon carrying as an allegorical image of the dou- Eros; antique marble statue. ble nature of Christ, in the same way as in other myths of hybrid creatures. The centaur’s human part represents Christ’s divinity as Man made in the image of God; and the animal part represents his humanity, attached with four feet to the earth which is man’s kingdom and which gives him his physical food. An exception to the low opinion in which the centaur was generally held was always made in favor of the most famous member of their race, Cheiron; mythology sets him above and apart from all the others and presents him as a being of high intelligence, moral quality, wisdom, and goodness. The Greek story says he was the son of Kronos and of Philyra, the linden tree. St. Justin, in the second century of our era’, wrote that he was the friend and counselor of Phoebus-Apollo, and the friend also of Heracles, Aesculapius, and Jason. He became the loved and respected teacher of Achilles, of the Dioscuri, Palamedes, and Theseus; and finally, it was at his side that the divine Dionysus learned sacred science.
The school of Pythagoras made much of these qualities of 338833

educator attributed to Cheiron, and drew from them some
useful examples and lessons; so it is not surprising to see the
master and one of his most famous pupils represented in the
rich decoration of the Pythagorean basilica of the Porta Mag
giore in Rome®. Pindar, writing some five hundred years be
fore our era, claimed that after twenty years of study with this
incomparable teacher, his pupils could be certain of never
committing or uttering a reprehensible act or word’. It is said
by some that Cheiron sometimes took care of that enfant terrible, the child Eros (Fig. 3).
The fable tells us that it was Cheiron who taught men the
medical secrets of plants, who restored the sight of blind
Phoenix, the son of Amyntor!°, and brought Peleus the king
of Thessaly back from the dead. At last, though born immor
tal, Cheiron chose to die. Homer eulogized him as “the only
just Titan!!,” thereby explaining how the good centaur be
came the object of a cult among the Magnesians of Thessaly,
and justifying the beautiful works of pagan art that glorify
him. Among these is the fine painting of the villa Iten, in
Pompeii, which shows him teaching Dionysus the divine ritual,
and the famous fresco at Herculaneum where we see him
teaching the art of melody to the young Achilles on the
seven-stringed lyre.
Christian art of the first millennium also made an exception
of him in its otherwise rigorous exclusion of the centaurs. A
large bronze tablet from the sixth century in the Cairo mu
seum is decorated with several scenes of Thetis entrusting the young Achilles to Cheiron’s care.
Later, the medieval mystics would connect the good cen
taur, the incomparable physician, who could restore the sight
of the blind and bring the dead back to life, with Christ who
said of his own work: “The blind receive their sight, and the
lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the
dead are raised up...!2 During the same period, medical sci

blood of a hoopoe and put in the oil of a lamp, produced
marvelous visions and inspirations!?. But the vices which antiquity attributed to the centaur made it a natural symbol of the evil passions and so of Satan.
Origen, in the second century, compared the depraved man to
the centaur, with the same concept which made the horse and
the mare emblems of lust!4. St. Basil, in the fourth century,
made it the image of the devil; and the Coptic life of St. Paul
the hermit tells that Satan showed himself to St. Anthony in the desert “in the form of a centaur, half man and half
horse!>.” With the same idea of a satanic image, Giotto painted a centaur on the fresco at Assisi where he represented St. Francis’s triumph over his passions and over hell. The female centaur was the image of the woman who forgets her
dignity due to excessive curiosity.
It also represents, like the mare with the woman’s face of our twelfth-century Roman sculptors!®, the voluptuous woman in general and especially the seductress

bolism in Italy is given by The Divine Comedy, where Dante
places all the centaurs in Hell, including Cheiron'’. It need
hardly be added that in his immortal masterpiece the poet
made no claim to interpret the symbolism of the myths of
which he spoke in perfect accord with the traditional opinions
of his day.
The gods of light, who were always at the same time gods
of love and of beauty, have forever been the best-loved and the most readily served. And all of them, or almost all, have

archer-god on the most ancient Chaldean monuments. On a
seal in the Duke of Luynes’ collection, the Babylonian god
Marduk fights thus with the monster Tiamat!®; this struggle
at the world’s beginnings, according to Babylonian mythology,
ensured the triumph of the benevolent gods over the powers
of chaos. Among the Assyrians, the Sun-god was shown on
the solar wheel with his bow in hand (Fig. 5).
Among the Persians, the god Ormuzd was represented by
the image of an archer, sometimes on horseback; and on the
coins of the Achaemenid kings, he wears a crown. In India,
Karna, son of a virgin and the Sun, whose myth goes back to
at least the fourth century before our era, becomes a skillful
bowman when he grows up”°.
Ancient Greek artists represented Apollo and his female
counterpart, Artemis, as two archers, because the Sun and the Moon, which are consecrated to them, shoot their
rays to the earth like luminous shafts 2!. The bow, which ancient

the hieroglyph of energy or force, and the arrow is that of
speed. Because of this symbolism, and because the equine
body of the centaur is equally the symbol of swift strength,
and also because according to the myth the fabulous centaurs
of Thessaly were particularly skillful bowmen, at an early date
the Greeks made the centaur-archer the symbol of Phoebus
Apollo under the name of Apollo Conservator?*. In Europe, the
Gallic Belenus, god of all light, was envisaged, like the Sun
god of Sardaigne, in the form of an archer??.
The Romans followed the example of the Greeks and fre
quently gave the centaur-archer the symbolic meaning of
Apollo as the Sun. In Rome itself during Constantine’s reign,
Christ replaced this god in all his aspects that could be recon- 386



THE CENTAUR
ciled with the Christian teaching, and this substitution was
often celebrated in art. It is thus that the archer and the centaur-archer gained entrance among the personal symbols of Christ. “Because I have bent Juda for me as a bow,” says Zacharias “... And the Lord God shall be seen over them and his dart shall go forth as lightning?*+.” And David: “He hath bent his bow, and made it ready. And in it he hath prepared the instruments of death, he hath made ready his arrows for them that burn?>.” It is in the role of triumphant vanquisher of his and his Church’s enemies that Jesus Christ has always been recognized in the enigmatic image of the archer; and this symbolism is authenticated by the Book of Revelation which says of the divine rider on the white horse: “He that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him; and he went forth conquering, and to conquer?®.” A twelfth-century French miniature, reproduced by the Abbé J. Corbelet in L’Art Chrétien, represents not Jehovah, god of combat, but Christ haloed with his cross, Fig. 6 Christ armed with sword
holding the two weapons which the Book — 34 62% froma 12th-century

of Revelation attributes to him, the sword and the bow with its arrows (Fig. 6). Earlier, toward the end of the fourth century, a Christian woman of Vermand (Aisne) wore on her finger a superb gold ring which she carried to her tomb; the monogram of Christ, X and P superimposed, which decorates the setting, is formed by a bundle of arrows, a reminder that the Savior is the divine archer who looses his shafts in all directions?’. In Christian symbology, archers whether humans or centaurs, are always hunters of souls; often they represent Christ himself fighting against evil, or taking possession of souls. Medieval art frequently presents images of centaur-archers. When they are seen directing their shafts against an evil mon- 338877

ster, they can be seen as representing the divine Archer in his
war against Satan. If on the other hand the arrow threatens a
harmless creature like a deer or a non-rapacious bird (Fig. 7),
then it is the divine hunt for souls which seeks to take posses
sion of them even by means of the painful dart of suffering,
for their ultimate happiness. But when the archer, whether hu
man or animal, directs his shaft toward heaven, it is always
the symbol of Satan. It is then represented with a hideous
body and a horrible face (Fig. 8). Equally disturbing and not
to be taken in a good light are the centaurs, whether archers
or not, whose peculiar features are so exaggerated as to ac
centuate their monstrous character—such as one in the clois
ter of St. Aubin of Angers, of the seventeenth century, which
has a woman’s torso on a four-footed masculine body?®.
In the Greek language, the words for
bow and life are connected. The Christ
Archer was thus regarded as the propulsive force of life, and medieval herme
tism preserved this connection with the
archer as a symbol of Jesus, and with his
weapon, the bow, in accordance with the
Jewish Kabbalah which makes the He
brew letter haf the ideogram of the im
pulsive force®, because this letter is
shaped like a bow. The expansion of this
force, in action, is the full manifestation of life.

ing of the bowman in medieval astrology, because it agrees in a way with that of the centaur-psychagogue that has been spoken of. The constellation of Sagittarius whose conventional sign is the arrow?° governs the ninth month of the astronomic year which begins on the first day of spring; so it rules what astrology calls “the ninth house,” which corresponds to the ninth part of its cycle of the year and to the month of November. The old astrologists said that the astral influence of this constellation of Sagittarius had among other effects that of lifting toward God the thoughts and affections of numerous human beings; thus it led spirits from the lower, material plane toward higher regions.

F D
THE MANTICORE
N THEIR INSATIABLE hunger for marvels, our fathers created impossible lions which held a place in the ranks of
more or less symbolic monsters and, being almost always
placed on the side of evil, were often employed as evocations of the Lord of Hell. One of the most ancient Christian depictions of the lion of
the sea shows up on the sarcophagus of Theodosius, at Civi
dale in Italy, from the first half of the eighth century. There
the creature appears to unite in itself the principal species of animals: by its lion’s head and forelimbs, it is a quadruped, a fish by its fins, a reptile by its tail, a bird by its wings (Fig. 1). On the monument which displays it, its image is sculpted on each side of a sort of tree of life, in a posture which recalls the — Fig1 The lion of the sea on an
oriental tapestries of the time of the Bipcentary terial Gide Tal
Sassanids!. Might this depiction perhaps, by a happy excep
tion, signify that the whole animal kingdom draws its life from
the Tree of Life? In the arts of the Middle Ages, and especially in heraldry,
the image of the lion of the sea is more simple, more decora
tive, and less sympathetic than on the tomb of Cividale?; it 339911



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
presents only a lion’s front quarters joined to its fish-shaped
body. In the sixteenth century, the engraver of the works of
Ambroise Paré made it simply a quadruped covered with
scales, a monster who is a “strange beast” but who had no
symbolic meaning?.
By contrast, the manticore is a sort of lion-centaur whom
the Middle Ages regarded as a veritable antithesis to the
Christ-like lion which restores its young to life; for it is an
inexorable destroyer. Its birth in the world of legend goes
back quite far; Aelian, who lived in the third century, says
that Ctesias asserts that there is a very powerful animal in
Asia that resembles a great lion and has three rows of teeth,
which is called Marticoras or Manticoras, that is, one who de
vours men*.
At the end of the thirteenth century, Dante’s teacher Bru
netto Latini described the fabulous creature this way: “The
Manticore is a beast in this land (of India), which has a man’s
face and a blood red complexion, yellow eyes, a lion’s body,
and a scorpion’s tail, and which runs so hard that no beast can
escape it. But above all meats, it loves the flesh of man?.”
Fig. 2 The lion of the sea according to Ambroise Paré, 16th century.
392



THE LION OF THE SEA
And Rabelais completes this frightful portrait by telling us that “Mantichores are very strange beasts: they have a body like a lion, red skin, face and ears like a man, three rows of teeth each one running inside the others as if you interlaced your fingers; in the tail they have a barb with which they sting as scorpions do, and they have an extremely melodious voice®.” The celebrated monster column at the monastery of Souvigny in Bourbonnais, which dates from the twelfth century, bears the image of the infernal lion-centaur, under the name: MANICORA’.

THE HIPPOGRIFF
NA VERY old initiate group in Asia the Sanskrit translation
of St. John’s Apocalypse is regarded as the holiest of scrip
tures, and the horseman in red and his mount as the most sa
cred of all symbols. The rider is designated by the title “He
who is promised on the last day”; the white horse has the
head of an eagle and wings of gold, and flashes of gold issue
from its eyes. This is the hippogriff. It is pictured in full gal
lop on a very ancient Greek ivory discovered in Sparta, and
its image adorns several Greek and Gallic ‘coins. We see it
striking an evil beast with its head, and its spirited action fills
the disk of a Roman lamp found in Poitou” (Fig. 1).

THE HIPPOGRIFF
Fig. 2. The hippogriff on a 12th-century sculpture at the Prieuré du Bas-Nueil-sur-Dive in Vienne.
In the era of Greco-Roman supremacy as well as since, the qualities of the eagle and the horse were joined in the hippogriff, and in Christian symbolism, like its brother the griffin, it is the image of Dante’s “two-natured beast”—the divine and the human natures united hypostatically in the unique Person of Christ. As with the griffin, the quadruped hindquarters represent Christ’s humanity, and the breast, head, and wings of the eagle his divinity. I reproduce here a Roman depiction of the hippogriff from the capital of a twelfth-century pillar in the old chapel of the Benedictine priory at Nueil-sur-Dive, near Loudun, in Vienne (Fig. 2). Images of the hippogriff are much less frequently seen in medieval Christian art than those of the griffin, the unicorn, and the winged horse; it is however quite wrong to suppose, as do some modern encyclopedists, that it was an invention of the fifteenth-century Italian poet Bojardo?, who was the governor of Reggio and was later popularized by the Orlando Furioso of Ariosto. 339955

THE GRIFFIN
ITH THE CENTAUR and the hippogriff, we have introduced the fabulous “biformed” animals, to use Dante’s word—hybrid creatures out of the abyss of time, chosen by Christian symbolists to represent the nature and excellence of Christ; but of these their favorite was the griffin. Some scholars believe that griffins were conceived in the imagination of those Assyrian artists who were such extraordinary portrayers of animals during the twenty centuries preceding our era; or perhaps in some part of Chaldea near Babylon. The griffin is indeed found in the ancient art of these areas. I present here a drawing taken from a Babylonian cylinder seal engraved on _ semiprecious stone, where we see the griffin between Fig. 1 The griffin on a the sacred symbol of the Tree of Life, Babylonian eolinder seal surmounted by the solar globe and the lunar crescent, and a winged spirit attacking with a curved blade! (Fig. 1). A very ancient Chaldean sculpture shows two griffins who have come upon a gazelle; they have exactly the same aspect that has come down to us through the centuries*. The lintel of the entrance door to the palace of the Assyrian king Sennacherib, seven centuries before Christ, was decorated with two griffins drinking from a vessel placed between them?. The myth of the griffin was also known to the Persians at what was cer
tainly an even earlier time; I reproduce here the beautiful 339977



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
head of this animal found on the banks of the Araxes at Persepolis* (Fig. 2). In the fifth century before our era, the Greek Ctesias who was mentioned before, the physician to King Artaxerxes of Persia, believed in the existence of griffins inhabiting some far-distant place which he deFig. 2 Bronze head of ascribes as four-legged birds the size of griffin; from Persepolis. wolves, whose backs were covered with black feathers and their breasts with red ones’. Ancient Indian art certainly recognized the griffin, before and at the beginning of our era, and made use of its image®.
Modern scholars think that the Orient borrowed it from very
ancient Greece, and that it must have reached Asia by means
of the art of Cyprus, which would have received it from My
cenae’. Sir Arthur Evans says that in Greece this kind of hybrid animal goes back at least as far as the sixteenth century before Christ’. In Crete, in the rediscovered palace of King Minos at Knossos, on each side of the throne, huge griffins lie in fields of lilies, which were the Fig. 3 The griffin among emblematic flower of the Cretan royalty?
the lilies; in the palace of (Fig 3).
Minos:at Kaossos The soil of Greece has yielded metal griffins of very archaic appearance!®, as for instance in Schliemann’s excavations at Mycenae; and the griffin’s image is
seen on some beautiful Greek coins. Pliny describes the
“griphis” with his customary richness of fancy and declares
they come from the country of the Scythians, that is, northern
Russia!!, while Aeschylus locates them among the Ethiopians!?. “Like all that legion of monstrous animals depicted in ori
ental art,” says Dom Leclercq, “the griffin was not a simple
flight of fancy; it had a symbolic significance, and played a re
ligious role!3.” This is certainly true; but we do not know
what different meanings it was given in the ancient East: the 398



THE GRIFFIN
Babylonian cylinder seal reproduced above shows it as an evildoer, as Satan, the adversary of the Tree of Life; but who can say what celestial liquor, what divine soma of apotheosis the griffins were drinking from the sacred vessel in the palace of Sennacherib? Then again, the griffins guarding the throne of the Cretan rulers at Knossos could only have had a positive connotation—however mysterious the diversity of these regions and of the religious and symbolic ideas of their inhabitants. In any case, in the earliest civilizations griffins usually represented some of the allegorical meanings of the lion and the eagle, equally kings of earth and air, whose natures they shared. In Greece and Rome, the best known role in which the griffin was cast by religious thought was that of guardian of tombs!4. Part of a second- or third-century Gallo-Roman sarcophagus, showing Greek influence, found at Vertou (Lower Loire)!>, shows one of the most magnificent of the known images of the funerary griffin (Fig. 4). There is another on the two Christian sarcophagi at Arles, in Provence!®, on one at
Nimes!’, etc.
Another concept made the griffin, among the Greeks, an animal of light. This explains why it sometimes sits at the
feet of statues of Apollo, and
why two griffins flank the Fig. 4 2nd- or 3rd-century fimerary
statue of the god in his temple wre foe ee at Delos!8. An old coin from Smyrna has on one face the
head of Apollo crowned with laurel, and on the reverse side a crouching female griffin with its paw on the solar wheel!®. In consequence of this dedication to Apollo, the god of
light and beauty, the griffin represented to the Ancients poetic
inspiration, which carries the mind far from the common 339999



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
things of this world, as in the griffin the winged foreparts of
the eagle lift the heavy hindquarters of the lion?°. Sometimes
also we see the griffin’s image not at the foot of the god’s
statue but on his lyre itself2!. It remains to be seen whether
this aspect of animal of light was not in fact borrowed by the
Greeks from oriental fables: the griffin drinks flame from the
cup of the fire altar in archaic Persian and Assyrian art. The
scholar Schliemann says that some ancient writers claimed
that the Hindus believed griffins to be hitched to the Sun’s
chariot??.
But it was not only by pure light and poetry that the
Greeks connected the griffin to Phoebus-Apollo; they re
garded it also, according to Herodotus, as the vigilant and in
vincible guardian of the god’s treasures,
and on a higher plane, “the guardian
also of the ways of salvation’?
(Fig, 5).”
It would seem that the griffin, en
dowed with such a wealth of symbolism
of a high order, must have been
adopted from the beginning by Chris
tian symbolism. It was not so, however.
The griffin is not included among the
animals pictured in the catacombs, and when it appears on
some fourth- and fifth-century Christian lamps, it seems to be
with an evil aspect. It was not until the coming of the Middle
Ages that the symbolism of the griffin was definitely con
nected with Christ and his saints; at this time the learned
monks revived the forgotten legend of griffins carrying aloft
Alexander the Great, and this scene was sculptured in clois
ters and in the stone decorations of great churches. Here is
the story of Alexander’s ascension, translated from an old
French text of the period: “The soldiers of the great king Al
exander came upon a strange deserted country called Sixtus.
In this land lived huge and hideous birds called griffins. The
king had several of these attached to a cabin of wood and

new leather which he had had built and in which he took his place. He then raised above the cabin a piece of meat attached to the point of his lance, and immediately the griffins rose in the air, drawing Alexander upward as he pointed his lance. He ascended to the heaven of fire, where the excessive heat at last forced him to descend, which he accomplished by lowering his lance?+.”” According to other, better known authors, he captured two griffins and made them go without food for three days; then he attached them to the two sides of his throne, and lifted above their heads two long lances carrying roast meat on their points; the hungry griffins took flight trying to reach their prey and flew upward thus for seven days, carrying Alexander to God’s dwelling. He would have crossed the threshold were it not for an angel who said to him: “O king, why do you wish to know what pertains to heaven, when you do not yet know what is of earth?” The king recognized his presumptuousness, lowered the lances, and the griffins brought him back to our

ees Ancient Persia attributed a similarly presumptuous undertaking to King Kai Kaous, who made use of giant eagles whose flight carried him to what heights only God knows, for he was never seen again*®. The ascension of Alexander was represented in the twelfth century particularly in Italy in the cathedrals of Otranto and of St. Mark’s in Venice?7; it is also seen in Basel (Fig. 6), in Freiburg, etc., and in France in several towns, especially in Mans and Thouars in Poitou. In thus depicting the griffins lifting Alexander to heaven, medieval art clearly intended to make this king, in spite of the 440011



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
failure of his audacious enterprise, the image of the soul car
tied toward heaven by the eagle-lion creature; moreover, in so
doing it was in perfect agreement with ancient art and ideas.
In the center of a painted stucco ceiling on the Via Latina in
Rome, a veiled figure, which can only be the soul of a dead
person, is carried up toward the sky by a griffin psycha
gogue?®. In ancient Egypt, the griffin, called Sefer, trans
formed itself into the burnt offerings of the sacrifices, and by
means of their smoke carried toward heaven the souls of the
dead for whom the sacrifices had been made??. As we have
said, medieval Christian mysticism saw emblems of Jesus
Christ in all the animals who in pre-Christian symbolism car
ried souls upward, especially in connection with the symbolism
of the eagle.
Emile Male has given the following explanation of the me
dieval depictions of Alexander's legend: “Alexander,” he said,
“is human pride, human knowledge that tries to snatch God’s
secrets from him. Man ascends, he boldly enters the place of
mysteries, but it is a limitless region, and at last he is forced to stop in front of new mysteries.”
It is indeed very likely that in the Middle Ages some minds
understood in this way the legend of Alexander and the
griffins; but the interpretation which makes the griffin one of
the symbolic animals who lift souls to God is also in full
agreement with Christian symbolism, because it is in harmony
with the attachment of the psychagogic role to the eagle, the
falcon, the panther, the winged horse, etc., on the same pre
Christian bases.
Joining in itself the two natures of eagle and lion, the
griffin is one of the most satisfactory emblems of Christ's dual
nature. “Aquila, Christus... Leo, Christus,” says the Clavis at
tributed to St. Melito?°. Similarly to other hybrid creatures,
the eagle foreparts depict Christ’s divinity and the lion hind
quarters his humanity?!. Dante and the mystics of his time
accepted this Christ-symbolism in the griffin, and thus pre
sented “the double-natured animal,” the “biformed beast” 402



THE GRLEFPIN

whose “wings stretched beyond human sight”: the members of the eagle-shaped part of its body were golden, and those of the lion part were white mixed with purple*?. And the beautiful animal which pulled the symbolic chariot was greeted by the great poet in the following words:
Blest art thou, Gryphon, that with beak and bite Thou tearest naught from this sweet-tasting wood? Seeing how ill the belly gripest from it**.
Alchemists, who have taken the griffin as the symbol of the “chemical hermaphrodite, sulphur and mercury,” recognize that “Catholic commentators have chosen to see the symbol of Jesus Christ, God and Man, in the double nature of the griffin? (fig. 7).” Its aquiline-leonine body makes it also the symbol of two of the four elements, earth and air, and thus of the two kingdoms of Christ, heaven and earth. The Ancients looked upon their beautiful animal of light also as one of the signs of wisdom, which is the highest light of the mind, and in this way again it represents Christ. It is in
this aspect that the griffin appears on the shield carried by
Wisdom personified on the north door of the thirteenth
century cathedral of Chartres*®. 4038
403



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
From another angle, because the
eagle and the lion are both strong
creatures and consequently nothing can stop the griffin in its powerful
flight or its irresistible charge, the
hermetic symbolists made it represent Christ’s power (Fig. 8). In accor

Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris. age of the griffin shows also the text
from St. Luke: “But he passing through the midst of them
went his way 27.” A talismanic potency was attributed to this
gospel text in the Middle Ages, as witness King Charles V’s
fine cameo, at Chartres, and certain coins from Brabant?®. It
was said also that arrows shot from bows made of the griffin’s
big wing-feathers were irresistible in their flight??.
Because of this symbolic connection with Christ’s invincible
power and the magical protection proceeding from it, the
credulity of the times sought for what it believed to be
“griffins’ eggs,” without pausing to consider that that part of
the animal that would normally contain the organs of mater
nity was that of a quadruped and not of an egg-bearer. Not
withstanding this detail, people of rank had such eggs richly
mounted as cups, which were considered (like vases of
pseudo-unicorn’s horn) to make the beverages they contained
particularly healthful. Without going into the question of what
large exotic birds these eggs might have come from, I shall
only say that from the twelfth to the sixteenth century they
were highly prized, especially in England where they were
called “grypeseye*®.” They are mentioned in the inventories of princely and noble houses.
The imagination of the ancient world established dragons
and griffins as the guardians of hidden treasures; griffins were
especially the custodians of the most beautiful and precious of
colored jewels, the emerald. At the end of the fifteenth cen
tury, Toannes de Cuba said that the finest emeralds were those 404



THE GRIFFIN
taken from the nest of griffins who guard them “with great cruelty4!.”” And his editor, Philippe Le Noir, in 1539, accompanied this text with a woodcut which shows the griffin arriving at its nest (a bird’s nest!) where its little ones are nestling on top of the emerald (Fig. 9). Medieval Christian symbolism adopted the old fable of the griffin and the emerald. Among the concepts which it added to it we only know that, as rubies were taken to symbolize Christ’s blood, the emerald was also connected to the symbol
Fig. 9 The griffin and its nest, its young, and the emerald. From the Hortus Sanitatis.
ism of the redeeming blood because, it was said, the cup in which Jesus blessed the wine at the Last Supper, saying “this is my blood,” was made of an enormous carved emerald. This is the Holy Grail of our forefathers, which the epic of the Round Table says was made from an emerald that fell from Lucifer’s brow at the moment of his rebellion. It is also the Holy Cup of Genoa, unquestionably ancient, but made in green molten glass which was long thought to be emerald. The griffin was the symbolic image of the saints, thanks 440055



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
again to its double nature; because the saints are eagles on
account of the high regions where their thoughts and affec
tions dwell, and lions on account of the moral courage which
they prove in the battle between good and evil. Tradition has
it that in the year 509, King Clovis found himself at Moissac
and conceived the desire to establish a church there where
monks could celebrate the holy rites. The night following this
decision, the king dreamed he saw two griffins holding stones
in their beaks and carrying them to a neighboring valley. And
in this valley Clovis had a church and an abbey built*?. The
hagiological legend says that the two griffins represented the
two monks who were to become the two first abbots of Moissac, St. Amand and St. Ausbert*?. Along the same lines, the artists who decorated the ancient
Byzantine cathedral in Athens, about the ninth or tenth cen
tury, carved on the facade two griffins eating the fruit of the
Tree of Life. Now, this tree and its fruit are only for the
saints, according to the inspired text which the Church has
made its own: “To him that overcometh will I give to eat of
the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of
God*4.”
Here we must return to the scene of griffins drinking from
a mysterious cup, and look at it this time as simply as did the
medieval Christian folk in France. Surely, along with Dom
Leclercq who spoke for the Merovingian epoch, with Charles
Cahier*® and Emile Méale*®, we must recognize that the
griffins drinking from a cup are a decorative subject directly
inspired by oriental religious motifs having nothing to do with
Christianity. To be even more exact, we shall say that this was
a twelfth-century copy, in French Romanesque style, of a dec
orative motif imported from upper Lebanon and northern Syria by the crusaders and other travelers. It is, in fact, the chalice of the Mazdean fire altar from which drink birds, lions, griffins, and dragons; it can be seen in embroideries, in
jewelry, on the metal dishes imported in such quantities from
the Orient in this period. But in religious art, on the capitals 406



THE GRIFFIN
of pillars and the ornamental brackets of our Romanesque churches, for instance, the people of that time, who interpreted everything in accordance with the ideas of their faith, could not have seen anything else, in the griffins who quenched their thirst in the chalice, but holy souls asking for the grace necessary for earthly life from the sacrament of Christ’s eucharistic blood. In the symbolic iconography of the Middle Ages, the griffin, with its rapacious beak and the huge claws of a predator, often symbolized Satan; the three bestiaries studied by Charles Cahier*” speak of it only under this name, which seems to suit it well, especially in those images of it which show it with a dragon-like rear ending in a reptile’s tail (Fig. 10). It is surely on account of this satanic character in contemporary symbolism that formerly in the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris there was hung like a trophy what was supposed to be a griffin’s paw; that of some big predator. It was said that a
knight who had vanquished the animal — Fig. 10 The griffim-dragon

the royal chapel as an ex-voto of- coat-of-arms.
fering*8. But all the heraldists recognized that the griffin, noble in both its aerial and terrestrial natures, often represented Christ on coats-of-arms*?. This is especially the case when it serves as “allusive arms” (those which suggest a play upon the bearer’s name or title) for great families: for example, the Griffa in the kingdom of Naples, the Griffen in Silesia*®, the Griffon in Saintonge and Poitou®!. When a heraldic figure
takes on the function of “allusive arms,” it always carries the noblest meaning that can be attributed to it, which also then contributes to the luster of the owner’s family name.
In other cases, the griffin means the alliance of speed and 440077



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
vigilance with strength and courage*?. Elsewhere, especially in the armorial bearings of cities, the griffin takes back its old significance as incorruptible guardian. But in the medieval religious heraldry and sigillography (the study of seals), when the griffin appears alone it must be regarded as the image of Jesus Christ, God and man. The “griffin-dragon” of heraldry, which is opposed to the usual “griffin-lion,” and whose body ends like that of a reptile, always represents an abominable enemy—in a word, Evil.

THE DRAGON
HE DRAGON OF contemporary naturalists, draco fimbriatus, TT: only a little reptile no more than thirty-five centimeters long, which lives on the coasts and islands of Malaysia, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Celebes (now Sulawesi). It has membranes attached to both its flanks which act as a parachute when it leaps into space from a tree or a high rock (Fig. 1). But it is not this harmless little creature that concerns us here. If one reads the accounts of the first teachers of the Christian doctrine, it would seem that in the first thousand years of Christianity, “dragon” meant only the accursed dragon of Hebrew scripture and of St. John’s Revelation!—a fabulous animal that seems to have sprung from an exaggeration of the crocodile, well before the time of King David. It was not until later, during the Middle Ages, that the Nile hydra was represented as a veritable small dragon, some
times with wings?. But at the same time there arose in certain
particularly fertile imaginations a belief in the existence of an: other, different sort of Nile hydra, with a beneficent nature. - Old memories from classical ‘times supported this notion: the - Ancients had spoken of dragonlike beings well-disposed to hu: mans, and Suetonius said that the Fig.7 ‘The dhagow of'the soulbern dragon is “of divine essence,”
coasts of Indo-China. Divus Draco. This kindly spirit 410

THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
that the sap received the fabled name which was then passed
on to the tree that produced it and which was unknown to the
Ancients’.”
This is a very judicious statement; the dragon’s-blood that
the Ancients collected came, without their knowledge, from
the dried fruits of different palm trees, especially the fruit of
the calamus draco, growing on the banks of the Persian Gulf
and in the basin of the Erythrian Sea, Hindustan, and Indo
China. Dragon’s-blood is also produced by the dracoema draco
of the Canaries and the Azores, and by the pterocarpus draco
of the West Indies and South America, regions that were
known to Nicolas Monardes. Pliny, for his part, as we shall
see in the next chapter on the basilisk, attributes a magical
power very similar to that of dragon’s-blood to the blood of the basilisk, the dragon-cock.
It might be added that a careful study of the heraldry of
the nobility of this epoch and its later developments® indicates
that the dragon did not always play a villainous role on the
armorial bearings, but sometimes represented vigilance, and
also ardor; for it was said that the dragon “goes to battle like
an impetuous torrent sweeping down from the mountains” and
that from its lungs issues a breath so fiery that “it sets the air
ablaze’.”
Another concept of the dragon, which seems to have arisen
in the Far East well before Christian times, is one which con
nects it with the divine Word, as in the Egyptian religion the
ibis was related to the “Word of Creation.” This idea was
probably familiar to the ancient Christian communities of
Syria, upper Armenia, and the more eastern Nestorian cen
ters, for communications between the Near and Far East in
the first thousand years of the Christian era were much more
frequent than is generally imagined®; and it was a current no
tion in the regions that are now known as Khorassan,
Afghanistan, and the Punjab. At the present time, in Lamaism
and Indo-Tibetan Buddhism the dragon is still looked upon as
the symbol of life and the divine Word, the creative and pre- 412



THE DRAGON
serving utterance of life on earth®. “The dragon,” says René Guénon, “was the ancient Far Eastern symbol of the Word, but it awakes only ‘diabolic’ associations in the minds of modern westerners!°.” In Burma and the provinces of the neighboring Blue River Valley, the dragon is represented in its creative aspect as expelling from its mouth the flood of the first waters which contained the Fish, symbol of life on earth; and without doubt, this function of its mouth connects it with the Word of God the Creator. All the people on earth who have had faith in one supreme divinity, the creator of all the worlds and the life upon them, have worshipped the allpowerful utterance which declared throughout space the laws which rule the gravitation of these worlds and the germs of life developing upon them. The Word of Creation to the pontiffs of Egypt, the Logos to the Greeks, the mouth of Ogmios to the Druids of Gaul, the voice of God or the uncre- 5 ated speech to the lamas of Fig.2. The sacred Great Dragon Tibet and the bonzes of China of China, protector of the Emperors and Indo-China; whatever it sg ees framigd Dre may be, the divine Word—however poorly known, ill-defined, or badly served—remains no less the Word of God which was in the beginning, without which nothing would have been made, and which is the very light and life of men!!. For the Christian, all homage, all worship, directed toward the divine Word rises directly to Christ, the eternal Word of the Father, as anything thrown into space, in spite of itself goes straight
to its true center of gravity.

THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
In Annam, as the emblem of power, the dragon depicts
the person of the emperor (Fig. 2); it is also the guardian of
hidden treasures!2. It might be added that in regions such as
India and Tibet, the dragon is often looked upon as a psycha
gogue, since it is on its wings or its back that the souls of the
holy ascetics are lifted and carried toward the Compassionate
One after the death of their bodies. It is thus that the blessed
soul of Milarepa departed from this world into the immensity
of bliss.
It is an historical certainty that the first apostles of Chris
tianity in China did not anathematize the image of the dragon
of the region, for at the top of the Christian monument at
Jinxian which was raised in 1625, a sort of crowning cupola
surmounting the cross is held up by two dragons!’.
The Chinese see the sacred image of the dragon nearly
everywhere—in the vines enlacing the tree trunks, in the foam
of waterfalls, in clouds, in the smoke of funeral pyres and in
that of their cooking pots!*. Among these many dragons,
some are good spirits, others are fearsome and maleficent.
They become, as Father Doré says, hopelessly confused. The
greatest of them all “is a mysterious, supernatural creature,
the reptile-spirit specifically designated in Chinese books as
the Dragon above all others.” This Great Dragon, it is said,
appears only in extraordinary circumstances, and in particular
marked the reign of the very early, perhaps legendary, em
peror Fu Xi, who claimed it made frequent personal appear
ances which exerted great influence for his governing
policies!®. The image of the Great Dragon in China is like
the symbol of sovereign nobility and divine power; that is why
it is embroidered on the emperor’s coat and tunic, and often
is shown as the mount of gods and goddesses. Above all the
cult is related to the prosperity of the ruler and of his people.
The secondary dragons were divided into four families by
the religious learned men of China: (1) dragons that rise into
the sky; (2) dragon-spirits; (3) terrestrial dragons that cannot
rise into the sky; and (4) underground dragons that guard 414



THE DRAGON
hidden treasures and precious substances buried in the ground. The liturgy of the secondary dragons is extremely complex and its principal ceremonies are practiced to obtain rain or fine weather, or good crops of grain and fruit, and lead to the traditional annual “Growth Ceremony” (Fig. 3).
Petitions for successful stock-raising and for all material goods are also part of this cult!® In all that Father Doré recounts of the draconic traditions in China, there is nothing which connects the dragon clearly with the creating and preserving Word. It is true that he speaks only incidentally of the high points of Chinese theology, and more especially of the simple superstitions of the people. He does say however that the dragon “is the active
principle of yin, or in other words, it is the yang of the yin!’.”As is generally known, the An Liang (dark-light) or Tai-ji (great ultimate) of central Asia and China is composed of two cosmic principles, masculine and feminine, yang and yin, which are complementary and necessary for all activity and all life in the whole universe. Certainly this idea can be related to that of Chris- ig. 3 Talismanic image of the Chinese tian theology, of the Spirit PT eas era creating and animating the world, of the creative and preserving Utterance of life, the divine Word!8, Very old stories often describe the dragon as jealously
guarding immense treasures in inaccessible caves, or on
mountain peaks surrounded by precipices, which can be reached only by one dangerous path, full of pitfalls. In other legends, the dragon guards the entrance of a paradise that
contains happiness, the most precious and fragile treasure of
all. To taste it, or to possess the riches of any of these fantastic storehouses, a man must put to death the guardian mon
ster; thus Hercules had to fight and conquer the dragon 441155



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
keeping the gate of the garden of the
Hesperides where grew the golden apples’
of felicity. The blade reddened with the
blood of the guardian of these places is
thus the key that allows one to enter.
For centuries and up till now, groups
based on initiatic principles have kept the
i . Fig. 4 The infernal winged dragon,
symbol of the defending dragon, and his from a 14thecentury mansript
title of “Guardian of the threshold” has
passed into their vocabulary. It is the figurative death of this
guardian-dragon which allows access to the Holy of Holies of
the group, and participation in its life and secrets.
To the ordinary thought of the majority of Christians now
adays, the dragon stands for Satan, the spirit of evil, king of
hell, and for nothing else (Fig. 4). This opinion, which leaves
out too much of the ancient symbolism, conforms however
with that of the medieval bestiaries!®, and is based on scrip
tural texts such as that about
the Babylonian dragon-idol
which Daniel destroyed?° (Fig.
5), and the Apocalypse of St.
John: “..and behold a great
red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven
crowns upon his heads. And his
tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast
them to the earth: and the
dragon stood before the woman
which was ready to be delivered,
for to devour her child as soon
as it was born...2!” And St.
John adds that this great
dragon, this “old serpent” is indeed he who is “called the De

resentations of the conquered dragons were carried in solemn
processions. Immediately following the cross in the pro
cessional order, these dragon-images symbolized Satan con
quered and following his conqueror, as the enemy kings in the
Roman triumphs followed with bound hands the chariot of the victorious Caesar. According to Eusebius, it was with this image of van
quished paganism that the emperor Constantine had himself
represented on foot, piercing with his lance a bristling
dragon2*, And with a similar thought, medieval artists sometimes placed a serpent, sometimes a conquered dragon, under
the foot of the Virgin Mary, as an echo of the biblical curse:
“She shall crush thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for her
heel?>.” : In the Salle de Baouit in the Louvre museum, there is an
astonishing and very fine Egypto-Roman sculpture represent
ing the god Horus, on horseback and dressed like a Roman
legionnaire, who tramples under his horse’s feet and pierces
with his lance the Typhonian crocodile, one of the Egyptian symbols of evil. 418

THE BASILISK
HE BASILISK IS shown in medieval Christian art so often that we must take a moment to examine its legend and its monstrous image. Following Linnaeus, naturalists gave the
name of basilisk to several kinds of medium-sized saurians
chiefly inhabiting America and naturally having nothing to do
with the famous basilisk of the Ancients, who designated with
the name basilikos, “the royal one,” a snake whose head car
ried a row of scales placed in the shape of a crown. Charles
Cahier thinks that this historic basilisk is the uraeus of the
Egyptians, the viper Haje!, whose sacred image guarded both
the sun’s golden disk and the crowned forehead of the phar
aoh; and Horapollo, writing in the fourth century of our era, was of the same opinion?. On a Roman lamp of this pe
riod, Christ is represented standing with the accursed beasts
beneath his feet, and among them the basilisk in the shape of
the viper-asp?. That coincides with the theory of Pliny, who
describes the basilisk of Cyrenaica as a small snake with a
white spot shaped like a crown on its head. He also states
that the basilisk’s breath kills shrubs, burns the grass, and
breaks stones, and that the horseman who kills it with his lance dies also, and his horse as well, because the basilisk’s
venom flows back up the shaft of the lance...and he adds:
“Nevertheless, this fearsome monster cannot resist weasels; this is nature’s law: everything has its counterbalance*.”” The Egyptians made the basilisk, their uraeus, symbolize
the idea of eternity, says Horapollo, because “it is a member 420



THE BASILISK
of the only race of serpents that do not die.”” He adds that the basilisk “with nothing but its breath, strikes dead any other animal, without even touching or biting it®.” Because of this terrifying faculty, several nations of former times, where this was talked of, saw in the basilisk the ruinous power of evil. From the time of David, the basilisk was considered one of the four monsters who reflect this evil power: the asp, the basilisk, the lion, and the dragon, which the future Messiah must triumphantly crush beneath his feet: “Thou shalt walk upon the asp and the basilisk, and thou shalt trample underfoot the lion and the dragon®.” Isaiah is even more explicit. In the first chapters of his prophecy he announces two mysterious future events: the coming of the Messiah, lord and principle of good: “And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots: And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him...”” The other event is the appearance of the accursed Antichrist, the lord of all evil: “out of the serpent’s root shall come forth a cockatrice [basilisk] and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent [dragon]}®.” Among the pre-Christian peoples of the Mediterranean basin, the basilisk was in no better repute: some among them, says Pierius, declared it was born from an egg which was formed in the body of a very old ibis from the concentrated venom of all the snakes swallowed by the bird during its lifetime?. Pliny sums up thus the Greek and Roman legends on this subject: “As for the basilisk, which even serpents flee from, which kills by its odor alone... its blood has been greatly celebrated by the sages; this hardens like resin, and is of the same color; when water is added to it, it becomes redder than cinnamon. It is said to have the power to cure maladies and to prevent evil spells. Some call it the blood of Saturn!°.” In Assyria, the god of war, Nergal, a mythic being more ferocious than the Greek Ares or the Roman Mars, was shown as a more or less dragon-like cock, which Eliphas Lévi 442211



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
(without identifying the piece of ancient art that was his au
thority for it) has depicted as a medieval basilisk, both cock and snake!! (Fig. 1).
The cock itself was often the image of the Savior, but the
basilisk, combining cock and snake, was quite the opposite.
After having been the sign of Evil and Death in pre-Christian
cults, in Christian iconography the basilisk became the em
blem of Satan. This mythical creature had a cock’s body end
ing in the tail of a lizard or a snake, like the caladre!? which
expresses an entirely different idea. Christian
symbolism made use of all the earlier fables
about the basilisk to make it the image of
the Spirit of Evil, and the authors of besti
aties and similar works in the Middle Ages
added still more to what has formerly been
attributed to it. The Dominican Vincent de
Beauvais, who wrote in the reign of St.
Louis!3, concludes thus: “It is reliably said that the cock, when it becomes very old, lays
an egg, out of itself (‘facit ovum ex se!*), and that under certain conditions the basilisk is hatched from this marvelous egg. When the egg is laid in a manure heap, with the
help of the heat generated there, after a very long time a little animal emerges... This animal has a tail like a viper and the rest of its body is like a cock. Some writers say that this egg
has no shell, but a kind of skin that is so tough that it cannot be torn even with the most violent effort. Others say that the
egg is hatched by a viper and an owl, but that does not seem
assured. The writings of the Ancients limit themselves to af
firming that there exists a kind of basilisk that is engendered from the egg of an old cock!>.” The Florentine Brunetto Latini, who was a contemporary of
Vincent de Beauvais, adds a detail not mentioned by the lat
ter: that through its eyes, the basilisk discharges waves of its

Nergal, from Eliphas Lévi.

THE BASILISK
inner poison so powerfully destructive that with its look alone it kills whatever human or beast it sees!®. Some medieval artists emphasized this characteristic of terrifying malignity which their times attributed to the basilisk by representing the creature with eyes at the tip of its tail which sometimes ends in a serpent’s head—which meant that it was thus equipped to see and to deal out death both before and behind. A Romanesque capital in the cathedral of Mans provides an example in sculpture of this hyperbolic symbolism!7.
Fig. 2. The basilisk; a 13th-century sculpture Fig. 3 The basilisk; 12th-century sculpture from the Poitiers cathedral. from the abbey church of Vézelay.
The half-cock, half-snake basilisk is seen not only in the sculpture of the great cathedrals such as those of Mans, of Amiens, Sens!8, and Poitiers!®, or of abbeys such as Vézelay (Figs. 2 & 3), but also in numerous rural churches, so popular in former times was this symbolism. The little country church of Claunay, near Loudun, in Vienne, contains a Romanesque capital decorated with the image of a knight on foot striking a helmeted basilisk with his sword. It is the struggle between Good and Evil, so often and variously depicted, and could be seen as Christ fighting with Satan. But the local legend, ignoring a flagrant anachronism, chooses to see in it the image of the valiant knight Frettard, the lord of
Claunay, who in 1350 drove away the English from Loudun 442283



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
where they had been laying siege for three months to the town’s impregnable fortress. The legend says that on returning to his manor house of Turzay in Claunay, he went in to the church to give thanks to God for his victory, and on leaving it, whom should he meet outside the door but Satan in the form of an armed basilisk, barring his passage. A terrible fight ensued which lasted till morning, during which the knight
Fig. 4 Capital of a pillar in the church Frettard forced the monster
at Véniers, in Vienne. to retreat, step by step, for three leagues, to the courtyard of his house at Coulaines-enMouterre; just as they arrived there, one of the barnyard
cocks greeted the first light of dawn with his ringing voice. At this sound, the basilisk suddenly gave way completely and hurled itself into the well of Coulaines. Only once every ten years is it permitted during the night to come up to the well’s curbstone. It is clear that even when the popular imagination deflects these legends of the satanic cock from their mystical meanings, in the remote countrysides of France they remain within the context of the old themes expressed by the religious writ
ers of the Middle Ages. I have lingered over the Claunay legend because it presents so well both the satanic character with which the basilisk was popularly endowed and that of the guardian who frightens away nocturnal demons and monsters,
which is attributed by a tradition many thousands of years old to the voice of the basilisk’s virtuous antithesis, the cock, saluting the dawn. A curious capital from the very last period of Romanesque 424



THE BASILISK
art, which is in the church at Veniers, near Loudun, ex
presses a very different theme from that of the basilisk, showing the foreparts of a cock attached to the body of a bull (Fig. 4). Should we see in this hieroglyph the union of intelligence and of courageous strength, the one guiding the other? Possibly so, for in Christian symbolism the cock—when it does not
represent the Christian, or on
the other hand a _ viceeverywhere remains one of
Fig. 5 12th-century Romanesque capital at Mans. . :
i the symbols of intelligence because of the sacred text which bears on it: Quis dedit gallo intelligentiam? “Who gave the cock understanding??®” But in the basilisk, this precious faculty is placed at the service of evil. The hybrid creature at Veniers however is not necessarily one of the servants of the Evil Spirit. The basilisk also sometimes symbolized the perverted Christian who stops at nothing; this is doubtless the meaning of the capital in the cathedral of Mans where two basilisks, in the words of St. Paul, drink “their own damnation” from the chalice (Fig. 5). And this allegory, evoking the sacrilegious communion, is the opposite of the theme of the capital in Henri Aymard’s collection, where two cocks drink from the cup of life. In the Kabbalah, the basilisk is the mount of the infernal angel Azazel, because this monster kills not only with its look but with the germs of the pestilences and contagious maladies it carries?!.

HE OUROBOROS IS a snake curled in a complete circle Tend holding the end of its tail in its mouth; thus its name, for in Greek oura signifies “tail,” and boros means “devouring,” or “that which devours.” Hence the Greek word ouroboros and the Greco-Latin ourovorax which is used by some
writers.
The ancient Greeks borrowed this symbol from the Egyptians who had connected it, according to Olympiodorus and Plutarch, with planetary movements, and had given it various metaphysical meanings that in the process of centuries have widened considerably. After the Romans, various Christian and heretical sects, such as the Gnostics and the Ophites, adopted it with added meanings that we do not know with exactitude. During the height of the Middle Ages and thereafter, even up to the present time, the practitioners of alchemy, hermetism, and then of religious heraldry and that of the nobility held it
sacred.
The most familiar of the meanings given the ouroborus by
the Ancients is that which associates it with Time—time,
which alone with God has had no beginning, and will have no
end since it is the thread on which eternity is woven. The
ouroboros also, curved in a circle, joining together the two
ends of its body with the pressure of its jaws, makes an un- A427

broken whole; reuniting in itself the beginning and the end, it comes to possess the essence of the eternal!. The Egyptians invented divisions in the starry and planetary movements that give us our times and seasons, in a way which allows us to measure the irresistible flow of time”, or as Virgil calls it, its “irreparable flight.” However, it seems that the original meaning of the ouroboros symbol related primarily to cyclic perpetuity, this inescapable, orderly renewal of
cycles whose uninterrupted succession constitutes eternity.
Probably to the Ancients these renewals were represented by the snake’s characteristic of periodically changing its skin; for it was thought that in thus creating a new skin, the reptile also renewed its life. As Tertullian explains it, the snake “changes its skin and its natural age. As soon as it is aware of the approach of old age, it shuts itself into a narrow passageway and at that moment drops its wrinkled skin, and, stripped of itself, leaves its hole shining and rejuvenated?.” Classical mythology and its iconography made the ouroboros an attribute of Saturn, the son of Coelus, who represented time and was called Kronos by the Greeks. He was shown as an old man holding a scythe in his right hand, and in the other, the ouroboros, because in the succession of the years, the last month of each joins the first month of the next, like the tail and the head of the circular serpent. It is from this aspect that we see the kinship of this symbol with the image of Janus, under whose skull are joined the two figures of the future and the past which show the profile of an adolescent and that of an old man*. Eternity dwells in their perpetual union. On another plane, philosophers such as Alcmaeon” have applied the ouroboros emblem not only to the cyclic perpetuity of time but also to that of the human soul. The second meaning of this emblem among the Ancients was that of symbolizing movement, and the continuous force which activates it—not only because its circular form can roll like a wheel or a child’s hoop, but especially because the snake, in its natural state, not having the limbs to propel it 428



THE OUROBOROS
with which other animals are endowed, nevertheless moves as
they do, and with great speed, simply by means of the inner action of its flanks and of its ventral plates, an action producing a series of lateral and forward undulations. This inner power of self-propulsion caused the Egyptians to take the serpent as the image of cosmic movement, of the procession of the stars through space and consequently of the course of time and the uninterrupted succession of its phases. It was surely when envisaging it in its circular form that Plutarch said of the snake that the Egyptians compared it with the heavenly bodies®. When the sacred uraeus, the viper Haje, coils itself in a circle on the falcon head of Ra or of Horus, the rising sun, it represents the sun’s daily setting forth and return on its dazzling course; however, in this case the head and tail of the sacred asp emerge from the line of the circle, and it is no longer strictly the ouroboros (Fig. 1).

But we find it again sometimes, in spite of the passage of cen
turies, on sundials of relatively recent date, where it imprisons
within its circle the hours marking the sun’s course. Here is a slate dial, dated 1625, whose inscription reminds the human being how little his life can resist the action of time, measured
by these hours: Memento quia pulvis es: “Remember that thou art dust!” (Fig. 2). It seems that we have now good authority to believe that in 442299



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
some places in the ancient world, the ouroboros also represented the circulation of blood in the human body. This movement, which is a flux and reflux, would in that case have been recognized long before the time of Harvey (1578-1658), who explained its mechanism better than anyone had done before. The symbol’s most esoteric meaning comes from a notion cherished by the Ancients that “the serpent enjoys an unrivaled longevity; it is rejuvenated by growing old, and reborn in itself at the moment it attains its full growth and should begin to decline”.” In fact, as its name indicates that it feeds on its own flesh (Boros-oura, “it devours its tail”), it is with the substance of itself that the serpent renews itself, according to the old fable, in the measure in which it is depleted by the force of time and events. In some provinces, our French peasants say that if one cuts a snake in two, between the end of its tail and the vital organs, the part that is destroyed will grow again and re-create itself as it was before. I do not know if this is true of snakes but it is certainly so with saurians, such as the wall lizard. Thus the Ancients could believe in the existence of a vital and rebuilding principle in the tail of reptiles that the serpent would absorb and assimilate, to procure its own longevity, by biting into the tip of its tail. This capacity of self-restoration made the ouroboros the symbol in the ancient world of the perpetual renewal of life, “the eternal beginning again of everything®.” The philosophy and symbolism of former times looked upon the circle as the image of the universe, of the infinite cosmos which includes divinity and all its works. And since the world’s oldest myths made the serpent, like the dragon (which is itself a huge, hybrid serpent), the natural guardian of all kinds of treasure, the scholars of the time connected the name of the ouroboros snake with another Greek word ouros which means all at once “the guardian of a storehouse,” “the savior,” and “the leader”; and the circle’s representation of in
finity came to include the idea of the circular serpent enclos- 430



THE OUROBOROS
ing everything within its ring and under its watchful eye. We find this theme persisting in the medieval Greek alchemists; this is proved by an eleventh-century Byzantine manuscript which is now at St. Mark’s in Venice, which in the chapter on Cleopatra’s gold work shows an irregular, naively traced, circular ouroboros holding within it the inscription En to pan, “the All in One?
(Fig?
This agrees with what Olympiodorus says of the ancient Egyptian symbologists of the sacred, who, wishing “to represent
the universe on monuments or express it in
sacred characters, inscribed the serpent ouroboros!© (Fig. 4).” Like the amphisbaena, this ouroboros was half black and half white. Laden with other meanings from the distant past as well as

the principal ones mentioned above, the ouroboros was immediately seized upon by the first proponents of ideas arising within the Church that its leaders considered heretical, and received from them still other significations, some of which were clearly contrary to Christian dogma. The Gnostics in particular used this symbol; it is found on a great number of their mystical inscriptions associated with letters or signs that

THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
have been diversely interpreted by numerous scholars, but none of these enigmatic expressions tell us its real meaning in the sense in which the Gnostics so frequently employed it. We know only that they made it the emblem of the annual cycle, of movement, and of the renewal of matter in a pantheistic sense. In the Pistis Sophia, an Alexandrian work generally attributed to the Valentinian Gnostics but which some consider to be the work of the Ophites, the body of the mysterious serpent is divided into twelve parts, twelve “eons” which correspond to the twelve months of the annual cycle. It seems probable that the Gnostics, like Olympiodorus!! and the Ancients, saw in it the image of the “Agathodaimon,” the good spirit which helps and saves; and perhaps it is through this avenue that it approaches a relation with Christ, the Savior. The wide usage given it by the Gnostics hindered its representation in the decorative art of the catacombs by orthodox symbolists of the early Christian epoch, and although it appeared in later Christian iconography, its depiction never became common practice. In the times of the first Roman emperors, the state on one hand and the new-born Church on the other both disapproved the practices of those who dedicated themselves to the occult sciences. Tiberius banished from Italy “magicians and mathematicians”; Claudius and Vitellius reaffirmed the edicts that proscribed astrologists and sorcerers. Tertullian for his part protested against those who sought to understand and explain the enigmas of an old apocalyptic Hebrew work, and accused them in particular of betraying the secrets of gold, silver, and other natural phenomena!?. Threatened thus on all sides, the adepts of these investigative disciplines hid their work in mysterious formulas and under ancient symbols to which they gave special meanings whose key they guarded jealously. Chief among these symbols was the tail-biting snake. The origins of alchemy, which was connected especially closely with the mysterious properties of metals and stones, have been admirably studied by Marcellin Berthelot!?. He 432



THE OUROBOROS
tells us that in its general sense as well as in alchemy “the circular serpent was the guardian of the temple of Knowledge, and only the one who has conquered it can cross the threshold of the holy place!*.” In making the ouroboros the guardian of their secret knowledge, the alchemists again established the connection mentioned before between the name of the symbol and the Greek word ouros taken in the sense of “guardian.” This is very probably the origin of using the shape of the ouroboros for numerous door knockers in France in the eleventh and especially the nineteenth centuries
(Fig. 7). Practically speaking, in alchemical theory the ouroboros was the hieroglyph for “the dissolution of the body by fermentation.” Alchemy also made it the emblem of the active and of the passive elements, the former represented by the tail and the latter by the mouth of the snake—as in the ancient idea, the first giving to the second the substance for a new growth. Perhaps it is in this hermetic context that a symbolic connection was first made between the ouroboros and the “elixir of long life.” On another plane, the circular serpent was the image of eternal wisdom and of its perpetual action in the world. The Kabbalah considers the serpent Nahash, the tempter of Eden, as “the symbol of primordial egoism”; but the ouroboros represents even better the mysterious attraction of the self for itself!®, since the body’s end moves in a circular trajectory away from its beginning only to return and fasten itself there; it does not depart from itself. Modern occultists also look upon it as the symbol of the “full” and the “empty!””; and it is moreover from this aspect that it has always been connected with the hermetic symbolism of the generative organs of man and woman. The medieval authors have scarcely mentioned the symbol of the ouroboros except in a completely exoteric way; those of them who like Albertus Magnus were involved in the study of
alchemy certainly knew of other meanings, but kept this knowledge to themselves. In the thirteenth century, the bishop 443383



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
of Mende, Guillaume Durand, says simply that “before the invention of letters, among the Egyptians, the year was designated in the following way: They drew a dragon that bit its tail, because the year curves back upon itself. And it is thus that it is still marked by some!®.” In the case of a number of these more or less hermetic groups which formed everywhere during the Middle Ages, their traces and testimony about their kind of spirituality and asceticism, methods and rituals, have become very rare. Nevertheless testimony like that found in the Carmelite monastery of Loudun and the notebooks of the Estoile Internelle, both of the fifteenth century, prove that there was quite a profound knowledge, which has now almost disappeared, of the old traditional symbols that were full of rich spiritual nourishment, and that they were interpreted in a perfectly orthodox way, although most often in closed groups. In the above-mentioned notebooks of the Estoile Internelle, the ouroboros encloses the gothic monogram of the name IHsuS, reduced to the consonants IHS, and above the sacred name stand the three crosses of Golgotha (Fig. 5). The snake’s closed ring shows the old symbol of the perpetuity of the sacrifice and the redemption. The drawing of the monogram of Christ placed inside the serpentine ring has been presented as “the symbol of his eternal dominion.” In fact, in this composition the sacred monogram plays the role of the hub and spokes of a wheel whose rim is replaced by the snake—the rim beneath which the wheel’s course takes place. The symbol of the perpetual renewal of Christ’s action is more exactly expressed in this way by the two ideas that the ouroboros and the wheel both suggest: perpetuity and movement—the latter equivalent here to action. In the sixteenth century the ouroborus sometimes represented the everlastingness of the future life. In this same century Jehan Frellon, taking the snake as a symbol of the earth, curved it into an oval shape in which he placed the hornet
(French frelon) and the crab as images of air and water, 434

thus joining images of the three domains of living beings in the world!? (Fig. 6). On a Hermetic—not Masonic—seventeenth-century bookplate, on the trunk of the Tree of Life the ouroboros frames an image of the pelican, seemingly as an emblem of Christ, reviving its young by the ablution of its blood; and the circular serpent testifies to the everlasting continuation of this merciful compassion (Fig. 7). On a panel of painted wood of the eighteenth century, it haloes the head of the phoenix which encloses the alchemical sign for sulphur. It is shown here that the two symbols, the reptile and the fabulous bird, have been endowed from the distant past with two privileges very close to one another: one renews its life with its own substance, the other is reborn from its own ashes; both live forever. The jewelers art sometimes made use of the circular snake. A child’s bracelet on this model, made of yellow and brown twisted
wires, was discovered some time

ago in a Frankish burying ground in Vailly (Aisne). I remember too an eighteenth-century silver bodice-clasp, and also a beautiful gold ring. The clasp and the ring perhaps symbolized the constancy due to conjugal fidelity. In armorial bearings of the church or the nobility, again it is the idea of the everlasting that the ouroboros almost always represents. It is certainly a symbol of the Trinity, it seems to me, that must be seen in the three images of the ouroboros which are sometimes found interlocked, with their circles penetrating each other as in the pattern called in symbolism the Scutum fidei, the shield of faith. The ancient image of perpetual duration, thus tripled in a single whole, accords with the idea of three eternal beings which together make One (Fig. 8).
Fig. 8 The triple ouroboros; from a 16th-century Italian painting.
During the Middle Ages, the whole structure of social life was based on ascending scales whose degrees were sometimes discreetly veiled; chivalry, the monastic order, the corporations and guilds of artisans, the universities, brotherhoods of all kinds, even the brotherhood of vagrant beggars, were founded on this pattern which came to them from the most ancient times. The priesthood itself from the Church’s infancy had its minor and major orders leading to the episcopate, its culmina
tion. Before the thirteenth century, hermetism made of the 436



THE OUROBOROS
ouroboros the symbol of the successive stages which rise to the dignity of the episcopate, that is, the full development of the priesthood. We find in an alchemical document what the ecclesiastical writers of the time failed to say on this subject: “The priest, at first a man of copper, has changed color and nature and has become a man of silver; a few days later, if thou wishest, thou wilt find him changed to a man of gold?!.” In the same sphere, from another angle, the ouroboros symbolized the successive revelations of science, of the knowledge reserved for the chosen few, and of the silence that is imposed on the initiate; for coiling itself mysteriously into a closed circle, of its own accord it closes its mouth. Perhaps it was in this sense that the famous printer and editor of the seventeenth century, Sebastian Mable-Cramoisy, who may have been the heir of the great brotherhoods of Agle?*, magnificently encircled his trademark with its image. De Gassicourt and du Roure de Paulin say that in Freemasonry the ouroboros is frequently shown head downward?3. I do not know what that was intended to express, but usually the reversal is unfavorable to the subject the symbol represents. Another singular symbol in the serpent form is the amphisbaena. This fabulous reptile, whose Greek name means “one who walks on both sides,” was taken for granted as really existing by the classical naturalists, which means that the idea was already old and familiar when their lives began. Pliny describes it thus: “the amphisbaena has a double head; that is, a head at
its tail, as if one mouth were not enough to spew its poi
son24.” Medieval writers simply repeated what Pliny had

two bodies joined together and condemned to pull forever against each other, or else to coil one against the other in an inevitable duel, represented among the Alexandrian Neoplatonists the two principles of good and evil which struggle for mastery in the world, the mastery of human souls. With its two parts, it was both the “agathodaimon,” the spirit of good, and the “cacodaimon,” the spirit of evil. This is the meaning the amphisbaena has retained during the course of the following centuries (Fig. 9). Several of its medieval, and more recent, representations show the amphisbaena as composed of a black serpent and of one of silver, or of gold. In medieval heraldry, the superior of the two serpents was often endowed with an elegant pair of wings?®, and the inferior one sometimes had paws. It was during the decline of Rome that the symbol of the amphisbaena spread from east to west across the countries of
Europe, where it was already known but now came into general use and was Christianized; the old emblem of good and evil became “the double-headed serpent, one of whose heads
represents Christ and the other

PEstoile Internelle.
The notebook of symbols of the fifteenth-century Estoile Internelle shows us a marvelous black and white amphisbaena (Fig. 10). The upper serpent has wings and wears a crown decorated with the royal fleurde-lis; the lower one, entirely black, has saurian feet and crouches on the ground to resist the upward flight of its divine part. Let us say in conclusion that in the world of real snakes, there exist two varieties which move equally frontwards and 438

Modern naturalists have given them the names of Amphisbaena alba and of Amphisbaena fuliginosa; they even possess the characteristic that their very small heads and very thick tails resemble each other. However, they could not have served as prototype for the mythical two-headed amphisbaena of the ancient world, since their habitat is strictly confined to the southern part of America?’.

THE PHOENIX
OR THE EXPLANATION of the phoenix’s presence among F the personal signs for Jesus Christ, once again we must turn to mysterious and prophetic Egypt, for though it cannot be thought that this symbol itself originated in the Nile Basin, its myth was born there—the singular myth that still clothes it and makes it the most marvelous bird ever created by the human imagination. It would seem that the phoenix was known in ancient Asia much earlier than in Egypt: the oldest known Chinese art shows a phoenix often in conjunction with the Nile lily or the lotus, and sharing their symbolic meanings. Surrounded by its long tail feathers like the heart of a rose by its petals (Fig. 1), its image has been revered since time immemorial!. In Assyrian art contemporaneous with the highest period of Egyptian culture, a sacred bird follows or precedes the galloping horses of the king’s chariot, just as the falcon accompanies that of the pharaoh in Egyptian art; and this tutelary bird of the Assyrians resembles a phoenix much more closely than a falcon. The sparrow hawk, falcon, vulture, ibis, and swallow which we find in the religious art of Egypt are birds which are born
and dwell in that country; the Fig.1 The “lucky” phoenix of China. 444411



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
phoenix does not accord with any real species of Egyptian bird, which accounts for the hesitation in identifying it shown by many nineteenth-century scholars. De Rouge sees it as “a kind of heron,” and Champollion-Figeac calls it “a lapwing with plumes.” Its Egyptian name of bennu (a name which reflects an idea of splendor, and which seems, Lefébure suggets, to be related to the Assyrian word banu, meaning brilliant) hints at the vivid color which the Greeks translated as foinix, “crimsoned,” from foinikes, “the color crimson”; foinix, which the Hellenist scholar Planche translates as “fire bird*.” There is no wading bird which corresponds to this color description, not even the flamingo as some have proposed. This is why, after having considered a number of depictions of the phoenix which coincide with the one on an obelisk at Cairo (Fig. 2), most Egyptologists have supported Cuvier’s theory which sees Fig. 2 The phoenix on the phoenix’s natural prototype in the golden 4 basalt obelisk in Cairo. Sh easant of Asia. This opinion is supported by the important role played by this bird in the symbolic art of Asia and especially that of China. In China, the jinji (the golden game-hen) and the pheasant fu-wu are sculpted, embroidered, engraved, painted, or drawn everywhere, with vari
ous but always positive meanings?.
Canon Davin has written many learned pages which are in agreement with what I have just said, and which come to the same conclusion about the close kinship between the fabled Egyptian phoenix and the real golden pheasant. The latter was not known in Rome until the time of the first emperors, and was very rarely shown in Christian art; however, Dom Leclercq, who should always be consulted in connection with the art of early Christianity, shows a mosaic of Furni in which the cock pheasant appears beside his hen®. Tt seems clear that in the “Celestial Empire” of China the phoenix of fable was also no other than a poeticized version of the pheasant. Among the three hundred and sixty species 442



THE PHOENIX
of birds known in ancient China, it was the phoenix, feng huang, that wore the crown. Feng means male and huang female; the phoenix, it was said, is born in the Kingdom of the Wise, to the east of China, probably on some imaginary island. It eats nothing but the fruit of one sort of bamboo and drinks only the purest water. All the birds of heaven pay homage to it when it appears, and if it sings, all the cocks in the world echo it. Its song is a melody of five notes. It is six feet tall and its plumage is of five glowing colors’. This divine bird is born, it was said, from the sun or from fire. Son of the flame, and issuing thus from the great active principle yang, the phoenix exerts a decisive influence on the conception and birth of children, and in company with the unicorn it brings their souls to their mothers from above’. It is also an active factor of
life in springtime germination and growth, and its image, like that of the dragon, takes part in the solemn rites of the “Growth Ceremony?.”” The phoenix, protector of emperors, was

thought to appear to some holy man or great one of the empire in times of prosperity, when heaven bestowed special blessings on its children; in bad times, it withdrew to blessed solitudes far from the Chinese ocean and the Blue Sea. It was also said that the holy souls in heaven are fed divine dishes, among them the livers of dragons and the marrow of the phoenix, which keep their immortal state in a condition of unequalled bliss. In the Egyptian religion, the bennu, shown in the hieroglyphs in the conventional aspect of a wading bird crowned with a plume (Fig. 3), was connected with the interwoven cults of Osiris and Ra. Virey tells us that it was “the symbol of periodic appearances, and so of sunrises; that is to say—let us take this into account at once—it was a symbol of the res- 444433



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
urrections of Osiris!” All the images of the bennu are in general connected with the sun, whether at the tomb of Osiris in Abydos, at Anteopolis or Koptos or Edfu. At Koptos as at Anteopolis, the bennu, its breast provided with two human arms, stretches them out toward the star Sothis (our Sirius), which appears in the sky before the sun rises!!. In a text found in the funerary coffer of an Egyptian queen of the eleventh dynasty, Osiris entrusts to the bennu the secrets of eternity. In the Ritual of the Dead, which is so interesting with its ideas of Purgatory and of Hell, Osiris says: “I am the bennu, the great one who is in Annu (Heliopolis); I am the law of existence and of beings” (birth, death, and resurrection!?), This identification of Osiris and the bird sacred to him is found from very early times, but it seems that it was only rather late, in the last millenary before our era, that in the temple of Heliopolis the bennu was honored with its own legend. (This was doubtless due to the Heliopolitan priest’s anxiety to hide, under indecipherable enigmas, from the priests of Memphis and Thebes the astronomical discovery that he had made of the “Sothic period!3” and the “circular cycle!4.”) This legend said that there never existed more than one bennu on earth. When it felt its five hundredth year approaching, it took flight, passing first by Arabia, to Heliopolis, where the priests were divinely forewarned of its coming. There on the altar of the Sun temple it built a funeral pyre of precious Arabian spices, upon which, when the sun’s rays set it on fire, the phoenix itself was consumed. But from its ashes was immediately born a little worm that before the end of the day was transformed into a new and fully vigorous bennu. According to Herodotus, Hesiod lived in the time of Homer, and others make him the contemporary of Solomon; in any case, Pliny, Plutarch, and Ausonius!° claim that he was the first to speak of the legend of the bennu in the classical countries, where it was called by the Greek name of foenix, phoenix.

THE PHOENIX
“If this bird,” says Herodotus, “is like the portrait that has been drawn of it, its wings are part golden and part red, and
the shape of its body is like the eagle’s.”
It was in 480 B.c., the same year in which the famous battle was fought at Thermopylae, that Herodotus visited Egypr;
his travel accounts are quite confused!®. Pliny, in his Natural History, and Ovid who wrote his Metamorphoses at the time of Christ’s birth, were more exact. Pliny, attributing his information to Manilius, says of the phoenix: “No one has ever seen it eat. In Arabia it is dedicated to the sun, and it lives five hundred years; when it comes to the end of its life, it makes a nest of bits of cinnamon bark and of rosemary, fills it with perfumes, and dies upon it. From its bones and their marrow comes a worm which becomes a new phoenix, whose first act is to arrange a worthy funeral; it carries the whole nest to the City of the Sun {Heliopolis}, and places it on the altar there. This same Manilius says the turning cycle of the Great Year is accomplished with the Phoenix, and that then the same signs reappear of the seasons and the planets. This renewal takes place at noon on the day when the sun enters the sign of the Ram.” A little later Tacitus also, in speaking of the phoenix, brought proof that in his time the secret of the “Sothic petiod,” whose discovery the priests of Heliopolis had cloaked in mystery, had been unveiled. Pomponius Mela on his side expresses himself thus: “The phoenix is always alone, for it has neither father nor mother. After having lived five hundred years, it lies down on a pyre which it has built of heaped up spices and lets itself be consumed. Then when the liquid element of its parts solidifies, it engenders itself from itself and is reborn. When it has gath
ered enough strength, it carries the bones of its former body wrapped in myrrh to a town in Egypt called the City of the Sun, places them in a sanctuary and consecrates them with special funerary rites!’.” And the Greek poet of Egypt,
Nonnus, in the fourth century, in his Hymn to the Sun}, 444455



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
spoke in much the same way. Nonnus wrote these lines before his conversion to Christianity, but nevertheless expresses in them the same thought as Pomponius Mela’s in the passage quoted above: that the phoenix brings about its rebirth from itself, and not from any other source; and this above all is the reason why Christian symbolism chose the fabulous bird as one of the most perfect symbols of the risen Christ. The legend of the phoenix, set forth more or less clearly by the authors I have mentioned, as well as others, was soon known in all parts of the vast Empire. Christian symbolism, finding it everywhere, made it into one of the principal symbols of the Resurrection. Human life is short, and often exposed to undeservedly harsh circumstances, as well as to the evildoing of other people. The thinkers and theologians of ancient Egypt believed that the divine powers, in the name of justice to mankind, must resurrect the human being after death so that he might at last be dealt with, in body and soul, according to the inviolable laws of an all-encompassing justice, in a life untouched by accidents. They proclaimed this real faith in the restoration of the human being after death by the symbols of the phoenix, the frog, deciduous trees and others, all symbols that the Christian religion accepted as appropriate for the person of the resurrected Christ. The early monuments of Christian art are characterized by the common root-idea of hope, liberation, and immortality. “But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive!?.” This dogma, so clearly affirmed by the new faith, needed symbols to manifest itself to the eyes of the world. For this glorious role, the priests and teachers of the newborn symbology chose first of all the Egyptian phoenix; all the other symbols of resurrection were adopted after it. The phoenix, always the only one of its kind on earth, reborn from its own ashes under the
burning rays of the sun and in the sweet-smelling fire of 446

THE PHOENIX
spices, is one of the most beautiful symbols of Christ. The
Church Fathers of the early centuries celebrated it, some na
ively believing the naturalists of their time, others, the majority perhaps, accepting the legend with wise reservations; all, however, drawing from the miraculous bird the same conclusion of the certainty of the resurrection of the body, and making it the image of the resurrected Christ. St. Clement, one of
the first of St. Peter’s successors as Bishop of Rome, about
the year 79 wrote to the Church at Corinth: “Behold this paradoxical prodigy which takes place in the East, in Arabia: there is a bird called the phoenix, the only one of its kind, and it lives five hundred years...” and the pope told the legend as Pliny, Ovid, and other classical writers had done. He concludes: “Shall we judge it a great and astonishing matter that the Artisan of the Universe should bring about the resurrection of all those who have served him in a holy manner, with the confidence of a valiant faith, when he shows us with so small a thing as a bird the magnificence of his promise??°’ Many others

Christian art, as a symbol of this teaching or as an image of Christ. In either role, it remained in accordance with the spirit of the ancient Egyptian bennu who represented the reappearance of the dead, the resurrections of Ositis, and finally the idea of the reanimation of the human body after death. When it reflected the image of Christ, it was often shown perched on the palm tree (Fig. 4). Martigny remarked that “When St. Paul is shown on any ancient monument, the phoenix on the palm tree is always behind this apostle” who was the principal herald of the doctrine of Christ’s Resurrection. Bosio applied to the phoenix perched on A44T

the palm the words of the Song of Songs: Ascendam in palmam et apprehendam fructus ejus: “I will go up into the palm tree, and will take hold of the fruit thereof??.”’ Often the phoenix bears the palm of the conquerors because of its conquest of death, or like the dove it holds the branch of peace. “It is Christ saying to Christians: Peace be unto you??.”” Like the eagle and the falcon, the phoenix is closely connected with the idea of the sun and of light, and it is frequently seen on Christian lamps of Roman times** (Fig. 5). Because it was supposed to be reborn from its own destruction, and thus to prolong its existence indefinitely, it was looked upon as one of the emblems of cyclic eternity by Christians just as it had been in the times preceding them. This is its significance on the coins and medals of the non-Christian Roman emperors, such as a coin of Augustus inscribed AETERNITAS. AVGFEL. TEMP. REPARATIO: “The eternity of Augustus—Happy renewal of Fig. 5 The phoenix on the time,” and the phoenix dominates the in

to the present day sometimes have placed
the phoenix on the alchemical sign for sulphur, which is a tri
angle carrying an inverted cross at its base. I reproduce here one of these representations of the phoenix on the sign for sulphur (Fig. 6). This eighteenth-century work is painted on a wooden panel and rather faded, but the design is still quite clear: on a brown background, the golden triangle of sulphur is outlined by a red band, and the scarlet image of the phoenix fills it completely; the bird’s head stands out against a skyblue aureole framed by an ouroboros, the serpent curled in a circle and biting its tail, which clearly defines the character of the phoenix as an image of perpetuity through the continual
renewal of cycles. 444488



THE PHOENIX
Above the point of the alchemical triangle are the four Hebrew letters of the holy tetragrammaton:
YOD-HE-VAV-HE The Most High
Medieval writers explained as best they could the myth of the burning up and the rebirth of the phoenix. The bestiaries of the Romanesque period, including that of William of Normandy, sang its praises. Mystics of the Middle Ages also made a connection between the phoenix and Christ, because the former is born without obeying the ordinary laws of reproduction, and because only one ever exists on earth; thus, said the symbolists, Jesus came into the world without a terrestrial father, and never has the world known another man like him. The Armenian Bestiary published by Father Cahier??, and others, tell the legend of the phoenix in much the same way as William of Normandy. They all emphasize that the symbolic bird, like Christ, comes back to life exactly three days after its death. In French heraldry, the phoenix was and is one of the emblems of hope, as a human feeling as well as one of the theological virtues. It is also a symbol of purity of conscience, and sometimes, in the Middle Ages and by extension, of chastity. An Egyptian hieroglyphic text of the funeral liturgy has the dead person say in the presence of Osiris, the judge of the
dead: “I am pure, I am pure, I

Fig. 7 The phoenix symbolizing fortitude and chastity; a 15th-century medal.
This ancient Egyptian concept passed through time and is found again in the Middle Ages; according to Huysman, the image of the phoenix we see in the sculptures of Chartres Cathedral is the attribute of chastity and more especially feminine chastity?”. A medal struck at the end of the fifteenth century, in honor of Julia Astalia, has on its reverse side a phoenix surrounded by flames, and by the inscribed words: Exemplum unicum for.(titudinis) et pud.(icitiae): “Unique example of fortitude and chastity (Fig. 7).” The same meaning of chastity is to be noted in the phoenix of the rose window of the Cathedral of Paris and the sculptures at Amiens®. In the same way that the Far East associated the phoenix as the protector of human births with the lotus which is the flower of life, Western art sometimes related it to the nenuphar or water lily, especially the white nymphea which is an emblem of chastity and of virginity, because in former times (and still today) the nymphea plants were used to make 45a0

THE SPHINX
HE SPHINX IS the best known of all the hybrid creatures, Tirade up of two bodies of natural animals. In Egyptwhere the magnificent Great Sphinx is far older than the pyramids, which were constructed in the third millenary before Christ! —it is formed of a human head and breast, almost always masculine, and the body of a lion. In Greece it is more often shown with the head and breast of a woman. In Mycenaean and Etruscan art? (Fig. 1), the animal-body is often so slender that it suggests some swifter and less sturdy species than the lion, and sometimes even seems to have the feet and tail of the greyhound, while in some other representations, the hind legs are those of a bull. Following the example of Pliny, Pomponius Mela speaks of the sphinx as a strange animal that actually lives in the mountains of Ethiopia, the country that the Ancients made the home of such a horrific fauna. Both writers describe them as dark-skinned animals with female teats on the belly?. The sphinx had many meanings in Egypt. In its masculine aspect it represented Harmakhis, “Lord of the Two Horizons,” a concept that linked it with Anubis and perhaps Amon-Ra, symbolic entities that relate to the sun’s daily course, the image of human life.

445533



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
From the religious aspect, the sphinx was the emblem of divine sovereignty, wisdom, and force, expressed in impassive majesty and inviolate repose. It always represented a god or a king—which amounts to the same, as the pharaoh was the emanation or earthly incarnation of the Sun-god Ra‘. The Sphinx was also regarded as a solar divinity and one of the symbols of abundance®. From the philosophical aspect, and in the tradition of the Egyptian hermetic works (said to be inspiced by the god Thoth, the thrice-great Word, “Hermes Trismegistus”), the sphinx was the symbol of unity, of truth, and of the Absolute®. And from still another aspect comes the familiar Greek story of Oedipus and the sphinx. At Thebes, in Boeotia, a huge female sphinx propounded a riddle to the passersby, and tore in pieces those who could not solve it: What animal is it that in the morning goes on four feet, on two at noon, and in the evening on three? Oedipus replied that it was man, who in his childhood crawls on all fours, walks on two feet in the noon of his life, and when he is old needs a staff as well as his two legs. Having thus thwarted the sphinx, Oedipus drew his sword and killed it. This abominable sphinx, which the mythologists say was born of Typhon and Echidne in the wilds
of Ethiopia’, was always and everywhere regarded as an evil
monster: the antithesis of the Egyptian sphinx, which is the symbol of divine light and wisdom. Of all the mysteries which engaged the thought of the An
cients, the most vital was the enigma surrounding the ending, the beginning, and the flowering of life. Every egg, every seed, bears within it a germ which in favorable conditions brings forth a being resembling its producer. The people of the ancient world showed a lively and sincere gratitude to God the Creator, however they conceived of him, for this gift. Among the Egyptians, the sphinx was linked to the symbolism of the concern their wise men felt for life’s mystery. It was one of the symbols of the life-giving sun, and the female sphinx was the image of Isis, mother of Horus; the ram- 454

THE SPHINX
sphinx represented Amon, “considered as the power that begets and maintains the life of creation®.” Sacred sculpture
placed two sphinxes, one on each side of the Tree of Life,
“to symbolize the double idea of fertilization and of conception? (Fig. 2),” and the same is true in Aegean art of the Mycenaean epoch!°, and in many other places. In Greece, certain coins from Chios show the sphinx and the amphora
placed beside each other!!, reminding us that for the ancient world woman was “the vase of life” and the amphora one of the symbols for a pregnant woman. It seems that the Druids, in Gaul, related the many-breasted sphinx with the Egyptian sphinx as a symbol of fertile maternity. For the ancient Egyptians, human life on earth was only a pre-existence. Nut, the mother of Osiris, was said to cause
unceasingly those who died each day to be born to a new life; the death bed “is the cradle of the deceased!?.” A vignette from The Book of the Dead‘? represents the phases of rebirth after the death of the human being. Sphinxes take part in this transformation, and one of them, reclining on a bed, personifles Harmakhis, the rising sun, divine symbol of resurrection. Although the sphinx was a solar divinity among the Egyp

tians!*, it had no wings, at least not before the Hellenistic period; but the region of the northern shores of the Mediterranean and its islands shows us winged sphinxes in flight toward the sun. In his famous excavations at Mycenae, Schliemann found sphinxes in the tombs of princes!> and in the first Christian centuries the old custom was preserved of placing in the shadows of sepulchers those ancient symbols of solar light which later became symbols of Christ. “Tr is the light of the sun,” says Eliphas Lévi, “that is represented by these gigantic sphinxes with the bodies of lions and the heads of magi!®.” For the ancient priests of Egypt, this was the divine light in its most divine conception. If we turn to the other side of the earth, unexpectedly we find the sphinx again in the archeology of the Aymara Indians of Peru, where once more it turned its great stone gaze toward the beneficent course of the sun!” (Fig. 3). In spite of all distortions attendant
on its wanderings, even in Rome the
sphinx preserved its character as a hieroglyph of light. The sphinx that decorates the top of a cornice in the ancient frescoes of Livy’s house on the Palatine carries on its forehead a lamp- u
like flame!8. Fig. 3. Pre-Colombian

isted in Alexandria, from the beginning of Christianity, an important school for the instruction of neophytes and the preparation of the clergy. This institution, called simply the
Didasculum (“the school”), which was at the height of its powers in the third century, succeeded in reconciling earlier religious ideas with the dogma, morality, and spirit of Christianity. These ideas included the old Egyptian theory of the creative Word?°, the more recent thesis of the Logos, the divine Word intermediate between God and humanity, a concept propagated by Philo and the Hellenistic philosophers; the di
vine spirit which breathes life into the soul; the immortality of 4a5]6



THE SPHINX
the soul, etc. Certain ancient Egyptian symbols which could be reconciled with the new religion were applied to Christ, to
the Christian mysteries, or to the faithful soul: the sacred scarab, the ibis, the falcon, the frog, the mongoose, the palm
tree, the lotus, etc. It could indeed be that the sphinx was first used as a sym
bol for Christ by the Alexandrian Gnostics, and accepted as
such by the Didasculum in spite of its usual antagonism to
their viewpoint; the ancient meanings attributed to the sphinx
lent themselves so well to this adaptation: Jesus, like the Egyptian Harmakhis, was “Lord of the Two Horizons” —of the East, which from earliest Christian times represented his birth, and the West, which symbolized his death; he is the God of light, but also of the kingdom of shadows. He is conceived as sovereignty, all-powerful force, and divine wisdom; further, as the divine Sun, the source of abundance, and the repository of eternal secrets. The following centuries preserved this first. reconciliation between Christ and the symbolic meanings of the Egyptian sphinx. In ancient Egyptian, le Cour says, “the word Christ means the pos- Fig. 4: Stone engraving of
sessor of the secret?!” For the only Gecipuszand tie, sein: point in which the Sphinx of Egypt resembles the evil sphinx which Oedipus slew in Boeotia (Fig. 4) is that it also guarded
a secret, as the Theban sphinx guarded its riddle—a secret of supreme wisdom for the direction of human life, summed up in four verbs: To know—to dare—to will—to be silent. These were now applied to Christ, for the Christian
teachers believed that he exemplified to its fullest degree the
sphinx’s precept. When a man governs his life by these four verbs in connection with each other, he receives from them
the maximum force that he is capable of using. They must be
looked at thus: 445577



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
To know—to dare—to will—to be silent. To know how to dare, to know how to will, to know how to be silent; To dare to know, to dare to will, to dare to be silent; To will to know, to will to dare, to will to be silent; To be silent about one’s knowing, to be silent about the goals of one’s daring, to be silent about one’s will.
The characteristic which placed the sphinx in contact with the mystery of life only enhanced its value as a symbol of Jesus Christ; for Christianity, even more than earlier religions, proclaimed in its sacred art as in its liturgy a profound gratitude for the gift of life to the one constantly invoked as “Author of life,’ whom it called “our life”: Jesu, auctor vitae
Jesu, vita nostra??. So it should not be surprising to see the
Tree of Life standing between two sphinxes on a bas-relief in the Catholicon, the cathedral of Athens, just as it was in ancient Egypt and in Crete??. Whether or not this bas-relief was an old work of pagan art, its use in this place is no less significant. Jesus was the “light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world?*”; and the sphinx, solar god of the intense, pure light of the Egyptian desert, was a suitable symbol to represent it. So it is difficult to doubt that the first Christian symbolists of Alexandria, who were so deeply attached to the ancient Egyptian symbols, were the first to reconcile Christ as light of the world, with the sphinx, symbol of the Sun, the god of their country. Like the griffin and the centaur, the sphinx has represented the union of the divine and human natures in the figure of Christ, and his two-fold sovereignty over the spiritual and material worlds. In the sphinx as in the centaur, his divinity is represented by the human head and breast, because this part is animated by the soul, created, according to Genesis, in the image of God?>; and the body of the quadruped represents his 458
458



THE SPHINX
humanity, attached like ours to the earth during his earthly life. All that I have said about the symbolism of the centaur relating to this union of two natures is equally valid for the sphinx. The two-fold nature of the sphinx suggests the presence within it of two different hearts: one belonging to its human breast and the other to its animal body. It is “the animal with two hearts.” The same should apply to the centaur, but I do not believe that the ancient Christian symbolists ever gave this their attention. For them, everything arising from the spiritual element and the higher functions of the human soul was related to the first of the two hearts of the sphinx, to the heart of the human breast. In their eyes, it was from this heart that intelligence, knowledge, will, and all the noble faculties and feelings were derived. In this they agreed with the Ancientsthe Assyrians and especially the Egyptians, who placed the seat of the soul and reason in the heart, and not in the brain. To the second part of the sphinx, they related everything concerned with the physical life of man and his lower appetites—lawful or sinful—his earthly goods, his ordinary
preoccupations.
As a result they compared to the first heart the spiritual man whose thoughts dwell in the more elevated realm of religion, and who gives precedence in his life to the concerns of a higher level over the mundane interests of the material world. The heavy, sensual, and commonplace man was compared with the second heart: the man who carries his life like a leaden weight and never raises his head higher than the
edge of his field, his dining table, or his cash box. But there is something else: certain images of the sphinx have the head and upper body of man, the wings of the eagle, the forepart of the lion, and the hindquarters of the bull; and it was above all this sphinx that engaged the attention of the Christian mystics, because it evoked the four sacred animals in the visions of Ezekiel?© and St. John?”. As we have seen in speaking of the Tetramorph, the combined totality of these 445599



THE BESTIARY OF CHRIST
four animals was, in Christian symbolism, one of the great, mysterious emblems of Christ, which condensed in itself all the individual meanings of each of the separate animals. So the sphinx, which was made up of one part of each of the four, was a true tetramorph. The occultists of today, remote as most of them are from early hermetists, recognize this: “The sphinx displays to the Christian,” says one of them, “the angel?8, the eagle, the lion and the bull?9,” and Schuré *° says that the entire evolution of the animal nature can be seen in the human and bovine parts while the divine nature is visible in the eagle’s wings. The eagle has indeed, in certain themes in Christian iconography and symbolism such as the griffin, represented the divine nature; however it is the human part that represents it in the sphinx.
