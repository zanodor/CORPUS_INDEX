Gallo-Roman examples of the fascinum in bronze. The topmost is an example of the "fist and phallus" amulet with a manus fica.
Phallus inscribed on a paving stone at Pompeii
In ancient Roman religion and magic, the fascinus or fascinum was the embodiment
of the divine phallus. The word can refer to the deity himself (Fascinus), to phallus
effigies and amulets, and to the spells used to invoke his divine protection.[1] Pliny calls
it a medicus invidiae, a "doctor" or remedy for envy (invidia, a "looking upon") or the
evil eye.
Fascinus from Pompeii
Public religion



showing a phallus
The Vestal Virgins tended the cult of the fascinus populi Romani, the sacred image of
the phallus that was one of the tokens of the safety of the state (sacra Romana). It was
thus associated with the Palladium.[2] Roman myths, such as the begetting of Servius
Tullius, suggest that this phallus was an embodiment of a masculine generative power
located within the hearth, regarded as sacred.[3] When a general celebrated a triumph,
the Vestals hung an effigy of the fascinus on the underside of his chariot to protect him
from invidia.[4]
Augustine, whose primary source on Roman religion was the lost theological works of
Marcus Terentius Varro, notes that a phallic image was carried in procession annually
at the festival of Father Liber, the Roman god identified with Dionysus or Bacchus, for
the purpose of protecting the fields from fascinatio, magic compulsion:[5]
As a divinized phallus, Fascinus shared attributes with Mutunus Tutunus, whose shrine
was supposed to date from the founding of the city, and the imported Greek god
Priapus.[7]
A graphic representation of the power of the fascinus to ward off the evil eye is found
on a Roman mosaic that depicts a phallus ejaculating into a disembodied eye.[8] The
Varro says that certain rites of Liber were celebrated in Italy which
were of such unrestrained wickedness that the shameful parts of the
male were worshipped at crossroads in his honour. ... For, during the
days of the festival of Liber, this obscene member, placed on a little
trolley, was first exhibited with great honour at the crossroads in the
countryside, and then conveyed into the city itself. ... In this way, it
seems, the god Liber was to be propitiated, in order to secure the
growth of seeds and to repel enchantment (fascinatio) from the
fields.[6]
Magic symbols



motif is also known from multiple relief sculptures from Leptis Magna in present-day
Libya.[9] A 1st-century BC terracotta figurine shows "two little phallus-men sawing an
eyeball in half."[10]
Phallic charms, often winged, were ubiquitous in Roman culture, from jewelry to bells
and wind chimes to lamps.[11] The fascinus was thought particularly to ward off evil
from children, mainly boys, and from conquering generals. Pliny notes the custom of
hanging a phallic charm on a baby's neck, and examples have been found of phallus
bearing rings too small to be worn except by children.[12]
The "fist and phallus" amulet was prevalent amongst soldiers. These are phallic
pendants with a representation of a (usually) clenched fist at the bottom of the shaft,
facing away from the glans. Several examples show the fist making the manus fica or
"fig sign", a symbol of good luck.[13] The largest known collection comes from
Camulodunum.[14]

The English word "fascinate" ultimately derives from Latin fascinum and the related
verb fascinare, "to use the power of the fascinus," that is, "to practice magic" and
hence "to enchant, bewitch." Catullus uses the verb at the end of Carmen 7, a
Etymology



hendecasyllabic poem addressing his lover Lesbia; he expresses his infinite desire for
kisses that cannot be counted by voyeurs nor "fascinated" (put under a spell) by a
malicious tongue; such bliss, as also in Carmen 5, potentially attracts invidia.[15]
Fescennine Verses, the satiric and often lewd songs or chants performed on various
social occasions, may have been so-named from the fascinum; ancient sources
propose this etymology along with an alternative origin from Fescennia, a small town in
Etruria.[16]
