PREFACE
The favourable reception accorded to the first series
of Records of the Past, and the hope more than once
expressed since its discontinuance that a similar
series would be again started, have led to this second
attempt to lay before the public some of the most
important documents left us by the civilised nations
of the ancient Oriental world. During the ten years
that have elapsed since the first series was concluded,
Assyrian research may be said to have entered upon
a new phase. Expeditions have returned from
Babylonia, bringing with them the spoils of ancient
libraries, the clay tablets preserved in the British
Museum and elsewhere have been copied and
examined with increased industry and exactness,
and students have been flocking to the new study in
Germany and America. The decipherment of the
cuneiform inscriptions of Van has opened up a fresh
world of language and history, and the geography of
Western Asia in the Assyrian epoch has been
mapped out in almost all its essential details.
The increase of materials, and more especially of



VI PREFACE
labourers in the field of research, has made our know
ledge of the Assyrian lexicon at once wider and
more accurate. Inscriptions which were still obscure
ten years ago can now be read with a fair approach
to exactness, while many of the translations proposed
in the former series of the Records can be amended
in many respects. Indeed there are certain cases in
which the progress of knowledge has shown the
tentative renderings of a few years ago to be so
faulty, if not misleading, that it has been determined
to replace them by revised translations in the series
which is now being issued.
The new series will, it is hoped, be found to be
an improvement upon its predecessor in certain
points. The translations will be provided with fuller
introductions and notes, bearing more particularly
upon the history, geography, and theology of the
texts, and drawing attention to the illustrations they
afford of the Scriptures of the Old Testament. The
historical inscriptions, moreover, will be published, so
far as is possible, in chronological order.
In one point, however, a difference will be noticed
between the plan of this second series of Records and
that of the first. The value of a translation from a
language known only to a few scholars depends in
large measure upon the confidence with which its
precise wording can be accepted. The writer who
wishes to make use of a translation from an Egyp
tian or Assyrian text for historical or controversial
purposes ought to know where it is certain, and



PREFACE
where it is only possible, or at most probable. He
ought to receive warning of passages or words or
readings of doubtful character, and the translator
ought to provide proofs of any new renderings he
may give. In the present series of volumes, accord
ingly, doubtful words and expressions will be
followed by a note of interrogation, the preceding
word being put into italics where necessary : other
wise italics will be used only for the transliteration
of proper names or words which cannot at present
be translated. The notes will contain a justification
of new translations, whether of words hitherto unde
ciphered or of words to which a different signification
has hitherto been attached. The names of indi
viduals will be distinguished from those of deities or
localities by being printed in Roman type, whereas
the names of deities and localities will be in capitals.
Though exploration and discovery have been
carried on actively in Egypt during the last decade,
thanks mainly to the Egypt Exploration Fund and
the enterprise of Professor Maspero, the results have
not been so startling or numerous as those which
have attended the progress of the younger study of
Assyriology. There is not the same reason for
amending the translations, previously published, of
Egyptian documents, nor has any large number of
historical texts been brought to light. Instead, there
fore, of publishing alternately translations from the
Assyrian and Egyptian monuments, Assyrian and
Egyptian texts will appear in the same volume,



PREFACE
though it will doubtless happen that the Assyrian
element will preponderate in some volumes, the
Egyptian element in others. Egyptian and Assyrian,
of course, will not be exclusively represented ; Phoe
nicians and Proto-Armenians have left us written monuments, comparatively few though they may be,
and the Records of the Past would be incomplete
without such important inscriptions as that of the
Moabite king Mesha or of the Hebrew Pool of
Siloam.
In commending the first volume of this new series
of Records to the approval of the public, the Editor
must not forget to say that the enterprise is inter
national, eminent scholars belonging to all national
ities having consented to take part in it, and that if
his name appears somewhat too frequently in the
present volume, it is a fault which shall not occur
again.

The Assyrian Calendar



THE DYNASTIC TABLETS AND CHRONICLES OF THE BABYLONIANS
By the Editor
Chronology is the skeleton of history, and until
we can find the correct chronological place for a his
torical monument it loses a large part of its value.
Thanks to the lists of the so-called eponyms, by
means of whom the Assyrians dated their years, the
chronology of the Assyrian kings has long since been
placed upon a satisfactory footing as far back as the
tenth century before our era. The dates, moreover,
assigned by Sennacherib to Tiglath-Pileser I. (B.C.
1 1 06), and Tukulti-Uras, the son of Shalmaneser I.
(B.C. 1290), as well as the lengthy genealogies with
which these kings are connected, enable us to extend
Assyrian chronology back for another five hundred
years, though, of course, with only approximate
accuracy. While our knowledge of Assyrian chronology,
however, has thus been tolerably fixed for a long
time past, we have had to depend upon the vague
and contradictory statements of Greek writers for
VOL. I . B



RECORDS OF THE PAST
our knowledge of the chronology of the older kingdom of Babylonia. Apart from the invaluable table of kings known as Ptolemy's Canon, which belongs
to the later period of Babylonian history, and the
unsatisfactory list of dynasties excerpted from an
epitomist of Berossos, our only monumental authori
ties for Babylonian chronology were the Assyrian
inscriptions themselves, together with a few fragments
of a dynastic tablet brought to light by Mr.
George Smith and the so-called Synchronous History
of Assyria and Babylonia, of which I published a
translation in the former series of Records of the
Past (vol. iii.) This " Synchronous History " was
composed by an Assyrian scribe, and consists of
brief notices of the occasions on which the kings of
the two countries had entered into relation, hostile or
otherwise, with one another. Since my translation
was published in 1874, another large fragment of
the tablet has been discovered, and accordingly I
purpose giving a new translation of the whole docu
^ ment in a future volume of the present series. The
" Synchronous History " gives no dates, and conse
quently its chronological value depends upon our
knowledge of the respective dates to which the
Assyrian monarchs mentioned in it belong.
Within the last few years a number of discoveries
due to Mr. Pinches has entirely changed our position
in regard to the chronology of the Babylonian kings.
As I have already stated, Mr. Smith found among
the tablets brought from the royal library of Nineveh



DYNASTIC TABLETS OF THE BABYLONIANS 3
a small fragment which, as he perceived, contained
the names and regnal years of the kings of Baby
lonia, arranged in dynasties. The work to which it
belonged must accordingly have been similar to that
from which Berossos derived his dynastic list of
Chaldean monarchs. Mr. Smith published the frag
ment, with a translation and commentary, in the
Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archceology,
iii. 2 (1874). It is written on both sides, and the
tablet once consisted of six columns, each containing
about seventy lines. I will call it the " Third
Dynastic Tablet."
The next discovery was made by Mr. Pinches six
years later among the inscriptions brought from the
site of Babylon by the overseer of Mr. Hormuzd
Rassam. He found among them a small tablet of
unbaked clay, quite complete and inscribed on both
sides. It contains the names of the kings belonging
to two early dynasties, the number of years reigned
by each king being added to the names in the case
of the first dynasty. The tablet seems to be a sort
of schoolboy's exercise, having been copied from
some larger work in order to be committed to
memory. The Reverse has been published by Mr.
Pinches in the Proceedings of the Society of Biblical
Archceology, 7th December 1880, and I will call it
the " First Dynastic Tablet."
Another and more important document — the
" Second Dynastic Tablet "—was published by Mr.
Pinches, with a translation and explanation, in the



RECORDS OF THE PAST
Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archczology, 6th
May 1884. This is also a tablet of unbaked clay
from Babylonia, and it contains a list of the Baby
lonian sovereigns, arranged in dynasties, from the first
dynasty which made the city of Babylon the capital
down to the period of the Persian conquest. The
number of regnal years is added to the name of
each king and the length of time each dynasty lasted
is duly recorded. The names of some of the kings
are written in an abbreviated form : this is especially
the case with those belonging to the second dynasty.
The list, it will be observed, is confined to the
dynasties which reigned in Babylon itself. No
notice is taken of the kings and dynasties who ruled
in " Accad and Sumer " before Babylon became the
capital of the empire. The lost columns of the
" Third Dynastic Tablet " show how numerous they
were, and the fact is borne out by the bricks and other monuments of early Chaldean monarchs
whose names do not occur among the successors of
'Sumu-abi. Most of the kings, indeed, whose names
are known to us in connection with the temples they
built or restored belonged to older dynasties than
those which had their seat in the city of Babylon.
A considerable number of their names is to be
found in another tablet brought by Mr. Rassam from
Assyria, and published by Mr. Pinches in the Pro
ceedings of the Society of Biblical Archceology, iith
January 1881. A small portion of it had already
been published in W. A. I., ii. 65, and had given rise



DYNASTIC TABLETS OF THE BABYLONIANS S
to a good many false conclusions. The object of
this tablet was philological and not chronological ; in
fact the writer expressly states that the names of the
kings were " not written according to their chrono
logical order." He merely wished to furnish the
Semitic or Assyro-Babylonian translations of the Accado-Sumerian and Kassite names borne by so
many of the early princes, and in some cases of the
mode in which the names of Semitic kings were pro
nounced or written by their Accadian subjects.
Among the latter is the name of Sargon of Accad,
the ancient hero of the Semitic population of Chaldaea,
who founded the first Semitic empire in the country
and established a great library in his capital city of
Agade or Accad near Sippara. The seal of his
librarian, Ibni-sarru, of very beautiful workmanship,
is now in Paris, and has been published by M. de
Clercq [Collection de Clercq, pi. 5, No. 46), while a
copy of his annals, together with those of his son
Naram-Sin, is to be found in W. A. I., iv. 34. His
date has been fixed by a passage in a cylinder of
Nabonidos discovered in the ruins of the temple of
the Sun-god at Sippara, and published in W. A. I.,
V. 64. The antiquarian zeal of Nabonidos led him to
excavate among the foundations of the temple in the
hope of finding the cylinder of Naram-Sin, who was
known to have been the founder of it, and he tells
us (col. ii. 5 6 seq^ :
" I sought for its old foundation-stone, and eighteen cubits deep



RECORDS OF THE PAST
1 dug into the ground, and the foundation-stone of Naram-Sin, the son of Sargon, which for 3200 years no king who had gone before me had seen, the Sun-god, the great lord of E-Babara, the temple of the seat of the goodness of his heart, let me see, even me."
In the opinion, therefore, of Nabonidos, a king
who had a passion for investigating the past records
of his country, Naram-Sin reigned 3200 years before
his own time, that is to say, about B.C. 3700.
Before the rise of the Semitic kingdom of Sargon
of Accad, lies that earlier Accado-Sumerian period
when Babylonia was still in the hands of a people
who spoke an agglutinative language, such as those
of the modern Turks or Finns, and had originated
the cuneiform system of writing and the primitive
civilisation of the Chaldean cities. Relics of this
ancient period have been discovered by M. de
Sarzec in the mounds of Tel-loh, and the Sumerian
inscriptions which they bear are now being de
ciphered by French scholars, more especially by
M. Amiaud. M. Amiaud has been good enough
to introduce the historical documents of Babylonia
and Assyria to the readers of the present series
of Records of the Past, by his translations of these
oldest memorials of human life and thought in the
valley of the Euphrates. If Sargon of Accad lived
about B.C. 3800, the kings of Telloh must have
flourished as far back as the fourth millennium before
our era.



DYNASTIC TABLETS OF THE BABYLONIANS 7
The last chronological document brought to light
during the last few years is in many respects the
most important of all. This is what has been
termed " The Babylonian Chronicle " by its dis
coverer, Mr. Pinches, who gave an abstract of it in
the Proceedings of the Society of Biblical A rchceology,
6th May 1884. Since then, the text has been
published with a translation and commentary by
Dr. Winckler in the Zeitschrift fiir Assyriologie,
ii. 2,' 3 (1887); it has also been translated by
Dr. Oppert. The tablet (which is marked 84.
2-1 1, 356) was brought from Babylonia and is
inscribed on both sides with four columns of text.
It was a copy or compilation made by a Babylonian
in the reign of Darius from older records, and must
have been similar to the document from which
Ptolemy's Canon of Babylonian kings was extracted.
Like the latter it starts from the era of Nabonassar,
B.C. 747. The chronicle is written from a Babylonian point
of view, and must therefore be checked by contem
poraneous Assyrian inscriptions. What they de
scribe as Assyrian successes are sometimes passed
over altogether or represented as Babylonian vic
tories. The Assyrian kings Tiglath-Pileser III and
Shalmaneser IV are not acknowledged under the
names they had adopted from two of the most
illustrious monarchs of the first Assyrian empire,
but under their original names of Pul and Ululi ;
Sargon, on the other hand, whose name was that of



8 RECORDS OF THE PAST
the favourite hero of Babylonian legend, is known
by the same name in the Chronicle as he is on the
monuments of Assyria. At the same time the
Chronicle helps us in correcting the inaccuracies of
the Assyrian accounts, where, for example, Suzub
represents both Nergal-yusezib and Musezib-Mero
dach. In fact, it confirms the judgment, already
expressed by Assyriologists, that Sennacherib is the
least trustworthy of the royal historians of Assyria.
We are at present ignorant of the precise way in
which the Babylonians reckoned their chronology.
Tn Assyria the years were named after certain officers,
ordinarily known as eponyms, who were changed
each year, and as most of the institutions of Assyria
were derived from Babylonia it is very probable that
the system of counting time by the names of the
eponyms was also of Babylonian invention. How far
we can trust the dates assigned to the kings of the
earlier dynasties is open to question. The length of
reign assigned to the kings of the dynasties of the
sea and of Bit-Bazi in the Second and Third Dynastic
Tablets do not agree, while the number of regnal years
given to the several kings of the first dynasty of Babylon
not only plays on the same ciphers but is suspiciously
long. On the other hand, the contract-tablets be
longing to the time of Khammuragas imply that his
reign was not a short one.
There is evidence in a later part of the dynastic
lists that at least one name has been omitted. Dr.
Winckler has published (in the Zeitschrift filr As



DYNASTIC TABLETS OF THE BABYLONIANS 9
syriologie, ii. 3) the commencement of an inscription
from Babylonia (marked 83.1-18) belonging to a
certain king of Babylon, who calls himself Kuri-galzu
the son of Kara-Urus. Dr. Winckler shows that this
must be Kuri-galzu II, and that his name ought to
occur in the list between those of Kara-Urus and
Rimmon-nadin-suma. It is quite possible that other
reigns have fallen out in other parts of the lists.
The lacuna in the Second Dynastic Tablet be
tween the beginning of the eighth dynasty and the
commencement of the reign of Nabonassar unfor
tunately prevents us from determining with certainty
the date assigned by the compiler of it to 'Sumu-abi.
But there are two synchronisms between Babylonian
and Assyrian history which may serve to remedy the
defect. According to Sennacherib, Merodach-nadin
akhe defeated Tiglath-Pileser I, 418 years before his
own conquest of Babylon, that is to say, in B.C. 1106,
while the " Synchronous History " makes Assur-bil
kala, the son of Tiglath-Pileser I, the contem
porary of Merodach-sapik-kullat, and Assur-dan the
great-grandfather of Tiglath-Pileser I, the contem
porary of Zamama-nadin-suma, the father of Assurdan being contemporaneous with Rimmon-[sumanatsir .?]. If Merodach-nadin-akhe is the ninth king
of the dynasty of Isin, the date of Zamama-nadin
suma will be B.C. 1 160, agreeing very well with the
period to which the end of the reign of Assur-d^n
should be assigned. In this case Sagasalti-buryas,
who flourished 800 years before Nabonidos, will not



RECORDS OF THE PAST
be identical with the Saga-sal[tiyas] of the dynastic
list. The reign of Khammuragas will have com
menced B.C. 2282, the first dynasty of Babylon
establishing its power there in B.C. 2394.
We learn from the inscriptions of Khammuragas
that he was the first of his dynasty to rule over the
whole of Babylonia. A rival dynasty had previously
reigned at Karrak in the south, while the Elamites
had invaded portions of the country and probably
held them in subjection. Assur-bani-pal states that
the Elamite king Kudur - Nankhundi had carried
away the image of the goddess Nana from Babylonia
1635 years before his own time, or about B.C. 2285,
and contract -tablets refer to the conquest of "the lord of Elam and King Rim-Agu" of Karrak by
Khammuragas. A large number of contract-tablets,
indeed, belong not only to the reigns of Khammu
ragas and his son Samsu-iluna, but also to the reign
of Rim-Agu, who seems to have been master of the
greater part of Chaldaea before his overthrow by the
king of Babylon. George Smith was probably right
in identifying him with the son of the Elamite prince
Kudur- Mabug, who ruled at Larsa and claimed the
imperial title of " king of Sumer and Accad."
The rise of the empire of Khammuragas brought
with it a revival of learning and literature such as
had marked the rise of the empire of Sargon. The
calendar appears to have been reformed at this
period, and the great native work on astronomy and
astrology put into the shape in which it has come



DYNASTIC TABLETS OF THE BABYLONIANS ii
down to us. The reign thus formed an era some
what similar to that of Nabonassar, and it is therefore
curious to see how closely the date I have assigned
to it corresponds with that arrived at by von Gut
schmidt from classical sources for the beginning of
the Babylonian epoch. If the Latin translation can
be trusted (Simplicius ad Arist. de Ccelo, 503 A), the
astronomical observations sent by Kallisthenes from
Babylon to Aristotle in B.C. 331 reached back for
1903 years {i.e. to B.C. 2234). Berossos the Chaldean
historian, according to Pliny (N.H. vii. 57)) stated
that these observations commenced at Babylon 490
years before the Greek era of Phoroneus, and conse
quently in B.C. 2243. According to Stephanos of
Byzantium, Babylon was built 1002 years before the
date (given by Hellanikos) for the siege of Troy
(B.C. 1229), which would bring us to B.C. 2231, while
Ktesias, according to George Syncellus, made the
reign of Belos or Bel-Merodach last for fifty-five years
from B.C. 2286 to 2231. The fifty-five years of Belos
agree with the fifty-five of Khammuragas.

THE INSCRIPTIONS OF TELLOH
By M. Arthur Amiaud
The names of Telloh and of the French Consul M. de
Sarzec are no longer strange to the Orientalist of
to-day. The situation of the mounds, which have
hidden and preserved to our day the ruins of one of
the most ancient centres of civilisation, is well known.
The history of the excavations has been often written,
and I shall not dwell upon it. Nor shall I discuss
the results of these excavations from the point of view
of art or archaeology. This work has been undertaken
by a master hand in the Dkoiivertes en Chaldee} At
present I shall only essay to follow in the steps of
Dr. Oppert by making the monuments of stone and
brick tell their own tale, and by questioning them
summarily on the geography, history, politics, and
religion of their age and country.^
I. The first question one thinks of asking is what
was the name of that flourishing city of ancient
Chaldsea which the Bedouin now knows only as
' See also M. L^on Heuzey's Un. Palais Chaldden (Paris, Leroux, 1888). '^ On all these points, see Honimel's Gcschichte Babylonicns und Assyricns (Berlin, 1885-87).



THE INSCRIPTIONS OF TELLOII 43
Telloh ? Considering that all the princes whose
names occur on the monuments are entitled "kings"
or " patesis" of Sliirpicrla-ki, it was generally answered
at first : This city was Shirpurla.-' As often hap
pens, the first impression has proved to be correct.
I was wrong in questioning the identification in an
article in the Zeitschrift fur Keilschriftforsclmng
(i. p. 151). I had remarked that except in the title
of the kings and patesis the name of Shirpurla-ki
appeared very rarely in the inscriptions of Telloh,
and that whenever a prince mentioned the site where
a temple was erected he gave it another name

Girsu-ki, Uru-azagga, Nina-ki, Gishgalla-ki. I now
believe, and shall attempt to prove, that Telloh really
represents the ruins of Shirpurla; that it was the
general name of a great centre of population, of which
Girsu-ki, Uru-azagga, Nina-ki, and Gishgalla-ki were
only divisions or quarters.
Let us first remove a hypothesis which could pre
sent itself to the mind. Might not Shirpurla be the
name of a country, of which Girsu-ki and the three
other cities mentioned above were the chief places .?
This supposition is forbidden by the inscription of
the statue F of Gudea, which states formally that
Shirpurla was the beloved "city" of the goddess
Gatumdug (col. i., cases 15, 16). It is also forbidden
1 According to Mr. Pinches {Guidi to the Kouytmjik Gallery, London,
1885, p. 7, note 2), Shir-pur-la-ki would be an ideographic mode of
writing the word Lagash. We should then perhaps have to compare
W. A. I. , ii. 52, a 60, which seems to connect a city Lagashu-ki with Urama
or "Ur" (?).



44 RECORDS OF THE PAST
by W. A. I., ii. 6i, 2, 37, where we learn that a temple
otherwise unknown was situated in Shirpurla-ki.
The list of temples given in this passage might
open the door to another hypothesis, which must be
removed in its turn, for it would be inconsistent with
the relations existing between Shirpurla and the four
other towns. In lines 34 and 35 two temples are
named as temples of Girsu-ki. If Girsu-ki had been
only a quarter of Shirpurla, would there not be some
inconsistency on the part of the Assyrian scribe in
saying : Such and such temples belong to Girsu-ki,
such another to Shirpurla-ki ? Might one not con
clude that Shirpurla and the four other towns were
separate cities ?
Now it is certain that Gudea tells us (in the
inscription on statue C) that he has constructed the
temple of E-anna for the goddess Ninni or Istar in
Girsu-ki (col. 3, cases 11, 12). We further know that
the same Istar, the presiding deity of Erech, had a
celebrated temple in that city which also bore the
name of E-anna. Moreover, certain texts of Gudea
and Dungi, which mention the construction of temples
in Girsu-ki, come, it is believed, from other sites
than Telloh, some from Warka or Erech, others from
Babylon, from Zerghul and from Tel-Eed. But this
proves nothing in favour of Erech, and still less against
Telloh. From the fact that Istar had a temple named
E-anna at Erech, we cannot infer that the same god
dess had not a temple of the same name in another
city. We know that Nebo had a temple called



THE INSCRIPTIONS OF TELIOH 45
E-Zida in Borsippa, and there were at least two others of the same name at Babylon and Calah.
We cannot look for Nina-ki, any more than Girsii
ki, outside Telloh, or identify it with the Assyrian
Nineveh.i As for the inscription cited by Dr. Hommel
in support of the contrary view, the Museum of the
Louvre possesses several similar ones discovered by
M. de Sarzec at Telloh. If the text translated by
Dr. Hommel does not come from Telloh, it must have
been moved from its original place, like the tablet of
black stone, with a Semitic inscription of Dungi,
believed to have been found at Nineveh, and accord
ingly quoted by Dr. Hommel to show that the empire of the kings of Ur extended as far as that city. The
text itself of the inscription, imperfectly copied by
Lenormant, proves that its primitive resting-place was
Cutha.^ But yet more. Two princes of Shirpurla,
Uru-Kagina in his barrel-inscription, and Gudea in the
cylinder-inscription A, state that they have worked
upon a canal, Nina-ki-tum-a, "the favourite river of
the goddess Nina." In order to find this canal I
believe it will be useless to ascend as far as the
Khausser, the river of Nineveh, if we compare with
the context these lines of M. de Sarzec : " In going
from the Shatt-el-Hal to the ruins, at 500 metres
from the enceinte of Telloh we meet with the bed of
an immense canal, still visible, though filled with
sand, running from N.W. to S.E. It is possibly the
^ The pronunciation of the name of the goddess Nina and of the city called after her is still problematical. 2 See the Zeitschriftfiir Assyriologie, iii., p. 94.



45 RECORDS OF THE PAST
original channel of the Shatt-el-Hal, possibly also
some canal derived from that great artery, and intended
to supply the city with water." ^
Uru-azagga and Gishgalla-ki still remain. The
first must be sought near Telloh, if not in Telloh
itself, since M. de Sarzec has found in the ruins : (i)
at least one brick commemorating the erection by
Gudea of a temple of the goddess Gatumdug situated
in Uru-azagga ; ^ (2) the forepart of a lion or griffon
of calcareous stone, which bears the same inscription
as the brick of Gudea, some insignificant variants
excepted ; ' (3) a doorstep of the patesi Nammaghini,
intended for the temple of the goddess Bau, which the
inscriptions on several statues of Gudea place in Uru
azagga;* (4) a buttress of the patesi Entena intended for
the temple of the goddess Gatumdug in Uru-azagga.*
As for Gishgalla-ki, which is known only from two
passages in the inscription on the statue of Ur-Bau,
one of which calls the patesi " servant of the divine
king of Gishgalla-ki," and the other places in Gish
galla-ki a temple of the goddess Ninni, its name even
remains an obscure problem. It must have been
some locality in Telloh or its immediate vicinity.
Otherwise the inscription of Ur-Bau would offer us
the only example in our texts of a foreign temple
constructed by the princes of Shirpurla, and the sole
' Dicouvertes en Chaldie, p. 12. - Not yet published. ' I owe ray knowledge of this fact, as well as of several others, to the kindness of M. Heuzey. ** Dicouvertes en Chaldie, pi, 27, i. ^ Not yet published.



jnR uMacKimoNS of telloh 47
example also of the title of "servant" of a foreign god assumed by one of them.
It will now be easy for me to show that the four
centres, Girsu-ki, Uru-azagga, Nina-ki, and Gishgalla
ki, were only quarters . of a large city, which bore the
name of Shirpurla-ki. Whenever the princes who
have reigned at Telloh wished to indicate the whole
of their capital or their domain, we shall see that they
called it Shirpurla-ki. Only when they preferred to
mark the extent of their domain by means of its
extreme or most important points, or when they
wanted to indicate a particular spot, they employed
the names Girsu-ki, Uru-azagga, Nina-ki, and Gish
galla-ki.
It is thus that all call themselves " kings" or
"patesis"of Shirpurla-ki. There is but one excep
tion, and only in one of the three inscriptions he has
left us ; Uru-Kagina entitles himself on his cylinder
"king of Girsu-ki." This exception can be easily
explained, since Girsu-ki was without doubt the most
important quarter of Shirpurla. It is thus again that
Gudea, wishing to inform us what were the distant
countries from which he derived the materials neces
sary for the buildings of his capital, expresses himself
as follows : " By the power of Nini and Nin-girsu, to
Gudea who holds his sceptre from Nin-Girsu, the
countries of Migan, Melughgha, Gubi, and Nituk, rich
in trees of every species, have sent him at Shirpurla-ki
ships laden with all sorts of trees" (statue D, col. 4).
Thus, too, if I understand the passage rightly, after



48 RECORDS OF THE PAST
having enumerated the reforms which followed his
accession to the throne, he describes the peace result
ing therefrom to his country : " On the territory of
Shirpurla-ki no one has sued him who has right
on his side ; a brigand has entered the house of no
one" (statue B, col. 5).
But if the same Gudea wants to insist on the peace
which he has given his country, and to prove that no
part of his city was excluded from his care, he tells
us: "Gudea, patesi of Shirpurla-ki, has proclaimed
peace from Girsu-ki to Uru-azagga" (statue G, col. 2).
So, too, in describing the position of a temple, the
princes of Telloh never say that it was situated in
Shirpurla, but more precisely in Girsu-ki, in Uru
azagga, in Nini-ki, or in Gishgalla-ki.
It is very difficult at present to determine the
approximate situation in Telloh of these different
quarters. I will, however, make some suggestions in
regard to them.
The four tels or mounds on the west side of Telloh
perhaps represent the site of Nina-ki. From one of
them M. de Sarzec has recovered the beautiful bull
and the tablet of black stone which bear the name of
Dungi, and mention the erection of the temple of the
goddess Nini. All the other tels, including the great
tel on which stood the palace, appear to have formed
part of Girsu-ki. It is in this region that bronzes
and votive tablets have been discovered with the
names of the god Nin-Girsu and of his sons Gal-alim
and Dun-shagina ; now we cannot doubt, though we



THE mS&gJFUONS OF TELLOH 49
are not directly assured of it, that the temples of
these three gods were situated in Girsu-ki. As for
Uru-azagga, it is not certain that it lay in the part of
Telloh excavated by M. de Sarzec. With the exception
of some statues, which have certainly not been found
in their original position, the monuments intended,
according to their inscriptions, for this quarter of
Shirpurla-ki are little numerous ; and some, if not
all, appear to have been displaced, and, to use the
expression of M. Heuzey, to have been replaced by
the successive occupants of Telloh, which was still in
habited in the Parthian epoch. Nothing can be said
concerning Gishgalla-ki, which is mentioned only on
the statue of Ur-Bau. II. We now possess the names of twelve or thirteen
princes of Shirpurla, four or five of whom bear the
title of "king," and eight the title of "patesi." M.
Heuzey has shown by arguments derived from the
more archaic character of their monuments and writ
ing that the most ancient of these princes were the
kings. He has also established that among the
patesis the group comprising Entena and En-anna
tumma was the oldest. The script used by these
patesis is still linear like that of the kings, and not
yet cuneiform like that of the later princes. Of
course I refer only to the inscriptions engraved on
hard materials, bronze or stone. For we possess a
clay cylinder of the king Uru-Kagina, where the
wedge already appears as distinctly as on the bricks
and cylinders of Gudea. We know that it is just by
VOL. I E



50 RECORDS OF THE PAST
the form of the stylus employed by the scribes when
writing upon soft clay that the wedge which charac
terises the cuneiform script is explained. It is by
imitation only that it has passed from writing on clay
to writing on stone.
The dynasties of Telloh were the following :
(i) Kings of Shirpurla-ki :

The earliest king known is perhaps Ur-Nini, " the
man of Nina," of whom we have three inscriptions.
This prince was the son of a personage called Nini
ghal-gin (the reading Ghal-gin being uncertain). It is
doubtful whether Nini-ghal-gin had himself been king,
since his son never gives him the title of sovereign.
After Ur-Nina, according to the " Stele of the Vul
tures," his son, A-Kurgal (" the son of Bel " .') reigned.
Another passage in the Stel^ of the Vultures
appears to mention a certain Igi-ginna (" he who goes
before ") as king of Shirpurla.
So far as we can judge from the writing, it was
after these monarchs that Uru-kagina reigned,^ whose
three inscriptions have come down to us. Two of
them call him " king of Shirpurla " ; in a third, on a
clay cylinder, he bears, as was first recognised by Dr.
Oppert, the title of " king of Girsu-ki." ^
(2) Patesis of Shirpurla-ki :

The first series comprises three patesis, whose suc
' See Heuzey : " Un nouveau roi de Tello," in the Revue Archdologique of 1884. - It would seem that a prince more ancient than Uru-Kagina and perhaps as ancient as Ur-Ninft bore the title of " patesi" and not of " king." But his name still remains unknown. See below, p. 67.



THE INSCRIPTIONS OF TELLOH 51
cession cannot at present be exactly determined.
The museum of the Louvre possesses a portion of a
buttress inscribed with the name of a patesi Entena,
who does not record the name of his father, and
another block bearing the name of a patesi En-anna
tumma, son of a patesi Entena. As the British
Museum possesses a block inscribed by a patesi
Entena, son of a patesi En-anna-tumma, we have a
choice of two hypotheses. Either the patesi Entena
of the British Museum is the same as the patesi
Entena of the Louvre, in which case the succession will be: En-anna-tumma I, Entena, and En-anna
tumma II ; or else the Entena of the British Museum
is the grandson of that of the Louvre, the order of the
patesis being Entena I, En-anna-tumma, Entena II.
Later in date than this family of princes comes
the patesi Ur-Bau (" man of Bau ") whose statue is in
the Louvre, together with a number of monuments
of less importance.
A short time after Ur-Bau comes Gudea (" the
elect"), followed by his son and probable successor
Ur-Nin-girsu (" man of Nin-girsu ")} It is of Gudea
that the larger and more important part of the monu
ments of Telloh preserve the memory : eight statues,
two large cylinders of clay, and hundreds of frag
ments or small texts. Of his successor we have a
few bricks and a small object of uncertain use.
Here must be placed, I believe, the patesi Nam
1 Cf. Ledrain : Communication a. V Acadimie des Inscriptions et BellesLettres, 12th July i88z.



52 RECORDS OF THE PAST
maghini (" His supremacy") whose reign is assigned
by Dr. Hommel to a period before Ur-Bau. But
. his monuments are too few (only a door-step and
some bricks) to allow us to determine with certainty
his relative date.
M. Heuzey has also made us acquainted with an
other patesi, Luka-ni (" His glory ")} His son Ghala
lamma, who does not, like his father, take the title of
patesi, ofifers homage in an inscription on the fragment
of a statue to Dungi, king of Ur.^
It is difficult to determine, even approximately, to
what remote epoch the dynasties of Telloh must be
referred. We gather but little from the fact that the
son of one of the last patesis of Shirpurla was the con
temporary of Dungi. For we cannot yet fix the age of
the early kings of Ur. Let me, however, hazard a
hypothesis, in consideration of any light it may throw
on the dark problem of Chaldean chronology.
I have already had occasion to cite an inscription
of Gudea (on statue D) in which this patesi tells us
that he received from "the countries of M^gan, Me

of trees. The situation of Nituk is known. It was
the Isle of Tilmun^ in the Persian Gulf. It is not
^ " Le Roi Dounghi " in the Revue Archdologique, April 1886. ^ I omit a patesi of Shirpurla, En-anna, made known to us by George Smith in his Early History of Babylonia, and two other patesis whose
names are quoted by Dr. Hommel from some seals (Geschichle Bad. und Ass., pp. ago, 293). The text translated by George Smith has not yet been published, and the reading of the inscriptions on the seals does not seem absolutely certain. •' [Identified with the Tylos of classical geography by Dr. Oppert, and with the modern Bahrein by Sir H. Rawlinson, though Professor Delitzsch

possible, in my opinion, to look for M^gan and Me
lughgha anywhere else than in the vicinity of the
Sinaitic Peninsula.^ Gubi, sometimes written Gubin,
alone remains, which Dr. Hommel would identify
with Byblos in Phcenicia, the Gapuna of the hiero
glyphic texts. I should, however, prefer to see in
Gubi a name of Egypt, and more precisely the name
of Coptos, the ancient Qubti. Gudea would thus in
his list of names have followed the route of his
vessels, starting from the most distant points to the
north of the Red Sea, coasting along Egypt and
turning round Arabia. If the identification of Gubi
or Gubin with Qubti meets with the approval
of Egyptologists and Assyriologists, the reign of
Gudea might perhaps be placed in the interval
between the sixth Egyptian dynasty, when the
monuments of Pepi seem already to testify to the
commercial importance of Coptos,^ and the eleventh,
when the cities of Upper Egypt obtained political
supremacy. No one of course will dream of bringing
the reign of Gudea down to a later date.
How must we explain the fact that the last princes
of Shirpurla contented themselves with the title of
" patesi," while the most ancient took that of " king " .?
I believe that it is difficult not to see in this fact an
indication of the loss of its earlier independence on
considers it to form part of the delta which has accumulated at the mouth of the Euphrates.

Ed.'X 1 This is the opinion long ago maintained by Messrs. Lenormanl, Oppert, and Sayce. M. Delattre has ably defended it in the memoir LAsie occidentale dans les Inscriptions Assyriennes, pp. 149 seq. 2 See Maspero : Histoire ancienne (4th edit,), p. 81.



54 RECORDS OF THE PAST
the part of Shirpurla and of its subjection to some other
city, probably Ur. All the other instances we have of
the use of the title of " patesi," lend it the sense of "lieu
tenant" before the name of a country, of "vicar" before
a divine name.^ We possess inscriptions in which the
patesis of Nipur and of Ishkun-Sin acknowledge their
dependency on the kings of Ur. Nebuchadnezzar II
calls himself the patesi of the god Merodach, Sargon
the patesi of the god Assur. The title of the earliest
sovereigns of Assyria, "patesi of the god Assur,"
defines their power as being that either of a king
dom predominantly religious, or of a viceroyalty
under a suzerain, who was without doubt Babylonian.
It always implies the idea of lieutenant or dependant.
Why should we admit an exception in the case of
Shirpurla .? It is true that Gudea comes before us as
a powerful prince. In one of his inscriptions (statue
B) he boasts of having overthrown the city of Anshan
in the land of Elam. But for aught we know he
may have made this expedition in the company of
his suzerain. Dependence, moreover, admits of de
grees, and it can even be purely nominal. France
has known powerful vassals who have resisted
royalty.
III. The campaign of Gudea in Elam, in the course
of which the city of Anshan was captured, is the only
fact of military history of which we know. We have
a little better information, thanks to two inscriptions
' [I should rather render it " Iligh-Priesl." Sec my Lectures ou the Religion of the A?icient Babylonians, pp. 59-60. --/?(/.]



THE INSCRIPTIONS OF TELL OH 55
of the same patesi (those of statue B and cyhnder A),
concerning the commercial relations of his country.
Unfortunately it is always very difficult to identify the
geographical names recorded in the texts.
From a passage cited above it appears that Shir
purla enjoyed commercial intercourse with the coun
tries of Nituk, Gubi or Gubin, Magan, and Melughgha.
These four countries furnished Chaldsea with wood for
building. But Melughgha also furnished gold, and
Magan a hard stone, diorite, which was employed by
the sculptors. Chaldsea was also in connection with the
country of Martu, that is to say, with Phoenicia and
Syria. From a mountain which seems to have been
Amanus, it derived cedars and other trees ; from two
other mountains of Martu—Susalla and Tidanum -^

two species of stones. It is stones again that were
imported from a mountain of Barsip, which I should
look for in the neighbourhood of the Syrian city of
Til-Barsip. For I believe that it is the same country
as that which appears in W. A. I., ii. 53, a 3, under
the varying forms of Barsip-ki and Bursip-ki. We
know that the nam.e of Til-Barsip was also written
Til-Bursip. The inscription of statue B, moreover,
tells us that the stones coming from Barsip were con
veyed in vessels which, according to my view, would
have had only to descend the Euphrates. I am greatly
tempted to ascend still farther to the north, towards
the sources of this river, in order to find two other coun
1 The reading Susalla is uncertain. Dr. Homniel has compared Tidanum with Tidnu, the Sumerian equivalent of Akharru (the Semitic term for Syria).



S6 liECORDS OF THE PAST
tries—the city of Ursu-ki, in the mountains of Ibla (or
rather, Tilla ^), which furnished wood, and Shamalum,
or Shamanum, in the mountains of Menua, which fur
nished stones. But I can suggest nothing in regard
to three other geographical names which I shall con
fine myself to mentioning : the mountain of Ghaghum,
from whence Gudea procured gold ; the city of Abullat
or Abulia-Abishu (" the great gate of his fathers "),
situated in the mountains of Ki-mash,^ whence he
procured copper ; and the country or city of Madga,
in the mountains of the river Gurruda (?),^ from whence
he procured a product whose precise nature I am
unable to determine.
Certain cities of Babylonia are mentioned in our
texts. They are the three ancient cities of Eridu
{Nnn-ki), Larrak {Barbar-ki), and the unknown city
of Kinunir-ki. They always appear to figure as
sacred cities, and the last of the three only after the
name of a goddess, Duzi-abzu, "the mistress of
Kinunir."
The names of the Euphrates and Tigris frequently
occur on the two cylinders of Gudea. I believe I
have also found in them the names of Shumer and
Accad—" Kiengfi " and " Ki-burbur." But it is not
' Dr. Hommel has proposed to read Dalla. ^ [Ki-mash seems to be "the country of Mas," or Arabia Petroea
;
comp. the Mash of Genesis x. 23. The Babylonians derived a name for "copper," kemassii, from its Sumerian appellation.

Ed."\ ' Can the river Gurruda have been the Dead Sea, and can the product derived from the neighbouring district have been bitumen, as Dr. Hommel has conjectured ? It is not probable that all the bitumen required for the buildings of Babylonia was exclusively provided by the little river of Hit. (.SeeHdt. i. 179.)



THE INSCRIPTIONS OF TELLOH 57
yet possible for me to translate the passages where
they are found.
The inscription of statue B mentions two seas.
"After he had caused the temple of Nin-girsu to be
built, Nin-girsu, the lord beloved by him, has forcibly
opened for him the roads from the sea of the high
lands to the lower sea." The "sea of the highlands "
is evidently the Persian Gulf, and it is impossible to
doubt that by the " lower sea " is intended the Medi
terranean.
IV. For a knowledge of the pantheon of Shirpurla
ki we possess a document of a very great value.
This is the list of divinities at the commencement of
the imprecatory formula in the inscription on statue B
of Gudea. The following are the names of the divi
nities, which it is important to give in the order,
evidently sacred, in which they are enumerated in
the inscription:

Anna, the Sky-god, the Anu of the Semites
;
Ellilla or Bel, " the lord of the mountain of the world," ^
where the seat of the gods was placed, as well as the
habitation of the dead, also called " the father of the
gods ; " Nin-gharsag or Belit, " the mistress of the
mountain," the wife of Ellilla, and mother of the gods ;
En-ki or Ea, " the lord of the earth" and the waters
;
En-zu, or Sin, the Moon-god, the eldest son of
Ellilla ; Nin-girsu or Ninib, the Chaldean Hercules,
the son and ^varrior of Ellilla ; Nini, the daughter of
Ea, who has the same titles as Nin-dara, and may
1 In an abbreviated form, '
' the lord of the world.



S8 RECORDS OF THE PAST
therefore be regarded as the consort of this god
;
Nin-dara, who is the god Ninib i under another name ;
Gatumdug, the daughter of Anna, who is the goddess
Bau under another name ; Bau, daughter of Anna
and wife of Nin-girsu ; Ninni or Nana, the Ishtar of
the Semites, another daughter of Anna ; Shamash,
the Sun-god, the son of En-ki or Ea ; Pasagga, the
Ishum of the Semites, who is undoubtedly only an
other form of Gibil, the Fire-god, the son of En-ki or
Ea;
Gal-alim, the son of Nin-girsu ; Dun-shagana,
another son of Nin-girsu ; Nin-mar-ki, the eldest
daughter of Nina ;
Duzi-abzu, " lady of Kinunir-ki ; " Nin-gish-zida,
the god of Gudea.
It will be observed that this list arranges the
divinities in three generations. In the first come the
four great gods, including a goddess, distinguished
also by the later Assyro-Babylonian religious systems,
and from whom all the other gods proceed. Next
are placed the sons and daughters of these deities.
Lastly come the grandchildren. I have been obliged
to put Duzi-abzu and Nin-gish-zida by themselves,
since no text has as yet given us any information con
cerning them.2 But we may believe that one of them

Nin-gish-zida— must be mentioned at the end of the
> [Or Uras.— ^rf.]
^ If our Duzi-abzu is a goddess—and lier title of '
' lady of Kinunir-ki
"
does not allow us to doubt it —it is clear that we cannot identify her with
the god Duzi-abzu who is named in W. A. I., ii. 56, 33-38, as one of the six sons of Ea. It is necessary to understand six sons in this passage, and not six children, since the following line names " a daughter" of Ea.



THE INSCRIPTIONS OF TELLOH 59
list, whatever may have been his rank in the divine
family, since, as we shall see, he was the special deity
of Gudea and his intercessor with the other gods.
The preceding list does not give all the gods
mentioned in the texts of Telloh ; some even are
absent who had their temples in Shirpurla. Without
pretending to be complete, I may further enumerate
the god Nin-agal, who is only another form of En-ki
;
the god Shidlamta-ena, another name of Nin-girsu,
and the Nergal of the Semites ; the god Nin-sar, yet
another name of Nergal ; the goddess Nin-tu, another
designation of Nin-gharsag ; the god Uru-ki or Sin ;
the god Nirba; perhaps the god Nin-shagh, Pap-sukal;
a god called the "king" of Gishgalla-ki ; a goddess
Ku-anna; a god Dun-sir (?)-anna ; seven sons of
Bau, who are termed Zazaru (or Zazauru), Im-ghud
ena, Ur-un-ta-ena (or Gim-nun-ta-ena), Ghi-gir-nunna,
Ghi-shaga, Gurmu, and Zarmu.
In a learned article in the Zeitschrift fiir Assyri
ologie (ii. pp. 179 seq?), Prof. Tiele has shown that at
Babylon, by the side of the local god Bel-Merodach
and even in his temple of E-shagil, his wife and son
Zarpanit and Nebo were also adored ; that at Bor
sippa, by the side of the supreme god Nebo and in
his temple of ^^-Zida, his consort Nana was wor
shipped. If we remember that other temples existed
at Babylon dedicated to various other deities, we shall
readily admit that the cult rendered to these gods
was offered by reason of their being the mother, the
brothers, or the sisters of the principal divinity. We



6o RECORDS OF THE PAST
may remark, moreover, that the supreme god of the
national or local pantheon was hardly ever one of the
primordial deities. The latter, indeed, appear to me
to have been born after their sons, in consequence of
the need experienced by the mind of man to establish
for his god a family analogous to his own, with
parents, wife, and children. The two exceptions
which may be instanced from Nipur and Eridu ace
not certain. Dr. Hommel has remarked that one text
at all events names Ninib and not Bel as the chief
divinity of Nipur. As for Eridu, I do not feel sure
that the principal deity there was really Ea. This
god had certainly a temple in Eridu, just as he had
at Shirpurla-ki, but in both cities it was under the title
of the divine father that he was adored. The very
interesting inscription on a brick of a patesi of Eridu,
named Idadu, which is unfortunately still unpublished,
would lead us to suppose that the chief god of the
place was Nin-Eridu, possibly a name of Merodach.^
The supreme god of Shirpurla was Nin-girsu,
whose consort was the goddess Bau. Both were
worshipped under different titles. Besides the temples
in which he was invoked as Nin-girsu, he had others
in Girsu-ki, where he was known as Nin-dara and
Shidlamta-ena. Similarly the goddess was not only
adored as Bau, but she was also worshipped in Uru
azagga as Gatumdug and in Nin^-ki as Nina. Three
at least of the parent gods had sanctuaries in Shir

THE INSCRIPTIONS OF TELLOH 6i
purla,— EUilla (called specially "the father of Nin
girsu")^ En-ki, and "the mother of the gods," Nin
gharsag. Temples were even dedicated to En-ki
under his two titles of En-ki and Nin-agal. We may
question whether it was in virtue of her being his wife
or his sister that Ninni possessed a temple in Girsu
ki and another in Gishgalla-ki ; and also whether Nin
gish-zida, in his special temple at Girsu-ki, was wor
shipped as being a brother of the god or as being the
god himself under a fourth manifestation. It is cer
tain.on the other hand, that Gal-alim and Dun-shagana
had each a temple because they were the sons of
Nin-girsu, and that Nin-mar-ki had one because she
was the daughter of Nina. We do not know at pre
sent what were the grounds of relationship which
caused temples to be erected in Girsu-ki to the god
desses Ku-anna^ and Duzi-abzu. It is possible that
some of these numerous temples were only chapels
situated in ^l-ninnu, the favourite sanctuary of Nin
girsu ; those, for example, which belonged to the sons
of the god. While regarding Nin-girsu as the supreme object
of his cult, as " his king," to use the stereotyped ex
pression, each prince of Shirpurla-ki selected also a
special deity from among the divine family, who acted
as his intercessor with Nin-girsu.^ We are acquainted
with the deities of five of these princes. That of Uru

114. Cf. W. A. I., iii. 67, b 35.
2 See more especially the last lines of inscription No. i of King Uru
Kagina. M. Heuzey has drawn my attention to the lines, which have been translated for the first time by Dr. Oppert.



62 RECORDS OF THE PAST
Kagina was perhaps Nin-shagh or Pap-sukal—though
the reading is doubtful ; that of Entena and Enanna-tumma was Dun-sir(?)-anna ; that of Ur-Bau
was Nin-agal ; that of Gudea, Nin-gish-zida.
We have not yet succeeded in ascertaining the
exact sense of the various appellations of Nin-girsu
and his wife Bau ; it is consequently impossible to
define with precision the character and personality
of these divinities. We may admit, however, that
Nin-girsu was a solar deity, personifying more par
ticularly the sun when veiled in clouds ; hence the
combative and military aspect of the god. Like
Apollo, with whom he would be more fitly compared
than with Hercules, he was at once an avenger and
a saviour, a huntsman, and perhaps a shepherd.
As for Bau, who was termed " the mother " par ex
cellence, and to whom were given the titles of " good
lady," " Mistress of Abundance," she was a terrestrial
divinit}?^, resembling in many points the Demeter of
the Greeks. It is even possible that like Demeter
she presided also over Hades, and not only over the
living and fertile earth. Two of our texts mention
a festival of Bau, which occurred, if I understand the
passage aright, at the commencement of the year
;
and it appears to result from another inscription that
the chief festival of Nin-girsu took place at the same
time. Indeed it is probable that it was at the be
ginning of the year, at the vernal equinox, that the
cities of Babylonia and Assyria alike celebrated the
festivals of their gods.

SIN-GASHID'S ENDOWMENT OF THE TEMPLE :&-ANA
Translated by Theo. G. Pinches
This short inscription of twenty-seven lines is one
of peculiar interest. It is a record, written in the
Akkadian language, of an endowment, made by an
early Mesopotamian king with a Semitic Babylonian
name, to the great temple at Erech called £-ana;^
and it is not an original, but a copy in clay, written by
a man named Nabd-baladhsu-iqbi, of a stone tablet
kept, in ancient times, in the great temple known as
fe-zida, now the ruin called the Birs-i-Nimroud—the
supposed tower of Babel. Great care has been taken
by the copyist in inscribing the tablet; and the forms
of the characters, as he has given them, probably
reproduce fairly well the archaic style of the original.
The text itself covers the greater part of the two
sides of the clay tablet, which is, like most of the
documents of this kind found in Babylonia and
Assyria, flat — or nearly so — on the obverse, and
curved on the reverse. The last three lines, which

are separate from the others, are written smaller, and
are in the later Babylonian style of writing. Unlike
the rest, also, they are written in the Semitic-Baby
lonian language. The size of the tablet is 4^ inches
by 2|- inches, the thickness in the thickest part being
i^ inch. The colour is a very light yellow ochre.
As the word-order in Akkadian differs consider
ably from English, no attempt is made to preserve
the divisions of the lines of the original ; by this
arrangement translations from these ancient tongues
are much more easily understood.

The text begins with an invocation to Lugal
banda and his consort Nin-gul, who seem to have
been Sin-gashid's patron god and goddess. He then
speaks of £l-ana, one of the great temples of Erech
(which was, perhaps, Sin-gashid's capital), and 6-kan
kal, probably one of the shrines in £-ana. Judging
from the wording, Sin-gashid seems to claim to be
the founder of both those fanes, though it is probable
that he only rebuilt them. Sin-gashid then gives a
list of the amounts of produce, etc., with which he
had endowed the shrine, and ends with a pious wish
for his country. The date of the original of this in
scription may be set down at about 2600 B.C. The
copy which has come down to us, however, probably
dates from the time of the antiquarian revival in
Babylonia during the reign of Nabonidus, father of
Belshazzar.

82 RECORDS OF THE PAST
It is to be noted that the inscription is dedicated
to a god and a goddess whose names I provisionally
transcribe as Lugal-banda ("powerful king," or "king
of youthful strength ") and Nin-gul, his consort (as
we learn from the second volume of the Cuneiform
Inscriptions of Western Asia, pi. 59, 11. 24 and 25 ').
This identification of Ningul as the consort of Lugal
banda is important, as it shows that Sin-gashid, who
calls her his mother, and himself her son,^ did not
mean to imply that she was his real earthly parent,
but that he simply traced his descent from her, thus
asserting his divine origin. The late George Smith's
double-queried " Belat-sunat " (as he transcribed the
name Nin-gul), " the earliest known queen in the
Euphrates valley," must therefore be erased from the
list of historical rulers in Erech.
The temple £-ana was probably the principal
fane in the city of Erech, and ifc-kankal ^ was prob
ably one of the shrines within it. It is not improb
able that the E-kankal mentioned here is the same
as, or the fellow-shrine to, the ll-ghili-ana mentioned
by Assur-bani-pal as the sanctuary, apparently in or
connected with ^-ana, to which he restored the
image of the goddess Nana, which was carried off
by the king of Elam, Kudur-nankhundi, about 2280
' From a comparison of the other names in the text there published, it would seem that other possible readings of these two names are Umunbanda or (/n-banda and lyn-gul or &-gul. Fresh excavations in the East can alone determine these points. ^ Cun. Ins. of W. Asia, vol. i. pi. 3, No. viii. (Brick from the summit of the Bowarieh ruin at Warka). '

years before Christ. As the date of Sin-gashid is
doubtful,^ it is impossible to say with certainty
whether the capture of the image of Nana by the
Elamites took place before or after his reign, but
it was probably after.^
The inscription here translated and explained is
a duplicate of one published in the fourth volume of
the Cuneiform Ins. of W. Asia, pi. 35, No. 3, from two cones from Warka.^ Of this text, which is
rather roughly written, and which gives a few inter
esting variants from the text translated above, a
tentative translation was given by the late George
Smith in his " Early History of Babylonia," pub
lished in the Transactions of the Society of Biblical
ArchcBology, vol. i., and in the first series of the
Records of the Past, vol. iii.
' He may be regarded as having reigned about 2600 B.C.
2 Tlie text of Assur-bani-pal's description is as follows :— "For 1635
years had the goddess Nana been angry, had gone, and had dwelt within Elam, which was not her proper place ; and in those days she and the gods her fathers proclaimed my name to the dominion of the world. She intrusted to me the return of her divinity thus : ' Assur-bani-pal shall bring me out of the midst of wicked Elam, and shall cause me to enter within E-ana.' The words of the command of her divinity, which she had spoken from remote days, she again revealed to the later people. I grasped the hand of her great divinity, and she took the straight road, with joy of heart, to li-ana. In the month Kisleu, on the first day, I caused her to enter Erech, and in E-ghili-ana, which she loves, I caused an everlasting shrine to be founded for her." ^ The ancient Erech, in which the temple E-ana was situated.



AN ERECHITE'S LAMENT
Translated by Theo. G. Pinches
In connection with the text referring to ]fc-ana in
Erech, the following, a kind of penitential psalm
written in the Sumerian dialect, with a translation
into Semitic-Babylonian, which I have entitled " The
Erechite's lament over the desolation of his father
land," may be here very appropriately appended.
This interesting composition, if not actually written
and sung after the carrying away of the statue of the
goddess Nana by the Elamities, might well have
been chanted by the sorrowing Erechites on that
occasion.
The fragment as published {Cun. Ins. of W. Asia,
iv. 1 9, No. 3) begins with the reverse of the text, and
breaks off when rather less than half-way through it.
Of the obverse, which is as yet unpublished, the re
mains only of about sixteen lines at the bottom are
left. What remains of the obverse refers to the
devastation wrought by an enemy in the city of
Erech, and the subject is continued on the reverse,
which ends in a kind of litany. The following is a
free rendering of the inscription on the reverse.



AN ERECHITE'S LAMENT 85
Translation of the Lament
How long, my Lady, shall the strong enemy hold thy sanctuary ? There is want in Erech, thy principal city
;
Blood is flowing like water in E-ulbar, the house of thy oracle
;
He has kindled and poured out fire like hailstones on all thy lands. My Lady, sorely am I fettered by misfortune;
My Lady, thou hast surrounded me, and brought me to
grief. The mighty enemy has smitten me down like a single reed. Not wise myself, I cannot take counsel ; ' I mourn day and night like the fields.^ I, thy servant, pray to thee. Let thy heart take rest, let thy disposition be softened. weeping, let thy heart take rest. let thy heart take rest. save (?) thou.

and a drawing of the reverse of the fragment, accom
panied with a transcription and translation, was given

INSCRIPTION OF TIGLATH-PILESER I
KING OF ASSYRIA
Translated by The Editor
This inscription of Tiglath-Pileser I. is the longest
and most important of the early Assyrian records
that have come down to us. The genealogical
details given in it are of great value for determining
the chronology and succession of the earlier monarchs
of Assyria, while the description of the campaigns of
the king throws a brilliant and unexpected light on
the ancient geography of Western Asia. To the
geographer, indeed, the care with which Tiglath
Pileser enumerates the countries he overran and the
cities he sacked is of inestimable importance. A
new chapter has been added to the history of ancient
geography, and we now possess a fairly complete
map of the districts north and north-west of Assyria
before the overthrow of the Hittite power had brought
with it revolution and change. We find geographical
names of similar form stretching westwards from the
neighbourhood of Lake Van to the confines of Asia
Minor, together with evidence that tribes like those



mscxTFmm"mi • 'in?EA th-pileser i 87
of the Moskhi and Tibareni, whose scanty relics
in later days found a refuge on the shores of the
Black Sea, once inhabited extensive tracts on the
slopes of the Taurus Mountains. A new world has,
in fact, been opened up to the geographer.
Equally new is the world that has been opened
up to the historian. The date of Tiglath-Pileser I
can be approximately fixed by the help of an inscrip
tion of Sennacherib. On the rock of Bavian (W. A. I.
iii. 14, 48-50) Sennacherib refers to " Rimmon and
Sala, the gods of the City of Palaces {Ekallati),
which Merodach-nadin-akhi, King of Accad, had
taken and carried away to Babylon in the time of
Tiglath-Pileser, King of Assyria"; and he goes on
to say that he himself had " brought them out of
Babylon 418 years afterwards." As the restora
tion of the images took place after Sennacherib's
destruction of Babylon in B.C. 688, the date of their
capture by Merodach-nadin-akhi would be B.C. 1 1 06.
The conquests and campaigns described in Tiglath
Pileser's inscription must therefore be placed before
this year.
The expeditions of Tiglath-Pileser, however, bore
but little fruit. They were not much more than
raids, whose effects passed away after the death of
the king who conducted them. In a fragmentary
inscription of his son and successor, Assur-bil-kala,
mention is made of "the land of the west," or
Phoenicia, but it is doubtful whether any further
campaigns were carried on in this direction. Assyria



RECORDS OF THE PAST
fell into a state of decay ; its frontier cities passed
into other hands, and for nearly two hundred years
it is hidden altogether from sight. It was not until
the ninth century before our era that under the war
like Assur-natsir-pal and his son Shalmaneser II it
once more became a name of terror to Western Asia.
Tiglath-Pileser I remained the central figure of the
older empire, towering above his fellows on the
Assyrian throne. When the ancient line of princes
became extinct, and the crown was seized by the
usurper Pul, the new king knew of no better way in
which to legitimise his claim to sovereignty than by
assuming the time-honoured name of Tukulti-pal
Esar or Tiglath-Pileser, " the servant of (Uras) the
divine son of Esarra."
Though Tiglath-Pileser was not brought into
direct relations with Palestine, it is probable that his
wars, followed as they were by the temporary decay
of Assyria, had much to do with the rise of the em
pire of David. The wars of Tiglath-Pileser weakened
the power of the Hittites in the north, and allowed
the small states of Syria to make head against them.
For more than a century the latter had no powerful
neighbours to fear or court. Egypt had passed
under eclipse, and was divided between rival dynasties
of kings, while Assyria had equally ceased to be
formidable. When David and Joab built up the
empire of Israel, there was no strong enemy to
oppose and attack them. Hadadezer of Zobah
might go "to recover his border at the river"

Euphrates ; there was no Hittite or Assyrian monarch
to stand in his way.
The inscription of Tiglath-Pileser I is inscribed
on four large octagonal cylinders of clay, origin
ally buried under the foundations of the four corners
of the great temple of Kileh Sherghat, the ancient
city of Assur, and now in the British Museum ; and
it has been published in the Cuiuiform Inscriptions of
Western Asia, i. pi. ix.-xvi. In 1857 the inscription
was selected for testing the substantial correctness of
the method employed by the Assyriologists, and of
the results obtained by them. On the proposal of
the Royal Asiatic Society, four translations of it,
more or less complete, were made independently by
Sir Henry Rawlinson, Mr. Fox Talbot, Dr. Hincks,
and Dr. Oppert, and submitted under seal to the
secretary of the Society. When opened and com
pared, it was found that they exhibited a remarkable
resemblance to one another as regards both the
transliteration of proper names and the rendering of
individual passages. The resemblance, in fact, was
greater than could be accounted for, except on the
assumption that the method employed by the
decipherers was a sound one, and that they were
working on a solid basis. Since 1857 immense
advances have been made in our knowledge of
Assyrian. Characters whose values were then un
known, and words whose meaning was obscure,
are now familiar to the student ; and a historical
inscription like that of Tiglath-Pileser presents



90 RECORDS OF THE PAST
but few difficulties to the Assyriologist of to
day.
In 1880 the inscription was re-edited and trans
lated with notes and glossary by Dr. W. Lotz under
the auspices of his teacher, Prof Fr. Delitzsch. The
translation embodied all the stores of increased
knowledge which the incessant labour of twenty-three
years had accumulated, and it is only in a compara
tively few passages that it can be improved. The
English reader may now consider that he has before
him the actual words of the old Assyrian king, and can
use them for historical and geographical purposes
without fear or reservation. The foot-notes will be
found to contain all the geographical information at
present attainable relative to the localities mentioned
in the text.
A word or two must be added on the name of
the divinity to whom Tiglath-Pileser was dedicated
by his parents. This deity represented the Sun-god
primitively worshipped at Nipur (now Niffer) in
Babylonia, who afterwards came to be regarded as a
sort of Chaldean Herakles. He is the only deity
of the first rank whose name is still a matter of
dispute. It is generally given as Adar in default of
anything better, but the reading is certainly false.
According to the monuments he was called Uras in
Accadian, and also in Semitic, when regarded as
" the god of light." But he was further known in
Assyrian as Baru " the revealer," though we learn
from a Babylonian text recently discovered in Upper

Egypt that his more usual title was Masu, "the
hero," a word which is, letter for letter, the same
as the Hebrew Mosheh, " Moses." Masu is defined
as being " the Sun-god who rises from the divine day."
As such he was identified with one of the primeval
gods of Accadian cosmology, and so became " the
son of E-sarra," or " the house of the firmament."

^ Sarpina was the name of one of the Hittite cities, whose god was invoked in the treaty between Ramses 11 and the Hittite king. With the termination we may compare that of Abar-'siuni in iv. 82. ^ The first part of the name Sadi-anteru, which reminds us of the Lydian Sady-attfis, may contain the name of the god Sanda or Sandon.
A Hittite prince mentioned by the Vannic king Menuas was called Sadahadas. Khattu-khi means "the Hittite," the suffix -X7«', as in Vannic, denoting a patronymic or gentilic adjective. Urra-khi-nas is similarly
derived from Urra, the termination -khi-nas, in Vannic, denoting " the place of the people of."

^ Subari, called Subarti a few lines farther on, had been overrun by Rimmon-nirari I. (B.C. 1330), and was afterwards conquered by Assurnatsir-pal, who describes it as situated between Qurkhi and Nirib, or the plain of Diarbeliir. As Qurkhi lay "opposite the land of the Hittites," Subari would have adjoined the territory of the latter people, in the immediate vicinity of Alzi and Purukuzzi. 2 This seems to be the same word as the Kolkhians of classical geography, though the seat of the Kolkhians was far to the north of that of the Kaska. In the classical period, however, we find that the Moschi and Tibareni (Meshech and Tubal) had also shifted far to the north of their habitat in Assyrian times, and like the Kolkhians had settled on
the shores of the Black Sea. A town of Kolkhis, now represented by the
name of Lake Goldshik, lay to the S. W. of Palu.
3 Uruma may be the Urima of classical geography, the modem Urum. It is called Urume of Bitanu by Assur-natsir-pal, Bitanu being the district south of Lake Van.

' It is clear that Kharia was a district of Qurkhi which lay eastward of Diarbekir and the Supnat or Sebeneh Su, in the direction of Bitlis. It is perhaps the Arua of Assur-natsir-pal which adjoined the western frontier of Ararat, a kingdom at that time confined to Lake Van and the district south of the Lake. The name reminds us of the classical Korra, now Karia, a little to the south-east of Kolkhis (on Lake Goldshik), and to the north-west of Diarbekir. ^ Birti, from baru "to see.'' ^ Perhaps to be read Azues.

THE ASSYRIAN STORY OF THE CREATION
Translated by the Editor
Fragments of a long epic poem, describing the
creation of the world in a series of tablets or books,
were discovered by Mr. George Smith among the
cuneiform treasures of the British Museum which
had come from the royal library of Kouyunjik or
Nineveh. The tablets appear to be seven in num
ber, and since the creation was described as consist
ing of a series of successive acts, it presented a
curious similarity to the account of the creation
recorded in the first chapter of Genesis.
The epic embodied certain of the ideas and be
liefs current in Assyria and Babylonia regarding the
creation of the universe. That there were other
ideas and legends is evident from the existence of
another story of the creation, which came originally
from the library of Cutha, and differed entirely from
that of the epic. The epic, as I have pointed out
in my Lectures on the Religion of the Ancient Baby
lonians (p. 385), clearly belongs to a late date. The
gods of the popular religion not only have their



THE ASSYRIAN STORY OF THE CREATION 123
places in the universe fixed, but even the period and
manner of their origin is described. The element
ary spirits of the old Accadian faith have passed
into the great gods of Semitic belief, and been finally
resolved into mere symbolical representatives of the
primordial elements of the world. Under a thin
disguise of theological nomenclature, the Babylonian
theory of the universe has become a philosophic
materialism. The gods themselves come and go
like mortal men ; they are the ofTspring of the ever
lasting elements of the heaven and earth, and of
that watery abyss out of which mythology had
created a demon of evil, but which the philosopher
knew to be the mother and source of all things.
The Tiamat of the first tablet of the epic is a very
different being from the Tiamat of the fourth.
I much doubt, therefore, whether the epic in its
present form is older than the time of Assur-bani
pal. It sums up under a poetical garb the teachings
of mythology and philosophy about the origin of
things. The Babylonians had always believed that
the world had been created out of water, and that
the present creation had been preceded by an earlier
creation, an imperfect and chaotic prototype of that
which followed. This earlier creation, in fact, had
been the work of chaos, and the destruction of it by
the younger gods of light and order ushered in the
new creation of the visible world. Light and dark
ness, chaos and order, are ever struggling one against
the other ; but the victory of light and order was



124 RECORDS OF THE PAST
assured ever since Merodach, the Sun-god, overthrew
the dragon Tiamat, " the wicked serpent " as she is
also called, who represented chaos and anarchy.
Tiamat is the Assyrian equivalent of the Hebrew
tehom, "the deep," upon whose face, according to
Gen. i. 2, darkness had rested before the universe
was made.
The cosmological system of the first tablet found
its way into the pages of a Greek writer, Damaskios,
who lived in the sixth century of our era (De Prim.
Princip. 125, p. 384, ed. Kopp). "The Babylon
ians," he tells us, " like the rest of the barbarians,
pass over in silence the one principle of the universe,
and they constitute two, Tavthe and Apas6n, mak
ing Apas6n the husband of Tavth^, and denominat
ing her ' the mother of the gods.' And from these
proceeds an only-begotten son Mumis, which, I con
ceive, is no other than the intelligible world pro
ceeding from the two principles. From them also
another progeny is derived, Lakhe and Lakhos ; and
again a third, Kissarfe and Ass6ros, from which last
three others proceed, Anos and Illinos and Aos.
And of Aos and Davke is born a son called Belos,
who, they say, is the fabricator of the world."
Tavthfi is Tiamat or Tiavat, Apas6n is ap'sn,
" the abyss," and Mumis is Mummu, who, however,
is identified with Tiamat in the epic, Kissare and
Ass6ros being Ki-sar and An-sar, " the lower " and
" the upper firmament." Lakh^ and Lakhos, that is to say, Lakhmu or Lakhvu and Lakhamu or La



THE ASSYRIAN STORY OF THE CREATION 125
khavu, must be read instead of the Dakhe and Dakhos
of the manuscripts. Belos is Bel-Merodach, "the
younger Bel," in contradistinction to " the older
Bel " of the city of Nipur, one of whose Accadian
names was Illil, the lUinos of Damaskios. It is
probable that the name of Lakhamu was carried to
Canaan along with those of other Babylonian gods such as Rimmon, Nebo, and Sin. At all events
Lakhmi seems to be the name of a Philistine in
I Chron. xx. 5, and Beth-lehem is best explained as
"the house of Lekhem," like Beth-Dagon, "the house of Dagon," or Beth-Anoth, "the house of
Anat."
Only the commencement of the first tablet (num
bered K 54 1 9) has been recovered, but the tablet
was of no great length, as the larger part of the
reverse appears to have been occupied by the colo
phon. It has been published by Mr. George Smith
in the Transactions of the Society of Biblical A rchce
ology, iv. 2 (1876), and by Professor Fr. Delitzsch
in his Assyrische Lesestiicke (ist edition, 1878), and
has been translated by Mr. Smith in his Chaldean
Genesis. Translations of it by Dr. Oppert, Dr.
Schrader, and myself have subsequently appeared.
A small fragment of the second tablet has been
found by Professor Delitzsch, containing the colo
phon, " the second tablet (of the series beginning)
' when above.' " The third tablet was partly repre
sented by the fragments numbered K 3473, Rm.
615. Lines 17-42 of the obverse have been



126 RECORDS OF THE PAST
published by Professor Delitzsch in his Assyrisches
Worterbiich, i. p. lOO, and portions of the text are
translated in Smith's Chaldean Genesis. A fragment
of the fourth tablet from the Library of Kouyunjik,
numbered K 3437, has been published by George
Smith (Trans. Soc. Bib. Arch., \y. 2), and Delitzsch
{Ass. Leses., pp. 82, 83), and translated by Smith,
Oppert, Lenormant, and others ; but nearly the whole
of the text has now been recovered from a tablet
brought from Babylonia by Mr. Rassam (numbered
82-9-18, 3737), and published by Mr. Budge in the
Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Arcliceology for
6th December 1887. A translation of it has been
given by myself in my Lectures on the Religion of
the Ancient Babylonians, pp. 379 seq. (1887)1 which I
can now improve in several particulars. The fifth
tablet (K 3567) was published by Smith {Trans. Soc.
Bib. Arch., iv. 2), and Delitzsch {Ass. Lescs., p. 78),
and translated by Smith, Oppert, and Lenormant.
About one-third of it is lost. Of the seventh (.?)
tablet only three small fragments remain (34S, 248,
147), published by Delitzsch {Ass. Leses., p. 79),
and translated by Smith in his Chaldean Geitesis.
To the third tablet probably belongs an unpublished
fragment (K 3449), describing the preparation of
the bow of Merodach ; an attempt at its translation
will be found in Smith's Chaldean Genesis.
No fragments of the sixth tablet have as yet been
noticed. According to Professor Delitzsch the frag
ment belonging to the second tablet concludes with



THE ASSYRIAN STORY OF THE CREATION 127
the prayer of Merodach to capture Tiamat and
avenge the gods, after Anu and Ea had already
declined to undertake the \.z.^{Assyrisches Worterbuch,
i. p. 65). The first line of the next tablet is stated
to be, " An-sar (the upper firmament) opened his
mouth." From this point onwards the ends of the
lines are preserved on the fragment numbered K
3473, and from line 9 onwards the beginnings of
the lines on fragment K 3938. They run as
follows :

1. "An-sar opened his mouth, and 2. unto him (Merodach) he speaks the word : 3. (' O lord, I) am yearning ^ in my liver ; 4. (against Tiamat) let me send thee, even thee
:
5. (with the snare?) thou shall ensnare (Tiamat), thou shalt be exalted (?) 6 thy ... to thy presence. 7 their divine porter. 8 let them dwell in feasting.' 9. The god went (saying), let them make the wine. 10. Humbly the god has . . . them; let them hear the report. 1 1. He has established and has fixed their . . ., (saying) thus : 12. 'Do thou .... thy (word) repeat to them. 13. An-sar, moreover, . . . has urged me on; 1 4. the law of (his) heart has made me, even me, to ponder 15. thus: 'Tiamat . . . has seen us; 1 6. she has convened {sitkimat) an assembly, and is violently enraged.'
"
Here follows the passage translated further on.
The last two lines of the tablet, as we learn from a
^ Khummulu, from khamalu, " to be pitiful."



128 RECORDS OF THE PAST
small fragment, concluded with the words, " (Mero
dach) ascended (from) their midst (and the great
gods) determined (for him his) destiny."
It will be seen that a good deal of the poem
consists of the words put into the mouth of the god
Merodach, derived possibly from older lays. The
first tablet or book, however, expresses the cosmo
logical doctrines of the author's own day. It opens
before the beginning of time, the expression " at that
time" answering to the expression "in the beginning"
of Genesis. The heavens and earth had not yet
been created, and since the name was supposed to
be the same as the thing named, their names had
not as yet been pronounced. A watery chaos alone
existed, Mummu Tiamat, " the chaos of the deep."
Out of the bosom of this chaos proceeded the gods
as well as the created world. First came the prim
aeval divinities Lakhmu and Lakhamu, words of
unknown meaning, and then An-sar and Ki-sar, " the
upper" and " lower firmament." Last of all were
born the three supreme gods of the Babylonian faith,
Anu the sky-god, Bel or Illil the lord of the ghost
world, and Ea the god of the river and sea.
But before the younger gods could find a suitable
habitation for themselves and their creation it was
necessary to destroy " the dragon" of chaos with all
her monstrous offspring. The task was undertaken
by the Babylonian sun-god Merodach, the son of Ea,
An-sar promising him victory, and the other gods
providing for him his arms. The second tablet was



THE ASSYRIAN STORY OF THE CREATION 129
occupied with an account of the preparations made
to ensure the victory of light over darkness and
order over anarchy.
The third tablet described the success of the god
of light over the allies of Tiamat. Light was intro
duced into the world, and it only remained to
destroy Tiamat herself The combat is described
in the fourth tablet, which takes the form of a poem
in honour of Merodach, and is probably an earlier
poem incorporated into his text by the author of the
epic. Tiamat was slain and her allies put in bond
age, while the books of destiny which had hitherto
been possessed by the older race of gods were now
transferred to the younger deities of the new world.
The visible heaven was formed out of the skin' of
Tiamat, and became the outward symbol of An-sar
and the habitation of Anu, Bel, and Ea, while the
chaotic waters of the dragon became the law-bound
sea ruled over by Ea.
The heavens having been thus made, the fifth
tablet tells us how they were furnished with mansions
for the sun and moon and stars, and how the
heavenly bodies were bound down by fixed laws
that they might regulate the calendar and determine
the year. The sixth tablet probably described the
creation of the earth, as well as of vegetables, birds,
and fish. In the seventh tablet the creation of
animals and reptiles was narrated, and doubtless also
that of mankind.
It will be seen from this that in its main outlines
VOL I. K



130 RECORDS OF THE PAST
the Assyrian epic of the creation bears a striking
resemblance to the account of it given in the first
chapter of Genesis. In each case the history of the
creation is divided into seven successive acts ; in
each case the present world has been preceded by a
watery chaos. In fact the self-same word is used of
this chaos in both the Biblical and Assyrian accounts

tekdm, Tiamat—the only difference being that in
the Assyrian story " the deep " has become a mytho
logical personage, the mother of a chaotic brood.
The order of the creation, moreover, agrees in the
two accounts ; first the light, then the creation of
the firmament of heaven, subsequently the appoint
ment of the celestial bodies " for signs and for
seasons and for days and years," and next, the
creation of beasts and "creeping things." But the
two accounts also differ in some important par
ticulars. In the Assyrian epic the earth seems not
to have been made until after the appointment of
the heavenly bodies, instead of before it as in
Genesis, and the seventh day is a day of work
instead of rest, while there is nothing corresponding
to the statement of Genesis that " the Spirit of God
moved upon the face of the waters." But the most
important differencfe consists in the interpolation of
the struggle between Merodach and the powers of
evil, as a consequence of which light was introduced
into the universe and the firmament of the heavens
was formed.
It has long since been noted that the conception



THE ASSYRIAN STORY OF THE CREATION 131
of this struggle stands in curious parallelism to the
verses of the Apocalypse (Rev. [xii. 7-9) : " And
there was war in heaven : Michael and his angels
fought against the dragon ; and the dragon fought
and his angels, and prevailed not ; neither was their
place found any more in heaven. And the great
dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the
Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world."
We are also reminded of the words of Isaiah xxiv.
21, 22 : "The Lord shall visit the host of the high
ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth
upon the earth. And they shall be gathered to
gether, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and
shall be shut up in prison." It may be added that
an Assyrian bas-relief now in the British Museum
represents Tiamat with horns and claws, tail and
wings.
There is no need of drawing attention to the pro
found difference of spiritual conception that exists
between the Assyrian epic and the first chapter of
Genesis. The one is mythological and polytheistic,
with an introduction savouring of the later material
ism of the schools ; the other is sternly monotheistic. Between Bel-Merodach and the Hebrew God there
is an impassable gulf
It is unfortunate that the last lines of the epic in
which the creation of man would have been recorded
have not yet been recovered. A passage in one of
the early magical texts of Babylonia, however, goes
to show that the Babylonians believed that the



132 RECORDS OF THE PAST
woman was produced from the man, conformably
to the statement in Gen. ii. 22, 23. We there read
of the seven evil spirits (W. A. I., iv. I. i. 36, 37)
that " the woman from the man do they bring
forth."

animals within her (in the abyss). AH this was an allegorical description of nature. For, the whole universe consisting of moisture, and animals being continually generated therein, the deity above mentioned (Bglos) cut off his own head ; upon which the other gods mixed the blood, as it
gushed out, with the earth, and from thence men were formed. On this account it is that they are rational and partake of divine knowledge." Similarly, according to Philon Byblios, Phcenician cosmology declared that the blood of Uranos or Baal-samaim, when mutilated by his son Kronos near the rivers and fountains, flowed into them and fertilised the earth.

THE BABYLONIAN STORY OF THE CREATION ACCORDING TO THE TRADITION OF CUTHA
Translated by the Editor
Besides the story of the Creation in a series of
successive acts, Mr. George Smith brought to Hght
the fragments of two tablets containing another
legend of the Creation which varied very consider
ably from it. The tablets belonged to the library of
Assur-bani-pal at Nineveh, but the colophon informs
us that they had been copied from older documents
which came from the library of Cutha, now Tel
Ibrahim, in Babylonia. The text has never been
published, but a translation was given of it by Mr.
Smith in his CJialdean Genesis, and a revised version
by myself in the Records of the Past, vol. xi. As
much progress has been made in cuneiform studies
during the ten years which have elapsed since the
latter was published, I now give another translation
of the inscription, embodying the improvements
which our increased knowledge of the Assyrian
language has enabled me to make.
The Cuthaean legend, it will be observed, knows



148 RECORDS OF THE PAST
nothing of a creation in successive acts. Chaos is a
period when as yet writing was unknown. But the
earth already existed, and was inhabited by the
chaotic brood of Tiamat, imperfect first attempts, as
it were, of nature, who lived in a city underground.
They were destroyed, not by Merodach, the god of
Babylon, but by Nergal, the patron-deity of Cutha,
who is identified with Nerra, the god of pestilence,
and Ner, the mythical monarch of Babylonia who
reigned before the Deluge. The words of the poem
are put into the mouth of Nergal, and the poem itself
was written for his great temple at Cutha.
The legend of Cutha agrees better with that
reported by Berdssos than does the legend of the
Epic. In both alike we have a first creation of
living beings, and these beings are of a composite
nature, the offspring of Tiamat or Chaos.' In both
alike the whole brood is exterminated by the gods
of light.
The date to which the legend in its present form
may be assigned is difificult to determine. The in
scription is written in Semitic only, like the other
creation-tablets, and consequently cannot belong to
the pre-Semitic age. It belongs, moreover, to an
epoch when the unification of the deities of Baby
lonia had already taken place, and the circle of the
great gods was complete. Ea, Istar, Zamama,
Anunit, even Nebo and Samas, are all referred to in
it. Possibly it may be dated in the age of Kham
muragas (cir. B.C. 2350).

BABYLONIAN LAWSUITS AND JUDGMENTS
Translated by Dr. Oppert
Having worked for more than five-and-twenty years
at the Babylonian and Assyrian deeds of contract and
legal decisions, and having explained the documents
relating to these subjects which have been discovered
in Mesopotamia, I am now able to state that the
meaning of these difficult texts is at length fairly
well understood by us. The simplest explanation is
that which is the most difficult to obtain, and I have
no doubt that the translations and interpretations I
offer will appear to many scholars so easy and con
clusive as to make them assume that any one might
have discovered them at the outset. Fortunately,
however, not only the translations of other scholars,
but my own imperfect ones as well, have been pub
lished, and will thus convince younger students of the
immense difficulty there is in arriving at results which
seem so evident.
The first texts which I have selected contain cer
tain contracts and legal decisions relating indubitably
to captive Jews who had been carried to Babylon after



BAB YLONIAN LA WSUITS AND JUDGMENTS 155
the destruction of Jerusalem. One of the most inter
esting of them is a lawsuit commenced by a Jewish
slave named Barachiel in order to recover his original
status. A copy of the text has been published by
Father Strassmaier in the Transactions of the Oriental Congress at Leyden, No. 42.
My translation of it, which will appear in the
Transactions of the Oriental Congress at Vienna, has
been amended in one or two points. The translations
offered by Dr. V. Revillout and a young Assyriologist,
Dr. Peiser, are very imperfect, Dr. Revillout having
entirely misunderstood the nature of the suit referred
to, and having fallen into several grammatical errors,
while Dr. Peiser's rendering is not less unacceptable.
The case was as follows :^Barachiel, who bears
the same name as the father of Elihu in the Book of
Job (xxxii. 2, 6), had been the property of a wealthy
person named Akhi-nuri, who had sold him to a widow
of the name of Gaga, about 570 B.C. He remained in
the house of this lady as a slave, with the power of
liberating himself by paying a sum equal to his pecu
litim, or private property which he had been allowed
to acquire, like a slave in ancient Rome ; but it seems
that he was never fortunate enough to be able to afford the sum of money required. He remained with Gaga
twenty-one years, and was considered the res or pro
perty of the house, and as such was handed over in
pledge, was restored, and finally became the dowry of
Nubta (" Bee "), the daughter of GagS. Nubta gave
him to her son and husband in exchange for a house



156 RECORDS OF THE PAST
and some slaves. After the death of the two ladies
he was sold to the wealthy publican Itti-Marduk
baladh, from whose house he escaped twice. Taken
the second time, he instituted an action in order that
he might be recognised as a ,free-born citizen, of the
family of Bel-rimanni ; and to prove that he was of
noble origin he pretended that he had performed the
matrimonial solemnities at the marriage of his master's daughter Qudasu with a certain Samas-mudammiq.^
Such a performance, doubtless, implied that the officiat
ing priest was of free birth, and that no slave or freed
man was qualified to take part in it. He declared, " I
am a mar-bant" or "descendant o( a. battA," literally a
"generator," or "ancestor," one of those semi-mythical
heroes who gave their names to the noble families of
Babylon.^ " I belong,'' he went on to say, " to the
family of Bel-rimanni," who in other texts is called a
high-priest. The case was brought before a court of
justice, and the royal judges asked Barachiel to prove
that he was of free birth. This actio prajudicialis de
ingenuitate was urged for and against, and eventually
Barachiel was obliged to retract his former statements.
He was unable to rebut the evidence alleged against
him, and though it is probable that the two married
persons whose "hands he had joined" were dead,
other witnesses came forward who proved that he
' The father of Akhi-nuri was Nabu - nadm - akh ("Nebo gives a brother "), and the father of the son-in-law bears the same name. But it is by no means certain that the uncle married his niece, since the two persons may have been different. * It would be a useful work to collect the names of all the hanA or ancestors, men of noble birth, like Egibi, Nur-Sin, and others.



BABYLONIAN LA WSUITS AND JUDGMENTS 157
was a slave with the power of purchasing his freedom.
The exact date at which the judgment was delivered
is not quite certain, but it must be later than the
seventh year of Nabonidus, when the father IttiMarduk-baladh was still alive.
I will now proceed to make some further remarks
on the details of the case, as it is very interesting, and
offers some useful hints as to the legal procedure of
the Babylonians.
The name of Bariki-ili or Barachiel is evidently
that of a Jew. He is called " a slave of ransom," that
is to say, not a slave who has already purchased his
freedom, since in that case he would have been free,
but a slave who was allowed by special laws to employ
his private fortune in the work of liberating himself
He professes-to have been the avil taslisu or "joiner"
of the hands of bride and bridegroom at a wedding
which must have taken place before the thirty-fifth
year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign, when he still belonged
to the house of Akhi-nuri, " the seller of the slave," as
he is called at the end of the text.
After the declaration of the slave, the document is
comparatively easy to understand. The judges, after
perusing all the evidence, do not find any proofs that
Barachiel was a man of free birth, and accordingly say
to him : " Prove to us that you are the descendant of
a (noble) ancestor." Thereupon Barachiel confesses
that he is not free-born, but has twice run away from
the house of his master ; as, however, the act was seen



IS8 RECORDS OF THE PAST
by many people he was afraid, and said, " I am the
son of a (noble) ancestor." " But I am not free-born,"
he continues, and then gives an account of the events
of his life.
The words mar-hatmt in line i6 signify " condition
of being a free-born citizen," and not " letter of client
ship," as Dr. Peiser supposes. The expression " letter
of citizenship '' {dippi mar-bantii) occurs several times,
and signifies the warrant given by a master to his
emancipated slave. " Non-citizenship " was the fourth
fact guaranteed by the seller of a slave to the pur
chaser, the other three being : (i) that the slave
should not rebel or run away ; if he returned to his
former master he was to be sent back ; (2) that no
claim should lie against the validity of the sale on
account of technical or other errors ; and (3) that the
purchaser should be secured against any claim made
upon the services of a slave by a royal officer.
Barachiel adds that after the death of the two
ladies Gag& and Nubta, he was sold for money to
Itti-Marduk-baladh, of the Egibi family, thus becom
ing a servus redimendus argento, a slave who could be
ransomed with money, and that he awaits the sentence
of the court.
The judges decided that Barachiel should be
restored to his original status, and added that it was
in the uzuz (or usuz) of the two married persons Samas-mudammiq and Qudasu that the judgment
was pronounced. This may signify "absence," the
two having died during the interval of more than



BAB YLONIAN LA WSUITS AND JUDGMENTS 159
twenty years which had elapsed since the marriage.
It is probable that Barachiel had invented the story of
his taking part in the wedding because he thought
that its falsity could not be detected. If, however, the
word is equivalent to the expression ina du-zu, the
texts from Sippara would go to show that it must
mean "in the presence of"
It may be remarked that not a word is said about
" a deed of slavery," which was certainly not given to
a slave in order to prove his own servile condition as
a vindex libertatis, as Dr. Revillout seems to imagine.
The only penalty imposed upon the slave is his
restoration to his ancient condition ; penalties were
decreed against those who wished to annul a contract,
not against those who pretended to be free citizens.
In this respect the Babylonian law was more humane
than the Roman. This is the more surprising, since
it cannot be denied that severe penalties were at times
inflicted. The Micheaux-stones, for example, in
scribed in the twelfth century before our era, threaten
the transgressors of a contract and those who annul
their covenants with the curses of the gods, each of
whom would inflict a special punishment. The old
Jew escaped with the failure of his attempt to recover
his undeserved loss of liberty ; perhaps the court took
into serious consideration his fidelity to his former
master, who had esteemed him to be worth not only a
house but other slaves as well.

INSCRIPTION OF MENUAS, KING OF ARARAT, IN THE VANNIC LANGUAGE
Translated by the Editor
Since the publication of my Memoir on " The Cunei
form Inscriptions of Van Deciphered and Translated "
in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, xiv. 4,
1882, we have begun to learn something about a
race of kings who ruled on the shores of Lake Van
in Armenia, from the ninth to the seventh centuries
before our era. The founder of the dynasty, Sar
duris I, the son of Lutipris, who reigned in B.C. 833,
introduced the cuneiform system of writing as well
as other elements of Assyrian culture into the country
over which he was king. The inscriptions he has
left us are in the Assyrian language ; but his suc
cessors discontinued the use of a foreign tongue, and
the language of their texts is invariably their native
one. It is semi-flectional in character, and possibly
belongs to the same family of speech as that of
which Georgian is the modern representative. For
want of a better name it is known as Vannic. The
story of its decipherment will be found in the Memoir
above cited.



1 64 RECOUDS OF THE PAST
The grandson of Sarduris I was Menuas, a prince
who carried his arms far and wide, and has bequeathed
to us numerous records of his wars and buildings.
Far away from his capital of Dhuspas or Tosp, near
the mountain of Rowandiz and the Lake of Urumiyeh,
on the summit of the pass of Keli-shin, 12,000 feet
above the level of the sea, is a monument of his cam
paigns, which is wrapt during the greater part of the
year in a coating of ice ; in the north he engraved
his inscriptions beside the banks of the Araxes, while
the record of his campaign against "the land of the
Hittites " is inscribed on the cliff of the Euphrates
at Palu, about midway between Malatiyeh and Van.
The inscription translated here was copied by
Schulz and Sir A. H. Layard from a stone built into
the wall of a vault under the church of Sts. Peter and
Paul at Van, and a squeeze of it has been taken
by Captain Clayton. The transliterated text and
analysis will be found in my Memoir, xxxii. p. 555.
The text is mutilated in parts, and at the time my
Memoir was published I was unable to restore some
of the passages in it. The progress that has since
been made, however, in the study of the Vannic in
scriptions, enables me now to supply their deficiencies,
and also to correct and supplement the translation I
then gave. For the sake of Vannic scholars I append
here a transliterated text of the inscription as it
should read after the restoration of the missing
characters :

We learn from the inscription that the land of the
Khate or Hittites extended as far north as Alzi, the
situation of which is given in the inscription of
Tiglath-Pileser I (i. 64 ; see above,, p. 94, note 4), and that Sada-hadas, whose name was perhaps pro
nounced Sanda-hadas, was the king of that portion
of the Hittite nation with which Menuas was brought
into contact. The mention of the name of the Khate
or Hittites on this and other Vannic monuments
shows that the name was not confined to the Hittites
of the south.

1 The supreme god of Van was Khaldis, but as each tribe or district also worshipped a god of the same name, there were many Khaldis-gods who are invoiced by the Vannic kings along with the supreme Khaldis of Van. It was from the worship of Khaldis that the population of a part of Armenia became known to the Greeks as Khaldsei, a name naturally confounded with that of the Chaldeans of Babylonia. 2 The Vannic kings usually call themselves kings of Biainas or Bianas, a name which has passed through the Byana of Ptolemy into the modem Van. Van is now, however, the name of the city which the Vannic kings called Dhuspas or Tosp, instead of denoting a district as it did in their time, Tosp being now the name of the district. Biainas was known to the Assyrians under the name of Urardhu, the Ararat of the Old Testament. Mount Ararat, it may be noted, is a modern designation, the name of Ararat not being applied to the country north of the Araxes in the Biblical age, and "the mountains of Ararat " of Genesis viii. 4 signifying, as in the Assyrian inscriptions, the Kurdish mountains to the south of Lake Van. ' The M^na of the Vannic texts are the Mann4 of the Assyrians, the Minni of the Old Testament, whose position is shown by the inscriptions to have been immediately to the west of the kingdom of Van, from which they were separated by the Kotfir range. * Khai-tA maybe connected with khai-di-a-ni, "fruits" (from khai,
" to grow "), but it may also be a compound of tu and kha, "to possess," like 'sui-du, " to set for a possession," or abili-du, " to set on fire." ° Tarkhi-gamas seems to be compounded with the name of the Hittite god Tarkhu, like Tarkhu-lara, king of the Gamguma, and Tarkhu-nazi, king of Malatiyeh, mentioned on the Assyrian monuments.

THE ANCIENT HEBREW INSCRIPTION OF SILOAM
Translated by the Editor
The oldest Hebrew inscription yet discovered is en
graved on the rocky wall of the subterranean channel
which conveys the water of the Virgin's Spring at
Jerusalem into the Pool of Siloam. The history of
its discovery is curious. In the summer of 1 880 one
of the native pupils of Dr. Schick, a German architect
long resident in Jerusalem, was playing with some
other lads in the Pool, and while wading up the sub
terranean channel slipped and fell into the water.
On rising to the surface, he noticed, in spite of the
darkness, what looked like letters on the rock which
formed the southern wall of the channel. Dr. Schick,
on being told of them, visited the spot, and found
that an ancient inscription, concealed for the most
part by the water, actually existed there.
The first thing to be done was to lower the level of
the water, so as to expose the inscription to view.
But his efforts to copy the text were not successful.
He was not a palaeographer ; and as the letters of the
inscription, as well as every crack and flaw in the stone.



ANCIENT HEBREW INSCRIPTION OF SILOAM 169
had been filled by the water with a deposit of lime, it
was impossible for him to distinguish between char
acters and accidental markings on the rock, or to
make out the exact forms of the letters. The first
intelligible copy was accordingly made by myself
during my visit to Jerusalem in February 1881. As,
however, I had to sit for hours in the mud and water,
working by the dim light of a candle, my copy required
correction in several points, and it was not until the
arrival of Dr. Guthe six weeks later that an exact
facsimile was obtained. Dr. Guthe removed the de
posit of lime by the application of an acid, and so
revealed the original appearance of the tablet. A cast
of it was taken, and squeezes made from the cast
which could be studied at leisure and in a good light.
The inscription is engraved on the lower part of an
artificial tablet cut in the wall of rock about 19 feet
from the place where the subterranean conduit opens
out upon the Pool of Siloam, and on the right hand
side of one who enters it. The conduit is at first
about 16 feet high ; but the height gradually lessens
until in one place it is not quite 2 feet above the
floor of the passage. According to Captain Conder's
measurements, the tunnel is 1708 yards in length from
the point where it leaves the Spring of the Virgin to
the point where it enters the Pool of Siloam. It does
not run, however, in a straight line, and towards the
centre there are two cub de sac, the origin of which is
explained by the inscription. We there learn that
the workmen began the conduit simultaneously at



I70 RECORDS OF THE PAST
both ends, like the engineers of the Mont C^nis tunnel,
intending to meet in the middle. But they did not
succeed in doing so, though the two excavations had
approached one another sufficiently near for the work
men in the one to hear the sound of the pickaxes used
by the workmen in the other. How such a feat of
engineering was possible in the age when the tunnel
was excavated it is difficult to understand, more
especially when we remember that the channel slopes
downward through the rock, and winds very consider
ably. It may be added that the floor of the conduit
has been rounded to allow the water to pass through
it more easily. The Pool of Siloam is of comparatively modern
construction, but it encloses the remains of a much
older reservoir. It is situated on the south-eastern
extremity of the hill, sometimes, but erroneously,
called Ophel, which lies to the south of the Temple
hill, now represented by the Mosque of Omar, but
separated from the latter by the remains of a valley,
which was first perceived by Dr. Guthe and Dr.
Schick. The Virgin's Spring is on the opposite side
of the hill, but more to the north, overlooking the
valley of the Kidron. As it is the only natural
spring, or " gihon," as the Jews would have called it,
in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, the command of
its supply of water was of primary importance to the
inhabitants of the Jewish capital. It was, however,
•outside the walls of the city, and hence the necessity
of cutting a conduit through the hill which should



ANCIENT HEBREW INSCRIPTION OF SILOAM 171
convey its water to a reservoir within the town. We
are told in 2 Chron. xxxii. 4 that when the
Assyrians invaded Judah Hezekiah " stopped all the
fountains," that is to say, he concealed them under
masonry or earth. The Virgin's Spring or Gihon
must have been similarly sealed up, while its water
was conducted into the city through a subterranean
channel.
The date of the inscription has occasioned a good
deal of controversy, some scholars assigning it to the
reign of Hezekiah, and others to an earlier period.
The chief reason for believing it to have been a
work of Hezekiah is that in 2 Kings xx. 20 it is
stated that " he made a pool and a conduit, and
brought water into the city," while in 2 Chron.
xxxii. 30 we read that he "stopped the upper
watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down
to the west side of the city of David." But a more
literal rendering of the latter passage would be, " he
stopped the exit (mStsa) of the waters of the Upper
Gihon, and he directed them downwards on the west
side of the city of David." Here it is evident that
by the Upper Gihon is meant the Spring of the
Virgin, for which the word motsd or " exit" is em
ployed in the inscription. Besides the Upper Gihon
there must have been another or Lower Gihon, which
can have been none other than the Pool of Siloam.
This had become a second source of water-supply,
and might therefore with propriety be named "a.
spring."



172 RECORDS OF THE PAST
It would consequently appear from the chronicler's
words that the Pool of Siloam already existed in the
time of Hezekiah, and that what the Jewish monarch
did was to excavate a second conduit, running from
the Pool, not in a winding direction like the tunnel
of Siloam, but in a straight direction along the
western side of the city of David. Now such a
conduit has actually been discovered cut in the rock
and leading from the Pool of Siloam to another
reservoir which once existed below.
There is, moreover, evidence in the Book of Isaiah
that the tunnel of Siloam was in existence before
Hezekiah came to the throne. In Isaiah viii. 6 a
prophecy is recorded, uttered while Ahaz was still
reigning, in which allusion is made to "the waters
of Shiloah that go softly." This can hardly refer
to anything else than the gently -flowing stream
which still runs through the tunnel of Siloam. The
inference is supported by the name Shiloah itself,
which probably signifies " the tunnel," and would
have been given to the locality in consequence of
the channel which was here excavated through the
rock.
The characters of the inscription exhibit to us
the alphabet which was used by the prophets before
the Exile. They belong to what may be termed
the southern or Jewish branch of the old Phoenician
alphabet, a parallel branch to which was used in
Moab, and is found on the Moabite Stone. The
forms of some of the letters are more archaic than



ANCIENT HEBREW INSCRIPTION OF SIIOAM 173
those on the Moabite Stone, the forms of others less
so. Similar forms are met with on early Israelitish
and Jewish seals, which go back to a period preced
ing the Captivity. They are characterised by a
peculiarity which shows not only that writing was
common, but also that the usual writing material
was papyrus or parchment, and not stone or metal.
The " tails" attached to certain letters are not straight
as on the Moabite Stone or in Phoenician inscriptions,
but rounded. The words, it may be added, do not
always end with the line.
The language of the inscription is the purest
Hebrew. It presents us with only one unknown word,
zadah in line 3, which seems to mean "excess" or "ob
stacle." Why it should have been engraved on the
lower part of a carefully-prepared tablet, where the
water of the conduit would necessarily conceal it, it
is impossible to conjecture. The upper part of the
tablet may perhaps have been intended to contain a
royal inscription giving the name of the king under
whom the work was executed.
One fact, however, is made very clear by the
text. Whether it were the Siloam tunnel itself, or
the second tunnel leading from it to a lower reservoir,
that was constructed by Hezekiah, in either case the
Pool of Siloam would lie " on the west side of the
city of David." " The city of David" must, accord
ingly, have stood on the southern hill, the so-called
Ophel ; and since the city of David was identical
with Zion, according to 2 Samuel v. 7, this hill must



174 RECORDS OF THE PAST
represent the original mount of Zion. Consequently
the valley of the Sons of Hinnom must be the valley
which was known in the time of Josephus as the
Tyropoeon or Cheesemakers'. It once divided both
the Temple hill and the southern hill from the
mountains on the west, though it is now choked
with the rubbish which the numerous destroyers of
Jerusalem have thrown into it. In some places the
rubbish is more than 70 feet deep, and under it, if
anywhere, we must look for the tombs of the kings
that were cut in the rocky cliff of the city of David.
Here, too, if anywhere, will be found the relics of the
temple and palace that Nebuchadnezzar destroyed,
overlaid with the accumulations of more than two thousand years.
A cast of the Siloam inscription may be seen in
the rooms of the Palestine Exploration Fund, and
facsimiles in Canon Isaac Taylor's History of the
Alphabet, i. p. 234, and in Fresh Light from the Monuments, p. i o i
.
1. (Behold the) excavation! Now this is the history of the excavation. While the excavators were still lifting up 2. the pick.i each towards his neighbour, and while there were yet three cubits to (excavate, there was heard) the voice of one man 3. calling to his neighbour, for there was an excess {?) in the rock on the right hand (and on the left ?). And after that on the day

We learn from the latter passage (Isaiah x.Kii. g, 11) that there were at least three "pools" or reservoirs in Jerusalem in the time of Hezekiah, and yet our inscription shows that there must have been a period when only one such reservoir existed, since it terms the Pool of Siloam '
' thi pool."
^ A flaw in the rock makes this word doubtful. It begins with m and ends with 't, and appears to consist of three letters.

PREFACE
The present volume of Records of the Past possesses
a melancholy interest. It contains the last literary
monument of one of the most valued of my fellow
workers, M. Arthur Amiaud, who died suddenly just
after completing the final pages of his translations of
the inscriptions of Tel-loh. No other Assyrian
scholar had so thoroughly mastered the secrets of the
non-Semitic language of ancient Chaldaea, and the
knowledge which has perished with him is for science
an irreparable loss. The hand that traced the
interpretation of the mysterious records of primeval
Shinar was not permitted to revise it in proof.
It will be seen that I have been able to redeem
my promise of editing the latest and most authorita
tive translations of the early Egyptian texts, and I
am fortunate in having secured the help of Professor
Maspero, the most eminent of living Egyptologists,
for the work. I hope next year to be able to redeem
my other promise of bringing out two volumes during
the same year.
I must take this opportunity of correcting a
misreading which I have allowed to appear in two



VI PREFACE
passages of the last volume of the Records. The
name of the Hittite prince mentioned by the Vannic
king Menuas is not Sada-hadas, as it is given on
pages 97 and 165, but Sada-halis, as it is correctly
transcribed in the transliteration and translation of
the inscription itself (pp. 165, 166).
In the translations doubtful words and expressions
are followed by a note of interrogation, the preceding
word being put into italics where necessary. The
names of individuals are distinguished from those of
deities or localities by being printed in Roman type,
whereas the names of deities and localities are in
capitals.

INSCRIPTION OF UNI (OF THE SIXTH DYNASTY)
Translated by Prof. Maspero
y. This inscription adorned one of the walls of the tomb which Uni had built for himself at Abydos in
the central part of the necropolis (Mariette : Abydos,
vol. ii. p. 41 ; Catalogue Ghieral, p. 84, No. 522).
It was discovered there by Mariette and transferred
to the Museum of Boulaq (Mariette : Notice des prin
cipanx Monuments, 1864, pp. 286-287), where it now
bears the number 886 (Maspero : Guide du Visiteur,
pp. 209-2 11). E. de Rouge copied it there in 1865
and made an analysis of it, intermingled with trans
lations, which he published in his Reclierches sur les
Monuments (pp. 1 17-128, 135-149, pi. vii., viii.)
His work served as a starting-point for the complete
translations of Birch (" Inscription of Una," in the
Records of tlte Past, prior series, ii. pp. 1-8), and the
partial translations of Maspero (Histoire ancienne des
Peuples de V Orient, 1875, pp. 88-92; 1886, pp. 81
85) and of Brugsch (Geschichte Aegyptens, pp. 95-102).

what incorrectly, by Marietta {Abydos, vol. ii. pp. 44
49) ; it has again been edited, with the corrections of
Brugsch and Golenischeff, by Erman {Commentar zur
Insclirift des Una in Lepsius's Zeitschrift, 1882, pp.
1-29), together with a translation and a grammatical
commentary, some points in which have been slightly
modified by Erman in his work on Egypt [Aegypten,
pp. 688-690, et passiiii). Brugsch has devoted one
of the most interesting of his memoirs to the study
of the names of the Nubian populations contained
in our inscription {Die Negerstdmme der Una-Insthrift
in the Zeitschrift, 1882, pp. 30-36).
The inscription consists of 5 2 lines, of which the
first alone is horizontal and runs along the summit
of the wall like a sort of general title. On the right
side it has suffered a little, and the lines at the be
ginning have lost almost all the characters at the top
and the bottom of them ; but only two or three of
these lacunce are impossible to fill up, and interrupt
the sense. Everywhere else, the expression is clear,
easy to comprehend, and the difficulties which it
offers to the interpreter result only from our present
ignorance of the exact signification of certain terms
peculiar to architecture, navigation, and the military
art at the remote epoch to which the inscription
belongs. The portions of the text which have been
restored are enclosed between brackets.
The stele which was found with this inscription
is in the Museum of Boulaq at Cairo, and has the
form of a false door : it is evidently the same which



INSCRIPTION OF UNI
was given to Uni by king Meriri Pepi, as stated
in the inscription. Mariette has given a de
scription of the stele in his Catalogue General des
Monuments d' Abydos (p. 90, No. 529 ; cfer. J. and
E. de Rouge : Inscriptions, vol. i. pi. II.). The tomb
of Auu, the father of Uni, has been discovered at
Abydos (E. de Rouge : Recherches stir les Momivients,
p. 144, note i). Uni died before Miriniri, who is
the last king mentioned in his biography ; if, as I
have conjectured, he was born in the reign of Unas,
his age could not have exceeded sixty years.

[An order was also issued] by the Majesty of my lord that a sarcophagus of white stone should be brought to me from Roiu.'^ His Majesty sent a templeslave in a boat with the soldiers [the hewers of the stone and the artisans] with orders to convey this sarcophagus to me from Roiu ; and this sarcophagus comes with a temple-slave in a large pontoon ^ from the royal administration, as well as its lid, a stele in the form of a gate, (to wit) the frame, the two middle blocks, and the threshold ; ^ never had anything like it been made for any other servant whatever ; but it happened that my wisdom pleased his Majesty and that also my zeal pleased his Majesty and that also the
heart of his Majesty was satisfied v/ith me. Also from my being Sabu, guardian of Nekhni, his Majesty made me sole Friend, superintendent of the irrigated lands of the Pharaoh * over the superintendents of the cultivated lands who are there, and I acted to the satisfaction of his Majesty, both when I had to keep guard behind the Pharaoh and (when I had) to settle the royal itinerary, or to arrange the peers, and I acted in all this to the satisfaction of his Majesty above everything. When moreover one went to the royal harem to inform against the great royal wife Amitsi, secretly, his Majesty made me alone descend into it in order to listen to business, no Sabu clerk of the Porte being there, nor any peer except myself alone, because of (my) wisdom

and my zeal which pleased his Majesty, because the heart of his Majesty was satisfied with me ; it was I who wrote everything down, I alone with a Sabu guardian of Nekhni.
Now my employment was that of superintendent of the irrigated lands of the Pharaoh, and there never had been any of this rank who had heard the secrets of the royal harem, in former days, excepting me, when his Majesty
made me hear (them), because my wisdom pleased his Majesty more than any other of his peers, more than any other of his mamelouks, more than any other of his servants.

There were generals in it, there were mamelouks of the king of Lower Egypt in it, there were sole Friends of the Pharaoh in it, there were in it dictators and princes of the south and of the land of the north,^ Golden Friends and superintendents of the prophets of the south and of the land of the north, prefects of the confines at the head of the militia of the south and of the land of the north, cities and boroughs

down the law for them—although my employment was that of superintendent of the irrigated lands of the Pharaoh
with the title belonging to my office ^— so that each of them
obeyed like all the rest,^ and each of them took with him what he needed as regards bread and sandals for the journey, and each of them took beer from every town, and each of them took every kind of small cattle from every individual.

mace, — a weapon which serves as a determinative of the verb soku, —and
whom their wound must have left half dead on the field of battle. They were called '
' the living-stricken "in opposition to those who had been killed by the mace.

praised me because of this above everything. His Majesty sent me to lead this army five times, in order to penetrate ^ into the country of the Hiru-shau, as often as they revolted against this army, and I acted to the satisfaction of his Majesty in this above everything. Then as it was said that there were rebels among those barbarians who'extended as far as towards Tiba,^ I sailed in ships with this army, I attacked the coasts of this country to the north of the country of the Hiru-shau ; then this army being on the march, I went and overthrew them all, and I slew all the rebels among them. When I was at the great House with the right of carrying the wand and the sandals, the Pharaoh Mirinri made me governor-general of the South, southward starting from Elephantine (and) northward as far as the Letopolitan nome, because my wisdom pleased his Majesty, because my zeal pleased his Majesty, because the heart of his Majesty was satisfied with me : when then I was invested with the right of carrying the wand and the sandals, his Majesty favoured me therefore (giving me part of) the cattle intended for the palace ; when I was in my place I was above all his peers, and all his mamelouks and all his servants, and this dignity had never been conferred on any servant whatever before. I filled to the satisfaction of the king my part of superintendent of the South, so as to be allowed to stand at his side second (in rank) to him, accomplishing all the duties of an engineer, judging all causes that there were to judge

Perhaps we may identify
it, as Krall does [Studien zitr Geschichte des AUen ALgyptens, iii. p. 22),
with the name of Tebui met with in a text at Edfu (Dumichen : Tcmpeliiischriften, i. pi. Ix.xiii. 1. 2, and Die Onsen dcr libyschen Wiiste, pi. xvi. e), which Bnigsch (Reise nach der Grossen Oase, p. 92) does not know where to loc-ilo. If the identification is correct, we can conclude that Tebui, associated as it is with Amit and the north-east of Egypt, was a canton situated beyond Lake Mcnzaleh ; the expedition of Uni would have been
made on the lake, not on the sea. Possibly there may also be a reference
to the arm of the sea which extended to the Bitter Laices.

His Majesty sent me to Abhait,! to bring back the sarcophagus (called) the Coffer of the Living, with its lid, as well as the true and precious pyramidion of the pyramid (called) " KhAnofir mistress of Mirinri." His Majesty sent me to Elephantine to bring a stele in the form of a false door, together with its base of granite, as well as the portcullis and the framework of granite [for the passage of the pyramid], (and) to bring back the gates and the thresholds of the exterior chapel of the pyramid " Khanofir mistress of Mirinrri." I returned with them to the pyramid Khanofir of Mirin-ri in six galliots,
three pontoons, three barges, (and) a man of war, —never

His Majesty sent me to Hatnueu ^ to transport a large table of offerings of alabaster. I brought this table of offerings down [from the mountain] : as it was impossible in HatNUBU to despatch (it) along the course of the current in this galliot, I cut a galliot out of the wood of the acaciasont, 60 cubits long and 30 cubits broad ; I embarked the 1 7th day of the third month of Shomu, and although there was no water over the sand-banks of the river I reached the pyramid Khanofir of Mirin-rt prosperously ; I was there with [the table of offerings] without fail according to the order which the majesty of my lord had deigned to command me.

The Berlin Papyrus No. i, purchased by Lepsius in
Egypt and published by him in the Denkmdler aiis
Aegypten imd Ethiopien, vi. pi. 104-107, is injured
at the beginning. In its present condition it contains
312 lines of text. The first 179 lines are vertical ;
then come 96 lines (180-276) which are horizontal ;
but from line 277 to the end the scribe has returned
to the system of vertical columns. The first 40
lines that are preserved have suffered more or less
from wear and tear; five of them (i, 13-15, 38)
present lacunae which I could never have succeeded
in filling up, had I not had the good fortune to
discover at Thebes a new manuscript. The end is
intact and concludes with the well-known formula :
" It is completed from its commencement to its
termination as has been found in the book." The
writing, very clear and bold in the vertical portions,
becomes clumsy and confused in the horizontal por
tions ; it is full of ligatures and rapidly-written forms
which at times render its decipherment difificult.

by the author in Lepsius's ZeitscJirift (1872, pp.
ro-24), and reproduced in the former series of
Records of the Past, vol. vi. pp. 1 3 1 - 1 5 o. Maspero
transcribed it in hieroglyphics and translated it in
French: Le Papyrus de Berlin No. i (1874-76), in

D. Haigh has examined the historical and geo
graphical data contained in the story in an article in
Lepsius's Zeitschrift, 1875, pp. 78-107, and Prof
Erman has inserted a short analysis of it in his
book : Aegyptcn imd aegyptisches Leben ini Altertum
(1885-88), pp. 494-497We possess on an ostrakon in the British Museum
(No. 5629) the duplicate of a part of the text. This
ostrakon, first mentioned by Dr. Birch in his memoir
on the Abbott Papyrus, has been published by him,
in facsimile, in his Inscriptions in tJic Hieratic and
Demotic character, from the Collections of the British
Museum (1868), pi. xxiii. p. 8.



THE ADVENTURES OF SINUHIT 13
The identity ot the text on the ostrakon with
that of the last hnes of the Berhn Papyrus was
pointed out for the first time by Goodwin : On
a Hieratic Inscription upon a stone in the British
Museum (Lepsius's Zeitschrift, 1872, pp. 20-24),
where the transcription and translation of the text
are given at full length. The script belongs to the
age of the twentieth dynasty, and this fact is
important, as it proves that the story, composed at
the latest in the epoch of the sixteenth or seventeenth
dynasty, remained a classic for long afterwards.
As the version given on the ostrakon differs in
certain details from that of the Papyrus, it will be
useful to insert here a complete translation of it :
" [I was allowed] to construct [a pyramid] of stone, in the circle of the pyramids. The stone-cutters cut the tomb, and divided its walls the architects designed them ; the superintendent of the sculptors sculptured them ; the superintendent of the works in the necropolis traversed the country (for) all the furniture with which I furnished this tomb. I allotted peasants to it, and there were lakes, fields (and) gardens in its domain, as in the case of Friends of the highest rank. [There was] a statue of gold with a silver-gilt hilt, which the sons of the king made for me, rejoicing to do so for me ; for I was in favour with the king until the day arrived when one attains the other bank. It is ended prosperously in peace."
The portion wanting at the commencement has
been found at Thebes on an ostrakon, picked up on
the 6th of February 1886 in the tomb of Sonnozmu.
It is a fragment of limestone, broken in half, more



14 RECORDS OF THE PAST
than three feet in length and about seven inches in
breadth, covered with hieratic characters of somewhat
large size, punctuated with red ink and divided into
paragraphs like most of the MSS. of the epoch of
the Ramessids. On the back, two lines, unfortunately
almost illegible, give us the name of a scribe which
I cannot decipher, probably the name of the person
who wrote the text. The fracture is not recent.
The limestone has been broken at the very moment
of its introduction into the tomb, and the act has
not been accomplished without injury to the inscrip
tion ; some splinters of the stone have disappeared
and have carried portions of words away with them.
Most of these lacunse can be filled up without
difficulty. The text is very incorrect, like that of
all works intended for the use of the dead. Many
of the variants presented by it result from faulty
readings of the original manuscript ; the scribe could
not read with accuracy the archaic style of writing.
The ostrakon has been published by Maspero : Les
premieres lignes des Mhiioires de Sinoukit, restitutes
d'apres I'Ostracon 27,^/p dii mush de Boulaq, with
two plates in facsimile in the M^moires de I'Institut
igyptien, ii. pp. 1-23.
The discovery of this new document allows us to
reconstruct the route followed by Sinuhit in his
flight. He left the camp on the Libyan frontier in
the land of the Timihu, thus starting from the west
and turning his back on the " Canton of the Sycomore." According to Brugsch [Dictionnaire



THE ADVENTURES OF SINUHIT 15
geographique, p. 53), Nuhit, "the Canton of the
Sycomore," is the Panaho of the Copts, the Athribis
of the Greeks, the modern Benha el-Assal. This
identification, however, falls of itself, since Nuhit is
mentioned at the very beginning of the journey, and
consequently must have been on the western bank
of the Nile, whereas Benha is on the eastern. I had
at first considered the " Canton of the Sycomore " as
a mode of designating the whole of Egypt. But we
have long been acquainted with a Nuhit or Pa-nib
nuhit, which appears to have been in the first instance
only a quarter of Memphis, and subsequently to have
denoted the whole of Memphis (Brugsch, Diction. G^og.,
pp. 330-332). The " Canton of the Sycomore" is
probably this " Quarter of the Sycomore," and
Sinuhit, the son of the Sycomore, the Memphite, in
declaring that he turns his back on Nuhit, simply
means to tell us that he departs from Memphis, his
native place, to go to Shi-Snofrui. The " Wady of
Snofrui " is not otherwise known. Brugsch, however,
identifies it with the Myekphorite nome of Herodotos
(iii. 166), thanks to a pronunciation Mui - hik
Snofru, borne according to him by the characters
which compose the name {Diction. G^og., p. 54). The
position occupied by this town in the itinerary leads
me to look for it between the Libyan desert,
Memphis, and the city of Khri-Ahu or the Egyptian
Babylon, about a day's journey from this latter and
perhaps in the vicinity of the pyramids of Gizeh and
Abu-Ro^sh. When the evening arrived, Sinuhit



i6 RECORDS OF THE PAST
approached Khri-Ahu, crossed the Nile, and resumed
his journey, passing eastward of the country of
lauku. This country was hitherto unknown ; it is,
I believe, the district of the stone-cutters, all the
region of quarries which extends from Tourah to the
desert along the Gebel Ahhmar or " Red Mountain."
Thence Sinuhit marched on foot as far as one of the
fortified posts which protected Egypt on this side,
between Abu-Zabel and Belbeis. Beyond this, he
mentions only Puteni and Qimoiri. Brugsch
identifies Puteni with a country of Pat which he has
met with on a monument of the Saitic period, and
of which the modern city of Belbeis would represent
the centre {Diction. G^og., pp. 54, 55). The great
Ptolemaic stele discovered by Mr. Naville at Tel
el-Maskhuta furnishes some data for determining
pretty exactly the position of Qimoiri. It contains
a name Qimoir, which Mr. Naville has identified,
with good reason, with the Qimoiri of the story of
Sinuhit {The Store-city of Pithom and the route of the
Exodus, pp. 21, 22). Ptolemy Philadelphus built
here the city which he called Arsinoe after his sister,
which became one of the emporia of Egyptian trade
with the Red Sea. Mr. Naville places Arsinoe, and
consequently Qimoiri, near the modern el-Maghf&r
in the heart of the ancient Gulf of Suez. This site
would suit our narrative admirably ; after having
quitted Puteni, Sinuhit would have plunged into the
desert, towards the north-east, and would have lost
himself in the sands in his endeavour to reach Qimoiri.



THE ADVENTURES OF SINUHIT 17
Beyond this point he entered the country of Edim^ or Eduma, in which Chabas has recognised
the land of Edom (^Les Papyrus de Berlin, pp. 39,
75, 76). The scribe states expressly that it was a
canton of the Upper Tonu. Tonu accordingly must
enclose at least the district between the Dead Sea
and the Sinaitic Peninsula. The prince of Tonu
gives the Egyptian hero a very rich district, Aaa,
or better Ala, the name of which denoted a species
of plant, and recalls that of Alan, ^an, given by the
geographers of the classical epoch to the cantons
bordering on the Gulf of Akabah. Sinuhit remained
there some years in the company of the nomad
archers or Sittiu ; on his return to Egypt, he was
received by the Egyptian garrison at the frontier
station of Hriu-horu, " the roads of Horus," that is to
say, of Pharaoh, who was identified with Horus
where this locality was I cannot say.
Five years of labour have allowed me to transcribe
and translate this difficult text. I believe that the
narrative portion of it may be considered as entirely
explained in almost every word. The petitions,
letters, and discourses with which the story is filled,
still present considerable difficulties. Many details
will doubtless have to be modified in the approaching
future.
VOL. II



THE ADVENTURES OF SINUHIT (TWELFTH DYNASTY)
The hereditary prince, the man of the king in his quality of sole Friend,' the jackal who makes the round of the frontiers to guard the country, the sovereign of the country of the SiTTiu, the veritable cousin of the king who loves his lord,^ the servant Sinuhit says : As for me, I am the servant of his master, the slave of the king, the superintendent of the palace, the hereditary prince honoured with the favour of the queen Usirtasen, one of the intimates ^ of the royal son Amenemhait, in his residence. In the year XXX, the 2d month of Shait, the 7th (day), the god entered his double horizon, the king Shotphttrt ascended to heaven,* and when he had united himself with the solar disk the gods rejoiced at the event. Within the palace there was nothing but distressed and mourning people ; the great gates were sealed ; the courtiers
^ The Friends occupied the highest posts in the court of the Pharaoh ; in the Papyrus Hood of the British Museum they are placed in the seventh grade after the king. They were divided into several groups : the '
' sole Friends," the " Friends of the Seraglio," the "golden Friends," and the "young," whose exact position cannot be determined. The title continued to be used in the court of the Ptolemies, and spread throughout the Macedonian world (see Maspero, £tudes dgyftiennes, ii. pp. 20, 21). ^ This introduction includes among the ordinary Egyptian titles that of "sovereign of the country of the Sirriu," or nomad archers of the Sinaitic Peninsula and the adjoining desert. Sinuhit had been chief of a tribe among them, and even after his return to Egypt, continued to bear the title at the court of the Pharaoh. The fact is a new one, which deserves to be noted by Egyptologists. ^ Literally "he who is among those who join the dwelling-house with the royal son," that is to s.^y, one of those who have the right of hving in the same house as the royal son. * That is to say, '

sat crouching in sign of mourning, the men were overcome by dolour and silence. Now his majesty had despatched an army to the country of the Timihu;^ his eldest son Usirtasen commanded it, forcefully he marched, he took prisoners alive among the Timihu as well as all their innumerable cattle. The Friends of the Seraglio sent people to the region of the west to inform the new king of the regency which had befallen them unexpectedly in the Palace.^ The messengers found him and reached him at nightfall ; whereas running was not sufficiently rapid, the Hawk flew with his servants ^ without informing the army, and as all the royal sons who were in the army were in the field, none of them was summoned. Now as for me, I was there, I heard the words which He uttered on this matter, and I felt myself sinking my heart palpitated, my arms drooped, the fear of the king smote all my limbs ; I wondered as I crept along where I could find a place wherein to hide myself ; * I flung myself into the midst of the thickets to wait (there) until they.^ had passed. Then I turned towards the south, not with the wish of reaching the palace, for I did not know whether war had broken out,^ and without even pronouncing a wish to live after the (former) sovereign, I turned my back on the (Canton of the) Sycomore. I reached Shi-Snofru and passed the night there on the soil of the field. I started again at daybreak and joined a man who was standing in the
' The Berber tribes inhabiting the Libyan desert, to the west of
Egypt. 2 On the death of the king, the Friends of the Seraglio had to undertake the duties of a regency during the absence of the heir. '' ' • The hawk who flies " is, according to Egyptian idiom, the new king,
identified with the hawk-god Haroiri, " Horus the elder," or Har-si-isit, " Horus the son of Isis. * Sinuhit avoids telling us by what accident he found himself in a position to hear, unlike every one else, the news which the messenger had
brought to the new king. We do not know whether the Egyptian law decreed death to the wretch who had committed such an act of indiscretion, even though it might have been involuntary ; all we know is that Sinuhit feared for his life and determined upon flight. 5 That is, the king and his attendants. ^ This passage must allude to t civil war. In Egypt, as in all Oriental
countries, a change of ruler often brings with-it a revolt ; the princes who have not been chosen to succeed their father taking up arms against their more fortunate brother.

middle of the road ; he implored my mercy, for he was afraid of me. Towards supper-time I approached the city of Khri-Ahu,^ and crossed the water on a barge without a rudder. I quitted the country of the west and passed over the eastern territory of Iauku to the domain of the goddess HiRiT the mistress of the Red Mountain;^ then I proceeded on foot straight towards the north, and I reached the walls of the prince, which he has constructed to repel the SiTTiu and to destroy the Nomiu-Shaiu ; I remained in a crouching posture among the bushes, for fear of being seen by the guard, relieved each day, which keeps watch from the summit of the fortress. I proceeded on my way at nightfall, and at dawn I reached Puteni and directed my steps to the Wady of QimoIri.^ Then thirst fell and darted upon me ; my throat rattled and contracted and I already said to myself: "It is the taste of death," when I rallied my heart and recalled my strength ; I heard afar the lowing
of cattle. A Sitti perceived me and recognised from my appearance that I came from Egypt. Behold he gave me water and boiled some milk for me ; I went with him to his tribe. They wished to give me a territory out of their territory, but I departed at once and hurried to the country of Edima.*
When I had passed a year there, Amu-anshi ^—he is
the prince of the Upper ToNU—bade me come and he said to me : " Dwell with me ; thou shalt hear the language of Egypt.'' He said this because he knew my worth and had heard of my merits, according to the testimony given of me by the Egyptians who were in the country.^ This is what he said to me : " What is the reason on account of which thou art come hither? Is it that there has been a death in the palace of the king of the two Egypts, even of
' Babylon, now Old Cairo.

Shotphitri,! without our having known what has passed on this occasion ? " I began to celebrate the king in a poetical effusion : "When I came from the country of the Timihu and my heart found for itself a new home, if I failed,^ it was not remorse for a fault which sent me on the paths of a fugitive ; I had not been negligent, my mouth had uttered no biting speech, I had listened to no perverse counsel, my name had not been heard in the mouth of the magistrate. I know not how I can explain what has led me into this country ; it is as it were by the will of God, for ever since the time when this land of Egypt was as it were in ignorance of this beneficent god [the king] the fear of whom is spread among foreign nations, like Sokhit ^ in a year of pestilence, I have declared to him my thought and replied to him : Save us ! * Behold now his son enters the palace in his place and has undertaken the direction of the affairs of his father. He is a god who verily has no
second ; none is before him. He is a master of wisdom, prudent in his designs, beneficent in his disposition, at whose good pleasure one goes and comes, for by his ability he subdues foreign regions, and even when his father was still
1 The question of the prince of Tonu, designedly somewhat obscure, was quite natural, since we know that Amenemhait I had fallen a victim to a palace conspiracy. Amu-anshi asks if Sinuhit has not been implicated in some attempt of the kind and has in consequence been compelled to fly from Egypt, 2 The text is so mutilated here that I cannot guarantee the sense. The part of the phrase which I translate *
' and my heart found for itself a new
liome" signifies literally "my heart was renewed there for me." The heart of Sinuhit was Egyptian ; by renewing itself it made him an Asiatic in the land of Tonu. Further on the hero is regarded as a Sitti. ' Sokhit or Sokhmit, long confounded with Pakhit, was one of the chief
goddesses of the Egyptian Pantheon. She belonged to the triad of Memphis and was entitled "the great friend of Phtah. " She was a lion or a goddess with the head of a lion ; with the head of a cat she was called Bastit and was adored at Bubastis. '' Sinuhit here answers the question of the prince of Tonu, as to whether his exile was not due to complicity in a plot against the life of the king. His flight was a fatality and he had served his sovereign from the period when he had not yet been recognised by all Egypt, and had prayed him to save his unhappy country, distracted by civil war, as we learn from other documents. Then the better to prove that he could never have mixed in any plot, he plunges into an eulogy of the new Pharaoh Usirtasen I. The exaggeration of the eulogy becomes a proof of loyalty and innocence.

in the interior of his palace, it was he who reaHsed what his father had determined should be accomplished. He is a hero who verily works with his sword, a champion who has no rival ; we see in him one who rushes against the barbarians and bursts upon the pillagers. He is a hurler of the javelin who makes feeble the hands of the enemy ; those whom he strikes can no longer lift the buckler. He is a fearless (hero) who crushes the skulls (of his foes) ; none has stood before him. He is a rapid runner who destroys the coward ; none is able to run after him. He is a heart resolute in its season. He is a lion who strikes with the claw ; never has he surrendered his arms. He is a heart closed to pity ; when he sees the multitudes he lets nothing remain behind him. He is a hero who flings himself forward when he sees resistance, he is a soldier who rejoices when he flings himself on the barbarians ; he seizes his buckler, he leaps, he has never had need to repeat his blow, he slays without its being possible to turn aside his lance, and even without his stretching his bow, the barbarians fly his two arms like greyhounds, for the great goddess ^ has granted unto him to combat those who know not his name, and if he attains (the prey) he lets nothing remain. He is a favourite who has known marvellously how to acquire love ; his country loves him more than itself and rejoices in him more than in its own god ; men and women hasten at his summons. As king he governs since he was in the egg ; ^ he himself, since his birth, is a multiplier of births, he is also an unique being, of the divine essence, by whom this earth rejoices at being governed. He is an enlarger of frontiers who will take the lands of the south, but covets not the lands of the north ; on the contrary, he has acted against the chiefs of the Sittiu and to destroy the Nomiu-Shaiu.^ Should he come here, let him know thy name by the homage thou wilt address to his majesty

For does he not do good to the foreign country which obeys him? The chief of Tonu answered me : " May the government of Egypt be fortunate, and may its prosperity be of long duration ! While thou art with me I will do good to thee !
"
He set me above his children, marrying me to his eldest daughter, and he granted that I should choose for myself in his domain, among the best of what he possessed on the frontier of a neighbouring country. It is an excellent country ; Aia is its name.^ There are figs in it and grapes; its wine is more plentiful than water ; abundant is the milk, numerous the olives and all the products of its trees; there are corn and meal without Hmit and every kind of cattle. It was noble, indeed, what he conferred on me, when the prince came to invest me (with the government), appointing me tribal 'prince in the best part of his country. I had daily rations of bread and wine for each day, cooked meat, roast fowl, together with the game that I caught or that was placed before me, over and above what my dogs brought from the chase. Plenty of butter ^ was made for me and boiled milk of every sort. I passed many years (there); the children I had became strong, each ruling his tribe. When a traveller went and returned from the interior, he turned aside from his road to visit me, for I rendered services to all the world. I gave water to the thirsty, I set on his journey the traveller who had been hindered from passing by, I chastised the brigand.

his soldiers. Every country towards which I marched, when I had made my invasion, they trembled on the pastures beside their wells ; I seized their cattle, I removed their vassals and I carried away their slaves, I slaughtered their population ;i (the country) lay at the mercy of my sword, my bow, my marches, my plans well-conceived and glorious for the heart of my prince. Thus he loved me when he
knew my valour, making me chief of his children, when he saw the vigour of my two arms.
A hero of Tonu came to defy me in my tent ; it was a hero who had no rivals, for he had destroyed them all. He exclaimed: "Let Sinuhit combat with me, for he has not yet smitten me," and he flattered himself that he would take my cattle for the use of his tribe. The prince deliberated thereupon with me. I said : " I know him not. Certainly I am not his brother, I keep myself at a distance from his abode ; have I ever opened his door or cleared his fences ? He is some jealous fellow who is envious at seeing me and who fancies himself summoned to despoil me of cats, of shegoats as well as of cows, and to throw himself on my bulls, on my sheep, and on my oxen, in order to take them for himself. If he is a wretch who thinks of enriching himself at my expense, not a Beduin and a Beduin skilled in fighting, then let him manage the matter with judgment! But if he is a bull who loves the battle, a choice bull who loves ever to have the last word, if he has the heart to fight, let him declare the intention of his heart ! Will God forget any one whom he has always favoured until now ? It is as if the challenger were already among those who are laid on the funeral couch ! " I strung my bow, I took out my arrows, I agitated my dagger, I furbished up my arms. At dawn, the country of Tonu came together ; it had collected its tribes, (and) convoked all the foreign lands which were dependent on it ; it desired this combat. Each heart burned for me, men and women shouted " Ah 1 " for every heart
' These are the phrases used in the official reports to describe the ravages of the wars carried on by the Pharaohs. Usirtasen III says similarly : "I have taken their women, I have removed their vassals, manifesting myself towards their wells, chasing before me their cattle, devastating their houses and setting them on fire."

was anxious on my account, and they said : " Is it really a strong man that is going to fight with him ? See, his adversary has a buckler, a battle-axe, an armful of javelins." When I had gone forth, and he had appeared, I turned his darts aside from me.''- As not a single one hit (me), he flung himself upon me, and then I discharged my bow at him, when my dart buried itself in his neck, he cried and struck himself on the nose ; I caused his lance to fall, I lifted up my shout of victory over his back. While all the people rejoiced, I caused his vassals whom he had oppressed to show their gratitude to Montu ^ in deed. The prince Ammi-anshi^ gave me all that the conquered one possessed, and then I carried away his goods, I took his cattle ; that which he desired to make me do I made him do ; I seized what there was in his tent, I despoiled his abode ; so that the riches of my treasures increased and the number of my cattle.
Now behold what God has done for me who have trusted in him. He who had deserted and fled to a foreign land, now each day his heart is joyous. I saved myself by flight from the place where I was, and now good testimony is rendered to me here. After I had fainted, dying of hunger, now I give bread here where I am. I had quitted my country naked and behold I am clothed in fine linen. After having been a fugitive without servants, behold I possess numerous serfs. My house is beautiful, my domain large, my memory is established in the temple of all the gods.* And nevertheless I take refuge always in thy good

As for him, he hears the distant prayer, and he starts, directing his course towards the country where he has trodden the earth for the first time, towards the place from whence he is come. I was once at peace with the king of Egypt, I lived on his gifts, I performed my duties towards the " Regent of the Earth "^ who is in his palace, I listened to the conversation of his children ; ah ! the youthful vigour of my limbs was his !

female Osiris is intended. We know too little about the religion of the

'* The praenomen of Usirtasen I. the son and successor of Amenemhait I. " The Egyptians, like all oriental peoples, attached a great importance not only to the words which composed their religious formulte, but also to the intonation given to each of them. For a prayer to be of avail and to exercise its full effect upon the gods, it was necessary that it should be recited in the traditional cadence. Accordingly the highest praise which could be bestowed on a person obliged to recite an orison, was to call him md-khr6u

' The Egyptian word properly signifies "ayoung man,'' and represented one of the degrees of the hierarchy of the court.

I believe it means that the king declares himself satisfied with the tone of Sinuhit's letter and with the temper it betrays. ^ This name signifies literally "linen, bandages ;" the goddess presided over the swaddling of an infant and the enshrouding of the deceased. The ceremonies here alluded to are described in a special treatise which I have published and translated under the title of Rituel de r Embaumenient (in my Mdmoire sur quelques Papyrus du Louvre).

middle of my tribe. When it was handed to me, having thrown myself on the stomach I lay upon the ground, I
crawled upon my breast,^ and so I made the circuit of my

He reigned over the deserts which extend eastward of Egypt between the Nile

that ToNU has not growled against thee within itself after the fashion of thy greyhounds. For as to me who speak
to you, my flight, if it has been voluntary, was not premeditated ; far from plotting it, I could not tear myself from the spot where I was ; it was like a trance, like the dream of a man of Athu who sees himself at Abu,* of a man of the plain of Egypt who sees himself in the mountain.^ I dreaded nothing; there was no pursuit after me, my name had never been in the mouth of the herald up to the moment when fate assailed me, but then my legs

' he who is in Kaushu " (or Kush), and hence denotes a native of Ethiopia. The neighbourhood of Edimi, however, rather indicates here some Syrian locality. [Compare the
application of the term " Ethiopian "or " Kushite " to the Midianite wife of Moses in Numbers .\ii. Ed.]
' Rendered " the country of the Phoenicians " by Brugsch and others. Without entering into the question whether the Egyptian word Fonkhu really denotes Phoenicia, it is sufBcient to say that the word is not really met with in this passage. But I do not know what region is intended by the phrase. * Abu was the Egyptian name of Elephantine, opposite Assuin, Athu that of a district in the Delta. The two places, like Dan and Beersheba in the Old Testament, proverbially indicated the whole length of Egypt. The difference between a Northern and Southern Egyptian extended not only to manners but even to dialect, so that the unintelligible language of a bad writer is compared to the conversation of a man of Abu who finds himself at Athu. ^ Literally "in the land of Khonti."

As for me who speak to thee, I will bequeath my goods to the generations which I have begotten in this place. And as to the messenger who is come unto me, let thy majesty do as it hears ; for we live on the air thou givest ; thine august nostril is the love of Ra, of Horus (and) of Hathor, it is the will of MoNTU master of Thebes that thou livest eternally." I celebrated a festival in Aia to hand over my property to my children : my eldest son was chief of my tribe, all
my property passed to him, and I gave away all my cattle as well as my plantations of every species of fruit-tree. When I travelled towards the south and arrived at HriuHoR, the governor, who was there at the head of the garrison, despatched a messenger to the palace to give information of the fact. His majesty sent the excellent superintendent of the peasants of the king and, with him, a ship laden with presents from the king for the Sittiu who came in my train to conduct me to Hriu-Hor. I addressed by his name each of those who were there ; as there were servants of every kind, I received and could carry with me means of subsistence and clothing sufficient to last me until I arrived at an estate belonging to me. When the earth revealed itself the following morning, each of them came to salute me, each of them departed. I had a prosperous journey as far as the palace j the introducers struck the ground with their foreheads before me, the [royal] Children stood in the hall to conduct me, the Friends who betook themselves to the hall of audience for the march-past set me on the way to the Royal Lodge. I found his majesty on the great platform in the Hall of Silver-gilt ; ^ when I entered towards it, I sank on my

stomach, I lost consciousness of myself in his presence. The god addressed me with kindly words, but I was like a person suddenly blinded, my tongue failed, my limbs fainted, my heart was no longer in my breast, and I knew what is the difference between life and death. His majesty said to one of the Friends : " Let him be raised and speak to me ! " His majesty said : " So then thou art returned ! In hanging about foreign lands and playing the fugitive, age has attacked thee, thou hast reached old age, thy body is not a little worn out. Dost thou not rise ? Art thou become a Sitti in duplicity, for thou dost not answer? Declare thy name." I feared to refuse, and replied thus in
answer : " I am afraid ; nevertheless to that which my master has asked me, this is what I reply : I have not called upon myself the hand of God, but it is fear, yea, fear which seized my heart so that I took the fatal flight. 1 Now, behold me again before thee ; thou art life ; let thy
majesty do what he will ! The march-past of the Children ended, his majesty said to the queen : " This is Sinuhit who comes like a rustic with the appearance of a Sitti." The Children burst into a loud shout of laughter all together and said before his
majesty : " It is not he in truth, O sovereign, my master ! His majesty said : " It is he in truth." Then they took their necklaces, their wands of office, their sistra,^ and after
they had brought them to his majesty [they said] : " May

1 Sinuhit protests his innocence more than once. We have seen already
that the circumstances connected with his flight gave reason for a suspicion
that he was concerned in a plot against the king. Moreover, the treaty
between Ramses II and the prince of the Hittites shows with what care
the Pharaoh endeavoured to recover those of his subjects who had deserted
to the foreigner. Hence the repeated attempts of Sinuhit to clear himself.
2 The ceremonial of the Pharaoh's court included songs prescribed
beforehand as in the court of the Byzantine emperors. The Children
having saluted the king, commence this part of the ceremonial ; they
resume their ornaments, which had been laid aside before the march-past
and the adoration of the king, and along with their ornaments the sistrum
on which they accompanied their song.
3 This seems to mean, act with clemency. Several divimties bore the title of Mistress of Heaven.

He shall be among the Friends of the order of the Young, and let him be placed among those of the Circle* who are admitted into the Royal Lodge.

Ed.] "f ' This variant of the name of Sinuhit, due to the caprice of the scribe, signifies literally " the son of the North." Sinuhit is called " the Sitti on account of his long sojourn among the Beduin. To-miri, " the land of the canals," was a name of the Delta which was also applied to the whole of Egypt. ^ Persons attached to the court of the Pharaoh received two collective titles, that of Shonitiu, or "people of the Circle," who surrounded the sovereign, and that of Qahitiu, or " people of the Angle," perhaps those who stood in the angles of the hall of audience. " The RuH, or with the article P-ruti, is like Pimi-Aa, " Pharaoh," a topographical name which first denoted the palace of the monarch and then the monarch himself. It is from this title that the Greek legend of Proteus king of Egypt was derived, who received Helen and Paris and Menelaos at his court (Herodot, ii. 112-116).

divine decorations and mandates on the treasury for silver, vestments of royal materials, for royal gums and essences, such as the young like to have in every house, as well as every sort of artisan in numbers. As the years had passed over my limbs and I had lost my hair, I was given what came from foreign lands, and the materials of the' NomiushAiu ; I arrayed myself in fine linen, I bedewed myself with essences, I lay on a bed, I was given cakes to eat and oil wherewith to anoint myself. I was given a whole house suitable for one who is among the Friends ; I had plenty of materials for building it, all its timbers were repaired and fruits of the palace were brought to me three and four times a day, besides that which the children gave
without ever an instant's cessation. A pyramid of stone was begun for me in the midst of the funerary pyramids,^ the chief of the land surveyors of his majesty selected its site, the chief of the architects planned it, the chief of the stone-cutters sculptured it, the chief of the works which are executed in the necropolis traversed the land of Egypt to obtain all the materials necessary for its decoration. When the necessary appointments had been made in the pyramid itself, I took peasants and made there a lake,^ a kiosk,^
1 The facts which are mentioned here and there in the sepulchral inscriptions are here united in a continuous narrative. Sinuhit receives from Usirtasen the supreme favour, a tomb built and endowed at the expense of the Pharaoh. The site is given to him gratuitously, the pyramid constructed, the funerary feasts instituted, the revenues and endowments intended for the support of the sacrifices are levied on the royal domains ; finally, the statue itself which should sustain the double of Sinuhit is of precious metal.
2 A lake, or rather a piece of water surrounded with a border of stone, was the indispensable ornament of every comfortable country-house. The ideal tomb being above all things the image of the terrestrial house care was taken to place in it a lake like the lake of a villa ; the deceased sailed over it in a boat drawn by his slaves, or sat on its banks under the shade of its trees. ' The kiosk was, like the lake, an indispensable adjunct of a garden. The bas-reliefs of Thebes represent it in the midst of trees, sometimes on the edge of the lake. Its construction was simple ; a flooring raised two or three steps above the ground, four slender columns supporting a painted cornice and a slightly sloping roof, the sides open to admit the breeze, and a balustrade, breast-high, on three sides. The defunct came there like the living, to converse with his wife, to read stories or to play with the ladies.

the favour of the king until the day of death. — [The history]
is completed from the commencement to the end as has been found in the book.
^ The fields of the sepulchral domain were the property of the deceased, and furnished him with all he required. Each of them produced a special object, or the revenue derived from them was devoted to procuring for the defunct a special object of food or clothing, and bore the name of the object in question ; that, for example, from which Ti derived his figs was called '
' the figs of Ti. " The property was administered by the priests of the '
' double " or of the funereal statue, who were frequently the priests of the principal temple of the locality where the tomb was situated. The family made a contract with them, in accordance with which they engaged the necessary sacrifices for the well-being of the deceased in exchange for certain rents paid by the domains which were bequeathed to the tomb.



THE LEGEND OF THE EXPULSION OF THE HYKSOS
Translated by Professor Maspeeo
The story of the quarrel between the Shepherd-king
Apopi and Soqnun-ri the hereditary prince of Thebes,
which eventually led to the expulsion of the Hyksos
from Egypt, is found, though unfortunately in a
mutilated condition, in the first pages of the Papyrus
Sallier I. The value of a historical document has
long been attributed to it ; but its style, as well as
the expressions and the general character of the
subject, imply a romance, where the principal parts
in the scene are played by persons who belong to
real history, though the scene itself is almost entirely
the offspring of the popular imagination.
Champollion thrice saw the papyrus in the hands
of its original owner, M. Sallier of Aix in Provence,
in 1828, some days before his departure for Egypt,
and in 1830 on his return. The notes published by
Salvolini prove that he had recognised, if not the
exact nature of the story, at all events the historical
significance of the royal names occurring in it. The
manuscript, purchased in 1839 by the British

Museum, was published in facsimile (in 1841) in the
Select Papyri, vol. i. pi. i sqq. ; the notice by Hawkins,
evidently compiled from information given by Birch,
furnishes the name of the antagonist of Apophis,
which had not been read by Champollion, but it
attributes the cartouche of Apophis to king Phiops
of the fifth dynasty. E. de Roug^ was the first who
actually understood the contents of the first pages of
the papyrus. Already in 1847 he gave Soqnun-rt
his true place in the list of the Pharaohs ; in 1854
he pointed out the name of Hiuaru or Avaris in
the fragment and inserted in \.h.Q Atke'ncEum Franqais
1854, p. 352, a fairly detailed analysis of the docu
ment. The discovery was popularised in Germany
by Brugsch, who attempted to render the three first
lines word for word {^gyptische Studien, ii. 1854),
then in England by Goodwin, who believed himself
able to offer a complete translation of the papyrus
(" Hieratic Papyri " in the Cambridge Essays, 1858, pp.
243-245). Since then, the text has been frequently
studied, by Chabas {Les Pasteurs en Egypte, 1 868),
by Lushington {Fragment of thefirst Saltier Papyrus
in the Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archae
ology, iv. pp. 263-266, reproduced in the first series

Goodwin, after mature examination, hesitatingly ad
vanced the opinion that an accurate narrative indeed
could not be found in it, but only a historical novel

(in the English translation of Bunsen's Egypts Place
in History, iv. p. 671). It is the opinion which I
share, and which appears to have generally prevailed.
The transcription and translation of the text and a
commentary upon it are given in my Etudes igypti
ennes, i. pp. 195-216; the translation alone is re
produced in my Contes ^gyptiens, 2d Edit, pp. 273
286.
I believe the existing fragments allow us to
restore almost the whole of the first two pages.
Perhaps the attempt at restoration which I propose
will appear adventurous even to Egyptologists ; at
all events it will be seen that I have not undertaken
it rashly. A minute analysis of the text has led me
to the results which I here submit to criticism.



THE LEGEND OF THE EXPULSION OF THE HYKSOS
It happened that the land of Egypt belonged to the Impure,^ and as there was no lord monarch that day, it happened then that the king Soqnun-rl ^ was sovereign over the country of the South, and that the Impure of the city of Ra ^ were subject to Ra-Apopi * in Hauaru ; ^ the entire country paid him tribute together with its manufactured products and so loaded him with all the good things of To-miri.8 Now the king Ra-Ap6pi took the god Sutekhu for his master, and he no longer served any (other) deity who was in the whole country excepting only SuTEKHtr, and he built a temple of excellent and imperishable workmanship at the gate of the king Ra-Ap6pi, and he arose each day to sacrifice daily victims to Sutekhu ; and the vassal chiefs of the sovereign were there with garlands of flowers, just as is the case in the temple of Ph-Ra-Har-ma
1 This is one of the insulting epithets lavished by the resentment of the scribes on the Shepherds or Hyksos and the other foreigners who had occupied Egypt. ^ This is the most probable pronunciation of the name usually and wrongly transcribed Ra-skenen. Three kings of Egypt bore this fraenomen, two of the name of Tiu-^a and one of the name of Tiu-4a-qen, who reigned some years before Ahmosi the founder of the Eighteenth Dynasty. 2 That is Heliopolis, the On of the North, the daughter of whose priest was married by Joseph. ^ As it had been repeatedly advanced that Ap6pi, being an Hyksos, could not possibly add the title of Ra to his name, I beg to state here that the dot which represents the cursive hieratic form of the disk is as perfectly legible in the original manuscript as it is in the facsimile. ^ The Avaris of Manetho, the Egyptian fortress of the Shepherd-kings. E. de Roug^ has shown that Avari^ was one of the names of Tanis, the Zoan of the Old Testament. " Lower Egypt.



THE EXPULSION OF THE HYKSOS 41
khuti. And the king Ra-Ap6pi bethought himself of sending a message to announce it to the king Soqnun-ri, the prince of the city of the South.^ And many days after that, the king Ra-Ap6pi summoned his great chiefs. . . . [The text is interrupted here and begins again at the top of page 2 : when it recommences after an almost complete lacuna of five lines and a half we find phrases which evidently belong to the message of king Apopi. Now numerous texts teach us that a message entrusted to a person is always repeated by him almost word for word ; we can therefore feel convinced that the two lines put into the mouth of the envoy on page 2, were already contained in the lost lines of page i, and in fact, the small isolated fragment at the foot of the published facsimile contains the remains of characters which exactly correspond to the sentences of the message. This first version of the message, accordingly, was put into the mouth of the royal councillors; but who were these councillors ? Were they the " great chiefs " who were summoned at the point where the text breaks off ? That is impossible, as in the fragments of line 7 mention is made of " the learned scribes," and in line 2 of page 2 it is expressly stated that Apopi sent to Soqnun-ri the message " which his learned scribes had repeated to him." We must therefore admit that Apopi, after consulting his civil and military chiefs, was counselled to apply to his scribes. The words of the latter begin at the end of line 7 with the customary exclamation : " O suzerain, our master !" In short, for the whole of this first part of the lacuna we have a consultation similar to that carried on afterwards at the court of Soqnun-ri, and in the story of the Two Brothers, when the Pharaoh desires to discover the owner of the curl which perfumed his linen. Consequently I continue the tale as follows :] And many days after that, the king Ra-Ap6pi summoned his great chiefs, as well as his captains and his prudent generals, but they could not suggest to him a speech which was good to send to the king Soqnun-ri the chief of the country of the South. So the king Apopi summoned his scribes versed in magic. They

said to him : " O suzerain, our master." . . y and they suggested to the king Ra-Ap6pi the discourse which he desired : " Let a messenger go to the chief of the city of the South and say to him : The king Ra-Ap6pi sends to say ; Let the hippopotamuses which are in the canals of the country be chased on the pool, in order that they may allow sleep to visit me night and day. . . ." [A line and a half, perhaps even more, still remains to be supplied. Here again, the sequel permits us to restore the sense, if not the letter, of what is wanting in the text. We see that after having received the message recounted above, king Soqnun-ri assembles his council, which is perplexed and at a loss for an answer ; whereupon king Apopi sends a second embassy. It is evident that the embarrassment and silence of the Thebans were foreseen by the scribes of Apopi, and that the part of their advice which is preserved at the top of page 2 contained the end of the second message which Apopi was to send, if the first met with no reply. In similar stories, some extraordinary action is described which has to be performed by one of two kings ; the penalty is always stated to which he must submit in case of ill-success and the reward he will receive in case of success. There must have been a similar description in the Legend, and I therefore propose to restore the text as follows ;] He will not know what to answer, whether good or bad : then thou shalt send him another message : " The king RaApopi sends saying : If the chief of the South cannot answer my message, let him serve no other god than SuteKHU ! But if he answers it, and does that which I bid him do,2 then I will take nothing from him, and I will no more bow down before any other god of the land of Egypt except Amon-Ra the king of the gods !" And many days after that, the king Ra-Ap6pi sent to the prince of the country of the South the message which his scribes versed in magic had suggested to him ; and the messenger of the king Ra-Ap6pi came to the chief of the

land of the South. He said to the messenger of the king Ra-Ap6pi .• " What message dost thou bring to the land of the South ? Why hast thou made this journey ? " The messenger replied : " The king Ra-Ap6pi sends to say Let the hippopotamuses which are in the canals of the country be chased on the pool, in order that they may allow sleep to visit me day and night. ..." The chief of the land of the South was astounded and knew not what answer to make to the messenger of the king Ra-Ap6pi. So the chief of the land of the South said to the messenger : " This is what thy master sends to . . . the chief of the land of the South . . . the words which he has sent me ... his goods. ..." The chief of the land of the South caused all kinds of good things, meats, cakes, . . . (and) wine to be given to the messenger ; then he said to him " Return and tell thy master ... all that which thou hast said, I approve. ..." The messenger of the king RaApopi set himself to return to the place where his master was. Then the chief of the South summoned his great chiefs as well as his captains and his able generals, and he repeated to them all the message which the king Ra-Ap6pi had sent to him. Then they were silent with a single mouth for a long moment (of time), and did not know what answer to make whether good or bad. The king Ra-Ap6pi sent to the chief of the land of the South the other message which his scribes versed in magic had suggested to him. . . . [It is unfortunate that the text is broken just in this place. The three Pharaohs who bore the name of Soqnun-ri reigned during a troublous period and must have left enduring memories in the minds of the Theban people. They were active and warlike princes, and the last of them perished by a violent death, perhaps in battle against the Hyksos. He had shaved his beard the morning before, " arraying himself for the combat like the god Montu," as the Egyptian scribes would say. His courage led him to penetrate too far into the ranks of the enemy ; he was surrounded and slain before his companions could rescue him. The blow of an axe removed part of his left cheek and laid

bare the teeth, striking the jaw and felling him stunned to the ground ; a second blow entered far within the skull, a dagger or short lance splitting the forehead on the right side a little above the eye. The Egyptians recovered the body and embalmed it in haste, when already partially decomposed, before sending it to Thebes and the tomb of his ancestors. The features of the mummy, now in the Museum of Boulaq, still show the violence and fury of the struggle ; a large white piece of brain is spread over the forehead, the retracted lips uncover the jaw and the tongue is bitten between the teeth.^ The author of the Legend may probably have continued his story down to the tragic end of his hero. The scribe to whom we owe the papyrus on which it is inscribed must certainly have intended to complete the tale ; he had recopied the last lines on the reverse of one of the pages, and was preparing to continue it when some accident intervened to prevent his doing so. Perhaps the professor at whose dictation he appears to have written did not himself know the end of the Legend. It is probable, however, that it went on to describe how Soqnun-ri, after long hesitation, succeeded in escaping from the embarrassing dilemma in which his powerful rival had attempted to place him. His answer must have been as odd and extraordinary as the message of Apopi, but we have no means even of conjecturing what it was.]

THE STELE OF THOTHMES IV (OF THE EIGHTEENTH DYNASTY)
Translated by D. Mallet
This stele had been buried for ages, under the sand
which again and again has covered the body of the
Sphinx, when it was disinterred in 1818 by an
Englishman, Captain Caviglia. Salt, who had taken
part in his friend's excavations, gave a detailed
account of the disinterment, and his narrative,
preserved in MS. at the British Museum, has been
published by Col. Vyse in the appendix to his
work on the Operations carried on at the Pyramids
of Gizeh (Svo, London 1842, vol. iii. pp. 107 sqq^
After uncovering all the hinder portion of the
Sphinx, Caviglia found at the end of the long
passage which lay between the paws, a small temple,
ten feet in length by five in breadth, immediately
below the chin of the figure. The extremity of it
was occupied by a block of granite, fourteen feet in
height, covered with sculptures and hieroglyphics
recording the name of Thothmes IV ; this block is
the stele of which we are about to give a translation.
It was set up against the breast of the Sphinx,



46 RECORDS OF THE PAST
without, however, actually touching it. The two
walls, built along the paws at right angles to that
at the end of the shrine, had been adorned with two
other stelae of smaller size and of limestone ; one of
them, containing the name of Ramses II, was still
in situ ; the other had fallen into the interior of the
chapel among other masses of rubbish, in which
fragments of the beard once attached to the chin of
the figure, as in the case of all Egyptian figures of
gods or kings, could still be recognised. A door
opened between the two walls of lesser elevation
which enclosed the shrine on the eastern side.
Before the temple, a sort of paved court extended
about three-fourths of the length of the paws, and
was also enclosed by two walls separated from one
another by a roofless opening before which was
erected a square altar of granite.
Caviglia succeeded in uncovering the Sphinx as
' far as the base, over an area of more than one
hundred feet. Unfortunately the sand of the desert
soon recommenced its work, and later Lepsius, and
subsequently the Due de Luynes, had again to
undertake the task of removing it at great expense
in order to reach the curious stele of Thothmes IV.
In 1880 Mariette undertook new and important
excavations on the same spot. Like Caviglia, he
brought to light the huge staircase of two stages
which descends from the plateau of the desert and
led the curious and the devout to the extremity
of the shrine, where the colossal image of the god



THE STELE OF THOTHMES IV 47
Harmakhis, as embodied in the Sphinx, rises from
the ground ; and he recognised the remains of
buildings, the existence of which had already been
noticed by his predecessor. Prof Maspero, Mariette's
successor as Director- General of excavations in
Egypt, was anxious to push the work of exploration
yet further. Ancient authors, Pliny among others, had
stated that the body of the' Sphinx contained a royal
tomb, and Arab writers had recounted all sorts of
marvellous legends on the subject. Certain Egyptian
monuments, moreover, represented the Sphinx as
lying on a lofty pedestal and adorned with those
prismatic grooves of which the architects of the Old
Empire were so fond.^ This pedestal might enclose
the tomb of which Pliny speaks, and might have
been buried in the sand as far back as the age of
Khafri (Khephren) of the fourth dynasty. To solve
the problem it was necessary to lower the level of
the soil as far as the rocky platform on which the
monument stands, and thus to restore it to the
condition in which it was towards the commencement
of the second century of our era. Then soundings
would have to be taken in order to see whether the
supposed tomb existed or not. A sum of i 5,000
francs, collected by subscription by the Journal des
Debats, allowed the work of clearing away the sand
to begin in the winter of 1885-6 and to be followed

up with great activity.^ After the departure of Prof.
Maspero from Egypt, however, the work was
interrupted, and the question accordingly has not
yet been settled.
The stele of Thothmes IV is of peculiar import
ance for the history of the Sphinx. It furnishes, in
fact, two landmarks for periods very distant from
one another. Towards the middle of it, mention is
made of Khafri, the third king of the fourth dynasty,
in terms which the state of the stone unfortunately
does not permit us to determine quite exactly.
They have been held by some to imply that the
monument was constructed by that king. It is
probable, however, that it is much more ancient,
mounting back, perhaps, to the ages preceding
Menes. To Khafri would have fallen the task of
clearing away for the first time during the historical
period the masses of sand which had already almost
covered it. Towards the fifteenth century B.C. the
work had to be done again, and Thothmes IV, in
consequence of a dream, undertook in his turn to
disclose the image of the god to the veneration of its
worshippers. The work was doubtless difficult, and
once achieved he determined to preserve the memory
of it. He accordingly caused a stele to be made,
and inscribed upon it an account of his vision and
of the labours which had been the result of it.
However, he did not go to any great expense in
1 Maspero, Rapport sur les fouilles dc 1885-6 in the Bulktin de
V Institut igypHen, 1886.



THE STELE OF THOTHMES IV 49
searching for stone ; instead of transporting a new
block from Syene " he took one of the architraves of
the neighbouring temple, now called the temple of
the Sphinx, and engraved upon it his inscription,
without troubling himself even to smooth the
reverse." ^
As for the text, it had been copied by Salt in
1818, and his copy is at present in the British
Museum among the papers which have been alluded
to above. It was published by Young in his
Hieroglyphics (London, 1820, pi. 80), and afterwards
reproduced more imperfectly in Vyse's work on the
Pyramids of Gizeh (London, 1842, iii. Appendix,
pi. 6). Lepsius gave a new and more correct copy
of it in his Denkmdler (iii. pi. 68), but the copy was
less complete in certain parts, the monument having
suffered during the interval of time which had
separated his journey from that of Caviglia and
Salt.
Birch explained some fragments of the inscription
in the work of Vyse in 1842. The historical
portion has been translated into German by Brugsch
{Zeitschrift fiir Aegyptische Sprache, 1876, pp. 89
sqq^, and this translation has been reproduced in the
German and English editions of his History of
Egypt.
Birch gave the first complete translation of it in
the twelfth volume of the former series of Records of
the Past. It has been further explained word by

word and commented on by M. Pierret in his lectures
at the Ecole du Louvre 1885-6, Prof. Maspero,
finally, has analysed the whole and translated several
lines of the text in his Rapport a Vlnstitut igyptien
siir les foinlles de 1885-6 (in the Bulletin de I'lnstitut
^gyptien, 1886).
At the head of the stele the solar disk, with its
two uraei serpents and two great wings, commands
the two scenes which occupy the first compartment.
On the left the king, in a wig crowned by the uraeus,
presents in his two uplifted hands a large-bodied
vase to the divine sphinx with human head, who
reclines on a lofty pedestal. Above is an inscription
which occupies all the length of the scene : " The
King of the South and of the North, Men-khopiruRi Thothmos Khakeu who grants life stable and
pure." And the god replies : " I have given life
stable and pure to the master of the two lands
Thothmos Khakeu." In front of the king is a short
legend, much injured, which contained the words : " Homage of the vase Nemast."
On the right the king, in a helmet, with the left
hand presents the sphinx, reclined on a pedestal
similar to the other but turned in the opposite
direction, with incense which smokes in a vase, and
with the right hand offers a libation which he pours
over an altar of very elongated form. Above the
head of the king is the same formula as before : " The King of the South and of the North, Menkhopiru-Ri Thothmos Khakeu." And Harmakhis



THE STELE OF THOTHMES IV 51
replies : " I have given the sword to the master of
the two lands, Thothmos Khakeu."
Between the two scenes, below the disk, is a
vertical inscription, which occupies all the upper part
of the first compartment and passes between the two
figures of the sphinxes, which lie back to back. It
runs thus : " I have caused Men-khopiru-Ri to rise
on the throne of See, Thothmos Khakeu in the
function of TUM."
The pedestals on which the two sphinxes recline
consist of three horizontal platforms, and of a wall
which is ornamented alternately with incised squares
and rectangles, interrupted towards the extremities
by four designs, symmetrically arranged and some
what resembling the leaves of trefoil. It is this
decoration which has already been noted above,
and which is found on monuments of the Old
Empire.
An irregular fracture, which commences towards
the twelfth line of the inscription, runs from right to
left, leaving intact only a part of the two following
lines. The measurements taken by Lepsius
{Denkmdler, iii. pi. 68) allow us to determine the
extent of the text which has been destroyed. The
monument was originally 7 ft. 2 in. in length and
II ft. 10 in. in height. Now the hieroglyphics
have been destroyed to a height of nearly 4 ft. on
the left side, of 4 ft. 4 in. in the middle, and of 5 ft.
4 in. on the right side. Taking no notice of the
double tableau, which forms the upper compartment



S2 RECORDS OF THE PAST
of the stele, we see that nearly one half of the
inscription has become illegible.
The conclusion must have contained the answer
of Thothmos to the words of the god, and then a
recital of the works which were executed in accord
ance with his commands. It ended, doubtless, with
a dithyramb in honour of the monarch, Harmakhis
assuring to him a glorious reign as a reward for his
piety. As a matter of fact, Thothmos had hardly
ascended the throne before he commenced the work
and erected the stele. Then the sand of the desert
recommenced to rise little by little, and probably as
far back as the fourteenth or thirteenth century B.C.
the Sphinx was already enshrouded by it again. In
the Greek and Roman epochs it was once more
removed several times. The staircase was constructed
which gave access to the temple, and numerous
tourists were able to engrave their names on the
wall of the temple and the paws of the Sphinx. In
spite of much trouble and expense, the savans of
the nineteenth century have not yet succeeded in
completely disinterring this unique monument of
primeval Egypt or in discovering its hidden secret.

TABLETS OF TEL EL-AMARNA RELATING TO PALESTINE IN THE CENTURY BEFORE THE EXODUS
Translated by the Editor
In the winter of 1887 a very remarkable discovery
was made among the mounds of Tel el-Amarna in
Upper Egypt. Tel el-Amarna lies on the eastern bank of the Nile about midway between Minieh and
Siout, and its extensive ruins cover the site of the
capital of Amenophis IV, or Khu-en-Aten, the so
called " Heretic King " of the eighteenth Egyptian
dynasty. Khu-en-Aten was the son of Amen6phis
III by a Syrian princess Teie, who, as we now know
was the daughter of Duisratta, the king of Mitanni or
Nahrina, the Aram Naharaim of Scripture (Judges iii.
8), a Mesopotamian district which lay opposite to
the Hittite city of Carchemish. Like his father,
Khu-en-Aten surrounded himself with Semitic officers
and courtiers, and after his accession to the throne
publicly professed himself a convert to the religion
of his mother, which consisted in the adoration of the
winged solar disk, called Aten in Egyptian. His
rejection of the faith of his fathers soon brought



58 RECORDS OF THE PAST
about a rupture with the powerful priesthood of
Thebes, and Khu-en-Aten eventually left his ancestral
capital and built himself and his followers a new
capital further north, the site of which is now known
as Tel el-Amarna. Here in the neighbouring cliffs
and desert are found the tombs of the adherents of
the new Egyptian creed, and here Khu-en-Aten
reigned and died. He was succeeded by one or two
converts to the foreign religion ; but their reigns were
brief, and after a short while the Pharaoh returned to
the worship of the Egyptian gods, the new capital of
Khu-en-Aten was deserted, and the foreign faith
suppressed.
On his departure from Thebes, Khu-en-Aten had
carried with him the archives of the kingdom, and it
is a portion of these that the fellahin discovered in
1887 among the foundations of the royal palace.
They consist of clay tablets inscribed with cuneiform
writing of the Babylonian type and in the Babylonian
language. The tablets are copies of letters and
despatches from the kings and governors of Babylonia
and Assyria, of Syria, Mesopotamia, and Eastern
Kappadokia, of Phcenicia and Palestine, and they
prove that all over the civilised East, in the century
before the Exodus, active literary intercourse was
carried on through the medium of a common
literary language—that of Babylonia, and the compli
cated Babylonian script. It is evident, therefore, that
throughout Western Asia schools and libraries must
have existed, in which clay tablets inscribed with



TABLETS OF TEL EL-AMARNA 59
cuneiform characters were stored up, and where the
language and syllabary of Babylonia were taught
and learned. Such a library must have existed in
the Canaanite city of Kirjath-Sepher or "Book
town" (Judges i. 1 1), and if its site can ever be
recovered and excavated we may expect to find there
its collection of books written upon imperishable
clay.
Among the correspondents of the Egyptian
sovereigns were Assur-yuballidh of Assyria and
Burna-buryas of Babylonia, which thus fix the date
of Khu-en-Aten to about 1430 B.C. Palestine and
Phoenicia were garrisoned at the time by Egyptian
troops, and there were as yet no traces of the Israelite
in the land. But the Canaanitish population was
already threatened by an enemy from the north.
These were the Hittites, to whom references are made
in several of the despatches from Syria and Phoenicia.
After the weakening of the Egyptian power in conse
quence of the religious troubles which followed the
death of Khu-en-Aten, the Hittites were enabled to
complete their conquests in the south and to drive
a wedge between the Semites of the East and the
West. With the revival of the Egyptian empire under the rulers of the nineteenth dynasty the south
ward course of Hittite conquest was checked, but the
wars of Ramses II against the Hittites of Kadesh on
the Orontes desolated and exhausted Canaan and
prepared the way for the Israelitish invasion.
Two facts of special interest to the Biblical student



6o RECORDS OF THE PAST
result from the discovery of the tablets of Tel el
Amarna. In the first place, as has been seen, the
date of the Exodus has been approximately deter
mined ; at all events, the Egyptologists have been
shown to be right in not assigning it to an earlier
period than B.C. 1320, that is to say, the reign of
Meneptah the son and successor of Ramses II. In
the second place, light is thrown upon the statement
of Exodus (i. 8) that the Pharaoh of the oppression
was " a new king which knew not Joseph." We learn
from the tablets that Khu-en-Aten was not only half
Semitic in descent and wholly Semitic in faith, he
also surrounded himself with officers and courtiers of
Phoenician or Canaanitish extraction. The Vizier
himself, who stood next to the monarch, and like him
is addressed as " lord," bore the name of Dudu, the
Dodo and David of the Old Testament, which
belonged specifically to the land of Canaan. Most
of the Egyptian governors and lieutenants from whom
the king received his despatches had similarly Semitic
names, and it is clear that not only were Semitic
culture and religion dominant in Egypt, but most of
the offices of state were in Semitic hands. The rise
of the nineteenth dynasty under Ramses I. marked
the reaction against Semitic influence, and brought
with it the expulsion of the foreigner. Thebes became
once more the capital of the kingdom, and the
Egyptian priesthood and aristocracy took their re
venge upon the hated stranger. Had the insurrec
tion of Arab! been successful, the Europeans would



TABLETS OF TEL EL-AMARNA 6i
have fared in our day as the Semites fared in the days of Ramses.
The translations which follow are those of tablets
which I have copied at Cairo. I have selected for
the most part the despatches which were sent from
Southern Palestine. The originals are all preserved
in the Museum of Boulaq, with the exception of No.
Ill, which was in the possession of M. Urbain
Bouriant, the director of the French Archaeological
School in Cairo, at the time I copied it. Translitera
tions of the texts, with notes, will appear in a paper
of mine on " The tablets of Tel el-Amarna now in
Egypt"; a general account of the tablets at Boulaq and
in Berlin will be found in Dr. Hugo Winckler's Bericht
iieber die Thontafeln von Tell- el-Amarna, in the
Sitzungsberichte der koniglich preussischen Akademie
der Wissenschaften zu Berlin, No. 5 i, December 1888. It may be added that Amenophis III and his son Amenophis IV Khu-en-Aten are addressed in the
tablets by thoir: prcsnomina, Nimmuriya and Nimutriya
corresponding to the name read Ma-nib-ri by Pro
fessor Maspero, Napkhurururiya to Nofir-khopiru-ri.
Napkhurururiya is also found abbreviated into
Khuri(ya), which explains why in the Greek lists
Oros occupies the place of Khu-en-Aten.

1 This seems to be the meaning of the words Gin-ti-Ki-ir-mi-il-a-ki. But the first ki may be the determinative affix of locality, in which case we should have to read Gath-Irmila. The difficulty here is the strange name Irmila. It may, however, be compared with that of Jarmuth, now Yarmlt (Josh. X. 3, etc.) ^ Amili Khabiri. The Khabiri or "confederates" are spoken of in the tablet next translated (line 13), where they are described as bordering
upon Rabbah and Keilah. The word occurs in K 890, lines 4 and 8, in
the sense of "companions" iisiu pan khahiri-ya iptar'sanni, "from the
face of my companions he has separated me " ). Its use in these despatches as the name of a body of men who possessed territory in the south of Palestine is very interesting, as it throws light on the origin of the name of Hebron, and explains why the name is not met with in the Egyptian lists of the Palestinian cities. Khebron (Hebron), in fact, denoted the "Con
federacy" of tribes who met at the great sanctuary of Kirjath-Arba, the termination (-o«) being that which, as in Jeshurun or Zebulon or Simeon, distinguished territorial names. In the list of Palestinian cities given by Thothmes III at Karnak the place of Hebron seems to be taken by Ya^qab-el, "Jacob is El" or "god." 3 " Moloch is Ar'il." Ar'il is the Arfil or " hero " of the Moabite Stone of the Old Testament (Isaiah xxxiii. 7) which appears as Ariel in 2 Sam.
xxiii. 20, and Isaiah xxix. 1, ^, who applies the term to Jerusalem. Like the writer of the despatch, Isaiah considered the word to be a compound
of ^/ or il, " God." * Qarti-k). The Kirjath meant is probably either Kirjath-Arba
(Hebron) or Kirjath-Sepher. But it may be Kirjath-Baal (Josh. xv. 60). " Written Ururusi in the next despatch (Une 15). I cannot identify the town. Khapi.

THE ASSYRIAN CHRONOLOGICAL CANON
By the Editor
Chronological records were kept in Assyria by
the help of certain officers called limmi, who corre
sponded to the eponymous archons of Greek history.
At the beginning of each year a limmu or eponym
was appointed, who gave his name to the year. In
the age of the first Assyrian Empire it was customary
for the king to commence his reign by taking the
office ; later, the year in which the king became
eponym was regulated by no fixed rule. Shal
maneser II held the office twice during his long reign
of thirty-five years — once in the first year of his
reign and again in his thirtieth year. Otherwise
there is no example of the same king being twice eponym. The system was of ancient origin. An
inscription of Rimmon-nirari I, the great-grandson
of Assur-yuballidh and the father of Shalmaneser I,
is dated in the eponymy of a certain Shalmaneser
who may have been his son. The date of Shalmaneser I is approximately determined by an
inscription engraved on a seal belonging to his son



THE ASSYRIAN CANON
Tiglath-Uras I. The seal had been carried away to
Babylon and there recovered by Sennacherib " 600
years " afterwards, so that its deportation must have
taken place about B.C. 1290. Whether it was carried
away during the reign of Tiglath-Uras or after his
death, we cannot say ; in any case Shalmaneser
who, it may be added, was the builder of the city of
Calah—would have lived before the close of the
fourteenth century B.C.
Lists of eponyms drawn up in their chronological
order were carefully kept, as well as other lists in
which notice was taken of the principal events
occurring during their term of office. Fragmentary
copies of these lists have been preserved, thus en
abling us to restore the chronology of the Assyrian
Empire during the most important period of its ex
istence. The copies were first brought to light by
Sir Henry Rawlinson, who gave them the name of
the Assyrian Canon, and pointed out their character
and bearing on the vexed questions of chronology
in the pages of the Athenceiim (1862). Four of the
copies have been published in the Cuneiform Inscrip
tions of Western Asia, vol. ii. pll. 52, 68, 69; and
vol. iii. pi. I. None of them is complete, but a com
parison of the several texts supplies their individual
deficiencies, and allows us to compile a continuous
Assyrian chronology from B.C. 893, or 909 (if we
accept Mr. George Smith's restoration), to B.C. 659.
Two fixed dates are given within this period by the
capture of Samaria B.C. 722, which took place in the



RECORDS OF THE PAST
first year of the reign of Sargon, and the solar edipse
of the 15th of June B.C. 763, which occurred in the
ninth year of the reign of Assur-dan III. A Hne
drawn across the tablet marks the commencement
of a new reign.
An exhaustive account of the Canon has been
given by George Smith in his Assyrian Eponym
Canon (Bagster and Sons), and a translation of it,
with dates and notes attached, will be found in Prof
Schrader's Cuneiform Inscriptions and the Old Testa
ment, vol. ii. (English translation 1888); and Keil
inschriftliche Bibliothek,vo\.\. (1889). Supplement
ary copies of the Canon from fragments in the British
Museum have also been published by Prof Fr.
Delitzsch in the second edition of his Assyrische
LesestUcke, and by Dr. Bezold in the Proceedings of
the Society of Biblical ArchcBology for May 1889.
Two different versions of the Canon were current
in Assyria, one containing merely a list of the
eponyms in their chronological order, while the other
added their titles and the principal events which dis
tinguished their term of office. We may call the
latter the Assyrian Chronicle.

THE STANDARD INSCRIPTION OF ASSUR-NATSIR-PAL
By the Editor
This long inscription of Assur-natsir-pal, inscribed
in various forms across the bas-reliefs of his palace,
ranks next in geographical importance to the annals
of Tiglath-Pileser I. Assur-natsir-pal reigned from
B.C. 883 to B.C. 858, more than 200 years after his
illustrious predecessor. But this interval of 200 years
was almost a blank in the history of Assyria. It
witnessed the rise of no great king or conqueror
indeed it would seem that the feeble successors of
Tiglath-Pileser lost territory rather than gained it.
With Assur-natsir-pal, however, a new era commenced.
Once more the armies of Nineveh went forth to
conquer, and once more it was towards the north and
the west that their marches were usually directed.
The Armenian kingdoms on the north, Carchemish
and Syria to the west, were the main objects of attack.
Tiglath-Pileser had been unable to penetrate be
yond the Hittite fortress of Carchemish, and force the
fords of the Euphrates v/hich it protected. If he
made his way further to the west it was along the



THE INSCRIPTION OF ASSUR-NATSIR-PAL 129
northern range of mountains which led him into
Kilikia or to the fertile plain of Malatiyeh. But
Assur-natsir-pal was attended with better fortune.
The merchant princes of Carchemish had in his day
lost their ancient prowess and military spirit, and they
were glad to buy off the threatened attack of the
Assyrians with a rich bribe. Assur-natsir-pal left
Carchemish in his rear and pressed onward towards
Phoenicia and the Mediterranean coast. In the time
of his son and successor Shalmaneser II, Assyria
has already entered within the horizon of the western
nations, and has come into contact, not only with
the kings of Damascus, but with the kings of Israel
as well.
The annals of Assur-natsir-pal present us with an
invaluable picture of Western Asia in the ninth
century before our era, before Assyrian conquest had
as yet changed the political map of the country. It
is interesting to compare it with the picture presented
by the annals of Tiglath-Pileser two centuries earlier.
It is chiefly in the Armenian highlands that a change
has taken place, or, it may be, is in process of taking
place. The land of Nahri or " the rivers " of Tiglath
Pileser has shifted its position and has passed from
the districts at the sources of the Tigris and Euphrates
to the southern shores of Lake Van.^ The rise of the
kingdom of Ararat or Van, which was destined to
play a considerable part in the future history of
Western Asia, was, it would appear, the immediate
' See the Records of the Past, new series, vol. i. p. 106, note 7.
VOL. II K



130 RECORDS OF THE PAST
consequence of the campaigns of Assur-natsir-pal in
the north. The cuneiform inscriptions of Armenia
begin with Sari-duris I, the antagonist of Shalmaneser
II, the son and successor of Assur-natsir-pal, and are
not only written in the syllabary of Nineveh, but are
modelled on the inscriptions of the Assyrian king.
As the city of Dhuspas or Van was founded by Sari
duris, while his father Lutipri is never given the title
of king, it is probable that he was the founder of a
new dynasty as well as of a new kingdom. At all
events Arrame, who appears in the annals of Shal
maneser as the predecessor of Sari-duris, had his
capital at Arzaskun, to the west of Lake Van and at
a long distance from what was afterwards the central
point of the kingdom of Ararat. The wars of Assur
natsir-pal and Shalmaneser not only introduced
Assyrian civilisation into the north, but also resulted
in the union of a number of small principalities into
a single monarchy, which, under the varying names
of Ararat and Armenia, long continued to fill an
important place in Asiatic history.
On the whole, however, when the veil which lies
for two centuries over the map of Western Asia is
lifted, we see that few changes have taken place in it.
On the east the Kurdish mountains are still held by
wild and independent tribes, who form a barrier
between the inhabitants of the valley of the Tigris
and the Aryan popialation of Media. South of them
comes the ancient and cultured kingdom of Elam,
stretching from its capital of Susa to the shores of



THE INSCRIPTION OF ASSUR-NATSIR-PAL 131
the Persian Gulf. The valley of the Euphrates is
occupied by the Babylonian monarchy, whose history
and civilisation mount back into the night of time,
and whose armies had penetrated to the shores of the
Mediterranean, and even to the distant island of
Cyprus, ages before the very name of Assyria had been
known. The western bank of the Euphrates is the
home of the Bedouin 'Sukhi or Shuhites, who extend
from the vicinity of Carchemish to the frontiers of
Babylonia ; and the intervening district of Mesopotamia
is filled with flourishing cities, each governed by a
prince who claims jurisdiction over a small tract of
surrounding country. They all belong to the Semitic
family, and to the north press hard upon the Hittites,
who are already in full retreat towards their old
homes in the Taurus mountains. Carchemish, how
ever, now Jerablus, with its command of the caravan
trade from east to west, is still in their hands.
Westward of them are the Patinians, a tribe of
Hittite origin, whose territory stretches from Khazaz
(now Azaz), near Aleppo, across the Afrin to Mount
Amanus, with its forests of cedars, and to the shores
of the Gulf of Antioch. But south of the Patinians
we are again among the Semites. The sea coast is
held by the wealthy trading cities of the Phoenicians,
foremost among them being Arvad and Gebal, Sidon
and Tyre ; while Syria proper is divided into two
kingdoms, that of Hamath, which has ceased to be
Hittite, and that of Damascus. Damascus had risen
upon the ruins of David's empire, which for a brief



132 RECORDS OF THE PAST
space had extended from the Gulf of Aqabah to the
banks of the Euphrates. With Damascus, Samaria
was brought into close relation, sometimes friendly,
but more usually hostile. Its first mention on the
Assyrian monuments, however, is in connection with
the battle of Qarqar in B.C. 853, when "Ahab of
Israel " sent a contingent to the help of Hadadezer
or Ben-hadad against his Assyrian assailants.
The wars of Assur-natsir-pal, like most of those of
the first Assyrian empire, did not lead to permanent
conquest or annexation. They were little more than
raids, carried on partly for the sake of plunder, partly
in order to exalt the glory and power of the great
god Assur, partly to open a road to the west for the
merchants of Nineveh. It is possible also that the
wars against the hardy mountaineers of Kurdistan or
Armenia were intended to prevent the latter from
descending into the fields of Assyria and disturbing
their more peaceful neighbours. It was not until the
rise of the second Assyrian empire, until the age
of Tiglath-Pileser III, of Sargon and of Sennacherib,
that Assyrian conquest meant absorption into a single
great organised power.
Assur-natsir-pal, whose name signifies "Assur has
defended the son," was the son and successor of
Tiglath-Uras II, and was himself succeeded by his
son Shalmaneser after a reign of twenty-five years.
His "Standard Inscription" proved of high value in
the early days of cuneiform decipherment, on account
of the numerous variants presented by the different



THE INSCRIPTION OF ASSUR-NATSIR-PAL 133
copies of it which we possess. It has been partly
published in Layard's Inscriptions in the Cuneiform
Character, pll. i-ii, and more fully and accurately in
the Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia, vol. i.
pll. 17-26.
The translation of it given in the first series of
Records of the Past (vol. iii. pp. 37-80) belongs to the
earlier days of Assyrian study, and it has therefore
become necessary to replace it by one more accurate
and trustworthy. Not only is it now possible to
identify the chief localities mentioned in the text, but
the progress of Assyrian philology has also made it
possible to translate the text with a precision which
fifteen years ago was unattainable. Like most of the
historical inscriptions, it now oiifers but few words the
rendering of which is doubtful. And its geographical
importance and historical interest alike make it
desirable that the student who is not an Assyriologist
should possess the text in a trustworthy form. A
translation of the introductory lines has been published
by Lhotzky, Die Annalen AssurnazirpaVs (Munich,
1884), and the whole inscription has been translated
by Dr. Peiser in Schrader's Keilinschriftliche Biblio
thek (1889), vol. i. pp. 51-129.

Temples were built after the supposed likeness of this "temple of the earth," and the name consequently came to signify a "temple" in general. Uras was the messenger of Mul-hl "the lord of the ghost-world," worshipped at Nipur or Niffer, and identified by the Semites with their supreme Bel. His connection with the ghost-world or Hades explains why Uras should be called " the offspring of the temple of the earth."

my heart and the stretching forth of my hand Istar,i the lady who loves 38. my high-priesthood, looked with favour upon me and set her heart to make combat and battle, and in those days Assur-natsir-pal, the exalted prince, the worshipper of the great gods, 39. whom Bel has caused to obtain the desire of his heart so that his hand conquered the lands of all princes who submitted not unto him, the conqueror 40. of his foes who in difficult places has broken through the

To effect the submission and homage of countries and mighty mountains powerfully has he urged me. In reliance on Assur my lord 43. I traversed impassable paths (and) trackless mountains

Whether the country of Gozan had anything to do with the city of Gozan which gave its name to Gauzanitis in classical times is doubtful. The city seems to be meant by the Gozan of Scripture (2 Kings xix. 12) which lay on the river Khabour. Khupuska lay to the north of Assyria and the Upper Zab.

SPECIMENS OF ASSYRIAN CORRESPONDENCE
By Theo. G. Pinches.
There is probably no branch of Assyro-Babylonian
literature that is more attractive than the correspond
ence. Not only do the letters which have been found
in the ancient record-offices of Assyria and Babylonia
furnish the student with specimens of the modes of
thought and expression of the ordinary people, and
enable him to see in what consisted their communi
cations, what were their intrigues, their joys, and their
sorrows ; but they also furnish him with valuable side
lights upon the history, religion, manners, customs, and
last, not least, important philological information
the peculiar idioms and pronunciation of different
districts, the varieties of style of the diff"erent scribes.
The National Collection contains several hundred
tablets bearing inscriptions of this class, addressed to
and from various persons in different parts of the
Assyrian empire, implying a very perfect system of
communication between Nineveh, the capital, and the
outlying districts. The subjects treated of vary from
simple greetings to descriptions of hostile demonstra



ASSYRIAN CORRESPONDENCE 179
tions, congratulations, claims upon the royal clemency,
answers to astrological, philological, and other ques
tions, medical and other reports, proclamations, etc.
etc. These letters are generally oblong tablets of
baked clay, across which the lines of writing are in
scribed the narrow way. It is not unlikely that many
of the documents of this class which have come down
to us are copies, the originals having been sent away
from Nineveh. Papyrus was probably used for these
documents, but clay letters were also sent about.
These latter sometimes (had an envelope of clay around
them, addressed and sealed with the sender's cylinder.
The number of dated letters is very small in com
parison with those without dates, so that we can only
arrive at an idea as to when they were written by in
ternal evidence, such as names, places, and historical
events. The precise dates of many of them, however,
must always remain uncertain.
These documents vary in length from one to six
inches, and in width from three-quarters of an inch
to about two inches and a half. The present texts
are of sizes about midway between these two ex
tremes.

This text is a letter from Arad-Nana, who seems

deed, so ill was he, that the writer did not expect that
he would live more than seven or eight days longer
(see the last sentence of the translation). One ray of
comfort only does the writer hold out, and that is,
that the sufferer might recover, if the king would only
cause prayer to be made to his gods.
Judging from the text, it is hardly likely that the
sickness from which the man was suffering was a
natural one. He had doubtless received a wound or
injury—perhaps several—and it was very probable
that one of these, which he had received in his head,
would prove mortal.
The number of the tablet is S 1064.
Translation
To the king my lord, thy servant Arad-Nana. May
there be peace for ever and ever to the king my lord. May the god NiNEP '^ and the goddess Gula give soundness of
heart and soundness of flesh to the king my lord. Peace
for ever. To reduce the general inflammation of his forehead,^ I have tied a bandage upon it. His face is swollen.^ Yesterday, as formerly, I opened the wound which had been received in the midst of it. As for the bandage which was over the swelling, matter was upon the bandage, the
size of the tip of the little finger. Thy gods, if the whole of the flesh of his body they can restore unto him, cause thou to invoke, and his mouth will cry * : " Peace for ever. May the heart of the king my lord be good."

He will live seven or eight days.^
The text of v^^hich the translation is given above
forms one of a number published by the Rev. S. A.
Smith in his book Die Keilschrifttexte Asiirbanipals,
Heft II (the 17th plate), to which publication I con
tributed a German rendering, with philological notes.^
The translation here given diiifers slightly from that
which I published in S. A. Smith's Keilschrifttexte.
The alterations are two in number, the first being in
the eleventh line of the original, where, instead of
reading sa kiiri ina-stc, " which is around his eyes," I
now read sa kutal ma-sic, " of the wall of his eyes,"
most likely meaning his "brows," or "forehead;"^
the other change is in the nineteenth and twentieth
lines of the original text, where, instead of regarding
zitidi as a verb, with the meaning of " I raised," "took
off" (" I took off the bandage which was around it "),
I now take it to be a noun with the meaning of
" swelling." Though the sense of the whole is pretty
clear, the translation will probably be still further im
proved as time goes on.
Other tablets of this class exist, and one of them,
^ I give here a transcription of tlie original text for tlie use of students: '* Ana sarri belta, arad-ka Arad-Nana. Lusulmu addannis addannis ana sarri belia ; Ninep u Gula dhub libbi, dhub sSre, ana sarri belia liddinu. . Sulmu addannis.

K 519, is of great interest in connection with the text
above translated. This other text is also from Arad
Nana, and probably refers to the same sick man, who
seems to have been the king's son. " Concerning the
sick man," Arad-Nana says, "from whose face blood
flows, the Rab-mugi (Rab-mag .'')^ has said thus:
'Yesterday, as before, much (.') blood flowed.' He
took off those bandages {lippi Antmute) with care.^
Upon the wounds (.') of his face it was inflamed (J).
The injuries are improving. Before the blood ^ flows,
let him make the opening of the nostril *—the breath ^
will come through, the blood will stop." A few more
lines end the communication. This document, which
is exceedingly interesting, is rather defaced here and
there, thus greatly adding to the difficulties of a
naturally difficult text. The important point about
it is that, besides the interesting words that it con
tains, it gives the record of what may be called a
surgical operation. Whether this communication pre
ceded, in order of time, the text of which the full
translation is given above, is doubtful ; though, taking
into consideration the hopeful tone of K 519, and the
despairing tone of S 1064, the precedence of the
former is exceedingly probable.
' [This is an important identification. For the Rab-mag see Jer. xxxix. 3, Ed.'\ ' Or "skill" (lamudanute, from the root IB?. Cf. Heb. Tisb, '' expert"). ^ It must here be remarked, that the word " blood " (d^mu) is always used, as in Hebrew, in the plural. The phrase in the original is " before the bloods have flowed " [ultit fani ddme uts^ni).

111 the introduction it will be noticed that Ninep
and Gula are invoked. The former, as a star, was
sometimes named Nin-azii, " the lord physician."
His more usual title, however, is " the warrior," and he
is also named " lord of the weapon " {del kakki),
though the text which gives him this title invokes
him to "remove the sickness."^ The "warrior," able to
cause wounds, was supposed to be able also to remove
them. Gula, " the great lady," who is also called " the
lady of Isin " or Karrag, was the consort of Ninep,
especially under his name of Utu-gisgallu. Another
of her names (like those already mentioned, Akkadian)
is Nin-tin-badaga, " the lady giving life to the dead."
Nebuchadnezzar speaks of her as the preserver and
perfecter of his life (edhirat, gamilat nabistid). In
another text, where she is named Nin-Karrag (" lady
of Karrag "), she is spoken of as " the physician, high
and great," and invoked to " take far away the grief
of his (the sick man's) body." In this text her name
occurs between Istar and Bau, who are apparently
other forms of the same goddess.^

tributed to the same work (p. 86), a " free " transla
tion in English, which does not essentially differ from
that given above. These translations are much better
than that which I gave at first, the improvements
being due to the advances which have been made in
the science of Assyriology since that was published.
The principal difference in the translation occurs
in the second part, this difference being caused by
translating the word nikhidkuni by '' we missed,"
instead of " sinned " or " transgressed." It is unlikely
that a man would voluntarily accuse himself of being
a thief, hence this rendering. The meaning of " to
miss," however, attached to this root, occurs in
Hebrew, Job v. 24, " thou shalt visit thy fold and shalt
miss nothing," ^ so that the meaning here proposed
for the word may be regarded as quite certain.

The third text which I give is a translation of a

some rumour which had reached him, anent certain
seditious words uttered by a man whom he does not
name, but whom he speaks of as " the wind " {sdru),
and farther on as "the lord of slander" {bel-dababi)}
Apparently the Assyrian king wished it to be thought
that he considered this man's exhortations as simply
" vain, empty words," and the man himself as beneath
his notice ; but the letter itself indicates that he really
thought both the man and his message to be of suffi
cient importance to counteract if he could. He
therefore exhorts the Babylonians, in fairly vigorous
terms, to pay no attention to " the lord of slander,"
and he warns them that they are responsible for the
payment of the tribute due to Assyria, which they
seemed inclined to pervert to the use of the enemy
of the Assyrian king, or at least to raise as much for
his use until they could, with his help, throw off the
Assyrian yoke. Hence the king's anger, and his
impatience for a reply to his exhortation. The text
is made the more interesting by the fact that it not
only gives the name of the eponym during whose
term of office it was written, but the name of the
person by whom it was sent as well. The number of
the text is K 84.

RECORDS OF THE PAST
There are several similar proclamations to this,
but probably none of them are in such a perfect state
of preservation, though most of them are more in
teresting, because they give more precise historical
indications by mentioning the names of the persons
to whom they refer.
The text itself contains several interesting lin
guistic peculiarities. In addition to the expressions
already noted, the following may prove to be of
interest to the student : raimani-su, " his own," for
ramani-su—probably pointing to a peculiarity of
pronunciation ; ^ sun-kimu for sumkumi, " your name "
(change of m into ii before k—not uncommon in
Assyrian) ; kutsistifaktmu for kutstsupatunu, " ye are
treasuring up "—a most important variant form ; the
interesting phrases j/dnu sii ki . . . " it is not that
..
. ", and s^ kt . . . " it is that . . . " ; and the use
of the demonstratives dgd and Aganute.
It is noteworthy, also, that in two passages the
king speaks of God (Ilu), not of " the gods " («J
raman-kunu, ina pan Hi la tukhadhdha, " and commit
not, yourselves, a sin before God ; " u khadhdhu ina

these words, the One-God idea was uppermost in his
mind. This was, probably, the result of a feeling
inherited from the time when monotheism, more or
less pure, was the possession of the Semitic race, or
at least that portion of it to which the Semitic Baby
lonians or Assyrians and the Israelites belonged.^

this interesting document is about 650 B.C.
^ This question, which admits of a much fuller treatment and discussion than can be given to it here, is intimately bound up with the original significance and use of the divine names Jah and Jahveh (Jehovah).



AKKADIAN HYMN TO THE SETTING SUN
Translated by G. Bertin.
The following hymn is interesting because it appears
to have formed part of the Babylonian ritual. In
each temple, at certain hours of the day and night,
priests devoted to this office had to recite certain
prayers or incantations. We possess in the British
Museum (Table case A, Nos. 4 and 4a) two copies of
this hymn. The first one is no doubt the temple copy,
and the colophon gives the time at which it is to be
repeated by the priest. The other tablet is what
might be called an ex-voto copy. When ill, the Baby
lonians, as the Christians of the middle ages, made
certain promises to the gods in case of recovery ; the
fulfilment of the vow was generally a tablet which was
to be placed in the temple. The same custom pre
vailed also in Greece, but in Babylonia, literature being
the most highly-prized branch of the Fine Arts, the
ex-voto was as a rule the copy of an old tablet.
This hymn appears to have been composed in
Akkadian, the religious language of Babylon, but
is given with an interlinear translation in Assyro



HYMN TO THE SETTING SUN 191
Babylonian ; the translation sometimes offers slight
divergences from the original text, which have been
noticed in the notes.
A point to be observed is that the moon, who was
generally considered as a male god, is here regarded
as a goddess consort of the Sun-god. In the ex-voto
copy she is called the sister of the Sun. We might
conclude from this variant that the Moon, in the
Babylonian as in the Egyptian mythology, was sister
and wife of the Sun.
Throughout the hymn there seems to be a certain
Semitic or Hamitic rather than Akkadian under
current of thought.
Both copies are written in the later Babylonian
style of writing, and date probably from the reign of
Nebuchadnezzar the Great. The text has been pub
lished, with a French translation and notes by myself,
in the Revue d'Assyriologie, vol. i. part iv.



HYMN TO THE SETTING SUN
O Sun, in the middle of the sky, at thy setting, may the bright gates welcome thee favourably,^ may the door of heaven be docile to thee. May the god director,^ thy faithful messenger, mark the way! In E-BARA,^ seat of thy royalty, he makes thy greatness shine forth. May the Moon, thy beloved spouse,* come to meet thee with joy.^ May thy heart rest in peace. May the glory of thy godhead remain with thee. Powerful hero, O Sun ! shine gloriously.^ Lord of E-BARA, direct in thy road thy foot rightly. O Sun, in making thy way, take the path marked for thy rays ! Thou art the lord of judgments over all nations.
Colophon of the Temple Copy
This is the hymn to the setting sun, the incantator ' says it after the beginning of the night.
1 The Assyrian version has " speali of peace to thee." ' This is the god who wallied in front of the Sun, the forerunner. 3 E-bara is the name of the temple of the Sun-god. * One of the two copies says "thy beloved sister; ' the Moon was considered sometimes as wife, sometimes as sister of the Sun, as perhaps being both.
" The Assyrian has " go in front of thee." ^ The Assyrian has " glorify thyself" ' This is the name of a class of priests, whose functions were to repeat certain prayers or incantations at certain hoiu'S.

Nabu-balatsu-ikbi, son of E-sagilian, for the preservation of his life has had this tablet written for Nebo, his lord, by Nabu-epis-akhi, son of E-sagilian, and placed it in the temple E-ZIDA.
^ When tablets formed a series, each one always gave at the end the first line of the next tablet of the series. In this case the line is important, because, as the hymn to the setting sun is given iirst, it shows that the Babylonians, like the Jews, placed the night first.
VOL. II O



THE MOABITE STONE
Translated by Dr. A. Neubauer
The Moabite stone was discovered by the Rev.
F. Klein, on the site of Dibon (now Dhiban), on the
19th of August 1868. When on his way to the
Bekka his attention was drawn by a friendly sheikh
to a black basalt stone in the vicinity of his tent.
This stone, about 3 ft. 10 in. high, 2 ft. in breadth, and
14I in. in thickness, and rounded both at the top and
the bottom to nearly the shape of a semicircle, con
tained an inscription on one side consisting of thirty
four lines. The discoverer, although he did not
immediately recognise the importance of his find, had
good sense enough to try to acquire it for the museum
at Berlin. As soon as the natives learned that the
infidels were in search of the monument, they began
to interest all persons they could get hold of in it.
Captain Warren (of the Palestine Exploration Fund)
was informed of its existence some weeks after Klein's
discovery, but knowing that the Berlin Museum was
already concerned in the matter, he took no steps
towards its acquisition till 1869. However, whilst
the negotiations of the Prussian Government were



THE MOABITE STONE 195
making only slow progress, everything in the East
moving but slowly, M. Clermont-Ganneau, then drago
man of the French Consulate in Jerusalem, wisely
took at once the necessary steps for procuring squeezes
and copies of the inscription, and finally endeavoured
to buy the monument itself. Fortunately he was
successful in his attempt to obtain a squeeze of the
inscription while the stone was still in its entirety, for
it soon became too late. After the Turkish authori
ties had begun to interfere, the Bedouins of the
country of Dhiban, rather than give up the monu
ment for the benefit of the Pasha and Mddir, broke
the stone by first making a fire under it, and then
pouring cold water on it, and subsequently distributed
the pieces among themselves to be used as amulets
and charms. Thus, through the zeal of those who
acted in the name of two European countries, one of
the earliest Semitic monuments written in alphabetical
characters was irretrievably ruined.
For a detailed history of the vicissitudes under
gone by the stone, I must refer to Dr. Ginsburg's
second edition of his work on the Moabite inscription,
and to M. H^ron de Villefosse's notice (see full
title below, p. 196), who does not, however, even
mention the name of Klein. Happily more than half
of the inscription remained intact, and M. Clermont
Ganneau's squeezes and copies supply in large
measure the lacunae in the text, as may be seen from
an inspection of the original monument, which now
adorns the museum of the Louvre. It stands there

in its original shape, the lacunse being suppHed from
the squeezes and copies. And from this monument,
as reproduced in 1886 by Professors Rudolf Smend
and Albert Socin, I shall give the translation which
follows.
It would be superfluous to mention in detail all
the literature that bears upon the stone. The reader
will find it given up to. 1875 in M. Heron de Ville
fosse's monograph under the title of Notice des
monuments frovenant de la Palestine, Paris, 1876,
arranged according to the countries to which the
authors belong. It is seldom that such a number
of names can be found contributing to a subject of
Oriental study, as was the case with the Moabite
inscription. I shall mention them in alphabetical
order, the names being taken from M. H^ron de
Villefosse's work. They are—Auerbach (J.) ; Bal
lagi; Beke (D.) ; Bensly ; Bonelly ; Burton (A. F.
and Ch.) ; *Clermont-Ganneau ; Colenso (Bishop)
Derenbourg (J.) ; Deutsch (E.) ; Fabiani ; Geiger
(A.) ; *Ginsburg (Ch. D.) ; Goldziher ; Grove (G.) Hal^vy (Abraham) ; Harkavy ; Haug ; Hayes Ward
*Heron de Villefosse ; Himpel ; *Hitzig ; Howard

(S.) ; *Schlottmann ; Schrader (E.) ; Schroeder
Smend ; Socin ; Testa ; *Vogu^ (Comte de) ; Warren
(Sir Ch.) ; Weier ; Wright (W.). The names to which



THE MOABITE STONE 197
an asterisk is prefixed are those of authors who have
published separate works on the subject ; the contri
butions of the others are scattered through periodicals
and daily and weekly papers, in many languages,
viz., English, French, Italian, German, Hebrew, and
Greek (Schroeder). I shall not supply here the titles
of the periodicals nor of the separate monographs;
this I hope will be done either by M. ClermontGanneau when he gives us his final commentary on
the inscription, or in a second edition of the pamphlet
published by Professors Smend and Socin.
Our bibliographical list will not be complete
without a notice of the Rev. A. Lowy's article on
" The apocryphal character of the Moabite Stone " in
the Scottish Review for April 1887. Mr. Lowy's
article was ingenious, but, as was pointed out in the
Athencsum, AcadeTiiy, and Guardian, was destitute of
palaeographical support, and his conclusions have not
been accepted by any other Semitic scholar.
M. Clermont-Ganneau promised as far back as
1875 a final publication of this important inscription
according to all the materials at his disposal. But of
this edition nothing exists except a bookseller's adver
tisement. In a catalogue of M. Ernest Leroux, 1878,
M. Clermont-Ganneau's final publication was an
nounced under the following title :—" La stele de
Mdsa, roi de Moab (ix^ siecle avant J. C). Edi
tion definitive, avec les photographies du monument
et de I'estampage, le plan du pays ou la st^le fut
decouverte, plusieurs planches d'inscriptions, fac



igS RECORDS OF THE PAST
simile, vignette, etc. (sous presse), 20 fr." Up to the
present date nothing more has been heard of this
authoritative edition.
In 1885 two German professors, Dr. Rudolf
Smend of Bale and Dr. Albert Socin of Tubingen,
seeing that the long-expected edition of M. Clermont
Ganneau had been postponed indefinitely, and feeling
the necessity of such an edition for the purposes of
instruction in the university, decided to make one
with the help of the original in the Louvre, and
of the squeeze made by the Arab for M. Clermont
Ganneau, as well as of another squeeze in the library
of Bale. The edition, which is the result of hard,
minute, and skilful labour on the part of the two
professors, is now the final and authoritative edition
of the inscription, although contested on many points
by M. Clermont-Ganneau in an article (not always
impartially written) in the Journal Asiatique for 1887,
t6me ix. p. 72 sqq., and by M. Renan in the Journal
des Sava7its, 1887. In my translation I shall notice
the differences between M. Clermont-Ganneau's read
ings and those of the two professors, adding a few
remarks of my own.
Let me say at once that the last four lines of the
inscription are hopelessly inexplicable owing to the
lacunae found in them.
The object of the inscription is to commemorate
the victory of Mesha over his Israelitish enemy. Chemosh was once angry with Moab and caused
them to lose territory and even to be conquered by



THE MOABITE STONE 199
Israel. Chemosh then showed favour to his nation
and Moab was victorious. The Moabites not only
recaptured the towns they had lost, but added others
to them which they took from Israel. Mesha cap
tured the priests (?) of the god or goddess Dodo and
Jahweh, and hewed them in pieces before Chemosh, just as Samuel hewed Agag before Jahweh. Mesha
took great pains to construct cisterns in some of the
towns belonging to Moab. The Moabite dialect is
tinged with non-biblical words and forms, but the
construction remains biblical. The characters are
Phoenician, and form a link between those of the
Baal Lebanon inscription (of the tenth century B.C.),
and those of the Siloam text.

' Most likely a district of Dibon, perhaps alluded to in Isaiah xv. ii. ^ Smend-Socin read p?Dn "the Kings," which would presuppose an allied force, of which there is no further question in the inscription, nor does the Bible mention that Mesha was assisted in his revolt by allies. The D is according to M. Clermont-Ganneau doubtful. The following restorations are possible: ist, p^tJTI "freebooters." Comp. ^ptJ" Lev. xi. 18, A.V. "pelican," or identical with inl'tJ'n, "swordsmen." 2d, pbnn " the misfortunes " or "misery," Comp. Ps. x. 8. " The reading "IDIO by S.S. is not idiomatic ; -ntS would do better.

' A city in Gad (Numb, xxxii. 3). ^ Arel or Ariel in 2 Sam. xxiii. 20 means no doubt heroes where the A.V. has "he slew two lionlike men of Moab;" and the R.V., "he slew the two sons of Ariel of Moab." Perhaps it was a dialectic word peculiar to the trans-Jordanic country ; we find a son of Gad with the name of Areli (Gen. xlvi. 16 ; Numb. xxvi. 17). It is used also in
Isaiah xxxiii. 7, A.V. and R.V., " their valiant ones" (the Hebrew being Erelam, perhaps better .£?-«&«, " valiant ones," parallel to the following expression, "the messengers of peace," or "messengers of Shalem," i.e. Jerusalem). Possibly the word iTilK (Isaiah x-v. 9; LXX. koX
'kpLT]K ; A.V. "lions upon him ;
" R.V. "a hon upon him" — Isaiah xxi.
8; LXX. Qiipiav ; A.V. "And he cried, A lion;" R.V. "and he cried as a lion;" better "the hero "or "watchman called out") should be
read Aryah, a compound of Ar and yah, analogous to Ar-el. And so perhaps in 2 Sam. xxiii. 20. Ariel is also the name of the stronghold (Zion) of David (Isaiah xxix. l, 2), and later of a part ( ? the Holy of Holies) of the Temple (Ezekiel xUii. 15, 16 ; LXX. dpi7;\ ; A.V. and R.V. altar). ' Or Dodo, perhaps connected with the Carthaginian Dido. The
persons named Dodo in the Bible are usually heroes (2 Sam. .xxiii. 9, 24) ;
thus we have Dodavahu (2 Chr. xx. 37) and Dodai (i Chr. xxvii. 4), where
Dodo is compounded with Yahu. In our inscription Dodo is parallel with Yahveh (hne 17).
w A city in Moab (Jer. xlviii. 24 ; Amos ii. 2). 11 Perhaps to be pronounced Sharon.

In his restoration only [ID and mD could give a sense, viz. " Men and
masters, women, mistresses" (where JTID would have to be derived from the form ITID). * The male divinity of Ashtoreth, which is to be found in Himyaritic inscriptions, compounded with Chemosh. s The parallelism of line 12 requires ''7N1N here.

THE ARCHAIC CLASSICS.
Assyrian Grammar. An Elementary Grammar and Reading- Book of the Assyrian Language, in the Cuneiform Character : containing the most complete Syllabary yet extant, and which will serve also as a Vocabulary of both Accadian and Assyrian. Second Edition, Revised and Corrected. By the Rev. A. H. Sayce, M.A., Deputy Professor of Comparative Philology, Oxford. 4to. Cloth, 7s. 6d.
" Mr. Sayce's new Assyrian Grammar will be of great value.'' AthetuEuvi,
" We doubt not that this book will be gladly welcomed on all sides." Academy.
Assjrrian Texts. Being Extracts from the Annals of Shalmaneser II., Sennacherib, and Assur-bani-pal. With Philological Notes by Ernest A. Budge, M. R.A.S., Assyrian Exhibitioner, Christ College, Cambridge. 4to. Cloth extra, 7s. 6d.
" Mr. Budge's book forms part of the useful series known as the ' Archaic Classics,' and consists of a reading-book intended for those who have already mastered the elements of Assyrian grammar. . . . The texts have been selected and edited with great care, variant readings being noted at the bottom of the page, and the explanatory notes at the end reflect much credit upon the author. They will be found very helpful
by the beginner. Type and paper leave nothing to be desired. We hope that this and 'the other volumes of the same series will attract an increasing number of scholars to the study of Assyrian. Its close relationship to Hebrew cannot but clear up many obscure points in Hebrew philology, since words which occur but once or twice in the Old Testament are not unfrequently of common occurrence in the Assyrian texts. . . In fact, it is no longer possible to deal with questions of Semitic philology without some knowledge at least of Assyrian. . . . But what has already been achieved in the field of Assyrian decipherment is but an earnest of what may yet he achieved in it. The harvest is abundant ; the labourers alone are wanted. Let us hope that
Mr. Budge's book will be, amongst others, the means of gathering them in."—The Guardian, August 18, 1880.

This work is not a new biography of Abraham, but gives an account of the civilised world in which he lived, from Elam on the East to Egypt on the West, drawn from the existing results of Egyptological and Assyriological research, and elucidates the true position and character of the Patriarch. Th? illustrations are chosen from an ethnographic point of view, as specimens of the leading races of the early world.
" Mr. Tomkins has produced a very vivid and truthful picture of the surroundings
of Abraham. The margin with its notes is a joy to behold. 'It will be some time before such a book can be superseded." Academy.

"The texts of Genesis scattered throughout the twelve volumes of the Talmud have been carefully searched out and arranged in the order in which we find them in
our Bibles. To each individual text is added the immediate context as found in the
Talmud. After many of the texts and the direct Talmudical comments upon them, so-called Synoptical Notes are introduced. These refer to the principal subjects suggested in the text just commented upon, and any curious and interesting remark on
these subjects contained in the Mishna and Gemara is appended. Careful references to the particular treatise, page, and column arc in all cases given." Introductory Essay.

PREFACE
>
In presenting a new volume of the Records of the
Past to the public, I feel it my duty to remind the
reader of certain words which I wrote in the Preface
to the first volume. I there said that " the writer
who wishes to make use of a translation from an
Egyptian, or Assyrian text for historical or contro
versial purposes ought to know where it is certain,
and where it is only possible, or at most probable."
I therefore promised that " in the present series of
volumes doubtful words and expressions should be
followed by a note of interrogation, the preceding
word being put into italics where necessary"; that is
to say, that the reader should be forewarned when
ever the translator was himself in doubt as to the
correctness of his rendering.
So far as lies within the power of an editor, this
promise has been fulfilled. But it must be remem
bered that in many cases a translator may consider
that the version he proposes admits of no question,
whereas another scholar may take a different view,
and hold the version to be incorrect. Such cases
occur even in translations from Latin and Gjreek



PREFACE
authors, still more so in the translation of the Old
Testament. It is impossible for all men to think
alike even in matters of philology. Gradually, no
doubt, with the progress of knowledge, approach is
made to unanimity of opinion ; but after all it is
only approach. It is only young scholars who
think themselves qualified to set all the world
right.
In the decipherment and translation of what may
be termed the monumental languages of the past

Egyptian, Assyrian, Phoenician, and the like—much
depends upon the nature of the text. Historical
texts are fortunately the simplest, and are naturally
the first to attract the notice of the decipherer. Con
sequently the historical texts of Egypt or of Assyria
can now be read with almost as much ease and cer
tainty as the historical books of the Hebrew Scrip
tures. The case is different when we come to deal
with texts of a more complicated character, and
when we recollect how uncertain is the translation of
much of the language in the non-historical books of
the Old Testament, we need not wonder that the
Egyptian or Assyrian translator should intersperse his
renderings of religious and mythological texts with
notes and queries, or should improve upon them from
time to time as his materials increase. In one
respect, however, he possesses an advantage over the
Old Testament student ; he generally has to deal
with texts which are fairly free from the corruptions
of copyists. The Assyrian translator, moreover, has



PREFACE Vll
at his disposal an enormous mass of literature, much
exceeding that contained in the Old Testament,
though it is true that but a comparatively small part
of it has as yet been examined.
Like all other branches of inductive science, the
science of decipherment is one of probabilities.
Absolute certainty is unattainable, whether we are
translating an inscription of Sennacherib or the book
of Genesis. But for all practical purposes a high
probability amounts to absolute certainty, and it is
this high probability that the decipherment of the ancient monuments of Egypt and Assyria or Baby
lonia has now attained. Scholars may dispute about
the exact meaning of certain words or phrases, as
they do in the case of the Hebrew Bible, but it is
seldom that anything of importance turns upon the
dispute, at all events so far as regards the historical
inscriptions. And in the present series of volumes
due notice is given to the reader of the occurrence of
such disputed words and phrases. When once we have settled the philological signi
fication of a historical text there begins the equally
important work of critically examining it. We have first to ask whether it is contemporaneous with the
event or events which it professes to record, and if
not, whether its authorities or its interpretation of its
authorities are trustworthy.
This is more especially the case as regards chron
ology—the skeleton and framework of history. I
do not think, therefore, that it will be out of place



PREFACE
even in a preface, to examine some of the data we
possess at present for determining the chronology of
Babylonia and Assyria. Translations of the docu
ments upon which it rests have been given in the
two previous volumes of this series.
Nothing can be more satisfactory than the chron
ology of Assyria so far as it extends. The Assyrians
were a people of business, and they carried their
business habits into their mode of reckoning time.
Each year was distinguished by the name of a par
ticular officer, the limmii or "eponym," after whom
it was called, and as the names of the eponyms were
recorded on the accession of each to office and
registers of them were kept, there was no difficulty in
determining the exact year in which an event
occurred or a new king ascended the throne.^
In Babylonia, however, the custom of counting
the years by eponyms does not seem to have existed,
at all events in early times. From the era of Na
bonassar (B.C. 747) downwards Babylonian chronology was fixed by means of astronomy ; before that
period it appears to have been determined by the
reigns of the kings and the duration of dynasties. In legal documents of the time of Khammuragas (or
Khammurabi) deeds are not even dated by the regnal
years of the sovereign, but by such occurrences as a
war, the construction of a canal, or the capture of a
' The etymology of the word limmu is doubtful. In the bilingual
(Assyrian and Aramaic) tablets it is written D? and DxS in the Aramaic
text. In the Kappadokian cuneiform tablets the "limnni" is frequently
named.



PREFA CE
city. Under such circumstances it is plain that
the historian who endeavoured to restore the early
chronology of Babylonia had an extremely difficult
task before him.
Our materials for reconstructing the chronology of
Babylonia are given at the beginning of the present
series of Records of the Past. I have already noted
the suspicious character of the ciphers attached to the
first dynasty of Babylon, in what may be termed the
dynastic tablet, and the discrepancy in two of our
documents between the length of reign assigned to
the kings of the dynasties of the Sea and of Bit-Bazi.
Other facts go to show that the tablet of dynasties
was drawn up by a compiler who lived at a com
paratively late date and extracted a system of chron
ology from older materials. Contemporaneous docu
ments lately discovered at Niffer prove that the true
name of Ebisum, who is made the eighth king of the
first dynasty, was really Abesukh. A seal in the
possession of Mr. R. P. Greg, belonged to a librarian
who calls himself " the servant of the king Ab^-sukh "
or "Abi-esukh," and contract-tablets make it clear
that the name is really compounded with the word
abi, " father," and has nothing to do with ebisum,
" an actor." It is questionable, moreover, whether
Khammu-ragas or Khammu-rabi—the exact reading
of the last syllable is still doubtful—was the son of
Sin-muballidh, as is stated by the author of the
Dynastic List. At all events the name he gives to
his father in one of his inscriptions seems to have



PREFACE
been different/ and the compiler of the document
which contains Assyrian translations of the names of
early Babylonian kings evidently regarded him as
of foreign origin. In this document, accordingly, he
is classed, like Ammi-sadugga,^ with Kur-galzu,
Simmas-sipak, and other Kassite princes.
From a strictly philological point of view the
classification is incorrect. The Kassite language was
non- Semitic, whereas the names of Ammi-sadugga
and Khammu-rabi are Semitic, though not Assyro
Babylonian. Along with those of Samsu-satana,
and probably also Samsu-iluna and Abi-esukh, they
belong to the Semitic dialects spoken by tribes of
Arabian descent on the western and eastern frontiers
of Babylonia. It is only geographically, therefore,
and not philologically, that the names of Khammu
rabi and Ammi-sadugga can be grouped with those
of the Kassite kings.
The Babylonians had some difficulty in pro
nouncing and writing the second element in the name of Ammi-sadugga, and in contemporaneous
inscriptions it appears under various forms, the most
correct of which is zadiiga? It represents, in fact,
the Hebrew tsadoq, and belongs to a root which is
not found in Assyrian. We now have evidence,
however, that it was known at an early date to the
Minsan language, which extended from the southern
' Ummu-banit, though Hommel would read Sin-mubanit.
2 My reading Ammi-didugga [Records of the Past, New Ser. , i. p. 32) must be thus corrected, as well as the translation of the Assyrian interpretation in which kitiu means "justice" and not " established." ^ In a contract-tablet from Niffer we even find Ammi-ziduga.



PREFACE XI
coast of Arabia to the borders of Palestine and
ChaldjEa. Among the inscriptions discovered by
M. Haldvy in the south of Arabia is one in which
mention is made of 'Ammi-tsadiqa, who was appointed
by the Minsean king, Abi-yada', governor of the
fortress of Zar on the Egyptian frontier, as well as of
the neighbouring district of Ashur (see Gen. xxv. 3).
Prof. Hommel, to whom the discovery of these facts
is due, points out that the inscription must belong to
a very early epoch indeed, probably to that of the Hyksos in Egypt. However this may be, the name
'Ammi-tsadiqa is identical with that of the Baby
lonian king Ammi-zadugga.^ The author of the
explanatory list of Babylonian royal names renders
both ammi and khaminu by the Assyrian kimtti,
" family." It is more probable that in both in
stances it is really the name of a god. Ben-Ammi
was the " father of the children of Ammon," accord
ing to Gen. xix. 38, and the Old Testament presents us with names like Ammiel, Amminadab, Balaam,
and Jeroboam, while Assur-bani-pal tells us of Am
mu-ladin, king of the Kedarites. The more correct
rendering of Numb. xxii. 5 would be " Pethor, which
is by the river (Euphrates) of the land of the children
of 'Ammo," and it is stated in a cuneiform text
{W.A. /., ii. 54. 65) that Emu—the exact equivalent
of the Hebrew 'ammo — was the name given to the
god Nergal by the Shuhites on the western banks of
1 In other Minaean inscriptions occur the names of 'Ammi-tsaduq and his son 'Ammi-karib, as well as of the king Waqah-il-tsaduq.



PREFACE
the Euphrates. The fact that in Khammu-rabi the
initial ayin of 'ammo is represented by kh, pointing
to a pronunciation with ghain, is indicative of dia
lectal differences, and implies that the dialects to which the names of Khammu-rabi and Ammi
zadugga belonged were not the same.
We may conclude, therefore, that " the first
dynasty of Babylon " had been formed out of the
reigns of kings who did not belong to the same
nationality, much less to the same family, and that
consequently the relationship assumed by the com
piler of the dynastic tablet to have existed between
them was imaginary. The first four or five kings of
the dynasty were probably local rulers of Babylon ;
Khammu-rabi, as we know, conquered the other
states of Babylonia and made it a united kingdom,
with Babylon as its centre ; it is with him, therefore,
that the first dynasty of Babylon ought properly to
commence. The earlier kings of the dynasty owe their
inclusion in it to local vanity. It is possible, how
ever, that they claimed precedence over the other
Semitic princes of Babylonia, since we know that the
power of one of them, Zabu, extended as far as
Sippara, and he may accordingly have claimed to
have been the representative of the ancient Semitic
empire of Sargon which had its seat in the close
neighbourhood of Sippara.
The relation of the Babylonian dynasties given
by the native compiler to those which have been
excerpted by George the Synkellos from the Chal



PREFACE XIH
dean history of Berossos cannot be determined at
present. It is difficult to find any agreement between
them before the time of Nabonassar. On the other
hand, the statements of Berossos have been verified
by the monuments in several important particulars.
His account of the deluge was taken from native
documents, and his history and chronology of the
period which begins with the era of Nabonassar show
a close acquaintance with the actual facts. It is of
course possible that the numbers, whether of reigns
or of years, given by the Synkellos, are corrupt and
erroneous. But even so, the scheme of dynasties
proposed by Berossos does not agree with the scheme
found on the cuneiform tablets. It is clear that
more than one system of chronology and dynastic
arrangement must have been current in Baby
lonia.
In one point, however, I think I can show that
Berossos had good authority at his back. This is the
statement that, almost at the beginning of assured
Babylonian history, Babylon was captured by
" Medes," who ruled the country for eight generations.
Now the inscriptions of Nabonidos and Kyros have
proved that the subjects of Istuvegu or Astyages,
who were called " Medes " by the Greeks, were called
" Manda " by the Babylonians. The Greeks in fact
confounded the two words Mada, " Medes," and
Manda, led thereto by the fact that both MadH and
Manda alike came from the mountains on the north
east of Babylonia. Manda, however, was not a



PREFACE
proper name in the same sense as Mada. It is
usually preceded by tsah, " soldier," and though not
Assyrian, I believe it to have had its origin among
the Semitic tribes on the eastern side of Chaldaea,
and to be related to the Hebrew nM, " to wander."
Tsab manda will therefore be the equivalent of the
Biblical erets nod or " nomad-land " (Gen. iv. 1 6).
The title is applied by Esarhaddon to Teuspa the
Kimmerian, the Gimirri or Kimmerians, the Gomer
of the Old Testament, being further distinguished
from the Mada or " Medes."
The title, however, was much older than the age
of Esarhaddon. It occurs several times in the astro
logical tablets. The most important example of its
use is in W. A. /., iii. 6i. 21, 22, where we read :
" The tsab manda comes and governs the land.
The altars of the great gods are taken away.
Bel goes to the land of Elam. It is prophesied
that after thirty years the smitten shall be re
stored (and that) the great gods shall return with
them." The same catastrophe is referred to in
another passage of the great work on astrology
(W, A. I., iii. 64. 7, 8). "The tsab manda invades
the land and rules over the country." The prophecy
is interesting on account of its analogy to the
prophecy of the restoration of the Jews after seventy
years of exile (Jer. xxv. 11). But what is equally
interesting is that while Bel, the national god of
Babylon, flies for refuge to Elam, his country is
handed over to the rule of the Manda and its altars



PREFACE
are broken down. I cannot but think that in these
Manda we ought to see the " Medes " of Berossos
who captured Babylon and founded there the first historical dynasty. They will represent Khammu
rabi, Ammi-sadugga, and the other kings whose names betray their origin among the nomad
Semites on the frontiers of Chalda;a. Berossos
was right rather than the compiler of the
dynastic tablet in making Khammu-rabi the foun
der of the dynasty under which Babylon became
for the first time the capital of a united Baby
lonia.
If the Synkellos can be trusted Berossos reckoned
eight kings to his Median dynasty. The compiler
gives Khammu-rabi only five successors. But it is
questionable whether he has collected the names
of all the kings who followed him. At all events I
possess a contract-tablet from Niffer, which belongs
to the age of Khammu-rabi and Ammi-sadugga, but
is dated in the reign of a king whose name does not
occur in the compiler's list. It reads Am(?)-mu-'SI
DI-DU-an, perhaps Ammu-e'sir-yukan. It is possible,
moreover, that classical mythology has preserved the
name of another prince of the same period. In
Ovid's Metamorphoses, iv. 212, mention is made of
the Babylonian monarch Orchamus, of whom it is
said that he was seventh in descent from Belus.
Orchamus is not an Assyro- Babylonian name. It
actually occurs, however, under the form of Yar
khamu on contract -tablets which are dated in the



PREFACE
reign of Samsu-iluna.^ Whether it is to be com
pared with the Biblical name of Jerahmeel (i Chr. ii.
25), or whether it is a mimmated form of the Minaean name of the Moon-god, I do not know ; but
its origin must be referred to the dialects of the
Arabian tribes on the borders of Babylonia, and not
to the Assyrian language itself. In any case the
name is found on documents of the time of Kham
mu-rabi, and consequently it is by no means im
possible that the myth repeated by Ovid may have
incorporated the name of a real king.
We must not forget that the passage I have
quoted from the astrological tablet associates the
invasion of Babylonia by the Manda with Ihe de
parture of the god Bel to Elam. Now about B.C.
2285, or just before the date assigned by the com
piler of the dynastic tablet to the accession of
Khammu-rabi, the goddess Nana of Erech was
carried to Elam by the Elamite king Kudur
nankhundi (see Records of the Past, New Series, i. p.
10). A mutilated text (W. A. /., iii. 38, No. 2)
couples Kudur-nankhundi with the otherwise un
known Babylonian kings [Bel ?]-sum-iddina and Bel
nadin-akhi, but it is probably a later Kudur-nan
khundi to whom reference is here made. What is
certain is that, as the contemporaneous contract

importance in the annals of the country.

THE PRECEPTS OF PTAH-HOTEP
Translated by Philippe Virey .
The most ancient book in the world, the Papyrus
Prisse, now preserved in the Biblioth^que Nationale
in Paris, has furnished us with the text of a treatise,
famous on account of its antiquity, of the glimpse that
it gives us into the moral ideas of ancient Egyptian
society, and of the difficulties it offers to the trans
lator. I have studied it perseveringly since 1881, and
have made it the subject of a philological essay, which
I presented to the Ecole des Hautes-Etudes in
1884-85 and published in 1887.^ In this I gave the
history of the manuscript, an account of the labours
of my predecessors, a transcription of the hieratic text
in hieroglyphic characters, and a translation accom
panied by numerous critical observations and an index
of the words employed in the Papyrus ; but I did not
intend to offer in it more than a purely philological
study. In spite of its dry simplicity, however, the
essay met with acceptance, and in the following year

RECORDS OF THE PAST
Mr. Howard Osgood did me the honour to publish an
English translation of it in the Bibliotheca Sacra (Oct.
1888), along with a good commentary and an
interesting comparison of the work with the Precepts
of Ani. In my turn I now undertake to present my
work under another form ; not that the translation
can be very new, since after so short a lapse of time
I could not greatly improve a work on which I have
bestowed all my thought and care^ ; but what can be
remodelled is the commentary. The philological part
of my previous publication can be reduced without
inconvenience, as the reader who wishes to study this
side of the subject can refer to my essay ; on the
other hand, the philosophical and historical portion of
the commentary will be considerably increased. I
shall utilise for this purpose some of the texts which
I copied at Thebes in 1886 in the tomb of Rekhmara,
who exercised at a later period the same functions as
Ptah-hotep.
Both were feudal lords of the Egyptian empire,
nomarchs or prefects, and were specially honoured
with the royal favour. Rekhmara^ is called hesi n
nuter nofer,^ " favourite of the good god " (Thothmes
III); Ptah-hotep, who dates his treatise in the reign
of Assa of the Fifth Dynasty, boasts at the end of it
' Of course I do not mean that I consider my translation very nearly final. - The inscriptions of the tomb of Rekhmara, prefect of Thebes under the Eighteenth Dynasty, have been published by me in the Mimoires publiis par les Mcmbres de la Mission arcUologique frartfaise au Caire ; Leroux, Paris 1889. ' Tombeau de Rekhmara, in the Mitnoires, p. 114, note 3.



THE PRECEPTS OF PTAH-HOTEP
that he had enjoyed above all others the favour of the
king, and in a text published by Lepsius {Denkmdler,
ii. 115) we read : Assa hesi Ptah-hotep, "the favourite
of Assa, Ptah-hotep."
In the preface of Ptah-hotep's treatise he even
seems to declare that he was of royal descent, for he
calls himself " the royal son, first-born, legitimate
"
(ch. v. 11. 6, 7) ; but I have elsewhere noticed that
this title must not be interpreted too literally. We
may ask why the elder and legitimate son of the king
never reigned if he lived, and Ptah-hotep did not die
young, since he was already no years old^ when he
published his work. We must attribute an extra
ordinary longevity to Assa if we hold that Ptah-hotep
was his son and died before him.
But Prof. Maspero has already shown that we
must not give too literal an interpretation to the titles
" royal mother," " royal wife," " royal daughter," and
that it was possible to be " royal wife " by right of
birth before being married. Such titles served only
to determine the rank occupied by a princess at court
in questions of etiquette and precedence.
If the appellation "royal wife" were only an
honorary title, we may infer that " royal son " also
might be the same and signify nothing more than
" prince." In this case, " the eldest legitimate son of
the king " would be equivalent to " prince of the blood
royal." That such a title can be given to a person
not belonging to the royal family is not unexampled
1 Papyrus Prisse, pi. xix. 1. 7.



RECORDS OF THE PAST
even in our own days in the West ; all the more could
it be given in the East, where the most pompous titles
are so easily accumulated. At the court of Egypt,
where everything was referred to the king, the source
of all honour, it is possible that a claim to nobility
consisted in attaching oneself, at all events nominally,
to his family, or even in making oneself part of it.
The relations of the king enjoyed the highest titles,
but even the " royal nurses " gloried in " the suckling
which had mingled their blood with Horus."^
If Rekhmara does not, like Ptah-hotep, bear the
title of royal prince, he was perhaps of even higher
rank, since he is called " the double of the Pharaoh,"
animated by his spirit, taking his place in his absence,
governing all Egypt like him, addressed by the same
titles,^ and saluted like him by the courtiers. We
must not be astonished therefore at the royal title
given to Ptah-hotep ; the prefect of the capital was
next to the king the first person in the kingdom.
Although an interval of many centuries separated
the two prefects, it is probable that both governed
according to the same rules, and that little change had
taken place in the social state and ideas of the
Egyptian people. Rekhmara, after exercising the
' The title of " royal nurse '
' was independent of the function of nurse, and was merely a title of etiquette. Under Amenophis II there were at least two commanders of the royal ai-mies, Amenemheb and Pehsukher, whose wives were royal nurses. As it is very improbable that there were
two nurses, both of whom married, one after the other, the commanders of his army, we must suppose that the wife of the commander, in virtue of the dignity of her husband, could claim the same rank as one who had really been a nurse of the king. 2 For example, smen. hapu ( Tombeau de Rekhmara, pi. xviii.

THE PRECEPTS OF PTAH-HOTEP
viceroyalty in the absence of Thothmes III, insists
before all else on the conservative character of his
government.^ The temples, the laws, the principles
on which society rested, all remained unshaken ; the
children of the nobility succeeded their fathers regu
larly ; everything, in short, continued as if the king
remained perpetually in his capital, and the same hand
had governed Egypt since the mythical age of Horus.
All its kings and their ministers were only the images
and substitutes of the god who had been the first to
reign over the country ; the principles of government,
like the principles of morality, were of divine origin ;
nothing could be changed. Ptah-hotep had asserted
this of the past and predicted it of the future ; inno
vators had no place in Egypt, and their ephemeral
success had always been followed by reaction. "Let
none make innovations," he had said, " in the precepts
of his father ; let the same precepts form his instruc
tion to his children."^ Doubtless innovators some
times made themselves heard by the uninstructed
multitude and influenced the public for a moment,
but their triumph was momentary. Nothing, then,
must be taken away or added, nothing changed in
established principles, and whoever found contrary
ideas growing up in himself must be careful to root
them out.^ Thus, in order to discover the earliest
trace of the struggle between established custom and
new ideas, between the conservative and the radical,

RECORDS OF THE PAST
it is necessary to go back to the oldest book in the
world. Thanks to this horror of change in the government
and society of ancient Egypt, the documents which

doubtless give us sufficient information in regard to
the occupations of the prefect Ptah-hotep. Interest
ing resemblances, moreover, between certain chapters
of the Papyrus Prisse and the texts of the Tobm of
Rekhmara authorise us in making this comparison.
These texts depict to us the divan of the Pasha or
Prefect of Thebes : " He sits in the divan, in order to
hear the petitions ... to give peace to the whole
country, dispensing justice without paying attention
to bribes, applications, (or) offerings, and he who has
petitioned him has not wept.^ . . . From early dawn
he has been up to listen all day to the petitions of the
provinces of the South and the provinces of the North.
He has not repelled small or great; the evil done to
the poor, the aged, or the afflicted is requited by
Horus to its author.^ . . . There is no inattention in
him to the matters about which he has been petitioned
;
he estimates the poor equally with the rich, appear
ing as peace-maker."'
Ptah-hotep also tells us how the prefect ought to
apply himself to fill the office of " leader of peace,"
with what care he ought to hear the explanations
offered by the parties to a suit, with what patience he

should try to unravel the truth from obscure state
ments and useless details : " When thou art a leader
of peace, listen well to the words of the petitioner.
Be not abrupt with him ; that would trouble him.
Do not say to him : Thou hast [already] said this.
Indulgence will encourage him to do that for the sake
of which he is come. As for being abrupt with the
plaintiff because he describes what happened when the
injury was done instead of complaining of the injury
itself, let it not be ! The way to obtain a clear
explanation is to listen with kindness."^
With the object of maintaining peace among their
subordinates by means of justice, one of the chief
cares of the prefects was to provide subsistence for
the people and to preserve them from want. Every
centre of population accordingly possessed a larit or
assemblage of magazines, where corn, wine, and all
sorts of provisions were stored and thoroughly well
guarded. No place, in fact, could have been more
secure, and we shall see how strictly all access to it
was forbidden to the stranger.
The word larit appears to mean a well-guarded
enclosure^ ; among the duties which Ptah-hotep
insists upon in his Precepts, one of those to which he
attaches most importance is that of vigilantly guard

ing the larit : "If," he says, "thou art employed at
the larit, stand or sit rather than walk about. Deter
mine from the first not to absent thyself even when
weariness overtakes thee. Keep an eye on him who
enters, declaring that the object of his request is
secret ; what is consigned to thee is above apprecia
tion, and all contrary argument is to be rejected. He
is a god who penetrates into a place where no relaxa
tion (of the rules) is made for the privileged."^
Am-n-teh, overseer and director of the larit, tells
us that there was no repose for him, and that he never
closed his eyes during the night.^
The presentation of the seal of the prefect alone
could open the door.' Thus Rekhmara caused the
storehouses to be constantly inspected by officials to
whom he deputed his powers.* Well guarded as they
were, he was constantly on the watch to assure him
self that nothing was wanting to their safety. But
only himself or his deputy could enter them ; for all
others the doors were carefully closed, and it was he
who consigned the care of them to the guards.^ The
officials were empowered to strike even a delegate of
the government who had not presented the seal and
produced his authorisation to enter.®
But the prefect did not confine himself to the
superintendence of the storehouses ; he also saw that
they were filled, since on his supervision depended for
his subordinates abundance or death. When Egypt

had become a conquering, maritime, and commercial
power, foreign countries further contributed to the support of the larit ; the tombs of Rekhmara and
Am-n-teh show us the wines of Syria, the essences
and woods of Comal imported from afar and passing through the bazaars of Coptos. But it was still the
taxes which furnished corn, the most necessary of
provisions, and it is probable that under Ptah-hotep
Egypt was engaged solely in filling with it its maga
zines. The tomb of Rekhmara depicts for us the
labourers presenting the agents of the prefect with
their crop of wheat, in order that the government
might receive its share. They empty their baskets
and form a heap, from which the delegate of the
treasury measures on.t the amount due to the State.' The tax must have been somewhat heavy. The
Bible tells us that Joseph took from the agricultural
population the fifth part of their grain to store the
larits in view of a famine (Gen. xlvii. 24). In any
case the taxpayers who came so humbly before
Rekhmara, with their faces to the ground, must in
reality have been less submissive than they appeared
to be through fear of the stick. Even Ptah-hotep
mistrusted the tendency to revolt which might lie
hid under such forced humility, and it was not
enough for him that the taxpayer should put on a
submissive air when paying his tax, it was necessary
that his manner should be gay. " Let thy counten
ance be cheerful," he says, " during the time of thy

existence. When we see one leaving the storehouse
who has entered in order to bring his moiety of
provisions, with the countenance contracted, it shows
that his stomach is empty and that authority is
offensive to him. Let not this be thy case." ^ He is
continually recalling the services rendered by the
Government and declaring that it is not sufficient to
serve it ; it is necessary to love it and cause it to be
loved.^ If there are superiors and inferiors, it is
because God has so willed it ; ^ all authority, all
governors, are entitled to respect; when things are
prosperous, the absence of submission to authority
may endanger them.* The inferior ought to obey
blindly and execute all commands without discussing
them ; ^ however he may act in obeying a superior,
his conscience is clear before God ; ^ the superior
alone is responsible.
In return for the submission which it exacts, the
Government takes care of the wants of the people ; it
supports and enables them to live. In the tomb of
Rekhmara we see the workmen of foreign race
presenting themselves before the storehouses with
sacks to be filled with grain ;'^ jars of oil, wine, etc.,
are also distributed among them. In a similar
' Papyrus Prisse, pi. xiv. 1. 12 ; pi. xv. 1. a, ch. xxxiv. It is possible, however, that as the verb "to bring" sometimes signifies "to carry away," Ptah-hotep had here in view not taxpayers who found that the State took too much away from them but salaried officials who thought that it did not pay them enough. ^ Id., pi. xii. 11. 9-13, ch. xxvii.

fashion the sons of Jacob came to fill their sacks in
the storehouses organised by Joseph. But Ptah
hotep reminds the great of the earth that their duty
is not only to protect in this way those whom God
has confided to their authority. He who is placed in
front, at the head of a large number of men, must be
without reproach, and in spite of his power never
forget that there are laws. The forgetfulness of this
principle is the cause of revolutions ; when the great
neglect their duty, why should not the small take
their place "i ^ It is not of the counsels of the
flatterers of to-day that it is needful to take heed ; it
is of the judgment of posterity, which renders justice
to righteous actions.^ To appear before it with
honour, it is necessary to reverence knowledge and
wisdom ; to observe in everything a just moderation ;^
not to abuse one's powers ; and to seek to inspire love
rather than fear. For God forbids us to terrify the
feeble ; * on the contrary, we are as gods to the
inferiors, whose confidence we have known how to
gain.' The great man should remember that he is
only the dispenser of the gifts of God, and if, being of
low origin, he has attained to high honour, he must
not, as is too often the case, be pufied up by his good
fortune, but should consider the new duties which
his rank imposes on him.® His position makes of

him a steward of God, but a responsible steward.
For if the inferior has no responsibility in obeying,
the superior has in commanding and cannot avoid it.
God has imposed different duties according to differ
ent stations in life. Thus the inferior who carries the
message of a superior to a superior must transmit it
faithfully and exactly, even if he thinks that the
communication will not be well received.^ On his
side, the superior who sits in the council must declare
candidly what he believes best, even in presence of
the president, however exalted he may be, and not
twist his words so as not to compromise himself^
He must only see that he does not deceive himself,
since to deliberate in the council is not a pastime,^
and he must for that end work hard and devote
himself to his task.* Responsibility and continuous
labour is the lot of him who watches over the public
weal. In return it is right that he should obtain
some compensations. His life is not subject to the
discretion of any one ; within the limits of his con
science he is the master of his own actions ; but it is
the reward of his labours ; moreover, if the conditions
of life differ in this world, it is because God has so
willed it.^
There are of course duties common to all men, at
least to all who can read Ptah-hotep, for his book is
addressed to the educated classes." Thus the great
must abstain from plundering as the small from

thieving ; ^ each must love his household and his
wife,^ making her happy ; ^ must treat his people
well, being recompensed in return by their good will ; *
must avoid licentiousness ; ^ must listen without anger
to a just observation and feel no resentment towards him who has made it ; ^ must shun bad temper and
walk in loyalty and frankness

power of criticism in judging himself rather than
others ; ^ must speak pleasantly, and refer to that
which is bad by showing that it is bad, but without
passion ; ® must argue with courtesy, answering with
kindness him who deceives himself, and not be rude
to him should he display ignorance.^"
But among all other duties there is one on which
the book insists specially ; every one should labour
to make his son a true gentleman, and not allow the
authority given him by God to be weakened." The
father ought to command, the son to obey, in order
that he may be worthy of governing one day in his
turn the children which may be born to him.^^ " Good when he obeys and good when he commands, who
ever has obeyed has profited, and it is profitable to
obey him who has obeyed. The son who accepts the
word of his father will attain old age on that account.

to Him." ^ Accordingly the father must display no
weakness ; a son without principles will bring grief to
his parents ; ^ on the other hand, when the son is
obedient to his father, it is a double joy for both.^
It is not astonishing that Ptah-hotep paid so much
attention to paternal authority ; the family is the
foundation of society, and the school of obedience is
the family. Docile children will not be turbulent
subjects to the prefect.
The whole system of morality is practical. " More
over," says Professor Maspero, " we must not expect
to find in this work deep profundity of conception. . . .
Ptah-hotep does not trouble himself to invent or to
draw conclusions." ^ This pleases God ; that dis
pleases Him ; such is the ordinary argument, at
least when the author does not offer, as the sanction
of his morality, the hope of a good place for the
laborious and docile student,^ the hope of a long life
for the obedient son,^ and the hope of being faithfully
served by his domestics for the good master.'
The artlessness which we find in these counsels
should not make us inattentive to the spirit of
refinement which also appears in the writings of Ptah
hotep. He is not the author of the precepts which
he gives ; his practical philosophy has been be
queathed to him by his ancestors,^ but he has put the

precepts in verse in order to establish them in the
memory of mankind ; the poetical form in which he
clothes them is intended to preserve them from
alteration in the future.^ The most ancient book in
the world is therefore a rhythmic, if not a poetical,
work, and we can gather from this to what a height
civilisation had already attained. Although the
author himself recognises that humanity has still
much progress to make, and that the learned are in
reality only students,^ this fact alone would suffice to
prove that Egyptian society had long since left
barbarism behind it^ in the reign of Assa when
Ptah-hotep compiled his treatise, as he tells us at its
commencement.

"brilliant youth" (as in the Booi of the Dead, ch. 87, line 2). Ahu

There is no prudence in taking part in it, and thousands of men destroy themselves in order to enjoy a moment, brief as a dream, while they gain death, so as to know it.

To attend [therefore] profits the son of him who has attended. To attend ^ is the result of the fact that one has
attended. A [teachable] auditor is formed, because I have attended. Good when he has attended, good when he speaks,* he who has attended has profited, and it is profitable to attend to him who has attended. To attend is worth more than anything [else], for it produces love, the good thing that is twice good. The son who accepts the instruction of his father will grow old on that account.^ What God loves is that one should attend ; if one attends not, it is abhorrent to God. The heart makes itself its own master when it attends and when it does not attend ; [but] if it attends, then his heart is a beneficent [master] to a man.* In attending to instruction, a man loves what he attends to, and to do that which is prescribed is pleasant. When a son attends to his father, it is a twofold joy [for both] ; when [wise] things are prescribed to him, the son is gentle towards [his] master. Attending to him who has attended when such [things] have been prescribed to him, he engraves upon [his] heart that which is approved by his father; and the recollection of it is preserved in the mouth of the living who exist upon this earth.

As for the man without experience who listens not, he effects nothing whatsoever.

Cause [therefore] that to flourish which is just, in order to nourish thy children [with it]. If the teachers allow themselves to be led towards evil principles verily the people who understand them not will speak accordingly,^ and that being said to those who are docile, they will act accordingly.

THE DAUGHTER OF THE PRINCE OF BAKHTAN AND THE SPIRIT THAT POSSESSED HER
Translated by Prof. Maspero
The monument which has preserved for us this
curious narrative is a stele discovered by Champollion
in the temple of Khonsu at Thebes, and removed
from thence in 1886 by Prisse d'Avennes, by whom
it was given to the Biblioth^que Nationale at Paris.
The text has been published by Prisse d'Avennes :
Choix de Monuments igyptiens (Paris, 1847); ^nd
Champollion : Monuments de I'Egypte et de la Nubie
(Paris, 1846-76, vol. ii. pp. 280-90); and translated
by Birch : Notes upon an Egyptian Inscription in the
Bibliotheque Imphiale of Paris (in the Transactions
of the Royal Society of Literature, iv. new series)
;
and E. de Roug6 : Jitude sur une Stele ^gyptienne
appartenant a la Bibliotheque Impiriale (in the Journal
Asiatique, Aug. 1856, Aug. 1857, 1""^ and Aug.
1858). Champollion had already studied the text and
has cited many phrases from it in his works. It
was sumptuously reproduced on a single sheet at



THE DAUGHTER OF THE PRINCE OF BAKHTAN 37
the Imperial Printing-Press for the Paris Exhibition
of 1855 under the superintendence of E. de Rougd.
Little has been added by later works to de
Rouge's results. Translations of it have been given
by Brugsch in his History of Egypt (English trans
lation, 2d edit, ii. pp. 191-4), and by Maspero in
his Contes ^gyptiens, ii. pp. 209-224.
The narrative presents the appearance of an
official document. The Ramses recorded in it was
believed to be the twelfth of the name who belonged
to the twentieth dynasty, and efforts were made to
discover the country of Bakhtan in the map. The
account begins with a royal protocol in the name of a sovereign who has the same names and prmtomina
as Ramses II or Sesostris. Next come dates which
follow a definite order throughout the text; the
details of the cult of the deity and of the Pharaonic
ceremonial are described with scrupulous exactitude.
The whole possesses such a character of probability
that the inscription was considered historical until
quite recently. Prof. Erman, however, has shown
with much sagacity that we must recognise in it a
pure fiction invented by the priests of Khonsu in order to heighten the glory of the god and the
importance of his temple ; see A. Erman : Die
Bentreschstele in the Zeitschrift fiir aegyptische
Sprache, 1883, pp. 5 3 -60. Prof Erman has made it clear that the forgers
intended to assign the narrative to the reign of
Ramses II, and has thus relieved us from an



38 RECORDS OF THE PAST
imaginary Pharaoh. He has brought the redaction
of the story down to the Ptolemaic period, but I
believe that I can attribute it to the earlier days
of the Ethiopian invasions, when the high-priest of
Amon was about to fall, and the great priesthoods
which still existed at Thebes were to endeavour by
all the means in their power to inherit the influence
which the fallen priesthood had exercised.
The narrative refers to a belief which is common
in popular literature ; a spirit has entered the body
of a princess and struggles against the exorcists who
have been commissioned to expel it, consenting to
depart only on certain conditions. The story
furnishes us with the simplest and most ancient form
of the belief A modern Egyptologist has adopted
it as the subject of a novelette (H. Brugsch : Des
Priesters Rache, eine historisch beglaubigte Erziihlung
aus der aegyptischen Geschichte des zivblften Jahr
hunderts vor Ch'istits, in the Deutsche Revue, v. pp.
15-41)
Prof Erman has noted in the narrative an
affectation of archaism and somewhat serious errors
of language. We can understand that the priests of
Khonsu have endeavoured to imitate the language
of the period to which they attributed the monument.
We can also understand that they could not be
equally successful everywhere in maintaining an
archaistic tone, and have thus at times committed
errors. The sentences are badly constructed, the
expression of ideas is poor, the phrase curt and flat.



THE DA UGHTER OF THE PRINCE OF BAKHTAN 39
Moreover, they have assigned to a king of the nineteenth dynasty methods of government which
belonged only to sovereigns of the twentieth.
Ramses II, devout as he was, would never have
considered it necessary to submit to the approval
of the gods all the affairs of state ; it was the last
successors of Ramses III who introduced the custom
of consulting the statue of Amon upon every
occasion. With these reservations it may be
admitted that the text offers no further difficulties
to the interpreter, and with a little attention can be
easily translated ; like the Story of the Two Brothers
it can be advantageously placed in the hands of
beginners in Egyptian.
The stele is surmounted by a tableau in which
one of the scenes in the story is enacted before our
eyes. On the left, the bark of Khonsu, the good
counsellor, is carried on the shoulders of eight
porters and is followed by two priests reading prayers
;
the king, standing before it, offers incense to it. On
the right, the bark of Khonsu, which regulates the
destinies of Thebes, is figured, carried by four men
only, for it is smaller than the other ; the priest who
offers incense to it is the prophet of Khonsu who
regulates the destinies of Thebes, Khonsu-ha-nutir
nibit. It is probably the return of the second god
to Thebes which is thus illustrated : the first
Khonsu comes to receive the second, and the priest
and king each render equal homage to his divinity.

The prince of Bakhtan sent his tributes and set his eldest daughter at the head of the procession, to salute his Majesty and to ask hfe from him. She was a very beautiful woman, who pleased his Majesty more than anything else ; taking her as his chief royal wife he inscribed her with the name of Nofiru-ri, and when he had returned to Egypt he assured to her the treatment of a royal wife.^ And it came to pass in the fifteenth year, the 2 2d day of the month Payni, when his Majesty was at Thebes in the temple Nakhthonit-rofeii^ chaunting the praises of his father Amon-Ra the master of Karnak, during his excellent festival in southern Thebes,* the favourite residence of the god since the creation, behold a message is brought to his Majesty : " There is there a messenger of the prince of Bakhtan who is come with numerous presents for the royal wife." Conducted before his Majesty with his
presents, he says, invoking his Majesty : " Glory to thee, O Sun of foreign peoples, to thee by whom we live," and when he had uttered his adoration before his Majesty, he proceeds to speak to his Majesty : " I come to thee, sire, my master, concerning Bint-Rashit,^ the younger sister of thyself and the royal wife Nofiru-ri, for a malady penetrates her limbs. Let thy Majesty order a sage to set forth to see her." Then the king said : " Bring me the scribes of the double house of life who are attached to the palace."
1 The word mafkait expresses emerald, green jasper, green feldspar, various oxides of copper, malachite ; in short, every kind of precious stone which is naturally coloured green. "^ The daughter of the prince of the Hittites, Khiti-saru, similarly received from Ramses II on her arrival in Egypt the title of '
' chief royal wife " and the Egyptian name of Ma-ur-nofiru-ri, of which the name of the princess in the text is probably only an abridged form. 3 These words, which literally signify "the strong one, the lady of the temples," probably denote one of the chapels in the temple of Karnak. * Southern Thebes was the modern Luxor ; the festival, consequently, must have been the festival of the patron deity in the temple of Luxor. ^ The name of this princess appears to be formed from the Semitic tint, "daughter," and the Egyptian rashit, "joy," the signification being " Daughter of joy."

When they were come, his Majesty said : " Behold I have summoned you in order that you may hear these words : ' Bring me one of yourselves who is expert in his heart, a scribe skilful with his fingers.' " When the royal scribe Thothimhabi had entered the presence of his Majesty, his Majesty commanded him to betake himself to Bakhtan with this messenger. As soon as the sage had arrived in Bakhtan he found Bint-Rashit possessed of a demon, and he found the demon who possessed her difficult to combat. The prince of Bakhtan thereupon sent a second message to his Majesty, saying : " Sire, my master, let thy Majesty order a god to be sent to combat the demon." When the messenger reached his Majesty in the 23d year, the ist day of the month Pakhons, the day of the festival of Amon, while his Majesty was at Thebes, behold his Majesty spoke again in the presence of Khonsu in Thebes, the god of good counsel, saying : " Excellent lord, behold me again before thee, concerning the daughter of the prince of Bakhtan." ^ Then Khonsu in Thebes, the god of good counsel, was transported towards Khonsu who governs destiny, the great god who drives away strangers, and his Majesty said before the face of Khonsu in Thebes, the god of good counsel : " Excellent lord, if it pleases thee to turn thy face to Khonsu who governs
' In order to understand this passage, we must remember that according to Egyptian belief every statue of a god in a temple had in it a ka or "double," detached from the actual person of the god and so an incarnation of the god different from his other incarnations. The god Khonsu had in his temple at Karnak two statues at least, each of which was animated by an independent '
' double, '
' whom the rites of consecration had detached from the god. One of them represented Khonsu, immutable in his perfection, tranquil in his greatness, and not directly interfering with the affairs of men ; this was Khonsu Nofir-hotpu, whose name I have paraphrastically translated " the god of good counsel." The other statue represented a more active Khonsu who governed the affairs of mankind and drove away foreigners (that is to say enemies) from Egypt {Khonsu p.
iri sokhru m uisit, nutir da, sakru shemau). The first IChonsu, being considered the more powerful, we know not why, does not condescend to go himself to Syria, but sends the second Khonsu after having transferred to; the latter his own powers (E. de Roug6 : Etude sur une sUle, pp. 15-19)



THE DAUGHTER OF THE PRINCE OF BAKHTAN 43
destiny, the great god who drives away strangers, he will be sent to Bakhtan." And the god twice decidedly nodded assent with the head.i Then his Majesty said : " Grant unto him thy virtue so that I may send the Majesty of this god to Bakhtan in order to deliver the daughter of the prince of Bakhtan." And Khonsu in Thebes, the god of good counsel, violently nodded assent twice and transmitted his magical virtue to Khonsu who governs destiny in Thebes, four times.^ His Majesty ordered Khonsu who governs destiny in Thebes to be despatched on a great bark, escorted by five boats, by chariots and by numerous horses which walked on the right and on the left. When the god had arrived in Bakhtan, after an interval of a year and five months, behold the prince of Bakhtan came with his soldiers and his generals before Khonsu who governs destiny, and flung himself on his face, saying :
1 The statues, being animated by a "double," declared tlieir will
either by the voice or by rhythmical movements. We know that queen
Hatshopsitu "heard" the god Amon commanding her to send an expedition to the "Coasts of Incense," in order to fetch the perfumes necessary for religious worship. The kings of the twentieth and twentyfirst dynasties, less fortunate than she, were gratified only with gestures, which were always the same ; when they put a question to a god the statue remained motionless if the answer were negative, but twice shook the head violently if it were favourable. The inquiries were made in accordance with a fi.xed ritual, the chief points in which have been preserved in contemporaneous texts. * The innate virtue of the gods (so) seems to have been regarded by the Egyptians as a sort of fluid analogous to that called by us "the electric fluid" or the like. It was transmitted by the imposition of hands and mesmeric "passes" over the neck or spine of the patient ; this was called sotpu sa, which we may render " to make passes." The ceremony whereby the first Khonsu transferred his virtue to the second is frequently represented on the monuments in the scenes where a statue of 1 god is making passes over a king. The statue, which was usually of wood, had movable limbs ; it embraced the king and passed its hand four times over the nape of his neck while he knelt before it with his back turned towards it. Every statue received at its consecration not only a " double" but also a portion of the magical virtue of the deity whom it represented ; the " sa of life" was "behind it," which animated and penetrated within it so far as the statue did not lessen the amount of the magical virtue by transmission. The god himself, whom this perpetual flow of the sa would have ended by exhausting, replenished himself with a supply of it from a mysterious source in the other world : we are not told how it happened that the source could not be exhausted (Maspero : BtiUetin critique de la religion dgyptienne. Le Rituel dtt Sacrifice fundraire, pp. 17-18, 28-29).



44 RECORDS OF THE PAST
"Thou comest to us, thou rejoinest us according to the orders of the king of the two Egypts, Usir-ma-ri Sotpu-niri." Behold as soon as the god was gone to the place where Bint-Rashit was and had made magical passes over the daughter of the prince of Bakhtan, she found herself well at once, and the demon which was with her said in the presence of Khonsu who governs destiny in Thebes : "Come in peace, great god who drivest away the foreigner; Bakhtan is thy city, its people are thy slaves, and I myself am thy slave. I shall depart therefore to the place from whence I am come, in order to satisfy thy heart concerning the matter which brings thee, but let thy Majesty order a day of festival to be celebrated for me and for the prince of Bakhtan." The god made his prophet a sign of approval with the head, meaning to say ; " Let the prince of Bakhtan present a great offering to this demon." Now while this was taking place between Khonsu who governs destiny in Thebes and the demon, the prince of Bakhtan was there with his army stricken with terror. And when a great offering had been presented to Khonsu who governs destiny in Thebes and to the demon of the prince of Bakhtan, and a day of festival had been celebrated in their honour, the demon departed in peace to the place which pleased him, according to the order of Khonsu who governs destiny in Thebes. The prince of Bakhtan rejoiced greatly as well as the people of Bakhtan, and he discoursed with his heart saying: "Since this god has been given to Bakhtan I shall not send him back to Egypt." Now after the god had remained three years and nine months in Bakhtan, as the prince of Bakhtan was lying on his bed, he saw in a dream the god leaving his shrine in the form of a golden hawk which flew on high towards Egypt ; when he awoke he was in a shiver. Then he said to the prophet of Khonsu who governs destiny in Thebes : " This god who dwelt with us, he returns to Egypt ; let his chariot go to Egypt ! " The prince of Bakhtan allowed the god to start for Egypt, and he gave him numerous presents of all good things as well as a strong escort of soldiers and



THE DAUGHTER OF THE PRINCE OF BAKHTAN 45
horses. When they reached Thebes, Khonsu who governs destiny in Thebes entered the temple of Khonsu in Thebes the good counsellor ; he set the presents which the prince of Bakhtan had given him before Khonsu in Thebes, the good counsellor, he kept nothing for his own temple. Now Khonsu, the good counsellor in Thebes, re-entered his temple in peace the 19th day of the month Mekhir, the 33d year of the king Usir-ma-ri Sotpu-ni-ri, living for ever like the Sun.



HYMN TO THE NILE
Translated by Paul Guieysse
The Hymn to the Nile is, properly speaking, not a
religious document like those, for example, of the
Funerary Ritual, whose history can be followed from
century to century, but a religious poem in the same
sense as that in which the Poem of Pentaur is a his
torical poem. It is the work of the scribe Ennana,
the author of the Story of the Two Brothers and
of several other fragments contained in the papyri of
the British Museum. We possess two copies of it in
the papyri Sallier II and Anastasi VII ; both texts,
however, are extremely poor. Prof Maspero was
the first to translate them in 1868,^ and to show
from an examination of the variant readings that
they must have been transcribed from dictation by
pupils in the schools of the scribes, though not from
the same original text. The translation of Prof.
Maspero has often been reproduced in works on
Egypt, and Canon Cook has given a translation
which differs from it but little.^ In the present
1 Hymne au Nil. Franck, Paris i858. '' Records of the Past, IV. Bagster & Sons, London 1875.



HYMN TO THE NILE 47
translation notice has been taken, as far as possible,
of the recent progress of Egyptological knowledge ; it
will appear with a complete transcription of the two
texts in the Recmil des Travaux relatifs a VEgypt
ologie}
The text of the Hymn is divided into fourteen
verses, introduced by red letters, and each, with two
exceptions, containing the same number of complete
phrases, separated from one another by red points.
Unfortunately we are still ignorant of the rules of
Egyptian poetry ; but as the variant readings show
that the number of syllables in one and the same
sentence is not the same in the different texts, it is
probable that the tonic accent played a chief part in
it. We find, however that the order of the words
is clearly not the same as in ordinary prose.^
The author has developed the idea, well-known
even to classical antiquity, that the Nile is the source
of all life in Egypt, that it is the supreme god, mys
terious, uncreated, the father of the gods and all
things else, into whose secrets none can penetrate.
He describes in a lofty style the benefits conferred
by the Nile when it spreads its waters over the
country at its annual return, and the miseries of the
land when the inundation has not exercised its fer
tilising influence, as well as the joy of the inhabitants
of Egypt and their gratitude when the Nile has
answered their prayers.
' Vol. xiii. Bouillon, Paris 1890. ^ Notably in verse 2, phrases 7 and 8, and in verse 14, phrase i.



HYMN TO THE NILE
Adoration to the Nile ! Hail to thee, Nile ! who manifesteth thyself over this land, and comest to give life to Egypt ! Mysterious is thy issuing forth from the darkness, on this day whereon it is celebrated ! Watering the orchards created by Ra^ to cause all the cattle to live, thou givest the earth to drink, inexhaustible one ! Path that descendest from the sky,^ loving the bread of See and the firstfruits of Nepera, thou causest the workshops of Ptah^ to prosper !
II
Lord of the fish, during the inundation, no bird alights on the crops. Thou createst the corn, thou bringest forth the barley, assuring perpetuity to the temples.* If thou ceasest thy toil and thy work, then all that exists is in anguish.
^ The orchards of Ra are mentioned in the Book of the Dead, ch. 8i. " This belief in the celestial origin of the Nile survived in Egypt, at al 1 events as late as the time of Joinville (Histoire de Saint-Louis, ch. xl. ). ^ Ptah is associated with the Nile in a list of divinities represented on a
wall of the age of Ramses II at Karnak (ChampoUion : Not. Manu
scrites II. p. 255, where Ptah is called Pta/i, pa Hapi aa). * In the Anastasi text : "Causing the temples to keep holiday."



If the gods suffer in heaven ^ then the faces of men waste away.

Then he torments the flocks of Egypt, and great and small are in agony. But all is changed for mankind when he comes
;
he is endowed with the quahties of Num.^ If he shines, the earth is joyous, every stomach is full of rejoicing, every spine is happy, every jaw-bone crushes (its food).
IV
He brings the offerings,^ as chief of provisioning
;
he is the creator of all good things, as master of energy, full of sweetness in his choice. If offerings are made it is thanks to him. He brings forth the herbage for the flocks,* and sees that each god receives his sacrifices. All that depends on him is a precious incense. He spreads himself over Egypt, filling the granaries, renewing the marts, watching over the goods of the unhappy.
He is prosperous to the height of all desires, without fatiguing himself therefor. He brings again his lordly bark
;
he is not sculptured in stone, in the statues crowned with the urseus serpent,
' The Nile is not only the dispenser of life to mankind, but also to the
gods (see verses 4, 10, 13). In the Hymn it absorbs as it were all the gods, and even takes the place of Ra in verse 14. ^ Num, the divine creator, hke Ptah, is similar to Ptah in his relation to the Nile. The two verses point out that all life is dependent on the Nile, an idea which is developed to excess in the verses following. 2 Funerary offerings made to the ka or " double." * See verse 14.

he cannot be contemplated. No servitors has he, no bearers of offerings ! He is not enticed by incantations ! None knows the place where he dwells, None discovers his retreat by the power of a written spell. ^
VI
No dwelling (is there) which may contain thee ! None penetrates within thy heart
!
Thy young men, thy children applaud thee and render unto thee royal homage. Stable are thy decrees for Egypt ^ before thy servants of the North ! ^ He stanches the water from all eyes and watches over the increase of his good things.
VII
Where misery existed, joy manifests itself; all beasts rejoice. The children of Sebek, the sons of Neit,* the cycle of the gods which dwells in him, are prosperous. No more reservoirs for watering the fields ! He makes mankind valiant, enriching some, bestowing his love on others. None commands at the same time as himself.
' The gods had to submit to the power of incantations and magic
formulee (compare the legend of Ra bitten by a serpent, the romance of Setnau, and numerous passages in the Book of the Dead). The Nile alone was excepted from this law ; it remained enshrouded in mystery in its retreat near the two whirlpools often mentioned in the texts and even alluded to by Herodotus. ^ So in the Anastasi text. The fixity of the periodic return of the Nile is probably referred to. ' Verse s has, however, stated that the Nile had no servants ; perhaps
the secondary gods are meant here who directed the spread of the waters over Egypt, that is to the north of the whirlpools from whence the Nile rose, * Neit is often represented with two crocodiles on the breast ; her relation to Sebek, the crocodile-god, is difficult to define.



HYMN TO THE NILE 51
He creates the offerings without the aid of Neit/ making mankind for himself with multiform care.
VIII
He shines when he issues forth from the darkness, to cause his flocks to prosper. It is his force that gives existence to all things ; nothing remains hidden for him. Let men clothe themselves to fill his gardens. He watches over his works, producing the inundation during the night.^ It is a god Ptah . . .^ He causes all his servants to exist, all writings and divine words,* and that which he needs in the North.
IX
It is with the words that he penetrates iijto his dwelling
;
he issues forth at his pleasure through the magic spells.^ Thy unkindness brings destruction to the fish ; it is then that prayer is made for the (annual) water of the season
;
Southern Egypt is seen in the same state as the North. Each one is with his instruments of labour,
1 Neit appears here as the goddess of production ; the Nile has no need of Neit (or perhaps the rain) in order to generate the crops ; it malces its way throughout the country by means of canals and trenches. ^ This seemsjto be an allusion to the festival of the "Night of the Drop" (LUet en-Nuqta), still observed in Egypt on the 5th of June, when the rise of the Nile is supposed to commence. The name is due to the old tradition recorded by Plutarch, according to which the rise of the Nile was caused by a tear which dropped into it from the eye of Isis. In M. Am^lineau's Conies et Romans de V Egypte Chritiennes, i. p. 17, the rise of the Nile is attributed to the intercession of St. IVIichael, whose festival is celebrated on the 6th of June ; three days ,before, the archangel prays that the water may rise, since it is " the life of men and animals." 2 Unknown word, conjectured by Cook to represent the name of a new god Kabes. ^ The Nile inspires Thoth the scribe of the divine utterances. 5 The Nile is unaffected by incantations, but serves himself with them at his pleasure in order to manifest himself.



52 RECORDS OF THE PAST
none remains behind his companions. None clothes himself with garments, the children of the noble put aside their ornaments. The night remains silent, but all is changed by the inundation
;
it is a healing-balm for all mankind.
X
Establisher of justice ! mankind desires thee, supplicating thee to answer their prayers ; thou answerest them by the inundation ! Men offer the first-fruits of corn ; all the gods adore thee ! The birds descend not on the soil. It is believed that with thy hand of gold thou makest bricks of silver ! But we are not nourished on lapis-lazuli
;
corn alone gives vigour.^
XI
A
festal song is raised for thee on the harp, with the accompaniment of the hand.^ Thy young men and thy children acclaim thee and prepare their (long) exercises. Thou art the august ornament of the earth, letting thy bark advance before men, lifting up the heart of women in labour, and loving the multitude of the flocks.
1 The Nile is indeed the dispenser of all wealth, but true wealth does not consist in gold or silver, but of the products of agriculture which enable men to live.
2 Women are represented on the monuments accompanying the singers by clapping the hands ; this custom still survives throughout the East. It is possible that we still possess the festal songs of the Nile, of which Lane has preserved for us some fragments in his work on The Modern Egyptians.



HYMN TO THE NILE 53
XII
When thou shinest in the royal city,^ the rich man is sated with good things, the poor man even disdains the lotus
;
all that is produced is of the choicest
;
all the plants exist for thy children. If thou hast refused (to grant) nourishment,'' the dwelling is silent, devoid of all that is good the country falls exhausted.
XIII
O inundation of the Nile, offerings are made unto thee, oxen are immolated to thee, great festivals are instituted for thee. Birds are sacrificed to thee, gazelles are taken for thee in the mountain, pure flames are prepared for thee.^ Sacrifice is made to every god as it is made to the Nile.^ The Nile has made its retreats in Southern Egypt, its name is not known beyond the Tuau.* The god manifests not his forms, he baffles all conception.
XIV
Men exalt him like the cycle of the gods, they dread him who creates the heat, even him who has made his son^ the universal master in order to give prosperity to Egypt. Come (and) prosper ! come (and) prosper !
^ Probably Thebes, the residence of the^Pharaohs at the time when the
Hymn was composed. No other city can be meant, as otherwise the mythological texts would have mentioned it. Thebes, moreover, is near Silsilis, where the height of the Nile was measured, as is indicated by the Book of the Dead, chap. 149, and the royal decrees of Silsilis, which institute festivals in honour of the Nile. ^ These offerings are mentioned in the decrees of Silsilis.

LETTERS TO EGYPT FROM BABYLONIA, ASSYRIA, AND SYRIA, IN THE FIF
TEENTH CENTURY B.C.
Translated by the Editor
An account has already been given in these volumes
of the recent discovery of cuneiform tablets at Tel
el-Amarna in Upper Egypt, which prove to contain
official correspondence addressed to the Egyptian
monarchs of the Eighteenth Dynasty, Amenophis
III and his son, Amendphis IV, Khu-n-Aten, " The
Heretic King " {Records of the Past, new ser., vol. ii.
pp. 5 7 sq^ One statement, however, in that account
requires correction, in view of the letters from the
king of Mitanni, which have now been published. Queen Teie, the mother of Amen6phis IV, was not
the daughter of Duisratta or Dusratta, the Mitannian
king ; the daughter of the latter prince was Tadu
khepa, the wife of Amendphis IV. We are still in
the dark as to the parentage of Teie, and Prof
Maspero may be right in considering her to be of
Egyptian origin, possibly even a sister of Amen6
phis III.



S6 RECORDS OF THE PAST
In the following pages I have given translations
of the most important letters, from a historical point
of view, which have yet been published. They are
mostly to be found in the magnificent publication of
Messrs. Winckler and Abel, entitled Mittheilungen aus
den orientalischen Sammlungeji (Berlin, Spemann,
1889, 1890), of which two parts have appeared con
taining the texts of a considerable number of the
Tel el-Amarna tablets at Berlin and Cairo. The
promptitude and carefulness with which they have
been edited contrasts favourably with the tardi
ness of the authorities of the British Museum in
putting the collection of Tel el-Amarna tablets that
exists there at the service of scholars. Of the eighty
one tablets now in the British Museum four only
have been published (by Mr. Budge in the Proceed
ings of the Society of Biblical Archceology, June 1888).
A few passages in the letters have been translated
by Dr. Winckler in his Bericht ueber die Thontafeln
von Tel-el-Amarna in the Sitsungsberickte of the
Berlin Academy, 1888 (No. xxiii), and Dr. Zimmern
has translated four of the texts in the Zeitschrift fiir
Assyriologie, V. (1890). Three of these are the same
as'Nos. 2, 3, and 10 translated by myself in the
following pages.
An unexpected light is cast by these letters on
the literary education and intercourse which pre
vailed throughout the ancient civilised world from
the Euphrates to the Nile in the century before the
Exodus. The government of Egypt extended as far



LETTERS FROM BABYLONIA, ETC. 57
as Northern Syria, its political influence as far as the
frontiers of Assyria. But the culture of Western
Asia had its primitive home in Babylonia ; it was
the language and complicated script of Chaldsea
which were taught and studied in the distant coun
tries of the west, and which the educated gentleman
was required to learn. Egypt exported gold from
the mines which had been opened in the desert,
and were worked by convicts and the captives
taken in the Asiatic campaigns of the Eighteenth
Dynasty. These Asiatic campaigns, however, had tended to
Semitise the governing class in Egypt. The king
married into the families of Asiatic princes and
filled his court with Asiatic officials. Amenophis
IV even became a convert to a Semitic faith, and
endeavoured to substitute a belief in the supreme
Semitic Baal, who revealed himself in the fiery orb
of the sun, for the old religion of his people. His
dominions in Palestine and Syria were placed under
governors who bore Semitic names, mostly of a
purely Canaanitish stamp. Even the vizier himself
has a name which is otherwise not found outside the
Bible, although the name of the Carthaginian goddess
Dido indicates that it was not unknown to the Phoe
nicians. This is Dudu, the Dodo of the Old Testa
ment, etymologically related to David. Dudu's two
sons, Aziru and Khai, bear names which are equally
Biblical in their character.
The two letters of Aziru to his father show pretty



58 RECORDS OF THE PAST
plainly the position occupied by Dfldu in the king
dom of the Pharaoh. He alone is addressed like
the Pharaoh himself as " my lord," and even his son
calls himself his " servant." Perhaps, however, the
most significant phrase is that which speaks of
" Dftdu and the king my lord and the nobles." We
are reminded of what the Pharaoh said to Joseph,
" Only in the throne will I be greater than thou "
(Gen. xli. 40).
The letters of Aziru possess a further interest.
They bring the Hittites before us in the act of
descending from their old homes in the north upon
the fertile plains and cities of the Semites in the
south. Kadesh, on the Orontes, has not yet become
their southern capital ; but they are already threaten
ing Tunip, the Tennib of modern days, to the north
west of Aleppo. A century later, when the civil
wars were ended, which the death of Amendphis IV
and his attempt to introduce a Semitic religion and
a Semitic government into Egypt had occasioned,
when the stranger and his faith were driven from the
land, and the Nineteenth Dynasty was founded by
that " new king which knew not Joseph," the Hit
tites were encamped on the northern threshold of
Palestine. The Egyptian armies again marched into
Asia, but even the power of Ramses II was unable
to dislodge them from the post they had gained, and
the utmost he could do was to check their southward
advance. The chief result of his war was to weaken
both Egyptians and Hittites, and to exhaust the



LETTERS FROM BABYLONIA, ETC. 59
cities of Canaan, so that they became an easy prey
a few years later to the invading tribes of Israel.
Assur-yuballidh, king of Assyria, whose letter to
Amenophis IV I have placed first in my series of
translations, is mentioned towards the commence
ment of the so-called "Synchronous History of
Babylon and Assyria " (line 8) as a contemporary of
the Babylonian king Kara-Urus. We learn from the
letter the name of his father, Assur-nadin-akhi, who
must therefore be inserted between Assur-yuballidh
and Buzur-Assur (see " List of the Kings of Assyria,"
Records of the Past, new ser., vol. ii. p. 206). Buzur
Assur, as we learn from the " Synchronous History,"
was a contemporary of Burna-buryas, another corre
spondent of Amenophis IV. A third royal correspondent of the Egyptian
monarchs was Dusratta or Tusratta or Duisratta

for the name is written in these various ways — the
king of Mitanni. According to the Assyrian in
scriptions Mitanni was the district on the eastern
bank of the Euphrates which lay opposite to Car
chemish. It is called Maten in the Egyptian
inscriptions, and was included in the kingdom of Nahrina, the Aram-Naharaim, or " Aram of the two rivers," of Scripture, of which Chushan-rish-athaim
was king (Judges iii. 8). It is possible that an
obscure passage in one of the letters signifies that
the Mitannian prince claimed sovereignty also over
Khani-rabbat or eastern Kappadokia. Among the
tablets now at Berlin is a long letter from Dus



6o RECORDS OF THE PAST
ratta, written in cuneiform characters, but in the
language of Mitanni, which seems unlike any other
hitherto known. We gather from it that the father
and predecessor of Dusratta was Sutarna, who is
stated in an inscription on an Egyptian scarab to
have sent his daughter Kirkipa as a wife to Amend
phis III in the tenth year of the latter's reign, along
with 3 1 7 attendants. Artatamas, the grandfather of
Dusratta, had also married his daughter to Thoth
mes IV, so that for three generations the rulers of
Egypt and Mitanni had been connected by marriage
with one another.
The people of Mitanni, however, did not speak a
Semitic language, and it is probable that they did
not belong to the Semitic race. But they had
adopted the Semitic adoration of the winged solar
disk, and along with it, in all probability, some
portion of the Semitic worship of Baal. It was this
worship and adoration which Amenophis IV at
tempted to force upon his subjects. The Semitic
tendencies of the court and the dominance of Semitic
strangers from Canaan and Syria were due not so
much to the intermarriages with the royal family of
Mitanni as to the Egyptian conquest of Palestine.

ANCIENT BABYLONIAN AGRICULTURAL PRECEPTS
Translated by G. Bertin
The tablet which contains the agricultural precepts
is one of the series called by the Babylonians, from
the first line of the first tablet, uludinebisu = ana itti
sti} formerly read ki-kankala-bi-su = ana itti-su. This
collection, which must have contained at least ten or
twelve tablets, was a compendium of precepts and
prescriptions written at an early date in Akkadian
for the guidance of the people in their various pro
fessions.^ The work, as we know it from the frag
ments in the British Museum, is accompanied with
a Babylonian translation, probably of the time of
Sargon of Agade ; and the fragments recovered are
those of a Ninevite transcription made in the time of
Assurbanipal for his library.
The tablets are divided, into two columns, the left
hand one giving the Akkadian and the right-hand one
the translation. The first six tablets and part of the
seventh contained what may be called the comment
1 E. G. Pinches. 2 S. B. A., vol. viii. part 2 ; Akkadian Precepts, pp. 4 and 5.

ary, that is, the Hst of the most difficult words and
expressions, with explanations or translations. The
notion, strange at first sight, of beginning with the com
mentary, appears natural when we bear in mind that
these works were the text-books of the Babylonians,
which they had to copy in order to master their
complicated system of writing and the literary
Akkadian language^ ; the text-book therefore began,
as in our reading-books for children, with simple
expressions or isolated words ; the learner having
acquired these, next undertook and understood
without difficulty the connected text.
These tablets contained no laws, as has been
sometimes stated, but precepts drawn, perhaps by a
philosopher like Confucius or Mencius, from the
customs and usages of the time. The seventh tablet
contained " Precepts for a man in his private life." ^
The agricultural precepts covered no doubt more
than one tablet ; the only one we possess is partly
mutilated, and, the colophon being lost, we do not
know what place exactly it occupied in the collection.
What we possess, however, strange to say, has never
been entirely published ; the fragments found at
first were published by the trustees of the British
^ An exercise book (on clay) has been found in which some parts of these tablets have been copied three times over for practice ; this fragment of a copy-bool< is now in the British Museum. '' W. A. /., ii. pi. lo, and v. pis. 24 and 25. It is the tablet which
revealed to me the real character of this collection. See my paper which contains a translation of it ; it must be remembered that our knowledge of
Alckadian has made great progress since its publication. A mutilated
tablet of " Commercial Precepts," which belong probably to the same collection, is published, W. A. /., ii. pi. 13.

Museum,^ and a fragment found afterwards was pub
lished by Dr. Haupt.^ No complete translation of
the fragments has been attempted,' no doubt because
the tablet was considered to be a list of unconnected
words and sentences ; some of the paragraphs have,
however, been incidentally explained in order to sup
port the interpretation of other texts.*
In the following translation the Akkadian has
been taken as the standard text, but it has often
been necessary to follow the Babylonian translation.
Some parts of the translation are doubtful, partly on
account of the mutilated state of the text and partly
because, as many words are not found anywhere else,
we have no means of testing their signification/ and
some paragraphs are still obscure.

2 Keihchrifttexte, p. 74. In the same publication Dr. Haupt has also
republished the two first columns, pp. 71-73 ; it is difficult to see why he
has not also republished the other parts, so as to make the publication complete. ^ Prof. Sayce has given in the Records of the Past, vol. xi. p. 153, the translation of the fourth column nearly complete.
^ The difficult passages have been generally omitted, and in the vocabu
laries already made public many words found in these texts are left out.
6 I may also state that the translation is free, as my object is to give
the meaning of the text and not that of the isolated words ; I reserve the
discussion of the words for a critical paper, where the text can be reproduced.

(Two or more paragraphs and the colophon are lost.)
The tablet from which the above is a translation
is of great importance as giving us information and
particulars as to the system of land tenure and cul
tivation of the land in the early Akkadian period.
The tablet speaks first of the simple tenure, and it
shows (Paragraph It) that the tenure was to begin
legally from the sixth month, that is the Babylonian
Ululu. The end of that month is no doubt meant,
and it would tend to confirm the opinion that at an
earlier date Tisritu was the first and Ululu the last
month of the year, though the Babylonians might
have had an agricultural year, as we have a financial
year, a scholastic or university year, etc. After
having chosen the farm and agreed to the conditions
of the contract, the first step of the farmer was to
determine his position towards the treasury, for,
among the Babylonians as among us, the payment
of the taxes is a proof of the legality of the holding.



BABYLONIAN AGRICULTURAL PRECEPTS 99
After that the farmer had to gather his live stock.
The tablet says " gazelles," and so carries us back to
the earliest period, for the ox and sheep did not
come originally from Babylonia, and the first animal
domesticated there must have been a kind of gazelle
which was found wild in the country. In the tablet,
however, the word " gazelle " is no doubt taken to
mean any kind of quadruped ; in the same way the
word " birds " designates here domesticated birds,

doves, ostriches, and at a later period hens, which
were introduced a long time before the Persian
conquest.^ Being once established in his farm, he is
to give all his time to it.
After these preliminaries about tenure in general
come the specifications about the various kinds of
tenure. The first spoken of is the tenure by half, as
it is called ; it appears to signify the properties
which used to belong half to the lord and half to the
peasant who was attached to the soil as serf. In
that case the farmer worked for his master, he kept
the live stock and the seeds, but everything was
controlled by the agent of the landllord. In the field
of partnership, on the contrary, the landlord was
placed on the same footing as his tenant ; if the
latter gave his labour, the former had to provide him
with the material, implements, utensils, stock, grain,
seeds, etc. After a lacuna of a few paragraphs the tablet
1 I have found on a Babylonian contract tablet, two centuries older than Cyrus, the representation of a cock.



RECORDS OF THE PAST
speaks of the various works to be performed by the
agriculturist or farmer. The tenure of a fifth, or the
tenure in which the farmer took a fifth of the pro
duce for himself, was probably the most common in
early times, and for this reason is mentioned here
;
but we also get an account of the percentage to be
taken in the other sorts of tenure. To understand
this we must suppose that the character of the
tenure depended on the quality of the land; in very
bad land the farmer was obliged to take a third of
the produce to be able to subsist and be prepared
for the next season.
The first paragraphs of Column III are devoted
to what might be termed " legal specification." They
enumerate the various sorts of tenure, what are fur
nitures and fixtures, and the four sorts of garden,
probably private gardens independent of the farm
land. Then we are told about the general field work
to be performed independently of the growing of
seeds. The farmer may dissolve partnership or
resign his contract at the end of the eighth month
or Marcheswan, in fine weather, or at the time of
drying the dates, or when the palings are to be
pulled out, but only on certain conditions.
Column IV speaks of the works to be performed
independently of the field works, and contains very
interesting statements ; for instance, the farmer was
obliged to construct first the house of his workmen ;
we are even told that if the house is not constructed
properly he will have to pay a fine. It is also stated



BABYLONIAN AGRICULTURAL PRECEPTS loi
that the farmer must pay his men when the work is
finished.
Part of Paragraph XIX and the colophon are lost
at the end of the fourth column, but it is probable
that these precepts covered at least another tablet.
Before closing it is needful to remark again that
the tablet of agricultural precepts did not contain
laws but only precepts ; in the time of the Baby
lonian Empire these were no doubt consulted by the
lawyers, but the progress of civilisation had rendered
some of the prescriptions impracticable, and, as is
shown by the contract tablets recovered from
Babylon, the laws of land tenure had become much
more complicated.



THE INDIA HOUSE INSCRIPTION OF NEBUCHADREZZAR THE GREAT
Translated by the Rev. C. J. Ball
Whether we suppose that this famous relic of the
past embodies the ipsissima verba of the great king,
in whose name and by whose orders, at all events, it
was written and graven in imperishable stone ; or
that it is the set panegyrical composition of some one
of the literary men of his brilliant court ; will make
little difference to the deep interest which such a
monument must always inspire in the minds of
thoughtful readers of the prophecies of Jeremiah and
the picturesque traditions of the book of Daniel.
Here we have an unquestionable relic of the age of
the fall of the Jewish monarchy and the brilliant sun
set of Hebrew prophecy : an authentic record, pre
served almost intact in its original shape, of the very
sovereign whom Jeremiah declared to be Jehovah's
chosen servant, and whom, consequently, it was
Judah's duty as well as highest political wisdom to
obey. And not only this. The inscription paints
for us in unfading colours a portrait of the man
Nebuchadrezzar ; it exhibits in the vivid light of



THE INSCRIPTION OF NEBUCHADREZZAR 103
actuality his pride of place and power and great
ness, his strong conviction of his own divine call
to universal empire, his passionate devotion to his
gods, his untiring labours for their glory and the
aggrandisement of that peerless capital which was
their chosen dwelling-place.
The style of the inscription is elevated almost to
the level of poetry ; and the phraseology often recalls
familiar expressions of the Old Testament. If I
have not noted all such coincidences as they
occurred, it was because I felt that they were too
obvious and striking for even a cursory reader to
miss.
In correcting my former version {Proc. Soc. Bibl.
Arch., Dec. 1887) I have, of course, made use of the
other inscriptions of the king. The beautifully
written cylinder, numbered 85-4-30. i, Brit. Mus.,
has supplied several important corrections of the text.
(See Proc. Soc. Bibl. Arch., March 1889.) Some of the Accadian ideograms and words I
have succeeded in explaining and illustrating by
means of their Chinese representatives, as will be
seen from the notes (cp. my papers in Proc. Soc.
Bibl. Arch., entitled The New Accadian).

David "sat before the Lord " in prayer (2 Sam. vii. 18). This, at least, favours the opinion that sagganakku or sakkanakku meant a priestly rather than a secular personage ; and that when Sargon called himself sagganak

1 The Blackheads were the aboriginal population of Babylonia, i.e. the
Accadians. The Chinese anciently bore the same title, a fact which is
one of the innumerable proofs of their Accadian origin. The meaning appears to be black-haired ; though the expression is said to refer to the
colour of their caps or kerchiefs. The Chinese still call themselves by several synonymous titles meaning the black-haired folk.



CONTRACT-TABLETS RELATING TO BELSHAZZAR
Translated by the Editor
The three contracts which follow are among the
numerous cuneiform documents of the same class the
publication of which we owe to the indefatigable
labours of Dr Strassmaier. They are published in
his Babylonische Texte : Inschriften von Nabonidus,
i., iii., Nos. 184, 581, and 688, and are interesting
on account of their references to Belshazzar, the
eldest son of Nabonidos, whose name is written in
Babylonian Bilu-sarra-utsur, "O Bel, defend the
king." It is especially curious to learn from one of
them that the heir- apparent to the throne had to
conform to the same legal obligations as the meanest
of his subjects. Security was exacted by him for
the payment of a debt, a portion of the security
being a house inhabited by a Persian. As Persian
slaves are mentioned in other deeds of the period it
is possible that the Persian in question was a slave.
At all events the notice of him proves that there were
Persians living in Babylon before the conquest of the
country by Cyrus. The third document, it will be
observed, is dated six years before the overthrow of
Nabonidos and the entrance of Cyrus into Babylon.

REVIEW NOTICES AND OPINIONS OF EMINENT MEN.
It is not too much to say that this is a book that ehould be put into the hands, or better still, into the head of eyery Sunday School teacher and scholar. There is another excellent little book by the
same author, " How we got our Bible," of which we may say the same thing.

Oxford Journal, April 5. From Right Hon. W. B. Gladstone. I find the work itself moat interesting. I have rarely seen the faculty of lucid exposition more conspicuously displayed. From the Professor of Hebrew, Trinity College, Cambridge, A very readable and attractive account of a subject on which I fear very general ignorance prevails.
A thoroughly excellent book is Mr. J. Paterson Smyth's Old
Documents and the Neio Bible. . . . The history of the Bible is a subject on which nearly equal ignorance and curiosity prerail among the people, and Mr. Smyth's book meets a real want.

Scottish Leader, April 10.
. . . . It is a long time since we have come across a book which so thoroughly combined pleasure with profit as the volume uow under description. . . . It is small praise to say that there is not a dull page in it. Of the driest and most unpromising of materials he has constructed a book that anyone can understand, and that most readers will find to contain not only information but amusement. It is a perfect model of what such a book ought to be.
— The Bookseller, April 5.
From Rev. W. Alexandek, D.D., Bishop of Derry. Truly " The Old Documents and the New Bible" is delightful reading. It is pelluoidly arranged and written, sometimes
witty, sometimes pathetic in a high degree. A most instructive book.
It contains a first and easy, yet capital and most indispensable lesson in Biblical criticism, for the understanding of which no long and laborious preliminary studies are necessary. There is scholar,
ship enough in it to make it exceedingly valuable to the young divinity student.

Church Review, May 2.
This little volume is an admirable piece of work by a writer who is evidently thoroughly master of his subject

Glasgow Herald, April 4.
From Eev. Wm. Sanday, Professor of Exegesis, Exeter College, Oxford. Much impressed by the range of knowledge it displays, and by the vigour and clearness with which the subject is presented.

It was in the 29th year of Thothmes III, since line 4 informs us that it happened when the king reached Naharain, and the following campaign (line 13) was directed against Kadesh, which was captured for the first time in the thirtieth year of Thothmes. Amen-em-heb therefore took no part in the battle of Megiddo in the twenty-third year, at which time he was doubtless still very young. Moreover, he did not enter the royal guard at once ; he had first to traverse a considerable distance before he could present to the king, who was in Naharain, the prisoners he had taken in Nekeb. Nekeb is the Negeb or "southern country" of Palestine, frequently mentioned in the Old Testament (see Gen. xiii. i, xx. i; Josh. x. 40, etc.). The course
of events would have been : —The federated Asiatics under the prince of
Kadesh, taught by their recent defeats, seem to have avoided a battle, and fortified themselves in their cities, which had to be besieged one after the other. Hence Thothmes, with the main part of his army, occupied him

PREFACE
Thanks to my contributors, I have this year been
able to redeem my promise of issuing two volumes
of the Records of the Past during the same season.
The monumental records of the ancient oriental
world are so numerous, and so much new material
is continually being brought to light, that it is
difficult for either contributors or editors to keep
pace with the discoveries that are constantly being
made. All we can hope to do is to lay before
the public the most important of the documents
which have thus been rescued from forgetfulness, and
the latest and most authoritative renderings of the
texts.
The latest discovery of interest to the student of
the Old Testament has been announced from Berlin. Among the tablets from Tel el-Amarna which have
been acquired for the Museum at Berlin, five are
found to have been despatches sent from the king
or governor of Jerusalem to the kings of Egypt. I
had already recognised the name of Uru'salim or
" Jerusalem " in a tablet now in Cairo {Academy,
19th April 1890, p. 273); the tablets at Berlin



PREFACE
give us further and unexpected information in regard
to the later capital of the Judsean kingdom. In the
fifteenth century before our era Jerusalem was
governed by a certain Abdi-dhaba, or Ebed-tob as
his name would have been written in Hebrew ; and
it is his letters which have just been deciphered by
the German Assyriologists. He claims to have
occupied a more independent position than the
governors of the other cities of Palestine at the time.
They were merely Egyptian oiificials, whereas he, though owning allegiance to the Egyptian monarch,
claims to have been appointed to his office by " the
oracle of the mighty king." This "mighty king" is
shown by one of the despatches to have been the
deity who was worshipped at Jerusalem. Abdi
dhaba, accordingly, must have been a priest-king
like Melchizedek, " the priest of the most high God."
A broken tablet which I copied in M. Bouriant's
collection tells us what was the local name of the
deity in question. Here we read : al sad Uru'salim
KI al bit AN NIN-IP : sumu Mar-ruv al sarri padarat
asar nisi al Kilti-Kl, " the city of the Mountain of
Jerusalem, the city of the temple of the god Uras,
(whose) name (there is) Marru, the city of the king,
defending (}) the locality of the men of the city ot
Keilah." Consequently " the most high God," of
whom Abram was blessed, was locally known under
the name of Marru, which seems to be connected
with the Aramaic mare, " lord," and was identified
with the Babylonian Uras, the Eastern Sun. It is



PREFACE
possible that the name of the god may throw light
on that of Moriah, " the mountain " on which his
sanctuary was erected.
Abdi-dhaba describes himself as having had
dealings with the Kassi or Babylonians, and in one
of his letters he says : " so long as a ship crosses the
sea—this is the oracle of the mighty king—so long
shall there be a continuance of the conquests of
Nahrima and the Babylonians." Nahrima represents
the Aram Naharaim of Scripture, and it is interesting
to find that the conquests of a king of that country
were known and feared in southern Palestine a
hundred years before Israel was oppressed by
Chushan-rish-athaim, the king of Aram Naharaim
(Judg. iii. 8-io). The mention of the Babylonians is
also interesting since Manetho avers that when the
Hyksos were expelled from Egypt they built Jerusa
lem as a defence against the " Assyrians." In the
age of Manetho " Assyrians " and " Babylonians " were synonymous terms.
While we are thus learning the inner history of
Palestine in the century before the Israelitish
invasion, the history of the fall of the Assyrian
empire, late as it comparatively is in time, is still
shrouded in obscurity. Two new facts only have
been acquired of recent years in regard to it. One
is that the Assyrian king whose name was doubtfully
restored as [Bel-sum-]iskun was really called Sin-sar
iskun ; the other is that Assur-etil-il^ni-yukinni, the
son and successor of Assur-bani-pal, was acknow



viii PREFACE
ledged in northern Babylonia as late as the 4th year
of his reign, tablets of that date having been found
at Niffer by the American expedition. Since Sin
sar-iskun seems evidently to be the Sarakos of
Abydenos and Alexander Polyhistor, we must regard
him as the last king of Assyria, of whom it was said
that he had burnt himself to death in his palace.
But between Assur-etil-ilini-yukinni and Sin-sar
iskun it would appear that there was at least one
king, possibly two. A tablet (K 195) was discovered
by Mr. George Smith from which he translates the
following passage : " Sin-inadina-pal son of Assur
akh-iddin (Esar-haddon), king of Assyria, whose
name on this tablet is inscribed, to the government
in the earth, in the presence of thy great divinity
Shamas great lord, he is proclaimed and established."^
The name of Sin-inadina-pal, or rather Sin-iddina
pal, reminds us of the classical Sardanapallos, and
the tablet on which his name occurs belongs to a
peculiar group, distinguished from all others in the
Kouyunyik collection by their style of writing and
expression. They begin with the words : " O Sun
god, great lord, I beseech thee ; remove (our) sin."
Two tablets of this group (K 4668 and S 2005)
were published by myself for the first time in 1877,
in the Appendix to my Babylonian Literature (pp.
78-82).^ I there pointed out that they belong to
the closing days of the Assyrian Empire, and that

the Esar-haddon mentioned in them must be a later
king than the Esar-haddon otherwise known to
history. I have since seen no reason to change my
opinion. Before examining their contents, however,
it is as well to translate such portions of them as
give a continuous sense.

The rest of the tablet is too broken for trans
lation, but mention is again made in it of " Mamiti

Medes," and we are told that the city of Zaz was
captured. Reference jg alg<-« marlp in tVip t-ahl ptc tn



PREFACE XI
the city of 'Sandu-litir and the 'Saparda or Sepharad
of Obadiah (20), as well as to the fact that the
enemy had " entered the city of Kilman."
The language of the tablets is not that of a
powerful conqueror like Esar-haddon the son of
Sennacherib. Moreover, the historical situation
presupposed by them does not suit the history of
his reign. He defeated the Gimirra on the northern
frontier of his kingdom and drove them to the west.
Their leader was Teuspa, not Kastarit, and he is
called a Manda or " nomad." The Gimirra, further
more, who were led by Teuspa, were not in alliance
with the Medes or with any other of the populations
of the north. The war of Esar-haddon with the
Medes did not take place until long after the defeat
of the Kimmerians, and so far were the Medes from
being the aggressors that it was Esar-haddon who
invaded their territory in the distant east. The
Medes, in fact, were not yet in contact with the
frontiers of Assyria. Finally, their leader was not
Mamiti-arsu. The " city-lords " who were attacked
and subjected by Esar-haddon bore the names of
Sidirparna, Eparna, Uppiz, Zana'sana, and Ramateya.
There is a plentiful choice of names here, but that
of Mamiti-arsu does not appear among them.
On the other hand, the confederacy of which
Kastarit was the head strikingly resembles that
which is called upon in the prophecies of Jeremiah
(li. 27, 28) to destroy the empire of Babylon. The
prophet summons the " kingdoms of Ararat, Minni,



PREFACE
and Ashkenaz," and " the kings of the Medes " to
march upon Babylonia. Ararat or Van and Ash
kenaz, the Assyrian Asguza, take the place of
Kastarit and the Gimirra, but otherwise the situation
is the same as that which is represented in the
tablets. It is clear from Jer. 1. 17, li. 34, that the
prophecy was written while Nebuchadrezzar was still
upon the throne of Babylon, and it would follow
that the tablets which depict a similar political
situation cannot belong to a much earlier date.
The Esar-haddon of the tablets, therefore, must
be a later prince than Esar-haddon the father of
Assur-bani-pal. The conclusion is confirmed by a
tablet, published in W. A. /., iii. 16, No. 2, which
has been the subject of a special study by M.
Amiaud.^ It reads as follows : " Order of the
daughter of the king to the lady Assur-sarrat. Now
do not inscribe thy tablet, do not utter thy word,
lest perhaps they say : ' This (is) the mistress of
Serua-edherat, the eldest daughter of the harem of
Assur-etil-ilani-yukinni, the great king, the powerful
king, the king of legions, the king of Assyria.' Yet
thou (art) a mighty princess, the lady of the house
of Assur-bani-pal, the eldest royal son of the harem
of Esar-haddon king of Assyria." It would appear
from these words that the wife of Assur-bani-pal, the
eldest son of Esar-haddon, " king of Assyria," had
attempted to assume authority over the dowager
queen of Assur-etil-ilAni-yukinni. As the latter king
' " Esarhaddon 11 " in The Babylonian and Oriental Record, ii. 9.



PREFACE
was the successor of Assur-bani-pal, it is obvious
that the Esar-haddon referred to in the tablet could
not have been the father of Assur-bani-pal, and that
the Assur-bani-pal whose wife was Assur-sarrat must
have been a different prince from the famous
Assyrian monarch. We must see in him a brother
of Sin-iddina-pal, and it is possible that the Greek
Sardanapallos has originated out of a fusion of the
names of the two brothers Assur-(bani-pal) and
(Sin)-iddina-pal.
However this may be, we must regard the exist
ence of Esar-haddon II as an ascertained fact of
history. Whether he was succeeded by one of his
two sons Sin-iddina-pal and Assur-bani-pal II we
do not know. All that seems clear is that between
Assur-etil-ilani-yukinni, the immediate successor of
Assur-bani-pal, and Sin-sar-iskun the last Assyrian
king there intervened the reign of Esar-haddon II,
and that under him the foes of the empire first
began to gather against it from the north-east. The
king turned for help to the gods and the prophets ;
and the armies that had once made the name of
Assyria terrible throughout the eastern world could
no longer defend the cities they had garrisoned.

THE OFFICIAL LIFE OF AN EGYPTIAN OFFICER, FROM THE TOMB OF AMENEM-HEB AT THEBES
Translated by Philippe Virey
It is to Prof. Ebers that the honour belongs of
having discovered and pubhshed this celebrated
inscription, although Champollion before him had
penetrated into the tomb of Amen-em-heb, of which
he gives a short description in his Notices} under
No. 12. But the description is so summary that no
inscription is noticed as existing in the tomb; nothing
but the indication of the names of the defunct and
his wife, and the mention of the cartouches of
Thothmes III and Amenophis II allows us to affirm that it is really the tomb of Amen-em-heb. The
monument, moreover, was buried in the sand, and
had been completely forgotten when Prof Ebers,
during his stay at Thebes in 1872-73, had the good
fortune to rediscover it. The great historical inscrip
tion contained in it attracted his attention, and he
made a copy of the text, which he published in
1 Page SOS.
VOL. IV B



RECORDS OF THE PAST
1873/ with a translation and interesting notes. My
predecessors have already acknowledged the merits
of this translation,^ which can be appreciated by
every Egyptologist. In my turn, I shall insist on
the excellence of the copy, and I believe that I
possess special qualifications for delivering such a
judgment. Having myself had to transcribe all the
texts in the tomb of Amen-em-heb,^ I know well
what difficulties Prof. Ebers has victoriously sur
mounted, and can recognise with what patience and
sagacity he has made out the most obscure passages
in a way that admits of no doubt, saving me from
painful efforts and perhaps from unsuccessful con
jectures.
If I now attempt to publish a new rendering of
an inscription already translated by the masters of
Egyptological science, it is that I wish to add a little
sheaf of my own to the abundant harvest of facts
collected at once by Prof. Ebers, and to put for
ward some new ideas derived from the study of
other parts of the tomb of Amen-em-heb as well as
of a neighbouring tomb belonging to an official of
the same rank"* as himself, entitled tennu n suten
te7inu n menfiu {" vicar of the king in the army," or
substantially a minister of war). The great inscrip

tion tells us in the first place what were the glorious
services by which Amen-em-heb rose to so high a
dignity.
What was the exact signification of his title ?
The word tennii, which Dr. Brugsch has carefully
examined in the Revue ^gyptologiqiie} does not always
signify a minister in the sense in which we ordinarily
understand the word ; but I hope to show that it
certainly has this meaning in our inscription. It
properly signifies, as 'Dr. Brugsch has pointed out,
" a deputy," " a delegate," " a vicar." Prof. Maspero,
in his Manuel de HitrarcJiie igyptienne^ explains that
the military chief of a nome had at his side a tennu
of the troops, a lieutenant of the forces, who could
act in his place, more particularly, as his title indi
cates, at the head of the troops who were in service,
but probably also in the offices of the administration.
The tennu or vicar of a military officer will therefore
be his lieutenant ; the tenmi or vicar of the governor
of a city will be an assistant governor ; the tetinu
or vicar of the Chancellor ^ will perhaps be an under
secretary of state ; but the vicar of the king will be
a minister. I have elsewhere * come to the conclusion
that the tenmc of the troops, who in the provinces
was only a sort of administrative officer or military
intendant, was at Thebes, under the title of tennu n

suten} the deputy of the king, an actual minister of
war. We see from the paintings which represent
the conscription that he received recruits from all
countries ; in the tomb of Pehsukher many of them
are Nubians and negroes. It was then the royal
army which was administered by this functionary,
but the royal army with the auxiliaries as distinct
from the provincial contingents. In the different
inscriptions of the tomb Amen-em-heb is further
distinguished by a series of titles, all of which are
thoroughly applicable to a minister of the king. But
the most conclusive example is found in line 46
of our inscription, where the king says to Amen-em
heb : " Advance in dignity ; be tennu of the army
and from the moment that this is said, watch over
the royal forces." These words can have been addressed only to a minister ; the meaning of
" military intendant " is impossible here, for Amen
em-heb was already in command of the royal guard
when the king appointed him tennu, saying to him,
" Advance in dignity." It would not have been an
advancement for the commander of the guard to be
appointed military intendant. I should add that Dr.
Brugsch sees in the tennu or aten " of the world
and " of the two worlds " a sort of viceroy of Egypt
or prime minister of the Pharaoh, and that Chabas
remarks that there were atennu of foreign countries,
of the treasury, and of the private house of the

Pharaoh :
'' We recognise among them ministers of
protected states, of finance, etc." The tenim Malm,
who was charged with the installation of Amen-em
heb,^ was perhaps one of these ministers, but the
text does not state what was the department which
he administered. Sometimes, moreover, we find the
terms tenmi n suten, tenmc n hon-f (" minister of the
king," " minister of his majesty,"), without any further
explanation.
In his new office Amen-em-heb superintended
the recruiting of the army as well as its discipline
and instruction. Several of the scenes depicted on
the walls of his tomb represent him in the exercise
of these functions. We notice among them a docu
ment which gives us a high idea of the organisation
of the Egyptian troops, and enables us to understand
their superiority to the hordes of Asia. " Behold the
arm of Egypt," ^ says Amen-em-heb to the king,
pointing out to him at the same time the officers
who defiled before him : " behold the numerous force
which is under thy hand. We form a complete
whole, having but one mouth, one arm, one hand,
all of us, the soldiers [keeping their ranks (i*)],^ and
none quitting them."
The maintenance of the troops, accordingly, de
pended on the superior direction of the tennu. We
see him presenting the officers of the commissariat
to the king. " He causes the officers of the adminis

tration of the army, the officers of the commissariat,
to march past before the Pharaoh, in order that the
sacks may be filled with provisions, bread, beef,
wine, biscuits, all sorts of vegetables, and all good
things."
The tomb of Pehsukher shows us even the opera
tions of harvest, in districts doubtless appropriated
to the maintenance of the army, and sets before us
a scene representing the inspection of the magazines
of food. A clerk sums up the amount, and certain
officers taste the quality of the provisions. The
tennii thus has at his disposal a numerous adminis
trative staff, and is at the same time at the head of
the army. The officers who presented themselves
before him were first of all received by the " scribe
of the writings or the secretary of the tennu." And
in a transport of pride the latter exclaimed: "There
is none greater than myself! There is none greater
than myself !
" ' thus asserting that he held the first
rank among men, and next to the monarch who
represented the divinity, and whose minister he con
sequently was.

have interfered with his operations to look to their own defence, and prevented others from joining in the revolt. Amen-em-heb was in one of these columns, and consequently his first exploits in the countries of Nekeb, Uan, and Carchemish took place at a distance from the king.
' The Aram-Naharaim, or Aram of the two rivers, of the Old Testa
ment (Judges iii. 8), placed by Prof. Maspero between the Euphrates and
the Orontes. [The tablets of Tel el-Amarna, however, show that the chief seat of the king of Naharain was on the eastern bank of the Euphrates, opposite Carchemish, as they identify the Naharain of the Egyptian monuments with the country of Mitanni, whose position is known from the
Assyrian inscriptions. —Ed. ]

The expedition probably took place while Thothmes was besieging Aleppo. Help might have been sent to Aleppo from the land of the Hittites on the north-west, which would explain the despatch of an Egyptian force in this direction.
^ Or perhaps " heads " or "beings," equivalent to sa ("human being "). ' Doubtless during the siege of Aleppo, to which Carchemish was near. [Carchemish, the Hittite capital, was situated on the western bank of the Euphrates, a Uttle to the north of its junction with the Sajur, and is now represented by the mounds of Jerabllis, from which Hittite sculptures and inscriptions have been brought to the British IWuseum.

Thothmes spread terror by the suddenness of his appearance in the most distant quarters.

I cut off its tail [and] made of it a trophy 1** 28. in the royal work of giving thanks to God because thereof.^^ That caused joy to take possession of my heart [and] cheerfulness to alight upon my limbs.^^

" Literally " I was hurrying myself against it." ^^ Literally " I arranged it." ^' Probably the mare had caused confusion in the Egyptian ranks, so that the king gave thanks to God for deliverance from peril. ^^ These events occurred in the forty-second year of the reign of Thothmes IH. The prince of Kadesh, whose capital had already been captured (Unes 13-14) in the thirtieth year of his reign, and its walls razed, had revolted after having rebuilt his fortifications.

to have broken out at the time among the desert tribes, who are Ukened to the race of Set or Typhon, the god of aridity. ^ The result of the comparison between the new king and the rising sun. * This is represented in three pictures below the inscription. The upper picture shows us, according to the epigraph, "all the princes of Upper RuTENNU, who proclaim ; Great are thy desires ; thou puttest fear in all the double land (of Egypt), and all [foreign lands are] under thy sandals." One prince is prostrate ; two others, on their knees, extend their arms in supplication ; a fourth, standing, presents a vase ; a fifth,
also standing, offers suppliantly a small child whom he holds in his arms ;
another child is in front of him. A si.xtli chief also brings a child. Other persons follow of different physiognomies and head-dresses ; but owing to the mutilation of the wall the end of the scene is indistinct. In the second
picture are "all the chiefs of Lower RuTENNU ; " but the scene represented in it does not diffei- from that of the first picture. The legend attached to
the third picture is almost entirely effaced. A person is represented in it prostrate and accompanied by three others who are kneeling, and two more who carry vases of various forms. Beyond this tlie wall is mutilated. ^ As had been the case under Thothmes. Amen-em-heb means that he preserved his old functions.

HYMN TO OSIRIS ON THE STELE OF AMON-EM-HA
Translated by D. Mallet
This hymn to Osiris is engraved on a semi-circular
stele of limestone which forms part of the collection
of the Biblioth^que Nationale at Paris. It comprises
28 lines of hieroglyphics, in a very good state of
preservation, excepting only that the name of the
god Amon, which once figured in several proper
names, has been carefully chiselled out, in the age of
the so-called heretic kings Khu-n-Aten (Amenophis
IV) and his successors.
The text may have been sculptured on the stele
in the time of the eighteenth dynasty—Chabas has
remarked that the wife of Amon-mes, the father of
Amon-em-ha, bore the same name as the favourite
wife of Amenophis I —but it reproduces a religious
work of more ancient date, which goes back at least
to the epoch of the twelfth dynasty, as is shown on
the one hand by the small number of determinatives
and on the other by the use of certain formulae, e.g.
the position of the father's name before that of the
son : " Osiris son Horus " in the sense of " Horus



HYMN TO OSIRIS 15
son of Osiris." The references of the monument to
the cult of Osiris are consequently very ancient, and
they thus possess all the greater importance for the
history of the Egyptian religion.
The text has been reproduced for the first time
and translated by Chabas in the Revue avcheologique
(May-June 1857), from a squeeze furnished him by
Deveria. Chabas published a new translation, which
differed considerably from the first, in the first series
of Records of the Past, vol. vi. pp. 99 sqq.
The semicircular part of the stele is divided into
two compartments. At the top is the ring in the
form of a seal, accompanied by the two sacred eyes.
The first compartment includes two scenes of un
equal importance. On the left, Amon-em-ha pre
sents the table of offerings, filled with provisions of
all sorts, to his father and mother, seated side by
side in a large armchair, the wife resting the left
hand, as usual, on the shoulder of her husband.
Behind the chair is a child, with a long lock of hair,
who puts his left hand to his mouth and holds
a flower in the right. Behind him runs a vertical
inscription : " His son Amon-em-ua." Above the
two seated personages we read : " The superintend
ent of the oxen Amon-mes ; his wife, the mistress of
the house, Nofri-t-ari." Above the table of offerings
is : " His son Amon-em-ha." On the right, a person
clothed in a panther's skin, the characteristic garb of
the priests, presents a seated lady, "the mistress Baki-t,
deceased "— doubtless another wife of Amon-mes

with an incense-burner which has a long handle like
an arm, while with the other hand he pours out a
libation of water over a double altar, and the legend
engraved before him runs : " The Khri-heb of Osiris,
the son, comes."
The second compartment is occupied by a series
of six kneeling persons, whose faces are turned to
the right ; their names are engraved in a vertical
direction in front of each of them :—" His son Si-t
Maut ; his son Amon-ken ; his daughter Meri-t ; his daughter Amon-bai-t ; his daughter Suten-Maut
his daughter Hui-em-nuter."
Next comes the hymn itself, which occupies the
rest of the stele.



HYMN TO OSIRIS
1. Adoration to Osiris by the superintendent of the oxen, Amon-em-ha son of the lady Nofri-t-ari. He says : Homage to thee, Osiris, lord of eternity, king of the gods with the thousand names,^ with the sacred existences,^ with the secret acts ^ in the temples ; he is rich in Ka * in Tattu,^ holding property ** 2. in SoKHEM,'' master of the sacred dances^ in Busiris, prince of abundance ^ in On,!" master of remembrance in Mati,ii hidden soul, master of Kerer,i^ venerated in the Memphite nome ^'^ the soul whose body itself is Ra, who reposes in
^ Compare the epithet '
' with a myriad of names " often applied to Isis
by the Greeks (Plutarch : de Isid. et Osirid. 53). A Greek inscription in the Louvre (No. i) calls her " many-named." The same expression is used of Anion. - Kheperu is usually translated here "transformations." But Osiris is never transformed and khoper merely signifies " to be " or " become. ^ Ar-u or ir-u has no determinative ; it appears to refer to the ceremonies performed in the temples rather than to the forms of the god. ^ The Ka is the double of the individual ; the gods and sometimes
men themselves have several ; at Mendes Osiris doubtless had quite a series of them inherent in his sacred statues. ^ Mendes. ^ Or perhaps, '

THE SYNCHRONOUS HISTORY OF ASSYRIA AND BABYLONIA
Translated by the Editor
The so-called Synchronous History of Assyria and
Babylonia has been translated in part by myself in
the former series of Records of tJie Past, iii. pp.
29-36. I see no reason for changing the translation
given there ; but as several new fragments of the
history have been discovered since its publication, it
is necessary that the document as we now have it
should be placed before the reader. Its historical
importance is considerable ; not only are kings of
Assyria and Babylonia mentioned in it with whose
names we are otherwise unacquainted, but the order
in which they occur, as well as their contemporaneity,
is our only guide towards settling the chronology of
the earlier period of Assyrian history.
A translation of the document has lately been
published by Dr. Peiser and Dr. Winckler in the
Keilinsckrifiliche Bibliothek,!. p'[>. 194-203. They are
doubtless right in holding that it is not a history in
the proper sense of the word, but a historical retro
spect of the arrangements made by the Assyrian

and Babylonian kings in regard to the disputed
territory which lay between the two kingdoms. It
formed part, in fact, of a legal statement of the case
made on behalf of Assyria in the time of one of the
immediate successors of Rimmon-nirari III. Hence
the absence of dates which characterises it, as well
as its reference only to those monarchs who in war
or peace concerned themselves with the territory in
question. The recently discovered tablets of Tel el
Amarna contain letters from Assur-yuballidh of
Assyria and Burna-buryas of Babylonia to the
Egyptian king, and they further show that the
immediate predecessor of Burna-buryas was not
Kara-indas but Ris-takullima-Sin. Since Shalman
eser I., whose date is fixed by an inscription of
Sennacherib about i 300 B.C. (see Records of the Past,
new series, vol. ii. p. 3, note 2), was the grandson
of Pudil or Pediel, who was himself " the son of
Bel-nirari the son of Assur-yuballidh," we may
consider the last-named to have reigned about
1400 B.C.
The beginning of the document is lost, only the
ends of the first eleven lines being preserved. These
read as follows :

INSCRIPTIONS OF SHALMANESER II
Translated by the Rev. V. Scheil
Shalmaneser, or more correctly Shulmanu-asharidu
II, reigned from 860 to 824 B.C. He was the worthy
successor of his father Assur-natsir-pal. The number
of his years was equal to the number of his wars.
His dominion ended by extending westward as
far as Lebanon and the Mediterranean, northward
over the countries of Ararat, eastward beyond the oriental sea of Nairi, or Lake Urumiyeh, southward
to the left bank of the Euphrates as far as Babylon
and the whole of Chaldaea.
Of other labours besides wars, history has pre
served the memory only of the restoration of the walls
of Calah (Layard's Inscriptions, y6), and the con
struction (or attempt at construction) of a temple
to the Moon-god Sin at Haran {W. A. I., v. 64,
col. ii. 4).
The principal inscriptions of Shalmaneser are
those on an obelisk of black marble, on a monolith
from Kurkh, and on the bronze gates of the temple
of Balawat. They are all now in the British Museum.



INSCRIPTIONS OF SHALMANESER II 37
The obelisk was found at Kouyunjik. Besides
the chief inscription, it has bas-rehefs with epigraphs
attached. The text is published in Layard's Inscrip
tions, 87-98. It has been translated by Oppert (in
his Histoire des Empires de Clialdee et d'Assyrie),
Menant {Annahs des Rois d'Assyrie), Sayce {^Records
of the Past, v. 1st series), and Winckler {Keilin
schriftliclie Bibliothek, i.)
The monolith comes from Kurkh. The text has
been published in W.A.I., iii. 7, 8, and has been trans
lated by Sayce {Records of the Past, iii. 1st series),
Menant {Annates), Craig {Hebraica, iii. 1887), and
Peiser {KeilinschriftlicJie Bibliothek, i.)
The inscription on the gates of Balawat was dis
covered by Mr. Hormuzd Rassam in 1877, and has
been published and translated by Mr. Pinches in the
Transactions of the Society of Biblical Arcliceology, vii.
pp. 83 sqq. A complete edition of the inscriptions of Shal
maneser II has been published by Amiaud and
Scheil. It serves as the basis of the following trans
lations.

THE MONOLITH INSCRIPTION OF SHALMANESER II
Translated by the Rev. V. Scheil.
The inscription of which a translation is here given
is engraved on a monolitli found at Kurkh, and now
in the British Museum. Kurkh, which is probably
the Karkathiokerta of classical geography, is upon
the right bank of the Tigris, about 20 miles to the
south of Diarbekir. The monument was erected to
commemorate the exploits of the Assyrian king,
Shalmaneser II, during the first four and a half years
of his reign (B.C. 858-854). It gives in detail an
account of the campaigns which are briefly noticed
in the annals of the Black Obelisk.
The inscription has been translated by Menant
in the Annales des Rois d'Assyrie (1874), pp. 105
113; by Sayce in the Records of the Past, i st series,
iii. pp. 81-100 (1874) ; by Craig in Hebraica, iii. pp.
20 1 sqq. (1887); and by Peiser in the KeilinschriftlicJie
Bibliothek, i. pp. i 51-175 (1889). The geographical
and historical information contained in it makes it a
peculiarly valuable document, especially when studied
in connection with the inscription of the Black

Obelisk, and the long standard inscription of Assur
natsir-pal. It contains the first mention found in
an Assyrian text of an Israelitish king, and proves
that the death of Ahab could not have taken place
until after B.C. 854.

THE INSCRIPTION OF SHALMANESER II ON THE GATES OF BALAWAT
Translated by the Rev. V. Scheil
In 1877 Mr. Hormuzd Rassam discovered the
remains of some very interesting Assyrian buildings
in a small mound called Balawat, about fifteen miles
to the east of Mosul and nine miles from the mounds
of Nimrfld. They consisted of the enclosure of a
palace, within which was a chapel dedicated to
Makhir, the god of dreams. The temple had been
built and the palace restored by Assur-natsir-pal,
who named the place Imgur-Bel. The palace was
further embellished by Shalmaneser II, the son of
Assur-natsir-pal. ' He furnished it with two folding
gates of great size, each of which was ornamented
with seven horizontal bands of bronze. The bronze
bands not only ran across the faces of the wooden
gates, but also round one side of the bronze posts to
which the gates were attached. The bands are
covered with repouss^ work, representing the various
countries and cities conquered by Shalmaneser in the
course of his campaigns. Each band contains two
lines of such representations ; over each of the



INSCRIPTIONS OF SHALMANESER II 73
pictures is an explanatory inscription, and on either
side of the band is a border of rosettes. The bronze
plates were fastened to the gates by nails driven
through the centre of the rosettes.
The inscriptions, so far as they are still legible,
have been published and translated by Mr. Pinches
in the Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archce
ology, vii. I (1880), and in The Bronze Ornaments of
the Palace Gates of BalawAt (1880-81). The trans
lation which follows will be found to represent the
progress that has been made in Assyrian decipher
ment since the publication of Mr. Pinches.

A VOTIVE INSCRIPTION OF ASSURNATSIR-PAL
Translated by S. Arthur Strong
The following inscription is on a tablet of alabaster,
which, with a duplicate copy, was found in a marble
coffer by Mr. Rassam in the course of his excava
tions at Balaw^t in 1878, and is now in the British
Museum. It begins with the genealogy of Assur
natsir-pal and a short account of his conquering
advance from east to west, from beyond the Tigris
to the Mediterranean, which is repeated almost word
for word from his great inscription. (Col. ii. lines
125-131. See Records of the /'aj^, new series, vol.
ii. p. 161.) The king then records how he recaptured
and brought once more within the sphere of his
dominion a town or fortress, to which he gave the
name Imgur-Bel or "Bel's Delight." The position of
this place, which was not far east of the ancient
Kalah, is now marked by the mound of Balaw^t.
Here he built a temple to Makhir, whom we know
only as the god of dreams, but who doubtless
possessed other and more important attributes and
functions. It was among the ruins of this temple



VOTIVE INSCRIPTION OF ASSUR-NATSIR-PAL 8i
that the coffer containing the tablets was discovered.
The inscription closes with the usual appeal to the
future king to respect the pious memory of his prede
cessor, and to restore the building and replace the
tablet in the event of their removal or decay. To
him who shall thus act the blessing of Assur is
promised ; while, on the other hand, the curse of
Ishtar is invoked upon him who, with the tablet in
view, should insult the memory of Assur-natsir-pal.
This work of construction and restoration at Imgur
Bel, left unfinished by the great king at his death in
858 B.C., was taken up and completed by his son and
successor, a ruler of kindred spirit, Shalmaneser II.
The tablets are in a state of good preservation,
and the writing is regular and clear. They are
remarkable for the use made throughout by the
scribe of vertical lines of division between words or
groups of words, thus :
Assur-natsir-pal | sarru rab-ii | sarru dan-nu \
sar kissati sar Assur
|
Instances of such a use of dividing - lines are
extremely rare in Assyrian inscriptions, whereas on
the Persian cuneiform monuments the words are
invariably separated, but by a wedge placed diagon
ally.
The lid of the coffer in which this text was found
bears a somewhat defaced inscription of the same
character, which, however, ends, with the words of
line 40 of the present translation. VOL. IV G

INSCRIPTION OF RIMMON-NIRARI III
Translated by S. Arthur Strong
The following inscription is on a pavement slab
found at Nimrud, the ancient Calah, and now in the
British Museum. It has been published in the iirst
volume of The Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western
Asia, p. 35, No. 3, as well as (from an incomplete
duplicate) by Layard on p. 70 of his volume of
Cuneiform Inscriptions, and Bonomi in his work on
Nineveh, p. 339. It has been translated by Sayce
in the first volume of the former series of Records of
the Past, and (into German) by Abel in the first
volume of Schrader's KeilinschriftUche Bibliothek.
It contains the genealogy of Rimmon-nirari III,
whose reign lasted from 811 to 7 8 3 B.C., during
which time he was ceaselessly occupied in consolidating
and extending the conquests of his predecessors. In
fact, on the eponym list for this period there is not
a single year not marked by a campaign. Among
other exploits he subdued Damascus, and forced its
king to pay tribute. His empire extended from the
borders of Elam on the south-east to the Mediter
ranean on the west, and included as vassal -states



INSCRIPTION OF RIMMON-NIRARI III 87
Tyre, Sidon, Edom, Philistia, and Israel. After his
death the Assyrian power of the first epoch, having
reached its furthest Hmits, began to dechne.
One of the most striking events of his reign was
the revival in Assyria of the worship of Nebo. The
latter had not been unknown to the Assyrians, but
his cult was not so important with them as with the
Babylonians, as is shown by the fact that up to the
time of Rimmon-nirari his name rarely enters into
the composition of proper names. Rimmon-nirari
built a new temple for him at Calah, which, as we learn
from the eponym list, he entered in the year 787.
From the concluding words of the inscription on
the statue of Nebo in the British Museum ( W. A. I.,
35, 2) it might even appear as if it had been intended
that the worship of Nebo should dominate, or actu
ally supersede, that of all other gods ; " Put thy
trust in Nebo ; trust in no other god !
'' But if this
was the project, it was not successful.
The inscription here translated is remarkable from
the fact that Rimmon-nirari, after tracing his descent
back to his great-grandfather, Assur-natsir-pal, begins
again, as it were, at a point still more remote, and
boasts himself the descendant of Tiglath-adar, son of
Shalmaneser I., behind whom again there stand the
mysterious forms of the otherwise unknown Belkap
kapi and 'Sulili.
But the rendering of the latter part of the inscrip
tion is put forward only provisionally, to be contra
dicted or confirmed by future researches.

1 E-kharsak-Kurkurra is here the name of a temple, but it had also, and originally, a cosmical meaning as applied to the world-mountain
that is, to the world conceived as a mountain. And the idea of a worldmountain seems to have passed into that of a mountain in the world, or on the earth, which, as the abode of the gods, recalls the Indian Meru. See Jensen. Kosmologie der Babylonier, pp. 201-205.



VOTIVE INSCRIPTIONS
Translated by S. Arthur Strong
The following inscription is on a stone lion found
at the entrance of a temple at the foot of the
pyramid at Nimrud, and now in the British Museum.
It is an invocation to Beltis, the female counterpart
or shadow of Bel, and forms an introduction to one
of the frequent versions of the standard inscription
of Assur-natsir-pal. In line 7 Ishtar, though she
appears to be invoked as a separate goddess, is
probably to be regarded as an equivalent or personi
fication of Beltis. However, the process by which
she assumed the titles, and eventually absorbed the
personality of the latter, was a gradual one, and its
final stage becomes visible only in inscriptions of
the second Assyrian period, particularly in those of
Assurbanipal.^
The inscription has been published in the second
volume of " The Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western
Asia," plate 66, No. i. Lines 7 to 9 have been
translated by Zimmern in Babylonische Busspsalmen,

be found on pp. 197 and 256 of Jensen's KosDwlogie

The lines as they are given in W. A. I., ii. do not
represent the arrangement of the original, but I
follow them for convenience of reference.
INVOCATION TO THE GODDESS BELTIS
1. To Beltis, the great lady, chief of heaven and earth, queen of all the gods, the mighty one 2. of all lands, whose festival is honoured among the ISHTARS, who surpasses in power her offspring, a shining form, 3. who, hke the sun her brother, the ends of heaven and earth together enlightens, the strong one of the Anunnaki,^ 4. first-born of Anu, great one of the gods, queen over her enemies, who goes before, troubler of the seas, 5. who tramples the wooded mountains under foot,^ the mighty one of the Igigi, lady of fight and battle,^ without whom in E-sarra the sceptre 6. they would not obey, who causes to receive strength,
1 The spirits of the under world opposed to Igigi, the spirits of the upper air.
2 In an inscription of Assur-natsir-pal on a small altar brought from
Balawat by Mr. Rassam, and numbered 71 in the Nimrud Gallery of the
British Museum, the same epithet is applied to Bel. Ana Beli

In the following inscription Assur-bani-pal com
memorates the revolt of Elam and its final sup
pression (after 648 B.C.), as well as certain repairs
or alterations which he carried out in the temple of
Ishtar of Nineveh, to whom are gratefully ascribed
both the inspiration and the merit of his victorious
campaigns.
The reference to the fate of Teumman's succes
sors is not altogether clear, though Tiele {Babylonisch
Assyrische Geschichte, ii. 399) is probably right in
explaining it as an allusion to the triumphal pro
gress of Assur-bani-pal to the gate of the temple of
Ishtar in a chariot drawn by the four conquered
kings. See W. A. /., v. 10, 29. But in that case
the introduction of Ummanigas must be due to an
error, for he was killed by his son, Tammaritu, long
before the end of the Elamite war, which this
barbaric triumph of Assur-bani-pal was intended to
celebrate (Smith, History of Assurbanipal, p. 202).
* Or, "who causes to attain the heart's desire of him," etc.

And, as we learn from W. A. I., v. 10, it was the
Arabian King Vaiteh, who, together with the three
Elamite princes mentioned in our inscription, was
compelled to draw the car of Assur-bani-pal.
The inscription appears to have been frequently
copied and widely circulated. Four versions are
preserved in the British Museum (Nos. 62, 63, 64,
65), and a fifth was discovered at Tartus (the
ancient Antarados) in 1885, of which the text, with
a translation, was communicated by Professor Sayce to the Society of Biblical Archaeology, and published
in their Proceedings (vii. 142). It has further
been published and translated by George Smith
(History of Assurbp., p. 303), and S. A. Smith
{Keilschriftexte Asurbanipals, ii. 10), while a Ger
man version by Jensen will be found on p. 264 of
the second volume of Schrader's Keilinschriftliche
Bibliothek}

1 The text wiU be found in the second volume of W. A. I., plate 66,
No. 2 ; but the arrangement of the present translation is different, being that of No. 64, as edited by S. A. Smith. 2 It is uncertain whether the name of this temple should be read
E-barbar or E-masmas, and the meaning of the name is also obscure.
However, in W. A. /., ii. 48, 26, barbar (or masmas)\i explained by the
Assyrian phrase kis-su sa mu-sa-ri-e, which is interpreted to mean
"library" (Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, p. 149), in which case E-barbar
would be "the temple of the library." The original meaning of mu'sarH
seems to have been "furrow" ; cp, W. A. /. , iv. 27, i : bi-i-nu sa ina
mu-'sa-ri-e me-e Id is-tu-u ("seed which in the furrows drinks not
water "). Hence, through the idea of what is traced or indented, it comes
to mean an inscribed character, an inscription. The temple in question is
the temple of Ishtar at Nineveh, which was also restored by Assur-natsirpal. See W. A. /., iii. 3, 40.

The foUowfing is a translation of the inscription
of Assur-natsir-pal referred to in II, note 2. It
establishes the identification of Beltis with Ishtar of
Nineveh, and also records the fact that " the temple

Samsi-Rimmon. Two inscriptions and two only of

BABYLONIAN CONTRACT-TABLETS WITH HISTORICAL REFERENCES
By Theo. G. Pinches
As it is naturally rare to find contract-tablets with
historical references, and as, when such are found,
they possess contemporaneous authority on account
of their referring to events acknowledged to have
taken place, or conditions known to exist, either at
or shortly before the date of the document recording
them, it is manifest that such documents must be of
special interest and unimpeachable trustworthiness.
For this reason it has been thought well to collect
here a few of the more noteworthy of these import
ant texts—texts which have an additional value in
that they do not refer to events touched upon in any
known history, though it is possible that references
to some of them may be found hereafter.

VOL. IV H



98 RECORDS OF THE PAST
It was in the year 648 B.C. Samas-sum-ukin or
Saosduchinos had been on the throne of Babylonia,
under the suzerainty of his brother, Assur-bani-apli,
for 19 years, and the end of his rule, and his own
tragic death, were nearing. The Assyrian army,
sent by his brother, was probably at that time over
running the land, and destroying everything wherever
they passed. Hence were the people overtaken by
want and misery, such as often happened to them in
those days. If we want to know how the Babylonians
behaved towards each other during this trying time,
the tablet here translated depicts it to us clearly, and
it is a picture worthy of consideration. Remut, a
man probably richer and more fortunate than his
neighbours, lends a sum of money which was hardly
to be considered small (f^ths of a mana= 50 shekels)
to Mus^zib-Marduk and Kulla, his wife, without
interest (for none is mentioned). This money is
lent, not for a week or a month, but imtil the land

is yet a third possibility, namely, that the characters
are quite correctly read, but that the final ma is the
well-known enclitic particle. If this be the case, we
must read " At this time, in the city of Lami also,
there is want and famine in the land." After the
word makale there is a small piece of the tablet
broken away, but this seems to have contained no
word of importance, if, indeed, it was inscribed at all.
II. —A Testimony to Babylonian Overlordship IN Tyre
THE GOVERNOR OF KADESH MAKES A PLEDGE WITH REGARD TO SOME CATTLE
This little text, which is an ordinary contract
tablet of unbaked clay, is important not only as
giving the date of the Babylonian dominion so far
from Babylonia, but also for the names, some of which
are clearly Phoenician. The text is slightly damaged,
but the wanting characters can, in every case, be
restored with perfect certainty. The number is

On the isth day of the month lyyar, Milki-idiri, Governor of Kidis, will get three cows and their young, and will give them to Abia, son of Nadin-akhi, descendant of the priest of the Sungod. If he cannot get (them), Milki-idiri will give to Abla, son of Nadin-akhi, son of the priest of the Sungod, 5 mana of silver.

The cause of Milki-idiri taking the obligation
here recorded upon himself it is unfortunately im
possible to determine. Judging, however, from the
fact that it is cattle that are given, and that only in
event of inability to get the animals money was to
be substituted, it may be inferred that he entered
into the obligation by way of compensating Abla
for a loss for which he was in some way responsible.
The contract gave Milki-idiri nearly ten months in
which to discharge the obligation (2 2d of Tammuz,
or June-July, to the 15th of lyyar, or April-May).
Special interest centres in the name of the princi
pal contracting party, Milki-idiri, Governor of Kidis.
His name forms an analogy with that of Ben-Hadad,
whose full name was Ben-Hadad-hidri, the meaning
of which, as I have elsewhere remarked,^ was prob
ably "The Son of Hadad (is) my glory." ^ The

BABYLONIAN CONTRACT TABLETS lol
most likely meaning of Milki-idiri ( = Melech-heder(i)
or Melek-hidri) is therefore " Molech (is) my glory."
As for the name of the place of which he was
governor, Kidis ^ (which was probably pronounced
Kedes or Kedesh), this is undoubtedly Kedesh
(Kadesh), on the lake of Homs, a site of consider
able interest, in that it was the scene of a conflict
between Ramses II and the Kheta or Hittites, and
is supposed to be mentioned in 2 Samuel xxiv. 6,
under the name of Takhtim Khodshi, in the neigh
bourhood of Tyre and Sidon.^
All the other personal names in this text are
Babylonian, though it is possible that at least some
of the people who bore them were not Babylonians.
About the beginning of July, therefore, in the
year 564 B.C., Melek-hidri, Governor of Kadesh,
visited Tyre for the purpose of attending to his
affairs.

This tablet is one of the class of wedding-contracts,
and is unfortunately only a fragment. Such as it is,
the Greek form Ader arises from a simple (and easy) interchange of the
letters d and ?-, or from the fact that the last element of the name was
heder (or hidri).
1 As I have elsewhere pointed out, Qoph changes into Kaph m Assyrian before e and i, hence Kidis (Kedes) for Qidis (Qedes).

less be regarded as tolerably certain that Neriglissar
did give his daughter Gigitum in marriage to Nabu
sum-ukin ; for, had it been otherwise, there would
have been no need for this document, the importance
attached to which may be gathered from the fact
that more than one copy was made, the text pre
served in the British Museum being that belonging
to the temple (E-zida, the Birs-Nimroud) of which
Nabu-sum-ukin was high-priest and director.
As will be seen from the translation, Nabu-sumukin does not use any pronoun when making his
request known to Neriglissar. He merely says,
" Give Gigitum, thy virgin daughter, to wifehood,
and let her be a wife," or " the wife." An examina
tion of texts of a similar class shows that this was
the customary formula. The word for " wife " is
written with the usual ideogram, and is unaccom
panied by any pronoun. A similar text in the
Liverpool Museum, however, spells the word out,
and gives the same form, assati, as is transcribed in
the present article. It is possible, therefore, that
this terminal -i was always understood and read as
the possessive pronoun of the first person, even
when not written. Other examples of this gram
matical usage exist.
The remainder of the tablet was probably taken
up with the usual conditions —the penalty on Nabu
sum-ukin if he should divorce or abandon his wife ;
the penalty on Gigitum if she should disown or
forsake her husband ; directions with regard to the



I04 RECORDS OF THE PAST
amount and disposal of her dowry, etc. It is here
to be noted that Herodotus was probably wrongly
informed with regard to the compulsory nature of
the public prostitution of unmarried women practised
in ancient Babylonia, for the expressions found in
these tablets point, sometimes, as in the present case,
to a belief, on the part of the bridegroom, in the
chastity of the woman chosen by him to be his
wife.
Doubtless the priesthood of Babylon were highly
elated that one of their number had allied himself
by marriage with the royal family of Babylon, for
this must have added greatly to their prestige and
influence at the time. The date is March-April, the
Babylonian New-Year's Day, 560 B.C.

This text, which is rather mutilated, is an ordinary
sale-tablet. Its importance, however, will be easily
seen, for it is seldom that records of battles and
warlike expeditions are to be found on contract
tablets. It is therefore one of the most interesting
tablets of its class, and even the names of the
witnesses possess a special value. The tablet is
composed of three fragments, which were found by
me to join some years ago. The number is 82-9-18, 4215 4-4226.

I06 RECORDS OF THE PAS7
One of the important points concerning this
text is that, by the tenth year of Darius, five battles
had been fought with a Bactrian tribe ; and it is
not unliJ<ely that Sa-Nab(i-duppu acquired Nan^
silim (the unfortunate woman had received a Baby
lonian name, in accordance with the custom of the
time) from the daughter of the man who captured
her, namely, Sin-edhir. The remainder of the con
tract proper is of the usual kind, and refers, like
many others, to the taking of a duty or responsibility
by one of the contracting parties (in this case the
son of the seller), to guarantee the buyer against
any claim hereafter on the part of the seller, his
kinsfolk, or the king.
In my first rendering I read the name of the slave
as Nana-khusi ; and Khupiri (which I regarded as
the name of a Bactrian tribe) instead of sipiri.
Noting, however, that the klui in Akhume (see the
list of witnesses) was differently formed, it now seems
to me better to read these words as Nana-silim and
sipiri, which readings I have adopted here. The
sipiri was a Babylonian official attached to the house
hold of the king and princes of the blood. From
our text it would seem that this official also con
ducted military expeditions, at least in Persian times.
What is the meaning of the word diirsu, against
which the sipiri seems to have gone, is uncertain.
There is no determinative prefix or suffix indicating
that it is the name either of a person, a place, or a
river, though something of the kind might be expected.



BABYLONIAN CONTRACT TABLETS 107
Another point of interest is the names. Issar
taribi, the buyer, a well-known tradesman of the
time when the tablet was drawn up/ bears one of
the most interesting. About the first element, Issar,
there is some uncertainty, as it sometimes appears
as Istar.^ This name apparently means " The god
dess Issar (Istar) has made increase." His father's
name, Mur-epus, means " the windgod has made " or
"created," Mur^ being one of the names of the windgod Rammanu or Addu (Rimmon or Hadad). To many, however, the two witnesses, Gamar-yawa
(Gamar-Jahwa, "Jehovah has perfected" = Gamariah),
and Barikia (" Jah has blessed " = Berechiah), both
being probably — indeed, almost certainly, — Jews,
will be of even greater interest. Though Jewish
names are not uncommon on tablets of this class,
it is to be noted that Jews settled at Babylon had
no objection to taking Babylonian names, such as
were given to Daniel and his companions. The
name of the scribe (though he is seemingly a Baby
lonian, and the name is a common one) is not without
interest, for Marduka is apparently for Mardukaa,
" the Merodachite '' (worshipper of Merodach), the
same as Mordecai, the name of a well-known Israelite
frequently mentioned in the book of Esther. It
must not be supposed, however, in the case of Mor
^ See the articles by Prof. E. and Dr. V. Revillout in the Babylonian and Oriental Record, vol. i. p, 102, ff. ; and vol. ii. p. 57, ff. 2 I have a faint recollection of having seen the form Assur-taribi, but I could not find this form again when I looked for it afterwards to quote the reference. ' Also Muru and Mermer.



lo8 RECORDS OF THE PAST
decai, that he was in any way favouring heathenism
in accepting such a name as this, for at that time,
the word Marduk (Merodach) often meant simply
" god." A tablet I have recently copied, in mention
ing the various gods, explains them all as Marduk
or Merodach ; thus Nergal is " Marduk of battle
(qablu), Zagaga is " Marduk of battle " (takhazi),
Bel is " Marduk of lordship and dominion (?)," Sin
is " Marduk the illuminator of the night," etc. etc.
and it is manifest that the word " god " may be
substituted for Marduk with a very acceptable im
provement in the sense. This use of Marduk in the
sense of ilu is probably late.
It has been thought best, in the translation, for
the sake of clearness, to place the reference to the
locality where the transaction was made at the end.
In the original (as will be seen from the transcrip
tion), it comes between the list of witnesses and the
name of the scribe.
All the above texts were excavated by Mr. Hormuzd Rassam, in 1881 and 1882 at Babylon
and Sippara, the latter supposed to be the Sepharvaim
of the Bible.



THE DEDICATION OF THREE BABYLONIANS TO THE SERVICE OF THE SUN-GOD AT SIPPARA
Translated by the Editor
The text of the following curious document has been
published by Dr. Strassmaier in his Inscliriften von
Cambyses Konig von Babylon, Part I, No. 273 (Leip
zig, 1 890). It has unfortunately been injured in
one or two places, though in each case the reading
can be restored with more or less probability. The
text describes the dedication of three young men by
their mother, Ummu-dhabat, to the service of the
Sun-god of Sippara, and thus offers an interesting
parallel to the history of the dedication of Samuel
by his mother Hannah (i Sam. i.) Samuel, however,
was " brought unto the house of the Lord in Shiloh "
as soon as he had been weaned, whereas the Baby
lonian mother waited until her sons were grown up
and had been " counted among the men," before she
presented them to Samas the Sun-god.
They then became attached to " the house of
the males " {bit zikari), of which we hear several
times in the tablets published by Dr. Strassmaier.



RECORDS OF THE PAST
Thus we are told that on the 6th day of the month
lyyar, in the 5 th year of Kambyses, a large quantity
of dates were conveyed from the sutummu or " store
house " of the king for the support of " the males "
and their superintendant Takh-Gula, on account of
their ministry in the temple during the preceding
month of Nisan ; while ten measures of dates were
delivered to a certain Arduya for their use in the
service of the goddess Anunit during the month of
lyyar.^ So, again, on the 21st day of the month
Ab in the same year, sixty measures of tribute
{makka'su, Heb. meke's, Numb. xxxi. 28) were regis
tered as having been provided for them and their
superintendent on account of the " daily sacrifice
during the month Elul.^ It would therefore seem
that a Babylonian temple had attached to it a sort
of college of priests, who lived together apart from
women, under a head or president, and who were
called upon to perform certain religious functions in
the services of the temple. It is possible that the
priests, who are specially distinguished by the title
of " males," were celibates. At all events they could
be dedicated to the service of the gods by their
mothers, just as Samuel was by Hannah.
The college or "house of the males" reminds us of
the Roman collegia, as well as of the cells inhabited
by the celibate monks who were attached to the
Serapeum at Alexandria. It also reminds us of the

account given in the book of Daniel of the education
of Daniel and his three companions, though in their
case it was a temporary isolation from female society
and not a perpetual dedication to divine worship,
and was, moreover, intended to fit them for the
service of the king and not of the gods.



THE DEDICATION OF THREE BABYLONIANS TO DIVINE SERVICE

Consequently a mere verbal declaration, as in the case of Hannah, was not sufficient ; it had to be accompanied by the prescribed legal document with the names of the witnesses attached to it. * " The servant of Kin." The triad or trinity of deities worshipped
at Sippara'consisted of Samas, A (who, in the Semitic period, was regarded as the wife of the Sun-god), and Kin (perhaps the son of Samas and A).

THE GREAT INSCRIPTION OF ARGISTIS ON THE ROCK OF VAN
Translated by the Editor
The following inscription is engraved in cuneiform
characters, but in the Vannic language, on the face
of the cliff on which stands the castle of Van in
Armenia. It records the conquests of Argistis, the
son and successor of Menuas, who widely extended
the empire of Bianias or Van in the early part of the
eighth century B.C., at a time when Assyria was in
a state of weakness. The Vannic armies marched
victoriously in all directions, and even threatened the
frontiers of Assyria. As will be seen from the
Assyrian Chronicle, of which a translation is given
in the Records of the Past, new series, ii. p. 123, the
reign of Shalmaneser III was mainly spent in war
with Ararat or Armenia. His successor, Assur-din,
seems to be referred to by Argistis in this inscription
(No. ii. 52).
The inscriptions of which the text is composed
are cut below the site of the citadel built by Sarduris I,
the founder of the Vannic monarchy (b.c. 840).
They begin to the right of a small chamber ex

cavated in the western face of the rock at the com
mencement of a flight of twenty steps. Above the
steps are the three first inscriptions (l, li, and iii),
which are divided from one another by vertical Hnes,
and should properly be regarded as the three columns
of one and the same inscription. Turning a corner
at the end of the steps we reach the entrance into a
series of five sepulchral chambers. To the left of
the entrance are inscriptions IV, V, and VII, while
above it is the mutilated inscription VI, and on the
right inscription Vili.
The inscriptions were first copied by Prof. F. E.
Schulz, and published in the Joicrnal Asiatique, 3d
series, ix. 52, in 1840. They were again copied by
Sir A. H. Layard in 1850, whose variant readings
were published by myself in 1882, and also by Dr.
L. de Robert in 1876. The copies of the latter,
however, are not trustworthy. Squeezes of the in
scriptions have further been taken by M. Deyrolles,
and are preserved in the Louvre, where they have
been examined by M. Stanislas Guyard.
The inscriptions were first deciphered by myself
in 1882, and translations published in my Memoir
on " The Cuneiform inscriptions of Van " in the
Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, xiv. 3, pp.
571-623. Corrections and improvements were
subsequently made in the translations by M. Stanislas
Guyard, Prof D. H. Miiller, and myself, and were
embodied in a paper I contributed to the Jownal of
the Royal Asiatic Society, xx. i, in 1888. The

following version brings them up to the present
level of our knowledge of the ancient language of
Van. For a description of the latter reference may
be made to the Records of the Past, new series, i.
p. 163.
The great inscription of Argistis is the prototype
of the similar historical inscription carved by Darius
Hystaspis on the rock of Behistun, and may have
suggested the latter to the Persian king. At all
events the bilingual inscription of Xerxes, which is
engraved on the south side of the cliff of Van,
expressly states that it was his father Darius who
had originally intended to have it made.
The inscriptions which follow are numbered
XXXVII, XXXVIII, XXXIX, XL, XLI, XLII, XLIII, and XLIV in my Memoir on the Vannic texts.

In the time of Menuas " the son of Diaus " was called Udhupursis {Sayce, xxx. 12), and it is probable that it was the same prince who opposed Argistis. ^ Tarius, which means "powerful," may not be a proper name. In this case we should translate : " the powerful country.

MONOLITH INSCRIPTION OF ARGISTIS, KING OF VAN
Translated by the Editor
The following inscription was discovered by Sir
A. H. Layard on a stone under the altar of the
church of Surk Sahak at Van, and though the
beginning and end of it are lost it supplements the
great historical inscription of Argistis on the rock of
Van, and is therefore given here. It was published
by myself for the first time in my Memoir on the
"Cuneiform Inscriptions of Van" in 'Coft Journal oj
tJie Royal Asiatic Society, xiv. 4. The translation of
it I offered there can now be improved in several
particulars. The inscription is numbered XLV in my
Memoir.

** He is stated by Menuas to be " a native of the city of Khaldiris," a word which signifies '
' the Khaldirian " in Vannic, and shows that the Vannic language was spoken in the place.

PREFACE
I HAVE again to deplore the death of one of my
colleagues, Mr. G. Bertin, whose contributions to
Assyriology had secured for him a foremost place
in the small band of Assyrian scholars. Like M.
Amiaud, he had especially devoted himself to the
study of Sumerian, in which, therefore, his loss will
be particularly felt. His valuable contribution to the
third volume of the present series of Records of the
Past on the precepts of early Sumerian agriculture
was one of the last literary works upon which he
was engaged.
The tablets discovered at Tel el-Amarna naturally
continue to absorb a large part of the attention both
of Assyriologists and of Egyptologists, so far, at
least, as they have been published, since the collec
tion contained in the British Museum is still, at the
moment of my writing this, inaccessible to scholars.
Repeated examination of the originals is clearing up
doubtful points in the text and correcting the read
ings of the first copyists. Thus, as will be seen from
the translations I give in this volume, the important
passage referring to the deity worshipped at Jeru



PREFACE
salem which occurs in one of the letters of Ebed-tob,
and which I have quoted in my preface to the last
volume of the series, must be amended in more than
one respect (see p. 72, line 16, and note 9). In
another tablet published in the Mittheilungen aus
den orientalischen Sammlungen, ii. No. 39, the Rev.
Dr. Scheil has pointed out that mention is twice
made of " the Yaudu." In the Assyrian inscriptions
of a later period the name of the Jews is written in
the same manner, and the question accordingly pre
sents itself whether the " Yaudu " of Tel el-Amarna
can be identified with the descendants of Judah.
The mutilated letter, however, in which the name is
found is shown, both by its phonology and by the
references it contains, to have been despatched from
Syria, or at all events from the northern part of
Palestine, where it is difficult to account for the
presence of Jews. So far as the shattered condition
of the tablet permits we may translate it as follows :
" Thou hast made me stand in front of the great
gate, and thou art my lord, and let my lord listen
to the servants of his servant. Send Aziru thy
servant into the places (for which) thou didst not
commission (?) him, and let him defend the provinces
of the king my lord. A second time (I say) to
Dftdu my lord : Hear the words of the kings of the
country of Nukhasse (which) they have spoken unto
me : Thy father with gold .... the king of Egypt,
and . . . the end of his levy from Egypt and all
the provinces and the soldiers of the Yaudu . . .



PREFACE Vll
[thus] they have spoken . . . [send therefore] Aziru
from Egypt, and now I will remove (?) the Yaudu
from the country of [Tu]nip." Tunip was the
modern Tennib, north-west of Aleppo, while Nukh
asse lay between Aleppo and Hamath. How any
body of soldiers with the name of Yaudu could be
found in this region is a puzzle.
Two inscriptions, however, discovered by German
explorers, may hereafter help to throw light on the
question. The more important of the two, now at
Berlin, was found near Sinjerli, a little to the north
east of the Gulf of Antioch. It is a monument
erected by Bar-tsor in honour of his father Panammu,
king of Samahla, who is mentioned among the tribu
taries of Tiglath-pileser III. The inscription, which
is in Aramaean letters, refers to " Tiglath-pileser king
of Assyria," the names both of Tiglath-pileser and
of Assyria being written as they are in the Old
Testament. The language of the inscription is to
a certain extent Aramaic, but to a much greater
extent Hebrew, and thus presents a philological
problem of the highest interest, for the solution of
which we must look to Prof Sachau and his col
leagues at Berlin. In any case it points to Hebrew
influence in the extreme north of Syria as far back
as the eighth century before our era. The past year has added to our knowledge of
Babylonian history and chronology. In the Academy
of Sth September 1891 Mr. Pinches gives an account
of the historical results of the American excavations



vm PREFACE
at Niffer, the ancient Nipur. Not only have con
temporaneous inscriptions of Sargon of Accad and
his son Naram-Sin (3800 B.C.) been found there, but
also texts of another king of the same age called
Erimus. It seems probable that the name of a fourth
king, Garde, belonging to the same period, has also
been discovered.
Objects inscribed with the names of certain kings
of the Kassite dynasty, one of which is new, have
also been disinterred. Two of the names are written
phonetically, and read Kadas-man-Turgu and Kadas
man-Urbe, which, as Mr. Pinches points out, must
signify " my trust is the god Turgu " and " my trust
is Bel." This settles the reading of the name which
I have given as Kara-Urus in the first volume of this
series (p. 1 6), and which must accordingly be corrected
into Kadas-man-Urbe, and it further shows that the
identification of the latter with Kudur-Bel, the father
of Sagasalti-Buryas, must be given up. Moreover,
Mr. Pinches is clearly right in regarding Gandis, the
founder of the Kassite dynasty, as identical with
Gaddas, a prince who styles himself " king of Sumer
and Accad," and " king of Babylon " {Babylonian and
Oriental Record, i. 4).
The important fragments of the Babylonian
Chronicle recently discovered by Mr. Pinches and
translated by him in this volume, throw fresh light
on the date to which the Kassite dynasty must be
referred. We now know that Rimmon-suma-natsir, or Rimmon-nadin-akhi (for the name may be read



PREFACE ix
either way), the 3 2d king of the Kassite dynasty,
drove the Assyrian conqueror, Tiglath-Uras, out of
Babylon, and that the seven years' reign of the latter
has been omitted by the patriotic compiler of the list
of Babylonian kings. Now Sennacherib tells us that when he conquered Babylon he recovered a seal of
Tiglath-Uras which had been there for 600 years. The seal seems to have been made to commemorate the conquest of Babylonia by the Assyrian monarch,
since the inscription upon it describes it as "the
property of the land of Kar-Dunis," or Chaldaea.^ Sennacherib sacked Babylon 691 B.C., and conse
quently the seal would have been engraved by order
of Tiglath-Uras in 1291 B.C. The Assyrian domina
tion would have lasted till 1284 B.C., which would
accordingly be the first year of Rimmon-suma-natsir,
and the Kassite dynasty would have come to an end
in 1222 B.C.
My conjecture, therefore, that the Babylonian
^ The account of the seal given by Sennacherib is as follows ( W. A. I.
,
iii. 4, No. 2) : " [The seal] of ' Tiglath-Uras, king of multitudes, the son of Shalmaneser, king of Assyria ; the property of the country of Kar-Du(nis). Whoever buries my writing (and) my name, may Assur (and) Rimmon destroy his name (and) his land. ' This seal accompanied the king from Assyria to Accad. I, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, after 600 years captured Babylon, and brought (it) out (and) carried (it) away from the treasure of Babylon. ' Whoever malces the seal legible (?) [ensures ?] the
preservation of my life.' — 'Tiglath-Uras, king of multitudes, the son of Shalman, king of Assyria ; the property of the country of Kar-Dunis.
Whoever buries [my writing and my name], may Assur and Rimmon [destroy] his name [and his land]. Whoever makes the seal legible (?)
[ensures?] the preservation of my life.' (This is) what (was) on the seal of crystal." Iktadin, "accompanied," iias the same root as kidinu, a synonym of talmutu, "companionship." I read doubtfully sa PUR-RA
PUR-RA GAR, " whoever makes (the seal) intelligible" or "legible." For the Sumerian puR-RA in the sense of "interpreting" see W. A. I., ii. 32, 67 ; iv. 16, 9.



PREFACE
princes who were contemporary with the Assyrian
kings, Tiglath-pileser I. and his son, belonged to the
dynasty of Isin, is disproved, and we shall have to
look for them among the kings of the Babylonian
dynasty which succeeded the " Elamite " of unknown
name {Records of the Past, New Series, i. p. 17).
According to Sennacherib, the defeat of Tiglath
pileser I. by the Babylonians took place 418 years
before his own conquest of Babylon, and consequently
1 109 B.C. On the other hand, the " Second Dynastic
Tablet " counts 120 years from the commencement
of the reign of Rimmon-suma-natsir to the death of
the " Elamite " usurper, which would bring us to
1 102 B.C. It is therefore evident that the compiler
of it has included the seven years' rule of the
Assyrians in Babylon in the reign of Rimmon-suma
natsir, and that therefore the Kassite dynasty must
have ended, not in 1222 B.C., but in 1229 B.C. The
round number of 600 years given by Sennacherib for
the length of time during which the seal of Tiglath
Uras remained in Babylon is seven years in excess,
the error having been occasioned by the omission of
the reign of Tiglath-Uras in the official lists of the Babylonian kings.
Between the date thus obtained and that given
by Alexander Polyhistor from Ber6ssos for the be
ginning of the Assyrian dynasty at Babylon there
is a difference of eleven years. We learn from the
extract preserved in the Armenian Chronicle of
Eusebios that after a short period of Assyrian



PREFACE
domination in Babylonia, symbolised by the name
of Semiramis, a dynasty of 45 kings governed the
country for 526 years, and was followed by Nabo
nassar in 747 B.C. The Assyrian domination conse
quently would have ended in 1273 B.C., so that
according to this calculation the conquest of Tiglath
Uras took place in 1280 B.C. It is plain that we
must read 536 for 526.^
The Kassite dynasty will have begun in 1806
B.C., that of Uru-azagga (or Tello) in 2174 B.C., and
that of Babylon in 2468 B.C. The reign of Kham
murabi will therefore have extended from 2356 B.C.
to 2301, and the raid of the Elamite Kudur-Nan
khundi with Babylonia in 2 2 8 5 B.C. will have happened
in the reign of his son and successor. But too much
confidence must not be placed in the earlier dates
given in the dynastic tablets. The reigns of the
kings are suspiciously long, and the same number
of regnal years recurs with almost impossible fre
quency. Moreover, it is not till we come to the
Kassite dynasty that any notice is taken of months
as well as of years. I am therefore inclined to believe
that the reign of Khammurabi must be placed about
^ The six "Arab" kings mentioned by George the Synkellos are evidently the first six kings of the dynasty of Isin, though the regnal years attached to their names are wide of the truth. The Third dynasty of Bgrdssos (as reported by Alexander Polyhistor) is the First dynasty of Babylon of the cuneiform tablets, the Fourth and Fifth dynasties representing the dynasties of Uru-azagga and the Kassites down to the conquest of Babylon by Tiglath-Uras. But the Greek writer has hot divided his dynasties in the same way as the compiler of the tablets, and it has long been recognised that the number of years they are severally said to have
ruled is impossible. The number of kings (58) belonging to the two
dynasties of the Greek writer corresponds with the number of kings in the three first dynasties of the cuneiform record.



PREFACE
seventy years later than the date assigned to it in
the dynastic tablets, and to abide by the conclusions
I arrived at in the first volume of this series, pp. lo,
1 1 . Further discoveries can alone settle the matter.
The length of time during which Babylonia was
governed by Kassite kings must have left a deep
impression upon the population. Accordingly, we
find that in the Tel el-Amarna tablets the Baby
lonians are called the Kassi, or people of Kas, a
name which appears in the Old Testament as Cush.
The Babylonian conquests in Palestine and the
profound influence they long exerted there, as re
vealed to us by the letters of Tel el-Amarna, at last
show light on the personality and origin of Nimrod.
The Hebrew or Canaanitish proverb which is quoted
in Genesis in reference to him shows that he must
have been a familiar figure in Canaanitish tradition,
and the fact that he was the son of Cush—which
has, of course, nothing to do with Cush or Ethiopia

indicates his Kassite origin.^ The seat of Kassite
supremacy was in Babylon and the adjoining cities ;
it never seems to have been very strong in Sumer
or Shinar ; and we can therefore understand how it
could be said of Nimrod that " the beginning of his
kingdom " was " Babel and Erech and Accad," Calneh
or Kulunu being the only town in Sumer over which
he claimed rule. Moreover, it was during the Kassite
period of Babylonian history that the kingdom of
' It may be noted that, according to George the Synkellos, the Chal
dasans made war against the Phoenicians in the year of the world 3945,
that is 1556 B.C.



PREFA CE
Assyria was founded, thus explaining the statement
of Genesis, that the kingdom of Nimrod, which began
in northern Babylonia, was continued in Assyria ; as
well as the passage in Micah (v. 6), where the paral
lelism proves that Assyria and " the land of Nimrod " are synonymous terms.
That Nimrod is to be identified with the hero of
the great Chaldaean Epic has been exploded by the
discovery made by Mr. Pinches of the true pro
nunciation of the latter's name. This was Gilgames,
a name which, as I pointed out in the Academy
(8th November 1 890), is found in ^Elian {Hist. Anim.
xii. 21) under the form of Gilgamos. Gilgamos was
the grandson of the Babylonian king Sakkhoras, or
Seuekhoros, who, in consequence of a prophecy that
he should die by the hand of his grandson, imprisoned
his daughter in a lofty tower. The daughter, how
ever, contrived to marry a man of plebeian rank, and
though the child which was born to them was thrown
from the tower, he was saved by an eagle which
caught him in mid-air, so that he survived to fulfil
the prophecy. In the Gilgamos of the Babylonian
legend we thus have the prototype of the Greek
Perseus, the double, in so many respects, of Herakles.
To pass from legendary to historical times. Dr.
Oppert has made a discovery which explains the
reason of the harsh measures adopted by Xerxes
towards the Babylonians, and his destruction of the
great temple of Bel. One of the contract-tablets
published by Dr. Strassmaier is dated in the first



XIV PREFACE
year of an otherwise unknown king of Babylon,
Samas - erba. The witnesses whose names are
attached to the contract show that it belongs to
the reign of Xerxes, and consequently that the
Babylonians must have taken the opportunity of
the disastrous expedition of Xerxes to Greece to
rise in revolt against their Persian masters and
establish once more a king of their own. The re
turn of Xerxes to the East brought with it the
punishment of the Babylonian rebels.

THE STELE OF KUBAN
Translated by Philippe Virey
This monument, discovered by Prisse d'Avennes in
the Nubian village of Kuban, opposite Dakkeh (the
ancient Pselchis), was removed by Count de Saint
Ferriol to the chateau of Uriage near Grenoble; a cast
of it exists in the Museum of the Louvre. It con
sists of a semicircle in which offerings are represented,
below which is a long text of 3 8 horizontal lines ; the
first half of the last 1 5 lines has been destroyed.
The text has been published by Prisse d'Avennes
(^Monuments ^gyptiens, pi. xxi.), and after him, but
only as far as line 25, by Chabas {Les Inscriptions
des mines d'or), and by Reinisch {Chrestomathie, pi.
X.) It has been translated or studied by Birch

The stele of Kuban states that the working of
the mines of El-Etbaye having been interrupted by
want of water, King Ramses II. remedied the evil
by excavating a well. The fact is not very im
portant in Itself, and it seems at first as If the
glorification of Ramses, which constitutes a principal
part of the text, might have been reserved for a
more worthy occasion. But we must not forget
that the king, as son of the Sun, was the Incarnation
of divinity In the world of mortals. The action of
the deity must be glorified in its humblest as well
as in its most exalted manifestations. By introduc
ing water into the desert, the union of which with
heat brings about the reproduction of living things,
Ramses carried life where it did not previously
exist, and thus acted like the Creator. This ex
planation justifies the pompousness of the language
about a matter so trivial, and at the same time
enables us to understand the character of the offer
ings represented in the semi -circular part of the monument.
This part, surmounted by the winged solar disk,
" the inhabitant of Hud, the great god who gives
life and prosperity," is divided into a northern and
southern side by a vertical line, where the following
words are found, starting immediately from the
winged disk, in order to communicate its gifts to
the reigning king : " Rd-usor-m^ Sotpenra. It is



THE STELE OF KUBAN
said : I grant thee the gift of all life, continuance
and prosperity ; of all health ; of all strength ; of
all power, of all power {sic), as the eternal Sun."
From the two sides of the cartouche of Ri-usor
m^ Sotpenra ^ rise two serpents crowned with the
white and red crowns, and representing the goddesses
of the south and north. They hold suspended the
symbol of life which they transmit from the disk
and royal cartouche to the figures of Ammon the
generator and Horus.
On the side of the goddess of the south, Ammon
the generator, crowned with the white crown, stands
on a support which represents the mA or symbol of
truth, reality, and realisation,^ and is in connection
with his neck, transmitting by its influence to him the
power of realising or producing. Above him are the
words : " Ammon the generator in the bosom of the
[arid] ^ mountain, beloved of Ammon the generator,
renovating [god], master of heaven." Behind him
is an altar in the form of a door out of which grow
flourishing persea-trees (?) We are reminded of what
happened after the death of the bull in the story of
the Two Brothers.* But here, in place of the two
fertilising drops of blood, we have two cups of wine
^ Placed immediately under the disk ; see 5 lines above, ^ Objects became real when touched by the fair visage of the goddess
Mi. See my Tombeau de Rekkmara, p. 149, note 2. ' Perhaps there is here an allusion to the fecundity which the introduction of the water must have brought to the desert.
* Papyrus d'Orbiney, pi. xvi. 11. 8-10; pi. xvii. i. "He (the bull) let fall two drops of blood . . . the one on one side of the great gate of Pharaoh, and the other on the other side, and they grew into two great persea-trees."



RECORDS OF THE PAST
offered by the king, which are to carry life to the
desert. " Presentation," says the text, " of two vases
of wine to father Ammon the generator in the
bosom of the [arid] mountain." Ramses II. stands
making the offering, crowned with the helmet out
of which the uraeus issues. Behind his helmet hang
two strings by which the winged disk with the end of its wing "communicates all life behind him (in
his neck) as the eternal Sun."
Above the king, who holds the two vases of
fertilising liquid, are the words : " [The work of]
life [is performed] by the beautiful god ^ Rd-usor-ma
Sotpenra, son of Ra, Ramses beloved of Ammon,
giving life (by means of the fertilising liquid)." Thus
on the side of the goddess with the white crown we
see the principle of humidity brought by precisely
that one of the agents of fertilisation which the king
is about to create in the desert by means of a well.
To continue the work of life heat is now required ;
this action will be represented to us on the side of
Horus and of the goddess with the red crown.
Ramses II. continues to stand, crowned as on the
other side. As on the other side also, the winged
disk with the end of its other wing " communicates
all life behind him as the eternal Sun." . The in
scription placed above the king tells us that here
we have " the beautiful god, R&-usor-mi Sotpenr^,
^ Ankh-mUer-nofer. The sign dnkh, which is not reproduced in all the publications of the text, is very visible on the cast in the Museum of the Louvre. I attribute to it a verbal sense (" performs life").



THE STELE OF KUBAN
Ramses beloved of Ammon, who vivifies like the
Sun" ^ that is to say, as I have just stated, by the
action of heat. Hence it is no longer the generous
liquid, the agent of fertilisation, but the flaming
incense which the king presents, with the legend :
" Burning incense ^ to father Horus, lord of Boki,' he
gives life." The offering is made to Horus, crowned
with the pshent, and holding in the right hand the
symbol of life which the goddess with the red crown
transfers to him, and in the left hand the sceptre of
prosperity. It is he, says the legend, " who gives
all life and prosperity, all enlargement of heart."
" I grant thee," he says to Ramses, " length of years
as king." While presenting the incense he " repeats
thrice * : Horus, lord of Bok[i] ! " And the god
answers him : " I give thee all foreign lands beneath
thy sandals." There is here a double meaning.
^ Ti Anhh RA ma, " giving life like the Sun.
"
2 " Making incense." To bum incense after a libation was to prepare
for the reproduction of that which has lived. See my Tombeau de Rekhmara, p. 84, note 4 ; p. 90, 1. 12 ; p. 92, note 6, etc. 2 Identified by Brugsch with Aboccis, must be placed, according to Chabas, between Primis and the Second Cataract. There is here a sort of play on words, Bok being the name of the hawk, the attribute of Horus. ^ The operations of incensing, in order to prepare for a reproduction or a birth, are constantly repeated three times. The flame is made to ascend thrice on the altar, in order to prepare for the resurrection of Rekhmara ( Tombeau de Rekhmara, p. 92), just as when Cyrene, desiring to revivify the bees of Aristasus, begins by invoking the humid principle : " Oceanumque patrem rerum, Nymphasque sorores,
"
and causes the fragrant flame to mount thrice on the burning altar :
" Ter liquido ardentem perfudit nectare Vestam " Ter fiamma ad summum tecti subjecta reluxit." Virgil, Georg. iv. 382, 384, 385.
This flame which rises and falls represents hfe which unceasingly mounts to heaven and redescends upon the earth. I have studied this question more in detail in Quelgues observations sur I'ipisode d'ArisUe, pp. 21-23.



RECORDS OF THE PAST
The word set or test, which signifies " foreign
countries," means also " the mountain '' or " desert,"
in opposition to to-r ter-f, " the entire plain " or
valley of the Nile, together with the Delta. The
desert mountain is the domain of Set, the god of
annihilation and sterility. The king representing
Horus or the good principle, takes possession of this
" foreign land " by introducing into it the water
which brings life, and Horus assures to him the
conquest of it.
We now reach the text in horizontal lines which
contains the historical portion of the inscription.

^ The inhabitant of Hud is the solar disk with its feathered wings. * The sun shines like silver-gilt and soars like a hawk above the mountains of the valley of the Nile. ' I suppose the shadow which reUeves us at certain hours after the solar heat is itself considered a benefit of the sun, the solar disk being held to produce it by covering with its wings (see note 5) the space it wishes to protect. 8 Literally " which is (« for enti) strong and powerful."

A STELE OF KING SMENDES
(Twenty-first Dynasty)
Translated by Professor Maspero
King Smendes, the founder of the twenty- first
Tanite Dynasty, has long eluded the researches of
the Egyptologists. It is only three years ago that
M. Daressy, assistant -conservator of the Museum
of Cairo, had the good fortune to discover a monu
ment belonging to him. He at once published the
text and a translation of it under the title of
" Les Carrieres de Gdb61din et le roi Smendes," in
the Recueil de Travaux relatifs a la Philologia et
a VArcheologie egyptiennes et assyriennes, x. pp.
133-138.
It was at Dababieh, opposite to Gebelein, some
miles above Thebes, and on the right bank of the
Nile, that he made the discovery. Quarries exist
there of considerable size and of very hard limestone,
which is as serviceable to the sculptor as to the
builder ; some of the quarries are open to the sky,
others consist of large chambers excavated in the
rock. In one place, on a column of the rock which
has been left at the entrance of the quarry, is a

quantities for " the temple of Millions of Years of
Menm^rJ (otherwise, of himself), which is on the west
of Thebes." This temple is that of Qurnah, and the
inscription thus allows us to determine the spot from
which a portion of the materials used in its con
struction had been brought. The quarry continued
to be worked in Graeco-Roman times, as is proved
by the graffiti copied in it by A. H. Sayce, and
published by him under the title of " Inscriptions
grecques d'ligypte," in the Revue des Etudes Grecgues,
iv. pp. 46-48.^
In the quarry situated about 30 yards to the
south of that in which the tablet of Seti is found,
the inscription of Smendes is engraved in beautifully
formed characters on a large stele. The stele
occupies the northern face of a column at the
entrance of the quarry. About a third of the text
at the commencement and about half of it towards
the end has been destroyed by searchers for treasure.
What remains is similar in appearance to the stele
of Shishak I. and Auputi at Gebel-Silsileh. Above
the stele the solar disk expands its wings, flanked
on the right by a vertical band which contains the

"nth year" of Alexander Severus (a.d. 332). The latter is dedicated
to " Pridtos, the greatest god, and Oregebthis and Isis Resakemis and the greatest gods with them."

words : " The good god, master of the two worlds,
master of all action, Uzkhopirri Sotpuniri, son of the
Sun, master of diadems, Nsbindidi Miamun." The
band on the left, which has disappeared, probably
contained the same legend.
Under the winged disk is a double scene of
adoration. On the right the king Nsbindidi Miamun
makes an offering to Amonra, " the god from whom
is derived the Ennead of the two Egypts, the god
who was at the moment of creation," as well as to
Khonsu the master of Truth. On the left the
offering was made to Amon the lord of Karnak, and
to a divinity now destroyed, who was probably
Mut.
The inscription comprises 17 lines written from
right to left. The two first contain the full protocol
of the king, which it is needless to translate here
;
the important part of the text begins in the third
line.

The phrase is literally " Being in the condition of a great torrent which cuts {aquhu] greatly behind it [m-\sa-'\f)." The word Sautu &it, with the determinative of "house," is a compound of sauia, "wall," and the adjective da. Hence the rendering "opisthodoma. '

His majesty then caused [workmen to be summoned] 10.

The lacunas at the end of each line have not
allowed me to translate all parts of this remarkable
document with an equal amount of certainty. I
have filled them up in the simplest manner I could,
and have tried rather to find a probable meaning
than to restore the context in its entirety ; but I
believe I have sufficiently grasped the sense of the
narrative to make it clear to the reader. King
Smendes was at Memphis when the events recorded
took place ; he occupied himself with matters which
concerned Thebes, and gave orders to open a quarry
at Gebelein. His power therefore extended over the
whole of Egypt, or at all events from the First
Cataract to the Mediterranean. There is nothing in
the inscription which permits us to determine
whether he was identical or not with the Hrihor Siamon of the Theban monuments ; for my own
part I am inclined to separate them, without, how

ever, having as yet any definitive evidence on the
subject.
The matter about which the inscription treats
relates to the restoration of the buildings of the
temple of Amon at Thebes. It seems that the
piece of water and the canal made by Thothmes III.,
to which there seems to be a reference in the
mutilated stele of that prince which is now in the
museum of Gizeh,^ were partly destroyed ; the
water had drained off from them and excavated a
channel in the soil which extended from the front to
the back of the principal edifice, thus endangering
the safety of the latter. The king declares that he
is constantly occupied in remedying all the disasters
which have happened in his time, and that he will
be able to remedy this fresh one. The measures
which he takes to ensure the rapid execution of the
work are very interesting ; unfortunately the lacunae
do not allow us to learn them all. I think I can see
that he employed compulsory labour by means of
relays of men changed each month, in which all the
population of the districts around Gebelein had to
take part. The passage in which it is said that
" even the infants on the breast of their mother ran
to cut [the stone]," is less hyperbolical than we
should be tempted to believe. Even to-day, when
a corvh has been ordered for the repair of a canal,
the women who are employed in carrying the earth
in baskets come with their children at the breast,

and since the suckling of infants is prolonged to a
late period in Egypt, infants (nekkinu) may be seen
playing and babbling in groups by the side of the
labourers.
The stele, intended to commemorate the opening
of the quarry, is silent on the works which were
undertaken at Thebes. But the restoration took
place and must have left traces behind it. It would
perhaps be useful to make excavations in the neigh
bourhood of the lake of Thothmes III. We should
have a chance of discovering there, it may be, an
inscription which will complete the text of Dababieh,
it may be a cartouche which will allow us to
determine indubitably what parts of the building
were attacked by the water and subsequently con
solidated by king Nsbindidi or Smendes.



THE LISTS OF THE PLACES IN NORTHERN SYRIA AND PALESTINE CONQUERED BY THOTHMES III.
By the Rev. H. G. Tomkins
The following are the lists of the places in Northern
Syria and Palestine conquered by Thothmes III. of
the Eighteenth Egyptian Dynasty, and engraved on
the walls of his temple at Karnak, as given in
Mariette's Karnak (plates 20, 21, 25, 26) and in
his Listes Geographiques, etc. (1875), ^"d described
in his Itineraire de la Haute Egypte. The identifica
tions proposed for the names contained in them
embody the results of many years' study and consul
tation with Prof Sayce, Prof Maspero, and other
scholars. Some of the identifications go back to
Mariette, others are due to Maspero, Brugsch,
Lenormant, Conder, and Noldeke. Since Mariette
and Brugsch first worked at them our knowledge of
the equivalences between the sounds of the ancient
Egyptian language and of the Semitic dialects has
become more exact. The first copies of the names,
moreover, have been corrected and recorrected. A
considerable proportion of the identifications proposed



26 RECORDS OF THE PAST
in the following pages may therefore be regarded as
definitively acquired by science.
The copies of the names originally made for
Mariette by Vassalli have been since revised by
Mr. Gol^nischeff in the Zeitschrift fur Aegyptische
Sprache, 1882, pp. 145 sq., and by Prof. Maspero in
the Recueil de Travaux relatifs a la Fhilologie et d.
VArch^ologie igyptiennes et assyriennes, vii. 2, 3, 1886,
pp. 94 et seq. Last winter the Palestine list was
further collated with the original by Mr. Wilbour and
Prof Sayce, who have found, among other things,
that the third name ought to be Kh{a)zai, and not
" Khaai," as was previously read.
In examining the North Syrian list I have derived
great assistance from Rey's Mimoire siir le Nord de
la Syrie (1873), and Carte de la Montague des
Ansari/s, Burton and Drake's Unexplored Syria
(1872), Neubauer's Ghgraphie du Talmud (1868),
Sachau's Reise in Syrien und Mesopotaniien (1883),
and the Carte du Liban of the French War Office
(1862). For the Palestine list reference should be
made to Prof Maspero's " Names of the List of
Thothmes IIL which may be assigned to Judaea," in
the Transactions of the Victoria Institute for 1888
(vol. xxii.), and his List of Galilee, Trans, of Victoria
Institute for 1886 (vol. xx.)
The names amount in all to 355, the last five of
which are destroyed. The first 119 are described
as belonging to "the Upper Rutennu," which, an
analysis of them shows, must denote Palestine. But



PLACES IN NORTHERN SYRIA AND PALESTINE 27
a careful study of them also shows that in order to
increase the number of the Pharaoh's conquests and
fill the surface of the wall, the same name or names
have been sometimes repeated, while at other times
such descriptive terms as " the country," " the
meadow," " the tilled land," or " the spring," have
been reckoned as separate geographical titles. The
lists seem to have been compiled from the memoranda
made by the scribes who accompanied the king on his
military expeditions ; this will account for the repeti
tion of the same name under slightly different forms.
The discovery of the Tel el-Amarna tablets has
informed us that in the age of the Eighteenth
Dynasty the Babylonian language and system of
writing were known and used throughout Western
Asia. This raises the presumption that some at
least of the names in the lists were originally written
in cuneiform, a presumption which is confirmed by
an analysis of No. 284 in the North Syrian list.^
There is no need of drawing attention to the light
shed by the names not only upon the early geo
graphy of Syria and Palestine, but also upon the his
tory and languages of the Hittites and the Canaanites.
The lists are engraved in more than one place.
They occupy the wall of the southern pylon built by
Thothmes III. at Karnak, and also the northern
wall at the western end of the temple.
In transliterating the names the vowels have been
1 [No. no in the Palestine list seems conclusively to point to the same fact.— Ed.]

represented only where they occur in the hieroglyphic
original, the outstretched arm being denoted by d.
Variant spellings are given in many cases, and it must be remembered that r and / in ancient Egyptian
are expressed by the same characters. The deter
minative of " country " is denoted by the double
obelus (I), and the single upright line which signifies
" one " in the hieroglyphics, as well as the sign of
the plural, is represented by a dash (—). Lost
characters are represented by brackets [ ].
Sachau's Reise are referred to as " Sachau,"
Porter's Syria and Palestine (1875) as "Porter," and
the geographical references in the Palestine list are
to the great map of the Palestine Exploration Fund.^
It will be understood that I give the suggested
identifications with different degrees of reserve.
Many are ascertained with certainty. It would be
impossible within our limits to define the shades of
probability in others. And of course I am only
giving my contribution as the result of many years
of study, but with no assumption of authority.
It is right to mention that I have from time to
time communicated the results of these studies to
the Society of Biblical Archaeology in 1883, 1885,
and 1887; and also at the Bath meeting of the
British Association in two papers, since published in
the Babylonian and Oi'iental Record, vol. iii.

Tul-bnta, or DuR-BNTA. Prof Maspero proposes to identify this with Der el-Benat, the Castrum Puellarum of Eastern Latin Chronicles, a fortified village nearly midway between Aleppo and Antioch. The real derivation is doubtless from Burnt, the creating goddess. Compare Dur-ummu-banit, built in Babylonia by Khammurabi. This is a very good identification. Clearly the Dh-r-b-n-th of Geog. du Talmud, 418. 218. Mauti. Lenormant proposed Mut-Kinu of Shalmaneser II. But I think it may be a shortened form of the Yari-muta of the Tel el-Amarna tablets, which I believe to be Armuthia, south of Killis. Compare No. 318. 219. Naapi.
220. Akhmrur —, or Akhmaaul. This maybe Akhmul,
modern Akhmil, east of Tennib (Tunipa, No. 127).
221. Atur —. "The country of Ya'turu " (writes Lenor
mant), "one of the districts of Patin." This would agree with the region in question. 222. Kartamrut. The former element I have always taken as equivalent to Qiriath. Prof. Maspero agrees in this view, and divides the name accord

Here we seem to have both parts separate. 223. AsiTA, or "district of Sita." Compare Nos. 202, 216. 224. Tanirs. 225. EiANU. " lanu the great" was one of the important triad of fortresses taken by Thothmes III., the others being Anaugas (see No. 148) and Harankal. These were all, as I believe, commanding positions on the Euphrates. This place I take to be the modern Einyah, west of the river, south of ed-Der
(see No. 154). The name is also written with the determinative of " water." 226. At-bana or At-banti. This seems to involve the name of Atha the goddess. It seems to be the ancient Dabana on the Belikh, modern Dahabanieh. See No. 191. If the reading At-banti is right, we seem to have the name of the goddess conjoined with the title of ban({)ti, " creatress." 227. AsHAMB. " Asimu of the cuneiform documents," says Lenormant, "on the west bank of the Euphrates." This is evidently the Yasimah on Euphrates which Dr. Neubauer proposes to identify with Yasinia of the Talmud {Giog. du Talmud, 293). Comp. No. 195. 228. Atakar.

= lake] on the way from Antioch to Aleppo ; or is
it possibly Imma, Tmm ? 311. Khal-bu J. Aleppo (Haleb), still the head-quarters of a very extensive province, as in the days of Thothmes III. It had a Sutekh (god Set) of its own in the treaty of Rameses II. The Assyrian form of the name is Khalvan. 312. Pi-aun-r. It should be read Pi-aur, and I think the name is identical with Pieria, the mountain district north-west of Antioch. 313. 'Aaurma. The plain of Antioch (see No. 308) is
called " sometimes the Umq of Uerem " (Ainsworth, Researches in Assyria, etc., p. 299). But perhaps the name is Arima, a name given by the Greek geographers to the Cilician Taurus (see Perrot, Rev. des Deux Monies, 1886, p. 330). Comp. No. 208. 314. Samalua.

Saresu was an important place in the treaty with Rameses II., with a Sutekh of its own. It must be the present Sarisat or Sresat, with ruins, west of the Euphrates and opposite to el-Burat.

[Mr. Wilbour and myself found that this is the reading of the name, previously miscopied Khaai : see Acade?ny, Feb. 28, 1891.

CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN PALESTINE AND EGYPT IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY B.C.
Translated by the Editor
The authorities of the Royal Museum of Berlin have
laid scholars under an obligation by their speedy
publication of all the cuneiform tablets found in the
ruins of Tel el-Amarna which are now at Berlin.
Their action contrasts favourably with that of our
own British Museum, which has for three years with
held the tablets in its possession even from the sight
of students. The three parts of the Mittheilungen
aus der orientalischen Sammlungen, in which the
tablets are published, together form a work worthy
of the Museum that has issued it. Drs. Winckler
and Abel, to whom the copying and editing of the
texts have been entrusted, have performed their task
with marvellous accuracy and skill, which can be
fully appreciated only by those who have themselves
attempted to copy the extremely difficult inscriptions
of Tel el-Amarna. The new and complicated forms
of the characters and the injuries undergone by
many of the tablets make the work of a copyist



CORRESPONDENCE OF PALESTINE AND EGYPT 55
peculiarly hard. To the texts now at Berlin Dr.
Winckler has added those copied by him in the
Cairo Museum, as well as a few others belonging to
M. Gol^nischeff, Prof. Maspero, and the Rev. Ch.
Murch. When those belonging to the British
Museum are also given to the public, all that remains
of the Tel el-Amarna collection will be in the hands
of philologists and historians ; until they are pub
lished our knowledge of the collection will not only
be incomplete, but doubtless at times misleading.
The translations which follow are those of letters
from Palestine, more especially Southern Palestine,
which are all contained in the third part of the
Mittheilungen aus der orientalischen Sammlungen
(Berlin, Spemann, 1890). They must be received
with the indulgence due to the first translations of
ancient texts. The language of the letters is full of
forms and expressions which are new to the Assyri
ologist ; the large number of tablets, however, which
we can compare with one another, has thrown light
upon many of these, and explained words and idioms
which would otherwise have been obscure. Some
of the texts have been translated by M. Delattre in
the Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archceology,
Dec. 1890, March and April 1891.
Most of the letters which I have translated, if
not all of them, seem to have been written towards
the close of the reign of Amenophis IV., " the Heretic
King," when the Egyptian empire which had been
built up by the great monarchs of the Eighteenth



S6 RECORDS OF THE PAST
Dynasty was beginning to fall to pieces. One group
of them, of which the letter of the Governor of
Bashan (No. xxiii) is an example, relates to a general
levy of the governors and vassal princes of Palestine
and Syria. Some common danger threatened the
empire, and the subject states of Asia were called
upon to hold themselves ready to join the household
troops of Egypt with their own forces. Other letters
show that all parts of Palestine were in that disturbed
condition which usually precedes the fall of the
central authority. Enemies were attacking it from
without, and the petty princes were fighting among
themselves within. The tributary priest -king of
Jerusalem charges Malchiel and Su-yardata with
robbing him of a portion of his territory ; Su-yardata
retaliates by bringing a counter-accusation against
him. Complaints are lodged against a certain
Lab'ai, the seat of whose government was in Mount
Ephraim, from whence he intrigued against Megiddo
in the north and Gezer and Jerusalem in the south
;
and Lab'ai sends an abject letter to the Egyptian
king in order to prove his innocence.
The correspondence shows that Canaan was in
much the same political condition as India is at
present under British rule. Many of the cities were
under Egyptian governors, but in other cases the
native prince had been allowed to retain his title
and a certain amount of power. He was, however,
required to pay tribute, to admit an Egyptian garri
son within the walls of his city, and to receive from



CORRESPONDENCE OF PALESTINE AND EGYPT 57
time to time the visits of a specially appointed
Commissioner, who bore the title of " Gate-keeper,"
and corresponded to the " Resident " of a protected
state in India. At times a governor existed by the
side of the native king, whose power, therefore, must
have been merely nominal. Such was the case, for
example, at Sidon (Nos. xvi, xvii). Even where it
was not the case, the territory of the capital city was
called " the country of the King " of Egypt, and
Egyptian khazanute, or " governors," were imposed
upon the towns within it. The authority of the
native king, moreover, depended on the pleasure of
the Egyptian sovereign. Ebed-tob of Jerusalem
boasts that, unlike other princes in the province, he
alone derived his royal office from the oracle of a
god.
The letter of the Governor of Ziri-Basani (" the
plateau of Bashan ") proves that Mr. Tomkins was
right in holding that the list of the conquered towns of Canaan given by Thothmes III. at Karnak in
cluded the eastern side of the Jordan. The mention
of the city of Zaphon (see No. xiii, note on line 4)
points in the same direction.
The Egyptian troops in Palestine consisted of
the tsabi matsarti, or " soldiers of the garrison," who
were stationed in the subject cities, and of the tsabi
bitate, " the soldiers of the palace," or household
troops, who answered to our Guards, and were
attached to the person of the Egyptian governor.
Besides these there were the tsabi saruti, " the soldiers



S8 HECORDS OF THE PAST
of the kingdom," who seem to have been foreign
auxiliaries ; and at times also the amili khabbati,
" the plunderers," or Beduin, who were in the pay
of the Egyptian government. The vassal princes
were required to furnish soldiers, horses, and chariots
when ordered to do so ; in times of necessity, how
ever, it was to Egypt that the representatives of the
" Great King " appealed for military help.
In the period to which the correspondence belongs
Syria and the north of Palestine, at all events in the
neighbourhood of Sidon and Tyre, were threatened
by the Hittites ; while Central Palestine, from Hazor
to Gezer, was exposed to the attacks of the Khabbati,
or " plunderers." These can hardly be any other
than the Beduin, who still infest the plain of Sharon,
and were called Shasu, or " plunderers," by the
Egyptians. Southern Palestine, the eastern portion
of which constituted the territory of Uru'salim or
Jerusalem, was in danger from the Khabiri, whose
name occurs frequently in the letters of Ebed-tob.
From one of these (No. i, line 36) it would appear
that their leader was Elimelech. Jerusalem and the
district which depended on it were so seriously
menaced by them as to make Ebed-tob declare again
and again that if assistance were not at once sent to
him the province would be lost to Egypt. There is
no record that an answer was returned to these
urgent requests, and it therefore seems probable that
the letters of Ebed-tob were among the last which
Amenophis IV. received. If so, and if the Egyptian



CORRESPONDENCE OF PALESTINE AND EGYPT 59
king died shortly afterwards, we may feel certain
that no succours were despatched to the hard-pressed
province. The death of Amenophis IV. was the
signal for the outbreak of civil and religious war and
the withdrawal of the Egyptian garrisons from Asia.
The Khabiri would have been permitted to continue
their victorious career, and, it may be, to capture the
strong fortress of Jerusalem itself
The name of the Khabiri has been identified with
that of the Hebrews ; but the political circumstances
presupposed by the letters of Ebed-tob do not agree
with those which accompanied the entrance of the
Israelites into Canaan. Moreover, the word Khabiri
is Assyrian, and signifies " confederates," from the
same root as that which has given Heber, "the con
federate," and Hebron, " the confederacy," in Hebrew.
It corresponds to the name of the Kabyles in
Algeria, Kabyle being the Arabic Jabail, or " con
federates." Now it is a curious fact that Ebed
tob nowhere makes any allusion to the famous
sanctuary of Hebron, although his letters show that
his territory extended westward to Rabbah and
Keilah, and southward to Carmel, and that conse
quently Hebron ought to have been included within
it. The most probable explanation of the fact is
that the sanctuary was in the hands of others. We
know from the Old Testament that the original
name of the city in which the sanctuary stood was Kirjath-Arba, while the name of Hebron, "the
confederacy," must have been given to it in con



6o RECORDS OF THE PAST
sequence of its having been a meeting -place of
certain confederated tribes. Who these tribes were
we learn from the Biblical records. They were
Hittites and Amorites, with a sprinkling of the older
Canaanitish population of the land.
In these confederated tribes, therefore, the later
representatives of the confederacy of which we read
in Gen. xiv. 13, I see the Khabiri of the Tel el
Amarna tablets. Their centre was the great sanctu
ary of Kirjath-Arba, and it was from behind its
fortified walls that they sallied forth to attack the
officers of the Egyptian king. Ebed-tob's despairing
cries for help show us how formidable they had
become. That my view of their character is correct,
and that the withdrawal of the Egyptian troops from
Palestine enabled them to conquer both Jerusalem
and its territory, is indicated by a passage in the
book of Ezekiel (xvi. 2, 45). Here we read of
Jerusalem that her " father was an Amorite and
"
her " mother an Hittite." The letters of Ebed-tob,
whose name is Canaanite, and who uses Canaanite
words, like anuki, " I," lead us to infer that it was
not until after his time that the Amorite and Hittite
possessed themselves of the place. When the
Israelites entered Canaan a century after the age
of Ebed-tob they found Jerusalem a stronghold of
the Jebusite tribe of Amorites. It had ceased for a
while to be Jerusalem, and had become Jebus, the
" Jebusite " city.
The despatches of Ebed-tob tell us for the first



CORRESPONDENCE OF PALESTINE AND EGYPT 6i
time how ancient the name of Jerusalem was, and
also what was its meaning. It was the seat of the
worship and oracle of the god 'Salim, whose temple
stood on " the mountain " of Moriah. An Assyrian
tablet {W. A. /., ii. 2, 393 ; iii. 70, 100) informs us
that the word uru was the equivalent of the Assyrian
alu, " city," and since the name of Jerusalem is written
Uru-'salim in cuneiform, it is evident that it must
signify " the city of the god 'Salim." 'Salim is the
Hebrew sh&lom, and denoted the " god of Peace."
The deity, therefore, under whose protection Jeru
salem grew up was one in whose temple feuds and
rivalries were laid aside, and the neighbouring peoples
met in unity and peace. As Ebed-tob informs us,
the king of Jerusalem was appointed by an oracle
of the god, and was thus a priest rather than a
king. In Assyria the priests of the god Assur
preceded the kings of the city of Assur ; and Dr.
Glaser has lately shown that the same was also the
case in Southern Arabia, in the kingdom of Saba.
But whereas in Assyria and Saba the priests eventu
ally became kings, this did not happen in Jerusalem,
where the ruler remained royal priest or priest-king,
down to the time, at any rate, of Ebed-tob. He
was priest of 'Salim rather than king of Uru-'Salim.
An unexpected light is thus thrown on the person
and position of Melchizedek. Melchizedek is called
king of Salem instead of Jerusalem ; the reason is
now obvious. He was priest of El Elyon, " the
Most High God," and king only in virtue of his



62 RECORDS OF THE PAST
priestly office. It is also now clear why the father
of Melchizcdek is not named. Ebed-tob states that
his authority was not based on the right of inherit
ance ; he had been called to exercise it by a divine
voice. The state over which he presided was in
reality a theocracy. The letters of Ebcd-tob further show why it was
that Melchizedek went forth to bless Abram in the
name of his god after the defeat of the Babylonian
army. His god was 'Salim, the god of Peace
;
Abram's victory had delivered Palestine from the
invader and restored it again to peace. On the
other hand, the sacred character of the priest-king of
Jerusalem must have been acknowledged throughout
the neighbouring district, and to him accordingly the
victorious Hebrew paid the customary tithes.
The oracle of the god 'Salim quoted by Ebed-tob
is interesting upon two accounts. On the one hand
it shows that the Jewish prophets were not the first
to extend the range of their prophetic vision to
foreign nations. In so far as the people of Babylonia and Aram-Naharaim had an influence upon Canaan
itish politics, their future fortunes were a matter of
concern to the Canaanitish deity. On the other
hand, the oracle proves that Babylonian conquest
had made itself felt as far as Southern Palestine.
Incidentally, therefore, the historical character of
Chedorlaomer's campaign is thus indicated, as wel
as the tradition recorded by the Egyptian historian
Manetho, that the Hyksos, after their expulsion from



Egjpt. fortified Jerusalem against tlie Assyrians, as the Babylonians were called by the Greeks. The
fact that tlie oracle also mentions Nahrima or Aram
Naharaim supports the account of tlie oppression of
Israel by the king of tliat countr}.- shorth- after tlie
Israelitish occupation of Canaan. It shows tliat the
conquests of Xaharaim had already threatened tliat
part of Palestine in which Judali afterwards estab
lished itself
The name of Melchizedek is curiously illustrated
by a passage in one of the tablets (^Xo. vi, line 3J\
Ebed-tob here employs the Canaanite word tsadiig,
"just," whicli does not occur in Ass\-rian, the latter
language having substituted the root csiru for tsiuiiiq.
Since S}d\k was a Phoenician di\4nit\-, it is possible
tliat tlie god of Jerusalem was worshipped under tlie
title of Tsedeq, or " Righteousness " ; so that the
names of the two kings of Jerusalem mentioned in
tlie Old Testament would have meant "Tsedeq is
king," " Tsedeq is lord."
However this maj- be, tlie light thrown by tlie
letters of Ebed-tob on Melchizedek's title of " king
of Salem " casts furtlier light on the title applied b\
Isaiah (_ix. 6) to the coming Saviour, tlie " Prince of
Peace." Isaiah was a student of tlie histor>- of his
cit}- and country, and elsewhere he shows himself
acquainted with its past records, Sar s/ut/^m, " the
Prince of Peace." is, word for word, the Ass\-rian
sar Sii.'im, or " King of Salem." The correspond
ence cannot be an accidental one ; the Sa\-iour who



64 RECORDS OF THE PAST
should restore Judah would not only bring peace
with him, but would also be, in a higher and more
spiritual sense, the successor of Melchizedek. It
may be that the title of " the Mighty God " is a
reference to the old title of the god of Jerusalem as
" the mighty king."
The Egyptian monarch is frequently addressed as
" my gods " in the plural. He not only represented
the divine hierarchy, but he was also in a measure
its incarnation. But the title is not, like that of
" Sun-god," of Egyptian origin. It must therefore
be Canaanite, and is of interest as pointing to the
Canaanite origin of the use in Hebrew of the plural
Elohim, "gods," in a singular sense. The language
of the Israelites had thus prepared them for applying
to their God a plural noun. He was " God of gods,"
and in Him all their attributes and essences were
comprehended.
The letters from Palestine establish the fact that
reading and writing were widely known and practised
in the country at the close of the fifteenth century
before our era. But the writing was that of Baby
lonia, thus proving the deep impression which had
been made by Babylonian culture upon Western
Asia. It is difficult to account for the impression
except upon the hypothesis of Babylonian conquest.
The hypothesis is confirmed by the number of places
in Palestine which took their names from Babylonian
deities. Rimmon, the Babylonian Ramman, Anah
and Anath, the Babylonian Anu and Anat, Nebo,



CORRESPONDENCE OF PALESTINE AND EGYPT 6$
and even Sin—are all found in Palestine or the
countries immediately adjoining. How easy was
their introduction is shown by the letter of Ebed-tob,
in which he identifies the god of Jerusalem with the
Babylonian Uras. Uras was the form of the Sun
god who was specially worshipped at Nipur, and his
identification with 'Salim proves that the latter also
was regarded as possessing a solar character.

TEXT OF AMMISATANA, KING OF BABYLON
FROM ABOUT 2115 TO 2090 B.C.
Translated by Theo. G. Pinches
This text is written on a small broken tablet of
unbaked clay, in archaic characters. Unfortunately,
however, the end of the obverse and the beginning
of the reverse are wanting, and many of the lines
are exceedingly imperfect. The text is nevertheless
of the first importance, not only on account of the
historical information it gives, but also for the
Akkadian language. As it is recorded in the
colophon that it is " from Bel-usallim," written in
late Babylonian, it is clear that it is a copy made
about 550 B.C., probably from a stone slab. The
number is 80-1 i-i 2, 185.

104 RECORDS OF THE PAST
The importance of this text lies in the statement
that this king Ammi-satana, descendant of Sumula
ilu or Sumulan (2317-2282 B.C.), the second of
the Dynasty of Babylon,^ son of Abesu' ^ (2140
2 I I 5 B.C.) the eighth of the same dynasty, was not
only king of Babylon, Kes (Hymer), Sumer, and
Akkad, but of Phcenicia (Martu) as well. This is
probably the first indication that the sway of the
Babylonian kings of that early period extended so
far, and would explain (as Prof Sayce has pointed
out to me) how it was that Babylonian became the
language of diplomacy throughout Western Asia.
In this text Ammi-satana traces his descent from
Sumula-ilu or Sumulan, the second king of the
dynasty, without mentioning any of the intermediate
rulers (six in number), of whom Khammu-rabi, a
most renowned king, was one. The reason why he
does not mention the first of the dynasty, Sumu-abi,
as his ancestor, probably lies in the fact that (as
indicated by the Babylonian canon) he was not
descended from him,^ though belonging to the same
family.
It is worthy of note that the names of the kings
(eleven in number) of this dynasty are Semitic, all
but two or three being of foreign form, though some
seem to be expressed in the Akkadian style. The
1 See vol. i. p. 13. ^ Called Ebisum in the canon (vol. i. p. 13).
' The words "son of the same" {i.e. of Sumu-abi, the first king of the
dynasty) are not placed against the name Sumula-Ilu or Sumulan. See P. S. B. A. for Dec. 1880, p. 21, and Schrader, Die Keilinschriftlicke Babylcnische Konigsliste, col. i. 1. 2 of the Anlage.



TEXT OF AMMISATANA 105
dynasty to which Ammi-satana belonged is called by
the Babylonians " the dynasty of Babylon," but,
notwithstanding this, they may easily have been of
foreign origin—perhaps Arabian.
In line 8 there was in Bel-usallim's original a
mutilated part at the beginning of the line. This
he has indicated in the usual way, by inserting khibi
essu or khibessu, " a recent break," or " defaced."
The following word, however, is clear,—it is sa-pal
\pal\ generally transcribed lib-pal-pal. This group
is equivalent to binbinu, " grandson," " descendant,"
and seems to be a genuine Akkadian word. If this
be so, the forms of the Assyrian names Assur-natsir
pal, Assur-bani-pal, etc., are even more incorrect than
was formerly supposed, for it takes away the justifi
cation for reading the Assyrian for " son " as pal.
The correct forms are Assur-natsir-apli, Assur-bani
apli, etc., for that aplu {apli, apld) could ever become
pal in the mouth of an Assyrian is an impossibility.



AN EARLY TABLET OF THE BABYLONIAN CHRONICLE
Translated by Theo. G. Pinches
The text, of which a translation is here for the first
time given, is inscribed on a large tablet of unbaked
clay, originally about eight inches square. The
upper part, however, has now, to the extent of nearly
two -thirds, completely disappeared, as well as a
portion of the right-hand columns, many of the lines
being incomplete in consequence. On the whole,
probably less than one-third of the text remains.
The writing is, in general, clear, though it is not in
the best style. Portions of the surface preserved
have also suffered severely in the course of the
twenty - three centuries or thereabouts that have
passed since the inscription was written.
Judging from the wording and arrangement of
the text, it would seem that a copy of the series fell,
about 630 B.C. or earlier, into the hands of the
Assyrians, who probably compiled from it the series known as " The Synchronous History of Assyria
and Babylonia," leaving out, however, every reference
which might be considered damaging to the reputa

and who did not find " a lord " from " the rising to
the setting sun," hence the omission of these lines in
the " Synchronous History." We see from this part of
the text that the military system of the Babylonians

The long account of what seems to have occurred
in the land of Tamtim (?) (the coast of the Persian
Gulf, if this be correctly read) is omitted in the
" Synchronous History," and it is a great pity that
the text is so mutilated here, for the Babylonian
narrative was not a mere outline of what took place,
but a circumstantial history, probably quoted from
the account of some trustworthy eye-witness, and
seemingly not without literary merit. A letter of
Durri-galzu, of the nature of a royal proclamation,
referring to his successes, is there quoted. That this
also refers to the events in Babylonia may be
gathered from the fact that Durri-galzu says he
added Babylon and Borsippa to his country (B&bili
u Barsip Hi tseri-ia lii-usadhdhir^), these cities not
having, seemingly, accepted his rule on account of
his having been set on the throne by Assyria (see
vol. iv. p. 28). The account of Khurba - tila's
challenge to Durri-galzu, and of its disastrous results
to the former, are also omitted in the " Synchronous
History."
1 As satdru means " to write," and is only used in the Kal with this meaning, I tal<e this phrase to mean that Durri-galzu caused Babylon and Borsippa to be written down as part of his dominions.

This portion, so little creditable to Assyria, is
entirely omitted in the " Synchronous History " (see

narrative, and one cannot help wondering how it
is that the Assyrian who " edited " the record in his
own country has not at least mentioned Tukulti
Ninip's seven years' rule in Babylon. Was it that
this paragraph got destroyed ? or that Tukulti-Ninip
had such a bad name among his own countrymen
that they would not mention his glories ? Evidently
he was not a model ruler, and " the policy of his

that could have been wished, hence the revolt in
Akkad and Kar - Dunias (Babylonia). Whatever
may have; been his faults, however, they cannot
justify Assur-natsir-apli, his son, for the part that he
took against him—indeed, as the chief personage in
the kingdom after the king, he was probably leader
of the revolt, and would be therefore directly
responsible for his father's murder ; and it is not
surprising that this ruler, who must, during his reign,
have been renowned for his cruelties, began his
public career as a parricide. From line 1 2 onwards
the sense is doubtful in consequence of the mutila
tion of the record, but it would seem that the person
referred to as dwelling in Assyria and going to
Babylon was Tukulti-Ninip. In line 14 the upright
wedge meaning " to " is probably a mistake of the
scribe, unless we are to read Kidin-Khutrudis, in
which case lines 14-17 might be rendered as follows
:
"[In the . . . year?] of Bel-nadin-sum, the king,

Rammanu-sarra-iddina returned, and Kidin-Khut

etc. These paragraphs, likewise, do not occur in the
" Synchronous History," so that we have no help as
to the translation. If, as is to be hoped, a duplicate
of this important text comes to light, doubtless all

THE NIMRUD INSCRIPTION OF TIGLATH-PILESER III
Translated by S. Arthur Strong
The following inscription contains the annals of the
king, who—since the discovery ^ of a second Tiglath
pileser among the predecessors of Assurnatsirpal

is known as Tiglathpileser III. His real name
appears to have been Pul, or Pulu ; and that he was
the rightful heir to the throne, or even of royal
blood, is by no means certain. He never calls him
self the son of Assurnir^ri, the king his predecessor,
or indeed makes any allusion to his father
a
reticence unusual in an Assyrian king, and in
later times his monuments were to a large extent
defaced by Esarhaddon. But these facts do not
necessarily imply more than that he was only a
younger son of the royal house. On ascending the
throne (745 B.c) he took the name of the great
conqueror of the first Assyrian epoch, whose exploits
he was destined to rival, and this circumstance has
led the Biblical compiler into the mistake of sup
posing that there were two kings, Pul and Tiglath
1 Pinches, Guide to the Nimroud Central Saloon, p. g.



1 16 RECORDS OF THE PAST
pileser. Nevertheless the fact of their identity is
now completely established.
The operations of his first campaign (in 745)
were directed against the (partly nomadic) Aramaeans
and Chaldasans of the province of Babylon, who were
constantly threatening the stability of the Assyrian
power on the southern borders of the empire. Baby
lon itself he appears to have left undisturbed ; but
Sippara and Nififer, besides other towns of less im
portance, were taken. The power of the Aramseans
was broken, and their territory placed under the
control of an Assyrian governor, while the priests
of Babylon, Borsippa and Kutha, sent presents to
the conqueror in token of submission. In the
following year he moved eastward across the river
Zab, invaded the little - known territory of the
" mighty Medes," and pushed his conquests as far
as Bikni, " the mount of the rising sun."
His attention was now directed to the course of
events in the west. At Arpad, in Syria, whither he
had moved, he found himself confronted by a power
ful coalition, at the head of which was Sarduris, king
of Urardhi, or Ararat. Tiglathpileser lost no time
in attacking the allies, upon whom he inflicted a
signal defeat at Kummukhi (Komagene) ; but mean
while, during his absence from Arpad, this town had
become the centre of a hostile league, which included
the king of Hamath and, as it appears, Azariah, king
of Judah. Accordingly Tiglathpileser advanced upon
Arpad, which after a siege of three years was taken



NIMRUD INSCRIPTION OF TIGLATH-PILESER III 117
(in 740). Hamath soon shared the same fate.
These successes produced an immediate effect
throughout the whole district. Eighteen kings
sent tribute to Tiglathpileser, among them Rezin
of Damascus, Hiram of Tyre, and Menahem of
Samaria.
During the next three years (737-735) the east
and north-east again became the theatre of the
conqueror's exploits. After an unsuccessful attempt
to reduce the stronghold of Sarduris on lake Van,
he directed his march along the southern shore of
the Caspian sea, and penetrated into the recesses
of Media. At this point, owing to the obscurity
of the geographical names in the inscriptions, it
becomes impossible to determine with accuracy the
extent and direction of the king's further advance.
But one thing appears to be certain, and that is
that the Assyrian arms were carried eastward by
Tiglathpileser far beyond the limits reached by any
of his predecessors. Some scholars have even sup
posed that he made his way into the valley of the
Indus, and that to Tiglathpileser belongs the glory
of the conquests associated long afterwards in popular
tradition with the great name of Semiramis.
Leaving these remote fields of conquest and
adventure, the king again turned westward. Ahaz,
king of Judah, menaced by Rezin of Damascus and
Pekah of Israel, had appealed to Assyria for help.
Tiglathpileser advanced first against Rezin. A
battle was fought, and the king of Damascus was



Ii8 RECORDS OF THE PAST
driven to take refuge in his capital, where Tiglath
pileser blockaded him, as he tells us, " like a bird
in a cage." He then turned his arms against Israel ;
but here he seems to have left the capital unmolested,
and to have contented himself with overrunning and
devastating the surrounding country, parts of which
were annexed to Assyria. Gaza and Ashkelon,
strongholds of the Philistines, were next attacked
and taken, and the power of the conqueror made
itself felt even among the Arabian tribes on the
borders of Egypt, some of whom voluntarily sub
mitted, and retained their independence, while others
were incorporated with the empire. Meanwhile Pekah of Israel had been murdered ;
but the dififiiculty of the situation was peacefully
solved by Tiglathpileser, who either promoted the
murderer Hosea to the vacant throne, or, at any
rate, confirmed him in the possession of it. Whether
the expedition against Tabal and Tyre was under
taken at this time (732) or somewhat later is un
certain. Conducted, however, not by the king in
person, but by his general, it was completely success
ful, and from Tyre in particular the enormous sum
of 1 5 o talents was taken as tribute.
The king, having now finally established his
supremacy over the vast regions of the west and
north-west, felt himself free to consolidate and extend
the conquests of his first campaign. So in the year
731 he marched against the sacred city of Babylon
itself Here he seems to have met with no resistance,



NIMRUD INSCRIPTION OF TIGLATH-PILESER III 119
and, in the same way, Sippara, Niffer, Borsippa, and
other towns of importance submitted. Lastly, hav
ing subdued the Puqudu and other Aramaean and
Chaldaean tribes within the limits or on the borders
of Babylonia, he could justly style himself king of Sumir and Akkad.
The closing years of his reign appear to have
been peaceful — occupied, not improbably, by the
building operations of which we have a fragmentary
account in our inscription. He was succeeded in
727 by Shalmaneser IV.
The inscription here translated is on a tablet of
clay brought from Nimrud, and now (K3751) in the
British Museum. Much of it has been defaced, and
the conquests of the king are enumerated on a

THE ORACLE OF ISTAR OF ARBELA
Translated by Theo. G. Pinches
At the beginning of Esarhaddon's reign, he warred,
as shown by his annals, in a district called Khani
galbat, on the Upper Euphrates. As the record is
mutilated, it is not known against whom he fought,
but it is generally supposed that it was against the
troops of his two brothers, Adrammelech (Assur
munik or Assur-mulik) and Sharezer, who, after
having slain their father, had escaped into Armenia,
and now came (as is conjectured) to dispossess their
younger brother of the throne of Assyria, on which,
during their absence, the people had seated him.
At this time, evidently to encourage the young
king in his difficult task of winning to himself and
consolidating the kingdom, the following addresses,
purporting to be the utterances of his favourite
goddess, Istar of Arbela, Goddess of War, by the
mouths of the various people whose names are
attached to them, were sent to him. Esarhaddon
describes the success which attended his arms as
follows :

VOL. V K



130 RECORDS OF THE PAST
Pulukhti ilani rabiiti beli-ia t'skhup-sunutima tib takhazi-ia danni iviuru-ma ^mii makhkhur. Istar belit qabli takhazi rdimat sanguti-ia idda taziz-ma midpanat- sunu tasbir ; takhaza-sunu raksu tapdhur-ma ina pukhri-sunu iqbA umma: Annu sarani}
"The fear of the great gods, my lords, overwhelmed them, and they saw the onrush of my powerful attack, and inclined to retreat. Istar, lady of war (and) battle, lover of my priesthood, stood by my side, and broke their bows
;
she opened out their close battle(-formation), and in their assembly they cried out thus: 'This is our king.'"
Judging from this, Adrammelech and Sharezer
must have fled with a considerable force of
Assyrian soldiers, who, when they saw the battle
going against them, at once acknowledged Esar
haddon's claim. Esarhaddon's reverence for Istar
of Arbela, Goddess of Battle, is borne witness to
from the fact that he gives her the principal honour
of the defeat of his enemies,—really due, however
(judging from Esarhaddon's words), to an error in
generalship, namely, an open instead of a close
formation.
A translation of the Oracle was given by me in
the first series of the Records of the Past, vol. xi.,
thirteen years ago. The text has since then been
thoroughly revised, and is now published in the 4th
vol. of the Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia,
pi. 61 in the new edition and 68 in the old. Partly
' W. A. /. , iii. pi. 15, col. i. , lines 20-25.



THE ORACLE OF ISTAR OF ARBELA 131
in consequence of this revision, and partly in con
sequence of the advance made in the translation of
Assyrian texts, the rendering here given is much
improved. The Rev. A. Delattre, S.J., has also
translated and commented on the greater part of
the inscription.
With regard to the text itself, it is to be noted
that it is written on a large clay tablet, of which
about two-thirds are preserved, the lost portion
being the upper part of the obverse and the lower
part of the reverse. There are three columns on
each side. Each of the eight pronouncements of
the oracle is followed by a ruled line, after which
comes the name of the person by whom it was
uttered. A second ruled line follows, and then
comes the text of the next utterance of the oracle.
The first and the last utterances are by men, the
others by women, probably priests and priestesses
or votaries of Istar. Five of the oracle-utterers
(three women and two men) are of the city of
Arbela ; one, a woman, is of the city Darakhuya,'
" in the mountains" ; another, also a woman, is of
the city of Assur ; and a third is conjectured by the
Rev. A. Delattre to be a slave of the king.^ The
language of each utterance is very similar, notwith
standing that the text was composed by eight
different persons. It probably contains archaisms
^ Or Dara-^khd-ya, a name meaning, according to its form (but perhaps only a foll<-etymology), " (May) my brother live long." '^ See p. 139, note.



132 RECORDS OF THE PAST
and poetic words or phrases, though it shows also
many of the peculiarities of the despatch and letter
style.
The only unmistakable reference to a warlike
expedition is the mention of the crossing of the
river, in Column IV.^ With the usual obscurity of
oracle-utterances, however, the name of the river is
not given. The first utterance, on the other hand,
is, perhaps, a little better, for in lines 19-21^ we
have the following sentence :

Anaku Istar sa Arbd-ilu, Nakarute-ka, ukaa, adana-ka.
" I am Istar of Arbela
,
thine enemies, the ukaa I will give to thee."
Now, although there is no determinative prefix
before ukAa, showing it to be the name of a country
(or people), we may nevertheless take it as being
such, and as indicating the nation or tribe called the
UkAa or Ukkda, a people against whom Sargon and
Sennacherib fought, and who seem to have inhabited
a part of Armenia. It is also noteworthy that the
oracle containing this reference is placed first. The
omission of the determinative prefix may be regarded
as not altogether unintentional, for had Esarhaddon
been unsuccessful in Armenia, the oracle-utterer
would have defended himself by saying that the
word in question was not the name of the well
1 See p. 137. The Tigris is probably intended. " Page 134.



THE ORACLE OF ISTAR OF ARBELA 133
known nation of the Ukaa, but something entirely
different. Fortunately, though, for Esarhaddon (and
also, probably, for Istar-la-tasiat), he was more
fortunate than Croesus and Pyrrhus.
The Pythia Mimma-abi-sa is not improbably the same as the woman of that name mentioned in one
of Sennacherib's letters to his father Sargon,^ referring
to the situation at that time among the Ukkaa and
Armenia in general.

THREE DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE SONS OF NEBUCHADREZZAR
Translated by the Editor
The three documents of which translations follow are
included among the Babylonian " Contract-tablets,"
now in the British Museum, copies of which have
been published by Dr. Strassmaier. They will be
found in his Babylonische Texte, vi. ; Inschriften von
Nabuchodonosor, Nos. 372, 382, and 393. Their
interest lies in the references they make to two of
the sons of Nebuchadrezzar, Merodach-suma-utsur
(" O Merodach, defend the name") and Merodach
nadin-akhi (" Merodach has given a brother"). They
show us, moreover, that the members of the royal
family were not exempt from the obligation of paying
the tithe or esril to the Babylonian temples ; while
the second (No. 382) throws light on Babylonian
law so far as it related to slaves. The document,
however, is very difficult to translate, as our know
ledge of the legal terms used by the Babylonians is
still defective. The "tattle" to which allusion is
made is quite unknown.
Bit-Uri, " the house of light," was the great
temple of the Sun-god at Sippara. Its Sumerian
name seems to have been E-Babbara.

THE INSCRIPTIONS RELATING TO THE RISE OF CYRUS AND HIS CONQUEST OF BABYLONIA
Translated by the Editor
The three texts of which translations follow are of
the highest importance for the history of the fall of
Babylon and the rise of the Empire of Cyrus.
They cast a new and revolutionary light on the
character and nationality of Cyrus, as well as on
his conquest of Babylon. Cyrus and his ancestors
are shown in them to have been kings of Anzan or
Ansan, not of Persia, he and his son Cambyses, so
far from being Zoroastrian iconoclasts, conform to the
worship and ritual of Babylonia, and Babylon sur
renders to the invader " without fighting,'' instead of
undergoing the horrors of a siege.
All three texts were first discovered by Mr.
Pinches. The Cylinder inscription of Cyrus was
first published, with translation and commentary, by
Sir Henry Rawlinson in the Journal of the Royal
Asiatic Society, xii. i (1880). Subsequent translations of it have appeared by M. Hal^vy in the
Revue des J^tudes juives, No. i ; by myself in Fresh

Hommel in his Babylonisch-Assyrische Geschichte, pp.

printed in the Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia,
V. pi. 35, and again by Abel & Winckler in their
Keilschrifttexte, pp. 44 sq. The Annalistic Tablet of
Cyrus was published, with transliteration, translation,
and notes by Mr. Pinches in the Transactions of the
Society of Biblical Archceology, vii. i (1880), and
subsequently translated by myself in Fresh Light
from the Ancient Monuments, and by Prof. Schrader
in the Keilinschriftliche Bibliothek, iii. 2 (1890). The
cuneiform text has been printed in a revised form by
Dr. Winckler in his Untersuchungen zitr altorientalischen
Geschichte (1889), No. 5. Of the Cylinder inscrip
tion of Nabonidos, discovered by Mr. Hormuzd Rassam at Abu Habba or Sippara, more than one
copy exists. One of these is in the British Museum,
the other at Berlin. The text, restored by means
of duplicates, has been published in the Cuneiform
Inscriptions of Western Asia, v. pi. 64, and again,
according to the Berlin copy, in Abel and Winckler's
Keilschrifttexte, pp. 40-43. A translation of it has
been made by Latrille, together with a commentary,
in the Zeitschrift fur Keilschriftforschung, ii., and
Zeitschrift fiir Assyriologie, i. ( 1 8 8 5 -6), and also by Dr.
Peiser in the KeilinscriftlicJte Bibliothek, iii. 2 (1890).

difficulties to the translator. The Cylinder inscrip
tion of Cyrus is more difficult. This is mainly due
to the mutilated character of the text, but it is also
in some measure owing to our imperfect acquaintance
with the rules of Assyro-Babylonian syntax. It is
sometimes difficult, if not impossible, to determine
where a sentence ends or begins, and a double
translation of the passage consequently becomes
possible. Moreover, the construction of the sen
tences more than once reminds us of the language
of the later Hebrew prophets, and is open to the
same amount of disputable interpretation. The
inscription, in fact, is one of the most Hebraistic of
those which have come from Babylonia or Assyria,
and in one important particular twice adopts an
usage which is Hebraic and not Assyrian. This is
the employment of malku instead of sarru in the
sense of " king." Elsewhere in Assyrian and Baby
lonian literature malku signifies the prince who is
subordinate to the sarru or " king," whereas in
Hebrew it is the sar who is the subordinate prince,
the mclec/i who is the supreme king.
One of the first facts which strike us in reading
the texts is, that Cyrus and his immediate predecessors
were kings of Ansan, a name which is also written
Anzan in the older Assyrian inscriptions. It is not
until the ninth year of Nabonidos (B.C. 546) that
Cyrus receives the title of king of Persia. The
occupation of that country must, therefore, have
followed closely on the conquest of Astyages.



INSCRIPTIONS RELATING TO RISE OF CYRUS 147
Attempts have been made by writers who were
not Assyriologists to identify Ansan with the district
of Pasargada, the early capital of Persia. But the
cuneiform inscriptions leave little doubt as to the
approximate position of the locality. Ansan was a
country as well as a city, and, as in the case of
Assyria, the country must have taken its name from
the city which was its primitive capital. We first hear
of it in the Sumerian inscriptions of Telloh. Gudea
tells us that he had conquered " Ansan in the country
of Elam" {Records of the Past, New Series, ii. p. 82).
Ansan was accordingly situated in Elam, and it was
probably at no great distance from the Babylonian
frontier. Dr. Winckler^ has pointed out that another
Babylonian prince, Mutabil, the viceroy of Dur-ilu,
also claims to have " broken the head of the army
of Ansan." As Dur-ilu lay on the Elamite frontier,
we are again referred to Elam for the site of Ansan.
The question is placed beyond dispute, however, by
a lexical tablet, in which explanations are given of
obscure words and phrases in certain astrological
texts ( W. A. /., ii. 47, 1 8). Here we are told that
Ansan was the equivalent of the Semitic Elamti or
Elam. Elam, " the highlands," was the name given
by the Assyro-Babylonian Samites to the mountain
ous region on the east of Babylonia, which con
stituted the ancient kingdom of Elam, with its
capital Susa. Consequently the city of Ansan must
not only have been situated in Elam, but the country
^ Uniersuchungen, p. 116.



148 RECORDS OF THE PAST
of Ansan must have approximately corresponded
to the country which constituted the kingdom of Elam.
This conclusion is verified by the inscriptions of
the native kings of Susa. In these each calls him
self gik 'sioikik D. P. Anzan anin Susinak, " the lord
of the kingdom of Anzan, the Susian king." Dr.
Winckler maintains indeed that in this title the
word Anzan is an appellative, meaning " district,"
rather than a proper name ; but the supposition is
founded on the erroneous belief that the word is not
preceded by the determinative of locality. As a
matter of fact, wherever Susinak or Susunqa, " the
Susian," is preceded by the determinative, Anzan is
preceded by it too ; it is only where it is not attached
to Susunqa that it is also not written before Anzan.
Anzan and Susunqa, therefore, stand upon precisely
the same footing, and since every one allows that
Susun or Susa was a proper name, Anzan must have
been a proper name as well. The title is found, not
only in the inscriptions left by the Elamite kings in
the ruins of Susa, but also on their bricks which
have been found at Bushire, on the Persian Gulf; it
would, therefore, seem that the country designated
by the name extended from Susa in the north as far
as the shores of the sea.
A passage in the annals of Sennacherib bears
similar testimony. Here we read (Taylor's Cylinder,
V- 25-39): "As for him, the Elamite, whose cities
I had captured and reduced to ruins in the course



INSCRIPTIONS RELATING TO RISE OF CYRUS 149
of my former expedition against Elam, his heart
was not intelligent. He accepted the bribe (of the
Babylonians), and collected his army (and) his camp
;
he prepared chariots (and) wagons ; he harnessed
horses and mules to his yokes. The countries of
Par'suas, Anzan, Pasiru, and EUipi ; the tribes of
Yazan, Lagabra, and Khargunu ; the cities of Dum
muqu, 'Sula, and Samsamna ; the son of Merodach
baladan ; the countries of Bit-Adin, Bit-Amukkan,
Sillan, and S^la ; the cities of Larrak and Lakhiru ;
the tribes of Pekod, Gambul, Khalat, Ruhua, Ubul,
Malakh, Rapiqu, Khindaru, and Damunu, a great
confederacy, he summoned around him." In the
parallel passage of the Memorial Tablet (44-46) the
list is given more briefly : " Behind the king of
Elam, the countries of Par'suas, Anzan, and Ellipi,
all the land of the Kaldi and all the Aramaeans, a
great confederacy, he summoned around him, as
well as the king of Babylon."
As the king of Elam was at the head of the
confederacy, the country over which he ruled must
be one of those included in the list. It could not
have been Pasiru, the situation of which is unknown,
since this is not even mentioned in the duplicate
account, nor was it either Par'suas, the classical
Persis, or Ellipi, which corresponded to the Media
of later days. Nothing remains, therefore, but to
identify Elam with Anzan, as is done by the writer
of the lexical tablet mentioned above. The position
occupied by Anzan in the list, between Ellipi and



ISO RECORDS OF THE PAST
Par'suas, agrees exactly with that of the kingdom
of Elam.
Ansan, written in the Elamite fashion with the
Elamite phonetic value 'sa for the character du, is
furthermore alluded to in the astrological tablets
( W. A. /., iii. 60-67, 68). Reference is twice made
to " the king of Ansan and 'Subarti." Now the
name of 'Subarti (or more exactly 'Suwarti) repre
sented the district of Northern Mesopotamia known
as Mitanni to its inhabitants and Aram-Naharaim to
the Old Testament. The conquest of this district
by the king of Ansan can be explained only by the
western conquests of Elam, of which we have a record
in the 14th chapter of Genesis. We are thus again
brought back to the kingdom of Elam grown out of
the amalgamation of two independent principalities,
one of which had its seat at Susun or Susa, "the
ancient " city, the other at Anzan.^
Already, as long ago as 1880, Sir Henry Rawlin
son indicated the true situation of Anzan, and pointed
out that the name survived into the middle ages.
" There is a notice of Ass&n in a very early and
learned Arabic writer, Ibn-el-Nadim, who had un
usually good means of information as to genuine
Persian traditions. This writer ascribes the invention
of Persian writing to Jamshld, the son of Vivenghan
(who, with the Zoroastrians, was the Eponym of the
^ In an old geographical list Ansan is conjoined with the nomad tribes of the Markhasi and Khamar, the name of Elam following subsequently ;
see my article, "La Situation g^ographique d'Anzan," in the Mus^on, V. 4 {1886).



INSCHIPTIONS RELATING TO RISE OF CYRUS 151
Persian race), and adds that he, Jamshid, dwelt at
Assan, one of the districts of Tuster (modern Shuster).

Kitah-el-Fihrist, p. 12, 1. 22." Shuster or Tuster
represents the site of the ancient Susa. The city of
Anzan must probably be looked for to the south
west of Shuster, in the neighbourhood of the river
Karun.^
The genealogy of Cyrus agrees with that given
by Herodotos. His great-grandfather, Teispes, was
also the great-grandfather of Hystaspes, the father
of Darius. Assuming with Sir Henry Rawlinson that Teispes was the son of Akhsemenes, we must
explain the statement of Darius at Behistun that
" eight of his ancestors had been kings before him
in two lines, he himself being the ninth," ^ by sup
posing that Ariaramnes the son of Teispes " remained
in Persis when his father Teispes pushed on to Ansan ; and that he and his son Arsames may thus
have been kings in that province, though the next
descendant, Hystaspes, lost all independent power
on the rise of Cyrus the Great." ^ No objection can
be taken to this view on the ground that "the title
of king is not attached to the names of Ariaramnes
and Arsames at Behistun, since the very same objec
tion might be taken in regard to Teispes and Akhae
1 Sir Henry Rawlinson places it in the plain of Ram-Hormuz. Here, at a spot called Kal'at 'Arabin, Sir A. H. Layard heard of the existence of ancient inscriptions.
^ Spiegel's translation of the Persian text is, " Eight of my family were formerly kings, I am the ninth, in two branches are we kings."
^ See the table of Persian kings, Records of the Past, New Series, iii. p. 130.



152 RECORDS OF THE PAST
menes, both of whom were undoubtedly independent
monarchs." ^
The fact that Cyrus and his predecessors were
kings of Anzan and not of Persis throws light, not
only on the elevation of Susa to the rank of a
capital of the Persian Empire, but also on the
polytheistic tendencies of Cyrus and his successor
Kambyses. The first monotheistic Zoroastrian who
sat on the throne of the empire was Darius Hystas
pis. Cyrus had been brought up among the monu
ments and traditions of ancient Elamite polytheism,
and at the very outset of his career Nabonidos had
recognised in him the " little servant " of Merodach.
It is quite possible that his mother and grandmother
were of Elamite or Babylonian origin. His Cylinder
inscription, as well as the Annalistic Tablet, shows
how anxious he was to be regarded as the legitimate
successor of the Babylonian kings.
I have already explained who the Manda were
in the Preface to the third volume of the New Series
of Records of the Past, and suggested that they
represent the Nod of Genesis iv. 1 6, perhaps also the
Lud of Genesis x. 22. Dr. Winckler, following M.
Delattre, would identify them with the Skyths of
the Greek writers, who descended on the kingdom
of Kyaxares, saved Nineveh for a time from its
enemies, and carried fire and sword across Western
Asia as far as the shores of Palestine. In any case
it is a surprise to find that the well-known figure of
1 Rawlinson in the/. R. A, S., xii. i. pp. 74, 75.



INSCRIPTIONS DELATING TO RISE OF CYRUS 153
Astyag^s, or more correctly Astyigas, as the name
is Written by Kt^sias, does not belong to Median
history at all. The belief that he was king of
Media is due to the confusion made by the Greek
historians, or the sources from which they borrowed,
between the Babylonian words Mada, " Medes,'' and
Manda, " nomads." The confusion was assisted by
the fact that the Medes actually bordered on the
country which formed the centre of the power of
Astyages. We are told by Sargon that Bit-ili,
which seems to be the Assyrian form of the name
of Bagistana or Behistun, belonged to the Medes,
and was on the frontier of the land of Ellipi. Ellipi
was the district in which Ekbatana was afterwards
founded and the kingdom of the Manda had its
seat. We last hear of Ellipi in the time of Senna
cherib ; between then and the age of Cyrus it must
have fallen into the hands of the Manda. The
stories of the relation between Astyages and Cyrus
found in the classical writers, and based on the belief
that Astyages was a Median monarch, are thus
shown to be worthless. On the other hand, the
statement of Ktesias is confirmed that Cyrus, so far
from being the grandson of Astyages, was the son
of a Mardian bandit. The Mardians, called Amar
dians by Strabo (xi. p. 761), inhabited the range
of mountains which separated Persepolis from the
Persian Gulf, and extended northward as far as the
neighbourhood of Susa.
Perhaps the most startling revelation that has



IS4 RECORDS OF THE PAST
been made to us by the inscriptions of Cyrus is, that
there was no siege of Babylon, and that the siege
assigned to his reign by the historians of Greece
and Rome was really the siege which took place
in the reign of Darius. The siege has been ante
dated, and the king of Anzan whom a portion of
the Babylonian priests and people welcomed as an
avenger of their gods has been transformed into the
later Zoroastrian ruler of the Persian Empire.
The inscriptions make it clear that Nabonidos
had offended a considerable number of his subjects
by his efforts to centralise their worship at Babylon.
He thus laid himself open to the same charge as
that which was brought against Hezekiah (2 Kings
xviii. 22). Religious centralisation implied political
centralisation as well, and was a further carrying out
of the policy of transplantation which had caused the
Assyrian and Babylonian kings to transport the
populations of the countries they conquered to dis
tant regions of the world. It is probable that Cyrus
had received help in his attempt on Babylonia from
some of the disaffected exiles who had been planted
there, and among whom were the Jews. His experi
ence had thus taught him the danger of the policy ;
and, accordingly, one of his first acts after the conquest
of Nabonidos was to reverse it. The exiles, with the
images of their gods, were restored to their old homes ;
a source of internal disaffection was thus removed,
while the gratitude of the liberated captives made them
trustworthy guardians of the frontiers of the empire.



INSCRIPTIONS RELATING TO RISE OF CYRUS 155
The chronology of the reign of Cyrus has been in
great measure cleared up by the Annalistic Tablet
;
the Cylinder inscription of Nabonidos, on its side,
has further furnished us with valuable chronological
information relative to the early history of Babylonia.
It is from it that we know the date to which the
Babylonian historians of the time of Nabonidos
referred Sargon of Accad and his son Naram-Sin.
The remains of the Babylonian annals which have
been preserved, and which have been translated in
the first volume of the New Series of Records of the
Past, have shown us that the Babylonian antiquaries
were in possession of a fairly accurate chronological
register, and that we may consequently accept their
statements in regard to dates without much misgiv
ing. Equally important is the statement that
Sagasalti-buryas, the son of Kudur-Bel, reigned
800 years before the time of Nabonidos. The
statement is verified by the fragment of the Baby
lonian Chronicle published for the first time in this
volume by Mr. Pinches. Dr. Oppert may be right
in identifying the two princes with the mutilated
names of the 2Sth and 27th kings of the Kassite
dynasty given in the Dynastic Tablet, which is
translated in the first volume of this series (p. 16). The date of Khammurabi and of the first dynasty
of Babylon is thus thrown back by a full century
beyond that which I have assigned to it and dated
B.C. 2468-2174. Babylonian history must be con
sidered to begin with the year 2500 B.C.



1 56 RECOKDS OF THE PAST
In the inscriptions Babylon receives four names,
which have accordinglj' been indicated at the foot of
the page. The four names are E-Ki, DiN-TiR-Ki,
Ka-DIMIRRA-KI, and Su-ANNA-KI, where Kl is the Accadian affix of locality. The first name probably
signifies "the place of the water," or "the canal";
the second means " the place of the life of the tree ";
the third "the Gate of God"; and the fourth "the
place of the mound (?) of Anu." In the Cylinder of Cyrus Ka-DIMIRRA is also written Ka-DIMIRRA-MES,
" the Gate of the gods," the Semitic translation being
in each case Bab-ili. Su-ANNA was properly only
the particular quarter of Babylon in which the great
temple of 6-Saggil was situated, and seems to have
lain on the opposite side of the river to that occupied
by the quarter called Te or T^va. Hence it is
specially the sacred name of Babylon, and is used
when the gods are referred to. In the age of Nabo
nidos and Cyrus, the names E and DiN-TIR, or
rather their Semitic equivalent, Babilu, were used
indifferently, though possibly they originally denoted
two separate villages, from the amalgamation of
which Babylon subsequently arose. In a lexical
tablet DiN-TIR is punningly interpreted " the seat of
life '' ; the true signification, however, is " life of the
tree," which may either allude to some legend of a
sacred tree or to the palm-groves which flourished
on its site. Ka-DIMIRRA or Babilu, Babel, was the
most general designation under which the city was
known, and came to prevail to the exclusion of all



INSCRIPTIONS RELATING TO RISE OF CYRUS 157
Others. But there are passages in the inscriptions
which show that in the sixth century before our era
it was synonymous with E and DiN-TlR. In fact, it
is probable that the distinction between the three
names was at that time preserved only in writing.

PREFACE
With the present volume the New Series of the
Records of the Past comes to an end. The public
seems to prefer books about the ancient inscriptions
of the Oriental world rather than translations of the
inscriptions themselves, and it would therefore be un
desirable to continue to publish them. The curiosity
excited by the first attempts at the decipherment
of the Egyptian and Assyrian texts appears now to
be satisfied, and even students of the Old Testament
are contented to allow questions which bear directly
on Biblical history and interpretation to be settled
by the small but enthusiastic body of workers in
the fields of Egyptian and Assyrian research.
And yet an interest in the old monuments of the
civilised East is no longer confined to the nations of
the west. Egyptians, as is fitting, have begun to ex
amine for themselves the past records of their own
country, and the last volume of the Zeitschrift fiir
Assyriologie contains a learned and valuable article
by a Japanese Assyriologist (Mr. Le Gac) on one of
the oldest Sumerian texts which the soil of Babylonia
has bequeathed to us.



PREFACE
But whether the public remains interested or
indifferent the work of discovery goes on. It is
upon the students of the cuneiform texts more espe
cially that new facts are crowding year by year. In
the present volume will be found translations of a
new series of cuneiform documents which reveal the
existence of an Assyrian dialect in the highlands of
eastern Asia Minor in the age of the Hebrew exodus.
It is only ten years ago that the sagacity of Mr.
Pinches discovered that such documents existed at
all, and it is only now that their decipherment has
become possible.
In my Address to the Assyriological Section of
the Oriental Congress of 1892 I drew attention to
the light which Assyrian research is beginning to
throw even upon later Greek history. Among the
astronomical tablets of the Seleukid period which
have been copied and published by Dr. Strassmaier
is one which is dated in " the 37th year of Antiochus
and Seleucus the kings," that is to say, in 275 B.C.
In the previous year it is stated that the king
collected his troops and marched to the country of
'Sapardu, the Sepharad of Obadiah 20, which a
comparison of the account with what we learn from
Greek writers would show to have corresponded with
the Bithynia and Galatia of classical geography. It
seems that Antiochus left a garrison there, in order
to face the Egyptian army at the ford of the river
Rfldu. The Egyptian army, however, crossed the
stream. A few days later the mumahir^ or " governor,"



PREFACE VU
of Babylonia forwarded silver, furniture, and girls from
Babylonia and Seleukia, " the royal city," as well as
"20 elephants which the governor of Baktria {Bakh
tar) had sent to the king," to meet the king " at the
ford of the river." The royal body-guard was left
in Babylonia " from the beginning to the end of the
month." During the same year taxes were raised
in Babylon and the other cities of the kingdom for
the payment of " the Greek loan," ^ and there was
much sickness in the country.
The first event which marked the beginning of
the new year was the return of " the governor of
Babylonia and the royal body-guard, which had gone
to 'Sapardu to meet the king the previous year, to
Seleukia, the royal city, which lies upon the Tigris."
On the twelfth day of the month the inhabitants of
Babylon were transported to the new city of Seleukia,
and the people of Babylon, Borsippa, and Cutha
provided oxen, sheep, and other things, while a royal
palace was built at Seleukia. Bricks were also made
above and below Babylon in order to build a temple,
apparently in the same city. The temple was called
]£-Saggil, like the ancient temple of Bel-Merodach at
Babylon, which had been destroyed by the Persian
kings. Mention is further made of " Lumusu the
brother of King Seleucus."
All these facts are new, and are welcome additions
to our knowledge of the history of Macedonian
Syria. Even the date of the foundation of Seleukia
1 Ana pi zipi sa mat Yavannu. Zipi is the Talmudic zAph.



vill PREFACE
has not hitherto been known with certainty, much
less the fact that its population was brought from
Babylon. It is clear that a determined effort was
made by the new dynasty to destroy the memory of
the ancient glory and supremacy of Babylon, and to
replace it by a new capital.
Equally unknown were the details of the war
which Antiochus carried on in Asia Minor. All we
knew was that he was engaged in a struggle, first of
all with Nikomedes of Bithynia and then with the
Gauls in the early part of his reign (276, 275 B.C.).
It was the defeat of the Gauls in Galatia in 275
B.C. which procured for the Syrian king the title of
Sdter. Nor was the position of the Sepharad of
Obadiah accurately determined. Certain reasons
existed for placing it in the neighbourhood of the
Black Sea, but it is only now that we know it must
have corresponded to the Bithynia and Galatia of
the Greeks. We need, therefore, no longer hesitate
about identifying it with the Persian satrapy of
Sparda mentioned in .the Akhsemenian inscriptions.
At Behistun the name of Sparda immediately pre
cedes that of Yauni or Ionia, and it is described as
situated " by the sea," while at Naksh-i-Rustem it is
enumerated between Kappadokia and Ionia. It will
thus have represented central Asia Minor, more especi
ally the district on the western bank of the Halys.
It will be remembered that in the texts relating
to the last days of the Assyrian empire, which I have
described and partially translated in the preface to the



PREFACE ix
fourth volume of this Series, reference is made to the
'Sapardi, or people of 'Sapardu. They seem to have
united with the Medes, the Minni, and the Kimmerians
in attacking the tottering power of Nineveh, which was
accordingly assailed by a league of all the nations
of the north. We are irresistibly reminded of the
description given by Ezekiel (xxxviii., xxxix.) of the
army of Gog, as well as of the northern confederacy
which is called upon to punish Babylon in the fifty
first chapter of Jeremiah. Though the prophecies in
question may belong to a later date than that of the
fall of the Assyrian empire the political situation they
presuppose is the same as that which witnessed the
overthrow of Nineveh.
A discovery made this summer by Mr. Strong
goes to show that the movement of the northern and
eastern nations which brought about the destruction
of the Assyrian power had begun while Assur-bani
pal was still on the throne. In an inscription which
appears to belong to the latter part of his reign he
alludes to the successes of his army against the
Manda chieftain Tuktamme, whom he calls " the
offspring of Tiamat." So strong an expression —of
which the nearest English equivalent would be " a
limb of Satan "— proves better than any description
how formidable the predecessor of Istuvegu or
Astyages must have been. It is possible that in
Tuktamme we have the original of the Hellenised
Teutamos, who, according to Ktesias, sent Memnon
from Susa to the help of Priam of Troy.
b



X PREFACE
Greek history, however, has not been the only
gainer by the Assyriological discoveries of the present
year. A discovery has been made which rivals in
interest any that have ever taken place at any time
in the history of Oriental archeology. Guided by the
Assyriologist the excavator has put his spade into
the soil of Palestine and found the first-fruits of a
Canaanitish library which existed before Moses was
born.
The name of Kirjath-Sepher, or " Book-town,"
coupled with certain other considerations, long ago
led me to believe that libraries of cuneiform tablets,
similar to those of Assyria and Babylonia, were to
be discovered in Palestine. The discovery of the
tablets of Tel el-Amarna raised this belief almost
to a certainty. Immediately after my first visit to
southern Palestine in 1880 I urged the Committee
of the Palestine Exploration Fund to excavate some
of the tels which I had examined there, and which
clearly contained the ruins of pre-Israelitish towns.
But it was not until 1890 that the Fund was able
to obtain the necessary firman, and to engage the
services of Dr. Flinders Petrie in the work of ex
ploration. Excavations were accordingly commenced
at a tel or mound known as Tell el-Hesy, and during
the short space of time Dr. Petrie was able to devote
to the work results of wide-reaching importance were
obtained. In the first place, he was able to show
that Tell el-Hesy occupies the site of the Jewish
fortress of Lachish, and in the second place, to found



PREFACE
what may be termed the science of Palestinian
chronology. With the help of the dated pottery he
had discovered in Egypt he succeeded in arranging
the ancient pottery of Palestine in a chronological
sequence, so that we can now tell at a glance whether
it belongs to the period of the Judges or of the Kings,
to the pre-Israelitish period or to the age after the
Exile. Furnished with this clue, Dr. Petrie pointed
out that the lowermost portion of Tell el-Hesy repre
sents the ruins of a city which was destroyed by the
invading Israelites.
Here then we had found the remains of the
Amorite city of Lachish, and though these remains
were covered to a great height with the debris of the
subsequent cities which rose one above the other
upon the site, all that was needed for their systematic
excavation were an excavator and the necessary
funds. Mr. Bliss offered to continue Dr. Petrie's
work, and after two seasons of unremitting labour
his efforts have been crowned with success.
Admitting, as I did, the truth of Dr. Petrie's
conclusions, I felt convinced that sooner or later we
should find a collection of clay tablets inscribed with
cuneiform characters similar to those which have
been found at Tel el-Amarna. Clay does not perish,
except by the hand of man, and the Tel el-Amarna
tablets had shown that an Egyptian governor resided
in the Amorite city of Lachish who wrote, and there
fore must have received, cuneiform despatches on
clay. His name was Zimridi or Zimrida; and among



xii PREFACE
the Tel el-Amarna tablets now in Berlin ^ is a letter
addressed by him to the Egyptian Pharaoh. The
letters runs as follows :
" To the king my lord, my gods, my Sun-god,
the Sun-god who is from heaven, thus (writes) Zim
ridi, the governor of the city of Lachish. Thy
servant, the dust of thy feet, at the feet of the king
my lord, the Sun-god from heaven, bows himself
seven times seven. I have very diligently listened
to the words of the messenger whom the king my
lord has sent to me, and now I have despatched (a
mission) according to his message."
In one of the letters of Ebed-tob, King of Jeru
salem, which I have translated in the last volume of
the Records of the Past (p. 70, lines 43, 44), allusion
is made to this Zimrida. It is there said that he
had been murdered by the servants of the Egyptian
king.
It was while Mr. Bliss was closing his work for
the season, towards the beginning of last June, that
his first discoveries were made in the Amorite stra
tum in the mound of Lachish. Egyptian beads and
scarabs were brought to light which belonged to the
age of the Eighteenth Dynasty, and on one of the
beads is the name and title of Queen Teie, the wife
of Amendphis III. and the mother of Amenophis
IV., to whom the correspondence of Tel el-Amarna
was addressed. At the same time there was also
discovered a number of seal-cylinders, one of them

PREFACE XIU
of Egyptian porcelain and manufacture, others im
portations from Babylonia, where they would have
been made between 2000 and 1500 B.C., while others
again are rude imitations of Babylonian models which
resemble similar rude imitations found in the pre
historic tombs of Cyprus as well as in Syria. The
date of the latter has now been fixed by Mr. Bliss's
discovery.
The interest, however, attaching to the beads and
cylinders is far exceeded by the last discovery of
the season. A clay tablet was disinterred, similar
in form and size to those found at Tel el-Amarna
which had been sent to Egypt from southern Pales
tine. As the tablet itself was claimed by the Turkish
commissioner, impressions and squeezes of it only
were sent to me. These, however, have enabled me
to make a fairly complete copy of the text. It turns
out to be one of the letters which were received at
Lachish and stored up in the archive-chamber of the
city about the very time that Zimrida's letter to the
Pharaoh was being written. The cuneiform characters
used in it have the peculiar forms to which the tablets
from southern Palestine discovered at Tel el-Amarna
have now accustomed us ; the formula; and curious
grammatical forms which it employs are the same as
those of the letters from the south of Canaan, and
above all, the name of the Egyptian governor of
Lachish, Zimrida, is twice mentioned in it.
Nothing more extraordinary has ever happened
in the annals of archaeology. The discovery had



PREFACE
hardly been made that a governor of Lachish named
Zimrida wrote letters in the Babylonian language
and syllabary to his suzerain the Pharaoh of Egypt
when the site of Lachish was identified by Dr. Petrie,
and a letter similar to those of Zimrida was found by
Mr. Bliss in which the name of Zimrida twice occurs.
For more than 4000 years the broken halves of a
correspondence that was carried on before the days of
the Exodus had thus been lying under the soil, the
one half on the banks of the Nile, the other half in
Canaan ; and the recovery of the one from its long
continued oblivion was followed almost immediately
by the recovery of the other.
Until the original text of the Lachish tablet can
be examined it will be impossible to determine with
certainty some of the characters on it that are either
partly obliterated or else written on the edges of the
tablet. Moreover, there are certain words in the text
which appear for the first time, and of which, there
fore, the interpretation is at present doubtful. In the
following translation, therefore, which I offer of the
inscription there are necessarily several lacunae and
notes of interrogation :— ^
1 The following is a transliteration of the text so far as I can make it out :

J..



PREFACE XV
" To the officer say : I, Bal (?)..., [the son of
Zimrida ?] my father, prostrate myself at thy feet.
Verily thou knowest that Badu (?) and Zimrida the
chiefs (?) of the city have gone forth (?), and Dan
Hadad says to Zimrida my father : The city of
Yarami has sent to me [and] has given me 3 (?)
pieces of wood and 3 slings and 3 falchions. If I
remain over the country of the king and it acts
against me and there is slaughter so that I die
{literally until my death), in regard to thy . . . which
I have . . . from the enemy . . . , and I have
despatched Bel(?)-banila, and . . rabi-ilu-yuma[khir]
has sent his brother to this country to [strengthen
it ?]."
The importance of this text lies rather in what it
implies than in the statements it actually contains.
It is clear that Mr. Bliss is at the entrance of the
archive-chamber of the Amorite city of Lachish, and
in a few months hence we may expect to have in
our hands a Canaanitish library which existed before
the Promised Land had been invaded by the tribes
of Israel. Doubtless the contents of the library will
consist mainly of letters and despatches, but the
tablets found at Tel el-Amarna have taught us that
they will also probably include mythological and

even historical texts. Who knows, then, what reve
lations may not be in store for us ? We are, as it
were, about to dig up the sources of Genesis, and so
settle many of those burning questions which at
present divide the critics of the Pentateuch into
hostile camps.
It may be that we shall also find among the
archives of Lachish comparative dictionaries which
will throw light on the ancient language or languages
of Canaan. At all events the excavations of Dr.
Flinders Petrie at Tel el-Amarna last winter have
not only shown that the fellahin spoke the truth
when they declared that the famous tablets had been
found in the ruins of a building on the eastern side
of the royal palace, but they have further brought
to light fragments of other tablets, among which are
veritable dictionaries. In one case the dictionary
is of Semitic Babylonian and Sumerian, and as the
Sumerian words are written phonetically as well
as ideographically it would appear that Sumerian
must still have been a living tongue.^ In another
case the Babylonian words are given in explanation
of words belonging to two other languages, one of
which Mr. Boscawen thinks is Old Egyptian.
When the fragments discovered by Dr. Petrie are
published the whole of the Tel el-Amarna collection
will at last be at the disposal of scholars. Even the

PREFACE xvu
tablets contained in the British Museum have now
been published, though the translations and explana
tions proposed for them by the editors leave much
to be desired. In one instance the misinterpretation
brings with it serious historical consequences, as it
implies that Edom formed part of the Egyptian
empire, whereas in reality the letter in question states
explicitly that it did not. It is therefore advisable
to give a correct translation of the text. The tablet
is numbered 64. " To Yankhame my lord say thus : I Mut-Hadad
thy servant at the feet of my lord prostrate myself.
Since Mut-Hadad has declared in thy presence that
Ayab ^ has fled, and it is certified (?) that the king

wait of the king his lord, let the king my lord live,
let the king my lord live ! If Ayab has been in this
city of Bitilim for [the last] two months, I pray thee
ask Ben-enima, ask . . tadu, ask Isuya. Until after
the arrival of the god Merodach the city of Astarti
(Ashtaroth-Karnaim) has been assisted, because all
the fortresses of the foreign land are hostile, namely,
the cities of Udumu (Edom), Aduri (Addar), Araru, Mestu, Magdalim (Migdol), Khinianabi (fen han

an " enemy " here, as the Editors of the British Museum volume imagine,

XVlll PREFACE
this (messenger) to him {i.e. Ayab) (to wait) until
after thy arrival from thy journey, and he reached
the city of Bitilim and heard the news."
It is clear from this letter that whereas " the
plateau of Bashan," as it is elsewhere called, with
its city of Ashtaroth (or rather Ashtoreth) Karnaim,
was subject to Egypt, Edom and its fortified towns
had maintained their independence.
If we turn from the western limit of Babylonian
influence to the eastern frontier of Chaldaea we shall
find that here too there have been archaeological
gains during the past year. Mr. de Morgan, whose
appointment as Director of the Gizeh Museum will
be gratifying to all friends of science, has succeeded
in taking squeezes of the inscription of Ser-i-Pul,
discovered many years ago by Sir Henry Rawlinson,
as well as in discovering and copying another in
scription near Sheikh-Khan, sixty-seven miles distant
from the first. Ser-i-Pul is at the entrance to the
Pass of Holwan, leading into the ancient kingdom of
Media, and the inscription, which is in archaic Baby
lonian characters, is a memorial of Anu-banini, " the
king of Lulubi." The monument thus fixes the
position of the country of Lulubi so often referred to
in the Assyrian texts.^
In a more southerly direction Mr. Pognon, the
French Consul at Bagdad, has discovered the posi

tion of another country mentioned on the cuneiform monuments. This was Asnunnak or Umlias. Mr.
Pognon has found there the records of four
Patesis or High-priests, who once bore rule in the
country and erected various buildings, three of them
being named Ibal-pel—a name which reminds us of
the Amraphel of Genesis— Ur-Nin-gis-zida, and Qul
laqu (?).^
It only remains for me to thank my contributors
for the valuable help they have rendered me in the
preparation of this series of the Records of the Past,
and for the labour they have expended in bringing
an accurate knowledge of the monuments of the
ancient East within the reach of the modern reader.
Two of them, alas ! are no more. The last hours of
Mr. Arthur Amiaud and Mr. George Bertin were
spent in the work to which they had devoted their
lives, and almost the last of their contributions to
science were made for the Records of the Past. To
Professor Maspero my obligations are great ; not
only has he freely placed the most matured results of
his Egyptological work at my disposal, he has further
assisted me by his advice and encouragement in
those departments of Oriental learning in which he
is without a rival.
The new story of the Creation from Sumerian
Babylonia which has been discovered and translated
by Mr. Pinches fitly ends the series of Assyrian texts.
It must form the starting-point of fresh investigations
' See the Musion for June 1892.



XX PREFACE
into the character and origin of the Biblical narrative
in the earlier chapters of Genesis, and in connection
with the story of the Creation which I have translated
in the first volume opens up unexpected points of
view for the Biblical critic.
Before concluding, however, I have to note a mis
print in the translation of another of the many frag
ments of antiquity the discovery of which we owe to
Mr. Pinches. In the passage from the Babylonian
Chronicle published in the last volume (p. 107, line
5), the name " Kadisman-Murus " should be corrected
into " Kara-Murdas." The misprint is obvious, and
the translator and editor can only plead as an excuse
for it that " it is human to err."

HISTORICAL INSCRIPTIONS OF RAMESES III.
Translated by Professor August Eisenlohr
The First Series of the Records of the Past contained
in vol. vi. and vol. viii. three texts of the reign of
Rameses III., firstly (vol. vi. 17 ff.), the address of the
god Amon Ra to the king and the names of the
vanquished nations, who are fettered with cords
grasped by the hand of the god and his companion,
the local goddess of Thebes, taken from the ist
pylon of Medinet Habu (left side) ; secondly, the
great Papyrus Harris, of whose 79 leaves the five last
(vol. viii. p. 45 ff.) are of the highest importance for
the age of Rameses III., as they teach us that his
father, Seti-nekht, made an end of a state of political
and religious anarchy, and that Rameses himself,
after having defeated the Daanauna, the Zakaru,
the Pulsata, the Shardana, and Uashash on the sea
coast, subdued the tribes of the Bedouin and re
pulsed the Libyan populations on the west side,
bringing the land to a state of tranquillity and wel
fare : the third article (vol. viii. p. 5 3 ff.) gave the
VOL. VI B



RECORDS OF THE PAST
translation, by Mr. Le P. Renouf, of a criminal
proceeding in a case of a harem conspiracy under
Rameses III. The time of this remarkable king, whose mummy
was found at Der el-bahri, enclosed in the coffin of
Queen Nofretari, whose sarcophagus of rose granite
is at the Louvre, the broken lid at Cambridge, ap
peared to be fixed by the mention, in a calendar on
the southern wall at Medinet Habu, of the (heliacal)
rising of the star Sirius on the first day of the month
Thoth, so giving as the date of the calendar the
year 1 3 1 8 B.C. Nevertheless, if the dates of the
festivals mentioned in this calendar do not belong to
the common vague year, but to the holy or fixed
year (so H. Brugsch and Dr. Mahler), and if we
have, after Diimichen, in this calendar only the exact
copy of a calendar of Rameses the Great, whose
fragments are embedded in the north-eastern pylon of
Medtnet Habu, no conclusion can be drawn from the
mention of the rising of Sirius.
If the fragmentary calendar of Elephantine,^ dating
the rising of Sirius on the 28th of Epiphi, really be
longs to Thothmes III., giving him the date of 1470
B.C., the probably twelfth year of Rameses III. can
hardly be 1 3 1 8 B.C., as there are between these two
monarchs a whole series of kings, several with high
ciphers attached to their reigns, as Amenophis III.
(38 years), Rameses the Great {6'j years), and after
them the above mentioned long period of internal

HISTORICAL INSCRIPTIONS OF RAMESES III 3
troubles. The date of 1450 B.C., offered by the
Assyro-Babylonian chronology for the contemporaries
and correspondents of Amenophis IV., seems just as
Httle compatible with 13 18 for Rameses III.
Though we do not deny that the description of
the exploits of Rameses III. on stone and papyrus
is somewhat exaggerated, it is not to be doubted
that in his reign Egypt was still a powerful and
formidable nation. As a proof we quote the re
markable passage of the great Harris Papyrus
(PI. ix. I ff.), where the king speaks of his building a
temple in the land of Kanana, to which the nations
of the Retennu came with their tributes for the gods.
As we learn from some hieratic inscriptions at
Silsileh {Denkm. vi. 23), Rameses III. built in the
fifth year of his reign the castle and temple of
Medinet Habu, dedicated it to the god Ammon, and
called it by the name of the House of Millions of
Years, in Am-uart (" great abode ") of Thebes. The
walls of this building he filled with pictures and
inscriptions of his deeds. We shall give in the
following pages a short description of these texts,
from which we select the most important in their
chronological order.
On the eastern front of the palace, beneath two
gigantic representations of the king slaughtering his
enemies before Harmakhis (right side) and Amon Ra
(left side), we see the kneeling figures of the princes
of the principal foes of Rameses III., with their arms
bound behind the back ; at the right side his Asiatic



RECORDS OF THE PAST
enemies—the Kheta, the Amaro, the Zakaru, the
Shardana, the Sha[su], the Tuirsha and the Pu[lsata],
all with their characteristic faces and headdresses ;
and at the left side, in symmetrical arrangement, the
African nations ; Kush, [ ], the Libu, the Tursas,
the Mashuash, and the Tarau.
At the inner side of the passage, on the left, the
king, equipped with bow and quiver, brings to the god
Amon two series of fettered prisoners, who exhibit a
very strange manner of curling the hair.
Similar representations of vanquished prisoners
are inside the doorway, and at the back of that
building which some call a pavilion, others a palace.
Much richer in representations as in inscriptions
is the temple itself, which is situated some two
hundred and sixty feet behind the palace. The
first pylon exhibits at both extremities two colossal
pictures : on the left (Diimichen, Hist. Inschr. i. pi.
xi. xii.) the god Amon Ra handling the shopesh with
a ram's head, and leading six series of prisoners with
their names in crenellated shields. They are pre
ceded by the local goddess of Thebes. On the right
side we see (Dum. loc. cit. xvi. xvii. ; Denkmdler, iii.
2io,«) similarly the god Amon Ra Harmakhis, with the head of a hawk, handling a hawk-headed shopesh
and conducting nine series of fettered prisoners.
These representations are accompanied by texts, of
which the left one has been translated by Birch,
Records of the Past, First Series, vi. pp. 19, 20. The
really poetic text on the right wing is as follows :



HISTORICAL INSCRIPTIONS OF RAMESES III 5
Spoken by Amon Ra Harmakhis :—My beloved son of
my body, lord of both lands, Usermara-mer-amon, lord of the sword over every country, the lands of the Anu Khent lie down slain under thy feet. I let come to thee the chiefs of the southern countries with their tributes, their children on their backs, all fine offerings of their country. Thou givest breath (according) to thy wish unto them. Thou killest those whom thy heart desires. I turn my face to the North and I charm for thee, I present to thee the red land under thy sandals, thou crushest hundreds of thousands to corpses, thou smitest down the Harusha by thy valiant sword. I let come to thee the countries which did ignore Egypt, with their baskets, laden with gold, silver, genuine lapis lazuli, all precious stones, the selection of the divine land before thy beautiful face. I turn my face to the East and I charm for thee, I subjugate them to thee, their totality combined in thy fist. I have collected for thee all the things of Punt, their tributes on gum of balm, precious (and) odoriferous, all woods pleasant of scent for thy face, for thy diadem, being on thy head. I turn my face to the West and I charm for thee, I destroy for thee the lands of Tehennu, they come incUned to thee, imploring, prostrated on their feet, they shout to thee. I turn my face to the height and I charm for thee, they are hailing thee, (even) the gods of the horizon of the heaven born at the morning. Thou germinatest like [OsiRis] ; he brings justice. I turn my face to the earth and I charm for thee, I procure for thee the victory over all countries, they are rejoicing for thee, (even) the gods in the heaven ; Hut giving to thee his arms on a fresh great place as seat of thy face, son of Ra, Rameses-hek-An.
Nearer to the doorvs^ay on both sides of the pylon
are smaller pictures, the king striking the prisoners
before Ptah (on the left) and before Amon Ra.
Beneath is a row of fettered prisoners, with their
names on erenellated shields. Below each series is



RECORDS OF THE PAST
a rather long stele, the left one dated in the twelfth
year of Rameses III., and, as Dr. Lepsius discovered,
an imitation of the stele of Rameses II. at Abu Simbel
{Denkm. iii. 194), containing a dialogue between the
god Ptah and the king. The other stele belongs to
the eleventh year. A good copy of both sides is to be
found in Diimichen, Hist. Inschr. i. pi. vii.-x., and pi.
xiii.-xv. ; the two stelae are also in De Roug6, Inscrip
tions, ii. pi. cxxi.-cxxvi. (stele of year xii.), and pi.
cxxxi.-cxxxviii. The stele of the year xi. is partly
translated by Chabas, Etudes sur I'antiq. historique,
2'""" Edition, p. 237 sq. The contents of the stelae
are mere phrases, except the conclusion of that of
the year xi., where the defeat of the army of the
Libyan chief Kapur is described, as well as the sub
mission of himself and his son.
The back of the first southern pylon contains texts
of the eleventh year of King Rameses III., treating
of the submission of the Temhu and the Mashuash
(a Libyan tribe). The king in his chariot is shoot
ing at his enemies (Diim. Hist. Insclir. i. pi. 18, 19 ;
De Roug6, Inscript. cxiv.-cxvii. ; Banville, Alb. phot.
pi. 78). Probably the long text of the northern
pylon (Diim. loc. cit. pi. 20-27) records the events
of the same year, together with the register of the
booty obtained during it. We shall translate this
text under No. III.
Between the first and the second pylon are two
colonnades, the left one supported by pillars, the right
one by Osiris-caryatides. On the back wall of the



HISTORICAL INSCRIPTIONS OF RAMESES III 7
latter is an illustration of the capture of the town
of Amaro by the king, who is shooting from his
chariot. On the left wall of the second pylon
which next follows, the king leads three series of
fettered prisoners before Amon Ra. From the in
scriptions we infer that these are the Daanauna (the
Danaans) and the Pulsata (the Philistines). The
whole of the right wall of the pylon is covered with
a long inscription of the eighth year, which was
cleared and first published by Mr. Greene {Fouilles a
Thebes, Paris, 1855), described by E. de Roug^
{AthencBum frangais, 1855 ; Notice de quelques textes
hieroglyph, r^ceminent publics par Mr. Greene^, after
wards published in Banville's Album photographique,
pi. y6, yj, and in many other photographs, and trans
lated by Chabas, Etudes sur I'ant. hist, 2nd ed. p.
246 sq. We shall give further on (No. II.) a revised
translation of this remarkable text.
The peristyle court of the temple of Medinet
Habu, which we next enter, exhibits under its colon
nade an illustration of two high festivals — the
festival of the god Khem on the northern side, and
that of the god Sokar on the southern. But besides
this, the south-eastern and southern walls contain
representations of the wars against the Libyan tribes,
especially the Libu themselves, the Mashuash, etc.
These representations are well given in the great works
of Champollion and Rosellini (Champ. Monuments,
pi. 2o8 = Ros. Man. reali, 138; Champ. 207 = Ros. 137; Champ. 20S=Ros. 136; Champ. 2o6 = Ros.



RECORDS OF THE PAST
135). Next to these representations is the long
text of 75 lines, whose translation we give under
No. I. The outward northern wall of the temple
contains again illustrations of the war of the king
and of a lion hunt. In his letters from Egypt and
Nubia (Paris, 1833) Champollion has given an
account of these representations (p. 352 ff.), which
we have repeated in Baedeker's Upper Egypt, p.
183 ff. Here also the defeat of the Mashuash and
the Libu is referred to, and also that of the Shardana
and Zakaru, who entered the mouths of the Nile,
and were annihilated by the Egyptian fleet and
army. The picture of this naval combat is highly
remarkable, and illustrates well the events recorded
in the inscription of the year 8, 1. 24, No. II.
Also, on the western bank of the Nile, at Karnak
are memorials of the combats of Rameses III.
Besides the scanty remains of a small temple near
the sacred lake of Muth (Z on Lepsius's map, U
in that in Baedeker's Upper Egypt), where the land
of Tahi is mentioned and a summing up of the spoil
is given, in the first court of the great temple of
Amon, at a right angle to the axis of the temple,
there is a well-preserved sanctuary, which, according
to an inscription, dates from the sixteenth year of
the king. Here also the king is slaying his enemies,
whom the god conducts in crenellated shields. These
representations are given in Lepsius's Dciikni. Abth.
iii. 207.

From the Fifth Year of Rameses III. (Hek An)
IN 75 Vertical Lines
As we said above, the south-west wall and the
adjoining part of the south-east wall of the great
peristyle court at Medinet Habu contain in their
upper register the representation of the festival of
Ptah-Sokar-Osiris, while the lower register is filled
with battle scenes and offerings of prisoners to the
god Amon of Thebes. There are recorded the
Temhu and the Mashuash, then the Tehennu and
the Libu, whose cut hands and members are
counted, by several thousands, by the scribes before
the king standing in his chariot. Close to this
scene follows an inscription of 75 lines, as far as
the west corner ; it is written retrograde, that is
to say, the characters are not turned towards the
beginning, but towards the end of the inscription.
The inscription has been published several times,
first by Burton {Excerpta hieroglyphica, 1825-30,
pi. 43-45), then by Rosellini {Monumenti reaH, pi.
139-141), DUmichen {Historische Inschriften, ii. taf.

p. 1 197 ff.). I myself copied the inscription on my
first journey to Egypt in 1 869-70, which copy I revised
afterwards in 1885 and 1890. According to my
copies I translated the text, a part of which exists
also in a fine photograph by H. Bechard. Mr.

THE LISTS OF THE PLACES IN NORTHERN SYRIA AND PALESTINE CONQUERED BY RAMSES II. AND RAMSES III.
By the Editor
By way of completing the geographical lists which
have been published by Mr. Tomkins in the last
volume of the Records of the Past (New Series, vol. v.
pp. 25-53), I give here the similar lists which Ramses
II. of the Nineteenth Dynasty and Ramses III. of
the Twentieth caused to be inscribed in imitation of
their predecessor of the Eighteenth. In editing the
lists prepared by Mr. Tomkins I added some com
parisons from the list of Ramses III. published by
Diimichen ; since doing so I have collated Diimi
chen's copies with the originals, and have found that
they are not in all cases correct.
The lists of Ramses II. were engraved partly on
the inside of the great pylon at Karnak, partly on
the southern wall of that temple, to the left of the
text of the treaty with the King of the Hittites.
Another list of the same Pharaoh, shockingly muti
lated, has been found during the recent excavations
on the exterior of the western wall of the temple of



RECORDS OF THE PAST
Luxor. Ramses III. has also left a short list of
names at Karnak, but his chief list is to be found
on the eastern face of the great pylon of the temple
palace which he built at Medinet Habu to com
memorate his victories.
A few of the names in the latter list were
published, but incorrectly, by De Roug^. Dumichen
subsequently copied all that were visible, and they
appeared in his Historische Inschriften, plates vii. xii.
xiii. and xvii. Excavation has now laid nearly all of
them bare, and last winter I made copies of them, with
the help of Mr. Wilbour. The copies of Dumichen
have to be emended in several points, but they are
accurate on the whole, though the new names which
have to be added to them are very numerous.
The list given by Ramses II. on the inner side of
the pylon at Karnak has been copied by Cham
pollion and Lepsius. That on the southern wall has
been published by Brugsch Pasha {Geographiscke
Inschriften, ii., and History of Egypt, English transla
tion, 2nd edition, p. 67), but so inaccurately that the
names in it are not to be recognised. The names,
for instance, transcribed by him in his History of
Egypt under the Pharaohs, Qa-sa-na-Htha and Pa-rihi
ought to be Q-a-n-sa-1-m-a and Q-a-r-h-u. The
hieroglyphics, however, are much defaced, and owing
to the heaping up of a bank of earth below them it
is now easier to decipher them than was formerly
the case. I have had Mr. Wilbour's assistance in making them out.



LISTS OF PLACES IN NORTHERN SYRIA, ETC. 21
The Luxor list of Ramses II. was copied by my
self in the winter of 1890-91, and I compared my
copies with the originals last winter.
According to Dr. Mahler's astronomical calcula
tions the reign of Ramses II. lasted from B.C. 1347
to 1 28 1. The date of Ramses III. falls about
seventy years later. The principal campaign of
Ramses II. against Canaan seems to have taken
place in his 8 th year ; it was then, according to
the texts of the Ramesseum, that he conquered
Shalam or Jerusalem, Marom or Merom, the Spring
of Anamini, Beth-Anoth (Josh. xv. 59) and Qarbu[tu],
" Dapur in the land of the Amorites," Ashkelon,
Gaba . ., Ata . ., Qamna, Damascus, Ai, L(u)za,
and Innuamu. The Karnak list of places in Pales
tine may, however, belong to another campaign.
The list of Luxor bears testimony to a campaign
in the north in which Ramses II. claims to have
defeated the forces not only of Carchemish and
Mitanni, but also of Assyria. The inscription which
accompanies the list refers to " a city," which " the
valiant power of the Pharaoh captured in the land of
Satuna." Where this land was situated is unknown.
On the inner wall of the pylon at Karnak the
list of countries named by the Pharaoh is prefaced
by the statement that he had overthrown " the Anti
of Menti " and the " Fenkhu." Who the latter were
is pointed out by Brugsch Pasha in his Aegyptologie,
ii. p. 466. One of the copies of the Palestine list of
Thothmes III. is accompanied by a text which



RECORDS OF THE PAST
refers to the " unknown peoples " included in it
under the general name of Fenkhu. It is therefore
possible that those scholars have been right who
have derived the Greek name of the Phoenicians
from this old Egyptian term.
The names in the list of Ramses III. which I
have copied at Medinet Habu are important to the
historian, partly because they show that the Egyptian
king marched at least as far as Hamath, though he
avoided the Phcenician cities in his passage along
the sea coast ; partly because they make it clear
that he overran Southern Palestine. Among other
towns of which he claims the capture is Hebron and
its "Spring." Like Ramses II., he also claims the
capture of " the district of Jerusalem." But his list
contains no reference to the name either of Judah or
of any other Israelitish tribe, and it would there
fore appear that even as late as the reign of Ramses
III. the Israelites were not as yet firmly established
in the future territory of Judah.
The question may be raised whether the list of
Ramses III. is not copied from that of Ramses II.,
and if so, whether the conquests claimed by him were
really his own. But a comparison of the two lists
will set all doubts on the question at rest. The list
of Ramses III. is fuller than that of his predecessor,
and follows a more accurate geographical sequence.
On the whole, moreover, the names are more cor
rectly written in it than they are in the lists of
Ramses II. Thus qau is written simply qa in the list

of the earlier king, while the Egyptian name of the
Dead Sea, " the Lake of Rethpana," appears as
" Repana." If there has been borrowing, it must have
been in both cases from a common source, of which
no trace exists.
The system of transliteration is that which has
been adopted by Mr. Tomkins. The vowels are
represented only where they occur in the hierogly
phic original, though in the case of certain characters,
like the flying bird, the seated bird, and the gate, the
vowel a has been added within brackets to their
initial consonant—-/(«), z{a), s(a). The outstretched
arm is denoted by a, the symbol for " great " by da.
It must be remembered that r and / in ancient
Egyptian are expressed by the same characters
;
in order to distinguish, however, the lion from the
mouth the first is represented by /, the second by
r. The determinative of " country " is denoted by
the double obelus (j), and the single upright line,
which signifies " one " in the hieroglyphics, as well
as the sign of the plural, is represented by a dash
(—). Lost characters are denoted by brackets [ ].



LIST OF COUNTRIES CONQUERED BY RAMSES II. ENUMERATED ON THE INNER WALL OF THE PYLON AT KARNAK
1. ArmaJ. Identified by Mr. Tomlcins with Orma, south - west of Abyssinia {Recueil de Travaux relatifs h la Philologie et a l'Archeologie egyptiennes et assyriennes, x. i, 2). Prof. Maspero reads Ilimmi {Recueil, viii. i, 2). 2. Br-br-ta, followed by the ideograph " twice." Barbarta occurs in the list of southern countries conquered by Thothmes III. (No. 9), and has been compared with the name of the modern Berber. This Brbrta, however, may be the North Syrian Barbartu of Ramses III. (B. left, ii. 8). 3. MauJ, with the determinative of walking. In the Medinet Habu list (No. B. right, i. 26) it follows the name of Korkha in Moab. It is doubtful whether it represents the native name of a country or is the Egyptian man, "road.'"^ 4. Aar-muJ. Aram. Probably the Aram or Syria of Damascus.
5. Aar[—] J. The name of El precedes that of Aram
at Medinet Habu. Compare the name of " the country of Aar " or " El " mentioned next to Nii and shortly after Tunip in the North Syrian list of Thothmes III., No. 1 34. In the stele of Panammu, king of Samalla, the kingdom of Yari is referred to more than once.^ 6. KsH. The land of Cush or Ethiopia. 7. To-Ris. " The land of the South."
1 It must, of course, be distinguished from the Mauft of the southern list of Thothmes III. (No. 4). 2 Aar is also the name of a countiy in the southern list of Thothmes III. (No. 179).



THE LIST OF PLACES IN PALESTINE CONQUERED BY RAMSES II. ENUMERATED ON THE SOUTHERN WALL OF KARNAK
FIRST LIST
1. Qans(a)-alma I, Qa-n-Salem, "the district of Salem." The position of the place in the list of Ramses III. shows that Salem or Jerusalem is meant. Shalam is one of the cities of Palestine captured by Ramses II., according to the texts of the Ramesseum. In the corresponding list of Ramses III. qa is written qan. Brugsch, in his Dictionary, gives qai as signifying " a plateau," from qa, " to be high." In the poem of Pentaur the word is written gaicit), with the determinatives of locality and road, and is in parallelism with materimt, "roads." 2. Qal-p(a)a[na]. The list of Ramses III. shows that we must read " the Lake of Re[th]pa[na]," the dental having been omitted by the Egyptian scribe. As the name of the lake comes in that list between Salem and the Jordan it must represent the Dead Sea. The dental should properly correspond with a Hebrew (Canaanitish) samech ; in thupar " a trumpet," however, it represents a shin (Hebrew shofhar), so that Rethpana may be a derivative from Resheph, the Canaanitish Sun-god, who revealed himself in flames of fire.'- Compare Gen. xix. 24.
^ The name of the god, when introduced into the Egyptian pantheon, was pronounced Reshpu. His consort seems to have been the goddess Kadesh.



26 JiECOI^DS OF THE PAST
3. Aa[rd]an[a] J. Read Yerdana, " the country of the Jordan." The name is restored from the list of Ramses III. 4. Khir-z J. Khilz, probably the Babylonian Khalzu, " fortress." 5. Qar-hu \. The Korkha of the Moabite Stone. See Records of the Past, New Series, vol. ii. p. 200. 6. [Ur]6 J. In the list of Ramses III. the determinative of locality is attached to the u in both syllables to indicate its length. Perhaps the Babylonian -Ar-Ci, the Moabite Ar or "City" (Numb. xxi. 28), is meant.
7. Abl— \. The Abel or " meadow " of a place called Karzak in the list of Ramses III. Compare the Abel of the Palestine list of Thothmes III. (No. 92). 8. QarmanaJ. Carmel of Judah. See Records of the
Past, New Series, vol. v. p. 50 (No. 96). 9. Qahir-ir-tabala t. "The upper district of Thabara." This must be Debir, the old name of Kirjath-sepher, since the dental is that which corresponds with the d of Megiddo and Damascus in the list of Thothmes
III. See the list of Ramses III., B. right, i. 16. 10. Shmashna|. Pronounce Shimshana, Shimshon, "the city of the Sun-god," called Ir-shemesh in the Old Testament (Josh. xix. 41). 11. HAnAs[T]A J, with determinative after initial /;«. This name must be taken along with the next, 12. AarizJ, the Hebrew erez, "country," the Egyptian scribe having transposed the places of the substantive and adjective. The term means "new lands." It is the Hadashah of Josh. xv. 37. See the list of Ramses III., B. right, i. 18, 19.
SECOND LIST
[R]aushqad[shu I]. Rosh-Qadesh, "the headland" of Mount Carmel. See Records of the Past, New Series, vol. v. p. 47 (No. 48).



LISTS OF PLACES IN NORTHERN SYRIA, ETC. 2^
2. I[n-]zata X. This follows the name of Rosh-Qadesh in the list of Ramses III. (B. right, ii. 12).
3. [MagJar—|. Called " the spring of the Magar " by
Ramses III. (B. right, ii. 13). It is the Magoras or river of Beyrout, which took its name from the Magharat or " Caves," past which it runs. In the Travels of a Mohar, the sky is described as being darkened there. 4. R-h(u)zaj:, with determinative after }i{ii). The name is written in the same way in the list of Ramses III. (B. right, ii. 8). It cannot have been far from Gaza. 5. S(a)-aab(a)-ta J. Written Saaba by Ramses III. (B. right, ii. 9), who places it next to Gaza. 6. Kaz(a)t(o)J. Gaza. 7. Qas(a)-r-aa \. Qa-Sala, aa being followed by the determinative. In the list of Ramses III. (B. right, ii. 5), the name is written Qau-Salakh, an attempt being made to represent the guttural sound of the Canaanitish ghaifi. "The district of Sela " must be that about Petra (2 Kings xvii. 7 ; Isaiah xvi. i).
8. Qauz(a)-asr— (?) \. The lost character is doubtful, and
may be a instead of ;. In the corresponding name, however, in the list of Ramses III. (B. right, ii. 6), we have almost certainly r. " The district of Zasr" or "Zasl," between Sela and Jacob-el.
g. Iaaqb(a)al—. The hieroglyphs neb-k, " thy lord," have beeii engraved over the name, in which aa is followed by the determinative. The "Jacob-el" of the list of Thothmes III. {Records of the Past, New Series, vol. v. ^'102). In the list of Ramses III. |o'^ (B. right, ii. 7) the name of Gaza follows after two other names. [0. P(a)t(o)nak-rith J. "The country of Akrith." This must be the Ugarit of the Tel el-Amarna tablets.

LETTERS FROM PHCENICIA TO THE KING OF EGYPT IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY B.C.
Translated by the Editor
The age and character of the cuneiform tablets
found at Tel el-Amarna in Upper Egypt have been
fully described in former volumes of this series of
the Records of the Past, as well as the principal
results derived from their discovery. During the
past winter all doubts as to the exact spot in
which they were found have been removed by
Dr. Flinders Petrie's excavations. These have
shown that the cuneiform correspondence of the Pharaohs Amendphis III. and Amendphis IV. was
stored, not in the royal palace itself, but in a
building which adjoined it, and in which probably
the scribe lived who was versed in the language and
syllabary of Babylonia. Among the objects dis
interred by Dr. Petrie is a clay cylinder, round
which runs the inscription eleven times repeated,
"The seal of Tetunu, the servant of Samas-akh
iddin." Dr. Petrie's discoveries show that the
fellahin led me to the right place when, a year



LETTERS FROM PHCENICIA 47
after the tablets had been found, they took me to
a ruined building within the precincts of the palace,
the bricks of which were stamped with the name and titles of Amenophis IV. Khu-n-Aten.
The letters of which I here give translations for
the first time have been published in the second
part of the Mittheilungen aus den orientalischen Sammlungen (Berlin, 1890) by Drs. Winckler and
Abel, and consist of the correspondence sent to
Khu-n-Aten from Phoenicia. The letters are
peculiarly difficult to decipher on account of the
non-Assyrian forms and idioms which they contain,
and which are probably of Canaanitish origin. As
Dr. Zimmern has pointed out, we find, for instance,
the first person singular of the perfect tense formed
by the suffix -ti as in Hebrew, instead of by the
suffix -ku as in the corresponding person of the
Assyrian permansive. Here and there, moreover,
a Canaanitish word is given by the side of its
Assyrian equivalent. These words afford a fresh
proof that Hebrew was originally " the language of
Canaan." Though the Phoenician letters have not the same
Biblical interest as the letters from Southern
Palestine of which I have given translations in the
last volume of the Records, we may nevertheless
gather from them several historical facts. They
show that at the time when the correspondence came to an end, the Egyptian empire in Asia was
breaking up. The enemies of "the heretic king"



48 RECORDS OF THE PAST
were beginning to threaten him in Egypt, and he
was unable to reply to the pressing requests of
his Syrian governors by sending to them the
troops for which they asked. The province they
administered was surrounded on all sides by its
foes. Ebed-Asherah, who seems to have been a
Beduin chief, together with his sons, had allied
himself to the Hittites, the Babylonians, and the
people of Aram - Naharaim, was overrunning the
land of the Amorites, and was capturing the
PhcEnician cities which lay to the west of it.
Many of the kings who had been allowed, as
at Sidon, Arka, and Hazor, to exercise their
royal functions by the side of the Egyptian
governors, revolted from Egypt, and Arvad sent its
ships to join the enemy. Rib-Addu, the Egyptian
governor of Gebal, was already old, and one of his
letters seems to show that he was preparing to
evacuate Zemar, the centre of the Egyptian govern
ment in the inland part of Phoenicia, and retire from
the northern portion of the province. It was
probably not long before the rule of Egypt ceased
to be obeyed, not only in the mountainous interior,
but also in the cities of the coast.
Among other interesting facts contained in the
letters is the mention of a Yivana or " Ionian," who
was in the country of Tyre, apparently employed in
the service of the Egyptian king. The name was,
therefore, already known in the fifteenth century
before our era, and justifies the belief of the Egypto



LETTERS FROM PHCENICIA 49
legists that in Huinivu, or Uinin as it is written in
Demotic, which represents the name of the Greeks
in the bilingual inscription of the Rosetta Stone, we
must recognise the Egyptian form of the' word
" Ionian." The name of Huinivu goes back to early
times, since in one of the pyramid texts of the Sixth
Dynasty, the Mediterranean is called " the circle
which surrounds the Huinivu." ^ The name of Rib-Addi, or Rib-Addu, is not very
easy to explain. The second element in it is the
name of the god Hadad, but it is not clear to what
root the first part of the compound should be
assigned. Probably, however, the root is rib, "to
contend," so that the name of the Phoenician
governor is precisely parallel to those of Jerub-baal
and Merib-Baal (i Chron. viii. 34), the signification
of the compound being " Hadad has pleaded."

1 The Assyrian \_khu\kkari being a rare word, the Canaanitish iilubi is
added to explain it. The latter is the Hebrew keMb (Jer. v. 27). Khukhari is one of the many words which were borrowed by Assyrian from Sumerian,
being a compound of the Sumerian khu, " bird," and kkar, "enclosure."
It has the same form as mu'saru, "a cylinder," which, as the native
scribes inform us, is a compound of the Sumerian mu, " name," and 'sar, "writing." ^ Aslsum].



THE INSCRIPTION OF ASSUR-B6L-KALA
Translated by S. Arthur Strong
One of the most striking and interesting of the
monuments of Assyrian art, preserved in the British
Museum, is the statue numbered 849. It is a nude
female figure, sadly mutilated, so much so, in fact,
that little more than the trunk remains : but the
subject has been treated in a style and on a scale
which at once arrest the attention of the observer
accustomed to the draped formality and minute
detail of the Assyrian craftsmen.
The back is covered by a partly defaced inscription
which is no less important historically than the figure
itself artistically, for it is the sole document bequeathed
to us by Assur-bel-Kala,^ who more than a thousand
years B.C. succeeded his father, the great Tiglath
pileser, as King of Assyria. The text is as follows :

Transliteration
1. ekal Assur-bel-Ka[la] . . . sar kis[sati] . . . 2. apil Tukulti-apil-Esarra . . . [sarru ?] dan[nu] . . .
1 It is true that the King's name occurs on another small fragment (Layard, 73), which probably once formed pait of a votive inscription ; but in this case the remains are too scanty to enable us to determine with
certainty either the character of the document or to whom it belonged.



THE INSCRIPTION OF ASSUR-BEL-KALA 77
3. apil Asur-ris-isi sar kis[sati sar As[surma 4. alamgate annate ki[rib?] . . . alani 5. u arrute ina mukhkhitsi akhie . . . 6. munikir sidhriia u sumiia A[num u ?] ilani 7. Martu mikhits tsiri imakhatsus
Translation
1. The palace of Assur-bel-Kala . . . King of the whole (world), [King of Assyria], 2. son of Tiglathpileser . . . the strong king . . . 3. son of Assur-ris-isi, King of the whole (world), King of the same Assyria :

4. These images in the midst of . . . the cities 5. and cursings with the crushing of the side . . . 6. Whosoever alters my writing and my name the god Anu and the gods of 7. Martu with the crushing of the back shall crush him.
It will be seen that the text is so mutilated that
whatever clue it may once have afforded to the
meaning and purpose of the statue, lies now beyond
recovery. The figure has naturally enough been
called an Istar, though not a vestige of her name can
be traced. If it were possible to conclude, from the
use of the plural in line 4, that our example formed
one member of a series, we might perhaps detect in
it the sole surviving trace of some forgotten exploit
or scheme of Assur-bel-Kala. For we know that
two centuries later Ramman-nirari III. tried to intro
duce the worship of Nebo into Assyria, or rather to
establish it there in a position of privilege ; and he
has left us a record of his pious purposes inscribed
on two twin statues of the god. It seems, therefore,



78 RECORDS OF THE PAST
not improbable that in a similar way Assur-bel-Kala
may have sought to found or to promote the worship
of some special patroness of his own, either in Assyria
or in the West, and that one of her effigies

unfortunately no longer recognisable—has accident
ally come down to us.
But there is one feature of the text which stands
out, as it were, in high relief from the surrounding
obscurity, and that is, the mention of the gods of
Martu, or the land of the Amorites : and though it
by no means necessarily follows from this that the
statue is that of an Amoritish goddess, and the work
of an Amoritish craftsman, still, on the other hand,
there is nothing to exclude the bare possibility of
such an assumption, either in the style of the figure
or in its history. But however this may be, there is
one result that seems certainly to follow from the
appearance in this place of the gods of Martu,
namely, that Assur-bel-Kala had not relaxed his
hold over the regions of the West, which the prowess
of his father had added to the Assyrian Empire.^
The text—originally published in the first volume
of TJie Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia, Plate
6, No. vi., but with so many errors as to render
it unintelligible — has been the subject of attempts
at translation by Oppert {ExpMition, i. 288) and
' [This fact would be emphasised by the rendering I prefer to give of the 4th line, where I divide the words differently from Mr. Strong, and
would accordingly translate : " these images in the [countries], cities and villages I set up on pedestah{^)." In this case the images would have been specially intended for erection in Syria. Alamg&U seems to be a foreign word.

INSCRIPTIONS OF SENNACHERIB
Translated by Professor Robert W. Rogers
Sennacherib, in Assyrian Sin-akhi-erba, "The
Moon-god has increased the brothers," ascended the
throne of Assyria on the 1 2th day of the month Ab,
in the year 705 B.C., succeeding to all the rights and
honours of the great kingdom which his father
Sargon had left. His reign continued, with many
wars and frequent difficulties, until his life was ended
by assassination in 681 B.C. (2 Kings xix. 37). Of
all his campaigns against Babylon, Elam, and other
places, none is so interesting to the Biblical student
as the great campaign against Phoenicia and Philistia.
This campaign is treated at considerable length and
with much vividness in 2 Kings xviii. 13-xix. 36,
and again in Isaiah xxxvi. i-xxxvii. 37. Sen
nacherib's own account of this campaign is presented
in the great Taylor prism here done into English,
and a comparison of this account with the Old
Testament story mentioned above would seem to
give the main facts about as follows, each accouut
mutually supplementing the other. The Kings of
Phoenicia and Philistia, with Hezekiah of Judah



INSCRIPTIONS OF SENNACHERIB
among them, made a coalition with the Egyptians
and Ethiopians to throw off the Assyrian yoke and
deHver themselves from tribute. Hearing of this
confederacy in some way, Sennacherib speedily gathered an army, and marched by the usual route
to Syria, suddenly appearing in the northern part of
the land. His coming was so unexpected that the
allies had not united their forces, and the skilful
Assyrian was able to attack them one by one. He
sent one body of the army toward Jerusalem, which
met with immediate success in overcoming a number
of cities of Judah, while the King himself led the
other portion of his army towards Lachish. Heze
kiah, fearing the army which was already advancing
with victorious banners, sent ambassadors to Lachish
with great gifts, and with protestations of his fealty
to Sennacherib. Sennacherib, however, sent an
army against the chief city, desiring to take posses
sion of the city—a plan which did not succeed.
Immediately afterwards tbe Assyrian army met the
southern allies under Tirhakah (2 Kings xix.'g), and
the battle, as may be read between the lines of
Sennacherib's account, was not a decisive victory.
His campaign closed suddenly and without the usual
long list of spoil—a lack which he attempts to supply
by representing that the presents sent by Hezekiah
to Lachish were sent to Nineveh.
The first of the two inscriptions here given refers
to the same campaign as that which is described at
length in the Taylor cylinder.

A PRAYER OF ASSURBANIPAL
Translated by Mr. S. Arthur Strong
The following text is inscribed on a tablet of clay
numbered 1285 in the Kouyunjik collection of the
British Museum. It is remarkable not only as an
almost perfect specimen of the later Assyrian cali
graphy, but for containing a number of rare words
and forms—a circumstance which has not made the
task of translation and explanation easier. But its
chief claim upon our interest and attention lies in the
fact that the unknown author displays a depth and
delicacy of religious emotion not often reached in
Assyrian literature, and hardly surpassed even by the
great masters of the emotional style—the Hebrew
psalmists. On the one hand it is distinguished from
the mass of anonymous compositions which we are
accustomed to call hymns and penitential psalms by
the absence of any traces of a magical character or
purpose, while on the other its passionate and uncon
ventional tone forms a striking contrast to the style
usually adopted by Assyrian kings, who even when
ascribing unto their lords glory and honour never
forget their own titles, but compose monotonous



A PRA YER OF ASSURBANIRAL 103
variations in strict official form upon the three
themes of pride, flattery, and fear.
The text consists of a series of confessions or
appeals on the part of Assurbanipal addressed not,
as we might perhaps have expected, to Istar but to
Nebo. These the god answers at intervals in words
of consolation and encouragement. Throughout the
text Assurbanipal is never called king. On the
contrary, in one of his replies Nebo reminds him of
his smallness and helplessness when an infant.
That these confessions and complaints may have
been drawn from Assurbanipal by the stress of some
political crisis is of course possible. We know of at
least one such instance in his career ; but the text
contains absolutely no positive data such as would
enable us to connect it with a definite event. The
most that can be said is that it cannot be later than
626 B.C.
A striking feature of the inscription is the number
of unusual verb-forms. They occur in almost every
line, and I suggest that they may be explained as a
rhythmical device of the composer.
The text has never been published ;
^ but a free
translation was contributed by Prof. Oppert to the
second volume of Ledrain's Histoire ctlsrael (p. 486).
This, however, unaccompanied as it is by any ex
planation of the renderings proposed, I have in most
cases been unable to comprehend much less to follow.

:
26. My mouth speaking that which is good shall cause thy prayer to be heard in the assembly of the great gods.
^ Urkittu can hardly be a name or title of Nebo, and must therefore be an independent divinity, who, so far as I can Iind, appears for the first time in this passage. The phrase in line 29, " the reed of Urkittu," is interesting when we remember that urq'itu signifies " grass."
^ My rendering of this line is only tentative. ' Cf. Psalm XXXV). 9 : " With thee is the fountain of Ufe.

THE NON-SEMITIC VERSION OF THE CREATION-STORY
Translated by Theo. G. Pinches
In addition to the versions of the creation-story
current in ancient times in Babylonia and Assyria,
translations of which have been published in this
series ^ by Prof. Sayce, another version has lately
come to light. This new text, unlike the others, is
written in two languages (Sumerian or Akkadian
and Semitic Babylonian), each line of the text being
divided to admit of the Semitic translation being
inserted between, giving the whole the appearance of
an inscription in three columns, the middle one rather
irregular and written in smaller characters. The
tablet is made of baked clay, and is small and very
beautifully written. Translations have been pub
lished by me in the New York Indepetident, the
Academy (29th Nov. 1890, pp. 508, 509), and (com
plete and accompanied by philological notes) the
Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1891, pp. 393
408. Prof. F. Hommel has also published a trans

The difference betv^^een this account of the Crea
tion and that published in vol. i. p. 122, is very
marked. It is short even to bareness, telling all it
has to say in a few? words, whereas the other version
extends over several closely-written tablets, and in
troduces at great length the fight between Merodach
and Tiamat, or Bel and the Dragon ; the creation
of the heavenly bodies, etc. etc. As Prof. Hommel
has pointed out, the principal thing in this new



RECORDS OF THE PAST
account of the Creation of the world was not merely
the formation of men and animals, but rather the
founding of the first seats of civilisation in Babylonia,
and, it may be added, the assertion of their divine
origin. And in this we may see why the story is
put as the introduction to an incantation ; for, judg
ing from the fragment of the reverse, the text seems
really to have referred to the dedication-festival or
purification of the well-known temple E-zida (now
the Birs-Nimroud), and the creation-story with which
it begins probably led up to the story of the founda
tion of that renowned temple.
In this new account of the Creation the small
number of the deities who took part in the work is
noteworthy. The first god mentioned is Lugal-du
azaga, " the king of the glorious abode," who is
spoken of as having founded " Eridu within the
Abyss," the paradise of the gods. Lugal-du-azaga
was probably one of the forms of ]&a, the god of the
sea and of wisdom. Merodach, the chief god of the
Babylonian pantheon, appears as a matter of course,
and is_spoken of as having created mankind, animals,
plants, and the renowned sites wherein Babylonian
civilisation had its origin. In the creation of man
kind Merodach seems to have been aided by a god
dess named Aruru, who was worshipped at Sippara
and at Aruru, twin cities of the province of Agadd
or Akkad. Aruru is probably the same as I star,
who was worshipped at Sippara, and is possibly
identical with a goddess named Gala-Aruru, " the



NON-SEMITIC VERSION OF CREATION-STORY 113
great one (of) Aruru " or " Great Aruru," who is
explained as " Istar the star," in the list of gods numbered K. 2109.
Among the parallels with the Biblical account
may be quoted lines 25-29 of the obverse, where the
creation of plants, lands, meadows, and forests is
spoken of (cf Gen. i. 11, 12); and lines 22 and
28-30, which describe the creation of living things
(cf Gen. i. 24). " He made mankind " (line 20)
corresponds with the words " And God created man "
in Gen. i. 26, 27.
On the other hand, there are some remarkable
differences. There is no true description of chaos,
the making of day and night is not mentioned, nor
the setting of the heavenly bodies to give light (this
may, however, have been given on a lost portion)
and to indicate the seasons. The text is also silent
concerning fishes, sea-monsters, and birds ; and the
days of the creation are also absent, as in the version
translated in vol. i. It is nevertheless not impossible
that we may have, in the divine Eridu, a reflection of
the garden of Eden, though there is no mention of the
placing of man therein, nor the tree of life, nor the
tree of knowledge.-' The Tigris and the Euphrates
1 Prof. Hommel has pointed out, however, that the ideograph which denotes Eridu seems to be a representation of a tree, and it is worthy of note that the divine Eridu, that within the Abyss, seems to be spolsen of as a tree or vine in W. A. I. iv. 15, rev., 11. 52, 53, where it says that "Eridu is the dark vine, growing in a glorious place" (such is a literal translation of the Akkadian text ; the Assyrian has :
'
' Eridu grew (as) a dark vine, it was made to grow in a glorious place," the translator having taken e, a kind of demonstrative suffix, or lengthening, for t', "to grow"). This tree is described as being in the likeness of bright crystal or marble,
and planted in the Abyss, and the path of 6a or Ag (god of the sea, rivers,

114 RECORDS OF THE PAST
are mentioned—not in connection with the watering
of the garden of Eden, but simply as a record of the
creation, by Merodach, of these two great waterways
which were the life of the Mesopotamian plain.
The story, as it has come down to us, ends with
the description of the building of those cities which,
at the beginning, are said not to have existed, and
gives the honour of their origination to Merodach,
the principal god worshipped by the Babylonians.
and of deep wisdom) is said to have filled Eridu with fertility. Eridu, situated within the Abyss, the abode of the god of wisdom, may therefore be regarded as a type of the tree of knowledge mentioned in Gen. ii. 9.



THE CUNEIFORM TABLETS OF KAPPADOKIA
Translated by the Editor
We now have evidence that the cuneiform system of
writing was once employed throughout the greater
part of the civilised world of the East. The Persians
under Darius formed an alphabet out of it, which
became the key to the modern decipherment of the
cuneiform texts. It had originally been the inven
tion of the primitive Sumerian population of Chaldaea,
who spoke an agglutinative language, and from
whom it was borrowed by the Semitic Babylonians
and Assyrians. In Elam it was used to express the
agglutinative dialects of Shushan and Mai-Amir, and
in the ninth century before our era it was adopted
by the kings of Ararat, who reigned at Van, and
whose language seems to have been related to that
of the Georgians of to-day. A seal found near
Herat in 1842 shows that even as far east as Bak
tria the cuneiform characters were employed to
represent the language of the country, and the in
scription of Anu-banini, King of Lulubi, discovered
by Sir Henry Rawlinson at Ser-i-pul and lately
copied by Mr. de Morgan, tells us that here also the



ii6 RECORDS OF THE PAST
ancient language of the inhabitants had been em
bodied in the characters of the cuneiform script.
We have learnt from the tablets of Tel el-Amarna
that in the century before the Exodus the same
system of writing was the common medium of
literary intercourse among the various nations who
lived between the Tigris and the frontiers of Egypt.
Among the correspondence found at Tel el-Amarna
is a long letter in the language of Mitanni, the
Aram-Naharaim of Scripture, the characters in which
it is written being those of the cuneiform syllabary,
and the extent to which the syllabary was studied
and known in Canaan at the time removes our
astonishment at finding that it has been used to
express the Phcenician language on two seals now
in the collection of M. de Clercq.
The cuneiform system of writing and the Assy
rian language had penetrated even to the north-west,
to the neighbourhood of the modern Kaisariyeh. The
discovery of the cuneiform inscriptions of Kappa
dokia is due to the sagacity of Mr. Pinches. In
1882 he pointed out the existence of two tablets,
one in the British Museum, the other in the Louvre,
which were written in a peculiar form of cuneiform
script and apparently in an unknown language.
They had been obtained from an Armenian dealer
in antiquities at Constantinople, and the occurrence
of the word ku-din-a, " mules," in the one in the
British Museum made Mr. Pinches connect it with a tablet from Nineveh in which mention was made of



THE CUNEIFORM TABLETS OF KAPPADOKIA 117
the transport of these animals from Kusa in Kappa
dokia {Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archceology,
Nov. 1 881). The following summer Prof. W. M.
Ramsay bought five more tablets of a similar
character at Kaisariyeh, upon which I published an
article in the Proceedings of the Society of Biblical
Archcsology (Nov. 1883). As, however, I was unable
to identify correctly a large number of the characters,
I was also unable to decipher the texts, and the
conclusions I drew in regard to the language of them
were incorrect.
The tablets obtained by Prof. Ramsay are now in
the British Museum. Other tablets have since been
purchased by Mr. Golenischeff, the University of
Philadelphia, and myself, and it is now known that
they are found in a place three or four hours distant
from Kaisariyeh.
Mr. Gol6nischeff's collection is a large one, and a
comparison of his tablets one with another has opened
up the way to their decipherment. Thus he has
discovered that the character wrongly identified by
Mr. Pinches and myself with the ideograph of
" woman " is really the ideograph which means " in
the presence of," and that consequently the words
which follow it must be the names of witnesses to a
deed. He generously placed both his tablets and
his discoveries at my disposal three years ago, and
I was accordingly able to announce to the Oriental
Congress at Stockholm that I could translate some
of the tablets, and was further in a position to deter



ii8 RECORDS OF THE PAST
mine the age to which they belong and the nature
of the dialect in which they are written {Academy,
Sept. 7, 1889, p. 157). Last winter Mr. Gol6ni
scheff published copies of twenty-four tablets belong
ing to his collection, together with a full and interest
ing introduction to them, and a list of the characters
found in them, under the title: " Vingt-quatre
Tablettes cappadociennes de la Collection W. Gol^ni
scheff" (St. Petersburg, 1891). In this work he
has determined the values of most of the characters,
and pointed out the signification of many words.
The tablets are written in an Assyrian dialect.
On the phonetic side the dialect displays the pecu
liarities of the Tel el-Amarna letters from Northern
Syria, changing t into d, k into g, p into b. Like
them it also employs the old Babylonian mivi
mation, and substitutes b for is. But in certain
respects its phonology is peculiair, yutz'r, for instance,
appearing as yutair, and itur as iduar. The voca
bulary is mainly Assyrian, but it contains some
Aramaic forms, like the proper name Garia, " the
stranger," and the plural in -A (which, however,
occurs in only two of the tablets known to me), as
well as words which we have hitherto regarded as
specifically Hebrew. Among these is aparne, " a
chariot " or " litter," which throws light on the appirydn
of Canticles iii. 9 — the only passage in Semitic
literature where it has been otherwise found—and
proves that the word is not of Greek origin, as has
sometimes been asserted ; ati, " substance " or " pro-^



THE CUNEIFORM TABLETS OF KAPPADOKIA 119
perty " ; adunu, " lord " ; and urubatum, " a pledge,"
the Hebrew 'erdbhon. But besides these Semitic
words, the dialect further presents us with a con
siderable number of words which have no Semitic
etymology, and must therefore have been borrowed
from the language of the country from which the
tablets come. That the speakers of the dialect were
mixed with a foreign population is clear from the
evidence of the tablets themselves, as the epithet
garuin, or " stranger," is often attached in them to a
name which is usually non-Semitic in character.
Thus we read at the beginning of one tablet (G. No.
19): "The mother of the stranger Ganis to the
stranger Burus, Khati-zadinniat, says." A duplicate
of a contract is also sometimes mentioned as being
" written according to the language of the foreigner."
It would seem, accordingly, that the tablets
belong to an Assyrian colony which was established
in a city of Kappadokia in the midst of a foreign
population. Here the usages and customs of Assyria
were maintained, such as the use of the Assyrian
language and syllabary, the yearly appointment of
officers called limmi, or " eponyms," after whom time was reckoned, and the employment of proper names,
of which the name of Assur formed an element. It
was inevitable, however, that the colonists should in
course of time become affected by the foreign influ
ences around them, and hence it was that the purity
of their pronunciation was lost, and that their language
became filled with foreign words. We know from



liECORDS OF THE PAST
the Assyrian inscriptions that colonies had been
planted in the countries north of Assyria by the
Assyrian kings at an early period. Thus Assur
natsir-pal informs us that Shalmaneser I., about
1300 B.C., had settled "Assyrian colonists" near the
sources of the Tigris/ and that other Assyrian
colonists were established in the city of Tuskhan not
far from Mount Masius.^
The age of the Kappadokian tablets is, I believe,
as early as that of the Tel el-Amarna tablets. We
find in both the same archaic formulae, and the same
use of an ideograph by the side of the phonetically
written word which it denotes. As I have already
stated, the dialect of the tablets is distinguished by
the phonetic peculiarities which belong to the letters
from Northern Syria in the Tel el-Amarna collection,
and the forms of the characters are similar in the two
classes of documents. The employment of the mim
mation also points to an early date. That Assyria
was already in close relations with Khani-rabbat or
Melitene in the fifteenth century B.C. we have learnt
from the Tel el-Amarna correspondence,^ and the
place where the tablets are found may easily have
been included within the kingdom of Khani-rabbat.
It may be added that one of the tablets belonging
to Mr. Gol^nischeff bears the impress of a seal, upon
which are figures in the Hittite style of art as well
as the remains of a Hittite character.
^ Records of the Past, New Series, vol. ii. p. 145. ^ Ibid, vol. ii. p. 147. Sec also p. 160, note i. " Ibid. vol. iii. p. 62.



THE CUNEIFORM TABLETS OF KAPPADOKIA 121
The tablets relate for the most part to the loan of
money, or the deposit of various objects in the hands
of certain persons, and they contain a number of
technical terms, the meaning of which is not as yet
clear. One of these terms is khamustu, " a fifth," of
which we also find the plural khamsatu, " fifths." A
" fifth " was generally deducted from the sum of
money lent out at interest, though who was the
official to whom it was paid, and why it was paid,
are questions to which at present I can return no
answer. Besides the limviu, or yearly eponym, whose
title is always written limuni, we find mention of the
durdanu, in Assyrian turtanu, or " Tartan " (G. xx.
2i) ; of a Rab-zikitum, or Chief Judge ; of a Rab
gimelti, or Chief Magistrate ; of a Rab-aladinnim
;
and of a Rubaum, or " prince."
Most of the deities mentioned in the tablets are
Assyrian. Thus we find the names of Assur, Anu,
Istar, Bel, Nebo, Nana or Nani, Samas, and Zu.
Zu, indeed, who occupies only a subordinate place
in the Assyrian pantheon, seems to have been a
favourite in Kappadokia, if we may judge from the
number of proper names into which his name enters.
Thus we have Ena-Zuim, " the eye of Zu," and Zu
galia, " Zu is my priest." Another deity was Babu,
" the gate," who appears to have been of Aramaic
origin. At all events the name is not found in the
lists of the Assyrian divinities, while, according to
Damascius,! j^e goddess Babia was worshipped at
^ Uita Isidori, 76.



RECORDS OF THE PAST
Damascus. The Aramaic name Bur-Addi, corre
sponding to the Hebrew Ben-Hadad, occurs in one
of the tablets (G. ix. 1 1), and we meet also with that
of Bar-'Sibala (G. xviii. 2). Among the Semitic
deities mentioned in the tablets, but not worshipped
in Assyria, is Basku, " the serpent." Besides the
Semitic deities there are, as might be expected,
others of foreign origin. One of these is Tarku,
whom I had long since maintained to be a Hittite
god ; a second is Khati, " the Hittite " (?), whose
name enters into that of a woman called Khati
zadinniat.
The introduction of Assyrian deities into Kappa
dokia explains the proper names met with in the
Greek inscriptions of Kappadokia and Kilikia, which
are obviously derived from the names of Assyrian
gods. Thus we have Nanas from Nana, Nineis
from Nin, Nenaris from Nannaru. As Nineps is
one of the Kilikian names which have thus been
handed down to us, it seems probable that the name
of the Assyrian god Uras, which is often represented
by the two characters Nin and ip, was really pro
nounced Nin-ip.
In place of the name of a particular deity we
very often have merely the word il or el, " god." In
fact, the simple zV or e/ seems to recur more fre
quently than even the name of Assur. We find,
for instance, Iqib-il (perhaps " Jacob is god ") by
the side of Iqib-Istar and Egib-mekhra, Ilu-rabu
("God is great"), Ilu-nada ("God has appointed").



THE CUNEIFORM TABLETS OF KAPPADOKIA 123
Asuma-il,i Erada-il, Anakh-ili, Sulaba-il, Nur-ki-ili,
and El-Anima (perhaps " a god is Anu," like Nani
belim, " Nana is lord "). This preference /or the
simple il—which is also written el—may be due to
its substitution for the name of some foreign divinity,
but it may also indicate the existence among the
colonists of a tendency towards monotheism.
The names of several months are mentioned in
the tablets. One is Kuzallu (G. iii. 12), which,
according to a lexical tablet {W. A. I. v. 43, 14),
was a name of the month Sivan. As the great
cylinder inscription of Tiglath-pileser I. is dated in
this month, its name may be regarded as a witness
in favour of the early date of the Kappadokian
tablet. Another month is Kur-sarani or Akh
saranim (G. iv. 7 ; x. 8), while a third is arkhu-sa
zarati, "the month of sowing'' (G. vi. 12, 13), and
a fourth is lyyar-Qamarta (G. ix. 9). Here the
word Qamarta seems to be the native name of the
Assyrian lyyar or April, the whole name signifying
" the month of the bull Qamarta." A fifth month
was that of Napisti-Zuim, the month of " the life of
the god Zu " (G. xi. 9).
In the references the letter G. denotes the in
scriptions published by Mr. Gol6nischeff. As the
texts are here translated for the first time, while many
of the characters have not been previously identified,
I have given my readings pretty freely in the notes.
' The word Asuma seems to mean '
' share " in an inheritance. See note 6 on No. iv. below. But as it would also correspond to the name of the
Hamathite god Ashima (2 Kings xvii. 30), Asuma-i! may signify "Asuma is god."
