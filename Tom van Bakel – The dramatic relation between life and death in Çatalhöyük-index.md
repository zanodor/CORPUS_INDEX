# Index for Tom van Bakel – The dramatic relation between life and death in Çatalhöyük.pdf

The dramatic relation between life and death in Çatalhöyük
It is obvious that the dead played an important role in everyday life in Çatalhöyük, (a Neolithic and Chalcolithic settlement in southern Anatolia, existing from about 7100 BC to 5700 BC). Life was by no means easy: there was a lot of infant mortality and many women died in childbirth. As a result, death occupied an crucial place in the artworks and through these artworks I tried to find out how people in Çatalhöyük dealt with life and death. I also did this on the basis of Sumerian texts, although they were written much later and far away from Çatalhöyük: I am sorry, but I simply could not do otherwise.
Number 1
!
I start with this ceramic statue made by an anonymous artist about 8000 years ago. It is very impressive although it is less than 20 cm high. In the middle sits an overwhelming mother goddess who is giving birth to a child. However, she is sandwiched between two felines, feared predators who live to kill.
This image thus shows the contrast between 'giving life' and 'taking it away', and I got the idea that this contrast was dominant in the Çatalhöyük culture.



Number 2
We find it, for example, in this reproduction of a hunted stag painted on a wall of one of the houses. This enormous animal will be killed and eaten, which makes it possible that the pregnant female on the right will give birth to her baby (I am sorry again, but in this reproduction it is hard to see that this female indeed is pregnant). So here we can see that butchering a stag brings forth new human life.
Number 3
This reproduction of a dramatic scene painted on wall of another house shows the reverse: two vultures are busy eating a decapitated human. The two birds are pregnant, and thus this painting demonstrates that death of a human brings forth new vulture life.



Number 4
It is very striking that when a victim was killed in antiquity nothing of him got lost: there was no total destruction. For example, in the myth ‘Gilgameš and Ḫuwawa’ it reads that all auras of the slain Huwawa get a new destination. Gilgamesh beheaded this monster and sacrificed the head to Enlil. Then the storm god gave away the auras of this dreaded creature: to the fields, the rivers, the reed beds, the lions, etc.
Gilgameš and Ḫuwawa
Ḫuwawa addressed Enkidu: ‘Enkidu, you speak such hateful words against me to him! You hireling, who are hired for your keep! You who follow along after him -- you speak such hateful words to him.’ 2 lines fragmentary} As Ḫuwawa spoke thus to him, Enkidu, full of rage and anger, cut his throat. They put his head in a leather bag. They entered before Enlil. After they had kissed the ground before Enlil, they threw the leather bag down, tipped out his head, and placed it before Enlil. When Enlil saw the head of Ḫuwawa, he spoke angrily to Gilgameš. ‘Why did you act in this way? Was it commanded that his name should be wiped from the earth? He should have sat before you! He should have eaten the bread that you eat, and should have drunk the water that you drink! He should have been honoured ...... you!’ From his seat, Enlil assigned Ḫuwawa's heavenly auras to ...... He gave Ḫuwawa's first aura to the fields. He gave his second aura to the rivers. He gave his third aura to the reedbeds. He gave his fourth aura to the lions. He gave his fifth aura to the {palace} {(1 ms. has instead:) debt slaves}. He gave his sixth aura to the {forests} {(1 ms. has instead:) the hills}. He gave his seventh aura to Nungal (the goddess of prisoners) .
We might ask: isn't it likely that the human figures in the paintings were beheaded because they were opponents, criminals or victims? Their headless corpses may have been sacrificed to the vultures and the next question is: 'What happens then, what significance do these birds have in the Çatalhöyük culture?'.



Number 5
We know, for example, that in Egypt the vulture represented the protective goddess Nekhbet:
Nekhbet (/ˈnɛkˌbɛt/; also spelt Nekhebit) was an early predynastic local goddess in Egyptian mythology, who was the patron of the city of Nekheb (her name meaning of Nekheb). Ultimately, she became the patron of Upper Egypt and one of the two patron deities for all of Ancient Egypt when it was unified.
Nekhbet usually was depicted hovering, with her wings spread above the royal image, clutching a shen symbol (representing eternal encircling protection), frequently in her claws.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nekhbet
But the vulture hieroglyph has a different meaning: in some late texts of the Book of the Dead, Nekhbet is referred to as Father of Fathers, Mother of Mothers, who hath existed from the Beginning, and is Creatrix of this World':
‘The vulture hieroglyph was the unilateral sign used for the glottal sound including words such as mother, prosperous, grandmother, and ruler. In some late texts of the Book of the Dead, Nekhbet is referred to as Father of Fathers, Mother of Mothers, who hath existed from the Beginning, and
is Creatrix of this World.’ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nekhbet



Number 6
Here two vultures are busy eating decapitated humans. Two cavities are recessed into the bodies of both of them.
In the left vulture are these two cavities.
o The right one may represent a stomach filled with the victim's flesh. o The left one may represent a womb because it has a hand painted in it.
This hand may symbolize the concept of 'modelling’ or ‘creating'.
We can see the cognate for the root in Sumerian kid/t2 (for *kit2) , 'pinch off, separate', written with
Jaritz #104, , which depicts a 'left hand in a gesture of rejection' of the offal after fleshing. This is the term used to describe the action of Enki, the creator-god, in removing (scraping off) clay with which to make the first man and woman.
http://reocities.com/proto-language/ProtoLanguage-Monosyllables.htm.
So, the vulture eats the headless human filling her own stomach, but from this dead body new life is also modelled in her womb. This painting therefore shows that new life comes from death.



Number 7
So, Nekhbet is also referred to as Father of Fathers, Mother of Mothers. In this imprint, the two vultures have a similar role: they carry an earthenware pot in their legs and these pots symbolize 'modelling'. This implies that the vultures are creative birds, they bring life (also symbolized by the ankh) to the people, like the storm god Ningublaga does:
An adab to Ningublaga for Iddin-Dagan
The lord, a furious angry storm against the enemy, ......, strong ......, my lord who brings life to the people, whose own father ......, a great storm, a mighty raring ......, has ...... -- the lord whose manliness is impressively strong, ......!
The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
Number 8
This imprint showed clearly that a mythical bird gave birth to a child:
o A double-headed mythical bird flied above a naked youth. o It had spread its legs, symbolizing that it gave birth to this youngster below.
Similar to this, the pregnant vultures, who have eaten the decapitated humans, may have bestowed their auras on the Çatalhöyük community. That could be why griffon vulture skulls are embedded in plaster walls in some houses.
Wall paintings at Çatalhöyük include representations of vultures attacking headless bodies, and
there are skulls of griffon vultures embedded in plaster walls in some of the houses. Other ancient Anatolian sites also appear to have vulture iconography. This strongly suggests some sort of symbolic relationship between the ancient culture and the vultures.

Number 9
It was absolutely self-evident that after a battle the weapons of the slain would be captured, which of course meant that the victors came out of the battle better armed. For the same reason, the skeletons of enemies, criminals and victims may have been buried under the walls and the floors of the houses. Their auras were not lost but ‘reinforced’ the community.
Number 10
Two gods kill the warlike Qingu and then Ea (in the fish suit) created mankind from his blood.
It won’t be a surprise any longer, but nothing gets lost in the Enuma Elish either:
o Ea killed his great-great-grandfather and then he built his dwelling on his corpse. o In the same myth, Marduk overcame the mother goddess Tiamat and transformed her into heaven and earth. o Finally, Quingu was punished and from his blood Ea created mankind.
Tablet VI
‘Qingu is the one who instigated warfare, Who made Tia-mat rebel and set battle in motion.’ They bound him, holding him before Ea,
They inflicted the penalty on him and severed his blood-vessels. From his blood he (Ea) created mankind,
Enuma Elish - The Babylonian Epic of Creation - by Joshua J. Mark



Number 11
This drawing shows a plastered skull unearthed in the settlement. It may have been used to fertilize the community. In the myth ‘Enki and the world order we read that Inanna sow heads like seed.
Enki and the world order ‘Inana, you heap up human heads like piles of dust, you sow heads like seed. Inana, you destroy
what should not be destroyed; you create what should not be created. You remove the cover from the šem drum of lamentations, Maiden Inana, while shutting up the tigi and adab instruments in their homes. You never grow weary with admirers looking at you. Maiden Inana, you know nothing of tying the ropes on deep wells.’
In the first place, the sentence indicates that Inanna has fully destroyed countless people. Nevertheless, when the heads were similar to seed it may have been the reason why skulls were buried under the floors: because they caused new life or reinforced fertility.



Number 12
The skeletons found in Çatalhöyük have been examined, which has revealed a startling picture:
Many skeletons of children are found under the foundations of the houses. 9% is fetus; 41% are new born; that brings their number to 50%. 14% concerns children. So 64% of the skeletons are children.
Venuskunst-eerherstel-aan-de-Moeder.pdf
According to these examinations 64% of the children die and only 46% reach adulthood. These figures are dramatic.
Number 13
When we know that there was a lot of dying in antiquity, it suddenly becomes understandable why the scenes on the cylinder seals are often so brutal.
o This imprint also contains violence: on the right we see a love scene. o At the same time, the children that resulted from this sexual intercourse are also on the imprint: they are standing on the left. o They hold a sword, meaning they will take the life of one of their parents, or perhaps of both of them. o So here the new life clearly causes the death of the old.
We read something similar in the Enuma Elish: Ea poured sleep in his great-greatgrandfather Apzu and having fettered him he slew him. (See below.)



Number 14
And here is a dramatic killing too. In this imprint the seal owner with his scimitar walks at the left watching the dramatic killing of the child at the right.
Number 15
Again, a child is killed by a lion-man this time.
Number 16
And in this drawing, six naked gods are fighting, half standing upright and the other half is turned around, probably to descend to the Netherworld.



Number 17
As we saw before the starvation figures of Çatalhöyük were dramatic and I suspected that they are 'explained' by the movements of the sun and moon. Let me try to clarify this to you:
It is believed that every month with a new moon the moon is born again:
An adab (?) to Suen for Šu-Suen (Šu-Suen F)
The beauty of heaven, the prince of earth, youthful Suen, the immense, the light of heaven and earth, who makes years of prosperity and good ...... last permanently, Nanna, the lord who is born each month, sired my Šu-Suen.
This means that every month the moon must also disappear or die.
A šir-namursaĝa to Ninsiana for Iddin-Dagan
At the New Year, on the day of the rites, in order for her to determine the fate of all the countries, so that during the day (?) the faithful servants can be inspected, so that on the day of the disappearance of the moon the divine powers can be perfected, a bed is set up for my lady. Esparto grass is purified with cedar perfume and arranged on that bed for my lady, and a coverlet is smoothed out on the top (?) of it.
As you see, the natural revolutions of the sun and moon were humanized in ancient times and turned into myths.



Number 18
So, with new moon, the sun and moon conjunct and move together through the celestial space, but each succeeding day the moon moves more and more away from the sun.
After thirteen days, the full moon and the sun face each other. This means that when the sun rises in the east then the full moon sets in the west. In mythical terms, the moment the sun is born in the morning the full moon dies or disappears into the nether world.
Enki and the world order
He filled the E-kur, the house of Enlil, with possessions. Enlil was delighted with Enki and Nibru was glad. He demarcated borders and fixed boundaries. For the Anuna gods, Enki situated dwellings in cities and disposed agricultural land into fields. Enki placed in charge of the whole of heaven and earth the hero, the bull who comes out of the ḫašur forest bellowing truculently, the youth Utu, the bull standing triumphantly, audaciously, majestically, the father of the Great City (an expression for the underworld), the great herald in the east of holy An, the judge who searches out verdicts for the gods, with a lapis-lazuli beard, rising from the horizon into the holy heavens -- Utu, the son born by Ningal.
I guess that the people in Çatalhöyük mirrored this and thus the movements of the sun and moon may have been a mythological ‘explanation’ for the death of more than half of the children: at new moon the sun and the moon are born together, but then the moon leaves the sun and when the sun is born after thirteen days the moon dies. In the same way: when two children are born in about the same time one of them will die too.
There is an even comprehensive relationship between life and death because from 6480 B.C. to 5700 B.C. the Gemini constellation was particularly important for the settlement of Çatalhöyük. To make this clear I just have to tell you some things about two annual events: the celebration of the new year in March and the blessing of marriages in June.



Marriages in June
Number 19
In the Ancient Near East, the new year started in March. With every new year young gods were born and these gods were conceived nine months earlier in June. The best example is from Juno herself, the goddess of June:
Juno is the patroness of marriage, and many people believe that the most favourable time to marry is June, the month named after the goddess.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(mythology)
In June, the divine couple Jupiter and Juno engendered their son Mars who was born nine months later on March 1:
Martius or mensis Martius (‘March’) was the first month of the ancient Roman year until possibly as late as 153 BC. After that time, it was the third month, following Februarius (February) and preceding Aprilis (April). Martius was one of the few Roman months named for a deity, Mars, who was regarded as an ancestor of the Roman people through his sons Romulus and Remus.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martius_(month)
March is named after this war god and at that time the new year began with his divine birth. Not only Jupiter and Juno married each other in June but in ancient Rome June was known for a large number of marriages:
In Rome ‘June is known for the large number of marriages that occur over the course of the month. According to one etymology, June is named after Juno. She was the goddess of marriage and a married couple's household, so some consider it good luck to be married in this month.’
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June



Childbirth in March
Number 20
Children engendered during these marriages in June were born about nine months later in March:
Every year, on the first of March, women held a festival in honour of Juno Lucina called the
Matronalia. Lucina was an epithet for Juno as ‘she who brings children into light’. On this day, lambs and cattle were sacrificed in her honour in the temple of her sacred grove on the Cispius.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(mythology)
It turned out that in the Ancient Near East and thus in Çatalhöyük June was also the best month to marry, which meant that many children were born in March.
In ‘The First Cities (The Emergence of Man)’ Dora Jane Hamblin writes about the above and previous pictures:
‘Fertility is depicted on this stone plaque: on the left a god and a goddess embracing each other. On the right, the goddess carries the apparent product of the embrace: a baby’.



The constellations Gemini
Number 21
Once again, Çatalhöyük lasted from ca. 7100 BC to ca. 5700 B.C. And from 6480 B.C. to 5700 B.C. the sun started passing through Gemini with new year. This constellation may have been represented by the above two leopards. In Greek mythology it was associated with the twins Castor and Pollux but in the Ancient Near East it was associated with the sun and moon.
This meant that when you were born in Gemini it was natural in an astrological sense that your life was influenced by this constellation that you mirrored the movements of the sun and moon. This meant that because the children were born in Gemini, it was ‘astrological correct’ that one of the two children would live and the other descend to the Netherworld and die.
Because the Çatalhöyük was determined by this constellation, it was obvious that there was an upper world and a lower world: together they symbolized Gemini. That could have been the astrological reason why the dead were buried in the floor in this settlement. In this way the living and the dead stayed in the same house: the house of the Twins.



Number 22
This is a reconstruction of a house in Çatalhöyük. We see people living on the floor walking around talking to each other, doing their household and tell stories to their children. And under the floor the dead are buried.
It is remarkable that the house does not have a door to the outside, but when the residents want to leave it they have to climb the ladder: they have to go upwards like the sun, while the dead go downwards like the moon: as with a full moon the sun travels through the sky during the day and at the same time the moon dwells in the nether world. So this house represents Gemini on a human scale.



Number 23
In this imprint we see a god being killed and a building being built. This may be an illustration of a scene from the Enuma Elish myth. In this myth, Apzu is killed by his great-great-grandson Ea. This water god then builds his dwelling on the corpse of his great-great-grandfather, so nothing is lost:
Enuma Elish: ‘When on High . . .’ The Mesopotamian/Babylonian Creation Myth Dennis Bratcher
A master design against it he devised and set up, Made artful his spell against it, surpassing and holy. He recited it and made it subsist in the deep, As he poured sleep upon him. Sound asleep he lay. When he had made Apsu prone, drenched with sleep, Mummu, the adviser, was powerless to stir. He loosened his band, tore off his tiara, Removed his halo and put it on himself. Having fettered Apsu, he slew him.
Mummu he bound and left behind lock. (70)
Having thus established his dwelling upon Apsu,



The constellation Virgo
Number 24
It is estimated that the statue was made about 6000 B.C. At that time, the sun went through Virgo in June and through Gemini in March.
As I said before: marriages were performed in June, when the sun went through Virgo, and if children were conceived on the wedding night, then they were born about nine months later in Gemini. Again, the celestial objects associated with Gemini are the sun and moon.
Now the image can be understood in the following way: the seated goddess represents Ishtar, the presided deity of Virgo (see the next table), and the two felines represent the sun and moon in Gemini. These two felines are, of course, feared predators, which could symbolize that births in those days were often fatal. This gives Gemini a macabre look: Ishtar delivers children in March, but one of the two babies will die during or shortly after birth.



When we look at the following table we will notice that Ishtar is the presiding deity of the Babylonian month Araḫ Ulūlu. In this month the sun passes through Virgo and in this way Ishtar is indeed connected with this constellation.

Number 25
In Çatalhöyük this goddess sculpture was buried in the ground. She may have been similar to Ereškigala, whose name meant: ‘Queen of the Great Earth’, and who lived in the Underworld.
The temple hymns
O Enegir, great libation pipe, libation pipe to the underworld of Ereškigala, Gudua (Entrance to the nether world) of Sumer where mankind is gathered, E-gida (Long house), in the land your shadow has stretched over the princes of the land. Your prince, the seed of the great lord, the sacred one of the great underworld, given birth by Ereškigala, playing loudly on the zanaru instrument, sweet as the voice of a calf, Ninazu of the words of prayer, has erected a house in your precinct, O house Enegir, and taken his seat upon your dais.
The goddess looks like Ishtar and she may be her sister like Ereškigala, the Queen of the Earth, is the sister of Inanna/Ishtar, the Lady of Heaven.
Inanna's descent to the nether world
After she had crouched down and had her clothes removed, they were carried away. Then she made her sister Ereškigala rise from her throne, and instead she sat on her throne. The Anuna, the seven judges, rendered their decision against her. They looked at her -- it was the look of death. They spoke to her -- it was the speech of anger. They shouted at her -- it was the shout of heavy guilt. The afflicted woman was turned into a corpse. And the corpse was hung on a hook.
As she looks like Ishtar she may be a mother goddess too, like Ereškigala is a mother goddess as Ninazu (Lord Healer) is her son:
The death of Ur-Namma
To Ereškigala, the mother of Ninazu ......, in her palace, the shepherd Ur-Namma offered a ...... with oil, a šaĝan bowl of perfect make, a royal ......, ...... the divine powers of the nether world ......
So, here we see another Gemini balance: while Ishtar moves through the sky this goddess dwells in the Netherworld.



Number 26
Here we see dead humans buried under the floor of a Çatalhöyük house. I suppose it was believed that these dead were necessary, because when they were there, one was in harmony with the heavenly balance between life and death, like in the myth ‘Inanna's descent to the nether world’. In this myth Inanna (The Lady of Heaven) had to find a replacement for herself: ‘If Inanna is to ascend from the underworld, let her provide a substitute for herself’.
Inana's descent to the nether world
Erec-ki-gala said to the gala-tura and the kur-jara: ‘Bring your queen ......, your ...... has been seized.’ Inana, because of Enki's instructions, was about to ascend from the underworld. But as Inana was about to ascend from the underworld, the Anuna seized her: ‘Who has ever ascended from the underworld, has ascended unscathed from the underworld? If Inana is to ascend from the underworld, let her provide a substitute for herself.’
She chose her beloved Dumuzid (which means: ‘The Loyal Son’) to replace her: he had to descend to the underworld to restore balance:
Inana's descent to the nether world
They followed her to the great apple tree in the plain of Kulaba. There was Dumuzid clothed in a magnificent garment and seated magnificently on a throne. The demons seized him there by his thighs. The seven of them poured the milk from his churns. The seven of them shook their heads like ....... They would not let the shepherd play the pipe and flute before her (?). She looked at him, it was the look of death. She spoke to him (?), it was the speech of anger. She shouted at him (?), it was the shout of heavy guilt: ‘How much longer? Take him away.’ Holy Inana gave Dumuzid the shepherd into their hands
If it was indeed believed that there was some sort of balance between the living and the dead, then one could therefore say that because the dead dwelled under the floor, the living on the floor could go on with their lives.



Mother of a living child and a dead one
Number 27
This leads us to this a unique figurine, it shows two sides of a woman: the front with the full breasts, the full belly and the big navel shows her as a pregnant mother, but the back shows her as a skeleton. This could be the mother goddess in Gemini, she could unite sun and moon, life and death in herself and she could be the mother of a living as well as a dead child.
This figure depicts a human, hybrid representation perhaps of life and death. The front portrays the typical robust female with large breasts and stomach (provocatively, the navel appears to protrude (umbilical hernia) which sometimes occurs in pregnancy); very thin arms with delineated fingers fold up to rest on the breasts. The front base of the figure is missing but it appears to be seated with legs crossed in front. Red paint is present around neck and between breasts in four concentric chains, and on the wrists and possibly the ankles. The trace of red paint in lower area suggests painted decoration seen on the ankles of other figures. The back portrays an articulated skeleton with a modelled spinal column, a pelvis and scapula’s that project above shoulders. Individual ribs and vertebrae are depicted through horizontal and diagonal scoring. A prominent dowel hole indicates that originally the piece had a separate, detachable head. A circular ‘footprint’ around the dowel hole suggests that the head fit snugly into this curved space. The figurine was plastered and shows evidence of undergoing secondary burning (darkened clay/yellowish plaster), which is especially visible on the front from arms/breasts down and diagonally down sides where plaster is missing.
Figure 83. 12401.X7. Hybrid representation perhaps of life and death. ÇATALHÖYÜK 2005 ARCHIVE REPORT Çatalhöyük Research Project



Number 28
Here we see the sun god and moon god depicted as children because they have just been born. It is clear: one goes up and the other goes down like in the myth ‘Enlil and Ninlil’.
Enlil and Ninlil
Enlil spoke to the man at the city gate: ‘City gatekeeper! Keeper of the barrier! Porter! Keeper of the holy barrier! When your lady Ninlil comes, if she asks after me, don't tell her where I am!’ Ninlil addressed the city gatekeeper: ‘City gatekeeper! Keeper of the barrier! Porter! Keeper of the holy barrier! When did your lord Enlil go by?’ She spoke to him; Enlil answered as the city gatekeeper: ‘My lord has not talked with me at all, O loveliest one. Enlil has not talked with me at all, O loveliest one.’ ‘I will make clear my aim and explain my intent. You can fill my womb once it is empty -- Enlil, lord of all the lands, has had sex with me! Just as Enlil is your lord, so am I your lady!’ ‘If you are my lady, let my hand touch your ......!’ ‘The seed of your lord, the bright seed, is in my womb. The seed of Suen, the bright seed, is in my womb.’ ‘My master's seed can go up to the heavens! Let my seed go downwards! Let my seed go downwards, instead of my master's seed!’ Enlil, as the city gatekeeper, got her to lie down in the chamber. He had intercourse with her there, he kissed her there. At this one intercourse, at this one kissing he poured the seed of Nergal-Meclamta-ea into her womb.
Number 29
Here again we see the sun god and moon god depicted as children because they were just born in Gemini. One goes up while the other descends to the Netherworld.



Number 30
As we saw before, under the houses a number of dead in a foetal position have been excavated, and the attitude suggests that the deceased is born again, most likely as a spirit, just as centuries later Nannaya also lives on as a spirit:
An elegy on the death of Nannaya
‘May the ...... of the Land ....... May he bring you favourable ...... words, may they make you content. O Nannaya, may your spirit be pleased, may your heart be at rest.’
And Enkidu saw the spirits of the dead in the nether world:
Gilgameš, Enkidu and the nether world
‘Did you see him who was reached by the curse of his mother and father?’ ‘I saw him.’ ‘How does he fare?’ ‘He is deprived of an heir. His spirit roams about.’ ‘Did you see him who ...... the name of his god?’ ‘I saw him.’ ‘How does he fare?’ ‘His spirit .......’ ‘Did you see the spirit of him who has no funerary offerings?’ ‘I saw him.’ ‘How does he fare?’ ‘He eats the scraps and the crumbs ...... tossed out in the street.’ ‘Did you see my little stillborn children who never knew existence?’’ I saw them.’ ‘How do they fare?’ ‘They play at a table of gold and silver, laden with honey and ghee.’ ‘Did you see him who was set on fire?’ ‘I did not see him. His smoke went up to the sky. His spirit does not live in the underworld.’
Number 31
This photo shows that some skulls were plastered with clay and in this way the dead became ‘a human of earth’, similar to Enkidu. In the Gilgamesh epic two friends, Gilgamesh and Enkidu, set out to achieve eternal fame, but after some adventures the gods decide that one of them, Enkidu, must die. If one were to portray this hero it is obvious that he would be made of clay because his name itself means: 'The Son Of Lord Earth'.



Ca. 5900 B.C. Çatalhöyük became a Twin City
Number 32
This drawing shows Çatalhöyük between 6000-5900 BC. In the foreground we see the buildings on the western mound and in the background the buildings on the eastern mound. No clear reason has yet been found why people started building on the western mound at that time.
Number 33
Excavation of a trench on the West Mound.



Number 34
But when we know that Çatalhöyük is related to Gemini, I think that it is possible that building mound West made the city conform to this constellation: Mound East facing the rising sun and mount west facing the setting full moon. (But, who would believe this?)
Occupation of the West Mound of Ҫatalhöyük started later than its eastern counterpart and continued long after the desertion of the East Mound. The area between the mounds is today taken up by fields, but archaeologists believe it may once have been the location of the Çarşamba River. The mound is commonly associated with the Early Chalcolithic, the period where we first begin to see painted pottery. Available dates suggest that the mound was occupied between 5,900-5,600 BCE. Ҫatalhöyük is special in that it spans this Late Neolithic to Early Chalcolithic transition.
Reasons for the establishment of the settlement on the West Mound are not clear. One hypothesis suggests that the Çarşamba River changed its course causing people to move in order to live either closer to or further away from the water. It appears to have been a gradual transformation with cultural differences slowly emerging between the East and the West Mounds. These differences are most obvious in the buildings as we find no evidence for burials under houses, wall paintings or the infilling of abandoned houses.

If all this is true then we see how much effort has been made to reconcile a settlement with the movements of the sun and moon.



About the bear
Number 35 and 36
Because of the stamp on the right we can recognize the bear sculpture which is applied to a wall of a building. It is characteristic of bears that they hibernate in dens in winter and emerge from these dens again in spring.
Black bears begin hibernation in late October or early November. Females with cubs tend to be the first to enter dens with adult males being the last. They enter dens not because it is cold, or snowing, but as an adaptation to deal with dwindling food supplies. An abundant food supply may cause a later hibernation date but a bad food year will not cause an early hibernation date.
Black bears emerge from their dens starting in mid-March with males emerging earlier than females by about two weeks. Females with new cubs typically are the last to exit dens. Weather or elevation of den sites does not seem to effect emergence dates from year to year.
http://bearsmartdurango.org/black-bears/hibernation/
Bears sleeping in their dens may therefor symbolize 'pregnancy': on the right this concept is reinforced by the circles around the navel of the bear. The bear sculptures with their spread legs may therefore symbolize the concept of ‘giving birth’: they may indicate that gods and children were born when a new year started.



Number 37
In this picture the bear has spread its paws so that it looks like she is giving birth. With March she could give birth to the three gods represented by the cow heads below. That is first of all the sun and the moon are born in Gemini in March, and in addition Ishtar, the goddess of Sirius, because, when the sun conjuncts Gemini, it also conjuncts this star.
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple (Gudea, cylinders A and B)
The year ended and the month was completed. A new year started, a month began and three days elapsed in that month. As Ninĝirsu arrived from Eridug, beautiful moonlight shone illuminating the Land, and the E-ninnu competed with the new-born Suen.
When a new year started the moon god Suen was new-born. And so was the sun god Utu and the Sirius goddess Inanna or Ishtar. On the above picture they may have been represented by the three cow heads. Unfortunately we only know for sure that the sun god can be represented by a bison head:
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple
The true shepherd Gudea is wise, and able too to realise things. In the inner room (?) where the weapons hang, at the Gate of Battle he had the warriors Six-headed wild ram and ...... head take their stand. Facing the city, its place laden with awe, he had the Seven-headed serpent take its stand. In Šu-galam, its awesome gate, he had the Dragon and the Date palm take their stand. Facing the sunrise, where the fates are decided, he erected the standard of Utu, the Bison head, beside others already there. At the Kan-sura gate, at its lookout post, he had the Lion, the terror of the gods, take its stand. In the Tar-sirsir, where the orders are issued, he had the Fish-man and the Copper take their stand. In Bau's inner room (?), where the heart can be soothed, he had the Magilum boat and the Bison take their stand. Because these were warriors slain by Ninĝirsu, he set their mouths towards libation places. Gudea, the ruler of Lagaš, made their names appear among those of the gods.
According to this interpretation, the above photo show that in March the mother bear gives birth to the sun and moon as well as to Sirius at new year in March.



Number 38
Here is the mother ‘Big Bear’. Her front side is above Virgin and her backside is above Gemini, which means that she may have been inseminated in Virgin and that she will give birth in Gemini.
Ursa Major (/ˈɜːrsə ˈmeɪdʒər/; also known as the Great Bear) is a constellation in the northern sky, whose associated mythology likely dates back into prehistory. Its Latin name means ‘greater (or larger) she-bear,’ referring to and contrasting it with nearby Ursa Minor, the lesser bear. In antiquity, it was one of the original 48 constellations listed by Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD. Today it is the third largest of the 88 modern constellations.

Number 1
!
As mentioned before, in the centre of this beautiful statue sits Ishtar, the presiding deity of Virgo. She sits in-between two felines who represent the sun and moon in Gemini. With each new moon the sun and moon conjunct and when they went through Gemini together, they also conjunct Sirius. This situation is depicted in this sculpture: the conjunction of the sun, the moon and Sirius.
I have collected some imprint showing the same thing.
Number 39
!
On the left we also see a goddess united with two felines: here their bodies even merge.



Number 40
And also on this imprint the sun, moon and Sirius are united: their legs cross here.
Number 41
And on this imprint sun, moon and Sirius are also depicted as humans. On the left, the grains symbolize that the sun and moon fertilize Ishtar. On the right this goddess gives birth to a child.



Number 42
And in this imprint, the sun, moon and Sirius are united twice, on the left in the shape of a bull and on the right in the shape of a cow that will undoubtedly will give birth to a child. The cows with three heads obviously correspond to the three cows heads under the bear as I showed them before:
Number 37
These are my first thoughts on Catalhoyuk. I assume over time some if not all ideas will be revised. Despite all the possible faults and mistakes that have crept in, this is my first step, and we all know that the first step is the most important that can be taken.

Number 1 Seated Woman of Çatal Höyük: the head is a restoration, Museum of Anatolian Civilizations The Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük (also Çatal Höyük) is a baked-clay, nude female form, seated between feline-headed arm-rests. It is generally thought to depict a corpulent and fertile Mother Goddess in the process of giving birth while seated on her throne, which has two hand rests in the form of feline (lioness, leopard, or panther) heads in a Mistress of Animals motif. The statuette, one of several iconographically similar ones found at the site, is associated to other corpulent prehistoric goddess figures, of which the most famous is the Venus of Willendorf.
It is a Neolithic sculpture shaped by an unknown artist, and was completed in approximately 6000 BC. It was unearthed by archaeologist James Mellaart in 1961 at Çatalhöyük, Turkey. When it was found, its head and hand rest of the right side were missing. The current head and the hand rest are modern replacements. The sculpture is at the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations in Ankara, Turkey.

In northern Europe, the crow, raven, hawk, and cuckoo are associated with death and regeneration. In Ireland, the goddesses Macha, Badb, and Morrígan are shapeshifters who can be young beauties, old hags, crows, or ravens, carrying the dead to the underworld. Badb can also be a serpent goddess with a huge vulva, associated with rituals of childbirth, while the German Valkyrie is the ‘corpse-choosing’ raven. The Baltic witch Ragana is a shape-shifting.

Number 6 Painting of the south-west wall of F.V.I by Miss Raymonde Enderle Ludovic (Haydaroglu 2007) Painting one began in the south-west corner of the room and was an indented panel showing a large red stag surrounded by an assortment of men, of which seventeen survived. These were drawn in a very stylistic way, with each bearing unique features in seemingly jovial moods with their skin varying between pink and red tones. Painted with black hair, they also sported a variety of beards and black skins, assumed to be from goats and leopards. Below these figures sat three more of a smaller size and to the bottom right of the image was the figure of a naked woman and a dog (Mellaart 1966: 186). An observation made by Mellaart was that none of the figures were armed and from this it was devised that the scene did not depict a hunt, but instead something more akin to a game, with the men baiting the stag by holding onto various parts of its anatomy including its tail, tongue, nose and antlers. A similar reflection is also made by Russell and Meece who stated that the, ‘humans interact with the animals in these paintings in various ways. They seem to be teasing several’ (2005: 213)

Number 12 This poignant scene of two small children buried in front of the screen wall was excavated in 2000. The two were probably buried at the same time; both are less than ten years old. In 2001, we discovered a slightly earlier burial of a baby in the space between and below them. Their three small interlocking pits were dug through the central floor of Building 3, south of the platforms where the adult burials were found. These child burials are all earlier than the burials under the platforms.

Note the redpainted wall to their west. After each burial, the pit was filled in with earth and midden materials and then carefully plastered over with white clay. The buildings at Çatalhöyük were built out of mudbrick, or adobe, in rectangular shapes. Wooden posts supported the roofs, which were made from packed mud and reeds. Each building had one, two, or three rooms separated by thinner walls. The houses had flat roofs, which added additional work and living space. Typically, the people of Çatalhöyük entered their houses through the roof. When a building got ‘old’ and became unusable, it would be abandoned and often used as a foundation for a newer building. The layering of the buildings, which eventually formed the mound itself, is very complex: if you could cut a slice through the mound, it would look more like a honeycomb than a layer cake.

Number 27 This figure depicts a human, hybrid representation perhaps of life and death. The front portrays the typical robust female with large breasts and stomach (provocatively, the navel appears to protrude (umbilical hernia) which sometimes occurs in pregnancy); very thin arms with delineated fingers fold up to rest on the breasts. The front base of the figure is missing but it appears to be seated with legs crossed in front. Red paint is present around neck and between breasts in four concentric chains, and on the wrists and possibly the ankles. The trace of red paint in lower area suggests painted decoration seen on the ankles of other figures. The back portrays an articulated skeleton with a modelled spinal column, a pelvis and scapula’s that project above shoulders. Individual ribs and vertebrae are depicted through horizontal and diagonal scoring. A prominent dowel hole indicates that originally the piece had a separate, detachable head. A circular ‘footprint’ around the dowel hole suggests that the head fit snugly into this curved space. The figurine was plastered and shows evidence of undergoing secondary burning (darkened clay/yellowish plaster), which is especially visible on the front from arms/breasts down and diagonally down sides where plaster is missing.
