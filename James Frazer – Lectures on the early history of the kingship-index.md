PREFACE
THE following lectures were delivered at Trinity
College, Cambridge, in the Lent term of this year,
under the title of " The Sacred Character and Magical
Functions of Kings in Early Society." The general theory here sketched of the evolution of the Kingship
formed the subject of two lectures given in London
at the Royal Institution last May. In preparing the
manuscript for the press I have made a few unim
portant changes, mostly verbal, and added references
to my authorities. Otherwise the lectures are printed
as they were spoken. Substantially they consist of a series of extracts from the forthcoming third edition
of my book The Golden Eough^ which will contain
fuller information on many points.
Such prefatory remarks as I may have to make are
reserved for that work, but I cannot allow this volume
to go forth without an acknowledgment of the debt I
owe to my friend Mr. A. B. Cook, Fellow and Lecturer
of Queens' College, Cambridge. If I have been able
to present my theory of the Arician kingship in a
more probable, or at least a more precise, form than
before, I owe the improvement chiefly to the stimulating

influence of his criticisms, which obliged me to reconsider
the whole problem. Moreover, in working out my
revised theory I have profited greatly by his learning
and acumen, which he has generously placed at my
disposal in the spirit of the good old maxim KOIVO, T&

THE subject of these lectures is c< The Sacred Character
and Magical Functions of Kings in Early Society." But I must warn you at the outset that you will hear much
less about kings than from the title of the lectures you
might reasonably expect and perhaps wish to hear. The sacred character and magical functions of kings in
early society cannot be understood without some know
ledge of those general forms of superstition of which
this aspect of the kingship is a particular expression ; above all, we must acquaint ourselves with the elements
of primitive magic, since the ancient king was often
little more than the chief magician of his tribe. Several
lectures will therefore be devoted to explaining and
illustrating the elements of magic, and during their
discussion the king will apparently be lost sight of
entirely. I mention this at the beginning in order to
prevent disappointment. For the same reason, I wish



2 THE BISTORT OF INSTFrUTIONS LECT.
to say that the greater part, though not the whole, of
the lectures will consist merely of fresh examples or
illustrations of principles which I have already stated
and exemplified elsewhere ;
l and, lastly, that, apart
from a few introductory remarks, the substance of all
that I shall say will be published before long in the
new edition of my book, which is now in the press.
Before addressing myself to the special subject of the lectures, I desire to make a few general observations
on the method I have followed in them.
Anthropology, or the study of man, claims a place for itself among the sciences. Of that study or science
the history of institutions, with which we are here con
cerned, forms an important branch. It aims at tracing
the growth, development, and decay of all human insti
tutions from the earliest to the latest times, not merely
recording the facts in chronological order, but referring them to their general causes in the physical and mental
constitution of man and the influence of external nature.
Now, if we are to pursue this study in a scientific spirit,
we must endeavour to investigate the beliefs and customs
of mankind with the same rigorous impartiality with
which, for example, the zoologist investigates the habits of bees and ants. To attain that impartiality is
indeed much harder for the anthropologist than for the
zoologist, for the customs and superstitions even of the
lowest savages touch us far more nearly than the habits
even of the highest animals. The continuity of human
development has been such that most, if not all, of the
1 The Golden Bough, a Study in Magic and Religion, 2nd edition, London, 1900.



i THE SCIENTIFIC TEMPER 3
great institutions which still form the framework of
civilised society have their roots in savagery, and have
been handed down to us in these later days through
countless generations, assuming new outward forms in
the process of transmission, but remaining in their
inmost core substantially unchanged. Such, for
example, to take a few conspicuous instances, are the
institution of private property, the institution of
marriage, the institution of war, and the worship of
a god. Differences of opinion may exist, and have
existed, as to the precise value of the inheritance ; as to
the fact of it there can be none. Thus in treating even
of the rudest savages it is not easy, if I may say so, to
keep our eyes fixed inflexibly on the object immediately before us. For we seem to be standing at the sources
of human history, and it is difficult to exclude from our
mind the thought of the momentous consequences which
in other ages and other lands have flowed from these
simple beginnings, often from these apparently harmless absurdities. And the further we descend the stream of
history, and the nearer we approach to our own age and
country, the harder it becomes to maintain an impartial
attitude in the investigation of institutions which have
been fraught with so much happiness and so much
misery for mankind. Yet, if we are to succeed in the
inquiry, we must endeavour to approach it without
prejudice and to pursue it without passion, bearing in mind that our aim is simply the ascertainment of truth,
not the apportionment of praise or blame ; that we are
not judges, still less advocates, but merely inquirers ;



4 THE DEDUCTIVE METHOD LECT.
that it is for us, in the language of Spinoza, humanas
actiones non ridere, non lugere, neque detestari, sed
intelligere^ A science which rests on observation, as all the
historical sciences necessarily do, may be taught in one
of two ways. Either we may begin with a statement
of general principles and then proceed to illustrate it by individual cases ; or, on the contrary, we may begin
with the individual cases and from a comparison of them
with each other may endeavour to elicit those general
laws which, in common parlance, are said to govern the
particulars. The former is the deductive method, the
latter is the inductive.
Both methods have, like most other things, their
respective advantages and disadvantages. The deduc
tive method is, in appearance at least, the more scientific.
There is an air of completeness, symmetry, and precision
about it which is very taking. It gives us a bird's-eye
view of a subject which is easily grasped by the mind
and retained by the memory. It is thus admirably
adapted for exposition on the side of the teacher, and
for learning on the side of the pupil. In other words,
it is the best mode of imparting and acquiring informa
tion, whether for the sake of examinations or for higher
ends. For such purposes the inductive method is
nearly useless. It plunges us at once into such a sea of
1 Spinoza, Tractatus Politicus, i. 4 : " Cum igitur animum ad Po/iticam applicucrim, nihil quod nwum -vel inuuditum est, sed tan turn ea, quae cum praxi oftime cotrveniunt, certa et indubitata rations demonstrare, out ex ipsa humanae naturae condition* deducere intendi ; et ut ea, quae ad hanc scientiam spectant, eadem an'iml libertatc, qua ref Mathematical
ulemus, inquirerem, sedulo curavi, humanas actiones non ridere, non lugere, neque detestari,
sed intelligere.''''



i THE INDUCTIVE METHOD 5
particulars that it is difficult at first to find our bearings,
that is, to perceive the general principles which are to reduce this seeming chaos to order. To adopt a
common and expressive phrase, it is hard to see the
wood for the trees. Yet the serious disadvantage under
which the inductive method thus labours is perhaps
more than compensated in another direction by one
solid advantage-; it is the method of discovery. In all
sciences which rest on observation, discovery must ulti
mately proceed from the particular to the general, from the isolated observed instances to the abstract conception
which binds them together. Apparent exceptions there
are, but on examination they will always, I believe, be
found to conform to the rule. Thus if the inductive
method is unsuited to the acquisition, it is well suited
to the extension, of knowledge ; if it does not train a
student for examinations, it trains him for research.
Apart from this general advantage possessed by the inductive method, there is a special reason why anthro
pology should adhere to it at the present time. In
order to make a sound induction large collections of
facts are necessary ; hence in the inductive sciences it
is essential that a period of collection should precede
a period of generalisation. Not until great masses of observations have been accumulated and classified do
the general laws which pervade them begin to appear
on the surface. Now anthropology in general and the
history of institutions in particular arc still in the
collecting stage. The prime want of the study is not
so much theories as facts. This is especially true of



6 STUDY OF THE SAVAGE LECT.
that branch of the study which treats of origins ; for,
as I have said, most great institutions may be traced
back to savagery, and consequently for the early history of mankind the savage is our most precious document.
It is only of late years that the document has received
the attention it deserves ; and unfortunately it is perish
ing under our eyes. Contact with civilisation is rapidly
effacing the old beliefs and customs of the savage, and
is thereby obliterating records of priceless value for the history of our race. The most urgent need of anthro
pology at present is to procure accurate accounts of the
existing customs and ideas of savages before they have
disappeared. When these have been obtained, when
the records existing in our libraries have been fully
scrutinised, and when the whole body of information
has been classified and digested, the philosophic his
torian will be able to formulate, with a fair degree of
probability, those general laws which have shaped the intellectual, social, and moral evolution of mankind.
That will not be done in our day. The great
thinkers, the Newtons and Darwins of anthropology, will
come after us. It is our business to prepare for them
by collecting, sifting, and arranging the records in order that when, in the fulness of time, the master-mind
shall arise and survey them, he may be able to detect
at once that unity in multiplicity, that universal in the
particulars, which has escaped us. The duty at present incumbent on the investigator is therefore to rake
together the facts, whether, like some of my friends, he
goes for them at the peril of his life to savage lands,



i ROUSSEAU'S DREAM 7
or merely unearths them at his ease from the dust of
libraries. The time has gone by when dreamers like
Rousseau could reconstruct the history of society out
of their own minds, and their dreams could be accepted
as visions of a golden age to come, their voices listened
to like angel trumpets heralding the advent of a new heaven and a new earth. It is not for the anthro
pologist of to-day to blow these high notes, to build
these gay castles in the clouds. His task is the soberer,
duller one of laying, in the patient accumulation of
facts, the foundations of a structure more solid and
enduring than the glittering fantasies of Rousseau's
dream. Yet he too may prove in the end to be a
pioneer of revolution, a revolution all the surer and
more lasting because it will be slow and peaceful.
Thus the method of anthropology is induction,
and at present its students are engaged in compiling and arranging their materials rather than in evolving
general theories out of them. Yet a certain amount
of preliminary generalisation is legitimate and indeed necessary. The work even of observation can hardly
be accomplished without some intermixture of theory
to direct the observer's attention to points which he
might otherwise overlook or regard as too insignifi
cant to be worthy of record. But these provisional
hypotheses should be held very loosely ; we must
always be ready to modify or discard them when they
are found to conflict with fresh evidence. The advance
of knowledge in this, as in every other field, consists in
a progressive readjustment of theory to fact, of con



OBSTACLES TO STUDT LECT.
ception to perception, of thought to experience ; and
as that readjustment, though more and more exact, can
never be perfect, the advance is infinite.
These considerations may serve to justify or at least
excuse two features of anthropological books of the
present day which are apt to repel students who might otherwise be attracted to the subject. One of these
features is the apparently disproportionate space occu
pied by the bare description and cataloguing of facts, which soon pall on the reader by their number and
monotony. The other is the unstable, shifting, dis
cordant nature of the theories put forward to explain
the facts. Both features are to be regretted, but they
can hardly be avoided at the present stage of inquiry. The bearing of these remarks lies, as Captain Cuttle
profoundly observed, in their application. In my book I have followed the inductive method, and I intend to
adhere to it in my lectures. I started without any
general theory of the nature and evolution of the king
ship in early society. The rule of one particular Italian
kingship had long puzzled me till I happened to meet with a similar rule in southern India which seemed to
throw light on the Italian custom. As soon as I began
to formulate my explanation of the two, many kindred,
but hitherto apparently disconnected, facts came crowd
ing in upon me, offering, as I thought, the materials for a fairly probable induction as to certain aspects of the
kingly office in early society. Thus what I at first
intended to be merely an explanation of one particular
kingship gradually developed into something like a



i THE KING OF THE tTOOD 9
treatise on the sanctity of the old kings in general.
For my purpose it was therefore essential to enumerate
and describe in detail the facts on which I based my
induction, since for the most part, so far as I am aware,
they had not been put together before. I shall follow the
same method for the same reasons in my lectures. The
principles which I shall discuss will generally be old,
and may be trite to some of you. But the evidence
by which I shall illustrate them will for the most part
be new, by which I only mean that it has not been
published before in my book. If you should find the
facts which I shall inflict on you even more tedious
than my theories, you will have the consolation of
remembering that they are incomparably more valuable. The particular case of a sacred kingship which
served as the starting-point of my investigation was the priesthood of Diana at Nemi, which combined the
regal with the sacred character ; for the priest bore the
title of Rex Nemorensis or King of the Wood, and his
office was called a kingdom. As my general inquiry into the early kingship thus centres round Nemi, I shall
invite your attention to it for a few minutes before we
pass to the survey of a wider field. I shall not detain
you long on what to some may be familiar ground, and
I shall avoid as far as possible all repetition of what I
have already published.
The Alban hills arc a fine bold group of volcanic
mountains which rise abruptly from the Campagna in
full view of Rome, forming the last spur sent out by



io THE LAKE OF NEMI LECT.
the Apennines towards the sea. Two of the extinct
craters are now filled by two beautiful waters, the Alban
lake and its lesser sister the lake of Nemi. Both lie
far below the monastery-crowned top of Monte Cavo,
the summit of the range, but yet so high above the plain
that standing on the rim of the larger crater, at Castel
Gandolfo, where the popes had their summer palace,
you look down on the one hand into the Alban lake,
and on the other away across the Campagna to where,
on the western horizon, the sea flashes like a broad
sheet of burnished gold in the sun.
The lake of Nemi is still, as of old, embowered in
woods, where the wild flowers blow in spring as freshly
as no doubt they did two thousand springs ago. It
lies so deep down in the old crater that the calm sur
face of its clear water is seldom ruffled by the wind.
On all sides but one the banks, thickly mantled with
vegetation, descend steeply to the water's edge. Only on the north a stretch of flat ground intervenes between
the lake and the foot of the hills. Here, under the
abrupt declivity now crested by the village of Nemi, the sylvan goddess Diana had an old and famous
sanctuary, the resort of pilgrims from all parts of Latium. It was known as the sacred grove of Diana
Nemorensis, that is, Diana of the Wood, or perhaps more exactly, Diana of the Woodland Glade. Some
times the lake and grove were called, after the nearest
town, the Jake and grove of Aricia. A spacious terrace
or platform, some seven hundred feet long, contained
the sanctuary. On the north and east it was bounded



i DIANA'S SHRINE 1 1
by great retaining walls which cut into the hillsides and
served to support them. Semicircular niches sunk in
the walls and faced with columns formed a series of
chapels, which in modern times have yielded a rich
harvest of votive offerings. Compared with the extent
of the sacred precinct, the temple itself was not large ;
but its ruins prove it to have been neatly and solidly
built of peperino and adorned with Doric columns.
Elaborate cornices of marble and friezes of terra-cotta
contributed to the outward splendour of the edifice,
which appears to have been further enhanced by tiles of
gilt bronze. 1
The great wealth and popularity of the sanctuary in antiquity are attested by ancient writers as well as by
the remains which have come to light in modern times.
In the civil war its sacred treasures went to replenish the
empty coffers of Octavian. 2 But we are not told that
he treated Diana as civilly as his uncle Julius Caesar
once treated Capitoline Jupiter, borrowing three thousand pounds weight of solid gold from the god
and scrupulously paying him back in the same weight
of gilt copper.8 However, the sanctuary at Nemi recovered from the drain on its resources, for two
centuries later it was still reputed one of the richest in

12 THE OFFERINGS OF PILGRIMS LECT.
Italy.
1 Ovid has described the walls hung with fillets
and commemorative tablets ;
2 and the abundance of
cheap votive offerings and copper coins, which the site
has yielded in our time, speaks volumes for the piety
and numbers, if not for the opulence and liberality, of
the worshippers. Swarms of beggars used to stream
forth daily from the slums of Aricia and take their
stand on the long slope up which the labouring horses
dragged well-to-do pilgrims to the shrine ; and accord
ing to the response which their whines and importunities
met with they blew kisses or hissed curses after the
carriages as they swept rapidly down hill again.
3 Even
peoples and potentates of the East did homage to the
lady of the lake by setting up monuments in her
sanctuary ; and within the precinct stood shrines of the
Egyptian goddesses Isis and Bubastis, with a store of
gorgeous jewellery.
4
The retirement of the spot and the beauty of the
landscape naturally tempted some of the luxurious Roman nobles to fix their summer residences by the
lake. Here Lucius Caesar had a house to which, on a
day in early summer, only two months after the murder
of his illustrious namesake, he invited Cicero to meet
the assassin Brutus. 5 The emperors themselves appear
to have been partial to a retreat where they could find

i THE EMPERORS AT NEMI 13
repose from the cares of state and the bustle of the
great city in the fresh air of the lake and the stillness of
the woods. Here Julius Caesar built himself a costly
villa, but pulled it down again because it was not to his
mind. 1 Here Caligula caused two magnificent barges, or rather floating palaces, to be launched for him on the
lake ;
2 and it was while dallying in the woods of Nemi
that the sluggard Vitellius received those tidings of
revolt which woke him from his dream of pleasure and
called him to arms. 3 Vespasian had a monument dedi
cated to his honour in the grove by the senate and
people of Aricia : Trajan condescended to fill the chief
magistracy of the town ; and Hadrian indulged in his
taste for architecture by restoring a structure which had
been erected in the precinct by a prince of the royal
house of Parthia.4
Such, then, was the sanctuary of Diana at Nemi, a
fitting home for the " mistress of mountains and forests
green and lonely glades and sounding rivers/* as Catullus
calls her.5
Multitudes of her statuettes, appropriately clad in
the short tunic and high buskins of a huntress, with the
quiver slung over her shoulder, have been found on the
spot. Some of them represent her with her bow in her
hand or her hound at her side. Bronze and iron spears,
and images of stags and hinds, discovered within the

precinct, may have been the offerings of huntsmen to
the huntress goddess for success in the chase. Similarly
the bronze tridents, which have come to light at Nemi,
were perhaps presented by fishermen who had speared fish in the lake, or maybe by hunters who had stabbed
boars in the forest. For the wild boar was still hunted
in Italy down to the end of the first century of our
era. The younger Pliny tells us how, with his usual
pretty affectation, he sat meditating and reading by the nets, while three fine boars fell into them. 1 Indeed,
some fourteen hundred years later boar-hunting was a
favourite pastime of Pope Leo the Tenth. 2 A few rude
images of cows, oxen, horses, and pigs dug up on the
site may perhaps indicate that Diana was here worshipped
as the patroness of domestic animals as well as of the
wild creatures of the wood. In like manner her Greek
counterpart, Artemis, was a goddess not only of game but of herds. Thus her sanctuary in the highlands of
north-western Arcadia, between Clitor and Cynasthae,
owned sacred cattle which were driven off by Aetolian
freebooters on one of their forays.
3 When Xenophon
returned from the wars and settled on his estate among
the wooded hills and green meadows of the rich valley
through which the Alpheus flows past Olympia, he dedicated to Artemis a little temple on the model of her
great temple at Ephesus, surrounded it with a grove of all kinds of fruit-trees, and endowed it not only with a
chase but also with a sacred pasture. The chase
1 Pliny, Epist. \. 6. 2 W. Roscoe, Life and Pontificate of Leo the TentA,3 iv. 376. 3 Polybius, Hist. iv. 18 and 19.



i ANCIENT ITALY 15
abounded in fish and game of all sorts, and the pasture
sufficed to rear swine, goats, oxen, and horses ; and at
her yearly festival the pious soldier sacrificed to the
goddess a tithe both of the cattle from the sacred
pasture and of the game from the sacred chase. 1 Again,
the people of Hyampolis in Phocis worshipped Artemis and thought that no cattle throve like those which they
dedicated to her. 2 Perhaps, then, the images of cattle
found in Diana's precinct at Nemi were offered to her
by herdsmen to ensure her blessing on their herds.
So to the last, in spite of a few villas peeping out
here and there among the trees, Nemi seems to have
remained in some sense an image of what Italy had
been in the far-off days when the land was still
sparsely peopled with tribes of savage hunters or
wandering herdsmen, when the beechwoods and oak
woods, with their deciduous foliage, reddening in autumn and bare in winter, had not yet begun, under
the hand of man, to yield to the evergreens of the south,
the laurel, the olive, the cypress, and the oleander, still
less to those intruders of a later age, which nowadays
we are apt to think of as characteristically Italian, the
lemon and the orange.

1 6 THE PRIEST OF NEMI
But that is modern rather than ancient Italy.
However, it was not merely in its natural surround
ings that this ancient shrine of the sylvan goddess
continued to be a type or miniature of the past.
Down to the decline of Rome a custom was observed
here which seems to transport us at once from
civilisation to savagery. The priest of the goddess
bore the title of king, and his office was called a
kingdom, but his tenure of the throne was a singular
one. He was a runaway slave, who succeeded to
office by slaying his predecessor, and he held it only so long as he could make good his title in single
combat against all assailants. Any fugitive slave who
contrived to break a branch from a certain tree in
the grove had the right to fight the priest, and if
he killed him he reigned in his stead. Naturally,
therefore, the priest kept watch and ward over that
tree. The Greek geographer Strabo, who appears
to have seen him, describes him as always sword in
hand, always on the alert. 1 His eyes probably acquired
that restless, watchful look which, among the Esquimaux
of Bering Strait, is said to betray infallibly the shedder
of blood ; for with that people revenge is a sacred duty,
and the manslayer carries his life in his hand. 2
Of the worship of Diana at Nemi there are two

to bear in mind. In the first place, the votive offerings
found on the spot prove that the goddess was believed
to bless men and women with offspring and to grant
expectant mothers an easy delivery.
1 In the second
place, fire seems to have played a foremost part in
her ritual. At her annual festival of the thirteenth
of August her grove was illuminated, and women
whose prayers had been heard by her came crowned
with wreaths and bearing lighted torches to the
sanctuary in fulfilment of their vows.2 Some one
unknown dedicated a perpetually burning lamp in a little shrine at Nemi for the safety of the Emperor
Claudius and his family.8 The terra-cotta lamps which
have been discovered in the grove 4 may perhaps have
served a like purpose for humbler persons. If so, the
analogy of the custom to the Catholic practice of
dedicating holy candles in churches would be obvious.
Moreover, the tide of Vesta borne by Diana at
Ncmi 5
points clearly to the maintenance of a perpetual
holy fire in her sanctuary. A large circular basement
at the north-east corner of the temple, raised on three
steps and bearing traces of a mosaic pavement, probably supported a round temple of Diana in her character of

Vesta, like the round temple of Vesta in the Roman
forum. 1 The true character of this circular basement
was first perceived and pointed out by my acute and
learned friend Mr. A. B. Cook. 2 Previous writers
had taken it for an altar or pedestal. The sacred fire
at Nemi would seem to have been tended by Vestal
Virgins, for the head of a Vestal in terra- cotta was
found on the spot,
3 and the worship of a perpetual fire,
cared for by holy maidens, appears to have been
common in Latium from the earliest to the latest
times. 4 For example, we know that among the ruins
of Alba Longa the Vestal fire was kept burning by
Vestal Virgins to the end of the fourth century of our
era. 5
At the annual festival of Diana, which was held all
over Italy on the thirteenth of August, hunting dogs were crowned and wild beasts were not molested ;
wine was brought forth, and the feast consisted of a
kid, cakes, and apples still hanging in clusters on the
boughs. 6 The Christian Church appears to have
sanctified this great festival of the virgin goddess by
adroitly converting it into the festival of the
Assumption of the Blessed Virgin on the fifteenth
of August. 7 The discrepancy of two days between

the dates of the festivals is not a fatal argument against
their identity ; for a similar displacement of two days
occurs in the case of St. George's festival on the twenty
third of April, which is most probably identical with the
ancient Roman festival of the Parilia on April twenty
first. 1 As to the reasons which prompted this con
version of the festival of the Virgin Diana into the
festival of the Virgin Mary some light is thrown by
the records of the Eastern Church. Thus in the
Syriac text of the treatise called The Departure of my
Lady Mary from this World an account is given of the
reasons which led to the institution of the festival of
the Assumption of the Virgin in August. In the English version of the treatise the passage runs thus :
"And the apostles ordered also that there should be
a commemoration of the blessed one on the thirteenth
of Ab [that is, August : observe that the thirteenth
of August is Diana's own day ; another manu
script or manuscripts read on the fifteenth of Ab], on account of the vines bearing bunches (of grapes),
and on account of the trees bearing fruit, that clouds of
hail, bearing stones of wrath, might not come, and the
trees be broken, and their fruits, and the vines with
their clusters." 2 Here you will observe that the
festival of the Assumption of the Virgin is definitely said to have been fixed on the thirteenth or fifteenth of
August for the sake of protecting the ripening grapes

and other fruits. This interesting passage was pointed out to me by my learned friend Mr. Rendel Harris.
Since then I find that an inference of the same sort has
been drawn independently from this passage by the late
Professor Lucius of Strasburg in a book published at
the end of last year, where he reinforces the argument
by other evidence. 1 Thus he points out that in the
calendars of the Syrian Church the fifteenth of August
is repeatedly designated as the Festival of the Mother
of God for the vines, and that in the Arabic text of the
apocryphal work On the -passing of the Blessed Virgin Mary, attributed to the Apostle John, there occurs the
following passage : " Also a festival in her honour was
instituted on the fifteenth day of the month Ab [that
is, August], which is the day of her passing from this
world, the day on which the miracles were performed,
and the time when the fruits of trees are ripening."
Now we hear of vineyards and plantations dedicated to
Artemis, fruits offered to her, and her temple standing
in an orchard.3 Hence we may conjecture that her
Italian sister Diana was also revered as a patroness of
vines and fruit-trees, and that on the thirteenth of
August the owners of vineyards and orchards paid their
respects to her at Nemi in order to ensure the safety of
the ripening fruit. We have just seen that wine and

apples still hanging on the boughs were part of the
festal cheer on that day. We know, too, that Diana
was believed to fill the husbandman's barns with a
bounteous harvest, 1 and in a series of gems, she is repre
sented with a branch of fruit in one hand, and a cup,
which is sometimes full of fruit, in the other.* Even in
Scandinavia a relic of the worship of Diana survived
in the custom of blessing the fruits of the earth of
every sort, which in Catholic times was annually
observed at the festival of the Assumption of the
Virgin on the fifteenth of August. 8
There is, I need hardly say, no intrinsic improb
ability in the view that for the sake of edification the
Church may have converted a real heathen festival
into a nominal Christian one. My learned friend Mr.
F. C. Conybeare of Oxford has furnished me with an
undoubted instance of such a transformation. He tells
me that in the Armenian Church, " according to the
express evidence of the Armenian fathers of the year
700 and later, the day of the Virgin was placed on
September the fifteenth, because that was the day of
Anahite, the magnificence of whose feast the Christian
doctors hoped thereby to transfer to Mary." This
Anahite or Anaitis, as the Greeks called her, the
Armenian predecessor of the Virgin Mary, was a
great Oriental goddess whose worship was exceedingly
popular not only in Armenia but in the adjoining

countries. The character of her rites is plainly in
dicated by Strabo, 1 himself a native of these regions.
A mythical personage of some interest and import
ance at Nemi was the water-nymph Egeria. The
purling of her stream as it flowed over the pebbles is
mentioned by Ovid, who tells us that he had often
drunk of its water. 2 Women with child used to
sacrifice to Egeria, because she was believed, like
Diana, to be able to grant them an easy delivery.
3
Tradition ran that the nymph had been the wife or
mistress of the wise king Numa, that he had consorted
with her in the secrecy of the sacred grove, and that
the laws which he gave the Romans had been inspired
by commune with her divinity.
4 Plutarch compares
the legend with other tales of the loves of goddesses
for mortal men, such as the loves of Cybele and
the Moon for the fair youths Attis and Endymion.
According to some, the trysting-place of the lovers Numa and Egeria was not in the woods of Nemi,
but at Rome, in a grove outside the dripping Porta
Capena, where another sacred spring of Egeria gushed from a dark cavern. 5 Every day the Roman Vestals

fetched water from this spring to wash the temple of
Vesta, carrying it in earthenware pitchers on their
heads. 1 In Juvenal's time the natural rock had been
encased in marble, and the hallowed spot was profaned
by gangs of poor Jews, who were suffered to squat,
like gypsies, in the grove. We may suppose that the spring which fell into the lake of Nemi was the true
original Egeria, and that when the first settlers moved
down from the Alban hills to the banks of the Tiber
they brought the nymph with them and found a new
home for her in a grove outside the gates.
The remains of baths which have been discovered
within the sacred precinct,
2 together with many terra
cotta models of various parts of the human body,
suggest that the waters of Egeria were perhaps used
to heal the sick, who may have declared their hopes
or testified their gratitude by dedicating likenesses
of the diseased members to the goddess, in accordance
with a practice which still prevails in many parts of Europe. To this day it would seem that the spring
of Egeria retains medicinal virtues.8
Here I may mention a fine double bust in marble of
two water-gods which has been found in the precinct at
Nemi. Their heads are turned back to back. One
of them is that of a bearded man, the other that of a
beardless youth. Their matted hair is tossed wildly

from their brows and from the mouth of the younger ;
water-plants cling to their breasts, and similar plants
or fish-scales to their cheeks. Both have that wild
and troubled look which the ancient artists, with their
exquisite taste, loved to give to divinities of the fickle
and restless element. The busts are probably the
work of a skilful artist of the first century of our era.
Inscriptions seem to prove that they were dedicated
to Diana. 1
The last of the mythical beings at Nemi to whom
I have to ask your attention is Virbius. Legend had
it that Virbius was no other than the young Greek
hero Hippolytus whose story is familiar to you all.
Two points in it must be borne in mind ; first, he was
the favourite of Artemis, the Greek equivalent of
Diana, and second, he was killed by his horses, which
dragged him at their hoofs to death. But his divine
mistress, so runs the tale, had Hippolytus brought
to life again, and transported him to the woods of
Nemi, where she entrusted him to the nymph Egeria.
There he reigned as a king under the name of Virbius,
and there he dedicated a sacred precinct to his patroness
Diana. 2 As to the real character of this mythical
Virbius the ancients appear to have been doubtful.
Some thought that he was the sun. " But the truth
is," says Servius, " that he is a deity associated

with Diana, as Attis is associated with the Mother
of the Gods, and Erichthonius with Minerva, and
Adonis with Venus." 1 This statement of the old
commentator on Virgil I believe to be of the utmost
importance for the understanding both of the Arician
worship in general and of the extraordinary rule of
succession to the priesthood in particular. I greatly regret that in former editions of my book I missed its
significance entirely. The view which it implies of the character of Virbius will form the pivot on which
a good deal of our subsequent researches will revolve.
Here I will only remark that in his Jong and chequered
career this mythical personage Hippolytus or Virbius
has displayed a remarkable tenacity of life. For we
can hardly doubt that the Saint Hippolytus of the
Roman calendar, who was dragged by horses to death
on the thirteenth of August, Diana's own day, is no
other than the Greek hero of the same name, who,
after dying twice over as a heathen sinner, has been
happily resuscitated as a Christian saint. 2 The merit
of tracing the saint's pedigree belongs to Mr. Rendel
Harris, who has distinguished himself by other kindred
researches in this department of sacred history.
8
We can now perhaps understand why the ancients
identified Hippolytus, the companion of Artemis, with
Virbius, who, according to Servius, stood to Diana

26 DIANA'S MATE LECT.
as Adonis to Venus, or Attis to Cybele. For Diana,
like Artemis, appears to have been originally a goddess
of fertility in general and of childbirth in particular.
1
As such she, like her Greek counterpart, needed a
male partner. That partner, if Servius is right, was
Virbius. In his character of the founder of the sacred
grove and first king of Nemi, Virbius is clearly the
mythical predecessor or archetype of the line of priests who served Diana under the title of Kings of the
Wood, and who came, one after the other, to a violent
end. 2 It is natural, therefore, to conjecture that these
priestly kings stood to the goddess of the grove in the same relation in which Virbius stood to her ; in short,
that the mortal King of the Wood had for his queen
the woodland Diana herself. 3
Reviewing the evidence as a whole, we may conclude
that the worship of Diana in her sacred grove at Nemi
was of great importance and immemorial antiquity ; that she was revered as the goddess of woodlands and
of wild creatures, probably also of domestic cattle and
of the fruits of the earth ; that she was believed to
bless men and women with offspring and to aid mothers
in childbed ; that her holy fire, tended by chaste
virgins, burned perpetually in a round temple within the precinct ; that associated with her was a water
nymph Egeria, who discharged one of Diana's own
1 See, for example, Catullus's fine poem on her (No. xxxiv.).
2 This was pointed out long ago by P. Buttmann (Myt/io/ogus, ii. 151).
3 Seneca speaks of Diana as " reglna nemorum " or " Queen of the Woods "
(Hippo/ytus, 406), perhaps with a reminiscence of the Rex Nemorensis, as Mr. A. B. Cook has suggested (Classical Review, October 1902, p. 373, n. 3).

functions by succouring women in travail, and who was
popularly supposed to have mated with an old Roman
king in the sacred grove ; further, that Diana of the
Wood herself had a male companion, Virbius by name,
who was to her what Adonis was to Venus, or Attis to
Cybele ; and, lastly, that this mythical Virbius was
represented in historical times by a line of priests
known as the Kings of the Wood, who regularly
perished by the swords of their successors, and whose
lives were in a manner bound up with a certain tree in
the grove, because, so long as that tree was uninjured,
they were safe from attack.
This ends what I have to say on Nemi for the
present. In the next lecture we shall begin our study
of the general principles of magic.

IN the last lecture we began our consideration of the
position of the king in early society. I indicated briefly
that the character of sanctity which attaches to the king
ship among many savage and barbarous peoples is a product of certain primitive modes of thought and of habits
based on them, which are very alien to our ways of
thinking and acting, and can only be understood after
long and patient study. Instead of attempting to lay
down a general scheme of the development of the sacred
kingship in early society, I took as the starting-point of
our inquiries a particular example of the institution,
namely, the titular kingship of the priests of Diana at
Nemi ; and I think that this mode of proceeding may
be justified, not only by the greater definiteness and
precision which we attain by considering an abstract
problem in a concrete form, but also by the many
28



LECT. ii PRIESTLT KINGS 29
interesting questions which are raised by this particular
kingship. In the present lecture I propose to begin the examination of these questions. They can only be
adequately answered by the comparative method, and
accordingly, leaving Nemi and the King of the Wood behind for the present, we must now look about for
other examples of sacred kingships and try to discover
the ideas on which the institution is based.
In the first place, then, we saw that the King of the
Wood at Nemi, though he bore the kingly title, was, in
historical times at any rate, much more a priest than a
king. Now this union of priestly duties with a royal
title was common in classical antiquity. Rome and
Athens furnish the most familiar examples of the
practice, but it existed also in many other places. In
Greece the duties of these priestly kings, as we learn
from Aristotle, were especially associated with the
Common Hearth of the city.
1 In the island of Cos, for
example, the titular king sacrificed to Hestia, the god
dess of the hearth, the equivalent of the Italian Vesta ;
and he received the hide and one leg of the victim as
his perquisite.
2 In Mytilene the kings, of whom there
were several, invited to banquets at the Common
Hearth those guests whom the state delighted to
honour. 8 In Chios also there were several kings, and
if any herdsman or shepherd drove his cows, his sheep,
or his swine to pasture in a sacred grove, the first person

30 PRIESTLT KINGS LECT.
who witnessed the transgression was bound to denounce
the transgressor to the kings, under pain of incurring the divine wrath and, what perhaps was more serious,
of having to pay a fine to the offended deity.
1
In the same island the king was charged with the duty
of pronouncing the public curses,2 a spiritual weapon of which much use was made by the ancients. For
example, in Teos, public curses were levelled at any one
who should prevent the importation of corn into the
country. " If any man," so ran the curse, u shall by
any manner of means prevent the importation of corn
into the land of the Teans, may he perish, he and his
family." But that, I need hardly inform you, was in
the dark ages, before the invention of tariff reform.
The Teans, it is obvious, were " free-fooders."
You will observe that all these titular kings whom I
have mentioned held office in republican states. The
general opinion of the ancients seems to have been that
such priestly kingships were instituted after the abolition
of the monarchy in order to offer the sacrifices and to
discharge the religious duties which had formerly fallen within the province of the real king.
4 The view is not
improbable in itself, and it is moreover confirmed by a
case in which the descendants of the old kings are
known as a matter of history to have retained a shadowy

royalty after the real power had departed from them.
At Ephesus the descendants of the Ionian Icings, who
traced their pedigree to Codrus, king of Athens, kept
the title of king and certain privileges, such as the right
to a seat of honour at the games, to wear a purple robe
and carry a staff instead of a sceptre, and to preside at
the rites of Eleusinian Demeter. 1 So at Cyrene, when
the monarchy was abolished, the deposed King Battus
was assigned certain domains and allowed to retain some
priestly functions.2
Thus the classical evidence points to the conclusion
that in prehistoric ages, before the rise of the republican form of government, the various tribes or cities were
ruled by kings, who discharged priestly duties and probably enjoyed a sacred character as descendants of
deities. This conclusion is borne out by the example
of Sparta, where the monarchy survived to historical
times. For there the two kings were believed to be
descended from the supreme god Zeus ; as his offspring
they offered all the state sacrifices, received a share of
the victims, and held the priesthood of Zeus, one of
them acting as priest of Zeus Lacedaemon, the other as
priest of Heavenly Zeus.8
This combination of royal authority with priestly functions is common in many parts of the world and
hardly calls for illustration. To take a single example,
among the Matabeles of South Africa the king is at the

same time high-priest. Every year he offers sacrifices
at the great and the little dance, and also at the festival
of the new fruits, which ends these dances. On these
occasions he prays to the spirits of his forefathers and
likewise to his own spirit ; for it is from these higher
powers that he expects every blessing.
1
This example is instructive, because it shows that the
king is something more than a priest. He prays not
only to the spirits of his fathers, but to his own spirit.
He is clearly raised above the common standard of mere
humanity ; there is something divine about him.
Similarly, we may suppose that the Spartan kings were
regarded not merely as descended from the great god Zeus but also as partaking of his divine spirit. This is
clearly indicated by a curious Spartan belief mentioned
by Herodotus, to which I do not remember that
attention has been paid by modern writers. The old
historian tells us that formerly both the Spartan kings
went forth with the army to battle, but that in later
times a rule was made that when one king marched out
to fight, the other should stay at home. " And
accordingly," says Herodotus, " one of the kings
remaining at home, one of the Tyndarids is left there too ; for hitherto both of them were invoked and
followed the kings." The Tyndarids, I need hardly
say, are the heavenly twins, Castor and Pollux, the sons
of Zeus. The belief described by Herodotus clearly

ii CASTOR AND POLLUX 33
implies that one of these divine beings was supposed to
be in constant attendance on each of the two Spartan
kings, staying with them where they stayed and going with them wherever they went. From this we may
reasonably infer that they were thought to aid the
kings, their kinsmen, with their advice and counsel in
time of need. Now Castor and Pollux are commonly
represented as spearmen, and they were constantly associated or identified, not only with stars, but also
with those lurid lights which, in an atmosphere charged
with electricity, are sometimes seen to play round the
mastheads of ships under a murky sky. Moreover,
similar lights were observed by the ancients to glitter in
the darkness on the points of spears. Pliny tells us
that he had seen such lights flickering on the spears of
Roman sentinels as they paced their rounds by night in

l and it is said that Cossacks, riding
across the steppes on stormy nights, perceive glimmerings of the same sort at their lance-heads. 2 Since,
therefore, the divine brothers Castor and Pollux were
believed to be in constant attendance on the Spartan
kings, it seems not impossible that they may have been
thought to accompany the march of a Spartan army, appearing in the twilight or in the darkness either as
stars in the sky or as the sheen of spears on earth. It
might further be worth while to consider how far the
stories of the appearance of the heavenly twins in battle,
charging on their milk-white steeds at the head of the

earthly chivalry, may not have originated in similar
lights seen to glitter in the gloaming on a point here and there in the long hedge of levelled or ported spears.
I mean that any two riders on white horses whose
spear-heads happened to be touched by the mystic light might easily be taken for Castor and Pollux in person.
If there is any truth in this conjecture and it is only a
conjecture we should conclude that the divine brothers
were never seen in broad day, but only at dusk or in
the darkness of night. Now their most famous appear
ance was at the battle of Lake Regillus, as to which we
are expressly told that it was late in the evening of a
summer day before the fighting was over. 1 Such state
ments ought not lightly to be dismissed as late inven
tions of a rhetorical historian. The memories of great
battles linger long among the peasantry of the neighbourhood.
However that may be, the evidence of Hero
dotus suffices to prove that an intimate relation
was believed to exist between the two Spartan kings
and the divine twins Castor and Pollux. And in
general there is no doubt that in early society kings have been often thought to be not merely descendants of
divinities, but themselves divine and invested with super
natural powers. Thus they are frequently expected to give rain and sunshine in due season, to make the crops
grow, and so forth. In short, they are considered and
treated as incarnate gods. In early society the divinity
that doth hedge a king is no mere figure of speech.
1 Dionysius Halicarn. Ant. Rom. vi. 135 Cicero, De natura deorum, ii. 2. 6.



ii TTPES OF M4N-GOD 35
Of these incarnate human gods it is convenient to
distinguish two types. In the one type the indwelling divinity is conceived as a spirit which has taken up its
abode in the man, whether at birth or at a later time ; in
the other type it consists essentially in the possession of
magical powers of a very high order. Accordingly the one may be called the inspired, the other the magical
man-god. Strictly perhaps, according to our notions, the inspired type alone is entitled to rank as a god,
while the other is merely a glorified magician. But such sharp distinctions are not drawn by primitive man.
To him the two conceptions shade off into each other ;
perhaps he might find it hard to define or even perceive
the difference between them. Certainly it would not
be easy to refer all particular instances definitely to one
or other of these heads. I shall therefore not attempt
to carry the distinction through. But so far as we can
theoretically draw a line of demarcation between them,
it appears to be probable that the magical is older than
the inspired type. For a consideration both of abstract
probability and of the concrete facts points strongly to the conclusion that a belief in magic is older than a
belief in gods. On the particular grounds for that conclusion I do not propose to dwell ; an examination
of them would lead us too far from our subject. But
if it be true that in the evolution of society magic has
preceded religion, it becomes probable that magicians
may in some cases have gradually developed into kings before it occurred to people to imagine that their rulers
were the living incarnations of great spirits or deities.



36 INFLUENCE OF SUPERSTITION LECT.
However, for our immediate purpose the question of
the priority of the two types is of little moment, and I
shall pass it by. What is essential to the understanding
of the character of kings in early society is some
acquaintance with the principles of primitive magic, and some notion of the extraordinary hold which that
ancient system of superstition has had on the human
mind in all ages and in all countries. For whatever
else he may have been, the old king seems commonly
to have been a magician.
The idea that the first king was simply the strongest
and bravest man of his tribe is one of those facile
theories which the arm-chair philosopher concocts with
his feet on the fender without taking the trouble to
consult the facts. Like many other speculations of
that sort it seems so obvious, so consonant to reason,
that it must be true, and that to seek to establish it by
actual instances would be superfluous. That such
instances may occur, I would not deny ; but I believe
that, if we could scrutinise the whole evidence, they
would be found to be the exceptions rather than the
rule. All purely rationalistic speculations of this sort
as to the origin of society are vitiated by one funda
mental defect : they do not reckon with the influence
of superstition, which pervades the life of the savage and has contributed to build up the social organism to
an incalculable extent. We are only beginning dimly
to apprehend how many institutions of universal pre
valence, not limited to one race or one religion, may
perhaps rest historically on a foundation of savage



ii PRINCIPLES OF MAGIC 37
superstition, that is, on ideas which would now only
need to be stated in order to be immediately rejected
as false and absurd by every reasonable and educated
man, whatever his political or religious creed might be.
I say that we are only beginning to apprehend this, for we are only beginning to understand the mind of the
savage, and therefore the mind of our savage fore
fathers who created these institutions and handed them
down to us. If the time should ever come when what
we merely suspect should prove to be true, and the
truth should be recognised by all, it may involve a
reconstruction of society such as we can hardly dream
of. But that is a question for the future, perhaps a
stormy future. Here we are concerned with the peace
ful past. I was led into making these remarks by the observa
tion that it is impossible to understand the rise of the
kingly power without some acquaintance with primitive
superstition, and particularly with that branch of it
which goes by the name of magic. Accordingly I propose now to devote some time to a consideration of
the theory and practice of magic without special refer
ence to the exercise of that art by the early king.
The principles of thought on which magic is based appear to resolve themselves into two : first, that like
produces like, or that an effect resembles its cause ;
and, second, that things which have once been in contact
continue to act on each other even after the contact
has been severed. The former principle may be called
the Law of Similarity, the latter the Law of Contact or



38 KINDS OF MAGIC LECT.
Contagion. From the first of these principles namely, the Law of Similarity the magician infers that he can
produce any effect he desires merely by imitating it : from the second namely, the Law of Contact or
Contagion he concludes that whatever he does to a
material object will affect equally the person with whom
the object was once in contact, whether it formed part
of his body or not. Charms based on the Law of
Similarity may be called Homoeopathic or Imitative Magic. Charms based on the Law of Contact or
Contagion may be called Contagious Magic. The
expression Homoeopathic Magic to designate the former
species was first employed, so far as I am aware, by
Mr. Y. Hirn. 1 It seems to me an excellent expression,
and I prefer it to the phrase Imitative or Mimetic
Magic which, partly following Mr. Sidney Hartland, 2 I
formerly employed to denote the same thing. For Imitative or Mimetic Magic suggests, if it does not
imply, a conscious agent who imitates, and it thereby
limits the scope of magic too narrowly. For the same
principles which the magician applies in the practice of
his art are implicitly believed by him to regulate the
operations of inanimate nature ; in other words, he
tacitly assumes that the Laws of Similarity and Contact
are of universal application and are not limited to
human actions. In short, magic is a spurious system
of natural law as well as a fallacious guide of conduct,
a false science as well as an abortive art. Regarded as

ii KINDS OF MAGIC 39
a system of natural law, that is, as a statement of the
rules which determine the sequence of events through
out the world, it may be called Theoretical Magic :
regarded as a set of precepts which human beings observe in order to compass their ends, it may be
called Practical Magic.
I shall return to this distinction later on. Here
what I wish to impress on you is not so much the
difference between the theory and the practice of magic
as the distinction between the principles of thought that
respectively underlie the two branches of magic which
I have called Homoeopathic and Contagious. Both
principles turn out on analysis to be merely two
different misapplications of the association of ideas.
Homoeopathic magic is founded on the association of
ideas by similarity : contagious magic is founded on
the association of ideas by contiguity. Homoeopathic magic commits the mistake of assuming that things
which resemble each other are the same : contagious
magic commits the mistake of assuming that things
which have once been in contact with each other are
always in contact. But in practice the two branches
of magic are often combined ; or, to be more exact,
while homoeopathic or imitative magic may be
practised by itself, contagious magic will generally
be found to involve an application of the homoeopathic
or imitative principle. Thus abstractly stated, the two
things may be a little difficult to grasp. You will
readily understand them when they are illustrated by
concrete examples. Both trains of thought are in fact



40 HOMCEOPATHIC MAGIC LECT.
extremely simple and elementary. It could hardly be
otherwise, since they are familiar in the concrete,
though certainly not in the abstract, to the crude
intelligence not only of the savage, but of ignorant and dull-witted people everywhere. Both branches of
magic, the homoeopathic and the contagious, may
conveniently be comprehended under the general name
of Sympathetic Magic, since both assume that things act on each other at a distance through a secret
sympathy, the impulse being transmitted from the
one to the other by means of what we may conceive
as a sort of invisible ether, not unlike that which, I
understand, is postulated by modern science for a pre
cisely similar purpose namely, to explain how things
can physically affect each other through a space which
appears to be empty.
All this will, I hope, be made plain to you by the
examples with which I will now illustrate both branches
of magic, beginning with the homoeopathic. But here it may be convenient to tabulate as follows the branches
of magic according to the laws of thought which underlie them :

that like produces like is the attempt which has been
made in many ages and in almost all parts of the world
to injure or destroy an enemy by injuring or destroying an effigy of him, in the belief that just as the effigy
suffers so does the man, and that when it perishes he
must die. Thus the North American Indians believe
that by drawing the figure of a person in sand, ashes,
or clay, or by considering any object as his body, and
then stabbing it with a sharp stick or doing it any other
injury, they inflict a corresponding injury on the person
represented. 1 Among the Chippeway Indians, when a man was ill he used to ask the sorcerer to transfer the
disease to some other person to whom he bore a grudge.
To effect this, the sorcerer made a small wooden image
of the patient's enemy, pierced the heart of the image, and introduced various magical powders into it, while he
muttered an appropriate spell.
2 So when a Cora Indian
of Mexico wishes to kill a man, he makes a figure of him
out of burnt clay, strips of cloth, and so forth, and then,
uttering incantations, runs thorns through the head or
stomach of the figure to make his victim suffer in the
corresponding part of his body. Sometimes the Cora Indian makes a more beneficent use of this sort of
homoeopathic magic. When he wishes to multiply his flocks or herds, he makes a figure of the animal he
wants in wax or clay, and deposits it in a cave of the
mountains ; for these Indians believe that the mountains

are masters of all riches, including cattle and sheep.
For every cow, deer, dog, or hen he wants, the Indian
has to sacrifice a corresponding image of the creature. 1
This may help us to understand the meaning of the
figures of cattle, deer, horses, and pigs which were
dedicated to Diana at Nemi. They may have been
the offerings of farmers or huntsmen who hoped thereby
to multiply the cattle or the game. The Peruvian
Indians moulded images of fat mixed with grain to
imitate the persons whom they disliked or feared, and
then burned the effigy on the road where the intended
victim was to pass. This they called burning his soul.
But they drew a delicate distinction between the kinds
of ^materials to be used in the manufacture of these
images, according as the intended victim was an Indian
or a Viracocha, that is, a Spaniard. To kill an Indian
they employed maize and the fat of a llama, to kill a
Spaniard they used wheat and the fat of a pig, because
Viracochas did not eat llamas, and preferred wheat to
maize. 2
I may observe in passing that the meaning and origin
of the name Viracocha, as applied by the Peruvian
Indians to the Spaniards, is explained with great frank
ness by an early Italian (not, you will observe, a Spanish)
historian of America, who had himself travelled in the
country at the time of the Conquest. He says : " When
the Indians saw the very great cruelties which the
Spaniards committed everywhere on entering Peru, not

only would they never believe us to be Christians and
children of God, as boasted, but not even that we were
born on this earth, or generated by a man and born of
a woman ; so fierce an animal they concluded must be
the offspring of the sea, and therefore they called us
Viracocchie^ for in their language they call the sea cocchie
and the froth vira ; thus they think that we are a
congelation of the sea, and have been nourished by the
froth ; and that we are come to destroy the world, with
other things in which the Omnipotence of God would not
suffice to undeceive them. They say that the winds
ruin houses and break down trees, and the fire burns
them ; but the Viracocchie devour everything, they
consume the very earth, they force the rivers, they are
never quiet, they never rest, they are always rushing about, sometimes in one direction and sometimes in the
other, seeking for gold and silver ; yet never contented,
they game it away, they make war, they kill each other,
they rob, they swear, they are renegades, they never
speak the truth, and they deprive us of our support. Finally, the Indians curse the sea for having cast such
very wicked and harsh beings on the land." 1 An
explanation of the name Viracocha, much more flatter
ing to Spanish vanity, is given by the Inca Garcilasso de la Vega, himself half a Spaniard.2 But to return to
our magic. When the Lerons of Borneo wish to be revenged on

an enemy they make a wooden image of him and leave
it in the jungle. As it decays he dies. 1 More elaborate
is the proceeding adopted by the Kenyahs of Borneo in similar circumstances. The operator retires with the
image to a quiet spot on the river bank, and when a hawk
appears in a certain part of the sky he kills a fowl,
smears its blood on the image, and puts a bit of fat in
the mouth of the figure, saying, " Put fat in his mouth."
By that he means, " May his head be cut off, hung up
in an enemy's house, and fed with fat in the usual way."
Then he strikes at the breast of the image with a small
wooden spear, throws it into a pool of water reddened
with red earth, and afterwards takes it out and buries it
in the ground. 2 If an Aino of Japan wishes to compass
the destruction of an enemy, he will make a likeness
of him out of mugwort or the guelder-rose and bury it in a hole upside down or under the trunk of a rotten
tree, with a prayer to a demon to carry off the man's
soul or to make his body rot away with the tree.
Sometimes an Aino woman will attempt to get rid of
her husband in this fashion by wrapping up his head
dress in the shape of a corpse and burying it deep in the ground, while she breathes a prayer that her husband
may rot and die with the head-dress. 3
Often, however, magical images are employed for more amiable purposes. Thus to shoot an arrow into

the heart of a clay image was an ancient Hindoo mode
of winning a woman's love ; only the bow-string must
be of hemp, the shaft of the arrow must be of black ala
wood, its plume an owl's feather, and its barb a thorn. 1
No doubt the wound inflicted on the heart of the clay
image was supposed to make a corresponding impression on the woman's heart. Among the Chippeway Indians,
we are told, there used to be few young men or women
who had not little images of the persons whose love
they wished to win. They punctured the hearts of the
images and inserted magical powders in the punctures, while they addressed the images by the names of the
persons whom they represented, bidding them requite their affection. 2 And as the wound of love may be
inflicted by means of an image, so by means of an image
it may be healed. How that can be done has been
described by Heine in a poem based on the experi
ence of one of his own schoolfellows. It is
called The Pilgrimage to Krvlaar, and tells how sick
people are wont to offer wax models of their ailing
members to the Virgin Mary at Kevlaar in order that
she may heal them of their infirmities. In Heine's
poem a young man lies wasting away for love and sorrow at the death of his sweetheart. So he goes with
his mother on pilgrimage to the Virgin at Kevlaar, and
offers her the waxen model of a heart, with a prayer
that she would be pleased to heal his own wounded

heart. Such customs, still commonly observed in some
parts of Europe, are interesting because they show how
in later times magic comes to be incorporated with
religion. The moulding of wax images of ailing
members is in its origin purely magical : the prayer to
the Virgin or to a saint is purely religious : the com
bination of the two is a crude, if pathetic, attempt to
turn both magic and religion to account for the benefit
of the sufferer.
The natives of New Caledonia make use of effigies
to maintain or restore harmony between husband and
wife. Two spindle-shaped bundles, one representing the man and the other the woman, are tied firmly
together to symbolise and ensure the amity of the
couple. They are made up of various plants, together with some threads from the woman's girdle and a piece
of the man's apron ; a bone needle forms the axis of
each. The talisman is meant to render the union of
the spouses indissoluble, and is carefully treasured by
them both. If, nevertheless, a domestic jar should
unfortunately take place, the husband repairs to the
family burying-ground with the precious packet. There
he lights a fire with a wood of a particular kind, fumi
gates the talisman, sprinkles it with water from a pre
scribed source, waves it round his head, and then stirring
the needle in the bundle which represents himself, he
says, " I change the heart of this woman that she may
love me." If the wife still remains obdurate, he ties a
sugar-cane to the bundle, and presents it to her through a third person. If she eats of the sugar-cane, she feels

her love for her husband revive. On her side she has
the right to operate in like manner on the bundle which
represents herself in order to recover her husband's
affection. 1
Another beneficent use of homoeopathic magic is to
heal or prevent sickness. In ancient Greece, when a
man died of dropsy, his children were made to sit with
their feet in water until the body was burned. This
was supposed to prevent the watery disease from attack
ing them. 2
Similarly, on the principle of water to water,
among the natives of the hills near Rajamahall in India,
the body of a person who has died of dropsy is thrown
into a river : they think that if the corpse were buried,
the disorder would return and carry off other people.8
The ancient Hindoos performed an elaborate cere
mony, based on homoeopathic magic, for the cure of jaundice. Its main drift was to banish the yellow
colour to yellow creatures and yellow things, such as
the sun, to which it properly belongs, and to procure
for the patient a healthy red colour from a living,
vigorous source, namely a red bull. With this inten
tion, a priest recited the following spell : " Up to the
sun shall go thy heart-ache and thy jaundice : in the
colour of the red bull do we envelop thee ! We
envelop thee in red tints, unto long life. May this
person go unscathed and be free of yellow colour !

The cows whose divinity is Rohini, they who, more
over, are themselves red (rohinih) in their every form
and every strength we do envelop thee. Into the
parrots, into the thrush, do we put thy jaundice, and,
furthermore, into the yellow wagtail do we put thy
jaundice." While he uttered these words, the priest,
in order to infuse the rosy hue of health into the sallow
patient, gave him water to sip which was mixed with
the hair of a red bull : he poured water over the
animal's back and made the sick man drink it : he
seated him on the skin of a red bull and tied a piece of
the skin to him. Then in order to improve his colour
by thoroughly eradicating the yellow taint, he proceeded thus. He first daubed him from head to foot with a
yellow porridge made of turmeric or curcuma (a yellow
plant), set him on a bed, tied three yellow birds, to wit,
a parrot, a thrush, and a yellow wagtail, by means of a yellow string to the foot of the bed ; then pouring water
over the patient, he washed off the yellow porridge, and
with it no doubt the jaundice, from him to the yellow
birds. After that, by way of giving a final bloom to
his complexion, he took some hairs of a red bull, wrapt
them in gold leaf, and glued them to the patient's skin. 1
The ancient Greeks held that if a person suffering from
jaundice looked sharply at a stone-curlew, and the bird
looked steadily at him, he was cured of the disease.

temperament of the creature that it draws out and

receives the malady which issues, like a stream, through
the eyesight."
l So well recognised among bird-fanciers
was this valuable property of the stone-curlew that when
they had one of these birds for sale they kept it carefully
covered, lest a jaundiced person should look at it and
be cured for nothing. 2 The virtue of the bird lay not
in the drab colour of its plumage but in its large golden
eye, which, if it is not mistaken for a tuft of yellow
lichen, is the first thing that strikes the searcher, as the
bird cowers, to escape observation, on the ground. 8
Thus the yellow eye of the bird drew out the yellow
jaundice. Pliny tells of another, or perhaps the same,
bird, to which the Greeks gave their name for jaundice,
because if a jaundiced man saw it the disease left him
and slew the bird. 4 He mentions also a stone which
was supposed to cure jaundice because its hue resembled
that of a jaundiced skin. 5 In Germany yellow turnips,
gold coins, gold rings, saffron, and other yellow things are still esteemed remedies for jaundice, just as a stick
of red sealing-wax carried on the person cures the red
eruption popularly known as St. Anthony's fire, or the blood-stone with its blood-red spots allays bleeding.*
Another cure prescribed in Germany for St. Anthony's
fire is to rub the patient with ashes from a house that

An ancient Indian cure for a scanty crop of hair, based
on the same principle, was to pour a solution of certain
plants over the head of the patient ; this had to be done
by a doctor who was dressed in black and had eaten
black food, and the ceremony must be performed in
the early morning, while the stars were fading in the
sky, and before the black crows had risen cawing from
their nests. 2 The exact virtue of these plants has
unfortunately escaped our knowledge, but we can hardly doubt that they were dark and hairy ; while the
black clothes of the doctor, his black food, and the
swarthy hue of the crows unquestionably combined to
produce a crop of black hair on the patient's head. A
more disagreeable means of attaining the same end is
adopted by some of the tribes of Central Australia. To
promote the growth of a boy's hair a man with flowing
locks bites the youth's scalp as hard as he can, being
urged thereto by his friends, who sit round watching
him at his task, while the sufferer howls aloud with
pain.

if I may say so, he thus imparts of his own mature
abundance to the scarcity of his youthful friend.
One of the great merits of homoeopathic magic is that
it enables the cure to be performed on the person of the
doctor instead of on that of his victim, who is thus
relieved of all trouble and inconvenience, while he sees
his medical man writhe in anguish before him. For
example, the peasants of Perche, in France, labour under
the impression that a prolonged fit of vomiting is
brought about by the patient's stomach becoming
unhooked, as they call it, and so falling down. Accord
ingly, a practitioner is called in to restore the organ to
its proper place. After hearing the symptoms he at once throws himself into the most horrible contortions,
for the purpose of unhooking his own stomach. Having
succeeded in the effort, he next hooks it up again in
another series of contortions and grimaces, while the
patient experiences a corresponding relief. Fee five francs. 1
Further, great use is made of homoeopathic and in
general sympathetic magic for the sake of procuring a plentiful supply of food. The hunter and the fisherman
resort to it for this purpose, whether their immediate
object is to multiply the game and the fish, or to lure
the wild creatures to their destruction. The farmer
also employs it in order to cause his crops and fruits
to ripen.
Thus to begin with hunting and fishing, the Toradjas of Central Celebes believe that things of the

same sort attract each other by means of their indwell
ing spirits or vital ether. Hence they hang up the
jawbones of deer and wild pigs in their houses, in
order that the spirits which animate these bones may
draw the living creatures of the same kind into the
path of the hunter. 1 The western tribes of British
New Guinea employ a charm to aid the hunter in
spearing dugong or turtle. A small beetle, which
haunts cocoa-nut trees, is placed in the socket of the
spear-haft into which the spear- head fits. This is
supposed to make the spear -head stick fast in the
dugong or turtle, just as the beetle sticks fast to a
man's skin when it bites him. 2
But the system of sympathetic magic is not merely
composed of positive precepts ; it comprises a very
large number of negative precepts, that is, prohibitions. It tells you not merely what to do, but also what to
leave undone. The positive precepts are charms : the
negative precepts are taboos. The whole doctrine of
taboo, in fact, would seem to be only a special applica
tion of sympathetic magic, with its two great laws of
similarity and contact. Though these laws are certainly not formulated in so many words by the savage, they
are nevertheless implicitly believed by him to regulate
the course of nature quite independently of human will.
He thinks that if he acts in a certain way, certain conse
quences will inevitably follow in virtue of one or other of

ii NATURE OF TABOO 53
these laws ; and if the consequences of a particular act
appear to him likely to prove disagreeable or dangerous, he is naturally careful not to act in that way in order
not to incur those consequences. In other words, he
abstains from doing that which, in accordance with his
mistaken notions of cause and effect, he falsely believes
would injure him ; in short, he subjects himself to a
taboo. Thus taboo is only a negative application of
practical magic. Positive magic, or sorcery, says, " Do this, in order that so and so may happen."
Negative magic or taboo says, " Do not do this, lest
so and so should happen/' Sorcery says, "Act." Taboo says, "Abstain." The aim of positive magic,
that is, of sorcery, is to produce a desired event : the
aim of negative magic, that is, of taboo, is to avoid
an undesirable one. But both consequences, the desir
able and the undesirable, are supposed to be brought
about by the same natural agencies, to wit, the law
of similarity and the law of contact. And just as the
desired consequence is not really effected by the
observance of a magical ceremony, so the dreaded
consequence does not really result from the violation
of a taboo. If the supposed evil necessarily followed a
breach of taboo, the taboo would not be a taboo but
a precept of morality or common sense. It is not a
taboo to say, " Do not put your hand in the fire "
;
it is a rule of common sense, because the forbidden
action entails a real, not an imaginary evil. In short,
those negative precepts which we call taboo are just as
vain and futile as those positive precepts which we call



54 SORCERT AND TABOO LECT.
sorcery. The two things are merely opposite sides or poles of one great disastrous fallacy, a mistaken
conception of the nature of the association of ideas.
Of that fallacy, sorcery is the positive, and taboo the
negative pole. If we give the general name of magic to the whole erroneous system, both theoretical and
practical, then taboo may be defined as the negative
side of practical magic. To put this in a tabular
form :

I have made these remarks on taboo and its relation
to magic a relation which has not yet, I think, been
generally apprehended because I am about to give some instances of taboos observed by hunters and
fishermen, and I wished to show that they fall under
the head of Sympathetic Magic, being only particular
applications of that general theory. Among the Esquimaux of Baffin Land boys are
forbidden to play at cat's cradle, because if they did
so their fingers might in later life become entangled
in the harpoon - line. 1 Here, as you will readily
perceive, the taboo is obviously an application of
1 F. Boas, "The Eskimo of Baffin Land and Hudson Bay," Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural Historv, xv. Part i. (1901), p. 161.



ii HOMCEOPATHIC TABOOS 55
the law of similarity which is the basis of homoeo
pathic magic : as the child's fingers are entangled by
the string in playing cat's cradle, so they will be
entangled by the harpoon-line when he is a man and hunts whales. Again, among the Huzuls of the
Carpathian Mountains, the wife of a hunter may not
spin while her husband is eating ; for if she does, the
game will turn and wind like the spindle, and the
hunter will not be able to hit it. 1 Here again the
taboo is clearly derived from the law of similarity.
This Huzul superstition perhaps enables us to under
stand a curious law of ancient Italy mentioned by
Pliny, which forbade women to spin on the high-roads
as they walked, or even to carry their spindles openly, because any such action was believed to injure the
crops.
1 Probably the notion was that the women
walking on the high-road would pass fields of corn, and
that the twirling of the spindle would twirl the corn
stalks and prevent them from growing straight. To take another example of a taboo based on the law of
similarity, that is, on homoeopathic magic. Camphor is found in the form of crystals in the crevices of
certain trees in the East Indies. Accordingly, in
Borneo, when men are searching for camphor, they may not wash the leaves which they use as plates, lest
the camphor should dissolve and disappear from the
tree.* They think, in fact, that to wash their plates

would be to wash out the camphor crystals from the
trees in which they are imbedded. Again, the chief
product of some parts of Laos, a province of Siam, is lac. This is a resinous gum exuded by a red insect on
the young branches of trees, to which the little
creatures have to be attached by hand. All who
engage in the business of gathering the gum abstain
from washing themselves and especially from cleansing
their heads, lest by removing the parasites from their
hair they should detach the other insects from the
boughs. 1 All these may be called homoeopathic taboos. Further, some of the Brazilian Indians would
never bring a slaughtered deer into their hut with
out first hamstringing it ; for they believed that if
they did not hamstring it, they and their children
would never be able to run down their enemies. 2
Apparently they thought that by hamstringing the animal they at the same stroke deprived their foes of
the use of their legs. Once more, the Cholones, an
Indian tribe of Eastern Peru, employ poisoned arrows
in the chase ; but there are certain animals, such as
armadillos, certain kinds of falcons, and a species of
vulture, which they would on no account shoot at with
these weapons. For they believe that between the
poisoned arrows which they use and the supply of
poison at home there exists a sympathetic relation of

ii CONTAGIOUS TABOOS 57
such a sort that if they shot at any of these creatures
with poisoned shafts all the poison at home would be
spoilt, which would be a great loss to them. 1 Here
the exact train of thought is not clear ; but we may
suppose that the animals in question are believed to
possess a power of counteracting and annulling the effect of the poison, and that consequently if they are touched
by it, all the poison, including the store of it at home,
would be deprived of its virtue. However that may
be, it is plain that the superstition rests on the law
of contact, on the idea, namely, that things which
have once been in contact with each other remain so
sympathetically always. The poison with which the hunter wounds an animal has once been in contact
with the store of poison at home ; hence if the poison
in the wound loses its venom, so necessarily will all the
poison at home. These may be called contagious taboos.
This belief of the Cholones Indians, in the sympa
thetic influence exerted on each other by things at a
distance, is of the essence of magic. Whatever doubts
science may entertain as to the possibility of action at
a distance, magic has none ; faith in telepathy is one of
its first principles. A modern advocate of the influence
of mind upon mind at a distance would have no diffi
culty in convincing a savage ; the savage believed in it
long ago, and what is more, he acted on his belief with
a logical consistency such as his civilised brother in the
faith has not yet, so far as I am aware, exhibited in his
1 E. Poepptg, Rene in Chilt, Peru tatd auf dtm Am4*murm* (Leiptic, 1835-36), i. 323.



58 SAVAGE TELEPATHY LECT.
conduct. For the savage is convinced not only that
magical ceremonies affect persons and things afar off,
but that the simplest acts of daily life may in certain
circumstances do so also. Hence on momentous occa
sions the conduct of friends and relations at a distance
is often regulated by a more or less elaborate code of
rules, the neglect of which by the one set of persons
would, it is supposed, entail misfortune or even death
on their distant friends. Thus, for example, when a
party of men are out hunting or fighting, their rela
tions at home are often expected to do certain things,
or to abstain from doing certain others, for the sake of
ensuring the safety and success of the absent hunters or
warriors. How the particular acts or abstinences are
supposed to operate is not always plain ; what is clear is that they are really believed to affect the distant
persons for good or evil. Thus to take a few instances. When some of the
Central Esquimaux are away hunting on the ice, it is
forbidden to lift up the bedding at home ; because they
think that to do so would cause the ice to crack and
drift off, and so the men might be lost. 1 The notion
seems to be that the lifting of the men's bedclothes
would cause the ice on which they are standing to lift
also ; and a skater knows that the undulation of the
ice is always a sign that it is thin and may give way
with him. Again, among the Esquimaux in the winter, when the new moon appears, boys must run

ii SAVAGE TELEPATHY 59
out of the snow-house, take a handful of snow, and
put it into the kettle. It is believed that this helps the
hunter to capture the seal and to bring it home. 1 Here
the putting of snow in the kettle is probably regarded
as a preparation for boiling something in it : it is an imitation of what will happen when the hunter comes
home with his bag, and thus it helps by means of
imitative magic to bring about that desired result.
Lastly, in the Baram district of Sarawak, when the
men are away searching for camphor in the forest, the
women at home dare not touch a comb ; for if they
did so, the interstices between the fibres of the tree,
instead of being filled with the precious camphor
crystals, would be empty, like the spaces between the
teeth of a comb. 2 This is plainly an application of
the law of similarity ; in other words, it is a case of
homoeopathic magic.
These examples may serve to illustrate the savage
theory of telepathy, that is, the belief in a magical sympathy which binds together friends at a distance so
that their actions mutually affect each other for good
or ill. And in regard to negative magic or taboo the
foregoing instances have shown that it, like positive
magic or sorcery, falls into two great divisions, which
may be called respectively Homoeopathic Taboo and
Contagious Taboo, according as they are based on the law of similarity or the law of contact.

that hurt him Magical contact of footprints Public magicians develop into kings Rise of monarchy essential to the emer
gence of mankind from savagery.
IN the last lecture I explained the two great principles
of magic, which may be called the Law of Similarity and
the Law of Contact. The law of similarity is the
foundation of homoeopathic or imitative magic. The
law of contact is the foundation of contagious magic.
Both branches of magic assume the possibility of acting
on persons and things at a distance. At the end of last
lecture I illustrated this primitive belief in telepathy by the
rules observed by people at home while their friends are
away hunting or searching for precious commodities, such as camphor. Rules of the same sort, based on a belief in
the sympathetic connection between persons at a dis
tance, are observed by friends and relations at home
while the men are out on the warpath. Thus among
the Toradjas of Central Celebes, when a party is away
hunting for heads, the villagers who stay at home, and 60



L ECT. 1 1 1 TELEPATHY IN WAR 6 1
especially the wives of the head-hunters, have to observe
certain rules in order not to hinder the absent men at
their task. In the first place the entrance to the lobo
or spirit-house is shut. For the spirits of their fathers,
who live in that house, are now away with the warriors,
watching over and guarding them ; and if any one
entered their house in their absence, the spirits would
hear the noise and return in great anger at thus being
recalled from the campaign. Moreover, the people at
home have to keep the house tidy : the sleeping-mats
of the absent men must be hung on beams, not rolled
up as if they were to be away for a long time : their
wives and next-of-kin may not quit the house at night :
every night a light burns in the house, and a fire must
be kept up constantly at the foot of the house-ladder :
garments, turbans, and head-dresses may not be laid
aside, for if the turban or head-dress were put off by
friends at home, the warrior's turban might drop from
his head in the battle. When the spirit of the head
hunter returns home in his sleep (which is the Toradja's
expression for a soldier's dream) he must find every
thing there in good order and nothing that could vex
him. By the observance of these rules, say the
Toradjas, the souls of the head-hunters are covered or
protected. And in order to make them strong, that
they may not soon grow weary, rice is strewed morning
and evening on the floor of the house, probably in order
to feed and refresh the absent warriors. The women
too go about constantly with a certain plant of which
the pods are so light and feathery that they are easily

wafted by the wind, for that helps to make the men
nimble-footed. 1 This last custom, as well as the rule
as to the wearing of turbans, are clearly applications of
the law of similarity. Among the Shans of Burma the wife of an absent
warrior has to observe certain rules. Every fifth day
she rests and does no work. She fills an earthen goblet
with water to the brim and puts flowers into it every
day. If the water sinks, or the flowers fade, it is an
omen of death. Moreover, she may not sleep in her
husband's bed during his absence, but she sweeps the
bedding clean and lays it out every night,
2 perhaps in order that her husband's soul may repose on it if he
should revisit his home in a dream, like the war-broken
soldier in Campbell's poem
Our bugles sang truce, for the night-cloud had lowered, And the sentinel stars set their watch in the sky.
While marriageable boys of the Mekeo district in
British New Guinea are making their drums, they have
to live alone in the forest and observe a number of rules
which are based on the law of similarity, that is, on
the principle of homoeopathic magic. The drums will be used in the dances, and in order that they may give
out a resonant sonorous note, great care must be taken
in their construction. Having chosen a suitable piece
of wood, the lad hollows out the inside by burning it
with a hot coal till the sides are very thin. The skin

of an iguana is then stretched over the hollow and
tightened with string and glue. All the time the boy is at work on the drum, he may not eat fish ; for if a
fish bone pricked him, the skin of the drum would
burst. If he ate a red banana, it would choke him, and
the drum would consequently have a dull stifled note :
if he tasted grated cocoa-nut, the white ants, like the
white particles of the nut, would gnaw the body of the
drum : if he touched water, the hot coal with which he
burns out the inside of the drum would be extinguished :
if he cooked his food in an ordinary round pot, he
himself would grow fat and round like a pot, and the
girls would jeer at him. 1 Again, a Highland witch
can sink a ship by homoeopathic magic. She has only to set a small round dish floating in a milk-pan
full of water, and then to croon her spell. When the
dish upsets in the pan, the ship will go down in the
sea. They say that once three witches from Harris
left home at night, after placing the milk-pan thus on
the floor, and strictly charging a serving-maid to let
nothing come near it. But while the girl was not
looking, a duck waddled into the room and squattered
in the water of the pan. Next morning the witches
came home and asked if anything had come near the
pan. The girl said " No/* whereupon one of the
witches remarked, " What a heavy sea we had last
night coming round Cabag Head !

has carried off a sheep, the Esthonians know a very
simple way of making him drop it. They let
fall anything they happen to have at hand, such
as a cap or a glove, or they lift up a heavy stone and let it go.
1 On the principle of homoeopathic
magic, that clearly compels the wolf to let go the
sheep.
In the last lecture I mentioned that homoeopathic
magic is often employed to make plants grow and bear
fruit. Thus among the Huzuls of the Carpathians,
when a woman is planting cabbages, she winds many cloths about her head, in order that the heads of the
cabbages may also be thick. 2 Among the Kurs of East
Prussia, when a farmer sows his fields in spring, he
carries an axe and chops the earth with it, in order that
the corn-stalks may be so sturdy that an axe will be
needed to hew them down.3 When Macedonian
farmers have done digging their fields, they throw their
spades up into the air, and catching them again, exclaim,
" May the crop grow as high as the spade has gone !
"4
And as plants may be helped, so they may be hindered
and marred by homoeopathic magic. The eminent novelist, Mr. Thomas Hardy, was once informed that
the reason why certain trees in front of his house, near
Dorchester, did not thrive, was that he looked at them
before breakfast on an empty stomach. Mr. Hardy

told me this himself. 1 You will easily perceive that the
effect of an empty stomach, conveyed through the eye
sight, must necessarily be prejudicial to trees by emptying them, so to say, of sap and nutriment. Thus
stated the principle seems almost a truism.
In these examples people are supposed to influence
plants for good or evil by means of homceopathic
magic. But on the same principle plants can recipro
cally influence people. In magic, as I believe in physics, action and reaction are equal and opposite. The
Cherokee Indians are adepts in practical botany of this
sort. Thus the wiry roots of the catgut plant or devil's
shoestring (Tephrosia) are so tough that they can almost stop a ploughshare in the furrow. Hence Cherokee
women wash their heads with a decoction of the roots
to make the hair strong, and Cherokee ball-players wash
themselves with it to toughen their muscles. Again,
to help them to spring quickly to their feet when they
are thrown to the ground, these Indian ball-players
bathe their limbs with a decoction of the small rush
(Juncus tcnuis\ because, so they say, that plant always recovers its erect position, no matter how often it has
been trampled down. To improve a child's memory the Cherokces beat up burs in water which has been
fetched from a roaring waterfall. The virtue of the
potion is threefold. The voice of the Long Man or
river-god is heard in the roar of the cataract : the
stream seizes and holds whatever is cast upon its surface ;
and there is nothing that sticks like a bur. Hence it

seems clear that with the potion the child will drink in
the lessons taught by the voice of the waters, will seize
upon them like the stream, and will stick fast to them
like a bur. 1
The Sundanese of the Indian Archipelago regard
certain kinds of wood as unsuitable for use in house
building, especially such trees as have thorns on them.
They think that the life of people who lived in a house
made of such timber would be thorny and full of
trouble. If a house were built of trees that had fallen
or lost their leaves through age, the inmates would die
soon ; if it were built of wood taken from a house that
had been burnt down, fire would be sure to break out
in the new dwelling.
2 Before the Cherokee braves
went forth to war, the medicine-man used to give each
of them a small charmed root which made him abso
lutely invulnerable. On the eve of battle the warrior
bathed in a running stream, chewed a portion of the
root and spat the juice on his body in order that the
bullets might slide from his skin like the drops of
water. Some of you may perhaps doubt whether this
really made the men bullet-proof. There is a barren and
paralysing spirit of scepticism abroad at the present day
which is most deplorable. However, the efficacy of this
particular charm was proved in the American Civil War ;
for three hundred Cherokees served in the army of the

South, and they were never, or hardly ever, wounded
in action. 1
Homoeopathic magic often works by means of the
dead ; for just as the dead can neither see nor hear nor
speak, so you can render people temporarily blind, deaf, and dumb by means of dead men's bones or any
thing else that is infected with the contagion of death.
Burglars in all ages and in many lands have been
patrons of this species of magic. In ancient Greece
the housebreaker thought he could silence the fiercest
watch-dog by means of a brand plucked from a funeral
pyre.
2 To throw the inmates of a house into deep
slumber, the Peruvian Indian scatters the dust of dead
men's bones.3 The Indians of Mexico employed for
this purpose the left forearm of a dead woman ; but
the bone had to be stolen. With this they beat on the
ground before they entered the house which they in
tended to rob ; that made the inmates to lose all
power of speech and motion ; they were as dead, hear
ing and seeing everything, but powerless to stir. 4 In Europe similar properties were ascribed to the Hand
of Glory, which was the dried and pickled hand of a
man who had been hanged. If a candle made of the
fat of a malefactor who had also died on the gallows
was lighted and placed in the Hand of Glory as in a

candlestick, it rendered motionless all persons to whom
it was presented ; they could not stir a finger any more
than if they were dead. 1 Sometimes the dead man's
hand is itself the candle, or rather bunch of candles,
all its withered fingers being set on fire ; but should
one member of the household be awake, one finger of
the hand will not kindle. 2 When a Blackfoot Indian
went out eagle-hunting, he used to take a skull with
him, because he believed that the skull would make
him invisible like the dead man to whom it had be
longed. Thus the eagles would not be able to see and
attack him.3 The Tarahumares of Mexico are great
runners, and parties of them engage in races with each
other. They believe that the bones of the dead induce
fatigue ; hence before a race the friends of one side
will bury dead men's bones in the track, hoping that
the runners of the other side will pass over them and
so be weakened. Naturally they warn their own men
to shun the spot where the bones are buried. 4 The
Belep tribe of New Caledonia think they can disable
an enemy from flight by means of the leg-bone of a
dead foe. They stick certain plants into the bone, and
then smash it between stones before the skulls of their
ancestors. It is easy to see that this breaks the leg of
the living enemy and so hinders him from running away. 5

in MAGIC OF ANIMALS 69
Again, many animals are conceived to possess pro
perties which might be useful to man, and accordingly the savage seeks to transfer them to himself by means
of homoeopathic magic. Thus when a Galla of East
Africa sees a tortoise, he will take off his sandals and
step on it, believing that this makes the soles of his feet
hard like the shell -of the animal. 1 The Esquimaux of
Baffin Land think that if part of the intestines of a fox
is placed under the feet of a baby boy, he will become
active and skilful in walking over thin ice, like a fox. 2
The ancient Greeks were of opinion that to eat the
flesh of the wakeful nightingale would prevent a man
from sleeping ; that to smear the eyes of a blear-sighted person with the gall of an eagle would give him the
eagle's vision ; and that a raven's eggs would restore
the blackness of the raven to silvery hair. Only, the
person who adopted this last mode of concealing the ravages of time had to be most careful to keep his
mouth full of oil all the time he applied the raven's
eggs to his venerable locks, else his teeth as well as his
hair would be dyed raven black, and no amount of
scrubbing and scouring would avail to whiten them
again.
8 The hair-restorer was in fact a shade too
powerful, and in applying it you might get more than
you bargained for. The Huichol Indians of Mexico admire the beautiful

markings on the backs of serpents. Hence when a
Huichol woman is about to weave or embroider, her
husband catches a large serpent and holds it in a cleft
stick, while the woman strokes the reptile with one
hand down the whole length of its back ; then she
passes the same hand over her forehead and eyes, that
she may be able to work as beautiful patterns in the
web as the markings on the serpent's back. 1 Among the Tarahumares of Mexico men who run races tie
deer-hoofs to their backs in the belief that this will
make them swift - footed like the deer. 2 Cherokee
ball-players rub their bodies with eel-skins in order to
make themselves as slippery and hard to hold as eels ;
and they also apply land-tortoises to their legs in the
hope of making them as thick and strong as the legs of
these animals. But they are careful not to eat frogs,
lest the brittleness of the frog's bones should infect their
own bones. They will not wear the feathers of the bald
headed buzzard for fear of themselves becoming bald, nor
turkey feathers, lest they should suffer from a goitrous
growth on the throat like the red appendage on the
throat of a turkey. 3 Again, the flesh of the common
grey squirrel is forbidden to Cherokees who suffer from
rheumatism, because the squirrel eats in a cramped
position, which would clearly aggravate the pangs of the rheumatic patient.

When a Cherokee is starting on a journey on a cold
winter morning, he rubs his feet in the ashes of the fire
and sings four verses, by means of which he can set the
cold at defiance, like the wolf, the deer, the fox, and
the opossum, whose feet, so the Indians think, are
never frost-bitten. After each verse he imitates the
cry and action of the animal, thus identifying himself
with it by means of homoeopathic magic. The song
he sings may be rendered, " I become a real wolf, a
real deer, a real fox, and a real opossum." After
stating that he has become a real wolf, the songster
utters a prolonged howl and paws the ground like a
wolf with his feet. And similarly he mimics the
other animals. 1 The mole-cricket has claws with which
it burrows, and among the Cherokees it is reputed to
be an excellent singer. Hence when children are long
of learning to speak, their tongues are scratched with
the claw of a live mole-cricket in order that they may
soon talk as distinctly as the insect. Grown persons
also who are slow of speech may acquire a ready flow
of eloquence, if only the inside of their throat be
scratched on four successive mornings with a mole
cricket. 2 The negroes of the Maroni river in Guiana
have a somewhat similar cure for stammering. Day
and night the shrieks of a certain species of ape re
sound through the forest. Hence, when the negroes
kill one of these pests, they remove its larynx and
make a cup out of it. If a stammering child drinks

out of such a cup for a few months, it ceases to
stammer. 1
Cherokee parents scratch the hands of their children
with the pincers of a live red crawfish, resembling a
lobster, in order to give the infants a strong grip, like
that of the crawfish. 2 This may help us to understand
why on the fifth day after birth a Greek child used to
receive presents of octopuses and cuttle-fish from its
friends and relations. 8 For the numerous arms, legs,
and tentacles of these creatures seem well calculated
to strengthen the grip of a baby's hands and to impart
the power of toddling to its little feet.
On the principle of homoeopathic magic inanimate
things as well as plants and animals may be fraught with blessing or bane for mankind ; and the wise man
will extract the one or avoid the other as the case may
be. Out of an infinity of cases I will cite a very few
examples. Thus, on the seventh day after a birth the
Toradjas hold a little feast, at which the feet of the
child are set on a piece of iron, in order to strengthen
its feeble soul with the strong soul of the iron.4 Simi
larly at initiation a Brahman boy is made to tread with
his right foot on a stone, while the words are repeated,
" Tread on this stone ; like a stone be firm." 5 A
Malagese mode of counteracting the levity of fortune is to bury a stone at the foot of the heavy house

post.
1 The common custom of swearing upon a stone
may be based partly on a belief that the strength and
stability of the stone lend confirmation to the oath.
Thus there was a stone at Athens on which the nine
archons stood when they swore to rule justly and
according to the laws. 2 In Laconia an unwrought
stone was shown which, according to the legend,
relieved the matricide Orestes of his madness as soon
as he had sat down on it ;
3 and Zeus is said to have
cured himself of his love for Hera by sitting down
on a certain rock in the island of Leucadia. 4 In these
cases it may have been thought that the wayward and
flighty impulses of love and madness were counteracted
by the steadying influence of a heavy stone.
But magical virtue resides in stones by reason of
their shape and colour as well as of their weight and
solidity. The Indians of Peru employed certain stones
for the increase of maize, others for the increase of
potatoes, and others again for the increase of cattle.
The stones intended to make maize grow were fashioned
in the likeness of cobs of maize, and the stones destined
to multiply cattle had the shape of sheep.

a plantation of taro thrive, they bury in the field
certain stones resembling taros, praying to their
ancestors at the same time. A stone marked with
black lines like the leaves of a cocoa-nut palm helps
to produce a good crop of cocoa-nuts. To make
bread-fruit grow, they use two stones, one small and
one big, representing the unripe and the ripe fruit
respectively. As soon as the fruit begins to form, they
bury the small stone at the foot of the tree ; and later
on, when the fruit approaches maturity, they replace the small stone by the large one. But the staple food
of the New Caledonians is the yam ; hence the number
of stones used to foster the growth of yams is corre
spondingly great. Different families have different
kinds of stones which, according to their diverse shapes
and colours, are supposed to promote the cultivation of
the various species of yams. Before the stones are
buried in the field they are deposited beside the
ancestral skulls, wetted with water, and wiped with
the leaves of certain trees. Sacrifices, too, of yams
and fish are offered to the dead, with the words, " Here
are your offerings, in order that the crop of yams may be good." In these practices of the New Caledonians
the magical efficacy of the stones appears to be deemed
insufficient of itself to accomplish the end in view ; it
has to be reinforced by the spirits of the dead, whose
help is sought by prayer and sacrifice. Thus in New
Caledonia sorcery is blent with the worship of the

dead ; in other words, magic is combined with religion.
If the stones ceased to be employed, and the prayers
and sacrifices to the ancestors remained, the transition
from magic to religion would be complete.
The last example I shall cite of the magical influence
of things is drawn from the ancient ritual books of the
Hindoos, which lay down a rule that after sunset on his
marriage night a man should sit silent with his wife till
the stars begin to twinkle in the sky. When the pole
star appears, he should point it out to her, and,
addressing the star, say, "Firm art thou ; I see thee,
the firm one. Firm be thou with me, O thriving
one !
" Then, turning to his wife, he should say, " To
me Brihaspati has given thee ; obtaining offspring through me, thy husband, live with me a hundred
autumns." The intention of the ceremony is plainly
to guard against the fickleness of fortune and the
instability of earthly bliss by the steadfast influence of
the constant star. It is the wish expressed in Keats's
last sonnet :
Bright star ! would 1 were steadfast as thou art
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night.
Sometimes homoeopathic or imitative magic is called
in to annul an evil omen by accomplishing it in mimicry.
The effect is to circumvent destiny by substituting a
mock calamity for a real one. In Madagascar this
mode of cheating the fates is reduced to a system.

76 FORTUNE OUTWHTED LECT.
Here every man's fortune is determined by the day or
hour of his birth, and if that happens to be an unlucky
one his fate is sealed, unless the mischief can be ex
tracted, as the phrase goes, by means of a substitute.
The ways of extracting the mischief are various. For
example, if a man is born on the first of February, his
house will be burnt down when he comes of age. To
take time by the forelock and prevent this catastrophe,
the friends of the infant will set up a shed in a field
and burn it. To make the ceremony really effective,
the child and his mother should be placed in the shed,
and only plucked, like brands, from the burning hut
before it is too late. Again, dripping November is the
month of tears, and he who is born in it is born to
sorrow. But in order to disperse the clouds that thus
gather over his future, he has nothing to do but to
take the lid off a boiling pot and wave it about. The
drops that fall from the lid will accomplish his destiny
and so prevent the tears from trickling from his eyes.
Again, if fate has decreed that a young girl should
hereafter become a wife and mother, and should see her
children descend before her with sorrow to the grave,
she can avert the calamity as follows. She kills a
grasshopper, wraps it in a rag to represent a shroud, and mourns over it like Rachel weeping for her
children and refusing to be comforted. After burying
the insect, she retires from the grave with the air of a
person plunged in grief. Thenceforth she looks cheer
fully forward to seeing her children survive her ; for it
cannot be that she should mourn and bury them twice

over. Once more, if fortune has frowned on a man at
his birth, and penury has marked him for her own, he
can easily erase the mark in question by purchasing a
couple of cheap pearls, price three half- pence, and burying them. For who but the rich of this world can
thus afford to fling pearls away ? l
Thus far we have been concerned chiefly with the
homoeopathic or imitative branch of magic, which
rests, as I have repeatedly observed, on the law of
similarity. It is time to look for a few minutes at the
other branch of the art namely, Contagious Magic.
The logical, or perhaps I should rather say the illogical, basis of contagious magic is the law of contact ; that
is, the notion that things which have once been con
joined and are afterwards separated remain nevertheless,
however great the distance between them, so united by
a bond of sympathy that whatever is done to the one
affects the other in like manner.
A curious instance of contagious magic is the
belief that between a wounded person and the weapon
which inflicted the wound there exists so close a relation
that whatever is done to the weapon will correspondingly
affect the wounded person for good or evil. Thus in
one of the tribes of South - Eastern Australia it is
thought that if any one but the medicine-man touches
the flint knife with which a certain surgical operation
has been performed on a lad, the lad will thereby be

78 CONTAGIOUS MAGIC LECT.
made very ill. So seriously is this belief held, that if
after the operation the lad should chance to fall sick
and die, the man who touched the knife would be
killed. 1 Beliefs of precisely the same sort are held to
this day almost at our own door, in the eastern
counties of England, where people still imagine that
they can heal a wound by greasing the instrument
which inflicted it. To take a recent example of this
superstition, at Norwich in June 1902 a woman named
Matilda Henry accidentally ran a nail into her foot.
When the nail was extracted, she did not examine the
wound nor even take off her stocking, but told her
daughter to grease the nail, saying that if that were
done, no harm would come of the hurt. Under this
treatment the nail recovered, but the woman died of
lockjaw a few days afterwards. 2
Similarly in Bavaria
you are directed to anoint a linen rag with grease and
tie it on the edge of the axe that cut you, taking care
to keep the sharp edge upwards. As the grease on the axe dries, your wound heals. 3
The sympathetic connexion supposed to exist between
a man and the weapon which has wounded him is prob
ably founded on the notion that the blood on the
weapon continues to feel with the blood in his body.
For that reason the Papuans of Tumleo, an island off
German New Guinea, are careful to throw into the sea
the bloody bandages with which their wounds have

been dressed, for fear that if these rags fell into the
hands of an enemy he might bewitch them thereby.
Once when a man with a wound in his mouth, which
bled constantly, came to the missionaries to be treated,
his faithful wife took great pains to collect all the blood
and cast it into the sea. 1 But the doctrine of magical
contagion is stretched still further, so to include a man's
clothes as well as the severed parts of himself. On this
doctrine, whatever is done to the clothes is done to the
man himself, and he feels the effect even though he may
not be wearing the clothes at the time. That is why
these same Papuans of Tumleo search most anxiously
for the smallest scrap which they may have lost of
their scanty garments, 2 and why other Papuans, in
travelling through the thick forest, will stop and care
fully scrape from a bough any clot of red pomade which may have adhered to it from their greasy
heads, lest a sorcerer should get possession of the rag
or of the pomade and do them a mischief by means
of it. 8
The last example of Contagious Magic which I shall notice is the relation supposed to exist between a
man and the impressions left by his body in sand or
earth. In virtue of the law of contact the sand or
earth which bears the imprint of your body is supposed
to remain for all practical purposes an integral part of

8o MAGIC OF FOOTPRINTS LECT.
yourself even when you are far away, so that you will
feel any injury done to the imprint as if it were done to
your person. In particular, it is a world-wide super
stition that by injuring footprints you injure the feet that made them. Thus, the inhabitants of Galela, in
the East Indies, think that if anybody sticks something
sharp into your footprints while you are walking, you will be wounded in your feet. 1 In Japan, if a house
has been robbed by night and the burglar's footprints are visible in the morning, the injured householder will
burn mugwort on them, hoping thereby to hurt the robber's feet so that he cannot run far and the police
may easily overtake him. 2
Similarly, the Wyingurri tribe in Australia have a magical instrument which they
call a sun, because it is supposed to contain the solar
heat. By placing it on a man's tracks they think they
can throw him into a violent fever, which will soon
burn him up.
3 Practices of the same sort prevail in
some parts of Europe. For example, in Germany, earth from a footprint is tied up in a cloth and hung in
the chimney smoke ; as it dries up, so the man withers
away or his foot shrivels up.
4 A Bohemian variation
of the charm is to boil the earth from the footprint in a
pot along with nails, needles, and broken glass : the

man whose footprint has thus been boiled will have a
lame leg for the rest of his life. 1
The same superstition is turned to account by
hunters for the purpose of running down the game.
Thus the Thompson Indians of British Columbia used
to lay charms on the tracks of wounded deer ; after
that they deemed it superfluous to pursue the animal
any farther that day, for, being thus charmed through
its footprints, it could not travel far and would soon
die. 2 Similarly, Ojebway Indians placed " medicine " on the track of the first deer or bear they met with,
supposing that this would soon bring the animal into
sight, even if it were two or three days' journey ofF;
for this charm had power to compress a journey of
several days into a few hours. 8
These examples may suffice to illustrate the principles
of Contagious Magic.
We have now concluded our examination of the
general theory of magic, but I wish for a short time
to direct your attention to certain special applications
of the art.
The examples of magical rites which I have put
before you have been drawn almost wholly from what
may be called private magic, that is, from magical rites and incantations practised for the benefit or the

injury of individuals. But in savage society there is
commonly to be found in addition what we may call
public magic, that is, sorcery practised for the benefit of the whole community. Wherever ceremonies of this
sort are observed for the common good, it is obvious
that the magician ceases to be merely a private practitioner and becomes to some extent a public function
ary. The development of such a class of functionaries
is of great importance for the political as well as the religious evolution of society. For when the
welfare of the tribe is supposed to depend on the
performance of these magical rites, the magician becomes a personage of much influence and repute,
and may readily acquire the rank and authority of a
chief or king. The profession accordingly draws into its ranks some of the ablest and most ambitious men of
the tribe, because it holds out to them a prospect of
honour, wealth, and power such as hardly any other
career could offer. The acuter minds perceive how
easy it is to dupe their weaker brother and to play on
his superstition for their own advantage. Not that the
sorcerer is always a knave and impostor ; he is often
sincerely convinced that he really possesses those wonderful powers which the credulity of his fellows
ascribes to him. But the more sagacious he is, the
more likely he is to see through the fallacies which
impose on duller wits. Thus the ablest members of the
profession must tend to be more or less conscious
deceivers ; and it is just these men who in virtue of
their superior ability will generally come to the top



in THEIR RISE TO POPPER 83
and win for themselves positions of the highest dignity
and the most commanding authority. The pitfalls
which beset the path of the professional sorcerer are
many, and as a rule only the man of coolest head and
sharpest wit will be able to steer his way through them
safely. For it must always be remembered that every
single profession and claim put forward by the magician as such is false ; not one of them can be maintained
without deception, conscious or unconscious. Accord
ingly the sorcerer who sincerely believes in his own
extravagant pretensions is in far greater peril and is much more likely to be cut short in his career than the
deliberate impostor. The honest wizard always expects
that his charms and incantations will produce their
supposed effect ; and when they fail, not only really, as
they always do, but conspicuously and disastrously, as
they often do, he is taken aback : he is not, like his
knavish colleague, ready with a plausible excuse to account for the failure, and before he can find one he
may be knocked on the head by his disappointed and
angry employers. The general result is that at this stage of social
evolution the supreme power tends to fall into the
hands of men of the keenest intelligence and the most
unscrupulous character. If we could balance the harm
they do by their knavery against the benefits they
confer by their superior sagacity, it might well be found
that the good greatly outweighed the evil. For more
mischief has probably been wrought in the world by
honest fools in high places than by intelligent rascals.



84 THE RISE OF MONARCHY LECT.
Once your shrewd rogue has attained the height of his
ambition, and has no longer any selfish end to further,
he may, and often does, turn his talents, his experience,
his resources, to the service of the public. Many men
who have been least scrupulous in the acquisition of
power have been most beneficent in the use of it,
whether the power they aimed at and won was that of
wealth, political authority, or what not. In the field of
politics the wily intriguer, the ruthless victor, may end
by being a wise and magnanimous ruler, blessed in his
lifetime, lamented at his death, admired and applauded
by posterity. Such men, to take two of the most con
spicuous instances, were Julius Cassar and Augustus.
But once a fool always a fool, and the greater the
power in his hands the more disastrous is likely to be
the use he makes of it. The heaviest calamity in
English history, the breach with America, might never have occurred if George the Third had not been an
honest dullard.
Thus, so far as the public profession of magic affected the constitution of savage society, it tended to
place the control of affairs in the hands of the ablest
man : it shifted the balance of power from the many to
the one : it substituted a monarchy for a democracy, or
rather for an oligarchy of old men ; for in general the
savage community is ruled, not by the whole body of
adult males, but by a council of elders. The change,
by whatever causes produced, and whatever the char
acter of the early rulers, was on the whole very bene
ficial. For the rise of monarchy appears to be an



in ESSENTIAL TO CIVILISATION 85
essential condition of the emergence of mankind from
savagery. No human being is so hidebound by custom
and tradition as your democratic savage ; in no state
of society consequently is progress so slow and difficult. The old notion that the savage is the freest of mankind
is the reverse of the truth. He is a slave, not indeed
to a visible master, but to the past, to the spirits of his
dead forefathers, who haunt his steps from birth to
death, and rule him with a rod of iron. What they
did is the pattern of right, the unwritten law to which
he yields a blind unquestioning obedience. The least
possible scope is thus afforded to superior talent to
change old customs for the better. The ablest man is
dragged down by the weakest and dullest, who neces
sarily sets the standard, since he cannot rise, while the
other can fall. The surface of such a society presents
a uniform dead level, so far as it is humanly possible to
reduce the natural inequalities, the immeasurable real
differences of inborn capacity and temper, to a false
superficial appearance of equality. From this low and
stagnant condition of affairs, which demagogues and
dreamers in later times have lauded as the ideal state,
the Golden Age, of humanity, everything that helps to raise society by opening a career to talent and pro
portioning the degrees of authority to men's natural abilities, deserves to be welcomed by all who have the
real good of their fellows at heart. Once these elevating
influences have begun to operate and they cannot be
for ever suppressed the progress of civilisation becomes
comparatively rapid. The rise of one man to supreme



86 INFLUENCE OF CONQUEST LECT.
power enables him to carry through changes in a single
lifetime which previously many generations might not have sufficed to effect ; and if, as will often happen, he
is a man of intellect and energy above the common, he
will readily avail himself of the opportunity. Even the
whims and caprices of a tyrant may be of service in
breaking the chain of custom which lies so heavy on the
savage. And as soon as the tribe ceases to be swayed
by the timid and divided counsels of the elders, and
yields to the direction of a single strong and resolute
mind, it becomes formidable to its neighbours and
enters on a career of aggrandisement, which at an
early stage of history is often highly favourable
to social, industrial, and intellectual progress. For
extending its sway, partly by force of arms, partly by the voluntary submission of weaker tribes, the
community soon acquires wealth and slaves, both of
which, by relieving some classes from the perpetual
struggle for a bare subsistence, afford them an
opportunity of devoting themselves to that dis
interested pursuit of knowledge which is the noblest
and most powerful instrument to ameliorate the lot
of man.
Intellectual progress, which reveals itself in the
growth of art and science and the spread of more
liberal views, cannot be dissociated from industrial or
economic progress, and that in its turn receives an
immense impulse from conquest and empire. It is no mere accident that the most vehement outbursts of
activity of the human mind have followed close on the



in BENEFFFS OF DESPOTISM 87
heels of victory, and that the great conquering races of
the world have commonly done most to advance and
spread civilisation, thus healing in peace the wounds
they inflicted in war. The Assyrians, the Greeks, the
Romans, the Arabs are our witnesses in the past : we
may yet live to see a similar outburst in Japan. Nor,
to remount the stream of history to its sources, is it
an accident that all the first great strides towards civili
sation have been made under despotic and theocratic
governments, like those of China, Egypt, Assyria, Mexico, and Peru, where the supreme ruler claimed
and received the servile allegiance of his subjects in the
double character of a king and a god. It is hardly too
much to say that at this early epoch despotism is the
best friend of humanity and, paradoxical as it may
sound, of liberty. For after all there is more liberty
in the best sense liberty to think our own thoughts
and to fashion our own destinies under the most
absolute despotism, the most grinding tyranny, than under the apparent freedom of savage life, where the
individual's lot is cast from the cradle to the grave in
the iron mould of hereditary custom.
So far, therefore, as the public profession of magic
has been one of the roads by which the ablest
men have passed to supreme power, it has contributed to emancipate mankind from the thraldom
or* tradition and to elevate them into a larger, freer
life, with a broader outlook on the world. This
is no small service rendered to humanity. And
when we remember further that in another direction



88 BENEFITS OF MAGIC LECT. in
magic has paved the way for science, we are forced to
admit that if the black art has done much evil, it has
also been the source of much good ; that if it is the
child of error, it has yet been the mother of freedom
and truth.

IN the last lecture we ended our consideration of the
general theory of magic. I pointed out that in practice the art may be employed for the benefit either of indi
viduals or of the whole community, and that according
as it is directed to one or other of these objects it may
be called private or public magic. Further, we saw
that the public magician occupies a position of great
influence, from which, if he is a prudent and able man,
he may advance step by step to the rank of a chief or
king. Thus an examination of public magic conduces
to an understanding of the early kingship, since in savage and barbarous society many chiefs and kings
appear to owe their authority in great measure to their
reputation as magicians.
Among the objects of public utility which magic may be employed to secure, the most essential is an

purveyors of food, the hunter, the fisher, the farmer, all
resort to magical practices in the pursuit of their various
callings ; but they do so as private individuals for the
benefit of themselves and their families, rather than as
public functionaries acting in the interest of the whole
people. It is otherwise when the rites are performed,
not by the hunters, the fishers, the farmers themselves,
but by professional magicians on their behalf. In
primitive society, where uniformity of occupation is the
rule, and the distribution of the community into different
classes of workers has hardly begun, every man is more
or less his own magician ; he practises charms and
incantations for his own good and the injury of his
enemies. But a great step in advance has been taken
when a special class of magicians has been instituted ;
when, in other words, a number of men have been set
apart for the express purpose of benefiting the whole community by their skill, whether that skill be directed
to the healing of disease, the forecasting of the future,
the regulation of the weather, or any other object of
general utility. The impotence of the means adopted
by most of these practitioners to accomplish their ends ought not to blind us to the immense importance of the
institution itself. Here is a body of men relieved, at least
in the higher stages of savagery, from the need of earn
ing their livelihood by hard manual toil, and allowed, nay
expected and encouraged, to prosecute researches into the secret ways of nature. It was at once their duty
and their interest to know more than their fellows, to



iv GERMS OF SCIENCE 91
acquaint themselves with everything that could aid man
in his arduous struggle with nature, everything that
could mitigate his sufferings and prolong his life. The
properties of drugs and minerals, the causes of rain and
drought, of thunder and lightning, the changes of the
seasons, the phases of the moon, the daily and yearly
journeys of the sun, the motions of the stars, the
mystery of life, and the mystery of death, all these
things must have excited the wonder of these early
philosophers, and stimulated them to find solutions of
problems that were doubtless often thrust on their
attention in the most practical form by the importunate
demands of their clients, who expected them not merely
to understand but to regulate the great processes of
nature for the good of man. That their first shots at
truth fell very far wide of the mark could hardly be
helped. The slow, the never-ending approach to truth,
as I have pointed out, consists in perpetually forming
and testing hypotheses, accepting those which at the time seem best to fit the facts, and rejecting the others.
The views of natural causation embraced by the savage
magician no doubt appear to us manifestly false and
absurd ; yet in their day they were legitimate hypotheses,
though they have not stood the test of experience.
Ridicule and blame are the just meed, not of those who
devised these crude theories, but of those who obsti
nately adhered to them after better had been propounded.
Certainly no men ever had stronger incentives in the
pursuit of truth than these savage sorcerers. To main
tain at least an appearance of knowledge was absolutely

necessary ; a single mistake detected might cost them
their life. This no doubt led them to practise impos
ture for the purpose of concealing their ignorance ; but it also supplied them with the most powerful motive
for substituting a real for a sham knowledge, since, if
you would appear to know anything, by far the best
way is actually to know it. Thus, however justly we
may reject the extravagant pretensions of magicians and
condemn the deceptions which they have practised on
mankind, the original institution of this class of men
has, take it all in all, been productive of incalculable
good to humanity. They were the direct predecessors,
not merely of our physicians and surgeons, but of our investigators and discoverers in every branch of natural
science. They began the work which has since been
carried to such glorious and beneficent issues by their
successors in after ages ; and if the beginning was poor
and feeble, this is to be imputed to the inevitable
difficulties which beset the pursuit of knowledge rather
than to the natural incapacity or wilful fraud of the
men themselves.
Of the things which the public magician sets himself
to do for the good of his tribe, one of the chief is to
control the weather and especially to ensure an adequate
fall of rain. Water is the first essential of life, and in
most countries the supply of it depends upon showers.
Without rain vegetation withers, animals and men
languish and die. Hence in savage communities the
rain-maker is a very important personage ; and often a
special class of magicians is formed for the purpose of



iv RAIN-MAKING 93
regulating the heavenly water-supply. The methods
by which they attempt to discharge the duties of their
office are commonly, though not always, based on the
principle of homoeopathic or imitative magic. If they wish to make rain they imitate it by sprinkling water or
by mimicking clouds : if their object is to stop rain
and to cause drought, they avoid water and resort to
warmth and fire for the sake of drying up the too
abundant moisture. Examples will illustrate their
various modes of procedure.
Thus in" time of drought the Tarahumares of
Mexico will sometimes throw water towards the sky
in order that God may replenish his supply. And in
the month of May they always burn the grass, so
that the whole country is then wrapped in smoke, and
travelling becomes difficult. They think that this is
necessary to produce rain, clouds of smoke being, in
their opinion, equivalent to rain-clouds. 1 In the Mara
tribe of Northern Australia the rain -maker goes to
a pool and sings over it his magic song. Then he
takes some of the water in his hands, drinks it, and
spits it out in various directions. After that he throws
water all over himself, scatters it about, and returns
to the camp. Rain is supposed to follow.2 To make
rain a party of Ainos will scatter water by means of
sieves, while others will take a porringer, fit it up with
sails and oars as if it were a boat, and then push or
draw it about the village and gardens, probably to

signify that the country will soon be flooded with
water. 1 In Laos, a province of Siam, the festival of
the New Year takes place about the middle of April.
The people assemble in the pagodas, which are
decorated with flowers and illuminated. The Buddhist
monks perform the ceremonies, and when they come to
the prayers for the fertility of the earth, the worshippers
pour water into little holes in the floor of the pagoda
as a symbol of the rain which they hope Buddha will
send down on the rice-fields. 2 The custom is clearly
one of those combinations of magic with religion which
meet us so often in the ritual of comparatively advanced
peoples. The Arab historian Makrisi describes a
method of stopping rain which is said to have been
resorted to by a tribe of nomads in Hadramaut. They
cut a bough from a certain tree in the desert, set it on
fire, and then sprinkled the burning branch with water.
After that the vehemence of the rain abated, just as
the water vanished when it fell on the glowing bough. 3
Some of the eastern Angamis of Manipur are said to
perform a somewhat similar ceremony for the opposite
purpose, in order, namely, to produce rain. The head
of the village puts a burning brand on the grave of a man who has died of burns, and then quenches the
brand with water, while he prays that rain may
fall. Here the putting out the fire with water,
which is an imitation of rain, is reinforced by the

iv STOPPING RAIN 95
influence of the dead man, who, having been burnt
to death, will naturally be anxious for the descent
of rain to cool his scorched body and relieve his
pangs.
1
Other people besides the Arabs have used fire as
a means of stopping rain. Thus the Telugus of India
send a little girl out into the rain with a burning
piece of wood in her hand, which she has to show to the
falling drops. This is supposed to arrest the downpour.2 At Port Stevens in New South Wales the medicine
men used to drive away rain by throwing fire-sticks
into the air, while at the same time they puffed and
shouted.8 Again, any man of the Anula tribe in
Northern Australia can stop rain by simply warming a
green stick in the fire, and then striking it against
the wind. 4
Among the Toradjas of Central Celebes the rain
doctor, whose special business it is to drive away rain,
takes care not to touch water either before or after the
performance of his professional duties, still less while he
is actually engaged in the discharge of them. He does not bathe, he eats with unwashed hands, he drinks
nothing but palm wine, and if he has to cross a stream
he avoids stepping in the water. Having thus prepared
himself for his task, he has a small hut built outside of
the village in a rice-field, and in this hut he keeps up a

little fire, which on no account may be suffered to go
out. In the fire he burns various kinds of wood, which
are supposed to possess the property of driving off rain ; and he puffs in the direction from which the rain
threatens to come, holding in his hand a packet of
leaves and bark which derive a similar cloud-compelling
virtue, not from their physiological properties, but from
their names, which happen to signify something dry or volatile. If clouds should appear in the sky while he
is at work, he takes lime in the hollow of his hand and
blows it towards them. Lime, being so very dry, is
obviously well adapted to disperse the damp clouds. Should rain afterwards be wanted, he has only to pour
water on his fire, and immediately the rain will descend
in sheets. 1 Again, in Central Celebes, when there has
been a long drought and the rice-stalks begin to shrivel
up, many of the villagers, especially the young folk, go to a neighbouring brook and splash each other with
water, shouting noisily, or squirt water on one another through bamboo tubes. Sometimes they imitate the
plump of rain by smacking the surface of the water
with their hands, or by placing an inverted gourd on it
and drumming on the gourd with their fingers.
2 The
Karo-bataks of Sumatra have a rain-making ceremony
which lasts a week. The men go about with bamboo
squirts and the women with bowels of water, and they
drench each other or throw the water into the air, and

when it drips down on them they cry, " The rain has
come."
Sometimes, as we have seen, the rain-charm operates
partly or wholly through the dead. An Armenian way
of making rain is to dig up a skull and fling it into
running water. 2 In Halmahera there is a practice of
throwing stones on a grave, in order that the ghost may
fall into a passion and avenge the disturbance, as he
imagines, by sending heavy rain.8 Sometimes, in order to procure rain, the Toradjas of Central Celebes make
an appeal to the compassion of the dead. Thus in one
of their villages there is the grave of a famous chief, the
grandfather of the present ruler. When the land suffers
from unseasonable drought, the people go to this grave,
pour water on it, and say, " O grandfather, have pity
on us ; if it is your will that this year we should eat,
then give rain/* After that they hang a bamboo tube
full of water over the grave ; there is a small hole in
the lower end of the bamboo, so that the water drips
from it continually. The tube is always refilled with
water until rain drenches the ground. 4 In this ceremony
you will observe that religion is blent with magic, for
the prayer to the dead chief, which is purely religious,
is eked out with a magical imitation of rain at his
grave. In order to procure rain the Wagogo of
German East Africa sacrifice black fowls, black sheep,
and black cattle at the graves of their ancestors, and the

rain-maker wears black clothes during the rainy season. 1
Here again the religious appeal to the spirits of the dead is strengthened by the black colour of the victims
and of the clothes, which is an imitation of dark rain
clouds.
Sometimes the rain -maker resorts to an entirely
different mode of obtaining the needed showers. He
neither imitates the fall of rain nor prays to his fore
fathers, but attempts to extort the waters of heaven
from those supernatural beings who have, so to say, cut him off at the main. The Chinese are adepts in
the art of thus taking the kingdom of heaven by
storm. If the god does not give rain, they will
threaten and beat him ; sometimes they publicly depose
him from the rank of deity. On the other hand, if the
wished-for showers fall, the god may get a step of
promotion by imperial decree. 2 It is said that in the
reign of Kia - King, fifth emperor of the Manchu
dynasty, a long drought desolated several provinces of Northern China. Processions were of no avail ; the
rain -dragon hardened his heart and would not let
a drop fall. At last the emperor lost patience and
condemned the recalcitrant deity to perpetual exile
on the banks of the river Illi. The decree was in
process of execution : the divine criminal, with a
touching resignation, was already traversing the deserts

of Tartary to work out his sentence on the borders of
Turkestan, when the judges of the high court of
Peking, moved with compassion, flung themselves
at the feet of the emperor and implored his pardon for the poor devil. The emperor consented to revoke
his doom, and a messenger set off at full gallop to bear
the tidings of mercy to the executors of the imperial
justice. The dragon was reinstated in his office on
condition of performing his duties a little better in
future. 1 In April 1888 the mandarins of Canton
prayed to the god Lung-wong to stop the incessant downpour of rain ; and when he turned a deaf ear to
their petitions they put him in a lock-up for five days. This had a salutary effect. The rain ceased and the
god was restored to liberty. Some years before, in
time of drought, the same deity had been chained and
exposed to the sun for days in the courtyard of his
temple in order that he might feel for himself the
urgent need of rain. 2 So when the Siamese are in want
of rain, they set out their idols in the blazing sun ; but
if they need dry weather, they unroof the temples and
let the rain pour down on the idols. They think that
the inconvenience to which the gods are thus subjected
by the inclemency of the weather will induce them to
grant the wishes of their worshippers.8

Far East ; but precisely similar modes of procuring rain
have been resorted to in Europe within our own lifetime.
By the end of April 1893 tnere was great distress
in Sicily for lack of water. The drought had lasted
six months. Every day the sun rose and set in a sky
of cloudless blue. The gardens of the Conca d' Oro,
which surround Palermo with a magnificent belt of
verdure, were withering. Food was becoming scarce.
The people were in great alarm. All the most
approved methods of procuring rain had been tried
without effect. Processions had traversed the streets
and the fields. Men, women, and children, telling
their beads, had lain whole nights before the holy
images. Consecrated candles had burned day and
night in the churches. Palm branches, blessed on
Palm Sunday, had been hung on the trees. At
Solaparuta, in accordance with a very old custom,
the dust swept from the churches on Palm Sunday
had been spread on the fields. In ordinary years
these holy sweepings preserve the crops ; but that
year, if you will believe me, they had no effect
whatever. At Nicosia the inhabitants, bare-headed and
bare-foot, carried the crucifixes through all the wards
of the town and scourged each other with iron whips.
It was all in vain. The great St. Francis of Paola
himself, who annually performs the miracle of rain and
is carried every spring through the market-gardens, either could not or would not help. Masses, vespers,
concerts, illuminations, fire-works, nothing could
move him. At last the peasants began to lose



iv RAIN-MAKING 101
patience. Most of the saints were banished. At
Palermo they dumped St. Joseph in a garden
to see the state of things for himself, and they
swore to leave him there in the sun till rain fell.
Other saints were turned, like naughty children,
with their faces to the wall. Others again, stripped
of their beautiful robes, were exiled far from their
parishes, threatened, grossly insulted, ducked in horse
ponds. At Caltanisetta the golden wings of St.
Michael the Archangel were torn from his shoulders
and replaced with wings of pasteboard : his purple mantle was taken away and a clout wrapt about him
instead. At Licata the patron saint, St. Angelo, fared
even worse, for he was left without any garments at
all : he was reviled, he was put in irons, he was
threatened with drowning or hanging. " Rain or
the rope !
" roared the angry people at him, as they
shook their fists in his face. 1
As the magician thinks he can make rain, so he
fancies he can cause the sun to shine and can hasten or
stay its going down. Thus the natives of New
Caledonia imagine that they can cause a drought by
means of a disc-shaped stone with a hole in it. At
the moment when the sun rises, the wizard holds this
stone in his hand and passes a burning brand repeatedly
into the hole, while he says, " I kindle the sun, in

order that he may eat up the clouds and dry up our
land, so that it may produce nothing." When the
mists lay thick on the Sierras of Peru, the Indian
women used to rattle the silver and copper ornaments
which they wore on their breasts, and they blew against
the fog, hoping thus to disperse it and make the sun
shine through. Another way of producing the same
result was to burn salt or scatter ashes in the air. 2 The
Guarayo Indians also threw ashes in the air for the
sake of clearing up the clouded evening sky. Perhaps the fall of the ashes to the ground was supposed to
make the clouds disappear from the sky.3 The offer
ing made by the Brahman in the morning is supposed
to produce the sun, for we are told that "assuredly
it would not rise, were he not to make that offering."
4
The ancient Mexicans conceived the sun as the source
of all vital force ; hence they named him " He by
whom men live." But if he bestowed life on the
world, he needed also to receive life from it. And as
the heart is the seat and symbol of life, bleeding hearts
of men and animals were presented to the sun to
maintain him in vigour and enable him to run his
course across the sky. Hence the Mexican sacrifices
to the sun were magical rather than religious, being
designed, not so much to please and propitiate him, as

physically to renew his energies of heat, light, and motion. The constant demand for human victims to
feed the solar fires was met by waging war every year
on the neighbouring tribes and bringing back bands of
captives to be sacrificed on the altar. Thus the cease
less wars of the Mexicans and their cruel system of
human sacrifices, the most monstrous on record,
sprang in great measure from a mistaken theory of
the solar system. No more striking illustration could
be given of the disastrous consequences that may flow
in practice from a purely speculative error. 1 The ancient Greeks believed that the sun drove in a
chariot across the sky ; hence the Rhodians, who
worshipped the sun as their chief deity, annually dedicated a chariot and four horses to him, and flung
them into the sea for his use. 2 Doubtless they thought
that after a year's work his old horses and chariots
would be worn out. From a like motive, probably,
the idolatrous kings of Judah dedicated chariots and
horses to the sun, 8 and the Spartans,

Massagetae 1 sacrificed horses to him. The Spartans
performed the sacrifice on the top of the lofty range
of Mt. Taygetus, behind which they saw the great
luminary set every night. It was as natural for the
inhabitants of the valley of Sparta to do this as it was
for the islanders of Rhodes to throw the chariot and
horses into the sea, into which the sun seemed to
them to sink at evening. For thus, whether on the
mountains or in the sea, the fresh horses stood ready
for the weary god where they would be most welcome,
at the end of his day's journey.
As some people think they can light up the sun, so
others fancy they can retard or stop him. When the
sun is going southward in autumn and sinking lower
and lower in the Arctic sky, some of the Esquimaux
play the game of cat's cradle in order to catch him in
the meshes of the string and so prevent his disappearance below the horizon. On the contrary, in spring,
when the sun is moving northward and mount
ing higher and higher in the heaven, they play the game of cup-and-ball to hasten his return and enable
him to bound nimbly upwards, like the ball in the air. 2
The whole record of savage superstition could hardly furnish a more glaring instance of the futility of magic
than this attempt of the Esquimaux to regulate the sun's course in the sky by playing at cat's cradle and

cup-and-ball. As some people imagine they can hasten the sun, so others fancy they can jog the tardy moon.
The natives of German New Guinea, like many
other savages, reckon months by the moon, and some
of them have been known to throw stones and spears
at the moon in order to accelerate its progress and so
to hasten the return of their friends, who were away
from home for twelve months, working on a tobacco
plantation.

Lastly, the wizard believes that by his ceremonies
and incantations he can direct the course of the stormy
wind and can make it blow or be still at his pleasure.
Thus if a Cherokee wizard desires to turn aside an
approaching storm, he faces it and recites a spell with
outstretched hand. Then he gently blows in the
direction in which he wishes it to go, waving his
hand towards that quarter as if he were pushing
away the storm. 2 The natives of Bibili, an island
off German New Guinea, are reputed to raise tempests
by blowing with their mouths. In stormy weather
some of their neighbours will say, "The Bibili
folk are at it again, blowing away." The natives
of Murray Island in Torres Straits used to make
a great wind blow from the south-east by pointing
cocoa-nut leaves and other plants at two granitic
boulders on tte shore. So long as the leaves remained

there, the wind sat in that quarter. But with great
discretion they only performed the ceremony during the prevalence of the south-east monsoon. They
knew better than to try to raise a south-east wind
while the north-west monsoon was blowing.
1 On the
top of a mountain in Togo, a district of German
West Africa, there resides a fetish called Bagba, who is
supposed to control the wind and the rain. His
priest is said, like ^Eolus, to keep the winds shut up in
great pots.
2 An ancient Greek charm to prevent
storms from damaging the crops was to bury a toad
in a new earthen pot in the middle of the field. 3 Even
in Christian times, under the reign of Constantine, a
certain Sopater suffered death at Constantinople on a
charge of binding the winds by magic, because it
happened that the corn-ships of Egypt and Syria were detained afar off by calms or head-winds, to the rage
and disappointment of the hungry Byzantine rabble. 4
The sketch which I have thus given you of
the theory and practice of magic may suffice for our
purpose. We now revert to our special subject, the sacred character and magical functions of kings in early
society. I have pointed out that among savages the
public magician is a personage of such influence that under favourable circumstances he may easily attain to
the rank of a chief or king. I shall now put before you

some particular cases where this evolution appears either
to be in process of taking place or actually to have been
accomplished. Let us begin by looking at the lowest race of men as
to whom we possess comparatively full and accurate in
formation, I mean the aborigines of Australia. These
savages are ruled neither by chiefs nor kings. So far as
their tribes can be said to have a political constitution,
it is a democracy or rather an oligarchy of old and
influential men, who meet in council and decide on all
measures of importance, to the practical exclusion of
the younger men. Their deliberative assembly answers
to the senate of later times : if we had to coin a word
for such a government of elders we might call it a
gerontocracy.
1 The elders who in Australia thus
meet and direct the affairs of their tribe appear to be
for the most part the headmen of their respective totem
groups. As you probably know, the Australian abori
gines are divided into a great many clans or stocks,
each of which stands in a very intimate relation to a
particular species of natural objects, generally of animals or plants, which is called its totem. Now in Central
Australia, where the barren nature of the country and
the almost complete isolation from foreign influences
have retarded progress and preserved the natives on the
whole in their most primitive state, the headmen of the
various totem stocks or clans are charged with the
important task of performing magical ceremonies for the

multiplication of the totems, and as the great majority of the totems are edible animals or plants, it follows
that these men are commonly expected to provide the people with food by means of magic. Others have to
make the rain to fall or to render other services to the
community. In short, among the tribes of Central
Australia the headmen are public magicians. Further,
their most important function is to take charge of the
sacred storehouse, usually a cleft in the rocks or a hole
in the ground, where the holy stones and sticks are
kept, with which the souls of all the people, both living
and dead, appear to be in a manner bound up. Thus,
while the headmen have certainly to perform what we
should call civil duties, such as to inflict punishment for
breaches of tribal custom, their principal functions are
sacred or magical.
1
Again, in the tribes of South-Eastern Australia the
headman was often, sometimes invariably, a magician.
Thus in the southern Wiradjuri tribe the headman was
always a wizard or medicine-man. There was one for
each local division. He called the people together for
the initiation ceremonies or to discuss matters of public
importance. 2 In the Yerkla-mining tribe the medicinemen are the headmen ; they are called Mobung-bai,
from mobung, " magic." They decide disputes, arrange marriages, conduct the ceremonies of initiation, and in
certain circumstances settle the formalities to be observed

in ordeals of battle. " In fact, they wield authority in
the tribe, and give orders where others only make
requests."
l Again, in the Yuin tribe there was a head
man for each local division, and in order to be fitted
for his office he had, among other qualifications, to be a medicine-man ; above all, he must be able to perform
magical feats at the initiation ceremonies. The greatest
headman of all was he who on these occasions could bring
up the largest number of things out of his inside. 2 In
fact the budding statesman and king must be above all
things a conjurer in the most literal sense of the word.
Some forty years ago the principal headman of the Dieri
tribe was a certain Jalina piramurana, who was known
among the colonists as the Frenchman on account of his
polished manners. He was not only a brave and skilful
warrior, but also a powerful medicine -man, greatly
dreaded by the neighbouring tribes, who sent him
presents even from a distance of a hundred miles. He
boasted of being the " tree of life," for he was the head
of a totem consisting of a particular sort of seed which
forms at certain times the chief vegetable food of these
tribes. His people spoke of him as the plant itself
(manyurd) which yields the edible seed. 8 On the whole,
it is highly significant that in the most primitive society now open to our observation it is especially the
magicians or medicine-men who appear to be in the act
of developing into chiefs.

When we pass from Australia to New Guinea we
find that, though the natives occupy a far higher level
of culture than the Australian aborigines, the constitu
tion of society among them is still essentially democratic
or oligarchic, and chieftainship exists only in embryo. But here also it would seem that the medicine-men are
on the road to become chiefs. Thus Sir William
MacGregor tells us that in British New Guinea no one
has ever arisen wise enough, bold enough, and strong
enough to become the despot even of a single district.
" The nearest approach to this," says Sir William
MacGregor, " has been the very distant one of some
person becoming a renowned wizard ; but that has only
resulted in levying a certain amount of blackmail." 1
We are told that in the Toaripi or Motumotu tribe of
British New Guinea chiefs have not necessarily super
natural powers, but that a sorcerer is looked upon as a
chief. Some years ago, for example, one man of the
tribe was a chief because he was supposed to rule the
sea, calming it or rousing it to fury at his pleasure. Another owed his power to his skill in making the rain to
fall, the sun to shine, and the plantations to bear fruit.2
It is believed that the chief of Mowat, in British New
Guinea, can affect the growth of crops for good or ill,
and coax the turtle and dugong to come from all parts
of the sea and allow themselves to be caught. 3

iv CHIEFS IN MELANESIA 1 1 1
Again, we hear of a chief of Kolem, in German New
Guinea, who enjoyed a great reputation as a sorcerer ; it was believed that he could make wind and storm,
rain and sunshine, and visit his enemies with sickness
and death. 1
Turning now to the Melanesian islands, we are told
by Dr. Codrington that among these savages " as a
matter of fact the power of chiefs has hitherto rested
upon the belief in their supernatural power derived
from the spirits or ghosts with which they had inter
course. As this belief has failed, in the Banks' Islands,
for example, some time ago, the position of a chief has
tended to become obscure ; and as this belief is now
being generally undermined, a new kind of chief must
needs arise, unless a time of anarchy is to begin." 2
According to a native Melanesian account, the authority
of chiefs rests entirely on the belief that they hold
communication with mighty ghosts, and possess that
supernatural power whereby they are able to bring the influence of the ghosts to bear. If a chief imposed
a fine, it was paid because the people universally
dreaded his ghostly power, and firmly believed that he
could inflict calamity and sickness upon such as resisted
him. As soon as any considerable number of his
subjects began to disbelieve in his influence with the
ghosts, his power to levy fines was shaken.8 In the
northern New Hebrides the son does not inherit the
chieftainship, but he inherits, if his father can manage

it, what gives him chieftainship, namely, his father's
supernatural power, his charms, magical songs, stones
and apparatus, and his knowledge of the way to
approach spiritual beings.
1
Still rising in the scale of civilisation, or rather of
savagery, we come to Africa, where both the chieftain
ship and the kingship are fully developed ; and here the evidence for the evolution of the chief out of the
magician, and especially out of the rain-maker, is com
paratively plentiful. Thus among the Wagogo of German East Africa the main power of the chiefs, we
are told, is derived from their art of rain-making. If
a chief cannot make rain himself, he must procure it
from some one who can.2 The medicine-men of the
Masai, according to Sir Harry Johnston, are not
uncommonly their chiefs, and the supreme chief is
almost invariably a powerful medicine-man. These
men are priests as well as doctors, skilled in interpreting
omens and dreams, in averting ill-luck, and in making
rain. 8 The head chief is expected not only to make
rain, but to destroy the enemies of the Masai in war by
means of his magic. 4 With regard to this supreme
chief of the Masai I will translate to you the account of
his office and functions which Captain Merker gives in
his book on the Masai published last year. The
writer is a German officer serving in East Africa.

He says : u The most prominent clan of the whole
Masai people is the En gidony because to it belong
not only the family of the chief (ol oibon'i), but also the
family of the magicians. The designation chief is,
strictly speaking, not quite correct, since the chief
(ol oiboni) does not govern directly and exercises no
real administrative function. He rules only indirectly ;
the firm belief of his subjects in his prophetic gifts and
in his supernatural power of sorcery gives him an influ
ence on the destinies of the people. Despotism and
cruelty, as such we find among all negro rulers, are alien
to him. He is not so much a ruler as a national saint or
patriarch. The people speak of his sacred person with shy
awe, and no man dares to appear before this mighty per
sonage without being summoned. The aim of his policy
is to unite and strengthen the Masai. While he allows
free play to the predatory instincts of the warriors in
raids on other tribes, he guards his own people from
the scourge of civil war, to which the ceaseless quarrels
of the various districts with each other would otherwise
continually give occasion. This influence of his is
rendered possible by the belief that victory can only be
achieved through the secret power of the war-medicine
which none but he can compound, and that defeat
would infallibly follow if he were to predict it. Neither
he nor his nearest relatives march with the army to war.
He supplies remedies, generally in the shape of magical
medicines, for plagues and sicknesses, and he appoints
festivals of prayer in honour of the Masai god 'Ng at.
He delivers his predictions by means of an oracular

game like the telling of beads." l And just as Samson's
miraculous strength went from him when his hair was
shorn, so it is believed that the head chief of the Masai
would lose his supernatural powers if his chin were
shaved. Captain Merker tells us further that so firmly
did the Masai believe in the magical gift of healing
possessed by the late chief Mbatyan, that people are said to have been often cured of their infirmities by faith
alone. 2 The same chief, according to Captain Merker,
actually discovered a mode of inoculation which protected
the cattle against the ravages of lung disease. If this
statement is correct, we have here a striking instance of
a most beneficent scientific discovery made by a savage
magician, which illustrates what I have said as to the
immense advantages which at a certain stage of social
development may flow from the institution of a public
body of magicians or medicine-men.
The Suk and Turkana peoples of East Africa, who
are akin to the Masai, distinguish between their chiefs
and their medicine-men, who wield great power ; but
very often the medicine-man is a chief by virtue of his
skill in medicine or occult arts.3 Among the negroes
of the Upper Nile the medicine-men are generally
the chiefs. 4 Thus among the Bongo (to quote from
Schweinfurth) " good spirits are quite unrecognised,
and, according to the general negro idea, no benefit can

ever come from a spirit at all. They affirm that the
only thing they know about spirits is that they do
mischief, and certain it is that they have no conception
either of there being a Creator or any kind and ruling
power above. They assert that there is no resource
for obtaining communication with spirits except by means of certain roots, which may be of service likewise
in employing the powers of evil to inflict injury on
others. To their knowledge of this magic may be
attributed much of the influence which the native chiefs,
independently of their authorised rule, exercise over the
mass of the people in their districts. This may be
witnessed among the Bary on the Bahr-el-Gebel, and a
hundred other tribes, who yield the greatest deference
to the controllers or captains of their communities." l
In the Dinka or Denka nation, to the north-east of
the Bongo, men who are supposed to be in close com
munication with spirits pass for omnipotent ; it is
believed that they make rain, conjure away all calami
ties, foresee the future, exorcise evil spirits, know all
that goes on even at a distance, have the wild beasts in
their service, and can call down every kind of disaster
on their enemies. One of these men became the richest
and most esteemed chief of the Kic" tribe through his skill
in ventriloquism. He kept a cage from which the roars
of imaginary lions and the howls of imaginary hyenas were heard to proceed ; and he gave out that these
beasts guarded his house, and were ready at his bidding to rush forth on his enemies. The dread which he

infused among the tribe, and beyond it, was incredible :
from all sides oxen were sent him as presents, so that
his herds were the most numerous of the neighbourhood.
Another of these conjurers in the Tuic tribe had a real
tame lion and four real fat snakes, which slept in front
of his door, to the great awe of the negroes, who could
only attribute their pacific demeanour to sorcery.
1 But
it does not appear that the real lion inspired nearly so
much terror as the imaginary one ; from which we may
infer that among these people ventriloquism is a more
solid basis of political power even than lion-taming. The Lendu tribe, to the west of Lake Albert, in Central
Africa, firmly believe that certain people possess the
power of making rain. Among them the rain-maker
either is a chief or almost invariably becomes one. 2
Again, the Wanyoro of Central Africa have a great
respect for the dispensers of rain, whom they load with
a profusion of gifts. The great dispenser, who has absolute and uncontrollable power over the rain, is the
king ; but he can divide his power with other persons,
so that the benefit may be distributed over various parts
of the kingdom. 3 With regard to the natives of the
Nyanza region in general we are told that " they are
persuaded that rain only falls as a result of magic, and
the important duty of causing it to descend devolves
on the chief of the tribe. If rain does not come

at the proper time, everybody complains. More than one petty king has been banished his country because
of drought.'*
l A Catholic missionary writes that " a
superstition common to the different peoples of equatorial Africa attributes to the petty kings of the country
the exclusive power of making the rain to fall ; in
extreme cases the power is ascribed to certain kings
more privileged than the rest, such as those of Huilla,
Humbe, Vare, Libebe, and others. These kings profit
by the superstition in order to draw to themselves many
presents of cattle ; for the rain must fall after the
sacrifice of an ox, and if it tarries, the king, who is
never at a loss for excuses to extricate himself from the
scrape, will ascribe the failure to the defects of the
victim, and will seize the pretext to claim more cattle."
In Western as well as in Eastern and Central Africa
we find the same union of chiefly with magical functions.
Thus in the Fan tribe the strict distinction between
chief and medicine-man does not exist. The chief is
also a medicine-man and a smith to boot ; for the Fans
esteem the smith's craft sacred, and none but chiefs
may meddle with it.8 The head chief of Etatin in
Southern Nigeria, like other petty kings in that part
of the world, is never allowed to leave his compound,
that is, the enclosure in which his house stands.
The present incumbent of the office was lately
questioned by an English Commissioner, to whom he

gave the following account of himself and his duties.
He said : " The whole town forced me to be head
chief. They hanged our big juju [or fetish] (the
buffalo's horns) round my neck. Had I refused, I
should have had to give them the value of two slaves.
It is an old custom that the head-chief here shall never
leave his compound. I have been shut up ten years,
but, being an old man, I don't miss my freedom. I
am the oldest man of the town, and they keep me here
to look after the jujus [or fetishes], and to conduct
the rites celebrated when women are about to give birth
to children, and other ceremonies of the same kind. By
the observance and performance of these ceremonies, I
bring game to the hunter, cause the yam crop to be
good, bring fish to the fisherman, and make rain to
fall. So they bring me meat, yams, fish, etc. To
make rain, I drink water, and squirt it out, and pray to
our big deities. If I were to go outside this compound,
I should fall down dead on returning to this hut. My
wives cut my hair and nails, and take great care of the
parings."
l Thus from his own account we see that this
West African chief is above all a magician, though he
also acts as a priest by offering prayer to the gods. As to the relation between the offices of chief and
rain-maker among the Caffres of South Africa, I will
quote a passage from Mr. Dudley Kidd, a recent and
well-informed writer on the subject. He says : "In
very old days the chief was the great Rain-maker of
the tribe. Some chiefs allowed no one else to compete

iv CHIEFS IN AFRICA 119
with them, lest a successful Rain-maker should be
chosen as chief. There was also another reason : the
Rain-maker was sure to become a rich man if he gained
a great reputation, and it would manifestly never do for the chief to allow any one to be too rich. The Rain
maker exerts tremendous control over the people, and
so it would be most important to keep this function
connected with royalty. Tradition always places the
power of making rain as the fundamental glory of
ancient chiefs and heroes, and it seems probable that
it may have been the origin of chieftainship. The man who made the rain would naturally become the
chief. In the same way, Chaka [the famous Zulu
despot] used to declare that he was the only diviner in
the country, for if he allowed rivals, his life would be
insecure." l
A
letter, dated from Buluwayo, the 2Oth of Novem
ber 1880, records that " the king [of the Matabeles] Lo
Bengula arrived yesterday evening at his kraal of * the
White Rocks.* He brought with him the rain to his
people. For, according to the ideas of the Matabeles,
it is the king who ought to * make the rain and the
good season * in all senses of the word. Now Lo
Bengula had chosen well the day and the hour, for it
was in the midst of a tremendous storm that the king
made his solemn entrance into his capital." " You
must know that the arrival of the king and of the rain
give rise every year to a little festival. For the rain is
the great benefit conferred by the king, the pledge

120 CHIEFS IN AFRICA LECT.
of future harvests and of plenty, after eight months of
desolating drought/* To bring down the needed showers the king of the Matabeles boils a magic hell
broth in a huge cauldron, which sends up volumes of
steam to the blue sky. But to make assurance doubly
sure, he has recourse to religion as well as to magic ;
for he sacrifices twelve black oxen to the spirits of his
fathers and prays to them : " O great spirits of my
father and grandfather, I thank you for having granted last year to my people more wheat than to our enemies
the Mashonas. This year also, in gratitude for the
twelve black oxen which I am about to dedicate to you,
make us to be the best-fed and the strongest people in
the world !
"
l Thus the king of the Matabeles acts
not only as a magician, but as a priest ; for he prays
and sacrifices to the spirits of his forefathers, as I had
occasion to point out in a former lecture.
The foregoing evidence, somewhat tedious perhaps
in its monotony, renders it highly probable that in Africa the king has often been developed out of the
public magician, and especially out of the rain-maker. The unbounded fear which the magician inspires and
the wealth he often amasses in the exercise of his pro
fession have both contributed to effect his promotion.
The miraculous powers ascribed to kings elsewhere are
at least consistent with the hypothesis that they too
have risen to their present exalted rank from a like
lowly origin. Thus the Malays firmly believe that the

iv MALAY KINGS 121
king possesses a personal influence over the works of
nature, such as the growth of the crops and the bearing
of fruit-trees. The same prolific virtue is supposed
to reside, though in a lesser degree, in his delegates,
and even in the persons of Europeans who chance to be
in charge of districts. In Selangor, one of the native
states of the Malay Peninsula, the success or failure of
the rice crops is often attributed to a change of district
officers. 1 Now in the Malay region the link which
unites the king or rajah with the magician happens to
be unusually plain and conspicuous. That link consists
in the regalia. For in some parts at least of the Malay
region the regalia are regarded as wonder-working talismans, the possession of which carries with it the
right to the throne ; if the king loses them, he thereby
forfeits the allegiance of his subjects. Moreover, and
this is a fact of great significance, the Malay magician owns certain insignia which are said to be exactly
analogous to the regalia of the divine king, and even
bear the same name.2 The inference seems almost
inevitable that in the Malay region the regalia of the
kings are only the conjuring apparatus of their pre
decessors the magicians, and that therefore, in this part
of the world at least, the magician is the humble grub
or chrysalis which in due time bursts and discloses that
gorgeous butterfly, the rajah or king. Nowhere apparently is this view of the regalia as the

122 MALAY REGALIA LECT.
true fount of regal dignity carried to such lengths as in
Southern Celebes. Here the royal authority is sup
posed to be in some mysterious fashion embodied in the
regalia, while the princes owe all the power they
exercise, and all the respect they enjoy, to their
possession of these precious objects. In short, the
regalia reign, and the princes are merely their representatives. Hence whoever chances to possess the
regalia is regarded by the people as their lawful king. For example, if a deposed monarch contrives to keep
the regalia, his former subjects remain loyal to him in
their hearts, and look upon his successor as a usurper,
who is to be obeyed only in so far as he can exact
obedience by force. And on the other hand, in an
insurrection the first aim of the rebels is to seize the
regalia, for if they can only make themselves masters of
them, the authority of the sovereign is gone. Thus the regalia are here fetishes which confer a title to the
throne, and control the fate of the kingdom. Houses
are built for them to dwell in, as if they were living
creatures : furniture, weapons, and even lands are
assigned to them. Like the ark of God, they are
carried with the army to battle, and on various occa
sions the people propitiate them, as if they were gods,
by prayer and sacrifice and by smearing them with
blood. Some of them serve as instruments of divina
tion, or are brought forth in times of public disaster
for the purpose of staying the evil, whatever it may be.
For example, when plague is rife among men or beasts,
or when there is a prospect of dearth, the Bugineese



i v MALAY REGALIA 1 2 3
bring out the regalia, smear them with buffalo's blood,
and carry them about. For the most part these fetishes
are heirlooms of which the origin is forgotten ; some
of them are said to have fallen from heaven. Popular
tradition traces the foundation of the oldest states to
the discovery or acquisition of one of these miraculous
objects it may be a stone, a piece of wood, a fruit, a
weapon, or what not, of a peculiar shape or colour.
Often the original regalia have disappeared in course of time, but their place is taken by the various articles of
property which were bestowed on them, and to which
the people have transferred their pious allegiance. The
oldest dynasties have the most regalia, and the holiest
regalia consist of relics of the bodies of former princes,
which are kept in golden caskets wrapt in silk. At
Paloppo, the capital of Loowoo, a kingdom on the coast of Celebes, two toy cannons, with barrels like
thin gas-pipes, are regalia : their possession is supposed
to render the town impregnable. Other regalia of this
kingdom are veiled from vulgar eyes in bark-cloth.
When a missionary requested to see them, the official
replied that it was strictly forbidden to open the
bundle ; were he to do so, the earth would yawn and
swallow them up. In Bima the principal part of the
regalia or public talismans consists of a sacred brown
horse, which no man may ride. It is always stabled in
the royal palace. When the animal passes the govern
ment fort on high days and holidays, it is saluted with
the fire of five guns : when it is led to the river to
bathe, the royal spear is carried before it, and any man

who does not make way for the beast, or crosses the
road in front of it, has to pay a fine. But the horse is
mortal, and when it goes the way of all horse flesh,
another steed chosen from the same stud reigns in its
place.

The belief that kings and chiefs possess either super
natural powers or wonder-working talismans has left
not a few traces of itself in Europe, and even in our
own country. The Homeric Greeks thought that the
reign of a good king caused the black earth to bring
forth wheat and barley, the trees to be loaded with
fruit, the flocks to multiply, and the sea to yield fish. 2
It was a belief of the ancient Irish that when their
kings observed the customs of their ancestors, the
seasons were mild, the crops plentiful, the cattle fruit
ful, the waters abounded with fish, and the fruit-trees

had to be propped up on account of the weight of their
produce. A canon attributed to St. Patrick enumerates
among the blessings that attend the reign of a just king
"fine weather, calm seas, crops abundant, and trees
laden with fruit." 1 Notions of the same sort have
lingered in the Highlands of Scotland down to modern
times. When Dr. Johnson travelled in Skye, it was
still held that the return of the chief of the Macleods
to Dunvegan, after any considerable absence, produced
a plentiful catch of herring.
2 To this day the family
of the same chief owns a banner which is called
" Macleod's Fairy Banner " on account of the super
natural powers ascribed to it. When it is unfurled,
victory in war attends it, and it relieves its followers
from imminent danger. But these virtues it can exert
only thrice, and already it has been twice unfurled.
When the potato crop failed, the common people
desired that the magical banner might be displayed,
8
apparently in the belief that the sight of it would
produce a fine crop of potatoes. The banner of this
highland chief is thus a talisman like the regalia of
a Malay rajah. Again, in the Middle Ages, German mothers offered
their infants to Waldemar First, king of Denmark,
to be touched by him, believing that the children
would thrive the better for the royal touch ; and for

a like reason farmers asked him to throw the seed for
them. 1 The English kings claimed the power of
curing scrofula by their touch ; for which reason the
disease was known as the King's Evil. Charles the
Second often exercised this miraculous gift of healing,
as we know from Pepys, who witnessed the ceremony
more than once. Thus on the thirteenth of April
1 66 1 he records in his diary: "Met my Lord with
the Duke ; and after a little talk with him, I went to
the Banquet-house, and there saw the king heale, the
first time that ever I saw him do it ; which he did
with great gravity, and it seemed to me to be an ugly
office and a simple one." 2 In his childhood Dr. Johnson
was touched for scrofula by Queen Anne, and he retained
in later life a faint but solemn recollection of her as of
a lady in diamonds with a long black hood. 3 The
French kings claimed to possess the same beneficent
power, which they are said to have derived from
Clovis or St. Louis, while our English kings inherited
it from Edward the Confessor. 4 But probably the
barbarous predecessors both of the Saxon and the
Merovingian kings had set up similar pretensions long before the dawn of history. Down to last century the
West African tribe of the Walos, in Senegal, ascribed

to their royal family the same power of healing by touch. Mothers have been seen to bring their sick children to
the queen, who touched them solemnly with her foot
on the back, the stomach, the head, and the legs ;
then the credulous women went away, persuaded that
the children had been made whole. 1
On the whole, then, we seem to be justified in con
cluding that in many parts of the world the king is the
lineal successor of the old magician or medicine-man.
When once a special class of sorcerers has been segre
gated from the community and entrusted by it with the
discharge of duties on which the public safety and
welfare are believed to depend, these men gradually rise
to wealth and power, till their leaders blossom out into
sacred kings. But the great social revolution which
thus begins with democracy and ends in despotism is attended by an intellectual revolution which affects both
the conception and the functions of royalty. For as
time goes on, the fallacy of magic becomes more and
more apparent to the acuter minds and is slowly dis
placed by religion ; in other words, the magician gives
way to the priest, who, renouncing the attempt to control directly the processes of nature for the good
of man, seeks to attain the same end indirectly by
appealing to the gods to do for him what he no longer
fancies he can do for himself. Hence the king,
starting as a magician, tends gradually to exchange the
practice of magic for the priestly functions of prayer

and sacrifice. And while the distinction between the
human and the divine is still imperfectly drawn, it is
often imagined that men may themselves attain to
godhead, not merely after their death, but in their
lifetime, through the temporary or permanent possession of their whole nature by a great and powerful
spirit. No class of the community has benefited so
much as kings by this belief in the possible incarnation
of a god in human form. The doctrine of that incar
nation, and with it the theory of the divinity of kings
in the strict sense of the word, will form the subject of
the next lecture.

IN the preceding lectures we saw grounds for thinking that in some parts of the world the public magician has
often developed into a chief or king, partly through
the terror which his reputed skill inspires, partly
through the wealth which he gains in the exercise of
his profession. Even among tribes such as the Aus
tralians and Papuans, who are too rude to have evolved
a regular chieftainship or kingship, we detected some
symptoms of the gravitation of political power towards the magicians or medicine-men. Among the American
Indians the furthest advance towards civilisation was
made under the monarchical and theocratic governments
of Mexico and Peru ; but we know too little of the
early history of these countries to say whether the

predecessors of their deified kings were medicine-men
or not. However, among some of the savage Brazilian
Indians at the time of the discovery of America, the
sorcerer appears to have been treated with a respect
which might in time have raised him to the rank of a
divine king, if the course of evolution had not been
cut short by the intervention of Europeans. Thus one
of the earliest settlers on the coast of Brazil, the
Frenchman Thevet, reports that the Indians " hold
these pages (or medicine-men) in such honour and reverence that they adore, or rather idolatrise them.
You may see the common folk go to meet them,
prostrate themselves, and pray to them, saying,
' Grant
that I be not ill, that I do not die, neither I nor my
children,' or some such request. And he answers,
' You shall not die, you shall not be ill/ and such like
replies. But sometimes if it happens that these pages
do not tell the truth, and things turn out otherwise
than they predicted, the people make no scruple of
killing them as unworthy of the title and dignity of
Among these Indians the magician is, or rather was,
plainly on the high road to become a living god as well
as a king. To the mind of a savage the distinction
between a powerful sorcerer and a god seems not to
be a sharp one. His gods are often merely invisible
magicians who behind the veil of nature work the same
sort of charms and incantations which the human
1 F. A. Thevet, Les singularitez de la France Antarctique, autrement nominee
Ame'rique (Antwerp, 1558), p. 65 [wrongly numbered 67].



v SAVAGE IDEA OF GOD 131
magician works in a visible and bodily form among his
fellows. And as the gods are commonly believed to
exhibit themselves in the likeness of men to their wor
shippers, it is easy for the magician, with his supposed
miraculous powers, to acquire the reputation of being an incarnate deity. Thus beginning as little more than
a simple conjurer, the medicine-man or magician tends
to blossom out into a full-blown god and king in one.
Only in speaking of him as a god we must beware
of importing into the savage conception of deity those very abstract and complex ideas which we attach to the
term. Our ideas on this profound subject are the fruit
of a long intellectual and moral evolution, and they are
so far from being shared by the savage that he cannot
even understand them when they are explained to him.
Much of the controversy which has raged as to the
religion of the lower races has sprung merely from
a mutual misapprehension. The savage does not understand the thoughts of the civilised man, and
few civilised men understand the thoughts of the
savage. When the savage uses his word for god,
he has in his mind a being of a certain sort : when the
civilised man uses his word for god, he has in his mind
a being of a very different sort ; and if, as commonly
happens, the two men are equally unable to place
themselves at the other's point of view, nothing but
confusion and mistakes on both sides can result from
their discussions. If we civilised men insist on limiting
the name of God to that particular conception of the
divine nature which we ourselves have formed, then we



132 HUMAN GODS LECT.
must confess that the savage has no god at all. But
we shall adhere more closely to the facts of history
if we allow most of the higher savages at least to
possess a rudimentary notion of certain supernatural
beings who may fittingly be called gods, though not in the full sense in which we use the word. That rudi
mentary notion represents in all probability the germ out of which the civilised peoples have gradually
evolved their own high conceptions of divinity ; and if we could trace the whole course of religious develop
ment we might find that the chain which links our
idea of the Godhead with that of the savage was one
and unbroken.
With these explanations I shall now give you some
instances of gods who are believed by their worshippers
to be incarnate in living human beings, whether men or
women. The persons in whom a deity is thought to
reveal himself are by no means always kings or descend
ants of kings ; the supposed incarnation may take place
even in men of the humblest rank. I shall therefore
not draw my examples exclusively from royal personages, as I wish to illustrate what we may call the general
principle of the deification of living men, in other words,
the incarnation of a deity in human form.
Thus, for example, a Catholic missionary, writing
some sixty years ago, tells us that the natives of Futuna,
an island in the South Pacific, " are not content with
deifying the evils that afflict them : they place gods
everywhere, and even go so far as to suppose that the
greatest of all the spirits resides in the person of their



v IN AFRICA 133
prince as in a living sanctuary. From this belief springs
a strange mode of regarding their king, and of behaving
under his authority. In their eyes the sovereign is not
responsible for his acts : they deem him inspired by the
divine spirit whose tabernacle he is : hence his will is
sacred : even his whims and rages are revered ; and if
it pleases him to play the tyrant, his subjects submit from conscientious motives to the vexations he inflicts
on them." l
An early Portuguese historian informs us that the
king of Sofala, in south-eastern Africa, " is a woolly
haired Kaffir, a heathen who adores nothing whatever,
and has no knowledge of God ; on the contrary, he
esteems himself the god of all his lands, and is so looked
upon and reverenced by his subjects." " When they
suffer necessity or scarcity they have recourse to the
king, firmly believing that he can give them all that they desire or have need of, and can obtain anything
from his dead predecessors, with whom they believe that
he holds converse. For this reason they ask the king
to give them rain when it is required, and other favour
able weather for their harvest, and in coming to ask
him for any of these things they bring him valuable
presents, which the king accepts, bidding them return to their homes, and he will be careful to grant their
petitions. They are such barbarians that though they see how often the king does not give them what they
ask for, they are not undeceived, but make him still

greater offerings, and many days are spent in these comings and goings, until the weather turns to rain,
and the Kaffirs are satisfied, believing that the king did
not grant their request until he had been well bribed
and importuned, as he himself affirms, in order to
maintain them in their error." 1 Again, the same early
Portuguese historian writes that the Zimbas, or Muzim
bas, another people of south-eastern Africa, " do not
adore idols or recognise any god, but instead they
venerate and honour their king, whom they regard as a
divinity, and they say that he is the greatest and best in the
world. And the said king says of himself that he alone
is god of the earth, for which reason if it rains when he
does not wish it to do so, or is too hot, he shoots arrows
at the sky for not obeying him." 2 The Maraves of
South Africa have, or had at least some seventy years
ago, " a spiritual head to whom they ascribe supernatural
powers, revering him as a prophet and designating him by the name of Chissumpe. Besides a considerable
territory, which he owns and rules, he receives tribute
from all, even from the king. They believe that this
being is invisible and immortal, and they consult him as
an oracle, in which case he makes himself heard. He
is personified by a substitute, whose dignity is hereditary
and who is revered exactly like the supposed Chissumpe, with whom he is naturally identical. As he names his
own successor, disputes as to the succession do not
arise. His oracles are as unintelligible and ambiguous

as can well be imagined. He derives great profit from
impostors of both sexes, who purchase the gift of
soothsaying from him." l In the Makalaka hills, to the west of Matabeleland,
there lives a human god. The account of him which
I shall quote was published in a Catholic missionary
journal some quarter of a century ago. This man-god
" resides in the depth of a cave, in the midst of a
labyrinth. Nobody has ever seen him, but he has sons
and daughters, who are priests and priestesses, and dwell
in the neighbourhood of the grotto. It is rather odd
that not long ago three sons of this god were put to
death like common mortals for having stolen wheat
from the king. Lo Bengula [the king of the Matabeles]
probably thought that they should practise justice even more strictly than other folk. ... In the middle of
the (oracular) cavern, they say, there is a shaft, very
deep and very black. From this gulf there issue from
time to time terrible noises like the crash of thunder.
On the edge of the abyss the worshippers tremblingly
lay flesh and wheat, fowls, cakes, and other presents to
appease the hunger of the dreadful god and secure his
favour. After making this offering the poor suppliants declare aloud their wishes and the object of their appli
cation. They ask to know hidden things, future events,
the names of those who have cast a spell on them, the

issue of such and such an enterprise. After some
moments of profound silence there are heard, amid the
crash of subterranean thunder, inarticulate sounds,
broken words, of which it is hard to make out the
sense, and which the medicine-men, who are hand in
glove with the makers of thunder, explain to these
credulous devotees." l
The Mashonas of South Africa have also a human
god, who does not wrap himself up in such a profound
mystery as the one I have just described. He was
formerly bound to render an annual tribute to the king
of the Matabeles in the shape of four black oxen and
one dance. A missionary has seen and described the
deity discharging the latter part of his duty in front of the royal hut. For three mortal hours without a break,
to the banging of a tambourine, the click of castanets,
and the drone of a monotonous song, the swarthy god
engaged in a frenzied dance, crouching on his hams like
a tailor, sweating like a pig, and bounding about with
an agility which testified to the strength and elasticity
of his divine legs.
2 The Sakalavas in the north of
Madagascar revere a sovereign whom they call Zanahari

a veneration which resembles idolatry, and the vulgar
are simple enough to attribute the creation of the world

and the different parts of his body and his least actions
are described by nouns and verbs which are foreign to

The deification of living men was not unknown in
ancient Greece. Thus the philosopher Empedocles
gave himself out to be not merely a wizard but a god.
Addressing his fellow-citizens in verses which I will
translate, he said :
O friend*i in this great city that climbs the yellow slope Of Agrigentum's citadel, who make good works your scope,
Who offer to the stranger a haven quiet andfair, All hail ! Among you honoured I walk with lofty air.
With garlands, blooming garlands, you crown my noble brow,
A mortal man no longer, a deathless godhead now.
Where'er I go, the people crowd round and worship pay, And thousands follow seeking to learn the better way.

He asserted that he could teach his disciples how to
make the wind to blow or be still, the rain to fall and
the sun to shine, how to banish sickness and old age, and
to raise the dead. 2 When Demetrius Poliorcetes restored
the Athenian democracy in 307 B.C., the Athenians
decreed divine honours to him and to his father
Antigonus, both of them being then alive. The two
new deities received the title of the Saviour Gods.
Altars were set up to them, and a priest was
appointed to attend to their worship. The people went

The ancient Germans believed that there was some
thing holy in women, and accordingly they consulted them as oracles. Their sacred women, we are told,
looked on the eddying rivers and listened to the mur
mur or the roar of the water, and from the sight and
sound foretold what should come to pass. But often
the veneration of the men went further, and they
worshipped women as true and living goddesses. For
example, in the reign of Vespasian a certain Veleda, of the

tribe of the Bructeri, was commonly held to be a deity,
and in that character she reigned over her people, her
sway being acknowledged far and wide. She lived in a
tower on the river Lippe, a tributary of the Rhine.
When the people of Cologne sent to make a treaty
with her, the ambassadors were not admitted to her
presence : the negotiations were conducted through a
minister, who acted as the mouthpiece of her divinity
and reported her oracular utterances. 1 This example
shows how easily among our own rude forefathers the
ideas of divinity and royalty coalesced.
At the present day the head of the great Persian
sect of the Babites, Abbas Effendi by name, resides at
Acre in Syria, and is held by Frenchmen, Russians, and
Americans, especially by rich American ladies, to be an
incarnation of God himself. The late Professor S. I.
Curtiss of Chicago had the honour of dining with " the
Master," as he is invariably called by his disciples, and
the deity expressed a kindly hope that he might have
the pleasure of drinking tea with the professor in the kingdom of heaven.2
But perhaps no country in the world is so prolific of human gods as India. The ancient Indian code known
as the Laws of Manu lays it down that a Brahman, " be
he ignorant or learned, is a great divinity, just as the fire, whether carried forth (for the performance of a
burnt oblation) or not carried forth, is a great divinity."
Further it is said in the same code that though Brahmans

"employ themselves in all sorts of mean occupations,
they must be honoured in every way ; for each of them
is a very great deity."
l And in another ancient Hindoo
treatise we read that " verily, there are two kinds of
gods ; for, indeed, the gods are the gods ; and the
Brahmans who have studied and teach sacred lore are
the human gods. The sacrifice of these is divided
into two kinds : oblations constitute the sacrifice to the
gods ; and gifts to the priests that to the human gods,
the Brahmans who have studied and teach sacred lore." 1
As to the mantras, or sacred texts by means of which
the Brahmans exert their miraculous powers, there is
a saying everywhere current in India, " The whole
universe is subject to the gods ; the gods are subject to
the Mantras ; the Mantras to the Brahmans ; therefore
the Brahmans are our gods." 3
At Chinchvad, a small town about ten miles from
Poona in western India, there lives a family of whom
one in each generation is believed by a large proportion of the Mahrattas to be an incarnation of the elephant
headed god Gunputty. That celebrated deity was first
made flesh about the year 1640 in the person of a
Brahman of Poona, by name Mooraba Gosseyn, who
sought to work out his salvation by abstinence, mortifi
cation, and prayer. His piety had its reward. The
god himself appeared to him in a vision of the night
and promised that a portion of his, that is, of Gunputty 's,

holy spirit should abide with him and with his seed
after him even to the seventh generation. The divine
promise was fulfilled. Seven successive incarnations,
transmitted from father to son, manifested the light of
Gunputty to a dark world. The last of the direct line,
a heavy-looking god with very weak eyes, died in the year 1 8 1 o. But the cause of truth was too sacred, and
the value of the church property too considerable, to
allow the Brahmans to contemplate with equanimity
the unspeakable loss that would be sustained by a
world which knew not Gunputty. Accordingly they sought and found a holy vessel in whom the divine
spirit of the Master had revealed itself anew, and
the revelation has been happily continued in an un
broken succession of vessels from that time to this.
But a mysterious law of spiritual economy, whose
operation in the history of religion we may deplore though we cannot alter, has decreed that the miracles
performed by the god-man in these later days cannot
compare with those which were wrought by his pre
decessors in days gone by ; and it is even reported
that the only sign now vouchsafed by him is the miracle
of feeding the multitude, whom he annually entertains
to dinner at Chinchvad. 1 To be exact, I should say
that I have no information as to this particular deity
later than the account of him in the eighteenth volume

of the Bombay Gazetteer, published some twenty years ago. But I think we may assume that the same
providential reasons which prolonged the revelation
down to the publication of the Gazetteer have continued
it to the present day.
We are all familiar with the great incarnate god of
Lhassa, the Dalai Lama, who has lately fallen from his
high estate before the carnal weapons of his Majesty's
troops. In the year 1661 or 1662 Fathers Grueber
and d'Orville, on their return from Peking to Europe,
spent two months at Lhassa, waiting for a caravan, and
they report that the Grand Lama was worshipped as a
true and living god, that he received the title of the
Eternal and Heavenly Father, and that he was believed
to have risen from the dead not once but seven times.
He lived withdrawn from the business of this passing
world in the recesses of his palace, where, seated aloft
on a cushion and precious carpets, he received the homage
of his adorers in a chamber screened from the garish eye
of day, but glittering with gold and silver, and lit up
by the blaze of a multitude of torches. 1
But he is by no means the only man who poses as a
god in these regions. A register of all the incarnate
gods in the Chinese Empire is kept in the Li fan yuan
or Colonial Office at Peking. The number of gods
who have thus taken out a license is one hundred and
sixty. Tibet rejoices in thirty of them, and northern
Mongolia in nineteen, while southern Mongolia is

Government, with a paternal solicitude for the welfare

reborn anywhere but in Tibet. They fear lest the
birth of a god in Mongolia should have serious political
consequences by stirring the dormant patriotism and
warlike spirit of the Mongols, who might rally round
an ambitious native deity of royal lineage, and might seek to win for him, at the point of the sword, a
temporal as well as a spiritual kingdom. But besides these public or licensed gods, there are a great many
little private gods, or unlicensed practitioners of divinity, who work miracles and bless their people in holes and
corners ; and of late years the Chinese Government has
winked at the rebirth of these pettifogging deities out
side of Tibet. However, once they are born the
Government keeps its eye on them as well as on the
regular practitioners, and if any of them misbehaves, he
is promptly degraded, banished to a distant monastery, and strictly forbidden ever to be born again in the flesh. 1
At the head of Taoism, the most numerous religious
sect of China, is a pope who goes by the name of the
Heavenly Master, and is believed to be an incarnation
and representative on earth of the god of heaven. His
official title is Chen-yen, or " the True Man." When
one of these pontiffs or incarnate deities departs this
life, his soul passes into a male member of his family,

the ancient house of Chang. In order to determine his
successor, all the male members of the clan assemble at
the palace, their names are engraved on tablets of lead,
the tablets are thrown into a vessel full of water, and
the one which bears the name of the new incarnation
floats on the surface. The reputation and power of the
pope are very great. He lives in princely style at his palace on the Dragon and Tiger mountains in the pro
vince of Kiang-si, about twenty-five miles to the south
west of Kuei-ki. The road, which is provided at
regular intervals with stone halls for the repose of weary
pilgrims, leads gradually upward through a bleak and
barren district, treeless and thinly peopled, to the
summit of a pass, from which a beautiful prospect
suddenly opens up of a wide and fertile valley watered
by a little stream. The scene charms the traveller all
the more by contrast with the desert country which he
has just traversed. This is the beginning of the pope's
patrimony, which he holds from the emperor free of
taxes. The palace stands in the middle of a small town.
It is new and of no special interest, having been rebuilt
after the Taiping rebellion. For in their march north
ward the rebels devastated the papal domains with great
fury. About a mile to the east of the palace lie the
ruins of stately temples, which also perished in the great
rising and have only in part been rebuilt. However,
the principal temple is well preserved. It is dedicated to the god of heaven, and contains a colossal image of
that deity. The papal residence naturally swarms with
monks and priests of all ranks. But the courts and



v THE TAQIST POPE 145
gardens of the monasteries, littered with heaps of
broken bricks and stones and mouldering wood,
present a melancholy spectacle of decay. And the
ruinous state of the religious capital reflects the decline
of the papacy. The number of pilgrims has fallen off,
and with them the revenues of the holy see. Formerly
the pope ranked with viceroys and the highest dignitaries of the empire : now he is reduced to the level of a man
darin of the third class, and wears a blue button instead of
a red. Formerly he repaired every year to the imperial court at Peking or elsewhere in order to procure peace and
prosperity for the whole kingdom by means of his cere
monies ; and on his journey the gods and spirits were
bound to come from every quarter to pay him homage,
unless he considerately hung out on his palanquin a
board with the notice, " You need not trouble to
salute." The people, too, gathered up the dust or mud
from under his feet to preserve it as a priceless talisman.
Nowadays, if he goes to court at all, it seems to be not
oftener than once in three years ; and his services are
seldom wanted except to ban the demons of plague.
But he still exercises the right of elevating deceased
mandarins to the rank of local deities, and as he gets a
fee for every deification, the ranks of the celestial hier
archy naturally receive many recruits. He also draws
a considerable revenue from the manufacture and sale of
red and green papers inscribed with cabalistic characters,
which are infallible safeguards against demons, disease,
and calamities of every kind. 1

146 THE CHINESE EMPEROR LECT.
However, in China the greatest of all human gods
is the emperor. As to the position which he occupies in the minds of the people, I will quote the words of
Professor J. J. M. de Groot, of Leyden, the most
eminent living authority, I believe, on Chinese religion. He says : " To no son of China would it ever occur to
question the supreme power wielded by the emperor and his proxies, the mandarins, not only over mankind,
but also over the gods. For the gods or shen are souls
of intrinsically the same nature as those existing in
human beings ; why then, simply because they have no
human bodies, should they be placed above the emperor,
who is no less than a son of Heaven, that is to say, a
magnitude second to none but Heaven or the Power
above whom there is none who governs the universe
and all that moves and exists therein ? Such absurdity
could not possibly be entertained by Chinese reason.
So it is a first article of China's political creed that the
emperor, as well as Heaven, is lord and master of all
the gods, and delegates this dignity to his mandarins,
each in his jurisdiction. With them then rests the
decision which of the gods are entitled to receive the
people's worship, and which are not. It is the imperial government which deifies disembodied souls of men,
and also divests them of their divine rank. Their
worship, if established against its will or without its
consent, can be exterminated at its pleasure, without

revenge having to be feared from the side of the god
for any such radical measure ; for the power of even the
mightiest and strongest god is as naught compared with that of the august Celestial Being with whose will and
under whose protection the Son [that is, the Emperor]
reigns supreme over everything existing below the
empyrean, unless he forfeits this omnipotent support
through neglect of his imperial duties." l As the emperor of China is believed to be a Son of
Heaven, so the emperor of Japan, the Mikado, is sup
posed to be an incarnation of the sun goddess, the
deity who rules the universe, gods and men included.
Once a year all the gods wait upon him and spend a
month at his court. During that month, the name of
which means "without gods,'* no one frequents the
temples, for they are believed to be deserted.1
The early Babylonian kings, from the time of Sargon I. till the fourth dynasty of Ur or later, claimed to be
gods in their lifetime. The monarchs of the fourth
dynasty of Ur in particular had temples built in their honour : they set up their statues in various sanctuaries
and commanded the people to sacrifice to them : the
eighth month was especially dedicated to the kings,
and sacrifices were offered to them at the new moon
and on the fifteenth day of each month. 8

148 KINGS OF EGTFF LECT.
The ancient kings of Egypt also were worshipped
as gods in their lifetime. On this subject the late
Sir Peter le Page Renouf says : " It has never been
doubted that the king claimed actual divinity ; he was
the c
great god,' the ' golden Horus/ and son of Ra [the
sun-god]. He claimed authority not only over Egypt, but over * all lands and nations/ * the whole world in
its length and its breadth, the east and the west/ * the
entire compass of the great circuit of the sun/ ' the sky
and what is in it, the earth and all that is upon it/
1 every creature that walks upon two or upon four legs,
all that fly or flutter, the whole world offers her pro
ductions to him/ Whatever in fact might be asserted
of the sun-god was dogmatically predicable of the
king of Egypt. His titles were directly derived from
those of the sun -god." l To quote now a recent
French writer who has devoted a special treatise
to the investigation of the sacred character of the
Egyptian kings. " In the course of his existence,"
says M. Moret, " the king of Egypt exhausted all the
possible conceptions of divinity which the Egyptians
had framed for themselves. A superhuman god by
his birth and by his royal office, he became the deified
man after his death. Thus all that was known of the
divine was summed up in him." 2 " The divinity of

the king was recognised in all the circumstances of the
public life of the sovereign. It was not enough to worship Pharaoh in the temple ; beyond the limits of
the sanctuary he remained the c good god
' to whom all
men owed a perpetual adoration. The very name of
the sovereign was sacred like his person ; people swore
by his name as by that of the gods, and he who took
the oath in vain was punished." l In particular, the
king of Egypt was identified with the great sun-god
Ra. " Son of the sun, decked with the solar crowns,
armed with the solar weapons, gods and men adored
him as Ra, defended him as Ra from the attacks which
menaced in him the divine being who, in his human
existence, knew the glory and the dangers of being ' an
incarnate sun ' and ' the living image on earth of his
father Turn of Heliopolis.'
" 2 Even the life of the
gods depended on the divine life of the king. Gods
and men, it was said, " live by the words of his mouth." 8
" O gods/' said the king before celebrating divine
worship, " you are safe if I am safe. Your doubles
are safe if my double is safe at the head of all living
doubles. All live if I live." 4
We have now completed our sketch, for it is no
more than a sketch, of the evolution of that sacred
kingship which attained its highest form, its most
absolute expression, in the monarchies of Peru and
Egypt, of China and Japan. Historically, the institu

150 EVOLUTION OF KINGSHIP LECT.
tion appears to have originated in the order of public
magicians or medicine-men : logically, it rests on a
mistaken deduction from the association of ideas. Men
mistook the order of their ideas for the order of nature,
and hence imagined that the control which they have,
or seem to have, over their thoughts, permitted them
to exercise a corresponding control over things. The
men who for one reason or another, on the ground of
the strength or the weakness of their natural parts,
were supposed to possess these magical powers in the
highest degree, were gradually marked off from their fellows and became a separate class, who were destined
to exercise a most far-reaching influence on the political,
religious, and intellectual evolution of mankind. Social
progress, as we know, consists mainly in a successive
differentiation of functions, or, in simpler language,
a division of labour. The work which in primitive
society is done by all alike and by all equally ill, or
nearly so, is gradually distributed among different
classes of workers and executed more and more per
fectly ; and so far as the products, material or im
material, of this specialised labour are shared by all, the
whole community benefits by the increasing specialisation. Now magicians or medicine-men appear to con
stitute the oldest artificial or professional class in the
evolution of society.

v EVOL UTION OF KINGSHIP 1 5 1
savage tribe known to us ; and among the lowest
savages, such as the Australian aborigines, they are the
only artificial class that exists. As time goes on, and
the process of differentiation continues, the order of
medicine-men is itself subdivided into such classes as
the healers of disease, the makers of rain, and so forth ;
while the most powerful member of the order wins for
himself a position as chief and gradually develops into a sacred king, his old magical functions falling more
and more into the background and being exchanged for
priestly or even divine duties, in proportion as magic is
slowly ousted by religion. Still later, a partition is effected between the civil and the religious aspect of the
kingship, the temporal power being committed to one man and the spiritual to another. Meanwhile the
magicians, who may be repressed but are never extirpated
by the predominance of religion, still addict themselves
to their old occult arts in preference to the newer ritual
of sacrifice and prayer ; and in time the more sagacious
of their number perceive the fallacy of magic and hit
upon a more effectual mode of manipulating the forces
of nature for the benefit of man ; in short, they abandon
sorcery for science. I am far from affirming that the
course of development has everywhere rigidly followed these lines : it has doubtless varied greatly in different
societies : I merely mean to indicate in the broadest
outline what I conceive to have been its general trend.
Regarded from the industrial point of view, the evolution
has been from uniformity to diversity of function :
regarded from the political point of view, it has been

from democracy to despotism. With the later history
of monarchy, especially with the decay of despotism and
its displacement by forms of government better adapted to the higher needs of humanity, we are not concerned
in these lectures : our subject is the growth, not the
decline, of a great and, in its time, beneficent institution.
But if we have thus traced in outline the early history
of the kingship, we have still to fill in the details. To
do so fully would far exceed not only the time at our
disposal but my knowledge and abilities. The task
will need the co-operation of many workers. The
materials for the history have still in large measure to
be collected, sifted, and arranged. In what remains of
these lectures I shall confine myself to putting before
you some special aspects of the kingship, particularly of
the kingship in classical antiquity. You will remember that we began our inquiry by
considering an individual instance of a sacred king,
namely, the priest of Diana, known as the King of the
Wood, at Nemi. I said that apart from the greater
definiteness and precision attained by starting from
concrete facts rather than from general ideas, the priest
hood of Nemi offers some special advantages, because it
raises certain questions of great interest, which will
repay investigation. I propose therefore to reconduct you to Nerni for a few minutes before starting on
another, though much more narrowly limited, tour of
observation.
A review of the classical evidence alone, without any



v IN RELATION TO DIANA 153
application of the comparative method in the wider sense, led us to conclude that the priest of Diana at
Nemi represented in the flesh a certain mysterious
mythical being named Virbius, who was said to have
been the first King of the Wood, and to have been to
Diana what Attis was to Cybele or Adonis to Venus.
From this it seems necessarily to follow that the priest
himself, as the representative of Virbius, stood in the
very same relation to the goddess, and as the relation
was that of a mortal lover to an immortal goddess,
we conclude that the priest was regarded as the mate
or consort of Diana.
Now our survey of divine kings and other human
incarnations of deities has probably prepared you to
admit that the King of the Wood at Nemi may well
have been something more than a mere priest, that he
may have been supposed to embody, as well as to
represent, the mythical being Virbius ; in short, that
he may have posed as a god as well as a king, and that
his predecessors may have attained to that exalted
position by the exercise of those magical functions which
have so often paved the way to kingship and godhead. If that were so, he would be no unsuitable mate for a
goddess. Now Diana at Nemi was called the Lady of
the Woods (Nemorensis), while her priest bore the title
of Lord or King of the Wood (Rex Nemorensis). When we take this into consideration along with the
story of Virbius and his representation by the priest,
we seem justified in inferring that the priest and the
goddess passed in popular estimation for a loving



154 PERSONIFICATION OF TREES LECT.
couple, the King and Queen, or Lord and Lady of the Woods.
At this point I would remind you that the priest of
Nemi not only bore a title which connected him with
the woods in general or at least with the sacred grove
in particular, but that, further, he stood in a peculiar
relation to one individual tree in the grove, since he
might only be attacked by a candidate for office who
had broken a bough from that tree. Taken together
with his sylvan title and his intimate association with the
goddess of the grove, this circumstance may perhaps, without undue straining, be interpreted to mean that
his life was in a manner bound up with that of the tree,
or to put it in another form, that he was a human
representative or incarnation of a tree-spirit. And in regard to his divine partner, Diana, so far as she was a
goddess of the woods, it is probable that she was the
lineal descendant of a tree-nymph ; for primitive man
ascribes an individual spirit, whether a nymph or a
faun, to each single tree long before he arrives at the
general conception of a god or goddess of the woods.
Now I am not going to inflict upon you a tedious
dissertation on tree-worship, but there is one side or
aspect of tree- worship to which I must direct your
attention, if we are fully to understand the King and
Queen of the Wood at Nemi. That side or aspect
is the personification of the spirits of trees and plants as
male and female respectively. Such a personification,
as you are no doubt aware, is not purely fanciful, for
plants as well as animals have their sexes. How far the



v AS MALE AND FEMALE 155
real distinction of male and female plants has been
observed by savages I am not prepared to say. It is asserted that the Maoris have observed it, and that they
have separate names for the different sexes of some
trees. 1 However that may be, it is certain that the
ancients had made the discovery : Pliny says that
naturalists distinguished the sexes of all trees and plants.
And they turned the discovery to practical account in
the cultivation of the date-palm by fertilising the tree
artificially.
2 Among the Sabaeans of Harran the month
during which the palms were thus fertilised bore the
name of the Date Month, and at this time they cele
brated the marriage festival of all the gods and
goddesses. 3 Many of you may have noticed in the
British Museum the great sculptured slabs from Assyria
on which a winged figure is represented standing in front of a tree and holding in his hand what looks like
a pine-cone. The scene has been ingeniously explained
by Professor E. B. Tylor as the artificial fertilisation
of the palm. 4
Different, however, from such true and fruitful
marriages of trees are the false and barren marriages
which have played a part in the popular superstitions of various lands. These latter are certainly to be attri

buted not to a perception of the truth that plants have
in fact their sexes, but merely to that primitive mode of
thought which leads ignorant people everywhere to extend by analogy the relations of human life to every
department of nature. These purely superstitious
marriages of plants are common in India. For example, if a Hindoo has planted a grove of mangos, neither he
nor his wife may taste of the fruit until he has formally
married one of the trees, as a bridegroom, to a tree ot
a different sort, commonly to a tamarind-tree, which
grows near it in the grove. If there is no tamarind to
act as a bride, a jasmine will serve the turn. The
expenses of such a marriage are often considerable, for
the more Brahmans are feasted at it the greater the
glory of the owner of the grove. A family has been
known to sell its golden and silver trinkets, and to
borrow all the money they could, in order to marry a
mango-tree to a jasmine with due pomp and ceremony. 1 Another plant which figures as a bride in Hindoo rites
is the tulasi or Holy Basil (Ocymum Sanctum). It is a
small shrub, not too big to be grown in a large flower
pot, and is often placed in rooms ; indeed, there is hardly
a respectable Hindoo family that does not possess one.
In spite of its humble appearance, the shrub is pervaded by the essence of the great god Vishnu and his wife
Lakshmi, and is itself worshipped daily as a deity. The
plant is especially a woman's divinity, being regarded as an embodiment of Vishnu's wife Lakshmi, or of Rama's
1 Sir W. H. Sleeman, Rambles and Recollections of an Indian Official (Westminster,
1893), i. 38*7.



v MARRIAGE OF PLANTS 157
wife Sita, or of Krishna's wife Rukmini. Women
worship it by walking round it and praying or offering
flowers and rice to it. Now this sacred plant, as the
embodiment of a goddess, is annually married to the
god Krishna in every Hindoo family. The ceremony takes place in November. In Western India they often
bring an idol of the youthful Krishna in a gorgeous
palanquin, followed by a long train of attendants, to the house of a rich man to be married to the basil ; and
the festivities are celebrated with great pomp. 1 Again,
as the wife of Vishnu, the holy basil is married to the
Salagrama, a black fossil ammonite resembling a ram's
horn, which is regarded as an embodiment of Vishnu.
In North-Western India this marriage of the plant to the
fossil has to be performed before it is lawful to taste of
the fruit of a new orchard. A man holding the fossil
personates the bridegroom, and another holding the
basil represents the bride. After burning a sacrificial
fire, the officiating Brahman puts the usual questions to
the couple about to be united. Bride and bridegroom
walk six times round a small spot marked out in the
centre of the orchard. 2 Further, no well is considered
lucky until the holy fossil has been solemnly wedded to

the holy basil, which stands for the garden that the
well is intended to water. The relations assemble ; the
owner of the garden represents the bridegroom, while a kinsman of his wife personates the bride. Gifts are
given to the Brahmans, a feast is held in the garden,
and after that both the garden and the well may be used
without danger.
1 In these customs I would ask you
to note particularly the personation of the plant by a
human being. The principle of that personation has
been widely applied, and, if I am right, goes far to
explain the priesthood of Nemi. The same marriage of the sacred fossil to the sacred
plant is celebrated annually by the Rajah of Orchha at
Ludhaura. A former Rajah used to spend a sum equal
to about thirty thousand pounds, being one-fourth of
his revenue, on the ceremony. On one occasion over a
hundred thousand people are said to have been present
at the rite, and to have been feasted at the expense of
the Rajah. The procession consisted of eight elephants, twelve hundred camels, and four thousand horses, all
mounted and elegantly caparisoned. The most sumptuously decorated of the elephants carried the fossil god
to pay hislbridal visit to the little shrub goddess. On
such an occasion all the rites of a regular marriage are
performed, and afterwards the newly-wedded pair
are left to repose together in the temple till the next
year.

vegetation still survives in the ceremonies of May Day ;
for the King and Queen of May undoubtedly personify
the reawakening energies of trees and flowers, of woods

IN the last lecture we concluded our survey of what we
may call the King's Progress, I mean the process by which the divine king has been gradually evolved out
of the old magician or medicine-man. The general
notion which we have thus gained of the evolution of
the sacred kingship may now be applied to the particular instance of that institution from which we started in the
first lecture. The title of the King of the Wood,
bestowed on the priest of Nemi, along with his relation
to the woodland goddess Diana, suggest that the two
together personified the powers of vegetation in general and of the woods in particular, and that their union may,
on the principles of homoeopathic magic, have been regarded as a means to ensure the reproduction of that
plant life on which, in the last resort, both men and
animals depend for their subsistence. Customs of the
same sort survive in an attenuated form in the rites
which are still observed in some parts of Europe at
160



LECT. vi MARRIAGE OF PLANTS 161
the popular festivals of May Day, Whitsuntide, and
Midsummer. In all these customs the essence of the
rite appears to be a mimic marriage of the powers of
vegetation, who after their long winter sleep manifest
their renewed activity in the bursting green of the trees
and the varied hues of the opening flowers. And we
should fail to understand the meaning of the pageant if
we regarded it merely as a dramatic representation of
the great change that takes place on earth in spring and
early summer. Our study of sympathetic magic, and
especially of its imitative branch, has prepared us to
believe that in its origin, though certainly not at the
present time, the mimic marriage of the powers of
vegetation, whether represented by trees or leaf-clad
mummers, was a magical ceremony, a charm designed to bring about the result which it simulated ; in other
words, that it was intended to quicken the growth of
leaves and blossoms, of grass and flowers, and of the
fruits of the earth in general.
I shall not detain you with a long description of
these ceremonies, but shall merely give you as samples
a few instances which have come to my knowledge
within the last few years. But there are some general
features of the rites which it is important to apprehend
because they bear directly on the worship of Nemi, if
my view of that worship is correct. First, then, the
human representatives of vegetation are often treated
and spoken of as kings and queens ; second, the claim
to these mock kingships is often determined by a contest
of physical strength or agility ; and thirdly, the real or



1 62 MAT-TREES IN GERMANY LECT.
pretended union of the human King and Queen of May
would seem to have been originally an essential part of
the rite, being regarded as a sympathetic charm to
promote, on the principle of imitation or homoeopathy, the fertility of the woods, the meadows, and the fields.
Thus the license which is known to have attended these
customs in the past was not an accidental excess, but on
the contrary was probably regarded as an indispensable
feature of the ceremonies, if they were really to produce
the intended result.
With these explanations you will be able to under
stand the very serious meaning which these apparently
gay frivolous festivals had for our forefathers : life must
have been thought to depend on their performance, and death, universal death, to follow their omission. For
how could men and beasts live if there should be spring
no more ?
To take now a few examples of these customs. A
German writer thus describes the May and Whitsuntide
festivals, as they used to be held in Saxony. He says
that " people were not content with bringing the
summer symbolically (as king or queen) into the
village ; they brought the fresh green itself from the woods even into the houses : that is the May or Whit
suntide trees, which are mentioned in documents from
the thirteenth century onwards. The fetching in of
the May-tree was a festival. The people went out into
the woods to seek the May (majum quaerere), brought
young trees, especially firs and birches, to the village,
and set them up before the doors of the houses or of



vi MAT-TREES IN GERMANT 163
the cattle-stalls or in the rooms. Young fellows erected
May-trees before the chambers of their sweethearts.
Besides these household Mays, a great May-tree or
May-pole, which had also been brought in solemn pro
cession to the village, was set up in the middle of the
village or in the market-place of the town. It had
been chosen by the whole community, who watched
over it most carefully. Generally the tree was stripped of its branches and leaves, nothing but the crown being
left, on which were displayed, in addition to many
coloured ribbons and cloths, a variety of victuals such
as sausages, calces, and eggs. The young folk exerted
themselves to obtain these prizes. In the greasy poles
which are still to be seen at our fairs we have a relic of
these old May-poles. Not uncommonly there was a
race on foot or on horseback to the May-tree a Whit
suntide pastime which in course of time has been divested
of its goal and survives as a popular custom to this day
in many parts of Germany. In the great towns of our
land the custom has developed into sport, for our spring
races are in their origin nothing but the old German
horse-races, in which the victor received a prize (gener
ally a red cloth) from the hand of a maiden, while the
last rider was greeted with jeers and gibes by the
assembled community." * The custom of the May-tree is observed by the
Wends of Saxony, as well as by the Germans. The
young men of the village choose the slimmest and
tallest tree of the wood, peel it and set it up on the

village green. Its leafy top is decked with cloths and
ribbons presented by the girls. Here it stands, tower
ing high above the roofs, till Ascension Day, or in many
places till Whitsuntide. When it is being taken down,
the young folk dance round it, and the youth who
catches and breaks off the leafy crown of the falling tree
is the hero of the day. Holding the green boughs aloft
he is carried shoulder-high, with music and joyous
shouts, to the ale-house, where the dance is resumed. 1
A regular feature in the popular celebration of Whit
suntide in Silesia used to be, and to some extent still is,
the contest for the kingship. This contest took various
forms, but the mark or goal was generally the May-tree
or May-pole. Sometimes the youth who succeeded in
climbing the smooth pole and bringing down the prize was proclaimed the Whitsuntide King and his sweet
heart the Whitsuntide Bride. Afterwards, the king,
carrying the May-bush, repaired with the rest of the company to the ale-house, where a dance and a feast
ended the merry-making. Often the young farmers
and labourers raced on horseback to the May-pole,
which was adorned with flowers, ribbons, and a crown.
He who first reached the pole was the Whitsuntide
King, and the rest had to obey his orders for that day.
The worst rider became the clown. At the May-tree
all dismounted and hoisted the king on their shoulders.
He nimbly swarmed up the pole and brought down the
May-bush and the crown, which had been fastened to
the top. Meantime the clown hurried to the ale-house
1 M. Rentsch, in R. Wuttke's op. cit. p. 359.



vi IN GERMANY 165
and proceeded to bolt thirty rolls of bread and to swig
four quart bottles of brandy with the utmost despatch.
He was followed by the king, who bore the May-bush
and crown at the head of the company. If on their
arrival the clown had already disposed of the rolls and
the brandy, and greeted the king with a speech and a glass of beer, his score was paid by the king, otherwise
he had to settle it himself. After church time the pro
cession wound through the village. At the head of it
rode the king, decked with flowers and carrying the
May-bush. Next came the clown with his clothes
turned inside out, a great flaxen beard on his chin, and
the Whitsuntide crown on his head. Two riders
disguised as guards followed. The procession drew up
before every farmyard : the two guards dismounted,
shut the clown into the house, and claimed a contribution
from the housewife to buy soap with which to wash the
clown's beard. Custom allowed them to carry off any
victuals which were not under lock and key. Last of
all they came to the house in which the king's sweet
heart lived. She was greeted as Whitsuntide Queen
and received suitable presents. The king had the right
of setting up the May-bush or Whitsuntide tree before
his master's yard, where it remained as an honourable
token till the same day next year. Finally the procession
took its way to the tavern, where the king and queen
opened the dance. 1
In this last custom the part played by the clown is

not quite clear. You will observe that it is he, and
not the king, who wears the crown. I conjecture that
in former times a burlesque execution may have formed
part of the pageant, and that the clown may have been
the victim. Such executions have been not uncommon
at these ceremonies. The following example will
illustrate them. Sometimes in Silesia the Whitsuntide
King and Queen succeeded to office as follows. A man
of straw, as large as life and crowned with a red cap,
was conveyed in a cart, between two men armed and
disguised as guards, to a place where a mock court was
waiting to try him. A great crowd followed the cart.
After a formal trial the straw man was condemned to
death and fastened to a stake on the execution ground.
The young men with bandaged eyes tried to stab him
with a spear. He who succeeded became king, and his
sweetheart queen. The straw man was known as the
Goliath. 1 Such burlesque executions have, if my theory
is right, a close bearing on the King of the Wood
at Nemi, who succeeded to office by slaying his
predecessor in grim earnest. The ancient May Day ceremonies are still observed in
some villages of South Warwickshire, as I learned last
autumn during a visit to that charming country, where
the pretty customs are fittingly framed in scenes of rural
beauty that seem still to reflect the England of the olden
time. Thus at the adjoining villages of Cherrington and Stourton the Queen of May is represented by a small
girl dressed in white and wearing a wreath of flowers
1 P. Drechsler, cp. cit. \. 129.



vi THE MAT QUEEN 167
on her head. An older girl wheels the queen in a
child's perambulator on two wheels. Four boys bear
the May-pole. This is a conical framework formed of
a high tripod with a central shaft. The whole structure
is encased in a series of five hoops, which rise one
above the other, diminishing in size upward with the
tapering of the cone. The hoops, as well as the tripod
and the central shaft, are all covered with whatever
flowers happen to be in bloom, such as marsh
marigolds, primroses, or blue-bells. To the top of the
central shaft is fastened a bunch of the flower called
crown-imperial, if it is in season. The lowest hoop is
crossed by two bars at right angles to each other and
the projecting ends of the bars serve as handles by
which the four boys carry the flower-decked structure.
Each of the bearers has a garland of flowers slung
round his shoulder. Thus the children go from house
to house singing their songs and receiving money, which goes to provide a treat for them in the after
noon. 1 The so-called May-pole in this custom bears
so close a resemblance to the leafy framework in which
our Jack-in-the-Green and other springtide mummers walk encased that perhaps it too originally concealed a
mummer, whether the King or Queen of May.
You will have noticed that in this ceremony, though
the Queen of May figures, her consort the king does
not. Both, however, appear at Halford, another village of South Warwickshire. Here the children

go from house to house on May Day, walking two and
two in procession and headed by a king and queen.
Two boys carry a May-pole some six or seven feet
high, which is covered with flowers and greenery.
Fastened to it near the top are two cross-bars at right
angles to each other. These are also decked with
flowers, and from the ends of the bars hang hoops
similarly adorned. At the houses the children sing
May songs and receive money, which is used to
provide tea for them at the schoolhouse in the
afternoon. 1
Ceremonies of this sort have played a great part in
the popular festivals of Europe, and based as they are
on a very crude conception of natural law, it is clear
that they must have been handed down from a remote
antiquity. We shall hardly err in assuming that they date from a time when the forefathers of the civilised
nations of Europe were still barbarians, herding their
cattle and cultivating patches of corn in the clearings of the vast forests, which then covered the greater part
of the Continent from the Mediterranean to the Arctic
Ocean. But if these old spells and enchantments for
the growth of leaves and blossoms, of grass and flowers
and fruit, have lingered down to our own time in the
shape of pastoral plays and popular merrymakings, is it not reasonable to suppose that they survived in less
attenuated forms some two thousand years ago among
the civilised peoples of antiquity ? Or, to put it other
wise, is it not likely that in certain festivals of the
1 From information given me by Miss A. Wyse, of Halford.



vi THE SACKED MARRIAGE 169
ancients we may be able to detect the equivalents of
our May Day, Whitsuntide, and Midsummer celebra
tions, with this difference, that in those days the
ceremonies had not yet dwindled into mere shows and
pageants, but were still religious or magical rites, in
which the actors consciously supported the high parts
of gods and goddesses ? I conjecture that a sacred marriage of this sort may
have been annually celebrated at Nemi between the
King of the Wood and his divine Queen the goddess
Diana for the purpose of promoting the growth of vegetation. Direct evidence that this was so there is
none, but analogy pleads in its favour, as I shall now endeavour to show.
You will observe that on my hypothesis the mortal
King of the Wood was married to an immortal god
dess, Diana. To us nowadays such a union appears on
the face of it absurd and impossible ; but it was not so
with the ancients. They sincerely believed that the
marriage of a divine with a human being was not only
possible but had often taken place : many persons in antiquity claimed to be direct descendants of gods.
The facts are too familiar to you all to require that I
should dwell upon them. I will only remark in pass
ing, because it is germane to our subject, that in ancient
Greece kings appear especially to have prided them
selves on their divine origin. We have seen that the
Spartan kings were believed to be descended from the
supreme god Zeus ; and in this respect apparently they did not differ from other kings, for in Homer a



i yo THE WIFE OF BEL LECT.
standing epithet of a king is " Zeus-born." But what
I am here concerned to prove is that beliefs of this
sort were actually embodied in religious ritual ; in
other words, that the marriage of the gods with human
beings was often celebrated with great solemnity.
To take some instances of these ritual marriages.
At Babylon the imposing sanctuary of the great god Bel rose like a pyramid above the city in a series of
eight towers or stories, planted one on the top of the
other. On the highest tower, reached by an ascent
which wound about all the rest, there stood a spacious
temple, and in the temple a great couch, magnificently
draped and cushioned, with a golden table beside it.
In the temple no image was to be seen, and no human
being passed the night there, save a single woman, whom, according to the Chaldaean priests, the god
chose from among all the women of Babylon. They
said that the deity himself entered the temple by night
and slept on the couch ; and the woman, as the consort
of the god, might not be married to a man. 1 As Bel
at Babylon was identified with Marduk, the chief god
of the city,
2 the woman who acted as his consort was
doubtless one of the " wives of Marduk " who
are mentioned in the recently discovered code of
Hammurabi. 3

(S. A. Cook, The Laws of Moses and the Code of Hammurabi, London, 1903, p. 148).



vi THE WIFE OF AMMON 171
At Calah, which was for some time the capital of
Assyria before it was displaced by Nineveh, the
marriage of the god Nabu appears to have been
annually celebrated on the third day of an Assyrian
month, lyyar or Airu, which corresponded to our May.
The ceremonies are minutely described in a liturgical
text, and from the description we gather that the
officiating priestess was married to the image of the
god. The image also went in procession to a grove, riding in a chariot beside the charioteer. 1
At Thebes in Egypt a woman slept in the temple
of Ammon as the consort of the god.2 In Egyptian
texts she is often mentioned as " the divine consort,"
and usually she was no less a personage than the Queen
of Egypt herself. For, according to the Egyptians, their monarchs were in the most literal sense the sons
of the god Ammon, who at the marriage of the royal
pair was supposed to assume for the time being the
form of the reigning king. The divine union of the
Queen of Egypt with the god is carved and painted in
great detail on the walls of two of the oldest temples
in Egypt, those of Luxor and Deir el Bahari ; and the
inscriptions attached to the paintings leave no doubt as
to the meaning of the scenes. And the birth of the
divine child, the fruit of the miraculous union, is
represented in equal detail. We may fairly assume,

with some eminent authorities, including Professor
Maspero, that the ceremonies of the marriage and
nativity of the Pharaohs, thus emblazoned on the walls
of Egyptian temples, were copied from the life ; in other words, that the carved and painted scenes re
present a real drama, which was acted by men and
women disguised as gods and goddesses whenever the
King and Queen of Egypt were married, or the queen
was about to give birth to an heir. " Here, as else
where in Egypt," says Professor Maspero, "sculptor
and painter did nothing but faithfully imitate reality.
Theory required that the assimilation of the kings
to the gods should be complete, so that every act of
the royal life was, as it were, a tracing of the corre
sponding act of the divine life. From the moment that
the king was Ammon, he wore the costume and badges
of Ammon the tall hat with the long plumes, the
cross of life, the greyhound-headed sceptre, and thus
arrayed he presented himself before the queen to
celebrate his marriage. The assistants also assumed
the costume and appearance of the divinities whom
they incarnated : the men put on masks of jackals,
hawks, and crocodiles, while the women donned masks
of cows or frogs, according as they played the parts of
Anubis, Khnoumou, Sovkou, Hathor, or Hiqit ; and
I am disposed to believe that the doubles of the new
born child were represented by as many puppets as were required by the ceremonies. Some of the rites
were complicated, and must have tired excessively the mother and child who underwent them ; but they

are nothing to those that have been observed in similar
circumstances in other lands. In general, we are bound
to hold that all the pictures traced on the walls of the
temples, in which the person of the king is concerned,
correspond to a real action in which disguised person
ages played the part of gods." To pass now from the East to Greek lands, Apollo
was said to spend the winter months at Patara in Lycia ;
and so long as he stayed there, his prophetess was shut
up with him in the temple every night, probably because she was supposed to be his wife. 2 At Ephesus
there was a college of sacred men called Essenes or
King Bees, who held office for a year, during which
they were bound to remain celibate and to observe
other rules of ceremonial purity.
8 Perhaps they were deemed the husbands of Artemis, more familiarly
known to us as Diana, of Ephesus, the great goddess
of fertility, whose association with the bee is vouched
for by the figures of bees which appear commonly both on her statues and on the coins of Ephesus. If
this conjecture is right, the King Bees and their bee

goddess Artemis at Ephesus would be closely parallel
to the King of the Wood and his woodland-goddess
Diana at Nemi, as these latter are interpreted by me.
The celibacy of the priests during their year of office
would be easily explicable on this hypothesis. As the consorts of the goddess they might have no human
wife.
At Athens the vine-god Dionysus was annually married to the queen, but we do not know whether
the part of the god in the ceremony was played by a man or an image. It would be natural to suppose
that the king himself personated the divine bride
groom, as his wife the queen personated the divine
bride ; but of this we have no evidence. The scene
of the marriage was the old official residence of the
king on the north-eastern slope of the Acropolis. 1 As
the building bore the name of the Cattle-stall, Miss
Harrison has ingeniously conjectured that Dionysus, who was often conceived by the Greek as a bull, may
have been represented as a bull at his marriage. 2 In
that case the part of the bridegroom might be played
by a man wearing a bull's head, just as in Egypt at
similar rites the sacred animals were represented by
men and women wearing the masks of cows, hawks,

vi TO THE QUEEN OF ATHENS 175
crocodiles, and so forth. The legend of Pasiphae and
the Minotaur suggests that the custom of marrying
a queen to a bull-god, that is to a man disguised as a bull, may not have been confined to Athens. 1
Whether that was so or not, the ceremony of wedding
the Queen of Athens to the vine-god must certainly have been intended to ensure the fertility of the vines
and other fruit-trees, of which Dionysus was the god.
Thus both in form and in meaning the rite would
answer to the nuptials of the King and Queen of May.
If at Athens, and probably elsewhere, the vine-god
was annually married to a queen in order that the
vines might be loaded with clusters of green and purple
grapes, there is reason to think that a marriage of a
different kind, intended to make the fields wave with
yellow corn, was celebrated every year not many
miles off, beyond the low bare hills which bound the
plain of Athens on the west. In the great mysteries
solemnised at Eleusis in the month of September the
union of the sky-god Zeus with the corn-goddess
Demeter appears to have been represented by the
dramatic union of the hierophant with the priestess
of Demeter, who acted the parts of god and goddess
respectively. After a period of anxious suspense, the
hierophant reappeared and in a blaze of light silently exhibited to the assembled worshippers a reaped ear

of corn, the fruit of the divine marriage. Then in
a loud voice he proclaimed that the queen had been
delivered of a child. The corn-mother, in fact, had
given birth to the corn. This revelation of the reaped
ear seems to have been the crowning act of the
mysteries.
1 Thus through the glamour shed around
these rites by the poetry and philosophy of later ages
there still looms, like a distant landscape through a
sunlight haze, a simple rustic festival designed to cover
the wide Eleusinian plain with a plentiful harvest by
wedding the goddess of the corn to the sky-god, who fertilised the bare earth with genial showers.
But Zeus was not always the sky-god, nor was
he always married to the corn-goddess. If in antiquity
a traveller, quitting Eleusis and passing through miles
of olive-groves and cornfields, had climbed the pine
clad mountains of Cithasron and descended through
the forest on their northern slope to Plataea, he might
have chanced to find the people of that little Boeotian
town celebrating a different marriage of the great god
to a different goddess. On a certain day they went
into a primaeval oak-wood and set meat on the ground
at the foot of the giants of the forest. When a raven
was observed to swoop on the meat and carry it off" to

vi MARRIAGE OF ZEUS 177
an oak, the people followed it and cut down the tree.
With the wood of the tree they made an image,
dressed it as a bride, and placed it on a bullock-cart
with a bridesmaid beside it. Then it seems to have
been drawn to the river and back to the town attended
by a piping and dancing crowd. After the festival,
which was held every few years, the image was put
away and kept with others of the same sort till another
festival called the Great Daedala came round, which
was celebrated by all the people of Boeotia once in
every sixty years. On that occasion all the images that had accumulated at the lesser festivals were
dragged on wains to the top of Mount Cithaeron and
there burned in a huge bonfire, of which the blaze
could be seen for miles over the country. The legend
told to account for these festivals seems to show that
the ceremony represented the marriage of Zeus, the
oak god, to the goddess or nymph of the oak, who
was personated by the oaken image dressed as a bride. 1
Whether the part of Zeus at the marriage was acted
by a man or an image is not clear.
The sacred marriage of Zeus and Hera had, as was
natural, its counterpart in heathen times among the
northern kinsfolk of the Greeks. In Sweden every
year a life-size image of Frey, the god of fertility, both animal and vegetable, was drawn about the country in
a waggon attended by a beautiful girl who was called
the god's wife. She acted also as his priestess in his
great temple at Upsala. Wherever the waggon came

with the image of the god and his blooming young bride, the people crowded to meet them and offer
sacrifices for a fruitful year. 1
Similar ceremonies appear to have been observed by
the peasantry of Gaul in antiquity ; for Gregory of
Tours, writing in the sixth century of our era, says that
at Autun the people used to carry about an image of a
goddess in a waggon drawn by oxen. The intention of
the ceremony was to ensure the safety of the crops and
vines, and the rustics danced and sang in front of the
image. 2 The old historian identifies the goddess with
Cybele, the great Mother Goddess of Phrygia, and the
comparison, if not the identification, is just ; for the
rites of Cybele conformed closely to the type of the
sacred marriage here discussed. On the day of the
spring equinox (the 22nd of March) a pine-tree was
cut and brought into the sanctuary of the goddess,
where it was worshipped as a divinity. The effigy of
a young man, doubtless representing Attis, the consort
of Cybele, was attached to the tree, and the festival
ended with the drawing of the image of the goddess in
a bullock-cart to a brook, where it was bathed,8 perhaps
as a bride after her marriage. And the relation of the

Phrygian to the northern worship of a great goddess of
fertility was probably one not merely of similarity but of actual kinship, based on common descent ; for the
Phrygians were unquestionably an Aryan tribe who had crossed from Europe into Asia. At all events we may
make sure that the goddess whom the peasants of Gaul
carted about to bless their crops and their vines was of
native origin ; and we can hardly hesitate to see in
her and in Frey's wife the old French and Swedish
equivalents of the May Queen. It would be easy to show by a list of examples that
the custom of marrying a god or spirit to a woman has
been widespread in other parts of the world. Here I
shall content myself with observing that the deity who
is thus provided with a human bride is often a water
spirit. Thus, to take a few instances, the god of the
great Victoria Nyanza Lake in Central Africa was pro
pitiated by the Baganda every time they undertook a
long voyage, and they furnished him with girls to serve
as his wives. The custom lasted until King Mwanga
was converted to Christianity.
1 Again in one of the
states of Upper Burma there is a certain lake, the spirit
of which is regarded as very powerful and is propitiated
with offerings every year. A remarkable feature of the
worship of this spirit of the lake is the dedication to him
of four maidens in marriage. The custom was last
observed in 1893: the present chief has omitted it.
Soon after being wedded to the water-god, the girls are
allowed to return home. If nothing happens, the

spirit of the lake cares little for them ; but if one of
them dies, it is a sign that he loves her and has taken
her to himself. 1 Sometimes, apparently, it has not been
left to the discretion of the divine bridegroom to take
or leave his human bride : she has been made over to
him once for all in death. When the Arabs conquered
Egypt they learned that at the rise of the Nile the
Egyptians were wont to deck a young girl in gay apparel and throw her into the river as a sacrifice, in
order to obtain a plentiful inundation. The Arab
general abolished the barbarous custom. 2 The princes
of Koepang, a state in the East Indian island of
Timor, deemed themselves descended from crocodiles,
and on the coronation of a new prince a solemn
sacrifice was made to the crocodiles in presence of the
people. The offerings consisted of a pig with red
bristles and a young girl, prettily dressed, perfumed, and decked with flowers. She was taken down to the
bank of the river and set on a sacred stone in a cave.
Soon one of the reptiles appeared and dragged the girl
down into the water. The people thought that he
married her. 3 On festal occasions in the same state a
new-born girl was sometimes dedicated to a crocodile,
and then, with certain ceremonies of consecration, was

brought up to be married to a priest.
1 In this last
custom the priest perhaps represents a crocodile, and
the practice of marrying a girl to him may well be a humane mitigation of the older custom of exposing her
to the monster. It is said that once when the inhabit
ants of another East Indian island were threatened with
destruction by a swarm of crocodiles, they ascribed the
misfortune to a passion which the prince of the croco
diles had conceived for a certain girl. Accordingly they
compelled the damsel's father to dress her in bridal
array and deliver her over to the clutches of her croco
dile lover.8
A usage of the same sort is said to have prevailed in
the Maldive Islands before their conversion to Islam.
The famous Arab traveller Ibn Batutah has described
the custom and the manner in which it came to an
end. He was assured by several trustworthy natives,
whose names he gives, that when the people of the
islands were idolaters there appeared to them every
month an evil spirit among the jinn, who came from
across the sea in the likeness of a ship full of burning
lamps. The wont of the inhabitants, as soon as they
perceived him, was to take a young maiden, and having
adorned her, to lead her to a heathen temple that stood
on the shore, with a window looking out to sea. There
they left the damsel for the night, and when they came
back in the morning they found her dead. Every month
they drew lots, and he upon whom the lot fell gave up

his daughter to the spirit of the sea. This went on till
a Berber, who knew the Coran by heart, landed in the
islands and rescued the doomed maiden, like another
Andromeda, from the demon, whom he put to flight
by reciting passages of the holy book till break of day. After that the joyful people, freed from this tribute
to the cruel demon, embraced Islam. When Ibn
Batutah himself arrived in the islands, he knew nothing
of these things. One night as he was going about
his business, he heard of a sudden people saying in a
loud voice, " There is no God but God," and " God is
great." He saw children carrying copies of the Coran
on their heads, and women beating on basins and vessels
of copper. He was astonished at what they did, and
he said, " What has happened ? " They answered,
" Doest thou not behold the sea ? " He looked towards
the sea and beheld in the darkness as it were a great
ship full of burning lamps and cressets. They said to
him, " That is the demon. It is his wont to show him
self once a month ; but after we have done that which
thou hast seen, he returns to his place and does us no
manner of harm." l
It occurred to me that this myth of the demon lover
may have been based on some phenomenon of light
which is periodically visible at night in the Maldive
Islands. Accordingly I consulted our most eminent
authority on these islands, Mr. J. Stanley Gardiner of
Caius College. His answer confirmed my conjecture.

He wrote to me : "A peculiar phosphorescence, like
the glow of a lamp hidden by a roughened glass shade, is occasionally visible on lagoon shoals in the Maldives.
I imagine it to have been due to some single animal
with a greater phosphorescence than any at present
known to us. A periodical appearance at some phase
of the moon due to reproduction is not improbable, and
has parallels. The myth still exists in the Maldives,
but in a rather different form." He adds that "a
number of these animals might of course appear on
some shoal near Male," the principal island of the group.
To the eyes of the ignorant and superstitious such a
mysterious glow, suddenly lighting up the sea in the
dusk of the evening, might well appear a phantom ship,
hung with burning lamps, bearing down on the devoted islands, while the roar of the surf on the barrier reef
might sound in their ears like the voice of the demon
calling for his prey. Ibn Batutah's narrative of the demon lover and his
mortal bride closely resembles a well-known type of
folk-tale, of which versions have been found from Japan
and Annam in the East to Senegambia, Scandinavia,
and Scotland in the West. The story varies in
details from people to people, but as commonly told
it runs thus. A certain country is infested by a many
headed serpent, dragon, or other monster, which would
destroy the whole people if a human victim, generally
a virgin, were not delivered up to him periodically.
Many victims have perished, and at last it has fallen to
the lot of the king's own daughter to be sacrificed. She

is exposed to the monster, but the hero of the tale,
generally a young man of humble birth, interposes on her behalf, slays the beast, and receives the hand of the
princess and a share of the kingdom as his reward. In
many of the tales the monster, who is sometimes
described as a serpent, inhabits the water of a sea, a
lake, or a fountain. In other versions he is a serpent
or dragon who takes possession of the springs of water, and only allows the water to flow or the people
to make use of it on condition of receiving a human
victim. 1
It would probably be a mistake to dismiss all these
tales as pure inventions of the story-teller. Rather we
may suppose that they reflect a real custom of sacrificing girls or women to be the wives of water-spirits, who are
very often conceived as great serpents or dragons. 2 Among civilised peoples these customs survive for the
most part only in popular tales, of which the legend of
Perseus and Andromeda, with its mediaeval counterpart
of St. George and the Dragon, is the most familiar
example. But occasionally they appear to have left

This type of tale has been elaborately investigated by Mr. E. S. Hartland (The Legend of Perseus, London, 1894-1896) ; but while he illustrates the details of the story with a profusion of learning, he has not, so far as I have observed, dealt with the actual custom of
marrying women to supernatural beings, especially to water-spirits. More examples of it will be given in the third edition of The Golden Bough. 2 To the evidence collected in my note on Pausanias, ix. 10. 5, add H. Ternaux

traces of themselves in ceremonies and pageants. Thus
at Furth in Bavaria a drama called the Slaying of the
Dragon used to be acted every year about Midsummer,
on the Sunday after Corpus Christi Day. Crowds of
spectators flocked from the neighbourhood to witness
it. The scene of the performance was the public square.
On a platform stood or sat a princess wearing a golden crown on her head, and as many silver ornaments on
her body as could be borrowed for the purpose.
Opposite her was stationed the dragon, a dreadful
monster of painted canvas stretched on a wooden
skeleton and moved by two men inside. A knight in
armour rode forth and asked the princess why she
looked so sad. She told him that the dragon was
coming to eat her up. He bade her be of good cheer,
and attacked the dragon, thrusting his spear into its
maw and stabbing a bladder of bullock's blood which
was there concealed. The gush of blood which followed
was an indispensable part of the show ; the people
eagerly mopped it up, along with the blood -soaked
earth, in white cloths, which they afterwards laid on the
flax-fields, in order that the flax might thrive and grow
tall. For the " dragon's blood " was thought to be a
sure protection against witchcraft. Having despatched the dragon, the knight announced her deliverance to
the princess. She in return tied a wreath round his
arm and told him that her noble father and mother
would soon come to give them half the kingdom. 1 In

1 86 THE DRAGON OF ROUEN LECT.
this custom the use of the dragon's blood to make the
flax grow proves that the ceremony of the Slaying of
the Dragon was not a mere popular spectacle, but a
magical rite designed to fertilise the fields. As such it
probably descended from a very remote antiquity, and
may well have been invested with a character of
solemnity, if not of tragedy, long before it degenerated
into a farce.
More famous was the dragon from which, according
to legend, St. Remain delivered Rouen, and far more
impressive was the ceremony with which, down to the
French Revolution, the city commemorated its deliver
ance. The stately and beautiful edifices of the Middle
Ages, which still adorn Rouen, formed a fitting back
ground for a pageant which carried the mind back to
the days when Henry II. of England and Richard Cceur
de Lion, Dukes of Normandy, still had their palace in
this ancient capital of their ancestral domains. Legend
ran that about the year 520 A.D. a forest or marsh near
Rouen was infested by a monstrous beast in the shape
of a serpent or dragon, which every day wrought great
harm to the city and neighbourhood, devouring man and beast, causing boats and mariners on the river
Seine to perish, and inflicting other woes innumerable
on the commonwealth. At last the archbishop, St.
Romain, resolved to beard the monster in his den. He
could get none to accompany him but a prisoner con
demned to death for murder. On their approach the
dragon appeared as though he would swallow them up; but the archbishop, relying on the divine help, made the



vi THE DRAGON OF ROUEN 187
sign of the cross, and at once the monster became so
gentle that he suffered the saint to bind him with his
stole and the murderer to lead him like a lamb to the
slaughter. Thus they went in procession to a public
place in Rouen, where the dragon was peaceably burnt
in the presence of the people and its ashes cast into the
river. The murderer was pardoned for his services ;
and the fame of the deed having gone abroad, St.
Remain, or his successor St. Ouen, whose memory is
enshrined in a church of dream-like beauty at Rouen,
obtained from King Dagobert in perpetuity a privilege
for the archbishop, dean, and canons of the cathedral, to
wit, that every year on Ascension Day, the anniversary
of the miracle, they should pardon and release from
prison a malefactor, whomsoever they chose, and whatever the crime of which he had been guilty. This
privilege, unique in France, is known from documentary evidence to have been exercised from nearly the begin
ning of the thirteenth century down to 1790, when the
chapter intervened to stay the sword of justice for the
last time. Next year the face of things had changed :
there was neither archbishop nor chapter in Rouen. A
register of the prisoners who were pardoned, together with an account of their crimes, was kept, and still
exists. Most of the crimes appear to have been murder
or homicide.
The proceedings on the great day of pardon varied somewhat in different ages. The following account is
based in great part on a description written in the reign
of Henry III. and published at Rouen in 1587. On



1 88 PRIVILEGE OF ST. ROMAIN LECT.
the Monday of Rogations two canons examined the
prisoners and took their confessions, going from prison
to prison till Ascension Day. On that day, about seven
o'clock in the morning, all the canons assembled in the
chapter -house, and invoked the grace of the Holy
Spirit by the hymn Veni creator Spiritus and other
prayers. Also they made oath to reveal none of the
depositions of the criminals, but to hold them sacred
under the seal of confession. The depositions having
been taken and the commissioners heard, the chapter,
after due deliberaiton, named him or her among the
prisoners who was to receive the benefit of the privilege.
A card bearing the prisoner's name and sealed with the
seal of the chapter was then sent to the members of
parliament, who were sitting in full assembly, clad in
their red robes, in the great hall of the palace to receive
the nomination of the prisoner, and to give it legal
effect. The criminal was then released and pardoned.
Immediately the minster bells began to ring, the doors
of the cathedral were flung open, the organ pealed,
hymns were sung, candles lit, and every solemnity observed in token of joy and gladness. Then the
archbishop and all the clergy of the cathedral went in
procession to the great square known as the Old Tower
near the river, carrying the shrines and reliquaries of
the minster, and accompanied by the joyous music of
hautboys and clarions. In the square there stood, and
still stands, a platform of stone raised high above the
ground and approached by flights of steps. Thither
they brought the shrine (Jierte) of St. Romain, and



vi PRIVILEGE OF ST. ROMAIN 189
thither too was led the pardoned prisoner. He
ascended the platform, and after confessing his sins and
receiving absolution, he thrice lifted the shrine of St.
Romain, while the innumerable multitude assembled in
the square cried aloud, each time the shrine was lifted,
"Noel! Noel! Noel!" which was understood to mean
" God be with us !
" That done, the procession reformed and returned to the cathedral. At the head
walked a beadle clad in violet, who bore on a pole the
wicker effigy of the winged dragon of Notre Dame,
holding a large fish in its mouth. The whispers and
cries excited by the appearance of the monster were
drowned in the loud fanfares of cornets, clarions, and
trumpets. Behind the musicians, who wore the liveries
of the Master of the Brotherhood of Notre Dame with
his arms emblazoned on an ensign of taffeta, came the
carved silver -gilt shrine of Notre Dame. After it
followed the clergy of the cathedral to the number of
two hundred, clad in robes of violet or crimson silk,
bearing banners, crosses, and shrines, and chanting the
hymn De resurrectione Domini. Then came the arch
bishop, giving his blessing to the great multitude who
thronged the streets. The prisoner himself walked
behind, bareheaded, crowned with flowers, carrying one
end of the litter which supported the shrine of St.
Romain : the fetters he had worn hung from the litter ;
and with him paced, with lighted torches in their hands,
the men or women who, for the last seven years, had in
like manner received their pardon. Another beadle, in
a violet livery, marched behind bearing aloft on a pole



1 90 PRIVILEGE OF ST. ROMAIN LECT.
the wicker effigy of the dragon destroyed by St. Romain.
The clergy of the thirty-two parishes of Rouen also took part in the procession, which moved from the Old
Tower to the cathedral amid the acclamations of the
crowd, while from every church tower in the city the
bells rang out a joyous peal, the great bell Georges tT Amboise thundering above them all. After mass had
been performed in the cathedral, the prisoner was taken
to the house of the Master of the Brotherhood of St.
Romain, where he was magnificently feasted, lodged, and served, however humble his rank. Next morning
he again presented himself to the chapter, where, kneel
ing in the presence of a great assembly, he was severely reproved for his sins, and admonished to give thanks to
God, to St. Romain, and to the canons for the pardon
he had received in virtue of the privilege.
1
What was the origin and meaning of this remark
able privilege of theforfe, as the shrine of St. Romain
was called ? Its history has been carefully investigated
1 F. N. Taillepied, Recueil des Antiquitez et Singu/arite-z, de la villede Rouen (Rouen, 1587), pp. 93-105 ; A. Floquet, Histoire du privilege de Sxint Romain (2 vols. 8vo, Rouen, 1833). For briefer notices of the custom and legend, see A. Bosquet, La Normandie Romanesque et Merveillcuse (Paris and Rouen, 1845), pp. 405-409 5 A. de Nore, Coutumes, Mythes et Traditions des Provinces de France (Paris and Lyons, 1846), pp. 245-250. The %\\\.fierte or portable shrine of St. Romain is preserved in the Chapter Library of the Cathedral at Rouen, where I saw it in May 1902. It is in the form of a chapel, on the roof of which the saint stands erect, trampling on the winged dragon, while the condemned prisoner kneels in front of him. This, however, is not the original shrine, which was so decayed that in 1776 the chapter decided to replace it by another. See Floquet, op. cit. ii. 338-346. The custom of carrying the dragons in procession was stopped in 1753 because of its tendency to impair the solemnity of the ceremony (Floquet, ii. 301). Even more famous than the dragon of Rouen was the dragon of Tarascon, an effigy of which used to be carried in procession on Whitsunday. See A. de Nore, op. cit. pp. 47 sqq. Neither of these monsters is mentioned by Mr. P. Sebillot in his account of French dragons
(Le folk-lore de France, i. (Paris, 1904), pp. 468-470).



vi PRIVILEGE OF ST. ROMAIN 191
by Mons. A. Floquet, Chief Registrar of the Royal Court of Rouen, with the aid of all the documentary
evidence, including the archives both at Rouen and
Paris. He supposes the ceremony to have been in its
origin a scenic representation of the triumph of Christ over sin and death, the deliverance of the condemned
prisoner symbolising the deliverance of man from the
yoke of corruption, and bringing home to the people in a visible form the great mystery which the festival
of the Ascension was instituted to commemorate.
Such dramatic expositions of Christian doctrine, he
points out, were common in the Middle Ages.
Plausible as is this solution of the problem, it can
scarcely be regarded as satisfactory. Had this been
the real origin of the privilege we should expect to
find the Ascension of Christ either plainly enacted, or
at least distinctly alluded to in the ceremony ; but
apart from the singing of the hymn De resurrections
Domini this seems not to have been the case. More
over, the part played by the dragon in the legend and
in the spectacle seems too important to allow us to
explain it away, with M. Floquet, as a mere symbol of
the suppression of paganism by St. Romain. The tale
of the conquest of the dragon is older than Christianity
and cannot be explained by it. Judging from the
analogy of similar tales elsewhere, we may conjecture
that in the Rouen version the condemned criminal
represents a victim annually sacrificed to a water
spirit or other fabulous being, while the Christian
saint has displaced a pagan hero, who was said to



192 PRIVILEGE OF ST. ROMAIN LECT.
have delivered the victim from death and put an end
to the sacrifice by slaying the monster. Thus it seems
possible that the custom of annually pardoning a condemned malefactor may have superseded an older
practice of treating him as a public scapegoat, who died to save the rest of the people. Such customs
have been observed in many lands. It is not incredible
that at Rouen a usage of this sort should have survived
in a modified shape from pagan times down to the
twelfth century, and that the Church should at last
have intervened to save the wretch and turn a relic of
heathendom to the glory of God and St. Romain.
One more point and I have done. The sacrifice of
women to water-spirits appears to have been commonly intended to provide these mythical beings with wives.
Wherever that has been so, the water-spirit is obviously
supposed to be male. But men have also been sacri
ficed to water-spirits ;
l and where that has been the
practice, we may conjecture, though it certainly does not come out clearly, that the spirits are conceived as
female and the human victims as their husbands.
Whether the dragon of Rouen was considered as male
or female, we cannot say, since the condemned
prisoners, who on my hypothesis represented the victims formerly offered to him or her, might be either
men or women.
So much for the sacred marriage in general. In the

vi THE LATIN KINGS 193
next lecture I shall apply the results of our inquiry to
the legendary history of the Latin kings, especially the kings of Rome, to a consideration of whose
office the remainder of the lectures will be mainly
devoted.

The Sacred Marriage Numa and Egeria Kings of Rome and Alba personified Jupiter, the god of the oak and the thunder
Sacred marriage of Jupiter and Juno perhaps enacted by the King and Queen of Rome Roman kings regarded as sons of the fire god by his wives the Vestal Virgins Sacred fires and Vestal Virgins in Ireland and Peru.
IN the last lecture I adduced some examples of what
may be called the sacred marriage or the marriage
of the gods. The custom consists in solemnly marry
ing the gods to each other or to human beings who
act as consorts of the deities. Amongst the divine
powers whose wedding is thus publicly celebrated,
the deities of vegetation and of water hold a con
spicuous place. Such rites appear to aim at ensuring
the fertility of the earth, upon which the life of
animals and of men ultimately depends. Our survey
of them may perhaps be allowed to strengthen my
conjecture that a sacred marriage like that of our
King and Queen of May was annually solemnised at
Nemi, the wedded pair being the mortal King and the
immortal Queen of the Wood, Diana. In this con
nection it is to be remembered that the worship of
the sacred grove at Nemi centred round the powers
194



LECT. vii NUMA AND EGERIA 195
of water as well as of vegetation. The sanctuary of
the goddess stood on the shore of a secluded lake
which was known as Diana's mirror ; and further, one
of the mythical personages of the grove was Egeria, the nymph of a sacred spring. Here I would remind
you that, as I mentioned in my first lecture, the
nymph Egeria was said to be the wife of the old
Roman king Numa. Have we not in this legend
the reminiscence of a custom of marrying the King
of Rome to a goddess, like the custom of marrying
the Queen of Athens to a god ? Observe that Numa
was the very type of a priestly king ; most of the religious institutions of Rome were referred to him
as their founder. Such a king is precisely the sort
of personage most likely to contract a sacred union
with a goddess, whether the goddess is represented in the rite by an image or by a woman, who would
most naturally be the king's own wife, the queen. You will remember that the Queen of Egypt as well
as the Queen of Athens played the part of the divine
consort in the sacred marriage. Further, it should
be borne in mind that according to one tradition the
union of Numa with Egeria actually took place in the
hallowed wood at Nemi. This tradition may well
contain an echo of a similar marriage between the King
of the Wood and Diana in the same holy grove. At
least the coincidence is curious enough to justify us
in scrutinising more closely both Numa and Egeria, in order to see whether we cannot detect an affinity, on
the one hand, between Egeria and Diana, and, on



196 EGERIA LECT.
the other hand, between Numa and the King of the
Wood. Let us begin with Egeria.
We saw in the first lecture that Egeria, like Diana,
was regarded as a divinity who aided women in child
birth ; and further, she was, like Diana, associated with
water, being the nymph of a spring, while Diana was
the goddess of the lake. Moreover, like Diana, she
was also a tree-spirit ; for Plutarch tells us definitely
that she was a dryad or nymph of an oak ;
1 and this
statement is strongly confirmed by the etymology of
her name, if Mr. A. B. Cook is right in deriving it
from the same root aeg which appears in the Latin
aesculus, the Greek alyt,\oy<fr, and the German Eiche>
all meaning "an oak." 2 So many coincidences between
Egeria and Diana can hardly be accidental. We may
assume with a fair degree of probability that Egeria
and Diana, though they differ in name, are identical in
substance. Accordingly, we may restate the Roman
legend in other words by saying that the King of
Rome was married to the oak-goddess Diana either in
the sacred grove at Nemi or, according to others, in a
grove outside the walls of Rome.
But we have still to ask whether in this sacred
marriage the Roman king personated a god ? and if so r which god ? That he should have posed as a deity
will not seem improbable when we remember how
many monarchs have claimed to be divine. The old
Greek kings appear to have set up for being not merely

vii THE KING AS JUPITER 197
descendants of Zeus but actual embodiments on earth
of the great god ; for the learned Tzetzes, a mine of
antiquarian lore, tells us repeatedly that of old every king bore the title of Zeus ;
l and the legend of Salmoneus,
King of Elis, who posed as Zeus and in that character
made mock thunder and lightning, 2 probably reflects the
regular practice of early Greek kings. But if Greek kings claimed to be Zeus, we should expect to find the
Latin kings claiming to be Jupiter, the Italian counter
part of Zeus. That they actually did so is indicated
by a variety of evidence, to which I would now invite
your attention.
In the first place, then, they seem to have dressed
themselves as Jupiter and to have assumed his attributes.
For down to imperial times victorious generals cele
brating a triumph, and magistrates presiding at the games in the Circus, wore the costume of Jupiter, which
was borrowed for the occasion from his great temple on
the Capitol ; and it has been held with a high degree of
probability both by ancients and moderns that in doing
so they merely copied the traditionary attire and insignia of the Roman kings.

Hist, xxxiii. 127, 130, 137) with the golden crown which was held over him by a slave. The two crowns are
clearly distinguished by Zonaras (I.e.}, though he does not describe the shape of the golden crown. Mommsen himself mentions "a chaplet of oaken leaves in gold"
as part of the insignia of the Roman kings (Roman History, London, 1894, i. 83). 2 Pliny, Nat. Hist, xxxiii. 1 1 1 sq. j Servius, on Virgil, Eel. vi. 22, x. 27.



vii THE OAKEN CROWN 199
body of the wine-god Dionysus. 1 These customs may have been a substitute for an older practice of feeding
the god by smearing the face, and especially the lips, of his idol with the blood of a sacrificial victim. As the
triumphal procession always ended in the temple of
Jupiter on the Capitol, it was peculiarly appropriate that the head of the victor should be graced by a crown
of oak leaves ; for not only was every oak consecrated
to Jupiter,2 but the Capitoline temple of the god was said to have been built by Romulus beside a holy oak,
venerated by shepherds, to which the king attached the
spoils won by him from the enemy's general in battle.8
We are expressly told that the oak crown was sacred to
Capitoline Jupiter ;
4 a passage of Ovid proves that it
was regarded as the god's special emblem. Writing in exile on the shores of the Black Sea, the poet sends
the book which he has just composed to Rome to be
published there : he personifies the volume and imagines it passing along the Sacred Way and up to the door of
the emperor's palace on the Palatine hill. Above the
portal hung shining arms and a crown of oak leaves.
At the sight the poet starts : " Is this, quoth I, the
house of Jove? For sure to my prophetic soul the
oaken crown was reason good to think it so." 5 The
senate had granted Augustus the right to have the
wreath of oak always suspended over his door ;

200 THE OAKEN CROWN LECT.
another passage Ovid counts this among the more than
mortal honours bestowed on the emperor. 1 On the
Capitol at Cirta there stood a silver image of Jupiter
wearing a silver crown of oak leaves and acorns. 2
Similarly at Dodona, the most famous sanctuary of the
oak in Greece, the image of Zeus appears to have worn
a chaplet of oak leaves ; for the god is constantly thus
portrayed on coins of Epirus.8 Thus we may fairly assume that on certain solemn
occasions Roman generals and magistrates personated the supreme god, and that in doing so they revived the
practice of the early kings. To us moderns, for whom
the breech which divides the human from the divine
has deepened into an impassable gulf, such mimicry may appear impious. But it was otherwise with the ancients.
To their thinking gods and men were akin, for many
families traced their descent from a divinity, and the
deification of a man probably seemed as little extra
ordinary to them as the canonisation of a saint appears
to a modern Catholic. The Romans in particular were
quite familiar with the spectacle of mortals masquerad
ing as spirits ; for at the funerals of great houses all the
illustrious dead of the family were personated by men
specially chosen for their resemblance to the departed.
1 Ovid, Fasti, i. 607 sqq., iv. 953 sq. Tiberius refused a similar honour (Sueto
nius, Tiberius, 26) ; but Domitian seems to have accepted it (Martial, viii. 82. 7). Two statues of Claudius, one in the Vatican, the other in the Lateran museum, repreent the emperor as Jupiter wearing the oak crown (W. Helbig, Filhrer durch die offentlichen Sammlungcn klassischer Altertiimtr in Rom,z i. Nos. 312, 673). 2 C.I.L. viii. No. 6981. * J. Overbeck, Griechische Kunstmythologie, Besonderer Theil, i. 232 sqq. ; L. R. Farnell, The Cults of the Greek States, i. 107 sq.



vii THE ALEAN KINGS 201
These representatives wore masks fashioned and painted
in the likeness of the originals : they were dressed in
rich robes of office, resplendent with purple and gold,
such as the dead nobles had worn in their lifetime : like
them they rode in chariots through the city preceded by the rods and axes, and attended by all the pomp and
heraldry of high station ; and when at last the funeral
procession, after threading its way through the crowded streets, defiled into the Forum, the maskers solemnly
took their seats on ivory chairs, placed for them on the
platform of the Rostra, in the sight of the people,
recalling no doubt to the old, by their silent presence,
the memories of an illustrious past, and firing the young
with the ambition of a glorious future. 1
According to a tradition which we have no right to
reject, Rome was founded by settlers from Alba Longa,
a city which stood on the slope of the Alban hills,
overlooking Rome and the Campagna. 2 Hence if the
Roman kings claimed to be representatives or embodi
ments of Jupiter, the god of the sky, the thunder, and
the oak, it is natural to suppose that the kings of Alba,
from whom the founder of Rome traced his descent,
may have set up the same claim before them. Now the
Alban dynasty bore the name of Silvii, that is Wood
men, and it can hardly be without significance that in
the vision of the historic glories of Rome revealed
to ^Eneas in the underworld, Virgil, who was an
antiquary as well as a poet, represents all the line

202 SILVIUS AND JULUS LECT.
of the Silvii or Woods as crowned with oak. 1 A
chaplet of oak leaves would thus seem to have been
part of the insignia of the old kings of Alba Longa, as of their successors the kings of Rome ; in both cases it
marked the monarch as the human representative of the
oak god. With regard to Silvius, the first king of the
Alban dynasty, we are told that he got his name because
he had been born or brought up in the forest, and that
when he came to man's estate he contested the kingdom
with his kinsman Julus, whose name, as some of the
ancients themselves perceived, means the Little Jupiter.
The people decided in favour of Silvius, but his rival
Julus was consoled for the loss of the crown by being
invested with religious authority and the office of chief
pontiff, or perhaps rather of Flamen Dialis, the highest
dignity after the kingship. From this Julus or Little
Jupiter the noble house of the Julii, and hence the first
emperors of Rome, believed themselves to be sprung. 2
The legend of the dispute between Silvius and Julus

the derivation of the name Julus, see Aurelius Victor, op. cit. 15; Steuding, in
W. H. Roscher's Lexicon d. griech. u. rSm. Mythologie, ii. 574. Compare W. H. Lindsay, The Latin Language (Oxford, 1894), p. 250. According to Diodorus, the priesthood bestowed on Julus was the pontificate ; but the name Julus or Little Jupiter suggests that the office was rather that of Flamen Dialis, who was a sort of living embodiment of Jupiter (see below, p. 215), and whose name of Dialis is derived from the same root as Julus. On the Julii and their relation to Vejovis, see R. H. Klausen, Aeneas und die Penaten, ii. 1059 sqq. I have to thank Mr. A. B. Cook for directing my attention to the Alban kings and their interesting legends. See his article, "Zeus, Jupiter, and the Oak," Classical Review, xviii. (1904), pp. 363 *9



vii THE JULII 203
may preserve a reminiscence of such a partition of
spiritual and temporal powers in Alba Longa as afterwards took place in Rome, when the old regal office
was divided between the Consuls and the King of the
Sacred Rites. That the Julian house worshipped Vejovis
or the Little Jupiter, according to the ancient rites of
Alba Longa, is proved by the inscription on an altar which they dedicated to him at Bovillae, a colony of
Alba Longa, situated at the foot of the Alban hills. 1
The Caesars, the most illustrious family of the Julian
house, took their name from their long hair (caesaries)*
which was probably in those early days a symbol of
royalty, just as it was among the Franks many ages afterwards.
But in ceding the high-priesthood to their rivals,
it would seem that the reigning dynasty of the Silvii
or Woods by no means renounced their own claim
to personate the god of the oak and the thunder ; for
the Roman annals record that one of them, Romulus,
Remulus, or Amulius Silvius by name, pretended to be
a god in his own person, the equal or superior of
Jupiter. To support his pretensions and overawe his subjects, he constructed machines whereby he mimicked

204 THUNDERING KINGS LECT.
the roll of thunder and the flash of lightning. Diodorus
relates that in the season of fruitage, when thunder is
loud and frequent, the king commanded his soldiers to
drown the roar of heaven's artillery by clashing their
swords against their shields. But he paid the penalty
of his impiety ; for he perished, he and his house, struck
by a thunderbolt in the midst of a dreadful storm.
Swollen by the rain, the Alban lake rose in flood and
drowned his palace. But still, says an ancient historian,
when the water is low and the surface unruffled by a
breeze, you may see the ruins of the palace at the
bottom of the clear lake. 1 Taken along with the
similar story of Salmoneus, king of Elis, this legend
points to a real custom observed by the early kings of
Greece and Italy, who, like their fellows in Africa down
to modern times, may have been expected to produce
rain and thunder for the good of the crops. The
priestly king Numa passed for an adept in the art of
drawing down lightning from the sky.2 In this connection it deserves to be noted that,
according to the legend, Salmoneus, like his Alban
counterpart, was killed by a thunderbolt ; and that one
of the Roman kings, Tullus Hostilius, is reported to

have met with the same end in an attempt to draw
down Jupiter in the form of lightning from the
clouds. 1 jEneas himself, the legendary ancestor both
of the Alban and the Roman kings, vanished from the
world in a violent thunderstorm, and was afterwards
worshipped as Jupiter Indiges. A mound of earth, encircled with fine trees, on the bank of the little river
Numicius, was pointed out as his grave. 2 Romulus,
too, the first king of Rome, disappeared in like manner.
It was the seventh of July, and the king was reviewing
his army at the Goat's Marsh, outside the walls of the
city. Suddenly the sky lowered and a tempest burst, accompanied by peals of thunder. Soon the storm had
swept by, leaving the brightness and serenity of the summer day behind. But Romulus was never seen
again. Those who had stood by him said they saw him
caught up to heaven in a whirlwind ; and not long
afterwards a certain Proculus Julius, a patrician of
Alban birth and descent, declared on oath that Romulus
had appeared to him clad in bright armour, and had
announced that the Romans were to worship him as a
god under the name of Quirinus, and to build him a
temple on the spot. The temple was built, and the
place was thenceforth known as the Quirinal hill.8 If,

206 THUNDERING KINGS LECT.
as Mr. A. B. Cook has conjectured l and as seems to
be philologically possible, the word Quirinus contains the same root as quercus,
c< an oak," the name of the
deified Romulus would mean no more than " the oak
god," that is, Jupiter. Thus the tradition would
square perfectly with the other indications which have
led us to conclude that the kings both of Alba and
Rome claimed to be embodiments of Jupiter, the god
of the sky, of thunder, and of the oak. Certainly the
stories which associated the deaths of so many of them
with thunderstorms point to a close connection with the
deity of thunder and lightning. A king who had been
wont to fulminate in his lifetime might naturally be
supposed at death to be carried up in a thunderstorm
to heaven, there to discharge above the clouds the same
duties which he had performed on earth. Such a tale
would be all the more likely to attach itself to the twin
Romulus, if the early Romans shared the widespread
superstition that twins have power over* the weather in
general and over thunder and lightning in particular. That tempests are caused by the spirits of the dead is a
belief of the Araucanians of Chili. Not a storm bursts
upon the Andes or the ocean which these Indians do
not ascribe to a battle between the souls of their fellow
countrymen and those of the Spaniards. In the roar of
the wind they hear the trampling of the ghostly horses,
in the peal of the thunder the roll of the drums, and in
the flashes of lightning the fire of the artillery.

vii KINGS AS RAIN-MAKERS 207
Thus if the kings of Alba and Rome imitated
Jupiter as god of the oak by wearing a crown of oak
leaves, they seem also to have copied him in his
character of a weather god by pretending to make
thunder and lightning. And if they did so, it is
probable that, like Jupiter in heaven and many kings
on earth, they also acted as public rain-makers, wringing
showers from the darkling sky by their enchantments
whenever the parched earth cried out for the refreshing
moisture. At Rome the sluices of heaven were opened
by means of a sacred stone, and the ceremony appears
to have formed part of the ritual of Jupiter Elicius, the
god who elicits from the clouds the flashing lightning
and the dripping rain. 1 And who so fitted to perform
the ceremony as the king, the living representative of
the sky god ? The conclusion we have reached as to the kings of
Rome and Alba probably holds good of all the kings
of ancient Latium : each of them, we may suppose,
represented or embodied the local Jupiter. For we

208 JUPITER AND THE OAK LECT.
can hardly doubt that of old every Latin town or
settlement had its own Jupiter, as every town and almost
every church in modern Italy has its own Madonna ;
and like the Baal of the Semites the local Jupiter was
commonly worshipped on high places. Wooded heights, round which the rain -clouds gather, were
indeed the natural sanctuaries for a god of the sky,
the rain, and the oak. At Rome he occupied one
summit of the Capitoline hill, while the other summit
was assigned to his wife Juno, whose temple, with the
long flight of stairs leading up to it, has for ages been
appropriately replaced by the church of St. Mary " in
the altar of the sky "
(in Araceli)} That both heights were originally wooded seems certain, for down to
imperial times the saddle which joins them was known
as the place " between the two groves." 2
Virgil tells
us that the hill top, where gilded temples glittered in
his day, had been covered of old by shaggy thickets,
the haunt of woodland elves and savage men, " born of
the tree trunks and the heart of oak. " 8 These thickets
were probably composed of oaks, for the oak crown was
sacred to Capitoline Juno as well as to Jupiter :
4 it was
to a sacred oak on the Capitol, as I have said, that
Romulus fastened the spoils ; and there is evidence that
in early times oak woods clothed other of the hills on

vii THE FIRE OF OAK 209
which Rome was afterwards built. I will spare you the
details of the evidence, but there is one of them to
which I must call your attention. An old grove of
Vesta once skirted the foot of the Palatine hill on
the side of the Forum,1 and it must surely have been
a grove of oaks. For, in the first place, a fine ancient
relief representing the temple of Vesta shows an oak
tree growing beside it ; and in the second place, most
important of all, charred embers of the sacred vestal
fire were discovered by Signer Boni a few years ago at
the temple of Vesta, and a microscopic analysis of them has proved that they consist of the pith or heart of
trunks or great branches of oak (quercus, not ilex).*
This very remarkable fact, which I learned from its
illustrious discoverer during a winter spent in Rome, is
of high importance for the understanding of the early religion, not only of the Romans, but of all the Latin
peoples ; for every Latin town would seem to have had
its vestal fire, and the discovery of the charred embers
in the Forum raises a presumption that every vestal
fire in Latium was fed with the wood of the sacred oak,
the tree of the supreme god Jupiter. Indeed there is
reason to think that all the branches of the Aryan
family in Europe fed their sacred fires with oak wood ;
1 Cicero, Dt divination*, i. 45. 101. 'J G. Boni, in Not'mie dtgli Scavi, May 1900, pp. 161, 172; /</., Atdei fetter, p. 14 (extract from the Nuova Antologia, itt August 1900). Commendatore Boni thinks that the charred remain* of the wood prove that the fire was extinguished, probably by libations, and that therefore it cannot have been the perpetual holy fire of Vesta, which would have consumed the fuel completely. But a new fire was annually lit on the first of March (Ovid, f*m, iii. 143 ?. j Macrobius, Saturn. i. 12. 6), which may imply that the old fire was first ceremonially extinguished, as often happens in such cases.

210 L ATI'AN JUPITER LECT.
the old Lithuanians, for example, are known to have
done this in honour of their chief god Perkunas, the
deity of thunder and lightning, who corresponded to
Zeus and Jupiter. 1 According to some philologers the
very name Perkunas means " the oak god," being
derived from the root perq, which reappears in the
Latin quercus, " an oak." 2
If the kings of Rome aped Capitoline Jupiter, their
predecessors the kings of Alba probably laid themselves out to mimic the great Latian Jupiter, who had his
seat above the city on the summit of the Alban
Mountain. Latinus, the legendary ancestor of the
dynasty, was said to have been changed into Latian
Jupiter after vanishing from the world in the mysterious fashion characteristic of the old Latin kings. 3 The
sanctuary of the god on the top of the mountain was
the religious centre of the Latin League, as Alba was
its political capital till Rome wrested the supremacy
from its ancient rival. Apparently no temple, in our
sense of the word, was ever erected to Jupiter on this
his holy mountain : as god of the sky and the thunder
he appropriately received the homage of his worshippers
in the open air. 4 His oldest sanctuary on this airy

spot was a grove ;
l and bearing in mind not merely
the special consecration of the oak to Jupiter, but also
the traditional oak crown of the Alban kings and the
analogy of the oak of Capitoline Jupiter at Rome, we may suppose that the trees in the grove were oaks.
We know that in antiquity Mount Algidus, an out
lying group of the Alban hills, was covered with dark
forests of oak both of the evergreen and the ordinary
sort ;
8 and among the tribes who belonged to the
Latin League in the earliest days, and were entitled to
share the flesh of the sacrificial white bull, there was
one whose members styled themselves Men of the Oak,4
doubtless on account of the woods among which they
dwelt.
But we should err if we pictured to ourselves the
country as covered in historical times with an unbroken
forest of oaks. Theophrastus has left us a description
of the woods of Latium as they were in the fourth
century before Christ. He says : " The land of the
Latins is all moist. The plains produce laurels, myrtles,
Passionist monastery, founded in 1777, by Cardinal York, the last of the Stuarts, has now been converted into a meteorological station and an inn (K. Baedeker, Central
Italy and Rome p. 400). It is fitting that the atmospheric phenomena should be observed by modern science on the same spot where they were worshipped by ancient
piety. 1 Livy. i. 31. 3. 1 According to tradition, the sow which marked the future site of Alba Longa was found lying under evergreen oaks (Virgil, Aen. viii. 43), as Mr. A. B. Cook has pointed out (Qauical Review, xviii. 363). The tradition seems to show that the neighbourhood of the city was wooded with oaks.

and wonderful beeches ; for they fell trees of such a size
that a single stem suffices for the keel of a Tyrrhenian
ship. Pines and firs grow on the mountains. What
they call the land of Circe is a lofty headland thickly
wooded with oak, myrtle, and luxuriant laurels." l
Thus the prospect from the top of the Alban
Mount in the early age of Rome must have been very
different in some respects from what it is to-day. The
purple Apennines, indeed, in their eternal calm on the
one hand, and the shining Mediterranean in its eternal
unrest on the other, no doubt looked then much as they
look now, whether bathed in sunshine or chequered by
the fleeting shadows of clouds. But instead of the
desolate brown expanse of the fever-stricken Campagna,
spanned by its long lines of ruined aqueducts, like the
broken arches of the bridge in the vision of Mirza, the
eye must have ranged over woodlands that stretched
away, mile after mile, on all sides, till their varied
hues of green or autumnal scarlet and gold melted
insensibly into the blue of the distant mountains and
sea.
The Alban Mount was thus to the Latins what
Olympus was to the Greeks, the lofty abode of the sky
god, who hurled his thunderbolts from above the
clouds. The white steers which were here sacrificed
to him in his sacred grove, as on the Capitol at Rome, 2
remind us of the white bulls which the Druids of Gaul
sacrificed under the holy oak before they cut the

mistletoe ;
l and the parallel would be all the closer if,
as we have reason to think, the Latins worshipped
Jupiter originally in groves of oak. When we remember that the ancient Italian and Celtic people spoke
languages which were nearly akin,2 we shall not be
surprised at discovering traces of community in their
religion, especially in what concerns the worship of the god of the oak and the thunder. For that worship
belongs to the oldest stratum of the Aryan civilisation
in Europe. But Jupiter did not reign alone on the top of the
Alban Mount. He had his consort with him, the
goddess Juno, who was worshipped here under the
same title, Moneta, as on the Capitol at Rome. 8 As
the oak crown was sacred to Jupiter and Juno on the
Capitol, so we may suppose it was on the Alban Mount,
from which the Capitoline worship was derived. Thus
the oak god would have his oak goddess in the sacred oak
grove. So at Dodona the oak Zeus was coupled with
Dione, whose very name is only a dialectically different form of Juno ;
4 and so on the top of Mount Cithaeron,
as we saw in the last lecture, the god was periodically
wedded to an oaken image of Hera. It is probable,

2i 4 THE SACRED MARRIAGE LECT.
though it cannot be positively proved, that the sacred
marriage of Jupiter and Juno was annually celebrated by all the peoples of the Latin stock in the month
which they named after the goddess, the midsummer
month of June. 1 Now on the first of June the Roman
pontiffs performed certain rites in the grove of Helernus
beside the Tiber, and on the same day, and perhaps in
the same place, a nymph of the grove, by name Carna,
received offerings of lard and bean porridge. She was
said to be a coy huntress who gave the slip to her
suitors in the depth of the wood, but was caught by
Janus. Some took her to be Diana herself. 2 If she
was indeed a form of that goddess, her union with
Janus, that is, Dianus, would be appropriate ; and as
she had a chapel on the Caslian hill, which is known to
have been once covered with oak woods, 3 she may, like
Egeria, have been an oak nymph. Further, Janus or
Dianus, and Diana, as we shall see later on, were
originally mere doubles of Jupiter and Juno, with whom they coincide in name and to some extent in

Junius, "Junonius, and Junonalh. See Ovid, Fasti, vi. 59-63 j Macrobius, Sat. i. 12. 30 ; Festus, p. 103, ed. C. O. Miiller. The two latter forms seem to render the derivation of Junius from Juno quite certain.

(Festus, lice. ; Varro, De lingua Latir.a, v. 49). These nymphs are represented on coins (E. Babelon, Monnaics de la Refrublique Romaine, i. 99 sq.).

function. Hence it appears to be not impossible that
the rite celebrated by the pontiffs on the first of June
in the sacred grove of Helernus was the marriage of
Jupiter and Juno under the forms of Janus and Diana.
It would be some confirmation of this view if we could
be sure that, as Ovid seems to imply, the Romans were
in the habit of placing branches of white thorn or buck
thorn in their windows on the first of June to keep out
the witches ;
l for in some parts of Europe precisely the same custom is observed, for the same reason, a month
earlier, on the marriage day of the King and Queen of
May. 2 However, the evidence as to the rites observed
by the Romans on the first of June is too slight and
dubious to allow us to press the parallel with May
Day. If at any time of the year the Romans celebrated the
sacred marriage of Jupiter and Juno, as the Greeks
commonly celebrated the corresponding marriage of Zeus and Hera, we may suppose that under the
Republic the ceremony was either performed over images of the divine pair or acted by the Flamen Dialis
and his wife the Flaminica. For the Flamen Dialis
was the priest of Jove ; indeed ancient and modern
writers have regarded him, with much probability, as a
living image of Jupiter, a human embodiment of the
sky god. 8 In earlier times the Roman king, as repre

sentative of Jupiter, would naturally play the part of
the heavenly bridegroom at the sacred marriage, while
his queen would figure as the heavenly bride, just as in
Egypt the king and queen masqueraded in the character of deities, and as at Athens the queen annually wedded
the vine god Dionysus. Even if the office of Flamen
Dialis existed under the kings, as it appears to have
done, the double representation of Jupiter by the king and the flamen need not have seemed extraordinary to
the Romans of the time. The same sort of duplication,
as we saw, appears to have taken place at Alba, when
the Julii were allowed to represent the supreme god in
the character of Little Jupiters, while the royal dynasty
of the Silvii continued to wield the divine thunder and
lightning. And long ages afterwards, history repeating
itself, another member of the Julian house, the first
Emperor of Rome, was deified in his lifetime under the
title of Jupiter, while a flamen was appointed to do for
him what the Flamen Dialis did for the heavenly Jove. 1
It is said that Numa, the typical priestly king, at first himself discharged the functions of Flamen Dialis, but
afterwards appointed a separate priest of Jupiter with that title, in order that the kings, untrammelled by the
burdensome religious observances attached to the priest
hood, might be free to lead their armies to battle. 2 The
tradition may be substantially correct ; for analogy
shows that the functions of a priestly king are too

vii AS JUPFFER AND JUNO 217
harassing and too incongruous to be permanently united in the same hands, and that sooner or later the
holder of the office seeks to rid himself of part of his
burden by deputing to others, according to his temper and tastes, either his civil or his religious duties. Hence
we may take it as probable that the fighting kings of
Rome, tired of parading as Jupiter and of observing all the tedious restrictions which the character of godhead
entailed on them, were glad to relegate these pious mummeries to a substitute, in whose hands they left the
crosier at home while they went forth to wield the sharp
Roman sword abroad. This would explain why the
traditions of the later kings, from Tullus Hostilius
onwards, exhibit so few traces of sacred or priestly
functions adhering to their office. Among the cere
monies which they henceforward performed by deputy
may have been the rite of the sacred marriage.
Whether that was so or not, the legend of Numa
and Egeria appears to embody a reminiscence of a time
when the priestly king himself played the part of the
divine bridegroom ; and as we have seen reason to
suppose that the Roman kings personated the oak god, while Egeria is expressly said to have been an oak
nymph, the story of their union in the sacred grove
raises a presumption that at Rome in the regal period a
ceremony was periodically performed exactly analogous to that which was annually celebrated at Athens down
to the time of Aristotle. The marriage of the king of
Rome to the oak goddess, like the wedding of the vine
god to the Queen of Athens, must have been intended



2i 8 THE LATIN KINGS LECT.
to quicken the growth of vegetation by homoeopathic magic. Of the two forms of the sacred marriage we
can hardly doubt that the Roman was the older, and
that long before the northern invaders met with the
vine on the shores of the Mediterranean, their fore
fathers had married the oak god to the oak goddess in
the vast forests of central and northern Europe. In
the England of our day the forests have mostly dis
appeared, yet still on many a village green and in many a country lane a faded image of the sacred marriage
lingers in the rustic pageantry of May Day.
So much for the custom of marrying human beings
to deities, especially to deities of vegetation and water.
But there is another case of that custom which we must
now briefly consider, namely, the practice of marrying women to the god of the fire. This practice is of some
importance for the understanding of the early history of the Latins, since there are grounds for thinking that
the old Latin kings were commonly supposed to be sons of the fire god by a mortal mother. The evidence
which has led me to this conclusion is as follows.
First, let us take the legend of the birth of King
Servius Tullius. It is said that one day the virgin
Ocrisia, a slave-woman of Queen Tanaquil, was offering
as usual cakes and libations on the royal hearth when
a flame shot out towards her from the fire. Taking
this for a sign that her handmaiden was to be the
mother of a more that mortal son, the wise Queen
Tanaquil bade the girl array herself as a bride and lie



vii BORN OF THE FIRE 219
down beside the hearth. Her orders were obeyed :
Ocrisia conceived by the god or spirit of the fire, and
in due time brought forth Servius Tullius, the future
king of Rome, who was thus born a slave, being the
reputed son of a slave mother and a divine father, the
fire god. His birth from the fire was attested in his
childhood by a flame that played about his head as he
slept at noon in the king's palace.
1 This story, as
others have pointed out before,2 seems clearly to imply
that the mother of Servius Tullius was a Vestal Virgin
charged with the care and worship of the sacred fire in
the king's house. Now in Promathion's History of Italy,
cited by Plutarch, a similar tale was told of the birth
of Romulus himself, the founder of Rome. It is said
that in the house of the king of Alba a flame of a
mysterious shape hung over the hearth for many days. Learning from an oracle that a virgin should conceive
by this phantom and bear a son of great valour and
renown, the king ordered one of his daughters to take
the fiery apparition for her husband ; but she disdained
to do so and sent her handmaid instead. The hand
maid complied, and became the mother of Romulus
and Remus. The king, angry at his daughter's dis
obedience, would have put her and her slave-woman
to death, but the lives of the girls were saved by the
interposition of the goddess Vesta in a dream. 8 In

220 THE LATIN KINGS LECT.
this legend, as in the story of the birth of Servius
Tullius, it is plain that the mother of the future
king of Rome was both a slave and a Vestal Virgin.
Orthodox Roman tradition always admitted that she
was a Vestal, but naturally enough represented her as the king's daughter rather than his slave. 1 How
ever, when we compare this legend with the similar
story of the birth of Servius Tullius, we may suspect
that Plutarch's authority, Promathion, has preserved the
genuine tradition, and a very remarkable one it is ;
he has, in fact, betrayed the secret that in the old days
one of the king's parents might be, and sometimes was,
a slave. At all events, such tales bear witness to an
old belief that the early Roman kings were born of
virgins and of the fire. Similarly, Caeculus, the
founder of Praeneste, passed for a son of Vulcan. It
was said that his mother conceived him through a
spark, which leapt from the fire and struck her as she
sat by the hearth. She exposed the child near a temple
of Jupiter, and he was found there beside a fire by
some maidens who were going to draw water. In after
life he proved his divine birth by working an appro
priate miracle. When an infidel crowd refused to
believe that he was the son of a god, he prayed to his
father, and immediately the unbelievers were encircled
with a flame of fire. 2
More than this, the whole of the Alban dynasty
appear to have traced their descent from a Vestal ; for

vii BORN OF THE FIRE 221
the wife of King Latinus, their legendary ancestor, was
named Amata or Beloved, 1 and this was the regular
title bestowed on a Vestal after her election,2 a title
which cannot be fully understood except in the light of
the foregoing traditions, which seem to show that the
Vestals were supposed to be beloved by the fire god.
Moreover, fire is said to have played round the head of
Amata's daughter Lavinia, 3
just as it played round the
head of the fire-born Servius Tullius. As the same
prodigy was reported of Julus or Ascanius, the son of
/Eneas, 4 we may suspect that a similar legend was told
of his miraculous conception at the hearth. In short,
the old Latin kings appear to have been regularly
regarded as sons of the fire god by Vestal Virgins, who
were believed to be the god's wives. That belief
would explain why during their term of office the
Vestals had to remain strictly celibate : the bride must
be true to her divine bridegroom. And the difficulty
of reconciling the theory of celibacy with the practice of motherhood is easily overcome by the custom of
allowing a man to masquerade as a god at the sacred
marriage, just as in Egypt the king disguised himself as a god when he wedded the queen. Thus the
doctrine of the divine birth of kings, which was strictly
held in ancient Egypt, presents no serious difficulty to
1 Virgil, Atn. vii. 343. * Aulu Gellius, i. 12. 14 and 19. Compare L. Preller, ROmiscAe Mytkologie* ii. 161, 344. There was a very ancient worship of Vesta at Lavinium, the city named after Amata't daughter Lavinia, the ancestress of the Alban kings. See Servius, on Virgil, Am. ii. 296 ; Macrobius, Saturn, iii. 4. 1 1. * Virgil, Atn. vii. 71-77. * Ibid. ii. 680-686.



222 MOTHER VESTA LECT.
people who believe that a god may become incarnate
in the form of a man, and that a virgin may conceive
and bear him a son. I need hardly say that the theory
of the divine motherhood of the Vestals applies only to
the early regal and therefore prehistoric period. Under the Republic the demand for kings had ceased and with
it therefore the supply. Yet a trace of the old view
of the Vestals as virgin mothers lingered down to the
latest times in the character of Vesta herself, their
patroness and type ; for Vesta always bore the official
title of Mother, never that of virgin.
1 We may surmise
that a similar belief and practice once obtained in Attica.
For Erichthonius, king of Athens, is said to have been
a son of the fire god Hephaestus by the virgin goddess Athena : the story of his miraculous birth from the
earth is clearly a later version devised to save the
virginity of his mother. 2
The relation of the Latin kings to the Vestals and
their sacred fire is full of interest, and I might dwell on
it much longer ; but time presses and I must hurry
on. Before quitting the subject I will take notice of
some evidence that among the Celts, as among the
early Latins, perpetual sacred fires were maintained by
Vestal Virgins. We know from Solinus that in our
own country perpetual fires were kept up in the temple of a goddess whom the Romans identified with
1 Virgil, Georg. i. 498 ; Ovid, Fasti, iv. 828 ; G. Henzen, Acta fratrum AwaUum, pp. 124, 147 ; H. Dessau, Inscriptions Latinae Selectae, Nos. 5047, 5048. Ennius represented Vesta as the mother of Saturn and Titan. See Lactantius,

vii BR1G1TS FIRE 223
Minerva, 1 but whose native Celtic name appears to have
been Brigit. Like Minerva, Brigit was a goddess of
poetry and wisdom, and she had two sisters, also called
Brigit, who presided over leechcraft and smithcraft respect
ively. This appears to be only another way of saying
that Brigit was the patroness of bards, physicians, and smiths. 2 Now, at Kildare in Ireland the nuns of St.
Brigit, or St. Bridget as she is also called, tended a
perpetual holy fire down to the suppression of the monasteries under Henry VIII. ; and we can hardly
doubt that in doing so they merely kept up, under a
Christian name, an ancient pagan worship of Brigit in
her character of a fire goddess or patroness of smiths.
The nuns were nineteen in number. Each of them had
the care of the fire for a single night in turn ; and on
the twentieth evening the last nun, having heaped
wood on the fire, used to say, " Brigit, take charge of
your own fire ; for this night belongs to you." She
then went away, and next morning they always found
the fire still burning and the usual quantity of fuel
consumed. Like the vestal fire at Rome in the old
days, the fire of St. Brigit burned within a circular
enclosure made of stakes and brushwood, and no male
might set foot inside the fence. The nuns were
allowed to fan the fire or to blow it up with bellows,
but they might not blow on it with their breath. 8

Similarly it is said that the Balkan Slavs will not blow
with their mouths on the holy fire of the domestic
hearth :
1 a Brahman is forbidden to blow a fire with
his mouth ;
2 and among the Parsees the priests have to
wear a veil over their lips lest they should defile the
sacred fire with their breath. 8 At Arkon, in the island
of Riigen, there was a shrine so holy that none but the
priest might enter it, and even he might not breathe in
it. As often as he needed to draw breath or give it
out, he used to run out of the door lest he should taint
the divine presence by inhaling or exhaling the air. 4
In Ireland the custom of maintaining a perpetual fire
was not peculiar to Kildare, but seems to have been
common ; for the native records show that such fires
were kept up in several monasteries, in each of which a
small church or oratory was set apart for the purpose.
in the island of Sena (the modern Sein), off the coast of Brittany, there was an oracle of a Gallic deity whose worship was cared for by nine virgin priestesses. They could raise storms by their incantations and turn themselves into any
animals they pleased (Mela, iii. 48) ; but it is not said that they maintained
a perpetual holy fire, though Ch. Elton affirms that they did (Origins of English History, p. 27). Mr. S. Reinach dismisses these virgins as a fable based on Homer's description of the isle of Circe (Odyssey, x. 135 sqq.}, and he denies that the Gauls
employed virgin priestesses (Cuhes, Mythes, et Religions, \. (Paris, 1905), pp.
195-203). To me the nuns of St. Brigit seem to be most probably the successors
of a Celtic order of Vestals charged, like the Roman Vestals, with the maintenance of a holy fire. That there were female Druids is certain, but it does not appear
whether they were virgins. See Lampridius, Alexander Severus, 60 ; Vopiscus, Aurelianus, 44 ; id., Numerianus, 14 sq.

vii IN IRELAND 225
This was done, for example, at the monasteries of
Seirkieran, Kilmainham, and Inishmurray. 1 We may
conjecture that these holy fires were merely survivals
of the perpetual fires which in heathen times had
burned in honour of Brigit. The view that Brigit was
a fire goddess is confirmed by the observation that in
the Christian calendar her festival falls the day before
Candlemas, and the customs observed at that season by
Celtic peasantry seem to prove that she was a goddess
of the crops as well as of fire. 2 If that was so, it is
another reason for comparing her to Vesta, whose holy
virgins, as we know from Ovid, performed ceremonies
every year to fertilise both the earth and the cattle. 3
Lastly, there are grounds for connecting Brigit, like Vesta, with the oak ; for at Kildare her Christian
namesake, St. Brigit or St. Bridget, built her church
under an oak tree, which existed till the tenth century
and gave its name to the spot ; for Kildare is Cill-dara y
44 the church of the oak." 4 A tradition of the oak
lingers in the lines :

times the hallowed fire was fed, like the vestal fire at
Rome, with the wood of the sacred tree.
We may suspect that a conversion of this sort was
often effected in Ireland by the early Christian mission
aries. The monasteries of Derry and Durrow, founded
by St. Columba, were both named after the oak groves
in which they were built ; and at Derry the saint
spared the beautiful trees and strictly enjoined his
successors to do the same. In his old age, when he
lived as an exile on the shores of the bleak and storm
swept isle of lona, his heart yearned to the home of
his youth among the oak groves of Ireland, and he
gave expression to the yearning in passionate verses which have come down to us :
That spot is the dearest on Erin's ground,
For the treasures that peace and purity lend,
For the hosts of bright angels that circle it round,
Protecting its borders from end to end.
The dearest of any on Erin's ground,
For its peace and its beauty I gave it my love ;
Each leaf of the oaks around Derry is founa To be crowded with angels from heaven above.
My Derry ! my Derry ! my little oak grove, My dwelling, my home, and my own little cell, May God the Eternal in Heaven above
Send death to thy foes, and defend thee well.1
Far from the oaks of Erin and the saint's last home
among the stormy Hebrides, a sacred fire has been
tended by holy virgins, with statelier rites and in more
solemn fanes, under the equinoctial line. The Incas

vii BRIDES OF THE SUN 227
of Peru, who deemed themselves the children of the
Sun, procured a new fire from their great father at the
solstice in June, our Midsummer Day. They kindled it
by holding towards the Sun a hollow mirror, which
reflected his beams on a tinder of cotton wool. But if
the sky happened to be overcast at the time, they made
the new fire by the friction of two sticks ; and they
looked on it as a bad omen when they were obliged to
do this, for they said the Sun must be angry with them,
since he refused to kindle the flame with his own hand.
The sacred fire, however obtained, was deposited in
Cuzco, the capital of Peru, in the temple of the Sun,
and also in a great convent of holy virgins, who
guarded it carefully throughout the year, and it was an
evil augury if they suffered it to go out. These virgins
were regarded as the wives of the Sun, and they were
bound to perpetual celibacy. If any of them proved unfaithful to her husband the Sun, she was buried
alive, like a Roman Vestal, and her guilty paramour
was strangled. The reason for putting her to death in
this manner was probably, as at Rome, a reluctance to
shed royal blood ; for all these virgins were of the
royal family, being daughters of the Incas or his kinsmen. Besides tending the holy fire, they had to weave
and make all the clothes worn by the Inca and his wife,
to bake the bread that was offered to the Sun at his
great festivals, and to brew the wine which the Inca
and his family drank on these occasions. All the
furniture of the convent, down to the pots, pans, and
jars, was of gold and silver, just as in the temple of

the Sun, because the virgins were deemed to be his
wives. And they had a golden garden, where the very
clods were of fine gold ; where golden maize reared its
stalks, leaves, and cobs, all of the same precious metal ;
and where golden shepherds, with slings and crooks of
gold, tended golden sheep and lambs. 1 The analogy of these virgin guardians of the sacred flame furnishes an
argument in favour of the theory maintained in this
lecture ; for if the Peruvian Vestals were the brides of
the sun, may not the Roman Vestals have been the
brides of the fire ?

IN the last lecture I adduced some grounds for think
ing that the early Latin kings personated the great god Jupiter and mimicked him by attempting to make
rain, thunder, and lightning ; further, that they went
through a form of sacred marriage to ensure the fertility
of the earth ; and lastly, that they often passed for sons
of the fire god by Vestal Virgins, who were deemed the
fire god's wives.
But we have still to ask, What was the rule of
succession to the kingdom among the old Latin tribes ?
We possess two lists of Latin kings, both of them
professedly complete. One is the list of the kings of Alba, and the other is the list of the kings of Rome. If

we accept as authentic the list of the Alban kings, we
can only conclude that the kingdom was hereditary in
the male line, the son regularly succeeding his father on
the throne. 1 But this list, if it is not, as Niebuhr held,
a late and clumsy fabrication, has somewhat the appear
ance of an elastic cord which ancient historians stretched
in order to link tineas to Romulus. 2 Yet it would be
rash to set these names aside as a chronological stop
gap deliberately foisted in by later annalists. In early
monarchies, before the invention of writing, tradition is
remarkably retentive of the names of kings. The
Baganda of Central Africa, for example, remember the
names of more than thirty of their kings in an un
broken chain of twenty-two generations.
3 Even the
occurrence of foreign names among the Alban kings
is not of itself sufficient to condemn the list as a
forgery ; for, as I shall show presently, this feature is
explicable by a rule of descent which appears to have
prevailed in many early monarchies, including that of
Rome. Perhaps the most we can say for the history
of the Alban kings is that their names may well be

genuine, and that some general features of the
monarchy, together with a few events which happened to strike the popular imagination, may have survived
in the memory of the people until they found their
way into written history. But no dependence can be placed either on the alleged years of their
reigns, or on the hereditary principle which is assumed to have connected each king with his pre
decessor.
When we come to the list of the Roman kings we
are on much firmer, though still slippery ground.
According to tradition there were in all eight kings
of Rome, 1 and with regard to the five last of them, at
all events, we can hardly doubt that they did really sit
on the throne, and that the traditional history of their
reigns is, in its main outlines, correct. 2 Now it is very
remarkable that though the first king of Rome,
Romulus, is said to have been descended from the
royal house of Alba, in which the kingship is repre
sented as hereditary in the male line, not one of the
Roman kings was immediately succeeded by his son on
the throne. Yet several left sons or grandsons behind
them. 8 On the other hand, one of them was descended
from a former king through his mother, not through
1 Romulus and Tatiui reigned for a time together ; after Romulus the kings were, in order of succession, Numa Pompilius, Tullus Hostilius, Ancus Marcius, the elder Tarquin, Servius Tullius, and Tarquin the Proud. * See A. Schwegler, ROmitcke Gcuhicktt, i. 579 tq. * According to one account, Romulus had a son and daughter (Plutarch, Romu/nt, 14). Some held that Numa had four sons (Plutarch, AWd, 21). Ancus Marcius
left two sons (Livy, i. 35. i, i. 40 ; Dionysius Halicarn. Ant. Rom. iii. 72 jy., iv. 34. 3). Tarquin the Elder left two sons or grandsons (Livy, i. 46 } Dionysius Halicarn. Ant. Rom. iv. 6 *f ., iv. 28).

his father,1 and three of them, namely, Tatius, the
elder Tarquin, and Servius Tullius, were succeeded by
their sons-in-law,2 who were all either foreigners or of
foreign descent. 8 This suggests that the right to the
kingship was transmitted in the female line, and was
actually exercised by foreigners who married the royal
princesses. To put it in technical language, the succes
sion to the kingship of Rome, and probably in Latium
generally, would seem to have been determined by
certain rules which have moulded early society in many
parts of the world, namely, exogamy, beena marriage, and female kinship. Exogamy is the rule which
obliges a man to marry a woman of a different clan
from his own : beena marriage is the rule that he must

Tarquin the Proud married Tullia, the daughter of Servius Tullius (Livy, i. 42. i,
i. 46. 5). 8 Numa was a Sabine from Cures (Livy, i. 18 j Plutarch, Numa, 3 j Dionysius Halicarn. Ant. Rom. ii. 58). Servius Tullius, according to the common account, was the son of Ocrisia, a slave-woman of Corniculum (Livy, i. 39. 5 ; Dionysius Halicarn. Ant. Rom. iv. i) j but according to the Etruscan annals he was an Etruscan, by name Mastarna, who came to Rome with his friend Caeles Vibenna, and, changing his name, obtained the kingdom. This was stated by the Emperor Claudius in a speech of which fragments are engraved on a bronze tablet found at Lyons. See Tacitus, Annals, ed. Orelli and Baiter,2 p. 342. The Emperor was an authority on Etruscan history, for he composed a Greek work on the subject in twenty books (Suetonius, Claudius, 42). The historical, or at least legendary, character of Mastarna and Caeles is vouched for by a painting inscribed with their names, which was found in 1857 in an Etruscan tomb at Vulci
(G. Dennis, Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria* ii. 506 sq.}. Lastly, Tarquin the Proud was a son of the elder Tarquin, who was an Etruscan from Tarquinii (Livy,
i. 34 j Cicero, De re publica, ii. 19 sq., 34 sq.}. The foreign birth of their kings naturally struck the Romans themselves. See the speech put in the mouth of the elder Tarquin by Livy, i. 35. 3, and the speech actually delivered by the Emperor
Claudius (loc. cit.}.



vin HEREDITARY THROUGH WOMEN 233
leave the home of his birth and live with his wife's
people ;
l and female kinship is the system of tracing
relationship and transmitting the family name through women instead of through men. If these principles
regulated descent of the kingship among the ancient
Latins, the state of things in this respect would be
somewhat as follows. The political and religious
centre of each community would be the perpetual fire
on the king's hearth, tended by Vestal Virgins of the
royal clan. The king would be a man of another
clan, perhaps of another town or even of another race,
who had married a daughter of his predecessor and
received the kingdom with her. The children whom
he had by her would inherit their mother's name, not
his : the daughters would remain at home : the sons,
when they grew up, would go away into the world,
marry, and settle in their wives' country, whether as
kings or commoners. Of the daughters who stayed at
home, some or all would be dedicated as Vestal Virgins
for a longer or shorter time to the service of the fire on
the hearth, and one of them would in time become the
wife of her father's successor.
This hypothesis has the advantage of explaining in a simple and natural way some obscure features in the
traditional history of the Latin kings. Thus the
legends which tell how the kings were born of virgin
1 *' In Ceylon, where the higher and lower polyandry coexist, marriage it of two sorts Deega or Been a according as the wife goe$ to live in the home and Tillage of her husbands, or as the husband or husbands come to live with her in or near the house of her birth" (J. F. M'Lennan, Studitt in Ancient History (London, 1886),
p. oi).



234 FOREIGN KINGS LECT.
mothers and divine fathers become at least more
intelligible. For stripped of their fabulous element
such tales mean no more than that a child's father is
unknown ; and this uncertainty as to fatherhood is
more easily compatible with a system of kinship which
ignores paternity than with one which makes it all
important. If among the Latins the women of royal blood
always stayed at home and received as their consorts
men of another stock, and often of another country,
who reigned as kings in virtue of their marriage with a
native princess, we can understand not only why
foreigners wore the crown at Rome, but also why
foreign names occur in the list of the Alban kings.
In a state of society where nobility is reckoned only
through women, in other words, where descent through
the mother is everything and descent through the
father is nothing, no objection will be felt to uniting girls of the highest rank to men of humble birth, even
to aliens or slaves, provided that in themselves the men
appear to be suitable mates. What really matters is
that the royal stock, on which the prosperity and even
the existence of the people is supposed to depend,
should be perpetuated in a vigorous and efficient form,
and for this purpose it is necessary that the women of
the royal family should bear children to men who are
physically and mentally fit, according to the standard
of early society, to discharge the important duty of
fatherhood. Thus the personal qualities of kings at
this stage of social evolution are deemed of vital



vin KINGSHIP IN ASHANTEE 235
importance. If they, like their wives, are of royal and
divine descent, so much the better ; but it is not
essential that they should be so.
The hypothesis which we have been led to frame of
the rule of succession to the Latin kingship will be
confirmed by analogy if we can show that elsewhere,
under a system of female kinship, the paternity of the kings is a matter of indifference ; nay, that men who
are born slaves may, like Servius Tullius, marry royal
princesses and be raised to the throne. Now this is
true of the Tshi-speaking peoples of the Gold Coast in
West Africa. Thus in Ashantee, where the kingdom
descends in the female line to the king's brothers and
afterwards to the sons of his sisters in preference to his
own sons, the sisters of the reigning monarch are free
to marry whom they please, provided only that their husband be a strong and handsome man, in order that
the kings whom he begets may be men of finer presence
than their subjects. It matters not how humble
may be the rank and position of the king's father. If
the king's sisters, however, have no sons, the throne
will pass to the king's own son, and failing a son, to
the chief vassal or the chief slave. But in the Fantee
country the principal slave succeeds to the exclusion of
the son. So little regard is paid by these people to the
lineage, especially the paternal lineage, of their kings.

perhaps as that of any negro state, and probably not

at all inferior to that of the petty Latin kingdoms at
the dawn of history.
A trace of a similar state of things appears to survive
in Uganda, another great African monarchy. For
there the queen dowager and the queen sister are, or
rather were, allowed to have as many husbands as they
choose, and to dismiss them at the shortest notice. Yet
these women are not allowed under pain of death to
bear children. 1 Both the licence they enjoy and the
prohibition they are subject to may be explained if we
suppose that formerly the kingdom descended, as it still
does in Ashantee, first to the king's brothers and next to
the sons of his sisters. For in that case the next heirs
to the throne would be the sons of the king's mother
and of his sisters, and these women might accordingly
be allowed, as the king's sisters still are allowed in
Ashantee, to mate with any handsome man who took
their fancy, in order that their offspring might be men
of regal port. But when the line of descent was changed
from the female to the male line, in other words,
when the kings were succeeded by their sons instead of
by their brothers or their sisters' sons, then the king's
mother and his sisters would be forbidden to bear
children lest the descent of the crown to the king's own
children should be endangered by the existence of rivals
who, according to the old law of the kingdom, had a
better right to the throne. We may surmise that the
practice of putting the king's brothers to death at the

beginning of his reign, which survived till Uganda
passed under English protection,
1 was instituted at the
same time as the prohibition of child-bearing laid on the king's mother and sisters. The one custom got rid of
existing rivals ; the other prevented them from being
born. That the kingship in Uganda was formerly transmitted in the female line is strongly indicated by
the rule that the kings and the rest of the royal family
take their totems from their mothers, whereas all the
other people of the country get their totems from their
fathers. 2
In Loango the royal blood is traced in the female
line, and here also the princesses are free to choose and
divorce their husbands at pleasure. These husbands
are nearly always plebeians ; for princes and princesses, who are very numerous and form a ruling caste, may
not marry each other. The lot of a prince consort is
not a happy one, for he is rather the slave and prisoner
than the spouse of his imperious princess. When he
goes out he is preceded by guards who drive away all women from the road where he is to pass. If in
spite of these precautions he should by ill luck cast his
eyes on a woman, the princess may have his head
chopped off, and commonly exercises, or used to
exercise, the right. This sort of libertinism, sustained
by power, often carries women of the blood royal to
the greatest excesses, and nothing is so much dreaded

as their anger. No wonder that commoners in general
avoid the honour of a royal alliance. Only poor and
embarrassed men seek it as a protection against their
creditors and enemies. All the children of such a man
by such a wife are princes and princesses, and any one
of the princes may in time be chosen king ; for in
Loango the crown is not hereditary but elective. 1 Thus
it would seem that the father of the king of Loango
is nearly always a plebeian, and often little better than a
slave.
At Athens, as at Rome, we find traces of the same
mode of succession to the crown by marriage with a
royal princess ; for two of the most ancient kings of
Athens, namely, Cecrops and Amphictyon, are said to have married the daughters of their predecessors. 2 This
tradition is confirmed by the evidence, which I shall
adduce presently, that at Athens male kinship was pre
ceded by female kinship.
Further, if I am right in supposing that in ancient
Latium the royal families kept their daughters at home
and sent forth their sons to marry princesses and reign
among their wives' people, it will follow that the male
descendants would reign in successive generations over
different kingdoms. Now this seems to have happened
both in ancient Greece and in ancient Sweden ; from
which we may legitimately infer that it was a custom

practised by more than one branch of the Aryan stock
in Europe. I have to thank my friend Mr. H. M.
Chadwick for reminding me of the Greek, and for
informing me of the Swedish evidence. Take, for
instance, the great house of jEacus, the grandfather of
Achilles and Ajax. -fliacus himself reigned in ^gina,
but his descendants, as Pausanias justly observes, "from
the beginning went forth to other lands." l His son
Telamon migrated to the island of Salamis, married the
king's daughter, and reigned over the country. 2 Tela
mon's son Teucer, in his turn, migrated to Cyprus,
wedded the king's daughter, and succeeded his father
in-law on the throne.8 Again, Peleus, another son of
jEacus, quitted his native land and went away to
Phthia in Thessaly, where he received the hand of the
king's daughter, and with her a third of the kingdom. 4 Of Achilles, the son of Peleus, we are told that in his
youth he was sent to the court of Lycomedes, king of
Scyrus, where he became the father of Neoptolemus by
one of the princesses.
6 The tradition seems to show
that Achilles followed the custom of his family in
seeking his fortune in a foreign land. His son
Neoptolemus after him went away to Epirus, where he settled and became the ancestor of the kings of the
country. 6

Again, Tydeus was a son of GEneus, the king of
Calydon in ^Etolia, but he went to Argos and married the
king's daughter. 1 His son Diomede migrated to Daunia
in Italy, where he helped the king in a war with his
enemies, receiving as his reward the king's daughter in
marriage and part of his kingdom.2 As another
example we may take the family of the Pelopidae, whose tragic fortunes the Greek poets never wearied of
celebrating. Their ancestor was Tantalus, king of
Sipylus in Asia Minor. But his son Pelops passed into
Greece, won Hippodamia, the daughter of the king of Pisa, in the famous chariot race, and succeeded his
father-in law on the throne. 3 His son Atreus did not
remain in Pisa, but migrated to Mycenae, of which he
became king ;
4 and in the next generation Menelaus, son of Atreus, went to Sparta, where he married Helen,
the king's daughter, and himself reigned over that
country. 5 Further, it is very notable that, according to
the old lyric poets, Agamemnon himself, the elder
brother of Menelaus, reigned not at Mycenae but in
Lacedaemon, the native land of his wife Clytaemnestra,
and that he was buried at Amyclae, the ancient capital
of the country.6 Various reasons are assigned by ancient Greek

writers for these migrations of the princes. A common
one is that the king's son had been banished for murder.
This would explain very well why he fled his own land,
but it is no reason at all why he should become king of
another. We may suspect that such reasons are after
thoughts devised by writers who, accustomed to the
rule that a son should succeed to his father's property
and kingdom, were hard put to it to account for so
many traditions of kings' sons who quitted the land of
their birth to reign over a foreign kingdom. The evidence for the existence of a similar practice
in the old royal families of Sweden is being collected by
Mr. Chadwick ; I shall not say more on that head at
present. Thus it would seem that among some Aryan
peoples, at a certain stage of their social evolution, it
has been customary to regard women and not men as
the channels in which royal blood flows, and to bestow
the kingdom in each successive generation on a man
of another family, and often of another country, who
marries one of the princesses and reigns over his wife's
people. A common type of popular tale which relates
how an adventurer, coming to a strange land, wins the
hand of the king's daughter and the half or the whole
of the kingdom, may well be a reminiscence or a real
custom.
Where practices and ideas of this sort prevail, it is
obvious that the kingship is merely an appanage of marriage with a woman of the blood royal. The old
Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus puts this view of R



242 MARRIAGE WITH LECT.
the kingship very clearly in the mouth of Hermutrude,
a legendary queen of Scotland, and her statement is all
the more significant because, as we shall see presently,
it reflects the actual practice of the Pictish kings.
" Indeed she was a queen," says Hermutrude, " and
but that her sex gainsaid it, might be deemed a king ;
nay (and this is yet truer), whomsoever she thought worthy of her bed was at once a king, and she yielded
her kingdom with herself. Thus her sceptre and her
hand went together."
1 Wherever a custom of this
kind has prevailed, a man may clearly acquire the
kingdom just as well by marrying the widow as the
daughter of his predecessor. This is what jEgisthus did at Mycenae, and what Hamlet's uncle Feng and
Hamlet's successor Wiglet did in Denmark ; all three
slew their predecessors, married their widows, and then
sat peacefully on the throne. 2 The tame submission of
the people to their rule would be intelligible, if they
regarded the assassins, in spite of their crimes, as the
lawful occupants of the throne by reason of their
marriage with the widowed queens. Similarly Gyges
murdered Candaules, king of Lydia, married his widow,
and reigned over the country.8 Nor was this the only
instance of such a succession in the history of Lydia.
The wife of King Cadys conspired against his life with
her paramour Spermus, and though her husband
1 Saxo Grammaticus, Hhtoria Danica, bk. iv. p. 158, ed. P. E. MUller (p. 126 of
Elton's translation, quoted in the text). 2 The story of Hamlet (Amleth) is told in a striking form by Saxo Grammaticus in the third and fourth books of his history. Mr. H. M. Chadwick tells me that Hamlet stands on the border-line between legend and history. Hence the main outlines of his story may be correct. 8 Herodotus, i. 7-13.

recovered from the dose of poison which she adminis
tered to him, he died soon afterwards, and the conspira
tor married the widow and succeeded to the throne. 1
These cases excite a suspicion that in the royal house of
Lydia descent was traced in the female line, and the
suspicion is strengthened by the legendary character of Omphale, the ancestress of the dynasty. For she is
represented as a masculine and dissolute queen of the
Semiramis type, who wore male attire and put all her
lovers to death ; while on the other hand her consort
Hercules was her purchased slave, who was treated by
her with indignity and went about dressed as a woman. 2
This implies that the queen was a far more powerful
and important personage than the king, as would
naturally happen wherever it is the queen who confers
royalty on her consort at marriage, instead of receiving it from him. Hence we may conjecture that Herodotus
was wrong in saying that from Hercules to Candaules
the crown of Lydia had descended for twenty-two
generations from father to son.3
When Canute the Dane had been acknowledged
king of England, he married Emma, the widow of his
predecessor Ethel red, whose throne he had overturned
and whose children he had driven into exile. The
marriage has not unnaturally puzzled the historians; for Emma was much older than her second husband,

she was then living in Norniandy, and it is very doubt
ful whether Canute had ever seen her before she came
to be his bride. All, however, becomes plain if, as the
cases of Feng and Wiglet seem to show, it was an old
Danish custom that marriage with a king's widow
carried the kingdom with it as a matter of right. In
that case the young but prudent Canute married the
mature widow merely out of policy, in order to clinch,
according to Danish notions, by a legal measure his
claim to that crown which he had already won for
himself by the sword. 1
Among the Saxons and their near kinsmen the
Varini it appears to have been a regular custom for the
new king to marry his stepmother. Thus Hermigisil,
king of the Varini, on his deathbed enjoined his son
Radger to wed his stepmother in accordance with their
ancestral practice, and his injunction was obeyed. 2
Edbald, king of Kent, married his stepmother after the
death of his father Ethelbert ;
3 and as late as the ninth

vin FEMALE KINSHIP 245
To the view that the right to the Latin kingship
was derived from women and not from men, it may be
objected that the system of female kinship is unknown
among the Aryans, 1 and that even if faint traces of it
may be met with elsewhere, the last place in the world
where we should look for it would be Rome, the strong
hold of the patriarchal family. To meet this objection
it is necessary to point to some facts which appear to be
undoubted survivals among Aryan peoples of a custom
of tracing descent through the mother only. In Attica tradition ran that in old days paternity
was unknown, until Cecrops, the first king of Athens,
introduced the system of individual marriage. 2 Little
weight could be attached to this tradition if it were
not supported to a certain extent by the Attic usage
which always allowed a man to marry his half-sister
by the same father, but not his half-sister by the same
mother. 3 Such a rule seems clearly to be a relic of a
time when kinship was counted only through women.
Again, the Epizephyrian Locrians in Italy traced all ancestral distinction in the female, not the male line. 4
The Cantabrians of Spain seem also to have had female

kinship, for among them it was the daughters who inherited property and who portioned out their brothers
in marriage.
1
Further, the ancient Germans in the time of Tacitus
deemed the tie between a man and his sister's children
as close as that between a father and his own children ;
indeed, some regarded the bond as even closer and
more sacred, and therefore in exacting hostages they
chose the children of a man's sister rather than his own
children, believing that this gave them a firmer hold on
the family. 2 The superiority thus assigned to the maternal uncle over the father is an infallible mark of
female kinship, either present or past, as may be observed
in very many African tribes to this day, among whom
both property and political power pass, not from father to son, but from the maternal uncle to his nephews. 3
Amongst the Germans in the time of Tacitus, it is true,
a man's heirs were his own children, 4 but the mother's
brother could never have attained the position he held
except under a system of maternal descent.

them the kingdom was certainly transmitted through women. Bede tells us that down to his own time, in
the early part of the eighth century, whenever a doubt arose as to the succession, the Picts chose their king
from the female rather than the male line. 1 The state
meat is amply confirmed by historical evidence. For
we possess a list of the Pictish kings and their fathers
which was drawn up in the reign of Censed, king of
the Scots, towards the end of the tenth century ; and
for the period from the year 583 to the year 840 the
register is authenticated by the Irish Annals of Tiger
nach and Ulster. Now, it is significant that in this list
the fathers of the kings are never themselves kings ; in
other words, no king was succeeded on the throne by
his son. Further, if we may judge by their names,
the fathers of the Pictish kings were not Picts, but
foreigners, men of Irish, Cymric, or English race. The inference from these facts seems to be that among
the Picts the royal family was exogamous, and that the
crown descended in the female line ; in other words,
that the princesses married men of another clan or even
of another race, and that their issue by these strangers
sat on the throne, whether they succeeded in a prescribed
order according to birth, or were elected from among
the sons of princesses, as the words of Bede might be
taken to imply.2

Another European, though not Aryan, people among whom the system of female kinship appears to have
prevailed were the Etruscans. For in sepulchral in
scriptions the name of the mother of the deceased is
regularly recorded along with or even without the name
of the father ; and where the names of both father ind
mother are mentioned, greater prominence is given to
the mother's name by writing it in full, whereas the
father's name is, in accordance with Roman usage,
merely indicated by an initial. 1 The statement of
Theopompus, that among the Etruscans paternity was
unknown,2 may be only an exaggerated way of saying that they traced their descent through their mothers
and not through their fathers. Yet apparently in
Etruria, as elsewhere, this system of relationship was
combined with a real indifference to fatherhood, and
with the dissolute morals which that indifference
implies. 3 In these customs the Etruscans resembled the
Lydians, and the similarity confirms the common
opinion, which modern historians have too lightly set
aside, that the Etruscans were of Lydian origin. 4
However that may be, in considering the vestiges of

female kinship among the Latins, we shall do well to
bear in mind that the same archaic mode of tracing
descent appears to have prevailed among the neighbour
ing Etruscans, who not only exercised a powerful
influence on Rome, but gave her two, if not three, of
her kings. It would be neither unnatural nor surprising if among
the ancient Latins female kinship survived in the royal
family after it had been exchanged for male kinship
in all others. For royalty, like religion, is essentially conservative ; it clings to old forms and old customs
which have long vanished from ordinary life. Thus in
Uganda, as I have already mentioned, persons of royal blood still inherit their totems from their mothers,
while other people inherit them from their fathers. So
in Denmark and Scandinavia, as we have seen, the
kingdom would appear to have been transmitted through
women long after the family name and property had
become hereditary in the male line among the common
people. Sometimes the difference in custom between kings
and commoners is probably based rather on a distinction
of race than on varying degrees of social progress ; for
a dynasty is often a family of alien origin who have
imposed their rule on their subjects by force of arms, as
the Normans did on the Saxons, and the Manchus on
the Chinese. More rarely, perhaps, it may have
happened that from motives of policy or superstition
a conquering tribe has left a nominal kingship to the
members of the old royal house. Such a concession



250 PLEBEIAN KINGS LECT.
would be most likely to be made where the functions
of the king were rather religious than civil, and where
the prosperity of the country was supposed to depend on the maintenance of the established relations between
the people and the gods of the land. In that case the
new-comers, not knowing how to appease and conciliate
these strange deities, might be glad to let the priestly
kings of the conquered race perform the quaint rites and mumble the old spells, which had been found to
answer their purpose time out of mind. In a common
wealth like the Roman, formed by the union of different
stocks, the royal family might thus belong either to
the conquerors or to the conquered ; in other words,
either to the patricians or to the plebeians. But if we
leave out of account Romulus and Tatius, who are more
or less legendary figures, and the two Tarquins, who came of a noble Etruscan house, all the other Roman
kings appear from their names to have been men of
plebeian, not patrician, families. 1 Hence it seems
probable that they belonged to the indigenous race, who may have retained mother -right, at least in the
royal succession, after they had submitted to invaders
who knew father-right only. If this was so, it confirms the view that the old
Roman kingship was essentially a religious office ; for the conquerors would be much more ready to leave an
office of this sort in the hands of the conquered than a
kingship of the type with which we are familiar. " Let
these puppets/* they might think, "render to the gods

their dues, while we rule the people in peace and lead
them in war." Of such priestly kings Numa was the
type. But not all of his successors were willing to
model themselves on his saintly figure, and, rejecting
the pomps and vanities of earth, to devote themselves
to communion with heaven. Some were men of strong
will and warlike temper, who could not brook the dull
routine of the cloister. They longed to exchange the
stillness and gloom of the temple or the sacred grove
for the sunshine, the dust, and the tumult of the battle
field. Such men broke bounds, and when they
threatened to get completely out of hand and turn the
tables on the patricians, it was time for them to go.
This, we may conjecture, was the real meaning of the
abolition of the kingship at Rome. It put an end to
the solemn pretence that the state was still ruled by the
ancient owners of the soil : it took the shadow of power
from them and gave it to those who had long possessed
the substance. The ghost of the monarchy had begun
to walk and grow troublesome : the revolution laid it
for centuries.
But though the effect of the revolution was to sub
stitute the real rule of the patricians for the nominal
rule of the plebeians, the break with the past was at the
outset less complete than it seems. For the first two
consuls were both men of the royal blood. One of
them, L. Junius Brutus, was sister's son of the expelled King Tarquin the Proud. 1 As such he would have
been the heir to the throne under a strict system of

female kinship. The other consul, L. Tarquinius
Collatinus, was a son of the late king's cousin Egerius.
1
These facts suggest that the first intention of the
revolutionaries was neither to abolish the kingship nor
to wrest it from the royal family, but merely, retaining
the hereditary monarchy, to restrict its powers. To achieve this object they limited the tenure of office to a
year, and doubled the number of kings, who might
thus be expected to check and balance each other. But
it is not impossible that both restrictions were merely
the revival of old rules which the growing power of
the kings had contrived for a time to set aside in
practice. The legends of Romulus and Remus, and
afterwards of Romulus and Tatius, may be real reminis
cences of a double kingship like that of Sparta ;
2 and
in the yearly ceremony of the Regifugium or Flight of the King we seem to detect a trace of an annual, not a
lifelong, tenure of office. The same thing may perhaps be true of the parallel change which took place at
Athens when the people deprived the Medontids of their
regal powers and reduced them from kings to responsible
magistrates, who held office at first for life, but after
wards only for periods of ten years. 3 Here, too, the
limitation of the tenure of the kingship may have been
merely the reinforcement of an old custom which had
fallen into abeyance. At Rome, however, the attempt

vin TARQUIN THE PROUD 253
to maintain the hereditary principle, if it was made at
all, was almost immediately abandoned, and the patricians
openly transferred to themselves the double kingship,
which thenceforth was purely elective, and was after
wards known as the consulship.
1
The history of the last king of Rome, Tarquin the Proud, leads us to surmise that the offence which he
gave by his ambitious and domineering character was
heightened by an attempt to shift the succession of the
kingship from the female to the male line. He himself
united both claims in his own person ; for he had
married the daughter of his predecessor, Servius Tullius,
and he was the son or grandson of Tarquin the Elder, 2
who preceded Servius Tullius on the throne. But in
asserting his right to the crown, if we can trust Roman
history on this point, Tarquin the Proud entirely ignored his claim through women as the son-in-law of his pre
decessor, and insisted only on his claim in the male line
as the son or grandson of a former king.
3 And he
evidently intended to bequeath the kingdom to one of his sons ; for he put out of the way two of the men who,
if the succession had been through women in the way I
have indicated, would have been entitled to sit on the
throne before his own sons, and even before himself.
1 The two supreme magistrates who replaced the kings were at first called praetors. See Livy, iii. 55. 12 j B. G. Niebuhr, History of Rome * i. 520 qy. ; Th.

recognised by Livy (ii. i. 7 tq.). * It was a disputed point whether Tarquin the Proud was the son or grandson of Tarquin the Elder. See Livy, 5. 46. 4 ; Dionysius Halicarn. Ant. Rom. iv. 6 if.

One of these was his sister's husband, the other was her
elder son. Her younger son, the famous Lucius
Junius Brutus, only escaped the fate of his father and
elder brother by feigning, like Hamlet, imbecility, and
thus deluding his wicked uncle into the belief that he
had nothing to fear from such a simpleton. 1 This
design of Tarquin to alter the line of succession from
the female to the male side of the house may have been
the last drop which filled his cup of high-handed tyranny
to overflowing. At least it is a strange coincidence, if
it is nothing more, that he was deposed by the man
who, under a system of female kinship, was the rightful heir, and who in a sense actually sat on the throne from
which he pushed his uncle. For the curule chair of the
consul was little less than the king's throne under a
limited tenure.
It has often been asked whether the Roman monarchy
was hereditary or elective. The question implies an opposition between the two modes of succession which
by no means necessarily exists. As a matter of fact in
many African tribes at the present day the succession to
the kingdom or chieftainship is determined by a com
bination of the hereditary and the elective principle ;
that is, the kings or chiefs are chosen by the people or
a body of electors from among the members of the
royal family. And as the chiefs have commonly several

wives and many children by them, the number of
possible candidates may be not inconsiderable. To
take a single instance out of many, we are told that
" the government of the Banyai is rather peculiar, being
a sort of feudal republicanism. The chief is elected,
and they choose the son of the deceased chief's sister in
preference to his own offspring. When dissatisfied
with one candidate, they even go to a distant tribe for
a successor, who is usually of the family of the late chief,
a brother, or a sister's son, but never his own son or
daughter." l Sometimes the field of choice is extended still further
by a rule that the chief may or must be chosen from
one of several families in a certain order. Thus among
the Bangalas of the Cassange Valley in Angola the chief is elected from three families in rotation.2 And
Diagara, a country bordering on Senegambia, is ruled by an absolute monarch who is chosen alternately from
two families, one of whom lives in one place and the
other in another. 8
Among the Yorubas in western Africa the principal
chief is always taken from one or more families which
have the hereditary right of furnishing the community with rulers. In many cases the succession passes with
established regularity from one to a second family
alternately ; but in one instance, apparently unique, the

right of succession to the chiefly primacy seems to be
possessed by four princely families, from each of which
the head chief is elected in rotation. The principle of
primogeniture is not necessarily followed in the election,
but the choice of the electors must always fall on one who
is related to a former chief in the male line. For paternal
descent alone is recognised in Yorubaland, where even
the greatest chief may take to wife a woman of the
lowest rank. Sometimes the choice of the ruling chief
is made by divine authority, intimated to the people
through the high priest of the principal god of the
district. 1
Among the Igaras, on the lower Niger, the royal
family is divided into four branches, each of which pro
vides a king in turn. The capital and its district, both
of which bear the name of Idah, are always occupied by
the reigning branch of the royal family, while the three
other branches, not being allowed to live there, retreat
into the interior. Hence at the death of a king a double
change takes place. On the one hand, the late reigning
family, with all their dependents, have to leave the
homes in which many of them have been born and
brought up, and to migrate to towns in the forest,
which they know only by name. On the other hand,
the new reigning family comes in to the capital, and
their people settle in the houses occupied by their fore
fathers four reigns ago. The king is generally elected
by the leading men of his branch of the royal family :

they choose the richest and most powerful man of their
number. 1
Thus the mere circumstance that all the Roman
kings, with the exception of the two Tarquins, appear
to have belonged to different families, is not of itself
conclusive against the view that heredity was one of the
elements which determined the succession. The number
of families from whom the king might be elected may
have been large. And even if, as is possible, the
electors were free to choose a king without any regard
to his birth, the hereditary principle would still be main
tained if, as we have seen reason to conjecture, it was
essential that the chosen candidate should marry a
woman of the royal house, who would generally be
either the daughter or the widow of his predecessor.
In this way the apparently disparate principles of unfettered election and strict heredity would be combined :
the marriage of the elected king with the hereditary
princess would furnish the link between the two.
Under such a system, to put it otherwise, the kings are
elective and the queens hereditary. This is just the
converse of what happens under a system of male kinship,
where the kings are hereditary and the queens elective.
In the later days of Rome it was held that the
ancient custom had been for the people to elect the
kings and for the senate to ratify the election. 2 But

we may suspect, with Mommsen, that this was no more
than an inference from the mode of electing the consuls.
The magistrates who, under the republic, represented the kings most closely were the dictator and the King
of the Sacred Rites, and neither of these was elected by
the people. Both were nominated, the dictator by the
consul, and the King of the Sacred Rites by the chief
pontiff.
1 Accordingly it seems probable that under the
monarchy the king was nominated either by his pre
decessor or, failing that, by an interim king (interrex)
chosen from the senate. 2 Now if, as we have been led
to think, an essential claim to the throne was constituted
by marriage with a princess of the royal house, nothing would be more natural than that the king should choose
his successor, who would commonly be his son-in-law.
If he had several sons-in-law and had omitted to desig
nate the one who was to reign after him, the election
would be made by his substitute, the interim king.
The personal qualities which recommended a man
for a royal alliance and succession to the throne would
naturally vary according to the popular ideas of the time and the personal character of the king or his sub
stitute ; but it is reasonable to suppose that among
them in early society physical strength and beauty
would hold a prominent place. We have seen that in

Ashantee the husbands of the princesses must always be
men of fine presence, because they are to be the fathers
of future kings. Among the Ethiopians in antiquity, as among the Ashantees and many other African tribes
to this day, the crown passed in the female line to the
son of the king's sister, but if there was no such heir
they chose the handsomest and most valiant man to
reign over them. 1
We are told that the Gordioi elected the fattest
man to the kingship,2 nor is this incredible when
we remember that in Africa corpulence is still regarded
as a great distinction and beauty, and that both the
chiefs and their wives are sometimes so fat that they
can hardly walk. Thus among the Caffres, chiefs
and rich men attain to an enormous bulk, and the
queens fatten themselves on beef and porridge, of which
they partake freely in the intervals of slumber. To be
fat is with them a mark of wealth and therefore of high
rank : common folk cannot afford to eat and drink and
lounge as much as they would like to do. 8
The Syrakoi in antiquity are reported to have bestowed the crown on the tallest man or on the man

probably the same with the long-headed people described
by Hippocrates, who says that among them the men with the longest heads were esteemed the noblest, and
that they applied bandages and other instruments to the
heads of their children in infancy for the sake of mould
ing them into the shape which they admired. 1 Such
reports are probably by no means fabulous, for among the Monbuttu or Mang-bettou of central Africa down
to this day " when the children of chiefs are young,
string is wound round their heads, which are gradually
compressed into a shape that will allow of the longest
head-dress. The skull thus treated in childhood takes
the appearance of an elongated egg." 2 Similarly some of the Indian tribes on the north-west coast of America
artificially mould the heads of their children into the
shape of a wedge or sugar-loaf by compressing them between boards : some of them regard such heads as a
personal beauty, others as a mark of high birth. 3

kingdom. His tomb was said to be at the point of
the race-course from which the runners started. 1 The
famous story of Pelops and Hippodamia is perhaps only another version of the legend that the first races
at Olympia were run for no less a prize than the
crown. Other traditions were current in antiquity of
princesses who were offered in marriage to the fleetest
runner and won by the victor in the race. Thus
I cari us at Sparta set the wooers of his daughter
Penelope to run a race : Ulysses won and wedded her.
His father-in-law is said to have tried to induce him to
take up his abode in Sparta ; which seems to show that
if Ulysses had accepted the invitation he would have
inherited the kingdom through his wife.2 So, too, the
Libyan king Antaeus placed his beautiful daughter Barce at the end of the race-course : her many noble
suitors, both Libyans and foreigners, ran to her as the
goal, and Alcidamus, who touched her first, gained her
in marriage. 3 Danaus, also, at Argos is said to have
stationed his daughters at the goal, and the runner who
reached them first had first choice of a wife. 4 These
traditions may very well reflect a real custom of racing
for a bride, for such a custom appears to have pre
vailed among various peoples, though in practice
it has commonly degenerated into a mere form or
pretence.

262 CONTESTS FOR A BRIDE LECT.
But the contests for a bride may be designed to try
the skill, strength, and courage of the suitors as well as
their horsemanship and speed of foot. In the great Indian epic of the Mahabharata it is related that the
hand of the lovely princess Draupadi, daughter of the king of the Panchalas, was only to be won by him who
could bend a certain mighty bow, and shoot five arrows
through a revolving wheel, so as to hit the target beyond. After many wooers had essayed the task in
vain, the disguised Arjun was successful, and carried
off the princess to be his wife. 1 This was an instance
of the ancient Indian practice of the Svayamvara, in
accordance with which a maiden of high rank either
chose her husband from among her assembled suitors
or was offered as the prize to the conqueror in a trial
of skill. The custom was occasionally observed among
the Rajputs down to a late time. 2 In the Niebelungenlied
the fair Brunhild, queen of Iceland, was only to be won
in marriage by him who could beat her in three trials
of strength, and the unsuccessful wooers forfeited their
heads. Many had thus perished, but at last Gunther,
king of the Burgundians, vanquished and married her. 3 It is said that Sithon, king of the Odomanti in
Thrace, had a lovely daughter Pallene, and that many

VIII CONTESTS FOR KINGSHIP 263
men came courting her from far and near. But her
father said that he who would wed his daughter must
first fight himself and pay with his life the penalty of
defeat. Thus he slew many young men. But when
he was grown old and his strength had failed, he set
two of the wooers to fight each other for the kingdom
and the hand of the princess. One of them slew the
other and married the king's daughter. 1
Thus it appears that the right to marry a girl, and
especially a princess, has often been conferred as a prize
in an athletic contest. There would be no reason,
therefore, for surprise if the Roman kings, before
bestowing their daughters in marriage, should have resorted to this ancient mode of testing the personal
qualities of their future sons-in-law and successors. If
my theory is correct, the Roman king and queen
personated Jupiter and his divine consort, and in the
character of these divinities went through the annual
ceremony of a sacred marriage for the purpose of causing the crops to grow and men and cattle to be
fruitful and multiply. Thus they did what in more
northern lands we may suppose the King and Queen
of May were believed to do in days of old. Now we
have seen in a former lecture 2 that the right to play the
part of the King of May and to mate with the Queen
of May has sometimes been determined by an athletic
contest, particularly by a race. This contest may have

264 THE KING'S FLIGHT LECT. vm
been a relic of an old marriage custom of the sort we
have examined, a custom designed to test the fitness of
a candidate for matrimony. Such a test might reason
ably be applied with peculiar rigour to the king in order to ensure that no personal defect should in
capacitate him for the performance of those sacred
rites and ceremonies on which, even more than on the
despatch of his civil and military duties, the safety and
prosperity of the community were believed to depend.
A
relic of that test perhaps survived at Rome in the
ceremony known as the Regifugium or Flight of the King, which continued to be annually observed down to
imperial times. On the twenty-fourth day of February a sacrifice used to be offered in the Comitium, and
when it was over the King of the Sacred Rites fled
from the Forum. 1 I conjecture that the Flight of the
King was originally a race for an annual kingship, which may have been awarded as a prize to the fleetest
runner. At the end of the year the king might run
again for a second term of office ; and so on, until he
was defeated and deposed or perhaps slain. In time a
man of masterful character might succeed in seating
himself permanently on the throne and reducing the
annual race or flight to the empty form which it seems
always to have been within historical times.

LECTURE IX
The King's Flight at Rome in relation to the Saturnalia Human
representatives of Saturn killed at the Saturnalia Violent deaths of Roman kings Saturn and Jupiter Summary of
conclusions as to the King of the Wood at Nemi He represented Jupiter or Janus and mated with Diana Janus or Dianus and Diana the equivalents of Jupiter and Juno Reasons for putting the divine king to death The King of Calicut an Indian parallel to the King of the Wood at Nemi.
IN the last lecture I gave some reasons for thinking
that at Rome the old kings belonged to the indigenous and conquered race, and that the right to the throne
was transmitted through women, being enjoyed by the
man who married a princess of the royal house after
proving his fitness for office in an athletic contest of
strength or speed. Of that contest I conjectured that
the ceremony known as the Regifugium or Flight of the King may have been a survival. If my theory is
correct, the yearly Flight of the King is a relic of a
time when the kingship was an annual office awarded,
along with the hand of a princess, to the victorious
athlete or gladiator, who thereafter figured along with
his bride as a god and goddess at a sacred marriage
designed to ensure the fertility of the earth by homoeo
pathic magic. 265



266 THE SATURNALIA LECT.
Accepting this theory as a provisional hypothesis, we have still to ask whether or not the Flight of the King
was immediately connected in point of time with the
ceremony of the Sacred Marriage. As to this, it is to
be observed that the date of the King's Flight, namely,
the twenty-fourth of February, was within four days of the close of the old Roman year, which ended with
February long before it ended with December. Now,
in later times, when the year began with January, the
festival of the Saturnalia was held in December, from
the seventeenth to the twenty-third of the month. 1
But the analogy of similar festivals elsewhere makes it
probable that the Saturnalia always fell at or near the
end of the year ; so that when February was the last
month of the calendar, the Saturnalia might be expected
to be celebrated in it rather than in December. On
this theory the date of the Saturnalia in the old Roman
calendar ought to be the seventeenth to the twenty
third of February. But the Flight of the King fell on
the twenty-fourth of February, that is on the very day
after the Saturnalia, if my hypothesis as to the original
date of that festival is correct. This accords perfectly
with all that we know of similar festivals. For their
outstanding features appear to have been, first, a general
license accorded to the whole population, including
slaves as well as freemen ; second, the temporary reign
of a sacred King or Lord of Misrule ; third, the
marriage of the merry monarch to a woman who
1 On the Saturnalia, see L. Preller, Rtmische Mythologie? ii. 15 sq q. ; Dezobry, Rome au siecle d'Auguste? iii. 143 sqq.



ix THE SATURNALIA 267
personated a goddess; and, fourth, the deposition or violent death of the king.
1 If the analogy of these
festivals held good for Rome, we should accordingly
have to suppose that the King's Flight at the end of
the Saturnalia was a substitute for his deposition or
death ; in other words, that instead of being killed out
of hand he was allowed to run for his life, and that if
he showed a clean pair of heels to his pursuers and com
petitors he was permitted to live and reign another year.
Now this theory in all its details receives most
remarkable confirmation from an ancient account of
the Saturnalia which was discovered and published a few
years ago by Professor F. Cumont of Ghent. From
that account we learn that down to the beginning of
the fourth century of our era, that is, down nearly to
the establishment of Christianity by Constantine, the Roman soldiers stationed on the Danube were wont to
celebrate the Saturnalia in a barbarous fashion which
must certainly have dated from a very remote antiquity.
Thirty days before the festival they chose by lot from
among themselves a young and handsome man, who
was dressed in royal robes to resemble the god Saturn.
In that character he was allowed to indulge all his
passions to the fullest extent ; but when his brief reign
of thirty days was over, and the festival of Saturn was
come, he had 1 to cut his own throat on the altar of the
god he personated. 2

268 THE SATURNALIA LECT.
In this very notable custom we have not merely the
personation of the god Saturn by a man and the violent
death of the man-god ; we have also a clear trace of
the Sacred Marriage in the licence accorded to the
human representative of the deity, a licence which, on
my theory, is strictly analogous to the old orgies of May Day and other similar festivals. Observe that
Saturn was the god of the seed, and the Saturnalia
the festival of sowing.
1 How an Italian festival of
sowing could fall in midwinter has always been a
puzzle. But the difficulty vanishes as soon as we
perceive that in the old calendar the date of the
celebration must have been not December but
February ; for in Italy the month of February
is, along with March, the great season of the spring
sowing. 2 Nothing therefore could be more natural
than that the god of the seed should hold his festival
at that time of the year. And on the principles of
homoeopathic magic nothing could be more natural than that at the season of sowing the marriage of
the powers of vegetation should be simulated by the
marriage of human beings for the purpose of sympa
thetically quickening the growth of the seed. 3 In short, no time could be more suitable for the celebra
tion of the Sacred Marriage. At all events, the view
that the King's Flight on the twenty - fourth of

ix VIOLENT ENDS OF KINGS 269
February was a mitigation of an older custom of
putting him to death is strongly confirmed by the
evidence that in the old calendar the ceremony followed
immediately after the Saturnalia, and that the King of
the Saturnalia, as he was called, had formerly to cut
his own throat in public at the end of his brief reign.
If I am right in supposing that in very early times
the old Latin kings personated a god and were regularly put to death in that character, a new light is thrown on
the mysterious or violent ends to which so many of the
Roman monarchs are said to have come. Too much
stress should not, however, be laid on such legends,
for, in a turbulent state of society, kings, like com
moners, are apt to be knocked on the head for much
sounder reasons than a claim to divinity. Still it is
worth while to note that Romulus is said to have
vanished mysteriously or to have been cut to pieces by
the patricians whom he had offended ;
l and further,
that the seventh of July, the day on which he perished,
was a festival which bore some resemblance to the
Saturnalia. For on that day the female slaves were
allowed to take certain remarkable liberties. They
dressed up as free women in the attire of matrons and
maids, and in this guise they went forth from the city,
scoffed and jeered at all whom they met, and engaged
among themselves in a fight, striking and throwing stones at each other. Moreover, they feasted under a
wild fig tree, made use of a rod cut from the tree,

perhaps to beat each other with, and offered the milky
juice of the tree in sacrifice to Juno Caprotina, whose
name appears to mean either the goddess of the goat
(caper) or the goddess of the wild fig tree ; for the
Romans called a wild fig tree a goat-fig (caprificus}. Hence the day was called the Nonae Caprotinae, after
the animal or the tree. The festival was not peculiar
to Rome, but was held by women throughout Latium. 1
It can hardly be dissociated from a custom which was
observed by ancient husbandmen at this season. They
sought to fertilise the fig trees or to ripen the figs by
hanging among the boughs of the trees strings of fruit
taken from a wild fig tree. The practice appears to be
very old. It has been employed in Greece both in
ancient and modern times, and Roman writers often
refer to it. Palladius recommends the solstice in June
as the best time for the operation ; Columella prefers
July.

fig tree, see Graf zu Solms - Laubach, " Die Herkunft, Domestication und
Verbreitung des gewohnlichen Feigenbaums " (Ficus Carica, L.), Abhandlungen der ktiniglichen Gucllichaft der fttssenschaften za GOttingen, xxviii. (1882), pp. 1-106. This last writer thinks that the operation was not practised by Italian husbandmen, because it is not mentioned by Cato and Varro. But their silence can hardly outweigh the express mention and recommendation of it by Palladius and Columella. Theophrastus, it ia true, says that the process was not in use in Italy (Hist. Plantarum, ii. 8. i), but he can scarcely have had exact information on the subject.
Caprificatio, as it is called, is still employed by the Neapolitan peasantry, though it
seems to be unknown in northern Italy. It is practised in Morocco on Midsummer Day, bunches of figs from the male trees being then hung in straw on the female



ix FERTILISATION OF THE FIG 271
fig tree is a female, and the fertilisation is effected by
insects which are engendered in the fruit of the male
tree and convey the pollen to the blossom of the
female.1 Thus the placing of wild figs, laden with
pollen and insects, among the boughs of the cultivated
fig is, like the artificial fertilisation of the date-palm,
a real marriage of the trees ; and it may well have
been regarded as such by the peasants of antiquity long before the true theory of the process was dis
covered.
Now the fig is an important article of diet in
countries bordering on the Mediterranean. When
Sandanis the Lydian attempted to dissuade Croesus
from marching against the Persians, he represented to him that there was nothing to be gained by con
quering the inhabitants of a barren country who
neither drank wine nor ate figs.
2 An Arab com
mentator on the Coran observes that " God swears
by these two trees, the fig and the olive, because among
trees (Budgett Meakin, The Moors (London, 1902), p. 258). The Latin name ' goat-fig
"
(caprificus) applied to the wild fig tree may well be derived from the notion that the tree is a male who mates with the female tree. Similarly, the
Messenians called the tree limply " he-goat "
(rpdyos). See Pausanias, iv. 20. 1-3. 1 A. Engler, in V. Hehn's Kulturpjlanzen und Hauithiere"* (Berlin, 1902), p. 99. Compare Graf ru Solms-Laubach, op. cit. Professor H. Marshall Ward has
furnished me with an exact description of the process, which will be printed in thr third edition of The Golden Bough. The ancients were well aware of the production of the insects in the wild fig tree and their transference to the cultivated fig tree. Sometimes, instead of fertilising the trees by hand, they contented themselves with planting wild fig tree* near cultivated fig trees, so that the fertilisation was effected by the wind, which blew the insects from the male to the female trees.

272 DEATH OF ROMULUS LECT.
fruit trees they surpass all the rest. They relate that a
basket of figs was offered to the prophet Mohammed,
and when he had eaten one he bade his comrades do
the same, saying,
* Truly, if I were to say that any
fruit had come down from Paradise, I would say it of
the fig/
"
l Hence it would be natural that a process
supposed, not without reason, to be essential to the
ripening of a favourite fruit should be the occasion of
a popular festival. We may surmise that the licence
allowed to slave women on this day formed part of an
ancient Saturnalia which was supposed to fertilise the
figs by homoeopathic magic. The association of the death of Romulus with the
festival of the wild fig tree can hardly be accidental,
especially as he and his twin-brother were said to have
been suckled by the she-wolf under a fig tree, which
was always shown as one of the sacred objects of the
city and received offerings of milk down to late times. 2
The clue to the association is probably furnished by the
old belief that the king is responsible for the fruits of
the earth. We may conjecture that in like manner the
Roman king was expected to make the fig trees
blossom and bear figs, and that in order to do so he
went through a form of Sacred Marriage on the July

ix VIOLENT ENDS OF KINGS 273
day when the husbandmen resorted to a more efficacious
means of producing the same result. The ceremony
of the Sacred Marriage need not have been restricted
to a single day in the year. It may well have been
repeated for many different crops and fruits. If the
queen of Athens was annually married to the god of
the vine, why should not the king of Rome have
wedded the goddess of the fig ?
We have still to ask, Why should the king's wed
ding-day be also the day of his death ? The problem
cannot be solved till the wider question has been
answered, Why has it been customary to slay the divine
king or human god ? That question I shall endeavour
briefly to answer a little later on. Here I will only
say that elsewhere the marriage of the sacred king or
divine man has been often followed at a brief interval
by his violent death.
Another Roman king who perished by violence was
Tatius, the Sabine colleague of Romulus. It is said
that he was at Lavinium offering a public sacrifice to
the ancestral gods, when some men to whom he had
given umbrage despatched him with the sacrificial knives
and spits which they had snatched from the altar. 1
The occasion and the manner of his death suggest
that the slaughter may have been a sacrifice rather
than an assassination. Tullus Hostilius was commonly
said to have been killed by lightning, but many held
that he was murdered at the instigation of his successor

Ancus Marcius.1 Speaking of Numa, Plutarch observes
that " his fame was enhanced by the fortunes of the
later kings. For of the five who reigned after him the
last was deposed and ended his life in exile ; and of the
remaining four not one died a natural death, for three
of them were assassinated and Tullus Hostilius was
consumed by thunderbolts." This implies that King
Ancus Marcius, as well as Tarquin the Elder and
Servius Tullius, perished by the hand of an assassin.
No other ancient historian, so far as I know, records
this of Ancus Marcius, though one of them says that
the king " was carried off by an untimely death."
Tarquin the Elder was slain by two murderers whom
the sons of his predecessor, Ancus Marcius, had hired
to do the deed. 4
Lastly, Servius Tullius came by his
end in circumstances which, as Mr. A. B. Cook was
the first to point out, recall the combat for the priest
hood of Diana at Nemi. He was attacked by his
successor and killed by his orders, though not by his
hand. Moreover, he lived among the oak groves of
the Esquiline Hill at the head of the Slope of Virbius,
and it was here, beside a sanctuary of Diana, that he
was slain. 5

ix ORDEAL OF BATTLE 275
kings suggest that the contest by which they gained the crown may sometimes have been a mortal combat
rather than a race. It would not be surprising if
among the early Latins the claim to the kingdom
should often have been settled by single combat ; for
down to historical times their kinsfolk the Umbrians
regularly submitted their private disputes to the ordeal
of battle, and he who cut his adversary's throat was
thought thereby to have proved the justice of his cause
beyond the reach of cavil. 1
A
parallel to what I conceive to have been the rule
of the old Latin kingship is furnished by a West
African custom of to-day. When the king of the
northern province of Congo has been elected, he has
to take his stand at a large tree near the entrance to
a sacred grove. Here, encouraged by one of his
ministers, he must fight all rivals who present them
selves to dispute his right to the throne. 2 In England
down to the nineteenth century we had a relic of a
similar custom in the champion who at the corona
tion of a king or queen threw down his glove and
challenged to mortal combat all who disputed the king's or queen's right to the crown. I believe the practice
was discontinued for the first time at the coronation of
1 Nicolaus Damascenus, in Stobarus, Florilfgium, x. 70 ; Fragmenta Hiitoricomm Graecorum, ed. C. MUller, iii. 457. Compare H. Jordan, Die KSnige im alien Italien (Berlin, 1887), pp. 44 tq. In this his last work Jordan argues that the Umbrian practice, combined with the rule of the Arician priesthood, throws light on the existence and nature of the kingship among the ancient Latins. I am happy to agree with so learned and judicious a scholar. * From an unpublished manuscript of Mr. R. E. Dennct in the possession of the Folk-lore Society. I have to thank Mr. N. W. Thomas for his kindness in copying out and sending me the passage, of which I have given the substance in the text.

his present Majesty. So tenacious is royalty of forms
that may be traced back to a barbarous antiquity.
Pepys in his Diary describes as an eyewitness the cere
mony of the challenge at the coronation of Charles the
Second. He says, "And many fine ceremonies there
was of the heralds leading up people before him, and
bowing ; and my Lord of Albemarle's going to the
kitchen and eating a bit of the first dish that was to go
to the King's table. But, above all, was these three
Lords, Northumberland and Suffolk, and the Duke of
Ormond, coming before the courses on horseback and
staying so all dinner-time, and at last bringing up
(Dymock) the King's Champion, all in armour on horseback, with his speare and targett carried before
him. And a Herald proclaims c That if any dare deny
Charles Stewart to be lawful King of England, here was
a Champion that would fight with him '
; and with these
words, the Champion flings down his gauntlet, and all this he do three times in his going up towards the
King's table. To which when he is come, the King
drinks to him, and then sends him the cup, which is of
gold, and he drinks it off, and then rides back again
with the cup in his hand." l
In the foregoing inquiry we have seen reason to
suppose that the Roman kings personated not only
Jupiter, the god of the oak, but also Saturn, the god
of the seed. The question naturally arises, Did they do
so simultaneously or successively ? In other words, Did

the same king represent Jupiter at one time of the year and Saturn at another ? or did the kings of a certain
period or a certain dynasty represent Jupiter only, while
the kings of another period or another dynasty personated Saturn alone ? The documents at our disposal
do not allow us to answer these questions definitely.
But tradition certainly points to the conclusion that in
Latium and perhaps in Italy generally Saturn was an
older god than Jupiter, just as in Greece Cronus appears
to have preceded Zeus. Saturn and Cronus were per
haps the gods of an indigenous and agricultural people; while Zeus and Jupiter were the deities of a ruder
invading race, who swarmed down into the fertile lands
of Greece and Italy from the forests of central Europe,
bringing their sylvan divinities with them, and displacing
the ancient native god of the seed by their own imported
god of the oak and the thunder. If that was so, we
may suppose that before the incursion of these northern
barbarians the old kings of Greece and Italy personated
Cronus and Saturn, but that after the conquest they or
their successors adopted the gods of the conquerors
and played the parts of Zeus and Jupiter. However, as I have said, the evidence is too scanty to allow
of a positive decision in a matter of so much
obscurity. This must conclude our examination of the sacred
character of the early Latin kings in general.
I propose now to recapitulate the conclusions to
which the inquiry has thus far led us, and drawing



278 PRIMmVE MAGIC LECT.
together the scattered rays of light to turn them on
the dark figure of the priest of Nemi.
We have found that at an early stage of society
men, ignorant of the secret processes of nature and
of the narrow limits within which it is in our power
to control and direct them, have commonly arrogated
to themselves functions which in the present state
of knowledge we should deem superhuman or divine.
The illusion has been fostered and maintained by the
same causes which begot it, namely, the marvellous
order and uniformity with which Nature conducts her
operations, the wheels of her great machine revolving with a smoothness and precision which enable the
patient observer to anticipate in general the season, if
not the very hour, when they will bring round the fulfil
ment of his hopes or the accomplishment of his fears.
The regularly recurring events of this great cycle, or rather series of cycles, soon stamp themselves even
on the dull mind of the savage. He foresees them,
and foreseeing them mistakes the desired recurrence
for an effect of his own will, and the dreaded recurrence
for an effect of the will of his enemies. Thus the
springs which set the vast machine in motion, though
they lie far beyond our ken, shrouded in a mystery
which we can never hope to penetrate, appear to ignorant man to lie within his reach : he fancies he can
touch them and so work by magic art all manner of
good to himself and evil to his foes. In time the
fallacy of this belief becomes apparent to him : he
discovers that there are things he cannot do, pleasures



ix EVOLUTION OF KINGS 279
which he is unable of himself to procure, pains which
even the most potent magician is powerless to avoid. The unattainable good, the inevitable ill, are now
ascribed by him to the action of invisible powers, whose
favour is joy and life, whose anger is misery and death.
Thus magic tends to be displaced by religion, and the
sorcerer by the priest. At this stage of thought the
ultimate causes of things are conceived to be personal
beings, many in number and often discordant in charac
ter, who partake of the nature and even of the frailty of
man, though their might is greater than his, and their
life far exceeds the span of his ephemeral existence.
Their sharply marked individualities, their clear-cut
outlines have not yet begun, under the powerful solvent
of philosophy, to melt and coalesce into that single
unknown substratum of phenomena, which, according
to the qualities with which our imagination invests it,
goes by one or other of the high-sounding names
which the wit of man has devised to hide his ignorance.
Accordingly, so long as men look on their gods as
beings akin to themselves and not raised to an un
approachable height above them, they believe it to be
possible for those of their number who surpass their
fellows to attain to divine rank after death, or even in
life. Incarnate human deities of this latter sort may be
said to halt midway between the age of magic and the
age of religion. If they bear the names and display the
pomp of deities, the powers which they are supposed to
wield are commonly those of their predecessor the
magician. Like him, they are expected to guard their

people against hostile enchantments, to heal them in
sickness, to bless them with offspring, and to provide
them with an abundant supply of food by regulating
the weather and performing the other ceremonies which
are deemed necessary to ensure the fertility of the earth
and the multiplication of animals. Men who are credited
with powers so lofty and far-reaching naturally hold the highest place in the land, and while the rift between the
spiritual and the temporal spheres has not yet deepened
too far, they are supreme in civil as well as religious
matters : in a word, they are kings as well as gods.
Thus the divinity which hedges a king has its roots
deep down in human history, and long ages pass before these are sapped by a profounder view of nature and
of man.
In the classical period of Greek and Latin antiquity
the reign of kings was for the most part a thing of the
past ; yet the stories of their lineage, titles, and preten
sions suffice to prove that they too claimed to rule by
divine right and to exercise superhuman powers. Hence
we may without undue temerity assume that the King
of the Wood at Nemi, though shorn in later times of
his glory and fallen on evil days, represented a long line of sacred kings who had once received not only the
homage but the adoration of their subjects in return
for the manifold blessings which they were supposed to
dispense. What little we know of the functions of
Diana in the Arician grove seems to prove that she was
here conceived as a goddess of fertility, and particularly as a divinity of childbirth. It is reasonable therefore to



ix IN RELATION TO THE OAK 281
suppose that in the discharge of these important duties
she was assisted by her priest, the two figuring as King
and Queen of the Wood in a solemn marriage which
was intended to make the earth gay with the blossoms
of spring and the fruits of autumn, and to gladden the
hearts of men and women with healthful offspring.
If the priest of Nemi posed not merely as a king, but as a god of the grove, we have still to ask, What
deity in particular did he personate ? The answer of
antiquity is that he represented Virbius, the consort or
lover of Diana. But this does not help us much, for of
Virbius we know little more than the name. A clue to
the mystery is perhaps supplied by the vestal fire which
burned in the grove. For the perpetual holy fires of
the Aryans appear to have been commonly kindled and
fed with oak wood,1 and we have seen that in Rome
itself, not many miles from Nemi, the fuel of the vestal
fire consisted of oaken sticks or logs, which in early
days the holy virgins probably gathered or cut in the coppices of oak that once covered the Seven Hills. But
the ritual of the various Latin towns appears to have
been marked by great uniformity ; hence it is reasonable
to conclude that wherever in Latium a vestal fire was
maintained, it was fed, as at Rome, with wood of the
sacred oak. If this was so at Nemi, it becomes probable
that the hallowed grove there consisted of an oak wood,
and that therefore the tree which the King of the Wood
1 See The Golden Bough* Hi. 347-349, where, however, the statement as to the universal use of oak wood in kindling the need-fire is too absolute, exceptions having since come to my knowledge. These will be noticed in the third edition of The
Golden Bough.



282 HUMAN JUPITERS LECT.
had to guard at the peril of his life was itself an oak.
Now the oak was the sacred tree of Jupiter, the supreme
god of the Latins. Hence it follows that the King of
the Wood, whose life was bound up in a fashion with
an oak, personated no less a deity than Jupiter himself.
At least the evidence, slight as it is, seems to point to
this conclusion. The old Alban dynasty of the Silvii or
Woods, with their crown of oak leaves, appears to have
aped the style and emulated the powers of Latian
Jupiter, who dwelt on the top of the Alban Mount. It
is not impossible that, as Mr. A. B. Cook has suggested,
the King of the Wood, who guarded the sacred oak a
little lower down the mountain, was the lawful successor
and representative of this ancient line of the Silvii or
Woods. 1 At all events, if I am right in supposing that
he passed for a human Jupiter, it would appear that
Virbius, with whom legend identified him, was nothing
but a local form of Jupiter, considered perhaps in his
original aspect as a god of the greenwood. The conclusion that the priestly kings of Nemi were
regarded as a series of human Jupiters, who represented
the great god on earth, and came, one after the other, to
a violent end in that capacity, is singularly confirmed
by a passage of Plautus. In the Casino, of that
dramatist an old man promises to protect a slave against
the anger of the rest of his family. " I'll be your
Jupiter/' says he, " and so long as I am propitious, you need not care a straw for these lesser gods." " That's
1 A. B. Cook, "Zeus, Jupiter, and the Oak," Classical Review, xviii. (1904), pp. 363 5f.



ix HUMAN JUPITERS 283
all nonsense,*
1 retorts the slave, " as if you did not know
how human Jupiters die a sudden death. When you
are a dead Jupiter and your kingdom has passed to
others, who will there be to protect me ? " 1 Here the
slave alludes, as a matter of common notoriety, to
certain human Jupiters who died sudden deaths and
whose kingdom passed to others. Now, who were
these mortal Jupiters? If they were the priests of
Nemi personating the great god, the allusion would be
understood by every one, and would be particularly apt
in the mouth of a slave, himself a member of the class
from which these human Jupiters were drawn. If the
allusion was not to them, it remains, as far as I know,
inexplicable. I need hardly point out how exactly a dynasty of mortal Jupiters would fit on to an older
dynasty of mortal Saturns, if at Nemi, as elsewhere
perhaps in Latium, the earliest kings personated the god of the seed and were put to death in that character at
the Saturnalia or festival of sowing long before their
successors lived and died as gods of the oak.
The hypothesis that in later times at all events the
King of the Wood played the part of the oak god
Jupiter is confirmed by an examination of his divine
partner Diana. For two distinct lines of argument
converge to show that if Diana was a queen of the
woods in general, she was at Nemi a goddess of the oak
in particular. In the first place, she bore the title of
Vesta, and as such presided over a perpetual fire, which

calling my attention to this important passage.



284 DIANA AND THE OAK LECT.
we have seen reason to believe was fed with oak wood. 1
In the second place, the nymph Egeria at Nemi appears
to have been merely a form of Diana, and Egeria is
definitely said to have been a Dryad, a nymph of the
oak." Elsewhere in Italy the goddess Diana had her
home on oak-clad mountains. Thus Mount Algidus,
a spur of the Alban hills, was covered in antiquity with
dark forests of oak, both of the evergreen and the
deciduous sort. In winter the snow lay long on these
cold hills, and their gloomy oak woods were believed to
be a favourite haunt of Diana, as they have been of
brigands in modern times. 3 Again, Mount Tifata, the
long abrupt ridge of the Apennines which looks down on the Campanian plain behind Capua, was wooded of
old with evergreen oaks, among which Diana had a
temple.4 On the whole, then, we conclude that at
Nemi the King of the Wood personated the oak god
Jupiter and mated with the oak goddess Diana in the
sacred grove. An echo of their mystic union has come
down to us in the legend of the loves of Numa and
Egeria, who, according to some, had their try sting-place in these holy woods. 5

ix JUPITER AND JANUS 285
the divine consort of Jupiter was not Diana but Juno,
and that if Diana had a mate at all he might be expected
to bear the name not of Jupiter but of Dianus or Janus,
the latter of these forms being merely a corruption of
the former. All this is true, but the objection may be
parried by observing that the two pairs of deities, Jupiter and Juno on the one side, and Dianus and Diana, or
Janus and Jana, on the other side, are merely duplicates
of each other, their names and their functions being in
substance and origin identical. With regard to their
names, all four of them come from the same Aryan
root D/, meaning bright, which occurs in the names of
the corresponding Greek deities, Zeus and his old
female consort Dione. 1 In regard to their functions,
Juno and Diana were both goddesses of fecundity and childbirth, and both were sooner or later identified with
the moon. 2 As to the true nature and functions of
Janus, the ancients themselves were puzzled ;

decide. But the view mentioned by Varro l that Janus
was the god of the sky is supported not only by the
etymological identity of his name with that of the sky god Jupiter, but also by the relation in which he
appears to have stood to Jupiter's two mates, Juno and
Juturna. For the epithet Junonian bestowed on Janus 2
points to a marriage union between the two deities ; and
according to one account Janus was the husband of the
water nymph Juturna, 3 who according to others was
beloved by Jupiter.
4 Moreover, Janus, like Jove, was
regularly invoked, and commonly spoken of, under the title of Father. 5 Indeed, he was identified with Jupiter,
not merely by the logic of a Christian doctor, the great
Augustine himself,6 but by a pagan worshipper who
dedicated an offering to Jupiter Dianus. 7 A trace of
his relation to the oak may be found in the oak woods
of the Janiculum, the hill on the right bank of the
Tiber, where Janus is said to have reigned as a king in
the remotest ages of Italian history.

ix DUPLICATION OF DEITIES 287
was variously known among the Greek and Italian
peoples as Zeus and Dione, Jupiter and Juno, or Dianus
(Janus) and Diana (Jana), the names of the deities
being identical in substance, though varying in form
with the dialect of the particular tribe which worshipped
them. At first, when the peoples dwelt near each
other, the difference between the deities would be hardly
more than one of name ; in other words, it would be
almost purely dialectical. But the gradual dispersion
of the tribes, and their consequent isolation from each
other, would favour the growth of divergent modes of
conceiving and worshipping the gods whom they had carried with them from their old home, so that in time
discrepancies of myth and ritual would tend to spring up and thereby to convert a nominal into a real dis
tinction between the divinities. Accordingly when,
with the slow progress of culture, the long period of
barbarism and separation was passing away, and the
rising political power of a single strong community had begun to draw or hammer its weaker neighbours into a
nation, the confluent peoples would throw their gods,
like their dialects, into a common stock ; and thus it
might come about that the same ancient deities, which
their forefathers had worshipped together before the
dispersion, would now be so disguised by the accumu
lated effect of dialectical and religious divergencies that
their original identity might fail to be recognised, and
they would take their places side by side as independent
divinities in the national pantheon. 1
1 Mr. A. B. Cook, who accept* my theory of the original identity of Jupiter and



288 JANUS AND JANUA LECT.
This duplication of deities, the result of the final
fusion of kindred tribes who had long lived apart, would
account for the appearance of Janus beside Jove, and of
Diana or Jana beside Juno in the Roman religion. At
least this appears to be a more probable theory than the
opinion, which has found favour with some modern
scholars, that Janus was originally nothing but the god
of doors. 1 That a deity of his dignity and importance, whom the Romans revered as a god of gods and the
father of his people, should have started in life as a
humble, though doubtless respectable, doorkeeper,
appears to me, I confess, very unlikely. So lofty an
end hardly consorts with so lowly a beginning. It is
more probable that the door {janua) got its name from
Janus than that he got his from it. This view is
strengthened by a consideration of the word janua
itself. The regular word for door is the same in all
the languages of the Aryan family from India to
Ireland. It is dur in Sanscrit, thura in Greek, thtir in
German, door in English, dorus in old Irish, and /0m in
Latin. 2 Yet besides this ordinary name for door, which
the Latins shared with all their Aryan brethren, they had
also the term janua, which has nothing corresponding
Janus, Juno and Diana, has suggested that Janus and Diana were the deities of the
aborigines of Rome, Jupiter and Juno the deities of their conquerors. See his article, "Zeus, Jupiter, and the Oak," Classical Review, xviii. (1904), pp. 367 sq.
1 This is the opinion of Dr. W. H. Roscher (Lexikon d. griech. undrdm. Myt/iologie,
ii. 47), Mr. W. Warde Fowler (Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic, pp. 282 sqq. ), and Prof. G. Wissowa (Religion und Kultus der RSmer, p. 96). It is rejected for the reasons given in the text by Ph. Buttmann (Mythologus, ii. pp. 72, 79) and S. Linde
(De Jano summo Romanorum deo, pp. 50 sqq.\ 2 G. Curtius, Grundzuge der griechischen Etymologic? p. 258 ; O. Schrader, Reallexikon der Indogcrmanischen Altertumskunde (Strasburg, 1901), p. 866.



ix JANUS AND JANUA 289
to it in any Indo-European speech. The word has the
appearance of being an adjectival form derived from the noun Janus. I conjecture that it may have been
customary to set up an image or symbol of Janus at the principal door of the house in order to place the
entrance under the protection of the great god. A
door thus guarded might be known as a janua foris^
that is, zjanuan door, and the phrase might in time be
abridged mtojanua y the noun forts or door being understood but not expressed. From this to the use ofjanua
to designate a door in general, whether guarded by an image of Janus or not, would be an easy and natural
transition. 1 If there is any truth in this conjecture, it
may explain very simply the origin of the double head of Janus, which has so long taxed the ingenuity of
mythologists. When it had become customary to guard the entrance of houses and towns by an image of
Janus, it might well be deemed necessary to make the
sentinel god look both ways, before and behind, at the
same time, in order that nothing should escape his
vigilant eye. For if the divine watchman always faced
in one direction only, it is easy to imagine what mischief
might have been wrought with impunity behind his back.
To apply these conclusions to the priest of Nemi, we
may suppose that as the mate of Diana he represented
originally Dianus or Janus rather than Jupiter, but that
1 This explanation of the derivation of janua from Janus was suggested, but not
accepted by Ph. Buttmann (Mythlogut, it. 79 tqq.). It occurred to me independently. Mr. A. B. Cook alto derives janua from Janui, but he would explain the derivation
by supposing that the lintel and two side-posts of a door represented a triple Janus.
See his article "Zeus, Jupiter, and the Oak/' Clattical Review, xviii. (1904), p. 369.
U



2 9o DIANUS AND DIANA LECT.
the difference between these deities was of old merely
superficial, going little deeper than the names, and leaving practically unaffected the essential functions of
the god as a power of the sky, the thunder, and the
oak. If my analysis of this great divinity is correct,
the original element in his composite and apparently incongruous nature was the oak. Time does not permit
me to set forth the reasons for this conclusion : you will
find them stated in the new edition of my book. In
any case it was natural that the human representative of
the oak god at Nemi should dwell, as we have seen
reason to believe he did, in an oak grove. His title of
King of the Wood clearly indicates the sylvan character
of the deity whom he served ; and since he could only
be assailed by him who had plucked the bough of a
certain holy tree, his own life might be said to be bound
up with that of the tree. Thus he not only served but
embodied the great Aryan god of the oak ; and as an
oak god he would mate with the oak goddess, whether
she went by the name of Egeria or Diana. Their
union, however consummated, would be deemed essential
to the fertility of the earth and the fecundity of man
and beast. Further, as the oak god had grown into a
god of the sky, the thunder, and the rain, so his human
representative would be required, like many other divine kings, to cause the clouds to gather, the thunder to
peal, and the rain to descend in due season, that the
fields might bear fruit and the pastures be covered with
luxuriant herbage. It was appropriate therefore that
the worship of a god who dealt so much in water should



ix NEMI AND ROME 291
be established on the shore of a lake, and that his divine
consort Egeria should be in one of her aspects the
nymph of a spring.
The reputed possessor of powers so exalted must
have been a very important personage ; and the evidence
I adduced in the first lecture suffices to prove that the
sanctuary at Nemi was one of the greatest and most
popular in Italy. It was fitting that the ancient Aryan
worship of the god of the oak and the dripping sky
should here linger so long in its early, almost Druidical,
form among the green woods and beside the still waters
of the Alban hills, until a great political and intellectual
revolution shifted the seat of Latin religion from the
forest to the city, from Nemi to Rome.
I have nearly done with the priest of Nemi. Yet
it may occur to you that I have left at least one
important question unanswered. If the priest embodied
a god, why expose his precious life to the risk of a mortal combat which so often proved fatal to him ?
why extinguish the divine light instead of husbanding
it to its close ? To ask this is to raise the question
why it has been customary in many parts of the world
to put divine kings and other human gods to a violent
death. I cannot discuss that question fully in the few
minutes that remain, but I will give my answer to it
very briefly. People feared that if they allowed the
man-god to die of sickness or old age, his divine spirit
might share the weakness of its bodily tabernacle, or
perhaps perish altogether, thereby entailing the most



292 DIVINE KINGS SLAIN LECT.
serious dangers on the whole body of his worshippers
who looked to him as their stay and support. Whereas,
by putting him to death while he was yet in full vigour
of body and mind, they hoped to catch his sacred
spirit uncorrupted by decay and to transfer it in that state to his successor. Hence it has been customary
in some countries, first, to require that kings should be
of unblemished body and unimpaired mind, and second,
to kill them as soon as they begin to break up through
age and infirmity. A more stringent application of
these principles led in other places to a practice of allowing the divine king or human god to live and
reign only for a fixed period, after which he was
inexorably put to death. The time of grace granted to limited monarchs of this sort has varied from
several years to one year or even less. The late Miss
Mary Kingsley called my attention to a province of
the Congo region in West Africa where the king's life
and reign are limited to a single day. She was person
ally acquainted with the chief who, a few years ago, possessed but declined to exercise the fatal right of
succession. 1 On the analogy of such customs I con
jecture that the King of the Wood at Nemi formerly
reigned for a fixed period only, probably for a year, and that he had to slay himself or be slain at a great
festival when his term of office was up. This con
jecture is confirmed by the recently discovered account
of the Saturnalia of the Roman soldiers of which I
have already spoken; for that account makes it
1 R. E. Dennett, Notes on the Folklore of the Fjort (London, 1898), p. xxxii.



ix THE KING OF CALICUT 293
probable that the King of the Saturnalia, as he was
called, personated Saturn, and that in early times he
was obliged, after a brief and licentious reign, to cut
his own throat on the altar at the god's great festival.
If that was so, a practice of the same sort may well
have existed at Nemi. Whether the king perished in
the character of Saturn or of Jupiter was a matter of
detail rather than of principle : perhaps, as I have con
jectured, a dynasty of mortal Jupiters may have been
preceded by a dynasty of mortal Saturns.
Further, I conjecture that the old rule of putting the
King of the Wood to death at the end of a fixed period
may afterwards have been mitigated into a custom of
letting him live and reign so long as he could defend
himself against all comers in single combat ; for if he
could do so, it might be taken as a sufficient proof that
he was still fit to discharge his important duties, and that
the dreaded decay of his divine powers had not yet set
in. This conjecture may be supported by the analogy of the kingdom of Calicut, on the Malabar coast of
Southern India, where such a change of practice is
actually recorded to have taken place. In former days
the king of Calicut had to cut his throat in public at
the end of a reign of twelve years.
1 But towards the
close of the seventeenth century the stern old rule had
been modified as follows. At the end of the twelve
years a great festival was celebrated with mirth and
jollity, and any man who pleased was free to attack the

294 THE GREAT SACRIFICE LECT.
king, and, if he killed him, to reign in his stead. The
permission, however, was little more than an empty
form, since the king took good care on these occa
sions to surround himself with his guards. Still there
were always found men brave and reckless enough
to throw away their lives in a vain attempt to fight
their way through the soldiery and win for themselves
a crown at the point of the sword. The custom was
observed down to 1743. Exact records of the festivals
and of the number of men who perished at them are
still preserved in the archives of the royal family.
They were examined by Mr. W. Logan, with the
personal assistance of the reigning king, about twenty years ago. As these festivals furnish the closest modern
parallel to the practice of Nemi, I propose to conclude
my lectures with a description of them. 1
The festival at which the king of Calicut staked his
crown and his life on the issue of battle was known as
the Maha Makham or Great Sacrifice. It fell every
twelfth year, when the planet Jupiter was in retrograde motion in the sign of the Crab, and it lasted twenty
eight days, culminating at the time of the eighth lunar asterism in the month of Makaram. As the date of
the festival was determined by the position of Jupiter
in the sky, and the interval between two festivals was
1 Sec W. Logan, Malabar (Madras, 1887), i. 162-169. The writer describes in
particular the festival of 1683, when fifty-five men perished in the manner
described. A brief account of the following festival, that of 1695, was published by Alexander Hamilton, an English traveller who passed along the coast at that time and heard the sound of the guns for two or three days in the distance. See
Alex. Hamilton, "A New Account of the East Indies," in Pinkerton's foyages and
Travels, viii. 374.



ix THE KING'S ST4R 295
twelve years, which is roughly Jupiter's period of revolution round the sun, 1 we may conjecture that the
splendid planet, which with the still brighter star of
Venus has lately been illuminating the western firmament
every evening, was supposed to be in a special sense
the king's star and to determine his destiny, the period
of its revolution in heaven corresponding to the period
of his reign on earth. However that may be, the
ceremony was observed with great pomp at the
Tirunavayi temple, on the north bank of the Ponnani
river. The spot is close to the present railway line.
As the train rushes by, you can just catch a glimpse
of the temple, almost hidden behind a clump of trees
on the river bank. From the western gateway of the
temple a perfectly straight road, hardly raised above
the surrounding rice- fields and shaded by a fine
avenue, runs for half a mile to a high ridge with a
precipitous bank, on which the outlines of three or
four terraces can still be traced. On the topmost of
these terraces the king took his stand on the eventful
day. The view which it commands is a fine one.
Across the level expanse of the rice-fields, with the
broad placid river winding through them, the eye
ranges eastward to high flat-topped tablelands, their
lower slopes embowered in woods, while afar off looms
the great chain of the Western Ghauts, and in the
furthest distance the Neilgherries or Blue Mountains,
hardly distinguishable from the azure of the sky above.
1 The sidereal revolution of Jupiter it completed in n years 314.92 day* ia Britamicaf t.v. * Aitronomy," ii. 808).



296 THE ATTACK ON THE KING LECT.
But it was not to the distant prospect that the king's
eyes naturally turned at the fateful hour. His atten
tion was arrested by a spectacle nearer at hand. For
all the plain below was alive with troops, their banners
waving gaily in the sun, the white tents of their many
camps standing sharply out against the green and gold
of the rice-fields. Forty thousand fighting men or more
were gathered there to defend the king. But if the
plain swarmed with soldiers, the road that cuts across
it from the temple to the king's stand was clear of
them. Not a soul was stirring on it. Each side of
the road was barred by palisades, and from the palisades
on either hand a long hedge of spears, held by strong
arms, projected into the empty road, their blades
meeting in the middle and forming a glittering arch of steel. All was now ready. The king waved his sword.
At the same moment a great chain of massy gold,
enriched with bosses, was placed on an elephant at his
side. That was the signal. On the instant a stir
might be seen half a mile away at the gate of the
temple. A group of swordsmen, decked with flowers and smeared with ashes, has stepped out from the
crowd. They have just partaken of their last meal on
earth, and they now receive the last blessings and fare
wells of their friends. A moment more and they are
coming down the Jane of spears, hewing and stabbing
right and left at the spearmen, winding and turning and writhing among the blades as if they had no bones
in their bodies. It is all in vain. One after the other
they fall, some nearer the king, some further off,



ix THE SHADOW OF A CROWN 297
content to die, not for the shadow of a crown, but for
the mere sake of approving their dauntless valour and
swordsmanship to the world. On the ten last days of
the festival the same magnificent display of gallantry,
the same useless sacrifice of life, was repeated again and
again. Yet perhaps no sacrifice is wholly useless which
proves that there are men who prefer honour to life.
That is an Indian parallel to the priest of Nemi.
