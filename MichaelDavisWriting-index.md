Foreword
All peoples have a fundamental right to the protection of their heritage. This right includes Indigenous peoples. Our heritage is central to our capacity to maintain our culture and identity. It flows from our status as first peoples. Laws and policies in Australia have had mixed results in recognising and protecting our Indigenous heritage. Generally, they have dealt with the visible manifestations and expressions of culture rather than the whole body of our heritage, including both the visible, and the intangible cultural knowledge. Indigenous heritage must be recognised and protected in both its tangible and intangible aspects. In order to develop effective approaches for the recognition and protection of Indigenous heritage, we need to understand its history in the consciousness of Europeans. This book helps us to do this. It reviews some of the ways in which non-Indigenous Australians, and some early visitors to this country, described our heritage. By drawing on writings by a variety of observers, travellers, collectors, administrators, ethnologists and other Europeans since the middle of the nineteenth century, it charts the range of perceptions held by these people. Whether these writers were commenting on stone tools, bark paintings or ceremonial performances, most did not see these things or activities as being interconnected, as parts of a whole, living cultural system. It was only by about the 1950s that some began to realise this vital point – that the tangible aspects of culture were intimately connected to sacred sites and the spiritual elements of Indigenous culture. What is also all too apparent, as the history presented in this book shows, is that many Europeans – particularly administrators and politicians – were not cognisant of the fact that



viii Writing Heritage
Indigenous peoples themselves should have control over decisionmaking with regard to their Indigenous heritage. Writing Heritage presents the views of non-Indigenous people who wrote about Indigenous heritage in their own words. This allows us to examine in a historical context the kind of language used by non-Indigenous people to denote aspects of this heritage. An understanding of this perspective will, I am sure, provide an important reference point for those who are concerned today with policy formulation, legislation, and the protection and management of Indigenous heritage.

Prologue
There is growing interest in the ways in which museum collections have been formed, in the people who made these collections, and in the journeys the objects have taken in assuming their present status as museum collections. The formation of collections of Indigenous cultural objects has been of particular interest, partly as a result of the major transformations taking place in the role of museums, and in their new approaches to the collection, display and interpretation of Indigenous cultures. The National Museum of Australia holds many important ethnographic collections, acquired over the decades by a diverse range of individuals who together helped shape and influence the history of anthropology and Indigenous studies in Australia. These collections comprise an important component of the nation’s heritage; they also remain a vital part of the cultural heritage of Indigenous Australians. It is because of the Museum’s role in communicating and in being a custodian of Indigenous heritage that we are pleased to be associated with the publication of this timely book, Writing Heritage.
Writing Heritage explores in narrative form, using the words of the individuals themselves, how non-Indigenous Australians and occasional visitors to Australia portrayed the various facets of Indigenous heritage that they encountered, observed, recorded or collected. The many themes in Writing Heritage include a critique of the notion of authenticity – the idea that there was an authentic, or genuine, Aboriginal culture and heritage. The book also explores



x Writing Heritage
ways of collecting, and the various priorities that individual collectors and their correspondents gave to the form, function, use and meaning of Aboriginal cultural objects. Importantly, Writing Heritage presents a fresh perspective on the making of Indigenous heritage, and one that will contribute to an understanding of the role of individuals, museums, heritage institutions and others in the interpretation and representation of that heritage.

Introduction xiii
Introduction
Bones, stone artifacts, and wooden implements will remain in our museums for ever, but the habits, laws, beliefs and legends are doomed to rapid extinction.1
The ethnologist and administrator Herbert Basedow wrote this in his 1925 book The Australian Aboriginal. Basedow’s gloomy opinion epitomised much white Australian thinking about Aboriginal culture for many decades. His remark also highlights an important theme of this book. That is, that what is today called ‘Indigenous heritage’ was often thought of by outsiders – by people who are not Indigenous and therefore cannot be said to have an insider’s view as comprising essentially the physical aspects of Indigenous culture, the ‘bones, stone artifacts, and wooden implements’ of Basedow’s list. To Indigenous people, however, their heritage is also the ‘habits, laws, beliefs and legends’, and much more besides. It is this fragmentation of Indigenous cultural heritage that underpins much of the way in which non-Indigenous Australians perceived it. European-Australians tend to regard Indigenous heritage in terms of its particular elements, rather than as a whole body of culture. Observers, travellers, ethnologists, administrators and collectors were often fascinated, puzzled, concerned and even repelled by aspects of Indigenous culture. Most often, they focused on what was visible, especially material culture such as stone and wooden tools and implements, bark and rock paintings, but also public displays of ceremony. Often, especially in later decades, ‘Indigenous heritage’ was defined in contexts of adversity or conflict, or through contests over land, sites or objects. Eroded rock carvings caught the



xiv Writing Heritage
attention of observers, who called for their preservation. Or significant sites entered the public imagination as contested domains, as arenas for competing claims. Even today, legislation and policy, and the administration and management of Indigenous heritage, commonly break this heritage up into discrete elements. I have long been interested in the concept of heritage, although I did not necessarily articulate it as heritage until my adult working life. I tended to see it more in terms of some kind of unknown, nostalgic past. I recall that during my childhood years in England I had a strong sense of wonder at a past that seemed to be so powerfully imbued in the landscape of rural Kent, where I lived. I still retain fond memories of wandering through London’s museums, enthralled at the seemingly endless displays of objects before me. I also recall my delight at finding fossils, coins, and even a small bronze Greco-Roman statue in the soil, chalk valleys and woodlands that surrounded our village. This euphoria of discovery was almost matched by a vague reflection on the mystery of these objects. Where had they come from? Who had made them? Why were they there? These objects, with all their associated memories, nostalgia and entangled histories now lie scattered around my house in Canberra, mute witnesses to some romantic notion of an imagined past. My interest in heritage was later developed through my work in Australia in policy formulation for the recognition and protection of Indigenous heritage. That work stimulated my interest in exploring how non-Indigenous Australians have written about Indigenous heritage over time. In surveying these writings, from the past one hundred years and more, I have pondered the ways in which people responded to, described or engaged with that concept we now call ‘Indigenous heritage’. Although the term ‘Indigenous heritage’ is commonly used in laws, policy documents and planning and administrative contexts, in practice it and its underlying concept remain subject to considerable



Introduction xv
debate and speculation over meaning, validity and viability. For those European-Australians who described the material products of Indigenous societies and ceremonies, songs and dances, the term was rarely if ever used. Rather, they described the various aspects of the culture that they saw, recorded and collected in terms of separate entities; to them this was not ‘heritage’, but ‘stone tools’, ‘implements’, ‘bark paintings’ and so on. If collective terms were used, these were ‘relics’, ‘curios’ or ‘monuments’ – terms that implied a distanced curiosity about matters that were thought to belong to the world of science and empire, rather than to living Indigenous cultures. Throughout this narrative I have used the terms ‘EuropeanAustralian’ or ‘European’ to denote ‘non-Indigenous’ people. Although ‘Aboriginal’ and ‘Indigenous’ are used interchangeably, and implicitly include Torres Strait Islanders as well as Australian Aboriginal peoples, the diversity of Aboriginal peoples and cultures is acknowledged, as is the distinctiveness of Torres Strait Islanders. My broad argument is that the concept of an Indigenous heritage was fragmented by those who observed, collected or variously managed it in order to render it amenable to European-Australian law, policy and administration. My aim in this book is not to discuss Indigenous cultural heritage as such, nor to describe a history of heritage protection; rather, it is to describe textual representations of this heritage. That is, the ways in which Indigenous heritage was written about, and the kind of language used to describe, define and classify it. One of the themes apparent throughout the writings examined is the notion held by Europeans of an ‘authenticity’ in Indigenous heritage. Other themes include the influence of ideas about primitivism, and the engagement between European-Australians and Indigenous heritage as manifested through the development of markets, museums and exhibitions, and fieldwork practices involving photography, film and recording.



xvi Writing Heritage
For much of the time many writers maintained an idealised model of pristine ‘traditional’ Indigenous societies. They held the view that one could find a ‘true’ or ‘authentic’ Aboriginal culture that was ‘untouched’ by European influence. Many thought that this ‘authentic’ Indigenous culture and heritage was only to be found in remote regions, away from the ‘corrupting’ influences of European civilisation. Therefore, these remote regions – ‘the outback’ – were the areas most subject to the intense gaze of the European eye. The Northern Territory in particular was a region most associated in many Europeans’ minds with remoteness, as a place where the ‘real’ Australian Aboriginal was to be located. In sampling writings by European-Australians I have selected works that illustrate a range of perceptions about Indigenous cultural heritage, and that have been made by a variety of actors, in terms of their professions, disciplines, gender, and perceived status as ‘professional’ or ‘amateur’. The narrative of Writing Heritage is informed by my view that there is no homogeneous, essentialised ‘European-Australian’ viewpoint, but rather, a diversity of opinions, perceptions and representations of Indigenous heritage. I have also sought to illustrate different European representations in what I call ‘private discourses’ and ‘public discourses’. The former category includes diaries, journals and personal correspondence; the latter consists largely of published works. In addition, I have examined some ‘official discourses’ – those writings that comprise policy documents, official correspondence and reports, and legal materials. The term ‘heritage’, like ‘culture’, is complex and multilayered. It is concerned with memory, reflection and the transmission of culture. It encompasses the way that communities maintain their culture and identity through time by means of oral performance, reenactment and other forms of expression. Referring to this community identity, the term also denotes a body of laws, beliefs, practices or values transmitted through generations. In this sense, heritage is often thought of as ‘tradition’ or ‘custom’, in some



Introduction xvii
discussions connoting a body of fixed, unchanging rituals maintained and performed in some agreed or prescribed form. Heritage has close associations with notions of ‘the past’, of antiquity and origins. The past is a very powerful concept, as various writers remind us.2 It has attributes of nostalgia, and of a desire for things gone or that are old. American historian David Lowenthal writes that ‘formerly confined in time and place, nostalgia today engulfs the whole past’.3 Another aspect of the past is the concept of ‘antiquity’, which in Lowenthal’s scheme involves qualities such as ‘remoteness’, ‘the primordial’ and ‘the primitive’.4 These discourses of primordialism and primitivism are also important in European constructions of Aboriginality (or Aboriginalism) that posit an imagined construct of a universal, essentialised ‘Aboriginal’.5 This essentialised ‘Aboriginal’ is often perceived as having an affinity with nature, an origin in some imagined, timeless tradition, and as being somebody who habitually re-enacts age-old customs in prescribed ways. A notion of a presumed ‘authentic Aboriginality’ informs many of the writings surveyed in this book. In other contexts, heritage is also something that can be ‘owned’; it is a kind of property. Thus it is referred to variously as ‘shared’, ‘global’ or ‘world’ heritage, ‘national heritage’, or as heritage that ‘belongs’ to particular peoples, ethnic groups or communities. It is within this context that heritage is sometimes defined by competing claims, in a contest between different groups or individuals. This contested domain of heritage becomes more complex when other factors enter into it, such as different kinds of ‘ownership’ claims, which might include moral or legal dimensions. Other ways of associating with heritage, such as custodianship or stewardship, add further layers of complexity. The notion of a global or national heritage suggests not ‘ownership’, in the sense of an individual property right, but some kind of shared or collaborative stewardship. The term ‘heritage’, say Davison and McConville, ‘is an old word, drawn from the vocabulary of those old societies in which



xviii Writing Heritage
primary values derived from ancestral relationships’. These authors observe that ‘in its original sense, heritage was the property which parents handed on to their children, although the word could be used to refer to an intellectual or spiritual legacy as well’.6 Davison and McConville suggest that, as national heritage emerged with the formation of nation states, it came to refer to ‘that body of folkways and political ideas on which new regimes founded their sense of pride and legitimacy’.7 Originally having references to a pioneering past, the term ‘heritage’ has only more recently acquired a meaning associated with notions of preservation. Since about the 1970s, it has acquired a specialised usage ‘as the name we give to those valuable features of our environment which we seek to conserve from the ravages of development and decay’.8 In this sense, heritage ‘has come to refer to things both more tangible, and more fragile, than the imperishable ideals of our ancestors’ and is typically used in a context of preservation and protection.9 Heritage can be said to be ‘the things we want to keep’.10 This sense of the vulnerability and fragility of heritage persists as a preservationist discourse, which recurs throughout the history of European writings explored in this book. The concept of Indigenous cultural heritage was not used specifically in European writings until recent decades. The notion that Indigenous peoples have special interests (such as ownership, custodianship and stewardship) is an even more recent development (and indeed is still not accepted by some). Throughout the long history of European writing about Aborigines, various terms have been used – such as ‘relics’, ‘antiquities’, ‘curiosities’ and ‘monuments’. Terms including ‘heritage’, ‘culture’, ‘art’ and ‘artifacts’ are used in today’s language of policy and administration, but are often employed so widely that they lose precision in meaning. These terms may also become problematic when applied unquestioningly to both Indigenous and European contexts. For example, the term ‘art’ is debated in terms of its use in reference to Indigenous designs and cultural



Introduction xix
products and expressions. The subjectivity of a term such as ‘art’ can be illustrated, for example, by Sutton and Anderson who argue against the notion that ‘art is a concept alien to Aboriginal culture’, claiming that ‘one person’s art may be another person’s junk or kitsch.’ They elaborate:
Speakers of Aboriginal languages are in this sense very similar. Each of the various languages has a term that essentially means sign, design, pattern, or meaningful mark. It is used to describe paintings and other designed things made by people, but it may also describe the patterns of honeycombs, spiders’ webs, the wave-marked sand of the beach, variegated butterfly wings, and a host of other manifestations of similar formal properties. These usually include a combination of repetition, variation, symmetry, and asymmetry; and, like the designs of human artifacts, they are seen as ultimately derived from the Dreaming, the power-filled ground of existence.11
While there may be differences of opinion as to the relative meanings of the term ‘art’ in Indigenous and non-Indigenous societies, there are nonetheless some common themes. Sutton and Anderson argue that ‘what is shared ... is a common conception of intentionally meaningful forms, or signs’. They elaborate:
None of these signs, in the Aboriginal cultures of the precolonial past, were part of an art market in a commercial sense, but they were currency in a competitive political economy. Rights in them could be traded, bequeathed, and, at times, even stolen for their high value. Human artifacts were also subject to similar transactions.12
These authors conclude:
As long as we restrict our sense of the English term art to that elementary level at which it connotes visible and intentional signs made by intelligent beings, we are not stretching a point when we say that Aboriginal paintings, carvings, and other works are art, not ‘by metamorphosis’ and not merely because they now are in the



xx Writing Heritage
global art market, but because they share with similar artifacts the act of representation and a particular potential for meaning.13
The narrative in this book follows the ways in which Europeans constructed their notions of Indigenous heritage, from the early nineteenth century up to the present day. I present this narrative by using many of the actual words of the writers themselves, in an attempt to convey the flavour of the writers’ own voices, perspectives and language. The history of these writings highlights the fact that in many Europeans’ consciousness, Indigenous people were absent as intentional actors who were engaging with their own heritage. If Indigenous people were present at all in these texts, they were often represented as passive objects of Europeans’ gaze or amusement, or as bystanders in an ongoing process of collecting, recording and commenting. In later decades, some writings appeared to show Indigenous people as being engaged in the collecting and recording process, but in this they were at best marginalised and at worst, denigrated. By presenting a discourse of Indigenous heritage in terms such as ‘curiosities’, ‘relics’, ‘antiquities’ or ‘monuments’, as was the case for a considerable part of the period discussed, writers were in effect masking or denying Indigenous heritage as a living force. These terms were more than merely convenient semantic labels. They denoted a prevailing perception of Indigenous heritage as a remnant of a bygone era, or as museum-like traces of extinct or near-extinct people whose primitiveness was anathema to the writers’ various modernising projects. These labels also provided a charter for the imposition of dominant colonising, appropriating or legislating regimes and practices upon Indigenous culture and heritage. The writings presented here were for much of the period reviewed underpinned by powerful themes, such as the idea of progress and of a presumed authenticity. They were also informed



Introduction xxi
by the diverse, idiosyncratic personal agendas of professional rivalry and disciplinary authority. The book briefly explores, too, the shift in Europeans’ perceptions of Indigenous objects as ethnographic items to works of art, and the emergence of markets for items such as bark paintings and other cultural objects. The work is set within the wider contexts of the growth of anthropology in Australia and the developing interest in remote locations, especially in the Northern Territory.






Part I






‘To Rescue from Oblivion’ 3
1
‘To Rescue from Oblivion’
The latter part of the nineteenth century saw a growth in Europeans’ interest in collecting, compiling and documenting Indigenous cultural heritage. This was motivated by several factors, not least of which was the Europeans’ intense curiosity and fascination at the diversity of, and variation among, the objects they saw and acquired. For these early decades, observers, collectors and compilers regarded the objects they found and observed as curiosities, or as antiquities that in some way epitomised the decline of the Aborigines who produced them. Europeans were, during this period, also beginning to express some concerns about the need to preserve these objects, and some collected and recorded Aboriginal culture with this in mind. But this concern with preservation was not because they necessarily understood or appreciated the value or importance of heritage for the Aborigines. Rather, it was driven by a regard for the role that this heritage might have for European science, or in the formation of ‘national monuments’. Many collectors were also zealously intent on building up their own personal collections, or in stocking the cabinets of ethnology museums and universities. In many of the writings of these people we can read a rich narrative of possession, discovery, and the excitement of acquiring treasures and trophies. This was another form of conquest. In this chapter I chart



4 Writing Heritage
the early years of European depictions of Indigenous heritage, as writers sought to come to terms with the immense variety of forms of this heritage, and began to ponder the implications of aspects of material culture such as innovation and tradition, design, decoration, and function.
Wonder and curiosity: brief encounters
European Australians have been fascinated with Aboriginal cultures since they first arrived. The Northern Territory – especially Arnhem Land – seemed to attract the interest of visitors, who saw it as the place where a presumed ‘authentic’ Aboriginal culture could be found. This region was also popular because of the visibility of Aboriginal material and expressive culture there. Many Europeans made brief visits to the continent during exploratory voyages from passing vessels, short survey visits, or as stopovers en route to some other destination. Often, in the course of these sojourns, a visitor would encounter Aboriginal people or traces of their presence, either by chance or intention. In their narratives of their expeditions, visitors often wrote of their encounters with Aborigines using expressions of wonder and curiosity. Among early visitors to northern Australia were James Charles Cox, Captain F. Carrington, and P. W. Bassett-Smith. Cox was a medical practitioner and lecturer in Sydney, and he had a great interest in natural history and ethnology. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of New South Wales, a trustee of the Sydney Museum, and the president of the Linnean Society of New South Wales (formed in 1874).1 In 1879 he presented some bark paintings he had collected from Port Essington, on the northern tip of Australia, to a meeting of the Linnean Society of New South Wales.2 Describing these paintings he commented that, ‘owing to the perishable nature of the bark and to the pigment used, commonly



‘To Rescue from Oblivion’ 5
pipeclay, being easily defaced, few of these illustrations have been saved’.3 Cox’s bemoaning the perishability of the paintings suggests a preoccupation with a notion of permanence in regard to material objects. A desire for permanence underpinned Europeans’ interests in preservation, and was expressed through their production of records of Aboriginal cultural expressions in written accounts, photography, film, sound recordings and drawings. By collecting cultural objects, Europeans could also ensure permanence by removing these objects from their contexts as elements of living cultural systems. This emphasis on permanence contrasted with an alternative view of cultural objects in many Indigenous societies, where they were seen to have transient or ephemeral states (as in sand and body images), or to exist as temporary or semi-permanent entities (as in objects designed solely for use in ceremony). The presentation of Aboriginal cultural objects to the learned societies also highlights a notion of heritage as a public entity in European eyes. European interest in the collection and display of Indigenous cultural objects, and the production of written and visual records of Indigenous cultures for mass circulation and consumption, was likely to have been at odds with the ways in which Indigenous peoples might approach their culture. To Indigenous people, the use, display and circulation of performances and objects was regulated in accordance with well-defined cultural codes. There are also many aspects of objects and performances that are secret – the use, participation or observation of which are restricted to certain prescribed groups or individuals. Europeans’ collecting, display and recording of Indigenous culture was a manifestation of their desire to produce trophies of conquest, to demonstrate their perceived notion of the superiority of European culture and civilisation by parading the products of what they saw as inferior societies.



6 Writing Heritage
These lofty themes were not articulated in the narratives of early explorers and travellers; their writings exhibited a more benign sense of the curious. Cox, impressed by the use of bark, wrote in his account of his Arnhem Land visit:
I have on several occasions seen in caves, drawings of various objects made by the natives, with outlines of lizards and kangaroo, &c, these latter invariably on a small scale, and all associated with the well-known ‘red-hand’ – but I have never met with, until now, such large drawings of animals on sheets of bark, as those I now place before the Society. I have indeed seen even larger sheets of the same material, but these were ornamented by the natives with angular figures painted with red, white, and yellow clay, and a colouring matter, which is obtained from the inside of lumps of ironstone, similar to that used in former times by the aborigines to cover their bodies with. I fancy the only use made of such drawings as these must be to render their meetings more attractive when dancing before the fire in the wild gesticulations of a corrobboree, or they may be drawn for amusement when confined to their caves by the inclemency of weather, certainly not made to ornament their gunya’s as we, our rooms, with pictures.4
Cox’s speculations on these bark paintings were limited to the possible uses of their aesthetic qualities as decoration or for amusement or ornament. His narrative reveals nothing of the possibility of a spiritual dimension to the designs and images on the bark; the emphasis is exclusively on the physical, and the practical. The sense of curiosity about Aboriginal culture evident in Cox’s account occurred in many writings of this era. In November 1886 Captain F. Carrington read a paper to the South Australian Branch of the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia in which he described aspects of Aboriginal culture seen during a journey through the region of the Macarthur River and other rivers of the Northern Territory. In examining the Sir Edward Pellew group of islands, Carrington’s party found, in a cave in a sandstone hill,



‘To Rescue from Oblivion’ 7
‘a couple of very curious weapons’ which he thought ‘appear to be a boomerang and a battleaxe combined’. Carrington emphasised the unusual, commenting, ‘I have not met with weapons like them anywhere else in the Territory, and several friends who have seen them, and who are well acquainted with the natives of Australia generally, have informed me that they have not met with the same kind of weapon elsewhere’. Later, near the western mouth of the Macarthur River, Carrington met with some Aboriginal people. Observing their bark canoe, he was ‘much struck with its beauty as a shapely seaboat’, adding that ‘the science of the shipwrights have not yet produced a vessel of finer lines and proportions than this frail 12-ft. canoe’.5 As was often the case, the description is made in terms of familiar European images and techniques. Exploring the region in the vicinity of the South Alligator River, Carrington noted that ‘the native drawings on bark, that were shown at a late meeting of this society, were obtained in this district’. He described a ground sculpture he had seen in this area:
In walking across the plains, a part of which had lately been burnt clear of grass, we came upon what may be called a very curious drawing. At first sight it looked like a gigantic cartwheel; but after careful measurements were taken, and a sketch of it made in my pocket-book, it was manifest it was an excellent representation of a spider’s web. It measured fourteen yards in diameter, and its production involved an immense amount of labour. The plains are at this part subject to inundation, and it appeared that after the water had subsided, and the ground still damp, the artist, or artists, for I can scarcely think it was done by one man, had taken a flat stone and patted the ground, and thus made it smooth, and leaving the various radial lines and their concentric circles as plainly visible as if it had been done with a pavior’s dolly. Outside this large circle were depicted, in outline, a man in the act of throwing a spear, and two or three animals that were possibly intended for kangaroos in the act of feeding. The sketch taken has, unfortunately, been lost. I had been very careful with the measurements with a view to



8 Writing Heritage
reproduce it drawn to scale; but I can now only remember the diameter.6
In this description Carrington focuses on the process by which this ground sculpture was made and he is impressed by the ‘immense amount of labour’ that contributed to the production of this cultural image. His methodical description suggests an engineer’s or draughtsman’s eye for craftsmanship and detail, as in his comment about having taken careful measurements for a scale drawing. His comment that he could ‘now only remember the diameter’ evokes regret, loss and nostalgia. All he has left to convey his wonder and fascination at the craftsmanship of what he saw is his recollection of a single dimension – the diameter – which reduces the body of the ground design to a simple, one-dimensional element framed in the language of European geometry. Like Cox, Carrington attached importance to the permanent, the enduring and the visible. Had he been able to present the sketch he had made to the learned gathering, Carrington would presumably have provided the physical evidence that seemed so vital to Europeans’ encounters with, and writings about, Indigenous societies and cultures. This sketch, carefully executed by the surveyor’s steady hand, in which the living culture of the Aboriginal ground drawing had been neatly set out in linear detail by measurements, was now sadly lost. It was to have stood as testimony, as witness to the observer’s encounter with the otherwise strange and inexplicable ground drawing. Another visitor to northern Australia was Royal Navy surgeon P. W. Bassett-Smith who wrote of his observations of Aborigines in an article in 1894 in the Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland:
For rather over three months after joining H.M.S. Penguin, a surveying ship employed on the Australian Station in 1891, it was my good fortune to see many of the aboriginal natives of that



‘To Rescue from Oblivion’ 9
country, who, in the north-west part, are and have been less in contact with civilized or western man than in any other portion.7
This illustrates a view held by many writers and observers that Aboriginal people in the northern parts of Australia were in a more ‘natural’ state. Like Carrington, Bassett-Smith paid particular attention to the Aborigines’ weapons:
Their weapons consisted of very long wooden spears, about 12 feet long, ornamented with red and yellow ochre, and white bands, being strongly barbed either on one side, both sides, or three [?] pronged and barbed, or else having a quartzite head fixed on by gums and fibre; short spears either partially of bamboo or wholly of hard wood; these were not barbed, but occasionally pointed with bone; these latter are mostly used for kangaroo hunting. ... Besides their weapons, the only articles they make seem to be coarse baskets and creels for carrying shell-fish, fruit, &c; they apparently felt the want of nothing (except tobacco, an artificial craving), and have no money or trading instincts.8
The impression this text conveys is that although these Aborigines possessed a strong weapons tradition, their society was otherwise self-sufficient, without the need for much in the way of material culture. As with much writing of this period, this text promotes a discourse of lack; as well as lacking in many aspects of material culture, the Aborigines were also thought to lack need. Bassett-Smith paints a picture of a closed society, of a people without unnecessary wants and needs, thus they ‘have no money or trading instincts’. This hints at the European ideal of the ‘noble savage’, who was thought to have lived in harmony with the environment and maintain a sustainable society within existing resources. As did many Europeans in their narratives of encounter with Aborigines, Bassett-Smith remarked on what he described as the Aborigines’ ‘artificial craving’ for tobacco. Tobacco was an



10 Writing Heritage
important trading item, and became a common currency used in the process of acquiring bark paintings and other cultural products. Bassett-Smith’s comments on the ‘specimens’ he obtained of the Aboriginal peoples’ drawings are particularly revealing of his attitude to their abilities in representation:
During my stay there, I gave paper and chalks to them, and obtained a number of specimen drawings, for the representation of natural objects is much practised among the Australians, and is one of the lowest intellectual developments; some of the figures are particularly grotesque, but the meaning was generally evident.9
Here, Bassett-Smith’s assumption that Aborigines possessed merely an ability to represent natural objects places them in a hierarchicalevolutionary scheme in which more creative abilities are found in more ‘highly developed’ societies. This view contrasts with those of other writers, especially in later years, who saw Aboriginal creativity as an important aspect of their adaptive and innovative strategies. It is also interesting to note Bassett-Smith’s use of paper and chalks to obtain ‘specimen drawings’ – a practice that was used by Charles Mountford, among others, later in the next century.
On making collections: natural history and ethnology
A theme that was common to many visitors’ accounts was that of collecting. To Europeans, Aboriginal culture presented untold possibilities for the formation of ethnological collections for museums and research institutions, and for filling the homes of individuals and corporations. For some writers, the collection and recording of Aboriginal cultural objects was synonymous with the collection and documentation of natural history. Often too, collecting Aboriginal cultural objects was part of a process of documenting the culture along with ‘collecting’ customs and manners. Norwegian zoologist Carl Lumholtz, for example,



‘To Rescue from Oblivion’ 11
explained that the purpose of his expedition to Queensland in the 1880s was to make ‘collections for the zoological and zootomical museums of the University, and of instituting researches into the customs and anthropology of the little-known native tribes which inhabit that continent’. 1 0 Lumholtz’s project epitomises the tendency common among many writers at this time to regard Aboriginal people as part of Australia’s flora and fauna.
From compilers to collectors
Curiosity and a zeal for collecting were important motivations for the many people who compiled generalised accounts of Aboriginal culture from throughout the continent. Indeed, to some, recording and collecting Aboriginal culture seemed almost an obligation. These compilers and collectors often relied for their information on existing notes by missionaries, explorers and antiquarians, and on correspondence with a wide range of individuals. Robert Brough Smyth was one such compiler, who published his ‘notes relating to the habits’ of the Aborigines of Victoria in 1878.11 He explained that ‘when, sixteen years ago, I was appointed Secretary of the Board for the Protection of the Aborigines, it seemed to me to be my duty to collect information respecting the customs of the people who had formerly owned the soil of Australia, and to make accurate drawings of their weapons and ornaments’.12 In contrast with Bassett-Smith, Brough Smyth was impressed with Aboriginal peoples’ capacity for ornamentation and their artistic skills, as he observed that:
they roughly carve their weapons with the stone tomahawk and stone chisel, but the ornamentation is effected by a very neat tool, formed of one side of the under-jaw and tooth of the opossum. This, when fixed to a wooden handle, is a most useful cutting instrument ... Their shields, their clubs, their throwing-sticks, and their cloaks, are often profusely ornamented.13



12 Writing Heritage
Brough Smyth compared the Aborigines’ skill in producing designs with western artistic creativity, and he extolled their creative abilities, stating that ‘without culture, without refinement, the Australian is an artist’. He expounded on their techniques:
He paints in caves, in places where he has access to caves; and, where there are none, he bends a sheet of bark, smokes the inner surface until it is blackened, and then depicts with the nail of his thumb or a bone-awl, pictures of birds, and beasts, men, and scenes in his life. He decorates the smooth rocks that front the sea, and finds in the representations that have been made by others and in his own efforts the same kind of delight that fills the mind of the civilized mind when he sits before his easel.14
Brough Smyth appears surprised that the Aborigines were able to demonstrate such artistic skills ‘without culture or refinement’, illustrating a tendency for many writers to compartmentalise aspects of Aboriginal culture (i.e., ‘art’, ‘culture’, ‘technology’). Like many writers he is keen to accurately detail and classify Aboriginal ‘customs’:
The customs of the natives of Australia are so like, in many respects, those of other existing savage or barbarous races and those of the people of ancient times, that one feels more and more the necessity of a classification, in which would appear every known custom and the place where it is practised, exactly after the manner that the geologist elaborates his system of the classification of rocks.15
His comparison of the classification and documentation of Indigenous ‘customs’ with geological classification again links ethnology to the natural sciences. As with many writings of this period, his focus is on classification and order, constructing Indigenous cultures and societies within a western framework of measurement and science. In this comparative sense he draws analogies with ancient Europe, noting that ‘the modes of ornamenting the shields, clubs, and other weapons of the Aboriginal natives of Victoria are similar



‘To Rescue from Oblivion’ 13
to those of the people who fabricated the urns of baked or burnt clay found in tumuli in England and Scotland’.16 In discussing stone implements, Brough Smyth asserts that those used by ‘uncivilized races are necessarily regarded by archaeologists and geologists with great interest’.17 Here again is the sense of the exotic, wherein Aboriginal cultural items are the subject of the curious gaze of European ‘experts’. This notion that Indigenous heritage was of particular interest and importance to European scientists and other ‘experts’ denied the primary importance of this heritage to the Indigenous peoples themselves. In these last years of the nineteenth century there was much activity by Europeans in describing aspects of Aboriginal heritage, and in circulating these descriptive accounts in journals and proceedings. Many of these descriptions were produced as brief notes, comments or reports, often simply signalling a new ‘find’ or ‘observation’ of some item of Aboriginal culture, such as a stone implement, stone circle or rock image. These accounts filled the pages of the journals of learned societies such as the Linnean Society of New South Wales, the Royal Society of Victoria, and the memoirs and transactions of museums, geological and geographical societies, among others. They were often written in a matter-of-fact, ‘objective’ or ‘scientific’ style, offering little more than a narrative description, devoid of any substantial analysis. They were, however, often imbued, at least implicitly, with a sense of wonder, and some were marked by the occasional intrusion of a personal view or opinion, such as the Rev. John Mathew’s remark concerning graffiti on some Aboriginal rock paintings:
The difficulty of copying has been increased through the ambition of white people to secure a cheap fame by scribbling over the aboriginal work with charcoal. One feels indignant that so rare a relic of aboriginal art should be wantonly desecrated and defaced.18



14 Writing Heritage
This is an early statement of the problems Europeans increasingly noted regarding cave and rock paintings and engravings – their often poor state of preservation, high degrees of erosion or, in this case, damage from graffiti or other activities by Europeans. Although Mathew did not explicitly call for measures for preserving the paintings, his expressed indignation at the damage and comment on the distinctiveness of this art (‘so rare a relic’) implies a view on the need for preservation. His use of the term ‘relic’ suggests an idea of Aboriginal art and heritage as something left behind, a trace or memory of a people no longer existing. The preservation of ‘relics’ was therefore sought not for the purpose of protecting Aboriginal peoples’ rights in their heritage, but for the sake of Europeans’ own interests in science, empire and classification. Art works, stone tools, bark paintings and other items of portable Indigenous heritage were sought as museum objects, as additions to growing collections for display, or as mementos of a former race. Where items of Indigenous heritage were seen ‘in-situ’ – such as rock and cave paintings or engravings, these were similarly regarded as objects for advancing Europeans’ interests in science and natural history, as new ‘discoveries’. Another compiler was Thomas Worsnop, the South Australian Town Clerk who, in 1897, produced a compilation of available descriptions of Aboriginal artifacts and their descriptions. He titled his work The Prehistoric Arts, Manufactures, Works, Weapons, etc., of the Aborigines of Australia. Worsnop wrote in his Preface:
The antiquities of prehistoric man in Europe, Asia, Africa, and America have been fully investigated and carefully described by various learned men. With respect to Australia, however, it has been considered until lately that she has no antiquities, and consequently little attempt has hitherto been made to collate the discoveries that from time to time have been made of the prehistoric arts, manufactures, and remains of her various aboriginal tribes.



‘To Rescue from Oblivion’ 15
I trust therefore that in this effort to rescue from oblivion the primeval antiquities of Australia some interest may be awakened in the public mind in regard to them. This may have the result of inducing others more minutely and systematically to examine and describe the vast store of pictographic records still existing in this continent, embracing so much yet to be deciphered and understood; thus let me hope that these native productions may be permanently recorded and explained.19
Worsnop has created an image of a long-lost domain of ‘primeval antiquities’ awaiting discovery by Europeans; his writing is marked by a powerful sense of the absence of Aborigines. The makers of the ‘antiquities’ have, in Worsnop’s view, long departed, leaving only their traces, the enigmatic remains of their former lives. He sounds a call to others to record and explain this otherwise ‘lost’ heritage, in what might be seen as an early promotion of the idea of preservation of heritage. By ‘rescuing from oblivion’ these lost antiquities, and ‘awakening’ an interest ‘in the public mind’ about them, Worsnop creates a sense of wonder. His writing is also notable for its affirmation of the ‘artistry’ of the Aborigines:
In collecting these pictorial and other monuments of Australian art and work I had in view the extended information thus made available not only to the archaeologist and the ethnologist, but to the general reader also. I have endeavored to show that Australia is not barren in pictography in order to excite a more general interest in its preservation, and by comparison with the works of other nations to secure for our aborigines a due appreciation of their undoubted artistic nature.20
Worsnop had a high opinion of Aboriginal art, comparing it favourably with that of other countries. He was, according to authors Peter Sutton, Philip Jones and Steven Hemming, ‘the person who first drew attention to the innovative and less wellknown forms of Aboriginal art’. These writers claim that as



16 Writing Heritage
Worsnop was ‘not bound by the taxonomic rigidities of nineteenthcentury ethnography’, he ‘sought to explore the many variations of Aboriginal art across the continent’.2 1 Worsnop emphasised the ‘uniqueness’ of Aboriginal art and culture by placing it within a comparative framework with the artistic works of Indigenous peoples in other countries. He wrote:
I do not hesitate to affirm that many of these artistic productions, which without question are genuine emanations of the Australian aboriginal mind, will bear very favorable comparison with those of prehistoric man in any other part of the world.22
He regarded Aboriginal peoples’ cultural expressions as having an Indigenous origin, but one that may have originated outside of Australia:
The customs of one tribe may be taken as the customs of all, with slight variations or modifications, and these rather encourage the idea that all of them have sprung from one distinct body of emigrants who reached these shores ... .23
This view of the homogeneity of Aboriginal cultures across the continent did not accord with that of other writers such as Spencer, as will be seen.
Among the Aborigines: the Horn Expedition
Brief visits and surveys, and broad compilations, were some of the means by which Europeans acquired information about Aborigines and their cultures. At the same time there were also many research expeditions whose specific purpose was to gather such information. One such expedition, organised by South Australian financier W. A Horn, travelled to Central Australia in 1894. Horn declared the object of this expedition in his narrative:



‘To Rescue from Oblivion’ 17
Travellers’ tales ... of the manners and customs of the natives, and the varieties of plants and animal life in these remote regions, had aroused a widespread interest, and at the solicitation of a few scientific friends I resolved to organise and equip a party, composed of scientific men, to thoroughly explore this belt of country.24
Like Lumholtz, Horn saw the collection of ethnographic information as central to the study of natural history. He elaborated on the tasks proposed for the expedition:
... the scientific examination of the country from Oodnadatta to the McDonnell Range; the collection of specimens illustrative of the fauna, flora, and geological structure and mineralogical resources of that region, and the illustration by photography of any remarkable natural features of the country traversed; the securing of photographs of the aborigines in their primitive state, the collection of information as to their manners, customs, and language, and the reproduction of their mural paintings.25
‘These rare and interesting stones’
Among the aspects of Aboriginal culture that interested the members of the Horn Expedition were those sacred objects known as tjurunga. Baldwin Spencer introduced readers to these objects (referred to in his narrative as ‘churiña’) in the context of their use in ceremonies. He declared that ‘intimately associated with these [sacred ceremonies] are the sacred stones and sticks which have been referred to in the Anthropological section by Mr. Gillen and Dr. Stirling’.26 Spencer later recognised the significance of tjurunga in Aboriginal society, and the consequences of inappropriately revealing these objects to the wrong persons. Another expedition member, E. C. Stirling, highlighted the lack of knowledge that Europeans had of the tjurunga, as well as the apparently secret nature of these objects among the Aborigines. He wrote that ‘concerning them a good deal of secrecy and mystery exists amongst



18 Writing Heritage
the blacks, and very little has been said, or seems to have been known, of their true significance’.27 The Aborigines kept their knowledge relating to tjurungas closely guarded, and this heightened the sense of mystery these objects conveyed to Europeans. It also strengthened the latter’s desire to obtain ‘specimens’ of tjurungas. Stirling declared that he had ‘been for some time familiar with the objects in question, from the fact that during recent years the South Australian Museum has received a good many examples from various parts of Central Australia’. He understood prior to the expedition that ‘special value was attached to them [the tjurungas], that they were made objects of mystery and concealment, and that they had some kind of connection with important sites and ceremonies’. ‘These facts’ he wrote, ‘made me very anxious to gain further information concerning them’.28 It was not only information about tjurungas that the members of the Horn Expedition were keen to acquire; the objects themselves were also collected, as is well documented in the expedition reports.29 In fact it could be said that these expeditioners – or some of them at least – saw the collection of tjurungas as a goal of their journey. They sought to hunt these prized objects as trophies, as treasures that would enhance their cabinets of curiosities. Expedition surveyor Charles Winnecke had ‘cajoled an Aboriginal guide, Racehorse, into revealing the location of a tjurunga storehouse near Haast Bluff’, and the sacred objects were taken by the expedition members.30 Winnecke’s Journal entry for Friday, 22 June, records that accompanied by ‘the black boy Racehorse’ and Dr Stirling, he went ‘in search of two corrobboree stones said to have been hidden here by the natives’. Winnecke claims that he was ‘not aware of the doctor’s object in wishing to visit this spot’ before setting out. He had accompanied Stirling, he claimed, because ‘I desired to sketch in the northern portions of the range and connect my present traverse with my previous work of 1878’. Although the ‘directions for finding them [the ‘corrobboree stones’] were most explicit’ and, the



‘To Rescue from Oblivion’ 19
writer asserts, ‘we followed them out to the letter’, they did not locate them, and ‘returned to the camp without the longed for curiosities’. Winnecke sought information from Racehorse ‘and, after a vast amount of evasion, elicited the information that a large number of corrobboree stones were hidden in a cave in the ranges to the eastward’. The author, satisfied with this information reported that:
I obtained knowledge of the exact position of this cave, and as these rare and interesting stones are of especial interest and value to the ethnological department I have determined to visit this spot tomorrow.31
The following day Winnecke resumed his search, despite the resistance of his guide, Racehorse. Having finally located the cave in which the tjurungas were deposited, Winnecke describes the almost mechanical precision with which the intruders removed the sacred items:
The entrance to the cavern was partly filled up with loose fragments of rocks and the interior with gum and wattle boughs. On removing [them?] an enormous number of wooden corrobboree sticks, varying in size and shape, were first exposed. Some appeared to be very ancient, and exhibited signs of frequent use. ... Many expeditions have started in search of this cave, but hitherto all have failed to find it, as nothing would induce the local natives to betray its whereabouts. We first removed sixty wooden tablets (or so-called sticks), all being elaborately carved or marked on both sides with a number of concentric lines, which appeared to be perfectly intelligible to both our black boys. Underneath these we obtained fifteen stone tablets, carved in like manner. This latter discovery is the most important yet made of these rare specimens of native skill, and will materially enhance the value of the ethnological collection. Selecting some thirty-three wooden, opossum, emu, euro, sugar ant, and other corrobboree sticks, and taking all the stone ones, I left a number of tomahawks, large knives, and other things in their place,



20 Writing Heritage
sufficient commercially to make the transaction an equitable exchange. ... After carefully packing our trophies on the camels we started at sundown, intending to return to the main camp if possible to-night.32
Winnecke’s narrative is laden with the language of possession and discovery, referring to the tjurungas as ‘treasures’ and ‘trophies’. In his account, the desire to expand the ethnological collection took precedence over any regard for the interests that Aboriginal people were likely to have had regarding their cultural objects. Although this was certainly not the first instance in which Europeans had taken these sacred objects, according to Philip Jones ‘it was Edward Stirling’s “Anthropology” chapter in the Report of the Horn Expedition, published in 1896, which first brought tjurunga to the attention of scholars, collectors, and the public’.33 John Mulvaney comments on this instance of ‘collecting’ tjurungas:
Sacred objects had been taken by Europeans previously, more as curios and probably not in such number. This episode involving a major storehouse and the subsequent publicity served as a challenge. Europeans collected specimens like geological fossils, the size of a collection and the intrigue and bluff which went into the hunt added spice. Their monetary value only became a factor much later.34
The tjurungas continued to mystify and fascinate Europeans. Descriptions of these objects abounded in the combined works by Spencer and Gillen.
Custom and variation
Ideas about Australian Aboriginal cultural heritage were formed by prevailing views about the nature of Indigenous societies and cultures more generally. Writers’ interests in the extent and nature of innovation in – and the diversity of – Indigenous heritage



‘To Rescue from Oblivion’ 21
became, in their views, the defining features of Aboriginal cultures and societies. The works of Spencer and Gillen dominated the first two decades of the twentieth century, and these workers articulated particular views about innovation and variation. In The Native Tribes, they posited a society that was conservative and bound by custom:
As amongst all savage tribes the Australian native is bound hand and foot by custom. What his fathers did before him that he must do. If during the performance of a ceremony his ancestors painted a white line across the forehead, that line he must paint. ... Any infringement of custom, within certain limitations, is visited with sure and often severe punishment.35
In the context of this ‘rigid conservatism of the native’, Spencer and Gillen pondered how it was possible that the changes they noted occurring in Aboriginal societies ‘can possibly even be mooted’.36 Many writers were similarly fascinated by the apparent inherent capacity of Aborigines to adapt and innovate, especially in a context of rapid change as was occurring with increasing European encroachment. Spencer and Gillen also had some comments to make on the question of variation among Aboriginal peoples:
In many works of anthropology it is not unusual to see a particular custom which is practised in one or more tribes quoted in general terms as the custom of ‘the Australian native’. It is, however, essential to bear in mind that, whilst undoubtedly there is a certain amount in common as regards social organisation and customs amongst the Australian tribes, yet, on the other hand, there is great diversity.37
This view of diversity contrasted with that of some other writers, such as Worsnop, who thought Aboriginal culture to be homogeneous throughout the country.



22 Writing Heritage
Decorative and creative aspects
The notion that the Aborigines possessed a creative life intrigued observers and commentators as they pondered the extent to which this was ‘art’ in the western sense and debated the relative aesthetic and decorative qualities of these artistic works. Spencer and Gillen were among those who contemplated decorative aspects of Aboriginal cultural life. They declared that the Central Australian Aboriginal peoples’ ‘weapons and implements are of a very simple nature’, and contained relatively few decorative features.38 Writing within an evolutionary idiom, these authors placed Aborigines relatively low on the scale of humankind in regard to the quality of their decorative art – below that of the peoples of Papua New Guinea. Nonetheless, they thought that ‘the designs and decorations concerned with his ceremonies are of a very definite and often elaborate description, revealing considerable appreciation not only of form but also of colour’.39 Commenting further, they wrote:
... no implement or weapon is ever really carved, or has painted upon it anything but the simplest form of design. This is all the more strange because the native is capable of such work as may be seen by an examination of work of this kind which he does in imitation of what he sees the white man doing; but it must be remembered that in their natural condition the members of the Central tribes do not make anything in the way of carved ornamentation. This should be borne in mind as various objects, such as sticks with knobs, carved so as to resemble natural objects, are occasionally manufactured by members of some of the very tribes with which we are here dealing, who have been in contact with white men, and are even finding their way into museum collections.40
Many writers agreed with the assumption in this extract that Aboriginal peoples’ innovations were the result of these peoples’ encounters with, or knowledge of, Europeans. To some writers,



‘To Rescue from Oblivion’ 23
Aboriginal peoples’ imitative skills were a corollary of the Aborigines’ lowly place on the scale of humankind. To others, Aborigines’ capacity to imitate was a more positive attribute related to creativity, adaptation and innovation. Although Spencer and Gillen saw Central Australian Aboriginal culture as generally lacking in complex decorative and innovative features, any such elaboration that did occur was explained as the result of European influence:
Cut off from contact with outside peoples there has been no stimulus leading to the development of decorative art beyond a certain point, and most probably their most elaborate decorations are the much modified representatives of designs which once had a very definite meaning.41
As with many writers, Spencer and Gillen astutely recorded the replacement of traditional implements with introduced iron and steel, observing that ‘since the advent of the white man the iron axe and knife are rapidly supplanting the stone weapon’.42 This theme of replacement, common in writings throughout the following century, was expressed in a variety of ways, including nostalgia over the ‘loss’ of stone implements, or denigration at what was considered the tainted influence of Europeans. This preoccupation with European influence was also central to discussions about rock art.
Early writings on rock art: George Grey and the Wandjina
Of all the elements of Indigenous heritage that drew the attention of Europeans, among the more popular were stone tools, and rock and cave markings. Fascination with these latter – called variously rock or cave ‘art’, ‘engravings’, ‘paintings’, ‘drawings’, or ‘markings’ resulted in a considerable amount of activity concerned with description, debate and discussion, which continues to form an



24 Writing Heritage
important element to archaeological and anthropological studies and writings. In the view of one archaeologist, Andrée Rosenfelt, ‘rock art, or art on natural surfaces, is arguably the most enduring of Aboriginal artistic productions’. Rosenfelt argues that rock art ‘is the only source of evidence for Aboriginal art predating the collection of Aboriginal objects by European observers [and] it is evidence for a long tradition that shows strong continuities in its essential forms and structure throughout the entire continent’.43 For the purposes of this discussion, I will be referring to designs and images on ‘cave’ walls and on ‘rock walls’ as aspects of a similar practice. One of the earliest recorded descriptions of ‘cave art’ was by George Grey, who, in his 1841 publication, described what he had seen on his expeditions through Western Australia in 1837–39. In late March 1838, encountering ‘numerous remains of native fires and encampments’, Grey describes the moment of seeing these figures:
... at last, on looking over some bushes, at the sandstone rocks which were above us, I suddenly saw from one of them a most extraordinary large figure peering down upon me. Upon examination, this proved to be a drawing at the entrance to a cave, which, on entering, I found to contain, besides, many remarkable paintings.44
Conveying a sense of awe, Grey described the drawing of the ‘principal figure’ in graphic terms:
... in order to produce the greater effect, the rock about it was painted black, and the figure itself coloured with the most vivid red and white. It thus appeared to stand out from the rock; and I was certainly rather surprised at the moment when I first saw this gigantic head and upper part of a body bending over and staring grimly down at me. ... It would be impossible to convey in words an adequate idea of this uncouth and savage figure.45



‘To Rescue from Oblivion’ 25
Grey made some sketches of these figures, and described them in some detail. In another cave nearby he observed a rock carving of a human head and face ‘cut out in a sandstone rock which fronted the cave’. He commented on this:
... this rock was so hard, that to have removed such a large portion of it with no better tool than a knife and hatchet made of stone, such as the Australian natives generally possess, would have been a work of very great labour.46
Summing up his impression of this carving, Grey commented that ‘the whole of the work was good, and far superior to what a savage race could be supposed capable of executing’.47 Like many writers, Grey was also intrigued by the age of these rock images. He suggested that ‘the only proof of antiquity that it bore about it was that all the edges of the cutting were rounded and perfectly smooth, much more so than they could have been from any other cause other than long exposure to atmospheric influences’.48 He then conjectured poetically on the ultimate fate of the Aborigines and their culture:
I sat in the fading light, looking at the beautiful scenery around me, which now for the first time gladdened the eyes of Europeans; and I wondered that so fair a land should only be the abode of savage men; and then I thought of the curious paintings we had this day seen, – of the timid character of the natives, – of their anomalous position in so fertile a country, – and wondered how long these things were to be.49
Grey could not reconcile the utter savagery he saw in the Aborigines with these fine rock images. As he wrote:
... whatever may have been the age of these paintings, it is scarcely probable that they could have been executed by a self-taught savage. Their origin, therefore, must still be open to conjecture.50



26 Writing Heritage
Grey’s curiosity about the origin and authorship of the rock paintings prompted some debate in the literature. In 1925 Herbert Basedow wrote of the images seen by Grey that ‘there is perhaps no other Australian drawing, old or modern, which has been so freely discussed and criticized’. Basedow thought one of the paintings was ‘unquestionably that of a human being, although it measured fully nine feet in length’. This figure, he noted, ‘reminded one forcibly of a Buddha in a Ceylonese temple’.51 Like Grey, Basedow imagined these paintings to have been created or at least influenced by people other than the Aborigines, asserting ‘there is no doubt about these curious drawings, now more or less adopted by the local tribe, having originated under some exotic influence’. Among those who might have influenced or produced these images, he speculated, were Macassans, Papuans or shipwrecked sailors.52 Other writers had attributed the creation of these images variously to Sumatran or Malayan, Moorish, ancient Japanese or Hindu visitors.53 Faced with the challenge of describing and defining, and a felt need to ‘explain’ elements of a culture vastly different to anything they had encountered previously, Europeans often sought analogies with the familiar repertoire of their own or other better-known imagery. The cultures of the ancient world and the east provided them with a lexicon and terminology for building analogies and comparisons with the Aboriginal cultural products and expressions that they encountered. Writing in 1930 anthropologist A. P. Elkin was similarly struck by the distinct character of these paintings, claiming that these rock shelters ‘have been quite famous for many years on account of the peculiar type of paintings found in them, so unlike anything found elsewhere in Australia’.54 Elkin’s account was based on several weeks field research, during which he ‘was able to discuss the pictures with the natives’. Unlike Grey, however, Elkin understood these images to be part of the Aboriginal tradition for this region. Elkin wrote that he eventually hoped to ‘fully understand what they mean to the



‘To Rescue from Oblivion’ 27
people’, and to ‘endeavour to interpret their meaning and function, as far as I was able to ascertain this from the natives who use the galleries’.55 He concluded that he could ‘throw no light on the origin of these paintings’, and explained:
The natives say that they do not make the wondjina [sic] figures, but only repaint them. Further, they say that blackfellows did not originally make them, but that the picture, wondjina, ‘lalan wondiauina’, that is, made itself. If some of the wondjina paintings could be shown to be beyond the powers of the natives, or to depict subjects of which they could have, or could have had, no knowledge, then we could be certain that this type of painting has been introduced in some way or other. The distribution in a narrow strip along the western part of the North Kimberley might suggest that they are a recent invention or introduction, and yet the condition of some of the paintings undoubtedly points to a somewhat high antiquity. They must at least go back for a considerable time before Grey’s visit in 1839.56
Omitting the hands and feet of the wondjina figures sketched by Grey there is nothing in the workmanship of any of the paintings, which is beyond the skill of the present natives, or indeed, of a child.57
Therefore, as far as workmanship goes, the natives of the district could have originated this form of art.58
The wandjina paintings of the Kimberley have continued to attract the attention of archaeologists, historians, travellers and others.59 In 1965 archaeologist and historian Ian Crawford ‘visited sites first recorded by Sir George Grey in 1837’, and described in his 1968 work, The Art of the Wandjina, how he thought the wandjina paintings were an integral part of the complex artistic and mythological heritage of the Aboriginal people of this part of the Kimberley.60



28 Writing Heritage
The ethnocentric views of Grey and others who argued for ‘foreign’ origins of wandjina paintings have been dismissed by Ryan and Akerman, writing in a 1993 exhibition catalogue on Kimberley Aboriginal art that ‘these fanciful explanations betray a total ignorance of the original Kimberley inhabitants and serve to reinforce what was then the supremacy of the invading culture’.61 In the many years since Grey’s narrative, other writers have continued to puzzle over and debate the images that they encountered on rock and cave walls. In 1894 the Rev. John Mathew noted the ‘art of painting’ among the Aborigines:
The art of painting has been so little practised by the aborigines of Australia, that to say they were ignorant of it altogether would not be far from the truth. Some of them after contact with Europeans have given evidence of considerable imitative power, but usually native pictorial art has not risen higher than rude conventional sketches of men, kangaroos, emus, turtles, snakes and weapons, done mostly in charcoal and occasionally cut out on trees or graven on rocks. The linear designs scratched on the inner surface of opossum rugs or carved on weapons, and sometimes coloured red, black or yellow are of the simplest patterns. But at a few places, very widely apart, specimens of art have been discovered immeasurably superior to the ordinary aboriginal level.62
Mathew’s bleak summary of what he considered Aboriginal peoples’ ‘limited creative abilities’ is typical of many whose views of Aboriginal people were fashioned within an evolutionary framework that defined Aborigines as primitive, and low on the scale of human progress. Mathew’s comment that European influence had, in some cases, led to ‘evidence of considerable imitative power’ among Aborigines also foreshadows a discourse about the nature of ‘imitation’ in the context of work such as that of Albert Namatjira some decades later.



‘To Rescue from Oblivion’ 29
Other writers on rock art
Towards the end of the nineteenth century, and in the early years of the new century, other workers were acquiring information on Aboriginal art, heritage and culture through more sustained periods spent in a particular location. One of these was ethnologist Walter Roth, who spent some time among Aboriginal people in north and central Queensland. As well as being an ethnographer, Roth also had a career as an administrator and medical officer. In 1898 he became the ‘first northern Protector of Aborigines’ based at Cooktown, and was Chief Protector at Brisbane from 1904 to 1906.63 Among the elements of Aboriginal heritage that Roth observed were rock markings, which he termed ‘mural painting’. He detailed the images depicted in them:
The only two localities where examples of mural painting have been met with, to my knowledge, in these North-West-Central Districts are on Oorindimindi Station, and at a small waterhole on the old Normanton road, about six miles from Cloncurry. At the latter, these consist of a saurian type of figure, varying from about 12 inches to over 6 feet in length, and hence possibly representing a lizard, an iguana, or crocodile, painted in red ochre upon the blocks of granite I counted seven or eight of these figures in January, 1896. They are nearly all weather-worn, and except under very careful scrutiny the majority of them would pass unnoticed. ... The local aboriginals knew nothing of these paintings or their significance.64
Roth’s fascination is palpable as he lists the ochre creatures and proudly proclaims, ‘I counted seven or eight of these figures’. His description in the first person amounts to a statement of possession, by which the author establishes his claim in the ‘discovery’. He has described the images in some detail, and then stated that they are, in general, very difficult to see – ‘except under very careful scrutiny the majority of them would pass unnoticed’. However, the fact that he has noticed them and carefully scrutinised them implies his prop



30 Writing Heritage
rietary interest. To strengthen his domination over these images, Roth adds that the ‘local aboriginals knew nothing of these paintings or their significance’. This completes the charter that Roth uses to establish his self-proclaimed right as, in a sense, ‘guardian’ of these paintings. In this scheme, it was assumed that the Aborigines did not own or control the paintings since they knew nothing about them. Therefore the ethnologist has proclaimed his own right to them on the basis of his ‘discovery’ of them, and his expertise in detailing the subject of these images. The theme of personal claim or authority over what they see and encounter is one that underpins much European writing about Aborigines. As the first Europeans to witness, or to find, record or collect some ceremonial performance or cultural object, they assert this as a basis for their presumed right to keep, display, describe, publish or record in other ways that image, performance or object.65 Another writer at this time who commented on Aboriginal creative expressions was Robert Henry Mathews, who produced voluminous writings on Aboriginal culture. In December 1899, R. H. Mathews read his paper, ‘Pictorial art among the Australian Aborigines’, to the Victoria Institute.66 He began by declaring:
Most of the drawings of the Australian aborigines are very primitive in execution, and conventional in type, but they are nevertheless of unquestionable value to the student of archaeology.67
Mathews pointed out that he had ‘made accurate copies of a large number of these pictorial representations, which have not hitherto been recorded’, and that he proposed ‘to treat the subject under the following divisions, namely: Rock Paintings – Rock Carvings Marked Trees – Drawings on the Ground – Images – and Carvings on Wooden Implements.’ Here, again, is the proprietorial tone: Matthews proclaims his authority or expertise in these images by noting he was the first to record them. That this was executed in accurate detail reinforces his authorial claims. This division in



‘To Rescue from Oblivion’ 31
Mathews’ paper of Aboriginal cultural products into separate units that were manageable and amenable to description and analysis was the most common way of presenting material in written accounts. Often in these descriptive accounts there was little or no explicit discussion of the relationships between the different components, or of the connections between them, and Aboriginal culture as a whole. Mathews’ remark about the value of the drawings of the Aborigines to ‘the student of archaeology’ implies that Aboriginal heritage generally was seen by him not as the heritage belonging to the Aboriginal people themselves, but rather, as something that was of objective, scientific interest to Europeans. This notion of heritage as being of value to ‘science’, as a discipline apart and distinct from Aboriginal cultural systems, was a theme commonly found in much European writing. Here, the tone of Mathews’ description of the Aborigines’ drawings as ‘primitive’ and ‘conventional’ suggests a sense of limitation, and is in contrast with his assertion of their ‘unquestionable value’ to the scholarly community. Writers continued to muse over the vast array of markings on rocks, cave walls and other surfaces that they saw. These markings commonly prompted speculation on their origins, antiquity and meanings. Another writer interested in rock markings was surveyor W. D. Campbell, who published one of the first surveys of rock markings in the Port Jackson and Broken Bay regions of New South Wales in 1899.68 Campbell’s work was the result of his having spent many years between 1886 and 1893 ‘in his private time’ scouring the ‘area of country between Botany Bay and Middle Harbour’.69 He wrote that the fertile harbours, bays and creeks, ‘wooded hills and rugged mountains’ of Port Jackson and Broken Bay had enabled the Aboriginal populations to ‘become both numerous and powerful, and individually robust and of large stature’.70 This abundant country had also facilitated their creative life, as he elaborated:



32 Writing Heritage
The leisure time and exuberant vitality evidently enabled them to devote special attention to their ceremonies and amusements judging from the numerous rock-carvings and cave-drawings that are to be found in this district.71
Campbell expressed surprise that these people had evidently devoted some considerable time to activities beyond mere subsistence:
When it is considered what a small amount of labour they devoted to their habitations or anything relating to their personal comfort, it must be surprising that such considerable and sustained efforts were made for the cutting of these figures, sometimes sixty feet long, with a grooved outline, in the solid rock.72
Campbell pondered the lost meaning of these rock images:
The meaning of much of what is thus drawn and cut must inevitably be lost in oblivion with the rapid disappearance of the native races, no effort having been made, in the early days of settlement, to put on record the folklore of the blacks.73
This passage is reminiscent of Worsnop’s writing, with its idea of a disappearing culture and call to record it. Campbell advocates recording by means of drawings:
It is, however, within our power to make reliable drawings of these relics of the past, that surely cannot be without interest to the most casual observer, and must be of priceless value to the student of science in years to come, when the natural decay of the rock surfaces, unless artificially preserved, will have obliterated them for ever.74
This is familiar language, with its references to these sites as ‘relics of the past’ and to their value to science. Even in these early years, near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were keen to ensure preservation of the rock markings, and Campbell expressed his



‘To Rescue from Oblivion’ 33
concern at the rapid deterioration, erosion and destruction from the effects of encroaching European settlement:
A considerable proportion of the carvings now illustrated occur within the Kuringai Chase, and include some of the finest figures. It is satisfactory, that in at least that public reserve, there is an opportunity for their being protected from destruction. Special measures will no doubt be required to suit particular cases. The enclosure by iron railings is not always possible, but there are no localities where the durability of the stone might not be greatly increased by applying a transparent solution of silica to the surface in the same way as building stone is treated.75
The reference to the need for ‘special measures’ presages later discussions and debates about proposed new legislative approaches to preserving and protecting Indigenous heritage. Campbell’s mention of the benefits of protecting these sites by their location within a ‘public reserve’ also foreshadows later views regarding the role of Aboriginal reserves in preserving heritage objects and sites. The question of antiquity and origins of the rock markings perplexed Campbell:
In regard to the age of these markings it is plain that the practice of marking the rocks goes back further in time than the rocks can give evidence upon. The rate of decay must be unequal in different strata and different localities, but many hundreds of years must have elapsed since most of these rock-carvings were made, and they range down to quite recent times, as evidenced by the figures of rabbits being carved at Woy Woy. ... There is hardly sufficient evidence collected as yet, however, to be able to form any very clear idea regarding the antiquity of either the carvings or paintings.76
Value judgements about aesthetic quality, and the search for the ‘meaning’ of images and designs produced by Aborigines, were among those aspects of Aboriginal cultural heritage that most preoccupied Europeans. The many remarks by writers that the



34 Writing Heritage
aesthetic quality of Aboriginal ‘art’ was low on the scale of human cultural productions was consistent with the prevailing evolutionist view of the lowly place on the scale of humankind occupied by Aborigines as a people. In the midst of this generally negative view of Aborigines and their cultural products, we do find exceptions where surprise is expressed at the ‘superior’ level of craftsmanship observed. Yet among those writers who occasionally noted more ‘advanced’ instances of workmanship in Aboriginal cultural objects, some believed this to be the result of ‘foreign’ influences. Those who wrote about Aboriginal heritage were from diverse backgrounds, engaged in a variety of projects. Some, such as Worsnop, Mathew and Brough Smyth, may be regarded generally as ‘collectors and compilers’.77 Others wrote narratives or comments based on their brief encounters with, or observations of, Aboriginal people during shipboard voyages. Many writers based their accounts on previous knowledge, earlier travel and missionary narratives, and the gleaning of information through correspondence with a wide range of others. The learned societies and organisations also played important roles in that they fostered interest in Aboriginal culture, and the meetings and journals of those organisations provided valuable forums for the dissemination and accumulation of information. At the same time there were also people who began to spend extensive periods of time among Aboriginal people, and produced more comprehensive accounts as distinct from the travel or discovery narratives of earlier workers. This latter group included Baldwin Spencer and Frank Gillen, Walter Roth and Alfred Howitt – each of whom worked in different regions of Australia.
Classifying objects: Stirling and Kenyon on stone tools
One subject that continued to provide much interest to Europeans was that of stone tools. These durable and often curious objects could, it was thought, provide clues not only to Aboriginal peoples’



‘To Rescue from Oblivion’ 35
lifestyles, but also to the deeper questions about antiquity and racial affinity. Stone tools were, in this sense, cultural or racial markers: they could be classified to correspond with racial typologies, and provide indicators to comparative ethnologies or cultural or geographic affinities. Many workers devised classificatory schemes, and these then provided a reference for further debates and discussions. Later, with the advent of systematic archaeological work based on excavation, the debates on stone technology acquired different levels of complexity as writers and observers grappled with the critical roles of chronology and stratigraphy. One early endeavour at stone tool classification was by Victorians A. S. Kenyon and D. L. Stirling, who presented a paper in 1900 to the Royal Society of Victoria. They wrote of the need for such classification to assist those studying and collecting stone tools:
It is hardly necessary to enlarge on the need for a classification of the stone implements of the Australian Aboriginal. All investigators, as well as collectors, have experienced difficulties through such want.78
Kenyon and Stirling cast a critical eye over those ‘non-collectors’ who, without the attention to detail and special knowledge of the collector, usually acquired the more easily recognisable and visible ‘ground cutting edged implements, generally known as “Blackfellow’s axe or tomahawks”’.79 The authors claimed that ‘the less distinctive implements have not been described, and when occurring in collections, are frequently wrongly labelled’. We shall be seeing more on this theme of accuracy of description and labelling later, when discussing the collection of Stan Mitchell. Elaborating on the types of implements in collections, Kenyon and Stirling wrote:
A further reason for the undue preponderance of axes or tomahawks in collections is that they are found scattered over the whole country, while almost all the other implements are found at the sites of camps only, being chiefly used in domestic operations.80



36 Writing Heritage
Kenyon and Stirling’s concerns about the places where stone implements are found foreshadows another theme that was subject to ongoing debates and discussions – not only in published accounts, but also in the private correspondence of collectors and ethnologists. This theme concerned the relationship between stone implements and the locations where they are found, which had implications for more inclusive approaches to understanding Indigenous heritage. The emerging recognition of the role of place in Aboriginal material culture was also important for those people who collected in a context that they thought devoid of ‘living’ Aboriginal communities, since it was considered that the specific provenance of a stone implement might reveal some clues regarding the uses, meanings, functions and origins of these objects. It should be remembered, too, that these debates occurred before the advent in Australia of archaeological excavations, which introduced a more rigorous understanding of the significance of depth, and with it, the critical factor of chronology and associated implications for antiquity. Writing in 2000, Aboriginal academic Marcia Langton has summed up nineteenth-century collecting as follows:
The enthusiasm displayed by successive colonists in the collection of Aboriginal objects belied the contempt in which they were held; the objects were appropriated for purposes of study only. There was little or no reference to their beauty or to the technical and aesthetic complexity of their manufacture. They were not perceived as ‘art’, or viewed in any way aesthetically until the twentieth century.81
Although Langton’s comment may pertain to many Europeans’ narratives of this period, from my sampling so far it would appear that there is a greater diversity of perceptions of Indigenous heritage than her summary might allow. Where some writers might have had little or no appreciation of the ‘beauty or technical and aesthetic



‘To Rescue from Oblivion’ 37
complexity’ of Indigenous cultural objects, there were others (such as Carrington) who apparently did have such an appreciation. The next chapter follows some of the debates and discussions on stone tools, their classification, uses, functions and meanings as these occurred in writings by collectors and others in the 1920s and 1930s. Europeans’ interests, concerns and anxieties about change, innovation and adaptation are also examined, as these applied to both stone tools and to Aboriginal artistic expressions and products.

‘Nothing to be Discovered’
During the first decades of the twentieth century there was an increase in the rate of accumulation of information about Aborigines. It was not only information about Aboriginal material culture that was collected, however; there was growing interest by Europeans in the recording, documentation and display of many other aspects of Aboriginal culture, such as ceremony, song and dance. This collecting and recording activity was informed by a notion that Aboriginal societies were ‘disappearing’ or ‘dying’ in the face of European intrusion and influence. The idea of Aborigines as a ‘dying race’ stimulated a sense of urgency in Europeans’ collecting activity, which was also seen as a way of preserving the ‘remnants’ of the disappearing Indigenous cultures. Many people heeded the exhortation by Worsnop in 1897 to ‘minutely and systematically examine and describe’ the vast array of Aboriginal cultural material. One of these was Baldwin Spencer, perhaps the leading ethnographer of Aboriginal culture and society during the first part of the century. Spencer’s pioneering ethnographic work in central and northern Australia was also instrumental in the development of the ethnological collection at the museum in Melbourne. Like many other scientists and researchers, Spencer was keen not only on collecting and recording Aboriginal heritage, but



‘Nothing to be Discovered’ 39
also in exhibiting it. He set out his ideas for the Victorian Museum exhibition in his Guide to the Australian Ethnographical Collection in the National Museum of Victoria, the first edition of which was published in 1901:
In consequence of the peculiar interest which attaches to the Australian aborigines a special gallery has been devoted to the exhibition of their weapons, implements, and ceremonial objects. These have been arranged so as to show, as far as possible, series of objects belonging to tribes from the various parts of the continent. For example, the forms of shields used in different tribes are shown in one case, boomerangs in another, sacred and ceremonial objects in another.1
Spencer’s remark concerning the ‘peculiar interest which attaches to the Australian Aborigines’ constructs the Aborigines as objects of curiosity, exoticising them and serving as a marker for difference. This exoticism in Spencer’s text implicitly provided a charter for a special gallery to display objects of Aboriginal material culture, which in turn highlighted the diversity of objects from all parts of the continent. Spencer did not seek to arrange Indigenous cultural objects within the imposed classificatory framework of the Old World, as he claimed that artifacts were ‘of such variety and yet were used contemporaneously, that European concepts of typology and terminology were confounded’.2 Instead of antiquity and racial affinity being the determinants for Indigenous cultural objects, Spencer’s view (influenced by A. S. Kenyon) was that form and function were dictated by the availability of material. His scheme for ordering Aboriginal cultural objects was, in Mulvaney and Calaby’s view, devoid of a sense of time or chronology, and it indicated a ‘failure to appreciate archaeological possibilities’.3 These authors claim that Spencer ‘treated Aboriginal society as ancient and its ceremonies and institutions as survivals from remote savagery’. They assert that ‘as a stone tool collector, however, he envisaged some



40 Writing Heritage
timeless, unitary technology which embraced most Old World types, including recent Neolithic techniques’.4 These authors describe Spencer’s views as ‘negative dogmas’, perceiving them as being antithetical to archaeological interests:
... Spencer’s prestige and the influence of his museum guidebook reinforced those notions which inhibited the development of systematic field archaeology. These included the belief that there were no stadial or chronological phases in stone technology; that because caves were avoided, it was pointless to excavate for stratified deposits, and even rock-shelters seem to have been included in this assumption; that the nature of the raw material was the controlling factor in the form or size of an implement.5
Like many people at the time with an interest in Aboriginal culture, Spencer also had a sense of nostalgia about the effects of encroaching European influence on Aboriginal material technology, regretting the demise of the stone axe in favour of iron and steel tools. He wrote in the Guide:
Most unfortunately the opportunity was not taken in the early days, before the iron tomahawk had replaced the native stone axe, of bringing together a collection illustrative of implements in daily use amongst the Victorian tribes, and now, owing to the practically complete extinction of the tribes, it is of course impossible to secure them. However, despite this the Australian collection is a fairly representative one and is especially rich in regard to various articles connected with magic and in what are usually designated as ‘sacred’ objects, such as are used during initiation ceremonies, and which of all things possessed by the aborigine are the most difficult to procure, while at the same time they are of the deepest interest.6
Spencer’s classification of Aboriginal cultural objects in his description of the museum did not reflect Indigenous peoples’ own ordering of their cultural products. It was instead informed by the typological and classificatory preoccupations of the collectors and



‘Nothing to be Discovered’ 41
displayers of Indigenous cultural objects. The establishment of the ‘special gallery’, and the focus on acquiring objects and displaying them in terms of ‘a series of objects belonging to tribes from the various parts of the continent’, suggests that Europeans had a museum-based approach to Indigenous heritage. In their fascination for collecting, ordering, classification and display, Europeans exhibited a predisposition towards the methodical, scientific arrangement of cultures as specimens. In this scheme, the Aborigines, like their material objects, were ordered in terms of series, patterns, typologies and hierarchies. Spencer’s remarks in the Guide on the substitution of the ‘native stone axe’ with the ‘iron tomahawk’, and on the scarcity of the former objects, illustrates Europeans’ preoccupation with authenticity. This notion presumed that there was an ‘authentic’ Aboriginal culture – defined according to some vaguely articulated ideas about traditional native societies – that was fast disappearing and being substituted with a ‘fabricated’ culture of introduced ideas and materials. The resulting loss of ‘authentic’ or ‘traditional’ objects and cultural expressions was, to many observers, a clear mandate for Europeans to intensify their efforts in ‘rescuing’ Aboriginal culture by collecting and recording it. As Baldwin Spencer had noted with sadness the demise of the stone axe as metal tools were introduced, so too did Frank Gillen, who, during an expedition to Central Australia, observed in his diary of 1901:
... Added to our collection 5 stone tomahawks, 3 stone knives and 1 stoneheaded fighting pick (Kulungu). It is not at all an easy matter to get hold of stone implements even here and in a few years stone tomahawks especially will be very valuable. Old knife blades, pieces of scrap iron, shear blades and even telegraph line wire are being used instead of stone by the natives, who also make use of glass bottles for manufacturing spear heads. They chip the glass beautifully but it is too brittle to be of much service.7



42 Writing Heritage
While this use of introduced materials to replace stone clearly indicates the capacity of Aborigines to adapt to new ways, to some European observers it instead indicated decay and degeneration. In one manifestation of this ‘degeneration’ view, the quest for a perceived ‘authentic’ Aboriginal cultural life and cultural objects was so powerful that there was a deliberate effort made to ‘(re-)invent’ what was thought to be an authentic culture. For example, C. E. Cowle, a mounted police constable who worked with Spencer and Gillen in Central Australia, proudly wrote to Spencer from Illamurta in August 1900 that ‘I also got four or five of their curved adzes but all had iron tips which I am getting replaced with flints’.8 In pursuing the urgent task of ‘rescuing’ Aboriginal cultural heritage by documenting it during these early years, some Europeans were also asking questions about the ‘origins’ or the ‘antiquity’ of the objects and images that they were finding and recording. In a 1901 article in Science of Man, one writer thought that some unknown non-Aboriginal culture had been responsible for much of the heritage that was observed:
Many persons think there is nothing to be discovered in Australia, except what belong to the black tribes, now or lately found there. But to the more experienced there are many evidences that other peoples, quite different to the blacks, have been in Australia, they having left undisputable proofs of their presence and residence there. ... Although much has been written upon these antiquarian objects, we are yet awaiting a satisfactory explanation as to who made them, and why they were made.9
This suggestion that non-Aboriginal visitors were responsible for producing visible heritage echoes the views of Grey (writing in 1841), and other writers who thought rock paintings and other cultural expressions too sophisticated to have been created by Aboriginal people.



‘Nothing to be Discovered’ 43
As well as arguing for the preservation of the relics left by these mysterious visitors, the Science of Man writer also called for the recording, collection and preservation of Aboriginal cultural heritage:
It should be at once recognised that in the west, north, and other places are many of the antiquities of the blacks and also of other peoples who have been in Australia, and it would be well to collect and forward to us, full particulars of all such things, or they may be destroyed and forever lost.10
Once again we meet the idea of permanence as the author encourages the collection of ‘the antiquities of the blacks’ to prevent further loss and destruction. Europeans’ notion of heritage as something that demands permanence, stability and solidity seems at odds with some views espoused today, especially by Indigenous peoples, of heritage as a ‘living tradition’. In this sense, the designs, images and objects that Europeans so coveted for their museums, galleries, universities and private collections are seen not as remnant trophies of a lost people, but rather as elements vital to the ongoing maintenance and performance of cultural traditions. While there continued to be many writers producing brief, predominantly descriptive accounts of Aboriginal culture, these early years of the twentieth century were also notable for the number of more substantial studies – many of which were based on extensive fieldwork. These works included ethnographic accounts of Queensland Aboriginal peoples by Walter Roth, studies of southeast Australian Aboriginal peoples by Alfred Howitt, and further works on the people of central and northern Australia by Spencer and Gillen. These works continued to debate the themes of ‘authenticity’ and the changes in technology with introduced materials. In his 1904 ethnological notes on the Aboriginal peoples of the north Queensland region, Walter Roth made frequent references to



44 Writing Heritage
the use of introduced European materials. Commenting on the working of wood, he wrote:
What with the introduction of scrap-iron and modern tools, and their consequent trade and barter, the working of timber wholly by aboriginal appliances is so rare nowadays that it is no easy matter to collect reliable information concerning the methods formerly, and sometimes still, employed.11
Roth’s comment about the difficulty in collecting ‘reliable information’ illustrates a theme often found in Europeans’ writings about Aborigines, in which the Aboriginal peoples’ capacity for ‘truth’ is questioned. This question about reliability speaks to a larger view that was often expressed by writers working within an evolutionary framework wherein Aboriginal people were thought to possess low standards of morality, especially when compared with the Europeans’ own values. In discussing stone tool technology, Roth accepted the fact that introduced materials were increasingly being used, as he commented that:
As might have been expected, with the advance of European settlement, scrap-iron filed or ground down is rapidly replacing stone for scrapers ... Amongst aboriginals out of reach of European settlement, even sometimes amongst civilised ones, an ordinary pocket-knife or table-knife is employed rather as a scraper than as a cutting instrument.12
Roth’s observation on the Aboriginal peoples’ use of a pocket or table knife as a scraper also suggests innovation, rather than simply replacement. His account, like many of those who spent some time ‘in the field’, conveys a sense of authority; the ethnographer was witness, and is therefore qualified to speak knowledgeably. In the following extract Roth observed Aborigines in the arduous but exacting process of manufacturing stone implements:



‘Nothing to be Discovered’ 45
The Camooweal blacks maintain that pebbles from the neighbouring Nowranie Creek provide the best native-gouge heads, while the stones lying along the bed of the Georgina River here (as compared with those found on the Gregory River, at Lawn Hills, etc.) are too short and too full of flaws to manufacture good knifeblades from. It was at Camooweal that, during the course of one afternoon, four of the old men must have struck off in my presence quite 300 flakes before a passably suitable one for a good knife was obtained. A large majority of the flakes and chips so produced could of course have been utilised for future use as scrapers, etc.13
Roth’s detailed observation of this process of making stone tools represents an important shift away from the generalised, distanced descriptions of ‘weapons and implements’ found in the accounts of many early writers. While the latter compiled their accounts from existing sources such as travellers’ tales and the records of missionaries, officials and explorers, Roth’s narrative, by contrast, has a freshness of first-hand observation. His description suggests that these Aboriginal people had a sharp eye for quality and accuracy in their manufacture of stone implements, as they struck a considerable volume of stone before those suitable for use were obtained. The description of tool making, and speculations as to origins, functions and purpose of stone tools, are themes that recur in many Europeans’ writings. So too is a fascination with typology and classification, already encountered in Spencer’s writings. Stone technology in particular lent itself to this fascination with typologies, as illustrated in Roth’s discourse on ‘stone-celts’:
I am afraid that too much importance has been hitherto attached to the differentiation of stone-celts into axes, adzes, wedges, scrapers, etc.: the savage most certainly does not recognise the fine distinctions embodied on the labels attached to these articles in an ethnological museum. In the absence of actual observation, is any one competent, for instance, to give a definite opinion as to which of such implements the special use of any stone-celt under consider



46 Writing Heritage
ation most particularly conforms to? ... We are ... faced with a series of objects that may, at one time or another, have been put to at least four different uses. The phrase ‘stone-tomahawk’ seems for the most part to have been a popular Australian misnomer, since it implied that these celts – even if their use as axes be taken for granted – were employed mounted, an implication which was certainly not always the case. Aboriginal evidence also points to the conclusion that these celts were not fighting implements, but articles utilised for purposes of domestic use, especially in the way of cutting timber, either in the log or tree, and particularly in the cutting of notches or toe-holes in climbing. Furthermore, to name any of the larger kinds of celt, for want of a better term ‘ceremonialstones’ is, in my opinion, only to beg the question. It also seems to me too much of an assumption to suppose that the definitive uses of such a specialised implement as an axe, adze, chisel, wedge, etc., are, as a matter of course, known to the savage by intuition.14
In this extract Roth articulates some of the anxieties that continued to preoccupy Europeans concerning Aboriginal stone tools. Some writers formed their views from afar, speculating about the form and function, purpose and meaning of stone tools that they found on the ground or removed from their contexts as part of a living culture. In contrast, Roth used his experience in observation to argue against imposing preconceived classifications and labels on Aboriginal implements. He concluded that the shape of an implement did not determine the type of use:
Where celts have been manufactured from water-worn pebbles, and these apparently constitute the majority of examples discoverable ..., it seems to me futile to base any rational classification upon the shape: the savage, other things equal, will certainly not give himself the extra labour of altering the general contour of such a stone beyond that involved in producing a cutting edge.15
Roth’s comment here also indicates his view that Aborigines’ cultural productions were solely utilitarian; these people were not,



‘Nothing to be Discovered’ 47
he thought, given to imparting a sense of aesthetics or decoration to their technology. There continued throughout much of the century a tension in Europeans’ writings, between those who viewed Aboriginal material cultural objects as having solely functional or utilitarian purposes, and others who perceived Aborigines as having aesthetic sensibilities. While Roth was observing cultural activities among Aboriginal peoples in parts of Queensland, the Adelaide-based medical specialist and ethnographer Herbert Basedow was writing about the peoples he encountered in the northern regions of South Australia and areas of central and northern Australia. His remarks on material culture in a 1903 report of an expedition to north-western South Australia are replete with the language of absence:
In the making and use of implements and weapons the tribes encountered during the expedition were particularly primitive, more so, apparently, than in any other part of Australia.16 Boomerangs, waddies, shields, and other important weapons recorded for different tribes are not known, as far as observation went, to any of the tribes that inhabit the north-western ranges.17
Basedow examined ‘native cave drawings and primitive rock scratchings’ and observed that these were made:
by simply scratching an angular fragment of rock upon the surface of a larger outcrop in such a way as to result in the formation of crude designs and imitative reproductions from nature.18
He then used pencil and paper to obtain ‘original drawings’, reminiscent of a similar technique used some years earlier in 1894 by Bassett-Smith:
Upon teaching some members of the Karkurrerra Tribe, in the vicinity of Erlywanyewanye Waterhole, south of the Musgrave Ranges, the use of a pencil, I succeeded in obtaining a few original drawings on paper .... These, during the time that they were



48 Writing Heritage
constructing the designs, would repeatedly ejaculate their respective meanings.19
Basedow, like many, was interested in obtaining the ‘meanings’ of the art works, and his methods for doing so foreshadowed similar methods used by Charles Mountford and others decades later. These early years of the new century were productive ones for the making of detailed ethnographies. The collaboration between Gillen and Spencer continued, with their publication in 1904 of a further ethnographic account of their extensive work among the peoples of Central Australia, in what they stated was a ‘sequel’ to their 1899 work Native Tribes of Central Australia.20 In this new work, The Northern Tribes of Central Australia, they succinctly re-state their conservative view of Aboriginal culture:
Without in any way disturbing the natives, who still, to the north of the Macdonnell Ranges, practise the customs and retain unchanged the beliefs of their fathers, the few widely scattered telegraph officials, by their consistent kindly treatment of the natives, have come to be regarded by the latter as their friends, and this fact served us in good stead.21
Spencer and Gillen, renowned for their interest in producing visual records, ‘were provided with a phonograph, and so were able to secure records of native songs associated with both the ordinary corroborees and sacred ceremonies’.22 They claim authority for their account on the basis of being the first to ‘fill a gap’ and produce a study of these particular peoples:
Up to the present time there has been no reliable and detailed account published of the organisation, customs, and beliefs of the tribes inhabiting the wide extent of country lying between the Macdonnell Ranges in the centre of the continent and the Gulf of Carpentaria. Practically nothing is known of their customs ... The present work is an attempt to fill this gap in our knowledge of the Australian aborigines.23



‘Nothing to be Discovered’ 49
Consistent with their view of Aboriginal culture as inherently conservative, they invoke geographical isolation as an explanation for this lack of change:
Taking every class of evidence into account, it appears to us to be very difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Central tribes, which, for long ages, have been shielded by their geographical isolation from external influences, have retained the most primitive form of customs and beliefs.24
Spencer and Gillen made a particular study of Aboriginal ceremonial life, and their ethnographies provide considerable detail of this aspect of culture. Despite what we have come to regard as these authors’ unusual ability to gain an understanding of the depths of Aboriginal religious and cultural life, their work surprisingly is, in parts, underpinned by a notion of Aborigines as crude savages, as the following passage shows:
A word of warning must, however, be written in regard to this ‘elaborate ritual.’ To a certain extent it is without doubt elaborate, but at the same time it is eminently crude and savage in all essential points. It must be remembered that these ceremonies are performed by naked, howling savages, who have no idea of permanent abodes, no clothing, no knowledge of any implements save those fashioned out of wood, bone, and stone, no idea whatever of the cultivation of crops, or of the laying in of a supply of food to tide over hard times, no word for any number beyond three, and no belief in anything like a supreme being. Apart from the simple but often decorative nature of the design drawn on the bodies of the performers, or on the ground during the performance of ceremonies, the latter are crude in the extreme.25
This is a discourse of what historian Bernard Smith calls ‘hard primitivism’, which had associated with it notions of ‘austerity and fortitude’ and defined Indigenous peoples who ‘in their natural state’ were thought to be ‘depraved and ignoble’.26 In this scheme,



50 Writing Heritage
the Australian Aborigines, in contrast to the ‘soft primitivism’ of the Polynesians, were exemplars of hard primitivism.27 The brutish Aborigines were ‘ignoble savages’, while their more refined Pacific counterparts were ‘noble’.28 Spencer’s depiction, in the quote above, of the Aborigines as lacking in many aspects of their lives, paints them as primitive indeed, yet there is also here a sense of the ‘austerity’ in Smith’s characterisation of ‘hard primitives’. Austerity in itself cannot be assumed to be a negative quality or a pejorative judgement; rather, it may suggest a state of being in which there is an intentional desire to do without many of the trappings of modernity. The description of Aborigines in Spencer’s account (and in those of many other Europeans) as lacking in ‘permanent abodes’, ‘clothing’, and in many kinds of implements, in itself need not necessarily define people in a pejorative or racist way. Indeed, simplicity and restraint can also be a virtue, suggesting an efficient lifestyle, resourceful, without waste or undue abundance, and unencumbered with material goods beyond those necessary for sustaining a community. Multiple readings and interpretations are possible for all the texts surveyed in this book. Spencer and Gillen had much to say on the performance of ceremonies, and their description again is couched in terms of simplicity and crudeness:
It is difficult, if not impossible to write an account of the ceremonies of these tribes without conveying the impression that they have reached a higher stage of culture than is actually the case; but in order to form a just idea the reader must always bear in mind that, though the ceremonies are very numerous, each one is in reality simple and often crude. It is only their number which causes them to appear highly developed.29
Spencer and Gillen’s ethnography is arranged into chapters with headings such as ‘weapons and implements’ and ‘decorative arts’, following what was a fairly typical format for ethnographic accounts



‘Nothing to be Discovered’ 51
of the time. In their account of stone tools, the imminent demise of stone technology in favour of introduced materials such as steel is once again a subject of interest:
At the present day the making of stone implements threatens to become rapidly a thing of the past, over practically the greater part of the Central area. Even amongst tribes which have had very little intercourse with white men, iron is beginning to replace stone, and it will be only a matter of comparatively few years before, at all events, stone hatchets will cease to be made and used. Iron tomahawks pass from tribe to tribe. Odd bits of hoop iron are laboriously ground down to a sharp edge and are beginning to replace the stone axe or spear-head. Prongs of stout wire take the place of the old wooden ones. When once these innovations make their appearance, it is wonderful with what rapidity they spread from group to group.30
As well as the sense of nostalgia in this description at the imminent replacement of stone tools with steel ones, there is also an admiration at the creative ways in which the new materials were adapted and incorporated into new kinds of tools and implements. This praise of the Aborigines’ innovative skills, and of their capacity to transmit innovations between groups, contrasts with the views of some of the earlier writers who saw in Aborigines’ cultural products only imitation and derivation. In Spencer and Gillen’s account, however, Aboriginal peoples’ incorporation of new materials was limited to those communities close to, or living on, European settlements; away from those settlements the ‘old ways’ continued. They noted:
Up to the present time, however, except in the immediate neighbourhood of settlements which are fortunately too small and too far between to affect large numbers of the natives, the latter have lived in blissful ignorance of the age of iron, and have continued to fashion their weapons and implements with the old



52 Writing Heritage
flaked and ground, or, more rarely, chipped stone knives and hatchets.31
Here again is the conservatism that underpins much of Spencer and Gillen’s writing on Aboriginal culture. It is as though with some relief that they observe Aboriginal people far from European settlements continuing ‘blissfully’ to maintain their old stone tool traditions. There is a judgmental tone in this writing, in which the authors’ disdain at the use of introduced iron and steel is transferred to the Aborigines; thus, those remote people who do not use these new materials are ‘fortunate’, as they retain a ‘blissful ignorance’ of those innovations. In the writings of Spencer and Gillen, as in those of many Europeans, depictions of Aborigines often contained imagery of romanticism, alongside that of primitive wretchedness. There was, in this sense, nearly always a notion of the Aborigines as ‘other’ either in a positive or a negative way.32 Spencer and Gillen shared the preoccupations of many Europeans in classifying the Aborigines on the basis of their material culture. Maintaining Spencer’s opposition to the uncritical imposition of preconceived classificatory labels on Aboriginal material culture, these writers argued that the juxtaposition of different types of stone implements defied any typology based on Old World nomenclature:
The Central Australian natives make and use stone implements which are usually described as typical, respectively, of both the Palaeolithic and Neolithic periods. Some of their flaked knives are practically as crude as those of the extinct Tasmanians, while the chipped ones which exist side by side with the former are as well made as those found in European barrows. Amongst the Central Australian aborigines it is simply a question of the material available. If they have a supply of quartzite, then they make flaked or flaked and chipped implements. As a matter of fact they always have this material available, and therefore every tribe uses it. In



‘Nothing to be Discovered’ 53
some parts they also have stone, such as diorite, which is suitable for grinding, and then they make, in addition to the flaked knives, the so-called Neolithic ground axe. Had such a tribe as the Arunta or the Warramunga become extinct, leaving behind it, in the form of stone implements, the only traces of its existence which would have persisted, the modern ethnologist would have been not a little puzzled by finding side by side the most crudely and the most beautifully flaked and chipped stone implements and at the same time ground axes.33
This confusion of types led Spencer and Gillen to surmise that the Central Australian Aborigine, ‘so far as his stone implements are concerned, is a member of both the so-called Palaeolithic and Neolithic stages in the development of the human race’.34 Their view of these peoples’ ‘decorative art’ was similarly based in a notion of evolutionary progress:
The Australian savage has long ago got beyond the stage of decorative art which consists mainly in the emphasising, usually by the addition of pigment, of some peculiarity, such as a knot or a node, in the material out of which he makes his implements.35
Spencer and Gillen’s work was to become an important reference point during the early years of the twentieth century for future anthropological and historical work on Aboriginal culture and society. Other such writings included those by A. W. Howitt, who was well known for his early work on the Aboriginal peoples of southeast Australia. He was a government official in the Gippsland region of Victoria, and a correspondent for the Aboriginal Protection Board. In this latter role particularly he was able to collect information from a wide range of correspondents, including Aboriginal people.36 Like many others of this period and subsequently, Howitt believed that by documenting details about the Aborigines, he was preserving for posterity details of the cultures and societies of



54 Writing Heritage
a people who had disappeared. He wrote in the Preface to his 1904 publication Native Tribes of South-East Australia:
By far the greater part of the materials for this work was collected and recorded before 1889. Since then the native tribes have more or less died, and in the older settlements of South-East Australia the tribal remnants have now almost lost the knowledge of the beliefs and customs of their fathers.37
Howitt’s social and political contextualisation of material cultural heritage enabled him to offer some unusual insights into these integrated aspects of Aboriginal life. In the following extract concerning a stone axe quarry at Mount William in Victoria he details the connections between social and political organisation, land, and material culture:
The right to hunt and to procure food in any particular tract of country belonged to the group of people born there, and could not be infringed by others without permission. But there were places which such a group of people claimed for some special reason, and in which the whole tribe had an interest. Such a place was the ‘stone quarry’ at Mt William near Lancefield, from which the material for making tomahawks was procured. The family proprietorship in this quarry had wide ramifications, including more than Wurunjerri people.38
Here, the interplay of social and political relationships with the distribution and management of rights, and the association of these with activities such as food procurement and hunting, displays an intuitive notion of the integration of ‘heritage’ and culture in Howitt’s writing, that seems to have eluded many other writers of his time. While there was an increasing number of close-grained, detailed studies of particular Aboriginal cultural and language groups, at the same time there was also a continuation of the kind of generalised compilations of the type we saw with the writings of Worsnop and



‘Nothing to be Discovered’ 55
Brough Smyth. Another writer in this latter tradition was Northcote W. Thomas, a Cambridge graduate, described as an ‘eccentric’, who in 1908 became British Government anthropologist in Nigeria.39 Thomas published an ‘armchair study of Australian kinship’ in 1906, in which he argued for cultural variability:
It must be understood ... that a description of a tribe in one district is not necessarily true of a tribe in another or even in the same district.40
In his brief discussion of Aboriginal art, Thomas referred to ‘drawings on rocks, trees, sand, and other objects, which stand in no close personal relationship to man’ as ‘elaborate representations, consisting of circles, patches, and sinuous lines’. He claimed ‘inasmuch these diagrams are used in the totemic ceremonies of the emu totem, it may be doubted how far they are technically art; probably they are better described as magical designs’.41 Where these drawings used by ‘Central and Northern tribes during their initiation ceremonies’ could not, in Thomas’s view, be defined as ‘art’, neither could the images and designs of other Aboriginal groups, as he wrote:
Among the Eastern tribes drawings on bark and figures moulded in earth or made of wood were in use; and we can hardly distinguish the ground-drawings of the Central tribes from these other products, which do not obviously come within even a popular definition of artistic products.42
Continuing his ‘survey’ of Aboriginal art, Thomas eventually ‘finds’ some designs used among Central Australian peoples that, in his estimation, warrant the label ‘art’:
Occasionally designs are found on rocks similar to those in use at the totemic ceremonies; they have, according to the natives, no meaning; here we seem to be in the presence of real artistic productions.43



56 Writing Heritage
Here, despite the apparent absence of meaning of these designs, Thomas was impressed by the artistry in them. Although he seems to have appreciated the diversity of Aboriginal cultures, his writing displays an evolutionary approach, wherein he accords some Aboriginal societies as producing ‘art’, while others’ cultural expressions are merely ‘magical designs’. Thomas summed up his views on the diversity of Aboriginal expressive culture, writing that:
To describe in detail the arts and crafts of even a single Australian tribe would be a work of some magnitude. A survey of the whole field might be interesting to the technologist; but the ordinary reader might fight shy of a systematic treatment of the manufacture of stone weapons alone, not to mention other industries. ...
He had some comments as well on the use of metals to replace stone and other materials:
Although the Australian has learnt to use metals, in his native state he was guiltless of any acquaintance with them. His knives, his axes, his spearheads were of stone, bone, shell, or wood. The manufacture of stone implements has always been a great feature in the culture of peoples unacquainted with metals, and the Australian is no exception to this rule.44
Thomas’ observation of the Aborigines’ rights in stone quarries was possibly a reference to Howitt’s remarks:
Before leaving the subject of stone implements it may be mentioned that, according to some authorities, the tribes which had no suitable stone within its own boundaries was [sic] at liberty to send tribal messengers to a quarry and procure what they wanted without molestation. On the other hand, we hear of private ownership of quarries at which axes were procured, but possibly customs differed.45



‘Nothing to be Discovered’ 57
This brief description of tribal boundaries and of the rights that Aboriginal people asserted regarding stone materials is an important acknowledgment of the connections between people, material items and place. While writers such as Roth, and Spencer and Gillen discussed the manufacture and use of stone tools, and the production of art and ceremony, as integral to Aboriginal peoples’ lived culture, this approach was not common in European writings at this time. The references in Howitt’s and briefly in Thomas’s writings to the quarry and ownership rights are an important reminder that all material objects associated with Aboriginal people must be considered within particular contexts of time, place and cultural milieu. Recognition of this contextualisation is often absent from writings by Europeans, many of whom discussed physical objects such as stone tools devoid of any sense of the connection between these objects and the Aboriginal people who made and used them. This separation of things from humans is particularly striking in the writings of some of the amateur collectors of stone tools discussed later. It is also a critical factor informing many Europeans’ views about the objects that were taken from Aboriginal societies and landscapes and placed in museums, universities and private collections.46 Items such as bark paintings and stone tools were portable, and were often removed by Europeans from their original cultural, geographical and social contexts, and circulated and discussed within entirely new, European contexts. Apart from the ethnographic writers who recorded details of stone tools and art in their cultural contexts as part of their work, there were other writers who noted the presence of objects – stone tools, bark paintings and the like – in the landscape. Observations of these tools situated in place, or the evidence of their manufacture, indicated recognition of Aborigines as living in the land. Making and using objects, creating and using art sites, and conducting ceremonial performances were all ways in which Aboriginal people marked the land, and maintained their



58 Writing Heritage
connections to the land and to their spiritual worlds of ancestors and totemic figures. These were all, in turn, part of the bundle of objects, beliefs, practices and actions that may be broadly termed Indigenous ‘heritage’.
Marking the landscape
A frequently observed mode of marking out features of the landscape that was practiced by the Aborigines was the inscribing on rock surfaces and cave walls. Aboriginal peoples’ markings on rock and cave surfaces were of enduring fascination to Europeans who sought to record, classify, explain and preserve these markings in a variety of different ways. Many Europeans who travelled through or visited areas in the pursuit of some non-ethnographic project – such as geological work, natural history, geographical or scientific surveys, or in the application of policy and administration – observed signs of Aboriginal occupation or presence through markings in the landscape. One such person was Stuart Love, who noted the presence of Aborigines during his 1910 prospecting expedition through Arnhem Land. On 18 August he wrote of his impressions of their iron tools:
Traces of blacks – fresh tracks, recently felled trees, old ‘wet camp’, and fire-places of all ages – were numerous all day; the natives here evidently have iron tomahawks and good ones at that.47
In this brief observation Love conveys an impression of the living, active presence of Aborigines – a striking contrast to many of the writers surveyed earlier, whose narratives were imbued with a profound sense of a people long gone. His praise of the Aborigines’ iron tomahawks also presents a counterpoint to the common tendency of many writers to bemoan or condemn the Aborigines’ adoption of iron and steel materials and tools.



‘Nothing to be Discovered’ 59
Other rock markings: New South Wales sites
It was not only stone and iron tools that signalled the presence of the daily activities of Aborigines in the landscape. Art sites also continued to provide interest. As well as art sites in remote northern, central and Western Australia, those in metropolitan and rural areas of southeastern Australia captured Europeans’ attention. One of those who wrote about New South Wales rock engravings was W. W. Thorpe, founding curator of ethnology at the Australian Museum in Sydney, and predecessor to Fred McCarthy.48 In 1909 Thorpe described a visit to some of these sites:
While on a collecting visit to Bundanoon in October of last year, my attention was directed to the existence of two Rock-Shelters which contained Aboriginal pictographs. ... Both are of the usual form found wherever the Hawkesbury Sandstone occurs and frequently used by the Aborigines for camping in, the cooking of food, and sometimes for burial.49
Like many of his contemporaries, Thorpe wrote of an absence of Aboriginal people in these areas:
The shelters and drawings have been known for forty years. Aborigines have not been resident in the district during that period, though parties of them have been known to pass through.50 Special attention may be directed to the following. Shields occur frequently as carvings, likewise fish and turtle, whilst gravings of the human figure are freely made along with other objects of natural history. As far as the Bundanoon pictographs are concerned, I do not think the objects have any ritual significance or esoteric meaning. Their presence may be accounted for in the following manner. ‘Art,’ we are told, ‘is the expression of human emotion in drawing, music, ornamentation, &c.’ Perhaps in the personnel of a tribe one or more of its members possessed a penchant for drawing, and the artistic taste has expressed itself on these rough walls.



60 Writing Heritage
Some of the objects are fairly true to nature, others again are below the average of Aboriginal art.51
Thorpe’s description presents a dry, dispassionate account, in which the rock images of these Aborigines are described as at best ‘fairly true to nature’, and at worst, ‘below the average of Aboriginal art’. Nonetheless, he has no doubts about designating these figures as ‘art’. In his discussion on the ‘meaning’ of these engravings, there is a clear sense that he considers ‘art’ as separate from ‘ritual’. A somewhat different voice is that of Dr Alan Carroll, a Sydneybased anthropologist and medical practitioner, who founded the Royal Anthropological Society of Australasia in 1885, and was editor of its journal, Science of Man, until 1911. Writing in 1911 in Science of Man, Carroll praised the rock art of the Sydney Aborigines:
Very few persons, even in Sydney, and less numbers in more distant places, are acquainted with painted and carved rocks in their own neighbourhoods. These real antiquities, left them by the former inhabitants of Australia, previous to the white colonists reaching these shores, are still to be seen in the forests and on the sea shores. There, on the highest hills, on the most precipitous cliffs, the pictures, symbolical of the myths relating to the earliest beliefs of the Australian blacks, are carved, and when it is remembered that they had no iron or other metal tools to make these carvings with, but only pieces of shell, quartz obsidian, or their equally breakable stone axes, to carve these works with, the time and patience to make these pictures, carved upon the compact sandstone rocks, must have been very great.52
Carroll’s writing is more poetic than Thorpe’s, as he offers an evocative picture of these images. Yet there is also a discourse of lack, where Aborigines were described as having ‘had no iron or other metal tools to make these carvings with’. Their own materials, in Carroll’s view, were seemingly fragile and delicate – barely



‘Nothing to be Discovered’ 61
sufficient to inscribe the kinds of images seen on these rock faces. Two interrelated themes are illustrated by both Thorpe’s and Carroll’s writings. One concerns the relationship between ‘art’ and other elements of Aboriginal culture, such as ritual and religion; the other theme is the evident interest expressed by many writers in the purposes, functions and meanings of Aboriginal designs and images. The rock images in the Sydney and New South Wales region were of interest on the basis of their proximity to closely settled and urban centres, and also as a consequence of their fragile and much eroded condition. Perhaps these markings, in contrast to the more immediately visually striking rock images in northern and western Australia, also captured the imagination of European observers because of the presumed elusive nature of their makers. Many Europeans were intent on gathering information from the more closely settled areas of Victoria and New South Wales. For these regions, they constructed an image of a long-departed people whose former existence could only be speculated from fragments of stone, traces in the landscape, or enigmatic markings on trees or rocks.
Different perspectives: experience versus speculation
The diversity of views on Indigenous heritage in Europeans’ writings demonstrates that there is no single, homogeneous ‘European view’, just as it is false to suggest a unitary, essentialised notion of Indigenous societies. This diversity encompassed writings by those who were ‘in the field’ and wrote from experience and observation, and writings from others in urban centres. Some Europeans thought that an understanding of Aboriginal society could only be truly gained by working and living among Aboriginal peoples in the regions in which they lived. This ranking of experience over speculation and theorising informed many writings. It occasionally resulted in rivalries and conflicts between those whose claims to authority in their knowledge of Aboriginal society were based in their extensive



62 Writing Heritage
experience in remote locations with Aboriginal communities, and others who wrote from metropolitan centres and underscored the theoretical basis to their knowledge claims. These differences in perspective were further complicated by the persistent notion held by many Europeans that there was an ‘authentic’ Aboriginal culture that was to be found in remote or ‘outback’ locations; and they used this image of an ‘authentic culture’ to inform their views on Aboriginal culture and society generally. Such presumed ‘authentic’ Aboriginal communities, living an idealised ‘traditional’ lifestyle and untainted by European impact, were posited as the norm, against which all other ‘versions’ of Aboriginality were compared. These idealised ‘authentic’ communities typically inhabited the remote regions of northern, central and Western Australia – regions that increasingly became the focus for travellers, visitors, and anyone wishing to study or to observe ‘real’ Aboriginal peoples. Some writers who ventured into these remote regions to conduct field studies, or to reside there for long periods of time, developed a notion of their own authority. They held that their understanding of Aborigines was more accurate than that of others who either made only brief visits to Aboriginal communities, or who formed their views solely from the work of others.
Expressive culture: the corroboree
Europeans’ desire to collect and document Aboriginal culture was not limited to material objects; writers and observers were also interested in the expressive aspects of Aboriginal life. The apparently ubiquitous ‘corroboree’ was one Indigenous cultural expression frequently observed, recorded and commented on. In his 1896 report on the Horn Expedition, Spencer noted the wide use of the term ‘corroboree’:
The term corroboree is usually applied indiscriminately by white people to any one of the so-called dances of the aborigines; but



‘Nothing to be Discovered’ 63
there are in reality at least two very distinct classes of corroborees or, as they are called by the McDonnell blacks themselves, ‘quapara.’ One set may be called ordinary corroborees, such as are held at any time, and which women and children may watch; but in addition to these there is another and a very distinct series, which may be spoken of as sacred quapara, which no woman or child is permitted to see, and which are intimately connected with certain Totemic subdivisions of the tribe ...53
Europeans were keen to obtain visual and aural records of these activities, as well as written ones, and they made good use of still and moving photographic equipment and sound-recording devices. One of the implications of these aural and visual technologies was their impact on the ways in which Europeans sometimes imposed their own notions of time and space on Aboriginal societies. An illustration of this juxtaposition of European and Indigenous understandings of time is from the journal of Frank Gillen, the long-time collaborator of Baldwin Spencer. Gillen’s entry for 4 May in his diary of Spencer and Gillen’s 1901 fieldwork in Central Australia records that the ethnographers were summoned by the promise of a corroboree:
At the Station by 8 o’clock Spencer had just fixed up his apparatus for enlarging quarter plates when a nigger arrived summoning us to the corroboree ground, where several men were about to dance the Ilyarnpa so that we might get snapshots. When we reached the ground we found them only half-decorated and as it meant waiting another hour to get them in full rig-out, we gave them some tobacco and flour and told them we could not spare time to photograph them today.54
Here, Gillen’s comment about having no time to photograph the impending ceremony suggests a tension between the demands of Europeans’ timeframes and priorities, and those of the Aboriginal people. The comment also draws attention to the role of photo



64 Writing Heritage
graphy in Spencer and Gillen’s ethnographic work. The making of a visual record played a significant part in, and was integral to, their Central Australian work.55 Anthropologist Nicolas Peterson has argued that Spencer and Gillen’s commitment to photography ‘arose out of the intersection of the limits that face verbal communication in general, when in the presence of complex performance, and the significance of visual information within the emerging natural science fieldwork orientation’.56 The photographing of Arrernte ceremonial life by Spencer and Gillen was part of a complex process of their engagement with these Aboriginal people. Although, as Peterson argues, ‘the photography cannot, necessarily, be assumed to have been imposed on [Aboriginal] people’, this technology, and the social processes associated with its use, certainly were not without effect on the Aboriginal people. Invariably, photographing ceremonies would have involved Spencer and Gillen in complex negotiations and trading relationships with Arrernte, the latter usually comprising payments of food. In some instances, too, ceremonial performances were ‘staged’ – at least in part – perhaps for the specific purpose of obtaining a visual record, but also for a range of other reasons having to do with the local politics of Aboriginal–European relations at that place and time. Gillen, apparently, had a particularly prominent role in arranging such performances. In 1896 for example, he helped to arrange for the holding of a major ceremony in Alice Springs, called the Engwura. Mulvaney and Calaby claim that ‘Gillen’s prompting, his tribal prestige and official status, probably turned the balance and ensured that a ceremony actually took place at all’.57
Policy and administration
Studies and observations on Aboriginal culture and heritage were not conducted in isolation from the politics of administration and



‘Nothing to be Discovered’ 65
control of Aborigines. The early years of the twentieth century were significant in terms of the growth of this administration and control by the Commonwealth Government. The formulation and implementation of policy through the introduction of new laws and administrative measures had wide-reaching implications for the ways in which European-Australians viewed, interacted with and wrote about Aboriginal people. This expansion in bureaucratic and administrative control also impacted on the means by which Europeans conducted their fieldwork and recorded their observations of Aborigines, with consequences for their perceptions of all aspects of ‘cultural heritage’, including notions of preservation and protection. Anthropologists, missionaries and settlers were all instrumental in the formulation and implementation of laws and policies relating to Aborigines. Much of this control and administration activity was focused on the Northern Territory, which became a Commonwealth Territory in 1911 and was one of the regions most subject to the Europeans’ scrutiny. The Commonwealth introduced the Aboriginals Ordinance 1911, which established a role for a Chief Protector of Aborigines.58 The first appointee to this position, which also combined the position of Chief Medical Officer, was Herbert Basedow, the Adelaide-based medical expert, anthropologist and geologist. Basedow was familiar with the Northern Territory, had participated in previous expeditions, and had published reports on ethnology and geology for that region. He resigned, however, after only a short time in the position, and was replaced by Baldwin Spencer. With Commonwealth control over the Territory, the new administrative structure provided, among other things, for the appointment of officials who would perform inspection, monitoring and reporting roles. As a first step in its administration, the Commonwealth dispatched a group of experts to examine and report on the Territory’s ‘prospects for development of its human, pastoral and geological resources’.5 9 This Preliminary Scientific Expedition included experts in geology, medical and health issues,



66 Writing Heritage
and also the anthropologist Baldwin Spencer. As well as advocating control of Aboriginal peoples’ relations with intruders, and the need for various ‘civilising’ measures, the report of this expedition recommended further studies of the Aboriginal people in the Territory. This highlighted that writings on Aboriginal heritage were enmeshed in the wider issues of race relations, and subject in many ways to bureaucratic administration and the control of Aborigines. One important control measure which had implications for Aboriginal studies was the establishment of reserves.
Protection in reserves
A focus for attention in the Northern Territory was the question of how to ‘control’ the effects of rapid encroachment of Europeans on Aboriginal people. The fraught racial and gender issues resulting from the impact of missions and governments, and the expansion of pastoralism, mining and development, necessitated an expansion in governmental and administrative machinery for control and regulation. One way of regulating the impact of white settlement was through the creation of reserves, and the nature, extent and purpose of these reserves was the focus for much debate and discussion. These reserves also had implications for the control and preservation of Aboriginal ‘heritage’ – typically designated as ‘antiquities’ at this time. Various State administrations had already created reserves as a means of controlling and regulating Aboriginal peoples’ lives.60 The declaration of reserves was enshrined in legislation regulating Aborigines in the Northern Territory with the introduction of the South Australian Aborigines Act 1910. That, and successive laws, also sought to regulate employment and to restrict sexual relations between Aborigines and whites.6 1 Baldwin Spencer had recommended the establishment of reserves in his 1912 Preliminary Report, in order to control contact between Aborigines and Europeans.



‘Nothing to be Discovered’ 67
Arguing that the creation of reserves would assist in the ‘care and uplift’ of Aborigines, Spencer wrote:
In view of the settlement of the country for which provision is now being made, there is no other practicable policy but that of the establishment of large reserves, if the aboriginals are to be preserved, and if any serious effort is to be made for their betterment.62
Subsequent Ordinances and reports provided further for the establishment of Aboriginal reserves; and some church and missionary bodies, humanitarian organisations and anthropologists also supported the formation of reserves as a means of ‘protecting’ Aboriginal people from the rapidly encroaching impact of European settlement.63 Reserves, it was argued, would be the key to educating and ‘civilising’ the Aborigines. The establishment of reserves was also a response to a series of events involving conflict between Aborigines and intruders in Arnhem Land.64 In 1935 the Commonwealth Government commissioned Melbourne anthropologist Donald Thomson to conduct an investigation and report into these conflicts. Thomson argued in his reports for ‘absolute segregation’ of Aboriginal people.65 Other specialists who strongly advocated segregation for Aboriginal people in reserves included Olive Pink and Frederic Wood Jones. Pink was a consistent critic of the pervasive influence of missions and missionaries on Aboriginal people, and argued for a ‘secular reserve’ in Central Australia for the Walpiri people.66 Another promoter of reserves was Frederick Wood Jones, professor of anatomy at Melbourne University, who argued in 1934 for complete segregation of Aboriginal people ‘still living under full tribal conditions’ in reserves to prevent ‘contamination’ by European civilisation. He concluded that ‘no solution will ever be found for the problem of the uncontaminated native save that of preserving him from contamination by the establishment of inviolate reserves for his sole occupation’.67 Wood Jones believed



68 Writing Heritage
such reserves should serve to maintain Aboriginal peoples’ ‘traditional lifestyle’:
Moreover, since all ceremonial and tribal life depends upon the integrity of certain topographical features connected with the totemic beliefs of the people, these reserves must be established in the traditional hunting-grounds of the tribes concerned.68
This view resonates with that of another expert, Adelaide physical anthropologist John Burton Cleland, who wrote to the government in 1936 urging the protection of waterholes he believed to be of spiritual significance to Aboriginal people living in Central Australia, discussed later in this book. The gradual realisation by Europeans of the importance of place as a component of Aboriginal heritage is discussed in more detail later. This linking of Aboriginal peoples’ land-based activities and spiritual beliefs with ideas about protection – albeit by means of segregation in reserves – was an important basis for later considerations of protection of Aboriginal culture and heritage. Indeed, the Aboriginal reserves were promoted by some politicians as providing protection for cultural heritage, as will be seen in later years with the discussions on heritage protection in the Northern Territory.

Change and innovation
From 1911, with the Northern Territory now a Commonwealth Government possession, there was a heightened focus on that region as one where Europeans could, in their view, experience ‘traditional’ Aboriginal culture. The European concept of a ‘traditional’ Aboriginal culture was problematic, as some writers have pointed out, since this implied a society unchanged since before the advent of Europeans, and denied the possibility of change.1 Nonetheless, writings by anthropologists, scientists, administrators, and other Europeans who visited, studied, observed or commented on Aboriginal societies continued to illustrate a tension between this notion of ‘tradition’ and the very real presence of change, innovation and adaptation that the writers were witnessing in Aboriginal societies. These processes of change were in part initiated or exacerbated by the presence of Europeans. Where some writers maintained an image of Aborigines as remote, timeless, and bound by ‘custom’, others explicitly commented on the changes and innovations that they observed. The former kinds of writings portrayed Indigenous peoples within an idiom of sentimentality and nostalgia, constructing an image of a



70 Writing Heritage
carefree ‘noble savage’ lacking needs and desires beyond those necessary for survival. Other writings, by contrast, represented Aborigines as ‘ignoble savages’, a people who were rude, degenerate and untrustworthy.2 In many of the former kinds of writings the predominant mode of representation is of people living in harmony with their environments, content with using the raw products of nature. In these schemes, Aboriginal societies were presented as fossilised remnants from some former age, resistant to change, and whose exoticism and lack of adaptability was leading to their disappearance or extinction. In contrast with this view, other writers presented images of Aboriginal societies as inherently innovative and adaptive, creatively integrating introduced materials such as iron and steel into their technology. Writings of this kind often commented favourably on Aboriginal peoples’ creative and innovative capacities in their manufacture and use of stone tools, and also in their production of decorative designs and images on rock surfaces, cave walls, bark sheets or in personal adornment. There is not a sharp dichotomy between writings that represented conservative, ‘traditional’ societies and those that represented innovative, creative societies, since the same writer may portray varied images. For example, there might be a number of different images within a single text; or a writer might portray conservatism in his or her private correspondence and diaries, yet admire innovation in public writings. The specific ways in which writers commented on conservatism or innovation also varied considerably. A writer could portray an Aboriginal society as inherently conservative and, where change is observed – such as with the use of iron in stone tools – judge this innovation harshly, presenting it as the result of corruption or ‘contamination’ by European ideas and influences. Alternatively, a writer might regard this innovation as indicative of a creative and adaptive society. Related to innovation, an idea of ‘value’ was attached to the creative products of Aboriginal societies and this was crucial as



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 71
increasing interest in cultural items saw them destined for commercial markets. Such ‘artistic’ products as bark paintings and works on other media, including paper, typified this change. Concurrently with the emergence of art and craft industries, Europeans’ desire for objects, including sacred items such as tjurungas, gathered pace. At the same time as notions were developing of the value of, and market for Aboriginal cultural objects, there was an emerging idea that the collection of these objects was not an end in itself but part of a process. In addition to collection, this process embraced circulation, exchange and display. It also played a crucial role in the transformation of these objects from a category designated as ‘ethnographic objects’ or items of heritage – which were commonly referred to as ‘curiosities’, ‘specimens’ or ‘antiquities’ – into the categories of modernity: the commodity and the fine art object.
Images on bark and rock
As the collecting of bark and other cultural objects gathered pace, Europeans continued to debate whether decorative features on wooden and stone weapons, domestic implements and utensils, as well as on rock and cave walls, bark sheets, and on the human body, constituted ‘art’ in the same sense as ‘western’ art. This debate also focused on the nature of creativity that was demonstrated in these designs, as Europeans pondered whether this creativity was an innate quality, springing from an inherent capacity for originality, or whether it was more imitative and derivative. Underpinning these concerns and anxieties were the intellectual schemes of evolutionism and primitivism that informed Europeans’ questions as to whether Aborigines – who were often thought of as ‘primitive man’ – were indeed capable of refined creative and artistic expression. Some of these themes can be seen in the writings of Baldwin Spencer, as he described his encounter with Aboriginal painters of designs on bark.

Spencer’s barks, Oenpelli 1912
In 1912 while at Oenpelli, in west Arnhem Land, Spencer found himself admiring some Aboriginal artists at work preparing images on bark:
This morning a native brought in a little bark-drawing. They are very fond of drawing both on rocks and the sheets of bark of which their Mia-mias are made. The drawings are quite unlike anything that the Arunta and Central tribes attempt. There is a complete absence amongst them of the conventional designs, with concentric circles and spirals, that are so characteristic of the Arunta, indeed these are completely wanting amongst the Kakadu and all the Coburg Peninsula tribes, as well as amongst the Melville Islanders. The animal and plant drawings amongst the Central tribes are extremely crude, and so conventionalised as rarely to be recognisable, but, on the other hand, their geometrical designs are wonderful, especially those associated with their totems and sacred ceremonies.3
Spencer’s description forms a discourse of comparative ethnology, and his comments contribute to a debate about the nature or extent of cultural diversity within, and between, Aboriginal groups throughout the country. Some Europeans thought that all Aborigines were a culturally homogenous group, and that deviations from uniformity in material culture could be explained by local variations in the nature or the availability of raw materials. Substantial differences were explained by the intrusion of foreign elements, or innovations introduced externally. Yet others thought the Aborigines capable of relatively wide local variation within, and between, cultural groups as they responded and adapted to change. Spencer’s appreciation of variability among Aboriginal people was informed by his wide experience in Central Australia and the northern regions.



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 73
A significant aspect of Spencer’s comments on the Oenpelli bark paintings is his comparison of the work of the Aboriginal person with European artists, and his focus on the artist as individual. He wrote:
To-day I found a native who, apparently, had nothing better to do than sit quietly in the camp, evidently enjoying himself, drawing a fish on a piece of stringy-bark about two feet long and a foot broad. His painting materials were white pipe clay and two shades of red ochre, the lighter made by mixing white pipe clay with pure ochre, and a primitive but quite effective paint-brush, made out of a short stick, six or eight inches long, frayed out with his teeth, and then pressed out so as to form a little disc, shaped like a minute, oldfashioned, chimney-sweep’s brush.4
Spencer’s comments here speak powerfully to European perceptions about leisure, and questions of labour, productivity and the relative uses of time amongst subsistence-based hunter-gatherer societies. Spencer’s finely detailed observation of the Aboriginal people carrying out bark painting, framed as though this were a leisure activity divorced from the everyday concerns of the communities’ survival needs, conjures up the notion of what American anthropologist Marshall Sahlins has termed an ‘affluent society’. Sahlins critiqued stereotypical views of hunter-gatherer societies that portrayed these as impoverished by their need to labour long and hard in order to merely survive. Instead, Sahlins posits that these societies find as much time to devote to creative and ceremonial pursuits as they do to subsistence activities.5 Spencer’s description of the process of bark painting emphasises the individuality of the artist:
It was most effective, and he held it just like a civilised artist sometimes holds his brush or pencil, with the handle between the thumb, then crossing the palm and out below the little finger, so that all four finger-tips rested on it, or sometimes it passed out of



74 Writing Heritage
the hand above the little finger. Held in this way, he did line work, often very fine and regular, with very much the same freedom and precision as a Japanese or Chinese artist doing his more beautiful wash-work with his brush.6
Here Spencer draws on a familiar comparative mode, likening the Aboriginal bark painter to ‘civilised’ artists, whether European, Japanese or Chinese. This equation of Aboriginal creative expression with the already familiar concept of ‘art’ in its western and Oriental forms represents a shift away from the perception, held for a long time by many Europeans, that the creative expressions and products of Aboriginal peoples were little more than ‘primitive’ works, and did not warrant categorisation as the refined expressions and products of ‘civilised’ societies. In this primitivist sense, ‘native’ peoples’ designs on bark, along with their cultural objects generally, were considered as ethnographic items, and as objects of curiosity, to be collected and displayed in museums and scientific organisations. The people who produced these were not perceived as individual ‘artists’ with particular creative abilities. Rather, the designs and objects were regarded as the products of unnamed ‘primitive’ societies, whose work was the collective result of age-old adherence to unchanging ‘custom’ and ‘tradition’. Spencer extols the virtues of the bark paintings:
They are so realistic, always expressing admirably the characteristic features of the animal drawn, that anyone acquainted with the original can identify the drawings at once. On further acquaintance with them and, after inspecting the paintings with which they had decorated the walls of their wurlies, I found that there was a notable range of ability amongst the artists. There was relatively, in proportion to the limited scope of their work, very much the same difference between them as between British artists, not so much, however, in regard to subject and conception as to execution, though indeed there was some hint of



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 75
the former, one artist in particular specialising in mythological subjects.7
Spencer was so impressed with the artistry of these Aborigines that he decided to commission some of the works for the National Museum of Victoria:
They were so interesting that, after collecting some from their studios, which meant taking down the slabs on which they were drawn, that formed, incidentally, the walls of their Mia-mias, I commissioned two or three of the best artists to paint me a series of canvases, or rather ‘barks,’ the price of which was governed by size, varying from one stick of tobacco (a penny halfpenny) for a twofeet by one-foot ‘bark,’ to three sticks (fourpence halfpenny) for ‘barks’ measuring approximately three feet by six feet and upwards. The subject-matter I left entirely to the artist’s choice. As a result I was able to secure some fifty examples that illustrate the present stage of development of this aspect of art amongst the Kakadu people. It was interesting to find that the natives themselves very clearly distinguished between the ability of different artists and that my own non-expert opinion in regard to their relative merits coincided with their own. The majority of those that I collected and that now hang in the National Museum at Melbourne are regarded as first-rate examples of first-rate artists. The highest price paid was actually fourpence halfpenny but, as the artists are now unfortunately dead, the market value of the ‘barks’ is considerably higher than when they were originally purchased in the Kakadu studios at Oenpelli.8
The barks that Spencer collected continue to form an important part of the collection of the Melbourne Museum. It was some time before bark paintings and other cultural objects moved out of the cabinets of museum ethnographic displays onto the walls of homes, shops and corporate buildings, and into the galleries of fine art institutions, to be displayed explicitly as ‘art’ objects.9 Although Spencer was by no means the first to collect bark paintings, this may



76 Writing Heritage
have been one of the first instances in which these paintings had been purchased using money as currency rather than the more usual tobacco or other trade goods. Spencer had earlier remarked on decorative aspects in his 1914 ethnography, Native Tribes of the Northern Territory. He wrote that ‘there is, of course, much that is common, in regard to their Decorative Art, to all the tribes of Central and Northern Australia, especially in respect of the ornamentation of their commoner weapons and implements’.10 Within this broad homogeneity, however, he noted the variation among individual artists, explaining that:
In the Kakadu, Umoriu, Geimbio, Iwaidji and other tribes excellent rock and bark drawings are met with. There is a great deal of difference in the capacity of various men in this respect, some of them being much better than others.11
Referring to the pieces illustrated here, Spencer noted that they ‘will serve to give a very fair idea of these bark drawings which are amongst the most highly developed and interesting of any made by Australian aboriginals’.12 Anthropologist Luke Taylor suggests Spencer’s purchase of the Oenpelli pieces played a significant role in the emergence of an art market:
Spencer’s influence on the development of a market for bark paintings outlasted his own short stay at Oenpelli in 1912. Cahill continued to purchase paintings for Spencer until 1920, and the returns to some artists were substantial for the times. ... The publication of Spencer’s work (1914 and 1928) and donation of his collection to the National Museum of Victoria introduced the outside world to the art of this region. While his work did not immediately stimulate a demand, Spencer himself was energetic in creating an awareness of its aesthetic value. His influence also lasted in a more direct way in that subsequent collectors have read his



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 77
works and some have shown them to more contemporary artists as a means of commissioning ‘traditional’ works.13
Despite the importance of Spencer’s bark collection, Taylor notes that the full development of a market did not occur until some time later.14
Collecting bark paintings: from ethnographic curiosity to art market and cultural industry
There is a long tradition of Europeans acquiring bark paintings from Arnhem Land that predates Spencer’s Oenpelli visit. What is of interest in Spencer’s collecting in 1912 is his emphasis on the Aboriginal as individual artist, and that he paid for the barks with currency – a shift from the more usual form of payment using tobacco. The references in Spencer’s text to the Aborigines as artists raises again the question about use of the terms ‘art’ and ‘artist’ in Europeans’ writings to refer to Aboriginal creative works. Some recent commentators have questioned whether the term ‘art’ is appropriate to denote Aboriginal cultural products and expressions.15 Peter Sutton and Christopher Anderson suggest that Aboriginal languages do not possess a word with the exact equivalent meaning to ‘art’ in the western sense, though they do have a range of words and expressions that refer to ‘sign, design, pattern, or meaningful mark’.16 Anthropologist Nancy Williams has a similar view, as she wrote in her study of the bark painting industry at the eastern Arnhem Land mission settlement of Yirrkala:
There is no ‘artist’ role, nor is there a word indicating such a role in the Aboriginal dialects spoken at Yirrkala. The artist is a recent phenomenon, an English-labeled role referring to those men designated by artists, that is, to those whose paintings appeal aesthetically to whites and sell well.17



78 Writing Heritage
As well as anthropologists, traders, missionaries and administrators also participated in the trade and acquisition of bark paintings and other Indigenous cultural objects. At Oenpelli, for example, Spencer was assisted by Paddy Cahill, long-time resident and sometime administrator of the reserve, who continued to acquire bark paintings for Spencer long after the latter had departed. Europeans did not acquire bark paintings only for their aesthetic and ethnographic qualities. These objects were sometimes offered (either willingly or reluctantly) by Aborigines in order to negotiate with Europeans, or for other purposes such as economic transactions. In his study of art among the Yolngu people at Yirrkala, anthropologist Howard Morphy states that ‘art objects entered transactions between Europeans and Yolngu early in the history of contact’.18 Morphy outlines the beginnings of Europeans’ collecting of art from this region:
In the mid-1930s, within months of the establishment of Yirrkala mission station, the Reverend Wilbur Chaseling had commissioned paintings and carvings from the Aborigines who moved into the settlement. The paintings were sold to museums in the southern states, and a few objects were marketed in Sydney through the Methodist Overseas Mission. On both sides there were dual motives for the transactions. Chaseling saw craft production as a means of earning money to provide Aborigines who moved to the mission station with luxury items, in particular with tobacco. ... In this respect the production of craft was integral to the mission’s overall objective of achieving economic self-sufficiency. ... Thus artwork and handicrafts became commodities sold by Yolngu to obtain tobacco and resold by the mission as a small but necessary part of its overall economic strategy.19
The role played by bark paintings in political and economic transactions between Europeans and Aborigines came to prominence several decades later, in the 1960s, when Aboriginal people



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 79
from Yirrkala used these objects to petition the Government in relation to proposed mining developments.
A reflection on collecting
Europeans’ fascination with collecting has a long history. Collecting satisfies many urges including curiosity, desire and wonderment; it is a means of ordering the world in a microcosm wherein the small comes to represent the large. Collecting also fashions self, nation and identity.20 The preoccupations and anxieties of Europeans about the exotic and the different provide a rationale for collecting that persists today. Anthropologists and others have sought to develop a ‘theory’ of collecting. James Clifford writes on forming collections that ‘some sort of “gathering” around the self and the group – the assemblage of a material “world,” the marking-off of a subjective domain that is not “other” – is probably universal’.21 He says, ‘In the West ... collecting has long been a strategy for the deployment of a possessive self, culture, and authenticity.’22 Clifford outlines the history of collecting in western societies, from the early formation of ‘cabinets of curiosity’, through various schemes of taxonomy and classification, to evolutionism and exoticism.23 The changing ordering of objects over time (which broadly mirrors the development of anthropology), in Clifford’s view, illustrates the ways in which objects change categories, as he explains:
While the object systems of art and anthropology are institutionalized and powerful, they are not immutable. The categories of the beautiful, the cultural, and the authentic have changed and are changing. ... The widely publicized Museum of Modern Art show of 1984, ‘“Primitivism” in Twentieth Century Art’, made apparent (as it celebrated) the precise circumstance in which certain ethnographic objects suddenly became works of universal art.24



80 Writing Heritage
Nicholas Thomas writes, too, of the ways in which objects change contexts, observing that:
As socially and culturally salient entities, objects change in defiance of their material stability. The category to which a thing belongs, the emotion and judgement it prompts, and the narrative it recalls, are all historically refigured.25
Commenting on the correlation between terms used to refer to collected objects, and the categories these objects occupied within the collecting milieu, Thomas suggests:
The artifacts of non-Western peoples were known over a long period as ‘curiosities.’ Occasionally, this term, or ‘curios,’ also embraced certain kinds of antiques and classical relics, and (in the absence of the qualifier ‘artificial’) even natural specimens – coral, bones, and mineral samples. ... The connotation of such labels shifted, and in some contexts the words arguably do not tell us much about either the cultural construction of the things collected or the notion of the process of collecting.26
For much of the century, objects produced by Aborigines were collected, admired or speculated about as Europeans readily assimilated these objects into their pre-determined classificatory schemes. These were objects of ethnology; they were curiosities, antiquities or specimens. Often destined for the museums of the empire and its peripheries, these objects formed the basis for ethnology displays that served to satisfy the seemingly insatiable curiosities of observers as well as collectors. They were also objects of science – strange, wondrous objects certain to mystify their collectors, and inviting endless discussion and speculation as to their origins, purposes and meanings. These objects were perfectly suited to the Europeans’ fascination for classification and the creation of typologies and analogies. By creating order from these objects, order could be similarly established for their presumed makers.

Collecting stone tools
A lot of collecting activity was focused on stone tools, the presence of which prompted collectors to engage in debates and discussions about the origins, uses, manufacture, form, function and meaning of these ubiquitous cultural items. In the field, Europeans observed Aboriginal people making and using these items, as seen earlier in the narratives of people such as Roth. Other aspects of stone tools that invited Europeans’ interest were their use in trade and exchange; the extent to which they were decorated, or simply produced for use; and the incorporation of introduced materials, such as iron and glass, into the manufacture of these implements. Some collectors confined their activities to obtaining their ‘specimens’ through an extensive network of correspondents and collectors in rural areas; others ventured out and collected these items for themselves. Tools were usually picked up from the surface, and were often found in quarries or at the sites of presumed former Aboriginal camping grounds. In their correspondence collectors compared, contrasted and described their collections, new additions, or specific features that drew their attention. There was a particularly active group of these stone tool collectors in Victoria, as historian Tom Griffiths describes:
... it was European Victorians who led the collecting mania for stone. Their side of the country was one of the areas of Australia most completely settled by Europeans, rapidly impoverished of organic Aboriginal presence; only the stone residue endured, it seemed, and it was for many decades more discussed than were the surviving people.27
Griffiths refers to the period of intense stone tool collecting activity in Victoria and elsewhere, as ‘the stone age’. The ‘stone age’, he asserts, ‘was a phrase commonly used to label Aboriginal culture, but it could more appropriately describe this early twentieth-century period of artefact collecting by Europeans’.28



82 Writing Heritage
One of the most influential writers and collectors was Baldwin Spencer, who had already made an important contribution to the discourse on stone technology and collecting in his ethnographies of Central Australia, and also in his 1901 Guide to the Australian Ethnographical Collection in the National Museum of Victoria (subsequently revised in 1918, and again in 1928). In a 1914 paper Spencer claimed that the ‘the nature and form of the implements is not a question of the stage of culture, but depends primarily upon the material available’.29 This notion of material availability dictating form and function was to influence many collectors over some period of time. An important feature in the debates and discussions about material cultural heritage was the tension between those who wrote from experience and observation, and those who resided in the urban and metropolitan centres and wrote more from theory and speculation. This dichotomy is well represented in the correspondence between George Aiston and W. H. Gill.
From the field: George Aiston and his correspondents
In June 1920 the Sydney Bulletin carried an article entitled ‘A cry from W. H. Gill, of East Camberwell’. In this call for a debate on stone tools Gill wrote:
In Australia we are living within the Palaeolithic stone age of Europe. As the primeval men lived with the aid of their stone knives and axes in prehistoric times, so the Australian natives in Central and Northern Australia are living within this 20th century. This in itself is a wonderful fact to realise.30
The reference to the palaeolithic is a familiar discourse of European ‘Old World’ evolutionary categories, and highlights the struggle by writers and collectors to fit new objects into their known categories. With this palaeolithic or ‘old stone age’ context in mind, Gill



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 83
pondered the manufacture of stone tools by the Aboriginal people of Victoria. He continued his ‘open’ letter in the following tone:
Australian abos. [sic] chipped and ground their stone axes and knives, while the abos. [sic] of Tasmania only chipped their stone implements. So far as the aboriginals of Victoria are concerned, it is only within the last five years that we have had any knowledge that they made and used the miniature stone chipped knives and scrapers which are common also to the Palaeolithic and Neolithic ages of Europe.31
In Gill’s comparative perspective, he distinguishes between an Australian Aboriginal stone technology and Tasmanian and Victorian types on the basis of form and mode of manufacture. He refers to a local find in elaborating his views on comparative Aboriginal material culture:
A fortunate find on the sea coast of South Gippsland, on one of the ancient native camping grounds, disclosed the fact that the natives of Victoria used miniature tools, which were found in large numbers, made of diorite, flint, chert, quartz and fine rock crystal.32
Gill’s invoking of a local South Gippsland implement as a reference point for defining a ‘Victorian’ Aboriginal stone industry led him to speculate about the purposes of these small tools:
Collectors here are much concerned, and a good deal of controversy exists as to the purposes for which the natives used these stones. That they were made for a positive use is certain, for there is a constant repetition of identifiable types and shapes. And, singular to state, the majority of these knives and scrapers bear a marvellous resemblance to the Neolithic types of ancient Europe and Egypt.33
Like many observers and collectors, Gill drew on the familiar repertoire of classical ‘Old World’ archaeological terminology of ‘Neolithic’ and ‘Palaeolithic’ to categorise Australian Aboriginal stone tool technology. Also like other writers, Gill could not



84 Writing Heritage
implicitly, at least – reconcile how these two tool types could be found contemporaneously. Thus his apparent surprise at the presence of neolithic-like implements in south-east Victoria, within what he considered to be generally a ‘Palaeolithic stone-age’ Australia. He called for readers’ views on these stone tool traditions, indicating a particular interest in regional variation:
What I want to do now is invite correspondence with persons living in close touch with the natives, and who take a keen and intelligent interest in the life and customs of the tribes of North and Central Australia ...34
Gill’s article initiated two decades of correspondence with George Aiston. Unfortunately, the unevenness of the historical record has meant that we are left only with Aiston’s letters to Gill creating a rather one-sided conversation. Nonetheless, Aiston writes in considerable detail, such that we can glean a picture of his particular views on material culture and related aspects of Aboriginal life. George Aiston was born in South Australia and he was a keen observer of Aboriginal societies and collector of Aboriginal artifacts. He had an active career as a soldier and policeman, having served in the South African war.35 Through his police work in remote locations he developed a lifelong interest in Aboriginal culture, which formed the basis for his correspondence and writings.36 In addition to his private letters, in 1924 he published a work on Central Australian Aborigines in collaboration with Melbourne writer Dr George Horne. His wide circle of correspondents included, in addition to Gill, Robert Henderson Croll, C. C. Towle and Stan Mitchell.
In the Australian Dictionary of Biography, Philip Jones says that Aiston ‘encouraged the view that Aboriginal stone-tool technology was an entirely Indigenous development’. Jones describes Aiston as having ‘belonged to a generation of scientists and self-taught natural



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 85
historians who gathered material objects for data’. Jones states that Aiston’s ‘ethnographic collection and knowledge increased as the local Aboriginal population dwindled ... [and] he retained the Aborigines’ trust and fought for their interests’.37 In August 1920 Aiston introduced himself in a letter to Gill, writing that ‘I am the Constable in charge of the Diamantina Police District, and am stationed at Mungeranie’. He explained that ‘I have been here for nearly 8 years now – and have been practically living with the blacks all that time’. His remark about ‘practically living with the blacks’ typifies the views he espoused in much of his correspondence, in which his claims to expert knowledge of Aboriginal culture were based on his experience among the Aboriginal people. He explained to Gill his developing curiosity in Aboriginal life:
I joined the Police Force 19 years ago ... I had only recently returned from South Africa and was curious to find out whether they had any customs in common with the African negro. In 1904 I went to Tarcoola and my curiosity had got me keenly interested in the blacks – and the ancient drawings that I saw on the granite rocks in the vicinity of Tarcoola took me off trying to find a connection between the African blacks to studying our own blackfellow for his own interest.38
Here Aiston promotes his view about the autochthonous origins of Aboriginal culture and heritage – a view at odds with some writers who argued that Aborigines were not sufficiently ‘advanced’ or ‘creative’ to have produced the designs and images that Europeans found. As Aiston put it, ‘... I have never heard anything in the blacks’ traditions that would hint at them ever having lived in any other country but this’.39 Like many observers and commentators, Aiston often noted the changes in Aboriginal uses of materials, especially the replacement of stone with steel in their technology. He wrote:



86 Writing Heritage
... of course nowadays [sic], these stone tools are not used much, a piece of bottle make [sic] a better scraper than the best stone, but the bush blacks still make stone tools – bottles are almost as scarce away from the tracks as steel knives – the ambition of a blackfellow now is to get a broken buggy spring, this sharpened on the thin end makes a splendid tuhla.40
Aiston’s notion that ‘bush blacks’ only availed themselves of materials that were within a certain vicinity – i.e., at a distance from the infrastructure of ‘civilisation’ such as railway and buggy tracks, suggests a dichotomy between ‘remote’ and ‘fringe’ Aborigines. Here, the reference to the ‘bush black’ conforms to (or contributes to) an essentialised stereotype of the ‘stone age’ Aboriginal, who, remote from the influence of Europeans, resists or is distant from the pressures of cultural innovation and the inevitable encroachment of European society. Aiston had a particular interest in observing Aboriginal people making and using stone tools and other implements, and was didactic in imploring others to base their views not on speculation but on experience and observation. His acute observations of Aboriginal manufacture and use of stone tools enabled him to form firm opinions on processes of change and innovation that were taking place in Aboriginal societies. For example, while admiring the Aborigines’ decorative skills displayed in their stone tool manufacture, he despaired at the replacement of their ‘traditional’ tools with introduced metal ones:
... the tiny leaf-shaped scrapers are used for decorative purposes, some blacks take a great pride in the decoration of their tools, but unfortunately, here a steel pronged fork has taken the place of these fine tools in most cases.41
In this extract there is a tone of sadness that permeated many Europeans’ writings on the changing stone tool traditions and introduction of European materials.



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 87
Aiston relates to Gill his keen observations of Aborigines’ use of stone tools, illustrating the kind of meticulous and closely observed detail that runs throughout his correspondence:
I[n] the Abo. Column of the Bulletin of June 10th, I read an article by you on the stone tools used by the black in Gippsland. I have been keenly interested in these things for many years, but have been unable, though living among the blacks here, to find out how these tools were made ... I have seen a blackfellow chip a stone into a rough knife, to serve a temporary purpose, such as to scalp a wild dog, in these cases the blackfellow has simply picked a stone that would break as he desired, wedge [sic] it between other stones, and tap it with a stone until he got the edge he wanted, the whole process and result were crude.42
Aiston viewed the Aborigines as having a very pragmatic approach to the ways in which they made tools to suit particular purposes. He saw these people as inherently adaptable, able to find materials as and when they needed them, and to accommodate these for immediate purposes. Aiston’s comment also reinforces his argument for observation over theory and speculation. Collections of stone tools at this time were derived mostly from surface finds. Collectors scoured what they presumed were old Aboriginal camping and midden sites, river banks, quarry sites and other localities likely to yield the tools. As this activity predated the advent of systematic archaeological excavations, there was as yet no sense of depth as a factor in stone tool locations, nor of the stratigraphic layers in which artifacts might be found. Gill and Aiston corresponded about the subject of surface finds, and Aiston’s reply in September 1920 provides an interesting insight into his thinking on this important aspect of Aboriginal heritage:
... you speak of all the things that are only found on the surface in Australia, but what is the surface, I have been at the various bores in this country and they have brought up sea shells and fossils from



88 Writing Heritage
4000 feet ... In Adelaide I was shown strata at the back of the old Police Barracks and was assured by the Government Geologist that it was the oldest strata in the world – this was practically on the surface. In this country one can not help feeling the age of the world – miles of packed stones in one place that look as if seas has [sic] washed over them for ages and packed them in their places – in other places twisted melted stones that looks [sic] as if they had been vomited out of the earth ... and when going south through the Flinders Range one sees the hills reared up on end – the strata is vertical instead of horizontal – I was at Andrewilla near the Queensland border a couple of months ago – and on a little peninsula jutting out into the water there were thousands of fossilized roots, animal dung, fish and bird bones ... I have seen fossilized diprotodon bones on the surface at the Kallakoopa ...43
This poetic discourse presents a powerful image of the unpredictability of geology, with wonder at the endless surprise and variety at all the things found on the surface. The text compels us to abandon preconceived ideas about surface versus depth, and erodes any assumptions about a direct correspondence between depth and age. It also provides a convincing image of an archaeology profoundly shaped by natural forces of geology, climate and topography. Aiston’s letter shows a man able to move between ruminating philosophically on the vagaries of geology, and expressing the uninhibited joy of ‘discovery’:
... I walked over the creek here yesterday just for exercise – and before I came back I had filled both pockets with good specimens of all sorts – I thought of how you enthusiasts would enjoy yourselves among these stones – I wonder that someone does not come up here and have a look at them.44
He also demonstrates humility in the face of a vast knowledge to be gained about stone tools:



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 89
... I have been thinking over the possibility of my writing up all that I know of the Aboriginals and their use of stone tools – but the subject is vast – ever since I have been corresponding with you I have had stone tools shown to me that I had never before heard of, I am beginning to feel that I just know enough to know how little I know ... 45
Although humble in tone, Aiston’s prose nonetheless suggests that he held firm views on innovation and change in Aboriginal stone technology. In October 1920 he wrote to Gill outlining again his conservative view of Aboriginal culture:
... the great trouble with most writers it seems to me – is that they assume that the aboriginal has a progressive brain, and that he has improved his tools from time to time – I hardly think this is so, as all the blacks I have seen never seem to think at all, give them any tool, say a steel chisel, it is sharp when they get it, they will use it for all purposes – rough work and smooth – and when it gets blunt they will drop it and take to the old stone tools again – I do not think that they go to much trouble with their stone tools.46
This comment contrasts starkly with Aiston’s earlier view, cited above, that ‘some blacks take a great pride in the decoration of their stone tools’, in reference to decorated leaf scrapers he saw. Perhaps he struggles to come to terms with the process of innovation in what he regards as an inherently conservative culture? In any case, the Aborigines’ preferred reliance on their familiar tools suggests more a soundly entrenched sense of material technology than a lack of progressive capacity. Aiston took the opportunity to opine against those who based their views on theory and speculation:
... the great mistake most theorists make is that they credit the blackfellow with a more educated brain than he actually possesses they [the Aborigines] are very conservative, very, what was good enough for ‘my old man’ – is good enough for me, is the blackfellow’s religion, he will misuse tools, but would never think of



90 Writing Heritage
doing a job unless he had the right tool for it – I have tried for years to get some of them to put handles in my stone axes – but they will not do it because they cannot get the proper wood – they reckon a makeshift handle is no good and I cannot explain that I want them for show only.47
In this passage, Aiston’s observation conveys an acute understanding of Aboriginal ‘tradition’. Although his comment implies that the Aborigines were resistant to change, it is also a striking reference to the notion of ‘heritage’, if this is defined as a body of traditions, practices, techniques and knowledge that is handed down through the generations. Aiston’s writing suggests his admiration and respect for the Aborigines and their cultural traditions. Yet at the same time his language occasionally also promotes pejorative views shaped by evolutionary notions of racial hierarchies. His writings can be read in multiple ways. For example, his description of tool use might suggest rigid tradition, as he would have it, or alternatively, a notion that the Aborigines had a fastidious concern for accuracy and perfection in craftsmanship. Aiston’s comments can also be read as suggesting that the Aborigines sought the best correspondence between form and function in their selection of stone for tool making and use. Although Aiston’s writing suggests that Aborigines were selective in their choice of materials, there is also the sense of spontaneity in their approach to the development and use of stone tools. Whatever choices and decisions they made in regard to material technology, the Aborigines faced the inevitability of transformation with the introduction of European materials and techniques. Like many writers, Aiston despaired at these changes, maintaining an idealised view of an unchanging ‘stone age’ culture. He wrote on this to Gill in 1920:
Re. Boomerangs. It is very hard to get one that one is sure that some steel or iron tool has not been used on, this country has been



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 91

I have a tuhla inside with a stone one end, on the other a scrap of what look[s] like a piece of iron troughing, this is fixed on with animal sinews. I am keeping it as a curiosity – to mark the transition stage.48
This description encapsulates the kind of tension present in Europeans’ writings when the writer is faced with the seemingly endless range of innovative practices by Aboriginal people in making use of introduced materials. Aiston’s reference to his having kept a tool displaying an ingenious combination of both ‘traditional’ and introduced European materials – a kind of ‘transition’ tool emphasises his keen sense of the curious. Aiston frequently returned to his argument against those who theorised about stone tools:
... your remark of the squabbling among the theorists reminds me of my experiences in Adelaide – I can’t argue, it goes against my grain somehow – but I told different people in town of the use of stone tools that I had seen actually in use and some of them argued to such good purpose that they almost convinced me that they knew more about them than I did – even though their knowledge was only theoretical.49
From private reflections to published work: Aiston and Horne’s Savage Life
Aiston’s views on tool manufacture and use articulated in his private correspondence were given a more formal voice in his book Savage Life in Central Australia, written in collaboration with Melbourne doctor George Horne in 1924.50 In contrast to the earlier works on Central Australian Aborigines by Spencer and Gillen, Savage Life was more a compilation of anecdotes and snippets of information than it was a rigorous ethnographic study. Horne was the primary



92 Writing Heritage
writer, having composed this work largely from Aiston’s letters. He introduces the work:
Many of his [Aiston’s] letters have been incorporated almost verbatim, and this has led to some repetition. But I have let it stand rather than alter the drift of the narrative.51
To further enlist readers’ confidence, the narrator then establishes the credentials of Aiston, whose knowledge of the matters contained in the book was based on living closely with Aborigines and becoming their ‘friend and protector’:
For the last eight or nine years Mr. Aiston has dwelt at Mungeranie, although more than twenty years he has spent in aborigines’ haunts. His position led him to become their friend and protector, and many were the stories told to him by those who were boys when the first explorers penetrated the country. The opportunity to collect this information must soon pass, for it is stored with men eighty or ninety years of age and their confidence is not easily won.52
This technique by which the writer’s authority is established by virtue of having been there amongst the Aborigines was a device often used by ethnologists in their published works, although it was not always articulated explicitly in this way. This passage indicates the trust accorded to Aiston by his Aboriginal informants, and also suggests that the authors of this book held a respect for the wisdom of the old men. At the same time it reminds us of Europeans’ zeal for collecting information, objects and other records from the Aborigines as a means of ‘preserving’ the Aborigines’ culture, while the people themselves were seen to be dying out. This theme of loss of tradition is apparent throughout Savage Life, as illustrated by the following passage:
The superiority of his [the white man’s] tools has forced from the field the stone tomahawk and the wooden digging-stick. ... The sharpened steel from a shear-blade or buggy spring is bound with



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 93
sinews on to a stick, making an adze; but some few strictly conservative workers remain who use stone even for the rough hewing of the boomerang and discard the glass fragments when smoothing down the ridges.53
Here the authors’ description clearly articulates the capacity of the Aborigines for innovation. However, the replacement of stone with introduced materials also led these writers to sadly declare that the Aborigines could no longer be studied in their ‘pristine’ condition:
The time, therefore, has gone by for obtaining knowledge of the blacks’ mentality uncontaminated. Many years of contact with the whites have robbed them of the freshness of their native customs.54
Aiston’s frequent observations on the Aborigines’ apparently casual approach towards the use of their tools and implements are reiterated:
In describing these tools it must always be remembered that the casual nature of the black does not allow him to keep any tool for the one purpose. ... He is just as likely to use his best stone knife to scrape a weapon as he is to use any flake that he may pick up.55
This passage could also be read to suggest that Horne and Aiston regarded the ‘casualness’ they observed among the Aborigines as an inability or unwillingness of these people to set standards of quality in the selection, manufacture and use of tools. However, if their writing was read in this way, then it would necessarily raise questions about cultural relativity: whose standards are used to make judgement on the way other cultures make and use technology? Horne and Aiston employ their argument about the casual nature of Aboriginal tool use to support a point about the difficulties of classifying tools:
At the same time he may get an affection for a certain tool and only keep it for the purpose for which it is most suitable. For example, it



94 Writing Heritage
often happens that a blackfellow will work for a month to get a white man’s razor. He will shave himself, usually without soap, and as many friends as he can persuade to let him operate upon them; and then he will try the razor on a piece of wood, with the result that the face of the razor is broken out. He will then light-heartedly throw it away. This casualness is what makes it so hard to say specifically that a tool is used for any one purpose, but in describing them I have carefully watched and asked until I could arrive at what was aimed at in each particular tool, and so have classed them.56
This text shows the same kind of detailed, descriptive first-person narrative that Aiston used in his personal correspondence. There is the same keenness for classifying that permeated many Europeans’ writings about material culture. In his comment about classifying stone tools based on close observation and questioning, Aiston departs from the more rigid classifying practices of some collectors particularly the early ones. These latter were more likely to have emphasised form in their classification of these objects, in other words, the intrinsic attributes (such as shape, size, etc.) of the objects themselves.57 Cultural and environmental factors – such as how these objects may have functioned in society, where they were found, and their relationships with other aspects of Aboriginal culture (such as ceremony) – sometimes of secondary importance to other writers, were often a focus in Aiston’s writings. Aiston also described his observations of the division of labour and specialisation associated with tool-making and tool-use. With Horne again as narrator these aspects are described in Savage Life:
Mr. Aiston tells me that in the old days, before the advent of the whites in this country, practically all of the stone tools and weapons were made by the old men. The young men and the women looked after the finding of food for the camp. The old men sat down at some convenient water-hole where there was a supply of stone tools and wood for weapons, and put in their time in keeping the young men supplied. Not all were good weapon-makers. Some specialised



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 95
in the making of the stone tools and usually confined themselves to that alone. Very often a man specialised in only one tool, and made nothing but that.58
A sense of nostalgia pervades the above passage, where the stone tools and their makers evoke a lost culture that has all but disappeared with the coming of the Europeans. The correspondence between Aiston and others suggests that some Europeans’ views on what we now call ‘Indigenous heritage’ were not so much predetermined, but rather, were shaped gradually through their observations, and formulated through their private writings and reflections. By engaging with others, ideas took shape, possibly changed over time, and were then articulated in more public forms such as published works. Aiston’s ideas about collection seem to have been shaped through his correspondence with others. He explained in 1929 to Sydney collector Towle:
I collected my first lots of stone tools from those that I actually saw in use, and did not pick up any from the old camps for some years after I started collecting.59
This focus on collecting tools actually in use is in marked contrast to the methods of Stan Mitchell and some other Victorian collectors (such as Kenyon) who acquired tools predominantly from old Aboriginal camping grounds. Aiston continued to argue his point about the need to study tool use, as he explained to Towle on 10 March 1930:
I would suggest that a careful study of the types of wooden weapons and utensils made by the blacks of any district should be carefully studied – then the type of stone found in the district should be studied – this would give you some idea of the type of tool that would be used.60



96 Writing Heritage
This rather convoluted prose illustrates Aiston’s keen interest in the total environment – including cultural and geological aspects – that informs Aboriginal tool use. Consistent with his experience-based views on Aboriginal tool use, Aiston wrote to Towle arguing against the possibility that aesthetics or an ‘artistic sense’ were factors in the manufacture of tools:
But really, brother blackfellow did not make tools for show, he made them for use, they lasted as efficient tools for such a short time that he did not waste any more time on them than was necessary to give them a sharp cutting edge, directly the tool became blunted it was thrown away and another flake chipped off. Where stone was plentiful, as in the immediate vicinity of this place, the tools were discarded very soon, but in places where the stone was scarce the worn out tool would be used until there was not a scrap left ...61
Aiston’s reference to ‘brother blackfellow’ may be read in several ways. It conveys a patronising, somewhat pejorative tone not uncommon in some Europeans’ attitudes towards Aborigines at the time. It also contains a hint of sarcasm, especially with the precursor ‘but really’, perhaps indicating exasperation that his correspondent dared to suggest that Aborigines employed decorative features in their stone tools. Finally, the reference possibly suggests Aiston’s feeling of camaraderie with the Aborigines in his district. This passage also reprises Aiston’s familiar themes that Aborigines’ stone tool use was pragmatic, situated and localised, and dependent upon the availability of raw materials (the latter point drawing on the influence of Baldwin Spencer). Aiston expanded on this latter theme, criticising those people who based their analyses of tools from collections that were made devoid of any context of ‘living societies’, as he wrote to Towle on 16 May 1930:



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 97
Unfortunately, nearly all of the collections I have seen are more or less worthless. It is unfortunate that the tools were not collected while the blacks were still living and using them.62
This is an important point, especially in the context of today’s debates about ownership, rights and interests in archaeological and ethnological collections (often referred to as ‘cultural property’) held in museums and other collecting institutions. To Aiston, the ‘value’ of Aboriginal material culture resided not so much in its importance to scientific study and ethnological display, as in its context within Aboriginal culture and society. Drawing on this point he again elaborated to Towle on the importance of cultural and environmental context for understanding tool use and function:
It is impossible to give an opinion on any stone tool unless one can see a lot of them in position on the camping sites, to see the stone supply from which the stone was got, and to know the type of weapons that were used and the nature of the wood used in them.63
In addition to his fascination for stone tools, Aiston was also a keen observer and commentator on other aspects of Aboriginal culture, such as ceremony and stone circles. He discussed these prolifically with his various correspondents, taking firm stands on every subject. Writing to Towle in 1931 he argued that stone circles, which were ‘very common in this district’, were not for ceremonial purposes but ‘here they were only built by the children in play’. He expounded on this, once again basing his views on observation:
I investigated some many years ago, they were on the Diamentina [sic], and at that time some of the down country. Scientists stated that they had some ceremonial significance, but the old men assured me that they were only made in play, and several times they showed me rings and patterns that they themselves had made as children. Since then I have seen the children, dozens of times, building these places ...64



98 Writing Heritage
Here there is an interesting interplay in Aiston’s correspondence, between what he thought were the views of ‘scientists’ who argued for some ‘ceremonial significance’ of these stone circles, and those of ‘the old men’ among the Aborigines. It is significant that Aiston chose to support the latter’s views that these formations were for ‘play’. Once again, this illustrates Aiston’s consistent emphasising of ‘lived experience’ over armchair theories and speculations from afar. While Aiston was always ready to voice an opinion about the cultures of the Aborigines in ‘his region’, he was reluctant to offer an explanation for stone circles in other parts of the country, as he explained to Towle in March 1932:
I am a wee bit nervous about venturing an opinion on the stone circles of your people. They had so many differing customs from our people that it is not safe to dogmatize. ... The old blacks have assured me hundreds of times that the circles were nothing more or less than playgrounds and I have been shown circles that some old grey headed buck assured me he had made in his childhood.65
Here Aiston’s distinction between ‘our people’ and ‘your people’ shows his recognition of regional and cultural diversity, albeit using the patronising idioms of the time. He resists making Australia-wide generalisations, opting instead for local variation. It is also a comment on Aiston’s sense of ‘owning’ the Aboriginal people with whom he spoke around the area he lived. Aiston’s somewhat idealised notion of Aboriginal culture, and his aversion to fully acknowledging the processes of change that he was witnessing, extended beyond commenting on stone tool technology into the realm of other aspects of Aboriginal culture, such as ‘art’. Writing again to Towle, he described the changes in art designs:
With us pictorial drawings are only just coming in, I did not see any weapons decorated with native animals until recently and now nearly every weapon that is brought to me is carved with all sorts of animals, this was not a characteristic of the old blacks and they



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 99
express contempt for the younger blacks who so degrade their boomerangs. The old men had their own markings, which were to a certain extent their trade mark, but they were always conventional lines and curves.66
This comment importantly foreshadows much later debates around issues of ownership of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander designs, artworks and ‘cultural property’. Aiston’s use of the term ‘trade mark’ is a perceptive observation on the complexities of clan, and other group-based rights in markings and designs, and recognition of the existence of these rights within and among Aboriginal cultures.
More on collecting: missions, tourists and the disappearing tuhla
Aiston echoed some of the other concerns of collectors, writers and observers about the disappearing knowledge of methods of stone working among Aboriginal people, and the changes wrought by the influence of missionaries and other Europeans on Aboriginal cultural production. He wrote to Towle about some of these concerns:
I have been trying to get these kundi tuhlas ever since. I have had several but none of them were any good. Some had wrong stones in them and all of them were so set that they were useless for Ethnological purposes. There is no one in the country now who knows anything about them. All that are left are those born on the old Mission and they did not know anything at all about their ancestral weapons or the methods of making them. ... I think all of the churingas have been collected by the Mission people and have gone to Germany and America ... the Abos of near Hermannsburg have been doing a thriving trade for some years in making fakes for the Scientists, slate is plentiful there and a few



100 Writing Heritage
smears of grease gives them an appearance of age and there you are, five bob, please. The tourists and missions have spoilt them absolutely, the tourists will not buy their genuine things and insist on getting some thing else, directly the blackfellow understands what they want they will make them. Those return boomerangs collected along the east west line are all fakes, the blacks of those parts did not know or use the return boomerangs thirty years ago, in fact the boomerang was very little used over there, the thick timber rendered it practically useless, their principal weapon was a spear, the occasional boomerang was used mostly as a club to finish off game brought down with the spear.67
Here, Aiston’s moaning at implements having ‘the wrong stones in them’, and at the rampant collecting by missionaries and tourists, illustrates powerfully the theme of authenticity once again. He despairs at what he sees as the erosion of an authentic Aboriginal culture and its replacement with fakery and demand-driven tourist artifacts. Aiston continued to despair at this disappearing ‘authentic’ culture, as he wrote again to Towle in December 1934:
15 years ago I could have got you a hundred kundi tuhlas in a week, they would have cost me a stick of tobacco each, now it is a month of hard work to persuade a black to make one.68
Other collectors: Kenyon and Towle
Aiston’s advocacy for studying implements in the locations in which they were found and used suggests he had a relatively sophisticated approach to understanding Aboriginal material and cultural heritage. This interest in geographical and spatial factors was also apparent in the writings of some others, such as the Victorian-based collector, writer and naturalist A. S. Kenyon, an engineer who spent his working life with the Victorian waterways department. As with other amateur collectors, Kenyon’s full-time occupation, though not



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 101
directly relevant to the anthropology or archaeology of Aboriginal Australia, nonetheless did provide a useful context for his collecting work. Waterways are the arteries of a nation, and they also chart the histories and stories of the landscapes and the peoples within them. Kenyon’s work with waterways enabled him to travel along these seams of life, finding among them a congruence with his interest in Aboriginal stone culture that he could perhaps not have otherwise imagined. Kenyon was one of a number of people keen on natural heritage, and was an avid walker and naturalist – interests that inevitably led him to an intense interest in Aboriginal heritage. He was influenced by the teachings and writings of Spencer, and was drawn to the latter’s evolutionary view of human society. As with a number of collectors, Kenyon’s career in collecting stone tools spanned several decades. Like Aiston, Spencer and others, Kenyon demonstrated an intense interest in the classification of stone tools. Writing to Towle in 1929, he warned against imposing European notions of material culture onto Aboriginal use and manufacture patterns:
When you have had more experience in coastal work you will realise that the blackfellow who was quite unacquainted with anthropology, excavation and stratification did not leave implements behind unless he had been using them on the spot, and did not carry implements to a place where he had no use for them. ... Ergo Kitchen middens are not necessarily receptacles of culture – another instance of the grossly misleading influence of the European workers – unless water, shelter and food are all in the vicinity and the first two emphasised ...69
Clifton Cappie Towle, like Kenyon, was an ‘amateur’ collector of stone tools, who devoted his spare time to this activity. New South Wales-born Towle had studied music before becoming an accountant with the New South Wales railways, where he remained until his death in March 1946. In his obituary, Fred McCarthy described



102 Writing Heritage
Towle as ‘a man of serious nature [who] devoted many years of his life to a study of anthropology, geology, astronomy and botany as well as to literature and music’.70 Towle began to collect stone tools in 1922, and ‘pursued this hobby so assiduously that he finally accumulated a magnificent collection of approximately fourteen thousand specimens of all types of implements from many sites in New South Wales’.71 In 1928 Towle wrote enthusiastically to Kenyon of the potential for ‘finds’ around Sydney:
There are many camping grounds near Sydney and Newcastle which have hardly been touched, as yet. Only last Saturday I came upon a midden at Port Kembla, which is almost entirely hidden from view by the great sandhills which are gradually overwhelming it. So far as I can ascertain, collectors do not know of it. This indicates the amount of exploratory work that is necessary even near Sydney.72
Towle here evokes the kind of possessiveness that imbued many collectors’ writings: the desire to be first to find something, and the ever-present excitement of the possibility of ‘discovery’ of a new object or collection. Such new finds were invariably a subject for discussion, and among many themes, the question of function versus aesthetics in the design of Aboriginal stone tools provoked intense debate. Discussing the form and function of an axe, Towle disagreed with Kenyon that Aborigines had no sense of aesthetics or refinement in tool design:
... I do not believe that these implements were hafted. But I do think that the thick side of the implement was chipped into shape so that the user could handle it in comfort. But, you say the aboriginals were too primitive a people to waste time over matters of this sort. Why, then, did the people of the N.W. of Australia go to the trouble of making such delicate spear heads that would be broken at the first throw? Would not a mere flake have done just as well, and think of the saving to them in labour? ... I do not, in few



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 103
words, believe that the aborigines were so primitive that they did not possess a well developed artistic sense, and some common sense.73
Here, the question of ‘artistic sense’ is again present – this time in relation to stone tools rather than rock or bark paintings. Like Aiston, Towle had a pragmatic approach to stone tools, believing that the form of chipped stone tools was determined by the material used.74 This dependency on raw material did not, however, prevent Aborigines from imparting an aesthetic sensibility to the design and manufacture of their stone implements.
Local innovation versus imported developments
So conservative were some writers’ views on Aboriginal peoples’ capacity for innovation and development that any observed changes in material or other aspects of culture were explained by the introduction of ideas or technologies from outside Australia. Towle and others argued for imported innovations, while Kenyon thought new technologies were entirely local developments. Towle wrote to Kenyon on this:
... In this letter, I am about to make some bold statements, and I shall not mind if you reply that I do not know what I am talking about. ... Radcliffe Brown and others state that the ground axe was imported into Australia some time after the arrival of the aborigines. I am inclined to this view. Where did the lanceolate spear head come from? Was it also introduced? The preparation of the stone by burning may suggest some extra-Australian source.75
Kenyon disagreed, maintaining that the Aboriginal people had developed their cultures entirely within Australia:
... There is no evidence that the ground axe was imported into Australia either before or after the arrival of the abos [sic] if that implies that it came in as an inoculation [sic] into or as an addition



104 Writing Heritage
to an existing culture. Wood Jones is now pretty definite as to the outstanding purity of this race – in fact quite pure – which means very early arrival and no outside inoculations or successive waves, so if he is right, that theory goes. Why not face the simple fact that man with his brain supplies his needs with the material available, whether food material, or implement ditto, and thereby arrives at the same result everywhere without any interchange of ideas. ... The fact that the same tribe formed completely different types of implements within its own boundaries as the stone available justified, seems to me sufficient answer to the diffusionist heresy.76
Here Kenyon refutes the views of those who thought that new innovations were more likely to result from the diffusion of ideas, technologies and materials from elsewhere, rather than the product of local, independent invention and innovation. His remarks also imply a recognition of the variability within and among Aboriginal groups. Towle later explained his views on external influence and the importation of ideas and technologies to Elkin:
... There are some who believe that the aborigines developed all their stonework in Australia to meet their needs. These investigators in my opinion are too thorough-going. They will not admit an importation of any kind. They undoubtedly have much in their favour: local material and local needs explain in general the stonework found in the different areas. But I cannot believe that no importations from outside Australia took place after the arrival of the aborigines. The ground axe, for instance, I believe to be a later importation.77
More on the classification and typology of material culture
Another enduring interest of Europeans was in classifying the stone tools and other ‘specimens’ (as they often called them) of Aboriginal



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 105
culture. Stone tools in particular were regarded as indicators of cultural progress and of the status of particular groups in the evolutionary hierarchy. One aspect of classification that elicited debate concerned whether Australian Aboriginal culture was essentially one culture, or many. Although Aiston argued against generalisations, wanting to emphasise local variation, he nonetheless proposed a common origin for all material culture. Explaining this to Towle, he wrote:
I do not like to venture into the realms of theory, because one’s imagination can carry one a long way, but I am convinced myself that there was only the one culture, all tools evolved from a sharp edged flake and only the differing material made the slight difference in shape in the various periods and countries.78
Aiston was conscious, too, of the disparities between collecting strategies by different individuals, as well as the likely differences between Europeans’ notion of typologies and Aboriginal views on tool use and function. He outlined this view to Towle:
I have often thought that there are the two types of collectors, the one, who delights in collecting as many varieties of any one tool that he can ... and the collector who only wants one of each type, it would be possible, as for instance in Stan Mitchell’s collection, he has side scrapers, end scrapers, double ended scrapers, all of interest to a man who wants a series, but from the point of view of the Abo. craftsmen they were all scrapers, but one happened to have a sharp edge on one end and another had two sharp ends and another had a sharp edge on one side, they would all possibly be used to do the same work, and are not as a set of carpenters chisels would be, different tools.79
This notion that Europeans had a different way of classifying tools, and sought to categorise and label variation to a greater extent than may have existed in Aboriginal society, is reminiscent of the com



106 Writing Heritage
ments made by Walter Roth several decades earlier in relation to north Queensland Aboriginal material culture. These critiques of the classificatory schemes that informed collectors’ activities applied also to displays of Aboriginal cultural materials. Baldwin Spencer’s approach to the display of implements in the National Museum of Victoria was based on taxonomy, as he had explained in his 1901 Guide to the Australian Ethnographical Collection: ‘ ... the forms of shields used in different tribes are shown in one case, boomerangs in another, sacred and ceremonial objects in another’.80 Mulvaney and Calaby write of Spencer’s approach to classifying Aboriginal material culture that ‘by such shredded and fragmented presentation of material culture, its virtual organic unity, its cultural reciprocity and its ecological adjustments were obscured’.81 This comment on fragmentation pertains to Europeans’ approaches to Aboriginal cultural heritage generally. Another collector and writer with an appreciation of the diversity of Aboriginal culture was Melbourne-based Stanley Robert Mitchell. Mitchell had a keen lifelong interest in stone tools, and his vast collection of them developed over many decades was eventually to form part of the ethnographic collection of the National Museum of Australia. As with most collectors, Mitchell’s was a ‘spare time’ activity, his main occupation being in metallurgy. Since ‘his interest in minerals grew from accompanying his father on collecting trips around the basalt quarries near Melbourne’, it is likely that his metallurgical and ethnological pursuits were relatively compatible.82 Mitchell was active in a number of organisations, as honorary ethnologist, and a trustee and treasurer of the National Museum of Victoria, president of the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria, and a founder and President of the Anthropological Society of Victoria.83 Influenced by A. S. Kenyon, Mitchell was an advocate for the argument that local materials and conditions governed the forms and functions of stone tools. He also shared the views of those such



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 107
as Aiston that material technology was best understood in a wider context, as he wrote to Towle in 1935:
... I do not find that any of these broad generalizations can be made on one item of material culture when we take into consideration local environment, climate, flora, fauna, and many other factors we will never know of.84
Mitchell advocated using the auspices of the anthropology societies for such work, and extolled the advantages of collaboration between collectors:
It is in this way that we could use our Societies: formulate some very comprehensive investigation for a number of workers to tackle the problem as a team, which would necessitate years of work, and covering every possible phase before generalization would be of value. This watertight compartment, with each individual working alone, is of little good.85
The decades of the 1920s to 1930s saw, in addition to the busy work of amateur collectors and writers such as Aiston, Towle, Kenyon and Mitchell, a proliferation of published works on Aboriginal culture by individuals with more ‘professional’ backgrounds and ‘officially sanctioned’ experience among Aboriginal people. These latter included those such as Herbert Basedow, whose brief experience as Protector of Aborigines in the Northern Territory and role in geological and survey expeditions in the early decades of the twentieth century had well equipped him to write about Aboriginal people.
Basedow’s Australian Aboriginal
In his 1925 book The Australian Aboriginal, Basedow expressed views on Aboriginal art and material culture that were by now familiar themes in Europeans’ writings.86 Basedow’s regret over the



108 Writing Heritage
imminent ‘disappearance’ of the Aborigines, and emphasis on the urgency of collecting and recording the traces of their cultures, illustrates this:
There is no doubt that primitive art in Australia is a fascinating study which has not received the attention it merits; and unfortunately it is rather late in the day to think of making a start.87
Where some writers had thought Aboriginal art devoid of meaning, Basedow finds every design full of significance:
We have for too long looked upon aboriginal designs as meaningless, and upon aboriginal art production as being idle concoctions out of nothing which were invented just to make a thing ‘look pretty’. This is anything but the true position. An aboriginal artist knows no such thing as a design without motive or origin; to him the shortest line or the smallest circle conveys a thought.88
In a poignant reminder of the European project of collecting Aboriginal cultural products to fill their museums, Basedow makes a point that connects these objects with other living expressions of culture:
Bones, stone artifacts, and wooden implements will remain in our museums for ever, but the habits, laws, beliefs and legends are doomed to rapid extinction.89
Employing the palaeolithic analogy, Basedow described the Aborigines making images on cave walls, observing that ‘as did his palaeolithic relative in the Old World, the aboriginal during the rainy season spends much of his time under the cover of overhanging rock shelters, well within the cheerful influence of his never-failing fire’. Like Spencer, he, too, emphasised the role of the individual artist:
There are usually a few men in every tribe who have established a reputation as artists; and their work is prized by the heads and protected by tribal law from the hands of vandals who would at a



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 109
frivolous moment deface or disfigure a work of art which the tribe is proud to look upon as their own.90
Basedow’s narrative also highlighted the desire often articulated by Europeans for permanence in Aboriginal cultural heritage, as he wrote:
It is gratifying to observe that there is very little tendency on the part of the aboriginal, humble as he is, to destroy wantonly or deliberately a work designed to create an environment for him during his leisure or to protect his body and kin against aggression by evil during the darkness of night.91
Basedow also has much to say on the subject of Aboriginal stone implements, asserting that ‘there are not many places left in the world where the man of the Stone Age can still be seen roaming the wilds of his inherited possessions’. This notion of Australian Aboriginal societies as a kind of ‘living laboratory’ for the Stone Age appears in many European writings. Basedow comments on the Aborigines’ use of steel to replace stone:
... it is, of course, only to be expected that the superiority of the metal blades of the white man’s implements would appeal to the native who formerly had to spend hours making a crude cutting edge which only too often broke when applied to the test for the first time. We shall, however, treat the subject regardless of the alterations which have been brought about by our appearance upon the scene, and without attempting to draw up a hard and fast scheme of classification.92
Here Basedow proposes to construct his narrative on the basis of a presumed ‘ethnographic present’ in which Indigenous societies were described as though they were in a ‘pristine’ state, unchanged and unchanging since time immemorial. Like Aiston, Basedow highlights the need to observe and record the manufacture and use of Australian stone tools by Aborigines:



110 Writing Heritage
At the present time, whilst there are not only some of the primitive men alive still, but also a limited number of observers who have had the good fortune of seeing them at work, it is of vastly greater importance to record the living facts than to write exhaustively, nay, even speculatively, upon the comparative shapes and embodied techniques of artifacts whose stony composition will ensure their keeping, even fossilized, long after the men who made them, and the scientists who lived among them, have passed into oblivion.93
These remarks suggest that the ‘disappearance’ of Aboriginal societies did not necessarily only mean their actual removal (although of course this was occurring at an increasing rate). It also meant that the Aboriginal societies of their imagination – the ‘pure’, ‘stone-age’ societies they constructed as ideal types – in a sense, had ‘disappeared’, to be replaced by emerging new societies influenced by Europeans’ introduced technologies, materials and ways of life. In the same decade that Basedow’s comprehensive book was published, others were released that had a somewhat different approach. These were books by people who made relatively brief visits to regions of Australia, and whose works focused only marginally on Aboriginal culture. Examples of these kinds of works were writings by Norwegian naturalist Knut Dahl, and Australian adventurer Hubert Wilkins. Knut Dahl visited Australia near the end of the century, but his account of that visit was not published until some decades later, in 1925.94 His purpose in visiting Australia was ‘to explore the fauna of Arnhem Land, the northern peninsula of the Australian Continent, situated between the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Indian Ocean’.95 Dahl’s depiction of Australia was of a wild, uncivilised land. He made scant distinction between the country’s fauna and its human inhabitants:
The country we intended to explore was wild and primitive. ... For hundreds and hundreds of miles you may ride through this forest, straight into the heart of the Continent, without noticing much change. You meet smaller plains now and then, you meet

mountains and ridges, but the enormous forest stretches ever onwards. In fact, the whole of Northern Australia is, as it were, covered with a scanty canopy of the blue-green leaves of the forest. And under this canopy live only birds and wild animals and savages of the forest.96
Although only a few years separated the publication of Dahl’s account and those of both Spencer and Basedow, in style these works could not be further apart. Dahl’s publication was an account of a visit he had made some four decades earlier – yet its depiction of place and peoples is more reminiscent of an even earlier era, imbued as it is with racially based notions of Aborigines as lowly primitives. In the following extract he describes his visit to Darwin:
On our short excursions round Port Darwin we gained a first acquaintance with the nature and the aboriginals of Australia. Both were strange, and unlike anything else a European has ever seen. In fact, everything in this country impresses one as strange and unintelligible – as long as one is unfamiliar with the reasons for this strangeness.97
Dahl places the Aborigines firmly in a time and place far distant from his own. He searches for a context in which to situate these people – and finds the various prehistoric cultures of Europe the most relevant, as the following extracts tell:
Among living races few if any parallels will be found. Recourse must be had to finds and excavations of very distant ages in order to find a human race comparable with the Australian aboriginal. As is well known, science generally recognises two distinct races of glacial man. The one is the Neanderthal race or the Moustier Man. The other is the Cromagnon race or the Aurignac Man. ... If now we consider the aboriginals of Australia we observe that in many respects they represent as it were a type between the two primitive races of Europe.98



112 Writing Heritage
As was the case with many writers struggling to find racial affinities for the Aborigines, in Dahl’s scheme, the key to classifying Aborigines was in their stone tools. He wrote:
If we consider the stone implements of the Australian we notice great variation in the treatment of stone. We find, in fact, all variations between the coarse treatment of stone peculiar to the Neanderthaler, and the finer elaboration of flint noticeable in the implements of Cromagnon man ...99
Notwithstanding Dahl’s pejorative, race-based view of Aboriginal cultures, he did, however, note a degree of cultural diversity, as he commented on variations in Aboriginal implements between those from Arnhem Land and other parts of Australia:
Among the natives of Arnhem Land one finds only the coarse treatment of the stone. From other parts of Australia, however, I collected stone implements – spear heads – which are far more finely treated ...100
Dahl also wrote about Aboriginal art. Like many Europeans, his ideas about Aboriginal racial affinities were formed mostly on the basis of the visible manifestations of these peoples’ culture. To observers such as Dahl, the material and expressive aspects of Aboriginal culture were physical, tangible indicators of peoples’ place in the hierarchical scheme of humankind. The more rudimentary and ‘coarse’ were their tools and ‘artistic’ works, the lower they were deemed to be on the scale of progress. Maintaining his notion that Aborigines were placed somewhere between two different types of European prehistoric cultures, Dahl commented on their art:
In other respects also the Australian occupies an intermediate position. So far as we know, Neanderthal man developed no sculpture and no pictorial art, whereas the Cromagnon people were great artists. Their sculpture, and especially their rock paintings in



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 113
the Magdalen period, show the Cromagnon artists to have been clever and observant draughtsmen of a comparatively high standard. The Australian aboriginal is also a crude sculptor and paints on the rock as well, but his drawings are rougher and do not reach the high level of the drawings of the Cromagnon painter.101
This discourse on lack or absence permeates Dahl’s text, as he states that ‘The first and main fact regarding these people is the amazing simplicity of their life and of their whole apparatus of life.’102 He builds a picture of a people who, in his view, are like the animals, living close to nature, and whose entire lives are characterised by absence:
The arms and implements which they have invented are very few. They do not understand agriculture. ... Houses or permanent habitations are unknown. The earth is their bed and the heaven is their roof, as long as the dry season lasts. In the rainy season they resort to mountain caves or build a temporary shelter from bark and twigs. Free, unfettered, like herds of apes, they roam the gigantic forest of Arnhem Land.103
And again:
The weapons, implements and ornaments of these people are few, simple and primitive, and European influence has altered them very little. They still live in the stone age, and the iron of the European has not replaced stone and wood to any extent as material in their weapons.104
Depictions of Aborigines in terms of absence (lacking religion, private property, and so on) have unfortunately continued among some sectors of society up to the present time. Dahl’s visit to Arnhem Land highlights the increasing popularity of that northern region for researchers, collectors, and visitors of many kinds. Another visitor was the explorer Sir Hubert Wilkins, who led an expedition to Queensland and the Northern Territory



114 Writing Heritage
during 1923–25 to collect natural history specimens for the British Museum, and whose account of that expedition was published in 1929. In the first years of his expedition, while travelling through north-west Queensland, Wilkins noted some images in caves. Like many writers, Wilkins pondered the meaning of these images, as he wrote ‘in the dim light of the caves these white hands outlined with blood-red colour resembled ghostly apparitions, and it is difficult to determine their meaning or significance, if there is any such attached to them’. As well as speculating on the ‘lost meanings’ of the images, Wilkins was also concerned with erosion and the need for preservation:
The natives in the district at present have no knowledge of the meaning of the hands or of the other signs, and it may be that these stencillings are merely the meaningless work of natives using the caves when decorating themselves for some ceremonial performance. In any case, the significance of these markings will be lost entirely if facts about them are not soon collected, for the sandstone surfaces are weathering fast and the markings will disappear within a few years. Already a number of imprints have been destroyed.105
Like many others who wrote of Aboriginal rock markings, Wilkins portrayed these images and designs as if they were disconnected from the people who had produced them. His narrative suggests that these rock images had more meaning as objects of Europeans’ curiosity, and for scientific study, than they might have as expressions of Aboriginal cultural heritage. He described one such ‘slab’ of rock:
One long slab is so covered with signs and symbols that it has the appearance of some ancient attempt at writing, but the aborigines now living in the vicinity have no idea as to the meaning of the signs.106



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 115
In contrast to some earlier writers who thought that Aborigines had no knowledge of rock markings, Wilkins seemed to recognise topographical features as having more significance to the Aboriginal people in a given area. His narrative of his visit to Goulburn Island, near King River Range, suggests that he had an awareness of the connection between these sites, Aboriginal belief, and importantly, place:
... Just beyond this range there rises a peculiarly isolated peak known to white men as Torr Rock. To those geologically informed it is just a hard rocky knob of igneous matter which has withstood the wear and tear of the elements while the surrounding earth has been worn away by water action, but to the native the rock has a far greater significance. Its face is carved with fantastic designs, and on the roofs and ledges are drawings of hands and arms and of many animals found in the neighbourhood. The rock itself is said by some natives to be the remains of a giant spirit which roamed the earth in early days and was changed to rock for the benefit of the black man, for, as the rock rises above the surrounding plain, it is a haven of refuge from the mosquitoes during the wet season.107
Wilkins also visited Groote Eylandt, where he ‘traded tobacco for stone spears and woomerahs’, these items forming the basis for an ethnographic collection for the British Museum.108 The narratives of Wilkins and Dahl illustrate the kinds of writing that might be described as ‘explorer narratives’, produced as a result of transient visits across broad areas of the country. The purpose of these writings differed from that of detailed ethnographies such as those of Spencer and Gillen. The explorer narratives sought to reach a wider, more popular audience, and to engage that audience with tales of heroism, adventure and the lure of the exotic. By contrast, the more ethnographically oriented works endeavoured to inform more than entertain, providing a more specialised readership with a ‘study’ of a particular Aboriginal society or group of societies, based on the presumed authority and expertise of the writer.



116 Writing Heritage
Berndt and Berndt have outlined a history of Australian Aboriginal studies in which they refer to several successive phases of study, beginning with an ‘elementary’ phase, comprising travellers’ accounts produced from the seventeenth century to the midnineteenth century. This was followed by a ‘formative’ phase, in which many of the nineteenth-century missionary works were written. A ‘constructive’ phase came next, during which many of the major studies were carried out by people such as Howitt, Mathews, Roth, and Spencer and Gillen. Dahl’s writings, in the Berndts’ scheme, also belong to this period, as do those of Basedow, Mountford and Tindale. The Berndts define a ‘professional’ phase, beginning with Elkin in the mid-1920s. This period encompasses workers such as Stanner, Warner, McConnel, Kaberry, McCarthy, Davidson, and the Berndts’ own work.109
Fieldwork, research and publication: the growth in knowledge
Throughout the decades of the 1920s and 1930s there was a steady accumulation in knowledge of Aboriginal societies and cultures, including details of their art, material culture and other elements of cultural heritage. A regular stream of researchers contributed to this growth in knowledge, visiting Arnhem Land and other parts of the Northern Territory and ‘remote’ Australia to conduct fieldwork in anthropology, archaeology and related disciplines. Norman Tindale, an ethnologist at the South Australian Museum, visited Groote Eylandt during 1920–21. Lloyd Warner, an American anthropologist, carried out fieldwork in several localities within Arnhem Land in 1926, and again in 1929, and published his major work some years later in 1937. Spencer and Gillen published yet more works, with their book on the Central Australian peoples, whom they termed the ‘Arunta’, appearing in 1927, and Spencer’s Wanderings in Wild Australia, a more reflective narrative of his years



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 117
in the Northern Territory, published in 1928. A third edition of Spencer’s guide to ethnological collections in the Melbourne museum was also issued in 1928. Spencer and Gillen’s work, in contrast to that of earlier people such as Aiston, Mitchell, Towle and Kenyon, was conducted in a much more systematic way. From the mid- to late 1920s, Aboriginal studies (especially anthropology) established a professional foundation and, conducted in more rigorous and intensive ways, was supported by universities and museums. The work of people such as Tindale, Warner, Elkin, McConnel, Thomson, Stanner and others during the 1920s to 1940s formed an important core of research.110 Norman Tindale, ethnologist with the South Australian Museum, was active in researching and writing on Aboriginal culture, and participated in expeditions to many parts of South Australia, Central Australia and the Northern Territory. In 1925 he published an account of his visit during 1921–22 to the Northern Territory’s Groote Eylandt and the Gulf of Carpentaria.111 In Tindale’s description of wet season huts used by Groote Eylandt Aborigines, he wrote that ‘the smooth bark walls of the hut in course of time become covered with sketches, drawings and painted designs executed during the idle hours of the day’. He observed that ‘the wet season is a time of industry. Many spears are made, weapons, baskets, and ornaments are painted, and ceremonial objects are prepared’. Not only were bark huts used for creative activities, but so too were other temporary shelters used during the wet season, and Tindale noted that ‘the walls of these caves are also covered with pictures’.112 This description conveys a sense that the Aborigines had a casual approach to creating designs, where these are produced in the course of sheltering from the elements. Tindale also collected some paintings from Groote Eylandt during his visit there. In 1924 Tindale visited the Flinders Ranges in South Australia, accompanied by the South Australian Museum’s Herbert Hale, and an account of that visit was published in 1925.113 In this work, Hale



118 Writing Heritage
and Tindale indicate the way they obtained information from the Aborigines:
Aborigines were encamped in the vicinity, and we had many interesting conversations with the older natives. The younger generation evince little or no interest in the customs and handiwork of their ancestors, and, indeed, know very little concerning them. Even the older aborigines have been in more or less intermittent contact with the white man all their lives, and only meagre details of the old-time customs of their tribe may be gleaned from them.114
In this extract there is once again an evocation of a ‘disappearing’ culture. Hale and Tindale’s comment provides an important perspective on early approaches to fieldwork, and foreshadows later debates about the nature of Europeans’ fieldwork practice and work with Aboriginal people. Here there is a sense of heritage as a living tradition, where knowledge transmitted through the generations is gradually being lost with the encroachment of Europeans.
The beginning of systematic archaeological excavation
The increasing pace of fieldwork and research during the 1920s did not only focus on Aboriginal social organisation, art and material culture. Another discipline that came to prominence during this decade, and which was to have a profound influence on European notions of Indigenous heritage, was that of archaeology. While the continuing work of amateur collectors and ethnologists, and their proliferating writings, created a firm discourse on questions of antiquity, origins, and classification of Australia’s human occupants and the material products of their cultures, others were providing the beginnings of a more rigorous discipline of archaeology. South Australians Hale and Tindale were among these latter, and they conducted the first full-scale controlled excavation in 1929. This excavation, at a rock shelter called Devon Downs in South Australia,



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 119
established an important beginning for a discipline founded on systematic excavation. Devon Downs was to become a reference point for future archaeological work, and for debates about culture sequences and periodisation in Australian archaeology. The prominence of the Devon Downs work led one writer to question the extent to which one excavation should determine all future theories on archaeological ‘periods’. Fred McCarthy, curator of anthropology at the Australian Museum in Sydney, wrote in 1962:
It is, however, in the description of our prehistoric cultures that the most serious differences of opinion exist, and here it has become largely a matter of whether or not the basic archaeological periods of Australia can be decided upon one excavation, that of Hale and Tindale (1930) on the lower Murray river in South Australia.115
McCarthy had a particular interest in periodisation in Australian archaeology. By delineating periods and successive ‘cultures’ or ‘sequences’ of Aboriginal occupation and cultural production, McCarthy and others – such as Norman Tindale, John Mulvaney, Harry Allen and Rhys Jones – constructed a ‘prehistory’ of Aborigines.116 Debates in later years over Aboriginal heritage, cultural property and sacred sites highlighted the contested nature of ‘prehistory’. Like heritage, pre-history was eventually to be regarded by some as not merely another academic discipline, or an artifact of the European imagination, but an important element of Aboriginal peoples’ own cultural heritage.117
‘Increasingly difficult to obtain specimens’: preserving and collecting
The intensification of fieldwork, the continued activities of collectors, the increasing administrative and bureaucratic controls over Aboriginal people, and the growing pressures of settlement and resulting disruption of Aboriginal peoples’ lives all combined to



120 Writing Heritage
create a heightened sense of urgency to record, document and ‘preserve’ the vestiges of Aboriginal culture. This led to increasing calls for collections of Aboriginal and other (e.g., Melanesian) cultural materials to be established, and for some kind of centralised, or ‘national’ collection. Among the early advocates for a national collection was the noted anthropologist A. R. Radcliffe Brown, who held the first Chair in Anthropology at the then newly established department in Sydney University. In 1927 Radcliffe Brown wrote in a memorandum to the Prime Minister’s Department:
Australia has a number of ethnological collections, one in each of the capital cities, and some of them are extensive and important. But there is certainly room, in addition, for a national collection in the Federal Capital of Canberra. The first purpose of such a museum would be to preserve, study and exhibit objects illustrating the mode of life and manners and customs of the aboriginal regions – New Guinea, Melanesia, Polynesia, etc. ... If such an ethnological museum is ever to be established at all some steps must be taken immediately. Every year it becomes increasingly difficult to obtain specimens illustrating the life and cultures of the Australasian peoples. The native people themselves are dying out or are ceasing to make or use the things they formerly had. Moreover there is at the present time a very great demand for such specimens in Europe and America, so that any which are available quickly find their way to museums in those continents. Every delay, therefore, will add considerably to the difficulty and cost of making such a representative collection.118
Here the anthropologist gives a firm and authoritative voice to the notion that the Aborigines were ‘dying out’, and uses this as a pretext for the need to preserve the material remains of their societies. This idea of ‘saving’ the culture through their material products would continue to course through European discourses for a considerable period of time.



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 121
Collecting the sacred: the tjurunga
With Europeans’ interest in Aboriginal culture growing at a rapid rate, the flow of objects taken from Aboriginal societies also increased as a consequence. It was not only stone tools, wooden spears, boomerangs and bark paintings that were increasingly filling the museums, universities and drawing rooms of Europeans. Among the types of objects desired and collected by the intruders were the special class of object known as tjurungas, or ‘churinga’ to writers of earlier decades. However, unlike most stone ‘tools’, and many of the other kinds of objects, these tjurungas were seemingly acknowledged by many Europeans as having very particular and culturally significant associations to the Aborigines. The sacred qualities of tjurungas set them apart from other, more mundane objects, and placed them in a special category of collectable items. Europeans had long been aware that Aboriginal people had a spiritual life, and some early writers documented this aspect of Aboriginal society. However, Europeans often did not regard the Aborigines’ spiritual life as having the same attributes or status as ‘religion’. But many writers and observers nonetheless knew that this non-material aspect was an important dimension to Aboriginal society; for example, they understood this within the context of prevailing interests in what was termed ‘totemism’. Since at least the last century the subject of totemism had been of particular interest to Europeans – an interest that was facilitated in part by its having been taken up by some of the leading European intellectuals, such as Tylor, Frazer, Durkheim and Freud. The ethnographic works of Spencer and Gillen had played an important role in making these Europeans aware of the religious ideas of the Aborigines. Despite these early indicators of a nascent sense in Europeans’ writings of the deeper complexities of Aboriginal spiritual and sacred life, the important connections between objects and the sacred in Aboriginal societies were not readily understood or acknowledged



122 Writing Heritage
for a very long time. The tjurungas that were coming increasingly to the attention of Europeans were regarded by many as simply another type of object to be acquired and added to ethnology collections, or traded on the artifact market.119 This allure of tjuringas to Europeans was powerfully illustrated by the way members of the 1894 Horn Expedition had stolen tjurungas from their secret cave. However, over time the tjurungas became a locus in Europeans’ writings for the interplay of tensions between the desire among these writers to collect, display and ‘preserve’ Aboriginal material objects, and a slowly growing appreciation by some Europeans of the significance that such objects had for the Aboriginal people themselves. This tension is illustrated in the following letters written by Kenyon in 1927, in which he expresses outrage at the apparent ‘theft’ of some tjurungas from Oodnadatta. Kenyon wrote to Radcliffe Brown:
Dear Professor You may have heard or read that the recent ‘Reso’ train from Victoria to Central Australia was responsible for the raiding of one of the sacred depositories of the Arunta Churingas. Whether directly or vicariously is uncertain as the accounts of those concerned vary much. Archbishop Lees (Anglican) and John Mathew for the Presbyterian Church, have written strong letters to the paper to induce the culprit to return them, but so far without success. The Federal Government would have intervened but as the transaction is alleged to have taken place in South Australia and out of the Territory it is powerless. And that is why I am writing this. ...120
Here Kenyon raises a concern about lack of Commonwealth control over Aboriginal matters, including the regulation of illegal acquisition, and traffic in cultural objects. His comments presage later debates about the nature and limitations of legislative proposals for protection of Indigenous heritage. Kenyon also wrote to A. C. Haddon about the theft of the Oodnadatta ‘churingas’:



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 123
This month a ‘Reso’ – that is a special train, sleepers, dining car, etc. – containing about 80 tourists, the objective being the inspection of the resources of Australia – tour was made from Melbourne via Adelaide to Oodnadatta and cars thence to Alice Springs and Barrows Creek. One of its members either rifled or induced the rifling of a sacred deposit of Arunta Churingas. It got into the papers, and there was a great outcry. The Archbishop of Melbourne urges their immediate return. The Roman Catholic and Presbyterian heads back him up. The Museum Trustees refuse to receive them. The Federal Government has no jurisdiction, nor apparently any of the States. Probably the individual will see the error of his ways and restitute.121
Kenyon’s writing highlights several key issues that were to become increasingly prominent over the following decades. His references to the lack of power by the Commonwealth to act to redress the ‘theft’ raises the question of jurisdictional responsibility for Aboriginal people. The only areas in which the Commonwealth, at this time, was able to provide for Aboriginal people were in those parts that were Commonwealth territory – that is, the Northern Territory. This problem of relations between the Commonwealth and the States regarding control over Indigenous heritage was – and remains – a vexed one. Another aspect of Kenyon’s letters invites attention. He urges his respondents to take action to ‘return’ the ‘churingas’. We might assume he meant their return to the place from which they were taken – described here as a ‘sacred deposit’. This notion of the return of sacred objects (or indeed of any cultural objects) was unusual for this time, since the more typical pre-occupation for Europeans – as will be seen – was to remove cultural objects from their sources (i.e., communities, former campsites, middens, etc), and to place them in collections and public exhibitions. Kenyon and others expressed outrage at what they saw as theft, or acts of sacrilege directed against Aboriginal culture.122 However, there were Euro



124 Writing Heritage
peans who held different views. L. Keith Ward, government geologist in South Australia, argued that the tjurungas in question were no longer ‘in use’, as they had come from sites long abandoned by Aborigines. Writing to Kenyon, Ward explained:
Regarding the ‘sacrilegious act’ a few words: the churingas were found in situ, from what I hear, in the vicinity of Oodnadatta, where, so far as I have been able to ascertain, they have not been in use for ceremonial purposes for very many years, since no corroborees have been held there, and very few blacks indeed remain. I am in entire agreement with those who regard the despoiling of a hiding place of the churingas now in use as nothing less than sacrilege. ... but I do not think the case is the same where the old culture has gone permanently.123
Ward thought it ‘better that the Churingas should then pass into the custody of permanent trustees such as the Museums’.124 He also explained his view on keeping tjurungas, from sites thought to be abandoned, in museum collections, as he wrote:
I personally have one churinga that comes from a totem centre in Central Australia and I know that the centre has been abandoned for over 25 years. I have been there and know that the old sanctuary is despoiled and defiled, and feel no compunction about holding a churinga once associated with that place.
His argument for entrusting these objects to museums was made in what he saw as the interests of preservation, as he explained to Kenyon:
There are many churingas in the National Museum in Melbourne and in our Adelaide museum which came from localities that have been abandoned as centres of ceremonial observance for a less time than Oodnadatta. Should these Churingas be returned? I think not. If they are put back, no effort will be spared by some persons to rob the treasure; and the set will be removed for private collections and lost for purposes of record.125



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 125
Kenyon continued to argue that the tjurungas in question were ‘alive’, as he pointed out to Ward:
Re: the Churingas, I think you are misinformed re the matter. If found where stated, then they must have been very much ‘alive’ ... As to ‘dead’ Churingas, I have a dozen or more, our Museum say a hundred or two, and yours about a thousand, some at least of which are the usual Mission Station fakes. The whole point to my mind is that the stones were wrapped and greased.126
Despite Kenyon’s concerns about the irresponsible taking of tjurungas, he was clearly proud of his collection of these objects, notwithstanding his disdain for those who would acquire such ‘live’ ones. As one who had long advocated the need for legislative control over collecting, Kenyon concluded that ‘what is needed at the present time is one control, and that must be the Commonwealth Government’.127 This debate about whether the tjurungas were still ‘in use’ is underpinned by a number of assumptions concerning preservation, and views about ‘living’ cultures. One assumption was that cultural objects no longer used by Aborigines, or found in places thought to be no longer occupied, visited or used by Aborigines, were not therefore part of a ‘living’ Aboriginal culture. This assumption was the basis upon which Europeans could ‘justify’ their obtaining such objects and placing them in collections for scientific and ethnographic study and display. Another assumption informing the Ward–Kenyon discussion concerns Europeans’ interests in collecting, recording and documenting Aboriginal culture as an object for the study and contemplation of European science, natural history and ethnology, rather than as a part of Aboriginal peoples’ own cultural heritage. Also threading through Ward and Kenyon’s correspondence is a separate theme that was to assume increased prominence in coming decades: the tensions between private and



126 Writing Heritage
public (e.g., museum) collections, and questions regarding government regulation of collecting.
From ethnology to art: the 1929 exhibition
European-Australian collectors and others generally regarded objects of heritage – such as stone tools and other implements, and sacred objects – as ethnological specimens. However, by the late 1920s a transformation was emerging in the way Europeans regarded certain elements of Aboriginal culture and heritage. The designs and images that the intruders and visitors had for so long admired, or simply contemplated on rock and cave walls, on stone and wood, and on slabs of bark, were by now assuming the status of something other than that of ethnological curiosity or scientific specimen. There was a growing interest in these designs and images as ‘art’. In 1929 many of these designs and images were brought together for an exhibition at Melbourne’s National Museum. Accompanying this exhibition was a catalogue with text by Charles Barrett and A. S. Kenyon, which espoused the virtues of this hitherto little known area of what the authors called ‘primitive art’.128 Charles Barrett was a Melbourne-based naturalist, collector and writer. In his contribution, ‘The Primitive Artist’, he began with the following summary:
Australia has been neglected by students of primitive art, who have devoted many years to the cultures of ‘Stone Age’ peoples. In Europe and America ethnologists certainly have ample material for their studies, but some, at least, have failed to realize the importance of our aboriginal art, if only for purposes of comparison.129 All that we know yet of aboriginal art in Australia is dominated by cave and rock-shelter pictures. More elaborate is the art of their finest decorations, on weapons and sacred objects, of wood or of stone; and of those wonderful ground drawings, before which I have seen the old men of a tribe crooning earnestly.130



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 127
The art of our forerunners in Australia, from the red hands on cave walls to the painted shields of Queensland, is illustrated in a unique exhibition, whose purpose is clear. We should have more interest in the Australian race; learn its culture, which ranks with that of other ‘Stone Age’ peoples, who survive like living fossils, but are failing. Every relic of the aboriginals is worth preserving; and the caves and shelters, where they painted and carved, should be guarded as national possessions.131
Barrett uses familiar language, extolling his readers to preserve the designs and images on cave walls, rock surfaces and decorated shields as the relics of a disappearing ‘Stone Age’ culture. His call to safeguard these things as ‘national possessions’, which was expressed with increasing frequency in Europeans’ writings, illustrates another transition in writers’ views on Aboriginal cultural heritage. Where many writers had regarded the aspects of Aboriginal heritage that they saw, recorded and collected as ‘specimens’ or ‘relics’ for scientific study and display in museums, there was an emerging sense that this heritage was something more than items of scientific interest. It was coming to be considered a part of the nation, as in Barrett’s reference to ‘national possessions’. Kenyon, too, wrote of this Aboriginal ‘art’ as a subject requiring attention beyond that of anthropology. His paper, entitled ‘The art of the Australian Aboriginal’, proclaimed:
The subject of Aboriginal Art – in this case the Art of the Australian Aboriginal – has to be approached with the utmost caution, for, though it comes directly within the domain of anthropology, it is in an indirect way a very important question in psychology and pedagogics.132 We possess some knowledge of our own mentality through the kind offices of psychology; but though we have some – many in certain classes – material relics of our primitive and prehistoric ancestor, the only evidence of evolution of thought and of the development of his powers of abstract conception must be derived



128 Writing Heritage
from his art remains, his pictographs, sculptures, and adornments. Hence the dominating importance of such relics and the pressing need for very cautious treading by the mere anthropologist.133
Here Kenyon valued this Aboriginal art as a way of educating the viewing public about Aboriginal culture. Thus, not unlike the stone tools that had so preoccupied many writers, Aboriginal art could be a key to understanding the Aborigines – as ‘evidence’ of their progress on the scale of evolution.
The institutionalisation of anthropology
By the late 1920s the activities of amateur collectors and writers on Aboriginal culture heritage began to be increasingly circumscribed by the growth of professionalism in anthropology, archaeology and Aboriginal studies. The museums and universities had long held particular interests in Aboriginal studies, especially in ethnological and anthropological studies. Science and natural history studies also commonly incorporated some reference to Aboriginal culture and heritage. The establishment in 1926 of the first professional university department of anthropology at Sydney University was an important development. The occupant of the Chair of Anthropology at Sydney University came to play a major role in influencing the direction of all matters regarding Aboriginal affairs.134 By this time there were already some well-established non-professional anthropological societies, which played an important role in the formation of a consciousness about Indigenous heritage in the European mind.135 One of the implications of the establishment of the anthropology department at Sydney University was that it highlighted the differences between social anthropology and ethnology in Australia. The discipline of social anthropology, with its emphasis on social and political organisation and kinship, became increasingly professional, and was now, according to one view, ‘primarily the domain of the



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 129
academic world’. In contrast, the study of material culture was ‘relegated to a peripheral position’.136 The tension between those who studied social anthropology and those more concerned with material culture was often played out in the personal writings of some of those involved. Nonetheless, the work of ‘non-professionals’ in collecting, identifying and classifying material culture continued unabated, and many of these people were keen participants in the various societies, associations and other bodies involved in anthropology, archaeology and natural history. The continued activities of collecting, recording and documenting Aboriginal cultural heritage began, at least for some participants, to acquire an increasingly interventionist dimension. Where from early times Europeans’ activities involving Aboriginal cultural expressions and objects were predominantly remote and distanced, over the decades they came to be more concerned with the production, and also with the ‘use’ of Aboriginal culture. In this sense, Europeans did not always simply collect, document and record culture passively ‘as they saw it’; they were now more often instrumental in the production of the culture that they recorded. Indeed, the intruders would, in many instances, intentionally intervene in the ongoing life of a community, with the specific purpose of obtaining a record or ‘sample’ of that community. This intervention might involve ‘commissioning’ bark paintings (as with Spencer at Oenpelli), requesting Aborigines to make certain specific kinds of objects on demand, or facilitating, with gifts of tobacco, knives and other goods, the staging of a performance of dance or ceremony.
Influence, copying or innovation? Margaret Preston and Aboriginal art
Europeans’ fascination for Aboriginal art and material culture did not only manifest itself through collecting, recording, documenting



130 Writing Heritage
and classifying cultural objects and expressions. Europeans also continued to intervene – either by intent or implicitly – in the creative processes of Aboriginal people in many and varied ways. Some sought to incorporate Aboriginal artistic designs into their own practice, and advocated that others follow their example. Others again, fascinated by the ways in which Aboriginal people produced art and cultural objects, became involved in the processes of Aboriginal peoples’ adaptation to new forms of creative and cultural expression. In a sense, this use of Aboriginal designs in European art was yet another kind of ‘collecting’ and ‘recording’ of Aboriginal heritage. But here, the Aboriginal designs are less clearly discernible as they became integrated into the European object or image. Indigenous art and culture had, by the 1920s, long exerted a strong influence on the western imagination. At around this time the growing interest in Aboriginal art as fine art, rather than as ethnographic curiosity, was also gaining ground. This interest was facilitated by the success of Namatjira and other Hermannsburg Aboriginal artists, as well as by the accessibility of writings by people such as Fred McCarthy, Charles Mountford and A. P. Elkin. One person whose work reflected the influences of Aboriginal art was the artist Margaret Preston. Working between the wars, Preston, who was born in 1894, was known for her campaign for the development of an Australian national art based on Aboriginal forms. In many of her writings from the 1920s to the 1940s she drew attention to the varieties of Aboriginal design and urged others to turn to these for inspiration. In 1924 Preston wrote:
... Australia must honestly confess to having no designs of her own. Taking native flowers, etc., of any country and twiddling them into unique forms will never give a national decorative art. The need then to try and base our designs on other foundations is obvious. A study of our own aboriginal art may meet with better success. Other countries have not been above profiting by close observation of primitive or foreign races. Many designs for curtains, floorings,



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 131
etc., are inspired from such sources. Australia could be influenced to its own advantage in the same way.137
This sentiment, if viewed from the perspective of today, when there is much debate and discussion about the exploitation of Aboriginal art and designs, strikes the reader as a clear instance of the promotion of such exploitation. However, to Preston, the use of Aboriginal designs as inspiration for a ‘national decorative art’ was seen not as exploitation, but as a genuine attempt to develop a truly ‘Australian’ art. One critic has suggested though that Preston’s ‘championing of Aboriginal art’:
... was accompanied by a virulent artistic colonialism, which advocated the adoption of Aboriginal methods and ways of seeing but at the same time, denied the culture that gave them meaning.138
Before further exploring the ways in which Europeans ‘created’ the culture they collected and recorded, I will consider one particular means of recording culture: the use of photography. As a powerful tool in the recording of culture, photography was an essential part of much fieldwork. Spencer and Gillen’s work was well known for its use of photography in producing a visual document of every aspect of the societies observed. A lesser known photographer was B. L. Hornshaw.
Recording rock art: Hornshaw’s work
The markings that Europeans saw on rock surfaces, on the walls of caves, and on bark slabs were to them often strange and enigmatic, and equally as compelling as stone tools, weapons and bark paintings. These markings differed from objects in at least one important respect: they were generally not portable. Unlike the objects, which could be carried, stored and transported often over vast distances, markings on rock were fixed. They could only be observed, studied



132 Writing Heritage
and recorded in situ – thus necessitating their observers to make journeys to see them. Not only did rock markings in ‘remote’ regions such as the Kimberley in Western Australia invite Europeans’ attention, so too did markings found in and around closely settled and urban areas. Many such markings were found in the Sydney region and other parts of New South Wales. These had been noted by some of the first European visitors to Australia,139 and continued to fascinate many observers. One person intrigued by these markings was Bernard Leslie Hornshaw, a tramways worker from Sydney. Hornshaw was one of those people – like Stan Mitchell, Charles Barrett and many others who dedicated their ‘spare’ time to the collection and documenting of Aboriginal art and artifacts. In contrast to professionally trained workers such as Elkin, Warner, Stanner, and McCarthy, Hornshaw approached the recording of Aboriginal cultural heritage in a style reminiscent of the explorers of a previous century. Like many of these amateur ethnologists, Hornshaw adopted a tone of awe and wonder at what he saw and recorded. His tone is more that of a popular adventure narrator than of a scholar. His depiction of ‘wild tribes’ no longer in existence, and their ‘strange beliefs and customs’, is in marked contrast to that of more rigorous writers such as Basedow. He introduced his readers to these rock markings in the following way:
Although we have no wild tribes in New South Wales today, a fact which, from an anthropological point of view, is greatly to be deplored, there are still to be found a great number of interesting records of their strange beliefs and customs. These, if the key to their meaning could be found, would unravel the mystery of many of their primitive ceremonies. I refer to aboriginal art, and believe that nothing stimulates the mind more than the study of these interesting relics of the past.140



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 133
In Hornshaw’s view, the Aborigines whom he denoted as ‘wild tribes’ no longer existed. Instead, all that remained were their traces, the ‘interesting records of their strange beliefs and customs’ or ‘interesting relics of the past’. The writer describes the images in the ‘many crude “art galleries”’ that he found during his ‘wanderings through the bush’. He lists the various types of rock and tree markings, and compares certain of these with those found in other parts of the world:
Red hands, which are fairly common in this country, have their similarities in other parts of the world, and resemble some of the paintings and drawings found in the caves of France and Spain, and are worthy of comparison with the pictographs so well portrayed by the bushmen of South Africa. In the delineation of the tracks of animals and birds, the dusky artist excelled, for they are true in every essential detail.141
This extract once again presents a discourse on resemblance, a theme that re-emerges in many writings. Here, the quality of the ‘red hands’ drawn by the ‘dusky artist’ of Australia is considered equal to that of the European palaeolithic people and to those of South African bushmen. Hornshaw regards likeness to ‘real’ images of fauna an indicator of artistic ‘excellence’. He continues:
It is doubtful if the meaning of native art in this country will ever be discovered, but its abundance seems to prove that it is intentionally a record, and not the work of idle hands as some anthropologists claim. When we consider what a small amount of labour the Aborigine devoted to his habitations, clothing, ornaments and cooking utensils, it is surprising how much time he has given to art.142
So apparently vast was Hornshaw’s knowledge of New South Wales rock art sites that, mourning his death in October 1937, one newspaper eulogised Hornshaw claiming that ‘he knew more about this form of primitive art than any other amateur student’.143



134 Writing Heritage
The Melbourne collector and writer Charles Barrett paid homage to Hornshaw’s work in his contribution to the 1943 work Art of the Australian Aboriginal that he edited with fellow collector Robert Henderson Croll.144 Barrett describes Hornshaw’s work:
Student as well as recorder, Hornshaw devoted the leisure hours of half a lifetime to aboriginal art, as represented in the Hawkesbury sandstone region. Becoming interested as a young man, when he noticed petroglyphs during his bush rambles, he decided to make a scientific record of all the groups he could find. Very soon, the majority of the well-known groups within a short distance of Sydney had been visited, and scores of others located in French’s Forest, at Bantry Bay, and elsewhere. Then the amateur ethnologist went further afield.145
Barrett says Hornshaw was ‘astonished at the abundance of rock carvings in his ever widening territory’.146 Barrett wrote further of Hornshaw’s work:
The Hawkesbury sandstone, with its rock shelter walls and great flat or gently sloping rocks, offered a ‘canvas’ to the aboriginal wherever he roamed. Hundreds of human and animal figures, symbols, and imaginary objects carved in the sandstone, were photographed and measured, each photograph being accompanied by valuable data. Hornshaw’s enthusiasm never waned, though his good work seldom received due recognition.147
Although writings by Hornshaw are scant, he did leave a considerable photographic record of the rock carvings that fascinated him. Barrett tells us that Hornshaw ‘took nearly one thousand photographs of rock carvings, and filled many notebooks with details of different groups’, and that ‘no such record of primitive art perhaps has been made by one man in any other country’.148 Barrett continues:



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 135
Most generous with his own knowledge and photographs, he kept none of his ‘finds’ secret from those who, like the present writer, were eager to visit the groups. Often enough he guided us to them and helped in photography and measuring. The contents of his notebooks, when published, will add greatly to our knowledge of the petroglyphs of eastern New South Wales. This unassuming man, with a true scientific outlook and a deep love of aboriginal art, formed definite theories concerning the meaning of many of the rock carvings which are associated with sacred ceremonies. He held that the aborigines were not without some religious ideas; that they believed in some form of Great Spirit or deity. He advocated that every effort should be made to preserve rock carvings and pictographs, and, with others, he was instrumental in getting something done in this direction.149
Here we are presented with a picture of Hornshaw as a kind of lone ‘saviour’ for the rock art, busily tramping the New South Wales countryside photographing and recording these sites. Hornshaw, like many of those individuals who collected, recorded and displayed Aboriginal art and culture, had a kind of ‘museum’ approach to this work, carrying out his no doubt well-intentioned studies in a remote, distant way, apparently devoid of any sense of Aboriginal peoples’ connections with the rock art. The legacy of his work, a substantial photographic record of these rock art sites, is however available to the public, as it resides in the archives of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies in Canberra. As well as its role in documenting engraving and art sites, the use of photography was also seminal in recording ceremonial and other kinds of performances.
Recording performance: Aiston’s corroboree
One aspect of Aboriginal life that was of enduring fascination to Europeans was the performance widely known as the ‘corroboree’.



136 Writing Heritage
This expression of Indigenous culture was often deliberately sought (or constructed) by European observers and fieldworkers in their enthusiasm to establish some kind of record of the culture. Very often, too, corroborees were ‘staged’ by Aborigines as a specific form of response to Europeans, or organised in collusion with the visitors.150 This notion of corroborees as spectacle for the gaze of Europeans has already been discussed in the context of Frank Gillen’s remarks in 1901 about photographing such a performance. Similar issues are prominent in the following comments about corroborees made by George Aiston in 1931 to Robert Henderson Croll, the Melbourne-based collector, art critic and naturalist:
Dear Mr Croll I hardly know what to say about the possibility of getting a record of a corroboree, the blacks are like wild dogs here today and gone tomorrow. It might be possible, I have spoken to some of the more civilized and they are agreeable as far as they are concerned but of course they cannot vouch for the others and the bush blacks are a totally unknown quantity, they have no interest what ever in the white man, his goods or his works, at present they are all still scattering again, a mob of about a dozen came here last evening, some of them are going south and some north, they expect to meet here again in about a fortnight, but it is quite probable they will not meet for months. They are so totally unreliable. If a party could be here when they were assembled they would be delighted to give every assistance but the trouble would be in mustering them, but I will write more later.151
This letter seems somewhat at odds with Aiston’s correspondence on stone tools examined above. Unlike the stone tool correspondence, this letter conveys a pejorative view of Aborigines. Aiston’s reference to them as ‘like wild dogs’, and his insistence on their unreliability construct a powerful image of the crude, ‘uncivilised’ savage. Employing this harsh racialised language, Aiston’s remark that the Aborigines ‘have no interest what ever in the white man, his goods



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 137
or his works’ reinforces his stereotype of a brute savage uncaring of the benefits of ‘civilised’ man and ‘his works’. Aiston persisted in trying to obtain a ‘record of a corroboree’, whereby the Aborigines would perform for the European observers ‘on demand’. He wrote again to Croll:
... I have had quite a mob of blacks here lately, they are all shifting about, yesterday I suppose that at least 50 were in the camp, to-day they are down to about 20, I gave rations to that many this morning. Dr Horne had the luck to bump into a big corroboree at Mungeranie, but one may never have the luck to strike a lot like that again. They are so unreliable, I could get enough at any time to make a show like some of those I saw at Canberra (of American Indians performing some of their ceremonial dances) but I doubt if it would be possible to get a genuine show, for one thing the corroboree takes up so much room, anything up to a mile of country is needed for the various parts of the ceremony, and most of the important things are at night, during the day the performers are out hunting, only the few privileged old men stay in camp and instruct the initiates. At every corroboree there are some who get advanced a degree or so, a performance that a boy or young man of this year would be excluded from (although he had been made a young man) would possibly be open to him next year. This goes on until the man has been admitted to the final old man’s dance when he becomes a Pinnaru and after that he has the freedom of all dances, even of the secret women’s dance. This is usually kept exclusive by a picket of women and lord help the man who tries to get through the line of sentries. I saw part of this once on the Frome River, but I could not get nearer than about a hundred yards, and only then because the old gin who was guarding that part was a tribal sister of mine, but she got frightened after a bit and begged me to go.152
Here Aiston has, it seems, at last succeeded in observing a women’s secret corroboree. This letter suggests the way Aboriginal culture was staged or choreographed by Europeans, apparently to satisfy the



138 Writing Heritage
curious gaze of the observer and recorder. This staged performance may well have also been an intentional strategy by the Aborigines to engage with Europeans. Aiston’s writing further highlights the continuing anxieties that Europeans had regarding ‘authenticity’. In this letter Aiston is confident that he could ‘get enough [Aboriginal people] at any time to make a show’, but doubts that such a ‘show’ would be ‘genuine’. There is a presumption here about what, in his view, might constitute ‘genuine’. It is at this point that he then launches into a polemic about the extent of ‘room’ that would be needed for such a ‘genuine’ performance, and concerns that these performances are usually conducted at night. He considered these factors as constraints to the possibility of organising a ‘genuine’ performance for the Europeans’ consumption. Aiston’s remarks about the corroboree needing ‘so much room’, and that ‘most of the important things are at night’, again illustrate, as we saw earlier with Gillen’s comment on photographing a performance, the ways in which many Europeans could only ‘see’ Aboriginal culture within their own frames of space and time. Aiston’s classification of ‘more civilised’ versus ‘wild blacks’ also reifies the kind of evolutionary discourse that continued to inform much writing by Europeans at this time. A growing consciousness by Europeans of the many facets of Indigenous heritage was, by the 1930s, profoundly influenced by the growth of the discipline of archaeology. While Aborigines were objects for the photographers’ gaze, their relationship to the practice of archaeology was equally complex, and occasionally (especially in later decades) fraught. One archaeologist who articulated some of these issues at this time was American Daniel Sutherland Davidson.
Davidson and archaeology
In 1935 Davidson published an article, Archaeological Problems of Northern Australia, based on his brief ‘archaeological reconnaissance’



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 139
in the Katherine River and Victoria River region of North Australia carried out while a Visiting Fellow from the University of Pennsylvania.153 Davidson wrote that ‘the presence of the natives was found to be of great value in archaeological work’, as he explained:
Various tribesmen rendered invaluable assistance in their willingness to point out caves and other sites of aboriginal occupation and in their knowledge of the artifacts excavated. As a result of their identification of various objects, light was thrown upon a number of points of interest which might otherwise have been left unanswered. It is interesting to note the amazement of the natives in the finding of useful specimens deep in the floors of the very caves in which many of them have lived. The fact that I, a stranger in the region, seemed to have come into their country with the knowledge, or at least the suspicion, that their own caves contained these materials, struck them as decidedly uncanny, and they never ceased to show their astonishment and awe as various artifacts were extracted.154
In Davidson’s summing up, the state of archaeology at this time was considered predominantly in terms of lack of information, as he wrote ‘archaeologically speaking, very little is known of the continent of Australia’. He proclaimed that ‘there is at present considerable information concerning the stonework of southern and south-eastern Australia ... but for the most part this knowledge is concerned with surface finds or ethnological observations’. With the exception of the Devon Downs excavation, the work of Warner in Arnhem Land, and a few others, Davidson proclaims, ‘very few serious attempts at excavation have been made anywhere on the continent’. He continued in this same tone of lack:
Archaeologically Australia stands unique among the continents in the complete lack of pottery and of bows and arrows. For these reasons archaeological investigation is seriously handicapped, for the selection of aboriginal sites, so easily determined where potsherds



140 Writing Heritage
and stone arrow-heads are found, by necessity must depend upon other considerations.155
Davidson’s bleak summary also articulates a powerful discourse of lack in regard to the Aborigines. He continued:
Archaeology is also hindered as the result of the nomadic tendencies of the natives for, in being a purely hunting people, with neither agriculture nor domesticated animals, they seldom remained long at one camp but were constantly on the march in search of game and wild foods.156
He did, however, sound a note of optimism, suggesting other regions may have ‘preserved’ some otherwise ‘perishable’ objects:
The desert areas, on the other hand, may offer compensations in other ways for, as the result of arid conditions, it is possible that many perishable objects may be retrieved. It is to be expected that white ants will have annihilated the remains of wooden objects in some of these regions. In others, however, it may be possible eventually to determine from stratified deposits the histories of development of, or the succession of types of, various wooden tools and weapons and utilitarian and religious objects.157
In general terms, Davidson maintained his view of a material culture based on absence:
Unfortunately the material culture of the Australians is rather meagre, and at first glance this fact would appear to increase the difficulties in retrieving an abundance of material. On the other hand, this condition may prove helpful in the long run in that those objects which are recovered should bear directly upon a few major problems. There is so little archaeological information available at present that it is difficult to outline any strictly archaeological problem.158



‘Just Like a Civilised Artist’ 141
Pre-empting views of people such as Fred McCarthy, he advocated a need for continent-wide archaeological surveys to delineate patterns and typologies in material culture:
What is needed most in Australia is a number of surveys in all parts of the continent to establish in a general way the archaeological areas as determined by types of artifacts, the conditions of preservation, the types of sites and the relative abundance of material in them.
Davidson also defined opinions about origins of Aboriginal material culture:
We cannot be certain at the present time of the derivation of most of the stone tools and weapons found in Australia. Many of them have been reported as surface finds only in localized areas and, as a result, appear to be Indigenous to those regions. Traits which, for the time being, appear to be Indigenous in origin may be found to have been derived from regions which we now would never suspect.159
Here Davidson is advocating a diffusionist approach wherein certain developments in Australian Aboriginal material culture are likely to have originated outside of this continent, and ‘diffused’ into the country.
The 1930s social and political context
Europeans’ writings on the various elements of Aboriginal heritage were not conducted in isolation, but were shaped by, and in turn influenced developments in, policy and legislation in Aboriginal affairs. By the late 1930s the plight of Aboriginal people, suffering the combined effects of drought and destruction of their societies through European settlement in the Northern Territory, began to gain the attention of the Commonwealth Government. In 1939 the Minister for the Interior, John McEwen, set out the basis for a new



142 Writing Heritage
policy on Aboriginal affairs, which was developed under the influence of anthropologist A. P. Elkin.160 This policy represented an important shift away from the idea of ‘preservation’ or protection of Aboriginal peoples’ distinct cultures and lifestyles, to one of assimilation: the Aborigines were to be assimilated into European society through the combined civilising projects of government and the missions. With the growth in control and regulation of Aborigines through policy, there was a corresponding increase in the establishment of bureaucratic and administrative structures for the implementation of laws and policies. A new bureaucracy had been established to administer the Northern Territory, and in particular, Aboriginal people. The appointment of E. W. P. Chinnery in 1939 as Government Adviser on Native Affairs, and then as the first Director of Native Affairs for the Northern Territory, was an important step in this increased machinery of control. After World War II the assimilationist policy of the Commonwealth Government began to be more fully implemented through the Department of the Interior.161

Collecting, Recording and Preserving 145

Collecting, Recording and Preserving: Art, Stone and Bark
Throughout the 1930s to 1940s many Europeans’ writings on Indigenous heritage were still imbued with a sense of wonderment and curiosity. These sentiments contributed to the continued zeal for the collecting, classifying and display of Indigenous cultural materials. Many collectors were possessive of the objects they gathered, imprinting these with the stamp of their own personality. One of those who held such views was Melbourne writer Robert Henderson Croll, who described his interest in collecting in his 1937 narrative Wanderings in Wild Australia:
My first expedition quickened a lifelong interest in our aborigines, an interest that had lain dormant for want of just such an experience. Incidentally I began then a collection of native implements and sacred objects which has grown to be of considerable importance. To increase that collection I have paid visits to most of the well-known, and long-deserted camping grounds in Victoria, but none of these journeys equalled in interest the motor drive to Marree with my friend S. R. Mitchell in 1930.1
This extract raises questions about the value of cultural objects. What did Croll mean when he described his collection as having



146 Writing Heritage
‘considerable importance’, and to whom was it important? How was importance ascribed? These questions become especially interesting in later years when museums and other institutions were seeking to acquire or purchase collections, as will be seen later. Croll also conveyed the enthusiasm for collecting that his colleagues had, as he wrote that ‘never was there a keener collector than Mitchell’.2 Croll described the presence of objects found in former Aboriginal camping grounds, writing that ‘about them, hidden by the sand or exposed by the action of the wind, lie the stone implements dropped by the tribes when they moved camp to another site.’3 There is a profound sadness to Croll’s tone as he evokes the picture of a long-departed people whose former presence was marked only by these cultural objects. Croll expanded on this sense of loss, claiming that the makers of the implements:
... will never return to recover them, for in this particular part of Australia, distant though it is from cities, not one blackfellow remains in his native state to care what becomes of the tools and weapons and articles of daily use which he and his ancestors had taken such pains to fashion. Those implements were what we were hunting.4
Croll wondered at the meanings of these implements, pondering the loss of connection of the objects with Aboriginal people:
We are told by the scientists that many of the relics we were discovering are common to stone-age peoples the world over. Here in Australia we have actual contact to-day with the one considerable body of such folk that still exists; but, and it is an amazing thing, we have to guess at the meaning of much that we pick up. None knows why some of the implements were made and whether they were for particular or general use. There are plenty of speculations of course, and some probably have hit the truth, but in the absence of agreement amongst the experts the layman finds himself standing on the shifting sands of doubt.5



Collecting, Recording and Preserving 147
Croll distances himself and fellow ‘amateur’ collectors here from their professional colleagues, whom he refers to as ‘scientists’. This tension between amateur and professional writers and observers of Aboriginal material culture persisted for many decades. Croll wrote of the scant remnants of the Aborigines’ material culture in a language of pursuit and reward:
An axe with a nicely ground edge was an occasional prize, but nothing wooden remained in this countryside save a few fragments of ancient throwing-sticks. ... Certain dry lakes were dotted with such obvious things as mills and pounding stones.6
In this passage there is also nostalgia for things that have perished and disappeared – once again invoking the unconscious desire for permanence that was so powerfully insistent throughout Europeans’ writings on Indigenous heritage.
Lost relics and the search for meaning
The notion of the Aborigines as a ‘dying race’ dominated many European writings about Aboriginal cultural heritage. As the Aborigines were thought to be disappearing, it was also believed that there was a loss of meaning attached to remaining objects of their culture. This was a source of anxiety for many writers, and underpinned the salvage discourses that prevailed for a long time. Anthropologist Ursula McConnel was another of those who pondered the meaning of objects, as illustrated in a paper published in 1935 in Art in Australia based on her fieldwork in north Queensland.7 She requested that the Australian National Research Council provide funds to ‘purchase these specimens of native art and to carry out further enquiries’.8 In her paper she connected the designs on these objects to the ancestral stories associated with them, and also to the items such as food products that they represent. The Aborigines of this area, she asserted, bring to their designs ‘an artistic appreciation



148 Writing Heritage
of form and colour, a delightful sense of humour, a joy in the good things of life, and, above all, an intimate knowledge of nature’. She concluded:
It has thus been possible not only to salvage these interesting relics of a dying art, but to place on record something of their meaning. It is doubtful if this art will survive the life-time of the present artists, and certainly its meaning might have vanished forever unrecorded.9
Where Croll’s narrative is imbued with sadness and the nostalgia of loss, McConnel’s writing evokes a sense of appreciation of the intricately designed objects left by the departed makers. Her emphasis on salvage, and the survival of the art, echoes other writers concerned with the European ideal of permanence and preservation. Another observer puzzled by an absence of meaning was R. H. Goddard who, in August 1935, had visited some ‘remarkable’ rock carvings on a formation that he referred to as ‘Devil’s Rock’ in New South Wales.10 He wrote of these in a paper delivered to a meeting in 1937 of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science, in Auckland:
The almost total absence of historical facts relative to the aborigine of Australia, during the long ages that have passed since the continent was first peopled until the advent of the white man precludes the possibility of any satisfactory data upon which to trace their ancestry. We are therefore compelled to fall back upon the rock sculptures, cave paintings, and the language for the solution of the problem.
Once again, the emphasis here is on the physical, although unlike many, Goddard included language as a means to understanding Aboriginal culture.



Collecting, Recording and Preserving 149
The artifact hunter and the archaeologist
By the 1930s and 1940s collectors were still acquiring their objects mostly from the surface. They incessantly tramped the fields and paddocks of the countryside picking up ‘relics’ and pondering the meaning, form and function of these. Although surface collecting continued, in this period the growth of the discipline of archaeology, especially controlled excavations, became an influence on the collection and interpretation of material culture. One consequence of this growth in archaeology was a tension between the methods of the amateur collectors and those of the professional archaeologists. Mulvaney and Calaby commented on the collecting strategies of people such as Croll, Kenyon, Barrett and others, bemoaning that ‘under Kenyon’s dogmatic spell, artefact hunters scoured southeastern Australia for over half a century, leaving little behind for latter-day archaeologists’.11 These concerns are reinforced by a comment from Stan Mitchell, a keen Victorian collector, who wrote to Fred McCarthy in 1944 describing material collected at various Victorian localities:
I have posted a set of artifacts from Pt. Cook, a bayside campsite about 16 miles South-West of Melbourne. This one and another at Altona are the only ones of importance between Melbourne and Geelong. They have yielded a large number of microlithic forms, but very few of the larger types other than ground axes, and a few pebble implements. Unfortunately the latter were gathered by earlier collectors, and we have little information about them or their numbers.12
This clearing activity notwithstanding, Mulvaney and Calaby commented that there were also some benefits in collectors’ activities, since ‘their efforts proved to be a not unmixed blessing, because these dedicated men labelled their specimens and hoarded them, even though they were highly selective in their collection building’.13 The labelling and classifying of the collections was considered by



150 Writing Heritage
most collectors, archaeologists and museum curators to be of particular importance. This became evident in later years as collectors discussed the possible transfer of their collections to museums, and the labelling of these collections assumed significance as a marker of the collector’s individual personality. As Australian Museum curator, Joseph Shellshear, observed in 1937:
... The question might well be asked: Why do men collect these relics of ancient man? There are many reasons: Firstly, they are collected for personal gain. There is an exaggerated idea of the value of stone implements and a fictitious price is put on them. Recently I saw an implement in a shop window in Sydney, and in curiosity I asked its price. I found that fifteen shillings was being asked for the implement, although the vendor had no idea of its place of origin.14
Croll’s tjurungas
Many Europeans saw remote Australia as a place of particular fascination and desire, as an imagined place where one could find the ‘real’ Aborigines. Croll made several visits to Central Australia, mostly in the company of artist friends. Describing this region as ‘long a place of desire’, Croll’s encounter with Aborigines there helped shape his views on the ‘ideal’ Aborigines, whom he believed were ‘corrupted’ by European culture. He wrote in his 1939 published memoir:
My reaction to the aboriginal each time that I meet him in Central Australia is always one of disgust with my own kind. I am not speaking of the wild, naked people (rarely to be met with now) but of those who have eaten of the tree of knowledge of good and evil as introduced by us and have learnt shame. In other words, they are clothed. Usually that transforms them from upright free-moving men and women to shambling mendicants. Then we scorn them for being shabby and for being beggars, conditions which we have forced upon them.15



Collecting, Recording and Preserving 151
Croll’s visit to Central Australia in 1934, accompanied by Melbourne artists Rex Battarbee and John Gardner, was his fourth trip to the region. His private diary conjures his excitement in collecting Aboriginal cultural objects:
Mr & Mrs Gill welcomed us to morning tea and we stayed to lunch also (fowl), not leaving till 3.30. He has 3 fine old Churinga, the mates of those held for him in Melb. by his uncle W. H. Gill and he told us that he has the whole contents (save 8 Churinga) of the famous Emily Gap corroboree cave mentioned by Spencer. Bought them from a government official in the Alice. Has permission of the native owners to open up two corroboree caves now, but does not intend to do so, at least not at present.16
As in the narratives of the Horn Expedition reviewed earlier, Croll’s writing also illustrates the desire that Europeans had for acquiring tjurungas, as they proudly boasted about their collections of these. The statement that Gill had ‘permission of the native owners’ to open up ‘corroboree caves’ suggests that for all their zealous collecting of tjurungas, some Europeans did recognise that the Aboriginal people were the owners of these objects. Either this, or that the Aborigines were coerced into revealing the location of the tjurungas, as in the Horn Expedition. Croll’s enthusiasm for these sacred objects is palpable in his diary entry for April:
Great lot of dinkum old Churinga (in 2 boxes) brought from Petermann and far west by a couple of natives on their backs. My mouth watered for some of the largest of course but prices have gone up and Mr Albrecht’s book of charges is away with him so I did not dare go very deeply into the buying. Really big old stone ones are up by £1, the prices varying with the size ... I selected about 5 and took some little bullroarers and a few odds and ends which were at the bottom of an old chest where knives, pointing bones, nosebones, etc. are kept.17



152 Writing Heritage
Tjurungas, like many Indigenous cultural objects, were increasingly assigned monetary value and were sought as commodities for a growing market. For Croll at least, the features of these and other cultural objects that appealed were their obvious physical attributes such as size, and their supposed age (the older, the better). Almost childlike in his enthusiasm, Croll salivates as he yearns for the largest, but ultimately he is constrained by the practicalities of purchase.
Observing and recording art: Albert Namatjira
At the same time as Europeans were building their collections of Indigenous cultural objects and pondering the meanings of these, another aspect of Aboriginal heritage was increasingly occupying their attention. The fascination with Aboriginal art did not only dwell on the images seen and recorded on stone, cave walls and bark. The rising prominence of living Aboriginal artists such as Albert Namatjira was also becoming a favoured subject for debate and discussion. In 1943 artist and teacher Rex Battarbee wrote eagerly to E. W. P. Chinnery, anthropologist and Director of Native Affairs for the Northern Territory from 1932, of the market potential of Namatjira’s work:
... Albert Namatjira is still away on his painting trip, even at the higher price all his pictures have been sold and we have a list of people waiting to buy so we are going to have another talk over prices it seems as though there is no limit to what his pictures will go, but I think we will stop private sales and save up for an exhibition ...18
Not only was Battarbee enthusiastic about the impact of this art on the western commercial world, but he also expressed his excitement



Collecting, Recording and Preserving 153
about its adoption by other artists, and the transfer of the artists’ work onto other objects:
Since you were here several of the boomerang painters have made a big advance in their work and are painting on woomeras now and some are keen to be watercolourists so we have no shortage of artists. I feel that this place will become famous for its artists. Some of the woomeras painted by these young men make Albert’s work look old fashioned.19
So powerfully did Namatjira capture the popular imagination that he became the focus of contested views and interests among many Europeans intent on recording his and other Hermannsburg artists’ work. In 1946 Battarbee wrote to Ralph Foster, who was film commissioner with the then Commonwealth Department of Information, to complain about the South Australian Charles Mountford making a film about Namatjira and the Pareroultja Brothers:
Messrs Poignant and Robinson told me that advice had been received by them to the effect that the Pareroultja Brothers are to be included in the film now being made of Albert Namatjira. After thinking the matter over from all angles, I feel I should write and bring the following before you for consideration. Without any exageration [sic], I am safe to say that without my efforts none of these native artists would have achieved anything like they have, or managed to establish themselves. And even now I feel that their work would largely be wasted if I ceased directing them. This does not in the least mean that I am trying to make copyists of them, rather try and lead them to express themselves in their art individually. This effort, I believe, has been particularly successful with the Pareroultja Brothers, and I would deplore it if they would be shown together with Albert Namatjira. Such a film would show neither of them at their best; they would lose their individuality, the most striking point in their development so far.20



154 Writing Heritage
This is a bold statement of European intervention in the creation and production of Aboriginal creativity. With an eye for the market, Battarbee promoted his own role in the development of the work of artists such as Namatjira. His claims to having been the sole impetus for the Hermannsburg painters’ increasingly renowned work also finds its expression in his desire to control the representation of these artists by filmmakers. In expressing his concern at the possibility of this film being made by Mountford, Battarbee detailed some of the problems he believed existed with Mountford’s potential role. He concluded by indicating the future success he saw in Aboriginal art:
At the same time I feel that the Pareroultja Brothers will be famous in the world of art, and something should be done to bring their work before the public. Such publicity would not only benefit the men concerned but the Aborigines as such, and is of sufficient importance to be taken up by your Department.21
Battarbee’s prediction of what was to eventually become part of a significant Aboriginal fine art industry evokes the growing relationship between Europeans’ museum-like notions of preservation and recording of Aboriginal cultural heritage, and the emerging importance of market and commodity aspects to this heritage.
Mountford and palaeolithic art
Although the development of the unique artistic style of Namatjira and other Hermannsburg Aborigines signalled an important new direction in Aboriginal art, many Europeans continued to hold the view that Aboriginal art should be what they regarded as ‘pure’ or ‘authentic’, untainted by European influence. South Australian Charles Mountford was for a long time one of the chief advocates of this ‘stone age’ view of Aboriginal art and culture. In 1937 Mountford participated in an expedition to Nepabunna, in the northern



Collecting, Recording and Preserving 155
Flinders Ranges of South Australia, where he provided paper and chalks to Aboriginal children and asked them to make ‘marks’. His diary entry for Wednesday, 29 December illustrates his concerns about European influence in the resulting drawings:
Today the drawings and associated legends have started to roll in. Some of the drawings are remarkably good. Europeanised somewhat, but distinctive. Not a single one of the artists have had any training. I made special inquiries about that.22
Mountford’s assumption that quality fine art can usually only result from training begs many questions. We can only speculate, for example, as to what he meant by ‘training’; either he had in mind the training of Aborigines by Europeans in western techniques and practices, or that they had no formal training from the Elders in their community, but rather had acquired their skills by observation. His admiration of the quality of these drawings highlights the continuing theme in Europeans’ writings that was concerned with the nature of Indigenous peoples’ cultural creativity, and their ‘originality’ of expression in the context of European intrusions.
Aboriginal art in comparative context: D. S. Davidson
Aboriginal art was often compared with that of ancient Europe, or with the art of other cultures such as African bushmen. One writer who pursued such comparisons was the American archaeologist Daniel Sutherland Davidson, who conducted brief fieldwork in northern Australia in 1930 while visiting during 1930–31 as a Fellow of the Social Science Research Council. In his 1936 publication Davidson claimed that Australia ‘is now the only continent where rock painting still flourishes as a normal cultural expression, although rock carving appears to be no longer practiced’.23 Placing rock art in a global context, he thought that this



156 Writing Heritage
form of cultural expression had all but disappeared, and it ‘is only in Australia that we can still find the artists at work’.24 Davidson compared Australian Aboriginal rock art with the ‘European art of the Glacial Period and Bushmen art in Africa’. Where in these other regions ‘the surrounding fauna so important to a hunting people has been emphasized’, he stated that ‘in Australia, however, the superb qualities of the art of these other areas is lacking’. Explaining this deficiency he wrote:
The portrayals, although realistic in essence, are not marked by the animation so obvious in the other regions. The Australian artist has not caught the living spirit of his animals, nor has he ventured to portray them with the fidelity to life that characterizes Palaeolithic and Bushmen endeavours. In these appearances the artists, although following closely the conventional style and pattern of their day, nevertheless were unfettered in respect to detail. They painted their animals browsing, stalking, running, resting, at bay or in any one of a dozen other postures and they reproduced their impressions with a fidelity to life which has evoked the admiration of all who have beheld.25
Davidson contrasts the Australian Aboriginal rock images:
This is not so for the Australian. His naturalism is of a different sort, a realism not in the free and unrestricted sense of the word in which free play of the brush is encouraged within certain broad cultural limitations, but a realism apparently closely governed by cultural forces which seem to impose rough conventionalizations and to confine expression to more or less fixed and narrow channels.26
Here Davidson recognises the cultural context of Aboriginal art and its basis in customary law. In his 1937 study of decorative art he wrote in a language of absence:



Collecting, Recording and Preserving 157
... There are many factors in Australian culture which do not encourage high technical development in decorative art even if we could grant that technical perfection is a goal of Australian artists. Being a hunting and wild food collecting people more or less constantly on the march in search of anything and everything edible their material wealth is strictly limited to the carrying capacity of their own bodies, with the consequence that specialized tools and supplies from distant areas must be reduced to a minimum. The Australians thus apparently tend to find it more convenient to limit the scope of their decorative art to those techniques which are associated with other activities, or which require no specialized equipment, than to give much attention to elaborations which require added physical hardships.27
This is a familiar refrain, portraying, Aborigines as minimalist, pragmatic and focused on daily subsistence activities.
Other writers on material culture: missionary, geologist and anthropologist
There was no single, homogeneous European Australian view of Indigenous heritage. Rather, there was a wide range of perspectives, by people from diverse disciplines and backgrounds. For example, in 1938 the missionary the Rev. Theodore Webb, Chairman of the Methodist Mission in North Australia, described Aboriginal peoples’ material culture in an evolutionary framework, claiming that ‘in his material culture the aboriginal has not risen above the stone age. That is to say, he has not of himself discovered the use of metals.’28 While Webb cast his discussion of Aboriginal peoples’ material culture generally within a context of lack, or absence, he nonetheless held some aspects of their cultural products in high regard. He commented that ‘in other directions, however, the handicrafts of the aboriginal have reached a considerable stage of development, though



158 Writing Heritage
their range is somewhat limited’. Like many people at that time, Webb had some fascination with Aboriginal weapons:
Most of their weapons are of wood, and consist of spears of many types, spear-throwers, boomerangs of a heavy type, and long twohanded clubs or wooden swords with the blade sharpened on both edges. All these weapons are beautifully fashioned and finished. Many of the spears, with hafts eight feet or more in length, and with heads of delicate and intricate design, are carved, with such crude tools as they possess, from a single piece of hardwood. The clubs are constructed with perfect symmetry from the extremely hard and heavy ironwood, and are perfectly smoothed and polished.29
Webb had similar praise for the quality of string and basketwork. He continued:
Practically all their weapons and utensils, but particularly their sacred objects, are decorated by an art which has reached a truly striking degree of development. With infinite care and patience, designs of intricate patterns or representations of natural species are reproduced in minute lines of coloured clays laid on with a tiny twig, the end of which has been crushed to form a rude brush. Many kinds of cord, ranging from fine twine to stout rope, are spun from vegetable fibre, the fur of animals, or human hair. Into much of this cord, when used for ceremonial purposes, are neatly and skilfully woven the bright feathers of parrots and other birds, with very pleasing and striking effect. Some of the contrivances and methods employed for taking fish or game are both ingenious and highly effective.30
As well as missionaries, those involved in the natural sciences such as geology, surveying and zoology – also had particular interests in aspects of Aboriginal life. For example, the geologist Charles Madigan had an eye for signs of Aboriginal peoples’ stone artifacts,



Collecting, Recording and Preserving 159
as he described in his account of the 1939 Simpson Desert expedition:
Nodules of ironstone lay around, and pieces of chalcedony. Crocker discovered a small rock outcrop of chalcedonized sandstone. More interesting still was the discovery of signs of the former presence of aboriginals, the only such indications seen in the whole desert crossing. There were chips of chalcedony, typical of aboriginal workshop sites where knives, scrapers and spearheads have been made, and also parts of grinding stones, one a piece of schist that must have come from the MacDonnells.31
Perhaps most prominent among the kinds of Europeans who wrote about Aboriginal cultural heritage were the anthropologists. Lloyd Warner was an American anthropologist who published the experiences of his fieldwork among the Murngin people of northeast Arnhem Land in 1937. Warner remarked of the Aboriginal people that ‘they belong to a Stone Age culture; were they placed in our own chronology, their technological development would fall somewhere between the Old and the New Stone Ages’.32 This comment typifies the kind of evolutionary discourse that persisted in writings on Aboriginal cultural heritage for much of the century. By firmly placing the Aborigines’ technological development in some invented past labelled as ‘Stone Age’, writers established a perpetual distance from the peoples they described, in both time and space. This distancing serves to maintain an uneven power relationship between the writers and the objects of their writing.33 Warner viewed Murngin technology as an integral part of their cultural system:
The Murngin material culture is comparatively simple, and a study of their implements offers an opportunity to examine some of the physical activities of a people who have been disciplined by technological behavior. ... The making of any one article of culture is associated with every technical process in the whole of the



160 Writing Heritage
material culture of the tribe. Material culture, in its turn, articulates with every other branch of culture, so that starting with such a small element in technology as the making of a spear-thrower one must ultimately consider the whole of the civilization.34
Warner’s work was a reference for later anthropological and archaeological work in Arnhem Land, as is discussed below.
Calls for preservation
Europeans continued to call for preservation of the art and culture they were observing and documenting, and from the 1930s this interest in preservation began to grow among those in professional and official positions as well as among ‘amateurs’. The need for laws to regulate the collecting and export of Aboriginal cultural materials had been recognised from the early 1900s, and customs legislation was used for this purpose. One influential figure involved in these early moves for preservation was Baldwin Spencer, who, ‘as a result of his experience in the Northern Territory during 1912, ... advised the Commonwealth government that stringent control was necessary over the export of Aboriginal ethnographic and skeletal material’.35 Spencer’s influence resulted in the government issuing a proclamation of 22 November 1913 under the Customs Act 1901–1910.36
Amateur collectors were among those who voiced their concerns for measures to be taken for preservation, as Towle wrote to his Victorian colleague Kenyon in 1936:
I do hope that the Victorians will quickly formulate proposals for the preservation of our national monuments. I want to see them take the lead and maintain it.37
Towle was particularly concerned about rock engraving sites in New South Wales, and he described the threats these sites faced from encroaching settlement:



Collecting, Recording and Preserving 161
We have had some very enjoyable excursions of late to the rock carvings and paintings along the Hawkesbury. Some of the series we have visited are relatively unknown. The great number of carvings and paintings around Port Jackson and the Hawkesbury baffles description. Campbell in his book missed many more than he recorded. The tragedy is that as the suburbs extend the carvings disappear. The problem of preserving them is most difficult. I am of the opinion that our best plan will be to have the best of them protected. I fear that there is no possibility of saving them all. From where I live at Eastwood I am able to reach many very fine groups in a short time and am able to observe the destructive processes now going on.38
In this passage we see references to selective preservation; Europeans assigned priority to particular sites over others. This selectivity raises questions about the nature of the process: for example, what criteria were used to determine which sites were (in Towle’s terms) ‘the best’? Was ‘significance’ a factor, and if so, how? Although Victorian collector Stan Mitchell agreed with Towle on the need for legislation to prevent illicit export of cultural materials, he thought that such legislation could have undesirable consequences for the serious collector:
Personally I am with you in keeping the science free because if we have the suggested restrictions, Australian ethnological material will greatly increase in value and an undesirable element will profit by illicit collecting and disposal of the spoils overseas. ... It might be advisable to have restrictions on the indiscriminate digging of caves, providing men like yourself could be given a licence to do so, especially in association with some reputable body ... Could your Society [the Anthropological Society of NSW] not make a recommendation to the effect and try to get control of the work. Similarly with the recording and preservation of rock carvings; this should be in the hand of a live committee. Our Council for the Preservation of National Monuments will work along these lines, first of all to



162 Writing Heritage
try to secure legislation and then suggest means of carrying out the work.39
As well as concerned individuals such as Mitchell, Kenyon and Towle, some people in official positions also articulated a desire for formal measures for preservation. Representations were made to the Prime Minister calling for legislation to protect what were collectively referred to as ‘national monuments’. In 1937 A. B. Walker, General Secretary of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science, conveyed that organisation’s recently passed resolution concerning protection of Aboriginal heritage. The science body informed the Commonwealth Government ‘that it views with great concern the unchecked destruction of relics of prehistoric value in Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, and the Pacific Islands’. It requested ‘the various Governments and administrations concerned to take such steps as may seem advisable to provide for the declaration as national monuments, and thus the protection of the following relics’:
cave and rock shelter deposits, rock carvings and paintings; burial grounds and graves; stone structures and arrangements; and any other relics of prehistoric interest; and to make provision for the examination by approved societies and institutions of cave and rock shelters and camp and village sites.
The Association went on to outline the kind of destructive activities it sought to have outlawed:
The destruction referred to in the resolution includes the defacement of rock carvings and paintings, and the disturbance of stone structures and arrangements; and also the destruction of valuable archaeological data by irresponsible and ill-considered digging up of cave deposits and camp sites for the artefacts and skeletal remains therein contained.40



Collecting, Recording and Preserving 163
A similar representation was made from D. MacCallum, Honorary Secretary of the Point Piper Branch of the United Australia Party. This organisation put to the Prime Minister a resolution ‘unanimously requesting that the matter of preserving aboriginal curios and relics be brought to your notice’. Concerned about ‘two foreign expeditions ... at present operating in South Australia’, MacCallum wrote that ‘it is desired that you treat the matter as urgent, and bring it to the immediate notice of the Federal Government’. He urged that ‘legislation be enacted by the State and Federal Governments of Australia’ to:
Prohibit except under strict government supervision the export of all aboriginal curios from Australia, Protect and preserve all aboriginal relics in situ, including rock engravings and paintings, ceremonial sites, burial grounds, and all deposits of archaeological value, Ensure Government control of all excavations of pre-historic deposits, Apply adequate penalties for infringement of the above regulations.41
These calls for preservation of Aboriginal heritage prompted some, such as Interior Minister John McEwen, to acknowledge limitations in the Commonwealth’s powers. In 1939 he wrote to his colleague, the Minister for External Territories, pointing out some of these limitations:
The question of the prohibition of the export of aboriginal curios from Australia is one for consideration by our colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs. ... In so far as the protection and preservation of aboriginal relics and curios are concerned, the Commonwealth has jurisdiction only in the territories of the Commonwealth. There is not at present any law on this subject, in force in either the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern



164 Writing Heritage
Territory. Some steps have, however, been taken to protect and preserve relics of pre-historic value.42
International developments were among the factors that influenced some official bodies in their calls for national legislation. L. H. Giles, a representative of the Northern Territory administration, drew attention to the work of the League of Nations in a letter to the Secretary of the Department of the Interior in May 1939:
Protectors of Aboriginals have also been instructed to furnish information concerning the location of any objects of antiquity as defined in the League of Nations circular No. 38/29480 of 9th November, 1938. No information in this regard has, however, yet been received. Notwithstanding the fact that, at present, there is little information available as to the existence of relics of pre-historic value, it is thought that legislation should be provided to prevent the export from Australia of any such items which might be discovered in the future and also to prevent the removal of rock markings, etc., from their original sites. In the absence of any such law, Police Officers and Protectors could do little to prevent the removal or defacing of such relics. It is obviously desirable that any such legislation should cover the whole of the Commonwealth and it would thus be necessary to approach each of the States with a view to having similar legislation promulgated in each.43
In advocating legislation, it was becoming increasingly apparent that what was needed were better definitions and descriptions of what comprised ‘relics’ or ‘national monuments’. Key considerations included whether ‘objects of antiquity’ or ‘objects of prehistoric value’ should be protected, and the range and types of material that such legislation should preserve. This problem of definition did not yet extend to questions about ‘ownership’ of Aboriginal heritage since, in their concern for preservation, Europeans did not consider heritage as belonging to the Aborigines as a specific group. They



Collecting, Recording and Preserving 165
held that this heritage was in need of saving as national or even global heritage. Couched in terms such as ‘monuments’, ‘curios’ or ‘curiosities’, ‘antiquities’ and ‘relics’, Aboriginal cultural heritage was still regarded primarily as something of value to science and nation. One person who was to become increasingly vocal in the discussions and debates about preservation and legislative protection of Aboriginal cultural heritage was Frederick David McCarthy, a prominent figure in Australian Aboriginal archaeology and art, whose career and writings spanned several decades. McCarthy began work at the Australian Museum in Sydney in 1932, and spent several decades there as curator of anthropology before taking up appointment as the first Principal of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies when that body was formally established by statute in 1964.44 In one of his early published writings, McCarthy argued for legislative protection of Aboriginal heritage in terms of its value for the ‘science of anthropology’:
The vital need for legislation for the preservation of prehistoric and aboriginal relics in New South Wales, and Australia generally, has long been recognized by those interested in the subject. Up to the present the public has shown that it cannot be trusted to regard such relics with due respect and no more important step forward for the science of anthropology could be made than the enactment of such legislation throughout Australia.45
McCarthy’s partner and colleague at the Australian Museum, Elsie Bramell, also argued in 1939 for the preservation of Aboriginal heritage as what she termed ‘national property’:
A matter of grave concern to all interested in the aboriginal Australians and their achievements as craftsmen and artists of the Stone Age, is the continued destruction of relics of their culture throughout the continent. These relics include rock paintings and engravings, caves occupied and deposits left by the aborigines, and other objects in situ, such as burial grounds, carved trees, stone



166 Writing Heritage
arrangements, kitchen middens, quarries, and totem centres; secondly, portable artefacts or objects, skeletons and skulls – all of their very nature national property, and the preservation of which, therefore, is the responsibility of each and every one of us.46
Bramell’s writing here illustrates the emphasis on compiling lists and inventories, and is typical of a discourse that posited a lost culture that could be known only by its material traces. Another advocate for protective legislation was Professor Joseph Shellshear, honorary archaeologist at the Australian Museum. In 1937, drawing attention to the destruction of archaeological sites and artifacts resulting from vandalism and unscrupulous collectors, Shellshear wrote:
Whilst it is obvious that steps will have to be taken to preserve what is left of the aboriginal remains, as has been done by the legislature in other countries, it is of interest to analyse the causes of this wholesale destruction. This is done not to offend those whose collecting efforts are laudable, but in the hope that some thought will be given to preservation not only in New South Wales, but also in other States.47
Authenticity again: McCarthy, Goddard and Kalboori Youngi
In the context of growing interest in preservation, Europeans continued to express their anxieties about ‘authentic’ or ‘traditional’ Aboriginal art, heritage and culture. These anxieties are illustrated by a debate that arose in relation to a paper presented to the 1939 meeting of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science (ANZAAS), held in Canberra.48 This paper by R. H. Goddard described a ‘gifted Australian Aboriginal sculptress’ called Kalboori Youngi of the Pitta Pitta people in the Diamantina region of central western Queensland. Goddard praised the skills of Youngi, whose carved clay figures he thought were the



Collecting, Recording and Preserving 167
creations of an ‘artist of outstanding merit’. In the paternalistic tone common for this period, Goddard considered the Aborigines to ‘possess talents, capabilities, aspirations, and artistic instincts that are merely dormant and only need the vitalizing guidance of a kindly hand to burgeon into life’. Goddard did, however, ascribe an Indigenous cultural origin to Youngi’s work, arguing that the artist’s talent was rooted in her culture, and was not the result of contact with missions. He characterised the Pitta Pitta people as ‘virtually a tribe of hereditary artists’, stating that:
numerous rock-drawings, paintings and carvings can be seen from one end of the Diamantina to the other, the most extensive being in caves and rocks on Brighton Downs Station, and they were executed long before the white man took up his pastoral holdings.49
Goddard claimed that although Youngi’s ‘tribe is now “civilized” to the extent that it has been forced to accept the inevitable contact with station-life, it has not been degraded by the influence of what we misname civilization; a fact that seems beyond comprehension’, and that Youngi ‘has not known the influence of the Mission station’. She worked, he wrote, ‘with dexterous hand and keen artistic eye’, and ‘shows all the characteristics of the artistic temperament’.50 He offered some suggestions for enabling the Aborigines to ‘progress’ using their artistic talents:
There must be many Kalboori Youngis among our aborigines. Why not give them the opportunity of developing their artistic tendencies along lines that may become a source of profit such as the manufacture of pottery and other industries that other races in a primitive state of progress have evolved? Thus the race could acquire a sense of self-sufficiency and independence that might prove its salvation from the doom of extinction to which our culpable indifference has condemned it.51



168 Writing Heritage
Later writers, such as A. P. Elkin and Leonhard Adam, also articulated this sentiment. Both of these writers advocated at different times, and in different contexts, the virtues of encouraging Aboriginal communities to develop ‘art and craft’ industries oriented towards the market. While Goddard extolled the virtues of Youngi’s art as an Indigenous expression of her community, Fred McCarthy had a different view. He argued that Kalboori Youngi’s skill could not have been developed without the influence of Europeans. He wrote to the Honorary Secretary of ANZAAS to ‘register a strong protest against the inclusion of papers such as that on pages 160–163, with plate, entitled Aboriginal Sculpture, by R. H. Goddard’. McCarthy explained his view on European influence:
The author’s claim that the work of this aboriginal woman, Kalboori Youngi, is uninfluenced by European ideas should have been carefully checked before publication, and in fact, her lifehistory fully investigated. The Pitta Pitta tribe, of which she is a member, had been brought under white influence when Dr. W. E. Roth made his investigations on its ethnography between 1890 and 1897, and the process has continued more intensely till the present time. A study of aboriginal Australian art reveals that plastic work was unknown prior to the penetration of the continent by the white man. To-day, there are Aranda artists in Central Australia painting upon canvas, and others who have produced plastic work under the tuition of the missionaries. Thus, an important cultural principle is involved, i.e., whether the technique of plastic work is Indigenous to Australia, or whether, like practically all other advanced techniques in their material culture, it would have had to diffuse from New Guinea or Malaya.52
McCarthy’s diffusionist view is prominent here, as he argued that Aboriginal cultural traits had seeped into Australia from neigh



Collecting, Recording and Preserving 169
bouring regions to the north. Calling for more information on Kalboori Youngi’s ‘life history’, McCarthy concluded:
As one who has made a special study of aboriginal art, I feel that I can speak with some authority. I can not therefore, accept Mr. Goddard’s claims without detailed information about Kalboori Youngi’s life-history. Further, I am of the opinion that the Committee of Section F erred in selecting this paper for inclusion in the report, because it will give rise to misconceptions about their work.53
The reply from Margaret Walkom contained more than a hint that McCarthy was verging on arrogance in his views on Aboriginal art:
The Committee of Section F must surely have been aware of the contents of the paper and also of any comment or criticism that may have been made when the paper was read. If the Committee considered there was any justification for the publication of Mr. Goddard’s views they were quite within their rights in recommending the paper for publication. You surely would not wish to take up the position that no views on aboriginal art should be published that do not coincide with your own, and yet your letter is open to that interpretation. I am forwarding a copy of your letter and my reply to the honorary secretary of the Section at the Canberra meeting for any comment he may wish to make.54
Professor A. P. Elkin, Secretary of ‘Section F’ on anthropology, responded to Walkom, supporting the inclusion of Goddard’s paper in the ANZAAS meeting, stating that:
I have to say that I think that the Committee did not err in recommending its inclusion. I, like Mr. McCarthy, felt that I should like much more information about the Aboriginal woman concerned and I enquired as thoroughly as I could from Mr. Goddard who has been in the area and who has connections there and he has always stuck to his information that the woman was



170 Writing Heritage
untaught and had not seen sculptured works. Now that the paper is published, if people criticize it Mr. Goddard must stand up to it and endeavour to satisfy them.55
Elkin imparted a moderate tone to the debate, agreeing that Kalboori Youngi’s work warranted having its description in Goddard’s paper, but also accepting the need for more information on Youngi’s background. He explained to Walkom:
But apart from the two or three lines in which he makes that statement, Mr. Goddard’s paper was, in our opinion, worth publishing for another reason, namely, that whether the woman had ever had any help or not, it showed that an Aborigine was capable of doing quite good plastic work and that itself is a very important point. Of course, Aborigines have done some carving in the round in fact I have a very fine head in small dimensions carved in the round in wood on my mantelpiece which was carved in the ’nineties by a Queensland black. If we could get some details about the woman’s life history all the better, but in the meantime her work was worth the note which Mr. Goddard’s very short paper gave.56
Kalboori Youngi’s work also came to the attention of other writers, such as Roman Black, a visiting Polish writer who described the artist’s work in his 1964 book:
The young aboriginal sculptress carved her earlier work with a flake of quartzite until someone gave her a superior tool, a pocket-knife. R. H. Goddard described and illustrated some of her limestone carvings, which he acquired from the artist in 1938 when she came to the cattle station for food. These are now in the Australian Institute of Anatomy, Canberra ...57
Like many of the collections of the former Australian Institute of Anatomy, these carvings are now held by the National Museum of Australia. Black praised Kalboori’s originality:



Collecting, Recording and Preserving 171
When artists in Sydney saw these aboriginal carvings in the round, they hailed them as ‘the work of creative genius’ and compared Kalboori Youngi’s work with primitive Chinese sculpture. Dr Leonhard Adam described it as having a ‘naïve, almost Gothic simplicity’. The original work of a person who has not seen other sculpture before rightly deserves such praise.58
Europeans would continue to worry and debate about the possibility, nature and extent of ‘outside’ influences on Aboriginal cultural productions.
‘What do we know about them?’: gathering information
The correspondence over Kalboori Youngi highlighted the growing interest in gathering information about the details of Aboriginal life and in documenting and recording these details in as many different forms as possible. Fred McCarthy was prominent in advocating wide-ranging field studies of Aboriginal societies, including material culture, as he proclaimed to Mountford in 1941:
... Your remarks about the use of rough unworked stones by the aborigines are interesting and of course of the greatest importance. Every scrap of direct evidence should be published, and it is essential that more field-work be done in Australia to see what and how the remaining aborigines make of stone. We have tens of thousands of implements in collections, all beautifully selected, but what do we know about them?59
This urge to document and record Aboriginal life had a competitive dimension as writers, collectors and observers sought to be ‘the first’ to find or observe some aspect of Aboriginal culture and heritage, and to proclaim their authority over their work. Mountford was one who was particularly adept at promoting his own work, as he boasted to Towle of his film record of stone tool making:



172 Writing Heritage
... I am, or will be, sending you a paper, on what I think is a find of some importance, re, the making of a wooden spearthrower, almost entirely with unflaked tools. We, of course, thought there was a time when man did not flake stone, but never expected to see living people doing it. However, now it is, and supported by about 250 feet of cine film, perhaps twenty stills, the stone, themselves, and the implement. I think this will quieten all doubters, for they always exist.60
In Mountford’s view, these records were ‘evidence’ or ‘proof’ of the existence of some aspect of the Aboriginal cultures. The production of records and documents was also a means by which Europeans could establish their authority on certain aspects of Aboriginal culture.
Material culture and social anthropology
The ongoing description and recording of Aboriginal culture and heritage was conducted within a milieu of rivalry and competition between individuals, and also between disciplines. This competitiveness is illustrated by remarks made by material culture specialists about those whom they considered their ‘rivals’, the social anthropologists. For example, while ruminating to his colleague Lindsay Black in 1941 on the meaning of ‘ceremonial grounds’, Towle moaned:
With reference to ceremonial grounds. It seems to me that in Australia we have primarily two kinds of ceremonial practices: 1) connected with totemic beliefs and 2) connected with initiations. Fortunately we know something of both ceremonies; unfortunately, we do not know enough of either of them. ... The whole trouble about the matter is that men like Howitt who were so interested in the aborigines, did not take the trouble to describe in detail all that happened during the ceremonies. They



Collecting, Recording and Preserving 173
have left out much concerning the paraphernalia of the ceremonies which would have been of the utmost value to us now. On the other hand, the social anthropologist is too highly superior to bother his superior intelligence about details. Not one of the descriptions made by a social anthropologist gives any real information about the material arrangements connected with increase rites. In every way, the social anthropologist has failed to record material culture. This failure will become more apparent later on. At the present time so much is being learned of the social and spiritual life of the aborigines that the deficiency on the side of material culture has almost passed unnoticed. Again and again, I go to their writings for guidance on material culture and am left wanting. In other words, they do not take a wide enough interest in anthropology. They fail to understand that social anthropology is one aspect only of the life and doings of the aborigines. Of course, they would indignantly deny my statements; they assert that they are the ‘king pins’ of anthropology. Work like mine is hardly worth notice.61
Towle’s comments suggest an almost desperate sense of conviction that some amateur collectors and observers had in their own work, and their desire to be given consideration equal to that of the professionals. This letter was written at a time when professional anthropology was in the ascendancy, with its emphasis on studies of social relations and its role in providing advice for administration and policy. This may have heightened the anxieties felt by the ‘amateurs’, and prompted their criticisms of the anthropologists.
Other European responses: Margaret Preston and Fred McCarthy
While ethnologists and anthropologists were competing over their theories and collections, others were responding in quite different ways to the art and culture that they observed in Aboriginal societies. Many writers continued to be inspired by visits to remote



174 Writing Heritage
regions of Central Australia and the Northern Territory. The artist Margaret Preston, who had been writing since the 1920s urging recognition of Aboriginal art, was captivated by the art that she saw on a visit to Arnhem Land, and wrote in 1940:
It has been for a long time the accepted idea of the world in general that the Australian aboriginal is in the lowest grade of humanity. This unfortunate impression should be completely altered after a study of his pictorial and decorative art.62
Preston responded eagerly to the Arnhem Land art, seeing it as a basis for a national Australian art:
Outside the cave are walls of high rock, some decorated by long, attenuated figures of spirit men; others by drawings of kangaroos, and yet another with a curious drawing of a gnome. The surrounding district contains many other paintings, but it is difficult country to travel over, and demands the constant service of the aborigines as guides. As it is not possible for the average artist to travel to these places, he must depend on the museums. Work studied there should be used with the technical knowledge of the trained artist. If this is done, there is a chance for Australia to have a national art – an art taken from its primitive peoples, the Australian aborigines; an art for Australia from Australians.63
Preston’s work attracted the interest of Sydney museum curator Fred McCarthy, who detailed his views in a letter to the artist in 1942:
I have been to see the display of your wood and masonite cuts several times, and I offer you the following comments for what they are worth and to acquaint you with my impressions of the work. Firstly, let me congratulate you on the ‘Fish,’ ‘Sturt’s Desert Pea,’ ‘Aboriginal Hunt,’ and ‘Bark Basket’ prints – they strike the right note in colour, and in them you have achieved a remarkably effective combination of the methods and idiom of the aborigines. The colouring appeals to me because of its clear cut masses, bands,



Collecting, Recording and Preserving 175
etc., an arrangement which is the keynote of the work of aboriginal artists. For this reason I do not consider ‘Aboriginal Design’ to be as successful as the others; the composition is excellent, but the colour scheme is too light and therefore loses the spirit of aboriginal work. I have, however, discussed it with various friends and most of them liked it very much indeed. My only other criticism is that the decorative designs on the vases might be made more definite – the aborigine rarely makes a few meaningless strokes in his decorative work but always applies a definite pattern or design as the symbol of his secret and religious life and to imbue the object with the magical power of his ancestors. It is on these vases, clubs and weapons, table-covers, etc., in your work that the geometrical designs should be shown, and thus combined with the flowers from the same area. Thus Sturt’s Desert Pea should go with concentric circle and allied motives [sic], the zigzag with the Western Australian wildflowers, and the bright patterns of north-east Queensland with jungle flowers. In this connection, I might mention an idea that occurred to me is the combination of Christmas Bells and Christmas Bush flowers, concentric diamonds, etc. in a field of herring-bones and parallel lines on the vase, and some outline rock engravings – men hunting kangaroos or emus – on the table cover; such a combination would represent the flowers and aboriginal art of the Sydney area, that is, the Hawkesbury sandstone district.64
McCarthy envisaged that western art based on Aboriginal forms should seek to resemble the Aboriginal styles and forms as closely as possible, not merely evoke a kind of Aboriginality in a western artistic response.
‘I have saved the art from oblivion’: Mountford and the meaning of Aboriginal art
One of several prolific writers on Aboriginal art was Charles Mountford, the Adelaide writer and photographer who would later lead the



176 Writing Heritage
American–Australian Expedition to Arnhem Land. Like many, Mountford was particularly interested in seeking the ‘meaning’ of the rock paintings and other art works that he saw and collected. He had worked on seeking the meaning to art in Central Australia in the 1940s, and had a strong sense of his proprietary interests in Aboriginal art. His claims to authority are clear in the following correspondence with Towle in early November 1942:
I am still concentrating on the art of the people – in spite of papers on stone implements, and found striking differences between sacred, secular and magical art. Altogether, I have probably collected now about 1700 sheets of crayon drawings of aborigines, from Western Australia to Alice Springs in a strip east and west. Goodness only knows when they will be published, but at any rate I have saved the art from oblivion. I wish, that, by some strange chance, I could find out as much about the art of Arnhem Land, but then I am becoming greedy.65
This comment foreshadows Mountford’s visit to Arnhem Land as leader of the 1948 expedition, and illustrates his sense of selfimportance. Mountford nonetheless drew the admiration of Towle who replied to him later in November 1942:
You are most fortunate in having the opportunity of finding out the meaning of the art of some of the Central tribes. There is no doubt that investigators in South Australia are doing the best all-round work. There is far too much sameness about the work done by the purely social anthropologists. Much of the interest has gone out of that sort of work. We want to know much more about the aborigines in many other ways and you in South Australia are doing this wider kind of work. In this state, we cannot, of course, find out anything about the meaning of the art, but I have been surprised at the wide area over which rock paintings occur. I am sure I am correct in stating that they occur over practically half the area of the state.66



Collecting, Recording and Preserving 177
While Mountford was promoting his own work on ‘saving the art from oblivion’, others continued to keenly collect stone tools and discuss the meaning of these objects, often from entrenched positions within their own discipline or experience.
‘Our ways of approach are quite different’: Stone tool collectors and the problem of stratigraphy
The competition and rivalry, and authority claims that filled the letters, notebooks and diaries of Europeans who wrote on Aboriginal culture and heritage, seemed most evident among those who worked on material culture. The discipline of archaeology gave increasing prominence to depth and stratigraphy in determining antiquity, and this in turn provided a stimulus for further debates between collectors. Correspondence between these collectors suggests that these issues – antiquity, chronology and the role of archaeology became the bases upon which they could continue to assert their claims of authority and expertise over one another. One of the debates was between those who argued for the importance of stratigraphy and chronology in determining stone tool antiquity – that is, those supporting the role of archaeology and those who denied this historical approach and continued to advocate surface collecting. Among the protagonists in this debate were Leonhard Adam, Fred McCarthy and Stan Mitchell. Adam, who was ethnologist at Melbourne University and had worked on some of the stone implements kept at the National Museum of Victoria, criticised Mitchell’s denial of stratigraphy in a long letter to McCarthy in 1945:
As you remember, I have been engaged for some time in studying the uniface and semi-uniface pebbles, especially of Victoria, in this museum. Although specimens are not yet easily available, it is a little better now that at least some of the walls of books which had been built round the stone cases have been removed. I think



178 Writing Heritage
conditions will improve for the following reason: Mr S. R. Mitchell, who is honorary Mineralogist and Metallurgist for the museum, told me that he was going to write a book of his own on stone implements. Needless to say, his work will in no way make my own efforts pointless because our ways of approach are quite different, and Mitchell, with his profound knowledge of the materials of which stone implements are made seems to be convinced that stratigraphic and this historical research is hopeless – a view with which both of us, ie you and I do not agree.67
Adam also had some comments to make on the finding of some previously uncatalogued collections of stone implements, and on the role of ‘amateur’ collectors, as he detailed to McCarthy:
... Mitchell the other day ‘discovered’ a number of boxes and cases containing stone implements from Victorian sites which had not even been catalogued, although they have been in the museum vaults for years. Very interesting is the fact that, among those implements, all brought together by amateur collectors, and at least partly labelled (I fancy, only partly), there are types from localities which offer nothing of those kinds nowadays.68
Adam complained that the activities of these ‘amateurs’ had negative consequences for ‘serious research’:
For example, all the ground axes of Altona have been taken away by ‘collectors’ of that ridiculous type, so that you would not be able to find a single specimen to-day. But here, in these ‘excavated’ trays, you can see some of them – the others are in the possession of a retired schoolmaster in Altona. Then I saw pieces from Keilor which turns out to have been hunting ground for ‘collectors’ for a long time before it became famous through the skull. ... I think I can now assert that all the known localities in southern Victoria have been spoilt for serious research by the amateurs.69
This correspondence gives some indication of the play of rivalries as professional ethnologists Adam and McCarthy criticised the



Collecting, Recording and Preserving 179
amateurs over technique and method in collecting, classifying and cataloguing.
Charles Barrett’s traveller’s tale
While debates and rivalries continued between amateur and professional, the steady stream of writings by those ‘amateurs’ nonetheless produced a more popular, accessible kind of discourse, and played an important role in reaching a wider audience. Like Croll, Melbourne naturalist and popular writer Charles Barrett used the metaphor of ‘hunting’ in his description about the search for artifacts. This metaphor invites parallels with other pursuits such as the safari, or the drive to capture and kill. Barrett’s eager prose captures this metaphor well in this 1941 account of a journey he made through northern Australia:
We should have good hunting on the Wessels. Meanwhile, at Yirrkala there was plenty of work for a naturalist and dabbler in ethnology. Mobs of it. We took scores of photographs every day; added to our various collections; returning, all hot and bothered, to the mission house – to be cooled down by iced lemonade.70
This passage also invokes again the connection between the discourses of natural history and ethnology, echoing the writings of earlier people such as Dahl and Wilkins. Elsewhere in his book, again reminiscent of the earlier work of Croll, Barrett’s prose conjures up a sad discourse on the ‘dying race’ theme as he wistfully mourns the demise of Aboriginal culture in all its manifestations:
Before the end of this century, the Wessel Island group of aborigines will be as a tale that is told; but their works, rock paintings in the caves, will survive, to lure unborn scientists to lonely isles of the Arafura Sea; unless vandals deface them, as they have defaced ancient native drawings on rock in the dead heart of Australia.71



180 Writing Heritage
From collecting to classifying
Another theme that was subject to a continuing interest to writers was the classification of material culture. Many European–Australians had, from the early part of the century, sought patterns and trends in material culture, and to devise systematic classificatory schemes for the ever-growing collections of stone and other artifacts. In 1946 Fred McCarthy, with Elsie Bramell and H. V. V. Noone, published a small volume on material culture called The Stone Implements of Australia.72 In contrast to the vivid, racy prose of popular works such as that of Barrett, this work sets out in an impersonal and detached way the authors’ scheme for classification of Australian stone implements. The paper began by declaring its purpose:
The study of Australian stone implements has advanced steadily during the past twenty years. At present, however, the position has been reached in which there exist [sic] a certain amount of confusion regarding typology and nomenclature and a lack of knowledge among those interested, both here and abroad, of the full range of Australian implement types and their variations. This work is a systematic study intended to clarify these aspects of the subject as far as possible.73
This statement has a tone reminiscent of the ‘filling the gaps’ approach common in many writings on material culture and ethnology. The authors place their study in the context of previous work, stating that a classification based solely on one factor, such as function, is inadequate. Instead, they sought to adopt a broader basis to classification that considered a range of other aspects, including diffusion. McCarthy, Bramell and Noone, invoking the kinds of concern with nomenclature raised by earlier writers such as Roth, outlined some of the problems of naming stone implements:



Collecting, Recording and Preserving 181
A matter of great importance to the development of the study of Australian stone implements is that a system of nomenclature must be established, and furthermore, it must be one by which all workers abide.74
In acknowledging the difficulties in nomenclature, they asserted that ‘the naming of an implement is not an easy task’ and claimed that ‘its characteristics must be defined and illustrated in order to demonstrate that the implement is a specialized type’. Elaborating on this, they wrote:
A name stands for a set of characteristics and is preferable, where possible, to an unwieldy phrase. ... It is advisable to adopt the name given by a tribe to an implement where it is known, otherwise to use the name of a tribe in whose territory a type is first recorded or in which it is particularly abundant, or the aboriginal name of a type locality.
With this in mind, they stated that their aim was ‘to establish an Australian terminology’, and detailed the reasoning for this view:
We do not regard Australian implements as a group apart from all others, for in fact similarities and relationships between Australia and neighbouring regions have been shown to exist, but we wish to avoid the confusion that will arise from the use of terms which may have a different connotation in other countries. ... We are of the opinion, generally speaking, that Australian implements and cultures should be given a local terminology, a policy which tends to promote greater care in their comparison with those of other countries.75
The importance placed by these writers on naming stone implements according to their local characteristics was to become particularly relevant in the following decades, with growing recognition of the role of Aboriginal people in defining and controlling their cultural heritage.

‘Made to Order’: Arnhem Land 1948
During the following decades, the Northern Territory region of Arnhem Land gained the increasing attention of Europeans. This region was considered by many observers and writers to be the place where Aboriginal people were still living what was thought to be a ‘traditional’ lifestyle. Arnhem Land had long been a focus for natural history, ethnographic and scientific expeditions. As a Commonwealth territory it was also subject to increasing scrutiny by administrators as they further developed the Commonwealth government’s machinery of control. In 1948 an expedition was formed to ‘investigate the ethnology, art and legends of the aborigines of Arnhem Land and adjacent areas of the Northern Territory of Australia’.1 The expedition members comprised a multi-disciplinary team of ethnologists, archaeologists, natural scientists and nutritionists, as well as photographers and support personnel. This joint American–Australian expedition led by Charles Mountford was to become a major event both in terms of the contributions it made to knowledge of this region and as a result of the writings produced by it. It resulted in a voluminous literature comprising official records of the expedition and various journal articles as well as a considerable amount of private correspondence, journals and other private documents. The expedition



‘Made to Order’ 183
also resulted in large collections of ethnographic objects and natural science materials, and in extensive collections of photographs, audio and film records. The ethnographic collections – in particular, bark paintings – were the subject of some controversy regarding their eventual locations, and the politics of their division between several different collecting institutions.2 One source that provides a good picture of the day-to-day activities of the expedition is the diary of American archaeologist Frank M. Setzler, the expedition’s deputy leader.3 Setzler’s reflections and comments in his diary provide an important contribution to our knowledge of the history of anthropology and archaeology in Australia, and to other disciplines such as the history of Aboriginal art and ethnographic collecting. Although Setzler was the expedition’s archaeologist, he also comments on other areas of the work, such as the recording of sacred sites. In describing some of the approaches of the expedition in obtaining information about such sites, Setzler’s remarks raise important issues about the nature of ethnographic fieldwork, relations with Indigenous informants, and considerations about ethics and authenticity in fieldwork. Setzler departed for Australia in late January 1948. Before travelling to Arnhem Land to commence the work of the expedition, he visited Adelaide, Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne for meetings and publicity activities. Arriving in Canberra on 25 February he met Arthur Calwell, Minister of Immigration and Information, whom he described as:
a most delightful politician with a sharp tongue, quick wit, and keen mind. He has red hair and talks out of the side of his mouth.4
Setzler was favourably impressed by Canberra, describing it as:
a beautifully planned town consisting now of wide open spaces and millions of trees and flowering shrubs from all over the world. There are so many trees you cannot see the low buildings.5



184 Writing Heritage
Eventually arriving at Arnhem Land in April, he wrote of the contrast between his preconceived image of ‘wild’ Aborigines and the people he saw there:
It is quite obvious that the so-called wild Australian aborigines of Arnhem Land are non-existent. The people over practically all of Arnhem Land live either at the missions or work at the various cattle stations.6
This comment illustrates the dichotomy, found in some Europeans’ writings, between their preconceived images of Aborigines and their subsequent observations based on experience and later reflection. The expedition made its first base at the settlement of Umbakumba, in the northeast corner of Groote Eylandt, from 14 April until 8 July 1948. The next station visited was Yirrkala, where they stayed from 9 July to 9 September. From 2 to 20 August they conducted excavations at Milingimbi Island. Finally, the group stayed at Oenpelli from mid-September until departing Arnhem Land on 2 November.7 There were some delays in starting the expedition’s work, and Setzler, who was keen to ‘find’ some archaeological sites, recorded his frustration shortly after arriving at Umbakumba in April, complaining that ‘we still haven’t found an archaeological site, but right now it is a question of making our food last’.8 By May, he was still worried about this delay and wrote:
Here it is almost 6 weeks since we left Darwin, and the entire group has not yet got together. Our equipment is only the scantiest that could be brought in the Catalina [supply vessel], and our food supply is always running low. My own disappointment is the delay in getting on an archaeological site. Thus far I’ve gotten 20 good bark paintings for the U.S.N.M. [United States National Museum], lots of notes and photos of their material culture.9



‘Made to Order’ 185
This extract raises an interesting question about the perceived nature of archaeological sites: in one sense, it could be said such sites are not simply ‘found’, but instead are ‘made’ as a result of the archaeologists’ excavation. Eventually in June, accompanied by Fred McCarthy, Setzler managed to carry out some archaeological work. The archaeologists were seeking, among other things, evidence of the presence of Malays or Macassans who traded with and visited Aboriginal communities in the north for many centuries before European contact. Setzler described one such site:
We looked over the Macassar site ... it seems to consist of blocks of ironstone, or trevertine, on the surface, black midden layer, and one introduced item brought in by the Malays from the town of Makassa in the Celebes, namely the tamarind tree. There is a regular grove of these lovely trees along the beach.10
For Setzler, the objective was to find something of significance, and he complained at one stage about the lack of any worthwhile ‘finds’:
... About 4.00 PM we began some long trenches back of our camp in what might be called shell mounds. ... These trenches extended across 3 depressions, but nothing of abo stone work or even Malay pottery was found. Slim pickings!11
A desire to find something: archaeology in Arnhem Land
A discourse of ‘first discovery’ permeates Setzler’s account, as he moaned on 7 June 1948:
... except for exploring the island, our archaeological work was finished. One might dig in these shallow shell heaps for weeks in the hope of finding a ground stone ax or even a metal Malay ax or



186 Writing Heritage
stone knife or mortar. Certainly the long trenches we had put in yesterday gave no promise of finding things.12
A telling moment occurred during a hot October day while excavating at a cave site at Oenpelli. Setzler described the scene:
Another hot day. By the time we reach the cave we feel as though we’ve done a day’s work. ... In the second screen load appeared a well-made ground and polished stone ax. ... This is the first complete stone ax we have found in a cave deposit. Too bad we didn’t get it yesterday when the photographers were present.13
Here the lens of the camera is ever present, ready to show proof of experience and to establish validity and authority. Setzler is clearly becoming more confident of the archaeological work, and there is even greater glory yet to come. He continues his description of that October day:
About an hour later, Mickey called my attention [to] a rough looking piece of wood sticking out of the vertical wall of our trench at a depth of 18 inches. I troweled off the upper layer and when we brought it out into the sunlight I realised that we had recovered a highly-prized specimen. On the one end of the stick was a wellformed lump of wax or cement fashioned at an acute angle to the handle. At the end of this cement was the tip end of a quartzite scraper with the customary high polish. Here then was the actual method of hafting these quartzite scrapers which we had been finding by the hundreds. Too bad McCarthy was not present. However, I’ll try to get him to express his views concerning the method of hafting these scrapers and then show him the real thing. ... This was a thrilling day. It was a pay-off for six weeks of dirty, hot cave digging.14
Setzler’s enthusiasm and clear excitement at these finds shines through his diary. The intimate, personal style captures the ‘moment of discovery’. He wishes his colleague Fred McCarthy had been



‘Made to Order’ 187
present – to perhaps share in the excitement – possibly a comment on rare collegial collaboration. The narrative of the ‘discovery’ of the hafted axe so intimately described by Setzler in his diary was transformed a few years later into an impersonal, seamless scientific statement with the publication by Setzler and McCarthy of this find in the Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences (1950). The tone in this article is relatively restrained, as the authors wrote:
On October 26 and 27, 1948, within a few days prior to the closing of the Arnhem Land Expedition camp at Oenpelli, we had the good fortune to recover the hafted adz and blade described and illustrated here.15
In the shift in the description of an item of material culture from private into public discourse, the excited rhetoric of first discovery is smoothed, cleansed of hyperbole, and given the certainty and authority required by the discipline (archaeology, in this case). Yet the private discourses on this Oenpelli implement continued to course through other writings, appearing again not long before the Setzler and McCarthy paper was published. In 1950 Fred McCarthy wrote to various colleagues about the hafted axe and Setzler’s ‘discovery’. He explained to botanist Ray Specht his views on the manuscript for the Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences paper sent to him by Setzler:
... I haven’t heard from Setzler for some time. He sent me several pages of M. on the hafted adze but they were so bad that I simply discarded them and re-wrote the complete paper, giving him ‘senior’ authorship (which he inserted into the text) because he found the implement.16
Here the sense of harmonious, collegial collaboration implied in the published article is undermined by the discord evident in McCarthy’s complaint. In another letter, this time to former



188 Writing Heritage
Arnhem Land colleague, photographer Peter Bassett-Smith, McCarthy elaborates on his disquiet over Setzler’s claims to having ‘discovered’ the stone axe at Oenpelli:
... I am glad you found the paper on the hafted adze of interest. As a matter of fact, Frank sent me the original manuscript and really you could never, or perhaps you could now, imagine how inadequate and superficial it was – the whole point brought out in it was the tremendous, amazing, astounding value of the discovery by Frank M. Setzler of such a unique implement. I just wiped the whole thing and wrote what was printed – even then Frank altered one or two things, such as inserting senior author in place of one of us which is the usual custom in these papers ...17
This indicates something of a process of sanitisation that occurred to transform what was Setzler’s ebullience over his ‘discovery’ of the stone axe, into a muted, scientific account of the find. But in depersonalising the account, McCarthy has also sought to erase Setzler’s claims to having been the one to find the implement. This produces a stark discourse of ‘ownership’ of heritage, and of contested claims to authority and possession of a discipline, as played out through its textual representations. These authority claims of expedition members McCarthy and Setzler also flowed through into other writings, as they all but dismissed earlier archaeological work by Lloyd Warner in their summary of archaeology published in 1960 in the expedition’s records.
Warner’s Arnhem Land
Although Setzler and McCarthy wrote authoritatively about their ethnological and archaeological work, they were not the ‘first in the field’ in this region. Their writings contain references to earlier work by Lloyd Warner, whose fieldwork in the 1920s, and 1937 monograph were important reference points for the 1948 expedition. In



‘Made to Order’ 189
Setzler’s brief diary note on arriving at Milingimbi on 30 July, he recorded that he had ‘examined shell heaps ... [and] identified Warner’s 1926 and 1927 trench’. But there is a contradiction between the 1948 expedition’s work, and the writings produced from it. Although in practice Warner’s work was clearly an important reference point for that expedition, in their published works flowing from the expedition Setzler and McCarthy had all but dismissed the earlier archaeologist’s work. However, in Warner’s record of his own work, his excavation in Arnhem Land in the 1920s assumes a greater importance than is conveyed by Setzler and McCarthy’s references. In his account of his excavation at Milingimbi, in the country of the Murngin, Warner proclaimed his interest in stone axes and wrote that he ‘made a fairly large collection of them’.18 He explained the purpose of his excavation in studying this axe:
Because the axe is stone and durable it gives one a good opportunity to use archaeological methods to study its approximate age in Murngin culture and possibly Australian civilization ... Two of these Milingimbi mounds were excavated by the writer with the help of aboriginal labor and mission picks and shovels. ... The largest mound was located about one hundred yards or so from the shore and was shaped like the crater of a volcano with a rock water hole in its depths.19
His work yielded a find that he thought significant:
A ground stone axe was found within six inches from the bottom, or eight feet beneath the surface. This seemed to indicate a great antiquity for this implement in this area and therefore at least for its appearance in Australia. The finding of this axe was the most important positive contribution made by the two mounds that were excavated, since it was a positive proof of the long use of this artifact in north Australia.20



190 Writing Heritage
While Warner had established the authority of discovery, Setzler and McCarthy rendered his work relatively insignificant in a paper published in 1960 in the records of that expedition. Here, describing their archaeological work carried out on the 1948 expedition, these writers claim:
Except for the minor excavations by Warner during his two seasons of ethnological field work on Milingimbi Island in 1927–28, no other controlled excavations had been undertaken up to this time in the northern portion of Arnhem Land.21
The claims to authority and the possession of specialist knowledge or experience in the McCarthy–Setzler writings permeate much of the discourse produced by the 1948 Arnhem Land expedition. These proprietary claims are a significant aspect not only of Europeans’ attitudes to Aboriginal cultures, but also as expressed in their writings. Such claims were used to validate their ‘expertise’ and maintain authority over knowledge and disciplines.
Archaeology and culture sequence
In Setzler and McCarthy’s 1960 published summary of archaeology, they emphasise the absence of archaeological materials, stating that ‘as might be expected, the archaeological material is relatively sparse and is limited almost entirely to the non-perishable chipped stone and bone implements’. This, they claim, created some difficulties in establishing the ‘prehistory’ of the people in this area:
The relative paucity of artifacts in most of the sites excavated increases the difficulty of reconstructing the prehistory of a people whose descendants still subsist on a hunting-gathering-fishing cultural level.22
Items used by present day Aboriginal peoples, these writers argued, did not provide a direct insight into past uses:



‘Made to Order’ 191
A wide variety of perishable specimens, ceremonial as well as utilitarian, are used by the living aborigines, but on the basis of our archaeological specimens alone, it would be impossible to determine the type of spears, spear-throwers, drone-tubes, clap or music-sticks, baskets, bags, wooden receptacles, bark paintings, carved wooden figures, the multitude of ceremonial paraphernalia, types of houses, or clothes used by the ancestors of these living natives. Yet these people – with the exception of those living round the missions probably differ very little in their material culture, their economic or ceremonial life from their ancestors who lived in this territory a thousand or more years ago.23
This extract suggests that the writers maintained a denial of change and innovation in Aboriginal culture. Employing the familiar theme of absence, Setzler and McCarthy commented on the paucity of objects found through their archaeological work. They expressed surprise at the ‘distinct contrast between the scanty, non-perishable objects recovered by archaeologists and the multitude and variety of perishable objects used by these primitive men’, and concluded that the Aborigines had advanced little in their material culture. Like many of their predecessors and contemporaries, McCarthy and Setzler bemoaned the difficulties of studying a ‘people without pottery’, stating that ‘the authors often wished that the prehistoric Australians had reached the stage of manufacturing pottery’.24 Here, the apparent paucity of material ‘evidence’ is constructed not in terms of the vagaries and unevenness of the archaeological record, but as an attribute of lack in the Aboriginal people themselves.
Classification and archaeology
The Arnhem Land Expedition and its writings highlight the continuing debate among Europeans concerning cultural affinities and classification of Aboriginal cultures. McCarthy used the Arnhem Land work as an opportunity to modify his classification of Abori



192 Writing Heritage
ginal prehistoric stone cultures to include local developments that he labelled as ‘Oenpellian’ and ‘Milingimbian’.25 The Sydney-based ethnologist was known for his tendency to draw wide comparisons between cultures in different parts of Australia, and in other parts of the world. Mulvaney and Kamminga state that in McCarthy’s earlier work, he ‘was prone to correlate far-flung examples of prehistoric artifacts, just as Tindale had done, but he proved to be more flexible in framing his cultural phases and in his use of terminology’.26 McCarthy’s broad comparative approach had earlier been criticised by Towle, writing to Kenyon in 1941:
Why does McCarthy write so much? Why does he not think more? I am afraid that much of his work is slapdash. Recently I received a copy of his paper dealing with the comparison of the prehistory of Australia with that of Indo-China, Malay and Netherlands East Indies. In it he makes statements which could only be expected from an armchair writer. From his pen theory follows theory. After all, what is their value unless they are based on solid fact?27
Criticising McCarthy’s approach to culture sequence, Towle wrote that McCarthy had ‘thrown caution to the winds’, as he explained to Kenyon:
He [McCarthy] went to Indo-China and other places nearby, and came home crammed full of theories about inter-relationships .... I suppose that if McCarthy had gone to India, he would have come home with theories about prehistoric India and Australia having been related ... One does not question McCarthy’s sincerity and industry, but his paper is an undigested conglomeration of statements. I fail to find in it any real appreciation of the difficulties confronting us with respect to Australian archaeology.28
Towle’s criticism of the ‘theorising’ of McCarthy might have been motivated by a wish to promote the work of people like himself and other amateurs who worked outside the academies and research institutions. As he outlined to Kenyon, ‘what we want in Australia is



‘Made to Order’ 193
a body of scientific workers independent of Museums and Universities, with sufficient knowledge and influence to deal with all such theories on their merits ...’.29
Made to order: collecting art and culture
As well as archaeological work, many of the Arnhem Land expedition’s activities were focused on collecting ‘art and culture’. Much of Setzler’s diary records the daily process of acquiring objects, and he maintains a steady critique of the ways in which these were produced ‘on demand’. He wrote on 21 April at Groote Eylandt, shortly after arrival in Arnhem Land, while waiting for an opportunity to carry out some archaeological work:
The natives are carrying on with the making of bark paintings and the making of spears, baskets, etc. It is unfortunate that these natives have to be told what to make, rather than our collecting the paraphernalia of their material culture.30
The Aborigines were producing cultural items ‘on demand’, on the basis of descriptions in Warner’s ethnography, as Setzler described on 12 July:
We’ve got 12 natives working on bark paintings and material cultural objects, having prepared a list from Warner’s book.31
A few days later, on 15 July, he again referred to the 1920s fieldwork of Warner as he commented:
McCarthy is feeling better and is checking types of material culture as reported by Warner. He will carry forward the directions for making those specimens. It all seems backwards, but that is our only method for obtaining ethnological specimens.32
Setzler also remarks on the use of trade goods for cultural objects, as he noted for 3 August:



194 Writing Heritage
At noon we showed our trade objects to Tom – razor blades, combs, and mirrors. We seem agreed to trade this stuff for ethnological specimens.33
This trade moved at a brisk pace:
... Native boys brought 3 woomeras, 2 stone spear points hafted, 2 steel shovel spears, 2 stone spear points unhafted, a basket, and polished ax head. Bought all of them for a stick of native tobacco a piece. Big business.34
As the trade continues, Setzler provides a critique of this method of procuring cultural objects:
Continued excavations at the ‘Well’. Wrote my notes, marked archaeological specimens. Am constantly disturbed by the natives bringing us ethnological specimens, for which we trade them tobacco. They are not interested in anything else. They will do most anything for you. Have purchased or traded one stick of tobacco for a spear, or a basket, etc. Many specimens coming in are not those made to order – so to speak – but the actual specimens which they use in their everyday life. This turns out by far the best procedure to purchase or trade the things of their culture we desire, rather than get the objects they actually use. This is a more orthodox way of collecting, I feel.35
Here again, we meet this discourse of ‘authenticity’ examined in the context of collecting cultural items. Setzler’s use of the term ‘orthodox’ to denote the method of acquiring cultural objects is curious. His expressed preference for the ‘things of their culture we desire’ over ‘the objects they actually use’ reinforces the artificiality of the collecting practised here, with its focus on prescribing what objects should be made. Setzler’s comment appears to be more a rhetorical device intended to justify the rather rigorously imposed demands placed by the Europeans for the production of Aboriginal



‘Made to Order’ 195
artifacts, than it was an observation on the strategy of ethnographic collecting. As with the performance of ceremonies described by many ethnographers, the production of cultural objects was also conducted, in part, for the Europeans. These objects, once manufactured, entered into Europeans’ domains and underwent successive journeys and transformations to become ethnological curiosities displayed in museums and private collections. Many would also eventually be classified as ‘art’ for mass consumption in galleries and boardrooms. The term ‘specimen’ used by Setzler belongs more to a discourse of science than of ethnography – a stark pointer to ethnography’s earlier incarnation as ‘ethnology’, and its links with science and natural history. Specimens are samples that people obtain in order to form a collection to demonstrate certain ideas, or to study for various characteristics and properties. The members of the Arnhem Land expedition saw their collection of cultural objects as having been obtained variously through trade, and by specially commissioning items. However, to the Aboriginal people the proffering of items such as bark paintings to Europeans was at times likely to have been motivated by other concerns, such as social and political ones, as anthropologist Howard Morphy points out. In his study of the art of the Yolngu people of Arnhem Land, Morphy argues that art played a vital role in mediating between Yolngu and Europeans:
Works of art were commodities, but they were also a means of widening Australians’ understanding of Aboriginal culture, in hopes of redressing the imbalance of propaganda or adverse publicity ...36
Morphy describes the process by which ‘Yolngu ... became aware of the connection between artifact and advocacy’, stating that:
... it is certain that by the mid-1950s Yolngu had begun to appreciate the value of their art as a means of both asserting cultural



196 Writing Heritage
identity and attempting to get Europeans to negotiate with them on their own terms.37
‘The natives are starving for tobacco’
Setzler also had some opinions on the role of the mission in maintaining a supply of tobacco to the Aboriginal people, thus creating demand. He wrote on 6 August:
Continued excavations ... Natives come from all over the mainland in order to trade here. Mission seems to function on the basis that when they have sufficient food for the natives, they’ll hire about 40 out of about 150. ... Their tobacco is also rationed to one stick on Monday and one stick on Friday, for which the natives are starving for tobacco. The Mission would like to eradicate the habit of smoking, but thus far has had no success. As a result, they’ll sell their souls for a stick of tobacco, and we have been able to buy hundreds of their daily used objects for the few pounds of tobacco we have with us.38
His entry for 7 August continued this theme:
Traded with natives after breakfast until 9.00 A.M. Traded for more specimens when we came home. Those natives surely love their tobacco. ... Need cash and more tobacco if we want some of the good specimens available here.39
Setzler’s comments on tobacco echo remarks by earlier writers such as the Norwegian visitor, Dahl, who had recorded his observations in 1925:
These tobacco-hunting loafers were just the right people for my purpose. For a small payment in tobacco they would bring me all the ordinary animals which were to be found in the neighbourhood. No sooner had I made my trading intentions public than daily we were besieged at the door of our ‘museum’ by people who wanted to barter away for tobacco everything, from their day’s bag of



‘Made to Order’ 197
animals to their arms and ornaments. For tobacco they would sell or do anything, and I could easily have found individuals who, for a stick of tobacco, would not have hesitated to kill their own grandmothers.40
Tobacco was very often used as a trade good by Europeans, as a means for engaging with Aborigines, and in transactions over cultural performances and material objects. However, the resulting demand for tobacco that was created in Aboriginal societies led to a pejorative discourse in many Europeans’ writings.
Finding rock art
While archaeological sites were apparently few, during the Arnhem Land expedition there were seemingly rich finds of rock art sites, as Setzler noted:
... About 6.00 p.m. Fred McCarthy and Korpitja came aboard, having had a very successful afternoon finding a low rock ledge back of Amalipa with hundreds of paintings of animals, birds, fish, canoes, abos fishing and spearing turtle and dugongs from canoes, all in red ochre.41
The delight apparent in this description is also evident in Fred McCarthy’s writing as he related his work in recording cave paintings at Chasm Island, off Groote Eylandt, on 29 June:
This was a longed for & enjoyable experience ... because of the existence on the island of the first rock paintings reported in Australia by Flinders in 1802–3, which I had the great privilege of recording. It houses a great number of sites, of which I recorded 25 or so, & did not see those at the eastern end described briefly by Tindale. I also found a new colour, a rich brown dry pigment, in aboriginal art, & lightly pecked rock engravings, the first reported in Arnhem Land. My inspiring visit to the great cavern in which the frieze of large porpoises and turtles is situated was a memorable one,



198 Writing Heritage
& must have been like that of the discoverer of a new cave in western Europe.42
This extract from McCarthy’s diary exudes pride in ‘first discovery’ as he revels in having followed in the tracks of Matthew Flinders some 145 years earlier.
‘I’ve been able to get some good pictures’: creating a visual record
One of the many objectives of the Arnhem Land expedition was to obtain a visual record of Aboriginal art and culture. Setzler maintains a record of the constant presence of camera and film. On 17 June he noted the steady production of various cultural objects and reflected on having secured photographs of this process:
... While I was in charge of camp I’ve had the natives working on canoe paddles, special spear throwers, and spears. I’ve been able to get some good pictures showing the process of manufacture, from original log, through the various stages, to the finished painted implement, all on one film.43
Setzler’s boast here is consistent with the claims of ‘first discovery’ in that it establishes the writer’s authority over all that he has seen and recorded. These proud claims of accomplishment in collecting and recording are elements of the process of colonisation, demonstrations of the power of the coloniser as observer, collector and administrator. The all-seeing eye of the camera stands witness to Setzler’s proud mastery over Aboriginal culture, producing the permanent record so often desired by observers of that culture. As was Aiston some years earlier, so too were members of the 1948 Arnhem Land expedition keen to see and record Aboriginal cultural performances, and they intervened in various ways to help bring such performances about. In late June Setzler comments on



‘Made to Order’ 199
one performance that was carried out at the instigation of the Europeans, and on the filming of that performance:
... How many dances were not put on that would have been used in their regular dance held at [?] we shall never know. One thing is certain and that is that no other Australian native dance ceremony has ever been recorded on cine film in color as this artificial corroboree has been.44
He elaborates on his use of the term ‘artificial’:
I say ‘artificial’ because all of it was put on for the benefit of the cameras. It would have been far better anthropologically if we could have been bystanders or photographers recording the dances and other activities during one of their annual dance ceremonies held at the regular sacred dance ground, Amalipa, during the fall when the natives provide their own food, instead of large tins of flour and other commodities supplied by Mountford. However, this film record is better than none.45
This scenario is again reminiscent of Aiston’s attempts described earlier to ‘choreograph’ a corroboree. Like Aiston, Setzler also has anxieties about the spatial and temporal requirements of the corroboree. The ever present nostalgia for some presumed ‘authentic’ culture is prominent in this writing as well, in Setzler’s comment on what kind of performance would have been ‘far better anthropologically’.
‘The difficulty with archaeology’
Setzler’s forthright opinions were not confined to the making of cultural objects and the filming and photographing of performances. He also had some firm views on the nature of Australian archaeology. In August he recorded that McCarthy had found some ‘large chert flakes along an outcropping of the beach’. Although McCarthy insisted that what he had found was an ‘old chipping site’, Setzler



200 Writing Heritage
thought otherwise, writing that ‘I told Fred I wouldn’t consider it as such because it looked like too large flakes which were likely made by other forces than by primitive man’. One of the local Aboriginal people present at the time, Miangala, ‘finally told Fred this was the place he had broken up the rocks in order to make a fish trap which he showed us in the bay’. While McCarthy ‘still tried to insist on its being an old flaking site’, Setzler ‘cautioned him against using such evidence’. This debate prompted Setzler to declare that ‘the difficulty with archaeology in Australia is that they have only stone points for artifacts, and therefore analyze them to the “nth” degree’.46 Setzler offers further reflections on the nature of archaeological work in Australia. On 23 September – two days after his 46th birthday – he described excavations at a rock shelter at Oenpelli, observing that ‘the specimens were few and far between, but when we completed the operation; we had everything man-made’. This combination of paucity of ‘specimens’ and the seeming difficulty in finding ‘explanations’ for what was found led Setzler to reflect:
Since these aborigines, as is true of all Australian cultures, were nomadic, their range of specimens is quite small. It therefore becomes necessary to examine carefully every stone that could have been used for chipping purposes. Moreover, the archaeologists here in Australia go into the minutest description of their chipped stone specimens.47
This suggestion of Australian archaeology as being somehow minimalist again reinforces the notion of lack that was prevalent in Europeans’ discourses on Indigenous heritage.
Recording sites
The Arnhem Land expedition members also had an interest in documenting and recording significant Aboriginal sites. In an entry



‘Made to Order’ 201
for Tuesday, 8 June, Setzler narrates the process by which Mountford (‘Monty’) sought information from Aboriginal guides about totemic sites. As the expedition leader questioned the guides, Banju and Charlie, Setzler takes up the story:
... Another and more serious aspect of the totemic sites consists in Monty’s pushing Banju and Charlie to tell him the significance of each natural formation. One of the boat boys overheard Banju and Charlie talking together and deciding among themselves to call a certain rock formation jutting out at a point on Bickerton the ‘Baylor totem’. No one can convince Monty that a lot of the stuff they give him is rubbish in order to get their tobacco!!48
This extract captures some of the tensions between the Europeans and Aborigines, and suggests an Aboriginal response to what was likely to have been persistent questioning by the expedition members. The passage conjures a notion of Mountford’s gullibility, but at the same time also portrays the Aborigines in a pejorative way as people whose lives were based almost entirely around the pursuit of tobacco and trade goods. We might also glean in this passage some sense though of Aborigines as active agents in the encounter – a palpable shift from the many writings in which these people were either silent, absent, or passive objects of Europeans’ gaze. Setzler’s diary invites many readings on the nature of the engagement between Aborigines and the expedition members. In the above extract the encounter appears to be informed by a sense of the Aborigines as either inherently unknowable, as materially demanding (for tobacco and other trade goods), or as tellers of untruths; while the Europeans (or at least Mountford) are portrayed as gullible. This depiction of European–Aboriginal engagement emphasises the processes of collecting and recording Aboriginal cultural heritage as much as the objects of that heritage.

‘Free from European Influence’
In the wake of the 1948 Arnhem Land expedition
Following the 1948 expedition to Arnhem Land, its participants maintained an interest in the region and engaged in correspondence about various matters relating to art, collections of bark paintings, and the publication of the expedition reports. In 1949 Fred McCarthy received a letter from Fred Gray, the superintendent of the settlement at Umbakumba on Groote Eylandt who had hosted the expedition there. Gray informed McCarthy about the continuing work of the Aboriginal artists:
... Recently a number of Caledon Bay natives have been down to make one of their visits and they included old Wongu, who was not, I believe at Yirrkala while you were there. It was rather a pity for he is a wonderful artist and is one of the few old men who really knows his stuff ...1
Gray’s comment illustrates the growing importance that Europeans attributed to individual Aboriginal artists, echoing the observations made earlier by Baldwin Spencer. McCarthy replied to Gray in 1950 expressing his interest in carrying out further work on Groote Eylandt:



‘Free from European Influence’ 203
... I heard from Fred Rose about Wongo [sic] and his crowd settling down at Umba Kumba. I would certainly like to get some of his bark paintings and if there is any possibility of getting a series please let me know the cost and I will try to arrange a deal. ... I suppose life on Groote has changed very little. ... I would like to spend two or three months on the island, now that I know what is there and the actual work that I would like to do. In particular, I would like to complete my recording of the cave paintings on Chasm ... I would also like to go over the bark problem painting work again – Monty tackled it in the wrong way and although he got a lot of interesting dope I am sure a much better series of paintings could be obtained.2
The artist Wongu (or Wonggu in alternative spellings) referred to in this correspondence had been ‘a leading figure in Yolngu resistance to European invasion’ and had been known to Fred Gray for a long time.3 McCarthy’s statement that ‘I am sure a much better series of paintings could be obtained’ indicates the kind of influence Europeans either had or desired in the production of Aboriginal art works. We are not informed as to what constituted ‘better’ paintings, though it is likely to have been a European judgement. McCarthy’s expressed wish to revisit the field and to do further work on recording rock art and collecting bark paintings epitomises his lifelong interest in intensive research and regional studies. He advanced this interest further in later years as Principal of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies.
Mountford and the National Geographic Magazine
The 1948 expedition generated voluminous writings, which included private diaries, journals and correspondence, as well as published reports and journal articles. Some members of the expedition also produced more popular accounts, some of which were published in the National Geographic Magazine, the journal of



204 Writing Heritage
one of the expedition’s sponsors. Mountford was particularly adept at popularising the expedition in print, photographs and films. His 1949 article ‘Exploring Stone Age Arnhem Land’ was written in a style typical of the National Geographic, with its emphasis on wonder and awe, evoking the romance of adventure.4 As such, the National Geographic provided a medium particularly suited to Mountford, whose own approach to the study and recording of Aboriginal culture was underpinned by a kind of naïve enthusiasm and entrenched view of Aborigines as remnants of ‘stone age man’. The opening sentence of his article – ‘A strange world below our plane unfolded like an ancient chart on weathered parchment’ – set the scene for a narrative that constructed Aborigines as essentially different, strange, other.5 Mountford’s prose echoes the kind of racialised narrative of much earlier writers, as he exoticises the Aborigines as quintessentially savage:
Often the aborigines hold an all-night corroboree (tribal song and dance), their painted bodies flashing grotesquely in the firelight. And sometimes their spears fly in a fight to the death over women.6
Detailing the various members of the Arnhem Land expedition and their tasks, Mountford described his own role:
As ethnologist, my special interest was in primitive art. Through the kind cooperation of Fred Gray, I had at my disposal several aboriginal artists from his settlement. On bark they painted legendary symbols and figures in various ochre colors with crude, stubby, stick ‘brushes.’ Each painting had a story behind it; the legends I recorded as told me by artists and older tribal members.7
Here again is a sense of the way Europeans constructed, choreographed or ‘manufactured’ the production of Aboriginal culture for their own purposes. Mountford constructed the Aborigines as a people without history, living in a timeless, unchanging society. As the expedition left Arnhem Land he concluded his article:



‘Free from European Influence’ 205
Calmly, slowly, the aborigines returned to their halcyon life in Arnhem Land where haste had no place, where time never mattered, where tribal folk didn’t reckon in days or years or even centuries.8
His master’s recording: Mountford’s style
The National Geographic article contains many photographs of the expedition’s work. In one of these photographs we see Mountford standing behind a packing crate marked ‘Arnhem Land Expedition, Darwin’, upon which sits sound recording equipment. At Mountford’s right, seated on the ground is an Aboriginal man singing or reciting, and holding clapping sticks. This photograph presents an image of the white colonial master clearly in control of the Aboriginal subject. Mountford stands above the Aboriginal man, adopting a pose of dominance and superiority, and is dressed in light coloured clothing reminiscent of the kind of tropical safari suits worn by explorers of earlier times. The Aboriginal man, in stark contrast, is seated cross-legged on the ground, is near naked and wears a headdress of feathers, a pendant and a loincloth. Mountford’s caption, titled ‘Much wailing but no microphone fright marks the amateur hour on Groote Eylandt’, reinforces the colonialist image (as does the name ‘India’ given to the Aboriginal man):
India, who wears white cockatoo feathers, beats time with sticks as he delivers an unmelodious chant about bandicoot, turtle, shark, or sting ray, all important tribal totems. The pendant, a charm bag which India bites in battle to give him courage and frighten his adversary, formerly contained the fat of an enemy. Examined by scientists, it revealed a medicine man’s darning needle used to ‘cure’ ill persons. Here the author makes the wire recording in a studio of eucalyptus boughs.9



206 Writing Heritage
Fred McCarthy was scathing about Mountford’s National Geographic piece, as he explained in 1950 in a letter to Peter BassettSmith, who had been the cine-photographer on the expedition:
The N.G.S [National Geographic Society] article was a great disappointment to me. Monty’s inclusion of himself working the wire-recorder whilst you were excluded both in this regard and in the photography, and the omission of Ray [Specht] altogether, appeared to me [to] be unfortunate but in your case typical of the lust for publicity which makes Monty so greedy. Then the style of writing in which Daddy Monty and all his children Frank, Fred, Margaret, Peter, and the rest have a nice picnic in Arnhem Land is in very poor taste and suggests an attitude of cordiality between the leader and the personnel that never existed. His constant reiteration of the wild natives among whom we worked is, to say the least of it, ridiculous particularly to the many people who know Arnhem Land.10
McCarthy also expressed his harsh judgement of Mountford’s methods to Ronald Berndt in 1956, writing that the expedition leader’s ‘method of interviewing natives is also open to criticism’. He went on to explain that:
In Arnhem Land he [Mountford] employed about a dozen or so men to make and paint various articles – barks, figures, etc. which they did during the day. At dusk or thereabouts he got them together near his tent with their out for the day [sic] and hammered the interpretations out of them, some times in a friendly way, at others in a bullying style. He’s partly deaf and his recordings of native words must be very inaccurate. His data is thus not the product of spontaneous work on the part of the natives but has been got from a short-term ‘pounding’ of the informants.11
As well as providing comments on Mountford’s methods of obtaining information from the Aboriginal people about their art and culture, McCarthy also reflected on his own approach, and on some



‘Free from European Influence’ 207
of the problems he had encountered while in the field. Writing in 1960 in one of the published records of the expedition he explained:
In the limited time available I had no opportunity of questioning the old men about the meaning, significance and age of the various paintings. Most of the paintings can be readily identified, but the opinions of individual natives vary considerably in identification, particularly where there is any doubt about the nature of the subject.12
This comment captures something of the notion, recognised in some Europeans’ writings, of cultural context and of Aboriginal art as being part of a dynamic, living heritage.
The Arnhem Land expedition published
Publications of the Arnhem Land expedition’s work continued to appear throughout the following decade. In 1955 McCarthy produced a ‘preliminary report’ in the journal Mankind on his work in recording the cave paintings of Groote and Chasm Islands.13 In contrast to the personal and enthusiastic tone of his diary entry reviewed earlier, his narrative in this article is written in a detached, formal academic style. He wrote:
These sites contain some 2,400 paintings, but there are probably as many more in other galleries yet to be recorded on these two islands. Historically they are of interest because paintings on Chasm Island seen by Captain Flinders and some of his officers during the voyage of 1802–03 were the first pictographs reported in Australia.14
In this article McCarthy presented a detailed analysis of styles, subjects and colours of the cave paintings. He called for wider application of this type of analysis as this would provide ‘a body of comparative data that will enable us to understand more clearly not only the chronological problems involved but also the relative



208 Writing Heritage
importance of economic and ritual subjects and inspiration in Aboriginal cave art’.15 This statement indicates McCarthy’s lifelong interest in, and advocacy for, wide-ranging and comparative research – a view that was to become particularly important in later years during his tenure as the inaugural Principal of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. The publications resulting from the Arnhem Land expedition contained extensive details of the collections that were acquired. In a 1956 publication, released as volume one of the Records of the American–Australian Scientific Expedition to Arnhem Land, Mountford boasted of the extent and range of the collections made from Arnhem Land:
The gross results of the collections, too, were impressive: 13,500 plant specimens, 30,000 fish, 850 birds, 460 animals, several thousand aboriginal implements and weapons, together with photographs and drawings of a large number of cave paintings from Chasm Island, Groote Eylandt and Oenpelli. There was also a collection of several hundred aboriginal bark paintings and two hundred string figures. In addition to the physical collections of natural history and ethnological specimens, each scientist had written extensive field notes as a basis for his scientific papers. There were also many hundreds of monochrome and coloured photographs as well as several miles of colour film on aboriginal life and natural history.16
Mountford explains how the bark paintings were specially made at the request of the researchers:
... In Arnhem Land, the aborigines make their paintings on the inside of their bark huts during the enforced idleness of the rainy season. Spencer was the first to notice them at Oenpelli [1928]. It is likely that, wherever the aborigines constructed their huts with sheets of bark, they would have painted designs on the inside of them. However, no painting taken from an Arnhem Land bark shelter would be more than a year old because, long before the onset



‘Free from European Influence’ 209
of the next wet season, it would have been destroyed by the elements, insects or fire. ... The paintings in the expedition collection, and, in fact, most of those housed in the various universities and museums, have never been part of a wet-weather shelter, but have been made at the request of the investigator.17
Collection of the bark paintings was accompanied by obtaining ‘myths’, stories and songs associated with them – a particular interest of Mountford’s, as he detailed:
... The method which I adopted was to ask the men to make bark paintings for me, seldom suggesting a subject. At the end of each day, the artists brought their work to my tent, related the associated myth, and explained the meanings of the designs.18
It is interesting to read these published accounts by Mountford in the light of the ‘subtext’ of criticism and carping among members of the expedition that permeates through much of the private correspondence. Mountford’s volume received several reviews, some of which were sharply critical. Ronald Berndt began his October 1958 review in the following negative tone:
The publication of Mr. C. P. Mountford’s volume on the art, myth and symbolism of Arnhem Land (1956) brings to our attention the urgent need to take stock of this anthropologically neglected aspect of Australian Aboriginal life. What indeed do we know, in social anthropological terms, of the function and significance of Aboriginal art? The answer must be – precious little: and that knowledge is not appreciably extended in the book under review.19
Berndt was concerned that ‘questions which a social anthropologist might ask are not even posed in this volume, let alone answered’. He continued, disparagingly:
Apart from the acknowledged value of this book in making available to us a great number of illustrations relating to Arnhem Land



210 Writing Heritage
artistic productions (and to the layman this may well override all other considerations), it has little to commend it. The discussion is not ‘scientific’ nor anthropological, and the descriptive procedure used throughout the volume is far from satisfactory. As far as the study of Australian Aboriginal art and mythology is concerned it is retrogressive.20
Berndt’s criticisms of Mountford’s work were numerous and wideranging. He described as a ‘complete misrepresentation’ Mountford’s assertion that Arnhem Land was ‘little known prior to the visit of the American–Australian Scientific Expedition’.21 Berndt thought Mountford’s many descriptions of ‘myths and stories, set out in conjunction with illustrations of bark paintings and of various objects’ were ‘completely unsatisfactory’. He argued that ‘except for some casual references to ritual and ceremony, there is ... no key to the significance of the mythology and the implications it may have in a social context. Instead, we are offered a motley of unrelated, disconnected and scrappy stories’.22 Berndt thought that the ‘most outstanding gap’ was Mountford’s ‘failure to treat mythology in relation to art (i.e., beyond noting that the one illustrates certain features of the other), which has left us with a vague descriptive account’.23 Berndt also took Mountford to task for his use of the term ‘primitive’, which ‘is being discarded by social anthropologists’, and for his ‘naïve comparisons with the art of prehistoric Europe and the African Bushmen’.24 He summed up his criticisms:
If one were to assess this as an ‘art book’, there could be nothing but praise for the superb illustrations – a field in which Mountford has always excelled. One can only regret that the text doesn’t match: and this is all the more regrettable in the light of its claims to be a comprehensive, authoritative, and ‘scientific’ study.25
Mountford’s book received similarly harsh judgement from sociologist Peter Worsley. Although praising Mountford for having ‘given professional anthropologists an object lesson in public



‘Free from European Influence’ 211
relations’, Worsley thought the work’s ‘scientific value’ to be ‘extremely meagre’, as he wrote:
... since the book is an old-fashioned ‘ethnological’ collection of ‘facts,’ with no explicit theoretical analysis whatsoever, it can only be of very limited value to the social anthropologist, the artist, the student of folklore or the comparative ethnologist.26
Mountford’s work was not entirely without supporters, as another reviewer B. L. Cranstone of the British Museum argued that the book was useful in that it provided a record of an otherwise ‘disappearing culture’. He wrote:
If a thorough investigation of Arnhem Land social structure is made before it is too late many anthropologists may be glad that Mr. Mountford has preserved this corpus of related information, for already, I gather, in some districts a good proportion of the bark paintings are made to order for the mission stations.27
In Mountford’s reply to Berndt’s criticism, he based his argument on the notion that Art, Myth and Symbolism was a book on art, not anthropology:
It is to be regretted that Dr. Berndt wasted so much of his valuable time, as well as the funds and space of ‘Mankind’ in reviewing my book from the entirely the wrong angle, that of the social anthropologist. Had he paused to look at the title, he would have noticed that it was not a book on social anthropology, but on Art; the art of the aborigines of Arnhem Land, the symbolism they employ in that art, and the myths illustrated by those symbols.28
Mountford, like Cranstone, rated the importance of his book as an illustrated record of the extensive range of Aboriginal material culture observed and collected by the expedition. He explained this cultural archive:



212 Writing Heritage
The book was written to record permanently this large and valuable collection. The cave paintings I have described are remote and inaccessible, while collections are so often dispersed, sometimes without being annotated, or even numbered, a fate which Dr. Berndt admits has already befallen his Arnhem Land collection of eleven years ago. ... the volume under review is by far the most extensive record of aboriginal art and its significance, yet to be published.29
Mountford also had some support for his work in a review in 1961 by Elkin, who described it as ‘a significant factual contribution to the study of Arnhem Land art’.30 Elkin acknowledged that Mountford did not have the kind of field experience in Arnhem Land ‘language, social structure, mythology and ritual’ that he and others possessed, stating that ‘it is lack of depth in these matters which handicaps Mr. Mountford as, of course, he realizes’. However, acknowledging Mountford’s strengths in some dimensions of Aboriginal art and culture, Elkin provided a more constructive critique of Mountford’s work, as he explained:
When dealing with form and pattern, he [Mountford] must be listened to with great respect, but in the sphere of meaning he is not on such sure ground. Meaning is not obtained by asking the artist or a bystander what a certain pattern indicates, nor merely by getting the myth it represents. Meaning comes after much travail out of the functional relationship of philosophy, belief, ritual, social structure and the general heritage of culture.31
Elkin’s succinct statement here indicates the view that he espoused consistently throughout his prolific career, that Aboriginal art is part of a whole culture that, taken as a whole, might be considered as a kind of system of philosophy.32

Aboriginal art as cultural heritage: Elkin and the Berndts
Mountford’s work on the art of Arnhem Land was only one of a rapidly growing body of publications on Aboriginal art. The steady accumulation of these studies was characterised by two emerging trends: a focus on the art of the Northern Territory, in particular Arnhem Land; and the recognition by some writers that art was to be understood as part of a wider system of Aboriginal culture and heritage. Among the more prolific of writers on Aboriginal art were the by now familiar names of Mountford, Elkin, and Ronald and Catherine Berndt. In 1950 Elkin and the Berndts collaborated in a publication entitled Art in Arnhem Land.33 In his Foreword to this volume, Elkin wrote poetically in homage to the Aboriginal people of Arnhem Land, and in praise of their art and culture:
This book is a tribute to the artists of Arnhem Land. Them and their clansfolk we have known in social and ceremonial life; we have shared their gossip in their own tongue, listened to their cogitations on life and death, been enveloped in their mysteries, and enchanted by their poetry and song. Such is the background of our appreciation of their visual art. Their paintings, carvings and decorations, which we have with us, are windows through which we see again their life and ours in Arnhem Land. Perhaps through our presentation of some of their artistic designs and symbols we shall enable others to glimpse something of the vividness and depth of Aboriginal art and culture.34
Here again is the emphasis on the relationship between art and society, with art providing a key to understanding these other aspects. As well as his many works on the history of Aboriginal studies, Elkin had also by this time published papers on aspects of Aboriginal cosmology. Much of his writing was based on fieldwork conducted in the Northern Territory in the early 1930s. In his 1932

paper ‘The secret life of the Australian Aborigines’, he detailed the role of sacred objects and sites in the life of the Aborigines, and argued for an understanding of the ‘secret life with its complex of beliefs, rites, customs, duties, and even languages’.35 Throughout his writing, Elkin understood that art, decoration, ceremony and other elements of Aboriginal culture and heritage are not separate from social, political and religious life, but are interconnected. In his book The Australian Aborigines, originally published in 1938, he stated of Aboriginal art, ‘we have studied it as a living element in the tribal culture of several regions, and have come to understand much of its meaning and of its function in the context of Aboriginal social life, religion and philosophy’.36 Similarly, in Art in Arnhem Land, Elkin and the Berndts explained what they saw as the relationship between art and ritual, claiming that ‘ritual implies art – at least for the Aborigines’.37 The authors expanded on their assertion that Aboriginal art must be understood as part of a living culture:
In this book we are not presenting an aesthetic study of ethnographical exhibits in a museum. We are social anthropologists concerned with art as an element in the lives of people whom we know – as an aspect of culture in which we have tried to steep ourselves.38
With an echo of earlier descriptions from Spencer’s 1912 visit and the more recent 1948 expedition to that region, Elkin and the Berndts draw attention to the rich art of Oenpelli:
In the Oenpelli region alone there are even to-day unvisited galleries of drawings in one rock shelter and cave after the other; and now is the time to study them while there are still some Aborigines who take pride in preserving the heritage of song and myth which has come down from owner to owner through twenty generations and more, the name of each owner in succession being known.39



‘Free from European Influence’ 215
This is a clear statement linking art with heritage, and defining the latter as a body of traditions and practices preserved by being transmitted through generations. Asserting that ‘paintings, engravings, sacred symbols, magical objects, carved posts, painted skulls, decorated baskets and spears’ have meaning only within their social and cultural contexts, the authors continued with their argument that art was part of cultural heritage:
Aboriginal art is an integral part of Aboriginal culture – of foodgetting and love-making, of magic and religion, of the continuum of the past and present. Its motifs, designs and media are part of the Aboriginal cultural heritage.40
Ronald and Catherine Berndt also maintained this more integrated approach to understanding Aboriginal art in a short article in the literary magazine Meanjin in 1950, in which they wrote:
Art to the anthropologist is something more than just beautiful drawings, carvings or workmanship, possessed of graceful lines and aesthetic values – it is the external expression of the ‘soul’ of the people. It fulfils a vital need in the culture, and is dictated by the tradition, religion and mythology. It is closely interwoven with the cultural configuration, and art forms are nearly always symbolic representations with a vast background of ‘history’ in the form of ritual and mythology.41
Later, in 1964 Ronald Berndt edited the book Australian Aboriginal Art, with contributions by several prominent experts. In his Preface, Berndt explained the development of Aboriginal art:
Australian Aboriginal art is becoming better known these days, or at least more widely known, than ever before. Once it was relegated to the ethnological section of a museum, and treated along with artifacts and material objects of other non-literate peoples. Now it is not unusual to find such things as Aboriginal bark paintings taking



216 Writing Heritage
their place alongside European and other examples of aesthetic expression.42
Elkin comments in his contribution on the capacity for change and adaptation in Aboriginal art, essentially explaining its role as part of cultural heritage:
... the variety in Aboriginal art, as represented both on weapons, implements, and ritual paraphernalia, and also on bark and rock, shows that, although there are traditional, tribal, and regional and ritual patterns, new ideas and new techniques have been worked out or obtained in some way and accepted. The Aborigines are no more hidebound in their art, be this painting, engraving, chanting, or dancing, than in their artifacts, their social organization, their ritual, or their ceremonies.43
T. G. H. Strehlow had a more conservative view of art among the people of Central Australia with whom he worked for a long time. To these people, Strehlow believed art was a means of adhering to ancient ancestral traditions, as he explained:
The Aboriginal pictorial art of inland Australia appears to have been linked almost everywhere to a greater or lesser degree with the religious beliefs of the native population. In this respect it resembled the other art forms of this region – song, dance, and verse. In the case of the art patterns associated with sacred drama and ritual these links were naturally strong, and their nature obvious. But, even in the purely decorative designs that were applied to weapons, tools, and utensils in everyday use, there was little interest, traditionally at least, in introducing new patterns. For it was maintained that the local supernatural personages who had first fashioned these weapons, tools and utensils, had determined their form, their shape, and their decorative patterns at the beginning of time. Hence the native artists seem to have made few attempts in recent times to change the decorative patterns, even when ornamenting non-sacred objects.44



‘Free from European Influence’ 217
Art and assimilation
Like many writers, Elkin and the Berndts also had some concerns about what they saw as the threats European culture posed to Aboriginal art. They alerted readers to the potential ‘disappearance’ of this art:
Such atrophy and ultimate disappearance have been the fate of native art in tribe after tribe as its members become affected by or immersed in civilization ... The introduction of tins, utensils, steel, axes, iron, cloth and boxes supplants articles of native manufacture, and so the craftsman’s skill is lost. Finally, as the Aborigines lose their own beliefs through European influence or because they are not fully initiated by the elders, the sacred background and ritual need for artistic expression is lost.45
They claimed that ‘whether we like it or not, the Aborigines, even of Arnhem Land, must find a positive place in the economic life and structure of Australia’.46 Part of this assimilation into white society was, they claimed, possible through the Aborigines’ artistic endeavours. They suggested that by using new, more ‘permanent’ materials such as canvas, and oils or watercolours, the Aborigines could enter the recently emerging ‘arts and crafts’ markets developed by the missions. The authors stated that ‘for some time to come, encouragement should be given to the Aboriginal leaders to retain their ceremonial life for the sake of the art, which is an essential element in it, as well as for the maintenance of social cohesion of the clans and tribes’.47 Thus art was seen as central to the ordered working of the Aboriginal societies and a key to Europeans’ notions of advancement. Discussing the possibility that the Arnhem Land Aborigines might adopt new media for their art, Elkin and the Berndts were



218 Writing Heritage
perhaps inevitably drawn to make reference to Albert Namatjira and the Hermannsburg painters of Central Australia. They wrote:
If the northern Arnhem Land artists adopted water colours or oils, we could expect a different development of theme than has occurred in the Hermannsburg (Central Australia) Aboriginal school of water colour artists. The latter’s native tradition of art consisted mainly of geometrical symbols – concentric circles, parallel lines and track marks, with very little, and that a poor, attempt at realism. So now, Albert Namatjira and his followers confine themselves to painting the geographical environment – the hills, ravines, trees and grass in all their brilliance of colour, with seldom any hint of anything Aboriginal. ... The men know little or nothing of the deep ritual and mythology of the Dreaming of their tribe, the Aranda; they are Christian, and culturally the products of contact.48
Turning their attention to the more traditionally oriented people of Arnhem Land, Elkin and the Berndts saw the encouragement of an arts and crafts industry in that region, adapted for modern materials and methods, and incorporated into a market, as one of the keys to ‘saving’ the Aborigines. This would also enable, in the authors’ view, the development of northern Australia. As they put it:
We have learnt that the full-blood Aborigines need not pass, if we provide for them, as we demand for other born Australians, adequate diet, prenatal and post-natal care for mothers, children’s clinics, medical services, and an independent economic life. We need these people for the peopling and development of northern Australia. We can have them. Therefore, let us see that they receive the education to which, as Australians, they are entitled; and let us give them full opportunity to develop the talents they possess. Amongst these talents is the capacity to draw and paint. It is, moreover, part of their own tradition, of their own life; and from that heritage of art they will be able, if encouraged, to produce



‘Free from European Influence’ 219
treasures new and old, to enrich Australia, a land which is theirs as well as ours.49
This idea that Aborigines might ‘advance’ by developing arts and crafts based on their ‘traditional’ designs and images and translated onto new media, was gaining increasing attention at this time. Other researchers held similar views during this period about the critical role of art in Aboriginal culture and heritage. Jane Goodale, for example, had been a member of an expedition to Bathurst Island in 1954 led by Mountford. In a paper published in 1966 with Joan D. Koss, she discussed social relations and processes that provided the context for artistic activity among the Tiwi people.50 Goodale and Koss suggested that the production of burial poles by Tiwi was characterised by a continuity of tradition, yet with a capacity for adapting to new materials and techniques. In the authors’ words:
We suggest that, despite change in other aspects of the culture, if the need and desire for burial poles remain they will be gratified in the traditional way with the customary fervor unless events disrupt the contexts for creative activity. Given the same opportunities for artistic activity, the same values and approximately equivalent patterns of social relations in art-producing contexts, introduced tools, techniques and ideas will yield stylistic variation but little change in the basic pattern of the art form. Among Tiwi, steel axes, manufactured pigments and new items of material culture have led to a greater number of sculpted and painted elements on the poles yet little extensive change.51
Another writer who expressed firm views on change and continuity in Aboriginal art and culture was Melbourne ethnologist and art expert, Leonhard Adam.

‘Free from European influence’: Leonhard Adam on art and collecting
German born Leonhard Adam was an anthropologist and lawyer who had worked and taught in Europe and England before being interned as an ‘enemy alien’ in 1940 and ‘dispatched to Australia’.52 Before arriving in Australia Adam had ‘already studied and published extensively in primitive law’, and during his internment at Tatura camp in Victoria he ‘gave lessons on primitive religion and ethnology’.53 Adam published the first edition of his major work, Primitive Art, in 1940 in England, and later produced several articles on Aboriginal art.54 Through these works, and his papers held at the University of Melbourne Archives, it is possible to glean some insights into Adam’s wide-ranging experience and interests in Aboriginal art and cultural heritage. Like many writers, Adam held an idealised view of Aboriginal art and culture as pristine and ‘authentic’, and he expressed some disdain at European influence. While desiring the continuity of some kind of authenticity, Adam also promoted the idea of developing Aboriginal art through training and the introduction of new materials and techniques. He held forth on a question that preoccupied many writers and observers of Aboriginal culture: whether the art being produced by Albert Namatjira could be considered as Aboriginal art or as European art that was created by an Aboriginal person. In the third edition of his book Primitive Art, published in 1954, he wrote:
During the last ten years or so a distinguished Australian landscapepainter, Mr Rex Battarbee, has scored a triumph as art teacher of a number of natives of the Aranda tribe in Central Australia. His first pupil was Albert Namatjira, now a recognized landscape-painter, whose water-colours have been exhibited more than once in the capital cities of Australia. ... He has a marked sense of colour, is a good draughtsman in the European sense of the term, and, thanks to his teacher, knows all about linear and colour perspective. Many



‘Free from European Influence’ 221
of his pictures are distinguished by their excellent composition, and they have the true atmosphere of the country. But it is European art, and Namatjira’s achievement is by no means a step towards an organic development of the primitive art of his people, but only a wonderful proof of the Australian aborigines’ latent talent and learning ability.55 This ‘Hermansburg [sic] school of native painters’, as they have been called, has grown up in an area of culture contact between black and white, and thus not far from the undisturbed setting of the nomadic hunter. Unfortunately, their output is very large ... But there are already indications of a mass production on the part of the more serious group of adult painters ....56 Let us hope, however, that the case of the native water-colourists of Central Australia will remain an exception, for it is irrelevant for the solution of a much deeper, and more important problem, namely, the future of real Australian aboriginal art ... and the development of the aborigines’ own artistic talent rather than their imitative ability.57
Adam continued:
It does not follow that the aborigines should not use modern art materials. Their use alone does not necessarily mean that the native artist will become the ape of the white man. This is inevitable only if a European artist practises in the presence of talented aborigines, even without talking to them. ... But when European art materials are made available to the aborigines with only a minimum of simply technical European art instruction, the result may be amazing ...
Adam argued for support for Aboriginal art, as a purely ‘decorative’ medium of expression:
It would be good if the competent authorities would help the aborigines as a whole to develop their ancient primitive art and to adapt its attractive decorative patterns to modern requirements ...58



222 Writing Heritage
In a statement reminiscent of the views of Elkin and the Berndts, Adam argued for the benefit of developing Aboriginal arts and crafts for economic improvement. He advocated the pursuit of activities such as weaving as a means of maintaining Aboriginal aesthetics, referring to Aboriginal artistic works as ‘handicrafts’:
There are two handicrafts in which aboriginal art could be usefully employed, viz, pottery and weaving. Weaving has already been introduced, on a small scale, on some mission stations, but European designs are still principally used. I can imagine that carpets and rugs, made in an Oriental technique but decorated in purely aboriginal patterns and colours, would produce a magnificent effect and probably soon be in great demand; they might also become a high-grade article for export. ... All the guidance required would be purely technical – i.e., how to handle the loom or, respectively, the potter’s wheel – whereas aesthetic arrangements of the designs and shades should be entirely left to the genius of the aborigines, without any interference by white artists, whose vision is different, and whose ideas would naturally spoil the originality of aboriginal work.59
Here Adam is writing within an assimilationist paradigm, as he offers his suggestions for developing Aboriginal art in a European context. Adam’s views conjure an image of the benevolent, although well-intentioned expert proffering the superiority of European technology as a means by which the Aborigines could be raised from their subject or dependent status. As well as his published thoughts on Aboriginal art, Adam also had an interest in collecting cultural objects, particularly with the aim of developing an ethnological collection for the University of Melbourne.60 Along with planning to make paper copies of rock paintings, he also wanted to build his collection of artifacts, as he wrote to Douglas Boerner in 1955 while planning for a University expedition to Alice Springs:



‘Free from European Influence’ 223
Please, note that, apart from the copying of the rock-paintings, I have two other purposes. Firstly, we want to collect stone implements, i.e, older, flaked scrapers and other flaked types, as many as possible, for the University Collection. We are not so very keen on nice ground axe heads (which are preferred by amateurs), although if we find one we would not mind collecting it. We are not anxious to purchase any wooden implements, except if we are offered a particularly beautiful churinga.61
Here again, as we saw with Croll and others, Adam has a weakness for the lure of the prize ‘specimen’. Though his letter has a slight tone of humility, he was nonetheless clearly keen on collecting the odd ‘nice ground edge axe head’ or ‘particularly beautiful churinga’. While expressing his interest in collecting, Adam also had some views about meeting with Aboriginal people:
Generally speaking, we are not anxious to make contact with aborigines, although we should like to pay a visit to Hermannsburg if possible (my wife has been there before, when Pastor Albrecht was there).62
This is a clear instance of the ‘distancing’ practiced by many Europeans, whose interests in Aboriginal material culture were decontextualised, and removed the Aboriginal people from their purview. Adam again expressed his view about the role of artists such as Namatjira:
I should like to avoid any contact with people associated with the so-called ‘Hermannsburg School’ of European water-colour painters. I suppose you have read what I think of it in the latest edition of Primitive Art. I admire Namatjira but I am sure his art, a great personal achievement, will not help a bit to develop true aboriginal art. It is wrong to describe watercolours done by aborigines in an essentially European technique, and with European media, as ‘aboriginal art’.63



224 Writing Heritage
Adam’s concern for what he considered ‘true’ Aboriginal art was expressed often in his correspondence. Like many collectors he had a wide circle of correspondents in various localities that were sources for Aboriginal cultural objects. He wrote in 1955 to the Rev. G. J. Symons, Superintendent of the Methodist Mission at Yirrkala:
I am much obliged to you for your kind letter of the 25th ult. If I can get up to ten good bark paintings, carefully executed and, as far as you can prevent it, free from European influence.64
Adam also expressed a desire for information about the cultural context of these:
Of course, for demonstrations of lectures on aboriginal beliefs, myths and rituals, it would be very highly appreciated if the interpretation supplied by the artist himself would be recorded. Also we should like to know the name, clan, and approximate age of the artist in each case.65
This desire for detailed information associated with the bark paintings was somewhat unusual among collectors, as many collections that were acquired generally lacked any details of their cultural contexts. Europeans’ interests in collecting bark paintings from Oenpelli and other centres in the Northern Territory were by this stage becoming attuned to the politics of the exchange. Collectors, sponsors, administrators and the many others who made up the socio-cultural context within which collecting was carried out were inevitably becoming more aware of matters such as the roles and responsibilities of various participants, the ethics of collecting, and issues concerning the removal of barks from Australia.



‘Free from European Influence’ 225
‘Much trouble about getting informants’: working with Aborigines
Adam’s explicit desire that he was ‘not anxious to make contact with Aborigines’ epitomises the kind of ambivalent attitudes many Europeans maintained towards Aboriginal people. While the collecting, documenting and recording of Aboriginal culture grew at an ever increasing rate, relations between Europeans and Aboriginal people remained complex and often fraught. The tensions between those who wrote about and observed Aboriginal cultures from the safe distance of their armchairs and the academies, and others who spent many years among Aboriginal people, had been clearly palpable in the correspondence reviewed earlier between George Aiston and his Melbourne colleague Gill. They reappear often, either in subtle ways or explicitly, as in the following correspondence between Fred McCarthy and European academic Andreas Lommel in 1955:
Dear Dr. Lommel I can well imagine the beautiful copies that your wife would make of the Wondjinas and other paintings in the Kimberleys, but I am sorry to hear that you had so much trouble about getting informants otherwise. The tribal movements are astounding and it appears that little anthropological work of real value can now be done in the Kimberleys. The same story also unfortunately is being enacted all over Australia and most of our anthropologists are going to New Guinea.66
This kind of statement foreshadowed discussions and debates about working in Aboriginal societies that became more explicit following the establishment of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies in 1964.67 No longer would the Aborigines be seen to be little more



226 Writing Heritage
than the passive, silent objects of European study as increasingly their actions and voices began to be noted, articulated and expressed.
Showcasing Aboriginal culture: the UNESCO Exhibition
By the 1950s, despite a growing consciousness of the rights and interests of the Aboriginal peoples whom Europeans were studying, and whose cultures they were recording and collecting, there continued much collecting and display of Aboriginal culture without sufficient attention to context. An example of this was an exhibition of Aboriginal culture organised by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). The concept for that exhibition had originated in 1949 when the Commonwealth Government agreed to a request from the Australian UNESCO Committee for Museums to fund a travelling exhibition ‘to illustrate the life of the Australian aborigines’.68 The 1953 exhibition at the Australian Museum in Sydney consisted of twenty-four panels, and it travelled widely throughout Australia and overseas. Fred McCarthy, one of the organisers, wrote that ‘this exhibition is probably unique in respect to the method adopted to portray the life and culture of a primitive people in a self-contained portable display’.69 The panels illustrated typify the museum approach to Aboriginal culture and heritage, with its compartmentalisation of different elements of culture. Thus ‘cave paintings, ‘rock engravings, ‘bark paintings’, ‘decorative art’, and ‘ceremonial life’ were shown in separate, distinct panels, apparently without a narrative linking them, which would demonstrate the close interdependence between these and other elements of Aboriginal culture.



‘Free from European Influence’ 227
Institutionalising collections
During the 1950s and 1960s the collections of Aboriginal material culture that had been amassed by amateur and professional collectors, anthropologists, missionaries and others over many decades began to gain the attention of government officials interested in developing ethnographic collections in museums and universities. Taking up the refrain sounded earlier by Radcliffe Brown, these officials argued for the importance of establishing a national ethnographic collection. The anthropologist Donald Thomson, who had spent many years in Arnhem Land, had acquired a substantial collection of Aboriginal art and cultural materials. In 1959 there was some interest by the Commonwealth in acquiring his collection, as the nucleus of a possible national centre for art and culture. A letter from the National Capital Development Commission to the Prime Minister’s Department outlined this interest:
... A few weeks ago I was in touch with Mr. Cumming in connection with a proposal which Sir Daryl Lindsay had made in one of our National Capital Planning Committee meetings that a collection of aboriginal art that Dr. Donald Thompson [sic] has under his charge in Melbourne should be secured for the Commonwealth and housed in the proposed National Centre at Capital Hill. ... As far as aboriginal art is concerned our Committee has emphasized the fact that material is rare and is rapidly disappearing. It has been stressed that unless steps are taken to secure existing collections or to make permanent records of work in this field the opportunity of preserving material for posterity may be lost. This led to a discussion on the collection which Dr. Donald Thompson now holds in the Melbourne University. ... One complication which must be mentioned is that of ownership of the material. Dr. Thompson speaks of the collection as his to be disposed of as and when he feels inclined. We have not



228 Writing Heritage
questioned this view or discussed it with the University where the collection is now located. No doubt this is one of the first questions that would have to be considered in the event of the Government wishing to pursue the matter.70
The comment about Thomson’s proprietorial claims in the collection that he had acquired highlights the sense of ownership that collectors had generally over their collections. In today’s context, ownership of Indigenous cultural materials (often now referred to as ‘cultural property’) continues to be a contested domain, and the subject of some debate. There is still considerable resistance by some sectors of society to the fact of Indigenous rights in these collections. This is despite (or perhaps because of) an increasing prominence given to Indigenous peoples’ claims to these materials that have been taken from their societies. Prior to 1961 the government’s primary collecting institution was the Australian Institute of Anatomy. This Institute’s anthropology curator was Helen Wurm, who was also one of the leading figures in collecting and studying Arnhem Land bark paintings. Wurm was given the task of assessing collections and negotiating for their acquisition by the Institute. Among the collections sought by the Institute were those by Melbourne collectors Fred Smith, Stan Mitchell and Bob Wishart. Writing to Fred Smith in 1961 Wurm cautioned about maintaining the integrity of the collection if it were sold privately:
Mr Mitchell also mentioned to me that he had a talk to you about your collection of aboriginal stone- and wooden implements and that you might consider arranging for disposal of the collection in entirety. I know that you originally planned to have the collection auctioned for private collectors. Unfortunately in this case the dealers would outbid any private persons and the items you have so painstakingly collected and arranged at your home would be scattered around and loose [sic] a great deal of their value they have as a unity.71



‘Free from European Influence’ 229
Wurm extolled the virtues of Smith’s collection being acquired by a national museum:
I wonder if you would consider offering your whole collection as it is for sale to the Institute of Anatomy, which is the custodian of the National Ethnographic collection, which will eventually be housed in the proposed National Museum to be built in Canberra in the near future. It would be known for all times as the ‘Fred Smith Collection’ and items would be suitably displayed for the many interstates [sic] and overseas visitors who come through Canberra and do ap[p]reciate aboriginal exhibits.72
She argued for the role of the public museum in preserving material culture:
Only in offering the collection to a museum you can be sure that it will be preserved for posterity. If it goes in private hands it may be ap[p]reciated by the person who buys it at present but what will happen when this person dies? The objects may come into hands where they are absolutely of no interest and may end up being broken as children’s toys or rott [sic] away in an attic and I am sure that it is not what you would like to happen.73
Wurm’s remarks about the possibility of the collection being acquired by private collectors also indicate a concern for maintaining the integrity of collections. Another collector approached by Wurm was Dr Robert Milne Wishart, a New Zealand-born medical doctor who had established a practice in Melbourne.74 He was one of the founders of the Anthropology Society of Victoria and was President of that Society for some time.75 His collection of Aboriginal artifacts was said to rank ‘among Australia’s biggest private accumulations of this kind’.76 Wishart, like many of these collectors, had enthused about the quantity of items he found, as the following newspaper article revealed:



230 Writing Heritage
‘Our best find ever was in 1932 in the Western District, on a sheep property out of Willaura,’ he [Wishart] remembers. ‘This had been the area of the Tjapwurun tribe. Fred Smith and I picked up 1700 stone implements in one day and solemnly counted them that night. It was like having all our birthdays at once.’77
Wishart collected over a period of approximately twenty-four years, until around 1957.78 Like many amateur collectors, he sought his objects from the surface, and also procured them from other collections or by purchase.79 Wurm gave her assessment of Wishart’s collection:
I recently inspected the above collection in Melbourne and was very impressed with the range of material of which the collection consists, the condition of the material and the meticulous way in which the majority of items are documented and labelled, a factor which adds greatly to the value of any collections.80
While Wurm was negotiating the acquisition of the Fred Smith and Bob Wishart collections, Stan Mitchell was preparing for the potential disposal of his collection.
Publishing and collecting: the Stan Mitchell Collection
Stanley Robert Mitchell had been prominent among stone tool collectors for a long period of time, and in 1949 had published his Stone Age Craftsmen.81 In this work Mitchell argued that stone tools were best understood by knowledge of their uses and the materials that they were made from. He also believed that what was required was ‘knowledge of his [the Aborigine’s] tribal territory, its climate, and its animal and vegetable resources’.82 Mitchell continued to focus on implements found on the surface at former Aboriginal campsites, notwithstanding that stone tool analyses now potentially benefited from data provided by stratigraphic-based archaeological excavations. He wrote that:



‘Free from European Influence’ 231
The largest proportion of stone artifacts from the camps are found on the surface. The general absence of stratificational evidence makes it impossible to state whether more than one culture is represented, but it is certain that their production extended over a considerable period and the camps were occupied by different native peoples with characteristic techniques.83
Although apparently comprehensive and authoritative in its presentation, and based as it was on decades of collecting, Stone-Age Craftsmen nonetheless prompted some readers with greater experience among Aboriginal people to question some of its details. One such person was Melbourne-based anthropologist Donald Thomson, who had spent many years working among Aboriginal people in Arnhem Land, and who had a good understanding of the material culture from the people of that region. Thomson wrote to Mitchell in 1950 to discuss certain aspects of tool uses and functions, expressing his concern that in his experience living among Aboriginal people he had not seen instances of the kinds of uses of stone implements that were described in Mitchell’s work:
I have just been reading your ‘Stone-Age Craftsmen’ and have been much interested in your notes and comments on the use of stone implements and particularly scrapers. ... A point that strikes me always when I read the accounts of the use of stone-scrapers which are found in such numbers in old middens and camp sites, is the fact that, although I have lived for years among people who are making and using flint and other stone implements, I have seen very few stone implements actually used as scrapers.84
In a similar way to the discussions between George Aiston and W. H. Gill, Thomson’s letter suggests tensions between those who theorised about Aboriginal material culture (Mitchell, in this case), and others who formed their views on the basis of having lived and worked closely with Aboriginal people.



232 Writing Heritage
The publication of Mitchell’s Stone Age Craftsmen also prompted Sydney ethnologist Fred McCarthy to mention his differences with Mitchell. He wrote to Leonhard Adam that ‘[f]or some reason unknown to me Mitchell has not shown me the manuscript of his book on the Victorian stone implement camp-sites although I think I could help him in many ways. He still adheres to the old “material governing form” complex and he knows I have other views so perhaps this is the difficulty.’85 With perhaps a hint of rivalry, McCarthy described Mitchell’s book as ‘a very useful work of 200 odd pages, beautifully illustrated and printed, but technically it leaves much to be desired’.86 After a lifetime’s collecting, the time eventually arrived when Mitchell felt a need to consider the future of his collection. In 1961 he wrote to anthropologist Bill Stanner, informing him about his plans:
Further to our conversation of yesterday regarding the disposal of my ethnological collection, I wish to notify you that in my Will it has to be offered to the Federal Government. Much as I would like to donate the collection I have to make provision for Probate, being now 80 years of age. ... I have already donated a large collection of mineral specimens to the C.S.I.R.O. now housed at Fishermans Bend, Melbourne. I can only make a provisional valuation of the ethnological collection of five to six thousand pounds pending a census to be completed.87
At 80 years of age, Mitchell’s concerns were now with maintaining the ‘integrity’ of his collection, and in ensuring its ordered accessibility for future students and researchers. He explained this to Stanner:
... My book ‘Stone Age Craftsmen’ was largely based on my collection and 30 years intensive collecting around many parts of Australia and study of the Australian aborigine stone industry. In the event of the Government taking it over I should appreciate it



‘Free from European Influence’ 233
being kept intact as it is now so arranged to give students a proper perspective of the stone work of the aborigines. During several visits to Canberra I have sorted out and classified most of the stone artifacts in the Institute of Anatomy and it is now in excellent order, but so far there is no proper system of recording. This should be attended to as soon as possible. I have kept each donor’s collections intact, showing his name in each tray. If this system is adopted and becomes known it should encourage owners of collections to donate them to a truly National Museum.88
In response to offers to purchase his collection, in February 1962, not long before his death, Mitchell wrote again to Stanner who was then representing the newly established Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies:
Your letter of February 8th, with an offer of [£]1500/-/- for my ethnological collection has been given my careful consideration. My original approach to the Federal Government through Sir W. Cooper was to ascertain whether it would be interested in acquiring this collection on my decease. The offer I consider far too low and I am now making a census for a proper valuation. I was a trustee and Treasurer of the National Museum, Melbourne for ten years and have much experience in valuing collections for purchase by our Museum.89
Here we see a clear illustration of the ways in which Aboriginal material culture acquires the status of a desirable commodity, subject to negotiations over its presumed monetary value. Mitchell had been a tireless advocate for the right of the amateur collectors to continue their activities without the constraints of legislation. He complained to Stanner about these matters, and the role of Fred McCarthy:
With due respect to Mr. McCarthy I wish to state that he has been adverse to Museums buying ethnological material, and has been advocating the passing of an Act to prevent private individuals



234 Writing Heritage
collecting such material and to make it illegal to own them. Had this been in operation in the past much invaluable material would have been lost to science.90
Mitchell went on to describe his long involvement in collecting, and to extol the virtues of his collection. Like Mountford, he had a strong sense of the importance of his own role in collecting, clearly implying that he had ‘saved’ many stone implements from obscurity or invisibility. He reflected to Stanner:
Many of the surface camp sites investigated by me are now unavailable, owing to the planting of Marram grass, pines, housing projects and agricultural activities. ... My study of the stone implements of the Australian aborigines commenced in 1921 through the influence of Baldwin Spencer and A. S. Kenyon and I have had opportunities of visiting many places on the continent always with a view to securing a complete range of the artifacts. My collection is most comprehensive and should be invaluable to future students.91
After Mitchell’s death in 1963, Melbourne museum curator Aldo Massola described him as ‘the last of the early students of the stone implements of the Australian Aborigines’. As ‘a contemporary of the great men of a bygone generation’ he was, in Massola’s estimation:
the last representative of a school which included Sir Baldwin Spencer, Kenyon, Mahoney, Mann, Stirling, Thorpe and others who were steadfast in the idea that the stone implements used by the Aborigines were inexorably fixed in type and that this type was dictated by the availability of the material on the one hand, and the fracturability of it on the other.92
The concerns of curators and collectors for maintaining ethnographic collections as complete entities, properly classified and labelled, reflected a growing consciousness of the role of ethnographic collection in the formation of national identity. Although



‘Free from European Influence’ 235
clearly imbued with their desires to imprint these collections with their own individual identities, Mitchell, Smith and other collectors also had an eye on the value of their collections to the nation.
Valuing collections
In discussions about collections and their acquisition, questions about their value were often central. In 1974 a Mr Webster in Western Australia was interested in selling his collection to the Aboriginal Arts Board. He wrote to H. C. Coombs, then Chairman of the Australian Council for the Arts, about his endeavours to sell his collection to Robert Edwards, Director of the Aboriginal Arts Board:
... Mr Robert Edwards did, in due course, make contact and later visited us and, of course, inspected the collection. He has expressed the judgment that it is a very fine collection of Aboriginal Artifacts.93
According to Webster, Edwards had written to him to ‘say that the Institute [Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies] considers the price is too high and “quite beyond its resources”’. Webster detailed his views to Coombs about the value of the collection:
Through me, the family (five of them) had asked Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand dollars which represents a fair recompense for five generations of effort in collecting, caring for and preserving a national asset which is far more than a fine work of art, it is the very essence of how the earliest known peoples on this planet pursued their very existence. It is visual factual evidence of how the most primitive peoples known to civilized mankind had carried on their lives for countless thousands of years, right up to the twentieth century.94
This is remarkably racialised language for this period (‘the most primitive peoples known to civilised mankind’). We know nothing



236 Writing Heritage
of Webster, yet this letter indicates something of the pervasiveness of the notion of Aborigines as examplars of the primitive in the European imagination. Webster described some of the collection in his attempt to persuade the authorities of its uniqueness:
Some of the pieces are so rare and quite frail, such as a fish net strung with genuine Aboriginal women’s hair, that I have not permitted others to handle; grinding stones encased in plastic bags which I would not allow to be touched by white men’s hands other than people such as you and the Prime Minister himself.95
He concluded his appeal:
I feel quite sure that you, personally, will agree that such like things cannot be talked of in the context and phraseology of ‘market values’. I only wish that we were sufficiently well off to make a gift of the whole collection to the nation.96
Coombs forwarded Webster’s letter to Edwards, and received a reply in October 1974 stating:
Thank you for your letter of 26th September in regard to the acquisition of the Webster collection of Aboriginal artifacts. I am afraid the price asked in this instance was quite outrageous, so much so that further negotiations seem pointless. While prepared to recommend purchase of historic collections of importance to Aboriginals at good prices, the level of exploitation was beyond all reason.97
This correspondence illustrated the vexed issue of assigning a monetary value to collections of Indigenous cultural materials. By thus valuing Indigenous collections they also became, in a sense, transformed into market commodities, which further removes them from the cultural contexts within which they originated. Edwards’ acknowledgement of the importance of these collections to the



‘Free from European Influence’ 237
Aboriginal people is a rare instance of such recognition of Indigenous peoples’ rights and interests in their cultural heritage. Until comparatively recent times, many collectors pursued their activity removed from any ‘living’ Aboriginal context. The artifacts were collected, displayed, debated and discussed almost purely as physical objects, regardless of any social and cultural context in which they were produced, used and circulated. There was an absence of any sense of the ways in which material objects interact with the human world (or the spiritual world). Only in more recent years has there been a recognition that, in the words of archaeologist Julian Thomas, ‘objects, whether or not they have been transformed by human labour, become bound up with human projects, and form part of the web of relations in which we are embedded’.98
Institutionalising research: the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies
In recognition of the need to formalise the study of Aboriginal societies and cultures, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies (AIAS), now known as the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS), was formally established by statute in 1964. The Institute’s functions were, as set out by Fred McCarthy, its founding Principal, ‘to promote and publish research on the Australian Aborigines, to encourage co-operation between institutions concerned with this field of research, and to assist these institutions in the training of research workers’.99 The Institute was to play a leading role from this time on in collection and research on all aspects of Aboriginal culture and society.

Spike and Fred: retouch, and the art of Woy Woy
The formation of a national ethnographic collection was part of a process by which Europeans were increasingly engaging with the idea of preserving Aboriginal culture as national heritage. There were, though, other ways that Europeans perceived ‘preservation’, as in the following exchange between Fred McCarthy and the late British comedian Spike Milligan in 1962. Milligan was at this time residing at the New South Wales town of Woy Woy. He wrote to McCarthy, who was still curator of anthropology at the Australian Museum, to seek the latter’s advice on his desire to ‘save’ some rock paintings from erosion by retouching them:
I am the unshaven creature who recently visited you with the news I had discovered a new Aboriginal cave which you politely informed me was already on your books. ... Most of the carvings of the DARUK tribe are in danger of wearing away within the next 10–20 years, now, my brother and I (we are both artists, he professional, I amateur) took the trouble to ‘re-etch’ a small carving (a dingo dog), we took great care to follow the original line, where we were not certain, we left the line untraced, being ‘truists’, we used local hard stone chippings to re-etch the subject, now Sir, if you do not object to the above, have I your permission to approach the National Trust asking for any of their members who are either sculptors or artists (that is most important) who might like to carry on this work, but only on carvings that are in danger of disappearing through erosion? Also may I put up small notices asking for people not to deface the statues, and a small notice saying that the carvings are attributed to the Daruk tribe? A hasty reply please – I leave for England in Nov. by then with your permission I could, I think do some good work in preserving the carvings. I beg you not to consider me as a crank the carvings will soon be gone for ever, and a few copies on paper can never re-create the thrill of the genuine article.100



‘Free from European Influence’ 239
Although Milligan did not, as Mountford had, profess to have ‘saved the art from oblivion’, he did share the South Australian’s passion for preserving Aboriginal artistic creations from destruction by erosion and other deleterious impacts. His admirable concern for the preservation of this carving site raises issues about the appropriateness of retouching. McCarthy replied, encouraging Milligan in his retouching work:
The question of re-grooving the rock engravings has been discussed from time to time but there is no general agreement among students of the subject as to whether or not it should be done. As time goes by, and the natural elements wear down the engravings more and more, it is becoming obvious that serious consideration will have to be given to this method of at least saving the figures as [far] as it is humanly possible. ... I would not advocate a wholesale programme of re-grooving – this would raise howls of protest on all sides, and I think with some justification. Modern methods of recording, particularly at night with a strong lamp, have shown that the Aboriginal artists added figures to many groups generation after generation, so that figures in all stages of preservation from faint and almost indiscernible to those with well preserved grooves may be seen. Where all of the figures in a group are old figures and very faint the problem arises of how best to save them? I feel that the best course for you to follow is to re-groove a few figures, or even a small group. Do this work quietly, without any publicity, to see what the result will be. It would be a most interesting experiment, and if successful could be used as an argument for further re-grooving elsewhere.101
While encouraging Milligan in this retouching, McCarthy’s letter conveyed a sense of wariness (‘do this work quietly, without any publicity’), suggesting that the museum curator was sensitive to the potentially negative impact of retouching this site.

A major field of inquiry: Aboriginal art in the 1960s
By the 1960s Aboriginal art continued to be an important field for study and contemplation. There was a proliferation of writings by people such as Elkin, the Berndts, McCarthy and Mountford individuals who had dominated anthropology and Aboriginal art studies for decades. Aboriginal art was now more often studied not in isolation, but in terms of its relationship to other elements of Aboriginal culture, and as part of living society. One person who had made the study of Aboriginal art his life’s work was Charles Mountford, whose involvement in the 1948 Arnhem Land expedition had been a crucial point in his career. Among his many other activities, Mountford was a member of a committee formed in the late 1950s by the Council of the Royal Anthropological Institute to organise a symposium on ‘primitive art’. The papers and discussions of that symposium, entitled ‘The Artist in Tribal Society’, were published in 1961.102 In his presentation to the symposium, Mountford remained fixed in his unquestioned view of Aboriginal art as primitive and his denial of change and transformation. He stated boldly that ‘Aboriginal culture did not alter under the white man – it simply died out – and nothing, as yet, has taken its place’. He also wrote that ‘the subject of the artist and his art in Australian aboriginal society is of particular interest to the art historian because the aborigines are probably the most primitive of any living people’.103 These antiquated views of an unchanging Aboriginal society were hallmarks of Mountford’s approach throughout his career. Although he understood that art, ceremony, song, dance and story were intimately intertwined within Aboriginal society, this did not detract from Mountford’s ‘stone age’ view of Aboriginal technology as the ‘simplest in the world’, comparable with that of the European Palaeolithic.



‘Free from European Influence’ 241
This notion of ‘primitive’ as a reference to earlier, supposedly simpler cultures was challenged by the editor of the publication, Marian Smith, who offered a useful critique of the term ‘primitive art’, suggesting that it ‘is inaccurate and suggests conditions which are not borne out in fact’.104 She elaborated:
The objects designated are not primitive in the sense that they are early; they are not early; they are not the primitive precursors of our Western tradition. The first expressions of an art style are better called ‘archaic’, and this word has been adopted by both archaeologists and art historians. The great examples of primitive art are the results of long development, culminations of expression in wellestablished traditions. The primitive is not necessarily either simple or unsophisticated ... Primitive art is wholly contemporary with our own – it is distinguished entirely by the differences of the art traditions involved.105
Although critical of the primitivist view of Aboriginal art, in her introduction to Mountford’s contribution, Smith nonetheless promoted Aboriginal culture on the basis of absence – in this case, an absence of complexity, or variety, in material culture. She wrote:
We open our discussion with reference to a distant region, distant not only in space but in the simplicity of its technology. No people of modern history have lived with as few items of material culture as the Australian aborigine. It is said that some tribes have only four things in their list of material possessions. Yet as Mr. Mountford has previously shown, these aborigines have a rich artistic life.106
Mountford remained consistent in his view that Aboriginal art and culture were primitive on the basis of their resemblance to those of an earlier time, the Palaeolithic, based on their apparent simplicity. He expounded this view in 1975, many years after his retirement, in a letter to Alexander Marshak of the Peabody Museum at Harvard:



242 Writing Heritage
In an address I gave some years ago before the Royal Anthropological Institute of London, I said, casually, that as the aborigines in the remote parts of Australia had a simpler material culture than the ice age man of Europe, yet they had a rich philosophy and a code of just laws, would it not be a reasonable hypothesis to postulate that Paleolithic man had similar concepts. Of course, I was heavily attacked for this remark, but the more I have considered the matter during later researches, the more I am convinced that this hypothesis is reasonable.107
Mountford’s old-fashioned views stood in some contrast to those of Elkin and the Berndts, who years earlier had already been describing Aboriginal art as an element of living culture, and as part of Aboriginal cultural heritage. However, Mountford was not alone in his primitivist and evolutionary view on Aboriginal culture, as other writers propounded similar ideas throughout the 1960s.
Australia as a living laboratory
Despite the work of some more enlightened thinkers, Europeans’ writings gave remarkably persistent representations of Aboriginal art as being simple, and as an antecedent to present day art. In 1963 South Australian anthropologist Norman Tindale collaborated with writer H. A. Lindsay in a publication aimed at the popular market. Simply titled Aboriginal Australians, this slim volume set out these authors’ views in straightforward, accessible language, drawing extensively on Tindale’s earlier fieldwork. Despite having been published in 1963, this book maintained the view of Aboriginal people as ‘stone-age’, as the authors began:
Australia is the only place in the world where we can study a simple hunting people, still living with the aid of the tools of the Old Stone Age. Not only do they show us how our own early ancestors may have lived, worked and played long ago; they also provide us



‘Free from European Influence’ 243
with a guide as to how the prehistoric peoples of other lands developed their cultures.108
Reminiscent of Mountford’s approach, this work also perpetuated the stereotype of Aborigines as exemplars of ‘stone age man’, and Australia as a ‘living laboratory’ where these people could be studied. In Aboriginal Australians, Tindale outlined for the ordinary reader his theory of the ‘origins’ of the Aboriginal peoples, based largely on his archaeological work at a site called Devon Downs in South Australia in 1929 and at other sites. His analysis of stone tools and other materials from this site had led him to formulate a theory that Aboriginal culture was comprised of successive migrations of peoples over a long period of time. Each of these peoples had, in Tindale’s scheme, a different kind of stone technology. Tindale and Lindsay devote a chapter to ‘art’, in which, notwithstanding the general primitivist tone of their book, they extol the virtues of the decorative and artistic skills of the Aborigines:
Our museums today house great treasures of aboriginal art, ranging from crude scratchings and daubings to work of such excellence that civilised artists have copied the designs. These indicate how the aborigines devoted time to some forms of art work when they had the necessary leisure.109
Their comment that ‘civilised artists have copied the designs’ might be a reference to people such as Margaret Preston, who had spent many decades exploring the ways in which Australian art might incorporate Aboriginal designs.
‘The most “primitive” artistic expression’: the case of Karel Kupka
The view that Aboriginal culture provided a window into former times and other places was also the basis for Karel Kupka’s 1965 book, The Dawn of Art. Karel Kupka was a Paris-based artist who,



244 Writing Heritage
during visits to Australia in the 1950s and 1960s, collected and studied bark paintings from Yirrkala. Kupka considered Australia as a kind of ‘living laboratory’ wherein the ‘dawn of art’ could be studied. In The Dawn of Art he wrote:
Over the last twelve years my search took me four times to Australia; I was looking for an art, living and practised in our own times, yet still related to the most ‘primitive’ artistic expression. The present study is the result of these journeys.110
He detailed the purpose for his research:
The object I set myself was to study evidence furnished directly by people whose present living conditions and way of life most closely approach those of the first man. While I had no intention of criticizing existing theories on the origin of art, neither did I wish to formulate new ones. All I wanted was to find out how far the existing theories correspond to reality, and to experience this reality as it can be found among the Aborigines of Australia. The very fact that I was aware of the existence of this art made me want to see it and collect specimens.111 I spoke with the artists, I listened carefully to their answers to my questions, and, most important of all, I observed them in the act of creation.112
In the years before his book was published, Kupka had been the subject of some criticism, predominantly by Fred McCarthy who later believed Kupka’s methods to have been faulty and dishonest. In 1958 McCarthy described Kupka’s work to a colleague, Andreas Lommel:
Karel Kupka is a French artist who spent some time – about six months or more – in Arnhem Land studying aboriginal art from the artist’s – not the anthropologist’s point of view. He had a very nice collection of paintings most of them on small pieces of bark. In actual fact, all bark paintings are made to order today in Arnhem



‘Free from European Influence’ 245
Land and it becomes a question of judging the quality of a particular painting to assess its value.113
Kupka’s proposed method of collecting bark paintings is outlined in a letter in 1963 from the anthropologist A. P. Elkin to Professor Barnes, who was then the Executive Member of the newly established Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies (AIAS). Elkin wrote:
Mr Kupka has been in touch with the Church Missionary Society, and has paved the way for visiting Oenpelli. With regard to obtaining paintings etc. from there for the Institute, he has arranged that he selects the artists and they paint: he, if satisfied with the results, packs the paintings and forwards them to the C.M.S. in Sydney, where he or a representative of the Institute unpacks them; and there the missionary authorities decide with us on price. Apparently there is much bargaining and selling going on at the Missions at present, and some way has to be found by which the natives, the Missions and the purchaser (ourselves) can be protected.114
McCarthy, however, became very concerned about what he saw as Kupka’s failings in regard to his collecting activities. In 1964 he recounted Kupka’s conduct to another colleague, Dr Simon Kooiman, Curator of Oceanic Ethnology at the Rijksmuseum vock Volkerkunde in Leiden, Holland:
On every count the man has proved to be unscrupulous – perhaps his most serious regression was to apply for funds to carry out research on art in Arnhem Land when his sole intention was to make a quick dash through the area and get as many specimens as he could. He actually applied for six months in the field and spent ten weeks there. He’s already held an exhibition in Rome and will be holding one in Paris shortly.115



246 Writing Heritage
McCarthy believed that Kupka, who had conducted AIAS-funded research to collect and document the bark paintings from Yirrkala, had breached an agreement with the Institute concerning his allocation to that organisation of a proportion of barks he had collected. McCarthy was of the opinion that Kupka had left Australia hastily, had taken the barks with him without a customs permit, and had then conducted a ‘campaign of vilification’ of the Institute. In his correspondence with colleagues McCarthy also questioned Kupka’s method of collecting the paintings, asserting that the artist had not spent the necessary time in the field, but had simply sped through the area picking up the paintings. Writing to Professor Jean Guiart in April 1964 McCarthy claimed that Kupka:
... (1) spent only ten weeks in the field occupied principally in collecting specimens and ascertaining their meanings, (2) did not examine museum collections, and (3) refused to share the documented collection of bark paintings to be made at Croker Id., Milingimbi and Groote Id. Missions which, he said, would suffice for the Institute. He refused to allow representatives of the Institute to examine his total collection whose value appeared to be between [£]1200 and [£]1500.116
This correspondence highlights the growing awareness among many Europeans of the need for proper conduct and respect for Aboriginal peoples’ rights and interests, and appropriate ethical approaches and standards in the ways in which researchers engaged with Aboriginal people and their cultures.
‘Before they disappear entirely’: the urge to collect
The Northern Territory, and Arnhem Land in particular, continued to be important for the collection, research, and production of Aboriginal art and other aspects of cultural heritage. Other areas, too, were also being considered for their potential to supply an ever



‘Free from European Influence’ 247
growing interest and demand for Aboriginal cultural materials. Lorna Lippman, then Acting Secretary of the Aborigines’ Advancement League in Victoria, wrote to Fred McCarthy in 1962 to inquire about the availability of Aboriginal artifacts. She outlined her organisation’s purpose in acquiring these:
Our organisation is anxious to obtain tribal works of art from different parts of Australia for display and sale in Melbourne. Our aim in this is two-fold: firstly to assist the tribal people in earning money; and secondly, to arrange art exhibitions which would help to make the public realize the mental and artistic capacity of the Aboriginal people. We would not consider it as a money-making venture for the League, but feel that the Aborigines themselves should benefit from the very real interest in bark paintings and carvings which exists here. We were wondering if you would be good enough to let us know whom we should contact for this purpose? Are there any areas other than Arnhem Land where Aboriginal art is still being produced?117
McCarthy replied:
I am afraid there are very few places in Australia in which genuine Aboriginal artifacts of artistic value are being produced apart from Arnhem Land. There is nothing to be obtained in northwestern Australia, where a few excellent wood carvings of human figures, in a flattish style, have been collected – some are in the National Museum of Victoria. There are prospects here of beginning the production of these figures if the right natives could be contacted and if they would be prepared to make them. They are ritual and they are very circumspect about this side of their life. The Yarrabah Mission is the centre of the interesting coloured shields, paddles and whirlers so well represented in museums, but whether these could be obtained on a commercial basis I do not know. It would be interesting to see the designs reproduced on bark



248 Writing Heritage
sheets but the promotion of such a scheme would have to be carefully handled. Otherwise there is nothing being done to nurture art for sale among the Aborigines.118
Lippman replied that ‘since it would appear that Arnhem Land is the only remaining area of production, we are more than ever anxious to obtain a collection, before they disappear entirely’.119 There was still at this time the notion that Aborigines were disappearing, only to leave the material remnants of their societies. While this passion for collecting Aboriginal cultural objects continued to occupy much of Europeans’ time, there was also by now a firmly entrenched interest in legislation for preservation.



Legislation for Preservation 249

Legislation for Preservation
As we saw with reviews of Mountford’s report of the 1948 Arnhem Land expedition, some Europeans had argued that collecting, documenting, recording and writing about Aboriginal cultural objects was, if nothing else, a form of preservation. In the context of what many Europeans still thought was a ‘disappearing’ Aboriginal culture, the production of a permanent record of Aboriginal culture in all its forms was regarded as increasingly important. Publication was one sure way to establish such a record; legislation was another, as that would, it was hoped, encourage preservation and prevent destruction. The calls for legislation for preservation and for the prevention of illicit export of Aboriginal cultural materials that had been voiced by some collectors, as well as by officials and others in earlier decades, were eventually to be translated into action. Although the representations made over a decade earlier to the Commonwealth Government to legislate for protection of Aboriginal heritage had not been immediately followed by action, by the early 1950s there were some stirrings of interest in bureaucratic circles. Developments by the United Nations and its agencies – particularly UNESCO – provided some impetus for the Commonwealth Government to consider the question of heritage protection.



250 Writing Heritage
In the 1950s the Australian office of UNESCO in the Commonwealth Office of Education kept an interested watch over relevant UNESCO proceedings. In 1951 the Acting Director of the Office of Education, W. J. Weedon, brought some of these developments to the attention of the Department of Territories:
In pursuance of resolutions of the Unesco General Conference relating to the preservation of the cultural heritage of mankind, our Unesco National Co-operating Body for Museums has urged that legislation be introduced for the preservation of aboriginal sites, human remains and relics.1
Once again, as seen earlier, this call for legislation sought to define the matter to be protected by means of a list of elements of heritage. Here the list is relatively brief, comprising only ‘aboriginal sites, human remains and relics’. However, the inclusion of ‘aboriginal sites’ was an important step towards recognition of place (in addition to moveable physical objects or ‘relics’) as a component of Aboriginal cultural heritage. The Department of Territories official, J. E. Willoughby, responded, claiming that ‘at present there are practically no known archaeological remains in the Territory’, but urging the reporting of any that ‘may be discovered in the future’. Willoughby suggested that the declaration of Aboriginal reserves in the Northern Territory had played a role in protecting heritage:
There is no direct legislation for the purpose of preservation of archaeological sites, but provisions for proclamation of aboriginal reserves indirectly aid preservation of antiquities and archaeological remains.2
In the discussions that continued over the years there was a geographical focus on the Northern Territory. The reason for this may have been twofold: as a Commonwealth territory the Northern Territory was an obvious focus for Commonwealth attention. In addition, many Europeans still held the view that the Northern



Legislation for Preservation 251
Territory was the locus for most of the ‘traditional’ Aboriginal societies. The Director of the Office of Education put forward a case for legislation:
In inviting your attention to the Committee’s resolution, I am sure that there is no need for this Office to stress the importance to the morale of primitive peoples of legislation which demonstrates a respect for the culture of their ancestors and helps to give them a sense of cultural continuity with the past.3
Although still couched in primitivist language, this statement, somewhat unusually for that time, articulates the importance of protecting heritage for the Aboriginal people themselves. It also presents a definition of Indigenous heritage as that which has continuity with the past, thus indicating a more dynamic sense of heritage.
Preserving Aboriginal sites: Ayers Rock
Weedon’s reference to ‘aboriginal sites’ signalled a growing recognition from the early 1950s that place was an important part of Aboriginal heritage. One place that gained some attention from government officials in this decade was Ayers Rock – or Uluru, as it is known today. This imposing Rock had of course been known for a very long time as a landmark of particular importance, though perhaps more as a major European–Australian landscape feature than as an Aboriginal sacred site. It was one of the Aboriginal reserves that had been established under the 1918 Northern Territory Aboriginal Ordinance and gazetted in July 1920. Anthropologists had worked in Central Australia over many decades and there was by now considerable knowledge about the Aboriginal communities there. Over time, population movements, European intrusions, mission and government activities, and drought had had a huge impact on the desert populations. By the



252 Writing Heritage
1950s some government officials were questioning whether there were in fact still Aboriginal people present at the Rock, and inquiring about the importance of Ayers Rock/Uluru to these people. Officials expressed these views in the context of increasing interest in this area by developers and tourist operators. For example, considering a proposal to build an airstrip at Ayers Rock, Frank Wise, the Northern Territory Administrator wrote in 1952 to the Secretary of the Department of Territories:
Ayers Rock is within the South-West Aboriginal Reserve, but the Director of Native Affairs advises that Aborigines do not reside in the area and that only travelling groups of them pass through the adjacent country which is mainly desert.4
The Administrator claimed that ‘no harm would be done to the interests of the Aborigines if the area adjacent to the Rock were excised from the Reserve’.5 However, the Minister for Territories, Paul Hasluck, sought further advice from the Territory administration and, in a memorandum to the Secretary of his Department, he wrote:
I am receiving various representations on the subject of Ayre’s Rock [sic] from persons who claim definitely that the site is still used by the aboriginals, and its preservation as an aboriginal reserve is vital to them. Please inform me of the present position in regard to the proposal to excise part of the reserve in order that it may become more accessible to tourists ... I should also like to have exact and detailed information about the number of aborigines which visit the area, and whether, in fact, Ayre’s Rock [sic] and its surrounds are of significance to them.6
The Territory Administrator claimed that the area was no longer significant to Aborigines:
... There are no aborigines residing in the area around Ayers Rock and Mount Olga, and only a very few natives now visit the area,



Legislation for Preservation 253
and such visits are usually only when hunting wild dogs for their scalps during the ‘dogging’ season from July to September in each year. Their purpose in visiting the area in this period is only to make use of the natural water near Ayers Rock. Although the cave and rock paintings indicate that it was formerly a native ceremonial centre this was for previous generations of aborigines, and the present generation does not visit or make use of the area for any ceremonial purposes. It appears therefore that Ayers Rock and its surrounds no longer have any religious or other significance for the present generation of aborigines ...7
Hasluck reiterated this view a few years later, in 1957. With growing concerns about vandalism and suggestions by some that the Rock should become a National Park, he wrote to Senator Walter Cooper, Minister for Repatriation:
There is evidence that although the cave and rock paintings at Ayers Rock indicate that the area was once an important native ceremonial centre, this no longer applies. ... there are very few natives in that area. It seems that the present generation of aborigines attaches little, if any, significance to the area and that it no longer holds any religious significance for them. The water supplies which exist there are not permanent and the hunting resources of the country are sufficient to sustain only small bands of nomadic natives.8
The language in this correspondence echoes that used by L. Keith Ward and A. S. Kenyon in earlier years in relation to tjurungas thought by Ward to be no longer ‘in use’ because the Aborigines were no longer seen to be using the tjurunga storehouses for ceremonial purposes. The prerequisite for an object or site being considered of importance as Aboriginal heritage was, it seems, based on its continued occupation or use by Aboriginal people. Despite his view that Aborigines no longer used Ayers Rock, Hasluck nonetheless recognised the need to tighten controls to



254 Writing Heritage
prevent vandalism, and the following years saw increasing interest in protecting Uluru as a National Park. Representations were made to the Commonwealth Government from international organisations keen to share their experiences in protecting natural and cultural areas and to offer assistance. One example was a letter in 1958 from Fred M. Packard, the Executive Secretary of the National Parks Association of the United States to the Australian Minister for Repatriation:
The National Parks Association of the United States is keenly interested in this suggestion because of the experience we have had in the country with the problem of destruction of our own aboriginal remains and especially the cliff dwellings of the Pueblo peoples of our ancient south west. The National Park Service, which is the agency of the United States Government which administers the national park system, has jurisdiction over eighteen national archaeological monuments which protect such sites. They were given this responsibility because the government considered such evidences of our native historic past to be of priceless value and felt that the only way they could be protected properly was under careful regulation and protection sponsored by the Government itself.9
This statement illustrates the importance attached to Indigenous sites and objects as national heritage in other countries. Discussions in official and government circles from the 1950s would increasingly adopt a similarly patriotic tone regarding preservation.
Northern Territory heritage legislation
The Northern Territory was the first jurisdiction to introduce specific legislation to protect Aboriginal heritage. From 1911, when the Commonwealth Government assumed control over the Territory, Ordinances were enacted for administering the Aboriginal populations of the region. Some of these, such as the Reserves



Legislation for Preservation 255
Ordinance, were occasionally cited by government officials as relevant to the protection of ‘antiquities’ in the Territory. By the 1950s a need for further legal control over Aboriginal heritage was acknowledged, which resulted in the introduction in 1955 of the Native and Historical Objects Preservation Ordinance. A press release issued by the Minister for Territories, Paul Hasluck, in January 1955 succinctly stated the objects of the new Ordinance:
The Minister for Territories, Mr Paul Hasluck, said today that, as a result of an Ordinance passed by the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory at its last session, it was an offence for any person wilfully or negligently to deface, damage or interfere with aboriginal ceremonial grounds and relics, including carvings and paintings, in the Northern Territory. It was also an offence to destroy, remove or conceal native relics, carvings or paintings or anything of ethnological or anthropological interest. The Minister stated that this was a stop-gap measure pending the introduction of a more comprehensive bill on the subject of the preservation of aboriginal relics, historical sites and natural features in the Northern Territory.10
However, in the years following the introduction of this Ordinance, there was a growing realisation that it did not allow for the protection of place – only objects. As one official remarked, ‘There is a growing need in the Territory for legislation designed to protect certain areas which are of interest from a number of aspects, viz., tourist, flora and fauna, scientific, historical, anthropological’.11 Eventually, in 1960 the Ordinance was amended to the Native and Historical Objects and Areas Preservation Ordinance 1960. The amendment was explained as follows:
This Ordinance widens the scope of the Native and Historical Objects Preservation Ordinance 1955 by the inclusion of sites and areas within the provisions of the Ordinance. This action was necessary as persons interested in historical or anthropological

investigation had found that certain caves and sites in the Northern Territory, which were not protected in any way by legislation, were being destroyed or damaged by vandals, or by persons who were not aware of their scientific or historical importance.12
The debate on the amended legislation in the Northern Territory Legislative Council drew some criticisms from members concerned at what they thought would be the ‘locking up’ of areas to nonAboriginal people. For example, Harold Brennan, representing Elsey, objected to the proposed Bill, referring to some caves at the town of Katherine. He complained, ‘I have been trying to find out what the caves are and I have been informed there are some small caves that have been found. You find these caves all round the countryside, no matter where you go, and if each one of these areas is going to be indiscriminately reserved there will be nowhere for us to go.’ He went on with this theme:
I notice the Director of Welfare said [there are] a number of caves in the Katherine area which are obviously of some ritual significance. This ritual can be carried to extremes. These caves – I have not found any ritual or known of any rituals taking place in them. ... But this word ritual can be carried to extremes because there is barely a part of the Territory, taking it all round, that at some time or other has not been used for ritual and so forth. ... You will find a lot of places where there are heaps of stones and I do not think anyone is worried about them, but they have some ritualistic significance, much more than the blinking caves, but if we are going to worry about those heaps of stones that have been put together by people through, I do not know how long the world has lasted – some say millions and others less. ... But if you are going to make it an offence for a person to just go and perhaps remove one of these blinking stones from that heap and use it to chock a wheel of a vehicle where you have pulled up, it is a bit of a farce. This is where bureaucracy runs wild.13



Legislation for Preservation 257
Most other members supported the amendment Bill. The member for Alice Springs, Mr Hargrave, welcomed the Bill, saying that ‘it has long been a problem to the Northern Territory Reserves Board what action is to be taken with respect to places of this nature with valuable, original, artistic and other types of records to preserve them from vandals and persons who remove them to other places’.14 However, another critic of the Bill was Mr Petrick, representing Stuart, who argued that ‘it can become dangerous ... that an area should be declared a prohibited area’. He explained his objections:
We have quite a few prospectors. A prospector does not read the Gazette and he finds himself in a prohibited area. It should be well left alone. I know that the Member for Alice Springs, if he says [sees] a red stone lying in the middle of a street, declares it an historical object. There should be a reason before anything is declared historical by experts and not by laymen. Many things are today declared historical. They are only as recent as yesterday and they are called historical. You find that weapons sold to the tourists are not worth a cracker because they are absolutely just mass produced today and mean nothing. I have got some of them here which are really weapons that come from a long way back, but you cannot get those weapons today because the blacks have found out how to make money easily – by selling tools that are rubbish. I feel we should treat this particular Ordinance very carefully and not overstep the mark ...15
In responding to the criticisms from Brennan and others, the Director of Welfare, Harry Giese, commented on the Bill:
I do not propose to follow the Member for Elsey into a definition of the term ‘ritual’. I admit, though, that I did use the term in the second reading speech somewhat loosely. There are a large number of areas in the Territory which have some ritual significance to aborigines and where there are relics of various sorts – whether paintings or carvings, whether burial grounds or initiation grounds or weapon-making grounds – which have an importance to them,



258 Writing Heritage
and I think we have a responsibility to these people to see that those areas are not desecrated. I am concerned because the Northern Territory is becoming known to quite a large number of people, anthropologists and others, as being an area where, by excavating certain of these ritual grounds, quite significant finds can be made.16
The Bill was duly passed, but the debate illustrates the way in which heritage protection becomes a contested domain. Throughout its history, the development and implementation of legislation for Indigenous cultural heritage protection has been a site for the playing out of varied interests, often centred on the conflicting notions of ownership and rights. A few years following the amended legislation, in November 1964, the Northern Territory Legislative Council established a Select Committee to inquire into whether any further amendment of the Native and Historical Objects and Areas Preservation Ordinance 1955–1960 was required. The Committee’s findings and recommendations presented in its report of 10 August 1965 were far reaching. The report began by noting ‘evidence of gross neglect and maladministration of this Ordinance by the Welfare Branch of the Northern Territory Administration’. It also claimed that ‘very few witnesses were aware of the existence of the Ordinance and, apart from officers of the Welfare Branch, no witness was aware of any application of the Ordinance’. Commenting on the operation of the Ordinance, the report stated that during the Committee’s investigation it ‘became aware of a vital principle of democracy which could be denied by the Ordinance’. It went on to explain:
The Aboriginals, as a minority group having different religious beliefs from the majority of the Australian population, are entitled to look to the Government for freedom to practise their religion and for protection from those who would desecrate their sacred objects. Your Committee believes that there should be no distinction between the desecration of a sacred object in a church or



Legislation for Preservation 259
temple and the desecration of a sacred object in a place held sacred by the Aborigines.17
The report had some firm opinions on the legacy of missions as well:
Your Committee believes that every effort should be made to preserve what is left of the Aboriginal culture. Our predecessors in the Territory, including over-zealous Christian missionaries, appear to have had little regard for the niceties of individual liberties in their anxiety to ‘civilize’ the Aboriginals. Your Committee was particularly disturbed to be told by Aboriginal witnesses that they were not permitted to use their ancient ceremonial grounds within a mission area and that they were not permitted to perform their ceremonies in the manner and at the times they wished.18
Commenting on tjurungas removed from the Northern Territory, and now mostly lost, the report described these objects as ‘links in a chain or perhaps more accurately as chapters in a story’. The report also recommended protection against unscrupulous activities by outsiders against Aboriginal artists. It detailed some of these:
Some evidence was heard concerning the lucrative trade in Aboriginal bark paintings. ... Allegations of large retail profits with small returns to the painters were made and one Aboriginal witness claimed that his people were refusing to paint any more barks for sale because of the small payment received for paintings which were sold in the capital cities for very high prices. In the interest of justice and fair play the bark painting industry should be carefully examined with a view to legislating for the protection of the artists and with the preservation of a high standard of painting.19
This comment is an insightful reference to concerns that became more prominent much later, during the 1990s, regarding the exploitation of Aboriginal artists. In the light of its findings the Committee recommended that the Ordinance be repealed, and replaced with ‘legislation ... to establish



260 Writing Heritage
a museum controlled by an independent board of trustees’. The ‘prime object’ of the trustees of this museum would be ‘the collection and preservation of material related to the history of the Northern Territory and the culture of the Aboriginal inhabitants’. Crucial recommendations were: that a Federal Government appoint an ‘expert committee to inquire into and make recommendations concerning the protection and preservation of the culture of the Aboriginals of the Northern Territory’; and that ‘the Legislative Council appoint a commissioner under the Inquiries Ordinance to investigate the production and sale of bark paintings by Aboriginals with a view to recommending legislation which will ensure that the individual artists receive an adequate proportion of the retailers’ prices’.20 One of the submissions to the Committee’s Inquiry was from T. G. H. Strehlow, and another from the Aboriginal Art Committee. Strehlow stressed the rights Aboriginal people held in their cultural heritage, as he wrote that ‘all things connected with the old religion of Central Australia – myths, songs, dramatic acts, and sacred objects – were privately owned’. He explained that the ‘sacred objects – known as tjurunga (and spelt churinga by you) symbolized the personal ties of living or dead human individuals to these supernatural beings’. Elaborating further, he stated that to the Aborigines these tjurunga:
were not regarded as remote archaeological or historical objects: they were ‘the secret bodies’ of the human beings believed to have been reincarnated from them: and they were hence the undisputed private property of these persons. If a man died, then his objects became the undisputed private property of his sons (or other heirs).21
On the basis of his extensive experience and knowledge of Central Australian Aboriginal life, Strehlow claimed that the Ordinance:



Legislation for Preservation 261
gives no indication that it recognizes the fact that all sacred sites were once regarded as being owned by all members born into the appropriate local totemic clan, and that all other persons – unless expressly invited to visit them by the headman of the totemic clan were regarded as trespassers meriting the death penalty.22
Strehlow believed the sections of the Ordinance that required the disclosure of objects to be an infringement of Aboriginal peoples’ civil liberties and a threat to their right to freely practice their religion. He wrote:
While the death penalty has been removed by our modern Australian laws, it is surely proper that in a country professing to guarantee religious freedom, the religious rights of the Indigenous inhabitants should be expressly protested in an Ordinance which deals, among other things, with sacred sites and sacred objects. If not only Christian churches, but also Jewish synagogues, Moslem mosques, and Masonic temples are protected against unauthorized entry and despoliation, why should not these ancient aboriginal sites be granted similar privileges? If any ‘outsiders’, such as missionaries, Government officials, or anthropologists wish to know something about them, surely they should carry out their researches only after they have been invited in the traditional manner by the appropriate totemic clansmen.23
Again, Strehlow’s observations echo the kind of sentiments others were to express in later decades, when recognition of Indigenous peoples’ rights emerged as a legitimate interest among some sections of the community. Ahead of his time, Strehlow’s observations also presage later debates (albeit within limited circles) about the importance of obtaining prior informed consent from Aboriginal people before conducting research in their communities. He suggested that ‘no person should be permitted to receive sacred objects except from their lawful aboriginal owners, and in the presence and with the approval of the remaining members of the appropriate local totemic



262 Writing Heritage
clan’.2 4 Strehlow’s critique presents a more sophisticated understanding of the inner life of Aborigines, of the interrelationships between the physical and the spiritual, and of the importance of Aboriginal culture and heritage as a ‘living’ force. Despite the recommendations concerning repeal of the Territory’s Ordinance, it appears that no immediate action was taken. Despite the inquiry, government officials and administrators continued to reflect on the adequacy of the Northern Territory Ordinance. The Minister for the Interior, Peter Nixon, remained relatively confident of the Ordinance’s capacity to provide adequate protection for sites of importance, as he wrote to Fred McCarthy in 1969:
Some sites have already been protected by action to place them under the provisions of the Native and Historical Objects Preservation Ordinance, and others have been included in reserves under the control of Territory Reserves Board. The Reserves Board, for example, has taken particular care to preserve the rock drawings in the caves at Ayers Rock.25
The Minister also indicated work that was being done on the compilation of inventories:
As you know, work on the compilation of a catalogue of sites has been continuing for several years in the Northern Territory and a new revised list is in course of preparation at the present time. This catalogue does not discriminate in importance between sites and probably records only some part of the total number of rock painting and engraving sites in the Territory.26
The Minister did, however, acknowledge a need for additional protection from development, stating that ‘an examination might be made of the need for special legislation to provide for the survey and rescue of material threatened by development projects’. While some Ministers were claiming the Ordinance provided satisfactory pro



Legislation for Preservation 263
tection, in parts of the Commonwealth bureaucracy officials were increasingly aware of the limitations of the statute. As one internal minute suggested:
... I have examined the provisions of the Native and Historical Objects and Areas Preservation Ordinance 1955–1961 with particular regard to the provisions relating to prescribed or prohibited areas. The clear conclusion is that the Ordinance is largely unworkable, especially in relation to areas declared as prescribed or prohibited areas. ... Obviously, the Ordinance as it stands is of little help in protecting sacred sites. In the circumstances, I suggest that we arrange early amendment of the Ordinance along the lines indicated in my draft memorandum to the Administrator ... In the meantime, survey of selected sites could be made. There could also be some advantage in putting up of notices warning the public that the areas are sacred sites. The public would probably not be aware that such notices were without any legal effect and the notices would show some indication of our good faith.27
This was a clear statement of the inadequacies of legislation for protecting sacred sites and places. Since the beginnings of European intrusion, the newcomers had been constantly challenged and perplexed by the concepts of sacredness, and the intangible aspects of Aboriginal cultural heritage. Although many perceptive observers and writers had long understood these fundamental elements of Aboriginal culture, the legislators and administrators were grappling with them within the domain of law and policy. The administrator’s acute observation that the Northern Territory law did not provide for protection of sacred sites foreshadowed what was to become (and remains to this day) an increasingly fraught area of legislative and bureaucratic activity.

Protecting place: an example from South Australia
As the debates and inquiries concerning the Northern Territory Ordinance show, protection of Aboriginal heritage raised important moral and metaphysical issues about rights, use, access and ownership. These issues became more prevalent as, over the years, other jurisdictions introduced heritage protection legislation. One example concerned a stone arrangement in South Australia, in an area that had been set aside for weapons testing. This site was the subject of correspondence in the mid-1960s from the newly established South Australian Aboriginal and Historical Relics Advisory Board, set up under the South Australian Aboriginal and Historic Relics Preservation Act 1965. Under this legislation, the Board sought to have an Aboriginal stone arrangement protected as a ‘historic reserve’. Robert Edwards, then Director of the South Australian Museum, wrote to Dr M. W. Woods, Director of the Weapons Research Establishment at Salisbury in South Australia, informing him of the introduction of the legislation and alerting him to the stone arrangement in question:
Professional and amateur anthropologists in South Australia have been concerned for many years about the steady deterioration of aboriginal relics throughout the State and the increasing amount of vandalism. After continuous agitation the Aboriginal and Historic Relics Preservation Act 1965 was passed by Parliament and gazetted on 3rd August 1967 ... The extensive ‘Stonehenge’ site, near Observatory Hill on the Emu Reserve, has been submitted as an important example of an aboriginal stone arrangement. ... The Board requests permission to declare a small area incorporating the site as an ‘Historic Reserve’ under the terms of the Act. This would in no way interfere with the present jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Government. ... Your assistance in these matters would be an important contribution to the preservation of what is part of our National Heritage.28



Legislation for Preservation 265
The Acting Chief Administrator of the Northern Territory, G. C. Agars, wrote to the Deputy Crown Solicitor on 4 January 1968 seeking advice as to what the effect would be of declaring the ‘Stonehenge’ site a reserve, given that the site was within ‘that piece of land in South Australia known as the Maralinga Prohibited Area declared under the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act, 1952’.29 However, as the site was found to be Crown land, it decided that the consent of the Commonwealth was not required in order to protect the site under the South Australian Act. The site was therefore proclaimed a ‘Historic Reserve’ on 30 May 1968, but it would still be subject to the Commonwealth’s rights and powers under the provisions of the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act.30 Robert Edwards described this site as ‘one of the finest and most striking of its kind yet discovered’.31 This legal debate shows the way in which Aboriginal sites, areas and objects could become entangled in the interplay of Commonwealth and State laws, and debates between different interests triggered by ‘findings’ of such Aboriginal cultural heritage objects, sites and areas.
Heritage as a catalogue: preservation by classification
By the late 1960s interest in the protection of Aboriginal heritage was growing, and by the end of the decade most states had either introduced protection laws or were considering doing so. In May 1968 the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies organised a conference on ‘Prehistoric Monuments and Antiquities’ in conjunction with its general meeting. The Institute’s Principal, Fred McCarthy, wrote to the Minister for the Interior, Peter Nixon, drawing his attention to the current status of protection legislation throughout the country, and providing him with a copy of the recommendations from the conference.32 The conference recommended that financial assistance should be provided for the recording and protection of sites in each State and Territory and



266 Writing Heritage
that ‘not all sites could be preserved, but that all sites should be recorded’. It recommended that a catalogue of sites should be compiled, and a ‘select list of important sites’. For the catalogue, the report outlined the following strategy:
It is suggested that in this first stage antiquities such as rock paintings and engravings, stone arrangements, axe grooves, ceremonial and burial grounds, marked or carved trees, coastal and riverine shell and other midden deposits should be visited to obtain the basic information required for the catalogue. On the other hand, surface campsites (strewn with stone implements often among fireplaces) are too numerous to visit on a State-wide basis and require detailed local surveys to list them completely. A library survey of published records and descriptions of all sites in a State would form a basis for the catalogue.33
This proposal for a catalogue reinforces the notion that in their endeavours to protect Indigenous heritage, legislators and administrators approached this task encyclopaedically by listing and documenting the heritage as a way of defining it. Rather than understanding this heritage as a concept, a way of living, it seems it could only be comprehended in terms of its constituent elements. The taxonomic approach reigned throughout the entire history of heritage protection. The catalogue suggested by the Institute’s conference report provides a good example of such classifying. It was also a means by which decisions were to be made about preservation. In recommending a ‘select list of important sites’ the report advocated that:
The catalogue should provide, or refer to relevant reports, that will enable a decision to be made about which sites should be proclaimed, reserved and protected as national monuments, and which ones could be utilized for tourist purposes. It is becoming increasingly urgent that lists of this nature be compiled because of the remarkable growth of tourist activities, and of the need to



Legislation for Preservation 267
exploit such sites for this purpose, and also because of the increasing danger to sites through vandalism and construction work.34
As was seen in some earlier writings, these comments also conjure up an image of Indigenous heritage being defined in terms of a Eurocentric hierarchy of priorities. As well, this document presents an important shift in the rationale for protection of Indigenous heritage. Although writers were, from the earliest times, concerned at the destructive potential of encroaching European settlement on Aboriginal places and objects, their primary motive in calling for preservation had often been the imminent ‘disappearance’ of Aboriginal culture. By the late 1960s the primary rationale for protecting Aboriginal heritage was not so much to save the physical remnants of a ‘dying culture’, but to prevent Aboriginal heritage from being destroyed or damaged by tourism, vandalism and development. The next chapters will examine the history of attempts to recognise the intangible elements of Indigenous heritage.

Sacred Sites as Heritage
The concept of the sacred
The sacred domain in Aboriginal culture is a crucial aspect of cultural heritage. This was understood in earlier writings by Spencer and Gillen, whose ground-breaking ethnographic works laid the foundation for anthropology and Aboriginal studies throughout the century. Anthropologist Kenneth Maddock charts the anthropological usage of the concept of sacredness. Following Durkheim, Maddock outlines the nature of sacred things as being ‘protected and isolated, hedged about with interdictions’.1 The term ‘sacred site’ has a specific connotation, linking this quality of sacredness with place. Maddock reviews the emergence of sacred sites, and the role of anthropology in Australia. He states that ‘after being coined by Strehlow and Elkin, the term “sacred site” waited almost twenty years to become prominent in anthropology’.2 From the late 1960s, notions of Aboriginal tradition and of sacred sites became more enmeshed in law and legal discourse.3 From early times explorers, prospectors and others had observed and remarked on the presence of an Aboriginal sacred domain. One such person was prospector Stuart Love who recorded his comments



272 Writing Heritage
during an expedition to Arnhem Land in 1910. Love noted evidence of Aborigines’ ceremonial practices:
Thursday August 11th – (A great many trees along this bank for the last mile were ringed with paint at a regular level of about 5 ft. from the ground. For the first half mile of this distance they were all ringed with red ochre. Paddy [one of the Aborigines with the party] informed us that this was in honour of some dead black fellow of importance.)4
Although the information provided by the Aboriginal guide Paddy indicated the Aboriginal peoples’ connection with the sacred, Love later sought the advice of anthropologist Donald Thomson on the meaning of the markings and, in a footnote added to his diary in 1948, he commented:
Donald Thompson [sic] informs me quite definitely that the red ochre markings would be to remove the ‘tabu’ on the hunting ground of an important member of the tribe, recently dead. The ‘tabu’, if not lifted, would prevent any other member of the tribe hunting over that area. ... He is not certain about the white markings, but thinks that they were most probably connected with the ‘White Maggot Totem’, which is held in particular respect by the tribes on the estuary of the Koolatong River ... and in connection with which white markings are always used ...5
Love’s observations of the Aborigines’ marking-out of the landscape in significant ways implies recognition of the sacredness imbued in Aboriginal peoples’ relationships to the land. Others, too, noted the existence of a sacred domain in Aboriginal culture. W. F. Murphy, a mining engineer who participated in a prospecting expedition to Arnhem Land in 1912 known as the Caledon Bay Prospecting Expedition, noted this in his diary. While camped near Rose River on Monday, 5 June, Murphy described an Aboriginal burial site:



Sacred Sites as Heritage 273
We camped last night in the vicinity of a native sepulchre which is in a cave in a cliff just opposite our camp. Its weird hieroglyphics and paintings on the walls of the cave are exceedingly interesting, the bones of the departed are deposited in dilly bags made from fibres of pandanous [sic] leaves along the ledges of the cave and on raised platforms built from the bush timber. It is customary with the natives in these parts to exhume the body of the dead some time after death when all the bones are scraped quite clean, then the disjointed frame is placed in the dilly bag which in turn is wrapped up in a layer of paperbark securely tied with string mostly made from human hair and then placed in the sepulchre or as they may be frequently seen in the bush they are jammed into the fork of a tree.6
Murphy’s writing depicts Aboriginal cultural expressions as bizarre and exotic in his description of ‘weird hieroglyphics and paintings’. Although constrained by his value-laden language and inappropriate terminology, Murphy is nonetheless clearly impressed by the powerful presence of an unseen domain of Aboriginal cultural life. It would be some decades before the idea of sacredness as a vital aspect of Aboriginal heritage would emerge more explicitly in legal and policy discourses.
Sacredness and place
The concept of sacredness could not be fathomed without regard for place, and Aboriginal people’s notion of place as a sacred space was to provide a particular challenge to administrators and legislators. Although this sacred domain was not fully appreciated by officials, some anthropologists had long recognised its importance. However, the connections between place and heritage, and recognition by European-Australians of the significance of these to Aboriginal people, often only became apparent in the context of threats to specific sites or areas from development, tourism and other Euro



274 Writing Heritage
pean activities. One example of this concerned a waterhole in Central Australia. In 1936 physical anthropologist John Burton Cleland participated in a University of Adelaide expedition to the Granites, in South Australia’s Northern Territory. On his return he wrote to T. Paterson, Minister for the Interior, expressing concern about sites and areas of importance to Aborigines that he thought might be threatened by the activities of prospectors:
Native soaks and waterholes are few. This country is traversed from time to time by prospectors. The natives in this area tend to gravitate naturally towards the settlement at the Granites where they come in contact with white people, get a certain amount of European food, put on clothes (to their considerable disadvantage), and soon become detribalised. ... Advantage would accrue if it were possible to prevent the approach of natives to the Granites and to Tanami closer than, say, 10 miles. On the other hand, such a prohibition might cut off the native soaks and ceremonial places, both of which are essential in keeping the native alive and preventing his detribalisation.7
Cleland was particularly concerned about a waterhole site that he thought had special significance to the Aborigines, and which was threatened by the activities of a prospector and pastoralist named Braitling:
I understand that Mr Braitling has taken out under the Mining Act the right to the waters of a place called Tjilla (Jilla). This name means The Spring, indicating that it is one of the most important waters to the natives, and it is also an important native totemic centre. As there is no mining in the neighbourhood and as this is a native water, it does not seem clear why this permit was granted. Having been granted, I do not know whether under the Mining Act it can be revoked. I presume the permit has to be annually renewed, and as there seems to be no reason under the Mining Act for granting it, I would recommend that it be not renewed at the end of the year. I understand that he [Braitling] has timbered this water



Sacred Sites as Heritage 275
hole. It is very necessary to see that no interference is made with the natives in their access to the water.8
Here Cleland highlights not only the importance of water as a natural resource vital for the survival of Aboriginal people, but of waterholes as places of profound spiritual significance. Significance here is constructed within a domain of threat – in this case, by pastoralists’ activities. In the coming decades sacred sites were to become a matter for considerable attention by government officials and others.
Recording sacred sites
As earlier chapters showed, a growing consciousness emerged in bureaucratic and administrative circles of a need to document and protect Aboriginal sacred sites. This need assumed a greater urgency in the mid-1960s, prompted by bauxite mining interests in the Northern Territory, in Queensland and in Western Australia. The claims of Aboriginal people became more prominent in the public arena in 1963 when the Aboriginal people of Yirrkala, on the Gove Peninsula in Arnhem Land, sent a writ to the government expressing concerns with the proposed bauxite mining and exploration interests. That writ and a subsequent inquiry by the Parliament were key factors in encouraging the urgent recording of sacred sites and discussions about protection. In 1964, partly in response to the events at Yirrkala, Ronald and Catherine Berndt, who had been conducting research in that area for many years, carried out a survey of sacred sites. Ronald Berndt explained this work:
My aim is simply to demonstrate the major importance of certain sites which are an integral part of the religious system of these people and represent, in visible and tangible form, their traditional heritage. Further, arising from the consideration of this is the significant question of Aboriginal land rights.9



276 Writing Heritage
The Berndts’ survey was an important basis for discussions on sacredness and sacred sites, especially by administrators and politicians. These discussions in turn were critical in debates on protection and preservation. The Berndts’ survey was expanded over the years, and prompted a discourse that became focused on matters such as the actual status of particular sites, the kinds of sites that might be included in surveys and lists, and the range of options for protection. The following 1968 exchange between responsible Ministers conveys the flavour of some of these discussions:
For the past eight years the Northern Territory Administration Welfare Branch has been compiling information on sites of Aboriginal interest, particularly those containing rock paintings or engravings. A list of known paintings and engravings produced in January 1968 is attached for your information. ... The information in the list relates to important traditional sites some of which might be regarded as semi-sacred only. The status of the site, insofar as an Aboriginal group is concerned, is used as a guide to the action that should ultimately be taken in respect of the preservation of the site. Where there is a risk of sites being damaged or destroyed action has been taken to protect and preserve them. A substantial number of sites in the attached list is afforded some reasonable protection because they are within Aboriginal reserves. A difficulty in giving the sites the status of protected or prohibited sites under the appropriate Northern Territory Ordinance is that an exact survey is a prerequisite for this purpose. Survey work has been carried out on certain sacred sites on Gove Peninsula and eventually these sites will be gazetted either as prohibited or protected sites. It is intended to include local Aboriginals either as rangers or persons authorised by the Administrator to give permission to enter a prohibited area. ... Apart from painting and engraving sites there are many other sites of Aboriginal interest in the Northern Territory which could be listed and given some form of protection. Some of these, of course, such as natural features, may have no interest at all for non-Aboriginals.



Sacred Sites as Heritage 277
The task of identifying and recording all sites in the Territory is a major one which will take a long time and, in my view, calls for certain skills and experience.10
This detail illustrates the way in which bureaucracy approached Aboriginal heritage protection through a systematic classification and taxonomy of sites. Here we see a description of this kind of ordered process of listing and compiling, categorising and classifying, and a proposal for a program for surveying identifying sites for protection. All these activities, the writer states, required certain kinds of expertise – thereby foreshadowing the introduction of an authoritative structure within which certain experts would manage, control and determine the existence and management of Aboriginal heritage. This description also established a duality of roles for, and values held by, Aborigines and non-Aborigines respectively. The Aborigines, whose heritage was the object of this elaborate system of control and management, would, in this scheme assume a subsidiary role to the white administrators and bureaucrats. While purporting to allow Aborigines the right to ‘give permission to enter a prohibited area’, the plan envisaged that ultimate authority rested with the Administrator. Aborigines may also act as rangers – a role in which they might have the opportunity to apply their customary knowledge of, and practices relating to the sites and areas – but within a system that was controlled by predominantly nonIndigenous administrators and bureaucrats. It is worth noting, too, that the writer suggests some sites, ‘such as natural features’, ‘may have no interest at all for non-Aboriginals’. There is in this comment a notion that there are discrete Aboriginal and nonAboriginal domains of interest relating to sites of significance. Curiously, ‘natural features’ that may be of interest to Aborigines were assumed to be of no interest to non-Aborigines. What, then, of natural features that were considered to be worthy of preserving in national parks and the like as ‘natural heritage’? Were these likely to be of no interest to Aboriginal peoples? These assumptions about



278 Writing Heritage
Indigenous and non-Indigenous heritage create false dichotomies that further serve to diminish Europeans’ capacity to understand the totality of Aboriginal heritage, while also cramping the opportunity for Aboriginal people to have control over protecting and defining their heritage.
The role of the expert: anthropologists, administrators and Aborigines
Other writers seemed to understand better the value of enabling Aboriginal people to take a more significant role in the recording and protection of their sites. In 1968 Fred McCarthy wrote to the Minister in charge of Aboriginal affairs, W. C. Wentworth, outlining some elements of types of sites and detailing some aspects of their recording and preservation:
The Welfare Branch in Darwin has a catalogue of rock paintings and engravings, and stone arrangements, in the Northern Territory, of which it has issued roneoed lists. Macassan camps, excavated prehistoric deposits and other sites are included in the lists ... It is probable that every social anthropologist who has worked in the Northern Territory has some notes on sacred places in the mythology and ritual data recorded, but the information is scattered through notebooks. Unless the plotting of the sites by them was extensive a new survey would be necessary in each area ... ... The work involves traversing the whole of the territory of clans/local groups with Aboriginal men who still know the sacred sites, the most numerous of which are the natural rocks, hills, trees, waterholes and the like. An anthropologist would need to spend up to six months with one group visiting their sacred sites with guides to record case histories of them in the context of the mythology of the group. Over 100 named tribal groups are represented in the Territory each with a large number of clans (many no longer exist), and it is obvious that many years of research are involved in the total project. Further, as the Aborigines have left their tribal terri



Sacred Sites as Heritage 279
tories to live on government and mission settlements, cattle stations and elsewhere, and many of them no longer visit these sites, only a partial map may be compiled. ... To short-circuit the time involved in recording the mythology, the Aborigines could be asked to supply the names of the sacred sites for mapping purposes, and this procedure would be justified for administrative purposes. Many of the sacred places are revealed as the Aborigines relate their mythology about totemic and spirit centres and the travels of their spiritual ancestors, but the site would have to be visited to be mapped. I have stressed the scientific value of mapping sacred sites in my address to the general meeting, May 1968, of the Institute, and in other documents circulated to our members. Inquiries have revealed that social anthropologists will study Aboriginal religion, mythology and songs, and the relevant ceremonies, in a theoretical context, but they are not interested in straight out mapping and listing of sacred sites as this work does not merit higher degrees. Strehlow is an exception, but his mapping of place and sacred site names is part of a lifetime’s study of Aranda culture.11
Although McCarthy seemed to describe a greater role for Aborigines in the work of surveying and recording sacred sites, ultimately it was the anthropologists who, in his approach, still held the authority over this work. While Europeans were busy surveying, recording and listing Aboriginal sites, it was not apparent for whom this work was being carried out. Was it for the benefit of the Aboriginal people, or in the interests of western science? Were these sites thought of as elements of national heritage? Some of these issues are illustrated in a Department of the Interior memo from the Northern Territory Administrator to a Mr Donovan, which sought to provide a typology of sacred sites:
One useful distinction could be made between sites which we wish to preserve for our own reasons, regardless of Aboriginal views, and sites of special interest to Aboriginals. In the first category come all,



280 Writing Heritage
or virtually all, rock painting and engraving sites i.e., the sites, and others like them, listed in the Welfare Branch check list. Generally these do not appear to be sites which come to Aboriginal minds when one enquires about sacred sites. At Groote Eylandt for example the two places the Aboriginals insisted must remain inviolable would be of no interest to non-Aboriginals, being natural features of no special interest. Burial caves and areas are of interest to skull-measurers and souvenir hunters and generally Aboriginals show some concern that they are not disturbed. Probably relatively few of the painting galleries would be regarded by Aboriginals as especially sacred.12
The writer went on to suggest that other attempts to classify sacred sites tended to be too inclusive:
Definition of what constitutes a sacred site is difficult. Professor Berndt, in his survey of the Gove Peninsula area and in his address to the AIAS meeting last May seems inclined to put virtually every locality with mythological associations in this category. The recording of all such sites would not just be a long, expensive and difficult task, it would be impossible for all practical purposes.13
Notwithstanding this difficulty, the task would be more feasible if sites were faced with threat of desecration or vandalism, as the writer put it:
Location of areas of special significance to Aboriginals or of scientific etc., interest in limited areas which are in some way threatened by development – whether mining, tourist, residential or whatever – is difficult but not impossible.14
Like bureaucrats, Ministers were also grappling with issues of categorisation and measures for protection of sacred sites. Their concerns were equally quantified in terms of available resources, time constraints and practicality – but with more of an eye to the political scene. The Minister in charge of Aboriginal affairs, Bill Wentworth, wrote to his colleague Peter Nixon, Minister for the



Sacred Sites as Heritage 281
Interior, in May 1969, enclosing a copy of the Berndts’ Gove site survey report:
I think the report illustrates the difficulty and complexity of this whole matter. I note that it was made some three years ago and it may not be adequate towards meeting the present situation. It does, however, seem to me to be a very worthwhile job ... This whole subject is going to cause great difficulty not only at Gove but throughout the whole of the Northern Territory both because the accounts given by Aboriginals themselves in good faith may not always be coherent (and, indeed, sometimes may be in conflict) and also because of the tendency amongst Aboriginals to exaggerate for political purposes or simply to inflate importance beyond what is justified.15
This comment reifies the kind of pejorative views that questioned the veracity and validity of Aboriginal perspectives. Sadly, even to this day this kind of rhetoric enables those in power to sustain their supremacy over Aboriginal peoples’ narratives, and to legitimate their denial of Aboriginal peoples’ control of their own heritage.
A greater role for the Commonwealth
By the late 1960s the shape of Aboriginal affairs administration was changing dramatically. A referendum in 1967 had resulted in an amendment to the Australian Constitution that gave the Commonwealth Government greater control over the administration of law and policy for Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders. Following this, the Commonwealth Government established a Council of Aboriginal Affairs (CAA) which reported to a newly established Office of Aboriginal Affairs within the Prime Minister’s Department. This new structure enabled a greater focus on Aboriginal affairs generally, and also provided a milieu within which Aboriginal cultural aspects could be given a higher profile. One consequence of the new structure was a converging of interests in



282 Writing Heritage
Aboriginal arts with those in land, sacred sites and heritage protection. The chairperson of the CAA was H. C. (‘Nugget’) Coombs, who had long held an interest in Aboriginal art, and was a strong advocate for Indigenous rights among his many other high-profile activities. By the late 1960s officials were becoming increasingly interested in the idea of legislating for protection of Aboriginal art. Unusually for that time, there was a proposal to develop legislation that would protect both art and sacred sites at the one time. This was outlined in 1969 by Coombs in a proposal to Wentworth:
The Aboriginal people of Australia have a unique tradition and practice in the arts including
• Painting and sculpture • Ceremonial, drama, and dancing • Weapons and other artifacts
In the main these arts are closely involved with the activities and ceremonies of their tribal life and therefore are threatened by changes taking place in the economic and social pattern of their lives. It would, however, be a great loss not merely to the emotional and cultural life of the aboriginal people but to the whole Australian community if these arts were to be lost or to be wholly depreciated. Nevertheless it is unlikely that they will preserve their freshness and vitality on which much of their quality depends if they are preserved simply as museum relics or if they become a depreciating adjunct to the tourist trade.16
Coombs’ proposed legislation would serve to:
• establish property rights in certain works of art, designs, areas of religious, ceremonial, ritual, artistic and tribal significance to the aboriginal people; • vest these property rights in a Trustee and by his delegation to corporate bodies;



Sacred Sites as Heritage 283
• provide for the protection, development and, where appropriate, economic exploitation of these property rights in the interests of the aboriginal people; • provide for the preservation and development as living arts the traditional arts and crafts of the aboriginal people; • protect the work of aboriginal citizens in these arts from imitation and unreasonable commercial practices; • provide aboriginal artists and craftsmen with effective marketing opportunities for their products.17
Coombs went on to explain:
For this legislation to be effective, however, requires in the Council’s opinion a study of the present state of these arts and the development of a conscious strategy for preserving them as an integral part of the lives of aboriginal citizens and of enabling them to adapt, without breach of tradition or continuity, to the changing content of those lives. This may, of course, raise the difficult question of whether aboriginal ceremonial life and the traditional social purposes and disciplines which it expresses, can retain any sense of reality in contemporary Australia. The Council wishes, therefore, to establish a committee to study the present state of the arts and crafts of aboriginal peoples of Australia and to recommend policies designed to preserve and develop them as significant elements in the cultural life of the Australian people generally. ... The Committee should have power to co-opt for the whole or part of its deliberations aboriginal Australians active in their arts or crafts or concerned with their ceremonial or other significance in tribal life.18
The legislation would enable the following to be designated as ‘Traditional Aboriginal Property’:
• work of art • ritual, ceremony, dance or drama • record in any form of such ritual, ceremony, dance or drama



284 Writing Heritage
• design • area of land
The proposed legislation would define such ‘Traditional Aboriginal Property’ as follows:
to be a traditional aboriginal property: provided that it shall so recommend only when it is satisfied after due enquiry that the property concerned by tradition is and/or has been identified with and is and/or has been of cultural ritual, artistic or similar significance to a tribal group or groups of aboriginal Australians.19
This was a far-reaching proposal, seemingly designed to capture the intrinsic connections between art, land and sacred sites, and to recognise these as integral elements of a category designated as ‘Traditional Aboriginal Property’. At the same time, and within the same spirit, there were also debates about the inadequacies of laws in protecting the rights of Aboriginal artists, and the levels of royalties that should be paid to those artists. One example of these debates is contained in correspondence from Barrie Dexter, in charge of the Office of Aboriginal Affairs, to the Department of the Interior in September 1968. Dexter wrote:
You will recall that since the meeting of the Standing Committee of Officers in 1966 consideration has been given to the question of royalties on Aboriginal songs, dances, music, etc. ... Action was first taken by the former Department of Territories and more recently this Office has been pursuing the matter. ... The Council for Aboriginal Affairs considers the position unsatisfactory. It proposes shortly to have this Office conduct a study of possible ways of preserving Aboriginal arts and crafts as living activities. Part of that study will be considering possible ways of establishing property rights for individual Aboriginals and ethnic groups in design, music, artifacts, etc. and of protecting such property rights to ensure that commercial benefit is reserved to those in whom property is vested.20



Sacred Sites as Heritage 285
In the next decades these debates would continue, and, influenced to some degree by international developments, would also search for new language with which to articulate these ‘property’ rights of Aboriginal peoples. The following chapter surveys these attempts to define and incorporate Aboriginal intangible property into the legislative and policy arenas.

Writing Heritage as Property
Debating property: different laws, different concepts
The emerging concerns by administrators, policy makers and academics over protection of Aboriginal art, and the connections that some people recognised between art and sacred sites, marked a shift in focus to intangible aspects of Indigenous heritage. They also signalled a focus on the question of whether the European concept of property was properly applicable to Aboriginal culture and heritage. The suggestion that some kind of property rights were fundamental to Indigenous cultures had been articulated by Strehlow in his submission to the 1965 inquiry into the Northern Territory Native and Historical Objects and Areas Preservation Ordinance 1955–1960 (see above). Other observers, writers and ethnologists had commented at times over the decades on the notion that Aborigines had property rights in certain areas, sites (such as ochre quarries) and objects. But this idea was not yet readily accepted or understood by the dominant political and legislative system. The Yirrkala writ in 1963 showed that Aboriginal people were by now increasingly politicised, were asserting their rights and interests in land, and demanding their right to participate in the political



Writing Heritage as Property 287
process. Developments during the 1960s and 1970s culminated in the Gove land rights decision by Justice Blackburn of the Northern Territory Supreme Court in 1971.1 Although that decision failed to uphold the claimants’ Aboriginal property rights in land, it nonetheless paved the way for a series of developments that eventually resulted in the country’s first law recognising Aboriginal peoples’ rights to land in the Northern Territory in 1976. Land and property were now firmly on the political and administrative agenda for discussions and debates in Aboriginal affairs. This was an important achievement, but there remained unresolved some difficult questions regarding the nature of Indigenous property rights, and especially concerning the kinds of rights that vest in the intangible aspects of Indigenous culture.
Protecting the unseen
By now many Europeans were aware that there was a domain of cultural heritage that, while not visible to the casual eye, was no less fundamental to Aboriginal culture and society. Among the most frequently observed expressions of this unseen world were performances of ceremony and song, dance and various forms of ritual behaviour. While mostly respectful towards such performances, Europeans found aspects of these, and other areas of Indigenous cultural life, to be imponderable. The term ‘cultural and intellectual property’ is sometimes used today to refer to these aspects of Indigenous culture, particularly to those elements that do not strictly encompass land, and cannot be clearly identifiable within the rubric of ‘relics’ or ‘antiquities’ – to use the language of earlier debates. Underpinning cultural and intellectual property is the concept of ‘property’, which itself may provide a key to elucidating links between heritage, land and the invisible, spiritual life of the Aborigines.



288 Writing Heritage
Exploring Yolngu concepts of property
In debates and discussions on land and sacred sites it was not clear to policy makers, legislators and others who were grappling with these issues whether the notion of ‘property’, as this was understood in a conventional legal sense, was readily applicable to Indigenous cultures. In the Gove decision, Justice Blackburn found that the Aboriginal plaintiffs had a profound relationship to their land, but that this was not, in these circumstances, construable as a ‘property right’ in the commonly understood western legal sense.2 The judge also found that the clan – the primary Aboriginal land-owning group – could not be considered a corporate entity for the purposes of holding property rights. However, where the legal system was at that time unable to accept that Aboriginal land-owning groups could hold property rights in land, in the views of some anthropologists such group rights were clearly discernable in Aboriginal societies. Anthropologist Nancy Williams, for example, claims that the judge ‘never saw the clan as more than an indeterminate collection of individuals, and no statute provided for the vesting of title in such a collectivity’.3 After examining Yolngu concepts relating to title, possession, and occupation and use, she concluded that ‘the Yolngu system of land tenure is characterised by groups which, in terms that common law can comprehend, are corporate with respect to their interests in land, and that those interests are proprietary’.4 Williams suggested that the problem lay in cultural translation, arguing that ‘seen in historical context, English concepts of ownership, interests in land, suggest that the concepts themselves are at issue, rather than whether Yolngu concepts can or cannot be equated with common law concepts’.5 This problem of translating Indigenous concepts into a language familiar to western law and policy lies at the heart of any discussion about recognising Indigenous cultural heritage as a whole system, rather than as a series of discrete components. The formulation and administration of the



Writing Heritage as Property 289
Aboriginal Land Rights Act illustrates some of the problems in the cross-cultural translation of concepts, categories and behaviours (such as humans’ relationships with land and environments).6
Property and Indigenous cultural heritage
The western legal concept of property is based on the notion of individual (or legally defined corporate) rights and ownership. Yet the terms ‘cultural property’ and ‘intellectual property’ are often used to denote aspects of Indigenous cultural heritage underpinned by various kinds of group rights. How can a legal system based on principles of individuality accommodate difference and recognise the rights of certain kinds of groups that cannot be easily translated into the required legal concepts? A firmer understanding of Indigenous notions of heritage may be achieved by understanding such group rights, and finding an appropriate language within which Indigenous concepts can be properly accommodated in western law and policy. Critic Amanda Pask suggests that a shift in terminology from ‘cultural property’ to ‘cultural heritage’ might provide a context in which cultural property law becomes more amenable to appreciating the intangible components of heritage.7 As Pask suggests, the term ‘cultural heritage’ conveys more of a sense of a cultural whole than does ‘property’. In her view this unity, or ‘community’, is fractured and fragmented by western legal systems in which the various fragments are denoted by labels such as ‘cultural property’:
The unity of the issues with which this discussion began – the appropriation of Native intellectual property, cultural property, land and bodies – lies in the preservation and production of communities, indeed of nations. The blindness of the legal system to this unity, apparent in the fragmentary and fragmenting character of its responses, is both to Native peoples as communities, that is, the questions of standing at international law, and in



290 Writing Heritage
domestic law the inability to account for anything between the individual and the universal ‘public’, and to the dynamic character of the links which constitute community, apparent in the refusal to see culture as communication rather than as information.8
Other writers have also highlighted the ways in which western legal discourses fracture the unity of Indigenous cultures.9 For example, Aboriginal writer Henrietta Fourmile suggests that ‘all current Aboriginal heritage legislation, from an Aboriginal viewpoint, is defective in serious ways’.10 She draws attention to the ways in which the legislation and administration of Indigenous heritage results in fragmentation of this heritage:
While particular pieces of legislation are required to protect and foster what might be loosely referred to as the ‘artistic’ aspects of non-Aboriginal culture, one of the consequences of responsibility for the maintenance of Australia’s cultural heritage being divided up and given under legislation to various authorities is that likewise major parts of our heritage are similarly divided up and administered under different departments. While this situation might be appropriate for the wider society it has the effect of dismembering Aboriginal cultures and results in the marginalisation of our concerns within the institutional structures of the dominant society. We lose control, we cannot assert our priorities, and we are unable to effectively command and manage our own cultural resources.11
Fourmile’s critique highlights ways in which legislating for Indigenous heritage has fractured what is meant to be protected. The next chapter further explores this fragmentation, then reviews some possible attempts to restore this heritage as a whole cultural system.

Making it Whole Again: Towards an Inclusive Heritage?
For most of the twentieth century Europeans saw, recorded and commented on stone and wooden weapons, utensils and implements; on artistic products including rock engravings and paintings and bark paintings; and on expressive aspects of Aboriginal culture such as dance and ritual performances. For the most part they wrote as though the particular element they were describing was a discrete entity, unrelated to other aspects of Aboriginal culture. Although they could generally only see parts of a whole cultural system, from the early part of the century some Europeans also recognised that there were other, perhaps deeper aspects to the observed objects, behaviours and performances, and that these spoke of another dimension to Aboriginal life. The existence of this intangible aspect – what might be termed ‘the sacred’ – was acknowledged by a few writers at times throughout the century. It was not until the later part of the twentieth century, however, that writers and observers began to recognise that these different aspects of Indigenous heritage – the physical and the intangible – were inextricably linked. Also at this time there emerged a growing consciousness of the importance of protection for cultural heritage in a wider sense, and of this



292 Writing Heritage
heritage comprising a wider range of aspects of Indigenous culture than had previously been thought. One of the challenges to understanding heritage as an inclusive concept was to find a language to describe both its tangible and intangible aspects. The attempts to develop ways of protecting the Aboriginal arts and crafts industry illustrate some of these challenges. The growth in the Aboriginal arts industry through the 1960s and 1970s had prompted debates about how to protect the rights and interests of the artists to ensure that they received adequate returns for the sale of their works, and to promote the maintenance of high quality art. The struggle was to develop the Aboriginal arts industry as a viable economic entity that would allow artists to reap the financial benefits, while also recognising the need to sustain this art as an integral part of Indigenous cultural heritage. The proposal for ‘traditional properties’ legislation by the Council for Aboriginal Affairs in 1969 was an early attempt to draw together some of these threads. Although that proposal did not proceed, acknowledgment of the need for such legislation remained, at least in some circles. In 1981 there was a further attempt to legislate to protect a body of Indigenous cultural products, expressions and performances, this time under the terminology of ‘Aboriginal folklore’. Once again, this initiative arose from within the arts-related domain of Aboriginal affairs. This development had begun in May 1973, with a National Seminar on Aboriginal Arts held in Canberra that resolved:
That the Australia Council’s newly formed Aboriginal Arts Board should initiate procedures which would enable each tribal body to protect its own particular designs and works and to strictly control the use of them by non-Aboriginals.1
Following that resolution, a Working Party was established, initially within the Attorney-General’s Department, to ‘examine the nature of legislation required to protect Aboriginal artists in regard to Australian and international copyright’. The first meeting of the



Making it Whole Again 293
Working Party was held on 28 October 1975. By 1979 ‘it became clear that substantial issues beyond copyright were raised’, and the Working Party was eventually transferred to the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment. The Working Party then ‘directed its attention to the nature of Aboriginal folklore and to finding an appropriate way of protecting it’.2 Among the matters the Working Party was to consider were ‘legislative protection of Aboriginal artists and folklore’, ‘special protection for certain types of works such as sacred-secret materials’, and ‘matters of proof and the relationship between Aboriginal and Commonwealth laws’.3 The impetus for the Working Party’s inquiry came from the growing number of instances of unauthorised use of Aboriginal art and designs. As the Working Party Report explained:
There has been widespread use of Aboriginal designs taken from original works by Aboriginal artists. Reproduction for commercial purposes has included the manufacture of tea-towels, wall-hangings, postcards and a range of souvenirs. In the majority of these instances the artist’s consent to reproduce was not obtained and no royalties were paid. Some of the motifs were of a sacred nature and their reproduction caused grave offence not only to the artist but to particular Aboriginal groups. Although there have been instances of communications between commercial enterprises and Aboriginals or communities concerning the payment of royalties for the use of Aboriginal designs and works this has not been common practice.4
The Report outlined the nature of the problems raised by this exploitation of Aboriginal art:
The resolution passed by the National Seminar was based on the principle that the traditional arts and crafts of the Aboriginal people are their own cultural property from which they should benefit and which they should be able to control. The question of translating such a principle into Commonwealth law raises issues concerning every facet of Aboriginal cultural expression:



294 Writing Heritage
• How are such expressions to be defined and categorized? • Which uses are to be permitted or forbidden? • Would the principles of copyright and design law provide a protection? • Would additional legislative sanctions be necessary to ensure an effective scheme?5
In discussing the ‘nature of Aboriginal folklore’, the Report considered several aspects. These included: the ‘Dreamtime’ (more commonly called ‘Dreaming’ today) as a reference that sanctions Aboriginal beliefs and actions; the transmission of ‘themes through Aboriginal folklore’ over generations; societal rules governing the creative process; the sacred qualities of some Aboriginal folklore; and the complexities of ownership in Aboriginal societies. The Report also discussed the important issue of ‘ownership’:
Although the nature of ‘ownership’ is complex in both Aboriginal and Western societies, a general difference between them is discernible. Whereas in Western society ownership of a work of art may usually be transferred from one individual or group to another by a commercial transaction, in Aboriginal society differentiated rights over a work of art are generally distributed over several individuals and groups of individuals.
The Report concluded that ‘particular patterns of rights over cultural property vary from place to place. In some cases rights may be vested in clans; however, these rights may reside with other groups or individuals depending upon local traditions.’6 This indicates a relatively sophisticated understanding – possibly influenced by anthropology – of some of the complexities of Aboriginal cultures and societies. Another matter the Working Party discussed in its Report was the concept of ‘folklore’ itself. Although aware of the problem of using the term ‘folklore’ to refer to a body of Aboriginal beliefs,



Making it Whole Again 295
traditions and practices, the Report maintained use of the term, as it explained:
Use of the term ‘folklore’ recognises that traditions, customs and beliefs underlie forms of artistic expression, since Aboriginal arts are tightly integrated within the totality of Aboriginal culture. In this sense folklore is the expression in a variety of art forms of a body of custom and tradition built up by a community or ethnic group and evolving continuously.
The Report acknowledged that ‘the word “folklore” in the proposed legislation could be subject to several misinterpretations’. Explaining this further, the Report went on:
The word is not used narrowly to refer to oral literature only, as it is sometimes used. Nor do we mean to imply that Australian Aboriginals possess a rudimentary, unsophisticated artistic tradition; nor that Aboriginal artistic traditions are static or even dead, when in fact they are constantly renewed; nor that Aboriginal ‘folklore’ bears a close historical relationship to surrounding artistic traditions similar to that found, for example, in Europe or South America.
Despite this range of possible uses inappropriate to Aboriginal culture, the Report justified its decision to adopt the term ‘folklore’:
Notwithstanding the influences on each other of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal traditions in Australia, we recognise that Aboriginal arts constitute a distinct and sophisticated tradition in its own right. Nevertheless the word ‘folklore’ has been adopted as a compromise meeting the conceptual and international legal requirements for such a term.7
In deliberating the nature of proposed ‘folklore’ legislation, the Report discussed the apparently competing objectives of preserving ‘folklore’ as part of a continuing tradition, and encouraging the economic interests of Aboriginal artists.8 The proposed Act would also establish a mechanism in which claims by Aboriginal people



296 Writing Heritage
regarding use, or possible use, of their ‘folklore’ could be assessed and recommendations made to the relevant Minister. An advisory body (‘the Aboriginal Folklore Board’) would also be established.9 The Working Party Report and its proposed legislation were brave attempts to define and protect a body of Aboriginal cultural expressions, ideas and practices as a whole entity. By proposing a scheme by which Aboriginal people would be compensated for the use of their ‘folklore’ through receipt of benefits, the Working Party foreshadowed suggestions and proposals that were still only at the discussion stage many years later. Although the use of the term ‘folklore’ was problematic, the model was advanced for its time.10
Breach of trust: Mountford’s indiscretion
That Indigenous peoples had certain rights in designs, images, and secret and sacred aspects of their cultures had been recognised by some European writers and observers over the decades. At the same time, there was also a growing realisation of the importance of respecting these rights in practice and in relationships with Aboriginal people ‘in the field’. This was especially important in the context of observing and recording sacred and secret sites, ceremonies and objects. Instances in which Europeans had explicitly ignored Aboriginal peoples’ rights, and shown lack of respect for their customary rules and protocols regarding their culture, are too numerous to mention. The theft of tjurungas by members of the 1894 Horn Expedition was just one example of this cultural exploitation. Another instance came to public attention during the 1970s, although the events that led up to it had occurred some decades earlier, in the 1940s. In 1940 Charles Mountford travelled through Central Australia recording aspects of Pitjatjantjara and Jankatjatjara culture. At the time it seemed that the Aboriginal people among whom Mountford had worked had taken him into their confidence. They ‘showed him



Making it Whole Again 297
and explained to him sacred sites and objects, paintings and rock engravings, and he recorded their myths and totemic geography by aboriginal drawings, the camera and the notebook’.11 Mountford later published the results of his studies in his 1976 book, Nomads of the Australian Desert. In that same year, in the Northern Territory Supreme Court, Justice Muirhead heard a case in which representatives of the Pitjantjatjara people sought an injunction to prevent Mountford’s book being sold in the Northern Territory. The plaintiffs claimed that the publication and display of information they had given to Mountford in confidence during his visit to their country in 1940 was a clear breach of the trust with which they had provided the information. Justice Muirhead found that this information had ‘deep religious and cultural significance’ to the plaintiffs. He found that ‘some of the matters hitherto secret are revealed in the book, and that this had caused dismay, concern and anger’. ‘The revelation of the secrets to the women, children and uninitiated men’, Muirhead said, ‘may undermine the social and religious stability of their [the plaintiffs] hard-pressed community’.12 Since Mountford declined to withdraw the book from sale, the judge granted an injunction to the plaintiffs to allow them to prevent the sale of the book. That case was significant in that it was one of the first instances in which Aboriginal people had brought to the courts their rights to protect the sanctity of their culture. The court case Foster v Mountford also established the by now firm realisation that the visible or tangible manifestations of Aboriginal culture and heritage were closely interrelated with the intangible, and that these components were nested within a complex cultural system. For many decades these interconnections had often been articulated solely with regard to art. The next years were to see a critical re-evaluation in which Aboriginal art works came to be viewed increasingly not only as objects of aesthetic interest or as physical things. The designs and images in these works were now also being considered for what they might reveal about Aboriginal



298 Writing Heritage
peoples’ special connections to country, and their ritual and spiritual lives. For example, Fred McCarthy wrote in the third edition of his book Australian Aboriginal Rock Art in 1979:
The Aboriginals’ aesthetic self-expression is culturally conditioned. Sources of inspiration are derived from their religion with its dynamic and absorbing rituals, their mythology of bush spirits and folklore about colouration, shapes and habits of animals, magic, death and its threat to group unity and safety, tribal laws and discipline laid down by the ancestral spirits of the Dreamtime, economic life, fighting, and aesthetic impulse.13
McCarthy recognised the cultural and heritage values in art, stating that ‘the Aboriginals utilise art in many ways to perpetuate ideas and tribal knowledge’. He wrote that ‘art is an essential ingredient of Aboriginal life, with both psychological and ritual values, and is not pursued mainly for art’s sake and certainly not for wealth’.14
Protecting art as ‘intellectual property’
The 1970s was a crucial decade in terms of a growing realisation by Europeans of the dangers of unauthorised uses of Aboriginal cultural products and expressions. By the beginning of the new decade the Report of the Working Party on the Protection of Aboriginal Folklore, and the case of Foster v Mountford had created a milieu in which the need for a closer look at ways of protecting Aboriginal culture was becoming critical. The legislation proposed by the Working Party did not proceed, and yet again Aboriginal people faced a growth in the exploitation of their cultures. Given the popularity of Aboriginal art, the exploitation of this domain of Aboriginal cultural activity brought the problems of protection to public attention over ensuing decades. Developments during the 1980s and 1990s highlighted the need to protect these works of art not only as physical objects of aesthetic interest, but, perhaps more



Making it Whole Again 299
importantly, as expressions of Aboriginal peoples’ spiritual and cultural life. During this period conventional intellectual property rights law – mainly copyright and breach of trust – was used several times by Aboriginal people as a means of seeking redress for the inappropriate uses of their traditional designs and images. Traditional clan-based designs and images were being reproduced indiscriminately on tea-towels, currency, carpets and tourist souvenirs by an ever-hungry market and its suppliers and agents. The wronged Aboriginal artists used copyright and trade practices law to claim damages and to assert their cultural rights in their designs and images.15 The use of these intellectual property laws was effective in bringing the problem of infringement of Aboriginal cultural rights to the attention of policy makers and legislators, and in extending the interpretation of existing intellectual property law. But it left unresolved the deeper problem of providing effective recognition and protection for a class of specific Indigenous cultural rights as yet unacknowledged. Although framed within the discourse of ‘intellectual property’, what Indigenous people were seeking to protect was their cultural heritage.
Legislating heritage: the 1980s
The 1967 referendum that gave the Commonwealth Government constitutional power to enact legislation for Aboriginal people was a major turning point in Aboriginal affairs. It was instrumental in enabling significant legislation to be introduced over the ensuing decades. The Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976 (NT) was one important step in the legislative protection and recognition of Aboriginal culture, acknowledging land as the foundation for Aboriginal peoples’ maintenance of their culture and identity. Legislation for national protection of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage had still to be achieved. Such an Act eventually became law with the passage of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait



300 Writing Heritage
Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984. This Act enabled the Commonwealth Government to protect significant Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander sites, areas and objects for which state and territory laws were unable to provide effective protection. The Commonwealth Act was used as a ‘last resort’, where state and territory protection laws had proved inadequate, and it allowed for temporary protection by means of declarations over areas, sites or objects that were faced with threat of injury or desecration. This Act was subject to a comprehensive review in 1996 by Justice Elizabeth Evatt. During the mid- to late 1990s the Act came increasingly into the public arena as a result of several high-profile cases involving sites or areas that were subject to claims for protection. One of these cases in particular, known as the Hindmarsh Island Bridge case, highlighted powerfully some of the major flaws in present laws for protecting Indigenous heritage. Partly in response to the Hindmarsh Island Bridge case, as well as to the Evatt Review, the Commonwealth Government commenced its own review of the Act in 1996, which resulted in a series of proposals for comprehensive amendment. That process had not been completed as this book went to press. By the 1980s there were other Commonwealth laws that could be used to protect certain aspects of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural heritage. One of these was the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act, introduced by the Commonwealth Government in 1986. This Act was enacted as Australia’s fulfilment of its international responsibilities under the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illegal Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property. The Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act was designed principally to prevent the illegal export and import of items of ‘movable cultural heritage’. The introduction of this Act had been preceded by a series of inquiries and reports into aspects of Australia’s heritage, including a 1974 inquiry into the National Estate and a 1975 inquiry on



Making it Whole Again 301
Museums and National Collections.16 The outcomes of those inquiries gave further impetus to the growing acceptance of a need to protect national movable cultural heritage, including the concept of a National Register.
A review of the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act in 1991 defined ‘the cultural heritage of humanity’ as ‘any manifestation of cultural activities which has survived from the past’.17 The protection of Aboriginal cultural heritage is mentioned:
Australian Aboriginal heritage is particularly precious – because it is so valuable to contemporary Aborigines and their culture and, increasingly, to non-Aboriginal Australians, and also from a scientific viewpoint, in which it can tell us about the way humans lived in the past.18
In 1988 Cabinet had approved amending Regulations to this Act which established a control list of categories of Australian protected objects.19 Categories of heritage are defined in terms of their suitability for export, and the extent to which permits may be required in order to export or import them. The 1991 review brought to light further considerations about the nature of heritage, and discussion about the control list.20 The review report recommended, among other things, that Aboriginal sacred and secret material should be classed as prohibited from export, explaining that:
Given the importance of sacred and secret ritual material to contemporary Aboriginal culture, it is considered that there is a need for such objects to be protected from indiscriminate exposure to persons to whom Aboriginal people consider such exposure is inappropriate or dangerous.21
The formation of classes of objects in terms of their suitability or otherwise as export items perpetuates the classifying approach to Indigenous heritage. It is consistent with the tendency over the decades for Europeans to come to terms with defining and pro



302 Writing Heritage
tecting Indigenous heritage by means of classifying and categorising it. The compilation of lists, catalogues, inventories and legislative regulations are all examples of this classifying machine at work. As well as introducing laws protecting specific ‘types’ of heritage, such as Indigenous heritage or ‘movable’ heritage, in the 1970s the Commonwealth Government was also moving towards protection of ‘national heritage’. Shortly after it gained office in 1972 the Whitlam Labor Government began to call in policy speeches for consideration of national heritage protection, framed in terms of the ‘national estate’. Although the terms ‘heritage’ and ‘national estate’ were in currency earlier, they became more prominent as part of the discourse of policy and legislation in the 1970s.22 Following a committee of inquiry in 1974 and further discussions, new legislation (the Australian Heritage Commission Act) was introduced in 1975 establishing the Australian Heritage Commission, charged with responsibility to ‘identify, conserve, improve and present Australia’s National Estate’.23 The National Estate was defined as ‘those places, being components of the natural environment of Australia or the cultural environment of Australia, that have aesthetic, historic, scientific or social significance or other special value for future generations as well as for the present community’.24 The Australian Heritage Commission did not include objects in the composition of the National Estate. Places are assessed in terms of their significance, defined in terms of their ‘strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons’.25 Although a great many places and areas of significance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were listed on the Register of the National Estate, this provided only limited protection. The National Estate, although important, nonetheless shows that once again heritage was defined by an encyclopaedic approach that had been the basis of much heritage discourse over the century. In 2004 the Commonwealth Government introduced a new system for Australia’s national heritage, with



Making it Whole Again 303
protection now to be provided under a series of laws replacing the previous arrangements. Although the Register of the National Estate has been retained, the new Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Act 2003, and Australian Heritage Council Act 2003 have replaced the Act that established the Australian Heritage Commission. A heritage advisory body now exists in place of the Commission, and a National Heritage List, decided by the Minister, provides protection for nominated places, under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. These changes signal a far greater intervention by the Commonwealth Government and the relevant Minister in national heritage, including Indigenous heritage.
Towards self-determination: the establishment of ATSIC
By the end of the 1980s there were further developments in the administration and control of Indigenous affairs, with the establishment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) in 1989. ATSIC replaced the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and was a significant step towards enabling Indigenous peoples to govern their own affairs. ATSIC provided a decentralised, representative Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisation empowered to make decisions for, and on behalf of, Indigenous peoples. A Board of Commissioners was the supreme decisionmaking body advising the Commonwealth Government, with Commissioners as elected representatives of communities throughout the country. From its inception until 1999 (when this responsibility was transferred to the Commonwealth Environment and Heritage Department), ATSIC had responsibility for administering the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984. This was an important responsibility, as it signalled – in principle, at least – that Indigenous peoples themselves would now



304 Writing Heritage
be in control over decisions concerning their culture and heritage. In practice, the relevant Minister still had ultimate power over decision-making in respect of Indigenous heritage. Following its decision in April 2004 to abolish ATSIC, that organisation subsequently ceased to exist. All programs, policy and legislation for Indigenous affairs is once again ‘mainstreamed’ across all government departments and agencies. The unique opportunity that ATSIC gave Indigenous people to articulate their own needs, views and aspirations, and to represent themselves both within Australia and internationally, is no longer.
Full circle: the 1994 Stopping the Rip-Offs paper and beyond
Decades of failed attempts to protect Aboriginal culture as a whole body of beliefs, practices, values, expressions and objects did not prevent governments from trying again. In October 1994, acknowledging the need to find ways to protect the intangible aspects of Indigenous heritage, the Commonwealth Government released an Issues Paper called Stopping the Rip-Offs: Intellectual Property Protection for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. That Paper had some merit in that it was yet another endeavour to seek ways to protect aspects of Indigenous culture that were not adequately protected under existing laws. But for all its good intentions, the Issues Paper was flawed in its overly narrow approach to Indigenous cultural heritage. Grappling with terminology, the Paper used the term ‘arts and cultural expression’ to ‘describe the particular kinds of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture and heritage under discussion’. Although the term ‘arts and cultural expression’ was possibly a slight improvement on ‘folklore’, it was questionable whether it adequately reflected the totality of cultural performances, areas, sites, knowledge and expressions for which protection was sought. Apparently unable to stray beyond the



Making it Whole Again 305
boundaries of copyright law in exploring possible measures for improved protection of aspects of Indigenous culture, the Issues Paper limited itself to the ‘artistic’ domain of Indigenous cultural activity. It was within the safe and familiar realm of copyright law that the authors of the Issues Paper felt most able to find solutions to the puzzle of protecting Aboriginal culture. After all, copyright law had so far, in the public arena at least, provided the most readily available ‘remedy’ for redressing the exploitation of Indigenous art works. The Issues Paper explained its rationale for using the term ‘arts and cultural expressions’, and sought comments:
The term is intended to encompass all forms of artistic expression which are based on custom and tradition derived from communities which are continually evolving. We would welcome suggestions for other terms that may be more appropriate.26
Stating its limitations more clearly, the Paper claimed that it ‘is principally concerned with the role of copyright, and where relevant designs law, in protecting the ownership and integrity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander arts and cultural expressions’.27 Drawing the boundaries tightly around the subject matter to be considered, the Paper stated:
Other areas such as biodiversity and Indigenous knowledge are sometimes considered to be protected by intellectual property laws. However, these areas often touch on aspects of intellectual property protection without involving property rights themselves. This paper discusses those aspects of the protection of arts and cultural expression that have a close connection with copyright law.28
Here was the dilemma: the Issues Paper professed to be concerned with finding ‘a better way to protect and promote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander arts and cultural expression’, but did not seem prepared to step outside the framework of the existing Copyright Act. It seemed extraordinarily proscribed: any suggestions for protection



306 Writing Heritage
measures would be welcome, as long as they related to the Copyright Act only. Yet the Paper did include among the suggested options for ‘addressing the limitations in present protection’, in addition to amendments to the Copyright Act, amendments to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, and ‘special legislation’.29 Thus while inviting comments and suggestions for protection that went far beyond the ambit of the Copyright Act, it would remain to be seen to what extent such suggestions would be considered seriously. Despite its flaws, the Stopping the Rip-Offs Paper created an impetus for others to begin to examine more comprehensively the issue of Indigenous peoples’ ‘cultural and intellectual property rights’. By now there was a growing body of studies and reports that examined the inadequacies of existing intellectual property laws for recognising Indigenous forms of ‘intellectual property’, and explored ways of finding means to recognise and protect Indigenous rights.30 In the mid-1990s a study was commissioned by ATSIC and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies to respond to the Stopping the Rip-Offs Paper. That resulted in 1998 in the groundbreaking report Our Culture, Our Future: Report on Australian Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property Rights.31 Guided by international developments, Our Culture, Our Future used as a basis for its discussion a more holistic view of Indigenous cultural heritage, declaring that ‘“Indigenous cultural and intellectual property rights” refers to Indigenous Australians’ rights to their heritage’. The report explained that:
Heritage consists of the intangible and tangible aspects of the whole body of cultural practices, resources and knowledge systems developed, nurtured and refined by Indigenous people and passed on by them as part of expressing their cultural identity.32
Our Culture, Our Future became an important reference point for calls to reform legislation, policy and administration to provide for



Making it Whole Again 307
recognition and protection of ‘Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property’. The exploration of ways in which there could be recognition of what might be regarded as an emerging new class of fundamental Indigenous rights was now apparently more firmly on the agenda for discussion.33
A distinct class of rights: Mabo and native title
Another avenue that offered the potential for recognising a more complete sense of Indigenous cultural heritage began to emerge in the early 1990s. In 1992 the Australian High Court handed down a decision that was to change the face of Australian law. The Mabo decision recognised the existence of Indigenous native title in common law.34 It overturned the previously held doctrine that Australia was, at the time of European settlement, an unoccupied land, or terra nullius. The Native Title Act 1993 (Cwlth) gave formal recognition to the Mabo decision in statute law and established a process for determining claims to native title. The Mabo decision and the Native Title Act 1993 entrench in Australian law recognition of the special relationship Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have with their country. In theory, this also offers a framework for considering the expressions, knowledge and products of Indigenous peoples’ culture as things that are not separate from land, but rather, integral to it. There was now the opportunity for non-Indigenous Australia to appreciate the profound relationships between Indigenous land, culture, and cultural products and expressions. The Native Title Act does not itself provide any rights, nor does it protect culture or heritage, but it does provide a framework for the development of protection measures. Nonetheless, despite the opportunities that native title has potentially brought for such recognition, in the years since the Mabo decision the focus has been more on processes of resolving native title claims, rather than on considerations of the content and meaning of native title.

Owning heritage: competing views and claims
One of the matters that continued to perplex policy makers and legislators in contemplating protection for Aboriginal heritage was the question of its ‘ownership’. Although this theme had been discussed in earlier decades, by the 1980s, with Indigenous peoples’ voices now more often heard, it was once again a subject for debate and discussion. Heritage is commonly associated with ‘the past’, and it was in this sense that a 1983 symposium pondered the question of ‘Who Owns the Past?’.35 In her Introduction to the published papers from that symposium, archaeologist Isabel McBryde outlines the relationship between ‘the past’, the question of ‘ownership’, and ‘heritage’:
If we ask the question ‘who owns the past?’, accepting that we have but this ephemeral perception of past reality, the answer may be swift and brutal – ‘everyone or no one’. The question seems as elusive as the past. Yet in legislative responses to the question, especially as applied to the tangible remains from the past, we find a clear and consistent assumption. This assumption (embedded in legislation pertaining to sites and artifacts), is that these constitute the common heritage of all. In Australia it is found in both federal and state legislation.36
McBryde points out that this notion of ‘world heritage’ underpinned Commonwealth heritage legislation. This sense of the past as the heritage of all was translated into the idea of a physical site of heritage interest becoming a ‘national symbol’.37 But the idea of a national heritage was not new, as official documents surveyed earlier in this book often referred to Indigenous heritage collectively as ‘national monuments’. McBryde states that ‘some of the earliest arguments for national policies of heritage protection were couched in terms of the site as both symbol and patrimony’.38 She also describes the way in which these sites sometimes become ‘symbols of collective cultural identity’, citing Kutikina Cave on Tasmania’s



Making it Whole Again 309
Franklin River as an example of such sites for Tasmanian Aboriginal people.39 The notion of sites, areas and objects as ‘world’ or ‘national’ heritage has been increasingly challenged over the decades since the legislative acts of the 1980s, with claims by Aboriginal people for the rights of ownership and control over what they regard as their heritage. Archaeologist John Mulvaney contributed to the ‘Who Owns the Past?’ symposium by arguing in support of the role of museums and ‘science’, while also claiming that the collection and preservation of objects by Europeans has benefited Aborigines:
It is relevant, also, that museums are a Western institution. Aboriginal society held different values, and rather than collecting and storing artifacts, these often involved the destruction of creative works immediately following their use in ceremonies, or upon the deaths of their owners. ... Except for the case of certain sacred items, therefore, preservation of the material past for the instruction of future generations was not a feature of Aboriginal culture. Consequently, Aboriginal people may come to acknowledge the good fortune that European collectors preserved fragments of their cultural heritage.40
Mulvaney has been a consistent advocate for the value of Indigenous heritage – including human skeletal material – to archaeology and science. He argued that ‘it is necessary to emphasize the scientific importance of ancient bones of any race, and of the medical, dietary and cultural inferences which may flow from their analysis’.41 Mulvaney acknowledged the crucial role for museums, universities and other western research institutions in collecting and preserving Indigenous heritage, and argued that Aborigines are custodians of their cultural heritage (as distinct from ‘owners’).42 Indigenous writers such as Ros Langford have offered a very different perspective on ‘ownership’ of heritage. Langford identifies what she regards as issues of ‘conflict between the science of



310 Writing Heritage
archaeology and the Aboriginal people’.43 She eloquently states her case:
The Issue is control. You seek to say that as scientists you have a right to obtain and study information of our culture. You seek to say that because you are Australians you have a right to study and explore our heritage because it is a heritage to be shared by all Australians, white and black. From our point of view we say you have come as invaders, you have tried to destroy our culture, you have built your fortunes upon the lands and bodies of our people and now, having said sorry, want a share in picking out the bones of what you regard as a dead past. We say that it is our past, our culture and heritage, and forms part of our present life. As such it is ours to control and it is ours to share on our terms.44
The issue of ‘ownership’ of Indigenous heritage identified by Langford and others was by the 1980s no longer a subject merely for quiet contemplation or for academic debate. It became increasingly a subject for disputes as the competing interests of supporters and proponents of development, and advocates for Indigenous rights, struggled to assert their ground.
Indigenous heritage defined by adversity
The question of Aboriginal claims to sites as heritage has occasionally received a high public profile, particularly at times of conflict. One example of this was the Tasmanian Dams Case. In 1983 the Commonwealth Government invoked its constitutional powers to prevent the Tasmanian Government proceeding with a planned hydro-electric power scheme that would have resulted in the destruction of important World Heritage wilderness areas on Tasmania’s Franklin River. At the heart of this issue were some Aboriginal sites located in caves on the river. Arguments by archaeologists and others for protection of those sites was an important factor in the intervention by the then Hawke Labor



Making it Whole Again 311
Government to prevent the hydro-electric scheme going ahead.45 The Tasmanian Dams Case illustrates the ways in which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage has typically been defined as a locus of claims and counterclaims in a contested domain of development and ‘progress’. This constructs Indigenous heritage as something that is intrinsically defined as a site of adversity and division.
Indigenous heritage defined by competing truth claims
Another example of Indigenous heritage constructed as a site of adversarial relations is that known as the Hindmarsh Island Bridge case. This had its origins in 1989, with a proposal by developers to build a bridge between the mainland of South Australia and an adjacent island known as Hindmarsh Island or Kumarangk.46 Applications for protection of areas thought to be of continuing significance to Aboriginal tradition were lodged with the Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in 1993, 1994 and 1995. This development proposal, and the consequent Aboriginal claims, became the subject of an extensive series of legal processes, inquiries and litigation. The case highlighted the inability of Federal and State laws and processes to handle information of a highly sensitive and confidential nature to Aboriginal people. It also brought into the public arena contested notions of the nature of Aboriginal cultural sites and information, and raised important questions about the capacity of the dominant legal and political system to understand and accept the legitimacy of Aboriginal oral evidence. The role of women’s knowledge became a particular issue during the lengthy Hindmarsh Island Bridge debates and discussions.47 The Hindmarsh Island Bridge case also illustrates the lack of capacity of prevailing legal, political and administrative processes to provide adequate mechanisms by which Indigenous heritage can be protected as a whole entity comprising not only the physical, but also the



312 Writing Heritage
intangible, including knowledge of a confidential and particular kind.
A summing-up
Europeans have tended to see, record, describe and think about Australian Indigenous heritage not as a whole body of objects, beliefs, knowledge and practices. Rather, they have engaged with this heritage in terms of its discrete parts, as bark paintings, rock carvings, stone and wooden implements and weapons, or songs, dances and ceremonial performances. That is not to say that many writers failed to understand that the objects and performances they saw, described and collected were all somehow interconnected, and both flowed from, and in turn informed, a spiritual dimension of Indigenous life. But when writers, observers, collectors and others began calling for the preservation of Indigenous culture, their focus was mainly on the physical, tangible objects that had for so long fascinated and challenged them. Ceremony, song and dance was also seen to be in need of preserving. But these were preserved on sound and film recordings, mostly as distinct features of Indigenous life in themselves, without immediate recognition of their living cultural contexts or relationships with other elements of heritage such as cultural objects. This fragmented approach to writing about Indigenous heritage has persisted well into present decades, as policy makers and legislators continue to grapple with the concept of an Indigenous heritage that is an inclusive body of knowledge, traditions, objects, performances and beliefs. Europeans’ writings about Indigenous heritage over the last hundred years or more have shown a concern with particular themes. Dominant among these has been a search for ‘authenticity’, a presumed need to preserve objects and expressions of culture as ‘relics’ of a ‘lost or ‘disappearing’ people, and anxieties about defining, classifying and cataloguing Indigenous heritage. Although



Making it Whole Again 313
underlying motives and intellectual pre-suppositions have changed, many of these themes continue to guide Europeans’ writings and discussions about Indigenous heritage today.

1 The concept in anthropological and other writings of a ‘traditional’ Aboriginal society as one that was essentially unchanged, and whose lifestyle was thought to be maintained intact from before European contact is criticised by James Urry, for instance, who argues that it should be abandoned as not applicable to observed Aboriginal societies, since it denies change and adaptation.

Although there are some important distinctions between ‘archaeology’ and ‘prehistory’, using the term ‘archaeology’ does not resolve this dilemma.
