Section 1. Divodāsa Bharata wins Dvi-dāśarājñá, battle of 20 kings and gain control of riverine waterways



5
The victor is Divodāsa Bharata. Śrnjaya (king of the people of Daivavata) and TrtsuBharata are allies of Divodāsa.
19 other combatants who were defeated by Divodāsa are:
Bheda भेद (and allies Aja, Śigru, Yaksu युक्ष ), Śambara, [Śuṣṇa शुष्ण , Pipru, Varcin
(Vrcivat वृचीवत् )], Turvas'a तुवमश, Yadu, KaraÑja, Parnaya पिमय, Vangrida, Kutsa, आतु, Tūrvayāṇa,Namuci mara, Gungu, Salva
Divodāsa Atithigva, also called Pijavana is the father or grandfather of Sudāsa. Divodāsa is protected by Indra and the Aśvins in the Rigveda, RV 1.112.14; 1.116.18).He is the son of Vadhryaśva RV 6.61.5.
Patronymic connects Pratardana Daivodasi with Divodāsa, the ancestor of Sudāsa
Another son of Divodāsa of Kaśi is Pratardana. Divodasa is mentioned in the Kauśitaki Upanishad A king of Kas'i surnamed Pratardana is also called Dyuman, Śatrujit, Vatsa, Ritadhvaja and Kuvalayaśva.
Divodāsa was invited to the As'vamedha Yajna performed by King Daśaratha of Ayodhya. He was the younger brother of Queen Sumitra and was a Brother-in-law of Daśaratha. He was also the son of King Bhimaratha and was a grandson of Lord Dhanvantari. Divodāsa narratives link up रार्ायि and र्हाभारत ? Are there two Divodāsa or only one?
Dhanvantari as per the hymn (RV 10.179.2), the founder of the Indian school of medicine called Ayurveda.
Could the date of Divodāsa be 5th m.BCE, coterminus with the date of Sri Rama?

Rivers)
Saptasindhavah 'seven rivers' are:

1. Sindhu 2. Sarasvati Panjnad composed of 'five rivers':
3. Vitastā 4. Asiknī 5. Paruṣṇī 6. Vipāś 7. Śutudrī
These rivers are identified clearly in Schwartzberg Atlas map as Saptasindhavah region; I submit that this is the region where Rgveda people called Bhāratam Janam (RV 3.53.12) lived. I also submit that Bhāratam Janam are the people referred to as Meluhha in cuneiform texts of Ancient Near East of ca. 4th/3rd millennium BCE. One good example is the Su-ilishu Cylinder seal which shows in Akkadian cuneiform text, a Meluhha interpreter.
RV 2.12.12
यः सप्तरश्मिवृमषभुस्तणवष्मानवासृजत्सतमवे सप्त णसून्धन् । यो रौणहिु स्फर्रिज्रबाहुर्द्ामर्ारोहूंन्त स जनास इन्द्रः ॥१२॥
Wilson translation RV 2.12.12: He, the seven-rayed, the showerer, the powerful, who let loose the seven rivers to flow; who, armed with the thunderbolt, crushed Rauhiṇa when scaling heaven; he, men, is Indra. [The seven-rayed: the seven rays, raśmayah = seven forms of Parjanya (Taittirīya Āraṇyaka 1.9.4-5), or Indra, as the rain-cloud; or seven kinds of rainclouds].
RV 4.28.1
त्वा युजा तव तत्सोर् सख्य इन्द्रो अपो र्नवे सुस्रतस्कः । अहन्नणहर्ररिात्सप्त णसून्धनपावृिोदणपणहतेव खाणन ॥१॥
Wilson translation RV 4.28.1: Through that friendship, Soma, which has united you with your (friend) Indra, he has made the waters flow for man; he has slain Ahi; he has sent forth the seven rivers, and has opened the shut-up sources (of the streams).
RV 8.24.27
य ऋक्षादूंहसो ुर्चर्द्ो वायामप्तत्स णसुन्धषु । वधदामसस्य तुणवनृम्ि नीनर्ः ॥२७॥

[Dwelleres on the seven rivers: sapta sindhuṣu, i.e. the dwellers on the banks of the seven rivers; or, on the shores of the seven seas].
RV. 1.35.8 refers to “Eight summits of the Earth, three shore or desert regions, seven rivers” :

Source: Meluhha copper, tin seafaring merchants on Shu-ilishu cylinder seal are from Saptasindhavah 'seven rivers' region https://tinyurl.com/y63mbzko R̥ gveda documents a battle between the Puru Vedic Aryan kingdoms of the Bharatas, allied with other peoples of the north west India, guided by the royal sage Viśvāmitra, and the Trtsu-Bharata (Puru) king Sudas, who emerges victorious. KF Geldner in his 1951 translation avers that this battle narrative is a historical event. Schmidt has, in 1980, discussed the details of the battle. (Schmidt, H.P. Notes on Rgveda 7.18.5-10. Indica. Organ of the Heras Institute, Bombay. Vol.17, 1980, 41-47.)
Reasons/causes for the dāśarājñá, battle of ten kings
What was the objective of the battle? In my view, the battlefield in the Ravi riverbasin and the key cause for the battle is provided by the metaphor of 'hungry fish' used in RV7.18.6:
पुरोळा इुत्तवमशो युक्षरासीद्राये र्त्स्यासो णनणशता अपीव । ुश्रणूंष्ट चु क्रभृमगवो द्र ुह्य वश्च सखा सखायर्तरणिषूचोः ॥६॥ RV 7.18.6
"Eager for spoil was Turvasa Purodas, fain to win wealth, like fishes urged by hunger. The Bhrgus and the Druhyus quickly listened: friend rescued friend mid the two distant peoples." (Griffith translation)
Sayana/Wilson translate the ̥rca focussing on Turvaśa's mission to acquire wealth: Turvaśa, who was presiding (at solemn rites), diligent in sacrifice, (went to Sudāsa) for wealth; but like fishes restricted (to the element of water), the Bhrigus and Druhyus quickly assailed them; of these two everywhere going the friend (of Sudāsa, Indra) rescued his friend. रयि m. or (rarely) f. (fr. √ रा ; the following forms occur in
the वेद , रणयस् , °य्/इ्र् , °णयणभस् , °यीिा्र् ; र्य्य /आ,°्य्य /ऐ,°्य्य /आ्र् ; cf. 2. रै ) , property , goods , possessions , treasure , wealth (often personified) RV. AV. VS. Br. S3rS. ChUp.
This comparison of Matsya people with 'hungry fish' means, that there were rivalries among the people about the use of water from the rivers for their livelihoods (hence, the signifier of hungry fish) and about the impediments caused to acquire wealth.
The pun on the word matsya, 'fish' is also a reference to the name of peoples called matsya. Matsya is one of the 16 janapadas. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsya_Kingdom This may explain the reason why the battle was joined by ten kings since a large number of people from the region of North India were concerned about their livelihood, searching for avenues to acquire wealth.

Locus of the Battle of Ten Kings The locus of the Battle of Ten Kings was Paruṣṇī river basin. A battle was also fought on the Yamunā river basin with Bheda, Ajas, Śigru and Yakṣu. Thus, the territory of T ̥rtsu extended from Yamunā river to Paruṣṇī river. The reference to the Battleof Ten kings occurs in RV 7.33.3 and 7.83.6-8:
Grikffith 7.33.3 So, verily, with these he crossed the river, in company with these he slaughtered Bheda. So in the fight with the Ten Kings, Vasisthas! did Indra help Sudas through your devotions.
Griffith 7.83.6-8 The men of both the hosts invoked you in the fight, Indra and Varuna, that they might win the wealth, What time ye helped Sudas, with all the Trtsu folk, when the Ten Kings had pressed him down in their attack. Ten Kings who worshipped not, O IndraVaruna-, confederate, in war prevailed not over Sudas. True was the boast of heroes sitting at the feast: so at their invocations Gods were on their side.
O IndraVaruna-, ye gave Sudas your aid when the Ten Kings in battle compassed him about, There where the whiterobed- Trtsus with their braided hair, skilled in song worshipped you with homage and with hymn.
Belligerents involved in dāśarājñá
The Trtsu are the group led by king Sudas. Sudas himself is included in the "ten kings", as the Trtsus are said to be surrounded by ten kings in 7.5.3. But it is not made explicit how this number is supposed to be broken down: if of the peoples mentioned in 7.18, the Turvasas, Yaksus (pun for Yadu), Matsyas, Bhrgus, Druhyus, Pakthas, Bhalanas, Alinas, Shivas and Visanins are counted, the full number is reached, leaving the Anavas (7.18.14), the Ajas and Sigrus (7.18.19) and the "21 men of both Vaikarna tribes" (7.18.11) without a king, and implying that Bheda (7.18.19, also mentioned 7.33.3 and 7.83.4, the main leader slain by Sudas), Simyu (7.18.5), and Kavasa (7.18.12) are the names of individual kings. The Bharatas are named among the enemies in 7.33 but not in 7.18.
• Alinas: One of the tribes defeated by Sudas at the Dasarajna, and it was suggested that they lived to the north-east of Nuristan, because the land was mentioned by the Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang. • Anu: Some place them in the Paruṣṇī (Ravi) area. • Bhrigus: Probably the priestly family descended from the ancient Kavi Bhrigu. Later, they are related to the composition of parts of the Atharva Veda (BhṛgvĀṅgirasa) . • Bhalanas: Fought against Sudas in the Dasarajna battle. Some scholars have argued that the Bhalanas lived in the Bolan Pass area. • Druhyus: Some align them with the Gandhari (RV I 1.126.7). • Matsya are only mentioned in the RV (7.18.6), but later in connection with the Śālva. • Parsu: The Parśu have been connected by some with the ancient Persians. • Purus: One of the major tribal confederations in the Rigveda. • Panis: Also the name of a class of demons; later associated with the Scythians.

Yamunā river is mentioned in RV 7.18.19). The dāśarājña battle (the Battle of the Ten Kings) is described (in RV 7.18, and also 19,33 and 83). In this battle, Sudās, fights from the east on the banks of the third easternmost river of the Punjab, the Paruṣṇī.
Sudas’ fight is with the coalition of ten Anu tribes who are described (in RV 7.5.3) as the Asiknī people (as they are fighting from the west, from the direction of the fourth easternmost river of the Punjab, the Asiknī.

RV 7.18 describes the Battle of Ten Kings
Griffith RV 7.18: 1. ALL is with thee, O Indra, all the treasures which erst our fathers won who sang thy praises. With thee are milchkine- good to milk, and horses: best winner thou of riches for the pious. 2 For like a King among his wives thou dwellest: with glories, as a Sage, surround and help us. Make us, thy servants, strong for wealth, and honour our songs wirth kine and steeds and decoration. 3 Here these our holy hymns with joy and gladness in pious emulation have approached thee. Hitherward come thy path that leads to riches: may we find shelter in thy favour, Indra. 4 Vasistha hath poured forth his prayers, desiring to milk thee like a cow in goodly pasture. All these my people call thee Lord of cattle: may Indra. come unto the prayer we offer. 5 What though the floods spread widely, Indra made them shallow and easy for Sudas to traverse. He, worthy of our praises, caused the Simyu, foe of our hymn, to curse the rivers' fury. 6 Eager for spoil was Turvasa Purodas, fain to win wealth, like fishes urged by hunger. The Bhrgus and the Druhyus quickly listened: friend rescued friend mid the two distant peoples. 7 Together came the Pakthas, the Bhalanas, the Alinas, the Sivas, the Visanins. Yet to the Trtsus came the Aryas' Comrade, through love of spoil and heroes' war, to lead them. 8 Fools, in their folly fain to waste her waters, they parted inexhaustible Parusni. Lord of the Earth, he with his might repressed them: still lay the herd and the affrighted



16
herdsman. 9 As to their goal they sped to their destruetion: they sought Parusni; even the swift returned not. Indra abandoned, to Sudas the manly, the swiftly flying foes, unmanly babblers. 10 They went like kine unherded from the pasture, each clinging to a friend as chance directed. They who drive spotted steeds, sent down by Prsni, gave ear, the Warriors and the harnessed horses. 11 The King who scattered oneandtwenty— people of both Vaikarna tribes through lust of gloryAs the skilled priest clips grass within the chamber, so hath the Hero Indra, wrought their downfall. 12 Thou, thunderarmed-, overwhelmedst in the waters famed ancient Kavasa and then the Druhyu. Others here claiming friendship to their friendship, devoted unto thee, in thee were joyful. 13 Indra at once with conquering might demolished all their strong places and their seven castles. The goods of Anus' son he gave to Trtsu. May we in sacrifice conquer scorned Puru. 14 The Anavas and Druhyus, seeking booty, have slept, the sixty hundred, yea, six thousand, And sixandsixty— heroes. For the pious were all these mighty exploits done by Indra. 15 These Trtsus under Indras' careful guidance came speeding like loosed waters rushing downward. The foemen, measuring exceeding closely, abandoned to Sudas all their provisions. 16 The heros' side who drank the dressed oblation, Indras' denier, far over earth he scattered. Indra brought down the fierce destroyers' fury. He gave them various roads, the paths' Controller. 17 even with the weak he wrought this matchless exploit: even with a goat he did to death a lion. He pared the pillars' angles with a needle. Thus to Sudas Indra gave all provisions. 18 To thee have all thine enemies submitted: even the fierce Bheda hast thou made thy subject. Cast down thy sharpened thunderbolt, O Indra, on him who harms the men who sing thy praises. 19 Yamuna and the Trtsus aided Indra. There he stripped Bheda bare of all his treasures. The Ajas and the Sigrus and the Yaksus brought in to him as tribute heads of horses. 20 Not to be scorned, but like Dawns past and recent, O Indra, are thy favours and thy riches. Devaka, Manyamanas' son, thou slewest, and smotest Sambara from the lofty mountain. 21 They who, from home, have gladdened thee, thy servants Parasara, Vasistha, Satayatu, Will not forget thy friendship, liberal Giver. So shall the days dawn prosperous for the princes. 22 Priestlike-, with praise, I move around the altar, earning Paijavanas' reward, O Agni, Two hundred cows from Devavans' descendant, two chariots from Sudas with mares to draw them. 23 Gift of Paijavana, four horses bear me in foremost place, trained steeds with pearl to deck them.



17
Sudass' brown steeds, firmlystepping-, carry me and my son for progeny and glory. 24 Him whose fame spreads between wide earth and heaven, who, as dispenser, gives each chief his portion, Seven flowing Rivers glorify like Indra. He slew Yudhyamadhi in close encounter. 25 Attend on him O ye heroic Maruts as on Sudas' father Divodasa. Further Paijavanas' desire with favour. Guard faithfully his lasting firm dominion.

Kārpāsa (कापामस) is a Sanskrit word referring to “Levantine cotton tree”, a species of cotton from the Malvaceae (mallows) family of flowering plants, and is used throughout Ayurvedic literature such as the Caraka-saṃhitā. It is also known as Karpāsa or Kārpāsī. The word Kārpāsa as an adjective literally translates to “made of cotton, cottony”. The official botanical name is Gossypium herbaceum and is commonly known in English as “Indian cotton” or “common cotton” among others.

Part 3 - Incineration of tin parent: Chapter VI - Metals (6): Vanga (tin)
Next >
First process.
First process.
Leaves of tin are to be smeared with haritala and milk of aria and then subjected to Laghuputa with the ashes of bodhi (called ‘bauri’ in Bengal) and chincha (tamarind).
Second process.
Melt some purified banga in an earthen pot placed over fire, and put upon it one sixteenth its weight of mercury. Then put a little purified haritala, every now and then, upon the compound which is to be frequently rubbed by means of a stick made of vanya karpasa wood, till the compound is reduced to ashes.
Third process.
Leaves of vanga are reduced to ashes, if they are subjected to puta after having been smeared with haritala rubbed with the juice of palasha.
Fourth process.
Vanga is reduced to ashes, if it is heated by fire made of chincha, palasha, and pippala wood, after having been mixed with oil or essence of bhallataka and wrapped with a piece of cloth.
Fifth process.
Vanga is incinerated, if subjected to puta for seven times after having been mixed with haritala and rubbed with milk of arka plant, dry barks of asvatha tree being placed on all sides of the vanga, while confined within the samputa.
Sixth process.



19
Purified leaves of vanga are to be melted in an earthen vessel, placed over fire, and an equal quantity of ashes of apamarga is to be mixed with the melted vanga. The whole thing is to be rubbed quickly by means of the chick end of an iron rod, till the whole thing turns into ashes, which are next to be freed from powdered charcoal, and again subjected to a very strong heat by puta. This results in the incineration of the vanga.
Seventh process.
Vanga is to be placed over fire in an earthen pot. When it melts, the following powders are to be placed upon it, the whole thing being turned constantly by means of an iron ladle:—turmeric, jamani, jira, chincha bark, and asvatha bark—all of these finely powdered. The whole thing is thus reduced to ashes. The ashes of the powders are then to be washed off by means of water, leaving the white powders of vanga deposited at the bottom.
Eighth process.
Vanga is incinerated, if it is subjected to heat by puta after having been smeared with a paste made of makshika, and haritala, duly rubbed with the juice of palasha leaves.
Ninth process.
Both vanga and sisaka(lead) may be purified in the same way, and both may be incinerated in the following way:—Ashes of asvatha and chincha and an equal quantity of haritala are to be rubbed with a sour-non-metallic juice or with the juice or decoction of palasha leaves. Vanga or sisaka is to be smeared with this paste and heated by puta. When cooled, the whole thing is to be taken out of the puta, rubbed again with one tenth its weight of haritala and the liquid referred to above, and then subjected to heat by puta, Twenty such putas are to reduce the vanga (or sisaka) into ashes.
Tenth process.
Leaves of vanga are to be smeared with one fourth their weight of mercury, and then with a paste made of bark of shirisha, turmeric, and juice of kanya. They are then to be put inside a paste made of rice and tamarind seeds, and then heated by puta. Twenty such putas result in the incineration of the vanga.
Eleventh process.
Tin melted in an earthen pot, kept over fire, is to be rubbed, by means of an iron ladle with salt petre, gradually put upon it, till fire comes out of it and burns the whole thing. Upon the fire being put out and the pot with its contents being cooled of itself, the ashes of tin are to be freed from those of saltpetre by means of water. The ashes, thus prepared, with an equal quantity of haritala, are to be rubbed with a sour vegetable juice, and subjected to heat by Gaja-puta. The product with one tenth its weight of haritala is again to be rubbed with a sour vegetable juice, and again subjected to heat by puta. Ten such acts of puta will kill the tin out-right.
Twelfth process.



20
Vanga is incinerated, if it is subjected to heat by puta, after having been smeared with a paste made of svarna-makshika, haritala, and juice of palasha.
Thirteenth process.
Leaves of vanga are incinerated by means of haritala, rock-salt, camphor, shells of crab, conch, oyster, and cowrie. [This may be effected in one of these two ways:—(1) Molten vanga may be roasted with the powder of the things specified, the ashes of which may be washed away afterwards, or (2) Leaves of vanga may be heated by puta after having been smeared with a paste of the things specified.]
Fourteenth process.
Vanga is incinerated, if it is heated by Gaja puta for forty times, after having been smeared each time with a paste made of bibhitaki and decoction of bhallataka and covered on all sides by means of sesamum cakes.
