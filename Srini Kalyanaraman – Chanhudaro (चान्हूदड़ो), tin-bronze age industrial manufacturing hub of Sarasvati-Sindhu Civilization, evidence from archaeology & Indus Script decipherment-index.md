Chanhudaro (चाून्हदड़ो ), tin-bronze age industrial
manufacturing hub of Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization, evidence from archaeology & Indus Script decipherment
This monograph integrates four streams of knowledge systems:
1. metallurgy of tin-bronze revolution,
2. guild-organization to manage a manufacturing hub,
3. writing system which documents wealth-accounting ledgers of manufacturing activities of Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization;
4. matching the documentation with archaeologically attested artifacts.
The evidence is presented from Chanhu-daro which is titled 'Sheffield of Ancient India'. Sheffield is a 20th century metaphor for an industrial, metals manufacturing hub of the Industrial Revolution. The monograph demonstrates that Chanhu-daro is a manufacturing hub of the TinBronze Revolution of 4th millennium BCE.
The monograph is organized in the following sections:
Section A. Importance of Chanhudaro as Sheffield of Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization
Section B. Gallery of select Indus Script inscriptions from Chanhudaro
Section C. Decipherment of Chanhudaro seal c77 kol पाथरवट Smelter, stone-mould maker
Section D. Chanhudaro seal of a trampling, in-heat bull & a supine long-legged person signify Meluhha rebus expression kammaṭa ḍhangar 'mint blacksmith'
Introduction

The details of new material include 70 inscriptions from Chanhudaro. The objective of this monograph is to decipher these inscriptions in archaeo-metallurgical, archaeological contexts and traditions of Ancient India of guild organiations to manage industrial scale activities.
Chanhudaro (चान्हूदड़ो ) is an archaeological site of post-urban Jhukar phase of Sarasvati-Sindhu Valley Civilization in Nawabshah District (now called Benazirabad) Sindh province, Pakistan. Chanhudaro is about 12 miles east of present-day Sindhu River-bed.
"For building houses, baked bricks were used extensively at Chanhu-daro and Mohenjodaro. Several constructions were identified as workshops or industrial quarters and some of the buildings of Chanhudaro might have been warehouses...An Impressive workshop, recognised as Bead Making Factory, was found at Chanhudaro, which included a furnace. Shell bangles, beads of many materials, stealite seals and metal works were manufactured at Chanhudaro..." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanhudaro
I submit a Meluhha reading of this unique hypertext on eleven inscriptions: slant: ḍhālako 'ingot' PLUS two: dula 'two' rebus: dul 'metal casting'; thus, dul ḍhālako 'metal castings, ingots'.
I submit that Chanhudaro is the most significant site of the civilization since it bridges two great river valleys of ancient times: Sindhu river valley and Sarasvati River valley.
The site of Chanhudaro is located on the left bank of Sindhu River and right-bank of Sarasvati River.
The site thus constitutes a pattana, a transhipment market for maritime cargo from the two great Himalayan rivers which are waterways which linked Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization trade activities with the Ancient Near East, through the navigable Rann of Kutch and Persian Gulf and TigrisEuphrates doab of Mesopotamia and Mediterranean Sea, of an Ancient Maritime Tin Route which linked Hanoi (Vietnam) and Haifa (Israel).
I submit that चान्हूदड़ो , the place name, in ancient Indian tradition, signifies sāu dã̄ ḍū
'merchant ridge'.
The word चान्हू is cognate with sāu 'merchant' : *sahu ʻ strong ʼ. [Cf. sahúri -- RV. -

"Indus Script, ||/ sign is seen only on inscriptions found at Chanhudaro. It occurred on eleven objects, (around one sixth of all inscribed objectes recovered from Chanhudaro) leading to suggestion by Asko Parpola that it may represent town's name...Cotton cloth traces preserved on silver or bronze objects were known from Chanhudaro, Harappa and Rakhigarhi. Objects of Iron were reported from Chanhudaro, Ahar, Rajasthan (India) and Mundigak and this gains importance as it has been claimed that Iron was produced in 3rd Millennium in South Asia Region...Among the seals so found out on one seal, there is a figure of chief deity with buffalo head, on its both sides, are two other man deities and behind each of them is a serpent in standing posture (See Illustration - Seal A). On another seal, there is a serpent, in standing posture, behind the bull, which is fighting with a mighty man (See Illustration - Seal B). On another third seal,

there is a serpent resting his head on a Wooden bench or seat, which is protecting a tree deity (See Illustration - Seal C)."

Comparable to Figure B which shows a spear-thrower, a narrative on a Chanhudaro artifact shows a male spear thrower or dancer - a broken statue (4.1 cm) is of much importance, found at Chanhudaro, is now displayed at Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, USA.

Jonathan Mark Kenoyer writes of this stunning figurine: "We also see the bun hairstyle on the miniature bronze sculpture of a male spear-thrower or dancer. Traces of eyes and nose are present. The hair is arranged in a bun on the back of the head, with a turban or long hair wrapped around the head. The twisting posture and upraised arm suggest a spear held in the right arm."

The spearman is a person of importance. He throws a spear: kundi 'spear' rebus:
kuṇḍī = chief of village. kuṇḍi-a = village headman; leader of a village. Thus, spear-thrower signifies kuṇḍi-a 'village headman; leader of a village'. On one narrative, he places his foot on the head of the buffalo. kolsa = to kick the foot forward, the foot to come into contact with anything when walking or running; kolsa pasirkedan = I kicked it over (Santali.lex.)mēṛsa = v.a. toss, kick with the foot, hit with the tail (Santali) Rebus: kol ‘furnace, forge’ (Kuwi) kol ‘alloy of five metals, pancaloha’ (Ta.) •kolhe (iron smelter; kolhuyo, jackal) kol, kollan-, kollar = blacksmith (Ta.). Thus, he is a kol, 'smelter' of kuntha munda 'hard iron'. The cobra hood on the field symbol behind the buffalo signifies (s)phaṭa-, sphaṭā- a serpent's expanded hood, Pkt. phaḍā id. rebus: phaḍā, paṭṭaḍa 'metals manufactory'. Thus, the village headman is also the guild-master of the metals manufactory of Chanhudaro.
The buffalo is shown butting to signify: muṭṭikka 'to dash' (Malayalam) मुत्रिका 'wrist, knuckles'
rebus: मुत्रिका muṭṭi 'goldsmith' (Skt. Malayalam). The narrative makes the village headman incharge of the metals manufactory.

Section A. Importance of Chanhudaro as Sheffield of Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization
Map showing the location of Chanhudaro. Courtesy JM Kenoyer.
Ernest John Henry Mackay called Chanhudaro ‘Sheffield of Ancient India’ because copper knives, spears, razors, tools, axes, copper fish hooks, vessels and dishes were found at this archaeological site. It was also a centre for manufacturing carnelian beads. The site is located between Sindhu (left-bank) and Sarasvati River (right-bank). It is located 130 kms. south of Mohenjo-daro in Sind Province. It was inhabited between 4000 BCE to 1700 BCE.

This addendum to:
Trade contacts with Meluhha artisans in Mari for tin-bronze production in Mesopotamia proven by provenance studies and cuneiform texts
http://tinyurl.com/yxhfgnll included the following Abstract from Iranica Antiqua, 2009:
Copper from Gujarat used in Mesopotmia, 3rd millennium BCE, evidenced by lead isotope analyses of tin-bronze objects; report by Begemann F. et al.
Iranica Antiqua Volume: 44 Date: 2009 Pages: 1-45 Title: Über das frühe Kupfer Mesopotamiens
1. Geographical locations of sites of Mesopotamia from which artifacts were analyzed in this work (After Fig. 1 in Begemann, F. et al, 2009 loc.cit.) The conclusion
is: "Unsere bleiisotopische evidenz legt nahe, das in Mesopotamien fur legierung mit zinn verwendete kupfer urudu-luh-ha stamme aus Indien, was ebenfalls vertraglich ist mit einem import via dilmun." (Trans. Our lead isotope evidence suggests that the urudu-luh-ha copper used in Mesopotamia for tin alloying is from India, which is also contracted with an import via Dilmun.)" (opcit., p.28)
2. A lead isotope study »On the Early copper of Mesopotamia« reports on copper-base artefacts ranging in age from the 4th millennium BC (Uruk period) to the Akkadian at the end of the 3rd millennium BC. Arguments are presented that, in the (tin)bronzes, the lead associated with the tin used for alloying did not contribute to the total in any detectable way. Hence, the lead isotopy traces the copper and cannot address the problem of the provenance of tin. The data suggest as possible source region of the copper a variety of ore occurrences in Anatolia, Iran, Oman, Palestine and, rather unexpectedly (by us), from India. During the earliest period the isotopic signature of ores from Central and North Anatolia is dominant; during the next



12
millennium this region loses its importance and is hardly present any more at all. Instead, southeast Anatolia, central Iran, Oman, Feinan-Timna in the rift valley between Dead Sea and Red Sea, and sources in the Caucasus are now potential suppliers of the copper. Generally, an unambiguous assignment of an artefact to any of the ores is not possible because the isotopic fingerprints of ore occurrences are not unique. In our suite of samples bronze objects become important during ED III (middle of the 3rd millennium BC) but they never make up more than 50 % of the total. They are distinguished in their lead isotopy by very high 206Pb-normalized abundance ratios. As source of such copper we suggest Gujarat/Southern Rajasthan which, on general grounds, has been proposed before to have been the most important supplier of copper in Ancient India. We propose this Indian copper to have been arsenic-poor and to be the uruduluh-ha variety which is one of the two sorts of purified copper mentioned in contemporaneous written texts from Mesopotamia to have been in circulation there concurrently.

-- The Chanhudaro seal narrative is Indus Script hypertext, rebus kammaṭa ḍhangar 'mint blacksmith'
Chanhu Daro depicting a bull in heat, trampling with hoofs, trampling over a prostrate person with long legs.
Archaeologist Allchin interprets the scene as Father Sky/Heaven (Dyaus Pitr) represented by the bull copulating with Mother Earth (Prthvi Matr)represented by the woman.
Avoiding speculations of this type, the orthographic styles of hieroglyphs on the Chanhudaro Indus Script Inscription are re-interpreted in the context of the decipherment of the Text message of the inscription rendered with signs/hypertexts which have been read rebus

The Chanhu-daro Seal: Gaur Ravaging a Female
Gregory Possehl, whose drawing is shown of seal, writes "Mackay found an extraordinary seal in his excavations at Chanhu-daro. It shows a short-horned bull, Bos gaurus, above a prostrate human figure. He thought that the scene depicted an attack by the bull, and the human on the ground was attempting a defense against the trampling animal. In an essay on the seal, F.R. Allchin explains that the gaur is standing on its hind legs, slightly elevated above a human figure; its front legs are shown in excited motion. The bull's erect penis is shown in correct anatomical position. The figure below the gaur is less clearly shown and consequently more difficult to interpret. Allchin and Mackay see a headdress to the far right bottom of the seal impression.
Seen from Allchin's perspective, the scene is very dynamic and excited; the bull is about to take a female goddess in an act that might be seen as sexual violence, and yet the clear appearrance of



19
her open, exposed genitals tells that she is a willing partner in the deed."
Later, Possehl quotes Mackay's reading of the seal: "We are led to wonder whether the omnipresent 'bull,' whether unicorn, bison or zebu, may not be the symbolic representation of the Heaven Father, and just as the deity with the plant sprout emerging from head or genitals may not be Mother Earth."
https://www.harappa.com/blog/chanhu-daro-seal-gaur-ravaging-female
It is seen from an enlargement of the bottom portion of the seal impression that the ‘prostrate person’ may not be a person but a ligature of the neck of an antelope with rings on its necks or of a post with ring-stones. The head of the ‘person’ is not shown. So, I would surmise that this is an artist's representation of an act of copulation (by an animal) + a ligatured neck of another bovine or alternatively, a pillar with ring-stones ligatured to the bottom portion of a body. It is not uncommon in the artistic tradition to ligature bodies to the rump of, for example, a bull's posterior ligatured to a horned woman

Chanhudaro seal orthographically signifies both semantics: 1. bull kept for covering; and 2. leading ox in treading out grain on a threshing floor. Thus,both actions of covering and trampling under hoofs or legs are signified.
The protrate person is a long-legged person. This orthographic style is intended to signify the rebur reading: dhanga = 'tall, long shanked' rebus: dhangar 'blacksmith'
ḍhanga = tall, long shanked; maran: ḍhangi aimai kanae = she is a big tall woman (Santali) S. ḍhaṅgaru m. ʻlean emaciated beastʼ; L. (Shahpur) ḍhag̠ g̠ ā ʻ small weak ox ʼ(CDIAL 5324)

Semantics of trampling is conveyed by the root word: kaṇḍá. A cognate homonym conveys the semantics of 'copulation'. khamḍa, kamda

The narrative of 'copulation' (bison in heat) atop the long-legged person:
khamḍa, kamda 'copulation' (Santali) signifies Rebus: kampaṭṭa 'mint, coiner'; kammaṭi a coiner (Kannada). Thus, the narrative signifies mint (of) blacksmith:kammaṭa ḍhangar.

poladu పోలడు 'black drongo' rebus: poladu 'steel' पोलाद pōlāda n ( or P) Steel. प़ोलादी a Of steel.

The name булат is a Russian transliteration of the Persian word fulad, meaning steel. This type of steel was used by the armies of nomadic peoples. Bulat steel was the main type of steel used for swords in the armies of Genghis Khan, the great emperor of the Mongolian Empire. The technique used in making wootz steel has been lost for centuries and the bulat steel used today makes use of a more recently developed technique...Carbon steel consists of two components: pure iron, in the form of ferrite, and cementite or iron carbide, a compound of iron and carbon. Cementite is very hard and brittle; its hardness is about 640 by the Brinell hardness test, whereas ferrite is only 200. The amount of the carbon and the cooling regimen determine the crystalline and chemical composition of the final steel. In bulat, the slow cooling process allowed the cementite to precipitate as micro particles in between ferrite crystals and arrange in random patterns. The color of the carbide is dark while steel is grey. This mixture is what leads to the famous patterning of Damascus steel.Cementite is essentially a ceramic, which accounts for the sharpness of the Damascus (and bulat) steel. "
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulat_steel "In the Muslim world of the 9th-12th centuries CE, the production of fuladh, a Persian word, has been described by Al-Kindi, Al-Biruni and Al-Tarsusi, from narm-ahanand shaburqan, two other Persian words representing iron products obtained by direct reduction of the ore. Ahan means iron. Narm-ahan is a soft iron and shaburqan a harder one or able to be quench-hardened. Old nails and horse-shoes were also used as base for fuladh preparation. It must be noticed that, according to Hammer- Purgstall, there was no Arab word for steel, which explain the use of Persian words. Fuladh prepared by melting in small crucibles can be considered as a steel in our modem classification, due to its properties (hardness, quench hardened ability, etc.). The word fuladh means "the purified" as explained by Al-Kindi. This word can be found as puladh, for instance in Chardin (1711 AD) who called this product; poulad

... ‘...’pulad’ of Central Asia. The oasis of Merv where crucible steel was also made by the medieval period lies in this region. The term ‘pulad’ appears in Avesta, the holy book of
Zoroastrianism and in a Manicheen text of Chinese Turkestan. There are many variations of this term ranging from the Persian ‘polad’, the Mongolian ‘bolat’ and ‘tchechene’, the Russian ‘bulat’, the Ukrainian and Armenian ‘potovat’, Turkish and Arab ‘fulad’, ‘farlad’ in Urdu and ‘phaulad’ in Hindi. It is this bewildering variety of descriptions that was used in the past that makes a study of this subject so challenging.’ (p.30)

This name derives from the Mongolian (Qalq-a ayalγu) “Bold”, from the Persian (Tājīk)
"pwlạd", meaning “steel”. Bolad († 1313), was a Mongol minister of the Yuan Dynasty, and later served in the Ilkhanate as the representative of the Great Khan of the Mongol Empire and cultural adviser to the Ilkhans. Geographical spread:
