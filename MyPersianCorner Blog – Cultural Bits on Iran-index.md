Sefid ya Siyah? White or Black?
mypersiancorner.com/2013/12/sefid-ya-siyah-white-or-black.html
Salaam bacheha!
I was flipping through some old photos of Iran the other day when I came across some photos of food, and it got me thinking about ordering in restaurants- specifically, ordering soft drinks.
In the U.S. (as in most places) you order a Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite, etc. In other words, you order them by name. In Iran, however, you order by color: سیاه siyah black, سفید sefid white, and زرد zard yellow. Black is Coke/Pepsi, white is Sprite/7-Up, and yellow is Fanta. Pretty logical.
I remember anytime we went to a restaurant, my uncle would take drink orders. We'd all order by color, and then he'd review, "So that was 4 black, 3 yellow, and 1 white drink?" Or else he would simply ask, "Chand ta siyah? Chand ta sefid? How many black? How many white?" And we'd answer. I was in a fast food place in Tehran once when the guy in front of me ordered a nooshaabeh, drink, but he didn't specify which. Instead of asking what kind, the owner asked che rang?, what color?
I also saw a great example of this over the weekend when I watched the movie Pole Choobi, The Wooden Bridge. The friends are sitting down to eat, and as he's opening the bottles, Bahram Radan's character, Amir, asks, "Bacheha ki che rangi mikhoreh?, Guys, who's drinking what color?"
This is not to say that you can't order by name. Of course you can order a Coke, and many do. But خواهی نشوی رسوا همرنگ جماعت شو
khaahi nashavi rosvaa, hamrange jama'at sho, if you don't want to be disgraced, do as others do ( literally, become the same color as the crowd).
or, when in Rome (or Tehran), do as the Romans (or Tehranis.)

The Zoroastrian Neighborhood of Yazd
mypersiancorner.com/2014/02/the-zoroastrian-neighborhood-of-yazd.html
Yazd is known as the city of Zartoshti, Zoroastrians, in Iran, and the first place I visited was the Zoroastrian neighborhood. It was incredibly helpful to have a Zoroastrian tour guide who was able to explain some of the wonderful features and traditions of this neighborhood, both of which really seemed to establish a sense of a close-knit community.
Before explaining anything, my guide loved quizzing me to see how clever I was (and both he and I were frequently disappointed.) My first quiz was this: Judging by the door, how do I know if the residents are Muslim or Zoroastrian? Well, surely there was some kind of a sign, but after looking and looking, I just couldn't find it.
One of the very first posts that I wrote was about the "his and hers" doorknockers in Iran. The sound each one makes tells you whether a man or a woman is at the door, something that is important for Muslims to know. Houses with Zoroastrian residents, on the other hand, have only one knocker on the door because they welcome anyone. So the door above is actually a "Muslim" door, but one of the handles has been stolen- something I noticed that was quite common in this neighborhood- because the iron fetches quite a bit of money.

Zoroastrian doors
Another feature of the Zoroastrian neighborhood is the high walls and benches outside the doors. The benches are for sitting in the evenings and chatting/spending time with your neighbors.
A morning ritual is to spray water in front of your door signal to your neighbors that everything is fine at your house. Should someone not do this, it's a sign that something is wrong, maybe the person is sick (or worse), etc. Don't you love the sense of community already?

6/10



Quiz number 2: Is this a Zoroastrian house or a Muslim house, and how do you know?
Well, since we were in the Zoroastrian neighborhood, I knew it had to be Zoroastrian, but I didn't know why. The give away was the sarv, cypress trees, which play an important role in Zoroastrian traditions and wedding ceremonies.
Along the way were also many short doors and what seemed to be holes in the walls. The doors led directly to the bāgh, garden, stable, or basement where wood is stored. The holes in the wall held oil with a little string to ignite a flame (which is why they are blackened) and light up the alley.

9/10



According to the guide, Muslims are allowed in all Zoroastrian places except for one: guest houses/hotels. This is because they don't go by the Islamic dress code there and men and women are together.
A stop in this neighborhood doesn't seem to be very popular on the Yazd tour. My cousin only passed through here on her way to the Ātashkadeh the first time she visited. But both she and I were so glad to have gotten an explanation. I loved the sense of community that was evident in the design and traditions of this neighborhood. But I'm dedicating a post to the one feature that I loved the most... stay tuned!

Elephant Thoughts and Elephant Farts
mypersiancorner.com/2013/07/elephant-thoughts-and-elephant-farts.html
When I was teaching Persian, my students, like most students, always wanted to learn the bad things first. I don't remember how we got on the subject, but one day, one of my half Iranian students was explaining the difference between gooz, fart and chos, sbd fart. That's when I mentioned chos-e-fil. Having already learned the animals, they put two and two together and assumed chos-e-fil meant elephant fart. But they were in for a surprise. I finally dropped the bomb on them that chos-e-fil is actually the Persian word for (wait for it)... popcorn. I was met with a class of horrified faces. Why on earth would you crazy Iranians call "popcorn" elephant fart? Unfortunately I had (and still have) no answer. It's just one of those things that makes Persian so colorful. At the end of the semester, I was left with this beautiful drawing from my students in honor of their favorite word they learned all semester.
Aside from popcorn, the elephant plays a role in a few Persian proverbs and idioms, too. Take the following:
1. فیلش یاد هندوستان کرده / feelesh yade hendustan kardeh/ His elephant is thinking of/remembers India.
You see, elephants have been to India, so when someone's elephant remembers India, it means that they are nostalgic for a particular place or event. My dad is from Taleghan, an area about 2 hours north of Tehran that is comprised of about 90 villages- and I mean villages. It may be the weekend destination of big city folks now, but back in the day there weren't even paved roads. My Tehrani cousins used to call the donkeys "taxi Taleghani". I think that says it all. Many years ago, we were visiting a park in the U.S. when my dad decided to roll up his pants and stand in the river for a bit. My mom was super anxious and upset because the current was fairly strong. After my dad got out of the river, my mom just shook her head saying feelesh yade henustan kardeh, of course implying that he was nostalgic for his hometown, that his elephant remembered Taleghan. 1/2



Rumi has a poem which talks of this very proverb. I wonder whether we got the proverb from the poem or vice versa. Regardless, here is the beginning:
There must exist an elephant, so that when it sleeps by night, it can dream about Hindustan. After all, the ass can't dream about Hindustan because the ass has never been there (or never left)-so there's need of a spirit with the power of an elephant able to journey in sleep to Hindustan. Desire makes the elephant remember Hindustannostalgia by night gives his recollection form; ...
engar az damaghe feel oftade /انگار از دماغ فیل افتاده.2 Literally this means it's as if she has fallen out of the elephant's trunk. Someone who thinks highly of themselves has fallen from the elephant's trunk. The English equivalent would be as proud as a peacock. I don't know what's so special about the elephant's trunk that would make a person proud, but that's the way it is in Persian.
3. To compare two disproportionate things, Persian uses the elephant and the teacup. فیل و فنجان / feel o fenjan. I don't think this one needs explanation.
I'm always interested in proverbs and idioms as I think they are very telling of a culture. But none of these are, perhaps, quite as interesting or as entertaining as the word chos-e-fil. I hope I haven't ruined popcorn for anyone.

The Iranian Death Wish
mypersiancorner.com/2014/03/the-iranian-death-wish.html
*Updated 5/29* Sometimes my mind wanders thinking about random Persian phrases (especially these days as I watch the comedy Shahgoosh which is just an amazing study of the Persian language). The other day I was feeling frustrated and muttered under my breath, khabare margeshun!, the news of their death!, and chuckled upon realizing what I had said. Suddenly all these phrases related to death started piling up in my head like
Jenga: marg!, death!, boro bemir!, go die!, che margeshe?, what's his death? And then the mother phrase of them all came to me: marg bar [Amrika]!, death to [America]! It seems we Iranians have a death wish worse than Charles Bronson.
Now just a word about my people and this last phrase (and yes, this is where my Iranian and American identities conflict). Ask any Iranian, and they will tell you how ugly this phrase is, but don't be offended, Americans. I remember chanting marg bar bādemjun, death to eggplants, when I was little. It's just how we express ourselves linguistically. And when we do use this phrase, it strictly refers to governments, not people (and we use it to refer to our own government just as much as others). Unfortunately, this is where a lot of misunderstanding happens. The way I see it, Iranians don't view governments as representative of the people, so it's very clear to us that when we say death to America (or any place else), we are solely talking about the government. I think Americans, on the other hand, tend to view governments as representatives of the people and therefore equate the two. So when they hear this, they think it's about them. Trust me, it's not. Oddly enough, the U.S. could be the one country above all others that Iranians love the most. How many Americans would say the same about Iran?
But back to more important language matters. These death-related phrases may sound strange in other languages, but they just fit with Persian. You'd think that being the poetic creatures that we are, we'd find a more lyrical way of expressing ourselves, but I guess death is, after all, the ultimate sacrifice. One minute we are
willing to die for you: ghorbunet beram, fadāt besham, elāhi bemiram barāt!; but get on our bad side, and we will just as soon wish for your death.
Marg! Death! This is similar to the expressions khafe sho!, literally choke!, or zahre mār, shut the hell up! Your tone makes a BIG difference in if you mean this or are saying it in a joking manner because it can go both ways.
Khabare margesh!, the news of his death! You'll usually use this referring to someone you don't like. Take a politician you don't care for who made a stupid remark. "Every day s/he makes an idiotic comment! Khabare margesh!" You could, however, use it with someone you like, but who is annoying you. In this clip from the comedy Shahgoosh, Officer Sorkhi is annoyed with his subordinate's dillydallying and says, "Weren't you supposed to return the car, khabare marget!?" Again, tone has a lot to do with it.
Morde shuresho bebaran/morde shur borde, may they take his washed, dead body. In Islam, when someone dies, the body is taken to a mordeshur khune, a place where the body is washed. So you can imagine that when you hear this phrase, the person is so fed up that they are wishing for someone's death, kind of like khabare margesh above.
Boro bemir!, go die! This means something along the lines of shut up! or get out of here! It's a little like boro bābā, but stronger. In this clip, also from Shahgoosh, Officer Sorkhi is telling his friend that he needs to lose weight. Offended, Officer Khofte turns to him and says, boro bemir kachal!, go die baldy! Again, tone makes a big difference in how this is conveyed. (Conversely, you could also say namiri, don't die, sarcastically to mean don't strain yourself when someone is half-assing something.)
1/2



Che margeshe?, what's his death? This would be like what the hell is his problem!? You can use it for objects too. Like if your car won't start, you could say in māshin che margeshe?, what the hell is wrong with this car? It's pretty strong if you say it to a person, though- stronger than English.
Marge man, my death, is used the same way as jāne/joone man in swearing that you are telling the truth. Yes, you can swear both on your life and death.
Khodā margam bede!, oh God, give me death! used when you hear absolutely shocking news or you have done something that you are completely ashamed/embarrassed about.
There is also man bemiram, if I die. You may hear this during exchanges of taarof over who is going to pay. "Man bemiram, I won't let you pay!"
The theme of death can be found in the origin of khāk to saret, dirt on your head, which comes from pouring dirt of someone's head at a funeral. I've also written about goore bābāsh, but you could also say kodum
gooriye/goori hasti?, literally which grave is s/he?/are you?, which is like where the hell is he/are you? When you are searching for someone and can't find them, you think they are dead, so you say this. It's not a nice phrase to use, but it is used when you are angry. In yet another clip from Shahgoosh (and I can't stress just how linguistically clever this show is) Officer Sorkhi can't find his subordinate, Āb Parvar, and over the speaker declares "Āb Parvar, khāk bar sar (a play on words as this phrase sounds similar to and has the same number of syllables as the soldier's name), kodum goori hasti?, literally, Āb Parvar, dirt on your head, which grave are you!? or Āb Parvar, you idiot, where the hell are you!?
Why so many phrases related to death? Well, let's just say we are passionate people (with a flair for drama).

Gestures and Body Language in Iran
mypersiancorner.com/2014/02/gestures-and-body-language-in-iran.html
*Updated* I'm really excited about today's post because it's something that I've been working on for a while now. Learning a language also means learning non-verbal communication. So, for the past few months, I've been sifting through all kinds of Iranian movies and TV series trying to find visuals to go with some of these common gestures/body language. But first, some general Dos and Don'ts.
The Dos:
1. Stand up when someone enters the room (especially if they are older). It's a sign of respect.
2. When meeting someone of the same gender, it's common to shake hands and do ruboosi, kiss each other once on each cheek (although these days most people go in for a third kiss- I never know if it's 2 or 3- just go with it). Remember that you aren't actually kissing the person- more like kissing the air next to their cheek and making a kissing noise. Men and women don't do this in public unless they are related or there is a significant age difference. At home, anything goes.
The Don'ts:
1. Don't give the thumbs up. It's the equivalent of the middle finger in the U.S. Many Iranians (especially in bigger cities) know what this means in the U.S. and will probably give you the benefit of the doubt if you do it by accident (especially if you are a foreigner). My cousin used to give the thumbs up to her friends in class before an exam, but she would write movafagh bāshi, good luck, to avoid confusion. But just stay on the safe side and don't do it.
2. Don't show your back to someone. Or if your must, apologize by saying bebakhshid poshtam be shomāst.
Common Gestures:
1. Raising your eyebrows- this means no. You'll find Iranians do this often instead of actually saying no. It's frequently accompanied by a "nooch" sound made by sort of sucking your tongue. I never knew this wasn't a universally understood gesture until I spent a few too many weeks in Iran and came back doing this to my American friends, none of whom could understand why I wouldn't answer a simple yes or no question.

2. Biting your lower lip with your upper teeth. This expresses disbelief/shame that someone did something. It's often accompanied by hitting one hand with the other and keeping it there, or bringing your fist to your mouth.

3. Pointing with your hand to a seat (or to anything else) while you say befarmāid. Just a polite way to indicate please/after you.
2/8



Shahgoosh
Amin Hayayi in Shame Aroosi
4. Placing your hand over your heart (and slightly bowing your head down/looking down) expresses sincerity.
5. Putting your hand under your chin. This means you are fed up with something (your hand can be higher if you are really fed up!). People will usually say tā injām residam, I've had it up to here while making this gesture.
3/8



Mahnaz Afshar in Atash Bas
6. Putting your index finger on the nose means be quiet. This is just like in the U.S., but instead of saying "shhh", you say "sssss".
The character Lida Mokhtar, the firecracker on Shahgoosh
7. Biting your index finger or the web between your thumb and index finger. This is sort of an anti-jinx, like, God forbid or zabunam lāl.
Elnaz Shakerdoost in To Va Man
4/8



Shahgoosh
Avaye Baran
8. Extending one hand and holding your other hand perpendicular to it. When you make this gesture, you usually say zabun dāre enghadr!, s/he's got a tongue this long meaning the person mouths off a lot .
Khande Dar Baran
9. I previously wrote about the meaning of ru cheshmam. This can also be accompanied by four fingers

covering one eye.
Avaye Baran
Shahgoosh
10. Counting things off. Every culture has a different way of counting on their fingers. Some start with the index finger, some with the thumb, some with the palm open, some closed. In Iran, it's done in two ways: by touching the finger to thumb, starting with the pinky, or by folding each finger down with your other hand, starting with the pinky, shown respectively in the clips from Shahgoosh.
Shahgoosh

Shahgoosh
11. Hitting your own face means oh no!
Avaye Baran
12. Finally, a couple of common gestures used to really emphasize your point. In the first one, the tips of all your fingers and thumb should touch.
Shahgoosh
7/8



Shame Aroosi
The stereotype is that Italians gesture a lot when they speak. I think if you watch any Iranian movies or shows (or have Iranian friends), you'll see that it's also a culture of talking with hands!
So, do you share any of these gestures in your culture too?

My Persian Eyes
mypersiancorner.com/2014/02/my-persian-eyes.html
Before going to Iran, my relatives were calling me every day telling me that they were cheshm entezār, literally eye anticipation. Once I got to Tehran, my Neyshaburi relatives were calling to say that they were cheshm be rāh, literally eyes on the way.
Eyes are quite precious and used in many Persian expressions. They are used in expressions of tārof or to sort of "congratulate" someone whose guest has arrived. In the above expressions, eyes are used to indicate that someone is looking forward to seeing you. Cheshm entezār is used when there is more time remaining before a person's arrival. This is kind of the "waiting" period. Now I get frequent messages from cousins telling me that they are cheshm entezār for my next Iran trip. Cheshm be rāh is looking forward, like you are almost there, so their eyes are on the road just waiting to see you. My parents were flying in to see me yesterday, so I told them I was cheshm be rāh.
Another common expression using the eyes is ghadam ru cheshm, literally your step on my eye. This is a very polite, respectful way of saying that someone is welcome (they can step on your eyes. That's how welcome they are!) While I was in Yazd, I met my friend's aunt. She told me that she would love to visit the U.S. one day. I told her ghadam ru cheshm meaning that she was welcome any time, and I would be at her service to show her around or help her with anything else that she needed.
You'll also hear people simply say chashm, eye, as a polite form of saying ok. The most common way to say ok is bāshe. But to be a little more polite say chashm. For example, my cousin asked me to send her the pictures from Iran. I could say chashm or even bāshe chashm. It's also possible to say ru cheshmam, on my eye. This is a much more formal, polite way of saying chashm meaning you are more than happy to do something and will do it from the bottom of your heart.
I think like most people, I cringe at the sound of my own voice, so I don't like to record audio. But since many of you have asked... ru cheshmam.
