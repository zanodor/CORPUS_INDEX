The Sumerian Scribe
20-26 minutes
During the long ordeal of translating Tablet #36, I had many occasions
to think about the scribe who wrote it ‐ and not always with a great deal of
affection. I would often address him in my mind, saying things like, "Can't
you just spell it out? Just once, spell it out!"; and
sometimes, "*#x@%!!!". One time I even yelled aloud, "Are you trying to
drive me crazy?" when I was the only one in the room. But I hasten to
add, lest anyone think I am too much the crackpot, that I never heard him
answer me back. Whenever I would translate a line that
seemed particularly wild or funny, I would wonder, "Who could have
written such a thing?" So I had many occasions to speculate about who he
was, and what he was like.
Tablet #36 isn't signed, so the name of the scribe isn't known.
Throughout these pages
I refer to him as "the scribe", which sometimes seems kind of awkward.
On this page I will use the name I have given him, Inim Shukur. It's meant
to sound like a Sumerian version of William Shakespeare, and it literally
means "Word Spear". It's who he is and what he does. His piercing satire

slays The Great Fatted Bull. His signature is at the bottom of the page
(and yes, there were Sumerians named Inim, "word"). I don't often refer to
him by this name; to me, he's just "my bud", "my boy".
I have considered the possibility that Shukur wasn’t a scribe at all. Not
everyone who could write was a full-time scribe. Some were simply
merchants, who had to write in order to keep track of their inventory and
business transactions. However, the language of The Great Fatted Bull is
too sophisticated to have been written by someone who was only casually
acquainted with the complexities of narrative cuneiform writing. The story
is just too literary to have been written by a businessman, or the like.
There can be little doubt that the story of The Great Fatted Bull was
written by a full-time “wordsmith”.
Today we use the word “scribe” to mean a lowly clerical worker, so it
may surprise some readers to learn that Shukur was definitely one of the
social elite. In Sumer, a scribe was one of the few people in a town or
village (or the world, for that matter) who could read and write.
He was vital to the operations of business, religion, the state, and the
community.
In Sumerian society, a scribe was a person of considerable importance and
status.
A study was recently done on the personal seals, the official
“signatures” of the scribes (some of which are seen below and in the
Images section). On the seals the scribes would identify themselves,
usually in the manner of: “Lugal-e-ban-sha/ scribe/ son of Ur-Ishtaran ..."
Of the scribes whose lineages could be traced, 70% were the known sons of
the nobility,
high temple officials, and rich merchants. Which on second thought is not
very surprising;
years of training in a scribal school was very expensive, and only the rich
could afford it.
If Shukur was the son of a rich merchant, he probably became a scribe
to help in the family business. A scribe could also be assigned to a temple,
recording the many donations of sheep, cattle, and grain that were given
by the people for the gods. Perhaps he was a part of the judicial system,
recording the verdicts of trials, or he could be a teacher in one of the
many scribal schools. A scribe could be in the service of a high-ranking

official, such as
Lugal-e-ban-sha, the scribe for the governor of Umma. In addition to his
official duties, a scribe also had various functions within the community;
for instance, reading and writing letters for people (which would also be a
good way to make some extra money). These are the kind of
things a scribe did for a living (he didn’t have a lot of time to sit around
writing great literature). Anything in the town or village that had to be
read or written had to pass through the hands of a scribe. At the very least
it afforded him a comfortable living; it’s unlikely that any scribe ever
went hungry for lack of paying work. A scribe was affluent, if not well-to
do, able to provide a good standard of living for himself and his family,
without the back-breaking labor and the constant threat of hunger that
was the fate of most people in the ancient world. And there was no limit to
a scribe’s future, he could even be a member of the king's court, reading
and writing the royal correspondence.
The upwards mobility of money. This is the official seal of a scribe, a
person of great importance in Sumerian society. An elaborate seal like this
one was very expensive and it displayed the high status of the owner. This
scribe is a member of the court of Shu-Suen, the king who is seated on a
throne. The king, in a shepherd's hat, is depicted as a living god.
The goddess, wearing a horned helmet, who ushers the scribe into the
king's presence, has her arms raised in the "reverence position". The king
symbolically presents the scribe with a vial of oil for annointing, a singular
honor from the god-king. Notice how the scribe doesn't hold up his hands
in reverence like the goddess who accompanies him. It seems odd that a
goddess raises her arms in reverence to the god-king, when a mere mortal
does not. This suggests that the scribe is a member of the high nobility, or
even the royal family itself. If so, he (or his father) had probably married
into royalty rather than being born into it, because the writing on the seal
reads: "Shu-Suen/ Mighty king/ King of Sumer/ King of the Four Quarters

[of the World]/ Ur-kununna/ Scribe/ Son of Lu-Ningirsu, kurushda/
Your servant". A kurushda is someone who runs a large stockyard
where animals (sheep, cattle, pigs, etc.) are fattened before they are sent to
market. It's the occupation of the scribe's father. Click here to enlarge
the seal. Also see: scribal social ranking on cylinder seal impressions.
Is it possible that Shukur, like some other scribes, was actually a
member of the royalty? I seriously doubt it. I think we can discount that
possibility right from the get-go, given the satirical tone of the
writing. However, it is entirely possible that he was a son of the nobility.
He could have been someone like Voltaire (1694-1778 A.D.), a member of
the minor nobility who was not above making fun of lords and
kings. Although it's possible, it’s still unlikely, and for the same reason: the
story is just too sarcastic to have been written by any member of the
ruling class, regardless of how minor (even Voltaire didn't ridicule the
nobility so severely).
Since there’s no other evidence that Shukur was of noble birth, it would
be unreasonable to assume it. I also think it unlikely that he was a temple
scribe, simply because there is no religious context to the story. It’s my
guess that Shukur was the son of a rich merchant and therefore of
common birth, like the hero of his story, the shepherd brother. Not being a
“blueblood” meant that the highest positions in the kingdom were not
available to Shukur, since these usually went to the sons of royalty and the
ranking nobility. Otherwise the courts were open to him, as they were
open to any scribe. The content of the story suggests he was familiar with
the nobility, or at least the local gentry, but the tone of the story suggests
he wasn’t a part of it.
What about the man himself, what was he like? I always thought of
him as an older man, middle aged or older. One reason why I think this is
the “handwriting” on the tablet. It is very quick and sure, as if from many
years of practice. This, by itself, doesn’t mean a lot; a younger man could
also have handwriting that's quick and sure. Another reason is the
sophistication of the language used in the story. Cuneiform writing (which
bore little resemblance to spoken Sumerian) was difficult to master,
requiring many years of study. Shukur uses the language with great skill
and dexterity; he seems to be a very experienced writer, he may even have
been a scribal school master. But then again, it’s also possible that
The Sumerian Scribe about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/34101/index.html

a talented young man could have written the story. The main reason why I
think Shukur is an older man is the “sarcastic” tone of the story. This, at
first, might seem like a contradiction; today we associate sarcasm with
youth. Young people today, who have only a sophomoric understanding of
the world, and who have watched too much TV and seen too many movies,
often adopt a flip and sarcastic attitude as a way of being “cool”. The
writing on this tablet seems different. It doesn’t display the affected
cynicism of a callow youth, instead it shows the mature wisdom that
comes with age, the kind of wisdom that is accrued through a lifetime
of experience. Although sarcastic, the humor in this story is never bitter,
vain, or resentful, as one would expect from a spoiled young man, rather it
is the broad humor of an older man, one who is better acquainted with
“the ways of the world”.
He lived in turbulent times, in a rough and tumble world filled
with violence and warfare. For Shukur, this tablet wasn't just some
academic exercise; it was an accurate reflection of the world he lived in.
Nor was he writing this story from the safe remove of time and distance,
it was his life. So it’s remarkable that the humor in the story is without
rancor, and that it even displays some optimism: Good eventually wins out
over Evil, at least for a while.
Two tablets from the scribe Lugal-e-ban-sha. To the left is a
tablet dated "The year the city of Harshi and it's territories were destroyed
in a single day". The tablet on the right is dated "The year after the city of
Kimash was destroyed." This indicates how much warfare was
a part of daily life in ancient Sumer. The cities named are enemy towns.
The Sumerian towns destroyed in retaliation were seldom mentioned in
the year-names of the Sumerian calendar. The image shows a seated
goddess. In front of her is Lugal-e-ban-sha himself.
He would be shown with his hands raised in the "reverence position". His
brother, En-kash, was also a scribe, as was his son, Ur-ma-ni. Click here

Shukur himself was certainly bright and intelligent, with a ready wit
and an easy laugh. He also had a philosophical frame of mind, which
makes him one of the world’s first “laughing philosophers”. As a scribe,
he was definitely well-educated. In 2000 B.C., scribes were some of the
most educated men in the world. Not only were they able to read and
write, they were also instructed in math, science, business, and literature,
so they could write of these things intelligently. Shukur was also, no
doubt, “good company”. Someone once wrote, “We are sometimes
surprised by the modernity of our ancient ancestors.” Were Shukur alive
today, he would be someone you'd want to hang around with, to share a
few drinks, to discuss politics and philosophy, or to just joke around and
have a good time. He would certainly have some good stories to tell.
The story of The Great Fatted Bull is about any tyrant, anywhere in the
world, at any time in history. But it’s interesting to speculate: did Shukur
have someone specific in mind?
Is Lu-mah based on a real man? It’s possible that Shukur actually
knew the Lord Lu-mah, The Great Fatso Himself, in person. He may have
sat in the same banquet hall with Lu-mah, watching him eat. The lord, by
his physique or his temperament, may have been flattered to be called
“The Bull”. Although Sumerians sometimes used the image of a bull to
represent wanton destruction, a bull usually symbolized strength and
heroism. Gods and kings were often likened to bulls. The lord may have
even called himself “The Bull”, but no one would dare call him “the fatted
bull” to his face.
Man, bull, god.
In America, we’re accustomed to ridiculing our leaders to death. We call
George W. Bush every kind of idiot that we can think of, then ask him to

negotiate with our foreign enemies. We pull Bill Clinton's pants down in
public, then push him onto the world stage. We forget
that throughout history, ridiculing a powerful ruler was once a dangerous
thing to do, anywhere in the world, and it’s still a dangerous thing to do in
most of the world today. If Shukur was a modern Iraqi, he would be
murdered immediately if he had written The Great Fatted Bull about
Saddam Hussein. In the ancient world, this kind of ridicule of the nobility
simply wasn’t tolerated, not even in the more advanced societies like those
of the Greeks and Romans. Back then, a lord knew that if he allowed
himself to be openly ridiculed in public he would not remain a lord for
long. Anyone caught insulting a lord or a king was severely punished, and
probably killed, as an example to everyone else. There was no talk about
“freedom of speech” or “civil rights”. There were no legal niceties.
Punishment was swift, violent, and merciless. History is littered with the
bodies of men who thought they could get away with mocking
the ruling class.
Historical speculations aside, however, there is still the tablet itself. In
the story, the shepherd brother gives Lu-mah the least little bit of backtalk
(it’s a mild rebuke, really, considering the circumstances) and he gets
beaten half to death for it. Perhaps Shukur’s status as a scribe would save
him from the worst kind of punishment, maybe he wouldn't be
flogged like the shepherd brother, but at the very least he would be
instantly hated by every powerful lord in the kingdom, men on whom his
livelihood (and life) depended. If the story was considered generic enough,
that is, if it didn't apply to one particular lord, then Shukur might have
possibly gotten away with it, in much the same way that Voltaire got away
with it. On the other hand, if some lord who too much resembled Lu-mah
took this story to be a personal attack on himself, then no telling what
would happen to the scribe who wrote it.
In the Annotations I say “the scribe could never ‘publish' this story or
even quote it aloud at his local tavern”. Needless to say, there was no
“publishing industry” in ancient Sumer, and there was no such thing as
paper. Various literary tablets were hand-copied by the scribes and passed
around to each other. In this way, popular stories got some kind of
circulation, but most tablets (about 97% of them) were business records.
Of the literary tablets, most were straightforward accounts of well-known
mythological tales and historic events. There were few, if any, stories like

The Great Fatted Bull making the rounds in Sumerian society. There were
few original works of fiction, and there were none where the content of a
tablet was so incendiary. Nor was it the kind of story that someone could
loudly proclaim in a bar, among strangers. Some of the people in the bar
could be potential informants, people willing to curry favor or reward
from some great lord by pointing out the "speaker of evil".
This begs the question: If it was dangerous to even speak of the
contents of this tablet,
then why write it down at all? The answer to this question is in two parts.
Two bull/men subdue a man/bull. Or is it the other way around? The
subject matter of this gold pendant isn't known, but it's bound to be an
interesting story. Enlarge.
First of all, Shukur is a writer. A writer writes. It's in his nature. A
writer is someone who has something to say about his life and the world.
Shukur spent his days writing what other people wanted him to write;
receipts, ledgers, records keeping, etc. This tablet is what he
wanted to write about, what he wanted to say about the world he lived in.
I'm willing to bet he was very proud of this tablet. He must have known
that it was better than anything else ever written. For him, it was his own
personal masterpiece. It was an example of his best craftsmanship, the
best composition he could produce using the tools of his trade. Which
must have been something of a dilemma for Shukur. He had this great
story, but he couldn't really tell anyone about it. I’d like to believe that the
story got some kind of public reading or performance and
that Shukur could at least enjoy some local notoriety as the author of The
Great Fatted Bull, but I think it's unlikely. When this tablet was written,
Sumerian kings were worshiped as living gods; they weren't well known
for their self-deprecating sense of humor. They would not be amused by

Tablet #36.
The fact that Inim Shukur asserts that a king is not a god, but just a
man, is enough to guarantee that the tablet could never be published (the
shepherd brother gets whipped for saying the exact same thing, lines r1
through r3). I doubt that even a benign king like Gudea would tolerate the
idea of the sex life of a great lord being publically ridiculed and the
attempted assassination of a king being turned into some big joke. That is
why I believe the story was never performed in public. This brings us back
to the original question: why would the scribe risk writing it down in the
first place? It really is a great story; but is it worth getting beaten for it, or
perhaps even killed? This leads us to the second part of the answer:
That is why the tablet is written in code, so its contents couldn’t easily
be deciphered.
Sumerians sometimes encoded business transactions to keep them
secret. This was easy enough to do, simply substitute a few signs for each
other; for instance, for “cattle” write “dog”, for "sell" write "run". The
buyer and seller would each have a key with which to decode
the signs. Tablet #36 is the only known literary tablet that is "encoded".
This kind of encoding was easier done in Sumerian than in English. In
English, words are instantly recognizable on the page. It wasn’t this way in
Sumerian. A scribe did not so much “read” a line of text as “translate” it,
because each of the signs had multiple meanings. He would first need to
scan the signs in a line of text. Then, if he knew the context (subject) of the
story, he could eliminate the many alternative meanings of the signs and
use only those that made sense within the context of the story. If
the context of the writing isn’t known, it is difficult to
read a simple Sumerian sentence, even for another Sumerian. (Imagine
trying to read this sentence if every word in it had multiple meanings and
pronunciations). Because the context of Tablet #36 is deliberately
obscured (see Transliteration and Appendix A) it is impossible to
just casually read this tablet. If the tablet was placed in a stack with other
tablets, it could be “hidden in plain sight”, in the same way it was hiding in
plain sight at the Library of Congress when I first found it more than
4,000 years later. It’s therefore unlikely that the tablet was ever
read by another Sumerian.
As I stated in the Introduction, the story of The Great Fatted Bull was
The Sumerian Scribe about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/34101/index.html
9 of 11 8/18/2020, 5:34 PM



probably known to only a few of the scribe’s most trusted friends and
colleagues. That's because he needed to tell someone about the tablet. A
writer writes because he wants to be read. It's reasonable to assume that
Shukur shared the tablet with some of his friends, like-minded people that
he knew he could trust. Shukur showed the tablet to some of his scribal
buddies. He pointed out some of the signs. "You see how what I did here,
substituted mah2 fo mah?" he would say. "Pretty clever, don't you think?"
No one else actually read the tablet, but only heard it recited.
Here’s how I see it happening. Shukur and his buddies are sitting
around drinking beer. The Sumerians drank beer through long straws
(several feet in length) from a pot on the floor, as illustrated above.
Sometimes it was a communal pot of beer, with several people drinking
from it at the same time. The straw was used to avoid the foul-tasting
foam on top of the beer. (I’m not sure why the Sumerians didn’t use a
shorter straw, as we do today. Queen Pu-abi, who was barely five feet tall,
had a gold drinking straw that was almost four feet long. Perhaps
it was like the modern college trick of drinking alcoholic beverages
through a straw to heighten the intoxication; Sumerian beer was not very
strong). After a night of drinking and hilarity, the discussion turns to
politics and “the ways of the world”. Shukur gets up, grabs an oil lamp,
and staggers to a nearby table. He starts rummaging through a stack of
cuneiform tablets. His friends look at each other and roll their eyes. They
know what he is up to, and they know there’s nothing they can do to stop
him. Nor do they want to, they know that the story of The Great Fatted
Bull gets better with each re-telling, with the added details that Shukur
always throws in. He returns to his seat, but he doesn't sit down; he needs
to move around to tell this story. Still standing, he bends over to take
another long draw of beer. Shukur straightens up; his eyes are bright, he’s
smiling. He holds the tablet at arm’s length (the tablet is just a prop; he

doesn’t need to read it, he knows it by heart) and he begins to tell the
story. It’s always a dramatic recitation, and if he’s drunk enough, he acts it
out. His voice changes, depending on the character; it becomes deeper
when he speaks as the fatted bull, it’s high and fluty when he speaks as the
mother. Shukur makes comical exaggerated bows when he addresses "The
Great Fatso". Then he throws in a few suggestive comments when he
talks about the wife and the neighbor woman (like most Sumerians, his
humor is sometimes rather crude). He pauses for dramatic effect at the
appropriate places, or at the “laugh lines”. His friends begin to throw in
their own comments. As Shukur gets more and more wound up
(now he’s “playing to the audience”) his comments become wilder and
more exaggerated. He rocks back on his heels, and laughs at his own jokes.
..
When you read the story of The Great Fatted Bull, you can hear him
still, laughing through the ages.

Seal of the scribe Ur-ku-nun-na. He likewise does not hold up his
hands in reverence. This means he was part of the high nobility or perhaps
the royal family itself, even though his father was a mere karushda, an
animal fattener who runs a stockyard. See "The Scribe".
The seal of a scribe. Coincidentally, he is also named Ur-Shul-pa-e. He
is a scribe in the king's court, which would suggest he's a member of the
nobility. If so, he is probably of the minor nobility, or he may be the son of
a rich merchant. The scribe is the son of Ur-Ha-ia; who is a nobody,
apparently, as no title is given. The king welcomes the scribe into his
court, but the protocol is different than the one accorded to the scribe Ur
ku-nun-na. Ur-Shul-pa-e is shown bearing an offering (a kid lamb?) or gift
(a statue?) to the king. The offering indicates the scribe is of a lesser rank
than Ur-ku-nun-na, the son of the kurushda, the animal fattener.

Arad2-zu: your servant. Arad means slave/servant. These signs were
carved into the margin outside of the border for the rest of the writing
after the seal had already been manufactured. There are many other
examples of preexisting cylinder seals with the words "your servant"
carved into the margins, almost as an afterthought or a "p.s." It seems that
sometime during the reign of Amar-Suen, the phrase "your servant"
became part of the standard protocol when addressing the king, so the
scribes who made their cylinder seals early in the king's reign later had to
add the words to their seals. The words "arad-zu" is often translated
as "your slave" rather than "your servant", though this seems an unlikely
translation in the context of willing service to the king.
The scribe Ur-Shul-pa-e had the words "your servant" added to his
cylinder seal at a later date. These words were already included on the
seals of Arad-Nanna and Ur-ku-nun-na.

Early Old Babylonian?

Ruins of the city of Umma. This photograph shows the extensive
damage caused by looters since the beginning of the Iraq war.
The Library of Congress has not published the provenance of Tablet
#36. So it's not known where the tablet was found or the archaeological
context in which it was discovered.
The Library of Congress has Tablet #36 dated in the (late) Ur III
period. The CDLI has it dated as (Early) Old Babylonian. When I was
translating this tablet, I was unaware of the CDLI's dating, and had
accepted the LoC's Ur III date. During my research, I didn't see any
compelling reason to change my mind about it because I saw a lot of Ur III
tablets that looked just like this one. But then again, some Early Old

Babylonian tablets also looked the same, so from the beginning I’ve known
that the tablet might be Early Old Babylonian (I love that
expression, Early Old Babylonian). The truth is, there’s not a lot
of difference in the writing between Late Ur III and Early Old Babylonian.
Late Ur III is the period just before the fall of Sumer, and EOB is the
period right after it.
When I first learned of the CDLI's dating, I wasn't very happy about it. I
wanted the
Ur III date which would make this tablet unequivocally Sumerian. I have
to admit, I have something of an attitude towards the Babylonians. To me,
they are the nouveau riche, the "Johnny-come-latelys", who didn't even
show up until after 2000 B.C.
I always had one qualm, however, about the Ur III dating. It was my
belief that the tablet may have been “preserved” when the city was
destroyed, which leaves some doubt as to the fate of the scribe who wrote
it (see cuneiform tablet in the Invention of Writing). If the tablet was
indeed written in EOB times, it means the scribe had survived the fall of
Sumer, and was perhaps writing of recent events. It’s a thought I find
reassuring, so if the tablet is ultimately found to be Early Old Babylonian,
then it’s fine by me (with a couple of provisos).
Tablet dated "The year Ur was besieged by the Elamites." The Sumerian
civilization was destroyed by the Elamites and then later adopted by the
Akkadians/Babylonians.
If Tablet #36 is EOB, that means it was written soon after the final
collapse of Sumerian civiization (dated by historians as the fall of the city
of Ur, at around 2004 B.C.). This tablet may even be a description of the

turbulent events leading up to the Fall of Sumer, or it may be a description
of the chaotic period of instability that immediately followed.
Although the tablet may be dated Early Old Babylonian, it is clearly
Sumerian. Anyone writing in the early EOB period was most likely born
and raised Sumerian, and doubtless thought of themselves as Sumerian,
even after the fall of Ur. The tablet may be expressing a yearning for the
return of the righteous Sumerian shepherd kings.
All speculation aside, however; there is still the tablet itself. Tablet #36
is written in the
Sumerian language, not the Akkadian language. The crux of the tablet,
"Lu-mah", is a pun on Sumerian words, not Babylonian words, and the
story itself is distinctly Sumerian. The bullman is a common motif for
Sumerians, but not for Akkadians. The hero of the story is a Sumerian
shepherd king. The story of The Great Fatted Bull is quintessentially
Sumerian.
When I first translated this tablet, I had not yet discovered tablet BE
31,28,
The Princess Wife, and tablet SEM 114, The Great Fatted Jackass. All three
stories are
variations on the same theme. I believe Tablet #36 was the original story,
and it was probably derived from an early Sumerian fable. Tablets BE
31,28 and SEM 114 came later. They are dated in the Old Babylonian
period; not Early Old Babylonian, just Old Babylonian. I suggest that even
if all three tablets were dated Old Babylonian, more than a hundred years
after the fall of Sumer, they were still written by Sumerians
Being a scribe would be the natural occupation of many Sumerians
who survived the fall of Sumer. The written word still used the Sumerian
sign system. Administrative tablets continued to be written in Sumerian.
Literary and religious works were written in Sumerian, long after
Sumerian ceased to be a spoken language, and Sumerian compositions
were studied in scribal schools throughout the entire Old Babylonian
period (1900 – 1600 B.C.).
The Babylonians co-opted Sumerian literature as their own. Most of
the examples of Sumerian literature that are found on the ETCSL were
written during the Old Babylonian period, hundreds of years after the end
of Sumerian civilization. Why is that? Why were the great works of

literature written in the Sumerian language rather than the Akkadian
language of the Babylonians?
It’s natural to assume that the scribes writing during the Old
Babylonian period were
of course Babylonian. I suggest otherwise, that most of the scribes were
Sumerians. I’m sure scribal schools were the enclaves of Sumerians and
their descendants who took pride in their heritage and who sought to keep
the memory of Sumer alive. They continued to identify themselves as
Sumerians, not Babylonians.
The Sumerians scribes were very proud of their culture (rightfully so).
They cherished
the memory of Sumer and tried to keep it alive for as long as possible. As
time went on,
it became obvious that the Sumerian civilization would not once again rise
from the ashes,
as it did several times before. Although they outwardly conformed to
Babylonian culture,
which was not too dissimilar from their own, they tried to maintain their
unique identity as Sumerians. In their hearts and minds, they were still
Sumerians.
For hundreds of years the Babylonian kings continued to model
themselves on the shepherd kings of Sumer. Even if many of the
Babylonian kings were good kings, the Sumerians wouldn’t think so. They
would disdain the Babylonian kings as pale imitations of the original
Sumerian kings, and therefore subject to ridicule. The Sumerian scribes
were irreverent outsiders, despite their assimilation into Babylonian
culture. They, not the
native-born Babylonian scribes, were the ones most likely to have a
jaundiced view of the Babylonian god-kings. They could not resist a king
with weapons. This kind of resistance
was out of the question, but they could resist the king with words, with
satire. I suggest the
three satires of The Great Fatted Bull, The Princess Wife, and The Great
Fatted Jackass,
can properly be considered as “Notes from the Sumerian Underground.”

Enlarge.
This cylinder seal impression shows a victorious Babylonian king treadng
upon a
long-haired barbarian enemy. According to the Penn Museum, the king
holds a “sheaf of
six weapons with round heads like clubs”, but I think it is a headdress
taken from the
enemy chieftain. The Penn Museum states that the writing means “Ka
Nannarzu, scribe,
son of Lulamu.”, but I suggest it should read “Saĝ-Nanna-zu, scribe, son of
Ka5-a-mu”.
The scribe, the owner of the seal, is on the left. He has a shaven head. He
wears a
long robe and a necklace, an “emblem of his dignity”.
This is an important seal. According to the Penn Museum, this is the first
time that a Babylonian king wears a Sumerian shepherd crown. This is a
“landmark in the history
and art of Babylon”.
The scribe is a Sumerian.

Tablet #36: The story of The Great Fatted Bull
Perhaps the Library of Congress has some documentation that will help
establish when and where this tablet was written. Meanwhile, the
important thing to remember about the tablet is it’s Sumerian, not
Babylonian.
