IRAN iv. MYTHS AND LEGENDS
IRAN
iv. MYTHS AND LEGENDS
Introduction. In popular usage “myth” is equated with something
being false or illusory. In the study of religion, in contrast, myths are
seen as narratives whichencapsulate fundamental truths about the
nature of existence, God(s), the universe. They explain the origin of
the world or of a tribe or of a ritual. They concern life after death,
embody an understanding of right and wrong, convey messages of
salvation or damnation. Myths are commonly thought to make past
events or forces “really” present, especially when acted out in ritual.
They are therefore sources of spiritual power. The origin, function,
and legitimation of rites are commonly contained in myths. Various
scholars have sought to establish broad patterns and types of myths
(Eliade, 1963 and 1965, Sharpe, Whaling; for an overview of debate,
see Bolle, pp. 261-73). Typologies have value, but commonly myths
are conditioned by the culture in which they emerged, and to whose
formation and development they have often contributed. Legends
are stories which are seen to have a basis, however remote, with
people who are thought to have lived on earth in historical time,
though they often portray abstract ideas about valor, good heroes,
and wicked tyrants. The distinction between myth and legend can in
practice be difficult to identify.
Iranian myths and legends incorporate a variety oftraditions. The
many precise parallels between Iranian mythology and much early
Indian imagery clearly reflect their common heritage—for example,
the respective myths concerning the first human being and parallels
between Ir. Yima and Ind. Yama, the god of death in Vedic thought.



The remarkable parallels between Iranian eschatology and Norse
myths are so striking that some scholars have suggested they reflect
fossilized versions of Indo-European mythology (Puhvel). Some
Achaemenid inscriptions on royal reliefs suggest that the Persian
empire not only incorporated the Babylonian kingdom, but also some
of its myths about kingship (Hinnells, 1985, pp. 98-109). Eastern Iran
appears to have had especially rich traditions of myths and legends.
This article cannot cover all the many bodies of material which
flourished in Iran, such as the Ossetic tradition or Manicheism. It
focuses on the diverse body of material preserved in Zoroastrian
literature, the great Iranian epic, the Šāh-nāma (Levy), and the
romance of Vis and Ramin (Morrison). It also includes some
references to Greek traditions about the great Zoroastrian monarchs.
Much of the material was transmitted by priests in the religious
setting, for myths were part of Zoroastrian teaching. Legendary
material, and some myths, were transmitted by minstrels at court or
in numerous public events for musicians and singers (Boyce, 1954
and 1957).
In any religion or culture one often finds more than one myth or
legend on the same subject. Just as Biblical scholars detect two
creation myths in the book of Genesis, so in Iran there are various
accounts of the firsthuman being or first king (Christensen). These
poetic narratives do not necessarily indicate various ‘sectsʼ but may
be alternative perspectives on ‘ultimate truthʼ. This is evident in
ancient Indian traditions concerning creation. One should not expect
coherent logic, although it is remarkable how coherent much Iranian
mythology is.
This article will first look at various types of Iranian myths, cross
referring where possible to other entries in EIr., and will relate some
myths briefly in order to highlight the understanding they contain of
the cosmos, of good and evil, the physical world, and human nature.



The categories used here, such as Hero Myths and Nature Myths,
are widely used in the study of religions. Typologies of myths are
useful, but there are few clearly demarcated types, so myths are not
necessarily either one type or the other. Myths are complex
interpretations of existence, on which members of the appropriate
religion base much of their belief and practice. That complexity will
be illustrated in the course of this article, as will be the difficulty in
drawing a clear line between myth and legend.
Myth and the cosmos. The major account of the ancient Iranian
image of the cosmos is in the Bundahišn (q.v.). The earth is thought
of as round and originally flat, lying on the cosmic waters as a yolk
floats in an egg, encased by the sky (āsmān, q.v.) as in a bag,
originally thought to be made of stone, later of shining metal (see
COSMOGONY AND COSMOLOGY). Originally the sun stood still at
the noonday position; all was perfect and still. The original material
creations were the sky, water, earth, tree, beneficent animal, the first
human, and fire. Between earth and sky were the luminaries: moon,
sun, and the constellations. Mount Alborz (q.v.) ringed the earth.
When later the rains came (see below on creation myths), two rivers
flowed from the north, one towards the east, one towards the west.
They flowed over the earthʼs edge and back into the cosmic ocean
below. In the ocean grew the tree of many seeds, and from that
came 130,000 species of plants. Next to it is the Haoma (q.v.) or
Gōkarn tree, from which the elixir of immortality will be produced at
the renovation (Frašō.kərəti, q.v.). Evil produced alizard to destroy
the Haoma, but two “Kar fish” protect it: “those fish are so sensitive
that they comprehend sensation as minute as a sharp needle in the
deep water ...” (Greater Bundahišn 24.A5; Anklesaria, 1956, p. 193).
The mountains all grew from the roots of Alborz, the mountain of
divine destiny, which grew to the sky. From its peak is the Bridge of
Judgement. The earth was divided into the seven kešvars (Haft



kešvar, q.v.); half of the land mass forms the central block of land,
Xwanirah, with the other six around it. It is in Xwanirah that heroes of
the Mazdayasnian religion are produced, as the savior, Saošyant, will
be at the renovation. It was possible to pass from one region to
another on the back of the bull Hadhyaš or Srisōk.
The Bundahišn repeatedly asserts that it quotes Scripture in its
account of the cosmos. The account is embedded within a complex
astrology, so the twelve con-stellations of the zodiac are said to side
with Ohrmazd (Avestan: Ahura Mazdā, q.v.), and the seven planets
are said to be on the side of Ahriman (q.v.). The Bundahišn displays
traditional theological fascination with classifications, for example, of
types of beneficial animals, of noxious creatures, mountains, rivers,
seas, animals, and fish.
Mythic creatures and legendary heroes. Mythology in any culture
commonly includes stories of fabulous creatures, and these are
found in Iran also, particularly in the Bundahišn. The most vivid such
figure is the ass with three legs, six eyes, nine mouths, two ears, and
one horn. It is so large that just one of its feet covers an area of land
on which a thousand sheep could be assembled. With its huge horn
it destroys the worst pests among noxious creatures. When it moves
in the cosmic ocean, Vouru-kaṧa, it shakes the entire ocean whose
waters it purifies (G.Bd. 24.10-21).
A mythological creature which stimulated much interest was the
Simorḡ (Saēna) bird, which sits on the tree of healing in the middle of
Vourukaṧa and shakes the branches so seeds are scattered and
fertilize the earth. The Simorḡ appears in much Sasanian art,
particularly bowls and ewers. It also features in the Šāh-nāma. The
warrior Sām cursed his child (later named Zāl) forhaving white hair
and commanded him to be left to die in a remote spot. Seeing him
from her eyrie, the Simorḡ planned to feed him to her brood, but she



was inspired to protect the child. When he grew to magnificent
manly stature, Sām heard of the famed youth and came searching
for him. The Simorḡ took him to his father saying: “take with you a
single feather from my wing and with it you will continue to be under
the protection of my influence. If ever a difficulty overtakes you or
any dispute arises over your actions, good or ill, then cast this
feather of mine into the flames” and she would “come as a black
cloud, with speed, to help” (Levy, p. 38). Zāl became a noble prince
and fell in love with Rudāba “dark eyed and with blushing cheeks, as
beautiful as the moon,” and their union resulted in the birth of the
famed Persian hero, Rostam. But the birth proved dangerous. Zāl,
recalling the Simorḡʼs promise, burned one of the featherʼs barbs.
The great bird came instantly, eager to serve. She called for a wizard
“versed in incantation” and extracted the baby from her side; the
wound was healed by a herbal potion devised by the Simorḡ—and so
the legendary hero, Rostam, was born. When he grew up, few could
withstand him in battle, until one day he fought with the equally
mighty Esfandiār (q.v.). Wounded, Rostam retreated and confided to
his friends he thought he faced defeat. Zāl again called upon the
Simorḡ, and she rubbed her feathers over his wounds. Rostam was
immediately restored to strength. She counseled him not to fight
such a valorous prince, bearing the divine Farr (see FARR[AH]). If
Rostam submitted, she would save him. But his offer of peace was
rejected, and with the Simorḡʼs aid Rostam shot Esfandiār in the eye,
and so “the world for that nobleman turned to darkness” and he died
(Levy, pp. 206-11).
The story of the Simorḡ illustrates the problem of distinguishing
between myth and legend. The bird in the cosmic ocean is evidently
part of myth; her rescue of Zāl and saving of Rostam are legendary,
with the typical epic interest in fate and magic. Stories can grow and
change in retelling.



The ‘storyʼ of Yima (later Jamšēd) is difficult to reconstruct (see
Christensen, part 2). The key Iranian text is Vendidād [Vidēvdād] 2
(see Lommel, 1927, pp. 196-206). There are at least three strands to
the Yima story. In one he is depicted as the ideal king. Thus in Vd. 2,
after (strangely) refusing Ahura Mazdāʼs suggestion that Yima be the
preacher and bearer of Mazdāʼs Law (referred to also in Dēnkard
[q.v.] VIII.44.3, although he is listed as one who accepted the religion
completely [Dk. V.1.8]), he is given rulership of the world. While he
was king there was neither cold nor hot wind, neither disease nor
death. Humans, creatures, and fires multiplied, so the world doubled
in size. He was, therefore referred to as “shining Yima of good
herds” as he ruled over seven parts the earth, over demons and
mortals, over wizards and witches (Yašt 19.30-33; Hintze, 1994b, pp.
172-90). (See also Yasna 9.4-5; Yt. 5.25-26; Yt. 9. 8-9; Yt. 15.15-16;
Yt. 17.28-30. In the Pahlavi literature, see Dk. VII.1.20-24, VIII.13.7,
IX.21.2-3.) In Dk. IX.5.4 he is said to have driven away four major
vices from existence. Thus Yima is seen as the ideal king, and
Persepolis became known as Taḵt-e Jamšēd, the throne of Jamšēd.
A second theme (Vd. 2.21-43) is the story of the terrible winter
(caused by the evil Malkūs) which threatened all living creatures.
Yima constructed a Vara or enclosure, in which the seeds of the best
of people, cattle, and trees were kept (see also Dk. VII.1.24,
VIII.44.4). It is said in Dādestān ī Mēnōg ī xrad (q.v., hereafter DMx)
62.15 to be in Ērānwēz (q.v.) and below the earth. In the Bundahišn
(33.30) the winter is an eschatological assault of evil in its death
throes (see also Dk. VII.9.3-4; Dādestān ī denīg [q.v., hereafter DD;
the only Eng. tr. remains West, 1882]) 37.94-95; DMx 27.27-31). A
third theme is Yimaʼs sin of lying, which results in him losing the
divine glory (xwarrah, Yt. 19.34-36); as it flew away three times in
the shape of a bird of prey, it was seized successively by Mithra,
Thraētaona, and Kərəsāspa/Keresāsp (Hintze, 1994b, pp. 191-202).
His sin is alluded to in the Gāthās (q.v.) in Y. 32.8 (although the



translation is much debated; see Boyce, 1975, pp. 92-98, at p. 93, n.
55). Noreference is made to this sin in the Vendidād, even though it
is the longest passage on Yima. In the Pahlavi literature his sin was
his claim to be the creator (Pahlavi Rivāyat 31; Williams, II, pp. 57
59). DD 39.16-17 states he was deceived by the fiend into wanting
supreme sovereignty instead of serving Ohrmazd. Yt. 19.46 refers to
Aži Dāhaka cutting Yima to pieces (referred to also in Dk. IX.21.2).
(See below on Yima in the Šāh-nāma.) The fragmentary picture
yields no clear ‘story lineʼ.
Myths and legends of monsters and fiends. Hero myths and legends
are a major dimension of any culture, inspiring followers to emulate
the good and oppose—and fear—the evil. They abound in Iran also.
The story of Thraētaona/Ferēdun is a good example. Generally
Zoroastrian literature describes beneficial forces in more detail than
it does evil powers (Boyce, 1975, pp. 85-108). But one demonic
monster is graphically depicted, although the myth is somewhat
fragmentary. It is another example of the difficulty of distinguishing
between myth and legend. Aži Dahāka (Azdaha, q.v.) is described as
a dragon “who had three mouths, three heads, six eyes, a thousand
skills, the very mighty, devilish Falsehood, evil for the world, the
deceitful one” (Yt. 19.37; Hintze, 1994b, p. 22). The same Yašt
relates the story of Aži Dahāka in conflict with the Fire of Ahura
Mazdā for the possession of the xwarrah (46-50). The dragon was
said to have a thousand powers, and to be “of mighty strength ...
whom the evil spirit Angra Mainyu made as the most mighty Drug
[see DRUJ-] who threatened the corporeal world, Iranian
settlements, and the homes of Aṧa” (Y. 9.8; see also Yt. 5.34, Yt.
15.24). Aži Dahāka succeeded Yima when the glory left him, and he
was jointly responsible for sawing the fallen king in half (G.Bd. 35.5).
He took Yimaʼs daughters as his wives. The dragonʼs evil reign lasted
for a thousand years (G.Bd. 33.2, 36.5-6). Dahāka is said to have had



his mansion in Babylon (a symbol of the hated Assyrian empire)
(G.Bd. 32.4, Dk. VII.4.72). He is said to have been one of the last to
rule all seven regions; his desire was to rid them of people, but
Anāhitā (Anāhid, q.v.) rejected his plea (Yt. 5.29-31, 34-35), as did
Vayu (Yt. 15.19-21). His reign was brought to an end by the heroic
Ferēdun (q.v.) beating him with his club. Ahura Mazdā warned him
not to cut the dragonʼs body, because serpents, toads, scorpions,
lizards, tortoises, and frogs would fill the earth. So Ferēdun bound
the dragon in a cave in Mt. Damāvand (q.v., Dk. IX.21.8-12, relating
the contents of the lost Sūtkar Nask), where he remains bound until
the renovation, when he will break free. But Keresāsp will be raised
again to crush the dragon with his club (DD 37.97). Like all demons
he will be done away with at the renovation (DD 37.121). The texts
give a mixture of pictures of Aži Dahāka as mythical dragon and
legendary wicked monarch, Żaḥḥāk. It is the latter picture which is
set forward in the Šah-nāma.
According to the Šāh-nāma (Levy, pp. 17-25), Żaḥḥāk was born a
courageous youth, the son of the honorable prince, Merdas. One day
the devil, Eblis, arrived disguised as a visitor come to honor him, and
Żaḥḥāk fell under his influence. He asked the visitor to instruct him
and agreed to swear an oath before being taught. Eblis urged
Żaḥḥāk to kill Merdas, because he lingered inoffice, so delaying the
time when Żaḥḥāk could accede to the throne. Żaḥḥāk pleaded that
some other plan bedevised, rather than killing his father, but Eblis
retorted: “if you fail in carrying out my advice, you will dishonor your
pledge and the oath you swore to me.” Żaḥḥāk dug a pit and
camouflaged it with straw, so when his father went out to purify
himself before worship, he fell into the pit and died.
Eblis hatched further plots and presented himself as a renowned
cook. There were few animals then, because humanity was
vegetarian, until Ahriman taught people to kill animals. Eblis provided



food from the bodies of birds and animals, which delighted Żaḥḥāk,
who promised him whatever he desired. The cook asked for
permission to kiss his shoulders as though he was his dearest friend.
But where Eblis kissed him two black serpents grew. Whenever
Żaḥḥāk tried to cut them off, more grew in their place. Eblis
reappeared in the guise of a physician and said cutting them off was
impossible; instead they should be fed only with human brains.
Meanwhile in Iran King Jamšēd became increasingly unpopular with
his subjects, for the royal glory had left him. As turmoil erupted
“Iranian knights in search of a new king turned their attention to
Żaḥḥāk and proclaimed him king of Iran.” The dragon-king raised an
army, including Arabs, attacking Iran as Jamšēd surrendered. When
at last Jamšēd was found, Żaḥḥāk had his body sawn in two. Żaḥḥāk
ruled for a thousand years, when “virtue was humiliated and wizardry
esteemed.” The end finally came through the gallantry of the hero
Ferēdun, on whom the royal glory had settled. Żaḥḥāk had a dream
about his defeat by Ferēdun and searched everywhere for the youth,
killing the heroʼs father, but Ferē-dunʼs mother hid him in the Alborz
mountains. Żaḥḥāk raised an army including demons and peris
(“fairies”) with men. As Żaḥḥāk was consulting his counselors, Kāva,
a blacksmith who had been grievously wronged, entered the royal
presence to protest that Żaḥḥāk had executed seventeen of his
children to feed their brains to the snakes on his shoulders, and he
sought the life of his last son. He thundered: “although you have a
dragonʼs form, you are the king and itʼs your duty to let me have
justice in this thing.” His son was restored to him; but, when Żaḥḥāk
commanded him to sign a document proclaiming that Żaḥḥāk was a
just king, Kāva refused and raged at the councilors who had done so.
He stormed away to seek Ferēdun and raise an army. Together they
marched on Żaḥḥākʼs palace in Jerusalem. Żaḥḥāk was away, so
Ferēdun feasted and dallied with Żaḥḥākʼs wives. Learning of this,



Żaḥḥāk attacked the hero with fury, but Ferē-dun “advanced upon
him with the speed of the storm-wind and dealt him a blow from his
bull-headed mace that shattered his helmet.” An angel quickly
warned him “do not strike him down; his time has not yet come, bind
him firmly as a rock and conceal him in the mountains.” So the
dragon king was bound in fetters in Mount Damā-vand until the end
of history. This ancient Iranian myth clearly lies behind a passage in
the Biblical book of Revelation (Hinnells, 2000, p. 83)
Again, the difference between myth and legend is blurred. In the
early sources Aži Dahāka is a mythical figure and yet also appears as
a king of a physical place. In the legend of the Šāh-nāma the one
thousand year rule, the role of Eblis, the angel guiding Ferēdun make
it, in parts, a myth. Fundamental Iranian and religious values are
evident throughout. Even the evil Żaḥḥāk recognizes that a kingʼs
duty is to give justice. Details like the bull-headed mace and the
belief in Farr, the royal glory, reflect the Zoroastrian elements of the
narratives. These are modified in the light of history; whereas Aži
Dahāka ruled in Babylon, Żaḥḥāk recruits Arabs—an indication of
who is the key enemy changes over time. The mythical/legendary
geography of Mount Damāvand is an example of an enduring motif.
Nature myths. Most ancient cultures have nature myths. These can
be of two types: myths about nature or myths deploying key images
from nature. The former are prominent in the creation myths below,
and they occur in the cosmological myth discussed above. They
explain how the cycle of nature functions.
It is inevitable that a pre-industrial society will utilize nature as the
major source of imagery. An example of this is in the Mithra Yašt (Yt.
10), which has a striking blend of nature and warrior imagery. Mithra
is the first god to travel across Harā, in front of the immortal, swift
horsed sun, who is the first to seize the beautiful, gold-painted



mountain tops; from there the most mighty surveys the land
inhabited by Iranians ... where high, sheltering mountains provide
ample pasture ... for the cattle, where deep lakes stand with surging
waves” (st. 13-14; all quotations are from Gershevitch). Similarly
Mithra is described as “the very great god who in the morning brings
into evidence the many shapes, the creatures of the Incremental
spirit, as he lights up his body, being endowed with [his] own light
like the moon” (st. 142). As in the morning so in the evening “[Mithra]
goes along the whole width of the earth after the setting of the glow
of the sun” (st. 95). He is described as the replenisher of waters
“thanks to whom water [= rain] falls and plants grow” (st. 103).
Another example of nature symbolism is the use of animal imagery to
depict powerful force of divine entities—Vərəthraghna (Victory) “in
the shape of a wild, aggressive, male boar with sharp fangs and
sharp tusks, a boar that kills at one blow, is un-approachable ... and
strong, has iron hind feet, iron fore-feet, iron tendons, and iron tail
and iron jaws” (st. 70).
A stronger theme in the Mithra Yašt, however, is that of the warrior.
Mithra it is whom “the warriors worship at the manes of their horses,
requesting strength for their teams, health for themselves, much
watchfulness against antagonists, ability to strike back at enemies,
ability to rout lawless, hostile opponents” (st. 10-11); he is “the skilful
warrior who has white horses and pointed spears with long shafts,
who shoots afar with swift arrows” (st. 102); he “sets the battle in
motion, who takes his stand in the battle, who smashes the
regiments; the centre of the blood-thirsty army is quaking” (st. 36).
He drives in a “supernaturally fashioned, high wheeled chariot ...” (st.
67) “holding his mace in his hand; with its hundred bosses and
hundred blades” (st. 96); “whose pike is of silver, whose armor is of
gold” (st. 112), “when the whips are tossing, the bow-strings
twanging, the sharp arrows darting ...” (st. 113); and he protects his



worshippers “from the evil armies of the owners of Falsehood” (st.
93). He is also the judge (st. 79, 81, 92), who watches to see that
people observe their contracts/agreements and does so with “a
thousand ears and ten thousand eyes” (st. 91). Other sources
indicate that he was particularly associated with the priesthood, for
the symbol of priesthood is the gurz, the mace of Mithra, and
temples are known as dar-e Mehrs, courts of Mithra. Categorizing,
or producing typologies of, myths can be helpful, but there is a
danger in assuming that there are watertight divisions, as though a
myth belongs to either one type or another. One myth can have
diversity of features and levels of meaning, as the Mithra Yašt
illustrates. Mithra exemplifies another feature of Iranian mythology,
namely, that in comparison with Greek, Roman, Egyptian, and Indian
mythology there are few stories about the lives and deeds of the
gods. In Iranian tradition mythological imagery is used to highlight
details or express abstract ideas, but there is little in the way of
narrative, a theme discussed below.
An interesting nature myth with important theological implications
concerns Tištrya and the demon of drought, Apaoša (Mid. Pers.
Apōš, q.v.). The main text is Yt. 8, but also important is G.Bd., where
Tištrya is identified as Sirius (both being producers of the waters) in
V.A.2, 3, V.B.12, VI.B.1-21, VI.D.1, VIII. 2. The texts (particularly VI.B)
integrate the myth of the former with astrology. There Tištrya is said
to have produced the waters at creation. Each raindrop he produced
was as big as a bowl, so the earth was covered with water to the
height of a man, washing noxious creatures off the face of the earth.
The fourth month of the year is dedicated to Tiš-trya; in the first ten
days he takes the form of a fifteen-year-old male—the perfect age in
ancient Iranian thought. In the second period of ten days he takes
the form of a bull, and in the last ten days the form of a horse. It is in
the last that the main myth is related, the conflict with Apaoša (Yt.



8.20-34; Lommel, 1927, pp. 46-57). Tištrya charged to the cosmic
ocean as a beautiful white horse with golden ears and trappings,
whereas Apaoša was in the form of a black horse, with black ears,
back, and tail. The two fought, hoof against hoof, for three days and
nights until Apaoša overcame Tištrya, who cried to the creator that
he was weak because he had not received the proper prayers and
sacrifices duly offered in his name by humanity. The creator himself
then sacrificed and offered the proper prayers, so that Tištrya gained
the strength of ten horses, camels, and bulls—as well as of ten
mountains and rivers. When Tištrya returned thus fortified to the
fray, he triumphed over the demon of drought, so the rains fell and
fertilized the seven regions of the earth. The myth is important for its
understanding of the function of ritual sacrifice: it is what maintains
the naturalorder. Secondly, sacrifice is a holy activity, something
appropriate for Ohrmazd himself to perform, a theme discussed
below concerning the renovation and Zurvanism. In Iranian thought
sacrifice is not, as is in so many religions, something offered only by
humans in their petitions to, or devotion for, the divine. It is a
powerful, holy act, appropriate for any good power to perform, and
by it world order is sustained and spiritual power is activated.
Another figure associated with water and the source of life is the
female divine power, Arədvi Surā Anāhitā (Anāhid). The key text is Yt.
5, Ābān Yašt (Lommel, 1927, pp. 26-44). She is said to drive a chariot
pulled by four white horses: wind, rain, cloud, and sleet (Yt. 5.11,
120). She nurtures crops and cattle and is the source of fertility,
purifying male sperm and a womanʼs womb as well as a motherʼs
milk; she sends down the waters by day and night (Yt. 5.2, 5). Major
religious figures offer her sacrifice—Ahura Mazdā in Ērānwēz (Yt.
5.17), Yima (Yt. 5.25-7) and Zoroaster—also in Erānwēz (Yt. 5.104
6), and Vištāsp (Goštasp, q.v., Yt. 5.108-10). But she refused the
requests of others, for example Aži Dāhaka (Yt. 5.34) and enemies of



Iran (Yt. 5.58, 117-18). She will not accept libations from the
deformed or wicked (Yt. 5.93-95). She is strong, bright, tall,
beautiful, pure, and nobly born. She wears a golden crown with eight
rays and a hundred stars, and a gold mantle and necklace (Yt. 5.64,
78, 123, 126-29). Such details have led scholars to suggest that
statues of her were erected, as the ancient Greek historian Berossus
reports regarding western parts of the Iranian empire. Other scholars
have suggested that she was incorporated into Iranian mythology
from external (Babylonian?) sources, for there is no obvious Indian
parallel to indicate an Indo-Iranian origin. That is plausible and may
be part of the introduction of statues, which were not part of ancient
Iranian tradition (Boyce, 1982, pp. 201-4). It is possible that a
tradition had more than one fertilityfigure. Mythologies are
commonly complex and evocative, rather than coldly logical. Two
figures associated with one phenomenon are not necessarily
indicative of two ‘sectsʼ. Yašt 5 reinforces the point made above; in
Iranian thought sacrifice is a holy and powerful act initself, one
appropriate for gods as well as humans.
The myth of creation is the most important Zoroastrian nature myth.
The key text is Greater Bundahišn (Anklesaria, 1956, pp. 5-53) but
also important are: DMx 8 and DD 37 (see Pahlavi Rivāyat 46 in
Williams, II, pp. 72-74). The Bd. passages are paraphrased in
Zādspram. Dk. VIII states that myth was in the now lost Avestan
Čihrdād Nask (q.v.). The Creation myth is based on the ancient
Iranian concept of the universe outlined above (see Boyce, 1975, pp.
130-46). The theological understanding of why and how the cosmos
was made is distinctly Zoroastrian. Ahura Mazdā on high in
goodness and omniscience knew Ahriman existed in deepest
darkness, whereas the ignorant Ahriman was unaware of the
creatorʼs existence; between them was the void. Immediately
Ahriman became aware of Ohrmazdʼs existence, true to his malicious



nature, he attacked, seeking to destroy. Failing, he fell back into
darkness and miscreated many dēvs (Daēva, q.v.). Ohrmazd offered
peace if Ahriman would praise the Good Creation; Ahriman,
mistakenly suspecting weakness, refused. Ohrmazd knew it was
necessary to fix a time limit of 9,000 years to the conflict; otherwise
evil could triumph. This condition was accepted by Ahriman in his
stupidity. As Ohrmazd proceeded with his Good Creation from his
essence of light, so Ahriman produced his counter-creation out of
his“essence of darkness in the form of a toad, ashen, worthy of hell,
sinful as is the most sinful noxious beast” (G.Bd. I.47). Each
fashioned the non-material (mēnōg), then the material (gētīg; see
GĒTĪG AND MĒNŌG) forms. First among the Good Creation were the
sacred prayers, specifically the Ahunwar (q.v., an excellent example
of a myth legitimating a ritual), the Beneficent Immortals (Ameṧa
Speṇtas, q.v.) and the material creations of sky, water, earth,
beneficent plant, the uniquely created bull, and the first person,
Gayōmard (see Boyce, 1975, pp. 192-246). He also created Fire,
which permeated all creation. The fravašis were given the choice of
assuming material form in order to fight evil, so they may then again
become perfect and deathless—the ultimate expression of the
Zoroastrian doctrine of free will. Ahriman fashioned the chief
demons and attacked the good creation. He pierced and entered the
middle of the earth from the waters beneath. “And the Sky feared
him as the sheep the wolf ... like a fly; he rushed upon all creation”
(G.Bd. IV.10). He made the midday dark, as if it were night, and set
free noxious creatures with greed, need, and disease upon the Earth,
on the bull and on Gayōmard. On the Fire he inflicted smoke.
The Daēvas and the Yazatas paired off in combat. The whole of the
two creations were in conflict: Falsehood against Truth, the
sorcererʼs spell against the holy manthra, the Evil eye against
spiritual sight, excess and deficiency against right measure, pollution



against purity (see DUALISM). The forces of good and evil are so
different that two vocabularies are used: the good have heads and
hands, they speak, go, and die, whereas the evil have skulls and
claws, they howl, hurtle, and perish. When Ahriman sought to leave
the polluted world, his exit was blocked by the fravašis. He was
trapped in a world characterized by life the opposite of his evil,
destructivenature, in stark contrast to much Indian and
Westernmythology, where spiritual good is imprisoned in an alien
material universe. As the bull and Gayōmard died, each emitted
sperm; from the bull came cattle and plants; from Gayōmardʼs sperm
grew a plant, whose leaves took the form of the first human couple,
Mašye and Mašyāne. Despite being admonished by Ohrmazd to do
good and not worship the demons, they succumbed to evilʼs
seductions and declared the Evil Spirit the creator—the archetypal
Zoroastrian sin. At first they refrained from food, then drank milk,
then ate meat. For fifty years they refrained from sex; but, when they
did copulate, having been led astray by evil, they devoured their
children, until Ohrmazd took away the sweetness of children so the
population could grow. The theological implications of this creation
myth will be discussed below. (For the succeeding legendary history
concerning the Pešdadians and Kayanians, see above, IRAN iii.)
Eschatological myths. These are of two aspects ofZoroastrian
eschatology (q.v.; see also APOCALYPTIC): myths associated with
the end of an individualʼs life and what in the Judeo-Christian world
is called “the end of the world.” In Zoroastrianism the latter is termed
therenovation, for the end of the world would be the defeat of
Ohrmazd. (Boyce, 1984 includes a compendium of translations of
key texts on both.)
The individual judgement after death is found in the Gāthās. where
the prophet states that “the end the Worst Existence shall be for the
wicked, but (the House of) Best purpose for the just man” (Y. 30.4;



Y. 45.8 refers to the House of Song). Y. 31.20 refers to “[a] long life
of darkness, foul food, the crying of woe—to that existence, O
wicked ones, your Inner Self shall lead you by her actions.” In Y.
46.10-11 he explicitly refers to the Činvat bridge (Činwad puhl, q.v.;
see also Y. 51.13), when his opponents will be led by their Inner
Selves (daēna, dēn, q.v.) to the House of the Lie.
This judgement is expounded in greater detail in later literature. (See
Boyce, 1975, pp. 109-29; Hinnells, 1971, pp. 64-67; Lommel, 1930,
pp. 185-204; Pavry, passim. The key texts are G. Bd. 30; DMx 2; DD
20; Pahlavi Rivāyat 23.4; Williams, II, pp. 47-51.) At the first
judgement, individualsʼ good thoughts, words, and deeds are
weighed in the balance against their evil thoughts, words, and deeds
under the just gaze of Mithra, Sraoša, and Rašnu. Such an idea is not
unique in world mythologies; it is found, for example, in Egypt. The
distinctively Zoroastrian element is the consistent emphasis on
individual responsibility based on freedom of choice between the
forces of good and evil. This developed from Zoroasterʼs conviction
of his personal encounter with Ahura Mazdā; of his personal calling,
for which he was set apart from the beginning. After death and
before the judgement at the balances, the soul meditates on its
thoughts, words, and deeds. After judgement it is led by the
personification of its own conscience or Inner Self to the Činwad
bridge, where the righteous are led to the House of Song, while the
wicked fall from the bridge into the House of Darkness. Zoroastrian
theology has no room for a doctrine of one person dying to save
others, or of an inscrutable divine will determining the fate of
individuals. Each individual is judged on the balance of oneʼs own
good and evil thoughts, words, and deeds. Even in the afterlife the
emphasis on individual experience continues. When the Righteous
Virāz (Ardā Virāz, q.v.) experienced his soul journey to heaven and
hell, he saw the rewards or punishments matched to each soulʼs



thoughts, words, and deeds (Gignoux). Zoroastrian funeral rites are
ordered so that certain prayers are offered at each stage of the
soulʼs post-mortem progress. For example, the corpse is laid out so
its head does not point to the north, the abode of demons whence
Nasu came. Prayers are recited to the yazata Sraoša for the
protection of the soul for the first three days after death, while it
meditates on its life. Additional prayers are said on the morning after
the third night, when the soul proceeds to its judgement. Again,
liturgical practice is legitimated by mythology (DD 13-34; Boyce,
1977, pp. 139-63; Modi, pp. 49-81; more generally: Lommel, 1930,
chap. 7; Zaehner, 1961, pp. 302-8).
The final judgement. The first judgement was in the immaterial
(mēnōg) state, for the material (gētīg) body remains on earth (see
GĒTĪG AND MĒNŌG). As the body is part of the Good Creation,
death represents the (temporary) triumph of evil; hence in
Zoroastrianism the theological necessity of the resurrection, so that
individuals may be judged in body as well as in spirit and so that
Ohrmazdʼs creation is not destroyed.
Some Gāthic passages appear to refer to the renovation (Lommel,
1930, chap. 8). Certain details are clearly present—for example, the
judgement by the fire and the molten metal which all pass through
before entering the restored world (Y. 51.9): “that requital which
Thou wilt assign to the two parties, O Mazda, by Thy bright blazing
fire and molten metal to destroy the wicked man, and to save the
just.” Y. 31.19 refers to “the requital promised by fire”; Y. 34.4 refers
to the fire which shall be “of manifest help to Thy supporter, but of
visible harm to Thy enemy”; Y. 43.4 also refers to “the recompenses
that Thou wilt give, through the heat of the truth-strong fire to the
wicked man and the just when retribution comes for these sinners.”
There are also references to the savior or saošyant (named
Astvat.ərəta, q.v.): Y. 30.8-9 refers to those “who shall deliver the Lie



into the hands of Truth. And then may we be those who shall
transfigure this world (fraša).” Elsewhere Zoroaster refers to the
saošyants who “have been appointed opponents of Fury” (Aēšma,
q.v.; Y. 48.12). Whether these allusions indicate the prophetic origin
of the whole schema—for example, a belief in the resurrection—has
been doubted by some. The oldest extant text to make explicit
reference to details of frašō.kərəti is Yt. 19, where veneration is paid
to the xwarrah which will accompany the “Victorious one among the
Saviors, and also his other companions, so that he will make life
excellent (fraša), ageless, without decay, not rotting, not putrefying,
living forever, thriving forever, ruling as it wishes. When the dead will
rise, (then) will come the one without decay reviving the dead and
life will create excellent things according to its own wish. The world
of Truth will be undecaying, from generation to generation.
Falsehood will be returned to the place where it had come from” (st.
88-90, tr. Hintze, 1994b, p. 38; see also st. 10-12, 19-20, 22-24; st.
92 and 95 refer to the final Saošyant by name (see further Hintze,
1994a, pp. 103-28, 371-72).
A ‘traditionalʼ Zoroastrian account of the renovation is in DD 35-38.
The two texts with the most details and utilized ancient materials are
G.Bd. 33-34, with the most details on Saošyant and the resurrection,
and the Zand ī Wahman Yasn (hereafter ZWY; Anklesaria, 1957, pp.
279-93), which is most detailed on signs of the first saoš-yantʼs
coming. (Dk. VII, chaps. 8-11, has a full account but is available only
in West, 1895. See also Pahlavi Rivāyat 48; Williams, II, pp. 79-88.
For details, see Boyce, 1975, pp. 242-46, 281-93; Hinnells, 1971, pp.
68-70; Lommel, 1930, pp. 205-36; Zaehner, 1961, pp. 308-21.)
There are several divisions of the final three thousand years of world
history. One divided the era into four ages—each symbolized by a
metal, respectively gold, silver, steel, and iron; the last represents the
post-Sasanian age, when religion was declining (ZWY 1-3). The



period of iron is divided into three ages, each of a thousand years.
Each millennium follows a similar pattern: an initial period in which
evil forces assault the good creation with renewed vigor is followed
by theirrepulse prior to the coming of the next saošyant, when a
portion of the evil creation disappears. The victory over evil is not,
therefore, a sudden event in Zoroastrianism but a protracted war, in
which each side surges and falls back. Three- or seven-fold
numerical patterns are common in Zoroastrian mythology.
In the first of these eras demons of the race of Aēšma, Fury, will
assault Iran from the east, destroying homes, villages, and sacred
fires; social life will be disrupted;affection between fathers and sons
or between mothers and daughters will depart, and respect for truth
will decline, so that a bird will have more reverence than a religious
Iranian person. The chaos will also be cosmic; the sun and moon will
not give their proper light; rain will not come at the due times;
earthquakes, droughts, and famine will afflict creation. Rule will pass
from Iranians to Arabs. Life will appear so horrible that, when all was
revealed to Zoroaster, he prayed he might not live at this time. But a
shower of stars will appear in the sky, and a righteous prince,
Vahrām Varzāvand, also “the illustrious Pešōtan” (son of Zoroasterʼs
patron, Vištāsp), accompanied by the three great fires, will come;
they will overthrow the forces of evil and restore Iran and its throne
for the Good Religion; then Ōšēdar will appear.
The first saošyant, like his two successors, will be born of a virgin
who has been impregnated by Zoroasterʼs seed preserved in a lake
in which she will bathe. When he reaches the age of thirty, the sun
will stand still at the noonday position, as it had at the initial creation,
for ten days and nights. He will confer with the Aməṧa Speṇtas and
bring afresh the revelation first brought by Zoroaster. The Good
Creation will return to a condition nearer the ideal state; people will
live more harmoniously, and part of the evil creation, the wolf



species, will disappear. But although the end of evil is approaching,
in its death throes it will again hurl its forces against the divine
creation. Some texts say enemies of Iran will attack and suppress the
good religion, but this is probably a historicizing of the prophecy, for
others say that a terrible winter, the winter of Malkūs, will afflict the
world and destroy much of mankind. But good will again triumph, for
the world will be repeopled from Yimaʼs Vara, and on this
repopulated earth disease will not prove fatal, death will only happen
through old age or murder; so Evilʼs greatest weapon, death, will
begin to lose its power.
Then the second savior, Ōšēdarmah, will be born, at whose arrival
the sun will stand still at the noonday position for twenty days, not
just ten as before, and creation will flourish for six years, not just
three. More evil creatures such as the snake will disappear. The ideal
state of the original creation will begin to return, so people will cease
eating meat and consume only vegetables andwater. But there will
again be an evil onslaught, as Aži Dahāka escapes from his mountain
prison, perpetrating sin, devouring one third of humanity and
animals, and smiting the sacred elements of fire, water, and
vegetation. But the hero Keresāsp will be resurrected, and he will rid
the world of this evil force, so that again good will be in the
ascendancy before the birth of the third and final saošyant—once
more from the prophetʼs seed preserved in a lake.
With the birth of the saošyant, more of the paradisal state will return:
disease, death, and persecution will disappear; vegetation will
flourish perpetually, and people will eat only spiritual food. He will
raise the dead from where they died; everyone will proceed to their
final judgement, this time in the body. Following this second
judgement people will proceed to heaven or hell for three days and
nights to be rewarded or punished in the body, so the whole person
is corrected; thus all can dwell in perfection with Ohrmazd. (Some



texts imply some sinners will not be thus purged.) First, all will pass
through a stream of molten metal, which will already have leveled the
earth as it had been before evilʼs assault. It will seem like warm milk
to the righteous but painful to the wicked; thus refined and purified
people will receive the gift of immortality from Saošyantʼs priestly
sacrifice of the final animal to die in the service of humanity. From
the fat of the ox and the mythical White Haoma in the cosmic ocean
will come the elixir of immortality. The heavenly beings and evil
forces will pair off in conflict until all evil beings are eradicated. The
molten metal will flow into hell, destroying it and its stench. The
world will exist for eternity in the perfect state which Ohrmazd had
desired from the beginning. Accounts differ concerning Ahrimanʼs
fate, some say he will be slain, others that he will be eternally
imprisoned and impotent.
Many scholars believe that Zoroastrian myths regarding angels,
demons, heaven, hell, resurrection, and judgement of the dead and
apocalyptic eschatology had significant influence on Jewish and
Christian thought (Hinnells, 2000, pp. 29-92).
Myth and ritual. In the early twentieth century, scholars of religion
formed the “Myth and Ritual School.” A notable proponent was S. H.
Hooke, who wrote on Babylonian religion. One part of their theory
was that myth represented the written part of ritual, or ritual was the
acting out of the myth. Neither this, nor other parts of their theories,
is implied by this heading. Although they pressed some theories too
far, there is nevertheless an intimate link between myth and ritual.
Myths commonly legitimate traditional social, cultural, and religious
practices, as noted above. Another important aspect of ritual is that
it activates spiritual power. There are several examples of this
interplay between myth and ritual in Iranian sources. This section will
look at three to illustrate a general point: Haoma; Nasu, the corpse
demon; and Ātar, fire.



Haoma (q.v.; Pahl. Hōm, see Boyce, 1970 and 1975, pp. 156-62) is
the Iranian form, while Soma was the corresponding Indian
preservation of ancient Indo-Iranian tradition. Scholars have used
Vedic material to understand the Iranian figure, because the latter is
less clear. This may be mistaken, because scholars later argued that,
contrary to earlier assumptions, it is often the Iranian material which
preserves the more ancient picture (Benveniste and Renou). Haoma
is at once a divine power, a heavenly high priest, and a plant which is
pressed in the earthly ritual, the Yasna. Some have argued that
Zoroaster repudiated Haoma (Y. 48.10), but others, e.g., Boyce, have
argued that Haoma is represented in the Gāthās by Amərətāt (Pahl.
Amurdād, q.v.). Others have suggested the prophet did not condemn
Haoma, but its abuse. It is implausible that the prophetʼs immediate
followers would have perpetuated a tradition that the prophet had
roundly condemned. Solutions two and three, therefore, are more
plausible.
The main text on Haoma is Y. 9-11 (see HŌM YAŠT). It forms part of
the Yasna ceremony, which is why it is not included among the Yašts.
Y. 9-11 describes the plant as having a yellow stalk and growing in
the high mountains. The first four men to press Haoma were given
the boon of a noble son—including the fathers of Yima and
Zoroaster (Y. 9.2-15). Haoma is described as the one who keeps
death away, is curative, beneficent, and victorious, so Zoroaster is
depicted calling down his “intoxicating power, strength,
victoriousness so that he overcomes the hostilities of all of those
who are hostile” (Y. 9.16-19; Malandra, p. 153). Haoma aids women
in childbirth, grants knowledge to those reading the nasks, and is
asked to carry away enemiesʼ violence, “the jaundiced, dreadful,
poison-spitting snake, the bloodthirsty bandit and the whore
enchantress” (Y. 9.28-32). Haoma intoxicates, not with Wrath like
other intoxicants, but “isaccompanied by gladdening Truth” (Y. 10.8).



Haoma, as heavenly priest, should be offered portions of the jaw,
tongue, and left eye of each sacrificial animal so he might care for its
soul. The earthly consecrated Haoma represents the mythical White
Hom in the cosmic ocean which will be offered at the renovation (see
above). It was the heavenly Haoma who performed as zaotar for
Ahura Mazdā and the Aməṧa Speṇtas. He is the yazata of plants
(hence the suggested link with Amərətāt). Here is a stark contrast
with much Western mythology: an earthly plant representing a
profoundly abstract concept of a priestly heavenly being. Zaehnerʼs
use of the Christian term “sacrament” to describe the rite is entirely
inappropriate (1961, p. 90). The Yasna continues to be a major ritual
(Modi, pp. 246-310).
Purity and impurity. There is a complex web of myths associated
with purity and impurity (Boyce, 1977, pp. 92-138; 1975, pp. 294
330, and see under CLEANSING i). As at creation, Ahriman attacks
the world “like a fly” spreading darkness and noxious creatures. The
corpse demon, Nasu, is also depicted as a fly and descends on a
corpse from the north soon after death (Vd 7.2-4). Nasu is destroyed
by the gaze of a dog (Šāyast nē šāyast 2.1-4), by the recitation of the
names of the Ameṧa Speṇtas (Yt. 4.2-3, 8), or by the barašnom (q.v.,
and see Vd. 7). There is also a strong doctrine concerning animals.
The beneficial creatures, especially cattle (q.v.) and the dog (q.v.),
are fellow workers (hamkārs) with humanity in the fight against evil.
The cow is respected, because it provides food, milk, clothing, and
fuel (its dung). Cattle are vegetarian, giving of themselves for others.
The dog embodies the Zoroastrian virtues of obedience, loyalty, and
affection; it also protects people—both in ancient times on the Asian
steppes and at death—for a dog is brought to see the corpse partly
to protect people from the surrounding evil forces and because it
detects any life. All beneficient creatures were created by Ohrmazd
for a purpose—for example, the vulture to devour dead matter (G.Bd.



24.36).
Opposed to the beneficent creatures are the xrafstras, vile and
venomous creatures who cause death. There are three categories:
watery, earthy, and winged; but they are similar in their deadly,
polluting work. They include snakes and scorpions, the lion and the
wolf species, the ant, locusts, and the ugly frog. Ahriman intended to
produce these forces clandestinely, but Ohrmazd made them visible,
so that people could avoid, indeed kill, them (G. Bd. 22-23).
Because death involves the powerful presence of evil, detailed
prescriptions determine funerals and contacts with a corpse (q.v.;
see also DEATH; Modi, pp. 49-82). During the funeral the corpseʼs
head should not point northwards, the home of Nasu; special prayers
are offered by the bereaved to Sraoša, the soulʼs guardian, during its
three-day meditation on its life; and after the third night, when it
proceeds to judgement, other prayers are offered to the yazatas of
judgement, namely Mithra, Sraoša, and Rašnu.
The sacred fire. Fire (ātar) is the focus of all Zoroastrian ritual.
Naturally there is a web of mythology surrounding offerings to the
fire (ātaš zōhr, q.v.). Fire protected nomads at night from attack by
wolves and other animals; it cooked food; it provided warmth in the
fiercely cold nights on the Iranian plateau; the ordeal by fire took
various forms in ancient Iran (molten metal on the chest of the
person being tested, or the accused passed between walls of fire to
prove divine protection for the righteous) and is part of the
judgement at the renovation, as noted above. The idea of the inner
fire of the life force, and cold associated with death, was also a
feature of ancient thought. Fire was an important part of Indo-Iranian
thought as evidenced by ātar, also by Vedic Agni; indeed Greek and
Roman thought suggest it was part of Indo-European mythology.
There are two characteristic Zoroastrian elements. The first is the



ritual fire; all rites are performed in the presence of fire, either in a
temple or before the sun. The second is the connection with the
Ameša Speṇta, Aša (q.v). As early as the Yasna Hap-taŋhāiti fire is
spoken of as the son of Ahura Mazdā (Y. 36.2). There are many texts
concerning fire, notably Y. 62.1-10 and the ancient Litany to the Fire,
the Ātaš Niyāyišn (q.v., and see Dhalla, 1965, pp. 134-87), recited
before the ritual fire from ancient to modern times. There “the son of
Ahura Mazdā” (st. 4 and 14) is described as “the holy, bold, good
warrior,” as “full of glory, full of healing” (st. 6). Stanzas 6 and 7
depict the ritual offering to fire: “In the dwellings of men Happiness
may there be unto that man, Who shall sacrifice unto Thee, With
fuel, with the Barsom, With milk, with the mortar in his hand. (7)
Mayest thou be provided with proper fuel! incense! [and] with proper
nourishment! ... with proper up-keep! Mayest thou be maintained by
one full of age! by one wise [in Religion], O Fire, son of Ahura
Mazdā.” Later the petitioner prays “Give unto me, O Fire, son of
Ahura Mazdā! ... well-being ... Sustenance, life in abundance,
knowledge, holiness, a ready tongue, understanding for [my] soul;
and afterwards wisdom” (st. 10). The fire gives blessings of cattle, an
active spirit, and a joyous life (st. 16). With Vohumanah, Ātar
protected the creation from the assault of Angra Mainyu (Yt. 13.77;
Dk. III, 112Ñ5). Ātār also fought with Aži Dahāka to protect the
xwarrah (Yt. 19.46-50).
There are three grades of ritual fire: the ātaš Bahrām involves the
purification and unification of sixteen fires, the total consecration
taking a year; the ātaš Adorān unites the fires associated with the
four social classes— priests, warriors, farmers, and artisans—and is
the grade which burns in most modern temples. These two grades
can only be tended by a priest. The third grade, the dādgāh, involves
a simple consecration and can be burned in the home and tended by
lay people (Boyce, 1977, pp. 68-91; Modi, pp. 199-230).



The mythical imagery is mostly associated with ātaš Bahrāms, the
victorious, kingly fires which battle against the powers of darkness
and are “enthroned” in a temple (of which there are only twelve in
the world), with the wood being laid in the shape of a throne. When
installed, it is said to be so powerful it can kill a thousand demons
(Pahlavi Vd. 8.80). There were three great historical ātaš Bahrāms in
ancient Iran; each was projected into the realm of mythology (related
in G.Bd. 18.8-14). All are said to have existed from creation, and each
moved freely, protecting the world (st. 8). They aided Yima during his
glorious reign and will aid mighty Pešotan, who will come at the
renovation to destroy evil. The best known is ādur Gušnasp (q.v.), a
focus of royal pilgrimage and gifts in Sasanian times, when it was
moved to Taḵt-e Solaymān in Azerbaijan. The second major fire in
Sasanian times, ādur Farnbāg (q.v.) in Pārs, was associated with the
priests. When Yima was sawn in two, ādur Farnbāg saved his
xwarrah from Aži Dahāka (st. 10). The third great fire, ādur Burzēn
Mihr (q.v.), was associated with the lowest of the three social
classes, husbandmen. It was probably a focus of particular
veneration; for it, along with Vohumanah and Aṧa, is believed to have
accompanied king Vištāspaʼs spirit on its journey to see his place in
heaven when he accepted the religion of Zoroaster (st. 14; see
GOŠTĀSP). These myths determine much Zoroastrian devotion. In
prayers fire is addressed as a being; standing before the
consecrated fire, one stands in the presence of the divine,
necessitating personal purity. Specific ritual sites, even the pattern
for laying sandalwood in a fire, is legitimated by myth.
Myth and the prophet. Most religions which believe in a prophetic or
founder figure have a complex web of myths about that figure, be
that Gautama the Buddha or Jesus the Christ. These are different
from hero myths, because in relating the founding of the religion
they indicate how the religion itself is understood—for example as a



means of overcoming the ultimate bonds whichensnare people, such
as ignorance, rebirth, or sin. What matters is not whether the myths
are literally true, but their role as charters directing their followersʼ
lives. To describe something as a myth about the prophet does not
imply the prophet was a myth; it indicates a web of interpretation of
the prophetʼs person and work. There is therefore no suggestion that
the prophet did not live a historical life, be that Jesus or Zoroaster.
The myths associated with Zoroaster/Zarathuštra are fundamentally
about how in the divine plan good triumphs in its battle with evil
(Jackson; Mole, 1963; Boyce, 1975, pp. 277-93; Hinnells, 1971, pp.
92-97). Zoroaster believed he was part of part of Ahura Mazdāʼs
plan, asserting he had been called and set apart “from the
beginning” (Y. 44.11). He was convinced Ahura Mazdā had appeared
and spoken to him in visions (Y. 45.5-6), that he hadchosen and
aided him (Y. 46.3; 50.5). He described himself as a savior (saošyant)
who suppressed Aēšma (Y. 48. 9 and 12), as a physician of the soul
(Y. 31.19), and the soul-healing judge (Y. 31Ñ2, 44.16). He
accompanies the righteous over the bridge of judgement (Y. 46.10).
The major Pahlavi texts were collected in West, 1897 and Molé, 1967
(see also Molé, 1963, pp. 271-386, 469-525, and Boyce, 1975, pp.
277-81). The main texts are: Dk. VII, Dk. V; Pahlavi Rivāyat 47 and
Vičirkay-i-dēnīk (the latter two only in Molé, 1967), and in parts of
Zādsparam (only in West, 1897). There is also the 13th-century
Zartušt-nāma, based on the earlier texts (Rosenberg). Zoroaster and
his patron also appear in the Šāh-nāma. Further, Zoroaster aroused
interest among ancient Western writers (Bidez-Cumont, I chaps. 1-3
and II, part 1; de Jong, pp. 317-23). His fame is reflected in the
considerable body of material attributed to him pseudonymously by
ancient Western writers (Beck, 1991). It was asserted by many in the
Roman empire that the cult of Mithras was created by Zoroaster,
though some modern commentators question this (Beck, 1984;



Hinnells, 1994, pp. 11-17).
In the following, emphasis is on the theological implications of the
myths. Later mythology related that Zoroasterʼs coming had been
foretold to the first created ox and to Yima. For Zoroastrians,
Zoroaster was not a historical accident; he was part of the divine
plan for the conquest of evil. By his teaching humanity the true
nature of good and evil, it was (and is) believed, people will
eventually reject evil and fight for good. His birth marked the
introduction of the last of four great eras of history—the time when
evil will be defeated. Zoroasterʼs xwarrah, his fravaši, and body (tan
gohr) passed from the heavens into the body of a young girl,
Dughdov, while she was in her motherʼs womb. At her birth she
radiated light, and the demons spread the idea she was a sorceress,
so herfather sent her away. But she met, and married, Pou-rušasp.
The glory, the spirit, and the body of the prophet were thus
conveyed from heaven to earth through his mother. Zoroaster was
not divine, but he was divinely sent. The Good Creation rejoiced at
his birth, and the demons trembled, for they knew that Zoroaster
could smite them. He was the only person ever to laugh at birth
appropriately in a religion which considers misery anaffliction from
evil—and a light shone around his home. Recognizing his threat to
them, evil forces repeatedly sought to kill him; they deluded his
father into thinking that the light signified he was evil. First he laid his
son on firewood and tried to light it, but could not. Then he placed
the baby in front of stampeding oxen, but the leading ox stood
protectively over him; a similar episode followed with horses. The
infant was put in the lair of a she-wolf with the thought that she
would attack him; instead she protected him. Evil always seeks to
destroy good, but even the most deadly assaults fail with Ohrmazdʼs
protection. There are stories illustrating the compassion and wisdom
of the young prophet and his resolve in his battle with evil. On one



occasion a priest entered his home who worshipped false gods, for
which the child admonished him. The priest condemned him, but
was struck dead as he left the house. Evil should be opposed
wherever it is found, and good will triumph over evil.
Zoroaster was a priest and spent time meditating, until one day a
transcendent figure came and led him into the presence of angels,
where he was instructed in the Good Religion—the first of his eight
visions. He revealed the divine Truth to people on earth because of
his experience of heavenly forces. When the revelation was
complete, the demons again sought to lead him astray, but in vain.
He continued firm in his prayers and worship, thus being the true
guide for his followers in the trials that beset them. At first his
teaching was rejected, but after convincing a few people he went to
king Vištāspʼs palace. The courtʼs learned men disputed with him for
three days; but, seeing Zoroaster beginning to convince the monarch
and fearing for their established position, they plotted against him.
He was thrown into prison for necromancy. Then a miracle occurred:
the kingʼs favorite horse grew ill, and its legs drew into its body so it
could not move. Zoroaster offered to heal the horse on four
conditions: the king should accept Zoroasterʼs religion; the warrior
prince should fight for the religion; the queen shouldaccept the
religion, and, finally, the plottersʼ identities should be revealed. As
each condition was agreed one of the horseʼs legs was restored until
it was fully healthy again. Resolute commitment to the religion
overcomes any problem. As Vištāsp accepted the religion, three
archangels appeared at court, promising that the protective
presence of Ahura Mazdā would ensure victory over their enemies.
With the conversion of the court, the march of the religion through
history began. Zoroaster went forth and made the demons, who
formerly had roamed about in human form, go into underground
concealment (Y. 9.15). The Good Religion overcomes the powers of



evil.
The myths associated with Zoroaster circulated beyond the
boundaries of Iran, and were repeated, mostly in garbled form,
sometimes (e.g., Clementineʼs Recognitions) gravely misrepresenting
him to bring the religion into disrepute. He was, for example,
identified with Ham, the son of Noah, and was said to conjure up the
stars until a presiding genie, angry at his control, destroyed “the arch
magician” with fire from heaven. The first part of his name, “Zoro”
was interpreted as Greek for “living,” and the ‘aster” with the word
for star, thus portraying him as “the living star,” i.e., an astrologer (de
Jong, 1997). But for Zoroastrians through the millenia, the example
set, the revelation brought, by the divinely guided and protected
prophet inspires devotion, provides the ultimate role model,
reassures them in their fight against evil, and supports them in their
woes. Most Zoroastrian homes proudly display an image of their
glorious prophet in traditional priestly dress; he is a real presence in
their daily lives.
Myth and sacred geography. It is natural that in a religion which
emphasizes that the physical world is the creation of God there
should be the idea of sacred geography. The land of Iran (Ērānwēz,
q.v.), the land of the Aryans, is central to much mythology from
creation to the renovation. The Old Persian Ahuramazdā is “god of
the Aryans.” Mithra surveys the whole land inhabited by Iranians (Yt.
10.13) and bestows peaceful and comfortable dwellings in Iranian
countries (Yt. 10.4). It is where the first human and ox dwelt; Yima
built his Vara there, andPersepolis is known as Taḵt-e Jamšid,
Jamšidʼs throne; it is where the mythic Mt. Harā and the start of the
Činvat bridge are located, where the prophet lived, and where Aži
Dakāka is imprisoned (Gnoli, 1989, esp. pp. 29-70; G.Bd. 32-33). In
the Vd. Ahura Mazdā tells the prophet he created it “the first and
best of places.” Yt. 19 refers to the “xwarrah which belongs to Iran”



(st. 57, 60, 62, 63, 64). In modern Iran there are myths and legends
associated with holy places, shrines, and fires (Boyce, 1967). It is the
abode of the secret race of Zoroastrian giants in the Parsi movement
Ilm-i Khshnoom, started by Behramshah Shroff (q.v.) in the early
twentieth century. So the land of Iran is seen as a unique, sacralized
space, where some of the great mythological and theological
moments of history have been enacted.
Myth and society. It is natural that myths reflect the structure of the
society in which they evolved. G. Dumezil propounded a theory
which has ardent supporters, and virulent opponents.
Fundamentally, he argued that Indo-European mythology
distinguished three strata of society representing three ‘functionsʼ:
religious and juridical sovereignty, warriors concerned with physical
prowess, and the productive workers (herder-cultivators). He argued
that the deities of Indo-Europeans were ordered in this tripartite
manner (Duchesne-Guillemin, Littleton). Many scholars have
disputed this theory, especially in explaining details of the gods and
their activities—for example, Mit(h)ra (Dumezil, 1976; Thieme and
Gonda in Hinnells, 1975). Many thought he saw parallels where none
existed. But his broad point that patterns of mythology reflect social
patterns has much to commend it. It is inevitable that myths reflect
the society which generates them; for example, the warrior imagery
associated with Mithra reflects the martial practices of ancient Iran,
as the mythical symbolism of the ox reflects their life as herdsmen.
The Zoroastrian practice of praying before the divine creations,
especially fire and water, rather than in temples similarly reflects
their nomadic life. The various roles of fire in Zoroastrian mythology
reflect its diverse functions in ancient society—from life-protecting
warmth to the judicial process. Myths are powerful precisely
because they reflect the society and its values in which they are
embedded. It follows that the study of mythology is important for the



understanding of a society, especially its ideals, fears, and motives.
Theology and Iranian mythology. A characteristic feature of Iranian
mythology is the lack of narrative. Compared with Greek, Roman, or
Indian myths there are few stories about divine or demonic beings.
The figure of Mithra is a good example. He rides in his chariot before
the sun, he is depicted in warrior form, but his theological role is
fundamentally abstract, as Contract or covenant (Gershevitch,
1970). The imagery illustrates key beliefs, but it does not involve a
narrative. This is true of many figures considered in this article e.g.,
Haoma and xwarrah. There is a narrative concerning the conflict of
good and evil, but little concerning the ‘playersʼ in that drama. The
Aməṧa Speṇtas are described in terms of their functions. Even in
Pahlavi literature, where they are said to sit on thrones, they remain
facets of the divinenature, and their abstract ‘namesʼ (Good Mind,
Truth, Devotion, etc.) are different from the Judeo-Christian concept
of the archangels, who have personal names.Although abstract
conceptions, they are also powerful spiritual forces ‘reallyʼ present in
the ritual as the priest, offering his prayers with mindful devotion in a
pure setting, gazes at the physical creations which each protects
and in which they are represented (milk, fire, earth, water, etc.), so
they become powerfully present (Kotwal, pp. 35-44). Their abstract
nature does not mean they are remote forces.
Herodotus commented on the abstract nature of Iranian mythology
based on his own experience:
The erection of statues, temples, and altars is not anaccepted
practice among them, and anyone who does such a thing is
considered a fool, because, presumably the Persian religion is not
anthropomorphic like the Greek. Zeus, in their system, is the whole
circle of the heavens, and they sacrifice to him from the tops of
mountains. They also worship the sun, moon, and earth, fire water



and winds, which are their only deities. (Histories I, pp. 130-31)
The myths are clearly structured. The events depicted at creation
and at frašō.kərəti follow a pattern. As the earth shook at Ahrimanʼs
initial assault, causing mountains to be thrown up, valleys opened,
dislodging the sun and moon from their fixed, midday position, so
these events are mirrored at the renovation. The signs of the
approach of frašō.kərəti include earthquakes, the sun and moon
standing still for a fixed period as each of the three saošyants is
born, and at the renovation the molten metal reduces the hills and
fills the valleys, returning the earth to its original level condition. Just
as humans originally neither ate nor drank but gradually began to do
so, similarly at the renovation people will progressively stop eating
meat, drinking milk, and eating vegetables. As chaos assaulted
existence at creation, so among evilʼs final assaults there will be both
cosmic and social chaos. The climax will be the restoration of order
as in Ohrmazdʼs original creation. Unlike many branches of Indian
thought, Iranian mythologhas a linear concept of time—a beginning,
middle, and end; nevertheless there is an element of a cyclical
pattern as events at the renovation mirror events at creation.
There is also much logic in the theology of the mythology. The first
judgement is in the mēnōg realm, for the physical body visibly
remains on earth, hence the theological necessity of the resurrection
so that people can be judged in the gētīg body, for both are the
creations of Ohrmazd (Shaked, chap. II). It provides a rational answer
to the problem “why do the innocent (e.g., babies) suffer while evil
flourishes?” For Zoroastrians, it is illogical to suggest that God can
be both all-loving and all-powerful.
It is necessary to define what constitutes Good and Evil in
Zoroastrianism. The Good is that which is conducive to life, order,
and peace; whatever is in a pure state and not subject to the



pollution of evil, i.e., which is in the state in which Ohrmazd created
it. It is where mēnōg and gētīg are held in balance. Good thoughts,
words, and deeds are those which are true and consistent with
thedivine plan for creation, embodying valor, fortitude, benevolence;
it is moderation, or the Mean—the midpoint between opposing vices.
The good life is one of obedience and devotion towards Ohrmazd
and care for his creations.
In contrast, evil is that which is destructive of harmony and order;
that which is polluted (i.e., anything associated with death and
decay); the chaotic—it is anything to excess or in a state of
deficiency. Evil is expressed through violence and anger. Evil actions
are those which harm or pollute the divine creation; spreading
falsehood rather than truth, idleness, greed, fury, and arrogance.
The myths embody basic Zoroastrian understandings of human
nature and duty. The good person will expel the demons from within
themselves and make their bodies the dwelling place of the divine
beings. “It is possible to put Ahriman out of this world in such a way
that every person, for his own part, should chase him out of his body,
for Ahrimanʼs habitation in the world is in the bodies of men.
Therefore when there is no habitation for him in the bodies of men,
he is annihilated from the whole world. For as long as in this world
(even) a small demon has his dwelling in a single person of men,
Ahriman is in the world” (Shaked, chap. III, p. 230, on Dk. VI.264).
Ohrmazd created humans to be his fellow workers (hamkārs) in the
fight against evil.
There are several analyses of human nature. The most traditional
one divides humans into five constituent parts (Bailey, pp. 78-119):
the body which dies at death but is resurrected; the soul which is
judged after death; vital spirit (the principle of life); consciousness
(which dissolves at death); and the fravaši which forever dwells with



Ohrmazd on high. The good person keeps the different parts of their
being in their natural balance, but Ahriman constantly seeks to
disrupt them.
The first human couple, as noted above, grew out of two leaves of a
plant, which itself had grown from Gayōmardʼs sperm. Two major
theological themes devolve from this myth. (1) In Judaism and
Christianity the first woman, Eve, was carved from the rib of Adam,
and consequently women were seen as theologically derivative or
secondary in gender relations. In Zoroastrianism the genders
emerged simultaneously and independently from the same plant.
Here, as in Zoroastrianism generally, there is gender equality, e.g.,
regarding initiation, prayer, funerals. The sole difference relates to
purity laws and menstruation. Anything leaving the body is dead
matter—spittle, breath, urine, or blood. Blood while in the body is
living; when it leaves the body it is dead matter and therefore
polluting, be that a cut from a hand (manʼs or womanʼs) or
menstruation. Dead matter is the presence of evil, hence a locus of
pollution, which must not be brought into the presence of the holy,
e.g., fire. The religious and social role of women during menstruation
is therefore strictly regulated. She is not sinful, rather the hapless
victim of evil. As Ahriman sought to destroy life at creation, so he
attacks the place where life is generated—the womanʼs body.
Precisely because she plays a major role in the generation of life, a
woman is a target for evil. It would be sinful to bring pollution into the
presence of the sacred, but she is not sinful because of the pollution.
(2) Because humans emerged from a plant, there is a natural unity
between humanity and the plant world. As fire, water, and other
creations are the work of Ohrmazd, humans have a religious duty to
protect and respect them; to abuse them is sinful. In his vision of
heaven the Righteous Virāz saw shepherds and agriculturalists
stationed in one of the highest heavens. Modern Zoroastrians



commonly assert theirs is the first environmentally aware religion.
Humans have a religious duty to procreate in order to increase
Ohrmazdʼs army, though impotence is an affliction of evil, not a sin;
choosing not to have children is sinful, as are celibacy and misery,
because all fail to value the Good Creation. The material world is not
opposed to the spiritual world, as it is inHellenism; the physical is the
manifestation, almost the fulfillment, of the spiritual, with which it
should be in harmony. When Mani taught that the material world was
corrupt and evil, he was in conflict with a basic Zoroastrian ideal
(Shaked, chaps. II and III).
Political myths and legends. Myths and legends are commonly
associated with political authority. Three main Iranian sources relate
to this topic: (1) Achaemenid (q.v.) and Sasanian reliefs, inscriptions,
and artifacts; (2) royal legends, mostly Sasanian, some preserved in
Greek sources; (3) the epic literature, notably the Šāh-nāma and Vis
and Ramin.
On royal reliefs kings were consistently portrayed as of greater size
(and thereby power and status) than other humans. Ancient Iranian
artifacts such as cylinder seals (q.v.) depict the kings in combat with
mythical malign forces, as do reliefs on the door jambs of the throne
room at Persepolis, probably reflecting adaptations of the sacral
kingship common in the ancient Near East, especially Mesopotamia
(Hinnells, 1971, pp. 98-109 at p. 105; Eddy). We do not know
whether the tribute processions depicted at Persepolis reflect an
ideology similar to those of the annual Babylonian New Year Festival,
wherein the monarch re-enacted the myth of creation to revive
hissupernatural powers as the adopted son of God, but it seems
likely that the Achaemenids took something from both the
iconography and ideology of sacred kingship in the ancient Near
East. Clear iconographic evidence for the Achaemenid deployment
of sacral kingship is the relief of Darius at Bisotun (q.v.), which



closely follows a nearby royal relief of Anabanini from the third
millennium B.C.E., in the overall design of the relief, the gestures of
monarch and captives. Several Sasanian reliefs continued the theme.
For example, at Naqš-e Rostam Ardašir I is depicted receiving the
kingship from Ohrmazd. As Ohrmazd tramples Ahriman underfoot,
so the monarch—yet taller than Ohrmazd—tramples on the last
Parthian monarch, Ardavān, an explicit iconographic statement that
the king carries out the work of Ohrmazd on earth. The conquests
and policies of Iranian monarchs were therefore legitimated by
relating them in myths.
Some royal inscriptions support this hypothesis. The monarchs set
their regal authority in a mythological context, stressing they were
chosen, protected, and supported by Ahuramazdā (see the OPers.
texts, Kent, pp. 116-57). Rebellions are mythologically explained by
saying it was “the lie that made them [his opponents] rebellious” (DB
4.54). Darius proclaimed: “For this reason Ahuramazdā bore me aid,
and the other gods who are, because I was not hostile, I was not a lie
follower, I was not a doer of wrong. According to righteousness I
conducted myself “ (DB 4.63). Other inscriptions, by emphasizing
Ahuramaz-dā as creator, suggest he was a Zoroastrian: “A great god
is Ahuramazdā, who created this earth, who created yonder sky, who
created man, who created happiness for man, who made Darius
king” (DNa 7). His conception of wrath as an evil spirit similarly
appears Zoroastrian: “What is right, that is my desire. I am not a
friend to the man who is a Lie-follower. I am not hot-tempered. What
things develop in my anger, I hold firmly under control by my thinking
power. I am firmly ruling over my own (impulses)” (DNb 8b). At Susa
he asserted “A great god is Ahuramazdā, who makes excellence
(frašam) in this earth, who makes man in this earth, who makes
happiness for man” (DSs 6). Xerxes similarly located his rule within
mythology: “The man who has respect for that law which



Ahuramazdā has established, and worships Ahuramazdā and Arta
reverently, he both becomes happy while living and becomes
blessed when dead” (XPh 4d). In short, the themes of Ahuramazdā
as the creator of the world and happiness for humanity, making the
world fraša (the term used for one of the duties of Saošyant), the
demand for righteousness, and perception of evil as wrath and “the
lie” seem Zoroastrian. Scholarly opinion is divided on whether the
Achaemenid monarchs were Zoroastrians. But Zoroastrians or not,
the monarchs clearly contextualized their earthly rule in the mythical
cosmic battle between Truth and the lie and believed they were
chosen by Ahuramazdā.
There are various legends associated with the rise to power of the
Achaemenids and the Sasanians. There was significant Greek
interest in Cyrus (q.v.) and his establishment of the Persian empire.
The most widely quoted text is Herodotusʼs Histories (Book 1.108-41;
de Selincourt, 1954, pp. 57-71), others include Xenephonʼs
Cyropaedia (q.v.), and Ctesiasʼs (q.v.) Persika, especially books 7-11.
Herodotus (q.v.) was born in the early fifth century B.C.E. in Asia
Minor, so technically he lived under Persian rule, and presumably
heard the legend of Cyrusʼs birth from Persians (Frye, 1984 and
1976). Herodotusʼs story is complex. The basic theme is that Cyrus
was born of royal Median lineage; his mother Mandane was the
daughter of the monarch Astyages. But the king had a dream that a
vine grew from her genitals and spread over Asia, which the magi
interpreted to mean that her son would take over the throne. So
Astyages gave the baby to his trusted steward Harpagus with orders
to kill it, to the latterʼs distress. He passed the task to the kingʼs
shepherd, Mithradates, instructing him to expose the infant in a wild
place. When Mithradatesʼ wife heard of the order she suggested
keeping the baby but exposing their child born dead that day, and so
the babies were exchanged. The boy grew in strength, and while



playing “Kings” one day with others, he was chosen to be king. He
gave his subjects various tasks, but one refused and Cyrus ordered
his arrest. The others seized him, and Cyrus whipped him savagely.
When Astyages heard of this, he guessed the child was really his
grandson and questioned Harpagus about the implementation of his
orders. Hearing the truth he suppressed his anger and announced a
feast to celebrate his grandchildʼs survival, to which Harpagus and
his son were invited. Prior to the banquet Astyages had Harpagusʼs
son killed and part of his flesh was roasted, the rest boiled and
served to Harpagus. Only when he had eaten did a servant bring a
platter bearing the remains of his head, hands, and feet, and
Harpagus realized his punishment. Astyages related events to the
magi; they advised him that, as Cyrus had now been king, his own
throne was safe. Cyrus was returned to his parents, who received
their apparently lost son joyfully. When the child grew up, he was
joined by the disenchanted Harpagus, and they raised an army and
defeated the Medes, though Cyrus spared the life of Astyages. The
important themes to note are the royal ancestry but his being raised
by peasants, specifically a shepherd; the significance of dreams,
indicating divine guidance or the power of fate; the eventual
recognition of his royal ancestry and assumption of power. The
structure of the legend has been seen as a part of Indo-European
tradition (Frye, 1976, pp. 117-21).
Another important legend to illustrate the Iranian concept of kingship
is the Kār-nāmag ī Ardāsīr ī Pāpakān, “the book of the deeds” of the
first Sasanian monarch, Ardašir I (q.v.). Ardašir claimed divine
support for his rebellion against his Parthian overlords
iconographically in the Naqš-e Rostam relief as discussed above,
also through political legend (Sanjana). Ardašir was born into the
family of a shepherd, Sāsān, but he descended from Darius III, the
last Achaemenid monarch. In a dream the governor of Pārs, Pāpak,



saw the sun shining from Sāsānʼs head, lighting the world. Another
night he saw Sāsān on a richly adorned white elephant with people
making obeisance before him. On a third night he saw the three
great fires Farnbāg, Gušnasp, and Burzēn-mihr (see above) burning
in the home of Sāsān. He sought guidance from those able to
interpret dreams, who advised him that either Sāsān or his offspring
would take the throne. Pāpak summoned Sāsān and enquired of his
descent. He elevated Sāsān and gave him his own daughter in
marriage. From this union Ardašir was born; and Pāpak, regarding
him as his own son, gave him a royal education. News of his prowess
reached the great king Ardavān, who summoned the youth to his
palace that he might associate with the royal princes. But, as he
outshone them with his skills, he aroused their jealousy, and they
turned their father against him. One of the kingʼs favorite maidens
fell in love with Ardašir and visited him each night when the king was
asleep. The monarch, yet unsuspecting, summoned astrologers to
advise him on the current political situation. They foretold the rise of
a new king who would kill many potentates and bring the world once
more under the sway of one sovereign (Sanjana, p. 11). One
astrologer declared that any male servant who left the court in the
next few days would ascend to the throne. The maiden heard what
was said and told Ar-dašir. The following night, taking jewels and
weapons, she and Ardašir rode to Pārs. On learning of their
disappearance, Ardavān, directed by the astrologers, led his army in
pursuit. Nearing Pārs he asked passers by if they had seen the riders
and was told “At the dawn of the day ... they passed like a violent
wind, and a very powerful eagle was running after them” (Sanjana, p.
16). The high priest said the eagle was “the Majesty of the Kayanian
sovereignty” so Ardavān soon gave up the chase. Heassembled a
fresh army to capture them, but Ardašir also raised an army and took
his stand against Ardavān. But “as the glory of the Kayanians was
with Ardašir,” he triumphed (Sanjana, p. 21). The text continues with



stories of his exploits, victories, and the birth of his descendents.
The significance of the legend is the claim that the Sasanians, unlike
the Parthians, were true descendents of the Achaemenids and were
therefore the legitimate rulers; the Sasanian rise to power was a
matter of fate, and followed directives given by the religious
authorities; it was written in the stars and revealed in dreams. The
legend is fundamentally political propaganda, just as the relief at
Naqš-e Rostam is. The location of the heavenly directed events is
the area of Pārs, and the southwest of Iran, where the Achaemenids
also came to power.
From these myths and legends a clear concept of kingship emerges.
Yima was the role model of the ideal king and prior to his fall doubled
the size of his kingdom. Even the wicked Zaḥḥāk accepted that the
king was bound to give justice to his subjects. The king might rank
alongside Ahuramazdā, but still he could lose the royal glory if he lied
by claiming to be creator. The kingʼs duty was to make the world
fraša as Ahuramazdā did cosmically. Kings were not divine by nature,
unlike in Egypt, nor were they the adopted son of God as in Babylon.
Iranian kings ruled at the behest of Ahuramazdā; their fate could be
revealed in dreams and was written in the stars. The image of the
king was of a warrior and a man of righteousness. Myths and
legends were powerful political propaganda, holding up before
monarch and people the ideals to which all should aspire. The fame
of the Iranian monarch, especially of Cyrus, was such that it spread
far and wide.
Zurvanite mythology. Thus far attention has beenfocused on
‘orthodoxʼ Zoroastrian sources and myths. However, external
accounts of Zoroastrianism present a different picture. Greek and
Christian accounts refer to the ultimate not as Ohrmazd but as
Zurwān. Similarly the Manicheans referred to the First Man as Ahura
Mazdā, whereas the Father of Greatness was Zurwān (Time).



Buddhists in Sogdia used Zurwān, not Ahura Mazdā, for the
equivalent of Brahma. The key texts have been collected and
translated by Zaehner (1955, pp. 419-51, with a revised account in
Zaehner, 1961). There are four main sources for the central myth of
Zurvanism: two Armenians, Eznik of Kolb and Elise Vardapet, and two
Syrians, Theodore bar Konai and Yohannan bar Penkaye. Two central
themes in Zurvanism were speculation on Time and a quest for the
ultimate One behind the twins of the Gāthās. Zurwān, Infinite Time,
was seen as thefather of the twin spirits of good and evil. The myth
is reconstructed as follows: Zurwān sacrificed for a thousand years
hoping for a son, Ohrmazd, who would create the cosmos, but after
so long doubts entered his mind, at which moment twins were
conceived within his hermaphrodite self. He vowed the first to enter
his presence would be ruler of the world. Ahriman immediately leapt
from the womb and presented his detestable self to his Father, who
then had to make him ruler of the world for the remaining 9,000
years of history. The second born, Ohrmazd, he made high priest,
the ultimate victor in the battle and ruler of the spiritual world. The
mythology, elaborated in the light of Indian and Greek philosophy,
resulted in a strong sense of fatalism—Time bounded all and
determined all actions.
Zaehner identified a number of ‘Zoroastrianʼ texts and themes
differing from orthodoxy which he put together, assuming they
together constituted a single phenomenon, Zurvanite theology
(1955, pp. 275-418). Key texts were parts of the G.Bd. (not the
Indian), Zādspram, DMx, parts of the Dd., and passages from the
Pahlavi Rivāyat. However, only a few passages identified Zur-wān as
a divinity, notably Vd. 19.29, referring to routes followed by the soul
after judgement as “the paths created by Zurwān.” Infinite Zurwān is
mentioned in Y. 72.10; Vd. 19.13 and 16, and two Zurwāns are
mentioned in Niyayišn 1.8 (Zaehner, 1955, p. 276). Scholars



havedebated the history of this ‘movementʼ. For Boyce, the Sasanian
era was mainly Zurvanite, whereas for Zaehner that was an era of
conflict between Zurvanism and Zoroastrianism. For Frye (1976, pp.
47-54), Zurvanism was a school of thought within Sasanian
orthopraxy. Others have argued that Zurvanism represents the
ancient religion of Iran, witnessed for example in some of the
Luristan bronzes (Ghirshman, pp. 51-52) against which Zoroaster
rebelled. I share Shakedʼs doubts whether Zurvanism was ever a
single doctrinal entity reflected in all ‘unorthodoxʼ Iranian texts
(Shaked, chap. V). External accounts of any religion must be treated
with caution. Do all variants of Zoroastrian teaching originate in a
single movement (an ‘ismʼ)? It is not clear, for example, why
misogyny should be associated with a figure of Time.
Folk legends. Zoroastrian theology may have identified wizards and
spells as opposites from the holy word (see above on creation), but it
is clear that in popularlegend they and associated ideas of magic,
charms, spells, and incantations, especially against the evil eye, were
widespread. This is illustrated in the narrative of Vis and Ramin. It
was probably the worldʼs first romantic novel, written probably in the
Parthian period. It tells of the love of the queen, Vis, for the
monarchʼs younger brother Ramin, of their passionate affair, and
unfaithfulness. The kingʼs reactions range from fury to forgiveness as
the lovers repeatedly repent. At one stage Ramin moves away and
marries another, but duly leaves her and returns to his true love. The
king eventually died while preparing for battle with his brother, when
a boar charged through the camp, killing him. Ramin and Vis became
husband and wife for eighty-three years. In this story Visʼ faithful and
forgiving nurse repeatedly prepares potions, utters spells against the
evil eye, and makes and deploys charms to aid her mistress in her far
from smooth love life. It is precisely the sort of narrative prominent in
minstrel ballads sung at court and public events; it is the material of



popular folklore.
Conclusion. Myths and legends are not mere fantasy, but rather
stories which reflect a cultureʼs deepest values and ideals; they
emerge from, yet shape, society; they are the foundations of ritual
and ideologies. It is sometimes convenient to distinguish between
myth and legends and to identify types of each, but both are
complex, and the function of either can change in usage. Iranian
myths and legends share features found in other cultures, but they
are also distinctive both in the value system they reflect and in the
level of abstraction. They are not mere stories but are sources of
power, both in liturgies and politics.
