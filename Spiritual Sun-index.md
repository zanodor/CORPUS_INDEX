Spiritual Sun
SPIRITUAL SUN
It is very
necessary to
be known
that there are
two suns,
one spiritual,
the other
natural; a
spiritual sun
for those
who are in
the spiritual
world, and a
natural sun for those who are in the natural world. Unless this is
known, nothing can be properly understood about creation and
about man, which are the subjects here to be treated of. Effects may,
it is true, be observed, but unless at the same time the causes of
effects are seen, effects can only appear as it were in the darkness
of night. [DLW107]
THE SUN OF THE SPIRITUAL WORLD IS NOT GOD, BUT IS A
PROCEEDING FROM THE DIVINE LOVE AND DIVINE WISDOM OF
GOD-MAN; SO ALSO ARE THE HEAT AND LIGHT FROM THAT SUN.
By that sun which is before the eyes of the angels, and from which
they have heat and light, is not meant the Lord Himself, but the first
proceeding from Him, which is the highest [degree] of spiritual heat.
The highest [degree] of spiritual heat is spiritual fire, which is Divine
Love and Divine Wisdom in their first correspondence. On this



account that sun appears fiery, and to the angels is fiery, but not to
men. Fire which is fire to men is not spiritual, but natural; and
between the two fires there is a difference like the difference
between what is alive and what is dead. Therefore the spiritual sun
by its heat vivifies spiritual beings and renews spiritual objects. The
natural sun does the same for natural beings and natural objects; yet
not from itself, but by means of an influx of spiritual heat, to which it
renders aid as a kind of substitute. [DLW93]
As this has been proved by means of the heavens and the angels, it
may seem a matter of too exalted wisdom; but the same is true of
men. Men, as to the interiors of their minds, are warmed and
illuminated by that same sun. They are warmed by its heat and
illuminated by its light in the measure in which they receive love and
wisdom from the Lord. The difference between angels and men is
that angels are under the spiritual sun only, but men are not only
under that sun, but also under the sun of this world; for menʼs bodies
can begin and continue to exist only under both suns; but not so the
bodies of angels, which are spiritual. [DLW112]
There are two suns through which all things were created by the
Lord, the sun of the spiritual world and the sun of the natural world.
All things were created by the Lord through the sun of the spiritual
world, but not through the sun of the natural world, since the latter is
far below the former; it is in middle distance; above it is the spiritual
world and below it is the natural world. This sun of the natural world
was created to render aid, as a kind of substitute; this aid will be
spoken of in what follows. [DLW153]
WITHOUT A DOUBLE SUN, ONE LIVING AND THE OTHER DEAD, NO
CREATION IS POSSIBLE.



The universe in general
is divided into two
worlds, the spiritual and
the natural. In the
spiritual world are angels
and spirits, in the natural
world men. In external
appearance these two
worlds are entirely alike,
so alike that they cannot
be distinguished; but as
to internal appearance
they are entirely unlike.
The men themselves in
the spiritual world, who
(as was said above) are
called angels and spirits,
are spiritual, and, being spiritual, they think spiritually and speak
spiritually. But the men of the natural world are natural, and therefore
think naturally and speak naturally; and spiritual thought and speech
have nothing in common with natural thought and speech. From this
it is plain that these two worlds, the spiritual and the natural, are
entirely distinct from each other, so that they can in no respect be
together. [DLW163]
And His face was as the sun shineth in His power, signifies the
Divine love and the Divine wisdom, which are Himself, and proceed
from Himself. That by "the face of Jehovah," or of the Lord, is meant
the Divine Himself in His Essence, which is the Divine love and the
Divine wisdom thus Himself, will be seen in the explanations below,
where mention is made of "the face of God." The same is signified by
"the sun shining in His power." That the Lord is seen as a sun in
heaven before the angels, and that it is His Divine love together with



His Divine wisdom, which so appear, may be seen in the work
concerning Heaven and Hell, published in London, 1758 (n. 116-225);
and in The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Love and Wisdom
(n. 83-172).
[2] It remains here only to be confirmed from the Word, that the
"sun," when mentioned in reference to the Lord, signifies His Divine
love, and at the same time His Divine wisdom; this may appear from
the following places:
In that day the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, it
shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days (Isa. 30c26).
"That day" is the advent of the Lord when the old church is
destroyed, and a new one is about to be established; "the light of the
moon" is faith from charity, and "the light of the sun" is intelligence
and wisdom from love, and thus from the Lord.
Thy sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy moon withdraw
itself; for Jehovah shall be an everlasting light (Isa. 60c20).
The sun which shall not set, is love and wisdom from the Lord.
The rock of Israel spake unto me, as the light of the morning when
the sun ariseth (2 Sam. 23c3-4).
The "rock of Israel" is the Lord:
His throne shall be as a sun (Ps. 89c36-37)
This is said of David; but by "David" is there meant the Lord.
They shall fear thee with the sun. In his days shall the just flourish,



and abundance of peace until there is no moon; the name of the Son
shall be before the sun; and all nations shall be blessed in Him (Ps.
72c5, 7, 17).
[3] This also is said of the Lord. Because the Lord appears as a sun
in heaven before the angels, therefore:
When He was transfigured, His face did shine as the sun, and His
raiment became as the light (Matt. 17c1-2).
And it is said of the strong angel who came down from heaven, that:
He was clothed with a cloud, and His face was as it were the sun
(Rev. 10c1);
and of the woman, that:
She was seen clothed with the sun (Rev. 12c1).
"The sun" in these passages also signifies love and wisdom from the
Lord; "the woman" is the church, which is called the New Jerusalem.
[4] Since, by "the sun," is meant the Lord as to love and wisdom, it is
evident what is signified by "the sun" in the following places:
Behold the fierce day of Jehovah cometh; the sun shall be darkened
in its rising, and the moon shall not make her light to shine; I will visit
upon the world its wickedness, and upon the impious their iniquity
(Isa. 13c9-11; see also Isa. 24c21, 23).
And when I shall have extinguished thee, I will cover the heavens,
and I will make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a
cloud, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine, and I will set
darkness upon thy land (Ezek. 32c7-8).



The day of Jehovah cometh, a day of darkness, the sun and the
moon shall not make their light to shine, and the stars have
withdrawn their splendor (Joel 2c10).
The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood,
before the great day of Jehovah cometh (Joel 2c31).
The day of Jehovah is near in the valley of decision. The sun and the
moon shall be darkened (Joel 3c14-15).
The fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten,
the third part of the stars, and the day shone not for a third part of it
(Rev. 8c12).
The sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as
blood (Rev. 6c12).
The sun was obscured by the smoke of the pit (Rev. 9c2).
In these passages by "sun" is not meant the sun of this world, but
the sun of the angelic heaven, which is the Divine love and the Divine
wisdom of the Lord; these are said to be "obscured," "darkened,"
"covered," and "blackened" when there are evils and falsities with
man.
[5] Hence it is evident, that similar things are meant by the Lord's
words, where He speaks of the consummation of the age, which is
the last time of the church:
Immediately after the affliction of those days shall the sun be
obscured, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall
fall from heaven (Matt. 24c29; Mark 13c24-25).
And in like manner in the following passages:
And the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall grow
black over them (Micah 3c5-6).



In that day I will cause the sun to set at noon, and I will darken the
earth in the day of light (Amos 8c9).
She that hath borne seven shall breathe out her soul; her sun is set
while it is yet day (Jer. 15c9).
This is said of the Jewish church, which was "to breathe out its soul,"
that is, would perish; "the sun shall set," signifies that there will be no
longer any love and charity.
[6] It is said in Joshua, that:
The sun stood still in Gibeon, and the moon in the valley of Ajalon
(Josh. 10c12-13).
This appears as if it was historical, but it is prophetic, being quoted
from the book of Jasher, which was a prophetic book; for it is said:
Is not this written in the book of Jasher? (Josh. 13).
The same book is also mentioned as prophetic by David (2 Sam. 1c17,
18); something similar is also said in Habakkuk:
The mountains were moved, the sun and moon stood in their seat
(Hab. 3c10-11).
Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon be withdrawn
(Isa. 60c20).
For to make the sun and moon stand still would be to destroy the
universe.



[7] Since the Lord as to
the Divine love and the
Divine wisdom is meant
by "the sun," therefore
the ancients in their holy
worship turned their face
to the rising of the sun;
and also their temples,
which custom still
continues. That the sun
of the world is not meant
in these places by "the
sun," is evident from its
having been considered
profane and abominable
to adore the sun and
moon of the world, as
may be seen in Num.
25c1-4; Deut. 4c19; 17c3,
5; Jer. 8c1, 2; 43c10, 13;
44c17-19, 25; Ezek. 8c16;
for by "the sun of the world" is meant the love of self and the pride of
one's own intelligence; and the love of self is diametrically opposite
to the Divine love; and the pride of one's own intelligence is opposite
to the Divine wisdom. To adore the sun of the world is also to
acknowledge nature as the creator, and one's own prudence to be
effective of all things, which involves the denial of God, and the
denial of the Divine providence. [AR 53]
I have been shown how the Lord as a sun appears to the angels of
the celestial kingdom in their first state, in their second state, and in
their third state. I saw the Lord as a sun, at first glowing and brilliant
with a splendor that cannot be described; and I was told that such is



the appearance of the Lord as a sun to the angels in their first state.
Afterwards there appeared a great obscure belt about the sun, and
by this its first glow and brilliancy, which gave it such splendor,
began to be dulled, and I was told that such is the appearance of the
sun to them in their second state. Then the belt seemed by degrees
to grow darker, and the sun to appear less glowing, and this by
degrees until at length it took on a shining whiteness; and I was told
that such is the appearance of the sun to them in their third state.
After this, that shining whiteness was seen to move to the left
towards the moon of heaven, and to add itself to her light; and in
consequence the moon shone forth with unwonted splendor; and I
was told that such is the fourth state of those in the celestial
kingdom and the first state of those in the spiritual kingdom, and that
in both kingdoms changes of state have such alternations; yet not in
the whole kingdom at once, but in one society after another.
Furthermore, I was told that these alternations are not fixed, but
come upon them sooner or later without their knowledge. And it was
added that the sun in itself is not thus changed or moved; but it
takes on this appearance in accord with their successive
progressions of state, since the Lord appears to everyone in accord
with what his state is, thus glowing when one is in intense love and
less glowing and finally shining white as his love subsides; and the
quality of each oneʼs state was represented by the obscure belt that
induced upon the sun these apparent variations in its glow and light.
