Molecular mechanisms that control circadian
rhythms were identified, resulting in a 2017 Nobel
Prize in Physiology
--Circadian rhythms are classic examples of consciousness, arousal or response of the neural system to external stimuli, e.g., sunlight
--Circadian rhythm is an example of consciousness demonstrated in reactions of neural correlates such as pineal gland and secretion of melatonin—aroused by the presence of sunlight

Jeffrey C. Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael W. Young got the 2017 Nobel Prize in
Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries of molecular mechanisms that control
circadian rhythms.
Heritability of circadian rhythms and clock genes With time, many relevant physiological
properties besides periodic leaf movements were found to be controlled by the physiological
clock and the inheritance of circadian rhythms began to be considered as the product of
natural selection.
Transcription Translation Feedback Loop (TTFL) --Self-sustained circadian TTFL represents a
new paradigm; this new paradigm resulted in the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or
Medicine.

Figure 1. An internal biological clock. Leaves of mimosa plants open towards the sun during
daytime and close at dusk. Jean Jacques d’Ortous de Mairan placed a mimosa plant in
constant dark and found that the leaves continued to follow their daily rhythm for several
days. This suggested that mimosa plants have a cell autonomous clock that can maintain the
biological rhythm even under constant conditions.

Figure 2. A simplified illustration of the feedback regulation of the period gene. A) Both period
mRNA and PER protein oscillate, with PER protein accumulating several hours after the peak in
period mRNA. PER protein localizes in the nucleus, and the period gene activity oscillates as a result
of PER protein feedback inhibition of its own gene. B) Additional proteins are essential for the
oscillation of the period gene. TIM protein, encoded by the timeless gene is also oscillating and
interacts with PER protein. The interaction is critical for PER protein nuclear accumulation and
repression of the period gene. DBT protein is encoded by the doubletime gene. DBT is a protein
kinase that phosphorylates PER, leading to PER protein degradation. DBT-mediated PER protein
degradation contributes to the delay between period mRNA and PER protein accumulation. CLK and
CYK, encoded by the clock and cycle genes, are two transcription factors that activate the period
gene1.2-02-2022 https://dcpune.academia.edu/SrinivasanKalyanaraman/Papers

Figure 3. The circadian clock has an impact on many aspects of our physiology. This clock
helps to regulate sleep patterns, feeding behavior, hormone release, blood pressure and
body temperature. A large proportion of our genes are regulated by the clock.

Apasmāra (अपस्मार ) is part of the Naṭarāja sculpture found at
the temple of Lokeśvara.—Apasmāra is clad with
a dhotī with kacce clearly traceable. His face is to the left of Śiva,
lifted up, and he has a small horn. He has one necklace. He holds
something in his hand, which may be a broom (?). As per the
description of Apasmāra in Kālikākhaṇḍa of Skandapurāṇa, he should
be black in color, have three heads and three eyes, six protruding
canine teeth, three legs and six hands. Except the protruding canine
teeth no other feature can be traced in any of the images of
Apasmārapuruṣa either in sculptures or in paintings.

Further studies are needed to delineate 1) the role of pineal gland and 2) molecular
mechanisms which result in the increased secretion of melatonin at night.
Exposure to sunlight or a sun lamp has been shown to increase the body's production of
melatonin at night. Melatonin is a hormone produced in the pineal gland and is the key
hormone for setting this body's circadian rhythm.
Bidirectional interactions between sleep, circadian rhythm and epilepsy have been evidenced.
These studies need to be further augmented to delineate 1) the relationship between circadian
rhythm and epilepsy; and 2) develop new treatment strategies to improve seizure control.
These studies in neuroscience will help unravel the neural correlates of consciousness with
greater precision and better understand the metaphor of the Cosmic Dancer arousing the
epileptic patient, apasmāra.
