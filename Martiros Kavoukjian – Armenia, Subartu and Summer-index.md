ARMANI 3
We must say al the outset that the Armam-Armcni (Armanirbe Armens) connection has not found as yet general acceptance in scholarship, mainly because of the following reasons: First, the hypothesis that the Armens were migrants from Europe still dominates Ihe minds of the scholars and this preconceived idea prevents them from thinking of a connection between the Armani of NaramSin, the Armina of Darius, and the Armeni mentioned by the Greeks. The second reason is the difficulty in determining the exact location of Armani, due lo the insufficiency and uncertainty of data. Thirdly, the Armam menlioned by Naram-Sin is being confused with ljalman>Arman, located east of the Tigris, somewhere between Nuzi and Diyala. And fourthly, the name Armani mentioned by Naram-Sin is rendered differently by different scholars and there is not yet unanimity on an accepted form. (Some authors render it Armani, others Armanu or Armanum, and still others prefer Armam'm or the contracted form Arman). Our investigations have revealed (as will be shown below) that apart from the great city-land of Armani mentioned by NaramSin, there have existed two other cities having names of close phonetic similarity. One, as already stated, was located somewhere between Nuzi and Diyala. east of the Tigris, mentioned in different inscriptions in different forms, such as Halmaniwa, Halmanie,
Halman, Ha/wan, and after the Ur HI, as Arman, Armani "of Simesi", Arman of Ugar Sallim, etc. There is also mention of another city by the name Ha/wan (Holwan) in upper Zagros.1" The reason why many scholars render the Armani mentioned by Naram-Sin in different forms is that they sometimes confuse it with the Halman/Arman located in the east of the Tigris. Unfortunately, we do not have on hand (except a few) the photographs or the copies of all the original cuneiform inscriptions for comparison and verification. We have their Latin translitera
tions.
In the known Hiltite inscription that speaks about Naram-Sin's 17 enemy countries, we read the name Ar-ma-ni, the last syllable ni
being represented by the cuneiform sign >
f
c=_ which is a variant utilized by the Hitiitcs. In order to verify the transliteration of the syllable m of the Hiltite text, we have checked in the same inscription the cuneiform signs of three other names having the n; syllable ([x-ijn-ni-pa-i-la, Zi-pa-ni, Ni-ik-ki(...J) and have noticed that
18. See Noie* 7 and 9.



4 ARMENIA, SUBARTU AND SUMER
invariably in all instances Ihe same sign is used for the syllabic
m
'
- This removes the probability of any error and confirms the accuracy of the transtiteration of the last syllable of Armani as m. In Naram-Sin's Akkadian inscriptions the name Armani has also been rendered in ihe following forms: Armanu. Armanum, Armanim or Arman, in which we find, instead of the ending -mt the Akkadian derivative forms *nut -num> -nim> or the contracted form -n. All these varianis, however, do not in any way negate the fact that the ending of Armani is -ni. In Assyro-Babylonian inscriptions the ending -/of nouns is often deleted when the Akkadian grammatical suffixes -uf -um, or -im are added. Thus, in the case of Armani, the derived ending -ni-u becomes -nu, -ni-um becomes -numt -ni-im becomes -n/m, and sometimes -ni becomes -n simply by the deletion of the sound /- We cite ihe following examples for comparison: Mitanni/Mitannu,*9 Mardamani/Mardaman,20 Mardabanum/Mardaban,2] Qattunanim/Qattunant 22 Halukkani/Hatukkail,23 Harmana/Harmani,24 Han&ni/Harr&num/Harr&nim/Har
rSn (passim).25 All these examples support the fact that the correct and exact form of the name under study is Armani, and that it belongs to the Subarian-Hurrian-Nairian group of names ending in -/ii. The exact location of Armani mentioned by Naram*Sin is, undoubtedly, very important. As stated earlier, some authors place it in the east of the Tigris, in the region of the Azeim river, confusing it with ihe city of Halman/Arman located in that area, because of the phonetic similarity of the names. Others have placed Armani in the Zagros region. Later, Hrozni, Speiser and others, following the suggestion of S. Smith, have located Armani at Aleppo, a hypothesis that was subsequently rejected by Guterbock and others. In our book Hay Zhoghovrdi Dzaguma (The Origin of ihe Armenian People) we have shown that it is a mistake to identify Armani with Aleppo, and we have also emphasized that in order to locate Armani accurately, it is necessary to find first the exact

location of Ebla* since the two are mentioned together in Naram-Sin\ inscripiion.

. ARMANI AND EBLA
As it is known, Ebla has been discovered by the Italian archaeologist Prof. Paolo Malthiae, on Tell Mardikh, near the village of Sarakeb in Syria. During 1974-1976, Mallhiae brought to light more than 16 000 tablets of cuneiform inscriptions, the state archives of Ebla, On the basis of this great discovery he published his book, Ebla: An Empire Rediscovered, where he summerizes the results of his excavations up to 1977 and gives his observations and evaluations of the find. In view of the importance that the location of Ebla and the data furnished by the archives bear upon the question of Armani, we would like to mention here some of the information and the viewpoints given by the author, adding our own remarks and evaluations. Earlier, having in view the information given in the inscription of Gudea of Lagash regarding the location of Ebla (and that of **thc city of Ursu of Mount Ebla*'), we had expressed some doubt about identifying the city discovered at Mardikh with the Ebla mentioned by Naram-Sin and Gudea. Also it was not explained how Ebla was
named Mardikh, because it did not seem to be an Arabic name. If
it were a later appellation of the same city, there would have certainly existed a record by a later chronicler to this effect- Unfortunately no such record is known. In our opinion, this problem could have been solved if a temple were to be found at Mardikh dedicated to the famous god Marduk of Babylon (as is the case of Vagharshapat which is also
called Eichmiadzin), but no such indications exist in the Mardikh writings. Even if such an important temple did exist after the time of the archives, it would be very difficult to prove it, because no archives nor any important inscriptions concerning a later period have been discovered as yec in Ebla. In spite of all these, however, the overwhelming weight of the numerous writings, letters and contracts in existence, all written in the name of Ebla and her king, does not leave any doubt that Mar
dikh was indeed Ebla.



6 ARMENIA. SUBARTV AND SUMER
Accepting the identity of Ebla with Mardikh still leaves a problem: Is the Ebla mentioned by Naram-Sin and others the same as this Mardikh-Ebla, orT is it a different city located in some other place? The fact thai Near Eastern inscriptions sometimes mention the
name Ebla under different circumstances leads some scholars to think
lhat ihere mighi have been two or three cities of the same name. It is essential, therefore, to resolve this problem correctly before discussing the question of Armani. For this purpose, we would like first to make some references to certain information regarding Mardikh supplied by Paolo Matthiae,
In his book the author divides the life of Mardikh-Ebla into a
number of chronological periods with the following approximate dates: 3500-2900 B.C., (races of human presence (prehistoric period). 2900-2400 B.C., period of development into a settlement. 2400-2250 B.C.. the first period of Ebla as a great urban and cultural center. The state archives consisting of more than 16 000 clay tablets of cuneiform inscriptions are assumed to belong to this periodThey were discovered under the ruins of the citadel's palace which, according lo the author, was burned and destroyed by Naram-Sin in 2250 B.C. after 150 years of prominence. i 2250-2000 B.C., when the city was reconstructed (except the palace that housed the archives), and was destroyed again. 2000-1600 B.C., when the city reflourished and became a great urban center, and was finally destroyed, presumably, by the
Hittites*
According to the information given, the period represented by the archives was Ebla's golden age of economic prosperity and political power. The more than 16 000 clay tablets contain mostly commercial and accounting records. Documents of military, political and historical content are very few and of little significance and in their vague-. ness do not represent the expected historiographic value. J The nature of the contents of the archives gives us the impression that Ebla was not a powerful military-political empire. All empires of great military strength, like the Akkadian, Assyrian, Hittite, and others, have left insc
r
iptions that speak mostly of their invasions and conquests, the massacres and the destructions they have inflicted and the slaves they have carried away, whereas in the archival documents of Ebla we do not find any striking information about such events, not even about significant construction works. Perhaps

ARMANI 7
the particular period depicted by the archives was too early for autocratic rulers to indulge in military exploits and political expansions, a practice that seems to have started in the Near East with the daring kings of the great Akkadian dynasty and intensified towards the end of the third millenium B.C. It is true, nonetheless, that Ebla has had some incipient ventures, such as the victorious wars she had fought against Mari. In her days of prosperity Ebla was a great and well-developed center noted for her textile and agricultural products and furniture industry* There arc indications that she had established commercial (not military or imperialistic) bases and colonies in countries far and ncarf from which, presumably, she received lax revenues and employed mercenary soldiers (rather than raising her own permanent army) for the protection of these colonies and possibly for the security of the caravan routes* In a letter given to the royal emissary of yamaxi by the governor of the palace of Ebla there seems to be an instance of demanding mercenaries in exchange of goods." All these indicate that if Ebla has ever been an empire", it was a commercial empire thai had international peaceful relations considered quite extensive
for her lime,
MA tablet from the Old Akkadian level of Nuzi (then called
Gasur) represents a map of the region on which towns are marked
with little circles; the only fully extant name reads maS-gan BAD-Eb-la,
i-e-, maSkan (settlement of) DOrJS&te."21 If this is really another Ebla, then we think it is quite possible for it to be one of the commercial colonies of the actual Mardikh*Eblat called by the same name, since it was not unusual in those days lo call the colonics by the name of the mother country or city, We have made these introductory remarks about Ebla because, as we have said earlier, the discovery of its location and the data supplied by the archives are very important for resolving the question of Armani- We find, however, that as some problems find their explanations in these archives, one unexpected enigma arises: In all the inscriptions read so far, the name Armani is absent, In the Ebla inscriptions there is frequent mention of the term

Ar-mjKI, Prof- Mailhiae. apparently in the earlier stages of hasty
reading, has assumed this term to be a proper noun designating a city and has supposition ally identified it with Armani,** and further
more, beint; influenced by the unproven hypnlhcsjs of S. Smiih and
others, has idemified Armani (together with Ar-mi) with Aleppo. But later, Prof- G, Petlinato, the epigrapher of the Ebla expedition, deepening his research on the reading and Interpretation of the inscriptions, has read and translated the word Ar-m/KI not as a proper noun but as a common noun meaning *ciliesVl Thus it becomes evident that in the archival writings of Ebla, while the names of hundreds of cities, far and near, are mentioned by virtue
of her extensive international commercial ties, the name Armani is
conscpicuously absent. At present we sec two possible explanations for this puzzling
situation.
The first is that the destruction of Ebla in the pe
r
iod of the archival inscriptions did not occur in the days of Naram-Sin (who mentions Armani and Ebla together), but much earlier. According to Matthiac, the period represented by the archival writings spans 150 years (70 years according to Peltinato), during which time five
kings have occupied the throne of Ebla, The la
t
f king was Ibbi-SipiS in whose days the city was burned and destroyed together with the citadel's main palace, under the ruins of which the tablets have been discovered* If Ebla were destroyed by Naram-Sin, then, in his inscriptions, along with King RiS-TcSub (Red-Adad) of Armani, the name of King Ibbi-SipiS too should have been mentioned (or at least the name of one of the kings recorded in Ihc archives). The fact that the name of the king of Ebla is absent from the inscription leads us to think that in the days of Naram-Sin as well Ebla was under the rule of the king of Armani. Therefore, the absence of
Armani in the archives of Ebla and the omission of the name of
the king of Ebla in Naram-Sin's inscription suggest that the destruction of Ebla did not take place in the time of Naram-Sin. but much earlier* Thus* Prof. Pcttinalo's conclusion of placing the date of
the archives of Ebla at 2S0O B.C. seems to us to be more accurate.
According to certain existing data, in the lime of Akkadian Sargon, Ebla was in Armani*s sphere of influence- ll could be that in these earlier years of the archives period Armani was perhaps
JO. EEfi, 177. 31- A£, 78, 151, 248, 258,



ARMANI 9
not powerful and large enough and not yet organized to constitute an important political and governmental center, much the same as Akkad, which, too, is absent from the archival records of Ebla. Secondly, if we suppose that in those days Armani did exist as a strong political center having Ebla in her sphere of influence, then the relationships between Armani and Ebla could not have had thai particular nature under the circumstances of which many foreign cities, far and near, have been included in the archival records. In fact,
no city situated beyond the KaneS-Harran-ASSur-fjamazi line in the Armenian Highland has entered into the circle of business transac
tions of Ebla.
When Ebla was subject to Armani, her rulers could have had some sort of family relations with Armani's royal house. It will be
shown below that Armani was Subanan.
The name Sennam of the first king of the city of Ursu that had close tics with Ebla was a genuine Hurrian (or Subarian) name.32
The torso of a statue has been unearthed in Ebla. which is dated
by Prof. Matlhiae 2000-1900 B.C. According to the Akkadian inscription on this torso, the father of Ibbii-Lim, king of Ebla. was called IgriS-iJepa, which, as seen clearly, consists of a combination of two ethnically different, Amorite and Hurrian (or Subarian), names.
G
. Pettinato, drawing our attention to this particular point, writes:
"This would indicate that Ebla stood at the crossroad of two ethnic
components - Amorite and Hurrian - living peaceably in Ebla.*'33 The inscriptions of Alalakh IV mention a certain man, by the
name Efrli-TcSup. who came from Ebla.34 It is not dif
f
icult to see that the name TeSup is Subarian. Already in Ebla. in the time of the archives, there were in office a governor called Subur" and a production boss or master called by the Subarian name Guzuzi.*6 There
are also the names Ar-Ennum and Irkab-Ar, about which we shall
speak in the 4th section of this Chapter. Here we may also ask if it could not be possible that the following words in a letter w
r
itten by Ibubu, the governor of the palace of Ebla, to the emissary of the king of Mamazi, would indicate the kinship between the rulers of Ebla and Hamazi: "You (are my) brother and I (am your) brother;

(fo you) man-brother ... Irkab-Damu, king Of Ebia (is) brother of Zizi, king of Hamazi; Zizi, king of hfamazi (is) brother of IrkabDamu, king of Ebla."sl It is known that in later periods foreign kings have sometimes called each other "brother" alluding to their divine origin, but any proof or example showing the existence of this practice in a period as early as this is unknown to us. The kings of Ebia were elected or appointed, hence their kingship was neither hereditary nor of divine origin. Furthermore, here it is the governor of the palace that calls Hamazi's emissary "man-brother". In any case, this particular point is worth our attention.
In this connection one must not forget the very important fact that in the time of the archives, among the divinities worshiped at Ebia, there was a number of gods that were considered Human. This is what G. Pettinato says about this point:
The presence of Human divinities AStabi and Adamma together with the Semitic gods Dagan, Beli, Hadad, IStar, and Kami!* permits the identification of the two ethnic components of Eblaite society of this period, the Semites and the Hurrians. This is one of the most precious items issuing
from the archives.58
Then Pettinato adds the following in a subsequent section
of his book:
Thanks to the presence of foreign divinities in the Eblaite pantheon, one can prove the presence already in this period in the Near East of peoples thought to have arrived somewhat later. The most interesting case regards the Hurrians. an Indo-European people attested for the first time toward 2300
B
.C. The Eblaites accepted at least four deities of the Hurrian
pantheon: dAdamma, dASlabi, dyapat, and d15hara. The
presence above all, of AStabi, the great war god, leaves little doubt that the Hurrians were active in this period and had
strict ties with Ebia."
The fact that Armani is not mentioned in the archives of Ebia can also be explained by the assumption that the Armenian Highland
37. AE. 97-98. 38. Ibid., 152. 39. Ibid., 251.



ARMANI II
did not need the products of Ebla, Being itself rich in precious metals and with forests that provided the necessary materials for the production of furniture and other items* the Armenian Highland had, even before Ebla, developed an industry and commercial ties with Southern Mesopotamia, We shall speak about this in connection with Mcdzamor in the Chapter Araffa and Erech. There was no room, therefore, in the Armenian Highland for Ebla's commercial expansions. As for the wrong hypothesis of identifying Armani with Aleppo, we must say that it has been rejected long ago, as mentioned above, by Guterbock and others. We have already shown the fallacy of this hypothesis in our previous study* The archives of Ebla are not the only place where the name of Aleppo is absent; Sargon of Akkad, Naram-Sin, and Gudea, who all have passed through or near Aleppo on the Ebla-Amanus way of their invasions, do not mention it- It is very probable, therefore, that Aleppo was not in existence as a significant city-center in the third millenium B.C. In fact, available information suggests that it was organized as an important center only at the beginning of the second millenium. It follows, then, that Aleppo could not have been Armani; furthermore, Armani is mentioned by the Hittite kings both before and after making mention of Aleppo, and the Alalakh inscriptions at which time yalab was well known, still retained the name Anna (=Armani).
40
We also think it very probable that the name Halab must have been related to the Arabic word v-U balaba (Ho milk1), which may suggest (supported also by local tradition) that earlier Aleppo was a place of gathering and milking of sheep for a certain tribe or tribes, At the same time, $atb<i in Sumerian ihalpu in Akkadian) means 4fountain-weir, which in its turn, suggests the existence of a water fountain or well at thai place (Aleppo is famous of its wells)
around which the first inhabitants of that town were settled with
their milk-producing animals. (It is also possible that the Arabic word halaha (*to milk*) and the Sumero-Akkadian word faalha-halpO ('fountain*) may have the same origin.) All these considerations may indicate that this city was called tfalab-Halba from the day of its origin, thus excluding any period of time when it could have
been called Armani. It is also difficult to connect Armani with the name Ha/mam,
40. NH. 16,

as is done in one occasion where the scribe of-Shalmaneser III has
erroneously mentioned Aleppo, which has led S< Smith to identify this city with Armani.41 Earlier we raised the queslion as to whether there could not have been another city besides Mardikh that also was called Ebla. In fact, Michael Astour cites a number of sources in his article showing thai Ihere was indeed another city by Ihe same name, Eblaf lo the cast of Ihe Tigris, somewhere between Nuzi and Diyala, which was called, as noted, "maSkan (settlement of) Dur-Ebla." Examinations show, however, thai the Ebla mentioned in the ins
criptions of Akkadian Sargon, Gudca, and Alalakh is none other than Mardikh-Ebla. Here I quote from Sargon's inscription ihe portion that is directly related to our problem under study; King Sargon worshiped Dagan at Tutuli, in the upper land He gave Man, Yarmuti, and Ebla, up to the Cedar Forest and the Silver Mountains* to Sargon ,.,"42 II is obvious that in order to get to these countries, Sargon must have moved (from Akkad) upward along the Euphrates. Of the upper lands, he has reached first Mar/ (on the Iraqi-Syrian border at the intersection of the Euphrates), and then Yarmuti (he has also been at Tuttul, at the temple of Dagan). Then he has moved loward Ebla and from there to the Cedar Forest and the Silver Mountains in the region of Cilicia. As it is already seen, Mardikh is on the route from Mari to Cilicia (see Map I). Therefore, the Ebla mentioned by Sargon
cannol be other than Mardikh.
It becomes important now to determine whether the Ebla mentioned by Naram-Sin is also that at Mardikh or is it the other Ebla, supposedly placed in ihe east of the Tigris. Here is a copy of the three columns, and an important portion of the fourth, of NaramSin's famous Akkadian inscription, with its translation, which has
4K M Astour writes in his article (NH, 16); "There is no proof thai Aleppo was actually known as Halman to anybody except Shalmaneser Ill's scribe. In all other sources it appears as fjalab (Mari, Alalakh VII, Alalakh IV. Egypt, Ugartt, Middle-Babylonian, Neo-Assyrian, OAram) or Halba/Halpa (Hittite), It would seem that the Assyrian scribe, who was much belter acquainted with the Transtigris than with Syria, replaced the actual name of the dty with a consonant and more familiar one. Similarly, the North Syrian mountain which appears in some editions of the same king's annals under its correct name Atallur, is given in other versions the name Lallar which belonged to a peak in the Zagros range/* 42.

Never since the creation of mankind has any king among kings taken Arman(um) and Ebla. Nergal opened the road for Naram-Sin, the strong, and gave him Armanum and Ebla; he bestowed on him also Amanus. the Mountain
of Cedars, and the Upper Sea. Thanks to the might of Dagan. who exalts his majesty. Naram-Sin the strong conquered Arman(um) and Ebla and. from the bank of the Euphrates to Ulisum. struck down the peoples whom Dagan delivered into his hands and they bore the basket of (became liable to do service to) Aba. his god. and he had in his power the Amanus, the Cedar Mountain.

dedicated it to Sin, (saying) thus "Naram-Sin the mighty, king of the four regions, when Dagan gave Arman(um) and Ebla into my hands, and I bound RiS-TeSub. the king of Arman(um). at that time I made my likeness. And he (!) dedicated it to Sin. Whosoever damages my name, having smashed my statue

Wc see a second clear and direct indication in Naram-Sin's
words, particularly where he says: "From the banks of the Euphrates to Ulisum. struck down the peoples whom Dagan delivered into his hands." In Gadd and Legrain's work (p. 80) Ulisu(m) is placed at the
shores of the Mediterranean. This means that Naram-Sin's main
invasion route was from the banks of the Euphrates (near Mari and Tutlul where was the famous temple of Dagan, seeing that he was

. THE LOCATION OF ARMANI
We must now address ihe question: Where was the Armani mentioned by Naram-Sin? First of all it is clear that the city of Halwan / Halman > Arman. located in the region of Diyala. cast of the Tigris, was very far from and out of Naram-Sin's route from the Euphrates to Ulisu (al the Mediterranean shore), Amanus, and Cilicia. It follows that the Armani mentioned by Naram-Sin could not be the Halman which is placed in the east of the Tigris. Where, or, on which side of (he Euphrates
was, then. Armani? Our studies have shown that the central regions of the land of the city-land of Armani were located upwards of Tuttul44 and not on the west, but on the immediate east of the Euphrates. We have seen before that Sargon, prior to invading Ebla, "worshiped the god Dagan in the city of Tuttul" located on the bank of the Euphrates, about 70 km below Raqqah. There is evidence that Dagan of Tuttul (his temple at Tuttul) was so famous and venerated that even Ebla, though counting Dagan among her own main deities,45 still used to send valuable gifts to the Dagan of Tuttul.46 Naram-Sin also writes that "thanks to Dagan" or "when Dagan judged the judgment in favour of Naram-Sin", he conquered Armani and the others were delivered into his hands. Because of their great importance for determining the location of Armani, I would like to
quote once again Naram-Sins's words to focus our attention:
Thanks to the might of Dagan ... Naram-Sin the strong conquered Arman(um) and Ebla and. from the bank of the Euphrates to Ulisum. struck down the peoples whom Dagan delivered into his hands ... and he had in his power the Amanus, the Cedar Mountain. When Dagan judged the judgment in favour of Naram-Sin the mighty, delivered Rid-Adad (RiS-Te5ub), the king of Arman(um), into his hands; ...

, or "an unspecirird quantity of gold for the decoration of a table and for a gold vase, gifts of Ib
r
ium, for Dagan of Tullul.'



ARMANI 17
This statement clearly shows that Naram-Sin was able to conquer Armani thanks to "Dagan judging thcjudgmem in his favour." What we understand from these words is thai Naram-Sin. like his grandfather Sargon, was at the city of Tuttul worshiping at the famous temple of Dagan; in other words, he asked Dagan for assistance before invading the mighty Armani, and Dagan, through his oracle pronounced by the priests, judged the judgment in his favour. Thereupon, he invaded Armani that was nearby, before moving on to the lands extending from the Euphrates to UUsu(m) up to the Medi
terranean shore, i.e. Ebla, Amanus, and the Cedar Mountain. It becomes clear now, that Armani must have been located upwards of Tuttul (past Tuttul traveling upstream where the river bends west) and to the east of the Euphrates. We have already seen that when Sargon began his invasion upward the Euphrates proceeding through the Mari-Yarmuti-Ebla-Amanus route, obviously he did not come across Armani, since he makes no mention of it. If Armani were located in the west of the Euphrates. on Sargon's route from Mari to Amanus, he certainly would not have missed it and would not have failed to mention it, particularly that it was a well-known city-land at that time, such as that "never since the creation of mankind had any king among kings taken [it] before Naram-Sin." But Armani could not have been too far either, because, as it was pointed out, according to one inscription,47 we know thai in the lime of Sargon Ebla was within the sphere of
Armani.
It is clear, therefore, thai the city-center of Armani was located east of the Euphrates, k was here that Naram-Sin defeated the king of Armani, after which he proceeded to acquire the territories between the Euphrates and the Mediterranean, that is. Ebla. Amanus,
and the Cedar Mountain.
We find that only after defeating the mighty king of Armani immediately to the east of the Euphrates and north of Tuttul did Naram-Sin feel himself secure enough to invade west of the Euphrates, to Ebla and Amanus. There are indications that in those days as well Ebla was under the rule of the king of Armani,48 because,
47. Wc have meniioned this inscription in lhe section Cuneiform Sources thai Mention the Name Armani (No. S). We shall mention it again below. 48. This same opinion is expressed in the work of Gadd and Legrain (URI, 78), where ic says: "Note that the wording of the present text, especially of 11.23-28, suggests thai Rid-Adad (RiS-TeSub] was not only king of Arman but also ruled
Ebla."



18 ARMENIA. SUBARTU AND SUMER
while on ihe one hand Naram-Sin proudly and repeatedly slates thai
he has defeated King RiS-TeSub of Armani, on the other hand he does not make any reference to the king of Ebla. as if implying that by defeating the king of Armani, Ebla (and Amanus as well) has easily
fallen into his hands. This confirms that Armani was not far from
the Euphrates. We think, therefore, that Armani was located in the area of the sources of the Khabur river, in the region of Armenian Mesopotamia and Aghtznik. N. Adontz had already asserted in his lime that the Armani mentioned by Naram-Sin is other than yalman. placed east of the Tig
r
is, in the region of Diyala, north of Khanakin. He had pointed out that the location of Armani must be in the north of Syria.49 It is interesting to note here lhat the region of the sources of the Khabur river was called Hark'(Harki) by Adad-Nirari II.50 The question arises now as to why is it that Sargon also did not find it necessary to invade Armani before invading Ebla, since we have data indicating that in his time as well Ebla was within the country or the sphere of influence of Armani. There could be different reasons for this: It is possible that in those days Armani was in a difficult situation; or, perhaps Sargon was maintaining friendly relations with Armani and (hat the main purpose of his Ebla-Amanus invasion was not so much to conquer Ebla as to obtain lumber for his construction projects from the forests of cedar trees of Amanus. The reason for having friendly or traditional ties with Armani could be attributed to the fact that the city of Azubirani, Sargon's home and birthplace, was probably in the land of Armani-Subari. (See Footnote 95 on this topic.) We find that Armani was, if not the capital, at least one of the royal cities of Subartu, a large country of the epoch, whose boundaries at the time must have extended to the approaches of Tuttul in the south, to Nuzi-Lullubi in the east, and to the Ebla-Ugarit-Alalakh region in the west. The Armani-Subari equivalence will be shown further in the third section of Chapter Two. where we shall speak about
the names Armarili and Su
r
ili.
In a late Ur copy of one of his inscriptions, Naram-Sin calls himself the ruler "of all E/am up to BarahSum and of Subarrum up to the Cedar Forest." (Mat ElamtimK' ga-h-sa-ma a-ti-ma Ba-ra-ahSimK1u mat SUBURiU bll'-,itnKI a-ti-ma "kiSti erinim.)*1 1. Gclb, in wri

ling about this Subartu. states that it extended from BaraMum (cast of Diyala) to the Cedar Forest of Amanus.'2 (This shows thai Ebla was also included in Subartu.) These borders of Subartu coincided later with the borders of Mitanni. It is known in fact that in the limes of SauSSatar-Sutarna, Mitanni comprised Nuzi in the east and Ala
lakh in the west."
In the known Hllllle inscription that speaks about Naram-Sin's
17 enemies, the location of Armani coincides exactly with the location of this Subartu. In the text the land of ParaSi (= BarabSum) is found in the 9'h place of the listing of the 17 enemies. The name of the country and her king occupying the 10'h place of the listing are on a damaged portion of the inscription and cannot be read (indicated by dots in brackets in the transliteration). Armani is in the 1 llh place and the land of the Cedar Forest the I2h. This particular order shows that geographically Armani was located between the land of ParaSi (MarhaSi) and the land of the Cedar Forest (Amanus-Cilicia). but closer to the latter, since there was another country between ParaSi and Armani, This evidence also puis Armani in the region of
Subari, in the area of the basin of the sources of the Khabur and
the Western Tigris, ih Armenian Mesopotamia and around Aghtznik. The victory monument of Naram-Sin found near Diyarbekir (in situ)
and now in the Istanbul museum, must be considered a concrete
evidence that Naram-Sin has been in this particular area (Aghtznik) of the Armenian Highland and has fought against its forces. A specific indication to the supremacy of Armani over Ebla may also be found in the boastful words of Naram-Sin that "never since i he creation of mankind has any king among kings taken Armani and Ebla," In fact, we know (and Naram-Sin should have known too) that Sargon had "taken" Ebla. It seems, therefore, thai Naram-Sin's main emphasis here is essentially on mighty Armani and not so much
on Ebla.
This interpretation makes it clearer now why Naram-Sin mentions twice and with considerable pride his victory over the king of Armani, but does not mention the king of Ebla. and why in the Hiltite text Armani and her king are mentioned and Ebla is totally
absent.
52. Ibid. The same is accepted by C.l. Gadd and L. Lcgram; see URI, 73. Cdb (and others) accepting the BarahSum = Mar ali = Paraii equation, place this BarabSum "approximately" in the east of Diyala. See also Marffaii in our Map I.

Reference was made above lo a siaiement found in a Neo
Assy
r
ian copy of an inscription lhal speaks aboul the regions of the empire of Sargon of Akkad. The statement reads as follows: "i$tu Eb-Ia adi Bit-Na-ni-ib KUR Ar-ma-ni-iU" ("From Ebla to Bilnanib [inl the land of Armani.")54 If we understand these words, as all authors do, meaning that the area from Ebla to Bitnanib was within the land of Armani, then we can consider it as another concrete proof for the extensiveness of Armani and her supremacy over Ebla in the times of Sargon. Some authors place this Armani and Ebla pair in the east of the Tigris (around Kirkuk). but it is dif
f
icult to accept the existence of a second such pair other than the one mentioned by Naram-Sin. There is no direct and concrete testimony whereby the Armani and Ebla mentioned in this copied description of the Akkadian Sargon's empire can be placed to the east of the Tigris. The only reason for this placement is the fact that they are mentioned along with the names of the countries of Sargon's empire that lie (according to these authors) to the east of the Tigris, based on the assumption that these countries represent one geographical milieu or that their enumeration follows exact geographical sequence, conditions that are not always observed. Actually it is very difficult to determine the exact location of all the countries that were part of Sargon's empire or to trace its boundaries accurately. N. Adonlz places Armani "near the western borders of the state of Akkadian Sargon"," and Mardikh-Ebla falls rather within this region.54 In Sargon's inscription the name is written clearly as Armani and not as Halman or tfalwan, which only in a much later period began to be called Alman>Arman. (It is equally unacceptable to assume that Sargon's original inscription had the word Halman which was changed to Armani in copying.)

According to the information given by Maiihiae, In the writings of Mardikh-Ebla. the ruler of Ebla is not called lugal Iking), but en {lord). Accepting ihe plausibility of Matthiae's interpreialion regarding the en = malikum equivalence (even though the Arabic miiiAun means likewise 'lord' (owner), it is imponam, nonetheless, to keep in mind that Ihe term en might have been used rather in a religious sense as 'lord* (high p

ictly in Ihe political sense as an 'autocratic king'
. In the time of Ihe
archives of Ebla there still existed a Community (Elders') Couocll that elected the lugal or the en. positions that have not always been hereditary.



ARMANI 21
What was said above does nol necessarily exclude !he probability that another Ebla may have existed other than Mardikh-Ebla. such as the already mentioned maSkan DOr-Ebla. which is placed by some authors in the east of the Tigris. But this great land of Armani which includes Ebla must be the same as the mighlly Armani mentioned by Naram-Sin. Accepting that both the Armani In the Armani and Ebla pair of Naram-Sin's inscription and the Armani in the Armani and Ebla pair of Sargon's inscription represent the same great Armani, we do not think it improbable that theEWas may have been different, one being Mardikh-Ebla and the other maSkan Dur-Ebla. because as it was noted, Armani included also the Eastern Khabur in central Subartu. Never
theless, in view of all the above considerations regarding the probability of Mardikh-Ebla being subservient to the mighty Armani, it seems more likely to us that the Armani and Ebla pair mentioned by Sargon corresponds to the one mentioned by Naram-Sin. The Arma mentioned in the inscriptions of Alalakh IV must be the same as Ihe nearby city-land of Arma-ni referred lo by NaramSin, or the name of one of its regions or cities, without the topony
mic suffix -ni, similar to the form Arme. Just as we have, as an
eponym. the personal or ethnic name Armcn derived from the place (or ethnic) name Armem", and the personal name Armanca*; (<Armani + ak, U.pifuiGbuil]<U.pi/uiU[i + uil|) derived from Armani, similarly we have the personal name Harma, iuipifm {as preserved by Khorenatsi) derived from the form Arma, where the initial h sound is added for intensification (cf. aganil>hagnil, uiq.uiD|n>hiucjDfnl
etc.). In conclusion, we can say that all known data show that the southern part of the great country of Armani which included Ihe city of Armani mentioned by Naram-Sin, was located around the regions of the sources of the Khabur and the Western Tigris and that it constituted the important part of Subartu including the Armenian Mesopotamia and Aghlznik. Some 12-13 centuries after Naram-Sin, at Ihe end of the second and at the beginning of the first millenium B.C. the kings of Assyria have recorded ihe name of this region of Armani in Ihe form of Arime.

. ARIME (ARMANI) AND SUBARTU
In a lengthy inscription that speaks aboul some of his invasions, Adad-Nirari II (911-891 B.C.) gives direct and concrete explanations about the geographical locations of a number of cities in (he land of
A
r
ime making it possible for us to form an accurate picture about the geographical regions thai were part of that great county. Here is his exact testimony (I quote only (hose sections (hat interest us):
... in tha( year, and in the month KiSlimu, ... from above the river Habur, the land Harki (?), as far as the city of Carchemish, which is in Hatt he raided in that year and in the month Airu, during an expedUion against the land Arime, (in) the city of Pausa, which lies at the fool of Mount KaSiari (?), he fought (a battle). In that yeai and in the same month, during an expedition against the land Arime, at the entrance (lit,, head) of the city of Nabula57 he fought (a battle)... . In the same year, and in the same month, during an expedition against the land of Arime, in Ihe city of Tibua (?), which is on the Tigris, he fought a battle ... . In that year, and in the month Ululu, during an expedition against the land Arime, in the city of Murarir (?), which is in
the land of Supr
f
i, he fought a battlc.5fl
As we sec clearly, Adad-Nirari explicitly slates that one of the regions of the land of Arime which he invaded was at the fool of the
Kashia
r
i mountain, another was on the Tigris and still another was in the land of Suprc (Subre). In other words, the land of Arime included a portion of the Tigris (certainly the region of ils head
waters), the Kashia
r
i mountain, and Subre. This direct testimony by Adad-Nirari links the land of Arime unquestionably with that of
Subartu-Subr6.

fusion in hisioriography* In the earlier stages of c
r
iiical histo
r
iography in the last century, the idea was advanced that the terms A/ma or Aram, and Anme or Arme arc Semiiic and pertain to the Semites. This idea was so deeply rooted that even some of the well-known
scholars reflect it in their works.
The noted orienialist, I, Diakonoff. considering that Armenians do not utilize the term Armcn to identify themselves, makes the supposition that the name Armina (Armini - Armeni) is given to Armenia and the Armenians because of their neighborhood to the Aramaeans in the southern region of Hayk\ Speaking about the
name Armeni, he writes:
The Aramaeans called the Hayk* - ArmtnS which was
an Aramaidzed form of what can be reconstructed as Urart
ian Armini meaning 'the land or/and the inhabitants of Arme (Sasoun)'. the nearest region inhabited by the Hayk'
to the North of the Aramaeans; ... Even if Armanum should
prove the same country as the later Arme, at the early pe
r
iod of the Akkadian dynasty it can have had nothing to do with the forefathers of the Armenians; but it is much more probable that the country is to be sought somewhere to the East or North-East of Babylonia.5*
As we see, Diakonoff supposes that Armenia is called Armina or Armini (Armeni) after the name Arme, the region closest to the Aramaeans in the Diyarbckir area that was inhabited by Armenians, It is interesting to note here thai while consenting to the probability of the Arme = Armanum equation, the respectable scholar places Armanum again in the northeast of Babylonia, whereby it becomes very difficult to accept that the Diyarbckir region could have been called Arme after the name of a city situated in the northeast of Babylonia, One might wonder if the Arims mentioned in Homer's Iliad and the Urartian kings Arame and Erimena were called by these names because they, too, were in proximity to the Semitic Aramaeans, or
59- This statement is quoted from Diakonoffs letter of 20 December 1967 addressed to me. I wish to express my thanks to the noted scholar for allowing mc, by his letter of 27 February 19*4, to make these quotations. He has also stated in bis second letter that Arme must now be placed below Sasoun, havinf as its center Nekheria, which is found within the Sivcrck'DiyarbekirMardin triangle.

because these names were given to them by Aramaean sc
r
ibes! The idea of seeing a Semitic origin in the names Anna. Aram,
A
r
im, Arime, Armc, Armani, Armina. Armcni, and the like, has become such an obsession with some authors that it prevents them from seeing the essence of the interrelationships between the Armen
ian Highland and Northern Mesopotamia, and creates added dif
f
iculties for the clarification of certain obscure problems rdaied to them.
The fact is that the very name Aram has no connection of o
r
igin with those Semites who were later called Aramaeans. A careful study
of the cuneiform documents of the Near East shows that the Semitic
nomadic tribes that were later called Aramaeans, were previously known by (he names Sul
f
l and Afylame, They had come to Northern
Mesopotamia and settled in the territories of Mitanni (Naha
r
ina) which was either destroyed or about to be destroyed at that time, and they
were called Aramaeans after the ancient name Arma or A
r
am of the
land on which they settled. A similar example is the case of the Egyptians; the name Egypt did not belong to the Arabs, but they have come and settled in the land of Egypt, and by this ancient name of the land they were (and still are) called Egyptians.
J
. Myers had w
r
itten earlier that the Aramaeans seem to have
started to come out of Northeastern Arabia around 1350 B.C. when
nomadic marauders whom the Babylonian kings called "Suti and Achlame" were spreading, looting and devastating along the entire Euphratian border.10
R
. O'Callaghan has the following to say about the appearance
of these Semitic tribes: "The SutQ and the AkhlMmu are first men
tioned in Assyrian sources as appearing in the time of Arik-dBn-ili (1316-1305) of Assyria. The former name is connected with the Egyptian S[tyw, meaning "Asiatics". Thus as a matter of fact they do service as Egyptian mercenaries
We see an indication to the recent appearance of these t
r
ibes in Northern Mesopotamia in the following statement of Adad-Nirari I (dr. 1310-1280 B.C.): " ... conqueror of the lands of Turuki and Nigimhi in their totality, together with all their kings, mountains, and highlands, the territory of widespreading Kutt (v. adds, conqueror
of Kuimu|}i and all of its allies), the hordes of the A
f
ylamt and Suti, the lauri and their lands, who enlarged boundary and frontier ..."62

ARMANI 25
As we see. according to Adad-Nirari's assertion, at the beginning of
the 13lh century these Semitic t
r
ibes were still in the process of enlarging their borders by moving forth and occupying new territories that did not belong to them. And the king of Assyria still calls them by their original names, Suti and Ablame; in other words, they were not yet called Ahms or Arams, This period must correspond to the days of Mitanni's downfall, because, obviously, these tribes could not have occupied these Mitannian lands in the Kashiari-Kulmukhi regions in her days of power (there must have been though some AssyroBabylonian elements in the land, but their numbers and role must have been of no decisive significance). Alfred Haldar assesses correctly the situation of those days when he writes: "ll is a fact that there was a general decline of civilization in the Near East about 1200 B.C. and the following centuries."6* In the time of Shalmanescr I (1266-1243 B.C.) these Semitic tribes, as the allies of the Hittiles. had already penetrated into the lands of Hanigalbat. but they were still called by their original name,
Ahlamu. and were not considered Aramaeans. Here is what Shalma
nescr says:
... When with the behest of the great gods. I advanced against the land of Hanigalbat with the mighty hosts of my lord ASSur, I forced my way over difficult roads and narrow passes. Shattuara, king of Hani (v. has. Hanigalbat), the army of Hillites and A()lamT with him, 1 surrounded ... and I fought a battle and 1 accomplished their defeat ... The army of Hittitcs and Ahlami, his allies, I slaughtered ...64
As we can see. these nomadic newcomers called Afjlamf have already become Hillites' allies, but still they are called by their original name. Afylamf. that is, they are not yet called Aramaeans. Bit-ZamSni (Diyarbekir region) represents the farthest penetra
tion to the north of these Semites.
About one century and a half after Shalmcncscr 1, in the time of Tiglalh-Pileser 1 (1115-1077 B.C.), many of the Ahlami incomers have already become the inhabitants of Arma, that is. men of Arma. Tiglath-Pilescr writes: "... a na libbi afi-la-mi-i TMRAr-fna-a-iaMI*

... [into] Ihemidsi of the Ahlami. the men of Arma, who were
enemies of Ashur my lord, I marched. From Sukhi to the city of
Carchemish, in the land of Hatie. in one day I raided ...,,) Here it is clearly seen thai Arma, with its determinative KUR. is a land-name, and not an ethnic designation; Ahlami is the name
of the tribe thai became the inhabitants of Arma. We see the same picture in the time of Adad-Nirari II (911-891
B
.C.) when these Semitic tribes, having already settled in the land,
have now added the term Aramaean to their tribal name Ahlami.6*
Furlhermorc. the term Afjlami Aramaeans shows that at thai time there
were also non-Ahlami Aramaeans.
As we have seen above, the information we obtain from Ihe
inscription of Adad-Nirari II speaking about a few of his invasions
lo Ihe land of Arimc shows that in his time the name Arime was a
geographical term designating large expanses of land. Under this name were grouped the mountainous regions of the North as well as the plains of the South, all belonging to the land of Subari and the stale of Milanni. The main central regions of the state of Mitanni were in the mountain belt in the North, and this region was known earlier by the
name Arma (Arma-ni). The names Arma and Aram arc derived from the same root with which are connected the later forms: Arim. Arime. Arme, Vrme, and others.
R
. O'Callaghan, as a conclusion to his investigation of the topic, writes: "Semamically, why any people should be called Aramaeans
we arc not in a position to say. It is most reasonable to think that
the word was first a place name, possibly a mountain city Arma. mentioned by Shalmanesar /."67 This city must have existed even in the time of Naram-Sin in the region of Armani. In one of Naram-Sin's inscriptions it is written: "Naram-Sin, king of the four regions, when he warred against Harshamadki. lord of A-ra-am and Am: in Ti-ha-ar. the mountain, he
overcame him.'' It seems that the city Ar-am (or Ara-am) was one of Ihe cities in the region of Armani possibly in the region of ihe

ihc name of the cily Amedu or Amida (Diyarbekir), where the -du or -da endings must be considered toponymic suffixes (cf. Ayadu (land), Arsidu (mounlain). Tayda and Irida (forircsses),w also
Kruda. Baruata i = Bit-Barua], etc). We already know ihal Naram
Sin's victory monument was found near Amida. A cily called Arramu (ar-ra-muu) is mentioned together with the city of Muraru (mu-ra-ru1 ) in the Ebla inscriptions.70 If this Arramu (or Aramu) is the city of Aram (a-ra-am) mentioned by Naram-Sin, then its being mentioned with Muraru could be an indication that it
was in Arme-Sub
r
ia or in its vicinity, because, according to the inscription of Adad-Nirari II mentioned above, Murarir was in the land
of Subri.
In our earlier works, talking about the etymology of the na
tional name Ar-ma-ni/Ar-mc-ni of Armenians, we have shown thai
it originates from the name of their national sun-god Ar (or Ara) and means sons of Ar (the component ma or me meaning 'to beget, offspring. or son'
, hence Ar-mc-ni literally meaning 'ar-son-s') and that they have called themselves simply Ar. (We shall come back to this topic in the chapter The Land and People of Ar.) We have already mentioned above that the name Aram docs not belong to the Semites; on the contrary, it belongs to the people of the Armenian Highland who were called Ar or Armani/Armcn. The name Ar-am. like Ar-ma. is constructed on the root ar. The ending -am seems to be a substitution for -ma, or they are variants. Gelb, in speaking about the names yupitam, PuSam and Sefylam, which he has included in his list of Hurrian personal names, pays particular
attention to this suffix -am and w
r
ites the following: "Interesting is the suffix -am flater -a) found in the Old Akkadian name Hapiram, in the UR III names Hupitam. Schhim. and Puiam, and in several later Chagar Bazar names: Apiam. IJupitam, Seham. Scnnam and ZipSam."7i Compare also with the names: Bagam, from the house of Vahuni; ArSam, king of Dzopk'-Kommagene; Argam, etc. These examples prove beyond doubt that in the name Ar-am, -am is a suffix and that the root Ar belongs to thai series of place and tribal names original to the Armenian Highland, all of which contain the component Ar (Ara) as their initial element.

Gelb sees in these words the roots ar and musV andt with reason, he does not consider them Semitic. Though he calls (hem Human, we are inclined to call them Subarian- In the compound name A-ra am-mu-su-m, it is possible to sec two different structures or modes of compounding: one is Aram-musu-ni, where the second component is mus or mus. as accepted by Gelb, and the other is

Compare this with Da-Su-uk and (/a-su-u/c, the names of a Subarian man and a man of Nuxi, respectively,74 In our opinion, regardless of which of the muS or su (-subari) form is correct, they both belong to the group of names of the Subarian region of the Armenian Highland, with which, as it is obvious, is directly related the first component Aram of this name. The southern (particularly the southwestern) regions of the Armenian Highland, being in direct contact with Sumero-Akkadians,
have also been called Ar-me (- Ara-me) with the Sumc

been called Arwrn (4the Ars?) with -im, Ihe Semitic suf

tern region of the Armenian Highland was called Armc (or by a name of similar form). The reason for this view is that the Assyro-Babylonian world has come into coniacl with the Armenian Highland mainly through (his neigboring region. The fact is, however, that there were many other regions in (he Armenian Highland, including the central regions, that had names formed with the component Ar or Ara, such as Aramali/ArmafriJIi (= Armani, because li=ni for plural). Arberani, Arjji, Eriafji, Aragadz. etc. These will be discussed in detail in the next chapter. It is also necessary to relate to these names all the proper nouns occuring in the inscriptions of the third and second milleniums B.C. that are formed by (he components Ar and Ara or by (heir variants Ari and Aru. Such personal names are: Ari-a, Ari-kummc, Ari-Sen,

30 ARMENIA, SUBARTU AND SUMER
It is inicrcsling lo noic thai in the times of the archives of Ebla there existed a city called Arat one of whose inhabitants, by the name Ippihir, had received supplies from Ebla.12
Long before the arrival of the Semites (who were later called AramaeansK the Ars of the Armenian Highland were spread out in the neighboring south* in the plains of Northern Syria and Northern Mesopotamia. certain parts of which were known as >4Armcnian Mesopo*
tamia"
. This is how, as we have seen, in the time of Adad-Nirari II,
Arime** became to include, other than the southwestern regions of the Armenian Highland, these flatlands as well, which, in ancient limes, were part of the southern regions of the Indo-European homeland (sec Map 6)- It was during the decline and downfall of Mitanni that the Semitic nomadic tribes, Suli and Atjiami, came and settled in certain areas of this region and were called Aramaeans after the name Aram (Arma) of the country. It must be accepted, therefore,
thai the Armens did not receive their name from the Aramaeans; on
the contrary, these nomadic t
r
ibes who came to inhabit the land of 4rma or Aram (derived from the name Ar or Ara of the Armens) were called Aramaeans after the name of the land in which they
settled.
These southern regions of the Armenian Highland and the northern regions of Syria and Mesopotamia were belter known to Sumero-Akkadians by the name Subir/Subartu. It was much later and only long after the fall of the powerful state of Mitanni thai the large country of Subari began to shrink and maintained her existence confined just to the Aghtznik'-Sasun region under the name of Subria, which continued to be called also by the names Arme and Urme (Utmcu(fi) in the inscriptions of the Assyrian and Urartian
kings. In addition to the cuneiform inscriptions mentioned above, the
ancient Armenian literature also contains a number of references
pointing out that Armc-Subria (certain regions of which have been called Supani>D70pkt and others Alzinini>Aghtznik') has been one of Ihe oldest and most important centers of the homeland of the Armen people. One may ask, was it coincidental that Argrtti I settled the 6600

warriors brought from yaie and Supani in Ercbuni? We know that the natives of Aghtznik* (Alzi) and Dzopk' (Supani) have often
entered into the so-called Hittite alliance and were also called the Hate
warriors. It follows that the expression "warriors from yate and Supani" refers to the natives of Aghtznik' and Dzopk'. We do not think, therefore, that Ihe relocation of these 6600 warriors by ArgiUti in his newly constructed Erebuni fortress was incidental.
ArgiSli built the strong fortress of Erebuni ("for the glory of the land ofBiaina and to the horror of his enemies") for the purpose of defending the eastern regions of his country against the intrusions of enemies and also to use it as a military base for his future expansions. It would have been logical for him, therefore, to station there, as his garrison, troops who would be more faithful and reliable. Thus, we see him moving there men from "yate" and Dzopk', whom he calls warriors, and not slaves, the implication being that they were co-tribal
Nairian Armens.
In a similar vein, we think that the choice of Aghtznik* by Tigran the Great as the location to build his new capital Tigranakert was not incidental. A certain motive and, very likely, national traditions must have guided him in making this choice. It is true that he abandoned the old capital Anashat mainly because the westward expansion of his empire left the capital almost at the eastern extremity of the country;
also in order to facilitate the administrative links with the various
regions of the empire it was necessary to move the capital to a more central location and particularly closer lo the contemporary centers of Hellenistic civilization. He could have certainly chosen a more suitable site of stronger strategic position. There is no doubt that his choice of Aghtznik' was dictated by nationalistic feelings and national traditions, assuring him that as part of the sacred Armenian fatherland, it provided a more genuine and reliable environment.
We would like here to draw our readers' attention to an impor
tant point which has been generally overlooked by those who specialize in the ancient history of the Armenian people. A careful study of the map will show that the vast expanses of land in the south which Tigran the Great annexed to his kingdom are almost ihe same as those territories that formerly comprised the countries of Subartu and Mitanni. The same can be said for his western expansions: they, too, coincide with those regions which were inhabited by Armenians and which in the second and first milleniums B.C. were called Hayasa, Pahhuwa, Suhmu, Tegarama, Isuwa.

The conclusion is, therefore, that Tigran the Great was not an agressor occupying foreign lands, but a great national hero who reunited the traditional SubarianMitannian-Armcnian lands into his kingdom. In this connection we would like to present here, for comparison, some of the characteristic features of the seal of Saussatar, king of Milanni (1450 B.C.). and those of Tigran the Great's crown.

The same feaiures appear on Tigran's crown, with Ihe same solar disk and the two eagles, one on each side, and Ihe crown itself shaped at the top like spikes representing the rays of the sun. The similarities arc too obvious to be explained away by mere coincidence, It is known that, according to certain scholars, the city of Urfa (Edcssa; Orrboe for Greeks, Urhoi for Syrians), located in the south of Arme-Subria and a short distance north of Harran. was. at a certain time in history, an important Hurrian center, maybe even a capital, and that the name Orrhoe (called Urha by Khorenatsi) has perhaps originated from the name Hurri.84
84. CHHM. 58-59.



ARMANI 33
Furthermore, Faustus Buzand has preserved the following valuable record about the city of Urha of the Hurrians: "King Pap lof Armenians] ...has sent messengers to the king of the Greeks saying: 'Caesarea and the other ten cities ha ve belonged to us: Give them back. The city of Urha also was built by our ancesters. therefore, if you do not desire that troubles arise, give it back, otherwise we shall fight a great war."" Whether these words of the king constiluled a historical record or a mere tradition, is immaterial. They only show, with certainly, that in the time of Fausius Buzand it was still remembered thai the city of Urha was built by the ancestors of the Armens.
We already know that Urha was in that part of Subartu which coincided in the past with the southwestern regions of the land of
Armani.
These main regions of Subartu included the basins of the headstreams of the Tigris and the two Khaburs that descend from the Armenian Highland. It must be noted that in Sumcro-Akkadian writings (specially in the syllabaries) the names Subari and Khubur are given as synonymous terms.*6 Since in the past the Khabur river and its name have been closely connected with the lives of the Armen people in the region of Armani. it would be expected that this name should have been preserved in their language in one form or another. In fact, we think it very probable that the word uiqpJupT aghbiur ('source, fountain*) in Armenian retains the memory of the Khabur river and its sources.
H
. Adjarian in his Armatakan Bararan (Armenian Etymological Dictionary), following Hiibschmann. supposes thai the word aghbiur comes from the Indo-European brew, and makes the following comparison:
Gr. ypiab ('well, cistern'): Homeric Or. q)pe(aTa =

('fountain') which, according to Karolides, is borrowed from ihe
Armenian.
Then Adjarian adds: 44From the weak grade of Indo-European protoforms have originated the Golhic brunna, the Old High German brunno, the Anglo-Saxon burna* the German Brunncn ('fountain*). All these are derived from the simple Indo-European root-word bhreu
(
'to boil, to bubble, to fcrmcnt,)-,> Following this Adjarian cites all the European "heirs" of this Indo-European roots. As we see it clearly, they had to invent first an Indo-European protoform (supposedly Wirevf), they had to go through a tortuous and labyrinthine way of "dissimilation, transposition, and addition" in order to arrive, from the artificial form bhrevr at the Armenian word aghbevr-aghbiur. We think, it is highly probable, that the word mqpjiup, agbbiur (in Tiflis: luqpmp, aghbur, mfupntp akbpur; in Constantinople: ui|upnLp, akhbur; in Garin, Hamshen, Nor-Jugha, Sebastia: uijup'tiLp, akbb'ur; in Akhallskha, Yerevan, Shamakhi: mluujnLp, akhpur; in Rodosto: ui[ui|mip, akhp'ur; in Alashkert, Mush: juijup'tiip, yakhb'ur; etc.) is linked with the name of the Khabur river, which, with the transition kba>akb> has become akhbur>aghbevr (aghbiur).
We also think it very likely (particularly having in view that the homeland of the Proto-Indo-European language was in ihe Armenian Highland and the neighboring regions of Asia Minor) that the Golhic brunna* the Old High German brunno, the Anglo-Saxon burna, and the German Brunnen ("fountain*) and other similar words reflect the memory of the name Buranun*1 the old Subarian name (preserved in Sumerian) of the Euphrates River. We can link with
this the Greek word (pp6a6 (4well, cistern*) and the forms
(ppefaxa <ppT]aTa of Homer that remind us of the Mcsopotamian-Akkadian form purattu** (>Furaf, Euphrates) encountered in cuneiform writings. All these, as will be seen in the last chapter, can be considered as another indication regarding the location of the homeland of the parent Indo-European language and the connection between the Subarians and Indo-Europeans. If these observations of ours arc right, it can then be accepted that the tribes speaking the Proto-Armenian language (at the time of

ARMANI 35
the formaiion of the word aghbur-aghbfur in their language) have spread also to the south of the Armenian Highland, to the regions of the sources of the Khabur river. It was through these regions that ihey have come in contact with the Sumero-Akkadians. And as we have noted, these very regions were called Hark* (Harki) by AdadNirari II, as was the region above Lake Van. Furthermore, those European peoples who have in their language the forms brunna, brumio, brunncn ( = Buranum) and vpt ata (= Furat-Euphrates) meaning *spring' or 'fountain', must have lived in the neighborhood of the Armenian Highland in Asia Minor (toward west from the Euphrates), It would not be unexpected that in the days of Naram-Sin. Armani could have spread out 10 the main indicated regions of Subari and established there a city-center by Ihe name Armani, In later limes, the southern regions of this land of Armani have been called Ar/mc, "land of Ars", by Adad Nirari IL It is possible to accept, therefore,
ihai the name Armani is the earliest known form and record of ihe
Armcn people and their land, called variously Ar/mc, Armc, Urme (Urmcukhi), Armina, Armeni or Armen. In the course of our recent investigations we have come across a number of concrete and important data which tend to establish the link between Subari and Armani* Before presenting these, however, we think it is csscmial to give our version of the etymology of the name
Subari.
5
. THE SU PEOPLE
The Akkadian forms of the name Subari were S/Subarit S/Subaru and S/Subarfu (with an initial sound of either sh or s), whereas the main Sumerian form was Subir. It is this latter name that must
be accepted as its original form. As revealed by our recent studies, in the name Su-b/r, the bir component means 4lribe, race, people'
. It also means ouse, city, land', because in ancient times tribes or races and the land on which
they lived were both designated in general by the same name. For example, Hayk* and Virk* meant *Armenians' and Georgians',



36 ARMENIA. SUBARTU AND SUMER
respectively, and at the same time they also meant 'the land of Armenians' (Armenia) and 'the land of Georgians' (Georgia). Cf. «i|uiTiifbuij muiGbO*89 (Kadmeay tanen) ("from the house of Kad
mos" or "from the tribe of Kadmos"). « . ""itb »nTMGD P'np
cjnifuij*90 (azgi tann Torkomay) ("from the household of Torgom", etc.). The same meaning was expressed by the Semitic word bit, which meant 'house' and also 'family, tribe' (cf. B/f-Zaman/,91 Bit-Agusi,92 etc.) as the Arabic beyt ('house, family'). Academician G. Ghapantsian had already pointed out with great discernment that the word bir (or its variant ber) means 'tribe.
race'
. He writes:
The inscriptions of Tiglath-Pileser 1 mention the name Sinibirani in the land of Nairi, a name which, in our opinion,
means the 'Sin tribes*
. Also there is mention, by SamSi
Adad IV, of the Nairian land of Ginzibir, which has un
doubtedly meant the 'Ginzi tribe'. Compare with Etiuni Ibirani, Sinibirani, Ginzibir, and other combinations, and with such ancient Armenian place-names as Taruberan (Turuberan), Arberani 01 Arberan, which literally meant the 'Taurtribes' (=Armenian Taurus) and the 'Ar-l ibes 9,
In short, Ghapantsian finds that the bir component in the names Ginzi-bir and Sini-bir-ani, and the ber component in Turu-ber-an
and Ar-bcr-ani means 'tribe'.94
Similarly. Su-b/r meant the 'Su tribe' or 'the land of the 5u tribe'.
The Nairian names Ginzi-b/r, Sini-bi'r-ni. Turu-ber-an Ar-bcr-ani
show that this word bir (>ber) pertains to the Nairian tribes and thus it becomes clear that there has been a link between the Nairian
people and the Subarians who carried the name Su-bir (i.e. the 'Su-t
r
ibc').*5

A confession made by Sargon of Akkad reveals thai Akkad was not his home or birthplace, therefore he was not the legal heir to the Akkadian throne; he was a usurper. In one of his inscriptions he openly says this about himself: .My mother was humble, 1 knew not my father. My father's brother was a

The word bir has passed lo Assyro-Babylonians and become Wr-fu, meaning 'fortress', which in turn, is reflected in the Armenian pbpr|, herd ('fortress*). In Sumerian there is also the word bar, which means 'dwelling place, family9. The Sumerians have already used the name Subir also in ihe form of Subar96 (from which have originated the Akkadian Sudan"
, Subaru or Subartu). The Sanskrit vara means 'land** in Kurdish var 'dwelling place*, in Hittite bir 'house**97 and in Persian ber 'land*.

'lent, a dwelling place made with wooden poles and coarse canvass'), which probably comes from the form ibirani of the Urartian inscriptions that must have meant 'houses' or 'tribes' (although M. Dzcreteli and Melikishvili (following the former) have, with some doubt (and
erroneously), given this word the meaning of 'totally*).99 We know that in Urartian and ce
r
tain other ancient languages, the sound b9 when occurring in the beginning of a word or between two vowels, changes to v in Armenian (cf. Bjaina>Va/i, Erebuni>Erevan). Therefore,
dwelltr in the mountain. My town was Azupirani lhat is set on the bank of ihe Euphrates/' (Regarding this inscription, see Seton Lloyd, Twin Rivers, Oxford 1943, p* 31.) The -ani ending of the city name Azubirani is clearly Subarian-Hurrian, and the bir ('t
r
ibe*) component shows that this city belonged lo the Nai
r
ian Azu (possibly <SU) tribe. In Nairi there was the Azu mountain, which Tiglath-Pileser I mentions in connection with an invasion that he carried out against the land of Haria-Khabkhi (see ARAB,
78-79). The composition of the name Azu-bir-ani already shows that it belongs
to the same group of Subarian-Nairian names, such as, Sim bir Ar-bcr-anit Turu-bcr-anO), Ginzi-bir, and Su-bir. Since Sargon's uncle was a mountain dweller, in whose care he must have grown up (since he did not know his father), therefore this city must have been located in thai region of the Euphrates where it
f
lows through the Subari mountains (the Kashiari and the western ranges of Ihe Armenian Taurus). At any raict one thing is clear that Sargon's birthplace was a Subarian-Nairian city.

the ibir-ani (ibirani)>vr-an (vran) iransilion is- highly probable. As for the -ani>-an iransilion. compare with Urartian ebani>ujiiufi (avan) 'country town*. The / of the root-word bir in ibir-ani is dropped in Armenian because of the addition of the suffix -an (ani). The same thing has happened also in the transition of Su-bir>Su-br-ia (Subria) because of the addition of the toponymic suffix -/a. We can accept, therefore, that Su-bir means the 'Su tribe" or the 'land of the
Su t
r
ibe'.100 In Sumero-Akkadian Ur III and other inscriptions the logogram SU.A often appears in place of the term Su-Wr (or Su-bur). Scholars who have investigated this phenomenon have accepted the SU.A =SU.BIR (Subir) equivalence, but it has not been very clear for them as to why bir was substituted by A. Now that we know bir
means 'tribe'. A, too, must have an equivalent meaning in this case,
Deimel's dictionary has: Sumer. a= Jf, Akkad. BAND. Ger. erzeu
gen; = Akkad. RIHUTU, Ger. Erzei«un ; = Akkad. APLU. Ger. So/Tn; = Akkad. MARU. Ger. Sohn, Kind. It is clear now why SU.A
(
'offspring of Su* or 'sons of Su') is written instead of SU.BIR ('the Su tribe* or 'of the Su tribe*).
In conclusion, we can say with certainty that the real tribal name of the Subarians was Su (or Su, as a phonetic variant). The noted Orientalist-Sumerologist Ignace J. Gelb, in his book Hurrians and Subarians, brings numerous examples demonstrating that in the ancient Sumero-Akkadian inscriptions the Subarians were very often called Su and their country SuKl and SubirK1. He writes: "Certain common nouns and divine names are distinguished by a notation SU, SUKI. SU.BIRKI. or ina Su-ba-ri. In these texts all these expres
sions can have but one meaning: "in Subartu" or "in the land ofSuba
rians.'*101 He explicitly states: "It is obvious that the notations SVKl. SU.BIRKI and ina Su-ba-ri are synonymous.102 These statements pro
vide direct and concrete evidence that Subarians were called Su, and
that the etymology we suggested for the word Su-bir is correct. Some authors, igno
r
ing that the name Su-bir means the 'Su tribe'
or the 'land of the Su tribe*
, have thought of seeing in Su an abbreviation of SuWr. However, the very presence of the tribal name Su in the name Su-bir refutes their view and confirms the idea that

those people were in effecl called Su. For additional proof, we can cite, as one example, the name of the city of Sura10' (containing likewise the tribal name Su or Su), that was located in the land of Hanigalbat, in the main Subarian homeland, and, as another example. the name Su-Su-uk10* of a man of Subari, (where the syllabe Su is
repeated, like in Hotfyoruni, and other names where the root component is similarly repeated). Compare the -ra ending of the name Su-ra with the place names Bidara, Sabarra, Sirara,m and with the personal names SaHuara, ArtaSSumara, and Ewar/'
- /ra.106 Compare also the personal name Su-Su-uk with Su-su-Au,'07 the name of a city in Uruatri; Da-Su-uk. the name of a man of Subari, l1a-Su-ukm,
Ihe name of a man of Nuzi; and the Nuzian personal names Kaltuk, Kizzuk, Naharuk. and Nizuk, all of which have the ending -u*:.109 Some authors assert that the term SuKI (=Subarlu) has in later
periods often indicated Assyria, and that the appellation su has been given to those people who carried non-Subarian names. This is plausible. The Subarians were spread over the entire expanse of Assyria before the Semites appeared on the scene and at that time all of Assyria was within the boundaries of their country. Later on, after (he middle of the third mlllenium B.C., when Assyria emerged as a distinct country with the rise in power of the city of ASSur, the tradition of referring to her often by the term Subartu might have continued in texts of later periods. Certainly it is not unusual for some Subarians to have carried non-Subarian names. It is not impossible either, that those names that are mentioned under the name su and are considered
non-Subarian, could have been in fact of Subarian origin. Therefore. all those who have been definitely called "men of Su" have in reality been Subarian. "Ungnad reasoned out that since in late Assyrian syllabaries SU1*"* stands for SU.BIR1", then all persons called thus in the Ur III tablets must be considered Subarian."'10

. ARMANI AND THE NAME OF HER KING
I
. Gclb provides us with a valuable ancient cuneiform icsiimony thai proves lo be most important for our topic under study. In his
book Humans and Suba
r
ians, in the chapter entitled Suba
r
ian Personal Names of the Ur III Period and the First Dynasty of Babylon, he lists a number of names that belonged to ihe Subarian people of Ihe Ur [II period, among which there is one particular personal name, Madatina (Madakina)f by which the king of Armani
was called in the time of Naram-Sin. Here are the names menlioned
by Gelb:
animals offered by Ki-ma-ni, Si-ni-niy Ku-zu-zu, the messenger of Ba-ar-ba-ra-gi, Ad-da-bu-ni the messenger of Seeb-ba, Se-bi the messenger of Ra-Si, Ma-da-fj-na, and flu-u/ba-at and presumably by another man whose name is omitted, followed by the term /u SU-me. lu SU-me means "they arc
(or *lwho are SU'* and evidently de
f
ines the preceding group as SU people.111
This statement explicitly proves that Madatina as mentioned here was a man of Su (=Suban). Examining one by one the Subarian names mentioned in this inscription, Gelb writes the following about Madatina:
in a Hittiie tale from Bogazkby describing a war of Naram-Sin against a coalition of seventeen kings a certain Ma-da-di!-na, king of Ar-ma-n/, is menlioned. All the schol
ars who have worked on this text have read the name of this
king as Ma-da-ki-na, in spite of the fact that the copy by
H
. Figulla suggests the reading Ma-da-di-na instead,"*
The name Madatina (Madadina) occurs again in the Resume of the chapter where Gclb offers a summary of the 29 Subarian names
examined.
Here we wish to draw the particular attention of scholars who desire to study the national identity of Armani to this very important
111. Ibid., 100-101. 112. Ibid.. 103.

fact, thai in the time of Naram-Sin, Madadina (Madakina)t the king
of Armani, had a Subarian name, that is, he was a "man of Suba
r
i
"
and, consequently, he belonged to (he Subarian and not the Semitic people. In addition to this inscription that testifies to Madadina*s being Subarian, there is also the fact, that the ending na of the name Mada
dina (Madakina) is not Semitic and it belongs to the series of Suba
r
ianMitannian-Nairian names of similar ending. Compare the following personal names: Suttama (king of Mitanni), Erimena (king of Urartu), Urzana (king of Musasir), Hukkana (king of HayasaK Datana (king of yupuikia),113 Tilusina (king of Andia), Suna (Uranian governor),114 This last name Su-na is interesting also because of its root su (= Subari). 1 would like to present here a very important point showing in a concrete way that the people of the land of Arma{-m) (the Armens) were Su (- Subarian), It is known that Sargon 11 calls the region in
the northeast of Lake Van (the Ardjesh region) Armarili (Arma
r
ili)9 whereas ArgiSti U, in one of his inscriptions left in the Ardjesh area.
calls this very same region Su
r
ili tSu-rili). What was called Arma
r
ili by Sargon the foreigner is synonymous to Su*ri7i, the name given by ArgiSti the native. Here it is very clearly seen that in these two terms the -ri/j component is a derivative suffix, possibly a compound suffix (-r/-//), where the part -ri reminds us of the endings of such names
as KaSia-n, Nam-ri, yur
r
i, Kirru-ri, Meb-W» etc., having probably the meaning *-ian*
f and the part which is the known plural suffix: cf. Biaini-//, ArgiStitiini-//, Darana-//, Manana-//, and other similar
forms. It is evident, therefore, that the terms Arma (= Arma-ni) and
Su ( = Subari) occurring in these two names are equivalent terms and designate the same people. This is an important and concrete proof showing that the Armens were also called Subarians, or that Subanu was also called Armani. Tiglath-Pileser lvs following statement, already quoted above in Section 4t provides another important testimony proving the same point: |imo] the midst of Akhlami, the men of Arma. I marched. From Su- i to the city of Carchemish. in (he land of Haitc, in one day I raided ..." Here it is seen clearly that the area of the land of Arma is called Su hi land ("the land
of the Su"), that is, "Suba
r
ian land." This, too, is a direct and
concrete evidence that the land of Arma (Armani) was Suba
r
ian.

Thus i( becomes understandable now that Arman(um) (Armani) racnlioned by Naram-Sin was in the land of Subartu. It is not incidental, therefore, that later on the region of Subha was also called
Arme.
It was pointed out at the beginning of this study that in NaramSin's Akkadian inscritpion the name Arman(um) was derived from
the form Armani (by the deletion of / in the Akkadian de
r
ivative form Armam'-um) which appears unchanged in the known Hittite inscription that speaks about Naram-Sin.
The name Armani (Arma-ni), by virtue of its very suf
f
ix -ni, is not Semitic either; it belongs to the group of Subarian-Nairian names of similar ending, such as Mitanni. 3upani, Daiaeni, Amadani, Alzini
(Alzinini), Ni
f
yani, etc. This -ni (and -na) ending indicates a plural form which is also a toponymic suffix, as is the suf
f
ix f (k') in Armenian.
In later times, this -ni ending was in many cases substituted by the plural and toponymic suffix f (k*).1" (Cf. $upani opk', Daiani>Tayk', etc.) This plural ending -ni exists in the Armenian language. Acade
mician Ararat Gharibian writes:
The plural ending -an is used quite extensively in Armenian dialects. For example: fi mG (ishan. 'asses"). AbuiQ {tzian, 'horses') in the subdialcct of Bayazet; tnbqiuQ (teghan 'beds') in the dialect of Sebastia. We have the plural ending -ani, such
as in mp mQ}! (u
r
is/iani 'others') in the dialect of Djugha; wc
f
ind the plural form -eni in the regions of Shamshadin and Gharabagh. like l|ui\nnutG|i (katueni, 'cats*), ... and
almost in all dialects we
f
ind the plural form -ner which is a compound plural, the combination of two plural suffixes n and er. In the dialect of Constantinople -ni is a plural
ending, such as in npfhpGfiu {grk'emis, 'our books'), and
in (he dialect of Gharabagh the same plural is formed by -ne, like in BnnngQt idjsghatsne, 'mills')."*
115. I consider it very likely that the Armenian plural luffix t (k*) comes from the determinative */, meaning 'place' or 'locality' put at the end of place names in Sumcro-Akkadian inscriptioDs. For insiancc. if the term
Parsua (Pariuaf, BarSua) linked with the name Fan (Persian), then (he Parsuakt-Parsk' ( upuf) equivalence provides a good example, where f (k1) corresponds lo ki. which, having a toponymic value, as a sign of collectivity has also acquired the meaning of plurality. 116. HB. 137.



ARMANI 43
Transitions such as$upani>$opk'f Alzinini>Aghtzniki (tTmmuiQ ljniiif, UmliGfiG UqaDtif) and the like show that first
(he form -ni was used, then the form k* if) . This becomes obvious
in compound plurals, such as, nQ + f, on+ic' (ifbp-nQf, mcr-onk\ 'ours*), nuQ + f, un+k* (quiLuiljnLOfT zavak~unk't 'children* ifmu-nLGf, nias-uii*:\ 'relics')* hC + f, in+k* ( n-fiGf, ler-ink' 4moumains,)i mG + f, an + k' (inbq-mGf, tegh-ank** 'places*), etc., where plurals were formed first by the suffixes on, iinf in, an, and later, as the strength of these plurals was lost or weakened, a second suffix k' (f) was added, just as it has occurred in the case of f+bp, k'+er, examples of which are, 6bn.>6bn.f >6biifbp (tzer>tzcrk'>tz€rk*er, 'hands'), nin>nmf>nmfbp (vor>vofl:4>
votk'er, "feet*), etc. All these examples suggest once again that the ending m in Armani charcterizes (he name as belonging (o the Subarian-Nairian group, and that it should be accepted as such, In the Near East there was a storm-god that was called Adad by the Semitic peoples and TeSub by the Subarian-Hurrian-Nairian peoples. This deity is often represented in cuneiform inscriptions by the ideogram IM which can be read either as Adad or as TeSub, depending on the context- As we have seen above, according to Naram-Sin's known Akkadian inscription, at the lime of one of his invasions against Armani, RiS~Tc§ub was the king of that country, Considering that (his text was Akkadian and also assuming thai Armani was Semitic, the earlier translators of this inscription have read the second component of this king's name, the ideogram IM, as Adad in the Semitic*Akkadian form, instead of reading it as TeSub. In our previous works we have mentioned this name in the form Red-TcSub. Gelb has shown, however, that the first component of the name of this king should be read as RiS (RMS) and not as Rid (Ri-id).117 Threrefore this king was called RiS-TcSub.
117. HS, 103- The name Ri§ua(-ini) of the land near Lake Sevaiip mentioned by Rusa I of Urartu, is not Semitic, hence it is difficult to accept that the (almost homophonic) component ifii of the royal name RiS-Teiub could be Semitic in origin. In any case, the compound noun Rii*TcSub could not have been the name of a Scmilc. Cf- the royal name Igni-lieba of Ebla which, likewise, must not be taken for the name of a Semite. 118- That the Hurriam have come to Mesopotamia and the Armenian Highland in the beginning of the second millcnium, was an accepted viewpoint in scholarship. In recent years, however, a number of Human divine names have been revealed in the records of Ebla (see AEt 251 and Ebla, 165),



44 ARMENIA. SUBARTU AND SUMER
ll is already known that in the third, second, and first millcniums
B
.C. certain individuals and kings of some of the Subarian-HumanNairian kingdoms carried names that contained Ihe TcSub component. For example, Te§up«SeIah is mentioned in the UR III period, and Ehli-Te§up, a man from Ebla, is mentioned in Alalakh IV (15lh century B.C.), also at the time of Tiglath-Pileser (I I14-1076 B.C) the king of Katmuhi was called Kili-TcSub, the son of Kali-TeSub. In about the same time, the king of ihe Ura inaS fortress in the north bank of the Aradzani river was called Sad/-Te5ub, and in ihe days of Esarhaddon (680-669 B,C.) the king of Subria bore the name Inip-TcSub* etc.119 Thus, we see that the ihronc of Armani was occupied at one time by a king who was called by the Subarian (su) name Madatina (Madakina) and at another lime by a king who was called by the SubarianHurrian-Nairian name RiS-TeSub (derived from the divine name Te§ub). This very important observation, together with the analysis of the -m and -na suffixes of the names Armani and Madatina provide also concrete indications that the land and the kingdom of Armani belonged not to the Semitic, but to the Subarian-Nairian circle,
Therefore, the name Armanj must be considered as the earliest form
of Armenia
A further proof for the Nairian origin of Ihe name ArmaOni) is provided by the etymology of Armavir (<Arma-bir). More will be said about this in Chapter 4.
The name Armani, as the oldest form of the name of the
Armenian homeland, has filtered down from ancient Chaldaean
records and old Armenian traditions and is well preserved in ancient Armenian literature. It is known that the personal name Armenak
comes from the ethnic name Armcn of ihe Armenians or from the
name Armcni of their country. Armcni is the form used by the
Greeks. Darius calls it Armina. The oldest forms of the name Armc
naA, as the eponym of the Armenian people or land, are retained in the works of Khorenaisi. Sebeos, M. Ayrivanelsi, Samuel Anetsi,
showing that either the Hurrians were already m existence in Mesopotamia in the time of Ebia writings (middle of third millcnum B.C.) and even before, or having come later, ihey had adopted or appropriated certain local deities. For example, in the records of Ebla wc find the divine namcSamagaru that reminds us of the presumably Hurrian sun-god Simige, and also Samai (about Samagan* see AEt 254). We shall speak about this in detail in the section The Principal Cods of Urartu. 119. HS, 47, 83,



ARMANI 45

AramaneaJf120 or in ils older form Armancak that is preserved ihe
name of ihe Armenian homeland. Armani.
The personal name Armaneak, as an eponym. is formed by adding
the suffix -ak 10 ihe name Armam(cf. Haykak, Tsolak. Paylak, elc). According to Armenian linguislic rules, when Ihe suffix -ak is added, ihe / ending of Armani changes to c, and ArmanZ-ak becomes Armaneak, such as paiani-paianeak ('youih'). aghavni-aghavneak
(
'pigeon'), etc. This is anoiher proof that the name of the Armenian land in the form Armani did exist and was well known among Armenians. This name pertained to the Armenians and was not
Semitic.
The Arabs, who are the heirs of the Assyro-Babylonians, continue to call the Armenians Armani ( "ji) to the present day. This is already a living testimony to all thai has been said above. As to the origin and meaning of the name Armam, although we have given detailed explanations about them in our previous works, we consider it necessary to reiterate here some of the highlights because of the importance they have for the study of our present topic.

Chapter 2
ARA'S LAND AND PEOPLE
1
. THE GOD AR (OR ARA)
It has been shown by some Orienlalist-Armenologists (and also in our previous works) in a number of quotations of mythological and historical data that the native peoples of the Armenian Highland and the neighboring regions of Asia Minor had, in the earlier periods of paganism, a deity whom they called Ar or Ara. In the primitive hunting stage of the life of these natives, the god Ara possessed animal-vegetal characteristics. Later, with the beginning of agriculture, he acquired a vegetal-solar nature and with the development of irrigation in agriculture and the consolidation of statehood, he became a great war-god and was identified with the sun. This process of change from primitive to complex characteristics. as manifested in the nature of Ar (or Ara), is by no means unique in the mythological history of mankind. It has had its close parallels. For example, the god ASSur, in the earlier periods of the founding of the city of ASSur, had a vegetal (peaceful) nature,1 but later on, when Assyria became a mighty empire by bloody expeditions, it turned into a fearsome deity and was identified with the sun. Research has revealed that in the remote past Ar (or Ara) was the principal national deity of the Armen people.
H
. Matikian, N. Adontz, M. Abeghian. G. Ghapantsian, and other Armenologists accept that Ara was the native deity of the
Armenians.
The known Orientalist A.H. Sayce states that Ar was the sungod of the Armenians. In his words: "... if is better to suppose thai Er. or Ara, was an Armenian name for the Sun-god, which in later times was confounded with Arios (Nergal) of Ktesias.'*1 In this connection H. Matikian writes: "To study Ara the Beautiful means to make inroads into the obscure centuries of the origin of the Armenian people and to examine them.",

ARA S LAND AND PfcOPLE 47
Wc do not ihink it is necessary here lo delve further into ihc nature of Ara, because we have already treated this topic at great length in our previous works and have shown with numerous evidences that Ara was the native and national deity of the Armenians. However, because of the importance it bears upon the subject under study, wc think it will be helpful to mention here some facts related to the formation and the meaning of the national name Armani of Armenians which is closely linked lo Ara. It is known in historiography and archaeology that the names of many ancient peoples have been related to the names of their principal deities* In the remote past, each tribe, even each household, had its own totem, its object of worship, or its god. With the increasing of the household or the tribe in size and in strength, its god has correspondingly acquired greater significance and power. We learn from cuneiform inscriptions that battles waged between tribes and stales have been fought mostly for and in the name of the gods of the fighting sides. In many cases tribes and states were distinguished from each other by the names of their gods. In the same way have originated also ihc names of many habitations and countries. Because of intertribal wars, a given tribe was forced to fortify a central area on its territory where it kept its sacred totem in safety or established lhe throne (or the temple) of its god, from whom that
particular place de
r
ived, subsequently, its name. Laier on, as ihc tribe has grown and spread out, that fortified habitation has become an administrative and economic center, and still later the capital. Very often we read in cuneiform writings thai a certain king has defeated the king of the land of a certain city. Wc have seen statements of this kind in Ihe well-known Hittite inscription about NaramSin, where among his 17 enemies there is one mentioned as "MadattOMf the king of the land of the city of Armani." This shows clearly that the country of a tribe or a slate could have derived its name from the name of its central or royal dty, which, in many cases, bore the name of the principal god of that particular tribe or people, This is how have originated, for example, the names of the great Assyrian and Roman empires, which were originally the names of the central cities, ASSur and Rome, of the given tribes, and where each tribe had established its own object of worship, ASSur and Romulus, respectively. The same is true also about the Greeks who call them* selves Hellenes and their country Hellada (Hellas) after the name of their god Hellenos.



48 ARMENIA, SUBARTU AND SUMER
Dr, H. Malikian wriies: '4T/ie history of cUch nation has begun with a mythological worldview ,? An Armenian historian should never lose sight of this point; herein lies the Gordian knot of our history*." And Dr, G. Conlcneau has ihis to say; "In remote antiquity no difference was made between a country and its gods/* ("La haute anliquite ne faisait pas de difference entre un pays et ses dieux.11)5 In view of all these considerations, one would expect that the name Armani or Armeni that represents one of the most ancient peoples
and the tribal unions of Western Asia should have been derived from
the name of (he principal deity of that tribe or people. And indeed, as we have seen, the name of that principal national deity was
Ar or Ara.
2
. THE MEANING OF THE NAME ARMANI
We find thai the word Ar-ma-n/ is a compound noun, where the first component Ar is none other than the name of the national sun-god of the Armens, and the second component ma (me a varient) signifies build, make, beget, offspring, son'. Ma, with this meaning, was known to many peoples of the Near East in antiquity. The goddess of birth and fertility, so well known in Asia Minor, was called by this very same name Ma-6 This root-word (and also its variant me) is found also in the Sumerian language with the same meaning.7 It results that Ar-ma (and its variant Ar-me) means 4buill by Ar, born of Ar', or Ar's offspring', *Ar's/Ara's son' (*lhe son of the sun', Unbi-nnnh), The ending -n/1* of Arma-ni (or Arme-ni),
4
. Ibid., 1-2. 5
. CHHM, 75. 6
. Ma also occurs in its reduplicated form Mams (or Mami) in Assyro-Babylonian inscriptions (sec CE, 259),
7
. SAG, see ma = Akkad. BANU {''to build, to engender"), me = Akkad. BANU (German "crzeugen") "to bcgciM. SccalsoSGC, 227, where Sumcr. Ma = Beget,
build. See also ACS, 92, where Sumer, Mi = French "crier/etrc cr6c/' 8
. The plural-forming or toponymic suffix -ni is found in Subarian-Hurrian-Nairian place and tribal names. We find the plural form ni also in Armenian, as already discussed earlier in detail. It is not unlikely that those of the third millenium
B
.C. could have Sumerian origin derived from the plural form -e-ne reserved for persons.



ARA S LAND AND PEOPLfc
as has been mcmioned earlier, is a plural and toponymic suf
f
ix (cf. Mitanni. Supani. Alzini (Alzinini), Daiaeni. Nijjani, etc.). Hence Armani (or Armeni) means 'sons of Ar', thai is, 'sons of the sun' or 'ihc land of the sons of Ar'. which is literally 'the land of the sons
of the sun'
. A similar case is seen in the Armenian words Hayk'
and Virk' (imjf, pf) which, by virtue of the plural-forming
suffix k' (f) mean, respectively, 'Armenians' and 'Georgians' and
also 'the land of Armenians (Armenia)' and 'the land of Georgians
(Georgia)'. Just as the name Arma-m appears simply as Arma, without the suffix -m, in the Alalakh inscriptions, so does it in the form Arme in the Assyrian and Urartian writings. Since, as it was mentioned above, Ar-ma or Ar-me meant 'built by Ar' (the city or country of Ar), or
'the offsp
r
ing (or the son) of Ar', and since Ar was also called Ara. it follows that the name Arme could have been pronounced also as Arame, which is, as wc already know, the name of the founder of the Uranian kingdom, meaning 'the son of the sun', and is preserved by Khorenatsi in the form Aram, as the name of one of the Armenian patriarchs. It must be accepted, therefore, that the name Arma or Arme (AramoAram) was the basic component of the name Arma-ni or Armc-ni, and hence, it represented the name by which Armenians are commonly called by foreigners. This proves that Khorenatsi transmits some ancient and almost accurate information when, writing about
Aram, he states that all the nations of the world call the Armenians
Armcn and their country Armenia after the name of Aram. "... jnpnj (lipuiifiuj) uiGmQ bi uiifbQuijG uiqqf qui fuuiphu ifbp uiQniuiQbQ, npufhu BnjGf UpiTta, bi uipu f bt Uunpfif" Up-fuj ": (1-12.)
(This statement is correct with regard to the name but not the person.) In order to illustrate the meaning of the component ma in the name Ar-ma, signifying 'built, begotten, offspring' or 'the son', we cite below, for comparison, a few examples among many drawn from
ancient insc
r
iptions:
Asfafama - The name of one of the kings of Mitanni.
Dukkama - The name of one of the cities of Armenia.
Tarkuma - This place-name is mentioned by the Hillitc king Mursil. TarAu-ma means "that which is built by
the god TarJfu (Tork', Snpf)". Torkashcn (Snpf
t
totO) in Armenian.



30 ARMENIA. SDBARTU AND SUMbK
Auioma The daughter of Tigran ihe Grcal,who was mar
ried to Milhradaies II of Pontus.
ArtaSama - The name of the daughter of King Artashes of Armenia who was married, according to Khore
nalsi, to "a certain Mithradates, the great prefect
of the Georgians."' ArtaS-a-ma means 'born of ArlaS (or Artashes)'.
There are many more place- and personal names of antiquity in the Near East (including the Armenian Highland) and Asia Minor thai carry lhe suffix -ma, but the examples given above should be sufficient lo show that -ma indeed meant 'built, begotten, offspring, son*. just as the endings -azn, -run. and -Sen in the Armenian language
convey the same meanings in such compound nouns as Ark'ayazn (mpfuijiuqG, 'king's son'), Haykazun (inijl|uiqm.O. 'Hayk's offspring'), and HaykaSen (iuij tO, 'built by Hayk*).
We shall still have opportunity to quote a series of place-names in the Armenian Highland that bear the component At or Ara. Suffice it here lo mention just one direct testimony from a cuneiform inscription showing that lhe region of the land of Arme was actually called
the land of Ar.
The monument of King Mcnua of Urartu, found near Mush, is
covered with insc
r
iptions on all its four sides. In one of them the King
has w
r
itten ihat he had invaded the land of Ucme (= Arme) and that there, in the Ar- j ('Ar-ian' or 'Ara-ian') land, he had left an inscription, Here is the translation of that portion of the inscription lhal interests us: "City ofAtaune, I came forth (to invade) against (he land of Urme, I conquered the land of Urme. I erected this inscription in the Ar-t)i land ..."l0This Ar i {'Arian' or 'Araian') region was in the southeast of Mush and lay in the land of Urme (Arme). This inscription provides a concrete proof that the land of Arme belonged to Ar (or Ara) and that it meant 'born of Ar', or 'built by Ara'.
In ancient cuneiform writings sometimes we find statements where a certain king or a famous personality is considered to be lhe son of his main national god or the son of his nation. Josephus Flavius has preserved a direct and living historical testimony according to which
9 . It seems 10 me thai Khorenatsi. not having concrete and reliable source* before him, has confused ArdaSMtna wiih Auioma and King Mithradates II of Pontus wiih "the great prelect of the Georgians.'

It is evident that it was an Armenian kingdom and her king Adrazar (Zariadr-es) was Armenian. We see that David, instead of specifying this king by his family name Armcn. calls him "the Son of An", revealing thus his national identity. This is another concrete evidence supporting the fact that the name Armani (Armcni) means 'sons of
Ara', or 'the land of the sons of Ara'.
Even after the adoption of Christianity there were still many places in Armenia where sccterians called "sons of the Sun" ("Arevordi", U.pbtnpr)[i) continued to exist, and were strongly opposed by the Catholicos Nerses Shnorhali. The term "Arevordi" persisted in Armenia until the I2lh century of our era.12 Since in the remote past Ar (or Ara) was the main deity of the native peoples of the Armenian highland and since these native peoples were generally called by the name of this god, it would naturally be expected that certain place-names would have been composed with ihe name of this deity or with the name of the people bearing this name. In fact, in antiquity, the entire Armenian Highland was replete with names that contained the component Ar or Ara. It Is true that in later centuries the Armenian Highland, as a high
way between continents, has been subjected to many foreign military, political, and cultural influences and has adopted other deities, resulting in many changes and in compounding of new place-names. even yielding to oblivion the identity of Ara; but still there are many place-names in the country (hat preserve the memory of Ar or Ara.

COMPOSED WITH AR
Wc know that the Syrian chronicler Mar-Aba has copied an important portion of his book from the Greek translation of an ancient Chaldaean source. Movses Khorenaisi, in his turn, drawing from MarAba, transmits to us a very old remembrance-information according to which the central region of Armenia was earlier called Hark' (impf) . Writing about Hayk, the ancestor of the Armenian people, Khorenatsi says that he * 'lived in a high plateau and he called this tableland HarfcV'13 and he adds the following in the next chapter: "But he {Mar-Abas} says, after embalming the body of Bel with ointments, Hayk ordered it to be taken to Hark* and buried in a high place in
view of his wives and sons.11
.
As we see, (he first quotation tells us that Hayk, the god (ancestor) of Armenians, called that particular tableland Hark' by his own name, or thai it was named after him; and the second quotation testifies that the sons of Hayk that is, the Armenians, thc sons of Ar'* (the Armens), were living there. The initial h of the name Hark* seems to be an added intensifying
sound as it is used in (he Armenian language. Compare: RomoHrom

The river thai passes above Lake Van and through ihe entire central region of Armenia is called Ara$ani (pronounced Arsania by the Assyrians)- Academician Ghapantsian« in his book The Cult of Ara ihc Beautiful, shows conclusively that Arasani means 'the river
of Ara',
It is known that the southwestern region of Armenia (ihc region of Nairian lands called Subria) was also called Armc (or Urmc) by ihe Assyrian and Urartian kings, meaning 'the land of the offspring of Ar\ Because of its unique geographical position, this region has maintained its identity by not joining, or not being able to join.

Tiglath-Pileser I calls the region south of Lake Van Haria.17 in the neighborhood of Kuimulu, where he has fought against 25 cities located at the outskirts of its eight mountains. This implies that Haria

The Armenian feudal province (nakhararutyun) in the cast of Lake Van was called Ar runi- This name is derived from Arjumum, mentioned in Urartian inscriptions, which was Ihe name of a city near the

The northcasiern region of Lake Van was4cnown in anliquity by ihe name ArbcranL As it was pointed out earlier in connection with
the meaning of the word her (a va
r
iant of bir, signifying 'race* or 'house*)* Academician Ghapantsian has shown with great accuracy
that Ar-bcr-dni meant the *Ar t
r
ibes'
. Therefore this region also belonged to the Ar people. The region north of Lake Van was called Aramali by Shalmaneser III. As mentioned above* this name was also pronounced (by Sar
gon II) as Armarili (Arma
r
i-li) where the infix
r
i is inserted between the rool-word Arma and the plural-forming suffix -lif as KURSu-ri-/i>
mentioned in the inscription of ArgiSti II near ArCe
f
i, The -// ending in AtH-ma-li is a plural form and corresponds to the -ni ending of the words Ar-ma-ni or Ar-me-ni(cf. BiainMi, Darana-li. Manana4i» etc,)» he/ice the name Ara-ma-li coincides with the name Ar-ma-ni (or Ar-mc-niJ,
It is to be noted that the three components of the name A

the ma component of Ar-ma-m means offsp
r
ing, son\ and that ihe full name Ar-ma-ni (or Ar-me-ni) signifies 'born of Arat sons
of Ar*
, or 'the land of the sons of Ar*.
These considerations clearly show that the names Armani
<= Armeni) and Aramali (= Atberani )l
f
i designate the same people that was in existence in this central region of Armenia even in the times of Shelmaneser III (859-824 B.C.) and Urartu, This must also be accepted as proof that the name Armani was linked with the name Armeni (that il was not Semitic) and that it belonged to the people called Armens ('the sons of Ar*). In (he times of Urartu the region of Shirak was called Eriahi CEri-ian*), Let us mention here, by way of parenthesis, that in ancient Armenian, certain words beginning with ar- had also their parallels beginning with er-. It is accepted in linguistics that replacing ar- by er- is merely a dialectal difference. We already know from the works of Plato that in Pamphylia Ara was called Er (the son of Armenios).
18. The Ar-bct am region has also been called Aya-du (see Adontz. HA. 109). instead of Ara-du, where du is a toponymic suffix. Therefore, the Ar tribe has also been called Ay or Hay (with the initial imensiner
f
t, as in Ark-Hark, ArmaHar/na, Rom-Hrom, etc); hence HarA- could have similarly been pronounced ai Hay*.



ARA'S LAND AND PEOPLE 55
It is also known ihat the personal name Aramaneak or Aramcnak t derived from Ihe ethnic or place-name Armani (Armeni), is rendered E
r
imcna in its Urarlian form. It seems certain, therefore, that the E
r
i
component of the name Eri-a
f
ti was a dialectal variant of the name Am. Hence the conclusion, that the tribal or place-name Erra i ('Eriian), the land-name Ar-hi ('Ar-ian') mentioned by Menua, and the Armin (Armenian) personal name Arafta ('Ara-ian') mentioned by Darius are all homonymous and idcnlical terms, all linked to the name of the god Ar (Ara) or to that of his people, likewise called Ar (Armen or Armin), There must also be a connection between the name Eriafii ('Ara*
ian') and (he name of the river Eras
f
y, pronounced Araks as well. As we sec, the names of the Ara$aui and the Araks rivers are linked with the name Ara of the national god of Armenians and/or with the name Ar (Armen, Vsons of Ar*) of his people. These two rivers that together form a line extending from the west to the east (from the Euphrates to the Caspian Sea), underline and embrace wholly the land called Armenia and they have* for milleniums, constituted the national sacred rivers of the Armenian people lhat have begotten and nourished them. They are to the Armenian people just what the Indus and the Ganges are to the Indians, the Ni7e to the Egyptians, and the Euphrates and the Tigris to the ancient peoples of Mesopotamia. East of Eriahi there is Mount Aragadz. Academician Ghapantsian has also shown correctly that Ara-gadz means 'Ara's throne/11* In the northeast of Lake Urmia there was the Ar u20 ('AMu'
or 'belonging to Ihe Ars') land. The district name ArcW
f
t* ('the Sun people*) mentioned in ancient Armenian literature possibly preserves the memory of this tribe Ar u and its land, All these illustrations show that it was not only Hark'9 the central region of Armenia, ihat was called by the name of Ar (or the Ars), but Lake Van, the heart of Urartu, was entirely surrounded by
the Armani
r
iver, the lands of Arh;, Arme, and Haria, the ArC\tk lake, the habitation of the tribe Arsumuni, and the lands of Arbcrani and Aramali; all linked with the name of Ar (Ara) or that of his

And these are not all. Scattered throughout the entire expanse of Armenia there are numerous place- and tribal names that are derived from Ihe root-word Ar or Ara (and their variants Er or

The Ebla inscriptions revealed that Subarians lived both in Ebla and In (he surrounding regions, evidenced by (he facts that (here were a governor and a master in Ebla bearing the Subarian names Subur and Guzuzi. respectively, and that there were a king called Ar-Ennum, a governor called Irkab-Ar (cf.

gods dAdamma, dHabat, dIShara, and dAStabi (the aASfupi

. SUMERIAN EPIC TALES
In (he light of the information and (he explanations given in preceding pages about the god Ar (Ara) and his country and people in Ihc Armenian Highland, we think it will be easier now to identify ihe cily-$(a(c Aratta» situated somewhere in the Armenian Highland, that constiiulcs the subject of four epic tales (or four variants of one)2 dated (he beginning of (he third millenium B.C. The four variants of this epic tale (probably four sections of one big story), found in a series of cuneiform inscriptions, retain some specific data about Sumer's ancient relations with the Arme* nian Highland. Though these narratives have reached us in the form of epic poetry told by Sumerian troubadours and poets, as it was the style in historiography in that remote past at the beginning of the historical period, (hey contain valuable information that reflect historical facts. These poems shed considerable light on the development of human civilization and on the political, economic, and cultural life of that twilight period of history. Because of the importance they bear upon the topic under study, we wish to present here briefly some episodes from these four epic poems that particularly
interest us.
One of these talcs, which S-N, Kramer has published under the
title Enmcrkar and the Lord of Aratla, was found recorded on
twenty cuneiform tablets and fragments,3 consisting of six hundred lines, where the following story unfolds:
I
, This is ihe Sumcnan dty Uruk. Wc have kepe the form Erech, as mcmioned in the Bible and adopted by Kramer.

deeds. About this, sec £Wa. 22 23



60 ARMENIA. SUBARTU AND SUMER
Once upon a limet Enmerkar,son of-lhe Sun-god, Ulu, having determined to make a vassal stale of Aralta, implores his sister, Inanna, the powerful Sumerian goddess of love and war to see to it that the people of Aratla bring gold, silver, lapis lazuli, and precious stones and build for him various shrines and temples, particularly (he Abzu, the sea temple of Enki, in Eridu. Inanna, heeding Enmerkar plea, advises him lo seek out a suitable herald to cross the imposing mountains of Anshan and assures him that the people of Aratta will submit lo him and carry out the building operations he desires.
Enmerkar selects his herald and sends him to the en of Aratta
with a message containing a threat to destroy and make desolate his city unless he and his peopte bring down silver and gold and build and decorate EnkiTs temple. The herald, after traversing seven mountains, arrives at Aratia, duly repeats his master's words to its en, and asks for his answer. The latter, however, refuses to yield to Enmerkar, claiming that he is Inanna's protege and that she had brought him to Aratta as its ruler. Thereupon, the herald informs him that Enmerkar had brought inanna to Erech and had made her queen of its temple, Eanna, and that the goddess had promised Enmerkar that Aratta would submit to him. The en of Aratta is stunned by (his news- He composes an answer for the herald to lake back to his king in which he admonishes Enmerkar for resorting to arms and says that he prefers a "contest", that is, a fight between two selected champions. He goes on to say that, since Inanna has become his enemy, he is ready to submit lo Enmerkar only if he will send him large quantities of grain. The herald returns to Erech posthaste and delivers the message to Enmerkar in the courtyard of the assembly hall. Before making his next move, Enmerkar performs several acts apparently ritualistic in character. First, he takes counsel with Nidaba, the Sumerian goddess of wisdom. Then he has his beasts of burden loaded with grain. They are led to Aratta by The herald, who is lo deliver to its lord a message eulogizing Enmerkar*s scepter and commanding the lord to bring Enmerkar carnelian and lapis lazuli. On arrival, the herald piles up the grain in the courtyard and delivers his message. The people, delighted with the grain, are ready lo present



ARATTA AND ERECH 61
Enmcrkar wilh the desired carnelian (noihing seems to be said of (he lapis lazuli) and lo have ihe **elders** build his "pure house'* for him. But the hysterical en of Aratta, after eulogizing his own scepter, refuses and insists, in words identical with those of Enmcrkar, that the latter bring fata carnclian and tapis lazuli. On the herald's return to Erech, Enmcrkar seemingly consults the omens, in particular one involving a sus/iimarccd, which he brings forth from *Might to shade" and from "shade lo light"
, until he finally cuts il down "after five ycars after ten years had passed." He sends ihe herald forth once again lo Aratta, this time merely placing the scepter in his hand without any accompanying message. The sight of the scepter seems to arouse terror in the en of Aratta. He turns to his shatam and, after speaking bitterly of the plight of his city as a result of Inanna's displeasure, seems ready to yield to Enmcrkar. Nevertheless, he once again issues a challenge to Enmcrkar. This lime he demands that Enmcrkar select, as his representative, one of his "fighting men" to engage in single combat wilh one of his own "fighting men"
.
Thus 44lhe stronger will become known." On the herald's arrival at Ercch with this new challenge, Enmcrkar bids him return to Aratta with a three-part message: (I) He (Enmcrkar) accepts the cn of Aratta's challenge and is prepared to send one of his own retainers to fight his representative to a decision, (2) He demands that the en of Aratta heap up gold, silver and precious stones for the goddess Inanna in Ercch. (3) He once again threatens Aratta with total destrucion unless its cn and its people bring 4(slones of
the mountain" to build and decorate the Eridu shrine for him ...
A remarkable passage follows which, if correctly interpreted, inform us that Enmcrkar was, in the opinion of the poet, the first to write on clay tablets and that he did so because his herald seemed "heavy of mouth" and unable to repeat the message, perhaps because of its length. The herald
delivers the inscribed tablet to the en of Aratta and awaits
his answer. But help now seems to come to the cn from an unexpected source. The Sumerian god of rain and storm, lshkur« brings to Aratta wild wheal and beans and heaps them up before the cn. At the sight of the wheat the cn takes courage. His confidence regained, he informs Enmcrkar's



62 ARMENIA, SUBARTU AND SUMER
herald thai Inanna had by no means abandoned Araua or
her house and bed there.
From here on, the text becomes fragmentary and ihc context difficult to follow, except for the statement that the people of Aratta did bring gold, silver, and lapis lazuli to Ercch and heaped ihem up in the courtyard of Eanna for Inanna.4
In another Sumerian epic poem, which consists of close (o three hundred lines ... we again find Enmerkar, the en
of Erech in a bitter contest with an en of Aratta, but with
one in this case who bears the good Sumerian name Ensukushsiranna. Its plot, very briefly put, is as follows: In ihe days when a certain Ennamibaragga-Utu was king of an empire presumably including Sumer and parts of ancient Iran, Ensukushsiranna, the en of Aratta, issued a challenge 10 Enmerkar, the en of Erech, demanding that the latter recognize him as his overlord and that the goddess Inanna be brought to Aratta. Enmerkar is contemptuous of the challenge and in a long address, in which he depicts himself as (he favorite of (he gods, declares that Inanna will remain in
Erech and demands that Ensukushsiranna become his vassal.
Ensukushsiranna gathers the members of his council and asks them for advice. They counsel him lo submit to Enmerkar, but this he indignantly refuses to do. Whereupon the mashmash * priest of Aratta comes to his aid and boasts that he will subdue Erech - and indeed, all the lands (iabove and below, from the sea to the cedar mountain" - by his magical power. Ensukushsiranna is delighted and gives him five minas of gold and five minas of silver as well as the necessary supplies. The
mashmash arrives in Erech in due course but is out
witted by the goddess Nidaba's two shepherds and a wise old crone by the name of Sagburru, who finally kills him and (hrows his dead body into the Euphrates. When Ensukushsiranna hears of what has befallen his mashmash, he hurriedly sends a mes
senger to Enmerkar and capitulates completely, admitting abjectly thai Enmerkar is his superior.5

ARATTA AND ERECH 63
Another Sumenan epic lale whose conienis are revealing of the extraordinary close political, religious, and cultural contacts between Erech and Aralla is one which may be entitled "Lugalbanda and Enmerkar/* it consists of approximately four hundred lines, and the relevant details of its plot are as follows: Lugalbanda, one of the heroes of Erech belonging to Enmerkar's military entourage, has just returned to Erech from a perilous journey only to find his lord and liege in great distress. For many years past, the Semitic Martu have been ravaging both Sumer and Uri (roughly the later Akkad). Now they are laying siege to Erech itself, and Enmerkar finds that he must get a call for help through to his sister (none other than the goddess Inanna of Aratta). But he can find no one to undertake the dangerous journey to Aratta to deliver the message. Whereupon, Lugalbanda steps up to his king and bravely volunteers for the task. Upon Enmerkar's insistance on secrecy, he swears that he will make the journey alone ... He lakes up his weapons, crosses the seven mountains that reach from one end of Anshan to the other** ... and finally arrives with joyful step at his destination. In Aratta, Lugalbanda is given a warm welcome by Inanna. She asks what has brought him all alone from Erech lo Aratta, and he repeats verbatim Enmerkar message and
call for help. Inanna's answer is obscure; it seems lo involve a river and the river's unusual fish which Enmerkar is to catch; also involved are certain water vessels which he is to fashion.
Enmerkar does as directed, and the poem closes with a paean of praise to Aratta, which seems to have supplied Enmerkar
with metal- and sloneworkersS
Regarding Aratta's location, Kramer, making some critical judgments, has the following to say:
... our poems depict it (Aratla) as separated from Erech, in southern Mesopotamia, by the entire land of Anshant from
its "shoulder" to its "head," and Anshan. most scholars
6
. Ibid. 273. If the Anshan highland represents the Zagros range which extends from Elam to Ararat (along the western shore of Lake UrmiaK then "from one end of Anshan to the other'* means from the approaches of Sumer (Elam) to the land of Ararat.

64 ARMENIA, SUBARTU AND SUMER
agree, is siluaied in southwestern Iran. A problem arises, however, in trying to locate Aralta in relation to Anshan. Is it to be sought north of Anshan in the direction of Lake Urmia and the Caspian Sea, or to the east in the direction of Baluchistan and India, or to the south in the direction of Laristan
and the Persian Gulf? Once again, it is a Sumerian epic tale which may give us the answer. This poem, which may be entitled Luga/banda and Mourn Hurum,... tells the following
story.
Enmerkar. the lord of Ercch. has decided to journey to Aralta in order to make it a vassal state. Accompanied by a
vast host of Erechites under the command of seven unnamed
heroes and Lugalbanda. who. to quote the words of the poem,
"was their eighth," he arrives at Mount Hurum. Then and
there Lugalbanda falls ill. His brothers and friends do all they can to revive him, but to no avail. Taking him for dead, they decided that they will leave his corpse on Mount Hurum. proceed on their journey to Aratla, and on their return from the campaign, pick up his body and carry it back to Erech. But Lugalbanda is not dead. Abandoned and forsaken. he prays to the gods of the sun, moon, and the Venus star, and they restore his health. He wanders all over the highland steppe, and there we must leave him for the present, since our available texts break off at this point.
Then Kramer draws the following conclusion regarding the
location of Aratta:
It is clear from the poem that Mount Hurum was situated
somewhere between Erech and Aratta. and since it is not
unreasonable to assume that Mount Hurum was the original home of the Human prople from the neighborhood of Lake Van, we may conclude that Aratta lay in the viciniiy of Lake Urmia or perhaps even farther east. In fact, Enmerkar's campaign to Aratta might be compared to some extent with that of Sargon II more than two thousand years later (714 B.C.) to the land of the Manna/, the account of which, interestingly
enough, mentions the crossing of a river called Aratta, a name reminiscent, perhaps, of the city Aratta.H

. ABOUT THE LOCATION OF ARATTA
Before making our remarks on the location of Aralta and the
relations it had with Sumer, we deem ii necessary to summame some of the salient features of the four variants of the Sumerian
epic tale which is in general, based on the interrelationships of the lords of the two city-siatest Aratta and Erech*
I
. Inanna, the goddess of love and war, first belonged to Aratta where she had her temple, but later Enmcrkar took her to Erech and built there the temple Eanna for her.

. Inanna is considered to be the sister of Enmerkar who is
assumed to be the son of the sun-god Utu. 3
. In one variant of the epic talc, Enmcrkar demands the sub
mission of the lord of Arattat in another he asks Aralla*s help to save Erech from the siege laid by the enemy Martu; at other times it is the lord of Aratta that demands Enmerkar to submit to him.
(Hence the supposition that these poems represent separate episodes or various sections of one big and general epic talc.)

ties between Aratta and Erech.

. On the road from Sumerian Erech to Aratta there is Mount

Huruml which Kramer assumes to be the home of the Hurrian people in the neighborhood of Lake Van, For the location of Aratta we find the following indications in Ihe epic tale: a) As it was jusl said, between Erech and Aralla, in the vicinity of Lake Vanf there was Mount Hurum of the Hurrian people- Writes Kramer: "The Hurrians, as it is well known, lived originally on Mount Hurum* the region about Lake Van/'9 According to this indication, this mountain corresponds to the Haria highland below Lake Van where is the Urualri range (the Ararad range, as mentioned by Khorenatsi)* Therefore Aratta was situated above Haria-Uruatri.
Since Mount Hurum was between Erech and Aratta, Aratta could
not have been situated in the east of Lake Urmia, in the region of the Caspian Sea, because in that case, first, Mount Hurum would not have fallen between Erech and Aratta, and, secondly, Aralta's
metal and stone mines would have been far and out of Ihe water
ways leading to Sumer, Aratta's mashmash presumptuously stales that he will subdue all the lands above and below, from the sea (the Persian Gulf) to Ihe cedar (Amanus) mountain. It follows, then, that Aratta was situated directly above these regions, and not so far as the south of the Caspian Sea, b) In ihe epic tale mention is made of a river and vessels to transport the construction materials from Aratta to Erech. In Mesopotamia the only navigable rivers leading to Sumer are the Tigris and the Euphrates; therefore, the reference must be to one of these rivers. This is a second proof that Aratta was situated in the highland where the headwaters of the Tigris and the Euphrates were. The
details in the tale suggest (hat for the identification of this river we should consider particularly the Tigris and its important tributary, the Greater Zab, since both pass through the region or the vicinity of the Haria-Hurum highland. c) A third proof that Aratta was situated around the upper streams of these Mesopotamian rivers is provided by the fact that the grain was transported to Aratta by pack animals and not by boats; obviously it would have been extremely difficult to navigate
upstream.
d) Having in view the Greater Zab-Tigris waterway, we think that Ihe mentioning of the unusual fish in the river is very signi

ficanl. This is noi a figmcnl of imagination in a legend but represents a reality. In fact, there is. in these regions, a certain species of fish that is unusually large for a river. Before (he Second World War I have had the personal experience of seeing some of these giant fish, about two metres long* (hat were brought to Mosul, cut into pieces and sold. It was incredible, indeed, thai such a huge fish could live and grow in a river. There is an interesting tradition in that part of the country today which, I think, must be somewhat related to the existence of this fish of uncommon size- Near Mosul, on the small hill of the ruins
of Nineveh, there is a village called Nebi-Yunes- In the mosque of
this village (built on the site of one of the oldest Ch
r
istian monasteries that stands on the ruins of a pagan temple), in a deep and dark room, there is, hanging from a wall, a big bone, which, the natives traditionally believe, belonged to the
f
ish that "swallowed
the prophet Jonas." Hence the name of the village, Ncbi-Yunts,
"the prophei Jonas/* (In fact, Jonas has been identi
f
ied with the
Babylonian fishgod Oannes.) It seems probable thai the Bible story
is mingled with a local tradition inhe
r
ited from the remote past (probably from the Assyro-Babylonians) related to a kind of big and
unusual fish thai lived in the
r
iver nearby. Sargon II in his invasion to Mana encountered a river called
Anna. This
r
iver could have been far from the city-state of Aratta and still carry that name merely by repetition, just as it Is the case with the two Haburs (one a branch of the Euphrates and the other
of the Tig
r
is), and the two Ararats (one in the south in Kortuk\ on the eastern Tigris, and the other in the north on the Arax river), According to Sargon's statement, the Aratta river appears to be
the northernmost branch of the Lesser Zab, whose source is near
Kelishin (south of Musasir) in the southern part of the Vaspurakan range and, perhaps, is reminiscent of the old name of this highland. From this region originates also the Araskh (< Aratta (?)) river
which flows into the southern shores of Lake Urmia. In the Louvre
listing, the
r
iver Aratta is mentioned along with a number of mountains, among which is Mount Sinabir]0 that corresponds to the
country of Sinibir-ni, one of the known 23 count
r
ies of Nam
All these considerations allow us to assume that what is said
about the

ish) in the Aralta-Erech epic talc,

relaie lo the Greater Zab and the Tigris. A look at the map of the region shows that the Greater Zab, emerging in the north from the Vaspurakan mountains, cuts across the Haria-Uruatri (Hurum) range in (he Hakkiari region and flowing down joins (he Tigris just south of Mosul. (In this connection one must, of course, have also in view the Euphrates which, by means of its tributary, the Aradzani, links Sumer with the land of Ayrarat). It must be accepted, therefore, that the land of the city-state of Aratta was situated in the regions extending from Hayots Tsor and Afberani, near Lake Van, lo the north, spreading from the ArmeArhi-Aradzani-Hark' regions lo those of Aragadz-Aria-Arevik-Arhu. (For these names see Map 2.) In one word, it covered the land of Ayrarar, having as center the Eritia (<Araia?) mountain near Aramali. mentioned by Shalmaneser III, and Mount Ararat. It is assumed that the name Ararat (or AyraraO is derived from the name Urartu. If this is the case, then why is it that the name Araral is given to this parlicular mountain and not to any one of those mountains that are situated much more centrally in Urartu near its
capital Van or near Lake Van, such as the Nemrut, the Sipan, or the Varag? Besides, there already was Mount Ararad (the Uruatri in [he south of Lake Van), as mentioned by Khorcnatsi. It is not unlikely, therefore, that (his mountain may have been called earlier by a name derived from Ara, such as Araffa. Deimel considers it probable that the word ara«a had, in fact, the composition ar-ar-ta. Ararta had become Aralta (apparently by the second r being pronounced as t influenced by the adjacent 0 just as the Sumerian reduplicated word barbar had changed to babbar, 'sun' (by the change in pronunciation of the first r to b under the influence of the adjacent 6). In this case, Ararta would mean 'the land of Ars1. In fact, the name Ararat could have originated more easily from the form Ararta (ta>al) rather than from Urartu, just as the place-name Ararad, mentioned by Khorenatsi, could be derived more easily from the form Urardi, mentioned by Sargon II, or from the name of the Arardiu mountain of the same region, as mentioned by ASSurnasirpal II. rather than from the
name Uruatri.
It is obvious that (he radical element Ar (or Ara) is a component of Aralta (or Ararfa). It seems its composiiion is cither Ara(t)la or
11. ARAB, 143.



AHATTA AND ERECH 69
Ar-ar-ia, a rrduplicaled form, which can be compared with Horhorum, s jMiku( Haha, and other reduplicated names. It must have meant 4Arfs place1 (Ara-ta) or *ihc city-land of the Ars* (Ar-ar-ta). Compare it with the land-name Baruafa, mentioned in Urartian inscriptions, which was called Bif-Ba/rua,12 'house of Bamia\ in Assyrian. Hence the toponymic ending -fa of the form Barua-ta corresponds to the component bj( (*houset city-land*, cf- Arabic C f bcit, .house1) of Bii-Barma. It seems, then, that Araffa (Ararta) meant ,Ara*s house' to which corresponded semantically the names Ayrarat1* (4Ara's plain1) and Urartu/Ur-ardi14 ('place of Ardi-Ara'). From what has been reported by Khorenatsi, we already know thai Ayrarar meant 'Ara's plain*. He writes: "5/iam/ram came in
basic to the plain of Ara that was called Ayrarar a
f
ter his name*" We also know that the Urartian divine name Ardi (4sun*) corresponds to Ara. (This will be shown later in the section on Nuard.) In our previous works we have shown (and shall still show later) that the name Urarlu, or Urardi (Ur-ardi) as written by Sargon II, meant 'the place of Ardi1
, thai is, *the land of Ara*. This already corresponds to the name Ayrarar ('Ara's plain*). It is possible, therefore, that ihc name Urartu (Urardi, Uratri, or Uru-atri) is perhaps a later cuneiform expression of the name Ayrarat (Ararat) or Aralta (Ararta). Thus it becomes apparent that the name Aratta (or Arana) belongs to the group of place-names in the Armenian highland which are
formed with Ar or A ra
il follows, then, that Araffa turns out to be the oldest city-state of the Armenian Highland known so far, dating from the beginning of the third and possibly from the end of the fourth millenium B.C., the memory of which persists, most probably, in the name Ayrarat
(< Ararat),
As mentioned earlier, even though all the information regarding

the ancient ties and relations between Aratta and Erech (hence Sumcr) have reached us in the form of epic poems of some 1500 lines pre* served on a series of cuneiform tablets, still they conslitule a valuable
source where we find the reflections of real historical events and
socio-economic conditions. One must remember that the epic talc was the main and only style of historiography in that remote past,
at the very beginning of written history. We find, therefore, thai what is transmitted to us through the four variants of this epic tale has inestimable value for the history of the most ancient period of the Armenian Highland, the land wherein lie the sources of the Tigris and the Euphrates. These talcs arc like beams of light thai pierce the obscurity of the past and shed a momentary glow on the political, social, religious, economic and cultural conditions of the peoples of the Armenian Highland in that very early period (the beginning of the third millen* ium B.C.), which is still dark for modern historiography. They elucidate, in particular, their ties and interrelations with Sumcr, about which we shall speak again in our next chapter. There is a number of similarities in government structure that can be observed between Aratta and Erech. Both city-states had an "en*' (priest-king) at the head and a council of "elders*' (or communities). Each state had the same type of divisions of administrative and political affairs, and functions and functionaries were designated by the same terms (cnsit sukkal. shatam, ragaba, ugula}.]The religious tic between Aratta and Erech (hence Sumcr) is striking in the epic tale. Inanna, the goddess of love and war, who is considered Sumerian (and whom the Semites identify sometimes
with Ishtar), belonged earlier, according to the tales, to Aratta, and it was none other than Enmcrkar himself who brought her to
Erech.16 As wc have seen, it was Enmerkar who asked Inanna of
Aratta to intervene in favor of securing Aratta's help to save Erech from the siege of the enemy Manu, and Inanna had a warm welcome for Enmerkar's herald Lugalbanda in Aratta. In the epic tale the goddess Inanna is figured as the supreme power, since Enmerkar's envoy asks her for help. She had the highest authority in her hand and her will was decisive, indicating that in those days the idea of matriarchy had not yet vanished entirely in Aratta, and that particular social order was still main

ARATTA AND ERECH 71
taincd to a certain extent under the supremacy of the goddess Inanna. She is represented as the mother and the patron of her people and her land. This particular characteristic of Inanna's nature has persisted for milleniums. and in the last centuries of paganism has been represented by ihe goddess Anahii as the patron mother of Armenia. Moris Jastow writes that Assyria had only one goddess, Ishlar. who had the same rank in the Semitic pantheon as the goddesses Nana, Nina, Ninni. Inanna, and Anumr had in Sumer.'7 This shows
that the forms Anunit (Anahit) and Inanna represenied variants of the same name of the same goddess.
<
Fig. 3. Anahii
It is clearly seen, then, thai in Armenia, in the later periods of paganism, Inanna appears as Anahit (sometimes as /Vane). Nu, as the abbreviated form of these names (in derivation), is the first component of the name of the Armenian goddess Nuart (Nuard), who was the consort of the sun-god Ara. In the times of Urartu, the name Ara appears sometimes in the derivative form Ar-di (Ardi), which, as is obvious, is the second component of Nu-ard. The word nu is preserved in Armenian with the meaning
of 'bride'
. Hence Nu-ard means 'the nu of ard', that is, 'Ara's
bride or wife'. This agrees with Khorenatsi's testimony that Nuard was Ara's wife.1" In Sumer, Inanna's consort (and Ishtar's in Babylonia) was

72 ARMENIA, SUBARTU AND SUMER
Dumuzi (Tammuz), who, by virtue of his nature, is identified with Ara by Armenologists.19 Hence, Nuard is none other than Inanna. Wc can accept, therefore, that in spile of the many upheavals and tribulations throughout the milleniums, the goddess Inanna, being preserved under the names Nuard and Anahitt has continued 10 remain the patron mother and the native goddess of fertility and war of the Armenian Highland, that is» of Aralla or Araria), *Ara*s
land*; a fact, about which, as we have seen, there are direct and
concrete references in the Sumcrian epic talc, Enmerkar, the king of Erech, was believed to be 4*the son of the sun-god Ulu." Hence, considering Inanna his sister, he has demanded from Aratta lo supply stoneworkcrs for the construction of the temples in Erech and Eridu. This reminds us of a similar case in much later times: towards the end of the 10 century A,D, the Byzantine emperor Basil who was of Armenian origin, invited the
renowned architect Trdat from Armenia, the land of his ancestors
(under Bagratuni rule at the lime), to rebuild the dome (of more than 30 metres in diameter) of the Si- Sophia Church in Constantinople, demolished in an earthquake, because there were no capable masters there at ihe time.30
For the construction and embellishment of the temples in Erech and Eridu, Enmerkar has asked Aratta to supply not only metaland stoneworkers and sculptors, but also precious metals ("gold, silver'1), precious siones ("carnelian, lapis lazuli") and building stones ("stones of the mountain11) in return for grain. What can
be concluded from this is that the people living in the Armenian Highland at the beginning of the third millenium B.C- must have had an economy rich in the production of precious metals and stones and building materials, that, compared to their neighbors, they must have reached a considerably high level of development in metallurgical and quarrying industries, and that they must have already had, in these early times, skilled metalworkers, sculptors, masons and architects, capable to build and decorate temples and shrines, whose fame had spread to faraway lands, even to Sumer, which, developed as she was, still lacked the materials and the skills.

. ARATTA AND AYRARAT
In connection with Araua*s location, wc wish to call here special attention to the discovery of Medzamor in the Ayrarat valley in Armenia, which was an ancient famous center of spiritual and material (mainly in metallurgy) culture that lasted from the fourth
millenium B.C. to late medieval times. Here is what ihe noted
archaeologist E. Khanzadian says in his article on Medzamor. quoted from The Soviet Armenian Encyclopedia:
MEDZAMOR. A very ancient fortress-settlement in the Ararat valley, near the sources of the Medzamor river. ... Its real name is unknown, hence at present it is called [provisionally] Medzamor after the name of the river. ... This
most ancient settlement is situated on one of the volcanic
cones of the middle anthropogenetic period and the surrounding plain, comprising an area of 30 hectares. It is surrounded with water on almost every side: on the northwest it is bounded by the Medzamor river and on the east it is protected by artificial moats. Archaeological excavations have proven that Medzamor has been continuously inhabited from the middle of the fourth millenium B.C. to the late Middle Ages. The layers of various cultures that have been dug so far relate to the early, middle, and late phases of the Bronze Age, the early and the developed phases of the Iron Age (pre-Urartian. Urartian and antique), and the Middle Ages. Medzamor is one of the centers of early Bronze Age culture (third millenium B.C.) of the Ararat valley. The fort on the big hill was protected by a turreted Cyclopean wall, and
outside the wall, on vast elevations, were built the residences
and the utility buildings. Artifacts discovered on the site prove that at Medzamor agriculture, animal husbandry and
the crafts were at a developed stage. The lesser hills had astronomical as well as ritualistic significance, and. as studies have substantiated, in 2800-2600 B.C. the site was used to
observe the rising of Sirius (whose appearance was probably related to the beginning of the new year and was wors/i/pcd). Studies made on Medzamor's ziggurat-obscrvatory that served for ritual ceremonies held in the open air, and on the monumental tower at Mokhrablur suggest the possibility



74 ARMENIA, SUBARTU AND SUMER
of the formation of rural communities and the csiablishmenl
of cities around these temples, in other words, rhe existence of an "urban revolution" in the Armenian Highland in the third millenium B.C., which had the consequence of shaking the foundations of the primeval social order, The fort, protected by strong Cyclopean walls, contained basically the dwellings of the rulers and the priesthood, the temple complex and the main production units (foundaries, workshops, metal-enrichment plants). The pre-Urartian city consisted of the living quarters of the middle and lower classes. The city had a separate shrine, a section of which is preserved in the place called Karmir-K'arer ('Red Stones*), The finds reveal that the occupations of the inhabitants consisted of crafts, trade* husbandry, viniculture and vegetable growing. There existed a large-scale smelting industry, evidenced by the cylindrical brick smelters and heaps of spent mineral and casting molds found near them. In Medzamor an extensively developed animal husbandry had contributed to widening the gap between classes of property owners. This is testified by the huge stone burial chambers excavated in a field of about 50 hectares of surface area and extending approximately half a kilometre to the east and the northwest of the citadel. These burial chambers that belonged to leaders and other representatives of the court were enframed with tablets decorated with high relief sculptures of horses and
lions. In the center of the burial chamber was the tomb of
the leader, buried on a wooden bier, together with various objects of gold, silver, bronze and tin, shaped beads of carnelian, agate amber and glass, colorfully varnished pottery, ceramic ware ornamented with hunting scenes, and stone goblets, all of which are eloquent witnesses for the high level of development of the crafts, saturated with technological innovations, particularly in jewellery and metallurgy. Along with the leader were buried also servants, slaves, horses, big and small horned animals (and probably hunting dogs), But the most remarkable find among all the others is a sculpture of a frog, made of onyx, which is a Babylonian weighing*stone, and bears cureiform inscriptions. It is dated 16 century B,C,21

In view of all these material and tangible evidences supplied by Medzamor, testifying to its great and ancient past reaching the middle of the fourth millenium B.C., we are tempted to assume rhat it is not unlikely that this city might be the famous city of Aratta, the subject of the Sumerian epic tales (or an important cHy in the land of Aratta). There are more than one indications of various nature that suggest this assumption, the following being the most
obvious: I
. The story told in the Sumerian epic poems has taken place in the
f
irst quarter of the third millenium B.C. Medzamor was in full activity at that time.
2
. Medzamor is situated in the Ararat valley which was part of



76 ARMENIA, SUBARTU AND 5UMER
the land of Ayrarat- As we have seen, Ayraral corresponded to Araiia by ils geographical location (and probably also by name),
3
. Medzamor, with its foundaries, workshops, metal-enrichment plants and heaps of spent mineral, was an important metallurgical center. The excavated objects of gold, silver, bronze, and fin, as well as the beads made of carnelian* agate, amber, and glass show a high level of culture in goldsmitbery and jewellery. All these seem to have fully justified Enmerkar lo demand of Aratta (even by sending wheat in return) to supply him with gold, silver, precious
stones, and also metalworkers for the construction and the embellish
ment of the temples in Erech and Eridu.22
There were built in Medzamor not only Cyclopean walls and lowers, but also temples and dwelling structures- In fact, the land of Ararat is very rich in basalt, marble and various other building stones; it is actually the richest region in the world in light and beautiful tuff. This, too, was ample justification for Enmerkar to ask Aratta to supply 14stoncs of the mountain/* sculptors and stone* workers for the construction of temples
4
, As we have seen above, archaeology has revealed that in Medzamor, between 2800-2600 B.C., people have observed the rising of Sirius and have worshiped it. One cannot bypass such an important evidence and we would like lo draw particular aitention to it. First, it must be noted that Enmerkar lived exactly in these days, Being Gilgamesh's (cir, 2680 B.C.) grandfather, he must have lived around 2750 B,C, Second, from the information given in the epic tales, we know that the goddess Inanna belonged to Aratta, It is possible, therefore, that at that time Inanna was none other than Sirius,23 and
that the rising of this star was considered by the people of Aratta as a sign that she belonged to them and protected them. This is why
22, In connection with Araua, it is imeresnng to note here the province ofAnsakh in Armenia (in the east or the Ararat valley) and ils name. This area, rich in gold (at Zod), silver, copper, and other mines, was called Ardakh9 Urdekhe, in the times of Urartu. We must consider also Mount Eritia, north of Lake Van,
mentioned by Shalmancser III or the city of Eridia, mentioned by ISpuini. It reminds us of the name of the dty of Eridu in Sumer, for the construction of which an important part is attributed to the people of Aratta. In fact, the dty of HA,A*1 (=Eridu) of the first Sumerian antediluvian dynasty is mentioned as Subari in Akkadian translation. It could have been possible, therefore, thai this dty was built by Subarians who descended from the north (the Armenian Highland) and was named after them, (On this see HSP 31,) 23, Semites have identified Inanna with Ishtar who personified Venus,



ARATTA AND ERHCH 77
the king of Aralla has sent a message to EnnVerkar (through his herald) staling thai Inanna had not abandoned neither Araita nor her house therein (the zigguraMemple that was also an observatory).
(We have stated earlier that Inanna was the same as Anahit who
was the patron mother of Armenia, According to Melik-Pashayan. in the long past, the Ayghr lake and the Sev-Jur river, on which the ancient site of Mcdzamor is situated, were called Mcdzamor ('the great mother') after Anahii'% name*24 This is interesting, if true.25)
5
, The fact thai in the huge stone bu
r
ial chamber at Medzamor. along with the leader were also found buried servants9slavesr horses, big and small horned animals and precious objects, can he considered an evidence for the religious lies and the similarity of beliefs and
customs thai existed between Sumer and Medzamor (and Ayrarat in general). This remind* us of the burial chamber at Ur of Sumer, discovered by the Anglo-American archaeological expedition under the direction of C.L. Woolley, where, in front of the door of the chamber where the deceased was laid, were buried also men, women,
and animals with their equipment* This custom certainly could have existed among many other peoples in the past, but its roots in Armenia were so deep and ancient that it has perpetuated for milieniums, even up to the time of the Artashessian Dynasty. Khorenatsi
has recorded that King Artashes of Armenia was bu
r
ied with great pomp and ceremony "in a golden sarcophagus, with numerous ornaments and weapons ... and many of his favorite women, concubines and servants died, or, as Khorenatsi interprets, were killed and buried with him according to pagan customs, "t7

lions and tells a lot about the metals and thcprecious stones to be weighed for Babylon, thus, testifying to an active trade with her. The trade relations ihat Armenia had with Babylon have continued for thousands of years even after the time of this weighing
stone. They have constituted a firm and natural tradition between the two countries conditioned by the two waterways, the Tigris and the Euphrates. Herodotus has supplied substantial information about the business thai went on between the Armenians and the Babylonians over the Euphrates.2" How can one explain these exceptionally close ties between Aratla and Erech, at thai early period of Sumer's life in Southern Mesopotamia, ties that have been considered so important as to become the subject matter of epic poems? S. Kramer writes about Aratta: "A far-off city-stale ... which owes iis fame and name not to its own achievements, though these seem to have been quite a few. but to the bards and poets of Sumer who. for some as yet undiscovered reason, sang of its metals and stones, its craftsmen and artisans, its boldly challenging en and its beloved goddess, who seems
to be none other than Inanna of Sumer."**
As it was mentioned earlier, in evaluating the credibility of the events related in Ihe epic poems, one must not forget that the epic poem was Ihe only hisloriographic style employed at the time, and although the legendary unfolding of the events presented there cannot be accepted literally, nevertheless, they contain certain elements
based on real historical facts which must be evaluated as such. For
example, we. certainly, do not accept lhat every single word exchanged between the two kings was literally true, nor that the herald had really made so many trips and so fast between Erech and Arana. quite far from each other. lo carry a response for every statement; but we do not overlook the essential significance of the mission either. In essence, the information contained in the epic talcs attributes lo Aratta an important participation in the construciion and adornment of the temples in Erech and Eridu. the most ancient cities of Sumer. In other words, ihe people of Aratla have played a prominent pari, with their contribution of precious metals, stones and craftsmen, in the work of building and embellishing these cities. Ihe iniiia

Such an assumption of course entails close contacts and religious* cultural and even marital ties wi(h the people of (he Armenian Highland. There are some indications that the Sumerians have previously been a mountain people and (hat they believed that their gods dwelled on mountain tops; this is (he reason why in Sumer they built high ziggurats and placed (heir god's throne
on their summits,
Enmerkcr, who was regarded as "the son of the sun-god", considered Inanna, the goddess of Aratta, as his sister, and he was the one who brought Inanna, formerly belonging to Aratta* to Ercch and built a temple for her. In our previous works we have spoken at length about the Sumcro-Armcnian connections and have brought out more than one hundred Sumchan words (hat have their parallels in Armenian, close to half of them being Indo-European* On the other hand* the
number of Sumcrian words known (o us that concur with Armenian
is more than two hundred.
2
. The close lies between Aratta and Sumer could have deve
loped by means of naturaMradinonal imerrelationships coming from a more distant past, made possible between the two sides through the Euphra[cs and the Tigris waterways. As we have seen, the epic talc speaks about building vessels to transport cons(ruc(ion material and craftsmen from Aratta to Erech, whereas the grain is moved up* from Erech to Aratta, on pack animals. As long as the Tigris and the Euphrates have existed, (he ties between the peoples living at their two extremhies mus( be taken as a natural phenomenon of millenial antiquity. One of (he proofs of these contacts is the concrete testimony given by Herodotus (5,h century
B
.C.) who, writing more than two thousand years after the times of Enmerkar, states iha( (he Armenians had very close commercial ties with Babylon over the Euphrates, and describes in detail how they would load (heir merchandise and donkeys to shield-shaped rafts made
of wood cut from (he forcs(s in Armenia and covered wi(h hides, how



10 ARMENIA. SUBARTL AND SUMFJt
they would sail down the river lo Babylon, and after selling the goods and the wood of (he rafis, ihcy would load ihc hides on the donkeys and return home, only to sian ihe irip over again. According to Xenophon, the Armenians had connections even with India. He informs us thai King Cyrus of Persia had asked the Armenians to accompany the Persian ambassador to India and present him to India's king.w These examples are important indications showing the ancient traditional relations that the Armenians hadt through the Euphrates and the Tigris, with Southern Mesopotamia and even beyond, with India. Otherwise, why wouldn't Cyrus ask such a service of some other people living in the south of Persia and closer to India, such as the Elamites or the Babylonians? Obviously for Ihe reason that Armenians already had a fame in matters of this nature.
3
. It is also possible that the Sumerians could have acquired their knowledge of and developed connections with Araua merely by means of ihc intrusions they made to that country, led by a curiosity for the mysterious highland where lay the sources of the Euphrates and the
Tigris, or du
r
ing their marauding or conquering raids to that
r
ich high
land- The Sumerians had traditional legends about these sacred
r
ivers that were vital for them- The disiani land where they sprang forth and where the gods who made ihcm flow had set their thrones, was shrouded for them with legendary mysticism. The Sumerians believed that gods dwelled on mountain tops, that is why they used to build high ziggurats, symbolizing mountains, as the dwelling-place of their divinities. It is natural, therefore, that a strong desire would be aroused in them to reach that mysterious highland, to know and even
to conquer it.
Barely four centuries after Enmerkar, Lugal-Zaggisi (2371-2347
B
.C), the king of Umma, after subduing a few Sumerian cities, has launched an invasion towards the Armenian Highland, about which he has written the following: "... when the god Enlil had delivered the kingdom of the land to Lugal-Zaggisi. -, and when his might had subdued the lands and when he had conquered them from the sunrise to the sunset, then he opened a straight way from the Lower Sea to the Upper Sea, through the Euphrates and the Tigris It is obvious thai ihe Upper Sea that he reached through the Euphrates

a question of religious obligation and royal honor and authority to reach the upper land above the Euphrates and the Tigris, to sec it and occupy it. He writes In one of his inscriptions: "In my fifteenth year of reign I advanced to the sources of the Tigris (and) Euphrates. I
set up (i.e. carved) my royal image on their cliffs."32 It should nol be considered unlikely, therefore, that in the limes of Enmcrkar (perhaps even before) the Sumerians might have reached
Aiana and established connections with her.
4
. It is also possible thai the Sumerians could have inherited the traditions about Aratta's wealth, culture and fame from those groups of natives of the Armenian Highland who. moving along the streams of ihe Euphrates and the Tigris, penetrated or immigrated to Southern Mesopotamia in much earlier times (before and after the arrival of (he Sumerians). settled there and later mixed with the Sumerians. Wc also consider it probable lhai those who have carried infor
mation about Aratta 10 Sumer could have been the Subarians. who, according to preserved cuneiform writings, had already penetrated inio Southern Mesopotamia in the distant past and had. in a great cxieni. mixed with the Sumerians and later with the Semites. (This topic will be dealt wiih later.) We have already seen that Armani was in ihe land of Subari, or. more precisely, the central regions of the main land called Subartu corresponded to the souihern regions of the Armenian Highland.

. THE SUBARIANS
Who were the Subarians? I
, Gelb asks the same question, ihen he adds: t4A correci answer to this question has not yet been given.11 He considers the Subarians a people who» with ihcir ethnicity and language* are distinct from the Humans, and in order to prove his viewpoint he has written the book Humans and Subarians, where he brings numerous evidences and arguments showing that Subarians were not Hurrians, Nevertheless, many others still seem to retain the initially held opinion that under the name Subarian one must see the llurrians. One thing is certain, that the Subarians, according to written docu* ments of the historical period, were the aborigines of the Armenian Highland, especially of its southern (and neighboring) regions: those regions, which, as cuneiform inscriptions at hand testify, were mentioned for the first time by the name Armani (or Armanum), to be followed later by the names Arime, Arme and Armina. Subartu consisted, previously, of the southern sections of a large linguistico-cultural community (including the entire Armenian Highland, the Indo-European homeland) which were in immediate
contact with Sumero-Akkadians.
The large country of Subartu was not always a united statc, In the past it was very often divided into a number of autonomous units. This is why the name Subartu has eventually acquired a ralber geographical meaning. Tukulti-Ninurta 1 (1243*1221 B.C.) gives the names of a series of such autonomous state-units ihat were part of Subartu in (he second half of the second millenium B.C.
He writes: At that lime the Babhi, the lands of Kutmuhi,

These countries that enicrcd into (he realm of Subartu spread over [he vast area stretching from Lake Urmia to Cappadocia, A
number of evidences show thai the Subarians1 homeland extended
even to the depths of the Armenian Highland comprising all the
Nairian countries. Ashur-Nasir-Pal 1 writes: "The mountain of Kashiari I crossed and for the second time I went down into the land of Nairi It is obvious that the land he entered after descending Mount Kashiari was Armc-Subria> which he calls the land of Nairi. On the other hand, Ashur-Nasir-Pal II (883-859 B.C.) states thai he had conquered the countries of Nairi and Kirhi in
the land of Subari, If some of the Nairian tribes were Subarians
obviously, the others, too» must have been so, We have seen earlier that the name Su-bir (Subari), by its very structure (with its component bir), belongs to the same group of Nairian tribal names as Ginzi-bir, Sini-bir(-ni), Ar-bcr ani), Turubcr(-an) and the like. This also proves that there was a connection
between the Nairians and the Subarians.
It is now clear that, the name Armavir (Arma-vir), loo, has Ihe same structure, with its component -wr, which is identical with the Nairian word birt meaning *iribe, house, city*. We know that the Nairian-Urartian b between two vowels changes to v in classical Armenian (cf. Erebuni>Erevan, Hbani>avan, etc.). Hence, Armabir has become Armav/r, which meant 'Arma's house or Arma's cityV
ARAH, 50. Instead of Babhi here was wmten Kurtt which is not accepted by ochers. 2
. Ibid. 179, 3
, Khorenatsi has preserved a concrete testimony (hat substantiates ihe meaning of Armavir as 'Arma's cily or Arma's house/ He writes: Armais built a
house for his habitation on a hill on the bank of the river and called it Armavir after his own name.11 (1-12,) Here it is explicitly slated thai Armais called the city he built Arma-v/r after his own name Arm |-is), Some authors still attribute Armavir, erroneously, to the Ervandumst for the reason that the name Armavir contains ihe stem Anna (of Armais), ihe basic component of the name Arma-ni (Arme~ni>Armen) by which are designated the Armenian land and people, and that the hypothesis of "the migration of the Armens" docs not allow them to accept the existence of the Armens in Armenia before ihe fall of the Urariian dynasty. Therefore, they do not accept that Armais was Urartian (we have already shown in our previous works that Armais is ArgiSti). Although the Ervandunis have kept Armavir as their capital for some time and have carried out some

W ARMENIA. SURARTU AND SUMER
Therefore, Armavir, being Armabir (Arma-bir) in its original form, belongs to the same group of Nairian names along wiih Su-birt Ginzi-bir, cic. This is another important proof showing the close relation that existed between Subir (the Subarians) and the Nairian tribes (hence the Arma[-ni] race) of the Armenian Highland.
I have already shown thai Su
r
ili and Amm
r
iB have been synonymous names of identical origin, where the components Su ( Subari) and Arma were equivalent terms. Present scholarship already accepts that the Subarians were in existence in the Armenian Highland in antiquity. The Subarian culture of the remote past corresponds to the culture of the Armenian Highland of the same period.
A number of ancient written and traditional Armenian narra
tives reported by Khorcnatsi and Sebeos testify also to the fact that there were kinship and religious lies between the tribes living in the southern parts of the Armenian Highland and those who lived in the central region (Hark') and the hinterland. In the time of King Astiages of Media, the Armenian king of the Ervanduni dynasty had one of his sons named Tigran and another Sabaris (SavarS). This last name which is widely used among Armen*
ians comes from the name Subari.
In ihc third millenium B,C- (and even before), the Subarians were spread all over Mesopotamia, including Assyria and Babylonia. Gclb states that "Subarian beginnings are lost in the darkness of the prehistory of Babylonia.04 It is accepted that before the appearance of the Semites, Assyria was inhabited by Subarians and ii was often called Subartu, even after the formation of the powerful Semitic state of Assyria. We would like 10 mention here, parenthetically, that if the name of the city of hlalwan/IJalman>Arman9 located somewhere between Nuzi and Diyala. did really have any (ethnic) connection with the

Those who anribute the founding and the naming of Armour to the Ervandunis, should either accuse Khorcnaixi forlyina and having fabricated the name Arma/j, or they mu i *ho» that amonf the Ervandunis there was at Icaat one king by the name Arma (AmuUsl. Obviously, they cannot do this, because no such king has existed in that dynasty. This shows the impasse in which the proponents of the "migration" hypothesis art found, the baseless and arbitrary interpretations they are forced to offer and the distortions they make in these important and decisive queMions related 10 the ancient history of the Armenian people.

name and ihe people of the great city-country of Armani/Armanum in the region of the sources of the Khabur river and in Armenian Mesopotamia, then we should not be surprised to find another city by that same name in that same region and belonging to the same people. Moreover, it is interesting to note in this connection, that ihc name of the city of Halwan/Halman in the region of Diyala
(i.e. neigbo
r
ing to Elam) reminds us of the form Harmanuia found in the Elamite text of the Behistun inscriptions that corresponds to
the name Armina of the Persian text.
As I have noted above, the Babylonian weighing-stone with cuneiform writings, discovered at Medzamor and dated the middle of the second millenium B.C., provides an important evidence for
the commercial relations that existed between Armenia and Babylon at that time. It may even indicate a probability for the existence of an Armenian colony in Babylon in those days, and the fact that in the 6Ib century B.C. Araha the Armin had become king of BabyIon, may lend support to the continued presence of such a colony.
The oldest legible Sume
r
ian documents are those found at Fara
(ancient Shuruppak) in Southern Babylonia. In these w
r
itings are mentioned men who bear the name Subur. The term Subur (=Subah) occurs often at Fara in such compound names as LuluSubur,
Tultul-Subur5 and the like, where Subur is used as an ethnic deter
minative. Gelb writes that "the name Subur at Fara was presumably
applied to real Subarians."*' In scholarship it is already accepted by many that in earlier limes, before the Sumerians. Southern Mesopotamia was inhabited by certain settlers whom archaeologists and historians call provisionally the Al-Ubaid people (after the name of the archaeological site now called Al-Vbaid). Judging from Ihe remains of earliest samples of pottery and other cultural fragments belonging to these people.-it is concluded that they have immigrated to Sumer in the 4500s B.C. or
even before.7
Now many scholars think that these first inhabitants of Sumer
may have been the Suba
r
ians. Here we wish to state the opinions of only a few of those who are authorities on the subject.

Sumerian cities, the names of Ihe Tigris and the Euphrates rivers (Idiglat and Buranum) and a series of words preserved in the Sumerian language (which are non-Sumerian, non-Semitic and non-Human) have all come from these first pre-Sumerian inhabitants. Landsberger calls Ihcm proto-Euphratcans, whereas S. Kramer writes:
The name of these prc-Sumcrian selllers of Sumer is of course unknown. They lived long before writing was invented and left no telltale records ... although it is barely possible
that at least some of them were known in the third millenium as Subarians.*
Writes Gclb:
Our earliest contact with Subarians may go back to the
f
irst antediluvian Sumerian dynasty, which is said to have resided at Eridu or. according to a variant text, at yA.AM. Since the name of ihe latter city, which is frequently mentioned in connection with Eridu, is given in Akkadian translation as Su-ba-ri and the like, it is possible that the city HA.AKI-Su-ba-ri of the first Sumerian dynasty was named
after the Suberians.'
These facts have directly echoed even in Sumerian epic poems. As we have already seen, the Sumerian epic tales quoted earlier inform us explicitly that on Enmerkar's demand (or request) metal- and stoncworkers came to Sumer from Aratta, bringing with ihcm gold, silver and building stones for the construction and decoration of
the temples in (hence, for the founding of) Ercch (Uruk) and E
r
idu,
Ihe oldest cities in Sumer.
In all these we can see a definite indication that the pre-Sumerian inhabitants of Southern Mesopotamia and their earliest settlements there consisted of colonies established by the natives of the Armenian Highland.

physical anthropologists have been unable lo reconstruct a clear picture of racial differences in either lime or space for the Near East in late prehistoric and ancient times. Datable finds have for the most part suggested minor variations on a generalized Mediterranean" type - a mixture of longheaded (dolicocephalic) and round- or broad-headed (brachycephalic) skulls.10
Then, bringing out from an Akkadian inscription a geographical scheme that reflects the Babylonian viewpoint (SUBAR is
North, SUMER is South, ELAM is East and AMURRU is West), they write that in Southern Mespotamia
the earliest intrusive stratum now appears to be the northern one, whichT following the native scheme, we may call the Subarian ... The language of this stratum has hitherto been known only from a few geographical names and lexical entries in later texts and from the names of persons identified as Subarians ... It may even clinch the arguments in favor of regarding the Subarians as the inventors of writing ... In ihe south, however, ihe Subarians were confronted about 3100 by a new stratum ... We may identify this stratum as the
Sumcrians,11
In recent years, new voices are being heard in scholarly circles
which seem to defend the idea that the homeland of the Proto-Indo
European language was not in Europe but in the Armenian Highland and its neighboring regions in Asia Minor*12 According to this theory, after the disintegration of the parent Indo-European language, those who spoke the various branches have migrated and spread out in all directions as their populalions have grown. Some of them, moving westward, have crossed Asia Minor and come to Europe; some passing through the Caucasus have gone north, and others
have moved to east-south toward the Iranian Plateau.
As I have pondered over these migrations in these three directions, I have considered it natural that some of these people would have certainly taken the southward march, moving straight down, in a direciion that provided easier passage by the courses of the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers. Linguists had placed the disintegration and

the branching off of ihe pareni Indo-European language around Ihe middle of the third millenium B.C.; but at that time the strong Sumero-Akkadian forces existing in (he south would have resisted Ihe migrating Indo-Europeans and prevented them from penetrating into that region. Our own research on Sumero-Armenian relations13 and certain linguistic and historiographic data revealed lately by others allow us to conclude thai the disintegration and the branching off of the Proto-Indo-European has taken place much earlier. It was in this much earlier period, then, lhal the people whom Landsberger calls Proto-Euphratean (or the Al-Ubaid people) must have come to Southern Mesopotamia and founded the first settlements. These are the people whom many authors now call Subarians (differentiating them, of course, from the Hurrians), Could it not be possible, then, that these Subarians would have belonged to those very same Indo-European people, who, in the time of the disintegration of the parent language, or later, would have moved gradually along the Tigris and the Euphrates to descend to Southern Mesopotamia?
I have mentioned above that the term yA.AKI is equaled in
Akkadian translations with Suba
r
i (Subir/Subur). It must also be mentioned that cpigraphers read the logogram t/A.AKI as Habur.u
Wc already know that in some Sumero-Akkadian documents the term StAA appears instead of Su-bir (or Su-bur); hence HA.A equals SU.A. that is. Ha equals Sti. It is possible to accept, therefore, that the 5u iribe was also called (or that the terms Su and #a were equivalent names). The Armenian people of yayasa were called by this very same name fa. In discussing the etymology of the word Ha-iasu in my book The Origin of the Armenian People (in Armenian), I have demons
trated that this word consists of the stem
t
fa and the component -iaSa, which in itself is a compound derivative, with affixes -ja and (They
had a city called t/a a by the reduplication of this stem
t
fa). Thus, it becomes evident that the original name of the people of Hayasa was Ha , the same as the name HA.A (=Ha-bur= *the Ha tribe'), by which the Suberians were called. In (his connection it is worthwhile
to compare the name of the Subarian deity AStupinu with yayasa divine name Unag-aStuaS (Astua$ of the Armenians), as well as the name of the Subarian god Lahuratil with the city of Lahurhila in Hayasa. We shall speak about these in detail later on. Compare also

the name of the cily of Cummaha of Hayasa with the city and the country of Cummafca in the Subarian region in the south, above Urfa; also the name of the city of AUi of Hayasa with Alzi of Subria. All these data lend stronger support to the probability that connections existed between the pre-Sumerian inhabitants (considered Subarian by some scholars) of Souihem Mesopotamia and those of the Armenian Highland (the Indo-European homeland) in the north. There is no complete unanimity as yet among scholars regarding the ethnic, geographic and political values that the names Subari, Hum'
,
Milanni. and Hanigalbat present, although some admit thai these terms generally denote the Hurrians, their language, their land or stale. Oihers are of the opinion that the terms Milanni and Hanigalbat have no ethnic significance. Writes Speiser: "Mitanni bad only a limited political application and never served as a comprehensive ethnic or linguistic designation. "l- Gelb concurs: "Mitanni was only the name of the state in central Mesopotamia ... its rulers and the name itself were probably Indo-European, and hence it should not be used as the name of a clearly non-lndo-Eurpean language. "I6 And he has this to say about Hanigalbat: "Hanigalbat is normally the Akkadian equivalent ofgeographic Mittanni proper. In later Assyrian sources it takes the place of Mittanni as a political term."17
We can conclude from all these, then, that the only terms that deserve our attention for their ethnic and linguistic value are Subari
and Hum. I
. Gelb. in his article "New Light on Hurrians and Subarians," writes the following in the light of his new discoveries:
... from now on it will be necessary to distinguish sharply between two entirely different and unrelated ethnic units: the Subarians. who from the earliest historical periods arc found not only occupying vast mountainous areas north of Babylonia but also living peacefully within Babylonia side by side with Sumerians and Akkadians, and the much younger Hurrians, who appeared relatively late on the Mesopotamian scene and who played an important role in the history of the
Near East in the middle of the 2nd millcnium B.C.'8

. THE UNIFICATION OF HURRIANS
WITH INDO-EUROPEANS AND THE
EXTINCTION OF THE HURRIAN LANGUAGE
We have seen above thai the Subarians were a people of the Armenian Highland and thai Armani, and later Arme (Subria) and Nairi, were part of Subariu.
We are still lacking accurate and specific knowledge about the people who lived in the central regions and the hinterland of the Armenian Highland before the establishment of the Urartian kingdom and about the cultural and politico-military aspects of their life, except those who lived in the southern and southwestern parts of this territory and were in contact with Sumero-Akkadians. Archaeological excavations in these regions have been casual and superficial, and the fragmentary (non-written) finds hardly reveal anything about these matters. With the exception of a fleeting glimpse given about Aratla in the Sumerian epic poems (at the beginning of the third millenium B.C.), this Highland generally remains dark for historiography until the times of Urartu. Even the most venturesome Sumerian kings, like Lugal Zaggisi of Umma, have not penetrated beyond Lake Van, and the few words they have left on record about such undertakings are quite insignificant. (For example, all that is said about Lugal-Zaggisi is
"
... he opened a straight way from the Lower Sea to the Upper Sea, through the Euphrates and the Tigris.")
We have seen that in the middle of the third millenium B.C. even
the commercial empire of Ebla was not able to expand to the Armenian Highland. On the map of her international relations her trade routes flanked it in the south and in the west, but never penetrated it. If I understand the term Armik' Arm/ki in the Ebla inscriptions
correctly as 'cities of the Ars'
, then it would be indicating only the Armeno-Subarian cities in the southern regions of the Armenian Highland.
The same thing can be said about the mighty kings of the great Akkadian dynasty. Even Naram-Sin's invasion (whereby he conquered Armani which "never since the creation of mankind has any king among kings taken") stopped short near Diyarbckir.19
19. Naram-Sin's victory monumem, now in the Istanbul Museum, was discovered (in situ) near Diyarbckir. See RISA. 141.



THE PEOPLES OF THE ARMENIAN HIGHLAND IN AKnOUfTY 91
Ii appears (hat before Urartu, the forces of the Assy
r
ian and the Hiitite empires have likewise been unable to penetrate the Armenian Highland- The Hitiites, on the yayasa side, have not gone any farther east than ihe province of Egegheats (around ihe city of Haha), and the only Assyrian king who moved the farthest at that time was Tiglath-Pilescr I (cir. 1100 B.C.) who waged war against the 23 Nairian kings (chieftains) living in the surroundings of Lake Van, and never went beyond Aradzani-20 As to the writings left by the Assyro-Babylonian and Hitihe kings about their invasions to the bordering regions of the Armenian Highland, they all consist of boastful expressions and self-praise and the information they contain is fragmentary, one-sided and tendeniious. Thus, it is very difficult to form a reliable picture of ihe cultural and socio-political conditions of the people living in the deep interior of the Armenian Highland, and siill more so to have an idea about their language and eihnic identity. The impenetrability of the Armenian Highland to the outside forces of the time can be explained not so much by the obstructive nature of its geography as by the military strength and cultural vitality of its people; the invading forces from ihe south and the west must have encountered great opposition, and also, the highlanders* reputation of being an unconquerable people must have acted as a deterrant. The existence of important centers, such as ArattaMedzamor, testify that as early as the beginning of the third millcnium B,C, the Armenian Highland had a well-developed culture and a strong industry, on a much higher level than hitherto assumedUnfortunately, no written documents have reached us from this pre-Urartian era. The reason, we think, is, probably, not because such documents do not exist, but because extensive archaeological excavaions have nol yet begun in the Armenian Highland, The greaier part of that territory, particularly its central regions which are the more important (Western Armenia), remain almost closed to archaeological research. Moreover, these archaeological sites arc found now under the rule of a power which is not interested in the discovery of documentary evidences related to the ancient past of the Armenian people.
Ahhough the uncovered Uranian inscriptions shed some light on the social and politico-military life of the peoples of their lime, they

remain silent on many other important questions. The reasons for this sparsity of information seem to be that, first, these writings - of which more than 400 are extent - consist of very brief and clich6-type
statements that do not contain much data about the ethnic (linguisticocultural) identity of the people, and secondly, the excavations of the Urartian archaeological sites have not been carried out with a wider and deeper scientific approach (or that the researchers did not have good luck). This is evidenced by the fad that so far in none of the
Urartian centers (Van, Toprakkale, Armavir- ArgiSti inili, TcyScbaini, etc.) have there been revealed any state archives; somelhing, that it is difficult indeed to imagine that a powerful and literate country with a strong administrative organization and international relations such as Urartu would not have possessed. In spile of all these, however, the inscriptions of the AssyroBabylonian kings make it clear for us that at least those parts of the Armenian Highland which they were able to penetrate (including the surroundings of Lake Van) were the homeland of the native Nairian tribes. The inscriptions of the Urartian kings, who called themselves "kings of the land of Nairi", reveal further that Urartu was a strong politico-military confederation formed by the Nairian tribes. Assyro-Babylonian inscriptions tell us that the northern mountainous regions of Subartu were also called Nairi. We have already seen that Tugulti-Ninurta I mentions Papfci, Kutmuhi, BuSSi, Mumnu§ Alzi, Madani, Niftani, Alaia, Tcburzi, Burukuzzi as countries of the
vast land of Subartu- It is obvious that all these countries that were
part of Subartu were mostly Nairian countries. Putting all these evidences together, we can rightly accept that before Urartu, Subartu and Mitanni also consisted of politico-military unions formed by
Nairian tribes.
Now then, what was the situation in the Armenian Highland in the third millemum B.C. and what transpired in the second and first millcniums, before (he eslablishment of ihe Urartian kingdom? We must say at the start that according to numerous linguistic, mythological and cultural evidences, the homeland of Indo-Europeans appears to be in Asia Minor and the Armenian Highland, stretching from central Anatolia to (he Caspian Sea. It was from here that, after the disintegration of the Proto-Indo-European language, various groups speaking different Indo-European dialects separated and migrated to Europe and Asia. (We shall speak about this in detail in our last chapter.)

Highland during the same period. Although some mute materials found in archaeological layers are assumed to be Humant but even if they arc, ihey may be a sign for the existence of some insignificant
Hurrian elements or the result of cultural diffusion or influece. Cuneiform documents in the Near East show that it was in the
second quarlcr of Che second millenium B.C.* when the Hurrians
crossed the Zagros range and moved, in great waves of migration, from the south of Lake Urmia to the plains of Assyria; then ihey entered in large numbers in Northern Mesopotamia and Norihern Syria, and from there penetrated into the Armenian Highland and Cilicia (Kizwatna).
It is evident that these Hur
r
ians, by their massive presence in Northern Syria and the southern regions of the Armenian Highland, have become, with Indo-Europeans, important participants in the formation of the great state of Miianni. I find that in this period of lime, a situation of bilingualism has developed in the Armenian Highland, the Hurrian language being utilized along with the IndoEuropean. There were, of course, other ethnic elements living there at the time, but as consequent developments show, ihey seem to have had no greai effect, neither in numbers nor in vitality, to play any decisive role. This massive Hurrian presence pertains, of course, only to the southern regions of (he Armenian Highland which were within the main circles of Miianni. It was here that they exerted considerable influence rather than in the interior of the highland where no Hurrian inscriptions are found related to the Mitannian period. It must be noted here, however, that although Armenian is an Indo-European language, a significant part of its vocabulary is not Indo-European, and it seems possible that an important portion of these non-IndoEuropean clcmenis may be Hurrian, suggesting, thus, Ihat in the times of Miianni, in certain parts of these regions, the Hurrian language was used as a second spoken language along with Armenian. All these direct and indirect evidences tend to suggest that the Armenian people consisted basically (not counting other small ethnic groups that were assimilated) of two major elements: the IndoEuropean natives and the Hurrian migrants, the latter being of no small consequence,



94 ARMENIA, SUBARTU AND SUMER
When we speak of the Indo-European homeland and the IndoEuropean-speaking peoples, we should not take these terms in their ethnic or racial meaning, but only in their linguistic sense> because it is possible that the Proto-Indo-European language was spoken in a general selling by peoples of different ethnic or racial origin and even belonging to different anthropological types, the dolicocephalic and the brachycephalic (Armcnoid)- The intermixing of peoples of different ethnic or racial groups is not a phenomenon of the historical period only. Such movements have taken place much earlier than the disintegration of the parent Indo-European language or even
much before its consolidation.
For example, Armenians and Hiltites belong, linguistically, to the Indo-European family and anthropologically they are both brachycephalic (Armenoid), a type to which belong also the Hurrians (who were earlier in (he southeast of the Armenian Highland, see Map 6) who are considered non-Indo-European. On the other hand, many members of the Indo-European family belong to the Mediterranean dolicocephalic type, to which belong also the Semites who are not Indo-European* This ethno-Iinguistic setting and certain archaeological and demographic phenomena show that the formation and the consolidation ofthe parent Indo-European language have taken place where the two anthropological types have come in contact with each other and intermixed. The consolidation of this language must have occurred during the few thousand years prior to the fourth millenium B.C. when the earth's population was sparse and the people lived in clans in the primeval phase of communal societies. That particular environment where this contact has taken place, Lc- the Indo-European homeland, included the central and eastern parts of Asia Minor, the Armenian Highland (extending to the Caspian Sea), Northern Mesopotamia and Northern Syria. The western part of this vast area, Asia Minor, was inhabited mostly by dolicocephalics in these early times, whereas in the east, in the Armenian Highland and specially in its central and southern parts, the inhabitans were mainly brachycephalic (the Hiltites and certain Armenian segments of Asia Minor must have moved from the east to the west).21 I find
2). Some argue that in matters pertaining to races it would be wrong to be guided by cranial forms and measures, since such characteristics arc subject to change under new geographic and climatic conditions. Such changes, however, may not become perceptible in 5-10 milleniums. We are dealing here with such

lhai what was known 10 (he Sumcro-Akkadians by the name Subari was none other than segments of these Armenoids living in the southern parts of the Armenian Highland where was also located the Armani mentioned by Naram-Sin. The overwhelming majority of Armenians arc brachyccphalic and this is the main reason why scholars have called this particular type
Armenoid* Armenians seem to have inherited it also from the Subar
ians, and their mixing with Hurrians, who also were brachyccphalic, has only served to the almost intact preservation of the Armcno/d type, If the brachyccphalic trait of the Armenians were to be attributed solely to their Human heritage, then it would have been necessary 10 assume that Armenians consisted, in large majority, of Hurrians and that the Armenian language of Indo-European origin was not their own native tongue, bul was imposed on them by the Indo-European minority. Existing evidences, however, do not substantiate such a hypothesis. It can be true only for the Human component of the Armenian people (and only in the case when it is proven definitively that the Hurrian language is not Indo-European). The apparent evidences confirm rather that, as mentioned earlier, the parent IndoEuropean language was consolidated in its cradle in Asia Minor and the Armenian Highland, where the two anthropological types, the western (dolicocephalic) and the eastern (Armenoid), came in contact with each other, long before the invention of writing, in prehistoric times, when the Armenoid Subarians were present in the land as natives. (The presence of anthropological differences among lndoEuropeans could have been possible only if their homeland were in this geographic environment.) This is one of the proofs showing that their homeland could not have been in Europe. The appearance of the Hurrian tribes in the Near East in the third and particularly the second millenium B.C. was actually the result of much later migrations occurred in historical times. In the days when they were first mentioned in the cuneiform inscriptions they were speaking the Hurrian language.
As we have seen, a number of scholars assert that Subarians are
not Hurrians. In an Ugaritic inscription discovered at Ra's Shamra (near Laiakia). we find the following three terms mentioned together:

Hri (Hum), tfr/ (yaii), and Sbr (Subari).22 Some authors accept this as a proof thai Hurrians and Subarians arc distinct and separate elements, whereas others, based on earlier opinions regarding (he Subari-Hurri equivalence, sec the Assyrians in the term Sbr (Subari)We are of Ihe opinion thai one should look at the Subarian question on the background of the fact that the Indo-European homeland is in Asia Minor, in the Armenian Highland and the neighboring regions of Northern Syria and Northern Mesopotamia. It was in these very same regions that Mitanni was mainly located. It is known in scholarship that the ruling class in the state of Mitanni carried Indo-European names and among the deities worshiped in Mitanni were Milra, Varuna, Indra, Nasatea, and other Indo-European (called Indo-Iranian) gods. Some authors present the question in such an aspect as to imply that the personal names and the deities called Indo-Iranian were not Indo-European and they generally formulate this question in a way as if that which is IndoIranian is different from Indo-European. The fact is that these names and the various deities called Indo-Iranian were all known in Subar
ian countries centuries before the migration attributed to IndoIranians. They were well known not only in the lands of Mitanni, but in the eastern shores of the Mediterranean and in Asia Minor. R
. O'Caltaghan has collected the following important data on
this matter:
It is most striking that a number of royal Mitanian names recur in ihe west, for example* Sudarna is dynast of MuSihuna, Sutadara is father of Aitagama Aitagama was a brother of Biryawdza, himself a chieftain ... SunaSQra, king of Kizwatna to the north of Cilicia, we find in northern Syria Sumida, possibly a chief of Carchemish, Abirata, prince of Barga, Swatiti, a man in Alalakh, and Patuzana, BSyawa and Tsitriyara, all Syrian princes. Coming south near the lower Oronies, there are Aitagama, dynast of Kadesh,
his father Sutadara
Continuing this list» O'Callaghan brings many more names of kings* princes and other important personalities from the above

memioned regions, then he concludes: "
... all the names of the
princes and patricians in Palestine and Syria referred to above, as well as the names from Mitanni and Nuzu, are of Indo-Aryan origin.1* How could one possibly accept the idea thai these Indo-European
names and the deities mentioned above could have come from Iran
and spread over the extent of Northern Mesopotamia* Northern Syria, the Armenian Highland, Cilicia and Asia Minor, in other words, the entire Indo-European homeland? Some scholars go so far as arranging things in such a way that Mitannians turn out to be also Hurrians; as if they constituted the last wave of Human migration, coming 10 the Near East from around Lake Urmia, and bringing with them certain Indo-lranian names and deities. This idea is devised, of course, to accomodate the preconceived and wrong hypothesis and conviction that the homeland of the parent IndoEuropean language was in Europe (formerly placed in Central Asia)
and thai Indo-Iranians had come from the north in the 2000s B.C.
According to this assumption it must have so happened that Mitannians, as "Hurrians coming from the east/' have met (or cohabited for some time), in some place around the Caspian Sea or Lake Urmia, with those Indo-Europeans who, coming from Central Asia
or the Caucasus, were on their move to the south, and thus have
borrowed from them certain **Indo-Iranian'* elements, ar a time when the latter were not yet even Indo-Iranians,
This whole structure breaks down, of course, when one admits
the fact that the Indo-European homeland was not in Europe and that Indo-Europeans were in existence in the Armenian Highland, Northern Mesopotamia, Northern Syria and Asia Minor, as well as in the northwestern end of present-day Iran much earlier than the second millenium B.C. (In fact they were there all the time.) Hence, it will be more correct to accept that Mitannians, too, were of these Indo-European natives who were called Nairians. In the times of Mitanni these people were utilizing for their writings the Hurrian language which seemed to have been gaining usage, along with (he Sumerian and the Akkadian, in those regions of the Near East where Hurrians were expanding.
It appears that the Hurrian, as a second language, must have been widely and actively used in the southern (Mitannian) regions of the Armenian Highland because of a massive Hurrian presence (not counting, of course, Nuzi, Ugarit and other Hurrian centers in
the Near East). On the other hand, there does not seem to be such



98 ARMENIA, SUBARTV AND SUMER
an active Human presence in the central and interior regions of the Highland (although certain Hurrian tribes had penetrated into these parts carrying with them their language). This could very well be the reason why we do not find in these regions of the Armenian Highland any Hurrian writings pertaining to the times of Mitanni
After MitanniT5 fall the Hurrians have started to mix with the
local people everywhere, with Semites in the south and Indo-Europeans in the north, and thus the Hurrian language has gradually declined and lost its currency and, eventually, within three or four centuries, has almost ceased to be a spoken language. It must be pointed out here that our knowledge about the time
interval between the fall of Milanni and the establishment of Urartu
is very scarce. The only thing which is nearly certain is that with the fall of Milanni the southeastern regions of its empire were inherited by Assyria, some regions in the west passed on to the Hittites, and in the main regions of the Armenian Highland small kingdoms and principalities came into existence which waged constant struggle of survival against the Hittitcs on the one side and the Assyrians on the other. These, however, did not have strong governmental struc
tures so as to be able to leave their own written records. We derive
some fragmentary information about them only from Assyrian and Hittite inscriptions which are one-sided and tendentious and speak
only of their own successes. Here is, then, the epic of Hayk and Bel, which, as the popular and traditional reflection of these events, expresses, in the historiographic style of the time and in mythological form, the written and traditional reminiscences of the heroic struggles of the Armenian people against the inlrustions of their Assyro-Babylonian enemies,24 This Armenian tale preserves the faint memories of events of those ancient limes, when, after the destruction of Mitanni, the southern
remnants of her rulers were forced before the onslaught of new Semitic immigrations (of the Suti and the Aflame tribes, later called Aramaeans) and under the pressure of a growing Assyria to retreat from their southern positions to a strategically stronger and more defensible highland in the north. The eastern branch has retreated from around Arrapha (Kirkuk), Nua and ASSur and moved upstream along the Tigris, toward Korduk* (Kardu)* This movement finds expression in the epic of Hayk,

where Ihe notorious chieftain, with his son Aramaneak and all his
followers, moves from Assyria (in the epic from "Babylonia," obviously influenced by the Biblical legend of the Tower of Babel, or, indeed, because of Armeno-Subarian settlements in Babylonia) to the land of Ararat/ (Uruairi). The western branch, in its turn, has moved from Ugaril and Hama, in the directions of the Oronies, ihe Ephrates and the Khabur. and retreated to the north. Thus, ihey have settled in the mountain belt that separates the northern highland from [he plains in the south, now turned Semitic, alongside with their kindred Nairian tribes, in Musasir (Matiene), UruatriArarad (Korduk), Kadmuhi, Alzi (Aghtznik*), Kommagene and the neighboring mountainous regions which formed the southern parts of the Armenian Highland. The eastern branch has established its center in the Uruatri
mountains ("Ararad" in Khorenatsi) while the western branch has
formed strong unions at Hanigalbat, Arme-Subria and $upani (Dzopk*), sometimes fighting and other times joining (he so-called
Hitlile federation,
The Nairian (Indo-European-Human) tribes of the eastern branch
were able to form a notable union around Uruairi thai could resist
Assyria, a union (hat eventually became the nucleus of the mighty Urariian state (hat was to be established later; nevertheless, these
tribes of the Uruatrian union, being within (he range of intrusions of the Semitic enemy forces in the south and by their shifting practice of uniting and dissolving, could not create a power (hat would be a match for growing Assyria.

They did not occupy a proper place in history and did not leave an aulhographic (race. In order to avoid Assyria's constant encroachments and exhausting pressures, they were forced to move their center of resistance to farther north, to the region of Lake Van and Hark*
. (This is all that is embodied in the epic of Hayk and BeK) It was here (hat in (he firs( quar(er of the 9 century B.C these Nairian tribes were able to achieve a strong and centralized union and formed the kingdom of Urartu which, as we learn from Assyrian inscriptions, in the time of Arame had already become strong enough to begin to disturb Assyria. We know that the Urartian kings called themselves **king of the

land of Nairi." ll is evident, therefore, that Urartu was a confedera
tion or a politico-military union of Nairian tribes. And what was the ethnic origin and language of the rulers of Urartu? Indications point to the fact that these, toot like the rulers of Mitanni, were Nairians of Indo-European origin. Although in the middle of the second millcnium B.C., in the times of Mitanni. certain Human tribes have penetrated into the central regions (Hark*) and the hinterland of the Armenian Highland and,
as inhabitants in the land of Nairi, have also become Nairians, never
theless, as I have noted, they did not have the importance and vitality lhat their kinsmen had in the southern regions. It is obvious lhat by the time Mitanni fell, three or four centuries later, these people as well as their kinsmen in the south, must have already been assimilated by the Indo-European Nairians and almosi ceased to be Hurrian
speaking. It was in this period that the Armenian people was formed as an Indo-European-speaking people. I would like to cite here a number of evidences in support of this
assertion:
I
. The epic of Hayk and Bd testifies that when Hayk <Haldi) moved his dwelling site (the country's administrative center) from Ararad (Uruatri) to Hark4 (the region of Lake Van), tfor (the Hurrian tribe) was the brother of Hayk*s eldest son Aramaneak (the Armens).2*
2
. Even if the designation of Arame (called Aram by Khorenatsi), the founder of the Urartian kingdom, as the patriarch of the Armenians, is not accepted as an important indication in this question, still the names Armais ( = ArgiSti) and Aramaneak ( = Erimena) are sufficient to affirm (he Armenian origin of the Urartian dynasty. Moreover, the names of the other Urartian kings are not Hurrian either.
3
. The false migration hypothesis of the Armens still prevents . certain authors from seeing the correct connections between the Armens and Urartu. Considering the Armens as settlers, these authors assume that they have entered Urartu in the days of her decline and even later. The fact is, however, that Urartu was their own country and there are important indications to this effect in the inscriptions of Darius. In the trilingual Behistun writings, where the Akkadian and the Elamite texts arc the direct translations of the Persian original, the name Armina (Armeni) in the Persian original is rendered UraStu, that
26. Khorenatsi. 1-12.



THE PEOPLES OF THE ARMENIAN HIGHLAND IN ANTIQUITY 101
is. Urartu (with the r>S transition) in the Akkadian translation. This proves that the name UraSlu (Urartu) was synonymous or equivalent to the land-name Armina (Armcni).
4
. Darius mentions in the same inscriptions that a certain Armin (an Armenian) by ihe name Arafja. fjaldita's son. had become king of Babylon. He writes:
[thus] says Darius: When 1 was in Persia and Media, the Babylonians rebelled against me for the second time. A man by the name Araha, an Armin. yaldita's son, rebelled in Babylon. In a place called Dubala he lied to the people [saying): '1 am Nebuchadnezzar, the son of Nabonidus.' Then the people of Babylon rebelled against me and took the side of Araha. He occupied Babylon and became king in Babylon.-'
We see here explicitly stated that the father of this Araha Ihe Armin (Armenian) was called Haldita, a name (Haldi-la) thai incorporates the name of the Urartian supreme national god Haldi. Darius mentions Arafea in 520 B.C.. that is. 65-70 years after Urartu's defeat (590-585 B.C.). A comparison of the dates reveals that Araha's grandfather must have lived in the last days of Urartu and witnessed her fall. Here is. then, an Armenian who lived in the days of Urartu and named his son after (/a/d/. Urartu's supreme national god. If this Armenian were not a genuine son of Urartu. but belonged instead to a foreign enemy race and had come with the Medes who destroyed Urartu, he certainly would not have called his son (Araha's father) Haldi-ta by the name of Ihe supreme national god Haldi of his enemies. This is then a crying evidence that this Armenian was an Urartian. To think that Araha's grand
father was a "non-Armenian" Urartian. but after Urartu's defeat
his son, accepting the nationality and the religion of their "foreign
adversaries"
, had become Armcnianized. and that this happened
under Median rule, is at least unreasonable.
It is as clear as day that Urartians were Armenians who worshiped Haldi. We already know that Haldi is Hayk. the selfsame hero (the patriarch of the Armenians) who fought against Bel (the Assyro-Babylonian god). And this Armenian has named his son
t
faldi-ta. just as many Armenians have named and continue to name their sons Hayk-ak or simply Hayk.
27. British Muwum. S/DG. 56-59.



ARMENIA, SLBARTU AND SUMER
II is not impossible either, that by the expression "yaldita's son' Darius might have explicitly indicated Ihe Ijaldian origin of Araha the Armin (the Armenian), that is, his being a Haldian Urartian (or a son of Haidi of Urartu). It is known that in pagan times each individual in a given tribe was considered to be the son of that tribe or the son of the principal god of that tribe. As we have seen earlier, King David of the Hebrews, in order to indicate the nationality of the Armenian king Adrazar of Dzopk', calls him "son of Ara." which corresponds exactly to the meaning of the word Armcn (Ar-mel-ni]), 'sons of At' or 'sons of Ara'. Thus, the expression "A man by the name Arabia, an Armin, tfaldita's son" can be understood to signify that Araha ('Araian') the Armin was a Haldian man who belonged to the Urartian people; in other words, by the term Annn one should understand Haldian-Uranian, just as by the term Armina Darius undertstood Ura$tu (Uranu). It is actually immaterial whether by the expression "Haldita's son*' Darius referred to Araha's physical father or to his belonging to the tribe whose god was Haldi. In either case the meaning is the same: This Armenian belonged to the Urartian people and the main Urartian people were Armenians.
Urartu and Babylon must have become old friends during their age-old struggles against bloodthirsty Assyria. It is conceivable. therefore, that an Urartian prince could have led a Babylonian rebellion against Darius and been accepted by the Babylonians as an auihority of royal-divine origin and become their king. It is even probable
thai Araha could have been the leader of an Urartian mission sent
by the Urartian Armenians to open a second front against Darius' rule in Babylon and who could have succeeded to raise against him the friendly Babylonian people who shared their destiny.
5
. From Darius* same inscription we learn that at that lime UraStu-Armina, too, had rebelled against him and was engaged in a liberation war against the Persian armies placed under the command of two generals. DadarSiS and Vaumisa. Now, if these Armenians (the Armins) were those who had been placed as rulers in Urartu by Ihe Medes and had remained in their positions under the patronage of the Achaemenians, then why would they rebel, and furthermore. given "the presence of enemy Urartians," why would ihey cause to alter a situation that was so much "in their favor"? It becomes very clear, therefore, that these Armenians were Urartians who had been defeated by the Medes and who had rebelled now to restore their former Urartian independence.

8
. The costumes in which the Armenians are pictured in the sculptures of Xerxes' palace in Perscpolis are exactly the same as those of the Urartian delegates depicted on a sculpture in Ashurbanipal's palace in Nineveh.
9
. We know that the Armenian kings were buried in the Egegheats region. An Urartian royal tomb discovered at Ahin Tepc shows thai in that region the Uranian burial tradition and customs were continued by the Armenian kings who succeeded the Urartian Aramian dynasty. This, loof proves the uninterrupted continuaiion of the native spiritual culture. 10, A number of place-names from Urartian times have been preserved almost intact. Examples are: Alzinini-Aghtznik, EnzitAntzit, Supani-Dzopk1, Hanigalbat/ anirabat-Kharberd/Kharput (?)v Melidu-Malatia, Urartu-Ararat, Arsuniuini-Ar$runi( Biaina-Van, Erebuni-Ercvan, Dayaeni-Tayk4, Tariuni-Daruynk1, Cumma aKamakh, Alzini-Eriza-Erzinjan, Idiglat-Tigris, Buranun-PurattuEphratt Arsania-Arasani, Ahuriani-Ahurian, Suinia*Sevan, etc, etc. 11. During the one or (wo decades that elapsed between the fall of the Urartian dynasty (590-585 B.C.) and the accession to power of Ervand I (570 B-C.) no changes have occurred in the Urartian population and there has been no massive influx of foreign settlers who could have altered the language of the country. Had the language of the country been changed in such a short period of time (something very unlikely), it would have only been 10 the language of the new supreme rulers, the Medes and the Persians. But Armenian is neither the language of the Medes nor the Persians. Hence, it must be accepted that it was the native tongue of the country that was preserved, thai is» the tongue of the Nai

Highland in the second millenium B,C- and gaining an important proportion introduced bilingualism in the country, have been subjected, after (he fall of Mitanni, to the linguistico-cultural influences of the native population and have gradually, within three or four centuries, almost ceased to be Human-speaking. Nevertheless, they must have continued to use a Hurrian dialect in certain temples (like the one at Musasir) for ceremonial purposes and also specifically as a language of inscriptions. This could apparently be the reason why, in Urartu, Sarduri Ts official documenis, written first in Assyrian* were switched, in Upuini's time (probably because of feelings of increased hostility against Assyria), to a Human-like dialed thai was found preserved in one such temple.
12. The fact thai such a dialect was utilized for these official
writings is disturbing certain scholars to accept that the ruling Nairian people in Urartu were Indo-European-speaking; on the other hand, these same scholars, knowing real well that basically in Mitanni the Hurrian language was extensively used for writing, do not suspect the Indo-European origin of Mitanni*s ruling class. Moreover, this was at a lime when the Hurrians formed a disiinct and particular elemeni in Mitanni's government structure and their tongue was in current usage in the country as an important second language. In
Mitanni, other than stale records, there were also numerous scripts written in Hurrian by common, Hurrian-speaking people whereas in Urariu we do not find any such popular writings, proving thai the Urartian language was not, in fact, so much a spoken language in the limes of Urariu. These people used a kind of simple hieroglyphic signs which sufficed for their common and minor transactions
13, If the Nairians who formed Urartu had been Hurrian
speaking in those days, they would have certainly remained so in the days of the Ervandunis and the Ariashessians, since the population of the country did not change*
The Urartian rulers, even after Sarduri I, could have continued
to write their inscriptions in Assyrian and no one would have suspected them to be Assyrians. Likewise, in the times of ihe Ervandunis
and the Artashessians, Armenians have utilized the Aramaean, the Persian and Ihe Greek languages and no one has considered ihem
to be Aramaean, Persian or Greek.
A certain misunderstanding has taken root in some scholars based on the mere assumption that there has been in ihe region of Van a particular tribe called Urart, Biait or Hald, that has wielded power.



THE PEOPLES OF THE ARMENIAN HIGHLAND IN ANTIQUITY 105
Supposing thai Urarlu was the name of a particular tribe, these scholars began to look for the traces of '"this lribek> in Uranu and in the surrounding countries- Coming across the Al-Artan mountaineers in the region of Khut-Sasun mentioned by Arabic authors, and carried away by the slight similarity of the name» they considered them to
be the remnant of the "Urartian tribe-'1 The fact is that the name
Al-Artan has no connection with the name Urartut the latter having already generated the name Ararat. The prefix Al of Al-Artan is a definite article in Arabic, corresponding to "the" in English

Removing the aiticle, we arc left with Artan which, with its one syllabic with r cannot be linked with (he name Urartu (Ararat) which has two syllables with r and where the n of Anan is absent. The name Arran is closer to Ardini, Eridiani, and other similar forms, rather than Urartu, but no one thinks of
connecting it with them. The same can be said about the Ortaians
of the Amzit region in whom some, likewise, see the "Urartian lr bc-,, It must be noted* first, that the Antzit region was not part of Urartu proper, and, secondly, if one is in search of a term phonetically close to Orfa(ians), instead of going to Urartu (which has already gi en Ararat), one can look closer at Oltu (northwest of
Erzurum) or Ordu (west of Trabizon), Thus, one must not be carried away by incidental similarities in names and derive weighty conclusions without substantiating evidences* I have shown earlier and will show again in the sections of Ervandunis and Biaina that the names Urartu and Biaina arc only geographical terms and do not have any ethnic significance, and that IJukU has never been Human, It must be clear, then, that in the limes of Urartu, the Nairians whose kingdom was Urartu, were already organized as an Indo-European-speaking people. 14. According to ancient Armenian philological data, the Nair* ian tribes mentioned by Assyrian and Urartian kings in the second and first milleniums B.C* come to the scene of action during the Armenian Arshakuni dynasty as distinct feudal principalities (Nakhararutiun). such as. Daiaeni~Tayk\ Abiliani-Abeghian, ArsumuimAr$runi, Abuni-Havnuni, Eriabi'Shirak, Abaeni-Apahuni* AlzininiAghtznik\ $upani~Dsopk\ etc. It must be accepted, therefore, that most of the Armenian principalities descended from the Nairian tribes of the Armenian Highland, with some of the smaller ones being merged into the structure of the larger ones. Their territories extended from Lake Urmia to the Euphrates in

Mosl of the Armenian dialects known to us have so many differences in their phonetic and morphological characteristics and in grammar compared to ancient classical Armenian (grabar) that it is difficult to consider
them derived from it.
Some assert that when the Armenian alphabet was invented there were no separate dialects and that these dialects were formed from
'grabar' only after the fifth century. This would mean that from the time the Armenian language was separated frorr he Proto-IndoEuropean until the invention of the alphabet by NU iop, for a span of a few thousand years, either no changes have occurred in the language or it has gone through the same phases of development in every particular and isolated region of the Armenian Highland, and, preserving everywhere its morphological and phonetic integrity, has not given rise to any branch or dialect; and suddenly* after the invention of the alphabet (under the relatively stabilizing effect of literacy), the language has begun to change and produced many branches and dialects! Il is very difficult indeed lo subscribe to such an irrational assumption.
The differences that exist between some of the Armenian dia
lects are just as great as those existing between the various branches of present-day major languages of the Indo-European family (say Latin, Iranian or Slavic). Even certain Armenian dialects are unintelligible to each other. Some of them contain grammatical elements and vocabulary that arc not proper to .grabar*
. These facts suggest that the separation of the Armenian dialects from the mother tongue must have taken place in a much earlier time. As rightly observed by Prof. R. Ishkhanian, "Il is entirely possible to call the Armenian dialects a subgroup of Armenian languages within the Indo-European family.""

It musl also be noted here that these dialects could not have
evolved into such differences and maintained their identity if the people who spoke them had not been isolated in the long past and remained on their own and permanent territories as distinct popu
lation units. There is no doubt, therefore, that most of the Armenian feudal
principalities, with their territorial and linguistic distinctiveness, have been (he heirs of the Nairian tribes of the Armenian Highland. We can affirm, then, that the language of the Nathan tribes was mainly Indo-European and that the various branches of their language belonged to a subgroup of native Armenian languages within the IndoEuropean family, 15. We have already shown above that the word bir (and its variant ber), meaning Hribe, house, city'
, is a native Nairian word
which occurs in Nairian place or tribal names, such as, Ginn-bir, Sini-bir-ni, Turu-bcr-an, Ar-ber-ani and Arma-bir (Armavir) and
it is an Indo-European word, When the word bfr is used as a terminal affix in place-names, it loscslhe/by the addition of thetoponymic suffix -/a (.bir + ia = -bria)t like5u~bjr>Su-6rxa. The names of the Subarian cities Alla-bria (south of Lake Urmia) and ISpili-bria (ISpilibria) are formed in this manner.
H
. Karagyozian speaking in one of his works about ISpilibria in the region of Kashiari, compares the -bria ending of this name with the names of a number of Thraco-Phrygian cities (such as Mesambriat Skelabria, PoUiobria9 Mesembria, Kombria, Menebria9 Sclimbriat Timbria and Salambria) and he concludes that the word bria
is Indo-European.29 We may consider it certain, then, that bir is an Indo-European word. The form bria, with its -/a ending, is of much later occurrence than the main root b/r (in toponymic names the -ia ending occurs generally in later periods), for example, the ancient name 5u*Wr appears as Su-bria (<Subir + ia) in much later times. Therefore, the presence of (his word in Subarian-Nairian tribal and place
names in its most ancient and correct form bir is an indication
showing the location of the Indo-European homeland. This proves also that the Nairian tribes, many of whom had names containing the word b/r, spoke an Indo-European language. Hence, the tribe Allabria, too, was Indo-European.

16. The suffixes -ni and -am added to the Indo-European componeni bir (or ber) in some of these names (Sinibir-ni, Afber-ani, Turuber-ani etc.) are of a later stratum and may be Hurrian or NairianArmenian endings. Even though these endings arc found in the Hurrian language, their existence in Armenian is already shown in Chapter I, Section 6. 17. As additional proof, there is also the fact that place-names such as ArgiStibinili, Menuafiinili, Rusafyinili. Sardurifjurda. ArgiStiuna, found only in the language of official records, have not been preserved; the reason being that they did not belong to the common and current language spoken by the people. As an example, we know that instead of ArgiStibinili, the people has preserved the name Armavir, because it belonged to their current Nairian-Armenian
language. 18. We can also mention the fact that no significant linguistic changes are observed between the earliest and the latest Urartian inscriptions even though some 200 years separate them. This shows that the language used for these inscriptions was not the spoken language of the time, otherwise it would have certainly undergone some noticeable changes. 19. We already know that Hayk (the ancestor-god of Armenians) who defeated Bel (the Assyro-Babylonian enemies) in battle with his bow and arrow is none other than yaldi. Here is an evidence from
Urartian inscriptions that speaks about this: "DHaldini uStabi masi
nic c'ssune karuni KUKaSSur hurad/e. ">0 ("yaldi came out [for
invasion] with his arm, conquered the Assyrian army.") It is clear that Hayk-Haldi was the god of Nairian Armenians, who ruled In Urartu, but in those days the language of the Urartian inscriptions was not their spoken language. And, as we have seen, many of these Nairian tribes, especially the leading ones, appear later as Armenian feudal principalities (Naghararutiun) in the structure of the Armenian kingdom of the Artashessian and Ihe Arshakuni dynasties. 20. There is an Important document of the fifth century, from ihe days of Catholicos Sahak, which fortunately has reached our time. It is the list of 70 Armenian feudal houses recorded in their sitting order around the king's throne in a royal assembly {gahnamak. quihQuufmlj, 'throne list').31 It is clearly seen in this list that those

. THE ERVANDUNI DYNASTY
The history of the fall of the Uranian kingdom (more precisely, the Uranian dynasty) is still in the dark. It is assumed that the Mcdcs, with the cooperation of some Armenians (probably some Nairian tribes discontented with the treatment of the Uranian kings), have conquered Urartu and put an end to her. The supposition regarding the part played by the Nairian tribes in the downfall of Urartu, plausible as it may appear in its general sense, does not shed any light on the ethnic identity of the Ervanduni dynasty which succeeded the Urartian dynasty. It is clear that the name Ervand (Ervanduni) is a family name, but the problem of its ethnic identity remains obscure because of the scarcity and vagueness of available information and il continues to be a subject of controversy. Some authors, attributing a decisive significance to the marriage relations that the Ervandunis established in later years with the Achaemenians, and particularly having in view the erroneous attempts of searching the origin of the name Ervand in the Persian language, are inclined to ascribe Persian origin to this dynasty. This, however, could not be possible, because, after the fall of the Uranian dynasty in Armenia (590-585 B.C.). when the Ervanduni Kingdom, including the same Urartian terriiories, was, in (he days of Astiagcs (584-553 B.C.). under the suzerainty of the Medes and not the Persians, the Medes certainly would not have placed on the throne of Urartu they had just conquered one of their rival or opponent Persians.- those Persians who in three years of bloody battles and under Cyrus* leadership would have ovenhrown the Median
rule in 553 B.C. 1' ' * i * * * * . - :



110 ARMENIA, SUBARTU AND SUMER
This very uncertainty about the ethnic origin of the Ervanduni dynasty and the futile attempts of searching the etymology of the name Ervand in the Persian language have been a major contributing factor of misunderstanding in historiography, distorting the circumstances of (he transition of power from the Aramian52 to the Ervanduni dynasty in Urartu and throwing entirely off the track the history of
Urartu and that of subsequent periods. I would like to share here some of my new observations that may
help to throw light on this very important question. Let me say first, thai the Medes, after defeating Urartu and aiming al greater imperialistic expansions towards the interior of Asia Minor, would not have deemed it wise to place a foreigner on the throne of Urartu. Such an act would have been extremely provocative and
offending to a brave and proud people of great traditions, like the Nairian people, whose military assistance (or, at least, neutrality)
they would have certainly needed for their future expansions. Therefore, the Medes would have placed on the throne of Urartu a prince who either was a non-direct descendant (a relative) of the Urartian dynasty or belonged to one of the principal Nairian tribes that
founded Uruatri and later Urartu.
What concerns the origin of the name Ervand, my investigations show that this name, as a royal name linked with the Ervanduni family and their land, is much older than generally accepted. 1 find
that the name Er-vand is derived from the Sumerian name Ur-banda. This name is found in the well-known Hillite inscription that speaks about Naram-Sin's 17 enemies; it occupies the ISth place in that
list of kings, where we read: - mUr-Ib]a-an-da LUCAL KUR,"tuNi-ik'ki[...Pi ("Ur-banda, king of the land of the city of Ni-ik-kif...] ") The last part of the name Ni-ik-ki[...] Is on the damaged portion
of the tablet and is obliterated. I find that this missing part must have contained the syllables -pa or -ip-pa and the full name must be read Ni-ik-ki-ip-pa (Nikipa or Nikippa). In an inscription that speaks about Sargon H's invasion from Assyria to Mana and Urartu, this place-name Nikippa is mentioned as the name of a mountain. The Ur component of the name Ur-banda should be compared
32. Although 1 find thai all the Urartian kings descend from Aiame, whether ihey do so or not is immaterial for our present discussion. Here I have called
ihem all Aramian after Arame's name (Aram in Khorenaisi). 33. AHDzU, II.



THE PEOPLES OF THE ARMENIAN HIGHLAND IN ANTIQUITY 111
with Ur-Ningirsu. the son of King Gudea of Gutium (a region in the Zagros mountains) and with Ur-Bau, the name of the priest-king of Lagash; and the word banda should remind us of the name of that herald. Lugal-banda ('junior-king1 or 'king's support, assistant*) whom Enmerkar, the king of Erech, sent to Aratta. We know that the initial b in Urartian and other ancient languages is changed to the sound v in Armenian, like Biaina>Van. Similarly, the -banda component of Ur-banda is changed to vand and Ur-banda is pronounced as Er-vand (Ervand). The location of the city-country Nikippa of King Ur-banda is approximately known by means of the information supplied in Sargon H's inscriptions about his expedition to Mana and Urartu. Here 1 quote the translation of those portions of the inscriptions which
interest us:
I departed from Gala)), my royal city and had a rough passage across the Upper Zab at its first flood. The third day I made the solemn promise to Enlil and Ninlil ... Whereupon I caused the armies of Shamash and Marduk to jump across the Lower Zab, whose crossing is difficult, as (if it had been) a ditch. Into the passes of Mount-Kullar, a high mountain range of the land of the LullumT,-which they (also) call the land of Zamua. I entered. In the Sumbi district 1 held a review of my army; ... I directed the line of march into the mountains. Against the land of Zikirtu and Andia I guided the yoke (i.e. the chariot) of Nergal and Adad, (whose) emblems go before me. Between Mount Nikippa and Mount Upa, high mountains. covered with all kinds of trees.... I marched. The Buia River, which (flows) between them I crossed ...,4
In addition to this, Sargon writes:
... from the district of Sumbi I went in between Nikippa and Upa, steep mountains. Toward Urartu, Zikirtu (and) the Mannean land, Nairi and Musasir, I marched victoriously ...3i
All these indicate that Mount Nikippa, still preserving the name

of King Ur-banda's cily-country since the times of Naram-Sin, was located in the southern pan of Musasir-Ardini> north of Lullubi and
Allab
r
ia and approximately in the southeastern region of the presentday city and mountains of Revanduz. In fact, the name Re-vandiuz)
seems to be a distinct reflection of Ihe name Ur-banda>Er-vandr
and it is not unlikely that it may even be the city of Nikippa itself, Ihe central city of Ur-banda. All these evidences show that after the lapse of more than two thousand years, from the times of Naram-Sin to the Ervanduni dynasty that succeeded the Aramian dynasty in Urartu, Ihe whole region of Musasir-Ardini (as well as Uruatri, called Ararad by Khorenaisi, and Hayots Tzor ['Armenians' Valley'] called also Ervandunik)
continued to belong to the Ervanduni family, This explains also the reason why in the Shahname the Tigris river (evidently the Eastern Tigris that originates in this homeland of the Ervandunis) is called Arwand 6 There are more historiographic evidences supporting this fact. Academician S, Eremian writes the following:
A number of indirect evidences lead us to (he conclusion that the Ervanduni dynasty originated in the (erriiory of ArdiniMusasir» neighboring on Matiene-Mana, the northeastern mountainous parts of which were included first in the kingdom of Urartu and later in the composition of Armenia. Pliny speaks about the Orondes tribe that lived in (his country, in the east of the city of Gaugamela. This coincides with the region of present-day Revanduz, According to H, Manandian, the name of one of the districts in Vaspurakan» Aruantunik (Ervandunis) must have been related to the people of Oroandes, This same district was also called Hayots Tzor ('Armenians' Valley') and was to the south of the city of Van, in the valley of the Hayots Tzor (Khoshab) river. The Ervanduni feudal dynasty, the hereditary princes of that district, continued to exist until the seventh century A.D.57
From Assyrian and Urartian inscriptions it is well known that the yaldian temple of Musasir-Ardini was the principal religious center
36. H, Adjarian, Dictionary of Armenian Personal Names (in Armenian), entry
Ervand. 37. HZhP. 439-440,



THE PEOPLES OF THE ARMENIAN HIGHLAND IN ANTIQUITY 113
of Urartu, just as Etchmiadzin is for present-day Armenians, and there arc indications that this yaldian temple was in existence even before the founding of Urartu, in the early Uruatrian, and, probably, Mitannian times. Otherwise, the Urartian kings would have established their main religious center in TuSpa-Van or in Argifiubinili-Armavir. This shows thai the Aramian dynasty of Urartu must have had kinship ties with the ruling house and the people of Musasir-Ardini. In this connection we are reminded of the bewailing of Rusa I of Urartu for the pillage of the treasures of the Haldian temple in Musasir by Sargon. There are already sufficient evidences to admit that Urualri was Urartu s nominal and political predecessor, where the politicomilitary union-nucleus formed by the Nairian tribes was forced to move farther north under Assyrian pressure and was established in the region of Lake Van (in Hark* according lo Khorenatsi).
In view of all these considerations, I think that the Medes, after
defeating Urartu (whose last king of the Aramian dynasty and his direct heirs seem to have been killed in that great battle) could not have appointed a foreigner to rule a brave and proud people of great military and governmental traditions. Instead, as I have already said, in view of assuring the cooperation of these valiant Nairian tribes for their future expansions, the Medes would have agreed lo the enthronement of one of the non-direct descendants of the Aramian dynasty or a prince from one of their kindred Nairian*Armenian tribes. And, as it is clearly seen, this person has been a prince of the Ervanduni family of the Musasir area, who were near neighbors to (and perhaps had cooperated with) the Medes living in Mana and in its east.
Thus, it is clear that with the succession of the Ervandunis to the
Aramian dynasty, no ethnic change has occurred in Urartu's rulership and Tu5pa-Van continued to be the capital of the country. It must be accepted, therefore, that the Armina of the Ervanduni dynasty was the continuation of the state of Urartu which continued to be called UraStu (=Urartu) in the Assyro-Babylonian language. The only (non-ethnic) change was that Urartu-UraStu had become now a tributory, first, to the Medes, and later, with interruptions, to the Achaemcnians. However, in the days of King Artashes I (of Armenians) she recovered her total Urartian independence and extending her sovereignty over the entire former Urartian territories and continuing to preserve the Ervanduni lineage, she regained, eventually, in the days of Tigran II the power of the era of ArgiSti L We already know that King Artashes I, by his own explicit admission,



114 ARMENIA, SUBARTU AND SUMER
belonged to the Ervanduni family, being, probably, a non-direct des
cendant of UraStu-Armina's Ervanduni dynasty.
It must be concluded, therefore, that in the Armenian Highland, Ihe Armenian kingdom Armina of the Ervandunis (and the Ervandid Artashessians) was the direct continuation of Urartu without undergoing any ethnic change in her ruling class. This means that the state
of UrartU'UraStu has continued to exist from the time of Arame
(860 B.C.) to that ofErato (I A.D.) in the same linguistico-gcographic environment, as a politico-military confederation of the same NairianArmenian tribes, which later became the feudal (Nakharar) houses. As it was shown above, the royal name Ervand (hence the Ervanduni family) descends from the times of Naram-Sin. Ur-Banda's ancestors and their tribe must have surely existed in their city*counlry Nikippa (in the region of Revanduz, north of Indo-European AUabria) at much earlier limes and, I think, that they were none other than the Naihan Subarians (for their location see Map I). In fact,
we know that Armani was located in the land of Subari and also that
one of the sons of Ervand I was called T/gr-an after the name of the Tigr-h river 38 (called Arwand in the Shahname) and another Sabaris (>Shavarsh) after Subari, The antiquity of Ur-banda (the Ervanduni dynasty) helps also to explain the fact that in the Zend and Sanskrit languages the word arwand is preserved as meaning .swift-moving (horse)f or 'braved Certain Indo-European groups (later called Indo-lranian) living in and in the cast of Mana in those ancient days, must have carried with them the fame of the Ervanduni horsemen (reminding of the Marianni warriors of Mitanni of later period) as they migrated to
the Iranian Plateau and from there to India.
The fact that the territory of the Ervanduni family must have extended, even in Ihe older days, from the Nikippa mountains to the region of Lake Van, including the district of "Hayots Tzor*', called Aruan unik (Ervanduni), in Vaspurakan, is further confirmed by the obvious evidence that the Eastern Tigris which falls within this territory was known by the name Arwand (as preserved in theS/ia/mame, vol. I, 70). We can accept, therefore, that even in ancient times, the Uruatri-Musasir highland was within the territory of the Ervanduni family. This is none other than Subartu.

As we have already seen, it was this same mountainous land. Umatri-Musasir. that was called Hurum in the Aratu-Erech epic talc at the beginning of the third millenium B.C. Although there
are certain indications that at the same pe
r
iod of time some Human
elements have infiltrated into the Near East (and hence to Uruat
r
i
Musasir), they did not, however, represent an important power and did not possess the necessary numbers and the vitality to be able to call the country Hurum by their name. In the section "The IndoEuropcans and the Hurrians" I shall explain in detail how the mountainous land of Uruatri was called Uru-atri or Kardu (<Kiardu),40 meaning 'place of fire*
, because of its volcanic nature. The name Hurum, having the same meaning, was merely a geographical
term and had no ethnic value.
It is known thai it was in the second quarter of the second millenium B.C. when the Hurrians have crossed the Zagros range in massive waves of migration, entered the regions called Assyria,
from there spread over Northern Mesopotamia and Northern Sy
r
ia and penetrated into the Armenian Highland" and Cilicia. This was the time when the Hurrians constituted a great percentage of the population in Uruatri-Musasir. It is very likely, therefore, that the Hurrians have received their name from the name of the country, Hurum, (and not vice versa), when ihey became an important element in her population. From then on they have spread that name in the Near East in the times of Mitanni.
1 find that the Ur-banda (Ervanduni) family has been one of the most important of the Nairian-Subarian tribes who, being in constant conflict with Assyria, had formed the tribal union of Uruatri which, under continuous Assyrian pressure, was forced lo move its
administrative center to the north, near Lake Van, and constituted
the nucleus of the future powerful Urartian kingdom. Movses Khorenatsi. drawing his data from the Syrian chronicler
Mar-Aba Kalina. has preserved this information of traditional and historiographic value, that Hayk, when moving from the land of Ararad (Uruatri) to the Lake Van region and Hark', has bequeathed
40. The lerm Kardu I <Ki-ardu. 'place of fire') will be dealt with in detail in Chapter 5. Section 2. The Sumehan name Ur-baoda of the Ervandunis and the name Ki-ardu (Kardu) given to the land of Ararad<Uruai
r
i must be considered as evidence that the Sumerian language was used in these regions in their lime. Thus, the Sumcro-Armenian linguistic and cultural connections and parallels pointed out become more comprehensible. 41. This, too. will be discussed in detail in Chapter 3, Section 2.



116 ARMENIA, SUBART U AND SUMER
his house (in Ararad) to Aramaneak's son Kadmos (< Kadmubi). This very ancient piece of information shows, likewise, that Katmu i, as well as the land of Ararad, both part of Armani-Subartu (see Map I), were the possession of Hayk's posterity (Aramaneak's son) or the heritage of the Armenian people even before the founding of
Urartu
A further proof for this is provided by the fact that the second Khabur begins in this area, and, as we have seen, this name is preserved in the Armenian language with the meaning of 'source' (m}upnLp>uiqp}iLp) *
As mentioned earlier, the names Uru-atri or Ur-artu and Ki-ardu
or Kardu (>Korduk*
, MnpipiLf) were geographical terms and did not have any ethnic value; nevertheless, in later limes they have acquired a signi
f
icance as such for their inhabitants. The ArmcnoHu r nan (Nairian) people of the southern region of the Armenian Highland have developed divergent tendencies because of their forbidding mountains- Xenophon calls these people Karduh who, retreated to the heights of their mountains, would not submit lo the Achacmenians, in whose days the Eastern Tigris (i<Ccm
r
ilcs,,) had
become the border of the Armenia satrapy. But du
r
ing the Artashessian rule they were united again with Armenia. In spite of all these, this southern part of the Nairian land has been the region the most subjected to foreign influences. In the days of Assyria, under bloody supressions, certain groups of these people have moved away, not only northward (toward Hark*), but also east
ward (toward Atropatia).42 Du
r
ing the Sassanid rule (224-642 A.D.) an important portion of the Armeno-Nairian population of KarduKorduk' was forced to adopt the Iranian Zoroastrian religion and the Kirmanji language through the Iranian military and the Median nomadic tribes of the Matiene region who were brought and settled in the country; then under Arab domination they accepted the Islam. During the Seljuk-Ottoman rule a large number of Armenians of this region who still had remained Christian, in order to escape bloody persecutions, were converted to Islam and joined these (mostly Armenoid) people who were already called Kordu>Kurd and who enjoyed great privileges and liberties because of their Islamic religion.
42. It is probable thai these Nai
r
ian people of Alropatia (Azerbaijan) and Pcrsis may have been those whom Polybius (200-120 B.C.) and later Strabo call Kurtioi or Orfw; H is not unlikely either thai the latter may have been the inhabitants of the land of Cirdu-ni mentioned by Argilti II.

. THE PROTO-HOMELAND
OF THE CELTIC RACES
AND CELTO-CAUCASIAN CONTACTS
So far we have spoken mostly about the lands of the southern regions of the Armenian Highland and their inhabitants who, by virtue of their contacts with the ancient peoples of Mesopotamia, were more widely known in historiography. Yet. there was very little known about the aborigines of the central and northern sections of the Armenian Highland. In addition, placing the Indo-European hemoland in Europe - an idea that dominated the scientific thinking for a long lime had created a deadlock in a number of important problems related to linguistics and historiography. For example, the known fact that in the Indo-European family of languages the Armenian stood linguistically closer to the Greek branch on the one hand and to the
Iranian on the other, was a geographically inexplicable phenomenon. From where did the Hittiies come to Central Anatolia and from where did the Indo-lranians move to the Iranian Plateau and to India,
were puzzling questions. Also it was impossible to explain geographically all the phenomena that point to the ancient kinship of IndoEuropean and Semitic parent languages, or the traces of mutual influence observed between the Indo-European languages of Europe
and the Caucasian and Semitic languages. All these problems are immediately clarified, however, when we definitely accept the fact (hat the Indo-European proto-homcland was located in the Armenian Highland and the neighboring regions of Asia Minor, as it was suggested by us in our studies published as early as in 1970 and 1973. The two-volume work entitled The Indo-European Language and the Indo-Europeans, authored by
two Soviet academicians, T.V. Gamkrelidze and V.V. Ivanov, has
been of great significance for this viewpoint. By means of linguistic research, the authors have come to the same conclusion, namely, that the Indo-European homeland was located around the area of the juncture of present-day Iraq, Syria and Turkey, incuding Lake Van. They have rightly shown that in the old the Indo-European language had been in contact with the Semitic languages on the
one hand and with the Caucasian on the other. However, they have indulged in subjective excess by geographically lowering the area



118 ARMENIA, SUBARTU AND SUMER
of contact between Indo-Europeans and Caucasians from the Caucasian regions considerably to the south, thus contradicting certain
obvious and documented data.
There are definite historiographic, archaeological and linguistic evidences showing that in antiquity there were Indo-Europeans in the regions of Lake Cildir and Lake Sevan and that the boundaries of their habitations extended to the Kura river and the Caspian sea. It was in this very same area of the Kura river where the contacts between the Indo-European and Caucasian languages have
taken place. As an argument in favor of the Indo-European-Caucasian contacts, Gamkrelidze and Ivanov mention certain linguistic elements borrowed by the Caucasians from the Indo-Europeans, among
which there are also the Caucasian forms of the Armenian word
gini (4wine'), It is on this very word gini that I would like to make
a few observations.43.
It is accepted in linguistics that the native Armenian word gini comes from the Proto-Indo-European root voinio/voino* According to Adjarian, its dcsccndcnls arc:
:
wilh initial v
Latin - vlnum
Italian - vino
Spanish - vino
Romanian - vinU French - fin German - wan
English - tvrne
Albanian - vine Old Slavic - vino Russian - vino
Cymric - gwin Armenian - gini } with initial g
Hitlite - gen[SJ | with initu
As we can see, the majority of Indo-European languages have preserved the initial v of the parent language, whereas the Cymric of the Celtic languages (the Welsh tongue in Wales. England), the
Armenian and the Hittite have changed the initial v to g.
43. The noted linguist John A.C. Greppin also ha& made reference 10 this word im i tjfiCJi) in his Book Review on Gamkrelidze and Ivanov's work. See BR.



THE PEOPLES OF THE ARMENIAN HIGHLAND IN ANTIQUITY 119
According to Gamkrelidze and Ivanov, the following words. all meaning wine, are among those that the Caucasians have borrowed from the Indo-European:
Georgian - gvino Svanelian - gwind Laz - g[w]in
Here we see clearly that these Indo-European loan words in the Caucasian language, loo, have the initial g instead of the original v of the parent Indo-European tongue. Since in the IndoEuropean family the initial g appears only in Hittite (gen[SJ), in Armenian (gini) and in Cymric (giwjin), it must be concluded that the Caucasians must have made their borrowings from the IndoEuropean, either through the Hittite, or the Armenian, or the Cymric (Celtic) languages; furthermore, it is more probable that the borrowing is made through the latter, because the Caucasian forms have not only g as the initial sound, but gw, just as the Cymric has. We know that as a rule, the initial v of the Indo-European changes to g in Armenian, and it is not incidental that of (he Celtic languages the Cymric also has gw in place of v. The same phenomenon is observed also in Cornish and Breton which, like the Cymric, belong to the same Brythonic group of the Celtic branch. As an
illustration, I would like to bring from Adja
r
ian only three other examples, because of space limitation. The Proto-Indo-European root of the native Armenian word geitz ( qi-q.'i, 'intense desire') is vel, some of whose descendents are:

THE PEOPLES OF THE ARMENIAN HIGHLAND IN ANTIQUITY 121
From these obvious evidences ii is clearly seen that the ancestors of those who spoke the Cymric (Welsh), the Cornish and the Breton sub-branches of Celtic, have been rather close to Armenians in their
original Indo-European homeland and have lived approximately under the conditions (or in the vicinity) of that particular linguisticogeographical environment where the Indo-European initial v has
been changing to g.
Considering also the exact correspondence beiween the initial gw in the said Caucasian forms borrowed from the Indo-European. and the same initial gw of the mentioned Celtic words (much more so than the g of the Armenian and the Hittite), we arc led to accept that the original homeland of the Celtic races was located at a place much closer to the Caucasians, that is, in the area lying between the Armenians (Shirak and the Araratian plain) and the Caucasians (Middle Kura). Thus we arrive at the conclusion that the original homeland of the Celtic races must have been located in the northeastern parts of the Indo-European homeland, in the regions of the upper basin of the Kura river and the (pildir and Sevan lakes. (And, of course, one should not be surprised if certain Ibcro-Caucasian loan elements are found in Celtic languages.)
Rusa I (735-713 B.C.) of Urartu has left an inscription on a cliff near the village of Dzovinar, near Lake Sevan, where he mentions
the names of 23 countries around Lake Sevan which he has con
quered in the course of one year. Among these he singles out the following four, as being defeated in one raid: Adatfuni. Uelikuhi. Luerubie, and Arquqini.** On the other hand. Sarduri 11 (764-735
B
.C.). in the great inscription he has left on the cliff of Van, gives the land-name Uelikutji in the form Uelikuni.** The names of these four countries given by Rusa I have been preserved in the same geographical order and have reached us as the following known names: Adahuni (=Ansakh), Uelikuni (=GeUk*uni), Luerufyi (=Lori), and Arquqini (=Gugarene, as it was called by the Greeks, = Gugark'
in Armenian).
ArgiSti I (786-764 B.C.) also had recorded on the stele, found at the St. Sahak Church in Van, the following names among the countries he had conquered: LuSa, Katarza, Eriatji, and Gu/ufafc/.46 We know from Adontz's work that Katarza is Kghardj (Unumo)
44. UKN. 329. 43. Ibid. 286,



122 ARMENIA, SUBARTU AND SUMHR
and Eriatji is Shirak (in the upper basin of the Eraskh river). As for Oulutalji, to determine its location, I have taken as a premise the sequence of these place-names in the order they are recorded in Argi$li's inscription* whereby Enahi must have been located
geographically between Katarza and Guluta
f
yL Since Kghardj (Kaiarza) is in the west of Shirak (Eria
f
yi), hence Guluta
f
ti must have been located in its east, along the Kghardj-Shirak line, which leads us
to the western flanks of the Getam mountains, the eastern flanks
of which comprise the land of Udikuni-Gelak'uni, stretching along the southwestern shores of Lake Sevan. According to this reckoning, Guluta i must be placed along the western flanks of the Gelam range, bending north toward the Dzaghkuniats mountains. I find
that the village lying between Garni and Gclard, with its presentday name Gok* ( nqp ) and its ancient name Golot* ( ntjnp
Gulut), genuinely preserves the memory of the name and the country of Guluta(l}i)/\
This shows that the two land-names Uelikuni (Welikuni> Getak'uni) and Gulurabi, situated each on the two opposite sides of the Gelam mountain range and its summit known as Mount Gel (tbtj,
Gel), must have belonged to the two segments of the same race Wd (>Ge/>Ge/) or Cul (Gol)> separated by the mountain range,
Linguistically, the borrowings effected by the Caucasians from the Celts had lead us to the conclusion that the original homeland of the Celtic races must have been situated geographically in (he vicinity of the Caucasians and, hence, located in the regions of
the sources of the Kura river and Lake Sevan. We see that the
lands of Uelikuni and Gulutahi of the Wei ( hbq, Gel) or Gul f n/, Goi> race were located right at these very same regions.
Therefore, I consider it more than probable that this Uelikuni-Gu
lula
f
yi highland (comprising the Get (Gelam) mountains), called KeXroi by the Greeks and Celtae by the Romans, is none other than the original homeland of the Gd/Gaul/Galli race. In fact, the people of the Celtic land of Guluta(tji) who established settlements in the basin of the wide western curve of the Halys river (in the region of present-day Ankara) were later (3rd century B.C.) called Galatae and their region Galalia by the Romans ('hiuijuxuifiui,

Calatia, in Armenia). It must be clear that ihe race- or land-name Udikuhi/Uelikuni (and of course the name Gulutahi also) is basically Indo-European, the evidence being that in the Armenian language the initial sound v (or w) of only Indo-European words has been changed to g (as it is in Euelikuni>Getaktuni, bqiufniQli). For the importance they bear to Ihe study of our topic, I have located the land-names Uelikuni and Gulutahi in Map 4.

Celtic environment, the process of transition of the initial v to g was underway and it was taking place neither simultaneously nor a( the same rate in all regions; while Uclikuni was still keeping the initial u (=h' or v), on the other side of the mountains Culutafti had already changed the v to £. If these explanations of mine are correct, then we must admit that the two segments of the same great race separated by the Gel (Getam) mountains were already in the process of developing dialectal differences, similar to the situation of another case, namely» that while a Grabar-typc speech of old Armenian was maintained at Khotrdjur (tunmp nLp)} in Karin ('impliQ -Erzurum)t on the opposite side of the mountain a dialect of the ka (Itft) branch had started to develop. For a large
people it is not unusual for its different segments to be designated by names that are derivatives or phonetic variants of the same basic
name of that race.
It must be pointed out that, in general, place-names preserve their forms and resist change much longer that the words of the language of a given country. This explains why the name of the land Uclikuni had still preserved the v (u) in the days of Sarduri II (8(h centure B.COi while in the language of Uelikuni-Gulutahi the process of the v>g transition had already started, effecting the change of the initial v (o gw. This process was accelerated only when they became part of the Armenian people by the efforts of ArgUli I, Sarduri II and Rusa I, with the result that eventually, a certain
lime after Rusa 1, the name Uclikuni ceded to the form Gdak'uni.
I think that the initial gw in the above-mentioned branches of Celtic languages represents the intermediate phase of the v>g transition of the Indo-European initial sound. The same can be said for the initial gw in the various forms of the word for wine which the Caucasians have borrowed (Georgian gvinop Swanelian gwinel, Laz g[wjin). This suggests that the Caucasians have made their borrowings not directly from the parent Indo-European language, but, after its breakup, from the developed dialectal form of one of its branches, namely, the Celtic, which seems to have been influenced by her neighboring or coexisting relative, the Proto*Armenian* On the other hand, in the south, the Proto-Scmitic language must have borrowed the word wainu lwine' (Arabic jij , wein, Hebrew yayin, Ethiopian wein, etc., with its initial w) from the parent Indo-European language in earlier times and not from Armenian at a later date, when in the latter the initial v was already changed
to g.



THE PEOPLES OF THE ARMENIAN HIGHLAND tN ANTlQUrTY 125
This phenomenon shows thai the Caucasians have come from the north to south, to the upper basin of the Kura river, at much
later limes. In fact, the name Kura is not Caucasian, but has ori
ginated from the place-name Quria(ni),4* mentioned in Sarduri H's inscription on the cliff of Van, which is the name of the land located around the sources of (he Kura river, north of Lake < Udir, and belonging to one of the Indo-European (possibly Cimmerian) races thai has entered into the formation of the Armenian people (see Map 4). Of course it is not exactly known when ihe Caucasians have come to the Kura basin, but we can conjecture iha( their approach (o this northeastern border of the Indo-European homeland must
have taken place at a lime thai corresponds to the intcrmcdiaie (gw-) phase of the v>g transiiion in ihe language of the Celts. It musl be that during this very same intermediate phase certain groups of Celtic races have migrated westward from their original homeland, most probably in the lasl quarter of the second millenium B.C., since ihey have preserved ihe initial gw- sound unchanged, wiihoui having completed ihe process of the v>g transiiion, because of their having been separated and away from thai particular environment, thai is. their original homeland, that favored thai transition. As for the basic pan of the Celtic races, they have remained in their original homeland, and having been already integrated with the Armenian people in the days of Urartu, ihey have continued the process of the v>g transition; thus Uelikuni has given rise to Gelak'uni. This latter form has been preserved and has reached us in the oldest (Sth century A.D.) Armenian literature of Mcsropian script. The name Cdak'uni in Khorcnatsi includes noi only the land of Uelikuni, but also the mountain range (Mount Get) bciween Uelikuni and Guluialji and even Lake Sevan. The fifih century
writer Khorenatsi has retained the name Gelam as the name of the
ancestor of this great tribe and, certainly, as the eponym of that
tribe and their land. He writes: "And Celam builds habitations at the seashore and calls the mountain Gel after his own name and
the habitation Gelak'uni, by which name is also called the sea."*9
The root of Gelam is Gel which is the root-name of the tribe and its
land, and -am is the characteristic suffix used for names and cponyms, which we have already spoken about in Chapter I, Section 4, In connection with the name Aram. (Cf. Argam. Bagam. ArSam. and also

Ihe names mentioned in the Ur IIJ inscriptions, such as Hupitam.Se Iam, Pujam, etc.) It is clear, therefore, that both the tribe and their land (Uelikuni-Gelak*uni and Gulutahi) and also both the mountain range and the lake (Sevan) were called Get. Indeed, Khorenalsi bears direct testimony that the mountain was
called Ce/,
Certain authors arc of the opinion that the names Wales and Welsh (formerly Welch), designating respectively the land and the language of this particular people, have originated from the AngloSaxon form welisc meaning 'strange' {wealas, .stranger'). This implies that the invading Anglo-Saxons have called strangers the very same Celtic people who have been living in that land (Wales) before their arrival, while they themselves were the strangers for the local inhabitants. It is not improbable, therefore, that this
particular interpretation may have been based on incidental phonetic similarity of words. It is not unlikely, however, that the previous name Welch of that race may have entered the Anglo-Saxon language with the meaning of 'stranger'
, just as it has occurred in many other instances where certain tribal names have acquired a particular meaning among other peoples. For example, because of the bloody agressions the Urariian kings have carried out from TeiSebaini to Mana and Barsua, this city- or divine name has become equivalent in meaning to cnemy' for the peoples of those regions (e.g. Kirghiz tuspan and Pahlavi duSman mean 'enemy*) and has passed later on into Armenian as t'Snami, 'enemy'. The tribal name Karghoz or Khzrkhzz has acquired among the Turks (in Turkish) the meaning of 'thief. Also the name of the African Negro race has become
simply to mean 'dark-skinned', and the tribal name Subari has
passed on to Arabic and Persian in the form 5uwarj, j' meaning 'horsemen, cavalry*. There are many more such cases. . It is not improbable, therefore, that the Celtic tribal name Welch (wel>gel, qbq) may have preserved the name welik(uni) of their
race and homeland.
It is evident that in the past, those great peoples who were called by one general name, consisted of tribal unions or groupings of tribes that belonged entirely or mostly to the same ethnic clement, Naturally, it must have been (he same for the Celtic people who moved to Europe and formed many races bearing different names,
but all were known as Keltoi to the Greeks and as Calatae or Galli to
the Romans. In fact, there have been many Celtic races in Great



THE PEOPLES OF THE ARMENIAN HIGHLAND IN ANTIQUITY 127
Britain and Ireland most of which are later mentioned in the oldest
inscriptions of the historical period. It is difficult, however, to say which of these names have come from (he original homeland and have been preserved traditionally, and which ones are later appellations. Nevertheless the following names have attracted my attention:
Aquitani
Arverni Catuvellauni German! iceni Feni Pretani
Sequani
Is it just coincidental that all these names50 have the endings -am, -uni and -ni, reminding us of the many place- and tribal names of the Armenian Highland of similar endings, such as Uelikuni? I am tempted to accept that at least a few of these names (probably there are many more like them), and some of those that do not have the -ni ending, come from the Celtic proto-homeland. It is evident that these are names of Indo-European races and not Hurrian. Even if some of their endings bear the later Greco-Roman influence (although the Greco-Roman form of ending is -ne rather than -ni; cf.
A/zinini>Lal. Arzanene, $upani>Lal. Sophene, etc.), it stilt reinforces my assertion made earlier in this book in connection with the name Armani that the -ni ending is not proper to the Hurrian language alone, but it exists also in Indo-European Armenian. It is in order here to say a few words about the Celts of Ireland who were called Eriu in the past {fiire at the present) and /ern by the Greeks. T.G.E. Powell slates that these various forms have ori
ginated from a much older name.51 In any case, the name Eriu (lernO which is the national name of the Celtic Irish, reminds us of the land-name Eriaini which, along with Uelikuni, is mentioned
among the place- and tribal names in Rusa I's inscription found at the village of Dzovinar at the shores of Lake Sevan. According to Rusa's explanations, Eriaini was located in the region near Ihe eastern shore of the lake. And this is where I have placed it on

the map. (II seems that most of these 23 countries mentioned by
Rusa, some of which must have been located in the no
r
th of Lake Sevan, have likewise been Celtic.) In my previous work I have already spoken about the ArmenoIrish connections. Here it would suffice lo quote just the following
statement by Prof. D.M. Lang: "Parallels between Armenian and
Celtic sculpture and interlaced work have been drawn by several scholars.... it seems more likely that the similarities remarked on arise
from a common fund of a
r
tistic taste rooted in the people, It is interesting to note that the Welsh (or Welch) people, that is, those who speak this Celtic language, call themselves Cymry, just as the Armens call themselves Hay. The accepted opinion is that the term Cymry means (or has acquired the meaning of) 'compatriot'
. If this word represents the name of a race, a name that was traditionally preserved and eventually put on record - something which is more than probable - then short of being scandalous, I am tempted to see in it the Cimmerians. This assumption becomes meaningful right away the moment we cast an eye on the map where the Cimmerians' land is adjacent to the proto-homeland Uelikuni-Gulutalji of the Celts or constitutes its northward extension. It is not a mere coincidence that the present-day city of Leninakan. situated right in the Celtic and Cimmerian bell, was formerly called Cumayri/Cumri which reminds us of the term Cymry and also the tribal name Gamirra/Gimirra, known to the Assyrians. It is not a coincidence either that later on in Central Asia Minor
the Celtic Galaiia is again found to be adjacent to ihe Cimmerians {Gamirk in Armenian) of Cappadocia. These data suggest the probability that the Cimmerians were among ihe Celtic races that migrated or invaded to Europe from the Armenian Highland (the IndoEuropean proto-homeland); it is not even unlikely that the Cimmerians might have been Celtic. The Indo-European language of the Cimmerians is still unknown lo scholarship; no written document in their language has been revealed as yei. Some of the old writings that have reached us and were known as Celtic are perhaps Cimmerian. The viewpoint that the Cimmerians are of the same race as the Scythians is quite
extensive in historiography. This asse
r
tion is made of course not from a linguistic point of view but from that of geographico-political connections. It was justified by Ihe view thai within the Indo

European family, these races lived near each other, had closer contacts and may have even developed kinship ties. It was justified also in terms of the older historiographic concept where it was ignored that the Indo-European homeland was in the Armenian Highland, nor was it known that the original homeland of the Celtic races was adjacent to the land of the Cimmerians. On the other hand, both the Cimmerians and the Scythians were brought down from the north. The fact is. however, that the Cimmerians did not come from the Azov region to the upper basin of the Kura river; on the contrary, they migrated from here (their original homeland) northward and, as they multiplied, they spread over the northern regions of the Black Sea. The same can be said for the Scythians. The penetration of the Cimmerians to the Azov region musl have taken place long before their march to Asia Minor. The same must
be said for the Celts who musl have moved weslward more than once at different limes. The first movement seems lo have been with the
Cimmerians (probably the latter leading the way) toward the steppes in the north of the Black Sea, approximately in the last quarter of the second milienium B.C. (It is not unlikely that their first meeting and contact with the Caucasians has taken place at their crossing the Caucasus, before Caucasians' approach to the basin of the Kura river.) They must have passed from here to the Danube basin and advanced up along the river to the temperate zones of Central and Western Europe.
Later, it was again the Celts who. in the 8lh century B.C.. probably in a second great wave of migration, came as horsemen from the wide expanses in the north of the Black Sea. and with their strong iron armaments conquered the entire Central and Western Europe.53 These were the carriers or the originators of the Hallstatt culture in Europe (named after an old settlement in Austria). I wish to emphasize here the fact that the sites represent
ing later and more developed samples of the Hallstatt culture are found in the west of those of the oldest and archaic samples.54 providing thus a tangible proof that the movement of the carriers of this culture has progressed from east lo west.
53. If ch« name /6er/a given to the Pyrcnean Peninsula has any connection with ihe name of the Caucasian Iberians, (hen one may accept the probability that among (he Celto-Cimmerlan races who Invaded Europe via the northern regions of the Black Sea. there may have been a group of Caucasian Iberians.

I must say here parenthetically, that much before the Celts, during the Bronze Age in Europe (near the end of (he third millenium B.C.). the front-runners of the Indo-European-speaking races of Europe, those who carried the battle-axe and inlroduced the bronze to Europe, have passed through Asia Minor to the Balkans and Europe.15 We know that (he oldest traces of metal-working are

zadian writes: "The earliest evidences of metal-working are revealed in the Armenian Highland in as early as the fourth millenium."5* Earlier in this book, in connection with Araffa, I have already spoken about Medzsmor, the famous meial-working center, that made its beginning in the middle of the fourth millenium B.C. In Europe, the distinctive characteristic of the Halhtait culture
of the Celts was the use of iron whose industrial homeland was the
Armenian Plateau. The various artifacts unearthed from sepulchral mounds in Europe, such as iron armaments and other objects, horse gear, personal bronze ornaments, four-wheeled wagons used to bear the deceased at great burials, belong to this culture. All these are specific to the Armenian Highland too. Even viniculture* a characteristic occupation among the Cells, is distinctive of the Armenian Highland, evidenced by the huge jugs like the ones dis
covered at TciSebaini.

Sevan in their original homeland, and also as
r
iders, have crossed the Caucasus and passing through the northern steppes of the Black Sea. have arrived at the Danube basin and Central Europe. The sepulchral mounds where four-wheeled burial wagons, horse gear and personal bronze ornaments were found, must have been the lombs
of their chieftains and leaders. And, as I have said above in connec
tion with the name Cymry, 1 do not consider it unlikely that among them, particularly among their aristocracy and leaders, there may
have also been Cimmerians. T
.G.E. Powell, a specialist on the history of the Cells, writes: "The bronze horse-gear of Caucasian connections, already mentioned as appearing at the end of the Urnficld Bronze Age. may well
have had to do with Cimme
r
ian riders.'*57 The same opinion is expressed by Nora Chadwick, an expert on Celtic studies: "This horse-gear may be identified in the steppes of southern Russia particularly in a culture which may convincingly be identified with that of the Cimmerians who, at a slightly earlier date, appear to have been pushed westwards by the Scythians. Further support for a derivation from southern Russia is provided by the adoption by early Hallstatt chieftains of wagon bu
r
ial, a practice whose origins may be traced in the steppes during the second millenium B.C. It seems probable that some aristocratic refugees came, either to dominate, or more probably to become absorbed in, certain groups of late Urnfield peoples in Central Europe."58 It is very interesting and significant to note also thai for the Celtic people lakes were considered sacred and they used to offer them (by throwing in them, according to Strabo) gold and silver during worshiping rituals.59 This practice seems to have traditionally preserved in it the memory of their native lake Gei (Getam). The Celts used to picture their most important divinity (which was identified with Zeus in Roman times) as a lofty oak tree. We already know thai the cult of the poplar tree was so widespread in the Armenian Highland that it had persisted even after Christianity until the l century. The last westward push of certain Celtic groups from their original homeland Gulutafii (this lime through Asia Minor) must have occured again with the Cimmerians after the days of Rusa I of

Urartu. We already know from Assyrian inscriptions that the Cimmerians had become very powerful in the second half of the 8lh century B.C. They defeated Rusa I in 715 B.C. and thereupon they began to move towards Anatolia along the Djorokh-Kelkit-Halys (Kizil Irmak) rivers. Together with them must have moved certain Celtic tribes of Gulutahi, some of whom having passed to Europe, have probably become the originators of the La Tene culture. Most of the participants of this Cimmerian-Celtic invasion have, after a certain time, served as mercenaries the forces that gained power in Anatolia, and their survivors, as is evident, have
settled in Gamirk in Cappadocia (the Cimme
r
ians) and the Celts of Guluta()))i in Galatia, adjacent to Cappadocia.

. SUBARIAN GODS
I
. Gelb finds the following Subarian divinity names in the Akkadian syllabaries: TeSSup, SauSka, ASlupinu, Zizanu, Lahuratil,
Parsi, and Naiiarsi.1 Although TeSSup (pronounced also TeSSop) and SauSka are also considered as Hurrian gods, they are attributed in the Akkadian syllabaries particularly to the Subarians. This may suggest the idea that perhaps the Hurrians had inherited them from the Subarians. The Subarian god AStu-pinu (AStupinu) has a particular interest for us. The AStu component of this name is also found in UnagAStuaS,2 a divine name of Hayasa, in which the AStuaS form fully corresponds to the Armenian deity Astu-as ('God').1 This deity. about which we shall speak more along with other Armenian deities, is very characteristic in terms of the Subarian-Hayasa-Armenian
connections.
It is difficult to say anything certain about the god Zizanu. Perhaps the Armenian word dziadzan ('rainbow') still keeps his
memory.
The name of the Subarian god la uralil is also interesting. Some consider him also an Elamile god. If true, then the Elamites
must have received him from the Suba
r
ians. I think he was a god of vegetation. Cf. Hillite G,ila)3tjura- ('sunny plant*). Arm. lahur, liujump, 'parsley'

which, in my opinion, might have been linked with the name of this god, Lahuratil. As lo the names Pars/ and Nauarsi (or Nawarsi), Gelb writes that "nothing is known of the last two deities."6 However, if we could read or consider the -si ending in the names Parsi (Uranian Barsia) and Naiiarsi as -ti (or -di), which, in fact, is not unlikely, we obtain Barf/ or Bardi and Nauardi or Nuard, respectively, which are wellknown Armenian deities. We have already spoken about Nuard and we shall do so more later along with Armenian deities. Suffice it to remind the reader at this point that Nuard was the wife of Ara, the sun-god, and she was also called Inanna-Anahit. What concerns the name Bardi (in Armenian this is the name given to the poplar tree, populus pyramidalis), it occupied a very important place in pagan worship among the Armenians, lis tradition was so deeply rooted that it continued to be worshiped in certain regions until the H century A.D. to the extent of raising the opposition of
the Armenian catholicos Nerses Shenorhali. It must also be said that the name Ha/di had a variant, Bardi. which we find in his wife's name.

. THE MAIN DEITIES OF THE HURRIANS
I
. Diakonoff. based on MX. Khatchikian's investigations, sees dialectal differences in the Hurrian inscriptions found at various centers in the Near East, such as, Urartu, Urkish. Mari. Asia Minor, t Mitanni, Ugarit, and others, and gives the names of the more venerated deities in each region. He finds that among all these gods the
following are common to all: TeSSob (Urartian TeiSeba), his wife
t
feba
(Uranian tfuba) and their son Tilla (Urartian Turd).7
The question that arises is this: are these deities Human by origin and have they been brought by them, or have the Hurrians adopted them in the land of Subari after coming to the Near East?

Lei us investigate first the case of the goddess Hcba. I would like (o note first that Heba, which is pronounced as Hebatu or Habatu by the Semites, could have changed among ihem in later times to Hawwatu* Hebrew HawwS (from which is derived the Armenian Yeva, 'Eve')-8 But this aspect belongs to a much later period and has no bearing on the origin of #cbaP even though some assume incorrectly thai tfawa precedes tiaba(lu)We know that goddess Heba's or Huba's sacred animal (lotem)
was the cow, and I find (hat the Armenian word kov (tini|, .cow') is connected wiih the name IJuba). As it is known, in Uranian and olher ancient languages the b between two vowels often corresponds to v in Armenian (cf. Urartian Erebuni * Armenian Erevan, ebani
avanf 4village,* etc,)* and also and k (or g) are conjugates (in human speech the sounds of h, k and g are exchanged easily).9 Compare
Sumerian ha= TT< =Jciia ('fish')*10 Also the name Hatli or tfcta is
rendered Kef-aisik (fijui-uigfif) in the Armenian Bible by the 5th century translators. The Urartian ending -afti corresponds to the Armenian derivative -ak (-mlj); etc. I find, therefore, that the words kov and Huba are related in their origin, In linguistincs it is accepted that the Armenian kov ('cow') is a genuine Indo-European word, its Indo-European root being ov,u It follows, then, that this word, to which the name tfuba corresponds as representing and signifying cow, existed in the Proto-Indo-European language before the third millenium B.C., that is, before the arrival of the Hurrians. Furthermore, one must keep in mind that those deities which have their representation in the animal world come from the ancient totemic period when their corresponding animals were objects of worship. The word kov, with its Indo-European root g*ovt could have been derived, along with its Afro-Asian parallels, from a much older source in (he remote past, but during the period in question (i.e. when the Hurrians appeared in the Near East) this word already existed in the Indo-European language and, furthermore, it docs not have cognate forms in neither the Human nor the Semitic languages. What concerns the Sumerian word gud Cbull'), it differs by far both phonetically (the incongruity of its d sound) and in its totemic significance.

The fact lhat yuba, with iis meaning of cow, was in the ProtoIndo-European language since its lotemic days, negates its Hurrian origin (of course, as long as it is assumed that Hurrian is not an IndoEuropean language) and confirms instead its belonging to the IndoEuropean homeland, that is, the Armenian Highland and its neighboring regions in Asia Minor. This assertion is also supported by the fact that in the treaty signed between the Hitlite king Suppiluliuma and the Hurrian-Miiannian king Mattiuaza, fiepct is listed among the gods of Indo-European Hittites and not among the Hurrian gods.12 This same goddess is called pa-ru and Ha-ba-tu13 in one Indo-European-Hittitc inscription, and she is referred to as Hippa and Hipta, even in the Orphic hymns and in the Greek inscriptions of Maecnia. Also in one Nazi inscription there is the personal name Suwar-tfepa, the first component of which, Suwar, as Gelb asserts, "most probably is Indo-European."u We think il quite possible that this word Suwar which is connected to Indo-European could have been a dialectal form ot Subar-Subari, We have already demonstrated earlier that the bir component of the word Subari<Su-bir is Indo-European and il has its parallel form bar
in Sumerian.
Considering that the goddess Huba*s totem was the cow, we noticed thai the name yuba, by its origin, is connected with the IndoEuropean-Armenian word kov (*cow'), and hence, accepted that the name Huba-Heba cannot be Hurrian (of course, I repeal, as long as the Hurrian language is considered non-Indo-European). Likewise, we find that Tilla, the son of the TeSub-Heba spouses, cannot be Hurrian either, since we see a connection between Tilla and
the Armenian word f/a (uiqui(j), *boy, child1). It is currently accepted in linguistics that the Armenian word //a is derived from the Syrian (alyS, tole ('boy, youth*) which Adjarian characterizes as a "native Semitic word,M and for comparison cites other words of
12 HSt 107. M I have shown above thai the Semites adding the suffix -ru to the Nairian word bir (or her), 'house', have coined the word bin CforT) which has returned back inlo Armenian in the form bert ('fort1). Similarly, I think it probable lhat the Armenian word havat Cftitb*) is the reflection of tfeha in its form Habatu, formed by the addition of the Semitic suffix -fu to Heba (or is, perhaps, a Greek feminine wheedling form of Heoz). 14 HSr 107. Gelb already expresses the idea that Hepet was an autochtonous goddess in Mesopotamia and Anatolia, and that the Hurrians must have received her after their arrival in those regions.



MYTHOLOGY 139
Semitic origin, such as, Hebrew tSle ('young lamb*), Aramaic talis ('boy, lamb*), arabic (a/a ('lamb, kid, fawn'), etc.11 We see, there
fore. that Tilla's name is not Hurrian.
In view of what has been said above about tfeba and Tilla, it seems very likely that when the Hurrians came to the Near East and settled in Northern Mcsopotamnia. in the land of Subartu situated between Indo-Europeans in the north and Semites in the south, they must have adopted the Indo-European name tfeba-IJuba ( = kov, 'cow') and the Semitic name Tilla ((alya-tele>tla, 'boy*) from their northern and southern neighbors, respectively. As to TeSSob (TeSub), it is very difficult to make any definite statement about his origin with the data at hand. Is it possible to
consider him Hurrian when the names of his wife and his son are
not? Of course it is not improbable that the Hurrians may have brought him with them to the Near East, but it is more likely that they have adopted him in the land of Subartu. The oldest documentary evidence about TeSSob comes to us from the days of King Su-sin of the Ur III period.16 In a Hurrian inscription found at Bogazkoy there is the expres
sion *'The Subrian Tessob."17 This may mean two things: first, that
there was a Subrian TeSSob. other than the Hurrian, implying that
Subarians are not Hurrians, and. second, that Tessob was Subarian.

. THE PRINCIPAL GODS OF URARTU
I
. Haldi
The Urartian pantheon was headed by fjaldi. TciSeba, and Siwini, who formed the most powerful triad in Urartian mythology. Haldi has never been a Hurrian god - a fact that no historian should forget. In connection with the interpretation of the epic of Hayk and Bel, I have shown above and in my earlier works that tfaldi is Hayk. the national eponymic god of the Armenians. Haldi was a deity of fire and volcano; he symbolized the vol

canic eruptions thai occurred in the Armenian Highland, particularly in the Lake Van region, in the times of Urartu* In later years, as Uranu became more powerful, he may have also acquired, as a mighty fire-god, the characicristics of the ruler of the heavens. yaldi*s symbol, as a god of fire and volcano* was the lion in ihe animal world. In the wall paintings at Erebunt Haldi is personified on a lion. Movses Khorenatsi, quoting from Mar Aba's
ancient book, characterizes Hayk as "the Yapciostcan Hayk UBu*
ufbmnupbmQQ Auijlp,18 i.e. having ihe nature of Yapetos-Hephaeslus), an appellation which, obviously, must have been given to Hayk during the Hellenistic (Artashessian) period of Armenia when it was still remembered that he was the god of fire. This is another indica
lion thai yaldi, like Hayk, was a god of
f
ire.
Haldi's consort was called Warubanc/Uarubani. I think that
the Armenian word parav (ujumuiL, 'old woman*) is linked with the name Warubai-nc) and preserves the memory of this goddess.
Earlier, on various occasions, 1 have shown that the name
t
faldi must have had a variant in the form bardi. The {fa/ ( ) component of
t
fa/-di has the synonym bar in Sumerian,20 which
means .
f
ire, to bum'
, vat in Armenian. It is possible,
therefore, lo see the name Haldi in the word bardi/bani in Armen
ian (puipq|ii which is the name given to the poplar tree (populus pyramidalis) and which was an object of worship among Armenians
in ancient times and continued to be venerated as a sacred tree even
centuries after Ch

In ancient limes women were often called by their husbands' names, implying "the wife of so-and-so," an example of which is ihe name of Ara*s wife, Nu-ard, where her husband's

Mordunannt in his time. hid already connected the Armenian word ba/tr to the Bag-banu uted In the Assyrian inscription at Khorsabai. (Sec HABt article cftmn
t

MYTHOLOGY 141
Another indication for the Haldi =Bardi equation is the presence of a poplar tree in Sargon*s sculpture of the facade of the yaldean temple at Musasir-Ardinu The susi temples attributed specifically to Haldi provide further evidence. According to information supplied by Khorenatsi, there were sacred plane trees (ran, uou|i» in Armenian) at Armavir whereby predictions were made or the will of god was revealed by their rustling sounds.22 I find that the word sosj, which represents another kind of poplar tree, retains the name susi given to Haldi's sacred temples, and that these susi temples were holy places, where apparently, by the plane trees (sosi) planted around them, the oracles of Haldi revealed his will, just as "at Dodona, the oracle of Zeus the god made his will known by the rustling of the oaks in the wind.*'23 There is no doubt, then, that the plane trees (sosi) at Armavir-Argistiljinili (i.e. the susi temples with their poplar trees (bardi)) represented Haldi and the predictions made by means of
these trees were his oracles.
In ancient pagan times it was believed that fire was born of plants, since trees or wood produced fire when burning. In the name Bar-di the component bar means in Sumerian Might, burning, fire* (hence the assumed composition of the Sumerian word {ba(r)bar, .sun*) and the suffix -di may have meant 'born of or 'begetter', so that Bar-di (or Hal-di) could mean *born of fire* or *fire begetter', a meaning which may help to interpret the term Bardi as *he who begets fire* and Haldi as *he who begets fire-volcano*. In such an interpretation we still sec in the Hal component of Haldi the name Hay, that is, the fire-god Hayk, The following analysis also leads us to the same conclusion: In Urartian inscriptions the name Haldi is very often recorded as AJdi, without the initial intensifying sound A. On the other hand the term Aid/ is a variant of the name Ardi, evidenced by the fad that Musasir, which was the site of Haldi's main temple ('the house of Haldi\ according lo Sargon), was called Ak/wh instead ofAldi-ni or Haldi-ni. We already know that Ardi is the same as Ara, the god of vegetation (>of fire) and the sun, by whose name arc called the Armcn people and their land and with whom are connected the names Ar>Har (or har in Armenian, from which Haruyk, [uuipnjl!. Tire') and Hark4 (>Hayk?).24
22 Khorenatsi, 1-20. 23 OHR, 98. 24 P. Enscn had suggested in 1898 the idea thai the name Hay could have been



142 ARMENIA, SUBARTU AND SUMER
The Bard/ variant of the name tfaldi, as the tree of life, represents also the deity of fire. As it was said, the poplar tree (bardi) has been an object of worship among Armenians for a long period of lime- Its cult was so deeply rooted thai it persisted in certain regions of Armenia until as late as the 12* century of our era. In Urartian times we find the poplar tree (bardi) depicted on kings' helmets, bronze bells and on sculptures representing devotional
scenes.
As the embodiment of the power of fire and symbolizing the volcanic nature of the land, Haldi represented the most powerful and supreme national war-god of the Urartian pantheon, yaldi's
nature will be elucidated further as we consider the characteristics
of Vahagn, who, too, was god of fire and volcano and was considered, like Hayk-Haldi, the ancestor of the Armenian people.25
IL TeiSeba
TciSvba was a deity of storm and lightning and was considered second in power in the mighty triad of the Urartian pantheon. All we can say now about TeiSeba is that his name is a dialectal variant of the Hurrian-Subarian divine name TeSSob (TeSop) that appears to have existed in the Urartian pantheon as a deity inherited
from Subarian times.
Having in view the invasions that the Urartian kings have undertaken against Persia (Parsua), we consider it probable that the name TeiSeba-ini, as the name of a god or a city-fortress, may have survived in Iran and in the East in the words tuSpan ('enemy' in Kirghiz) and duSman ('enemy' in Pflzard, Persian, Pahlavi, etc.). Later, when in the Armenian pantheon many ancient and native gods had already been replaced and were forced to oblivion by foreign deities, the Pahlavi form returned and became the origin of
derived from the name Hate given to the Hittites (with oy between two vowels, as mayr derived from mater). Lacking historical foundation, it was not accepted- Moreover, Armenians called the Hittites. XWatsiner, according to the translation of the Bible. And the proto-Hittite Hales were already assimilated by the Hittites and had long since disappeared. On the origin of the name Hayk, see the section bearing the same title.

Similarly, it is easy lo understand how in Persia Ahriman has turned into a rival deity embodying the Evil; ii may have been
derived (as I think it does) from the name Ribamun27 of the Sumerian storm-god who has the same nature as TciScba-Adad.
III. Siwini
Siwini was a sun-god, Ihe third in the great triad of the Urartian
pantheon.
It is assumed that Siwini is the same as ihe Human sun-god
Simigc (or Simiga). These are, of course, identical in nature and we can accept that these two similar names may have been related by their origin. The -ni ending of Siwi-ni is not part of the root, it is a suffix,
hence, the basic form of the name is Siwi, where the w sound can
easily be compared or exchanged with b. Compare Kumarbi (in the Ra's-Shamra inscriptions) with Kumarwi (in the Bogazkdy and Mari inscriptions).28 Therefore, it is possible to see the form Sibi in Siwi. In fact, one of Ebla's four main gods was 5jpii (Dagan. Baal, RcScph, SipiS).29 In the Ebla inscriptions we do not
f
ind SamaS; there the sun-god is SipiS.30 On the other hand, in the Ugaril inscriptions, instead of Sip/5 (SibiS). we find SapaS31 (or SabaS), which, probably, is a va
r
iant or an earlier form of the Semitic sun-god SamaS. In the Urartian pantheon already there was a deity called Suba which appears to be a variant of Siwi(ni) or Sibi and belonged to one of the iribes forming part of the Urartian kingdom. It does not seem to be difficult, therefore, to see an etymolo
gical connection between Ihe various forms Siwi(ni)t SibtfS), SBpa(S) and Sania(S), all represenling the sun-godt where ihe -ni and -S endings are merely suffixes. Regarding w, b(p) and m being correlative sounds in these names, compare the name Sa-wuSka, ISTAR-buSga and Sa-muSka given to the same goddess-32

144 ARMENIA. SUBARTU AND SUMER
There is the god Samagan" mentioned in the Ebla inscriptions (2500 B.C.) which, I think, is a variant of Simiga, and 1 see the same connection between Simi-ga. Sama-gan and Sama-S as between SawuSka, SawuSgan* and SauSkaS." I consider it very probable, therefore, thai all these divine names represenling the sun-god, i.e, Siwini* SibiS (SipiS), SapaS, SamaS, Samagan and Simiga, have the same origin. Consequently, I think lhat the names 5/wjni and Simiga are not Hurrian by origin and that they seem to have been in existence in the Near East since much earlier limes. It is likely that the Hurrians have inherited Simiga (Simige) in the land of Subartu. The Armens have identified Siwini also with their national
sun-god Ara. I see an evidence for this in the fact that the city of Van was built in the name of Siwini's wife TuSpuca and was called TuSpa. But according to the Armenian tradition, the building of Van is attributed to Samiram who had a passion for Ara- Therefore, since sun-god Ara temptress Samiram was identified with SiwinPs (also a sun-god) wife TuJpuea, then it would be natural to identify
Siwini with Ara.
These comparisons and analyses of the name Siwini suggest
that the source of all these is, most likely, SibiS (SipiS), froifi which
must have come Siwini and SabaS (SapaS)>SamaS, because the rules of phonetic change in languages show that the b(p) between vowels is changed to w (Sibi[s] >Siwi[nil) rather than the other way around. In all these, one certainly must not overlook the role Subartu (later Urartu) has played in the development and interreactions of the material and spiritual cultures of the Semitic world in the south and the Indo-European world in the north and the west, a role which is not as yet correctly and sufficiently appreciatedAs we see, this sun-god, with the numerous variants of his name, has placed the Armenian Highland in a general spiritual relationship with entire Mesopotamia, having Subartu between these two vast regions. Furthermore, as we shall see below, this same deity, in his Urartian form of Siwini (SibiS), has conquered Asia Minor
and the Greek world

. THE DIFFUSION OF THE ARMENIAN
HIGHLAND CULTURE BEYOND ITS BORDERS
Urartu's cultural influence on neighboring and even distant countries has been considerable, particularly in her days of power. when her culture had attained a signi
f
icantly high level. In the times of ISpuini, Menua, ArgiSti I and even Sarduri II, Urartu had acquired great political and military strength. Under ArgiSti I she was considered the most powerful kingdom in Western Asia, casting shadow over Assy
r
ia. In the days of her power she had undertaken great military expeditions to Mana and Parsua (Persia) in the east, to Assyria and Babylonia in the south and to the regions of Asia
Minor in the west.
The Urartian conquests in the east, in Mana and Parsua. have not been temporary, but rather comparatively stable; generally, it was not the policy of the Urartian kings to massacre the population in these regions and ravage the land, as the Assyrians did; instead, not only have they left, in many instances, the existing forts intact, but they have built new ones and placed garrisons in them. A passage in Menua's inscription (left at Tash-Tcpe) bears testimony to this effect: "With the greatness of tfaldi, Menua, ISpuini's son, built this fort, conquered the city of MeiSta, from there he invaded
the land of Mana ... he left there ... he left foot soldiers ..."
Such conditions would necessarily contribute in a large extent to the spreading of the influence of Urartu's building arts and spiritual culture in Mana and Persia. Our topic suggests, however, to concentrate on the spiritual.
The noted archaeologist G.A. Tiratsian writes: |

to find also elemenis of Uranian-Iranian rapprochement in various compositions and pictorial representations of religious and ritual themes. In the last century, in one of the storage jugs at Toprak Kale, a golden medal was discovered bearing ihe engraved image of two women, one seated on a throne and the other standing before her. ... The accepted interpretation is that the woman on Ihe throne is Ihe Urartian goddess of fertility, Arubani, Haldi's wife, whom the Urartian queen is worshiping. ... It is interesting that this theme in Urartian an is also found depicted with exactly the same characteristics on an Iranian seal of the Achaemenian period; ... here, too, are pictured ihe same seated goddess and a woman standing in front of her.37
It must be mentioned here also that the emblem of "the sun
on the lion's back" which appears on Ihe Iranian flag corresponds to lhe picture of "Haldi on a lion" discovered at Erebuni.38 The civilization of the Armenian Highland has also exerted considerable influence on the Indo-European peoples of Asia Minor in the west, a fact that has been forgotten in the darkness of history, 1 would like to bring forth here some evidences and data that under* line the important role played and the impact created by Urartu's spiritual culture on Ihe process of the formation of Greek mythology.
We have seen earlier that the Sumerian deity (or goddesses) Inanna-Anunit-Nina has also been the Inanna-Anahit-Nane deity (or goddesses) of the Armenian Highland, Anahit, the great national goddess, was regarded as the protector and the mother of the land ever since the matriarchal period and was the object of utmost veneration and respect not only in her own Armenian High* land, but beyond its boundaries. She was known among other IndoEuropean peoples, and her name, whose pronunciation was taboo, had reached Europe in its inverted form, Diana, Similarly, the name of the Urartian storm-god TeiSeba or TeSop has passed on to Greece, likewise inverted, in the form of Poseid(on)$ retaining his characteristics of a storm-god, only attributed to Ihe sea, obviously by virtue of the geographic nature of Greece. The -on ending of the name Poseid(on) is a known Greek suffix (cf. Actaeon, Apollon, Pygmalion, Agamemnon, Alcmaeon,
37 Ibid., 158-159,

etc.). therefore, the basic name is Poseid which, read backwards, gives Dicsop or TeiSop (the Hurrian-Subarian TeSop or the Urartian TeiSeb[a]), which, 1 believe, is the original form of the name. The t in TeiSop is pronounced as d in its inverted form Poseid(on), just as the t in Anahir is changed to d in Its inverted form Diana. The identity of TeiSeba-TeSop with Poseid(on) is proved not only by the agreement of their names (in inverted form) and by their both being gods of storm and thunderbolt, but also by the unmistakable similarity in their pictorial representations: TeiSeba holdins a trident.39 like a candle-stick, symbolizing lightning,

and standing on a bull, the symbol of storm, with his right foot
on the head of the beast, and Poseidon, likewise, holding a trident
and his right foot resting on a figure of similar meaning. These pictures prove that Poseidon is TeSop. There are however, other important and interesting evidences. The Urartian pantheon was headed by the triad of Haldi, TeiSeba, and Siwini, whereas in Greek mythology Hades. Poseidon and Zeus were brothers. Zeus was the god of Heaven, Poseidon of sea storms and Hades of the subterrenean kingdom. I find that just as Poseidon is TeiSeba, the god of storm and thunderbolt, similarly. Hades, the god of the underwold, is Haldi, the god of volcano, and Zeus, the god of heaven, is the sun-god Siwini. It is not difficult to see the identity of the names Zeu(s), Sibi(S) and Siwi(ni). As I have pointed out earlier, the -ni ending in Siwini corresponds, as a suffix, to the S ending of S/pi'f (or more precisely, SibiS). Similarly, the ending of Zeus (Zeu-s)40 corresponds to those of SibiS (Sibi-S) and Siwini (Siui-ni); the b between two vowels is
changed to w (u), thus making Zeus41 (and even the Phrygian Sabazlios] or SavazfiosJ) and Siwini conform with SibiS. It can be accepted, therefore, that the names Sibtf (and Sabag of Ugaril). Zeus (and Sabazlios] or Savazfios]) and Siwini are basically the same divine name and they represent the deity of the sun and.
in certain cases, of the heavens.
We must accept also that Hades, the god of the underworld, is fjaldi, the god of fire and volcano, the name Had-es being a softened version (IJallJd) of Haldi. Obviously, the basic word in

41 Homer is the oldest Greek source lhai mentions Zeus, There are differeni
opinions about his time, varying between the 12ih and the 7th centuries. Some authors attribute the events narrated by him to the Mycenaean peiod (1100 B.C.), but it is more likely that they belong to the Uranian period. It is
known, however, thai much before Homeric times, SibiS was known in
Ebla, SabaS in Ugarii and Tetop among the Mitanmans and the Hittitcs. Therefore, Haldi, TeiSeba and Siwini must have existed in Ibc Armcnain Highland and Asia Minor (i.e- the Indo-European homeland) long before Homeric
times. The fact that the brothers Hades, Poseidon and Zeus are the same as the
Urartian triad Haldi, Tditba and Swim may show that they are of Indo-European origin, adding one more proof to the Indo-European ancestry of the Nairian tribes that formed the Urartian kingdom. We shall discuss this further in the last chapter. (I note also here, parenthetically, the possibility that Siwini may have been the origin of Engl, sun, A.S, sunoc).

In admitting the identity of the names Hades and IJaldi, we have in view not only their phonetic resemblance but also the similarity of their nature: the god of volcano (yaldi) was certainly the god of the underworld (Hades). In addition. HadesPoseidon and Zeus are three brothers. just as #a/(/i, Teiieba and S/wini constitute a triad.
Thus we see that the three brothers, Hades, Poseidon and Zeus, who are the most prominent gods in Greek mythology, are none
other than
t
faldi. TeiScba and Siwini, the principal triad of the Urartian pantheon.
Other than linguistic and mythological compa
r
isons, there are also historical and traditional evidences that support our assertion. Movses Khorenatsi, drawing his information from a Chaldean version (translated to Greek) of Mar Aba's ancient book, relates certain details about Aram that remind us of the following Greek legend:
Cronus. Ihe junior Titan, fearing that his newborn sons may later revolt against him and-usurp his power (just as he had done il to his father Uranus), swallows them. But his wife Rhea hides away her son Zeus and then forces Cronus to disgorge her children. Zeus grows up and with his brothers' help defeats the Titans and Cronus. The latter (according to another tale) moves to an island and rules there.4:
The Armenian patriarch Aram, in Khorenatsi's tale, is Arame, the founder of the Urartian kingdom; therefore, all that is told
there about Aram pertains not only to Arame, but generally to the exploits of the powerful Urartian kings whose victories and mighty deeds are attributed to the Urartian gods in their inscriptions. This is what Khorenatsi writes about Aram, drawing his infor
mation from Mar Aba:
He [Aram] moved west, ... reached the regions of the Cappadocians. ... Here, he confronted in war with the Titanian Payapis Kalea who had occupied by force the area between the two seas, that is, between Pontus and the ocean. (Aram] clashed against him and routed him and made him escape to
an island in the Asian sea.*1

ISO ARMENIA, SUBARTU AND SUMER
As we sec, Aram's victory (i.e. the victory of Urartu's mighty kings, hence, that of her great gods) over the Titanian Payapis-Kaiea in Cappadoda and the laltcr's escape to an island corresponds exactly lo (he legend of the Titan Cronus who went to an island after being defeated by Zeus and his brothers. We could have perhaps argued that Khorenatsi*s source Mar Aba, or a more ancient source of the latter (or even the Armenian tradition formed during the Hellenistic period in Armenia), may have linked the episodes of Greek mythology with AranTs (i.e. Urartu's) invasion to the west; but the fact thai Zeus and his brothers Poseidon and Hades carry the names of the principal Urartian deities supports the hypothesis that the Greek legend is merely an echo of Urartu's conquests in the west that have acquired mythological character. If we assume that the Greek legend is the original source, then we must also assume that its author, who ascribes its episodes to Aram, was fully aware that the heroes of the Greek legend were the
gods of Urartu; otherwise, why would he have att
r
ibuted them to Aram (i-c. to the patriarch of the Armenians or to the founder of the Urartian kingdom)? After I had completed my comparative study about (he Urartian deities tfaldi, TeiSeba and Siwini and the Greek gods Zeus, Poseidon and Hades, I was pleased to find out that J. Markwart, too, in his lime, had noticed the similarity between the story of Aram's exploits against the Titans in the region of the volcanic mountain Argaeus in Cappadocia (Maiak-Caesarea) and the Greek legend that speaks about Zeus and his brothers defeating the Titans. Bui Markwart, being under the influence of the false hypothesis of 4*the migration of the Armens," still prevalent in his days, has attributed the connection between Aram and the Greek legend to the assumption that the Arims (Armens) "were yet in Cappadocia before reaching Urartu," and, supposedly, "the Arims who lived in these regions have linked that legend with the name of their ancestor Arim, considering it the fight of Arim against the Titans or the Giants, Later (supposedly) the name Arim was changed to Aram, perhaps in memory of the above-mentioned Urartian king Arame, or probably under the influence of the name "Aram/*
mentioned in the Bible, the ancestor of the Aramaeans- the in
habitants of Syria and Mesopotamia*****

MYTHOLOGY IS1
It is obvious that Markwart's interpretation of this question is based on the "migration" hypothesis of the Armens that dominated in his days. Of course, he did not know that those heroes
who fought against the Titans had the names of the principal Urartian gods, and, consequently, he could not connect the episodes of the Greek legend with the military conquests of the Urartian kings
in the west.
We know, for example, that the Urartian kings Menua, ArgiSti I and Sarduri II have all undertaken military expeditions towards west and have fought victorious battles against the forces of the countries in those regions. Caesarea was, of course, among conquered regions. It is even very likely that Arame himself may have carried out successful expeditions which may have been forgotten, not having been recorded in his days. Menua has already left an inscription found on a stone at Van, stating that he had invaded against Mana in the east and advanced beyond the city of Kumenu and reached Assyria in the south. His forces had waged victorious battles in the west and had occupied SuriSili-ni, Tarljigama-ni and other cities and had conquests in the lands of Hati-na and A/zi-ni.41 ArgiSti I, too. must have conquered these same regions, since his writings reveal that he had brought 6600 warriors from Hate and $upani and installed them in the Erebuni city-fortress which
he had built.
Markwart. in developing his interpretations of Aram's story (from the "migration** viewpoint, of course), entirely overlooks the valuable information given by Khorenatsi, drawn from an ancient Chaldean. non-Armenian, source, according to which Aram is not the leader of the Armenians in Cappadocia, but he comes from Armenia (Urartu) to invade the west, and that he does this only after defeating the Medes (Niukar Mades) in the east and the Assyr
ians in the south. Here is Khorenatsi's narrative with minor abridgments:
This same Aram, not many years before Ninos ruled Assyria and Nineveh,... came across, near the Armenian borders.
a group of Median youths whose leader was a certain Niukar Mades. ... Aram suddenly attacked him before sunrise and
slaughtered his large multitude and taking Niukar himself, called Mades, prisoner, brought him to Armavir.... This same

Aram, after concluding the battle against the eastern people, moved, with the same forceT towards the regions of Assyria. There, too> he found another spoiler of his country* by the name BarSam* of the race of the giants, with 40000 fully armed foot soldiers and 5000 horsemen; he had oppressed the people with heavy taxes and had turned the entire surrounding land into a desert. Aram waged war against him and pursued him through Korduk to the Assyrian plain, killing many. And BarSam, happening to be found before his armbearers, got killed, We must still tell all the deeds of valor that he did in the west against the Titans, He moved west and acquiring an additional force of 40000 fool soldiers and 2000 horsemen, reached a certain place in the regions of Cappa
docians which is now called Caesarea. Here, he confronted
in war with the Titanian Payapis Kalea who had occupied by force the area between the two seas, that is, between Pontus and the ocean, (Aram) clashed against him and routed him and made him escape to an island in the Asian sea.46
As it is seen clearly, here Aram is not an imaginary or legendary figure* he is the Urartian king Arame who has fought against Assyria, even though he may personify, as the founder of the Urartian kingdom and dynasty and hence the patriarch of the Armenians, the exploits of the mighty Urartian kings in general, It becomes evident now that it is wrong to assume prejudicially, on the basis of the erroneous "migration" hypothesis, that Aram was the name of the leader (or ancestor) of the Arims who lived in Cappadocia, or that it was derived from the name of the "ancestor"
of the Aramaeans mentioned in the Bible,
Furthermore, these events, according to that Chaldean source recorded by Khorenatsi, have taken place, with reliable chronological accuracy, "nor many years before Ninos rules Assyria and Nineveh/* that is, not many years before Nineveh became Assyria's capital. We know that Nineveh became Assyria main capital in the days of Sennacherib (705-681 B,C,), And sure enough, it was certainly not too long before this time when the Urartian kings Arame, Menua (810-786 B,C.), Argigti 1 (786-764 B.C.) and Sarduri
II (764-735 B.C.) lived and carried out their said expeditions to the west, In citing these evidences, our purpose is to show that it is not

MYTHOLOGY 153
by coincidence that in the Greek legend Zeus and his brothers, Hades and Poseidon, who defeated the Titans, bear the names of
the three most powerful Urartian gods, and thai our assertion for the identity of the Greek heroes with the Urartian gods is not based merely on similarities or accordance in names and on Khorenatsi's record, but on real and firm historical ground. Of course, in this question, one must also have in view that the land between Greater Hayk* (Urartu) and Caesarea was inhabited by Armenians. There is much historical data to prove that between the main territory of the Hittite kingdom and Greater Hayk' there were in existence a number of individual Armenian principalities and states, such as, Hayasa, Pa uwa, Suhmu, Tegarama, Isuwa, Alzi, Dzopk', etc., which were also designated as "Higher Hayk'," "Lesser Hayk*," "Second Hayk'," etc., and constituted separate segments in the western regions of the cradle of the Armenian (Nairian) people. In the Armenian Highland, as the Armenian-Nairian household elements (or clans) of the ancient communal society have in general crystallized into different tribes and then unified as a people, these states have constituted distinct localities. Among the 6600 warriors whom ArgiSti I moved to Erebuni. those who were called tfate must have been Armenians from these regions liberated from Hittite rule or who had renounced the Hittite
alliance. It is obvious that those brought from Sopk' were already Armenians. Otherwise, ArgiSti would not have trusted them with the protection of a fortress of such strategic importance as Erebuni was. It is, of course, possible to assume that the Arims of these localities who were eyewitnesses (or participants) to Urartu's exploits and victories against the Titans near Caesarea, have contributed to the creation and propagation of this Greek legend; an assumption, which could support further their kinship with the Urartian kings, the authors of these exploits. It is very interesting for our topic to note the part that Mr. Ar aeuj, the prominent volcanic mountain near Caesarea, has played in the mythological formation of our legend. Academician Manuk Abeghian submits important information about the Titans in this region. He writes:
The chief among the giants is Typhon (Typhos, Typhoeus, who is, indeed, a smoke ejector, a smoker, and, as a common noun, means cyclone, a storm accompanied with lightning and thunder). He is the symbol of volcanic mountains and



154 ARMENIA, SUBARTU AND SUMER
destructive storms: he has one hundred heads and ejects flames from his hundred mouths. Zeus puts him under the volcanic Mt. Etna or, according to others, under the volcanic
island Inarime or Aenaria in the Mediterranean Sea, where
he continues lo eject fire.47
As! have mentioned. Armenians who lived around Ml. Argaeus in Cappadocia and near the Greek regions must have participated not only in ihe propagation of this legend but even in the very events that have given rise to it by cooperating with the Urariians.
We have deflnite testimonies as to the esixience of the Armcns
in that region:
During the time when the Homeric epic was created (10-1century B.C.), one of the proto-Armenian races, the
Armens. was known lo the Greeks in a number of localities, ... in Cilicia, in the valley of the river Calycadnus where were
ihe "mountains of ihe Arims;" near the mouth of the Oron
les river, in the region of Anlioch; and finally, arounl Mt. Argaeus in Cappadocia where, according to the Armenian national tradition, is located the "First Hayk*" ("U.nui?|iG iwjf=',First Armenia"). The legend of the fire-spitting mountain and the monster Typhon is also linked with all these locations. This legend ihat was known near the borders of Mysia and Lydia, in Cilicia. in the region of the mouth of the Orontes river, and around Mt. Argaeus, is connected,
therefore, with the race of the Arims.4*
We know that Hatdi was a god of fire and volcano, TeiSeba a god of storm and thunderbolt, and Siwini was a sun-god, hence
the god of heaven. Consequently, the victory of the Uranian forces over the Hitlites near Caesarea. or over the forces of these regions, could have been interpreted in pagan times as the defeat of Argaeus. the chief of the Titans and the representative of volcanic forces, by the combined powers of the Urartian gods of sun, storm-thunderbolt and fire-volcano of the Armenian Highland. After the defeat (apparently when the volcano became extinct), the Titan

MYTHOLOGY 155
Cronus49 went lo an island in ihc sea and continued to live by means
of another volcano that was active there.
In all these details the important thing for our topic is, that the
greatest gods in Greek mythology, the brothers Hades, Poseidon and Zeus, are, by their names, by their nature and characteristics, identical with the most powerful triad of the Urartian pantheon, ffaldi. TeiSeba and Siwini. Apart from other considerations, this fact alone suffices to prove that the Urartian civilization exerted a powerful influence, not only on Persia in the east, but in the west as well, on the cultures of the peoples of Asia Minor, and even played an important part in the formation of a significant portion of Greek mythology.
At the same time, one cannot escape the conclusion that if these Greek deities (i.e. the powerful Urartian triad) were Indo-European, then the ruling people in Urartu must have, likewise, been Indo-European. In fact it is already well known that aldi had never been a Hurrian deity.

OF THE ARMENIAN PEOPLE
I
. Hayk
The god Hayk, the mighty archer, has been closely interwoven with the life of the Armenian people since times immemorial, as ancient perhaps as the hunting stage of the primeval communal society. He was the principal indigenous deity of the most prominent (central) group of the Nairian tribes that have formed the Armenian people. We know that Hayk is none other than yaldi,50 and that Hayk-Haldi
49 Cronus is identi
f
ied with Bd and Nebrovi'(Nimrod) in Khorenalsi (1-7), implying thai he. too, was a god of firc-volcano. See below, the section on Vahagn. where we shall speak about the volcano of Mount Nemrut (Nebrovi1). 50 We have seen above that Hades is
t
faldi. The passage Haldi>Had(-cs) has taken place long before the fall of Urartu. It is not unlikely thai the following
passage could have also taken place at a later date:

was a deity of fire who had taken origin from the volcanic nature of the Armenian Highland. As mentioned earlier, Movses Khorenaisit drawing his information from Mar Aba*s book, uses a distinctive expression for Hayk: "the Yapelostean Hayk*'51 (tfSminbumupJjwOQ Ziujl4»« i.e. having the nature of Yapetos-Hephaestus). Remembering that Hephaestus was a god of fire, such a characterization of Hayk appears to have taken place during the Hellenistic (Artashessian) period of Armenia when Hayk's fiery nature was still remembered- Personified as the eponymic ancestor of the Armenian people, Hayk is also described as having 'Very curly hair and
sparkling eyes**
,52 a description that was inspired by his fiery nature and is paralleled with that given to Vahagn who, loo "had hair of frre, and his eyes were two suns-*' 1 In the old genealogical list preserved by Khorenatsi, Hayk is considered the son of Torgom. The origin of this name is linked with that of the city-land of Tarkuma/Tarljigama5* mentioned in Hiltite and Urartian inscriptions. It must be recalled that Hayk is a deity, hence, he should have been considered the son of the god Tarku, the god Tori' of the Armenians, whose name is the radical component of the name of this city Tarkuma/Tarhigama. Tork*s main temple was in Aghtznik (Arme-Shubria), at the Armenian sacred city-fortress Anget-Tun (Ingalava ?), now called EgU. Among Armenians Tork4 was also called Tork' Angel; Khorcnatsi refers to him as Tork' of Angel, i.e. Tork1 of Angelian descent. In the Old Armenian translation of the Bible, the god of the Underworld, Nergal of the Semitic text, is translated as Angel (who probably corresponds also to the Sumerian Engur, the god of the Abyss). Thus, it becomes easier to understand why Hayk, the god of volcano, is called "son of Torgom,** i.e. the son of Angelian Tork1, the god of the Underworld, because both the volcano and the god of volcano originate from the underworld forces, The epic of Hayk's fight against Bel provides a substantial proof
51 Khorcnatsi, 1-9, 52 Ibid.. I-I0.1I.
53 Some scholars locate this city in Hayasa, but others who place it in the southwestern regions of the Armenian Highland (NHt sec Tarkumah in Arme-Shubria, north of Syria (U/CN see Tarhigamani), seem to be more correct. In thisconnection it might be right to point out the village of Derik, below Angd Tun, in the region of the sources of the Kbabur, 40 km wesi of Mardin, As we have seen before, Adad-Nirari II called this region Hark* (Harki) which was in Armani as mentioned by Naram-Sin.



MYTHOLOGY 157
thai Hayk and his people were already in existence in the land called Hark', at the center of the Armenian-Nairian Highland, at the lime when Bel was carrying out his raids, thai is. when the mighty Assyro-Babylonian empire was seeking to expand; a proof which, unfortunately, has been overlooked by those who support the theory of migration of Armenians from the Balkans. These were the people of yaldi-Hayk, who, as the natives of their own highland, have fought long and bloody battles to protect their homeland against the Caucasian hordes from the north, the ScythoIranian and Central Asian marauders from the east, the mighty
Hitlites and other forces of Asia Minor from the west, as well as
the Assyro-Babylonian and Aramaean intruders of the Semitic world from the south. It was Hayk's people who stood up against
Bel and acted as a barrier before the unrestrained flood of the
Semites from the south, stopping it at the foothills of their highland. Because of the fact that the Armenian Highland is situated at the crossroads of continents where different civilizations have met. foreign deities have penetrated into the land in later periods, and Hayk. the indigenous god of the land was raised to heaven as a
star and identified with the constellation Orion.
II. Ara
Ara also has been the most ancient national god of the Armenians- He, loot was a native and eponymic deity of the Nairian tribes who formed the Armenian people and whose land was called Ar-meni (or Ar-ma-ni) after Ara's name. (This was already discussed in Chapter 2t under the Section "Am'i Land and People.*1) A large number of Nairian tribal names and the names of many cities, rivers and mountains in the Armenian Highland arc derived from Ar or Ara, such as, Ara$ani, Ar if Afbcrani, Aragadz, Arayi Lcr (Ara's Mountain), Ayrarat, etc. As one of the most ancient native deities of the Armenian HighLand, Ara was originally a deity of agriculture and vegetation, symbolizing the death and rebirth of nature. Later, as the Nairian tribes multiplied and were unified as a people, he was identified with the sun, just as the Assyrian god ASiur, who, earlier, when the Assyrians were peacefully occupied in tilling their land, was a god of ag
r
iculture symbolized by the tree of life, but later, as



I5S ARMENIA. SU8ARTU AND SUMER
Assyria became a mighiy empire, lurned lo a war-god and was
idenlified with the sun.54
One main difference between A$5ur and Ara was this, however, that while AiSur, because of the cruel nature he had acquired, was hated by other peoples and his name did not expand far, Ara, on the other hand, by the humane and lovable characteristics he had developed as a life-giving deity, had become very popular and his fame had spread out from his cradle, the Armenian Highland and the neighboring regions of Asia Minor (i.e. the Indo-European homeland), to distant countries and was adopted by many peoples. Of course, it is difficult to determine with accuracy the regions
and countries where Ara's cult (or Araism, as aptly called by Academician G. Ghapantsian) had spread, and the chronology of the development of the various phases of his character. Nevertheless, with the sparse data available, we can delineate the following regions where his cult had spread out: In the Armenian Highland, the cradle
of Araism. the names Ar and Ara were used interchangeably.
"
he was also called Ardi in the times of Urartu; among the Hittites in the west he was, likewise, known as Ara,54 whereas in Pamphylia he was called Er, in Thrace, Sparta, and Greece Ares, in Macedonia Aras, in Germany Ertag, and in Ireland Ir; in the north-east, in Georgia Arali;** in the vast Slavic plains of the north (Russia, the Ukraine, Belorussia) Var, Yarilo;59 in the south, in the city of Harran in Syria, Aru.60 in Babylonia Aria, and in Egypt Ra. Such a widespread dispersion, and so early in history, can only be explained by the power and the winsome nature of the source and also by its being located, as a center of radiation, at a favorable geographic position such as was the Armenian Highland.
Ar (or Ara) did not retain all his characteristics or all the
traits of his nature in every region where he was adopted. Certain
54 AT, 191.
55 l! is difficult lo connect ihe Indo-Iranian term ari (or Aryan) directly with the god Ar or Ara. This term ari has no mythological value. In old Inscriptions Ihe Indo-Iranian peoples have called themselves ari In a sense thai they were "full
men"
, probably In the sense of "free men", compared to Ihe peoples they had subdued. In Armenian ari means 'brave' and is linked with ihe word ayr ('man').

MYTHOLOGY 159
of his traits were emphasized and others minimized according to local influences and the psychological needs and tendencies of the people who adopted him. For example, in Thrace, Sparta, and Greece, Ares was a war- and sun-god; the same was true for Aras in Macedonia. The Hitlite Ara was a god of vegetation, the Georgian Ara/j and the Slavic Yar-Yarilo were gods of agriculture, and the Egyptian Ra was a sun-god.
It was noted earlier that in the time of Urartu Ara was also
called Ardi (Ar-di) from which was derived the name Ur~ardi (=Ur-anu)9 as mentioned by Sargon II, which meant 'the place of Ardi*, that is, Hhe land of Ara1. As already shown above, according to Khorenatsi, the name Ayrarar (which is related to the name Urartu), means *the plain of Ara'61 which correctly preserves the intrinsic meaning of Ur-ardi (Urartu) as 'the land of Ara9, equivalent to the term Ar-me-n/ ('the land of the sons of Ar'), It is certain that the name Ar (Ara). as a radical, is much older than its derivative form Ardi (Ar-di) that belongs to a much later, possibly the Uruatrian*Urartian, period. In the Ara-Shamiram legend Ara is represented as the sun-god while Shamiram appears to be the moon-goddess who is in love with Ara and desires to possess him as a lover or husband. But Ara prefers the genuine moon-goddess (and his wife) Nuard and refuses the enamored stranger Shamiram. Upon his rejection the moon-goddess Shamiram gathers her soldiers (the stars) and marches to Armenia against Ara, but when Shamiram and her soldiers (the moon and the stars) appear, the sun-god Ara dies (the sun sets) and the moon-goddess Shamiram does not succeed to meet him alive (while he is on the sky). It is obvious that this legend reflects the greedy desires of the Mesopotamian Semites to conquer the rich northern highlands (the land of Ara) and the struggle of Ara s freedom-loving people against foreign domination. We think it is very probable that the divine names Hayk and Ara, from which the Armenian people derive their name, are two different name forms for the one and same deity whereby different aspects of his nature are represented, the name Hayk designating his fiery character and the name Ara symbolizing him as a god of

vegeiaiion and the sun. And since, as we know, yaldi is the same as Hayk and Ardi is the same as Ara, then we should likewise assume that the name of the fire-god Ha/cfi (Hayk) and the name of the sun-god Ardi (Ara) are also two variants of the same name,
As an evidence, we can mention the fact that Musasir, where Haldi's
temple was located, was called Ardi-ni instead of Hatdi-ni, thus indicating that the names Haldi and Ardi were identical. In facl» in Urartian inscriptions Haldi is sometimes written in the form Aldi which appears lo be a variant of Ardi, I and r being conjugates. (Cf. Ararat>Alarot, Araga$>Alagyaz, Alzinini>Arzianene, etc.) Although Haldi-Aldi, as the supreme god of the kingdom, heads the Urartian pantheon, the form Ardi is preserved, for instance, in the place-name Ardini and also as a deity in the Urartian paniheon belonging to one of the Nairian tribes (hat formed the
Urartian union.
Thus, we see that Ara (Ardi), the eponymic god of the Armenian people and their land, was the native and genuine deity of the Nairian tribes of the Armenian Highland.
UL Astuas
Asluas (Uumntmi) is also one of the most ancient deities of the Armenian people. This name is so old, that even though in later times, due to various circumstances such as the adoption of foreign deities in Armenia, it ceased to be a proper name, rather than disappearing in oblivian, it was preserved in the Armenian language as a common noun. This proves its antiquity and national authenticity. In the last century a number of scholars, under the influence of the false hypothesis that assumed Europe to be the homeland of the parent Indo-European language, have tried to connect the Armenians with the Thraco-Phrygians- (In this effort they were swayed by certain cultural similarities that could have existed between the latter and the Armenians living in the neighboring HayasaTarhigama region in Eastern Asia Minor.) Lead by this migration" theory and based on interpretations of certain old sources accomodated to it, they have made the Armenian word Astuas derive from the name of the Phrygian deity Savazios. Not mentioning for the moment a scries of evidences that contradict this, the derivation of Astuas, from Savazios becomes



MYTHOLOGY 161
immensely difficult even on phonetic grounds: to make the first syllable change from sav lo astu is purely arbiltary and baseless. We believe that, as mentioned earlier, the divine name Savaz(ios}. like the Greek Zeus, is linked lo the name SibiS (SiwinO-SahaS,6* whereas the Armenian Astuas. which conies from very remote antiquity (as will be shown below In connection with AStuaS), has no relationship at all with Savaz(ios). The Astua$ of the Armenian people was a deity of fire. This divine name (ASlu-a$) is a Nairian word and It is not unlikely that in the remote past it may have been connected to the AssyroBabylonian word iSatu which meant 'fire*. Astua$, as the principal national deity of the Armenians (Hayk-Haldi), was the greatest of all gods and as ihe father of all was elevated to heaven. In the Achaemenian period the Armenians adopted Ahura-Mazda, who replaced Astuas in the Armenian pantheon, but by changing the name Ahura to Ara, the name of their national god, they armenianized him and called him Ara-mazd (Aramazd), reserving the name Ormizd to the real Iranian Ahuramazda adopted from the Pahlavi forms Hormizd and Ormizd.
During the Hellenistic period, introduced in Armenia by the Arlashessian dynasty, Astua$ became identified with "Dios-Zeus, the father of gods, the creator of heaven and earth," and when
Christianity came, he was identified with Jehovah as the heavenly father and the creator of all things. It seems natural that in Armenia, after the days of Urartu, when Astuaj would cede his place successively to Aramazd. Dios-Zeus, and Jehovah, the name Astuas would cease to be a proper name and would be retained in the language merely as a common noun. The name Astuag (Astu-as), as the name of a native deity of
f
ire, is connected with the word asfu ('fire') which is a component of Ur-aStu ( = Ur-Arfu), the name of the country, and Ai(j-Sat, the
name of the city that was the greatest religious center of
f
ire-worshiping Armenia. This same name Asfu-a is also encountered in the divine names Unag-aSluaS and AStupinu (AStu-pinu), belonging to Hayasa and Subarians, respectively. It is clear, therefore, that the attempt to derive the Armenian Astua$ from the Phrygian Savazios. as well as the "migration" hypothesis of the Armens, must be considered outdated misconceptions.
62 la the Ugarit inscriptions we find, as already mcmioncd, SspMi (or Stbai) instead of the EbUile SipiS (or SibiS).



163 ARMENIA, SUBARTU AND SUMER
The component astu of the name Asiuas (or AStu-aS) is a dialectal variant of the component artu of the name Ur-artu, with ihe r>S transition. It follows, then, that Astuas is just a variant of the name ILildi Aldi or Ardi (Anu>AStu) and is equivalent and synonymous to it. The form artu (Ur-artu) as a variant of aStu (Vr-aStu) is not
an uncommon occurrence in Armenian. In some Armenian dialects
ft replaces r before dental plosives. For example, in the Hamshen
dialect the word mardtk (iTmpn lj) is pronounced as maSdik (ifuiji l and Jrcrr'an>gcj(o/] (Ifbppiul cfb uioO); in the Hadjen dialect, ken4ayi>gaSti (Vbppmjfixfui iili); in the Nakhijevan dialect, mard>maSt* (ifmpr ifmjp-) and mort'i>moSt4i (ifnppJi>irojp'|i)> etc. Evidently, in the Bchistun inscriptions, writing Vr-aStu, instead of Ur-arru, was not a scribal error; it existed in the speech of the people* A further evidence is supplied by the name RStuni (atStu-ni) which preserves the memory of UraStu ( = Uranu). All these confirm that ihe name Ur-aAu contains the divine name A5ru(a5). It was already shown above, on different occasions, that the name Ardr (4sun') had a variant in the form of Ait; (or ArTu)
which, with rt<tr transposition, corresponded specifically to the
word afr (lump) signifying .fire'
.63 The Armenian language has
a number of words formed with arr, such as atraSek (atr-a-Seki 'red as fire') and atraSikanal (arr-a-Sikanal, 'to turn red as fire9) that have their parallel forms as artaSek fart-a~Sek) and artaSikanal farr-a-Sikanal).
To write art instead of air is not a scribal error either, since we
know that, in reality, the name Uru-arn had also a variant in the form of Ur-arti (or Ur-artu/ The aifu ('fire') form of the word artu or air should be compared not with the Pahlavi atur (Avestan &tarS) but, as already stated, with the Akkadian word iiatu ('fire')
63 According 10 Hllbschmann (see HABt article »wp»t afr) the Armenian ward afr enre') comes from the Pahlavi Hur of the same meaning. Certainly they are related, but it U more likely that they both originate from a common source. Linguistic exchanges between Pahlavi and Armenian must have occurred after the fall of Urartu. The fact that names such as Uru-arn and Ur-arru already existed long before in the Armenian Highland may suggest that Ihe Pahlavi word is borrowed from the Armenian, just as the Armenian word ptfa derived from the name of t aldi'i wife Waruba-ni has (probably) given rise to the Pahlavi synonym p4rJv» and not vice versa,



MYTHOLOGY 163
In the times of Assyria and Urariu, Armenia was a land of active volcanoes wilh a number of peaks in the Lake Van region, such as the Uruairi mountian (Mount Djuti), the Nemrut, the Varag and the Tondursk, erupting periodically. Mount Nemnil's famous crater was active until the 1440s and Tondurak, still smoking, is not completely extinct,64 The entire area that surrounded
Lake Van was considered a land of fire and because of this reason
it was called by the Assyrian kings Uruat
r
i (later Urartu), which literally means 'place of fire*. The aStu-iSatu connection becomes more intelligible if we
keep in mind thai the series of names we considered, Uruat
r
i, Urardi-Urartu and UraStu, are merely different forms of the same name given to Armenia by the Semitic Assyro-Babylonian kings
of the south, because for them, that land of active volcanoes was
just a "land of fire/* This is why the form Ur-a&u in the Akkadian text of the Bchistun inscription was more intelligible than the form Vr-artu: the actual name of the country in question was
de
r
ived from the name Ar (Ara) and was called Armani or Armcnit which meant, as was shown earlier, *sons of Ar* or 4the land of the sons of Ar*; hence, the name Ur-aSru utilized in the Akkadian version of Behistun inscription is the direct translation of the name Armina (Armenia) of the Persian original. The only difference in the meanings of the names Armcni and Urartu was that while the former designated it as the land of the sons of the local god (4the sons of Ar*), the second meant merely the land of the local god (4land of fire*), In the light of what has been said above about the Armenian divine name Astua$, il becomes obvious now that it could not have originated from the Phrygian Savazios, a name (Savaz-ios) which appears rather to be connected to Zeus<5j6ji (Siwini). The name Astua$ is already encountered with in the name Vr-aStu (Ur-artu) and in the divine names Unag-aStuaS of Hayasa and AStu-pinu of
the Suba
r
ians, And since the Semitic world has preserved a synonymous and homophonous word, iSatu, meaning Tire*
, then the source
of all these must be looked for in the land of Subartu, whose god AStupinu has already been referred to above. In conclusion, referring to the divine names Hayk (=l$aSdi)t Ara (=Ardi) and Astua$ (=AStuaS), we can say that Hayk, the national deity of the Armenians, having in the beginning powers on the
64 HPA* I0-1L



164 ARMENIA, SUBARTU AND SUMER
animal (hunting) and the vegetal (agriculture) domains, has developed a fiery nature and evolved into a sun* and war-god. His powers as a god of vegetation and, later, as a sun-god, were represented by Ara, whereas his powers on the animal world and on fire were symbolized by Astuas. These two, Ara and Asians, have been combined in Haldi, who, because of the presence of Siwini,
has preserved only his
f
iery (volcano) and vegetal (poplar tree) natures. The following statements and equations summarize it all:
I
. If the temple of Ardi-ni (of Musasir) is Haldi's temple, then Haldi (Aldi) = Ardi
2
, If the goddess Nu-ard (the Nu of Ard) is Ara's wife, then Ard (Ardi) = Ara
3
. And if Ur-ardi = Ur-artu = Ur-aStu» then Ara = Ardi (Arlu) = AStu (Astu-as)
As we speak about the interrelationships between (he names Armani (Armeni), Hayk (Hayastan) and Urartu, we must have in view, the following "divine" formula:
Haldi = ( Ar<** ' Ara (vegetation, sun)
i Astuas (fire) 1 ~ Hayk
IV. Nuard-Anahit
We know from the Aratla-Erech epic tales that Inanna was the goddess of Aratta, as well as that of the city of Erech (Uruk) in Sumer. This deity was known in Babylon by the name IStar. Dumuzi (Tammuz) was Inanna's consort in Sumer ([Star's in Babylon), whom Armcnologists, based on similarities in traits of character, identify with Ara-65 Since, as mentioned earlier, Nuard was Ara's wife, it becomes clear that the goddess Inanna is perpetuated
in Armenia in the name Nuard.
The name Nu-ard is composed of the componenis nu and ard, each having, in its compact form, a specific meaning. Nu represents the name of the goddess Inanna-Anahit (and/or Nane), and the component ard, representing the sun-god Ardi, is none other than
65 AGP, 41-47,



MYTHOLOGY 165
Ar (or Ara) in its derived form Ar-di. The word nu still exists in the Armenian language meaning bride*, therefore. Nu-ard would literally mean 'the nu of ard'. that is, 'Ardi's or Ara's bride or wife'. This concurs with Khorenalsi's statement thai Nuard was
Ara's wife.
The structure of the word Nu-ard can be compared with that of the name of the Urartian goddess Selardi or Sielardi (Siel-ardi), about which N. Adontz writes: "To derive this word by compounding Siela ('wife or sister') and ardi ('sun') is tempting. In the East, from ancient times to the present, the moon has always been consi
dered to be the sun's sister,
"56 or in certain regions, his wife. Sel (or Siel) reminds us of the known moon-goddess Selene or the Urartian goddess Si7/a. The structural parallel between the names Nu-ard and Sid-ardi is obvious: Nu corresponds to SiW and Ard to Ardi who is none other than ihe sun-god. We know thai Haldi was a god of fire and, as Aldi-Ardi, he was idemificd with the sun. It seems that in the limes of Urartu.
with Siwini's presence in the Urartian pantheon as a sun-god. he had preserved only his fire and volcano nature, but the form Ardi of his name was retained in the name Ardi-ni of Musasir and also
by one of the Urartian tribes as a luminous star. similar to Hayk who was subsequently identified with Orion. The composition of the name Nu-ard and Sel-ardi has its parallel also in the name Sinuiardi (Sinui-ardi) which appears to be a goddess of the Nairian tribe Sinibirni. As it was mentioned earlier, in antiquity, Ara's name and fame spread out from the Armenian Highland (probably with migrating Armens in certain cases) also to Ihe West. There is no doubt that Ares is the same as Ara. N. Adontz gives the following most important information that confirms the composition of the name
Nu-ard:
In Homer, Arcs' consort was called Enio ... Ares's rela
tion with Enio is an old memory and important, it seems that this female personage, Enio. is none other than Aphrodite's predecessor. The Pelasgian Aphrodite occupied the position of the Thracian Enio with regards to Ares. ... The inti
macy between Enio and Ares was still remembered in the 4th century and the custom of sacrificing slaves to Ares and
66 HA. 226.



166 ARMENIA. SUBAKTU AND SUMER
Enio still prevailed in Thrace. ... We believe that Enio's
name as Enn or Enuo. is none other than a different form of the name Nana or N/na.67
To this we can add the following quotation:
Ptolemy Philadelphus deified himself and his wife Arsi
noein his lifetime. ... The cult of Aphrodiie-Arsinoe was established, in other words. Arsinoe's worship was associated with that of the goddess Aphrodite.68
Here, too, we find that the name Ars-inoe has exactly the same structure as that of Nu-ard, Ars-inot meaning 'Arcs's Enio' where Ares corresponds to Ard (Ara) and Enio to Nu in our name Nu-ard. We see clearly that the name Nu-ard has the same composition as the names Sd-ardi, Sinui-ardi and Ars-inoe, and means 'the nu of ard', that is 'the bride (or wife) of Ard (or Ara)"
.
As we have seen. Ara's wife Nu-ard incorporates Dumuzi's wife Inanna, who was known in Armenia by the name Anunit
Anahit.
Anahit was the best loved and respected national goddess of the Armenian people. In better known times she occupied the foremost position among all deities in Armenia. The protection
and the care of the land were entrusted to her. She was the mother
of all sobriety, virtuous and benevolent. Among all the Armenian deities she only had a statue of pure gold. In the later periods of paganism she was associated with the moon. In the Artashessian period one of Anahit's most famous temples was at the city of Erez (Erzinjan), There were many temples dedicated to her throughout the country, but one of the most important was at the city of Ashtishal, in the Mush region, which for some time served as the principal religious center of the Armenian people. She also had a temple at the city of Anashat, in the Ararat valley, and another one of her oldest temples must have existed on the Medza
mor river. Some believe that the name Anahit has come to Armenia from
Iran, but it is difficult to concur with such an opinion. Iran has never

MYTHOLOGY 167
tolerated the rule of women; generally no goddesses strike us in the Iranian pantheon and AnahiiN presence (here seems to be merely inddenial; she never had there the amount of respect and honor that she enjoyed in Armenia- Solomon Reinach, the expert on world mythology, says that Anahit was a foreign presence in Iran, He writes: "The goddess Anflhita (the Lydian Anaitis) was of foreign origin (in Iran). The Iranian pantheon isv as a rule, deficient in goddesses* woman was always suspect, and the religious law aggravated the miseries of their sex ".9 Ii is very difficult, therefore, to accept that the
Armenians could have borrowed their most beloved and notable
goddess Anahit from Iran, where she was a foreigner herself. In conclusion, we can say that the goddess Anahit comes from antiquity and is indigenous to the Armenian Highland; she is identical with Inanna-Anunit, the very famous goddess of Aratta, who had acquired preeminence as early as the beginning of the third millenium B.C. She was the goddess who was worshiped in Medzamor, probably as the star Sirius, in 2800 B.C., at a time, when the Persians did not even exist in Iran. We must accept, therefore, that Anahit was a native goddess in the Armenian Highland. As for her presence among the Iranians (if it is of old), it can be explained by the fact that they must have taken her with them as they moved away from the Armenian Highland,
V
. AstUk
Astlik was a goddess of love, beauty, fertility and waters. She
was Vahagn's wife or mistress.
Her name is quite interesting. Some believe that it is derived from the Semitic I&ar and others from the GreaIt-sounding Astarte, but the name Aslik suggests some other origin. We do not see any reason why this word astHk could not be linked directly with the Armenain word asU mumq. "star'). Wc know thai asf/ is a genuine Armenian word of Indo-European origin. According to Adjarian, the Indo-European root of this word
is sicr from which are derived the Sanskrit and Avesian star. Pah
law star, Persian sil&ra, Afgan siOrai. Latin and Italian stclla, French astrc. Spanish astro. German srern. English star. etc. The
W OMR. to.



168 ARMENIA. SUBARTU AND SUMER
J sound in astt (and in Astlik) corresponds to / rather than to r,
hence, the Armenian word asr/ seems to be linked with the Latin
sictfa group rather that with the Semitic Htar. Therefore, AsUik is connected more closely with the native Indo-European circle
rather than with the Semitic.
It is not improbable, of course, that the Semitic divine names, like the Assyro-Babylonian IStar, the Eblaite Ester, the Hebrew
Esther, the Phoenician Astoreth, etc., and the Indo-European
root stSr and its derivatives could all have been originated from
a common source; but it must be noted that the Semitic names
are all proper nouns, whereas the Indo-European ster and its derivatives in the various languages designate a common noun, against
which the Semites (Assyro-Babylonians) have the word kakkabu
( vS'jS' kawkabun in Arabic). It must be accepted, therefore,
that the Indo-European root (which had lost its mythological value, if it had any at all) is much older than the Semitic divine names. Furthermore, the Indo-European word must have been in the protolanguage prior to the third millcnium B.C.. long before anything is known about IStar's existence.
It is also probable that the Armenian native word asth in its derivative form Astl-ik, has regained its mythological value under the influence of the Assyro-Babilonian, or more likely, the
Subarian-Mitannian IStar. around the middle of the second millcn
ium B.C. (In fact, as we know from the Mitannian-Egyptian correspondence, Miiannians honored IStar and had sent her to Egypt on a couple of occasions to have her heal the pharaoh, their sonin-law). I think that the traits of motherhood and love, originally personified by Inanna-Nane, were later divided in two; Anabil retained the functions of motherhood, goodness, benevolence and the protection of the country, whereas the characteristics of love, beauty and fertility were passed on to Astlik.
VI. MihrorMher
As already pointed out, the most ancient and principal national deity of the Armenian people was the deity of the sun and fire. As time progressed, however, this great deity was divided in two, just as



MYTHOLOGY 169
it had occurred in the case of his consort, the goddess Inanna-Anahit. His nature of fire and his nature of the sun began to be represented separately and by different names. Thus, in Urartian times, his character of fire was represented by the name Haldi. and that of (he sun by the name Siwini. In Armenia, after the fall of the Urartian dynasty, the name Mihr was given to this one great deity that embodied the powers of fire and the sun. Says Academician B. Arakelian: "The cult of Mihr spread out west from the Iranian circles and encompassed the borders of the Roman Empire. In Armenia he was considered ... the god of fire and the sun. "10 While utilizing the name Mihr for this great god. the Armenians have, nonetheless, pictured him, as in Urartian times, with a duality of nature, distinguishing between his characteristics of fire and the sun. This is why, in the epic of David of Sasun, the god of fire is called Great Mher, whereas the sun-god is Mher Junior. This shows that among Armenians the fire-god was considered ancestral or had seniority and preeminence over the sun-god. just as Hayk, the fire-god, was ancestral to and greater than Ara, the sun-god. Similarly, in Urartian times, the fire-god f/a/di was considered greater and more important than the sun-god Siwini.
We think that much before the Achaemenians, in the times of
Mitanni, the name Mihr was already known to the people, particularly to those living in the regions of Mitanni or Armani-Subari (and later Arme-Subria) where Sasun is located, in the form of M/rra (or perhaps even as Mher). Otherwise, it would not have been so readily accepted by the people during the Achaemcnian period or later. That Grear Mher represented Haldi is evidenced by the fact that he was called 'the lion-like Mher*. reminding us of Hald s representations in Urartian wall paintings where he is pictured on a lion. Furthermore. Mher's wife was called Armaghan, a name which appears to be a distortion of Aruban(i), the name of Haldi'
s
wife.
It is known that the crow was a symbol of the sun and fire; "its feathers were black because they were charred by it." Mher Junior had inherited Great Mher s position; consequently, he had held, in his turn, the position of the great Urartian gods or preserved in him their memory. "According to a tradition, Mher, disillusioned

with all the injustice in the world, had cloistered himself in a cave called Agravak'ar CCrow's Slonc') in Van."11 Wc already know thai on a cliff called Mheri Dur (£Mher's Galc?) in Vant there is a large inscription written by Upuini and Menua, which lists the names of all the Uranian gods. All these show that at a time when it was even forgotten that these inscriptions represented actual writings, the Armenian tradition had preserved in Mher (particularly in the term Agravak'ar) the memory of the great Uranian gods.
According to a legend, every yearT at the feast of Ascention and the night of Variavar (a water festival), when heaven and earth kiss each other, Mher comes out (from his cave) with a horse of fire, circles the heaven and the earth, and
seeing that 'the earth cannot yet support his weight returns to his seclusion. One day in the future, Mher shall come out from his hiding place to deliver 4the Armenian world' from wicked forces and to establish a happy kingdom-72
In the epic of David of Sasun, after the death of the king of MMr, his young and beautiful widow Ismil Khatun sends word to Great Mher in Sasun bidding him to come and marry her and possess the land of Ms r, even though Mher already had his own
wife Armaghan. This legend reminds us of a similar episode in the epic of Ara
and Shamiram, where Shamiram, likewise, after the dealh of her husband Nines, sends a herald to Ara in Armenia, inviting him to become her husband and to rule over Ninevah and the entire kingdom, even though Ara, too, has his own wife Nuard. Thus, we sec striking similarities not only between the two
stories where Ismil Khatun and Shamiram, each in her turn, feel
a passion for and make propositions to Mher and Ara, respectively, but also between the very names of /smjV and Shamir(am) and
also between the name of Mher's wife Armaghann and that of
Haldi's wife Aruban(i), In the section on Astua$ we had arrived at the Ara = Ardi = Aldi (Haldi) equation; now we can add another one to it: the Mher = Haldi mythological connection*

VII. Vahagn
i
" .
Vahagn was also one of the mosl ancient deities of the Armenian people. In the Urartian cuneiform inscriptions written in one of the later Hurrian dialects during the Urartian period, his name was substituted by TeiSeba, and during the Hellenistic period of the Artashessian dynasty he was replaced by Heracles. We know that
TeSob-TeiSeba and Heracles were of similar nature. Heracles' wife
was called IJebe, and TeiSeba's Huba. Huba was a goddess of love (and we think it is very likely that the Arabic word v bub, 'love', preserves the memory of this goddess and it also shows that the real form of her name is tfuba instead of tfebe or Heba), and so was AsiUk. Vahagn's wife (or mistress) who had her parallel in IStar
in the Semitic world.
Formerly Vahagn was a god of volcano which explains his fiery nature. Because of this particular characteristic, he, too, along with Hayk- aldi, the god of fire and volcano, was considered the ancestor of the Armenian people.74 The task of ascertaining the origin of the name Vahagn has not been without controversy. Just as some authors, based on the false "migralion,, hypothesis of the Armens, have tried to derive the
Armenian divine name Astuas from the Phrygian Savazios, others, In a similar trend of thinking, have searched the solution of some of the difficult problems of the origin of the Armenian culture shrouded in the dark veil of antiquity, in places other than the Armenian Highland, particularly in Iran, and were consequently led to derive, erroneously, the name Vahagn from the Iranian name Veretrana or Verefrag/ia. To derive the sound h in Va/iagn from the retr group in Vererragna is difficult indeed! It is true that certain later traits of Vahagn's character could be associated with the nature of Vcretragna as he was associated with Heracles, but to see a connection between their names is farfetched.
Vahagn, with his original nature as a god of fire and volcano. was born in the heart of the Armenian Highland, around the Lake Van region. He was a native deity and comes from very remote
antiquity.

In order to understand the origin of his name and to picture accurately his basic nature, it is essential to have in view the geographical and physical features of the Lake Van region of the Armenian Highland and also the linguistico-cultural relations that existed between the Armenians and the Sumerians in the distant past. If is not necessary to speak here at length about the SumeroArmcnian cultural and linguistic connections, since this topic has been already dealt with in detail in our previous works- In an earlier chapter reference was made also to the close cultural links that existed between Aralta and Ercch at ihe beginning of the third
millenium B.C.
Traces of cultural and linguistic connections between Armenians and Sumerians are being uncovered and they are of such a nature that their evaluation would be very difficult without accepting the existence of a close relationship between these two peoples in the remote past. Even there are indications that these relationships have existed before the Armenian language was separated from the parent Indo-European speech or immediately after. In my work TTie Origin of the Armenian People (in Armenian) I have listed more than
one hundred Sumerian words and word-connections and their
Armenian equivalents, nearly half of which are indo-European. More than 200 Sumerian-Armenian parallels and coincidences in vocabulary are known to us. In order to understand the formation of the name Vahagn, we must keep in mind, in addition to the Sumero-Armenian linguistic
and cultural relations, the intense volcanic activities of the mountains around Lake Van in those ancient limes, because of which that
particular country was called Mand of fire'
.
In pagan antiquity fire-worshipers utilized torches that con
sisted of a reed with some kind of an inflammable material fastened
at one end. This picture is very aptly conveyed by the Sumerian term giizilal Otorch1) which is a compound word composed of three radicals, gi-ia*!al915 wheregi means 'reed*, jzj 'fire' and lal 'to carry'Hence, gi-izi-lal means ' fire-carrying reed* which clearly expresses
the idea of a *torch'
. This practice developed further in the later periods of paganism and even after the arrival of Christianity it persisted in the use of candlesticks.

MYTHOLOGY 173
Thus, the reed was closely linked with the idea of fire and its cult, and it was probably because of this connection that it acquired a totemic significance in mythology. Moreover, reeds were burned to keep the sacred fire alive, as indicated by the (races of rccds found in the ashes of the altar in the temple at Medzamor.'* As fire was an object of worship, U was very often kept burning at the top of a long reed. In the well-known song of praise that was sung to Vahagn in the olden days in Armenia, the following picture is depicted:
Out of the reed smoke came forth. Out of the reed flames came forth.
And out of the flames a blond boy came forth.
He had hair of fire,
As wc sec, the birth of Vahagn is pictured here as a flame coming out of a reed. In fact, the name Vahagn (Vah[a}gn) is the very same Sumerian term Bil-gin ('blazing reed*) that indicates the fire-god. In Sumerian gibil means Tire* and 'torch*, which literally (gi + bil) means *rced + blazing*. The term gibil, representing the
fire-god, was w
r
itten as BIL-GI77 (actually BIL-GIN)71 and literally meant 'blazing reed'. In Sumerian bil means 'lo burn* or 4aflame' and gi (actually gin) 'reedV Therefore, Bil-gin means a *blazing reed* and represents the fire-god. The word Bil-gin is stressed on the first syllable bil (in cuneiform it is also pronounced as bcl which might have been the origin of the name of the Babylonian god Bel) which, by the b>v and l>l>h phonetic changes has given vj7 (vei) wi/>va/i,79and the syllable gin, as the second and last unstressed syllable, has lost the sound i and become gn fea/tX Thus Bilgin is transformed to

There is also in Armenian the word c)ibQ (ggn), which is used only in derivative forms such as gana/iarW. ganakodicl («|piQwhmpbi, quiQwlinfthi) that obviously meant 'to beat with a

Vah(a)gnt0 (a U a conjunction in Armenian). We shall give below a number of evidences that prove this point, but it is worth mentioning now the following: In Kommagene, the kings of the Armenian Ervanduni dynasty used to call Vahagn Artagncs [Art-a-gn-ics)/* This shows that those kings, knowing that the component Vah of the name Vah-a-gn meant Tire* or ame*, have exchanged it with the word an (Tire*) of equivalent meaning but much more in common use at the time, and thus Vahagn had become Arlagn[es| (-es being a Greek suffix), It was already shown above, in connection with (he etymology of the word Asiu-ast thai the syllable arr (artu>aStu) means 'fire* and thai it is also found in the name Ur-artu (Ur-aStu) which signifies 'place of fire'
. Probably, the idea of Tire' is also inherent in the expression am~aStu ("to burn1) found in Urartian inscriptions. It must be pointed o«jt here that the name ASliSat (ASti-ial) of the cily where the temple of the fire-god Vahagn was located,
means 4dty of
f
ire'
, with the first syllable aSt (aSti) meaning .fire1, and the last syllable Sat meaning *city\ (For the word aSt, remember aStanak (aSt-anak) 'candlestick* which literally means 'fire carrier*,111 and compare it with Xam-anak, 'time*
. Cod-anak, 'pendulum*, SrJ-anak 'frame or circle', etc. As for Sal meaning 'city', compare Anaial, Ervandaiar, ZariSat, etc.) This particular meaning of AStitar (*cl(y of fire*) was due to its being the site of the temple of the fire-god Vahagn (as Musasir was called Ardini after HakJi).
This speci
f
ic meaning of 'flaming* or 'aflame' of the component vah is revealed in the name Vahunik\ a collective name given to the priests of the temple of AStiSat whose duty it was to keep the sacred fire continually burning. This priestly function was hereditary and
it was considered such an honored vocation that their entire house
hold was called Vahunik' and their temple Vahevahian. Another indication showing that the word vah conveys the

This is why Adjarian (HAB) tries to explain the word atranaJc in the sense of A\o sp
r

MYTHOLOGY 175
meaning of 'burning' or 'aflame' is provided in a folk song traditionally sung at weddings in Van. Early in the morning following the night of marriage all the guests used to climb to the roof of the house together with the bride and the groom and facing cast in anticipation of the rising sun they used to sing the following song:
Hail to the dawn, hail to the dawn!
Hail to the rising sun! May it give plenty of sun to our king.
VaW! VaM! Hail to the dawn, hail to the dawn!
Hail (o the rising sunt May it give plenty of sun to our queen.
Vah6! VaWI"
The words "Vahe! Vahe!" addressed to the rising sun meant 'shine bright (rise), be ablaze!' Most probably, the actual meaning of these words were forgotten throughout the centuries and the people kept repealing them as a traditional custom, just as today people keep repeating words like "Amen" and "Hosanna'* in religious hymns whose meaning have long since been forgotten. The fiery nature of Vahagn originates from the fact that initially he was a deity of volcano. One of the titles by which he was known among the Armenian people was vigapak'at (itti unquifiurf), a title which characterizes his original nature and reveals its association with the worship of fire bursting out of an active volcano. The last syllable of this term, k'at, was erroneously connected to the Armenian verb k'alel (frnqb), 'to reap, to pick') and visapak'at was understood to mean 'dragon-reaper' or 'dragon-killer', whereas the word k'al indicates 'a monster that spews out fire from its mouth'
.
Therefore, the term WsapaJc'a/ represents just the volcano, the
object of worship as a
f
ire-spitting and fearsome monster. This particular meaning of the word k .ii is accurately explained by

In the name of (his giant is seen the expression 'Papaios Chimaeragenes.' that is, 'Papaios, born of Chimacra"
which is rendered k'aha (fiu/jb
r
nj) in Armenian, that is
"(he offspring of k'al. The chief among the titans was Typhon (Typhaeus, who was in fact a smoke-ejecting giant) ... His child was Chimacra, which means kai, a fire-breathing monster. He was the symbol of a volcanic mountain in Lycia."
The Armenian word Jc'a/ should also be compared with the
Sumcrian word gSl, "EIttT which means 'storm demon*.14
Now that we know the real meaning of this word k'al, it becomes very easy to understand that the title visapak'al, attributed to (he Ore-god Vahagn. designates him as a fire-spitting dragonmonster. symbolizing a terrifying active volcano. This also reveals that the temple at AStiSat was a famous fireworshiping center which was previously connected to the cull of an active volcano. Of course, this site of worship could not have been very close to the volcano, neither too far from it; it should have been al best within visual distance from the erupting crater. The only mountain that corresponds to this geographic condition is Mount Nemrul on the western shore of Lake Van, which is comfortably visible from AStiiat and the Plain of Mush. Mount Nemrut (now
extinct) was active until the 1440s and even later.85 lis summit rises
3050 m from the sea level and 1330 m from the surface of Lake
Van. Its majestic cone rules not only all over Taron but also over the entire surroundings of the lake. It is obvious thai this crater with its awsomc and thunderous eruptions would be pictured by the pagan people of the day as a gigantic fire-breathing dragon-monster
and would command veneration and worship as a
f
ire-god. The map below, reproduced from Henry Lynch's book Armenia pictures impressively the prominence of the circular craier of this mountain. We believe that, earlier, the crater of Mount Nemrul was an island in the lake, near the shore, and that massive flows of lava
have eventually joined the island to the shore. This idea seems to be expressed also by the map where we see the crater surrounded by
undulations of solidified lava.

a/*r of Mount Nemrul.
It is not difficult to imagine the awe-inspiring and enchanting scene provided by an erupting volcano, standing 1330 metres high above the surface of the lake, bellowing out columns of fire and smoke hundreds of metres high into the air. Watching such an astonishing and fearsome manifestation, particularly at night, would overwhelm the pagan observer with fear and divine power. Bright flames with thunderous ejections rising to the sky and bathing the air and the water in red and purple glares, when nature seemed to be in turmoil, would evoke in his mind the birth of Vahagn. the fire-spitting monster, for which heaven and earth and the sea were in labor, and would inspire him to sing:
Heaven and earth were in labor,
And in labor was the purple sea,
And in labor was the red reed in the sea,
Out of the reed smoke came forth, Out of the reed flames came forth, And out of the flames a blonde boy came forth.

He had hair of fire, And a beard of flame, And his eyes were two suns,
The expression "the purple sea'* in the poem was nol quite understood until recently. But the song clearly states that as Vahagn was born (that is, as the flames from the volcano burst into the sky), the sea, taking part in (he labor, turned purple. This expression in itself provides an important proof lhat this poem, as well as Vahagn, were associated with the famous volcano of Mount Nemrut, Another imporianl proof relating Vahagn as a god of volcano to Mount Nemrul (even to the name Nemrut as the name of a deity of fire-volcano) is supplied by the existence of a huge statue of Vahagn that was erected by the Armenian Ervanduni king Alexander on Mount Nemrut in Kommagene.86 We find that with the Sumerian term Bilgin, from which Ihe name Vahagn is derived, is also linked the term Vulcan which is considered a god of fire in Roman mythology and is the origin of the word volcano in all European languages (Lat. vu/can, Ital. and Eng. vo/cano, Fr. volcan, Rus. vulkan etc.)- The Arabic word (burkan, 'volcano') also must have come from the same origin. It is probable lhat other volcanic mountains in (he surroundings of Lake Van had names similar to lhat of Vahagn (derived from the term bilgin) and that there were temples built not very far from their craters. One such mountain was Mount Varag with a temple dedicated to Vahagn on one of its slopes- The difference between (he names Vah-agn and Var-agftj) consists of the phonetic transformation l>h/T in (he syllables vah and var which can be attributed to dialectal variations in the speeches of Nairian tribes living in the two different places, AStiSat and Varag, A similar phenomenon is observed in Arabic. As Vahagn was identified wi(h the sun in
later periods, a certain Arabic (or Semitic) race has preserved the deity of fW /n in the form JiU , falak(un), elcva(ing him lo the sky or lo a heavenly orbit- The Arabic form falak(un) and the Armenian forms Vahagn and Varag are very close phonetically: in both (he vowel a has replaced the i (or the e) in the word Bil (or Be/), whereas the European form Vu/can is closer to the Arabic

Arabic: fal-a-k(un} ( iUi , 'heaven, orbit')
Armenian: Vab-a-gn (god of fire-volcano >sun-god)
Armenian Var-a-ag(n) (mountain and Vahagn's temple)
Arabic: bur-kan ( OK * .'volcano*)
Roman: VuZ-can (fire-god)
European: vol-can(o) ('volcano')
In the light of this lengthy discussion it will be clear now that Vahagn was a deity of fire and volcano and that the translation of his name to Artagn(es) in FCommagene was not incorrect, since an means 'fire*. It is also clear now that the name Vahagn has no relationship at all with the Irano-Indian name Veretragna (or Vrtraghna), which is the title of the Indian storm-god Indra and means 'dragon-killer'. (See HHGP, 32.) We have already shown that the title viSapak'ai given to Vahagn did not mean 'dragonkiller' but 'dragon-monster'. During the Hellenistic period in Armenia Vahagn was identified with Heracles symbolized by a lion (itself a symbol of fire). According to one tradition. Heracles has set free the titan Prometheus who was chained to Mount Caucasus for having stolen the divine fire for mankind from (he forge of his comrade Hephaestus, under Mount Moschylus.81 As it was said above, the term BIL-GIN (dgi-bil) that represented a deity of fire and was the origin of Vahagn's name, had its first component bil pronounced also as bel. We find this in the name of the Babylonian fire-god Bel who was fought and defeated
by the national fire-god of the Armenians, "the Yapelostean Hayk." Khorcnatsi identi
f
ies Bel with Nebrovt. He writes: "And many chroniclers have convinced us that Nebrovt, who is Bel, This explains why this crater, associated with Vahagn who was the same as Bel (Bil-gin), was called Nebrovt >Nebrul>Nemrut. There is another evidence proving this connection. G. Servantzlianlz

The burning of Bel in Nemrut's hearth echoes the connection between the fire-god Bel (and BilginVahagn as well) and the mountain's crater. It can be accepted, there* fore, that Va/iagn is the name given to the volcano of Mount Nemrut and that the song which describes his birth was composed at a lime

. BIAINA
I have already shown on a number of occasions that in the name Uruatri (Uru-atri) or Ur-artu (>Ur-aStu) the component atri (orartu>aStu) means lfire' and Urartu 'place of fire'. In Urartian inscriptions of later periods, instead of Urartu (Nairi) generally the term Biaina (or Biainili) is used which is the translation or a synonym of Urartu and, likewise, means *place of fire'
. This shows
that the component bia of Bia-ina has exactly the same meaning as arfu in Urartu (or atri in Uru-atri and ardu in K/-ardu), that
is, 4fire'.
In fact, in the Sumerian language the word bil (lio burn, to be aflame') has a simpler form bi which is expressed by the
same group of cuneiform signs, t C T as the word bil and,
similarly» means 'to burn, Co be aflame'
. Therefore, the form bia
means 'fire'*90 The ending -ina (or ~na) in Bia-ina is a toponymic
suffix and is used in the sense of .place'
, (cf. Armcni-Armma,
89 Srvanlztiants, Crotz u Brois (in Armenian), p, 31-32, 90 As wc sec, many obscure Urartian-Armenian problems arc explained by means of tlie Sumerian language- These arc not just circumstantial phenomena; as far as linguistic connections and relations of spiritual culture between Sumerians and Armenians are concerned, these are only the lip of the iceberg, even though a lot of it has already melted.

WaSiukani-WaiSukana, etc-), thus making Bia-ina mean 'place of fire* and a synonym 10 Urartu. There is further evidence to prove this connection. As wc have seen, the name Vah-agn corresponds to the term Bil-gin where the components vah and bil are equivalent. Wc have also learned that in Kommagcne the name Art-agnfas) was used instead of Vahagn (Bil-gin)t where the component an (.fire*) was substituted for Bil> Vah ( aflame'), just as in the two corresponding names Bia-ina and Ur-artu (*place of fire*) Ul was substituted for aituThus it is further affirmed that Bia-ina means 'place of fire*. We know thai the name of the city of Van (Va-n) is derived from Biaina (Bia-ina), indicating thai va ('fire') comes from biat just as in the name Vah-agn, vah {'to be aflame') comes from the component bil of Hil-gin, with the l>h transition. Thus it becomes clear right away that the components vah (bil) in Vah-a-gn (Bil-gin) and va (bia) in Va-n (Bia-ina) both have the same Sumerian ori
gin1*1 and, as we shall see below, are connected also in their mythological significance. The meaning of the name Biaina as 'place of fire* helps immensely to the understanding of its social and religious nature, implying
91 An example of lhe close cultural relations bciwcen the Sumcrians and the
Armenians can be seen in the Sumerian word dagil J|**l-T to which the
meaning of 'safe, wide* is attributed- The ideogram representing this word, as
it can be seen clearly, consists of tf T ga ('house') in which is placed
the group of sigas for'god1
, that is, 'god within s house\ Such a house would certainly be a temple. We arc tempted to see a connection between this Sumerian word dMgMl and the Armenian /a£jr i SuiBuip, 'tempIe'K even though
Hilbschmann related it to the Persian ra&ra ('palace* wimer house') which does not give the meaning of 'temple'. The dagal-taCar connection gain strength also by the fact that the Sumerian word dagal has a synonymr (tc-gtl, expressed by
the same group of cuneiform signs ((god in a house')* with which, we think,
is related the Arabic word J * heykal, meaning, likewise, 'temple*. On
the other hand, there is a closer phonetic resemblance between the Sumerian dxgal and the Armenian dagal (i iuquiq, 'coffin') and a connection between their meanings could be detected if these two words (dngal and dagai} had meant previously 'tomb or shrine', in the sense thai laying the deified dead in a
tomb was placing him in safety. Compare Arm. shirim (;bpM< omb*) with Eng. shrine (probably cognate) in the sense of 'box for relics1, 'a saint*$ tomb', also 'altar, sanctuary-tempiIt is also possible that in the Armenian word dambaran (f)«ifpu|iuaQ, 'tomb') the component damb could be related to the Sumerian term dam-athba t'lbc cry of wailing women'), whereby damb-aran would mean 'a place of wailing* or 'a cemetary'

thai originally it was jus! thai, a place of fire, or a fire temple, around which selllcments were established, turning it eventually
into a city with its proper land. The Armenian language has preserved a word which may reveal an important connection between the term Biaina and its meaning as a 'place of fire' or, in a religious sense, a 'temple of fire'. This is the word vank' ('monastery* in current usage). As-we know, the name of the city of Van comes from the term Biaina. In this word vank' one must see a place or a temple of fire worship, surrounded with the house of Ihc priest-chieftain (or the palace of the priest-king), administrative and utility buildings and usually growing settlements of people around them with tracts of land under the jurisdiction of the temple. In vank'
. k' is a plural ending,
being at the same time a toponymic suffix that may also refer to the buildings and the land around the temple, just as Hayk' means not only 'Armenians' but also 'the place or the land of Armenians*. The temple alone was also called van (not van*:') as we find it in the following compounds: van-ere?, 'chaplain'
, van-a-hayr, 'abbot', vana-tun, 'convent'
, van-a-kan, 'monk', etc. It is clearly seen that the Armenian word van*' corresponds to and is derived from the earlier name Biaina (which, in fact, is also the origin of the name of the city of Van) which means 'temple of fire' including all the settlements and the land surrounding it, in other words, it means 'the center of a fire-worshiping tribe.' It is natural that in this land of volcanoes, fire would be the
object of worship of the native Nairian tribes and that a temple would be erected almost in every important center dedicated to the cult of the deity of fire or to Vahagn. Therefore, the central region of Urartu where the assembled Nairian tribes had their fire temples in the middle of their settlements, was called KVRBiainiU, 'land of
Biainas' (where the suffix -// is a plural ending similar to k' in van*'). It appears that the volcanic peaks such as the iVemrut, the Sipan, the Tondurek, the Varag, the Arros (art- 'fire') and others that surround Lake Van formed the contour of the central region of Urartu. In this circle were located Arzasku, the royal city of Arame. Arbu, Rusas' paternal city (on the eastern shore of the Lake), the capital Van (on the southeastern shore), and other cities, where there must have existed important temples dedicated to the fire-god Haldi. It was this very central region of Urartu, this area of volcanoes and famous fire temples, that was called KU*Biainili, that is,



MYTHOLOGY 183
iand of Biainas'.92
The land of each fire-worshiping Nairian tribe lhal was pan of ihe siruclure of the Urartian kingdom (especially those occupying a central location), with its religious and administrative nucleus, constituted a biaina for that particular tribe. Such was the central Biaina, with its templc-and-palacc complex in the capital called TuSpa, where was located, of course, the temple of the fire-god FJaldL This explains why the name of the capital city TuSpa (and not that of the province) has reached us as Van (Biaina), because the land of TuSpa was called Biaina by virtue of the presence of the fire temple in TuSpa, whereas the name Biainili was given to the entire central region of the county where there were a number of such biainas. These fire temples (hat were built not too far from volcanic peaks or craters around Lake Van were biainas (or vankS); but with the extinction of volcanoes and, later, with the arrival of Christianity, they lost the original function and meaning they had in Urartian times, preserving, however, the term vank4 for religious
institutions of similar nature.
It must be accepted, therefore, that those of the main and most ancient monasteries in Armenia that go back to pagan days, destroyed and rebuilt many times over, were originally biainas that belonged to the Nairian-Armenian tribes of the Urartian kingdom, and which, later, during the Arshakuni dynasty and in the early centuries of
the Christian era, became the distinctive monasteries of the Nakharar Houses that were the direct descendants of those main Nairian
tribes. Each Nairian tribe (and land) had its own armed forces. In lime of war they all united under the banner of the Urartian king and each biaina received its share of the spoils and slaves. After the fall of the Urartian dynasty, during the Arteshessian and the Arshakuni dynasties, the same arrangement continued. The Armenian Nakharar Houses, as the heirs of the Nairian tribes, hadf likewise, their own vank's (monasteries) and armies, which united in time of war under the king of Armenia and received their share of the spoils.
92 In antiquity the capital city of a country and the temple of its principal god, or the land and its temple were equivalent concepts. For example, here is a portion of the message sent to King Sennacherib of Assyria by one of his agents whose duty it was to follow the movements of King Rusas of Urartu: "All is well for Assyria, all is well for the temples ..." (Sec HA. 112).



184 ARMENIA, SUBARTU AND SUMER
The explanations given about the meaning of biaina make it clear that this word was not the name of a particular tribe. They
also show that those Nairian tribes thai with their land and rulers
formed the nucleus of the Urartian kingdom, were Armenians who considered themselves descended from the fire-god yaldl-Hayk (and also Vahagn). These arc the very same Nairian tribes, the southern regions of whose land was known In the past by the name Subartu in Assyro-Babylonian circles.
