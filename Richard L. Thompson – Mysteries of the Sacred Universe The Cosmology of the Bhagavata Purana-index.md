The Cosmology of the Bhagavata Purana



■
'



“Mysteries of the Sacred Universe is a very original book, and it represents
an important advance in theunderstanding of the cosmology described in
the famed Bhdgavata Purdna of India. Thompson looks at this cosmology
from several points of view and he presents a compelling case showing that
this cosmology was intended to have multiple meanings that span the
terrestrial, the astronomical, and the spiritual planes.”
—Professor Subash Kak, Louisiana State University
“Thompson takes us back in time when man regarded himself an integral
part of the cosmos and shows us how, in a strange way, such a system as
the Bhagavatam cosmology bears an uncanny harmony with modern
astronomy. More important and interesting is the way Thompson shows
how the Bhagavatam literature presents visual astronomy in geographical
and mythological settings which, in this respect, is very reminiscent of the
Pyramid Texts of ancient Egypt and many mythico-religious cosmologies
of other ancient cultures of the world... . Gripping, scholarly and ground¬
breaking, Mysteries of the Sacred Universe deserves to be widely read and
discussed.”
—Robert G. Bauval, author of The Orion Mystery
and coauthor of The Message of the Sphinx
“Dr. Thompson has a talent that may well be unique in our times: the ability
to take complex, esoteric ideas that require high level mathematics, special¬
ized technical expertise, and a familiarity with scholarship that spans the
history of civilized humanity, and presenting them to the lay reader in a
narrative style that is as user-friendly as a novel, but packed with sound
reasoning, solid scholarship, and impressive empirical research.”
—Professor William W. Wall, Santa Fe Community College, Florida
“Mr. Thompson’s premise is that the system of the Bhagavatam includes
some modern understandings of the science of astronomy, not just mythol¬
ogy. ... If the reader can judge what is science and what is not science,
putting aside the non-science aspects of the cosmology, it seems clear that
there are indeed a number of references to known scientific aspects of the
sky in the Bhagavatam. ”
—Jeanne E. Bishop, Planetarium Director, Westlake, Ohio
“A revolution in our understanding of the cosmology of the Purdnas is in
the making here. This book offers a way of reading ancient Indian texts
that is profoundly interesting, that overturns a long history of scholarly
undervaluation of the supposedly konly mythological' contents of Puranic
literature.”
Professor Gene R. Thursby, University of Florida ■

Introduction to Bhagavata Cosmology
The way people view the universe has a profound impact on their
understanding of themselves. Today we see the earth as a small, fragile
globe, orbiting at just the right distance from the sun for life to
flourish. It appears to be the only planet with life in the solar system,
and the planets themselves are mere specks in the vacuum of space.
Human life seems reduced to insignificance when set against the vast,
nearly empty spaces of modern astronomy.
But before the modern era, the universe often appeared much
more comfortable and accommodating. Thus medieval European
cosmology placed the earth in the center of a small, spherical universe
surrounded by the “coelum empireumthe abode of God and the
Elect. Within the sphere, the sun, the moon, and the planets out to
Saturn followed regulated orbits against the backdrop of the zodiacal
constellations. The earth, in the center, was at one end of a hierarchy
of being, connecting human beings with the heavenly realm.
In this study we will explore a similar, earth-centered conception
of the cosmos from India. This cosmological system is presented in
the Bhagavata Purana, or Srimad-Bhdgavatam, one of India’s impor¬
tant religious scriptures. For centuries it has provided a meaningful
framework, connecting the world of observable phenomena with the
transcendental world of ultimate reality.
The Bhagavatam describes innumerable universes. Each one is
contained in a spherical shell surrounded by layers of elemental mat¬
ter that mark the boundary between the transcendental and mundane
realms. The shell contains an earth disk—called Bhu-mandala or
“earth mandala”—that divides it into an upper, heavenly region and
a subterranean domain filled with amniotic waters. The shell and its
contents are characterized as the Brahmanda or “Brahma egg."

Bhu-mandala
Although the “earth” is here conceived of as a disk, it has little in
common with the familiar earth of day-to-day experience. The diam¬
eter of Bhu-mandala is given in the Bhagavatam, and it is about the
size of the orbit of Uranus. Bhu-mandala is divided into a series of
geographic features, called oceans and islands (dvipas in Sanskrit).
But these are geometrically perfect rings of cosmic size, with no resem¬
blance to irregular earthly continents.
In the center of Bhu-mandala is the circular “island” of Jambudvlpa,
with nine subdivisions called varsas. These include Bharata-varsa,
which can be understood in one sense as India and in another as the
region inhabited by ordinary human beings. Jambudvipa is centered
on the geometrically shaped Mount Sumeru, which represents the
world axis and is surmounted by the city of Brahma, the universal
creator.
At first glance, the cosmology of the Bhagavatam looks like an
imaginative production that has little in common with reality. How¬
ever, a deeper study shows a remarkable harmony between modern
astronomical findings and Bhagavata cosmology. To understand this,
it is necessary to realize that the Bhagavatam describes reality using its
own, uniquely premodern paradigm.
The Bhagavatam presents astronomy in geographical and mytho

logical language, and the mode of presentation is different from the
familiar modern approach. Modern cosmology aims to construct an
abstract model with a one-to-one correspondence between ele¬
ments of the model and elements of the universe. In contrast, the
Bhagavatam uses concrete themes and images in multiple ways to
represent different aspects of the universe. From the standpoint of
the Bhagavatam, the universe is a multidimensional system including
transcendental elements. Since the universe therefore cannot be en¬
compassed by a single mental model, the Bhagavatam freely uses
model elements in different convenient ways to represent different
aspects of the universe.
Although it may look like a naive flat-earth model, careful study
shows that the Bhagavatam uses the earth disk of Bhu-mandala to
represent at least four different things. These are:
1. The earth globe, mapped onto a plane by stereographic
projection.
2. A map of the geocentric orbits of the planets.
3. A local map of India, the Himalayan region, and nearby
territories in south-central Asia.
4. A map of the celestial regions inhabited by demigods.
The great Bengali saint Caitanya Mahaprabhu remarked that “In
each and every verse of Srimad-Bhagavatam and in each and every



4 Introduction to Bhagavata Cosmology
syllable, there are various meanings” (Caitanya-caritamrta, Madhya
lila 24318). This appears to be true, in particular, of the cosmological
section of the Bhagavatam, and it is interesting to see how some of
these meanings can be brought out and clarified with reference to
modern astronomy.
There are bound to be contradictions when one structure is used
to represent several different things in a composite map. But these do
not cause a problem if we understand the underlying intent. We can
draw a parallel with medieval paintings portraying several different
parts of a story in one composition. These also contain contradictions
(such as several instances of one character in a single painting), but a
person who understands the story line will not be disturbed by them.
The Bhagavatam does not describe the universe of galaxies and
quasars, but it does contain a solid core of material that agrees
remarkably well with the modern understanding of the earth globe
and the solar system. In this work we shall use modern astronomy as
a reference frame to elucidate Bhagavata cosmology. Many obscure
points stand out sharply in proper perspective when viewed in the
light of modern astronomical knowledge. This enables us to shed
new light on many topics in the Bhagavatam which have long been
poorly understood.
The question naturally arises as to whether modern astronomical
themes seen in an old text are really there, or are simply being read
into the text by hindsight. Were such themes intended by the original
authors, or is their apparent presence in the text due to coincidence
or loose interpretation? It is difficult to clearly answer this question in
all cases. Some of the correspondences with modern astronomy are
consistent with ancient Greek astronomy, and they could have been
intentionally built into a medieval Sanskrit work. Others go beyond
Greek astronomy, and it is hard to account for them historically.
Although some of these correspondences may be products of
chance, it is possible to show that some of them are statistically
significant. These might be the results of conscious scientific endeavor
in ancient times. Or they might be seen as intuitive harmonies be¬
tween nature and the Bhagavatam, depending on divine inspiration.
This study has been organized as a book and as a CD-ROM. The
book and the CD contain essentially the same text, but the book is
designed to be read sequentially from beginning to end, while the CD

has a hierarchical structure with hypertext links and a search engine.
The main body of the CD is illustrated with some 250 color pictures,
13 interactive picture sequences, and 24 animations, including a video
summarizing both this book and the CD.






Introduction to Texts
The source material for traditional Hindu astronomy and cosmol¬
ogy consists of Sanskrit texts that are being reproduced and repub¬
lished today as part of a living tradition. Unlike the situation in Egypt,
Mesopotamia, or Mesoamerica, there is practically no Indian cosmo¬
logical material available in the form of ancient manuscripts, tablets,
or inscriptions. Archeology may shed light on the material living
conditions of ancient Indian people, but it conveys practically nothing
about what they had to say. In India, long documents have generally
been written on palm leaves, which last for at most a few centuries in
the Indian climate.
Since we are dealing with a living cosmological tradition, none of
the material that we examine is demonstrably older than a few
hundred years. Texts preserved and reproduced by human beings are
inevitably subject to alteration, revision, imperfect copying, and loss.
However, a living tradition may preserve ideas and information that
date back arbitrarily far into the distant past. In this study, our main
emphasis is on the content of surviving cosmological ideas and not on
their history. But inevitably, we will run across material that sheds light
on the early development of astronomy and cosmology.
In this book, we present the cosmology of the Bhagavata Purana
or Srimad-Bhagavatam, one of the eighteen principal Puranas. We
supplement this with references to other Puranas, to the Indian epics
(the Mahdbhdrata and Rdmayana), and to the texts on mathematical
astronomy called Jyotisa Sastras.
The Visnu Purana is one of the eighteen principal Puranas. Its
cosmology is essentially the same as that of the Bhagavatam, and
we draw upon it for clarification and additional information. The
Mahdbhdrata is an epic of some 100,000 verses that is said to be an
7



8 1. Introduction to Texts
encyclopedia of traditional Indian lore, and it also sheds light on
Bhagavata cosmology.
The Jyotisa Sastras are medieval Indian astronomy texts which
contain instructions for calculating planetary motions and solar and
lunar eclipses. They present astronomy in a different way than the
Puranas, but they nonetheless have much in common with them. We
will refer to the Jyotisa Sastra known as Surya-siddhanta to supplement
our presentation of the astronomy of the Bhagavatam.
1.1 PURANAS
The Sanskrit texts called Puranas are compendiums of Indian
mythology, theology, and traditional lore. They are generally consid¬
ered to have been compiled within the current era, but they may
contain material that is much older. The Puranas present a compre¬
hensive world view which attempts to place humanity in a meaningful
position in relation to the universe. Thus they provide a window
through which we can observe an ancient way of seeing the world.
The major Puranas traditionally deal with ten topics, including the
creation and annihilation of the universe, the history of humans and
demigods, cosmology, and the relation between the soul and God. The
eighteen Mahapuranas (Great Puranas) are said to contain 400,000
verses in total. In addition there are eighteen Upapuranas and a
number of other works claiming Puranic status.
In India, the traditional view is that the Puranas complement the
Vedas—the ancient texts seen as the ultimate authority in Hindu soci¬
ety. Some of the Puranas themselves declare that they and Sanskrit
historical epics (such as Mahabharata) are the fifth Veda. For example,
the Bhagavatam makes this claim in verse 1.4.20.
The Vedas are still dated by scholars according to the scheme
shown in Table 1.1, which dates back to the pioneering nineteenth
century Indologist Max Muller (O’Flaherty, 1975, pp. 17-18).
The most important epics are the Mahabharata, dated from around
300 B.C. to A.D. 300, and the Ramayana, dated from 200 B.C. to A.D.
200. Scholars generally assign the Puranas to the period from about
A.D. 250 up to A.D. 1500.
The Indologist Ludo Rocher proposed that the Puranas served as
companions to the Vedas, and he used this to push back the period

of their composition. He argued that “Another natural conclusion
derived from the belief that the Puranas were necessary companions
to the Vedas, is that this companion literature was essential and, there¬
fore, in existence from Vedic times onward” (Rocher, 1986, p. 16). This
is consistent with the Puranas’ account of their own origin, which
maintains that they were written down when the sage Vyasadeva
divided the Vedas and committed them to written form.
This would put the Puranas back to 1200 B.C., using Muller’s
chronology. The apparent contradiction can be resolved by observing
that many Puranas have evidently been revised within the last 2,000
years. However, the Puranas as a genre may date back long before this.
According to Wendy O’Flaherty, “since the Epics and Puranas repre¬
sent an oral tradition that was constantly revised over a period of
several thousand years, a passage actually composed in the twelfth
century A.D. may represent a surprisingly accurate preservation of a
myth handed down since the twelfth century B.C.—or a completely
original retelling of that myth” (O’Flaherty, 1975, p. 16). Which of
these alternatives holds true has to be judged for each Parana, and
each Puranic story, on an individual basis.
The Puranic tradition in India maintains that the division of the
Vedas by Vyasadeva dates back to just before the advent of the Kali
yuga, the age of quarrel and degradation. Since at least the fifth century
A.D., traditional Hindus have dated the beginning of Kali-yuga back to
about 3102 B.C. Thus the famous Indian astronomer Aryabhata said
that sixty times sixty years of Kali-yuga had elapsed on his twenty-third
birthday, which fell in A.D. 499 (Dikshit, 1969b, p. 55). The Kali-yuga



10 1. Introduction to Texts
date of 3102 B.C. is connected with astronomy, and some scholars
maintain that it was defined by astronomical back-calculations at some
point within the current era. The story of this date involves many
interesting details in the history of astronomy, and we discuss it in
Chapter 8.
1.2 BHAGAVATA PURANA
The Bhagavata Purana (Srimad-Bhagavatam or, briefly, Bhaga
vatam) is one of the most popular scriptures of the Vaisnavas or
worshipers of Visnu and Krsna. According to the Bhagavatam itself,
After Lord Krsna departed for His abode along with religious prin¬
ciples and transcendental knowledge, this Purana, Srimad-Bhagavatam,
has arisen like the sun in this age of Kali to enlighten those who have no
spiritual vision (Bhagavatam 1.3.43).
Unlike a number of the Puranas, the Bhagavatam is a unified com¬
position, and this has led some scholars to allege that it was a forgery
perhaps perpetrated by a thirteenth-century grammarian named Vopa
deva. However, even though Vopadeva wrote two works based on the
Bhagavatam, his authorship of the original text has been generally
rejected (Rocher, 1986, p. 145).
The Indologist Ludo Rocher observed that, apart from a few
voices alleging fraud, “the Bhagavata Purana has been acclaimed as
the most popular of all puranas. It is also the most famous purana,
which has influenced Indian thought and religion more strongly than
any other composition of this genre” (Rocher, 1986, p. 148).
The Bhagavatam is noted for being written in difficult and archaic
Sanskrit. Some have taken this as evidence of great age, while others
see it as evidence of an effort to create the impression of great age. It
is interesting that many archaisms in the Bhagavatam cannot be readily
traced back to known literary sources. Thus a study by F. J. Meier
concluded that “alongside a few archaisms for which the Vedic context
is either indicated or suggested, there are many more the origin of
which can no longer be traced” (Rocher, 1986, p. 146).
Scholars have been unable to reach a clear consensus regarding
the date of the Bhagavatam. Here is a list of scholarly dates for this text
compiled by Rocher (Rocher, 1986, pp. 147-48):

A.D.1000 Dasgupta
A.D. 1200-1300 Colebrooke, Wilson, Burnouf,
Lassen, Macdonell, etc.
To this we may add that Hardy dates the Bhagavatam to the
ninth or early tenth century (Hardy, 1983, p. 488), and Hudson argues
that at least part of the material in the Bhagavatam was present
all over India from at least the third century B.C. (Hudson, 1995,
p. 172). Hudson suggests that the archaic language in the Bhagavatam
may reflect an authentic tradition dating back to c. 400 B.C. In this
study, Chapter 8 presents astronomical evidence bearing on the date
of the Bhagavatam.
We will have occasion to refer to several commentaries on the
Bhagavatam. The most famous of these is the Bhdvartha-dipika
by Sridhara Swami (c. A.D. 1350-1450). We will also refer to the



12 1. Introduction to Texts
commentaries by Visvanatha Cakravarti and Vamsidhara, who wrote
in the sixteenth century, as well as to the commentaries of Viraraghava
and Vijayadhvaja Tirtha.
Our original source of information on the Bhagavatam was the
English translation of this work written by Srila A. C. Bhaktivedanta
Swami Prabhupada (Bhaktivedanta, 1982). His translation used an
explanatory approach incorporating the commentaries of several
Vaisnava commentators, including those mentioned above. In some
cases, we will refer to retranslations of these verses by Dr. Howard
Resnick, who presented their literal meaning by removing material
from commentaries that had been included in the original translations.
1.3 VISNU PURANA
The Visnu Purana is one of the eighteen Mahapuranas. It is
particularly useful for the purposes of this study because it contains an
extensive section on cosmology which complements the cosmological
section of the Bhagavatam.
The date of the Visnu Purana, like that of Puranas in general, is
uncertain. Here is a list of scholarly dates for this text compiled by
Ludo Rocher (Rocher, 1986, p. 249):

1.4 JYOTISA SASTRAS
The Jyotisa Sastras are Sanskrit texts expounding native Indian
astronomy. These texts present parameters and computational rules
for predicting planetary positions and other astronomical phenomena.
They may also include cosmological and geographical material, but
this tends to be different in character from the cosmology and geogra¬
phy of the Purdnas. The Purdnas generally do not explicitly mention
the earth as a globe, and they describe an earth-disk (Bhu-mandala)
that is billions of miles in diameter. In contrast, when the Jyotisa Sds
tras mention the earth, they treat it explicitly as a globe of realistic
dimensions.
The earliest Jyotisa Sastra is the Jyotisavedanga, which gives sim¬
ple calculations for the motions of the sun and moon relative to the
naksatras (lunar mansions) and to each other. (See Appendix 1 for
information on the naksatras.) Later Jyotisa texts describe the geocen¬
tric orbits of the nine grahas. These are the sun, the moon, the five
planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn), and the pseudo¬
planets Rahu and Ketu. The motions of the five planets are calculated
using an epicycle system reminiscent of Ptolemy, and rules are given
for calculating the timing of eclipses of the sun and the moon.
Modern scholars generally view Indian astronomy in terms of
foreign influences they see as paramount in its development. The
following table by David Pingree summarizes the history of Indian
astronomy as it is presently understood by scholars (Pingree, 1981,
p. 9). It divides this history into five periods that, except for the first,
are named after sources of foreign input:
1. Vedic (ca. 1000 b.c.-400 b.c.), characterized by elementary
calendaric concepts with rudimentary mathematical
development.
2. Babylonian (ca. 400 b.c-200 a.d.)
3. Greco-Babylonian (ca. 200-400)
4. Greek (ca. 400-1600)
5. Islamic (ca. 1600-1800)



14 1. Introduction to Texts
As always in Indology, these dates should be regarded as tentative.
The Jyotisavedanga is the most important work showing purely
Babylonian affinities. It exists in two recensions, that of the Rg Veda
in thirty-six verses and that of the Yajur Veda in forty-three to forty
five verses. Pingree makes the interesting remark that the former gives
the length of the year as 366 sidereal days (or 365 civil days) (Pingree,
1981, p. 9).
The distinction between a sidereal day and a civil day is that the
first is the time for one revolution of the stars (from star rise to star rise)
and the second is the time for one revolution of the sun (from sun rise
to sun rise). It is noteworthy that this concept was understood in the
period of the Jyotisavedanga.
Pingree sees the Pahcasiddhantikd of Varahamihira (sixth century
A.D.) as the prime example of an early form of Hellenistic astronomy
that also displays strong Babylonian influence. He grants, however,
that “no extant Greek texts can be pointed to as sources” for some of
the non-Babylonian material in this work (Pingree, 1981, p. 11).
The period of Greek influence is marked by the introduction of
epicyclic models for the motion of the planets. The epicyclic models
place the earth globe in the center, surrounded by the planetary orbits.
These models are similar to those of the second-century Alexandrian
astronomer Claudius Ptolemy, but they also have their own distinct
features that cannot be derived directly from Ptolemy’s work. It is hard
to say how much they owe to Greek ideas and how much they derived
from independent invention in India.
Epicyclic planetary orbits are presented in a class of works called
Siddhdntas. The earliest appears to be the Paitamahasiddhanta, which
is found as a part of the Visnudharmottarapurdna.
An important work of the Siddhanta class is the Aryabhatlya of
Aryabhata, who was twenty-three years old in A.D. 499. This work is
famous for its statement that the earth rotates daily on its axis-—a point
that was severely criticized by later Indian astronomers, such as
Varahamihira and Bhaskaracarya.
Another important work in this class is the Surya-siddhanta, which
became one of the most popular astronomy texts in India. It represents
Indian astronomy in its mature state and is usually dated to about the
tenth century A.D.



1.5 Surya-siddhanta 15
1.5 SURYA-SIDDHANTA
According to the early eleventh-century author Alberuni, the
Surya-siddhanta (or some work of the same name) was composed by
Lata (Sachau, 1910, p. 153). According to the text itself, it was spoken
by an emissary of the sun-god to the Asura (demon) named Maya at
the end of Krta-yuga, over two million years ago.
In his translation of the Surya-siddhanta, Ebenezer Burgess notes
that some manuscripts seem to connect Maya with the Roman Empire.
In the manuscripts without commentary, the sun-god is presented as
saying to Maya, “Go therefore to Romaka-city, thine own residence;
there, undergoing incarnation as a barbarian, owing to the curse of
Brahma, I will impart to thee this science” (Burgess, 1860, p. 3). If
Romaka is actually Rome (or a Roman city), this could be interpreted
as evidence that the Surya-siddhanta was derived from Greco-Roman
astronomy. Of course, it might also be seen as evidence of tampering
with the text.
The Surya-siddhanta in its present form can be dated firmly as far
back as the fifteenth century A.D. There exists a fifteenth-century palm
leaf manuscript (No. XXI, N. 8 of the Adyar Library, Madras) of the
text of the Surya-siddhanta along with a commentary by Paramesvara
(Shukla, 1957, p. 1). We will have occasion to refer to this manuscript
in Appendix 8, where we argue that remnants of advanced astronomi¬
cal knowledge may survive in the Surya-siddhanta.
The astronomy of the Surya-siddhanta presents an epicyclic theory
of planetary motion similar to that of Claudius Ptolemy, but it also has
many features that may be of Indian origin. It begins with a detailed
discussion of the Indian system of world chronology known as the yuga
system. This system is based on a catur-yuga of 4,320,000 solar years
and a kalpa of one thousand catur-yugas.
In the Surya-siddhanta, these immense periods of time are used as
a convenient device for presenting the orbits of the planets. The orbits
are described by a series of cycles and epicycles that are combined
trigonometrically to reproduce observed planetary motions. Each
cyclic period is defined by giving its number of revolutions in a kalpa.
Since this is given as a whole number, it follows that all planetary
motions will return exactly to their starting point in one kalpa. A



16 1. Introduction to Texts
similar idea is found in the “great year” of Hellenistic astronomy, and
the idea of cyclic time is also prominent in the Indian Puranas and in
the Mahabharata.
The Surya-siddhanta describes the periodic motions of the sun,
moon, and planets with good accuracy. It also gives the earth-moon
distance to within about 11% of the modern value. However, its figures
for the distances of the sun and planets are unrealistically small. They
are calculated on the assumption that the sun, moon, and planets all
move with the same (mean) speed in their orbits, and therefore orbital
radii are proportional to orbital periods.
In contrast, Kepler’s third law makes the radius proportional to the
2/3 power of the period. For the planets, the proportionality constant
in Kepler’s law is also much larger than the one used in Surya-siddhan
ta, which is based on the orbit of the moon.
It is noteworthy that Ptolemy also made the planetary orbits much
too small, but he used a different approach. Each geocentric orbit
ranges from its perigee (point closest to the earth) to its apogee
(furthest point). His idea was that the apogee of each orbit must equal
the perigee of the next one out, so that there would be no unused space
(see Appendix 4). The result is that the orbit of Saturn is smaller than
the earth’s orbit as we know it today.
In the Surya-siddhanta, the motion of the planets is said to be
controlled by cords of air. The text explains that
Forms of Time, of invisible shape, stationed in the zodiac (bhagana),
called the conjunction (slghrocca), apsis (mandocca), and node {pdta),
are the causes of the motion of the planets. The planets, attached to these
beings by cords of air, are drawn away by them, with the right and left
hand, forward or backward, according to nearness, toward their own
place. A wind, moreover, called provector (pravaha) impels them toward
their own apices (ucca); being drawn away forward and backward, they
proceed by a varying motion (Burgess, 1860, p. 53).
It is interesting to compare this with the cosmology of the Puranas,
where we find similar ideas. In the Bhdgavata Purana, the rotation of
the stars and planets around the polar axis is said to be caused by the
daksindvarta wind. This is called the pravaha wind in the Visnu Purana,
where a more detailed account is given of the control of planetary
motions by cords of air:



1.5 Surya-siddhanta 17
I have thus described to you, Maitreya, the chariots of the nine planets,
all which are fastened to Dhruva by aerial cords. The orbs of all the
planets, asterisms, and stars are attached to Dhruva, and travel accord¬
ingly in their proper orbits, being kept in their places by their respective
bands of air (Wilson, 1980, p. 346).
Chapters 4-6 of the Surya-siddhanta present rules for calculating
the times of solar and lunar eclipses. These are based on the same
theory of eclipses used in modern astronomy. However, the ascending
node of the moon is identified as Rahu, the eclipse demon of the
Puranas (see Section 3.4.1). Rahu’s counterpart, Ketu, is not men¬
tioned (Burgess, 1860, p. 56).
The Surya-siddhanta contains a chapter on cosmology and geog¬
raphy, in which the earth is portrayed as a self-supporting globe float¬
ing in space and surrounded by the planetary orbits. The Puranic
Mount Meru is defined as a literal polar axis, passing through the poles,
with dwellings of the gods at the northern end and dwellings of the
demons at the southern end. In the four quarters, extending south from
the north pole to the equator, are four continents with four equatorial
cities, as follows (Burgess, 1860, p. 286).
TABLE 1.4
Jambudvlpa in Surya-siddhanta
Direction Continent City
east Bhadrasva Yamakoti

These can be compared with the continents (varsas) of the Puranic
Jambudvlpa (see also Section 2.4.1). The general view of scholars is
that the flat Jambudvlpa was adapted to the earth globe when Greek
astronomy was introduced into India. However, we argue in this work
that Jambudvlpa of the Puranas was understood as a planisphere
model of the earth when the Puranic texts were written. Thus the idea



18 1. Introduction to Texts
of an earth globe was originally there in the Puranic Jambudvlpa.
Whether or not this idea was imported from the Greeks is hard to say.
The accepted dates for the surviving recensions of the Puranas would
allow this, and Ptolemy is known to have authored a work on the
planisphere projection, mapping a globe onto a plane.

Of Bho-mandala

2.1 OVERVIEW OF BHU-MANDALA
The main focus of Bhagavata cosmology is on Bhu-mandala—the
“circle of the earth”—and we will therefore begin by giving an over¬
view of its qualitative and quantitative features. The structure of Bhu
mandala turns out to be primarily astronomical in nature, and we will
discuss this in detail in later chapters. At the same time, its qualitative
features refer both to earthly geography and to the world of demigods.
Some of the qualitative details appear to be derived from a historical
background that begins with the descriptive geography of India and
adjoining parts of Asia. In this chapter we will look briefly at this
history, but since it is difficult to reconstruct, our main emphasis
throughout this book will be on the cosmology of the Bhagavatam as
it stands in its present form.
Bhu-mandala is a disk that bisects the sphere of the Brahmanda,
the Puranic universe, and it has the same diameter as this sphere.
The most noteworthy feature of Bhu-mandala is that it is described in
the Bhagavatam and other Puranas in geographical terms. The central
region of Bhu-mandala is divided into seven annular or ring-shaped
“islands” and “oceans” which alternate, forming a bull’s eye pattern.
Here the Sanskrit word for island is dvipa, which literally means two
waters. This term is appropriate, since most of the dvipas are rings with
an ocean on the inside and on the outside.
The seven dvipas and oceans are collectively called Sapta-dvipa,
and they are surrounded by three larger ring-shaped regions which
extend out to the edge of Bhu-mandala. Since they are presented as
parts of the earth, many scholars have attempted to identify the seven
dvipas with earthly regions or countries. Thus Colonel Wilford, an

2.1 Overview of Bhu-mandala 21
early Indologist, interpreted the dvipas as seven “climates,” or zones
of latitude, and he assigned specific countries to them, more or less by
imagination (Wilson, 1980, p. 292).
M. P. Tripathi and D. C. Sircar identify Sakadvlpa as the land of
the Sakas—the Greek Scythia—corresponding to Sakasthana (Seis
tan in East Iran) and areas to the north of this region. Sircar identifies
Kusadvlpa with the ancient land of Kush, which he thinks is Ethiopia
(Sircar, 1960, pp. 163-64). But Tripathi disagrees and identifies
Kusadvlpa with the land of the Kushans, powerful people from Cen¬
tral Asia who invaded northern India in the early centuries of our era
(Tripathi, 1969, p. 181).
It is possible that the dvipas originally did refer to regions of this
earth, but in the existing Purdnas they are defined as gigantic circles
that do not at all correspond to irregular earthly land masses. We will
argue that these structures play an essentially astronomical role in
Puranic cosmology, although Wilford’s climate theory is not com¬
pletely off the mark.
The features of Bhu-mandala are all defined quantitatively using
a unit, called the yojana, which is about eight miles in length. The
innermost island of Bhu-mandala is Jambudvipa, which has the form
of a disk 100,000 yojanas in diameter. Jambudvipa is surrounded by
the salt water ocean (Lavanoda), which is a ring 100,000yojanas across
from its inner to its outer edge. This ocean, in turn, is surrounded by
the ring-shaped island of Plaksadvipa, which is 200,000 yojanas across.
The successive islands and oceans enlarge in as indicated in Table 2.1
(with distances expressed in thousands of yojanas).
In this table, thickness is the distance from the inner radius of a
ring-shaped feature to its outer radius. The seven islands and oceans
follow the rule that the thickness of an ocean equals the thickness of
the island it surrounds and the thickness of that island is twice the
thickness of the ocean it surrounds. The circular Jambudvipa is an
exception. It surrounds no ocean, and its thickness is its diameter.
The doubling of thicknesses is belied by Figure 2.1, where we
show the seven oceans and islands as equal bands. We do this
because the oceans and islands do not fit easily in one picture if the
doubling rule is followed. For this reason, most traditional diagrams
of Bhu-mandala show equal bands.

18 250,000 125,000 Region Aloka-varsa
Feature 13, called Manasottara Mountain, is a circular mountain
range, reminiscent of some of the large craters on the moon. Since
it cuts Puskaradvlpa in half (see 5.20.30), we listed it in the table as
“V2 Island & mtn.” Manasottara Mountain links Bhu-mandala with the
orbit of the sun. The axle of the sun’s chariot is said to to rest at one end
on Mount Meru in the center of Bhu-mandala. On the other end, it is
supported by a wheel that rolls continuously on the circular track of
Manasottara Mountain. As we will see, this solar chariot plays a key
role in the astronomical interpretation of Bhu-mandala.
The Inhabited Region (Loka) is an exception to the rule of dou¬
bling that applies to Sapta-dvlpa. Its width is defined in the Bhagavatam
verse 5.20.35 to be equal to the radius of Manasottara Mountain, and
this is somewhat more than twice the thickness of Svadudaka, the ring
that it immediately surrounds. The next ring, called the Golden Land

(Kancanibhumi), is assigned a thickness that brings its outer radius to
exactly half the radius of Bhu-mandala. This is a bit over twice the
radius of Loka. Thus the table of distances is generated (roughly) by
doubling, but this doubling is carried out in different ways in different
parts of the table.
We note that “Loka” means an inhabited area. In contrast, the
Bhagavatam states that the Golden Land is uninhabited. The fif¬
teenth-century commentator, Sridhara Swami, clarifies the dimen¬
sions of these two regions as follows. He says that the distance from
Manasottara to Meru equals the width of the inhabited earth beyond
Svadudaka, and it is IVi koti and IVi lakhs (15,750,000) of yojanas.
Beyond this is another, golden land measuring eight koti and thirty
nine lakhs (83,900,000) of yojanas. This reading gives the figures listed
in our table. (Here/co// and lakh are commonly used terms in Sanskrit
designating ten million and one hundred thousand, respectively.)
There is one other circular mountain in addition to Manasottara.
This is Lokaloka Mountain, with a radius of 125,000 thousand yojanas
(see 5.20.38). This circle divides the illuminated region of Bhu
mandala from the dark, uninhabited region, called Aloka-varsa,
which extends from Lokaloka to the shell of the Brahmanda.

2.2 THE NOMENCLATURE OF SEVEN DVIPAS
In addition to their bare dimensions, the dvipas are vividly
described as populated geographical regions. With one exception,
each dvipa is named after a prominent plant said to grow there. The
“oceans” are named after various liquids, such as salt water, sugar¬
cane juice, and liquor. The inhabitants of the dvipas are described,
and they are said to worship the Supreme God in the form of various
demigods. This information is summed up in the following table. In the
third column, the terms fire, water, and air refer to the demigods
presiding over these elements.

The five dvipas from Plaksadvipa to Sakadvipa follow a simple
pattern, and each is described in a few lines in the Bhagavatam. Each
of these dvipas is divided into seven regions called varsas, with seven
mountains and seven rivers. Each varsa is ruled by a grandson of
Maharaja Priyavrata, a famous personality who is said to have
created a second sun by following 180° behind the sun on a brilliantly
glowing chariot. The oceans are said to have been ruts created by his
chariot wheels.
According to the table, Kusadvlpa is named after a kind of grass.
It is noteworthy that a person performing a Vedic fire sacrifice will
traditionally sit on a mat made of kusa grass and offer ghee into the
fire. Therefore it may be no coincidence that fire is worshiped in
Kusadvlpa, which is surrounded by the Ghee Ocean.

2.2 The Nomenclature of Seven Dvipas 25
In addition to its geography, founding kings, and peoples, each of
the dvipas surrounding Jambudvlpa is described as having a particu¬
lar, unusual feature. These are listed as follows:

These picturesque accounts of the islands and oceans of Bhu
mandala have sometimes invoked ridicule, as when Lord Macaulay
disparaged seas of treacle in his “Minute on Indian Education” (Mac¬
aulay, 1952, p. 723). Certainly, this is not geography in the familiar
European sense of the term. Elowever, as we will see later on, the

26 2. The Islands and Oceans of Bhu-mandala
geography of Bhu-mandala encodes a combination of astronomical
and geographical maps which is both rational and scientific. It appears
that the elements of Bhu-mandala geography have either been
introduced or adapted to convey a number of meaningful messages,
some of which may still remain obscure. This process may be linked
to the historical development of Puranic cosmology, and we now turn
to this topic.
2.3 HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT
OF BHU-MANDALA FEATURES
If we survey traditional Sanskrit cosmological texts, we find a
number of variations in the nomenclature and layout of the geography
of Bhu-mandala. Followers of the Puranas traditionally say that such
variations pertain to different kalpas, or periods of creation, but
modern scholars tend to see them in historical terms. In this section,
we will carry out a comparative study of texts to see what we can learn
about the historical development of cosmological ideas.1
Our main conclusion from the study is that the cosmology of the
Bhagavatam is unified and well organized, in contrast to many other
Puranas (and related texts) that present cosmology in an incomplete
or inconsistent way. We seem to see a historical process of imperfect
preservation, rather than one of creative development. Unfortunately,
the creative phase of Puranic cosmology largely remains hidden, at
least as far this study is concerned.
The Puranas largely agree on the names applied to the features of
Bhu-mandala, but they may permute them, and some Puranas omit
features present in others. Table 2.4 summarizes the situation found in
eleven readily available Puranas, in the Mahabharata, and in the Jyo
tisa text, Siddhanta-siromani. In this table, the feature numbers from
Table 2.1 (p. 22) are used to indicate the sequence of Bhu-mandala

Several observations can be made here. First of all, the Siddhanta
siromani, the Matsya and Varaha Puranas, and the Mahabharata differ
as a group from the other Puranas in the table. In the first three of
these texts, Plaksadvlpa (3) is replaced by Gomedadvlpa (3') and
switched with Sakadvipa (11).
In the Mahabharata, Plaksadvlpa is missing, even though San
jaya, the narrator, says he will describe seven islands (Ganguli, vol. V,
p. 24). Only six islands are mentioned (respectively 1, 11, 7, 5, 9, 14),
as well as five oceans (respectively 2, 8, 12, 6, 15). The relationship
between the islands and oceans is not indicated, and we have
therefore arranged them in the table (preserving order) so as to line
up as much as possible with the Matsya Purana. The good matches
indicate a strong relationship between the arrangement given in the



28 2. The Islands and Oceans of Bhu-mandala
Mahabharata and the one given in this Purana.
In the Puranas, the seven dvipas and oceans of Bhu-mandala are
alternating concentric rings, and their sizes are generally given by the
doubling rule of Table 2.1 (p. 22). But in the Mahabharata, it is not
clear that dvipas are intended to be concentric rings. Dvipas are said
to be surrounded by oceans, but oceans are not said to be surrounded
by dvipas. The dvipas in the Mahabharata are said to double as one
goes north, but no mention is made of their extent in other directions.
Doubling is applied even more extensively in the Mahabharata than
in the Puranas, since various mountains are also said to double in size
as one goes north (Ganguli, vol. V, pp. 26-27).
Since the Mahabharata is generally dated before the Puranas, one
might suppose that its cosmography is ancestral to Puranic cosmo¬
graphy. This is possible. But the cosmography of the Mahabharata is
incomplete and unsystematic, and if it does represent an ancestral
system, it presents only a fragment of that system—whatever it may
have been.
This naturally leads to the thought that the text of the Mahabharata
has become corrupt, and this idea is not new. For example, in his
Mahabhdratatatparyanirnaya, verses 2.3-4, the thirteenth-century
philosopher and religious teacher, Madhvacarya, stated that
In some places (of the Mahabharata) verses have been interpolated
and in others verses have been omitted. In some places, the verses have
been transposed and in others, different readings have been given out
of ignorance or otherwise.
Though the works are really indestructible, they must be deemed to
be mostly altered. Mostly all of them have disappeared and not even one
crore [ten million] (out of several crores of slokas) now exists (Resnick,
1999).
Many Puranas also present cosmography in an inconsistent fash¬
ion. For example, the Varaha Purana mentions duplicate names for
three of the oceans. (These are indicated by stacking one alternative
above the other in the table.) The Padma Purana contains a nearly
verbatim copy of cosmological material from the Mahabharata—with
the interlocutors Sanjaya and Dhrtarastra being replaced by the Pura¬
nic narrator, Suta, and a group of sages. But in another place, it gives
a different list following the pattern of the Bhagavatam. Thus the



2.3 Historical Development of Bhu-mandala Features 29
Figure 2.5 Approximate cosmographical map, based on the account in the Rama¬
yana of the travels of the Vanaras (monkeys) in search of Sita (after Ali, 1966, p. 23).
Padma Purana contains a mixture of material from different works.
The Ramayana does not mention doubling, and its earth, bounded
by dark, inaccessible regions, does not seem to have a succession of
alternating oceans and islands. The center is India, and Mount Meru
is placed to the west rather than to the north. On the east there is an
island of Yava, which might be Java. There is also a Milk Ocean
(Kslroda) and a fresh water sea (Jalada). The Salmali tree of Garuda
is located in the east, and the Kraunca mountain is placed in the
Himalayas to the north. Apart from this, there is little to remind us
of the Puranic Bhu-mandala.
Although the Ramayana may seem to represent an earlier stage
in the development of the cosmology, there are earlier references to
oceans and land areas that surround one another and double in size
from one to the next. For example, the Brhad-aranyaka Upanisad
states that “This world is thirty-two times the space crossed by the
sun’s chariot in a day. The earth twice as that, surrounds it. Surround¬
ing that earth is the ocean twice as large. Then, in between, there is the
space as fine as a razor’s edge, or as subtle as the wing of a fly” (Siva
nanda, 1985, p. 294). The Upanisads are generally thought to be much
earlier than the Ramayana, but this description is reminiscent of the

diagram described by Yajna
valkya in the Brhad-aranyaka
Upanisad 3.3.2. Note: the sun’s

the middle of the globe.
Puranas, which are held to be later. The reference to the sun’s motion
suggests that the “earth” and the “ocean” must be extremely large,
and this is also seen in the Puranas. The “space as fine as a razor’s edge”
has been described as a minute opening between the two hemispheri¬
cal shells of the Brahmanda through which souls may pass.
The first nine Puranas agree on feature names and their order,
but some of them list fewer features than others. These Puranas all
seem to reflect a single system different from the one in the Matsya
Purana. The Bhagavatam, followed by the Visnu Parana, gives the
most detailed list of ring-structures in Bhu-mandala. At the same time,
some Puranas, such as the Vdyu, give much more detailed accounts
of the geography of Jambudvipa than the Bhagavatam.
We may ask whether the Puranas with longer lists added some
features, or whether the ones with shorter lists dropped some. Our
impression on reading the texts is that in many cases, the Puranas refer
to the geography of Bhu-mandala in a very cursory way, as though the
reader was expected to be already familiar with it. Thus some Puranas
neglect to mention all of the feature names.
Since the Bhagavatam differs from all of the other Puranas in its
assignment of the Milk (10) and Curd (12) Oceans (Table 2.1, p. 22),
it appears that these have been switched for some reason in the Bhd
gavatam. Likewise, feature 16 (Loka) is listed only in the Bhagavatam,
and we can ask whether it is unique to this text. The answer is that



2.3 Historical Development of Bhu-mandala Features 31
indirect evidence suggests that the Bhdgavatam’s calculations for
Loka and the Golden Land were used in other texts as well.
Thus the Bhdgavatam makes the radius of Lokaloka one fourth
the diameter of the Brahmanda, and the distance from the Sweet
Water Ocean to Lokaloka Mountain comes to about ten crores of
yojanas, where a crore is ten million. (The exact figure is 99,650,000
yojanas.) H. H. Wilson finds similar figures in the Siva Tantra. He says,
‘'According to the Siva Tantra, the golden land is ten crores of
Yojanas, making, with the seven continents, one fourth of the whole
measurement'’ (Wilson, 1980, p. 294). Thus the Bhdgavatam’s calcu¬
lations—which make use of feature 16—appear to be reflected in the
Siva Tantra, and they may have a further, unknown background.
In contrast, the Visnu and Kurma Purdnas (which are closest to
the Bhdgavatam in Table 2.4) both say that the Golden Land has twice
the thickness of the Sweet Water Ocean (Svadudaka). This results in
a radius of 38,150,000 yojanas for Lokaloka Mountain. All of the
Purdnas agree that the Brahmanda is 250,000,000 yojanas in radius,
and so the radius of Lokaloka Mountain comes to about 15% of the
universal radius.
It is not clear whether this version came before that of the Bhdga¬
vatam or after it. But if we assume the former, it is hard to say why the
boundary of the Brahmanda was placed so far away from Lokaloka
Mountain. The Visnu Purdna cannot produce a figure as large as the
universal radius by further doubling. For example, doubling thickness
again by adding twice the Golden Land would bring one out to only
63,750,000 yojanas. In contrast, the Bhdgavatam does generate the
universal radius by doubling, and this involves feature 16.
In summary, it does not seem possible at present to trace the
geography of Bhu-mandala back to its origins. The existing texts do
not explain their calculations, and many of them appear to be corrupt
and incomplete. At some point, descriptive geography (perhaps
represented by the Rdmayana) must have given way to a quasi
geographical system based on circles of immense size. As we will
argue later on, the motivation for this was apparently astronomical
and involved an analogy between the earth and the sun's path through
the heavens. It could have happened at any time in the development
of the tradition leading up to the Bhdgavatam.



32 2. The Islands and Oceans of Bhu-mandala

outside of Sapta-dvipa, with a

a radius only 15% of the radius of
the Brahmanda, as shown here.

version in Figure 1 (p. 2) of the
Introduction.)
2.4 THE ISLAND OF JAMBUDVIPA
In the Puranas, Jambudvipa is a disk 100,000 yojanas in diameter
situated in the center of Bhu-mandala. In the center of Jambudvipa
is Mount Meru (or Sumeru) which, in one interpretation, corresponds
astronomically to the polar axis of the earth. But even though the
center point of Meru may represent the north pole, the cardinal
directions east, west, north, and south are defined from it. We will
argue later on that Jambudvipa also represents a local map centered
on the Pamir mountains, and these cardinal directions are appropriate
for this map (see Section 5.1).
On the top of Mount Meru, the cardinal directions and interme¬
diate directions (northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest) are
marked by the eight cities of the Loka-palas, surrounding the central
city of Brahma. It turns out that this arrangement of directional
demigods is related to a system of Indian architecture in which a
building site on the earth is identified with the ecliptic—the path of
the sun through the heavens. This is discussed below, in Section 2.5.
It is significant, because a key interpretation of the earth-mandala is
that it represents the ecliptic and the planetary orbits.
The disk of Jambudvipa is divided in the Puranas into nine varsas,
or continents, by a series of mountain ranges, as shown in Figure 2.9.
The disk is first of all divided into seven horizontal strips by six ranges
that run east-west. In the Bhagavatam, each range is said to be



2.4 The Island of Jambudvlpa 33
10,000 yojanas high and 2,000 yojanas wide. The three strips to the
north and the three to the south are single varsas, and they are said to
extend for 9,000 yojanas in a north-south direction. This leaves 34,000
yojanas for the seventh strip, which consists of three varsas. These
features and their north-south dimensions are listed in Table 2.5,
going from north to south.

According to 5.16.8, the east-west length of these mountains is
supposed to be reduced by a little more than 10% as one goes from
mountain to mountain from the center outward. This is roughly true
if we extend each mountain range until it meets the circular boundary
of Jambudvipa. These lengths appear in Table 2.6.
The central strip is divided into three varsas (making nine in total)
by two mountain chains that run north-south and extend for 2,000
yojanas. Their north-south length must be 34,000 yojanas. Taking
their width in the east-west direction to be 2,000 yojanas, and taking
Ilavrta-varsa in the center to be square, the east-west dimensions of
these features are in Table 2.7.
The inhabitants and topography of Jambudvipa are described in
considerable detail. In 5.17.11, Bharata-varsa is singled out as the
field of fruitive activities, and the other eight varsas are said to be
meant for elevated persons who are enjoying the remainder of their

pious credits after returning from the heavenly planets. This suggests
that, in one sense, Bharata-varsa is the entire earth and the other eight
varsas represent otherworldly, heavenly regions. This is one of the
major interpretations of Jambudvlpa and Bhu-mandala, and it is
discussed in Chapter 6.
Within Ilavrta-varsa there are a number of mountains and rivers
surrounding Mount Meru. Meru is described in 5.16.7 as being 100,000
yojanas high, with 16,000 yojanas extending beneath the earth and
84,000 yojanas above the earth. It is said to be 32,000 yojanas in
diameter at the top and 16,000 yojanas in diameter at the base.

Mount Meru is therefore in the form of an inverted cone, and it
is compared to the pericarp or seed pod of the lotus flower of Bhu
mandala. In the Vayu Purdna, Meru is said to be four-sided, with the
colors white (east), yellow (south), black (west), and red (north) (Ta
gare, 1987, pp. 237-38).



2.4 The Island of Jambudvipa 37
In each varsa it is said that an avatara of Visnu is worshiped by a
particular famous devotee. In this way, Jambudvipa also plays the role
of a divine mandala representing the faith of the Vaisnavas, for whom
the Bhdgavatam is an important sacred text. The avatdras and their
worshipers are listed in Table 2.8.
In Bharata-varsa, Nara-narayana is said to be worshiped by Nara
da Muni in Badarikasrama, a famous site of pilgrimage for thousands
of Hindus. This provides a link with a known location in the Hima¬
layas, but we do not have earthly counterparts for the other centers of
worship.
2.4.1 Jambudvipa in the Mahabharata
The Bhlsma Parva of the Mahabharata describes a circular island
called Sudarsana which is very similar to the Puranic Jambudvipa.
The geographical layout of this island is the same as that in Tables
2.5 and 2.7, with the exception that the vertical spacing between the
east-west ranges is set at 1,000 yojanas (Ganguli, vol. V, pp. 13-14).
However, the height of Mount Meru, situated between the Malyavan
and Gandhamadana mountains, is defined to be 84,000 yojanas, as in
the Puranas.

corresponds to Jambu¬
dvipa in the Puranas.



38 2. The Islands and Oceans of Bhu-mandala
While Sudarsana corresponds to the Puranic Jambudvipa, the
term Jambudvipa is used in a different sense in the Mahabharata.
Thus, in the Bhlsma Parva it is said that “Jamvu Mountain” extends
over 18,600 yojanas and the Salt Ocean is twice as big. Sakadvipa is
twice as big as Jambudvipa, and another ocean surrounding Sakadvipa
X
is twice the size of that island (Ganguli, vol. V, p. 24). Except for the
small size of Jambudvipa, this sounds like Puranic geography as given
in the Matsya Purana.
But in the Sand Parva, it is said that King Yudhisthira once ruled
Jambudvipa, Krauncadvlpa on the west of Meru and equal to Jambu¬
dvipa, Sakadvipa on the east of Meru and equal to Krauncadvlpa, and
Bhadrasva, on the north of Meru and equal to Sakadvipa (Ganguli,
vol. VIII, p. 24). This gives us three dvlpas and one varsa arranged as
equal units around Meru in the cardinal directions. This geographical
arrangement is clearly quite different from the one given in the Bhls¬
ma Parva.
Then again, if we look back to the Bhlsma Parva, we find the
statement that “Beside Meru are situated, O lord, these four islands,
viz., Bhadraswa, and Ketumala, and Jamvudwipa otherwise called
Bharata, and Uttar-Kuru which is the abode of persons who have
achieved the merit of righteousness” (Ganguli, vol. V, p. 14). It
appears that the Mahabharata is reporting different geographical
systems without attempting to systematically reconcile them.
Figure 2.12 This diagram is based
on a text from the Santi Parva of
the Mahabharata. It differs from
the Puranas and other parts of
the Mahabharata by defining
Jambudvipa as one of four
regions surrounding Mount
Meru.



2.4 The Island ofJambudvipa 39
According to Joseph Schwartzberg, an earlier Hindu and Bud¬
dhist map of the earth placed four continents in the cardinal directions
around Mount Meru, with the continent called Bharata or Jambudvipa
to the south (Schwartzberg, 1987, p. 336). The Surya-siddhanta
follows this pattern by putting Bhadrasva to the east, Bharata to the
south, Ketumala to the west, and Kuru to the north (Burgess, 1860,
p. 286).
In Figure 2.13, published by the early Indologist Francis Wilford,
Jambudvipa is presented as a lotus, with four continents arranged
around Meru as listed in the Surya-siddhanta (Wilford, 1805). Note
that Kuru-varsa (Curu) is identified as Siberia, so that Meru falls
somewhere in the mountainous region north of India. Additional lands
near India have been added as extra petals.
Schwartzberg maintains that the original system of four conti¬
nents was modified over time until it took the form given in Figure 2.9.
This may be true, but we may also be dealing with independent
traditions making use of the same set of names for islands and
continents.
We can distinguish between the two maps of Jambudvipa on
purely functional grounds. In relation to actual earthly geography, the
Figure 2.13
Jambudvipa, depicted
as a lotus flower by
the early Indologist
Francis Wilford.



40 2. The Islands and Oceans of Bhu-mandala
four-continent map simply assigns names to lands in the four cardinal
directions around Mount Meru (which lies somewhere to the north of
India). In contrast, the map in Figure 2.9 gives a more detailed picture
of the mountain ranges and valleys in this part of south-central Asia
(see Chapter 5). This may explain how these two systems could co¬
exist in the same text.
A basic theme of this study is that models in the Bhagavatam are
sometimes used to convey more than one meaning (see the Introduc¬
tion to Bhagavata Cosmology). Here it appears that the Mahabharata
is using geographical terms (such as Sakadvlpa) with more than one
meaning. One might argue that as alternative meanings accumulated
over a long period of time, commentators became tolerant of appar¬
ently conflicting meanings, and they tended to resolve conflicts by
looking at statements from the standpoint of local context.
2.5 LORDS OF THE DIRECTIONS
Concluding this chapter, we show how an apparently minor detail
of Jambudvipa is connected with the astronomy of the ecliptic and
with rich astronomical traditions of Indochina. This connection
provides data which corroborates the close correlations between Bhu
mandala and modern astronomy that we will discuss in Chapter 4.
The Bhagavatam verse 5.21.7 describes four cities of the demigods
situated on Manasottara mountain in the cardinal directions:
TABLE 2.9
Directional Cities on Manasottara Mountain
Direction Demigod City
East Indra Devadhani
South Yama Samyamam
West Varuna Nimlocani
North Soma Vibhavari
It turns out that these cities are connected with a larger system of
directional demigods, and these in turn are connected with the
traditional Indian system of architecture known as Vastu Sastra.

Verse 5.16.29 mentions cities of eight Loka-palas, or lords of the
worlds, beginning with Indra. These cities are said to be situated on
top of Mount Sumeru, surrounding the city of Lord Brahma (Brahma
puri). The Loka-palas are also known as the Asta-dik-palaka, or eight
lords of the directions. They are situated as follows (Dubreuil-Jouveau,
1937, p. 107):

the 8x8 Vastupurusa
mandala.
Note that with the exception of Kuvera in the north, the lords of
the cardinal directions are the same as the demigods ruling the
cardinal points of Manasottara mountain.
In Vdstu Sastra, the layout of a temple or residential house is based
on an 8x8 or 9x9 grid of squares, known as the Vastupurusamandala.
This grid is associated with the figure of a person called the Vastupu¬
rusa, as indicated for the 8x8 grid in the illustration. These grids are
always aligned with the cardinal directions.
There are 28 squares in the outer border of the 8x8 grid, and 32
squares in the outer border of the 9x9 grid. These are associated with
demigods called Padadevatas. The central 3x3 squares of the 9x9 grid
are dedicated to Brahma, and thus the entire grid resembles
the top of Mount Sumeru, with Brahmapuri in the center. This is
enhanced by the close similarity between the eight Loka-palas and
the eight Padadevatas situated at the cardinal and intermediate
directions.
For the 9x9 grid, the Padadevatas are listed in the table below.
Different sources give small variants in the list of Padadevatas, and
in the first three columns we give three lists from (1) (Kramrisch, 1946,
p. 32), (2) (Tarkhedkar, 1995, p. 31), and (3) (Sthapati, 1997, p. 205).

44 2. The Islands and Oceans of Bhu-mandala
The eight Loka-palas are listed for comparison in the fourth col¬
umn of the table. The demigods are listed in groups of nine for each
side of the 9x9 square, and each corner demigod therefore comes at
the end of one list and the beginning of the next one. The corner
demigods should be compared with the Loka-palas for the interme¬
diate directions, and the demigods in the center squares of the sides
should be compared with the Loka-palas for the cardinal directions.
The similarity is close enough to indicate a strong connection between
the Vastu Sastras and the Puranic lords of the directions. Note that the
Padadevata for the center of the northern side is listed as Soma. This
disagrees with the Loka-pala list, which has Kuvera, but it agrees with
5.21.7.
There is a connection between the Vastupurusamandala and the
ecliptic. The ecliptic is the path of the sun against the background of
stars, and in Indian astronomy it is marked by 27 or 28 constellations
called naksatras. The Vastupurusamandala, which is situated on the
earth, is linked with the ecliptic in the heavens by identifying the four
cardinal directions with the solstices and equinoxes and by identifying
28 intermediate directions with the naksatras.
The Indian art historian Stella Kramrisch described this connec¬
tion as follows for the 9x9 Vastupurusamandala with 32 squares in its
border:
The 27 and 28 divisions of the Ecliptic become fixed in position like a
great, fixed, square dial with the numbers ranging not along the equator,
but along the Ecliptic itself. The square, cycle of the Ecliptic, would thus
have to be sub-divided into 27 or 28 compartments. Instead of this, the
number of Naksatras is augmented to 32, so that each field of the border
represents a lunar mansion or Naksatra. In the Vastumandala their
number is thus adjusted to the helio-planetary cosmogram of the
Prthivimandala. There, the four cardinal points, with reference to the
Ecliptic are the equinoxial and solstitial points in the annual cycle. The
solar cycles of the days and years are shown in the Vastumandala together
with the lunations, the monthly revolutions of the moon around the
earth. The solar-spatial symbolism is primary and the lunar symbolism
is accommodated within the Vastu-diagram (Kramrisch, 1946, p. 31).
According to Kramrisch, the Vastumandala represents a compos¬
ite of different traditions, and she also mentions a different scheme in



2.5 Lords of the Directions 45
which naksatras and their presiding demigods are linked to the
cardinal directions (Kramrisch, 1946, p. 34). These demigods are said
to rule over positions of entrances to the planned building, and they
differ from the 32 Padadevatas.
The ecliptic/Vastumandala link represents a scheme in which part
of the earth (where a building is to be erected) is identified with the
ecliptic in the sky. There is a similar identification in the Bhagavatam,
where the earth-disk, Bhu-mandala, represents the ecliptic plane. It
may therefore be significant that the Puranic Loka-palas on Mount
Meru are connected with the Vastupurusamandala of Vdstu Sdstra.
Adrian Snodgrass describes the symbolism of the Vastupurusa¬
mandala, and he also relates it to a cosmological account in which the
Trayastrimsa Heaven of Indra is situated on Mount Meru, along with
32 directional demigods representing the equinoxes and solstices
and the 28 naksatra divisions of the ecliptic. He points out that this
symbolism was reflected in the medieval Burmese kingdom of Pegu,
in which 32 provinces surrounding the capital city represented the
ecliptic and the Loka-palas (Snodgrass, 1990, pp. 210-11).
Snodgrass also points out that elaborate astronomical symbol¬
ism was built into the temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia. Thus
Angkor Wat “incorporates at least twenty-two significant alignments
to equinoctial and solstitial solar risings” (Snodgrass, 1990, p. 216).
This implies that Hindu temple builders in Indochina must have been
interested in making quantitative astronomical observations, and it
may indicate some of the practical astronomy lying behind the
Vastumandala concept.
Snodgrass also listed over thirteen different astronomical quanti¬
ties that were built into the temple of Angkor Wat in multiples of a
unit of length called the hat (Sanskrit hasta). For example, “the
interior axial lengths of the nine chambers in the central tower are 27
on the east-west axis and 28 on the north-south axis, referring to the
27 or 28 lunar mansions (naksatra) and to the 28 days on which the
moon is visible each month” (Snodgrass, 1990, p. 217).
An interesting feature is the latitude of Angkor Wat, which equals
the local elevation of the polar axis. This is expressed in the building
by several lengths of 13.43 hat, where one hat represents one degree
of latitude. This is accurate to 60-90 seconds of arc (Snodgrass, 1990,



46 2. The Islands and Oceans of Bhu-mandala
p. 221). Also, several lengths of 432, 864, 1,296, and 1,728 hat in
different parts of the building express the four yugas—time periods
which endure for corresponding numbers of millenia (Snodgrass,
1990, p. 223). (The yuga system is discussed in Section 8.4.)
The hat itself is 0.43454 meters, which is very close to the 0.432
meter hasta discussed in Section 4.5 on the length of the yojana (Snod¬
grass, 1990, p. 217). This unit, in turn, emerges independently in the
study of the correlation between planetary orbits and Bhu-mandala
reported in Section 4.4.



The Solar System in Projection
3.1 THE FLAT EARTH AS A PLANISPHERE
In this chapter and Chapters 4 through 6, we present the four major
interpretations of Bhu-mandala listed in the Introduction (p. 3). We
first interpret Bhu-mandala as a polar projection map of the earth.
Like the others, this interpretation requires us to focus on certain
features of Bhu-mandala while neglecting others.
The features to be neglected in this case are the large dimensions
assigned to the dvlpas of Bhu-mandala in the Bhagavatam. These
begin with 100,000 yojanas for both the diameter of Jambudvlpa and
the width of the surrounding, annular Salt Ocean. They proceed by a

process of doubling, in which the width of each annular ring is twice
(or more) the width of the one inside it, resulting quickly in rings the
size of planetary orbits.
This is not appropriate for a representation of the earth globe. But
we see that cosmological drawings from India typically neglect this
doubling, and compress all of Bhu-mandala into a compact picture
with equal rings. Figure 3.1 is an example published by the early British
Indologist, Francis Wilford (1805).
The map with equalized rings can be interpreted as a stereographic
projection of the earth-globe onto a flat plane (Figure 3.2). Stereo¬
graphic projection maps the surface of a globe onto a plane tangent to
the globe’s north pole. This is done by drawing a line from the south
pole through any given point on the globe and extending it until it
reaches the tangent plane.
The resulting map of the earth is called a planisphere (Figure 3.3).
This method is one of many ways of creating a polar projection of the
earth globe. It has the advantage that it is simple and it maps any great
circle on the globe onto a circle in the plane. It was known by Greek
astronomers in the time of Ptolemy.
If Bhu-mandala is a planisphere, or stereographic projection of the
globe, then the original globe must be as shown in Figure 3.4. Here, we
simply map Bhu-mandala with equalized rings onto a sphere, using

inverse stereographic projection. This was done in such a way as to
map the circular boundary of Jambudvipa onto the equator.
In fact, such globes exist in India. The one in Figure 3.5 was
probably commissioned by Sawai Jai Singh, Raja of Jaipur, in the early
eighteenth century. Indian astronomical texts (.Jyotisa Sastras), such as
Siddhanta-siromani also describe the layout of the globe in this way.
In the picture of this globe on the left, the land area between the
equator and the mountain arc is Bharata-varsa. Some thirty-six place
names for locations in India have been transliterated by Joseph
Schwartzberg in this region (Schwartzberg, 1987, pp. 396-97). The
Ganges and Yamuna rivers are shown, flowing past Kashmir, Delhi
and Agra, to Prayaga and KasI (Benares), where they join. This is one
of several small inaccuracies, since these rivers actually join at Prayaga.
The Ganges is shown reaching the sea at Calcutta, and a large temple
of Jagannatha is depicted nearby. Lanka is centered on the prime
meridian along with Ujjain, as is stated in Jyotisa Sastras. Outside of
Bharata-varsa there are relatively few recognizable names. These
include Mecca (Makkah) in the west, Manasaghati (the ghats on lake
Manasarowar in Tibet?) in the north, and Mahachin and Chin (Greater
China and China) in the east.
If we interpret Bhu-mandala as a planisphere, the north pole must
be the center of Mount Meru and the footprint of Meru roughly
matches the Arctic region. Bharata-varsa corresponds to India, which



3.1 The Flat Earth as a Planisphere 51
is known as Bharata even today by the Indian people. The ring-shaped
dvipas surrounding Jambudvlpa represent parallel bands of equal
latitude falling in the southern hemisphere. However, none of the eight
varsas of Jambudvlpa other than Bharata-varsa corresponds to a
recognizable region of the earth globe.
This map is therefore clearly intended for astronomical, rather
than geographical, purposes. Indeed, it can be argued that the geo¬
graphical features of Jambudvlpa actually do not relate to the earth
globe as a whole, but to a localized region of south-central Asia
centered on the Pamir mountains (see Section 5.1). This is another
important interpretation of Jambudvlpa.
Nonetheless, Jambudvlpa has evidently been interpreted as a
polar projection map for a long time. There is even evidence that this
interpretation somehow made its way into Europe. In 1569, Gerhard
Mercator published a polar projection map of the Arctic region. This
map shows an imaginary circular continent centered on the north pole,
with a mountain at the pole, and what appear to be four rivers ema¬
nating from the pole at right angles. This corresponds to Jambudvlpa,
with the four branches of the Ganges extending at right angles from
Mount Meru.
One may ask whether Jambudvlpa, as described in the Bhagavatam
and other Purdnas, was originally seen as a planisphere, or whether
the planisphere interpretation was made later on in the Jyotisa Sastras
when the idea of the earth as a globe was introduced by the Greeks.
The answer is that there are several points in the text of the Bhagavatam
that make sense in light of the planisphere interpretation, but that do
not make sense if Jambudvlpa and Bhu-mandala are thought of as
lying literally in one plane. This lends support to the hypothesis that
the planisphere interpretation was originally built into the Purdnas.
In the remainder of this chapter, we discuss these points step by
step, along with several related topics that arise in connection with the
planisphere model. These include the length of the day, the zodiac, the
distance of the moon, eclipses, and constellations.
3.1.1 Day and Night Reverse at the Antipodes
There are statements in the Bhagavatam that indirectly treat the
earth as a globe. In texts 5.21.8-9, the Bhagavatam says:



52 3. The Solar System in Projection
The sun sets at the diametrically opposite point from where it rises.
The sun puts people to sleep [as at midnight] at the diametrically opposite
point from where it heats with perspiration [as at midday]. Those who
go [to the opposite point] do not see [the sun] as the same.
This clearly works on the earth globe, since a point where the sun
is rising is diametrically opposite to a point where it is setting and a
point in daylight is diametrically opposite to a point in darkness. But
it does not work on a plane.
According to the Bhagavatam, the sun orbits just above Bhu-man
dala on its chariot. Its rays should spread out smoothly over a literal
plane, leaving no points of sunrise or sunset and no area in total dark¬
ness. This contradicts the Bhagavatam’s statement in 5.21.8-9, but
there is no contradiction if we adopt the planisphere interpretation.
Since the planisphere model is a map of a globe, it does have a sharp
boundary between day and night, as well as a meaningful definition of
“diametrically opposite.”
The Aitareya Brahmana contains a statement similar to 5.21.8-9 in
the Bhagavatam. It says that
He (i.e. the sun) neither sets nor rises. What is believed to be his set
is his turning himself around at the end of the day. He makes night on
this side and day on the other. Similarly, what is taken to be his rise in the
morning is his turning himself around at the end of the night, when he
makes day on this side and night on the other side. In fact, he never sets
(Dikshit, 1969a, p. 9).
This suggests that the idea of the earth as a globe may date back to
Vedic times, well before the period of the known Jyotisa Sastras.
The equator, the tropic of Cancer, the tropic of Capricorn, and the
ecliptic are shown in Figure 3.6, projected onto the surface of a globe.
These circles can be projected stereographically, as shown in Figure
3.7. The sun is always positioned somewhere on the great circle of the
ecliptic, which is tilted on the globe at an angle of 23V20 to the equator.
The sun’s position on the globe and its corresponding position on the
planisphere map both represent the point on the earth where the sun
is at the zenith.
The terminator, or boundary between day and night, is a great
circle on the globe that is perpendicular to the sun’s zenith position. It

54 3. The Solar System in Projection
projects stereographically onto a circular arc on the planisphere that
rotates once every 24 hours. At the equinoxes, this arc becomes a
straight line. At the solstices it bends so that the north polar region is
in light (northern summer) or in darkness (northern winter). This is
shown in Figures 3.9-11.
According to the Bhdgavatam 5.21.7, the passage of day and night
is caused by the rotation of the sun around the circle of Manasottara
mountain in Bhu-mandala. At the cardinal points along this circle are
four cities of the demigods, listed in Table 2.9 (p. 40).
As the sun moves past these cities, the half circle within plus or
minus 90° of the sun is in light and the opposite half circle is in darkness.
This motion is clarified by a passage in the Visnu Purana: “When the
sun (at midday) passes over [one] of the cities of the gods on Manasottara
mountain (at the cardinal points), his light extends to three cities and
two intermediate points; when situated in an intermediate point, he
illuminates two of the cities and three intermediate points (in either
case one hemisphere)” (Wilson, 1980, p. 316). As before, the four cities
of the gods are situated at the cardinal points, with an angle of 90° from
one to another. When the sun is over a city, the three illuminated cities
are at -90°, 0°, and 90° from the sun. The two intermediate points are
at -45° and 45°.
This description of day and night makes no sense on a literal plane,
but it corresponds exactly to the planisphere model at a time near the
equinoxes, when the day/night terminator is a straight line. This gives
support to the hypothesis that the Bhdgavatam makes deliberate use
of the planisphere model.

3.1.2 The Speeds of the Sun
In a planisphere, the zodiac projects onto the earth map as we see
in Figure 3.12. The sun moves around the zodiac once per year, and it
spends half the year going from north to south and half going from



56 3. The Solar System in Projection
south to north. While going north, the sun approaches the center of
the planisphere, and while going south it moves towards the periph¬
ery. This is due to the off-centered projection of the ecliptic caused by
stereographic projection.
In the course of a day, the zodiac and ecliptic circles sweep around
the planisphere relative to the fixed earth map. This daily motion is
clockwise, whereas the yearly motion of the sun around the ecliptic is
counterclockwise. Since the projected ecliptic circle is off-center, the
sun moves faster in the northern winter, when its distance from the
center of the planisphere is greater, and it moves slower in the northern
summer, when it is closer to the center.
The same is true of the sun’s yearly motion. In the simplest model,
the sun moves around the ecliptic at a constant speed. (Due to its
elliptical orbit, the sun’s speed around the ecliptic actually varies
slightly.) But due to the distortion caused by stereographic projection,
the sun’s yearly motion is faster on the planisphere when it is to the
south (away from the center) and slower when it is to the north (close
to the center).
The days in the northern hemisphere become shorter when the
sun is beneath the equator and longer when the sun is above it, and
thus longer days are associated with slower speed of the sun on the
Figure 3.12 Stereographic
projection of the ecliptic
and the zodiac onto a
planisphere map of the
earth. The sun is shown,

the zodiac.



3.1 The Flat Earth as a Planisphere 57
planisphere, and shorter days are associated with faster speed.
The Bhagavatam 5.21.3 sums up all of these points as follows:
The sun makes days and nights short, long, and medium, while advan¬
cing according to the time with low, high, and moderate speeds, called
north-going, south-going, and middle-going. It does this in the sign
Makara, etc., which are places of ascent, descent, and staying midway.
Note that all of the points in this statement make sense on a plane
if and only if it is interpreted as a planisphere.
In this text, ‘"north-going” (udagayana) and “south-going” (daksi
nayana) are used in a nonstandard sense. In Jyotisa Sdstras, these terms
refer to the periods when the sun is moving north or south, respec¬
tively. But here they refer to the times when the sun is situated to the
north or to the south (i.e. north or south of the equator). Grammati¬
cally, in udagayana, udag can be interpreted as being in the accusative
or in the locative. In the former case, the meaning is “toward the
north,” and in the latter, it is “within the north” (Howard Resnick,
personal communication). The same point can be made regarding
daksindyana and the south.
The reason for the sun’s three speeds is not explicitly mentioned
in the Bhagavatam, but the Visnu Purana does refer to it:
As the circumference of a potter’s wheel revolves most rapidly, so the
sun travels rapidly on his southern journey. ... As the center of the
potter’s wheel revolves more slowly than the circumference, so the sun
in his northern path again revolves with less rapidity, and moves over a
less space of the earth in a longer time . .. (Wilson, 1980, p. 319).
This implies that the sun moves near the center when it moves
north and near the circumference when it moves south, in agreement
with the planisphere model. One consequence of this is that the sun
should cross the dvipas of Bhu-mandala as it moves to the north and
to the south.
The movement of the sun across the dvipas and oceans is indirectly
discussed by Vamsidhara in an extensive commentary on the Bhaga
vatam verse 5.1.30 (see Appendix 2). This verse describes how Priyavrata
created a second sun by orbiting opposite the sun in a brilliant chariot
created by mystic power:



58 3. The Solar System in Projection
While Bhagavan Aditya [the sun] illumines the gods’ mountain
[Meru], continuously going around, he heats only half of the land up to
Lokaloka Mountain, and he covers half [with darkness]. Not approving
of this, Priyavrata, having accumulated superhuman power by the
worship of the Lord, [thought] ‘I shall make night into day.’ With a chariot
built of light of the same speed, he went seven times around, following
the movement of the sun like a second sun.
Vamsldhara gives an interpretation in which Priyavrata’s counter¬
sun crosses the seven oceans and dvipas in half a year while moving out
from the center, and again crosses them in half a year while moving
back towards the center. The real sun moves opposite Priyavrata’s sun
and does the same thing in reverse order. Vamsidhara’s interpretation
is backed up by statements in the Matsya Purana (Taluqdar, 1916,
pp. 339-41) and the Vayu Purana (Tagare, 1987, pp. 338-39). These
statements seem to refer to the path of the sun covering different
dvipas at different times of the year, but unfortunately the numbers
cited in these texts are corrupt (at least in the English translations).
They support the planisphere interpretation of Bhu-mandala, without
explicitly recognizing it.
We finally note that Caitanya Mahaprabhu referred to the motion
of the sun across the dvipas and oceans in his teachings to Sanatana
Goswami. He said, “The sun moves across the zodiac (jyotis-cakra)
day and night and crosses the oceans between the seven islands one
after the other” (Caitanya-caritamrta, Madhya-lila 20.387).
3.1.3 Mapping Canopus
The Vayu Purana gives an interesting example of a point that can
be interpreted easily in terms of the planisphere model. This text says
that “ Agastya (the star Canopus) traverses quickly over the guardians
of the worlds stationed in the four quarters over the mountain Loka¬
loka” (Tagare, 1987, p. 340). The ring-shaped Lokaloka Mountain is
defined in the Bhagavatam 5.20.34 as the outer boundary of the
illuminated region of Bhu-mandala, and Canopus is a southern
hemisphere star with a declination of 52° 41.7' south. It is named after
the sage Agastya, who is famous for having traveled to the south
without ever returning.
It appears that the Vayu Purana is mapping the latitude of Cano



3.1 The Flat Earth as a Planisphere 59
pus to Lokaloka Mountain in the planisphere map. The rapid motion
of Agastya is due to the fact that Canopus maps to a planisphere radius
nearly three times the radius of the planisphere equator. Thus Agastya’s
rate of daily rotation is three times as great as that of an equatorial star.
It makes sense for Agastya to circle quickly over Lokaloka mountain
in the planisphere interpretation, but without this interpretation its
motion is difficult to understand.
3.1.4 Bhu-mandala and the Astrolabe
In 1985, W. Randolph Kloetzli published an article giving a
planisphere interpretation to the cosmology of the Visnu Purana, and
he compared Bhu-mandala and the sun’s chariot with an astrolabe
a medieval instrument that performs spherical astronomy in a plane
through stereographic projection (Kloetzli, 1985). His reasoning sug¬
gests that Bhu-mandala and its accompanying planetary orbits may
have been deliberately laid out as a kind of astrolabe model.
It is not clear whether or not there is any historical connection
between the astrolabe and Puranic cosmology, but there are strong
Figure 3.13 Mercator’s
astrolabe (1545), in the
Moravska Gallery, Brno.



60 3. The Solar System in Projection
conceptual parallels between the two. The structure of an astrolabe
involves a stack of plates marked with stereographic projections
representing, among other things, the earth, the orbit of the sun
(ecliptic), and selected stars. This arrangement can be compared with
Puranic cosmology, in which the sun, moon, stars, and planets are
assigned to a series of levels above the earth plane. We discuss this
below in Section 3.4, in connection with the orbits of the sun and
moon.
Otto Neugebauer traced the theory of stereographic projection
back to the Greek astronomer Hipparchus, who lived around 150 B.C.,
and possibly to Eudoxus, who lived two centuries previously (Neuge¬
bauer, 1975, p. 858). However, Neugebauer admitted that the evi¬
dence in this regard is scanty. In the second century A.D., Ptolemy
wrote a treatise on stereographic projection, known as Planisphaer
ium. The first evidence of an actual astrolabe comes from Theon of
Alexandria, who lived in the fourth century (Neugebauer, 1975,
p. 877). If the Puranic idea of a planisphere was borrowed from the
Greeks, this could conceivably have happened as far back as Eudoxus.
Of course, this idea could have been invented independently in
India.
3.2 DAY, NIGHT, AND THE SEASONS
As we have seen, the Bhagavatam gives a simple rule for the
passage of day and night which, from the point of view of the plani¬
sphere model, is realistic at the time of the equinoxes. For times on
either side of the equinoxes, the Bhagavatam gives a linear correction
term that works well in northern India. Let us examine this correction
to see how accurate it is.
The Bhagavatam verses 5.21.4 and 5.21.5 state that the vernal
equinox occurs in the beginning of Mesa (Aries), as we would expect
in a tropical zodiac. The day increases at the expense of the night by
one ghatika (24 minutes) per month in the morning and evening until
the beginning of Cancer. The day then decreases at the same rate until
the equinox in Libra, and continues decreasing until the winter solstice
in Capricorn. Then it again increases at the same rate until the begin¬
ning of Aries.



3.2 Day, Night, and the Seasons 61
A ghatika is half of a muhurta, and a muhurta is V30 of a full day
and night. The rule assumes that one ghatika per month is added in
both the morning and the evening. Therefore, it says that when the
sun is going north, the length of the day in muhurtas is 15 + t, where
t is the number of months before or after the vernal equinox (and t
ranges from -3 to +3). When the sun is going south, this becomes 15
- t, with t centered on the autumnal equinox.
In the Vedic astronomical text called Jyotisavedahga, the rule is
that six muhurtas are added to the daytime in a northern progress of
the sun from the winter to the summer solstice. The same (in reverse)
takes place in a southern progress. This is the same as the Bhagavatam
rule.
The Jyotisavedahga places the winter solstice in the beginning of
the naksatra, Dhanistha, and this enables us to use precession of the
equinoxes to estimate its date (Dikshit, 1969a, p. 87). This calculation
is done by determining the time when the beginning of the Dhanistha
interval of the ecliptic falls on the winter solstice. If we assume that the
principal star of the Dhanistha constellation (Beta Delphini) marks
the beginning of the interval, then the date comes to about 1400 B.C.
But if we use the intervals given in medieval Jyotisa Sastras, the date
falls about 300 years later. Unfortunately, neither calculation is reli¬
able because we do not know how naksatra intervals were defined
when the Jyotisavedahga was written.
The Indologist David Pingree rejected precessional dating and
reduced the date of the Jyotisavedahga to the fourth or fifth century
B.C. He argued that its day-length rule was imported from Babylon,
where it was in use since about 700 B.C. (Pingree, 1973, pp. 3-4).
We note that Pingree’s date doesn’t work precessionally, since the
principal star of the Sravana naksatra (Altair) was nearly on the winter
solstice in 300-500 B.C., thus ruling out Dhanistha. However, one
could argue that the text referred back to an earlier period, when the
winter solstice was in Dhanistha.
The modern rule for the length of the day is given by a smooth
trigonometric curve that depends on latitude. One way to compare
the modern rule with the ancient one is to take the average of the
absolute values of the difference between the two rules over an entire
year. This is given for a number of ancient cities in the following table:



62 3. The Solar System in Projection
TABLE 3.1
The Day-Length Rule at Different Latitudes
i. r Latitude average day-length difference
City (degrees N) (in minutes)

Lahore 31.49 7.46
Ur 31.03 6.97
Eridu 30.89 6.84
Delhi 28.70 6.56
Mathura 27.50 7.98
Varanasi 25.43 13.16
The behavior of the Jyotisavedahga rule at the solstices is some¬
times used to argue that it came from the Near East. Thus Pingree
points out that the rule’s ratio of longest to shortest day is 3:2, “a ratio
inappropriate to all parts of India save the extreme north-west, but one
that is well-attested in cuneiform texts” (Pingree, 1973, p. 4). This
argument assumes that people would consider only the longest and
shortest days when formulating a day-length rule.
However, people might also be interested in overall accuracy.
From this standpoint, the rule works as well in much of northern India
as it does in the Near East, and thus it may have been devised in India.
For example, at the latitude of Delhi, the rule works quite well over a
broad range of dates centered on the equinoxes, but it tends to become
inaccurate near the solstices (see Figure 3.14). At the latitude of
Babylon, it is better near the solstices, but worse overall. On the whole,
the rule creates smaller errors for Delhi than for Babylon.
Since the Bhdgavatam focuses attention on the equinoxes, it is
worth our while to see how the day-length rule works when time is
measured relative to the vernal equinox. An order zero approximation
to day length is simply 15 muhurtas, corresponding to equal day and
night. A first order approximation is a straight line with a slope of 1
muhurta per month. In fact, this is close to the slope of the true day
length curve at the vernal equinox at the latitude of Delhi. (For the
autumnal equinox, the slope is -1.)

Figure 3.14 Day length at different times of the year at Delhi (solid line: Bhagavatam
rule; dotted line: actual day-length graph at the latitude of Delhi).
The Jyotisavedahga makes use of a five-year cycle based on a year
of 365 civil days or 366 sidereal days (see Section 1.4). In this regard,
Pingree remarks that “the acceptance of this cycle by Indians for a
period of six or seven centuries or even more demonstrates among
other things that they were not interested in performing the simplest
acts of observational astronomy” (Pingree, 1973, p. 9). Although this
is a rather extreme statement, we do see a tendency for Indian sacred
texts to preserve astronomical information for long periods of time
without observational checking. Thus the Rg version of the Jyotisa
vedahga continues to be recited today as a limb of the Vedas, even
though the winter solstice is by now far removed from Dhanistha.
Likewise, the day-length rule works well in northern India, but it is also
recited in southern India where it is quite inaccurate.
S. B. Dikshit remarked that in the Rg version of the Jyotisaveddh
ga, “a number of verses contain words giving erroneous meaning. The
words are incorrect; still it is interesting to see that these are recited
throughout India in this form” (Dikshit, 1969a, p. 67). Dikshit con¬
cluded from this that the text was once nearly lost. It was imperfectly



64 3. The Solar System in Projection
restored, perhaps from a single faulty copy, and was then recited by
rote down to the present day.
People devoted to faithfully copying or reciting religious texts are
not likely to be interested in observational verification, but they do
play a useful role in preserving ancient knowledge. The existence of
processes of rigid preservation does not imply that scientific investiga¬
tions of nature were not carried out in India in the distant past. Rather,
such processes provide a way of preserving some of the findings of such
investigations from the ravages of time.
3.3 THE ZODIAC IN INDIA
Since we have run across several references in the Bhagavatam to
the signs of the zodiac, we should examine this topic in greater detail.
In India, these signs, called rasis, represent 30° intervals of the ecliptic,
and their Sanskrit names are close in meaning to the traditional names
used for the tropical zodiac in the West:
TABLE 3.2
Signs of the Zodiac
Sanskrit Name Western Name
Mesa (ram) Aries
Vrsabha (bull) Taurus
Mithuna (couple) Gemini
Karkata (crab) Cancer
Simha (lion) Leo
Kanya (daughter) Virgo
Tula (scales) Libra
Vrscika (scorpion) Scorpio
Dhanur (bow) Sagittarius
Makara (shark/crocodile) Capricorn
Kumbha (pot or waterpot) Aquarius
Mina (fish) Pisces
The similarities are close enough that these two lists of names
surely derive from a common source. The names of the signs went



3.3 The Zodiac in India 65
through a series of historical stages in Babylon, and they originally
referred to a series of constellations distributed roughly along the
ecliptic. For example, a Babylonian tablet of 700 B.C. lists eighteen
“constellations in the path of the moon.” These can be identified as
follows (van der Waerden, 1953, p. 219):
TABLE 3.3
Early Babylonian Constellations of the Zodiac
Meaning of Babylonian Name Western Name
The hair bush Pleiades
The bull of Anu Taurus
Anu’s true shepherd Orion
The old man Perseus
Sword Auriga

The scales Libra
Scorpion Scorpio
Archer? Sagittarius
Goatfish Capricornus
Great star or giant? Aquarius
The tails Pisces
The great swallow Pisces SW and Epsilon Pegasi
The goddess Anunitum Pisces NE and middle of Andromeda
The hireling Aries
This list underwent various changes, until the well-known twelve
zodiacal constellations were established in late-Babylonian times.
In India, the rdsis appear only in the form of twelve 30° divisions
of the ecliptic (Dikshit, 1969b, p. 397), a stage reached in Babylon in
about 419 B.C. (van der Waerden, 1953, p. 217). The zodiacal constel¬
lations are not described in Indian literature.
S. B. Dikshit reports that the twelve rasi names do not appear in the
Mahdbharata, even though this work contains many references to the



66 3. The Solar System in Projection
twenty-eight naksatras, which are themselves divisions of the ecliptic
named after constellations (Dikshit, 1969a, p. 108). The rasis do not
appear in the Jyotisavedahga texts (Dikshit, 1969a, p. 96) or in the
Vedas. This suggests that they were not current in India when these
works were written. The common source for the zodiac is therefore
likely to be located in the Near East.
It is possible, however, that the signs of the zodiac were simply
inserted into an already existing system in India, based on solar
months. Verse 5.22.5 states that the sun “passes through the twelve
months, the parts of the year that are named after the rasis.” The names
of the sun and the month names are listed as follows in the Bhagavatam
(12.11.33-44), but contrary to 5.22.5, they are not related to the names
of the zodiacal signs:
TABLE 3.4

Aryama Madhava
Mitra Sukra
Varuna Suci
Indra Nabhas
Vivasvan Nabhasya
Pusa Tapas
Parjanya Tapasya
Amsu Sahas
Bhaga Pusya
Tvasta Isa
Visnu Urja
The names of the sun are ancient Indian names for demigods. The
month names are also ancient in India and are based on the seasons
(with Madhu and Madhava being the sweet months of spring). The
signs of the tropical zodiac could easily have been inserted into this
system, once they were introduced into India. Here the point is that a



3.4 The Sun and the Moon 67
twelvefold division of the sun’s path that is based on seasons is tropical
by definition. It differs from the tropical zodiac only in the names of the
divisions. (The tropical zodiac and its implications for the dating of the
Bhdgavatam are discussed in greater detail in Section 8.2.)
3.4 THE SUN AND THE MOON
The Visnu Purana states that the sun orbits 100,000 yojanas above
the earth (Wilson, 1980, p. 307), and the Bhdgavatam is consistent with
this figure. The yojana is roughly eight miles long (see Section 4.5), and
so this comes to about 800,000 miles. However, this distance refers to
height above Bhu-mandala, and it does not say how far the sun is from
the earth globe.
In the planisphere model, the height of the sun is not physical. In
this model, different planes are used to accommodate different orbit¬
ing bodies. The position of an orbiting body over the earth plane
simply tells us the point on the earth globe where that body is directly
overhead. The height of the body above the earth plane is irrelevant.

68 3. The Solar System in Projection
In Section 3.1.4 above, we compared Bhu-mandala, interpreted as
a planisphere, with a medieval astrolabe. In an astrolabe, there is a ring
representing the orbit of the sun (the ecliptic) and a series of points
representing the locations of stars. These elements are part of the
“rete,” which is positioned over the ‘‘mater” plate representing the
earth. For comparison, above Bhu-mandala there is a plane for the so¬
lar orbit and another plane for the naksatra constellations.
There is also a separate plane for the orbit of the moon. The Bha
gavatam verse 5.22.8 says that the moon is 100,000 yojanas above the
sun, and this is often taken as a highly unscientific statement. However,
it makes perfect sense from the viewpoint of the planisphere interpre¬
tation. The sun and the moon both require planes above the earth
plane, but this has nothing to do with their distances from the earth
globe. If the earth is represented as a planisphere in the Bhagavatam,
then it stands to reason that the sun and the moon could also be part
of the planisphere model.
According to the Bhagavatam, the planets have the following
heights in yojanas above Bhu-mandala:
TABLE 3.5
Heights of Celestial Bodies Above Bhu-mandala in Yojanas
Body Interval Height
Dhruvaloka 1,300,000 3,800,000
Sapta-rsi 1,100,000 2,500,000
Saturn 200,000 1,400,000
Jupiter 200,000 1,200,000

Mercury 200,000 800,000

Sun 10,000 100,000
Rahu [and Ketu] 90,000 90,000
Bhu-mandala 0 0
Note: A textual variant in the Bhagavatam assigns 300,000 yojanas to the
distance from the moon to the 28 naksatras.



3.4 The Sun and the Moon 69
The mechanical model shown in Figure 3.16 was designed to
illustrate how the sun and the moon fit into the planisphere interpre¬
tation. In the model, levels are included for the sun, the moon, the
twenty-eight naksatras or lunar mansions, and Rahu and Ketu. All of
the celestial bodies in the table of heights could be included on
different levels of such a planisphere model.
The sun orbits on the ecliptic circle, which moves in accordance
with the earth’s daily rotation. The moon’s orbit is also projected
stereographically onto a plane, and it is very similar to the sun’s orbit.

and it lies beneath the
moon’s orbit, shown as
a light, dashed circle.
The twenty-eight nak¬
satras are placed on the
gray disk above the
moon’s orbit.



70 3. The Solar System in Projection
Seen from above, the orbits of the sun and moon intersect at two
points, corresponding to the ascending and descending nodes of the
moon. In the model, black disks representing Rahu and Ketu are
placed at these points in a lower plane. In Indian astronomy, these
points are treated as dark planets connected with eclipses of the sun
and moon (see Section 3.4.1, below).
One may ask what view was held regarding the relative positions
of the sun and moon in the Vedic period. Dikshit cites the following
verse from the Taittiriya Sarhhita, indicating that the moon was be¬
lieved to be higher than the sun:
Agni had to stand in a lower position before wind and space on
account of the earth. The wind stooped low before the sun and sky on
account of space. Similarly, the sun had to stand low in position on
account of the moon and the stars; and the moon had to bend low before
Varuna on account of stars (Dikshit, 1969a, p. 5).
Here the sequence, “earth, sun, moon, stars,” agrees with the table
of heights. It is quite possible that this statement dates back to a period
before the planisphere model was introduced, when the moon was
regarded as literally further away than the sun. In that case, one could
argue that traditional ideas about the relative heights of the sun, moon,
and stars were preserved in the planisphere model, since that model
works equally well for any assignment of heights.
Then again, the idea that the moon is literally further away than the
sun may have came about through a misunderstanding of more sophis¬
ticated astronomical concepts. Such misunderstanding has certainly
prevailed in recent centuries, since it appears that the planispherelike
structure of Bhagavata cosmology has generally gone unrecognized in
medieval and recent times.
Cosmological models centered on Mount Meru were brought to
Eastern Asian countries by Buddhism. In Figure 3.17, we see a cosmo¬
logical model representing Mount Meru, a series of square dvipas and
oceans, and a series of orbits at different levels. Constellations of stars
are placed at one level on several small stands. Since the orbits are not
off-center relative to Meru, it would seem that the person who made
this picture was not explicitly aware of the planisphere model. Since
Buddhism is thought to have split off from Hinduism before the
Puranic period, it would be interesting to know how this apparently
Puranic imagery entered East Asian tradition.



3.4 The Sun and the Moon 71
Figure 3.17 East Asian planetary model, showing planetary orbits, star positions, and a square version of Mount Meru and the seven oceans and dv"ipas.
Although the planetary heights are arbitrary and nonphysical in the planisphere interpretation, they do have physical meaning in the interpretation of Bhü-mal)c;lala as the ecliptic plane. This interpreta tion is discussed in Chapter 4, and the topic of planetary heights is addressed in the Section 4.7.
3.4.1 Eclipses
The Bhiigavatam, says relatively little about eclipses, and what it does say is connected with a being named Rahu. Verse 5.24.2 gives the diameters of the sun, moon, and Rahu as multiples of ten thousand yojanas, and it says that Rahu tries to attack them out of enmity. Rahu is commonly described as a dark planet, but in the Bhiigavatan1 verses 8.9.24-25, it is explained that Rahu is the decapitated head of a demon who tried to steal the nectar of immortality after the churning of the Milk Ocean. Since the sun-god and moon-god foiled Rahu's attempted theft and brought about his decapitation by Vi�l)U, his head has been inimical to the sun and moon ever since and is responsible for solar and lunar eclipses. ln their comments on 5.24.3, Sridhara Swami and Visvanatha Cakravarti point out that although it is commonly said that Rahu swallows the sun or the moon, this actually does not happen because of the intervening distance between Rahu and these heavenly bodies. This distance is mentioned in 5.24.1, where it is stated that, according



72 3. The Solar System in Projection
Figure 3.18 In Indian iconography, the nine planets (navagraha) are sometimes
depicted as eight figures representing the sun and moon, the five planets Mer¬
cury through Saturn, and a single body representing Rahu and Ketu (Hartner,
1938, figure 7).
to some authorities, Rahu is situated 10,000 yojanas beneath the sun.
Viraraghava also says that there is no actual swallowing because of this
distance. Thus the commentators accept the quantitative statement
about Rahu’s distance from the sun, and they thereby reject the story
that Rahu eclipses the sun and moon by literally swallowing them.
Rahu has a counterpart called Ketu, which is also held responsible
for eclipses and is sometimes described as Rahu’s headless body. In
Indian iconography, the nine planets (navagraha) are sometimes
depicted as eight figures representing the sun and moon, the five
planets Mercury through Saturn, and a single body representing Rahu
and Ketu. This is the figure on the right in the illustration. Ketu is not
discussed in the Bhagavatam, but one hundred Ketus are briefly
mentioned in 6.637. These may represent comets and meteoric phe¬
nomena, which are generally called Ketus in Indian astronomical
literature.
In the Jyotisa Sdstras, Rahu and Ketu are identified with the
ascending and descending lunar nodes, the points of intersection of the
orbits of the sun and moon. Since eclipses can occur only when the sun
and moon are near one of these nodes, this gives Rahu and Ketu a role
to play in eclipses. However, the Jyotisa Sdstras explain solar and lunar



3.4 The Sun and the Moon 73
eclipses in the same way as modern astronomers, and they give cal¬
culations on this basis, predicting when eclipses will occur.
It is possible to reconcile this account of Rahu and Ketu with the
Bhdgavatam by making use of the planisphere interpretation of Bhu
mandala. As we have seen, in this interpretation, the sun, moon,
naksatras, and planets are assigned planes parallel to Bhu-mandala.
Rahu and Ketu can also be assigned positions in a plane beneath that
of the sun. In Figure 3.16, above, they are shown as black disks situated
beneath the intersection points of the solar and lunar orbits. This
agrees with the Bhdgavatam, and it yields the Jyotisa Sdstra interpre¬
tation when the planisphere model is viewed from above in projection.
However, another perspective on Rahu is introduced in the cos¬
mological section of the Vayu Purana. In a verse very similar to 5.24.2
of the Bhdgavatam, the Vayu Purana says, “The planets are brilliantly
illuminated due to their contact with the rays of the Sun. The diameter
of the sun is 9,000 yojanas. . . . The width of the Moon is twice that of
the Sun. Equal to them, Svarbhanu (Rahu) goes beneath. The planet
Rahu is created in globular form out of the shadow of the earth”
(Tagare, 1987, p. 367). A nearly identical statement is found in the
Matsya Purana.
Here the diameters given to the sun and moon are unrealistic, but
if we disregard them, we are left with a reasonable astronomical
interpretation of Rahu. If we regard Rahu as the conical shadow
(umbra) of the earth planet, then it can be truly said that Rahu covers
or even swallows the moon during a lunar eclipse. Of course, to give
this explanation, the Puranic writer must have thought of the earth as
a globe. A similar theory regarding the moon’s shadow is needed to
account for eclipses of the sun.
In Western astrology, the lunar nodes are associated with the
“head and tail of the dragon,” and this “dragon” seems closely related
to Rahu and Ketu. In Figure 3.19, we see an Islamic picture, drawn in
A.D. 1272, showing the angel Shamhurash beheading the eclipse
dragon (Hartner, 1938). This directly parallels the story of Rahu’s
decapitation by Visnu.
The painting in Figure 3.20 of Saint George slaying the Dragon was
made by Raphael in 1504, during the Renaissance. This should be
compared with the picture of Shamhurash slaying the eclipse dragon.
Unless its similarity to that picture is a complete coincidence, it would

seem that the story of the eclipse dragon was somehow woven into the
iconography of early Christianity without the preservation of any
indication of its original significance. (Saint George is said to have
been born in Asia Minor in about A.D. 300, but we have run across no
information indicating how he came to be connected with a dragon
(Chambers, 1967, p. 539).)
Evidently, the myth of Rahu has deep historical roots. One possi¬
bility is that this story was elaborated first, and scientific information
about lunar nodes or the shadow of the earth was incorporated much
later. If so, this scientific refurbishing must have occurred in both India
and the West, since the Rahu story appears to be ancient in both

areas. It is also possible that mythological stories and quantitative
models may have grown up together over a very long period of time.
Or it may even be that mythology has sometimes been added to
quantitative knowledge after the quantitative knowledge was already
developed.
The latter possibility is illustrated by the elaboration of astrologi¬
cal interpretations of the zodiacal signs. Thus B. L. van der Waerden
raises the question, “How came these signs, originally a mathematical
construction, afterwards to be worshiped like Gods and thought to
influence our lives like Gods?” (van der Waerden, 1953, p. 216). For
some further thoughts on this topic, see Section 6.4.



76 3. The Solar System in Projection
3.4.2 The Lunar Orbit in Surya-siddhanta
The Surya-siddhanta expresses distances in yojanas. If we take five
miles/yojana, we can bring the Surya-siddhanta’s diameter for the
earth globe into agreement with modern data. Using the same ratio of
miles/yojana, the Surya-siddhanta’s diameter for the moon and its
earth-moon distance also agree reasonably well with modern astronomy.
This is shown in the following table, with distances listed in miles:
TABLE 3.6
Earth-Moon Distances in Surya-siddhanta in Miles
Length Modern Surya-siddhanta
diameter of earth globe 7,928 8,000
diameter of moon 2,160 2,400
earth-moon distance 238,000 258,000
Here the Surya-siddhanta value of 258,000 miles for the earth
moon distance is computed from its figure of 324,000 yojanas for the
circumference of the moon’s orbit. Since this comes to fifteen yojanas
per minute of arc, it is clearly a very round figure.
The Jyotisa Sastras clearly present a realistic picture of the lunar
orbit and the size of the moon. The Puranas are generally considered
to be more or less contemporary with the Jyotisa Sastras, but they
present what seems, at first glance, to be the highly unscientific
conclusion that the moon is higher than the sun. However, this
statement does not mean that the moon is further from the earth than
the sun, and it can be reconciled with modern astronomy by adopting
the planisphere interpretation of Bhu-mandala.
Curiously, the Surya-siddhanta also encodes accurate values for
the diameters of the planets. This is discussed in Appendix 10.
3.5 THE LORE OF CONSTELLATIONS
Like many cultural traditions, the Puranic tradition of India main¬
tains stories about particular star patterns, or constellations. Since the



3.5 The Lore of Constellations 77
Bhdgavatam places stars in planes parallel to Bhu-mandala, its
treatment of stars can be best understood in terms of the planisphere
interpretation, which wraps these planes around the earth globe.
Therefore, we will relate a few of these stories at the end of this chapter.
Star stories typically connect demigods with stars and planets, and
they may explain astronomical phenomena in terms of social interac¬
tions between celestial personalities. Such stories coexist with purely
astronomical material that describes the regular behavior of heavenly
bodies. The personal stories are not allowed to contradict ongoing
regular phenomena, but they are sometimes used to explain the origin
of such phenomena.
For example, the constellation Rohini is the center of several Pura
nic star stories. According to Bhdgavatam 6.6.2, the twenty-seven na¬
ksatra constellations are considered to be daughters of Prajapati
Daksa who were given as wives to Candra, the demigod of the moon.
This story refers to the role of the naksatra constellations as “lunar
mansions” or markers indicating the progress of the moon in its orbit
(see Appendix 1).
The Bhdgavatam mentions that Candra was cursed by Daksa in
connection with these wives. Other Puranas explain that this hap¬
pened because Candra’s excessive fondness for RohinI caused dissat¬
isfaction among his other naksatra-wives. Their father Daksa there¬
fore cursed the moon to suffer from a wasting disease, and this curse
was later reduced by allowing the moon to wax and wane periodically
(Siva, 1990, pp. 1308-11).
This is one explanation of the moon’s phases. Another explana¬
tion is given in the Visnu Purana, where it is said that the waxing phase
of the moon is caused by the sun, who supplies the moon with ambrosia
through one of his rays. The waning phase is caused by the demigods
and pitrs, who take turns drinking the lunar ambrosia and thereby
obtain immortality (Wilson, 1980, p. 343).
The naksatra RohinI consists of the five principal stars of the
constellation Taurus, and its yoga-tara or “junction star” is Aldebaran.
(Significantly, RohinI means reddish, and Aldebaran is a reddish star.)
These stars are said to form a cart or wagon {sakata). The Surya
siddhanta states that “In Taurus, the 17th degree, a planet of which the
latitude is more than two degrees, south, will split the wain of RohinF
(Burgess, 1860, p. 248). In Sanskrit this is called “rohini sakata hheda."



78 3. The Solar System in Projection
The splitting of the wain of Rohini is considered to be inauspicious
in astrological texts. The sixth-century astrologer Varahamihira says
that “When Saturn splits the wain of RohinI here in this world, then
Madhava rains not upon the earth for twelve years. When the wain of
Prajapati’s asterism is split, the earth, having as it were committed a sin,
performs, in a manner, her surface being strewn with ashes and bones,
the kapalika penance” (Burgess, 1860, p. 249). The antiquity of these
ideas is shown by their use in literary allusions—for example, in the
Mahdbharata, Ravana in the company of Slta is said to be like Saturn
in conjunction with RohinI (van Buitenen, 1975, p. 741).
An interesting allusion to rohini sakata bheda is given in the Bha
gavatam 10.7.4, where it is said that Krsna’s mother Yasoda performed
a Vedic ceremony for Him on a day when the moon was in conjunction
with the constellation Rohini. On this occasion, Yasoda placed the
infant Krsna beneath a handcart {sakata) and, since she was busy
receiving guests, she did not hear Him crying for milk. Krsna became
angry at His mother’s neglect, and He threw His legs upward with the
following result:
Lord Sri Krsna was lying down underneath the handcart in one
corner of the courtyard, and although His little legs were as soft as leaves,
when He struck the cart with His legs, it turned over violently and
collapsed. The wheels separated from the axle, the hubs and spokes fell
apart, and the pole of the handcart broke .. . {Bhagavatam 10.7.7).
Thus Krsna broke a cart at the time of “rohini sakata bheda ” or the
••• • • '
breaking of the cart of Rohini by the moon.
In the Bhagavatam 10.3.1-5, Rohini is referred to as Krsna’s birth
star, and this is confirmed in the Brahma-vaivarta Parana, where it is
said that Krsna’s birth was “characterized by the predominance of
Rohini” (Sen, 1920, p. 129). It may, therefore, be significant that Ro¬
hini was at the vernal equinox at the traditional date of Krsna’s birth.
This is shown by the accompanying illustration from the as¬
tronomy program, SkyGlobe, which indicates that Rohini (Aldeba
ran) was situated on the vernal equinox in 3162 B.C. This figure will
vary by fifty years or so (an error of about 1%), depending on the
ephemeris program used to compute the date.



3.5 The Lore of Constellations 79
Figure 3.21 Position of Rohini (Aldebaran) in 3162 B.C., in relationship to the
vernal equinox.
According to traditional reckoning, Krsna took birth 125 years
before the advent of Kali-yuga in 3102 B.C. This would place the
moment when Rohini was exactly at the vernal equinox about midway
through Krsna’s life on the earth. Since modern scholarship rejects the
Kali-yuga date of 3102 B.C., this can be seen as one of the many curi¬
ous coincidences connected with this date. (For others, see Section
8.3.)
The Mahabharata presents some puzzling information about Rohini
and other asterisms that shows the complex background of Indian sky
lore. It seems that six wives of the Seven Sages (the Big Dipper or Ursa
Major) had been divorced by their husbands because they had become
implicated in the birth of the demigod Skanda. These wives appealed
to Skanda, who in turn asked Sakra (Indra) what should be done.
Sakra said:
‘The Goddess Abhijit, the younger sister of Rohini and her rival, has
gone to the forest to mortify herself. I am bewildered over it—hail to



80 3. The Solar System in Projection
thee—for now a constellation has dropped from heaven. Ponder with
Brahma the important time that constellation measured. Brahma mea¬
sured out time from Dhanistha onward. Rohini was the first, so the
number used to be full.’
At Sakra’s words the Krttikas went to heaven and now twinkle as a
constellation, in the form of a cart, with Fire as their regent (van Buitenen,
1975, p. 657).
Krttika is the constellation of the Pleiades, which is known to have
six prominent stars. These are considered to be the divorced wives of
the Seven Sages and mothers of the war-god Skanda, who is therefore
also known as Karttikeya. One of the wives of the sages remained
faithful and did not become involved in Skanda’s birth. She is known
as Arundhati, the wife of Vasistha, and she is identified with the star
Alcor, situated next to Vasistha’s star, Mizar.
Curiously, the Scholia to Aratus tells the opposite story. In this
text, Electra, mother of Dardanus, left her station among the Pleiades
as a consequence of Troy’s fall and retired “above the second star of
the beam . .. others call this star ‘fox’” (de Santillana, 1969, p. 385).
The second star of the beam is Vasistha in Sanskrit, and the “fox” star
is Arundhati.
Another possible cross-cultural link is given by the Vedic text
called the Satapatha Brahmana, which says that the Seven Sages (sapta
rsayah) were formerly called “bears” (rksah) (Eggeling, 1900, text
2.1.2.4). Of course, Ursa Major means “The Great Bear.”
Abhijit is the twenty-eighth naksatra and is missing from the
standard system of twenty-seven naksatras. Why she “went to the
forest” is not clear, but this may refer to the historical event of her
removal. The junction star of Abhijit is Vega, and it is notable for being
much further from the ecliptic than the other naksatras.
The statement about Brahma measuring time might be taken as a
reference to Brahma, the Creator. However, there is a link between
this statement and the sixth-century Jyotisa text called the Pahcasid
dhantika of Varahamihira. In this text there is a chapter on the Paitd
maha Siddhanta. This is a system of astronomical computation named
after Paitamaha, a name for Brahma (literally meaning grandfather).
This system defines its epoch as 2 Saka or A.D. 80, but it also gives a rule
placing the beginning of the year in Dhanistha (Thibaut, 1968, p. 67).



3.5 The Lore of Constellations 81
Thus the reference to Brahma could apply to the Paitamaha Siddhanta,
rather than to the Creator.
Varahamihira says that “When the return of the sun towards the
south (i.e. the summer solstice) took place from the middle of Aslesa,
then the ayana was right; at the present time the ayana begins from
Punarvasu” (Thibaut, 1968, p. 18). When the naksatra Aslesa is at the
summer solstice, Dhanistha is close to the winter solstice. This was
about 1000 B.C. It is also true that the summer solstice began near
Punarvasu in Varahamihira’s time (sixth century A.D.). Of course, if
the Mahabharata is referring to the Paitamaha Siddhanta, this may be
an early version of a text later rewritten by Varahamihira.
Finally, consider the statement that the Krttikas ascended to
heaven. In the Surya-siddhdnta, the naksatras are listed beginning with
Asvini. This naksatra interval begins with the star Revati (identified as
Zeta Piscium), which marked the vernal equinox in about A.D. 560.
(The star Revati falls 10' short of the end of its own interval, and thus
Revati + 10' defines the beginning of the next interval, Asvini (Bur¬
gess, 1860, p. 205).) Since many other texts (including the Bhagavatam)
list the naksatras as beginning with Krttika, some scholars have con¬
cluded that these other texts refer back to a time when Krttika was on
the vernal equinox (in roughly the second millennium B.C.). If this is
correct, then the statement that “the Krttikas went to heaven” may
refer to this time period, and the statement that “RohinI was the first”
may refer to the earlier period (around 3200 B.C.) when RohinI was on
the vernal equinox.

The Solar System in Three Dimensions
4.1 THE FLAT EARTH AS THE ECLIPTIC PLANE
There is a considerable body of textual evidence in the Bhagavatam
supporting the idea that Bhu-mandala corresponds to the ecliptic
plane, situated in three-dimensional space. This can be contrasted with
the planisphere interpretation, in which Bhu-mandala plays a two
dimensional role. In the previous chapter, we followed up on the idea
that Bhu-mandala is a planisphere model of the earth, and we found
that many points in Bhagavata cosmology can be consistently under¬
stood in light of this hypothesis.

84 4. The Solar System in Three Dimensions
In this chapter, we will do the same thing with the idea that Bhu
mandala represents an actual disk situated in three-dimensional space.
It turns out that this interpretation is also supported by many points.
This makes sense according to the general hypothesis that the Bhaga
vatam presents a multiple-aspect model of the universe, in which one
structure (e.g. Bhu-mandala) represents several different things.
The Bhagavatam describes the universe literally as a flat disk
(Bhu-mandala) situated in the middle of a sphere. The sun is described
as orbiting in a circular path situated parallel to this disk and very close
to it. In modern astronomy, the ecliptic is the plane of the sun’s
apparent orbit around the earth, as seen by an earthly observer. By
examining the Bhagavatam’s description of the sun’s orbit, we can see
that Bhu-mandala must closely correspond to the ecliptic if we take it
as a literal disk.
In the Bhagavatam, the sun’s orbit is described in terms of a
metaphorical solar chariot. The Bhagavatam verse 5.21.13 gives a
description of this chariot, where it is said that the chariot wheel is
composed of the parts of the year (Samvatsara in Sanskrit):
The chariot of the sun-god has only one wheel, which is known as
Samvatsara. The twelve months are calculated to be its twelve spokes,
the six seasons are the sections of its rim, and the three caturmasya
periods are its three-sectioned hub. One side of the axle carrying the
wheel rests upon the summit of Mount Sumeru, and the other rests upon
Manasottara Mountain. Affixed to the outer end of the axle, the wheel
continuously rotates on Manasottara Mountain like the wheel of an oil¬
pressing machine.
When the chariot is drawn to scale (in Figure 4.2, right), we see that
the chariot wheel is very small compared with the length of the axle,
which extends from Meru in the center to Manasottara in the periph¬
ery. Calculation shows that the length of the chariot’s axle from Mount
Meru to Manasottara Mountain is 157.5 times the height of the sun
above Bhu-mandala. The latter distance equals the radius of the wheel
plus the height of circular track on which it rides. Thus the sun skims
along just above Bhu-mandala in its orbit. Relative to the size of the
Manasottara track, Bhu-mandala is very close to the plane of the sun’s
orbit (and is parallel to it).
The most obvious interpretation of an earth disk sandwiched



4.1 The Flat Earth as the Ecliptic Plane 85
Figure 4.2 Model of the Sun's Chariot (to scale), showing the closeness of the
sun's orbit to the plane of Bhu-mandala.
between two hemispheres is that the disk represents the flat earth, the
upper hemisphere represents the sky, and the lower hemisphere
represents the underworld. According to this understanding, the
sun should rise on the eastern edge of the disk, arc overhead, and set
on the western edge. However, the Bhdgavatam has the sun moving
in a circle just above the flat earth. It should therefore skim along
the horizon, neither rising nor setting—a phenomenon seen in the
polar regions during certain times of the year, but not observable in
India.
Since the wheel of the sun’s chariot is called the year (Samvatsara),
it is reasonable to suppose that the motion of the sun around Sumeru
in its orbit can be taken as the sun’s yearly motion around the ecliptic.
This means that Bhu-mandala represents a plane parallel to the
ecliptic and very close to it. Roughly speaking, Bhu-mandala can be
identified as the ecliptic plane. It therefore does not represent a naive
flat earth. Rather, it represents a plane extending through the sky at a
steep angle to the plane of an observer’s local horizon.
Figure 4.3 shows the position of Bhu-mandala in relation to an
observer at a latitude corresponding to northern India. The square
tangent to the earth globe represents the observer’s local horizon—his
“flat earth.” The surrounding wire frame represents the celestial
sphere with the celestial equator. The plane of the ecliptic tilts at 23.5°
to the celestial equator, and there we have placed an annular shape
representing the disk of Bhu-mandala. Thus we see that Bhu-mandala

tion to an observer’s local
horizon. The small square

local horizon.
extends over the head of the observer and also beneath his feet.
It is noteworthy that in a cross-cultural study of myths from around
the world, Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend concluded
that an archaic world culture existed in which the earth was seen as the
celestial plane of the ecliptic—the realm of the gods and the planets
(see Appendix 3). It may be that the concept of the naive flat earth
arose when people began to take this cosmic earth-disk literally and
identify it with the ground on which they stood.
In many verses, the timing of the sun’s orbit around Bhu-mandala
clearly identifies it as the ecliptic plane. Thus the Bhagavatam verse
5.20.30 says that
In the middle of that island [Puskaradvipa] there is, indeed, one
mountain named Manasottara, which forms a boundary between the
inner and outer varsas.. .. The sun’s chariot is going around Meru on top
of the mountain, and that chariot has an orbit consisting of the Samvatsara,
which is turning around by the day and night of the demigods.
The Purdnas say that the day and night of the demigods is one year
(Samvatsara), with the day corresponding to the northern course of
the sun and the night corresponding to its southern course. So this text
says that the orbit of the sun around Meru on his chariot takes one year
to complete, as it should if Bhu-mandala represents the ecliptic.
Verse 5.22.7 of the Bhagavatam says:



4.1 The Flat Earth as the Ecliptic Plane 87
The sun-god has three speeds—slow, fast and moderate. The time
he takes to travel entirely around the circles of heaven, earth and space
at these three speeds is referred to, by learned scholars, by the five names
Samvatsara, Parivatsara, Idavatsara, Anuvatsara and Vatsara.
The circles of heaven, earth, and space refer to Bhu-mandala and
the adjacent region called Antariksa, which we will discuss in a mo¬
ment. The five names ending in vatsara all refer to the year. They
define a five-year cycle, or yuga, that is well known in Vedic and
Puranic literature. So we have the sun moving around the circle of
Bhu-mandala in a year, and therefore the Bhu-mandala disk and its
associated region of space correspond to the ecliptic.
Again, in 5.22.5 we read that
The sun-god, the soul of all the worlds, being situated in the circle of
space between heaven and earth on the wheel of time, passes through
the twelve months, the parts of the year that are named after the rasis.
The wheel of time is the starry heaven, which rotates once per day
relative to the earth. Here the twelve solar months are identified with
the 30° signs of the zodiac (rasis), which extend around the ecliptic. As
we mention in Section 3.3, this concept of the solar months may have
been native to India, and the Western signs of the zodiac may have
been grafted onto it later. Be that as it may, the “circle of space between
heaven and earth” is here associated with the zodiacal signs and hence
with the ecliptic plane.
This circle of space is also mentioned in verse 5.20.43:
The sun is situated in the middle of the Brahmanda, in the area
between heaven [dyav] and earth. The distance between the sun and the
circumference of the universe should be twenty-five koti yojanas.
The Brahmanda, or Brahma-egg, is the sphere of the universe in
Bhagavata cosmology. We need to know the meaning of “the area
between heaven and earth,” which is situated in the middle of this
sphere. Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that it means the region
from Bhuvarloka to Bhurloka. Bhurloka is another name for Bhu-mandala,
and Bhuvarloka is a region of space “above” Bhu-mandala. Vijaya
dhvaja identifies it as Antariksa, which literally means “inner space”:



88 4. The Solar System in Three Dimensions
The area between heaven and earth (dyav-abhumyoh) is Antariksa,
wherein the sun, which is found in the middle of the egg, is situated. The
Antariksa is the region in which the sun moves (into new signs), and that
is the middle region of the egg.
Srldhara Swami and Viraraghava both refer to this middle region as
being the space between the two shells of the egg. These two shells are
the upper and lower hemispheres of the Brahmanda. Ideally, these two
hemispheres are separated by the plane of Bhu-mandala. But if we
draw them slightly apart from one another, we create a thin cylinder of
space between the two hemispheres. This is Antariksa.
Putting these points together, it follows that the Bhu-mandala disk
is the base of a thin cylinder of Antariksa, in which the sun orbits and
passes from one sign of the zodiac to another. The ecliptic lies within
Antariksa, and Bhu-mandala is close to and parallel to it. Figure 4.1
shows the cylinder of Antariksa, with Bhu-mandala as its base. If we
turn to the distance figures given in the Bhdgavatam, we find that the
thickness of this cylinder can be computed to be 3,800,000 yojanas, the
height of Dhruvaloka above Bhu-mandala (see Table 3.5, p. 68). This
is very small, compared with its radius of 25 koti or 250,000,000 yojanas.
Thus in the figure, Antariksa is barely discernible.
We would expect that if the thin disk of space between earth and
heaven is the region of the ecliptic, then the Bhdgavatam should place
the orbits of the planets in or near this region. This turns out to be true,
and we discuss it below in Section 4.3. Once it is realized that the
planets orbit near Bhu-mandala, further study shows that the circular
features of Bhu-mandala serve as a map of the planetary orbits. This
is discussed in Section 4.4.
In summary, we see that if we interpret Bhu-mandala as the ecliptic
plane, then many obscure points made in the Bhdgavatam and its
commentaries fall into place consistently. Further points consistent
with this interpretation are mentioned in later sections.
4.2 RELATIVE MOTION IN THE BHAGAVATAM
We have cited evidence indicating that the sun orbits around Bhu
mandala once per year. Yet there appears to be a contradiction, for the
sun is also said to complete one orbit per day. As we will see, this



4.2 Relative Motion in the Bhagavatam 89
apparent contradiction arises because of the way that the Bhagavatam
treats relative motion.
The concept of relativity of motion plays an important role in
modern physics. It also arises in elementary astronomy, where we see
that the sun has two motions, a daily clockwise motion from east to
west and a yearly counterclockwise motion from west to east. The first
motion is relative to the earth as a fixed reference frame, and the
second motion is relative to the constellations.
The Bhagavatam recognizes both motions, but it treats them in
a paradoxical way by referring them to a single reference frame
Bhu-mandala. This gives rise to the two major interpretations of Bhu
mandala discussed in this chapter and in Chapter 3. These are the plan¬
isphere interpretation, in which the daily clockwise motion of the sun
is assumed, and the three-dimensional interpretation, in which the
sun’s yearly counterclockwise motion around the ecliptic is assumed.
In Bhagavatam 5.21.8-9, the narrator, Sukadeva GosvamI, says
that “For the people living there [on Meru], when the sun is specifically
at midday, it always heats, keeping the mountain to the left and
keeping it to the right.”
This appears contradictory, and it was so understood in the
Bhagavatam itself. Thus in 5.22.1, King Parlksit responds to Sukadeva
GosvamI by asking
Your Lordship has mentioned that the sun-god goes around Meru
and Dhruva, keeping them to the right, and also facing toward the rasis
and moving so as to keep them to the left. So, how can we understand
this reasonably?
The answer is given in 5.22.2:
He (Sukadeva GosvamI) then clarified: Just as ants etc., which are
spinning because they are resting on a spinning potter’s wheel, actually
have another movement because they are found in different places (on
the wheel), similarly, the planets, the sun etc., which are going around
because they are resting on the kala-cakra, which is seen to be going
around with naksatras and rasis, keeping Dhruva and Meru to the right,
actually have a different movement.



90 4. The Solar System in Three Dimensions
Thus the constellations correspond to the potter’s wheel, and the
sun and planets correspond to the ants. If we consider the earth as
fixed, then the sun and all the stars and planets orbit around Mount
Meru (the north polar axis) once per day, with Mount Meru to their
right. In contrast, if we consider the stars as fixed, then the sun orbits
around Mount Meru once per year, with Mount Meru to its left. The
daily motion of the sun, stars, and planets is attributed to the daksina
varta wind, which is conceived of as blowing all of these bodies around
the polar axis defined by Mount Meru and Dhruvaloka. This motion
is called the kala-cakra, or wheel of time. In constrast, the sun’s yearly
motion is attributed to its chariot, which is a metaphor for the year.
This is clarified by Sridhara Swami in his commentary on 5.21.8-9:
Although leftward movement, facing the naksatras, is his own motion
[svagatya], the sun moves around Meru to the right daily, being blown
by the pravaha wind, under the control of the jyotis-cakra.
4.3 THE PLANETARY ORBITS IN 3-D
The ecliptic defines the plane of the sun’s orbit around the earth,
and this is the same as the plane of the earth’s orbit around the sun.
With the exception of Pluto, the other planets in the solar system move
in planes nearly parallel to the ecliptic plane, and thus the whole solar
system lies roughly in one plane. If we surround the solar system by an
imaginary celestial sphere, the hemispheres above and below the
Figure 4.4 Srimad Bhdgavatam
(5.21.2) compares the upper and
lower hemispheres of Brahmanda
with the two parts of “nispavaa
type of pulse or bean, classed as a
dicotyledon with two halves. The
space between the two halves
corresponds to Antariksa. (Com¬
pare with Figure 4.1, p. 83.)



4.3 The Planetary Orbits in 3-D 91
plane of the solar system are therefore nearly empty.
The Bhagavatam 5.21.2 makes a similar statement. It compares the
universe (called Brahmanda or Brahma’s egg) with a spherical bean
seed that divides in two halves, like the mung bean seed in the
illustration. In such a seed, the embryo lies in the narrow space
between the two hemispherical halves, and in the Brahmanda, Bhu
mandala and the planetary orbits are similarly located in a narrow
space between two hemispheres.
As we pointed out above, the sphere of the Brahmanda contains
Bhu-mandala and a thin cylinder of adjoining space, called Antariksa,
which in this analogy corresponds to the space between the two halves
of the bean. The orbits of the planets are assigned to a series of levels
in Antariksa, as shown in Table 3.5 (p. 68). These levels lie between
Bhu-mandala and Dhruvaloka, which marks the upper limit of
Antariksa.
The 3-D interpretation of Bhu-mandala should be compared with
the planisphere interpretation, given in Chapter 3. The heights listed
in Table 3.5 have features that fit both the planisphere interpretation
and the 3-D interpretation.
For example, the fact that planetary heights extend on only one
side of Bhu-mandala is a feature we might expect to see in the
planisphere interpretation or in an astrolabe. The actual planetary
orbits are not parallel, but are intersecting planes slightly tilted with
respect to one another.
Then again, the numerical values of the planetary heights are
irrelevant to the planisphere interpretation, but they can be under¬
stood in terms of the 3-D interpretation. They agree roughly with the
maximum distances that the planets move from the ecliptic plane in the
course of their orbits. This is explained in Section 4.7.
The heights of the planets also play a role in the system of fourteen
worlds (lokas in Sanskrit) that include Bhu-mandala and lie above and
below it in the Brahmanda. This hierarchical system of worlds is
connected with the demigods, and it is discussed in Section 6.2.
In brief, the planets in the solar system orbit nearly in one plane,
and the planets in the Brahmanda orbit nearly in one plane within An¬
tariksa. Thus the Brahmanda, bisected by Bhu-mandala and Antariksa,
is strikingly similar to the solar system placed within a celestial sphere.



92 4. The Solar System in Three Dimensions
4.4 THE ORBITAL MAP
The Bhagavatam equates the outer diameter of Bhu-mandala
with the diameter of the universe, or Brahmanda. But what concep¬
tion of the “universe” is intended? One way of answering this is to
study the sizes assigned to Bhu-mandala and its subdivisions in the
Bhagavatam. The most striking feature of these sizes is that they agree
nicely with the size of the solar system, as given by modern astronomy.
We can see this by comparing the sizes of some key features of
Bhu-mandala with a variety of distances within the universe of modern
astronomy. Table 2.1 (p. 22) gives the radii of all of the circular features
of Bhu-mandala, and Figure 4.5, below, shows their relative sizes.
To make a comparison with modern data, we must know the length
of the yojana, the unit used to express distances in the Bhagavatam.
Over the centuries, there has been a great deal of variation in the
length of the yojana, but eight miles/yojana is a commonly cited value
and it is used in the translation of the Bhagavatam that we consulted
in this study (Bhaktivedanta, 1982). We will therefore begin by using
this value.
We see from the list in Table 4.1 that the features of Bhu-mandala
are much too large for the earth globe and much too small for inter
Sapta-dvipa (1-15)
radius of
Figure 4.5 The circular features of Bhu-mandala, drawn to scale. The rings on the
left are collectively called Sapta-dvipa, and they are a subset of Bhu-mandala,
which is shown on the right.



4.4 The Orbital Map 93
stellar distances within the Milky Way. But they line up nicely with
distances in the solar system. Thus the pairs of numbers marked
“compare” in the table are of the same order of magnitude, but the
smallest of these numbers is four orders of magnitude higher than the
earth’s diameter. Likewise, the largest is four orders of magnitude
smaller than the smallest stellar distance.
Bhu-mandala agrees with the solar system in scale. We can see this
in Figure 4.6, in which the Brahmanda is compared with the solar

94 4. The Solar System in Three Dimensions
system, using eight miles per yojana. The angle of view here is 75° from
the vertical (perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic), and vertical
distances have been multiplied by three for better visibility. We see
that the solar system out to Uranus corresponds closely to the thin
cylinder of space called Antariksa, in which the Bhagavatam places the
planetary orbits. Thus the thickness of Antariksa roughly matches the
vertical displacements of the tilted planetary orbits, and the radius of
Antariksa matches the radius of the orbit of Uranus.
The match with Uranus could, perhaps, be put down to coinci¬
dence. Of greater interest is the fact that the inner ring structure of
Bhu-mandala also matches the planetary orbits of the five traditional
visible planets, Mercury,Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.
Consider a typical diagram of the solar system, projected on the
ecliptic plane (Figure 4.7). We see a rough correspondence between
the dense cluster of the orbits of the inner planets (Mercury through
Mars) and the inner system of Sapta-dvipa in Bhu-mandala. (This
corresponds with the first order of magnitude comparison in Table
4.1.) There is also a rough agreement between the orbits of Saturn and
Figure 4.7 The solar system, compared with Bhu-mandala. The scale assumes
eight miles per yojana.



4.4 The Orbital Map 95
Jupiter and the two Bhu-mandala circles lying outside of Sapta-dvlpa
—the outer boundary of the “inhabited region” (Loka) and the circu¬
lar Lokaloka mountain. (This corresponds to the second comparison.)
It is noteworthy that Saturn’s orbit lines up with the Lokaloka
mountain. This circular feature is stated in the Bhagavatarn 5.20.37 to
be the outer limit of the luminaries, and Saturn is the outermost planet
visible to the naked eye. Thus we may tentatively recognize a correla¬
tion between the orbits of the known planets of antiquity, Mercury
through Saturn, and the illuminated region of Bhu-mandala.
Of course, Bhu-mandala is earth-centered. In contrast, the orbits
of the planets are centered on the sun. How, then, can they be
compared with earth-centered features of Bhu-mandala?
The solution is to express the orbits of the planets in geocentric
(earth-centered) form. Although modern astronomy treats these or¬
bits as heliocentric (sun-centered), they can be expressed in relation to
any desired center of observation, including the earth (see Appendix
4). When this is done, the sun and moon directly orbit the earth, and

the other planets orbit the sun. Historically, this form of earth
centered model was proposed by the famous sixteenth-century Danish
astronomer, Tycho Brahe, who regarded it as a matter of absolute
motion. Here, of course, we introduce the geocentric model as an
expression of relative point of view.
In nineteenth-century India, Sri Tiruvenkata Ramanuja Jlyar
Swami aligned a Tychonic, earth-centered solar system with Bhu
mandala in the same way that we are doing here (see Figure 4.8).
Although he may well have done this under Western influence, it is
noteworthy that this interpretation of Bhu-mandala was considered
appropriate by an Indian traditionalist.
The general form of a geocentric orbit is shown in Figure 4.9, using
Mercury as an example. The looping curve of the planet’s geocentric
orbit lies between two boundary curves, marked A and B in the figure.
If we continue plotting the orbit for a long enough time, it completely
fills in the donut-shaped area between these two curves. The boundary
curves each have two turning points: the point of closest approach to
the earth and the point of greatest distance from the earth. These
points can be used to quantitatively compare the planetary orbits with
the circular features of Bhu-mandala.
We used the ephemeris programs of Duffett-Smith (1985) to com¬
pute the geocentric orbits of the five planets, Mercury through Saturn,
projected onto the ecliptic plane. To compare these orbits with the



4.4 The Orbital Map 97
features of Bhu-mandala, we first converted them from miles to yoja
nas. Since the yojana is not exactly defined, we allowed it to vary in
value. We used 1 yojana = y miles, where we allowed y to vary from 1
to 16, an interval covering the known historical range of possible
yojana lengths. Then we superimposed the orbits on a map of Bhu
mandala and observed the results.
For the commonly cited value of y = 8 miles, we saw that the pattern
of Bhu-mandala tended to match the geocentric solar system out to
Saturn even more closely than it matched the heliocentric solar sys¬
tem. If we examine the orbits of Mercury, Venus, and Mars, we see that
each orbit seems to go from a perigee near one circular feature of
Sapta-dvipa, to an apogee near another circular feature. The apogee
of Saturn and the perigee of Jupiter also line up with the boundary
circles of Kancambhumi. The agreement is rough for 8 miles/yojana,
but it becomes quite striking if we shift to about 8.5 miles/yojana.
To properly evaluate these orbital alignments, we must consider
whether or not a unique yojana length y gives good alignments and, if
so, how y is to be determined. If many different yojana lengths did just
y miles

mandala lines up with planetary orbits at y miles/yojana. The yojana length y ranges
over one to sixteen miles, an interval that encompasses nearly all known variants
of the yojana.



98 4. The Solar System in Three Dimensions
as well, that would be an indication that these alignments are simply
coincidences that naturally arise when sets of circles are compared.
To find out whether or not there is a unique, optimal y, we need to
define a measure of goodness of fit, G(y). This is done in Appendix 5.
In Figure 4.10, G(y) is plotted as a function of y, which is allowed to
range from one to sixteen miles. We can see that the curve has a pro

nounced peak at 8.534 miles. This length of the yojana is singled out
as optimal, and there are no notable peaks for any other yojana lengths.
To check this result, we also defined another goodness of fit
function, C(y), which is discussed in Appendix 6. This has a pro¬
nounced peak at 8.489 miles, and this differs by 0.53% from the yojana
length obtained from G(y). C(y) is also plotted in the above illustra¬
tion. Although it is based on a completely different approach to orbital
correlations than G(y), it corroborates what we see with G(y).
Table 4.2 shows how the geocentric orbits of the five planets and
the sun compare with Bhu-mandala features (N), using an optimal yo¬
jana length of 8.489 miles. The error percentages in the table are
defined as follows: A turning point falling inside Bhu-mandala and
outside Jambudvlpa must lie in the annular region between two Bhu
mandala circles. Its distance from the closest circle, divided by the
distance between the two circles and multiplied by one hundred, is the
error percentage. This measures how close the turning point is to a
Bhu-mandala circle. (A modified definition is used for points falling
within Jambudvlpa or outside Bhu-mandala.)
The orbital turning points are calculated using a modern ephem
eris program for the epoch of a.d. 500, using 8.489 miles/yojana. All

to 15 (the outer edge of Svadudaka, the Fresh Water Ocean). Feature 15 is the outer
boundary of the system of seven dvipas and oceans. A curious feature of the orbit
of Mars is that it partially crosses over the outer boundary of Krauncadvipa. The
Bhagavatam may refer to this indirectly, since it states in verse 5.20.19 that Mount
Kraunca in Krauncadvipa was attacked by Karttikeya, the regent of Mars.
distance figures are in thousands of yojanas, and the feature radii are
as given in the Bhagavatam (see Table 2.1 on p. 22).
In Table 4.2, we see a tendency for the perigees and apogees of
planets to align closely with Bhu-mandala circles, although this corre¬
lation is not perfect.
In the case of Mercury, the error percentages for the perigee and
apogee are about 8% and 4%, respectively. Thus the inner boundary
of Mercury’s orbit swings in and nearly grazes feature 10 in Table 2.1,
and its outer boundary swings out and nearly grazes feature 13.
For Venus, the perigee and apogee are, respectively, within about
6% of feature 8 and 1% of feature 14.
Mars does not do as well. Its perigee and apogee come within 30%
and 25% of features 9 and 15, although its third turning point (apogee
in the Table 4.2) comes within 4% of feature 15.

Uranus is invisible to

The perigee of Jupiter falls within 3% of feature 16, and its apo¬
gee falls within 35% of the same feature. Likewise, the apogee of
Saturn falls within 4% of feature 17, the Lokaloka Mountain, and its
perigee falls within 45% of the same feature.
Let use pause for a moment and see whether or not these results
could be simply products of chance. We have just listed ten apogees
and perigees as percentages. These numbers add up to 161, and each
number must fall in the interval from 0 to 50%. If ten numbers were
picked at random in this interval, the probability that they sum to 161
or less comes to about 3.3%. This crude analysis is not sufficient to
show that Table 4.2 contains a statistically significant pattern, but it
does suggest that this possibility is worth investigating. A detailed
statistical analysis is carried out in Appendix 7 and reported below
under Conclusions.
We include the sun in Table 4.2 as a special case. The sun’s geo¬
centric orbit is different from that of the planets, in that it is produced
by a single heliocentric motion, rather than two. It therefore has only
two turning points, the sun’s perigee and apogee, which are nearly
equal to one another. The perigee falls 44% higher than feature 11, and

the apogee falls 44% lower than feature 12. Thus the mean of the sun’s
apogee and perigee lies almost exactly halfway across the ocean
spanning features 11 and 12. (This is 10,950 = (9,350+12,550)/2 thou¬
sand yojanas.)
In Figure 4.16, the boundary curves of the sun and Mercury
through Mars are plotted together, without the overlapping curves of
the orbits themselves. This gives an overview of the orbit correlations
for these planets.
Finally, for the sake of completeness we include the orbit of Ura¬
nus (Figure 4.17) and the orbit of Ceres (Figure 4.18), the largest
asteroid. The orbits of Neptune and Pluto lie outside the limits of
Bhu-mandala and are not considered. To see if Ceres was unique, we
examined the orbits of 141 main-belt asteriods. These showed some
statistical scatter, but like Ceres, their orbits tended to fill out region
16 (Loka, or “inhabited land”), while overlapping region 15 (Svadudaka).
4.4.1 Conclusions
In Appendix 7 we propose the null hypothesis that the author of
the Bhagavatam had no access to correct planetary distances, and
therefore all apparent correlations between Bhu-mandala features



4.4 The Orbital Map 105
and planetary distances are simply coincidental. However, analysis
shows that the observed correlations are, in fact, highly improbable,
and this suggests that advanced knowledge of planetary astronomy
may lie behind the Bhagavatam.
If this is so, when did this knowledge originate and how did it come
to be incorporated into the text? Unfortunately, it is difficult to give a
definite answer to this question, since we know very little about the
origin of the Bhagavatam. Hardy (1983) attributes the Bhagavatam to
ninth-century South India on linguistic and literary grounds, but it is
hard to say where or when specific information in the text may have
originated. Thus OTlaherty remarks that, “since the Epics and Puranas
represent an oral tradition that was constantly revised over a period of
several thousand years, a passage actually composed in the twelfth
century A.D. may represent a surprisingly accurate preservation of a
myth handed down since the twelfth century B.C.—or a completely
original retelling of that myth” (O’Flaherty, 1975, p. 16).
References in the text to the zodiac, with the vernal equinox in the
beginning of Aries (Mesa), suggest input from the Jyotisa Sastras,
Indian astronomical texts that are generally traced to Hellenistic
Greek sources (Pingree, 1976). However, the Bhagavatam presents
astronomical information in a way that is quite different from the
Jyotisa Sastras, and thus it appears to be connected with a different
astronomical tradition. Of course, the Jyotisa Sastras, in line with
Greek astronomy, make the distances to the planets much smaller than
they really are.
Cosmological presentations similar to that of the Bhagavatam are
found in other Puranas, in the Mahabharata, and in Jain and Buddhist
texts. The Jain and Buddhist cosmologies are particularly complex,
and they seem to be imaginative elaborations of themes originating in
earlier Hindu cosmology.
Puranic cosmology is generally similar to that of the Bhagavatam,
with some variations in nomenclature and in quantitative dimensions.
From a survey of Puranas, we concluded that many Puranic presenta¬
tions of Bhu-mandala appear to be garbled and incomplete (see Sec¬
tion 2.3). Of the texts we examined, only the Bhagavatam gives a
complete and consistent account of the dimensions of the different
features.
If the dimensions given in the Bhagavatam do, in fact, represent



106 4. The Solar System in Three Dimensions
realistic planetary distances based on human observation, then we
must postulate that Bhagavata astronomy preserves material from
an earlier, and presently unknown, period of scientific development.
Other texts would then represent elaborations of material from
this earlier period, with varying degrees of divergence from the
original.
Thus, if the orbital alignments are not purely coincidental, some
people in the past must have had accurate values for the dimensions of
the planetary orbits. In modern history, this information has become
available only since the development of high-quality telescopes in the
last two hundred years. Accurate values of planetary distances were
not known by Hellenistic astronomers such as Claudius Ptolemy, nor
are they to be found in the medieval Jyotisa Sdstras of India. If this
information was known, it must have been acquired by some unknown
civilization that flourished in the distant past.
The relative proportions of the planetary orbits can be obtained
from Kepler’s laws using naked eye observations, and Kepler formu¬
lated these laws without the aid of the telescope. Indeed, Kepler’s laws
arose from the work of only two astronomers, Kepler himself and
Tycho Brahe, who provided Kepler’s observational data. Thus it is
possible that the proportions of the solar system may have been
worked out in ancient times without the use of the telescope. Even this,
however, implies the existence of a society inclined to support and
nurture such investigations.
Although the hypothesis of an unknown, scientifically advanced
civilization is radical, it is supported by additional evidence. Section 4.5
shows that the yojana length obtained by optimizing the two fitness
measures is confirmed by an independent analysis which relates the
yojana to the dimensions of the earth and to units of length used in the
ancient Mediterranean world. This analysis yielded 8.59 miles as one
of a pair of ancient yojana lengths, and this agrees well with the figures
of 8.49 and 8.53 miles obtained by optimizing the orbit correlations.
It is therefore noteworthy that the scholar Livio Stecchini has
shown that ancient Egyptian units were part of a scientific system of
measures based on accurate measurements of latitude in ancient
times. His findings are corroborated by the work of scholars such as
A. E. Berriman and Schwa Her de Lubicz (see Appendix 8).
Whatever the source of the Bhagavatam’s astronomical knowl



4.4 The Orbital Map 107
edge may be, it appears to have become lost or obscured by the
medieval period, when the current text was supposedly written. The
commentaries on the Bhagavatam do not explicitly acknowledge the
role of Bhu-mandala as a map of the solar system or its role as a
planisphere map of the earth. If the latter were an import from
Ptolemaic astronomy in the early Middle Ages, then one would expect
to find it explicitly recognized by medieval commentators, but this is
not the case.
Medieval Indian astronomers of the Jyotisa school do not seem to
have been aware that Puranic cosmology refers to the earth as a globe.
Since they lacked realistic values for planetary distances, they could
not know that the large sizes of features in Bhu-mandala correlate well
with distances in the solar system. Thus Bhaskaracarya, the eleventh
century author of the Jyotisa text Siddhanta-siromani (Wilkinson,
1861), said that he could not reconcile the relatively small diameter of
the earth, which he deduced from simple measurements, with the
immense magnitude attributed to the earth by the Pauranikas (the
followers of the Purdnas). Although the extant Purdnas are generally
attributed to the Middle Ages by scholars, this comment adds to the
impression that their cosmological content was not understood during
that time period, and it must date back to an earlier time.
Although the Jyotisa Sdstras do not have good values for orbital
distances, the Surya-siddhanta does contain accurate values for the
diameters of the planets (see Appendix 10). This information is lodged
incongruously in the text of the Surya-siddhanta as though it were a
fossil remnant of a previous stage of advanced scientific knowledge.
The hypothesis of lost scientific knowledge should be pursued by
seeking other evidence of an earlier astronomical school. However, we
should also mention another hypothesis based on the traditions sur¬
rounding the Bhagavatam itself. This is that the text is a product of
divine inspiration, and therefore it may encode levels of meaning not
understood even by the author himself. According to this hypothesis,
the Bhagavatam may contain information that was unknown to human
society in the period of its composition, but which can be discerned in
the text now on the basis of our more advanced scientific knowledge.
In this case, a simple model of the ecliptic, which could have been based
on Greek astronomy, is supplemented by information reflecting ad¬
vanced knowledge of planetary distances.



108 4. The Solar System in Three Dimensions
4.5 THE LENGTH OF THE YOJANA
In this section we examine how the Puranic distance unit called
the yojana relates to ancient systems of measures, and in the course
of this, we find evidence that the yojana length computed in Section
4.4 was actually used historically. Two appendices give supporting
evidence. In Appendix 8, we investigate the empirical basis for the
claims of some scholars that ancient Egyptian and Near Eastern
societies had scientific definitions of weights and measures based on
latitude. In Appendix 9, we cite scholarly studies of ancient mathemat¬
ics to show that the mathematical tools for scientific metrology were
available in ancient times.
We begin with a common misconception regarding systems of
weights and measures. An encyclopedia article states that in early
times distance was defined by the breadth of the palm or hand, and the
length from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger (the cubit). The
article goes on to say, “Such standards were both changeable and
perishable, and only within modern times have definite unchanging
standards of measurement been adopted” (Microsoft Encarta).
The Middle Ages certainly saw many conflicting and poorly
defined standards of weights and measures. But exact standards of
measurement are not solely a modern invention.
Consider this example. In tenth-century England, King Athelstan
decreed that the king’s girth, in which the king’s peace is in force,
should extend from the royal residence for a distance of three miles,
three furlongs, nine acres, nine feet, nine palms, and nine barleycorns
(Stecchini, 1971, p. 344). This sounds quaint. But it defines a circle with
a diameter of 36,500 feet—almost exactly Vio of a degree of latitude in
southern England. (Here an acre of 66x660 square feet is used as a
linear unit of 66 feet.)
4.5.1 Measuring with Latitude
To define a unit of length exactly, it is natural to use latitude as a
standard, because latitude derives from the size of the earth, which is
constant and can be measured astronomically. So if a fire or invasion
destroys the standard measuring rod stored in some government build¬
ing, astronomical readings can be used to restore the lost standard.

sun’s rays sun’s rays
Figure 4.19 The Greek astronomer Eratosthenes noted that when the sun was
directly overhead at Syene, its shadow marks an angle of 7.2° (exaggerated for
clarity) at Alexandria. Knowing this and the distance between Syene and Alexan¬
dria, he calculated the circumference of the earth.
Of course, it seems unlikely that accurate astronomical measure¬
ments were being made in England in the days of King Athelstan. But
if we look into the history of weights and measures, we find that
distances were gauged in terms of latitude in ancient times, and
medieval societies inherited many exact standards of measurement.
These included standard volumes defined as length cubed and stan¬
dard weights defined by filling such a volume with water.
The Greek astronomer Eratosthenes is usually credited with being
the first to measure the size of the earth by observing latitudes. Ele is
said to have noted that the sun, when directly overhead at Syene at the
Tropic of Cancer, casts a shadow of 7.2° at Alexandria. Knowing the
distance between Syene and Alexandria, he could compute the length
of a degree of latitude and estimate the circumference of the earth.
But there is reason to believe that the size of the earth was known
long before Eratosthenes. Back in the nineteenth century, Pierre
Simon de Laplace observed that Eratosthenes had obtained a result



110 4. The Solar System in Three Dimensions
much better than his measurements, due to an apparently fortuitous
cancellation of errors. He concluded that “this astronomer had only
reproduced an ancient measure of the earth that had been executed
with great skill and whose origin had been lost” (Laplace, 1884).
The Italian scholar Livio Stecchini has given extensive evidence
that the ancient Egyptians laid out their country using latitude and
longitude (Stecchini, 1971). He argues that they had accurate knowl¬
edge of the dimensions of the earth and that such knowledge was
inherent in the design of the great pyramid at Giza. Since the great
pyramid dates to about 2500 B.C., this implies that the earth was
measured scientifically at least that long ago.
4.5.2 Defining the Yojana
Turning to India, we find a unit of distance—called the yojana
that at first glance seems as ill defined as the medieval English furlong
or foot. The yojana is stated to be four krosas of 2,000 or 1,000 dhanus
(bow-lengths) of four hastas, where a hasta of 24 ahgulas (fingers)
corresponds to a Western cubit (Burgess, 1860, p. 43). This comes to
32,000 or 16,000 hastas. If there are 1.5 feet in a cubit, then a finger
comes to 3A of an inch and the yojana comes to nine miles or 4.5 miles.
That there were at least two sizes for the yojana is upheld by the
writings of classical Indian astronomers. The fifth-century astronomer
Aryabhata used a yojana of about eight miles, and the astronomical
Figure 4.20 Mega
sthenes stated that
pillars were placed
every ten stadia along
the royal road from
Palibothra, and
Cunningham argued
that the distance from
pillar to pillar was
one krosa. This makes
ten stadia per krosa
and forty stadia per
yojana of four krosas.

text Surya-siddhanta used a yojana of roughly five miles (Sarma, 1956,
p. 83).
The first hint of the ancient history of the yojana comes from
Strabo, who describes the experiences of Megasthenes, a Greek
ambassador to India in the period following Alexander the Great.
Strabo cites Megasthenes as saying that along the royal road to the
Indian capital of Palibothra (thought to be near modern Patna), pillars
were set up every ten stadia (Cunningham, 1871, p. 484). The British
scholar Alexander Cunningham argues that the pillars marked an
interval of one krosa. Since there are traditionally four krosas per
yojana, this implies forty stadia per yojana. Stecchini gives 400 cubits
per stadium, and this implies 16,000 cubits per yojana.
Since the smaller of the two definitions for the yojana assigns it
16,000 hastas, we can tentatively identify the hasta, or Indian cubit,
with the Greek cubit. This unit is well known, and it enables us to
compute the length of the yojana. The Greek cubit is 462.42 millime¬
ters. This gives us a small yojana of about 4.6 miles, in rough agreement
with texts such as the Surya-siddhanta and Puranic definitions.
Stecchini points out that the stadium was defined as V6oo of a degree
of latitude (Stecchini, 1971, p. 314). This would mean that there are fif¬
teen small yojanas per degree. Likewise, there are sixty krosas per
degree, or one krosa per minute.
The above illustration shows what is involved conceptually in
measuring latitude in the northern hemisphere (leaving out the tech¬
nical details required for highly accurate measurements). Imagine that

you are standing on level ground, facing north. Sight along the
protractor to the celestial north pole, as shown. (In some historical
periods, this point in the sky is conveniently marked by a polestar
Polaris at present.) The angle L from the horizon to the celestial north
pole is your latitude. This angle is 0° at the equator and grows to 90°
at the geographical north pole.
The length of a degree of latitude is the distance a person would
have to travel northward for his latitude to increase by 1°. On a perfect
sphere, this distance would be the same at all latitudes. But the earth
is slightly flattened at the poles, and it bulges at the equator. This
makes for a degree of latitude slightly smaller at the equator than
further north.
Stecchini noted that the Greek stadium is V6oo of a degree of
latitude at Mycenae in Greece, and he argued that it was deliberately
defined this way in ancient times. It can be argued that to define the
yojana in India, the degree of latitude at the equator was used. This
means that the hasta should be 460.7 millimeters instead of 462.4
millimeters (and the yojana would still be about 4.6 miles). We will see
below why this fine distinction is important.
At first glance, the yojana of 32,000 hastas should be twice as long
as this, or about 9.2 miles. But there is reason to think that these two
yojanas use different standards for the hasta.
Hiuen Thsang, a Buddhist pilgrim who visited India in the seventh
century, wrote of yojanas in terms of a Chinese unit of measure called
the li. He reported that a yojana consisted of forty li according to

Indian tradition, but the measure in customary use equaled thirty li,
and the measure given in sacred texts was only sixteen (Burgess, 1860,
p. 43). The li has taken on many values during China’s history. But
using values for the Thang dynasty (when Hiuen Thsang lived), we can
compute that the yojana of sixteen li matches the small yojana of 4.6
miles.
Could the yojana of thirty li match the larger yojana of 32,000
hastasl If it does, then the larger yojana has to use a slightly smaller
hasta,30/32 as long as the hasta in the shorter yojana. Multiplying our
hasta of 460.7 millimeters by 30/32, we get a smaller hasta of 431.9
millimeters. The larger yojana of 32,000 hastas then comes to 8.59
miles. At the equator, that is Vs of a degree of latitude.
In the illustration above, the short and Iongyojanas are plotted in



114 4. The Solar System in Three Dimensions
minutes of latitude at the equator. The krosa of the short yojana is one
minute of latitude, and the modern nautical mile is defined in the same
way. Thus the short yojana is four minutes of latitude and the long yojana
is seven and a half minutes of latitude.
In Section 4.4, above, we point out that the geocentric orbits of the
planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn align closely with
the dimensions of the circular features of Bhu-mandala. To align
planetary orbits with these features we need to be able to convert the
yojanas used in the Bhagavatam into the miles or kilometers of modern
astronomy. The alignment of orbits and features works well if we
assume about eight and a half miles per yojana.
To compare orbits with the structure of Bhu-mandala, modern
ephemeris programs were used for orbital calculations. We ran these
calculations for the epoch of about A.D. 500, based on scholarly
estimates for the age of the Bhagavatam. (However, this date is not
important in the analysis because the calculated results turn out to be
nearly independent of the epoch used, from 3000 B.C. to A.D. 2000.)
The calculations show that the planetary orbits align closely with
dvipas in Bhu-mandala at a value of 8.49 to 8.53 miles per yojana. This
is very close to the figure of 8.59 miles based on the hasta of 431.9
millimeters. So the value of the yojana we get by historical research is
confirmed by completely independent calculations having to do with
planetary orbits and the astronomy of the Bhagavatam.
4.5.3 Familiar Numbers
As explained above, we get the larger yojana of 32,000 hastas (and
V8 of a degree of latitude) by using a hasta of 431.9 millimeters. This can
be rounded off to 432, a familiar number in Sanskrit literature. An
example is 432,000, the number of years in Kali-yuga. In Section 8.4,
we show that this number has a long history in Indian and ancient Near
Eastern traditions.
One might think that it is wrong to attribute any significance to a
figure of 432 millimeters, when the metric system is a recent invention.
But it turns out that the appearance of this familiar number may not be
simply coincidental.
First of all, the meter itself derives from a measurement of latitude.
The meter (one thousand millimeters) was originally defined in 1791



4.5 The Length of the Yojana 115
as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the north pole
through the meridian of Paris. That distance has been remeasured
since then, but the change amounts to a tiny fraction of a percent.
So accepting for the larger yojana a hasta of 432 millimeters, we find
that this hasta comes very close to 108 ten-billionths of the circumference
of the earth on a great circle through the poles. (This is because 432 =
4 x 108, and there are four quadrants from equator to pole in the complete
circumference.) Here Figure 4.24 shows one such great circle.
Another 108 comes up if we consider the mean diameter of the
earth, 7917.5 miles, or 1728.5 “small yojanas.” This is close to 1728, or
16 x 108. (This is reminiscent of the 1,728,000 years of Krta-yuga, the
first in the cycle of the four ages. See Section 8.4.)
These observations suggest a simple experiment. Try setting the
mean diameter of the earth to exactly 1,728 small yojanas of 16,000
hastas. Suppose that 3%2 of a hasta gives a smaller hasta exactly 108 ten
billionths of the circumference of the earth through the poles. If we
multiply it all out, we find that the ratio between circumference and
mean diameter comes to 3.13967.
This ratio expresses the degree of polar flattening of the earth. If
the earth were a perfect sphere, as shown on the left of Figure 4.25, this
number would be k—the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its
diameter. This is simply c/d. In a flattened sphere, we take the ratio
between C', the circumference through the poles, and D', the average
of the many, slightly differing diameters of the flattened sphere.
Figure 4.24 The hasta of the
long yojana is equal to 108 ten
billionths of the circumference
of the earth, measured on a great
circle through the poles. Here
one polar great circle is shown.



116 4. The Solar System in Three Dimensions
s
Figure 4.25 The ratio between the circumference C and the diameter D of a circle
(shown on the left) is k = 3.1415927. Since the earth (shown on the right) is flattened
at the poles, its diameter varies. The ratio between circumference C' through the
poles and the mean diameter D' is 3.13984, within 0.006% of the value calculated
on the basis of the yojana. (The flattening of the earth is shown greatly exaggerated
for clarity.)
As it turns out, 3.13967 is within 0.006% of the actual ratio c/d ,
as calculated using modern data. That this calculation works out so
well indicates strongly that we are dealing with design rather than
coincidence.
The temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia gives evidence that the
hasta of 432 millimeters was in use in the Indian cultural area during the
medieval period. When measured by the Khmer unit of length called
the hat, the Angkor Wat complex turns out to be loaded with astro¬
nomical relationships relating to the naksatras, the sun, and the moon
(Snodgrass, 1990, pp. 217-224). This unit is 0.43454 meters, which is
within 0.6% of the hasta of 432 mm. (For a discussion of links between
astronomy and Indian temple design, see Section 2.5.)
In summary, simple arguments from the testimony of Megasthenes
and Hiuen Thsang enable us to reconstruct two closely related yojana
values. Both are precisely defined as fractions of a degree of latitude
at the equator. Both relate to the earth by multiples of 108 (namely 432
and 1,728), and this relationship gives us a very accurate estimate of
the polar flattening of the earth. Also, the length of the larger yojana
is confirmed independently by an investigation comparing modern

astronomy with the cosmology of the Bhdgavatam.
Let us return briefly to our replacement of the Greek cubit with
a slightly smaller unit linked to a degree of latitude at the equator. All
the calculations above would go through if we used the Greek cubit
directly and did not make this substitution. But the errors would be
larger. So it is preferable to match the two yojana lengths to the
equator rather than to Greece.
Curiously, we can find support for this in the design of the great
pyramid of Egypt. In 1925 an engineer named J. H. Cole made an
accurate survey of the great pyramid using up-to-date instruments.
He found that twice the perimeter is 1,842.91 meters (Stecchini, 1971,
p. 203). For comparison, a minute of latitude at the equator—or a krosa
of the small yojana—is 1,842.93 meters. In other words, the perimeter
of the great pyramid is almost exactly half a krosa. Likewise, we find
that the hasta of the small yojana goes almost exactly 500 times into
each of the sides of the pyramid.
The Greek cubit and stadium, however, fit the pyramid less closely.
(There is a 0.4% error.) So it would seem that the great pyramid was
designed using units linked to the degree of latitude at the equator.
4.5.4 Wise Ancients
If the yojana was exactly defined as a fraction of the equatorial
degree of latitude, then the people who defined it must have known



118 4. The Solar System in Three Dimensions
that the earth is a globe. Indeed, they appear to have understood the
dimensions of the earth’s equatorial bulge.
Who were these people, and when did they live? The evidence
considered here puts them at least as far back as the time of the great
pyramid in Egypt—a time when Egyptians supposedly believed that
the earth is flat. Turning to India, we find evidence that the apparent
flat earth of the Bhagavatam represents a sophisticated understanding
of the earth and the solar system. The correlation between planetary
orbits and features of Bhu-mandala implies an advanced knowledge of
astronomical distances that supposedly did not exist until recently.
Although one may doubt, on historical grounds, that this correlation
could be significant, it is corroborated by the evidence linking the
yojana with ancient measurements of latitudes and the size of the earth.
The Bhagavatam speaks of an ancient world civilization. Although
the evidence we have looked at here does not prove that such a
civilization existed, it does indicate that some people in the distant past
attained an unexpectedly high level of scientific knowledge. Whether
they lived in the East, the West, or both is hard to say. We do know that
some evidence for this civilization is preserved in texts from India such
as the Bhagavatam, and other evidence may be found in ancient ruins
of the West. Perhaps there was an advanced civilization that was
worldwide in its influence.
It is worth our while to be on the alert for other evidence that may
shed light on this hidden chapter in human history. One body of evi¬
dence is found in the study of ancient weights and measures without
reference to the yojana. This is discussed in Appendix 8.
4.6 HELIOCENTRISM IN THE PURANAS
Although the Bhagavatam does not say that the planets orbit the
sun, it does contain references giving the sun a central position in the
universe. Indeed, from the point of view of modern astronomy, it could
be said that the Bhagavatam goes too far in placing the sun in the
center, both in position and in importance. The following are examples
of “sun-centered” statements in the Bhagavatam:
1. Verse 5.20.43 says “anda-madhya-gatah suryo” meaning that
the sun travels in the middle of the universal egg (anda). It also



4.6 Heliocentrism in the Puranas 119
says that the distance between the sun and the globe of the
universe (anda-golayoh) is 250,000,000 yojanas, and the sun is in
the middle (madhye).
Visvanatha CakravartI Thakura interprets this verse as
referring to the vertical direction (perpendicular to Bhu
mandala), since in the plane of Bhu-mandala, the sun moves in
its geocentric orbit and it therefore can’t be fixed in the center
of the Brahmanda.
The ratio between the outermost limit of this orbit and the
universal sphere is 250,000/15,750, or roughly sixteen. (This
orbit has a radius no greater than 15,750,000 yojanas, which is
the radius of Manasottara Mountain and the length of the axle
of the sun’s chariot).
However, VIraraghava is not deterred by this point. In his
commentary on this text, he fixes the sun precisely in the center
of the egg:
Fixing the sun. the measure of the egg is to be stated. In the middle,
between the sun and the egg is 25 koti yojanas. That means, fixing
the sun, from the sun to the egg-wall is 25 koti yojanas, up, down,
and sideways.
Tikewise, the commentator Vijayadhvaja says that, “in the
middle, between the sun and the egg-ball in all directions
together, there should be 25 koti yojanas.” Here he is referring
to the ten directions, of which two are up and down and the other
eight point sideways (E, NE, N, NW, W, SW, S, SE).
2. Verse 5.21.3 says that the sun is in the middle (madhya-gatah) of
Antariksa. The term Antariksa literally means the space be¬
tween earth and heaven (see Section 4.3), and it is technically the
space between the plane of Bhu-mandala (earth) and a parallel
plane 3,800,000 yojanas above Bhu-mandala (the beginning of
Svargaloka or heaven).
Since the sun is said to orbit 100,000 yojanas above Bhu
mandala, it is not precisely in the middle of Antariksa. Thus
there appears to be some tension between the idea of the sun
being in the center and the description of the sun’s geocentric
orbit.



120 4. The Solar System in Three Dimensions
3. Verse 5.20.45 says that the sun divides the directions, suggesting
that it occupies a central place. The verse goes on to say that our
understanding of the universe depends on the sun, and 5.20.46
says that all living beings are dependent on the sun.
Other Puranas also include statements ascribing central impor¬
tance to the sun. For example, the Vayu Purana states, “Thus the bright
and sparkling solar zone is described. It is the support and source of
origin of the stars, planets and the Moon. All these, the stars, the Moon,
and the planets should be known to have originated from the Sun”
(Tagare, 1987, p. 364). Modern astronomy would trace the origin of the
moon and planets to the sun’s primordial gaseous disk. Of course, the
Vayu Purana is too heliocentric when it ascribes the origin of the stars
to the sun.
Again, the Vayu Purana says that, “There is no doubt that the
entire universe, all the worlds including Devas, Asuras and human
beings, have their roots in the Sun” (Tagare, 1987, p. 365).
4.7 THE MEANING OF PLANETARY HEIGHTS
In Table 3.5 (p. 68), we listed the heights of different celestial
bodies above Bhu-mandala in yojanas, as given in the Bhagavatam.
These heights make sense in a planisphere model as successive layers
in an astrolabelike arrangement (see Section 3.4). The specific magni¬
tudes assigned to these heights are irrelevant from the point of view of
such a model. But it turns out that these magnitudes are meaningful if
we interpret Bhu-mandala as the ecliptic plane.
Let us sum up the arguments for this interpretation. In Section 4.4,
we pointed out that the very large sizes of the dvipas of Bhu-mandala
are not appropriate for the planisphere model. But they do make sense
if we interpret Bhu-mandala as a map of the solar system. It turns out
that the heights of the planets above Bhu-mandala also make sense if
we interpret them as part of the solar system map.
The solar system is nearly flat. Therefore, in comparison with the
size of their orbits, the planets move relatively small distances away
from the plane of the ecliptic. If we surround the solar system by a
sphere, we find that it fits into a thin cylinder of space along a plane
dividing the sphere into two halves.



4.7 The Meaning of Planetary Heights 121
We find a similar picture if we turn to Bhu-mandala. In Section 4.3,
we showed that Bhu-mandala can be interpreted as a plane parallel to
the ecliptic and close to it. We also pointed out that the heights of the
planets above Bhu-mandala are small, compared with the diameter of
Bhu-mandala (which equals the diameter of the Brahmanda). Thus,
according to the Bhagavatam, the planetary orbits fit into a narrow
band which divides the Brahmanda into two hemispheres.
Since Bhu-mandala represents the plane of the ecliptic, the
heights listed in the Bhagavatam should be compared to the furthest
distances the planets move perpendicular to the ecliptic plane. These
distances are listed in Table 4.3, below, under Height (modern). We
added a hundred thousand yojanas to compensate for the fact that the
sun in the ecliptic plane lies a hundred thousand yojanas from Bhu
mandala. For comparison, we list the heights given in the Bhagavatam
under Height (Bhagavatam). We also list the mean distances of the
sun and planets from the earth, according to modern astronomy. The
units in all cases are converted to thousands of yojanas, using 8.489
mileslyojana.
We see that for the sun, Venus, Mercury, Mars, and Jupiter, the
height listed in the Bhagavatam roughly agrees with the modern
height. For Saturn, the modern height is about four times too large, but
it is still much closer to the Bhagavatam height than the mean distance,
which is about seventy-four times too large.

122 4. The Solar System in Three Dimensions
Thus the heights listed in the Bhdgavatam give a simple estimate
of the maximum movement of the planets away from the ecliptic
plane.The flatness of the solar system is indicated by the small magni¬
tudes of the Bhdgavatam heights in comparison with the radial dimen¬
sions of the circular features of Bhu-mandala. Thus, the Bhdgavatam’s
planetary heights are a three-dimensional part of the solar system map
represented in two dimensions by Bhu-mandala. However, the fact
that the heights are all on one side of the ecliptic, whereas planets move
on both sides, is a feature that makes sense only in the planisphere
interpretation. We propose that the Bhdgavatam is giving a composite
presentation of both interpretations.



The Earth and Local Geography
5.1 THE HIMALAYAS AND SURROUNDING LANDS
A study of the Puranic geography of Jambudvipa indicates that
Jambudvipa can be interpreted as a map of a large region of south
central Asia. This region extends from India in the south to Siberia in
the north, and from western China in the east to the Caspian Sea in the
west. It is centered approximately on the Pamir Mountains, which
Figure 5.1 The mountains and varsas of Jambudvipa can be identified with
mountain chains and valleys in a region of south-central Asia, extending from
Northern India to Siberia.
123



124 5. The Earth and Local Geography
correspond to Mount Meru. This interpretation is based on the
identification of sites in Asia with geographical features of Jambudvipa,
and an extensive treatment is given in (Ali, 1966).
We begin with Bharata-varsa. It is evident that many sites listed for
Bharata-varsa in the Bhagavatam are in India, although some identi¬
fications are doubtful, and a few Bharata-varsa features cannot be
identified. On the whole, it is clear that Bharata-varsa represents
greater India, including territories such as Pakistan and Afghanistan.
(For a detailed discussion, see Section 5.1.2, below.)
If Bharata-varsa is India, it stands to reason that the eight varsas
of Jambudvipa other than Bharata-varsa must correspond to parts of
Asia to the north, northeast, and northwest of India. Here the identi¬
fications are weaker. Nonetheless, it seems clear that the mountain
ranges centered on Mount Meru in Jambudvipa must correspond to
the extensive mountainous region north of India, beginning with the
Himalayas. In particular, Mount Meru may represent the Pamir
Mountains. (See Section 5.1.1, below, for a detailed discussion.)
Ali has tried to identify the six dvipas, Plaksadvipa through Pus
karadvipa, with various regions of the earth as we know it. However,
these identifications seem quite speculative, and we cannot put much
confidence in them. It may be that the dvipas did originally refer to
regions of irregular shape on the earth globe. Nonetheless, they do not
play that role in the Bhagavatam or in other Puranas. The dvipas’
circular shape does not fit our experience of earthly continents, but it
does make sense in an astronomical context. Whatever the original
role of the dvipas may have been, they play an astronomical role in the
existing Purdnas.
We have argued that the Bhagavatam uses the structures of Jam¬
budvipa and Bhu-mandala in several different ways, and this inevita¬
bly leads to apparent inconsistencies. For example, the following
inconsistencies arise if we look at Jambudvipa as a local map of part of
Asia:
1. In the Bhagavatam, Mount Meru clearly defines the axis around
which the stars and other celestial luminaries revolve. But people
who explored the countries on all sides of the Pamir Mountains
could not have thought that these mountains mark the north pole.



5.1 The Himalayas arid Surrounding Lands 125
These areas were well traveled, since the famous Silk Road passed
through the region north of the Pamirs. Anyone traveling in this
area could have seen that the north pole lies to their north.
2. The great size attributed to the features of Jambudvlpa in the
Bhagavatam makes it completely unrealistic as a local map of part
of Asia. For example, Bharata-varsa (India) is said in the Bhagavatam
to be 9,000 yojanas from north to south. At roughly eight miles per
yojana, this comes to 72,000 miles—nearly three times the circum¬
ference of the earth.
These inconsistencies can be resolved if we consider that Jambu¬
dvlpa is open to other, equally valid interpretations. Thus Mount Meru
plays the role of the polar axis in the planisphere interpretation of Bhu
mandala. (See Section 3.1.) There, Jambudvlpa and its surrounding
dvipas represent a stereographic projection of the earth globe, with
Mount Meru at the north pole. One of the main purposes of this
interpretation was to explain day, night, and the seasons in relation to
the motion of the sun.
The planisphere model places Bharata-varsa in the position of
India, and this is no doubt an intentional feature of the model. It also
places Uttarakuru-varsa, the most “northern” region, somewhere in
Mexico, but this may not have been consciously intended. Broadly
speaking, in the planisphere model, Jambudvlpa represents the lands
of the northern hemisphere. Jambudvlpa has also been interpreted
this way in the Jyotisa Sastras such as Surya-siddhdnta, which treats the
earth as a globe with Jambudvlpa as the northern hemisphere and
Mount Meru as the north pole.
The great size of Jambudvlpa should not be attributed to igno¬
rance on the part of the Puranic geographers. In ancient times and still
today, people regularly walked on pilgrimage from one end of India to
the other, and this certainly gave them a realistic appreciation of how
big India is. The figure of 72,000 miles requires some explanation other
than ignorance. Some have suggested that it reflects the crooked roads
of rural India, but the roads are not that bad! Our answer is that Jambu¬
dvlpa also represents a map of a heavenly region of demigods, and this
accounts for its large dimensions. (This is discussed in Section 6.1.)



126 5. The Earth and Local Geography
Alexander Cunningham remarked, “From the accounts of the
Greeks it would appear that the ancient Indians had a very accurate
knowledge of the true shape and size of their country” (Cunningham,
1871, p. 1). Cunningham cites figures given by Greek and Roman
writers for several important distances in India, and he compares them
with modern distance estimates. For example, according to Strabo,
Megasthenes “estimated the distance from the southern sea to the
Caucasus at 20,000 stadia,” or 2,298 British miles. Cunningham notes
that by direct measurement on a modern map, the distance from Cape
Comorin to the Hindu Kush (which he identifies as the Greek refer¬
ence points) is about 1,950 miles. If increased by 1le to allow for winding
roads, this comes to 2,275 miles, or within a few miles of Megasthenes’
figure (Cunningham, 1871, p. 4).
It is interesting to note that Cunningham converts stadia into miles
on the assumption that the Olympic stadium was 1/m of an equatorial
degree of latitude. This is the assumption we made when we used
Megasthenes’ testimony to estimate the length of the yojana (in
Section 4.5). Cunningham also said that the well-known inaccuracies
in Claudius Ptolemy’s map of India were partly due to the fact that
Ptolemy used an erroneous value of 500 Olympic stadia for the
equatorial degree, rather than 600. This suggests a decline in geo¬
graphical knowledge between the time of Megasthenes (third century
B.C.) and Ptolemy (second century A.D.).
We finally note that throughout the world, people have envisioned
local maps in which the cosmic axis, often represented by a mountain
or pillar, is identified with a local hill or mountain. These local maps
show many resemblances to the Puranic Jambudvipa, and this sug¬
gests that the Puranic cosmology in some form was once widely
disseminated throughout the world. (This is discussed below in
Section 5.2.)
5.1.1 Jambudvipa in Asia
The geographer S. M. Ali has offered the following set of tentative
identifications for some of the major mountain ranges of Jambudvipa
(Ali, 1966, pp. 51-53):

Ladakh-Kailash-Trans Himalayan chain
Great Himalayan range
These mountain ranges are fairly close together, and the varsas
Hiranmaya, Ramyaka, Ilavrta, Hari, and Kimpurusa are sandwiched
between them. Bharata-varsa to the south is, of course, India, and
Kuru-varsa to the north corresponds to a vast but thinly populated
area “from the Urals and the Caspian to the Yenisei and from the
Turkestan, Tien-Shan ranges to the Arctic” (Ali, 1966, p. 87).
Kuru-varsa is generally referred to as Uttarakuru-varsa (northern
Kuru land) in the Puranas and the Mahdbharata. It is apparently
mentioned by ancient western geographers. Erik Seldeslachts of Gent
University in Belgium has pointed out on the Internet that
In Greek and Latin sources Uttarakuru is rendered Ottorokora
(and variants). In the Geography of Ptolemy, Ottorokora is a city,
Ottorokoras is a river and Ottorokorai a people, all of them situated
in the southern part of Serike. Serike, which is definitely not China
as is often thought, included not only extensive parts of Central Asia
including Tibet, but very probably also Assam and adjacent areas.
It is possible that the term Uttarakuru has referred to more than
one location in Puranic geography.
Ketumala-varsa, on the western side of Mount Meru, corresponds
to extensive lands in the vicinity of the Amu Darya (Oxus) river.
According to Ali (1966, p. 97),
Ketumala signified practically the whole of the ancient Bactria which
included the whole of the present Afghan Turkestan (north of Hindukush),



128 5. The Earth and Local Geography
the lower Hari Rud Valley, the basin of Murghab Kashka system (all
south of the old bed of the Amu Darya) and the basins of the Surkhan,
Kafirnigan, Vakhsh and Yaksu rivers bounded on the north and west by
the Hissar-Zarafshan parapet and its south-western extension which
touches the Oxus near Kalif.
Bhadrasva-varsa, on the eastern side of Mount Meru, is also called
Bhadra-varsa in the Puranas. According to Ali (1966, p. 99), this region
“was identical with the basins of the Tarim and Hwang Ho rivers, i.e.,
the whole of Sinkiang and Northern China.”
5.1.2 Rivers and Mountains in Bharata-varsa
The Puranic Bharata-varsa is commonly identified as India, and
India continues to be known as Bharata today. This identification
is supported by the fact that major rivers in India are referred to in the
Puranas as being in Bharata-varsa. The accompanying map illustrates
a few of these rivers.
In addition to the Ganges, the following rivers of Bharata-varsa
are listed in the Srimad Bhagavatam 5.19.17-18. The identifications

The identifications make it clear that Bharata-varsa can be inter¬
preted as India (although this is not its only possible interpretation
see Section 6.1). Many additional identifiable rivers are mentioned in
the Markandeya and other Puranas.
Of course, by India, we do not mean the land bounded by the
present boundaries of India. The India of ancient times had different
boundaries, and in some historical periods it included the present-day

Pakistan and neighboring areas.
The Bhdgavatam also lists mountains of Bharata-varsa. In addi¬
tion to the Himalayas, which form the northern boundary of Bharata
varsa, text 5.19.16 lists the following mountains. As with the rivers, the

5.2 CROSS-CULTURAL THEMES IN COSMOLOGY
The identification of Mount Meru with an earthly mountain range
may represent a general cultural phenomenon, in which a cosmolog¬
ical structure, in this case the axis of universal rotation, is identified
with some geographical feature on the earth. In this section, we will
give many examples from around the world in which a cosmological
system broadly similar to that of the Puranas is identified with local
geography.
As we have seen, the Bhagavata Purdna describes a land called
Jambudvlpa in the middle of the lotus whorl of the Bhuloka planetary
system. In the center of this land stands the golden Surneru mountain,
which is shaped like a pillar wider at the top than at the bottom. The
city of Lord Brahma and eight cities of the planetary lords occupy the
top of this pillar. The celestial Ganges strikes Brahma’s city and cas¬
cades from Surneru in the form of four rivers flowing in the four
cardinal directions.
Mount Surneru is surrounded by four great mountains surmounted
by four gigantic trees. These include the Jambu tree after which Jam¬
budvlpa is named. Four huge lakes of milk, honey, sugarcane juice, and
pure water are located between the four mountains, and these lakes
confer mystic powers on the celestial beings who bathe in them. There
are also four celestial gardens near these lakes.
From the foot of each of the four trees, there flows a river that
either emerges from the tree itself or from the fruits of the tree. These
rivers of honey and different kinds of juice flow throughout the region
of Ilavrta-varsa surrounding Mount Surneru, and they confer freedom
from fatigue, disease, and old age on the inhabitants of that region
(Bhagavatam 5.16.5-25, 5.17.5).



5.2 Cross-cultural Themes in Cosmology 133

and dvlpas.
Stories similar to these have played an important role in the
cosmological thinking of people in many cultures (Hooper). Indeed,
the available evidence suggests that in ancient times a cosmology very
similar to that of the Bhdgavata Purana was widely distributed through¬
out the world. If this is true, then Bhdgavata cosmology is highly
relevant to our understanding of ancient history. It tells us something
about how ancient peoples understood the world, and it may tell us
something about patterns of communication linking ancient societies.
One might shrug off broad similarities between the cosmologies of
different cultures by saying that people with similar genes living in
similar environments are likely to come up with similar ideas. But
people do not inherit detailed ideas from their parents, comparable to
the web-building instincts of spiders. If certain specific ideas crop
up repeatedly in widely separated cultures, then it is natural to sur¬
mise that transcontinental communication was widespread before the
modern era.



134 5. The Earth and Local Geography
It turns out that many specific details of Bhagavata cosmology can
be found in cultures around the world. We will first discuss some of
these details and then return to the question of how they attained
world-wide distribution. Here is a partial list:
First, the earth is described as a disk surrounded by an ocean and
%
sometimes by other ring-shaped continents and oceans. There are
three worlds, upper, middle, and lower, and the earth is identified as
the middle world.
In their study of world mythology, de Santillana and von Dechend
arrived “roughly and most inaccurately” at the following conception of
the three worlds:
(a) the sky north of the Tropic of Cancer, i.e., the sky proper, domain of
the gods
(b) the ‘inhabited world’ of the zodiac between the Tropics, the domain
of the ‘living’
(c) the sky south from the Tropic of Capricorn, alias the Sweet Water
Ocean, the realm of the dead (de Santillana, 1969, p. 234).
Figure 5.4 The generic world disk found in cultures all over the world. It includes
the central continent, four directional rivers, the cosmic mountain surmounted by
the abode of the gods, the ring-ocean, upper and lower worlds, and the world¬
girdling serpent of the underworld.



5.2 Cross-cultural Themes in Cosmology 135
This general conception agrees, in particular, with the interpreta¬
tions of Bhu-mandala (literally “earth-disk”) both as the ecliptic plane
and as a planisphere. In the planisphere interpretation, the Tropic of
Capricorn corresponds to Manasottara mountain, and the Sweet
Water Ocean (Svadudaka) lies just beyond this ring-shaped mountain.
In Puranic tradition, the south is taken as the realm of Yamaraja,
the Lord of the dead, and the north consists of the path of the gods
(.deva-yana) and the region of Visnu. If we take the “inhabited world”
to represent the ecliptic (running through the zodiac), then Bhu
mandala as the ecliptic plane corresponds to the middle world. The
upper and lower worlds are then the regions to the celestial north and
celestial south of the ecliptic. In the interpretation of Jambudvlpa as a
region of south-central Asia, heaven is brought down to the earth and
cosmic elements such as the polar axis are identified with local earthly
features. This identification of earth with heaven is a general cultural
phenomenon.
In different traditions, the upper and lower worlds may be divided
into several levels (often seven or nine). In the center of the earth-disk
there is a world mountain or world pillar that links middle earth to the
lower and upper worlds. The world mountain represents the polar axis,
and the dwellings of great demigods are located on its summit.
The world mountain may be surrounded by other mountains that
define the cardinal directions, and these directions may be associated
with certain colors. Four sacred rivers may also flow from the world
mountain in the four cardinal directions.
There is a world tree that is often situated on the world mountain
(or four world trees may be located on the neighboring directional
mountains). The world tree extends from the earth to the heavens, and
it is nearly immortal. It is the source of rivers of nectar or pure water
that give health and longevity to those who drink them. The tree stands
in an earthly paradise where there are celestial gardens and rivers of
various substances, such as milk, oil, and honey. The tree or world
pillar is often associated with a great eaglelike bird that is the enemy
of great serpents dwelling in the lower world.
Although the Bhagavatam features four world trees in the cardinal
directions around Mount Sumeru, some Asian traditions place a
single tree on the summit of this mountain. For example, the CD



136 5. The Earth and Local Geography
Figure 5.5 The Scandi¬
navian tree of life

the cosmic mountain.
includes a picture of East Asian origin that is painted on a long vertical
strip, representing the vertical dimension of the universe. It shows the
seven dvipas and oceans of Sapta-dvipa, surmounted by Meru and a
single sacred tree.
This idea may be rooted in the Vedas. The Vedic scholar F. B. J.
Kuiper concluded that the Vedas support a conception of a single
world tree growing from the Vedic equivalent of Mount Meru: “The
tree rises up from the primordial hill and supports the roof of heaven
as the world-pillar. Its roots, however, reach through the mountain
into the primeval water, on which the earth rests, and thence they bring
upwards the amrta (the essence of these waters)” (Kuiper, 1983, p. 39).
This sounds very much like the Scandinavian Yggdrasil tree, illus¬
trated above. The primeval waters correspond to the Garbhodaka
Ocean, lying beneath Bhu-mandala.
Table 5.2 lists traditions with world mountains or world pillars. The
table is self-explanatory, but I will comment on a few of the items in it.

First of all, the two ideas of a world mountain and world pillar are
combined in Sumeru, which is referred to in the Puranas as a mountain
but is shaped like a pillar. Often the world pillar is said to be made of
a metal such as gold, copper, or iron (e.g. Hara Berezaiti means “iron
mountain” (Flolmberg, 1964, p. 358)). This concept is extremely
common in old traditions throughout Asia and Europe.
The idea of the world mountain as a source of rivers is illustrated
by Mount Sumeru, which is the source of the four branches of the
celestial Ganges. According to the Avesta, the spring on Mount Hara
Berezaiti is the source of all earthly waters (Evans-Wentz, 1981, p. 67).
The Navajos speak of four rivers flowing in the four directions from the
world center, but they place these rivers on a lower level than their
world mountain (Alexander, 1916, p. 159). Mount Khun-Lun of the



140 5. The Earth and Local Geography
Chinese was also the source of four rivers flowing in opposite
directions (Heinberg, 1989, p. 58), and the Siberian Kalmucks spoke
of a mountain lake from which four rivers flow to the points of the
compass (Holmberg, 1964, p. 359).
The theme of a mountain and four rivers is also illustrated by the
curious map of Gerardus Mercator mentioned in the last line of Table
5.2. In 1569 Mercator published a map of the arctic region showing a
circular continent in the middle of the Arctic Ocean (Campbell, 1981,
p. 22). In the center of this continent, at the north pole, Mercator
placed a mountain that is “said to be the highest in the world” (Hues,
1638, pp. 8,10). Four rivers or ocean channels extend at right angles
from this mountain to the coast of the circular continent. It looks as
though Mercator placed a small version of Jambudvlpa in the middle
of his arctic map. The question is: why?
The accepted explanation makes no reference to India. It is said
that Mercator based his polar map on the Inventio Fortunata, a lost
manuscript describing the supposed journey of an English monk to the
northern regions. Scholars have generally rejected the idea that this
journey took place as described, but some claim that the Inventio
Fortunata was “the principal vehicle by which the medieval Scandina¬
vian view of the North was incorporated into European geographical
ideas and cartography of the Renaissance” (Skelton etal, 1965, p. 179).
This is consistent with the traditional Scandinavian geography illus¬
trated in Figure 5.5, above, which is strongly reminiscent of Jambudvlpa.
The cosmologies of some Central Asian peoples show unmistak¬
able signs of Indian influence, and a number of scholars attribute this
to relatively recent Buddhist preaching. For example, the Mongols,
Buryats, and Kalmucks called their world mountains Sumber, Sumur,
and Sumer. The Zambu tree stood on Mount Sumer (Eliade, 1964,
p. 271) and can be compared with the Jambu tree of Jambudvlpa.
Mount Sumer was said to be 80,000 leagues high (Holmberg, 1964,
p. 346), and, for comparison, Mount Sumeru is 84,000 yojanas high.
Mircea Eliade, a well-known scholar of comparative religion,
offers the following account of the historical development of these
world mountain traditions:
The idea of a Cosmic Mountain as Center of the World is not neces¬
sarily of Oriental origin, for, as we have seen, the symbolism of the



5.2 Cross-cultural Themes in Cosmology 141
“Center” seems to have preceded the rise of the paleo-Oriental civiliza¬
tions. But the ancient traditions of the peoples of Central and North Asia
—who doubtless knew the image of a “Center of the World” and of the
Cosmic Axis—were modified by the continual influx of Oriental religious
ideas, whether Mesopotamian in origin (and disseminated through Iran)
or Indian (disseminated through Lamaism) (Eliade, 1964, p. 266).
It is plausible that recent influences from India (or Mesopotamia)
may overlay older core beliefs. However, world mountain traditions,
with details reminiscent of Indian cosmology, are also found among
people living outside the generally accepted sphere of Buddhist preach¬
ing. Mercator’s map is an example of this. Another instance is provided
by the Dogon tribe of Nigeria, whose cosmic pillar is the axis of rota¬
tion for fourteen worlds, including a disk-shaped earth (Corliss, 1991,
p. 1). Influences from India may well have been transmitted indepen¬
dently of Buddhism, and this may have been going on long before the
Buddhist period.
The Warao Indians of the Orinoco Delta in Venezuela also en¬
vision a cosmic axis extending above the center of their earth disk. But

they see this as being made of the tobacco smoke used by their shamans
to enter into trance and ascend into the heavens.
Joseph Needham, a prominent student of ancient China, connects
the Chinese Buddhist tradition of Mount Khun-Lun with “wheel
maps” showing a circular continent surrounded by an ocean. Figure 5.8
is a wheel map from eighteenth-century Korea showing a central
continent, surrounded by an ocean and another ring-shaped continent
(Needham, 1959, fig. 242). North is to the top, and we can see the Great
Wall of China crossing the Yellow river in the central continent.
Needham traces these wheel maps to India and, ultimately, to an
earlier origin in Babylon (Needham, 1959, p. 568). However, he also
wonders if their ultimate origin may have been from pre-Buddhist
India (Needham, 1959, p. 590).
Figure 5.9 shows a wheel map from Babylon. Wheel maps featur¬
ing a circular continent surrounded by ocean were also made in
medieval Europe. These were centered on Jerusalem, which was
regarded as the cosmic axis and world center in medieval Christianity.

The medieval Norse example in Figure 5.10 shows Vinland, which
may have represented lands in North America visited by the Vikings.
Some of the traditions of North America suggest links with India
that are difficult to reconcile with accepted ideas about transcontinen¬
tal travel—Buddhist or otherwise. Table 5.3 lists five traditions in
which certain colors (generally red, white, black, and yellow) are
associated with the four cardinal directions.

mountain (Evans
Wentz, 1981, p. 76).
Four of these traditions, the Puranas, the East Asian Buddhists,
the Kalmucks, and the Navajos, assign four colors to the four sides of
a world mountain, and these sides face in the four cardinal directions.
The Navajos also have four mountains, surrounding the central moun¬
tain and colored with the same colors. For the Mayans, I have not seen
any reference to a world mountain. However, the Mayan Book of
Chilam Balam of Chumayel refers to four cosmic Ceiba trees situated
in the four directions, east, south, west, and north, and having the four
colors red, yellow, black, and white, respectively (Leon-Portilla, 1980,
pp. 237-38).
Although the five traditions assign the colors to directions in dif¬
ferent permutations, they all use nearly the same colors. In the Vdyu
Purana, the colors of Sumeru are associated with the four varnas,
brahmana (white), vaisya (yellow), sudra (black), and ksatriya (red)
(Tagare, 1987,34.17-19). These are also the colors of the incarnations
of Krsna mentioned by Gargamuni (Bhdgavatam 10.8.13). The ques¬
tion is: How did these colors come to be connected with the four
directions in North American traditions?
The Navajos refer to their system of four directional mountains as
a four-petaled flower centered on their world mountain (Evans
Wentz, 1981, p. 78). Likewise, Jambudvlpa is described as a lotus with

carving showing the

personified form, with

Mount Sumeru in the center. The Navajos also describe four levels of
lower worlds from which their ancestors are said to have emerged, and
these can be compared with the seven lower worlds described in the
Puranas.
If we turn to the Near East, we find that the idea of the world
mountain appears in Semitic traditions and here too we find a number
of explicit parallels with Bhagavata cosmology. Some of the evidence
for this is summarized in Table 5.4.
In many traditions, the world mountain is identified symbolically
with some local mountain. This is illustrated by Mount Olympus of the
Greeks, Mount Alborz of the Iranians, and Mount Khun-Lun of the
Chinese. In Near Eastern tradition, the world mountain is the small hill
in Jerusalem known as Mount Zion (Clifford, 1972, p. 3). Thus the
circular continent centered on Jerusalem in medieval maps also pos¬
sessed a symbolic world mountain.
This may correspond to the Babylonian tradition of making circu¬
lar maps centered on Babylon, where the seven-tiered Ziggurat of
Marduk represented the world mountain linking earth with heaven
(Clifford, 1972, p. 21). We should note that the scholar Richard
Clifford states that the Weltberg or world mountain does not exist in
Mesopotamian tradition (Clifford, 1972, p. 2). But Eliade cites several
world-mountain names for Mesopotamian ziggurats (Eliade, 1964,
p. 267), and Clifford himself points out the cosmic meaning of the
seven-tiered Ziggurat of Marduk (Clifford, 1972, p. 21).
Jambudvipa can be interpreted as a map of a region of Asia ex¬
tending from India in the south to parts of Siberia in the north, and

extending from China in the east to the general area of Afghanistan
and Turkestan to the west (see Section 5.1, above). According to this
interpretation, Mount Meru corresponds to the Pamir mountains.
Thus Puranic tradition also assigns the world axis to a local mountain



148 5. The Earth and Local Geography
range which is far from the true north pole.
Richard Clifford has pointed out that Guri ’ili, the mountain of El,
“seems to be the paradisiac source of water that gives fertility”
(Clifford, 1972, p. 97). This is consistent with an ancient Phoenician
carving showing four streams emerging from a personified mountain
and an Assyrian seal showing celestial streams and a sacred mountain
(see Table 5.4). Of course, it is also consistent with the account in the
Bhagavatam of the four branches of the celestial Ganges flowing out
from Brahmapuri on top of Mount Sumeru. El is said to be the progen¬
itor of the gods (Clifford, 1972, p. 44) and the creator of the Earth
(Clifford, 1972, p. 45), and thus he is comparable to Brahma. A parallel
can also be seen between the cities of the eight Loka-palas surrounding
Brahmapuri and the assembly of the gods on Guri ’ili.
Table 5.4 lists three references in the Bible that refer to (1) a
mountain in the far north where the gods meet, (2) a mountain of God
that is the location of Eden, and (3) four rivers that flow out of Eden.
The first century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus identified one of
the four rivers flowing from Eden as the Ganges, the others being the
Nile, the Tigris, and the Euphrates (Heinberg, 1989, p. 164). This
suggests that the story connecting the Ganges with Mount Sumeru,
located on the polar axis, may have reached the Mediterranean area by
the time of Josephus.
However, there may also be a parallel between the four rivers of
Eden and four other rivers associated with Mount Sumeru. This is
suggested by information found in the apocryphal Book of the Secrets
ofEnoch. This book has come down to us only in Slavonic manuscripts
found recently in Russia and Serbia. However, scholars maintain that
its Greek original was highly influential in the early days of Christianity
(Lost Books, 1963, p. 81).
The book describes how the patriarch Enoch was taken by angels
on a tour of the seven heavens. In the third heaven Enoch saw the
fragrant and colorful tree of life that “covers all” and produces
wonderful fruits (Lost Books, 1963, p. 83). Next to the tree he saw
springs producing honey, milk, oil, and wine, which formed four rivers
flowing down into the paradise of Eden. This paradise was described
as a place prepared for pious people who had served the Lord and
performed acts of goodness (Lost Books, 1963, p. 84).



5.2 Cross-cultural Themes in Cosmology 149
This account can be compared with the story of the four trees in
Ilavrta-varsa that stand on great mountains and produce rivers of
nectar and honey, conferring health and youthful vitality on those who
drink from them. In particular, the Jambu tree is said to have branches
of pleasing colors and to be always bedecked with fruits and flowers
(Tagare, 1987, 35.27). It is said to rise to a height of thousands of
yojanas, and “it seems to cover all the heavens” (Taluqdar, 1916,
114.76).
The Jambu tree is typical of the trees of life found in traditions
from around the world. For comparison, consider the world tree of the
Yakut people of northeastern Siberia (Holmberg, 1964, p. 353). Like
the Jambu tree, it is said to be of immeasurable age, and its crown
pierces the heavens (Tagare, 1987, 46.24-26). Its cones are said to
be nine fathoms long, while the Jambu tree’s fruits are “the size of
elephants” (Bhagavatam 5.16.19). Its sap forms a “brawling stream,”
and when aged or weary animals drink from it, they regain their
“youth and overflowingness.” Near the tree, there is a lake of milk
(Holmberg, 1964, p. 352), a feature also shared by the Jambu tree. As
in many traditions, the Yakut tree of life is said to be located at the
navel of the earth (Holmberg, 1964, p. 351). For comparison, Mount
Sumeru is “born of the umbilical knot of Brahma” (Tagare, 1987,
34.16).
Although one might suppose that the Yakut story is simply a
product of local imagination, a study of the details of many traditions
suggests that this is not the case. The anthropologist Uno Holmberg
compared the Yakut story with Semitic, Egyptian, Scandinavian,
Iranian, Indian, and North Asian traditions. He concluded, “From the
fact that the ancient Babylonians already in olden times knew of the
paradise-mountain of the gods, the tree, and the water of life, we may
conclude that this belief, relics of which have come down to us from
ancient times, is of extreme age among the civilized peoples of Nearer
Asia” (Holmberg, 1964, p. 355).
In Central and North Asian cultures, the tree of life is typically
depicted both as a physically real tree connected with the structure of
the universe and as an allegorical tree representing the universe as the
reservoir of life (Eliade, 1964, p. 271). We see the same thing in Indian
tradition. Thus in Bhagavad-gita 15.1-4, the metaphor of an inverted

tree is used to show how the material universe is a reflection of the
spiritual world.
The tree of life also is found in the new world, along with other
features typical of Bhagavata cosmology. In addition to their four
directional trees (mentioned above), the Mayans also spoke of a
central green Ceiba tree called yaax-chel-cab, meaning “the first tree
of the world,” and also called “the tree of life” (Villa Rojas, 1988,
p. 139). The contemporary Yucatec Mayans describe seven celestial
planes, each with a central hole through which the cosmic Ceiba tree
extends its branches (Villa Rojas, 1988, p. 136).
The Lenni Lenape Indians, who lived along the Delaware river
before being displaced to Oklahoma, performed religious ceremonies
in a Big House with a central post made of an entire tree. This post

represents “the World Tree that ascended to heaven from soil
deposited on the back of a great turtle to form the earth” (Spirit,
1992, p. 164).
We may also note that the Lenni Lenape and other east-coast
Native Americans regarded the Big Dipper as a bear being chased by
hunters (Rail, 1998, p. 15). This, of course, matches this constellation’s
designation as Ursa Major, or the Great Bear. Curiously, the Seven
Sages (sapta-rsayah) which represent the Big Dipper in Sanskrit were
once called “bears” (rksah)—another hint of ancient international
communication (Eggeling, 1900, 2.1.2.4).
The anthropologist Peter Roe made a study of 105 South Ameri¬
can forest peoples, with focus on the Shipibos of the Peruvian Mon
taya (Roe, 1982, p. 26). He summed up the cosmology of these people
as follows: There is a disk-shaped earth surrounded by ocean. This disk
is sandwiched between upper and lower worlds which are often sub¬
divided into several levels. There is also a world tree with its roots in
the underworld and its crown in the heavens (Roe, 1982, pp. 127-38).



152 5. The Earth and Local Geography
The world tree is associated with a harpy eagle (a large South
American raptor) who is the enemy of enormous serpentine beings
connected with the underworld. To illustrate this, Roe recounts a story
in which the “eagles add their feathers to the arms of a human culture
hero and fly with him to steal medicine from the withholding and
threatening Poison Anaconda. After the successful theft the hero
conveniently . . . turns into a bird” (Roe, 1982, p. 258).
Naturally, the theme of cosmic tree, bird, and serpent is not limited
to South America. Mircea Eiiade made an observation about this
theme that is worth quoting in full: “The cosmological schema Tree
Bird (= Eagle), or Tree with a Bird at its top and a Snake at its roots,
although typical of the peoples of Central Asia and the ancient Ger¬
mans, is presumably of Oriental origin, but the same symbolism
is already formulated on prehistoric monuments” (Eiiade, 1964,
p. 273). This statement pushes the presumed Oriental origins back to
the time of the prehistoric monuments, or before.
In the Puranas, we see the tree-bird-serpent theme in Garuda, who
lives in a gigantic salmali tree (Bhdgavatam 5.20.8) and who is the
traditional enemy of the Nagas. The Nagas are intelligent serpentine
beings who live in the lower worlds called Mahatala and Patala (Bhd¬
gavatam 5.24.29-31). We can draw a parallel between the story of
the Shipibo hero and the Mahabharata story in which Garuda stole
the nectar of immortality in an effort to release his mother from the
clutches of the Nagas (van Buitenen, 1973, pp. 89-91).
Although most of the Nagas are described as poisonous and angry,
there is an exceptional Naga named Ananta Sesa who is an avatara of
Visnu. The Mahabharata says that He supports the earth by “encir¬
cling her entire with endless coils.” He also “carries Goddess Earth on
his head, encompassing all around the felly [wheel rim] of the ocean”
(van Buitenen, 1973, p. 93). Ananta Sesa lies on the Garbhodaka
Ocean below the lower worlds.
If we turn to the Norse Eddas, we learn of the Midgard serpent
(shown in Figure 5.5, p. 136) who “lies in the midst of the ocean encom¬
passing all the land and bites upon his own tail” (Sturluson, 1929, p. 42).
Unlike Ananta Sesa, the Midgard serpent is described as inimical.
Roe portrays the Shipibo’s earth disk as being surrounded by an
anaconda (Roe, 1982, p. 134). The Warao tribe of the Orinoco delta

have a similar cosmology in which the “Snake of Being” lies below the
surface of the encircling ocean, with its tail meeting its head (Krupp,
1983, p. 321). The Warao myths treat this snake as the source of all life.
The Dogon tribe of Nigeria, whose cosmic pillar was mentioned above,
also describe a serpent who lies in the ocean, encircles the earth disk,
and holds its tail in its mouth (Corliss, 1991, p. 1).
The Mongols tell of the evil snake named Losy who lived in the
ocean under the earth. By squirting poison on the earth, this serpent
tried to crush out all life. The hero Otshirvani tried to kill it and failed.
He then ascended the Sumer mountain, transformed himself into the
Garide bird, wrapped the snake three times around the mountain, and
smashed its head (Holmberg, 1964, p. 345).
Uno Holmberg states that Otshirvani is the Buddhist Bodhisattva
Vairapani, but he regards this as only a recent addition to an ancient
story (Holmberg, 1964, p. 346). Clearly the Garide bird (Garuda) and
the Sumer mountain (Sumeru) derive from India. But what can we say



154 5. The Earth and Local Geography
about the world-girdling serpents, the multilevel universes, and the
world trees and mountains that appear over and over again in widely
separated traditions?
There are three basic hypothesis to explain this widespread ap¬
pearance of similar cosmological themes:
\,
1. Independent invention influenced by environmental and psycho¬
logical factors common to all humans.
2. Cultural diffusion due to migration, trade and colonization, or the
activity of traveling religious preachers.
3. Direct experience of higher realms of being by humans living in
different parts of the world.
Although independent invention undoubtedly explains some fea¬
tures of the world’s cosmological systems, the many shared details
appearing in these systems make it seem doubtful that this could
provide a complete explanation. Eliade and Holmberg both tend to
prefer cultural diffusion. However, this hypothesis involves a number
of controversial topics, such as the debate regarding pre-Columbian
transoceanic contact between the Old and New Worlds.
It is clear that the observed parallels to Bhagavata cosmology in
various traditions cannot be attributed to recent direct borrowing from
the Bhagavatam and related Sanskrit texts. The differences between
the traditions and the texts are too great for this to be plausible.
However, it is possible that the Bhagavata cosmology was spread
around the world thousands of years ago and that modifications have
separately accumulated in various parts of the world since that time.
The hypothesis of cultural diffusion requires some original cul¬
tural center which was the source of the diffusing elements. The
Mahabharata and Puranas such as the Bhagavatam describe an ancient
and highly influential civilization centered in greater India. It is pos¬
sible that this civilization may have been an important center of cul¬
tural influence, if not the original center. Other ancient centers of
civilization may have also played an important role, and the level of
international communication in ancient times may have been greater
than we commonly suppose.
The third hypothesis introduces another factor that should be
taken into account in such investigations. In nearly all of the cultures



5.2 Cross-cultural Themes in Cosmology 155
mentioned in this survey, it was once believed that humans can gain
direct access to the “mythological” regions and beings described in
their cosmological systems. The modern enlightened thinker will tend
to reject this. But our present knowledge is far from perfect or
complete, and it may be that there is some truth to the old beliefs of
nearly all human societies. The possibility of direct access to higher
realms should therefore also be considered in efforts to understand
our origins and fundamental nature.

The Realm of the Demigods
6.1 THE EARTHLY HEAVEN
In earlier chapters, we have shown that Jambudvipa can be inter¬
preted either as the northern hemisphere (roughly) or as a region in
Asia including India and adjacent lands. In the former interpretation,
Jambudvipa is part of a planisphere map, with Mount Meru as the
polar axis (see Chapter 3). In the latter, Mount Meru corresponds to
the Pamir mountain range north of India (see Section 5.1). In the
orbital map discussed in Chapter 4, Jambudvipa simply serves as the
center and thus it represents the earth in this geocentric system.
Yet Mount Meru is described in the Bhagavatam as an inverted
cone 84,000 yojanas high and 32,000 yojanas across at the top. The
summit of Mount Meru is said to be occupied by the golden city of Lord
Brahma, which is surrounded by the cities of the eight Loka-palas or
Guardians of the Worlds. This is not something we would expect to
find anywhere on the earth.
Our thesis is that this description pertains to another important
interpretation of Jambudvipa that was intended in the original text of
the Bhagavatam. Jambudvipa was regarded as a heavenly region, and
this must be distinguished from Jambudvipa as a region of this earth.
We get a hint of this in our cross-cultural study (Section 5.2), in which
we repeatedly see things belonging to heaven associated with localized
earthly regions.
6.1.1 Jambudvipa as the Earthly Heaven
According to the Bhagavatam, Jambudvipa is divided into nine
varsas, or continents. Of these, only one—called Bharata-varsa—is
157



158 6. The Realm of the Demigods
inhabited by ordinary human beings. The other eight varsas constitute
a heavenly region. This is described in verse 5.17.11:
Among the nine varsas, the tract of land known as Bharata-varsa is
understood to be the field of fruitive activities. Learned scholars and
*
saintly persons declare the other eight varsas to be meant for very highly
elevated pious persons. After returning from the heavenly worlds, they
enjoy the remaining results of their pious activities in these eight earthly
varsas.
In the Sanskrit text, the other eight varsas are called Ubhaumani
svarga-padani,” or the heavenly places on earth. In 5.17.12 it is said that
the inhabitants of these eight varsas live for 10,000 years and are almost
like demigods. They have the strength of 10,000 elephants, and their
bodies are like thunderbolts. They engage in sexual union until one
year of life remains, at which point the wife conceives a child. (This
system is standard for demigods, and the child attains adulthood
without a prolonged period of growth.)
In Ilavrta-varsa, the centermost of these eight regions, the in¬
habitants are consistently described as heavenly beings. In verses
5.16.13-14, four lakes surrounding Mount Sumeru in Ilavrta-varsa
are mentioned and it is said that,
The celestial beings [such as the Siddhas, Caranas and Gandharvas]
who are also known as upadevas, enjoy the facilities of those four lakes.
Consequently they have the natural perfections of mystic yoga [such as
the power to become smaller than the smallest or greater than the
greatest].
Four celestial gardens are near these lakes, and according to verse
5.16.15,
The best of the demigods, along with their wives, who are like orna¬
ments of heavenly beauty, meet together and enjoy within those gardens,
while their glories are sung by lesser demigods known as Gandharvas.
In the same region, a river of mango juice called Arunoda is
described. It is said in 5.16.18 that the wives of the Yaksas act as
maidservants to Bhavanl, the wife of Lord Siva, and they become



6.1 The Earthly Heaven 159
fragrant by drinking the water of this river. According to 5.17.15, no
male person other than Lord Siva is allowed in one part of Ilavrta
varsa, and any man who enters this region is turned into a woman
by Bhavani (the goddess Durga).
Another river is produced from the broken fruits of the Jambu
(Rose Apple) tree, after which Jambudvlpa is named. This river
generates a kind of gold which is said in verses 5.16.20-21 to be enjoyed
by the great demigods and their youthful wives.
Verse 5.16.25 sums up the situation in Ilavrta-varsa:
The residents of the material world who enjoy the products of these
flowing rivers have no wrinkles on their bodies and no grey hair. They
never feel fatigue, and perspiration does not give their bodies a bad odor.
They are not afflicted by old age, disease or untimely death, they do not
suffer from chilly cold or scorching heat, nor do their bodies lose their
luster. They all live very happily, without anxieties until death.
The sharp distinction between these eight varsas and Bharata
varsa is shown by verse 5.19.19, which says that in Bharata-varsa,
The people who take birth in this tract of land are divided according
to the qualities of material nature—the modes of goodness, passion, and
ignorance. Some of them are born as exalted personalities, some are
ordinary human beings, and some are extremely abominable, for in
Bharata-varsa one takes birth exactly according to one’s past karma.
This and similar verses are the only references to ordinary human
beings (manusya) in the entire discussion of Bhu-mandala in the
Bhagavatam. In particular, verse 5.19.21 states that human beings
living in Bharata-varsa are extremely fortunate because of the unique
spiritual opportunities which exist there. These opportunities are not
available in the heavenly regions, and therefore the demigods are said
to aspire to take birth in Bharata-varsa.
Thus, according to the Bhagavatam, the eight varsas or continents
of Jambudvipa outside Bharata-varsa constitute a heavenly region,
with inhabitants that live for 10,000 years, free of all bodily inebrieties.
In contrast, Bharata-varsa is the place of karma, where people suffer
the vicissitudes of ordinary human life but also have the advantage of
being able to quickly attain spiritual liberation. At the same time,



160 6. The Realm of the Demigods
Bharata-varsa also has a parallel, heavenly aspect, and thus Jambudvipa
can be seen fully as a heavenly region (see Section 6.1.2).
At first glance, the account of heavenly life in Jambudvipa conveys
the impression that Puranic geographers regarded countries outside of
India as idyllic earthly paradises. Thus Joseph Schwartzberg says that
\%
A remarkable aspect of many Indian cosmographies is that they do
not perceive distant realms as less glorious than their own revered home
region. ... In this they differ from the cosmographies of most other
cultures (Schwartzberg, 1987, p. 336).
However, the Bhagavatam verse 2.4.18 refers to races “addicted to
sinful acts,” including Hunas, Pulindas, Yavanas, and Khasas. These
have been identified respectively as Huns, Greeks, Turks, and Mongo¬
lians—all peoples living outside of India in distinctly unheavenly

conditions. It would seem that Indian cosmography may, in fact, agree
with other cultures in assigning degraded or barbaric peoples to
outlying regions. But this implies that these neighboring regions must
be included in Bharata-varsa itself. Indeed, it follows from this line of
reasoning that all lands of the earth populated with suffering, short¬
lived people must be part of Bharata-varsa.
This idea has been widely accepted in India. For example, here are
two Indian examples of nineteenth-century cosmological diagrams
portraying the entire earth globe as part of Bharata-varsa:

is shown orbiting the earth and moon, which are shown next to Mount Meru. Mer¬
cury and Venus are shown closely orbiting the sun, and Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn
are orbiting further out. This is shown for two positions of the sun simultaneously.



162 6. The Realm of the Demigods
1. A South Indian Cosmological Diagram
The nineteenth-century South Indian sannydsi, Sri Tiruvenkata
Ramanuja Jiyar Swami, produced a diagram (partly shown in Figures
6.1-3), showing the relation between Puranic cosmology and the solar
system of modern astronomy. The original diagram is in the Academy
of Sanskrit Research, Melkote, India. It was apparently reworked in
this century, and labels in English were added to the original labels in
Tamil. The CD includes the diagram, along with several blow-ups
showing parts of it in greater detail.
One of these blow-ups, reproduced here in Figure 6.2, shows the
earth globe superimposed over Bharata-varsa in Tiruvehkata’s ren¬
dering of Jambudvlpa. In this way, he identifies the entire earth globe
as Bharata-varsa.
It is noteworthy that Tiruvenkata Swami’s solar system model is
the same as that of the famous Danish astronomer, Tycho Brahe. (See

relative motions of the planets, while leaving the earth at the center.
This is the natural interpretation of Bhu-mandala in relation with the
solar system, and we have argued that it is built into the dimensions of
Bhu-mandala, as given in the Bhagavatam. (See Section 4.4.)

book in Bengali presenting his cosmological views. Here we see a map
of the world superimposed on a diagram of Bharata-varsa. Note the
Himalayan mountain range which extends across the upper border of
the world map. This represents the Himalayas mentioned in the
Bhagavatam as the northern boundary of Bharata-varsa, and it gives

rise to the problem that now there are two sets of Himalayan
mountains to account for.
Figure 6.5 is another diagram from South India, dating to the
1970s, which tries to attach the earth globe to a mountain extending up
from Bharata-varsa on a literal Bhu-mandala disk. The fine details in

this diagram can be seen in color in the CD.
The literal approach clearly runs into irreconcilable contradic¬
tions. However, this problem can be avoided by viewing Jambudvlpa
as a map of a heavenly region. We must distinguish this from Jambu¬
dvlpa as a planisphere map or Jambudvlpa as a local map of Asia. Our
thesis is that the heavenly Jambudvlpa belongs to another interpreta¬
tion intended by the author of the Bhdgavatam.
If this is correct, then it is natural to ask what this heavenly realm
is supposed to be made of, where it is, and how it relates to the earthly
regions represented by other interpretations of the Jambudvlpa map.
Here the large dimensions of the features of Jambudvlpa may provide
a clue.
Jambudvlpa is said to be 100,000 yojanas across (about the size of
the sun). It contains mountains, including the Himalayas, which are
10,000 yojanas high. There are trees 1,100 yojanas tall, such as the
Jambu (Rose-Apple) tree, after which Jambudvlpa is named. The
inhabitants are also very large, as we show below in Section 6.1.3. It
would seem that everything is on a grand scale in the heavenly realm.
The simple message is that we are literally like ants in relation to the
demigods and upadevas.
We suggest that the originators of the Puranic accounts were not
simply deluded into thinking that the earth is nearly a hundred times
bigger than it actually is. Nor did they think that earthly mountains
such as the Himalayas are many thousands of times taller than they
actually are. Rather, they intended to convey the idea of a parallel,
heavenly earth which is built on the scale of the demigods and is distinct
from this small earth globe.
This parallel earth is not accessible to our ordinary senses, and thus
we can say in modern language that it is higher-dimensional. Great
yogis and sages were said to visit this realm, using mystic powers, or
siddhis. The connection between the heavenly realm and its earthly
counterpart is this: Important sites in the earthly world were regarded
as gateways through which empowered persons could easily gain



6.1 The Earthly Heaven 165
access to the higher regions. In particular, the earthly Himalayas were
seen as portals to higher realms.
The Puranas and related literatures from India make many refer¬
ences to parallel realities that can be accessed by mystic powers. A
prime example is Vrndavana, where Krsna’s pastimes are said to take
place eternally, even though Vrndavana looks to ordinary vision like
a mundane Indian town. Krsna’s pastimes are believed to take place in
a parallel Vrndavana, which is invisible to ordinary people, but which
can be accessed by those who have achieved special spiritual vision.
Significantly, this parallel Vrndavana is also unlimitedly expansive,
even though the Vrndavana of this world extends over a few miles. This
topic is explored in detail in Section 6.2.
In its simplest form, the relationship between this earth and the
heavenly Jambudvipa is that an empowered yogi or sage can enter the
heavenly continuum, starting from a location on this earth. This is done
by using the siddhis described in the Eleventh Canto of the Bhagavatam
(see 11.15.3-9). In many Puranic stories, it superficially appears that
such a person simply travels by ordinary means to places on this earth
that seem fabulous and impossible. In fact, however, a parallel realm
is intended which extends on a cosmic scale and can be reached only
by yogic methods of travel.
6.1.2 The Status of Bharata-varsa
If the eight varsas of Jambudvipa, other than Bharata-varsa, were
regarded as heavenly, then what is the status of Bharata-varsa itself?
The answer is that Bharata-varsa was apparently regarded in Puranic
tradition both as an earthly domain and as a higher, heavenly world.
We have seen that ordinary human beings are assigned to Bharata
varsa. But the Bhagavatam also contains stories in which demigods are
portrayed as living there. For example, in the story of Kapila Muni and
Devahuti, it is said that Svayambhuva Manu ruled the earth with its
seven oceans from Brahmavarta, which is located in India (see 3.21.26).
Likewise the sacrifice in which Prajapati Daksa offended Lord Siva in
the presence of many demigods took place at the confluence of the
Ganges and the Yamuna (4.2.35).
This tells us that demigods not only visited India in the distant past
but were actually based there. In the Bhagavatam, their activities are



166 6. The Realm of the Demigods
described from the point of view of the demigods themselves, and thus
they are presented as normal, day-to-day affairs. However, the ques¬
tion can be raised as to whether or not ordinary people would have
been able to witness these affairs or participate in them.
Of course, one may argue that stories of demigods in India are
merely exaggerated versions of stories of ordinary human beings. Be
this as it may, our concern here is with how Bharata-varsa was
understood in the Bhagavatam. Our overriding impression is that it
was (and still is) seen as a composite of parallel realms which can be
accessed at different levels of sensory functioning.
If we turn to the Caitanya-caritamrta, which dates back about 500
years, we find evidence indicating that activities involving demigods
were thought to take place in India in recent times. For example, the
Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya-lila 9.175-7) says that Lord Caitanya
r rr
met Lord Siva and his wife Durga on the hill of Sri Saila in South India,
where they were living dressed as brahmanas. The implication is that
more was happening on Sri Saila hill than can be seen by ordinary
vision.
India is full of such stories, even today. For example, the Bhaga
vatam states that Maru and Devapi, two ancient royal princes belong¬
ing to the Surya and Soma dynasties, are still living in the Himalayas
in a place called Kalapa-grama. By the power of mystic yoga they will
prolong their lives until the beginning of the next Satya-yuga and then
revive the lost Surya and Soma dynasties by begetting children (see
verses 9.12.6 and 9.22.17-18). If we go to the Himalayas, we will
certainly not be able to perceive Maru and Devapi using our ordinary
senses. However, there are stories of yogis who were able to visit them
through mystic powers, and it is significant that the meetings were said
to take place in a parallel reality where Maru and Devapi are residing.
6.1.3 Size of the Inhabitants of Jambudvipa
In verses 4.6.32-33, the Bhagavatam gives the following descrip¬
tion of Lord Siva sitting beneath a banyan tree in Kailasa, which is part
of Jambudvipa,
That banyan tree was 100 yojanas high, and its branches spread over
75 yojanas around. The tree cast a fine shade which permanently cooled



6.1 The Earthly Heaven 167
the temperature, yet there was no noise of birds.
The demigods saw Lord Siva sitting under that tree, which was
competent to give perfection to mystic yogis and deliver all people. As
grave as time eternal, he appeared to have given up all anger.
We have 8 miles per yojana and a tree 100 yojanas tall and 150
yojanas in diameter. Our question is: If the tree was this big, how big
was Lord Siva? Consider a person 6 feet tall sitting under a tall tree
about 100 feet high. His height is 6% of the height of the tree. Using the
same proportion, Lord Siva must be 6 yojanas tall (48 miles). Of
course, we don’t know the proportions in this case. But it stands to
reason that in a landscape with gigantic trees, the people or demigods
must be correspondingly large.
According to the Bhagavatam verse 5.16.12, there are four trees
1,100 yojanas tall standing on four mountains surrounding Mount
Meru in the cardinal directions. The mountains themselves are 10,000
yojanas tall. These trees are listed in Table 6.1 (p. 168).
At roughly eight miles per yojana, 1,100 yojanas is greater than the
diameter of the earth. We suggest that the inhabitants living near these

The story of Matsya-avatara, Lord Visnu’s fish incarnation, illus¬
trates large sizes for beings entering into the dvipas and oceans of Bhu
mandala, outside of Jambudvipa. According to this story, King Satya
vrata of Dravidadesa (in South India) was once offering water in a
religious ceremony on the bank of the river Krtamala, when a small
fish appeared in his palms. The fish asked for protection from aquatic
predators, and the king kept him in a jug. Quickly, however, the fish
grew, and the king had to place him in larger and larger bodies of
water.
After the king transferred the now-gigantic fish to the ocean, the
fish revealed himself as an incarnation of the Supreme Lord and
warned the king that in seven days the three worlds Bhuh, Bhuvah, and
Svah would merge in the waters of destruction. The Lord informed the
king that He would send a boat, and He said, “Thereafter, O King, you
shall collect all types of herbs and seeds and load them on that great
boat. Then, accompanied by the seven rsis [sages] and surrounded by
all kinds of living entities, you shall get aboard that boat, and without
moroseness you shall easily travel with your companions on the ocean
of inundation, the only illumination being the effulgence of the great
rsis" (Bhagavatam 8.24.34-35).
In due course, this happened, and the king witnessed the great fish
swimming in the ocean. Verse 8.24.44 states,
Then, while the King constantly meditated upon the Supreme Per¬
sonality of Godhead, a large golden fish appeared in the ocean of
inundation. The fish had one horn and was one million yojanas long.



6.1 The Earthly Heaven 169
In 8.24.45, it is stated that the king anchored the boat to the fish’s
horn. For this to be possible, the king must have had a size suitable for
dealing with the eight-million-mile fish.
One response to this story is to dismiss it as a ridiculous exaggera¬
tion. However, the story is meaningful from the viewpoint of Puranic
cosmology. In one important interpretation, the “earth” that was
inundated corresponds to the plane of the ecliptic, and its illuminated
region extends hundreds of millions of miles to the orbit of Saturn
(see Section 4.4). This would provide swimming room for the divine
fish. The Seven Sages are also celestial. They are said to rule the seven
stars of the Big Dipper (Ursa Major).
This particular flood marked the transition from the Caksusa
manvantara period to the Vaivasvata manvantara, and King Satyavrata
became Vaivasvata Manu, the progenitor of mankind in the new age.
Although this is extraordinary from a modern standpoint, a basic
premise of the Bhagavatam is that human beings can become elevated
to divine or transcendental status.
It is interesting to compare this account with the Biblical story
of Noah. That story deals with a purely terrestrial flood. However,
scholars trace the Biblical story back to the Sumerian legend of Utna
pishtim, who was also saved from a deluge on a boat. It is interesting
to note that Utnapishtim was later elevated to the status of a demigod,
and thus the story may have celestial connections (Sanders, 1972,
p. 125).
There may also be a parallel between the story of Satyavrata and
that of the “Seven Sages” (Apkallu) of Babylonian tradition, who were
said to have “lived before the Flood” and to have built the walls of the
sacred city of Uruk. The same can be said of the Egyptian “Building
Texts” of the second century b.c., which associate Seven Sages with
Flood imagery describing the emergence of the “Great Primeval
Mound” from the primeval waters (Hancock, 1996, p. 201).
The story of King Satyavrata began along the banks of the river
Krtamala in South India (see Section 5.1.2), and the king was presum¬
ably of human size at first. Later on, however, we find him coursing
through a cosmic ocean and his size must be on the order of thousands
of miles. This clearly requires some mode of expansion similar to that
of Matsya-avatara Himself. In fact, this is provided by the mahitna
siddhi, the power of unlimited expansion (see 11.15.11).



170 6. The Realm of the Demigods
In addition to mahimd-siddhi, there is anima-siddhi, the power
of becoming smaller than the smallest (see 11.15.10). According to
the Bhdgavatam, these mystic powers are inherent in God, and by the
grace of God, they can be conferred on lesser beings to varying degrees.
It is in relation to this background that we should see the vast
>
distances that the Bhdgavatam assigns to Jambudvlpa. We suggest that
demigods were thought to exist naturally on a superhuman scale of size
and to use anima-siddhi to reduce their size when appearing before
ordinary human beings. They then used mahimd-siddhi to return to
their normal size (or larger).
According to the Bhdgavatam, God simultaneously spans all
scales of size from largest to smallest. God also defines space rather
than existing within it as an object among other objects. The space thus
defined involves unlimited scales and dimensions, and it is not limited
to the three-dimensional Euclidian continuum. However, it does in¬
clude this continuum. Indeed, it contains many three-dimensional
continua.
This system of thought rules out the kind of comprehensive, model
of reality that we are familiar with in the West. Rather, it lends itself to
multiple models that represent different aspects of an inconceivable
total reality.
Another example illustrating the large size of demigods is the
Bhdgavatam's story of the churning of the Milk Ocean. Briefly, the
story goes as follows: The Devas and the Asuras held a truce in their
celestial battles, and with the encouragement of Lord Visnu, they
attempted to churn the Ocean of Milk in Bhu-mandala and thereby
produce divine nectar. They used the Mandara Mountain as a churn¬
ing rod and the serpent Vasuki as the rope for rotating the mountain.
Unfortunately, the mountain sank and became stuck. Lord Visnu
responded by appearing as Kurma-avatara, the Tortoise incarnation.
Verses 8.7.8-9 state,
Seeing the situation that had been created by the will of the Supreme,
the unlimitedly powerful Lord, whose determination is infallible, took
the wonderful shape of a tortoise, entered the water, and lifted the great
Mandara Mountain.
When the demigods and demons saw that Mandara Mountain had
been lifted, they were enlivened and encouraged to begin churning again.



6.2 Parallel Worlds and Yogic Travel 171
The mountain rested on the back of the great tortoise, which extended
for one hundred thousand yojanas like a large island.
If Kurma was 100,000 yojanas across, then presumably the other
participants in the churning of the Milk Ocean were on a scale of
hundreds or thousands of yojanas in size.
6.2 PARALLEL WORLDS AND YOGIC TRAVEL
The Puranas make frequent reference to modes of travel which are
impossible from the standpoint of our familiar physical conceptions.
Here we will survey some accounts of such mystical travel in an effort
to understand how physical reality is portrayed in the Puranic tradi¬
tion. These accounts are drawn from the Bhagavatam, the Maha
bharata, and recent Indian hagiography.
There is a process of travel, called vihayasa, in which a physical
object is moved directly through the ether to another location, without
interacting with intervening gross matter. Here the word “ether” is
used to translate the Sanskrit word “akasa.” Akasa is space, but it is
considered to be a substance or plenum, rather than a void.
The story of the abduction of Aniruddha in the Bhagavatam
(10.62.16-21) contains an example of vihayasa travel. A young prin¬
cess named Usa was living in the closely guarded inner quarters of her
Figure 6.7

172 6. The Realm of the Demigods
father’s palace in the city of Sonitapura. One day, Usa had a vivid
dream about a beautiful young man who became her lover. She was
certain that the person in her dream really existed, and she engaged her
friend, the mystic yogini Citralekha, to find him for her:
Citralekha said, “I will remove your distress. If He is to be found
anywhere in the three worlds, I will bring this future husband of yours
who has stolen your heart. Please show me who He is.”
Saying this, Citralekha proceeded to draw accurate pictures of vari¬
ous demigods, Gandharvas, Siddhas, Caranas, Pannagas, Daityas, Vidya
dharas, Yaksas and humans.
O King, among the humans, Citralekha drew pictures of the Vrsnis,
including Surasena, Anakadundubhi, Balarama and Krsna. When Usa
saw the picture of Pradyumna she became bashful, and when she saw
Aniruddha’s picture she bent her head down in embarrassment. Smiling,
she exclaimed, “He’s the one! It’s Him!”
Citralekha, endowed with mystic powers, recognized Him [Anirud
dha] as Krsna’s grandson. My dear King, she then traveled by the mystic
skyway [vihayasa] to Dvaraka, the city under Lord Krsna’s protection.
There she found Pradyumna’s son Aniruddha sleeping upon a fine
bed. With her yogic power she took Him away to Sonitapura, where she
presented her girlfriend Usa with her beloved.
This kind of mystic travel is commonplace in the Bhagavatam. It
implies that physical entities (e.g. the bodies of Citralekha and Ani¬
ruddha) can be decoupled from other matter and travel directly
through the underlying ether.
The Bhagavatam (3.26.34-49) presents an account of the sahkhya
philosophy, in which the elements of gross matter (air, fire, water, and
earth) are described as successive transformations of the ether. The
sequence of transformation is as follows:
sound, ether, touch, air, form,
fire, taste, water, odor, earth
Each element is regarded as the previous element plus an addi¬
tional property contributed by a subtle sense element (tanmatra).
Since the elements are derived from modes of sense perception, they
appear to be, in a sense, insubstantial and to be ultimately based on
consciousness. Thus from this Puranic perspective, the idea of



6.2 Parallel Worlds and Yogic Travel 173
decoupling an object from other matter and moving it through the
ether is much more plausible than it is from the standpoint of modern
thinking.
In the Bhagavatam verse 11.15.21, a form of mystic travel is
described which is based on the mind. Krsna says that
The yogi who completely absorbs his mind in Me, and who then
makes use of the wind that follows the mind to absorb the material body
in Me, obtains through the potency of meditation on Me the mystic per¬
fection by which his body immediately follows his mind wherever it goes.
This makes sense from the perspective of the sankhya philosophy,
in which the body is a transformation of subtle sense objects connected
with the mind. In this transformation air (wind) is the second gross
element, after ether.
If matter and space (ether) are transformations of modes of sense
perception, then it would appear that they are not limited to the three
dimensional framework of Euclidian geometry and Cartesian coordi¬
nates. Indeed, this is strongly implied by the siddhi called prdpti, which
is said to allow objects to be moved from one point to another without
crossing the intervening space.
Srlla A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada recounted a per¬
sonal story illustrating this siddhi:
In my childhood I had got one tutor. So he was telling about his
spiritual master. He was a yogi. .. . He said that when he visited his
spiritual master, who was a yogi, his spiritual master asked him,“What do
you want to eat?” And because my teacher knew that his spiritual master
was a great yogi, he wanted to have a taste of pomegranate of Kabul.
In India pomegranate of Kabul, Afghanistan, that is very famous. So
his spiritual master said, “Yes, you will find it in this room. You can see
it.” So he saw that it has been taken from the tree of pomegranate, and
the juice was falling down. You see? So these wonders can be played by
a yogi.
The idea can be illustrated by considering travel on a two- dimen¬
sional surface. If we are allowed to create short tubes linking distant
points on the surface, then we can move from one point to another (e.g.
Kabul to Calcutta) without crossing the intervening space along the



174 6. The Realm of the Demigods
surface. But to create such tubes we must go outside the framework
of two-dimensional Euclidian space, perhaps by bending the surface
in three-dimensional space. Likewise, to jump between points in
three-dimensional space, we would have to go outside the Euclidian,
three-dimensional framework.
This way of understanding prapti siddhi is based on an extension
of the familiar system of Euclidian geometry, which forms the basis of
modern conceptions of space. The Bhagavatam, however, explains
prapti siddhi, or “the power of mystic acquisition,” in terms of sense
perception rather than geometry. Thus in verse 11.15.13, Krsna says that
Fixing his mind completely in Me within the element of false ego
generated from the mode of goodness, the yogi obtains the power of
mystic acquisition, by which he becomes the proprietor of the senses of
all living entities. He obtains such perfection because his mind is ab¬
sorbed in Me.
This suggests an entirely novel approach to space: Consciousness
is taken as the basis of reality, and space is understood as a coordinated
system of sense perceptions. By systematically changing the sense
perceptions, one can move or transform things in space, or even enter
into different realms of experience.
In many Puranic stories, a person leaves this world and enters into
a parallel reality—a material domain that is decoupled from this world,
but is still accessible by mystical modes of travel. An example is the
story of Arjuna and Ulupi (see Appendix 13), where the hero Arjuna
is pulled down into the Ganges by a Naga woman named Ulupi.
Instead of hitting the bottom of the river, Arjuna finds himself in the
kingdom of the Nagas. This kingdom is accessible from this world, but
it is not directly in this three-dimensional continuum.
In some stories, it appears at first glance that mystical travel
proceeds in three-dimensions, just like ordinary travel. But on closer
inspection, one can see that a shift to another continuum has taken
place. An example is Madhvacarya’s visit to Vyasadeva (Appendix
14), in which the thirteenth-century religious reformer Madhvacarya
is said to have flown like Hanuman from Badarikasrama in the Hima¬
layas to Uttara-badarikasrama, the residence of the sage Vedavyasa.
Although it may appear that Madhvacarya simply jumped over some



6.3 The Vertical Dimension 175
mountains (a considerable feat in itself), closer examination of the
story shows that Uttara-badarikasrama is not of this world.
Finally, there are stories that explicitly posit a parallel reality. An
example is the story of Duhkhi Krsna Dasa (Appendix 15), which took
place in Vrndavana, near modern New Delhi. In this story, the
sixteenth-century saint Duhkhi Krsna Dasa (later Syamananda Pandit)
met a gopi from Krsna's transcendental Vrndavana, and later entered
this transcendental realm in meditation.
6.3 THE VERTICAL DIMENSION
The plane of Bhu-mandala nearly bisects the sphere of the Brah¬
manda, and the axis perpendicular to this plane can be called the
vertical dimension of the Brahmanda. The positions along this axis
assigned to the sun, moon, naksatras, and five traditional planets are
discussed in previous sections (3.4,4.3, and 4.7). Additional features of
the Brahmanda are distributed along the vertical axis, and these are
part of a map of the heavenly regions of the demigods.
Some of these additional features are assigned heights above Bhu
mandala. These are listed in the table on the next page, which expands
on Table 3.5 in Chapter 3 (p. 68).
The Visnu Purdna concludes its description of the planets and stars
up to the polestar, Dhruvaloka, by saying, “Such, Maitreya, is the
elevation of the three spheres (Bhur, Bhuvar, Svar) which form the
region of the consequences of works.” This indicates that Svargaloka,
which includes the kingdom of Indra, begins at the level of Dhruvaloka.
Bhuvarloka is the region between Bhu-mandala and Dhruvaloka.
Maharloka (also called Rsi-loka), Janaloka, and Tapoloka are
described in the Bhdgavatam as higher systems reserved for great
sages. Satyaloka is the abode of Lord Brahma, the creator of the
worlds. The heights of these systems above Bhu-mandala are not given
in the Bhdgavatam, but they are listed in the Visnu Purdna (Wilson,
1980, p. 308). The commentator Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura com¬
bined the heights for Maharloka through Satyaloka in the Visnu
Purdna with the planetary heights given in the Bhdgavatam. This is not
entirely consistent, since the Visnu Purdna gives somewhat smaller
planetary heights than the Bhdgavatam. Nonetheless, we have repro¬
duced his figures in the table.

If we understand Bhu-mandala as representing a plane closely
parallel to the ecliptic, then the planets and systems “above” Bhu
mandala are on the northern side of this plane (in the sense of celestial
north). Likewise, systems “below” Bhu-mandala are on the southern
side of this plane.
Height relative to Bhu-mandala is used to signify degree of divine
quality. Thus the highest system is the most “elevated” in the spiritual
sense. Likewise, there are lower systems beneath Bhu-mandala whose
inhabitants are said to be highly materialistic or unspiritual (see Figure
6.9). But divinity again appears when we descend below the lowest of
these systems and reach Garbhodakasayl Visnu and Ananta Sesa.



6.3 The Vertical Dimension 111

The heights of the different systems above and below Bhu
mandala may not be intended as literal distances. We have observed
that the heights of the planets above Bhu-mandala figure in two
interpretations—the planisphere model and the ecliptic plane model.
In the former, the heights of the planets define different planes of
projection in an astrolabelike model, and they do not refer to physical
distances. Similarly, the heights of the higher lokas might refer to
different levels of spiritual status, rather than to different distances in
ordinary space.
The Bhdgavatam says relatively little about the higher systems,
starting with Maharloka. However, life in these systems is described in
detail in the sixteenth-century work Sri Brihat Bhagavatamritam by
Sanatana Goswami (1975). There it is indicated that each of these
systems is invisible and nearly inaccessible to the inhabitants of the
systems below it. Satyaloka, the topmost system, is described as d-vdk
manasam or “beyond the description of mind and words” in verse
5.1.21 of the Bhdgavatam, and thus it is clearly not an object in our
three-dimensional continuum.
In addition to the higher worlds, our height table has a number of
entries beneath the sun. The first of these is the planet Rahu, which is
10,000 yojanas below the sun and is said to be responsible for solar and



178 6. The Realm of the Demigods
lunar eclipses. In many Puranas, Rahu has a counterpart called Ketu,
but Ketu is not mentioned in the Bhagavatam. In the Jyotisa Sastras,
Rahu and Ketu are identified with the nodes of the moon, and in some
Puranas Rahu is associated with the shadow of the earth (which is
therefore implied to be a globe). (For a further discussion, see Section
3.4.)
Beneath Rahu by 10,000 yojanas are the worlds known as Siddha
loka, Caranaloka and Vidyadharaloka (see 5.24.4). These are the
abodes of beings called Siddhas, Caranas, and Vidyadharas, who are
endowed with mystic powers and are able to fly through the ether on
their own power.
In the Bhagavatam, these worlds are simply listed and their
geometry is unclear. If we regard Bhu-mandala as a plane extending
across the Brahmanda-sphere, then these abodes might be anything
from parallel planes on a higher level, to small globes above Jambu
dvipa. In the planisphere model, they might map to spherical regions
surrounding the earth globe.
Below these worlds there are the abodes of the Yaksas, Raksasas,
Pisacas, Pretas, and Bhutas. These regions are said to lie at least 100
yojanas above the earth (about 800 miles), and it is also stated that the
upper limit of the earth is marked by how high large birds can fly (see
5.24.5-6).
The beings in this list are considered to be demonic or ghostly in
nature, and they are also said to be endowed with superhuman mystic

powers. The Bhagavatam seems to be saying that these beings live
overhead about 100 or more yojanas up, relative to our familiar earth
globe. For comparison, the American and Russian manned orbital
flights range in altitude from about 100 to 900 miles above the earth,
while the highest clouds are observed to lie about 50 miles up (Baker,
1981, pp. 534-536).
There is a possible cultural parallel between this account in the
Bhagavatam and the nursery story about Jack and the beanstalk. In
this story, Jack meets a giant who lives up in the clouds. The giant is a
man-eater, he has magical powers, and he hoards gold. These are
precisely the characteristics of the Puranic Raksasas. Thus the familiar
nursery tale may be a cultural fossil—a remnant of past cosmological
thinking that has survived in the harmless guise of a children’s story.
Directly below Bhu-mandala there are seven lower systems, called
Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Talatala, Mahatala, Rasatala and Patala (see
5.24.7.) These systems are described as chasms or openings in the earth
having a horizontal length and breadth of 10,000 yojanas. Each open¬
ing is said to lie 10,000 yojanas below the one above it, and Atala, the
first, lies 10,000 yojanas beneath Bhu-mandala. These seven chasms
are like a series of subbasements within Bhu-mandala. The Bhagavatam
does not say where they are located beneath Bhu-mandala, so we
arbitrarily placed them beneath Bharata-varsa in the illustration (Fig¬
ure 6.9).
The seven lower systems are collectively called Bila-svarga, which
means the “subterranean heaven.” They are described as being more
opulent materially than the heavens of the demigods. Like the inhab¬
itants of the heavenly portion of Jambudvipa, the inhabitants of Bila
svarga do not experience wrinkles, grey hair, or invalidity (see 5.24.13).
However, they are said to be extremely materialistic.
There are seven lower systems, one earth mandala, and six higher
systems (from Bhuvarloka to Satyaloka), making fourteen worlds in
total. Bhu-mandala is sometimes referred to as the middle system, and
thus one can refer to three worlds, lower, middle, and upper. How¬
ever, in some cases, the phrase “three worlds” refers to Bhu-mandala,
Bhuvarloka, and Svargaloka.
Bhu-mandala extends through the heavens and is known as Bhau
ma-svarga—the earthly heaven. Above it (towards celestial north) is
Divya-svarga, the heaven of Indra, and beneath are the cramped



180 6. The Realm of the Demigods
subbasements of Bila-svarga, the subterranean heaven.
In the Jyotisa Sastras such as Surya-siddhanta, the lower systems
are placed within the concave strata of the earth globe, and this is the
natural interpretation according to the planisphere model of Bhu
mandala. This is also consistent with the statement in Bhagavatam
verse 5.24.11 that there is no distinction between day and night in Bila
svarga since the sunlight does not reach there.
The idea that there are heavenly regions within the earth can be
found in many cultures, and we find stories in the Mahabharata
indicating that Bila-svarga can be reached by entering into a hole in the
earth (van Buitenen, 1973, p. 51). A cultural parallel from China is
discussed in Appendix 11. This example draws attention to the fact that
Bila-svarga, like other heavenly regions described in the Bhagavatam,
can best be understood as a parallel reality that is not part of our
ordinary three-dimensional continuum.
Patala is the lowest of the seven lower systems, and it is said to be
the abode of the mystical Nagas, cobra-like serpents that can also
assume human forms. The jewels decorating the hoods of these
serpents are said to emit an effulgence that illuminates the entire
region of Bila-svarga (see 5.24.31).
The Nagas are generally regarded as being angry and materialistic
in nature, but 30,000 yojanas beneath Patala is the abode of Lord
Ananta Sesa or Sankarsana. Ananta Sesa is described as a multi
• •• •
headed, cobra-like serpent who is an incarnation of Lord Visnu. He is
in charge of material false ego and the tamo-guna, or mode of darkness
(5.25.1). He also destroys the creation at the time of annihilation by
manifesting the Rudras in anger.
Sankarsana is said to support Bhu-golam, which is compared with
an atom resting on one of His hoods (5.25.12). At the same time,
Sankarsana is described as being within the Bhu-golam, or sphere of
the Brahmanda. This is not necessarily a contradiction. Rather, it is a
joining together of ideas that have to be viewed separately to be
understood (i.e. one must consider that different expansions of San
karsana are meant). Clearly, Sankarsana is not presented as an inhab¬
itant of our three-dimensional continuum.
Sankarsana is the object of meditation by Lord Siva and is said to
be the root cause of Lord Siva’s existence (5.17.16). Thus the root
cause of the material creation in serpent-form is placed beneath the

lowest of the worlds (as well as outside the entire system of worlds).
Another incarnation of Lord Visnu, named Garbhodakasayl Visnu,
is generally portrayed as resting on the coils of Ananta Sesa. Ananta
Sesa, in turn, floats on the waters of the Garbhodaka (Embryonic)
Ocean, which fills the lower hemisphere of the Brahmanda. According to
the Bhagavatam, Garbhodakasayl Visnu generates a lotus flower from
His navel. Brahma, the Creator, is born from this lotus, and Brahma
creates the fourteen lokas. The lotus stem represents the vertical dimen¬
sion of the Brahmanda, along which the lokas are situated.
The Brahmanda is thus portrayed as an egg within which the
creation is generated without hatching out. It includes an amniotic
region (the Garbhodaka Ocean), an umbilicus (the lotus stem), and a
developing embryo (the fourteen lokas).
If we look at Bhu-mandala as a three-dimensional model of the so¬
lar system, then the Garbhodaka Ocean consists of everything to the
celestial south of the ecliptic. This perspective is supported by the anal¬
ysis given by de Santillana and von Dechend of the cosmology of their
“archaic” culture, which supposed a watery region filling the southern
celestial hemisphere (see Appendix 3). Of course, Bhu-mandala lies
along the ecliptic, rather than the celestial equator, and all stars to the
south of the ecliptic must therefore lie within the Garbhodaka Ocean.



182 6. The Realm of the Demigods
It is noteworthy that, according to 3.8.19, Brahma tried to find
the root of the lotus from which he took birth, but he was unable to do
so by the power of his senses. This indicates that Ananta Sesa and
Garbhodakasayi Visnu are invisible even to Brahma, whose own
world is said to be beyond mind and words. Thus the two poles of
the vertical dimension, Satyaloka and the region of Ananta Sesa, are
both parallel realities lying beyond the reach of ordinary sense
perception.
The lotus of Lord Brahma corresponds to Satyaloka. An interest¬
ing analogy can be drawn between the cosmic axis of the Brahmanda,
with Ananta Sesa at the lower end and Satyaloka at the upper end, and
the human spinal column, with the kundalini “serpent” at the base, and
the lotuslike brahma-randhra at the top of the head. This is discussed
below in Section 6.3.1.
We should finally note that the upper and lower parts of the
vertical axis are linked by the celestial Ganges river. This river is said
to enter the Brahmanda through the hole kicked by Lord Vamanadeva,
to descend upon the earth, and to finally pass through the lower
systems and reach the Garbhodaka Ocean. This topic is discussed in
Section 6.3.2.
According to the Bhagavatam 5.26.5, the hells and the region
called Pitrloka are situated between the lower systems and the
Garbhodaka Ocean, on the southern side of Bhu-mandala. Pitrloka is
the headquarters of Yamaraja, the lord of the dead, who awards
punishment to sinful persons. In verse 5.21.7, Samyamam, the place of
Yamaraja, is said to be located on Manasottara Mountain in the
southern direction. However, this is not necessarily the location of
Pitrloka.
In Figure 6.9, Pitrloka and the hells have been placed above the
Garbhodaka Ocean, about 100,000 yojanas directly beneath the south¬
ernmost varsa of Jambudvipa (Bharata-varsa). This choice is sup¬
ported by the statement in verse 3.30.24 that the servants of Yamaraja
take souls to the hellish regions along a path that is 99,000 yojanas in
length.
Horrible tortures are prescribed for different categories of sinners
in the various hells, but it is said that internment in hell is not
permanent. It is also pointed out that beings suffer hellish punishments
in their subtle bodies. Thus, the idea that hell might exist is rendered



6.3 The Vertical Dimension 183
more plausible by the idea that hell is like a nightmare from which one
cannot awaken because one no longer has a gross physical body. The
Bhdgavatam clearly intends the hells as subtle regions that are not
directly manifest to gross vision.
Pitrloka is a heavenly region to which pious persons may attain
after death. These persons then assume the status of pitrs (forefa¬
thers), and they are concerned with the well-being of their earthly
families. In India and in other parts of the world, offerings have been
traditionally made to propitiate the forefathers or ancestral spirits.
According to H. H. Wilson, the pitrs “include a man’s ancestors;
but the principal members of this order of beings are of a different
origin” (Wilson, 1980, p. 463). They fall into seven classes: three classes
of beings without form who can assume forms at will, and four classes
of beings with fixed bodily forms. They are said to descend from sons
of the demigods who gave good instructions to their fathers at a time
when the demigods had offended Brahma. Therefore, they were
addressed by their fathers as fathers (pitrs).
It may be relevant to our understanding of Pitrloka to note
that many people in modern America (who are mostly of Christian
background) report out-of-body experiences in which they meet
departed relatives and “beings of light.” The light-beings may be
formless, or they may appear as religious figures such as Jesus Christ.
Thus Puranic ideas concerning Pitrloka are paralleled by rela¬
tively common forms of experience involving altered states of
consciousness.
In the Puranas, the pitrs are assigned a number of different living
places, in addition to Pitrloka proper. For example, the Agnisvattas
live in Somaloka, which appears to be the moon, and the Havismantas
live in the sun (Wilson, 1980, p. 464). The Bhdgavatam also connects
the pitrs indirectly with the moon, since it says that the two fortnights
of the waxing and waning moon constitute the day and night of the pitrs
(see 5.22.9).
The Puranas also give information placing the pitrs in outer space.
The Visnu Purana states that “On the north of Agastya, and south of
the line of the Goat, exterior to the Vaisvanara path, lies the road of
the Pitrs” (Wilson, 1980, p. 327). According to H. H. Wilson, the line
of the Goat, Ajavithi, comprises the naksatras Mula, Purvasadha, and
Uttarasadha, which contain stars in Scorpio and Sagittarius (Wilson,



184 6. The Realm of the Demigods
1980, p. 328). Agastya is the star Canopus in the southern celestial
hemisphere. (The terminology used to describe the groups of naksatras
is given in Appendix 1).
This suggests that the road of the pitrs was associated with an area
in outer space, including stars in Scorpio and Sagittarius. In Appendix
12, we mention several cultural traditions in which these constella¬
tions were connected with the world of the dead. This is consistent
with the identification of Bhu-mandala with the ecliptic. Scorpio
and Sagittarius are just south of the ecliptic, and Pitrloka is south of
Bhu-mandala.
6.3.1 Macrocosm and Microcosm
In the hermetic philosophy of the West, it is said that the micro¬
cosm corresponds to the macrocosm. Puranic cosmology expresses a
similar idea by viewing the universe as a bodily form of the Supreme
Being.
The universal form, or virat-purusa, is conceived of as the material
manifestation of the transcendental Godhead. In the Bhagavad-gita,
the universal form is portrayed as a reality that Arjuna was able to per¬
ceive through divine vision. In other accounts, it is described by assign¬
ing parts of the Lord’s body to parts of the universe. In these descrip

tions, the word “imaginary” (kalpitah) is sometimes used. This indi¬
cates that the particular description of the universal form is intended
as an aid to meditation on the Lord, but it is not to be taken literally.
The Bhagavatam verses 2.5.38-41 present one of these imaginary
accounts. They associate the fourteen worlds of the universe with parts
of the Lord’s body as shown in Table 6.3:
TABLE 6.3
Parts of the Universal Form
World Part of the Lord's Body
Satyaloka head
Tapoloka neck
Janaloka breast (upper chest)

Svarloka chest
Bhuvarloka navel
Bhu-mandala waist
Atala waist
Vitala thighs
Sutala knees
Talatala shanks
Mahatala ankles
Rasatala upper portion of feet
Patala soles of feet
Thus the vertical axis of the universe is made to correspond to the
personal form of the Lord. An analogy is sometimes made between
this axis, with its graded series of heavens, and the spinal cakras on
which yogis meditate. In this analogy, Bhu-mandala corresponds to
the lowest cakra and Satyaloka corresponds to the thousand-petaled
brahma-randhra at the top of the head. The lower worlds correspond¬
ing to the legs of the universal form do not play a role in this analogy,
but the serpent Ananta Sesa may correspond to the kundalini at the
base of the spine. In the illustration, we have paired the seven cakras
with the corresponding higher lokas, starting at the top with Satyaloka
and ending with Bhu-mandala.



186 6. The Realm of the Demigods
In his essay on Indian cartography, Joseph Schwartzberg de¬
scribed one way in which the analogy between the spine and the
cosmic axis is used in processes of meditation. By contemplating this
analogy, meditators “further the process by which one’s self becomes
a microcosm that fuses and becomes one with the enveloping macro¬
cosm. One’s spine then becomes the Meru or axis mundi of both.
Arrayed along the spine are various centers of psychic energy that
one summons up, in the practice of yoga, in moving toward the
supremely illuminated samadhi state. These energy centers may be
viewed as the psychophysiological analogues of the heavens that the
soul traverses on its path to ultimate liberation .. .” (Schwartzberg,
1987, p. 381).
In accordance with this analogy, the spine is called merudanda in
Sanskrit texts on yoga. This topic is discussed extensively in Snodgrass
(1990, pp. 158-64).
6.3.2 The Descent of the Ganges
The descent of the Ganges river from heaven to earth provides a
map of the vertical dimension of the Puranic universe. According to
the Bhagavatam verse 5.17.1, the Ganges consists of water from the
Causal Ocean which entered the upper portion of the universe through
a hole kicked in the universal covering by Lord Vamanadeva. This
water is said to take about a thousand yugas (yuga-sahasra-upa
laksanena) to reach Dhruvaloka (the polestar), which is said to be situ¬
ated approximately thirty million miles above the sun. Jiva Goswami
says that, by the usage of the Jyoti-sastra, yuga is to be taken here as five
years. This implies that the descent onto Dhruvaloka takes 5,000 years.
From Dhruvaloka, the Ganges reaches the stars of the Seven Sages
(Sapta-rsi), and from there it is carried to the moon “through the
spaceways of the demigods” (devayanena) in billions of celestial
airplanes. From the moon it falls down (nipatati) to the top of mount
Meru, where it divides into four branches in the cardinal directions
(5.17.4-5). Finally, the southernmost branch, called the Alakananda,
passes from Brahmapurl over the tops of many mountains and be¬
comes the Ganges of India (5.17.9).
We have the sequence: Dhruvaloka, Sapta-rsi, moon, top of
Mount Meru. Since Meru and Dhruvaloka define the polar axis, and



6.3 The Vertical Dimension 187
the Big Dipper (Sapta-rsi) is a northern constellation, this seems to
put the moon close to celestial north. However, the moon stays
within about 5° of the ecliptic and therefore is never further north
than about 28.5°. The motion ascribed to the descending Ganges
clearly does not follow obvious physical principles if we try to
understand it in three dimensions.
The Puranic star lore may give us some insight into the path of the
celestial Ganges. This leads us to seek the Ganges’ course across the
celestial sphere, where the stars are projected.
First of all, the phrase “spaceways of the demigods” refers to the
deva-ydna path, which is discussed in Appendix 12. This path is defined
roughly in the Visnu Purana in terms of star positions ranging from the
Sapta-rsi constellation to parts of Aries and Taurus. It lies to the north
of the ecliptic plane, and its northernmost terminus, Sapta-rsi, is one
of the way stations of the celestial Ganges. Following the celestial
sphere, we see that the Ganges might well pass from the north pole
(Dhruvaloka) to Sapta-rsi, and from there to the moon’s orbit in the
vicinity of the ecliptic.
In their comparative study of ancient mythologies, de Santillana
and von Dechend commented on “that curious archaic intrication of
earth and heaven which has become familiar and which makes great
rivers flow from heaven to earth” (de Santillana, 1969, p. 188). The
“intrication of earth and heaven” is there in the concept of Bhu
mandala, which is both earth and heaven. Taking the earth as the
ecliptic plane, the celestial Ganges falls down to the earth, and taking
Figure 6.12

Ganges onto the city

summit of Mount

into four branches.



188 6. The Realm of the Demigods
it as this terrestrial globe, the Ganges flows through India. The link
connecting the celestial and terrestrial rivers involves the heavenly
varsas of Jambudvipa.
First of all, the celestial Ganges is said to fall on the summit of
Mount Meru. In Figure 6.12 we show it precipitating on the center
of Brahmapuri and dividing into four branches. After falling upon
various mountains in Jambudvipa, one branch of the Ganges descends
onto the head of Lord Siva in the Himalayas and then enters India as
a visible river. This is a classical example of mystical travel, involving
a shift from a parallel reality to the world perceived by our ordinary
senses.
There are other mystical features of the Ganges. For example, the
Bhagavatam verse 3.8.5 describes a visit by Sanat-kumara and other
sages to Lord Sankarsana, in the region of the Garbhodaka Ocean.
Srila A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada commented as follows
on the sages’ mode of transportation:
The Ganges water flows directly from the lotus feet of Visnu, and its
course runs from the highest planet of the universe down to the lowest.
The sages came down from Satyaloka by taking advantage of the flowing
water, a process of transportation made possible by the power of mystic
yoga. If a river flows thousands and thousands of miles, a perfect yogi can
at once transport himself from one place to another simply by dipping in
its water. The Ganges is the only celestial river which flows throughout
the universe, and great sages travel all over the universe via this sacred
river.
The general rule seems to be that a terrestrial river may have a
celestial river as its counterpart. These exist in distinct domains (earth
and heaven), and they cannot interconnect by ordinary means. But
there is connection involving parallel worlds and mystic siddhis.
This applies not only to the Ganges but to other major rivers in
India. For example, the Bhagavatam verse 6.10.16 describes a celestial
battle between the armies of Indra and those of the demon Vrtrasura:
Thereafter, at the end of Satya-yuga and the beginning of Treta-yuga,
a fierce battle took place between the demigods and the demons on the
bank of the Narmada.



6.4 Gods, Demons, and Astronomy 189
Prabhupada commented that,
Herein, the Narmada does not mean the Narmada River in India. The
five sacred rivers in India—Gaiiga, Yamuna, Narmada, Kaveri and
Krsna—are all celestial. Like the Ganges River, the Narmada River also
flows in the higher planetary systems.
This implies that in addition to the earthly India, with its five sacred
rivers, there is also a corresponding celestial India. As we pointed out
above, this is required by the interpretation of Jambudvlpa as a
heavenly region. This interpretation implies a heavenly and an earthly
Bharata-varsa, linked by mystic travel.
6.4 GODS, DEMONS, AND ASTRONOMY
One may ask how scientific information about astronomy can
coexist with stories of gods and demons in the Puranas and in other
traditions. The astronomical phenomena are recognized to occur in a
regular way. In contrast, the behavior of the gods and demons seems
to depend on personal whims and irreproducible events which wouldn’t
be expected to follow a regulated timetable.
A common explanation is that primitive people saw things as the
unpredictable behavior of whimsical gods. Later on, their more scien¬
tific descendants recognized lawful patterns in nature, but retained the
gods as a matter of tradition. However, whatever the historical steps
leading to a tradition may have been, the question remains as to how
people reconciled gods and deterministic laws.
Modern philosophy is based on the assumption that only the laws
of physics are real, and all other levels of meaning are nothing but
combinations of words. In contrast, an older approach to philosophy
attributes real existence to many different philosophical categories,
including categories involving consciousness and psychology. This
approach tends to give meaning to the relation between the individual
and the universe, whereas the modern approach sees such meaning
simply as a matter of psychological projection.
In one sense, the conflict between whimsical gods and regular laws
becomes irreconcilable only when one adopts a purely mechanistic
view of cause and effect. Then the gods and the laws become competing

systems of mechanical causation, and it is hard to accommodate both
of them. But if a richer system of philosophical categories is allowed,
the restrictions imposed by strict mechanical causation are relaxed,
and attention is focused on a wide variety of meaningful relationships.
The story of the klrttimukha illustrates how this works in Indian
cosmology. South Indian temples are typically surmounted by a mon¬
strous visage without a lower jaw that seems to contain within its mouth
everything beneath it. This is called the klrttimukha or “Face of
Glory,” and its origin is recounted in the Siva Purana (Siva, 1990,
pp. 886-90). It seems that the demon Jalandhara, after conquering the
three worlds, decided that he should possess Siva’s wife Parvati, and he
sent Rahu to Siva to convey his demand. On hearing this demand, Siva
projected a horrific monster from the space between his eyebrows and
it rushed to devour Rahu. Rahu begged Siva for mercy and was spared,
but the monster objected that he was tormented by hunger and
desperately needed something to eat. On Siva’s order, the being
devoured its own body up to the head, and Siva, being pleased with
him, declared that he would be his doorkeeper and would be known as
klrttimukha.
How are we to understand this story? According to Snodgrass
(1985, pp. 305-9), the klrttimukha involves many levels of symbolic
meaning. These include



6.4 Gods, Demons, and Astronomy 191
1. The kirttimukha is also the kalamukha or face of time, and to pass
beneath his jaws is to be devoured by time.
2. The jaws represent all-devouring death, but they also spew forth
foliage representing new life.
3. Rahu is also a decapitated head, and he is identified with kirttimukha.
Here there is a link with the sun, which is also the all-devourer and all¬
producer.
4. The link with Rahu also refers to the ascending and descending nodes
of the moon. These are connected with Rahu’s role as the eclipse that
represents death by covering the light of the sun and moon.
5. The kirttimukha is portrayed as a partly a makara, an aquatic monster.
This links him with the zodiac and makara sankranti, the winter sol¬
stice. Thus the theme of creation and destruction is mirrored in the as¬
cending and descending paths of the sun (udagayana and daksinayana).
6. Rahu was decapitated by Visnu just as he began to taste the amrta
produced by the churning of the Milk Ocean. In temple iconography,
the dripping down of the amrta from the mouth of the kirttimukha is
represented by cascades of jewels. Thus to pass through the doorway
beneath the kirttimukha is to be bathed in the rain of amrta.
7. There is an analogy with the yoga system, in which the pairs of
opposites represented by ida and pingala merge in the coincidentia
oppositorum in the cerebral cakra and generate the amrta, which
descends through the body and purifies it. The kirttimukha, exuding
elixer. is stationed above the lintel of the door, and the channels of ida
and pingala are represented by serpents, wreathed with flames and
vegetation, that extend along the doorjambs from its mouth and
terminate in makara heads.
8. There is a link between the kirttimukha and the sisumara or “child
killer,” stationed in the heavens, “who lies in wait with jaws agape and
turned counter-current against the river of the sacrificer’s path leading
to the celestial regions” (Snodgrass, 1985, p. 310). Note that the tail of
the sisumara is Dhruvaloka, the place of Visnu, and note also that the
head of the sisumara was intended to be oriented on the winter solstice
(see Section 8.2.1). The basic concept is that “he who would pass
beyond the Sun Door must be devoured, his selfhood swallowed,
offered in a willing act of sacrifice. Then the other, glorious side of the
Mask is revealed. . . . The other side of the monster’s mask is the Face
of Glory” (Snodgrass, 1985, p. 309).
We can see that the various interpretations of the kirttimukha refer
to universal principles, such as time, creation, and destruction, that
relate to the universe as a whole and to the individual as a conscious



192 6. The Realm of the Demigods
being. Since these principles are regarded as real entities, they cannot
be reduced to a linear sequence of mechanical causes and effects.
Rather, they lend themselves to a multicontextual view of reality, in
which the universe is seen as an ultimately incomprehensible whole
with many meaningful aspects. Since the universe is thought to be
based on consciousness, Siva (and even the kirttimukha) are regarded
as real, but they are not thought to exist in a simplistic, mechanical way
as arrangements of moving parts in space.
This approach may tend to inhibit the development of consistent
mechanical models of the modern scientific type. At the same time, it
must be said that the effort to impose a single mechanical model on all
of reality (a TOE or “theory of everything”) may be unrealistic in its
own right. There are phenomena such as consciousness that are
notoriously hard to fit into such a scheme, and there is the danger that
important aspects of reality may be suppressed or overlooked in an
effort to achieve mechanistic consistency. There may still be room for
a multicontextual approach.



The Greater Universe
7.1 DISTANCES TO THE STARS
In the Bhagavatam, there are relatively few references to stars.
The twenty-eight naksatras are mentioned in 5.22.11 and are said to be
200,000 yojanas above the moon (300,000 in some texts). In Section
3.4, we argue that this statement does not give a literal distance to the
naksatra stars. Rather, it places the naksatra plane above the moon’s
plane in a planisphere model. This is appropriate, since the naksatras
are stations marking the daily motion of the moon in its orbit. (They
are therefore sometimes called lunar mansions. See Appendix 1.)
In some Indian systems, the ecliptic is divided into twenty-seven
equal naksatra intervals, and the moon stays a little over a day in each
one. In another system, a smaller interval is assigned to a twenty-eighth
naksatra (Abhijit), so that the moon stays one day in each of twenty
seven naksatras and about .3 days in the twenty-eighth (Dikshit, 1888).
This means that the naksatras serve as a system of markers that can
be used to measure time using the motion of the moon. The naksatra
intervals are associated with star constellations, and one can determine
what naksatra the moon is in by observing the stars near the moon.
In this application, the distances to the naksatra stars in three
dimensional space are not important. What is important is that the
naksatras form a backdrop in 2-D against which the motion of the
moon can be measured. Therefore, it is significant that the naksatras
are placed in the layer just above the moon in 5.22.11. This is like
placing the plate with hour markings just behind the hands of a clock.
The stars called the Seven Sages (Sapta-rsi) are placed 1,100,000
yojanas above Saturn in 5.22.17, and the polestar Dhruvaloka is placed
1,300,000 yojanas above the Seven Sages in 5.23.1. These locations can
also be understood in terms of the planisphere model. According to the
193



194 7. The Greater Universe
Visnu Purana, Dhruvaloka also marks the upper boundary of Antariksa
(the “inner space” in which the sun, moon, and planets orbit) and the
lower boundary of Svargaloka (Wilson, 1980, p. 307).
The Seven Sages, Dhruvaloka, and the stars making up the Sisumara
constellation are treated in the Bhdgavatam as markers indicating the
passage of time. The daily rotation of the stars and planets around the
polestar, Dhruvaloka, is strongly stressed in 5.23.2 and 5.23.3. We can
directly see this rotation at night, and it is compared to the turning of
a great wheel (the kala-cakra), measuring time. The Sisumara is
referred to as an incarnation of Krsna (who says “Time I am”), and it
is an object of meditation by yogis. Thus the Sisumara is like a great
clock representing Krsna as the time factor.
The Bhdgavatam does not refer to stellar distances of many light
years, as understood by modern astronomy. Specific references to
stellar distances are part of an astrolabelike structure in which stars
play the roles of markers in a cosmic clock. Apart from this, the
Purdnas indicate that the stars are nearby and that they shine by the
reflected light of the sun. In this sense, it could be said that the Purdnas
are too heliocentric (see Section 4.6).
7.1.1 Distant Stars in the Mahahharata
However, we do find indications in traditional Sanskrit literature
that the stars are far away—so far that, if we traveled to the stars, we
could not see the sun or the moon due to their great distance. For
example, the Mahabharata tells how the hero Arjuna traveled to the
kingdom of Indra to obtain celestial weapons. On the way there, he
passes through the region of the stars:
And on this sunlike, divine, wonder-working chariot the wise scion of
Kuru flew joyously upward. While becoming invisible to the mortals who
walk on earth, he saw wondrous airborne chariots by the thousands. No
sun shone there, or moon, or fire, but they shone with a light of their own
acquired by their merits. Those lights that are seen as the stars look tiny
like oil flames because of the distance, but they are very large. The
Pandava saw them bright and beautiful, burning on their own hearths
with a fire of their own. There are the perfected royal seers, the heroes cut
down in war, who, having won heaven with their austerities, gather in
hundreds of groups. So do thousands of Gandharvas with a glow like the



7.1 Distances to the Stars 195
sun's or the fire’s, and of Guhyakas and seers and the hosts of Apsaras.
Beholding those self-luminous worlds, Phalguna [Arjuna], aston¬
ished, questioned Matali in a friendly manner, and the other said to him,
‘Those are men of saintly deeds, ablaze on their own hearths, whom you
saw there, my lord, looking like stars from earth below.’ Then he saw
standing at the gateway the victorious white elephant, four-tusked
Airavata, towering like peaked Kailasa. Driving on the roadway of the
Siddhas, that most excellent Kuru Pandava shone forth as of old the
great king Mandhatar. The lotus-eyed prince passed by the worlds of the
kings, then looked upon Amaravati, the city of Indra (van Buitenen,
1975, p. 308).
One important thing to notice about this passage is that Arjuna
entered a region of stars where there was no light from the sun, the
moon, or fire. This is what we would expect to find if we did travel
among the stars. It is also stated that the stars are very large, but they
seem small due to distance when seen from the earth. This also agrees
with modern ideas.
In that region, Arjuna saw that the stars were self-luminous worlds,
and that they were inhabited by various kinds of beings. The stars
themselves are spoken of as aerial chariots, and this is reminiscent of
the “billions of celestial airplanes” (vimana-anika) that carry the water
of the celestial Ganges (see 5.17.4-5). Thus we see modern-sounding
ideas combined with expressions of the Puranic picture of a universe
thronging with life.
7.1.2 Expanding the Brahmanda
We find quantitative indications of vast stellar distances in the
Jyotisa Sastras, which are generally assigned by scholars to the medi¬
eval period. For example, the Surya-siddhanta 12.90 says that “The
circumference of the sphere of the Brahmandee in which the sun’s rays
spread is 18,712,080,864,000,000 yojanas” (Sastri, 1860, p. 87). Like¬
wise, the Siddhanta-siromani, Goladhyaya Bhuvana-kosa, states:
Some astronomers have asserted the circumference of the circle of
heaven to be 18,712,069,200,000,000yojanas in length. Some say this is the
length of the zone binding the two hemispheres of the Brahmanda. Some
Pauranikas say that this is the length of the circumference of the Lokaloka
Parvata [adrsya-drsyaka-girim] (Wilkinson, 1861, p. 126).



196 7. The Greater Universe
The circumference of 18,712,069,200,000,000 yojanas corresponds
to a diameter of 5,956,200,000,000,000 yojanas. Arguments based on
the earth’s diameter show that the Surya-siddhanta and the Siddhanta
siromani use a yojana of about five miles (see Section 3.4.2), and there¬
fore these figures can be converted into miles by multiplying by five.
According to the Bhagavatam 5.20.37, the circular Lokaloka Moun¬
tain is the outer limit of the rays of the luminaries, including the sun.
This explains why some Pauranikas (expounders of the Puranas)
would say that the eighteen quadrillion yojanas refer to the circumfer¬
ence of Lokaloka Mountain. Since Lokaloka Mountain has half the
diameter of the Brahmanda, the radius of the Brahmanda comes to
5 x 5.956 = 29.78 quadrillion miles, or about 5,065 light years.
According to modern astronomers, the Milky Way galaxy is about
100,000 light years across. It follows that the sphere of the Brahmanda
has a diameter about Vio that of the Milky Way galaxy, with room for
large numbers of stars. In the illustration, this is shown by the sphere
superimposed on a galaxy representing the Milky Way.
The eighteen-quadrilhon-voymttf figure is computed as the orbital
distance traveled by the moon in a day of Brahma, which lasts
4,320,000,000 years. We do not need to take this speculative calcula¬
tion seriously. But it is worth noting that Indian astronomers were
discussing distances equivalent to thousands of light years at a time
when European astronomy assigned the fixed stars to a shell lying just
outside the orbit of Saturn.
In the twentieth century, some Vaisnava commentators have
invoked the Surya-siddhanta and Siddhanta-siromani to revise the
Figure 7.1 The enlarged Brahmanda of the Surya-siddhanta, shown as a gray
sphere in comparison with the Milky Way galaxy.

diameter of the Brahmanda given in the Bhagavatam. The Caitanya
caritdmrta is the biography of the sixteenth-century saint Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, written by Krsnadasa Kaviraja. According to text 21.84
of the Madhya-lila section of this work, Krsna said to Brahma:
Your particular universe extends four billion miles; therefore it is the
smallest of all the universes. Consequently, you have only four heads.
In his commentary written in the 1970s, Srila A. C. Bhaktivedanta
Swami Prabhupada remarked:
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, one of the greatest astrolo¬
gers of his time, gives information from Siddhanta-siromani that this
universe measures 18,712,069,200,000,000x8 miles. This is the circumfer¬
ence of this universe. According to some, this is only half the circumference.
This refers to the Anubhasya commentary on Caitanya-caritdmrta
by Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, in which he cites the verses from
Surya-siddhanta and Siddhanta-siromani quoted above. Evidently,
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta thought it was admissible to attribute a greatly
enlarged size to the Brahmanda, using the expanded distances given in
Jyotisa Sastras. Note that “according to some’1 the indicated figure is
only half the circumference. This is clearly a reference to Lokaloka
mountain, as mentioned in the text of the Siddhanta-siromani quoted
above. Thus the 18-quadrillion-y<9/2m<2 figure refers to the Brahmanda
itself and not to its coverings, as some have supposed.
7.2 THE UNIVERSAL GLOBE AND BEYOND
According to the Bhagavatam, the Brahmanda consists of a spheri¬
cal inner portion 500 million yojanas in diameter, enclosed in a series
of seven coverings made from the material elements described in
sahkhya philosophy. The inner portion extends to about twice the
orbit of Saturn, and the covering shells are said to be surrounded by a
purely spiritual region known as the Causal Ocean.
This arrangement can be compared with Renaissance and medi¬
eval cosmological diagrams from Europe, in which the sphere of the
fixed stars lies just outside the orbit of Saturn, the most distant known
planet. Beyond the fixed stars, lies the sphere of the Prime Mover and

then the unlimited empyrean realm (believed in ancient times to be
made of the pure fire element).
The Puranic Brahmanda can be seen as a system of higher-dimen¬
sional heavenly worlds, combined with an astronomically reasonable
model of the solar system. Unlike the medieval European system,
the Brahmanda is large enough to accommodate the orbit of Saturn,
which lies near the circular Lokaloka Mountain, the outer limit of the
luminaries.
As we have seen, much larger distances—up to a tenth of the
radius of the Milky Way galaxy—have been contemplated by Indian
astronomers and seriously considered by modern commentators on
the Bhdgavatam. However, the general view of followers of the Bhd¬
gavatam is that all visible bodies in the universe lie within the 500
million-yojana sphere of the Brahmanda.
The Bhdgavatam does not give a systematic explanation of the
seven shells covering the Brahmanda. It makes passing references to
them in a number of places, but it does not mention them in the main
cosmological discussion in the Fifth Canto. This conveys the impres¬
sion that the coverings were taken for granted as common knowledge
in the Bhdgavatam, but they were not considered to be an integral part
of the cosmology of the Brahmanda.



7.2 The Universal Globe and Beyond 199
In 2.1.25, 3.26.51-2, 3.29.43, 3.32.9, and 6.16.37, there are refer¬
ences to seven shells, but these are not actually enumerated anywhere
in the text. In 6.16.37, the shells are said to start with earth, but in
3.26.52 they are said to go from water to pradhana, the undifferenti¬
ated material energy.
In 3.32.9, the coverings are listed as earth, water, fire, air, ether,
mind, senses (indriya), sense objects (artha), ego, etc. However, this
list of at least nine elements does not clearly refer to geometrical shells
covering the Brahmanda. It may also refer to the material elements
covering conscious souls within the Brahmanda. (The role of these
sahkhya elements within the Brahmanda is discussed in Section 6.2.)
In the sixteenth-century work Sri Brihat Bhagavatamritam, the
coverings are listed as being made of earth, water, light, air, ether, ego,
mahat-tattva, and prakrti, coming to eight in total (Goswami, 1975,
p. 135). There it is stated that variegated activities take place within
each shell. Each shell is presided over by a demigoddess, beginning
with the earth goddess, Bhumi, in the first shell and ending with
Prakrti, the personified material energy, in the last. A yogi who is
trying to attain liberation by leaving the material universe is presented
with temptations within each shell, which he must overcome in order
to continue his journey.
In 2.2.28, it is explained that a yogi leaving the material world may
pass through stages described as earthly, watery, fiery, airy, and
ethereal. It is noteworthy that the sahkhya philosophy holds that these
elements are created in the reverse order, and each successive element
is defined by a new quality that was not present in the element before
it. Thus the yogi, in effect, reverses the creation as he frees himself from
the material elements.
The sahkhya theory of creation implies that the shells of the Brah¬
manda can be seen as nested spheres. Within a sphere of ether, a
smaller sphere is given an additional quality (touch or sparsa tanmatra),
and this produces a sphere of air. Within this sphere, a still smaller
sphere is given an additional quality (form), and this produces a sphere
of fire. In this way, a series of shells is produced, surrounding an inner
sphere of earth, in which all of the qualities of matter are manifested.
The Brahmanda lies within this sphere.
In 3.11.41, 3.26.52, and 6.16.37, it is mentioned that each succes¬
sive shell is ten times as thick as the shell within it. The thickness of the

are said to float in
the Causal Ocean.
Figure 7.3
Innumerable
first shell is not mentioned, but A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada
comments on 3.11.41 that its thickness is ten times the diameter of the
Brahmanda. If this is so, and the Brahmanda has a diameter of D, then
the outer radius of the seventh shell comes to D times 11,111,110.5.
Thus if the outermost shell is scaled to the size of the earth, the sphere
of the Brahmanda will be about four feet across.
From a modern point of view, there is something attractive about
the idea of successive condensations of elements within a nested series
of spheres. It is reminiscent of the big bang theory, in which a series of
symmetry breakings brings about the physical world as we know it. We
can think of the successive manifestations of the sahkhya elements as
a series of symmetry breakings in which successive properties are
added to material nature. Thus there are parallels between modern
cosmological speculation and Puranic cosmology.
Large though the shells of the Brahmanda may be, they are minute
compared with the larger world lying outside. There are many Brah¬
mandas, and 3.11.41 compares them with “atoms in a huge combina¬
tion.” In 6.16.37, they are likewise compared with atoms, and they are
said to number in the ten millions of ten millions (anda koti kotibhih).
These universes are floating in the Causal Ocean (kdrandrnavah
jala), and they emanated from the pores and breathing of Maha-Visnu.
This same Causal Ocean is said to be the source of the celestial Ganges,
which enters the Brahmanda through a hole kicked in the shells by
Lord Vamanadeva (see 5.17.1).



7.2 The Universal Globe and Beyond 201
We may observe that in recent years modern cosmologists have
contemplated a multiplicity of universes. This idea has come up in the
context of the big bang theory and the inflationary universe scenario.
For example, the Russian physicist Andrei Linde has proposed a
theory in which universes are continuously being born from quantum
fluctuations in the underlying “space-time foam.” The main difference
between Linde’s ideas and Bhagavata cosmology is that the latter
attributes the seed-universes to a divine source, while Linde’s theory
attributes them to random fluctuations based on the quantum me¬
chanical uncertainty principle. Thus Bhagavata cosmology is driven by
an underlying theological world view, whereas modern cosmology is
driven by an underlying theory of physics.






Notes on line and Chronology
8.1 PRECESSION AND THE POLESTAR
The theory of precession of the equinoxes states that the spin axis
of the earth moves slowly around in a conical path, centered on the
pole of the ecliptic. At present, the spin axis is nearly pointing at the
star Polaris, which we call the polestar. However, prior to a few centuries
ago, Polaris was not near the north celestial pole. Within the last few
thousand years, the last time there was a notable polestar was about
2500 B.C., when Thuban (Alpha Draconis) was near the north pole.
Thus Hipparchus, in about 150 B.C., said that “As regards the
north pole, Eudoxus is in error in stating that ‘there is a certain star
which always remains at the same spot’” (Kay, 1981, p. 13). There
was no polestar in the time of Hipparchus, but Eudoxus may have

204 8. Notes on Time and Chronology
been following a tradition dating back to the time when Thuban was
at the pole.
In India, there are strong traditions of a fixed polestar which may
also date back to this period. For example, the Surya-siddhanta advo¬
cates a theory of trepidation, in which the equinoxes shift slowly back
and forth by plus or minus 27° (see Appendix 16). However, it does
not say what effect these oscillations might have on the polestar, and
it defines two fixed polestars (dhruvatara) on the northern and
southern ends of the Meru axis (Burgess, 1860, p. 286).
The Bhagavatam verse 5.23.3 states that the planets and stars
revolve around Dhruvaloka, the polestar, until the end of the creation
(,a-kalpa-antam). “Dhruva” literally means “fixed” in Sanskrit, and
thus precession is not recognized in the Bhagavatam. This assumes, of
course, that the tradition of a fixed polestar was based originally on
observable stars and not simply on the abstract idea of a celestial body
marking the cosmic axis. If Dhruvaloka were simply defined as the
polar axis, then by definition, it would always be perfectly fixed.
Although the Bhagavatam does not recognize smooth precession
of the equinoxes, the idea of an abrupt displacement of the polestar
is present in Indian tradition. For example, the modern poet and
spiritual teacher, Bhaktivinoda Thakura, used the shifting of the pole
star to illustrate the transitory nature of material existence:
Beings still greater than these have passed away—vast oceans have
dried, mountains have been thrown down, the polar star displaced, the
cords that bind the planets rent asunder, the whole earth deluged with
flood—in such a world what relish can there be in fleeting enjoyments?
(Bhaktivinoda, 1968, p. 18)
This is reminiscent of a passage in the Markandeya Purdna, in
which the sun is being pared down on a kind of celestial lathe because
he has become unbearably brilliant:
And Visvakarman, being permitted by the Sun in Sakadvipa, mounted
the Sun on his chariot wheel and set to work to pare down his glory. While
the Sun, which was the center of all the worlds, was whirling around, the
earth with its oceans, mountains and forests mounted up into the sky, and
the whole heavens with the moon, planets and stars went downward, and
were tossed together and confused. .. . And all creatures also were



8.1 Precession and the Polestar 205
scattered about with the waters out of the ocean; lofty hills were shattered
to pieces, their summits and roots were torn asunder. The supports of
the pole, all the asterisms, O best of munis, with their bands and founda¬
tions splitting, went downwards in thousands (Pargiter, 1981, pp. 569-70).
These stories bring to mind a theory propounded by the scholars
Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend. They maintain that
precession of the equinoxes was known in ancient times, but it was
expressed in terms of violent catastrophes, rather than being viewed
as a gradual process (de Santillana, 1969). Their prime example of such
a catastrophe is the universal Flood, which is mentioned in traditions
from all over the world. They argue that the end of an age, marked by
the shifting of the equinox into a new sign of the zodiac, was believed
to end in such a universal Deluge.
The steady shifting of the equinox by about 1° in seventy-two
years hardly seems violent, and it certainly doesn’t bring about
flooding on earth. However, the slow catastrophes of de Santillana
and von Dechend take place not on the earth, but in the heavens. The
link between precession and flooding is the cosmic ocean, defined as
occupying the space south of the plane of the celestial equator. As the
equinoxes shift, one constellation of the zodiac will gradually rise
from this ocean on the side of the vernal equinox, and another will
gradually sink into the ocean on the side of the autumnal equinox.
This sinking is the cosmic Flood, and although it is almost impercep¬
tibly slow, it eventually results in a complete change in what people
would see in the morning sky at particular times of the year.
Since agriculture depended on using stars to time the planting and
harvesting of crops, a complete change of the morning constellations
in relation to the seasons would have had a significant impact on the
long-entrenched customs of ancient agricultural peoples. This leads to
two possibilities: One is that people remained unaware of the idea of
precession, but that they unavoidably became aware at certain points
in history that their old customs were out of sync with the seasons.
Then they made drastic reforms and spoke of an abrupt transition to
a new age. Another possibility, favored by de Santillana and von
Dechend, is that real knowledge of precession did exist in an intellec¬
tual elite in ancient times, but they expressed it in terms of cata¬
strophic upheaval of the world order.



206 8. Notes on Time and Chronology
Myths of cosmic catastrophe are often so vivid and dramatic that
it is enough to make one wonder whether literal “dis-asters” have
actually happened here on earth. The statements of Bhaktivinoda
Thakura and the Markandeya Purana can be compared with the
following flood story from China, reported by the pioneer British
Indologist Sir William Jones in 1801:
The Chinese believe the Earth to have been wholly covered with
water, which, in works of undisputed authenticity, they describe as
flowing abundantly, then subsiding and separating the higher from the
lower ages of mankind.... The pillars of heaven were broken; the earth
shook to its very foundations; the heavens sunk lower to the north; the
Sun, the Moon, and the stars changed their motions; the Earth fell to
pieces, and the waters enclosed within its bosom burst forth with violence
and overflowed it. Man having rebelled against Heaven, the system of the
Universe was totally disordered. The Sun was eclipsed, the planets
altered their course, and the grand harmony of nature was destroyed
(Jones, 1801).
8.2 PRECESSION AND THE DATING OF TEXTS
The Bhagavata Parana 5.21.4 states that “When the sun passes
through Mesa and Tula, the durations of day and night are equal.”
Likewise, the Visnu Purana [II.8.70-73] states that the equinoxes take
place when the sun enters the first degrees of Mesa and Tula (Wilson,
1980, p. 325). Mesa and Tula are Sanskrit names for the signs of the
zodiac called Aries and Libra, respectively (see Section 3.3).
Due to precession, the equinoxes slowly shift relative to the con¬
stellations of the zodiac. However, they may not shift relative to the
signs of the zodiac. In the tropical zodiac, the beginning of the sign
Aries is defined to be the vernal equinox and the signs therefore move
with the equinoxes. In a sidereal zodiac, the signs are fixed to the
constellations.
Historically, the twelve constellations of the zodiac were named
first and the signs were chosen as 30° divisions of the ecliptic corre¬
sponding to these constellations. These developments are thought to
have taken place in the Near East. Initially, the signs were fixed to the
constellations, but after Hipparchus discovered precession of the equi¬
noxes, Greek astronomers invented a tropical zodiac. This is still used



8.2 Precession and the Dating of Texts 207
today in Western countries, and the zodiacal signs are gradually shift¬
ing further and further relative to the original zodiacal constellations.
We can estimate the earliest date for the adoption of the tropical
zodiac by asking when the 30° signs line up with the constellations
which were their original inspiration. For example, Leo is a well
defined constellation stretching about 30° from the star Regulus to the
star Denebola. If this constellation is required to line up with the fifth
30° sign, then the equinox was in the beginning of Aries between A.D.
100 and 100 B.C. If we do the same experiment with constellation
Scorpio, we get similar results.
This agrees reasonably well with the date of about 150 B.C. for
Hipparchus. The tropical zodiac used in the Bhagavatam could be this
old but not much older. The reason is that as we move back in time
before 100 B.C., the signs, shifting in reverse, gradually move ahead
of the constellations that they are named after. This means that each
sign would have a name that would become appropriate only in the
future, when the sign lined up with its constellation.
It may be that the Bhagavata and Visnu Purdnas (or their under¬
lying traditions) were updated astronomically at some time near the
beginning of the Christian era by introduction of the tropical zodiac
inherited from Hipparchus. Their statements about the zodiac cannot
date back much earlier, due to the problem of misalignment of signs
and constellations. However, these Purdnas also contain much older
material. For example, the Visnu Purana states that
When the sun, most excellent sage, is in the first degree of the lunar
mansion, Krttika, and the moon is in the fourth of Vishakha; or when the
sun is in the third degree of Vishakha, and the moon is in the head of
Krttika (these positions being contemporary with the equinoxes), that
equinoctial season is holy (and is styled the Mahavishubha, or the great
equinox) (Wilson. 1980, p. 325).
The vernal equinox was at the principal star of Krttika (Alcyone
in the Pleiades) in about 2222 B.C., and the autumnal equinox was at
the principal star of Visakha (thought to be Iota Librae) in about 1635
B.C. So the statement from Visnu Purana appears to refer to a time
period somewhere in this range of dates. (We use star positions and
not naksatra intervals in these calculations because we do not know



208 8. Notes on Time and Chronology
how naksatra intervals would have been defined before the current
era. The difference between the two dates may be partly due to the
choice of intervals.)
At first glance, this seems strange, since the Visnu Purana’s state¬
ment about the equinoxes in Krttika and Visakha directly follows the
statement putting them in Mesa and Tula. It appears that the person
who wrote this thought that Mesa should begin near Krttika (the
Pleiades), but the constellation of the Ram (Mesa) certainly never
began there.
It may be that Indian astronomers adopted the Greek tropical
zodiac—defined as starting with the vernal equinox in the beginning
of the sign Aries—and they were never concerned with zodiacal
constellations. An editor of the Visnu Purdna may have thought, on
the basis of old texts, that the vernal equinox was in Krttika, and he
naturally assumed that Aries starts there.
Later on, around A.D. 500, the authors of Jyotisa Sdstras brought
things up to date and fixed Mesa (Aries) to the star Revatl (Zeta Pis
cium) in Pisces. This created the modern Indian sidereal zodiac, which
is slightly skewed relative to the constellations, due to the precession
between the second century B.C. and the fifth century A.D.
We note that some authors cast doubt on dates derived from texts
that place an equinox or solstice near a particular constellation. They
say that, gross errors could have been made in solstice or equinox
measurements, and such errors invalidate precessional dates. For
example, David Pingree pushed forward the precessional date of the
Jyotisavedanga by several centuries on the plea that there easily could
have been an error of 10 days in determining the winter solstice
(Pingree, 1973, p. 10). In another context, Willy Hartner said that
“without instruments (gnomon), the determination of the solstices
will needs be affected with an uncertainty of ± eight days or more”
(Hartner, 1965, p. 13).
In view of the statements found in the Visnu Purdna, let us
consider the effect of such errors in determining an equinox. An error
of ±10 days results in an error of about ±720 years in precessional
dating. If we reduce the date when Visakha was at the vernal equinox
by 720 years (assuming that the error is negative), we get 915 B.C.
Likewise, the date when the Pleiades fell on the vernal equinox is
reduced to 1502 B.C. So even if a gross, 10-day error fell consistently



8.2 Precession and the Dating of Texts 209
in the right direction to make things look too old, the Visnu Purana’s
statement about the Mahavishubha is still of considerable antiquity.
Precessional dating is crude due to the possibility of various errors, but
it may still give us a “ball park” figure. We should consider, of course,
that errors may also fall in such a way as to make things look too
young.
8.2.1 Dating by the Sisumara Constellation
The Sisumara constellation is described in verses 5.23.4, 5.23.5,
and 5.23.6-7 of the Bhdgavatam. This constellation includes all of the
twenty-eight naksatras, as well as additional stars to the north of the
ecliptic. It is sometimes considered an incarnation of Krsna, Vasudeva,
and it is meditated upon by yogis.
The Sisumara constellation includes the stars listed in Table 8.1.
These star assignments produce a somewhat irregular figure of an

animal, typical of star constellations. This figure is shown in Figure 8.2
for A.D. 1000. Its head is pointing down, towards the winter solstice.
In the figure, the positive x-axis marks the vernal equinox, and the
negative x-axis marks the autumnal equinox. The positive y-axis
marks the summer solstice, and the negative y-axis marks the winter
solstice. Due to precession of the equinoxes, the Sisumara figure
rotates clockwise or counterclockwise when the date is changed.
The straight, dark gray lines connect pairs of naksatras corre¬
sponding to the bodily parts listed above under 5.23.6. They include
a line connecting Magha to Anuradha. In Figure 8.2, dating to A.D.
1000, this is the nearly vertical straight line on the left hand side.
Magha is the naksatra at the top of this line, and Anuradha is at the
bottom. The southern course of the sun (daksinayana) goes down the
left-hand side of the diagram from summer solstice to autumnal
equinox to winter solstice. It is appropriate for the Magha/Anuradha
line to fall in this interval, since according to 5.23.6, the stars from
Magha to Anuradha mark the southern course.
Figure 8.3 shows the Sisumara in 3000 B.C., and the situations for
intermediate dates are shown in the CD. For dates back to 1000 B.C.,
the Magha/Anuradha line reasonably represents daksinayana. But in

Figure 8.3 The Sisumara constellation is marked by dark gray lines. In 3000 B.C.
it is not aligned with the solstices and its sides do not correspond to the northward
and southward paths of the sun.
3000 B.C., it so greatly tilted that this assignment is no longer reasonable.
The same thing can be said of the line from Purvabhadra to Mrga
sirsa on the right-hand side. These stars are said in 5.23.6 to represent
udagayana, but they cease to do so if we go back as far as 3000 B.C.
In general, the Sisumara is constructed with an axis of symmetry that
should align with the axis from the winter solstice to the summer
solstice. Between 1000 B.C. and A.D. 1000, it lines up with this axis
reasonably well. But if we go back to 3000 B.C., it no longer does so.
Therefore, the Bhagavatam’s account of the Sisumara constella¬
tion supports a precessional date in the range of 1000 B.C. to A.D.
1000. This is contrary to the traditional date of about 3100 B.C. for the
Bhdgavatam, but it may represent a relatively recent astronomical
update to the old text (see Section 8.3, below). Unlike the statement
putting the equinoxes in Mesa and Tula, this update seems to involve
strictly Indian material. However, it may have taken place at about
the same time.
In his commentary on 5.23.5, Srldhara Swami says that daksina
dyandni refers to the fourteen naksatras, Pusya through Uttarasadha,
on the left side of the Sisumara. This statement gives us a precessional

date range from 790 B.C. to A.D. 1111, since this is the period when
these stars lie in the daksinayana interval.
8.3 THE MYSTERIOUS EPOCH OF 3102 B.C.
The traditional date in India for the beginning of Kali-yuga is
February 18, 3102 B.C., as measured by the Gregorian calendar.
According to the Puranas, Lord Krsna departed from the earth at this
time. Thus it is the closing date for the main events of the Mahabharata,
in which Krsna was a major participant.
According to Indologists, 3102 B.C. is far too early for the events of
the Mahabharata, which portray an Iron Age civilization in the Ganges
basin of India. Some archaeologists place the advent of the Indian Iron
Age in about 1000-700 B.C. (Agrawal, 1974, p. 147), and others push it
back to the second half of the second millenium B.C. or somewhat earlier
(Shaffer, 1984). So how did people arrive at 3102 B.C. in the first place?
There is an interesting story behind this, which we present in this section.
We begin with the astronomical tables produced for Alfonso X of
Castile, which list the date of Noah’s Flood as February 17, 3102 B.C.
Similar Flood dates were produced by many medieval and renaissance
Christian chronologists, but this one turns out to be exactly one day
earlier than the traditional Indian date for the beginning of Kali-yuga
(North, 1977, p. 317). This date was widely reproduced in medieval
Western astronomical works. But it belongs to the yuga system of
India, and in that system Kali-yuga does not begin with a flood. So
how did it find its way into European literature?
It turns out that this date can be traced back to the Book of
Thousands written by Abu Ma’shar al-Balkhi in the ninth century.
Abu Ma’shar taught that planetary motions repeat with a period of
360,000 years and that a deluge occurs every 180,000 years. According
to his calculations, the last deluge occurred on February 17,3102 B.C.,
and it was marked by a conjunction of all the planets in the beginning
of Aries, the first sign of the zodiac (van der Waerden, 1987, p. 539).
This combines a typical date for what looks like the Biblical Flood
with huge periods not at all in line with Biblical thinking. This is
puzzling, and we still have to explain the connection with the floodless
Kali-yuga of India.
The mathematician B. L. van der Waerden offered a speculative



8.3 The Mysterious Epoch of 3102 B.C. 213
reconstruction, in which Hellenistic astronomers living somewhere in
the Near East developed methods for theoretically computing plan¬
etary conjunctions by about 200 B.C. (van der Waerden, 1987). These
astronomers were inspired by the idea of a deluge that would occur
when all of the planets lined up at the beginning of the zodiac. They
may have based their ideas directly on Babylonian traditions of the
deluge, bypassing the Bible. Thus the Babylonian priest Berossus in
about 300 B.C. is said to have connected the deluge with a conjunction
of all the planets in Capricorn, and the Hellenistic astronomers may
have followed this tradition.
According to van der Waerden, these astronomers worked back¬
wards in time using conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn in an effort to
calculate the time of the most recent mean alignment of planets. The
result, using their data, was February 17, 3102 B.C.
Later on, astronomers in this school developed “eternal tables,”
based on the assumption that all planets return to their starting points
in a great year of 360,000 years. Their work filtered into Persia and
then India, where it was taken up by the astronomer Aryabhata in the
fifth century. Aryabhata multiplied the length of the great year by 12,
yielding a period of 4,320,000 years. He also replaced the deluge with
the beginning of Kali-yuga. Subsequently, Aryabhata’s calculations
were used in the revised Persian Tables of the Shah, ordered in A.D.
556 by King Khosro Anoshirvan. Abu Ma’shar’s work made use of the
Tables of the Shah.
8.3.1 Conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn
Let us examine how a conjunction of the planets can be calculated
using conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn. First of all, since the period
of Jupiter is about twelve years and the period of Saturn about thirty,
Jupiter slowly catches up with Saturn and overtakes it about once
every twenty years. This means that if you are looking for a conjunc¬
tion of all the planets, it is convenient to go backwards in time by the
twenty-year periods of Jupiter-Saturn conjunctions and search for
additional planetary alignments.
Islamic astronomers in the ninth to the twelfth centuries were doing
this kind of calculation in an effort to date the deluge (van der Waerden,
1980, p. 122). They looked at mean motions of Jupiter and Saturn, in



214 8. Notes on Time and Chronology
which the planets are assumed to move at a steady, average pace
(disregarding retrograde motion). They called a twenty-year conjunc¬
tion of Jupiter and Saturn a small conjunction. Three successive small
conjugations formed a near-equilateral triangle called a trigon, as
shown in Figure 8.4.
The system starts in the beginning of Aries. The first trigon falls
in the signs Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius, called the fire triplicity. Each
successive trigon shifts forward slightly, but the first four all fall in this
triplicity. In aggregate, they are called a middle conjunction (de
Santillana, 1969, p. 400).
The next four trigons fall in the earth triplicity, consisting of
Taurus, Capricorn, and Virgo. Next comes the air triplicity of Gemini,
Aquarius, and Libra, followed by the water triplicity of Cancer, Pisces,
and Scorpio. Four middle conjunctions carry one through all the signs
of the zodiac and are called a big conjunction. However, a big
conjunction leaves one about four signs ahead of one’s starting point
(assumed here to be the beginning of Aries). To return to the starting
point, three big conjunctions are required, and this is called a mighty
conjunction.

time passes, the

8.3 The Mysterious Epoch of 3102 B.C. 215
8.3.2 Computing the Deluge
Van der Waerden proposed that Hellenistic astronomers com¬
puted the deluge date by using this system of Jupiter-Saturn conjunc¬
tions (see Appendix 17).
To find out about conjunctions near 3102 B.C., it is necessary to
work backwards. To illustrate this process, suppose that some Helle¬
nistic astronomer tried to do this on January 1,1 A.D. He would have
known the mean positions of Jupiter and Saturn at this time. From
this, he could easily have computed the date for the most recent small
conjunction. To get back from then to 3102 B.C., it is necessary to
subtract about 156 small conjunctions (of about twenty years apiece).
This procedure inevitably introduces errors. The length of a small
conjunction depends on the numbers used for the motion of Jupiter
and Saturn. If we use Abu Ma’shar’s numbers, a small conjunction
takes 19.8478 years. If we use modern numbers, it takes 19.8585 years.
The difference is small, but it adds up over thirty-one centuries to
about 1.67 years. So we conclude that if our astronomer hit the date
of February 17, 3102 B.C., he did so by chance. Ancient astronomers
made mistakes in their measurements, and this is likely to have pro¬
duced errors of a year or so in their deluge calculations.
8.3.3 Modern Calculations
So why couldn’t the date be a product of chance? As van der
Waerden points out, “According to modern calculation, no conjunc¬
tion took place in 3102 B.C.” (van der Waerden, 1980, p. 119). This is
what we would expect, given the random errors affecting astronomical
back-calculations in ancient times. But it turns out that a near con¬
junction of all the planets did take place precisely on the Kali-yuga
date of February 18, 3102 B.C.
To evaluate such conjunctions, we used an up-to-date ephemeris
program written by S. L. Moshier, based on algorithms from the
Astronomical Almanac. With this program, we examined the posi¬
tions of the planets for every day from January 1,4000 B.C. to January 1,
2000 A.D.
In that entire period of time, there are no alignments of planets
that come even close to being exact. But there are many approximate



216 8. Notes on Time and Chronology
alignments, and one of the closest in this entire period occurs exactly
on the Kali-yuga starting date.
This alignment involves thirteen astronomical longitudes, and it
is presented in the table below. The astronomical objects in the
alignment are listed in the second column. The numbers in the third
column are the ecliptic longitudes of the objects in degrees for the
Julian day 588465.5, corresponding to February 18, 3102 B.C. These
longitudes average out to 306.42 degrees1. The numbers in the fourth
column are the differences between the individual longitudes and the
average longitude. Although there is considerable spread in these
differences, this spread is nearly at a minimum for the entire 6,000 year
period from 4000 B.C. to the year 2000.
This table requires some explanation. First of all, we should
consider what is meant by a Julian day. In astronomy, time is measured

1 When averaging angles, there is the problem that, to give one example, the average
of 1° and 359° is 180°, even though we want 0°. To avoid this, we average over vectors
pointing to the desired angles in the x,y plane. This method gives us the right
averages for general sets of longitudes distributed around the circle.



8.3 The Mysterious Epoch of 3102 B.C. 217
from the epoch of January 1 of the year 4713 B.C.—a date chosen for
technical reasons by Joseph Scaliger of Leyden in 1583 (Neugebauer,
1975, p. 1061). The “Julian day” is the number of days from noon of
this date, as measured at the prime meridian at Greenwich. This is
converted into day/month/year using the Gregorian calendar. A
Julian day ending in .5 corresponds to midnight at Greenwich, since
.5 days from noon is midnight. Thus our table is for midnight, the
beginning of February 18, at Greenwich.
In Indian astronomy, a similar system was used. Time was expressed
by the ahargana, or “collection of days,” counted from a particular
epoch. Typically, this epoch was midnight on the beginning of the first
day of Kali-yuga, as measured on the meridian through Ujjain. This
city is about 76° east of Greenwich, a difference of about five hours.
In Ujjain our date is therefore at about five in the morning of the 18th.
Ancient astronomers referred to seven “planets,” consisting of the
sun, the moon, and Mercury through Saturn. The outer planets, Uranus,
Neptune, and Pluto, were discovered only recently, as far as we can tell
from existing records. Nonetheless, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto are
also part of the Kali-yuga alignment. Ceres, the largest asteroid, was
discovered in the 19th century, and it is also part of the alignment.
As far as orbital physics is concerned, the fact that the sun, moon,
and five planets are partially aligned does not imply that four other
planets should also be aligned with these seven. The four additional
planets—Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, and Ceres—could be anywhere in
Figure 8.5 The sun, moon, and planets are shown for midnight of February 18,
3102 B.C., according to modern ephemeris calculations (done by the program called
SkyGlobe). Note that even Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto are part of the alignment,
which covers about 90° of the sky with these planets included.



218 8. Notes on Time and Chronology
the 360° of the circle. But on the Kali-yuga date, they were clustered
within an arc of 90° along with the seven traditional planets.
In Indian astronomy, the ascending and descending nodes of the
moon are treated as planets, called Rahu and Ketu. These nodes mark
the points on the celestial sphere where the plane of the ecliptic inter¬
sects the plane of the moon’s orbit, and they are connected with solar
and lunar eclipses. In Western traditions, they are known as the head
and tail of the dragon. According to Indian astronomy, Ketu is part
of the Kali-yuga alignment, and we see from the table that this is
correct. Rahu, of course, is always 180° from Ketu, and it is situated
opposite to the alignment.
It is often said that the Kali-yuga alignment is in the beginning of
Aries, the first sign of the sidereal zodiac. Actually, Venus, Jupiter, and
Ketu lie in Aries, if this is defined according to medieval Jyotisa Sastras
as beginning 10 minutes of arc after the star Zeta Piscium. The sun,
moon, Mercury, Mars, and Saturn lie in Pisces, the sign before Aries.
We should note that traditional Indian astronomers used a
sidereal zodiac, which is fixed relative to the stars. In contrast, Western
astronomy has inherited the tropical zodiac from its Hellenistic
forbears. In the tropical zodiac, Aries begins with the vernal equinox,
by definition, and it shifts with the precession of the equinoxes. In this
zodiac, the Kali-yuga alignment falls in Aquarius and Capricorn, with
the midpoint near the beginning of Aquarius.
However, it may be misleading to look at the Kali-yuga alignment
from the point of view of the Western zodiac. Interesting insights
emerge if we instead consider the Indian naksatra system.
Consider Citra, the bright star known in the West as Spica (Alpha
Virginis). It is one of the twenty-eight naksatras or “lunar mansions” that
mark the ecliptic in Indian astronomy. It is significant that the lunar
months of the Indian calendar are named after naksatras. The first month
of the spring season is traditionally Caitra, which is named after Citra.
Lunar months are determined by the phases of the moon, and
they can be either amanta, meaning from new moon to new moon, or
purnimanta, meaning from full moon to full moon. Ideally, a lunar
month was named after the naksatra in which the full moon appeared
during that month. As with the zodiac, the naksatra constellations
correspond to fixed subdivisions of the ecliptic, and the full moon is
“in” a naksatra if its longitude lies in the appropriate subdivision. In



8.3 The Mysterious Epoch of 3102 B.C. 219
practice, the moon might become full in one of the naksatras on either
side of the one designated by the month’s name.
At the time of the Kali-yuga conjunction, the moon was new and
it marked the beginning of the amanta lunar month of Caitra. Accord¬
ing to the SkyGlobe astronomy program, the new moon occurred on
about 9:16 p.m., New Delhi time, on February 17, 3102 B.C.—about
three hours before midnight of the 18th. At midnight in the beginning
of March 5, the moon was full in close conjunction with the star Citra.
Thus the Kali-yuga conjunction occurred on the first day of the
beginning of Spring, according to the ancient Indian calendar.
8.3.4 High-Precision Conjunctions
To evaluate how close the Kali-yuga alignment is, we need a single
number to represent the spreading out of the planets and other objects
along the ecliptic. For any given date, we use Moshier’s ephemeris
program to calculate the longitudes of the thirteen astronomical
objects. We then compute the root-mean-square difference between
the thirteen longitudes and their average. This tells us how far the
individual longitudes spread out around their average. For the Kali
yuga alignment, this spread factor comes to 22.85°.
We evaluated the spread factor for every day from 4000 B.C. to
A.D. 2000 and looked for days when it dipped down to a minimum
(meaning that it was higher the day before and the day after). These
can be called minimal alignments. In this entire 6,000-year period,
there were only three minimal alignments in which the spread of the
thirteen objects was no greater than it was on February 18, 3102 B.C.
These appear in Table 8.3.
What we see is that the alignment of 3102 B.C. is not exact, but it
is one of the three closest alignments in the last 6,000 years.
We should emphasize that although these numbers reflect up-to
date astronomical knowledge, they are also subject to error. We do
not know by observation what the planets were doing thousands of
years ago, and no two modern ephemeris programs will give exactly
the same answers. However, given uniformitarian assumptions, these
calculations are probably not very far off.
If the date of February 18,3102 B.C. was obtained by astronomical
calculation between 2,200 and 1,500 years ago, then it would have



220 8. Notes on Time and Chronology
TABLE 8.3

Feb. 18, 3102 B.C. 588465.5 22.85

been affected by random errors in the astronomical parameters used
by astronomers in that period. These errors certainly should be greater
than the corresponding modern ones. Yet the date agrees to the day
with one of the best astronomical alignments in a 6,000 year period,
as determined by modern calculations. This is quite improbable.
One might anticipate that more alignments will show up if we
limit ourselves to a smaller set of objects. In fact, if we use the sun, the
moon, and the five planets Mercury through Saturn, we find 324
minimal alignments in the 6,000 year period with a spread no greater
than the spread of 13.56° that occurs on the Kali-yuga date. If we add
Ketu to the list of objects, the number of minimal alignments no worse
than the Kali-yuga alignment goes down to fifty-two. If we add Citra
plus 180°, it goes down to ten. In each of these cases, the Kali-yuga
alignment is minimal in the sense that the spread dips down to a
minimum on February 18, 3102 B.C.
The uniqueness of the Kali-yuga alignment depends on the
contribution of all of the astronomical objects that make it up. In
particular, if we look at the positions of Jupiter and Saturn in the
alignment, we see that they are separated by nearly 41°. They do not
line up at all well, and therefore the Kali-yuga alignment would not
be found by someone looking at Jupiter-Saturn conjunctions with
accurate data.
But it so happens that Islamic astronomers such as Abu Ma’shar
had inaccurate parameters for Jupiter and Saturn that just happened
to give a conjunction of these planets at the Kali-yuga date. How did
this happen? The most plausible answer is that they followed
Aryabhata, who assumed an exact conjunction of planets on this date.



8.3 The Mysterious Epoch of 3102 B.C. 221
Let us examine this matter more closely. First of all, we can not
trace these parameters back to Claudius Ptolemy. According to his
data, the mean positions of Jupiter and Saturn on that date were
about 325° and 291°. If Ptolemy had searched for Jupiter-Saturn
conjunctions, he would have missed the Kali-yuga date.
On this date, the best alignment of the thirteen objects occurred
at about 4:48 a.m. on the 18th, Greenwich time, or about 9:52 a.m. in
Ujjain. It would have been 6:48 a.m. in Alexandria. Aryabhata’s
midnight system put the Kali-yuga date at midnight in the beginning
of February 18, and his sunrise system put it roughly at sunrise at 6:00
a.m. on that day. In contrast, Abu Ma’shar and the Tables of the Shah
put the Flood date on midnight of February 17, the day before.
Van der Waerden explains this by pointing out that Abu Ma’shar
added V3600 of a day to the year used in Aryabhata’s midnight system
(van der Waerden, 1987, p. 537). As we mentioned in Appendix 16,
Aryabhata commented that 3,600 years of Kali-yuga had elapsed on
his twenty-third birthday. Apparently, Abu Ma’shar and the author
of the Persian tables reckoned from Aryabhata’s twenty-third birth¬
day, using their slightly longer year. By doing this, they missed the
optimal alignment by one day.
Van der Waerden agrees that Abu Ma’shar and the Tables of the
Shah depend on the work of Aryabhata (van der Waerden, 1987, p. 538).
Aryabhata assumed an exact mean conjunction of all seven planets on
the Kali-yuga date, and nearly all medieval Indian astronomers did
the same. So it is no coincidence that calculations based on Indian
astronomy yield a Jupiter-Saturn conjunction at that date. But the
question remains: How was the date selected in the first place?
8.3.5 Alternative Explanations
At present, this remains a mystery. The possible explanations are
as follows:
1. Hellenistic astronomers, using erroneous data based on speculation
and poor, naked-eye observations, stumbled on the date of the
Kali-yuga conjunction by chance. We estimated above that the
error in calculating a mean Jupiter/Saturn conjunction in about
3102 B.C. comes to about 1.67 years. (According to SkyGlobe, there



222 8. Notes on Time and Chronology
was an actual Jupiter/Saturn conjunction on about Jan. 9,3104 B.C.)
So the chance hypothesis says that an error of about 2 years landed
our Hellenistic astronomers on the precise day of an unusual
planetary conjunction. A lucky hit!
2. The conjunction of February 18, 3102 B.C. was observed, and the
date was preserved in historical records up to the time of Arya¬
bhata (about A.D. 500). At some point in this period, people forgot
that an unusual partial alignment had occurred, and they imagined
an exact alignment on this date.
For records to be effectively maintained, a well-organized
civilization must have existed over this entire span of time. How¬
ever, well before Aryabhata’s time, surviving records may have
become fragmentary and poorly understood. As knowledge de¬
clined, the growing vacuum was filled by newer developments
starting nearly from scratch, but with inspiration from stories of the
past. These new developments included the astronomy of the
Babylonians and the Hellenistic Greeks.
In India, Aryabhata combined some of these new materials
with surviving ancient fragments and started a new school of
thought. By successfully establishing a new standard, he contrib¬
uted to the neglect of older material, which gradually disappeared
completely. In the West, the rise of Babylonian and Greek as¬
tronomy had a similar effect.
This loss of earlier writings is an accepted social phenomenon.
For example, Neugebauer pointed out that when new authoritative
works on a subject are produced, people may cease to pay attention
to older works, which then fall into oblivion. In particular, this
process erased much of the history of Greek mathematics and
astronomy. He remarked that “The dominating influence of Euclid’s
Elements succeeded in destroying almost all references to pre
Euclidian writings, and essentially the same effect was produced by
Ptolemy’s works” (Neugebauer, 1945, p. 16).
3. Another explanation of the Kali-yuga conjunction is that it was
found by calculations using advanced astronomical knowledge and
mathematical techniques. This hypothesis also implies the exist¬
ence of an advanced civilization that greatly declined before the
advent of the well-known civilizations of classical antiquity.
4. A fourth hypothesis is that people were informed of the significance



8.4 The Yuga System 223
of the conjunction of 3102 B.C. through communication from
higher beings. Although this is not acceptable from a conventional
scientific perspective, it would have seemed perfectly reasonable in
ancient times. In India, for example, the Puranas state that before
the advent of Kali-yuga, great saints and sages openly served as
intermediaries between human society and higher civilizations
within the universe. Other ancient societies, such as the Sumerians,
also maintained that their ancestors had learned extensively from
higher beings descending from the heavens.
Apart from the theory of pure chance, all of the possible expla¬
nations of the Kali-yuga date require the existence of an ancient civil¬
ization that was highly advanced. The question remains: Where was
this advanced civilization, and when did it exist? At present, this
remains a mystery. We note, however, that the evidence for sophisti¬
cated astronomical knowledge in the Bhagavatam also implies the exist¬
ence of advanced scientific knowledge at some time before the modern
scientific period. (See Sections 4.4 and 4.5.) For evidence of remnants
of advanced astronomy in the Surya-siddhanta, see Appendix 10.
8.4 THE YUGA SYSTEM
The chronology of the Puranas consists of a series of time divisions
that can collectively be called the yuga system. This system is ex¬
pounded in the Puranas, in the principal Jyotisa Sastras, and in many
medieval Sanskrit texts. The Manu-samhitd and the Mahahharata also
define this system, and the four original Vedas may allude to it indirectly.
This chronological system is based on four time periods called
yugas. The Manu~samhita describes the lengths of the yugas in years
as listed in Table 8.4 (Dikshit, 1969a, pp. 103-4).
Each yuga begins and ends with intermediate periods, called the
sandhya and sandhydmsa, which are one-tenth as long as the main
body of the yuga. The total of the four yugas is called a divine yuga
(divya-yuga), and it comes to 12,000 years. This period is also called
a mahayuga, a catur-yuga, or simply a yuga in various texts. A day of
Brahma, also known as a kalpa, is defined to be 1,000 divine yugas, or
12,000,000 years. It is also mentioned that a Patriarchate, or man vantara,
consists of seventy-one divya-yugas.



224 8. Notes on Time and Chronology

Yugas in Divine Years

Krta-yuga 4,800 400 4,000 400

Dvapara-yuga 2,400 200 2,000 200
Kali-yuga 1,200 100 1,000 100
The yuga periods are arranged like a set of bowling pins according
to the pattern 4+3+2+1 = 10. Each of these numbers is then multiplied
by the factors, 100 + 1,000 + 100 = 1,200, which are suggestive of dawn,
daytime, and evening.
In Jyotisa Sastras such as the Surya-siddhanta, the yugas are
explicitly multiplied by 360 to yield the following lengths:
TABLE 8.5
The Yuga System in Human Years
Division Length (years)
Krta-yuga 1,728,000
Treta-yuga 1,296,000
Dvapara-yuga 864,000
Kali-yuga 432,000
divya-yuga 4,320,000
manvantara 306,720,000
day of Brahma 4,320,000,000
The multiplication is done by replacing years in the Manu-sam
hita’s yuga definitions by divine years of 360 human years.
The Bhagavata Purana follows the pattern of the Manu-samhita
by specifying a divya-yuga of 12,000 divine years, with Krta-yuga and
so on as multiples of 1,200 by 4:3:2:1 (Bhagavatam 3.11.18-19). A
manvantara period of a little more than 71 divya-yugas is also defined,



8.4 The Yuga System 225
as well as a kalpa, or day of Brahma, of 1,000 divya-yugas (Bhagavatam
3.11.24).
There is no explicit reference to the span of 4,320,000 years in the
Bhagavatam. But this period is implied by the use of the words divya
varsa (divine year) in verse 3.11.18. Although the divine year is not
defined in the text, verse 5.20.30 says that a day and night of the
demigods is one human year. This suggests that a year of the demigods
should be 360 years, since the year is assigned 360 days. In the Vayu
Purdna, this is spelled out by the statement that 360,000 human years
equals 1,000 divine years (Tagare, 1987, p. 398).
It is noteworthy that the Bhagavatam gives 360 days as the length
of one year and it never explicitly mentions a year of 36514 days. This
gives us a consistent situation in which a divine day is 360 human days
and a divine year is 360 human years. However, Jyotisa Sastras such as
the Surya-siddhanta use a solar year of 36514+ days when speaking of
the mahayuga of 4,320,000 years. We show below in Section 8.5 that
there are good astronomical reasons for using a nominal year of 360
days and that this period was never intended as a literal solar year. But
the question remains of whether the Bhagavatam and other Puranas
intended the mahayuga to be composed of 360-day years or of realistic
solar years of 36514+ days.
There is some controversy regarding the history of the yuga sys¬
tem. The traditional view in India is that the yugas are real and have
therefore been going on for millions of years. The view of modern
historians is that the yugas are mere ideas that developed historically
through a series of stages. In particular, the suggestion is often made
that the four yugas once added up to 12,000 human years and were
later expanded to 12,000 divine years of 360 years apiece. We discuss
these historical issues below in Section 8.4.1.
In his famous Cosmos series, the astronomer Carl Sagan re¬
marked that “The Hindu religion is the only one of the world’s great
faiths dedicated to the idea that the Cosmos itself undergoes an
immense, indeed an infinite, number of deaths and rebirths. It is the
only religion in which the time scales correspond, no doubt by
accident, to those of modern scientific cosmology” (Sagan, 1980,
p. 258). Sagan is referring to the fact that each of the cycles in the yuga
system ends with some form of pralaya or annihilation. Thus the day
of Brahma ends with the destruction of the three worlds, Bhur,



226 8. Notes on Time and Chronology
Bhuvar, and Svar, followed by a night of Brahma of equal duration.
This is followed by a new creation in the next day of Brahma.
The day of Brahma lasts 4,320,000,000 years, and this roughly
matches the modern scientific estimate of 4.5 billion years for the age
of the earth. The manvantaras of about 307 million years remind us,
even more roughly, of geological periods spanning hundreds of
millions of years. Somehow or other, the Puranic time scales make
sense from the standpoint of modern geology and cosmology. In
contrast, Biblical chronology dates the creation of the world to a few
thousand years ago—on October 23, 4004 B.C. according to the
famous calculations of Archbishop James Ussher (North, 1977, p. 307).
The yugas reflect vast cosmic cycles, but they also express a cyclic
understanding of human history. According to this concept, life on
earth revolves through a sequence of four ages, starting with Krta
yuga. This period is also called Satya-yuga, or the age of truth, and it
corresponds to the golden age of Greek mythology. In this period, life
is idyllic and human beings live tranquilly in a state of pure goodness.
The succeeding three yugas, corresponding to the ages of silver,
bronze, and iron, are marked by increasing degradation in human
society. The final age of Kali is a period of darkness and quarrel. But
after a great debacle, goodness is restored, and the cycle begins again
with Krta-yuga.
From the standpoint of modern historical dating, a divya-yuga of
12,000 ordinary years fits human history much better than a divya
yuga of 12,000 divine years. Could it be that divine and human cycles
of 12,000 years are both intended by the yuga system—with one
representing events on a cosmic scale and the other mirroring the petty
pace of human affairs? There is no explicit indication of this in the
Puranas or the Mahabharata. However, the evidence suggesting a
historical transition from human to divine yugas might also be taken
to imply an acceptance of both scales of time.
In Section 5.2, we pointed out that key features of Puranic
cosmology (such as Mount Meru) have parallels in traditions from
around the world. The same is true of the idea of a temporal cycle
characterized by advancing corruption and punctuated by annihila¬
tion. Thus the Greeks believed that each set of four ages ended in a
catastrophe. Norse mythology taught that the destruction of the gods,
called ragnarok, was followed by a fresh cycle of creation . The Chinese



8.4 The Yuga System 227
called the interval between world destructions a “great year,” and the
Hopi spoke of four worlds, with three ended by destruction (Heinberg,
1989, pp. 107-8). Likewise, the Sioux Indians have a close parallel to
the Hindu bull of Dharma that loses one leg during each of the four
successive yugas (see Appendix 18).
The Puranic cycle of the yugas is associated with Bharata-varsa.
Thus the Bhdgavatam verse 5.17.12 states that conditions like those of
Treta-yuga prevail in the eight varsas of Jambudvlpa other than
Bharata-varsa, and the Vayu Purana assigns the four yugas to Bharata
varsa alone (Tagare, 1987, p. 398). This is consistent with the interpre¬
tation of Bharata-varsa as the whole earth and the other eight varsas
of Jambudvlpa as heavenly regions (see Section 6.1).
The Surya-siddhanta gives some details on the yuga system that
are widely accepted in Hinduism but do not appear in the Bhdgavatam.
This astronomical text divides the day of Brahma into fourteen man¬
vantara periods of seventy-one divya-yugas apiece (Burgess, 1860,
p. 11). Each of these is followed by a sandhya, or twilight period, which
lasts one Krta-yuga. There is also a beginning sandhya before the first
manvantara. If we combine a manvantara with its sandhya, we get 71.4
divya-yugas, since a Krta-yuga is 0.4 divya-yugas. This may be what
verse 3.11.24 of the Bhdgavatam means when it says that a manvantara
is a little more than seventy-one divya-yugas. The breakdown be¬
tween manvantaras and sandhyds is as follows:
1,000 = 15 x .4 + 14 x 71
Having defined the manvantara and its sandhya, the Surya
siddhanta goes on to fix its own date. In this day of Brahma, six
manvantaras are said to have elapsed with their respective twilights,
and twenty-seven divya-yugas have elapsed in the seventh manvantara,
called Vaivasvata (Burgess, 1860, pp. 12-13). The Surya-siddhanta
dates itself to the beginning of Treta-yuga by stating that Krta-yuga
has elapsed in the twenty-eighth divya-yuga. According to traditional
usage in India, the Treta and Dvapara-yugas have passed, and we are
in about the 5,000th year of Kali-yuga.
This chronology is generally accepted by followers of the Bhd¬
gavatam in India. In the Golokera Gamana section of the Brahma
vaivarta Parana, it is connected with a timetable which indicates that
for the first 5,000 years of Kali-yuga, people will be purified from sins



228 8. Notes on Time and Chronology
by bathing in the Ganges. There is also mention of a 10,000-year period
in which people will be purified by contact with the Lord’s devotees.
By traditional reckoning, the 5000th year of Kali-yuga falls in 1899.
This prophecy is presented in a dialogue between the goddess
Ganga and Lord Krsna, who was about to depart from this world.
Here we present a translation by Robert Woodfield:
The Ganges said: “O Lord, best of those who are pleasing, You are
going to Goloka, that excellent planet of cows. What will be my destiny
here in the age of Kali?” (49)
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: “Remain on this earth for
five thousand years of Kali. The sinful people will give you their sins by
bathing (in you). (50)
“Just as sins are (destroyed) by bathing (in you) O Ganga, by
touching or even seeing one who is dedicated to chanting My mantra, sins
are immediately reduced to ashes. (51)
“Wherever the ancient names of the Lord are, going there with care
you will hear them along with them (other female river goddesses
mentioned earlier). . .. (52)
“My devotees shall be on the earth for ten thousand years of Kali. My
devotees being so, they will constitute one caste. (59)
“When the earth is no longer inhabited by My devotees, the earth will
be in the grip of the age of Kali.” (60)
8.4.1 Age of the Yuga System
Some Indologists maintain that the system of four yugas was
originally based on a dice game mentioned in Vedic texts and in the
Mahahharata (Gonzalez-Reimann, 1989). In this game, there were
four throws, called krta, tretd, dvapara, and kali. Krta was the best
throw, with a value of 4, and it means “done” in Sanskrit. Treta and
dvapara had values of 3 and 2 (tri and dva in Sanskrit), and kali, with
a value of 1, was the worst throw.
The idea is that this game inspired the cyclic system of yugas
sometime around the fourth century B.C. The yugas were first defined
as multiples by 4:3:2:1 of a Kali-yuga of 1,200 human years. Later they
were expanded by the device of replacing human years by divine years
of 360 human years.
Of course, one could argue that the dice game was inspired by the
yuga system and that it testifies to the existence of this system in the



8.4 The Yuga System 229
Vedic period. Of greater weight is the thesis that the divya-yuga of
12,000 divine years is a recent expansion of an earlier cycle of as many
human years.
In his treatise on Indian astronomy, S. B. Dikshit offered several
counterarguments to this theory. First of all, he pointed out that the
idea of a divine day dates back to the Vedic period (Dikshit, 1969a,
p. 65). This is shown by the following quote from the Taittiriya Sam
hitd of the Vedas:
ekam va etaddevdndmahah yatsamvatsarah (The year is equivalent to
a day of the gods.) (Te. Bra. 3.6.22).
One could infer from this that the divine year was also known in the
Vedic period. Samvatsara generally denotes a nominal year of 360 days,
and a year of the gods should therefore be 360 years, or 360 x 360 days.
Dikshit argued that the 12,000-year divya-yuga of the Manu
samhita must be made of divine years, since otherwise it wouldn’t be
called divine, or divya (Dikshit, 1969a, p. 104). Thus he maintained
that the divya-yuga of 4,320,000 = 360 x 12,000 human years dates
back to the Manu-samhita in the second-century A.D., or earlier.
Dikshit also pointed out that the Nirukta of Yaska assigns 1,000
yugas to the day of Brahma, without defining what is meant by a yuga
(Dikshit, 1969a, p. 102). Thus the day of Brahma was already known
as a series of 1,000 lesser cycles in Yaska’s time—about 500 B.C. Of
course, these might have been cycles of 12,000 ordinary years.
To see if the Mahabharata supports a cycle of 12,000 human years,
we consulted Ganguli’s translation and compared it with the Sanskrit
text of the critical edition (Tokunaga, 1996). The Mahabharata de¬
fines the yugas in the standard way as 1,200 years times 4:3:2:1. How¬
ever, in 3.186.18-21, this is done using the word varsa for year without
any qualifying term meaning “divine.” The same is true of the verses
starting with 12.224.191. Just before the latter verse, it is said that a
human year is a day and night of the gods. It is further stated that their
day is the udagayana and their night is the daksinayana (the northern
and southern courses of the sun). There is, however, no mention of a
divine year. Ganguli glosses years as “years of the deities” in the yuga
definitions, but this appears to be based on traditional understanding
and not on the literal reading of the text (Ganguli, vol. IX, p. 155).



230 8. Notes on Time and Chronology
Either the Mahabhdrata is defining a yuga cycle that sums to
12,000 human years, or it is implicitly following a tradition that
assumes divine years made of days and nights of the gods. The latter
is quite plausible, since the Bhagavatam itself defines the divya-yuga
as 12,000 divine years without ever defining the divine year. More¬
over, like the Mahabhdrata, the Bhagavatam defines a divine day as
the northern and southern courses of the sun (i.e. one year). Thus we
have a pattern in which 12,000-year periods and divine days are
mentioned, but divine years of 360 human years are assumed without
mention.
Gonzalez-Reimann (1988) has pointed out that numbers related
to the yuga system are embedded in Vedic texts, and this is also
discussed in Kak, (1993a) and (1993b). For example the Satapatha
Brahmana states that the Rg Veda contains 432,000 syllables. This is
expressed as 12,000 verse brhatis, each of which has thirty-six syllables,
or 10,800 verse panktis, each composed of forty syllables.
Some of the fire altars described in the Vedas are also built with
10,800 bricks (Gonzalez-Reimann, 1988, p. 108). This suggests that the
groundwork for yuga-cycle calculations was already laid down in the
days of the Satapatha Brahmana and the Vedic fire sacrifices. The
Satapatha Brahmana is dated by some scholars to 1000-800 B.C.
(Seidenberg, 1978, 320).
The number 10,800 is easily arrived at, using numbers that were
familiar in Vedic times. For example 10,800 is the number of muhurtas
(30ths of a day) in a year of 360 days. It also appears in familiar Western
calculations. For example, it is the number of minutes in half a circle
(180° x 60 minutes/degree).
The numbers used in the yuga system are similar in many ways to
numbers used in modern astronomy. The factor of 360 is reminiscent
of the number of degrees in a circle. The length of Treta-yuga is 360
x 3,600, which equals the number of arcseconds in a circle. The length
of Dvapara-yuga is 240 x 3,600, and this comes to ten times the
number of seconds in a 24-hour day.
There are also many examples of the numbers 10,800 and 432,000
from Europe and the Near East, and some of these refer specifically
to long periods of time. According to Censorinus, 10,800 years was
given by Heraclitus as the duration of the Aion. In the Icelandic Edda,
Valhalla was said to have 540 doors and 800 warriors would issue from



8.4 The Yuga System 231
each of these doors to fight with the Wolf. The total number of
warriors comes to 432,000 (de Santillana, 1969, p. 162). If people in
widely separated places were not independently coming up with these
numbers, then time must be allowed for them to widely spread out
from some original source.
One possible source is Babylon. According to the ninth-century
writer Georgius Syncellus, in 280 B.C. the Babylonian priest Berossus
gave 120 saroi as the time for the reign of the Babylonian kings before
the flood. Since a saros is 3,600 years, this comes to 432,000 years
(North, 1977, p. 315). Berossus also stated that the time elapsed from
the creation to the universal catastrophe is 2,160,000 years (with
2,148,000 years from creation to Alexander the Great and 12,000 years
from Alexander to the catastrophe). This is half of a divya-yuga, and
it is also ten “great sars” of the Babylonians (Sellers, 1992, pp. 196,200).
It is noteworthy that Berossus expressed 432,000 as 120 saroi of
3,600 years apiece, whereas the Kali-yuga is 1,200 divine years of 360
years apiece. Thus even the arithmetic used in Babylon is similar to
that used in India. For some, this suggests that these calculations were
transmitted into India from Babylon. However, the Satapatha
Brahmana antedates Berossus, and the Indologist Jean Filliozat has
suggested that this transmission could have happened in the inverse
order—from India to Mesopotamia (Gonzalez-Reimann, 1988, p. 104).
This would imply the presence of yugas measured in divine years in
India before the third century B.C.
Although the Bhagavatam does not mention precession of the
equinoxes directly, a number of scholars have seen a connection
between the yuga system and precession. For example, Stella
Kramrisch, in her study of Hindu temple designs, argues that “All the
cyclical numbers in Hindu cosmology are essentially based on the
period of the precession of the equinoxes” (Kramrisch, 1946, p. 36).
Her observation boils down to the fact that a divya-yuga is 2,000 x
2,160 years. The latter period is the time for the vernal equinox to pass
through one sign of the zodiac, and thus it is the length of the
celebrated ages of the signs, such as the Age of Aquarius.
If this is not mere coincidence, it suggests a link between the yuga
system and Western astrological calculations, which assign great
importance to the 2,160-year ages of the zodiacal signs. This link may
extend back to the ancient roots of astrology. Thus the Egyptologist



232 8. Notes on Time and Chronology
Jane Sellers has argued that numbers such as 2,160 and 432 repre¬
sented precession in the ancient Near East long before its rediscovery
by Hipparchus in the second century B.C. (Sellers, 1992).
By the way, in this scheme, the cycle of precession takes 25,920
years, and this is 432 sixty-year cycles of Jupiter. The sixty-year cycle
of Jupiter is discussed below in Section 8.5, and it would have
originally been measured in years of 360 days.
Another number which may be related to the divya-yuga is the
360,000-year world-year of the Persians. This was used by Abu
Ma’shar of Balkh and traced by B. L. van der Waerden to the sixth
century Persian Tables of the Shah and to earlier Persian sources. It
is V12 of a divya-yuga. Van der Waerden argues that the sixth-century
Indian astronomer Aryabhata corrected the Persian theory by “re¬
placing the Persian world-year of 360,000 years by a period twelve
times as large” (van der Waerden, 1987, p. 539).
Aryabhata used a mahayuga of 4,320,000 years, and he differed
from other Indian astronomers by dividing it into four equal yugas
(instead of using the 4:3:2:1 division). He was also the sole Indian
astronomer to teach that day and night are due to the rotation of the
earth on its axis. However, if he thought that the Indian mahayuga
used to be much shorter and that his 4.32 million-year cycle was a new
invention, he didn’t let on. The origin of this period remains a mystery.
8.5 PLANETARY PERIODS AND THE 360-DAY YEAR
Many ancient societies made use of a year of 360 days, and this
may seem grossly inaccurate. However, the Bhdgavatam shows that
certain key astronomical periodicities can be expressed simply in
terms of a year of about 360 days. This may account for the widespread
use of this period. For example, the Bhdgavatam verse 5.22.15 states
that Jupiter completes its orbit in 12 years of 360 days, or 4,320 = 108
x 40 days. Verse 5.22.16 says that Saturn completes its orbit in 30 years
or 10,800 = 108 x 100 days. According to modern data, the correct
periods are 4,332.23 days for Jupiter and 10,800.44 days for Saturn
(Green, 1985, p. 504). The Bhdgavatam approximates these values
within 0.3% and 0.004%, respectively.
These simple expressions of 12 and 30 years work, because the
Bhdgavatam uses a formal year of 360 days, rather than the accurate



8.5 Planetary Periods and the 360-day Year 233
year of 365 and a fraction days. One way to see this is to note that the
modern period of Jupiter is 12 “years’' of 361.02 days, and the modern
period of Saturn is 30 “years” of 360.015 days.
The shortest period in which both Jupiter and Saturn make a
complete orbit is the least common multiple of 12 and 30 years, and
this comes to 60 years. Thus the 60-year cycle of Jupiter, which is
commonly used in India, may have originally been 60 years of 360
days. This comes to 21,600 days per cycle or 1 day per minute of arc,
if we imagine the cycle as a continuous rotation. In the Surya
siddhdnta, this cycle comes to 60.17 360-day years or 59.30 solar years
(Burgess, 1860, p. 39).
The orbital period of the moon also simplifies if it is expressed in
relation to a solar period of 360 days. The Bhagavatam verse 5.22.8
says that in 2.25 days, the moon travels the distance (in longitude)
traveled by the sun in a month. We are dealing with a year of 360 days
and a month of 30 days. One way to look at this is to say that the sun
covers a full circle of 360° in a 12-month year of 360 days, and the moon
covers a full circle in 2.25 x 12 = 27 days. These estimates are not very
accurate.
But there is another way to interpret these figures. The verse could
be taken as saying that the longitude covered by the sun in a 30-day
month is not necessarily 30°, but it is the same as the longitude covered
by the moon in 2.25 days. Using modern data, at a mean rate of
0.985609°/day, the sun covers 29.56827° in a 30-day month. The moon
completes one sidereal orbit (relative to the stars) in 27.32166 days. It
therefore moves at a mean rate of 360/27.32166 = 13.17635° per day,
and in 2.25 days it moves 29.6468°. This is about 0.3% above the sun’s
monthly movement. Thus the moon does travel in about 2.25 days the
distance traveled by the sun in a month.
This interpretation is supported by an old version of the Indian
lunar zodiac. In the lunar zodiac, the ecliptic is divided into twenty
seven or twenty-eight intervals, called naksatras. Like the twelve signs
of the zodiac, each naksatra corresponds both to an interval of the
ecliptic and a constellation of stars. Indian astronomy generally
assumes twenty-seven naksatras, which may be equal or unequal in
length, depending on the system used.
However, one Indian system uses twenty-eight naksatras. Here,
twenty-seven naksatras represent the angle covered by the moon in



234 8. Notes on Time and Chronology
twenty-seven days. This comes to 355.7625°, according to the medi¬
eval Indian astronomer Brahmagupta. A twenty-eighth naksatra
called Abhijit is covered by the remainder of the Moon’s sidereal
period (Dikshit, 1888). Using the modern figure for the sidereal year,
we find that the sun covers Brahmagupta’s twenty-seven naksatras in
about 361 days. Thus in this system, the 360-day year roughly
corresponds to the time for the sun to cross twenty-seven naksatras.
If the moon covers in twenty-seven days the longitude covered by
the sun in 360, we can give the moon a speed of V27 and the sun a speed
of 1/360. This means that the moon overtakes the sun at a speed of

V27 - V360. The ratio between the moon’s speed and its speed of over¬
taking the sun is the same as the ratio between the synodic month (the
time from new moon to new moon) and the sidereal month. If we
work this out, we get 1080/999. Curiously enough, this generates a
repeating decimal, 1.08108108 ...
This estimate differs from the modern ratio by 0.02%. Thus, the
average time required for 100 lunar months from new moon to new
moon is nearly the same as the time for 108 orbits of the moon relative
to the stars, a relationship that could have been important for ancient
people using lunar calendars.
It is noteworthy that the Bhagavatam’s periods for Jupiter and
Saturn, as discussed above, are 108 x 40 and 108 x 100. The number
108 is extremely popular in India. For example, it is the number of
beads in an Indian rosary, orjapa mala. The guru is addressed as having
108 glories, and there are said to be 108 (or 1,008) Upanisads. Perhaps
this popularity stems from apparent astronomical coincidences, such
as the ones involving Jupiter, Saturn, and the moon.
Subash Kak (1993a) has pointed out yet another relationship
involving 108. He notes that this number is roughly the average
distance of the sun from the earth in terms of its own diameter, and
it is also the average distance of the moon from the earth in terms of
the moon’s diameter. The true averages according to modern data
come to 107.6 and 110.6, respectively. It is due to this coincidence in
ratios that the moon has the same apparent size as the sun and can
almost exactly cover the disk of the sun during a solar eclipse.
Thus we have found three naturally defined periods of about 360
to 361 days that are connected with the orbital periods of Jupiter,



8.5 Planetary Periods and the 360-day Year 235
Saturn, the sun, and the moon. Another such period is defined by the
average of the lunar year of twelve lunar months (about 354.367 days)
and the sidereal year (of 365.2564 days). These periods may have made
it convenient to define a formal year of 360 days, and this period may
therefore have never been intended as an actual solar year.
This may shed some light on the curious fact that many nations of
antiquity used a year of 360 days. The Rg Sarhhita used this figure in
a figurative description of the year as a wheel:
Twelve spoke boards, one wheel, three navels. Who understands
these? In these there are 360 Sahkus (rods) put in like pegs which do not
get loosened (Dikshit, 1969a, p. 18).
The Bhdgavatam, as usual, follows ancient standards and says
nearly the same thing:
Your wheel, which has three naves, rotates around the axis of the
imperishable Brahman. It has thirteen spokes, 360 joints, six rims and
numberless leaves carved upon it (Bhdgavatam 3.21.19).
Here the thirteen spokes are the twelve months plus an extra,
intercalary month that was periodically added to keep the year in line
with the seasons.
The Babylonians used a year of twelve 30-day months, and the
archaeoastronomer Otto Neugebauer comments that this was never
assumed to be the actual length of the year (Neugebauer, 1945, p. 13).
In ancient times, the Chinese had a year of six 60-day periods, which
were divided into 10-day ‘weeks’ (Needham, 1970, p. 397).
The Chinese also divided the circle into 36514 parts, and this
practice may be more recent than that of counting six 60-day periods
(Needham, 1970, p. 82). This indicates both a year of 36534 days and
the idea of dividing the circle by an average day’s journey of the sun.
Of course, when applied to the formal year of 360 days, the same idea
gives us the familiar division of the circle into 360 degrees.
The Mayans in Central America had a 260-day sacred year, a 360
day year of eighteen 20-day “months,” and a 365-day year that was
obtained by adding five unlucky days. In Egypt, the Canopus decree
of 238 B.C. ordered that an extra day was to be added every four years



236 8. Notes on Time and Chronology
to the “360 days and to the five days which it is customary to add to
them” (Budge, 1904, p. 63).
Different peoples expressed the same 360-day year in different
ways, and this indicates that they were following independent path¬
ways of cultural development. This is especially true of the Mayans,
who had a very unique and sophisticated system of astronomy.
However, the 360-day figure itself is one of many small pieces of
evidence suggesting either common cultural roots or extensive com¬
munication between cultures.



General Observations
In the nineteenth-century, Jacobi summed up the general under¬
standing of Puranic cosmology. He wrote
Notwithstanding, or rather because of its visionary character, Pauranic
cosmography became, as it were, an article of faith. The general belief in
it was not shaken even by the introduction of scientific astronomy,
though the astronomers tried to model the traditional cosmography on
the basis of their science (Kay, 1981, p. 15).
For centuries, Puranic cosmology has seemed incomprehensible
to most observers, and this has encouraged many people either to
summarily reject it or to accept it literally with unquestioning faith.
This has certainly been true in recent times. If we go back to the
medieval period, we likewise find that astronomers such as Bhaskara
carya and Paramesvara dismiss Puranic cosmology as imaginary, even
though they use Puranic ideas and terms in their astronomical writing.
At the same time, traditional commentators, such as Sridhara Swami,
discuss the cosmology of the Bhagavatam from the standpoint of direct
literal acceptance.
If we take it literally, the cosmology of the Bhagavatam differs
radically from modern astronomy, and it also suffers from internal
contradictions and violations of common sense. However, these very
contradictions point the way to a different understanding of Bhdgavata
cosmology in which it emerges as a deep and scientifically sophisti¬
cated system of thought.
Study of the contradictions shows that they are caused by
overlapping self-consistent interpretations that use the same textual
elements to expound different ideas. For example, the Bhagavatam
states that the sun god orbits Mount Meru with the mountain to his left
237



238 9. General Observations
and to his right, and this is questioned in the text itself by King
Pariksit. It turns out, however, that the orbiting with Meru on the right
refers to the daily motion of the sun relative to the earth, and it is part
of the interpretation of Bhu-mandala as a planisphere map of the
earth. The orbiting with Meru on the left refers to the sun’s yearly
\
motion relative to the stars, and it is part of the interpretation of Bhu
mandala as a geocentric map of the solar system.
9.1 CONTEXT-SENSITIVE MODELS
Each of these interpretations deserves to be taken seriously
because it is supported by many points in the text that are consistent
with one another and in agreement with modern astronomy. The
contradictions between overlapping interpretations can be under¬
stood as the inevitable outcome of a context-sensitive approach to
exposition in the Bhagavatam.
In the “contex-sensitive” or “multiple-aspect” approach, different
meanings are given to the same subject matter, on the basis of different
contexts. The simplest example of this is found in Renaissance paint¬
ings, in which several scenes in a story are depicted in one picture. We
have given the example of “The Tribute Money” by Masaccio, in
which Saint Peter is seen taking a coin from a fish, speaking to Jesus,
and paying a tax collector. Each of these phases of the Biblical story
makes sense in its own context, but from a literal standpoint it is
contradictory to have Saint Peter doing three things at once.
The context-sensitive method maximizes the amount of informa¬
tion that can be stored in a picture or text, and this reduces the work
required of the artist or writer. At the same time, it means that the work
cannot be taken literally as a one-to-one model of reality, and it
requires the viewer or reader to understand the different relevant
contexts. This can be difficult when knowledge of context is lost over
long periods of time.
In the Bhagavatam, the context-sensitive approach was rendered
particularly appropriate by the conviction that reality, in the ultimate
issue, is avak-manasam or beyond the reach of the mundane mind or
words. This implies that a literal, one-to-one model of reality is
unattainable, and so one may as well pack as much meaning as possible
into a necessarily incomplete description of the universe.



9.2 Realistic Astronomy in the Bhdgavatam 239
9.2 REALISTIC ASTRONOMY IN THE BHAGAVATAM
If we look at the different interpretations that emerge from a study
of Bhagavata cosmology, we find that they combine a clear under¬
standing of the earth and the solar system (out to Saturn), with ideas
concerning demigods and the soul’s travel to higher or lower realms.
No explicit information in the Bhdgavatam refers to physical objects
more than about two billion miles away from the earth. In this sense,
the Bhdgavatam follows the pattern of medieval European cosmology,
which placed the sphere of the fixed stars just outside the orbit of
Saturn.
Nevertheless, the idea of large astronomical distances does arise
in the traditions surrounding the Bhdgavatam. First of all, the Bhdga¬
vatam and other Purdnas speak of a multiplicity of universes, or
Brahmandas, each of which is covered by seven-fold layers with an
aggregate thickness over ten million times its own diameter. The/yo
tisa Sastras, Surya-siddhanta, and Siddhanta-siromani, give the Brah
manda itself an enlarged radius of about 5,000 light years. Finally, the
Mahabhdrata refers to stars as large, self-luminous objects that seem
small because of their great distance, and it remarks that the sun and
the moon cannot be seen if one travels to the stars.
But strictly speaking, the Bhdgavatam sets the diameter of the
Brahmanda to 500 million yojanas, and this equals the diameter of the
Bhu-mandala disk, which cuts it in half. At a traditional length of about
eight miles per yojana, this comes to four billion miles. This is far too
small for the universe of stars and galaxies, but it does fall in the right
range of size for the solar system. (For example the orbit of Uranus has
a radius of about 1.8 billion miles.) This is intriguing, because many
points in the Bhdgavatam support the identification of Bhu-mandala
with the ecliptic plane, which is roughly the plane of the solar system.
Ancient astronomers generally made severe underestimates of the
size of the solar system, and the match in size between Bhu-mandala
and the solar system may therefore seem like a happy coincidence.
However, a remarkable finding emerges if we take this agreement
seriously. Bhu-mandala can be interpreted as a map of the geocentric
orbits of the sun and the five planets, Mercury through Saturn, and this
map becomes highly accurate if we adjust the length of the yojana to
about 8.5 miles. The rough agreement between Bhu-mandala and the



240 9. General Observations
solar system then expands into an accurate agreement between the
subdivisions of Bhu-mandala and the orbits of the sun and the five
traditional planets.
A nearly identical estimate of about 8.6 miles per yojana emerges
in an independent, historical study that does not refer to the Bhagavatam
or to planets, but does connect the yojana with accurate measurements
of the earth. This study, in turn, is linked to a general investigation of
ancient weights and measures, showing that key units of length were
scientifically defined in ancient Egypt and the Near East using geo¬
detic measurements. Going in the opposite direction from India, the
hasta (or cubit) of the 8.6 mile yojana was in use in Indochina in the
temple complex of Angkor Wat.
9.3 ADVANCED ASTRONOMY IN ANCIENT TIMES
If an advanced understanding of geodesy existed sometime before
the modern era, then it is not so remarkable to suppose that advanced
knowledge of spherical astronomy may also have existed. But estab¬
lished reconstructions of history and prehistory do not allow either of
these options.
One way to deal with this is to suppose that coincidence has liber¬
ally come to the aid of the Bhagavatam, bringing it into harmony with
modern astronomy in a number of striking ways. Some points of agree¬
ment could be attributed to empirical knowledge coming into India
from the Greeks. For example, the use of the planisphere in the Bhaga¬
vatam could conceivably be traced back to Ptolemy’s Planisphaerium.
Other, nontraceable points of agreement, such as correlations with
modern orbital distances, could be attributed to chance.
From a mystical point of view, chance and intelligent causation can
be reconciled by the idea that apparent coincidences may actually be
meaningful, since they reflect the workings of an underlying divine
intelligence. Thus, we should not be surprised if apparently coinciden¬
tal patterns in an ancient text prove to harmonize with modern science
in unexpected ways. Indeed, we would expect to find such harmony in
at least some of the world’s inspired texts if the idea of divine inspira¬
tion (important to many religions) is actually valid.
Nonetheless, the thoroughly nonmystical character of our data
on ancient, scientifically defined measures suggests that many of the



9.3 Advanced Astronomy in Ancient Times 241
correlations with modern astronomy in the Bhagavatam may, indeed,
be based on ancient empirical knowledge. We should therefore briefly
consider when and where such knowledge might have originated and
how it might have been transmitted down to the present.
First, let us consider the question of where. The evidence that we
have considered is highly international in character. It does not single
out any particular culture or region as the original source of ideas or
technical developments. Some of the evidence for advanced astronomy
is found in the Bhagavatam, a work from India. Most of the evidence
regarding ancient weights and measures relates to Egypt and the Near
East, but this may be due to the fact that the studies we have examined
deal mainly with these areas.
Seidenberg has argued that geometry and related computational
methods may have originated with the tradition of the Sulvasutras in
India. However, he remarked that these developments require a date
going back at least to 1700 b.c. Since Sanskrit scholars did not give him
such a date, he postulated an unknown pre-Old-Babylonian source for
Sulvasutra mathematics (Seidenberg, 1978, p. 324).
One objection to the idea of advanced mathematics in ancient
times is that surviving mathematical documentation from ancient
cultures may indicate a very elementary level of knowledge. For
example, the Rhind papyrus and other, similar documents suggest to
some scholars that Egyptian mathematics never rose above a very
primitive level (Neugebauer, 1945, p. 4). If more advanced knowledge
ever existed in Egypt, then where are the records proving this?
One answer is that the high precision and geometrical structure of
the great pyramid at Giza indicates that the pyramid builders were not
mathematically primitive. This is supported by the studies of Berriman,
Stecchini, Schwaller de Lubicz, and others on ancient measures. Could
it be that these builders possessed technical knowledge that was later
lost? This is quite possible, since advanced technical knowledge tends
to be restricted to a small elite and is likely to be ignored or quickly
forgotten by the mass of people. Documentary evidence of past scien¬
tific achievements tends to be very scanty, and thus we are in the
unfortunate position of having to infer past developments from exist¬
ing fragmentary remains.
Given these reservations, we can postulate an international body
of ancient scientists, who were physically based in various parts of the



242 9. General Observations
world and who flourished as far back as the Old Kingdom of Egypt.
This hypothesis is set within the accepted framework of ancient
chronology in Appendix 19.
9.4 THE ROLE OF VEDIC CIVILIZATION
We might ask the relationship between Bhdgavata cosmology and
the cosmology of the Vedas in India. We have not specifically studied
the Vedic texts from a cosmological standpoint, but those who have do
not report advanced astronomical knowledge in these texts (Dikshit,
1969a and 1969b). The simple astronomy of the Vedanga Jyotisa also
suggests that Indian astronomy was poorly developed in the post
Vedic period, when this text was apparently written.
One approach is to suppose that the more advanced knowledge
alluded to in the Bhagavatam may have been introduced later on. We
have reason to believe that the tropical zodiac, which is mentioned in
the Bhagavatam, was of Western origin and is not older than about the
second century b.c. The idea of the planisphere could have been
introduced from the West along with the tropical zodiac. One could
argue, for example, that the planisphere idea allowed for a rational
explanation of the pre-scientific Vedic idea that the moon is higher
than the sun.
However, it is strange that even though there are many points in
the Bhagavatam supporting the planisphere interpretation, we find no
evidence indicating that anyone in the medieval tradition of the
Bhagavatam specifically knew about it. If it was introduced into India
from Hellenistic Greek sources in the early centuries of our era, then
it should have been explicitly known in the medieval period along with
other material of Greek affinity expounded in Jyotisa Sastras.
This suggests that the planisphere idea in the Bhagavatam dates back
much further in time, and was forgotten in the medieval period and
later. The correlations between Bhu-mandala and modern planetary
orbits also suggest that the Bhagavatam contains astronomical mate¬
rial dating back to much earlier times, since realistic knowledge of
these orbits is incompatible with the astronomy of classical antiquity.
Since the cosmology of the Bhagavatam is a complex system that
differs in many ways from that of the Jyotisa Sastras, it stands to reason
that it was produced by a different school of thought. We know of many



9.5 The Symbolism of the Cosmic Axis 243
historical contributors to the Jyotisa Sastras, such as Aryabhata and
Bhaskaracarya, but we know of no one who was involved in develop¬
ing Puranic cosmology. This also suggests that the developmental
stage of Puranic cosmology took place in an earlier, forgotten era.
De Santillana and von Dechend refer to the idea of a fossilized
story, a story which has lost its context and is embedded, like a fossil
in a rock, in a foreign cultural matrix. An example is the story of Jack
and the beanstalk, which refers to an man-eating giant that lives in the
sky. This story has survived out of context as a nursery tale, but it may
refer to the near-earth abodes of the Raksasas and Bhutas in the
Bhdgavatam's hierarchy of worlds.
Technical knowledge may also survive in fossilized form. An ex¬
ample is the verse in the Surya-siddhanta that encodes accurate values
for the diameters of the planets (see Appendix 10). This is lodged out
of context in a work where it doesn’t belong, and it seems to have no
precedent in other Indian astronomical works. But it may be based on
a remnant of knowledge that survived from earlier times. The same
could be true of the advanced astronomy in the Bhdgavatam.
9.5 THE SYMBOLISM OF THE COSMIC AXIS
In the Bhdgavatam, sophisticated astronomical information co¬
exists with a philosophical understanding that connects the vertical
axis of the universe (the spin-axis defined by Meru and the polestar)
with the ascent or descent of the soul in spiritual realization. This
understanding is linked in the Puranas with particular themes—such
as the world-mountain and the astral migration of the soul—which can
be found in various forms in cultures all over the world. The spread of
Buddhism from India partly accounts for the transmission of these ideas,
but their presence in Europe, Africa, and North and South America
seems to require an earlier society or movement that spread them.
The Vedic texts appear to contain both the spiritual philosophy of
the cosmic axis and some of the particular details used to express it in
different cultures. Thus they refer a world tree and a primeval, central
mountain from which four rivers emerge. A “cosmogonical boar” dug
this mountain out of the primordial waters, and the mountain and its
surrounding rim of earth still rest upon the waters. The earth divides
the cosmos into an upper and lower region, and there is also a ‘"highest



244 9. General Observations
heaven” (parama vyoma in the Rg Veda) which is beyond both (Kui
per, 1983).
The treatment of the cosmic axis in the Bhdgavatam is closely
linked with the Vedas through the role of Visnu. In the Vedas, Visnu
is known for taking three steps. While discussing this, the Indologist
F. B. J. Kuiper remarked:
While Visnu’s first two steps express his relationship with the two
opposed parts of the cosmos, his third step corresponds to a transcenden¬
tal world in which the two conflicting parties are united in an all
encompassing totality. In this light we can view the poet’s words about
'Asat and sat in the highest heaven.’ They point to a world which
transcends the cosmic antithesis and in which sat and asat have been
reconciled in the synthesis of an all-embracing unity (Kuiper, 1983, p. 20).
Along the cosmic axis there is a division between lower and upper
worlds, with the Asuras representing darkness and chaos (asat) in the
former and the Devas representing light and divine order (sat) in the
latter. In the Bhdgavatam, Visnu is also situated at both ends of the axis,
since He rests on Ananta Sesa next to the Garbhodaka Ocean, and He
also resides in the polestar, Dhruvaloka. Kuiper argues that in the
Vedas, Visnu is transcendental to both the Devas and the Asuras, and
thus He represents the eternal divine order lying beyond the dualities
of the upper and lower worlds. This is also the basic theology of the
Bhdgavatam.
Since the Bhdgavatam is linked to the Vedas, the Vedas contain
rudimentary astronomy, and the Bhdgavatam alludes to advanced
astronomy, it may seem that we are faced with a contradiction. One
resolution may be that the Vedas, as purely religious texts, naturally
say little about astronomy, while the Bhdgavatam, as a Purana, con¬
tains a section devoted to cosmology. The VeddhgaJyotisa, which does
go into detail on astronomy, may be a later work that was appended to
the Vedic tradition (see Appendix 19).
In the Bhdgavatam, the transcendental position of Visnu is sym¬
bolized by the polestar, Dhruvaloka, which is the unmoving center
around which all the stars and planets rotate daily on the wheel of time.
This understanding appears to have suppressed awareness of the
gradual precession of the equinoxes. But if Dhruvaloka refers to an



9.5 The Symbolism of the Cosmic Axis 245
observed star (as opposed to an invisible center of rotation), it may
refer back to the period of about 2500 b.c., when the star Thuban was
situated close to the north celestial pole.
In greater India, this was the period of the Mature Harappan
civilization, characterized by well-planned cities, realistic sculpture,
and a tantalizing, undeciphered script. In Egypt, it was the period of the
construction of the great pyramid at Giza. Harappan measures of
weight apparently survived to recent times in India, and there is a
possible connection between the Harappan weight system and the
later Roman ounce. There is also evidence of sophisticated geodetic
measurements in Egypt at this time (see Appendices 8 and 19).
There were trade links between the Harappan civilization and
Mesopotamia, and there were also links between Mesopotamia and
Egypt. The period of 2500 b.c. (give or take a few hundred years) may
have been the time when both observational astronomy and cosmo¬
logical philosophy were combined in the kind of synthesis that we find
in the Bhagavatam. Of course, to be sure of this, much more research
will be required.

Al. The 28 Naksatras
•
The naksatras are twenty-seven or twenty-eight star constellations
situated along the ecliptic. They play a role in Indian astronomy similar
to that of the twelve constellations of the zodiac in the west. They are
particularly connected with the motion of the moon, which completes
one sidereal orbit in about 27.3 days. The naksatras are identified with
star constellations, each of which has a principal star or “junction star”
{yoga-taraka).
The constellations are irregular in shape, but the naksatras are also
defined to be angular subdivisions of the ecliptic. In one system, there
are twenty-seven subdivisions of 13V30 apiece. In other systems, sub¬
divisions of various lengths are used. The Surya-siddhanta uses twenty
seven equal divisions, and it places the beginning of its first naksatra,
Asvini, 10' west of the principal star of Revati, thought to be Zeta
Piscium (Burgess, 1860, p. 15).
By precession, this star would have been aligned with the vernal
equinox in about 570 A.D. In older lists (e.g. in the Black Yajur Veda
and the Atharva Veda), Krttika is listed as the first naksatra (Burgess,
1860, p. 16). Some have argued that this refers back to a time when
Krttika (the Pleiades) was at the vernal equinox, and this would have
been in about 2200 B.C.
The names of the twenty-eight naksatras are listed in Table Al.l,
along with modern names of the junction stars thought to correspond
to them (as given by Kay, 1981, p. 118). We note that for some junction
stars, the corresponding modern star is uncertain. The naksatras are
assigned presiding deities and constellation figures as shown in Table
A1.2 (Taluqdar, 1916, p. 169). The naksatras are divided into groups
as shown in Table A1.3, according to Sridhara Swami’s commentary on
the Bhdgavatam (Wilson, 1865, pp. 267-68).

A2. Vamsldhara on
Priyavrata’s Chariot
The commentary by Vamsldhara on Bhdgavatam verse 5.1.30
sheds light on how the sun was thought to move in relation to Bhu
mandala. It specifically lends support to the planisphere interpretation
of Bhu-mandala. Although Vamsldhara does not specifically mention
the planisphere interpretation, he makes a number of points which can
be reconciled with astronomy by this interpretation but which do not
make sense otherwise.
Verse 5.1.30:
While Bhagavan Aditya [the sun] illumines the gods’ mountain
[Meru], continuously going around, he heats only half of the land up to
Lokaloka Mountain, and he covers half [with darkness]. Not approving
of this, Priyavrata, having accumulated superhuman power by the wor¬
ship of the Lord, [thought] ‘I shall make night into day.’ With a chariot
built of light of the same speed, he went seven times around, following the
movement of the sun like a second sun.



A2. Vamsidhara on Priyavrata’s Chariot 251
Vamsldhara’s commentary is as follows:
The words tadd hi means during Priyavrata’s government. Not appre¬
ciating the situation (that the sun covers half of the earth) with darkness.
King Priyavrata followed the sun by rising from the eastern direction
when the sun was going to set. He did so not for competing with the sun
but for the happiness of his citizens.
Patahga means the sun and paryakramat means surpassed.
During the months of Jyestha, etc., the sunlight given by King
Priyavrata was cooler than the moonlight and during the months of
Marga-sirsa etc., it was hotter than the sun, especially in the morning and
evening.
It should be understood that King Priyavrata, by the strength of
mystic power could function with his twofold personalities as a king and
the sun, like the sages named Saubhari, etc.
The Visva dictionary refers to the word patahga as a bird and as the
sun, and according to the Amara-kosa, dyumani, tarani, and mitra are
synonyms of the sun.
It is to be known that King Priyavrata, after seven circumambula
tions, was going to continue but was stopped by Lord Brahma. We have
already heard that because of his (Lord Brahma’s) order, Priyavrata was
engaged in ruling the kingdom.
It is to be understood that as there are seven oceans in number, so the
chariots were also seven which were produced by his mystic power. Those
chariots had only one wheel, and they were higher than the chariot of the
sun rotating in a circle.
It is also indicated here that because of the larger measurement of the
outer circles, the chariots were also understood to be accordingly larger.
Others say, “the King desired, ‘May my chariot, though far away, be
visible to the eyes of my citizens of Aryavarta.’ Therefore he made each
chariot twice as big as the previous one.” Because of the larger measure¬
ments of the rims, the oceans made by the chariot wheels are also seen to
be larger.
The duration of (Priyavrata’s) mounting on those seven successively
larger chariots is 25 days and 45.5 ghatikas.
Thus, like the sun. King Priyavrata, from the beginning of daksinayana,
started moving from the northern region to the southern region until the
month of Pausa, and again from the beginning of uttarayana until the end,
by days numbering as many, he moved in the reverse order mounting on
those chariots.
Thus, the traveling from the southern region to the northern region
lasts up to Asadha, but turning round even by the left side of Meru, the



252 A2. Vamsidhara on Priyavrata’s Chariot
sun, when he moves by his own rapid speed which is controlled by the
jyotis-cakra, makes the days gradually decrease every month during
daksinayana. But in uttarayana, the days gradually increase because of
the sun’s slower speed.
However, it should be understood that King Priyavrata, keeping
Meru on the right, moves by his own will to dissipate the night made by
(the absence of) the sun. The days in uttarayana increase even as he
willingly moves slowly, and in daksinayana the days decrease, being
under his willful faster speed.
The appearance and disappearance of the chariots should be known
to be due to his mystic influence.
It should be known that the chariots were only seven in number as
stated before.
It should be explained that after the seven days, it wasn’t proper for
Priyavrata to stop himself, and it is not even heard that someone else
could stop him.
The following points can be made regarding this commentary:
First, it seems that Priyavrata’s chariot(s) reversed the seasons, being
cool and moonlike in summer months and brighter than the sun in
winter months. This makes sense if he always stayed 180° from the sun.
However, Vamsidhara says that “King Priyavrata, from the beginning
of daksinayana, started moving from the northern region to southern
region,” and this is inconsistent, since a reversed sun should start from
south to north at this time.
Another inconsistency involves the statement in 5.1.30 that Priya¬
vrata goes around seven times (sapta-krtvas taranim anuparyakramat).
If these are taken as daily circuits, this creates a problem for VamsI
dhara’s interpretation, which requires Priyavrata to ride for many days.
Vamsidhara deals with this by declaring that Brahma tried to stop Pri¬
yavrata after seven days, but later he says that he couldn’t be stopped.
The period of 25 days, 45.5 ghatikas, multiplied by 7, comes to
about 180.3 days. This is about the time of uttarayana or daksinayana,
assuming a year of 360 days. So it seems that Priyavrata spent one
seventh of the time on each of seven chariots while going from north
to south, and he likewise did the same thing while going from south to
north. Since each chariot carved out an ocean, he spent one-seventh of
the time orbiting in each ocean basin while going from south to north,
and likewise while going from north to south. If he was going around
once per day, he must have been going slower while on the inner



A2. Vamsidhara on Priyavrata’s Chariot 253
oceans (of shorter radius) and faster while on the outer oceans.
Since Priyavrata’s sun was doing the opposite of the real sun, it
follows that the real sun must also spend one-seventh of its time in each
ocean and dvipa during an ayana. Thus, the sun must spiral gradually
in towards the center during daksindyana, and it must spiral gradually
outward during uttarayana. This, of course, is what actually happens in
a stereographic projection of the earth and the sun’s orbit. But if we
take Bhu-mandala as a literal plane, then the sun must greatly change
its distance to the center in the course of an ayana, and this means that
it should greatly change in apparent size—contrary to what anyone
can see. Thus, Vamsldhara’s description makes sense in light of the
planisphere interpretation of the original Puranic account, but it does
not make sense given a literal plane.
However, note Vamsldhara’s comment that (according to some)
Priyavrata’s chariots were made to double in size as they went out so
that people in Aryavarta could see them. This assumes actual move¬
ment out from the center in a literal plane, and it assumes that the
resulting reduction in apparent size is offset by the doubling in size of
the chariots. Thus Vamsidhara was clearly not thinking of the plani¬
sphere interpretation.
Vamsidhara says that the greater length of the day in the summer
is caused by the slower speed of the sun during this period. This
explanation does not make sense, but we find it in several Purdnas. For
example, it is expressed in the Visnu Purana, along with the additional
confusing idea that in winter the sun travels faster in the day and slower
in the night, with the reverse happening in the summer (Wilson, 1980,
p. 319). Of course, the Purdnas recognize that day for one person is
night for someone else, and so this explanation does not work. We do
not find this erroneous explanation in the Bhagavatam.
Thus it appears that the Puranic tradition in Vamsldhara’s day
preserved evidence of a planisphere interpretation of Bhu-mandala,
but this interpretation was not understood within the tradition at this
time.
The Sanskrit text of 5.1.30 says that the sun illuminates half of the
earth’s surface (vasudhd-talam), while the other half is in darkness.
Evidently, Priyavrata illuminated the other half, and thereby created
unbroken daylight. This makes sense for a globe or a planisphere, but
not for a literal plane, where sunlight should fade out gradually in all



254 A3. Archaic Earth Model
directions from the sun, with no sharp demarcation between an
illuminated half and a dark half.
The Siddhdnta-siromani of Bhaskaracarya maps the seven oceans
and dvipas into bands of equal latitude around the earth globe
(Wilkinson, 1861, p. 116). The position of the sun, projected onto the
earth as the zenith point, does move across these bands, from one to
another, during the course of daksinayana and uttarayana. If the
widths of the bands are adjusted properly (which is not done in
Siddhanta-siromani), the sun will spend about one-fourteenth of a
year in each of seven bands, first going north and then going south. This
comes to about 26 days per band. As the sun’s zenith point circles in
each band, half of the earth’s surface, centered on this point, is
illuminated, and the other half is in darkness. Thus, the Siddhdnta
siromani interpretation of the dvipas reconciles Vamsidhara’s under¬
standing with modern science.
It is sometimes argued that the approach taken in Siddhanta-siro
mani and other Jyotisa Sastras was developed after the introduction of
Greek astronomy into India as a means of bringing prescientific Pura
nic cosmology into line with newly introduced scientific concepts.
However, features of the Puranic accounts suggest that they were
originally based on a scientific planisphere projection, whether this
was inspired by Greek ideas or not. This original understanding seems
to have been lost by the time of the known Bhagavata commentators
(from roughly the thirteenth century onwards).
A3. Archaic Earth Model
The scholars Giorgio de Santillana of MIT and Hertha von Dechend
of Frankfurt University have argued in their book Hamlet’s Mill that
the “flat earth” of all ancient cultures was originally celestial.
Based on their study of many traditions, de Santillana and von
Dechend postulated that in ancient times there existed an Archaic
Culture. This culture was spread throughout the world, and it flour¬
ished before the known civilizations of Greece, Babylon, China, and
India. The people of this culture had the following understanding of
the earth:



A3. Archaic Earth Model 255
1. First, what was the ‘earth’? In the most general sense, the ‘earth' was
the ideal plane laid through the ecliptic. The ‘dry earth,’ in a more
specific sense, was the ideal plane going through the celestial equator.
2. The name of ‘true earth’ (or of the ‘inhabited world') did not in any way
denote our physical geoid for the archaics. It applies to the band of the
zodiac, two dozen degrees right and left of the ecliptic.
3. At the ‘top,’ in the center high above the ‘dry’ plane of the equator was
the Pole star. At the opposite top, or rather in the depths of the waters
below, unobserved from our latitudes, was the southern pole, thought
to be Canopus” (de Santillana, 1969, pp. 58, 61-63).
If this cosmological scheme is correct, then the Archaic people had
a sophisticated idea of the earth, and they knew that the earth in this
sense did not correspond directly to what they were standing on. It is
therefore noteworthy that prominent Greek thinkers accepted a
literal flat earth before the rise of classical Greek astronomy. For
example, in the fifth century B.C. the philosopher Thales thought of the
earth as a disk floating on water like a log. About a century later,
Anaxagoras taught that it is flat like a lid and stays suspended in air.
Democratus, in turn, argued that the earth is shaped like a tambourine
and is tilted downwards toward the south (Kirk and Raven, 1963,
pp. 87, 391, 412).
Although some say that Pythagoras, in the sixth century B.C., was
the first to view the earth as a sphere, this idea apparently did not catch
on quickly among the Greeks, and the first attempt to measure the
earth's diameter is generally attributed to Eratosthenes in the second
century B.C.
If de Santillana and von Dechend are correct, then there must have
been a loss of astronomical understanding between the Archaic period
and the time of the pre-Socratic Greek philosophers. After this, Greek
astronomical knowledge underwent a resurgence with the develop¬
ment of mathematical planetary models—a process beginning with
Plato’s contemporary, Eudoxus, and culminating with Ptolemy’s
Almagest in the second century A.D.

The Solar System
*
In modern times, the dimensions of the solar system have been
learned only recently. Now the sun is known to be about 93 million
miles from the earth, but a few centuries ago, it was widely believed to
be much closer.
The first accurate measurement of the earth-sun distance was
made in 1671, and the result was 87 million miles. This measurement
required high-precision telescopes. Observers stationed in Paris and in
the city of Cayenne in French Guiana used telescopes to measure the
direction of Mars. This enabled them to triangulate the distance to
Mars, and the earth-sun distance was computed from this information.
This method requires very accurate measurements, because Paris is
very close to Cayenne, compared with the closest distance from the
earth to Mars.
The most accurate nontelescopic astronomer is said to be Tycho
Brahe, who lived in the late sixteenth century. Using Brahe’s naked
eye observations, the famous astronomer Johannes Kepler concluded
that the earth-sun distance is at least thirteen and a half million miles.
Kepler and his contemporary, Galileo, accepted the heliocentric,
or sun-centered, model of the universe introduced by Nicholas
Copernicus in the sixteenth century. Before this time, Western as¬
tronomers followed the geocentric system expounded by Claudius
Ptolemy in the days of the Roman Empire.
Ptolemy estimated that the distance from the earth to the sun is
about five million miles. This is only one-nineteenth of the modern
value and is typical of estimates made by pretelescopic astronomers.
Ptolemy is often criticized for giving the erroneous geocentric
model, rather than the correct heliocentric one. But geocentric or
heliocentric motion can be seen as a matter of relative point of view.
Newtonian dynamics require the planets to orbit the sun, but one can
still represent planetary motions relative to the earth. In fact, this is
necessary in practice for astronomical observations made from the
earth, and there was a tendency in ancient times for astronomers to



A4. Background on Modeling the Solar System 257
convert heliocentric systems into geocentric ones (van der Waerden,
1987).
Tycho Brahe accepted that the planets other than the earth orbit
the sun, but he kept the earth in the center by having the sun orbit the
earth. Thus his system preserved all relative planetary motions by
combining heliocentric planetary motion with geocentric solar motion.
Seen from the viewpoint of the earth, a planet traces out a looping
path. This path can be approximated with a simple mechanical model
(Figure A4.1). Here, the short arm represents the sun orbiting around
the earth, which is at the center. The long arm represents the motion
of the planet Mars around the sun. In combination, they trace out the
orbit of Mars around the earth. (This simple model omits elliptical
motion, of course.)
Medieval and Renaissance diagrams typically show Ptolemy’s
orbits as simple circles. But Ptolemy actually gave each planet a
realistic, geocentric orbit (Figure A4.2). He erred by making the orbits
too small, and by stacking them up, one inside the other, as we see in the
figure. Indeed, the Ptolemaic orbits out to Saturn are so small that they
would fit within the earth’s orbit, as given in modern astronomy
(Figure A4.3).
For comparison, the actual geocentric orbits of the planets are as
shown in Figure A4.4, according to modern astronomy. Notice that the
curling orbital paths follow off-centered ovals caused by the planets’
elliptical orbits around the sun. A realistic geocentric model like this
one implies an accurate knowledge of relative planetary motion, and
Earth Sun

therefore it probably will be accompanied by at least a theoretical
awareness that the planets orbit the sun. This happened in the case of
Brahe, who knew about the heliocentric model, but preferred to
represent planetary motions geocentrically.

B. L. van der Waerden argued that the heliocentric theory may
have a more extensive historical background than we commonly sus¬
pect. The general story of the heliocentric theory is that it was invented
by Aristarchus of Samos and then taken up centuries later by Coper¬
nicus. However, van der Waerden argued that the system of the Indian
astronomer Aryabhata (fifth-sixth century A.D.) could be traced to a
heliocentric theory cultivated in Persia or Near Eastern countries (van
der Waerden, 1987). One may thus raise the question of whether or not
Puranic astronomy may have been influenced by the heliocentric
theory.
A5. Goodness of Fit
For a yojana length y, the goodness of fit, G(y), is defined as
follows. The terms used in this definition are given in Figure 4.9 (p. 96).
Each boundary curve has two extreme points where it becomes
tangent to a circle centered on the earth. For the outer boundary curve,
these are the apogee of the planet, and the point designated apogee-,
where this boundary curve approaches closest to the earth. For the
inner boundary curve they are the perigee of the planet and the point,
perigee+, where the curve is furthest from the earth. These four points
are called orbital turning points.
By observation, we arrived at the hypothesis that each orbit has at



260 A6. Criteria for Orbital Alignment
least one turning point that matches the radius of a circular feature of
Bhu-mandala. Thus a measure of goodness of fit should be based on
the minimal distance between turning points and circular features for
each planet. Assuming y miles per yojana, we can formally define this
as follows:
For each planet, Mercury through Saturn, find the minimum
difference between a Bhu-mandala feature radius and an orbital
turning point converted into yojanas using y. The difference is ex¬
pressed as a percentage of the width of the Bhu-mandala ring in which
the turning point falls. Take this minimum over the set of all Bhu
mandala circles (listed in Table 2.1, p. 22) and over the set of four
orbital turning points of the planet. Take the root mean square of these
minimal percentage differences for the five planets. The reciprocal of
this is called G(y). It is large if the orbits line up well with the circular
features, and it is small if they do not line up well.
A6. Criteria for Orbital Alignment
It is possible to define several simple criteria that evaluate how
well the planetary orbits line up with the circular features of Bhu
mandala. These are based on the observation that if the alignments
between orbits and features are not coincidental, we would expect
them to follow an orderly pattern, in which all Bhu-mandala features
play a role. In this appendix, we develop this idea.
In Table 4.2 (p. 98), N lists the number of the Bhu-mandala feature
that comes closest to the indicated orbital turning point. We will say
that this feature is used or occupied by that turning point. The feature
numbers, N, are used by the planets as indicated in Table A6.
We would expect a random series of alignments to use some fea¬
tures and omit others in an irregular fashion. So it is noteworthy that
all of the features from 8 to 17 are used in the pattern in this table. We
also see that the small, solid planets (Mercury, Venus, and Mars),follow
a symmetric pattern in the table, centered on the sun. This pattern is
(11,12), (10,13), (8,14), (9,15), with only 8 and 9 switched out of order.
A different pattern is followed by the large, gaseous planets, Jupiter
and Saturn.

Mercury 10 13

The numbers in this table reflect the heliocentric arrangement of
the solar system, and they also reflect the fact that Mercury, Venus, and
Mars (but not Jupiter and Saturn) can come closer to the earth than the
sun. But an arbitrary arrangement of rings would not be expected to
do this in such a regular and symmetric way.
The information in Tables 4.2 and A6 can be evaluated using
several criteria which assess the strengths and weaknesses of the orbit
correlations. These are as follows:
1. First, the following two points are based on the text of the Bha
gavatam:
la. Features beyond the circular Lokaloka Mountain (feature 17)
should not be used in the alignment, since it is said in text 5.20.37
that no luminaries (planets) pass beyond Lokaloka Mountain.
lb. The sun should be somewhere between the center (earth) and
the circular Manasottara Mountain (feature 13), since the sun's
chariot axle extends from Meru to Manasottara (see 5.21.13).
We call these criteria la and lb, respectively, and we assign them 1
or 0 for true or false. Both are satisfied by Table 4.2.
2. In the ideal pattern, each perigee and apogee of a planet (or the sun)
should come close to a Bhu-mandala ring. To show how well this is
satisfied, let n be the number of perigees or apogees within P percent
of their closest feature radius. Using P = 6%, the pattern in Table 4.2



262 A6. Criteria for Orbital Alignment
is assigned 5, but the highest possible value would be 11 (2 for each
planet and at most 1 for the sun).
3. It would be ideal if each feature corresponded to exactly one perigee
or apogee. So let r be the ratio of the number of features with this
property to the total number of features used. The pattern in Tables
4.2 and A6 is assigned r = 8/io by this criterion, since features 8-15
each correspond to one perigee or apogee. In contrast, feature 16
serves for both the apogee and the perigee of Jupiter, since the
apogee lacks a ring of its own. The situation is similar for feature 17
and Saturn.
Ideally, all circular Bhu-mandala features should be used in the
alignment, since unused features would be superfluous in a plan¬
etary map. Criteria 4-6 address this idea:
4. Let n be minus the number of unused features from Jambudvipa up
to the first feature used in the alignment. The minus sign means that
the pattern gets a lower evaluation as n increases. Here the pattern
in Table 4.2 gets a low score of -7, since the used features begin with
number 8.
5. Let m be minus the number of unused features between Lokaloka
Mountain and the outermost used feature. In this case, the pattern
in Table 4.2 is assigned the highest score of 0.
6. Finally, let k be minus the number of blocks of contiguous unused
features in the whole pattern. This measures how much the pattern
is broken up by unused circles. By this measure, the pattern in Table
4.2 is assigned -1.
Criteria 2 through 6 are intended to express what we would expect
to find in a solar system map in which perigees and apogees of
geocentric planetary orbits are represented by a series of concentric
circles. They also express criticisms that can be lodged against the
particular map given in the Table 4.2. To sum up, in such a map, each
perigee or apogee should correspond to a circle, and each circle should
correspond to a perigee or apogee. Criteria la and lb express the
special roles of Lokaloka Mountain and Manasottara Mountain.
Our first observation is that the six criteria can be used to define
the optimal yojana length, without making any reference to the
goodness of fit function, G(y) (see Appendix 5). Consider the range
of possible yojana lengths from 1 to 16 miles. For a given yojana length,



A7. Critical Analysis of the Orbital Study 263
add criteria la, lb, and 2-6 together, using weights designed so that
each criterion varies over the same range on the interval of possible
yojana lengths. This is done to give the criteria equal weight. The
resulting curve C(y) is plotted in Figure 4.10 (p. 97), along with G(y).
(We added 10 to the curve to make it positive.) This curve has a
pronounced maximum at 8.489 miles, close to the maximum of G(y).
A7. Critical Analysis
Of the Orbital Study
It is clear that Bhu-mandala, as described in the Bhagavatam, can
be interpreted as a geocentric map of the solar system out to Saturn.
But an obvious and important question is: Did some real knowledge of
planetary distances enter into the construction of the Bhu-mandala
system, or are the correlations between Bhu-mandala features and
planetary orbits simply coincidental?
One problem with interpretations in general is that they pick out
certain features from a body of material, while neglecting others. This
choice may be dictated by the pattern that is being seen, and thus this
pattern may be imposed by the viewer on the evidence, rather than
being inherent in the evidence itself.
In this case, the decision to give an astronomical interpretation
to an ostensibly geographical description is supported by substantial
material in the text of the Bhagavatam connecting Bhu-mandala and
the adjoining region of Antariksa with the ecliptic (sun’s orbit) and the
planetary orbits. The circular features of Bhu-mandala stand out as
likely candidates for an astronomical interpretation, due to their shape
and due to the fact that they have roughly the right size for planetary
orbits. Also, since they are given dimensions in the text, they can be
examined quantitatively.
Given this starting point, we can carry out a statistical analysis by
defining a null hypothesis as follows: The medieval author of the
Bhagavatam had no access to correct knowledge of planetary dis¬
tances, and therefore all correlations between Bhu-mandala features
and planetary distances are due to chance.



264 A7. Critical Analysis of the Orbital Study
If such a null hypothesis involves a known statistical distribution,
such as a normal distribution, then there are standard statistical
methods for evaluating whether or not the observed data satisfy this
hypothesis. The basic method would be to ask how probable the
correlations in question are, given a statistical distribution of possible
_____ '
Bhu-mandala features. The problem is that we do not know this
statistical distribution.
Nonetheless, by looking at the Bhagavatam’s discussion of dis¬
tances in Bhu-mandala, we can make some general observations about
how these distances were expressed numerically. For example, from
Table 2.1 (p. 22), we see that large powers of 10 were used. Throughout
Puranic literature, numbers such as sahasra (1,000), laksa (100,000),
and koti (10,000,000) are common. Fractions of these numbers, such as
t/2, t/4, and Vs are also common, and we see such fractions in the table.
The table also shows the procedure of doubling a previous distance. In
other parts of the Bhagavatam, we encounter multiples of a previous
distance by ten (i.e. the shells of the Brahmanda).
Table 2.1 presents a combination of regular rules and seemingly
arbitrary decisions, such as the decision to set thickness 16 equal to
radius 13 instead of doubling thickness 15. We took the null hypothesis
to mean that such decisions were made by complex cultural causes that
would be effectively random relative to the unknown dimensions of
the solar system. Thus, we interpret the table as a combination of
regularity and effectively random choice.
Based on such observations, we wrote an algorithm to generate
sets of artificial Bhu-mandala feature radii. This algorithm applies
rules generalized from Table 2.1, and it applies these rules in a random
fashion. We are prepared to make the C code for this algorithm
available for examination. Although the algorithm is in many ways
arbitrary, it generates sets of radii similar to those in the table, and
one particular set of random choices generates the table itself. (In line
with the table, the algorithm also designates one ring as Manasottara
Mountain and another as Lokaloka Mountain.)
We used this algorithm to determine how common are patterns
which satisfy the criteria we have discussed in Appendix 6. The specific
method is as follows: We say that a randomly generated set of radii and
a particular yojana length satisfies a criterion if it does as well or better
by this criterion than the actual set of radii defined in the Table 2.1,



A 7. Critical Analysis of the Orbital Study 265
using 8.489 mileslyojana. Let x and y be two sets of rings and yojana
lengths. If C(x) represents a criterion for x, then x does as well or better
than y on C if C(x)>C(y).
The purpose of the “as well or better” rule is to avoid the following
problem: If we observe that one thing matches another, we may be
misled by adopting loose criteria for a match, so that a match by our
criteria may be quite probable by chance. But if the formal analysis
considers matches that are as loose as those we observe, then it should
reveal whether such loose matches are probable or not.
We combined criteria la and lb into a single criterion, (simply
called 1), and we included the goodness of fit function G(y) as a
seventh criterion.
For each nonempty subset of these seven criteria (127 subsets in
all), we calculated the probability that a randomly generated set of
radii satisfied all the criteria in the subset for some yojana length
between 1 and 16 miles. This was done by using a computer to generate
20,000 random sets of rings, and checking each set for the full range of
yojana lengths. (We used an increment of .00375 miles in yojana
length).

7 27.135 1-7 0.000
The probability that criterion k is satisfied is fairly large for each
k=l,. .. ,7, considered separately. These percentages are listed in col¬
umns 1 and 2 of the above table. But if we combine several criteria, the



266 A 7. Critical Analysis of the Orbital Study
percentage goes down rapidly. This is illustrated in columns 3 and 4.
For example, 0.785% of the trials satisfied all of the criteria from
1 through 5, and none of the trials satisfied criteria 1 through 6 or
1 through 7.
Note that the addition of criterion 4 reduced the percentage only
slightly, from 6.39% to 6.035%. This is due to the fact that the origi¬
nal pattern in Table 4.2 does not score very well on criterion 4, and
therefore many randomly generated patterns do as well or better on
this criterion. However, the addition of criterion 6 reduces the percent¬
age from 0.785% to 0%. This is because the original pattern is not
broken up by unused circles, even though this is likely to happen by
chance.
If we combine criterion 6 with criteria 1,2, and 3 directly, we find
that the four criteria, 1, 2, 3, and 6, are satisfied by only 0.04% of the
trials. Leaving aside 1, we find that 0.105% of the trials satisfy the three
criteria, 2,3, and 6. These are among the strongest criteria, in the sense
that no more than about one set of artificial radii in a thousand do
better than Table 4.2 on these three criteria combined, for some yojana
length between 1 and 16 miles.
Criterion 7, the goodness of fit function G(y), also has a strong
effect, especially in combination with 6. Thus the combination 2,6, and
7 is satisfied for 0.23% of the trials and 3,6, and 7 is satisfied for 0.03%.
The combination 2,3,6, and 7 was satisfied for only 1 of the 20,000 trials
(0.005%).
One might ask: Why look at combinations of criteria that yield
a low probability? Why not look at single criteria, or at combina¬
tions yielding a high probability, and conclude that the observed orbit
correlations are quite probable? The answer is that all of our criteria
are reasonable features of an orbital map and thus all should be
considered in a statistical assessment. This yields a probability of
less than 1 in 20,000 trials. (The addition of further criteria, which we
have overlooked, would simply decrease this probability further.)
It is interesting to see, however, which criteria contribute most
strongly to the low probability, and we therefore examined different
combinations.
Criteria 2 through 6 are general in nature, and they are designed
to penalize irregularities in the correlation between Bhu-mandala



A8. Ancient Metrology 267
features and perigees and apogees of planets. Ring patterns satisfying
criteria 2, 3, and 6 for some yojana length have a probability of about
0.1%, and this probability goes down sharply as more criteria are
added. It can be concluded that patterns of rings satisfying such
combinations of criteria are quite rare in the output of our pattern
generation algorithm, which was intended to create sets of rings similar
to those of Bhu-mandala in the Bhagavatam. This goes against the null
hypothesis, which says that any correlation between Bhu-mandala
features and planetary orbits must be coincidental. The alternative to
the null hypothesis is that some real knowledge of planetary distances
may have entered into the construction of the Bhu-mandala system in
the Bhagavatam.
A8. Ancient Metrology
The mathematician R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz remarked that units
were sometimes used with variable lengths in ancient Egypt. He gave
the following example of the use of the Egyptian fathom in the temple
of Luxor:
The strange rhomboidal distortion of the plans of the west pylon
prompted us to measure them carefully several times, rectifying the gaps
between the stones (which are sound in this location)—gaps caused by
settling or other accidental causes.
The length of the pylon under the cornice, between tori, gives, from
the north side (along 12 fathoms), the meridian fathom at 90 degrees
(North Pole), and from the south side the meridian fathom at 0 degrees
(Equator); that is, respectively 1.86166 m and 1.8429 m (difference along
12 fathoms = 22.5 cm).
This could be coincidence, but these measurements recur at several
important points; let us therefore concede a repeating coincidence . . .
(Schwaller de Lubicz, 1977, p. 66).
By “meridian fathom” at a given latitude, Schwaller de Lubicz
means a unit of measurement that is roughly the span of a man’s out¬
stretched arms, but which is precisely defined to be one-thousandth
the length of the minute of latitude. This unit varies when defined for



268 A8. Ancient Metrology
different latitudes because the length of a minute of latitude varies as
one goes from south to north. This is caused by the fact that the earth
globe is slightly oblate.
One may speculate that units representing different latitudes were
used in temple construction to symbolize the earth as a whole. But to
say that the Egyptians consciously used such scientifically defined
units is an extraordinary claim, since they supposedly thought the
earth was flat and knew nothing about the oblateness of the earth
globe. Therefore Schwaller de Lubicz spoke of coincidences.
However, such coincidences turn out to be widespread and sys¬
tematic. The scholar Livio Stecchini maintained that “The Egyptians
had measured the circumference of the earth and had realized that
degrees of the meridian become longer as one moves to the north.
They established a geodetic system with benchmarks for the purpose
of showing that the main physical features of Egypt fit the patterns of
meridians and parallels” (Stecchini, 1961, p. 19). He claimed that this
accomplishment was part of a widespread system of scientifically
defined weights and measures developed in the earliest phases of
known civilization. According to Stecchini,
The scholars to whom we are most indebted for the decipherment of
the Sumerian language, Julius Oppert and Carl Friedrich Lehmann
Haupt, proved that by the time the Sumerians wrote their first texts at the
beginning of the third millennium B.C., they were in possession of a highly
scientific system of measures, linking length, volume, and weight with the
highest precision. All the measures used in the Old World, up to the
adoption of the French metric system, are related to this system (Stecchini,
1966, p. 163).
Not surprisingly, many notable scholars reject such claims. Thus
the historian of science Otto Neugebauer deplored “Fantastic ideas
about the level and importance of astronomy in the earliest periods of
Babylonian history,” which “led to theories which brought measures
of time and space in close relationship with alleged astronomical
discoveries” (Neugebauer, 1945, p. 27). But the coincidences that lead
to such ideas are there, and the question is, are they mere products of
chance, or are they traces of a forgotten empirical science?
A thorough survey of the field of ancient metrology—the study of
ancient weights and measures—is a monumental task that lies far



A8.1 Tracking the Artaba and the Roman Pound 269
beyond the scope of this work. However, in this section we will briefly
examine a few topics in this field for the purpose of acquainting the
reader with the nature of metrological evidence. We will note some of
the claims made by Stecchini and others and present the results of our
own research.
A8.1 TRACKING THE ARTABA
AND THE ROMAN POUND
We begin with units of weight. Stecchini defines the artaba, A, as
90 Roman pounds or librae, where each libra is 12 Roman ounces, or
uncia, of 27 gm (Stecchini, 1971, p. 312). The libra is therefore 324 gm,
and the artaba is 29,160 gm. Stecchini also defines a “geometric libra”
of 81/80 librae, or 328.05 gm. He explains that the ratio of 81/so comes up
frequently in the study of ancient weights.
For comparison, the famous Egyptologist Flinders Petrie pointed
out that many types of Roman libra were created by Romans, Greeks,
and others under the influence of unification with other standards of
weight (Flinders Petrie, 1929, p. 145). He lists three specifically Roman
variants of the uncia as 26.7 gm (Roman trade), 27.02 gm (Roman
solidi), and 27.28 (Roman aurei). These figures agree moderately well
with Stecchini’s libra and geometric libra, since the geometric uncia
comes to 27.34 gm.
We can find a closer confirmation of Stecchini’s units by examining
medieval and modern English weights, which are known to be rooted
in classical antiquity. These include the Troy and Avoirdupois pounds,
which are still used today, and the Tower pound, which was used in the
mint at the Tower of London during the Middle Ages.
The Tower pound was abolished by Henry VIII in 1527. The
relevant Exchequer minute illustrates how historical documentation
can define relationships between units:
Now it is determined by the King’s Highness and the said councelle,
that the foresaid pounde Tower shall be no more used and occupied, but
al ma'ner of golde and sylver shall be wayed by the pounde Troye, which
maketh XII oz Troye, which exceedeth the pounde Tower in weight iii
quarters of the oz (Berriman, 1953, p. 152).
This means that a Tower pound is 11.25 Troy ounces, and the mass



270 A8. Ancient Metrology
ratio of (Tower lb)/(Troy lb) is therefore 11.25/12 or 15/i6.
The Tower pound was divided into 12 Tower ounces, and 16 Tower
ounces defined the widely used Mercantile pound (libra mercatoria).
It turns out that the Tower ounce is fundamental to Stecchini’s system.
He sets the artaba equal to 1000 Tower ounces, and we have the
following equations:
100 Tower ounce = 108 uncia
1,000 Tower ounce = 1,080 uncia = artaba = A
16 Tower ounce = 15 Troy ounce = Mercantile lb
70 Tower ounce = 72 Avoirdupois ounce
Using the modern value for the Troy ounce, the value of A is
almost exactly 29,160 gm, as given by Stecchini. The question is, how
accurately is this modern value reproduced by ancient data?
The engineer A. E. Berriman (1953, p. 136) pointed out that the
livre poid de marc used in France before the metric system is 3/2 libra
(to which he gave a slightly different value than Stecchini). The history
of this unit gives some insight into how ratios such as 3/2 come about.
In the ninth century, the Caliph A1 Ma’mun (786-833) is reputed
to have sent the yusdruma, or later Arab pound, to Charlemagne, who
adopted it as the livre esterlin (Hallock and Wade, 1906, pp. 38-39).
Between 1076 and 1093, Philip I defined the marc to be 2b of this unit.
Then King John the Good doubled it, producing the livrepoid de marc.
From the yusdruma to the prerevolutionary livre, the ratio to the libra
went from 9/s to 3A to 3/2, and in earlier times it may have gone through
other, similar transformations.
When the metric system was adopted, the livre was defined as
489.506 gm. This gives us a libra about .25 gm less than Stecchini’s 324
gm figure.
The important point here, is that royal edicts generally change
units by rational numbers such as 9/s or 16/i5. If one can track these
numbers historically, then one can be sure of the theoretical value of
a sequence of related units over the centuries. One can then compute
what ancient units should have been by using modern values for
related units. The results can be checked by measuring ancient weights
or other measures found in archeological sites. Here, of course, we
must recognize that weights and measuring rods used by ancient



A8.1 Tracking the Artaba and the Roman Pound 271
merchants may not have agreed closely with the standards accepted at
that time. Taking this into account, our study suggests that ancient
units have, in fact, been transmitted down to modern times with
impressive accuracy.
The Romans had a measure of volume, called the amphora or
quadrantal, that contained 80 librae of water. Stecchini points out that
there was also an enlarged quadrantal that contains 81 librae, or
equivalently 80 geometric librae. The enlarged quadrantal is 0.02%
larger than the modern Russian chetverik of 26,238.75 cc, that was still
in use up to the time of the Bolshevik revolution. (Stecchini points out
that chetverik means quadrantal in Russian.) Here we assume that
1 cc of water weighs 1 gm.
Direct assessment of the volume of Roman vessels gives a less
accurate confirmation. Thus Flinders Petrie lists 25,807 to 26,300 cc for
80 librae of water, while Stecchini’s two quadrantals are 25,920 and
26,244 cc (Flinders Petrie, 1929, p. 144). These estimates are consistent
with the libra, but the measured values for a variety of Roman con¬
tainers are all considerably larger.
Here is an example of this discrepancy. Wilfred Airy measured a
first century bronze congius of six Roman sextarii, which was labeled
P. X., meaning 10 pounds. This is the appropriate weight, since there
are 6x8 sextarii to the amphora of 80 librae of water. But the vessel
turned out to actually contain 10.1 Roman pounds of distilled water
(Airy, 1908-9, p. 167).
Weights closer to the artaba are reported from Knossos in Crete.
Sir Arthur Evans reported that in the archeological excavations of the
palace of Minos at Knossos, a standard talent weight was found in the
form of a purple gypsum block covered with a bas-relief carving of an
octopus. This weight scales at exactly 29,000 gm—about 0.6% lower
than the artaba.
In addition, nineteen copper ingots were found walled up in the
basement of the palace of Hagia Triada. Evans reported that “The
average weight of these ingots—which themselves do not vary
greatly in weight—is 29,131.6 grammes, and two of them weigh exactly
29 kilogrammes” (Evans, 1935, p. 652). The ingots are about 0.1%
lighter than the artaba, on the average. It seems apparent that Stec¬
chini’s artaba did exist, with connections through related units all
the way to the Tower of London. Evans remarks that the octopus



272 A8. Ancient Metrology
weight is a “light talent of a peculiarly Egyptian type,” and this
jibes with Stecchini’s contention that the artaba originated in
Egypt.
Hallock and Wade state that the original Greek standard of weight
was the heavier Babylonian talent, which was used in the Greek island
of Aegina and spread from there to Sparta and Corinth. In about 592
B.C., the Athenian ruler Solon decreed a smaller talent, equal to 3/s of
the Babylonian talent, in order to release the people from usurers
(Hallock and Wade, 1906, p. 27). Solon divided this Attic talent into 60
minas, and “the same weight of water contained in the amphora was
divided into 80 pounds, thus making 3 attic minas equal to 4 Roman
pounds” (Hallock and Wade, 1906, p. 28).
This might be taken to imply that the Roman libra was defined
after Solon’s decree. However, Hallock and Wade also say that the
Roman pound was originally established as 9/io of the Aeginetan half
mina, which is lh of V60 of the Babylonian talent. This gives the same
value for the Roman pound.
A8.2 THE HARAPPAN UNCIA
There is evidence suggesting that the Roman libra has a history
going back long before the beginning of the Roman Empire. The
excavation of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa revealed a large number of
small, rectangular stone blocks, made mostly of chert and of other hard
rocks, such as gneiss. It turned out that these were weights belonging
to a graded system.
Table A8.1 lists the results of weighing 331 of these weights, as
described by A. S. Hemmy in the report of the excavations of Mohenjo
daro between 1927 and 1931 (Hemmy, 1938). The third column, under
Ratio, indicates the ideal ratio between each successive weight and the
smallest weight. With one exception, the smaller weights increase by
powers of two, and thus they could easily be used to weigh objects in
a balance by a binary system.
Note that the most common weight is 27.405 gm, which is close to
the Roman uncia. (This was first observed by Berriman, 1953, p. 34.)
This weight was calculated by averaging 94 weights that fell between
26.312 and 29.225 gm. We can also get an average based on all 331
weights by dividing each weight by its ratio in column 3, to get the



A8.2 The Harappan Uncia 273
corresponding unit weight, near .87 gm. These unit weights can be
averaged, using the numbers of specimens of each weight as weighting
factors. This, multiplied by 32, gives an average of 27.438 gm for the
most common weight. For comparison, the geometric uncia is 27.34 gm.
John Mitchiner (1978) published evidence showing that the Indus
Valley weights survived as contemporary or near contemporary In¬
dian weights. His data are in Table A8.2. Note that the equivalent of
the uncia comes to 27.28 gm in this report.
The culture of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa is provisionally dated
from about 2600-2500 B.C. to 1900 B.C., using C-14 dating (Lai, 1998,
p. 114). If the weight of about 27.438 gm survived historically to
become the Roman uncia (and as a recent Indian weight), then
wemight wonder how this could be possible, given the range of
variation in these weights. One would think that variation over the

centuries would greatly alter the weight standard, even if it remained
in continuous use through a succession of cultures.
The answer is that empirical measurements of artifacts found in
archeological sites can only tell us about weights and measures in
common use in the marketplace. They do not tell us about carefully
conserved standard units which would be kept in small numbers in the
royal palace or in suitable government buildings. These standards
would have been kept with great care, and they would have been
gradually passed from one society to another, as we saw in the post
Roman history of the French livre. Certainly, if the Roman uncia could
survive the Middle Ages and reach modern times, then under other
names it could have descended from the time of the Indus Valley
civilization. A similar story could apply to the history of this weight in
India.
Hemmy computed the degree of scatter in the weights in each of
the categories in Table A8.1. For the uncia weight, the ratio of scatter
to weight was 1.34%, and these ratios were somewhat higher for the
other weights. He commented for all of the weights that “this ratio is
much lower than is found in other countries at about the same period;
it appears to point to a stricter regulation of commerce” (Hemmy,
1938, p. 603).
The weight system of the Harappan culture cannot be directly
derived from the contemporary systems of weights and measures in the



A8.2 The Harappan Uncia 275
Near East, although there is an indirect relationship. Table A8.3 lists
measured values of weights belonging to the ‘"light Babylonian sys¬
tem” of ancient Iraq, as given by Sir John Marshall in his report on the
Mohenjo-daro excavations. (Marshall, 1973, p. 592). Stecchini defines
the Sumerian sila as artaba/60 and the shekel as sila/60 (Stecchini 1971,
p. 312). In this table the mina corresponds to the sila.
The weights in this table show a great deal of variation, and this
tends to be most extreme for the smallest weights. The third column
gives the ideal ratio between the talent and the given weight. The
fourth column gives the implied talent obtained by multiplying the
given weight by this ratio. These can be compared with the artaba
enlarged by 81/so, or 29524.5 gm. The rightmost column gives a running
average of the percentage difference between the implied talent and
this enlarged artaba. This is under 1% for all but the smallest
weights.

276 A8. Ancient Metrology
Thus the Babylonian weights seem to be based on subdivisions of
a large weight, which is close to the enlarged artaba. In contrast, the
Indus Valley weights seem to be multiples and fractions of a small
weight corresponding to the enlarged or “geometric” uncia.
\
A8.3 ANCIENT FEET
In his empirical study of ancient units of length, Flinders Petrie
included the versions of the “foot” listed in Table A8.4.
Each of these units was used in Greece, and for each one we list in
column two the average of the empirically measured values reported
by Flinders Petrie. Each unit turns out to be almost exactly 1.02 times
the one before it in the list, and this suggests that they are all related.
TABLE A8.4
Ancient Units that Approximate the Foot
Unit Measured Calculated
Roman foot 29.585 cm 29.595 cm
Hasta/1.5 30.175 cm 30.238 cm
Olympic foot 30.903 cm 30.907 cm
Babylonian foot 31.555 cm 31.579 cm
The Babylonian foot can be derived from the enlarged artaba,
namely 81 A/80. Simply define a palm to be the cube root of the mina
defined as t/60 of the enlarged artaba. The Babylonian foot is four of
these palms. These steps reduce down to the cube root of 1.08A, and
they generate the computed value listed in column 3. If the Babylonian
foot is truly Babylonian in origin, it confirms the identity of the light
Babylonian talent as the enlarged artaba.
The Olympic foot is the cube root of the enlarged artaba. The
Roman foot is the cube root of the quadrantal, or amphora, which is
8A/9. Their computed values are also listed in column 3. The Greek
stadium was defined to be 600 Olympic, or Greek, feet. Since Pliny
stated that the stadium contains 625 Roman feet (Berriman, 1953,



A8.4 Metric Cubits 277
p. 116), it follows that the ratio of Greek to Roman feet should be
25/24. In fact, 25/24 is close to the ratio of the computed values given in the
table.
Hasta is the Sanskrit term for the cubit, or distance from the elbow
to the end of the hand. The unit listed above as hasta was so-called by
Flinders Petrie because it was found in measurements of rock-cut
temples at Elora in India (Flinders Petrie, 1877, pp. 126-27). We have
divided his average value by 1.5 to convert it from a cubit to a foot for
comparison with the three other feet. Since this unit was also used in
Greece, we can infer a connection between Western and Indian units.
Just as there were several different units of length used in the ancient
Western world, we might also expect to find several different lengths
of the hasta, some of which were related to Western measures.
The ratio of 1.08A to 81 A/80 is 16/i5, and the ratio of 1.08A to
8A/9 is very close to 16/i5 cubed. By analogy, each term in the series in
Table A8.4 should be the cube root of 8A/9 times a power of 16/i5. This
gives us an estimate of hasta as the cube root of 16A/5, and this (over
1.5) is also listed in column 3.
We noted above that the heavier Babylonian talent was the orig¬
inal Greek standard of weight, according to Hallock and Wade. Based
on their figures, the quadrantal of 80 librae must equal 3/s of the Bab¬
ylonian talent, so that the latter is 40/27 of the artaba. The heavier Babyl¬
onian talent is therefore 43,200 gm. Hallock and Wade point out that
the cube root of this weight, considered as a cube filled with water, is
a unit of length, which they misidentify as the Olympic cubit or 1.5
Olympic feet (Hallock and Wade, 1906, p. 27). Actually, this unit turns
out to be the foot defined as 2b of the Egyptian royal cubit. By this
calculation, the royal cubit comes to 52.632 cm, a figure given by
(Stecchini, 1971, p. 320). If we simplify the calculation, we find that the
royal cubit is the cube root of five times the artaba, and this formula is
also given by Stecchini.
A8.4 METRIC CUBITS
Both Stecchini and Schwaller de Lubicz argue that the royal cubit
was defined in several different ways, resulting in different lengths that
were used for different applications. In one, the average degree of
latitude for Egypt (about 27°) was divided into 210,000 cubits of about



278 A8. Ancient Metrology
52.7 cm. This cubit was used in the nilometer of Elephantine, and the
stadium defined as 300 of these cubits was used by Eratosthenes in
his measurement of the size of the earth (Schwaller de Lubicz, 1998,
p. 299).
A widely used form of the cubit was defined as one sixth of the
circumference of a circle of one meter in diameter (Schwaller de
Lubicz, 1998, p. 289). This comes to Kk m or 52.36 cm. Here the use of
the meter may seem anachronistic, since this unit was originally
defined in 1791 as one ten-millionth of the meridian quadrant from the
equator to the north pole (Berriman, 1953, p, 142).
However, Schwaller de Lubicz maintains that the meter was used
in Egyptian monuments, and he gives many examples (e.g. Schwaller
de Lubicz, 1998, pp. 932-33). He says that the meter was also defined
by the Egyptians to be one ten-millionth of the meridian quadrant.
This, of course, assumes that the Egyptians not only knew that the
earth is a globe but were able to accurately measure it.
The fathom was also defined in terms of geodetic measurements.
This unit is roughly the length of a man’s outstretched arms, but it is
defined exactly as one thousandth of a minute of latitude. Since the
minute of latitude varies as one goes from north to south, this unit
could take on different values ranging from 1.843 m for the equator to
1.861 m for the north pole. According to Schwaller de Lubicz, these
values were used systematically in Egyptian monuments (Schwaller de
Lubicz, 1998, p. 299).
He argues that the mean fathom was used to define the Egyptian
meter (e-meter for short). There are 60x90x1000 mean fathoms in the
meridian quadrant, and this means that 100 e-meters equal 54 mean
fathoms. Curiously, if we take the fathom defined for 45° of latitude
(i.e. 1.852189 m) as the mean fathom, then the e-meter comes to
1.000182 m. The meter is presently defined so that the meridian
quadrant is equal to 10,001,970 m, and therefore it is 10,000,150 e
meters—very close to 10 million.
We can check these units by consulting the scientific survey of the
great pyramid conducted by the engineer J.H. Cole in 1925. Using
modern surveying techniques, Cole found that the lengths of the sides
of the great pyramid are 230.357 m, 230.253 m, 230.391 m, and 230.454
m for the west, north, east, and south sides, respectively (Stecchini,
1971, p. 364). There are said to be 440 royal cubits in each side of the



A8.5 Latitudes in Ancient Egypt 279
great pyramid (Berriman, 1953, p. 78). Using the Cole’s average for
the length of a side, this gives us a royal cubit of 52.355 cm, close to
the value obtained from K/e.
We get an even closer agreement by observing that there are 500
fathoms in the perimeter of the great pyramid. This gives a fathom of
1.84291 m, which corresponds to a latitude of 0° (the equator). In
Section 4.5.3, we noted that the hasta of the short yojana goes almost
exactly 2000 times into the perimeter of the great pyramid. Indeed, this
hasta is equivalent to the cubit of the Egyptian fathom defined at the
equator.
A8.5 LATITUDES IN ANCIENT EGYPT
Stecchini makes many points in support of the controversial claim
that the ancient Egyptians made accurate measurements of latitude
and longitude and were aware that the length of a degree of latitude
changes as one moves north or south. Unfortunately, it is difficult to
check many of his assertions, because he said he could not present the
textual evidence that backs them up due to lack of space (Stecchini,
1971, p. 332). However, some of his statements can be checked, and we
will give one example.
He refers to three Egyptian measuring rules found at the Temple
of Amon in Thebes. In 1921, the famous Egyptologist Ludwig Bor
chardt published a report on these rules, in which he pointed out that
they contain an inscription referring to distances in Egypt. The inscrip¬
tion states that the distance from Syene to Pi-Hapy is 86 atur, the
distance from Pi-Hapy to Behdet is 20 atur, and the distance from
Syene to Behdet is 106 atur.
Stecchini argues that the latitude of Syene can be taken as 24° N,
a traditional ancient value for the latitude of the Tropic of Cancer. He
says that Behdet was a predynastic center on the Mediterranean coast
at the northernmost point of the Nile delta, and he gives it a latitude of
31.5° N (Stecchini, 1971, pp. 293-94). Using modern geodetic calcula¬
tions, this gives a distance along the meridian of 831.122 km from
Syene to Behdet.
Borchardt observed that the length of an atur in royal cubits must
be expressed by numbers such as 5,000 or 10,000. By assuming that the
distance from Syene to Behdet was measured along the winding course



280 A8. Ancient Metrology
of the Nile, he concluded that it should be around 20,000 cubits.
Stecchini disagrees, saying that if we take 15,000 royal cubits per atur,
we find that the north-south distance in latitude from Syene to Behdet
is very close to 106 atur. In fact, using the royal cubit of 52.36 cm, and
assuming 106 atur in the 831.122 km from Syene to Behdet, we find that
the length of an atur comes to 14,974.739 royal cubits. This is certainly
close to 15,000 cubits.
Given that Pi-Hapy is 20 atur from Behdet at 31.5° N and 86 atur
from Syene at 24° N, we can compute what the latitude of Pi-Hapy
should be to give these proportional distances. This comes to 30° 5.135'
N, taking into account the variation in the degree as we go from south
to north. Stecchini argues that Pi-Hapy, called Nilopolis by the Greeks,
was on the right bank of the Nile, facing the southern tip of the island
al-Warraq (Stecchini, 1971, p. 335). This latitude gives a good match
for its position. I note that if the distances of 20 and 86 atur had
indicated distances along the winding course of the Nile, then we
would not expect this geodetic calculation to work out so well.
Using the royal cubit of 52.36 cm, we find that 12x106x15,000 royal
cubits equals 9,990,288 m, which is close to the meridian quadrant.
(The error is -0.11%.) Thus the meridian quadrant is very close to
twelve times the traditional length of Egypt, as Stecchini points out.
Stecchini argues that the traditional length of Egypt was divided
into 1,800,000 geographic cubits (Stecchini, 1971, p. 317). This, he says,
is the origin of the artaba, which is the cube of the geographic foot
(2/3 of a geographic cubit), and which shows up in so many measure¬
ment systems. From this, we can use our length of 831.122 km to
calculate that the artaba should be 29,167.76 gm, and this can be
compared with Stecchini’s figure of 29,160 gm.
Six feet or four cubits should equal one fathom. Using the geo¬
graphic foot just calculated, the fathom should be 1.8469 m, corre¬
sponding to a latitude in the middle of Egypt, between 27° and 28°. This
links Stecchini’s geographic foot with one of the fathom lengths
discussed by Schwaller de Lubicz.
A8.6 CONCLUSIONS
In this section we have seen a hint of the many relationships that
run through ancient weights and measures. Although some of these



A9. Origins of Mathematics 281
relationships may be coincidental, there seems to be good evidence
that many units have been accurately transmitted from one culture to
another over the centuries. More controversial is the claim that ancient
units were based on sound knowledge of the shape and size of the
earth. Here too, there may be coincidences. Nonetheless, the many
correspondences between units and geodetic quantities strongly sug¬
gest that advanced knowledge of the size and shape of the earth did
exist in early civilizations.
This implies a loss of scientific knowledge at some point in ancient
times. Eratosthenes is famous for having carried out a pioneering
measurement of the size of the earth during the Hellenistic period in
Egypt. In his day, advanced geographic knowledge evidently did not
exist among the Greeks and the Egyptians, and so a decline in knowl¬
edge must have taken place. Indeed, Pierre-Simon de Laplace (1884)
was convinced that Eratosthenes based his work on fragments of
earlier advanced knowledge. The implied breakdown in knowledge is
not surprising, since we know that an even greater decline in scientific
knowledge occurred in Europe after the fall of the Western Roman
Empire.
A9. Origins of Mathematics
Evidence for advanced mathematical ability in ancient times is
given by the formula 1;24,51,10 for the square root of two, found
inscribed on Old Babylonian cuneiform tablets (Neugebauer and
Sachs, 1945, p. 43). This formula is written in sexagesimal notation,
where successive numbers are divided by ascending powers of 60
(starting with 60° = 1) and then summed. If we square this, the result
differs from two by less than 1.7 millionths.
It is interesting to consider how this value of V2 was computed.
Unfortunately, this is not specified in the texts. However, Neugebauer
and Sachs argue that a method of successive approximations was used.
If a is an estimate of V2, then 2/a is an estimate on the other side of V2,
and (a+2/a)/2 should be an even closer estimate. If we start with a=l
and apply this method three times, we get the estimate 1 ;24,51,10 by
truncating higher-order sexagesimal terms.



282 A9. Origins of Mathematics
This suggests that the Old Babylonians (dating back to about 1700
B.C.) had the idea of computing successive approximations using an
algorithm. This is a very powerful idea that could have been used in
many other applications.
Turning to India, A. Seidenberg gives the following expression for
V2 from the Sulvasutra of Apastamba (Seidenberg, 1978, p. 327):
1 + 1/3 + l/(3x4) - 1/(3x4x34)
This is 577/(17x24), and it is the exact result of applying the above
method of successive approximations three times, starting with a=l.
(This is slightly less accurate than the Babylonian result, since sexa¬
gesimal rounding happened to produce an improvement.) It would
seem that this method or something equivalent to it became widely
known in ancient times.
The Sulvasutras are a group of texts that explain how to use geom¬
etry to construct altars for fire sacrifices. The Sulvasutra of Apastamba
has been dated to the third century B.C., or somewhat earlier, but it
may preserve a much older tradition. Seidenberg cites passages from
the Satapatha Brdhmana referring to altar constructions of the kind
given in the Sulvasutras. Although the Satapatha Brdhmana is not a
mathematical text, Seidenberg infers that the mathematics of altar
construction given in the Sulvasutras must have been in use at the time
the Satapatha Brdhmana was written.
Since this goes back to before the sixth century B.C., before the
time of Classical Greece, it follows that the Sulvasutras could not have
borrowed from classical Greek geometry (Seidenberg, 1978, p. 323).
Seidenberg concludes that since Greek geometry resembles Sulvasutra
geometry both in principles and details, it must be that Greek geom¬
etry either originated from Indian geometry or both descended from
a common source.
The Pythagorean theorem is present in the Sulvasutras, in Babylo¬
nian mathematics, and, of course, in Greek geometry. In Sulvasutras
it is applied in altar construction, where there is a need to construct a
square with an area equal to the sum of the areas of two other squares.
Seidenberg suggests that this is the setting in which the theorem first
arose.



A9. Origins of Mathematics 283
Seidenberg argues that the Sulvasutras contain a geometric tradi¬
tion that goes back before Old Babylonian times. He points out that
the Sulvasutras present geometric constructions, and they contain
what he calls geometric algebra, or algebraic calculations expressed
through geometric constructions. In contrast, even though Babylonian
mathematics contains similar material, it is expressed in a purely com¬
putational form.
Otto Neugebauer had concluded in the 1930s that “What is called
Pythagorean in the Greek tradition had better be called Babylonian”
(Seidenberg, 1978, p. 307). B. L. van der Waerden argued that the
Greek emphasis on geometric constructions rather than computations
can then be explained as a response to the Pythagorean discovery of
irrational quantities (such as V2). Some of these quantities can be
exactly constructed geometrically, but they cannot be exactly calcu¬
lated. However, the existence of Sulvasutra geometry before the days
of Pythagoras throws a monkey wrench into this theory.
Seidenberg argues that the Indians are not likely to have geom
etrized Babylonian computational procedures. Since Sulvasutra ge¬
ometry is entirely bound up with ritualistic procedures involved with
building altars for fire sacrifices, he also considers it unlikely that it
could have been derived from Greek geometry—even if the dates
would have allowed this. Vedic priests were not likely to incorporate
foreign abstract mathematics into their rituals, but they may have
incorporated geometric methods developed in their own culture or
handed down from an ancestral culture. If Greeks borrowed sacred
geometry, they might have secularized it—and there is at least one
Greek reference to doubling the size of an altar (Seidenberg, 1962,
pp. 493-94). Babylonians might likewise have dropped geometric
constructions and emphasized pure computation (as we tend to do
today with analytic geometry).
Seidenberg proposes that Sulvasutra geometry is the source of
both Old Babylonian mathematics and Greek geometry. But since
Indologists do not allow a date for Vedic culture in India as far back as
the Old Babylonian period (c. 1700 B.C.), he therefore postulates an
unknown source of this geometric tradition.
This confronts us with the mysterious chronology of Babylon.
Babylonian mathematics is said to have flourished in 1700 B.C. Then



284 A9. Origins of Mathematics
there is a gap of 1300 years with no Babylonian mathematical texts.
Historians have no idea what was going on mathematically in this
period. But in the Seleucid period about 300 B.C., Babylonian math¬
ematics picks up again in nearly the same form in which it had existed
before the gap (Seidenberg, 1978, p. 310). At the very least, this shows
that our knowledge of the past is extremely fragmentary.
Seidenberg tends to stress the ideas that great discoveries are
made only once and that the appearance of similar ideas in widely
separated cultures implies cultural diffusion. It may well be that many
important ideas were transmitted in this way. Arbitrary details, which
could easily have been expressed differently, may be a particularly
reliable sign of cultural diffusion. Thus there may be many ways of
approximating V2, but when the same method appears in two differ¬
ent places, cultural diffusion can be reasonably inferred.
At the same time, there is evidence indicating that independent
invention may have played an important role in past scientific devel¬
opments. For example, the story of the mathematician Madhava, who
lived in India in the fourteenth century, provides an illustration of
repeated scientific achievement. We normally associate the use of
power series to compute trigonometric functions with the develop¬
ment of calculus in Europe, starting with Newton and Leibniz. How¬
ever, Madhava is credited with inventing the power series expansion
for the arc tangent function, which was independently discovered in
Europe by James Gregory in 1671 (Amma, 1979, pp. 182-83). Since
Madhava lived in a traditional Indian cultural milieu, such mathemati¬
cal creativity could, in principle, have arisen in India at any time over
a period of thousands of years.
We should also note that the Indian mathematician Srinivasa
Ramanujan had a very poor education in mathematics. But entirely on
his own, he made mathematical discoveries that astonished the best
mathematicians of Europe. Such a person could easily have lived many
centuries ago in India or in other civilized societies. His work might
well have been used in pioneering scientific studies that did not find
their way into standard texts intended for students or ritualistic priests.
Thus it is possible that an advanced science of mathematics existed
somewhere in the world prior to 1700 B.C. This may have involved
sophisticated applications that went far beyond elementary texts, such
as Sulvasutras, intended for simple applications. There is no need here



A10. Planetary Diameters in the Surya-siddhanta 285
to postulate “secret knowledge.” Advanced knowledge, by its very
nature, would have been known only to a small elite, and it could easily
have become lost in the course of time.
If advanced mathematics existed, it would have provided the basis
for advanced quantitative science. This ties in consistently with the
evidence for sophisticated astronomy and earth measurement that we
have discussed in this study.
A10. Planetary Diameters
In the Surya-siddhanta
The Indian astronomical text Surya-siddhanta gives a rule for
computing the angular diameters of the planets. By combining these
angular diameters with the circumferences of the planetary orbits
listed in this text, it is possible to compute the diameters of the planets
(Thompson, 1997). When these computations are carried out, the
results agree surprisingly well with modern astronomical data. In this
appendix, we discuss several possible explanations for this and hypoth¬
esize that the angular diameter rule in the Surya-siddhanta may be
based on advanced astronomical knowledge that was developed in
ancient times but has now been largely forgotten.
A10.1 ANGULAR DIAMETERS OF PLANETS
In chapter 7 of the Surya-siddhanta (Burgess, 1860), the thirteenth
verse gives the following rule for calculating the apparent diameters of
the planets Mars, Saturn, Mercury, Jupiter, and Venus:
7.13. The diameters upon the moon’s orbit of Mars, Saturn, Mercury,
and Jupiter, are declared to be thirty, increased successively by half the
half; that of Venus is sixty.
The meaning is as follows: The diameters are measured in a unit of
distance called the yojana, which in the Surya-siddhanta is about five
miles. The phrase “upon the moon’s orbit” means that the planets look



286 A10. Planetary Diameters in the Surya-siddhanta
from our vantage point as though they were globes of the indicated
diameters situated at the distance of the moon. (Our vantage point is
ideally the center of the earth.) Half the half of thirty is 7.5. Thus the
verse says that the diameters “upon the moon’s orbit” of the indicated
planets are given by 30, 37.5, 45, 52.5, and 60 yojanas, respectively.
The next verse uses this information to compute the angular
diameters of the planets. This computation takes into account the
variable distance of the planets from the earth, but for the purposes of
this discussion it is enough to consider the angular diameters at mean
planetary distances. The Surya-siddhanta lists mean planetary dis¬
tances from the earth, and the diameters upon the moon’s orbit were
given for the planets at these distances.
The Surya-siddhanta says that there are fifteen yojanas per minute
of arc at the distance of the moon (giving 324,000 yojanas as the cir¬
cumference of the moon’s orbit). Thus the mean angular diameters of
the planets in minutes can be computed by dividing the diameters upon
the moon’s orbit by fifteen. These figures are listed in the following
table, and three other estimates of planetary angular diameters are
included for comparison.

Venus 4.0 3.25 3.13 6.300 0.159 1.050
These are the angular diameters measured by the Danish astrono¬
mer Tycho Brahe, those reported by the second-century Alexandrian
astronomer Claudius Ptolemy in his book Planetary Hypotheses, those
given by the Indian astronomer Aryabhata in his Aryabhatiya, and



A10.1 Angular Diameters of Planets 287
those measured recently by modern astronomers. The modern mini¬
mum and maximum angular diameters correspond to the greatest and
least distances of the planets from the earth.
The Surya-siddhdnta angular diameters are roughly the same size
as those reported by Claudius Ptolemy. Ptolemy attributed his angular
diameters to the Greek astronomer Hipparchus, but he did not say
how they were measured. According to the historian of astronomy
Noel Swerdlow, no earlier reports of planetary angular diameters are
known, and Ptolemy’s angular diameters were reproduced without
change by later Greco-Roman, Islamic, and European astronomers up
until the rise of modern astronomy in the days of Galileo, Kepler, and
Tycho Brahe (Swerdlow, 1968).
Brahe’s figures were obtained by sighting through calibrated pin¬
holes by the naked eye. They are very similar to Ptolemy’s, and they are
clearly much larger than the angular diameters measured in more recent
times by means of telescopes. It is well known that a small, distant light
source looks larger to the naked eye than it really is. This phenomenon
makes it likely that angular diameters of planets would inevitably have
been overestimated by astronomers before the age of the telescope.
It is noteworthy that Brahe’s angular diameters are the closest to
modern values, and they are high by 298% to 2750%. It is evident that
naked eye measurements do not disclose the actual angular sizes of
planets, even roughly. They simply measure a blob of planetary light
generated by the poor optics of the human eye.
It has been argued that Indian astronomy was heavily influenced
by Hellenistic astronomy between the second and fifth centuries A.D.
(Pingree, 1976). This suggests that the angular diameters given in the
Surya-siddhdnta may have been based on Ptolemy’s angular diam¬
eters. Indeed, Ptolemy’s figures are very close to 94/(60 - 7.5i), where
i+1 is the line number in Table A10.1. The corresponding Surya
siddhdnta figures are given by (30 + 7.5i)/15, and Aryabhata’s are given
by 6.3/(6 - i) (Clark, 1930, pp. 13-15).
Whether or not this indicates an Indian adaptation of Greek mate¬
rial, the angular diameters from Surya-siddhdnta have an important
property that the Ptolemaic angular diameters lack. To see this, it is
first necessary to examine the sizes of the mean planetary orbits, as
given in Surya-siddhdnta.



288 A10. Planetary Diameters in the Surya-siddhanta
A10.2 PLANETARY ORBITS
IN SURYA-SIDDHANTA
Verses 12.85-90 of Surya-siddhanta give the circumferences of the
planetary orbits in yojanas. These figures are reproduced in Table
A10.2, accompanied by orbital radii computed using five miles/yojana.

Jupiter 51,376,000 40,884,000
Saturn 127,668,000 101,595,000
The circumferences of the Surya-siddhanta orbits are propor¬
tional to the mean orbital periods of the planets. For Mercury and
Venus, the mean planetary position is the same as the position of the
sun, and thus the orbital circumferences in the table are the same for
Mercury, Venus, and the sun. For Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, the mean
position corresponds to the average motion of the planet in its helio¬
centric orbit.
Verse 1.59 of the Surya-siddhanta gives the diameter of the earth
as 1,600 yojanas. Several scholars have argued that the yojana in the
Surya-siddhanta is about 5 miles, thereby bringing the earth’s diameter
to the realistic value of 5x1,600 = 8,000 miles. Examples are Sarma
(1956), Burgess (1860), and Dikshit (1969b).
Different standards were adopted for the yojana by different
medieval Indian astronomers. This was noted by the astronomer
Paramesvara (A.D. 1380-1450), who said that “What is given by
Aryabhata as the measure of the earth and the distances [of the Planets



A10.3 Diameters of the Planets 289
from it], etc., is given as more than one and a half times by other
[astronomers]; this is due to the difference in the measure of the yojana
[adopted by them]” (Sarma, 1956, p. 83).
We discuss different yojana lengths in Section 4.5. These include
a short yojana for which the diameter of the earth comes to 1,728 =
16x108 yojanas—a number related to the Krta-yuga length of 1,728,000
years. Since there are 1,600 Surya-siddhdnta yojanas in the diameter of
the earth, the Surya-siddhdnta yojana must be longer by a factor of
exactly 1.08.
Verse 4.1 of the Surya-siddhdnta gives the diameters of the sun and
moon as 6,500 and 480 yojanas, respectively. Given 5 miles per yojana,
the resulting lunar diameter of 5x480 = 2,400 miles is about 11 % higher
than the modern value. The corresponding earth-moon distance of
about 258,000 miles is high by 8.3%. However, the sun’s diameter
comes to 5x6,500 = 32,500 miles, which is far too small.
It is easy to see why the diameter of the moon should be reasonably
accurate. The dimensions of the moon and its orbit were well known
in ancient times. For example, the lunar diameter given by Ptolemy in
his Planetary Hypotheses falls within about 7% of the modern value, if
we convert his earth-diameters into miles using the modern diameter
of the earth (Swerdlow, 1968).
It is also easy to see why the diameter for the sun is too small.
Ancient astronomers tended to greatly underestimate the earth-sun
distance, and the table shows that this also happened in the Surya
siddhdnta. The angular diameter of the sun is easily seen to be about
the same as that of the moon—about x/2 degree. This angular diameter,
combined with a small earth-sun distance, leads inevitably to a small
estimate for the diameter of the sun. Ptolemy’s solar diameter figure
is similar to the Surya-siddhdnta s.
A10.3 DIAMETERS OF THE PLANETS
What about the planets? Ptolemy listed wildly inaccurate diam¬
eters for Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn in his Planetary
Hypotheses. To see what the Surya-siddhdnta says about the diameters
of these planets, we should multiply the Surya-siddhdnta orbital radii
by the Surya-siddhdnta angular diameters (converted to radians). The
results are listed in miles in the Table A10.3. The error percentages



290 A10. Planetary Diameters in the Surya-siddhanta
compare the Surya-siddhanta diameters with the corresponding mod¬
ern planetary diameters.
Note that even though the angular diameters are too large, and the
orbital radii are too small, the calculated diameters are close to modern
values for Mercury, Mars, and Saturn..
TABLE A10.3

Mercury 3,032 3,008 -1
Venus 7,523 4,011 -47
Mars 4,218 3,772 -11
Jupiter 88,748 41,624 -53
Saturn 74,580 73,882 -1
For Venus and Jupiter, they are too small by about 50%. One
explanation is that radii were given for Venus and Jupiter, rather than
diameters. On this hypothesis, Venus and Jupiter also agree well with
modern data. If we multiply these Surya-siddhanta diameters by two,
we get 83,248 miles for Jupiter and 8,022 miles for Venus. These figures
differ from the corresponding modern values by -6% and 7%. Given
this correction, all five planets have an error of 11% or less. (The root
mean-square error comes to 6.3%.)
It is striking that the error percentages in the table are either small
or close to 50%, but it may seem gratuitous to suppose that radii are
involved in the latter case. In order to get more insight into this, we
calculated the root-mean-square percentage of error between the
Surya-siddhanta diameters and the planetary diameters given by
modern astronomy. We also did the same calculations using the
angular diameter data of Ptolemy, Tycho Brahe, and the Indian
astronomer Aryabhata. The results are listed in Table A10.4.
The percent error under “Diameter” was computed on the as¬
sumption that a computed planetary size was a diameter. The percent
error under “Radius or Diameter” was computed on the assumption



A 10.3 Diameters of the Planets 291
that a radius or a diameter was assumed, with the one that fits best
being chosen. In this case, the choice for radius was made for Venus
and Jupiter in the Surya-siddhanta data.
We see that the error percentage goes down as expected when we
switch from the “diameter” hypothesis to the hypothesis of “radius or
diameter/’ For Surya-siddhanta it went down by a factor of 5 to 6.3%,
TABLE A10.4

Surya-siddhanta 32.0 6.3
Ptolemy 45.7 28.2
Tycho Brahe 43.4 24.8
Aryabhata 39.6 21.0
but the decrease was much less in the other cases. The question is, is this
unusual, or is it what we might expect by statistical fluctuation? To
check this, we introduce a statistical hypothesis as follows:
Since Tycho Brahe is known as an excellent naked-eye observer,
let us suppose that naked-eye angular diameter observations will
exhibit statistical scatter around mean values agreeing with Brahe. The
idea here is that someone making naked-eye observations of planets
would be likely to come close to Brahe’s values, but not likely to hit
them exactly. Given some random error centered on Brahe’s values,
how likely is it that the observations, combined with Surya-siddhanta
orbital data, will come close to the right planetary diameters?
For simplicity, we will assume that the naked-eye observations will
be uniformly distributed between Brahe minus a percentage of spread
and Brahe plus that percentage. Given this hypothesis, we compute the
probability that naked-eye angular diameter measurements, com¬
bined with Surya-siddhanta orbital data, give results better than those
obtained from the actual Surya-siddhanta angular diameters.
We say that the calculated diameters based on simulated naked
eye measurements are “better” if the root mean square of the
error percentages of calculated vs. real diameters is lower than the



292 A10. Planetary Diameters in the Surya-siddhanta
corresponding root mean square based on Surya-siddhanta verse 7.13.
The probability of doing better is computed by running 20,000 random
trials, picking angular diameters at random within that percentage of
spread. These probabilities are listed in Table A10.5.
Given our “diameter” hypothesis, the probability of doing better
than the Surya-siddhanta reaches 2% to 3%, assuming a large spread
in the naked-eye measurements. Given the “radius or diameter”

hypothesis, the probability of doing better never rises above 0.4%, no
matter what spread we assume. Our conclusion is that the correlations
between Surya-siddhanta calculations and modern planetary diam¬
eters might have come about by chance, but the chances are very small.
For comparison, we can likewise compute the probability of doing
better than Aryabhata’s planetary diameters. But in this case, we get
percentages as high as 14.2% under “Diameter” and 44.2% under
“Radius or Diameter.”
If the observed correlations did not arise by chance, then perhaps
they are due to design. One hypothesis is that at some time in the past,
ancient astronomers possessed realistic values for the diameters of the



A10.4 Alternative Explanations 293
planets. They might have acquired this knowledge during a forgotten
period in which astronomy reached a high level of sophistication. Later
on, much of this knowledge was lost, but fragmentary remnants were
preserved and eventually incorporated into texts such as the Surya
siddhdnta. In particular, the real diameters of the planets were later
combined with erroneous orbital circumferences to compute the
diameters “upon the moon” given in verse 7.13. These figures were
then accepted because they gave realistic values for the angular
diameters of the planets as seen by the naked eye.
With this hypothesis, we can go back to consider the fact that the
Surya-siddhdnta diameters of Jupiter and Venus are almost exactly
half of the corresponding modern diameters. One can argue that the
Surya-siddhdnta diameters for Jupiter and Venus were actually the
radii for these planets that were accepted as diameters by mistake. Or
radii might have been deliberately used instead of diameters in order
to allow for the simple rule of 30+7.5i used in verse 7.13. This is con¬
sistent with the fact that such verses were intended as memory aids and
brevity was considered to be a virtue.
A10.4 ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS
Let us review the steps taken thus far. Angular diameters for the
five planets, Mercury through Saturn, are given in the Surya-siddhdnta.
The Surya-siddhdnta orbital radii were computed from orbital circum¬
ferences listed in the text using the conversion factor of five miles per
yojana. This factor is based on the Surya-siddhdnta’s diameter for the
earth, and it is corroborated by the Surya-siddhdnta figures for the
moon’s diameter and the earth-moon distance. There is no scope for
juggling numbers here.
The only proposed adjustment of the numbers is the doubling of
the Surya-siddhdnta diameters of Jupiter and Venus. Since the Surya
siddhdnta numbers can be so easily brought into line with modern data,
it may be that they have a genuine relationship with this data.
One possible explanation is that verse 7.13 may have been written
recently, using modern planetary data, and falsely interpolated into
the text. But this is ruled out by the fact that there is a manuscript of
the Surya-siddhdnta that scholars date to the year 1431 A.D. (Shukla,
1957). This manuscript includes a commentary by Paramesvara, who



294 A10. Planetary Diameters in the Surya-siddhanta
died in 1450 A.D., and thus it definitely dates back to the fifteenth
century. Verse 7.13 is present in this manuscript, and it agrees with the
Burgess translation quoted above. The commentary explains the verse
point by point, and thus it confirms that the verse was present in the
manuscript in the same form in which it appears today.
In fifteenth-century Europe, the prevailing ideas concerning the
sizes of the planets came from medieval Islamic astronomers who were
following the teachings of Ptolemy. The first telescopic observations of
planets were made by Galileo in 1609-10 (Drake, 1976). As late as
1631, Pierre Gassendi of Paris was shocked when his telescopic obser¬
vation of a transit of Mercury across the sun revealed that its angular
diameter was much smaller than he had believed possible (Van
Helden, 1976). It is clear that the information on planetary diameters
in the Surya-siddhanta antedates the development of modern knowl¬
edge of these diameters.
It is also clear that Hellenistic astronomers did not have accurate
diameters for the planets. Ptolemy computed planetary diameters
from his angular diameters and his estimates of planetary distances,
and these were reproduced without significant change by European
and Islamic astronomers for centuries (Swerdlow, 1968). However, his
figures disagree strongly both with modern data and with the diam¬
eters computed from Surya-siddhanta.
A10.5 CONCLUSION
In summary, verses 7.13 and 12.85-90 of the Surya-siddhanta
contain information regarding the true diameters of the five planets
Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. This information enables
us to compute the diameters of three of these planets with errors of
11% or less. If the computed figures for Jupiter and Venus are
interpreted as their radii rather than their diameters, then these radii
are in error by about -6% and 7%, respectively. This may not be due
to mere coincidence. Rather, it may indicate that accurate knowledge
of planetary diameters was possessed by ancient astronomers and used
in the composition either of the Surya-siddhanta or of some earlier
astronomical text on which it was based. It is not apparent how such
knowledge may have been obtained, but we should be on the alert for
other possible examples.



All. The Cave Heavens 295
All. The Cave Heavens
There is a book entitled The Report Concerning the Cave Heavens
and Lands of Happiness in Famous Mountains, by Tu Kuang-t'ing,
who lived from A.D. 850 to 933. This book lists ten “cave heavens” and
thirty-six “small cave heavens” that were supposed to exist within
mountains in China. Here are the reported experiences of a man who
entered a passageway leading to one of these cave heavens:
After walking ten miles, he suddenly found himself in a beautiful land
with a clear blue sky, shining pinkish clouds, fragrant flowers, densely
growing willows, towers the color of cinnabar, pavilions of red jade, and
far flung palaces. He was met by a group of lovely, seductive women, who
brought him to a house of jasper and played him beautiful music while he
drank a ruby-red drink and a jade-colored juice. Just as he felt the urge
to let himself be seduced, he remembered his family and returned to the
passageway. Led by a strange light that danced before him, he walked
back through the cave to the outer world; but when he reached his home
village, he did not recognize anyone he saw, and when he arrived at his
house, he met his own descendants of nine generations hence. They told
him that one of their ancestors had disappeared into a cavern three
hundred years before and had never been seen again (Kafton-Minkel,
1989, p. 191).
The time dilation effect in this story suggests that we are dealing
with a parallel reality rather than an ordinary three-dimensional cave.
In European stories of the Fairy Folk, a standard theme is that if
someone returns to this world after living in the world of the Fairies for
a short time, then he will find that many years have passed.
The same theme occurs in Sanskrit literature. For example, the
Bhagavatam recounts the story of King Kakudmi and his daughter
Revati, who visited Brahma in Satyaloka. Even though they were there
for only an hour or so, when they returned they found that millions of
years had passed (Bhagavatam 9.3.28-32).
In the Bhagavatam, there is a description of a region called Bila
svarga, or the subterranean heaven, which is clearly related to the
Chinese story of the cave heavens. Bila-svarga is described as a very



296 A12. Spirit Paths in the Sky
beautiful place, with brilliantly decorated cities, lakes of clear water,
and extensive parks and gardens. At the same time, the sun and the
moon cannot be seen there, and the inhabitants have no sense of the
passing of time.
One of the seven levels of Bila-svarga is Atala, which is said to be
inhabited by three groups of women, called svairini, kamini, and
purhscali. If a man manages to visit this region,
these women immediately capture him and induce him to drink an
intoxicating beverage made with a drug known as hataka. This intoxicant
endows the man with great sexual prowess, of which the women take
advantage for enjoyment. A woman will enchant him with attractive
glances, intimate words, smiles of love and then embraces. In this way she
induces him to enjoy sex with her to her full satisfaction. Because of his
increased sexual power, the man thinks himself stronger than ten thou¬
sand elephants and considers himself most perfect. Indeed, illusioned
and intoxicated by false pride, he thinks himself God, ignoring impending
death (Bhdgavatam 5.24.16).
A12. Spirit Paths in the Sky
The Bhagavad-gita (8.26) states that “there are two ways of passing
from this world—one in light and one in darkness. When one passes in
light, he does not come back; but when one passes in darkness, he
returns.”
The path of darkness is called the pitr-ydna, or path of thepitrs (the
ancestral spirits). According to the Visnu Purana, on the north of the
star Agastya, and south of Ajavithi (the three naksatras Mula,
Purvasadha, and Uttarasadha), outside of the Vaisvanara path, lies the
road of the pitrs (Wilson, 1980, p. 327).
The naksatras Mula, Purvasadha, and Uttarasadha correspond to
parts of the constellations Scorpio and Sagittarius, and it is thought
that Agastya corresponds to the southern hemisphere star called Ca¬
nopus. According to Srldhara Swami’s commentary on the Bhdgavatam,
the path of Vaisvanara corresponds to the nine naksatras from Mula to
Revatl. (The last three are specifically called Vaisvanarl.) (Wilson,
1865, p. 268).



A12.1 The Path of Light 297
This puts Pitrloka, or the path to it, south of the ecliptic, starting
with the region of Scorpio and Sagittarius. From the latitude of India
in the northern hemisphere, the stars on the path of the pitrs tend to rise
only briefly above the horizon, and thus they were associated with
darkness and the underworld.
According to the Visnu Purana, in this region
There dwell the great Rsis, the offerers of oblations with fire, rever¬
encing the Vedas, after whose injunctions creation commenced . .. for as
the worlds are destroyed and renewed, they institute new rules of
conduct, and reestablish the interrupted ritual of the Vedas.
Mutually descending from one another, progenitor springing from
descendant, and descendant from progenitor, in the alternating succession
of births, they repeatedly appear in different houses and races ... residing
to the south of the solar orb as long as the moon and stars endure (Wilson,
1980, p. 328).
These Rsis are connected with the family, the ancestors, and the
return of the soul to a new family situation in the cycle of birth and
death. But on the northern path, the path of light, the soul is said to
attain an eternal destination and does not return.
A 12.1 THE PATH OF LIGHT
The path of light is followed by perfected yogis and mystics, and it
is also known as deva-yana, the path of the demigods. The Visnu
Purana states that the path of the demigods lies to the north of the orbit
of the sun (the ecliptic), north of Nagavithi (the naksatras Asvini,
Bharanl, and Krttika), and south of the stars of the seven rsis.
The three naksatras, Asvini, Bharanl, and Krttika, which define
the southern border of the'path of the demigods, are located in parts
of the constellations Aries and Taurus. The seven rsis correspond to
the constellation Ursa Major, commonly known as the Big Dipper,
which is situated in the northern celestial hemisphere.
After reaching the seven rsis, the soul enters the path of Visnu,
called Visnupada. This extends north from the seven rsis to the pole
star, called Dhruvaloka.
In many ancient cultures, the stars which rise and set are associated
with the temporary things of this world, which repeat in cycles. In



298 A12. Spirit Paths in the Sky
contrast, the stars that endlessly circle the polestar and do not set
symbolize eternity. This is also true in Indian cosmology. There the
region of the circumpolar stars is regarded as Visnu Paramam Padam
the feet of the Supreme Being, Visnu, who controls time while remain¬
ing outside of time.
This is that excellent place of Vishnu to which those repair in whom
all sources of pain are extinct in consequence of the cessation of ... piety
or iniquity, and where they never sorrow more. There abide Dharma,
Dhruva and other spectators of the world, radiant with the superhuman
faculties of Vishnu, acquired through yoga; and there, fastened and in
woven, too, are all that is and all that shall ever be, animate or inanimate
(Wilson, 1865, pp. 270-71).
It is noteworthy that at the latitude of New Delhi, all but one of the
stars of the Big Dipper now set beneath the horizon in the course of a
day and night. However, in about 2500 B.C., when Thuban was the
polestar, the seven stars of the Big Dipper never set. Before Polaris
reached the pole within the last thousand years, the last good polestar
was Thuban, about 2000 to 3000 B.C. So it may be that the traditions
about the paths of the Devas and of Visnu date back to this period.
A12.2 CELESTIAL PATHS IN MANY CULTURES
The Milky Way plays a role in both the pitr-yana and deva-yana
paths. It is seen in the sky as a somewhat irregular band of light and con¬
centrated stars extending in a great circle that tends to run north and
south, cutting the celestial equator at an angle of roughly 62°. A very
bright region of the Milky Way intersects the ecliptic in the constella¬
tion Sagittarius near the naksatras Mula and Purvasadha. This is the
beginning of the path of the pitrs. At the diametrically opposite point,
the Milky Way intersects the ecliptic at the boundary of the constella¬
tions Taurus and Gemini, near the beginning of the path of the Devas.
Once we are able to locate the pitr-yana and deva-yana paths on
the celestial sphere, we can ask whether or not similar accounts of the
celestial travels of the soul might be present in other cultural traditions.
It turns out that many cultures around the world regard the ecliptic and
the Milky Way as pathways for transmigrating souls. Here are some
examples;



A12.2 Celestial Paths in Many Cultures 299
1. In China there are traditional stories about a monkey named Sun
who gets involved in various remarkable adventures. In one story,
two “harpooners of death” capture him, claiming he has reached the
limit of his destiny on the earth, and is due to be taken to the
underworld. The story’s translator notes that according to the
Chinese, it is the constellation Nan Teou, the Southern Dipper, that
decides everybody’s death, and the orders are executed by these
“harpooners of death” (Wou, 1957, p. iii, and Schlegel, 1875, pp.
172ff).
The Chinese Southern Dipper consists of six stars in the constel¬
lation Sagittarius (Mu, Lambda, Phi, Sigma, Tau, and Zeta Sagittarii)
(Wou, 1957). It is interesting to note that this constellation shares
stars with Purvasadha and Uttarasadha, two of the naksatras mark
•• •• * •
ing the beginning of the path of the pitrs, according to the Visnu
Purana. Thus the beginning to the route to the headquarters of
Yamaraja corresponds in this Chinese tradition to the place in the
heavens where the fate of the dead is decided. In addition, the
Chinese tradition has messengers of death that are similar to the
Yamadutas, the messengers of Yamaraja.
2. The German scholar Franz Boll has analyzed ancient Greek tradi¬
tions regarding Hades, the river Styx, and the ferryman of the
underworld. We tend to think of Hades as lying beneath our feet,
within the earth. However, Boll cites texts placing this region in the
heavens around the southern crossroads of the Milky Way and the
ecliptic, between Scorpius and Sagittarius (Boll, 1903, pp. 246-51).
3. Boll points out a close relationship between Greek and Babylonian
traditions. According to his analysis, the Babylonian god Dikud, the
judge of Hades, may correspond to the star. Theta Ophiuchi. This
star lies just to the north of the naksatra Mula in the constellation
Scorpius, and thus it is close to the beginning of the pitr-yana path.
A text cited by Boll refers to this star as “the beginning of the road
of the lower heavenly vault” (Boll, 1903).
4. In North America the Pawnee and Cherokees say that “the souls of
the dead are received by a star at the northern end of the Milky Way,
where it bifurcates. He [God] directs the warriors on the dim and
difficult arm, and women and those who die of old age upon the
brighter and easier path. The souls journey southwards; at the end
of the celestial path they are received by the Spirit Star” (Hagar,



300 A12. Spirit Paths in the Sky
1906, p. 363, and Alexander, 1916, p. 117). The anthropologist S.
Hagar thinks the Spirit Star is Antares. Antares is Alpha Scorpionis
in the constellation Scorpius, and it corresponds to the naksatra
Jyestha. Jyestha is next to Muia, at the beginning of the path of the
pitrs.
5. The Roman writer, Macrobius, in his Commentary on the Dream of
Scipio 1.12.1-8, says that souls of the dead ascend by way of
Capricorn, and to be reborn, descend again through the gate of
Cancer. He has shifted everything by one sign of the zodiac; Capri¬
corn is next to Sagittarius, and Cancer is next to Gemini. In fact, he
says in 1.12.5 of his Commentary that the gate of Cancer is at the
intersection of the zodiac and the Milky Way (Stahl, 1952).
6. In Honduras and Nicaragua the Sumo say that their “Mother
Scorpion ... is regarded as dwelling at the end of the Milky Way,
where she receives the souls of the dead, and from her, represented
as a mother with many breasts, at which children take suck, come the
souls of the new-born” (Alexander, 1920, p. 185). Here the “Mother
Scorpion” is reminiscent of the constellation Scorpius. We note that
the tail of the constellation Scorpius corresponds to the naksatra
Mula.
7. In general, Polynesians have traditionally believed in reincarnation,
and they have maintained that the Milky Way is the pathway of
transmigrating souls. The Mangaians of the Austral Islands in
Polynesia claim, in particular, that souls can enter heaven only on
evenings of solstices (north islanders at one solstice and south
islanders at the other) (Gill, 1876, pp. 156ff, 185ff). The important
point here is that the solstices occur when the sun is in the constel¬
lations Sagittarius or Gemini, near the intersection between the
Milky Way and the ecliptic. At sunset during a solstice these
constellations would therefore be at the islanders’ horizon.
The specific details that repeatedly appear in these stories suggest
the existence of a common cultural tradition. The differences between
the stories, and the lack of clear historical records of their origin,
suggest that this common cultural source dates from the remote past
(see Section 5.2).



A13. Arjuna and Ulupi 301
A13. Arjuna and Ulupi
The theme of mystical travel into a parallel world is illustrated by
a story in the Mahabharata involving the Pandava hero Arjuna. The
story began when Arjuna was exiled for twelve months because of
having intruded accidentally on his brother Yudhisthira and their
common wife, Draupadl. Arjuna, known also as the son of KuntI, went
to visit Haridvara along the Ganges River in the Himalayas. There he
began to participate in sacrificial rites with a number of sages.
While the son of Kunti resided there among the brdhmanas, O
Bharata, the sages brought to fruition many agni-hotras, the offering to
the sacred fire. As the fires on both banks of the river were roused and
brought to blaze, the offerings poured, and flowers offered in worship by
learned, self-controlled sages, duly consecrated and fixed as great souls
on the spiritual path, then, O king, the gateway of the Ganges shone with
exceeding splendor.
When his residence was thus crowded with divinity, the darling son
of Pandu and Kunti then went down into the Ganges water, to be
consecrated for holy rite. Taking his ritual bath and worshiping his
forefathers, Arjuna, happy to take his part in the rite of fire, was rising out
of the water, O king, when he was pulled back in by Ulupi, the virgin
daughter of the serpent king, who could travel about at her will and was
now within those waters. Holding onto him, she pulled him down into the
land of the Nagas, into her father’s house.
Ulupi then proposed to Arjuna, arguing that she felt extreme
desire for him and therefore he should be merciful and satisfy her.
Arjuna did this in accordance with the code of the ksatriyas, the Vedic
warrior class. Thus, “The fiery hero Arjuna spent the night in the
palace of the Naga king, and when the sun rose he too rose up from
Kauravya’s abode.”
Kauravya is the name of the Naga king. Note that when Ulupi
pulled Arjuna down, instead of finding himself on a rocky or sandy
river bottom, he found himself in the Naga kingdom. This is an
example of mystic travel, and in this case the travelers entered in¬
to a parallel or higher-dimensional world. The Nagas are a race of
intelligent beings that are said to live either in the subterranean worlds
called Bila-svarga, or in parallel domains on the surface of the earth.



302 A14. Madhvdcarya’s Visit to Vyasadeva
A14. Madhvacarya’s
Visit to Vyasadeva
Madhvacarya (1238-1317) was a major Indian religious reformer
and the founder of an important school of Vaisnavism. He introduced
the philosophy of Dvaita, which maintains that there is an absolute
distinction between the individual soul and God, and he stressed the
worship of Krsna as the Supreme God.
It is said that Madhvacarya directly met Vedavyasa, the compiler
of the Vedas. The story of this meeting is pertinent to this cosmological
study, because Vedavyasa is said to be living in a place called Uttara
badarikasrama, which is not accessible to ordinary human beings.
Badarikasrama in the Himalayas is a famous place of pilgrimage vis¬
ited by thousands of people every year. But Uttara (or “northern”)
Badarikasrama illustrates how higher, parallel realities enter into
traditional geographic thinking in India.
The story is recorded in Narayana Panditacarya’s Sumadhva Vi
jaya, a biography of Madhvacarya dating to the fourteenth century.
Madhvacarya was visiting Badarikasrama with his disciples, and he
decided to depart alone for Uttara-badarikasrama. One of the dis¬
ciples, named Satyatlrtha, tried to follow him:
The monk Satyatlrtha .. . followed him not being able to bear the
separation from Madhvacarya.
Satyatlrtha could not reach Madhvacarya when the sun was becom¬
ing red (sunset) by running behind him, as the latter had got onto the path
difficult to be crossed by others. Madhvacarya was jumping easily in
speed over the distant stones having no resting place between one an¬
other (Rau, 1983, p. 74).
Madhvacarya was apparently flying over the Himalayan peaks in
the manner of Hanuman’s famous flight to Lanka. In fact, Madhvacarya
is compared with Hanuman (Anjaneya), and like Hanuman, he is
regarded as an incarnation of Vayu, the god of wind:
This famous Madhvacarya, who is going on the peak of the Himalayas
(the best of mountains) and who has a name that destroys sins (of the



A15. The Story of Duhkhi Krsna Ddsa
y j • • • • 303
devotees) shone like Anjaneya (the best of apes) who has speed like
the wind and like Bhimasena who causes fear to the demons (Rau. 1983,
p. 74).
One way to look at this is that Madhvacarya was simply jumping
over a mountain into an inaccessible valley. However, the description
of northern Badarikasrama suggests that it is more than simply a
remote valley that could be reached by mountaineers:
Madhvacarya saw that Badarikasrama which is like Vaikuntha. It is
filled with groups of flowers and sages. It fulfills the desires of the minds
of the virtuous who are devoted to the (supreme) independent Lord. It
is inaccessible to those devoid of knowledge and devotion. It contains
people having no hatred for one another. It is the abode of Lord
Vedavyasa (Rau, 1983, p. 78).
This Vedavyasa, having sweet speech, wandered long in this world
for the protection of knowledge, of those possessing knowledge, and of
the things that are the subject of knowledge.
The respectable Vedavyasa now living in this Badarikasrama gave up
the sight of the people for the working of the Kali age like the sun giving
up the sky for the working of the night (Rau, 1983, pp. 81-82).
In short, Uttara-badarikasrama is actually part of a higher world,
even though it is ostensibly part of this world. This is the way the Bhd
gavatam describes Jambudvlpa: Jambudvipa represents this world,
but at the same time it represents a heavenly realm with divinely
qualified inhabitants who are not of this world.
A15. The Story of
Duhkhi Krsna Dasa
• •• •
There are many stories in Vaisnava literature which involve
communication between this world and a higher, parallel realm. In this
example, a sixteenth-century Vaisnava saint named Duhkhi Krsnadasa
was performing the daily service of sweeping the sacred area of Seva
kunja in Vrndavana, a famous pilgrimage place in India (Rosen, 1991).



304 A15. The Story of Duhkhi Krsna Dasa

Painting by Julia
Wilson.
While doing this one day, he found a golden anklet that seemed to
emanate a remarkable aura. Impressed by the influence that it had on
his consciousness, he considered it to be very important, and he buried
it in a secret place.
Shortly thereafter an old lady came to him, asking for the anklet and
saying that it belonged to her daughter-in-law. Because of its spiritual
influence, Duhkhi Krsnadasa was convinced that the anklet must
really belong to RadharanI, the eternal consort of Krsna. After a long
discussion, the old lady finally admitted that this was so, and revealed
that her true identity was Lalita-sundarl, one of Radharanf s servants.
At this point, Duhkhi Krsnadasa wanted to see his visitor in her
true form, but she said he would be unable to bear such a revelation.
After being convinced of his sincere desire, however, she finally
acquiesced to his request and revealed her true, incomparable beauty.
After giving him several benedictions and receiving the anklet from
him, she disappeared, and he was unable to find where she had gone.
One of the benedictions given to Duhkhi Krsnadasa was a special
tilaka mark on his forehead, and a new name, Syamananda. Since
Lalita had sworn him to secrecy about their meeting, it was difficult for
Syamananda to explain the tilaka and new name to his guru, who
thought that he had simply concocted them. In the course of dealing
with this difficult situation, Syamananda again met Lalita-sundarl.
This time, however, he met her by entering into her transcendental
realm in a state of meditation.



A16. History of Precession 305
This story illustrates the idea of an inhabited parallel reality which
is not normally visible or accessible to ordinary people. It is interesting
that one can enter this reality by a process of meditation, so that it
seems to be related to the mind or consciousness. At the same time,
objects and people can pass in solid form from that reality into this one.
A16. History of Precession
Precession of the equinoxes is said to have been discovered by the
Greek astronomer Hipparchus in the second century B.C. He gave it
a value of 1° per century of Egyptian, 365-day years. According to Otto
Neugebauer, this was an upper estimate, his real estimate being 1° in
77 Egyptian years (Neugebauer, 1975, p. 298).
Theon, writing in the second century A.D., held that the equinox
“trepidates” back and forth in a zigzag at a rate of 1° in 80 years. In
contrast, modern astronomy teaches that precession proceeds uni¬
formly through a complete 360° cycle.
The medieval Indian astronomy text Surya-siddhdnta maintains
that the equinoxes trepidate back and forth 600 times in a divya-yuga
of 4,320,000 years. This yields a period of 7,200 years per cycle
(Burgess, 1860, p. 114). The complete cycle covers 108° in four equal
legs going east, west, west, east by 27°. The rate of precession in the
Surya-siddhanta comes to 54 arcseconds/year (which equals 108/2) or
66.67 years per degree. These numbers clearly seem to be adjusted to
the ideal number 108.
Most medieval Indian astronomers either ignored precession or
accepted a theory of trepidation. However, Munjal is cited by
Bhaskaracarya as saying that there are 199,669 revolutions of the
equinoxes in a kalpa of 4,320,000,000 years (Dikshit, 1969b, p. 211).
This gives a precessional rate of about 60 years per degree or 1 year per
arcminute, and a full cycle is close to 21,600 years.
According to modern astronomy, the rate of precession of the
equinoxes in A.D. 2000 is 50.3878 arcseconds/year (Green, 1985,
p. 211). At this rate, a full cycle comes to 25,720.5 years at 71.4459 years
per degree. However, the rate of precession is known to change slowly
with the passage of time.



306 A17. Van der Waerden’s Argument
A popular definition of precession allots 2,160 years for the
equinoxes to pass through one sign of the zodiac, so that one cycle of
precession comes to 25,920 years. This approximation assumes 72
years per degree. The Egyptologist Jane Sellers has argued that the
precessional cycle of 25,920 years was known in the ancient Near East
(Sellers, 1992). This suggests that the “years” of the cycle may be of 360
days, so that it requires 70.96 sidereal years per degree. In either case,
this estimate of the rate of precession is much more accurate than any
of the other premodern rates mentioned above.
A16.1 NOTE ON ARYABHATA
According to the Surya-siddhanta’s theory of trepidation, the
cycle of precession was at its center point (neither east nor west) at the
beginning of Kali-yuga. According to many Jyotisa Sastras, Kali-yuga
began in 3102 B.C. The trepidation returns to its center point after 3600
years, which comes to A.D. 499. So the Surya-siddhanta is saying that
the position of the equinoxes was the same in 3102 B.C. and in A.D. 499.
The latter date falls in the life of Aryabhata, who is the first of the
known authors of Jyotisa texts. Aryabhata wrote that he was 23 years
old when sixty 60-year cycles had elapsed in Kali-yuga (Dikshit, 1969b,
p. 55), and this was in A.D. 499. It would be interesting to know why the
Surya-siddhanta’s theory of precession happens to make the sky look
the same in Aryabhata’s lifetime as it was at the accepted beginning of
Kali-yuga.
A17. Van der Waerden’s Argument
As evidence that 3102 B.C. was calculated using Jupiter-Saturn
conjunctions, B. L. van der Waerden noted that, according to Alberuni,
certain Chaldeans and inhabitants of Babel assigned the deluge to
3351 B.C. (van der Waerden, 1980, p. 124). Alberuni also said that
“astrologers” specified that a conjunction had occurred 229 years and
108 days before the deluge.
By adding 229 years to 3351 B.C., we can estimate that 478 years



A18. The Yuga System in America 307
separated the astrologers’ conjunction from 3102 B.C. This is almost
exactly 24 small conjunctions or two middle conjunctions. This sug¬
gests that these astrologers were working with planetary parameters
indicating a Jupiter-Saturn conjunction in 3102 B.C. But evidently they
didn’t think the deluge occurred at this time.
We can imagine that, later on, astrologers jumped forward two
middle conjunctions to 3102 B.C. When they realized that other
planetary conjunctions occurred at this date, they decided that this
was when the deluge really happened. This is van der Waerden’s idea.
But one could just as well argue that Alberuni’s astrologers already
knew about 3102 B.C. but rejected it. Their 3351 B.C. flood date shows
that they didn’t think the deluge should fall on a Jupiter-Saturn
conjunction.
There were evidently differences in opinion among the astrolo¬
gers. The Islamic writer Mashallah put the deluge in 3301 B.C. (van der
Waerden, 1980, p. 124). This is ten small conjunctions before 3102 B.C.
But Mashallah, writing in the ninth century or later, probably knew
about 3102 B.C. and rejected it for some reason.
According to van der Waerden, Alberuni’s Chaldean and Babylo¬
nian astrologers were living in the Hellenistic period. But all we really
know about them is that they came before Alberuni, who wrote in the
tenth century. For all we know, their knowledge of the 3102 B.C. date
may have come from India, and it may even have come from Aryabhata,
who was active around A.D. 500.
A18. The Yuga System in America
According to the Puranas, the bull of Dharma, or religious prin¬
ciples, begins with four legs in Krta-yuga. (See the Bhdgavatam verses
1.17.24-25.) In each successive yuga the bull loses one leg and virtue
decreases, until finally it totters on one leg in Kali-yuga and corruption
becomes rampant.
A striking parallel to this story is told by the Sioux Indians of North
America, who also have a cyclic chronology of four ages. The anthro¬
pologist Joseph Epes Brown writes,



308 A19. On the History of Astronomy
According to Siouan mythology, it is believed that at the beginning of
the cycle a buffalo was placed at the west in order to hold back the waters.
Every year this buffalo loses one hair, and every age he loses one leg.
When all his hair and all four legs are gone, then the waters rush in once
again, and the cycle comes to an end. .. .
It is believed by both the American Indian and the Hindu that at the
present time the buffalo or bull is on his last leg, and he is very nearly bald.
Corresponding beliefs could be cited from many other traditions (Epes
Brown, 1971, p. 9).
An interesting feature of these parallel accounts is that both apply
the sequence 4:3:2:1 to the four ages (by counting legs).
A19. On the History of Astronomy
In the course of this study we have repeatedly encountered evi¬
dence suggesting that the history of science has not been one of linear
progress. In this appendix we will briefly outline some evidence indi¬
cating a decline in astronomical knowledge between roughly 2500 B.C.
and the rise of scientific Babylonian astronomy late in the first millen¬
nium B.C.
We begin by considering the great pyramid. This remarkable
structure was built around 2500 B.C. out of some 2.5 million limestone
blocks, weighing an average of 2.6 tons apiece. Many fantastic things
have been written about the great pyramid, but the sober facts are even
more remarkable in their implications.
The perimeter of the great pyramid was accurately measured at
921.455 meters by the engineer J. H. Cole, using modern surveying
methods (Stecchini, 1971, p. 364), and its height is about 146.73 meters
(Krupp, 1983, p. 101). If we divide the perimeter by the height, the ratio
is about 2 times 3.14. Thus the angular pyramid imitates a sphere,
where the circumference divided by the radius is 2 times k.
If we divide the surface area of the pyramid (assuming it to be a
regular geometric figure) by the area of its base, we get 1.6195, which
is close to the golden mean (1.618), a famous ratio in the history of art
and architecture. This relationship was known to the Greek historian
Herodotus (485-425 B.C.), who commented that the surface area of



A 19.1 Egyptian Astronomy 309
one face of the great pyramid equals its height squared (Stecchini,
1971, p. 370). This is mathematically equivalent to saying that the ratio
of surface area to base area is the golden mean.
By a kind of mathematical coincidence, the n relationship and the
golden mean relationship cannot both be exactly true, but if one is
nearly true, the other will also be nearly true. Could either one have
been built into the great pyramid intentionally? Quite possibly both
were intended, but this would imply a knowledge of n and the golden
mean in 2500 B.C.
To add to the mystery, John Legon observed that the three Giza
pyramids fit precisely in a rectangle, aligned to the cardinal directions,
with an east-west side of 1414 cubits and a north-south side of 1732
cubits (Bauval, 1994, p. 54). These lengths come to a thousand times
the square roots of two and three, respectively. The hypotenuse of this
rectangle is a thousand times the square root of five, which is related
to the golden mean. If this is not coincidental, it implies both an interest
in mathematics and a unified plan for the construction of all three
pyramids.
The eminent historian of science Otto Neugebauer commented,
on the basis of surviving texts, that Egyptian mathematics “never rose
above a very primitive level” (Neugebauer, 1945, p. 4). This may be a
proper conclusion from texts such as the Rhind papyrus, dating to
Egypt’s sixteenth dynasty. But it is not borne out by the Giza pyramids
of the fourth dynasty.
Actually, even the surviving texts give hints of sophisticated
knowledge. B. L. van der Waerden has pointed out that the Moscow
papyrus (c. 2050-1800 B.C.) gives the correct formula for the volume
of a truncated pyramid—which hardly seems primitive. (Homework
problem: Derive this formula using primitive methods, and don’t
look up the answer in advance.) He noted that the ancient Chinese
also have this formula, but the ancient Babylonian texts do not men¬
tion it. So he assumed a pre-Babylonian common source (van der
Waerden, 1983, p. 44).
A19.1 EGYPTIAN ASTRONOMY
Neugebauer declared that, “It is a serious mistake to try to invest
Egyptian mathematical or astronomical documents with the false



310 A19. On the History of Astronomy
glory of scientific achievements or to assume a still unknown science,
secret or lost, not found in extant texts” (Neugebauer, 1945, p. 8).
Nonetheless, the layout of the great pyramid betrays a level of astro¬
nomical achievement not reflected in extant texts.
In his scientific survey of the great pyramid, J. H. Cole found that
the average length of the four sides of the pyramid was 230.364 meters.
The four sides (W, N, E, and S) deviate from this average by only -0.7,
-11.1,2.7, and 9 centimeters, respectively (Stecchini, 1971, p. 366). The
four sides were accurately aligned with the cardinal directions with an
average discrepancy of about three minutes of arc in any direction
(Bauval and Gilbert, 1994, p. 38).
The alignment with the cardinal directions implies that astronomi¬
cal sighting was used to determine true north. In Appendix 10, we note
that the angular diameters of the planets, as measured by Tycho Brahe
using refined naked-eye techniques, range from 1.57 to 3.13 arcminutes.
These values represent blurring in the human eye and are much larger
than the true angular diameters of the planets. This indicates that the
position of a star or planet probably cannot be measured with an
average error less than about 1.5 minutes. To appreciate this, try
looking at a quarter at a distance of 200 feet. At this distance, it has an
angular diameter of 1.43 minutes.
At least two star measurements are needed to determine true
north, resulting in a composite error of about 1.4 times the error in one
measurement. After this, many additional error-prone steps are needed
to construct a six-million-ton pyramid.
The archaeoastronomer E. C. Krupp commented on the Egyptian
achievement as follows: “Accuracy of this sort is possible, even with
very simple techniques, provided that care is taken in setting out the
lines. Preserving this accuracy on the monumental scale of the Great
Pyramid, however, means not ‘twisting’ the sides at higher levels, and
the Egyptian’s success is impressive” (Krupp, 1983, p. 102). Indeed, an
accuracy of 3 arcminutes must lie at the very limit of what can be
achieved by simple techniques—if it does not exceed that limit.
The latitude of the great pyramid is noteworthy. This is 29° 58' 51",
very close to 30°. A former Astronomer Royal of Scotland observed
that if the designers of the great pyramid intended the north pole to
appear to be at an elevation of 30° at the pyramid’s site, then due



A19.2 Babylonian Astronomy 311
to atmospheric refraction, they should have placed it at a latitude of
29° 58' 22" (Hancock, 1996, p. 40). This off by only 29 arcseconds. (For
additional evidence of ancient, accurate latitude measurements, see
Section 4.5 and Appendix 8).
Within the great pyramid there are four famous shafts that extend
north and south through the mass of the building, starting from the
“King’s” chamber and the “Queen’s” chamber. It has been shown that
in the period of about 2500 B.C., these four shafts were aimed at four
prominent stars at their points of culmination (the highest point
reached by a star during the day). This is summed up in the following
table (Hancock, 1996, p. 65):
TABLE A19
Star Alignments in the Great Pyramid
Chamber Shaft Angle Star
Queen’s northern 39° Kochab (Beta Ursa Minor)
Queen’s southern 39° 30' Sirius (Alpha Canis Major)
King’s northern 32° 28' Thuban (polestar)
King’s southern 45° 14’ A1 Nitak (lowest in Orion's belt)
Here “angle” is the angle of elevation of the shaft from horizontal.
According to the SkyGlobe astronomy program, the declination of
Thuban in 2500 B.C. was 88° 13'. This means that the star would have
culminated at 31° 47', quite close to the angle of the northern King’s
chamber shaft. Similar statements can be made about the other stars.
We note that, even if the angle to a star at culmination was measured
quite accurately, to accurately build a shaft for many meters through
the pyramid at this angle would have been a very difficult task.
A19.2 BABYLONIAN ASTRONOMY
Now let us turn to the history of Babylonian astronomy. In about
the seventh century B.C., the Babylonian scribes of Enuma Anu Enlil
began a program of systematic astronomical observation, aimed at



312 A19. On the History of Astronomy
predicting astronomical phenomena (such as heliacal risings of plan¬
ets) for purposes of divination and magic (Swerdlow, 1998). By the
third to first centuries B.C., they developed sophisticated computa¬
tional procedures that were used to generate ephemeris tables, listing
predicted dates of phenomena.
The archaeoastronomer N. M. Swerdlow argues that “The Scribes
great science of the heavens is as close to the origin of science, and of
the methods and practices of science, as we shall ever come” (Swerdlow,
1998, p. 33). Based on his extensive analysis of Babylonian astronomi¬
cal tablets, he is convinced that the scientific method of collecting
observational data and fitting mathematical rules to it was created by
the Babylonian priest-astronomers.
Swerdlow emphasizes that the strong point of Babylonian as¬
tronomy was its prediction of phenomena in time. He points out,
however, that the Babylonians were very limited in their ability to
mathematically denote positions of celestial bodies in space and to
observe or predict such positions. They also did not use geometric
models in the manner of the Greek astronomers. Indeed, their ap¬
proach was arithmetical, rather than geometrical, and Swerdlow is
convinced that even the division of a circle into 360° was “a Greek
geometrical adaptation of a Babylonian arithmetical convention”
(Swerdlow, 1998, p. 35).
Positions of planets in the sky were defined, at best, in terms of the
twelve signs of the zodiac. Thus, the Babylonian astronomers “had no
reliable method of finding longitude more precisely than by zodiacal
sign, or by beginning and end of zodiacal sign, as reported in the
Diaries, meaning in both cases nothing more precise than location in
the vicinity of particular stars of irregular zodiacal constellations”
(Swerdlow, 1998, p. 72).
From Swerdlow’s analysis, we can be reasonably sure that as¬
tronomy of the Babylonian type (along with nascent Greek efforts)
represents the high point of Western astronomical knowledge in the
period from the seventh to the first centuries B.C. But is it correct to
assume that this marked the beginning of scientific astronomy? If we
assume a linear model of scientific progress, then this must be so. But
the evidence we have been considering indicates that progress may
have its ups and downs.
Consider the evidence of accurate astronomical measurements



A19.3 Lost Knowledge? 313
built into the structure of the great pyramid. The measurements in¬
volved are orders of magnitude better than crude estimates in terms
of roughly defined zodiacal signs. The pyramid builders must have
made use of some kind of numerical notation for angles, since to build
a shaft at a prescribed angle, it is necessary to record the angle and
then reproduce it later on with some kind of instrument. After all,
the measurement of a star’s culmination could be made only at cer¬
tain times at night, while construction activity presumably went on
during the day. (Note that the angle and time of culmination define a
coordinate system for star positions.)
It follows that there must have been a decline in standards of astro¬
nomical position measurement between 2500 B.C. in Egypt and 700
B.C. in Mesopotamia. This is not to say that the Babylonians of the first
millennium B.C. did not create an ingenious system of empirical astro¬
nomy. But others came before them and surpassed them, at least in the
matter of position measurements.
Swerdlow comments that, “interestingly, the observations from
the third to second centuries are not more accurate than those from the
seventh century” (Swerdlow, 1998, p. 81). Possibly, the Babylonians
saw their low standard of position measurement as adequate for
purposes of divination, and therefore they made no real effort to find
improved techniques of measurement.
A19.3 LOST KNOWLEDGE?
Lack of documentation for ancient advanced science cannot be
used to conclude that such science never existed. Swerdlow points out
that in Babylon, “the astronomical texts were restricted to, indeed,
intelligible to, a very small circle of scholars and were in no sense
‘published’ works” (Swerdlow, 1998, p. 28). The Babylonian astro¬
nomical tablets are evidently survivals from the workshop of a small
group of researchers. It is surprising that they survived, and it would
not be at all surprising if they had been lost.
An example of the nonsurvival of ancient technical documenta¬
tion is provided by the story of the Antikythera computer. An ad¬
vanced astronomical computer, based on an intricate system of gear
wheels, was discovered in a shipwreck off the coast of the Greek island
of Antikythera. The ship was loaded with statues and other objects of



314 A19. On the History of Astronomy
art, and it sank in about 65 B.C. The computer was first recovered from
the wreck as a shapeless lump that split open to reveal a set of brass
plates. Careful study revealed a mechanism made of at least twenty
gear wheels, including differential gears and a crown wheel. It appears
to have been a computing machine that could exhibit on a series of dials
the motions of the sun, moon, and planets.
The principles behind the computer’s design remain unknown. No
surviving literature refers to such machines, but surely this example
could not have been unique. It must correspond to a well-developed
system of astronomy and a well-developed technology for producing
geared machines. Both seem to have disappeared without a trace, and
the Antikythera find itself was purely accidental. If it were not for this
chance discovery, we would remain completely ignorant of the exist¬
ence of such machines.
A19.4 DARK AGES
In the case of the Antikythera computer, the great decline in
knowledge that occurred with the fall of the Roman Empire may have
been more than sufficient to wipe out nearly all traces of the science
behind its construction. Of course, we can easily imagine knowledge
being lost even without a period of social disruption. But it is nonethe¬
less interesting that a “dark age” apparently prevailed well after the
time of the great pyramid and just before the rise of Babylonian
astronomy.
Peter James has assembled evidence for coordinated dark ages in
Mediterranean and Near Eastern civilizations in roughly the first
quarter of the first millennium B.C. (James, 1991). His thesis is that this
period represents a gap in chronology that should be filled in by re¬
ducing the age of everything before 1000 B.C.
The more general view of his data is that the gap is a real period,
in which civilized life was greatly disrupted. In Greece, the gap is the
famous Greek Dark Age, spanning roughly 1200 to 700 B.C. (James,
1991, pp. 68-94). Vincent Desborough, an expert on this period, wrote
that when it began,
The craftsmen and artists seem to vanish almost without a trace: there
is very little new stone construction of any sort, far less any massive



A19.5 Parallels in India 315
edifices; the metal-worker’s technique reverts to the primitive and the
potter, except in the early stages, loses his purpose and inspiration; and
the art of writing is forgotten. But the outstanding feature is that by the
end of the twelfth century the population appears to have dwindled to
about one-tenth of what it had been little over a century before (James,
1991, p. 72).
The corresponding dark age in the Near East appears to have been
particularly severe. Thus no Babylonian buildings date with certainty
between 1046-722 B.C. (James, 1991, p. 280). Fewer than sixty texts
from Babylon date to 1000-750 B.C., even though there were some
12,000 from the previous 500-year Kassite period. According to John
Brinkman, a leading authority on the post-Kassite period, “Babylonian
history during the first quarter of the first millennium B.C. may be
characterized as a period of obscurity or ‘dark age’, with the land
frequently overrun by foreign invaders and with the central govern¬
ment often unable to assert its jurisdiction in many areas” (James,
1991, p. 279).
A strange feature of Babylonian prehistory is that there are rec¬
ords of quite sophisticated Babylonian mathematics dating to about
1700 B.C. Records of similar mathematics appear in roughly 300 B.C.,
but in the intervening period of some 1300 years there are no math¬
ematical texts from Babylonia (Seidenberg, 1978, p. 310). Since the
mathematical tradition was somehow kept alive, this simply shows
how easy it is for records of scientific knowledge to disappear.
The record suggests that the Babylonians began their program of
systematic astronomical research shortly after the end of their dark
age. One may ask: Did this represent a fresh start in a new era of
optimism, after a period of cultural decline? Whether this is so or not,
the rise of Greek and Babylonian astronomy set the standard of an¬
cient science until the time of the Renaissance at the end of the post
Roman dark age.
A19.5 PARALLELS IN INDIA
In India there is a parallel to the dark age of the first millennium
B.C., but in this case the period of apparent cultural decline seems to
have been much longer. Based on radiocarbon dating, the mature



316 A19. On the History of Astronomy
phase of the Harappan, or Indus Valley, civilization extended from
about 2600 to 1900 B.C., and the late phase persisted for a couple
hundred years after 1900 B.C. (Lai, 1998, p. 114). This is called the first
South Asian urbanization.
According to anthropologist Jim Shaffer, many scholars accept
that the period between 1900 and 700 B.C. was marked by the disap¬
pearance of cultural traits such as “large-scale public architecture,
writing, a system of weights, and the many other material artifacts that
are used to characterize the Indus Valley civilization” (Shaffer, 1993,
pp. 53-54). This was followed by a second urbanization that took place
in the Ganges Valley beginning about 700 B.C. and continues to the
present. Some authorities have argued that a clean cultural break
separates the two urban periods. However, Shaffer emphasizes that
there is substantial evidence for continuity of a single Indo-Gangetic
cultural tradition bridging the gap.
Indus Valley sites such as Harappa and Mohenjo-daro are famous
for advanced city planning and for realistic sculpture reminiscent of
the classical Greeks. Stone weights have been recovered from Mohenjo
daro, and archeologist A. S. Hemmy remarked that their low ratio of
scatter to mean weight may indicate a stricter regulation of commerce
than in other countries of that era (Hemmy, 1938, p. 603).
Harappan society seems to have been advanced and well-orga¬
nized. But, unfortunately, the Harappan script has not been success¬
fully deciphered, and we do not even know what language the people
spoke. We have very little knowledge of their intellectual life.
In the period of the second urbanization, astronomical develop¬
ments in India appear to have paralleled those of Babylon and Greece,
either through direct cultural borrowing or through parallel creation
inspired by the diffusion of ideas. The early phase of communication
with Mesopotamia may be represented by the Jyotisaveddriga, which
is dated by David Pingree to the fourth or fifth century B.C., mainly on
linguistic grounds (Pingree, 1973, pp. 3-4). The later Jyotisa Sdstras
may represent a phase in which indigenous developments were influ¬
enced by ideas introduced from Greek as well as from Babylonian
astronomy.
In Indian astronomy and in Indian culture in general, the idea is
always prominent that knowledge dates back to a very remote era.
Thus the sixth-century astronomer Aryabhata wrote, “This work,



A19.5 Parallels in India 317
Aryabhatiya by name, is the same as the ancient Svayambhuva (which
was revealed by Svayambhu) and as such it is true for all time” (Kak,
1987, p. 216). At the same time, he said that “By the grace of Brahma
the precious sunken jewel of true knowledge has been brought up by
me from the ocean of true and false knowledge by means of the boat
of my own intellect” (van der Waerden 1983, p. 213). Taken together,
these statements suggest that Aryabhata saw himself as reconstructing
ancient truth from fragments of knowledge that were available to him.
We have seen that Indian astronomical and cosmological works
may contain precessional references pointing back to periods much
earlier than those accepted for the texts in question (see Sections 3.2
and 8.2). We have also seen evidence of advanced astronomical knowl¬
edge in the Surya-siddhdnta and in the Bhagavatam (see Appendix 10
and Section 4.4). A hypothesis to explain this is that advanced astro¬
nomical knowledge may have existed in India in the period of the first
Indian urbanization. At this time, as in later eras, there was diffusion
of knowledge and inspiration along trade routes linking East and
West. Thus there may have existed an international scientific elite
pursuing similar ideas in countries ranging from India to Egypt during
this period. Subsequently, knowledge declined throughout this area in
a period of darkness, only to increase again after about 700 B.C. At
present, of course, this hypothesis is very tentative and much addi¬
tional research is needed to give it a solid foundation.

Glossary
Angular diameter—the angle subtended by a planet’s disk, as seen by an
observer on the earth. The angular diameter in radians times the planet’s
distance gives the planet’s diameter.

of the Brahmanda, literally “inner space.”
Aryabhata—famous Indian astronomer who was born in A.D. 476 and
whose Aryabhatiya described the earth as rotating on its axis.
Astrolabe—an astronomical instrument with the stereographic projec¬
tions of the earth, some stars, and the ecliptic on a series of metal plates.
Astronomical unit—the mean distance from the earth to the sun, about 93
million miles. Distances in the solar system are often expressed as mul¬
tiples of this unit.
Bhaskaracarya—medieval Indian astronomer who wrote the Jyotisa Sastra
known as Siddhdnta-siromani.

Bhdgavatam.
Bhagavatam—same as Bhagavata Purana.
Brahe, Tycho (1546-1601)—Danish astronomer known for his accurate
naked-eye observations and planetary measurements. He considered that
the sun revolved about the earth while the other planets revolved about the
sun.
Brahmanda—literally Brahma egg, one of the innumerable universes,
described in the Puranas. It consists of a spherical shell bisected by an
earth-disk, Bhu-mandala, of the same radius, with a region of space above
and a watery region below.
Bharata-varsa—southernmost of the nine subdivisions (varsas) of Jambu
dvipa, said to refer either to India or to the earth as a whole.
331



332 Glossary
Bhu-mandala—the earth-disk bisecting the sphere of the Brahmanda, the
Puranic universe. Its central region consists of seven alternating ring
shaped oceans and islands (dvipas), known as Sapta-dvlpa.
Bode-Titius law—a simple rule giving the distances of the planets from the
sun. It was first written down by Titius of Wittenburg, and it was discovered
independently by Bode in 1772. It is expressed by the formula D(n) = .4 +
.3 x 2n where D(n) is the distance of planet n in astronomical units and n =
-infinity for Mercury, 0 for Venus, 1 for earth, 2 for Mars, 3 for the asteroids,
4 for Jupiter, 5 for Saturn, etc.
Brahma, Lord—the creator in the Hindu trinity of Brahma, Visnu, and Siva,
traditionally seen as the original disseminator of the Vedas in human society,
after his enlightenment by Visnu from within.
Cakras—seven centers of psychic energy arrayed along the spine that are
awakened in the practice of yoga. These can be seen as analogous to the
seven worlds (lokas) from Bhu-mandala (base of spine) to Satyaloka
(crown of head).
Canopus—a star in the southern celestial hemisphere that is sometimes
identified as the southern polestar (although it is not very close to the
southern pole). In Puranic texts it is called Agastya.
Celestial equator—the projection of the earth’s equator onto the celestial
sphere. It is perpendicular to the earth ’s spin axis, which passes through the
center of the earth and the north and south poles.
Celestial north—If the earth’s grid of latitude and longitude is projected
onto the celestial sphere, it defines a direction of north on the sphere. The
northernmost point is the north celestial pole, corresponding to the earth’s
north pole.
Celestial south—If the earth’s grid of latitude and longitude is projected
onto the celestial sphere, it defines a direction of south on the sphere. The
southernmost point is the south celestial pole, corresponding to the earth’s
south pole.
Celestial sphere—an imaginary sphere much larger in diameter than the
earth and centered on the earth’s center. The stars and planets can be
thought of as points projected onto ihe surface of this sphere. Positions on
the celestial sphere are measured by celestial longitude, called right
ascension, and celestial latitude, called declination. See diagram on right.
Copernicus, Nicolaus (1473-1543)—the Polish astronomer famous for
introducing the heliocentric (sun-centered) theory of planetary motion.



Glossary y 333
Dhruvaloka—the spiritual abode of King Dhruva which is said to situated
at the north celestial pole.
Dvipa—island.
Ecliptic—the geocentric or¬
bit of the sun projected onto
the celestial sphere as a great
circle. This great circle is
tilted at an angle of about
23.5° to the celestial equator.
It intersects the celestial
equator at two points, known
as the vernal and autumnal
equinoxes, as shown on right.
Ephemeris—a table of plan¬
etary positions at successive
times.
Equinox—one of the two points on the celestial sphere where the ecliptic
intersects the equator, known as vernal and autumnal equinoxes. In one
year, the sun travels around the ecliptic, traveling counterclockwise as seen
looking down from the north. At the vernal equinox the sun cuts the
celestial equator going from south to north, and at the autumnal equinox
it cuts the celestial equator going from north to south, as shown above. The
length of the day equals the length of the night at the equinoxes.
Galileo Galilei (1564-1642)—Italian astronomer who accepted the helio¬
centric model and first used the telescope for astronomical observations.
Geocentric orbit of a planet—From the viewpoint of a person standing on
the earth, the sun moves around the earth and a planet orbits the sun. This
is shown for Mercury in Figure 4.9 (p. 96). The combination of the sun’s
motion around the earth and the planet’s motion around the sun forms the
apparent orbit of the planet around the earth. This is called the planet's
geocentric orbit. It lies between two curves: the inner boundary curve (A)
and the outer boundary curve (B).
Geographical north—north as defined by the grid of latitude and longitude
on the earth globe. Note that the Bhdgavatam uses a completely different
system of cardinal directions (north, south, east, and west) in Bhu-mandala,
centered on Mount Meru.
Geographical south—south as defined by the grid of latitude and longitude
on the earth globe.



334 Glossary
Great circle—any circle on the surface of a sphere that is centered on the
sphere’s center. All other circles on a sphere are smaller than a great circle.
Hasta—Indian cubit. Key hasta lengths discussed in this study are 432 mm
and 460.7 mm.
Hipparchus—a Greek astronomer who lived about 150 B.C. and who is
commonly thought to have discovered precession of the equinoxes.
Indra—the ruler of the heavenly region in Hinduism.
Jambudvipa—central island (dvipa) of Bhu-mandala having a central
mountain (Meru) and nine subdivisions (varsas).
Jyotisa Sastras—medieval Indian astronomy texts which contain instruc¬
tions for calculating planetary motions and solar and lunar eclipses. Surya
siddhanta is a text of this type.
Kali-yuga—the age of quarrel and degradation in the Puranic system of
cyclic time. There are four cyclically repeating yugas, Satya (Krta), Treta,
Dvapara, and Kali, with lengths proportional to 4:3:2:1. Kali-yuga is said to
last 1,200 divine years, which comes to 432,000 solar years. The major
Jyotisa Sastras all assume that Kali-yuga began on February 18,3102 B.C.,
as measured by the Julian calendar. They assume a mean alignment of the
planets on this date (see pp. 212-223).
Kepler, Johannes (1571-1630)—an astronomer famous for acceptance of
the heliocentric (sun-centered) model of the solar system and for his laws
of planetary motion.
Ketu—an invisible planet positioned at the descending node of the moon.
Krosa—an Indian unit of length, one quarter the length of a yojana.
Krsna, Lord—the original transcendental Supreme Lord, as described in
the Bhagavata Purana and Bhagavad-gitd.
Lokaloka Mountain—circular mountain dividing the inner, illuminated
region of Bhu-mandala from the dark, uninhabited, outer region, called
Aloka-varsa, which extends from Lokaloka to the shell of the Brahmanda.
Lunar nodes—the point where the orbit of the moon on the celestial sphere
crosses the sun’s orbit going north is called the ascending node, and the
opposite point is called the descending node. (See diagram on right.)
Mahabharata—an epic of some 100,000 verses, said to be an encyclopedia
of traditional Indian lore.



Glossary 335
Manasottara Mountain—circular mountain in the center of Puskaradvipa
which is traversed by the wheel of the sun’s chariot.
Meridian—any great circle of the earth passing through the poles.
Meru, Mount—the central mountain of Jambudvipa. It is shaped like an
inverted cone, with the city of demigods, Brahmapuri on top, and it
represents the cosmic axis. Also called Sumeru.
Naksatras—27 or 28 star constellations, situated roughly along the ecliptic,
which play a role in Indian astronomy similar to that of the 12 constellations
of the zodiac in the west. They are particularly connected with the motion
of the moon, which completes one sidereal orbit in about 27.3 days.
The naksatra constellations are irregular in shape, but the naksatras are
also defined to be angular subdivisions of the ecliptic.
See Appendix 1 (pp. 247-50) for more information.
Planisphere—a plane map of features on a sphere, produced by stereo¬
graphic projection.
Polestar—a star located near the celestial north pole—the center of daily
rotation of the heavens, as seen from the northern hemisphere of the earth.
Precession of the equinoxes causes such a star to be displaced. At present,
there is a polestar, called Polaris or Alpha Ursa Minoris. In about 2,500
B.C., Thuban or Alpha Draconis was the polestar. But during most of the
intervening period, there was no readily visible star at the north pole.



336 Glossary
Precession ofthe equinoxes—the slow shift of the equinoxes relative to the
fixed stars. Astronomers attribute this motion to the gradual rotation of
the earth’s spin axis like a spinning top. This slow rotation takes a “great
year” of about 25,700 years to complete one revolution, or about 71.4 years
per degree.
\%
Ptolemy, Claudius—second-century Alexandrian astronomer known for
his geocentric (earth-centered) epicyclic models for the motion of the
planets. These were widely accepted until the heliocentric (sun-centered)
theory was introduced by Copernicus in the sixteenth-century.
Puranas—Sanskrit texts from India dealing with ten topics, including the
creation and annihilation of the universe, the history of humans and
demigods, cosmology, and the relation between the soul and God. The
word “purana” designates ancient lore.
Sapta-dvipa—the central region of Bhu-mandala consisting of seven (sapta)
alternating ring-shaped oceans and islands (dvipas).
Sapta-rsi—the Big Dipper constellation, literally the “seven sages.”
Sidereal month—the time for the moon to make one orbit relative to the
stars (27.32166 days).
Sidereal zodiac—The zodiac is defined to be a division of the ecliptic into
12 equal “signs,” named in ancient times after particular constellations. If
the starting point of these signs is fixed relative to a star, the zodiac is said
to be sidereal. The Surya-siddhanta uses a sidereal zodiac in which the
beginning of the first sign (Mesa or Aries) is 10' beyond the ecliptic
longitude of the star Revati (Zeta Piscium). See tropical zodiac.
Siddhanfa-siromani—a Jyotisa Sastra, written by the medieval Indian
astronomer Bhaskaracarya, which maps the seven oceans and dvipas into
bands of equal latitude around the earth globe.
r,
Siva, Lord—the destroyer in the Hindu trinity of Brahma, Visnu, and Siva,
often pictured in meditation on Lord Visnu.
Solstice—As the sun travels around the ecliptic in its yearly course, it
reaches its northernmost point 90° after the vernal equinox. This is called
the summer solstice, and it is the time of the longest day in the northern
hemisphere. The sun reaches its southernmost point 90° after the autumnal
equinox. This is the winter solstice, the time of the shortest day in the
northern hemisphere. See ecliptic for diagram.



Glossary 337
Srimad-Bhagavatam—same as Bhdgavata Parana.
Stereographic projection—a method of mapping the surface of a globe onto
a plane. One form of stereographic projection is defined as follows (see
Figure 3.2, p. 48): Assume that we have a sphere and a plane tangent to the
north pole of the sphere. Given a point on the surface of a sphere, extend a
straight line from the south pole of the sphere through this point, until it
intersects the plane. The point on the sphere is mapped to this point.
One advantage of stereographic projection is that any great circle on the
sphere is mapped onto a circle in the plane.
Surya-siddhanta—a Sanskrit astronomical text (Jyotisa Sastra) presenting
an epicyclic theory of planetary motion . It also discusses the Indian system
of world chronology known as the yuga system, the periodic motions of the
sun, moon, and planets, distances from the earth to the sun, the moon, and
the planets, rules for calculating the times of solar and lunar eclipses, and
cosmology and geography.
Synodic month—the time for the faster-moving moon to lap the sun in its
orbit around the celestial sphere (assuming mean motions for the sun and
moon). This is the time from one new moon, when the moon and sun are
conjoined, to the next new moon, and it is 29.53059 days.
Tropical zodiac—The zodiac is defined to be a division of the ecliptic into
12 equal “signs”, named in ancient times after particular constellations. If
the starting point of these signs in the beginning of Aries is fixed relative
to the vernal equinox, the zodiac is said to be tropical. Due to precession
of the equinoxes, the tropical zodiac shifts slowly in relation to the sidereal
zodiac. In Western countries, the tropical zodiac has been in use since the
days of Hellenistic astronomy. The Indian sidereal zodiac (as defined in
Surya-siddhanta) agreed with the tropical zodiac in A.D. 564.
Turning point—The four turning points of a planet’s geocentric orbit are
defined as follows (see Figure 4.9, p. 96): The inner boundary curve (A) of
the planet’s geocentric orbit has a point of closest approach to the earth
(the perigee) and a point of greatest distance from the earth (perigee+).
The outer boundary curve (B) has a point of greatest distance from the
earth (the apogee) and a point of closest approach (apogee-). At each of
these four points, the boundary curve is tangent to a circle centered on the
earth.
Varsa—any one of the nine subdivisions of Jambudvipa, separated from
one another by mountain ranges.



338 Glossary
Vedas—ancient Sanskrit texts of revealed knowledge which are seen as
authoritative in Hindu religion.
Visnu, Lord—the transcendental Supreme Lord, described in the Bhagavata
Purana as an expansion of Lord Krsna. He is also known as the maintainer
in the Hindu trinity of Brahma, Visnu, ^nd Siva.
Visnu Purana—one of the eighteen major Puranas. It contains an exten¬
sive section on cosmology which complements the cosmological section of
the Bhdgavatam.
Yojana—an Indian unit of length, which is used to express distances in the
Bhdgavatam. Different standard yojana lengths have been used, including
one of about eight miles.

“Overturns a long history
of scholarly undervaluation
e " v/ ' ' "
of the supposedly ‘only
mythological’ contents of
Puranic literature.”
traditional spiritual texts seem wedded to
outmoded cosmologies that show, at best,
the scientific limitations of their authors.
The Bhagavata Purana, one of the classical
scriptures of Hinduism, seems, at first
glance, to be no exception. However, a
closer examination of this text reveals
unexpected depths of knowledge in
ancient cosmology. Alyster/'es of the Sacred
Universe shows that the cosmology of the
Bhagavata Purana is a sophisticated
system, with multiple levels of meaning
that encode at least four different
astronomical, geographical, and spiritual
world models.
By viewing the text in the light of
modern astronomy, Richard Thompson
shows how ancient scientists expressed
exact knowledge in apparently mythologi¬
cal terms. Comparison with the ancient
traditions of Egypt and the Near East
shows early cultural connections between
India and these regions—including a
surprisingly advanced science. However,
quantitative science is only part of the
picture. Mysteries of the Sacred Universe
also offers a clear understanding of how
the spiritual dimension was integrated
into ancient Indian cosmology.

University of Florida

RICHARD L.THOMPSON was born in Binghamton, New
York, in 1947. In 1974 he received his Ph. D. in mathematics from
Cornell University, where he specialized in probability theory and
statistical mechanics.
Dr.Thompson has done scientific research in quantum physics,
mathematical biology, and remote sensing. He has extensively
investigated ancient Indian astronomy, cosmology, and spirituality,
and has developed multimedia expositions on these topics. He is
the author of six books on subjects ranging from consciousness
to archeology and ancient astronomy.
