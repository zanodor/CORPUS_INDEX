of modern medicine, particularly in the treatment of chronic disease; fear of adverse side effects of prescription drugs, and the increasing support for the medicinal use of plants from modern clinical research. However, herbal medicine need not be an alternative to modern medicine. Indeed, most herbs are mild medicines that work well alongside prescription drugs. Despite media “hype,” true herb–drug interactions are few and these are clearly indicated, as appropriate, in this book. Although the treatment of chronic disease always requires professional advice, with minor health complaints there is a lot you can do for yourself using over-the-counter herbal preparations. The key to finding successful natural remedies is knowing what you are doing and why. This book provides the necessary guidance. Eating a healthy diet is fundamental to maintaining good health, but herbs have a special role to play when minor health problems arise.

The last decade has seen a rapid increase in the publication of books on herbal medicine. However, it is rare to find one, such as this, that incorporates details of over-the-counter remedies, written for the general public by a practicing herbal practitioner. Andrew Chevallier brings to this book years of experience in clinical practice and book authorship (he is the author of the Encyclopaedia of Medicinal Plantsalso published by Dorling kindersley). Andrew is a well-known and respected member of the herbal fraternity in the Uk, having been in the past President of the national Institute of Medical Herbalists. The origins of the use of herbs dates back to prehistoric times, and their traditional medicinal use continues in all cultural groups throughout the world. Many modern medicines were inspired by constituents found in traditional medicinal plants, and some modern drugs are still isolated from plant materials. However, the big difference between herbal and modern medicine is that while modern medicines comprise single chemicals, nature has endowed each herb with a spectrum of active components, which work synergistically to produce a healing effect that cannot be replicated from single components. Over the last twenty years there has been a resurgence of interest in the use of herbal medicine. There are several reasons for this, but the main ones are an increasing realization of the limits

Knowledge of medicinal plants often comes down to us from longstanding traditional use. Wild indigo root (Baptista tinctoria) was used by Native Americans to bathe cuts and treat rattlesnake bites.

Would a single herb product or a combination be most appropriate? Will it conflict with other medication you are taking? Answering these questions in detail is beyond the scope of any one book, but Herbal Remedies aims to provide you with the essential information to answer such questions, to choose safe and appropriate herbal remedies, and to put them to good use. Unlike synthetic medicines, herbal remedies are harvested from fields and forests all over the world. Their healing, therapeutic activity is simply one aspect of the plant world’s bountiful and generous relationship with animal life on our planet. With its many photographs and illustrations, this book reveals just a little of the beauty and variety to be found in medicinal plants, and encourages a greater awareness of the need to protect and conserve them in the wild. It is written in the hope that it will open up the world of herbal medicine for you and enable you to use herbal remedies to good effect.
Several hundred remedies, from arnica (Arnica montana) to withania (Withania somnifera), are now readily found in health food stores and pharmacies, while thousands are available on the Internet. The opportunities to find safe and effective herbal remedies for home treatment may never have been better. And whether they are taken to relieve common health problems, to prevent illness, or to enhance performance, herbal remedies—when used wisely—will work to improve health and vitality. While choice provides opportunity, it often comes with a sting in its tail! Walking down the aisles of a health food store, past row upon row of competing products, can be a bewildering experience. If you want a remedy for sinus congestion or period pains, how do you make your choice and decide what to buy? If you know that you want elderflower (Sambucus nigra) for sinus congestion, or white peony (Paeonia lactiflora) for period pains, many questions still arise. How do you know it will work? What type of preparation is best—tablet, tea, or tincture? Are there safety issues? What is good value for money?

What is herbal
medicine?



Why use herbal remedies?
When confronted by ill health, human beings have always sought medicines from the natural world, in particular from plants. Today, we have the opportunity to combine traditional knowledge of herbal medicine with the clarity that scientific research can provide.
strange as it may seem to us today, one reason why herbal medicines fell out of favor among doctors and scientists in the 19th and 20th centuries was because they were natural! While conventional medicines, such as aspirin, are mostly made up of single chemical compounds, herbal medicines may contain many hundreds of different constituents. as a consequence, it can be a daunting task for researchers to discover how an herb works and to identify the constituents responsible. No wonder it has been found much more straightforward to focus attention on single chemicals, which, if necessary, can be extracted and purified from medicinal plants. herbal medicines are also viewed with suspicion because they are prone to natural variation. different seasons
back to nature
produce slightly different crops. as one authority has put it, good quality in herbal medicine is not too different from good quality in wine. as in the case of grapevines, medicinal plants need to be tended with care, harvested at the right time, and processed appropriately to achieve the best results. even then, some crops will be better than others. The most serious complaint laid against herbal medicines, however, is that they can easily be adulterated. To most people, one pile of dried green leaves looks very much like another. if one is worth five times more than the other, the temptation will always be there to

“cut” the more valuable one, or to substitute a cheaper variety. in order to prevent poor-quality material from being sold and to guarantee safety, quality control is essential.
why use herbs?
if herbal medicines are so complicated and variable, why use them? some of the strengths of herbal medicines are listed below, and you will find examples of them throughout this book. • human beings have evolved alongside plants, using them as food and medicine. • herbal remedies are often dilute and can be adjusted to individual strength. • They usually work with the body’s own physiological processes. • When used sensibly, they have an enviable safety record. • medical research endorses a number of key herbal remedies where safety and effectiveness have been established. • Other remedies have longstanding traditional use as evidence of their efficacy. • They can be safely

minor acute and chronic conditions. • some remedies can be taken longterm in low doses. • many remedies can be taken to prevent illness or enhance performance. • as natural products, they are a permanently renewable resource. When grown organically, they can have a positive impact on the environment.
lavender
Herbal medicines such as lavender (Lavandula officinalis) are natural products and vary in quality in the same way as is found in wine.
Why use herbal remedies? 15



herbal health
this section looks at the broad picture of the way in which herbal remedies may be employed. For detailed advice on the self-treatment of particular problems, please refer to the Common health Problems section on pp.256–275.
herbal remedies can be safely used to: • treat common acute problems, for example coughs, headaches, and skin rashes. • treat chronic problems, for example mild depression, arthritis, and varicose veins. • Prevent illness. • enhance health. although they are natural, herbal remedies are medicines and can therefore cause side effects. For best results, they need to be used sensibly and with respect. they also need to be used with an awareness of what they cannot do!
minor acute problems herbal remedies are well suited to treating everyday health problems, though the standard caution about self, or home, treatment always applies: if you are in doubt, seek immediate professional advice, especially where unwell children are concerned. relief for conditions such as headache, sore throat, cough, gas, and bloating can occur quickly, although gradual, ongoing improvement in symptoms is more common with herbal medicine. Warm teas
and diluted tinctures can be particularly helpful. For simple problems, treatment for a few days will be sufficient. Skin problems such as minor burns, grazes, and rashes can be treated topically.
Example Symptoms of sore throat and hoarseness suggesting the start of a viral infection can be treated using remedies such as echinacea (Echinacea spp.), licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra), and sage (Salvia officinalis). take tea or diluted tincture of one or more of these remedies, first as a gargle, then swallow. Continue taking three times a day until symptoms have cleared. If symptoms deteriorate sharply or there is no improvement after five days, seek professional advice.
chronic problems
Problems that have lingered for months or even years, such as acid indigestion, osteoarthritis, and fungal skin infections, can be successfully relieved or improved with herbal remedies, although longterm treatment may be required (a rule of thumb used by herbal practitioners is one month’s treatment for every year the condition has been present). taking a remedy regularly is likely to prove more effective than occasional dosing when symptoms flare. that being said, there is nothing wrong in using herbal remedies for symptomatic relief.
Example acid
indigestion can be relieved (and hopefully reversed) by taking

Fresh sage (Salvia officinalis) leaves are antiseptic and can be rubbed on insect bites and stings.

meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) tea or tincture after meals for several months. Other remedies such as slippery elm (Ulmus fulva) and chamomile (Chamomilla recutita) may also prove helpful, as will attention to diet.
preventing illness taken long-term, many herbal remedies have been shown to have a potent ability to prevent illness or deterioration in existing symptoms. Indeed, some would argue that working on the basis that prevention is the best medicine is the way to use herbal remedies. the difficulty with a preventive approach of course is that, if successful, one does not see results. Such an approach nevertheless comes close to the ancient Chinese emperor’s practice of paying his doctors only as long as he remained well. as a result it was always in his doctors’ interest to act preventatively rather than once illness had taken hold.
Example millions of people take ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba) on a daily basis in order to maintain healthy blood flow to the brain and limbs and to prevent dementia, both uses that are strongly supported by clinical research. the herb’s notable antioxidant activity also helps prevent inflammation and allergy.
enhancing health
herbs can prove extremely helpful in promoting mental and physical performance, particularly where constitutional weaknesses exist. Whether taken by students studying for exams or athletes preparing for an event (who should remember that herbal remedies may test positive in drug testing), remedies with tonic and adaptogenic properties support endurance and the ability to cope with stress. night shift workers, people
Meadowsweet Meadowsweet tea or tincture is commonly taken to relieve digestive problems such as acidity, indigestion, and diarrhea.
putting in long hours or tolerating extreme conditions in the workplace, and those suffering from long-term stress may all benefit from such remedies.
Example For exams and interviews, mental focus and vitality can be enhanced with herbs such as rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) and schisandra (Schisandra chinensis)—but note that when taking these herbs it is important to try them out first, before the exam or interview. Similarly, people working long hours or nights can benefit from remedies such as Siberian ginseng
(Eleutherococcus senticosus) or golden root (Rhodiola rosea) to improve their stamina and work rate.
schisandra A Chinese tonic herb, schisandra is commonly taken to improve liver metabolism and enhance mental stamina and performance.

Are herbAl remedies sAfe?
With a few exceptions, all of the herbal remedies in this book are recognized as safe for home use. The few that are not, such as lobelia (Lobelia inflata), are commonly included in manufactured herbal products and are safe when taken as instructed.
All of the remedies listed have some evidence of effectiveness, although this varies greatly from plant to plant. The ability of ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba) to improve memory and prevent dementia is strongly supported by research evidence. On the other hand, the use of chickweed (Stellaria media) to soothe itchy skin and eczema has never been researched, and rests upon traditional knowledge and direct experience. The safety of herbal remedies, and their effectiveness as medicines, is not necessarily easy to establish. by and large, knowledge about how herbs work comes from: • Use as food or a food supplement. • Traditional knowledge of use as a medicine.
an ancient tradition
Effective herbal remedies such as licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) have been grown and used as medicines for thousands of years.
• The experience of herbal practitioners. • scientific research.
nutrition
remedies such as garlic (Allium sativum), lemon (Citrus limon), oats (Avena sativa), and soy (Glycine max) form a regular part of many people’s diets, and are therefore used as both food and medicine. long-term food use confirms that the remedy is safe to take as a medicine, although it tells one little about its effectiveness in this respect. some herbal remedies contain significant levels of nutrients and are taken as nutritional supplements, for example, kelp (Fucus vesiculosis). such use comes from scientific investigation of the plant’s constituents.
knowledge The strength of traditional medicinal systems such as Ayurvedic (india/sri lanka), Chinese, and Western herbal medicine lies in the fact that knowledge and experience of remedies has been built up over thousands of years, constituting what has been described as the longest-ever clinical trial. Put to the test of time, it is argued, few herbs that are harmful or ineffective will remain in popular

18



use—only those found to be safe and effective will retain their place. longstanding use of a herbal remedy can therefore be seen as a strong indicator of safety and usefulness, although it is not a guarantee.
experience
Trained herbal practitioners develop a practical, subtle understanding of how best to apply herbal medicines and are watchful for signs of side effects. They are able to select those remedies most likely to help a patient. The collective experience of herbal practitioners—for example, caution in giving devil’s claw (Harpagophytum procumbens) to patients with acid indigestion—can give important pointers to the safety and effectiveness of remedies.
research
scientific investigation into a medicinal plant spans a multitude of different types of research which add, like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle, to the overall picture. researchers can investigate: • The chemistry of the plant—its constituents and their actions. • The whole plant—parts used, actions, uses, safety issues, and so forth. • Processing—how to extract and process the remedy. • Clinical trials—the therapeutic use of a plant extract, including dosage levels, safety, and evidence of effectiveness. On one level, the chemistry of the plant, or phytochemistry, underpins all aspects of herbal research. if you know the key chemical constituents of a plant, you can make a reasonable guess about its level of safety and value as a medicine: caffeine is a key constituent in coffee (Coffea arabica), cola, guarana (Paulinia cupana), mate (Ilex paraguariensis), and tea (Camellia sinensis). its stimulant activity forms part of the action of each plant. Yet, each plant also has its own unique activity and character. The natural complex of constituents found
modern methods
Scientific research starts by analyzing the chemistry of the plant. Scientists can then investigate how key active components influence its medicinal activity.
within a herbal remedy—the “whole”is more than its key active constituents“the sum of its parts.” This interplay or synergy between different constituents is often a factor in the safety and effectiveness of an herbal medicine (see also Types of herbal remedy, pp.30–33). Good clinical trials compare the safety and efficacy of an herbal medicine against another medicine or a placebo (a dummy product). data collected from these trials provides the strongest evidence of just how safe or effective an herbal remedy is.
new use for cinnamon
The marriage between traditional knowledge and scientific research can lead to exciting new insights into the use of herbal remedies. Cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum) is a good example. While it is used in Asian traditional medicine for colds, flu, and digestive problems, recent investigations indicate that it has a potent stabilizing effect on blood sugar levels, helping to slow or prevent the onset of diabetes. It is also active against Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium commonly linked with stomach ulcers.

how remedies work
Around the world, people’s knowledge of how herbal medicines work varies widely. in many traditional societies, spirits are thought to be responsible for a plant’s activity, while in others the appearance and structure of a plant—its “signature”—indicates its use as a medicine.
AnimAl mAgic
observation of how animals use medicinal plants has undoubtedly been a key factor behind the traditional use of many plants, and is now itself the subject of scientific study. Around the world, animals from bears to snakes have been observed eating plants with specific medicinal activity only at those times when they are in need of them. Animals may also acquire a taste for plants that have general effects. The stimulant activity of coffee (Coffea arabica) was reputedly discovered after goatherds noted the frisky behavior of goats feeding on the bush’s red berries!
How plAnts work many people, including herbal practitioners, believe that medicinal

Bears are known to seek out and eat large quantities of antioxidant-rich roots and berries shortly before going into hibernation.
plants work in part on an energetic level, each plant having a distinct vitality, reflecting perhaps some kind of electromagnetic force. Understanding the vitality, or vital force, of a remedy gives clues that can be used to refine its use as a medicine, in particular helping to match specific remedies with the needs of individual patients. That being said, scientific research provides the greatest certainty that a remedy is safe to use and has a reasonable chance of being effective. scientific study of medicinal plants and their chemical constituents underpins our understanding of how herbal remedies work, and provides precise information on a plant’s therapeutic activity and potential use as a medicine.

active constituents
The main types of active constituent found in herbal remedies are listed below. Medicinal plants typically contain hundreds of different constituents with only a small proportion having direct therapeutic activity. As a rule, if you know a plant’s active constituents you can broadly predict its medicinal effects, for example linden flowers (Tilia spp.) contain a volatile oil with sedative activity, flavonoids, mucilage, and phenols. These constituents correlate with linden flower’s standard use as a remedy: to aid sleep and relaxation, relieve headache and fever, and lower blood pressure and support the circulation.

around the world
looked at from a global perspective, herbal medicine is humanity’s most important resource for treating and relieving illness. although conventional biochemical medicine provides the bulk of medical treatment in western countries, this is far from the case elsewhere.
In China and India in particular, traditional medicine is as popular as its conventional counterpart, and the vast majority of remedies used are herbal. In China, people choose whether to receive traditional or biochemical treatment, although in practice biochemical medicine is recommended for acute and life-threatening illness, and herbal medicine for chronic, long-term illness.
researching the herbs the sheer scale of traditional Chinese medicine means that research and development in China has brought new insights into herbal remedies. Clinical research in Shanghai into Chinese wormwood (Artemisia annua)—a
traditional Chinese remedy for malaria that grows in temperate regions around the world—led to the discovery that it was a highly effective treatment for malaria. the herb, and in particular its key active constituent, artemisinin, is at present the only certain treatment for severe malarial illness. In many parts of the world, particularly africa, the vast majority of medicines are herbal. In Ghana, over 80 percent of medicines used are herbal, most of which are prepared from native west african medicinal plants. Paralleling developments elsewhere in the world, moves are afoot to produce an african Pharmacopoeia that will provide scientific and medical data on 53 key african medicinal

plants, including remedies such as Withania somnifera.
even in western countries, a sizeable minority of medicines used are herbal. about 25 percent of the medicines used in the british national health Service are herbal in origin, while in Germany 90 percent of doctors routinely prescribe herbal medicines to their patients, hawthorn (Crataegus spp.) and saw palmetto (Serenoa serrulata) being common examples. Germany is a world center for research into herbal or phytomedicines, and German research from the 1940s onward has been responsible for establishing the safety and effectiveness of many popular over-the-counter remedies like ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba). worldwide, research into herbal medicines is expanding at an unprecedented rate. many countries have set up and support national research centers.

In the uS, herbal remedies are generally classified as food supplements and are marketed under regulations governing food rather than medicines.
herbal practitioners as herbal medicine has grown in popularity, so has the need for trained practitioners who are able to assess a patient’s needs and provide sound advice and treatment. In western countries such as the uS, australia, Ireland, and the uK, university training for herbal practitioners and naturopaths has become the norm; for these degree courses, practitioners are trained in both medical and herbal sciences. In China and India, universities teaching traditional medicine train practitioners to a standard equivalent to that of conventional medical practitioners.

making herbal medicines
The journey from hedgerow, garden, or medicinal plant farm to the finished herbal product takes many different forms. Wherever they are grown, however, medicinal plants need to be harvested and processed appropriately to achieve good-quality results and effective remedies.
many medicinal plants are still regularly picked from the wilda process known as wild-crafting. even in the developed world, herbs such as elder flowers and berries (Sambucus nigra), found in hedgerows and roadsides throughout the Us and europe, are wild-crafted both on a commercial basis and locally, to make herbal medicines and medicinal wines. in the developing world, herbs are as often wild-crafted as cultivated. in some cases, for example in some african countries, nearly 90 percent of herbal medicines used are gathered from the wild. such a dependence on wildcrafting can threaten the survival of
important medicinal plant species, especially if roots or bark are the main part of the plant used. however, the main threat comes from commercial wild-crafting, where plants are gathered as a cash crop for export rather than for use locally as medicines. There are many examples of medicinal plants being pushed close to the point of extinction in this way

europe are threatened species that are now being extensively cultivated. Until recently, echinacea (Echinacea spp.) was a common wild plant in its native north america; due to excessive wild-crafting, it is now rare to find it in the wild. The convention on international Trade in endangered species of Wild Flora and Fauna (ciTes) accord helps prevent trade in endangered plant species, and by and large the needs of economics and conservation point the same way; cultivation makes better sense. common medicinal plants such as german chamomile (Chamomilla recutita) are grown on a large scale in places as far afield as egypt and argentina. demand for ginkgo (Ginkgo

biloba) has led to large plantations now found in countries such as France and the Usa, where the leaves are harvested by agricultural machinery. as demand for herbal medicine grows, large-scale cultivation is more economically viable. Organically grown medicinal plants are to be preferred over conventionally grown ones. being produced without chemical interference, they develop naturally and absorb nutrients from the soil. They should also be relatively free from inorganic fertilizers, pesticides, and pollutants. Organic certification provides some evidence that a plant meets certain quality standards and has been cultivated or wild-crafted in an ecologically sensitive manner.
Whatever the size of the crop, the same basic rules apply. although drying sheds and dehumidifiers are used industrially, a warm, well-ventilated drying rack such as an airing cabinet or a lowheated oven with the door open will suffice. collect only plant material that you will be able to use or dry at once.
Harvesting Herbs • Try to harvest on a sunny, dry morning after the dew has evaporated. • ensure that you are picking the right plant, and the right part of it; using the wrong part may be dangerous. • Use a sharp knife or scissors; cut perennials to encourage regrowth. • do not pick plants with blight or insect damage, nor plants growing in a polluted area. • Plants are generally best harvested in the following stages: flowers, when just opening; leaves, when fully open; fruits, berries, and seeds, when ripe; whole plants, when mature.
Drying
• drying is best done in a shaded, wellventilated area. racks within a drying frame or airing cabinet are good,
especially for leaves, flowers, roots, and bark, but whole plants can be hung up from a shaded line. Fresh plant material can be chopped and laid out on brown paper to dry; do not use newsprint—the inks are toxic. • discard poorly dried plant material, for example where the leaves are discolored or where they show signs of fungal infection. • Once dry, chop or break up the herb material into small pieces suitable for storage in labeled, sterilized glass jars or brown paper bags.
making herbal medicines 27



Although many people’s image of herbal medicine involves pans of bubbling liquids and strange-smelling bottles, the truth is that in many parts of the world, herbal products—tablets and capsules especially—are likely to be produced in a setting as far away from the kitchen countertop as possible. A large part of the herbal medicine industry is perhaps more accurately known as the phyto-pharmaceutical industry, with multimillion dollar, hightech, hermetically sealed factories. Many larger herb growers and phytopharmaceutical manufacturers are in fact owned by mainstream pharmaceutical companies. Enter one of the large phytopharmaceutical manufacturing sites and you will only find evidence of the herbal origin of its products in the Goods Inward section! Remedies produced on an industrial scale to good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards are likely to be of good quality, and might be expected to be better than those produced in a more traditional, low-tech manner. However, much as is the case with small-scale, high-quality wine production, small-scale herb manufacturers often manage to produce plant material and herbal remedies of a distinctly higher quality than industrially produced over-the-counter remedies. That being said, GMP gives the buyer assurance that over-thecounter products should consistently meet acceptable quality standards.
capsules and tablets Most capsules and tablets are industrially produced. Some are made with finely powdered herb material, though many are manufactured from soft or dry extracts. Various liquid
solvents are used to dissolve the main active constituents found in the plant. These are then evaporated off, leaving a soft extract that contains about 20–30 percent water. Dry extracts are easily powdered and typically contain no more than 5 percent water. These extracts are then prepared as tablets, for example, to provide a uniform dose.
standardized extracts Standardized dried herb material or extracts are herbal products—typically capsules, tablets, and tinctures—that contain a minimum level of one or more key constituents. Using sensitive scientific measuring equipment, for example high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), batches of herb material are tested to establish levels of these constituents. Batches that meet the required levels of a given constituent are termed “standardized.” Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba), standardized on its flavone glycoside content, and milk thistle (Silybum marianum), standardized on its silymarin content, are common examples. Some herbs are standardized on two different constituents: in the case of St. John’s wort
(Hypericum perforatum), some products are standardized on its hypericin content, some on its hyperforin content, and some on both! Most people would agree that this kind of quality control is valuable, especially in over-the-counter remedies. However, a more sophisticated method looks at the chemical fingerprint of the plant—the overall pattern of constituents extracted—that reflects the plant’s natural complexity, sometimes referred to as a “full spectrum” of ingredients. Many people argue that this approach more accurately reflects herbal quality: it is the complex mix of constituents in a plant, not just one or

two isolated constituents, that produces its medicinal benefit. At least five different processes have been identified that contribute to the antidepressant activity of St. John’s wort, for example. For this reason, herbal practitioners typically stock and dispense dried herbs and tinctures produced by small-scale manufacturers who use this “full spectrum” method of quality control.
purified extracts A strong case can be made that standardized extracts that are purifiedwhere levels of some constituents are enhanced at the expense of othersare not herbal remedies at all, but partherbal, part-chemical medicines. Purified extracts are often highly concentrated—indeed, selected constituents can be so highly concentrated, by up to 2000-fold, that few other plant chemicals will be present. Such products may be

valuable, but they cannot fairly claim to be herbal medicines. Red clover (Trifolium pratense) isoflavone extracts, and some aloe vera (Aloe vera) products, are examples of this type of process. When buying herbal remedies, look at the label for information about standardization and refer to What the label should tell you on pp.50–51.
skin creams
Good-quality herbal skin creams undergo the same quality-control procedures as capsules, tablets, or tinctures.

Types of herbal remedy
herbal remedies are prepared and used in many different ways, and it can often be hard to decide which form of remedy to select. The following section gives details of the main types of herbal preparation available, along with a summary of their pros and cons.
herbal remedies can be made in a number of different ways, each method having its own specific advantages and disadvantages. many preparations, for example teas and tinctures, are traditional and have been used to make medicines for thousands of years; no specialized equipment is required to make them. others, however, require modern pharmaceutical methods of extraction, and use a wide range of solvents and processes. such extracts are most frequently made into tablets and capsules.
extracting the active Though it is not commonly recognized, the processes used to make a medicine directly influence its effect on the body. for example, ginger root (Zingiber officinalis) can be eaten fresh or dried in food, taken as a powder or capsule, made into a tea or tincture, or processed to produce a concentrated extract. in small but nonetheless significant ways, each process extracts a
different cross-section of chemicals within the plant, known as “the active.” ginger contains antiseptic resins that are poorly soluble in water, so ginger tea contains almost no resins; however, a ginger tincture made with 90 percent alcohol (ethanol) extracts them well, thus having a greater antiseptic activity. in day-to-day life, roughly the same applies to coffee. espresso machines were designed to extract maximum
flavor and, contrary to popular belief, relatively low levels of caffeine. in contrast, coffee percolators extract far higher levels of caffeine while much of the finer flavor is destroyed by the continued heating. (percolated coffee is not thought to be a healthy way to drink coffee.) The following are the most frequently used types of herbal preparation. details on making remedies are given in The home herbal on pp.36–37. for dosage advice, see pp.44–45.
ginger
Fresh and dried ginger root are seen as distinct remedies in Chinese herbal medicine. As the root dries, new compounds are formed and some of the essential oil in the fresh root evaporates.

Types of herbal remedy 31
teas/infusions
Teas, or infusions, are the simplest way to make an herbal remedy, using the more delicate aerial (above-ground) parts of a plant—especially fresh or dried leaves and flowers. Teas are good for extracting water-soluble constituents such as flavonoids, for example in hawthorn leaves (Crataegus spp.), and essential oils, for example in peppermint (Mentha × piperita). use a glass or ceramic (not metal) pot or cup with a lid to infuse the herb. loose herbs are generally better than teabagsit can be stirred and dispersed throughout the teapot or cup, improving extraction. brew for 10 minutes then strain.
Pros Quick and easy to make; several herbs can be combined; fresh or dried herb material can be used; can be drunk, used as a mouthwash or gargle, applied as a lotion, hair rinse, and so forth; being diluted in water, is fairly easily absorbed.
Cons must be used quickly (maximum 24 hours, refrigerated); only watersoluble constituents extracted; taste can be unpleasant; a relatively large amount of liquid needs to be consumed.
herbal infusions
Brewing tea bags or an infuser in an open cup is fine for nonaromatic herbs. Brew herbs that contain essential oils in a teapot.
Decoctions
decoctions are the most straightforward way to prepare tougher plant parts such as bark, berries, and roots. Chopped fresh or dried material is simmered in water for about 20 minutes. The resulting liquid is strained and drunk. decoctions are good for extracting water-soluble constituents such as tannins, for example in witch hazel bark (Hamamelis virginiana). like infusions, they have long traditional use and are still the main method of preparation used in traditional Chinese medicine.
Pros Can use fresh or dried herb material; several herbs can be combined; can be drunk, used as a mouthwash or gargle, applied as a lotion, and so forth; being diluted in water, fairly easily absorbed.
Cons Take a little time to make; must be consumed quickly (maximum 48 hours, refrigerated); taste can be very unpleasant.
Juices
Juices can be bought or made at home. high-powered juice extractors are better than standard fruit and vegetable juicers. When properly prepared, juices contain a wide range of constituents, including enzymes that are lost when the plant is dried. use organic produce as far as possible.
Pros relatively easy to make; 100 percent natural product with high enzyme and micro-nutrient content; easily absorbed and aid digestive function.
Cons must be kept refrigerated and, if bottled, consumed within 10 days; best not combined with other herbs; taste can be unpleasant.
Decoction of schisanDra



tinctures
Tinctures are made by macerating (soaking) chopped herb material from any part of the plant in an alcohol solution, typically 45 percent alcohol to 55 percent water. The proportion of alcohol used varies from 25 percent to 90 percent, depending upon the active constituents to be extracted. sometimes vinegar or glycerol is used instead of alcohol. Tinctures are relatively easily made and keep well, for three years or more. by using an alcohol and water mix both water-soluble and non-water-soluble constituents can be extracted, leading to a more concentrated product than is possible with teas or decoctions. The ratio of herb material to water and alcohol determines the strength of the tincture. an appropriate strength for most commonly available tinctures is 1 part herb material to 3 parts water and alcohol.
Pros long shelf life; different tinctures easily combined together; wide range of constituents extracted; small amounts effective; very easily absorbed.
Cons Takes several days to produce but can be easily purchased; can taste very unpleasant; contains alcohol (sometimes at high levels).
syrups
syrups are usually made by adding unrefined sugar or honey to infusions or decoctions at a ratio of 1:1 (half and half). Their sweetness can mask
unpalatable herbs. The sugars help soothe irritation within the throat and chest, and syrups are classically used as cough mixtures. syrups, linctuses, and cordials can be bought over the counter or made at home.
Pros fairly long shelf life; sweet-tasting and can be combined with unpleasanttasting remedies; good for coughs.
Cons large amounts of sugar; limited applications.
capsules
Capsules generally contain dried powdered herb material or soft or dry concentrated extracts. good-quality capsules are densely packed so that air cannot circulate through the powder. Vegetarian or non-vegetarian gelatine capsules (size 00) can be purchased for filling at home. sealed capsules containing oils or concentrated soft or dry extracts are similar in action to tablets (see below) but usually contain fewer binding agents and additives.
Pros Convenient to take, and with little taste; clearly defined dose; often standardized.
Cons Cannot be blended like tinctures; powders can occasionally be irritant; may be excessively concentrated.
tablets
Tablets can be made by simply compressing dried herb material or a dry extract into tablet form, though usually herb material is combined with excipients (binding agents and additives) that maintain the tablet’s shape and structure but dissolve in the stomach or intestines. regrettably, artificial sweeteners and colors are often used in tablet formulation, so read the label.

Pros Convenient and concentrated; clearly defined dose; often standardized; little taste.
Cons may dissolve poorly in the digestive tract; may be excessively concentrated; cannot be blended like tinctures.
fixeD oils
unlike essential oils, fixed oils are made by soaking herb material in a vegetable oil, such as sunflower. fixed oils are typically made with herbs that have wound-healing properties, for example marigold (Calendula officinalis), and can be applied neat to minor cuts, grazes, sprains, and so forth. They can also be used in creams and ointments.
Pros easily massaged into the skin: blend well with essential oils.
Cons often greasy—ointments or creams may be better.
freeze-DrieD extracts used increasingly in traditional Chinese medicine, freeze-dried extracts are made using a process similar to instant coffee. They have the full range of constituents found in the herb or herb formula.
Pros Convenient; clearly defined dose; often standardized.
Cons expensive; not readily available.
powDers
used traditionally in ayurvedic medicine, powders are easy to take. They tend to deteriorate quicker than normal dried herb material.
Pros easy to take.
Cons may taste unpleasant; need to be carefully stored.
ointments anD creams
ointments are made using oils and fats, and usually contain no water. being oily they form a waterproof, protective surface on the skin and are most useful in conditions such as hemorrhoids and diaper rash. Creams are made by emulsifying oils and water in an emulsion, much as in mayonnaise. They are cooling and moisten the skin, and are used to soothe sore and inflamed skin conditions. avoid applying ointments and creams to open wounds.
Pros formulated for the skin.
Cons may contain artificial preservatives and stabilizers.
essential oils essential oils are mostly produced by distilling flowers, leaves, and so forth and collecting the resulting oil – the plant’s “essence.” being very concentrated, they must be used with care. Typically, they are blended in a carrier oil such as grapeseed oil at a maximum 5 percent dilution, for example 1ml of essential oil in 20ml of carrier oil, or 5 drops in a teaspoon of carrier oil. essential oils should not be taken internally, unless on the instruction of a suitably qualified doctor, medical herbalist, or naturopath.
Pros highly concentrated; pleasant aroma; can be used diluted on skin or dispersed in air by burner.
Cons Can occasionally cause irritation or allergic skin reactions.

herbal remedies at home
making simple herbal preparations is easy provided you follow a few straightforward rules—the most important being to start with correctly identified herb material. the dosages given below apply to most (but not all) commonly available herbal remedies—see pp.44–45.
PreParing a herbal tea
1 Use 1 heaped teaspoonful of fresh or dried herb material (bark, berries, root) and put in a nonaluminum saucepan. add 11⁄2 cups of water and gently bring to a boil. simmer for approximately 20 minutes.
2 remove from the heat and carefully strain into a cup or other container. add honey if desired and drink. larger quantities can be prepared if required, for example 1oz (25g) herb material to 1⁄4 cup water.
1 add 1 heaped teaspoonful of fresh or 1 level teaspoonful of dried herb material (leaves, flowers) to a teapot. Pour in a cupful of boiling water.
2 stir, cover, and let stand for 10 minutes. strain, add honey if desired, and drink.
PreParing a decoction
Using herbal remedies
34



PreParing a tincture
1 a standard tincture is made using 1 part dried herb material to 3 parts alcohol solution. Place the chopped herb material—root, leaf, flower, or fruit—in a clean, preferably sterilized, glass jar or pan and stir in the required amount of alcohol. For each 4oz (100g) of dried herb material, add 1 cup of alcohol solution (for strength see box shown right). stir well, make sure that herb material is fully covered, close lid, and label clearly.
2 stir or shake the contents thoroughly for a few minutes each day, for 10 days. strain into a sterilized glass bottle, seal with a cap, and label.
Storing herbal material at home
Dried herb material is best stored in glass jars. Jars should be clean and dry, and preferably sterilized. Fill the jar close to the top with herb material and close the lid firmly.
For short-term storage (a few months) dried herb material can be kept in clean brown paper bags, folded over and secured with a rubber band. Clearly label the jar or bag with the following information:
•
Name, and part, of plant
•
Date of harvesting.
•
Keep in a cool, dry, dark place, away from heat and direct sunlight. Keep out of reach of children and animals.
•
Dried herbs should be used within 12 months of harvesting. Tinctures can remain effective for 3 years or more. Capsules and tablets should have a “Use By” date on the container.
•
Dried herb material that changes color due to damp or fungal infection, or has mites (insect infestation), should not be used. Put it in the garden compost or place in a sealed plastic bag in a waste bin.
alcohol Solution
For tinctures, use organic vodka or other goodquality spirit of similar strength. Fresh plant materials require a 40 percent alcohol solution. Dried plant material can be made with lowerstrength alcohol, typically 25 percent. Below 20 percent, alcohol solution tinctures may decay.
herbal remedies at home 35



The home herbal
herbal remedies can prove highly effective in treating minor health and first aid problems. Cuts, scrapes, headaches, digestive upsets, and so on can be dealt with effectively using just a few herbal products. Keeping a range of remedies available makes good sense.
Selecting herbal remedies to complement a standard first aid kit containing standard items such as adhesive bandages and scissors can be an enjoyable activity. The 10 remedies shown below are readily available in natural pharmacies and health food stores and are useful to have at home for minor domestic emergencies. For details of their uses and applications, see the relevant entry in the a–Z section on pages 52–255.
Note Creams and ointments should not be put on open wounds: use water, aloe vera (Aloe vera), or witch hazel (Hamamelis virginiana) water to wash cuts and scrapes, and then bathe with diluted echinacea (Echinacea spp.) or myrrh (Commiphora molmol) tincture. Warning! This will disinfect the area but will sting painfully for a short time. burns should be held under cold water for at least 10 minutes before applying aloe vera or lavender (Lavendula spp.) essential oil.

The herb garden
growing herbs in the garden can bring real pleasure and a sense of achievement. Culinary herbs add zest to familiar recipes, and their scent lingers on summer evenings. at the same time, even a few medicinal herbs become a first aid resource for common health problems.
beyond the kitchen shelf and bathroom medicine cabinet, your home herbal pharmacy can extend out onto the window sill, balcony, or garden. given adequate light, water, and food, many medicinal plants will thrive and a surprising number can be grown even in a small area. Living medicinal plants are a useful resource to have at hand; they are also a joy to work with and to have in the garden. Label plants so that when you are harvesting them you know precisely what material you are gathering. If you are planting in the garden, choose herbs such as lemon balm (Melissa officinalis) or yarrow (Achillea
millefolium) that grow vigorously in most soils and harvest well. buying seeds or
plants from specialist herb suppliers is usually the best way to stock a medicinal herb garden. Other herbs that are readily cultivated at home include: Calendula (Calendula officinalis) echinacea (Echinacea spp.) Californian poppy (Eschscholzia californica) Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) Lavender (Lavandula spp.) Parsley (Petroselinum crispum) rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) Sage (Salvia officinalis) Thyme (Thymus vulgaris) Feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium) Vervain (Verbena officinalis) Cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon).
The righT planT
Medicinal plant cultivation is fairly straightforward, but it is important to start with: • The right plant species – Aloe vera is a safe and effective plant medicine, but some Aloe species are poisonous. • The right variety – some varieties are more medicinally active than others. a specific variety of damiana (Turnera diffusa var. aphrodisiaca) is generally used. • If the plant’s essential oil is important, the right chemotype – plants of the same species and variety can differ in their chemical constituents, especially in their essential oils, for example lavender (Lavandula angustifolia).

Container herbs
Many herbs will grow well in pots or other types of containers, including the following:

safety concerns
Herbal remedies are natural but they are also medicines, and can cause side effects. Like all medicines, they need to be treated with respect and used carefully. the following section gives information and simple advice on the risks associated with taking herbal remedies.
Side effectS
Herbal remedies have an excellent track record when it comes to safety, and side effects are very infrequent. However, unwanted reactions do occur and it is important to be alert to this possibility, especially when taking a remedy for the first time. adverse reactions to herbal remedies usually involve minor symptoms such as digestive upset and headache. on stopping the remedy, symptoms usually clear slowly. sometimes, existing symptoms can flare up when starting a new remedy. In either case, if you suspect that you are reacting badly to an herbal remedy, stop taking it. If symptoms are severe, or continue to worsen despite stopping the remedy, seek immediate advice from your health
care practitioner. If the symptoms are minor, try an alternative remedy. remedies that contain potentially irritant or toxic constituents, for example horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum), are more likely to produce side effects and need to be treated with caution. sticking to recommended dosage levels is important, especially in the case of children. taking excessive doses of any medicine, whether herbal or conventional is likely to lead to side effects. allergic reactions to herbal medicines, even familiar ones such as German chamomile (Chamomilla recutita), are rare but do sometimes occur. Mild allergic reactions should begin to ease soon after contact with the remedy is ended—applying marigold (Calendula officinalis) cream and drinking nettle (Urtica dioica) tea can help with minor skin reactions. severe allergic reactions are a medical emergency and need immediate medical attention. for people who have allergies to plants or foods, or are known to be sensitive to medicines, it’s a good policy to start new herbal remedies by taking a small amount, say half the minimum recommended dose. If everything is fine, build up over a few days to the standard dose; if it’s not fine, stop! Known cautions are listed for each herb in the a–Z of Herbal remedies, pp.52–255.
contraindicationS some herbal remedies need to be avoided in preexisting health conditions, since they may worsen symptoms. for
Half dose If prone to allergies start with a low dose.
dosage
Horse chestnut seed contains saponins that can irritate the gastrointenstinal tract. At the normal dosage, side effects are unlikely to occur.

example, people with high blood pressure should not take large doses of licorice (Glycyrrhiza
glabra), because its action on the adrenal glands can lead to raised blood pressure. Licorice is therefore contraindicated in cases of high blood pressure—although, for the same reason, it may sometimes be a useful remedy in people with low blood pressure. If you already have an existing unrelated health problem, remedies should be carefully selected in order to avoid using those that are contraindicated. each remedy listed in the a–Z of Herbal remedies can be checked for known contraindications. Pregnancy and breast-feeding are the situations where herbal remedies are most commonly contraindicated. some remedies are unsuitable to take during pregnancy and breast-feeding, and in the first three months of pregnancy all medication including herbal remedies should be avoided as far as possible. for more details, see Pregnancy and after on pp.46–47.
Herb–drug interactionS
some herbs (and foods) influence the effects of conventional medicines, interacting with them and increasing or decreasing their strength of action. often interaction between a herb, for
example schisandra (Schisandra chinensis) or cat’s claw (Uncaria
tormentosa) and a drug will be minor and go unnoticed, but in some cases herb-drug interactions can cause serious, even life-threatening problems. the potential of st. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) to interact with prescribed drugs has been intensively researched after it was found to speed up clearance of a number of drugs from the body. a report in The Lancet (2000) described the case of a heart transplant patient recovering well in the hospital who went quickly downhill after taking st. John’s wort. on investigation it was discovered that st. John’s wort had caused levels of ciclosporin, an immunosuppressant drug, to drop by 50 percent, leading his body to start rejecting his new heart. on ceasing to take st. John’s wort, he quickly recovered. this is an extreme example, but it illustrates that herb-drug interactions are real and need to be taken into account. If you are taking drugs prescribed by your doctor or hospital, check with them, or with a registered herbal or naturopathic practitioner, before taking an herbal remedy. you can report an adverse reaction to a herbal remedy in the us at: http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/how.htm.
main Herb–drug interactions
The main categories of prescribed drugs requiring caution are:
•
Anticoagulants, antidepressants, antiepileptics, and immunosuppressants; the effectiveness of oral contraceptives can also be affected.
•
If you are taking prescribed medicines, do not stop taking them in order to start taking an herbal remedy. Seek professional advice from your doctor or herbal practitioner on the best way to proceed.
licorice
The root contains constituents that stimulate the release of hormones by the adrenal glands. This action is mainly responsible for its effectiveness as an anti-inflammatory remedy.
safety concerns 43



dosage and sensible use
as with all medicines, getting the dosage right is essential. Too much and you risk overdosing, too little and the remedy may not work. Follow the guidelines on these pages to ensure that you use herbal remedies safely and appropriately.
Adult dosAges
each of the remedies listed in the a–Z of Herbal Remedies has a letter indicating its adult dosage—how much of the herb to take per day or per week. To take an example, passion flower (Passiflora incarnata) on p.173 has C for its dosage. looking at the dosage guide (right), it can be seen that C = 2–4g a day or 30g a week. Passion flower should therefore be taken at these recommended dosages. as another example, hawthorn leaf (Crataegus spp.) has M and C for its dosage. M applies to manufactured products: take prepackaged hawthorn products, such as standardized tablets and capsules, at the manufacturer’s recommended dosage. C applies to dried hawthorn leaf or berry: take at the recommended daily or weekly dosage, i.e. 2–4g a day or 30g a week. similarly, each of the other letters gives specific recommendations on how to use the herb.
Teas and decoctions The dosages
given in the guide apply when making teas and decoctions from dried herb material—bark, leaves, roots, etc. For fresh herb material you can use 11⁄2–2 times the quantity of dried material.
Tinctures it is not possible to give clear guidelines for tinctures owing to the wide variation in their strength. ask advice on dosage when purchasing a tincture. in general, the dosage range for a 1:3 tincture is the same (in milliliters not grams) as the above dosages, i.e. for a, the dosage of a 1:3 tincture is 5–15ml a day
adult dosage guide
Recommended ADULT dosage as given in the key information boxes (see opposite page). For children and people over 70, see below and opposite.
A = 5–15g a day, or max. 100g (31⁄2 oz) per week
B = 3–7.5g a day, or max. 50g (2 oz) per week
C = 2–4g a day, or max. 30g (1 oz) per week
D = 1–2g a day, or max. 15g (1⁄2 oz) per week
M = Take product at manufacturer’s recommended dosage.
T = Topical application on the skin only (Note: preparations made specifically for topical use should not be taken internally.)
Powders Take the minimum recommended daily dosage only.
Tablets and capsules Take at the
manufacturer’s recommended dosage.
children’s dosAges
do not give babies under 6 months any medication without professional advice. You may need to adjust dosage levels for children who are particularly small or large for their age.
From 6 months to 1 year: give 1/10 th the minimum adult dose From 1 to 6 years: give 1/3rd the minimum adult dose From 7 to 11 years: give 1⁄2 the minimum adult dose From 12 to 16 years: give the low adult dose.

dosAges for over 70s
as we age, our bodies become less efficient at breaking down drugs, including herbs. From the age of about 70 onward it is advisable to take slightly lower doses: 80 percent of the standard adult dose is normally recommended. in very old and frail people the dosage may need to be as low as 50 percent of the standard adult dosage.
generAl cAutions
• do not take essential oils internally unless on advice of a suitably qualified health care professional. • do not give herbs to babies under 6 months old. • do not exceed the recommended dosage levels.
• if you are taking drugs prescribed by your doctor or hospital, check with them, or with a registered herbal or naturopathic practitioner, before taking a herbal remedy. • People known to have allergies should start by taking a low dose and, if this is fine, then increase the dose. • Contact allergy can occur on handling fresh or dried herbs. Where such allergy occurs, do not take the remedy internally. some people are allergic to specific plant families, for example the daisy (Asteraceae) family. several herbs listed in this book, including chamomile (Chamomilla recutita), echinacea (Echinacea spp.), and
feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium), belong to this family and are known to cause contact allergy in sensitive individuals.

Pregnancy and after
Herbal medicine has an important role to play as part of a natural approach to health care for expectant mothers and their children. While caution is required in avoiding potentially harmful remedies, many gentle-acting herbs can safely be used during pregnancy and beyond.
Herbal remedies can be safe to take during pregnancy, although for the first three months of pregnancy, they should be taken only after consulting a professional. from the fourth month onward, a range of safe and effective remedies may be used to treat simple health problems such as colds and constipation. Select remedies with a long history of use in pregnancy and with no evidence of risk to mother or baby. the box below gives examples. check labels of herbal products carefully, especially where herbs and other constituents are combined together. alcohol should be avoided during the first three months, even in the small amounts present in tinctures.

By and large children respond very well to herbal remedies, even if the taste can make administering them a bit of a struggle! adding honey or mixing with apple juice will usually help make remedies more palatable. tablets or capsules can usually be opened and ground up, and taken on a spoon mixed with honey, maple syrup, and so forth. children typically fall ill and recover quickly. this can be very alarming for parents, since a healthy child at 8:00 am can be a very unwell one by 11:00 am. the main worry in acute illness is controlling fever and keeping the temperature below 102of (39oc). children with fevers approaching this level (and above) need medical attention. that being said, the very unwell child at 2:00 pm can be running around again by 6:00 pm; children bounce back. get to know your child’s typical pattern when falling ill—you will often be able to recognize the difference between day-to-day problems and a potentially serious illness. the former can be safely treated with herbal remedies, while the latter needs professional advice and treatment. If in doubt, always err on the side of caution and seek advice.

tips for home use
self-treatment of minor health problems makes sense, and besides helping one to feel better, can be very satisfying. these pages give a few tips on how to refine the use of herbal remedies. in cases of more serious illness, it is wise to consult a qualified herbal practitioner.
• Decide what the main symptoms are. • select remedies that are known to help these symptoms, for example cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) for cystitis, elderflower (Sambucus nigra) for colds and sinus congestion. • Develop experience using specific remedies and build up your own stock of herbal remedies.
How many to use
• Combining 2–4 herbal remedies together can prove more effective, particularly if the problem is stubborn or recurs frequently; for example recurrent cystitis infection may be treated with cranberry, plus remedies such as buchu (Barosma betulina),
echinacea (Echinacea spp.), and cornsilk (Zea mays).
• Combine remedies as teas or tinctures, or purchase a product containing the required remedies.
wHen and How mucH to take
• herbal remedies are generally best taken with water about 30 minutes before a meal. • take the recommended daily amount in 2–3 divided doses, ideally before your breakfast, lunch, and evening meal. • moderate to high doses of an herb can be taken for a few days for minor acute problems, for example if you are experiencing a sudden onset of cystitis symptoms, take cornsilk at the upper end of its dosage range (10–15g a day) for 3–4 days. • Low to moderate doses should be used
for long-term problems, for example in the case of chronic bladder irritation, take cornsilk regularly at a low dosage (5–7.5g a day).
How long to take for • self-limiting conditions such as a sore throat or stomach upset that are safe to treat at home should clear within 10–14 days at the most. if you are not fully recovered by then, see your health care practitioner. • start treatment as soon as possible, before symptoms become full-blown. • some remedies may be taken longterm to prevent or treat chronic illness, for example ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba) to maintain healthy mental function or boswellia (Boswellia serrata) to provide relief for arthritic pain and stiffness.
how to choose the right remedy
Cranberry juiCe Cranberry is a classic home remedy for cystitis. Drink up to 11/3 pint (3⁄4 liter) unsweetened juice a day for a few days to treat acute symptoms.

• Do not put off getting professional advice when symptoms are worrying, especially if severe pain or a temperature of over 102°f (39°C) are present, or if symptoms deteriorate sharply or unexpectedly. professional advice, including telephone help lines, will help ensure that you have the right treatment at the right time. • more detailed guidance on when to seek professional advice is given in Common health problems, pp.256–275.
How can an Herbal practitioner Help?
• herbal practitioners are trained, often at university, to use their in-depth knowledge of herbal medicine to assess and treat a wide range of health problems. they are able to give detailed advice on the best remedies and products to use, together with appropriate advice on diet and lifestyle. Where appropriate, they will refer to other practitioners, including medical doctors, and can advise on interactions between herbs and drugs. • if you have ongoing health problems, or want access to natural health care
What health problems do herbalists treat best?
Herbal practitioners specialize in treating health problems with herbal medicine, and give advice on diet and supplements. The following types of conditions often benefit from treatment:
• allergies • anxiety and stress-related problems • arthritic and rheumatic conditions • chronic infection and fatigue • chronic inflammatory diseases • mild to moderate depression • digestive complaints • menstrual and menopausal problems • skin disorders
When to seek professional advice
for your family, contact herbal practitioners in your area and find one with whom you feel comfortable and you trust. Check that your practitioner, or medical herbalist, is insured and a member of a professional body such as the american herbalists Guild in the us. he or she should provide you with details of likely costs of initial and follow-up consultations and herbs.
herbal dispensary
Medical herbalists stock a wide range of medicines. Each patient receives an individually tailored prescription, normally dispensed on the spot.

how to buy remedies
when buying a remedy, select a suitable herb or combination for your health problem, such as feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium) for migraine headaches. decide how you want to take it, for example as a capsule, and compare the different products available.
where to obtain herbal remedies
most people working with herbal medicine recommend buying remedies from a reputable health food shop or pharmacy. try to find a shop that specializes in natural medicines, where the staff is knowledgeable and receives regular in-house training. their advice can help to guide you toward buying appropriate, good-quality remedies. shops that sell dried herbs and dispense tinctures are likely to have the most knowledgeable staff and should be actively concerned to supply goodquality herbal produce. do not be afraid to ask how they can be sure that the products they sell are of good quality. buying remedies from an herbal practitioner is also a reliable way of obtaining them. he or she will stock products from growers and suppliers with a long-established record of quality control. remember that the ethical code of a professional herbalist prevents him or her from selling you an herbal remedy without a consultation, for which you will usually have to pay. this is to check up on your health and make sure that you receive the right advice for your situation. however, you will probably find that herbs supplied by a practitioner compare favorably in cost and quality with herbs obtained elsewhere. herbal remedies can also be purchased via mail order or the internet, and in some cases you can source innovative products that are hard to find in a local health food shop. however, it can be very hard to distinguish between suppliers of
genuine products and those that are there for the quick sale. some mail order and internet companies deliberately base themselves in countries where proper quality control can be bypassed. where they are available, choosing organically certified herbal medicines makes sense on several counts, as plants are grown free of pesticides and pollutants, sites are regularly inspected, and the harvesting of organic herbs supports conservation in the wild.
Quality and value for money
the price of herbal remedies is directly linked to quality. As a general rule, buy remedies produced by specialist herbal companies or well-known manufacturers, where effective quality control should be routine. retailers who consistently market remedies at prices lower than the norm are either taking a loss or selling products of doubtful quality! the best-value remedies are often sold at middle-of-the-road prices, reflecting acceptable quality. in some cases, for example ginseng (Panax ginseng), genuine high-quality products are available, and the higher price reflects this. sadly, poor-quality herbal products are still commonplace. if you take st. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) for mild to moderate depression, for example, it is reasonable to expect some signs of improvement. if no change occurs, this might be due to poor quality. try a different product, perhaps a tea or tincture, instead.

Colds, flu, and fever Yarrow is most commonly taken as a tea to ease cold and flu symptoms, control associated fever, and speed recovery. Drink the tea hot, since this strongly stimulates sweating and encourages cooling. Increased sweating can help to reduce fever and leads to improved cleansing of waste products from the body. It combines particularly well with elderflower (Sambucus nigra).
Yarrow
Achillea millefolium
Used as something of a cure-all, yarrow is an excellent remedy for colds, flu, and fever. It is equally good for healing cuts and bruises and slowing or stopping bleeding, for example, nosebleed. The Ancient Greek hero Achilles reputedly used yarrow on his wounded troops during the Trojan War.
Other uses As a mild bitter, yarrow stimulates appetite and digestive activity, and is useful in treating diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome. It will help to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding and aids menstrual regularity. Yarrow is also a remedy for the circulation, helping to lower blood pressure, strengthen capillaries (small blood vessels), and tone varicose veins. Topically, the tea can be applied as a lotion to small cuts and abrasions.
mediCinal uses
In the Scottish Highlands, Yarrow was traditionally made into an ointment and applied as a salve to heal wounds and bruises, and treat skin problems.

mediCinal uses
upper respiratory infections, including colds, flu-like colds, and influenza. Several good-quality clinical trials have concluded that chiretta can reduce symptoms and improve the rate of recovery in people suffering from sinusitis, flu-like colds, and throat infection. It can also be helpful in gastrointestinal problems, such as food poisoning, gastroenteritis, and diarrhea. Studies suggest that chiretta is as effective as paracetamol in relieving flu and fever symptoms, taken consistently over several days for best results. Chiretta is best taken on professional advice in liver disorders, and it works well with other liver remedies, such as milk thistle (Silybum marianum). Chiretta is also being investigated for its ability to help prevent cancer.
while chiretta is used principally as an immuneenhancing remedy in the West, it is seen mainly as a digestive remedy in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine.

taken for several months for signs of improvement, as healing venous circulation can be a very difficult task. A clinical trial at london’s Barts Hospital in 1996 showed that horse chestnut extract was as effective as a compression stocking in treating varicose veins in the leg.
Other uses Horse chestnut may be used to treat other problems affecting the veins, for example, hemorrhoids and thread veins, and can be useful in treating leg cramps, and swelling and fluid retention in the legs. It may be taken to treat conditions such as deep vein thrombosis, frostbite, and leg ulcers, but only on professional advice. As a preventative, it will help reduce the risks of deep vein thrombosis, for example on long flights. An oil extracted from the conkers has been used as a topical application for rheumatism in france, while in the US, a decoction of the leaves has been considered useful for pertussis.

Infections Before modern antibiotics became commonly available, garlic was one of the most frequently used remedies to treat infection. In World War I, it was used to dress battle wounds. Although we have far more potent antibiotics today, garlic still has a place in treating infection. It makes an excellent remedy for all types of respiratory infections, including sinusitis, cold, flu, sore throat, cough,
and, more specifically, bronchitis. Swallowed whole (one small clove), eaten crushed in with food, or taken as a tablet, garlic will strengthen the body’s ability to fight infection and speed recovery. A simple and effective kitchen remedy for colds, sore throats, and coughs can be readily made by mixing a crushed clove of garlic with freshly squeezed lemon juice (Citrus limon), 1–2
teaspoons of honey, and a pinch of dried ginger (Zingiber officinalis) powder or, preferably, a small piece of chopped fresh ginger root. Place in a mug, add hot water, and stir. Drink up to three cups a day. Garlic may be taken alongside, and is likely to complement prescribed antibiotics, at the same time warding off possible side effects by helping to protect beneficial intestinal bacteria and reducing the chances of developing thrush. Applied consistently over several weeks, fresh garlic or garlic oil may prove successful in countering

arthritic and rheumatic problems Celery is a key remedy in european herbal medicine in the treatment of arthritic and rheumatic problems where joints, muscles, and tendons are sore, swollen, or stiff. The seed contains a volatile oil which stimulates the clearance of waste products by the kidneys. In particular, it supports the elimination of salts such as urates that often cause inflammation and stiffness within the muscular-skeletal system. Celery seed is taken to ease joint and muscle pain and stiffness, especially
Celery
Apium graveolens
A good detoxification remedy, celery stem, leaf, and seed stimulate the kidneys to clear waste products, especially helping to cleanse salts that accumulate in joints, causing stiffness and inflammation. Although celery today is considered to be a mild sedative, in earlier times it was believed to be an aphrodisiac.

Blood cleanser Although much
undervalued, burdock may be used in any situation in which the body needs increased clearance of waste products. Conditions as varied as acne, boils, eczema, arthritis, fibromyalgia, and tonsillitis will benefit from the herb’s pronounced ability to stimulate release of waste products from the cells.
Burdock
Arctium lappa
Traditionally combined with dandelion to make a tonic, cleansing drink, burdock is an important detox remedy in both Western and Chinese herbal traditions. Often used to treat skin problems, burdock also supports the immune system during infection and chronic illness.
However, it should be used with caution as even small amounts can cause an initial flare-up in symptoms, particularly in skin disorders. For this reason, it is rarely used on its own and is combined with remedies such as dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), red clover (Trifolium pratense), and yellow dock (Rumex crispus) that counterbalance its detoxifying action. Although it is not yet substantiated, burdock root is thought to have marked anticancer activity.
medicinal uses

Birch’s unusual combination of actions makes it a valuable remedy in conditions where symptoms reflecting kidney weakness—poor urine output, fluid retention, and puffiness—occur side by side with rheumatic problems such as stiff and aching muscles, arthritic pain, and leg cramps. By aiding the clearance of waste products in urine, birch leaves increase the body’s ability to remove waste products from joint and muscle tissues. The leaves contain aspirin-like substances which contribute to their ability to control inflammation and relieve pain. Traditional uses of birch include rheumatic pain, gout, fibromyalgia, and kidney and urinary tract infections such as cystitis. A warm decoction of the leaves and twigs can be applied to ease stiff and aching muscles. The sap is thought to have diuretic properties.

circulation When it is applied to the skin as a counterirritant, chili, like other hot, pungent remedies such as mustard (Sinapsis alba), causes irritation and swelling, and an increase in circulation to the area. Chili is added to lotions, liniments, and salves for muscular aches and pains for this reason, resulting in better nutrition to—and clearance of waste products from—the tissue involved.
Introduced to Europe in the 16th century, chili is now cultivated throughout the tropics.

nerve pain Chili peppers are graded according to their “heat”; the hotter the taste, the higher the level of capsaicinthe key active constituent present within the flesh of the pepper. Capsaicin initially increases the awareness of pain and inflammation, but then desensitizes the local nerve endings, leading to reduced levels of pain. This action is utilized in capsaicin creams for conditions such as post-herpetic neuralgia (shingles), nerve pain linked to diabetes, and also for severe itchiness. These products are often only available with a prescription.



chIlI “PePPer”
Chili was one of many medicinal plants Christopher Columbus brought back from the New World to present to his patrons, the Spanish king and queen. The hot taste of chili, similar to that of black pepper from Indonesia, encouraged Columbus to call it chili “pepper,” thereby suggesting that it also came from eastern Asia, and that his mission to find a western route to the East Indies had been successful.
General stimulant Rarely used on its own, chili is most commonly added to other herbs to strengthen and stimulate their action within the body. Adding small quantities of chili powder, sauce, or tincture can provide an important boost to the effects of an herbal mixture. For example, a few drops of chili sauce or tincture can be mixed with echinacea (Echinacea spp.) and licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) tincture to treat throat infection. To strengthen the circulation and to improve blood flow to hands and feet, small quantities of chili can be routinely added to food. Chili also mixes well with specific remedies such as devil’s claw
(Harpagophytum procumbens) when treating conditions such as osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia, where circulation to affected areas is often poor. Chili’s general stimulant effect also finds use where the thyroid gland is mildly underactive. here, chili will help to strengthen the circulation and improve metabolic rate. Recent research points to the possibility that chili works to enhance the anticancer activity of other antioxidant remedies. Although data is based so far only on test tube research, scientists found that when they combined 1 part chili preparation with 25 parts green tea concentrate, the anticancer activity of the combination was 100 times greater than the green tea alone. This suggests that chili can have a major impact on the medicinal activity of other foods and herbal remedies.

It has moderate antibacterial and antifungal activity, and acts against Heliobacter pylori, an organism that can cause stomach ulcers. In colds, flu, chest infection, and coughs, cinnamon provides a pleasant treatment that can be safely given to children.
other uses Cinnamon’s ability to stimulate the circulation is often overlooked; taken long-term, it strengthens blood flow to the hands and feet, helping those with poor peripheral circulation. It can also be taken on a regular basis—one recommendation is a teaspoon of cinnamon powder at night—to support stable blood sugar levels.

A remedy for scurvy long before vitamin C was identified, lemon (Citrus limon) is a valuable preventative medicine, increasing resistance to infection and helping to maintain good health.






Lemon is said to have originated in India. Its fruit, used as a natural medicine, is harvested in winter when the vitamin C content is at its highest.
Parts used Essential oil • Fruit/juice

Detoxification Most parts of the lemon can be used medicinally. The juice is taken as a cleansing drink, rich in vitamin C and antioxidant bioflavonoids, stimulates liver metabolism and detoxification. Diluted juice of a freshly squeezed lemon makes an excellent pre-breakfast drink. The juice makes an effective mouthwash and gargle; to achieve best results add a pinch of chili (Capsicum spp.) for mouth ulcers, gingivitis, and sore throat. It also stimulates the appetite, aids digestion, and improves absorption of iron. Its action on the liver means that it helps to reduce the tendency toward allergic reaction and promotes the elimination of waste products. Avoid drinking the juice neat, as it is strongly acidic and can dissolve tooth enamel. Brush teeth after drinking lemon juice.

are good reasons for thinking that it can be taken to improve symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, and poor sleep, although it is probable that the steroid compounds in wild yam are not converted to the active hormones in the human body that would thus make it effective for menopausal symptoms; perhaps there is another mechanism at work. Most experts recommend that for best results, the extract should be taken for several weeks to see if it alleviates

symptoms. Wild yam combines well with black cohosh (Cimifuga racemosa) for
menopausal and rheumatic problems.
natural progesterone cream Wild yam natural progesterone cream, applied to the skin rather than taken internally, has received much publicity as a treatment for menopausal problems. A number of clinical studies have failed to find any benefit in relieving symptoms in menopausal women, although there are undoubtedly women who have experienced relief of symptoms with the cream. It is perhaps misleading to describe the product as “natural,” as several laboratory processes are required in order to convert the steroidal compounds present in wild yam into progesterone. No plant has yet been found that contains progesterone. That being said, it is the case that hormones processed from natural sources are more readily used by the body than those that are produced synthetically.
other uses Wild yam has been used within Native American traditions to help prevent miscarriage in the later stages of pregnancy and to relieve pain during childbirth. In keeping with its traditional name of colic root, wild yam makes a useful treatment for irritable bowel and diverticulitis, especially if combined with slippery elm (Ulmus fulva).
native to the southern US, Mexico, and Central America, wild yam was known as colic root and rheumatism root, indicating its use by early settlers.
hormones from wild yam
Wild (and other) yams contain high levels of steroidal compounds, including dioscin, that have an oestrogenic activity. It was the original plant source of diosgenin produced by Japanese scientists in 1936. Diosgenin was synthesized in the laboratory into steroid hormones, and eventually led to the creation of the birth control pill.

Gas, bloating, digestive ill health
Cardamom’s main therapeutic use lies in easing discomfort within the upper digestive system, making it a valuable digestive remedy. Mildly warming and analgesic, its oil relieves colic and gas, and helps settle nausea, griping, and indigestion. It combines well with chamomile (Chamomilla recutita). Use crushed seed or tincture; take the essential oil internally only on professional advice.
Cardamom
Elettaria cardamomum
A well-known Indian condiment, cardamom has a warm, slightly spicy taste, and can be added to sweet and savory dishes alike. Its seeds combine well with other remedies to improve flavor and to soothe an upset digestive system. They also add zest to coffee, making a subtler stimulant than coffee alone.
Throat and chest problems The seeds’ warming and slightly antiseptic action extends to the throat and chest, making it a good addition to gargles for sore throat, and in chest problems such as asthma and bronchitis.
Male tonic The long-standing reputation of cardamom as an aphrodisiac, particularly in the Middle East, is supported by the presence of androgenic compounds within the seeds. Cardamom is most likely to be beneficial when combined with herbs such as damiana (Turnera diffusa) and Korean
ginseng (Panax ginseng).
Medicinal uses
An aromatic herb, cardamom is one of the oldest spices in the world. Apart from its medicinal value, it was also used in perfumes by the ancient Egyptians.

Siberian ginseng can provide much-needed support in times of poor health. usually in combination with other immune-stimulant remedies, its immune-enhancing and tonic properties make it suitable for chronic viral infections such as shingles, glandular fever, and chronic fatigue syndrome. even in severe illness, Siberian ginseng can contribute to an improved quality of life, and can be considered specifically for convalescence. In debilitated states and convalescence, Siberian ginseng is best taken for several months at a low to medium dosage. It is most likely to strengthen vitality when any improvement in energy levels is used to nurture a return to good health, and not spent on meeting external demands such as work.

The medicinal value of licorice was championed by the ancient Greek commander Alexander the Great (356–323 bce). It is said his troops chewed on licorice roots before a battle to give them fighting energy, which would have been derived from its effect on their blood sugar and adrenal glands. Soldiers also used it to quench thirst while marching, and thought it helped them stop shaking with fright during battle.

Anxiety, irritability, headache Anxiety and tension are key words for lavender, its calming qualities soothing nervous overactivity, stress-related headache, and migraine. Lavender combines well with rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) to alleviate nervous exhaustion and improve weak circulation. It is also known to have mood-enhancing properties. This combination of mild sedative and antidepressant activity makes it particularly suitable where lowered mood and vitality follow long-term worry or overactivity.
Sleep difficulties Used as essential oil (a few drops placed on an oil burner or used in a massage), dried flowers (in an herb pillow), or as a tincture (a teaspoon before going to bed), lavender improves sleep quality and the
chance of a good night’s sleep. It combines well with other herbal sleep remedies, notably passion flower (Passiflora incarnata) and lemon balm (Melissa officinalis).
Local pain relief and relaxation Lavender oil can be applied to the skin in almost any situation involving pain. Massage the oil onto herpes or shingles sores, rheumatic joints, the cheek overlying an aching tooth, or the forehead and temples for a migraine. A few drops of oil on a cotton ball plugged into the ear relieves a mild earache. Lavender tincture or tea can provide systemic support, helping relax tensed and aching muscles. For menstrual cramps and pain, tincture or tea taken internally and oil massaged into the lower abdomen can bring quick relief.
Digestive problems Most often combined with other digestive remedies, lavender has specific value where emotional distress is the underlying cause of digestive disturbance such as “butterflies” in the stomach, bloating, belching, and irritable bowel symptoms.

Taken through the long winter months of northern China by the frail and elderly, ginseng aids physical endurance, particularly in those with lowered vitality and poor immune function. Low doses taken longterm are most likely to prove effective.

Root and root extracts need to be of good quality for positive results and it is important to select a reputable brand or supplier; ideally, choose a standardized tincture or extract. Given the relatively high cost of ginseng root, adulterated products are not uncommon.
other uses Ginseng is most likely to prove helpful in treating chronic infection and a depleted immune system when used in combination with other immune-modulating remedies such as astragalus (Astragalus membranaceus) and echinacea (Echinacea spp.). Ginseng helps to enhance memory and recall and, combined with
ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba), can be useful to the elderly as a preventative for dementia. With cancer-preventative activity, ginseng can be a helpful restorative when recovering from cancer (seek professional advice here).

Yellow dock
Rumex crispus
A common weed and wayside plant, yellow dock has a deep taproot that draws up iron and other minerals from the soil, presenting them in an accessible form for absorption. The root is therefore prescribed in cases of iron-deficiency anemia, although its main use is for sluggish bowels and mild constipation.

key actions Detoxifier • Laxative
chronic skin problems Yellow dock is best used in combination with other herbs rather than on its own. It fits well in formulas that contain other “blood cleansers” such as burdock (Arctium lappa) to support bowel clearance and liver detoxification. Yellow dock is called for in conditions involving chronic toxicity, including skin disorders such as acne and boils, eczema, and psoriasis. Often the best approach is to take small amounts regularly over several months, promoting gradual but effective detoxification. Other types of chronic illness that involve poor elimination, like swollen glands and throat infection, can also benefit from the root’s cleansing activity.
other uses Yellow dock combines well with nettle (Urtica dioica) in allergic and rheumatic conditions. Both herbs also contain appreciable levels of iron and can be used as a natural iron supplement in mild cases of anemia.

Mood enhancement Due in part to an influence on serotonin and endorphin levels, cacoa induces subtle effects on the mind and emotions, increasing alertness while calming and relaxing the body. Moderate amounts of plain chocolate will enhance mood and support a positive mental state. Overall, cacoa induces a sense of well-being and, as part of a broad approach, can help to lift lowered mood, especially when linked to nervous exhaustion. Where it is difficult to maintain a moderate intake, for example, in premenstrual sugar-craving, other remedies such as damiana (Turnera diffusa) or St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) may be more appropriate.

It is an excellent remedy for children, and can be blended with some apple juice in order to improve the taste. The tea also makes a good steam inhalation to ease sinus headache and congestion. Limeflower combines well with elderflower (Sambucus nigra).
Anxiety and tension Under-appreciated, perhaps because it is a gentle-acting remedy, limeflower has constituents that exert a mild tranquilizing effect, similar in some respects to benzodiazepine tranquilizers (for example, Xanax or Valium). Usually best taken as an infusion or tincture, limeflower helps to cool and relieve anxiety states, particularly when symptoms include head and neck tension, palpitations, and feeling “hot and bothered.” Its mild action makes it valuable in helping to soothe agitation and restlessness in children, and it can also be taken to calm emotional shock, combining well here with oat straw (Avena sativa).

Arthritic and rheumatic problems Nettle’s primary use is for stiff and inflamed joints, with conditions such as gout benefiting especially. Taken long-term for arthritic and rheumatic symptoms, nettle leaf can relieve pain and inflammation and support tissue repair. A safe remedy, nettle leaf tea or soup can be taken in relatively large amounts to maximize its antiinflammatory activity. In a German clinical trial, patients with osteoarthritis were able to significantly reduce their intake of aspirin-type antiinflammatories on taking nettle leaf. High levels of histamine and serotonin in the stinging hairs are thought to be

Cystitis and urethritis Cranberry contains constituents which make it difficult for bacteria to cling to the wall of the urinary tubules and intestines so that harmful bacteria are more readily flushed out of the body. Best taken as an unsweetened juice or concentrated extract, cranberry can be combined with other fruit juices, for example apple juice, to make it more palatable. Avoid juices with large amounts of added sugar, not least because sugar depresses the immune system.

Key actions Antispasmodic • Mild
analgesic • Mild bitter • Tranquillizer
Anxiety, nervous tension Safe and nonaddictive, valerian helps in easing anxiety symptoms such as tension headache, palpitations, and tensed muscles. Take valerian on its own or in combination with herbs such as oat straw (Avena sativa) or skullcap (Scutellaria lateriflora). For nervous palpitations, combine it with limeflower (Tilia spp.). People vary in their response to valerian – some feel sedated even with a low dose, but for a few it produces a stimulant effect. Start with a low dose and build up. Valerian is usually best taken in small frequent doses through the day.

muscle cramps and pains Rheumatic pain sometimes results more from locked muscles than inflammation. Here, cramp bark can prove particularly effective, relaxing tensed muscles and opening up the circulation to clear accumulated toxins—often a key factor in pain development. As well as relieving rheumatic and arthritic problems, cramp bark’s antispasmodic action makes it a worthwhile treatment for restless legs, leg cramps, and spasmodic period pains. Take on its own to provide symptomatic relief, or combine with anti-inflammatory remedies and circulatory stimulants, such as willow bark (Salix alba) and prickly ash (Zanthoxylum spp.), for rheumatic problems such as fibromyalgia. For period pains, take the remedy before pain begins.
digestive cramps Cramp bark is effective for intestinal spasms, including irritable bowel syndrome. It
combines well with chamomile (Chamomilla recutita) for cramps
throughout the gastrointestinal tract.
Other uses Cramp bark is often included in formulations for high blood pressure, especially where tensed muscles are a feature.

Menstrual disorders The essential natural remedy to try in the case of menstrual problems, chaste berry is specifically used to aid in menstrual irregularity and premenstrual syndrome. Though not suitable for all types of menstrual disturbance, it will often help to relieve menstrual symptoms such as breast tenderness, fluid retention, headache, and premenstrual tension. If it is taken over several months, such symptoms will usually become milder and of shorter duration. Tincture or extract is usually taken on awakening in the morning, when the pituitary gland is most active. Chaste berry can be taken to treat heavy menstrual bleeding and period pains, but will work better when combined with other appropriate remedies prescribed by a qualified herbal practitioner.
Polycystic ovary disease Herbal medicine can be
very helpful in controlling or reversing this difficult problem. Although best treated professionally, self-treatment with chaste berry alone can sometimes bring about a significant improvement in symptoms. It may need to be taken for at least 3–4 months before results are seen.
