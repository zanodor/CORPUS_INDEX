PREFACE
It will soon be two hundred years since Anquetil Duperron brought
the first manuscript of the Awesta from Bombay and attempted a
translation. Sir William Jones, in his famous letter of 1771, rejected
this translation in the most sweeping way: “Si Zoroastre n’avait pas le
sens commun, il fallait le laisser dans robscurite,” and “I’Europe eclairee
n’avait nul besoin de votre Zende Vasta, vous I’avez traduit a pure
perte!” This short-sighted judgment retarded serious study for a long
while. Today we judge I’Europe eclair& differently and likewise the
great pioneer work of Anquetil Duperron.
In 1924, A. Meillet, in his Trois conferences sur les Gatha de I’Avesta,
delivered in Upsala and published by the Musee Guimet, characterized
our present attitude toward the Awesta thus: “Si Ton essaie de lire
I’Avesta, on s’aper^oit immediatement que la lecture en est impossible,
pas un chapitre ne forme une unite, pas un morceau ne se suit d’un
bout a I’autre. C’est une suite de fragments, a vrai dire, un champ de
mines . . . des mines informes ou ne se reconnait aucun ordre.” These
words are entirely true and imply that interpreting the Awesta is an
eminently archeological task. He further said: “On ne pent traduire
les gatha d’une maniere sure et complete,” all one can do is “apporter
des precisions.” This remark refers to the gatha translation by Bartholo
mae, that of the Awesta by Wolff after Bartholomae; to the gatha
translation, at that time incomplete, by Andreas and Wackernagel,
later continued by Lommel. Lommel later gave also a translation of
the yasht, and in 1929 Maria Wilkins Smith’s Studies in the Syntax of
the Gathas, together with text, translation and notes were published
in Language Dissertations, Linguistic Society of America.
Bartholomae still believed in the high antiquity and authenticity of
the Awestic text with its confusing orthography, and it was Andreas
who first saw that the Awestic script was late and that an archetype
written in Aramaic script had existed before the invention of that
script. He failed to perfect his discovery to its full import only because,
impressed by the then newly found Turfan documents, he adopted
the axiom that the “vollste Schreibung” among the countless variants
of Awestic spellings was the decisive one. The Iranian inscriptional
material shows on the contrary that the orthography was almost as



VI PREFACE
short and simple as the oldest known Aramaic. The schools of Heidel
berg and Gottingen were very much opposed to each other, but their
results resemble each other so much that Meillet could say: “Ce qui
montre que la traduction de M. Bartholomae est en general correcte,
c’est que la traduction . . . que MM. Andreas et Wackernagel ont
donnee . . . s’en ecarte seulement dans le detail. S’il reste beaucoup de
passages obscurs, on pent dire que le sens general des gatha est connu
et qu’il y a maintenant accord entre les savants qui les etudient.” Yet
the main reason for this conformity is that the translations of the
school of Gottingen but rarely depart from the significations attributed
to the roots and vocables in Bartholomae ’s Wdrterbuch.
Shortly after Meillet had formed his optimistic judgment, J. Hertel
in his various writings advanced a totally different interpretation of
the entire Awesta, which, though unacceptable in its entirety, was a
great stimulus to further research. And again another, equally dif
ferent interpretation was given in 1935 by S. Nyberg in his lectures
Die Religionen des Alien Iran, delivered like Meillet’s conferences in
Upsala, and published 1937 in Swedish, 1938 in German translation by
H. H. Schaeder. In the introduction the author says: “1935 hatte ich
bereits alle Fiiden zur Ldsung des Gatha-Problems in der Hand, aber
der springende Punkt . . . trat erst ins Blickfeld” during the printing
of the book. “Die Ldsung des Gatha-Problems bedeutet nicht weniger
als eine vollstandige Neuinterpretation der Texte,” a flattery difficult
to surpass and challenge and one which I beg the reader to have in
mind when reading the chapters here following.
When studying this latest Neuinterpretation and comparing it with
previous ones, one sees soon that it is throughout based upon Bartholo
mae’s great Iranisches Wdrterbuch, the indispensable instrument of
all our studies. But this Wdrterbuch, an amazing work, was a first
attempt made when only a small part of the now available linguistic
material was at the author’s hand, and semantics is its weakest side.
In the preface to his Infinitives avestiques Benveniste says something to
the effect that future Iranistic studies are bound to be in controversy
with the Wdrterbuch. Research has reached a phase where this only
instrument has become insufficient and where a corrected form of
Andreas’ theory of the Awestic archetype must be applied to it.
Behind this linguistic side of the problem arises that of the criticism



PREFACE Vll
of the text. Meillet said “Qui vient tirer parti d’un detail du texte ne
le peut qu’a condition d’examiner en quelle mesure la traduction du
passage considere repose sur des donnees positives et certaines.” In
fact, text cridcism of the Awesta is still as undeveloped as Biblical
criticism was in 1753 at the dme of Dr. Astruc. Though nobody can
any longer maintain the unity of the text or deny that it is “un en
semble de fragments que le hasard a conserves et que des r^acteurs
denues d’art et de pensee ont mis cote a cote sans systeme,” one goes
on translating the whole as it stands, applying text-critical schemes,
developed in editing classical authors, but unfit for this material. The
results only prove the bad condition of the transmitted text, and still
justify Sir William Jones’ sweeping judgment. Thomas Huxley once
said: “Scientific method is common sense.” Our task today is first to iso
late “dans ce champ de mines informes les fragments authentiques
dont I’interet est grand,” and then to try to put the right fragments
together.
Only after overcoming these linguistic and text-critical obstacles
can historical criticism set in. With the exception of Meillet and Hertel,
most scholars share or cannot free themselves entirely from the old be
j lief that the gatha and the so-called older Awesta belong to a remote
antiquity and to an undefined or undeterminable eastern region, the
“home of the Awesta.” For that reason they do not define the dialect
of the Awesta, but stick to the vague term “Awestic” which implies
nothing. Only Meillet accepted Tedesco’s proof that Awestic is a
Median dialect. As to the period, nobody gives an exact date. Nyberg
goes to the extreme in “stating” that “in einem Volke dem die Ge
schichte fehlt ... die ganze Frage nach der Zeit Zarathustras eigentlich
ohne Belang—without interest—ist,” a most heedless pronouncement.
’ He himself does not doubt a stratification of the Awesta, that is a rela
tive chronology, and all that is needed to convert a relative into an
absolute chronology is some synchronism. 'The gatha, though being
songs, odes, speak of real events and of acting personalities, a few of
them bearing names known also in historical sources. The legends
preserved in the yasht, too, reflect—though in legendary form—events;
they are full of names of persons, tribes, nations, places, of titles, politi
cal and social terms etc. It does not require more than defining these
things to make history out of this until then prehistoric material.



vm PREFACE
The historical criticism of the Awesta therefore must consist mainly
in the study of personal names, sociology, ethnography and topography.
I began such studies long ago, under the title Zarathustra in Archeo
logische Mitteilungen I-II. The years that passed since have brought
an unexpected addition to our knowledge of the periods and regions
in question. And looking back, I feel that in spite of a great many
errors and mistakes I was on the right road. In the following chapters
I show to what ends those earlier studies have led me.
Seven years ago. Dr. Paul Tedesco read the first draft of this book

which since underwent considerable changes—introducing a uniform
and readable transcription of the Gathic and Awestic words and texts.
I shall not, as first intended, explain the mode of transliteration which
to an Iranist will be transparent, to others of no use. In a few points
I went beyond Tedesco’s advice and so I do not want to burden him
with any responsibility, but only express my indebtedness for his help
which in many places went far beyond this trivial task, and also for his
severe criticism which made me consider and reconsider the complex
problems many times.

CONTENTS
I. CHRONOLOGY:
The traditional date, Zoroaster 258 years before Alexander; pre
served in the counting of years of a temple founded by Vistaspa;
related to the Seleucid era when this era began about 300 after
Zoroaster; worked into the older concept of a duration of the
world of 9000 years, as 3000 of the world. After interruption by
Hellenism restored under Ardashir I with shortening; Ardashir’s
accession in a.d. 226/7 = 3522 of the Sasanian world-era.
II. MEMORIAL DOCUMENT OF
YT. 13:
The so-called “community-list” is part of the foundation docu
ment of the temple dedicated in about 527 b.c. by Vistaspa to the
memory of Zoroaster; historical analogy: Ka‘ba inscription of
Shahpuhr I. Among the 240 names of the document are several
Persians and foreigners.
III. HOUSE SPITAMA :
The Spitama, a Median house, appear in the fifth century b.c.
in the business documents of Murasu Sons of Nippur, bankers
of Darius II and Parysatis, and at the same time in Ctesias. The
Spitama, chief of the clan, had married the daughter of the last
Median king, Astyages; their son Spitakes, the “young Spitama”
is Zoroaster. After the conquest of Agbatana by Cyrus in 550, the
heiress married Cyrus; their daughter Atossa was half-sister of
Zoroaster. Bagabuxsa, of the house of Vanhudatayana (Yt.13),
married to Amytis, daughter of Artaxerxes I, had a grandson
Spitama, which shows the relation by marriage between the three
families. A sgraffito “Zarathushtra” on a Median tomb.—Seals of
a late descendant “Zartuk e Spitaman, mobaS of Nihawand,”
about A.D. 500—Their country Raga, the province of mod.
Teheran.



X CONTENTS
IV. HOUSE NOTARYA:
The family of Vistaspa is called notarya, “those of the younger
line” of Achaemenids, opposed to brzyaho, “those of the elder
line.” Vistaspa’s residence vis notaranam, t5sa notaranam, mod.
Tos e Nodar near Mashhad, birthplace of Firdausi.
V. THRONE-NAMES;
In contrast to all older names, the three names of the Achae
menids, Darius, Xerxes and Artaxerxes, are religious devices of
strictly Zoroastrian character.
VI. KAVI AND XSAYA0YA:
Xsaya^a > sah is an office determined by a territory: ruler of a
province; kavi is a rank, without territory, MP. vaspuhr, “heir
of a vispati, chief of the clan.” The Median dynasty or Deiocids;
Vistaspa the notarya and the “bandva” of Zoroaster, both
Achaemenids; the Vehviya, later Geopothroi, and Zoroaster
himself as Spitama, are “kavi.”
VII. SOCIAL STRUCTURE;
Vertical organization: family—clan—tribe—nation. Horizontal:
hvetu = nobility, aryaman = clients, vastrya.fsuyant = peasants, and
slaves. The magi are clients, aryaman, but organized as “fictitious
tribe” without landed property.
VIII. HOSPITIUM:
The IE. institution is proved in Iranian by the root \' xsan = Gr.
“.xenos,” represented by Ir. xsa^ram “giving hospitality” and
“place of asylum”; xsanmane “to take asylum, become a client”;
fraxsnan “hospitality,” Gr. proxeneia. Also rada “patronus,
hospes”; mantu “patron, guardian, advocate.”
IX. HOUSE HAUGAVA:
Family of Zoroaster’s wife, the “Haugavi,” a Persian family.
Zama.aspa, chief of the clan, and Frasa.ustra, father of the



CONTENTS XI
Haugavl, at the court of Vistaspa; Frasa.aspa, Gr. Prexaspes, at
the court of Cambyses, his son Aspacina at the court of Darius.
The Haugava give the exiled Zoroaster financial help and travel
to the court of appeal of the great-king to obtain the revocation
of Zoroaster’s banishment. Damaspia, fern, of the family name,
“zamaspi,” descendant in the fifth generation of Zamaspa, marries
Artaxerxes I. The family existed still under Shahpuhr I.
X. HVARNAH:
Old mythical notion, meaning “tyche, fortuna” as early as in the
fifth century b.c., later “fortune-wealth.”
XI. BANDVA AND GRAHMA:
Bandva = “relative by marriage, brother-in-law, stepbrother”;
grahma = “favorite.” The bandva of Zoroaster is Cambyses,
the grahma of Cambyses is Gomata, the Pseudo-Smerdis. Zoro
aster was indicted under jurisdiction of his brother-in-law Cam
byses, and sentenced to proscription by the court of his home
town Raga.
XII. MAGOPHONIA;
Darius and his six companions kill Gomata. Certain passages in
the Behistun inscription are his answer to the gatha 53, 8-9.
XIII. HOUSE VEHVIYA:
On his flight from Raga to Tosa Zoroaster implores hospitium
from the kavi Vehviya, chief of the clan of (OP.) Vivana, who
refuses to receive him. The Vefigan or Geopothroi are a Persian
family invested with the government of Komis and Gurgan since
the time of Cyrus. Under the Arsacids they were rivals for the
throne of Iran. They exist still under Shahpuhr I. In the Shah
namah they are represented by Gew e Gotarzan and Vezan and Maneza.

Zoroaster drives with a two-horse team from Raga to Tosa, on a
“highway.” Organization of roads and transports in Iran since
high antiquity, perfected by Darius.
XV. POETRY: 238
Style and idiom of the gatha: they are all Zoroaster’s personal
work, he introduces himself as author. The language is no popu
lar dialect, but, like Homeric Greek, that of a traditional poetry.
XVI. “YA-AHI !” : 258
Not “crisis,” but the exclamation “hurra, triumph!”
XVII. MAGA: 265

Vnhu-agmata, NP. ;)(os-amau! and other forms of greeting.
XX. LAST JUDGMENT: 289
Zoroaster’s basic dualism of good and evil and reward after death
for deeds in life, requires the complementary notion of resurrec
tion and judgment, described like the sitting of a court. About
the saviour, sosyant.
XXI. YAM A:
The IE. mythical “twins Sleep and Death” are a metaphor for
explaining Zoroaster’s two primordial principles, good and evil,
spanta and ahra manyu. The amrta spanta as “aspects” of Ahura
Mazdah, their multiplicity as precursor of the Christian Trinity.



CONTENTS Xlll
XXII. YAMA XSETA : 320
Zoroaster chooses as example the first hero of the epics to con
demn what the Iranian epic—which is older than the Awesta
praises as fame; the same attitude as that of some early Greek
philosophers towards Homer.
XXIII. ARMATIS: 340
Originally goddess of the earth; with Zoroaster symbol of agricul
ture, peasantry, and their typical virtue: obedience, patience.
Etymology of the name.
XXIV. HARVATAT-AMRTATAT : 356
“Integrity of body and eternal life,” as aspect of AhuraMazdah.
Model of several related notions: nectar and ambrosia, etc., all
mythical projections of “water and plants” into heaven.

The word deva has nowhere the meaning “demons, devils, idols”
but only “divi, heavenly ones, gods,” of the pre-Zoroastrian,
polytheistic pantheon, condemned by Zoroaster. The religion of
the Achaemenids.
XXVI. RETURN OF THE GODS: 402
After the period of strict monotheism under the first Hystaspids,
the deva, gods, came back under a changed generic name: yazata

proclamation under Artaxerxes II.
CONTENTS OF VOLUME II
XXVII. FRAVARANI: 411
The “creed” of Yasna 12 is an archaic oath taken by the client

munion with the drugv^nt, evildoer.” Definition of terms, deva
yasna, zara^ustri, mazdayasna.”
XXVIII. MITHRA:
Pre-Zoroastrian god of social order. Several old songs collected in
his yasht can be dated in the time of immigration, about 700 b.c.,

derived some fundamental notions of his doctrine from the cult of
Mithra, transferring them to AhuraMazdah.

ZOROASTER AND HIS WORLD






I. CHRONOLOGY
“Es wird die Spur von Deinen Erdentagen, nicht in Aeonen untergehn!”
The traditional date of Zoroaster is “258 years before Alexander.”
During the last decade new material has come to light which confirms
the historicity of that number and elucidates the possibility of its tradi
tion.^
The oldest coherent notice of the theory of aeons in Iran is found in
Plutarch, de hide 47, on the authority of Theopomp, time of Alexander.
The passage, often discussed,^ runs: “According to the teaching of the
magi, each of the two gods (Oramasdes and Areimanios), in turn, rules
3,000 years and is ruled 3,000 years; then they wage war another 3,000
years and destroy each the works of the other; finally Hades succumbs,
and men shall be blissful (euSat/xoi'c?), neither needing food nor cast
ing shadow. And the god who achieved all this will rest a while and
relax.”
Although this contradicts the Iranian concept of the omnipotence of
AhuraMazdah and the restricted power of Ahramanyus—the designa
tion “god” of the Evil Spirit alone contradicts—we are not allowed to
interpret the passage differently: this was how Theopomp understood
it; it must not be right.
The theory of aeons must have suffered in its long history many
changes. The Mend/{ Xrat, Artavirdz Nama\ and the Armenian Eznik
speak equally of an aeon of 9,000 years, the Gr. Bundahishn of a “pact”
of 9,000 years granted by Hormizd to Ahriman. Ed. Meyer’s words
{Christent. 11,70): “das Abkommen zwischen AhuraMazdah und
Ahriman kennt schon Zoroaster selbst, y.30,4” rest upon an insufficient
translation of the passage (see under ‘Yama’). The theory contradicts
the one which the Gr.Bdh. carries through, of an aeon of 12,000 years,
1 Cf. AMI 11, 1930, and Orient. Studies Pavry, 1934. In bsos 3, 747-755, 1933, Jarl Charpentier gave a combination of old opinions, directed against Hertel’s Zett Zarathustras in iiqf i. Important contributions arc those of S. H. Taqizadeh in bsos 9,1 1937, Some chronol. Data
rel. to the Sasanian Period, and ib. 9, 1939, Various Eras and Calendars of Islam.—H. S. Nyberg dealt with the subject in his Religionen des Alten Iran, 1938, under headline “Die Ansicht
Herzfeld’s, Kritik an ihr.”-—Hildegard Lewy’s Calendrier Perse in Orientalia 10, 1941, appeared after the present chapter was written; where the two overlap, the results agree. There
fore, I have shortened some parts and inserted references to that treatise.—Quotation “Nyberg"
with page number in this book refer to the Religionen.

2 CHRONOLOGY
6,000 of which lie before the gumecisn, the struggle of the world’s his
tory, and one must not try to reconcile the two.
The Gathas always speak of the course of the world under the
poetical figure “apamam rvesam, the last round of the race-course,”
the last turn round the meta; yTahi!, the shout of victory at the passing
of the goal, serves for the victory of the religion. This metaphor is one
of the poetical conventions from Aryan antiquity, hence appears also
in the Veda.
But it is more than a mere metaphor, it is the same concept. Already
the tablets of Kikkuli of Mitanni, about 1380 b.c., describe the chario:s
driving nine times round the course, and at the races of Giimutrep:
near Astarabad the horses race nine rounds to the present day. Every
round is one rvesa, periodos. Hence the Aryan term in the fvi'ckuli
tablets: “navartane vaz'anasaia, in nine rounds of the race-course,”
also the name of the race-course in the Husravah legend, yr.5,50:
“nava.fra^wrsa razura, nine-rounds-forest.” The fragment of the Yama
myth in Pahl.Vid.2,i()\ “prvyahaca pasceta hazahra.zimahya (ewarsu
as, and therewith the first millennium was a flwarsah,” a finished sec
tion of the races, is taken into the Awesta from a pre-Zoroastrian
stratum of the epics. In an old passage of Yr. 13,57, the metaphor is
applied to the motion of the stars, whom the fravarti show their course:
fravazanti aSwano rvesam nasamna.
The nine rounds of the races are the origin of the nine millennia
of the world. This notion, not only pre-Zoroastrian but pre-Iranian,
is pure myth, not mixed with mystics, astronomy or theology. The
number 9 can be observed in the myths of all peoples of IE. language;
there is no contact with Babylonian ideas. The 9,000 years are a juvenile
thought: unimaginably far off.
Against Nyberg, 23, the chiliadic doctrine is not lacking in the
Gathas and in the Awesta, and the fact that the Academy heard of it
through a Chaldean pupil of Plato does not make the theory “West
Iranian” as opposed to an “East Iranian” Awesta. A. v.Gutschmid had
already recognized that the enigmatical statement of Eudoxus (407
357 “Zoroaster lived 6,000 years before the death of Plato” (347
3p!in5 N-H. 30,1, from Eudoxus and Aristotle. Also Dio-enes Laertius, prooem 2 after
Xanthus L>dus, in a report on Plato's pupil Hermodorus. Diogenes, there, ascribes a gloss of
Hermodorus to Xanthus himself.—Furtiier m a scholion to the First Alcibiades. Cf. W



CHRONOLOGY 3
B.C.), reflected somehow this Iranian doctrine. Although no tradition
can ever have put Zoroaster and Plato into chronological relation, the
words contain something genuine; they combine two thoughts: “Zoro
aster shall reappear after 6,000 years” and “Plato is an incarnation of
Zoroaster.” Eudoxus may have heard this from his Chaldean fellow
student in the following form: “The Persians say, 6,000 years after
Zoroaster a new Zoroaster shall appear, he has already appeared in
Plato.” The rationalistic Greek students calculated therefrom: Zoro
aster lived 6,000 years before Plato. It was the time when the Greeks
first heard of the high oriental antiquity and believed in astronomical
figures. This explanation which implies the Zoroastrian doctrine of the
messianic return is the only acceptable explanation of the number.
Zoroaster fitted the metaphor of the race-course and therewith the
Aryan concept of an aeon of 9,000 years into his own picture of the
world, and, in Y.43,5-6, makes AhuraMazdah stipulate at the creation
the returns men receive for their actions after the last round. He sees
the history of the world as the contest of good and evil, culminating in
the last judgment. Thereby he introduces an apocalyptic thought into
a conception that was merely mythical. Certainly he used existing
mythical elements as ethical symbols. Every thought is only a new
interpretation of an older one. The well-considered dualism and the
equation of light and good, darkness and evil, is his own, the struggle
between light and darkness itself is a mythical thought.
But neither the date of the last judgment nor the beginning of the
aeon is known. Therefore Zoroaster asks in y.48,2: “Announce to me,
AhuraMazdah, thou who knowest what will come, will the pious
conquer the impious yet before the atonement which is in Thy plan.?”
The notions of the end of the world and of the victory of the religion
are connected as in early Christianity. Only when these thoughts
become separated, after the death of the prophet, when the end of the
world recedes into increasingly indifferent remoteness, the idea of
messianic return can originate. Then, certain sayings find an eschato
logic interpretation. In the “song to the sbsyant, the saviours”*—to be
dated in the middle of the 5th century b.c., placed in Y^.i9,88f.—they

are “the sosyant and his companions,” and in a not much younger
passage inserted into Y/. 13, 128, their number is three: astvat.rta,
uxsyat.rta, and uxsyat.namah. These names are philosophical abstrac
tions. The first, derived from Gath, astvat rtam hiyatl, signifies “rtam
personified.” Thoughts including all the ethics of Zoroaster cannot be
pre-Zoroastrian. On the other hand, they are the origin of the attributes
describing the essence of the Shiite Mahdi.
G. Messina, in Orientalia i,i73ff., tried to explain the “idea di aumen
tare il numero dei succorritori” by the “divisione dell’ evo” and a
“bisogno di parallelismo,” with the effect that the “missione finale e
definitiva” was reserved for astvat.rta, while a role without “effetto
definitivo, ma solo temporario” devolved upon the others. A not-lasting
success would be a palliative word for failure, and in Yr. 19,89 the three
come together, not in intervals of a thousand years, and that seems
to me the original concept.
In the story of Prexaspes, Herodotus mentions only the name of the
main sosyant, *'Acrrvdprr]<;,^ but the name ’OfvaprTj?, OP. ‘uxsya.rta,
of a son of Darius II and brother of Artaxerxes IP shows that the
triplication of Zoroaster as sosyant was known to the Achaemenids
about 420 B.c. This does not imply that the term of their appearance
was fixed.
Already at Zoroaster’s time, the old epic tales were considered as
historical past, the length of which was likewise undetermined. In
Y.32,8, he assails the myth of Yama. This figure characterizes the first
millennium still in the latest shapes of the legend, with 76254 regnal
years. But Vid.n says (st.8): “Of the reign of Yama 300 winters [IE.
expression for year] passed .... (12-14:) 600 winters, (16:) 900 winters
passed,” and every time the earth widens, to hold the increasing im
mortal humanity. And the fragment quoted above says: “herewith the
first millennium was a 0warsah,” periodos of the race-course. As in
Y.9,10, “a thousand years,” a full millennium belonged originally to

CHRONOLOGY 5
Yama as first man and king/ The beginnings of this mythical chronol
ogy go back to the time before Zoroaster.
Eudoxus’ number “Zoroaster 6,000 years before Plato” proves that
about 400 B.c. Zoroaster had already been fitted into the original aeon
of 9,000 years as inaugurator of the fourth millennium. Thereby, begin
ning and end were fixed, and the mythical history was limited to the
first 3,000 years, a feature which the epopee preserved to the very end.
By inserting Zoroaster, at the same time, the mythical chiliadic system
became a historical chronology. Since it contains the return of the
prophet, one can call it apocalyptic, but the mythical foundation is
otherwise unchanged. In the reappearance of the saviour, the last
judgment, and the predetermination of reward and punishment it con
tains the germs of all later speculations. The old idea is clearly ex
pressed in as late a text as the Art.Vir.Nam. 18, where the tortured soul
of the sinner in hell says, “when three days and nights have elapsed:
The 9,000 years are completed, and they will not release me!”
But Eudoxus speaks already of an aeon of 12,000 years, a system in
which the place of Zoroaster would not be in 3,000, but in 6,000. The
prehistory, there, begins with 3,000, and it is evident that the 3,000
years of creation or uneventful preexistence have been put before the
9,000, in order to reconcile the two systems. The original thought is
still strong enough to prevent a reduction of the 9,000 years of history.
Every millennium has received one zodiacal sign and symbolizes a
month. This is no longer the Aryan race-course with its nine rounds,
but the Babylonian “cosmic year,” the thought of a civilization that
looked back to a long past. The zodiacal signs, registered still as late
as in the chronological chapter of the Gr.Bdh. 28SS., are an intrinsic
quality of the system. The change is the effect of the contact between
Iranian thoughts and Babylonian science during the Achaemenian
epoch." And the attempt to convert the system, still mythical and un
connected with the present at Zoroaster’s time, into a chronological
one by assigning a fixed place in it to Zoroaster is evidently another
effect of Babylonian science.
" The first man Gayamart has no place in this old system. He was introduced only by the
redaction of the epics at the Achaemenian period, reflected in Y/.s.ig and others, while Yr.i-’
agrees with the Gatha and the Videvdad. ® Not the first contact, as the study of the myths of Yama, Kanha, etc., reveal.



6 CHRONOLOGY
The system of i2,oqo years is found, for instance, in the commentary
to Vid.2.,10 (ed. Hoshjamasp 34,6ff.) : “Ahuramazdah kept this world
in a spiritual existence, menok-hastisn, for 3,000 years; for 3,000 years
he kept it in material existence, getih-hastisn, without antagonism,
apatiyarak; 3,000 years passed from the coming of the contest to the
coming of the religion; 3,000 years will pass from the coming of the
religion to the last judgment, as is written How long did the saint
creation stay in spiritual existence?”
This catechetic question cannot have stood in any old part of the
Awesta, and the exegetic answer has no authority. By making use of
this question, detached from its context, the author tries merely to
construe the much younger system into the old myth of VidevdM 2,
to which it is foreign.—This is not at all the system of Theopomp,
diough both have 12,000 years.
But the same aeon of 12,000 years is explicitly presented in the chap
ter on the disasters befalling Iran (211,5; 220 ult.) and in the
chronological chapter (238!?.) of the Gr.Bdh.^° The 3,000 years of
spiritual and 3,000 of material preexistence, put before the 6,000 years
of gumecisn, “mixture,” i.e. history of the world, are a mere doubling
of the 3,000 years with which the aeons of 9,000 and 12,000 years had
been equalized. But this entails the important change that now “his
tory” is shortened from 9,000 to 6,000 years, and that the saviour,
Zoroaster, is expected to return after 3,000 instead of 6,000 years.
This belief was dominant already at the time of Ardashir I. Den\.
b.III: “according to the religious rules more than five months shall
never be intercalated at one time,” as though this case had been known
as a singular and maximal one. And at the regulation of the calendar,
attributed to Zoroaster, but actually undertaken under Ardashir I—by
which Zoroaster shifted to the beginning of the tenth millennium
it was necessary, as H. Lewy (p.58s) has shown, to intercalate five
months, “in order that the time would come back to the point where
it was in the beginning,” viz. that the beginning of the year would fall

'li-ipa.wTai -,a.p The formula—as similar ones—introduces the text, the exegesis of which is
reported, hence is no proof for the exegesis. I'Mt was a mistake of mine when I formerly bclicicd that there were two different ways
of counting in the two chapters: the chapter on disasters neglects the transcendent 6,000 years
and counts, after the manner of the Sasanian epoch, only the “millennia of history’, hazurak

CHRONOLOGY 7
again, as at the first day of creation, on the ist Fravardin, the spring
equinox. As long as there is time, a calendar is assumed to exist, even
during the 6,000 years of preexistence of the world. But at the end of
the world time ceases, eternity is timeless. Whether the preexistence
was extended to 6,000, the return of Zoroaster reduced to 3,000 years
at that occasion or earlier, is not clear. The system of Theopomp must
not be reconciled with this one.
In Mah Fravartin, we find a different presentation. §§1-26: mythical
prehistory from creation to acception of the religion by Vistasp. §27:
Eighteen good things come in 18 years to Xusroy II Hormizdan, who
is the only historical figure in the treatise. §28: appearance of Vahram
e varzavand from India, §29; of Pisyo^an e Vistaspsah from Kangdiz,
§30: of Xvarsetar e Zartu^stan; the millennium of Zoroaster ends, that
of Xvarsetar begins. §31: Sam kills Azdahak and rules over the seven
kisvar until KaiXusroy appears, to whom he hands over the rulership.
§32; KaiXusroy rules 77 years over the kisvar with the sosyant as
mobeSan mobeS. §33: KaiXusroy commits the kingdom to Vistaspsah,
and the sosyant the mobeS-ship to his father Zartuxst. §34: Ahura
Mazdah resurrects the dead. §§35-38: annihilation of evil. §§39-47:
description of paradise.
The words of §27 “18 good things happened to Xusroy in 18 years”
furnish an exact date: the treatise is unaware of the change that came
in the 19th year, a.d. 608, the first of the 20 years of war with Hera
clius. In 629 the emperor entered Jerusalem in state, with the recon
quered cross of Christ; abu Sufyan was present and told Muhammad
about it; in 630 the Muslims took Mekka.—Xusrau died in prison.
Tabari tells of a grandee visiting the king in prison: a quince, which
the king had in his hand, fell down, rolled over the three brocade
cushions of the seat and over the three rugs interw'oven with gold, and
came to rest at last, dusty, on the floor. When the grandee picked it up,
dusted it off, and handed it back to Xusrau, the king said : “Throw it
away! When a thing shall go downward, no planning will make it
go up again; if it shall go upward, no planning is able to turn that
course. These two things come in turn, in both cases all planning is in
vain.”
Mah Frav. is composed before these events, in 6o7;'"8, that is—an
ticipating a result to be proved later—the year 904 after Zoroaster.



8 CHRONOLOGY
The treatise does not expect figures of disaster coming from the west,
but figures of happiness coming from the east. The description is full
of optimism: free from misgivings, it leaps from a happy present to
a far and happier future.
The millennium of Zoroaster is followed by that of Uxsyat.rta. As
in the Bahman yasht 7,2, this name is written hvtisytr, and since he is
called “son of Zoroaster,” the figure is mixed with hvarci^ra. The two
other saviours, uxsyat.namah and astvat.rta, are not mentioned;
hvarci^ra is the mobadan mobad of the millennium who hands over
his office, at the morning of resurrection, to his father Zoroaster. The
golden age of the heroes Sam, KayXusrau, Vistasp comes back; how
one or two thousand years were filled with it, remains obscure. This
is a picture entirely different from the one given in the Gr.Bdh. and
the Den^., which therefore was not yet generally accepted, perhaps
not yet established about a.d. 600.
In the Gr.Bdh. (2i3f. and 239f.) and in the Den\., Zoroaster is fitted
into his millennium in such a way that it begins not with his birth
but with the “matan e den, coming of religion,” or the conversion of
Vistasp, when the prophet was 30 years old.
The meaning of the thirty years is: In Y/.i4,i7 Vrthragna appears as
“nar pancadasa, man of 15 years,” in Yr.14,27 as “vira revant, mature
man, hoplite,” two shapes opposed like his appearances as colt and
stallion. The youth of 15 years, occasionally the maiden of 15 years
(Had.N.2,g), are the well known ideal figures, viro, Lat. vir, opposed
to it, is the ideal of the man of 30 years. In the eschatologic Vahman
yasht 3,17, the prince with the armies of China and India comes to
Balkh 30 years old. Christ, in Ltike 3,23 is 30 years old.“ Natural as
this number is, it is not a historical, but a mythic-schematical number.
The time between Zoroaster and Alexander is divided up, in Gr.Bdh.
239!., in the following way: “Vistaspsah, after accepting the religion,
ruled 90 years; Vahman son of Spandiyat 112 years; Humay e Vah
manduxt 30 years; Daray son of Cihrazat 12, Daray son of Daray 14
years.” The sum not mentioned is 258 years. Then follow the 14 years
of Alexander. This is the picture of the Achaemenian period of Iranian
11 Against ]ohn%s 7 - “not yet 50 years old.” Cf. Tabari 1.711: “Yahya b. Zakariyya [John
the Baptist] met ‘Isa at the Jordan, who at that time was 30 years old."



CHRONOLOGY 9
history as conceived in the epic, which clearly identified the Awestic
and the historical Vistaspa. He and the three first figures are the residue
of history in the legend; the last Daray comes from the Alexander
romance. The 258 years between Zoroaster and Alexander, hence, are
not the sum of traditional regnal dates, but these are a distribution of
the existing number 258 over the known names of kings.
The thesis is: The Gr.Bdh. puts Zoroaster 258 years before Alexander;
Biruni, athdr, interprets this rightly as 258 before the aera Alexandri.
258 is not a mythical, but a historical date, fitted into the sytem of
aeons. The problem is : how could such a date be transmitted ?
S. H. Taqizadeh, in his second article, has introduced a new point
into the discussion: in the history of Alexander in the qdnun al-masudt,
Biruni, after having discovered the difference between Alexander’s
accession and the Seleucid era, corrected the 258 years in 276 before
the era, and in his lost work “On the mistake I made regarding the
date of Alexander” he seems to have expressly apologized. Therefore
S. H. Taqizadeh follows Biruni and regards the year of the death of
Darius III, 331 b.c., as Alexander’s accession, the term of the 258 years.
But the only error in Biruni’s deduction is that he believed the Gr.Bdh.
equal to his own genius and knowledge. The Iranian tradition has
preserved neither the date of Darius’ death nor any date of Achae
menian history, and the number 258 cannot have been transmitted as
interval between any event of that history and the life of Zoroaster.
If the authors of the Gr.Bdh. had any knowledge of the era of Alexan
der, i.e. the Seleucid era at all, it began for them with the accession of
Alexander, as all later dynastic eras begin with the accession of the
ktistes. Biruni’s first interpretation in that point was perfectly right.
But the case is more complicated than it looks. Wherever Biruni con
verts dates before or after the hidjra into Zoroastrian dates by means
of the Seleucid era, he follows the Syriac, real chronology. But he
knew—as the synchronism, soon to be discussed, in his qdnun proves

that the Sasanian Persians reckoned in an entirely different way.
He can only have apologized for having made a mistake of 18 years
when converting dates, before having knowledge of the true history,
but this difference is not implied by the Zoroastrian reckoning: for



10 CHRONOLOGY
the Zoroastrian sources 258 before Alexander means 258 before the
Seleucid era. Nyberg 33, calls “gerade die Zahl 258 in hervorragendem Masse
apokalyptisch.” It rouses his suspicion that it is related to the Seleucid
era instead of the history of Alexander. In mazdayasnian tradition
Alexander’s name would always be connected with his Iranian cam
paign, especially the destruction of Persepolis. A date “before Alexan
der” would relate, in those sources, to the time where he made
Persepolis go up in smoke.
That 258 is a date relating to the Seleucid era is the point to be
proved; no era is mentioned, and 258 is only the not mentioned sum
of the unauthentic single numbers in which the interval between Zoro
aster and Alexander is divided. I believe I know all records concerning
Persepolis: in Greek tradition it occurs but rarely, mostly hidden under
the name Persai, in Iranian tradition not at all. The exact date of its
destruction—whether before or after the Indian campaign—is not
mentioned even in the surviving Greek literature. And Iranian sources
speak of Persepolis only in Muhammedan times when identifying the
mythical var of Yama with Takht i Djamshid. Iranian tradition refers no
fact by the preposition “before” to the reign of Alexander; the distinc
tion between accession and era was entirely unknown; the real mean
ing of the name “aera Alexandri” was scarcely understood by the
Greeks themselves.
The Iranians, an eminently historical nation, have never developed
any historiography. The historical knowledge the Sasanians had of the
Achaemenids came to them through belletristic literature like the
romance of Alexander or books like Esther and Daniel. But historical
tradition lingers in names like Gustasp, Vahman, Dara, Spandiyat,
Ardasir, Sasan, Humay and others. If Mithradates the Great, who, as
proved by H. Lewy, introduced the calendar in about 120 b.c., resumed
in III B.c. the title of the Achaemenids with the program of restoring
the empire, and if Ardashir I, who introduced the Sasanian calendar,
took just the coins of this Arsacid restaurator as model for his coinage,
there must have been some historical knowledge outside the literary
tradition. This is even more true for the reminiscence of facts of the
religious history.
p.34: “Dass man bei dem vollstandigen Fehlen aller einheimischer



CHRONOLOGY II
Geschichtsiiberlieferung der Jahreszahl ‘258 vor Alexander’ auch nur
die geringste Bedeutung beimessen konnte, ist ganz ausgeschlossen.”
Things so emphatically “excluded” are usually right, otherwise, why
the pathos, and, in this case, why the long discourse that the number
“nachtraglich konstruiert und in einem Augenblick riickwarts errech
net sein miisse, als man zu einem bestimmten Augenblick unter Ver
wendung der im Orient allgemein gangigen [here no longer “sus
picious”] seleukidischen Aera ankiindigte, Zarathustras Millennium
erreiche sein Ende, der Erldser werde oder sei schon erschienen.”
On their coins and the Awraman parchments the Arsacids use the
Seleucid era, although they had one of their own which they used in
Babylonia beside the Seleucid. But the Sasanians never used the “all
gemein gangige” era, because to them Alexander was the incarnation
of Ahriman, cursed wherever his name is mentioned, and it would
have been impossible to reckon by the “era of the cursed Alexander.”
On their coins they employ the traditional counting of regnal years,
but under a special form: “Fire of nn, year x,” because a new fire was
lighted at each new accession. The inscription Pers.B has “month Tir,
year 48 of Shahpuhr II, day Hormizd”; Pers.A only “month Spanda
mat, year 2 of Shahpuhr II.” The triple date of the Bishapur inscrip
tion, which had been interpreted by A. Christensen^' and corrected by
H. Lewy, runs “in the month fravartin of the year 58, year 40 of the
Ardashir fire, year 24 of the Shahpuhr fire, king of fires,”^^ that is
the year a.d. 266.—Only a little older are the signatures on the wall
paintings of the synagogue of Dura on the Euphrates, dated in various
months of the year 14 and the first of the year 15 of Shahpuhr I, hence
A.D. 256-257.
The Ka‘ba inscription of Shahpuhr I speaks (Pahl. I.17) of
the sgy’ ’trv vrhr’n, nOAAA hypeia rOYAPAGPAN, founded in the
whole empire, and then of the special purpose of the inscription, the
foundation, after the victory over Valerian, of five fires named after
the king, the queen, and three sons: “pty ln ’rv’n v p’sn’m

p‘n lnh
Ivb’n V ptn’m—Elz hmetepan mneian kai onomatoz iynthphzin,
for the memory and the perpetuation of the name [soul] of. . .

Zoroastrian, but pre-Zoroastrian, and goes back to the Median
period, when the dynastic fires were dedicated to Vrthragna as
colt and as stallion (see under ‘Deva’ and ‘Architecture’). The Gr.
Bdh. uses the term also for the fires founded by Vikaspa in the neigh
borhood of Tos, viz. aSar farnbag and aSar burzenmihr, and says
“There are many Varhran fires, every single one founded by a sover
eign, dehpat. . . . However great their number and different their
names, they are all reckoned as Varhran fires. Though many were
extinguished under the domination of the Arabs, many still exist today,
every one of them founded at the accession of a dehpat.” The expres
sion of the Bishapur inscription, “King of Fires” distinguishes the fire
of the ruling king from those of his predecessors. Darmesteter trans
lated a similar passage in the Bahman yasht “Le feu Bahman est roi,
il n’y a qu’un roi par pays,” and quoted from a Rivdyat: “the fire is
called dahyupet, every dahyu, province, shall have one only.” The
reason for the decline of the fires is the same as of the auqaf in Islam:
the ruin of their endowments caused by political vicissitudes.
Such fires founded by Cyrus and Cambyses were the OP. dyadana,
Gr. iaa-ovLa (rendering Med.*(a)yazana), which, according to Beh.
§14, the magus Gomata destroyed and Darius restored. These old fires
shall become decisive for our problem.
The date of the Bishapur inscription, confirming Noldeke’s chronol
ogy of the Sasanian period, is a.d. 266, 40 after the coronation of Ar
dashir in 226, 24 after the coronation of Shahpuhr in a.d. 242. The
date 58 relates to 208, year of the death of Volagases IV, in which,
according to the Chronicle of Arbela, began “the war of the Medes
and Persians against the Parthians.” One may call 208 the beginning of
the de facto reign of Ardashir I, but it is not the epochal year of the
dynasty, 226 according to the Syriac chronicles,^ the year in which
the last generally recognized Arsacid, Ardavan V, was killed in battle
against Ardashir. In that year Ardashir founded his fire, and this
counted 40 years since its foundation, when the fire of Shahpuhr
counted 24. The years are counted through, the fire of the founder of
a dynasty, hence, counts the years of the epoch. If temples counted
their years, the preservation of a historical date connected with the

CHRONOLOGY 13
religion is entirely possible. Assertions like “die Erhaltung ist unmdg
lich, weil es keine Aera und dem ahnliches gab” are wrong. The num
ber 258 is “preserved,” not “subsequently construed.”
The inscriptions of the Caucasus limes at Darband are at variance
with all other Sasanian inscriptions: “in the year 700.” This date looks
enigmatical, for, the Ardashir era came to an end by the Muhammedan
conquest shortly after its year 400.
It is again the great Biruni who solves the riddle. He says—a remark
often quoted—that Yazdegird I, whose first regnal year was A.n. 399
or 710 Sel., lived about 970 years after Zoroaster. In connection there
with he says, a fanatic, ibn abi Zakariya, appeared in 319 H., 1242 Sel.,
1500 p.Zor. He reached these synchronisms under the assumption—for
which he later apologized—that the traditional date of Zoroaster was
258 years before the Seleucid epochal year 31 1 b.c. If one puts in the
corrected date 329 b.c., ibn abi Zakariya is no longer 1500 p.Zor.—This
date was not a number transmitted, but calculated as a curiosity by
Biruni, and he must have given it up when correcting himself: there
is nothing remarkable in 1518. Besides, according to Sasanian reckon
ing it would be 1229 p.Zor. Nor can one infer from Biruni’s calculation
that Yazdegird believed to have come to the throne in 970 p.Zor. In
Sasanian reckoning the year a.d. 399, 173 after Ardashir’s coronation,
was not at all 970 p.Zor. The Mdh Frav. reveals the belief that in the
year 19 of Xusrau II, i.e. a.d. 608, the end of the millennium had not
yet come, though it was not far away.
Mas'udI says, tanblh qSff.: “The Persians and other nations are
greatly at variance regarding the chronology of Alexander, a fact many
people forget.” G. Messina has dealt with this subject in Orientalia I.
Mas'udi starts from a prophecy of Zoroaster, a “religious and political
secret: after 300 years the empire shall be shaken, the religion shall
remain; at the turn of the millennium empire and religion shall perish!”
On the strength of this prophecy, Ardashir—whom Mas‘udi, following
Syriac chronology, imagines to have lived about 300 + 51X, hence 8ix
(instead of 522) years after Zoroaster—is said to have shortened the
duration of the preceding Arsacid period from 500 and odd to 260
years, as it were, in order to delay the doom. This motive is naively
wrong: the faked dates could never have given to the people, from



CHRONOLOGY
14
whom the prophecy was kept a secret, the illusion that the catastrophe
was still far away. Mas'udi ends his discourse: “By the way, the proph
ecy is found at the end of Ardashir’s testament: if it was not destined
that the doom will come at the turn of the millennium . . Arda
shir’s mobad Tansar, too, mentions it in his letter to Mahgusnasp
[quotation].” In the Tansar letter as preserved in ibn Isfandiyar,
nothing is said about the shortening of the chronology. One assumes
the letter to have been composed under Xusrau I who came to the
throne according to real chronology in a.d. 530 + 31 1 Sel. + 258 Zor. =
1099 p.Zor., but according to Sasanian chronology about 250 years
earlier. Neither at the time of Ardashir nor of Xusrau I was there any
cause for a “millennium-mood,” and certainly Ardashir did not turn
back the clock of time for fear of the end of the world. Darmesteter
went rather far in saying that, from the wording of the letter, Ardashir
seemed to have inaugurated a millennium, though this was in con
tradiction to the reckoning of the Gr.Bdh. What he actually inau
gurated was the era, the calendar, and at that occasion the real
chronology was fitted into the old interrupted system of aeons.“
For all these problems a synchronism brought to light from Biruni’s
qdniin by S. H. Taqizadeh (bsos ex,i937, i33ff.) is decisive: “the cor
rection of the zi] i sahriy^an, the astronomical lists, took place in the
year 25 of Xusrau I, equal to 3851 of the Sasanian world era.” This date
does not at all fall into the time of Xusrau I if one assumes Zoroaster
as 258 years before the Seleucid era. By substituting the death of Darius
for the Seleucid era and Shahpuhr I for Xusrau I, Taqizadeh reached
approximately the 25th year of Shahpuhr. In fact, there is nothing to
be changed; it is an entirely different, shortened reckoning which
Taqizadeh indicated as possibility at the end of his discourse: the 25th
year of Xusrau I, a.d. 555, is 329 after Ardashir’s coronation in 226.
If it is 851 p.Zor., Zoroaster is placed 522 years before Ardashir’s coro
The “testament,” wasaya i Ardasir, is quoted as source in a tale in ‘Aufi’s Jawami* alhikayat, and is the unmentioned source of a chapter of the ‘Uyun al-akhbar. i**Mas‘udx’s “strict religious and political secret” contains a truth: such things belong to the
esoteric knowledge of priestly astrologers and calendarmakcrs, Aw. keta and ratugut. The
shortened reckoning entailed that for the Arsacid period there are two dating systems, represented by the total 260 in Firdausi, but 523 (or 513) in Tabari 1,711, The small numbers are those of the Iranian, the big ones those of the Syriac tradition. The early Muhammedan
chroniclers double, for the sake of compensation, the series of the Ashkan by one of Ashghan,
a theme discussed already by A. v. Gutschmid, Kleinc Schrijten ni,ii, 1861.

nation; 522 is the sum of the Zoroaster date 258 plus 264, the number
of the duration of the Arsacid domination according to the shortened
system.
The epochal year of the Zoroastrian world era is therefore 296 B.C.
or +75 Sel.
From the qanun synchronism follows that, when converting Sasa
nian dates from the Christian into Zoroastrian era, one must not add
the 14 years of Alexander. That is only logical, because the Arsacids,
as long as they used the era of Alexander, considered it to be a dynastic
era, beginning, as later their own, with the accession of the founder.
The synchronism proves definitely that the Iranians did not distin
guish between “before Alexander” and “before the Seleucid era,” and
makes unnecessary a discussion of whether the year 258 really relates
to 312/11 B.C.
When converting dates given in Christian era, one must put down
Ardashir’s accession in a.d. '226/7 258 + 264 = 522 p.Zor., hence add
522 — 226 = 296 to the dates of the Christian era. From dates in the
Seleucid era, 15 must be subtracted. As example: Yazdegird 1 came to
the throne in 399 -f- 296 = 695 after Zoroaster, and not in 970.
This does away with Nyberg’s whole discussion of the “apocalyptic
date of Zoroaster.” But he himself has furnished the documentary
confirmation for our result: he has published it, without recognizing
the importance and implications in the Darband inscriptions.^^
The mutawalli of this construction is the amarkar, i.e. Arab, ‘amil,
subgovernor of Adharbaidjan, and the most complete text contains the
date “in the year 700.” Nyberg dates the inscriptions for “paleographic,”
that means with unique documents “insufficient” reasons, in the bth-yth
centuries a.d., the period of Xusrau I and II. What then is yoo?
Xusrau I, 531-579, built a limes against the Chionites in the east (cf.
AMI ix,i49f.). Gr.Bdh.2i^: “anosakravban ^usrav e kavatan . . . avesan

the name of Yazdegird I with these buildings: “pa xvatayih e yazdkirt

The paragraph is defective in style and grammar and apparently mu

contributions were subject of diplomatic negotiations between Iran
and Byzantium.
According to their wording the inscriptions of Darband are not
foundation but restoration texts, which do not refer to the first con
struction under Shahpuhr II, but to the repairs and raisings made
under Yazdegird. He ruled a.d. 399-420, or 695-716 p.Zor.; “in the year
700,” hence is a date in Sasanian world era, in agreement with
Biruni’s qanun synchronism; 700 p.Zor. is a.d. 404, the fifth year of
Yazdegird.
Therefore, there is neither reason nor purpose “irgend ein Ereignis
aufzuweisen, das gerade damals die apokalyptische Phantasie in Bewe
gung gesetzt hatte,” as Nyberg attempts, because he believes the year
401 to be the year of the “invention” of the date of Zoroaster. But
one must go into one argument produced in this connection, in order
to do away with another error (43): the “nahezu selbverstandlichen
Zusammenhang zwischen Kalenderveranderung und Weltalterspeku
lationen.” “Bdrsenspekulationen” would be more to the point.
The event is—cf. Ndldeke’s note to Tabari 78—that under Yazdegird
the disorder of the calendar was regulated by intercalation of two
months. The year is unknown. Nyberg chooses 401 as “angemessen
fiir das grosse Schaltungsfest, eine Grossthat, die nicht schlecht zu der
megalophrosyne passt, die Prokop ihm in seinen jiingeren Jahren
nachruhmt.”
But the Sasanian calendar had to be regulated every 120 years by
intercalating one full month; every 120 years the kings would have
had megalophrosyne, and every 120 years the Sasanian “time and
milieu” would have been “gesattigt mit astrologischen Spekulationen.”
The last of these intercalations took place, according to Kusyar b.
Labban, astronomer of the loth century a.d., under Xusrau I, according
to Biruni, Chronol. 33, about 70 years before Yazdegird III, which
would be not before 562. This problem has been fully stated by H.
Lewy. But the exact date is known, for it is the very same controle of
the zij—mentioned above—in the year 25 of Xusrau I, a.d. 555 or 3851
of the world era. The years a.d. 228, 348, 468 and 588 would be the
regular leap-years. The intercalation to be expected 120 years after
that of Xusrau was prevented by the Arab conquest. Biruni remarks
that the interval between Xusrau’s intercalation and the preceding one



l 8 CHRONOLOGY
under Yazdegird exceeded the normal 120 years. There are cogent
reasons to delay or to prevent an intercalation, namely money.
Disorder of the calendar is the chronic disease of oriental chronol
ogy. In an edict (A. Ungnad, Babyl. Brief
e
n° 14) Hammurapi says:
“The year has a surplus. The new month shall be reckoned as Second
Ulul. And wherever the order has been given that the taxes shall arrive
in Babylon on the 25th of Tasrit, they shall arrive on the 25th of Ulul
II.” Ungnad remarks in maog xiii,i940, 21: “Die Schaltung hatte im
wesendichen rein praktische Griinde” and adds examples relating to
the harvest of grain, dates, fulfilment of delivery contracts etc. It is not
aeons and apocalypses that stand behind the “Schaltungsfest,” but
something that causes joy everywhere: a remission of taxes. For the
calendar rules the payment of taxes, paid at the term of the new year,
Med. nava sarda, later nauroz.^" At the Achaemenian period the term
was the midrakana, OP. bagayadis, the subject of the great tribute
processions of Persepolis. Strabo 11,14,9: “Armenia . , . sent every
year 20,000 colts for the mithrakina.” Biruni, the mathematician, was
interested only in the consequences for the chronology, but the people
of the time only in the consequences for their purses: the intercalary
months were free of taxes.
Under the Arsacids, one intercalation took place between a.d. 16
and 46, by which the Macedonian Xanthikos instead of Artemisios
became coincident with the Babylonian Nisan."”^ During the Abbasid
period I know of two such shiftings, one under al-Mutawakkil, in
245 H. “from 21. Ill to 21. rabi* i.= i8. haziran = 20. ardvihist,” i.e.
to 17. VI. 859 A.D., hence three months difference, cf. Tabari 111,1448,
ibn al-Athir vii,57. In affairs related to taxes, the Arabs use the Persian
term of payment and the Iranian solar year. The other intercalation
was under al-Mu‘tadid, from 21. iii to 21. vii, hence four months, cf.
Taghriberdi 1,93 and A. v. Kremer, Culturgesch. The calendar
can only be corrected when the financial situation is a good one and
when people think less than ever of the end of the world. Nyberg:
“Mit allem Vorbehalt hinsichtlich der Einzelheiten glaube ich also die
Legends concerning the institution of nauroz are often quoted, e.g. that in the Mdk. Frair.; only one has attracted but little attention, viz. that in Yaq.1,669, story of the mobed of Kaskar,

CHRONOLOGY 19
Zahl 258 deuten zu konnen als einen integrierenden Bestandteil der
Zarathustxa-Apokalypse ... in Zusammenhang mit Yazdegird’s grosser
Schaltung entstanden. . . . Die Zahl ist von gewisser Bedeutung fiir
die Geschichte der sasanidischen Theologie. Mit dem geschichtlichen
Zarathustra hat sie nichts zu schaBen.” This is a verdict, but a
“dusr^ris, miscarriage of justice.” Under Yazdegird, 699-717, p.Zor.,
when the finances permitted a great intercalation, this number has not
been invented, it has not been computed at all.
In his discourse, Nyberg takes 288 as original number and 258 as
arrived at by subtracting 30 years of life. He overlooked that 288 would
be 600 B.C., a round mystical number. Theodorus bar Koni, end of the
8th century a.d., puts the birth of Zoroaster 628 years 7 months before
the birth of Christ. That is a number transmitted by prophetic,
apocalyptic literature, of the type of the Zoroastrian prophecy about
Christ in the Boo\ of the Bee, ed. Budge, transl.p.9. Any connection
with the birth of Christ cannot be older than the 5th century a.d., and
it is not possible that the Zoroastrian tradition had obtained its number
258 from a Christian source by the calculation 600 — 30 — 312 = 258.
The number 258 in the Zoroastrian sources is only the not mentioned
sum of years between Zoroaster and Alexander, and the idea of separat
ing birth and public appearance by 30 years, following a mythical
pattern, is an interpretation of the primary number 258 which did
not distinguish between the two points of time. 258 + 30 + 312 = 600
is a coincidence; 258+311 = 569 b.c. is authentic.
There is still a trace of another reckoning. According to Firdausi,
Vullers 111,1499, Zoroaster had planted in memory of the conversion of
Vistaspa, a cypress, in front of the fire-temple of Kishmar, district
Turshiz in Khurasan, inscribing on its stem “Gustasp has accepted the
Good Religion.” According to the Dahistan (transl. Shea and Troyer
1,306-309) al-Mutawakkil had cut down the cypress in 232 H., for use
in the Dja‘fari palace, at Dja'fariyya, North-Samarra, when the tree
was 1,450 years old. The caliph was murdered when the transport had
reached the last stage before Samarra." I have seen, in Iran and

Afghanistan, many cypresses 500 years old, and in Northern Europe
yews of almost a thousand years. The age is possible. The Muham
medan tradition does not record this act of al-Mutawakkil, but contains
reports that make it all but probable. In 235 H. the caliph issued an
edict against the ahl al-dhimma, including Zoroastrians, in which the
pulling down of all recently built sanctuaries was ordered; in 239 H.
the edict was repeated in severer form. In 241 he incorporated e.g. the
old cathedral of Hims into the Gr. Mosque there. But the order to
build the Dja‘fari palace was given only in 245 H.; the construction
lasted no more than a couple of months, and on the new-year of 246
(8. 111.860) the caliph moved into the new town; he was murdered on
the 4th of shawwal 247 (ii. xii.861). The order to fell the cypress was
not given before 245, and the execution and the transport may well
have taken all that time. The date cannot be 232, year of al-Mutawak
kil’s succession, but only 245 H., i.e. January-March a.d. 860, 1172 Sel.“
The 1,450 years of the cypress are the sum of 1,172 + 278. This number
is between 288 for Zoroaster’s birth and 258 for the conversion of
Vistaspa, but at the bottom of this reckoning is nothing but the same
tradition: Zoroaster 258 years before the Seleucid era. It is inadmissible
to reconcile the dates by assuming a reckoning in lunar years, not only
because the Iranians never used them, but—a decisive point—because
this system is not that of the Sasanian world era, in which the cypress,
in the year 232 H. would have been 1,145, in 245 H. 1,158 years old. The
small fault is not in 278 for 258, but in 1172: it is a counting of real
years which equals 245 H. with 1192 instead of 1172 Sel., under the
same presumption: “Zoroaster —258 Sel.” The computation cannot
have been: 258 years before 331, death of Darius III, plus 20 years
(epochal year of the Sel. era), plus 1172=1450, for the interval of 20
years between the death of Darius and the epochal year was as un
known as the two facts themselves. On the contrary, the Seleucid era
was used in Khurasan, since the Arsacid calendar, in Seleucid era,
introduced by Mithradates II about 120 b.c., remained in use in
Khwarizm down to 1270 Sel. The number 258, here, appears in the

CHRONOLOGY 21
reckoning of the years of a temple, without the reduction peculiar to
the Sasanian world era.
The year looo of this era is equal to a.d. 704. In 635 (931 p.Zor.)
the Muslims conquered Ctesiphon; 642 (938 Z.) or little later was the
battle of Nihawand; 674-676 (970-972 Z.) were the first advances against
Bukhara and Samarkand, regions which were finally conquered in
711 (1007). That is the time in which the Bahman yasht 1,5 and 11,21
puts the end of the millennium, and Mdh Frav. is still a hundred years
away from this end. At this time, hence, Zoroaster’s prophecy ex eventu
in Mas'udi was conceived."^ The same thoughts lead to the emigration
of the Parsis into India, as K. Inostrantzev has shown."°
At the very same time the system of aeons, preserved in the Gr.Bdh.,
received its pessimistic-eschatologic character. The prophecy talked of
the downfall of the empire and the religion; here it becomes practically
the end of the world, by reserving the following two millennia for its
preparation by the two precursors of the third sosyant. This picture is
most unconvincing; why should one need an aeon of 12,000 years,
when 6,000 years are wasted on a preexistence, 3,000 on mythical his
tory, and 2,000 on preparing the end, so that human history is actually
limited to one thousand years } In this system nothing is alive of Zoro
aster’s optimism, the final victory of Good over Evil, which can yet be
felt in Mdh Frav. It is a new interpretation of the old doctrine, born
out of the time of calamity, the Muhammedan conquest, out of the
passionate hope for the end of the world expected to come at once, and
out of the equally passionate belief in the old doctrine: “The kingdom
of Heaven is near!”
A similar case: R. Hartmann, Etne islam. Apokylypse der Kreuzzngszeit, Schritten d. Konigsbcrg. Gelehrt. Gesellschaft 1,3, 1924. Journ. Cama Orient. Inst. Bombay, i. 1922, 32-69: J. J. Modi, A Few Ei ent^ in the Ea,ly Hist, of the Parsis, Bombay 1903, 1-9. According lo the Qissa i Sanian, the Iranians who faithfully adhered to Zoroastrism took refuge in Kohistan, between Khurasan and Kirman, after Yazdegird’s death in a.d. 651=947 p-Zor. A hundred years after, about 751, they moved to Hormuz on the Gulf, where they stayed till 765=1061 p.Zor. In the \ear of the foundation of Baghdad, they emigrated to Diw, and landed, 19 years later, in 784 = 1081 p.Zor. in Gujerat “guided by astrological prognostics.” The waiting sojourn in Kohistan, hence,
lasted from — 50 to “h 50 of the millennium, to the downfaU or the Uma\yad d> nasty.
In this, a second prophecy concurs: a dream of Yazdegird ill, after the defeat at Jalula in A.D, 637/8 = 933/4 p. 2x>r., told by Tabari: “The Arabs shall rule icuj 100 too “h .

years.” There the dream stops short. The year of the foundation of Baghdad brought the last
disillusion.



22 CHRONOLOGY
But Zoroaster’s date, “258 before Alexander” is not affected by such
thoughts and changes, and survives all of them untouched.
The resolution of these 258 years into regnal years of legendary
Achaemenids can scarcely have been undertaken before Ardashir I.
In Shahr.Er. §i we read: “Alexander burnt the Denkart (=Awesta)
written by order of Vistasp, which had existed under seven kings.”
A gloss explains the number of seven—recorded nowhere else—as
seven mythical kings before Vistasp, against all logic. The seven is a
vague remembrance of the fact that there were seven Hystaspids. The
archetype of the Shahrihd e Erdn was composed for Kavat, at the very
end of the 5th century, and must have used an old form of the chiliadic
system which contained “3,000 years prehistory, appearance of Zoro
aster, seven kings reigning 258 years, Alexander 14 years.” The scholars
of Ardashir’s time—if this filling of the gap in the Bdh. is theirs
could find out for the seven only five kings in the legendary material.
Zoroaster himself stands at the beginning of the Achaemenid epoch,
the Arsacids do not get more than half of their real domination, only
a few years more than the Achaemenids, and only with the Sasanids
real chronology begins.
The number 258 predicates when the prophet lived, and such facts
are not quickly forgotten by oriental nations, even when illiterate. It
appears in a system of aeons and those who were in charge of it must
have been the people that preserved the memory. The date known to
Plato’s Academy, “Zoroaster 6,000 years before Plato,” shows that al
ready about 400 B.c. Zoroaster had his place as inaugurator of the 4th
millennium in that system, and that his return was expected after
6,000 years.
With this insertion of Zoroaster into the system and the limitation
of the prehistory to the first 3,000 years, the chiliadic system had
been converted into real chronology. The system requires the counting
of years. Quintus Curtius 111,3,9 says, speaking of Alexander’s time:
“The magi had a year of 365 days,” viz. beside the civil calendar. As
in the Sasanian period, this was certainly connected with the system of
aeons.
One instance of priests counting the years of their temple in
antiquity, just as in Sasanian times, we have come to know in the



CHRONOLOGY 23
“era of the cypress.” Another one is the number preserved by Herod
otus 1,130 in the Median story of Harpagos: “Cyrus dethroned Asty
ages after 35 years of his reign, after 128 years of the Median rule,
Trape^ ^ ocrov oi Sicvdai ^pxov, not counting the years of the Scythian
domination.” The double date is in the style of the Bishapur inscrip
tion; “year 58, year 40 of the Ardashlr-fire, 24 of the Shahpuhr-fire.”
The number 128 comes from a Median source (Harpagos is a Mede)
and contradicts the artificial calculation followed by Herodotus in
1,102-106; “Deiokes 52 years, Phraortes 23; Kyaxares 40, crvv tolctl
Xfcvdai '^p^av, including the 28 years of the Scythians; Astyages 35
years,” sum lY. ’j'^ = 150, which would give 122 without the Scy
thians. With the words nape^ Herodotus tries to reconcile the variance
of his two sources, but the 128 years were not meant to be interrupted
by a span of 28 years. 150 is wrong, 128 is right. The end is the con
quest of Agbatana in 550 b.c., Agbatana is the home of the record. In
Agbatana stood the memorial fire of the Median ktistes, the aSar
kavatakan, which burned as long as the dynasty lasted. Its priests
counted 128 years of their temple, 35 of the Astyages fire, when Cyrus
took Agbatana. The Ardashir fire, too, burned as long as the Sasanian
dynasty lasted: Yazdegird III was crowned in this temple in a.d. 632/3
(406 p.Ard., 928 p.Zor.); its priests counted 40 years of their temple
when the statue of Shahpuhr I was made in Bishapur; the priests of
Kishmar counted 1,450 years when their cypress was felled.
The disturbed condition in which the chiliadic system is preserved
in the Gr.Bdh. is explained by the facts that the years were counted
before Alexander, that Hellenism led to an interruption, and that under
Ardashir the gap was filled by calendaric-astronomical methods

whereby the strange shortening occurred.
The number 258 appears as interval between Zoroaster’s epiphany,
the “matan e den,” and Alexander’s accession, which was not preserved
as a date by the Iranian tradition. One did not know that the Seleucid
era was something different. The calendar-makers of Ardashir I, in
bringing down the epochal year of the Zoroastrian era from 569 to
296 B.C., bring down with it the year 258 p.Zor. from 31 1 to 38 b.c.
as epochal year of the Seleucid era, without changing its signification.



24 CHRONOLOGY
This first dynastic era"® has not been introduced as such. Seleucus
counted, as usual, the years of his reign, beginning with the year in
which Alexander IV was defeated and murdered, and in which
Seleucus returned to Babylon. The epochal year is 312 Ti; the varia
tions of its beginning, i. x.312 in the west, i. 111.311 in the east, do not
affect the problem of its origin. During Seleucus’ last years, Antiochus
I was co-regent with the full royal title. Seleucus’ death, 32 Sel. = 28o
B.C., did not entail a change of protocol, and under Antiochus whose
first year had never counted as year i, one simply went on counting
the years of Seleucus. In course of time, one must have realized that
this was a new practical method, with the effect that Antiochus II in
51 Sel. = 26i B.c. consciously went on doing the same. Thus the first
dynastic era originated. As a whole and in its varieties it received vari
ous names, like “Seleucid, of the Greeks, of the Babylonian astron
omers,” but all of them are subsequently given, among them “aera
Alexandri” and dvro Trj<; ’AXe^dvSpov TeXevTrj^. It seems to me impos
sible that this last name could mean the era of Alexander IV, just as
impossible as an era of the “cursed Alexander” with the Sasanians. The
name supposes the belief that the era, the beginning of which was
obscure, had been used since the death of Alexander.
“Zoroaster 258 years before Alexander” is an expression that can
result only from “258 years before our era.” The Seleucid era was used
by the Arsacids in Iran, where, of course, it passed as era of Alexander
the Great. In the year 65 of this era, the Arsacids introduced their own
dynastic era, which in Babylon was never used alone, but at the side
of the Seleucid. The Sasanians, with their xenophobe tendencies, aban
doned it, just as they renounced the title philhellen, and the occasion
was the reform of the calendar under Ardashir I, a.d. 227/8, 539/40
Sel.
According to that old reckoning, the year 300 p.Zor. falls in the
reign of Antiochus I, when people became aware of having an era.
300 p.Zor. would be 42 Sel, 270 b.c. Fifty years earlier Curtius attests
the existence of a religious calendar, and 247 b.c. is the epochal year
of the Arsacid era. Only as early as that, in about 300 p.Zor., hence
in pre-Arsacid antiquity, the number 258 could be introduced into the
chiliadic system. Under the dissolving influences of Hellenism, the

CHRONOLOGY 25
counting of years stopped, but this fundamental number, the interval
between Zoroaster and the Seleucid era remained. New materials allow
us also to recognize how and where it was preserved.
The great temples counted their years, and one of them was the tem
ple where the foundation-document was kept with the memorial list
of Yasht 13, a document to be discussed in our next chapter. A headline
calls this list “fravartayo of the purvyatkesa and nabanazdika, souls
of the first-faithful and next-of-kin,” namely of Zoroaster and Vistaspa,
and the fact that Zoroaster and his family precede Vistaspa and his
relatives shows that the temple was founded by Vistaspa “for the soul
of Zoroaster and for his own soul.” The list of names is the last para
graph of the entire document, and was introduced into the yasht at the
time of its first redaction, that means about 400 b.c. The priests who
kept this document and recited the names by heart when celebrating
the prescribed masses, counted the years of their temple and knew, at
the time of Antiochus I, that Zoroaster had lived 300 years before.
Only the list of names is preserved, and only the discovery of names
historically known among them can furnish means of dating the docu
ment. I anticipate here some results to be proved in the following
chapters.
Among the sons of Vistaspa appears Spantadata, who at his acces
sion to the throne assumed the “throne-name” Darayavahus. That
gives the terminus ante quern: before 522 b.c. A terminus post quem,
with rather large margin, is 539, the year in which Cambyses was sar
Babili and not yet lieutenant in Iran. The proscription of Zoroaster
from Raga may have taken place already in 538. In the list he has three
wives, one of them the Haugavl whom he married in exile, and by her
he has a daughter, Purucista, unmarried, hence not yet 16 years old.
Some years must have passed between his banishment, the marriage,
and the birth of the daughter. He has already a grandson bearing the
same name as his son Rvatatnara (probably the second son), hence
must have been at least 40 years old.—If 569 is the year of his birth,
the terminus post quem would be 529, year of Cambyses’ accession.
Finally, Brzi.rstis = Brzya, Smerdis, appears in the list.
According to Herodotus 111,65, Cambyses would have ordered
Prexaspes to have Smerdis killed in prison, after the Egyptian cam

paign had started; when he received the news of the proclamation of
the Pseudo-Smerdis the king at once returned. Herodotus tells the
Prexaspes story during that return, and speaks wrongly of a non
existing “Syrian Agbatana,” product of a banal interpretation of the
oracle of Buto : Cambyses killed himself in the real Agbatana. Thus it
is possible that the date of Smerdis’ death was nearer to 523, but the
greater probability is that he was killed when Cambyses started for
Egypt. A list “for the souls, the memory” may contain names of
deceased persons, as does the list in the Ka‘ba inscription of Shahpuhr
I, but the first assumption would be that Smerdis was still alive when
his name was put into the list. In that case, 525 is the terminus ante
quern—a year in which Purucista was not over 12 years old, and the
probable date of the memorial list of Y/.13 is limited between 528
and 526 B.c.
If the temple was founded in 527, it counted exactly 258 years in
the year 300 p.Zor. (258 before Alexander plus 311 = 569 b.c. or 42
Sel.), the time when the Seleucid era had become established under
Antiochos I. At that time the priests could say: “Remarkable that the
year 300 of Zoroaster, who was born 258 years before the era we now
use, is exactly the year 258 of our temple.” This number is a tradition,
not a calculation. It does not affect our problem, but one may infer
from the preservation of this date that such temples, at the time of
Antiochus I, started to use two eras, as did the Arsacids a few years
later.
The number 258 is a historical reminiscence, introduced into the
chiliadic system at the Seleucid period and faithfully preserved to the
end. No more than the date for the birth of Christ is it a historical
date in the strictest sense, for the notion “petakih, epiphany” is a too
indefinite one.'" The birth of a prophet—since the child is not born
with its work accomplished—can never be exactly retained; the first
public appearance, the success of which manifests itself only much
later, is remembered only in rare cases. But that does not matter. The
Like Or. epiphania and Arab, zuhur, the word is used for apjiearance of stars, cf. the Syr. n.pr. Iso'denah “Christ has risen!”, and Gr. cpiphanes in royal protocols. In Hellenism, Ptolemy V, 190 B.c., is the first “epiphanes, the god who appears to men in calamity”;
then .Antiochus IV, 175-164.—In Iran Xusrau I uses the title. In Islam, there are many malik al-zahir; the tide has an Intense meaning in the case of the Fatimid caliph al-Zahir, who followed, as a child, his father al-Hakim after his disappearance, ghaiba.

late Awestic concept, expressed e.g. in yr.i3,93£., is, that “all waters,
plants and animals of the good creation rejoice at the birth and shout:
Thank God! the priest is born, he who is the Spitama Zarathustra!”
The Pahl. commentary to (on Raga) likewise makes no dis
tinction between birth and appearance: some codd. have “zrtvst mn
ZK y’k YHWN.t, Zoroaster was from that place (meaning: born),”
another ms. has “pyt’k YHWN.t, appeared from there,” same meaning.
It is not only that the birth is the more naive and original conception

cf. the legends emanating from the birth of Christ—and that the ap
pearance with 30 years is a legendary, though probable, pattern. The deci
sive point is that the name “matan e den” or “acceptance of the
religion” is a religious term which must of necessity be later than the
fixing of the era. The distinction between birth and appearance is sec
ondary. The analogy to “appearance” would be, in Christianity, the
Jordan baptism as epochal year. From the historical point of view,
there has never been a year, day or hour, in which Vikaspa became
converted. This is a religious tint laid on events entirely neutral. What
actually happened was that Vistaspa gave refuge to the proscribed
Zoroaster. Such an act was not announced with trumpets, but kept
as secret as possible. It seems that, at first, Zoroaster lived in conceal
ment as a hermit at the farthest corner of Vistaspa’s province, on the
mount Usidam in the lake Kansavya. At any rate, the exact date of
his reception by Vistaspa has been no more preserved than the date
of his birth. The only real date known in later times was the founda
tion of the temple; this was attested by the document, to which the
memorial list belonged. In that temple the number 258 was preserved.
The birth date allows forthwith a margin of ± 10 years. But in
agreement with all that can be gathered about the prophet’s lifetime
from the Gathas and the rest of the Awesta, it puts Zoroaster in the
sixth century, about 570-500 b.c., and the time of his activity under the
reigns of Cyrus, Cambyses, and Darius.
In UGE n,2ioff. (1905) J. Markwart had calculated the years 489-486

magi would have induced the non-Zoroastrian Xerxes to introduce a
calendar of Zoroastrian coloring in order to give the king in the Zoro
astrian deva-notion a weapon against a revolt in Babylon! The Baby
lonians use, before and after, their own religious calendar without
noticing the coloring of the names of the months used in Iran. The
revolt is imaginary, and Xerxes never introduced this “mazdayasnian
calendar.” The last point is proved by the cuneiform tablets from
Persepolis which use, throughout, the Old Persian calendar. The
reasons adduced by Poebel in his first report on these tablets, for dating
them in the time of Artaxerxes I, were unconvincing and have now
been revoked in Cameron’s notice Darius' Daughter:"^ the 30,000
tablets of the wall-archives are all from the time of Darius, years 12-28,
the 800 tablets from the “Communs archives” go from the 30th year
of Darius to the beginning of Artaxerxes’ reign. Down to about 460 the
Old Persian calendar was used and the officials were magi. H.
Lewy remarks as to the number 485: “Cette erreur s’explique du fait,
que M. Nyberg ignorait la reforme d’Ardashir et la difference fonda
mentale entre les calendriers sasanide et pre-sasanide.” Of the various
theories about the date at which the mazdayasnian calendar was in
troduced, it is only what Taqizadeh calls “the second reform” about
441 B.c. that has a chance to be true. Obviously this reform is mazdayas
nian, not Zoroastrian,^ and we shall see at the same time the maz
dayasnian redaction of the Awesta took place.
In “stating” that “in einem Volk dem die Geschichte fehlt,” “die
ganze Frage nach der Zeit Zarathustras . . . eigentlich ohne Belang
ist, dass der rein chronologischen Frage hier die Bedeutsamkeit fehlt,”
Nyberg confounds “history” and “historiography”; that is what is

them in Aramaic, written in ink, the others in Elamite cuneiform. Only preliminary information has been published, on the strength of which Nyberg says p.15: “Merkwiirdigcrweise scheint das Elamische die eigentliche Sprache der .Achaemeniden zu sein”; p.334: “Wir wissen ietzt, dass die Verwaltungssprache der .HItcren Achaemeniden hauptsichlich elamisch war,"

lacking, not history. And the definition of the time of Zoroaster re
mains the central problem of Old Iranian history, history of religion,
archeology and philology.
There is a historical criterion for the value of the traditional date,
6th century b.c.—In his Christenttim 11,17, Eduard Meyer argues : “Der
zweihundertjahrige Bestand des Perserreichs ist ein Wendepunkt fiir
die gesamte Religionsgeschichte iiberhaupt. Die nationale Gestaltung
des staatlichen Lebens ist fiir westorientalische Welt begraben, damit
die Religion von Staat und Politik gelost. Das schafft den Individual
ismus und den Universalismus, die fortan den Grundzug aller Reli
gionen bilden. Aufgabe der Gottheit ist jetzt nicht mehr, das einzelne
Gemeinwesen, den auf besonderem Volkstum beruhenden Staat zu
schirmen, sondern sie ist zu einer universalen, kosmischen Macht
geworden, die sich nicht mehr an das Volk als ganzes, sondern an
den einzelnen Menschen wendet. In den arischen Religionen treten
diese Ziige von Anfang an hervor.”
What he says about the significance of the Persian Empire for the
religious development of mankind is entirely true. He was one of the
most passionate champions of the concept of the high antiquity of
Zoroaster. I discussed the problem with him more than once, the last
time a few days before his death, but I do not know what he meant by
“von Anfang an,” Zoroaster or still older phases? The gods of the
Aryans in India fight for their worshippers, and in the pre-Zoroastrian
passages of the yashts, the gods grant to the worshipping Iranians what
they refuse to the worshipping enemies of the heroes: naive and with
out a trace of ethics, entirely Homeric. The ritualism, too, the
sacrificial and magic rites of the Old Iranian religion, against which
Zoroaster fights like the prophets of the Old Testament, do not surpass
the level of religious thought reached elsewhere.
Only the book of Job (about the end of the 5th century b.c.?) comes
near to the universal monotheism of Zoroaster with his ethical dualism

i.e. the answer to the question : whence comes evil, if God is good ?
and with his complementary thought of eternal reward and punish
ment for the individual. There is a contradiction in the assumption
that thoughts, which became possible in the rest of the world only
under the Persian Empire, were possible 500-700 years earlier in the
Aryan world. In Iran too, the universal conception of the deity, the



CHRONOLOGY
30
relation of the god to the individual man instead of to the group,
and the replacing, connected therewith, of the cult hy ethics, is only a
consequence of the world-wide empire.
In Christentum 11,69, Eduard Meyer considers the passage in Plu
tarch, de hide 47 (frgm.72) on the paradisiac condition after the defeat
of Evil, Areimanios, where “all men, as fxaKdpioi, shall be one politeia,
and shall all speak one language,” to be genuinely Zoroastrian, perhaps
made known to the Greeks by Aristotle’s pupil Eudemus. But how
could, about or before 1000 b .c., in the unhistorical region beyond Iran
proper, such a notion be possible which clearly is the ideal all but
materialized by the polyglot Persian Empire ?, the ^sa^ram vispazanam,
paruzanam, Akk. sa naphar lisanu gabbi “where all languages are
spoken.”
The true cognition that the Persian Empire is the turning point in
the history of all religions and brings the katharsis of religion itself
makes a higher antiquity for Zoroaster from the beginning impossible.
Starting on entirely different lines, Meillet came to a similar conclusion,
Trots Conf. p.22: “La reforme religieuse . . . suppose de grands mouve
ments historiques et sociaux. L’etablissement d’un vaste empire, gou
verne par un roi absolu, a ete dans le monde indo-iranien un fait d’un
type nouveau; il est sans doute resulte de ces memes mouvements aux
quels est due la secte Zoroastrienne. Ce fait capital domine la question.”
The decades of the foundation of the Persian Empire in the 6th
century b.c. are a terminus ad quem for Zoroaster. The allegedly “only
safe term, before 485” is a mistake, inferred from wrong premises, and
the traditional date, Zoroaster appeared 258 years before the Seleucid
era, which determines his life between 570 and 500 b.c., is an intrin
sically probable date.

“tyam imesam martiyanam tohma hubrtam paribara, the issue of these men treat well!”
The headline of the Fravardin Yasht is: “We worship the fravarti of
the blessed first-followers of the law, rtavan purvya.tkesa, next-of-kin,
naba.nazdista.”^ This headline, unfit for the main part of the yasht,"
refers only to its smaller second half, §§87-145, the so-called “Com
munity-list.”
Already a cursory glance at that list, as it stands, reveals that instead
of being a catalogue of the first followers only and the next-of-kin
of Zoroaster and Vistaspa, it is rather, as §145 expresses, a list of “the
fravarti of the whole world from the first man Gayamart to the last,
the saviour, sosyant.” Even the fravarti of many animal species and
other beings of the “good creation” are added. The original list of the
community, thus, has been expanded to a list of humanity. This was
done when introducing the document into the yasht, after the persons
mentioned were all deceased “souls,” and, since some of them belong
to a third generation, at the earliest, three generations after Vistaspa,
i.e. after the—strictly speaking—“Zoroastrian” period, at the period of
Mazdai'sm.*
Various materials were used for this expansion. In §§131-135, the
mythical kings are inserted between the personal names of the genuine
list; in §§136-138, a series of mythical heroes. The first of the kings and
men is Yama, not Gayamart (of §145). The divergence shows that the
filling material belongs to different periods. Hosyanha is not yet one
of the kings, as in other yashts, but ranges with the heroes in the next
paragraphs. All other yashts present already the system surviving in
Firdausi’s form of the Shahnamah, where Hosyanha, the Saka, opens
the line of kings. Thus, the redactors of y/.i3 have preserved an archaic
version of the epics, not affected by a redaction that was undertaken
probably at the early Achaemenian period.^

alleged Aral-Lake is the ocean, but neither this nor any local or geo
graphical name appears in Y/.13, which is a “Lied ohne Orte.” It
contains the names of all kings and heroes, to the last, Vistaspa, the
only member of the Urgemeinde among them. But they no longer
“group themselves,” for they are all dead, “fravarti, manes,” and their
“historical milieu” is according to §23 “tusnisad, the land of silence.
Hades.”
The sosyant Astvat.rta, twice inserted at the end of §§iio and 117,
and the three sosyant in §128, and the whole §129 on Astvat.rta, belong
no more to the first-followers and next-of-kin than do those kings and
heroes, neither the preceding six names of the krsvar-iudices, two of
which appear again in §121. Also the last three names, compounds in
-fSri, of the list of women in §141 must be eliminated.
That means at the same time that everything which goes beyond
the list proper is a commentary added when or after the list was in
serted into Y/.13. Thus §§88-94 about Zoroaster, with exception of the
name of his cousin MaSyomaha, but including the glosses referring to
him; the remark on the “apostle” Sena Ahumstut in §97; the verses
§§97-100 on kavi Vistaspa; those on the use of the name of the Hau
gava for magic purpose at the end of §104; a remark about
Man^ravaka in §105; a note to Arsya, father of Vanhu; at last §120,
on the magic effect of the name of Yavista Friyana. At the best, some
of these glosses show what the late Achaemenian Mazdaism thought
about these figures.
After all these eliminations there remains an astonishingly well
preserved list of probably exactly 240 names, 24 of them names of
women. Of the male names sixteen are characterized, in §§125-126, as
foreigners. Upon them three children follow, bearing the same name
as their grandfathers with an “aparazata, junior” added to it, and
finally—not separated, as today, by the first kings and heroes—a list
of women in §§139-141.
The only possible origin of this list is an authentic document of that
high antiquity. Whatever one may think of the time and place of
Zoroaster, this list which must go back to his own time is the rest
of a document and must have had a purpose. Only when recognizing



33
MEMORIAL DOCUMENT OF YT.I3
that purpose can one give it its true historical value. H. H. Schaeder,
in a letter, once compared it to the lists in Ezra 2 and Nehemiah 7,
preserved by a fortunate chance. Those—almost contemporary—lists,
too, represent documents and had a purpose, namely for administra
tion. The mere existence of the list of Yr.13 ought always to have been
a warning not to put Zoroaster into a period long before the known
Iranian history. But if the list belongs to an early historical period, the
original document could be written only in cuneiform, for one cannot
assume Aramaic script on clay tablets or leather for Old Persian texts
before Darius, on account of

The introduction of Aramaic script made cuneiform soon go out
of use, and the list of Yr.13 must have been transmitted by word of
mouth only for at least 600 years, until it was first written down in
Aramaic script together with the whole Awesta, unless one would
assume that, at the time of Darius, an aide-memoire had been noted
in Aramaic. The names as we have them show clear traces of being
based on a text in Aramaic script.
On the Ka‘ba i Zardust, a tomb-tower in front of the Royal Tombs
and the sculpture of Shahpuhr I at Naqsh i Rustam, is a trilingual
inscription of Shahpuhr, which solves the riddle of the list of y/.i3,
and that is the importance, far surpassing its historical contents, of
that inscription.
In the style of Assyrian foundation documents, thousand and more
years older, in which likewise a long historical introduction occupies
most of the space and the proper purpose is confined to the very last
lines, the preface of Shahpuhr’s inscription is a detailed account of his
victorious campaign against Valerian, which is symbolized in the
triumphal sculpture opposite the Ka‘ba. Only the middle lines, 21-23,
deal with the special purpose, the foundation of five memorial fires.

is a link between the Elamite and the Sasanian lists, and establishes a
tradition over more than 2,000 years. Shahpuhr’s list has 135 names,
mostly of men, but thirteen ladies of the royal house and a few little
girls are among them. The arrangement is (i) some ancestors in
straight line, beginning with Sasan ^vatay, some more living members
of the narrowest family, still more younger members, among them
children with hypocoristic names, the future. Upon which follow in
historical order the great number (2) of “those that were under Papak
Sah,” (3) “under Artaxsir sahansah,” (4) “under Sahpuhr sahansah.”
The provisions are valid for the souls of them all. Inside these sections,
the names are arranged according to rank and dignity; where the
rank is the same, equal or similar names are often grouped together

for purposes of mnemonics; family names are borne only by the high
aristocracy; besides, there are titles, among them e.g. the grand eunuch.
Comparing it with Islamic waqf inscriptions, which like this one
are written on the walls of existing sanctuaries, and are excerpts of a
document, the waqf-namah proper, deposited in archives, one can call
the Ka‘ba inscription a waqf, with such distinctions as required by
the different cult. This is the notion which the Greek version of the
inscription tries to express by ^yyp<i<f>ov tov cio'c^a.A.to'jLtctTo? ttjv
The mafatih al-‘ulum rightly translate the Ir. term “rawanagan”—i.e.
pa-ravan of the inscription—by auqaf: the Sasanian institution is the
origin of the Islamic one. At the Achaemenian epoch, the originals
were clay tablets, as for instance some found in Susa, or stone tablets
like the fragments of Darius’ tomb inscription discovered at Persepolis;
also papyri.
The analogy between the Shahpuhr inscription and the so-called
“Community list” of Yr.13 is perfect. There, too, the majority of names
^ P. Scheil, Mem.Del. Perse XI, 2iss.



MEMORIAL DOCUMENT OF YT.I3 37
are such of men, but ten per cent are names of women; in the Ka‘ba
inscription they stand between the names of men, in Yr.13 they are
in a separate paragraph; all the women belong to the highest nobility,
with their family names added, most of them are married, but not all.
In both documents the names extend over three generations, with a
special group of children. The sequence is one of rank and dignity. In
Y/.13, Zoroaster and his next relatives take precedence even over Vis
taspa and his family. Within groups of equal rank one observes the
same grouping of identical or similar names. Members of the same
noble families, distinguished by their family name which none but a
nobleman can have, are grouped together in both inscriptions, etc.
All persons in both lists are without exception high and highest
dignitaries and their relatives, in old language “xsayant, kavi and
hvetu.” The 16 “aryaman, clients,” form a kind of codicil in Yr.13. But
neither here nor there “commoners” are mentioned, “vastrya.fsuyant
or huti, peasants and laborers.” That changes the concept of the “first
community” considerably. This was not a community of people con
verted or of the same religious conviction, but the clan and the clien
tela of a vispatis and satrap who had espoused a cause and whose lead
all his clansmen, officers and clients were in duty bound to follow.
In spite of an interval of about 800 years, redaction and style of both
lists are the same, and it follows that the list of Y/.13 is taken from the
original of the waqf, the rawan-document, which was “made fast,
Arab, waqafa or habasa, OP. han.drang-, handraxta, han.dunga,”
when Vistaspa founded a memorial fire, with masses for the “souls,”
or “memory” of all persons named. The fact that Zoroaster and his
relatives rank before Vistaspa shows that Vistaspa founded the temple
“for the soul of Zoroaster and for his own soul,” but also that Zoro
aster was a “homotimos, of equal rank” with Vistaspa (see under ‘Social
Structure’).
This was a temple like the one in which the cypress was planted.
Kishmar lies close enough to Tosa, the residence of Vihaspa, for them
to be regarded as the same. But the legends of the great “ataxs e Var
hran or dynastic fires,” viz. the aSar xvarrah or farnabag on the roSita
mountain, or the aSar burzenmihr of Revand, both quite near Tosa
and Nishapur, ascribe their foundation likewise to Vistaspa, and just as



38 MEMORIAL DOCUMENT OF YT.I3
Shahpuhr founded five, the grand vizier Mihrnarseh three fires
among them a “fire of the cypress, sarwisthi”—^Vihaspa may have
founded more than one fire at the same time. Firdausi identifies the
Burzenmihr fire with that of Kishmar.
The reason for incorporating the memorial list just in y/.i3 was
not an intrinsic connection of ideas, but a matter of form. The names
were recited by the priests at the masses with “We pray for the souls
of. . . .” No yasht offered so perfectly fitting an occasion as this hymn
to the heroes and manes. Both are “souls,” the fravarti and the ruvan;®
only the Zoroastrian term “ruvan” had to be replaced by the maz
dayasnian “fravarti”; even the genitive case is the original form of the
list (except for some names written without inflection).
Though preserved in a yasht, the list is a gathicissimum. It has the
value of an inscription on a ruin of its period. It is composed by order
of Vihaspa for Zoroaster. All its names—and that means all the names
appearing in the Gatha and those which passed over into the Awesta
are real and historical. The date of this document, between the years
529 and 522, probably in 527 b.c., has been discussed under ‘Chronology.’
The single names, therefore, are worth studying thoroughly. The
following is only a beginning.
Among the brothers and cousins of Vistaspa is one atarhvarnah. On
the Persepolis tablet, dated “month adukanis, year 16 of Darius,” i.e.
April 506 B.C., one (El.) par.na.k.ka, i.e. (OP.) hvarnaka, (Gr.) Phar
nakes, transmits to the chief of the archives, (El.) ke.so.pat.ti.s, OP.
’ge^upatis (Akk. gitepatu), the order of the king to slaughter a hun
dred sheep for (the celebration of the birth of) his daughter’s daughter,
dux^'is, Artystone (II). Cameron notes that the same Parnakka ap
pears in a similar action on another tablet to which he apposed his seal:
Hvarnaka, son of Rsama.” In 506, the well known Rsama was the
father of Vistaspa and grandfather of Darius, who was still alive in
522 B.c. It is he who uses, on his gold tablet, for the first time
the gentilic “haxamanisiya.” A son of Darius and Artystone (I) was
called after him (Her. 111,88 and vii,69), evidently as the first great

grandson, possibly born shordy after Rsama’s death. Artystone (II) is
certainly called after her maternal grandmother whom Darius loved
so much that he had a golden statue made of her (Her. \ti,69). The
name Rsama goes on in the Achaemenid family : Arsames, governor of
Egypt about 420, bears the title br byt’, ‘vaisapu^ra, on a parchment
from Elephantine. Hvarnaka, son of Rsama, is a brother of Vistaspa
and uncle of Darius. His name is a hypocoristic of a compound in
-hvarnah. The atar.hvarnah of y/.i3 is also a brother of Vistaspa; cf.
the case of Pisisyo^na, son of Vistaspa in Y/.13, and historic Pis
southnes, son of Hystaspes (II), under ‘Notarya.’ The conclusion is:
the full name of Parnakka-Hvarnaka was atar.hvarnah, and the atar.
hvarnah of Y^.i3 is the historical Pharnakes. Combining therewith
a remark of Diodorus 31, 19,1 he was the brother-in-law of his cousin
Cambyses I, and is the Pharnakes whom the kings of Pontus considered

unhistorically—as their ancestor. Pliny NH.33,151 tells of a silver
statue of his.
Vistaros in Y/.i3,i02 is gen. of the nom. “vis(a)tarus notaryano,”
metrical formula of Yt.^,y6. Wb. offers two unsatisfying Awestic ety
mologies, one of them : vi + V star- “bed-maker.” He is placed in
the line: Zoroaster-Vistaspa-Vistaros-several great families, to which
correspond in the list of women, §139, Haugavi-Hutosa-Vispatarusi
Frani-Asabana. The name, hence, is not a personal, but a family name,
as are Franya and Asabana, and VispatarusI is a sister or daughter of
Vistarol One must read "visatarus and *visatarusi. Old Persian against
Median “‘vispa.tarvan and vispatarvari, all-vanquisher.”** Visatarusi
does not mean “the all-vanquishing woman,” but “lady Visatarus, nee
Visatarusi”; it is the fern, of the gentil. ‘visatarusya, derived from the
nom. visatarus, like OP. ha^amanisiya from the nom. ha^amanis, and
Zoroaster’s patr. vivahusa from the nom. ‘vivahus of vivahvah. These
neologisms belong all to the very same period of the language, and
OP. ha^amanisiya is attested in the gold tablet of Rsama just a few
years before Gath, vivahusa and Yr.13 visatarusi. The name visatarus
follows in Y/.13 that of Vistaspa’s brother (called “brother” already by
Chares of Mitylene) Zarivaris, and precedes Spantadata and other sons
® With OP. visa against Med. vi‘;na, as in visadahyus and ^visaSana (in El. wissatana) against Med. vispazana. -usi would be regular fern, of a stem in -vah, nom.m. -us, but the gen.m. would be Aw. -uso, not -os. In OP., apparently, the -vah-siems had been transferred, from the nom. in -us, into the u-class.

of Vikaspa; thus, he belongs to the generation of brothers and cousins
of Vistaspa. In the Sh^namah the “notaryano” became a “son of
NoSar” under the synonymous, equally OP. name Gustahm, Gr.
< ‘visatahman “all-powerful.” This name does not come
from the Awesta, but may well be an immediate tradition of the epics
and actually the personal name of the man who was “the visatarusya,
vispatis of that clan.”
The second element of the name vaqhu.Sata in 13,119 can be Med.
data (Ar. *dha-, in which and StSw/ri coalesce); that would
make the name a syn. of vahyazdata, name of the second Pseudo
Smerdis in Behistun. But the name of the father is xvaSata, which does
not mean “self-created,” but “well-born,” hence is OP. hv.aSata = Med.
hvazata, epithet of Ardvi in (Aw. V zan-, OP. V 8an-, Gr.
ylyvoyi.ai). According to rules of IE. onomastics, names of sons and
fathers contain identical elements; therefore vaqhu.Sata is Old Persian,
a synonym of the father’s name hvaSata, and corresponds to Med.
*vahu.zata, cf. vyzt’ in Esther 9,9, i.e. vezata < ‘vahyazata > NP.
BehzaS, a very frequent name: Eugene. In the same §119 the name of
this family appears as “vaqhu.Satayana, the Eugenians”; they were a
noble Persian clan.—In Beh. §68, Darius does not give the family names
of his six companions, but only their fathers’ names. One of them,
Bagabuxsa, had a grandson of the same name who was married to
Amytis, daughter of Xerxes and Amestris, through her mother grand
daughter of another companion, Otanes, Hutana of Beh. §68; they had
a grandson called Spitama (see under ‘Spitama’). The father of Baga
buxsa I is called OP. [ jhyahya (gen.), El. ta.t.tu.wan.ia (nom.),
Akk. za.’.tu.’.a. The striking variance of the El. and the Akk. forms
assures restoration and etymology of the OP. name: [datvjhy,^"
Satavahya. The El. spelling shows the archaic OP. pronunciation
8atovar)hya, Akk. the contemporary Med. zatoveh, which has almost
reached Med. zadoe (Syr.), NP.Arab. zadoy, zadveh. Ibn Khurdadhbih
knows this to be title (or family name?) of the rulers of Sarakhs in
Khurasan. OP. Satovahya is vyzt’ {Esther 9,9), vahya.zata > Behzad
with elements transposed, and this is the original compound, an ap
pellative “well-born, evyevij<;J' while the transposition is only the prod
uct of rules governing the onomastics of proper names traditional in

families. Thus, the name Satovahya reveals that the man belonged to
a Persian family in which the OP. names hvaSata, vahu.Sata, vahya.
8ata were hereditary, that means to the family called vaqhu.Satayano
in Y^.i3,ii9.
By analogy one may connect another companion in Beh. §68, Ardu
manis (“straight-minded,” to Gath, rzva) vahaukahya pu^''a, son of
Vahoka (Gr. short form of a name with Vahu-) with Y/.13.108
var)haus arsyahya pu^ro, Vahu-X, son of Arsya, (right-acting, -minded,
to Gath. rsva).
At a prominent place, after Zoroaster’s cousin MaSyomaha and Sena
Ahumstut, his so-called “apostles,” before the three Franya, his broth
ers-in-law, and before his sons, a paraidiSaya is enumerated in §97.
Bartholomae attempted an Awestic etymology also of this name, which
is evidently Old Persian: parideSiya with OP. diSa against Med. diza.^^
It is equivalent to Firdausi, and in view of its adjectival form, a name
of family or provenance rather than a proper name.
Other Persian names are e.g. rta.rve^a in §116, against Med. -rvesa,
\^*vrik-.“ Arava.ukra, i.e. '"arva.ustra, against Med. arvat.aspa. Also
the name of the Haugava avara.ustri is OP., in the most likely case
that avara- hides a participle stem. Zoroaster as well as Vistaspa have
many Persians in their closest surroundings. This observation extends,
as we shall see later, to the Haugava and the Vehviya. And the study
of the names of foreigners in §§125-26 shows people really unexpected
in that circle and gives an indication that Vistaspa himself—though
his name is purely Median—must have been a Persian.
Not counting Sena, there are seven names of provenance which
must, from the beginning, be understood as ethnics, not as gentilicia.
The first is muza from the muzaya dahyaus, then a r6zd(i)ya and a
tan(i)ya from the countries of the same name. In the entire Iranian
area nothing resembles the last two names but there are similar names
in the Far West, rozdiya is apparently formed from Tuzd, *ruzd, as
Aw. toziya from *tuc. This ruzd must present a foreign local name;
r may replace 1, zd dd, thus Lydia, Ass. luddi, and Rhodos are to be

considered.*^ Lydia is represented in OP. inscriptions by the name of
its capital Sardis: Sparda, c£. Isa. 60,9; 66,19: Tarsis ^ou8 and Lud;
or Chron. 1,7: rodanim. Tanis is, in Herodotus, Strabo and Ptolemy,
the capital of the nomos of the same name at the “Tanitic” mouth
of the Nile, not far from Suez, and must have been known to Iranians
since the time of Cambyses.
For muzaya two explanations are possible. The name of Egypt, Arab.
Misr, in the OP. inscriptions is mudraya, Akk. misir (nom. misru),
El. much (c may be palatal). The vowel u in OP. and El. expresses
the darkening of i before Semitic emphatic consonants.** d is no real
rendering of Sem. s; it is the group dr that renders sr. In NiR.A., the
OP. equivalent of Aw. vazra, in VaSra.bara is spelled v 0'" (br). OP.
cuneiform has no sign for 8*, but the phonetic development tr > ^r >
0* > ss demands the parallel dr > 8r > 8* > zz. The OP. nota
tion va^'a means va8''a, and mudraya means spoken *mu8*aya, ‘muz
zaya, and Aw. muzaya renders this OP. pronunciation of the name
of Egypt in Awestic characters.*'
But Aw. z is a sign invented only in the 4th century a.d. on account
of oral tradition; the written archetype had no sign for it, but expressed
c, I and z by Aram. s. Therefore, muzaya is mudraya if the oral tradi
tion was right. Otherwise, another way is open. The region on the
Indian Ocean, old Magan, is called maka, adj. maciya in the inscrip
tions, but Scylax of Caryanda (source of Hecataeus and Herodotus)
wrote, in the very years of the memorial list, mykoi, with y = u, of
which the adjective would be 'muciya. The vowel is justified in such
aboriginal names, as Kassu: kussu, Qardu: Qurti, Amman: Umman
etc. Thus the equation would be: maka: maciya = mykoi: ‘muciya, and
the archet. notation for *muciya would be the same as for Aw. muzaya:
mvsy.

ought to belong to the sphere of names of jewels like lu’lu’, yaqut,

yaqut.^®
Between muzaya and rozdiya stand two pairs, fratura asruta besatas
mra and ’vrgvs rzvtv oiymatasturahe. With these two exceptions, all
of the 16 or 17 foreigners have their indispensable ethnic, two of them
only the ethnic, two ethnic and patronym, two ethnic and names of
father and grandfather, two ethnic and name of the clan.
The first pair of names is preserved in the archaic form of a gen.
duaP® “of the two besatastura,” which can only be a term of profession
or an ethnic. The following pair, on the contrary, has singularic form,
hence “of the ’v. (son) of rz., of the oiymatastur(a).” Here the long
word could be a personal name; but since its second element is the
same as in the foregoing case where it cannot be a personal name, this
is ruled out and one must detach -stura or -tura as the indispensable
ethnic. The s may be the initial of the ethnic or a rest of the case
ending of the foregoing word, but probably it is a sandhi s, intro
duced when the foregoing words, written without inflection, were
considered as first elements of a compound.
Besata and oiymata are clear, and interesting words, besata, archet.

The Achaemenids had several Greek physicians, e.g. Apollonides of

Gabriel of Singara under Xusrau II ; their title was drustpet. Here the
foreign physicians apparently bear Iranian names which can only he

As name of a foreigner (in an Awestic, i.e. Median text), veymata,
like the word besaSa, can only be Old Persian. The fact that physicians
in ordinary have an OP. title, and that foreign clients assume OP. names

or receive them as honorifics—proves the nationality of their em
ployer, not their own; the ethnic tvr- must not be Iranian at all, but
Vihaspa must be a Fersian.
The name “vahya.gmata, welcome” and its type is not attested as
n.pr. of an Iranian. MP. BehamaS < Vahya.aymata, it is true, corre
sponds exactly to vegmata, but appears only among the many names
of the three magi, into which also other names of the memorial list
intruded, in the group BehamaS, ZudamaS and DrustamaS,'' all three
synonyms of the greeting “welcome!” and all three philosophical in
ventions.—On the contrary, such names are common among all Semitic
peoples. The oldest are theophoric, with the name of the god Sulmanu,
Salamanu, Salamu, Salim; but the verb is the general word for greet
ing. The type of names is most frequent among Jews (cf. Solomon and
Jerusalem). Vegmata may well be the translation of such a Semitic
name, and tvr may hide the name of a Semitic country. In the ShabrJEr.
§57, s.v. Nun-Nineveh, the prophet Daniel, balatsusur > balaturus, is
called a “tura,” from an original a^ura. This name, Assur of old, had
become the name of the satrapy “Syria and Mesopotamia” under
Achaemenian administration. Thus, “tura” may be “Syrian” in that
meaning, from an original a^ura. It may also designate the town
Tyrus, Sor, through an Aramaic intermediary."®
22 In Bar Bahlul, cf. Markwart, uge 11,13, “Names of the Magi.” 23 If -tura is “Syrian,” since this name includes Palestine, the Vegmata-Solomon and the physician may have been Jews, and Vistaspa, protector of Zoroaster, would have had a Jewish physician in ordinary like many princes since. It was not even necessary to get him from Jerusalem. Jews li\ed in Gozan, the Ras al-‘ain region, since the time of the Assyrian captivity. TiglathPileser III and Sargon exiled some men of conquered territories: two officials of Gozan, in a letter to an Assyrian king, are possibly Jews, cf. H. G. May, Bibl. Archeologist vi, 1943, 55-60, Ctineif. Texts from Kannti in Mesopotamia, about 700 B.c. The Jewish colony of Ctesiphon, the maqom Kaspiya, from which Ezra got Levites for Jerusalem, goes back to the foundation of tliat “castrum” by Cvrus, when he conquered Opis in 539 b.c.

Another name, which like besaSa indicates a special office and like
Puta belongs geographically to the lands at the Indian Ocean, is
khrkana. Aw. khrka, OP. krka means “cock.” In the OP. inscriptions
it is the name given to the Carians, but not those at the southwest
corner of Asia Minor who were subjects of the empire since 545 b.c.,
but those called Bannesu in Xerx.Pers.daiv., the crew of the Persian
fleet who, along with the Yona, Ionian sailors, transported the building
materials to Susa. This was done by the fleet under the command of
their admiral, Scylax of Caryanda, a Carian. Bannesu is no ethnic, but
the name of the “Carian villages” which Alexander visited and where
he founded an Alexandria, later Charax Spasinou, on the bank of the
Shatt al-'Arab opposite Basra, see under ‘Navigation.’
The name of the Khrkana of y/.i3 is hufrava^s, hwrv’xs,"^ which
may render a foreign, e.g. a Greek name like ‘Y'n-e(t)poxo9'‘’ or a
Carian name in -ax; cf. (jrvXa^ “watch-dog.” In this document no galley
slaves or sailors can appear; the Carian was the chief of the colony, an
admiral, navapatis, like the Carian captains of the “Ship-building
Papyrus” and Scylax. In the inscriptions, the Carians -Krka always
occupy the last place; so does the khrkana in the document.
Under Cambyses, at the very time of our document, Scylax was
commander of the navy, “skylax” means “dog.” He explored for
Darius, before 515 b.c., the navigability of the Indus and the Indian
Ocean as far as Suez, also the northern coast of the Mediterranean as
far as the Pillars of Hercules, and, besides, in a few fragments pre
served, he described the Black Sea and the Caspian, and the countries
Parthava and HvarazmiL He must have been in Tosa, the capital of
Parthava. A remark on shipbuilding material in the Armenian moun
tains (see under ‘Navigation’) shows that he was there before
“captivit\" of Salmanassar IV, and this entailed the wrong identification, e.g. in the Acts of S. Pethion, of the Di>ala with the river Gozan. Both the seblta are no unknown Christian, but Jewish “captivitates,” used by the bishops as local names. The Eusebius passage, hence, is historical, and its source is, as has been surmised, the book irepi Toi;6otW, wrongly attributed to Hecataeus of Abdera, in reality composed about loo b.c. Cf. E. Jacoby in Pauly re vii, 2766-68, and E. Meyer, Christentiim ii, 24!?. 2 -^ Not a genitive, but a form without inflection. Wb. explains “bene mentulatus,” which might be an .Arab laqab, but is impossible as an Iranian assumed or honorific name. Of course other Ir. et\mologies are possible. In \ie\v of Gr. ApoHonia, MP.

Darius’ accession, at the very time when Vistaspa resided there and
gave Zoroaster asylum. Scylax seems to have lived till 480 b.c. Caryanda
may have been his or his father’s home. Living in the Carian colony
at the Gulf would have qualified him specially for his great explora
tion. Perhaps Scylax “dog” was a popular surname. In the script of
the Aw. archetype this name would appear as ’skvr’xL There must
have been some relation between him and the hvprv’xs of the docu

The investigation of the names of foreigners reveals with different
degree of probability the occurrence of Rhodos or Lydia (rozdiya),
Egyptians (taniya and muzaya), Abyssinians (puta), Syrians or town
Tyros (tura), Carians (khrkana). A strong confirmation of the single
equations is their being grouped together. In the OP. inscriptions
correspond the satrapies: Beh. 4-5 a^ura-arbaya, 6 mudraya, 7 tye

codicil at the end 23 maka. In Vers, e: 5-6 arbaya-a^ura, 7 mudraya, 10

16 yona of the islands, 18 maciya, 19 arbaya, and at the end 28 putaya,

scriptions: the Persian empire.



III. HOUSE SPITAMA
^_^Ua]l -JT
Zoroaster bears the gentilic Spitama, MP. Spitaman. This is probably
the short-form of a compound name, and the only known one is Spita
menes, *spitamanah. These names are to each other as Arsames, Rsama
to Arsamenes, rsmanah.^
The Spitama must have been a great family, for they bear a second
gentilicium hecataspana. They were an historical family, because their
name occurs in Greek as well as in Babylonian literature. The business
documents of Murasu Sons of Nippur, the greatest banking firm of
their period, which conducted money affairs for Darius II and Pary
satis, mention a '“is.pi.ta.am.mu.^ This is the exact time when Ctesias
also speaks of them. He was told at the court, at the end of the 5th
century, that Amytis, daughter of the last Median king, Astyigas,
whose dowry was the whole of Media, had first married the Spitamas,
and later Cyrus.
It must have been a well known fact that Astyages had no male
heirs, else the Median pretenders, Fravartis in Beh.2/[ and Ci6>rantaxma
in §53, would have claimed descent from him instead of Cyaxares.
The daughter was the heiress, and Cyrus married her for legitimating
his succession.
Ctesias heard his stories from the ladies of the court and thus got a
truly Persian presentation of the facts. The Iranian legend kept the
memory of the marriage of Nebuchadnezzar with the Median prin
cess in the reversed, more flattering form: ©retdna asked three daugh
ters of Nebuchadnezzar in marriage for his three sons; and the fact
of the conquest of Niniveh under the form: “Nun came to KaiKavat
[the founder of the Median dynasty] by marriage.” Tu felix Austria
nube! Behind these distortions of history is the idea that, who is not
an agnate, azata, must at least legitimate himself by affinitas, as son-in
law, an idea which comes down from the matriarchal past of the
country and survived to the present time.
iLommel; “spita.ama, mit heller Kraft”; Duchesne, §201, against it: nowhere attested as foursyllabic; tentatisely “Skr. amati, a I’edat briilant.” I assume short form of a fuller name.

HOUSE SPITAMA 49
The name Amytis may be, but is not of necessity historical. In
Berossos’ story, the name ’AjivLT-ri, of the wife of Nebuchadnezzar, is
historical: for her he built the “Hanging Gardens” the substructure
of which has been excavated in Babylon. Amyite-Humaya (see under
‘Notarya’) was the name of ladies of the Median house, as later of
Achaemenids, and the two families were related by marriage.
The name of Zoroaster’s parents does not appear in the memorial
document, so they died probably before that time. Yet, as Visatahma
may be the proper name of “the Visatarus,” so Spitrasp may have been
the proper name of “the Spitama.” The mother’s name appears only
once in an ungrammatical fragment of the Hat.Nas^: Dugdova, MP.
Duydav. It sounds archaic and mythical, and, since married ladies were
called with their family name only, must not be historical, no more
than Amytis. A story in Tabari 111,1632 is instructive: “Ibn Shuja' al
Balkhi told: I was with the emir (Muhammad the Tahirid) who quietly
talked with me while he was listening to the curses upon every member
of his family (shouted by a mob besieging his palace in Baghdad).
When they came to the name of his mother, he laughed and said: I
wonder how they come to know the name of my mother, even among
the slave-girls of my father, abul l-‘Abbas ‘Abdallah b. Tahir, there were
many that did not know it! I said: O prince, I have never seen a cooler
and more forbearing spirit than yours! He replied: And I certainly
have never seen anything more efScient than patience with men!”
Ctesias was told that Astyages’ daughter had two sons from the
Spitamas, Spitakes and Megabarnes. The first name is, like the family
name, a short form of Spitamanah; the second is baga.hvarnah,^ a
decidedly non-Zoroastrian name. These two Spitama would have been
Astyages’ heirs and successors to the throne. Ctesias regards them as
half-brothers of Cambyses and Smerdis, and hence makes them receive
satrapies when Cyrus settled the succession. Spitakes would have
received the satrapy of the Derbissoi, i.e. the darwishs,* whose country
he seems to locate towards India, while it was adjacent to Hyrcania
and Parthava. Megabarnes is said to have received the Barkanioi =

Hyrcanians.^ On all four, obeisance to their mother is imposed: One
all but hears the ladies telling the story.
Like most things Ctesias wrote, this settlement of Cyrus’ succession
is considered to be unhistorical, and Markwart tried to prove it so in
UGE. It is proved to be historical by the strange word Trari^et^Tj?, i.e.
pa^yazata “heir presumptive. Germ. Neben-Agnat” (see under ‘Mago
phonia’), which Herodotus quotes erroneously as name of the Pseudo
Smerdis, but which can only be the title of the true Smerdis. Whether
the half-brothers received any satrapies, and which ones, cannot be
checked, but it would be the most natural thing that their mother
insisted on their being indemnified for having lost, by her second
marriage, the succession to the throne, and the whole settlement has
an analogy in the succession of the caliph al-Mutawakkd, by which
the two elder designated sons divided almost the whole empire between
them, while the third received a small territory only.
The half-brother relationship is not disproved by the fact that Cam
byses and Smerdis were sons of Cassandane, daughter of Pharnaspes,
and not of the Astyigas daughter, as Ctesias believed. Cambyses and
Gomata as Pseudo-Smerdis both marry Atossa, hence were not sons
of her mother. They do so, because she was by her mother the heiress,
agnate, a granddaughter of Astyages. The Atossa-Hutosa of the Awesta
is called azata, and Darius, in order to prove his claim to the succession,
says: “of old we were aSata, agnates.” Thus Ctesias shifts the relation
ship only in an unessential point: the two Spitama as well as Cambyses
and Smerdis were half-brothers of Atossa.
The traditional date of Zoroaster leaves some margin: the second
marriage of Astyigas’ daughter was contracted in 550 b.c. after the
conquest of Agbatana. If born before 569, Zoroaster could be the first
husband, Ctesias’ Spitamas; if after 569, her son Spitakes. A man
designated by the gentilicium alone must be regarded as the vispatis
of the house, hence Spitamas as “the Spitama,” and therefore Zoroaster
rather as Spitakes, the “viso pu^ro, heir of the family Spitama, the
younger Spitama.” On the other hand, the mention of a grandson,
Rvatatnara aparazata, in the document of y/.i3, certainly before 522,
“ Bap/caj'ioi < *\arkaniya, vrddhi of vrkana, as varfoagnl: vrSragna. c£. TrifiotTTjs, Ziboetis

HOUSE SPITAMA 51
probably about 527 b.c., prevents us from lowering the date 569 con
siderably. Cyrus’ marriage to the Median heiress was a political one;
she was no longer young. If she was born in 585, Zoroaster, born about
569, may be her son of the first husband, and Atossa, born soon after
549, her daughter of the second husband.
Another Spitamas appears in Ctesias, Pers. 38-40, under Artaxerxes I.
Amytis, daughter of Xerxes and Amestris, full sister of Artaxerxes I,
whom Dinon calls the most beautiful and most unbridled woman of
Asia, was married to Bagabuxsa II, Megabyzos of Xerxes’ campaign
against Greece, of the family VaqhuSatayana (see under ‘Mem.Doc.’).
Having subdued Egypt in 455, he became satrap of Syria, but revolted
in that vast province, and defeated a first army sent against him under
Usiris, and a second under Menostates. The latter was the son of
Artar(e)ios, i.e. Akk. Artarewa, father of Manustana, “mar biti sarri,
royal prince,” in 431-424, a half-brother of Artaxerxes. After the defeat
of his son, Artarewa opened negotiations which Amestris persuaded
her son, the king, to approve. Thus an envoy was sent to Bagabuxsa.
The poorly preserved text of Ctesias says: Tre/tTrerat ovv ’Aprap[e]to9
re avTO^ koI ’'AfjLVTL<; rj ywq Kal 'Apro^dpr]^ erSiv wv eiKocn Kal
IleT^oras 6 OvcripLO<s Kal ’S.Tnrdpa TraTrjp.
As it stands, this is impossible. That Artarewa heads the mission is
natural, and also Petesas was welcome, because his father Usiris, though
defeated, had been a friend of Bagabuxsa. Amytis went with the mis
sion, hence had not been with her husband in Damascus, but with her
brother at Susa. But the two remarks regarding Artoxares and Petesas
are utterly senseless. Artoxares was the name of a Paphlagonian eunuch
of Darius II, often mentioned by Ctesias {Pers. §§49-53) and as
Artahsara in the same business documents from Nippur, where the
Spitama, too, is mentioned, between 443 and 420. Eunuchs were sent
on diplomatic missions, but not when they were “already 20 years old”
and had no experience at all. And there is not the slightest reason
to tell that Usiris’ son, a rather young man, was father of a child
Spitama. Moreover, the “Kal” is stylistically objectionable. Obviously
Ctesias said “already 20 years old and father of a son Spitama.” Some
body who saw the eunuch in the name Artoxares separated therefore
the fathership and attributed it to Petesas. In reality Artoxares—the
name is probably corrupt—is not the eunuch, but was a son of Baga

buxsa and Amytis, and Ctesias adds this remark thinking that Amytis,
whom her father Xerxes, as he tells, had lectured many times, did not
change her way of life even as a grandmother. With the two envoys

both friends of Bagabu^sa—came the family, the wife with son and
grandson, in order to show that one was serious and did not retain
the family as hostages. Spitama was the name of a grandson of Baga
buxsa, a Vanhudatayana, whose own paternal grandfather, as the
maternal grandfather of his wife, had been companions of Darius.
These families were also related by marriage to the Spitamas: Baga
buxsa’s mother seems to have been a Spitami.
In the Gatha and the Awesta the following members of the Spitama
appear
:
Purusaspa + Dugdova (brother) Arastiya
Zoroaster (cousin) MaSyomaha
sons: Isatvastra, Rvatatnara, Hvarci^ra Rtastu
(in Y.53,a “a son of Zoroaster”),
daughter: Purucista (¥.53,2: “youngest
daughter”)
I
Rvatatnara aparazata MaSyomaha aparazata
In the memorial document there are, besides, a ©rimi^want “triplet”
and devatbis, hater of the deva” without degree of relationship.
The old messianic belief in the return of the prophet after 6,000
years was the reason that the religious tradition of the following
periods transferred the sons of Zoroaster entirely into eschatologic
legend. In this literature many generations of descendants are enumer
ated, but none of the names is otherwise known. But as the Babylonian
documents are a testimony for the early history of the Spitama, so two
Sasanian documents are testimonies for their late period. Those are
two bullae of the office of the magus of Nihawand, in my collection,
which beside the official seal bear the personal seal of the magus, the
judge himself, a small male bust with the legend:
Zartuxst e magu e Spitaman
Zoroaster, the magus, of the Spitama.



HOUSE SPITAMA 53
The date is about a.d. 500. After a thousand years, a descendant may
have been qadi of Nihawand, just as many Talibids have been and
are still qadi, or as an Umayyad, ibn Abi 1-shawarib, was qadi al-qudat
under al-Mu‘tazz and al-Musta‘in. But without claim nobody could
bear that family name; to prevent it was the duty of the “ayinpet, or
naqib al-ashraf.”
The name Zoroaster, in antiquity, is known to us only as that of
the prophet. It is attested by a graffito on the wall of the Mannaean
rock-tomb of Fakhrika, in Aramaic script of the same character as the
script of the Darius tomb and the Elephantine papyri: i.e.
zrtv^tr].® Whether the grafiSto means the name of the writer
simply or the prophet, at any rate, the name was known in Media in
about 500 B.c. Earlier, in the detailed account of Sargon’s eighth cam
paign [Thureau-Dangin], we find a chief ‘’za.ar.du.uk.ku sa ^'Ha.ar.
zi.a.nu; in the “broken prism A” [H. Winckler, ii,pl.44,29] we read
^ha.ar.du.uk.ku sa ““‘Ha.ar.zi.a.nu, with ha as clerical error for za.
The notation in the original ephemerids was certainly d/tuk for du.uk.
harzianu is mod. Harsin,®'" SE of Kirmanshahan, not far from Bistun.
The personal name is an archaic hypocoristic in -ukku of a Median,
beginning with zarat-; the only known name is zara^ustra, but one
may assume ‘zarat.aspa.
The unsolved problem of the etymology of the name has shifted by
the discovery of MP. z r h v s t.^ The Aw. archet. was *z r t v s t r,
as on the graffito, four-syllabic ; in the fourth century a.d., with respect
to oral tradition, this was throughout rendered by zara^ustra. MMed.
zrhvst, confirmed by zarhuk of the Mss. of ibn al-Faqih, proves the 9
to be phonetically genuine. On the other hand, one cannot doubt that
zara 0- is a participle stem. Therefore one must assume -t.v->-^v->-0u

In the identical case of the names isat-vastra, fradat.vanhu,

In 678 B.C., in the Samas omina of Esarhaddon, the en.er of
all Medes bears the name wa.mi.ti.ar.si, assimilated to Ass.
mamitu “oath,” from Med. *vahmayat.rsa, with the Med. form
of the participle, denom. of vahma.^' But already in 716 b.c.,
in the Sargon annals, the chief of Surgadia (between Sihna and
Kirmansahan, in Ardilin), a “parsua, Persian,” is called
sepasarri, assimilated to this Ass. name from OP. xsepaya.rsti,

Also arava.ustra, i.e. '"arva.ustra of the memorial document,
Y/.i3,i 24, belongs here as counterpart to Med. arvat.aspa. Mark
wart, Cat.Proc.Cap.^’j, explained the name as “a.rayvat.ustra,

of the name. Since the vowels are rendered by oa—cf.
^pa6pTq<; < frovartis—not by the diphthong au^^ as in
M.t.0pava-rr)s < ‘mi^ra.vahista, Ti^pavcrrrjs < ‘ci^ra.vahista etc.,
the Greeks must have heard a form of four syllables, without
contraction, *zara.ostra < ‘zara.vastra, not *zaraustra. Al
though at the end of the 4th century all these groups of vowels
were contracted to o, the name of the prophet preserved its
archaic pronunciation.^* It follows that the Persians had as
similated the name to their dialect, and hence knew the
prophet, during his lifetime.
There are at least two genuine dialectic forms of the name,
zara^ustra < ‘zarat.vastra and zara.ustra < ’zara.vastra. The participle
stem is beyond doubt. The fact that Med. vastra was not supplanted
by OP. \asd'a., *vasa, is no more contradictory than Med. aspa for
OP. asa in OP. names. But if the name of the “Gatha-prophet” were
Gathic, one would expect vazdra.**® Gathic is no nationality and no
vulgar dialect. Zoroaster was a Mede, and Med. vastra is right.
Thus, the difficulty lies in the MP. and NP. forms zartuxst,
zardust. Syr. zaraSust in Ps.Meliton (Cureton, SpicilegSyr.2'^)
attests already in the middle of the 3rd century a.d. the pronun
ciation with 8 < t; the vocalization is Syriac. Only in the mid
dle of the 4th century a.d., Aturpat e Mahraspandan, the
inventor of the Awestic script, introduced everywhere the spell
ing zara^ukra. Down to the Sasanian period we know the
name only as that of the prophet. Therefore, the two pronun
ciations with ^ > h and t > 8 must have been used, in con
tradiction to the uniform spelling. But zarduk would be a
genuine development only in case that an old dialect would
have had *zarat.ustra.*®
Marlcwart started, as a remark in Siidarmenien shows, from ’zarvati-, hence stresses the Gr. vocalization Zoroas-, which actually is the effect of assimilation to aar^p and Greek euphony, cf, apaxticria for haravhati (inst. of -wx“-): ’papnaKCiTis for vharnauxati (inst. of -uKa-); avacnb^aSos for anosazaS (inst. of -uiaa-). i^The family name reoiroSpos preserves, in .VD. 50, the 9t, while lleipiSaTT^s (Awramani
and Meherdates (Tacitus) show that the change er>hr had taken place, and the common
word was no longer pu6r, but puhr. I'iain analogy to Med. bSxtris (in El. pakt®ris), OP. bax^^s (in El. paksis), and Bactr.

Let alone an equally impossible theory of Hertel, Beitr.2.16-221, it is

Frani, ©riti and Purucista, e.g. Nyberg, 265: “Zarathustra hatte . . .
drei Tdchter; davon dass er mehrere Frauen gehabt habe, weiss unser
Awesta nichts.” Polygamy was general, and no excuses are needed.
The Awesta leaves no alternative.
Just as Zoroaster opens the list of men on the memorial document,
so his wife HvogvP® opens the list of women in y/.i3,i39. Haugava
is the gentilicium of the two brothers Frasaustra and Zamaspa, the
benefactors of Zoroaster; hence “nee Haugavl.” Her name is followed
by Frani and ©riti. In 13,140 there are four Frani, all married to men
of the highest nobility, two of them Xstavayo; another Xstavi has an
Asabana, “nee Asabana.” In 13,97, after the Persian ParideSiya and
Zoroaster’s sons, three men appear with the family name franyehe;”
franya and frani are masc. and fern, of a gentilicium, hence “nee Frani.”
The three Franya are her brothers. Then follows ©riti, fern, of ©rita, like
wise the name of a man of the nobility in the list, hence “nee ©riti.”
Then comes Purucista, who is called Zoroaster’s “youngest daughter”
in Y.53,3 and bears the gentilicium of her father: “nee Spitami Hecat
aspana.” Women who bear a different family name cannot be daugh
ters, but only wives of Zoroaster.—In the list of men, Vistaspa and his
male relatives follow upon Zoroaster, and likewise in the list of women
the ladies of the house of Vistaspa, Hutosa and Humaya, also Visa
tarusi, follow upon the ladies of Zoroaster’s family. They are enumer
ated not according to age, but to rank.
Therefore, Zoroaster had three wives and one daughter. Haugavi
was the last wife he married, but the highest in rank. “The youngest
daughter” in y.53,3 seems to mean “youngest child,” since no other
daughters, but only brothers appear. Immediately before, the gatha
speaks of the zara^ustris spitamo. With the exception of Hertel, all
consider this as “son, descendant of Zoroaster”; according to him it
would refer “in der gewdhnlichen Bedeutung Anhanger Zoroaster’s”
to Vistaspa. Zoroaster cannot speak, in a gatha, of a “Zoroastrian,”
Gath, spelling: Aw. hvovT, fem. to patr. *haugava, vrddhi deriv. from *hugu. Wh.\Q\S\ “Eigenname, viell. patron.adj.” and loaaf.: “franya, Eigenname, der altesten Tochter Z.’s, wohl Kurzname.” Likewise 1857: “hvovi, Eigenname, eigtl. fem. zu hvova ‘die aus der Hv. Familie.’ ” Only the last remark is right: none of these names is a personal name.



58 HOUSE SPITAMA
no more than Christ of a “Christian,” and where else zara^ustris
occurs, thus in Y/.i3,98 (repeated in Y.23,2; 26,5), it must mean “son”;
in Raga zara^ustris it expresses the possession. Zara^ustris Spitamo
restricts the general, wider name Spitama even more than hecataspana,
and designates, at Zoroaster’s lifetime and at the side of the daughter,
a son, excluding a grandson.
Of the three sons mentioned in Y/.13, the name of the second,
Rvatatnara, is assured by the name of a grandson, Rvatatnara apara
zata. The definition of the notion naba.nazdista (under ‘Social Struc
ture’) shows that this child was a grandson, not a great-grandson of
Zoroaster. One reason to call a son after his father is his posthumous
birth, and it is possible that the list, like the Ka‘ba inscription, contains
names of deceased persons. Purucista was still unmarried at the time of
the document, hence under 16 years (see under ‘Maga’). The “Wed
ding Gatha,” 54,1-7, is composed in honor of her marriage, hence is
later than the document. The anonymous son, in this gatha, is cer
tainly the third and youngest, since the second brother was already
married before.
The proper name of the Haugavl is nowhere mentioned, neither are
those of other wives. Apparently, for married women, that was against
the custom. The later Parsi conception of the family relations is un
aware of these main facts which it replaces by erroneous interpretations
of YA13; therefore it is no real tradition. But in Y?.i6,i5,” verses dating
in the 2nd century b.c., like parts of the Videvdad, the Haugavl is with
reason considered to be the wife of Zoroaster, against Hertel’s attempt
to eliminate the words, and at that time one may still have known that
she was the daughter of Frasaukra. This is what the later tradition
asserts and must not have been inferred from a wrong interpretation
of Y.51,17 in combination with Y/.13, as late as in Sasanian times.
Rather Y.51 was misinterpreted because this tradition existed, for it is
confirmed by the Gatha, 49,7: “O Haugava Frasaustra, go there, where
both our most ardent wishes accompany you!” (see under ‘Poetry’),
that means “my and your daughter’s, the Haugavi’s wishes.” Sister is
improbable: Zoroaster was about forty years old at that time; his influ

ential benefactors were older; Zamaspa had a grandson and a great
grandson, his namesake, and Zoroaster did not marry a great-grand
aunt. Under ‘Notarya’ we shall mention cases where children were
born as grand-uncles and grand-aunts, and the Haugavi may have been
a grand-aunt when i6. Her daughter was Purucista.
But the fact, never contested except by Hertel, that the Haugavi was
a daughter of Frasaustra does away with the equally uncontested as
sumption that, according to y.53,2-3, Zoroaster married Purucista to
Zamaspa, the elder brother of her grandfather, who was already a
great-grandfather while she was about 12 years old. Purucista SpitamI
Hecataspana married, if her father makes it an occasion for a poem,
as first main wife a young man, just as her elder, but young brother
married his first wife (see under ‘Maga’).
The misunderstanding of family and proper names caused the mis
understanding of the whole relationship. It w'as equally thoughtless
not to recognize the social significance of the gentilicia. These are
derived from ancestors that lived generations ago; only aristocratic
families, “gentes,” can have eponyms, but no “nicht gerade besitzlose
Proletarier” (Nyberg, i94f.). The same type of names is still today
used in Persia, Iraq and Turkey: Taqizadeh, Gllanizadeh, Mik
hailghazizadeh etc. One of the four Frani in ¥^13,140, wife of
Usinamah, is considered by the Sasanian legend to be the ancestress
of the kavi-dynasty; in Firdausi, Franak is the mother of Fredon.
Such families are hvetu and kavi, and the Franya seem to have been
like the Spitama, a Median family.
To these names belongs also Damaspia, wife of Artaxerxes I, i.e.
“zamaspi, nee ZamaspI,” a Haugavi zamaspana, as Purucista is a
SpitamI hecataspana (see under ‘Haugava’). This manner of naming
women survives in Arsacid and Sasanian times in formations with
-duxt, which have been dealt with by Hiibschraann and Noldeke. A
number of seals—only ladies of property had seals—and the Ka‘ba
inscription furnish more examples.^’
Sjhpuhrduxt, i. wife of Narseh Sakansah, 2. daughter of Sahpuhr Mesansah; Hormizdu^tak, daughter of Nar.sch Sakansah; Narschduxt, herself a queen: Sakan banbisn; Varacduxt, a queen. This -du^t is not “daughter,” but title of the ladies of highest rank. The formation correspond.s to the gentilics in -pu^ra which replace at the same time older styles. Cf. Nenosengh; Spitama: spiumaputrah; Vi\ana: Geopothros. Later, the neutral -zadeh enters for puhr and du^t.



6o HOUSE SPITAMA
Ctesias’ remark on the marriage and dowry of Astyages’ daughter
implies that the Spitama were a rich Median house, and this gives
from the beginning an historical background to the Iranian tradition
which, unanimously, locates Zoroaster’s birth in the house of his father
Purusaspa at Raga. Raga is the natural capital of one of the great
fifths of Media, today represented by Teheran. OP. Raga, NP. Ray, is
first mentioned in the Beh. inscription in 521 b.c.; under Seleucus
Nicator it was called, as capital of its province, Eurdpos, under the
Arsacids Arsakia (see under ‘Videvdad’). In the Awesta, the town
appears only twice, in Vid.\,\% pre-Christian half of the Arsacid
period; and in Y.19,18, according to contents, language and unreal
forms raya, rajoit, not older.
FzW.i,i5: “As the twelfth best country, I, AhuraMazdah, created
Rayam ^rizantum”; Ahriman created there as “patiyaram, antagonism”
uparo.vimano.him, i.e. “*upara.vimanahyam, hyperscepsis.”"° At this
place the Pahl.Vid. comments: “They say, Zartust ac an )ak but, Zoro
aster was from there,” one cod. has “petak but, appeared from there,”
both meaning his birth.
Videvdad i is a geographical textbook in verses, of the Arsacid
period. The epithets of the towns, here ^rizantu, are understood as
gifts of AhuraMazdah, by which he made peaceful the “else-unpeace
ful, noit kudat.sati” countries (see under ‘Videvdad’). Ahriman’s
counter-creation is a well known thing.
Art.Vlr.Nam.i,j: “For three hundred years, till the time of Alexan
der, ‘apegumanih, freedom from doubt’^^ prevailed, after him came
sectarianism, false doctrines, ‘gumanih’ and heterodoxy. . . .” Also
Mdh Frav. §30: Hvlsytl teaches men the den e mazdesn and they be
come “apeguman.” Of Nisaya-Alexandropolis, the oldest capital of
the Arsacid kingdom, Vid.i says: “Ahriman created there ‘vimanahya,
scepsis. With these two remarks, the Videvdad describes the very
capitals of its period, hiisaya and Raga, as the Greek towns Alexan
dropolis and Europos.
The Pahl.transl. has: “rak (or: ray) e Ill-toxmak, (gloss:) hast ke
Pahl.transl. apar.vimanakih, cf. Duchesne §154. 21 al-Mutawakkii says in his edict against the ahl a!-dhimma, Tabari m.iySgff.: “Allah
in His immeasurable greatness and the omnipotence of His will, has chosen Islam . . . and
has made it victorious over the other religions, free from doubts."



HOUSE SPITAMA 6l
ray goyend” ; rak is transliteration, ray pronunciation, toxmak, a word
of OP. origin, “species, genus,” is syn. of Aw. zantu only in its ethnic
acceptation; zantu was not used in OP., hence not in hlP., and there
fore not clearly understood. One commentator says: “Ill-toxmak,
because good priests, warriors and peasants come from there,” taking
zantu as “station in life.” It is “district,” and toxmak is unfit as trans
lation of “^rizantu, consisting of three districts.” This is the official
designation of that fifth of Media, itself a unit of three parts, a term
of administration like Kal JlapairaKrjvrj for the whole of the
satrapy. The three natural parts of Rhagiane are i. Qazwin, 2. Teheran,
Raga itself, 3. Kum, pre- and early Muhammedan Kamindan.
Aw. ^rizantu is a word like Gr. with pK = Ir. vis. Od.i^,
117:

did no longer understand their archaic word. O. Schrader compared
with it the name of the Thracians: Spr}^ <'@prjpLKe<;, with 9pa.
“four,” hence “consisting of four vis.” One sees how archaic the whole
idiom is.
The second place, Y.19,18, is a catechism: “Who are the ratu, judges?
—The lord of the house, of the clan, of the district, of the province,
fifth Zoroaster, in all provinces except Raga zara^ustris; this is ca^ru.
ratus, has only four ratu.—Who are the ratu? (those four?) —^The lord
of the house, of the clan, of the district, fourth Zoroaster.”
This is a perfectly clear statement. Leaving aside the role it attributes
to Zoroaster as highest authority everywhere,' it makes him the “ratu
of the dahyu Raga,” while in other provinces other men were satraps.
Therefore the Pahl. translation and Neriosengh’s Sanskr. translation
(see Jackson, Zor. 203f.) add to Raga “deh i x^es, his own province.”
This is not a documented historical tradition, but some knowledge
supported by a right interpretation of zara^ukris as “belonging to Z.,”
combined with an interpretation of ^rizantu as “nmana, vis, zantu”
-- Connected with the thought that, as epithet of Raga in Videvdad i, Brizantus ought to be a special advantage, a gift of AhuraMazdah.



HOUSE SPITAMA

instead of “three zantu,” vertically instead of horizontally, not so big
a mistake, and the result is not far from truth. The gathas teach that
Zoroaster was banished from his province by a verdict of the court of
his home town, and Ctesias speaks of “satrapies” the two sons of the
Spitama received from Cyrus. The difference between satrapy and
hereditary possession is slight. But, building upon this passage the
theory of “Raga as Papal See, or Priesterstaat,” as Jackson and Nyberg
do, is a colossal inflation of just the slight mistake made by the authors
of the catechism.
Y.19,18 disproves also Markwart’s words in ErdnL 123,1: “Beinahe
selbverstandlich, dass aus dem epitheton z^a^ustris geschlossen wurde,
dass Raga der Geburtsort Zoroaster’s sei, so z.B. ‘Stadteliste’ §60, wo
ohne Zweifel eine Angabe iiber die Griindung von Raga ausgefallen
ist.” It is right, that the Sahr.Er. (composed about a.d. 490) ended with
a §60 on Raga, of which only the appended note remains: “zartust e
spitaman ac an sahristan but, Zoroaster was from that town.” But that
is the real meaning of the epithet, and all other inferences, drawn by
modern interpreters, are wrong.
Another local indication is found in the strange story of Zoroaster’s
“temptation” in Vid.ig,^^ and ii:
,dr3]ya‘ pati zbarahi nmanahya purusaspahya
The reading of the first word is doubtful; it is apparently mutilated,
for with one syllable more, the passage which is a quotation would
be a regular verse. Cf. yt.g,7.6 : “barsnus pati garinam drajaphe
(dra)aho?) . . .”
Gr.BdhM {Ind.Bdh.20,2,^) takes the word for the name of a river:
“daraja (in Aw. script) rot pat eranvez ke.s man e parusasp pitar e
zartust pa bar but, D. is a river in Eranvez, on the bank of which stood
the palace of Purusasp, father of Zoroaster.” The relative clause is a
mere paraphrase of the Videvdad passage, and the only base for the
assumption of a river is the wrong translation of Aw. zbarah by bar.'^
This river is located “in Eranvez” because Zoroaster prays in y/.5,io4
“at the mouth of the Vahvi Datiya of the Aryans,” a pseudo-Awestic
name of the Arsacid period for later Eranvez (see under ‘EranveY),
Also used in ^’.9,29 for “zbara^a, foot of a creeping animal”

“hizvo danlialia, in the language of erudition,” i.e. in Awestic, not in
the contemporary Middle Persian:
ya^a azam hacayane pu^ram yat arvataspahe

anu.(u)xtaye denayai anu.varkaye denayai
“That I always may pursue Vikaspa, the son of Arvataspa, for thinking
according to the religion, talking-according to, acting-according to the
religion.”
These verses are produced wholesale: in the Drumsp Yasht, 9.26, the
same words are repeated with Hutosa as object; one could paint the
steatopygic kallipygos “kicking against the pricks.” In Zoro
aster himself is driven, the god asks another one, to let him always be
the driver: a deus otiosus and a propheta otiosior. Benveniste, Inf.av.
53, calls the late passage of Y.8,7: “haxsaya ahya denaya anu.mata
yeca . . . , dois-je inciter a I’observance en pensee de la religion etc.”
the “enonce ancien; de la on passe” to the form of Y/.5,i8, 105; 9,26,
verses which therefore are even later. No other passages than this one
locate Zoroaster in Eranvez.
The abstract nouns formed with the preposition “anu, according to”
are malformations; dena, always trisyllabic, counts here only for two
syllables. In this false language the verses are fashioned after the
genuine prayers of the mythical heroes in the old hymns, where they
pray for victory over gods and men or personal adversaries. The
genuine passages locate those prayers in Eranvez, the home of the
myth. In the feeling of the diaskeuasts, AhuraMazdah and Zoroaster
cannot remain behind and therefore must likewise pray in the land of
the golden age, only “la pire misere intellectuelle (Meillet)” of the
period prevents them from achieving a decent prayer. On account of this
illusionary location, Zoroaster is no more “born in Eranvez” than Ahura
Mazdah, and one cannot conclude from the added “river in Eranvez”
of the Gr.Bdh. that in the 9th century a.d. the notion of Eranvez was
somehow connected with Raga.
Gr.Bdh.121 {Ind.Bdh.2^,’^)-. “daraja r5t rotbaran rat ce man e pitar
e zartuk pa bar[as], zartuk and zat, the D. river is the index of the
rudbar, for the palace of Zoroaster’s father stood on its bank, bar;
Zoroaster is born there.”



HOUSE SPITAMA
64
The first part, the raising of the rank of the river to “index of the
rudbar” is not possible without the wrong translation of zbarah by
bar in BdkM; its source is that paraphrase of Ffi.ip.—Rudbar “fluvia
tile” is a common notion, also a local name: the best known are be
tween Qazwin and Rasht, later famous by its rudbari textiles, and
Rudbar on the Hilmand, called Paraitakene by Isidorus of Charax; a
third one near Djiruft in Lar. The second part, “Zoroaster is born
there,” comes from the commentary to Raga zara^ukris in Fzi.1,15.
Thus, the commentaries to VU.i (with Raga) and 19 (without name)
come from the same source, from which also the passage in Sahr.Er.
comes, and this tradition—although the Gr.Bdh. says “river in Eranvez”
—had not this “home of the Aryans” in mind, but only Raga.
zbarah designates a part of the palace. Whether it be the broken
entrance, dargah, or the vaulted main hall, drjy at any rate is no name
and no river. It may be a mere adjective, e.g. drajyah, comp, of drga
“long,” or a term of fortification, see under ‘Architecture.’ The pas
sage of F/^/.i 9,4 and ii means “in the drjy at the zbarah” or “in the
drjy zbarah of the palace of Purusaspa,” and the palace is imagined
to be in Raga.
To this tradition belongs a tale in the Denhfirt vii (ed. Darab xin,
25!?.), concerning Duydova, Zoroaster’s mother. The Aw. form of
this name appears only in an ungrammatical fragment of the Hat.
Nasl^; the Pahl. form is Duydav; it says: Zoroaster’s father sent her
“6 spitrasp pitar e dutak e andar spitaman deh e apar raya rotastak,
to Spitrasp, the paterfamilias, who was in the country of the Spitama
in the district Raga.” District Raga in the province of the Spitama is
in agreement with deh e x^es of Y.19,18 and with Ctesias’ remark
about the Spitama in Media. The notion that Zoroaster’s father went
on to live in his father’s house after being married is genuine.
Finally the much revealing proverb which the C^it. Zdtsp. 16,12
attribute to Zoroaster’s mother: “I shall not do this, even if the two
towns would meet here, Ray and Tos,” explained: “irreal, 60 farsakh
[in fact good 60 double farsakh] from one another, Zartust ac Ray,
Vistasp ac Notar but, Z. was from Ray, V. from [Tos e]N68ar.” The
last town is near modern Mashhad, famous as the birthplace of Fir
dausi.
That is the Iranian tradition about the home of Zoroaster.



HOUSE SPITAMA 65
Nyberg, who first allows “einen schwachen Reflex zarathustrischer
Lokaltradition” in the personal and geographical names of the Zoro
aster biography of Denl{. vii—that is not the source and hence indiffer
ent—continues “Alles fallt zusammen, wenn wir zu horen bekommen,
Zarathustra sei in Adharbaidjan, genauer in Shez am Urmiya-See
geboren, und dass seine iranische Heimat Eranvez sei.”
Many Greek towns claimed to be the home of Homer. The similar
claim of Sez is disposed of in a few words. Sez < cecista is one of the
oldest fire temples of Media, the “aSargusnasp, Fire of the Stallion,”
shape of appearance of Vrthragna. It is pre-Zoroastrian and one of the
devadana destroyed by Xerxes. One could gather much information
from the legends of the great fires. They like to usurp events of the
religious history. The claim of Sez has the same tendency, but appears
only as late as a.d. 1225 in Yaqut and a.d. 1275 in Qazwini. Before
that time, e.g. in ibn Khurdadhbih, about 860, Tabari, end of the 9th
century, and ibn Faqih, about 910, it is Urmiya. This conception is
connected with the political attitude, at first wavering, of the Muham
medan government towards Magism, which caused that Zoroaster, in
order to make him acceptable to the Muslims, was connected with
the Old Testament. This was done by primates like Aturfarnabag son
of Farru^zad and his son Zartuxst, Atropatenians,"^ and the special
figures to whom Zoroaster became assimilated were Abraham and the
prophet Jeremiah.^’*
The Arab, name of the last is Armiya, in Tabari (1,506) also Urmiya,
and the resemblance of these names led to Urmiya as place of Zoro
aster’s origin. Later Urmiya was replaced by the more important temple
of Sez near the Urmiya Lake. That is no Iranian tradition at all, but
an invention made in order to enjoy some advantages of the ahl al
dhimma, like lower taxes, and not to perish entirely.
The other assertion is wrong: we are nowhere told that Zoroaster’s
West Iranian home was Eranvez. Yt.^io^ and Y/.9,24, to which these
words refer, are unauthentic products of the Arsacid period, as dis
cussed above. In Iranian tradition, down to the Muhammedan period,
Eranvez is never anything but the aboriginal home, the country on
Cf. Den^., end of book ni, and under ‘Zoroaster’s Death.’ 25 That is why the “lord” of the Kuh i Khwaja is called Sara i Ibrahim, viz. Ibrahim Zardust, and why remarks appear like “The prophet Daniel was Cyrus’ maternal uncle” or “Bahman's mother was a Jewess of the house of king Saul,” influenced by the book of Esther.

the Oxus and laxartes, see under ‘Eranvez.’ But not a single ancient
passage connects Zoroaster with Eranvez.
There is only one consistent tradition from the second century B.a,
not more than 250 years after Ctesias, that Raga was the birthplace
and the property of Zoroaster. At that time, the surname zara^ustris
was already old. The Videvdad describes Raga with its hyperscepsis
as the Greek town Europos. That was not the time to claim the glory
to be the prophet’s birthplace. The surname is older and the tradition
must be older. The town that had banished the prophet—see under
‘Hospitium’—can only have gloried in being his home just after
the public recognition of his doctrine, in order to cleanse itself of the
slur, or for fear.
Nyberg, 49: “Im Westen fehlt eine authentische ortliche Uber
lieferung ganzlich, die Lokalisierungen von Ereignissen des Lebens
Zarathustras zeigen durch ihre Unbestimmtheit und ihr Schwanken,
dass sie Konstruktionen sind, so muss man sich grundsatzlich darauf
einrichten, die Gatha-Gemeinde und Zarathustras Heimat in Ostiran
zu suchen.” In the East there is not only no authentic tradition, but
none at all. Raga, as birthplace, is definite and unvacillating; it is no
“construction,” as e.g. the “Gatha-Gemeinde” and the “Hauptmissions
station Raga”; and the “systematic orientation” to find a wanted result
is what one must never do. 401: “Und so kommen die Mystifikationen
auf, die die alten dstlichen Orte im Westen verortlichen. Daraus folgt,
dass die ganze westliche Uberlieferung fiber die Ortlichkeiten des ost
lichen Zoroastrismus geschichtlich gesehen wertlos sind.”
That stands at the beginning (p.49) and at the end (p.401) and is
“von Anfang bis zu Ende verkehrt” (p.202). There are neither eastern
localities and eastern tradition, nor a western localization of eastern
localities of the life of Zoroaster. The whole terminology is wrong.
There is only an Iranian and no Turkistanian tradition, not only about
the life of Zoroaster, but about everything. Some indications in the
gathas can be interpreted as referring to Raga, Komis and Tosa; in
the Awesta some old passages refer equally to Tosa and besides to
Sistan. And there is, later, the definite tradition, old already in the 2nd
century b.c., that Zoroaster was from Raga which belonged to his
family, that the Spitama, therefore, were, as Ctesias says, a Median
house.



IV. HOUSE NOTARYA
“avahyaradi vayam haxamanisiya ^ahyamahi, therefore we are called Achaemenids”
The real family name of kavi Vikaspa, the protector of Zoroaster,
does not appear at all in the Awesta, or in the epics. At the four places
in the gatha there is no reason for Zoroaster to mention the name, to
him a matter of course. In the memorial document of Yr.13, Vikaspa
is no more characterized by the family name than are the Sasanian
kings in their inscriptions.^ But in the following group, §102, before
the first man of another family, the Haugava, appears, a man bear
ing the OPersian name Visatarus, known also from the epical fragment
Y/.5,76, is designated by the clientela adjective “notaryano,” and this
confirms a surmise—for other reasons—that the group between Vis
taspa and the Haugava are the Notarya.
notara < ‘navatara, is the comparative of “nava, new.” The positive
occurs only in Vid.2i,y. “the waters, plants, medicinal herbs become
new,” i.e. renovate, rejuvenate themselves, “by rain.” The comparative
occurs in y/.i7,55—see below—“the Tura, swift horsemen and youthful
ones.” Only because Bartholomae believed the phonetic detail of the
Aw. text to be authentic and the interpretations of the Bdh. and Den\.
to be based on independent knowledge, could he explain this word as
produced “durch Verschiebung des Wortakzents aus *notara, n.pr.
eines Sohnes des Manusci^ra.” Such a Notara, unknown to the Awesta,
never existed; MP. noSar is, like Vezan and others, nothing but the old
surname personified.
Being the comparative of an adjective, notara—quite independent
from its signification—is no heros eponymos and no true family name,
and the single member of the house is not “a Notara.” In the prayer
of Hutosa, Y/.5,98, “vis ndtaranam, clan of the notara” is the name
of the place they owned. Individuals are designated, as in other IE. lan
guages, by the derivative in -iya: notarya, thus in Y/.i 5,35, where the
“notaryaho, notarians,” appear beside the haugavaho, whom the gatha,
too, connect with Vikaspa. From notarya again the IE. adj. of clientela
in -ana, notaryana, is formed, just as in Lat. Julus, Julius, Julianus.
^ The absence of these names is usually not realized; E. G. Browne once said to me: I am glad that just you found for the first time the name Sasanakan in an inscription.



HOUSE NOTARYA
68
There is only the adjective “notara, the veonepof, notarya, one of the
notarya; and notaryana, client of the notarya,” but there is no man
Notara and there are no 'Notarids, ' pecoTepiBaL. The notaryano bears
an Old Persian name; there are not a few Persians round Vistaspa in
the list; some foreign clients, in §§125-126, even have assumed or re
ceived Old Persian names, hence one may expect from the beginning
that the notarya were Persians.
The comparative signification of notara determines one branch of
an unnamed great family in opposition to another branch whose deter
minative must have been an antonym of notara. Gr. vecoTepo^ can be
antonym of various words. Lommel, in Idg.Forschg. 53, 1935, 1655.,
tried to prove by reason of metrics that notara could not be ved)T€po<;
—which is entirely beyond the argumentative power of metrics—and
that Ir. nava meant only “new,” not “young” as in Greek—which is
not provable, since the word occurs only once in the Videvdad passage
quoted above. On the contrary, it is disproved by the true signification
of the comparative notara in 7^.17,55.
Names of branches of great families are found everywhere, in Iran
precisely in the two families most closely connected with the notarya,
viz. the Spitama, called also hecataspana and zara^ustri, and the
Haugava, also called zamaspana, zamaspi (see under ‘Haugava’).
There is no occasion for mentioning the very gentilicium which the
surnames qualify, and less so for mentioning the surname of the other
branch in the Awesta, a fact which does not rule out the possibility
that individuals belonging to that branch appear.
The Achaemenids, too, had two branches; Darius speaks of them
as “dvita.parnam, in two lines”; those were vecoTepot and irpecr^vrepoi.
The family name itself, haxamanisiya, is derived from Darius’ sixth
ancestor Ha^amanil^ The separation was effected by his two grand
sons, Cyrus I and Aryaramna, and in the inscription of the latter
haxamanisiya is not yet used; it appears for the first time on the gold
tablet of his son Rsama.® It takes a few generations to develop such a
- The stem of haxamanis cannot be determined, because, like Aw. vandarmanis OP
ardumanis. it appears only in the nominative. The .sen. haxamanisahya in the Aryaramna
inscription is an early example of analo.sic inflection, like xsaya.rsahya (time of Artaxerxes I)
and darasas’/osahya (.Artaxerxes It). The stem was perhaps -mansah (cf. vanjah) transferred
into the i-c!ass in analo.cy to -sah > -us, transferred into u-class, cf. under ‘Memor. Doc. ’ visatarus. 3 Since the gold tablet of Aryaramna was “gebrandmarkt” as an antique fake, no collection

gentilicium, and just when this was done it became also necessary
to distinguish the two branches.
The Greeks have not transmitted the distinguishing surname
“Hystaspids” of the younger branch that we give the descendants
of Vikaspa. But the Iranian term for the older branch is hidden in the
names MapSot and Mapd^toi of the Greek tradition. Herodotus 1,125
says of the yivea of the Persians: “These are the tribes on which all
other Persians depend: Pasargadai, Maraphioi and Maspioi; among
them the Pasargadai are the noblest, from which the kings of Persis
descend.”* “Depend” in the political sense, is opposed to ethnic
“descend.” The “kings of Persis” are a clan of the tribe Pasargadai.
But opposed to “kings of Media” this expression sounds as if Herod
otus’ source was older than 550 b.c.—He enumerates further among
the nomads of Persis (Pars) the Mardoi between Da(h)oi and
Dropikoi, Sagartioi. Arrian, Ind. 40, from Nearch, mentions Mardoi
as neighbors of the Persians, and Ctesias calls Cyrus a “Mardos as to
his tribe (descent).”
Nomadic Mardoi in Persis are subject to doubt, since the Da(h)oi,
Dropikoi and Sagartioi all belong certainly not to Persis, and the Mar
doi are well known in Mazandaran on the Caspian. Andreas believed
that Ctesias’ Mardos, as ethnic of Cyrus, referred to those anaryan
Amardoi who left their name to the town Amul, and that these were
the Elamite Hapirti. The last name is in reality Ha(l)tamti, and the
theory is twice wrong. The fault in Ctesias’ words is only the rendering
of Ir. “vis, clan” by Gr. genos. The Pasargadai were the “genos,” the
Mardoi the “vis.” The right translation of “vis” by (^prjrpTj occurs only
as exception in Greek, in Herodotus 1,125. iv,i67 he mentions one
Amasis, dvrjp UacrapydSr]^ beside Badres, dH)p Mapdi^tov; the latter
name is that of a vis, like Mardos. Stephanus says yet more inexact, s.v.
Maraphioi: edvo? iv TlepcriSi (from Herodotus) and explains: d-n-o
dared to purchase a similar tablet of R0ma, and this remained unpublished; known to me from a photograph. Rsama calls himself aryaramna-xsa>a 0 yahya-pud'‘a, and moreover haxamanisiya, whereas Aryaramna says “grandson of Haxamanis.” The land Parsa has instead of the usual huvaspa humartiya, the else unknown epithet “hukara huvaspa,” where hukara is new and rightly precedes huvaspa. ^ Nyberg, 343: “Maraphioi and Maspioi sind sicher nicht iranisch; sie enthalten das elam. Suffix -pi und smd also wahrscheinlich als elamisch anzusehen.*’ The El. suffix would have more power than to make the names only “probably Elamite’’; but if so, it could not make them “certainly non-Iranian.” In fact, the names do not contain an Elam, suffix, which is -ip (plur.), but only the phoneme -pi-.

MapacjiLov ^axrLki(it<; (from Eusthatius, Comm, to Ilias 11,408) “Mara
phios, first king of the Persians, son of Menelaos.” This is the per
sonified name of a royal family, like the “notara > NoSar” of the
Sasanian legend.
Mardos and Maraphios reflect the same Iranian word in two dialects,
just as Mardos, Merdis on the one hand, Maraphis, Merphis on the
other, render the OP. form BrSya and Med. Brzya of the name of
Cyrus’ son (see below). Ctesias’ remark is legendary, based on a wrong
interpretation of the name, and yet it is not wrong that Cyrus was a
“Mardos as to his genos.” The comp, notara requires an antonym, and
the comp. barSyah, barzyah is such an antonym, “higher.” Derivatives,
corresponding to notarya and notaryana, may have been the Ir. designa
tion for the “elder branch” of the family. NP. “buland < brzant, high”
is also used for age. Other languages render the same opposition by
younger and older, vecLrepo's and ‘npecrjivTepo’;, and that is the mean
ing of the Iranian words in this case.
Surely the Persians called their Hystaspids notarya, surely the Aw.
notarya expresses the opposition to brzyaho of the same family, whose
very name was so obvious that it was not necessary to mention it.
Surely the never mentioned name was haxamanisiya.

Vistaspa mit [Vistaspa] dem Vater Darius’ I gleich. . . . Diese
Hypothese scheitert indessen rettungslos daran, dass die . . . Gleich

Zoroaster appear under Vistaspa, 258 years before Alexander. A short
period only separates the Awestic Vistaspa from Alexander, that
means he is considered as the historical Vikaspa. The epic—a popular,
not religious tradition—tells the legends that grew round the Awestic
Vikaspa and his relatives—cf. y/.i3—and joins to them without gap
Dara = Darius and his successors to the time of Alexander; it identifies
the two Vistaspa. Religious and epical tradition, that is all tradition
there was, are unanimous in this fundamental equation. It is a colossal
mistake to believe, “unthinkable” could dispense with a thought as
cribed to H. and H., while it was the dominant thought, and the only
one, for 2,500 years.—Let alone individual faculties, “thinkable and

Darius, son of VikaSPa says: “aSabara huvaSabara ahmi, as horse
man I am a good horseman”; OP. asa against Med. aspa. Huvaspa in
the protocol formula “the land with the good horses” and nn.ppr. like
Vistaspa, Aspacina, all contain the Median aspa.
The meaning of vista results from y/.5,98:
tarn yazanta hvovaho to her (Ardvi), the Haugava
sacrificed,
tarn yazanta notaryaho to her the Notarya sacrificed,
istim yaSyanta hvovo for riches the Haugava asked,

The language is bad, the composition of the verses not that of the
old-mythical ones, and the lack of a locality—never missing in genuine
stanzas—^is alone sufficient proof that the insignificant fragment is not
old. The poet makes the Haugava ask for money, with respect to the
Gath, attribute “ikois hvarna, blessed with riches” of the Haugava
Zamaspa, and makes the Notarya ask for “horses’ speed”—a bad abstr.
formation—^remembering Y/. 17,55-56, “Flight of Rtis”:
yat mam tura pazdayanta asu.aspa notarasca
“when the Tura chased me, the swift-horsemen and nbtara, youthful
ones.” He regards asu.aspa as an attribute of notara, identifies this with
the family name, notarya, of Vikaspa, and makes Vistaspa win the
speediest horses, because that is his interpretation of the name.—vika

Darius’ father and Zoroaster’s protector bear the same Median name,
which—excepting a few younger Achaemenids—does not occur in his
tory down to the Muhammedan epoch, when it became popular by
Firdausi’s Shahnamah. Median names for Persians are quite unobjec
tionable. But those who believe in an “eastern Vistaspa” reject with
equal emphasis the theory that he had a Median name and that the
Medes knew him, because that would break through the barrier
erected between the “eastern Awesta” and the Medes and Persians.
The Medes—if that concept is right—must have used the name with
out any contact; Rsama must have given it to his son unknowingly;
and Vistaspa II, grandson of the historical Vistaspa, must have called
his son with the unique name Pissouthnes < Pisisyo^na, without
knowing that the “eastern Vistaspa” had done the same, see under
‘Throne-names.’ This triple coincidence is “unthinkable.” And the
fact that the two persons bear the same Median name proves in this
special case that both are one and the same Persian. As a Persian, Vis
taspa orders masses to be celebrated for so many Persians in the founda
tion document of his temple.
Nyberg,249: “Sein Vater hiess aurvataspa.” This passage, y/.5,io5,
is spurious, it is the empty prayer of Zoroaster, in erudite language,
always to pursue “the son of Arvataspa, the swift, kavian Vistaspa”
etc., which we have characterized above, a worthless product of the
Arsacid period.
Apart from this passage, “arvataspa, with swift horses” appears only
as standing epithet of the gods ApamNapat and Hvar Xseta; cf. Nep
tunus equester. In the OP. version of the legend, to which Hellanicus
(430-400 B,c., frgm.163) alludes, long before the date of the Awestic
prayer, Atossa-Hutdsa, too, is called “daughter of Ariaspes,” i.e. '‘ary
aspes < OP. 'arvaspa. In the later versions the divine epithet is replaced
by Luhrasp, name of the god APOOAzno of the Kushan coins, i.e.
“druvaspa, with healthy horses,” with EastIr. 8 > 1 . In the Awesta,
Yasht 9 is dedicated to the goddess Druvaspa. In both cases, the sur
name has displaced the lost proper name.
The whole legend which the post-Zoroastrian period has woven
around Vistaspa is the rejuvenation of an older myth of gods, which
made a hero arvataspa, of the god with that surname. This hero



HOUSE NOTASYA 73,
melted together with the East Iranian god druvaspa into the figure of
king Luhrasp. Markwart, Vehrot, was inclined to see ApamNapat in
him. But we do not have the old myth, but only the heroized legend,
into which historical figures intruded, and seeing original deities of
water in all the figures of this cycle is going much too far.
The home of the god Druvaspa prevails as locality of this legend.
From such an origin, the notion passed into all pseudo-historical
stories, that the Iranian kings Luhrasp and Vistasp resided in Balkh, as
overlords of Assyrian and Babylonian kings, e.g. of Nebuchadnezzar
(see under ‘Zoroaster’s Death’). This notion is so old that it appears
already in a branch of Greek tradition which makes Ninus wage war
against Hystaspes and Zoroastres in Bactria.
The real hero of the Vistaspa legend is not Vistaspa, but his brother
Zarivaris-Zarer, of the memorial document in who, in Yt.5,ii2f.,
bears the epithet “aspa.yoSa, fighting on horseback,” well fitting into
the group.® The god druvaspa-arvataspa-equester attracts such names.
What the Awesta quotes of Vistaspa himself is poor: he immolates a
hundred sheep to Ardvi, praying for victory over Tan^ryavant (not
traceable in the later legend, nor in the old myth) and Arjataspa; the
place is the lake Frazdanu in Zranka-Slstan.^
In y#.5,ii2, Zarivaris, too, immolates a hundred sheep: satam . . .
anumayanam pasne apo datiyaya.® The locality, the river Datiya, is
insignificant, copied from old myths. The prayer runs: “that I may be
victorious
prtacingam astakanam humayakam devayasnam
druvatamca arjataspam ahmi ‘^ge^ai (text: ge^e) prtanahu
over Humayaka with-the-spread-out-claws, haunting-in-a-cave, the
devayasnian, and over the drugvant Arjataspa, in the fight for his
family.”
In the still later form of the same legend in Yt.%7^ 1 , we find instead
of the last words
uta azam fra.rvesyani *humaye ‘'vrSanakeca
® With elements reversed *yu5i.aspa in n.pr. Oidid<rjnjs, Ctesias, in history of Parysatis. ^ yr.9,29-31 is only a corrupt amplification of this stanza. ® pasne, “angesichts?,” Lommel “hintcr',” only in Yt.^, and only referring to water (Cecista, Pisinah, Frazdanu and Datiya) is perhaps Old Persian, cf.

The two feminine names were originally in dvandva form. Humaya
is a name of Achaemenian ladies, Amyites. Here, two kidnapped
women are brought home. In the older ©retona myth, y/.5,34, the
motif—if “azani” means only “to carry away, abduct”—was the rape
of women:
uta he vante azani and I may carry away the two be

and rnavan; the Shahnamah Sahrinaz and Arnavaz.
To the same legend belong the verses in ¥^.5,76, where the notary ano
Visatarus prays “upa apam (yam) vetahvatim, on the river V.” (“rich

Athenaeus b. 13,575, quotes the story from Chares of Mytilene {Alex.
b.io) as example of a couple that never met, but saw each other in a
dream, a motif that lives on in 1001 Nights, for instance in the story
of Qamar al-zaman and the daughter of the king of the Djaza’ir with
her seven castles. The legend was so popular at Alexander’s time, that
it was often told and pictured in houses and palaces, and many named
their daughters after the heroine. How quickly the legend worked can
be measured by Ctesias’ attributing the Bistun monument to Semiramis
only 120 years after its creation. Also by Herodotus’ telling of the
myth of the seven walls of Kanha as an historical description of
Agbatana, which at that time was only 230 years old.
Hystaspes had a younger brother Zariadres, whom the “epichorians”
called a son of Aphrodite and Adonis. Hystaspes was king of Media
and the Lower Country (Erag, ‘Iraq), Zariadres king of the countries
above the Caspian Gates as far as the Tanais. Beyond the Tanais ruled
Homartes, king of the islapad&v^' who had a daughter Odatis. Zari
varis and Zariadres are two different names.^^ As in the case of arvaspa
and druvaspa, two figures are blended into one. Aphrodite stands for
Ardvl, and Adonis, god of vegetation, evidently for Druvaspa, god of
the animal kingdom. Homartes wants to marry his daughter to one
of his grandees, but Zariadres, alone with his charioteer, drives through
the Tanais and arrives just in time to rescue the bride. The anonymous
charioteer of Chares of Mytilene, hence, is Visatarus of the yasht. The
expression “ahmi ge^yai prtanahu” alludes to the abduction. The
theme of the original myth was not the rescue of the bride, but the
rape of two women; in the later form, with Humaya and VrSanaka
instead of Sahava;s(s and Arnava^s, it was the bringing home of
abducted women.
Tanais stands for the Ranha, because Alexander believed the laxartes
to be the Tanais-Don. The Gr.Bdh. 86, 88 and 91, does not equate the

Nyberg considers the often discussed myth of the “Flight of Rtis,”

sacrificial rule which forbids people not yet mature or no longer pro

the neck of a ram, evidently not like Odysseus when fleeing from the
cave of Polypheme, but like sorceresses in looi Nights, transformed
into an insect. Both times she is discovered and frustrated by immature
boys and girls. Wolfgang Schultz was right in pointing out that at
the second occasion it must be the senile people that discover her, and
that the third incomplete stanza, with which the story stops short
before a gap, must be the third and successful attempt.
The myth might be an etiologic one, motivating the sacrificial rule,
or rather a description of the same qualities of the goddess which are
the cause of this rule. There is no place and no allusion in it to more
than one tribe; on the contrary, the children and the old people are all
of one kind, anaryan Tura. Tura and notara are not two names, but
one name with an appellative, notara is not the gentilicium notaryaho,
but the regular comparative of “nava red?,” referring to the contrasted
ages, “the comparatively young Tura, the youthful (among them).”
asu.aspa describes them as on horseback.^®
Nyberg connects this story of the immature children with his idea
that Zoroaster, in the “Wedding Gatha” (see under ‘Maga’) —though
in vain—had tried to substitute his own daughter Purucista as “God
dess of Fertility” for Rtil The myth would prove the comprehensible
“resistance of the Mithra-community against this innovation,” and the
“dunkle Blatt” thus becomes a “sehr bedeutsamer religionsgeschicht
licher Vorgang.” The flight of the goddess is not a tale specific for
Rtis, but a primeval myth widely spread over the world; in Iran,
there was a variant in the tale of the flight of the goddess of Earth
before the dragon AziDahaka-Frahrasya. On no account is it a “Vor
gang” based on real actions of historical or half-historical persons. It
was aeons old before Vistaspa and 2k>roaster were born, and one can
cheerfully tear the “dark page” from the family chronicle of the No
tarya. There were enough skeletons in the closet.
An independent proof for the identity of the two Vikaspa follows
from their place of residence: the Vistaspa of the inscriptions was
satrap of Parthava, the capital of which was Tosa, later Tos e Nodaran
<*t6sa notaranam. And the residence of the Awestic Vistaspa was.
This explains the misunderstanding in yr.5,98, where asu.-aspa is taken as appellative of notara, this as nStarya. Ved. tura means “quick, wJd.”

according to Yt.^i'y “viso awi notaranam, the vis of the Notara,” in
the fragment of the legend dealing with Hutosa-Atossa. This place can
be determined, and for that purpose one needs the figure of Tusa in
Y/.5,53-57, who is not an old-mythical, but an historical figure of the
Vistaspa circle.
In Y;.5,53, the “swift ra^esta, chariot-fighter, Tusa” brings offerings
“brsesu pad aspanam” and prays for victory over the “valiant Vesaki
sons, hunavo vesakaya^^ upa dvaram "'ca^rusukam apanatamam kan
haya brzantiya rtavniya.” Tusa furthermore desires victory over all
Tura. The Vesaki are Tura, but their town, Kanha, is always called
rtavan, for reasons unknown, but certainly in the oldest, pre-Zoroas
trian connotation of the term, approximately to be rendered by “just.”
In St. 57, on the contrary, the Vesaki sons pray “upa dvaram ""ca^ru
sukam etc.” for victory over Tusa and over all Aryans. In this legend,
created shortly after the time of Zoroaster, the Vesaki are a vis and bear
an historical name. For vesaka is written on a seal of the Achaemenian
epoch with the picture of a horseman, dismounted, hunting a boar,
and with the legend vysk. This fine seal belonged to the vispatis of the
family, about 400 b.c. The name vesaki, -“kaya, is a gentilic, derivative
of vesaka, this again short-form of a compound with vrddhi of vis
as first element, as in vaisapu^ra, cf. bevarpati, *spa8apati as family
names.
Their locality is broadly described: “at the gate, the market, the
distant one, in Kanha,” meanmg a famous building: in the legend
as told already by Herodotus, Kanha was the prototype of the “town
with seven walls” (see under ‘Architecture’).
In the late Sasanian legend, the name of the Vesak who gave his
daughter to Siyavuxs is Piran, and Biruni records in his akjibdr
Khwdrizm^^ that Fil, i.e. Pir, was the old name of the capital Gurganj.
The Vesaki are Tura, and Tur was a district of Khwarizm according
to Moses of Chorene. This gives the Vesaki as “lords of Pir in
Khwarizm and their place Kanha as Gurganj. In the Karter mscrip
int is not permissible to restore +vasaka for metrical reasons; the verses are weak in
language and meter, vysky means vesakavo. The seal in the Brit.Mus., in cisem., ii, n.89,

tions a figure called “kangopet, lord of Kang?” seems to play the role
of Virgil in Dante. The NP. form is Gang, for a mythical place only.
The etymology of the name is obscure, “antara.kanha, between, within

Kang and Miyan-Kang, i.e. antara.kanha, are partial names of the
Hilmand delta in Sistan, and one would expect a signification con
nected with water. Below Gurganj, the Oxus delta begins.
If the Turyan Vesaki have an historical background, the more so the
Iranian Tusa. In y/.5,53, he brings his offerings “at the necks of the
horses, praying for health of the bodies,” both in plural. These verses
imitate the original in Y/.io,ii, where the “ra^estaro brsesu pati as
panam, the chariot fighters, standing at the necks of their horses” pray
for “force of the two-horse teams, integrity of (their) bodies.” There,
the plural is right, and the author of 5,53 has failed to adapt his model
correctly. The kind of faults resembles those in the inscriptions of Arta
xerxes II, and the date of the verses agrees therewith: end of the 5th
century b.c.
Tusa is not “eine Kollektivbezeichnung fiir ein Adelsgeschlecht,”
Nyberg, 259, because that would require an adj. gent, like *tusiya,
‘tosiya. Sasanian tradition knows nothing about Tusa, but speaks of
Tos e noSaran, where Tos is an adjective, noSaran a gen.pl. There
was never a Tos nor a NoSar, and Tos was no “heros eponymus eines
mit dem kavi-Hause nahe verschwagerten Geschlechts.” Nyberg, 357:
“Man hat die Genealogien der Alten immer mit der notigen Kritik
zu verwenden.” Compared with the Sasanian genealogies of heroes
and priests—all epithets transfigured into fathers, sons and brothers

the begat-chapters of Genesis are a reliable source of history. Arab
genealogists like ibn al-Kalbi work similarly, arranging all names of
old towns, rivers, canals in pedigrees of men. But, so far, nobody has
recognized “nahe verschwagerte Geschlechter” in these topic names.
Tusa is an historical figure, for he gave his name to the capital of
Parthava, Tosa > NP. Tus, famous by the tomb of Firdausi. Tos e
NoSaran, first “spahpet of Tos,” a military title like bevarpati as title
of the Danavo in Ya 13,38, is not the man Tusa, but the town called
after him. Firdausi still uses noSaran correctly as plural: “sahr i
noSaran Tos, Tos, city of the NoSaran.”^’’ In the Cit.Zdtsp. 16,12 the
Shahnamah Vullers 1086,49; 1109,770; cf. Noldeke, Iran.Nat.Epos. p.8.

proverb “not if the two cities Ray and NoSar would meet here” is ex
plained by “Zoroaster was from Ray, Vistasp from NoSar.” Such a
proverb has an historical background. The man Tos e noSaran is the
result of a misinterpretation of the name of the town; therefore the
legend has nothing to say about this name. Of necessity it becomes a
brother of Vistahm e NoSaran, i.e. the client Visatarus notaryano trans
formed into a “son of NoSar.” The purpose of this invention is appar
ent: a genealogy had to be created for the Arsacid family of the Spah
pet of Tos, the predecessors of the Kanarang, as the Sahr.Er. expressly
state: “The town Tos is founded by Tos e NoSaran; for 900 years
he was spahpet;"” after Tos, the dignity of spahpet came to Zarer,
after Zarer to Bastvar, from him to Kurazm.” Perhaps the Spahpet
were actually descendants of Tusa, but these names are taken from
the memorial list of Y/.13: the family of Vihdspa became a dynasty of
Tos, the residence of the historical Vistaspa.
In Y/. 15,35 Hutosa prays “viso awi notaranam”—the obligatory de
termination of the locality—“that I may be dear, beloved and esteemed,
patizanta, in the nmana of kavi Vistaspa.” nmana is the small family,
a number of which constitute the vis, at the same time their residence,
house or palace. Here vis is the place, nmana the familia; for Hutosa
does not want to be loved by buildings, patizanta is the model of NP.
taM, and implies as what she wants to he “esteemed, honored,”-"
namely as “nmanapa^ni > banbisn,” title of the Sasanian queens.
Vistaspa is the vispatis of the Notarya, hence notaranam as surname
of his residence. Vis signifies the men of the clan, their residence and
property. In the OP. inscriptions, Persepolis and Agbatana are called
vi^, as residence of the Hystaspids. Thus vis becomes “town.” Vis
notaranam is Firdausi’s hhr i noSaran. Vis notaranam and *tosa nota
ranam, the residence of the Notara, are identical. The Aw. vis
notaranam is, like arya.kyanam for aryanam ^sa^ram, the poetical
expression, intelligible for everyman, for the capital of Parthava, Tosa, where Hutosa prayed.

protector Vistaspa. The same town was the residence of the historical
Vistaspa as satrap of Parthava according to the inscriptions.
The traditional legends of the temples that claim to be founded by
Vikaspa agree with the inscriptions, the Awesta and the epics, and
the memorial list of Y/.13 proves the historical fact that Vistaspa had
founded such temples. One of them was the Kishmar temple, see under
‘Chronology.’

Hvarnahvant (cDH’vmnd) in Xwarizm on its cubic place. When they

hand of Dahak. Under the reign of Vistaspsah, by a revelation of the
religion, it was transferred from Xvarizm to the Rosan kof in the

the Gr.Bdh., 9.SCI. a.d. or of its source.?].
Procopius deals with the xavapdyyai, Bell.Pers. Bonn p.5, 7 and 23, on
the authority of Kavat, son of Jam, an elder brother of Xusrau II. Since
the time of Balash, a.d. 484-488, they had been margraves of Nishapur,
SW. of Tbs; there, the Arabs knew them still during and after the
conquest as kanarang or banu Kanara, cf. Ydqut 11,411. According to
ibn Khurdadhbih, “kunar” was the “title” of the king of Nishapur.
The name of the mountain, which can also be read royen, refers to
Aw. “roSita, copper mountain” in Y/.i9,2, written rvosn’vmnd in the
Gr.Bdh. The legend (cf. Mas‘udl iv,75) rightly treats the words “pa
petakih ac den” as meaning that the old fire had been forgotten and
had to be rediscovered “by order of Zoroaster.” In fact, the temple was
not older than Vistaspa’s time, and its place was in the Nishapur dis
trict.
Gr.Bdh. 125: “When Zoroaster brought the religion . . . , Vistaspa
put the aSar-burzenmihr on its cubic place on mount Revand, which
is also called pust e Vibaspan.” That is the revant of Yt.ig,6 -, Gr.Bdh.:
“u.s revand nam ku rayawmand,” and p.8o: “mount Vinapet” is to
gether with the pub e Vibaspan; from there to revand, where the

Xusrau defeated the Vesak Piran, is probably the transposition of an .‘\rab. broken plur. of gumbaS into Pahlavi: “the cupolas.’’ GumbaS itself is an Ir. loanword from .\ss. qubbatu.

aSarburzenmihr is, are 9 farsakh towards west.” This Revand—another
one lies not far south—is situated northwest of Nishapur not far from
Tos, near the turquoise mines. Yaqut, mudjam 1,628, still notes a dis
trict Pusht in that area.
“pust, back” designates a mountain formation; puk e vistaspan
would be “Vistaspian back” or “back of the Vistaspas,” rather objec
tionable."^ In the legend of the foundation of the fire of Shez in Adhar
baijan, the aSargusnasp sits down, like a corposant, on the mane of
Husravah’s horse,"^ pa busn e asp. That is a Persian etymology of the
Median name “gusnasp < ‘vrsn.aspa, stallion,” which presupposes Pers.
busnasp <*vusnaspa. This form appears on the reverse of late Sasanian
copper coins from Old Shiraz and Bishapur as legend at the side of
the figure of a human-headed bull: busaspan or busnaspan.'° Hence,
it is possible that the name of the mountain pust e vikaspan is a new
interpretation of pust e busnaspan, when the meaning “back of a stal
lion” became obscured and the name was connected with the fact
that Vikaspa had founded the temple.
The Gr.Bdh. goes on: “These fires are ataxs e varhran, dynastic
fires.” One of them must have been the temple in which the original
document of the memorial list was preserved. Thus three temples
which retrace their foundation to Vikaspa lie around Tos.

Hut5sa and Humaya, the ladies of Vistaspa’s family, follow. Both
names appear in the Achaemenid family, the second as name of the
Median mother of Atossa, which Ctesias connects with the Spitamas.
Berossos, in Syncellus, from Eusebius and Polyhistor, renders
Humaya by Amyi'tes, as name of the Median wife of Nebuchadnezzar,
a better form than Amytis.“ The later legend mixes Amyites with
Semiramis, occasionally also with Khutos-Atossa."' The name persists
in the Achaemenid family: e.g. Amytis, daughter of Xerxes and Ames
tris, sister of Artaxerxes I, wife of Bagabu^sa, whose grandson was
called Spitama. It is possible, but not necessary, that the Humaya of
the list was Atossa’s and Zoroaster’s mother. The occurrence of the
name in Yt.g,28, along with VrSanaka, has no other historical signifi
cance but that Achaemenid names infiltrate into the legend.
Herodotus 1,75 and 107, regards Cyrus as grandson of Astyages by
his daughter Mandane, married to Cambyses I. That would be a rela
tionship of the two houses by marriage one generation earlier, but
would not rule out the marriage of Cyrus to another daughter of
Astyages. But “father-in-law” as Ctesias says is better than “maternal
grandfather,” because Astyages, dethroned in 550, can scarcely be of
the same generation as Cyrus I who had a son, at least half grown,
as hostage at the court of Assurbanipal as early as 640 b.c. There are
cases, soon to be mentioned, where children were born as grand-uncles,
but in the case of Astyages and Cyrus the great-grandfather did not
live long enough to make that possible.
The gatha alludes to the two ladies only by calling Cambyses
“bandva, afiEnis, relative-in-law” of Zoroaster.
The name Hutosa, Gr. Atossa, means KaWiviryo^, corresponding to
the ideal of beauty as expressed in representations of women in
Achaemenian and Sasanian art. Her appearance in Yt.g,26, Zoroaster’s
prayer in Arsacid Awestic, is significant for one reason only: the

quotation of gatha 46,7, whereby Hutosa, instead of the Haugava
brothers, becomes the person through whom Zoroaster hopes to obtain
the oflEcial “frasastis, the proclamation” of his recognition. Else, not
counting Y/.13, Hutosa appears only in Y/.i5,35, where she prays to
become honored, as queen, in the family of kavi Vistaspa. These verses
stand in a yasht, hence are no direct historical notice. The task is to
examine how far they depict the situation in a distorted, how far still
in the right way.
The adornment alone of the verses shows, in the luxury it describes,
the character of the period and therewith the date of their composi
tion: before the end of the 5th century b.c. Hutosa prays like a queen
zaranene pati gatou at the golden throne,
zaranene pati fraspati"® at the golden dais,
zaranene pati upastarne at the golden cushion,
on which she is imagined sitting before she rises for her prayer, just
as later the Sasanids and the Umayyads and Abbasids squat on “royal
brocades, dibaj i xusrawani” as cushions and rugs on their chrysele
phantine and canopied thrones.
The identification of Hutosa-Atossa has been rejected as emphatically
as that of Vistaspa-Hystaspes. Nyberg, 358: “Wenn Atossa als Beweis
dafiir dienen kann, dass die genannte Dame einem zoroastrischen
Geschlecht angehdre, so ist jede Ingeborg und Ingegerd . . . ein Beweis
dafiir, dass ihre Vorfahren der uralten . . . Kultgemeinde der Ingvaeo
ninnen angehorten.”—Hertel concluded that the Awestic Vistaspa was
the father of Darius and that Y/.15 alluded to Darius’ marriage to
Atossa. Nyberg: “Es giebt nicht den Schimmer eines Beweises . . .
und nicht einmal Herzfeld heisst das gut. Vistaspas Gattin heisst
Atossa.”
A theory of which not even I approve, must be pretty bad. However,
in this presentation, Atossa would be contemporary with Zoroaster; in
the contested view equally; how, then, could the family have been
Zoroastrian before Zoroaster.? The prayer of Y/.15 does not say that
Hutosa was a sister of Vistaspa, as the “tradition” assumes; nor that
she was his wife; but only that she wished to marry into his narrower

family. Instead of marrying the old vispatis himself, soon to become
dowager lady Notari, she would rather have chosen the heir. Ingvaeo
ninnen would have felt the same.
A man may have more than one main wife (whose children have
full claim to inheritance), and not only in the clan, but in the nmana
there are more than one marriageable man. The man marries young,
at the age of 16; not of necessity at first the main wife. He remains
in the nmana of his father. But one is not vispatis when 16 years old;
that is the eldest member of the clan, sometimes the one oldest in rank.
The vispatis, always old, may go on marrying to his liking, but the
posts of his main wives, the “zataye ge^yai abdatama,” are long since
occupied. All that was exactly the same to the present day. The married
grandson of such a grandee answered, when asked “how is your grand
father.?” only: “les noces continuent.” Atossa has in Yr.15 the two
attributes “azata and purubra^ra.” Many girls had “many brothers,” in
royal families as many as there are days in a year. The above mentioned
grandee, a septuagenarian, questioned how many sons he had, an
swered: “faut demander mon chef comptable.” Then he called into the
garden where far away a dozen boys between 5 and 10 years were play
ing, and said “permettez que je vous presente quelques-uns de mes plus
jeunes enfants.” He knew that the eldest was a grandson, but their
names were unknown to him. Thus, a difference of fifty years is pos
sible between the ages of brothers.
purubra^ra indicates that Hutosa was married to several brothers, as
vice versa the saint Ardaviraz was married to his seven sisters. The
tradition, therefore, regards Hutosa as sister and wife of Vistaspa. Her
attributes are a good description of the homonymous daughter of
Cyrus whose brothers were, according to Ctesias, on the one hand the
sons of Cyrus, on the other those of the Spitama, and who married
some of them. Nyberg, who denies the identity of the namesakes, calls,
357, the historical Atossa—while he makes Hutosa “Zarathustra den
guten Leumund, frasastis, besorgen”—“eine Dame mit bunter Ver
gangenheit, sowohl mit Cambyses, als mit dem Pseudo-Smerdis
verheiratet gewesen,” as though this could reflect on Zoroaster’s
reputation. Perhaps that makes her so interesting; somebody has said:
“interesting are only those men with a future and women with a
past.” But it should be really “colorful”: “mit ihrem Bruder Cambyses,

ihrem pseudo-Bruder Gomata, und iJirem Vetter Darius verheiratet
gewesen.” As Cyrus’ heiress she could have taken every liberty, except
remaining a spinster. The kings had their harem, and for Atossa, too,
her marriages were no love romances, no more than for the beautiful
Musa who, when widowed, married her son Phraates V only 5 years
old, on account of the regency.
The mother of Cambyses II and Smerdis was Kassandane; since
Atossa married Cambyses and the pseudo-Smerdis, she was no daugh
ter of Kassandane. And since Cyrus appointed both sons to succeed
him and the line became extinct with them, he had no son from Asty
ages’ daughter—the one Ctesias calls Amytes—^for he would have been
the heir. The true and the false brother marry their half-sister Atossa
as “azata, agnata,” as the heiress. She was the heiress of Media by her
mother, whose dowry, Ctesias says, was the whole of Media. Amytes
must have been Atossa’s mother. Through her she was even more au
gust than Cambyses and Smerdis. Probably born in 549/8, she was
slightly older than Darius, her third husband, born about 545 b.c.,
whom, as Herodotus says, she dominated completely: 17 yap “'Arocrcra
elx^ ro TTav Kparo?. Therefore it was her son Xerxes who succeeded,
although, as he himself says, there were elder brothers.
Hutosa has left a deep impress on the minds of the people. They do
not only remember that she was the azata and purubra^ra, and linked
in marriage to the family of Vikaspa. In Yt.g,26 the hope is imputed
to Zoroaster that she might obtain for him the frasastil In the Gatha
he hopes to obtain this revocation of his banishment by the ability of
the two Haugava, but nowhere through Vistaspa, his protector. Yt.g
is no Gatha, but the thought must have figured in the legend to which
Y/. 15,35 belongs, and there Hutosa must have been imagined to have
a greater influence on the person granting the frasastis, than even Vis
taspa. Whereas the legend everywhere considers him as an absolute
sovereign, it has here preserved a memory of the fact that he had only
the limited power of a satrap and was subject to a higher power which
Hutosa could better influence: Cyrus or Cambyses. To imagine her as
speaking in favor of Zoroaster may even be a last remembrance of their
relationship. This special relationship can be discussed only after having
determined the word “bandva,” and that requires wider researches.

Atossa’s half-brother Smerdis (Ionic form) is called BrSya in OP.,
rendered by Mardos in Aeschylus, Merdias in a scholion, Merdis in
Trogus. But the Median form is Brzya, brzy of the Pap.EL, rendered
by Maraphis, Merphis in the scholion to Aeschylus’ Pers. 775, from
Hellanicus."'* Brzya is the shortform of a name with “brzi, high” as
first and with suppressed second element. Other shortforms of such a
name are Gr. Mardontes < OP. ’brSvant, and Barzaentes < Med.
brzvant. BrSya’s daughter Parmys was married to Darius and had a
son Ariomardos,‘*° the second element of which is the first of the name
of the grandfather. Such variations of names are general in IE. lan
guages, cf. rsti.-vega: vezi.rstis under ‘Throne-names.’ The suppressed
component of the name may have been rsti. In the memorial list of
y/.i3, brzi.rstis stands beside vezi.rstis, after the brothers and before
the sons of Vistaspa, just as the Franya brothers-in-law, Medes, stand
among the relatives of Zoroaster. Therefore, one is allowed not only to
regard brzi.rstis as the full form of the hyp. Brzya, but to consider the
persons, BrSya of the inscriptions, and Brzi.rstis of the list, as identical.
If his name appears in the document, Smerdis must have joined the
circle around Vikaspa and Zoroaster, as did his sister Atossa. He was
thrown into prison and secretly killed, more likely before Cambyses’
campaign against Egypt, spring 525, than as Herodotus says, during
that campaign. The memorial list can contain his name as that of a
deceased, but at first one must assume that he was still alive at that
date. The connection of Zoroaster with the great events of that period
becomes clearer step by step.
Nyberg calls, e.g. on p.357, the equations “Hutosa = Atossa” and “Vis
taspa = Vistaspa” “den Eckstein der ganzen Konstruktion, die so unsin
nig ist, wie nur etwas sein kann,” a criticism that can result either from
supreme assurance or from great ignorance. His reasons are, p.45 : “Die

His residence is the capital of Parthava, Tosa, and his time the last
decades of the sixth century b.c. Vistaspa, father of Darius, responds to
every detail of that description. The Hutosa of the Awesta is azata,
agnate, purubra^ra, married to brothers of her, related by marriage to
the family of Vistaspa, closely connected with another lady, Humaya,
and has power over the highest instance which Vistaspa cannot influ

is quite a solid foundation of such “cornerstones.” With Pharnakes=:

artes, Artayktes, Artostes, Artembares, Damaspia etc., the gathas and the
Awesta contain about two dozen of names of persons which appear
under the same name in analogous roles in history. Against these facts
no invocation can help, no Ingeborg and Ingegerd, no William of
Orange or Hohenzollern, no Charles of Spain or Sweden.

Herodotus calls the founder of the Median empire Deiokes, i.e.

power behind their coalition (hangmatana?) was a Deiocid Xsa^rita,
Ass. kakariti, zantupatis of KarKassi—this place being the pre-Median
Agbatana.
It was a mistake of W. Kdnig, in aof vii,6, repeated by Nyberg, 334,
to doubt the Iranian character of the name Daiaukku. In the memorial
document of Y/.13 are several names formed with dahyu, jara.dahyu,
atar.dahyu and dahyu.fraSah, dahyu.sruta, and -ukku is an Iranian
dimin. suffix, especially common in high antiquity, e.g. Assyrian an

the name appears in Y/.i3,ioi, at a very prominent place: behind the
brothers and before the sons of Vistaspa, and at the side of brzi.rstis,
BrSya, son of Cyrus. The names around Zoroaster are similarly ar
ranged: first the Franya, brothers-in-law, then the sons. To form the
names of grandfather, father and son of parallel-similar or reversed
equal elements is a general IE. custom, cf. brzi.rhis-BrSya, grandfather
of Tsti.brza >"'Astimardos-Ariomardos. Vezi.rstis, hence, may be a
grandson of Rstivega, Astyages.
The eponym of the Achaemenids is HaxamaniL His son was Cahis
pis, probably the king who led the Persians from their original habitat
in Media into Fars. The members of the elder line of his descendants
bear alternatingly the names Cyrus and Cambyses.
“Weder Cispi noch Kurus sind arische Namen”—thus Nyberg—^has
been said before, e.g. Mas‘udi,11,127: “Some maintain Cyrus’ mother
was a Jewess and the prophet Daniel his maternal uncle.” The El. and
Akk. transliterations of OP. c^" i s p" i s, viz. ci.s.pi.s and si.is.pi.is,
prove a bisyllabic pronunciation in 520 b.c., but allow i or e. The render
ing of OP. "Satovahya by El. ta.t.tu.van.ia and Akk. za.’.tu.’.a proves
the coexistence of an archaic pronunciation '’Satovanhya and a con

temporary zatoveh. It is an error to believe that “OP. cispi had greater
authority than Gr. Tei’spes.” The Greeks, who had a name Thisbe,
had no reason to render bisyllabic Gispis by a trisyllabic Teispes, unless
they heard it. As a rule, the Greeks render the Ir. afiricata c in old names
by t replaces it only under the law of two aspirates; hence, as Mark
wart recognized, reto-TTTj? stands for *^e‘to-7n7? = cahispis > cespis, an
archaic name, resembling ca^snis in Mem.Doc. y/.i3,ii4, and saizdris
<*sayuzdris in 13,113. Phonetics and formation are thoroughly Iranian,
and the man was certainly an Aryan.“
Andreas expressed, at the Hamburger Oriental. Kongress, 1902, the
opinion: “Kurus ist im Ap. ein u-Stamm, im Elam., Akk. und Hebr.
nicht. Nie wird ein Ap. u-Stamm sonst von andren Sprachen in einen
a-Stamm verwandelt. Also ist das a urspriinglich und im Ap. in u
verwandelt, um das charakteristische -s im Nominativ zu erhalten.
Kyros ist also ein Elamit.” So says the book of Daniel and Tabari, 1,656:
Kirus al-'Ailami. Markwart called the assertion at once “lacherlich.”
Berossus, frgm.2, in Alexander Polyhistor, says of Cyrus II: Ilepo-Tj?
wv L$ayeinj^. He must have known a Babylonian document with
“parsa’a mar parsa’a, arri arrisitir.” There is no sense in contesting the
nationality of Cyrus. Andreas started from his special “vowel-theory”
which he wanted to support by the doubly wrong equation: Cyrus a
Mardos = Amardos = Hapirti (cf. above). There was no interest to pre
serve the -s in the nominative (only), and no other foreign a-stems are
changed into u-stems. The first Cyrus is mentioned by Assurbanipal in
639 B.c. (Assur prism, Berlin). Assyrian has a type fu'ul, but no fu'ul,
and assimilates OP. kurus to its type fu‘al :kural The a is insignificant.
The Babylonians assume the Assyrian form, and Hebr. Koras renders
the Akk. form. Cyrus I called his son Cambyses, and the next two
generations consider these names important enough to repeat them.
Cambyses is OP. k b u j i y, Aram, knbvzy, pronunciation kan

considered it as evident; Markwart, uge 11,137, calls them “ethnics,
kurus with vrddhi from kuru”; also Charpentier in zii 11(1923), I44f.
The Rgveda knows only a n.pr. kuru.sravana, but in later literature the
kuru are frequently mentioned, often together with Gandhara and
Bahlika. Asoka’s rule extended over Kamboja and Yona (Graeco
Bactria)," and the Buddhist “List of Sixteen Nations” contains the
Kuru, and, at the end, Gandhara and Kamboja.® The Jataka describe
the latter as great horsebreeders, one tells of their killing of insects,
snakes, frogs and vermin, considered to be a religious merit.® The gram
marian Yaska (500 b.c. ?) quotes the word “savati, he goes” as proof
that their dialect was foreign, and this is indeed OIr. savati, not 01 .
cyavate.” The Mahabharata enumerates them with Andra, ^aka (in
Arachosia), Yavana (in Gandh^a), and Vahlika (in Bactria), and tells
of Arjuna’s victory over the Darada (Kashmir) and Kamboja. Kuru
and Kamboja, hence, clearly belong to the area of the Iranian satrapy
Gandara. One reason to give a proper name of such type—another ex
ample is Amorges, homavrga—to a child is that it was born in those
lands, but this hardly fits the case of the four generations of Persian
kings. Their names recall Lat. Germanicus, Britannicus etc., and were
honorific names, for participation in wars and conquests. Gandara
must have been added to the Median empire before 639 b.c.
We do not know the names the first three Hystaspids bore before
their accession; the personal name of later kings is only mentioned
where the succession was contested. But in darayavahus, xsaya.rsa, rta.
Xsa^^'a, we meet with a species of names differing in principle from all
older names of the Medes and of the elder line of the Achaemenids.
These are no mere personal names, no real compounds, but sentences
clothed in the form of a compound. These sentences are devices in the
Old Oriental manner, containing a religious-political program, reveal
ing the religion of their bearers as clearly as do the names of the
Assyrian and Babylonian kings or of the caliphs. They are “throne

names,” chosen at the accession or bestowed at the nomination to the
succession. Only these three have been created; all later members of
the house choose one of them.
At the accession, such names are ceremoniously announced, pro
claimed by heralds, as the book of Enoch says: “At the inexhaustible
fountain of justice that Son of Man was called in presence of the Lord
of Spirits, and his name before the Aged Head.” How this was done,
Tabari describes 111,1368: “Afterwards they met to choose a throne-name
for Dja‘far. Ibn al-Zayyat (the vezier) said; Let us call him al-Muntasir
billah ! and they discussed it till no difference of opinion remained. But,
the next morning, Ahmad b. abi Du’ad (the qadi al-qudat) went to him
and said: I have reflected on a throne-name which I hope will be ac
ceptable and find favor, inshallah, namely al-Mutawakkil ‘ala llah. And
the caliph ordered to seal it, and called Muhammad b. ‘Abdalmalik
(ibn al-Zayyat) and ordered him to make it known to the people. The
letters were sent out, and ran: Basmala . . . , the Commander of the
Faithful has ordered that the official name under which he will be
called on the steps of the chairs and in the letters to his judges, secre
taries, tax-collectors, chancellors and others, wherever correspondence
takes place between him and them, shall be ‘From Allah’s slave Dja‘far,
al-imam al-Mutawakkil ‘ala’llah, the Commander of the Faithful.’ There
fore, you are bound to act accordingly, and confirm reception of this
letter! With Allah’s favor, inshallah!” al-Mutawakkil bestowed their
throne-names to his three successors while they were still children.
Mutatis mutandis the same must have taken place under Darius and
Xerxes.
Thus, the problem is, what was Darius’ personal name ? Nyberg, 346,
says, according to old custom he must have borne as eldest son of Vis
taspa, the name of his grandfather, hence Arsama. One glance at any
genealogical table of an Iranian dynasty shows that this is a fallacy. A
custom is no necessity.^^ The—probably—first born son of Darius and
Artystone (Her.iii,88, vi\,6g) is called after his great-grandfather who
was either still alive or had just died. The first granddaughter, from a
daughter of the same marriage, born in 506, was called Artystone after
her grandmother, who at that time was little over thirty-three years

old. But the certainly first son of Cyrus I was not called Cahispis after
his grandfather, but Aru.ukku. And that Darius was the first son is a
mere assumption. He was not.
In the memorial list, 13,103, we find, in the group following upon
Vikaspa, before Spantadata, a Pisisyo^na, whom the legend considers as
Vistaspa’s son, later helper of the sosyant at the end of the world. An
historical Pissouthnes,^" son of Hystaspes (II) son of Darius, was satrap
of Lydia and revolted against Darius II between 422 and 414 b.c.
The name is formed with the frequent Zoroastrian term
syo^na, which in the cultural sense can signify “way of life,”
but as term.techn. “the ethic conduct ruled by vahumanah,
vahos manaho syo^nais,” to V syu- “to go,” e.g. Y.30,5 “ha^yais
syo^nais, by conduct as it should be,” Democritus’ to irparreLv a
Set, or Dar.Beh. §63: “upari rastam upariy[ayam], in the way
of right I walked.” Sometimes Vsi- “to dwell,” that means “to
live,” is used in the same sense, thus Y.39,3, “the spantan amrtan,
holy-immortals, yoi vahos a manaho syanti, who live in ewota,
or Ik too cftpovelv.”—Bailey, bsos vi,947, makes use of Y.29,3 “ya
syavate aSran rsvaho, how the lofty ‘behave’ towards the
lowly,” for interpreting MP. s 5n <*savana “way of acting” [or
< *sohn < syo^na ? ] . This is connected with MP. “sowan,
path,” model of Syr. s‘’bila, Arab, sabil in the Islamic notion
sabil Allah, equivalent to vahos manaho syo^na.
Nyberg, 163: “Vohu Manah’s Taten in Y.50,9, auch 43,2, sind
die sakralen Handlungen und Riten, die den Mysteriengesang
begleiten. Mehr: ‘That, syao^na,’ bezieht sich in den Gatha
ausnahmslos auf rituelle und magische Vorkehrungen auf dem
Mysterium oder Ordalplatz. Das gilt auch fiir das ganze
Awesta.” Fzi/.3,4ilf. says: The sin of burying men is inexpiable;
exception admitted: if the culprit embraces the mazdayasnian
religion. Reason: because the mazdayasnian religion “spayate
nars astavanahya vispa ta syo^na yacica vrzyati, wipes out all
syo^na, whatever he has committed, of the man who embraces
it, it sweeps away, so it were, every evil thought, like a high

wind blowing from the south sweeps the atmosphere clean.”
The syo^na that are wiped out are no “ritual and magical ar
rangements” but sinful acts, even inexpiable sins.
syo^na appears regularly in the frequent triad “manah vacah
syo^na, thinking, speaking, acting,” and according to that
amazing theory thinking and speaking would likewise be,
but are not limited to “mystery and ordeal places.” The “mys
tery places of the Gatha-community” correspond in that concep
tion to the “ordeal places of the Mithra-community,” whereas
the non-Zoroastrian religion of the Achaemenids would have
had “little space for ecstatic exercises on ordeal places.” This
theory would make the elder Pisisyd^na, son of Vistaspa, an
“Ordal-genosse” of Zoroaster. Vikaspa II, on the contrary,
would have given this Zoroastrian name to his son entirely
ignorant of all that and although his religion gave little room
for syo^na.
The genealogy was: Vikaspa
I. son Pisisyo^na (I) 2. son Spantadata = Darayavahus
.
I
son Vistaspa (II)
I
son Pissouthnes, Pisisyo^na (II).
Pisisyo^na I was an elder brother of Darius-Spantadata.^^ Darayavahus
is the throne-name, Spantadata, son of Vistaspa assumed at his acces
sion, and therefore, in the epopee, Spandiyat-Isfandiyar, son of Gustasp
corresponds to Darius. Ctesias heard this name, Sphendadates, in con
nection with the murder of the magus Gdmata, see under ‘Mago
phonia.’ The legend which grew around Zoroaster and Vistaspa
remembered the son of Vistaspa only as such, with the name of his
youth, under which he appears in the memorial list of Y?.i3,i03.—The
later epics make Isfandiyar achieve many heroic deeds, but do not make
him rule, and add to him two names from other sources, Dara and Vah
man, both in the role of great-kings and successors of Vistaspa. Dara,

i.e. the regular MP. NP. form of Dareyav(os), became there a son of
Isfandiyar, not at all wrong: the youth is the father of the man, and
Spantadata ruled only as DareyavoL
Vahman, on the contrary, is no personal name, but an aspect of
AhuraMazdah, Aw. vahumano, and has no historical background
whatsoever, unless one would believe Mas'udI 11,127: “They say, the
mother of Bahman, son of Isfandiyar, was a Jewess of the house of
king Saul.”
Daraya.vahu-, with the part.stem daraya-, not darayat-, is an
Old Persian formation (see etym. of zara^ustra under ‘Spi
tama’). The peculiar meaning of daraya is illustrated by the
Manichaean hymn, MirMan. 11,16,20 : “ Vm ^vd d’ryd ’vd p’yd,
and He himself holds and protects me” (before: He accom
panies me). That is the relation of xsa^radara to xsa^rapavan,
both “holder = protector,” Germ. “Landpfleger,” prefect of a
province. Cf. MirMan. 111,43: “’vmn hvfry’d’ ’vmn vxd dstd’r
bv’h, help us and hold our hand!”
The second element is vahu, not naiba, the word specific to
the OP. dialect. The throne names are devices, with a religious
meaning; therefore vahu is used, meaning the same as vahu
manah, evvoia, evvofiia. In the gathic passages collected in Wb.
1395 (below, under n°.3), the subst.neutr. vahu stands likewise
for vahu manah. In the Fravarani Y.12,4 the deva are renounced
because they are “a.vahu, an.rta, without vahumano, without
rtam.” This is the profession of faith, and just there vahumanah
is shortened to vahu. Likewise in the name of Darius’ general
in Armenia, Vahumisa, Beh. §§29-30, i.e. “*vahu(mana).misl9'a,
cui Vahu(mano) societatem (praebet),” see under ‘Myastra.’
Nyberg’s assertion, 352: “-manis steht im Westen fiir das da
nie bezeugte manah-” is doubly wrong. First, there is no word
manis, but only a second element of a few nn.ppr., the stem
of which may be manyah-, see under ‘Notarya.’ Second,
Darius attests the “Gathischen terminus manah” in saying “my
own manah, will, volition, I controlled severely.”—It does not
affect the meaning of the name, whether one is satisfied with
vahu, or regards this as a shortening of vahumanah. But it is a
shortening, because nothing else explains the double figure



THRONE-NAMES 97
D^a-Bahman, namely the n.pr. *d^aya.vahumanah dissected
into father and son7^ Nyberg, 361 : “Herzfeld’s Behauptung, der
Thronname darayavahus sei eigentlich eine Abkiirzung von
darayavahumanah, an sich eine freie Phantasie, fallt damit un
rettbar dahin.”^°—The equation Vikaspa = Vistaspa “scheiterte
rettungslos,” but the anticlimactic “unthinkable” was the rescue.
This time, the sheet-anchor is his concession of my term “Thron
namen”; by his accepting it, I win, as in a game of chess, the
position “Zoroastrian names.”
The throne-name Darayavahus was suggested by the gatha Y.31,7:
“rtam ya darayat vahistam mano, the rtam through which Ahura
Mazdah holds the vahu manah,” with the super!, vahista for vahu. We
may call the name a gatha quotation. It is a profession of faith. And
Darayavahus—pronounced dareyavos and darevos—is itself a short form
of the full name ‘darayavahumanah. ‘Aun, Ghiyath, Mu’ayyad, Nasir
al-din are all modifications only of the same thought.
The inscription on a silver jug from Hamadan^® ruled out, by the
gen. in -aha of xsaya.rsah, the former notation of the stem of this
name as ^sayarsan-, and therewith—the point that alone matters—the
etymology “stallion among the rulers.” Thus the way was opened to
find the religious-political meaning of this second throne-name. Ben
veniste accepted this at once in his Grammaire, but Nyberg, 347, still
clings to the wrong stem, a straw, though conceding “throne-names.”
“Wenn das mdglich ist,” Otto der Faule and Karl der Dicke would be
self-chosen throne-names. I had tried xsaya.rsah as formed with *rsah,
to rs; Benveniste says something similar. Tedesco wrote to me on this
problem
:
“If daraya.vahu is a shortening of *daraya‘.vahumanah-,
Xsayarsah- is perhaps shortening of ‘xsayakrsmanah, who com
mands the right will,’ cf. Aw. ‘xsayat.vaxs, who commands
speech’ and Aw. ‘rsmanah- (bahuvrihi only) right-will.’ The

The brackets in X>berg’s explanations, 245: “fsanghyo. der sich (von VohuManah) binden lasst,” and “ikois hvarna, mit hvarnah versehen hinsichtlich iki, Be^itz (\on VohuManah)” have no support at all. AltpJnschr. n‘^.19.



98 THRONE-NAMES
spelling seems to mean not ir°, but rather ’r in the anlaut of
the compound: xsaya.rsa, originally foursyllabic.—While, at the
shortening of *daraya.vahumanah- the inflexion was transferred
from manah to vahu, in the case of xsaya.rsmana-, where rs does
not allow inflexion, only the syllable -man- was ejected, but
the original ending of the word remained, ^saya- as participle
seems to have first been recognized by Foy, KZ.35,544: ‘von RV.
ksayadvira “Manner beherrschend” im sinn und der Bildung
nach wohl nicht zu trennen.’ Aw. arsan- however is not equal to
01. vira-, but only ‘man’ in the sexual connotation.”
Tedesco’s interpretation of the vowel in the joint of the composition
is proved by the Elam, transcription 'k.se.V.sa, i.e. xse.rsa; cuneif. “a”
does not mean interior long vowel, but is r son., written with preceding
aleph as if in initial position. Greek e does not result from Ion. e >
Dor. a, but from OIr. e < aya, while -aya- would give a.
rsmanah alone, Arsamenes, is the name of a son of Darius and
Phaidyme, daughter of Otanes, Her.vii,68, and of a satrap of Darius III
in the battle on the Granikos, Diodor 17,19,4. Arsamenes is to Arsames,
rsama, as Spitamenes to Spitama, and Rsama does certainly not mean
(Wb). “arsa.ama, die (sexuelle) Kraft eines Mannchens (Bar, Hengst)
besitzend.” The thought of the name xsaya.rsah < *xs^ya-tsmanah is
related to Darius’ words in NiR 8,15: “manaha hvepasyahya darsam
Xsayamna ahmi, Akk. ina muhhi libbi.ia rabaka, I commanded severely
my own will.” Akk. libbu, lit. heart, is a good translation of manah.
By choosing rs.manah instead of manah alone, the name adds a reli
gious quality, “the right will, volition.”
The two elements of the third Achaemenid name, rta and xsa^ra, are
pre-Zoroastrian words, but both notions have become aspects of Ahura
Mazdah and therewith specifically Zoroastrian. The commentary to the
very personal prayer of Zoroaster, the “rtam-vahu” in Y.20,3, interprets
the last words of this prayer as “rtai xsa^ram, to rtam (belongs, is due)
the rulership.” That is at the same time the meaning of the throne
name rta.xsa 0''a. Darmesteter called it “I’ideal de la bonne royaute.”
Thus, the three throne-names of the Achaemenids are Zoroastrian in
the narrowest and strictest sense of the word, just as the throne-names
of the caliphs, conceived in the same spirit, are strictly Islamic. As the
name of the saviour astvat.rta from Gath, astvat rtam hiyat, thus



THRONE-NAMES 99
daraya.vahumanah is derived from ya darayat vahistam mano, rta.
Xsa^'^a from rtai xsa^ram. They join the long line of apophthegmatic
names which start in the Ancient East with history and go on to the
present time, only twice interrupted under the impact of Europe: in
Hellenism and today, when one was ashamed of one’s own past and
religion.



VI. KAVI AND XSAYA©YA
“Quippe ita res humanae se habent; advorsae res etiam bonos detrectant.”

Sallust, bell.Jug. 53,8
Bartholomae, Wb. 442, distinguishes three applications of the word
kavi: (i) “Princes of tribes hostile to Zoroaster’s doctrine, adhering to
deva religion.” Therefore Lommel, Yah 171; “verstockte Fiirsten,
wegen der abschatzigen Bedeutung.” (2) “Title of the dynasty founded
by Kavata, with whom the word had coalesced with the names.” His
first example, Vistaspa, does not belong to them. (3) “Certain enemies
of the people and the faith of the Mazdayasnians.” Kavi is a title exist
ing before Zoroaster. Whether the kavi or some kavi sided with or
against him, is a mere accident. For understanding kavi, this distinction
is not worth more than saying “martiya, mortals, who were enemies of
the religion.” It is misleading—e.g. “verstockte Fiirsten”—because it
implants in the word a moral evaluation entirely foreign to it. Accord
ing to Nyberg, 48f., the kavi would have been “small tribal kings or
chiefs,” and their title “the only more generally used title of rulers in
the Younger Awesta, as unknown in the West as xsaya^ya, the western
word for ruler, in the Awesta (i.e. East).” If the words never overlap,
and since eastern conditions are an unknown quantity, this synonymity
in East and West seems to me not provable.
In the gathas three persons are called kavi: (i) kavi Vistaspa, of
the notarya. (2) Zoroaster’s “bandva” as one of the “kavitat,” see under
‘Bandva,’ Y.49,1: “the bandva, the mazista, who listened to the mis
carried verdict,” committed a sin by doing so. Zoroaster’s expression
is always argumentative, causative, the words mean “he who, being my
bandva, yet listened etc.,” thereby failing in his duty. (3) The Vehviya
in Y.51,12 (see under ‘Vehviya’): “The Vehviya, the kavian, denied
hospitium to me, the Spitama!” The sin for which Zoroaster curses him
is that he failed in his duty. Being, as a Vehviya, a kavi, he was bound
to give hospitium to a Spitama. Such duties exist between peers. The
families of the bandva, the Vehviya, the Spitama, hence are all kavi.
Zoroaster himself was a kavi. So was Vistaspa.
The yashts add one more to these applications: kavi as title of the
eight kings which the legend arranges as having ruled before Vistaspa
;
the first of them is Kavata, the last Husravah. That Husravah-Cyrus is



KAVI AND XSAYA0YA lOI
counted as a member of the foregoing dynasty disagrees with real
history, and the wrong caesura is caused by the fact that Zoroaster
appeared after his reign.
In the memorial list of kavi may be a title in the case of purus
tois kavois in 115; but in 119, kavis is a n.pr. and g(a)rsta kavois in
123 is his son.
kavi never has a local determination. Vistaspa is xsayant, not kavi
of his dahyaus ; the eight kavi are not kavi, but upamam ^sa^ram—i.e.
n.abstr. sultan—of all provinces, vispanam dahyuna’m. kavi, therefore,
is not an office bound to a place, but a rank. The adj. kavya designates
the hvarnah they own as inalienable quality and without which king
dom is not regarded as legitimate. From this adj. or from kavyana
comes NP. kaviyani dirafs, name of the standard of the empire in the
late legend.
The kavi are all members of noble houses, to each of which corre
sponds something in history: the Deiocids to the eight kavis, the
Hystaspids to the notarya; just as the older kings and Husravah precede
Vistaspa, so the Deiocids and Cyrus precede the Hystaspids. The
Vehviya are the Geopothroi, and the Spitama are Ctesias’ Spitamas.
Only one of the historical houses would not be represented among
them, the older line of the Achaemenids, unless it be by Zoroaster’s
bandva, and so it is, as we shall still see.
The facts about xsaya^ya are different. It is an adj. of the abstr. noun
Xsaya^a; the two possible forms xsaya^ya and xsayaffiya can both be
Median, but the more probable first one cannot be Old Persian. As a
historical problem, the word is Median. A special title for a satrap, and
in enlarged form for a great king, could only be created in that part
of Iran, where the empire was founded. When the Persians succeeded
the Medes, they could not do otherwise than take over, with the empire,
the style of Median chancery. No geographical question of longitude
and latitude enters into the problem. But the fact that the title is Median
shows that for the Medes there was nothing to take over, that no empire
existed before theirs.
Xsaya^ya can be used without objective determination, thus in the
introductory formula of the Darius inscriptions, or for Xerxes as prince;

a special country.” Neither the gathas nor the yashts use this official
title xsaya^ya. Zoroaster uses either the part, xsayant or the neutr.abstr.
Xsa^ram. V xsi-, just as Arab. V nalk, is “to be master, to rule over,” and
one can be malik, xsaya^ya, xsayant over one’s own house or over a
kingdom. Every king is a xsayant, but not every xsayant a king. In
the gathas xsayant is used without gen.obj. only where the context
clearly shows that it means ruling over a province. There is no differ
ence, in content or dialect, between xsaya^ya and xsayant, but the same
difference as between sayanam and xsa^ram, that between poetry and
prose: poetical language prefers to avoid official terms.
Gath, xsayant and xsa^ram always refer to a defined territory, evi
dently so in the “Gatha of the Flight,” y.46, compared with 49 and 51
Zoroaster, proscribed from his home, zam, seeks refuge with the
xsayant of another dahyu, viz. Vistaspa (st.14). Each dahyu has a
xsayant. Instead of the plur. “rulers of provinces,” Zoroaster uses the
neutr.pl. xsa^ra dahyunam; the yashts use the sg. “xsa^ram vispanam
dahyunam, ruler of all provinces” for xsaya^ya.
Only with this determination, or in “upamam xsa^ram vispanam
dahyunam, highest rulership (sultan, maiestas) of all provinces” does
the title become a sovereign one, equivalent of OP. xsaya^ya xsaya^y
anam xsaya^ya dahyunam, where equally the territorial determination
is decisive, just as even malik al-muluk without territory is not yet a
sovereign title, but that of an heir to the throne or a vezier. No more
than xsayant, xsa^ra, does xsaya^a alone signify “king.” The only
Iranian equivalent to the historical and social content which the words
king, basileus, rex imply is ahu or ahura. x^^ya^ya > sah, malka
remains the title of provincial governors and princes of the blood dur
ing the whole Sasanian period, just as both classes bear one and the
same title under the caliphs: amir from amara, syn. of xsaya^ya from
\/xsi'5 rule, to command.”
kavi means neither ruler nor king, but designates members of high
aristocratic families which rise by power and wealth above the general
level of the hvetu, as in Y.46 kavi Vistaspa above the hvetu Haugava
and Friyana. To the MMed. official formula “kavan u xsatrdffian”
corresponds MPars. “sahrdaran u vaspuhran”; this equation, in official
language, kavan = vaspuhran, is perfectly right: kavi is Taisapu^ra.



KAVI AND XSAYA0YA IO3
The oldest instance of this notion is Y/.5,33 ( = 17,35) : “0ret6na, viso
pu^ro a^wiyanois, heir of the A0wiya house.” In Eg. parchments, con
temporary with the Papyri Elephantine, specimens of the correspond
ence between the satrap and the central government,^ the satrap Rsama,
an Achaemenid, bears the title br byt’, previously known only as Pahl.
ideogr. for Ir. vaspuhr, and origin of this ideogram. Mittwoch referred
to a corresponding mar biti in an Akk. document." A sentence in Pap.
El. Sachau 1,3, Cowley 30, “God may give favor to thee before Darius
(II) and the b'^ne beta” means “before the king and his potential suc
cessors.” MP. vaspuhr is a vrddhi formation, no longer active in MP.,
hence descends from OIr. ‘vaisapu^ra, translated by bar beta in the
parchment, just as the Arabs, later, translate vaspuhr by ahl al-buyutat.
In this very meaning kavi functions, in the legend, as predicate of the
Median dynasty: they are the vaisapu^ra, Ass. en.er “vispatis,” the
mare Daiaukki of bit Daiaukki: mar biti. The Ka‘ba inscr. of Sapor I
translates br byt’ by 6 ey fiacrLkioiv, i.e. NP. sahzadah.
The legend arranges the eight kavi (including Husravah) in four
generations with only three ruling kings. That is not a legendary pat
tern, but a reflex of history. It is, moreover, a striking analogy to Herod
otus’ four generations of Median kings. Herodotus reconciled what
he had heard from Iranians—their legend—with what he had read in
Greek logographs, and therefore his presentation has evident similari
ties with the kavi legend.
None of the localities of the kavi legend is imagined to be in the
mythical home Eranvez; nor are the places the same as in the Vistaspa
cycle. These two cycles originated in different regions and at different
times. Vistaspa’s place is vis notaranam, the city Tosa notaranam in
Parthava.
Gr.Bdh.\T] mentions as one of the dynastic “Varhran” fires founded
by old “dahyupati, sovereigns”: “Uzaw e Tahmaspan [mythical pred
ecessor of the kavi dynasty] founded the a8ar k[v]’tk’n in [’h]mt’[n]
in memory of the adoption of kavat.” This is an etiologic interpretation
of the names: kavata—so to be read also in Y/.i4,2 for [kajvatahya,

which is one syllable short—is not a man’s name, but means “colt,” and
is, like “gusnasp, stallion” a shape Vrthragna assumes when appearing.^
The dynastic fire of the Medes in Agbatana was dedicated to Vrthragna
as colt, kavata. The legend takes this as name of the founder, a found
ling after the pattern of the Sargon and Moses legends, and identifies
the founder of the dynastic fire with the ktistes of the dynasty. The date
is 678 B.C.; the founder was not Herodotus’ Deiokes, Daiaukku, 715-713,
the eponym of the dynasty, who was exiled to Hamah in Syria. Cf. the
remarks to Ass. Wametiarsu under ‘Throne-names.’
Gr.Bdh.12’^: “Husravah founded the temple of Sez on mount ’ksvnd
(read: ’sgvnd) for the aSargusnasp.” Sez, Aw. cecista, is known as
name of the Urmiya Lake; the mountain is Aw. asn(g)vant in ¥^.19,5,
Ass. sangibuti < fem. asngvati, mod. Sahand, SW of Tawriz. The fire
is called “of the stallion” because it was dedicated to this incarnation
of Vrthragna.^ That it was built in gratitude for the help the fire had
given Husravah when destroying the Median uzdescar, idol-temples, is
a distortion of some historical facts. Wrong is the projection of the
Sasanian notion of Buddhist temples into high Iranian antiquity. But
Median temples had been destroyed in antiquity, by Xerxes, see under
‘Deva.’ In the legend, Husravah is always imagined as fighting in
Media, because the conquest of Media by Cyrus, his prototype, was not
forgotten: “he who counted (it) to the empire of the Aryan provinces,
aryanam dahyunam xsa^rai hankrmo” (see under ‘Mithra’).
In Yt.% mount rzifya (or arzifya.?), “eagle-mountain,” MP. ”lvf, NP.
aluh, is the place of kavi Usan. The Assyrian annals mention this widely
known mountain several times under the name arzabiia in northwest
Media; the Urartaean annals speak of “horses called arsibini, from
arzifya,” probably the Baz.qush, east of the Sahand.
Other placenames of the Husravah legend are such of race-courses:
“nava.fra^wrsa razura, nine-rounds-forest,” in Y;.5,50, “vispe.arya.
razura, all-Aryan-forest,” in Y/.i5,32, and “spetitam razuram, spetini
razura, White Forest,” in Y/. 15,31. The three forests and race-courses
are all in Media, the two latter in Lur < rzura and Shahrazur; the
former must be sought in Adharbaijan, “pasne” of the lake Cecista.
2 cf. AMI, vii,io 2 £. and iiSff. * Gr.Bdh. gives an etiologic explanation: “because the gusnasp fire set down on the bvvs y
’sp, the mane of the horse of Husravah.”



KAVI AND XSAYA@YA IO5
The Awesta ignores the legend of Spantadata-Isfandiyar, son of Vis
taspa. The Vistaspa cycle is represented in the Awesta only by Vistaspa,
and his more important brother Zarivaris with his charioteer Visatarus,
all figures of the memorial list. At the time when the quotations from
their legend were introduced into the yasht, the epic had not yet ad
mitted tales about Spantadata, and less so of his successors Dara, Bahman,
Humay etc. down to Alexander. Unless one admits the identity of the
legendary and the historical Vistaspa, of Spantadata and Darius, and
of Dara-Bahman and D^ayavahumanah, these facts are inexplicable.
The presentation of the Hystaspid period in the legend is not part and
continuation of the Vistaspa cycle, but a separate legend of still younger
origin. Nyberg, who regards the “eastern” Vistaspa as founder of a
new, otherwise unknown dynasty, remarks 289: “Kein Naotaride nach
Vistaspa fiihrt den kavi Titel,” and discusses the “Abschaffung des
kavi Titels” which he believes to have been “stigmatized” by Zoroaster
and replaced by “zoroastrissimus,” see under ‘Videvdad: Raga.’ It would
be equally true to say: no Naotarid after Vistaspa does not bear the title,
because there are none. Vistaspa is a one-man dynasty. But at least one
would expect that the title had disappeared, yet not even that is true,
kavi survives with all honors.
In Pahl. literature kavi Vistaspa remains always kai Vistasp.sah;
he has assumed beside the “eastern” kavi the “western” title sah. One
sees how near he is to the real Iranian history with their shahs. The
heroes of the really old myth, whose places are in Eranvez, hence really
in the East, become neither sah, not even after being considered as
original kings, nor is one of them, not even Rustam, ever called kavi.
MMed. kavM u xsatrdaran is as good a formula as Sasan. sahrdaran u
vaspuhran. From this MMed. “kav” the Armenians borrowed their
“kav.” In Mani’s religion, the “rosan-kav. Prince of Light” is the ruler
of the realm of light. In the Karn. Art. 11,17, Ardasir I is called “kay e
Papakan, kavi, Papak’s son,” because he descends from Sasan who is
imagined to be—without historical support—a Hystaspid, great-grand
son, or as son of his own grandfather, grandson of Vistaspa. The kings
Yazdegird II, Peroz and Kavat call themselves on their coins kay Yaz
degird etc., like many Muhammedan kings of the Middle Ages. The
seven rulers of the kisvar beyond the horizon, helpers at the resurrec
tion, are called “an haft kay.” The title did not disappear and there is



I06 KAVI AND XSAYA©YA
no trace that its value had been impaired by being stigmatized by Zoro
aster.
Mani gave it a very peculiar meaning. His “Kavan book” is the
“safar al-djababira” of the Fihrist, the “book of the giants.” Bbuni,
Chron.iQT.-. “the kayaniyya are the djababira.” That the prehistoric
heroes were giants is a Semitic conception, first expressed in Gen.6,^-.
“There were giants haggibbdrim in the earth . . . their children be
came mighty men which were of old, men of renown (better: to which
epics were sung).” Huge ruins, like the dam at the point where the
Diyala breaks through the Hamrin, or the Khosar dam near Nineveh
are called Ba Djabbara, by Syriacs and Arabs, as cairns are called
“Hiinen and Hiinengrab” in German.
One of the titles in the protocol of Xusrau I in Menander, de Legat.
11,3 is ytya? yiyavroiv, rendering Ir. kay e kayan through the medium
of Syr. gnbr’. This is the title of al-Mundhir of Hha in the Syr.
Chronicle Ndldeke-Guidi, while Tabari calls him “mahist”; he was one
of the “megistanes, Arab, nadim.” A similar thought is expressed by
the title “Rustam i Zal i zaman, the Rustam of his time,” and the last
echo is found in two inscriptions in Isfahan, of Shah ‘Abbas the Great
and of Shah Husain, where it is said “the djababirat al-djababira shall,
like the Caesars and Khaqans, for ever kiss the dust of the threshold
of the Sahinsah.”
Zoroaster has never stigmatized, or used as an invective, his own title
and that of his protector Vistaspa. The error rests on a misinterpretation
of Y.32,15:
anais a vinanasa ya karpatasca kavitasca
avais abi yan danti noit jiyatois ^snyamnan vaso
toi ‘^abiyabryante vahos a dmane manaho
“Because of these (their actions) the priesthood and the kavihood
are cursed; but even because of these (their sufferings) shall those,
whom they do not let be free masters of their lives, drive to the house of
Vahumano!”
Bartholomae: “Deshalb ist die karpan- und kavay-schaft dem
Untergang verfallen, durch die (gerade), die sie nicht nach
Gefallen fiber ihr Leben schalten lassen wollen. Die werden

Andreas: “Wegen dieses ihres Thuns ist dem Untergang ver
falien die ganze Sippschaft der Opferpriester und der kavi;
wegen jenes ihres Tuns werden andrerseits ins Haus des Guten
Sinnes gebracht werden die, von denen man sagt, dass sie nicht

Nyberg: “Darum sind die K. und K. dem Untergang ver
fallen durch die, denen sie nicht erlauben nach ihrem freien

zu Vohu Manah’s Wohnung gefiihrt werden.” Commentary,

gatha fiir die freie Verfiigung iiber die himmlische Macht, das
Befreitsein und Erhbhtsein iiber die irdischen Schranken, das
dem mit der Gottheit vereinten Seher eignet”—the text has
nothing but “as they like”—p.229: “bezieht sich, soweit ich
sehen kann . . . nur auf die gegenwartige Situation und sagt
einfach aus, dass Vohu Manah’s Wohnung in der Ekstase er
reicht, Hort und Kraftquelle der asa-Glaubigen im Kampf
gegen den neuen Kult werden solle, den die karapan und kavi
ausiiben.” Is that “einfach,” simple ?

are sinful, sinners,” and like the phrase in Y.32,12: ebyo mazda
aka mrdt, one can take it as a curse: they are lost, cursed,
“gerichtet,” as in the final words of “Faust”—anais, by reason
of the actions mentioned before. The antithesis of anais a and
avais is so obvious that not only the first, but also the latter
must be taken as adverbs. But there is no talk of actions of the
suppressed, only of their sufferings; the pron. ava, hence, does
not refer forwards to the following toi—yan, but {W
back to the preceding anais a. Andreas’ “von denen man sagt”

near to Gr. para.didomi.



I08 KAVI AND XSAYA0YA
karpatat and kavitat are abstr. nouns, but the verses aim at one kavi
and at one karpan. The karpan is determined in st.12 as “grahma, favor
ite” and is the tkesa, mobed, of Zoroaster’s bandva, brother-in-law, the
ahura mazista, in Y.49,1-2, see under ‘Bandva.’ St.ii-12 describe how
these two persecute the relatives and followers of Zoroaster, confiscate
their property, destroy their means of existence. Not because they are
a kavi and a karpan, but “anais a, because of these actions” does Zoroaster
curse them. He does not think of “stigmatizing” all kavi and karpan.
Kavi Vikaspa, and hence all kavi and karpan who join his cause are his
friends.
The etymology of karpan is obscure; the only clear fact is they were
sacrificers. V/b.s.w: “spaterhin, mit dem volligen Siege der zarathustris
chen Religion, ist die eigentliche Bedeutung von karapan als Rabbi der
daevischen ( = pre-Zoroastrian) Religion verblasst. Zur Etym. vgl. Ai.
kalpa ‘Ritus.’ For Bartholomae, the “tkesa, judges,” are likewise
rabbis. He merely chose a word with which he connected the same
sentimental value as did the late Mazdayasnians, to whom the meaning
was hidden, with karpan: something detestable. That has never been
the meaning.
In Y/.p and 13 the kavi and karpan appear among deva and martiya,
slffra. (gen.sg., = sas^ra “commander”), yatu (sorcerer) and parika, as
something abominable. In Y/.i3,i04: “vifra, inspired singer, prophet,”
in parallel with “parika, bad fairy” (properly: foreign woman,
“gypsy”), is equally misunderstood. Later, vermin like the “she-frog
bearing a thousand young ones” is added to this list, clearly revealing
its worthlessness. Something similar happened to the “keta, kayaSa,
philosophers” and others. Condemnations of the deva, the gods that
chose evil, are the beginning of such debased values of words.
The Pahl. transl. of kavyam karfnamca in these formulae is kay(k)
u karp, explained by “pa tis e yazdan karr u kor, deaf and blind in
things religious,” /cat rv^Xoi. Bailey, bsos vi,59 i, discussing this
® Duchesne’s short remark, §184; “karpan ‘qui accomplit un rite,’ Vkarp-; MP. kirfak ne garde plus trace de I'acception zoroastrienne,” can be misunderstood: kirfak “pious deed” preserves the original signification and is not affected by the deterioration, karpan has suffered
in Mazdai’sm. MP. kirfak < *krpaka passed over into Arab, as qurbah, attached to the same loot as qurban, “immolation,” and taqarruban “to come near to Allah.” But qurban is in fact Aram, qorban (Mark 11,21) and .Ass. kurbanu (with k), stem “karabu, offering.” The comparison of .Aw. karpan with OI. kalpa, therefore, is not enough; the relation to the Sem. vocables should be studied.



KAVI AND XSAYA0 YA IO9
phrase in the ]amaspnama\, remarks “the traditional translation”
might be “more than a learned comment,” as proved by the letter
attributed by Etise to Mihrnarseh:® “He who holds not the law of the
mazdesn faith, is deaf and blind, koir ( < Ir. kor) and deceived by the
Devs of Ahriman.” Yet “karr u kor” are no more than acrostics of
“kay u karp,” and have nothing in common with the old words. The
misunderstanding of kavi, like that of deva, sastar, vifra etc. by the
modern interpreters rests on a misinterpretation of Arsacid and Sasa
nian redactors and commentators who read into the gatha a disjunc
tive usage of “devic” and “ahuric” words, a thing the gatha could not
possibly contain. In the case of kavi, the first error is the assumption of
a west-east opposition, the second that of the identical signification of
kavi and ^saya^ya. Van Berchem wrote: “Des titres sont condamne a
descendre un a un les degres de la hierarchie sociale et politique.” The
etymology and function of the Pharisees has nothing to do with the
moral verdict later inherent to that title. Dutch “jonkheer” is never
an invective, German “junker” is so for millions. The ideal of one
period is the abomination of another. History brings about such trans
valuation of values. And thus, kavi and karpan, nobles and priests, be
came the “blind and deaf ones who close eyes and ears to truth.”

VII. SOCIAL STRUCTURE
The political structure of the Iranian people was built up in five steps:
nmano, vis, zantus, dahyus and above them xsa^ram.^ The chiefs of
these units were the nmanapatis, vispatis, zantupatis and dahyupatis,
all under the xsaya^ya dahyunam. The military organization runs
parallel: groups of ten, dasa^wa or handama, under a commander,
sastar, whose special title is not preserved. Groups of a hundred are
Aram, hila, a “power,” certain unit of troops, corresponding to Arm.
zaur “army,” pi. zaurk', troops, hosts; Mir .Man. equally zaur “hosts”
(not “power”) ; zavar, therefore, was the military term already in OP.

Its chief is a viraja, “centurion,” clearly expressed in the play upon the
word in yr.14,39: “noit satam janti virazo, the ‘chief of a hundred’
misses a hundred times.” His original title must have been Med. *sata
patis, OP. ‘^atapatis, because this is obviously the model for the titles
of the higher ranks and is a pre-Iranian word, correspondent to Goth.
hundafa}7s. Groups of a thousand under a hazahrapatis, rendered by
Gr. Ctesias at,apa^vrr]<;, and of ten thousand under a bevar
patis, Xenophon’s ixvpiapxos, others pvpLOTayos. Above all stands the
o-rpaTT/yo? Kal rjyepdiv (Xenophon and e.g. Curtins 4,12,8, battle of
Gaugamela), the sasta dahyaus hama^sa^ro of the Awesta, commander
in chief of the armies of the whole xsa^ram.
The backbone of this organization—as with all people of Indo-Euro
pean and Semitic language—is the vis, the patriarchal and agnatic clan.
The small family, nmana, is merely part of it, the tribe, zantu, its exten
sion. The difference is : within the vis the degree of relationship, in the
tribe only the fact of relationship is known. The vis is the inherited
fundamental unit; the units beyond the zantu, first dahyu, then xsa^ra,
are only the result of common political history.
The vis is the bearer of the political and social, as of all juridical
institutions. Military service, duties of blood revenge, law of marriage
and inheritance, bail and liability are all based on it. The vis, therefore,
is also the original scale for moral concepts, for good and evil.
It consists of the naba.nazdika, a notion shared by the Veda, an old
1 Cf. my report on Andreas’ theory in Iran.Felsreliefs, 1910, p.i6f., Anm.; Selle in review of Morgenstierne's Etymol. Vocabulary of Pashto, dlz 1928, co!.225ff.; Benveniste, Classes sociales dans la trad, avestique, J.As. xxi, 1932, iiyff.

definition of which is preserved in Vid.12, at an insignificant occasion,
namely the instructions for the duration of mourning. The center of
the naba.nazdista are the “nmanapati and nmanapa^ni, master and mis
tress of the house” as husband and wife, and the circle extends over
nine groups, to which belong
father and mother father’s brother, sister
husband-wife brother, sister son, daughter of father’s brother

son, daughter brother’s son, son’s son, daughter’s daughter of

daughter the father’s brother
grandson, granddaughter
The system is purely patriarchal, it includes neither the kinship of
the mother, nor the children of the sister: by their marriage the women
enter into the family of their husband. There is only one exception, so
striking that one must doubt its authenticity, at any rate its age: “daugh
ter’s daughter of the father’s brother.” It would be less suspicious if it
was said of the brother. If true, grandson and granddaughter would
likewise stand for children of sons and daughters. That is the relation
ship, the Arabs designate by sibt, of importance for the descendancy of
Muhammad by his only daughter Fatima. The words in 21 : “and any
body else of the toxma, family,” which indicate that not all degrees are
enumerated, belong to the redaction only and have no authority for the
original condition.^
Wb. is inaccurate in interpreting some of the degrees of rela
tionship which appear in this text, without inflection, in middle
Iranian form, or, with wrong inflection added, in pseudo
Awestic form. The original Ir. forms are *trvya, ’bratrvya,
pronounced already at the end of the 6th century b.c. turya,
braturya, with fern, in -i, not in -ya. We have:
turya, fern, turl, “father’s brother and sister,” deriv. of
pitar, as OI. pitrvya, Lat. patruus.
2 In order to characterize the intellectual level of the VidH’ddd. it must be said, that instead of the expected question “How long shall the mourning be in case of death?” it asks: “How far reaches the infection?” and makes the god answer: “as that of a dried up frog, dead more than a year!”

with souls on the Cinvat-bridge, promises and hedgehogs, but speak of
the liability of the next-of-kin, in crimes and blood-revenge. Their
source is a Corpus Juris, and they have been put in their present context
with utter lack of understanding.
The law of other peoples of IE. language offers analogies, and the
OT. equally, e.g. Exod.20,^ and 34,7: “I the Lord, thy God, am a jealous
God who visits the sin of the fathers upon the children unto the third
and fourth generation.” Similarly II Kings io,3o;i5,i2 and the revoca
tion of the idea in —The “fourth generation, ribe‘im” corre
sponds to the four generations in direct line of the Iranian schema.
Liability, claim to inheritance, etc. do not reach beyond the fourth
generation.
In Y/.io,i8, Mithra, as god of blood revenge, destroys not only the
criminal but his whole family and his property, moreover, the frata
maSata of the community. This term, used there in a threat, in y/.io,i8
in a promise, is OPersian “fratamaSata, primogenitus,” first-born, an
tonym to OP. “pasyaSata, secundogenitus” cf. (hu)pa^yazata in Ogma
deca (see under ‘Mithra’).
The four steps of social structure find an expression in the way Darius
and Xerxes present their genealogies: Xerxes son of Darius = nmana;
haxamanisiya = vis; parsa = dahyu; arya = xsa^r3 . In OP. the word
zantu is not in use, and here this third step is skipped, but it can be
inserted from Herodotus: the Pasargadai as tribus, genos (cf. under
‘Mada-Parsa’). zantu, to Vzan-, yiyvo^iai, is alone a proof that the
genetic connection is the base of the system. The various nmana with
the whole retinue of clients, bondsmen and bought slaves form the vis,
several vis the zantu. This organization is Indo-European.
The conditions are not rigid. When the master of the house, *danspot,
dies, a part of the family dissolves itself into the clan; the clans like
wise, in the progress of generations, go over into the zantu. Thus the
idea of the nation originates. As a living body, the society is in continu

ous flow. It is an old custom to call countries after their inhabitants,
because the notion of home and its extension “fatherland, patria” is
derived from descent. Thus, patriotism originates from love between
agnates, expanded to the wider unit of the nation, the xsa^ram. To this
steady transition from family into clan, clan into tribe, tribe into nation,
political history sets limits, and therewith to national spirit. This feeling
can overcome limits of dialect, but only with difficulty barriers of lan
guage; it takes momentary political conditions as something eternal
and thus creates itself frontiers. As in the smallest circle the “anya, alius,
other” is opposed to the naba.nazdista, thus the “anya, alien, enemy”
to the compatriot.
The terms for the vertical structure, nmana, vis, zantu, have always at
least three sides: they may signify the men, their place (immobile) and
their (mobile, live) property. As the inscriptions show, the names for
tribe, area and main city are identical in regions entirely settled by
Iranians. Parsa may designate Persian, Persis, and Persepolis. Vis, zantu
and vrzana may assume analogous significations. But besides there are
many specific terms: OIr. soi0ra = OI. ksetra, a general expression for
a settled area, is used in Gath, for Aw. zantu, the OP. equivalent of
which, 'Santu, is replaced by the higher unit dahyu.—^The Pahl. transl.
is rotastak NP. rusta, cultivated land, MP. apatih.—Aw. asah, related to
01. asa, designates a definite settled spot, Pahl. transl. vyak > NP.
ja(y). Vid.i uses soi^ra and asah e.g. for Raga, Marw, Herat, hence for
provinces and their capitals, at a time when the spoken language was
middle-Iranian. In Purs./\.() “a^a” appears, Pahl. transl. apatih, explained
by xvastak: “who does not give hospitality to a fugitive coming to
hv^va a^ahva, to his place.” Bartholomae translated “Hof” (or “Grund
und Boden”). The Pahl. transl. apatih means the soil a man has cul
tivated, the explanation x^astak means “which is his property,” hence
where he exercises his rights and duties of hospitium. a^a, therefore,
means “Hof, farmyard” and is an Old Persian word corresponding to
Aw. asah.—The nomenclature which extends over a long period and
a vast region is rich. The differences are those of dialect or merely of
manner of speech, but not of social structure.
y.46,1 puts the political character of the term dahyu in full light:
“Into which country, zam, shall I flee.?”; as home and habitation it is a



SOCIAL STRUCTURE 1 15
zam. It goes on: “the commanders of the province, dahyu . . —Lom
mel translates “des Landes liignerische Gebieter”—in the political
meaning it is a dahyu. This dahyu has a vrzana, an equally political
term. In the dahyu to which Zoroaster flees there was (st.5) another
Xsayans (abs., without gen.object) =xsaya 0ya, satrap. The name hvara.
zmi conveys an idea of the size of a zam: geographically a zam, polit
ically a dahyu, a large province. As early as in y^.io,i45, dahyu desig
nates, in the title vispanam dahyunam dahyupatis, the provinces of the
Median empire, see under ‘Mithra.’ Later, dahyu > deh, like other
terms and titles, fell from province to village, while dahyupati >
dehbaS retained its full value as “sovereign.”®
It is their own lands and their inhabitants that the Iranians call
“dahyu.” In OP. it has everywhere the political meaning “province of
the empire”; in the Awesta especially where it is connected with an
ethnic name. The Indians, on the contrary, designate foreign peoples
by dasyu. Wb.'jxQ-. “OI. dasyu- hat ganz abweichende Bedeutung, cf.
Geldner, Ved.Stud. 3,96.”—Since the words are the same, the original
signification must be the same, and the different moral and sentimental
value is the effect of different history. A similar case is OI. “dasa, bar
barian” as opp. to arya, but OP. daha. Aw. daha, adj. dahinam dahy
unam, is the ethnic of a certain Aryan nation, the Dahae. The words
are the same, their application differs (see ‘Daha’ under ‘Aneran
Turan’).
Hertel translates RV. vii,5-6: “Du hast die dasyu aus ihrer Wohnstatt
vertrieben, indem Du den arya ‘breites Licht erzeugst’ ” (?) and an
notates: “dasyu = dahyu = Vdlker, bezw. Lander des Persischen Reichs.”
This would imply a date after 550 b.g. and the song is certainly
much older. To RV. v,4, description of a fight with people of different
cult, he remarks, p.143: “Die Gegner sind Mazdayasnier,” which would
put the verses in the 5th century b.c.—^before which time the Iranians
were devayasnians like the Indians. When using the term “Old Ira
nian” instead, the interpretation may be right. Not even songs as old as
the Rgveda reflect conditions of the “Aryan Epoch”: if indeed they
^Nyberg, gi, translates dahyu by “Krcis,” dahyupati by “Krcishauptmann,” in order to make the conditions appear small and primitive. But “Krcise,” too, are only administrative parts of a province, a state, y.46,1 alone disproves the idea: Zoroaster does not flee from
one Kreis m another one of the same province. And dahyupati did not rise from “Kreishauptmann” to “sovereign" while dahyu made the contrary movement.

describe battles with Iranians, these would be encounters in East Iran
after the immigration of the Iranians, after 900 b.c. At that time there
were cultic differences between Indo-Aryans and Iranians, which had

in spite of identical religion and nationality—as disconnecting an
effect as political systems in our time, and as color among anthropologic
marks. Hertel emphasizes that the Vedic singers call people that wor
ship gods, hostile to their own, “raksas, yatu.dhana and druh (collect.),”
and that the Iranians use their corresponding words in the same way:
the rejection of the national gods characterizes the enemy. Only, since
both had inherited this usage from their common past, it cannot be
used for dating purposes. Though diflEcult to prove, it is possible that
some songs of the Rgveda speak of wars against Iranians, cf. vrkaz
harna : vrkadvaras under ‘Mada-Parsa.’ The opposition of dasyu and
arya in RV. vii,5-6, which has no meaning in Iranian, but only in Indian,
looks indeed like the opposition of Iranians and Indo-Aryans.
A trace of the origin of the Median title dahyupatis can be observed
in Assyrian texts. They render Ir. vispatis by (ideogr.) en.er, er, i.e.
Ass. alum, Bab. bitum, stands for Ir. vis; en is “pads, lord.” In the Assy
rian annals, en.er is the title of the chiefs of villages and towns with
their districts, Ir. ge^a. Quite a number of these en.er are surely in fact
zantupatis, e.g. Artasiri and Sepasarri of Surgadia, i.e. 'fsurgadi
Pasargadai, as chiefs of a tribe, zantu. In the Samas omina of Esar
haddon,® omen 2, Kakariti-Xsa^rita—a Deiocid as the Beh. inscription
proves—the en.er of KarKassi, a strong fortress at the place of later
Agbatana,^ and certainly a zantupatis, offers an alliance against the
Assyrians to Wametiarsu = *vahmayat.rsa, en.er of the Medes, i.e. of
the dahyu Mada. In omen 5 and 8 the coalition is joined by the Saparda,
of the Isfahan region, although the Assyrians try to prevent its expan
sion by diplomacy. In omen i and 6 Kastariti leads not only his own,
but also the armies of the Medes, i.e. of Wametiarsu, the Mannaeans
of Adharbaijan, and the Cimmerians, new immigrants. In 6, ii and 15
they besiege and take with artillery Assyrian fortresses in regions which
thereafter became Media; in 16 they attack the frontier fortresses against
Man, Adharbaijan.—^The Assyrians use uniformly en.er properly “vis

patis,” for the chief of a vis, a zantu or a dahyu. Mada is a dahyu, and
“en.er of the Mada” is in fact “dahyupatis.” The Assyrians either
ignore the facts, or did not concede to the Medes a higher title. The
royal title was given to them only by the Neo-Babylonians.®
Zoroaster replaces, in Y.31,16, the element -pati in those tides by the
abstr. noun xsadram of the dmana, soidra and dahyu, and in st. 18,
which is consciously formed after passages like y/.io,2, vis is added,
making that triad into the usual tetrad. In a similar way, in y.48,10, he
speaks, in plural, of the chiefs of the dahyu in abstract form as of the
“xsadra dahyunam, governments of the provinces.” Duchesne, §162,
discusses the relation of the IE. compounds formed with the root-noun
*pot, to the younger 01. and OIr. formations with -pati, and comes to
the conclusion that Zoroaster’s dang patis is artificially developed from
older ‘d^spat.—^The Gathic fern, dmanapa^ni is preserved in Frhg.Ev.

Therefore, a sentence like “Die im Mihr yasht zahlreichen Bildungen
mit -pati fehlen in den Gatha” (Nyberg, 81) even when right, would
not establish any local or temporal distinction, and not at all that the
Gathic dialect was in this point the more archaic, A similar error was
the attributing of a higher antiquity to the decomposed Gath. Mazda
Ahura than to OP. Auramazda, which—with one exception—is always
written as a compound. The observation would only draw the gatha
closer to the inscriptions which equally ignore the compounds with
-pati. In Yt.io, as recognized by Meillet, the language is more archaic,
and the reason is that the social conditions were more archaic than at
the time of the gatha and the inscriptions. In the very late y.2,16, once
a Gath, 'soi^rapati is decomposed into soi^rahe pati.
The four-step structure did not exist as long as the words appear in
the Awesta. Where the fourfold formula retains its genuine old mean
ing, the passages are older than the organization of the empire under
Darius. If they appear in late places, like the wergild tariff of Yt.io, the
surgeon’s tariff of Vid.y, some fragment of high antiquity has been pre
served.
The chieftainship over the fifth and highest unit is expressed in the
yashts by upamam xsa^ram vispanam dahyunam, abstr. pro concr. like
Aram, and Arab, soltan, sultan, and in yr.10,145 by the Median title
® In 640 Assurbanipa! gives Cyrus I the Dtle “sarru, king of Parsua,” as king of Ansan, a constituent part of the Elamite empire; similarly some Iranian chiefs of Saparda, El. Simas, Isfahan region, are called sarru.



Il8 SOCIAL STRUCTURE
vispanam dahyunam dahyupatis. The historical reason for the different
type of formation is obvious: there was no traditional term, like
‘xsa^rapatis,® for this highest rank, because the unit did not exist before.
When the course of history produced it, an expression had to be found,
and it was derived from the previously highest rank, by expanding it.
dahyupatis retains its original sovereign signification through all times.
It is not attested, so far, in OP. inscriptions, but in Paikuli it reappears,
1.31: aryan xsatr masik vxatavi u dehpati. In the Den\art, Luhrasp is
dahyupat as liege-lord over Nebuchadnezzar; in Art.Vir.Ndm.
dhyuptyh stands in parallel with p’txs’lyh and as late an author as
Biruni describes dahufadhiyya by a definition of the Arab concept of
the caliphate. The word was therefore unfit to serve, during the Achae
menian period, as official title of the xsayant of one dahyu only. These
received the title “xsa^rapavan, satrap,” lit. caretaker of the country,
with the rank of a xsaya^ya, a condition which explains the great
royal title xsaya^ya xsaya^yanam.
The fern, of the ground unit, “nmanapa^ni > banbisn, lady, Ma
dame,” was the title of the queens at the Sasanian period and probably
before. In the writings of Mani—who follows the Arsacid style in that
respect—visbeS < vispatis is no longer anything civil, but a divine at
tribute, and his pentad, created by adding pahragbaS “protector of the
frontiers, margrave” to the tetrad, is a purely religious concept to which
social institutions no longer correspond.
This vertical political structure is intersected by a horizontal one,
Gath, hvetus, aryama and vastrya.fsuyans, with varieties of denomina
tion, and not counting the slaves.
The fully free or noble men, born members of the tribe with all
privileges, are called “azata, OP. aSata, Lat. agnatus,” those with notori
ous degree of relationship, expressing the “agnatic” structure of the
society. Hesychios’ words: iKevOtpia irapa Hepo-at?, correspond
to the equation “azata iXevdepoi—liberi.’”“ The signification of azata
®Gath. patis xsa 9 rah>a in y.30,10, it is true, looks like and is a decomposition of *xsa 9 rapatis, but it signifies "landlord, oUoSeaironis,” not “lord of the empire” as one translates, see under ‘Hospitium.’ ^"MirMan. 11,32,18: ’c 'vy ny’g ‘y.m’n ’’z’dsy, Henning: “dutch jenen Ahn unserer Frei
heit”; 1 prefer "ancestor from whom b (inherited) our nobility."



SOCIAL STRUCTURE II9
is perfectly defined by the Roman XU tabulae: “Si adgnatus nec escit
gentiles familiam habento.”
The normal Aw. designation for this social class is hvetu, which ety
mologically belongs to *sva- “suns,” OI. svadha=e^05 “peculiar ethics,”
Goth, “sidus, Sitte, ethics,” Ittjs “friend,” eratpo?, Lat. sodalis. It has
more claim than aryaman to be translated by “sodalis” (see below). The
Greeks translate it by oiryyev^s, cognate. The demonstrable degree of
relationship inherent to the word does not reach beyond the sphere of
the vis. Highly significant is that a “specific vice” is attributed to them
in y.33,4: “taromati, over-estimating themselves,” in Y.32,3 “parimati,
conceit, hybris,” Arab, kibar and ‘asabiyya, see under ‘ArmatiL’
It would be wrong to put hvetu and the analogous terms in parallel
to the vertical structure, they belong to the horizontal. A derivation of
hvetu is “hvetuvada^a, marriage inside the vis,” especially between h alf
brothers and sisters, not “eine streng auf den Adel beschrankte Ehe”
(Nyberg), equally and more common among priests. The nobility is
called hvetu for being related to each other, the marriage, for being
contracted between relatives. The Iranians, when immigrating, super
posed themselves on an aboriginal population with matriarchal family.
Their endogamy is not only foreign to all other, strictly exogamic na
tions of IE. language, but something prohibited : alfia ifj.(f)vkiov, where
as for instance among the Arabs marriage between first cousins is the
rule. The originally patriarchal Iranian society suffered changes by
intercourse with the originally matriarchal natives of the country,
hvetuvada^a is connected with the right of inheritance. With the
Aryans, the sons of the man were the heirs; with the aborigines there
was only inheritance through the sister. The father of her children did
not enter the family of the woman—less so vice versa—but remained
in the family of his sisters.^^ Brother-and-sister marriage results from
reconciling the two opposed principles of inheritance : it enables the son
to inherit from his father as son of the father’s sister. But never do chil
dren of the same mother marry.
The Babylonians translate OP. aSata—agnatus in Beh. §3 by m^
banu, a term that replaced since the Kossaean period the older equiva
lent “mar-awelim, Aram, bar ’*nas, son of man” (Dan.7,13). The gen

eral term “man, Ir. nar” enters also for hvetu, 01. ksatnya, more often
than indicated in 1^^.1048. The correspondence between Umbr. nerf
and Lat. principes shows how old this usage is.
nar designates the group of men else called ra^eka or ra^ekar,^^
“warrior on the chariot,” an archaic word which occurs in the Y.Hafi.
perhaps because at its time, the Achaemenian period, the bit-narkabti
“chariot-fiefs” were in the hands of higher, richer hvetu, ksatriya.
Above their general level rose in wealth and power the kavi, and when
limited to them, hvetu assumes the connotation “peer, pair,” crvyyevri<i
or oiJLOTLjjLo^ in relation to the king. Mithra is more than once invoked
as ra^eka. The exact correspondent to OI. ksatriya, Ir. xsa^riya, occurs
in the yashts only as epithet of Homa, ApamNapat, and—spurious

of AhuraMazdah; in the gathas only in the comp, esa.xsa^riya, see
under ‘Hvarnah.’ But the Zoroastrian notion of xsa^ram as one of
AhuraMazdah’s aspects means sometimes collectively “xsa^riya, nobil
ity,” especially when opposed to armati as peasantry.
In spite of its rare appearance, xsa^riya had not become obso
lete at an early time, for it continues in eastern titles like ser,
sir Bamiyan etc. and in ‘Iraq and Assyria as sahrig,^® Bar Bah
lul: “shahrigh and shahrighan, Pers. sg. and pi., are aborigines,
bukhne, the most noble and important people, the most es
teemed among the owners of a place. They are the old nobility
of high rank: original dwellers of the soil.” And Mas'udI,
muriidj 11,240: “the tabaqa (stratum, rank) of the shaharidja
is above the dahaqin [pi. of dihqan]. They were constituted in
the Sawad as ashraf, nobility, by Eridj.” This remark comes
through al-Djahiz from the Pahl. gdhndma\. shahrigh is not, as
Noldeke seems to have thought, a neologism, but descends from
OIr. xsa^riya.^^
Both forms are used side by side in the very archaic hjmn to “Mithra the Warrior” in Vr.io. Arab, shihriyya, sg.fem. “thoroughbred marc” is OMed. xsaflri, cf. Hertel iiof vii, 76
and 80.—At the two places where Wb. assumes the connotation “human female,” Y. 6 ^,^ and W(/.i 8,32, it means certainly “marc,” and therewith “arsan, stallion.”
1* Bar Bahlul, cf. G. Hoffmann, Syr.A\t. 239.—^The old interpretation of SaintMartin, d5ei7aj<es, var. hei-yaves in Polybius 5,54 = dehigan, was right, against criticism raised. This class of officials in Seleucia was recruited from the same class as the chiefs of tassudj in Sasanian times. At the Arab conquest w'e find many of them; tassudj is a “quarter” of an astan, subdivision of ‘Iraq.

SOCIAL STRUCTORE I2I
The relationship inside the vis is expressed by the frequent word sar,
which sometimes forms a pair with “hozantu, cognate,” and “haxman,
Lehnsgefolgschaft, duty of a vassal to follow his lord (in war).” Y.49,3:
“yearning for the sar with Vahumano,” see under ‘Ya-ahi!’ In Y.32,2
AhuraMazdah is “saramno, living in sar with Vahumano,” and “hus
ha^a with Rtam,” which is more than “well-befriended.” sar means
connubium, in Y.53,3 downright “marriage,” and is best translated by
“wedding.” The prohibition of sar and haxman in Y.49,9 and 53 (see
below), if the words have their intense meaning, would be a deeply
interfering order, but one for which there is certain historical support.
Y.49,9: noit rsvaca saram didans drugvata
“who as a right-speaking one refuses the sar with a drugvant.”
Y.49,3: antar vispan drugvato haxman mruve
“I interdict all haxman with the drugvant.”
Such verses produced the passage in the Fravarani Y.12,4 and 6: “I
renounce, antar mruve, every sar with the deva and drugvant, even as
Zoroaster renounced the sar with the deva, devais saram vyamruvita.”
It is a kind of divorce formula, like “vizaya^a magam tarn, if you sepa
rate this marriage. . . .” Nyberg remarks to Y.31,21: “sar ist die
Bezeichnung der Gatha fiir die unio mystica.” Nietzsche once speaks of
“unio mystica et physica,” and these things lie close together. When dis
carding certain sides of medieval mysticism, one may see in sar, applied
to the relation of AhuraMazdah to his partial figures, or aspects, a unio
mystica. Else, it is an anachronism to transfer to that old period and
milieu medieval Sufi concepts of the relation of man to god. And in
any case, if sar could assume such a metaphoric connotation, it must
first have had the corresponding social meaning.
In the relation between AhuraMazdah and his partial figures Zoro
aster sanctifies human relations, social and of kinship. In doing so, he
degrees, which go differently dressed.” Titles and designations of rank are difficult to separate. Theophylact Simoc. 1,9,6 says of the kardarigan: “it is a title, for the Persians love to call themselves by their tide only.” So it was to the present day. But the Arabs speak of dahaqin because the chiefs of the tassudj belonged to this class of nobility. Firdausi describes the dihgan as the people who transmitted the epics: the minstrels had always sung them at their courts, and for their benefit the old myth was transformed into a poem of courtly knights during the Arsacid period. The form is regular: MP. dehigan >• Ar. dihqan, like rozig > rizq, garamlg >
djarmaq, hromigan > rumaqan; the meaning: "gentry, provincial nobility.” Not OIr. *dahyauka, short form of a comp, with dahyu, but a MP. formation of deh -|- ik, formed' after the model of sahrig.

transfers something that belonged to Mithra to his AhuraMazdah. One
aspect of his god of many faces, xsa^ram, symbolizes the knighthood
as such he is later Shahrevar; armatis is the peasantry; and the bonds
of kinship and society, the rvatis and mi^ra, upon which this society
rests, are reflected in the relations between those aspects.
Membership of the tribe, zantu, is expressed, in Gath, and Aw., by
huzantu. Its hu- is *sm-, not *su- Gr. v-, as in huyayna = "hoyaxna, “from
the same liver, consanguine,” hence “hozantu, of the same zantu, de
scent, crvyyei/179,” a born member of the tribe, the fully entitled civis
of the civitas, hozan^wa.^"* The three gatha passages in which the word
occurs become at once full of meaning. Y.49,5 promises ambrosial food
to those who live in sar with Vahumano and are hozantu of ArmatiL
The notion “belonging to the family of Armatis” corresponds to Mani’s
term “naf” for his community, y.43,3: ^wavans hozantus spanto, Bar
tholomae; “zuverlassig, wie Du, wissend” is “congenial to Thy High
ness, holy”; and Y.46,5 (see under ‘Hospitium’ and ‘Mithra’): “Who
as xsayant, satrap, or hozantu, civis, welcomes the ayantam, new
comer,” according to 46,1 Zoroaster as refugee.
In opposition to the born members, hvetu, the aryaman belong to the
tribe without being agnates. Ved. aryaman is “socius, fellow”; NP.
erman is “guest”; Sarm. Leimanos, Osset, liman “friend, socius.” There
is no reason to deviate, in Iranian, from this everywhere attested mean
ing, e.g. Bartholomae: “Sodalen, Genosse and zwar priesterlicher Ange
horigcr des ersten oder Priesterstandes ; iiber die Bedeutung ist den
gathischen Texten nichts zu entnehmen.” Nyberg: “Priesterstand, und
dieser als kollektive Gottheit.” Andreas-Wackernagel on the contrary:
“stammesverwandt,” which would be hvetu. Only Hertel has the right
word “Schutzgenossen.” The aryaman are the Gr. metoikoi, metics,

Rom. clientes, all who partake of the rights of the tribe into which
they are admitted without being born to it.
The old oath by which an aryaman was admitted into the vis is
preserved in the so-called “Fravarani,” where it is interpreted anew as
the vow with which a neophyte embraces the Zoroastrian religion. But
it is so little transformed that it remains unfit for a credo, and that the
original is easily abstracted from it. Lommel’s remarks on ¥.46,6 are
right in spite of wrong translation: “Die Aufnahme eines Bekehrten
[in reality of a xenos] soli—scheint’s—in den Rechtsformen der Auf
nahme eines Schutzgenossen vollzogen werden” (cf. under ‘Hos
pitium’). Like the hvetu, the clients do not belong to one of the four
degrees nmana etc., but intersect them.
Wherever, with people of IE. or Sem. language, the patriarchal clan,
limited by agnatism, is the original social and juridical unit, we find
similar conditions. With the Arabs, the ‘ashira represents the vis, under
a mukhtar, the vispati; several ‘asha’ir form the ta’ifa under a shaikh,
the zantupati; the agnatic members of the tribe are hurr = azata, and
are called nafar = nar; also walad bait = vaspuhr. The old expression for
foreign members of the clan is maula= aryaman: they are metics which
exist in every tribe. Ibn Khaldun, Proleg. 1,284, quotes a hadith relating
to the maula notion in connection with the case of the Barmacids,
clients of the ‘Abbasids: “Le client d’une famille est un membre de cette
famille qu’il soit client par afiranchissement, ou par adoption, ou par
un engagement solennel; ce droit lui appartient.”^®
aryaman in itself designates nothing priestly, but it includes the magi
and priests as the most important metoikoi of the vis and the zantu.
In later times, the simple magus goes out of use and mobaS <*magu
pati replaces it, i.e. the qadi; at the same time mobaSan m6ba8 replaces
’magupati, which is no new formation of MP. The Elam, cuneiform
tablets of Persepolis teach that the magi, like the Muhammedan qadi,
had the juridical and financial administration in their hands. If the
word magu—save the hapax magu.tbis which at any rate proves the
existence—is missing in the Awesta, it is not because the magi were

and e^rapati. Vistaspa, who founded fire-temples, has his e^rapati,
fire-priest, in the person of Man^ravaka; Zoroaster’s bandva, as an
ahura, one who has the right of judicature, has his tkesa “judge” about
him. Those are magi. Krsaspa had a brother Rvaxsaya, who was also
tkesa and moreover dataraza, judge and legislator (see under ‘Wel
come’). All these were and always remained magi: judges, adminis
trators of finance, priests. In all their functions the Greeks call them
magoi, as superficially as Europeans call all Muhammedan preachers,
judges and scholars “Mulla.”
In the Videvdad, Aryaman appears as god and healer, not because
the aryaman were physicians and medicine one of the accomplishments
of the priestly class, but because priests and physicians—many of them
foreigners—were clients. Thus the misconception of the aryaman en
tails that of the magi.
Herodotus i,ioi calls the magi a “tribe, genos,” in a passage inserted
into the Deiokes legend, which begins and ends with ecm 8e MtjSwv
rocrdSe yevca. Apparently this phrase belonged to his source, perhaps
Hecataeus. Comparison with 1,125, on the “tribes of the Persians” and
an analysis of the names—see under ‘Mada-Parsa’—reveals that both
paragraphs are not Herodotus’ own research, but reports of different
origin, with even dialectic differences. Herodotus grasped the real
Iranian tribal constitution no more than any other Greek, and his
authority is not enough to accept the magi as a “tribe.”
Nyberg, who does accept this, says, 336 : “Uber die Magier sind schon
Strdme von Tinte vergossen . . . , ihr Problem kann wirklich etwas
klarer dargestellt werden, als bisher. Jede Behandlung muss von der
deutlichen Tatsache ausgehen, dass die Magier ein Glied der Standes
organisation”—hence no tribe—^“des medischen Reichs ausmachten : die
Priester^ffi^e.” As a clear fact it would be no problem, and every
investigation not starting from aryaman only increases the “stream of
ink.” The phrase on p.374, “die eigentliche Priester^ar/e des medischen
Reichs bildete einen Stamm oder Priesterrtoaz in Raga,” is not a “wirk
lich klarere Darstellung,” but the perfect picture of prevailing con
fusion: whether they were a tribe, class or state is the problem; “castes”
developed only in India, not in Iran.
The magi as phenomenon resemble the Levites. IV Mos. 1,48, 11,32 (cf.
26): “Thou shalt not count the tribe Levi,” and thus one shall not



SOCIAL STRUCTURE 125
count the magi among the Iranian tribes. IV Mos. 25!!.: “The Levites
dwell in 48 cities,” and thus the magi dwell in all cities and countries
of Iran. IV Mos. 26: “For to them no heritage was given among the
children of Israel,” and thus the magi did not own Raga ^rizantus
zara^ustris, the capital of three zantu, genea, which belonged to Zoro
aster.
But without being a “tribe” in the genetic meaning, the magi were
regarded as a “trihe” in the political meaning. In a society founded
upon clans and tribes and becoming more complex in course of time,
fictitious tribes originate. While the genuine tribes own their land, these
have “no heritage,” but are dispersed over the entire state. The abstract
dena of Zoroaster, the religion, is a similar case; politically it is regarded
as a vrzanam, community = township (see below).
In Y.Haft. 40,3-4 haxman replaces aryanam, a correct usage, for it
does not signify “Zusammenschluss, Priesterkollegium,” but “Gefolg
schaft, followership” of clients, metics. Vhak- is Lat. sequi, hence “suit.”
Pahl. transl. regularly “hambratih, brothership, comradeship.” As a
verb V hak- is used in two closely related meanings: “to follow = obey”
and “to belong = be owned,” cf. Germ, horig, gehoren, gehorchen. The
whole Yz.iy is full of the picture of Rtis who “hacati, follows, belongs”
to those she blesses “in long, voluntary marriage, sar.” In Y.32,1 she is
called hvo.awi.sak. Wb. translates “sich gerne zuwendend, gern bereit
stehend,” but it is “hva-, avro plus awi.sak = Gr. icf>i7rea-6ai, *avTo -f
inLo-TTOfievr}, in voluntary service,” cf. hva.ista under ‘Hvarnah.’ The
term haxman describes several social relations of similar kind: that of
the “clients, socii” to the tribe; that of the “hostes, guests of the tribe”
to the hospes ; probably also that of the half-free peasant and shepherd,
vastrya.fsuyant, to the full freeman.
Therewith it comes near to the notions bondage, “Hdrigkeit,” and
“villainage, Leibeigenschaft” ; it is the term for half-freedom or half
bondage, missing in modern languages; cf. armatishak, rta.hak, rtishak,
Mithroaxes, where hak- has the meaning of Akk. awel or arad, Arab,
‘abd before divine names, type ‘Abdallah, Allah’s slave, haxman can
also mean the military service of the auxiliarii, thus clearly in Y/.i3,30,
where the Fravarti who are coming (in 49) from their vis, visaSa, to
the hamaspa^medaya, the muster of the army, are called “hushaxmano,
the best auxiliaries.” Xenophon calls such auxiliaries, namely the fol

sak; they resemble the Arab “mutawwi'a, volunteers.”
Sometimes Vrap- and rafnah are used as syn. of \^hak-, haxman,
e.g. Y.Haft.ip,y. ahma.rafnah beside adyus and haxman, “loyal to our
service.”^^ Hertel, iiqf \m,ii6, asked “besondere militarische Truppe.?”.
Vrap- is the stem more common to OP., “raftan, to follow,” later for
syu- “to go,” when this became “to become.’”®
In view of the multitude of terms, there were surely several degrees
of freedom, as in Babylonia, but they cannot be defined.
The slaves, OP. bandaka and marika. Aw. vesa, and the female slaves,
Jahika, play no role in the gatha; that they existed is obvious.
The terms for the peasantry are “vastrya, man of the pasture,” espe
cially of large cattle; fsuyant, originally breeder of sheep and goats,
resembling Lat. barbicarius > berger. The compound vastrya.fsuyant
is “cattle-breeder.” The words are old and have developed to “owner
of pastures” and “peasant, farmer” with the change of cultural con
ditions, as the notions civis, gens shifted in Roman history. Zoroaster’s
role as patron, mantus, of the peasantry—a subject treated under ‘Ar
matis’—is reflected in his being figured as the first vastrya.fsuyant, a
concept attested by the Platonist Hermodoros (in Diogenes Laert.,
Prooem.i) who speaks of Astrampsychos, recognized by Markwart as
OP. *vastrya.fsu.ka. Under the Sasanians, the peasantry, like all classes,
had an official chief, the vasrosansalar.^® In later legend he became a
dishonest vezier Rastravis, i.e. vastriyos, of Vistasp or of Bahram Gor,
e.g. in the Siyasatnamah of Nizam al-mulk and in ‘Aufi’s Djawami*.
In the gathas, the cow-breeders are called godayah, to Vda(y),
OdoiiaL, meaning “alere, then colere,” whence NP. Kurd, “da, daya,
wet-nurse,” hence like Am. “cow-nurse.” In Y.29,2, godayo ^waxso,
with 0wax^ MP. tuxsidan, NP. zahmat kasidan, hence the “hard
working cowboys.” The expression is abstract, “labor” for “laborer.”

vastryo?” And, referring to sheep instead of cows. Aw. vidat.fsu and
fradat.fsu, names of the two krsvars, see under ‘Krsvar.’
The peasantry lives in half-bondage, in Akk. terminology “harran
sarri.” Geiger had painted, in his Ostiran. Kultur, an idealistic-romantic
picture of a “Schweizer Aim,” and Nyberg keeps to it, p.276: “Die
alte Hirtenideologie ist natiirlich voll lebendig [at the time of the
Y.Haft.\, sie ist als festes Grundelement im [post-Zoroastrian] Zoroas
trismus enthalten.” The truth came nearer to the magnificent Bakhti
yari-film “Grass.”
A passage in the Nirangistan, ed. Sanjana, Pref.^, discussed by Bar
tholomae Wb. s.v. vi.ma(y)-, gives insight into the life of these poor
people, of whom Zoroaster took charge. It is badly transmitted and
can be understood only by comparing it with a passage in Djuwaini
1,22, 141?.,'° who describes the “bigar i nafsi, bounden service of peas
ants,” as an institution of Djingiz Khan. The institution is much
older; the “leiturgies” of the early Muhammedan epoch are the same
thing. Sentences like “if the man is not at home, his wife goes out in
person and does the work” conform literally to the Nirang. “when both
take care of the farmyard, ge^a, each of them shall go out; (if) the wife
(takes care of) the farm, the man shall go out” etc."^ There one has a
glimpse of the life of a boundsman.
MP. byk’l > bigar, is known to me from one passage in the

believed it to be an Iranian word. It is Akk. ilku, corvee, in Beh.
alluka, Pap.El. ’Ivk, Aram, hlk (Ezra), which passed from
Aramaic into MP. as hlg, TPars. x^g? and thence into Arab, as
“kharad] taxes,” see AltpAnschr. sub “manda.” Beside hlg v
byg’r the pair hlg v b’l often appears, with “bar = (^dpo5, Akk.

k’hyt, taxes and tributes are to be taken off of the poor classes,

exertion.
Bartholomae, Wb. s.v. pistra, says: “Stand oder Kaste; es giebt drei,
nur in y.19,17 vier Stiinde: a^ravan ‘Priester,’ ra^esta ‘Krieger,’ vas
trya.fsuyant ‘Bauern,’ huti ‘Handwerker.’ Im Gathischen z.T. abwei
chend; Aryaman oder viell. [means YIlaft.\ haxman fiir den Priester,
Xvaetu und nar fiir die Krieger, vastriya.fsuyant oder koll. vrzana,
vrzanya fiir den Bauernstand.” Nyberg follows with vrzanam as “tiers
etat,” aryaman as “priest,” adding “im Y.Haft. scheint vrzana zunachst
Kultverband zu sein,” no reasons.—pistra is no more than “profession,”
Arab, asnaf al-nas, not “Kaste, caste.” “Bauernschaft” was a wrong trans
lation introduced by Pischel-Geldner, VedStttd. 11,19. None of the
Gath, terms enumerated means “priests,” nor are they the “first class.”
The Gath, and Aw. terms are no opposed systems of three or four
classes at all.
The error entails a wrong analysis of vrzana in 1^^.1424^, in “a)
‘Gemeinschaft,’ b) politisch ‘civitas,’ bezw. Ap. ‘Stadt,’ c) im Gegensatz
zu Adel und Priesterstand der ‘Dritte Stand.’ ”—vrzanam is nowhere
the term for a “class, etat. Stand” as opposed to others; nowhere does
it signify anything but “oppidum, civitas.” The different vocalization
~-h is tempting to connect with it the title IPahl. ’rkpty or hrkpty, IPars. hlgvpt, Aram, 'rgbt', usually translated “lord of the ‘arx,’ castle,” and to translate “chief collector of taxes.” But in Palmyra the dpyairerTjs is the commander of the horse and dromedary corps, cf. F. Cumont, FouiUes de Dura p.xli,n.5, and Dittenberger, SylL, Or.inscr. 645 with <ppovpapxot = argapan.



SOCIAL STRUCTURE 129
in Gath., Aw. and OP. is for us without importance. Ved. vrjanam is
“village, oppidum,” cf. Hertel, iiqf, vii,ioi. In RV. the vrjana have a
“raj, king.”
In the OP. inscriptions vrSana designates the capitals of the dahyu
in the sense of Aw. zantu, hence civitas > citta. Where tribes and their
country do not bear the same name, the name of the vrSana serves for
purposes of administration. For the capitals of the great dahyu, e.g.
Agbatana and Persepolis, special terms are used, like “di8a, acropolis”
or “vi0, residence of the king.” Likewise, in the Awesta, the residence
of Vistaspa is called vis of the Notarya, the city of Tos.
In the gathas, the meaning is the same. In Y.33,5, Zoroaster “prays
away,” removes by his prayer the nazdistam drujam, the disadvantage
that Dru^s is the closest neighbor, from the vrzanam, Pahl. transl.
“hamsayakih, life under the same shade,” clearly life in a “town” (see
under ‘ArmatiF). In Y.46,1 the vrzana is the place of the tribunal,
hence a “mMina, place of tribunal,” ideogr. for MP. sahristan, “cap
ital.”"^ In Y.33,3 and 4, vrzana appears at the side of vidans ^wa^saha
gavoi, hence is certainly not the peasantry. Nyberg’s notion, 48, of a
tribe of cattle-breeders “die offenbar sesshaft sind” contains for Iran
and Turan a contradiction in adjecto: they are nomads by definition,
and must at least change between summer and winter pasture, garmsir
and sardsir, qyslaq and yailaq.
Like all analogous terms, vrzana can signify the place and collectively
the men in it; for individuals the adj. vrzanya, “citizen” is used. There
is a dark passage in Y.45,9:
mazda xsa^ra vrzny’(v) or \tizyn’(v) dyat ahuro pasus

AhuraMazdah with instr. “in his quality of xsa^ram” is so
common an expression of Zoroaster that other interpretations are im
probable. The bad transmission of the text does not permit a decision
between varzi na or vrzanya. “help to activity” is not very convincing,
and “give us vrzanya” would only require an emendation of the case
termination, meaning: “give us members of the vrzana, of our com
munity.”
In the “Gatha of the Flight,” Y.46,1 (text under ‘Hospitium’) a
badly preserved vrzana hoca (vv.ll. ha ca, haeca) stands in parallel with
sastaro dahyaus “the commanders of the province,” Andreas-Lommel
refrain from translating. Bartholomae puts down a special fern, form
vrzana. The long a, however, is but the usual notation in Gath, com
pounds, cf. Duchesne, Comp.av. §i7,d; the faulty separation of the
compound caused the assimilation of the rel. ya, instead of yo. The
stanza speaks of the tribunal which exiled the prophet from his home
town. The corrupt second element which begins with h and ends in -a
must express in relation to vrzana, the town, what the sastaro are in
relation to dahyu, the province. Two letters must be corrected. That
can be nothing but hartar, nom. harta, which appears in y/.io,8o beside
me^anahya pads and vrzanahya pads, in the shape nisharta adrujam,
in form and sense a counterpart to sastar. Mithra is—Y/.io,io3—the har
tar and awyaxstar of all ge^a, the goods and chattels of all the vis, the
world, its “custodian and guardian,” a metaphor which presupposes
the existence of the corresponding post in the vrzanam, that is of the
‘vrzana.harta. Ach. xs^^'^a-P^'’3n is another perfect counterpart.^^ The
court of the vrzanam—m'dlna—sahristan was under the authority of
an ahura, lord justiciary, presided over by a tkesa, judge, and the jury
consisted of “hvetu, free cives”; aryaman, clients; the sastaro dahyaus,
military commanders of the province; and the “vrzana.hartar, consul
civitatis,” seemingly a member ex officio.
In the Ka'ba in^cr. the satrap arc all chiefs of towns, a change Hiibschmann noticed also m Armenian; satrap deteriorated into “ma>or” when sah replaced the title.



SOCIAL STRUCTURE I3I
To this banishment from his home town, Zoroaster refers also in
Y.49,7:
ko aryama ko hvetus datais ahat
yo vrzanai vahviyam dat frasastim
“Who is the client, who the nobleman, who, through data, for the
vrzanam will obtain the good proclamation?” (See under ‘Haugava.’)
The frasastis by data, royal edicts, is an official proclamation by heralds;
what Zoroaster hoped for is the rescission of the verdict of the court of
his home town. If he was banished for the sake of his doctrine, the
frasasti would be at the same time the official recognition of the doc
trine. Thus, the dative vrzanai can, in principle, mean two things: (i)
simply “town,” and then refer either to the home town, the proclama
tion being ordered “for the town,” to take place where the verdict was
passed; or for the town where the prophet had found asylum. (2) vrza
nam can refer to the doctrine itself. The normal term would be “dena,
religion” as community of the adherents, defined by Nyberg as “Kollek
tivausdruck fiir die Schauseelen der Anhanger.” For the government,
not interested in “Schauseelen,” a group of cives would be a civitas, not
in the topic sense, but a fictitious vrzanam, as the magi are a fictitious
tribe, zantus, without land.
Among the members of the court were the “sastaro dahyauL” The
plural shows that a province—which had only one ^[(sayant, el? Kotpavo^
ecTTCj—had many sastaro, and Y/.io,i4 shows that there were sastaro in
all provinces of arya.sayanam. Sastar, from Vsanh-, OP. 9ah- “to com
mand,” means “commander,” like amir from amara. In Y/.io,4 they
dress the ranks of the “ira, columns, regiments”; in 10,109 the highest
sastar hamaxsa^ro to whom Mithra grants this xsa^ram puruspaSam
hvanisaxtam has absolute authority to punish, power over life and
death, and his verdict is at once executed. In Y/.i4,i3, the male camel
stands there, “vidiSiva ya^a sasta, looking up and down like a sastar”
in front of his troops, that means quite humorously “like a commanding
general,” while in Y/.i4,47 Vrthragna “virazati, dresses the ranks, antar
rasta rasmana, of the two phalanges,” like a viraz, viraja (Y/. 14,37), ^
captain. An assertion “sastar, only used for enemies of Zoroaster” (Ny
berg, 91) sounds strange in view of such material.



132 SOCIAL STRUCTURE
The sastaro are the military officers of the province, as the name
says: one commands soldiers, sastar has nowhere a relation to a special
territory. Nyberg, 57: “Wir horen auch von Herrschern iiber grdssere
Gebiete [than the dahyu], die also hdher stehen, als der dahyupati, der
Landesherr. Diese hoheren Gebieter fiihren den Namen sastar,” and
p.304 “vielleicht eine ostiranische Entsprechung zu achaem. xsaya^ya
Xsaya^yanam.” The “greater areas” are the words sayana and siti,
abstr. nouns, “the dwelling, living” of man and animal in any optional
region. Dahyupati is sovereign, nobody can be more than sovereign.
The plurality of the sastaro of the dahyu are subordinate to the dahyu
pati and to the one x^ayant of every single dahyu. The gen.pl.
sas^ranam, OP. *^as 0''anam,
*0asanamis the origin of Sasan, personified
as son of Humay and her father Bahman-Ardasir, grandson of Vistaspa.
He is the ancestor of the Sasanakan, and the name of the dynasty is the
old title. The Arsacid Spahpat of Khurasan, too, bear a title as family
name, sastar was certainly not East Iranian.
This does away, at the same lime, with all “devic” interpretations of
the word, and it has no “Bedeutung” at all that “a satar [only once
gen.sg. sa^rascit and twice gen.pl. sa^ram“^] in der zoroastrischen
Gemeinde [i.e. in bad verses of the Arsacid period] formelhaft den kavi,
karpan, Zauberern und Hexen [one may add: female frogs] gleich
geordnet wird, mit denen Zarathustra zu kampfen hatte.” Bartholomae
assumed that another word sastar, belonging to sadra and was
responsible for this application, but the misunderstanding is foreshad
owed by verses like Y.46,1 (for sastar) and 48,10 (for karpan), and no
more reason is needed. The Gothic “hundafa[7s, centurion,” correspond
ent to the prototype of all Iranian sastaro, the 'satapatis, became Germ.
Hundsfott, i.e. “scoundrel, rogue.”
25 See ‘Memor. Doc.,’ footnote 15 .



VIII. HOSPITIUM
“Allahumma, ana daifuka wa naziluka!”

‘All al-HarawI
Bartholomae analyzes the frequent to mastership
over, imperium, regnum as (i) “Herrschgewalt, nicht immer auseinan
derzuhalten von (2) Herrschgehiet, dies besonders als Aufenthalt der
Seligen, Gotter; (3) personifiziert als Amrta Spanta.” In OP. the mean
ing is everywhere clearly imperium, (i) as governed country, thus used
for Iran, Babylon; (2) as government.
Another one is the concrete use of the abstract. In the Aw. title
upamam xsa^ram vispanam dahyunam the abstr. stands for
Xsayant, xsaya^ya; equally in the gathas, very clearly in Y.48,10:
“dusxsa^ra (n.pl.) dahyunam, the evil satraps of the provinces,” and
in Y.48,5; 49,11: huxsa^ra—dusxsa^ra. In Y/.io,io9,iii, xs^^ram
serves, with the adj. puruspaSa, hvanisaxta, especially for military com
mand. As collective it can designate the class of the xsa^riya; this par
ticularly where it is the amrta spanta, aspect of AhuraMazdah, later
called xsa^ram varyam > Shahrevar, and pictured as a warrior.
But even after this extension, there still remain passages where none
of these significations fits. Bartholomae calls Y/.5,87 “undeutlich”:
0 wam caratis zizanatls
jaSiyante huzamiyam
^wam kanino vaSre yona
Xsa^ra hvapa jaSiyante tahmamca nmanapatim

Besitztum,” note: “worth ‘Herrschaft,’ hier anscheinend im
Sinn von Reichtum.”
hv.apah and hv.apah—the script is incapable of distinguish
ing the quantity of the vowel—can correspond to Lat. opus or
aqua, and must be separated accordingly. Referring to maidens
wanting to marry, it means certainly, like NP. cihr, gohr, ab.

the noble descent, beauty, not needlework. Their desire is, as in
Y/. 15,39 below), to have children from their husbands, and
the easiest solution would be to read ci^ram for as in
Yr.15,130.^ Otherwise, ^sa^ra ought to mean here “house, house
hold, being mistress of a house.”
Furthermore, all passages with masa.xsa^ra, magahya x^a^ra, pads
Xsa^rahya and the comp, manza.xsa^ra and xsa^rakrta are subject to
doubts.
Y.33,5 (commentary under ‘Post and Travels’):

rtat a rzus pa^o yesu mazda ahuro seti
“I who will call forth Thy most-high srosa at the relay, arriving at the
everlasting xsa^ram of Vahumano, at the straight roads where Ahura
Mazdah dwells as Rtam.”
“Empire” is possible, but does not fit into the vivid image of the
journey through life and heaven; xsa^ram evidently resumes “avahana,
relay-stage” and must be a synonym: “Inn to the Eternal Life” would
fit into the image.

wohnt?” Note: “yaus da ‘in Lauterkeit weihen’ ist ein Notbe
helf; ‘vollkommen machen’ (Bartholomae und ^nlich An
dreas) scheint mir nicht zutreffend zu sein.”
yoz-da, cf. “iusiurandum, oath of purgation,” encompasses
“to make whole, to heal, to hallow, also to repair, to purify.”
Without straining the meaning one could translate “to reform.”
The gramm. construction puts dena, the regens of the rel. clause,
into this clause with case changed. The transition from third
person into vocative is typical for many gathic verses.
The end is the easiest to understand: “Your Highness, who dwellest
as Vahumano and Rtam in the same house.” That is not a statement
that the god shares a house with his inseparable aspects, but that those
to whom it is promised, asisti, shall dwell in the same house, hadmoi,
with the trinity Mazdah-Rtam-Vahumano. Similarly in Y.46,14 (under
‘Myastra’): “Those whom Thou, Mazdah, wilt receive [at the ban
quet] in the same house [with Thee], I shall call out with words of
good-will, vahumanah.”
For asisti cf. Y.30,10 (text under ‘Myastra’) : “Then, her vault shall
be shattered for the Druxs, but those that are deemed worthy because
of (their) good renown, shall partake in the fair abodes, husiti, of
Vahumano, Ahura and Rtam.” The promise of such a dwelling is a
contract with the owner of the house, called “patis xsa^rahya, landlord”
in the preceding line oiKoSea-non)^ of the NT.—for a share in the
house in which His Highness, ^wavans, dwells himself. There is no
reason to give rsva in “the promised rsva x^a^ra,” as Wb. does, any
other than the usual meaning “high,” Ved. rsva, Gr. 6p66 <}. They may
be high like the “New Jerusalem, celestial abode, the high-built city,”

cf. “manyustata, built into heaven”—or as a “feast, MGerm. hoch
geziten,” or because the “High one” grants them—cf. srosa called vispa.
mazista as His servant.
The plural xsa^ra forbids to see in the sg. xsa^ram the “kingdom of
heaven.” The image is that of an abode in paradise. At our place, 44,9
see under ‘Welcome’—the verses are preceded by “Shall my soul be
greeted with ‘Be welcome’.?”, the welcome in paradise.



136 HOSPmUM
y.32,12, text under ‘Welcome!’ c£. the similar stanza 32,15 under
‘Kavi’:
“Because by their [epic] songs they do harm to the really good con
duct of men, AhuraMazdah curses them who destroy the livelihood of
the cattle-breeder, gaus |yotum, with acclamations.” Then:
12; yais grahma rtat varta karpa xsa^ramca isnam drujam
13 : ya ^sa^ra grahmo hisast acistahya dmane manaho^
“(AhuraMazdah curses those) by whom the karpan as favorite and
the xsa^ram of those bent on dru^s are preferred to Rtam, at which
Xsa^ram the favorite has a seat in the house of the wholly-evil spirit,”
that means “at the board of Hell.” “Realm of Hell” cannot be the mean
ing of xsa^ram, because the term for the aspect of AhuraMazdah can
not be used for its own hellish contrast. Before and after, the verses
speak of the consumption of sacrificial meat: xsa^rani is somehow
associated with eating.
The thought of Y.32,13 is similarly expressed in Arab, verses of Say
yid al-Humairl, time of al-Mansur, equally referring to a qadi: “he sits
at the day of resurrection on the bahbuhat al-nar, the seat of honor in
the fire of Hell.” Aghdnt 10,35 explain bahbuha by “midst”: “at the
Day of Djabala, the people made them sit in their midst, the bahbuha
of their house.”® This again agrees with 7^.13,100: Vistaspa, arm and
succor of the religion of Zoroaster:
yo him statam hitam who made the imprisoned,
hatim fettered one
uzvazat haca hinuwyo freed of her fetters
ni him dasta maSyoisaSam sit down on the “middle-seat.”
To understand the metaphor fully, one must put in Zoroaster for the
religion: it means the reception of the prophet as refugee. maSyoisad,
middle-seat, equals NP. sahnisin “king’s seat,”^ name of the carpet
spread at the narrow side of the reception room, opposite the entrance,

“Her (acc.fem.), kavi Vikaspa has obtained by the xsa^ra of the maga,
on the paths of Vahumano, (her) the cistis, whom the holy Ahura as
Rtam has devised.”
Cistis is at the same time knowledge, insight, also religion, and the
partial figure of AhuraMazdah, into which she has changed from the
original Usa-Eos of Y/.16. From Eos she has inherited the “house” in
which she assembles the souls in Y.30,9, see under ‘Myastra.’ maga is
the “feast, hochgezite,” see under ‘Maga,’ and this x^^^ra is either
part of the feast or, as n.abstr., “to be guest, to be host” at the feast.
The last gathic passage is Y.49,10, text under ‘Harvatat-Amrtatat’:
ya armatis izaca manza.xsa^ra vazdaha ,av3mlra‘
“This, Thou, AhuraMazdah, keepest in Thy house: the vahumano, the
souls of the believers, and their prayer.”
The place of keeping is the heavenly garo.dmana, the “storehouse,”
see under ‘Hvarnah.’ The line 49,10 has no verb; the enumeration
goes on ; the words that follow are attached, as nominatives, to “namah,
prostration, prayer,” the first pair is “obedience and zeal,” the last is
“drink-of-health and food-of-immortality.” Between these, manza.
Xsa^ra^ cannot mean “Grossherrscher” or “grosse Herrschaft ausiibend,”
as a vocative, but only something stored cool like the souls and the
heavenly food. The verses that follow continue the thought: the impious
receive in hell hellish food.
Two yasht passages make it even more obvious that this xsa^ra can
not be the word “xsa^ra, domination.”

The text seems to be what Meillet called “refondu.” To understand

There is a certain resemblance with verses in the Homeric hymn to

Yet, y/.5,i30 is a woman’s prayer. The words in g, upa.strmesu and i,
Xsa^ram zazati are transparent: the first is no compound, xsa^ram is a
wrong rendering by Aw. xs of an archet. Hor c : ci^ram. varma ? dade ?
cf. y.10,14 under ‘Homa’; “ma varama care, we do not want to reel
without senses, without being aware of it,” and Yt.iy,2-, 5,130: “varma,”
as by itself, TavTopdrov, cf. Altplnschr. 347f.—“dade” is the same form
as “care,” an unauthentic infinitive. The sentence means the same as
y?.5,87,d-e, see above. A man cannot wish to be “huvafrito, well-be
loved,” he is the lover, friyans—think of ‘ashiq and ma'shuq—the maf
‘ul must be fern. *huvafrita, cf. Hutosa’s prayer in 14,35: friya frita.

Wb. attaches nivanani to the second of its 4 Vvan-. The few passages

“huboSi, good-smelling” has in mind not flowers but the kitchen,
and the seven other words describe different smelling dishes, the long
est menu in the Awesta.
aLpacana: cf. NP. aspaz “cook,” properly “soup-cooking,”
Syr. ’spyzkn’ “innkeeper”; the place name Tpt[cr]/3d^tpa:
Turspez > Tursiz; pacika “(brick- or potter’s) kiln”; OI. asa,
“broth” in pratarasa “breakfast”; NP. nasta < *na.asta, Gr.
vria-TL^ “ieiunus”; MP. as “grits, soup” in Vid.i 6,y, as transla

the belief that as is a Turkish word. MP. as is OP. "aWn, Med.

to Aw. xsviftavant in Vid.i\,y and N.P. seVwidan “to mix and
knead wheat flour etc. in water etc.” (not Wb. : “Reiche wo man
die Peitsche schwingen lasst”).
aLborva, “with much roast,” cf. MP. pit e bor.—niSata.pitu
“with dishes set down,” either on the carpet—the eating does
not start before everything there is is set down—or “with pre
served, pickled victuals,” cf. Germ, “eingelegt, eingemacht.”
Only fro^at.aspa ’'hvanat.caxra “with snorting horses, sing

it soon will burn, while no harm is done when mills sing, cf.
“suSus ‘corn-mill,’ the noise of which deafens the devils,” Vid.
3,32. Thus ’^hvanat.caxra does not belong to the description of a
chariot, but of a kitchen. Then—with the evident misinterpreta
tion of the whole woman’s prayer by the redactors—fro^at.aspa
may be “refondu” and hide a similar word of different mean
ing: e.g. MP. frosag, made of flour, butter and honey, Arm.
hrusag, NP. Arab, frosah, afrosah. The brother of the executed
Mazyar b. Karen orders an afrosah as his last meal; and ibn
Hauqal extolls in many words the afrosah in his homeland, near
Komis, aspa may replace afsah, a kind of burghul or polenta.
Surely, this x^a^ra does not mean (Wolff-Bartholomae) “dass ich
grosse Herrschaften,” (Lommel) “Besitztum gewinne,” referring to
str.7: “worth ‘Herrschaft,’ anscheinend im Sinn ‘Reichtum.’ ” It means
a kitchen, the “realm of the housewife.”

Gortys, once traveled ... to the great-king . . . Artaxerxes presented
him with a tent . . . and a kline with legs of silver, dpyvpoTToSa,
together with the bed-maker belonging to it, saying that the Greeks did
not know how to make a bed.”
There is a famous story in Tabari 1,1048, an authentic, contemporary
record of Xusrau II in prison : “He was sitting on three namat of dibaj i
Xusrawani, royal brocades, woven with gold-threads, which were
spread over a silk busat, and was leaning against three wasa’id, woven
with gold-threads ; in his hand he held a perfectly round yellow quince.
When he saw his visitor entering, he sat up and laid the quince on the
place he had leant against, and it rolled from the highest of the three
wasa’id—it was so round and the stuffed wisad so smooth—down on
the uppermost of the three namat, and from the namat on the busat,
and neither did it come to rest on the busat, but rolled on the floor,
until at last it lay far off, covered with dust.” busat is a large carpet
covering the floor, from basata, to spread. Arab, namat is loanword,
through Aram, nmt’, from Iran, namata, originally “strewing,” later
“felt,” see under ‘Krsvar.’ Three namat are laid one above the other
to make a soft seat, wisad are cushions for head and arm, against which
one leans, “anaklinteria,” often in form of rolls, firmly stuffed. In Yif.15,
fraspat and upastarna appear together as here namat and wisad. The cor
respondence upastarna ; wisad is confirmed by NP. bistar, dial, gustar <
vistarna, “bed”; Arm. pastar < upastarna. In Esther 1,3 “white, green
and blue ‘hangings’ [i.e. fraspat], fastened with cords of fine linen and
purple to silver rings and pillars of marble,” and in Ezek^.2j,'], where
colored “sails” are described, the Armenian translator uses “pastar”
only because the lxx use Gr. o-rpaipvT)' \^str-, crTpd>vi/vp.i and their
derivatives mean making a bed, for which in Iran mattresses are char
acteristic. upa.starna are cushions, mattresses.
St.14, in the same context: “To them, the importer, abrtar, brings
gold and silver from far away lands into their nibrfla (trunk, closet, cf.
anbar), and shining, ready-made garments. . . .” Evidently the poet
thinks of Phoenician and Egyptian merchants.
Accepted translations of xsa^ra xsayante are: (Wolff-Bartho
lomae) “die Manner beherrschen die Reiche, in denen es viel zu
kauen giebt, . . . wo man die Knute schwingt, . . .” (Lommel)



142 HOSPITIUM
“gebieten in Herrschaften, wo Speise vorratig ist” (Hertel):
“herrschen dutch eine Herrschaft, die mit vielen Speisen ver
sehen ist.” If xsayante belonged to ought to govern
the genitive. It is not only improbable, but definitely wrong.
This xsa^ra belongs to a root *xsan-, Gr. ^evo?. Tedesco writes me,
as confirmation: “xsayante, likewise, is at this place passive of the same
root, to be read "^x^ayante, cf. zayate to V zan-, and in analogy to it
also in monosyllabic roots, cf. RV. tayate to Vtan-, tata-.”
In the parable in Matth.'ii, the ydixoi of the king take place in the
wix(f>a)v, which is entirely filled by the many guests. Luther’s “und die
Tische wurden voll,” fits the sense and is applicable to the gathic pas
sages. In Y.51,16, Vistaspa obtains cisti “together with” or “through the
magahya xsa^ra that is no “Herrschaft fiber den Bund,” no “Ekstase
Gymnastik” or “Ordalseance,” but a banquet: Vistaspa, walking on the
paths of Vahumano, takes a seat at the wedding table, or on the hustrta,
rug-covered, floor of the harem, where the feast takes place. Contrasting
with it, Grahma, in Y.32,13, takes a seat at the table in hell.
Xsa^ra, to Vx^^n-, is the hospitable reception. In the passages Y.32,
12-15, Y.51,16, and Y;.i 7,7 it is clearly the banquet itself; in Y.33,5,
beside avahana “relay-stage,” and in Y.44,9 beside patis xsa^rahya
“landlord” and “hadmoi, in the same house,” banquet is possible, but
rather the place of the banquet, cenaculum, ^euodoxdiov.
This result is confirmed by xsa^ra-krta in Y/.i7,57-6o, a song which
one may call “The Lamentation of RtiF’ or “Pictures of Life in a
Harem.” The word appears there beside antara.arSam, “harem.”

anyahmat arsanat and haca avahat jahikat. In 57,!, the plur.
his, instead of sg. him, relates to a.pu^ra.zana; since the word
spoils the meter, it has been interpolated along with the gloss
57,d-e. F/i.19,12 uses the formula increased by “haca avahyat
drujat, as to this druxs.” Hertel’s interpretation “wie soli ich

tion that his is genuine. The usual translation “hinab zur Erde”
of “zam avi ni.rvisyani” is impossible, for Rtis’s question “shall
I go away to heaven?” shows clearly that the earth is the place
where she is. Vrves- means “to turn, turn back etc.” Darmes
teter translated a.fra.rvisyant in Y/.i3,26 accurately by “the
fravarti who never turn their back.” Here, ni.rvisya means the
same.
Rtis is perplexed: “what shall I do?”, about three cases. The first
is the a.pu^ra.zana, the childless wife, jahikayai “slave” must have
been interpolated at an early time, for codd. as good as jio and ki 2
emend, for this reason, a.pu^ra.zana in “pu0ra.)anya, murderess of her
child.” But the adding of jahika was entirely wrong: ill luck is only to
have no children from a wife, so that the man must take a slave-girl;
but a slave had not to be replaced for that reason. The modern trans
lation “whore” of jahika is foolish: the fact that she is childless would
be only an advantage; no nation wishes to have as many “sons of a
whore” as possible.
The misunderstanding caused the gloss following in 57,d-e: the
words ma avahika, ma nipaSyahva, without correspondence in the
other stanzas and obviously no words of Rtis—who, in these verses,
does not give, but asks advice—are an admonition, here out of place,
not to go to a whore.^^
A few verses on Rtis went astray into y/.i8,3-4, viz. “fracarati/
antara.arSam nmanahya/srirahya x^^^J'^krtahya,” and “eva.paSam
nida^ati—antara.arSam nmanahya” etc., which are obviously modeled
on 17,60 and 17,6: vahvi srira pa§a nida^ati. Wolff-Bartholomae trans
late: “einen Fuss,” Lommel “den einen Fuss setzt Rtis nieder im innern
etc.” Hcrtel remarks, “the other foot,” of which nothing more is said,
“is in the heaven of light.” The following verses say: “a thousand horses
present themselves, . . . robust offspring; the whole Tistriya star, the
whole wind created by Mazdah, the whole Aryan glory grow ex

adv. “one-footed.” Wolfgang Schultz, in Orient.Stud.Favry
,
409, con
nects it as “standing on one foot” with parijasat paritacat “she walked,
ran around,” used when the goddess grants a prayer; he supposes

without knowing that this is the exact sense of ni.rvisyani—“to turn
the back” as gesture of displeasure, and sees in these expressions an
allusion to the very character of the goddess: Rtis as dancer. But eva.
arma, eva.gava mean “having but one arm” not “using one only.”
I don’t believe that evapaSam could be saved as the only good word
in this degenerate sentence. It is difficult not to see in evapaSam a cor
rupt ^avipaSam = £77^6801^, in view of OP. patipadam.
In the second lamentation, the jahlka is in her right place: a slave
girl in the harem who brings, upa.barati, to her master^' a subdititious
child that is not his. She of course gains by becoming an umm walad.
“subdititious” lies in the verb “upa.bar-.”
15,20-42: “if a bitch anywhere brings forth young ones, the owner
of the place, and in his absence a neighbor, is bound to feed her until
the young ones can take care of themselves. 43: upaca he gatum bara
yan, and they shall put (or push) underneath her a bedding!” And the
n.abstr. upabrti in Nirang.^y. “in this case the bodily injury can neither
be ‘replaced, substituted’ by fine or by corporal punishment,” viz.
after the wergildtariff.
The third lamentation has been interpreted in various ways, on insuf
ficient reasons. One can discuss “men who bring home and rape virgins
in ‘Raubehe.’ ” That would aim at this obsolete form of marriage which
was scarcely still existing at the time of the verses. The word sasta in
59,d'^ may belong to V sand-, like Aw. sadaya, OP. 0adaya “to appear
as: this did appear to me.”
Against Hertel, uz.vaSaya cannot have the same meaning as
the simplex “vaSayamna, bridegroom” (\S’ad-, to conduct.
Germ, fiihren, zur Ehe fiihren) and as upa.vaSaya ‘'to make

“ni+gam- ‘niedergehen,’ caus. zum niederlegen veranlassen,
d.i. zu sich legen, nachdem sie lange ungeschwangert geblieben
sind,” both significations under the assumption—decisive for
Hertel—that dryam is an integrant part of the sentence. But
the text had only “kaniyo uzvaSayanti, ayruvo nijamayanti.” In
Fi^.5,45 we find apu^rim nijasat “if she ‘goes down’ in ( = gets
into the condition of) pregnancy.” Verbs of motion with
definitions of condition take, in general, the meaning “to get
into, to be in a condition,” e.g. ¥^.10,95: “Mithra zam.fra0a
awiyati, goes wide-as-the-earth,” i.e. is filling (with his light)
the whole earth. Here, too, ni-jamaya is causative of the same
ni-Jas- “he allows her to remain in the ayruvo condition, does
not consummate the marriage.” dryam is a gloss; thinking of
y. 9,22-23:

refer to Homa himself; the acc. ‘^huxratum would be easier. Cf.

Haus, d.h. das Haus des Fiirsten oder Kdnigs.” The introductory for
mula, worn out in the Awesta to the breaking point, is nowhere an
integrant part of the stanzas. AhuraMazdah is in no way connected
with the “Lament of RtiL” That she is called “damidata” may be an
old feature, overlooked by the redactors and not changed into “maz
dadata.” It should not be necessary to say that the house is neither
AhuraMazdah’s nor that of any prince, but that of the man who sings
the song. Vcar-, rreXo/xai, never signifies “to walk about,” but always
the zealous activity of an “ancilla, d/Li^iTroXo?,” OP. abicariL That is
why Rtis has the epithet agrmatl—^Darius Beh. §8 agrma as word for
the men who hamtaxsanta toiled with him—and hacate “follows, be
longs to men in sar, marriage.” The stanza says: “Don’t go away, come
into my harem, where none of the things you lament about ever hap
pen!”
In y?.i8,3 the goddess goes and comes in the harem of the pretty
house, fracarati antara.arSam nmanahya srirahya. Long before, in a
letter of franchise granted by Nebuchadnezzar I (1146-1123 b.c.) to
RittiMarduk of Bit Karziapku, the Cossaean goddess Sumalia is called
(col.11,47) : “the lady of the bright mountains, she who visits the houses,
kabisat quppati” (see under ‘Architecture’).
antara.arSam > ‘andaral is the andarun, the harem. An Ira
nian house has berun, i.e. serai, dar al-‘amma, and andarun, or
sapistan, harem, dar al-khassa. But already in the Hajjiabad
inscription the Pars, equivalent for Pahl. ‘l lbr’ str’ is byrvny;
hence, Andreas’ etymology “be + ron, Aussenseite” is right
against an older one advanced by Noldeke. The adjectives of
direction formed with -ron or with -vana are numerous and
lead both in later language to -on, -un. Thus, the antonym to
beron, 'andaral seems to be assimilated to them, by way of -ul;
an 'andar.ron is improbable.

—and comes near to Arab, hadjib, properly “who keeps off the

If the house with its harem is called xsa^rakrta, this can mean only
“built for the xsa^ram (neutr.)”^'’ which takes place in the andarun,
as the ydp.0L of Matthau in the irupcjiatv: “made for receiving guests,

tries. Herodotus 11,113, describes how the refugees were stigmatized,
and thereby made property of the god, in the temple of Heracles at the
Canobic Taricheia. Something similar must have existed in pre-Islamic
Iran, for many great sanctuaries, especially the mashhads of the Imams,
and some small ones, are places of asylum to the present day, a thing
unusual in the Arabic countries of Islam.
Hence the translation of Y.29,9 is: “I, to go in clientela with a rada
without means, having only the voice of an impotent nar, ( =xsa^riya),
I, who need a wealthy xsa^riya.^”
With these words Zoroaster describes himself. In the foregoing st.8,
the cow—not with change of person Vahumano^' —laments to have
found only a single protector, Zoroaster, ready to sing its (“our ’)
praise, carkr^ra: that is the “Gatha of the Cow.” In st.9 he is, as exul,
asura, /cupio? over nothing, has neither means nor voice; therefore
(Zoroaster, speaking through the “soul of the ox”): “When will come
he, who will give him zastavant (almost:) ‘palpable’ help.?” namely
money. For isa.xsa^riya and zastavant, see under ‘Hvarnah.’^® The
“voice” means the same as fra.mruyat in Y.46,5 (see below) : the fugitive
or client cannot “speak” himself, but needs a hospes, rada as “advocate”
and guardian.
Gath, fraxsnan, too, belongs to Vxs^^n-; it resembles irpo^eveia. Wb.

Xsn^'j cf. Grdr. §86; Andreas, nggw 1931, 111,322, “zu yvCivai .?”, hence
Lommel: “um . . . kennen zu lernen.” Benveniste has proved, lnf.ai/.
59, fraxsnanam in Y.43,14 to be the accusative, fraxsnane in Y.29,11 and
43,12 the dative of the subst. fraxsnan. Only Andreas doubted the ety
mology; the translation resulting from it, “Unterweisung, instruction,”
has been generally accepted, unfit as it is, enhanced by Nyberg to
“Erkenntnis.”
Y.43,14:

“As a man, recognizing the need,"^® shall give (or: do to) his friend,
thus, o Mazdah, give me [lit.: be to me from Thee] fidelity and hos
pitality!”
Y.29,11 (see under ‘Maga’):
at mam rta yuzam mazda fraxsnane mazoi ^magaya patizanta
“honor me [the soul of the ox] with hospitality [an invitation] at the
great marriage-feast \Matth.\ yd/aot] o Mazdah, as Rtam!” Contin.:
“we want to be of your domestics!, i.e. even though we are present as
servants only!”
Nyberg, 452, note to 157: “Nehmt mich gniidig auf zu gun
sten des grossen maga, damit ich Erkenntnis erlange.” Thus,
the soul of the ox would talk like the Student to Meph
istopheles: “Ich bitt’ Euch, nehmt Euch meiner an! ... Ich
wiinschte recht gelehrt zu werden, und mochte gern was auf
der Erden und in dem Himmel ist erfassen!”
y.43,12: “And when Thou saidst to me: ‘rtam jaso fraxsnane, thou
shalt repair to Rtam (Right) for asylum!’ Thou didst not order un

hurry, before my Srosa and Rtis arrive!’ ”
Lommel-Andreas : “Und als Du mir sagtest: komm, um das
Wahrsein kennen zu lernen! da hast Du mir nichts geheissen
was unbefolgt blieb, (namlich) mich aufzumachen, bevor der
Gehorsam zu mir kommen wird, der begleitet ist von der mit
vielen Reichtiimern versehenen Vergeltung usw.” Should Truth
have been unknown to Zoroaster, and should he have been
obedient before Obedience came to him ?
Whatever the exact role of Srosa and Rtis was—the first is the “ear,”
the police, the second a Nike—the fugitive goes into the asylum inac
The usual translation “ein wissender” without obicct is empty, and “if he is able to” is
worse. The sense demands “as a man gises who recognizes the need” or “one who sees the friend in need." Cf. the natural sentence “granting the help which a friend gives to the friend” in V.g6,3, not restricted by if he is able to. isvan in mav mean *'if one is indigent” or “if one needs him." Wb. puts it to Vis-; the Pahl.transl. is “xva^ur, beggar.” I put it to Vis- “to want a thing," in Vr.15,33 with double acc. “to beg for (not “horen wollen,” Wb.)-, cf. na isamno, i.e. iKir-qs mendiant” in Y.46,6. -“For “uziradyai, hurry'” see Benveniste Inf.at-. 79.

“O Allah, I am Thy guest and Thy proteg^ and am in Thy court
and Thy haram, and Thou art the first to be hospitable to [him who
takes refuge].” That means, he claims as daif Allah all the rights the
Arab hospitium gives."^
In Y.29,9, rada {Wb. “Fiirsorger”) is the patronus, the hospes as
legal agent for the hostis, his advocate. Equally in Y.9,23, the pa^is,
husband of the woman, is her advocate and guardian, rada, cf. Yr.15,39,
where the synonym “mantu, Vormund” is used. Therefore, the neutr.
radah in Y.46,13 is not “Bereitwilligkeit, sich bereitstellen in religidser
Hinsicht, namlich das zu thun, was Mazdah und der Prophet verlangen
iWb^l' but the patrocinium, the granting of hospitium, tending to
wards “liberalitas,” hospitality, Ved. “radhas, good action, charity.” The
Pahl. translation rad.dahisnih is right: “granting of protection.” Arab,
“karama, to be hospitable” undergoes almost the same changes of
signification.
Y.46,13:
yo spitamam zara^ustram radaha
martesu xsnaus ho na frasrudyai r^wo
“Who among men listens to me, the Spitama Zoroaster, by granting
hospitium, deserves well to be praised in song!”
Thus speaks the “errant minstrel.” Cf. Y.51,12: “noit ta im xsnaus
vehviyo, not listened to him (his supplication) the Vehviya” (under
‘Vehviya’).
Lommel-Andreas: “Wer unter den Menschen den Sp. Z.

darum ist er wert gehort zu werden—der hochsten Einweihung
teilhaftig.” “Satisfying” is elsewhere a rather low predicate at
an examination.
The signification “zufrieden stellen, to satisfy,” which Bar
tholomae assigns to Vx^nu- in is entirely wrong.
Under a^a, he gives a different translation, not quoted
under Vx^nh-j of Purs.^g: “yo noit naram rtavnam hvahva
a^ahva jasantam xsndsta va xsnavayate va, wer einen auf seinen
Hof ankommenden Fliichtling nicht bewirtet oder bewirten
lasst.” This is a perfectly right result reached the wrong way:
it is not satisfaction of the stomach, but hospitium as “listening
to the supplication of the fugitive.” Cf. cixsnuso under
‘Bandva’ and ‘Vehviya.’
“To receive in hospitium, ^ivov riva vvoSix^crdaL” is expressed in
Y.46,5 by "a "dam drita (see below). The praise in song is the poet’s
thanks. In the following words Zoroaster speaks entirely as beggar:
Mazda ahum dadat, Mazda ge^a fradat! God give you life, God in
crease your family
!
The original meaning of rada has not entirely disappeared from
Middle Persian, cf. Men.Xr.: “pa rayenitarih e kar u datistan, to be legal
agent in business and in court,” and “patvand rayenitan, to become
related by marriage,” seen in its legal obligations. AhuraMazdah is
the “hame.rayenitar, patron of the world.”
In Y.33,4 the word mantus is used for something much resembling
the legal protection by the hospes, cf. under ‘ArmatiL’ Zoroaster re
moves by his prayer the “acistam mantum, fact of having the worst
mantus,” from the “gaus vastra, cow-pasture, i.e. peasantry,” cf. “gaus
lyotum, livelihood of the peasantry, the living on cattle breeding.”
To have the worst mantus is the “shadowy side” of life as peasant.
Bartholomae, Wb.282: “Das Rind, geschaffen dem Bauer und Viehziich
ter zu dienen, hat deshalb keinen Anspruch auf Recht, sondern ist
auf Wohlwollen angewiesen.” And just because, as property of man, it
is slave and without rights, the ox or cow is the symbol of the cultivator
in Zoroaster’s metaphoric idiom.
acista implies a contrast: in “removing by his prayer the evil mantus,”



HOSPinUM 153
Zoroaster designates himself as the “good mantuF’ of the bondsmen.
Therefore, in Y.29,8, “the cow has found Zoroaster as the only one”
who takes its side according to the divine order, and Y.29,9: “but he is
poor and without ‘voice,’ ” himself an exul, and hence cannot appear
and speak as patronus. In Y.28,1, Zoroaster implores help
vahos xratum manaho ya ^snavisa gausca ruvanam
“that I may listen to the will of Vahumano and to the soul of the ox”
(which is cliens), that means, that I may give it patrocinium in accord
ance with the will of God.
In Y.46,16-17, radah and mantu are combined, cf. under ‘Poetry’:
16: frasa.ukra

“Haugava Frasaustra, travel, thou, with the most ardent wishes, which
we two cherish, thither where Obedience-to-law follows the Right,
where Wordly-power is owned by Good-will, where AhuraMazdah
abides in abundance!”
Lommel-Andreas : “O Fr. Nachkomme des Hugu, dorthin
gehe mit den Einsichtigen ?, von welchen wir beide wunschen,
dass ihnen das erwiinschte zuteil werde, (dorthin) wo von
Wahrsein gefolgt ist die Fiigsamkeit, wo die begehrten Reiche

“Both we” are Zoroaster and his wife, the Haugavi, daughter of Fra
saustra. uka stoil, the word translated by “wishes,” is the exclamation
itself: “it be according to wish!,” a “please God, inshallah!,” a strong
expression of hope, see under ‘Fravarani.’
St. 17, text and explanation under ‘Poetry,’ runs: “Whither I shall
sing verses, no bad-verses [= whither my best songs accompany you],

nor “fromm und unfromm,” but to Vday- “colere” [cf. Tedesco, zii,ii,
47] “educated and uneducated,” as neutr. “what is art and what is not,”
or like Arab.-Pers. “adabi bladabi, urbanitas and inurbanitas, what is
proper and what not.” Referring to the following dahra mantu, this
quality would make 2amaspa specially apt for his diplomatic mission.
The three clauses with “where . . .” are imprecative, like Zoroaster’s
wishes: “where Right should dwell,” where he hopes to find it. The
place is obviously the highest court of appeal, the great-king himself.
Cyrus is said to have constituted this court—first mentioned under
Cambyses by Herodotus v,25 and 111,31—which consisted of seven irre
movable ySacrtXTjtoi SiKacrrai To this court the two Haugava go as
Zoroaster’s fra.ista and Trasanhya, as mantu, an instr. of quality:
because they are dahra mantu, to achieve the rescission of his verdict.
dahra is “doctus,”'" mantu the legal agent, the patron of the client
(Zoroaster and the peasantry), or the hospes of the fugitive ( 2 amaspa
and Zoroaster), hence the guardian, OGerm. foramunt."® With this the
word must be etymologically connected, and therewith with Lat.
manus. Zoroaster calls 2 amaspa dahra mantu because of his linguistic
and juridical knowledge.
In Yai 5,39, a prayer of unmarried maidens to Vayu, the same word
is disfigured:
yat nmanapatim vindama that we may find a husband
yavano sraista.krpa a young, very-handsome one
yo no hubrtam barat who treats us well
yavata java zivava as long as we both live,
frazantlmca no vrzyat and begets for us children,
dahro danto hizu.uxSo as a learned guardian, an
eloquent one.
hizu.uxSo makes sense only if it defines the husband as guardian who
must “talk” for his wife, as hu^ratu defines rada in Y.9,23. The poet
aims at Y.46,17: the nmanapatis is the guardian, pa^is and rada of the
wife, and one must read, as in 46,17, “dahra mantu.”

paign, a Munsuartu of Arazias appears, a name, the first element of
which seems to be *man^va-; the place is Aw. rzisa, Listar in Luristan.
In the Sasanian period, the mantu has developed into an official:
“yatakgow, advocate,” cf. the n.pr. Spandarmat-yatakgow, “having
Armatis as advocate” on a silver dish ami iv, 1932, 159, and Sasanian
bullae from Old Shiraz with “artaxsatr-xvarrah datware drigosane
yatakgowe, judge, advocate of the poor, of Arda&-Xurrah” ; one in my
collection: “nvt’ltxstlkn dlvFn y’tkgvy d’tvbly, advocate of the poor,
judge of NoSardasirakan.” Also Gr.Bdh.1^0: “yatakgowih e drigosan,
office of the advocate of the poor,” in Bartholomae, Mir.Mundrt.11,12.
Thus we have traced in the Awesta a number of terms that belong to
the IE. institution of hospitium, and have analogies in Gr. proxeneia
and in Germanic law. In Old Roman law, clientes and hospitium gov
ern the legal position of all who are not members of the body politic.
Foreigners, whether envoys, merchants, exiles or other fugitives, are all
hostes—etymologically = guest—and their sojourn in the country is
made possible only by hospitium. They must have a “civis, Ir. hozantus”
member of the tribe, as hospes, who looks after their business and legal
interests in the community, “kffi u datistan,” and “speaks out for them,”
Y.46,5: fra hvetave mruyat, because as hostes they have no “voice”
themselves, Y.29,9: vacam nrs asurahya.
The Roman hospitium is complemented by the notions “amicitiae
and societates,” relating to the law of nations, to which Iranian words
like rva^a, mi^ra (plur.) and haxman correspond. The right of protec
tion which the indigenous clients, Ir. aryaman, receive from their pro
tector, Ir. rada, is the clientela, the hospitium given by the hospes to
foreigners. The functions are analogous, only different in their subjects.
At a later period, the notions of patrocinium (Ir. radah) and hospitium
(Ir. Vx^an-) coalesce. The scanty Iranian material does not allow the
making of distinctions as exact as that.
rva^a"^ corresponds to Rom. amicus. The “rva^a, friendship, group of
friends,” often invoked in the Ordeal-Yasht 12 (see under ‘Last Judg
ment’), are “cojurors, compurgators,” which are called up, in many
countries, in order to demonstrate the power of the partisans, the
X>berg: “in der Mithra-Gemeinde gleich Ordalgcnosse, in der Gatha-Gemeinde aber Mysteriengenosse.”

“friendship.” The word belongs to V'var- “to choose,” original sense
“love.” The signification “friend” is outstanding in its negation, Yt.
14.38: vispe trsantu a.rva^a vispe trsantu dusmanyus
“all non-rva^a shall tremble, all enemies shall tremble!” dusmanyus is
“Sucr/aer-T]?, NP. dusman, enemy”; the negation a.rva 0a is a full
synonym; without negation it is eu/acvrj?, friend, NP. dost. That is also
valid for OP. rva^a and arvastam. rva^a is amicus or socius as legal
term when associated with hospitium and clientela. Wherever com
panions are called rva^a, it is so because rva^a means “friend”; the
words do not lose their universal human signification when used as
legal terms.
These researches throw new light on the gatha 46, of high importance
for the life of Zoroaster.

then does, he could comfortably have done at home: “seine
einzige Hoffnung auf AhuraMazdah setzend,” the prophet
begins his mission in his new, Mithra-worshipping parish
(263): “indem er einfach [simply] an die Mithra-Religion

Wb.: “fliehen, eigentl. sich biicken.” Andreas-Lommel : “entweder l.sg.

nowhere the signification “to flee,” not even with the prev. fra-, but
“to lie prostrate, lie low.” y/.i9,34 says the same with other words:
“Yama, expulsed from paradise, dausmanahyaica ho strto nidarat,
hides prostrate in despair.” The meaning is neither “flight,” nor “turn
ing in a different direction,” but the attitude of prostration, like that of
a hiding animal, pari-da means solemnly “to consecrate, make ‘sacer’ to
the gods”; with the abl. “away from hvetu and aryaman” it means “to
cast out from” as a sacrilegus. The Pahl. transl. be dat, expl. be kirt,
“severed from, outcast” is right. Vx^nu- does not signify “to favor”
or “to please,” but, as in OP., “to hear, to obey,” cf. AltpJnschr. s.v.

aster complains about his poverty, as proscriptus. In 3, he hopes for the
“dawn of day” and believes in his victory. St.4—see under ‘Bandva’:
“Who deprives the drugvant [whose doing this exile is] of his rule

Further, st.6: “Who refuses the refugee that implores, isamno,"^ is a

unworthy self.?” St.8; “Thou, AhuraMazdah, art the only ahura, lord

to, receives Zoroaster, merits to be praised!” St.14: see under ‘YTahi!’;
Vikaspa has become Zoroaster’s patronus. In the following verses the
Haugava brothers travel to the court to obtain the rescission of the

(dat.) abl.pl., the “social bonds, societates,” on which society rests (see
under ‘Mithra’). The two ablatives follow the verb and frame hozan
tus, hence mean: “Who . . . receives, because as member of the tribe he
is bound to do so by amicitiae and societates.” rasna jivans renders a
similar thought: one who lives according to the mores that bind him
to give protection. Cf. (under ‘Kavi’) y.49,1: “he who, being my
bandva, yet listened to the verdict! thereby failing in his duty”; and
Y.51,12: The Vehviya, being a kavi, yet refused hospitium, though
peership obliged him to give it. All expressions are argumentative, not
descriptive. The translation is:
“He who, be he satrap, receives the stranger (lit. him who arrives)
according to the fides or, be he a member of the tribe, according to the
societates, who lives as the moral obligations require, and who, (him
self) an rtavan, knows to distinguish a drugvant—that one shall, then,
speak for him to his peers and protect him from sanguinary deeds, 0
AhuraMazdah!”
Lommel-Andreas : “Oder wenn einer, der die Macht (das
Vermdgen dazu) hat, einen, der zu ihm kommt, aufnimmt,
und bei sich behalt auf Grund von Vertragen und Freund
schaftsbiindnissen, ein Mann aus edlem Stamme, der nach dem
Recht lebt, wenn er ein Wahrhaftiger, der andre aber ein Liig
ner ist, und wenn er die Entscheidung dariiber hat—so soli er es
seinen Hausgenossen sagen, um ihm, o Weiser, gegen Gewalt
thaten zu helfen, o Herr!” Note: “ad^s drita ayantam, Andreas:
wenn er aufnehmend einen zu (ihm) kommenden (bei sich)
behielte.” In this way, the noble man, in power, makes a treaty
of friendship with the liar, has the decision, but is obliged to
make the presence of the fugitive known, in order to protect
him against violence, which only strict secrecy could achieve.
Bartholomae construed yo rtava drugvantam in parallel with
yo xsayans ayantam, both governed by the verb as which he
understood ,adqns drlta‘. In this way, the xsayans hozantus
becomes the rtavan, and the ayans, Zoroaster, becomes the drug
vant. Even though—with Bartholomae’s interpretation of adans
drita—it would not be Zoroaster, but somebody unknown, this
is impossible: “Wenn ein Kundiger einen festzuhalten vermag.



l6o HOSPITIUM
nachdem er ihn dazu gebracht hat, von seinem Geliibde und
seinen Bindungen weg (zu ihm) iiberzugehen” would be the
conversion of a drugvant achieved by suborning to perjury and
breach of faith, and the following stanza says: “For he is him
self a drugvant, who favors a drugvant.” Hence, one shall not
convert a drugvant, nor—as it ought to be translated—“give
asylum” to one. 10,5-6: “Do not turn aside into a road
of the heathens, do not enter a town of the Samaritans.”
Bartholomae’s construction isolates the words viciro hans,
which do not signify “die Entscheidung treffend,” nor “wenn
er dessen sicher ist”: vi.ci- means to distinguish, hiayvavai
of the judge or of the critic, for instance in the same gatha,
st.15: “yat da^an vicaya^a ada^ansca,” and 17: “yo vicindt
da^amca ada^amca.” If the antonyms rtavan and drugvant
precede a viciro, they can only be the object of distinction. The
complex expression viciro hans “being distinguisher” has, like
the part. *vicinvans or like the noun-of-agent, the verbal power
to govern the acc. obj. drugvantam, cf. OP. Oramazda.te janta
biya! Hence “who is distinguishing, (being himself) an rtavan,
a drugvant (acc.),” that is, who recognizes that not the con
victed fugitive, but the judge who convicted, is the true drug
vant.'®
All translators construct in such a way that the first va connects the
stanza with the preceding one: “on the path ... he leads, who . . .
kills, or who. . . .” The contents of the stanzas are not closely enough
related to permit that. Rather, yo va xsayans belongs together with
hozantus, as if it was va xsayans va hozantus, and the second va is
only omitted, because this pair intersects the other rvatois va—mi^roi
byo va. The same construction is found in Beh, §14: adam niya0''arayam'‘

Before it says: “who kills the drugvant, prepares the path of cistis
(religion)”; after: “who receives the fugitive.” The same granting of
protection is expressed, in 13, by “who listens, x^naus < xsnavis, to
Zoroaster.” The one who arrives, ayant, is Zoroaster, who asks in st.i
:
“ku^ra ayani, where shall I go.?”, the “poor” of st.2; the “imploring”
of st.6 ; “my humble self” of st.7. The one who receives is the same who
fulfils in st.3 the hope for the “dawn,” gives protection in 7, shall go to
heaven in 10, and who is Zoroaster’s “friend for (at) the maga, and
wants to be praised by him in song: He, kavi Vistaspa,ya-ahi!”
Vikaspa is the x^ayant of the dahyu to which Zoroaster fled. Of
course, xsayant, with a following verb, can mean “having the power to
exercise” the activity of that verb. This would even make sense: power
ful enough to receive Zoroaster, without being afraid of the lord jus
ticiary who validated the verdict. But the explanation would impair
the necessary parallelity of va xsayans and va hozantus, which de
mands “satrap and civis.” Vistaspa is the xs^Y^i^h *^he
province, and the Haugava are its cives. As hospites they must “speak”
fra mruyat, for Zoroaster, who, as a fugitive, has no “voice,” before their
peers, hvetu, to protect him against attentates, xrunyat. Zoroaster is
outlawed—pari dadati—“vogelfrei,” and threatened by murder.
The juridical terms which Zoroaster uses in this situation, razan,
rvati, mi^ra, also rtavan, are the legal notions of bygone days upon
which the pre-Zoroastrian society was built, descending from the ius
talionis, the blood revenge, drugvant is the only Zoroastrian term in this
gatha, replacing older mi^radruxs. The god of social order was Mithra,
therefore we shall meet these terms again in the Mithra yasht, from
which their full understanding can be abstracted.
Zoroaster looks for asylum and finds it with Vistaspa, in Parthava.
In the following verses the two Haugava set out on their journey to the
residence of the great-king, to obtain the revocation of his proscription.



IX. HOUSE HAUGAVA
In Y.51,16 Zoroaster says that kavi Vistaspa has received him as fugi
tive, in 17 that Frasaustra, in 18 that Zamaspa are his friends. These
two are the Haugava, the former the father of Zoroaster’s wife, Hau
gavi. The name is written hvogva in the gathas, hvova in Y/.i3,ii8, a
patron.adj. with vrddhi of hugu, hence haugava, fern, haugavl.
Members of this family, enumerated in the memorial list, are:
Zamaspa, a son Hanharvah, a grandson Varsna, and a Zamaspa apara
zata “junior,” another grandson or a great-grandson. Frasaustra, with
two sons, Husyo^na and Hvadena, and the daughter Haugavi. Another
member is probably Avara.ustris with a son Vahunamah and a grand
son Gevanil In jrgm.Darmst.j, varsnahe 0wam '’hanharusois jamas
panahe pu^rahe pu^ram, it is not an anonymous son (Wb.i^Sg) of
Varsna, but himself who is invoked against an unknown evil called
varsna: “of V. (gen.), thee (acc.), HanharuF (gen.), the Jamaspian
son’s (gen.), son (acc.),” construed like the genealogy of Artaxerxes II
in his Susa inscriptions, hanharus.ois, as there darayavauLahya, with
false gen. termination attached to the nominative.
The question in the “Gatha of the Cow,” Y.29,9: “When will come
he who will give him [Zoroaster] zastavat avo, practical help ?” aims
at Zamaspa and Frasaustra, important for the chronological sequence
of the gathas.
The Haugava were hvetu and very wealthy, Yl.5,g8 : “for riches asked
the Haugava.” In Y.51,18, Zoroaster himself calls Zamaspa “istois
hvarna, blessed with riches.” The words show that Zamaspa, not Fra
saustra, was the chief of the house as the elder brother. In Y.49,7 Zoro
aster asks “which hvetu will obtain the frasasti.?” and expects it (st.
8 and 9) from Frasaustra as fra.ika and Zamaspa as fsanghyo. In
Y.46, 16-17, after Zoroaster’s marriage to the Haugavi, the two brothers
set out on their journey to obtain the frasasti. In Y.53, the “Wedding
Gatha,” Zamaspa and Frasaustra are fathers and grandfathers of the
young couples.
The name of the elder Haugava is written in Gath, dajamaspa, in
Aw. jamaspa. The same spelling is used once more in Gath, dajit.arata.

Aw. jit.asa, in a gloss da)- is no syllable with a vowel, but one
phoneme.
In Paikuli the spelling is Pahl. z’m[sp], Pars. d’m[’]sp.^ In the Pars,
version of the Ka‘ba inscr. the family name is spelled d’mspvhrykn.
Therefore BPars. (e.g. Zarern., Art.Vtr.Ndm.) d’m’sp—though d = y
and exceptionally = z—is better read “damasp.” The brother of Kavat I,
on his coins, writes z’m[sp or -’sp].—^The Greek forms are Zamaspes,
Zamasphes, e.g. in a versified inscription from Susa, time of Phraates
III or IV. But Ctesias, who spoke Old Persian, calls the wife of Arta

must have been the XpTjo-et? ^TcrTaairov, also known to Ammian Marc,
at the same date, Greek paraphrase of an Ir. ‘Zamaspnamak.^
There were two dialectic forms, with z and d, opposed like Aw.
zamatar, NP. damad, 01 . jamatar. The Gr. z, and so Syr. zamasp,
express clearly this opposition, but are neutral for the problem raised by
Arm. jamasp and Shahn. jamasp, since their z represents Ir. z, z and ).
Inscriptional Pars, z is only z; inscr. Pahl. z is z and z.
dajit.arata is to be classed under the type of compounds
Duchesne §§206 and 207: part.perf. in -ta plus rta; '"dojita.rta.
The vowel o, introduced by Aw. script only in the middle of the
4th century a.d. and revealing that Aturpat did no longer under
stand what the Arsacid double notation meant, must be
eliminated: "djita.rta. djita is part.pref. of \^*)ya-, attested in
Gathic by n.abstr. fra.jyati, IPA “Verderben,” Andreas “Be

the root has two different notations in Gathic, dop- and Jy-, and
the problem is for the greater part a graphic one. The Awestic
notation is likewise double.

in Beh. §30, in the date formula “^auravaharahya mahya
Jyamnam pari, Akk. on the 30th of Aiiaru,” hence “when the
^oravara moon had decreased.” Just as early Parsik borrowed its
ideogr. byrh (with prep, hi- “in the month”) for “m^, month”
from the Aram, date formula used since the Achaemenian
period, or as late Parsik borrowed “bar mah” (with Med. bar <
upari) from the Pahlavik formula, thus OP. borrowed its date
formula with Jyamnam from the language of Median chancery.
Inscriptional Jyamna is not OP., but Median, like Aw. Jyamna.
The rendering of OP. syata by El. sa.t.ta, Xerx.Pers.daiv., in
478 B.C., and of ‘purusyatis by Gr. parysatis, show that since 500
B.c. the y of sy was lost, probably without influencing the pro
nunciation of s. As to Jy: Aw. hujyati, Gr. hygieia, and vispa.
hujyati, against 5e/i.§35 vispauzatis, El. wi.s.p.o.ca.ti.s, name of
a town in Parthava, in 520 b.c., foursyllabic as in Yi:.5,i3o:
Tarnahvantam ''vispojyatim (see under ‘Hospitium’), show that
already in 520 b.c. Jy was pronounced z, or even z. When OP.
Jyamnam was borrowed from Median chancery, the pronuncia
tion was not what the signs indicate. Cuneif. J‘ i y®- must imitate
a Median spelling in script; Gath, daj- renders the Aramaic
symbols of the archetype, ist century a.d., for a sound trans
mitted only by word of mouth.
The second Aw. spelling is V**zya-, pres, zinat in Y.11,5,
with double acc.; part.perf. act. zizyusa, without object, and
comp, with fra- (as also fra.Jya-) in pass, frazyanta/e. To it
belongs the pre-Zoroastrian term mi^ra.zya, syn. of mi^ra.
dru^s and mi^ra.gan. ITA1770 gives Vzya- the signification
“jem. um etw. benachteiligen.” zinat corresponds (as does
Jinati) to OI. jinati. V zya- and VJya- are the same word in two
modes of spelling. The pronunciation of zy- must have been z
since the end of the 6th century b.c.
In OP. Vdya- corresponds; pres, dina, part.perf. dita = Gath.
dojita-, Aw. Jit(a), equally construed with double accusative. In
Beh. §§12,13: “Gomata adina, deminuit, impaired, deprived
Cambyses of the xsa^ram”; “nobody else dared xsa^ram ditam
caxriya, to make him deprived, deminutum of the xsa^ram”;
“I, Darius, adinam, deminui, deprived him of the xsa^ram.”



HOUSE HAUGAVA
Finally Beh.^i^: “abicaris tyadis gomata adina, the vassals . . .
of whom Gomata deminuit, had deprived them.” The djita.rto
prta.tanuvo of the Gatha is Gomata, whom Darius makes dita
of his rulership and life. For the style cf. Y.46,4:
“yas.tam xsa^rat . . . moi^at jyatos va, who deprives (moi^at
to Vmi^-, Lat. mutare) him of xsa^ram and life,” and y.53,9:

The phonetic equation OI. jinati, Aw. zinat, OP. dina, and
the relation of Gath, dajamaspa. Aw. jamaspa, OP. damaspia
to OI. jamatar. Aw. zamatar, NP. damad, rule out an initial
palatal in inscr. jyamnam as well as in Gath, dajita.rta, daja
maspa. Aw. jamaspa, jyamna. Not even the survival of Aw.
jamaspa in Arm. jamasp (as late as Sebeos), Shahn. jamasp, can
prove it. Inscr. j’ i y”* m* n® transliterates the Median spelling
of a word which even at that antiquity was not pronounced jy-.
Gath, daj- represents the Arsacid notation, either *ds or ‘dz,
preferably *dz. Aw. |y is a simplified notation of this Gath.
d3|-<*dz, as is e.g. Aw. bit(i)ya to Gath. da‘ bP, OP. d“vi‘’.
The Aw. spelling j is enough to have caused the name to be
pronounced jamaspa since the 4th century a.d., against ety
mology. I choose the transcription zamaspa and zitarta merely
to indicate the problematic character: written dj or ), yet corre
ponding to OP. d, hence in essence a z (dialectically z ?), not a ]
(dialectically z?).
Markwart saw in such double notations “phonetische Glos
sen,” as if the words were written in two dialects at the same
time. Assuming *dz as Ars. notation of Gath, daj-, this would
mean: “written d-, spoken z-,” and would cover also the case
dab-: “Pers. d, Med. b.” But a modification is obviously neces
sary: ds, ts etc. is pahlavik style, attested 70 years before the
Awesta was first written in Aramaic script; and daj- must be
traced back to that first writing. But a “phonetic gloss”‘“ could
only gloss the pronunciation of something written before, hence
the theory implies some written Awesta before that first com

plete writing under Volagases I, as Markwart assumed, for
other, but erroneous reasons.
That the name Zamaspa had an OP. correspondent in Damaspa is
certain. Andreas’ emendation ^Yamaspa cannot be maintained. If the
Arsacid double notations were indeed “phonetic glosses,” there would
not only be two forms, but the OP. form with d would be the primary
form, and the name of the vispatis of the Haugava would be Old Per
sian. That is probable, even if the premise of this deduction would be
wrong; avara.ustris is also an OP. name. What matters historically is
that the name of the Haugava Zamaspa is closely connected with the
Achaemenid house.
While Zama.aspa and Frasa.ustra were at the court of Vikaspa when
he gave Zoroaster hospitium, there was a Prexaspes i.e. Frasa.aspa, the
cup-bearer, at the court of Cambyses, a Persian. Through him Cam
byses had given the order, in 525 b.c., to have Smerdis secretly executed
in prison. And when Cambyses, after the appearance of the Pseudo
Smerdis, asked him whether the order had been effected, he answered:
“If ^astyartes (astva. rta, not Astyages) will appear and the dead will
rise, then you may expect to see Smerdis again!” The words are so
utterly Iranian that no Greek could invent them and that Herodotus
misunderstood his own story, as shown by the somewhat amazed gloss
“the Median” to the name Astyages. The words show that Prexaspes
had heard of Zoroaster’s doctrine of the last judgment and the appear
ance of the sosyant Astvatrta at the end of the world; the tenor of the
story is evidently: “If it is true, what some people now say that. . . .”
According to the rules of IE. onomastics, one must regard as brothers
three men, contemporaries, that bear so closely related names as zama.
aspa, frasa.ustra and frasa.aspa. Darius had a mace-bearer, va8'’abara,
Aspacina = Aspathines, whom he honored exceptionally by having him
depicted at Naqsh i Rustam. Aspathines had a son Prexaspes (II), hence
was certainly a son of Prexaspes I. In the Arsacid and Sasanian periods
all court offices were hereditary; here, the mace-bearer of Darius is the
son of the cup-bearer of Cambyses. The \itdb Baghdad, fol.ior, tells in
204 H. : “The caliph, al-Ma’mun, said to ‘Abbas b. Musayyib b. Zubair,
sahib al-shurta, who suffered from gout: You have grown old, the

bearing of the lance comes hard to you! ‘Abbas: Here is my son at my
place, it was my office and my father’s, and we are the people of the
lance!”
Against Beh. §68, w’here Darius remembers his six companions,
Herodotus tells a version in which Aspathines is one of the seven.
He must have been close to them to be reckoned as one of them, for
instance as a nephew of the two Haugava. His father Frasaspa was the
man who knew that the Pseudo-Smerdis was an impostor, and through
him his brothers 2amaspa and Frasaustra, and therewith the circle
round Vistaspa, may have had the proof of the fact, all-important to
them, who after the extinction of the elder line were the heirs claiming
the succession. Brzyarkis-BrSya had been one of their circle. Aspathines,
though not one of the seven, belonged to the same group as Darius and
his friends at the court of his father Vistaspa in Tosa. One sees wffio
were the initiated of whom Darius says in Beh. §§12-13: “The kara was
in fear of him, he might kill many who had known Smerdis before;
for that reason he might kill them, that nobody may recognize that I
am not BrSya, Cyrus’ son.” Having a brother who was Cambyses’ cup
bearer would explain why it was the Haugava who went to the court
to obtain the frasastis for Zoroaster, and would at the same time explain
Prexaspes’ answer to Cambyses.
Zamaspa is a typical man’s name; the gentilic in y/.i3,i04 and frgm.
Darmst. 7, is jamaspana. And, compared with Hutosa, Humaya, Puru
cista etc., Damaspia is no personal name of a woman, but, like Hau
gavi, Frani, 0riti, Spitami the fern, of the gentilic ‘damaspiya. It desig
nates the queen as “nee Damaspi,” of the house of Zamaspa, just as
Haugavl designates the wife of Zoroaster as “of the house of the Hau
gava” Frasaukra, brother of Zamaspa. This old house—like that of the
Vivana-Vefikan—appears still at the time of Shahpuhr I in Kaba I.31:
“Narsahe e vaspuhr e damaspuhrikan,”® a form of the name which is to
zamaspana as gewpuhr is to Vivana.
Ctesias tells that after the death of Artaxerxes I, in 424 b.c., Xerxes II,
son of Damaspia, succeeded as the entitled heir among the 17 sons.

ing Skythianos, the alleged predecessor of Mani and the OP. social
term skau^is—a son of the Babylonian Alogune. Ochos, satrap of
Hyrcania, and Arsites, sons of the Babylonian Kosmartydene. Baga
paios, son of the Babylonian Andia ( ?), brother of Parysatis, the mother
of Artaxerxes II and the younger Cyrus. Obviously, as Xerxes I, Xerxes
II was heir-apparent because of the higher rank of his mother. After
45 days, he was murdered by Sekydianos; on the same day Damaspia
died. Both were brought es Ilepo-a?, to Persepolis, and buried there,
at Naqsh i Rustam, in the tomh of Artaxerxes I, opposite the Ka‘ba i
Zarduk.
At the time of the memorial list, about 527 b.c., Zamaspa had already
a grandson Varsna and another, or a great-grandson, Zamaspa II.
Zoroaster’s gatha 51, composed—not before 521—for the double wed
ding of a son and his only daughter from the Haugavi, Purucista,
mentions Zamaspa and Vistaspa as present. They are there because
they give away a son (or grandson) and a daughter (or granddaughter)
in marriage to the two children of Zoroaster (see under ‘Maga’).
Purucista’s bridegroom, not called by name, may well have been a
grandson, or if Zamaspa was born in 591, 22 years older than Zoro
aster, a great-grandson of his.
In a hopeless attempt at disproving the identity of the historical and
the Awestic Vistaspa, Nyberg says, 357; “. . . da muss man sich
hochlichst dariiber wundern, dass Darius, der in Beh. §68 seine Heifer
aufzahlt, so ganzlich den trefflichen Frasaustra und Jamaspa vergessen
hat, gar nicht zu reden von dem Propheten selber, aber diese ganze
Konstruhtion ist so unsinnig wie nur etwas sein hann.” I do not believe
that the brothers deserve the trivial, trifling “trefflich,” at any rate they
helped Zoroaster, not Darius. And Zoroaster himself, who had recom
mended the murder, when discussing §68 with Darius, may have
preferred, as a prophet, not to have this remembrance publicly per
petuated, for, as Nyberg says, 395: “Was sie in ihrem Innersten dachten,
wissen wir nicht.” Yet it seems that Darius did not at all forget the old
gentleman Zamaspa, whom he had known in Tosa—nor his money.
Since Darius’ first grandchild Artystone (II), a daughter’s daughter,
du^^ is, was born in 506 b.c., his first grandson by a son, Artaxerxes I,
was born after 506. Damaspia, if a daughter of Zamaspa II and Puru
cista, may have been born about the same time. But since Artaxerxes I



HOUSE HAUGAVA 169
and Damaspia died only in 424 b.c., Damaspia was rather a grand
daughter of Zamaspa II, in that case born about 488. Even then, Darius
may have prearranged this marriage of his grandson still at his lifetime.
He may have said to Zamaspa II : “I remember well your ancestor and
namesake, and have been told a granddaughter has been born to you;
I beg you, to leave to me her affairs, because I wish my grandson and
future successor to marry her !”
Since we “do not know what such great lords thought in their heart,”
it is good at least to read how men of their kind talked at a later
period. Tabari iii,i457f. tells for instance—Nyberg, 310, calls such an
analogy an “Indizienbeweis” : “al-Muntasir left, late in the evening, the
reception hall of his drunk father al-Mutawakkil ‘ala’llah. When
leaving, he took the hand of the majordomo Zurafa (giraffe), saying:
Come with me! Z.: O my lord, the Commander of the Faithful is not
yet risen from the table! M.: Wine has overpowered the Commander
of the Faithful, Bogha [commander of the Guard] and the guests will
leave shortly. I want to beg you to leave to me the affairs of your chil
dren. Utamish [later vizier] has asked me to marry his son to your
daughter, and your son to his daughter! Z.: We are your slaves, my lord,
order us as you please!” Bunan, the singer, told: “Muntasir said to me:
I just have married the son of Zurafa to the daughter of Utamish, and
the son of Utamish to the daughter of Zurafa! I said: My lord, where
are the ‘nith^’ (money etc., strewn over the guests), the nicest thing
at a wedding? M.: Tomorrow morning, inshallah, the night is almost
past! Shortly after, one hears noise and cries, and Bogha, who had just
killed al-Mutawakkil, enters. Muntasir asked : What means the noise ?
B.: Only good news, O Commander of the Faithful! M.: Woe betide
you, what do you say? B.: Allah reward you amply for [form of an
nouncing a death] our lord the commander of the faithful [al-Muta
wakkil]; Allah’s slave [Muntasir as ‘abd-allah wa khalifatuhu] has
prayed, and He has heard his prayer!”
Frasaustra is called fbnghyo in Y.31,10; the acc. is spelled fbnghim
in Y.49,9; at both places the word is one syllable short. Bartholomae
translated “fdrderlich,” and, without giving an etymology of his own,
called Darmesteter’s a “Schaueretymologie,” (IFA1029). Andreas:

who himself translates “der sich (durch Vohu Manah) binden lasst”
without saying more about this Houdini act. H. W. Bailey, equally
rejected by Nyberg, had considered in bsos \ii,275f., ‘fsahya, syn. of
fsuyant “farmer.” None of these proposals cures the metric deficiency.
¥^.31,9-10 (full text and commentary under ‘ApamNapat’)
:
at hi aya fravarta vastriyam ahyai fsuyantam
ahuram rtavanam vahos ,fbnghim‘ manaho
noit mazda avastriyo dvanscina humrtois baxsta
“Suppose Thou wouldst let the ox have its own way, to leave either the
vastriya or him who is not a vastriya, it would choose between the two
for itself the vastriya.fsuyant, as a good patron, a fs. of Vahumano. The
non-farmer shall have no share whatever in the account [division of
profit] !”
Zoroaster opposes often a notion and its negation, and where he
uses the a priv., this implies, in contradistinction to the Awestic usage,
always the opposition of good and bad. Y.49,4: “fsuyasu afsuyanto, the
bad ones among the cattle-breeders”; y.46,17: “afsmani noit an.afsmam,
verses, not non-verses,” meaning really good ones. In his didactic style,
lob is the reason: “because he is a fs. of Vahumano, Good-Will,” and
fsanghyo cannot be a syn. of fsuyant, for that would be an explanation
“by virtue of a virtue.”
The second place is clear enough. Y.49 begins with the two stanzas
about the bandva and his tkesa, see under ‘Bandva.’ In st.7 text under
‘Social Structure,’ Zoroaster asks: “which aryaman, which hvetu, will
obtain, through data, the good frasasti for the vrzanam.?” He expects
it from the Haugava. St.8 “give Frasaustra the most welcome wedding
to Rtam . . . , for ever we want to be the fra.istaho, envoys!” St.9, text
under ‘Ya-ahi!’:
srotu sasna ,fs3nghyo‘ suve tasto
“He shall proclaim the orders, the fL, destined for my salvation, who
as a duly-speaking one rejects all fellowship with the drugvant, . . .
ya-ahi, triumph, Zama.aspa!”
The drugvant, with whom Zamaspa does not want to deal, is the
bandva of st.i. The activity of the fbnghyo is to proclaim orders, de
crees. The stanzas about the two brothers are built in strict parallelism:



HOUSE HAUGAVA I7I
fra.ista and fsanghyo are analogous notions, and the verses play upon
the words frasasti, sasna (both to Vsanh-), fra.ista and fsanghya.
In Y.50,1 a similar pair of words is used; cf. 49,12 under ‘Poetry’:
kat moi ruva ise cahya avaho
“How little help has my soul got from any one, whom have I found as
protector, ^ratar, of my herd and myself, (as my) azda zutar, but Thee,
AhuraMazdah, Rtam and Vahumano!”
Bartholomae: “Ob wohl meine Seele bei irgend jemand auf
Hilfe zu rechnen hat.?” Lommel: “Uber was an Hilfe und von
wem verfiigt meine Seele.?”
azda zutar (for zotar < zavitar, to V zu-, zba-) in parallel with
^ratar must be understood as a poetical expression for the official
“azdakara, herald” of the papyri. Xerxes writes: “patiyazbayam: deva
ma yaSyesa!, I made proclaim: The deva shall not be worshipped!”
patiy.azbayam is a Median term of administration. Aw. V zba-, zbaya-,
Akk. apteqira; pati seems to restrict the notion to “proclaiming a
prohibition.”
All these words are terms of official functions. Aw. fra.ista, is OP.
Trestaka, in Aram, ’frstky’, lxx: ^apecrOaxa'ioi, Ezra 4,9: “R^hum, the

Akk. ^"ip.ra.sa.ka.nu in the business documents of Murasu Sons (u.m.

the Lex. Rhet. Photios on the (crayydSai and) rrapa.ua.yyai which
“may equally well designate the messenger as the mile-stone,” the

“^apcraxato5 (public) crier” is the word one needs in Y.49,9 and
which fits in 31,10. fsanghyo which is one syllable short, must be
^“plenipotentiary,” cf. Altp.lnschr. 318; Landsberger, aof x, 1935, i4off., in a text of Nimurta.TukuI.Assur, translates Ass. tema sakanu by “zu befehlen haben”; but b®‘el t^‘cm is one who has a written order, a letter patent. ^ ”tif.sar Akk. dubsar; text: trpK’.

crdaxcuov and ^apa-axaloi are a common pair: rasul and nabi, or
aTTocTToXoi and 7rpo<^7jTai of the original Christian community in
Jerusalem/ “frasanhyo frasastim frasanhati, the herald proclaims the
frasasti.”
There must have been several kinds of heralds. Governmental edicts,
military orders, court sentences and many other things require publica
tion, and frasasti, proclamation was the only means, typty, tpty in
Daniel 3,2,12 and in PapStrassb. is 0epati < *0ahyapati, “maitre
de la proclamation” or chief-herald,"^ and OP. 0ahya is the simplex to
Med. fra.sanhya. The officer is enumerated between judge and police,
and the frasanhya seem to have been the special outcriers of the courts.
In the Muhammedan time the army had spokesmen or commissioners
of their own, the za‘im al-djuyush. Cf. Beh. §60: “yaSi imam handun
gam . . . karahya 0ahi—in the preceding § it is the imper. ^adi—if you
proclaim this edict to the army,” or in wider sense “the free men”; also
the unknown prototype of Aram, kffioza® in Daniel 3,4.
What the frasanhya proclaims is the frasasti, proclamation. Bartho
lomae translated “Leumund.” “leu” is OHG. hliu, Gr. jcXefo?, Ir.
sravah, which expresses that notion in Iranian, with its derivatives, e.g.
husravah, dussravah, cf. Tistriya Yr.8,4:
“haca brzyat hausravaham, from the high one (ApamNapat) is his
fame!”, or the curse of Homa, Y.ii^z:
uta buya a.frazantis uta daussrava hacimno
“childless thou shalt be and followed by shame!” Also vahau sravahi in
Y.30,10. Vsanh- “pronuntiare,” never takes this connotation, nor do the
roots vak- and V mru-.
How big a mistake this translation was, becomes manifest by
Nyberg’s elaboration. 243, on Y.49,7: “Wer ist der aryaman, wer
der xvaetu, nach den (gottlichen) Gesetzen, der dem varazana
guten Ruf geben kann?” Comm.: “Wo findet, so meint er,

One is socius and civis not by (divine) but by (civil) law, nor
are there divine laws for the special case that leading men are
found wanting, however frequent that may be. If ever the mis
guided idea had occurred to Zoroaster to mend the bad reputa
tion of his enemies, he ought to have deleted the insult offered
to the vaepyo in Y.51,12, and the invitation to kill them, at the
occasion, when (Nyberg, 247) “er selber seine Gesange fiir den
liturgischen Gebrauch seiner Gemeinde zusammenstellte und
mit einer—natiirlich nicht schriftlichen (sic) —Einleitung ver
sah.”
Thus Bartholomae failed to recognize this greatest event in Zoro
aster’s life, on which the introductory words put the highest emphasis:
“AhuraMazdah shall hear it as Vahumano, shall hear it as Rtam, hear
it Thyself, o AhuraMazdah! Who is the aryaman, who the hvetu, who
through data will obtain for the vrzanam the good frasasti?”
The “good” frasasti—“bad” would be an interdict—is obtained by
data, OP. “tya mana data, my, the great-king’s laws,” “the inviolable
dat, law of the Medes and Persians” in Daniel, a term borrowed also
by Akkadians and Elamites. What Zoroaster hopes so passionately to
have “proclaimed” is the rescission of his banishment, “vrzanam, city,”
IS either the town where the proclamation takes place, or his “religion”
as fictitious “community.” In both cases, the revocation of the verdict
is the authorization for his teaching. We know from Daniel and Ezra
that every religious community needed an official authorization, and
Xerxes’ “interdiction of the deva cult” is the negative side of the frasasti
for Zoroaster.
There is one other place where frasasti has its full meaning: Y/. 10,60:



HOUSE HAUGAVA

The cult of Mithra, long years prohibited (see under ‘Mithra’ and
‘Deva’) obtained again the agreement of the government. The hideous
verses were composed when the “proclamation, frasastis” by Artaxerxes
II belonged already to a not distant past, after 400 b.c., but before Alex
ander, before 330 b.c. Because the proclamation is a sanction, the true
sense fades at late, empty and bad places.’^"
It is nowhere said whether the mission of the Haugava was a success
or not. In ¥.46—separated from the time of Y.51 by Zoroaster’s mar
riage to the Haugavi, not necessarily a long interval—the brothers set
forth on their journey. In 49 Zoroaster hopes that they will obtain the
frasastis, at a moment when he foresees already the end of Cambyses
and, at the same time, hopes that this would entail the downfall of
Gomata. If Y.46 is all of one piece and if no new gatha begins, e.g. in
st.6, the attempt seems to have been made before Cyrus’ death. ¥^.9,26
implicates Hutosa in it; that is not history, like the gathic passages, but
might retain some truth: Atossa’s influence upon her father Cyrus.
If Y.49 is a unit, the frasasti was not yet granted at the end of Cambyses’
reign. One must expect that it was not granted before the death of
Cambyses, but only after the gatha Y.53,8-9, by Darius.
The sanction of Zoroastrism did not mean the eradication of the old
cults. Zoroaster’s doctrine did not live on as a separate religion, because
fundamentally it was much too spiritualized ever to become a popular
cult. It is the result of history, not of “mission,” that parts of it survived at
all. “Community” and “mission” are not, as a matter of course, notions
complementary to religion. Zoroastrism has been introduced by a gov
ernmental act, the “frasastis through data.” The circle of Zoroaster, i.e,
the clan of Vistaspa with his officials and clients—Yr.13 enumerates 240
names—came into power after the convulsion of the Gomata episode,
and raised Zoroaster’s ethical and political ideas, his monotheism and
dualism, to the position which one can call a religion of the rulers. The
two hundred years of peace of the empire are the reason that Zoroaster’s
thoughts, passing over into Judaism and thence into Christianity, acted
upon human thought and thus on the course of universal history.
Not Zoroaster was “Religionspolitiker und Synkretist”—or everything
i^For frasasta>51 in the song of the caravan to UU, see under ’Post and Trasels.’ It is not

HOUSE HAUGAVA 175
would long since be forgotten—but the old cults, threatened by the turn
history took, adapted themselves, by syncretism, to the new situation
and thus became fit for reintroduction. Thenceforth, not before Arta
xerxes II, Zoroaster’s name is only the sign-board for the older religion
which had absorbed a certain number of his thoughts. There has never
been a “mission,” and the profanum vulgus has never been Zoroastrian
in the very meaning of the word.



X. HVARNAH
Hvasnah is a mythical notion common to all Iranians, and the Zam
yasht 19 is in reality not a hymn to the Earth, but to the hvarnah. This
is a fire, a flame, not generated by man with flint and steel or by rub
bing wood. Other fire is called “bipi^wa, ^ripi^wa, twice-, thrice-fed,”
frapi^a “well-fed,” hamesag.pihan “continuously fed.” But the hvar
nah is “ahvartam, MP. a^varisnik, not needing food,” see the myth
of the fight for this hvarnah under ‘ApamNapat.’ It dwells in the
water of the ocean vurukrtam and is according to the Pahl. translation
“agrift, unseizable.” The conception is related to naphtha, the sources
of which come from the depths of the ocean, and as such it belongs
to ApamNapat. It is also related to the lightning, and as such it belongs
to Vrthragna.
A problem of dialectology adheres to the word hvarnah, indicated
by the two NP. forms xurrah and farr. The opinion, frequently uttered,
that farnah belonged to western, hvarnah to eastern dialects, is not sup
ported by observations.
The change hv > f occurs first, at determined time and place,
in the region of Komis and Gurgan, western Parthia, in the
n.pr. vefiya < Vevahviya in Y.51,12, see under ‘Vehviya’; the
time is the ist century a.d. The next instance is, about a.d. ioo,
the name of the god ctAPPO on the Kushan coins in Bactria. At
the modern phase of the language, f < hv appears only in the
isolated. Median dialect of Sivand near Persepolis. The MMed.
of the Turfan documents, on the contrary, has vx < vh < hv;
the Zaza and other Med.-Kurd. dialects have w < vh < hv.
Consequently, if the Assyrians note p = f in Old Median and
Old Parthian personal names, e.g. sitirparnu for 'ci^rahvarnah
(Parth.), the Neo-Babylonians equally p, e.g. dari.parnu for
Med. *darayat.hvarnah, the Greeks (f> in -ffiepvrjs, but Ctesias
in -/3epK9? that means chiefly in the group t.hv—one must
understand this transcription as the nearest approximation
these languages and scripts could reach to the real Median
sound which seems already to have been vh.^

HVASNAH 177
OP. cuneiform writes u+v®, because its character u is derived
from Akk.-El. hu," and because the script, which was not “in
vented” for the OP. dialect, offered no better means of express
ing the sound of their dialect. Where divergently f is written
instead of u+v®, e.g. in the n.pr. v* i d”" P r“ n® a = *vindat.hvar
nah, the Median sound is thereby rendered—^for the appearance
of a name in OP. inscriptions does not make the name Old
Persian—and probably also the Median spelling: the Medes
probably used their f for the sound vh < hv of their dialect as
nearest approximation offered by their script, which they too
had not “invented,” but, at the best, adapted.
In the dialects of the southeast, the problem is represented by
the name Arachosia. Ved. sarasvati, OP. harahvati is properly
the name of the river, mod. Hilmand. It appears also in a part
of Media at that time occupied by Persians, as araquttu, in
728 B.C., in the annals of TiglathPilesar. The Elam, notation in
the OP. inscriptions is har.ru.wa.ti.s or har.r.o.wa.ti.s, with
m/wa for hva, as in waracmiia for OP. hvarazmiya etc. BPahl.
raxvat seems to descend from the OP. form; NP.Arab. ruxaj,
ruxxaj has ux < ax'^ in Persian dialects, but the East Ir.
final palatal, as in Sogdian. The Akk. versions, on the other
hand, write a.ru.ha.at.ti with Med. psilosis, the Pap.El. hrvxty,
both after Med. *(h)aravhati with av > 5 ; also Gr. ’Apaxwcrta
comes from this form, with metathesis of a and 5 for reasons of
Greek euphony.
Beside “hetumant, rich in dikes,” which lives in the mod.
name Hilmand, the river had another surname “hvarnahvati,
rich in hvarnah.” The same epithet is given to the lake Kan
savya into which the river falls. Besides, at Alexander’s time
another of the rivers falling into this lake bore the name
^apvaK&TL'?, i.e. hvarnahvati, with Greek compensated aspira
vni,27f., n.50, cf. Mesop.Origins 92, quotes, from K.4675, the placename Hu.al.su.un.di (to be sought in Shahrzur) and compares it with parsindu in .Vssurnasirpal Annals a° 4 (Luckenbill
b 455 )) situated in Zamua, i.e. Shahrzur. At first I believed this to be evidence for simultaneous rendering of Ir. hvar- by par- and hual-; but the year 4 of .Assurnasirpal 880 b.c. is too early
for an Iranian name to appear in that region. ^ "^^^refore, aspiration is neser written before u; opposite: i is never written after OP h^,
because this is derived from Akk.-El. hi. Equally: Ir. without added i can represent ci,
because c^ < 2 i < Akk.El.si.

spelling. The annals of TiglathPileser I mention parnuatti <

In the “Song to the Sosyant” (see under ‘Last Judgment’) the three
saviours come, at the resurrection, from the Kansavya, i.e. the Hamun
in Sistan, from which rises the Kuh i Khwadja, old mount Usidam.
Nyberg says in his polemics against my opinion that Zoroaster so
journed on the hill in the lake, 304f.: “Der xvarnah Kult hat offenbar
zwei Brennpunkte gehabt, einerseits voller Kontakt mit dem Vuru
kasa-Kreise”—i.e. vurukrtam, in fact the ocean—“andrerseits mit dem
Bewasserungsgebiet des Hetumant verbunden, dem in ungewohn
lichem Masse xvarnah-Kraft eignete, ohne Zweifel deswegen, weil eine
bedeutende Dynastie an seinen Ufern geherrscht hatte.^ Die Lokali
sierung der zoroastrischen Eschatologie daselbst ist nur ein Ausdruck
des Strebens nach einer Zoroastrisierung des machtigen xvarnah Kultes,
der diesem Fluss und dem See zugehort. . . . Sie ist also sekundar und
fiir die Geschichte der zoroastrischen Eschatologie fast ohne Interesse.”
I cannot see how anything as completely unknown and unintelligible
as “hvarnah power” could be “without doubt” the quality “in uncom
mon degree” of a river, because a dynasty as “unseizable” as the hvarnah
itself had ruled at its banks. This elusive and illusive dynasty and its
elliptic cult has left no trace in history and would have disappeared
like circles in water. The “Song to the Sosyant,” “almost without in
terest for Zoroastrian eschatology” is, on the other hand, the only place
where the Awesta touches this subject. Though not directly related to
the hvarnah, it is interpolated in the parts of the Zam yasht that speak
of hvarnah, seemingly because the detailed description of the “Sea
land” on the Kansavya had also found a place in this yasht. The concep
tion is abstracted from Gatha passages like Y.43,5:30,9, which the song
elaborates, adding the placename. There is no reason to expect the
return of a prophet from a precise spot, unless it be that he actually
sojourned there. The Sealand, therefore, is the sole, primary and gen
uine place of this eschatology. If, then, the waters of this region are

HVARNAH 179
called hvarnahvant, it is not because a “dynasty” with a mighty hvar
nah-cult dominated these waters which owned hvarnah power in un
common degree, but because the “belief” was dominant that the “vic
torious, hvarnahvant saviour” would appear from there.
The notion “hvarnah” (see under ‘Fravarti’ and ‘Tistriya’) is diflS
cult to define. The Pahl. translation of hvarnahvant, grouped with
revant as surname of the river, is “I’y’wmnd GDn’wmnd,” strikingly
explained by “xvysk’r v tv^s’k mynvg sgst’n, the dutiful and indus
trious genius (in or of) Sigistan.” In Hellenistic style one would say
“tyche of Sistan.”
Besides the mythical signification, the “victory-bringing hvarnah”
must have one of daily use, evidenced by a few Gathic and Awestic
expressions, like e.g. istois hvarna, which Zoroaster uses of Zamaspa
who helped him who was destitute as an exile.

because it was considered as a synonym as far back as the high Achae

king, a custom foreign to Greek, which must come from Iran. In the
/SaariKiKov opKO^ of the Iranian kings of Pontus, it is tvxw ySacrtXe&j?

martyrium of St. Pethion, G. Hoffmann, Syr.Akt., the grand-mobad
swears “by the gadda (i.e. hvarnah) of Hormizd and his crown!”

Long before that time, the god (f)dppo on the Kushan coins since
Kanishka holds as his emblem a bag of money in his hand: fortuna,
in West and East Iran, meant money. Already in the Awesta, in many
cases, hvarnah means “luck, tyche, fortune,” going over into “riches.”
The antonym, too, duLhvarnah, means—with the imprecative conno
tation of such terms—“he whose tyche may be bad,” Sucrrv;^?;?, as early
as in yi.io,io8. The duLhvarnah is “aHta, a proscriptus,” see under
‘Mithra.’ In groups of words like puru.hvarnah puru.gav puru.nar,
together with isti puru.hva^ra, the transition into “wealth” is com
pleted; equally in Yt.iS,!, where the “hvarnah of the Aryans” is called
puru.van^wam “consisting in many herds” and simultaneously puru.
istam.
Out of regard to the myth of the fight for the hvarnah, puru.istam
is usually translated by “von vielen begehrt”—Duchesne §117: “desire
de beaucoup” or “beaucoup desire”—attaching it to Vis-; only Lommel
translates “besitzreich” : like isa, anisa it belongs to Vis-, ista “to have
power over possessions.” The possession of cattle, men etc. is “hvarnah,
wealth.” isti, deriv. of ika, is “fortune, riches,” Skr. translation laksmih,
Pahl. comment, xvastak. Xvastak serves also as translation of “seta, pos
sessions, money” in Y/. 13,67:
ya^a na taxmo ra^esta hushambartat haca setat patiynita
“as a swift warrior fights for his well-gathered (viz. in barns) prop
erty.” It is the ra^esta who fights for his “hereditary” property, because
he is the xvastakdar, Armen, xostakdar “heir.”
For ham.brta cf. Fzi.3,27: ham.br^wa, f., with yavahya “harvest of
grain”; ham.brti “gathering.” Yr.6,i: “tat hvarno hambarayanti, a hun
dred thousand yazata (= elsewhere 99 999 fravarti) gather this hvarnah
(water generated by light of the sun) and distribute it over the earth
(as rain).” And Y^.io,52:



HV'ARNAH l8l

ni his dasva gara.nmane lay it down in the store
house (of heaven)
These verses prove that ham.baraya, <rvjji(popevco, not ham + V‘par-,
is the stem of MP. hanbar, anbar; at the same time, that gara.nmana
means “store-house,” not “house of praise” or “Haus der Glut,” and that
it belongs to V gar-, dyeipo), dyopdJ"
In other passages, seta, Pahl. transl. ;^vastak, means simply “money,”
e.g. “When people are seta.cinah, claiming money, one shall
collect money, ham iSa setam hambarayan.” In this way anbar becomes
“capital” and sut “interest.”
Gold and silver were of old the scale of value, although the wealth of
a xsa^riya was figured in men and cattle, horses and cows he owned,
and although an old tariff for surgeons still demands payment in pecus,
not in pecunia. During the second half of the 6th century b.c., dinars
of Croesus were current, which may have been actually coined after
the foreign model in Iran, whilst the proper Iranian coinage began only
under the reign of Darius. The fact that the Awesta is silent about
coined money—emphasized by W. Geiger, who in 1884 believed the
whole Awesta to be prehistoric—says nothing: the oldest parts are
slightly older, all the rest younger than the coinage.
NP. pul “money” is Aw. pr^a, to Vpar- “to equalize,” cf. Pahl.Vid.
5,19 under ‘Sea’; the MP. verb puhlistan, puhlenitan means “to bal
ance, compensate.” MP. puhl is translation of Aw. api.paramnai “to
balance,” a.prti “compensation” etc. The redeeming of penalties by
payments in kind, later in money, causes the change of meaning, but
from which moment on the “payment” w'as made in coined money,
is indiscernible.
MP. xvastak is always wrongly explained as belonging to “xvastan,
want to have,” money because everybody wants it. There was once a
revolt in Teheran, and an unconcerned policeman answered to the ques
tion “what is going on?” laconically: “pul mixahand! they want

money.” x^astak is OP. *hva.ista. Aw. hvo.istesva pasusva in iVzV.58
“self (-acquired) possession and small-cattle (pecunia).”® hvo is the
pron.refl. hva, spelled with 6 as in hvo.awisak, to be registered under
Duchesne §205 instead of §47. Bartholomae assumed the same formation
for ^wa.isti “thine-property,” which is not a true compound; on the
other hand, the Manichaean term xvaki, whether <*hva.iki or *hva.
axsti, belongs to it.
In Gathic, too, hvarnah and isti have the same meaning. In Y.29,9,
the “soul of the ox” complains at having found in Zoroaster—the only
one who cares—only a nar asura, aKvpo? [here expressly called “Spi
tama,” to indicate that, though being a member of that rich family, as
fugitive he is destitute], and what it needs is an ik.xsa^riya, a xsa^riya
with wealth. The opposition to nar asura seems to indicate that xsa^riya
is used in its connotation nar = ra0esta, but it may belong to Vxs^ri''
Xsa^ram “hospitium,” whether isa.xsa^riya be a derivative of isa.
Xsa^ra, or a compound of isa + xsa^nya." Zoroaster says, Y.46,2: “I
know that I am powerless, an.isa,” because, as an exile, kamnafsva
kamnara, “accompanied by only a few herds and men,” he is poor.
Y.46,3: “When will come he who makes rise the light of day.? I trust
Thou wilt for me perfect my work!” The soul of the ox says: “When
will come he who will lend me [Zoroaster speaking] zastavat avo, a
helping hand.” Bartholomae refers for zastavant to Germ. “Hand und
Fuss haben” i.e. to be practical, zastavant can be “handy, practical” or
“open-handed.” Zoroaster wants to have something “in hand,” namely
money. The Pahl. transl. understands the sentence rightly as referring
to Zoroaster, not, as modern translations do, to the soul of the ox, and
renders zastavat by “pa.tovan, cf. NP. tavangar, rich.” “To give a hand”
is everywhere the figure for help, cf. Mir.Man.m,^^,i2, Narisaf hymn:
“ ’vmn hvfry’d’ ’vm vxd dstd’r bv’h, help us and lead me by the hand!”
The fugitive Zoroaster finds the wealthy man in the Haugava

and tarif “nevvly acquired possessions.” Wh. has erroneously +hv5ista “der hochste, erste";

of this second clause.
" The Aw. spelling a5 sa rests only on ’y, equally for i-. isa.xsaflra in yr.1,13 is the same

HVASNAH 183
2amaspa; that is why he calls him in Y.15,18 “istois hvarna, fortunate
(blessed) with riches.” Both words have this material sense when single,
and the more so when united. Zoroaster never uses the subst. hvarnah,
the mythical notion of which belongs to the ahura Vrthragna and
Mithra, any more than he uses mi^radrux* and similar words; but he
does not hesitate to use the trivial adj. “fortunate, rich.” ¥^.5,98 para
phrases the Zoroastrian expression: “istim JaSyanta hougava, for riches
asked the Haugava,” and the later legend retains the historical concep
tion of the wealth of that family, scarcely without influence upon the
marriage of Artaxerxes I and Damaspia, nee Zamaspi.
Nyberg (245), on the contrary, remarks to Y.51,18: “Ausserordentlich
aufschlussreich ist der Ausdruck ‘der Besitz als sein xvarna gewann,
istois xvarna,’ das letzte wort adj., ‘xvarnah-besitzend, mit xvarnah
versehen hinsichtlich isti’; isti, eigentlich ‘Besitz,’ steht hier pragnant
fiir ‘Besitz des Vohu manah.’ Der hochste Ehrentitel der Zarathustra
Gemeinde war es, Vohumanah empfangen zu haben; der Ehrentitel
‘mit xvarnah versehen’ wiederum war der hochste in der Mithra
Gemeinde. Hier werden beide verkoppelt: wir konnen hier den Syn
kretismus zwischen Gatha-Religion und Mithra-Religion mit Handen
greifen.” When reading these sentences printed in spaced type nobody
would surmise that the two honorific titles of the two communities
and all the conclusions are nothing but a fantastic interpretation of the
harmless hapax “istois blessed with riches.” The theory serves
to support another one, of “Zoroaster’s poverty,” 194!?.: “Zarathustra
ist nicht gerade ein besitzloser Proletarier”—a proles with the double
gentilic spitama hecataspana—“aber er gehort zu einer Gruppe
bestimmten religiosen Charakters, gekennzeichnet dadurch, dass sie
kein Eigentum im gleichen Sinne wie die iibrigen Stammesmitglieder
besass. Also nach allem zu urteilen, eine sakrale Armut.”
While he thus makes Zoroaster Spitama a darwish, Ctesias makes
Spitakes Spitama “satrap of the Derbissoi, the Darwishs.” darwes
comes from Aw. drigu, gen. drigos; the MP. form is, according to the
inscriptions, not daryos, but drgvs, same as in Wais u Ramin: daryos.
Lommel translates drigu by “landfliichtig,” one who flees into a foreign
land, or MHG. elent (to “ausland”). Elend means poor, but poor does
not mean elend, landfliichtig.



HVARNAH

Y.10,13:
namo homai yat krnoti footfall to Homa who makes

Or Y.57,10:
Sroso Srosa
yo driyosca drivayasca who puts together a house
amavat nmanam hamtasti amavat for the poor man and
woman, when the sun has set.
Lommel: “der den landfliichtigen ein machtiges Haus hinstellt.”
Bartholomae has also the “machtige Haus.” In these verses, Sroso, as
home police, takes care of the night shelter of homeless people, amavat
may mean “solid,” better—with want of tasbih—“adequate, fit,” at any
rate “solid enough for the purpose,” hence rather “modest” than
“machtig.”
Nyberg continues: “In der Gatha (Y.44,18-19) erwartet Zarathustra
als Lohn zehn tragende Stuten und ein Kamel. Man bemerke, dass es
das Luxustier ist, nicht die Kuh wie in Indien . . . , wahrend der Besitz
des Stammes in Rindvieh bestand.” What could a man who denies per
sonal property for religious reasons do with such a stable that requires
care and fodder.? This price for one song still means 20 horses in the
same year, enough for six cowboys, corresponding to work for a ranch
of considerable value even today, much more than the 12,000 dirham
which Vuzurgmihr got from Xusrau for his chess playing. Firdausi
expected from Mahmud 100,000 gold dinars—much, but little in com
parison with the noble prices the caliphs paid their poets per line. Such
numbers reflect the permanent inflation of all money, and we do not
know how many songs Zoroaster produced in a year. In Teheran lived
a Qadjar prince, who composed panegyrics on all who arrived or de
parted, including myself, and lived upon this kind of royalty.
About the “Luxustier” there are many wrong notions. Bartholomae
translated Yr.17,13: “Ihre Kamele [of the men whom Ardvi hacati]
erregen Schrecken”; Lommel, doubtful: “bay anti, klarlich ‘erregen
Furcht’; ebenso in Y/.i7,i2 von den Pferden gesagt.” The following
verse has: “ustraho . . . uzayanto zmat prtamna vaSryavo”; Bartholo



HVARNAH 185
mae : “Die Kamele die vom Boden sich (auf den Hinterbeinen) aufrich
tend miteinander kampfen, wenn sie briinstig sind”—that, indeed,
would be a horrifying sight. Lommel: “ein Kampf zwischen Kamels
hengsten oder ein Verbalten im Dienst des Menschen.?” Bartholomae’s
words in brackets are contrary to the anatomy of camels. They raise
themselves awkwardly to their four legs, and do not fight with their
soft feet, but bite only; they lie, even in heat.® They look conceited and
scornful, as the Arabs say, because to them alone the thousandth name
of Allah is revealed, but maybe because their ambition to be a Luxustier
is not satisfied. Their temperament is better than their looks. Once, in
spring, when the whole valley was full of camel foals, I had a visit at
Persepolis from a friend who did not quite dare, as he would have
loved to do, to photograph the foals from nearby against the outspoken
displeasure of their mothers. He left for Isfahan, and my Turkish chauf
feur reported on the trip: “He is a good man!—^Yes.—He is a pious
man!—Yes.—He fears God.—Yes.—But I never before saw a man who
fears a camel!”
Nyberg, 240, to y.46,18-19: “Wer fiir den Sieg des Guten in dieser
Welt wirkt, wird nach dem Erdendasein als Lohn alles das gewinnen,
was die Ekstase zu bieten vermag, und ausserdem vollen Besitz der
Seele des Stieres selber—wahrlich, eine strahlende Aussicht fiir einen
Hirten!” I doubt it. The full ownership would, for all that, be shared by
the souls of all the generations since Adam-Gayamart. The many
shepherds I have seen were interested in milk, and would prefer two
cows with calf in hand to the soul of the ox in the bush. Zoroaster
thought the same, for in Y.46,19 he promises, besides the reward of
future life, not at all the soul of the ox, but “on the spot a pair of cows
with calf.” If that was his “Missionspraxis,” he or the one who financed
him, Zamaspa, must have had—as they probably had—thousands of
cows and luxury camels. And when “his most ardent wishes” accom
pany Zamaspa and Frasaukra on their journey to “where Rtam should
rule and AhuraMazdah should abide in abundance,” whence he hopes
to obtain the “frasastis”—then he doctus mantus represented at the
same time considerable financial interests. For, the revocation of the
banishment reinstates Zoroaster into his possessions, cf. Beh. §14. And

the Spitama owned large estates in Rhagiane. The wealthy people o£
that time had their money administered by non-Aryan suftidrnga, like
Murasu Sons in Nippur, the greatest banking firm of the period, and
that is why the family name of the Spitama appears in their business
papers.
Even as an exile, Zoroaster had enough money to pay his traveling,
500 miles, in a two-horse team, with attendants, from Raga via Komis
to Tosa, whether in a hired coach or his own. There was never a dar
wish who traveled with attendants in his own or a hired car.



XI. BANDVA AND GRAHMA
In the obscure background of Zoroaster’s life—in the most passionate
of his verses—two hostile figures appear whom he calls “my bandva
and his tkesa” in Y.49,1-2, and “the kavi and the karpan grahma” in
Y.32, 12-14. No investigation has so far thrown the faintest light on these
figures, and yet the tone of the stanzas, the allusions they contain to
Y.46, “Gatha of the Flight,” and the allusions to those stanzas in Y.
53,8-9, show from the beginning that they are the node of all threads
of thought and that the poet speaks there of the decisive event of his
life. Without solving this riddle one cannot attain an understanding of
the gathas and of the life of Zoroaster.

ihm (eigen) sei, noch hat er sich mit dem Guten-Denken

Hertel, Beitraiy. “der ich die schlecht-leuchtenden-Frauen
(dusr^ris) durch das Licht-des-Heils zu erfreuen suchte,” com
ment: “schlecht-leuchtend heisst ‘die ein schlechtes Erkenntnis
Licht, daena, in sich tragen, also noch der daevischen Lehre
anhangen.” He concludes: “Zarathustra suchte zunachst auf
die Frauen einzuwirken, bei denen sein Bestreben, . . . Vieh
schlachtereien ein Ende zu bereiten, auf besseres Verstandnis
rechnen konnte.”
Nyberg, in: “Bandva’s Irrlehrer ist aufruhrerisch gegen
Asa und kummert sich nicht darum, ob Armaiti ihm zuge
hdren wbd.” 192: “Wichtiger ist [what precedes sounds ‘un
wichtig’ indeed] dass bei Bandva ein tkaesa lebt, der sich nicht
darum bemiiht, mit der wirksamen Armaiti Verbindung zu
suchen, und sich nicht mit Vohumanah berat, d.h. sich iiber die
ekstatischen Cbungen und den normalen Verkehr des Stammes
mit der Gottheit hinwegsetzt.”
This is an amazing picture of a rabbi, an old renegade who
delights bad women by the light-of-salvation, is too lazy to go
to the maga for ecstatic exercises, spiritist seances or whatever
the “normal intercourse” with the deity may mean, and waits
inactively and is in the way.
The verses say in reality
:
“And once, my brother-in-law will be forfeited to the law, the prin
ceps, he who listened to (those that passed) the miscarried sentence.
O Mazdah, come as Rtam with Thy just punishment, be true to me!
Find, as Vahumano, his death!”
“Then, my brother-in-law’s drug-ish judge still remains, who in two
ways injures Rtam: neither does he confirm ‘Holy Armatis, be mine!’,
nor does he judge by Vahumano.”
Meillet considered the gathas to be among the most difficult products
of IE. literature, and every word of the translation requires long study
and commentary.



BANDVA AND GRAHMA
pafre: Wb. “Perf. v. V°par- ‘obstare.’ ” Andreas-Lommel : “zu
V^par-.” Bartholomae divided the root in V^par-, represented
by the part.pres. paramna “Busse thuend” (better; atoning for)
;
V^par-, represented by pass, pryati, -te, only with “tanum, ’
besides fra.prnoti in Afrln., fra.pryati in Fz^.5,9; the p.p.p.
prta, used with ci^a = Gr. tisis, and aprti “making equal (balanc
ing), atonement by corporal punishment”; further by Gath,
pr^a “atonement”; an.apr^a “unatonable”; prta.sara /‘having
forfeited one’s life (head)”; finally V^’par-. the alleged ob
stare.” “Je m’obstacle”: the three \''par- are one and the same
word “to make even, par, to atone.” To it belongs NP. pul
“money” as atonement for blood-guiltiness by disbursements in
kind or money. The perf. pafre, hence, means “he is forfeited to
the law,” just as prta.tanu in Y.53)9- The OIr. perfect has more
than once the sense of the Lat. fut. exactum, Gr. fut.III, here
made plain by yava, according to Wb. “zu yav- ‘Dauer, dat.
yavoi ‘for ever’ ”; adv. instr. yava “zu irgend einer Zeit = iemals,
einmal.” Only in Y.49,1 Bartholomae gives it the meaning “zu
jeder Zeit, immer.” yava pafre signifies “once (fut.) he will be
forfeited to the law.”
maziko; Nyberg, 191: “Wahrscheinlich ein technischer Aus
druck.” There are two old analogies, (i) In Behistun the chiefs
of the royal and of the rebellious troops are called ma^ista,
equivalent to the OP. military title frataraka in the Pap.El.
These are commanders of a thousand, OP. hazahrapati, a sort
of magistri equitum or pagi. (2) In Xerx.Pers.har. ma^ika, viz.
of the sons of the king, means “princeps, heir, successor to the
throne.” The word goes on to be used as designation of rank.
The Megistanes of the Arsacid period are a rank at the court,
the table companions of the king. On the Papyrus 5 (Hansen)
a mhstk’n mhstk’ of Alexandreia is mentioned ; al-Mundhir of
Hira received the honorific Ram-afzud-Yazdegird and became
mahist, Arab. a‘zam.^
^ For megistanes cf. Th. Mommsen, Rom.Gesch, v,343f. In Assyrian, “mar sarri rabu, the great kmg’s-son” means successor to the throne, Cf. H. Wincklcr, Ahor.Forschg. ii,239f- on
Hebr. “kablr, princeps.” The rank of the vazurkan, ideogr. rb’, is rendered m Arabic by ‘uzamah



190 BANDVA AND GRAHMA
dulr^ris: Andreas conjectured 'duLr^is “denen es schlecht
geht”; Bartholomae: “Unsicher. Acc.pl.m. ‘unter iibler Obhut
stehend, in religiosen Dingen verwahrlost’ ; Komp. v. dus +
^hr^ri, weil vor r^ri duz- zu erwarten ware; hr^ri = har^ra, un
gewbhnliche Bildung.” In this way, it would mean in Zoroas
ter’s didactic style: “the bandva listens to those who are under
his evil charge” and would make sense. But the reasons for this
change are untenable: Gathic has also rs.vacah against rz.uxSa,
and dusiti—both with s—against Aw. duzita, Gr. Svo-ySaTo?.
Such phonetic detail is not authentic. Bartholomae says “un
usual formation,” because -r^ri would be the fern, of a noun-of
agent. Therefore Hertel translates “Frauen.” Duchesne places
dulr^ri behind niLhar^ri “surveillante,” but translates, like
W^. “sous mauvaise garde,” not “gardienne.” One must class it
with awi.mi^ri, Duchesne §25, with i-sufhx. The following
verses speak of things judicial and thereto dusr^ri belongs, that
means to V^ar- “adjudge,” mostly with “rti, lot, destiny,” also
with zasta.ista = Ind. mudra, gestures of the lord justiciary, and
w'ith “sava, reward and punishment.”" The acc.pl. dus.r^ris
signifies either “the miscarriage of justice” or “those who
passed a miscarriage of justice.”
’’cixsnuso: participle of the desid. stem of xsnu- “to hear,”
written cixsnusa, at the other places cixsnuso. Bartholomae
took it (with -a) as i.pers.sg.; Andreas, too, translated it as a
first person, but remarks: “dieselbe form y.45,9 cixsnuso (mit
V fur ’ ) geschrieben,” and to y.45,9: “Form und Endung wie
vivaraso in 45,8.” Also like mimayzo in 45,10. It is the same
participle everywhere, for, against the previous translations, it
refers to the preceding, not the following words, and there the
ist pers. is not possible. Vx^nu- does not mean “zufrieden stel
len” (see under ‘Hospitium’), and cixsnuso not “zu Gefallen
sein,” but at all places “to listen, to lend one’s ear to,” in 49,1,
thereby violating the obligation, founded on rtam, to give, as
bandva, protection to Zoroaster. Likewise in the Yama myth,
y.32,19: “Who listened to men,” breaking the food taboo, see
= To the same root: ‘‘arto, plaintiff, or legal contest"; “arffra, trial, causa," and Gath, rfiwa n y.46,13.

under ‘Yama.’ At the third place, end of the “Gatha of the
Vision,” 43,15: “never, noit porus,^ must one listen to the drug
vant”; Bartholomae’s “nicht soil man immer wieder, parus, dem
Druggenossen zu gefallen sein” is as wrong as Lommel’s “nicht
soli man den vielen Liignern gefallig sein, denn diese bezeich
nen alle Wahrhaftigen als hose!” In y.45,8, finally, “winning
over, avivrso, wdth songs of praise” and “listening to him,”
without the connotation “to something forbidden.”
vahvi ada: “the good, i.e. the just punishment, penalty,” in
parallel with frasta in 2,d; cf. OP. hufrastam aprsam “I have
punished gocxl i.e. justly.”
a moi rapa: Vrap-, similar to Vhak-, cf. under ‘Social Struc
ture,’ expresses, like ahma.rafna in Y.HafL^o,^, the mutual
allegiance between liege lord and vassals. The thought is that
of Pmah ‘azabtani in positive form.
oso vida: “find for him death!”, to Vvid-, vind-; as with
Assurbanipal : “I, Ikar, mitutu Ahseri eppus, will achieve the
death of A.,” who then is murdered.
rtat raraso: The archetype had no notation at all for the Aw.
vowel a. Bartholomae, Grdr. and Wb., attached raraso as an
a-participle of a redupl. intens.pres., and rarasya as redupl.
ia-pres. to a V rah-; no etymology, “abfallen, abtrunnig werden”
probably because the verb is always connected with an ablative.
Andreas read, in Y.32,11, rarusyon, and translated “die sich
abwenden.” The Pahl. transl. has always res-, hence regarded
both forms as redupl. pres, of Vris-, against which there is no
formal objection, but the ablative is disturbing.
The following word dorak supplies a clue to the signification.
Wb. and Grdr. regard this as an s-aor. of \''dar- “to hold,
have,” with acc. and negation, “sich nicht sorgen um: non
sacram curavit sibi esse armatim.” Even less satisfying is the
explanation of the identical word, written darast in Y.43,13

Pahl. transl. is nikezitan “to give one’s approval.” One must

nikezitan), to Vdarz- “to fix, establish,” and Y.19,13 “tkesam
adranjayati, he lays down the (third) tenet”; y.48,7: didryza
(both in Wb. under V drang-), finally Aw. handraxta, MP.
andraxt “made fast, confirmed, sealed,” with OP. handunga.
Like Gath, darsat, OP. darsam, “firme, fortiter,” this dorak
belongs to the s-aor. darz- of Vdarz-, 01. drrnhati “firmat.”
The sentence expressly states that the tkesa has not confirmed
the formula of the Zoroastrian creed “Armatis be mine!”, as the
following verses specify. The next stanza contains the whole
Zoroastrian credo. The construction, with spantam armatim in
the acc., as in Y.29,7 azutois man^ram, shows that the short
sentence is a quotation. Not having confirmed the tenet, the
tkesa is no “renegade,” and raraso cannot mean “abgefallen
von,” but means certainly more than “sich abwenden von.” The
real meaning must come close to zitarta in Y.53,9, “diminishing
the rtam,” for in the next stanza 49,3—see under ‘Armatis’

rtat raraso is followed by the other formula of the Zoroastrian
creed; “rtam sudyai, rasayahe druxs, rtam augendum, delen
dam esse druxs”—like rasayahe drugvantam, savayo rtavanam
in Y.51,9—and what the tkesa does is just the contrary. There
fore, raraso must be attached to the root, put down in Wb. as
Vras- “schadigen, damage, impair,” of which only the just
mentioned inf. rasayahe and the noun rasah are safely attested.^
The close semantic relation to V ris- “suffer injury” explains the
Pahl. transl. res-. Vras- is the antonym of 'Vsu-, and if this,
according to Bailey’s study, is a “miracle power producing
prosperity,” then ras-, is a “bad power producing injury,”
corresponding to Gath. Vjya-, whence zitarta (see under ‘Hau
gava’). Bartholomae refers for Vras-, against Kretschmer, to
01 . raksas and Gr. ipix^o), whereas Hertel Beitr. connects it
with ranxsayan^ya in Yr. 10,27^ “the countries offending against
Mithra.” In Siegesf. 143, to RV. iv,4, he emphasizes that Veda and
Awesta both call the powers hostile to the own gods raksas etc.
* See the pres. rasa\.t in Y.io,2i under ‘Mithra,’ in the gloss inserted into a magic charm for mvulnerabilits, where Bartholomae remarks “one would exiiect short a’’: “though (the lance) hits the body, atcit dim noit raJayante, they do not wound him.” ^ The places >7.10,78 and y.12,4 arc unreliable.



BANDVA AND GRAHMA 193
This remark is rather compelling to connect the words belong
ing to Vras- with ran^sayant and Ved. raksas. ranxsayant has
the form of a verb.denom.; cf. Henning’s attempt to elucidate
Vra(n)j —in zii,ix,i99.
manaya: caus. of Vman-, means, as in Old Persian, nothing
but “to remain,” viz. to be left over, to survive the bandva,
whose death is hoped for or foreseen, pafre “he is forfeited” and
manayati “he survives” are the logical opposites.
dbita: means “twofold”—as in OP. dvitaparnam—^not “long
since,” and is specified by the two lines with noit and neda.
frasta does not mean “sich beraten, take counsel, confer,” but
is the juridical term “to ask, inquire = to sentence,” cf. under
‘Last Judgment.’
Nobody translates bandva. Bartholomae saw a proper name in it;
Andreas, as Geldner before him, an appellative “zu Aind. bandhu,
Verband, Genossenschaft, Kultgemeinschaft.” Lommel remarks: “Fur
das Verstandnis kaum ein Gewinn. An die Sippengenossen, mit denen
sich Zarathustra nach Y.46,1 zeitweilig in Zerwiirfnis befand, kann
nicht gedacht werden, ihnen hatte er nicht den Tod angewiinscht.”
For no other reason than the sentimentality of a fanciful image he
misses the point on which the whole understanding depends.—Under
‘Kavi’ we have touched the subject: bandva must be a term of relation
ship, because Zoroaster raises the special accusation against the ahura,
lord justiciary, that he failed, though being his bandva, to protect him
against the verdict of the hostile court, that means to have been disloyal
to his duty as relative, oso vida “find death for him!” can be said only
of a definite person. Geldner-Andreas’ identification with OI. bandhu
is incontestable, only the German translation is not exact. It is indeed
a term of relationship, and corresponds to Gr. Trevdepos as term for
affinitas through women, a notion yet unknown to the original IE.
language. The men in question are hvetu and kavi, between which
connubium existed, bandva is a brother-by-marriage of Zoroaster, either
through his mother or a sister, hence approximately what modern lan
guages express by step-brother or brother-in-law.
Nyberg speaks frequently of “Bandva and his tkesa,” e.g. 243 “der

Gathic texts. “Judge” is the sole signification of tkesa everywhere: he

religiosem Gebiet, im Gath. spez. von der Lehre des falschen Glaubens,

right Pahl. transl. datastan. All follow, without an afterthought. To his
Gatha translation Bartholomae annotates: “tkaesa gehbrt also wie daeva
u.a. zu den Schlag- und Kampfwortern der zarathustrischen Zeit . . . ,
spater hat sich diese Bedeutung verwischt,” an unfounded bias obstruct
ing the understanding of the entire Awesta.
The words viciro ahuro in Y.294 show that the ahura, the lord jus
ticiary in whose name justice was administered, is also the one who
“decides,” namely the king who SiKa^ei; however, “vi-fici-, distinguere,
hiayvCivaC is the very activity of the judge, and the tkesa stands beside
the ahura as later the vizier beside the sultan.
With the words of Y.49,2 and 32,2 “Armatis, obedience to the law,
be mine!” the neophyte confirms by oath his adherence in the Fra
varani, Y.12,1. The six crimes he forswears at that occasion—two against
live, two against immobile possessions, two against body and life of the
Mazdayasnians—are “Six” instead of our “Ten Commandments.”®
Therefore the candidate for confirmation is “ahura.tkeso, one who
observes the commandments of Ahura,” formed after an older rta.tkesa
“he who observes the commandments of rtam” in Y/. 10,84. And purvya.
tkesa were the first that observed the commandments.
The kjtdb al-Aghdni tells 18,78: “al-Hadjdjadj b. Yusuf had the

BANDVA AND GRAHMA 195
choice between a good Christian and a bad Muslim teacher for his
young sons, and chose the Muslim saying: It is a repulsive thought to
give my sons to somebody who would not initiate them into the ‘law’
and the ‘doctrine’ of Islam.” That is what matters, tkesa is the shari‘a,
the “Ten Commandments” of Zoroaster. The Pahl. transl. explains its
datastan by pesemarih, and pasemarih, vicir u datwarih, all judicial
terms.
Further on in y.49,7-9, Zoroaster speaks of the frasastis which he
hopes to obtain through Zamaspa and Frasaustra as his emissary and
herald. The frasastis is the revocation, by the court of appeal, of the
dusr^ris, the miscarriage of justice, which the court, ar^ra, of his home
town had passed.
Y.46,1 (text under ‘Hospitium’)
“To which country, to hide myself, where, to hide myself, shall I go ?
They have cast me out from hvetu and aryaman; the vrzanahartar does
not listen to me, nor the drug-ish commanders of the province !”
These verses describe the court of the province: it is located in the
vrzana, the capital; Aram.Arab, madina “seat of the court” is the
Pahl. ideogr. for sahristan, provincial capital. Raga was the capital of
that part of Media. The court consists of nobles and clients, that is here
magi, of the consul civitatis, and of the military commanders of the
province. They do not listen to Zoroaster’s defense. But the verses do
not mention the judge who passed this sentence, nor the justiciary who
confirmed it to make it valid. The two are revealed only in Y.49. The
sentence was outcasting from hvetu and aryaman, hence loss of all civil
rights, proscription. We shall soon discover what the indictment was. A
lord justiciary, ahura, is a man risen from the military nobility, ra^esta,
satraps and kings. Therefore this ahura is called one of the “kavitat”
in Y.32,12-15 (see under ‘Vehviya’), he is kavi. His attribute mazista,
“the greatest” in Y.49,1, makes him an “ahura mazista, successor to the
throne.” In Y.49, Zoroaster calls him “my bandva.”
Zoroaster’s style is never descriptive, always explanatory, argumenta
tive: By listening to the wrong sentence, dusr^ris of the court, the
ahura himself becomes guilty, pafre. As bandva he injures, in doing so,
the rtam, which demands that he protect his relative; thus he becomes
himself a “sacrilegus,” like a next-of-kin murderer, and therefore Rtam



BANDVA AND GRAHMA
196
must come as injured moral law, and Vahumano as Justitia to punish
him. And even when vengeance would strike him, the mobaS remains
who is doubly sacrilegious, because, himseh a judge, he neither observes
the law himself, nor judges conscientiously. Thereby he impairs rtam,
becomes rtat rariso, i.e. zitarta, and has deserved death, for the com
mandment is: “rtam sudyai, Rtam must be increased!”
Therefore the “Gatha of the Flight,” Y.46y4, says:
yas.tam ^sa^rat mazda moi^at jyatos va
ho tan froga pa^man hucistois carat
“he who deprives him of his rule and life, prepares as leader the path
of good-knowledge (cistis = religion).”
For the style cf. Y.53,9: yo is jyatos hami^yat vaso.itoisca, and Beh.
§13: hya avam . . . xsa^ram ditam caxriya. The drugvant to whom
the words refer is the judge who passed the sentence. In the following
stanza Zoroaster asks protection from “murderous deeds,” because, as a
proscript, he is threatened by murder.
Y.32 describes how at the same time his relatives and adherents are
persecuted, st.ii:
te.cit ma mrndan jyotum yoi drugvanto mazbis cikoitrs
ahvisca ahuvasca apayati rexnaho vedam
Andreas : “Alle die zernichten das Leben, die bedacht sind, die Haus
frauen und Hausherren um den Besitz ihres Erbes zu bringen. . . .”
Hertel, “. . . die Fiirstinnen und Fiirsten an der AufSndung
des Erbes zu hindern.”
jyotu is not /3tos “life,” but /Siotos “livelihood,” which requires regu
lar succession, veda, to Vvid-, vindatan, is the “falling-in,” not the
possessing or finding of the heritage. What is done is confiscation of the
inherited estate of the lords and ladies. The maltreated and dispos
sessed ones are Zoroaster’s relatives. The similar expression arjis narpis
in Y.53>9j refers to the disinherited notaryaho.—Proscriptions and
confiscations were the method of Gomata; therefore Darius says in Beh.
§14. I restored to the nobility their vassals, and their clan and family
possessions to the vi^, of which Gomata the magus had deprived them.”

to capture himself, the man^ran of AhuraMazdah. In 14 they are
called grahmo kavayascit; in 13, a grahmo is the one who hisast; there
by the word is defined as designing an individual person, just as the
words “oso vida” define bandva. In 15, the abstr. nouns karpatat and
kavitat resume the two subjects grahmo and kavayo of 14. This connec
tion of grahma and karpan suggests the same in i2,c: grahma must
determine karpa.
The Pahl. transl. is, as always, a word by word rendering, without
construction
:
yais grahma rtat varta karpa isnam druiam aveban grahmak ac ahrakih dosaktar kc karp hcnd u x^'^tadih x^'^hend pa drozisn
By itself, one would probably interpret the Pahl. sentence as “by those
who are karp, grahmak is more beloved than Rtam, and they want to
rule by committing crimes,” but that would not be a normal Pahl.
expression of the idea, and it contradicts the Aw. text which has; “by
them the karpan is preferred to Rtam, as is the xsa^ram etc.” There
fore, only the vocable grahmak or gramak is of value.
Withdrawing an older proposal, Bartholomae remarked in
ZAir Wb. 221: “grahma, with Ar. s (meaning; not to Vvan-)”;
he took grahma in i2,c as n.pl. “G. and his adherents.” Andreas
Wackernagel; “grahma, in 12 neutr. man-Stamm, ‘Opferfrass’;
grahmo in 13, 14 < Ar. ‘grasma ‘Opferfresser.’ ” Hertel, Beitr.
218, disproved this meaning. I should not assume two stems for
a word which occurs only three times in such close connection
in these stanzas; grahmo is nom.sg.masc. of an adj., and grahma
instr.sg. (of quality) “the karpa is preferred as grahma.”
The origin of the word remains unknown, but it survives. Mah i
Frav. §1; “Why do men prefer the day Fravartin of the month Har
vatat to all others ?, pa mas u veh u gramiktar darend.” In Xusr. Ret.
§§82 and 91, gramikan is syn. of dostan. gramik, dost dastan is the same
idiom as the Pahl.transl. of Aw. “grahma—varta” by “gramak—dosak
tar.” NP. giram, with derivatives," means “earns, cherished, dear,” hence
“grahma = persona grata, favorite,” a sense which fits Y.32 perfectly;
the kavi and his favorite."
S X.pr. giramik.kirt, son of Zarer, in AyitkZar. §79ff. is Girami of Firdausi (Daqlqi). NP. giram, girami, giramisn, scmanucalU influenced by Arab, kiram. After this was written, Henning corrected, in jR.\s 1944, I39sn.2, the reading gr”g in



BANDVA AND GRAHMA 199
The plural“the kavis,” again intentionally undefined, means the person
of the bandva who is a kavi. He and his grahma scheme to throw
Zoroaster into chains, as was done to Smerdis by Cambyses. St. 15: “The
priesthood, karpatat, and the high nobility, kavitat [grahma belongs
to the first, bandva to the second] are sinners, . . . those whom they do
not allow to be masters of their lives, shall ascend to heaven!”, see
under ‘Kavi.’ Once more, intentionally undefined, the two abstracts
stand pro concreto—an idiom Zoroaster often uses. Here, in 32,14-15,
grahma is connected with the bandva just as in Y.49,1-2 the tkesa with
the bandva. And the persons, too, are the same, for, as y.46,1 contains
the sentence, excommunication from hvetu and aryaman, so this pas
sage that speaks of the peasantry, contains the indictment which led
to Zoroaster’s condemnation : he strives for a liberation of the peasantry
and is banished as a revolutionary and offender against religion. One
cannot help thinking of Socrates.
In Y.46,4, Zoroaster openly invites to a murder, either of the brother
in-law who confirmed, or of the judge who pronounced the sentence.
In Y.49,1, he foresees, in the near future, that fate will overtake the
brother-in-law, and that his favorite will follow him. The third phase
is the gatha Y.53,8-9:

MirMan.m, a 13, to gr’mg, corresponding to Sogd. 7rame. The MMed. text is: “like nomads who with their tents, horses and gr’mg move from place to place”; the Sogd. text: “(nothing can help you), neither treasure, 7zny, nor 7r’m-, neither hostel, ’sp’nch, nor palace nor a strong tower, etc.” This is clearly “cherished, treasured \aluables.” In the footnote Henning applies his translation “possessions” to Aw. grahma; 32,12 “the karpan preferred money, possessions to Right,” 32,13 “they shall get that wealth in hell,” and 32,14 “even the kavis had an e}e on his money,” (which would be Zoroaster’s mone\), mainly because “there is no reason to deviate from the Pahl. translation.” Though agreeing with several points of his deduction, I cannot accept the authority of the Pahl. translation, nor his translation of the passages; nor his assuming two neutr. stems grahma and grahmah.



200 BANDVA AND GRAHMA
To st.8: hu-xsa^ra, when connected with Vx^i- or opposed
to dus-xsa^ra or the notion of bad rule, means of course “who
is a good ruler.” In the epithet of the Amrta Spanta, hu- may
mean “co(rulership), fellow (-rulers).” The more so here, where
there is no talk of ruling and quality of rule, hu- seems to me to
be *hm-, as in huzantu, huyaxna, “he with (his) hu.xsa^ra,
fellow-xsa^riya.”
All mss. except K4 add to janram (janaram.?) the syn. xrun
ram.ca “murder and bloodshed”; the text cannot be safely
restored, vizbyo is dat.pl., OI. vidbhyas; in Beh. §14 we find
OP. vi^bis, 01. vidbhis, the instr. which replaces the dative in OP.
dvafsah, in 44,14 dvafsa, has neither etymology nor con
tinuation; the Pahl. transl. did not understand the text: it uses
freft, hence thought of V dab- “deceive.”
dafsnya: cf. Y.10,15: “ya manyate davayati, ha ya dafta
apanasyati, she who thinks (I am the one) who deceives (out
wits), shall (be she who) perish(es) deceived.” This dafta is
simple predicate; the Gath, form is an invitation or permission:
“dafsniya hantu, they shall be tobe-deceived-ones,” i.e. deceit
is permissible against these deceivers. Herodotus, 111,65, makes
the dying Cambyses say: “eire SoXw exovcri avrrjv r^ye/xo
viTjv) KTTjcrdfievoi 86X<w d.Traipe^Tji'at ^776 vfxecov, if they have
obtained the dominion by deceit, you shall take it from them
by deceit,” almost a translation of the Gathic words and entirely
Persian in concept. Like the words about ^Astyartes and the
resurrection in the Prexaspes story, this must come from an
excellent Persian source. Iratu and astu refer both to the same
subject, ho, and maziko belongs to astu, “he (not: it) shall be,”
cf. Hertel, iiqf 1,45 n.i.
To St.9: The parallelism of the two stanzas requires a close
correspondence between duzvarsnaho dafsniya hantu and
duzvarsnais veso rasti. The exact meaning of veso rasti is here
of no consequence: instead of Vra^-, I prefer \Tad- to connect
rasti with, “is prepared, destined for them”; veso, quite un
known, I assume, is a word for “death, annihilation.” Tedesco
explained to me the difficulties of the sentence “toi narpis arjis
a isasa”: “narpis and arjis seem to be two acc.pl.; the verb



BANDVA AND GRAHMA 201
ought to be contained in a isasa.” This might be V is-, es- in
the sense “to seek (a person’s life),” c£. Y/.io,45: yim isanti
mi^ra.dru|o, “to waylay,” also Y.32,12: “xsa^ramca isnam
drujam.” Vnarp- is syn. of Vzya- “to diminish, impair.”
Varg- is “to be fair, have claim to,” cf. AltpJnschr. s.v.
arzanam = Akk. simannu “convenance.” ar)i perhaps “entitled
(to inheritance), legitimate.” Thus we arrive at the translation:
“Therefore, those whose acts are evil shall be allowed to be deceived.
Deserted they shall all scream. With his fellow-^sa^riya he shall achieve
murder and carnage among them and peace for the joyous clans. He
shall bring down torture upon them and the fetters of death, and the
greatest, at once, he will be!”
“To those who act with evil arbitrariness, death is destined ( ?). They
who seek the life(?) of the deprived(?) legitimate ones(?), where
is the ahura, faithful to Rtam, to deprive them of life and liberty?
Mazdah, Thine is the kingdom by which Thou wilt give to the right
living poor the Best!”
Nyberg calls these verses, 153, “an das Hochzeitsritual [Y.53,1-7,
where in his opinion Purucista pretends as goddess of fertility] ange
hangte derbe Fliiche iiber die Druganhanger.” Lommel, nggw, 1935,
M)i 37 * “Damit spricht Zarathustra . . . aus, dass er von guten Herr
schern riicksichtsloses Durchgreifen erwartet.” The two stanzas are
attached in the Awesta to the “Wedding Gatha” for the only reason
that both have the same rare and late meter, and because the meter
dominates the arrangement. Nor are the verses an instruction for
sergeants. They are a demand to kill the tkesa, mobaS of the bandva.
Though Nyberg portrays Zoroaster as a hashshash, yet he was no grand
master of the Assassins. His religion is, from the start, a political mis
sion, but if he hopes for or recommends an assassination three times in
his few songs, it is not each time different persons, but the same persons
that shall be killed.
ahura, which refers to the mazika, brother-in-law or step-brother of
Zoroaster, in Y.49,1, has here, too, the meaning: somebody entitled to
inflict imprisonment and even capital punishment, a power otherwise

e.g. in Y/.io,io9—owned only by the sastar hamaxsa^ra, the military



202 BANDVA AND GRAHMA
commander-in-chief of the empire. At the same time it means “son of
the king,” a title expressed in ¥^.14,59 by ahura.pu^raho, in parallel
with pu^raho bevarpatayo, and Zoroaster promises here to the ahura
who will kill the tkesa and drugvant, the magus and impostor: mazista
mosuca astu!, the ahura mazista, successor to the throne, at once he
will be!
He brings syati—the OP. syn. of raman—to the dispossessed clans.
To do that is in pre-Zoroastrian polytheism the work of a god; Mithra,
before all, is the rama.sayana, also Tistriya. Darius’ words in NiR a
“hya imam syatim ada” show the Zoroastrian concept of Ahura
Mazdah as rama.sayana. So does Vid.i “azam daSam aso ramaSatim
noit kudat.satim” (see under ‘Videvdad’). Since remotest antiquity,
this quality has belonged to the ideal ruler who brings an “era of bliss.”
Cyrus says in his Ur inscription, as other Babylonian and Assyrian kings
before him: “I made the people abide in peace” (see under ‘Mithra’).
The ahura who with his companions, the hu^sa^ra, shall cause the
syati of the vi^, is such an expected ideal ruler. “For Thine is the
Xsa^ram, the kingly power, to give the kingdom, aryanam xsa^ram,
to him who now is poor, narpis, drigus, but soon will own the king
dom!”
The words are spoken in the circle round Vistaspa, and are addressed
to the ahura, the sons of Vistaspa and their young friends. Zoroaster
expects that one of them will kill the tkesa and grahma, mobaS and
favorite of his brother-in-law whom fate had already overtaken.
According to the traditional date, Zoroaster was born in 569 b.c. The
“Wedding-Gatha,” Y.53,1-7, is some years younger than the Memorial
List, of about 527, in which Purucista is still a child, not yet 16 years
old. Y/.53,8-9, too, is younger; it belongs therefore in the last years of
Cambyses or the nine months of Gomata. The reasons for not mention
ing names are obvious.
The bandva is Cambyses, his mobaS and favorite is Gomata, the
magus.
When Cambyses confirmed Zoroaster’s proscription, he was, accord
ing to Y.49,1, still successor, mazista, and at the same time lord justiciary
in the home country of Zoroaster, Raga. In 539 b.c., the year of the
conquest of Babylon, he was, quite young, “sar Babili, king of Baby



BANDVA AND GRAHMA 203
Ion,” but only during that year, and no western records tell where he
went. The assumption closest at hand is that he learned how to rule
in Media, the largest and most important province of the empire, at
Agbatana, the town to which he returned before his suicide. Ctesias
says that he obtained this and other provinces when Cyrus settled the
succession. Tabari has preserved the documents of an analogous settle
ment of the caliph al-Mutawakkil : the first successor, al-Muntasir, not
yet adult, received the west and the center of the empire, the second,
al-Mu‘tazz, a small boy, Khurasan in the widest extent (so does Smerdis
according to Ctesias). Thus, Raga, as a Median zantu was under the
jurisdiction of Cambyses as satrap of Media. Already at that time, he
was entirely under the influence—ci^snuso—of his magus and qadi,
tkesa, Gomata, who apparently taught him to rule. For this there are
many later examples. Mutawakkil appointed the tutors and viziers of
the princes, for al-Mu‘tazz e.g. Ahmad b. Isra’il. At the events that
led to the murder of Mu'tazz, the commander of the Turkish guards,
arrested this Ahmad who played the sinister role of Gomata with
Mu'tazz, and the young caliph said: “Give me Ahmad back, he is my
secretary and has educated me!” (Tabari 111,1707). It is likewise cus
tomary to appoint such a man regent during a ghaiba, an absence, just
as Cambyses when leaving for Egypt made Gomata “coropastes” (Akk.
qardupatu or NP. qahraman, Herodotus’ /xeXeSwi'o? rwv olk'iojv, major
domo), the dbita drugva, who deceived him too: “The deceivers shall
be those to be deceived!”
The “Gatha of the Flight” was composed while Zoroaster lived in
Vistaspa’s hospitium, after the marriage to the Haugavi, at the occasion
of the journey of the two Haugava to the court of appeal of the great
king, of Cyrus, while Cambyses was still heir apparent, hence a few
years after 539, but before 529 b.c. The lord justiciary and the judge
are not mentioned in these verses, but in st.4 it is said to be a meritorious
deed to deprive the drugvant, evidently the judge, of his xsa^ram,
office, and life.
In Y.32,5 the same drugvant is x^ayo, a word meaning any high
position of power. The time is the reign of Cambyses, to whom the
abstr. expression kavitat alludes; Gomata, one of the karpatat, of the
magi, is his grahma, favorite.
In Y.49, the end of Cambyses is foreseen, the disappearance of Go



204 BANDVA AND GRAHMA
mata expected as its sequel, and the prophet hopes to obtain the frasastis
and therewith the revocation of his banishment. This brings the verses
near to the end of Cambyses’ reign, to 523 b.c.
Y.53,8-9 is composed after the revenge of rtam and vahumano had
struck Cambyses in his suicide—oso vida—as the oracle of Buto had
announced, in the beginning of 522 b.c.
The §§11-14 of the Behistun inscription are Darius’ answer to this
gatha, written only two years after. The “vi^bi^’ to whom Darius
restored their ge^a and maniya, of which Gomata, the zitarta, had
deprived them, dita krta, are the ahvisca ahuvasca of Y.32,11, whom
the drugvant, Cambyses, had robbed of their re^naho, and the very
“syatibyo vizbyo” of Y.53,8, syata, joyous, because they no longer needed
to be “afraid he, Gomata, might kill many, darsam atarsa karam vasai
avajanya, who had known BrSya-Brzyarstis before, hya parvam brSyam
aSana.”
Zoroaster calls Cambyses his bandva, and bandva, like Gr. vlvdepos,
designates affinitas through women, mother or sister. Affinitas existed
between the Spitama and the older branch of the Achaemenid house
since the marriage of the daughter of Astyages to Cyrus. According to
Ctesias, Spitakes son of Spitamas and this daughter, was a half-brother
of Cambyses through their mother, bandva can express step-brothership,
through the same mother, not through the father. But this relation is
not true: Cambyses was not the son of Astyages’ daughter, but of Kas
sandane. In reality, Spitakes and Cambyses both had in Atossa a half
sister, Spitakes through his mother, Cambyses through his father. Also
this relationship through their sister would be expressed by bandva.
Atossa, not born before 549 b.c., was not married before 533 to Cam
byses, perhaps only in 529. The gatha 49 is later than 529. Bandva
would equally cover the relation between Spitakes and Cambyses as
husband of the sister.
Zarathustra Spitama uses for his relationship to Cambyses the term
bandva which covers the relationship of Ctesias’ Spitakes, son of
Spitama, to Cambyses, in every aspect. While the traditional date for
Zoroaster s birth, 529 b.c. left enough space for his being either the
Spitakes or the Spitamas of Ctesias, the word “bandva” decides that he
is Spitakes, the grandson of Astyigas by his daughter, the mother of Atossa.



XII. MAGOPHONIA
“When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled.”
In Beh. §13, Darius says that with his six companions he killed the
magus Gomata and his principal adherents on the loth of bagayadis,
i.e. September 29, 522 b.c. That is his answer to Y.53,9: huxsa^rais jan
ram xrunramca dadatu ! The place was Gomata’s castle at Sikayahvatis
in Nisaya, Media, mod. Sikawand in Nisa, between Kirmanshahan and
Harsin.
The Greek tradition goes back to three popular reports. Herodotus
and Ctesias ignore the true name of Gomata; Ctesias calls him Spenda
dates. In Her. 111,16—the source would be Dionysius of Milet according
to Markwart, uge. 11,145—the magus has become a pair of brothers; the
name of the really active one is there the name of the
other, who is put in the foreground as a natural double of Smerdis, was
—by chance and with no advantage to the story—also Smerdis. A third
tradition, in Trogus, according to Ndldeke Herodotus’ precursor Chares
of Lampsacus, speaks also of a pair, but calls the one with his true name
Cometes < TcojX'qrrj'?, the other “oropastes, coropastus.” The endeavor
of the popular tradition to make the imposture more conceivable by
doubling the agents is evident.
The word TTan^dO-qs exists : Arm. payazat “heir” < OMed. *pa0ya
zati, deriv. of (hu)pa0yazata in Ogmad., OP. ‘pasyazata “collateral
heir.” IlaTt^ei^Tjs hence was not the brother of the Pseudo-Smerdis,
but the title of the true Smerdis, confirming Ctesias’ report on the
settlement of Cyrus’ succession.—The office of the magus is explained,
more than once, in Herodotus, by tS)v oIkuov fieXeSavo'; or eTrtrpoTrov,^
i.e. majordomo. This is what Trogus’ coro-, oropastes must signify : a title,
not a brother of the magus, probably to be linked with the OP. title
rendered in Akk. by “qardupatu sa sarri,” an officer only responsible to
the king, not to a satrap.
Ctesias (Photius) transfers the name spantadata > Isfandiyar from
Darius to Gomata in saying “The Persians celebrate the festival of
^ In vn,56 (Doriskos) Herodotus uses the expression eTriTpoTrevaas to designate a vice-satrap, cf. ^aciXei's: ^a<Tt\€vwv, ^acrtXevcras, viz. Megapanos of Babylonia. To cor[d]opa <1 s ]> ta cf. Aw. kr^wa “who takes care,” and NP. Arab, qahrum^ “majordomo,” similar to ustadar, peskar.



2o6 MACMPHONIA
magophonia, at which the magus Spendadates was killed,” if this is not
a fault of transmission for “was killed by Spendadates.”
The day of the murder was the festival of Mithra in the middle of his
month mi^rakana. It is necessary to emphasize that the murder hap
pened at this festival, and that this was not constituted in commemora
tion of the murder. All Greeks describe it as the main popular festival.
The king, else invisible like a god—navrl doparos (Aristotle) —had
to show himself to the people. Ctesias frgm. 55M.: "napa 8e Ilepcrat? rw
ySacrtXet e^terai pedvcrKeadat pia rjpepa iv fj dvova-i tw Midpr).”
“The day on which they sacrifice to Mithra” is a correct translation of
“bagayadis,” Mithra being the baga par excellence. According to Duris
of Samos (in Athenaeus) the king not only got drunk on this day, but
danced in public, which was considered good exercise: Trjv ex rfj?
ipyacrir)'; Tai^rTj? KLvr)(riv ippeXi] riva Xap^dveLV yvpvacrLyjv rov
crdtpaTO? p(aprj<;. If Herodotus remarks that no magus was allowed to
show himself, (ftavrjvai is to <f)d)s, on this day, all were to stay at home,
this may be true without any relation to the “murder of the magus”: I
believe it is the nth day after Noruz where, on the contrary, it would
bring ill-luck to stay at home, and the Mat. Siroz calendar knows simi
lar superstitions. Even Gomata could not break the old custom, but had
to observe the pre-Zoroastrian festival and to show himself in public.
Therefore, the seven conspirators chose that very day for killing him.
Markwart had recognized, as early as in his Assyria\a, 1892, p.653,
and later in uge.ii, 132 and 135, that Herodotus’ expression “mago
phonia” is an interpretation of OP. bagayadis, with mago- for baga-,
as often mega- for baga-. That Ctesias makes use of Herodotus’ term
indicates that the passage was part of his polemics against Herodotus,
and his words “the day on which they sacrifice to Mithra” prove that
he knew the true meaning." Dinon tells, Artaxerxes Ochos, being told
~ In jR.xs 1944,134, Henning attacks that meaning of bagayaSis, (i) “only case of vrddhi in
OP. month-names, not counting ^aigrcis (of uncertain etymology)”: El. writes “so” for “ 0a,” indicating the pronunciation “6i”; vrddhi of 0igr-, Aw. sivr-, NP. sir “garlic,” Vcl- “Icgere, gather” exactly Germ. “Knoblauch-lese.” El. transcription torwara demands also 0dravara
hence 0ura with vrddhi, and vahara invers for -vara < vahara. Also markazanis, not *mrka-; aSukanis, all vrddhi. (2) A “form of V yaz-, corresponding to yadi, unknown,” is OP. a.yadana, Aw. *ayazana in Gr. la.cbvi.Qv\ cf. OI. ati-, pra-yaja. (3) “Pre-Iran. *atr.yaziya would appear in OP. as *at(a)ryadiya.” Since OP. has ga0u, *pr0u for Med. -tu, it had also for tr; hence a0^iyadiya is regular OP., with vriddhi, and -yadi-. {4) The opposition of “western and

that the Egyptians called him “ones, ass,” said: This ass shall eat your
ox!, and e^vere rov '^Amv, slaughtered the Apis. Thus, ^opo? enters for
V
yaS-, dveiv, by a popular etymology. For the Greeks, bagayadis meant
“slaughtering of the magi,” but in the mouth of a Persian such a name
for their highest festival would have been bitter sarcasm. Herodotus
was too wise to say that the festival commemorated the murder of the
magus, but only “the Persians call it magophonia,” namely OP.
bagayadis, while the other Iranians say mi^rakana. And even when he
adds “after the murder, the mob assailed also the other magi”—Darius
only: Gomata and his main adherents; and the notion that these were
all magi is of course wrong—“if night had not fallen, they would have
killed them all,” the slaughter would still be limited—^failing mega
phone, telegraph and radio—to the small place of Sikayahvatis.
There is no sense in doubting—Nyberg 376 (and 579) —Markwart’s
interpretation, and in trusting Herodotus—“si Herodoto fidem habe
mus, hatten die Perser noch zur Zeit Herodots zur Erinnerung (an
das Blutbad) das Fest der Magophonie gefeiert,” because Herodotus
does not say so.®
After Cyrus’ death, Cambyses had incarcerated and secretly executed
the pa%azata Smerdis, and during his absence in Egypt he had con
ferred the lieutenancy to his favorite Gomata, as ’cor[d]opates. This
impostor succeeded in impersonating Smerdis, and in winning over so
eastern” use of baga for Mithra is a worn out pseudo-argument: Mithra was universal, and what we know is only a Median and Persian Mithra. If in a calendar, introduced by order of the Achaemenian government [the name younger or older Awestan is indifferent], not
miSrakana, but bagakana > Sogd. ba7akan [and in analogy the day name ba7a, not mifira;
>Xvar. bi7] appears, then, not the Median [Strabon’s mithrakina] but the OP. form of the name was introduced, and the OP. name of the month was *bagakana, w'ith the festival of bagayadis. ^ The Man. Sogd. word “mw7zt, killing of the Magians, not: feast devoted to remembrance of that act, ascribed to .Alexander,” a story the Manichaeans took over from Sasanian priests, can never prove, as Henning l.c. wishes to maintain, that the magi transferred Darius’ act to Alexander. His w'ords, 133: “(the Persians) instituted an annual feast to remind the Magians of their humiliation: it was called ra iia-foipovia. Her. ill. 79" are his, not Herodotus'. And Gilmore’s remark to Ctesias §46: “agreement of Herodotus and Ctesias" is unwarranted, for we do not have Ctesias’ full text, but two fragments which may well be polemic: the one mentions the name magophonia, the other says "ev J eiovai rSt Miflpij.” This is a correct translation of OP. bagayadis, not of Med. MiSrakana. “Com.promises” are alwavs bad, and so the one Henning chooses: that the two festivals, bagayada-Mihrgan = autumnal equinox, and magophonia = the loth day of bagayadi, coincided at the year of Gomata's death. The slip shows how impossible it is to avoid the right conclusion: the month was called miSrakana and bagakana, because it was the month of the bagayadis festival.

great a following that Cambyses, in despair, committed suicide,* and
that the impostor became, for nine months, actual ruler of the newly
founded empire. The reaction was a conspiracy of the few who knew,
and a group of seven young men of the high nobility destroyed the
impostor, cleverly choosing the festival for their plan: duzvarsnaho
dafsniya hantu! Besides this cause celebre of the world’s history all
those of criminal history fade away, and if ever it is justified to speak
of a unique case, it is here. “Dass es sich im Falle des Gaumata um
einen wirklichen allgemeinen Aufruhr von ihrer (the magi’s) Seite
handelt” (Nyberg,356) is not “fiber alien Zweifel erhaben,” but a mis
construction.
A general revolt of the magi would mean a general strike of the civil
service, the activity of which can never have been interrupted. “Den
Charakter dieses Aufstandes hat man meines Erachtens vollig missver
standen, als man darin einen Religionskampf sehen wollte: es ist die
medische Herrschaft, die noch einmal ihr Haupt erhebt.” Whoever is
meant by “man” but similar opinions have repeatedly been uttered
since Vivien de Saint Martin and Heeren; indeed, Herodotus makes
the dying Cambyses say: firj nepuSeiv ttjv rjyepoviriv avris e? MtjSovs
TTepiikdovcrav. But Gomata just does not appear as what he was, a
magus—that he was a Median is not at all proved—but as heir presump
tive of the Persian Cyrus, he owes his success to the uprising of the
Persians in Persis against Cambyses, marries, for legitimization’s sake,
Atossa, the heiress, without showing himself to her, and—since he kept
himself invisible at Sikayahvatis—would have known how to hide
successfully his true aims to the very last. The second Pseudo-Smerdis,
likewise, relied upon the Persians’ hatred of Cambyses. Fravartis, the
Median pretender, actually tried “to bring the hegemony back to the
Medes.” The revolts in the East Iranian provinces were directed against
the strict centralization of the Achaemenid empire, and were politically
reactionary. The rebellions in Babylon were attempts to recuperate the
lost independence. Nowhere does the hand of the magi show itself.
A “general revolt of the magi” would have been aimed at Cambyses,
and would have been victorious with Gomata’s accession; it would have
been no concern of Darius, not an “Aufstand den er unterdrficken
Herzfeld, "Tod d. Kamhyses- hvamrsyus ainr\ata" in bui.l. sos vin.igyd, 389-97; add there, on p. 594f. the example v.Rawl.9,33: “ihiuha mitutu, his desire was suicide.”



MAGOPHONIA 209
musste.” With Gomata’s triumph, the elder line of the Achaemenids
had come to a premature end, and the claim to succession passed to
Rsama and his son Vikaspa, at that time in Parthava. Gomata must
have reckoned with being murdered and must have seen danger from
the circle round Vikaspa. But that it was precisely Darius who became
the agent was an historical accident. Not the alleged “revolt of the magi”
was the goal of the conspiracy, but the legitimate succession. This fight
would be, on p.295, “religids gesehen ein Kampf zwischen achaemeni
dischem Hofkult und Staatsreligion gegen den Medischen Kult der
Magier,” while, on p.375, it would be “a complete misunderstanding,
darin einen Religionskampf zu sehen.” “Welche religiosen Motive
immer die Magier in diesem Streit erfiillten, jedenfalls gingen sie nicht
um Zarathustras willen in ihn . . . ich leugne ganz bestimmt . . . dass
der Zoroastrismus . . . daran Anteil hatte. . . . Der Zoroastrismus hat
bei den Magiern keine Kreuzzugsstimmung ausgelbst. . . . Die Magier
wurden die Priester der Achaemeniden Kambyses’ Zug nach Aegyp
ten gab. . . . Wind in die Segel, und ‘so’ kam es zu dem Aufstand. . . .
Als der Kampf abgeblasen war . . . , als der Sturm sich gelegt hatte,
gewannen die Magier ‘natiirlich’ ihre Stellung . . . zuriick.” The whole
fight—for this fight is a fight against windmills—the whole noise is
for a false St. Bartholomew, the wrong interpretation of magophonia =
bagayadis as “murder of the magi” instead of “sacrifice to Mithra.”
Darius killed the magus, but never fought the magi.
Occasionally an entirely opposite opinion has been advanced, namely
identification of Gomata himself with Zoroaster. To this view Meillet
was inclined when he said (Trots Conf.’j^) of Gomata: “un veritable
sectateur de Zoroastre, ce que n’etait pas Darius lui-meme.” Markwart,
at various places, and Messina, Ursprung der Magier 90, speak similarly.
One could support such a view by Herodotus 111,67, where he attributes
to Gomata a number of measures, intended to attract the lower classes
to himself against the ruling ones. As Herodotus describes it, it would
be a radical disorganization of the old social order. The restoration
which Darius describes in Beh. §14 puts Herodotus’ story in the right
light. The situation reminds one of the restoration under Xusrau I
after the communist episode of Mazdak. But one cannot avoid thinking
that Herodotus might give, partly, a distorted picture of reforms actually
due to Zoroaster.



210 MAGOPHONIA
On Darius’ fight against the magi, Nyberg builds up, 362, his theory
of Darius’ religion. As captatio benevolentiae he concedes that Zoro
aster’s name need not to appear in royal inscriptions of a country
uniformly Zoroastrian of old. This not being the case, Darius had every
reason to make his Zoroastrism known to the world, the more so, “da
er, wenn wir Hertel, Herzfeld u.a. glauben diirfen—fidem habemus

einen Kampf auf Leben und Tod mit G5mata fiir den Bestand der
zoroastrischen Religion gewagt hatte.” He calls it more than remark
able that Darius has no room for the Amosa Spanta and no word for
the daena mazdayasnis. A definite indication of the daena would
under no condition be permitted to be missing. Climax: all this would
be an entirely inexplicable and unthinkable ( ! ) attitude for a neophyte.
Zoroaster deserves reproach for having no room for the Amrta Spanta
and the dena as much as Darius; only, the “Immortal-Holy ones” were
brought into a system after his time, and the notion and term dena
mazdayasnis is not older than Artaxerxes II. On the other hand, it is
unjust to reprove Darius for his silence, and yet not to commend Xerxes
for saying some words on asa [he writes rtam] or Artaxerxes for com
bining in his name two of the Amrta Spanta. I cannot speak for Hertel,
but it is certainly not my way “to risk a fight to death for the existence”
of a thing that did not exist before.—A country parson may demand
of his candidate for confirmation to say a word about the religion, but
who are we to dictate, 2,500 years after, to the ruler of the then known
world, who himself legitimatized one of the many religions of his em
pire, to legitimatize himself by certificate of baptism and confirmation,
or to tell the people something about Amrta Spanta unknown to them.
He demands, like many much smaller people today, that one knows
who he is. “I am the worshipper and agent of Oramazda, and Oramazda
is the greatest of gods” is all he needs to tell the 127 nations of his
kingdom.

Because of the fundamental importance of this stanza for the life of
Zoroaster, I had briefly indicated my interpretation of vypyv as n.pr.
vefik, in ami.viii, Nov. 1936; with some commentary in Old Iranian
Peership, bsos.viii,i937, p.938, and in Altplnschr. 1938, p.199,2. Ny
berg’s book is the result of lectures given in the spring of 1935, and
appeared October 1937 in Swedish, and April 1938 in Schaeder’s Ger
man translation. On p.403 he writes: “Die uns den vornehmen Adligen
Zarathustra malen, wie er sich auf den Hohen der achaemenidischen
Gesellschaft bewegt, . . . unter den Spitzen des Reichs, gehen weiter als
es sich die Zoroastrier des Westens je haben traumen lassen.” Note: “So

He operates several times with West and East Iranian dreams, and
of hashish smokers to boot; I find it difficult enough to see the truth of
what people say when awake. The remark about my painting is more
than a year older than my alleged emendation, and refers in fact to
AMi.11,1 (1930) —where Zoroaster moves on the heights of society; the
footnote has been added belatedly with a wrong reference. So he proves
the “callousness”; as to the “speechlessness” Herakleitos said: ySXa^

Nyberg refrains from giving would have been more effective than a
mere rejection, the passion of which is easy to understand: if this vypyv

namely all translations so far made, the authority of which I am ex
pected to respect, and I would reject them even if they were gram
matically correct. It is time to speak bluntly and unadornedly.
Bartholomae: “Nicht hat ihn zufrieden gestellt der Buhlknabe des

ihm verwehrte, bei ihm Unterkunft zu nehmen, und als sie zu ihm
kamen, auch dessen vor Kalte zitternden Zugtieren.” Note: “Eine
sehr bemerkenswerte Strophe. Das Ereignis das sie verewigt ist: Zara

aber dessen zu Bandva (s. Anm.ii) haltender Besitzer—verachtlich
wird er darum als sein ‘Buhlknabe’ bezeichnet—weist ihn zuriick.’'
Anm.ii: “Bandva.?”—Anm.12: “Ortsname.”
Bartholomae takes caratasca as dual pres, for praeter. (subj.: vaza
“two-horse team”), audrs as gen.abl. “with cold,” zoisnu as nom.acc.
His explanation sounds of a miscarried carriage drive, and according
to his translation, Zoroaster arrives before his horses. These, therefore,
must have known their way, and we have the situation of Mas‘udi’s
tale, in muriid] vii,32of., where a noble Quraishite, banished to ‘Arafat,
denies having continued his orgies there, and the people of Mecca say
to their Wali: “There is a decisive proof between us and him. Call for
the donkeys of the jobbers and let them run to ‘Arafat; if they do
not go straight for his house, as the libertines have accustomed them
to do, you may accept his word! The Wali said: Therein is a proof in
deed! and called for the donkeys. They were brought, set loose, and ran
straightway to the plaintiff’s house. The Wali was informed and ex
claimed: Thereafter we need no other proof !”^
The bandva, in Y.49, has jurisdiction over Zoroaster’s home-town. In
Y.51, also in 46, the prophet is in flight, and comes further on to Vis
taspa’s place. No word indicates any relation between the “owner of
the manor-house” and the bandva. He is abused only because he refused
hospitality to the fugitive. Mtf/rA.25.43: fevos rjjjLiqv Kal ov crvirqydyeTe

as a support for his translation of vypyv by “Buhiknabe.” Thus the
situation arises which Lommel and Nyberg develop: Zoroaster would
have asked the Buhlknaben of his deadly enemy for night-shelter, and
complained, “auf dem Hdhepunkt seines Wirkens,” “in feierlicherem
und schwerer gewordenem Rhythmus,” not to have been “zufrieden
gestellt,” satisfied by him.
Lommel: “Der Fiirstenknecht Vaepiyo ( = der entartete Liistling)
der weites Land besitzt, erwies Zarathustra dadurch keinen Gefallen,
dass er ihm verwehrte zu ihm zu kommen, als seine beiden Zugtiere
zu ihm eilten und auch vor Kalte zitterten.” Note: “vaepyo: v(o)ipoyo,
viell. Personenname (Andreas); doch ist Bartholomaes Ankniipfung
an Vvip- ‘widernatiirliche Unzucht treiben’ wohl moglich: Zarathustra
hat in verdammendem Zorn harte Worte gebraucht.”
If Zoroaster was displeased by the refusal of the voipoyo to receive
him, the opposite would have pleased him and he would better have
curbed his indignation. “Satisfy” is utterly wrong; Vx^rih- tneans “to
listen to,” here to the entreaty of being received in hospitium.
KVYNV—cf. the spelling yavino—is kavyano, normal patron, adj., the
“kavian.” “Fiirstenknecht” is an anachronistic blame: Darius calls his
greatest grandees “mana bandaka”; the highest Arab and Kurdish
grandees call themselves and their sons, in face of the caliphs and sul
tans, always “thy slaves.” In NP. the word for “I” is “bandah, the
slave.” That is but an honor. One of my first slips in the East, near
Mossul, was in asking a negro: Are you the servant of such and such.?
His offended answer was: No, his slave!
Andreas read uSurs, judging from his translation “sie zitterten”;
this plur. of a perfect would then be connected by -ca -ca with the dual
of the present caratas; zoisnu seems to be translated by “vor Kalte,”
hence instr.sg., which cannot be reconciled with the other occurrences
of the word. The difficulty existing in Bartholomae’s translation is not
solved.
The apodosis with yat—^yat means: “when he (V.) refused
hospitality to him (Z.), when (he refused it) to the accompany
ing-ones of his (or: to him and his) and to the shivering-with
cold two-horse team.” I owe the e.xplanation of the hidden

stands in parallel with the acc. dual vaza, determined by odrs
zoisnu, placed in front and connected by -ca -ca with caratas.
This, therefore, is not a verb, but an acc.pl., namely of the part,
carant, which has the obj. “im.” In Altp.lnschr. 5if., I had
explained OP. abicaris in Beh.^ia, as acc.pl. “the attendants,”
to OI. abhicara, Gr. amphipolos. “im carato,” here, has the
same meaning. Germ, “die ihn Begleitenden,” his servants. The
last verse has no verb of its own, and the repetition of yat indi
cates that yat rurost is valid for the whole. The simplest trans
lation of this yat would be “and likewise.” Whether or not the
gen. hoi “whose,” is correct, is a question here negligible,
because it would involve no change.
Instead of the owner of the manor-house “Winter’s Gate,” Lommel’s
translation has a great land-owner whose fortune “olet.” But why, then,
did the horses that have been running and ought to be all of a sweat,
shiver “also” with cold, and who else shivered? In the whole of Iran
and Turkistan, for at least half the year, it is so hot that the horses ought
to be in sweat without running. Here, too, Zoroaster does not describe,
but argues: the “Winter’s Gate” is the reason why they shiver, hence
no placename, but a season. The season is December-January.
It stands correctly in the genitive, like OP. ^sapa “by night,”
0arda “in the year,” mahya < mahahya “in the month.” Wb.
takes prto as loc.sg., instead of prtau, written prta in Y.51,13, of
“prtu, passage, ford, bridge,” only here “entrance, porta,” to
V^par-. ,prto zamo‘ must be a compound, hence ’^prta.zimo.
The first element equals Aw. p3sa, i.e. prta, which enters in the
compounds “prta.canga, with claws out-spread,” Y/.i5,ii3
describing the dragon humayaka; and “prta.parna, with wings
stretched out,” Y/.i4,35, describing the varagan bird, both

proved genuine by their sculptures (see under ‘Sculpture’).
Wb. compares it with OI. sphuta, “unfolded (leaves).” Thus
the name resembles “porta hiemis” but means “where the win
ter unfolds itself,” a name of the same type as Aw. “zimahe
zarSaem, the winter’s heart” in and OP. “^auravahara,
where spring becomes 0ura, powerful over the winter” or
“garma.pada, heel, track of warmth.”
Nyberg 244 and 154: “Der Auftakt zu Y.51 schildert den Hdhepunkt
von Zarathustras Wirken im Friyana-Stamm . . . , der Rhythmus ist
schwerer und feierlicher . . .
,
der Auftakt giebt eine Ordalszenerie . . .
,
es sieht so aus, als habe Zarathustra jetzt endlich die grosse Krise (yah)
erreicht, von der er so oft gesprochen hatte. In str.i-io werden denn
auch die eschatologischen Saiten kraftig angeschlagen.” Since “strings
are touched,” “Auftakt” cannot mean “arsis” but only “overture”; the
curtain rises over an “ordeal scenery,” the refusal of the vypyv, which
at the same time is the “acme of Zoroaster’s work in the Friyana tribe.”
“Heavier rhythm”; the meter has two pada less than the ga^a ahunavati.
Zoroaster never “speaks of” the crisis “yah,” he shouts “ya-ahi! hurrah!”
but only in the last act. No word hints at eschatology; the gatha is a
thanksgiving to Vistaspa. And yet “Auftakt to Y.51” is no printer’s
error, for it goes on; “Der Prophet fragt; Wer ist Mysteriengenosse,
wer hat die Ekstase im maga erlebt.^ Antwort; Nicht der unziichtige
kavi-Bube . . . solche fahren in die Hblle . . . seligeres Los ist den maga
Mannern beschert; Das grosse Ereignis ist dies, dass Vistaspa jetzt die
Ekstase erlebt hat und dadurch ein vollmiindiges' Mitglied des maga
geworden ist.”
“maga” is the feast after the racing, the “hochgezite”; “magavan, the
guest at the feast,” see under ‘Maga.’ Fellow of mysteries: “rva^a,
friend” means here, like amicus in Roman law, “hospes,” who gives
hospitium. Everything is more blissful, “seliger” than hell. There is no
trace of ecstasy. Bandva is no name, but an appellative, p.119; “Er heisst
mazista . . . vielleicht war er ein kavi, und vielleicht war es sein un
ziichtiger Bube (der ‘kavische’), der eines Abends an der ‘Pforte des
Winters’ dem Spitama Zarathustra das Quartier verweigerte, obwohl
seine beiden Pferde vor Kalte zitterten.”
One may be “voIl)dhrig*’ or “rniindig,” but “vollmiiiiiiig” would rather mean “with a full mouth.”



2i6 HOUSE \'EH\'IYA
This gives the tale the finishing touch; “one evening” is not in the
text, but is the thought simply crowding into one’s mind when reading
these translations: did Zoroaster, one evening, come with his team to
the “unchaste knave” to pray with him—according to the famous
words of the presumptions to the Corpus Juris, or, with Hertel “um
den schlecht-leuchtenden durch das Licht-des-Heils zu erfreuen” ? This
again reminds one of an Arab veni-vidi-vici anecdote in the }{it. d
Aghdni 17,189: “A courtier of al-Ma’mun, during the Byzantine cam
paign, in a pitch black storm night, met with the greatest singer of her
time, the beautiful Barmacid ‘Arib, on horseback, and asked her:
Where do you come from in such a night?—From Muhammad b.
Hamid (an officer, her lover).—But what have you been doing there?
And she answers: ‘Arib comes from Muhammad b. Hamid, in such a
night, run away from the caliph’s camp, and now riding back, and,
that being the situation, you ask her; what have you been doing there?,
perchance praying twenty raq‘a, reading a chapter of the Qur’an, or
giving a lesson in jurisprudence? Blockhead! Cavillati, confabulati,
reconciliati sumus, lusimus, bibimus, cantavimus, coivimus, abivimus!
—The hearer was put to blush.”
Nyberg 297: “Die Anrufung der fravarti des Hvogva hilft u.a. gegen
oifra ‘schlechte Seher.’ ” Note: “So geschrieben fiir vifra ‘kundig,’ seiner
seits gleich Ved. vipra ‘inspirierter Sanger’;^ Bartholomaes schreckliche
Erklarung ^^^.357 ist mir unfassbar.” This is: “pathicus, statt vifra,
zu Vvaep-, vgl. vaepya-.” Nyberg does not seem to have come across
Djuwaini’s description of the shamans, tar. D]ihdngushd 1,43s, or that
in Bar Hebraeus,‘‘ else he would be aware that, in describing Zoroaster
as a shaman, he makes the prophet himself an effeminate pathicus, or
as ethnologists call them, “hermaphrodite.” Whether the invocation
of a Haugava against inspired singers—like Zoroaster—is effective—as
the silly interpolation in the name list Yr.13,104 says—or not, is indif
ferent, but not this preposterous interpretation. The vypyv plays a
remarkable role in Zoroaster’s life, and therefore, the “schreckliche”
translation of this proper name was to me “unfassbar.” The great family
of the Vefikan can be traced through over 1,200 years of Iranian his

tory. For a while, they occupied the throne. The Behistun inscription
states that they were Persians.
MP. vefikan is the adj. vefi, written v^py with the adj. ending -k.
The variants of vaepyo in Y.51,12 give vypy, read vefiya, as spelling of
the Arsacid archetype. The equation \wpy=vypy requires no proof, but
proves that Aw. vepyo and MP. vefik are the same name. There is no
“emendation.” The question is only its etymology.
In the Gr.Bdh. 128,7 we find the gentilicium vypk’n, vefa
kan; the ending -akan beside -ikan, as in Paikuli s’s’nk’n,
sasanakan, but Ka‘ba s’s’nykn, sasanikan. The simplex is vef,
the adj. vefik. According to Gr.Bdh. 128 (and similarly Sahr.Er.
§ Komis) Komis-Damghan was one of the residences of the
family (see below) ; else, they are the princes of Hyrcania-Gur
gan which adjoins to the north. The best known members of
the house are Gotarzes I, represented in iii b.c. on the rock
sculpture of Mithradates II at Bistun, bearing the title “satrap of
satraps” and coining as “arsaka gutarza, king of Babylon” from
90 to 86 B.c. And rOTAPiHi rEonoePOi who perpetuated his

tarzes I was the adopted son of Mithradates the Great. In analogy
of ‘Peofiidp-qs: rewmihr, FeoTro^pov represents gewpuhr, and the
contemporary form Meherdates < mi^radata proves that -dr
was preserved in the family name only, whereas it had changed
to -hr- in common language. The later form appears in the

In the Gr.Bdh. 197, the name Vev e Gotarzan is spelled vyv,
written with two diacritical points above the first v, indicating
the frequent pronunciation gev; the lnd.Bdh. has at the corre
sponding place giw in Aw. script. This vev, gev—later also bev,
be—son of Gotarz, is no historical figure, but merely the family
name gewpuhr personified, similar to Tos e NoSaran and
NbSar.
In the Syr. Acts of St. Thomas, the Iranian heir to the throne
is called wezan (his wife manezak), in the Greek version
Oua^dvTjs, var.l. ’lou^dr'Tj? i.e. Tov^dvrjv, the same figure as
Firdausi’s Bezan, husband of Maneza, with A an, genos”
instead of “pu^ra, son.” In Tabari and Hamza the same name
appears with imale as Ar. wajan < vezan. This vezan, too, is
no real person, but the family name or the title of the heir
apparent ‘vaspuhr e vezan; it is OMed. ‘vyv.zn. Its OP. equiva
lent VYV.DN stands for OP. vivana in the Aram, text of the
Behistun inscription, Pap.El. Sachau pl.54,8. From this OP.
form the others are distinguished by vrddhi of guna: veva.Sana
etc. In OP. vivana (Akk. “wi.wa.na, El. wi.wa.na) the a is the
product of a contraction. The Aw. correspondent is vivaqhana,
patronym of Yama in y/.i3,i30 and Vid.2, deriv. of vivahvant;
in Y.9,5 vivahvato pu^ro “son of Vivahvant,” Ved. vivasvant in
RV 10,14,5, 8,5,1. The etymology of Gath, vyptv'’, vefiyo,
hence, is not “vaepiyo, pathicus,” but the name of the god.
The MP. forms vev and vef both descend from ‘vehviya, -iya adj.
with vrddhi of \ivahva-, a plain dialectic difference: the much dis
cussed change hv > f (see under ‘Hvarnah’) belongs to the home land of
the family, Komis-Gurgan, western Parthava. But the appearance of
VYPYV in y.51,12, does not fix the time of this change as that of the gatha,
one cannot possibly assume that vefiya was actually the Old Parthian
form of the name in 530 b.c. The family was a Persian one and had come
to Parthava at that very time. One must consequently assume that the
notation vypyv' was chosen when the Awesta was first fixed in writ
ing, for rendering ‘vehviya or \evhiya of the oral tradition. This was

done under Volagases I, a.d. 51-77. He also used for the first time
Aramaic script—attested 70 years earlier on the Awraman parchment
—on his coins, while under his predecessor on the throne, the gewpuhr
Gotarzes II, A.D.41-50, proper names appear for the first time on Arsacid
coins. Gundofarr of Sigistan was their contemporary, the central figure
of the Acts of St. Thomas; his name is old vindat.hvarnah, written
guduvHara on his Indian coins. At that time, the name of the dynasty
was pronounced vefikan, and nothing was closer at hand than to note
VYPYV for oral vehviyo. It is the time when the Hyrcanian Vefikan
contended with the Atropatenian Arsacids for the throne of Iran. The
scribes were on the side of the Atropatenians, and they may have chosen
the writing in order to make the identity of the names—to them a
matter of course—understood by everybody, because in these verses
Zoroaster cursed the ancestor of their enemies.
Only a phonetic or graphic problem remains. In Y.51,12 Zoro
aster uses the form vypyv for the name of his contemporary and
peer, whom he calls “the kavian, kavyano” as vispatis of the
house. At that place \^yv must present the form generally
used. But for the mythical eponym Zoroaster uses in Y.32,8 the
form v(a)ivahuso, a nominative, to which in Y/. 19,35 the abl.
v(a)ivahusat is formed. v(a)ivahusa is derivative of Vivahus,
weak stem or nominative (Bartholomae: vocative) of *vivahvah.
In the memorial document Y/.i3,i39, about 530-525 b.c., the
OP. name visatarusi appears, fern, of the -ya adj. from the n.pr.
masc. visatarus <*visatarvah. At the same time OP. forms
ha^amanisiya from the nom. ha^amanis, see under ‘Notarya.’
Those are simultaneous neologisms of the end of the 6th cen
tufy, and only vivaphana in the Yama myth, Yr.13,130 and Vid.
2, is a traditional form. What we transliterate by -ph- is merely
the Aw. notation of old -hv-, hence Vivahvana. This is the real
and the oldest form of the family name, from which all others
descend. OP. vivana and Gath, vypyv must belong to the same
stem as this ’vivahvana, hence to *vivahva(n).^

given under ‘Mem.Doc.’ These are cases of -ahya- > e, and
vivana is the analogous case -ahva-> a (for Aw. a) : vivana <
*vivahvana.® Med. vivahvana, OP. vivana and vyv'.dn are no
longer used in later phases; we find only vezan < Med. ‘vyv.zn,
the compound gewpuhr, and the simplex vev (and gev, bev)
or vef (with adj. vef/akan), the last corresponding to vypyv in
Y.51. All these forms descend from old vrddhi formations, and
vrddhi was no longer active in MP. OP. vivana < viva
hvana and VYZDT < vahyazdata show, about 520 b.c., the vanish
ing h in these phonetic groups. Therefore, vyv.dn, i.e. vevaSana
shows veva <*vevava <*vevahva, but Gath, vypyv, less than 20
years older, shows vefiya < *vehviya *vevahviya, -iya adj. with
vrddhi of ‘vivahva-.
The Vefiya are the third known historical name in the gatha of
Zoroaster; (i) Zoroaster’s own family name Spitama = STriTap-a?,
a Median house. (2) the name of his protector Vistaspa = ‘YcrTao-7rTj?,
a Persian with a Median name. (3) the Persian house of the Vefikan,=
TeoTTodpoi.
So far, this house has been known to us since the time of Darius, cf.
AMi.iv, 58-64. hardly assume that the Median kings would have
given fiefs in Parthava to Persian families, and obviously it was Cyrus
who invested the Notarya with T5sa, the Patishvari with the country
after which they were called, and the Vivana with Komis-Gurgan. The
Viv^a of Behistun, in 522-21, only called by the family name, must be
regarded as the vispatis of the clan. The event told in the gatha hap
pened in the year of the flight, shortly after 539 b.c. Thus, the two might
be the same man, but rather father and son. The refusing attitude of
the father is comprehensible: he was subordinate to Vistaspa as satrap
of Parthava, but it is before Vistaspa had acted, and Raga, where Cam
byses had jurisdiction, was so much nearer than Tosa. In the course
of Cambyses’ reign, the son may have joined the party of the Notarya.
Judging from their name, the Vehviya regarded Yama as their heros
eponymus. Among others they bore the peculiar title “nafapatis, pater
familias” as lords of Dahistan, written nppty and n’hpty in Paikuli.

Although they were Persians, their hereditary possessions were Gurgan
and Dahistan, the former a part of Parthava. Conditions in the east
and the west of the empire were similar; the vast domains of Medes and
Persians e.g. in Asia Minor are known. As late an author as Tabari
has preserved (1,685) ^he old tradition that Bistasp, when constituting
the “Seven Houses” with the title ‘uzama’, i.e. vaspuhr, kavi, had given
Dahistan and Gurgan to the nahabaS, whom he mentions as the first
of the seven ; this means the time of Zoroaster and is historically correct.
They owned also land in Arachosia, e.g. Darius’ satrap Vivana, to whom
belonged the “rmatam Rsada,” a stud (see under ‘Armatis’), and the
Sahr.Er. ascribe to them the foundation of Raxvat, capital of Arachosia
HarahvatiL
Zoroaster speaks of the kavyano Vehviyo when fleeing from Raga
to the residence of Vistaspa, hence between Raga and Tosa. That is
the situation of the district Komis. Gr.Bdh. 128: “ataxs e frambar, its
appearance, petakih, is unknown, for without needing food, axvarisn,
it burns always, in day time as smoke, by night as fire. . . . One writes:
it is beside the palace of the Vefakan. One writes: a fire of this type is
in Komis. Also: its name is ataxs e axvarisnik, fire not needing food,
no need to breathe on it, it consumes fire-wood which one puts on it, if
one does not, it burns equally well. One writes: the Frambar fire is
even this fire.”
Mas'udi iv,74: (cf. Markwart, uge ii,24of.) : “In Komis there was a fa
mous fire temple the founder of which is unknown, called xuris ; they say,
Alexander, having conquered it, did not permit to destroy it and to ex
tinguish the fire.” The name frambar means pell-mell.® Ptolemy has
^{a}paii^apa, his source being the Bematists of Alexander. The place
is the oil-sources of Sh^kuh i bala, less than 20 miles north-northeast
of Damghan, capital of Komis, Hecatompylos of Alexander’s time. Not
far to the north is the natural marvel of the Tang i Shamshirburr,

III was murdered.
The palace of the Vefikan, “the manor-house Winter’s Gate,” thus
lay near north of Damghan through which passed the great highroad
from Raga to Tosa. ^ahr.Er. §i8; “sahristan e Kdmis . . . manis[n] e
pahlavikan anod but, town Komis : there was a residence of the Pahla
vikan,” meaning the Vefakan, cf. Moses of Chorene [in Hiibschmann,
Arm.Gramm. 63] : “These are the pahlavik kings: Arsak . . . , Arsavir,
who had three sons and one daughter: Artases, Karn, Suren and Kosm
[district Komis, personified as daughter], hence the houses Karn Pah
lav, Suren Pahlav and Aspahapet Pahlav.” Similarly Tabari (Ndldeke,
437) : “Karen, Suren and Sfandiyar Pahlavi,” the last name faulty for
SpahbaS. The group is frequent in the Sasanian inscriptions. In reality,
Tos belonged to the SpahbaS (see under ‘Notarya’) and Komis to
the Vefikan. The Armenian confounds them because at the time of
the Arab conquest, the Karen bore the title “spahbaS i Xurasan, saS
[<Xseta] of Padisxvargar [Komis] and Gel Gelan.”
The great highroad from Raga through Komis to Tosa, the Khura
san road of the Arab geographers, had been constructed during the
Achaemenian period as a post-road, see under ‘Post and Travels.’ Ban
ished from Raga by the sentence confirmed by Cambyses, Zoroaster fled
through Komis, residence of the Vehviya, to Tosa where Vistaspa was
satrap. That is the “rzus pa^o, the straight road” of the gathas on which
he traveled in his vaza, the two-horse coach. I have made the long 500
miles on horseback, and once drove from Raga to Komis in the month
of prta.zimo, through deep snow, shivering with cold.
In these verses, again, although the picture is full of life, the style of
the poet is not descriptive, but causative. This affects even the use of the
names (see under ‘Poetry’). Where names of other great families
appear, he calls himself not merely Zoroaster, but uses his family name.
The obtrusive contrast of the family names Vehviya and Spitama in
Y.51,12 means entirely true to his style: “a Vehviya, a kavi like myself,
has refused hospitium to me, a Spitama!” That is the crime against
Rtam, the mores.

Nyberg loves comparisons, for instance 357, speaking of the identifica
tion of the two Vistaspa; “Wenn dies moglich ist, so kann man eben
sowohl Karl XII von Schweden mit Karl II von Spanien oder Wilhelm
von Hohenzollern mit Wilhelm von Oranien gleichsetzen!” The em
peror William may have asked himself in iprS: “Will the lady of
Orange, the queen, receive me, William of Hohenzollern?” Thus
speaks Zoroaster, explaining, not describing. As a Spitama he hopes to
find refuge first with the kavi Vehviya, then with the haxamanis kavi
Vistaspa, himself a kavi, as the grandson of the last kavian great-king
of Media.



XIV. POST AND TRAVELS
“Non quasi mansoria dilectio et dilectatio sed transitoria potius tanquam viae, tan
quam vehiculorum.”

S. Augustinus, De Doctr. Christ.
The royal Achaemenian post had an old history, going back to high
Babylonian antiquity; but its organization over the whole empire and
for a long duration is due to Darius. Not only the Greeks, but also later
Persians report it.^
The loanwords, Gr. ayyapo^ “courier, letter-carrier” in Herodotus
111,126, Xenophon Cyrop. viii,6,i7: ayyap-qiov “the post,” Her. 8,98;
ayyapov mjp “fire signals,” Aeschylus Agatn. 273, have not yet been
ascertained in Iranian; their origin is, with Landsberger, Akk. egirtu
“letter, message.”^
Aristotle, de mundo, BerLAk. f® 398, mentions the light-telegraph:
specularii excubitores qui ignes edere praenuntios et tollere e speculis
soliti sunt. Fire signals were used in Iran in pre-Median antiquity.
Sargon, 8th Camp. (714 b.c.) 11.2491!., Thureau-Dangin : “pour faciliter
leur observation de la province sur les pics des montagnes des tours,
dimate, etaient construites et se dressaient . . . qidat abri sa sepe° nakri
ullu (s’agit-il de ‘feux’.?) . . . matin et soir ils regardaient, puis faisaient
connaitre. . . .” Luckenbill 11,163: “To . . . the look-outs of the districts,
towers were constructed on the summits of the mountains and set up to
. . . the fire of brushwood, by which means they saw the approach (lit.
feet) of the enemy from a great distance, morning and night, and made
it known to. . .”
Ayat\.Zar. §3: “On the mountains and highest summits let them
light fires, announce [azd kun, by azdakara, heralds] to the empire,
announce by couriers, biyaspan : Except the magi attending the fires, no
male between 10 and 80 shall stay at home!”
The towers called dimate in Assyrian are meant in the verses ¥^.10,45,
on Mithras lookout men, by the words:
vispahu pati brzahu vispahu viSayanahu
on all mountains, on all viSayana.
^ E.g. ibn al-Balkhi, Fdrsn., p.56, under “Dara i buzurg b. Bahman.” - Cf. “d77apto, bondage, corvee'’ under ‘Social Structure.’



POST AND niAVELS 225
In 46, the lookout men are called spas viSetar.^ In Mithra is
“pr^u.viSayana, outlooking far and wide,” i.e. over the whole earth,
not “auf breiter Warte Y/.i4,i3: The he-camel stands “vidi
d(i)va, looking to and fro like a sastar, commander.”
These towers were erected along the roads, also above the entrance
and at the corners of caravanserais, and serve for observation of traffic
and military purposes. The Arabs call them mil or burdj,* which be
longs to viSayana as to type, to brzah as to etymology. Tabari, when
speaking of Afshin’s campaign against Babak, early 9th century a.d.,
describes flag- and fire-signals ; the signal troops are called “kuhbaniyya,
mountain-guards,” the towers dayadiba, pi. of didban <*deta.pana.
Arm. det, to Vdi- like vi.dayana. I have noted such watch-towers on
my map in “Paikuli” along the old Turco-Persian boundary; another
series can be seen between Teheran and Kum along the salt-desert.
Carrier-pigeon post, too, is said to be of Persian origin, but I know
only of much later reports. Pigeon towers—for guano, not for post
characterize the landscape around Isfahan. A poem of Khadidja, daugh
ter of al-Ma’mun (Aghani 14,114) speaks of these burdj lil-hamam, and
the 1001 Nights (ed. Cairo 3,101, night 698) tell of the cunning Dalila:
“Her husband had been barradj (inspector of the pigeon-towers) with
Harun al-Rashid, with a salary of a thousand gold-pieces a month; he
bred carrier-pigeons that fly with letters and messages, and each of these

Dalila gets the office as reward for her ingenious pranks. That is really
true to life.—Ibn Shaddad, in ibn Shihna’s “durr” p.75: “The Mongols
under Hulagu had destroyed the citadel of Aleppo at the first conquest,
Febr. 1260; after returning from Palestine, they found that a pigeon
tower had been built there, declared that to be a breach of treaty and
under this pretext destroyed the citadel completely in February-March
1261.”

the section beyond Susa, the dfia^irrj 686? from there to Persepolis is
mentioned. These causeways were surveyed and provided with mile
stones, parasangs. So was the Great Trunk-Road of India, mentioned
by Megasthenes. Ctesias, in Diodor. 2,1,5, tells Semiramis had built
such a highway from Babylon to Agbatana, Kp-jy/rvou? Kara Koifjacra
KotXou? TOTTou? ^wtrao-a, leveling the eminences and filling the depres
sions, “in order to leave an immortal monument, and it is called to the
present time Se/xtpd/xtSo? 686?,” a designation in which Semiramis
must be substituted for a Persian word similar to, or equivalent of, the
name of the queen. Ctesias’ words strikingly resemble Isaiah 40,3-4: “In
the desert clear the way of yhwh, make straight a high road for your
God in the ‘arab^ah. Every valley shall be raised, and every mountain
and hill made low; and the crooked shall become straight and the rough
places a plain.”^*’
“King’s road, girru sarri” is already an Assyrian terra, e.g. in San
herib’s texts, and it lives on as appellative. Ammian Marc. 23,1: “At
Carrhae the road to Persia branches in two viae regiae, laeva (via
Nisibis) per Adiabenam ( = Assyria proper) et Tigridem, dextera per
Assyrios ( = Sas. asuristan, Babylonia) et Euphratem.” In the parable
of the five gates, MirMan.11,14,,2.1 (T.Pars.) we read: “like a man who
travels with many treasures on the king’s road, pd r’h ‘y bg rft.” Hen
ning translated “auf sicherem.? Wege,” but “bg, god” is here royal
title, as in IParsik; on the contrary, “by” is the number 2 in by’sp’n, the
epithet of Mani, usually translated “god’s messenger.”—On the pass of
Taq i Girra, the “Zagros Gates,” a point of the “Semiramis road,” where
Antiochus III, in 220 b .c. had crucified Melon, the dismembered body
of St. Pethion was exhibited : “the crowd was so large because the ‘road
of the great-king’ passed at the foot of the mountain: this road goes to
the utmost confines of the kingdom.” In a.d. 800, al-Asma‘i says of the
great poet abu l-‘Atahiya: “His verses are like the ‘king’s road, sahat al
muluk,’ upon which fall jewels, gold, earth, potsherds and date-stones.”
And still today sah rah, rah i sah is the word for great highways.

The much discussed words in Esther 8,14 are: r6k®be ha.rakas ha.
“hakTanim b^ne ha.r'makim.
rok^be are the Akk. rakbu, ra.gab “riding couriers”; cf. the unclear
passage of the kudurru L.W.King n“ vii, where a mar Hanbi receives
from a courtier, res sarri, as payment for arable land:
6 rak.kab sise (horses), value of 300 shekel silver,
2 rak.kab imer (donkeys), value of 50 shekel silver,
hence the first at 50 shekel, the second at 25 shekel each, while in the
same list a fully harnessed chariot is worth 100, one amurru-donkey 30,
one ox 30 shekel. If rakkab sise were “saddle-horses,” a “western saddle
donkey” would be cheaper than a “western donkey”; if rakkab were
“saddle,” a donkey’s saddle would cost half as much as a horse’s saddle,
and almost as much as a donkey, and the list would have no instance
for the value of a horse. On the other hand, 50 shekel for one saddle
horse would be in proportion to 100 for a chariot with its harness (not
including the horses themselves).
To rakas cf. the letter Harper n" 71, K.113, time of Assurbanipal,
Delitzsch Hwb. s.v. rks: sise rakkasute (adj.) mesaia (from Mesa in
Man, mod. Tashtepe) sa kaiamania urakkasuni, of doubtful meaning,

NHebr., equus mulus, whose mother is a mare, not eq. hinnus, hinny.
Comparison of 10 and 14 shows that the first place is enlarged by

at demis, the mule was asked who is your father, it replied, my mother

verse the order of the words: rok'^be ha.rakas ha.r®makim b'^ne ha.
“hsatranim, riding couriers on rakas mules, “the sons of noble mares.”
rakas r^makim and Ass. sise rakkasute may mean either saddle- or car

That the royal post used two-horse teams is shown by the Med. w'ord
for coachman, postilion : biyaspan, MP. *despan in Arm. despan, Arab,
dusfan, from OIr. *dvi.aspana, lit. “two-horse-man.” At first I believed
it to mean “rider with a lead-horse.” But Arm. despak, Talm. dyspq, is
NP. du.aspah “two-horse team,” of the “royal carriage, the golden,
drawn by two mules,” according to its etymology by a pair of horses.
Arm. bastern, Lat. basterna, “sedan-chair carried by mules,” is evidently
a modern kajawah, with one mule in front, one behind, for it is *dva.
astarana. Also the Roman post used pairs, M.Lat. reda < Celt, deriad =
biga.
Zoroaster uses “ra^ya” for the road, Y.50,6-7: “AhuraMazdah . . .
will point out the rules, to be a ra^ya for my tongue.” ra^ya > rah is
the track of the chariots in the circus, then a carossable road. As the
passage in Isaiah shows, the conception of the rzus pa^o “the straight
roads on which AhuraMazdah dwells” in Y.35,6 and more often, is
derived from the great highways. And it was on the longest and oldest
highway of Asia, which was measured by Alexander’s bematists,
described by Isidorus of Charax for C. Caesar and by the Arab geog
raphers as the “Great Khurasan Road,” that Zoroaster drove, as fugitive,
from Raga by way of Komis to Tosa, with a two-horse team, vaza,
Y.51,1: “when the Vehviya denied him hospitality, him and his attend
ants, and the pair of horses, shivering with cold.” The dual vaza means
a traveling coach, and the word implies that there were ra^ya, carossable
highways, without which one could not drive in the mountainous
country.*^
The normal team of such a coach would be mules which, when

ambling steadily, cover the long distances in less time than horses do.
Alone and for short distances a horse outdoes a carriage, but where there
are roads, in the long run, the carriage is quicker. In 1924, when sud
denly called to Teheran, from Shiraz, Firuz Mirza Farmayan told me
that his ancestor, Agha Muhammad Khan, in 1779, covered that dis
tance of 600 miles in three days, and thereby won the throne.
Gr.Bdh. 210, description of the mythical Kang: “ke ac dar o dar pat
asp xxii roc u pa vahr' xv roc sayet raftan, from gate to gate it is a
travel of 22 days on horseback, of 15 days in a coach,” hence three or
two weeks. Driving was reckoned to be quicker by the half than riding.
In Yr.5,4 (= Y.65,4) the circumference of a sea is given as “ca^war
satam ayar.baranam huvaspai nare baramne, 40 days’ journey to ride
for a well-mounted man,” and the Gr.Bdh. reduces this distance to
1,900 farsangs, another number for infinite.
Another term of postal affairs is parvanag. Maj. al-Ulum 64: “al
furaniq are the carriers of the post-bags, for (Ar.) khadim is in Pers.
parvanah.” parvanak, therefore, is a deriv. of MMed. parvan, corresp.
to MPars. pes, “coram, in adspectura”; parvanak, or pesenik, cf. pese
nikan salar in Aydt\.Zar., is “officer, servant in waiting.” Qudama, 184:
“It falls to the duty of the sahib al-barid, postmaster, to superintend
the service of the farwanaqiyyin, and he must control the ashab al
khara’it.” kharita is post-bag, then money-bag. Ibn Khurdadhbih,i53;
in his description of the post, says, the furaniqin are placed under the
yanadira, chiefs of the stations. Mir.Man.\\,y,\\ \ “Men need a parvanag
and rahnamudffi who shows them ‘r’h v vdr, way and passage’ (Aw.

Arab, barwanah, defined by Quatremere as “ministre” and “chambel
lan, hadjib”; cf. van Berchem, Inscr.Arab. de Syrie 88,1, where the
jfamdar Husam al-din Ladjin is a barwani: the jamdffi were diplomatic
couriers.
parvanak is not necessarily a person; it can be, like the simplex par
van, an object “in conspectu, a visa.” Salemann, Mel.As. ix, 1886, read
^ Text: “vahr u pa,” transposed; Tavadia, in Christensen Kayanides 84 proposed; “a chcval en 22 jours de printemps et cn 15 jours (d’ete).” The characters must be read v’hr, not vh’r, from Aw. vrta or varta, spelled vasa.

parvanak in Mat.Catr. where the Bombay edition presents “fravartak,
letter.” The Pers. glossaries give it the meaning “hukm, decree” or
“farman, rule, patent” of the government.* D. Hoshang Jamasp trans
lated it by “pass, passport” in his glossary, and as such the obsolete word
has been revived in the latest NP. to replace Ar. djawaz. Pahl.Vid.

tovan, from Kisvar to Kisvar, except with a divine passport, visa, one

Apollonios of Tyana, middle of the ist century a.d., traveling from
Agbatana to India, says; “The guiding camel bore a golden tablet on
the forehead, as a sign for all they met with, that the traveler was one
of the king’s friends and traveled with royal authorization.” Twelve
hundred years later, Marco Polo describes the Mongol “paizah,”® e.g. in
China “silver tablets with: Our imperial order for post-horses, urgent”;
under Ghazan Khan in Iran; “bronze tablets for persons traveling in
official mission with post-horses.” A few gold and silver paizah are
preserved in the Hermitage.^®
The usual word for traffic, traveling is “Vcar-, versari, circulate,”
cf. under ‘Hellenism,’ the edict of the Byzantine autokrator in ¥^.9,24:
“not shall, henceforth, an a^ravan (fire priest) travel, carat, in my
country!”
y.62,8: The Fire observes the hands of all “para.carantam, passing
travelers” : “what present has the friend for his friend, the traveler, fra.
car^want, for him who sits quiet, arme.saSe.” The Pahl. transl. is
armek, a word in which this armezd and armeka “still-standing” have
coalesced. MP. armest means in general “sick, invalid,” e.g. in Pahl.
Fzi.5,59; 7,19; their place is the armekan gah, Pahl.Vid.g,^2>^ Aw.
arime gatu. This word does not contain the notion “isolation”—any
more than does vitrta.tanu \Wb.: “wobei der Leib, die Person (an

unable to move, invalid. The armestan gah is a “house of invalids,” the
bimaristan of later times, “hospital,” and Islam has taken over the
institution at the very earliest period from Iran.
The comp, a.car- means “to alight, to put up (at a station).” Y/.io,

13,49: “If a couple want to put up, cara, in this house, they shall not
forbid them, apa.roSaya^^ to do so.” About 1903, in a hotel in Patras,
was written: “Messieurs les voyageurs sont pries de ne pas introduire
ici des demoiselles avec lesquelles ils ne sont pas legitimement maries,
jusqu’a II heures, apres quoi ils paieront le double.”
From Vcar-, finally, comes *vaicara, vrddhi of *vicara, MP. vacar,
NP. bazar, “market, trade, ‘Handel und Wandel.’ ” I formerly followed
Bailey who combined Kurd. Bijar with *vicara, but that placename is
rather Aw. “vicarna, bifurcation” of a road.
astah is, according to Benveniste, Inf.av. 39, “la hake, halting, resting
place, shelter”; Wb. attaches it to Vans- “anlangen, arrival.” It comes
near to Arab, manzil from nazala and marhala from rahala, and means
the mansiones or stathmoi along the post-roads, which Ctesias call “em
poria, caravanserais”; cf. the placename akaxost, 3 fars. from Marw,
Yaqut 1,277 293. One usually connects it with “aka, asti, messen
ger”; the god Naryasanha is asto. Mercury, with AhuraMazdah, also
the saviour Astvatrta is so called, as Mani is “biyaspan, courier,” but cf.
under ‘ApamNapat.’
In the Mongol period the term for the post-houses, which originated
from the Iranian institution, is yam, yam, yamb. Jam, Jam, a word
spread over the whole of Asia and Russia. I discovered it once in the
inscription of the khan Ortmah in Baghdad, which is the only such
building known to exist, under the Arab, form yam < OP. ‘yurnan,
gen. *yumnah (attested by the deriv. OP. yaumani) to Vyu- “to put

says KaraXvcret? “place of unharnessing,” Germ, “ausspann = halting
place,” while relais and relay are lit. “Anspann,” cf. AltpJnschr. 365
and Arch.Reise 11,1871!. The postmaster is called, already at the end of
the Sasanian period, yundar, Arab. pi. yanadira, , in Ibn
Khurdadhbih, 153, with wrong points, banadira, , also sev
eral times in Tabari. It is the Old Turk, loanword yamtar.

Qudama, 241 : “In Kaskar was a canal called janb, and the track of
the post-couriers to Maisan . . . was on the area of its southern bank”;
later, when the bata’ih became swampy, the swamps on the side of the
post-road, tariq al-barid, were called “adjam al-barid, post-swamps,”
the other side, in Nabataean, “agme rabta, i.e. al-adjam al-kubra’, the
great swamps.”
The mamluks had a numerous corps of pages, called al-khassakiyya,
from which came all their officials and even the sultans themselves.
Whether khassah be genuinely Arabic or not, at any rate the Persian
formation khassaki proves the institution to come from the Seldjuq
court in Isfahan. Many of these pages were jamdar, or barwani—like
the above mentioned Husam al-din—^and served as diplomatic couriers,

nimg-appearance” of an ecstatic “Erscheinung-phenomenon” is the
wrong translation of “hvafna, sleep” by “trance,” see under ‘Yama.
The verses of Y-33,5 are a metaphor: life as traveling, the cammin
di nostra vita, or death as journey to heaven. Cf. Y.32,15: “they shall
drive, bryante, lit. be driven (in a coach), to the house of Vahumano.”
The Qur’an 39,73 says; “Those who believe in their Lord shall be
driven in multitudes to paradise, and when they arrive there, the
gates shall be opened and their keeper says: Hail! you were good, enter
for evermore!” In heaven, the roads are straighter and plainer. Zoro
aster’s “straight road” is no less “clear” than Isaiah’s “make straight a
highway for our god!” There are so many mountains in Iran—2,244
according to Y/.19—that one imagined the transfigured world to be a
perfect plain; Plutarch, de hide, 47; rrj<i Se yij? iirnreSov Kal ofiaXi}';

It is a similar metaphor, when Mani calls the spheres of the soul’s
journey vardyon, and the thought continues. In the Andarz, Testament
of Xusrau I
:
getih pa spin] dar u tan pat ast (’.st.n < ’.s’n.n)
nevkih pa krt' dar u bazak pa roc spoz^®

Full of difficult readings and hardly correct, meaning: “Regard the
world as a hostel, and the body as an inn, regard a good deed as a
completed
a
sin as a delayed day’s journey, the heaven as to be made
your own! (your very goal).”
Similarly in Den\. M.478:
Xvataylh magavan e xvastak, xvastak magavan } e tan,
tan magavan } e ravban
where mgvn.?, as in Pahl. Texts 131: tan pa magavandih e den dastan,
must mean something like “hostel, host”: “to regard the body as the
hostel, host of the soul,” cf. under ‘Maga.’
Islam has developed the poetical metaphor into a veritable doctrine,
cf. the inscription of the Muzaffarid Shah Shudja‘ at Persepolis, ami

XV. POETRY
**Kal ffi voXvfiv'^aTnj \€VK<a\ev€ irapdeve MoO<ro avTopai W/i7re Trap* ’Evae^irjs iXaovff* eifiiviov appa” —^Empedokles
Zoroaster was a great poet. The gathas are poetry. Be there ever so
much darkness in them, the train of thought clears up with the progress
of study.
One perceives traces of IE. connections in metrics, archaic syntax,
grammatical forms and vocabulary, standing formulas and metaphors.
In some verses one can observe an imitation of the style of older passages
in the Mithra yasht; Y.ap, the “Cow gatha” is the transformation of
an older poetical theme, the “Lament of the Cow,” of which an exam
ple, incorporated in Yt.io, is preserved; the “Gatha of the Questions”
is related to “Mithras Questions” in Yt.io. Other verses, alluding to
Yama, son of Vivahvant, or to the “Twins, yama. Sleep and Death,”
presuppose that the hearers were fully acquainted with those myths,
which therefore were parts of an epopee, the primal form of which
existed before the oldest preserved parts of the Awesta.
Those are features of old tradition, in sharp contrast with an en
tirely personal style, rooted in the philosophy of the poet. The main
characteristic of his style is that he never describes, but always speaks
didactically. This we can wholly recognize only through Duchesne’s
analysis of the “explaining” Gathic compounds, in contradistinction
to the “descriptive” Awestic compounds. Zoroaster was also creative in
language : many words were certainly never used before or after in the
sense he gives them; he prefers certain forms, e.g. abstract for concrete
ones, and has created some of them. Even a superficial comparison be
tween the gatha and the Yasna haftahati is enough to show that these
qualities are personal, that all gathas bear the stamp of the same person
ality, for in the Yasna haftahati—though composed in the same dialect

all these qualities are lacking. The gathas are no popular poetry, but
one ruled by art, and are all of one and the same poet.
They themselves express this claim more than once. Y.50,6 begins:
“The man^ran who raises his voice, vacam barati, befriended, rva^a,
with rtam, after prosternation, namaha, is Zoroaster!”



POETRY 239
It has not been recognized that this is an isolated sentence and a
self-introduction of the poet, certainly a conventional formula of this old
poetry. H. H. Schaeder once called the introductory formula of the
OP. inscriptions “I, nn, the king, pleno titulo” a “self-introduction of
the kings.” There it seems to me wrong to supplement an “ahmi, I am”;
the formula rather means “In the king’s name!” similar to a Muham
medan “Bismillah!” But a connection exists between the two formulae,
and the antique fashion is maintained throughout Iranian poetry,
known to us mainly by imitations of Oriental poetry by our Roman
ticists. Hafiz mentions his name regularly at the end of his verses.
mantra means a “thing thought out, poem,” cf. Germ, denken—dich
ten. Sometimes it means “proverb,” cf. under ‘Harvatat-Amrtatat.’
man^ran is the poet, in the sense “inspired singer,’”^ not of
“prophet = rasul.” Y.Hafi. 41,5 says; “6woi stotarasca man^ranasca A.M.
ogmadeca, we are called Thy glorifiers and singers.” Once, in Y.46,3
“6wa sanstre vrne ahura,” Zoroaster calls himself “the chosen one,”
like Muhammad al-mustafa.
All poems were sung. The word for it is V vak-, as in the n.pr. man
^ravaka. That is not the “Stimme in der Ritualliteratur”—what after
all is a “voice in literature”.^—but a singing voice, “voce.” The MP.
mahrnamak is the index of a hymnbook. The Arabs render vac-, used
for the praying of Zoroastrian priests, by “zamzama, to murmur,” but
the old poets “vacam baranti, i.e. vociferantur,” sang loud like the “cock
that raises his voice at the dawn, vacim barati upa.usanham,” Vid.iS,i$;
cf. *brza.vaciya > buloc under ‘Mada-Parsa.’ Occasionally, “brzam
vacam, high voice” means “shouting,” e.g. in ¥^.10,113; 17,61; antonym
of namravak in Frhg.Ev. 3, the low, polite talk.
By his self-introduction, Zoroaster describes himself expressly as the
author, in the first place as author of gatha 50. But in most gathas, I
believe in all of them, one finds quite distinct signs of his authorship
apart from the style. All counterarguments rest upon wrong transla
tions—examples under Y.50,8—and on sophisms like the insignificant
change between first and third person, which the poet uses as he likes,
even in one and the same gatha. Meillet, l.c. 15, criticized adversely
^ Aw. +vifra, written oifra, in y/.i3,i04, where the invocation of the name of the Haugava is recommended against such “vifra and parika,” Peris, which shows that the interpolation was made at a period devoid of understanding.

the gatha which we number Y.50: “denue de caractere, fait I’effet d’une
oeuvre d’ecole”—the common brass plate in picture galleries. Such a
stylistic censure I consider as not possible in principle, and I feel that
y.50, once it is entirely understood, will take its place among the best
gathas, beside the psalm: “The heavens declare the glory of God!”
But the formula in 50,6 proves that with st.6 a new gatha begins, and
that Y.50, therefore, actually consists of two. In Y.53, likewise, a new
gatha begins with st.8. On the contrary, the end of Y.29 must not be
separated, as Andreas considered. The tradition of the gathas is amaz
ingly good, yet their arrangement is not absolutely correct. The reason
is that they were collected and arranged not according to their his
torical sequence, but to their meter, a formal point of view, similar to
the arrangement of the sura of the qur’an according to the number of
their verses.
The attempt to restore their chronological order has never been made
and would be still precocious. A few instances have been given here
under ‘Bandva.’ But Y.50,6-1 1 is better fit than any other gatha to
count as the first one. In that case, the self-introduction of the poet
would stand—a fact at all events probable—at the top of all gathas,
expressing the authorship.
Y.29,8:
ho no vasti carkr^ra sravayahe
yat hoi hudmam dyai vaxdrahya
“Zoroaster wants to sing our (the cow’s) praise. Sweetness of tongue
shall be given to him!”
sravaya, cans, of Vsru-, the verb for reciting verses, often with fra-,

syryn frsrvd, who at the foot of the wall sang a sweet song.” carkr^ra
“glory,” to “carkrmahi we praise, glorify,” also “to quote, laudare.”^
In st.7-11 the speaker does not change, as is usually assumed; it is
always Zoroaster speaking through the mouth of the “Soul of the Ox”:
“Nobody listens to Thy commandments; Zoroaster alone have we (the

aster glories in his being a poet, like Mani in being a painter.
Y.50,8:
mat va padais

mazda ustina-zasto

manaho hunartata
“With dithyrambs recited with passion I want to circumambulate
Thee, with hands outstretched, with the prosternation of one ardent
(with joy) and with the skill (gift) of Vahumano!”
Zoroaster sings here like Hans Sachs in the Meistersinger or like R.
M. Rilke “Ich kreise um Gott . . und ich weiss noch nicht, bin ich ein
Sturm oder ein grosser Gesang!” With padais I walk around Thee, my
songs walk around Thee, stretch out their hands, prosternate them
selves, are my sacrifices, “Und meine Lieder rinnen rauschend zuriick
in Ihn!”
Bartholomae: “Immer (wieder) will ich mit den Versen, die
bekannt sind als die des frommen Eifers, vor Euch treten.”
Always again the same, known verses which he had not made
himself. Lommel: “Mit Versen die erhdrt werden wegen
(meines) Strebens”—^reminds one of Faust “Wer immer stre
bend sich bemiiht . . .” Nyberg, 162: “Mit Versen, welche von
iza (= armaiti, dem Stamm) gesungen werden, umgehe (= nahe
ich mich) Euch ... die Hande ausstreckend, . . . mit den An
betung des brennenden Mannes . . . , mit guter Manneskraft.”
Interrupting an invocation of the god, a descriptive clause
“welche gesungen werden” would be a footnote of the scenario
or a sotto voce remark spoken to the audience, revealing at once
that the poet was an actor posing as prophet.
pada, metrical foot, is the same term as in the Veda. Zoroaster speaks
of something like hexameters and dithyrambs, frasruta does not mean



POETRY
242
“known” or “heard, granted”; to hear, grant, is Vx^^u-, never Vsru-,
in Gathic as in OP. When the poet “circumambulates the god with
these verses” he is the author, he cannot fool the god by presenting him
what actually is the “tribe’s.” Iza—cf. under ‘Harvatat’—belongs to
“az, desire, passion”; frasruta izaya means “recited con passione,” just
as the “prosternation of the ardent one” is one made con fuoco.
Lommel and Nyberg explain “pari.gam-, circumambulate” by “sich
nahen, to approach,” hence do not know the rite. Equally p.159, in Y.43:
“Als das (Gdttliche) mich umging (umschloss) mit Vohu Manah.”
It must be: “when the god in his quality (shape) of Vahumano circum
ambulated me.” Lommel-Andreas, to Y.43,7: “pari.gam-: ‘besuchen’
ist abschwachende Ubersetzung fiir ‘umschreiten.’ Dies, sonst Huldi
gung gegeniiber Hoher stehenden, ist von Seiten des Gottes gegen den
Propheten auifallend. Markwart und Hertel geben keine wirkliche
Erklarung . . . etwa: jemanden (mit seinem Besuch) beehren.” In mod.
Persian every visit is a “bringing and carrying away of honor, tasrif
awurdan and burdan,” but such a phrase can of course be used only by
the one honored, not even the Shah could say that in the first person,
let alone one who prays to his god. Hertel understands the words per
fectly, Beitr, 240 and iiqf viijipi, and refers for Y.51,20 to the Rgveda. In
Y.43, the “Gatha of the Vision,” AhuraMazdah in his aspect as Vahu
mano circumambulates the prophet five times, asking and answering
questions. This rite means a worshipping of Zoroaster by the god, and
Markwart described Zoroaster there as Arhat, very much to the point
and better than Nyberg’s “pneumatischer Mensch.”
In Buddhist India the rite is called pradakfina. The Sasanian fire
temples were planned for the same ceremony of circumambulation of
the fire as are the modern temples. Already the pre-Islamic Arabs
circumambulated the cella of the Nabataean temples and the Ka‘ba,
calling it tawaf. Aghani.ig,'^^- “The poet ‘Ali b. ‘Abdallah al-Dia‘fari
al-Talibi told: Once a woman passed me at the tawaf of the Ka‘ba,
while I was just reciting to a friend my verses: ‘I love the religion with
eagerness, but I love the worldly pleasures not less. What am I to do
with such a mind, can holy and worldly love be combined.?’ Just then,
the woman turned to me and said: Let one of them go and keep the
other, no matter which one!” In Shi‘ite Iran and ‘Iraq, the tawaf is

1,85, 11,52 and Arch.Hist.lr. 93.
ustana.zasta: Ved. uttana.hasta is used in a similar way; it is Au
Xetpa? dvacrxcov- The outstretched, open hands are of course the
gesture of imploration. Duchesne, Comp.av. 221 says: “Est employe dans
les gatha . . . avec une signification precise: la strophe 50,8 est un
abrege de liturgie: I’office rituel comporte geste, ustana.zasta v.2;
parole, ardrahya namaha v.3; pensee, vahos manaho hunartata V4;
cf. y.28,1 ustana.zasta designant le seule acte materiel admis dans le
culte Reforme [Meillet’s term for the true Zoroastrism], resume, en
quelque sorte, une doctrine a lui seule.”
V nam-, MP. namaz, is “to bow, down to the soil,” salutation to men
of higher rank, as Herodotus describes, called proskynesis by the Greeks.
The MP. ideogram is SGDH = Arab. sadjada for the same posture in
praying. Thus, namah is another gesture of praying, whilst hunartat
is every skill, art, here poetry. Even when these words do not represent
“parole” and “pensee,” Duchesne’s description of the formula as “doc
trine” and “office rituel” stands, ustana.zasta is a Zoroastrian gesture
of prayer; on the other hand, Atar in Y.62,1, Mithra in are in
voked “esma.zasta barsma.zasta go.zasta havana.zasta, with fire-wood,
barsman, milk and mortar in hand”; to Anahita one prays, in Y/.5,98
with barsman in hand, and, since the goddess herself holds in YA5,i 27
the libation cup, ^batiyaka and barsman in her hand, probably with
hydria or phiale for the zo^ra.
hunartat is not the “Manneskraft des brennenden Mannes,” ambig
uous, not to say equivocal, words, by which Nyberg crowns his trans
lation, but means “skill, art,” as it has always been translated, hunara
see under ‘Architecture,’ is derived from Vhu- “to produce skillfully”;
the popular etymology “hu + nar, good man”—as in Goethe’s poem
is wrong. AhuraMazdah’s activity when creating the world is called so;
Darius calls his sportly skill, Kara to crwp,a dperai, “hunara received
from AhuraMazdah” and Zoroaster his poetry “hunartat received from Vahumano.”
The whole verse is very picturesque: Zoroaster executes the divine
service according to his own rite by circumambulation, out-stretching
of the arms and prostration, and his songs are his sacrifices, yasna, as
he calls them in the first verse. In the same way he says in Y.51,22: “To

whom, for my sake, A.M. through [the mouth of] Rtam has destined
paradise as reward for their worship (sacrifice), those ... I want to
circumambulate with songs of praise!” (text under ‘Maga,’ commentary
under ‘Deva’). The last words mean an adoration of his helpers.
In Y.46, 16-17, under ‘Hospitium’—the situation is: The two
Haugava, Frasaustra and Zamaspa, set forth on their journey to the
place “where obedience to the law, armatis, follows right, rtam, where
power, xsa^ra, is in the possession of the good-will, vahumano, and
where AhuraMazdah dwells in abundance (or “joy”), vardm^n.”^ Like
the following sentences, this description of the purpose of the journey
is a wish: where justice ought to be found, the highest court, the great
king himself. The purpose of the journey was to obtain the frasastis,
the revocation of Zoroaster’s banishment. At their departure Zoroaster
sings “in Zamaspem et Prexostrem legates Agbatanam proficiscentes”
:
“You, Frasaustra, go there, ardrais tais yan usvahi usta.stoi!” “ardent,
aglow” are here, once more, not the travelers, but Zoroaster’s wishes,
the word for which is “usta.stoi, inshalllh!” “Both our, i.e. Zoroaster’s
and the Haugavi’s ardent wishes for your success accompany you, my
father-in-law!”
St.17:

Lommel-Andreas: “(dort) wo ich eure Verdienste verkiin

Bereitwilligkeit (dem verkunden), der den frommen und den

Silben fehlen; Henning erganzt a^ra vor ya^ra. afsman ‘Ver
dienst,’ anafsman, das Gegenteil, so auch Kent, Language iv,
io6f.” I wonder whether somebody else can find rhyme and
reason in this translation, according to which Zoroaster, by
passing over the “guilt” in silence, would tell in Zamaspa’s
favor a half-truth to his god, who through his adviser. Truth,
knows better. Bartholomae translated: “wo ich eure Nachteile
melden will, nicht eure Vorteile,” the way Arab satirists used
to threaten their victims with a satirical poem.
With srosa as noun, the construction, if possible at all, is very
difficult. Tedesco saw the solution: srosa is s-aor. of \/sru-, i.p.
aor.act., cf. Grdr. §373, and the med. srosani in §156, xsnavisa
in §157. The first sentence means: “I must remain at home and
can only express my wishes in poems.” afsman or afsman is
the “chain,” the term for the verse consisting of pad. noit an.
afsmam, with double negation—stronger than the positive
“not non-verses” are really good ones. Cf. Y.46,8: “hujyatois
noit duzjyatois, good-life, real good-life.” In order to judge the
verses one must be able to distingish between da^am and
ada^am. These words may refer to something that would make
the Haugava especially fit for his mission (see under ‘Hospi
tium’), but the parallelism between the two pairs of words with
negation is so obtrusive, that one must relate the neutr. da^am
to the “verses.” Zoroaster calls Zamaspa a “learned” man who
knows what education or lack of education (or skill and lack
of skill) really means, calls him a Dr. jur et phil.
As to etymology, Bartholomae, Grdr. §33 attached afsman to Vpas-,
Tnjyvvfii, Lat. pangere (versus).® The composing of poems is also
called “to weave,” and Gath, vafus is “carmen,” thus in Y.43,8 and 28,3:
yo va . . . ufyani . . . aparviyam, I want to make poems to Ahura
Mazdah as never before!” as good as never verses have been “woven”
to him. The same etymology is the best one advanced for Gr. hymnos.
The word for “strophe” is “vaca.tasti, i.e. voces + texere, like sermones
^ The spelling with s in y.46,17, with s in Awestic, makes no difference; the Pahl.transl. for both is the same, with right: patman. not a “Verwechslung,"

246
texere.” Andreas’ objection, in nggw 1931, 111,315, is difficult to under
stand: “Bartholomae’s Kombination von ufyffiii mit dem verbum des
Webens wird dem Sinn nicht gerecht.” The tertium is the artificial
joining of the words, like threads in weaving a pattern. In just the
same way “hazar.baf, thousandfold-woven” is the term for artificial
assemblage of bricks. Gath, afsman, too, means the “chain” (opp. weft)
of the weaver’s loom. The figurative expression has analogies in all
languages. The Aramaeans “weave, zaqar” the speech, the Romans’
speeches and letters. They use also “faber,” as Germanic languages “to
spin” and “to forge.” Abu l-‘Atahiya, the poet, when asked whether
he was really a potter, answered : “I am a rhyme-potter, my brother is a
potter by trade.”
Certain expressions of this poetical language, e.g. addresses, belong
to a “courtly” style and are significant for the “Horatian” character of
these carmina: instead of the direct pronouns derivatives in -vant are
used.
Y.44,1: “^wavans may tell it mavans” does not mean “one like you
to one like me,” but in Zoroaster’s causative style: “although you are so
great and I am so small, you will tell me because (I love you).” Y.44,9:
“^wavans . . . hadmoi . . . syans,” according to Lommel-Andreas “einer
wie Du, o Weiser, der mit . . im gleichen Hause wohnt” means rather:
“Your Highness who is dwelling in the same house.” Or Y.43,3: “(ar
dro) ^wavans hozantus spanto mazda, of the same kind, essence, as
Your Highness, holy!” The derivatives in -vant intend to avoid the
vulgar “I” and “thou,” as recognized already by Markwart, Gath.ust.
p.63.
In Ar.Forschg. 11,155, Bartholomae called mavant (i.p.sg.) and ^wa
vant (e.p.sg.) correctly “nur Umschreibungen fiir ich und du”; Wb.
1304: “yusmavant, xsmavant, z.p.pl., nur im Sinn von Ihr’ mit Bezie
hung auf die Gbtter gebraucht”; but erroneously Ar.Forschg. 11,169:
“gemeint ist: Du, der du am besten dazu imstande bist.” The NP.
grammarians call this -vand “i tasbih (similarity) or i ziyadah (in
crease).” Here it is not similarity.
The i.pers. mavant means “my unworthy self,” thus in Y.46,7: “Who
will be given as protector, payu, to one as humble as me?” Today one
says bandah, the slave or al-faqir, the poor.” For the 2nd pers. one

2.
p.sg. by “to havand,” a.p.pl. by “smax havand.”® The word for the
3.
pers., hvavant, only in 7^.13,146, lives on in modern language. The pas
sage is a late interpolation into the memorial document and speaks of the
“mantra spanta, the revealed word,” the lieutenant, asta, of Ahura
Mazdah, which Zoroaster has allotted to men as hvavantam, Bartho
lomae “als einen wie er selber ist.” It means “as master.” The real
meaning of the passage is expressed, in a slightly different idiom, in
the Manichaean frgmt. 0278 {MirMan. ii,i8, cf. Altp. Inschr. 212)
“and they receive the nisan (a sealed mantra) from him and keep
them with such reverence, as if one would regard as his master,
something over which oneself is master, x^ys x^'d’vd.” hvavant con
tains the notion xvadavand, which itself is the same -vand derivative
of xvaday “autokrator.”
In NP. the word appears as x x^’nd [beside the comp,

its usage, not etymologically, as “sahib, master of the house.” It is

lows Quatremere, Hist.Sult.Maml. 1,67 and 96, in assuming that the
word had been introduced only after Timur, in about a.d. 1400. The
earlier use of xvandgar, as predicate of the Seljuks of Rum, disproves
that date ; this word is not a short-form, but a syn. of xudavandgar. The
address “ya x^and!” is older. al-Safadi, Ms.Berl. P lyof., says in the
biography of Yelbogha, founder of the mosque in Damascus which
bears his name: The young Yelbogha said to the sultan Nasir Muham
mad [before 741 h.] when he mentioned 20,000 gold pieces: Sire, ya
xvand, I have never seen so much money in one pile!, and the sultan
sends him that much money with the baxsis to be given to the carriers.
Yet earlier, the word appears in the biography of Shirkuh, ibn Khal

son of nasir al-din Ibrahim of Hims, explained to ibn Khallikan at
Damascus, in 661 h., how he got his name: “My father received the
news of my birth returning from the campaign in Anatolia, in ramadan
® This havand is Aw. “avant, tantus,” used with correl. yavant or civant, which Bartholomae considered as possible neologisms, whilst he remarks to the same, merely aspirated havant of Vid. and Nir. “eigti. ihm ahnlich.”

627 (July A.D. 1230) and said to al-ashra£ Musa “Sire, ya x^and, you
have one slave more!”; the sultan answered: “Call him after my name!”
Therefore these Kurds, the Ayyubids, brought the word with them,
which they certainly had learned at the Seljuk court. The meaning has
not changed in the 1,700 years from Cyrus to Saladin.®®
There is also “servus,” e.g. Y.32,1: “^woi dutaho ahama, we want to
be Thy servants!” see imder ‘Axmatis.’ And y.29 ends, emphatically,
with the words of the “soul of the ox”: “Invite us to the wedding,
ahama ratois yusmavat^!, we want to be among the servants of Your
Highness!”
The opposition of greatness and own humbleness appears also in
verses like Y.49,12:
kat toi rta
zara^ustrai
yo va stotais
avat Jasans
zbayantai avaho
kat toi vahu manaha
mazda frinai ahura
yat va ista vahistam
“How little would it matter to Thee, as Rtam, to Thee as Vahumano,
to help Zoroaster who is imploring Thee, me, who wants to please Thee
with songs of praise, only asking for something that, as the best, is in
Thy power!” That means, what is the best for me and an easy matter
to you.
Bartholomae: “Was fiir Hilfe hast Du, o Asa, was Du, o
Vohu Manah, fiir mich, den Zarathustra, der ich rufe ? der ich
mit Preisliedern um Eure Gnade werbe, o M.A., nach dem
verlangend, was in Eurem Besitz das beste ist.?” Most exacting.
Lommel: “Was hast Du durch das Wahrsein, was hast Du
durch das Gute-Denken an Hilfe fiir den Zarathustra, der
(Dich) anruft, der ich Euch, o Weiser Herr, durch Lobpreisun
gen erfreuen will, um das bittend, was nach (entsprechend)
Eurem Wunsche das Beste ist (oder: was Eure begehrtesten
Giiter sind?).” Note: “Andreas betrachtete ista als instr.sg.,
vgl. Ai. ista- n., ‘Wunsch,’ ebenso Y.46,16: wo das xsa^ram
entsprechend dem Wunsche—^ista—des VohuManah ist.”

Persian the king is addressed with “qurbanat misavam,” or simply “qurban,” may I be th> sacrifice, offering, exactly as in Kassitc, fourteenth century b.c. “ikribu,” and at the same time the scribe Marduk.muballit calls himself “kiribtu sa ili u sarri, consecrated to the god and the king,” viz. Assur.uballit of Assur.

“kat toi” is NP. ba-tu ci?, what does it matter to you?, or
“what concern is it of yours ?” The instrumentals are instr. of
quality “you (in your quality) as Vahumano.” avaho is gov
erned by kat—cf. Y.50,1: kat moi under ‘Haugava’—this in the
sense of “quantillum,” but put behind zbayantai, for which an
avahe must be supplied from avaho. Cf. Quran 19,21, legend
of Miryam: “huwa ‘alayya hayyinun, it is an easy matter for
Him.” Therefore, ista is the normal “have power over.”
Bartholomae translated Y.46,5: “es wird ihm AhuraMazdah das
(zweite) Leben schenken”; Lommel: “und ihm wird der Weise Herr
das Leben geben, er wird ihm durch Gutes-Denken Vieh und Leute
fordern.” Both fail to hit the character of the sentences: Zoroaster
“weaves” into his verses the ancient beggar’s cant: A.M. shall give him
life! Mazda dadat!,=;i^uda bidihad! Allah ya’tik! God will give you!
Mazda ahum dadat = Allah yutawwil ‘umrak!, God make your life

of course not the “second”—long!. Aw. drgajyati and hujyati. A.M.
as Vahumano shall increase his property and family! Mazda ge(9a
fradat! = Allah yu’ammir baitak! The Sasanian epistolary guide, Na
mak nipisnik, says derzivisnih e Jan ut apatih e her, or derzivisn u
Xvastak, long life of soul and flourishing of possessions, long life and
wealth! Spanish: salud y pesetas!
Andreas translates Y.32,9: “Mit diesen Worten, die der Ausdruck
meiner Gesinnung sind, o Mazda”—^I’expression de mes sentiments

one cannot help going on “I have the honor to be yours truly,” and
the verse actually contains something of such polite phrases of an epis
tolary guide, highly developed in the Nam.Nip.—All these things come
under the category of “narma.vak, MP. apatgowisn, NP. narmgoy,
cultivated, polite, courtly speech.”
One can include Y.33,5 (see under ‘Post and Travels’) : “I, who wants
to call forth your most-high Sroso at the stage.” Sroso is subaltern,
most-high only as servant of the Most-High. For exactly this reason,
Xusrau I, the Theos, calls his ambassador (Menander, Exc. de
^1)3)- There is nothing “divine” about the ambassador himself.
The same style is also Byzantine.
Among the ancient traditional patterns of this poetry are the meta

phors taken from racing, often conforming to metaphors in the Veda
and in Homer. On our understanding of them depends much besides
the Iranian conception of the “aeons,” discussed at the beginning under
‘Chronology.’
The Husravah legend, ¥^.5,50 (=19,77) speaks of a race-course:
yat vispanam yu^tanam that of all teams
azam fratamam ^an]aya(ni) I may drive the foremost
ana '‘tacartam^ yam drgam along the long race-course

rzura > NP. lur; the place is to be looked for in Luristan, the region
famous for the Nesaian horses. Nine rounds are the maximum, as the
tablets of Kikkuli of Mitanni describe it, see under ‘Chronology’ : navar
tane vaz‘ anasaia. One circuit of the course is a rvesa, etym. = Gr. pot/cd?
and assuming all connotations of Gr. kvkXo?, “round, course, cycle.”
‘aspa.rvesa > NP. aspres “hippodrome.” Another term is “^warsali,
section,” whence on the one hand ^warsah as term for the nine millen
nia of the world’s history, on the other the nine ^warsah of the “var i
Yamkirt.” pati.prtati is “compete, contest.”
The MP. term for the paradisiac condition after the end of the world,
“apatiyarakih, being-no-longer-contested,” and the old word frasam
always with ellipsis—“beyond (contest by evil)” are taken from the
races: the ninth and last turn round the ‘meta’ is the image of the
ninth and last millennium. When the victorious chariots go through
the goal, all shout: YTahi!, triumph! To Lat. meta Gr. “terma” corre
sponds, and “meta vitae, terme de la vie” is the universal metaphor.
From the time of Kikkuli and Husravah to the present day, the style
of the yearly races for testing the Turcoman and Arab horses at
GiimiisTepe near Astarabad in Hyrcania has not changed. One races
round the course three, five, seven, and nine times, navartane, only
one no longer drives chariots, but rides on horseback. The nine rounds
measure together one double parasang or about seven miles. The course,
of necessity, is an elongated ellipse, the spina of which measures about

700 yards. One tacara, the length of one round, hence would be over
1,400 yards. Frhg.Ev. 27a says: “bis etavat ha^ram yavat tacaram, two
lengths of a ha^ra equal one tacara,” and the ha^ra is determined as
“M gam e do pay, 1,000 paces at 2 feet,” which gives the ha^ra exactly
the normal length of the spina and the tacara the double of it.
The old myth of Yama’s var describes the four sides of this castrum
as I tacara long; this is actually the size of the qasr Balkuwara in
Samarra. F/^.2,25, there, writes “i cartu.drajah,” Pahl.Vid. “aspres
drahnad, one race-course long,” with note: “=2 hasr.” The archetype
must have had tsrtv', with s for c and v in the joint of the compound,
read Yacarta.drajah. Tazar remains a placename; one of them, which
the early Arabs mention near Dastagird Xusrau, is called hippodromos
by the chroniclers of Herakleios.
Another word for race-courses is NP.-Arab. maidan, used, like tazar,
as placename. Many towns had several maidan in front of their gates;
Aleppo e.g. had four or five, and besides a quarter aspres. Ibn Shaddad
describes a column there, the meta of the antique hippodrome, the shape
of which one can imagine from the remark that it had the power of
healing urinal troubles. In Iran, the double posts of polo-gates are
always phalloid, e.g. the oldest ones preserved on the largest and most
beautiful maidan, the one in Isfahan. This maidan, at present the center
of the town, was before the Arab conquest outside the south-gate of the
old City of Gay, as the name of this gate, bab aspres shows.®
Thus, aspres and maidan are synonyms, and both are Iranian words.
OIr. maitana appears as placename in the list of 45 Median chiefs in
the Hamadan region who bring tribute to Sargon, when he added the
region to his province Parsua, with the seat of administration in Har
har-Nihawand; Prism A: ‘’is.te.li.ku and ‘’a.di[r.?]ri.pa.ar.nu, bel alanF*

reached when leaving the Iranian mountains—“hippodrome,” as the

var.
Not a few metaphors in the gatha refer to the races.
Y.50,6:
data )^ratos hizuvo ra^iyam stoi
mahya razan vahu sahyat manaha
“AhuraMazdah, who as Vahumano has given me xratus,^' will (also)
point out the rules that shall be a way for my tongue.”
Previous translations differ only in the interpretation of razan and
sahyat. Benveniste takes the verb as absolute, the infinitive phrase as
contents of the “proclamation”: “Que ses commandements soient la
voie de ma langue!” Andreas-Lommel take raza as object, “the direc
tion,” not to razar, -"zan, but like pa 0o sah in Y.34,12; 43,3, or Ved.
anu.sas: “Damit fiir meine Zunge eine Bahn sei.” Nyberg needs “razan,
Heilige Regeln” for his “Ordalterminologie.”
The rules and the way are those of the “tongue,” the language, not
“holy,” but philological. In Y.31,19 Zoroaster says:
rz.uxSai vacaham hizvo vaso
“having full mastery of my tongue as to correct speaking of words.”
“rluxta vaxs, correctly spoken word” in Yr.11,3, see under ‘Ya-ahi!’
“vaso xsayamna,” with vaso lit. “as you like,” cf. “vaso.xsa^ra, absolute
ruler”; OP. “manaha hvepasyahya darsam xsayamna ahmi, over my
will I am severely ruling.” Full mastery of the language of poetry and
its rules means professional study of language. “Way, method,” the only
thing worth while learning and the only thing a good teacher can give
his pupil, is a figure for study the world over. Aw. ra^ya is—with
Lommel—the carriage-way in contradistinction to pa^o “foot-path,” cf.
01. “rathya, street,” MP. reh, NP. rah, der. of “ra^a, carriage.” It was
first the race-track, then the highway.
The metaphor goes on in the next stanza, Y.50,7: “I will harness for
unites power of understanding and volition.



POETRY
You the speediest racers, the . . . , the broad ones, of Your praise, the
strong ones; with them You shall reach the (winning) post, be ready
to help me!”
Bartholomae: “Ich will Euch anschirren die raschen Renner,
durch die Anregung Eures Preises, die breiten, die starken,
o A.M., mit denen Ihr herankommen sollt. Zu meiner Hilfe
macht Euch bereit!”
In Wb. 604 he remarks to “jaya, Anregung”: “d.h. sobald der
Preis der Gdtter angestimmt wird, schirrt sich ihr Wagen zur
Herfahrt.” Jayais is obscure, probably an attribute of the horses,
similar to “vika(aspa), excited at the start.” Lommel-Andreas:
, die durch die Gewalt der Euch (gewidmeten) Anbetung
breit(.?) (und) durch Wahrsein und Gutes-Denken stark
sind. . . .” In the supplement: “(das befremdliche ‘breit’) alien
falls zu stiitzen durch Sophokles, Aias, 1250: TrXaret? evpvvoi
Tot.” A. V. Gutschmid, in his review of Noldeke’s Tabari
translation, explained the surname of Shahpuhr “dhu 1-aktaf,
shoulder-man” by evpvvcoTO<;, evpv? wpoLccv, which would be
OIr. pr^uvarah. Race-horses, too, are not flat-, but deep-chested,
but the metaphor of the “song-horses,” misinterpreted by Bar
tholomae, is in fact not driven to that point. Lommel takes
mazda rta and vahu manaha, in which Bartholomae saw voca
tives, as instrumentals, but they mean, as they stand in the
verses, “(dedicated to) you Mazdah as rtam and vahumano.”
Nyberg: “Um Euren Siegespreis zu gewinnen, Mazdah mit
Asa, will ich Euch die nutzreichen, raschen, breiten, durch
Vohumanah kraftigen Renner anspannen, auf dass Ihr mit
ihnen hierher kommen moget; moget Ihr mir zu Hilfe kom
men!” And: “Der eine Wendepunkt der Rennbahn ist der
Himmel, wo die Gdtter wohnen, ... die Hymnen (Pferde)
laufen von der Erde zum Himmel, von wo sie als Preis die
Gdtter herabholen, der in den Gdttern selbst und ihrer Selig
keit besteht.” According to 303, the “Ausgangspunkt, start” of
the race course would be the “Urschdpfung,” the “Endpunkt”
the “grosse Ordal.” This concept is derived from Bartholomae’s
translation, but with a mistake: Germ. “Preis” is (i) price, (2)



254 POETRY
prize, (3) praise; the Aw. word in the text is vahma, Lat. preces,
song of praise, not Aw. mizda, Lat. praemium. The verses do
not speak of a “Siegespreis.” Moreover, the “Preis” is not won
at the “turn” which Nyberg puts in heaven, but at the goal or
post; a race course, as the names rvesa and vartana say, is of
necessity a closed curve, Herakleitos: ^vvbv yap apxfj Kal
Trepan erri kvkXov Treptc^epeia?. The tired horses do not draw
the chariot back, be it loaded with all the bliss of the gods.
Already Kikkuli describes, about 1380 b.c., how they were cared
for by their grooms, moved, washed, rubbed and fed.
The song is the chariot in which AhuraMazdah drives in the shape
of his aspects, Zoroaster’s verses are the racers, aza^a, too, must stay
inside this figure: “With them you shall arrive at, reach. . . .” The
god shall help the poet to win “im Kampf der Wagen und Gesange”
(Schiller).
Zoroaster’s songs, the gatha, are carmina or rather “odes.” Nyberg,
291: “Yasht-Dichtung ist im Kreise um Zarathustra nicht eigentlich
zu Hause.” In a circle around a poet, the center, the poet, makes the
poems. This circle was not a school of hymnbook poets of the 17th
century. “Yasht-dichtung” never existed in any circle. The Awestic
yashts are not created as such, they became liturgical yashts step by
step. If one dissolves, with the acid of criticism, the glue which the
diaskeuasts have smeared over the yasht during a long period, the
residue consists of fragments of poems and some prose pieces of vari
ous kinds, among them mythical, scientific, juridical, bucolic and mar
tial ones, and a few larger parts of hymns to gods, as they may have
been sung at many places in different ways. Sometimes, for instance in
the Mithra, Tistriya and Vrthragna yashts, one can form an approxi
mate picture of their original whole. But over against the songs of
Zoroaster they are all naive, like a folk song against a work of litera
ture.
The poet was Zoroaster, and around him there were many inca
able to do the same, and a few, able to distinguish da^am and ada^am.
The brighter Greeks, yet, called Herakleitos “dark, o-Koretvo?.” With
him, Zoroaster has much in common—as to form also with Horace,



POETRY 255
and one cannot imagine any poems that would have a better claim to
the motto: odi profanum vulgus et arceo. Therefore, although his doc
trine was officially recognized as a “community, vrzanam,” one can
only speak of a “Zoroaster community” in the sense one says “Tolstoy,
Goethe community.” The high dignitaries, all belonging to the court
and clan of Vistaspa as head of the younger branch of the Achaemenids,
are enumerated in the memorial list of y/.i3, altogether 240 names.
Zoroaster calls himself “man^ran, poet, inspired singer,” and claims
to own, beside “sweetness of tongue” just virtuosity and perfect master
ship of language. But he does not call himself “prophet” in the sense
of “rasul Allah,” God’s envoy.
The claim is justified. The gatha are works of a high art, full of ar
chaic forms acquired by study, but in style and thought entirely indi
vidual. This is a quality one rarely finds in Eastern countries, where
more artists sign their works than is usual in the Western world, and
yet their works look non-individual. Some of the good fragments in
the old yashts—the rest, even when not younger than the Achaemenian
period, is not worth mentioning—are very typical and conventional,
and would be anonymous even when the authors were known by
name. But however high and studied the art of the Zoroastrian verses
be, they are no longer “classical.” Everywhere their art is on the verge
of mere virtuosity. To use an archeological term: the gathas are
“archaisant,” not “archaic.”
Some Awestic passages flaunt their “erudition” and “correct lan
guage,” and though just these are post-Alexandrian, yet what they
express is valid for the entire redaction of the Awesta.
Y/.3,i8 and Niy.i,i6 : “hizvo danhaha man^raca vacaca syo^naca
zo^rabyasca rs.uxSebyasca vayzbyo.”
Bartholomae’s translation “mit Zungenfertigkeit . . . und mit rich
tigen Spriichen” misses the meaning (cf. WbMi danhah, 746 Vdanh-,
and 1815 hizu-). Hertel, who in Beitr. 28 says: “d.h. mit einem Lied in
awestischer, nicht mittelpersischer Sprache,” perfectly to the point, yet
translates: “mit der Gelehrsamkeit der Zunge . . . und mit leuchtend
gesprochenen Worten.” rs, in rs.uxSa, means, as always, the “correct
ness” of speech, here the grammar; and “danhah, to Vdanh-, docere”
is not rhetorical fluency of speech, but science of language, philology.

such as the bilingual or trilingual Achaemenian scribes owned, whose
serious philological studies enabled them to keep the inscriptions of
Darius free from faults—while all others are faulty. ¥^.3,18 means “with
words correctly spoken,” e.g. the instr. pi. vayzbyo of vaxs, according
to Bartholomae’s phonetic law, in contrast to rLuxSebyo.
In Y/.5,i7 and 104, and ¥^.9,26; 19,13, the expression hizvo danhaha
is also applied to the prayers of AhuraMazdah and Zoroaster, who both
therefore would have known Awestic, as the authors of these verses
believed themselves to do. They claimed to be danha, doctores, but,
as the examples prove, no longer spoke rs.uxSa, correctly. The false
topic name ’airyanam vae|o vahvya datiyaya‘ places these verses in
the time of Videvdad I, the 2nd century b.c.
I once came, a little late, to a meeting of a literary society in Teheran.
In a large reception room a poet stood on a pulpit, reciting verses in
one and the same difiScult meter with always the same rhyme. When
he had at last finished, a second stood up and continued, and then a
third. While I asked myself how such an improvisation and inspiration

eclipsing Firdausi’s examination—was possible, the chairman rose
and said: “And for our next meeting we prepare this meter and that
rhyme!” Agha Furughi expressed more than once his opinion to me
that there have been no more poets since Sa‘di and Hafiz, which would
give a period of almost 2,000 years, with one high point at the begin
ning and one at the end, and gaps in between.
The opinions about the two dialects, Gathic and Awestic, cannot be
expressed in short sentences, and have shifted much since the study of
the problem began. But in general it is still admitted today that the
Gathic dialect is older than the Awestic which continued as lingua
sacra. Unless one would assume that Gathic was an older phase of
Awestic, this would mean a change of language and would involve
problems of religious history which nobody has even tried to formulate.
The assumption of a difference in age is justified only when speaking
of the character of the dialects, in the sense in which e.g. the character
of the Baltic languages is very archaic, that of German younger, of
English still younger. But the conclusion that the Gathic songs were
older than the Awestic hymns is totally erroneous. The phase of devel
opment, the linguistic character of a dialect does not allow a conclusion
as to the date of poems composed in it. The gatha have found a place



POETRY 257
in young surroundings, the Yasna; the yasht, product of a redaction
older than the yasna but younger than the gatha, also include old parts,
and these, though in Awestic, not in Gathic, are pre-Zoroastrian, hence
older than the gatha.
Meillet, Trois Conf. 41, says on the Irish epics: “Si Ton les rapproche
des gathas . . . , on comprend d’ou vient I’obscurite et pourquoi le
vocabulaire y fait presque a chaque strophe quelque difficulte . . and
P.42S, on the lyric verses of the Greek drama and those coming near
to prose: “La difference profonde entre les deux parties est soulignee
par le fait que les parties lyriques ont une couleur dialectale qui les
separe de la langue courante.” By these analogies, Meillet described
exactly the relation of the two Iranian dialects.
Treating both dialects as living ones, as is usually done, can be main
tained only with strong qualifications. Zoroaster’s virtuosity was so
superior that he composed his songs in the learned language of an
archaic, traditional poetry. Gathic, like Homeric, has never been the
common language of any tribe or region. It is the language of poetry.
The gatha are carmina, no people and no community. Not even Zoro
aster’s name belongs to the dialect of his verses.
I wonder whether the quotations from the epics, of the stratum pre
ceding the Husravah legend, could be translated into Gathic, a problem
connected with that of the Yasna haftahati, which perhaps contains
also a few epical fragments in Gathic. The Awestic quotations are
hardly ever free of metrical and other deficiencies, which might be
cured by such a “retranslation.” That means it is not impossible that
Gathic was the language of the original Epic, and that the fragments
were transposed into Median when the quotations were inserted into
the yashts.
In the following chapter we shall study some specific terms of this
poetical language of Zoroaster, namely ya-ahl, maga, myastra and vahu
agmata, behind which one has looked for deep secrets, but which dis
close themselves as the simplest notions and therefore make plain sense
of a number of verses, incomprehensible before.



XVI. YA-AHI!
“Conquer, fortune of the Biues!*’
In Y49,9 and 46,14, also Y/.ii,3, a word ya.ahi appears, the case of
which cannot be determined; in Y.50,2, after para, we find the abl.
ya.aho; in Y/.i3,4i and Y.36,2 (=58,7) the acc. ya.aham. The stem is
considered to be yah, which W^. assumes to be the first element of the
adj. yas.krt (with compar. and superb). This adjective appears only at
very bad places of Y/.13 or worse ones, and may belong together with
yaso.brta.—^ya.ahi has no true etymological connection.
Bartholomae translates, in IFZ>. “Krise, Entscheidung, Wendepunkt,
insbes. eschatologisch von dem entscheidenden ‘Schlusswerk,’ das den
Sieg der ahurischen Welt vollenden wird.” Nyberg, 227; “Der Ausdruck
‘letzter Wendepunkt der Schopfung’ ist von der Rennbahn hergenom
men . . . fallt also mit dem yah zusammen, das Zarathustra demnachst
erwartet. . . . Man pflegt, wohl etwas zu unbestimmt, dies Wort mit
‘Krise’ zu iibersetzen. Wahrscheinlich war es ein gewohnlicher Ordal
begriff, der seinerseits den entscheidenden Augenblick der Ordal
handlung ausdriickte.” A term unknown, but congruent with a term
of sport, can “with probability” only be another term of sport.
The word has been totally misunderstood: it is no noun of undeter
minable case, but an exclamation, ya-ahi!, the inciting cry at the end
spurt of the races. When Kurds and Lurs yodel their ya-ahi-ya-ahi
today, it carries for miles from mountain to mountain.
Y.46,14:
zara^ustra kas.te rtava rva^o
mazoi magai ko va frasrudyai vasti
at ho kava vika.aspo ya-ahi!
“Zoroaster! which faithful one is your friend for the great festival?
Who wants to be praised in song? He: kavi Vistaspa, triumph!”
Bartholomae: “O Z.! Welcher Glaubige ist dein Freund fiir
den grossen Bund ? Oder wer will dass man von ihm hore ?
Das ist der k.V. bei dem Schlusswerk.”
Lommel-Andreas: “O Z.! Wer ist dein dem Wahrsein erge
bener Freund fiir die grosse (Gabe ?) und wer wiinscht geriihmt

zu werden? Nun, das ist der Fiirst V. bei der Entscheidung.”
Note: “y^i: yohi (Andreas).”
Nyberg: “Z., wer ist dir ein asa.glaubiger Mysteriengenosse
fiir den grossen maga ? Oder wer wiinscht gehdrt zu werden ?
Er, der k.V. bei der Krise.”
maga is the celebration of victory—see under ‘Maga’ ; V sru-, “recite,
praise in song” especially with fra-, as in frasrudyai, cf. frasruta in Y.
50,6. Here and in the following stanza Zoroaster speaks entirely in the
figurative language of old poetry, that drew its metaphors mainly from
the race sport.
Y.49,9:
srotu sasna ^frasanhyo suve tasto
noit rLvaca saram didans drugvata
yat dena vahiste yujan mizde
rta yu^ta ya-ahl zama.aspa
“He shall proclaim the orders, the herald destined for my salvation, who
as a duly-speaking one rejects all fellowship with the drugvant,—when
those who are harnessed to rtam shall harness the best prize of victory
to the chariot of their faith! Triumph, Zamaspa!”
Nyberg: “Moge derjenige, der sich (von Vohu Manah) bin
den lasst, der geschaffen ist heil zu verschaffen, diese vorschrif
ten horen: der recht-redende kiimmert sich nicht um Vereini
gung mit dem Drug-Anhanger, wenn die mit Asa verbundenen
ihre Schauseelen im besten Lohn bei der Krise vereinigen, o Zamaspa!”
Bartholomae translated the last sentence: “wenn die mit A.
verbundenen ihr Ich beim Schlusswerk des besten Lohns teil
haftig machen.” Lommel: “wenn sie . . . bei der Entscheidung
die geistigen Persdnlichkeiten mit dem besten Lohn verbinden.”
Markwart protested in Gath.uh. against translating savah by
“Nutzen, profit” instead of “Heil, welfare, salvation.”
suve tako : V tas- is the word for AhuraMazdah’s purposeful
creation; cf. Y.44,8: “for whom (else) hast Thou destined the
cow.^” under ‘ArmatiL’ The purpose is here suve, dat. of “su,
welfare” produced by miraculous power. As term of handicraft
Vtas- means “to timber.” suve tasto means in Zoroaster’s

exactly “a godsend.”

do not speak of Zoroaster issuing orders. The “commandments,”
sasna, are those of the government, the frasastis of the preceding
stanza, proclaimed by the herald, frasanhya. noit didans: the
negation reverses the sense of the verb: “not-wanting” means
“rejecting,” cf. Y.49,3. The “drugvant” is the bandva’s tkeso.
In the preceding stanza, Frasaustra is the fra.ista, envoy, and the ques
tion is “which hvetu will obtain the frasastis for the vrzanam?” Here,
the brother, Zamaspa, is Trasanhya, herald ; srotu, to V sru- “to praise”
replaces here Vsanh- “to proclaim,” viz. the sasna (to Vsanh-), the
order proclaimed by the frasanhya, see under ‘Social Structure’ and
‘Haugava.’
The play upon the words yujan and yu^ta shows that the original
sense, the harnessing of the horses to the “yoke,” was not lost; cf. Y.50,7,
where Zoroaster harnesses his verses to the victorious chariot. The rta
yuxta are the victors, because they are harnessed to rtam. The victor
harnesses himself, i.e. his chariot, to the prize of victory, or drives home
the prize tied to his chariot; cf. 7^.10,38, under ‘Mithra’: “the cow goes
the way of captivity on the ra^a of the thieves,” tied to their off-driving
chariot.
The verses address “those harnessed to rtam” who (lit.:) “harness
their faiths (plur.) to the prize of victory.” This moment comes when
(yat, temp.) Frasaukra and Zamaspa have obtained the frasastis, and
Zamaspa announces it as frasanhya.
Y.50,2:
srota gosais vahista avaneta suca manaha
a var na vici^ahya naram naram hvahyai tanuve
para mazo ya-aho ahmai sazdyai bodanto pati
“Hear with your ears, see with your eyes, in Good-Will, come here
to us, man by man for his own person, before the great triumph of the
decision: it shall become true in our favor, (you) who (shall) perceive
it!”
Bartholomae: “Hdret mit den Ohren das Beste—sehet es euch
an mit dem lichtesten Sinn—fiir die Entscheidung zwischen



YA-AHl! 261
den beiden Glaubensbekenntnissen, Mann fiir Mann fiir seine
Person vor dem grossen Schlusswerk darauf bedacht, dass er
es zu unserem Gunsten vollende!”
Andreas: “Horet . . . , sehet . . . , die beiden Wahlmdglich
keiten, die zur Entscheidung stehen, indem ihr darauf achtet,
dass jedermann fiir seine Person uns vor dem grossen Entschei
dungskampfe gefalle!”
Nyberg: “Das grosse yah in Y.30,2 ist das grosse Ordalurteil:
Horet . . . sehet mit brennendem Sinn (manah) das Beste;
kommt hierher zu uns zur Entscheidung, Mann fiir Mann [ein
jeder] fiir seine Person, darauf bedacht, es fiir uns vor der gros
sen Krise (yah) zu vollenden!”
These translations are at variance mainly in the conception
of b: Bartholomae: a varna; Andreas: avarna; Nyberg: a var na
(with cod. K5). A dual of device or decision is out of the ques
tion, Zoroaster does not invite votes against himself. The impers.
“a var na, come here to us!” is the only possible reading; srota
and avaneta are equally imperatives, sazdyai and bodanto have
imperative meaning. The instr. vahista manaha (super!, of vahu
manah) refers to the three imperatives. There is no other regens
for the gen. vici^ahya but para mazo ya.aho. vici^a is “choice,
decision,” cf. Y.33,3 rs visyata, Y.49,6 rs vicidyai, and tat moi
vicidyai in Y.31,5 (Benveniste lnf.av. p.8i).
sazdyai: as in Y.51,6 “a^a no sazdyai usta, thus it shall be
come apparent for us, if He wills!” cf. under ‘Fravarani.’ The
verb V sand- means “to become apparent, manifest,
reality”; the subject “it” is the decision; the dat. ahmai is “for
us, in our favor.” pati.bodanto is participle, at the end of a
stanza, as usual, vocative: “you (who are) perceiving ones, spec
tators”; Vbod-, “sentire,” scil. perceiving (srota, avaneta) what
shall “become manifest, sazdyai.” pati.bodanto, hence, means
“qui vivra verra,” you shall witness the decision in our favor,
you all shall live to see the ya-ahi, the triumph.
Of the three Awestic passages only the first, Y/.i3,4i, has some value:
da^ris ahmai vahu hvarno yo his a^a frayazate
kahmaicit ya.aham jaso kahmaicit anzaham biwiva



YA-AHl!
262
The sentence is part of the mythical description of the Fravarti who
help in all fights and troubles; “who bring luck to him who implores
them constantly, whenever it comes to a ya.ahi, whenever he is in
trouble.”
hvarnah = tyche, at the end of the 5th century = fortuna, also in the
gatha. anzah = anger, anxiety. Germ. “Enge” and “Angst.” biwiva, re
dupl.perf. of Vbi- “to become frightened,” NP. bim; its etymological
connection with OHG. biben > beben, bibbern, to quiver, is contested,
but that is the meaning, here and elsewhere.
ya.ahi, again, is the triumphal shouting that accompanies the last
spurt in racing. The “pire misere intellectuelle” of the redactors has
disfigured also this passage by interpolating “like the orthodox Zoro
aster, the index of the material world, the koryphe of the two-legged
ones, barsnus bipatikanaya,” thereby making Zoroaster the one who
lives in a continuous state of fright.
y/.ii,3: rs.uxSo vaxs ya.ahi vr^rajanstamo
The verses speak of the ahunavarya prayer as magic charm, and
one must translate: “the correctly pronounced (ahunavarya) word is
the most conquering ya-ahi!”
Y.36,2, repeated in Y.58,7 : Atars shall come to meet the worshippers
namistahya namaha na mazistai yaham patijamya, at their “footfallest”^
footfall at the greatest of ya-ahi!
On a little church in front of the east gate of Rusafa I once discovered
an inscription: vLKa 17 tux^} ’AXaixovuSdpov, “Conquer fortune of al
Mundhir!”' In circuses one often finds: v'lKa i tIxt) tov Beverov, Con
quer, fortune of the Blues! There is also Lat. nika.^ It is the usual cry
of applause at the end spurt, the victory in the race. But one finds also
viKa 7] Tvxn T&v X.P[pLa-TLavdtv], hence the figure under which Zoro
aster speaks of his religion applied to the victory of Christianity. In
Constantinople and in Syria the spectators—bhdanto pati—shouted
nika, in Iran ya-ahi! The exclamation belongs to iTjie UaLav, or tTjios,
^ Text: n^m-, equally worthless whether superl. of namra, naman, or as I take it, of namah. - Cf. Mshatta, Hira und Bddiya in Jaiirb.Prcuss.KunstsIg. 1921, 115. ® PPUAES in, A, 3, to inscr. 256. A coincidence: Pers. nika for “bravo” is good Persian.



ya-ahI! 263
Idios as call of the Apollon of Delphi, or to evoi. Lat. euhoe. Germ, eia,
heia, juchhei etc., and is of IE. age.^
The antonym of ya.ahi!, equally old, is Gath. Aw. vayoi, vayu, avoi,
Lat. vae (victis), Got. wai, e.g. Y.53,7: “then, vayoi shall be your cry
at the very end!” or Y.54,6: “to the vayu.brdbyo they serve hellish food,”
a typical example of Zoroaster’s “causative compounds” : they cry vayu
because such food is served to them. And just as ya.ahi in Y.50,2 and
in the yasht, voya, avoya are inflected like a noun in Had.N. and Vid.
18 ,9
In Psalter, Ps. 122, avoy is written with inverse d: ’voy, cf. xvslvDy =
Xusroy. This word occurs also in Mfr.Ma«.n,24,ii, where the meaning
does not fit, and Henning tries “rettel”; it may be Aw. avahe, help!
In II,39,20, Henning translates TPars. v’y—which can scarcely
be anything but vayoi—by “triumph ( .?),” that is the sense of ya.ahi.
There, it might not be synonym, but antonym to “hail!”
When an exclamation “ya.ahi = hurrah!,” of which we have discussed
all instances, is translated by “crisis,” strange concepts are bound to
originate, and did so beyond expectation. Nyberg, 194: “Die Gatha 46
ist die Gatha der Grossen Krise,” beside smaller nervous crises. 191:
“fiber die Bedeutung dieser Krise ist eine lange Diskussion gefiihrt ”
Representative specimens of interpretations are: “akuter Konflikt zwi
schen den beiden arischen Hauptvdlkern, Iraniern und Indern; oder
inner-iranischer Konflikt; a) kulturell: Ackerbauern gegen Nomaden;
b) sozial: Klassenkampf der Armen gegen die Herren; c) lokal: West
Iran gegen Ost-Iran.” p.196: “Halten wir fest: Ausgangspunkt des
Streites ist: ein neuer Kult, kombiniertes Hauma- und Stier-Mysterium
dringt in Zarathustras Stamm ein. Wer sich in der Nacht mit Hauma
berauschte, konnte unmoglich am Tage danach arbeitsfahig sein.” 288:
“Zarathustras grosse geistige Krise wurde dadurch verursacht, dass der
Hauma-Kult . . . sein Werk vernichtete . . . , den er selber in seiner
Gemeinde einfiihrte.” 201 : “Der Angriff des neuen Kultes ist eine le
* Ir. bax bax, Arab, bah bah has the same sense, whence bahbuha (see under ‘Hospitium’). I heard also, in Persia, bah bah! which 1 regard as the otherwise obsolete pos. \ahu, of the
compar. beh < vahya. At any rate it is the same as x''2s X'^s, e.g. in Art.Vir.Ndm. 3,18.
Zamakhsharl, Lex.Ar.-Pers. 84: “nika nika dar waqt i ridi guyand, ahsant ahsant!" On the so-called baxi-dirham bax bax is written like rast on Sas. coins, or like babbanu, .-Vkk. transl. of OP. naiba (nev, nika) applied to Seleucid coins: “good, of full weight.” Stickel, BUisiegel,
ZDMG 20 (1866), 346, quotes Fleischer, zd.mg 9, 612, Turk. Qdmus: “everyone who sees these dirhams, because they are unalloyed and good, says: bah bah!”



264 YA-AHi!
bensgefahrliche Bedrohung dessen, was der Herzpunkt in der Religion
der Gatha-Gemeinde war: des maga-Mysteriums, der Ekstase.” 202:
“Der neue Kult ist nicht nur negativ schadlich, er enthalt auch ein
positives libel, eine neue Mysterienfeier, welche die alte aufhebt. Das
ist die wirhjiche Bedeutung der Krise” (emphasis in the original).
The “real signification” of the “crisis” ya-ahi is “hurrah!” The word
was mysterious, but has nothing to do with mysteries.



XVII. MAGA
“Von froeuden hochgeziten muget ir nu wunder hoeren sagen.”
Maga was more mysterious even than ya-ahi! The accepted transla
tion was “league, Bund,” first advanced by Geldner and Justi, without
etymology, merely on the strength of Y.54,7: “if you desert this maga.”
Bartholomae defined it {Wb.)'. “Bund, Geheimbund, spez. von der
zarathutrischen Religionsgemeinschaft, ein term, techn., dessen eigent
liche Bedeutung nicht zu entscheiden.”
Messina, Ursprung der Magier and Markwart saw in it Ved. “magha,
gift, present,” and interpreted it as the “Zoroastrian religion”; similarly
Andreas, as an abbreviation of “vahos manaho maga, gift of Vahu
mano,” nggw 1931, 111,323. In AltpJnschr. 171 ,
1
described it in analogy
to the figure of the racing for the victory of religion as a metaphoric
expression, referring to something similar to the modern zorkhanah,
half Greek gymnasium, half takiya of dancing darwishes. Nyberg’s
explanation is, 201 : “Das maga Mysterium, Herzpunkt in der Religion
der Gatha Gemeinde” and “maga, to Vmang-, mag- (i) primarily the
‘Sangschar’ der Ekstatiker, deren vornehmstes Mittel zur Erreichung
der Ekstase der Gesang war; (2) secondarily: der Platz wo sie die
Ekstase erreicht, der magisch geschiitzte Raum fiir Daemonenaustrei
bungen.” Since demons used to be especially active during a prima nox,
in Y.51,7 this consummation takes place on that protected area; finally,
the “magisch geschutzte Raum” alone remains. Darwish exercises are
well known to me, with their long hours of “huwe, huwe, huwe,” that
have the same “virtus dormitiva” as “duce, duce, duce,” “cuius est natura
sensus assoupire” (Moliere). None of these ways leads to cognition.
The rarely used word is not a common term—as e.g. dena is—^for the
religious group around Zoroaster, but its use is restricted to a certain
metaphor: wherever the word appears, the verses speak of friends,
guests or banquet, praising and singing. The term is solely a figurative
one. It appears only six times, the derivative magavan twice. Of these
eight instances three are in Y.51, two in 53, and there one must look for
the solution.



266 MAGA
In y.51,7 the exact meaning of maga is plain. The train of thought
begins in 51,5:
saxvani vazamnabyo kanibyo mromi
Xsmabyasca '"vadayamna manca i dazdvam
“I will tell commandments for the bridal maidens and for you, bride
grooms, impress them on your memory (and grasp them in your
hearts) !”
The many var.lect. of vadayamna lead to archet. v(’)dymn, regular
caus., lit. “those who lead to marriage” (Germ, “zur Ehe fiihren”),
bridegrooms, as Geldner already foresaw. They must of necessity be
mentioned, among other reasons because they are addressed in the voca
tive, whereas the brides, vazamna, are spoken of only in 3rd person.
Bartholomae’s interpretation “mahnend” is as impossible as Nyberg’s
“(Priester) der mit seinen Kraften (=kraft seines Amtes) zur Ehe
giebt.” The “giving away in marriage” was done by the “pads,” in
whose “potestas” the girl was, the father who gives away a daughter,
or the brother his sister, cf. Y.9,23 or upa.vaSaya in Vid. 14,15.
St.6 begins; “This is true, you men and women!” What follows is
much disturbed by infiltration of glosses. If a charm against demons
should be found in these verses, it would be no more significant for the
religion of Zoroaster, than the bismillah, the Muslim is supposed to
pronounce in the same situation, for the religion of Muhammad.
St.7:
atca VO mizdam ahat ahya magahya
yavat azus zarzdiko bunoi ha^tiya
para mrocans oraca (rest corrupt, gap)
vizaya^a magam tarn
at VO vayoi ahati apamam vaco
“Yours shall be the award from this maga, simulatque penis in infima
parte femorum vehementissime ardet, prorsum retrorsumque movens
But if you desert this maga, yours shall be cries of woe at the very end!”
The Pahl. transl. had correctly understood the decisive sen

text becomes incomprehensible: whither reaches the spirit of

only omitting para mrocans oraca, but without recognizing that
he had, thereby, the solution of the problem of maga in his
hand.
In this passage the meaning “marriage, wedding” of maga is unques
tionable. With the prohibition of divorce in st.y, the “Wedding Gatha”
ends, and with st.8—as in Y.50 with st.6, see under ‘Poetry’—a new
gatha begins.
Bartholomae remarks : “Die einzige Gatha, von der wir den ausseren
Anlass zur Dichtung kennen: es war das Fest der Vermahlung Jamas
pas mit Zarathustras jiingster Tochter Porucista. Bei dem kirchlichen
Akt, dem der Fiirst Vistaspa, ferner Frasaustra und ein Sohn Zarathus
tras beiwohnten, wurden noch einige weitere Brautpaare zusammen
gesprochen.” When reading these “Society News” of an old-fashioned
provincial paper, one believes one hears the princely guests singing, in
church, hymn n*” 53, verse 7, which Bartholomae had failed to under
stand.
Nyberg sees, on the one hand, in vadayamna the priest celebrating
the marriage ceremony, but says on the other hand, 27: “In Y.53 wird
ein Versuch gemacht, eine spezifisch zoroastrische Fruchtbarkeitsgottin
einzufiihren, namlich Zarathustras Tochter Porucista,” against two old
rivals, Ardvi and Rtis; he believes the attempt “suffered shipwreck”
one of the many shipwrecks in the book—because Rtis “was too deeply
anchored,” and allows finally the old Ardvi to come out as victress.
The Goddess of Fertility in modern literature is simply sickening.
The rule given about marrying off young girls is preserved in Vid.
14,15: “kanyam a.skandam an.upa.itam (nrbyo rtavabyo rtaya vahvya
rune ci^im nisrinvyat datar . . . ka ya kanya ? at mrot AhuraMazda)

nrbyo rtavabyo upa.vaSayanta,” “they (scil. the patayo) shall give a
healthy virginal maiden, whether her relation be (their) sister or daugh
ter, equipped with earrings, after her fifteenth year, in marriage to



268 MAGA
orthodox men.” This fragment of a civil law code is, in the Videvdad,
worked into penalties for a blow by which an otter has lost its eyesight,
besides many other disbursements in kind, all measured by ten thou
sands, which the whole Iranian empire at its apogee would never have
been capable of delivering.
The “Wedding Gatha” is a few years younger than the memorial
list where Purucista is yet unmarried, but Zoroaster has already a little
grandson, Rvatatnara aparazata, and Zamaspa has a namesake in a
grandson or rather great-grandson, Zamaspa aparazata. According to
Bartholomae’s interpretation, universally accepted and I believe based
on the so-called “tradition,” Purucista would have married the elder
brother of her grandfather. It is customary to marry at sixty a girl of
sixteen preferably, but those are wives of such and such a degree, and
Zoroaster could never have given his daughter, and moreover have
made a poem, for such a misalliance.
The verses address at least two bridal pairs. Zoroaster’s son and daugh
ter are both quite young and marry for the first time. The instruction
even without the “Einscharfer” (incalculator) whom Bartholomae saw
in ’patyastim, st.3—cannot be meant for people of sixty, but only of
sixteen. If none but the children were mentioned, one ought to conclude
that they married each other in hvetuvada^a. But Vistaspa and Jamaspa,
of the generation of the fathers and grandfathers, can only be present,
like Zoroaster himself, as giving away their own children or grand
children. The children of Zoroaster, hence, did not marry each other.
Both son and daughter are called with double gentilic: zara^ustris
spitama and spitami hecataspana. A passage in Mas'udi, mtirud] viii,6o,
elucidates what that means: “The insolence of the army of the Zandj
was such that women of the house of Hasan, Husain, ‘Abbas, Hashi
mites and Quraish, of the most noble Arab houses—abna al-nas—were
sold at auction. The price of a girl was from two to three dirham, and
the outcrier shouted: Such and such, daughter of such and such, of
the house of such and such !” The double gentilicia of the gatha express
that Zoroaster’s children marry, as of equal birth, into the families
Haugava and Notarya (Ha;)^amanisiya). Purucista, here expressly
called “youngest” (daughter or child), was a daughter of Zoroaster’s
third wife, the Haugavi; the reason for Zamaspa’s presence is that he
was her great-uncle and vispatis of the clan (not that he marries her).



MAGA 2^
As eligible husband for Purucista in this circle, only Vistaspa’s eldest
son Pisisyo^na or 2amaspa’s grandson (or great-grandson) Zamaspa II
are in question. Not much speaks in favor of the first: Vistaspa may
be present as giving away a granddaughter to Zoroaster’s son (Hvar
ci^ra) ; no other reason, but the role, Pisisyo^na plays in the eschatolog
ical legend, which makes him the helper of the sosyant—analogy to
Vikaspa as protector of Zoroaster—but also the superior of Hvarci^ra.
This feature reminds one of ‘All, son-in-law of Muhammad, in shi‘ite
eschatology which borrowed many features from the Iranian: the son
in-law, deified against all historical deserts, is the ancestor of the
Mahdi-sosyant. Zamaspa’s grandson has much better claim: Arta
xerxes I married Damaspia-Zamaspi who may well be a granddaughter
of Purucista’s marriage to Zamaspa II, hence a great-granddaughter of
Zoroaster and the Haugavi (cf. under ‘Haugava’).
For the other occurrences of maga and magavan, the signification
“marriage,” fitting in Y.51, is too narrow; it is not the act of marrying,
but the ceremony of the “wedding,” Germ. “Hochzeit” especially in
the wider meaning of MHG. hochgezite, OI. mahavrata, festival, cele
bration.
In y.29,11, end of the “Gatha of the Cow,” the soul of the ox speaks,
also in the name of the cow:
at ma(m) rta
yuzam mazda fraxsnane mazoi magaya patizanta
ahura nu n5 avar ahama ratois yusmavatam
“You, Mazdah, honor us by letting us be guests at the great celebration,
come, we want to be of your Highness’ servants!”*
The style is courtly, the soul of the ox speaks like a servant, only
“nu no avar,” an imperative, Arab. ta‘al!, come here, do it! seems to
he intentionally unpolished. In Tabari 111,1544, Baikbak, leader of the
Turks of Samarra, says to the caliph al-Musta‘in in Baghdad: “If you
really have pardoned us, then come and ride with us to Samarra, the
Turks are waiting for you! The Tahirid Muhammad b. ‘Abdallah
gives somebody a wink, and the man gives Baikbak a cuff on the
mouth, saying: Is that the way to speak to the Commander of the Faith

ful? You are to ride with us! Musta'in laughed and said: Those are a
pack of barbarians, qaum min al- udjm, they have no idea what one
may say and what not” (da^am and ada^am).
Y.46,14 (text under ‘Ya-ahil’): “Zoroaster, which faithful is your
friend, rva^o, for the mazoi magai, the great festival, who wants to be
praised in song? He, kavi Vistaspa, io triumphe!”
rva^a is hospes as well as xenos; the dative of intention “for the
festival” means “invited or inviting to” the celebration of victory, at
which one eats, drinks and sings odes or panegyrics, rva^a is here equal
to magavan.
Y.51,11: “Who is the Spitama Zoroaster’s friend?” with rva^a in the
sense hospes; “ko va vahos manaho *acisto magai rsvo, which high one
is ready for Vahumano’s festival ?”
rsva designates the high rank, OP. tunvant. Vahumano, as always,
has the twofold meaning Good-Will as way of thinking and as aspect
of AhuraMazdah. acista, if to ci6-, is “persuaded,” if to V cit-, “intent,”
cf. Vcis- “promise”; at any rate, it means accepting the invitation.
Nietzsche: “Freund Zarathustra kam, der Cast der Gaste.” The names
of the “high ones” follow: not the kavi Vehviyo who rejected Zoroaster,
but kavi Vistaspa, the hvetu Haugava, and others.
Y.51,16:
tarn kava vika.aspo magahya ^sa^ra nansat
vahos padbis manaho yam cistim rta manta
spanto mazda ahuro a^a no sazdyai usta
“Kavi Vistaspa has obtained her by the banquet of (or: by being guest
at) the festival on the paths of Vahumano, her, the cistis, whom as rtam
the holy AhuraMazdah has devised. Thus it shall become apparent
(reality) for us, as He wills!”
Gistis is “cognition” and AhuraMazdah’s partial figure, devised by
Zoroaster, and substituted, by him, to Usa, the Dawn.’* At the end of
this gatha Zoroaster offers to these high ones his songs as sacrifice and
circumambulates them in worship with his songs of praise.
“magavan” expresses “belonging to the maga.”
3 See under ‘Hospitlum,’ and cf. y.32,9 “where Cistis will be at home” under ‘Myastra.’ usta = “if God wills” see under ‘Fravarani’ and ‘Ya-ahi!’



MAGA 271
Y.5I.I5:
hyat mizdam zara^ustro magavabyo coik para
“the award, Zoroaster has promised the magavan, celebrators.”
^•33 >7 :
ya sruye paro magavano
“that it may be praised (extolled) also outside the magavan, the cele
brators.”
While in Y.51 maga has the narrower meaning “marriage,” at all
other places it is “wedding” in the wider meaning, like ydfio? in the
parable MattA. 22 (see under ‘Hospitium’). It is a celebration, part of
which was singing and music, as in Greece and Arabia, maga is far from
being a technical term for Zoroaster’s community, but solely a meta
phor: just as racing serves as figure for his strife, so the celebration as
figure for his success.
magavan appears in the Rgveda. In Hertel’s translation, Siegesf. 142,
Rv. v,i6,5 says: “Bei seinem Preise sind die Reichen in der Freundschaft
des Agni.”
Die “Reichen, maghavanah,” are the magavano. “In der Freundschaft
sein”—opp. to Lat. essere in odio, to be hated—means “to be loved.”
The gathas use the same idiom: Y.43,10 “parsta ahma, to be in-the
question,” i.e. such that are to be questioned, judged; or Y.32,8 “0wahmi
vici^oi ahmi, I am in-separation by you,” i.e. you must separate me
from, cf. Benveniste, lnf.av. 33. “Bei seinem Preise” corresponds to
“yasne pati” in the last stanza of Y.51,22:
yahya moi rtat haca vahistam yasne pati
veda mazda ahuro yoi aharca hantica
tarn yazai hvais namanis parica jasai vanta
“To whom, for my sake, A.M. through [the mouth of] Rtam has
destined paradise ‘at’ (as reward for) their yasna,—those who were
and those who are—those I want to circumambulate with songs of
praise!”^
Accordingly uv.v,i6,3 means: “the maghavanah are treated by Agni
as friends (rva^a= guests) when [occasion and reason] they praise
him” [by yasna and vahma]. The conformity between the Vedic and
^ The stanza is the origin of the “yahya hatam,” see text under ‘Deva.’



MAGA
272
the Gathic concept and wording proves that the whole notion comes
down from high Aryan antiquity. Only traces survive in India and
Iran. Those who participate in the maga, the magavan, are men who
celebrate; songs are always mentioned in the neighborhood of maga.
It is therefore possible that maga belongs to Vmang-, as Nyberg as
sumed, only in a different sense.
Vmang- appears only as mimayzo in y.45,10:
tarn no yasnais armatois mimayzo
yo anmani mazda sravi ahuro
These verses stand in parallel with Y.45,8:
tarn no stotais namaho avivrso
at hoi vahman dmane garo nidama
And 45,9:
tarn no vahu mat manaho cixsnuso
(8:) “trying to win Him with hymns of prosternation, for Him we
want to lay down our songs in the store-house (of heaven),” (9:) “try
ing to be obedient to Him together with Good-Will,” (10:) “wishing to
glorify Him with offerings of Armatis, Obedience.” Zoroaster’s sacri
fices are never sanguinary ones, but his songs. “Sacrifices of Armatis”
means “Obedience to the law, replacing sacrifices.” Bartholomae Wb.’.
mimayzo, desid.praes. “zu verherrlichen suchend, sva. feiern.” In this
way, maga, to V mang- “celebrate,” is directly “celebration, festival,” the
main part of which was originally singing, song.

(and in m%za.rayi, Y.43,12). With its striking nasal 5, it might not be
the “normal form of composition of mazant, great,” an interpretation
that rests on the assumption “xsa^ra to Vxsi-, rule, empire,” whereas
it is “xsa^ra to Vx^an-, banquet, hospitality” (see under ‘Hospitium’).
As in Y.45,8 the vahma are laid down in the garo dmane, so in Y.49,10
the m^za-xsa^ra are laid down" together with the “souls” of the faith
ful, their prayer, namah, and their obedience, armatis. It is tempting
to attach '’mangza ( with 4 for ang) to Vmang-. On the other hand,
with manza = mazant, one may compare Skr. maha.vrata.
In ZAirWb. 152, Bartholomae quoted, from F. W. K. Muller, the
^ In parallel with Iza, draught of health” and “nectar and ambrosia,” see under ‘Harvatat.’



MAGA 273
Turfan frgmt. (= MirMan. 11,14,18) : “pas dusmenan ‘spa^r virast srod
u nuvag e vas, thereupon a banquet was served up by the enemies,
much music and song; the besieged looked at it covetously.” Salemann
Manichaica iv,45 took spaxr as “Tauschung, tricks” in the sense of
“Gaukler, Akrobaten u.dgl” (jugglers, acrobats). The passage of AyatJ{.
Zar. §§41-42, quoted by him, does not at all support this interpretation
(see under ‘Industries’). Henning accepted it, MirMan. ii. Whether
Bartholomae’s etymology “to us + pacati=:Festmahl” is right or not,®
the word must contain the idea of eating, for at nothing else would the
besieged look “covetously.”
The place decisive for the understanding of maga is st.7 of the “Wed
ding Gatha”; maga means just that: “wedding.” In Zoroaster’s style
it means as much as and not more than ydixos in the parable of the
wedding in Matth. 22. As metaphor for the acceptance of the religion,
the wedding-feast with its celebrating guests is an analogy to the ex
pression “sar, connubium, with ’V’ahumano”; “vahos manaho maga”
would be exactly the same: to live in sar with Vahumano. In a broader
sense maga is Gr. eopTTj, and “maza maga” corresponds to Skr. “ma
havrata, the great festival, hochgezite.” Nietzsche: “Die Hochzeit kam
fiir Licht und Finsternis.”
® Not to be confounded with spehr, spihr < spayaflra, but perhaps connected with a corrupt
word, in incomprehensible context, in y.51,6, transcribed by Bartholomae by ++h6is pi9a+, to be read hispi^a, redupl. perf. of V spid-.



XVIII. MYASTRA
‘"Nun feiern wir das Fest der Feste, Freund Zarathustra kam der Cast der Giiste.”
Y.46,14 (under ‘Ya-ahi!’) “Zoroaster, which faithful one is your
friend for the great festival, who wants to be praised in song?” goes on:
yans.tu mazda hadmoi minas ahura
tan zubaya vahos u^dais manaho
“Those whom Thou, A.M. wilt gather (?) in the same house (with
Thee), those I will announce with words of Good-Will!” The great
triumph, ya-ahi !, is celebrated in AhuraMazdah’s house, and in con
tinuation, the train of thought passes to the contrary, to hell, where the
drugvant are “ha^ya astayo, fit guests” for the table of Ahriman.
zbaya- (the meter requires zub/vaya-) means “to cry, call out,” OP.
patiyazbayam, done by a herald. Zoroaster will announce—not only “He,
kavi Vikaspa!”—all the entering guests, rva^a. The metaphor is full of
court ceremonial. In also in Art.Vir.Ndm.xi, it is Vahumano,
Good-Will, himself who greets the souls with Welcome! as mihmandar
or andemankar. There is no difficulty, except the hapax “minas,” for
which the context requires the meaning “to gather, receive hospitably”
or the like.^
The idea of the same festival recurs in Y.30,9:
atca toi vayam hyama yoi im frasam krnavan ahum
mazdasca ahuraho a myastra barana rtaca
yat ha^ra mana bavat ya^ra cistis ahat me^a

“We want to be those who make this world beyond (contest), Mazdah
and you other ahura, and Rtam, grant hospitality, so that the souls
may come together in the house where Cistis will be!”
Bartholomae: “Und die mdchten wir sein, die die Menschheit
tauglich machen! Mazdah und ihr andren Ahuras, heran
1 Bartholomae, at first, in Ar.Forschg. 11,170, defined minas as “a.sg. prcs.act. Ar. *minaxs-, cf. mextan.” This Vmic-, mek-, c£. Hubschmann, Pers-Sttid. 9, is rcprcsmtcd by mCkant, “the mingling (not, IF^.1104: hervorsickernd), gathering, forthflowing waters, in which is good swimming, good bathing.” Later, JF^.iigo, Bartholomae put minas as nasal pres, to Vmyas-, a verb else only attested by the obscure hamamyasaite in y.33,1, in Pahl.Vid. ham ya saite, which refers to the hamestagan gah, the purgatory. In Sas.Recht 111,33, he put hamest (which can hardly be separated from ’ham.myasate) , as part.perf.pass. to “the verbal base in myastra.” This he connected not with Vmvas-, but with Vmid-, in .\w. hamid.pati. I conjecture that minas belongs to this group.



MYASTRA 275
(kommt) ! Eure Bundesgenossenscjiaft gew^rend, auf dass die
Gedanken sich sammeln, wo die Einsicht noch schwankend
ist!”
Andreas: “
, die dieses Leben zu einem herrlichen (oder:
Wunder) gestaken. O A.M. und ihr andren Herren, und Du,
Rt., gewahrt euer Biindnis, damit sich die Gedanken auf einen
Punkt richten, wo die Einsicht falsch ist!”
Nyberg, 144 (cf. 226, 228): “damit die manah (pi.) dort
zusammenkommen, wo die Paargenossin (Doppelgangerin)
Gisti ist.” Thereupon follow reflections on the divine powers,
simple or combined as plural, which dissolve themselves, totally
or partially, in the highest god, moreover on doubles.
The frasam-making takes place after the great ya-ahii, at the end of
the ninth millennium. It is always again the same metaphor of the race
course: the frasakrtis, apatiyarakih is the condition after the races, when
the world, itself the struggle of good and evil, will be “beyond (strug
gle).” After the contest comes the feast with eating, drinking and sing
ing. In Y.49,9 (under ‘Ya-ahil’) it is the dena (pi.), the faiths of the
faithful that carry home the victory harnessed to their chariots; in Vid.
19,30 they are called “ruvano, souls, lives”; here “manah, mentes.” They
gather at the festival at which AhuraMazdah is present, in all his gar
ments, especially as Rtam, granting societatem—“hospitality,” not alli
ance, confederacy—myastra barana. Andreas read '"maistra; OP. would
be mis 0''a > misa; the meaning is “party, Gesellschaft.”
The guests are here the manah, there the dena; host is here the one
who is myastra barana, in 46,15 he who minas hadmoi, receives in his
own house: the date, too, is the same: the 1.1.9000. The address cannot
possibly have been lacking: “where Cistis is me^a[-]” corresponds here
to “hadmoi with AhuraMazdah.” The word is one syllable short; the
Pahl.transl. is “andar mehan, at home.”' Cistis replaces Usa-Eos with
Zoroaster, and Eos’ house Usidam is known; Mithra, too, gets a me^a
nam “apportioned” by AhuraMazdah on the High Kara, sec under
‘Mithra.’ The final -a in Arsacid script is hardly distinguishable from
-ny; the text which the Pahl. transl. used had mytny = me^ane, andar
K>berg, i43- niae^a, fehlgedcutet als “schwankend, wandelbar,” heisst immer “paarweisc verbunden,” “mactfa, Paar.’*

276
mehan, and “me^ane” must be restored. In Odyssey xii,3, dancing took
place in the house of Eos.
The verses describe the feast in heaven after the victory of Good over
Evil, at the end of the world, and this metaphor is continued in the
next stanza, y.30,10:
ada zi ava drujo bavati skando spaya^rahya
at asista yojante a husitois vahos manaho
mazda rtahyaca yoi "^zaznate vahau sravahi
“Then, collapse of the vault of the druxs will come to pass, but those
will partake of the promise of the fair abode of Vahumano, Mazdah
and Rtam, who in (their) good reputation are deemed worthy (of it).”
Andreas: “Dann wird stattfinden jene Zertriimmerung des
Gliickes der Liige, dann werden der Verheissung auf die gute
Wohnung des Guten-Sinnes, des Weisen und des Rechts, die
jenigen teilhaftig werden, die im Besitze des guten Rufes sind.”
The two last lines speak once more of dwelling in heaven,
the house of AhuraMazdah. To dwell in the same house with
him is promised to the pious.—^Where asisti appears for the
second time, in Y.44,9, see under ‘Hospitium,’ it is equally asso
ciated with the rsva the “high halls” of paradise.
The pious are qualified by the rel. clause “yoi ''zaznate vahau
sravahi, who are deemed worthy”; Pahl. transl. namakih, for
the loc. vahau sravahi. This expression alludes to hausravaha,
the worldly, epical fame, and means the ethically good reputa
tion. Andreas followed Bartholomae’s explanation of zazanti
1795 and Grdr.)-. “redupl. them, praes. of Vhaz-, sie hal
ten fest, die sich guten Ruf erwerben.” Except for zazvah and
its superb zazustama, no form ascribed to Vhaz- is free from
objections. The clause yoi zazanti/e asista yojante husitois ex
presses a similar thought as fraxsnane magaya patizanta in Y.
29,11, viz. to be deemed worthy to partake of the maga, or here
of the husiti. In the parable of the wedding, Matth. 22,8: “they
which were bidden were not worthy.” Cf. the noun patizanti
and Yr.15,36 patizanta in the nmana of Vikaspa, under ‘No
tarya.’ Tedesco explained to me that in reading ^zaznate the
form can be attached to VVan-, yiyvaa-KOi.



MYASTRA 277
The first sentence of the stanza must stay inside the same picture:
while the pious move into heaven, something corresponding to heaven,
but belonging to the Dru^s collapses, her spaya^ra. Though not recog
nized, this is a well known word: TPahl. ‘spyhr, in BPars. usually
spelled sp’hl for spyhl, all = spehr > NP. spihr “vault of heaven,” see
under ‘Astronomy.’ The “vault” of the Druxs is the same as her “he^a,
prison” in y.46,6.
In Y.30,9, Mazdah and his partial figures are “hosts” in the house of
CistiL AhuraMazdah minas hadmoi, i.e. gives hospitality, is receiving
the guests in his own house, and Vahumano is greeting them like a
mihmandar. The e^rapatis Man^ravaka, son of Saimuzis, bears in the
Memorial Document Y/.i3,i05 the second title “hamidpati.” He follows
in the list upon the family of Vikaspa and the Haugava, and precedes
Rtastu, the son of MaSyomaha, cousin of Zoroaster, who in Y.51,19 is
described as Spitama, and in Y/.13 follows Zoroaster as the very first.
Man^ravaka, hence, was one of the very great ones among those around
Vistaspa and Zoroaster. As e^rapati > herbaS he was a magus, hence
an aryaman, client of Vistaspa. The magi were judges, priests and
financial officers. Vistaspa had his e^rapatis > herbaS just as Cambyses
had his tkesa = mobaS in Gomata. The late legend transforms the client,
notaryano, into Mahrok e NoSaran, son of NoSar. Together with Vis
taspa and MaSyomaha he was drawn into the apocalyptic literature,
cf. Altplnschr. 85,2; i35f., and as Mahrok, son of Huvahm® he became
one of the magi who came to Bethlehem. Finally, in the Karnamak, the
wise Ket (or Kehan) e Hindukan, prophesies Ardasir that only a
descendant as well of Ardasir as of this Mahrok—there called “e anosak
zatan”—could become monarch of Eran.
Bartholomae abandoned a former interpretation of hamidpati, the
second title Grdr. §§264, 268: “Herr des Brennholzes, OI. samit.pani,”
whence Lommel’s “Flammenherr” —and advanced “Meister der
(Gelehrten) Genossenschaft,” where the scholars for once would be in
dispensable. hamid without object is no “society,” but a social meeting;
as chief of this activity the man is the mihmandar, maitre d’hotel of
^ Instead of “father of Vahmedata.” There are no other names formed with vahma, except Ass. wamitiarsu •< *vahmayat.rsa-, the en.er, dahyupatis of Media under Esarhaddon at the time of the foundation of the Meuian empire.

Vistaspa, a financial officer. As e^rapati, considering his prominent
place in the list, Man^ravaka was surely the mutawalli of the waqf, the
leading priest of the memorial fire founded by Vistaspa, and as hamid
pati he was his mihmandar. In both qualities he must have had business
with Zoroaster ever since Vistaspa gave him hospitium.
Both myastra and hamid must be attached to a root V mid-.
A synonym of hamid.pati would be OP. *mis^''a.pati. That is the
origin of a name which has harassed me since my first journey through
that region in 1906 : Mao-craySaTtKij, MecrcraySarat, Arab, masabadhan.
The occasional Arab, spelling with mah- is merely an assimilation to the
many names formed with Mah = Media. Meo-craySdrat, masabadhan is
not one of the frequent compounds with -pata,* but one with -pati, scil.
*mesba8, masbaS < OP. *mais^''apati, vrddhi of *mis0''apati.° The same
office is called in MP. NP. xvansalar “dapifer. High Steward.” The n.pr.

abbreviation of vahumano to vahu as in the name of Darius.

“Willst du in meinem Himmel mit mir leben, So oft du kommst, er soli dir offen scin!”

' ka mo ruva vahu rvasat '"agmata
The stanza begins; “This I ask Thee, answer me truthfully!” and the
short sentence is that question. At the first glance one recognizes; “Will
my soul with vahu agmata . .
.”
In modern language the everyday greeting is amadi, and NP.
Xos replaces old vahu. a.gmata is NP. amad, part.perf. of Vgam- “to
come,” with prev. a “to arrive.” Obviously, vahu agmata is “welcome,
willkommen, bienvenu, benvenuto” and so in almost all languages,
vahu-agmata is a variant of vahya.gmata “welcome,” as n.pr. in the
memorial list, and BehamaS as name of one of the Three Magi.^
The pos. vahu disappears from the language, unless it survives in the
exclamation bah bah ! xvas xvas !, perhaps because the word was unusual
in OP. In the salutation “drva, whole, healthy” takes its place. IPars.
and TPars. have “drvost ’vr, lit. well-come,” with Vr (cf. nu no avar!
in Y.29,11) as imperative of the threefold suppl. system part, ’mt, pres,
’y; as n.pr. drust.amad. The farewell is correspondingly pa-dro8! < dru
vat, Arm. drvat, <Aw. drvatat, the abstr. noun instead of the superb
druyist in the welcome; Aram, bislam = €V dprjvri, Lat. salus, salutare.
Yaqut 1,677,22 translates the archaic NP. hile8 va-dr68 by halluha bi
1-salam 1
In Vahumano asks the souls that enter paradise; “ka^a i8a
rtavan no agato.?, how have you, faithful, arrived.?” Wolff-Bartholo
mae’s translation “Wie (ist’s geschehen) asa.Glaubiger, (dass du) herge
kommen (bist) .?” makes of the “how do you do.?” a “how did you do
it.?”, an inconvenient expression of surprise instead of a welcome. The
souls do not even reply as much as “vahu,” but “go satisfied” by the
hearty welcome straight to AhuraMazdah’s golden throne. Ogmadeca
10 says; “yatakgowb bavat pa ravan e ave e anosakravban vahman e
amuhraspand u handeman e ohrmizd bavat, advocate (interceder) for
the soul of the blessed ones will be Vahman, the amuhraspand, and he
’The spelling is one of the many unwieldy and cumbrous ones in the Awesta. The majority of codd. has urvasat agomat ta. K5 better urv.asat agamatta. Tedesco wrote to me: “The grammatical value can be as well nom.pl. as sg. or instr.sg. of a neutr .abstr.”



WELCOME 281
will lead them to the presence of Ohrmizd.” Vahumano acts as han
demankaransalar, exactly as Zoroaster in Y.46,14: “Those whom Thou
A.M. wilt gather in the same house (with Thee), those I will armounce
with words of Vahumano!”
In Art.VirJ^am. 10,2 the souls of the blessed “drvt pvrsynd v ’pryn
‘m)VN.d, ask after Artaviraz’s health, get a blessing” as answer, and then
say the same words of greeting as Vahumano in Vid.ig,^i. In the next
chapter, xi,8, Vahumano himself greets Artaviraz with “namaz o tu,
artaviraz, drust-amat, prosternation to you, welcome!” and again the
words of F/W.19,31. He then leads him into AhuraMazdah’s presence,
deman, who is surrounded hy the amuhraspandan, archangels. Qur’an,
39,73: “The gates of paradise shall be opened and their keeper [in Art.
Vir.Ndm. Sros and ASar] says: Hail, you were good, enter for ever
more!” This is followed by “You shall see the angels circumambulating
the Throne!” Thus Islam has adopted the Zoroastrian notion.
The more so it is this reception which Zoroaster himself has in mind
in Y.44,8. The understanding of vahu agmata decides at the same time
the correct reading of the verb and the case of vahu agmata: rvasat is
right against rvaxsat of several codices: s-aor. of Vtvaz-, “laetari, to
rejoice at” with the cause in instr. Hence, agmata is instr., the exclama
tion itself, vahuagmata! is inflected like ya-ahl!, avoya!" “ka” is the
particle of interrogation. Thus the question is: “Will my soul rejoice
at ‘welcome!’?”
Bartholomae: “Wie wird meine Seele des begliickenden Guts
teilhaftig werden?” with agmata as 3.p.pret.med. and rvaxsat
“acc. sg. n. of rvaxsant, adj. aus einer Basis, die mit urvad- und
urvaz- verwandt ist,” 1^^.1542. Together with this rvaxsant,
the support for other semantic definitions falls. Nyberg, 158,
recognized rva(x)sat as verb, but attached it to Vrvag-.
Other places where Vrvaz- appears, speak equally of the admission
into paradise, e.g. Y.50,5, where AhuraMazdah is named in a, and b
says
yat yusmakai man^ranai vavraza^a
-In agreement with the inflection of short proverbs, cf. Y.29,7: tarn azutols (gen.) manSram gavoi, xsvidamca (acc.) huhursebyo, under ‘Harvatat’; and y.49,2: dorst: ahmai stoi armatim! (acc.) under ‘Bandva’ and ‘Armatis.’



282 WELCOME
The verb is 2.p.per£. of Vrvaz-. In d the god makes “zasta.ista, a
wink”; beckoning with the hand is a mudra, thus called in India, or
something like pollice verso and recto in the Roman circus. This mudra
of the judge is the permission to enter; from vavraza0a the thought
leaps at once to paradise, and the perf. of rvaz- must have a more
intense meaning than Bartholomae’s “freundlich gesinnt sein,” rather
NP. qabul kardan, “to agree, approve, sanction,” Arab, taqabbal Allahu
minhu, or “rida, being well pleased”; evBoKtjcra in Matth. 3,17.
Y.31,1, text under ‘ArmatiY; “If only the hvetu, vrzana, aryaman and
the deva (gods) would strive to obtain AhuraMazdah’s rvazman, then
He would say; We love your obedience, Armatis, she be ours!” There
the god accepts, with rvazman, graciously, the offer of gods and men,
just as Allah ‘accepts’ men and their work. The words he speaks ex
press this rvazman, are his rvaxs.uxti, “word of greeting.”
y.30,1; “I will speak ... of the rvaza, grace [if from god to men, if
vice versa ‘delight’] which he who takes it [my words] to heart, will
perceive [darsata, “live to see, erleben”] together with the luminaries
[of heaven in paradise].”
It is hard to believe, but this simplest of all questions (“Will my soul
rejoice at welcome?”) has been made by Nyberg the “cornerstone” of
his “Theory of Ecstasy”; “Wie wird meine Seek verziickt werden mit
der Schar der guten Angelangtenr”, 159; “vohu agmata kann nichts
andres bedeuten als ‘der gute Angelangte,’ in kollektiver Bedeutung
‘die Schar der guten Angelangten,’ die seligen Abgeschiedenen, die in
VohuManah’s Welt gelangt sind.” 158; “Die guten Angelangten ist
das Kollektiv der Toten des Stammes; also; Wie wird meine Seek
eine sokhe ekstatische Vereinigung mit VahuManah gewinnen, dass
das Ziel damit erreicht wird.” At another place one learns that the
“Ziel” is “not to forget a previous vision.” “Verziickt werden, to be en
raptured” is not a higher degree of “rvaz-, joy,” but is extracted from
rvaxsat to \Tvag- “to wander”; “Wandern bedeutet die Vereinigung
mit VahuManah in der Ekstase; der Ekstatiker, nicht der Tote geht
iiber die Cinvat-Briicke.” Atarpat, who knew the Awesta, for he wrote
it, says in his Andarz 139; “Though he live a hundred years, at the end
every man must go the way to the bridge.”



WELCOME 283
Vvrag- is only attested by rvaxsat, 3.pl. s-aor., in y.34,13, to OI.
vrajati “procedit.” rvat.caya in Y/.i3,ii (22 and 28) translated in
Wb., under wrong presumptions, by “wieder verbinden,” is a
causative, describing what the Fravarti do to the embryos,
something like “make grow, develop.” An interior -t.c- is always
a wrong spelling for an unusual orthography of the archetype.
If Ts = c, the stem may be vrak-, to be connected with the hapax
rvaxra in ¥^.19,69, anton. of ota “cold,” hence “heat,” as verb
“to heat.” Hertel, Venus 41, translates “bei den Auseinander
kochungen werde ich mit Glut erfiillen”; for “Auseinander
kochung” read “pregnancy.” Perhaps the warmth of the body
was conceived as an inner fire, causing and preserving life. If
-T.S- stands for -xs-, rvat.caya would belong to \/vrag', “pro
cedere,” cans, “to bring into existence, make born.” The text, in
both cases, is a syllable short, and no decision can be reached.
In Y.46,10-11 and Y.51,13, the two places where Zoroaster speaks of
the Cinvat bridge—which leads to heaven over the chasm of the nether
world—he himself “leads all followers safely across into the ‘King
dom,’ ” whereas the sinners, arriving at the bridge “shiver with fright
and become— [precipitated] —yavoi vispai, for all eternity, guests in
the house® of the Druxs.” Nyberg defines, 185, cinvato prtus as “Uber
gang (aus dieser Welt in die andre) des (zu jener Welt) hinzielenden
(Ekstatikers),” but 234: “Nicht nur der Weg des Toten, sondern der
des Ekstatikers,” and “Cinvato prtus ist also hier in erster Linie der
Weg der Ekstase . . . , die Schlussworte ‘fiir alle Zeit Gaste . . .’ kdnnen
jedoch darauf hindeuten, dass die Stelle von der endgiltigen Trennung
vom Irdischen im Tode handelt.” This backstepping recalls the poem
of the child nearing the “Liar’s bridge,” the Cinvat bridge in German
folk-lore. The final sentence is in no way ambiguous : heaven and hell
mean eternity. V ci- in cinvat does not signify “hinzielen,” but always

also in Vedic—“legere, pick out, select.” What happens at the bridge
is illustrated by some Turfan fragments: “ud dusqerdagan az de[n
varan] vicared usan 6 xby arag estenend” and “ud denvaran ke a] dasn
estend,” sinner and pious are “separated, vi.cared, Vci-,” the sinners
are made to stand to the left, the pious to the right, or in the words of
2 Dative, not loc., as in y.46,14 (under ‘Ya-ahi!’)"- “your friend for (=at) the festival,” mazoi magai, meaning “destined for, invited into the house.”

Matth. 23,32: "koX d<f)opia-ai avrovg d^r’ dXXTjXcov oxT'irep 6 TTOiprjV
d<j)opil^et rd irpo^ara otto t&v ip'ufxav.” No man ever came back from
the bridge. It is Job’s “path without return,” leads to the “land without
return” of the Babylonians.
But Zoroaster believed in the last judgment, and this notion and the
mythical notion of the bridge are incompatible: if the judgment should
take place before coming to the bridge, the apparatus would be of no
use; if after, the fallen souls would be condemned without being judged.
Therefore, in Zoroaster’s mouth the ancient notion is merely a meta
phor, no part of the creed.
rvazista and rvaza in Y.Haft. 36,2—see under ‘Ya-ahi!’—have the
same meaning as the verb rvaz- in y.50,5 and 31,1, hence belong to it.
Atars is invoked: “rvazisto ho na . . . patijamya atar . . . rvazikahya
rvazaya, as most gracious one come to meet us, o Fire, with most
gracious greeting, to the great triumph, ya-ahi!” meaning: “it would
be extremely gracious if. . . .”
“coming to meet” is a well known ceremony: pati.gam- is an istiqbal
(to qabala) ; not merely is the guest met at the door of the house, but
one rides as far as a day’s journey to meet him, with many attendants.
The Pahl. transl. uses for rvaza, rvazista, the same expression as for
rvaxs.uxti (word of greeting), spelled ’vIv’x-mny’, i.e. urvax-saxvan
“word of greeting,” salutation,* perfectly right.
Bartholomae: “Als wonnigster komme du uns, o Feuer, mit der

beim Durchschreiten des gliihenden Metallstromes im letzten Gericht,
wovon {lnd.)Bdh. 30,19 erziihlt.”” huvitica initi in Y.30,11—see under
‘Fravarani’—do not aim at any ordeal, though the Pahl. transl. seems
to think so, but are “paradise and hell,” predetermined end of history.

metal in the mountains melts, says only: “all men pass through it for
purification, the pious feel as if they walked through warm milk, but
to the sinners it is really like molten metal.” This description, written in
the loth century a.d., has been developed from Zoroaster’s scanty allu
sions to the ordeal as means of ascertaining guilt at the last judgment,
and out of the pre-Zoroastrian, mythical conception of the end of the
world in fire. But even there no word speaks of “rapture” at the crossing
of the metal stream. The idea is purely negative: the pious do not feel
it as the impious do.
Nyberg 279: “Selber erfiillt von grosster Verziickung mogest du zu
uns kommen zur Entscheidung(.?) . . . zu uns (wahrend wir) in der
Verziickung des Verziicktesten . . . (sind) mogest Du zur grdssten der
Krisen (yah) kommen!” and comments: “Schwerlich eine maga- oder
Ordal-seance im Still der gathischen Zeit . . . der Ausdruck yah [hurrah!]
leitet die Gedanken der Gemeinde zu dem grossen Ordal hin, bei dem
sie in der Verziickung um das Feuer die Verziickung der asa.Gliiu

of sulphur water and the like, not the “Ewige Wonnebrand” of the
Pater Ecstaticus in Faust.
To the “Wonne” in the footnotes of the he then adds an overdose
of Hertel’s “radiation-theory” and thus produces the perfect “theory of
ecstasy,” 201: “Der Herzpunkt in der Religion der Gatha-Gemeinde
war das maga-Mysterium, die Ekstase.” “Der maga [= wedding, see
under ‘Maga’] wird als gdttliches Kraftzentrum aufgefasst.” He de
scribes also the methods and techniques of the ecstasies, abstracted from
those harmless words, (245) : “Jamaspa u.a. haben sich fiir das Kraftzen
trum [power-center, as if it was a central power-station] des maga ent
schieden”; 139: “Fiir eine Vision ist erforderlich, dass eine gottliche
Strahlung mit einer menschlichen zusammentreffen.” “Cisti, die Seh
strahlung, geht sowohl vom Menschen wie vom Gottlichen aus; diese
beiden schneiden einander im maga.” “irixtam [=relictum, what is
‘left’ over], die Kraft, die fiir alle losgelassen ist, entladt sich oder wird
entladen, vgl. Y.48,7: Vohu Manah’s Entladung durch Asa, also ein
himmlischer Kraftausfluss. . . .” That sounds explosive—Schiller:
Wehe, wenn sie losgelassen!—and what I have learnt, as student, of
statics and physics is out of date in view of these metastatics of ecstatic

In y/.io,73, Mithra “raises his voice joyfully, rvazamno abaroit
vacam,” and then follow exactly the same words as in y/.io,63, where
he “wails” before AhuraMazdah. The passage belongs to the mazdayas
nian “rehabilitation” of the god, see ‘Return of the Gods,’ and is late,
but important, because the phrase is the verbal expression of the gath.
compound rvaxs.uxti.
y.32,12:
yoi gaus mrndan rvax^u^ti Jyotum
“who destroy with rvaxs.uxti the livelihood of the peasants.” jyotum is
not “life,” Gr. bios, but “livelihood,” Gr. biotos; killing the ox would
not destroy its livelihood, hence gaus is not the ox, but in Zoroaster’s
figurative style the peasant. Cf. the Assyrian expression, Sargon, ^th
Camp. 1.275: “ebura tuklat nise.su u “““pu.e napsat buli.su, I destroyed
the harvest, the support of its people, and the chaff, the life of its
cattle.”
Bartholomae: “Die das Leben des Rindes unter Freudengeschrei zu
grunde richten,” note: “Es handelt sich um mit Orgien verbundene
Totung des Rmds zu Opferzwecken.” He thinks of y.32,14 (text under
‘Homa’) where Zoroaster makes the Homa priests say: “The ox is to
be killed, gaus jadyai, that it may inflame to help him-before-whom
death-flees, durosa.” i.e. Homa, whose name Zoroaster does not let pass
his lips. JT^'.i 549: “Hauma wird dazu veranlasst, indem man ihm vom
Opfer einen Anted zuweist,” according to y/.ii,4 the jaw-bone.
In Y.Haft.^Ss is a highly archaic sentence which could be Vedic:
“apasca va azisca va matrasca va agnya drigu.dayaho vispa.pitis avocama,
we invoke you, waters, as the pregnant ones, the mother-cows, the not-to
be-slaughtered ones, the providers-of-the-poor, them that-water-all (-crea
tures).” The description of the cows as “agnya, Ved. aghnya, not-to-be
slaughtered” implies that steers were slaughtered and that the later
Indian attitude did not yet prevail. The reason for Zoroaster’s rejection
of sanguinary sacrifices in general is not a peculiar bias against the
cult of a certain god, but his general attitude towards “cult,” and
his standing up for the peasantry. There have never been anything like
continuous hecatombs of horses and oxen. This wrong notion is only
the result of the quotations from the epics in the yashts, where “a hun
dred [horses, a thousand oxen, ten thousand] sheep” are slaughtered



WELCOME 287
every time. The deficient meter of the verses alone proves that the pas
sages are retouched; if one eliminates the words between “a hundred”
and “sheep,” the meter is correct. Only hecatombs of sheep are his
torical : Darius ordered the slaughter of a hundred sheep for celebrating
the birth of his first grandchild Artystone II, according to the Persepolis
tablet, which books the expense. It means a big “banquet, mis^''a,” and
everything beyond that is unreal.
Bartholomae adds; “Die mit Tieropfern zu Ehren des Hauma ver
bundenen orgiastischen Feste . . . fanden jedenfalls, wie die Dionysien
zur Nachtzeit statt.” “Jedenfalls” means nothing but “probably,” and
the comparison with the Dionysia is the only support of this assump
tion, not only of their happening by night, but of their happening at
all. But the idea has taken root. Nyberg '244: “Orgiastische Feste mit
Stieropfern gehdren in Zarathustras Predigten (?) unaufloslich mit
Hauma-Orgien zusammen.” Zoroaster always declaims, 286: “gegen
die nachtlichen Orgien des Hauma-Kultes,” and yet, no word about
“nachtliche Orgien” appears. His proof for these nocturnal orgies is the
magnificent verse Y.50,10 : “The works, past and future, the sun’s light
and the dawn of day, whatever the eyesight perceives, praise Thee,
AhuraMazdah.” “Diese inspirierte Huldigung an die Machte des Tages
lichts ist eine versteckte”—“bien cache,” he says at another occasion

“Polemik gegen den Hauma-Kult, ein neues Beispiel fiir Zarathustras
diskrete Art, empfindliche Punkte bei den neuen Freunden zu beriih
ren.” Obviously, the new friends did not take the hint, for the Homa
cult went on. Never have such conclusions been drawn from the psalm
:
“The heavens declare the glory of the Eternal.”
Such is the background of the translations of rvaxs.uxti: Bartholo
mae’s “Freudengeschrei,” Andreas, gentler “unter Freudenrufen,” Ny
berg, “ekstatische Rufe.” Against these Hertel’s remark is aimed, Venus
77: “uxti, 01. ukti, immer nur ‘Aussage’ rvaxs.uxti kann also nur bedeu
ten dutch die Aussage (Angabe) dass”—so far right, but not the anti
climax:—“die Aussage dass der Genuss von Rindfleisch rvaxs. Glut
verleihe.” gaus is not the beef consumed, but something that consumes
its jyotum itself. In the related case of compounds with -vak,—e.g.
krkavaka, he who says krka, “kikeriki,” cock—the element before uxti
is the “saying” itself, here “grace, than\s”: “Give thanks to the Lord,
for His rvazman, kindness, rvaza, grace, lasts eternally!” The “ecstatic

cries” are the common “words of welcome and of thanks,” for instance
vahu agmata, or alhamduliliah, in general “thank God” and applause.
The Cinvat bridge contracts, in old belief, under the sinner, to the
width of a knife blade. Therein it is like the “way of ecstasy,” one falls
down from both. We are all sinners.
A problem is, whereto the n.pr. “rvaxsaya” belongs. It is the name
of the brother of Krsaspa, whose titles are in Yt.g,T.o tkesa and dataraza.
He is killed by Hitaspa, of whom Krsaspa takes blood-revenge, kena,
yr.15,28. The two titles describe him as magus; how this is compatible
with being the brother of Krsaspa, the two fragments of the myth do
not allow us to perceive. When the “data” of a judge is “razan, law,”
he is what was called till recently “mudjtahid.” I remember the answer
of an octogenarian mudjtahid of Isfahan, whom I had asked long ago
for a written fatwa, referring to a precedent a hundred years before:
“Certainly I could give it to you, but the precedent was under Path
‘All Shah; today, I am not sure whether the people would obey such
a fatwa by me!”—Nyberg 68: “Der Name deutet auf ekstatische tibun
gen hin,” and 191: “tkesa ‘Ordalmeister’ ”; 6: “dataraza, einer dessen
(Ordal)regel (AhuraMazdah’s) Gesetz ist.” This would be an anach
ronism, since “razan” is the term of the polytheistic period, and
Krsaspa and his brother belong to a phase of the myth where Ahura
Mazdah may still have been called Varuna.
The two titles recall those of Man^ravaka in Yr.13,105: e^rapati and
hamidpati, fire-priest and introducer of guests, mihmandar, see under
‘Myastra.’ Bartholomae interpreted rvaxsaya as “der Freude bring
ende.?”; Hertel assumes a causative stem. I prefer abbreviation of a
compound, e.g. ’rvaxsabara, cf. Ctesias ot^dpa? < ‘vahyabara, which
he translates by agathangelos; cf. rvaxs.uxti “salutation.” If the name
be a “talking” one, it may mean “who welcomes,” mihmand^.
In Karn.Art. (Nold. p.51) Ardashir gives the town he founded for
joy at the rediscovery of the Shahpuhr child, the name vl’s- or vlxs-sah
puhr. The first element cannot be the Arsacid name valas < vlgs, thus
on the coins of Volagases I, the etymology of which is obscure. Kaba
inscr. Pars. I.31 has vrd’xsy for Pahl. vlgsy, Gr.OYAAAZlOY, with inverse

XX. LAST JUDGMENT
“Dies irae dies ilia solvet seclum in favilla”
Law was administered under the power of an “ahura, lord justiciary.”
He decides, Sixa^et, by making the verdict of the court valid or not.
The task of the court is hiayvwvaL, vi.ci-. It consisted of a jury of
members of the vrzanam, presided by a judge, tkeM—qadi, mdbaS

who knew the “laws, tkesa.”
Many words for the procedure are derived from V ar-, “adjudge”
:
“ar^ra, trial, causa, task” and “court” ; “ar^a, legal contest” and “plain
tiff”; “duLr^ris, miscarriage of justice.” A remarkable shifting is to
be seen in the notion of “passing a sentence,” expressed by Vprs-, fras
“to question, interrogare,” cf. inquisition. OP.; “hufrastam aprsam, I
have justly punished.” The expression reveals that the inquiry, x^nut,
hearing, was the essential part of the procedure.^ The notion “atone
ment, adjustment” is rendered by V par-, = Lat. par, see under ‘Bandva,’
with many derivatives.' The word for “pronouncing” a sentence, and
likewise for the “deposition” of a witness is Vsanh-, cf. Y.43,6: “Arma
tis sanhati, pronounces the sentences, ratus, of the undeceivable x^atus,
^ Cf. OP. and Gath, prsai (Y,44,i2); frasa, prsta and frasta (y.49,2). In view of the relation existing between Ir. dcna and Akk. dlnu, .^rab. din, the relation of Ir. V prs- and the following Akk. words ought to be studied: Old Akk. verb purus, liprus, noun pirikum etc, “establishing of facts and decision of the judge.” Ass. “parasu, to separate, cf. Ir. vi-ci-,” Aram, ioanw. “farasa, to determine, explain,” cf. Zimmern in zdmg 74, 1920, 434.

mental power of the god,” who, in Y.29,4 (see below) is the viciro
ahnro and "^sahvar.m^isto.
Legal procedure also includes oath and ordeal. Bartholomae defined
“varah, oath, ordeal” as “eigentl. Beglaubigung, Erhartung des Rechts,
der Unschuld.” Vvar- is “to choose,” but in many Aw. passages it
means “to swear.” It furnishes also terms for professing, embracing a
religion, with or without prev. fra-, cf. the relation of Gr. pistis, Lat.
fides to the oath, and Arab, shahid and shahid, witness and martyr,
shahada “confession of faith,” ashhadu’llah, “God be my witness.”
Oath and ordeal come down from the IE. epoch and are often expressed
by the same word in IE. languages, thus also in Iranian. The passage
decisive for OP., Beh. §57, is mutilated: “aurm zd rtiyiy ya^a
ima ha^yam ne druxtam adam akunavam,” evidently a current legal
formula, I presume a verbal form of fra.var-, or denom. of fravarti:
“Oramazda be my witness that this is the actual truth (what) I have
done!” The modern word for swearing is “saugand x^rdan, to drink
sulphur water”—apo sokantavatl in Fzi/.4,54—to suffer the most com
mon ordeal.
The oath. Aw. y6z(da), Lat. iusiurandum, an oath of “purgation,”
is a curse upon one’s self. Some peoples of antiquity, so the Elamites,
called forth the ancestors, also the whole clan, as witnesses, “Eides
briider,” and often the oath took place at the ancestors’ tombs. These
“seconds, compurgators,” Teut. “der Umstand (those who stand
around)” are not produced as witnesses of the alleged crime, but in
order to manifest the number of the followership, the power of the
“friendship.”"'^ That is what “rva^a, amicitiae” means in the “Rasnu” or
“Ordeal-Yasht,” 8: “the rva^a ... I call forth to the ordeal, varah-, here
arranged!” Therefore, “fravarti,” term for the “manes, OI. pitarah,
ancestors” may originally mean “compurgator, witness of the oath.” The
amicitia ’ as “Umstand” is also the role of the Roman “vindex,” to “vin-,
clan and ‘ deico, dico, to point out.” Daily life, especially law, requires
the confirmation by oath of many things. At the trial of Afshin, in
Samarra, Ishaq b. Ibrahim, cousin of Tahir I, says, when Afshin ad
The caliph aTMuhtadl, Tabari iii,i79if.. sa>s “I take no oath except in presence of the Hlshimids [his clan], the q5drs ... and the ashSb al-maraub,” i.e. “people of the steps” such as descendants of ‘Uthman. Umayyads and Talibids.

mitted to have tolerated the address “god of gods”: “Woe to you,
Khaidar, how can you swear to us by Allah, and how can we believe you
and accept your oath, and treat you as a Muslim, if you are overweening
like Pharao?” It is instructive to compare the attitude of modern law,
which does not abandon the oath that has lost its old significance, but
tries to maintain its holiness by fear of a penalty for perjury.
Between oath and ordeal there is only a difference in degree. In the
severer form, the ordeal, “Gottesurteil,” the knowing gods manifest, at
once, guilt or innocence unknown to men.® The ordeal is the “testi
mony” of the gods, a deposition. The Den\art expresses this plainly
in the chapter on the tradition of the Awesta: Atarpat e Mahraspandan
corroborated the accuracy of the Awesta-text, as he wrote it, by an
ordeal: “pas ac bo^tan e Atarpat pat gowisn e passant, after A. had
been acquitted by the ‘gowisn, deposition’ of the ordeal.”^ The Art.Vir.
Nam. describes the form of this ordeal, i,i6: “Atarpat e Mahraspandan
MNV p‘n.? p'N.s’xt ZY p'N.dyn krt rvy vt’xt mdm vl lyxt, who under
went an ordeal relative to the religion (Awesta) by molten brass
poured on his breast.”® See Bartholomae, Z.Sas.Recht 11,9: “dem Beschul
digten ‘geschmolzenes Erz auf die Brust giessen’ wird M.644,18
als cine Methode des var-Vollziehens, var passaxtan, bezeichnet,” and
Salemann, Grdr.i,2g2, §87: passaxb ordeal, to Vsaz-, saxt, cans, of
V
saz-. Y.32,7: “ya - - sanhate - - hvena ay aha, which is ‘spoken’
( V sanh-, saxvan, deposition) by the red-hot brass,” the same as “go
wisn (= saxvan) of the ordeal.”
The “Ordeal-Yasht” 8, a poor compilation of formulae, mostly picked
up from other yashts, does not contribute more than the detail of the
“rva^a, amici-compurgators” to this picture. One can just recognize the
traces of these immemorially old institutions in Iranian.
The Awesta does not describe an ordeal that actually took place; still
less do the gatha contain any allusion to an ordeal to which Zoroaster

Haug translated “on whose breast, in the talc which is in the Denkart, melted brass was poured.”



292 LAST JUDGMENT
had been subjected. I believe Markwart introduced this error by an
interpretation of vii,4,3 (vol.xiv,37 Sanjana). Not even this pas
sage, based on material dating from the time of Xusrau I, says that
Zoroaster had submitted to an ordeal, but only that “he had made 33
kinds.” That means, the legal procedure, about a.d. 500, knew many
kinds. But not even the number is real; all multiples of ii are mystic.
Instead of 3 x ii one finds only three kinds in the whole literature. At
the end of the 9th century a.d., Zatsparm paraphrased the Denl{. pas
sage: “The amuhraspand ‘shows’ three kinds of ordeals (i) by fire; i.e.
a^ra of Y.31,3; (2) by red-hot iron, i.e. hvena ayaha of Y.32,7; Zoro
aster walks three steps on it without burning his soles; (3) by molten
brass, i.e. ayaha x^usta of Y.51,9, poured on the chest; Zoroaster seizes
it with his hands and offers it back to the archangel,” a story one could
find in acts of Syrian martyrs. It does not report an event, but describes,
figuratively, the introduction of the institution as such by Zoroaster.
Of course, he was believed to have created, at the beginning, all judicial
institutions existing at that time, and, of course, he had not introduced
the ordeal which existed for many centuries before his time.
Oath of purification and its severer form, the ordeal, are constituent
methods of judicial procedure, especially for ascertaining guilt during
the inquiry. The ordeal is neither the eruption of a volcano, as one
might think when reading “Asas Reich kommt in der Sturmglut des
Ordals,” Nyberg in, 126, 246, nor a Greek tragedy, “der Auftakt giebt
eine Ordalszenerie,” 154, 244, nor a masonic meeting “tkesa, Ordal
priester, zu struere, bauen maurern.”® “Ordalgenosse, Ordalmeister, Or
dalkollegium, Ordalseance, Ordalszenerie, Ordalurteil, Ordalregel,
Ordalbegriff, Ordaltechnik, Ordalbutter, Ordalverbum” etc., all this
“Ordalterminologie” are exciting, empty words. I once was the only
foreign guest at a military dinner given by the commanding general
in honor of the occupant of the Djamshid throne, which passed in com
plete silence. When the kamkartar patixsay at last rose from the table,
he mrned to me and said, over the head of our host, perfectly to the
point: I suppose that was the worst dinner you ever had in your life!
And while I stuttered some answer, he called to the minister of the

court: Repeat it to him in French! That one could call an “ordeal
seance.”
The same constituent methods of judicial procedure Zoroaster as
sumes also for the last judgment, and wherever he uses some of these
terms in the gatha, the last judgment is the subject.
The gathas mention three kinds of ordeals:
yam da manyu a^raca rtaca cois ranobya xsnutam
“the hearing, that Thou as (Spanta)manyus ordainest by fire,
and (which) as Rtam Thou hast constituted, cois^ for the two parties,

Xsnut, as a derivative, “Belohnung (reward) in gutem und bosem
Sinne.” Others tone it down to “Vergeltung, requital,” merely masking
the offence: the ordeal is neither reward nor punishment. Vx^nu
means always “to hear,” like NP. sunudan, and “xsnut, hearing.” The
procedure of inquiry is a trial by ordeal ; both parties submit to it, receive

parties,” but a metaphor taken from the two litigants in court, for
“pious and sinners,” to be distinguished only by the ordeal.
Y.32,7 contains three entirely obscure hapax: ojoi, hadroya
and ]oya. For the first two lines one must compare 32,6: “ena
yais sravahyati, the misdeeds for which epics are sung to them”
and 32,8; “esam enaham vivahuso sravi yamascit, among those
villains (or: for such misdeeds) Yama V. of all is praised,” see
under ‘Yama ^seta.’ Therefore, “yais sravi” refers to “mis
deeds,” “that are testified, made notorious—as joya?—by the
hvena ayaha, ordeal.” The knowing god is speaking, sanhate,
through the ordeal. Last line: “What they have left behind,
rixta. Thou A.M. knowest best.” rixta, to Vric-, rek-, lin
quere, (hereditate re)lictum, “left” property—cf. re^nah “heri
tage” in 32,11 under ‘Maga’—is in general the balance of men’s
good and evil actions. The verses evidently oppose the testimony
of the “most knowing god,” yesam tu ri^tam vedisto ahi, to
the ignorance of men, esam enaham necit vidva, as the Pahl.
transl. understands: “avesan kenik ne.cic akas, expl. ce cand
ne danend.” Cf. Y.32,7: “he who knows shall not defend them,”
under ‘Yama xseta.’ “necit vidva” may mean “even though un
knowingly.” As far as the verses are intelligible, they forbid
Bartholomae’s translation: “keine von diesen Unthaten soil der

Gewinnes, der wie bekannt durch das lohende Metall kund
wird, i.e. der Metallstrom beim Jiingsten Gericht,” which
sounds as if somebody might try to reach paradise by illicit
means.
The three ordeals are: a^ra suxra, by red fire; hvena ayaha, by red
hot brass; ayaha xsusta, by molten brass, certainly nothing to inspire
rapture or ecstasy.
Y.31,19:
0wa a^ra suxra mazda vahau vidata ranaya
“(when) through Thy red fire, M., the vahau of the two parties will be
established.”



LAST JUDGMENT 295
Y.47,6:
ta da spanta manyu mazda ahura
a^ra vahau vidatim ranobya
“as Spanto manyus, o. A.M., through fire, Thou ordainest the vahau
vidatim, establishing of guilt or innocence for both parties.”
Bartholomae (PTA) explained “vidati” with loc.sg. “vahau”
as “Einweisung (installation) auf das Guthaben (in the sum
due to him) —in gutem und iiblem Sinne—wie es sich beim
Abschluss der Buchungen, da^ra (closing of accounts) er
giebt.”® He failed to see that the verses do not speak of passing
sentence, but of collecting evidence. The primary meaning of
vi-da- is “to establish”: \''da-=T^0^J/x^, prev. vi-, Lat. dis-, im
ports “in detail”; the word comes near to “analyze, examine.”
It is the activity of the examining magistrate, inquiry, hiayvSivai
of the vi.ciro, and the Pahl. transl. “giving vicarisn” is right:
ascertain guilt or innocence. Therefore, vahau cannot be a loc.
sg., but only a dual, corresponding to “rana, the two parties,”
“sava, the two returns” (cf. hvafna, the two sleeps), hence
“vahau, the two goods, their good and bad actions,” the balance
both parties “leave behind.”
In Y.48, the train of thought is: St.i, when Rtam will have defeated
dru^s, the deva and martiya, Oeoi re Pporoi re, receive their “sava, two
returns, good and evil.” The victory of the good principle at the end
of the “mixed world” is a fact, not conditional; to achieve it, all men
must “choose rtam,” vi.ci^a in Y.30,2, under ‘Ya-ahi!’ or swear to it,
Vvar-. St.2: The human bearers, rtavan and drugvant, replace the
powers rtam and druxs: “Announce to me, A.M. who knowest what
shall come: will the rtavan defeat the drugvant before the atonement,
pr^a, which Thou hast planned ?” The atonement, payment, takes place
at the Last Judgment which is part of the primal plan of the god. St.2
ends:
ha zi ahos vahvi vista akrtis
“That is: the good akrtis of the world has taken place!” or imprecative:
® Bartholomae refers to the verb vida>a- in y.43,12 and 34,12, to which Wb.j2z attributes six meanings, a different one to each place. For the two places quoted “etwas verteilen an,” the same error as in the translation of the noun.



296 LAST JUDGMENT
“that would be the transfiguration, the end of the struggle of good and
evil.”
Bartholomae: “Das ware ja gewiss eine der Welt frommende
Botschaft!” or alternatively: “das ist bekannt als.” Lommel:
“Denn das ist bekannt als die gute Gestaltung des Daseins,”
note: “Andreas; akrtis, cf. OL akrti, aussere Form, Gestalt.”
Why should Zoroaster ask, if it was “bekannt, a known fact” ?
vista cannot belong to Wid-, “to know.” Nyberg attaches it to
VVid-, but his translation “befunden” means “judged, ascer
tained as,” whereas V'vid- is “to find, obtain,” pass, “to take
place.” Vkar- with prev. a is “to make into something.” Wb.
puts a.krnam, with obj. nmanam, in Vid.22,1, under Vkart-,
“durch Schneiden gestalten,” meaning “to shape into some
thing.” The words are synonymous. Here, the existing world
is made into another one, hence “a.krti= transfiguration.” ‘krsti
< kart- would have a bad connotation: to fake.
The question means: “Will the victory of the religion, of good over
evil, become a reality while the world lasts, before its end The double
signification of the “Coming of the Kingdom” is the same as in earliest
Christianity.
The problem is inherent in every doctrine that teaches a final com
pensation in the hereafter. Nobody can teach: We live in the year 3030,
after 5,970 years you will rise from your tombs to be judged! The
founder of the religion believes that he brings the kingdom of heaven,
not only an era." The kingdom must come in the lifetime of the genera
tion that hears the promise: “bodanto pad! you shall live to see!” And
it is significant that Zoroaster speaks only of “rtavan” and does not dis
tinguish, as Xerxes does soon after, between “syata in life, rtavan in
death.” Only after the prophet’s time the contradiction between a
resurrection at the end of days and the passing into the beyond at death
becomes apparent. Various solutions are tried; for instance in the late
Art. Vir.Nam,XYiii: The tortured soul of the sinner in hell says “ ’mt hi
YVM v sp’n YHvvN.t YMNNVN.yt ’yk, when only three days and nights
have elapsed, ix m snt bvndk YHv\Tsr.t ’p.m br’ l’ ssKV’N.d, the 9,000

years are completed, and yet they will not release me!” There, reward
and punishment begin with death, and punishment even comes to an
end with time, with the beginning of eternity.
The notion, Zoroaster expresses by “akrtis, transfiguration,” is clearer
in Y.30,9, see under ‘Myastra’:
atca toi vayam hyama yoi im frasam krnavan ahum
“and we will be those who make this world here frasam!” This is what
a “sosyant, saviour” does, and on this and a few similar passages rests
the later doctrine of the sdsyant. Andreas translated “die dies Leben
zu einem herrlichen (oder: Wunder) gestalten,” nggw, 1909. A whole
literature grew up around this note.^“ I too allowed myself to be misled
and corrected the error only in Altp.lnschr. s.v.: frasam means solely
“beyond,” always used with ellipsis, “beyond (the post, the target etc.).”
frasa -h A^kar- is originally a term of racing; as such it formed frasa
kara, as epithet of Vrthragna in Y/.i4,28 and as n.pr. in Y/.i3,io2. The
moment of which Zoroaster speaks is the last day of history, when the
world has finished its ninth round, when time stops and eternity
begins. From the verbal idiom frasam krnavan in Y.30,9 the Aw. abstr.
noun frasakrti has been derived in analogy to akrti. frasakrti “the mak
ing-beyond” is no good model of a word and occurs only once in the
Awesta, in a gloss interpolated at the end of the old verses Yf. 13,57

see under ‘Fravarti’—^behind rvesam: “yam frasakrtoit vahviya.” It is
the “good” frasakrti, like the “good” akrti, frasasti. Actually, MP.
fraskirt has been coined after “frasam krnavan” and has been trans
posed into a learned Aw. frasakrti. Pahl. tak fraskirt zaman means
“ila yaumi 1-qiyama, till resurrection day,” syn. of apatiyarakih “state of
no-more-being-contested.” It is the counterpart of the notion expressed
in FiJ.2,20 (see under ‘Chronology’): “3,000 years spiritual existence
and 3,000 years material existence without antagonism; then comes
patiyarakih, contest: 3,000 years from the beginning of human history
to the coming of the religion, and another 3,000 years to the last judg
ment,” after which apatiyarakih reigns.
Zoroaster speaks many times, in singular and plural, of the sosyant,
^^Lommei, zii, 1,30; H. Junker, in “Wortcr u. Sachen,” xii, i32f.; Duchesne, Comp. At'. §78: “frasam ‘splendide,’ clabii par Andreas.”



298 LAST JUDGMENT
whereas notion and word do not appear—as even a glance at the ar
rangement of the places in shows—in any old passage of the
yashtsd^ It appears only in Y^.i9,88ff., post-Zoroastrian verses describing
their activity at the resurrection. St.92,a-c are the beginning of this song,
88,c-i its end. The same verses recur in Yr.19,11 and i3£E.
The formula by which the verses are inserted into the Hvarnah yasht
at the mazdayasnian redaction, is: “We worship the hvarnah, which
follows (belongs to) nn, in order that he may . . . i.e. “and which
enables him to. . . In st.ii AhuraMazdah who needs no “kavian
hvarnah” to create the living beings, is the n.n. To this the words “yat
krnavan frasam ahum” are ungrammatically appended, which imitate
Y.30,9, “that they (viz. the sosyant who are dropped at this place) make
the world frasam.” In Y/.i9,i3ff. the verses are appended, likewise
unbefittingly, to the Amrta Spanta. In 88f. the same introductory for
mula is used, with hvarnah, but the nn is not the god nor the immortal
holy ones, but
yat upa.hacat sosyantam vr^rajanam
uta anyascit haxayo yat krnavat frasam ahum
“the hvarnah that belongs to the varthragnian sosyant and his other
companions, that he (sg.) make the world frasam.” He needs the hvar
nah no more than AhuraMazdah, and the non-Zoroastrian epithet
“varthragnian,” which brings the relationship of the hvarnah (not of
the sosyant) to the god Vrthragna into prominence, is added only to
adapt the originally independent verses to the hvarnah yasht, to which
they did not belong. In 88 and 91 the hvarnah-formula is twice inter
polated, tearing the original asunder and forcing the insertion of a “yat”
that spoils the meter. Yr.19,11 and 13 may be left alone as mere repeti
tion, out of place, of the original in 88. The verses themselves are dis
figured by a few additions, but have suffered neither changes nor omis
sions. The line “uta anyascit haxayo” must be admitted, because the
plural of the verb krnavan, grammatically faulty in iia, is not intro
duced directly from Y.30,9 in Yr.19,11, but in the “Song to the Sosyant”
which was taken over as a whole, and became faulty only when the
subject was changed from the plural to sg. AhuraMazd^. Thus the
original verses were:
“ About the insertion o£ their names in the memorial list of Yr.13 see that chapter.

Herodotus 111,62, in the story of Cambyses and Prexaspes renders the
thought of these verses by: el jiev vvv ot reOveaiTe^ avuTTacri [yat rista

prjSov, faulty gloss of Herodotus) eiravaxTTrjcrecrdai [astvat.rto frahis
tate]. The whole notion was too foreign for Herodotus to understand
it rightly, a cogent proof that he did not invent the story, but heard it
from the best source. The name astvat.rta [Median, OP. *astva.rta,
^Ao-Tuaprrjv] is derived from Y.43,16, end of Gath.ust.: astvat rtam
hiyat ustana ojahvat, and means Rtam in human shape. The Achae
menid name ’O^vap-n)^^^ i.e. vaxsyat.rta, OP. vaxsya.rta, name of the
second sosyant, attests that the tripling of the sosyant was known in
about 420 B.C., and Herodotus’ words, about 440 b.c., project that con
ception back into Cambyses’ time, 529-523 b.c. The time of the ‘Song
to the Sosyant’ is the middle or second half of the 5th century. At that
time the n.abstr. “frasakrtis, the making-beyond” was not yet in use.
In Mah Frav. and some other Sasanian works, the name uxsyat.rta
IS spelled x^Rsytr, revealing how these eschatological speculations
worked. The Gr.Bdh. pzf., speaking of the “var i avinast, the sinless
lake” which—since avinast replaces an^ita as epithet of Ardvi, e.g.
Gr.Bdh.%2.—is another name for the “source of Ardvisura, the immacu

the same kind as that of a god of thunder setting the world ablaze by
his lightning.
“adaySyamna, undeceivable” is a frequent epithet of Mithra, and
once, in Y/.io,8o, he is called “me^anahya pata, keeper of the farm
yard.” The compound ‘pa^ra.me^ana lives on in the n.pr. p’tmytn,
on a Sasanian seal in the Calcutta Museum. Both are divine epithets,
fitting Hvar^seta as well as Mithra. In Gr.Bdh.i^ and Dat.Den.,
Pisyo^na, son of Vistaspa (YA13) has the epithet pa^romehan (cor
rupted into as immortal helper of the sosyant. The Den\. ix,40
says: “Pa^romehan, also called Pisyo^n,” and the Bahman Yt. speaks
of “Pa^romehan, son of Vistasp.”
Hvarci^ra, son of Zoroaster (Y/.13), another helper of the sosyant,
is called in Gr.Bdh.2i’^ “the artestar, knight, spahsalar, commander of
the army of Pisyo^na, son of Vistaspa.” The posthumous career of the
historical Pisisyo^na, after eschatology had taken hold of him, is that
he disappears behind his surname pa^ra.me^ana, originally a surname
of the gods Mithra and Hvar^seta, while Hvarci^ra—i.e. xyrstr>
xvrsytr, as if it be a comparative of xvrsyt—takes the place of Hvar,
the sun—like Sas. manusci^ra for manus—and disappears behind the
coalescent names of uxsyat.rta and hvar.^seta. The actual process was
that the legend substituted these human figures for gods of an older
period, conferring upon them the divine epithets, and that these old
epithets survive, clearly revealing a much older phase of thought, where
gods like Mithra, Hvar^seta, Anahita and Vrthragna took part in the
final eKTrvpwcrt? of the world.
The name of the lake Kansaviya, mod. Hamun, is derived from an
unknown ‘kansu. From the Kansaviya rises mount Usidam, as the
meaning of the name, “house of dawn” shows, originally a mythical
Messina, Orientalia 1,2,15, misunderstood my old remark in ami 11,57 on this passage of the Bdh. that had escaped attention- ‘I’afferniazione riguardante il sole (as sosyant) si fonda sopra una etimologia del termine usetar-xsarjetar etc.” I never considered an etymological connecDon of and uxsyat.rta.

LAST JUDGMENT 3OI
mountain imagined at the east point of the border of the Ocean, but at
the time of the verses of Yt.ig already located at the hill in the lake,
the modern Koh i Xvaja, “mountain of the Lord,” whose name was,
in modern belief, Sara i Ibrahim, i.e. a son of Ibrahim Zardust. It is
regarded as holy, and is the only mountain invoked as “yazata, adoran
dus” in many yashts. Moreover, in the same yasht 19, in st.66, verses
are inserted which give a detailed description of the Sealand with the
lake, the mountain in the lake, and the ten rivers which fall into
the lake, the like of which is not given of any other country in the
Awesta. A commentary of this description is the Awdihd e Sigistdn,
“Mirabilia of Sistan.”
Thfe placenames in the epical fragments quoted in the great yashts are
motivated by the action of the mythical heroes. The placenames in the
description of the sunrise in Yt.io, equally, have a good historical and
geographical reason. The description of the Sealand has no motive
and no connection with other things, it is simply the description of a
country as a Holy Land. The saviour, expected from there, is a reincar
nation of Zoroaster, his son [Sara i Ibrahim Zardust, in Mdh Frav.
Zoroaster himself]. I do not believe that a prophet can be expected to
return as saviour from any special place or country, unless he has been
there.^® Therein I see the reason for the peculiar holiness and, with it,
the description of the country in the Awesta. Zoroaster actually so
journed there.
On the weird table mountain of basalt in the lake, one cannot “als
Missionar wirken” (Nyberg), but only live as a hermit, perhaps with
a few pupils. I stayed there twice, altogether four months. It is a place
provoking visions like no other one. The Indian ascetics used to go
“in the forest,” the Arabian “into the desert,” the Iranian “on the moun
tain,” for instance Sasan according to ibn al-Balkhi, Fdrsn. 54,11;
Vistaspa according to Baidawi, nizam, a passage which comes from the
Iran. ‘Zamaspnamak and, by its Greek translation, the XpTjo-ei? ‘Ycrrd

taspa, and under his protection Zoroaster sojourned there as a hermit.
He speaks of this hermit life in the ‘Gatha of the Vision,’ Y.43,15:
daxsat usyai tusnamatis vahista
“Thinking in silence has taught me to announce . .
Lommel’s attempt to connect usyai with Skr. “ucyati, to like to do”
{Orient.Stud.Favry, aSiff.) is no improvement: one thinks in silence
considering what one wants to say. As to the form cf. Y.32,4 : *vasyante
devazuka, text: vaxsante. Mount Usidam is the place of the Gatha of
the vision. Zoroaster’s sojourn on the mountain is the origin of the
traditions told in the Mirabilia, also of the notes on Sena Ahumsmt
“from Bust” in western Arachosia, and that Bust was founded when
Vistaspa, at lake Frazdan (Zirih), created the religious law, in Sahr.Er.
It is also the reason, long since forgotten, for the pilgrimages, attested
since the fourth century a.d. and still performed today during the first
fortnight after the Zoroastrian Nauroz, to the Koh i Xvaja, the moun
tain of the Lord.
The gatha Y.48—with “akrtis”—speaks of the last judgment, not of
an “Ordal das Zarathustras Religionsstreit entscheiden soil” (Nyherg,
227). I do not know whether Bartholomae was the first, or somebody
before him, to ascribe to Zoroaster the Middle Iranian concept of the
last judgment as a “destroying and purifying stream of fire” (see under
‘Welcome’). The end of the world in fire, caused by lightning, is a
thought of the oldest stratum of the myth; Zoroaster’s concept, on the
contrary, is the judgment, as all the verses here already quoted express,
and very clearly the Gatha ustavati, 43,5-6 (see Markwart’s translation)
5: damois rvese apame

After the last rvesa, the last turn of the nine millennia, AhuraMazdah
appears as SpantoManyus and in all his aspects, xsa^ra, vahu manaha;
Armatis pronounces the sentences of the undeceivable knowledge and
will of the supreme judge.



LAST JUDGMENT 3O3
For this last judgment the dead will rise, us.hikan, Y/.i9,88; the
verb, with us- and pati, used with the ablative, e.g. up from the sea,
from the bed, means originally “from the graves” see under ‘Videvdad.’
The reward after death, for good and evil actions in life, is Zoroaster’s
fundamental thought, expressed in every single gatha, and equally
in Darius’ inscription Beh. §§73 and 76, and Xerxes’ daiva, Persepolis.
The entire dualistic concept of the world rests on this thought. Resur
rection, being the necessary premise of the judgment, is the unavoidable
consequence of reward, an integrant part of Zoroaster’s doctrine.
Prexaspes speaks doubting—“if”—to Cambyses; but Darius and Xerxes
believe in Zoroaster’s doctrine of resurrection.
Nyberg says, 310: “Der Auferstehungsgedanke ist in den Gathas mit
keinem Worte beriihrt; mehr, es fehlen alle Voraussetzungen, die
Vereinigung der Seele in der Ekstase mit der himmlischen Welt hat die
Todesvorstellung vollkommen uberwogen.” “Heavenly world” is a
‘ Vorstellung-concept”; “ecstasy” is a mere “Vorstellung-imagination”
of Nyberg; death is neither conception nor imagination, but a fact, the
most stubborn, that nothing can “overweigh.” “Wenn die Himmels
reise der Seele der alles beherrschende Gedanke gegenuber dem Tode
ist [it is not] —so giebt es keinen Boden fiir den Auferstehungsge
danken,” a conclusion that would be wrong even if the premise were
true. “Zoroaster borrowed from the tribe among which he founded
his community, den auf die Erdbestattung begriindeten fravasi Kult
and den darin wurzelnden und ohne ihn nicht denkbaren (unthink
able) Auferstehungsglauben,” which was however “nichtsdestoweniger
natiirlich eine kiihne Neuschdpfung grossen Stils.” Whence comes such
knowledge, when no word as much as touches the subject, and why did
Zoroaster do so, when there was no “Voraussetzung, premise” and no
‘Boden, premises” to build on } Zoroaster never mentions the Fravarti
in the gathas; more than that, in his ‘Creation Gatha’ he describes
AhuraMazdah in their old cosmologic role, that means, he rejected the
popular notion of these “manes.”
In the whole Fravardin Yasht, 13, see under ‘Fravarti,’ there is no
hint of any transfigured life. On the contrary, the “tusnisad, those who
sit, live in silence,” continue to act on earth as dead ones. The same
concept prevails in Greece and Italy, and since the Ir. fravarti are also
female “valcyries,” this is the primeval Indo-European concept of



304 LAST JUDGMENT
existence after death. Pre-Zoroastrian and Zoroastrian notion are totally
different and clearly distinguished.
The cult of the fravarti, the OI. pitarah, Greek “heroes,” Roman
“manes,” depends in no way on the special and varying modes of dis
posing of the body, nor these different funerary customs on that cult.
Whatever is done to the body, the “ustana, life” which has left the
“astvant body,” does not die, but lives, somehow bound to the place
where the material shape rests, with which it was endowed. Nor is
there any connection between the funerary customs, v.’hatever they
were, and Zoroaster’s idea of resurrection, which does not “root in the
Fravarti cult, founded on and ‘unthinkable’ without interment.” “Es ist
keinen Augenblick daran zu denken”—one ought to have a minute of
thought for everything—“dass der Zoroastrismus [means; after Zoro
aster’s death] eine solche Grabsitte iibernommen hatte, die er zu alien
Zeiten mit dem grossten Abscheu betrachtete,” another revelation, since
the yashts are just as silent as the gathas. A minute of thought and
many things “unthinkable” become thinkable; but coexistence of trans
figured life and life in silence is indeed unthinkable, as is a “borrowed
thought, and yet a bold new creation in grand style.” As remarked
above, the word pati us.histan presupposes “rising up from tombs.”
Zoroaster’s picture of the last judgment is that of a court, of a settling
of accounts, hankrti. Y.3 1,14: “ya^a ta ahan hankrta hiyat, when it
comes to settling accounts.” The good and evil acts are put to account,
their balance is the rixta, which is “left” behind.
y.32,7:
yesam tu ahura ri^tam mazda vedisto ahi
“what they have left. Thou, A.M., knowest best!”
Y.44,2:
ho zi rta spanto ri^tam vispabyo haro manyu
“He, the holy one, . . . who regards in spirit what every one has left
behind.” Ahura means lord justiciary, mazda “to bear in one’s mem
ory”; the verses paraphrase the name of the god as “the omniscient
judge,” not as “der Weise Herr.”



LAST JUDGMENT 305
y.49,4:
yeHm noit hvarkais vans duzvarsta
“whose good works do not make level the bad ones.” Pahl. transh:
“ku.s kirpak vinas be ne kanet, whose good deeds do not make even

is (equally?) mixed?”, cf. Art.Vir.Ndm.s’i, chapter ‘Hamestakan’ : ke.
san kirpak u vinas rast but, those whose good and evil deeds are even.^®
All terms are clearly such of accounting and the beginning of the no
tion “zero.” Bartholomae translated 49,44 “bei denen nicht die Gut
thaten (sondern) die Ubelthaten iiberwiegen,” as sole instance of
intrans. \'Van-, “superare”; it is OP. \ A’an- “fill, heap up” said of
“^ika, gravel, pebbles, calculi.” Counting pebbles is the beginning of
“calculare, calculate.” Calculating and weighing are intimately con
nected. The picture of an account takes the form of a banking house
in heaven in the later notion of the “ganj i hamisa su8, the treasure of
eternal interest.”
The origin of the whole conception is the old custom, inherited from
Babylon, to keep written records of everything the king did and or
dered; examples are found among the tablets from Persepolis. The word
for these records is “hypomnimata, memorandum,” in Ezra 6,2: dkrvn’,
NP. yad.dast. From these deeds the ephemerids were excerpted, the
^L/3Xi.a vTTOfjLVTjfiaTLo-fidiv, spr dkrvny’ in Ezra 4,15, spr hzkrnvt in
Esther 6,1, explained in 2,33 by “spr dbry hymym, deeds of daily acts.”
Excerpts from longer periods were the ^acrtXiKal 8 i(f>04pai, deposited in
the byt gzny’, the “archives” (not “treasure-house”). The “garo dmana,
house of collecting” is the heavenly counterpart of these earthly archives.
Special merits to the king were recorded like his own actions, and the
honorific (OP.) opocrayyai, Gr. evepyirai was conferred upon such
men. Herodotus viii,85: “Phylakos was recorded as Euergetes of the
king.” Xerxes writes to Pausanias, Thukydides 1,129,3: “Regarding the
men from Byzantium whom you have saved for me beyond the sea, the
evepyecria lies booked for you in our house for ever!” And Darius
speaks similarly in the Gadatas inscription (Dittenberger, Syll. n“ 22).
Markwart tried an etymology of opocrayyai together with rrapa
NP. ba zamiin rast kart, e.g. BaidawT, nizdm, twice: Bu^tnassar makes bait al-maqdis, Jcrut>aiem, “even with the earth.”

gischem Antrieb, Schaffensdrang” is a misleading translation; vrziya
hvaho in the Homa-verses ¥.10,14 naeans “in full possession of one’s
senses” as opp. to “drunk.” The Gr. translation is as precise as possible
:
ev < hu, epyo? < vrzyah “work(ing)”; existing compounds with dus
can be paralleled by such with hu-, hence ‘hu.varzyah. There was a
noun ‘sravanha, deriv. of sravah, of which sravanhyati is the denom.
verb ; similarly Aw. uposanhva, deriv. of upa.usah, MP. Posang. Hence,
the deriv. ‘huvrzyanhva gives opoadyyai.
Y.29,4:
mazda "’sahvar.maristo ya zi vavrzoi paricitit
devaisca martiyaisca yaca varsate apicitit
ho viciro ahuro a^a ahat yaca ho vasat
“Mazdah is the best witness-rememberer of what is wrought in the past
by gods and men and of what is wrought in future. He is the justiciary
who judges, His will be done!”
What AhuraMazdah remembers or calculates are the actions of men,
recorded with attest in the archives. The wordly institution is trans
ferred to heaven.
sahvar maristo is written in two words, so that the relative clauses
“which have been” and “which will be wrought” refer to sahvar; this
would be an acc.pl. with the meaning restricted to “actions, inten
tions.” But Bartholomae’s “Anschlag, Plan, eigtl. Ankiindigung (eines
Vorhabens),” Meillet’s doubtful “indications.?” (“Anschlag” would be
“plot”), do not fit V sanh-, OP. ^ah-, pronuntiare, authoritative or solemn
speaking. The Pahl. commentary says : “pa vinas u kirpak amar kunet, he
keeps account of sin and good deeds.” The same words are used for the
compound hata.marani in Y.32,6, all but a synonym, “merit! memor.”
sahvar must be freed of the relative clauses, therefore be read as com
pound, like hata.marani, cf. also naka.razista in Y^.io, under ‘Mithra.’
It is a super!, of *sahvar.mar(ant). The relative clauses, then, relate to
the participle: “the best rememberer or accountant of what has been
done etc.”



LAST JUDGMENT 307
The Pahl. txansl. of sahvar by sxvn is right. In “sanhate, pro
nunciatur” is used for the “deposition, speaking” of the ordeal ; equally
Den]{. uses “gowisn = sahvan” for the “speaking, testimony” of the
ordeal. Y.31,5: “hyat rvatam cazdahvabyo,” Y.44,5: “ya mano^ris caz
dahvantam ar^ahya,” where rvata, OI. vrata—cf. Ir. rvata, priTov—is
“sentence” in the juridical meaning; “ar0a,” here “daily task,” but also
juridical term. Pahl. transl. of cazdahvant is both times “amar vicartar,
who determines the number”; Geldner translated “berechnend,” refer
ring to Ved. kiyedhas. The “number” is obviously the “amount” of
punishment, “amar vicartar” combines the two words of 29,4, (sahvar)
mar(isto) and viciro (ahuro). Therefore, “sahvar, spoken word” is the
deposition of witnesses, the attestation of the action, “marant” means
“mental arithmetic,” a “marant” is a “hamara.kara, accountant.”
The idea of Y.29,4 resembles Thales’
aroclicOTaTOV 6 xpovo<; . dpevpicTKei. yap Trdvra,
which again returns in the zurvanistic saying in Gr.Bdh.
zaman adawakan adawaktar

Time is the most undeceivable of undeceivables.
Time is the greatest inquisitor of inquisitors.
Bartholomae was right in speaking of “heavenly book-keeping.”
Nyberg objects, 21 1: “Woher sollten die Rinderhirten der Steppe, die
keine Ahnung von der Schrift batten, . . . den Gedanken an himm
lische Geschaftsbiicher genommen haben ?” The book-keeping cannot
be denied; the “cowboys of the prairie” are a mere theory. The book
keeping is not absurd, but the cowboys are. The Iranian bureaucracy
came from their Babylonian neighbors.
Zoroaster’s thought of the judgment as account passed into the other
religions. Daniel 12,1: “Thy people will be saved, all those who are
written down in the book.” Or Daniel 7,10, vision of the judgment
of the four beasts: “The court set, the books were opened.” The vision
was conceived in Babylon under the Achaemenids, that is place and
time where Zoroastrian thoughts went over into Judaism and thence
mto Christianity, and thus influenced universal history.
Enoch, 92-104, in the treatise on resurrection: “For the spirits that



3o8 last judgment
died in justice everything good ... is written down as reward,” and
“The sinner may say [Y/.io,io5 : i^a manyate dus.hvarna]: Our sins
will not be investigated and recorded [noit imat vispam dusvarkam
mi^ro venati . . . ] ; and yet, the angels write down all your sins every
day!”—Islam, too, borrowed the idea: “athabahu Allahu wa-da‘afa lahu
1-hasanat wa-dja‘ala dhukhrahu 1-baqiyyatu 1-salihat, Allah reward him
and double him his charities and make him a treasure of good works!”
And Qur. 9,5 : “Allahu khabiru bima ya‘maluna” is word by word
“Mazda sahvar.mmisto ya zi vavrzoi.”

“Still it cried: sleep no more! Glamis has murdered sleep And therefore Cawdor shall sleep no more!”
Y.45,2: “The good one of the two manyu prviya, primordial spirits,
said to the bad one: Neither our mana, nor our sanha, ^tatavo, varna,
u^Sa, syo^na, dena, ruvano join, hacante.”
“Spirits” is no accurate rendering of manyu; they are something
spiritual, nothing concrete; they speak, but they are neither anthro
pomorphous, nor theomorphous. The best translation would be “the
two forces” or “principles,” Good and Evil.
Lommel: “Nicht unser beider Denken, . . . Reden, . . . Verstand
(Wille?), . . . Wahlentscheidung, . . . Worte, noch Thaten, . . . geistige
Natur, . . . Seelen gehen zusammen.” The eight hardly definable notions
cannot be really translated: complexes of phenomena are compressed
in single words, and there are not two languages where these coincide,
because the notions behind the words are no realities. One could say
“thought, sayings, will, love, words, deeds, essence, soul.” It is not yet
a psychologic system like that which Mani developed from beginnings
already foreshadowed in Darius’ tomb inscription, cf. Altp.lnschr. 841!.
The eight words have the same purport as KapS'n]. ^vxv> Stai'ota in the
Gospels. The definition of “ruvan, soul” in the Gr.Bdh. is elucidating:
“Soul is what by the senses in the body sees, speaks, and perceives,”
or “the soul is the master over the body, like the chief of the family
over his house, the horseman over his horse, it is the rayenitar, patron,
of the body.” It is the same with Gr. /rews, Lat. mentes,
sententiae, animi or Hebr. iu''h = -irv€vpLa, memra = Xdyo?, khokhma =
<ro(f)ia. The verses seek to convey; in all the faculties and motives of our
spiritual life, we, Spantamanyus and Ahramanyus, Good and Evil, are
incompatible, unreconcilable opposites.
The verses do not say that good and evil were “twins,” not even in a
figurative sense. The “Gatha of Good and Evil” is Y.30, and there the
expression “the two principles” appears once more.
A chapter in Den\. ix (statement of contents of the VarstmansrNask,
ch.7) has been interpreted as being a sort of exegesis to y.30,3-5, cf.



310 YAMA
Schaeder, Beitr'dge 288 and Benveniste, in Monde Or. 26,207!?. Trans
lations and inferences therefrom are both erroneous. One must read
(cf. Altplnschr. 130); “ac avesan amuhraspand[an] an e vattar dosit,
lit. he [viz. the demon Aras of whom the paragraph speaks] chose the
worse share than the Am.Sp.” i.e. the share worse than that chosen by
the Am.Sp., or better; “in opposition to the Am.Sp. the wholly-bad
share,” “pat.an ka.s ^snasakan dev^ ayazisnih guft, in teaching: those
who know shall worship the dev !” and “bring offerings to the planetary
gods!” These gods are not Xursed, Mah, Tir etc., but astral gods im
ported from Babylon. Nothing can be gathered from this paragraph
for the interpretation of y.30.
Y-30>3:
at ta manyu prviye ya yama hvafna asruvatam

“But those two primordial manyu that are praised in song as the
‘sleep-twins’ are Good and Evil, in thoughts, words and conduct. And
between these two [Good and Evil] the good-minded have chosen
right, the not-ill-minded.”
Bartholomae: “Die beiden Geister zu Anfang, die sich dutch
ein Traumgesicht als Zwillinge offenbarten, (sind) das Bessere
und das Bose in Gedanken, Worten und That.” Ar.Forschg.
11,120: “Dass die beiden Urgeister Zwillinge genannt werden,
ist gewiss auffallig.” In fact, it is only “the two sleeps” that are
called so. At that time, he translated hu.afna asruvatam still by
“sie (dual) schufen kunstreich.”
Andreas, nggw, 1909, 48; “Jene beiden . . . Geister, die die
selbstherrlichen Zwillinge heissen,” an interpretation that can
not be maintained.
One must not render the Iranian by the German (or English)
comparative: “the better” would be “better than bad,” the lesser
evil, while it is a comp. abs. “the wholly good”; vahya comes
near to Aristotle’s avroayaOov. “ya . . . asruvatam” is a relative
clause, but does not signify “which ... are called”; it is no
parenthesis, and all the less signifies “as has been transmitted”
(Nyberg, below); it says “who have been praised in song,” in



YAMA 3II
perf.pres. “who are praised in the epic,” see under ‘Poetry’ and
‘Yama x^eta.’
Bartholomae compared the dual “the two sleeps” with “sava,
the two returns,” viz. reward and punishment. Other analogies
are “rana, pious and sinners,” “vahu, good and evil,” see under
‘Last Judgment’; also “dva nara” in a human pair,
man and woman; “hvar^e” in Y/.ip, eating and drinking. The
dual means “sleep and its brother.”^
The manifestations of spiritual life are usually combined in the stereo
typed formula “manah, vacah, syo^na,” from which the three virtues
originate: “humat, huxt, huvarst, good thought, talk, conduct.” This
most natural idea is found all over the world, in Christianity and earlier,
e.g. Democritus: to ev koyi^eaBat, to ev Xeyeiv, to irpaTTeiv a Set or
yiveTaL Se Ik tov cfipovelv Tpia Tovra ' ^ovXeoecrdai KaXal?, Xiyeiv

Xenophanes says merely “form and thought”:
€15 0609 € 1' T€ dvr]Totcn Kal avdpdiTTOlCTL peyCCTTO'S
ovT€ 8€p.a<i dvT)Tolcn o/aoio9 ovre v6Tqp,a
The triad always means the total of functions of the soul. Corpses
that neither think, nor speak, nor act, are beyond good and evil. The
eight manifestations of the soul in Y.45,2 have the same purport as this
triad.
The mere mention of the dual-name is enough to remind the hearers
of the myth which they knew as well as that of Yama Vivahvato pu^ro,
to whom epics are sung, sravahyati,” and of other heroes, not from
lectures at a theological seminary, but from the old epic tales, “yais
asrozdvam bumya hafta^e, sung on this seventh of the earth,” Y.32,3,
in the whole of Eransahr. Cf. Xenophanes:

to everybody, he does not detail any further—a new ethical interpreta
tion: “Your epics speak of the primordial twins sleep and his brother; I
speak of the two principles Good and Evil.” They are two different
pairs.
Y.30,4:
atca hyat ta ham manyu jasetam prviyam dazde
gayamca ajyatimca ya0a{ca) ahat apaman ahus
acisto drugvatam at rtavane vahikam mano
“When these two spirits [Good and Evil, which I have compared in st.3
with your twins, and defined in my gatha 45,2] came together, they
first established life and death, how it shall be at the end: hell, for the
drugvant, but paradise for the rtavan.”
That is the passage which Ed. Meyer, following Bartholomae’s “they
agreed” for ham.jasetam, believed to prove that Zoroaster himself knew
already the “agreement” of 9,000 years between AhuraMazdah and
Ahramanyus, of which Plutarch, de Iside, speaks. The number 9,000,
though not uttered, may have been in Zoroaster’s mind, but the form
is not that of a treaty. The “ham.jasetam, coming together” is neither
procreation nor a compromise, as Bartholomae interpreted the sentence
in Ar.Forschg. 11,122: “Lat. convenire, iibereinkommen, weil sie schon
beisammen waren.” The words of the Gr.Bdh. “u.san miyan tuhikih
but, hast ke vay goyend, between them was a void, others say the atmos
phere” are wrong speculations of Sasanian theologians who thought of
creation instead of history, “ahu” is the period of “patiyarak, contest.”
The address by the good principle is the challenge, the false twins were
not together, but come together for battle, the Trar^p airdvrcov, cf. Yt.
1447:
yat spaSa han.Jasante rastam rasma katarascit.
Or OP.:
pasava hami^fiya hangmata paraita hamaranam cartane.
The law gayamca ajyatimca, that all life must die, and the dwelling
places for the dead, paradise and hell—called “huvitica initi” at the end
of the same gatha—are predetermined at the beginning of the “ahu, i.e.
the human world.” When the fight of history is over, the frasam, apa
tiyarakih begins, the zrvan akarana, eternity after the end of time.



YAMA 313
Y.30,5:
aya manyuva varta ya drugva acista vrzyo
rtam manyus spanisto ya xrozdistan asano vaste
yeca ^snosan ahuram hadyais syo^nais fravrt mazdam
“Of these two manyu, the drugva (manyus) chose to work the wholly
had, but (to work) the rtam the spanisto manyus, who is clothed in
the most-solid heavens, and all who, by conduct as it should be (a Set),
are voluntarily obedient to AhuraMazdah.’’
Gathas and OP. inscriptions use this type of inversion. In these verses
the two principles make themselves the moving forces of the world’s
history. The realm of the one is heaven, of the other hell. The verses
do not speak of creation, but of history.
Creation, cosmology is the subject of the “Gatha of the Vision,” 43,
and of the “Gatha of the Questions,” 44. In 43, Zoroaster says, speaking
as a poet, not a theologian, st.5
:
spantam at dwa mazda manhi ahura
hyat ^wa ahos zan^oi darsam prviyam
hyat da syodna mizdavan yaca u^Sa
akam akai vahviyam rtim vahve
^wa hunara damois rvese apame
“As the holy one I knew Thee, A.M., when I beheld Thee at the pro
creation of life, as the primordial one, when Thou ordainedst the works
and the words to be bearing return, the bad lot for the bad (deeds)
and the good for the good, through Thy handy-work, at the last turning
of the creation!”
The birth of life is not the law of dying, and paradise and hell for
good and bad ones is merely the execution of the law of reward given
by the god at the creation. There is no contradiction.
hunara, to Vhu-, whence “huti, handicraft,” is the handy-work,
^Tquiovpyia, AhuraMazdah is the demiurge of the world. Hertel is
mistaken in relating the last words to the last act of the creation “bei
der letzten Wendung der Spendung,” instead of the end of the world.
The sentence “as the holy one, spanta, I knew T/iee, when he circum
ambulated me as Vahumano,” many times repeated in this gatha, makes
it perfectly certain that AhuraMazdah himself is the Spanta who ap



YAMA
314
pears in the aspect of Vahumano. In Y.30,5, the manyus spanista is
clothed in the most-solid heavens, asano vaste, as is Mazdah in Y/.i3,3,
vaste vahanam, and “those who are obedient to Mazdah have chosen
like Spanto manyuY’ = Mazdah. In 43,6, he appears as spanto manyus
and as Vahumano and in all his aspects simultaneously at the last
judgment."
Bartholomae wrote in W^.1621: “Dass Geldner u.a. sich . . . wieder
dazu verstehen konnten, spanta von KSl. svetu loszureissen, ist mir
nicht begreiflich, . . . ohne die Pii. awzunik wiirde niemand auf den
Gedanken kommen, spanta anders als mit ‘heilig’ widerzugeben.”
Lommel translates, almost thirty years later, “klug” und “der kliigere’’;
Nyberg “wirksam.” Hertel objected to “heilig” and contributed an
interesting treatise on the origin of the German word, starting from
Wulfila’s Bible translation. H. W. Bailey established the etymology of
the Iranian words derived from Vsu- and their Slavic correspondents
and other IE. words. Markwart said “heilig,” especially insisting on the
fact that “Nutzen” (profit) does not belong to Zoroaster’s sphere of
thought, and contributing the explanation of Skol. e^ap.7raTot = tpat
oSot, afsand = spanta. After all these investigations, one must go back
to “holy.” Starting from different notions, the semantic development of
Ir. spanta, Lat. sanctus, “holy” and “heilig,” has taken such a turn, that
the notions coincide to a large extent. It is a delusion to believe that
greater accuracy can be reached at all in worlds of ideas so far removed
in space and time.
Thus, spanta manyus is the Spiritus Sanctus, the Holy Ghost. On
the other hand, akam mano—equally clear in other gathas—is Ahra
manyus. But nowhere is there a trace of a corresponding organization
of evil in aspects of Ahramanyus, as e.g. aka manah, esma, drug etc.
Vahumano, well translated in Greek by evvoia or ewopta, is Good
Will, as Markwart emphasizes, Gath.uk. 62, “keine Eigenschaft des
Intellekts (Sinn), sondern des Widens.” It is sometimes “conscience,”
always contrasted to “malevolence,” an opposition meaning much more
than that of truth and lie. Vahumano is the force by which Spanta
manyus effects Rtam in the “ahu, human life.” This notion of Good
Will foreshadows already the Christian “Love.”

YAMA
If in Y.30,4 the two principles Good and Evil establish first of all
life and death, and reward in heaven and hell at the end of the ahu,
if in Y.30,5 they are the moving forces of history, and if in 43,5 the
primordial AhuraMazdah “procreates life” and “ordains the works to
bring return,” then the two primordial spirits, manyu prvya of 45,2,
compared in 30,3 with the “twins sleep,” are none but AhuraMazdah
(in his quality as Spantamanyus) and AhramanyuL
But here again no word says that AhuraMazdah and Ahramanyus
were twins, descendants from the same parents. The verses contaiu not
the slightest indication of Zurvanism. That is a doctrine attested first
by Eudemus of Rhodus, Aristotle’s pupil, who is quoted by Damascius,
de prim.princ. 125 (ed. Kopp, 384): “The magi and the whole nation
of the Aryans call—the ones ‘topos, space,’ the others ‘chronos, time’

the homogeneous primordial being from which either a good god or an
evil demon, or light and darkness, dissociated themselves.”
Nyberg, 122, translates Y.30,3; “Jene beiden Ur-manyu, die
Zwillinge Schlaf (und sein Bruder) waren, wie iiberliefert war
den ist, das Bessere und das Schlechte,” and infers from this
translation: “Die ’V’orstellungen von den Zwillingen bilden also
einen Bestandteil einer traditionellen Theologie, die es vor Zoro
aster in der Gatha-Gemeinde gab. Die beiden manyu sind zwar
von Anfang an Gegensatze, aber sie sind es nur in Gedanken,
Worten und Thaten; mehr wird nicht gesagt.” Nobody could
say more than all. “Die Aufteilung in Gut und Bose beruht auf
Wahl, nicht auf Erschaffung. Sogar die manyu (sind so) durch
Wahl, nicht aus innerer Notwendigkeit,” which remiads one
of squabbles of Byzantine, Sunnite and Protestant sects, typical
for religiously unproductive periods. “Die Gatha-Gemeinde [all
in spaced print] hat eine gegensatzliche Perspektive ethischen
Inhalts auf einem monistischen Hintergrund.” This “traditional
theology in the Gatha-community before Zoroaster” also “theol
ogy of the pre-Zoroastrian community,” presupposes gathas be
fore the gathas, and is the foundation of the “theology of the
Gatha-community.” The gathas are “carmina, odes,” and all this
results from the wrong translation of “ya asruvatam” by “as
has been transmitted,” instead of “that are praised in song.”



YAMA
316
A conception different from Y.30 seems first to appear in the very
late, identical passages of y/.ii,i2 and Y.57,17, where Sroso is described
like Argos in Hesiod’s hymn
:
yo noit pasceta hushvafa who no more slept
yat manyu daman daSitam since the two spirits created the world,
yasca spanto yasca ahro the Holy and the Bad one.
This is late enough to be Zurvanism. A few lines after, the data videva,
Videvdad is mentioned: the preceding lines, too, must be dated in the
time of the Videvdad, the Arsacid period. In Zoroaster’s concept, the
bad spirit is no creator, he merely “works the evil” in the existing crea
tion. It is only 1,500 years later that e.g. al-Khwarizmi says : “ahraman
khaliq al-sharr, Ahriman is the creator of Evil.”
The Sasanian theologians were the first to advance the doubly false
interpretation that the “two principles” were themselves the “twins,”
and that Zrvan, Time, was their father. Without seeing the first error,
which makes every discussion useless, Nyberg declaims against the sec
ond, 104: “In den Gathas ist AhuraMazdah unzweifelhaft der hochste
Gott; eine Vorstellung, nach der er ein abgeleiteter Gott ware, wiirde
der gesamten gathischen Religion zuwider laufen. AhuraMazdah, der
Vater der Zwillinge, ist eine dem Zurvan des Westens parallele
Erscheinung im Osten. Hieraus folgt ein sehr wichtiger Schluss: Ahura
Mazdah steht jenseit von Gut und Bose. [Nietzsche: jedenfalls nicht
jenseit von gut und schlecht!] Er hat die Schdpfer dieser Gegensatze
hervorgebracht, aber nicht sie selbst. . . . Es kann keinem Zweifel unter
liegen, dass in der Theologie der vorzarathustrischen Gemeinde Ahura
Mazdah wesentlich [essentially] ein deus otiosus war.”
Whether “derived in the west” or “parallel in the east,” in no case
is he the “father of the twins” with one of whom he is compared.
Neither is he the “creator of the creator of evil.” In Y.44,3, Zoroaster
asks “Who is the procreator of Rtam ?” but does not go on “Who is the
procreator of Ako manyus V’ These verses do not describe an “unessen
tial” interruption of the “otium,” Y.44:

: Who is the procreator of Rtam, the primordial father ?
Who has created the sun and the course of the stars ?
Who is it through whom the moon waxes and wanes ?
4: Who supports the earth below and the heaven,
that it do not fall ? who the waters and plants ?
Who harnesses to wind and clouds their racers ?
Who, Mazdah, is the creator of Vahumano?
5
: Which master created light and darkness ?
Which master created sleep and wakefulness ?
Who dawn, midday, and night?
the reminders of his task to the thoughtful ?
The verses are like Ps. 33,6-7; “By the word of the Lord were the
heavens made. He gathereth the waters of the sea as in a skin, [he
layeth up the depth in store houses].” Or Ps. 19,1; “The heavens declare
the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth his handy-work.” St.4
transfers the cosmologic activity of the Fravarti, Yz.13,2-16, to Ahura
Mazdah : the continuous movement of the Universe, without a minute
of “otium.”
From these verses Nyberg quotes only the line “Who created light
and darkness, sleep and wakefulness?” in the erroneous belief that
these were the “Sleep and its brother,” and says : “Die Antwort ist ohne
Zweifel AhuraMazdah.” This is aimed against Zurvan of the Sasanian
theologians, for, sharing their assumption that twins must have a
father, and doubly mistaken in the belief that sleep and wakefulness
were sleep and its brother and these good and evil, he wants to lay
them at AhuraMazdah’s door.
hvafno can no more be a son of AhuraMazdah than hypnos, the
master of all gods, a son of Zeus. As “primordial,” the twins are a rare



YAMA
318
case of “lam yulid.” A recherche de la maternite would probably find
clues leading to “nakta, nyx, night”; but neither Zurvan nor Ahura
Mazdah was their father; they are “prvya,” with no father at all:
dinanzi a me non fur cose create!
What we know about the twins is: they belong to an immemorially
old myth, bear the dual-name “the two sleeps,” and Zoroaster says: “You
have twins, so do I!” He uses the pair as a metaphor for his two prin
ciples. From the mistaken premise Nyberg draws the “justified conclu
sion”: “Der Schlaf repraesentiert das Licht [=Tagesgott]. . . . Nicht
die physiologische Erscheinung die w'ir Schlaf nennen ist gemeint, son
dern—well Schlafen und Wachen letztlich in uralten kultischen Ver
haltnissen [what about animals?] begriindet sind, und well der Kult
des Tagesgottes mit Trance und hypnotischer Betaubung verbunden
war—darum heisst der manyu des Tagesgottes xvafna ‘Trance.’ ” There
is still: “Der Umstand dass ‘Schlaf’ als Name des wirksamen [= spanta]
manyu auftritt— 122: Spanta manyu tragt den Namen xvafna ‘Trance’

zeigt, dass der trance-Zustand des Schamanen gemeint ist, in dem
sein Geist sich auf dem Fluge befindet. . . .” This sounds like a solution
of one of the darkest sayings of Heraclitus: ot KadevSovTe<; ipyarai
Kol crvvepyol rdiv iv twl Kocrpuoi yivop,ivQ)v.
Raving madness, ecstasies, frenzy and the epileptic conditions, ex
haustions, stupor, trance connected with them, have been expertly
described by lamblichus, “On Mysteries” and Cicero “On Divination.”
The Gr.Bdh., too, speaks of trance, in the chapter on opposites, F. 47f.,
where the words are arranged under two columns, evil and good. Under
“evil” it gives “trance, busasp < busyansta,” under “good” it gives “sleep,
Xvap < hvafna.” Busyansta, with the epithet “zarina, making decrepit,”
is a specially pernicious female demon; in frgm. Westerg. 10, she calls
“hvafsata martiyakaho, hvafsata mrzu.jiyaho, hvafsata mrzu.jitayo, go
asleep mortals, go asleep short-living ones, go asleep short-lived ones!”
Bartholomae, KZ.29,547, explained busyansta as “condition of him who
will become, i.e. will come to,” euphemistically for unconscious trance,
which was believed to be a temporary death. So, what Nyberg describes
as the “Holy Ghost,” is in Iranian belief the work of the most-unholy
ghost.



YAMA 319
Zoroaster quotes a name from an antique myth, well known to his
hearers, but not mentioned in the yashts. This name is a dual of hvafna,
hypnos, somnus. He compares this pair with his Good and Evil, the
powers which determine first of all that all life must die, gayamca
ajyatimca. These words, hence, contain the tertium comparationis,
which is neither trance nor wakefulness, but death.
Homer, 11. xiv,23i, calls hypnos-hvafna KacrLyvT]To<; Oavaroio ava^
TTavTOiv re dewv irdvroiv t dvdpcoTrav. Hesiod and Herakleitos, too, phi
losophize on the brothers Hypnos and Thanatos. More than “partir”
the sleep is “mourir un peu,” and death is the sleep from which no one
awakes. Sleep generates new life, is the good death, belonging to light.
Death is wholly darkness. Nyberg 231; “Fiir den asa-glaubigen Ekstati
ker ist schon jetzt der Tod eine bedeutungslose Episode, und er wird
es in noch hdherem Masse in der verklarten Welt sein, wo alle Schran
ken des gottlichen Ewigkeitslebens gefallen sind” [sic].
This gallimathias can indeed “auch den abgehartetsten sprachlos
machen” (482).

The thought of the twins, sleep and death, pervades all myths,
legends and fairy tales of lE.-speaking peoples, and the myth to which
Zoroaster alludes was certainly one of the primeval period. The whole
conception derived from this verse, namely of a Gatha-community
with traditional theology and contrary perspective of ethical contents
on monistic background, of a deus otiosus, A.M., who, beyond good
and evil, restricts himself in his otium cum indignitate to create the
“effective spirit,” called “sleep, trance” for working only with senses
fuddled, and the bad spirit, bad without inner necessity, and who then
leaves his creation—Zola; “jamais on n’abandonne une oeuvre!”—to
these creatures, altogether a ghastly picture, and moreover the “much
more highly insignificant episode of death in the limited life of eternity
(or life in limited eternity?),” the whole Gatha-community, a kind of
theological seminary, in the steppes of the Turyan tribe of Friyana,
“stiirzt rettungslos zusammen,” as a construction “die so unsinnig ist
wie nur etwas sein kann” (357).



XXII. YAMA X§ETA
“'Ofirjpos a^tos ck tQv aywvwv iK^dWetrSai
icot pavi^effdaC*—Heraclitus
Y.32 is Zoroaster’s song against the deva and devayasna, the gods and
heroes of a “heroogonia” or of an epopee, of which small fragments
are preserved in the Awesta : Ardvisura, Yt.g, Druvaspa, 13, Fravarti,
14, Vrthragna, 15, Vayu, 17, Rti, and 19 Zam-Armatis. Among them,
Yt.1T, stands by itself, while 5, 15, 17 and 19 conform wholly as to the
three oldest cycles of Yama, Krsaspa, and the Kavi; of the fourth cycle,
of Vistaspa, parts have been subsequently introduced, with variants, in
Y/.5 (with more detail) and in 15, 17 and 19 (quite short).
The Median history of Herodotus, in which myth and truth are
mixed, and a few legends told by Ctesias as if they were history, show
how widely the old myth, including the kavi cycle, was spread among
the people during the fifth century b.c. Xenophon’s words, Cyrop.i;i,
6 Kiipo? Xeyerai koX ^Serat eri Kai vvv vtto tcov fiap^dpiov, attest the
Husravah legend at the end of the 5th century, and, in the middle of
the fourth, Dinon apud Cicero quotes from it the tale of Cyrus’ dream.
Chares of Mytilene tells, at the end of the fourth century, the most
explicit version of the legend of Vistaspa and ZarivariL Some of Ctesias’
tales show also how soon historical events of a near past were absorbed
by the legend ; the “mythic thinking” of the people worked quickly and
constantly, using the old patterns over and over again.
There was no reason to have the fragments arranged in the yashts
in any specific order. If Yt. 5, 9, 15, 17 and 19 have them in an identical
sequence, this is because the tales had been subjected to a uniform
redaction. If Y^.i3 deviates in some points, it is because something
belonging to the phase before that redaction has been preserved.
The feature most conspicuous to us, of that redaction, is the chrono
logical arrangement of the stories, which is fitted into the old system of
nine aeons. We can observe it best because it was maintained through
out the Arsacid period, which was especially fertile in transformations
and alterations, and it survived unaltered in the Sasanian xvataynama\
and Firdausi s Shahnamah. The redaction therefore consisted in col
lecting formerly isolated tales and welding them together into a great
epopee. The fragments preserved in the Awesta are quotations from this



YAMA XSETA 321
epopee, the uniform redaction of which, hence, is older than the redac
tion of the yashts themselves, and must have taken place during an
early phase of the Achaemenian period. We shall see that it was done
after the time of the gathas. The younger legend of the Vistaspa cycle
originated at that time, and, to be quoted in the yashts, must first have
been added to the epopee. But the variants show that it was not sub
jected to so strict a redaction as the older parts. Before the time of
Alexander it was admitted into the Awesta redaction made under the
reign of Artaxerxes II. Thus the development of the epopee and of
the Awesta took place in parallel to each other, and both unite mate
rials that had existed for a long time. But the epic materials were
the first to be collected: the “proto-Shahnamah” is older than the
Awesta.
For the introductory stanzas 1-2 of Y.32 see under ‘Armatis.’ St.3-7
speak in general of the gods and heroes. St.3:
at yus deva vispaho akat manaho sta ci0ram
yasca va mas yazate drujasca parimatoisca
syomam api dbitana yais asrozdvam bumya hafta^e
“You, the gods all and who worship you, arc the brood of the evil
Spirit, the Druxs and Pride, and the deeds are double-sided for which
you are praised in song on this seventh of the earth!”
The “seventh of the earth” is the middle krsvar,—see under ‘Krsvar’
—and the words say that the epics were sung over the whole of aryanam
Xsa^ram. Cf. Vid.2.,20: “Yamo sruto aryane vejahe, Jamsed,
praised in song in Eranvej.” “Pride,” parimatis, Gr. hybris, is the
typical vice of the Iranian nobility, see under ‘Armatis.’ “dbitana,
double- (sided, -faced)” is defined by the following stanza, st.4:
yat yus.ta framimi^a ya martiya acista danto
"^vasyante^ devazuka vahos sizdyamna manaho
mazda ahurahya X^atos nasyanto rtatca
“For you tell fables of wholly evil deeds so that men doing them are
^Text: vaxsante, Bartholomae: subj. of Vvak-; Duchesne: "'’vaxsantai, to Vvaxs- “ils deviennent.” The verb must be V vak-, beside framimi^a, asrozdvam etc, and rather 'vasyante than vaxsjante.



322 YAMA XSETA
called ‘beloved-by-the-gods,’ while they are a horror to Vahumano and
sinners against AhuraMazdah’s will!”
“yat, ex quo,” only here, cannot be temporal “since” (JV^.),
but only causal, or perhaps, referring to sravah (to be abstracted from
asrozdvam) “in which songs,” the causative connection of the stanza
being already expressed by “ta—ya.” This would give the meaning “For
in your epics you invent tales of such a kind that ” For devazuka, i.e.
ovTiv av 0ed?, see under ‘Deva.’ St.5
:
ta dabnota martiyam hujiyatois amrtatasca
hyat va aka manaha yan devan akasca manyus
aka syo^nam vacaha ya fracinas drugvantam x^ayo
“Thereby you cheated man out of his good-living and immortality etc.”
Instead of “thereby” perhaps better—like “yat” in st.4—“in those
(epics).” With these words the prophet alludes for the first time to
the Yama myth: hujyati describes the paradisiac life of the golden age,
when men were still immortal. The rest, with “the evil Spirit contrives
a drugvant to be ruling,” seems to allude to AziDahaka, who succeeded
Yama, and at the same time to establish an analogy between AziDahaka
and G5mata (or Cambyses?). St.6:
poru ena an.axsta yais sravahyati yazi tais a^a
hata.marane ahura vahika voista manaha
“Their many acts of violence and discord, for which epics are sung.
Thou, Lord remembering-men’s-merits, knowest as VahuMano!”
sravahyati, as denom.pres. of ‘sravanha, vrddhi deriv. of “sravah,
fame,” must be an expression more intense than the simple y^sru-, “to
praise in song,” viz. “to sing epics.” “hata.marani, meriti-memor,”
resembles sahvar.marika in Y.29,4. The Pahl. commentary to both
words is the same: “he keeps account of sin and good deeds.”
St.7: (text under ‘Last Judgment’): “The testimony of the ordeal
will reveal their true rixta, the value of what they leave behind, well
known to Ahura.”
The whole tenor of these verses is of the same spirit as Herakleitos’
ov T€ jLvuxxKOJv 6 eov<; ov8 ijpajas oiTivi's eicn.
V
sru-, sravah, Gr. KXe/ro5, OHG. hliu, is by etymology and sense the
word for the singing and reciting—NP. surudan—of the epics. It
appears in this gatha more frequently than anywhere else, clearly



YAMA XSETA 323
indicating its purport: the gatha is a declamation against the “heroes,
helden lobebaeren” (=Ir. ‘sravahvant) of the “Proto-Shahnamah.”
‘sravanha is apparently the word for the epopee itself. Not to have
grasped the meaning of V sru- is the reason all translations went astray.^
In st.8, Zoroaster chooses, for explaining his transvaluation of moral
values, the individual case—to which he had already alluded in st.5:
esam enaham vivahuso sravi yamascit
“among these villains, Yamo Vivahuso of all is praised!”
Christ explains his doctrine in the Gospel of Matthew by saying:
“Have you not read in the law . . . but I say unto you. . . .” Zoroaster’s
way is the same, only his audience is different, and therefore, instead
of the Law and the Prophets, it is the epic from which he takes his
example. If a very short quotation in a verse of Zoroaster was enough
to remind his hearers of a myth, that shows that the epic not only
existed, but was known by heart by almost every man. Like the quota
tions in Y^.I3, Zoroaster’s allusions do not conform with the uniform
redaction of the epic reflected by the great yashts; they represent a
phase older than the early Achaemenian redaction, and that phase

of separate epics—is older than the gathas.
The figure of Vivahvant-Vivasvant is common to Iranian and Indian
myth, hence at least of Aryan antiquity. From the Veda we can infer
that Vivasvant was, in the Aryan myth, a god of light, father of Usa-Eos
and of her brothers, the Asvin twins. In Iran, his son is Yama, i.e.
the twin; of the father—beside the patronym of the son—nothing is
left but a short remark in Hom-yasht y.9,4, that he was the first to
press Homa, and therefore was rewarded by having a son like Yama
Xseta.
Bartholomae, W^.14^2, qualifies as “mir hdchst zweifelhaft” the usual
“ V sru-, MP. srod, “song,” NP. surudan “to sing,” means MHG. singen und sagen. The translations, W^, gives of sravi in y.32,7 and 8; 33,7; 45»io; 53,1; of srotu in y.49,9; of frasruta in y.50,8, are all wrong, y.50,8: padais ya frasruta Iza>a, means “verses sung con passione”: the denom. srava\a in ho no vasti carkr^ra sra\ayahe, means “he wants to sing our fame”; cna yais sravahyati “the misdeeds for which epics are sung to him,” not “by which he has succeeded [a wrong etymology of an.axsta, i.e. “unpeaceable”] to get in ill-repute” Cf. Ass. wa.me.li.ar.su, king of Medes, presupposing an analogous \erb. denom. \ahma}at(part.) from vahma “praise, pra\er.” y.46,14: ko va frasrudyai vasti, “who wants to be praised”; y.46,34: “frasrudyai r^vvo, who is worth to be praised.'” Vid.2,20: “yamo x^cto sruto aryanc vcjahe, Jamsid, praised in song in Eranvcz,” etc.



324 YAMA XSETA
combination of vivahvant and OL vyucchati, VS'ah-. This root, also
with vi-, appears in Iranian only as inch. pres. ‘ usa, and only for the
“flashing up” of UH. Zoroaster uses a neologism, vivahusa, for the tradi
tional vivahvana, OP. vivana (see under ‘Vehviya ), and for the vulgar
language, the word seems to have been merely a name no longer con
veying any meaning. His epithet xseta Yama shares with the sun, hvar, and with Apam
Napat. The fern, xsoi^nl is the epithet of UB and Rtis. H. Collitz, in
Orient.Stud.Pavry, compared Yama xseta with the Nordic Baldur, i.e.
king, prince, and with saturnus, old saeturnus, this to *satus < 'saetus as
taciturnus to tacitus, and *saetus equal to Ved. ksetah “ruler” in RV.
9,97,3; ksetavant in RV.6p.,\. Aw. xseta survives in Soghd. ixseS, NP.
se8, with Arab, imala saS. It may have been by the influence of the epic
that this title, like kay < kavi, never quite disappeared though its sense
was lost.
In y^.i3 and Vid.-2-^, Yama is the first man and king, ruler of the
primeval golden age. The fact that Zoroaster chose just him as example
proves that to him, too, Yama was still the first, whereas in the uniform
redaction of the great yashts the strangers Hosyanha and taxmo Rupis
precede him. In the original myth, the whole earth was Yama’s king
dom, but this earth was limited by the horizon of Eranvez, the old
home of the Aryans, it was not yet Eransahr. There, men lived in eternal
spring, eternal youth and immortal.
A
first man and king of the old myth is something quite different
from the incorporeal, theological figure of the first man “Urmensch,”
gayamart, which was created in connection with eschatologic specula
tions. The “Urmensch” is more than once subject of Nyberg’s discus
sions, e.g. 388: “Unser Awesta giebt . . . keine Vorstellung davon,
welch zentrale Gestalt der Urmensch im iranischen Glauben war”;
84: “Eine Urmenschgestalt wird im Mithrayasht nicht sichtbar . . .”;
300: “Die Urmenschgestalten diirften in der Gatha-Gemeinde nicht
stark entwickelt gewesen sein; dort interessierte man sich mehr fiir den
Urstier und die Urkuh”; 96: “Die Grosskonige haben keinen Anlass
gefunden, Zarathustra besondere Aufmerksamkeit zu schenken. . . .
Es besteht aller Grund zu glauben, [the quoted passages cannot be that
reason] dass sie interessiert zuhorten, wenn Magier ihnen vom Urmen



YAMA XSETA 325
schen erzahlten.” He says himself “what they thought in their inner
most, we do not know,” but an analogy might help : Kit. al-Aghdni, 6,8
:
“ ‘Ubaida b. Hilal used to call, when people gathered round him: Some
of you come forth ! Thus, two young fellows of the army stepped forth
and he asked: What do you like better, something from the Qur’an
or poems? They said: The Qur'an, wallah, we know as well as you,
recite us poems! ‘U.: You rascals, now I know, you prefer poems to the
Qur’an 1 And then he treated them with poems till they were full. They
did not part sooner.” Likewise, Darius may have said to the magi:
“Zoroaster—I know him better than you rascals, tell me something of
the first man!” But, from talks I had at Takht i Djamshid, on “Yama’s
throne,” with successors of Yama and Darius about their predecessors,
I got the impression that the first-man was Hecuba to them.
The text of Y.32,8 is:
esam enaham vivahuso sravi yamascit
yo martiyan cixsnuso^ ahmakan gaus baga hvaramno
esam *cita ahmi ^wahmi mazda vici^oi api
“Of these villains Yama Vivahusa of all is praised, who hearkened to
the mortals (still) immortal, by eating beef. From them, at the revenge,
I want to be separated by Thee!”
The second line, a fragment of the myth itself, will be discussed later.
Bartholomae translated the beginning: “Zu diesen Frevlern gehort
wie bekannt, auch Yima der Sohn des Vivahvant.” The Aghani tell a
nice anecdote of abu l-‘Atahiya, where he says: “All men make verses,
they just are not aware of it!” Andreas: “Als einer dieser Frevler wurde
zumal bekannt, Yama der Sohn des Vivahvant.” Nyberg: “Als solcher
Siinden schuldig ist Vivahvant’s Sohn genannt worden.”
In the last translation, “guilty of such sin” brings in a new thread of
thought, whilst Zoroaster declaims already in five full stanzas against
the same villains. Andreas’ “zumal” is right: it puts an accent on the
greatest hero as greatest “enah, vjSpt^oi'ra.”* But in the epic Yama
was exalted, sravahyati, not as criminal, but as the first of heroes,
radiant, with eyes like the sun, who surpassed the gods, and the poets,
^ Tedesco: “perhaps better verb.finit. ‘cixSnusat/’ Ct. drha.enah in ^-34, 4 “causing severe pain,” NP. durust < MP. drust, OP '"diu'’ti. n,)t {\Vb.) “sichtbare Gewaltthat ausubend/’



326 YAMA XSETA
with human understanding, felt only sympathy when he finally sinned
and lost immortality. If this “Urmenschgestalt der Mithra-Gemeinde”
had been generally rated—“wie bekannt”—as criminal, or had been
enumerated—“genannt”—among a list of such, there was no need for
Zoroaster to get excited. Just the contrary is the case, and his words
purport: “You glorify Yama, and yet your greatest hero is the greatest
villain.”
In 32,c one used to read “esam.cit Y’; the emendation “eHm
cita” is Andreas’. Justi translated “in deiner Entscheidung,
vici^oi, bin ich,” meaning “es steht bei Dir, in Thy discretion.”
H. Collitz, l.c. 91, “hieriiber will ich Dir die Entscheidung an
heimstellen,” with api as postpos. to vici^oi. “vici^oi ahmi” is
not “anheimstellen,” the prophet would not dare but to “leave
everything to his god’s discretion.” Bartholomae, Wb.‘. “ab his
sum in tua separatione postea,” improved by Benveniste, Inf.av.
33, who compares Lat. “essere in odio,” hence “(loin) d’eux je
suis desormais dans ta separation,” i.e. “je serai . .
. par toi separe
d’eux.” It is imprecative: “I want to be separated by Thee.”
Andreas: “bei deren Bestrafung (cita—rtcrt?) bin ich alsdann
unter Deinen Auserwahlten”; vicitoi to Vci- “auserwahlt” is
wrong. The same thought is expressed in Mir.Man. 11,24 by “and
do not count us together with the visobagan, rebels.” The sen
tence means : “When the revenge of the last judgment overtakes
the sinners, do not let me suffer with them!”
Abandoning the special example, Zoroaster continues in st.9: “dul
sastis srava mrndat, telling of ill (-fame) spoils fame!”
duLsasti, Wb. “iible Lehre, evil doctrine.” There is nothing
doctrinal e.g. in ^ati d^ayavaus xsaya^ya. sasti, to v^sanh, OP.
Ozh.-, is simply “pronunciatio, proclamatio,” usually a solemn
speaking, but even that not always. Y.62.7: to all those for
whom he has cooked dinner and breakfast, Atar—the Fire

addresses the “sasti, call,” viz. “Come and get it!” The similar
word duLsravah, Suo-Kke/njs, means “ill-famed”; and Gr.Bdh.
47f., chapter on opposites, says: “deceit and lies, antonyms of
rastih-sravbih, saying-truth.” But in Zoroaster’s idiom “dus-”
is syn. of “mi^ah, wrong,” and has a moral quality; dus.sasti



YAMA XSETA 327
is close to “mi^a.vacah, saying the wrong thing.” Y.45,1 : “noit
dbitiyam dus.sastis ahum mrndat, not shall, a second time,
(= never again) saying-things-immoral corrupt the human
world!” The evil (dus-), the telling of which destroys fame
(srava), is “duLsravah, shame.” One may consider whether
srava means here straightway “the epopee.” At any rate, kXI/to?
is “epic fame,” and the sentence says : “The Iranian epics glorify
what is shame, tell ignominies!”
This criticism of the deal koI '^pcD€<s otrivi'; etcrt is revolutionary and
would hurt still today. The whole gatha makes manifest how unpopular
Zoroaster’s ideas were, just as unpopular as Heraclitus’ “Homer deserves
a thrashing!” And he knew it, for st.9 ends with the words:
ta uxSa manyos mahya mazda rtaica yusmabya grze,
“these words are of my thinking, I lament them for you, Mazdah
and Rtam!”
In st.5, the words dabnota martiyam hujiyatois amrtatasca allude to
the Yama myth, by describing life in the golden age. The very verses
of the epics are preserved in quotations in Y?. 19,32 and 5,26. The first
place has the introductory formula in the 3rd pers.: “yo uzbarat haca
devebyo,” the second in the ist pers.: “ya^a azam uzbarani haca deve
byo.” The verses on the races of Husravah, Yt.ig^yy and 5,50, show the
same difference, which is a clear evidence of ‘quotation’ from the epic,
and it is not permissible to restore the meter, because it was of necessity
wrong in the yasht. In the epic the beginning may have been: “Yamo
vivahvato pu^ro uzbarat haca devebyo.” Y/.i9,32:
uwe ikisca sokaca uwe fsonica van^waca
uWe ^ranfsca frasastica uwe hvar^e ajiyamne
amarsanta pasu.vira ^ahosamne® apaurvare
There are three dvandva connected with ca—ca, and three with
epithets in form of participles. The first three are: riches and prosperity,
cattle-breeding and herds, satiation and “proclamation.” All—except
the last—have an archaic air, and, not necessarily so, but the symmetry
of the composition makes the authenticity of frasasti probable. This
® Text: ahaosDmns, perhaps '•'a-husyamne.



328 YAMA XSETA
would be possible, if the word meant a kind of professional licence, as
in the “Song of the Caravan,” yr.16,2-3, see under ‘Post and Travels.’
The three duals with participles are; “the two foods, i.e. eating and
drinking, never decreasing,” never becoming scanty; “cattle and men
not dying”; “water and plants, i.e. the fields, never dry.” Altogether
this is “hujiyati, good-living,” or “vispa.hu|yati” (see under ‘Harvatat’),
and in all this Yama “uzbarat haca devebyo, surpasses the gods.”
Lommel translates these words “brachte er von den Teufeln
wegnach oben”; Hertel, Siegesf. 43: “welcher den deva raubte,
word, von den deva heraufbrachte ; die Heimat der deva liegt
unter dem Erdboden.” hujyati, one of the things the beggar
wishes his benefactor—see under ‘Poetry’—was never in hell.
Not even this absurd conclusion could induce the translators to
doubt the supposition, the equation “deva = devil.” deva is divi,
the divine ones.
uz.barati is a clear expression: uz—^haca means “up from the
point where the measuring starts,” “higher than” in direction
or degree, syn. of pari and upari; OIr. uz—haca is MP. ac

apar, NP. az—bar. Purs. “yo upari hunaram mano barat,
lit. who carries his will beyond his skill”—i.e. attempts a thing
beyond his capacity, overrates himself; Pahl. transl. “ke . . . apar
ac hunar menisn baret, expl. xvestan pat.an hunar menet ke.s
nest, who fancies himself to be so skillful as he is not.” upari
barati is imepcfiepeiv; uz.barati haca, in 19,32, is Lat. ejfferre,
excellere: “he surpasses the gods in wealth etc.”
The verses describe Yama before his fall, Yr.19,33: “para an.adruxtoit,
before his not-temptation,” with the inimitable negation “before he
wasn’t tempted.” Hertel, Siegesf. 43,9: “vor der Aufhebung der nicht
Vernichtung!” The following words explain it: “para ahmat yat him
ayam drogam vacam aha^yam cinmane pati.barata, before he admitted
droga, the voice that-speaks-forbidden-things in his appetites,” and
19,34: “Then, after having admitted the voice etc., the hvarnah parted
from him.”
ha^ya is Gr. a Set, “as it should be”; the anton. a.ha^ya is “for
bidden.” Thus opposed, the words correspond to Arab, halal
and haram, and “a.ha^ya” means “taboo.” Wolff-Bartholomae:



329
YAMA XSETA
“Aber als er anfing, sich in Gedanken mit ihm, dem liig
nerischen, unwahren Wort zu beschaftigen.” “droga” is not
“mendacious” and “vac” is “voice,” not “word”; “sich beschaf
tigen,” even if “be preoccupied with,” misses the point.—Of the
following words, aveno hvarno fraisto yimo, Benveniste says
“defie I’analyse.” I take “aveno hvarno,” whatever fraisto means,
as part.abs. “with the hvarnah no longer visible.” Lommel goes
on translating “wurde er wegen seiner iiblen Gesinnung
gestiirzt und verbarg sich iiberall auf der Erde.” After having
brought up from hell—Lommel’s translation—all good things
of life, Yama would suffer the blackest ingratitude for his pain
by such a revolution in paradise.
Y/. 19,34 under ‘Homa’) says only:
brasat—yamo asato Yama roams about peaceless
(= outlawed)

dausmanahyaica ho strto prostrate in misery
ni8arat—upari zam he hides—over the earth.
The verses are deranged by interpolations, but could be restored by
inserting xs^to, as opp. to asato, and changing the sequence of the
words, dausmanahya is Ved. daurmanasya, formed like haumanahya.®
In Y.32,8b, the verse we have left to be studied, Zoroaster reveals
what Yr.19 (and 5), the Horn yasht, and pass over in silence:
through whose “voice” the temptator speaks, and what was the “taboo”
:
yo martiyan cixsnuso ahmakan gaus baga hvaramno
Bartholomae: “der um die Menschen zufrieden zu stellen, den un
srigen die Fleischstiicke zu essen gab; nach uralter Sage der Fiirst,
der seine Unterthanen durch Fleischspeise unsterblich gemacht hat.”
“Fleischstiicke” would be an unnecessary “rationing” in a country
where “the two foods were ajyamna, not diminishing” however much
they ate. The food of immortality was vegetarian, see under ‘Harvatat.’
The paraphrase is totally wrong. Since Yama’s time men are mortal, so,
® H'^.1634.—Cf. dausdatahya in O^w.56, Wh.i “wegen Mangel an Einsicht,” Duchesne “par
Ignorance.” It is rather deriv. from “data, fixed date” and means—similar to amanimna—“un
expectedly,” scil. as bad surprise (death comes), Germ, ‘zur Unzeit,’ untimely, opp. to Gr. evxatpws, and equal to Ass. ina um la semtu.



330 YAMA XSETA
a priori, he cannot have made them immortal, but only the contrary,
as Zoroaster says “have cheated man out of his good-living and immor
tality.”
cixsnuso—or here, with Tedesco "^cixsnusat—desid. of
V xsnu- “to hear,” means “hearken, listen to,” with the connota
tion “to something forbidden,” see Y.49,1 : yo dusr^ris cixsnuso
under ‘Bandva.’ The acc. martiyan—ahmakan belongs to this
verb, not to hvaramno, which in no case means “give food to.”
Translating “baga” by “Fleischstucke” means confounding por
tion and ration; it is not the portion the butcher cuts out as
a beefsteak, but the share God allots to men. gaus baga is syn. of
Akk. pitipabagu < OP. 'pi^wabaya, Gr. deriv. rroriySa^i?, a
diet, habit of life, see under ‘Harvatat.’
The only improvement in Andreas’ translation “der den zu uns
gehorigen Menschen zu gefallen suchte, indem er Stiicke vom Rind
ass” is that martiyan ahmakan are objects of cixsnuso. Nyberg’s “der
um den Menschen zu gefallen, die Unsren Stiicke vom Rind zu essen
lehrte” is a step back; teaching to eat pieces could only mean “not the
whole ox.” Andreas had already rejected the causative interpretation
of hvaramna, however near at hand. It is everywhere the task of the
“first one”—-Arab, al-awa’il—to teach all imaginable things, and in
the late legend of Yama, e.g. in ThaalibI, Yama-Djamshid teaches the
fabrication of weapons, saddles, bridles, other tools and implements,
spinning and weaving of silk, linen and cotton, the whole national
economy, quarrying and masoning of stones, making chalk and cement,
architecture, hydraulic wheels and mills, bridge-building, mining, per
fumery, pharmaceutics, medicine, ship-building and pearl-fishery. He
is a university without theological, philological and juridical faculty,
with enough work for the 716V2 years of his rule. But “Stiicke vom
Rind essen” is not among these subjects; on the contrary, according to
the legend even under his successor Dahak men did not yet eat meat.
Under Dahak only, Iblls-Ahriman had the bright idea of offering him
self as chef and giving him the habit of an exclusive meat-diet, in order
to make him bloodthirsty. Iblis starts, to Dahak’s delight, with
partridges—toujours perdrix—goes over to lamb, then to mutton, and
finally to nothing but beef; “the stomach is a cursed Satan!”



YAMA XSETA 33I
The three translations quoted are worse than wrong, ahmakan quali
fies martiyan, the men in Yama’s paradise, who lived 3,000-2,000 years
before Zoroaster. Yama could not “satisfy” his men by giving something
to eat to Zoroaster’s “Unsrigen, ours.” Neither can ahmakan have the
meaning of “*ahmavant, (mortals) like ourselves,” for man lost his
immortality only by Yama’s fall. So says Zoroaster in Y.32,5: dabndta
amrtata, and Y2;.i9,32; amarsanta pasu.vira. There is no problem:
ahmakong is a clerical error for amahrkang, i.e. “amhrkan, immortals”
“Yama who listened to the (still) immortal mortals and ate beef.”
This was the taboo. Gen.'^,iy says: “Thou hast hearkened, ci^snuso,
to the voice, vacam aha^yam, of thy wife, and hast eaten, hvaramno,
of the tree!” In both cases, immortality was bound to the interdiction
of a special food, here beef, there an apple. GfK.1,29 permits the eating
of “every herb bearing seed, to you it shall be for meat!” The yahwistic
version, Gen.i,g and 2,17, permits eating from every tree, “but of the
tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in
the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die!”
The seducer is, in the Biblical story, the serpent, which first seduces
Eve, to whose voice Adam listens. In y/.i9,33, droga is the seducer, and
in Y.32,8 Yama listens to the voice of the martiyan who—seduced by
droga—claim meat. This feature was transformed, in the late legend,
into Iblis as chef of Dahak. There is a story in N?<w.ii,4, where “the
mob fell a lusting, who shall give us flesh to eat and whereas Moses
says “sooner kill me!” Yama gives way to public opinion and trespasses
the taboo. Thereupon, the hvarnah, his “Fortuna” parts from him, and
men, created immortal, lose their immortality, Y.32,5.
In contrast to this mythic concept, Zoroaster makes the law “gayam
ajyatimca” be established at the very beginning.—To consider eating
and dying as complementary is common in the East. Nam.Nip. §80,
says in a letter of condolence: “There is no remedy against death and
dying for the food-eating humanity.” And Sha’ul b. Salman of Hillah,
my manager in Samarra, who had the whole wisdom of Solomon tanu
man^ra, in his body, used to say: “We all die from eating.”
For his sin, Yama is expelled from paradise and hides as an outlaw
without peace. The fact that he was being killed (sawed in two) by Azi
Dahaka could be combined with this motif, though the fragments of



332 YAMA XSETA
text preserved do not show how. But the motif is unreconcilable with
the other one, of which large parts have survived, that the paradisiac
life ended with winter and flood and extinction of two-thirds of all
life. This is announced to Yama with the instruction how to save him
self and the remaining third, Vid.-2,2.2, cf. 2,23 under ‘Ardvi’: avi ahum
astvantam ayam zimojanhantu! Bartholomae (cf. ZAirWb. 98) : “Upon
the evil humanity the winters shall come!” Justi, on the contrary,
“upon humanity the bad winters.” The Pahl. transl. has indeed, like
Justi, “apar o a^v e astowand an e vattar zamistan raset,” and ayavant
is ad], to “winter” in Vid.'],2']. Language and grammar are too inferior
to decide whether the announcement implies “punishment for their
guilt” or not.
Against this winter, Yama builds his “var” in T/V.2,30. AhuraMazdah
prescribes: “make the var one tacara long on all four sides; the fra
tamam dahyaus, front part of the deh, village, make nine, the middle
six, the back part three pr^wo, alleys?”—a text grammatically deficient;
on the first nine pr^wo a thousand men and women shall dwell, on the
second 600, on the third 300. The sum— 1,900—means “infinite.”
In FfJ.2,28, Yama is ordered to bring into this var the biggest and
handsomest of all men and women, of all animals, the highest and
most fragrant of all plants, the best tasting viands: “te krnava mi^ware
ajyamnam a ahmat yat aite naro varofsva ahan.”
Bartholomae regarded this varofsva as a loc.pl. of var, con
fused with the verbal varfsva of st.io, and so arrived at the star
tling translation: “die lass sich paaren ohne Unterlass, solange
Manner in den varsva sind.” But there is only one var, and, of
necessity, the sentence speaks of both sexes and moreover of
humans and animals. The adv. ajyamna is not “incessantly,”
but “not-diminishing”—see under ‘Haugava’—in the sense “that
their number may not decrease,” and “naro varaf sva,” corrupted
as it is, hides probably the dvandva nara-pasu with va—va,
meaning “not to let the number of men and animals become
less than when they entered.”
Excluded from entering the var are people with infirmities and sick
nesses, a list of ten words, related to those excluded from sacrificing in



YAMA XSETA 333
Y/.5,92-93, but composed in such poor language that only a few can be
determined with some certitude.
In the epic of Gilgamesh, the building of the ark is thus described:
“Timber a house, build a boat! Equally long shall be its breadth and
length! From the plan? 120 cubits were Its walls, 120 cubits
the of its roof. I covered? it sixfold, divided it at the outside?
sevenfold, inside? I divided it ninefold.” One cannot fail to see a
connection, perhaps a closer one than the mutilated text allows to see.
The comparison shows also that the measurements are part of the
original story. They are given in archaic “lengths of a race-course,”
"^(ta)carta.dra)ah, Pahl. transl. aspres-drahnad (see under ‘Poetry’). The
length of an old race-course must have been one-ninth of a double
parasang or almost four-fifths of a mile.
St.31: “Thereupon Yama thought: by what means shall I build the
var, as AhuraMazdah has commanded?” and the god says: “Handsome
Yama, anha zmo pasnabyo vispara zastabyo vixaSa (manayan ahe
ya^a nu martiyaka xsivisti zme visavayante),” “stamp the clay with
the heels, knead it with the hands,” Pahl. transl. : “en zamik pasnak be
uspurr u pa dast be afxast (humanakih 6 cigon nun martom susr
zamik be savenend).” The gloss says: “just as, still today, men stamp
liquid and earth,” which is still true at our time. The gloss is old, for
the Pahl. translation takes it as a part of the text and paraphrases
“liquid-earth they make go asunder.” “husk u x^'^b dry and wet” is a
standing idiom, e.g. Aydtl{.Zar. 2,14; and in a cosmologic fragment Mir.
Man. “ ’v hvsk v X'^Y^ v’ryst, it rained on dry and wet.” The Aw.
formula is interpolated in Yr.19,58:
uwayam hamre^wayani vispa trsuca xsuSraca
Wb. takes the impossible xsivisti as a loc. xsusti, and zme as loc.sg.
“syntaktisch nicht in Ordnung.” The language is indeed Middle Per
sian, with incorrectly reconstructed endings.
What the verses describe is the fabrication of sun-dried bricks, adobe.
In Vid.%,10, the pair zmoikve va zarstve appears, i.e. sun-dried and
burnt brick (see under ‘Industries’). OP. iki > NP. xist is the only
genuine, old form; zmoikve is not an Awestic, but an artificial pseudo
Aw. compound of MP. zam u hik, clay and brick. *xsusti zme, likewise,
is an attempt at rendering an old dvandva “liquid and clay.” The verb



334 YAMA XSETA
for making adobe is “azini, to batter” in Dar.chart.Sus., and visavaya in
Vid.2.,^1. “be-saven-j to make go asunder” of the Pahl. translation, is a
mechanical transcription: vi.savayo is not caus. of Vsyu- “to go,” but,
like “awishuta < ‘awi.suta, pressing (of grapes)” in Y.11,3, caus. of
Vhu- “stamp, press.” The activity is the same when making sun-dried
bricks or wine: treading with the feet. The sandhi-form of the word
proves the pre-Iranian age of the technique. However badly the verses
are transmitted, but xsusti zme visavayante is a formula inherited from
Aryan antiquity. In their homeland the Aryans lived in adobe houses
and drank wine. St.32: “Thereupon Yama did, as AhuraMazdah had commanded, he
trod the clay with his feet, he kneaded it with his hands (the gloss, too,
repeated).” St.33: “Thereupon Yama built the var, as commanded, one
stadium long on all its four sides etc.”
The fact that sun-dried brick is the building material precludes the
translation “Hohle, cave” of var, advanced by Lommel. The purport of
the story is: Yama must learn how to build, for before the threat of
winters men had no need of houses in the paradisiac country. The god
first describes the square plan, and on Yama’s question “which mate
rial.^” he teaches him to make sun-dried bricks. Then Yama builds the
large castrum, four-fifths of a mile square, the plan of which one can
understand with the plan of the qasr Balkuwara at Samarra, exactly
as large as that, at hand.
There is a very obscure point in Vid.2,6: Yama receives from the god
two tools: “(yat he) zaya (frabaram azam yo ahuro mazda) suwram
zaranenim, astramca zaranya.pesim, Pahl.transl. z’y surakawmand ut
astric zarren.p(e)sit.”
In the original myth it was not AhuraMazdah who told the story.
Eliminating these mazdayasnian additions, we have a genuine metrical
fragment. Bartholomae translated “zwei Gerate (Hoheitszeichen),
einen goldenen Pfeil und cine goldgeschmiickte Peitsche”; Darmes
teter: “seal and dagger”; Lommel: “Ring.? und Treibstachel.” Certainly
both are insignia, but primarily practical tools.
astra, RV. vi,53,9 astra, cf. astra.had in Y;.io,ii2, to Vaz-, Lat. “agere,
to drive,” is a stick with (iron) point for goading cattle, originally the
oxen at the plough. Whence “to kick against the prick. Germ, wider



YAMA XSETA 335
den Stachel locken”; Engl, goad to Tent. *gazdo, Lat. hasta, Nord.
geisl. When used for horses, it becomes a whip, OHG. geisala. As in
signia it corresponds to the shepherd’s staff and bishop’s crosier, the
skeptron, scepter of the king or military commander.
Vhad- in the comp. aspa.had and vira.had in Ogmad. 78,
descriptive adjectives of a snake, azi, which “attacks, bites,
stings” men and horses; cf. the figurative zarizafar, the arrow
“with golden mouth” in Y/.io.izp. The verb appears in y/.i4,56,
a song of Iranian soldiers, mocking the Vyamburadiva soldiers,
“haSaho saSan noit haSan, it looks as if they would punch (or
just their lances), they do not punch.” In RV. 6,53,9 pasusadhani
is the epithet of astra, “the goad for stinging, goading or punch
ing catde.”^ “To punch” is used in an old translation of Ezekiel
34,21 for Lat. impingebatis, from pungere, pungent, “because
you punch (Kg.James ‘push’) all the weak with your horns.”
Thus astra.had and pasusadhani are exactly Amer. “cow
puncher.” An old explanation of this word says: “at the end
of each stick is a sharp iron spike with which they punch the
beasts and force them into the cars.”
Vid.2,10 (repeated in 13 and 18) shows the use of the astra. When
the earth had become too small for the increasing humanity,
ho imam zam awisvat / suwraya zaranenya /
Pahl: HN ZNH zamik MDM.spt / p‘n svl’k.’wmnd ZHB’.yn' /
avi dim sifat astraya
’p.s br’ zk svpt p‘n ’kr
The end is clear: “Yama stroke the earth with the stick.” The verb sef-,
sif- is used in a soldier’s charm, Y/.i4,35 and 44-45* “strike the body with
" Jarl Charpentier, in Onent.Stnd.Pai’ty 8ifT.: OI. pusan. Aw. fsu.san, a bucolic deity of cattle-breeders, Aw. vastryaisuyans, is equipped with the astra, the epithet of which, pasusidhani, of course, means “providing cattle/" The epithet of the attribute has nothing to do with the etymology of the name pusan, which mav belong to Ved. Vhan- “obtaining, acquiring possession of,” syn. of Vis-, in Aw. isant, isti, awistar etc [but cf. Aw. Vhan-, OI. sanati]. The stick is for goading, not for “providing” cattle, pasu.s^dhani contains V sad-, Ir. had-, like astra.had. ® In the first charm, separated in the yasht, carrying a wing (feather) or bone of the varangan bird as amulet, or hammering oneself w'ith it, makes invulnerable. In the second charm, which must be united with it because else the indispensable name of the bird would be lacking, four wings are held up against the four directions. In the third charm, two such wings shall fly.' (a-, vi-, fra.dwazan), two shall “rub, sweep” perhaps “be shaken” (a-, vi-, fra.marzan). The translation “to fly” of mrz- in Wb. is unfounded, cf. Hertel, iiqf vn,i82.



336 YAMA XSETA
that wing!”; the noun sepa in F/^.8,87-90 is “forge,” where metals
are “hammered,” see under ‘Industries.’ There the Pahl.transl. writes
spt, here svpt, apparently thinking of “sunb-, suft, to pierce.” For the
verb awi.svat in the first part of the sentence, Bartholomae noted an
otherwise unknown “sav-, sva-, ritzen, to scratch.” Darmesteter linked
it to Vhu', “to press (grapes, homa)”: “he stamped the earth with
the seal.” Lommel: “er trieb sie an mit dem Ring,” to \^hu-, errone
ously “antreiben,” in fact “produce with skill.” All translators derived
the meaning of the verb from the unproved sense they gave the noun
suwra. The right explanation is that of Dastur Peshotan Sanjana, in
cod. DPS of the Pahl.Vid.-. “MDM.spt, better svt or rft, for Aw. awi.svat.”
It is nothing but awi-savat, to Vsyu-, sav-, “to go.” Yama walks over
the earth, in the four directions, with the stick, and makes the earth
widen. The suwra, which misled the translators, has no reason there,
and since the verse is metrically deficient, the words have been inserted
after the model of F/V/.2,io, and must be eliminated. The text was a
good verse:
ho imam zam awi savat avi dim sifat astraya.
suwra: Justi translated “plough”; Bartholomae “arrow,” on account
of the assonance of ShighnI “surb, arrow,” cf. ZAirWb. 233. Darmes
teter “seal,” adducing a passage in IndBdh., where Yama, by virtue
of these insignia, is absolute ruler, and one in the Shahnamah, where
Faridun invests Eric with “sword and seal, ring and crown,” and there
by with the suzerainty over his elder brothers. Neriosengh’s “ring”
could only mean “seal-ring,” but that form is too young for the age
of the myth. The seal of Solomon, too, was no “ring.” The Pahl. transl.
renders suwra by “svl’k.’wmnd, provided with a hole, tube.”® This is
glossed by “mtr’k dstk,” the first word of which is obscure, the second
is “handle”; the words mean scarcely “seal,” rather “lock and key.”
F/^.2,30 (as order), and 38 (as execution) show the use of the suwra:
awica te varfsva and (imperative) . . .
suwraya zaranenya with the golden suwra
apica tam varam marza and this var (acc.) (imperative)
dvaram rocanam hvaroxsnam its door, vent-hole, window
antara.nemat from inside. . . !
° See the description of the mythical water-works, with pipes, under ‘ApamXapat.’



YAMA XSETA 337
awi varfsva must contain the verb of the first sentence, an imperative,
in parallel with marza of the second sentence. The PahLtransl. mis
understood varfsva as “var.manisn^ raS, for the dwellers of the var,”
must therefore supply a verb “(apar)kun,” and by retaining the instr.
suwraya makes the sentence an anakolouthon. The object of marza
(Pahl. “mal, to malidan, to rub, wipe,” not “contrive,” W^.) is “this
varam,” detailed as dvaram, rocanam and hvaroxsnam; the first is
“door,” the second “window” in the old sense of “opening in the roof,”
the third a real window for light, not “self-shining.” “This” shows that
“var” was mentioned in the first passage, in the corrupt varfsva. “an
tara.nemat, from inside”: whatever was done, it was done from the
inside, and Yama must first “go into the var.” Therefore the first line
was : “awica ^tum *varam "^sava, and thou go into the var,” in 38 : awica
ho varam '"savat; nothing but a misreading of m for p (f).
“marza” must mean “shut!”; “and shut the var, the door, the vent
hole, the window!” The Akk. legend of UtNapistim says literally the
same: after the ark was filled and the announced weather signs had
come, “he entered the boat and shut its door,” and when the flood at
last receded, “I opened the vent-hole, nappasu, the daylight fell upon
my nose!”
This is a cogent proof for the emendation awi savat in F;V.2,io, and
for eliminating, there, suwraya zaranenya. It is only 2,30 where one can
see what purpose the suwra serves: a tool to shut the door from inside.
Old doors and windows had bolts at the inside; a Germ, term for them
is “vor-reiber,” “reiben, to rub = mrz, malidan,” which may well describe
the shutting and opening of the bolt.^” Somewhat later, there was a
contrivance to open and shut the bolts also from outside through a key
hole with a key. The words sur’k.’wmnd and mtr’k dstk may have this
meaning. Such a key is the attribute, the sungod Samas holds in hand
in old Akkadian glyptics, when appearing over mountains, having
opened the gates of heaven. The key as attribute may originally have
belonged to Hvar xseta and have been inherited by Yama x^eta.
The ark of UtNapistim, a boat on high seas—see under ‘Navigation’

^had a captain, and his description throws some light on suwra. “To
Cf. Lat. clavis, Ital. chiave, and chiavare = malidan; and similar Arab figurative idioms: wuludj al-mirwad fi l-mukhula, pin of the kohl-box, Aghdni 14,45, tale of ‘Umar and alMughira.



338 YAMA XSETA
the pihu of the boat, the awel malahi, I handed over the ekallu and its
stores, buse.” The awel mal^i is the Arab, “ra’is al-mallahin” or “sahib
al-mata' al-mahmul fi 1-safina, overseer, supercargo, of the merchan
dise transported in the ship.” The same words gloss also Arab, is/s
tiyam, a loanword from Aramaic.^^ S. Fraenkel, Aram.Fremdwdrter
294, quotes an explanation of Aram, istiyama: “an epitropos in whose
hand are the key and seal, overseer of . . . the magazins of an (other)
owner.” The supercargo keeps his stores under lock and key, just as
Yama locks the anbars of the var, in which the animals and stores are
kept, “(h)anbastan, to put into the anbar” is written with the ideogram
HTYMVN, to seal, and signifies also “to seal.” Locking and sealing are
always combined: as early as the stone age, seals are impressed on jar
stoppers. Once, when I had obtained from Ahmad Shah permission to
make a catalogue of the bronze treasure of Baznagird, which was kept
in the throne room at Teheran, the first attempt failed, because the
cupboards were locked and sealed, and the officers in charge no longer
alive. The next day, representatives of seven ministries were appointed,
the seals were broken, and when I had finished, the cupboards were
locked and sealed again.
Thus, seal, lock and key are closely connected. Yet one feature restricts
the meaning of suwra in the Videvdad to “key” : a seal is never impressed
on the inside, and the shutting is done antara.nemat. If suwra is a true
Iranian word, I see no other word to connect it with, but MP.NP.
“suftan, sunb-, to pierce, perforate.” In the VidevdM it is once written
sufra. The Pahl. translator of Fz</.2,io must have thought so when
writing svft for Aw. sifat, with regard to the preceding suwraya. To
the same root belongs the Arab, loanword suftadj, suftah < OP. *suf
taka—cf. Aw. suftidrnga under ‘Mithra’—which means “bill of ex
change, money-order” sent by post and certainly sealed, probably sent
in padlocked mail bags.
The close similarities between the var of Yama and the ark of Ut
Napistim are worth noticing, the more so as it is natural for the ark
to have but one door and one vent-hole, while a building one tacara
ra is al-mallahln the Sumerian word is still alive—is magister nautarum, c£, de Goejc,
BGA IV, Gloss. 271; two recent articles by ‘Abdalqadir al-MaghrabI and Salim al-Djundi, in Rev. dc 1 Acad, dc Damas, 17, 1942, mai-juin and sept.-oct., adduce a passage of abu I-‘Ala al-Ma‘arrI, hit. ’abth al-walidi “The navigators in the sea of Hidjaz call the ra’Is al-markab, captain, al-istiyam; a big fish bears the same name.”



YAMA XSETA 339
long on each side, like the var, ought to have, in the style of the Iranian
legend, “a thousand doors, ten thousand windows.” A feature proper
to the ark seems to have been retained without change by the Iranian
myth. With all its divergencies, the myth of the var belongs to the motif
of the ark of Noah. The Iranian legend, somehow, combined the flood
with the expulsion from paradise. The fact that it mixes different motifs
proves that it is not independent, but had admitted elements from
abroad, long before Zoroaster’s time. Another Babylonian motif is, for
instance, the seven walls of Kanha, built with the seven metals that are
attributes of the Babylonian planetary deities. As early an author as
Herodotus transferred this legend to the town Agbatana. This contact
with Babylon had been taking place since the ninth century, when the
Iranians first appeared in West Iran, and before the foundation of the
Median empire—that is at a period when both Parsua-Persians and
Mada-Medes had been subjected to the Assyrians, whose province
Parsua extended over Kirmanshahan, Nihawand and Hamadan.



XXIII. ARMATIS
“Dilexi iustiriam, odi iniquitatem, propterea morior in exilio”

Gregor VII
Zoroaster, who cursed other gods, has blessed Armatis. In the gathas
she bears often, in the yashts always, the epithet “spanta, the holy,”
hence her MP. name SfandarmaS. She is the goddess of earth, zam;
armatis is an epithet, of Aryan age, for it is Ved. aramatih in the RV.
In the archaic verses of YJiaft. 38—see under ‘Deva’: “This earth here

together with the wives—who bears us—who are Thy wives, Ahura!”
the earth is the bar^rl, that is the primeval IE. notion of the “mother
Earth,” surviving e.g. in TP^s. “zamig ke harv ciz baret.” In the
Greek world the name Safifiarpi, Demeter, maintains the old notion;
in Thrace her name was Semele. The Scolotian Scyths, Herodotus iv,23,
called Zeus TraTrato? and the earth ‘am, “father and mother”; in Phry
gian the opposition of = terrestres,” to “Seoi? = caelestes,”^ in
Thracian the n.pr. Zamolxis and Dialxis (Aisch.), “qui regnat in terra”
and “in coelo,” express the same idea. Also in the Iranian world,
Varuna-AhuraMazdah and Zam-Armatis must once have been a couple,
but Zoroaster’s god had neither wife nor children.
The chthonic signification belonged to the goddess since the same
high antiquity. In Greece it is attested by a remark of Plutarch: “tovs
veKpov<i 'K6j]vcLioL AT)p.T)Tpiov^ wv6p,a^ov iraXaiov, the dead were called
by the Athenians of old ‘those belonging to Demeter.’ ” Such a notion
must have existed in Iranian, for a form of the name identical with
OP. *santa armati passed into Armenian as “sandarmet,” with the
meaning “netherworld,”^ whereas “spandarmet,” derived from the
Median form, means there “Bacchus.” With the Greeks, Demeter and
Dionysus are closely connected.
^ Cf. JokI, in Real!. Vorgcsch. s.v. Phrygia, p.i5i* 2 In Babylonia, the gods of the earth, iImi erseti are the same as the gods of the netherworld, ilani ercs.kigal; their king Nergal is “sar erseti'* or “lugal usipara.” In the Samarra-tablet, Thureau-Dangin, raao iXjipai, he is called “sar lTiawlUm*^V’ which is Hebr. hawila, lxx ’EvtXar, in Gen.2,10: “from Eden goes out a stream . . . and divides , . . in four branches; the name of the first is Pishon, the one who flows round the whole Hawila.” Here, hawlla, like Akk. hawilum, means “the earth, ersetum.” But a gloss says “and there is the gold,” like Job 37,22 “from midnight comes the gold.” The midnight point of the horizon is mount Arallu, “mountain of gold,’ gold is the “product of the netherworld, nabnlt aralli.*’ The midnight point is the gate of hell. And the gloss takes hawila in this meaning, just as the Samarra tablet in calling Nergal “king of Hawilum.”



ARMATIS 341
In Yai3^9, the fravarti, the “manes” of the dead, are called “tusnisad,
sitting in silence,” not as posture, squatting, but as abiding, living in
silence. The association of silence and death sho^vs itself also in the
name of the Roman festival in commemoration of the dead, the sili
cernium: the rest is silence. The form of the word is archaic: tusnisad,
not *tusnishad—cf. armesad in y.62,8 against arime.had in Yz.13,73
and it was created at a time when the dead were still buried in the
earth: the tusnisad live in the hadis of the dead, the netherworld,
armatis.
In the gatha of the vision, Y43,i5, Zoroaster condenses the visions he
saw into the words: “da^sat usyai tusnamatis vahista, thinking-in
silence has taught me to announce . . .” see under ‘Harvatat.’ vahista
has been regarded as object of usyai “to announce the best,” or as at
tribute of tusnamatis, in the vocative “o best one!” and the whole
expression has been interpreted as an allusion to armatis as chthonic
goddess. This is not necessary, but in both cases possible: tusnamatis
as silent meditation can mean armatis, patience, keeping still. In Y/.13,
139 tusnamatis, thinking in silence, appears, strikingly, as the name
of a woman.
It is as goddess of agriculture, Agricultura, that Zoroaster introduced
the mother earth, with other devas that had “chosen” AhuraMazdah,
into the more than TerpaTrpdo’cvTro? nature of his god. These aspects
embody on the one hand the forms of human society, thus armatis
the peasantry, on the other hand that which the good principle has
laid into the souls of these human groups, their specific virtues. This
usage, in the case of armatis, seems not to be an innovation due to
Zoroaster, but an older thought modified.
The passage most important for the understanding of the Zoroastrian
Armatis are the first two stanzas of Y.32:^
I
: ahyaca hvetus yasat ahya vrzanam mat aryamna
ahya deva mahmi mnoi ahurahya rvazma mazda
^woi dutaho ahama tan darayo yoi va dbisanti
2: ebyo mazda ahuro saramano vahu manaha
® Other stanzas of y.32 see under ‘Yama x^cta.*



342 ARMATIS
Xsa^rat haca patimrot rta husha^a huvanvata
spantam va armatim vahvim vrmadi ha no ahat
“Would that the hvetu, the vrzanam with the aryaman, and the gods,
deva, would endeavor to obtain AhuraMazdah’s grace, willing ? : Thy
servants we want to be who hold back those who are Your enemies!
then AhuraMazdah, wedded to Vahumano, would reply through the
mouth of Xsa^ram, he the companion of the sunny Rtam: We love
your armatis, she be Ours!”
Thus the god receives Armatis in “sar,” into the group of his aspects
Vahumano, Xsafem and Rtam. In Y.31,21, in a similar way, Harvatat
Amrtatat are received in “sar” like Rtam, Xsa^ram and Vahumano.
Gods and men endeavor to obtain AhuraMazdah’s rvazman by readi
ness to obey, for which NP. has the picturesque word “kamarbandi,
having their belts tightened.” armatis is a passive attitude: “patience,
keeping still.” For the definition of rvazman see under ‘Welcome.’ But
instead of the normal formula “deva martiyaca, gods and men,” a
triad of men, hvetu, vrzanam and aryaman is here opposed to the gods,
a peculiar qualification which must have a good reason.
mahmi mnoi: “man-, n.. Mass, Art und Weise”; “mah
mi, to ‘ma, mine,’ together: in dem Masse wie ich sie gebe.”
The words are corrupt: the older Mss. have mahmi manoi,
-noit, -no, but the larger number have mahi manoi. Andreas
emended “homoi monoi, in demselben Sinn.” The Pahl.transl.
explains : “ku man menisnih eton fraron cigon Zartust, that we,
as to our willingness, be as excellent as Zoroaster,” hence saw
in mnoi the A^man-, and read perhaps “hama, same” as Andreas
emended. The root man- is beyond question, because direct
oration, characteristic for it, follows; cf. OP. “yadi ava^a man
yahi, if you think, want this” or Aw. “uti ava^a manhano” in
Y?.i9,49, ApamNapat hymn. The form was a participle or ver
bal adjective, most probably manimna; cf. ‘manhamna and the
denom. manahyamna; prev. ham- is possible, cf. MP. “homa
nak, just as, like.” But the whole situation is imaginary, not
real; the answer is conditional.
Gods and men offer their service as duta, Pahl.transl.: tu davak
bavem, avesan apac darem ku sma^ besenend. “^wa dutaho ahama”



ARMATIS 343
can only be a variant of “ahama ratois yusmavatam, we want to be of
your Highness’ servants,” y.29,11, a meaning supported by the parallel
in y.49,7: “yavoi vispai fra.istaho ahama.”
duta appears once more in y.32,13: “kame dutam yo is pat darsat
rtahya, as pleases the duta who keeps them back from beholding rtam.”
In both cases the activity of the duta is to keep hostile people back, not
that of a “messenger” who brings something. In the Veda, Agni is
devanam duta, usually translated “messenger of the gods,” but Hertel
remarks, Siegesf.: “wird nirgends von einem deva zum andren oder
gar . . . von einem deva auf die Erde gesandt, um den Menschen eine
‘Weisung’ zu iiberbringen.” In y.32,1, the Pahl.transl. davak is ex
plained by “rayenitar, who puts in order,” in 13 by “pesopay, forerun
ner.” Such runners, on horse or on foot, hold back the crowd, like the
modern farrash, who were originally cubicularii, but already at the
Safawid period forerunners and executors of punishment, equipped
with hatchet and stick, like the Roman fascigeri. farrash is only the
generic name of the class of servants to which also janitors belong,
darban, TrvXcopot, cf. Arab, “hadjib, huissier, and chamberlain,” from
“hadjaba, to keep back,” Still in 1905, in Isfahan, one used to go or
drive out with such forerunners or foreriders.
Wb. connects duta with a verb “dav-, to distance, remove,” whence
“dura, far,” but the two verbal forms it attributes to it, y;.i,29 and Vid.
5,24, do not belong, duta may be related to MP. “dutak, familia” as
possessions or servants.
AhuraMazdah answers “through (the mouth of) Xsa^ram,” because
this is his social-political aspect. The words “we have chosen your
obedience” express his rvazman, and are, with “She be ours!” part of
the true Zoroastrian creed, as in y.49,2: “spantam ahmai stoi armatim,”
followed in st.3 by “rtam sudyai, rasayahe druxs,” articles of the faith.
y.i2 quotes the formula in the mazdayasnian profession. The god re
turns the declaration of his adherents by his own, because it is a relation
of fealty, a mi^ra, and this is uwaya, binding both parties.
The late Fravarani, y.12, joins to the armatis formula an oath in
which six crimes, theft and robbing of live property, damage to and
unlawful use of immobile property, bodily injury and homicide are
sworn off. This observing of the simple “six commandments” is a kind



ARMATIS
344
of exegesis of the formula “Axmatis be mine!” As ethic norm of actions,
she is obedience to the law, tkesa, morals itself. Society is founded on
feudal relations, and obedience to law is at the same time fealty. Lorn
mel spoils his translation “Fiigsamkeit” by adding “kluge” (for spanta),
for that gives a bad connotation in German: “acquiesce even without
approving.”
In the Karn.Art. 12,14 reads: “Arta;;^ser pa vehih u dendostih ut
ekanakih u framanburtarih e avesan apeguman but, A. convinced
himself of the sincerity of their vehih-vahumano, their dendostih-dena,
their ekanakih, being adyus, and their framanburtarih = armatiL” This
is exactly “we want to be your duta!—I love your Armatis!” and shows
the old idea still alive.
In T-32,3 the thought leaps from armatis to its opposite parimatis
(text under ‘Yama xseta’) : “You gods all and who worships you, are
the brood of Akam mano, the Druxs, and parimatis, and your deeds
for which they glorify you on this seventh of the earth, are dbitana,
dubious.”
parimatis, hybris, is the specific vice of the Iranian nobility, the hvetu,
chastised at the example of Yama. Heraclitus: v^piv xpv o-^f-wvvai
fidkXop 7] Trvpa'iTjv. The “motif of hybris” goes right through the whole
epic. Yama, Sam, kavi Usan, Herodotus’ Deiokes, all catch hybris. In
history, Cambyses goes insane. The medieval Heraclias says of Xusrau
Parwez : “er nam sich an er waere got.” An Arabic hadith^ says : “These
are they who go to hell without hearing: . . . the Arabs because of their
racial fanaticism, ‘asabiyya, the Persian noblemen because of their ar
rogance, kibar, and the scholars because of their jaundice.”
To the hvetu, vrzanam and aryaman, Y.33,4 adds as fourth group the
“gaus vastra, peasantry”; the same four are also mentioned in the pre
ceding st.33,3. Instead of parimatis the similar notion taromatis appears
in these verses: “Zoroaster ‘prays away,’ removes by his song, disobe
dience, asrustim, and evil-mind, akam mano, from four groups : taroma
tim from the hvetu, nazdistam drujam from the vrzanam, ‘^nidanto
from the aryaman, and acistam mantum from the gaus vastra.”
The context is : to whatever station in life a man may belong, he shall
After Siddlql, in Goidzihcr, 'Muhamm.Stud. ii,io8f.



ARMATIS 345
love the faithful and hate the disbelievers. Or, adherence to the religion
shall replace membership of the tribe. Islam proceeded similarly. Until
1914, an Oriental, asked for his nationality, would answer “muslim,”
an answer entirely right, because religion, not race, rules the actions,
and what he who asks wants to know of a man is how he will act
under certain circumstances.
Evil mind and disobedience are qualities of men, and it is unimpor
tant that vrzana and gaus vastra are topical, hvetu and aryaman social
terms. Such terms are always exchangeable. Neither must we expect
in these odes a systematic terminology, nor see in such terms a social
system distinct from others, for instance that of the Y.Haft. or the
yashts. The terminology is rich and nowhere complete, but the choice
is full of meaning. The four groups, without being all, represent the
totality.
For the moment it is enough to ascertain that the group gaus vastra,
i.e. “cattle-pasture,” figurative for neat-herds and shepherds, are lack
ing in y.32,1-2, where the peasantry should be represented first of all,
since armatis is the theme.
The specific aka manah of the four groups belong to two categories
they are either the “vices of their virtues” which Ahramanyus has im
planted in them, or his “gifts” for which they suffer innocently.
y.45,11 elucidates taromati: “Who, therefore, in future, will depise,
taro mansta, the deva and martiya, gods and men that despise Him
[AhuraMazdah, mentioned just before], instead of, anyan ahmat yo,
respecting Him,—the holy dena of the sosyans, the dampatis, will be
his friend, brother and father!”
“tarn-man, pensee hors (de la regie),” is not a quality bad in itself,
but good or bad according to the right or wrong object. The wrong
taromati of the hvetu is directed against other countrymen, aryaman,
vrzanya and vastriya. In the legend of Sam, the Gr.Bdh. ipyf., says:
“He was immortal until he tarmenit den e mazdesnan, despised the
mazdayasnian religion,” whereafter the arrow, shot by a Hiyon, puts
him asleep, see under ‘Ardvisura.’ y.45 is an early gatha, in which
Zoroaster still fights the polytheism, and the “Imitation of Zoroaster”
means, like his own exile, to leave friends and family. The dena of the
sosyans, religion of the saviour, takes the place of the social relations



346 ARMATIS
renounced; the followers enter in “sar”—^reciprocal relationship of the
hvetu—with him. Therefore, the sosyans is called, just here, dampatis,
paterfamilias. One may take dena collectively as religion, or individ
ually as the organ that senses religion, KapSir) ; at any rate, the sosyans
is Zoroaster himself. Cf. Matth. 19,29: “And everyone that hath for
saken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or
children, or lands, for my name’s sake . . and 12,50: “Whosoever
shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my
brother, and sister, and mother.” And the Qtir’an, 9,23-24 says: “If you
love your father and children, your brothers and wives, your relatives,
the property you have acquired, the business the ruin of which you
fear, the houses that please you—more than Allah and his envoy and
the holy war, then expect that Allah will visit you.”
The specific “shady side” of life in a vrzanam, MP. “hamsayakih,
life under the same shade,” is the nazdista druxs, druxs being one’s
close neighbor. Cf. y.50,3: “yam nazdistam ge^am drugva baxsati, the
man who by the power of Rtis will make prosper the farmyard, [be it]
one neighboring [one] ‘hat is the lot of a drugvant.’” The expression
nazdista druxs, characteristic for Zoroaster’s diction, reveals at once
what vrzana is: oppidum and civitas. In town, the neighborhood, the
narrow dwelling among disbelievers is the rule. But this is no vice,
but an Ahrimanic evil from which the vrzanya, citizens, suffer.
,nad3nto‘, '’nidanto, the detriment of the aryaman is less clear. Bar
tholomae took it as belonging to a base *nad-, Lasterer Meillet “qui
I’outragent.” It belongs apparently to Vnid-, ned-, Gr. oi^etSos, OHG.
nit > Germ. Neid; also to “ni8a.sna0is, defying, challenging the arms.”
It may be the defiant, provocative attitude, or the envy, jealousy of the
aryaman, or envy directed against them; probably the first: see “noit
aram,” here below.
The acisto mantus of the peasants is not a vice, but a suffering; the
“worst patron” means their being deprived of rights. They have no
freedom to move, vaso.yati, vaso.siti, they are serfs bound to their
fields and pastures. The Fravarani comprises them under “gaus,” live
property. Y.29,3 speaks of their lot: “nobody knows how the lofty,
rsvaho, deal with the lowly, adran,” that is they are at their mercy.
s A complicated case of putting words governing a relative clause, into this clause.



ARMATIS 347
Or Y.51,14: “the karpano, priests, act noit aram, disregarding the rva^a
datobyasca, lawful customs established for the vastra, pasturage-peas
antry.® Because it is property and slave, gaus,^ the ox is in Zoroaster’s
figurative speech the symbol of the peasant: acista mantu describes his
living at the mercy of the hvetu. In the whole gatha y.29, Zoroaster,
himself an exile without means and protection, is the mantus of peasan
try. In Y.32,15, he says, referring to the special case of those persecuted
as his own adherents: “For this suffering of theirs, those whom they
(the hvetu) do not permit to be masters of their own life, shall drive
to the house of Vahumano.” They are restricted in their jyatus, liveli
hood, like the avrjp aK\r]po<; a prf ^toros ttoXv? eiT] in the Odyssey.

languages, OIr. gav- cow, is difficult to translate. It is as well the generic term—even far
beyond the bovine race—as that of the female. Y.29 is the “Gatha of the Cow.” the speaker is
“gaus urva,” st.5: “ma urva gausca azya, my soul and that of the pregnant cow,” hence “soul of the ox.” azi qualifies the female not so much as “being with calf” but as “grown up.” Without azI and without being opposed to a male, gav- is ambiguous, in a degree which “cow” cannot equal.

Werke das Licht-des-Heils ? Hat sie die Herrschaft Dir zuer

die Du die fruchtbare Kuh hast gebildet, die die Erquickung
uns spendet?”
A complete translation is yet far away, but there is enough to show
that this illogical picture of perplexity and helplessness is wrong, ha^ya,
part.fut. “what will be,” also “what should be,” without moral quality,
means the coming true, realization. The first question does not express
a doubt in the truth of his own teaching, but: “Will you, god, make
come true what I shall say?”, viz. what you have inspired me to say.
And then follow, in form of questions, but as certain as the glorifica
tions of the Gospels, his annunciations.
The verb of the first is obscure: dbanzati. Bartholomae’s first
translation “wird Armati sich erwerben?” rested on a com
parison with Y.46,15: “durch solches Tun erwerbt ihr euch ”
In he assumed “unterstiitzen,” without any other support.
V dbanz-, Aw. banz-, is some judiciary activity of AhuraMaz
dah’s aspects at the last judgment; also of the dogs at the &nvat
bridge, who, in RV. x, 1^,10, watch or waylay? the dead, as
animals of the ruler of the netherworld. The activity seems to be
connected with the “investigation” of the acts of men. As long
as the verb is not determined, one cannot say whether rtam or
armatis is the subject. But armatis is apparently the subject of
cinas in the following verse.
Of this second annunciation the end is clear: ranyaskrti® is a
word of old poetry, originally associated with food, which
later took the acceptation “paradisiac,” Arm. erani = /la/cdpios.
Bartholomae’s “fiir wen (sonst)?” is necessary; otherwise the
cow would appear like a bos ex machina, and the questions
would be disconnected flashes of thought. If the two verses were
syntactically connected, the interrogative kebyo would change
® C£. Bartholomae, ArJorschg. 11,62; Benveniste, jas. 1934, 184; Hertel, Beitr. 102.



ARMATIS 349
into the relative. Bartholomae and Hertel follow a text-critical
pattern, unfit for Awestic text research, in reading “tabyo, to
Thee,” thinking of AhuraMazdah, although Bartholomae read
originally “tebyo, to them” with some Mss. “To thee” would
make Armatis judge over the god: “will Armatis (a partial
figure of the god) through Vahumano (a second figure) confer

or not—upon the god the third figure, xsa^ram,” a question
without sense, still more, when translating armatis by Fiigsam
keit: “will passivity by acts support truth.?” tabyo/tebyo and
kebyo is so conspicuous for ears and eyes—cf. anais a—avais in
y.32,15—that, whatever be the textual tradition, one must read
tebyo. But it is not the “ta, referring back” to “for these (acts)”
but the one referring to direct oration that follows: “those, to
whom . . . for whom else.?”
;^sa0ram in 44,6 is not the “empire of heaven,” but the abstract ex
pression of ownership of cattle, the free command over the livelihood
of the peasantry, which, in Y.32,15, priests and noblemen will not per
mit the followers of Zoroaster to enjoy. The same idea is expressed
in Y.51,6: “Shall the peasant who [because he] is rtavan in his doings,
obtain the ownership of the cow through Rtam [according to the
law].?” and in Y.31,9: “If the cow had the choice to belong either to
the vastriya or to him who is no cattle-breeder, it would choose the
vastriya because he is rtavan.” And the conclusion: “Therefore the non
farmer shall have no share of the accounting!” in 31,10, see under
‘ApamNapat.’ There is no less certainty in these questions than in

The verses speak of an agrarian reform for which Zoroaster stands,
and which the former owners, priests and nobles oppose. That is the
indictment for which he was sentenced to proscription, see under
‘Bandva.’ However, Zoroaster did not want to dissolve society, he did
not come to KaTaXvaeiv top vopov, but to replace serfdom by the volun
tary, sworn-to obedience of the vassal.
Y.30,5: The good in the world’s history is wrought by all

and V hak-, “follow, obey,” is more than “gern,” viz. “by their
own choice, free will.” It corresponds to MP. kamakawmand,
opp. akamakawmand, e.g. Art.Vir.Nam. 1,38-39. With Vx^ou
it is the word for “free obedience.” ha^ya is a Set.

Zoroaster fights against what is called in Exod. 22 ‘nh, or in Islam
“mazalim,” injustice, despoiling of right, a thing apparently adherent
to the shepherd’s life—not at all an “ideal” one—in the East through all
its thousands of years. Islam created against it the “diwan al-mazalim,
the court of appeal” under the personal presidency of the sovereign.
The last origin of the institution seems to be Cyrus’ highest court of the
ySacriXTjtot hiKaarai, Herodotus v,25 and 111,31. The rulers who took
care of it are always specially praised, e.g. the caliph al-Muhtadi in ibn
Khaldun, Tabari and ibn al-Tiqtaqa. Ibn al-Athir says, in the necrologue
of Nur al-din, this remarkable ascetic on the throne: “He built every
where in his countries dar al-‘adl, a house of justice, in which he used
to give audience together with his qadi al-Shahrazuri, administering

ARMATIS 351
justice to the oppressed—be it a Jew, against the oppressor—be it his
own son or first amir.” And just so Darius begins his testament entirely
in the spirit of Zoroaster; “I love what is right, I hate what is wrong!
It is not my pleasure that the lowly suffer injustice for the sake of the
lofty!”
y.33,5 speaks of the specific vices or detriments of the various classes
Y.Haft. 40,3, one could say, of their specific virtues: “Give that the
na(=hvetus) rtavan be rtacanah, eager to fight, that the vastriya,
peasants, be adyus, vassals, for long (= continuous, hereditary) zealous,
bozvate?^” vassalry, haxman, both in-fealty-towards-us, ahma.rafnah!”
These verses are post-Zoroastrian.
Zoroaster uses gaus and vastra, alone or together, as metaphoric ex
pression for peasants; in the same way, armatis is on the one hand their
transcendent personification in the multiple nature of his god, on
the other hand their specific virtue, their patience, obedience to law,
founded on or being the foundation of Rtam, the social order. In Y.
33,4 the antonym to armati is “asrusti, disobedience,” as aka manah to
vahu manah. In Zoroaster’s phraseology, therefore, this specific armati
of the peasants is the virtue, dperi), itself: the patient resignation to the
order, Rtam, to God’s will, or with Darius’ words in NiR a,57: “hya
oramazdaha framana ho.te gasta ma ^andaya! what Oramazda has
allotted to you, shall not seem hellish to you!”
That is the reason, why, in the passage Y.31,11, from which we
started, where AhuraMazdah “chooses” Armatis, just the peasants
which she personifies are not mentioned, and why, there, in the normal
formula deva martiyaca, the three classes hvetu, vrzana and aryaman
replace martiya. Zoroaster voices a hope: “Would that the gods and
[among men] the noblemen, the townsmen and the clients endeavored
to obtain AhuraMazdah’s grace, willing.^: Thy servants we want to
be ... , then AhuraMazdah would reply: I accept your armatis, your
obedience which is like that of the peasants!” But this is only a hope,
and the gods and those men do not do it in their parimatis, hybris.
Therefore the thought goes on: at all times you have been like that,
all the heroes of your history, whom you glorify as “beloved by the

gods,” Yama first of all, have been nothing but enah, v^pl^ovre<i.
But AhuraMazdah, who knows their rixta, loves only obedience, arma
tis, the virtue of the despised peasants: paKapioi oi Trpaets!
That is the new ethical and social idea of Zoroaster, Y.44,9: “moi
yam yds denam dane, I who want to purify, reform the religion!”,
his transvaluation of values. Nyberg, 202: “Es findet sich keine Spur
von einem Reformator bei Zarathustra, er behauptet leidenschaftlich
das Bestehende.” And while describing his Zoroaster without agrarian
interests, but preaching “sermons” against other sects and composing
an “oral preface” to the second edition of his “hymns” collected for
the liturgical use of his parish, he goes on: “Das Bild eines fortschrit
tlichen Landpfarrers mit Interesse fiir agrarische Reformen, das die
Forschung des 19. Jahrhunderts von ihm zu entwerfen pflegte, ist
sicher sehr bezeichnend fiir das, was diese Zeit als zu einem richtigen
Religionsstifter gehdrig ansah”—the picture of a drunk shaman drawn
in the early 20th is not even that—^“es ist unter geschichtlichem [and
every other] Gesichtspunkt von Anfang bis zu Ende verkehrt.”
It may be a consequence of Zoroaster’s new interpretation of the
goddess of Earth as aspect of AhuraMazdah that the Awesta retained
so little of her pre-Zoroastrian cult and character. The gods banished
by Zoroaster brought a good deal of their old hymns with them when
they returned into the Mazdayasnian religion. But there is no Armatis
yasht. Y^.ig, the Zam-yasht, is very long, but, excepting karda i, it is
dedicated to the Hvarnah, not to Armatis, in spite of its name “Zam,”
and this first chapter is no more than a list of names of mountains, a
choice from 2,244, an orographic catalogue void of religious contents.
In the epics a few features of the myth of the goddess are preserved,
e.g. her flight before the dragon AziDahaka. All the rest is lost, and
even her name Armatis remains obscure, the often discussed problem
of its etymology unsolved.
In the RV., cf. Hertel, Beitr. chapt.ii, aramatih is enumerated between
rta, dyaus, namas (prosternation), and Indra, mitra, varuna, bhaga and
others, but, as Hertel says, the Indian tradition was no longer sure about
the meaning of RV. aramatih.^ Hertel calls the etymology, given on
Just as the Pars, tradition had forgotten what Aw. armati meant. The Eur. dictionaries follow the etymology accepted by the Petersh. Wdrterbtich, on the strength of a commentary



ARMATIS 353
the authority of Sayana in the FfV. “unsinnig,” and whatever one thinks
of his own, that one is wrong, and the true etymology remains to be
found.
One can imagine that the notions earth as agriculture and obedience,
patience as special virtue of the agriculturists became connected. But
if one word could designate these two notions, then its etymological
meaning must express the tertium comparationis, and its sphere would
be “labor, field-labor.”'^ Bartholomae regarded armati as compound
“aram + mati, to think according [to rules],” and therefore makes
his article in begin with armati as opp. to taro.mati. Why this
“thinking” became the name of the earth remains a riddle. Duchesne,
on the contrary, states, §113: “taromati, ‘acte de penser de travers,’ ne
prouve rien pour I’etymologie de I’indo-ir. armati ; il prouve seulement
que le mot a etc compris depuis la redaction des gathas jusqu’a celle
des Purs, comme comp, d’aram et de mati.” Even these last words con
cede too much.
Zoroaster uses an entirely personal phraseology when teaching in
y.45,11, to despise, taro-man, those who despise AhuraMazdah, instead
of respecting him, aram.man-. This intentional playing upon words
is an example of his hunartat, virtuosity, his mastership of the lan
guage, hizvo xsayamno vaso. Meillet says, Trois Conf. 61: “taromati
‘pensee hors (de la regie)’ est fait pour s’opposer a armati . . . , [il y a]
un artifice theologique dans la forme de ces oppositions.” When used
in the sense “obedience,” the name of the goddess of Earth, armati, is
interpreted as if it meant 'aram.mati, “pensee selon (la regie).” There
fore, this cannot be its meaning; the artificial play forbids an assump
tion of etymologic connection.
With equal or better right one could state: In Y.43,15 Zoroaster
alludes to armatis vahista by the words tusnamatis vahista. Compounds
with locative as first element are an archaic type, in this very case con
firmed by the use as n.pr.—Tusnamatis and armatis are opposed like
tusnisad and armesad (Fravarti, Yr.13,29 and 73) “living in silence”
of Sayana on JtF.vin,3i,i2. While he equates aramatih in RI''.vii,36,8 etc with ’‘prthivi, earth,'’ in VIII,3 1 in the sequence “mountains, rivers, pusan (.Vw. fsusan) wealth, bhaga, unit adhva
(the broad path),’’ he considers it as attrib. adj. to stotpanah—omitted, but to be supplied

“people who praise pusan, = alam.mati.’’ Cf. Fr. labour, Engl. labor (with child) or travail, against Fr. travail; the earth as barffri; also Germ, arbeit, Slav, rabdta “corvee.”

and “living in quiet,” words, the pre-Iranian age of which is docu
mented by the sandhi-form and by the correspondence with Gr. crLyrj
and 'qpejjLa keeping silence, and keeping still, be patient. This
is another play upon words, but no etymology.
Evidently, the word was so old and so isolated that, in Zoroaster’s
time as already in Vedic times, it had no longer any purport. The
spelling armati is strictly carried through, but armati—which does not
result from aramatih—always counts for four syllables. Markwart,
Gath.uh. 6of., tried to explain the trisyllabic spelling as abstracted from
the pronunciation sfandarmaS at the time when the Awestic script
was invented. If the oral tradition was aramati, this would be im
possible, for Atarpat could introduce a new spelling only when rectify
ing the meter. The pronunciation must have been armati, counting for
four syllables, before the invention of the Aw. script.
A similar though simpler case is dena; bisyllabic spelling is stricdy
carried through, but the word always counts for three syllables. In this
case the pronunciation dena is attested as early as 520 b.c., for the tablet
Susa 20 has the Elam, loanword ta.t.te.ni.m, i.e. 'dat.denam,^^ instead
of OP. “framatar, law-giver” and NiR .4,57 has te.ni.m for OP. fra
mana, Akk. uta‘ama. El. te.ni.m renders denam, not ‘dayanam. With
a trisyllabic dena and a four-syllabic armati Zoroaster uses—right or
wrong—forms no longer living at his time.
There was an OP. rmatam, with which armatis can be connected,
rmatam, as form, corresponds to Lat. armentum, armatis to Lat. semen
tis. It appears in the Elam, version of Beh. §47. The OP. text runs:
“rsada nama di8a“ harahvatiya avapara atiyais, to a castrum named
Rsada in Arachosia, there he marched.” After harahvatiya the El. ver
sion adds: ‘“rmatam wiwanana, an rmatam of Vivana.” The placename
Rsada < 'rsa.hada, to Vhad-, means “stud,” i.e. an area where horses
were bred. The situation must be that of Aspacora {Tab.Peut.), mod.
Asfuzar, “horse-pasture” in Arachosia. Thus the rmatam of Vivana, a
plantation, urvara, with castrum in this horse-pasture country, was a
ranch.
Possibly OP. ‘data.deni-, abstr., unless the El. ending -im will become otherwise explained.
di5i > diz is (enclo'-ure) wall; OP. paridaiSa > Gr. paradeisos, the garden, characterized
by Its enclosure. The El. \ersson has the loanword •'aUvarns, an OP. noun in -is, < OP. *arvaris
(undetermined quantiti, also color o£ the vowels), probably deriv. of OP. urvara “plantation.”



AfiMATIS 355
The etymologic connection of urvara and apovpa has been proposed,
but rejected on the ground that V ar- “to plough” is not attested in the
Aryan branch of IE. Arguments from absence are never strong, espe
cially because old local names may contain roots otherwise obsolete.
Lat. armentum are the animals of agriculture, large cattle, oxen and
horses, compatible with OP. “rmatam, ranch.” And armatis, as abstract,
is to rmatam, as Lat. sementis to armentum. One day the etymology of
armati will be found. Until then, one had better not introduce a dif
ferent spelling.



XXIV. harvatat-amrtatat
Like Armatis, the pair harvatat-amrtatat has been admitted by Zoro
aster into his concept of AhuraMazdah.
harvatat, n.abstr. of harva, whole, is oXottjs, “wholeness, physical in
tegrity,” then “health,” but also “abundance,” and Plutarch renders the
personification, much to the point, by “Ploutos,” son of Demeter
ArmatiL amrtatat, n.abstr. of *amrta, Ved. amrta, a/iySporo?,^ is “im
mortality,” personified “ambrosia.” The dvandva was at first harvatata
amrtatata, the second dual especially liable to haplologic shortening:
amrtata. Yet in most cases harvatat keeps the first place, showing
that the dvandva is older than the shortening, which is common
already in the gatha. Then, harvatata became harvata, and the move
ment ended in NP. Arab. HaruS u MaruS.
The essence of the two powers is clearly expressed in Y/.19.96:
^vanat harvasca amrtasca Harvat-Amrtat will conquer
uwa suSamca trsnamca both, famine and drought.
Benveniste describes the dvandva as “projection mythique” of apa
urvare, water-plants, which itself means the grain of the irrigated fields,'
and is the prototype, extremely old, of quite a group of dvandvas, all
variations of “liquid and solid.” In harvatat all saps of plants and ani
mals are embodied, and, to apply amrtatat to the vegetable kingdom,
involves a deep insight: the up-rooted animal has paid the price of a
determined, short life for its freedom of movement.
y.31,21:
mazda dadat ahuro harva[ta]to amrtatasca
burois a rtahyaca hvapa^yat ^sa^rahya saro
vahos vazdvar manaho yo hoi manyu syo^naisca rva^o
“AhuraMazdah by his perfect union with Harvatat-Amrtatat, Rta and
Xsa^ra, may give the draught of Vahumano to him who is his friend
in mind and acts.”
“sar,” in the social sense “connubium,” is here as elsewhere the word
for the union of the partial figures, or aspects, of the god. One cannot
fail to feel another opposition besides “liquid and solid”: harvatat
^ Cf. '^am(h)rka <[ ahmaka in Y.32,8 under *Yania Xseta/ 2 Benveniste, bsos viii,405, Ved. and Aw. urvara = cultivated soil.



HARVATAT-AMRTATAT 357
belongs to this life, to time, amrtatat to the hereafter, to eternity. The
god is wedded to the pair in his double quality of “lord of
time,” and of rtam, the “eternal.” harvatat means “blessed life on earth,”
amrtatat the “eternal life.”
Y.51,7:
dadi moi yo gam taso apasca urvarasca
amartata harvata spanista manyu mazda
tavisi utiyuti manaha vahu sanhe
“Give me. Thou who hast created the cow, the waters and plants, im
mortality and health as Spanto Manyus, o Mazdah, force and longevity as Vahumano, in Thy commandment!”
I leave utiyuti for better definition, amrt-ata harvata are eternal life
and blessed life here, Arab, al-dunya wa 1-akhira. The dying caliph al
Muntasir says to his mother: “I have forfeited al-dunya wa 1-akhira !”,
Tabari 111,1495. Since the wishes are for this and the other world,®* sanhe
cannot mean “bei dem Richterspruch = last judgment” (Bartholomae),
but must be the same as sasnaya in the next verses, Y.29,7:
tarn azutois ahuro man^ram tasat rta hazoso
mazda gavoi x^vidamca ''huhursebyo spanto sasnaya
The dvandva x^vida-azuti, “aliments liquides et solides” (Ben
veniste), is one of the variations of apa-urvare and appears in Y/.i6,8 in
parallel with harvatat-amrtatat. hazoso: cf. Y.33,2: “who does harm,
aka, to the drugvant, is quite to the taste, zosai, of AhuraMazdah.”
"^huhursebyo, reading corrected by Tedesco, zii, 11,1923, 43f., is regular
desid. of Vhvar-, “to eat, drink.”
Meillet, Trois Conf., translated: “La formule de graisse, A.M.
saint I’a construite d’accord avec Asa, pour le boeuf, et aussi le
lait pour ceux qui veulent le consommer, par son enseigne
ment.” Andreas, nggw 1931, 111,322, attributed the fact that
Xsvidam (acc.) is not, as usual, in the same case as azutois
(gen.) to “Laxheit der Konstruktion, viell. xsviSom as gen.pl.”
The construction is right : in Y.49,2, the subject of the quotation
“ahmai stoi armatim!” stands in the acc., because it is governed
by “ddrst”: “He professes: armatim (acc.) be mine!” The
Cf. ' ‘rayo rtis, award of riches, and life in paradise” in y.43,1, under ‘Fras'arti.’



358 HARVATAT-AMRTATAT
words “azutim gavoi, ^svidam huhursebyo” are the quotation,
and the gen. azutois is governed by mantra, MP. mansr, usually
“dictum, poem,” but here, with only one verse, “proverb.”
Mantra as “adage” occurs once more in the frgm. Nirang.2:
“apastak cigon dat: mayno man^ro,” with Pahl. transl. “fra
man, rule (for measuring).” Wb. links mayno to “mayna,
naked” as “bloss = bare, pure,” and compares 01 . nagna and Gr.
gymnos. Then, it can be “"nayno man^ro, the proverb of the
bread” (about daily bread or salt and bread), whether mayno
be correct or to be corrected in *nayno > NP. nan, nun. This
would be the only instance of the word for “bread” in the
Awesta, a warning not to infer from such absence that a thing
was unknown, as in the case of “salt.”
“The adage (of the) ‘azutim for the cow, milk for the thirsty,’ Ahura
Mazdah, like-minded with Rtam, has coined it, the holy one, by His
command.” It goes on: “Whom doest Thou have among men, who
would attend to us two [bull and cow] ? I have found only one who
follows Thy commandment in our favor: Zoroaster!” The Pahl. trans
lation adds: “an mizd e ac mansr petak, that reward [viz. which the ox
receives from men for its labor] which the adage makes clear.” Zoro
aster says: The obvious wisdom of the proverb ought to be the divine
rule for the attitude of the peasant towards the cattle, or in his figura
tive style, of the ruling towards the peasants.
Nyberg, 197, explains azutois man^ram differently : “Das Gotteswort
von der Begiessung, azuti, fiir den Stier geschaffen. Begiessung sollen
die Kiihe vom Menschen dafiir erhalten, dass sie ihm die Milch liefern,”
and concludes from this wrong translation: “In Y.29,7 bedeutet ^uti
die Begiessung des Weideplatzes mit Kuhurin zum Gedeihen der
Weide.” In F/ff.13,28 this same azuti is called “the proper diet of the
dog,” but letting that pass along with the other anomaly that grass
would grow—to prevent a middle-sized herd of 5,000 head on about a
hundred square miles^ from doing the sprinkling themselves would
require an army of cowboys.
2 The Assyrian annals often give the numbers of cattle carried away, e.g. Sanherib, prtsnt i,46ff.: 7,200 horses, 11.(72 donkevs. 4.233 camels, 200.100 (v.l. 80,100) cows, 800,600 (v.I. 800,100) sheep.” On the Nesaean pasture Alexander saw still 60,000 or the original 160,000
horses. Genesis 31 —much older—regrettably docs not give the numbers of Jacob’s cattle.



HARVATAT-AMRTATAT 359
The care of the cattle—cf. the Gath, term godayah, lit. cow-nurse, for
cowboy, under ‘Social Structure’—-is also the theme of Y.48,5;
“Good-rulers (perhaps better ‘economists’), not bad-rulers shall gov
ern us with the works of the good Gistis, 0 Armatis !”
yozda martiyai api.zan^am vahista
gavoi vrzyatam tarn no hvar^ai fsuyo
Bartholomae translated at first, Ar.Forschg. 11,167: “Heilschaff dem
Menschen (und) Nachkommenschaft!” with api.zan^am as compound;
but W^.85 : “Vollbringe fiir den Menschen die kiinftige-Geburt, fiir das
Rind die Landwirtschaft, lass es feist werden zu unserer Nahrung!”,
a twisted translation, made with regard to the two places, 5,21 and 10,18,
where the verse is quoted in the Videvdad, the worst authority for
gatha-interpretation. Lommel paraphrases only: “die fiir den Menschen
die kiinftige-Geburt (in Lauterkeit) vorbereiter, fiir die Kuh die Werk
thatigkeit, um sie fiir uns zur Nahrung zu pflegen.” One wonders.
Nyberg enhances Bartholomae’s “kiinftige-Geburt” to “Wiedergeburt,”
analyzes, on the strength of this hypothetical hapax, Zoroaster’s notions
about “birth and rebirth,” otherwise unattested, and finally pronounces:
“Das ideale Hirtenleben in einem von alien hemmenden Schranken
befreiten stamm wird hier als das grosse Endziel hingestellt.”
Wb. posits a verb *fsav- only for this fsuyo in y.48,4, “well
das Gath, keine o-nominative von ant-Stammen kennt,” giving
it the arbitrary signification “fett machen.” Since the logical
consequence would be that cattle grow fat from labor, to assume
that the poet or a copyist allowed an o-nom. to creep in would
be the “interpretatio facilior.” The eschatologic interpretation

a tendency that impairs Bartholomae’s work only too often

is prevented by the second part of the verse : in “life in purity,”
according to Mdh Frav., one did eat no beef, or as Theopomp
says, nothing at all. Also, while the ox is allowed to be slaugh
tered, jadyai, the cow is “agnya, not-to-be-slaughtered,” and the
verses have milk and cheese in mind. In Vid.%21, api.zan^am
is correctly written as compound, following a text a thousand
years older than our Mss. It means “progeny, offspring.”^ The
III ZAirWb. 179 Bartholomae cites from the Gan] i §dh. (Pahl. Texts 1,45) a word in Aw. script which he takes as dat.pl. of pati.cant-: “which man is pati.canbyo' Who after his father

meter, 5 + 6 between 4 + 7 syllables, is not of necessity faulty.
Hertel, Beitr. (rjL, takes vahista as instr., attribute to armatis
of the preceding verse. I prefer vocative at the end of the sen
tence. He takes vrzyatam as 3.sg. imper.med. “fiir das Rind
arbeite der Viehziichter, fsuyo, damit es uns ernahre.” The
second tam, left unexplained by Hertel, looks like a dittography,
and Tedesco told me that, to compensate it, one may read "hvar
^aya for hvar^ai, as in Y.34,11; hence:
48,5 : gavoi vrzyatam no *hvar^aya fsuyo
“Make healthy, to men, their offspring, o best one! For the
cattle, that it may nourish ourselves, the farmer shall work!”
Cistis is here, and in the entire Den-Gaslit 16, Zoroaster’s substitute for
Usa, the goddess of dawn and of labor; she is also midwife and
physician.^ The simple train of thought is: good government, healthy
children, ample food, all this Armatis gives as Agricultura, embodied in
AhuraMazdah.
Not Aw. “xsvid, milk,” but OP. *xsifta, to OP. Vxsip-» Aw. xsviw-®
lives on in the West Ir. dialects. The verb describes the rotating and shak
ing movement which separates cream and whey. The OP. noun exists
in Ctesias’ (Photius) crnrTaxopa, in a recently discovered text of Psel
lius^ ^T^raKcopa, Pliny “psitthacora.” Ctesias translates it by yX.vKv, r]Svi
the variants give *inTTaxcopa as form used by himself, OP. 'xsiftahvara
NP. siftaxur, “sweets,” as Tychsen recognized 150 years ago.® The usual
Aw. word for milk is payah, to V pi-, Pahl.transl. pern < peman. An
article of food as important as “mast, Turk, yoghurt, Arab, laban, cur
dled milk” cannot be missing in the Awesta: it is x^udra, adj. xsaudri,
“o skanb c matar Savet, NP. pas uftad,” which can hardly mean anything but “posthumous.” The explanation is based on the phonetic similarity of OIr. canb- and Mir. skanb, and the inverse correspondence of OIr. sk: Mir. c. It is written with the c which takes the place of z

without exception—in MP. fracant <[ frazanti, “progeny,” e.g. inscr. Firuzabad, I.5: mtrnrshy v.s frcndyn, “Mihrnarseh and his progeny,” also in the Pahl. Psalter, pati.cant- seems to be MP. pati.zant, comparable to fra.zanti and api.zan^a. ^ Cf. Ula-Eos in ^^Ulanges Cumont, Ann. Inst, phil.-hist. orient, iv, 1936, 731!^. Cf. Hubschmann, Pers.Stud. 82.

HARVATAT-AMRTATAT 361
also payah ^saudri; the translation “wine, beer, alcoholic” is totally
wrong. Vid. 16,17: “two portions of tayurinam (yavanam), one of
Xsaudrinam shall be dispensed to the menstruating,” certainly not
“beer”; Pahl.transl. is “ter nan (lhm’), cheese bread” and “svsr as,” as
< OP. is porridge, hence “barley in mast.”® x^udra therefore is
a deriv. of x^vid, probably both to Vx^bd- “to foam.” Aw. tayuri or
turi, MP. ter, NP. panir, cf. Gr. rupo? and ^ovrvpo<;, is “cheese.”
The crux is azuti, coupled with x^vid in the dvandva. It is Ved.
ahuti, to V ZU-, whence such words of high Aryan antiquity as “zotar,
libans; zo^ra, libation.” Ved. ahuti is said to be an offering of pre
served, i.e. melted butter, buttered again, and would be Aw. royna,
MP.NP. royan, a thick, oily preserve, well known all over the East.
Study of the Aw. passages does not confirm this signification in Iranian,
and in Vedic, too, ahuti must not mean oil because oil is used as ahuti.
In the poor y/.i2,3 azutim urvaranam appears beside roynya varah,
ordeal-butter, and avi prnam viyzarayantim. This is the only place where
axuti is qualified by a material, “of grains,” in the Awesta. Wb. trans
lates “Schmalz der Pflanzen,” unknown to me, perhaps meant for
“vegetable oil.” The Gr.Bdh. enumerates “sesame, two kinds of hemp,
sahdang and dusdang, and olives” as oil-producing plants. To prna,
Bartholomae remarked “zu der iiberfliessenden Hohlhand, prna to Lat.
palma.” prna never appears without the epithet; it is the fem. of the
adj. prna, hence “full, overflowing,” scil. jug or flat bowl for libations,
hydria or phiale.
Had.N.2,j^ (repeated in Ogmad.)
hvar^anam he baratam zaramayahya roynahya
Duchesne: “Qu’en fait d’aliments on lui [Vahumano, rising from his
golden bed for breakfast] apporte du beurre printanier, that is the food
of the blissful heroes after death!” In 2,36, the damned sinners get
“visaya and visgantaya, poison and of-poison-smelling food.” “zahr,
poison” is the antonym of “anosak, ambrosia” in the chapter on op
posites in the Gr-Edh-^ji. The preceding paragraph says: “the fravarti
give the souls of the immortals, anosravan, food of immortality, anos
Xvarisn, such as is made in spring.” And afterwards: “with water,
wine, milk and honey.” Milk and honey symbolize sweetness ; the most

common word for “sweet” is siren, lit. “of milk,” used as transl. of
Xsvid. In Vid.11, “siren u carp, sweets and oil, fat” translates “xsvida
azuti,” but the commentary says “nayn u spetvak,” i.e. bread and is
pidba, the latter being something made of curdled milk, mast.
Ir. azuti cannot be royan, for this is never given to cows, as in Y.
28,7, nor to dogs, as in Vtd.ii,^^:
paro xsvisca azutisca Here, with milk and azuti,
along
gaus mat baratu hvar- wdth meat it shall be
0anam brought, as fodder,
sunahya (eva) he da^ya.- that is the proper meal of
pi^wam the dog!
azuti functions in this dog’s diet beside milk and flesh; besides, it is
given to cattle. Actually, no fodder at all is given to cattle, either in
summer or in winter. The caretaking consists in driving them to the
right places where they find their grazing themselves. But the all
important question is watering, for water is rare, and not at all acces
sible at all pastures, it must be pumped or by other means conducted
to the watering troughs. Hence, azuti is a word not qualified by any
material at all, it is merely the providing of drink; as “libation” it is
drink-offering to the gods, else it is watering cattle and dogs: thus
azuti is the “mizd” for xsvid.
This research has revealed, at the same time, that there was a notion
of “immortal food” strictly vegetarian. Meat diet is expressed by “pitu,
etym. = fat,” thus in the dog’s ration, “ptbg, i.e. pitubaga, meat-ration,”
cf. Akk. pitipabagu or pitpibagu'® < Ir. 'pi^vabaya, in Daniel i, is the
term for the provisioning of the somatophylakes which receive rations
instead of pay. Daniel and his companions become vegetarians to avoid
eating meat not kosher. Dinon explains TroriySa^ts < *paituba|is as
“bread, cypress-wreath and wine,” quite unlike the food of the heroes
after death. TPars. pid u may ne xvarem, ac zan dur pahrezem (Bailey,
Bsos VII, 753) is avoiding of meat and wine as abstinence. In the legend
of Azidahak, meat diet makes bloodthirsty. Mdh Frav. §40: At the end

of the world humanity will be immortal and not aging, and will need
no more food. 41: Who has touched meat, will be resurrected only after
50 days, the others after 15. Meat diet takes the acceptation of food in
general, for instance in the comp, “bipi^wa, ^ripi^wa, receiving two,
three meals, fra.pi^wa, well-fed, MP. hamesag.pihan, continuously fed”
all said of fire, opposite of ahvarta hvarnah, the hvarnah that burns
“needing no food.”
In Y.49,5 (borrowed in F/<^.9,53) we find iza azuti instead of xsvida
azuti: “izaca azutica will be his who unites his faith with Vahumano
all of them in Thy kingdom, o AhuraMazdah!” In st.ii follows the
opposite: “but whose faith is evil, will be received ... (in hell) with
evil food, akais hvar^ais.”“ Being interchangeable with
must be a synonym, and at the same time a heavenly food, as antonym
to hellish food.
Y.49,10:

nipahe: in Y.28,11 the god ni.pa-, “takes charge of” what man
“deposits, ni.da-.” Upon the acc. objects of b-c three nom.dual
follow without further verb, connected by the rel. ya: the enu
meration goes on, but is no longer grammatically governed by
nipahe.^' armatis follows upon namasca as in RV. aramatih
upon namas. izaca stands between it and manza.xsa^ra which is
“banquet” (see under ‘Hospitiurii’). The following vazdaha
,av3mira‘, soon to be discussed, belongs to the same sphere, iza,
here in st.io as well as in 5, means a heavenly food.^^ The dual
may mean “the two iza,” viz. iza azuti, which is a variant of
Xsvida azuti, itself analogous to apa-urvare and harvatat-amrta
Also in y.31.20 and 5^,6 used for “helliNh food." “ya (those things) which (are),” if referring to the foregoing - “also”; if to the following
= “like.”

tat. In Y.34,11 this last pair is called “hvar^ai, the two foods.”
iza designates a concrete, nothing abstract, it must be a sap or
draught.^^
vazdaha ,av9mlra‘: Bartholomae linked the hapax vazdah
to vazdvar, ¥.31,21 (see above), and translated “bestandig, sta
ble” and “stability.” Against this, Andreas-Wackernagel, nggw
1911, 32, called Geldner’s connecting of vazdah with Ved.
vedhas “evident”: “i?F.x,86,io vedha rtasya : Aw. rtavazdah,
’ApraovdcrST]?, viell. zu Vvad- ‘fiihren,’ also vazdvar in Y.
31, 21 ‘Fiihrerschaft.’ ” Hertel, iiqf vii, i5of., modified this to
“Fiihrungsfahigkeit,” something like “ability to command one’s
body, coordination.” The n.pr. krsavazdah, which means
neither (Bartholomae) “magere, d.i. geringe Ausdauer besitz
end,” nor “meager leadership,” does not fit; therefore it is
probably not Vvad- “fiihren.” From the Aw. passages one can
only infer: (i) as tanuvo vazdvar, bodily v., it stands in parallel
with drvatatam “integrity of the body,” ¥^.14,29; (2) it is a
“gift of the waters” Y.68,ii; (3) an “award” the believers ob
tain in paradise, Fii.9,44. Benveniste objected to “vazdvah, be
standig” : “alors que seul est etabli un neutre vazdah ‘sant^’ ”
but his reasons are unknown to me.
A misinterpreted passage in ¥^.8,43 (text under ‘Tistriya’)
is conclusive: “Satavesa washes off all illnesses, all vazdris
uxsyati,^® i.e. makes grow all medicinal herbs, heals all crea

VirJ<Idm.x, the souls of the deceased say to Artaviraz as welcome in
paradise: “ ’nvs ‘sxHn, drink immortality, that you may see here ramisn,
peace eternally.” vazdaha-avamira are nectar and ambrosia, the food
at the manza. ^sa^ra, the banquet of the souls in the house of Ahura
Mazdah. The dvandva is closely related to harvatat-amrtatat.
One may apply to it all the investigations made on Gr. nectar and
ambrosia. These, too, are very old words, meaning “not-being-dead” and
“not-dying,” but, in course of time, interpreted as different foods and
drinks. There was certainly a connection between the Greek and the
Iranian notion, as old as the motif of the Yama myth, with its taboo
on meat.
A peculiar heavenly food appears also in the Mithra Yasht. In 10,135,
see under ‘Mithra,’ the four white horses of the god are called immortal
and manyushvar^a. This is Ar. *maniu.suartha, and means neither
(Darmesteter, Nyberg) “den Luftraum zur Nahrung habend”—that
would be “consuming parasangs, Kilometerfresser” or “living on air,”
nor (Wb.) “Nahrung des Geistes bildend”—that would be the device
on the old Berlin Library “nutrimentum spiritus,” but “feeding heavenly
food,” in y.56,2 “being heavenly food.” It is the reason why the horses
are immortal, anosa. The notion is pre-Iranian, and as early as in the
Aryan period manyu, manyava must have been a synonym of deva,
heavenly. From the beginning it implies the opposition of the MP.
transcendent menok to the earthly getik.
In Y.32, hu|yati replaces harvatat in the dvandva. St.5: “Thereby
you have cheated man out of hujyati and amrtat, good-living and im
mortality.” hujyati, etym. close to Gr. hygieia, means, like euySioro?,
Lat. vita < Vivita, life on earth, without the faintest eschatological
afterthought (Wb.: “insbesondere im Jenseit”) : the beggar wishes it his
benefactor. It is opposed to life in the hereafter, amrtatat, as OP. syata in
this world to rtavan. In it summarizes the preceding words “fat
cattle, fat pasture, fat dogs, fat women, fat children, fat (= well-nour
ished) fires.” The strange sequence is first outdoor, then indoor. To
be fat is the visible sign of a successful life. There can be nothing more

earthly than hujyati. Epicharmos says: avSpl h'vyialveLV aptcrrSv ecrri,
and Simonides: “First good thing for man is health.”
In the Yama-myth, the hero surpasses the gods “in riches and
prosperity, breeds of cattle and herds, satiation and ‘proclamation,
the two foods never decreasing, cattle and men not-dying, waters and
plants never dry. Altogether this is '^vispa.hujyatiL Vispam.hujyatim
in Y/.5,i30, is a compound, wrongly inflected, one syllable too long, and
can be restored from Beh. §35, OP. vispauzatis, El. wi.s.p.o.ca.ti.s,^' i.e.
vispa.huzyati, contracted and tetrasyllable. The place, which I believed
(in AMI vii,3i) to be Hecatompylos-Damghan, is called so because it
offers everything for good living; it lay in Par^ava towards Vrkana.
The OP. name would give NP. T>/gusfozaS, or—as spantadata > isfan

dropping of init. vi- and assimilation to sabzah “vegetables.”
The same explanation holds good for the n.pr. Hyspaosines, son of
Sagdodonacus, founder of Spasinou Charax, i.e. Muhammira on the
Shatt al-‘Arab, Pliny from Juba, who is also the source of
Pseudo-Lucian, Macrobii 16: “Hyspasines, king of Charax and the
regions on the Red Sea (= Persian Gulf), died of sickness at the age
of 85.” A clay tablet from Babylon, Landsberger in Z. Ass. n.f. vii,i 9335
298, records a decree of the administrator and the collegium of Esagila,
determining salaries for astronomers, dated 24.111.185, reign of Hyspao
sines. 185 Sel. is 128/7 B-cd* Hence, the king is exactly contemporary
with the founder of the Saka dynasty of Kirkuk, just after 129 b.c. The
name of the father sounds Babylonian: H. Winckler saw in it a Baby
lonian divine name plus -nadin.ahhe, and ASaSvaSivdxf]^ of Tello
Lagash has been identified with him. In spite of it, Hyspaosines might
be a Saka: another Iranian name of this dynasty is Tiraios, Aram. Tire,
short form of 'tigrahana, Tigranes “archer,’”" to whom the Sahr.Er.
ascribe the foundation of Nahr Tirak in Khuzistan. An older Hyspao
sines, a Bactrian, son of Mithroaxos < *mi0raha;}(s, appears in 180 b.c.
in an inscription from Delos.

The Palmyrenian inscriptions spell the placename ’spsn’. Andreas
(Lommel, in 711,4,302) explained Hyspaosines as ‘visponcono; Mark
wart, Sudarmenien 408,n.2 as Aw. uspansnu. It contains vispa, hu, and,
instead of zyata, the part.pres. zivan or ziyan, contracted zin, formation
like vispa.tarvan, hence: *vispa.hu.zm, vispauzin, meaning *
7rav-ev^io<;
or almost Polybios. In Spasinou Charax and ’spsn’, the init. vi- is
dropped as in Sabzaw^.
Among the five cities founded according to the Sahr.Er. §§19-20 by
Xusrau I, there is, beside Andev.Xusrau, the new town of Ctesiphon,
and beside Gehan.farraxv.kirt.Xusrau (cf. amt.ix,i49) the name
vsprxxvsLVB, visp.sat.;^usrau, not an entirely satisfying reading: it
should be, with insignificant change, vispozat-xusrau. These names
belong to the ostentatious official names, as used by Assyrians, Sasanians
and Arabs, in OP. so far only documented by the name of the gate of
Persepolis dvarffis visa.dahyus (= through which people of all prov
inces pass), and of the palace of Artaxerxes II at Susa, fivd’iy prdy
dam, formed with MP. pardeS, paradise, and pva-, to \^jya in hu.
jyati. Modern names like bay i Firdaus, Hast bihist, eight paradises,
express a similar thought. vispe.arya.rzura, “pan-Aryan forest,” name
of a race-course, represents this class in the Awesta.
The name of Ctesias’ river that carries manna is in the Photius text:
ivSiarrl "TTrapxo?, in the new Psellius text l,Trd^8apo<;, in Pliny, nh.
37, 39. Hypobarus, in Nonnus Hysporus. Ctesias’ translation is <j)ipwv
Trdvra rd dyadd, i.e. vispa.hu.bara; Ctesias himself wrote ‘‘TcrTrw^dpa?.
Another gloss of his is oi^apa<; = dya6dyyeko^, hence *vahyabara,
stem-word of Tahyabari > MP. vavar. The river is called so, because it
carries the manna, a tree raisin, crnrTa- or ^nrraxopa, yXvKv,
which drops into it as tears, SdKpva. All the names are correct, only
they are not tvSia-ri: Ctesias spoke Persian well, but not Indian, and
his Indika are Persian tales about India, that means the Indian prov
inces of the Persian empire.

that it was no longer a living name at the Muhammedan epoch, but
taken from Pahl. books, “aspan, horses” does not belong to the elements
entering in the formation of such “display-names,” and since the Pahl.

though the fall of vi- cannot be proved as a normal change of sound,
it is yet possible in “allegro forms” of long, artificial names of places

XXV. DEVA
“Und dein nicht zu achten, wie ich!”

Prometheus.
Nothing has been a greater obstruction to understanding the Awesta
than the wrong, preconceived notion of the word deva.
From the correspondence of Ved. deva, Lat. deus etc. and of Ved.
dyoh. Aw. dyos, Gr. Zeus etc., one has long since concluded that the
concept of the “heavenly ones” in opposition to the “earthly” homines,
and “mortal” mortales is Indo-European in general. Long since, too,
the analogies have been pointed out that exist between what Caesar
says about the Germanic gods {Bell. Gall.w,2i) sol, vulcanus, luna;
Herodotus about the Iranian ovpavoq, creXiijvT], yij, irvp, v8<op,
ave/toi; and what more recent authorities say about the Borussian sol,
luna, stellae, tonitura and terra. To these must be added, not less old,
the dawn, the lightning and others. Those are the “heavenly ones, deva,
dii” grouped around the “father Heaven” and the “mother Earth.”
Herodotus sees with Greek eyes. Where he relates history, he depends
more than we knew until recently on older logographs, first and fore
most Hecataeus, and he gathered his knowledge of the Iranian religion
in border provinces and from hearsay. His remarks about the temples
and altars, Zeus in heaven, Uranie-Mylitta, the feminine Mithra—none
of it correct—^prove that it was beyond his power to distinguish between
the Zoroastrism as revealed in the gathas and the popular religion of
his epoch. He wrote about 440 b.c.; about 400 b.c. the period of gathic
Zoroastrism had already passed. The religion was in transformation. So
far as such developments are conscious at all, they are not displayed, in
most cases what grows is unknown to the contemporaries, and what
has become is only perceivable to the later observer.
In Y/.io,i 45—under ‘Mithra’—a hymn begins with the invocation of
mi^ra-ahura, in dvandva form, and of stars, moon and sun; in the Veda,
the invocation of mitra-varuna is frequent; and in the political treaties
of the Mitanni Aryans, likewise, the gods of the oaths are invoked in
form of two dvandvas, the first being mitra-varuna. The reason the
names appear as dvandva is obviously that they were frequently invoked
together, and we may infer that the introductory formula of yr.10,145
was a fixed type already used at the Aryan period. Herodotus may



DEVA
370
have had knowledge of such a formula, and may have derived his
enumeration of Iranian gods from it, but hardly without combining
therewith the notion of the early Ionic philosophers, as e.g. 6 fjL^p ’EttI
Xa,p(jLO<s Tov? Oeovs elvai Xiyei dvifiov? vScop yrjv 'qXiov TTvp dcrrepa'i.
One must not call this “primitive worship of the elements”: in the
middle of the fifth century b.c. nothing can any longer be “primitive”
in Iran; that is a function of the state of civilization, and only “deca
dence” is possible/ One sees merely that the worship of the primeval
deva went on.
Bartholomae, Wb.66y: “daeva, im Gath. Bezeichnung der vor Zara
thustra in Iran geltenden Religion,” entirely right, and implying that,
before accepting the doctrine of Zoroaster, the Iranians were depa
yasna exactly as the Indo-Aryans. Wrong is: “Im Gath, gehdrt der
Begriff daeva in die gleiche Gruppe wie usig, kavi, karpan.” To usig
and karpan he remarks, Wb.^06 and 454, with identical words: “Be
zeichnung gewisser, der zarathustrischen Religion feindlicher Lehrer
und Priester.” They were not called so because they were hostile, but
had these names long before Zoroaster came. IT^.813 he describes
tkaesa and usig as “zu den Schlag- und Kampfwdrtern der zarathus
trischen Zeit gehorig.” There he goes definitely astray, and to go farther
on this way, and to translate, in the gatha, deva by “demon, idol = Gdtze,
devil = Teufel” is utterly absurd, cf. Hertel’s justified remarks in the
introduction to his translation of Y.32 in Beitr.2^1. It was equally
absurd, even when still believing in the post-Zoroastrian date of the
yashts, the so-called “Younger Awesta,” to give the word the exclusive
signification “gotze, idol”; for the possibility always existed that the
yashts contained old pieces in which deva can only mean “god.” The
deteriorated, untranslatable signification which one can only render
by MP. dev, is limited to the cases collected in Wb. (669, under ii,b) as
“namentlich bezeichnet.” With exception of the equally late passages
in Y/.8 and 18, they all come from the Videvdad, a product of the
Arsacid period, and even there the deva Indra, Naha^ya and Sarva of
F/i7. 19,43 last two also in 10,9) are to be excluded. Deva signifies
nothing but “heavenly ones, gods.” The passages where this sense is
really lost are worthless and could be entirely deleted.
^ Ubed in its vulgar sense, “primiti%e” in comparison with our own time, would be irrelevant and mispleading.



DEVA 371
The oldest Aryan gods attested by documents are the gods of the
oaths of the Mitanni people, the two dvandva Mitra-Varuna and Indra
Nasatya, well known from the Indian pantheon, while the Iranians
have lost the second pair—see under ‘Mithra.’ In the “list of gods,” in.
Rawl. 69, K.4343 n.5, furthermore “^Assara '^Mazas appears, i.e. Ar.
*asura maSdhasp the same list contains also Mi.it.ra. The Assyrian
scholars of the Assurbanipal library do not quote their sources, but the
pre-Iranian form proves that similar invocations of gods in Mitanni
treaties were the source. The worshippers of the god with the pre
Median name cannot have been Medes or magi, as Nyberg assumes:
already in 1913, H. Winckler wrote in mvag 18,4, 76: “Die Gottheiten
der Meder konnten nicht in einer solchen Liste Aufnahme gefunden
haben.”
Nyberg, 339: “Das Videvdad hat die deva Indra und Naha^ya,
mitanni Indra Nasatyas” ; the magi had “ursprvinglich dasselbe altarische
Pantheon wie die Arier von Mitanni,” and 364: “die Religion der
Meder war mit der der Mitanni wesentlich identisch.” Identity does
not suffer restrictions, and the Videvdad does not “have” the deva, it
mentions them only. The context is in 10,9: “Recite three times Y.
27,14, 33,11, 35,5, 53,9 and thereto I assault the deva Indra . . . the
Sarva . . . , the (sg.) Naha^ya!” §10,10 adds Tauri and Zarik (un
known). Then, “recite four times Y.27,13, 34,15, 545^ thereto I
assault esma . . . , akatas . . . , the Varunian deva, and vatiya!” This
stuff merely shows that its authors had not the faintest idea of what the
gatha 53,9 and other passages say.
19,43: “Ahriman does not know which way to talk, not know
which way to think: Zoroaster is born, what can one do about it?”,
words said in an assembly of the devs on the “wooded peak, arzurahya
pati kamrSam.”" Are present: Indra, Sarva, the (sg.) Naha^ya, Tarvi,
Zarik, Esma, Akatas, the Winter, Marsavan, Buti, Driwi, Kasvis,

meet again and meanwhile has a recess in hell. They do not even dance,
hke the witches on the Hexentanzplatz in the Harz. One can learn
nothing about Iranian religion from this witches’ sabbath.
Sarva and Naha^ya appear—as do the names hindus and harahvatis
—under Iranian not Indian form. But in the Veda, nasatya and dasra,
“undeceivable” and “miracle-working,” is a dual epithet of the two
Asvin, sons of Vivasvant (= Ir. Yama), and the nasatya of the Mitanni
Aryans are of course a pair; as names of each one of the twins the
words are used only considerably later. The form of the Videvdad, on
the contrary, is no dual, hence cannot come down from high antiquity,
and only from India, not from Mitanni. The acquaintance with the
Indian deva can at the most go back to the Achaemenian period, when
three Indian satrapies belonged to the empire. Soldiers’ songs, like that
of the deva-worshipping Vyamburadiva people—see under ‘Krsvar’

may have been the intermediary. The Mitanni episode came to an end
three hundred years before the first Mede appeared on Median soil.
What there was of somatic descendants of those Aryan “marianni”
had long since disappeared in the polyphylic mass of the Mesopotamian
population. They were lost as their language, and their religion—the
Aryan religion of the I5th-i4th centuries—could not be resurgent in
Media.
The foundation of the religion of all Aryan tribes, at the time of their
immigration in Iran, is one and the same, and developments lasting
500 years separated it from the point at which the Indo-Aryans and the
Mitanni-people had branched off. That is the situation as to descent.
It is a normal historical process for one or another god of a poly
theistic pantheon to obtain greater importance in certain regions. Dur
ing migrations, foreign gods, too, may be admitted. But Herodotus’
description fits entirely the Median religion which is not at all un
known.
The different songs to Mithra—^see under ‘Mithra’—collected in the
Mihr Yasht, belong to the Median epoch, have the Median empire as
their horizon, and show Mithra as one of the great Median gods. The
bagastana mountain, with the monument of Darius, was a Median
sanctuary of the baga Mithra, a mithraeum. There, holy white horses
from the near Nisaya stood saddled for the god to ride. In this case



DEVA 373
we can trace the sanctuary back to older periods. Ctesias attributes the
monument to Semiramis. The first Muslims called the mountain
“Tooth of Sumaira,” after a lady in Muhammad’s surroundings with
a prominent tooth. The joke was suggested by the original name of
the rock and its shape. Both are described in Sargon’s “eighth cam
paign”: “Simirria, uban sade, a ‘finger-tip mountain,’ sojourn of belit
ile, the Lady of the Gods, the top of which supports the heaven, the
root of which reaches the center of the netherworld.” The goddess is
the Cossaean “belit sade elluti, asibat reseti, lady of the snowy moun
tains, dwelling on the summits,” Sumalia or Simalia.
The worship of AhuraMazdah, in itself a matter of course, is proved
by the pre-Zoroastrian Median dvandva mi^ra-ahura and by names
like Masdaka of Andirpatianu = mod. DarwaS, of Aradpati, of Awakki
= mod. Awah, all true Medes, mentioned in Sargon’s list of Median
chiefs in prism A and the account of the eighth campaign. Masdaka is
the short form of a compound name with Mazdah, like Mazdayasna,
name of the father of a man in the memorial document of Y/.13. There
was, before Zoroaster, in Iran, as these Median names prove, in Media
as well as in Parsa (see below), a cult of Varuna, in which—a frequent
phenomenon in religion and legend—the appellative designation
AhuraMazdah, “the omniscient judge,” had replaced the proper name
Varuna-Uranos. The Ass. transcript ‘’Assara “Mazas shows that the
appellative itself goes farther back to the Aryan epoch.
The Awesta can scarcely have preserved much of the cult of this pre
Zoroastrian AhuraMazdah, but some fragments exist. Y/.13:

which Mazdah put on as his rai
ment,
adorned with stars, timbered in

of the halves of which beginning
and end are never seen!
“Wearing the heaven as raiment” means being the heaven; Mazdah is
Varuna, a notion which Zoroaster sanctioned in saying, Y.30,5: “the
most-holy manyu (mazdah) who is clothed in the most-solid heavens”
(see under ‘YamY). Another trace of Varuna-Mazdah is the description
of Atars, the Fire, as “pu^ra ahurahya mazda, son of A.M.” in the
myth of his fight for the hvarnah in the ocean, Yt.it), and similarly in
Y.59 and 62, see under ‘ApamNapat.’
An equally old song is preserved in Y.Haft.^S, the original metric
form of which still shines through at various places:
St.i: “imam at zam ganabis ha^ra yazamade ya na barati yasca
toi gana ahura mazda rtat haca, [we bring offerings to] this
earth here together with the women [that] bears us [and who
are] Thy Wives, AhuraMazdah [as Rtam] !”
“ya na barati” means the IE. earth as bar^ri, mother and support. The
“as Rtam” added to AhuraMazdah is meaningless, the usual Zoroas
trian adaptation of the older prayer.
St.3: “apo . .
. yazamade mekantisca hambavantisca fravazaho
ahuranis ahurahya huvapaho hupr^wasca hvayza^asca hus
na^rasca ubobyo ahubya cagma, the waters . . . the mingling,
uniting, forth-flowing ones, the ahura-wives of the ahura, the
fair-faced ones, good for fording, good for swimming, good
for bathing, a gift for both worlds!”
St.5: “apasca va azxsca va matrasca va agriya drigu.dayaho
vispa.pitis Wocama!, the waters as the pregnant, the mother
cows, the not-to-be-killed ones, the providers-of-the-poor, they
who water all (creatures), we invoke!”
It is no mere chance that the style of these verses is that of the Veda.
The notion of earth and waters as the wives of heaven, and fire as their



DEVA 375
son, is infinitely more archaic than Zoroaster’s AhuraMazdah, who, as
a manyu, has neither wives nor sons: lam yalad wa-lam yulid! The
Y.Haft. has preserved, in these verses, a prayer to the pre-Zoroastrian
Ahura-Varuna.
The two great Median fires, at Cecist in ASarbaijan and at Agbatana,
belonged to Vrthragna. They are the origin of the later concept and
name of the royal vahram-fires, see under ‘Chronology.’ The fire of
Shez was called aSar gusnasp, “of the stallion,” that of Agbatana aSar
kavatakan, “of the colt,” stallion and colt being—like the nar revant,
man of 30, and the youth of 15 years—incarnations of Vrthragna,
known from his yasht. He is the third of the great Median gods.
Berossus (in Agathias) calls him the Iranian Heracles, and his
special worship in Media and Armenia—countries united at an early
epoch—as Vahagn visapaqaj, Herakles drakontopniktes, of Agathan
gelos, may have a peculiar reason; the same dragon killer is represented
in western Asia Minor by ‘HpaKXe/nj?, in Etruria by Fercle, Osk. and
Lat. Hercle (voc, of "'Hpa/cXo?). As AhuraMazdah replaces the n.pr.
Varuna, so the epithet vr^ragna replaces the n.pr. Indra. No satisfying
etymology has been advanced for either the Greek name or the Aryan
epithet—to which also the adj. varaynahya (gen. of varagan) belongs
—and both may reflect, assimilated to Greek and to Aryan, the same
name of an Anatolic god.*
An inscription, discovered in 1822 by R. Ker Porter and better copied
by H. Rawlinson (jrgs x,ioo), in the caves of Karafto in the Zagros,
finally surveyed by Sir Aurel Stein in Old Routes of Western Asia,
1940, figs. 98-99, p.337f., says, according to M. N. Todd’s interpretation;

The editors put the inscription, for its paleography, “about 300 b.c.,”

Athena for Anahita “banok nam, whose name is lady.” On Iranian
soil, the Heracles inscription of Karaftb purports a hellenized sanctuary
of Vrthragna.
One attribute of Mithra, and yet more of Vrthragna, is hvarnah,
Tyche. It is an error to say that it “appears im ganzen wesdichen Iran
in der besonderen Form farnah” (Nyberg,342). Word and notion
“hvarnah” belong equally to all Iranian dialects, and farnah is not the
peculiar western form, see under ‘Hvarnah.’ In the worship of Vrth
ragna and his attribute the Medes differ no more from other Iranians
than in any other cultic things.
Herodotus reports that no sacrifice or prayer could take place with
out the presence of magi. If the magi—as Nyberg says—had had a reli
gion differing from that of the Medes, they would have celebrated,
every day, a cult that was not their own. “Der Zurvanismus war die
Religion der Magier vor Ankunft des Zoroastrismus,” which “ohne
Schatten eines Beweises” he fancies to have happened “spatestens in
Zusammenhang mit der Reichsgriindung der Achaemeniden.” While
the Median religion through all this time was “wesentlich mitannisch”
(396), “ist von da an die Religion der Magier wesentlich zoroastrisch,
Die Magier waren in tieferem Sinne keine Zoroastrier.” Then, not their
depth, but their surface would be their “essence.” Whatever the spiritual
movements were that passed behind the form of religion approved by
the state, and whatever the theories were that the magi projected into
it in the course of centuries—the class in whose hands always lay the
administration of the empire must have professed under Median rule
the Median, under Achaemenian rule the Achaemenian religion, and
so on.
Old Iranian, perhaps pre-Iranian and certainly pre-Zoroastrian, no
tions can be discerned in some of the mythic fragments dispersed
through various yashts. In yr.5,26 (in first pers.) and 19,32 (second
pers.)—text under ‘Yama xseta’—Yama prays “that I may surpass the
gods in riches and welfare!” Another meaning but “gods” is impossible
in this old myth. Equally in the next case.



DEVA 377
In the complex formula of the Hosyanha myth, as we have it, “mazan
ian deva and varun-ian drugvant,” deva gets a pejorative connotation by
being coupled with the Zoroastrian term drugvant; it did not have it
before. By adding drugvant, the original formula was adapted to Maz
daism, only after Zoroaster’s time when Hosyanha was put at the head
of the Iranian epopee. Yr.5,22 is the original, all other occurrences
are quotations of it, see under ‘Videvdad: Varuna.’
Alone, not as pair, varunya deva and mazanya deva appear only at
very inferior places, and merely the words “Grant me that I may slay
two thirds of the mazanian and varunian gods . . .” can be considered
as genuine. One can ponder much about this formula, for the Hosyanha
myth is unknown, perhaps a hyperbolic expression for “two thirds of
the Mazanians and Varunians (who worship foreign) gods,” or a
promethean motif of hybris, or, better; in this non-Iranian myth, which
originally belonged to Saka or Scolotian Scyths, a god fought hostile
gods. In later allusions to the legend, the varunya deva are described as
giants, see under ‘Videvdad.’ And Hellanicus says, in a scholion to
Hesiod’s Theogonia, v.139: “there are three kinds of cyclopes, first the
builders of the walls of Mycenae, second the Homeric savages, and
third the gods themselves, axnol oi Oeoi” In Theog. 502 the Cyclopes are
called OvpavtSai. From the same source the words of Aristeides Rhetor®
seem to come: Three kinds of Cyclopes: (i) those in the Odyssey, (2)
the = wall-builders ; (3) tovv Kakovfx,ivov<; ovpaviov^.
The varunya deva imagined as giants and the deal ovpdvioL or ovpav'Sai
as Cyclopes are the same notion: not more than a vague reminiscence
of them remained in Greece and in Iran. Somehow they were connected in pre-Aryan antiquity.
In YA19, th^ prayer—the shape in which all epic fragments appear in
the yasht—^has the formula
yat xsayata pati bumim hafta^iyam devanam martiyanamca
applied in st.26 to the paraSato Hosyanho, in 28 to ta^mo Rupis, in 31,
to Yamo x^cto, hence to the three first men and kings, who originally
belonged to separate cycles, but are at that place already brought into
the system which the Shahnamah still retains. The prayer is: “that I

In Y;.5 the form is

devanam martiyanamca provinces, over heavenly
ones, and mortals.
applied in 21 to Hdsyanha, in 25 to Yama, and moreover to the younger
figures kavi Usan and kavi Husravah, hence to two representatives of
the Median kavi dynasty, which is joined in that system, conform to
history, by the cycle of Vistaspa, protector of Zoroaster.
Y/.5 mentions several figures of this cycle. The prayer of Vikaspa,
the notarya himself, has become: “victory over the devayasna, deva-wor
shipping Prtana and Arjataspa”; that of the very hero of this cycle, his
brother Zarivaris-Zarer is: “victory over the deva-worshippers Huma
yaka and Arjataspa”; and the man, client, of the notarya, Visatarus, a
Persian, prays for “victory over the devayasna” in general. Of these fig
ures, Zarivaris and Visatarus, who appear in the memorial document,
are historical, the others mythical.
It does not matter, for our conclusions, whether the variants of the
formula are due to retouching done in Median or in Achaemenian times,
hafta^ya implies the notion of the seven krsvar, with Iran as center,
which is attested in the gathas, in still older parts of Y/.io, hence in the
sixth century b.c. and may be still older, upamam xsa^ram vispanam
dahyunam—see under ‘Mithra’ and ‘Social Structure’—is a term im
possible before the Median period: it has been transferred from the
kavi who bore this title to the kings of the older phase of the epics.
But devanam martiyanamca is a pre-Iranian, and beyond it, a pre
Aryan formula.
The appearance of Zoroaster was epoch-making also for the epic:
before him, the great Iranian heroes pray for ruling over deva and mor
tals, and the word deva has not the slightest bad taste or odor. They
do not want to catch Divs in bottles, like the fisherman in root Nights,
but the gods shall serve them. The idea is old-mythical, pre-Zoroastrian.
But after Zoroaster, the adversaries of the heroes are “deva-worshippers,”
what the heroes themselves are no longer, and that is something odious
and to be wiped out. The picture has completely changed.



DEVA 379
The epics reflect lucidly that it was Zoroaster who gave to the word
deva a changed moral value; what had been good is henceforth bad.
Therewith the descent of the word deva begins in Iranian. A similar
transvaluation came to pass in Greece at the same time, Xenophanes:
Ttavra deoL<s dvedrjKav “"O/iTjpo? 9’ 'HcrtoSd? re
ocrcra Trap dvOpcaTTOiaiv ovetSea Kal ipoyo^ icTTiv.
or;
d»9 7rXcio-T(a) i(^ 9iy^avTO deaiv dOepiana epya.
Nyberg, 193: “In dem Augenblick, da die [pre-Zoroastrian] Ahura
Religion bei den Iraniern die herrschende wurde, war der Ubergang
der daeva-Gottheiten zu daemonischen Wesen gegeben,” but on p.374
“verschwinden die daeva-Gdtter des altmedischen Pantheon ... in der
grossen Zahl der Daemonen” as a consequence of the infiltration of
post-Zoroastrian Zoroastrism from Raga into Media, w'hich took place
about the time of the foundation of the Achaemenid empire. The same
event happened at two different times.
Zoroaster did not “invent” AhuraMazdah, the god e.xisted, but a
special “Ahura-Religion” is disproved by the sole dvandva mi^ra-ahura.
The “transition” was not impersonally “given,” but Zoroaster gave the
impulse which led to the complete degeneration of the word deva in
Iranian. This is an inner-Iranian development, neither connected with
the pre-Iranian distinction between deva and ahura, heavenly ones and
lords, nor with the developments in India, where the deva remained
and the pre-Indian asura came into disrepute. Indra, Varuna and the
Aditya are asura in India, and their decline begins with the time of the
tenth book of the Rgveda and the Atharvaveda, and ends in making
them enemies of the deva. It was an error, emanating from Martin
Haug and almost generally accepted, to consider this coincidental and
not simultaneous contrariness of movements as something causally con
nected, and as an “Indo-Iranian schism.”
Zoroaster offers to the w'hole world including the gods—not the
devils—the “choice” of accepting his monotheism. It is he himself who
decides which deva choose right, by admitting some of them into the
many-sided figure of his AhuraMazdah. This only god is a multiplicity,
a precursor of the Christian Trinity. From the time of the Yasna
Haftahati onwards, these partial figures are called “amrta spanta.



DEVA
380
immortal-holy ones,” and since spanta, to V su-, is a power producing
welfare, probably in the sense of powers, Suva/itets. They are often
mentioned beside AhuraMazdah, where human qualities are attributed
to him: he hears, talks, acts through them. They are also meant by the
plural Mazda ahuraho in y.314 and 30,9.
To put an abstract conception between god and men is something
resembling—probably caused by similar reflections—the memra-Xdyos
sermo and ru^h-spiritus in the OT. Apart from the case where they are
directly invoked, the names of the partial figures or aspects appear in
the instrumental, which is usually interpreted as comitative, even as
substitute for the nominative. This interpretation not only encumbers
the translations of the Gathic verses to a degree that to understand them
one must skip the “comitatives,” but it makes nowhere real sense and
makes many verses incomprehensible. The god sees, hears and acts
“through,” not “with” these figures, the case is always just as instru
mental, as e.g. in y.32,2 where he speaks “xsa^rat haca, by (the mouth
of) xsa^ram,” cf. rtat haca in the Ahunavarya. The only right trans
lation is “in the quality of, as.” Markwart, Gath.ult., used this in the
passage “als er (the spanta) mich umschritt mit (oder ‘als’) Gute
Gesinnung”; on p.66 he called the case “Instrumental der Eigenschaft,”
evidently so in the Ahunavarya. In y.43,6 any other translation is im
possible, the comitative “with” results in a complete misunderstanding:
“at which turn, rvesa, [the last one, of the judgment] Thou wilt come
as spanta manyu, vahu manaha (armatis, xratus),” i.e. in all your
aspects simultaneously and moreover as—not with—^yourself as spanta
manyu. In y.47,6, too—see under ‘Last Judgment’—AhuraMazdah
appears “as Spantamanyus.”
The idea is Zoroaster’s and continues in Christianity. Dante, Inf.
niy4ff.. Giustizia mosse il mio alto fattore,
fecemi la divina Potestate,
la somma Sapienzia e il primo Amore.
One easily recognizes Mazdah’s xratus, spanto manyus and vahumano.
Which partial figures are named at the different places in this “instru
mental of quality” depends on the context: rta for things judicial,
armati for social, agricultural, xsa^ra for political, vahumanah for moral
subjects. Invocation of more than one means emphasis, thus in y49,7,



DEVA 381
when talking of the decision of the coint of appeal, most momentous
for Zoroaster’s life; “AhuraMazdah shall hear as Vahumano, shall
hear as Rtam, hear it yourself, AhuraMazdah!” Whether the partial
figures are invoked alone or together with the god, whether they act
alone or with him—also where he himself is not called, in all cases the
monotheos is meant in his aspects.
These aspects result from the transformation of a polytheistic pan
theon into a monotheistic conception, and are Zoroaster’s most original
and most personal thought. To call them “Gotter und Gotterreihen”
is the way Muhammad thought of the Christian Trinity and the mush
tarikin. In doing so one cuts off the thread leading from this multi
plicity to the Trinity, and therewith the possibility of comprehending,
historically, the idea of the Spiritus Sanctus.
The great gods of the polytheistic pantheon that Zoroaster excludes
by “choosing the evil,” became “evil gods.”
y.30,5: “those who by conduct as it should be are voluntarily obedient
to AhuraMazdah, have chosen, varta, to work the Rtam, rtam vrzya
like the most-holy spirit.” And Y.30,3: “the hudaho noit duzdaho chose
right rs visyata between the two (good and evil),” see under ‘Yama.’
y.30.6:
aya noit rs visyata devacana yat is adboma
prsamnan upajasat yat vrnata acikam mano
at esmam handvaranta ya banayan ahum mrtano
“Between these two (good and evil) the gods, too, did not choose right,
since the deceiver came upon them when interrogated, so that they
chose for themselves the wholly evil spirit; then they all ran to esmo,
through which they corrupt the life for men !”
The “evil gods” stand outside of Zoroaster’s dualism of good and
evil; they do not belong to his system and exist only because they existed
before. It is significant for the period that Zoroaster condemns them,
but does not deny their existence. The Akk. version of Xerx. Pers. daiv.
correctly renders the peculiar notion by “limnu'", the evil ones (gods),”
a translation very Babylonian in omitting ilani, because “evil” is no
attribute applicable to a Babylonian god; they distinguish between good
and bad demons, and their ilu limnu. Sum. dingir.hul is a demon of
the dead from the netherworld. Hesychios has preserved the gloss:



DEVA
382
Aeua? • rot>? Ka/cous 6eov<i, ^dyoi, cf. Lagarde, Abhdlg. 148, entirely
apart from the Sat/roi^es ’'ilfiavos— ahumano and ’Apet/xai^to?.
esma, Gr. olyua, Lat. ira, is, in Zoroaster’s phraseology not “der Name
eines deva” (Wb.) but a moral idea, like good and evil, drugvadbis
esmam in ¥.29,2 is not “esma together with the drugvant,” but—instr.
of quality—“esma as (collective of) the drugvant,” and is the same as
aka manyus and the dru^s. In as late a book as the Videvdad, where
Ahriman has become the devan dev, esma is personified as hesm dev,
the Asmodaeus of the book of Tobit.^
In the late passages where “the deva” appear in plural, the notion is
undefined; where they are “called by name,” they are bad passions,
sicknesses, great cold, and occasionally the above-mentioned Indian
gods are added to them. But nowhere does the name of one of the
ancient gods appear among them. That cannot be, because the old deva
did not “disappear in the great number of demons,” but had again
become the “great gods.” Those which Zoroaster made to choose evil,
ceded their title to the later devs. The place of the devs is hell; that
deva meant “heavenly” was no longer understood. In Zoroaster’s doc
trine the “evil gods” do not act at all as aspects of the Evil Spirit. They
are a dynasty dethroned, but soon restored. Only after their restoration,
after the word deva had been separated from its old bearers, and after
these gods had come back under another generic name, the further
degeneration of the word to “demon, devil” could set in.
Who worships Mazdah—as Darius and Xerxes say of themselves,
mazdam yazate—is an adherent of Zoroaster; who worships the deva,
devan yazate—the divine enemies of his god—is his enemy. That is
the origin of the later terms mazdayasna and devayasna both of which
imply, as mutual negation, their antonym ex definitione, and which,
like rtavan and drugvant, are meaningless without the Zoroastrian
dualism of Good and Evil. Vid.i?> forms even the negation a.devayasna,
meaning mazdayasna.
That gods were worshipped before Zoroaster is a matter of course,
and “worshipper of gods” cannot have furnished the name for the
In the late tale of Zoroaster’s temptation Ahriman says: “Zoroaster, you are Purusaspa’s son, from (your; birth za\isi,“ whatever the conupt za\isi means, but if Ahriman prefers with these words a claim to worship, he seems to identify himself collectively with the de\a worshipped b> Zoroaster's ancestors.



DEVA 383
adherents of the pre-Zoroastrian religion. The adherence of a peculiar
group to the pre-Zoroastrian AhuraMazdah would hardly have been
expressed by mazdayasna, rather by mazdaka. MaMaku appears several
times in the Assyrian annals as n.pr. of Medes, and Mazdayasna in the
memorial document of Y/.13, likewise as a proper name. If in that list
an adult with patronym is enumerated, but not his father, the father
belongs of necessity to the generation that preceded the “coming of the
religion,” and this Mazdayasna was no Zoroastrian. But as designation
of religious groups of adherents and adversaries of his religion both
words can have been used only after Zoroaster. As an appellative, maz
dayasna is not attested earlier than devayasna; both appear just before
the syncretistic redaction of the Awesta under Artaxerxes II, see under
‘Fravarani.’ Therefore, the terms imply a date: where they are not used,
one is close to Zoroaster’s own time.
It cannot be otherwise, Zoroaster must talk in terms of generally
accepted meaning when speaking to people whom he wants to con
vince. He does so, e.g. in Y.46,5 using the antique moral notions razan,
rvati and mi^ra, see under ‘Mithra.’ The term deva, too, can have in
the gathas no other meaning than in the old epic passages in the yashts:
heavenly ones, gods. Zoroaster is still declaiming against them, “devil”
or “Gotze” (Andreas-Lommel) is just as impossible as “daemonische
Wesen” (Nyberg). The example of Y.324—text under ‘Yama xseta’
makes that very clear: “For you tell fables of wholly evil deeds for
which men doing them are called deva.zusta . . . while they sin against
AhuraMazdah’s will ”
Although their acts are sins against Rtam, the heroes of the epics are
glorified—of course not as “minions of the devil”—but as deva.zusta,
01. deva.justa, ovtiv av <^1X77 de6<;, “beloved by the gods.” The word
has not the slightest tinge of depreciation.
Likewise, in the myth of Yama—see under ‘Yama xseta’—the hero
does not want to surpass the devils, but the gods. Nyberg writes: “Die
daeva-Gdtter, in der Regel lauter heroische Gotter, waren in diesem
Kreise von unkriegerischen Hirten [at another place: gewaltige Krie
ger] abgestossen worden oder batten jedenfalls alien Boden unter den
Fiissen verloren.” So the gods float in air, as do the following contradic
tory definitions: 193: “Man braucht nickt uber die iranisehe Welt
hinauszugehen, um die daeva zu identificieren,” and 365 : “Gilt es den

384
Ursprung des Ausdrucks zu bestimmen, so muss man zunachst beden
ken, dass bier nichtiranische Cotter gemeint sind.” No wonder that he
never calls their names.
Deva are all those whose names Zoroaster strictly avoids calling by
name—as strictly as do the inscriptions of Darius and Xerxes—namely
Mithra, Vrthragna, Anahita and all great rivals of his one Ahura
Mazdah. Nyberg regards them as members of the pantheon of the
“Zoroastrian Urgemeinde,” probably “admitted by Zoroaster himself,”
but another reason than the prophets’ absolute silence cannot be ad
duced.
An Arab hadith tells:® “Two men asked ‘A’isha, the Mother of the
Faithful, who it was that had been with Muhammad at a certain occa
sion and she replied: Two, the other was nn! Afterwards, one of the
interviewers said to the other: How strange, who, then, was the other
one? and got the answer: Don’t you know, Ali of course; if she speaks
of somebody without a name, it is always Ali.” Such silence is hatred
and contempt. J. Levy says in his article on the Xerxes inscription. Rev.
Hist. 85, 1939: “Taire le nom d’un ennemi mepris est un fait bien connu
dans I’antiquite semitique,” quoting Isa. vii,5 and 9, on Pekah of Israel
and Nebukadnezar on Nekao, the “rebel satrap.” In a book of modern
explorations in Armenia, one of the partners describes the other as
“whose near-sighted eyes had the effect of a magnifying lens at short
distance,” but does not reveal his well-known name. That is the curse
of the effaced memory: Heine’s “Nicht gedacht soil seiner werden!”
So hates Zoroaster.
Y.32 is his promethean “song against the Deva.” It begins: “If gods
and men would place themselves at AhuraMazdah’s command!” They
do not; so he goes on, st.3: “You deva all and who worship you, are the
brood of akam mano, of the druxs and of parimatis !” Yet severer he
says in Y.34,5: “para . . . vispais vavaxma devaisca harfstrais marti
yaisca, we have severed ourselves from [= abjure] all vipers whether
gods or men! That is 2x>roaster’s “naismi devo, I challenge the gods!”
and IS the origin of the condemnation of the gods in the younger fra
varani: “just as Zoroaster severed himself from the gods!”
* ZDMC, 38, pp.388-92.



DEVA 385
deva appears at many places, and nowhere is the signification other
wise. One place is difficult, Y.49, which begins with the stanzas on
bandva and his tkesa; st.4: “Who by bad-will increase esma and rama
with their tongues, as false shepherds among shepherds, whose good
deeds do not annul the bad deeds,
toi devan dan ya drugvato dena!
Andreas-Lommel : “die schaffen (erzeugen) Teufel durch die
Lehre (entsprechend dem Gesetz) des Liigners,” which would
make come true Luther’s “und wenn die Welt voll Teufel war!”

Bartholomae: “in der daeva Haus mit ihnen! (ins Haus)
fiir die daena der drugvant!”
Bartholomae’s interpretation of the elliptical construction
is supported by the analogous end of the following stanza:
“mit denen—in Dein Reich !” But the case of dan, loc.sg. of dam
according to Wb. and Grdr. §§303, 403, is undefinable; devan
cannot enter for the gen.pL, and ya drugvato dena is doubtful
as to its construction. Both translations are unsatisfactory. The
purport must be : “To hell with them!”
One point seems to be sure, this gatha verse is the origin of Xerxes’
devadanam in Pers-daiv.^"]. My attempt in Altp.lnschr.x'yi to explain
it as a contemptuous expression alluding to “house of gods,” something
like “den of the devs”—MP. says “nisem e uzdescarih, nest of idol
worship”—^has found unexpected approval.® The transmission of the
text of 49,4 is hardly accurate; one solution would be to restore a com
pound of devan -j- dan, perhaps with a verse of 5 -T 6 instead of
4 + 7 syllables. The last words are probably a vocative: “you soul of a
sinner!”
The first change in the Zoroastrian terms can be noticed in the
Yasna haftahati, which, though written in the dialect of the gathas,
is post-Zoroastrian, and remarkably poor of contents. There, for the
first time, a “community” appears with priests called a^ravan, and the
beginning of a theology that makes a system of the aspects of Ahura
Mazdah as Amrta Spanta; Zoroaster himself is invoked. According
to Nyberg, for the first time in the history of Zoroastrism, a word cor
^ dana, second element of compounds, IE. *dhana, Gr. theke; cf. Aw, uz.dana, MP. astod^, container," in Arab, bait, house, corresponds.



DEVA
386
responding to our god, entirely absent from the gathas, would appear
there, namely “yazata, anbetungswert, to be worshipped, adorable.”
In Mithra’s Questions, Yr.io,io8, we read
ko huyasti ko duzyasti who believes me to be one
to be worshipped
mam zi manyate yazatam with bad, who with good of
ferings
and in the ApamNapat hymn, Y/.i9,52:
yo upa.apo yazato the yazata dwelling in the
water,
srut.gosatamo yazamno the best-hearing when offer
ings are made to him!
Both passages—see under ‘Mithra’ and 'ApamNapat’—are pre-Zoroas
trian. The Yasna haftahati is post-Zoroastrian. The assertion falls with
the wrong assumption that the Y.hajt., composed in Gathic, ought
therefore to be older than the yashts, composed in Awestic. The word
yazata, a regular verbal adj. of Vyaz-, of course, existed in the old
language.
Zoroaster had three words at his disposal, all exactly corresponding to
our god; “ahura, lord, deva, heavenly, and baga, he who allots fate.”
The last one, baga is, in Iran and India, the epithet of Mithra and of
Mah (Yr.7,5). Mithra’s great festival was the bagayadis in his month
mi^rakana, a place of his was Bagastana, in Y/.io,i4i he is called
“baganam as.xra^wastamo”; in the “Questions” he asks “kahmai . . .
azam baxsani xsayamno.?” Baga is O.Sl. bog, hence a pre-Aryan word,
and cannot have remained unknown to Zoroaster, but its connection
with Mithra^” may have caused his dislike. He uses ahura for his god,
when speaking of his aspects also in the plural; deva for the old gods
of polytheism which he condemns. There is no occasion for a third
word, for he never speaks of other gods or groups of gods.
Since he fights the deva and their worshippers, the official recogni
Henning, jr.^s 1944, i34f-: “The assumpuon that baga had the value of another name for Mithra is unsupported by any evidence as far as western Iran is concerned; in a limited sen^ it can be admitted only for Sogdiana and Khwarezm in late Achacmenian times.” Note: “At the time of the introduction of the ‘Young Awestan’ calendar in those provinces.” There IS no distinction between an eastern and a western Mithra. Soghd. ba7akan: Mihrmah, and Xvar. bi7: Mihr.roz are instances of the normal use of baga for Mithra, see Yr.io,io and 141 under ‘Mithra,’ and the song “kahmai . . . azam baxsani Mithra’s Questions.

tion of his doctrine made this word unfit to be used for gods that are to
be worshipped. It is the most natural thing that those allowed to be wor
shipped were henceforth called “yazata, adorandi, to-be-worshipped
ones,” with the attribute that existed before. Thus yazata became the
new generic name under which the old prohibited deva came back into
the post-Zoroastrian religion. Like the terms mazdayasna and deva
yasna, yazata implies a date: where it is missing, as in the OP. inscrip
tions, one is still close to Zoroaster’s own time.
Y.49,3 is the genuine creed of Zoroaster, from which the fravarani of
Y.12 issued—see under ‘Fravarani.’ The paraphrase shows the trans
formation of the thoughts which came to pass since the time of the
gathas. The interval cannot have been a short one, Awestic had mean
while become a dead language.
In this younger fravarani, we find the terms mazdayasno, zara^ustris,
videvo, ahuratkeso, or four sides of the same idea: worshipper of Maz
dah, Zoroastrian, adversary of the deva, follower of AhuraMazdah’s
commandments. Y.12,4; “vi mruve saram = interdico connubium, I
renounce the community with the deva, the bad, aya, those without
Vahumano, a.vahu, without-Rtam, an.rta, that work evil, aka.da . . .
the wholly-drug-ish, dro)ista, wholly-stinking, posika, gods, deva!”
These gods are still those that have rejected AhuraMazdah, but they
are already gods of the past, the notion is dimmed, vi.mruve, like antar.
mruve in Y.49,3, is “interdico,” equivalent to para-vavaxma in Y.34,5.
The adj. aya alludes to akat manaho ci^ram in Y.32,3.
Because they did not choose Vahumano, they are called a.vahu, i.e.
a.vahumanah, with the same shortening as in daraya.vahu for ‘^daraya.
vahumanah. Likewise an.rta, because they are without rtam. Together
with Gath. zita.rta, this an.rta proves that those who confess said rta,
not asa. aka.da—syn. of duzda and opp. to hu.da in Y.30,3—means the
“Kraft—die stets das Bose will.”

to eliminate, with Benveniste, the apposition vacam aha^yam.
This sentence is preceded by para an.adruxtoit, Pahl.transl.
a.drozisnih, Bartholomae: “vor dem dass er log.” Yama’s fall
is caused by trespassing a taboo of food, and is no more a “he”
than Adam and Eve’s fall, when they allowed themselves to be
tempted.
Beh. §54: droga.di[s hami^h]ya akunos tya ime karam
adruzyasa, must be translated; “Dr5ga made them disloyal, by
making those [the false pretenders] seduce [lit. make drug-ish]
the army.” OP. adruzyasa is denominative and corresponds
to the Aw. n.abstr. adruxti. para an.adruxtoit means “before
his (not) being tempted.” OP. droga, m. [OP. notation for 0 is
*u]. Aw. droga in Vid., and Gath, drug- f., are identical. And
drojika is the superl. to the pos. Aw. drdjina [in drojina.brta
Parr.22], OP. drojana, drozana.^^ The superl. drojista corre
sponds to the OP. pos. martiya drozana. Zoroaster calls the
same notion drugvant, but it is OP. drozana, not drugvant, that
survives as drozan in MP,^’'
On p.273 Nyberg speaks about drdjista, but not on p.361,
where he asserts: “keine Stelle [of the OP. inscriptions] reicht
aus um zu beweisen, dass drauga, draujana altzoroastrische,
dem Osten gehdrige Begriffe waren.” Furthermore “Umsetzung
in andre Dialekte kommt nicht vor” and “Wer wie die Perser
yaS- statt yaz- sagte ist kein Zoroastrier.”
In Mas^i\ al-absdr, 262, the poet al-Manbidji tells of a night
he spent in the monastery of Dair al-Baghuth, and of a monk
there who spoke excellent Arabic, but had a lisp and pro
nounced s like 6. When the monk asked the poet the following
morning for a few verses as remembrance, al-Manbidji made
a poem rhyming in -u^, -Id, suggested by the name bayu^ and
the lisping of the monk, it begins:
The Aw. archetype did not note any short vowel after palatal; Awestic script notes usually a, which Bartholomae replaced by i. This may well have been tlic pronunciation since the 6th century b.c. OP. has one sign c* = ci, derived from Sem. si; it writes a s p c“ n, Gr. As
pathines, hence c^ without i pronounced ci. The descent of the two signs Ja and is not yet clear to me. *2 c.g. Art.Vir.Nam. V: “gas e rastan u gas c drdzanan, the place of the just and the wicked.”

Could a Persian with a lisp not be a Zoroastrian ? A prohibition
issued today to the effect that the old Persians, as Zoroastrians,
were not allowed to pray in their own dialect, has no binding
power.
In Y.43,8 Zoroaster says, in his vision, as first word to AhuraMazdah
“a true hater I will be of the drugvant,” of the gods and men who
chose the Drug; and Darius says at the beginning of his tomb-inscrip
tion “of the martiya drozana I am a hater.” drugvant = drozana, with
their antonym rtavan, have no sense and are impossible unless they
refer to the dualism of good and evil in Zoroaster’s moral doctrine.
Before him there were only mi^radruxs—see under ‘Mithra.’ Without
Zoroaster, there can be no drozana, and this word alone proves that
the Achaemenids were Zoroastrians, just as it is proved by their sole
worship of Oramazda, their belief in the dualism of good and evil,
the resurrection and the reward at the last judgment, drojista, the
superl. of drozana, is used in the Fravarani: the fravarani is late, and
OP. drozana is much older than this creed.
posista is chosen for the rhyme, counterpart to OP. gasta. The home
of Ahramanyus, ahrai vari of the Ogmadeca, is called duzganti in the
Had.N., Aw. ganti “stench,” adj. OP. gasta. Later, Ahramanyus is
written with the logogram anra‘‘.menu‘", which Nyberg interpreted as
gannak-menuk, stinking spirit.” But he says 36: “Wenn die Altp. In
schriften gasta, eigentlich ‘iibelriechend,’ fiir das Bose verwenden . . .
,
so befinden wir uns ausserhalb des Bereiches des Zoroastrismus.” This
judgment would eliminate simultaneously the HaSoxt Nask. “Gewiss
1st auch im Awesta das Bose iibelriechend, aber dafiir wird ein ganz
andres Wort gebraucht.” This word, not mentioned, is posista, the
rhyme word of drojista. The criterion, to distinguish religions from
the different odor of their unholiness, is new. Only, they do not differ:
Aw. duz.ganti and OP. gasta are both gand-, hydric sulphide, so per
manent that we connect the imagination of the devil with smell of
brimstone to the present day.

Y.12,6: “As Zoroaster renounced the community with the gods,
devais saram vyamruvita, thus I renounce, as Mazdayasnian and Zoro
astrian, the community with the gods, deva.” One cannot say more
clearly that renouncing the devayasnian polytheism means embracing
mazdayasnian monotheism.
St.7: “I choose like the waters and plants, apa-urvare, the cow that
gives-what-is-good, gaus hu.da, like AhuraMazdah, yo gam dada, yo
naram rtavanam dada etc.”
The sunnite term “as AhuraMazdah chose” indicates, again, the late
time of the composition. To this peculiar concept, evidently, the Mu
hammedan orthodox doctrine is related. The caliph al-Mutawakkil
says in his proclamation, directed against the ahl al-dhimma, with a
point against the mu‘tazila, Tabari 111,1380: “Allah, the blessed, the
exalted, in His majesty without limits and His power over anything
He wills, has chosen Islam for Himself, and approved it, favored His
angels therewith, sent His envoys with it, helped His saints with it
etc.” And 111,1392: “the religion which Allah has chosen for the mus
lims.” The doctrine involves the other one of the Qur’an not being
created, but eternally existent as a quality of Allah, a doctrine not un
connected with St. John’s kv apxrj ‘^v 6 Xdyo?, sermo, or memra as
mediator and hypostasis. Not long before, the caliph al-Ma’mum wrote
in a letter to Ishaq b. Ibrahim, the confidant of al-Mu‘tasim, in Taifuri s
/{itdb Baghdad, fol. i3or
“Apart from Allah, all and everything is a work of His creation
and a product of which He is the author. Although the Qur’an ex
presses and explains it, precluding any doubt, one has compared with
it what the Christians assert about Jesus, the son of Miryam: He is not
created, since he is the Word of God. But Allah says: Verily, We have
set it as an Arabic Qur’an (43,2), what clearly means nothing but:
We have created, etc.”
Thus, three religions have been under the strange spell of the same
thought, and passionate about it. But hardly has a truer remark ever
been made about this and similar disputes, than that by the great poet
abu l-‘Atahiya, Kit. al-Aghdni 3,129: “Shu‘aib, the friend of abu Du’ad,
qadi al-qudat of al-Mu‘tasim, told: I said to abu l-'Atahiya: Do you
believe the Qur’an to be created or not created? He said: Whom do
you mean, Allah or somebody else? And I talked and talked to him



DEVA 391
and polemized against him, and he always replied with the same
quesdon. Finally I said: What is the matter with you, don’t you want
to answer ? and he said : I have answered, but you are an ass !”
The formula “AhuraMazdah yo gam dada yo naram rtavanam
dada, who has created the cow, the orthodox man etc.” is modeled after
Y.44,3 and 51,7 (see under ‘Harvatat’). AhuraMazdah has also created
the non-orthodox; the verse means He created man and gave him the
possibility of becoming rtavan. The expression is clumsy and late, unless
rtavan be an added gloss. In Zoroaster’s verses on the creation, Y.44,
under ‘Yama,’ in every stanza, between the creation of earthly things,
the questions are inserted: “Who is the creator of Rtam, who of Vahu
mano.?” The prayer of Darius, in all his great inscription and repeated
by Xerxes and Artaxerxes I, but no more by Artaxerxes II, says : “baga vazraka oramazda hya imam bumim ada, hya avam asmanam ada, hya
martiyam ada, hya syatim ada martiyahya,” hence, speaks of earth,
heaven, men and the n.abstr. syatis. As Zoroaster inserts rtam and
vahumano between the worldly objects, thus Darius puts in syads, the
Fravarani rtavan. But Darius’ prayer expresses the deficient thought
of the fravarani in clear words : “who created syatis for men,” in order
to become syata. Xerxes daiv. Il47f. says: “syata ahani ziva, mrta rtava
ahani, syata I want to be in life, in death rtava.” The El. version
transcribes the untranslatable term by sa.t.ta = sata. The wish is the same
as Zoroaster’s dadi moi amrtata harvata in Y.51,7, “blessed life here and
eternal life.” OP. syatis, Lat. quies, peace, and syata “peaceful”—like Aw.
noit kudat-sati, “else-without-peace” in Vid.\—describe the blissful con
dition, happiness resulting from a religious life. The opposite is Aw.
pati.rtaye, being-contested, opposed, MP. patiyarakih, opposition of the
patiyarak, fiend. MP. apatiy^akih is the negative expression of OP.
syatis, being-uncontested, in peace,” Aw. a.pati.rta neg. expression of
syata. The oriental notion of bliss is rather primitive: quietism, kef,
freedom from activity, syata, harvatat, is the earthly correspondent,
getik, of the menok, heavenly rtavan, amrtatat. The two words are com
plementary like Gr. oXySios and fiaKdpio<s. By creating rtam, vahu
mano, syatis and rtavan, AhuraMazdah has made it possible for men
to reach this bliss.
The ApamNapat hymn in Y/.i9,52, see under ‘ApamNapat,’ reveals



DEVA
392
an entirely different and much older concept of creation and no trace
of the Zoroastrian notions: “the yazata, dwelling in the waters, the
Xsa^riya = ra^estar, with the speedy horses, the male, ApamNapat,
created the men, nar.”
Xerxes’ prayer and promise, “syata in life, rtava in death,” contains
the notion of reward in this and future life for the acts of men. This
idea is not only foreign to, but impossible in pre-Zoroastrian polytheism
which knew only of a “life in silence, tusnisad.” The idea of religion
as the relation of the individual man to the universal god was not yet
born.^^ Wherever AhuraMazdah is invoked as sole creator, as he who
determined (Y.43,5) the return for good and bad acts, as in the true
Fravarani Y.49,3 and in Darius’ prayer, we are facing Zoroaster’s doc
trine.
Nyberg calls (349) Darius’ prayer “frei von religidsem Pathos” while
it is “frei von religiosen Phrasen,” and “eine Formel medischen Ur
sprungs,” reason: the OP. word for “great” vazraka, is a Median loan
word; baga is common to both dialects, vazraka was borrowed in the
protocol formula “xsaya^ya vazraka,” and if the Persians pronounced
“great” in “great-king” with a z, they did not pronounce it with 8 in
“great god.” This and similar ubiquitous arguments are utterly futile.
The three OIr. words for “god,” ahura, deva and baga, are all at
tested in OP. dialect. The inscriptions agree with the gathas in using
ora < ahura only in the name of the god. The deva in Xerxes’ inscrip
tion are the “evil gods,” Akk. limnu, whose cult the king prohibits,
again conform to the gathic style. Everywhere else, OP. uses baga.
Except in the Median formula “baga vazraka, a great god (is Ora
mazda),” OP. baga always implies the notion of non-Iranian gods
beside the Iranian ahura and deva.^^ This is plainly expressed in “uta
anyaha bagaha tye hanti, and the other (or alien) gods that are” beside
Oramazda, the “god of the Aryans”; likewise in “hada visebis bagebis,
Oramazda along with all gods.” Zoroaster, whose gathas only speak of
the struggle of his AhuraMazdah with the Iranian deva, never has the
gods of Elam, Babylon and other foreign countries in mind; the great
kings always, for they write in three languages and rule over many
Cf. the remarks on Ed. Meyer, Christent. 11,17, at the end of chapt. ‘Chronology.’ For the various formulae with baga see Altpjnschr. s.v., and cf. 10,141; Y.io,io, 70,1.



DEVA 393
non-Aryan nations with “other gods.” Since nobody can be ahura beside
“the lord justiciary who judges, viciro ahuro” (Y.294), the “just lord
justiciary, spanta ahura rtavan” (Y.46,9), and since the deva are ban
ished, baga alone is left for a wider application. As in the gathas, yazata
is not yet used.
anya, = alius, alienus in OP., can have the acceptation “hostile,” in
analogy to alien and enemy; for Awestic cf. Y/.io,28: “upa anya scinda
yati, he destroys the enemies” and anya.tkesa, anya.varna, heterodox,
heretic. The anyaha bag^a are “alii dii” or “dii alieni.” Nyberg, 354:
“Sind also diese Gdtter Jahwe, Marduk u.a. gemeint.^ Gewiss nicht. . . .
Wer damit gemeint ist, wird deutlich mit dem Ausdruck vi^a baga
‘Clan-Gotter’ bezeichnet. Es sind die Gottheiten der Ahnen und Epony
men des Hauses etc. Wie hienieden der Grosskonig sich iiber seinen
Hofstaat erhebt, so erhebt sich in der himmlischen Welt AhuraMazdah
iiber einen Hofstaat der himmlischen Vertreter der verschiedenen
Geschlechter. . . . Bezeichnend, dass Darius den Ausdruck ‘der grosste
der baga’ nur da gebraucht, wo er sich an seine Landsleute wendet, die
Arier der Persis.” Also 375: “Kein prophetischer Geist hat (der Reli
gion der Achaemeniden) ihr Geprage gegeben, sie ist geschaffen von
Grosskonigen fiir Grosskonige, und AhuraMazdah erhebt sich in ein
samer Majestat iiber einem Hofstaat von Clan-gottern, deren Namen
man nicht einmal zu nennen fiir notig halt.”
Weissbach, in his edition, had never trusted Westergaard’s reading
“vWa baga.?”, and I had reported in ami vi, 1933,74, years before
Nyberg’s lecture, that the reading is an error, thrice repeated, for the
usual formula “hada visebis bagebis, along with all gods.” The lonely
majesty, the households, and with them the unimaginable consequences
of this accumulation in heaven could have been avoided. But the asser
tion that ma^ista baganam was used only where the king speaks to
his countrymen does not depend on this false reading; 350: “Der Ton
fall wird immer intimer . . . wenn er zu seinem eigenen Stammland,
der Persis, spricht: . . . nebst den Clan-gottern, viffa baga.”
ma^ista baganam appears on the gold-tablets from Agbatana
(Media) and Persepolis; in Pers.d; in Pers.g (only Akk. text) as sa rabu
ina muhhi ilani; and in Xerx. Van (Armenia). The gold-tablets lay
invisible in air-tight stone-boxes under the foundations; the visible
inscription in Van was no more legible to the Armenians there, just



394 DEVA
as incomprehensible as the Akkadian inscription in Persepolis to the
countrymen in Persis. On the other hand, the text of the gold-tablets
indicates the four extreme points of the empire; Pers.g says “who
granted to Darius the rule over this wide earth on which are many
countries” and hence many gods, whereupon a short list of lands fol
lows; and the very fact that two of the three inscriptions, Pers.e-g, all
on the same panel, are written in foreign languages, evokes at once
the idea of foreign nations and their gods. The “more intimate modula
tion” is an acoustic delusion, and the formula ma^ista baganam appears
only where foreign nations are mentioned.
This is even more evident in the formula “Oramazda uta anyaha
bagaha tye hanti” in Beh. §§62-63, where the Elamite text, both times,
inserts “Oramasta, the god of the Aryans, and the other gods that are,”
namely of the non-Aryans like the Elamites. P. de Vaux remarked in
Rev. Bibl. 1937,12, that the similar addition made by the Babylonian
scribes in the Akk. version of the gold-tablets to OP. “mam Oramazda
patu, viz. itti ilani, A.M. may protect me with the gods” can only mean:
“Marduk the god of Babylon—with whom Nyberg dispenses lightly by
‘Gewiss nicht!’—must have his political share.”
In the postscript to the Behistun inscription, to be dated in 515 B.c.,
two pairs of short paragraphs are appended to the reports on the cam
paign against the European Saka and on the suppression of an Elamite
rebellion, §72:

I did to them. Who worships Oramazda as long as he has power

That the European Scyths and the Elamites did not worship Ora
mazda is a matter of course, and is not the reason for Darius’ campaign
against the former or for suppressing the revolt of the latter. The para
graphs say that the successes teach a moral: the king’s victories over
those aliens are due to the fact that his god is superior to the alien gods,
that Oramazda is ma^ista over the anyaha bagaha tye hanti.
The unpublished gold tablet of Rsama has: “oramazda baga vazraka
hya ma^ista baganam mam ;j^saya^yam akunos, O.M. the great god
who is the greatest of gods made me king.” Since Rsama lived to see
the accession of his grandson Darius, the inscription must not have
been written before his son Vistaspa received Zoroaster in hospitium,
and does not prove the worship of the pre-Zoroastrian AhuraMazdah.
Yet it is possible that Oramazda was the highest god in the pre-Zoroas
trian pantheon of the Parsa.
Nyberg 373: “Damit bin ich vorbereitet, mein Schlussurteil iiber die
Religion der Achaemeniden abzugeben.” It begins “Sie ist von Zara
thustras Werk und dem besonderen Glauben seiner Gemeinde nicht
beriihrt,” and ends “Was (von Hanfrausch unterstiitzte) ekstatische
ubungen [translation of “the best conduct of life”] anlangt, so war
dafiir in dieser Religion ohne Zweifel wenig Raum, und die Hochspan
nung und der Plug der Seele, die der Mensch nun einmal ungern
entbehren mag, wurden in einem ehrlichen Weinrausch gesucht.” To
the ‘Hanf- und Weinrausch” some remarks are to be made under
Homa.’ The reflection on “der Mensch nun einmal = such is life,” finds
an answer in an anecdote, Aghdni 21,167: “al-Muntasir, about 12 years
old, had not said a thing, but had cast glances at his little brother al
Mu'tazz, and their father, al-Mutawakkil, who had observed him said
Muhammad, you have revealed a secret which one must keep veiled!”
One can easily be deceived about one’s own preparation, but the decep
tion about the final judgment is the more unforgivable if the quoted
one is presented as wisdom’s last word: that is not our task.
One must see the whole problem of deva clearly to understand the
inscription Xerxes Pers.daiv., cf. AltpJnschr. n" 14.—^While much has
been criticized, the great mistake I made in ami viii, 1936, 64f., has not



396 deva
been observed: I inferred a date “before Salamis” from the mention of
two groups of lonians, “those in the sea = the true lonians of the west
coast of Asia Minor” and “those beyond the sea = Yona takabara,” Mace
donians of Dar.Beh.
The fact that the inscriptions of Darius and of Xerxes are at variance
in their designations of the lonians is the most important difference in
their lists of satrapies.
Beh., in 520 b.c., has two satrapies: “tye drayahya, those in the sea”
and “yona.” That is the original condition: the first are Cyprus and
Cilicia, the second the lonians of the mainland of Asia Minor. Dar.
Pers.e says the same more explicitly: “yona tye drayahya uta tye hus
kahya, the lonians of the sea and those of the continent.” DarSus.e,
older than NiR., but closer to it than the first two, has: “iawana sa ina
a[ab.ba u sa i]na nibirtim*® nar marratum asbu’, the lonians who dwell
in the sea and those at the coast of the ocean.” NiR. has only yona, sug
gesting the lonians of the two satrapies. It must be said that the Per
sians do not distinguish between Greek tribes, they are all yona.
Xerx.daiv. says, 11.23f. : “yona tya drayahya darayanti uta tye paradarya
darayanti, i.e. lonii quod maris occupant et qui ultramare occupant,”
language and grammar so bad, that one needs the clear Akk. version:
“iawanna sa ina "“'’marrat asbu u sa ahu ullu sa ’“'’marrat asbu, the
lonians who dwell in the sea and who dwell beyond the sea.” This
official term clearly excludes the yona tye huskahya, the real lonians
of the mainland of Asia Minor. The “lonians in the sea” are, as every
where, the Cypriotes, the “lonians beyond the sea” are such Greeks,
yona takabara, as were still under Persian sway, beyond the Bosporus.
In agreement therewith their northern neighbors, the Skudra, are still
mentioned in the list and represented in the tribute processions of Per
sepolis. Pausanias in Byzantium, to whom Xerxes wrote the letter of
thanks, making him an orosanges (see under ‘Last Judgment’) was
on the Persian side till 472 b.c. But Ionia was lost after Plataeae and
Mykale, Sept. 479 b.c. The inscription must be dated after 479 and
before 572, and since it uses still the style of Xerxes’ first period, “speaks
Xerxes the king (not “the great-king”) very close after 479, about
i= Cf. “town Sirqu nlbirtum la nari (purati), on the bank of the Euphrates,” and “luddu
(Ljdia) nagu sa nsbirti tamtim, on the coast of the sea.” nibirtum is not “sa ebir tamtim, beyond the sea,” but translates “tye huskahya,” cf. H. Winckler, Altor.Forschg. 1,513.



DEVA 397
478/77 B.c. The loss of Ionia is silently admitted. This silence, too,
reveals hatred, besides humiliation. One would expect that those who
criticized my interpretation would first have checked the date, but it
has not been done.

Although the scribes no longer master the grammar, the composition
of the text, in its strict parallelism of members, is perfectly clear. The
method of the Akk. translation is just as mechanical as that of the Pahl.
translations of the Awesta: they keep so close to the OP. text as to
renounce their own style, and to become misleading, if one would try
to interpret it as real Akkadian.
The first sentence (a) gives the date of the event: “just after my
accession to the throne,” which is six years back. The fourth sentence
(d) gives the result: Oramazda is installed at the former places of
devayasnian cult. The second . sentence (b) says objectively: revolts
broke out in some of the above-mentioned provinces, they were sup



DEVA
pressed, order was restored. The third sentence (c) gives the reason:
they were the provinces where of old the cult of the deva prevailed;
their temples were destroyed; the cult was prohibited.
The litde grammatical faults—only the inscriptions of Darius
are free of them—do not obscure the purport, ava dahyavam, in
(b), ungrammatical, El. transcription taiiawa (plur.) right,
Akk. translation matate®’, right, is just as pluralistic as the cor
responding expression at the parallel places; devadanam, too,
is a collective singular, meaning a plural. If the provinces and
temples meant only one each, this ought to be expressed by
“eva, among them was one.”
yadatya in (c), which I regarded as equivalent of yadaya
“where” in AltpJnschr., since the Akk. version uses the same
“asar,” is “yada, where” with enkl. causal tya, and has causative
sense: “it was there where = because there”; the clause not only
gives the reason, as I had assumed, but has also causal form.
The prohibition in (c) are state-proceedings, publicly pro
claimed; patiyazbayam is a Median term, and the following
words are an imperative, as in the Akk. version, the proclama
tion itself in direct oration after Vzba-. The translation is:
“When I became king, there were among the above
mentioned provinces such that revolted;
“thereupon, these province (s) I subdued and re
stored order in them;
“and it was among these provinces, because there the
deva had been worshipped before;
“thereupon I razed this devadanam (colksg.) to the
ground and issued the prohibition: The deva
shall not be worshipped!
“Where before the deva had been worshipped, there
I worshipped Oramazda as Rtam, at (with, by)
the brazman!”
The change of reign furnishes the occasion for the revolts ; these affect
more than one province, the names of which Xerxes intentionally
passes over in silence, and which we must determine in order to under
stand the historical event. The reason of the revolt is that the cult of



DEVA 399
the deva still prevailed in those provinces, and after their suppression,
in the course of which places of that cult were destroyed, the cult is
prohibited by a royal data proclaimed by heralds. The former cults are
replaced by that of Oramazda, and were so still in 478/77 or later. This
is not an isolated happening, but a political decision, general and valid
for all future. Those are the conditions an historical interpretation must
fulfill. For me the case is obvious.
Nyberg: “Aus diesem Text hat Herzfeld einen religionsgeschicht
lichen Roman gemacht.” I. Levy, l.c.: “II n’est pas excessif de qualifier
de simple roman cette singuliere reconstitution.” These words are meant
to be a blame, but only show that the authors are no historians. His
torical analysis, the criticism of what we must recognize as facts, is
very much a detective’s work, and historical synthesis differs only in
degree from the work of a novelist.
Nyberg goes on: “Die niichternen Thatsachen sind diese.” On these,
again, J. Levy remarks: “Pour ce qui est des mesures prises contre la
religion egyptienne, H. Hartmann (pupil of H. H. Schaeder, translator
of Nyberg) et Nyberg ne les connaissent manifestement que de seconde

Darius, est fictive; la spoliation du temple par Xerxes est une imposture.
. . . Dans les inscriptions Xerxes s'appelle ‘fils de Ra, seigneur executant
les rites’—ce qui indique un souverain devot et fidele a la politique
de Darius.” Nyberg 347 calls Xerxes “den Exponenten eines Uni
schwunges in der Religionspolitik der Achaemeniden” who “in Ver
folgung des gegeniiber Babylon begriindeten Systems, Athen in Flam
men aufgehen Hess.”
On Babylon: “Les theses de Hartmann et de Nyberg, sur ce point
encore, s’appuient sur une doctrine capricieuse et surannee. . . . Sa
(Hartmann’s) construction est sans consistance et il est surprenant qu’il



400 DEVA
se soit trouve un assyriologue [in Sb.Berl.A}{.d.W 1938, 18] pour I’ap
prouver. Le tableau fort arbitraire que Nyberg presente des actes plus
ou moins sacrileges de Xerxes n’a de toute maniere qu’un rapport loin
tain avec les faits enumeres dans I’inscription de Persepolis.”
Thus, the things are neither “sober,” nor “facts,” and not “important
to retain.” Considerably sobered one better forget them all, save the
unforgettable sentence on p.366: “Die Frage ist jetzt, (a) w^aren die
daeva in der Xerxes Inschrift schlecht well sie nicht-arische Cotter
waren, oder, (b) waren die nicht-arischen Cotter schlecht, well sie
daeva waren?,” a talmudic dilemma which, against all expectation,
Nyberg decides, in 1935, in favor of (b), adding: “Hier finde ich [per
sonal] endlich eine zoroastrische Spur in der Religion der Achaemeni
den” ; shortly after he finds a second trace.
I. Levy tried to explain the inscription in a different way, namely as
dealing with the burning, by Xerxes, of the acropolis of Athens. For
that purpose he must first of all devaluate the contradictory date im
plied by “just after my accession,” but that is no “erreur initiale” of
mine which everybody followed but what the words say. Neither is
any other condition fulfilled: Athens was no province, no deva were
worshipped there whose worship caused a revolt—against Xerxes in
free Athens, the Creek cults were never forbidden by a proclama
tion of Persian law, and were never replaced by the cult of Ora
mazda. Xerxes was “un souverain fidHe a la politique tolerante de
Darius.” Finally, the date of the inscription, after Mykale, rules the
idea out. “I restored order, utasim ga^ava nisadayam, lit. I put them
in their proper place”—while the loss of Ionia is silently admitted
does not refer to Athens. Those who composed the text would not
have dared to hint even at the catastrophe of the Creek campaign.
I have quoted Levy’s criticism because it reveals how “unprepared”
Nyberg-Hartmann were, not because it was right. Athens, Babylon,
Egypt and any other foreign country is from the beginning ruled out
by the real counter-argument against all such attempts: the deva. The
authors of all these romances do not know who the “heavenly ones”
were. They had existed for 2,500 years at Xerxes’ time; over them
Hosyanha and his successors had prayed to become masters; against
them Zoroaster declaimed and composed his gatha Y.32; the fravarani
swears them off; their dynasty went on flourishing in India, where



DEVA 401
“Mahadeo der Herr der Erde” descends “dass er unsresgleichen werde”
(Goethe), and whose place was later occupied in Iran by figures as
sinister as Asmodaeus. Zoroaster’s words “You deva all and who wor
ships you,” and Xerxes’ “It was among those provinces, because the
deva had been worshipped there before” aim at the same deva and
devayasna. “On n’a du proceder ainsi que contre un ennemi particu
lierement execr^ contre des dieux voues a une inimitie capitale.” The
gatha Y.43,8: “ha^yadveso drugvate hiyam!,” the inscription Dar.
NiR.b: “martiyam drozanam ne dosta ahmi!” and the credo “naismi
devo!” are unanimous. Des lors, le probleme est resolu: the mere term
deva precludes all interpretations of the provinces as non-Iranian ones.
The cults prohibited, the temples destroyed, the places where Ora
mazda was installed were the former temples of Vrthragna in Cecista
and Agbatana, of Mithra in Revand near T5s, of Anahita in Susa, and
others of their rank. Whether a non-Iranian temple at some place for
some reason had been more or less destroyed or not, was never the
subject of any Achaemenian inscription.
Xerxes’ words “where before the deva had been worshipped, deva
ayadya, there I worshipped Oramazda, mazdam ayade,” and “the deva
shall not be worshipped, ma yadyesa,” show how the terms mazdayasna,
devayasna and yazata come into being: as an effect only of the religious
struggle of which Xerxes speaks. And nothing could be more exclu
sively Zoroastrian than his word “Oramazdam ayade rtaca, I wor
shipped Oramazda as Rtam.” This one can call a personal idiom of
Zoroaster. There is scarcely one gatha without it, and the Y.Haft. 38,1
makes the pre-Zoroastrian prayer to Ahura-Varuna a Zoroastrian one
by adding “rtat haca, as Rtam” to “Thy wives, o AhuraMazda.”
It was not difficult to see, “du premier jour, combien il est frappant
que Xerxes ne nomme pas les provinces revoltees: I’anonymat est
rigoureux,” because it is the Iranian mother-countries, Mada, Parsa and
Huza, that revolted, where the deva cult indeed had not been extin
guished. It is not only not necessary, but not permissible “fiber die
iranische Welt hinauszugehen, um die daeva zu identifizieren.” And
there is no need to waste words over their being the old “divi” that
have chosen akam mano, and have become KaKol deo'i, all the danger
ous rivals of the ev;;^vatay AhuraMazdah. It was simple to write my
romance, therefore it v/as the better one.



XXVI. RETURN OF THE GODS
Whereas Zoroaster in the gathas, Darius and Xerxes in their inscrip
tions never mention the name of a god other than AhuraMazdah, in
the inscriptions of Artaxerxes II, of a sudden, Mithra and Anahita
appear on the same plane with him. Language and script are entirely
decadent. Berossus said, at a place where he spoke about the Iranian
gods in general, among them Heracles-Vrthragna (Clemens Alex. Pro
treplio C.5, from Chaldaiha. b.iii) ; “After many years had passed, the
Persians started worshipping images of gods in human shape, (an in
novation) introduced by Artaxerxes, son of Darius, son of Ochos,
o? TTparoq A<^po8tTT7? TamiSo? to ayaXpa a.vacTTrjcra's iv Ba

A.ap.d(rK(p Kal "tapSea-ci’ inreSei^e o-e^eLV.” G. Hoffmann, Syr.Akt.
137, Exc. “Nanai,” was the first to interpret the record accurately by
inserting the indispensable [Kat] before Ileporat?, which is Persepolis,
“es handelt sich um die Einfiihrung von Bildern in den viel alteren
Kult und Aufstellung der Idole in den Tempeln aller Provinzialhaupt
stadte.” In the inscription of Mylasa, the Tvxq imcjiavq?. the “varth
ragnian hvarnah, victory-bringing fortuna” of Artaxerxes is invoked.
Berossus’ remark as to the statues is only a striking detail of much
wider reaching measures. Just as the silence of Darius and Xerxes, thus
the mention of the names Mithra and Anahita in Artaxerxes’ inscrip
tions indicates a general religious attitude: he was the “exponent” of
the change. At his time, the whole old pantheon had come back. Many
passages of the yashts, first of all the Mithra and Tistriya yashts, reveal
this process unmistakably.
Y/.io,i: “at yat mi^ram yim vurugavyutim fradaSam azam ... at
dim [in Y/.8,5o: avam staram yim tistriyam] daSam avantam yasnyata
avantam vahmyata [and in 8,50: avantam ;j^sno0wata avantam frasastata] ya^a mam.cit yim ahuram mazdam, when I created Mithra, I
. . . , I created him [or: the Tistriya star] with equal claim to sacri
fices, praise [Tistriya: obedience, public proclamation] as Me myself, the AhuraMazdah!”
This sentence might be that of a royal edict: “as equally honorable
peer of My Majesty, but Mithra was already Varuna’s peer, before the latter changed his name to AhuraMazdah. avant is a late contracted



RETURN OF THE GODS 403
form of “avavant, tantus,” not “a+ Vba-. strahlen” {Wb.). Barthol
omae explained yasnayata, vahmyata, xsno^wata, frasastata as instr.
of the respective abstr. nouns in -tat; if so, words like “adoranditas”
are awful products of a dead language, like medieval Lat. “spectabilitas”
and worse. The author says “I created him like me,” but did not want to
say that AhuraMazdah created himself, but the others “as adorable as
I am myself.” One must not try to improve grammar and language of
such passages: they were that bad. According to the polytheistic notion
the gods were not “created by Mazdah”; mazdadata is only the pass
word by which they return into the mazdayasnian religion.
YAio,5o: “Mithra, to whom AhuraMazdah allotted a palace, me^
anam fra^wrsat, on the encircling, radiant Kara brzati”; the house
was Mithra’s property, neither a fief, nor rented. By such empty phrases,
of which there are many, the mazdayasnian redactors sanction anew
the old cults. With this question a long theological dissertation deals,
of which several repetitions have found a place in the Mithra and
Tistriya yashts.
In Y/. 10,31, this dissertation follows upon the old song “tuvam ako
vahistasca,” and upon “Mithra as builder of the nmana brzi.mita.” In
Y/. 10,54-60, it stands alone in a patchwork of small fragments, alone
also in st.74. In st.53, Mithra, ustana.zasta, in the Zoroastrian attitude
of prayer, utters in the presence of AhuraMazdah, as “lament,” the
identical words which he recites in 73 “with resounding voice in merry
mood.”
In Y/.8,ii, this dissertation is placed before the myth of Tikriya’s
fight with Apavrta, and the words, separately inserted between the three
phases of that fight and repeated in 15, 17 and 19, belong to it: “This
one, viz. Tistriya, vya^naanyati, talks in the assembly, this one par
sanyati, asks questions!”, ending: “nuram ahmi yasnyasca vahmyasca,
now I have (again) claim to yasna and vahma!” vyaxman is the prehis
toric democratic assembly, the “boule” of the Greeks, “thing” of the
Germanic peoples; vyaxmanya is a late verb.denom. “to talk in parlia
ment, as a demagogue” ; parsanya, another denominative which appears
nowhere else, is “to interpellate.” Between the verses of the old myth,
these words have the effect of a slap in the face. In Y/.8,23-25, they
are repeated, unbearably, between the first lost round and the second



404 RETUBN OF THE GODS
victorious one of Tistriya’s fight, and in 8,50, near the end of the yasht,
intermingled with an extremely old prescription about sacrifices.
The text of this dissertation is: “noit ma nuram [thus in Y^.8,3; in
10,54: at ma noit] martiyaka oxtanamana yasna yazayante ya^a anye
yazataho oxtanamana yasna yazinti; yadi zi ma martiyaka oxtanamana
yasna yazayanta ya0a anye yazataho oxtanamana yasna yazinti . . . ,
not worship me notv men by yasna with-mention-of-my-name as
other yazata are worshipped by yasna with-mention-of-their-names; if
men would worship me by yasna with-mention-of-my-name, as other
yazata are worshipped by yasna with-mention-of-their-name, then. . .
.”
Thereupon follows in y/.8,ii (Tistriya) and in 10,55 and 74 (Mithra)
“fra nrwyo rtawyo ^warstahe zruno ayu susyuyam, then I should come
to the orthodox men at the exact point of time, hvahe gayahe hvanvato
amrtahe upa ^warstahe jaymiyam, then I, of my own sunny, immortal
life [phrase of different origin^] would be punctual to the minute.”
Tistriya adds in 8,11: “evam va avi xsapanam dve va pancasatam va,
for one night, or for two, or be it fifty!”, he evidently is bargaining.
And, in the Mithra yasht, to ease the god’s mind: “oxtanamana ^wa
yasna ra^wiya vaca yazate bara.zo^ro rtava, by yasna with-mention-of
thy-name the orthodox worships thee at the hours of prayer with voice
[song] and zo^ra, libations, oxtanamana ^wa yasna ra^wiya vaca sura
mi^ra yazai zo^rabyo, by yasna with-mention-of-thy-name I will wor
ship thee, strong Mithra, at the hours of prayer with voice and liba
tions!”
The words upa ^warkahe Jaymiyam in ¥^.10,56 etc., and yavat esa
afs byarixti upa.^warsti frabavat in F?i/.i4,i3 (see under ‘Apam
Napat’) explain each other mutually: “the water shall be ample for
two irrigations at the precise (measured) time (interval),” because
these have their fixed hours, day and night. 0warsta contains the notion
of the measured, returning period : hour. I am not sure what should be
its right grammatical form, ra^wiya, from “ratu, interval, space of
time” contains the notion of “prescribed regularity.”
In Y/.8,24, Tistriya promises, after the tirade of 23: “avi mam avi.
bawriyam, I will offer to me dasanam aspanam 6}0, the power of ten
horses!” and likewise “the power of ten camels, oxen, mountains (!)
^ Zoroaster uses hu\anvant in y.32,2 as attribute o£ rtam, it might originally belong to Hvar Xseta and Yama x^eta.



RETURN OF THE GODS 405
and canals, ustrinam, gavam, garinam, apam navyanam.” Instead of
garinam one must read “xaranam, donkeys” following a translation in
the Gr.Bdh., and for “mam, to me” evidendy “tan, to the men who
worship me with mention-of-my-name I will present. . . The redactor
feels stimulated, by these words, to make AhuraMazdah call in st.25:
“I, I the AhuraMazdah, worship Tistriya by yasna with-mention-of
his-name, I will give him the power of ten horses, camels etc.,” whereas
the return present ought to surpass the gift.
In Y^.8,50, Tistriya has claim to the frasasti, the governmental procla
mation, and in the Mithra yasht the dissertation ends in 10,60: “We
worship Mithra, whose is the good frasasti,” the public proclamation.
So, this proclamation is the aim of the dissertation.
One can trace the origin of the peculiar term “oxtanaman, with
mention-of-name,” opp. to “anonymous.”
“uti ya va vahvis ahuro mazda naman daSat vahuda
yat va daSat tais va yazamade, thus, with the names that AhuraMaz
dah, the giver of all that is good, gave you, when he created you, with
those we want to worship you!”
Many feminine names precede this sentence, among them the earth,
waters, Rtis and Parandi, the armatayo (plural!) and a number of
abstractions, all called “wives of AhuraMazdah.” However obscure the
collection of just these names, one sees the “names given by Ahura
Mazdah at the creation” indicate that they must be taken not in their
vulgar, but in a special, perhaps symbolic value: it is Zoroaster who
made his AhuraMazdah grant those names. That is a thought of the
Yasna haftahati.
In the gatha 51,22 we find:
yahya moi rtat haca vahistam yasne pati
veda mazda ahuro yoi aharca hantica
tarn yazai hvais namanis parica Jasai vanta
Not till comparing it with the often used yahya-hatam formula of
Y which is derived from it, does this dark stanza become
intelligible
-Edition and translations give this text in y.27,15 and refer to it in y.41,7; but 41,7 is the original place to which the others should refer.



4o6 RETURN OF THE GODS
yahya hatam at yasne pati vahyo
mazda ahuro veda rtat haca
yahatnca tansca tasca yazamade
“To whom [masc., gen. because of Vved-] of those that are, then, for
the sake of (their) worship, AhuraMazdah has destined paradise
[vahyo, comp. abs. = vahistam] through [the mouth of] Rtam—and
to whom [fern.] —those [m. and fern.] we worship!”
y.5 1,22 is accordingly: “To whom, for my sake, AhuraMazdah
through Rtam has destined paradise as reward for their worship, those
who were and those who are, those I want to worship in their (own)
name and to circumambulate with songs of praise!”
moi, dat. of purpose, here translated “for my sake” is not an expletive,
but an idiom resembling “for my name’s sake” in the sayings of Christ.
Alongside an accusative and genitive object, it means approximately
that the god “destines” promises on the plea of Zoroaster. The stanza
is the conclusion of the gatha in which Zoroaster tells that the Vehviya
refused to receive him, that Vistaspa gave him hospitium, and that the
two Haugava and MaSyomaha helped him. The whole gatha is a
thanksgiving. “Those who were and those who are” hence are his
helpers. In the same way, Darius concludes his great Behistun inscrip
tion in §§68-69 “these are the men who at that time . . . cooperated as
my helpers,” and “You who will be king in future, do honor to the
issue of these men!” Zoroaster adores his helpers with songs “in their
own name,” his “sacrifices,” and with circumambulation—taw^, cf.
Y.51,8—and promises them paradise. Darius rewards them and imposes
upon his successors the responsibility to reward their issue. Shahpuhr I,
in the Ka‘ba inscription, institutes masses to be celebrated for “those
who were under Papak, who were under Ardashir, who are under
Shahpuhr” and the same is the purport of the great list of names in
yr.13.
Duchesne, §274, uses oxtanaman as an example for his thesis: “Si un
compose de caractere liturgique . . . apparalt dans un yasht, c’est dans
un passage non-metrique.” This must be combined with Christensen’s
constatation : “Les yashts originaux n’etaient guere destines, a I’origine, a
servir de textes liturgiques.” It follows, on the one hand, that the metrical
passages are non-liturgical, on the other, that the time of poetry had
passed, that the language was dead when oxtanaman was formed. The



RETURN OF THE GODS 407
term means the opposite of “anonymous.” But how could a god not be
called by his name in a prayer, or how could he need the “good frasas
tis,” how could his “being worthy of the frasastis” be the condition to
be called by name.^ It is the same frasastis that Zoroaster hopes to
obtain in Y.49,7, the proclamation of a data, a royal edict, by heralds,
frasahya, as in the book of Esther: “and this order of the king may
resound all over the empire!” The author of the frasastis, hence, is not
AhuraMazdah, but the king, namely Artaxerxes II. Because he had
given the frasastis for the cult of Mithra and Tistriya, those who pray
dare again to call them o^tanaman, under their own names. The
interval more than once designated in the Tistriya yasht by “nuram,
now', today” is that betw'een the interdiction by Xerxes and the sanc
tion by Artaxerxes II. It seems that Xerxes, going far beyond Darius,
had prohibited not only the cult, but the liturgical “call” of the zotar,
the mu’adhdhin, if not the invocation in prayer itself.
It is not significant that the late 'Yta.x says “I want to worship o^ta
naman the star Vanant” (Wega), nor that in a long enumera
tion ends w'ith “and the (= every) oxtanaman yazata.” But it is note
worthy that in y.1,3 and 2,3 Mithra, in Y.3,20 Srosa, in 3,21 Homa are
called oxtanaman yazata. yazata is “who must be worshipped,” oxta
naman yazata is “w'hom it is permitted to w'orship under his own name.”
The term is never applied to Armatis or Rtis, who were never ban
ished. The dissertation has not been interpolated in the Anahit-Yasht,
but we know, through Berossus, that she too was a goddess “whom it
is permitted to invoke by name.”
The st.51-54 of the Tistriya yasht explain how foolish it w'ould have
been not to grant to the god the frasastis, of which he was worthy
(according to st.50) : “Tistriya is the adversary of the parika duzyarya
yam martiyaka avi duzvacaho huyaryam ojate, of the bad-fairy ‘bad
year’ W'hom vulgar (Middle Persian) speaking people call ‘good-year.’ ”
The euphemistic huyarya and the classification as parika are not older
than the time when the stanza w'as composed; from the analogies in
the Videvdad this date was about the beginning of our era.
St.52: “yazi azam noit daSyam avam sti-am yim tistriyam avan
tam yasnyata etc. etc. 54: hamahya zi me iSa ayan hamahya va xsapo
- - duzyarya vispahya ahos - - paroit pari^nam”’ ahvam ava.hisiSyat,
3 Cf. EI. p^rram.pelam <] OP. *'tramfram, meaning rohuwabohu, under ‘Vehviva.'



RETURN OF THE GODS
408
if I had not made the star Tistriya my equal for ‘adoranditas’ etc. etc.
(to enable him to light ‘bad-year,’ §51 repeats in extenso) then, now,
nuram, here, every day and every night, duzyaram would ruin the
human world all upside-down!”
This is an argument for the reintroduction of the cult of Tistriya,
of a political and opportunistic kind. For the reintroduction of Mithra,
Y/.io,92 (first part repeated in ¥.57,24) gives a religious reasoning:
“This (Zoroastrian) religion w'as professed by the orthodox Ahura
Mazd^, by Vahumano, Rtam vahistam, Xsa^ram varyam, Spanta
armatis, Harvata-Amrtata, by the Amrta Spanta [the figures just men
tioned], according to the rite of the church, brja denayai [wrong case]
;
Mazdah conferred upon Mithra the judicature over the earth, ge^a
(plur.), fra he mazda ratu^vvam barat ge^anam [just as he confers
in the inscriptions the kingship upon the kings, xsa^ram fra.barati],
who sees in him (Mithra) the ratu and ahu, judge and justiciary [OP.
framataram] and the healer [or: reformator, yozdataram] of the crea
tures.” Mithra’s “conversion” to the right religion is nowhere expressly
stated, and the last part of the sentence sounds as if there were doubts
whether the old god of revenge had indeed become judge and justiciary’
in the organization of heaven. In Zoroaster’s concept this could only
be AhuraMazdah himself. Y/.io,io3: “AhuraMazdah nominated Mithra as hartar and awya
XStar, keeper and guardian of his creation,” because he never sleeps.
Likewise, his bailiff Sroso receives the post of dena.dis “instructor of
religion,” and in Y.57,23 it is his doctrine that all others accept: he is
the chastiser. Homa takes care of the libations. Thus, the kingdom of
heaven becomes a state in heaven, after the state on earth had devel
oped a church. The theology is as poor as the language. It is pathetic
to see how these theological poetasters figured out the “sanction” of
Mithra. Yr.io,io6 describes the “Revenger” as entirely harmless and
orthodox: “no earthly man . . . thinks so well, talks so well, behaves
so well.”
But however piteous all this may be, it reveals the historical process
in absolute chronology. How the cults banished by Zoroaster were
reintroduced into the Mazdaism of the last Achaemenian phase is
perfectly obvious. After their great time in the Median empire, Mithra
and Tistriya—and with them other gods—had been interdicted at the



RETURN OF THE GODS 409
beginning of the Achaemenian period. People did not dare pray to
them in their name. Then, after their alleged conversion to Zoroastrism,
or out of fear of war and famine, they were again sanctioned by Arta
xerxes II and admitted into the mazdayasnian Olymp like the Amrta
Spanta, with fixed and limited function; Mithra’s province is judging
and watching, in the way Astyages and Croesus received a province
from Cyrus. The reintroduction was not a caprice of Artaxerxes, but
the sanction of a condition that existed already before 400 b.c. Verses
like those on “Mithra’s Passion” are composed between Artaxerxes II
and Alexander, or even later.
One sees also that it was Zoroaster’s doctrine that caused the cults to
be temporarily suspended. E.g. Y/.iOjiip: “You, o Spitama, shall wor
ship Mithra, tell the pupils about him!” Poor prophet in the posthumous
role as schoolteacher: that w'as just what he did not want to teach.
The order or admonition of the god, or better of the redactor, is the
form under which things that do not belong to it were introduced into
Zoroastrism. If the genuine doctrine, let alone Zoroaster himself
as Nyberg believes—had accepted Mithra, there was no need for a re
minder.
The deva-inscription of Xerxes is the most important document for
the religious history among the OP. inscriptions so far known. After
Darius had granted, about 520 b.c., the frasastis to the pure Zoroastrism
which he himself professes in Behistun and in his tomb inscription,
Xerxes, having suppressed the revolts that broke out at his accession
in consequence of this innovation, interdicted, not later than 480 b.c.,
the cult of the old gods entirely, destroying the temples and even pro
hibiting prayer. But already Artaxerxes II, who invokes in his inscrip
tions Mithra and Anahita oxtanaman besides AhuraMazdah, who,
according to Berossus, ordered to put up statues of Anahita in the tem
ples of all provincial capitals, and of whose “victory-bringing hvarnah”
the Mylasa inscription talks—thereby has revoked the prohibition of
Xerxes, and sanctioned by his frasastis, given about 400 b.c., the return
of the old deva, henceforth called yazata.
Those are the three documentary dates we have so far concerning
the real history of Zoroastrism. They agree with the traditional date
that places Zoroaster between 570 and 500 b.c., and with the date of



410 RETURN OF THE GODS
the pre-Zoroastrian parts of the Mihr-Yasht which can be determined
between 612 and 550 (see under ‘Mithra’).
There is much more to be seen. One needs only to think of any line
of a Greek author of that period and to confront it with the poorness
of mind which the passion of Mithra displays, to understand that the
conquest of Iran by Hellenism was unavoidable and imminent.

The “creed” of Yasna 12 is an archaic oath taken by the client
when admitted into a clan. The true Zoroastrian creed is Y.49,3:
“In our profession of faith is embodied (the tenet) : Rtam, Right,
shall be strengthened, Druxs, Evil, shall be destroyed! I desire
the union with Vahumano, Good-Will, I renounce every com
munion with the drugvant, evildoer.” Definition of terms, “deva
yasna, zaraflustri, mazdayasna.”
XXVIII. MITHR A: 422
Pre-Zoroastrian god of social order. Several old songs collected in
his yasht can be dated in the time of immigration, about 700 b.c.,

ZOROASTER AND HIS WORLD






XXVII. FRAVARANI
Y.30, the “Gatha of Good and Evil,” ends in st.11:
yat ta rvata sisada ya mazda dadat martiyaho
huvitica aniti hyatca drgam drugvadbyo raso
savaca rtavabyo at api tais ahati usta
“O would, you men would grasp the laws which Mazdah has estab
lished, bliss and torment, for ever perdition to the drugvant, salvation
to the rtavan! Thus it shall be at the end, according to His will!”
Bartholomae: “Wenn ihr euch die Bestimmungen merkt, die
M. geschaffen hat, ihr Menschen—das Wohlbehagen (einer
seits) und (andrerseits) die Qual, den langen (i.e. ewigen)
Schaden fiir die Drugvant und den Nutzen fur die rtavan:
dann wird es kunftig wohl werden!”
Lommel-Andreas : “Wenn ihr Menschen die Satzungen lehrt,
die der Weise gegeben hat, einerseits den richtigen und falschen
Wandel, andrerseits die lange Pein fiir die Ungerechten, und
das Heil fiir die Gerechten, dann wird es hernach dadurch nach
Wunsch sein.”
Both translations fail entirely to grasp the purport of the verses. The
entire gatha speaks of the foundation of ethics, and this last stanza
resumes. It ends with an amen, usta! cf. usta stoi! half inshallah, half
amen, in Y.46,16 (under ‘Hospitium’) and usta ahmai hiyat! in the
Rtamvahu. usta, like OP. vasna, is always the will of God. The prayer
that opens the Gatha UstavatJ, Y.43,1, expresses it clearly:
usta ahmai yahmai usta kahmaicit
vaso-^sayans mazda dayat ahuro
“According to (Thy) will give us, (give) everybody—whom freely
ruling as He wills the Lord will give it— (give) me . . . award of riches
and life in paradise!” Cf. Y.29,4: a 0a ahat ya#a ho vasat, thus be it as
He wills! and Mar\ 14,31: a\\’ ov rt i-yco 6i\co a\\a tl crvl 1
hiyat drgam, with hiyat = siet, is syn. of Gath, hyat frasatamam and
OP. hiya duvestam, for all eternity!, and the optative continues in at
. . . ahati, which corresponds to ya0a ahat apamam in st.4 of the same
1 Late Aw. usta.brti is “congratulation,” as also the n.abstr. ustatat, cf. ‘Tistriya.’



FRAVARANI

gatha. api tais is “at the very end” of the world, not “hernach dadurch.”
huviti is “welfare, salvation” in paradise; aniti or initi? replaces the
exact antonym dusiti (in Y.1,8), n.abstr. of Aw. duzita, Ved. durita,
(not=dus.siti “bad dwelling”), torment in hell.
rvata is the fundamental Law, OI. vrata, “the Law of Varuna,” which
AhuraMazdah dadat, has given as vo/xo^errjs at the creation, in Y.43,5;
predetermined by the two primordial principles in Y.30,4, see under
‘Yama.’ And this fundamental law is:
drugvadbyo raso, savaca rtavabyo!
Y.51,9, text under ‘Last Judgment’: “The hearing which Thou or
dainest for the two parties by Thy red fire, by molten metal to impress
into the minds as brand
:
rasayahe drugvantam, savayo rtavanam
!
The drugvant shall be destroyed, the rtavan shall be saved!” Those are
the “two sava,” perdition and salvation, gods and men receive at the last
judgment.
Y.49 begins with the two stanzas (under ‘Bandva’) on Zoroaster’s
brother-in-law and his “tkeso drugva dbita rtat rariso, the drug-ish
judge who in two ways injures Rtam,” and does not confirm the tenet
“spantam ahmai stoi armatim!, Holy Armatis, be mine!” So says Y.
32,1 (under ‘Armatis’) : “If the gods and men would strive to obtain
Mazdah’s grace, offering their obedience, the god would reply: ‘We
love your holy Armatis, she be Ours!’ ” Thus the god returns the oath
of fidelity of his adherents. Y.49 §oes on> in st -3 :
atca ahmai
rtam sudyai
ta vahos
antar vispan
varnai mazda nidatam
tkesai rasayahe drills
saro izya manaho
drugvato haxman mruve
“But in our profession of faith (the article) is embodied (lit. laid
down): Rtam shall be strengthened!, in our law (the article): the
Druxs shall be destroyed! I desire the union with Vahumano, I re
nounce (Lat. interdico) every communion with the drugvant!”
This is the true credo, the profession of faith of Zoroaster, and has
remained unrecognized.



FRAVARANI 4 r3
Bartholomae: “Und in diesem unsren Glauben ist das rta
niedergelegt um den Nutzen—in die Afterlehre die drug um
den Schaden zu schaffen. Darum verlange ich, dass man sich
an Vohumanah anschliesse. Jegliche Gemeinschaft mit dem
drugvant ist aufzukiindigen!”
Lommel: “Uns ist zur Wahl hingestellt das Wahrsein zum
Heil, der Irrlehre zum Verderben die Luge. Deshalb strebe ich
nach enger (Familien-)Verbindung mit dem Guten-Denken,
ich sage mich los von alien Freundschaften mit dem Liigner!”
tkesa, “law,” are the rvata which Mazdah dadat in 40,1 1 ; the
two infinitives (Benveniste pp. 70 and 77), sudyai and rasayahe,
are the commandments: rtam esse augendum, dru^s esse delen
dam! As Benveniste observes, rta is “une notion purement pas
sive” which needs to be increased. The rtat rariso or zita.rta
who “decreases” rtam has forfeited his life. The Zoroastrian
thought is the origin of Mani’s doctrine of Light.
varna is here as elsewhere the “creed, profession,” Aw. fra
varani, in which the two fundamental articles are “laid down,
nidatam”; Vsar- and Vhak- are the terms for the social bonds
in vis and zantu.
The so-called “fravarani” of Y.12—see under ‘Deva’—generally be
lieved to be the Zoroastrian creed, has taken over some of the original
articles, cf. Y.32,2 “You gods all . . . are the brood of the Evil Spirit”
or Y.34,6: “We have severed ourselves from the whole brood of snakes,
whether gods or men!” It says, Y.12,1: “I challenge, naismi, the gods,
devo (sic), I swear as a Mazdayasnian, Zoroastrian, videvo enemy-of
the-gods, as ahura.tkeso abiding-in-the-law : I acknowledge that all
good that is is AhuraMazdah’s ! 12,2: I love the holy Armatis, she be
mine! 12,4: “I renounce communion with the deva, as Zoroaster did.”
But originally this fravarani was something entirely different.
naismi, to Vnid-, IE. V'neid-, MHG. nit “hatred,” Gr.
weiSo?; deva plus Vnid- is here opposed to mazdah plus
Vyad-, as elsewhere nista to stota (=vow). The original mean
ing is “to defy,” namely the invectives with which the heroes
challenge each other before a single combat, e.g. Atar and the



414 FRAVARANI
three-mouthed dragon in Yr.19,47 or SnaviSka in Y/.i9,43. devo
is not an “unthem. acc. pi.” ( Wb.) but ungrammatical, and
reveals from the start the decay of the language: the fravarani
is under no condition older than 400 b.c. and probably post
Achaemenian.
ahura.tkesa is the adherent of the tkesa, the “law” of the ahura,
lord justiciary, as part of the Zoroastrian dena, not “Anhanger der
Lehre, doctrine.”
St. 2 and 3 explain armatis as “obedience to law” by speaking about
this subject:
2: “us gaus stuve tayatca hazahatca, I swear off theft and robbing
of cattle; zyani, damage (Lat. noxa) and vivapa, injury done to the
fields of the vis, the clans, of the Mazdayasnians.” 3: “I acknowledge
(the right of) the manya, men of the nmana, familia, that live on this
earth by cattle-breeding, gaubis sayanti, to rove freely (as nomads)
vaso.yatim, and to settle freely, vaso.sitim; with prosternation I vow:
henceforth, I will not commit any noxa, any injury to the fields against
the vis of Mazdayasnians, I will not devise bodily injury and homicide!”
Six crimes are sworn off: The first two, theft and robbing, against
live property; gaus—as also in the Cod.Hammurapi—enters as one for
all kinds of cattle. The second two crimes, zyani and vivapa, again, are
only examples for every possible delict against immobile property.
“Grazing” is the main cause of trouble in all extensive cattle-breeding.
The old Slavic law says: “one zupa (= vis) shall not let graze their
cattle on land of another zupa.” The third pair, finally, are crimes
against the men themselves. The words “I will not devise” limit the
vow to crimes “with malice prepense,” delicta dolosa.
The short sentences are paralleled by the laws which, in Deuter. 20
23, follow upon the Ten Commandments. There, the law on serfdom

not represented in the fravarani—comes first, in 21 ; homicide, bodily
injury, theft and robbing, aimed at live stock, follow in 21,16; 22,3;
delicts against immobile property in 20,4-7.
Bartholomae’s old translation was about right; hard to understand
how Hertel could go back to “nicht wenn ich an Gebein, wenn ich
an der Lebenskraft geschadigt, d.i. durch Folterung oder Totung (sic)
dazu gezwungen wiirde,” and Nyberg “im Streben fur meinen Leib
oder meinen Lebensgeist.”



FRAVARANI 415
The oath contains the all-important restriction: “against the vis of
Mazdayasnians, mazdayasnanam visam.” All crimes are crimina pub
lica, and the vis is, since the IE. epoch—just as with the Semites
the social group bound to revenge such crimes. The notion of the “cri
men” does not extend beyond the limit of the vis. Caesar reports the
same restriction as valid with the Germans. That is a very archaic phase
of legal and moral notions, whereas the fravarani as such is considerably
younger than Zoroaster’s time. Zoroaster replaced the notion of crimes
against the social group by that of sins against a moral principle.
Therefore, obviously, the restriction by “visam” is pre-Zoroastrian and
genuine; “mazdayasnanam” on the contrary is interpolated, at the post
Zoroastrian period of Mazdaism. Thereby a primeval formula was
adapted to the religious purpose, by the same redactors who combined
it with quotations from the gathas. But the original purpose was not
religious at all. The vow had no relation to the profession of Zoroas
trism, but was the traditional oath, an “aryaman, client” had to swear
when admitted into the “vis.”
The “Tables of Numa” say: “Si quis hominem liberum dolo sciens
duit paricidas esto.” The premeditated crime against the class of liberi,
iXevdepoi, maniya, the murder of a free member of the “gens,” is
considered like next-of-kin murder, as sacrilege. That is a more ad
vanced phase of legal interpretation, but throws light upon the passage
of the fravarani: the murder of a free man, manya,2 is sworn off, the
murder of a slave or serf, is subsumed under theft and robbing of
gaus, cattle.
§§6 and 7 of the fravarani are discussed under ‘Deva.’ §8 says only:
“I profess my being a Mazdayasnian, a Zoroastrian, by credo and oath,
astutasca fravartasca.” §9: “I take the oath, astuve, upon the mazdayas
nian religion, dena mazdayasnl, which is fraspa.yoxSra nida.snafhs.”3
The thought of the relative clause, that the mazdayasnian religion
2 Bartholomae misunderstood manya everywhere, H^.1896: “autoritativ,” even in Yai7,io, where the ladies of the house, nmana, expect “authoritatively” their husbands in the bedroom. Nvberg translates “begiitert,” to the effect that people without estate were allowed to be killed. y.47,4 says: “Though he may have little [kasoscit, belongs to rtavan], towards an rtavan one shall be friendly; but, even being in need, is\acit bans [see under ‘Hospitium’] one shall be bad, aka, towards a drugvant, however rich.” The manya are Akk. mar awelim, Arab, ahl al-bait, abna al-nas. 3 “fraspa.yoxSra, wiping out witchcraft” Pahl. transl. fracawgand-ayozisnlh; yoxsti is magic “binding,” to V yug- iungere. Cf. “spayaflra” under ‘Astronomy.’



FRAVARANI
416
breaks magic, resembles the tale of how Moses outdoes the Egyptian
sorcerers in Exod. 7-9. The mazdayasnian religion has also the power
of wiping out all misdeeds committed before it was espoused; but
although the words are part of the late credo, Zoroaster’s spirit is not in them.
Vid.3,39: “The sin of burying dogs or men cannot be wiped out,
spayate, by any punishment, by any purification.” §40 admits one excep
tion, showing a changed conception of law: “if the culprit embraces
the mazdayasnian religion.” §41 gives the reason: “spayate dena maz
dayasnls nars astavanahya vispe syo#na yacica vrzati, for the maz
dayasnian religion wipes out all actions, whatever he has committed,
of the man who embraces it, rubs off every evil thought, like a high
wind blowing from the south sweeps the atmosphere clean, framrzati
vispam dusmatam . . . manayan ya#a vato brzi.taka#ro #wartam
dasinat pari framrzoit.” spayati, here, is syn. of fra.mrz- “rub off,” with
the connotation of purgation, purification.4
mazdayasna, the noun, in the fravarani self-appellation of the neo
phyte, and the adj. visam mazdayasnanam—also in dena mazdayasnis
for the religion itself in the introductory paragraph of Y .Haft. 35,1
is a term totally absent from the gathas, the Yasna haftahati, the OP.
inscriptions, and, of course, from the genuinely old parts of the yashts.
As a nom. propr. mazdayasna appears in the memorial document of
Yt. 13 and on a tablet from Nippur, dated “a0
3 of Darius II,” i.e.
421 b.c.: ma.az.da.is/z.na. In the Pap.El. Sachau 11,6 = Cowley 37, we
find: “The peqid of our town is mzdyzn ... we are afraid. . . .” Rsama,
addressee of the letter, was satrap in 435 and left Egypt in 410; the
4 Vspi-, spa- is not sufficiently treated in IVb.—Vid. 3,35: “Who does not pay the salary a
pious man has earned by his labor, avi tarn spayat spantaya armatois tamo aca . . . acistam aca
ahum, shall be cast out from the earth into darkness and hell.” Cf. Ogm.2 8: “mi mam ahrai
varim fra.spayois, do not cast me out into the pit of hell!”; cf. scum, offscum, Ir. spama = kafa
Ibsen, in Kaiser und Galilaeer says: “Sci verflucht, Gott hat dich aus seinem Munde ausgespien!”
y/,14,13: “ustro kafam api.spavati”: kafa “foam, froth,” syn. of spama—Lat. sputum^ spuma
Hence: “the male camel spits, spayati, itself full of spittle." And X'id.6, 26: “A corpse has been
discovered in water; prescription: as much as one can seize with the hands shall be dragged out
and laid on dr> soil, noit astSm nuit varsdm noit spaman noit mu0ram noit vanhut5ta°m pari
spJti Spam astrv ante," a sentence giving the reason: “for one must not, by pari.spati of bones
hair, spama 'spittle,’ muflra ‘urine,' vanhutat ‘drops of blood’ (Pahl. x un tacijnih not ‘sam
guinitas’ Wb.) etc, sin against the water.” pari.spati spamam is a fig. etvm,, “bv spitting spittle
around.” This V spi-, sp5 -. evidently belongs to Lat. spuo. Got. speivvan. And the basic sig
niflcation is not “lacere, abicere” {wb.), but at the best “eicere,” towards “excretion excre
ment.”



FRAVARANI 417
personal names in the fragment recur on papyri dated 420-410, and
Cowley puts the date of this fragment in “about 410 b.c.”
One must distinguish between the use of the word as a n.pr., entirely
inoffensive as a theophoric name of people with a polytheistic religion,
and its use as designation of the post-Zoroastrian religion. In the
papyrus, mzdyzn is not a n.pr., because “we are afraid” implies: a
mazdayasnian is unfriendly towards our religion. 410 b.c. is the very
time in which this term appears first in the Awesta. There it is restricted
to those parts that have a claim to the—wrongly used—designation
“Younger Awesta,” namely parts not older than the syncretistic redac
tion under Artaxerxes II, or possibly the end of the reign of Darius II.
At that very period devayasna, too, appears for the first time, namely
in quotations from the cycles of legends that grew round Zoroaster and
Vistaspa and had been attached to the older cycles of the epics and
introduced in the yashts. The two antonyms originated together and
refer to each other, see under ‘Deva.’
In Yr.14,54, the Indian soldiers, mockingly called Vyambura.dlva
martiyaka, are not designated as devayasna, but as devayazo imitating
Skr. devayaj, and these verses belong to the same period, the very end
of the fifth century, see under ‘Krsvar.’
Artaxerxes II, by again permitting the old cults, sanctioned condi
tions actually existing at his accession: the old gods had come back into
Zoroastrism under Artaxerxes I and Darius II. Therefore, the neophytes
of the fravarani call themselves not only mazdayasna but also zaraflus
tris. The first word cannot mean the real Zoroastrism, but the syn
cretism of that period. The mazdayasna curse the deva, but pray to
the yazata, the same deva under their new generic name. Thus, deva
yasna is the right term for the pre-Zoroastrian polytheism, zarafhistris
for Zoroaster’s own monotheism, and mazdayasna the term for the post
Zoroastrian syncretism. One must speak of these three phases of the
religion as devayasnian, zoroastrian and mazdayasnian, and can also
say Deva'ism, Zoroastrism and Mazdai'sm.
Pap.El. 10,6 is the only place where the form mzdyzn, with
-zn-, appears. Nyberg 342: “Ein mazdah-Verehrer hiess im Wes
ten mazdayazna mit medischer Lautform, deutlich unterschie



4x8 FRAVARANI
den von dem Aw. mazdayasna” (with -sn-). 3 zn:sn, voiced
and breathed sibilant as two correspondents of pre-Aryan pre
palatal before nasal, are thus represented as proof that Awestic
cannot be a Median dialect; zntsn would imply the solution
of one of the great problems of Iranian history, the “East Ira
nian home of the Awesta.” The attitude is utterly naive, and the
reason totally insufficient.
H. Hartmann, to whose elaboration of the subject Nyberg
refers, says: “Arm. mazdezn ist aus dem Parthischen entlehnt”
and later “damit haben wir den Beweis, dass mazdayazna

kein altpersisches Wort [who would ever have thought so?]
nicht aus der Sprache des Awesta, sondern aus dem Medischen
ubernommen wurde.” This is extremely confusing and con
fused: most misunderstandings come from inaccurate terminol
ogy. “Parthian” is a geographic and ethnic term opposed to
Median; Hartmann uses it as a chronologic term for a certain
period of Median. He wants to say that Arm. mazdezn was
borrowed from Median during the Arsacid period.
The Iranian loanwords in the Aram, papyri, in Daniel and
Ezra, furthermore some loanwords and more proper names
in the Akk. versions cf the OP. inscriptions follow the usage
of writing and language taught in the school of Babylon, which
is also the source of the system of ideograms in Arsacid pah
lavik. The loanwords which belong to the spheres of religion
and administration are, where the difference is clear, almost
all Median, not Old Persian. These Aramaic scribes cf Babylon
had close relations to those of Agbatana, but they did not speak
any vulgar dialect, but a literary language. All is erudition.
The form mzdyzn, used about 410 b.c. in the papyrus, reap
pears about 650 years later in the Pahlavik versions of the Sasa
nian inscriptions, in the Parthian (as opp. to Median) title
5 Hartmann’s thesis in olz 40, 19^7, Sp 157 is: ‘'Prepa^atal before n is as a rule assimilated
to the preponderant final sound of the stem, Aw. \arna < *\azna; the forms of the stem >az-,
ending regular!} in -z, arc so numerous that z o£ Xazna, according to phonetic law, is not maintained, but replaced b> z.” “In Median it must ha\e been the same, as prosed b> Arm. mazdezn which is a loanword from Parthian.” ‘ But m OP. the^e presumptions are lacking, because there the stem ya5- always ends in dental: therefore hahn-, according to phon. law, is maintained.” The distinction between GP. \a5 -, NP. >a ; n and Aw. vaz-, \asna is clear without that; apart from it, the presentation, which does not consider the possible identity of Awestic and Median, does only prove that -sn- : -zn- is a secondary difference of small significance.



FRAVARA MI
“mazdezn bag, the mazdah-worshipper, the god”—an idea
similar to the “most-catholic Majesty”—and in the name of the
religion “den mazdezn” (with zn as opp. to dena mazdayasnis
of the Awesta). The official Pahlavlk, to which the terms be
long, must have been established—it is indifferent from which
dialects it was derived—during the first hundred years of the
Arsacid empire in Parthia; the conquest of Media did certainly
not cause a change in the protocol. Titles are constant: the old
Persians did not even assimilate x^ayaffya vazraka, borrowed
from Median, to their own dialect; all the less reason to assume
that the Parthians would have assimilated a title of their own
to a foreign dialect. Arm. mazdezn is indeed a loanword from
Parthian, however not in the sense Hartmann uses it, viz. a
vulgar dialect of Media, but from official Pahlavik.
Since the time of Ardashir I, the Parsik inscriptions offer
mzdysn = mazdesn, which comes neither from an OP. Tnaz
dayasna (to be expected according to NP. yasn), nor from a
Med. Tnazdayazna. The assertion “Im Westen hiess ein Maz
dah-Verehrer mazdayazna mit medischer Lautform” is wrong.
MP. mazdesn, at the same time, disproves the assumption that
a Med. ‘mazdayazna had ever been borrowed by Old Persian.
In order to explain the etymology of younger forms, we use
to construct older forms, but that does not always mean that
these existed in the older language. Already at the end of the
6th century b.c. OP. -aya- was contracted to e, as the contem
porary transliterations of the names of Darius and Xerxes

besides many others—show. The inscriptions of Artaxerxes II
and III—besides Akk. and Aram, transcriptions of Iran, names
—show that as early as 400 b.c. the terminations of the inflec
tion were dropped. The attempt made in these inscriptions to
maintain the forms of the older language is a complete failure;
the contemporary attempts of the “Younger Awesta” to write
in “hizvo danhaha, learned language” are better, but not good.
In 421 b.c. the Babylonian scribes render the n.pr. mazdayasna
by a trisyllabic mazdaiVma [Akk. cuneiform does not distin
guish s or z at the end of a syllable], and shortly after, under
Artaxerxes II when the word became a very common term, the



420 FRAVARANI
pronunciation was mazdesn or mazdezn, a form to be described
as Middle Iranian. For this word, the written text of the Arsacid
Awesta noted mzdysn, a spelling which in the 4th century a.d.
again was transposed into Awestic script as mazdayasna. As
a religious term the word did not exist at an antiquity where it
was pronounced with four syllables, viz. before or about 600 b.c.
The old Persians did not form it at all in their own dialect,
nor did they borrow an old Median form, they simply used it
in the form it had accepted in about 400 b.c. in “middle Awes
tic”: mazdesn. Nothing can be said against mazdesn or the Aw.
n.pr. mazdayasna belonging to a Median dialect. The word
cannot appear in the gatha, but there its form would be maz
dayazna; mazdezn, borrowed by the Armenians, is a middle
Parthian form.
Mazdayasna does not at all designate the religion of Zoroaster, propa
gated by “missionaries from the East,” but the syncretism since the
time of Artaxerxes II. No Persians and no missionaries ever said maz
dayazna with z.
Nyberg 367: “Das Schliisselwort des Kultes des Xerxes ist ‘anbeten,’
yaS- mit S statt z, beim barzman und mit rta, eine uralte Formel, deren
Konstruktion so altertiimlich ist, dass man bis zur Sprache der Gatha
hinaufgehen muss, um Parallelen zu finden. Die Formel ist medischen
Ursprungs, denn barzman ist eine medische Form.”
“yaS-” is an ordinary padlock that every key opens. “Kult des
Xerxes” sounds as if it was different from that of other Achaemenids.
“Going back to the language of the Gathas” presumes a great interval
as a given fact: if it was only 40-50 years, one would not have far to
go. Indeed, “rtaca,” i.e. “as Rtam,” not “with” Rtam, is a personal idiom
of Zoroaster, see under ‘Deva.’
Instead of barzman, the Akk. and El. transcriptions bi.ra.za.am.man.
ni and ph.ra.c.man.ni.ia demand the reading brazman. The OP. for
mula is: Oramazdam ayade (i.p. sg. praet.) or yadesa (imper.) or
yadate (3-sg. pres.) rtaca brazmani, “I worshipped (you shall, he wor
shipped) Oramazda as Rtam at the brazman,” if one takes brazmani
as loc. The original meaning and even the IE. connection of brazman
is obscure. If it was simply Aw. barsman, it would be all the better.



FRAVARANI 42I
It does not appear in the gatha, but the Gath, form would have -zm-.
Meillet, Introd., compared OI. “brahman, pretre” with Rom. flamen;
Hertel equates OI. brahman, Aw. barsman with (^Xey/xa, hence Lat.
flamma; in iiqf vii, 62 n.i, he remarks: “In Ved. ist brahman = Aw.
rtam, im Aw. ist es nur noch ‘Opferstreu,’ d.i. der Sitz, der beim Opfer
fiir die yazata [aus Zweigen] bereitet wird, und auf dem die Opfer
speisen und -tranke vorgesetzt werden; die Gotter werden durch den
Rufer, zotar, zum yasna und barsman eingeladen.” We do not know
enough and etymology alone is unfit to determine the purport of the
old words at a certain period with a special religious group.
mzdyzn and brzmdn, brazman-case, forms used by the Aramaic
scribes of Elephantine, the n.pr. hvarazmis in OP. inscriptions, and
OP. uz.maya-, which may be a techn. term of Median criminal law,
prove nothing for Old Persian phonetics. As a matter of fact, z od s
before nasal is no criterion at all for separating Awestic from other
Median dialects. All reasons adduced are fictitious, and Meillet’s
words of 1924, Trois Conf. 26f., retain their full value: “Peu importent
les indications—toutes empruntees du reste a l’Avesta recent—d’apres
lesquelles l’Avesta se serait constitue dans l’lran Oriental. Meme exactes
elles ne prouveraient rien.”
Before this sentence he said: “La tradition enseigne que Zoroaster
etait originaire du Nord-Ouest de l’lran. . . . Or, si Ton examine la
langue de l’Avesta en general, des gathas en particulier, on reconnait
immediatement, d’abord qu’elle differe du perse, ce qui exclut le Sud
Ouest, puis qu’elle differe aussi du sogdien et du parler du Khotan. . . .
La langue de l’Avesta repose done sur les parlers du Nord-Ouest. En
conclusion d’un memoire rigoureux . . . Dialefltologie der westiran.
Turfantexte (mo xv, 1921, 184-258), M. Paul Tedesco montre que la
langue avestique appartient au groupe des parlers du Nord-Ouest. La
demonstration est obtenue par des procedes purement linguistiques,
independante de la tradition qu’elle vient ainsi confirmer.” Tedesco
has further confirmed this result of his researches in Ostiran. Nominal
flexion, zii iv, 1925, 94-166, see especially §58.
Northwest means Media. Awestic is a Median dialect.



XXVIII. MITHRA
“Es tauchten tausend Theologen
in deines Namens alte Nacht 1 ”

R. M. Rilke
Mithra is an Aryan, pre-Iranian god. As early as in 1400 b.c. he is
invoked, in the dvandva formula mitrassil-urunassil,1 i.e. Mitra and
Varuna, as witness in the political treaties of the Mitanni Aryans. This
small group of Aryans split from the main body of the tribes on their
way towards India, in about 1500, and founded a short-lived empire,
which they called Maiteni, in Mesopotamia. Their own language was
still a dialect of Aryan; in Maiteni, they accepted, as a minority over
an autochthonous population, the language of their subjects.
With the Indo-Aryans the pair of gods lived on; in the Rgveda it is
often invoked as mitra-varuna, whereas to Mitra alone one hymn only
is dedicated, 111,59. Other gods supplanted his cult.
Hertel, Siegesf. 144L, discusses the Ved. expression “mitramasas, as
great as Mitra,” i.e. his equal, and translates RV.x,22: “Hier hort man
von Indra; bei uns, noch heute, wird er gepriesen, der mit der Keule
bewehrte, der sich ebenso wie Mitra unter den Stammen einen Ruhm
erworben hat, der nicht halb ist,” and remarks : “Hier wird Indra dem
awestischen Mithra als ebenbiirtiger Gegner (im Kriege) gegeniiber
gestellt.” Instead of Awestic, one must say Old Iranian. Since the “tribes”
are those of the singers, these would say that their enemy had acquired
with them “not half a fame.” Similarly RV.vu,^-6 : “Dir (Agni) haben
die vasavah [=deva] das Herrscheramt, asuryam, auferlegt, denn sie
fanden Gefallen an deiner Geisteskraft, o Du, der du mitramasas bist,”
explained: “Bezoge man hier mitramasas auf den vedischen Mitra, so
wiirde man dem Dichter . . . Gedankenlosigkeit zutrauen; denn das
Beiwort wiirde besagen, dass Mitra die Herrschaft liber die deva ebenso
gut verdient hatte. Will der Dichter aber sagen : der du dem awestischen
Mithra gewachsen bist, so ist alles in Ordnung.” I am not convinced,
for, Indra would deserve the asuryam only when “greater than,” not
as his enemy’s “equal.” If other gods are measured by Mitra, he must
once have been one of the greatest, and what one actually observes is
his gradual recess in India.

An an name of the capital of the Mitanni countr>.



MITHRA 423
With the Aryans who stayed on in their original home his worship
went on; for at Herodotus’ time the Scolotian Scyths in the north-west
still adored him under the name ToLTocrvpos. The second element of
this name is Ir. sura, /olpios. The fault of the usual interpretation 2 of
the first element as “geda, in sg. immobile property, in pi. world”
is, that Gr. oi and t would represent Ir. e and d. Gr. oi is Ir. oi < avyu,
and goito- is gavyuti; the name is a syn. of the standing epithet vuruga
vyutis of the Ir. Mithra: gavyutisura.
The Iranians brought him with them to Iran, where he survived
Zoroastrism and the old empire, and whence he set out, in Hellenism
and under the Roman empire, on his triumphal march through
Europe, where he finally succumbed to Christianity.
Instead of the Aryan dvandva mitra-varuna, the Awesta has midra
ahura, the meaning of which Duchesne has explained in “Melanges Cumont”: 8
y/.io,ii3:
ta8a no jamyat avahe que viennent a notre secours
midra ahura brzanta Mithra et Ahura les sublimes!
and y/.io,i45:
Midra ahura brzanta Mithra et Ahura les sublimes,
adyajalia rtavana non-menacees, justes,
strsca mahamca huvarca et les etoiles, la lune, le soleil,
urvara pati barsmanya par les plantes du barsman,
midram vispanam Mithra, de toutes les provinces
dahyunam
dahyupatim yazamade le maitre-de-province nous le
venerons
Bartholomae (1904, in Wb.) had not overlooked this dvandva nor
the form ahura-midra which it has assumed in y.1,11 and 2,11; p.1185:
“Zweifellos eine aus arischer Zeit stammende Verbindung,” and 293:
“altiiberkommene feste Verbindungen.” These remarks are not quite
accurate: the formula of T/no is not older than O. Iranian, that of the
Yasna is not old. Hertel, 1931, in Siegesf. 144: “Die Dual-Gottheit
- Thiib Markwart, uge endorsed. in 193?, by G. Hiising. 3 Annales de l’lnst. de phdologic et d’histoire onentules, Bruxelles, t.iv, 683d.

mitra-varuna . . . schon in den Boghazkoi texten bezeugt . . . , im RV.
haufig . . . , fehlt ganzlich im Awesta,” and 132: “Mithra gewann . . .
so viel Anhanger, dass die Ortodoxie ihn Mazdah nebenordnete, was
in dem Dual-komp. mi#ra-ahura, im Yasna ahura-mi#ra, zum sprach
lichen Ausdruck kommt.” Thus, the real discovery, the observation
that the formula in Yt. 10 is correct, while the formula in the two yasna
runs counter to Panini’s dvandva rule,4 was left to Duchesne to make.
It changes the picture entirely and is fundamental for the obscure pre
history of the religion of these nations.
Y.1,11 and 2,11, both, quote Y/.io,i45 in toto. Y.2 introduces it with
“we invite to the yasna,” not involving any formal change; Y.i with
“we put down (this yasna) to the account of . . .” which entails the
transposition—not quite successful—of the dvandva into the instr.-dat.
dual. The interpolations “the creatures of Spanta manyu” to the stars,
and “eye of AhuraMazdah” to the sun, disclose the reason why the
redactors transformed the old mi^ra-ahura: the mazdayasnian ortho
doxy took no offence at the god Mithra himself, but at the placing

linguistically necessary—of Mi#ra in front of Ahura. This had become
a question of rank, and impossible after the period of Zoroaster.
The two yasna passages prove that the idea embodied in the dvandva
was as dead at their time as the linguistic feeling; they are mere quota
tions, made worse instead of better, from old literature. The necessary
conclusion is: the genuine dvandva is pre-Zoroastrian and with it the
verses in which it appears.
Duchesne’s observation confirms at the same time the identity, long
since surmised, but contested by A. Hillebrandt still in 1925 (zii), of
Varuna and AhuraMazdah: mi^ra-ahura is the OIr. form of Ar. and
Ved. mitra-varuna (see under ‘Deva’).
It disproves furthermore Nyberg’s assertion, 59: “die alten echten
Stiicke des Yt. 10 lassen keinen Zweifel daran, dass Ahura Mazdah
urspriinglich nichts in Mithras Umgebung zu schaffen hatte.” At the
beginning of a hymn addressed to Mithra alone, the dvandva, which
unites the two and with them sun, moon and stars, proves the contrary
:
Hymns to single gods started, in the Old Iranian and already in the
Aryan epoch, with an invocation of all the gods. The heroes of the old
epics, too, which were not members of different sects, pray—as Yt.5, 9,
4 Duchesne applies Bencemste’s theory bsos 1936: Stir quelqttes dvandvas avestiques.



MITHRA 425
15 and 17 amply show—equally to Anahita, Rtis, Druvaspa and Vayus.
The axiom, 24!:.—“Es reicht nicht aus, von vorzarathustrischer
Religion zu sprechen, man muss mit mehreren ausserzarathustrischen
Religionsformen rechnen, die allesamt im Lauf der Zeit von der
Gemeinde des Gatha-Propheten aufgesogen wurden, aber friiher ein
mal selbstandig zu denken sind”—is faulty. Polytheism is not a multi
tude of religions, but one, and its gods were, as Herodotus says, the
heaven, Mithra, sun, moon, stars—all in Y/. 10, 145—and others, that are
the old IE. “heavenly ones” or deva.
“Pre-Zoroastrian” is a relative date. If one admits the fixing of the
“traditional date” of Zoroaster in 570-500 b.c., it would mean “before
540 b.c.” But without any reference to other lines of argument, the
relative date can be converted into an absolute one from the verses of
Yt.io alone.
St. 1 13, with mi#ra-ahura, belongs to a song, to which one must
attribute the st. 28, 38, 42, 80, 85-86 and 112, and to which one may give
the title “Theft of the Herd.” Of these stanzas, 42 is evidently the
first, for it describes the general situation, leading in medias res. It
would however be too abrupt an opening for a song, and one must
assume that a general invocation of Mithra, after the model of 145,
and a special call for help, e.g. st.23, prefaced it:

Sequence of verses
:
As we have the yasht, none of the stanzas of this song any longer
joins another, and the original order is not preserved. However, the
joints between them and their younger surroundings have not been
effaced.
Some interpolations are unmistakable, e.g. in 38: “(the dwellings)
in which live the mi^radru^s and drugvant, the killers of the true
believers,” and yet the very mifhadruxs are those who destroy those
houses. Or 85b, where the cow stands “ustana.zasta, hands out
stretched” in the attitude of Zoroastrian prayer. Elimination makes the
verses metrical. In 86h one may insert gam before vesmanda, instead
of the meaningless drujo, because the fern, azyamnam follows and the
verse stands in parallel with gaus pantam azate in 38d, and gaus vrta
azyamna in 85a. rtahya pati pantam between fra.rvesayati and vesmanda
must be omitted, as mazdayasnian misinterpretation of that pantam
azate: religious problems are out of question in these verses.
The thought of st.23 is transposed into a relative clause in 22, and
there, instead of anzahibyo, an infantile repetition of anzahat in
plural, stand the words apa ffyajahat barati. In the archaic invocation
of 145, mifha-ahura are called a#yajaha. Therefore, anzahibyo in 23 is
unauthentic, ftyajahat in 22 is genuine, and the line in 23 must be cor
rected accordingly.
St.4'2 must be placed before, not after 38, because 85 joins 38. That
they followed one another is confirmed by the fact that only then



MITHRA
428
mytr’(y)t in 42c—incomprehensible as the stanzas appear in the
yasht—finds an explanation: me#ana, “farmyards” of the me#aniya
in 38b, see below.
The two words gauscit ya are reckoned to st.85, all the rest to 86, an
indication that the old song has been torn apart: (85) 86 followed
immediately upon 42-38. The contact between 85 and 103 is without
objection as to the contents, is recommended by the formal responsion
of kaSa no apayat in 85 and taSa no jamyat in 113, further by the two
avahe, and is proved by the fact that the verb jamyat stands in sin
gular. Tedesco drew my attention to the point that Duchesne’s transla
tion “que viennent” would require the dual jamyatam. But if 113
joined 85, the singular is right: the foregoing verses speak of Mithra
alone, but are followed by an invocation of the pair, mi^ra-ahura, as
in 145 the invocation of the same pair precedes the singular miffram
yazamade.
In 113c, when the stanzas were severed, a “yat” had to be inserted
before “brzam vacam” which impairs sense and meter: the gods do
not bring help “when, after” the battle was in full swing, but the
battle is hoped for as effect of their arrival. The optative mood is
abandoned only in soire, 3-p.ind. perf.med., in st.8o. This sentence
follows, meaningless, upon the equally meaningless “Mit Dir als
Herrn erwerbe ich mir ja die beste Gemeinschaft!” (Bartholomae).
Originally, st.113 joined, for only then the words jata paffyante fravrsa
in 80 and soire ,apivi#isi‘ jata in 80, otherwise wholly enigmatical, ex
plain each other mutually.
Therewith the position of st.8o is fixed. It expresses thanks for the
help of the gods. It fits the peculiar situation that Mithra is invoked,
not as usual as dahyupatis, but as “me#anapatis, vrzanahartar, lord of
the farmyard, guardian of the village.” In 42, the horses are carried
away from the me#ana, in 38 the inhabitants of the me#ana are without
shelter. Therefore, st.28 belongs behind 80, because it describes
Mithra’s activity as me^anapatar, and says that Mithra gives “herds of
cattle and men” to the house, the family—nmana—where he is obeyed.
St. 1 12, again, must follow 8, because acarati describes Mithra’s labor
as a metic, abicaris, at the me#ana. The paths of the pastures, there,
are called “deep, jafra” in contrast to the “stony, xrumiya, way” which
the stolen cattle is forced to go; and in opposition to the theft of the



MITHRA 429
horses in 42 and the robbing of the cattle in 38 and 86, the last words
say: “cattle and men travel according to their own will.” This puts
friyana in 112a close to xsnut in 28L, and the two words appear to
gether at all other places.
Vocabulary:
Bartholomae and Lommel wanted to abstract a vocative mi#ra
from mytr’t in 42,5 although the god is already twice and suf
ficiently invoked in the short stanza. On the contrary, an abla
tive “from where” the cattle is driven “to the drnahu” of the
robbers is lacking. In 86 the aim is called vesmanda, an archaic
form, Gr. otnaSe. So one expects here olnodev, and since the
whole song speaks of a me#ana, mytr’t must be regarded as
misspelling of mytn’t, me#anat.
Xruma, xrumiya appears only once more, Y/.i3,38 as xruma
asobis frazyanta, that is in the same phrase. I. Ghershewitz, in
jras 1942, 101, derived, with Henning’s assent, Sogd. ywrm,
Man.Mir. xyrm, var.lect. xrvm> be. “earth” as material, from
Aw. ‘xruma in paxruma < 'upaxruma, Vid. 2,23; same mean
ing as “upa.sma, on the earth,” see under ‘Ardvisura.’ He could
have chosen xruma itself in Y^.io,38, which does not belong to
“xru, blood” ( Wb.). xrutniya, as quality of the way is the con
trast to the “deep, Jafra, grassy” pasture, the cattle is used to
follow, cahrahaxs; hence, xrumiya means “earthy” in the sense
of “sandy” or “stony.” xruma is loc. or instr. of the noun, “in or
to earth” meaning “to the ground,” NP. “ba zamin rast kar
dan.” The houses were built of mud-bricks or stamped earth.
me#aniya:me#ana = nmaniya:nmana, they are “the people of
the farm.” The other passages in which the word occurs, Y.2,
16 = 6,15, are not i n contradiction, an.asita, then, is “without
shelter,” not “uninhabitable,” cf. duzita, ahvarta and other par
ticiples of the same class.
drna: something in which the robbers either dwell or keep
their cattle, “dauru.upa.darna” in Vid. 8,1 is made of wood and
called a “house”; Vid.3,31 quotes, out of context, a fragment:
satam patistananam, hazahram pati.daranam, where the syn.
5 Codd. Fi, E mi^raSa, others mi 0rai$a, miflraita: K15 mi#rat, Jio miflraide; leading to archet. mytr’t.



MITHRA
patistana means “stand,” place or basis. The correspondence of
the names Usi.dam “house of dawn” and Usi.darna shows that
the word was not a contemptible one; it designates a primitive
form, for instance “hut,” else “pen, corral.”
asru azano is probably to be read, with Lommel, Vast 71,n.,
+zazano; anu zafano is hardly a compound; with exception of
anu.pi#wa, all compounds with the prep, anu are late abstr.
nouns formed from verbs, anu belongs to takahe, the form of
which remains obscure Wb.: “gen.absol.”—but the meaning is
clear.
fra.rvesayati in 85 relates to the herd in stampede, and the cow
is “patismaramna, counting” the herd, as the animals in Yr.8
“count by Tistriya.”
The line with hunavo guru.zo#ranam is not so sure as it
looks; for the preceding line is corrupt and its last word taSa
might be the first of the next one. Bartholomae: “die Sohne
derer, deren Weihgiisse zahfliissig sind, scil. weil sie aus Blut
bestehen” attaching guru to *garu, fem.yru “heavy,” Gr. barys,
Lat. gravis. It is clearly an invective, like “ibn al-kalb, son-oha
bitch” etc., cf. spaci^ra, huci#ra, Akk. zer.mandu, zer halgati.
The second element, therefore, is surely go#ra, Ved. gotra,
“kind, kin,” MP.NP. gohr. In guru I can recognize neither the
word for an animal nor for whore. Gr. barys and Lat. can have
the connotation “difficult, onerous,” even “adverse,” but it is
much more probable that the two initials, g and z have changed
place: +zuru.go 0ra, cf. OP. zurakara, Aw. zurajata etc.
fravrsa: Wb. “skalpiert?” must describe the position of the
slain enemies, Jata pa#yante. If it belongs to “vrsa, hair” it would
be “the hair up,” i.e. lying on their face. It is useless to try to
explain ,api vi#isi‘ from the context in which it appears today.
Of the two words which precede, mi#radrujo martiyakaho, the
second is dispensable. Whether one makes the caesura before or

eliminating mi#radrujo—after ,api vi#isi‘, the word cannot
have had more than four syllables, and was probably only one
word. It stands between “soire, they lie” and “jata, slain,” and
can only describe—like fravrsa, close to it in 113—the position
of the dead. In analogous descriptions MP. uses often the words



MITHRA 431
“akar, incapable of acting” or “aboS, unconscious, powerless.”
The archetype ’p.v.tys(y) may be resolved (with t for 8, nor

pati: Bartholomae saw in the two pati an ellipsis for pati[s.
hartar] nis.hartar and patif.patar] ni.patar, a clumsy construc
tion resulting in an unpleasant double genitive. Lommel takes
pati as vocative, avoiding these disadvantages. mefianahya pads
and vrzanahya pads are dissected compounds *me#anapatis and
Vrzanapatis, like ^sa^rahya pads in Y.44,9 and soi^rahya pads
in y.2,16.
brzi.mita “high-built,” to Vmay-, mi-, OP. framay “to con

propped wood-constructions, see under ‘Architecture.’
krnavati, to Vkart-, to cut, stone or wood; the antae are of
wood, in the large scale of Achaemenian buildings of stone. OP.

point from which all significations depart: character. The word

The picture of the civilization disclosed in this song is very archaic.
The people live by cattle-breeding, dwell in houses, nmana, with col
umns and a(n)fiya, “antae,” the IE. domus in antis, on farms and in
6 Cod. H4 \i0is, M12 Jio vi0a:S, leads to archet. ’p.v.tysy, with indistinct number and position of yY

villages. In st.8o some titles are poetically transformed (like sastar in
st.108 etc.) : the me#anahya patis is nipata, hence *mef?anapati or
*me#anapatar; 7 the vrzanahya patis is nishartar, hence *vrzanapati or
‘vrzanahartar (in Y.46,1, see under ‘Social Structure’). Mithra acarati,
works like an abicaris, he timbers and cuts, krnavati, the antae like a
Median krnvaka. Aliens, anya and mifhadruxs, who do not worship
Mithra, come on chariots, raid and destroy the village, wound and slay
the men, drive off the cattle and horses. It is difficult to make a stamped
ing herd turn: fra.rvesaya. But at the end it says: “Cattle and men
travel vaso.xsadra, in freedom!”
The same picture of civilization is the background of the oath the
aryaman, client, swears when entering a vis, in Y.12,2-3, see under ‘Fra
varani’ : the new member forswears cattle-stealing, grazing of pastures,
destruction of immobile property, bodily injury and manslaughter of
the members of the vis; he allows the right of the maniya, meflaniya of
Yt. 10, who live by cattle-breeding, to rove freely as nomads or to settle
freely, vaso.yatim, vaso.sitim, words that at once recall the sitayo
frazyante and pasu vira vaso.xsa#ra fracarate of our song. Both lead
back to the seventh century, when the immigration of the Aryans
gradually came to a standstill.
The figure of the “lamenting cow” connects the song with Zoroaster’s
“Cow-gatha” Y.29. This subject must have been one of pre-Zoroastrian
poetry. But the difference is apparent: here all is a condensed, epic
description of an event; in Zoroaster’s gatha the cow philosophizes. The
time interval is hardly more than a century, short for the degree of
change. This is the effect of a great personality: the song is naive, the
gatha over-refined.
The character of the language accords with the high antiquity of the
song. About one fifth of all occurring words are hapax legomena, or a
fourth part if one includes words that recur only once more in late
passages. Moreover, the song must have been well known, for some of
its verses were imitated already at an early period.
The verse with xruma sitayo frazyante appears again in Yt. 13,38 in
the epic fragment about the Danavo, in the shape
Xruma asobis frazyanta danunam bevar.patmam
T Cf. MP. n.pr. patrok mehan < *pa0ra.me0ana, under ‘Last Judgment.’



MITHRA 433
with asah for siti, and in the instr. pi. as “general plural case” according
to the late date: the Danavo are a historical family of Vistaspa’s time,
and their legend must have been formed and embodied into the epics
in the fifth century b.c., whence it was taken over into Yt. 13 by the
redactors of the Awesta.
Also 17.10,30 is formed after st.28 of the old song:
tuvam srogana srora^a Thou, fair ? women, fair ? chariots,
nistrta.spaya niSata.barzisa out-spread carpets, laid-down mat
tresses,
nmana masita daSahi thou givest to the grand houses,
tuvam sroganam srora^am thou, . . . women, . . . chariots,
nistrta.spayam niSata.barzisam . . . carpets, . . . mattresses,
nmanam daSahi brzimitam thou givest to the high-built house,
yas.#wa oxta.namana yasna of him who worships thee with
yasna with-mention-of-thy-name
ra#wiya vaca yazate and with prayer at the fixed hour!
The poor poet started from the second half, with singularic nmana
and adj. brzimita, borrowed from st.28; for the first half he put nmana
in plural, with adj. masita, deriv. of “mas, great.” A more detailed
description of a house with carpets, mattresses and other furniture, in
Y/.14—see under ‘Hospitium’—belongs in the high Achaemenian epoch,
the fifth century. This one is of the fourth century: the words oxtana
man (see under ‘Return of the Gods’) and rafhviya vaca are as good as
a dated signature of the poet. Instead of “herds of cattle and men” he
wants only women, rugs and mattresses.
The verses 10,145, with the dvandva mi#ra-ahura are placed near the
end of the yasht, cut off from all original connections by a number of
inferior stanzas, but are the beginning of an old hymn. Upon the in
vocation of Mithra, Ahura, stars, moon and sun, a hymn addressed to
Mithra alone followed. The same invocation, therefore, is an introduc
tion adequate for a hymn to each of these gods, the pre-Zoroastrian
Ahura, Tistriya, Hvar xseta and Mah. Here it opens a hymn to Mithra
dahyupatis, of which much, if not all, is preserved.

Connection of stanzas:
yim yazante dahyupatayo in 8a resumes dahyupatim yazamade in
i45f., and is resumed by yim yazante ra^estaro in na. Between the in
vocation of 145 and st.8 a number of epithets are required: st.25, 103 and
1 12 contain epithets only. Ignoring the trivial and unmetrical, they
give 6 verses, among them ahura, vispatis and thrice ra^estar, and the
sequence “dahyupatis, 145—raflestar, epithets—dahyupatayo, 8—ra#es
taro, n” confirms the arrangement.



MITHRA 437
St.8 describes the situation: the army, gone west, faces the enemy,
lined up in phalanges. St_47a and 48 repeat this description word by
word, hence belong to the same poem. St.47a “yim frasrutam”—not
“den beriihmten” (Bartholomae and Lommel) but “praised in song”
by the dayupatayo and ra#estaro of 8 and n at their yasna, with causa
tive connotation : the songs of these worshippers arouse the gods’ wrath
towards the enemy, frasrutam connects 47 inseparably with the fore
going 8 and 11.
prdu.safaho in 47b “with broad hooves,” since no horses are men
tioned before, must have had support in the following stanzas; it intro
duced the description of the chariot, preserved in st.68, which is to be
discussed in full later on. This again was joined by the description of
the weapons on the chariot, st.128-131.
Though full of tiresome repetitions and interpolations, two old glosses
admitted into the text prove the still higher antiquity of this descrip
tion. Bartholomae, Wb.875, recognized that the words, six times re
peated “ethereal they (the weapons) travel, ethereal they fall on the
skulls of the deva,” do not fit a bow, where they appear first. They fit
nowhere, and their interpolation, breaking the continuity of the simple
sentence, entails seven repetitions of the introductory formula. Also
“hukrta, well-fabricated,” repeated behind every single weapon, makes
sense only in the first place, only as epithet of the bow, which was a
composite one. The old gloss, there, says : “asti yo gavasnahya snavya jiya,
there are such with strings of stag’s tendons.”
The introductory formula “histate aom vartahe hazahram . . .” is
prosaic and ungrammatical; an “aom with genitive” does not exist.
“On the chariot lie a thousand” would be “histate varte hazahram,”
which is metrical. Thereupon the weapons were enumerated in the
gen.pl., correct in grammar and correct or easily corrected in meter.
The never-ending verses in the yasht reduce themselves to the eight lines
admitted in our text. For all details of the weapons see under ‘Indus
tries.’
St.48 is a modern single number for two old stanzas. In the first
Mithra drives out, in the second the enemies break bodily down. This
is not the effect of Mithra’s starting, but of terror. Therefore, the place
of st.101, with “para-jasati, he arrives” and “#rahayati, he causes terror”
is between 48, a and b. Meter and sequence of the verses of st.101 are



MITHRA
438
disturbed. As we have it, the shooting of the arrows—with “hama#a,
Wb.\ gleichmassig verteilt er”—precedes the brandishing of the club,
which the god “prvyo nijati, swings down first (masc.).” The gaSa
(fem.) is Mithra’s vazra; the two are not distinguished {Wb.) as club
for throwing and for striking. The comparative prvyo, m., does not
mean “he is the first to wield a club,” but “he uses first his specific
weapon,” and right after it, hamai9a, the arrows. It follows that the
description of the club in the hand of the god, in st.96, must have had
its place before st.101, in which it is used. Indeed, 96 fits perfectly
to 48a, and there is no other description of the vazra and nowhere else
does the Awesta speak of its use. In st.132 the whole description is liter
ally repeated, introduced by “on the chariot lies . . but the vazra
was not a piece of the arsenal on the chariot: when angry, Mithra
carries it in his hand, when peaceful, he comes “uzbazus, with hands
high,” st. 124, and the club does not lie ready to hand that he might dis
appoint his worshippers at any moment.
St.48'0 is part of the description of the terror, which begins in 101,
and since 48a ends with “he frightens both, horse and man,” the verses
describing the fright of the horses came first.8 At that place verses are
inserted coming from a soldier’s incantation, parts of which are pre
served elsewhere:
apasi vazati rstis
yam ahyati avi.mi^ris
yatcit huvastam ahyati
vato tam rstim barati
with the gloss
:
yatcit tanum apayati though it may hit the body,
atcit dim noit rasayante they do not wound him!
St.20 begins, in the yasht, with (aspa)cit, a conjunction disturbing the
meter, and which was added in order to fit the stanza into its secondary
8 The “Letter of franchise,” granted to RittiMarduk by Nebuchadnezzar I (1146-1123),
L. W. King, Kudurru n° \i, coi.i,1.2of. says, describing the battle with the Elamites: “ni.is.qu sa rabutil'1 iEJPl it ta.si.iz.zu u sa ed.h qar.di pu.ri da.su it.tu.ru, the splendor of the great horses stood still, and the legs of the strong man turned aside.” “Splendor” is no true translation of nisqu, and puridasu itturu mas be a strong sulgar expression. NaramSin says something to the contrary: “faisant tourner en arriere la poitrine.”

MITHRA 439
context. When 20 is placed behind 101, this -cit is unnecessary, and the
meter is right.
Upon the terror of the horses, first st.39 followed, describing the
weapons becoming inefficient. There (isvas)cit is metrically correct
and connects 39 adequately with 20. The present surroundings led astray
Bartholomae, who attached the verb mi^nati to V mit- “bleiben,” trans
lating: “sofern Mithra beleidigt bleibt, nicht willkommen geheissen”;
Lommel: “wenn M. (es) vereitelt”; it belongs to V mi#-, not “mittere”
(Wb.) but “repousser” (Benveniste). ya#a is causative, “because.” “a.pa
tizanto not-recognized,” with a- reversing the sense, “despised,” full
syn. of “offended.”
St.40 possibly contains something old, but if so, not in the good con
dition as st.39:
kartacit hufrayu^ta the knives, too, the well-suspended,
vazracit hunivixta the vazra, the well-tossed ones,
yoi niyrare./sarahi martiyakanam that are brought down upon the
heads of the men,
asarnno.jano bavati miss their target.
St.qSb: the terror, fMhayati, of the god “veils the eyes,” i.e. blinds,
“makes blunt the ears,” deafens the enemies, who become unable to hold
their legs straight, Homer’s ra yowara \veip. St.36 pictures the effect
:
the phalanxes, called “ham.yanta, closed” in 8, 47 and 48, are shaken
and break. The hapax x r^hayati in 36d—Ir. Vxrah-, AS. hrorjan,
Germ, riihren, to be stirred, raked (ZAirWb.164 ) —rhymes with 0raha
yati. Thus st.36, the end of the tale, is closely linked to its beginning in
st.8.
In the yasht, st.37 follows, a very bad stanza, but containing two cor
rect verses:
para kamrSa spayati he s the skulls,
para kamrSa vazanta off fly the skulls
If old, these verses can hardly have had another place than in this poem,
and very inferior stanzas may always preserve small fragments, splints
of old songs.
Finally the conclusion which is preserved in two versions:



MITHRA
440
10,69: moi.tu iflra ahurahya
grantahya ve-yai jasema
yahya hazahram veyanam
pad hamr#ai jasati
10,98: ma mi^rahya vurugavyutois
grantahya ve-yai Jasema
ma no granto api.janya
mi#ro yo vurugavyutis
Both deficient stanzas reflect the same original. In 69a the first words
are corrupt; no use trying to interpret them. But the designation
“ahura” of Mithra is too archaic for the time of the redaction, would be
veritably offensive. In 98, on the other hand, the epithet vurugavyutois
is unmetrical, hence a mazdayasnian substitute for genuine ahurahya,
and one must combine “ma miffrahya ahurahya,” which agrees with
the invocation mi#ra-ahura in st.25; the use of the archaic epithet ahura
for Mithra in the Awesta is therewith limited to this song. The idea
of st.69 “who has a thousand veya” is a cliche, unfit for ve-ya, which
is a movement, see under ‘Eranvez’; the corresponding line in 98 is
good. The phrase is optative, therefore the very last line must be the
obligatory vocative. That gives a convincing end: “The fate of our
enemies may never strike ourselves!” The inscription Dar.Pers.f (only
Elamite) ends similarly: “hupe anni sisne hupe appo Ruh.irra harikki
lammamanra, Never may hit us what the enemy devises!”
Vocabulary:
St.145: rtavan, as epithet of Mithra and Ahura, is used in
its pre-Zoroastrian meaning—as also when epithet of the fra
varti—with rtam as “mores, law.”
rarest! and ratfestar appear here side by side; considering the
high age of the song, raflestar cannot be a late neologism. In
st.n the raflesta are driving hitebyo, a two-horse team, biga.
To astra.had, see under ‘Yama xseta.’
For the meter of 8, a cf. Y/.io,i3: yahmiya garayo brzanto:
both verses have an odd syllable and both a plural in -ayo. In
10,13 one could save one syllable by reading +yahmi or "brzo,
but our knowledge of the meter is not enough to solve even
such simple problems.
To 8b: The codd. have arzahe, or -hi, which Wb. separates
from arzah “Abend,” arzahi (dual) “west,” connecting it with
m. “arza, battle” as a n. arzah-. Yt. 19,42, where the word recurs,
is inconclusive : an adversary of Krsaspa called arza.samana “sets



MITHRA 44 1
out for battle, gato arzahe.” Whether “battle” or “west,” this
is an etiological play with the name, ’rzsmn may be a patron, of
*arzasma, like mrzismya in 17.13,126 of Tnrzisma, cf. fra.sma
etc. But the ambiguous gato arzahe may also be directly influ
enced by arzahe Jasanto in Yr.10,8.
Xrusyatis in st.8, 47 and 48 is trisyllabic, ^tusyantahya in 36
counts for five syllables, but the them. gen. arouses suspicion:
the original text may have had xrusyato and a lost word of
two syllables. The verse gives the impression of being authentic;
if an interpolation, the two preceding lines must be reversed.
Xrusyant appears still in Yr.15,49, quotation from 10,8; in Yt.
19,54 similarly; in Y.9,30 entirely bad; all to be discounted for
determining the meaning. If it were genuine as epithet of the
fravarti in Yr.13,33, it could not mean “bloodthirsty.” Wb.,
doubting: “denom. part, of *xrvis-P”, i.e. IE. krewos, Gr.
Kpkfas, OE. hreaw > raw (meat). The form recalls a partiut.
like sosyant, or a denom. like ranxsyant, ranxsayant. Future
tense would make it an apt epithet for the fravarti and would fit
here: “who set about for bloodshed, battle.” Or xr6syant,
Xrusyant to Vxrus-P
To 20: vazyanstra, said of horses, corresponds to asamna.vid
in 39, of the weapons that become inefficient; the next three
verbs with negation detail the notion. It must mean “restive,
storrisch,” similar to Bartholomae’s translation. The three verbs
have so far not been satisfactorily determined;9
I assume they
indicate the three gaits of the horses.
Just as the Danavo verses in Yt. 13,38 are composed on the model of
Y/. 10,38, thus Y/.io,i 1 served as model for Yr.5,58, verses dating from
the Achaemenian period, see under ‘Notarya.’ The offering and prayer
of the ra^esta “at the necks” of their horses shows them dismounted,
standing in ranks, holding the bridles of their team with their right
hand near the horses’ head.
9 I belie\e there is an explanation, unknown to me, by Geiger. Etymology alone can hardly reveal the very specific significations. A similar case is Sargon’s description ot the remounting
m Urartu, on the Urmiya Lake, 8th Camp. Li 73: “asu sihru u taru, simat tahazi,” ThureauDangin translates “sortie, volte et derm-tour, ce qui convient au combat”; Luckenbill: “going forward, turning to one side, or turning around, as the (tactics of) battle require.”



MITHRA
442
The description of the weapons in 129-131—see under ‘Industries’

agrees with others in 39-40, and in Yt. 13,7. But it agrees also with the
armament of the Persians at the review of Doriscus, 480 b.c., which, as
Herodotus remarks, was “properly speaking the Median equipment.”
arzahi in st.8 shows that the poet imagined the enemy to be in the
west. This concept was natural for Iranians from the time of their
immigration to the fall of Nineveh and Babylon, hence for 400 years,
and we shall find verses that define time and place more accurately.
I intercalate here a passage from the Tistriya Yt.8, because it con
tained once, like the old songs of the Mihr-yasht, an invocation of
Mithra-Ahura in dvandva form. It is an epic fragment of the R^sa
myth, twice interpolated into st.6-7 and 37-38 of the Tistriya yasht.
“rysa, to Mark-, to shine,” is Tistriya transformed into a hero, like
Apavrta into Frahrasya, Vrthragna into Krsaspa; thereby background
and interpretation of the story are determined.
“We bring offerings to Tistriya . .

Because it serves as comparison for the speed of the star, this fragment
of the Rxsa myth has been preserved:10

clearly than elsewhere, what has been changed of the original text and
what is a parasitical growth. The greatest divergence is in the lines:

pari se vurugavyutis mi#ro vurugavyutis (he) mi0ro

In 38 the archaic dual fracesetam is outstanding, which must
have had a dual subject. Therefore, translators have suppressed
the Amrta Spanta; but one must equally suppress the apa urvara
in st.7. The attributes mazda to ahuro and vurugavyutis to
mi#ro are likewise too much, avgn, which Wb. takes as a 3-sg.
pret. act., ava + V an- “to blow at,” ought to be a dual, and is
hardly a verb at all. Since a pair is helping, it is probably ava =
uba “both,” often used with a dvandva. If in the fragment of an
old myth ahura and mi0ra are the subject of a dual verb, the
grammatical form must have been the dvandva mi#ra-ahura.
pouru pantam is in Wb.855 put under “paru, much” with the
peculiar sense “weithin”; but in st.7 it is pari, adv. used for in
tensifying the sense of verbs with fra-, which one must prefer to
the improbable “pouru.” What remains is the metrical verse
put in our text.

be linked to MP.NP. “xbst, track, trail, highway.” Hertel reads sitat,
to si-, “to dwell,” which would make arya.sitam similar to arya.saya
nam, believing that the shot went from “Iran” to heaven. The Huvan

Agbatana. This identification is assured by the correspondence of

At the same time of these verses, the hero Rxsa was long since separated
from the star Tistriya, and though in the original myth the shot may
have been aimed at the heaven, in this form of the legend the places
were already located on earth. The movement ought to be—like that of
the star—from east to west, and if the huvanvant is an Alwand pass,
arya.xsutfa ought to be a corresponding point farther east, e.g. the Awah
pass or the Caspian Gates.
Y^.io,i45 contains a second formula of great interest, namely vis
panam dahyunam dahyupatis, lit. ruler-of-the-country of all countries,
i.e. sovereign.
This title in pre-Zoroastrian verses disproves the reason adduced by
Meillet, Trois Conf. 22, against the identification of the historical and
the Awestic Vistaspa: “L’etablissement d’un vast empire, gouverne par
un roi absolu, a ete dans le monde indo-iranien un fait d’un type nou
veau; il est sans doute resulte de ces memes mouvements auxquels est
due la secte zoroastrienne,” and 24: “Le trait caracteristique de l'epoque
achemenide, c’est le chef supreme, le xsayatfya xsayaflyanam des inscrip
tions, le /foonAeus par excellence des Grecs. Les gathas ne savent rien
d un pared chef qui est, en effet, un personnage tout nouveau parmi
les Aryens. ... II n y a, des lors, aucune raison de croire que le Vistaspa
qui a protege Zoroastre ait rien de commun avec Vistaspa, pere de
Darius.”
When Meillet wrote these sentences, the gathas were generally
acknowledged to be older than any other parts of the Awesta, although
he himself had more than once established Awestic idioms more archaic
than in the Gathic dialect. Medlet’s argument stands and falls with this
assumption. If the gathas are not older than the really old hymns, the
argument does not disprove, but proves the contrary thesis.
This other conception was first discussed, with detail, by A. Christen
sen, who wrote:12 “Les remarques critiques de M. Herzfeld (ami i,
i26ff.) m’ont engage a reexaminer la question de la composition des
yashts Les ‘grands’ yashts . . . sont des restes dune poesie religieuse

Les hymnes sont empruntes a une poesie . . . qui existait auparavant.
. . . II ne s’ensuit pas que les parties originales des yashts soient pre
gathiques, mais je crois pas qu’on puisse en nier la possibility. . . . Les
yashts originaux . . . n’etaient guere destines a l’origine, a servir de
textes liturgiques.” Christensen, at that time, could not yet make up his
mind to accept my perception, still entirely immature: All really old
parts of the yashts, songs like those studied so far and many more, are
pre-Zoroastrian. There is scarcely any problem not touched and changed
by this recognition. Yasht and Yasna have three, if one wants four
strata: pre-Zoroastrian songs, the gathas of Zoroaster, the Y. Haftahati
and the late-Awestic liturgical chapters.
But apart from all this, if one calls—as Meillet does—the traditional
date of Zoroaster “precis et plausible,” and if one accepts the fact that
he lived at the close of the Median epoch, then, at any rate, dahyu
contains the notion of satrapy of the Median and later the Persian
empire. [The two stems in the inflection of OP. dahyu indicate that
the word was taken over from the Median official language.] In Meil
let’s conception of the chronology, too, the title vispanam dahyunam
dahyupatis contains the “fait d’un type nouveau,” the union of many
satrapies in one empire, not as a hope, but as a projection of worldly
facts into myth.
In a fragment of the Husravah legend, preserved in Yt.5,49 (-Yt. 15,
3t-33) we read:
,arsa‘ aryanam dahyunam hankrmo husrava
a simple looking, difficult passage.
Darmesteter translated doubtingly: “the hero who united the Aryan
nations into one kingdom”; Bartholomae: “Held der arischen Lander,
Befestiger des Reichs”; Lommel: “der mannhafte unter den arischen
Volkern, der Einiger der Herrschaft.”
han.krmo is a hapax, and as verb ham + kar- appears only in the very
late Y.i: han.karayami, governing a dative. Bartholomae makes light
of the dative “for genitive.” hankaraya means “put down to somebody’s
account,” cf. under ‘Arithmetics.’ The same way of expression is familiar
to Assyrian,13 where “manu, to count among,” is the term for “to make
13 Also in Hittite, e.g. treaty between Suppduliuma of Khatti and Tette, kbo. 1.4, I.43: “from mount Niblani (Lebanon) and from the western banks of the Euphrates 1 have counted the countries to my domain.”



MITHRA
446
one’s own, to give as possession, to make subject to,” applied to con
quered countries, peoples, prisoners of war, booty etc. “ana nise matiia
amnusunuti I counted them among the people of my country,” or “I
counted for the service of the god Assur” is the term for “I made the
country a province.” The same is valid for “xsa#rai hankrmo, who has
counted it for the xsa^ram, made it a province of the xsa#ram.” The
gen. aryanam dahyunam, hence, can only be gen.obj. to xsa#ram: “the
empire of the Aryan provinces.” ham.karaya is used without acc.obj.,
which is yasna, to be supplied from the context; likewise, hankrmo
is used with dative obj. only, to which the acc. dahyus must be borrowed
from dahyunam.14 Thus, the verse says: “he who counted (the prov
inces) among the empire of the Aryan provinces,” i.e. made them
subject.
At the parallel passage in Y/.15,31-32 we read: “To him (Vayu) the
dahyupatis Arvasara brought offerings at the White Forest, praying:
Grant me this success: that Husravah shall not slay us two ( ? na, dual),
he who subjected (the provinces) to the provinces of the Aryan empire,
(and) that I (sg.) may overwhelm him! (But) Kavi Husravah killed
him in the All-Aryan-Forest.” This is a very poor imitation of older
genuine verses of the epics, and yet it cannot be younger than the fifth
century b.c.15 The remark on “Husravah hankrmo” anticipates what
was achieved only by his victory over Arvasara. There ought to be
verses in which Husravah’s prayer to the contrary is granted by the
god, while he rejects Arvasara’s prayer. Husravah represents the his
torical Cyrus. Xenophon is the first to mention these popular songs.
Cyrus was a Persian, but the localities of his legend, the various “forests,
arzura, rzura > lur” are all to be looked for in Luristan and Shahrazur,
in Media, because there are no “lur,” i.e. the term for the typical “karst
vegetation,” in eastern Iran. The legend remembers the fact that it was
Cyrus who conquered Media. It is most striking that the adversary of
14 arsa loses its importance; it possibly is the lacking acc. object, acc.n.sg. or pi., scarcely masc. n.sg. of “arsan, male” in the sexual meaning. Even when accepting “hero,” Wb., for this place and Yt. 1 9,52, 10,86, one could not say “hero among the countries,” only “among men,” but it nowhere means “hero.” In Yt. 10.86 the lamenting cow invokes the god Mithra as “the bull”; in 19,52, ApamNapat is arsan as the “sire of nar, men.” The main support for this theory, xsaya.arsam “stallion among rulers” is totally wrong, it is -arsah-. Possibly, this arsah, and n.pr. (vahmayat)arsa- belong to the adv. rs, ars. 15 What follows is worse : “Thereupon he granted to him that success, he, . . . Vayu, in order that he, the creator AhuraMazdah, should partake of the success.”



MITHRA 447
the hero bears a title like dahyupatis; it is the historical title of the
Median great-kings, faithfully preserved.16
One more expression, in a fragment without relation, Yt.10,4, is in
timately connected with these titles
:
midram . . . ramasayanam . . . aryabyo dahyubyo
ramasayana is also epithet of Tistriya. In Vid.i the role is transferred
to AhuraMazdah. Applied to a king it designates him as the “ideal ruler
who brings an era of bliss,” see Y.53,8 under ‘Bandva.’ Whether ramsahr
(e kaivistaspsah) in Ayat\.Zar. §63 is the title of Vistaspa or a place
name is not quite clear.17 But the Sasanids Yazdegird I and Varhran V
called themselves, on their coins—as here Mithra—“bag e ramsahr, the
god, the one who gives the land peace,” and Xusrau I bears the title
eipT)voTrdTpLO<; i.e. ramsahr in his protocol in Menander, de Leg. n, §3;
Theophylakt says dpr)vdpxr)‘;d a Cyrus says, as do Assyrian kings before
him, “I made the countries live in peace.” The epithet of Mithra is a
great-royal honorific, that of a “ktistes.” The xsadram aryanam dahyu
nam in Yt.5,49 and with addition of upamam applied to kavi Usan
and Husravah—cf. under ‘Deva’—is the oldest form preserved of the
Achaemenian term aryanam xsadram > Eransahr.
Since the title vispanam dahyunam dahyupatis in Y/.io,i45 is older
than Zoroaster, the only reason for its absence from the gathas is that
these odes do not speak of such political concepts. Without the word of
the “tribute-money” no words of Christ would allude to Caesar and Rome.
Thus, the tide contains an immediate date: the song “Mithra as
warrior,” one of the oldest parts of the Mithra yasht, is composed at
the time of the Median empire, 678-550 b.c. The “Theft of the Herd”
belongs to the early part of that epoch or even to the very beginning of
the seventh century, vispanam dahyunam dahyupatis is the sovereign
Median title, and Mithra, thereby, is saluted—not as “Kreishauptmann”

but as sovereign ruler of Eransahr.
The immense expansion of that empire under the Achaemenids
16 The existence of legendary beside historical names may be the reason for Ctesias’ doubling Herodotus’ four Median kings. 17 Ramsahr was the name of the old capital of STstan. Hamza mentions a town RamVistaspan in Fars; Wais u Ramin 304: “today though thes call it Ahwaz, in the daftar it is still called Ramsahr.” Cf. Ramuz <f *RamHormizdArdashIr in Khuzistan.
18 Cf. AhpJnschr. 319 and 322.



MITHRA
448
caused a new tide to be derived from it, xsaya#ya xsaya^yanam, xsa
ya#ya dahyunam; but the notion of sovereignty persisted, down to the
Sasanian period, to the word dahyupatis, even after dahyu had de
scended to mean “village.” The protocols of the Buyids, Seljuks, Orto
qids, Ayyubids and Mamluks, the details of which are mainly of Persian
origin and the wealth of which allows us to follow the developments
closely, contain many perfect analogies.19
A determination yet more exact of the date is furnished by Y/.io,io4,
a stanza belonging to the song of the “Sacrilegus,” which will be
studied below:
104: yatcit usastare hindou Whether in the east on the Indus,
yatcit dosatare Ttiyre or in the west on the Tigris,
yatcit sanake ranhaya or at the sanake of the Iaxartes,
yatcit +vimaSye ahya zmo or here in the middle of this earth,
105: tamcit mi 0ro hangrfsamno wherever he be, Mithra seizes him
+pari.apayat bazuwya clasping him with his arms.
The power of the avenger has no limits, an idea also expressed by
his epithet “zam.fra^ah, as broad as the earth.” The verses want to ex
press the notion “everywhere,” and therefore reveal how far the horizon
of the poet actually reached.
In st. 19, belonging to the same song, Mithra turns in a similar way
towards the two nema, “halves of the earth,” where the mi#radruxs
expects him the least. The “middle of the earth” is part of the krsvar
notion. In 15 it is called hvanira#a, in 13 arya.sayanam, Eransahr. But
the figure of the “seven krsvar” cannot be applied in st.104, because
Mithra can drive beyond the edge of the earth, but no criminal can
escape thereto. For the same reason the fourth point, usual in such
determinations, is lacking: it is the south, the Indian Ocean, beyond
which no one can go, the “Uttermost Sea” encircling the earth. Instead
of the krsvar, therefore, the poet describes the world he knows by the
historic-geographical boundaries of the land of the middle, Eransahr.
The eastern limit is the Indus River, hindus. The initial fault of ear
lier translations is “India” for hindou. India, as name for the subcon
19 Cf. my Inscriptions et Monuments d' Alep, Materiaux pour un Corpus Inscriptionum Arabicarum.



MITHRA 449
tinent, is a Greek term. Ir. hindus is only the river and the satrapy at
its bank. On the other hand, it is only this name, and not, as Markwart
assumed, in Vehrot, at the same time appellative “river,” as in Indian.
The OP. lists of satrapies confirm Herodotus who says iv,44, that Sind
was a new conquest of Darius : the name is not yet mentioned in Behis
tun, 521 b.c., whereas Gandara, the Kophen area, and ©atagus, the Pan
)ab, are mentioned, being inherited satrapies. This again is confirmed
by the names Kurus and Kanbuzya of the elder branch of the Achae
menids, which are honorifics, received in wars against the Kuru and
Kamboja in Gandara, see under ‘Throne-names.’ The Indus and, in the
north, one of the Panjab rivers, remained the frontier between Iran and
India down to Alexander’s time. Strabo, xv,i,io, quoting Eratosthenes
b.m, says: “Between the land reckoned as India, when Alexander ar
rived there, and Ariane, which lies next to it towards the west and was
owned by the Persians, the Indus formed the boundary; later on, the
Indians owned much of Ariane, having obtained it from the Mace
donians.” And Isidorus, at the turning of our era, puts the frontier
closely behind Qandahar, above the Bolan pass.
The northern limit is equally a river, the sanaka of the Ranha.
sanake, loc., is opposed, in Yt.12, 18-19, to “up a uSesu ranhaya, at the
waters of the Ranha,” cf. under ‘Videvdad’; it is a term for a region
situated on a river, not “mouth” as Bartholomae inferred from his
assumption that ,aoSa‘ meant “source.” One may think of names, usual
in that very region, like para-Sugdam = Transoxiana, Ma-wara-l-nahr,
and cis and trans Iaxartem. Today, the land beyond the river is called
Farghana, a medieval Arab.-NP. name revived, MP. prk/g’n. an OIr.
deriv. from paraka, either a “parapotamia” or “beyond the river,” cf.
“Saka paradarya, beyond the (Black) Sea.” In the tribute list, Herodotus
111,92 (source: Hecataeus) UapiKavtoi appear at the side of ’OpOoKopv
fiaPTioi i.e. Saka tigra^dSa, and to them belong the ’Apvpyioi, Saka
Homavrga of vii,64. sanaka seems to be formed like paraka.
This northern boundary, too, was an old one. Cyrus was killed in
battle in the far east. Berossus locates the war in the “plains of the
Dahae”; Herodotus places the Tomyris legend in the land “beyond the
Iaxartes,” which is perhaps the meaning of sanake Ranhaya; according
to Ctesias it would have been the country of the Derbikes, actually
identical with Dahae, though he believes it to be towards India; but



MITHRA
450
he makes the king Amorges, i.e. the homavrga from beyond the
Iaxartes, fight on Cyrus’ side. Bartholomae remarks upon sanake ran
haya “nach Y?. 10, 104 am Ende der Erde,” which should be “at the
frontier of arya.sayanam.” One may have believed that the earth ended
not far behind it, cf. Aristides, ad Rom. xxvi,i5, who records as a Per
sian notion: ’'lavas kcu AioXea? iv Trepacri yr)’; elvai rrjs eneivov (row
yfiacriXIct)?).
The western frontier is the Tigris.
The text has niyne, at first rightly regarded as a n.pr., but wrongly
identified with Nineveh, niyne is a verbal form, but the structure of the
verses and their sense forbid, from the beginning, the translation “he
strikes down,” which results in an impossible opposition of “East- and
West-Indies.” The word can be nothing but the name of a river that
formed—as the Indus in the east, the Iaxartes in the north—the western
boundary of vimaSye ahya zmo, the Iranian horizon of the period. One
must read +tigre. 20
To indicate the extreme boundaries by four—here the fourth point
would be the Indian Ocean—points axially opposed, is a well known
scheme, already in Assyrian. On the gold tablets of Darius one reads:
“from (inclus.) the Saka [on the Iaxartes] unto Kus, from Hindus unto
Sardis.” Xenophon, Cyrop., gives this Iranian idiom a better Greek
shape: “from the Indian Ocean to the Black Sea, from Cyprus to Aethio
pia.” Aristotle, de mundo: T-ip Se o-vpiracrav apx^jv rip ’Acria? irepa
Tovpevrjv '^XkrjcnrovTov pev Ik rfjs 77/30? icnrepav pepu>v, Yi'Sw Se e/c
XT/? 77/30 ? la). The book of Esther uses a similar abbreviation, “from
Sind to Kush.”
The verses of Y£.io,ic>4 mean the same and say it in the same form,
even with the same names. The south is omitted for good reasons. In
east and north, Yt. 10 and the Darius inscriptions are conform: Hindus
and Ranha. In the west, Darius’ empire reaches far beyond the condi
tion described in Yt.io.
20 y.57,29 repeats the first two lines literally and without variants of spelling, nryne is lacking in one cod., four write ni-, one na-: the i had no notation in the archetype, cf. TGR = tigra in the Pap>rus. Early Sasanian uncial and late cursive script distinguish hardly or not at all between
N and R, and often disconnect T in Y-N. Here, moreover, the preceding word ends in -y. Therefore, Aw. nrync is tgry misread into (y)ngny. The names tigra and hufratu are Median
transformations of indigenous diqlat f Pliny NH vi,i27 Diglito, abl., from Juba or Isidorus] and purat; Beh. writes tigram, acc.fem., assimilated to Ir. tigra, arrow, Gr. tigres. The Old Med. form became regularly *tlr, Theophanes’ Qrjp Trorapos.



MITHRA 451
From the destruction of Nineveh by Cyaxares and Nabopolassar in
612, to the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus in 550 b.c., the Tigris formed
the western boundary of the Median empire.21 In the Achaemenian
empire it remained the frontier of the satrapy Media. That is why
Hecataeus, Ctesias, Xenophon, and still Eratosthenes agree in describing
the Tigris from the Armenian mountains (Kentrites, Gordyaea) to the
mouth of the Diyala (Physkos, Gyndes) as the western boundary of
the satrapy “Media and Paraitakene.” Arbela is, in Behistun, a town of
Media; the oil sources of Baba Gurgur near Kirkuk, which Alexander
admired on his way from Arbela to Opis and Babylon, were situated,
according to Plutarch, Alex. 35, “in the province of Ecbatana.” Only
by misunderstanding, one has imputed to Ctesias the statement that
Euphrates and Tigris flow towards Isfahan-Paraitakene, and has elimi
nated in Plutarch “in the province of Ecbatana”; both remarks are
right.
Y^.10,104 describes the extent of the Median empire after the fall of
Nineveh and before the conquest of Babylon. Therewith, the song of
the “Sacrilegus” to which the stanza belongs, is dated between 612 and
539 b.c. In “Mithra as warrior,” a song which, for the pre-Zoroastrian
mifha-ahura formula and the Median title vispanam dahyunam dahyu
patis, must be dated in the time of the Median empire, 678-550, the
dahyupatayo “set out towards the west, arzahi.” The contemporary
stanza 104 defines this western boundary as the Tigris. Therefore, the
song to “Mithra as warrior” reflects the historical events which we
know, seen from the west, by the Samas Omina of Esarhaddon and by
the Chronicle of the Fall of Nineveh. The old, wrong translation “niyne
= Nineveh” came nearer to the truth than the more recent “he strikes
down.”
539 b.c., the lower limit of these songs with their sovereign Median
title and the pre-Zoroastrian dvandva, is at the same time a terminus
ad or post quem for Zoroaster. This deduction has not a single point
in common with the “traditional date,” but is in keeping with our
interpretation of it to the very year: born 258 years before 311 = 569 b.c.,
appeared 30 years of age in 539 b.c., the year of the conquest of Babylon.
By dating the songs of Y?.io we extend also our limited knowledge
of the events in the east of the empire: before the Medes, who created

MITHRA
452
these songs, dared to attack Nineveh successfully, they had already
pushed their eastern boundaries as far as to the Indus (Gandara and
Thatagus) and to the Iaxartes.
Another old part of the Mithra yasht is a song which contains the
best known and best stanzas of the whole yasht, viz. 13-15. It is a song
to “Mithra in peace.” It describes the same horizon, reveals pre-Zoroas
trian notions still unimpaired, and must be attributed at any rate to
no younger date than the sixth century. Originally it seems to have
formed one hymn with the song to “Mithra as warrior.” One needs
only to repeat the invocation of st.145 with epithets different from
those of 25-102-112 after 36 and 69-98, the last stanzas of “Mithra as war
rior,” in order to obtain a perfect junction. The warlike and the peaceful
picture are antithetic, and we shall find enough confirmations for this
assumption of an original unit, to make it convincing.

Sequence of verses:
The metrical fault in 13a can either be in the rel. yo or in manyavo
yazato. One could think that yazato might be a mazdayasnian substitute
for a word of two syllables like bago, devo, offensive to later feeling;
but in the pre-Zoroastrian verses on ApamNapat as creator—see under
A.pamNapat’—he, too, is called yazato, and in the beginning of
“Mithra’s Questions” (see below), the god speaks of himself as yazata,
adorandus, he who is entitled to offerings, and there the context proves
beyond doubt that yazata is a pre-Zoroastrian predicate of gods and
must not be touched. Then, “yo” must be wrong, introduced when
the invocation “we worship Mithra who . .
.” was put before this stanza
instead of others which preceded it. The first of these is the one counted
today as 99: Mithra the dahyupatis—his old Median predicate—frava
zati, drives out, dasinam upa karanam, on the right border (south) of
the earth, where also the sun drives. The Veda speaks of the “two
nema,” the bright and the dark one.
This stanza was joined by 13: prvyo asnavati,23 he arrives before the
sun. It follows that also in 13c “yo” was substituted for an original “ho,”
for the same reason, fitting the song into the yasht. Now, st.99 is the
beginning of a new thread of thought, but not the beginning of a hymn;
other stanzas once preceded it, and, of the stanzas preserved, 145 fits
just as well here as before st.8, in “Mithra the warrior”: dahyupatim
yazamade, there, before yim yazante dahyupatayo, here before frava
zati dahyupatis. We may forthwith expect a number of epithets, which
bear upon the contents of the following verses, between the invocation
(145) and the beginning of the narrative part, for instance “rama.
sayana, who makes live in peace,” “hartar patar awiya^star, guardian,
protector, keeper,” “krsa.razah, he who makes straight furrows.” Like
22 afaat is Ar. *ap.uant > afvant, afant, cf. B. Geiger in Andreas-Testschr. 95. For ruva.apa and ruv>a.apa “with salt-water” and for “histante, to stand, stagnate” see under ‘Sea.’ In 142b there was probably a dvand\a, e.g. aspa or pasu with ga\e. 23 Text: asna\ati, s for s is a frequent misreading of Sasanian script.



MITHRA 455
wise, one can insert—after eliminating some disfiguring interpolations

st.44-45 between the invocation and st.99. The words fra#o.me#anam,
cf. zam.fratfo in 95—the whole earth as Mithra’s domicile—and his
appearing on mountains, cf. st.13, make the connection particularly
close. St.99 is a counterpart to 48a, in “Mithra the warrior” : at yat mi0ro
fravazati. In both cases the description of the situation follows first;
there, of the two armies facing each other, here of the broad round
earth. This responsion between the two songs continues.
Decisive for their antithetic composition is that the description of
the chariot in the first song, where the warrior-god holds the vazra in
his hand, has its exact counterpart in the second song, where the peace
able god comes “uzbazaus pati amr^tim, the hands high for-not-de
struction,” words that place st.124-125 solidly into this part of the song
between 99 and 12. This expresses the antithesis unmistakably. The eight
helpers in 45, nowhere else mentioned, are a counterpart to the figures
oh the chariot, which are less conspicuous in the second part.
The many verses of st. 13-15 have not been dissected when arranging
the song for the yasht. Omissions cannot be detected, but the contrary,
an undue elaboration—here silently omitted—e.g. of st.14. This verse,
from a cakatam to gavamca, is in reality the beginning of a new
stanza; the relative clauses of the preceding stanza end with the intrans.
“ 0waxsante, where . . . work.” The a before cakatam belongs to adiSati
at the end of i5f. The wrong numbering has caused wrong interpreta
tions.
The five—or, since the first two may be appellatives, three—place
names all belong to the east of Iran, where Mithra rises; they are mere
examples, names of parts of arya.sayanam, the middle krsvar. Instead
of the full enumeration of the six krsvar which follows, arzahi-savahi,
west and east, with hvanira#a as middle would be enough, and the
other names may have been added by the redactors to display their
erudition. The last sentence of 15 resumes, with hvanira#am adiSati,
the last line of 13 (which ought to be the first of 14) adiSati arya.
sayanam.
This was joined by st.95, a perfect counterpart to 13: St.13 describes
Mithra appearing before the sun, climbing the gold-tinted summits;
95 describes him after sunset, expanding over the whole earth (cf. st.44),
until he “embraces the two borders, mrzati uva karana.” In st.99 he was



MITHRA
456
driving on the “right border.” St.95 begins with a rel. yo which does not
connect the verbs awiyati and mrzati; with “yat” for “yo,” not only
these verbs would be connected “when he expands ... he embraces,”
but the existing antithesis to st.13 would be clearly expressed: “before
sunrise” he does this, “after sunset” that. One exchange between yat and
yo is attested in Yt.5,50 and 19,17; verses on Husravah’s racing, quoted
in Y/.5 in first person, with “yat,” in Yt. 19 in third person, with “yo.”
Such slight changes have been made everywhere in order to patch to
gether the fragments of songs to an Awestic yasht. The end of 95 first
repeats the last words of 99, then paraphrases those of 13 in a more
general sense, with the same “adiSati” which links also 13 to 15. There
with the song is complete in itself, though 99 is not of necessity its
beginning, nor 95 the end of the whole hymn.
This part of the hymn is a song to “Mithra in peace.” The god drives
over the whole known world and sees all happenings between heaven
and earth. In Herodotus vii,8 Xerxes says in the same spirit : ei rov rows

Margus and Gava, the “heart of Sughd”—see under ‘Videvdad’—are
situated in the original homeland, but here, united with Hareva, they
are, like this, not a mythical notion, but political names of three repre
sentative satrapies of the Median and later the Achaemenian empire.
It is the same representative style as Darius uses in Pers.g.
:
“This wide
earth on which are many countries, Parsa, Mada and the other lands
of other language, of the mountains and of the plains, on this side
of the sea and on that side, on this side of the desert and on that side.”
Hara brzatl, Mithra’s place at sunrise, is a mythical notion, but this
notion of the rim of the earth wandered with the people wherever they
went. Here, we clearly observe it transferred, as in Yaio,io where mount
uparisena as home of Homa replaces the Hara. Yr.19,3 mentions
‘“cakata uparisena, the summit too high for the sena,” the biggest and
therefore highest Hying bird. 24 Aristotle had heard of the uparisena
24 In Gr.Bdh. 121 the sena has the epithet “flriangura, with three toes.” The Assyrians speak in a similar way, e.g. Sargon, 8th Camp. I.98, of mount Uaus in Armenia: “issur same mupparsu



MITHRA 457
which he calls Parnasos, in Meteor.1^111,14-16: “so high that from its
summit one can see the eastern ocean.” Behind this range the Gandara
live, called, in the Akk. versions of the inscriptions paruparaesanna <
OP. *parauparisaina, Gr. Paropamisadai. The Paropamisos is the Hin
dukush. When one sees it the first time, from the Kabul side, one
believes one sees the unreal double reflection of an improbably high
mountain chain. The OIr. shape of Gr. Ariobarzanes for the mod.
Alburz < hara brzati, north of Teheran, shows that already before
Alexander’s time the concept of the mountain around the earth and its
name had been transferred to the Iranian ranges. When the Greeks
heard of it, they transformed it into their concept of the Caucasus
stretching in a straight line from the Black Sea to Farther India.
Kuh i Paruh is not a rare name; the best known is near Kirman
shahan. In this context, paruta or parvata and +cakata (uparisena) are
no longer mere appellatives, “mountain” and “summit,” but already
fixed as names of parts of the Hindukush.
Mythical placenames, imagined as outside of Iran, do not appear in
the entire Yt. 10. The description of the historical horizon in st.104 is
something entirely different from the placenames in the epic fragments
quoted in other yashts. And this horizon is the same in all songs which
are collected in Y/.io.
To st.13-15 Nyberg remarks: “Wir konnen . . . den Mithra yasht
genau lokalisieren. . . . Vor unsren Augen breitet sich hier das arische
Land von Herat und dem Paropamisos-Gebirge bis . . . Marw . . . aus,
Amu Darya-Becken, Aral-See, . . . verliert sich in der turkmenischen
Steppe bis zum Iaxartes [Aral and Iaxartes are thrown in]. Wir be
finden uns entschieden in Osten,” for the only reason that the sun
rises there. If the poet had added examples to the “two borders of the
earth” or the sunset in 95, we would find ourselves just as “decidedly”
in the north, south and west. But he was a poet, content to illustrate
the sunrise by the names of three eastern countries of the 127 countries
of the empire. One can hardly believe that without contradiction these
’p’lsyn or ’pvlsyn, irrespectively, cf. Gr.Bdh. 76 and 78, 80, 122. Only after the change to pirsen, the name became connected with Pars. Instead of the old etymology of sena: “Iktivos, falcon,” J. Charpentier, Monde Or. xxvi-vii, proposed OI. syena, Aw. sena. OSlav. sin' “dark blue” for “eagle, lammergeyer,” originally a color. sirus la iba’uma, not even the winged bird of heaven can fly over it.” Also in NP., Hamdallah, nuzhat gg and 301: “Kuh i kargas, near Natanz, quite isolated, 10 fars. in circumference, very high, so high that only vultures, kargas, can fly over it, hence its name.” The Pahl. spelling is



MITHRA

verses have always been and are still misconstrued as proving that the
Mithra yasht and the Awesta were created in the East. The Awesta as a
whole has no “home.” It is a compilation ; where its redaction took place
is indifferent; it was done in studies. The Mihr-yasht, too, has no “home”

it took at least 700 years before it assumed its present shape. Nor was
there an “eastern Mithra” different from others. What alone matters
is to recognize where and when the separate pieces originated that are
preserved in the Awesta.
In the present condition of Yt. 10, st.99, the “driving out” is followed,
in 100, by a stanza on the figures on the god’s chariot. This order, driv
ing out and description of the chariot, is apparently original, even if
shape and order of the verses were no longer intact. Describing the
chariot is essential for hymns to Mithra, and every song offered an occa
sion. Thus I have inserted one description into “Mithra as warrior”
and one into “Mithra in peace.” We have in Y/.io remainders of at
least three such descriptions which cannot be combined but must come
from different songs. The one stretches over st.66-70, the other is in
98-100, the third in 124-132. Besides, there are small fragments in 136
and 142-143. The fact that the second is found at present between
st. 96 and 99, both belonging to “Mithra in peace,” does not prove that
the description belonged to that song. A criterion for separating the
various descriptions and attributing them to a special song is the follow
ing: the songs discussed so far, and more so some still to be discussed,
show Mithra in two roles: being ako vahistasca, the bad and the best,
he can come as ramasayana, he who brings peace, or as acetar, avenger.
Now one reads in st.124-125:
uzbazaus pad amrxtlm (fravazate) with arms raised for-not-destroying
(mi(?ro yo vurugavyutis) Mithra drives out in his chariot.
etc. as in the text above.
amrxtl—also in the sosyant verses of Yf. 19,89—“not-destruction, not
killing,” with the “a” that inverts the notion, means “the opposite of
destruction.” pad amrxtlm explains the gesture uzbazaus, arms raised.
To raise the open palms is a gesture of salute all over the world and
means one has no weapons and no bad intentions. But in 96 he carries
the vazra in his hand, the attribute of the avenger. Therefore, the de



MITHRA 459
scription of the vazra in 96, though being placed close to st.95 and 99,
does not belong to them, but to st.101, part of “Mithra the warrior,”
whereas 124-125, like 95 and 99, belong to “Mithra in peace.” And the
second description of the chariot, in 68, is part of the war-song. No
need to say that the line interpolated after b, “for whom the mazdayas
nian religion prepares the paths for good-going” must be deleted.
The translation of hangrwnati “whose chariot (Rtis) drives, lenkt”
is wrong,25 and Bartholomae’s explanation of fravazate vavazanam,
“herangefahren kommt beim fahren, sva. den Wagen lenkend” 26 is
impossible, because the god comes “uzbazaus, with arms raised.” Lom
mel’s translation of raffestar by “Wagenlenker” is equally wrong: the
gods and ra#estar do not drive themselves, but had their heniochos:
Mithra’s driver is Damois Upamano; the name of Vistaspa’s driver was
Visatarus, client of the notarya; Xerxes’ driver was Patipamphes, son of
Otanes-Hutana, Herodotus 7,40.
Yr.10,125 contains an important gloss, difficult to understand, on the
harnessing of the horses: “te vispa frayuxta ham ivamca simamca simoi
fframca drta hukrta uparispata aka bastam xsa#ram varyam.”
sima simoi#ra seems to be an original dvandva like yuyo.sami (with
variants) in Vid.1^,10, i.e. yugau.sami, Ved. yuga.samyam “yoke and
plug?” It is to be compared with Arm. samik‘ sametik'.27 The wide
distribution of the words shows that something extremely old is in
question. The Sanskrit and Armenian words seem to refer originally to
oxen, Yt.10,125 to horses. By chance, two chariots of Mitanni-Aryan
origin are preserved, the one in the Museo Archeologico in Florence, the
other in Cairo, moreover a few Egyptian wall-paintings and sculptures,
all of the 15th century b.c. (cf. ami ix, p.ips).
23 Wfi. 528: “ham + V grab-, in seiner Gewalt haben, halten, sva. lenken, Yr.io,68 and 145.” In st. 1 3 Mithra grvvnati, i.e. takes, climbs the High Hara, hence ham-grvvnati “he mounts together with, mitbesteigen.” One “takes” a mountain like a mountain-climber, and “takes” a carriage. 26 The fact that the med. fravazate, apparently forming fig. etymol. with vavazanam, overlaps the verse, causes no embarrassment as soon as one has recognized that st.124 belongs behind 99: it merely resumes “fravazati” of 99, as necessary after the stanzas had been separated. For the same reason, at the line with mi£ro, the subject had to be repeated. This separating and dismembering of the verses produced also the overlapping agrwnavate in st.104. All these words do not belong to the original text. The rest joins st.99 perfectly. 27 Hiibschmann, Arm.Gramm.48: “sami-k‘ (io-Stamm) zwei Holzer, die durch die beiden Locher des Joches gesteckt und unten durch einen Strick, sametik‘, zusammengehalten werden. Skr. samya ‘pin of a yoke,’ NP. slm, in ligna in utraque parte iugi bo\is allegata; sametik 4
, aus sami Jochholz und ti, ‘Band bindend* von Vde-, Skr. da, di, Gr. 5e ‘binden,’ einem Skr. *sam>a.di entsprcchend.”

The horses pull by means of two thongs, (1) the neck-thong2S laid
horizontally around the neck (throat) at the height of the withers, and
(2) the chest-thong which runs vertically from the withers downwards,
behind the elbow. These thongs are fastened, at the withers, to the ends
of the yoke which rests on the withers, perhaps they are knotted to the
wither-forks that are suspended by short straps from the ends of the
yoke. The bent yoke runs across the end of the chariot-pole to which
it is fastened by a peg and straps. The pole connects the yoke directly
with the axle under the body of the chariot. The bridles consist of a
snaffle with its lines; they are loose, nowhere fastened, but probably
passed through a pair of bridle-rings 00 shaped, which were fixed to the
ends of the yoke.
Since sima simohhra must designate the yoke and what belongs to it,
iva is probably the word for the pole, with drta hukrta as descriptive
adjectives, uparispata may mean “with ends upbent” or, as subst.dual,
the “wither-forks.” One compares aka with “anku(-pisimna), (adorning
themselves with) clasps?”, Skr. anka, Gr. ojko s and dyKvXr} “loop,
strap” (perhaps also Aw. akavo, which is certainly not “scissors”). The
sense “peg, Zapfen” is doubtful; “leather straps” is not impossible.
Shortly before the description of the chariot in st.68, a good fragment
is preserved in bad surroundings:
66: yim hacate29 rtis vahvi (Mithra) to whom belong (dual)
parandica ravarafla the good Rtis and Parandl
with the fast chariot.
To the same original context evidently belonged a fragment attached
to 17.8,38, quotation of the R^sa myth, discussed above:
a dim paskat anu.mrzatam They (both) embraced him from
the back,
rtisca vahvi brzati the good Rtis, the high one,
parandica ravaratfa and Parandi with the fast chariot.
The language is good, the epithet of Parandi archaic. Both fragments
are genuine, both are in wrong surroundings. The goddesses, of course,
embrace or kiss their husband Mithra, not Rxsa’s arrow, to which the
pronoun refers in its present position.
28 Not to be confounded with a second, merely ornamental strap below it. 29 Text: hacate, for the dual hacate, as e.g. vrnatate in Y.31,17,



MITHRA 461
Also in st.142-143 a similar verse appears. Wolff-Bartholomae’s and
Lommel’s attempts at translating these verses as they stand in strange
surroundings, are love’s labor’s lost, and it is not worth wdiile to make
known the apparatus that leads to their reduction. They have gaps
and interpolations, are written in an orthography omitting termina
tions, and are, as a whole, what Meillet called “refondu,” that means
the form is bad, but the thought genuine. As residue we obtain, 142-143
:
purvis veSls the many forms (Mithra)

[sraya] ya#a daman srestais [in beauty] like (that) of the most

The threefold comparison with moon, Sirius and sun is interrupted,
between the words starahya and ya#a, by the interpolation
yahya vartam hangrwnati whose chariot likewise mounts
,aSavis paoiris spitama1
a. p. , o Spitama
!
The vocative spitama equals an exclamation Jesus! in a hymn addressed
to Apollo. The sentence is but a damaged splinter, which one must not
try to interpret from the present context. A comparison with the begin
ning of st.68 (see above) almost literally identical, and with the Rtis
Parandi fragments furnishes at once a graphic explanation: there we
have asis, with s for rt, here aSavis; there parandica, here ,paoiris 1
. In
a script like that of the Awraman parchment, first century b.c., rt looks
like dvy, and vyr like rnd, hence aSavis =rtis, paoiris = parandica.30 The
30 The Aw. character for which we note s is a ligature of Sasan. vxr for old rt. It was invented in the middle of the fourth century a.d. and can go back to an older ligature of the time of Ardashlr I, but once the writing was rt. If such an rt occasionally was not replaced by the later style, misinterpretations were bound to arise. In the Ars. script of the Awraman parchment r is still = d [only uncial Pahlavik of the Sasan. period introduced a diacritical hook under the letter] and t = vy. 'bits there equals 'rts. paoiris does not stand for normal prvys but is prndvs, i.e. parandica, misread as psyrys.



MITHRA
462
goddesses on Mithra’s chariot are the same as elsewhere, Rtis and
Parandl. The verb which ends in -ati (with long a) was a dual in -ate:
yahya vartam hangrwnate rtis parandica [vahvi].
These fragments are older than Y .Haft. 38,3—see under ‘Deva’
where, in a long series of abstract nouns, Parandl appears with the
standing epithet of Rtis, vahvi, no more with ravara#a, the epithet she
bore as Mithra’s wife. Therewith she disappears entirely. The name
means something like “luxuria” and stands beside striyo maya in the
Afrin.3,4, in a theological-religious context where it is comprehensible
only as a misinterpretation of an old fragmentary sentence.
These verses recall a strange “wagon-scene” in the Rtis Yt. 17,17-22.
Rtis stops her chariot at the call of Zoroaster, who introduces himself:
“First man to pray the Rtam vahistam!” and the goddess answers, 21:
nazdyo mam upa.hista upa me srayahva vartahe31
“step up closer to me, squat down on my chariot.”
The loose trousers, which Zoroaster wears as a Mede, then, ride up32
a dim usca pari.mrzat thereupon she embraced him from above
havya bazu dasinaca with the left forearm and the right one,
dasina bazu havyaca with the right forearm and the left one
“and spoke the words: You have such handsome calves, huvascuva,
and such long arms, drga.bazaus, to your body hvarnah is given, as
true as I tell you!”
According to Hertel “iibertragt die Gottin natiirlich durch das ‘Um
streicheln’ das Himmelslicht auf Zarathustra.” Lommel: “Die Beteue
rung (as true as . . .) lasst das Lob der Schonheit als Segensspruch
erkennen . . . das Streicheln, pari.mrzat, ist die Geste des Segnens.”
Such sentimental interpretations are to no purpose. One does not “stroke
around” with the forearms, and V mrz- means “to rub, wipe, embrace,
31 Bartholomac and Lommel: “Iehne dich an meinen Wagen,” which has only two wheels and would tip over. Rtis stops to give Zoroaster “a lift”; upa is “upon,” Vsri-, Gr. xkiva is the crossing of the legs: in Vid. 3,29 the beggar squats before the door, sravano.
32 Cf. Tabari 111,1469: “al-Ma'mun said to abu Hashisha—a prophecy of which onlv the last part comes true: The caliph after nnsclf will ha\e a ‘ayun in his name, the one after him a ha, and the one after that will have yellow calves! And thus was al-Mutawakkil, I have seen it mvself, when he sat down on the throne, and his calves were uncovered: they were as >ellow as if painted with safran.”



MITHRA 4^
kiss.”33 It is not even a “praise of beauty.” huvascuva is “having good
hollows of the knee” namely for running, a mere variant of Mithra’s
epithet “rSva.zanga, with straightened knees,” and drya.bazaus, Skr.
dirghabahuh is “a mark of royalty,” cf. Hertel, iiqf,vii,50. Artaxerxes
makrocheir, longimanus (NP. transl. dirazdast) has this epithet, the
meaning of which a sarcastic remark of al-Bundarl, historian of the
Seljuks, reveals, wrho says of the vezier abu 1-mahasin ‘Abdaldjalll b.
‘All al-Dahistam :
34 “in injustice he had an outstretched hand and a long
arm.” It is the long arm of justice, law—opposite to the “short wings,
Germ, kurze Beine” of lies—another epithet of Mithra. As epithets of
Zoroaster the words are as unfit as wT ould be TrdSas a/cvs and evpvs
a>fxoL(TL for Plato. Obviously there were old verses describing Rtis em
bracing Mithra, w'hich served as model for this miscarried product of a
late poetaster.
The descriptions of the chariot all follow a pattern: “Mithra comes
in the chariot—with him on the chariot is the goddess . . .—the chariot
is drawn by horses.” And since in the neighborhood of this splinter
(130) there is another one (136) with yahmai 0an]ayante, which cannot
be connected with any other description, one must combine the two:
136: yahmai arusa arvanto For wrhom white racers
yuxtam vartam #an]ayante pull the harnessed chariot,
evo ca^ro zaraneno the one wheel is of gold,
asanasca vispa.bama and the jewels are “containing-all
light.” 35
These verses add an entirely new feature to the description of the
chariot itself, which is otherwise characterized only by the two adj. in
124, “hama.taxma and vispa.pis, smoothly running and of all colors,”
like a rainbow.36 The one wheel does not indicate a one-wheeled chariot,

and one cannot adduce as an analogy the Vedic moon-chariot with
seven wheels—certainly not “vielleicht in irdischen Verhaltnissen be
griindet” (Hertel, Siegesf. 157), on earth it is enough to be the fifth
wheel. The one wheel is a symbol; it is what Daniel 7,13 in the descrip
tion of God’s throne, and Eze\. 1,15 in the description of the Cherubim,
call “galgal,” the great nimbus behind the throne and in the back of
the Cherubs, pictured “like a beryl” and “with eye-stones.”37 asa means,
in OP. and in Aw., as designation of material, “ore, metal,” NP. sa, and
“jewel”; placed beside gold, “vispa.bama, (containing) all-light” de
fines the material asa. It is the diamond, unless it be the ruby even
higher valued. The great nimbus before which the god is standing on
his chariot—see under ‘Sculpture’—is made of gold and diamonds.
In st.68, the charioteer Damois Upamano appears in a strange harem
of abstract notions, all “belonging” to Mithra like Rtis and Parandi.
And in 125, where the Zoroastrian Oista has replaced another figure,
an “Upamano of the mazdayasnian religion, denaya mazdayasnois
upamano,” nowhere else mentioned, stands on Mithra’s chariot, while
in the next stanza the genuine Damois upamano, who according to st.
52 ought to come arunning when Mithra orders a start, “comes driving
in the shape of a wild boar etc.” The magnificent description of the
boar is a plagiate from Y/.i4,i5. In st.70 Vrthragna himself drives,
equally wrong, in front of Mithra, in the shape of a boar (borrowed
from 14,15). As a god of light, Mithra can arrive on the Hara preceding
the immortal sun, but Vrthragna is no luminary deity and is not
Mithra’s, his equal’s, forerunner.
For the understanding of the striking name Damois upamano one
must ignore these passages, upamana means “anathema”; for dami the
best way is the one indicated by Bartholomae who connects damis and
Oij.u<s, a view strongly supported by the epithet damidata of Rtis, Dike,
wife of Mithra. In a similar way, Sroso is linked to Rtis by his epithet
rtiyo. In many cases, the mazdayasnian redaction of the Awesta seems
to have replaced an original damidata by mazdadata.
Beside the goddess and the charioteer, two helpers are on Mithra’s
chariot, comparable to his eight ratayo, retainers and outlook men in
st.44, namely (100)
:
37 Likewise; year date 13 of Ammiditana, see Ungnad Datenlisten in Reall.Assjr. n.iSyff., first dyn. of Babylon: “asme gal.gal.la na du.sa.a-ke su.nir.ra l.mah.e.sa c.babbar.ra.se in.ne.en.tu.ra, great sundisks of agate, magnificent as an emblem, he brought into Ebabbara.”



MITHRA 465
dasinam he upa arSam On his right side drives
vazate yo vahus sroso rtiyo the good Sroso rtiyo
varyastaram he upa arSam vazate on his left drives
rasnus brzo yo amava the high Rasnus the powerful.
This is a genuine old verse in a prosaic form—but easy to make met
rical—which one could imagine after st.68 in “Mithra the Warrior,” or
after the fragment st.143. The lines exemplify that unmetrical passages
may be good, and metrically unobjectionable ones false.
Zoroaster has deprived Mithra of these helpers and of his wife Rtis
and has given them to his AhuraMazdah. Personified, the word srosa
does not signify “obedience”—see Y.43,12 under ‘Hospitium’—but
“hearing,” as Hertel emphasizes in Siegesf. 67. Sroso holds with Mithra
the office which is called “gosaka” as OP. title of an officer of the
king, whose activity is that of a policeman. Cf. Aristotle, de mundo,
fol.398 a
: TruXcopoi re Kal amxKoucrrai A.eyopevoi &>s av 6 fiacrikevs avr05
8eo-770T7js /cat deos ovopa^opevos 7ravra pev /3Xerrot irdvra S’dxovoi.
Srosa is Mithra’s “ear.”
Rasnu is usually explained as “just,” personification of justice; but
Hertel says “Altp. Schreibung fur ra^snu, zu Ved. V’raks- ‘schiit
zend.’ ” His epithet rtiya is the masc. of the name Rtis, meaning Dike.
Rasnus is in the “Ordeal-yasht,” the overseer of the ordeals, because
he is a helper of Mithra, the god of social law. Whether he “protects”
the innocent or reveals guilt and innocence in “justice” through the
ordeal, his role in both cases is a forensic one, and together Sroso and
Rasnus embody a criminal and protective police, Arab, surta and haras.
As Mithra’s helper they reveal another side of the god, not touched in
the songs we have so far studied.
The horses are always described, in the manner of the Awesta, by
epithets. They are a team of four white horses, called spetita or arusa,
and Mithra is therefore called “arusaspa, with the white horses” in Yt.
10,102. hama.gona sounds as if the color of the four horses was exactly
alike; but in Y/.8,58 “a white and a black or an animal hamagona in any
other color” means one-colored as opposed to piebald, Aw. sai-. manyava
is “celestial,” manyuvasah “dwelling in heaven,” manyushvar^a “feed
ing on celestial food,” reason for their “immortality.” A compound



MITHRA

like manyushvar^a, with -sh- < -s-,38 living continuation of Ar. *maniu.
svartha, proves that hnaniava was a full synonym of deva, heavenly,
already in Aryan, like NP. minawi. asaya “without shadow” is another
genuinely old epithet, cf. Theopomp /aTjre ovaas iroiovvTas (under
‘Chronology’) as characteristic of life in the transfigured world.
The Persians’ custom of carrying holy white horses with them in
war has its origin in the Mithra cult. According to the story told by
Herodotus 1,189 (from Hecataeus, end of 6th century) such a holy
horse was drowned in the Gyndes (Diyala) when Cyrus crossed the
river for the attack on Babylon. The legend that the river was punished
by being divided in 360 canals is associated even today with the ruins
of the dam of BaDjabbara, at the point where the Diyala breaks through
the Hamrin and the Khalis canals branch off.39
The chariot characterizes Mithra, in Aryan conception, as a light of
heaven, but he was not the sun-god nor the heaven, for in st.145, he
is invoked with the heaven, Varuna, in the dvandva mi/9ra-ahura, and
beside sun, moon and stars. In the “Peace-song” he travels on the light
side of the earth, appears “in front of the sun” and expands after sunset
over the whole earth, seeing on his way all that happens between
heaven and earth. In st.142 he produces at early dawn the many shapes
which were invisible at night, and is likened to the sun, the moon and
Sirius.
On the other hand, the disappearance of the sun-god from the Iranian
pantheon can be explained only by assuming that Mithra absorbed the
old Suryas. Yt.6, dedicated to Hvar^seta, is a clumsy piece of work,
without any old substance, and only shows that the late period in
which it was produced had no longer anything to say about Hvar^seta.
He has dissolved himself into Mithra and partly into Yama ^seta.
38 The equally old st.m8 has purushvaflra, while at younger places the writing is puruhvaflra. Very late passages speak of manyava deva, in reality a synomm, “heavenly gods,” mostly coupled with varunya deva, which originally was Oeoi ovpavtoi, see under ‘Deva’ and ‘Videvdad.’ 39 Gr.Bdh. 86, ch. “Rivers,” mentions a vnds or vndys r55, written in the next line, in Paz., vinai5is(nom.). In Vid.6, 40 the acc.adv. anaiSIm appears beside niyapam patiyapam, downstream, upstream; Bartholomae, ZAirWb. 109: “viell. haplol. aus ana.naSIm, iiber den Fluss hin, OI. nadi ‘Fluss’ das im Aw. fehlt.” The name of the river \inadi(s) corresponds to this
#ana.nadl-; with vi- “asunder,” it fits the legend; Hecataeus’ Gyndes might be vinadis, and the mention of the name in the Gr.Bdh. a remnant of the same legend. Cf. the district Tov5ct<rov the irrigation of which was restored by the stratiarch of Su<a, Zamaspes, in 213 Sel- = 98 b.c., according to the Gr. inscription, F. Cumont, crai. 1931, 238-252.



MITHRA 467
Nyberg—and recently Henning—distinguishes between “Mithra in
the West” (383) : “Hier ist namlich Mithra ohne Zweifel der Vertreter
der Sonne: mihr u mah, Sonne und Mond” [this is NP., not a question
of geography, but of time] —and “Mithra in the east,” the “Lokal” of
the Mithra yasht, where (53) he cannot be the sun because he appears
before sunrise. But 57: “Es ist ein sonnenbeschienenes Gemalde, das
uns im Mithra-yasht, (13-15) entgegentritt” and 59: “Es kann kein
Zweifel daran sein, dass Mithra . . . wesentlich der Gott des sternen
geschmiickten AfacAdiimmels ist.” The “Nightheaven” comes as a
shock, and the various propositions, beyond doubt, contradict the texts
as completely as themselves.
The relation between Mithra and Hvarxseta resembles that between
Apollo and Helios, and in the votive inscriptions of Persepolis, shortly
after Alexander, Apollo and Helios both take the place of Mithra.
That is the period in which Hvarxseta disappeared. As late as in the
Mat£atr. one finds the notion of “five lights”: ataxs, fire, and beside
the real luminaries set = sun, mah = moon, starak = stars, an unreal
“varcak e ac asman ayet, brilliancy that proceeds from the heaven”; cf.
Daniel 12: “The knowing ones will shine like the brilliancy of the vault
of heaven,” and Mir.Man. 19,19: “Brighter than the light of the sun, the
vrdyvn, the sphere of heaven shines.” This light, supposed to be the
heaven’s own, is Mithra.
The functions of the Old Iranian gods are less delimited from each
other than, for instance, those of the Greek gods. The spheres of their
activities overlap. That is also the case with Mithra, but one side he
has all to himself, namely the social-judiciary one, and that is extremely
old. Meillet, J.As. 1907, i52f., went so far as to consider this sociological
significance as the original one: Mithra as the god of friendship and
of loyalty to contracts. I always feel doubtful about assuming such
abstractions under conditions of remote antiquity. One support of this
theory is the interpretation of the name: Ved. mitram, n., “friendship,”
mitrah, m., “friend” or n.pr. Mitra; and according to Bartholomae
Gath, and Aw. mi#ra m. “Vertrag, religiose Bin dung.” The problem is
hidden in the notion translated by “Vertrag, contract” and it is not
necessary to separate the “god of light” and the “god of contract.”
In Vid.4,2, a juridical text of a similar kind as the “wergild tariff” of
Y£.10,116, treated here at the end of the chapter, mif?ra has the significa



MITHRA
468
tion “(solemn) promise, vow.” There are six kinds of promises: (1)
vacahina, made by word of mouth; (2) zasta.mrsta, made by shaking
hands; (3) pasu.maza, by pledging a sheep; (4) stora.maza, by pledging
an ox; (5) vira.maza, a slave; (6) dahyu.maza, a plot of land, or vil
lage. Answerable as joint security, “hada.ci#a, Mitbiissende” are the
next-of-kin, naba.nazdista in taxes mounting according to the six steps.
Membership of the vis involves the duty of standing bail. Something
very archaic is preserved in this tariff: Lat. vindex reveals similar no
tions in Rome, and OHG. hantfesti > handfeste = promise, corresponds
exactly to Ir. zasta.mrsta.40 Every promise is made under oath, and every
break means perjury.
Promise is the meaning of mi#ra also at another late place, Y/.io,2:
mi#ram ma janya spitama Do not break a mi#ra, Spitama,
ma yim druvatat prsahe not one made with a drugvant,
ma yim hvadenat rtavnat not one made with an orthodox
coreligionist,
uwaya zi asti mi0ro for a mi#ra is mutual!
The inept form, an instruction for Zoroaster about a legal theory
which he rejected, is a matter of redaction, part of “Mithra’s rehabilita
tion.” An opposition of drugvant and hvadena rtavan is recent and
quite foreign to the Mithraic sphere. The only old element is the last
line: every mi#ra is mutual, uwaya = Lat. ambo.
There are other places, where the signification “promise, contract”
is not at all suited for mi#ra and mi^radru^s, e.g. in Yt. 10:
17: yo noit kahmai awi.droxSo Who is not-to-be-sinned-against by
anybody,
(noit nmanahe nmanopatas, noit viso vispatas, noit)
(zantous zantupatas noit daiqhaus daiqhupatas)
18: yazi <va) dim awi.druzati when he still sins against him,
(nmanahe va nmanopaitis viso va vispaitis)
(zantaus va zantupaitis dairjhaus va daiqhupaitis)
frasa upa.scindayati smashes beyond [repair]
mi#ro granto upa.tbisto Mithra, furious, offended,
uta nmanam uta visam the house and the clan,
uta zantum uta dahyum and the district and the province
40 C£. Arab, safaqa and yad Allah ‘ala yadaikum.



MITHRA 469
(uta nmananam nmanopaitis uta visam vispaitis)
(uta zantunam zantupaitis uta dairjhunam daiqhupaitis)
uta dahyunam fratamaSata and the first-born of the provinces.
A rare form like the part.fut.pass. awi.droxSo in 17a—cf. Gath,
dafsnya in Y.53,8 “they shall be to-be-deceived-ones,” diwzadyai in Y.
44,4 “must (not) be deceived”—is old, and 18a is closely connected with
it because the subject of awi.druzati must be abstracted from kahmai
in 17a. On the contrary, the repeated enumeration of the four social
steps—which recalls the catechism in Y/.i9,i8—is not old, but intro
duced by the efhiyas, proud of their catechetic erudition, in order to
define “kahmai” as chiefs of the nmana etc. fratamaSata of 18. This
definition is entirely wrong, the result is: when a nmanapatis offends,
Mithra destroys the nmana, when a vispatis, the vis etc., whereas the
real meaning is: if “anyone” offends, the god destroys “everything,”
him and his family, clan etc., as the fragment Y/.io,a says:
mrncate vispam dahyaum maryo miflradruxs
The mifiradruxs ruins the whole country.
The verses i8d-f are the only genuinely old occurrence of the four
step formula in the whole yasht, and these evidently already belonged
to the past when the wrong interpolations were added.
granto upatbisto in 18c have causative meaning: “because he is en
raged by the offense,” just as in st.47 “frasruto zaranimno, because he
is enraged (against the enemies) by the songs (of his adherents).”
Former translations, taking the text as a homogeneous one, sound as
if all Iranian “Obrigkeiten, fratamatat,” from time to time, became
“mi#radruxs, die Freundschaft betriigend, or beliigend” (in the Vedic
meaning) or “dem Vertrag Gewalt anthuend” (in the Iranian meaning
of mifha). They do that to the present day every day, and history
teaches that countries do not go to pieces in this way. In st.104, the
mifhadruxs must flee from the revenge of the god to the extreme ends
of the world. If those be merchants owing a debt, peasants not punc
tually fulfilling a delivery, all of humanity—with the words of Videv
dad I—would stay in the krsvar, at the horizon of the world. Offenses
against civil law are entirely out of the question, and mi#ra cannot
mean “contract” in any modern sense, but only criminal offenses against
penal law. Since the god punishes the criminal himself with his family,



MITHRA
470
clan, tribe, country and their first-born, one cannot avoid thinking of
blood-revenge dominating criminal law.
There was once an antithesis to st.17-18, a fragment of which is
worked into a salute to the birth of Zoroaster, interpolated in the
memorial document Y/.i3,95:
mi/9ro yo vurugavyutis Mithra with the wide pastures
fraSat vispam increases all
fratamaTata dahyunam the first-born of the countries
yozantisca ramayati and pacifies those in turmoil.
The verses are not complete: in analogy to 10,18 one would expect
nmana and vis behind fraSat vispa. fratamaSata appears only in these
two places, which originally belonged to one and the same song, though
they are now scattered over Yt. 10 and 13. Y/.io is in better condition
and renders T of the archetype by S, not by t: fratamaSata is Old Per
sian for Aw. fratamazata, see under ‘Social Structure.’ The authenticity
of 95d is confirmed by Dctr. NiR.A,54: “ya0a avena imam bumlm
yoSantim, when He saw this earth in turmoil.” Darius, significantly,
transfers, as Zoroastrian, Mithra’s role to AhuraMazdah.
Yt. 10,83-84:
83: (yim dahyos dahyupatis) baSa (ustana.zasto) zbayati avahe
(and anal, zantos zantupatis, 84: viso vispatis, nmanahya
nmanopatis) “to whom verily cry for help”
84: (yim) dvacina pi#ya hacimna, any two that have a feud,
(baSa (ustana.zasta) zbayati
avahe)
yim driyuscit rta.tkeso to whom a beggar, one following
Rta’s commandments,
apayato havais datais from whom his rights are with
held,
baSa (ustana.zasto) zbayati verily cries for help!
avahe
As in st.17-18, the e#riyas have put in their catechetic wisdom, with
out grammar, meter and sense, and have tried to give the common cry
for help a Zoroastrian coloring by interpolating “ustana.zasta, with



MITHRA 471
hands outstretched,” the Zoroastrian attitude of prayer (Y.29,5 and
50,8), spoiling therewith the meter.
Our surmise, when comparing the “War song” and the “Peace song,”
finds strong support here: there was a hymn moving entirely in an
titheses, and the st.17-18, the antithetic fragment in ¥£.13,95, and prob
ably 10, 83-84, were parts of it. But 17-18 is not the beginning of a
hymn; the rel. yo requires an invocation preceding it. Such an invoca
tion, in antitheses, moreover with the emphasis on dahyu, the peace
and strife of the provinces, exists in st.38, verses which therefore must
have preceded st.17-18.
38: tuvam ako vahistasca Thou, the bad and the best,
mi#ra ahi dahyubyo Mithra, art thou for the countries,
(tuvam ako vahistasca
mi#ra ahi martiyakebyo)
tuvam a^stois an.axstoisca Thou, over peace and strife
mitfra xsayahi dahyunam Mithra, of the countries thou art
master
A similar thought is expressed in poor language, in st.26:
akataram srosyanam the worst for those to be chastised,
acetaram mi0radru]am the avenger for the criminals,
yo dahyaum an.adruxto who gives to the country where he is not
offended
uparai amai daSati superior power of attack,
yo dahyaum an.adruxto who gives to the country where he is not
offended
uparai vrtfrai daSati superior power of defense.
St.38 may have concluded the opening invocation miflram . . . yaza
made. One can let pass 38b as metrical or easily make it metrical; d,
where one syllable should be eliminated, contributes nothing to the
thought, separates dahyubyo from dahyunam which ought to be as close
as possible, and impairs the thought these words express: in this song
the god does not face single “mortals, martiyaka,” but their collective,
dahyu, countries, peoples. The idea of the universality of the god and
the individualism of men is not yet ripe.
A stanza like Y£.io,79 must be judged differently:



472 MJTHRA
tuvam (ta) dahyavo nipahi
ya hubrtim yatayati
mi#rahya vurugavyutois
tuvam ta frascindayahi
ya ran^syatis dahyavo
You protect the provinces (case!)
those (where) well-treatment of ( !)
Mithra with the wide pastures is his part.
You destroy those,
which (are) hostile countries.
This is no longer Old Iranian. The two rel. ya are MP. idafats. yata
yati is denom. of yata “lot, part,” (not Wb.\ “in Gang setzen, sich be
fleissigen”). hubrti is an artificial n.abstr., modeled after verses like Yt.
10,102
:
ya#a hubrto barate, or its opposite in 48: yada. duzbrto barate.
The increase of abstract formations goes together with the loss of inflec
tion, and the same idafats are found in the inscriptions of Artaxerxes II,
in which the inflection is entirely artificial. The rel. ya is not resumed
(in b) by an enclit. pronoun in the obi. case: “which ... in them”
meaning “in which, where.” This feature is preserved in the Sasanian
protocol formula “ke ci#re ac yazdan,” not ke.s ci 0re. The language is
a very early Middle Iranian, ranxsyatis dahyavo (instead of acc.
dahyus) is taken from st.27: dahyaus ransyantfya, which thereby be
comes the only place where this word is authentic.41 St.79, thus, is
merely a late and bad paraphrase of frequently expressed thoughts.
A large continuous piece of this hymn is preserved in st.108-111. We
may call it “Mithra’s Questions,” because there is a relation between
its literary form and that of Zoroaster’s Questions, which raise the type
to a higher, philosophical level, in the same way that the “Cow Gatha”
does with the “Theft of the Herd.”

The beginning of 108, ko mam yazate, and the questions with kah
mai that follow, fit so well, as to contents and form, on 17-18, yo noit
kahmai, that we may regard st.17-18 as the introduction to the “Ques

474
tions.” Conclusive for this assumption is that the verses 108 and no
modify the idea of the “first-born, fratamaSata” by asna frazanti : frata
maSata appears nowhere else, and asna frazanti at no other place of
Yt.io. asna, with Bailey, equals “azata, agnatus, one’s own progeny.”
In Yt.5,8 and 124 the quotations from the epics start with
ko mam stavat ko yazate Who will praise me (Anahita), who bring
offerings,
kahmai upa.hacayani whose prayer shall I grant,
frarahai haumanahaica that he be pleased and of good cheer ?
The rest are later accretions. Nothing remains there of an antithetic
verse, but it must have existed because the goddess always grants or
refuses alternately. Similar questions are found in the Tistriya Yt. and
in the Fravartin Yt. Antithetic questions therefore were a pattern of the
old poetry. But Mithra’s questions differ from these by their contents.
The repeated words “kahmai balsam,apabarani ^sayamno” describe
the god as the “baga” par excellence, the one who “allots, Vbag-,”
fate, “ba^ta,” good and bad, to mankind, as the Sorijp idco
v
*2
OP. uses Vma-, mi-: “framana, lot, fate, pofpa.” Dar. NiR.Afij: hya
oramazdaha framana ho.te gasta ma #andaya! “what Oramazda allots
shall not appear hellish to you!” The change reveals, again, that Zoro
aster had transferred this role from Mithra to AhuraMazdah.
The use of “azam” in these verses is the same as that defined by Meil
let as characteristic of the Darius inscriptions. In 108 Mithra calls him
self “yazata, adorandus,” as one who must be worshipped with yasht
and yasna. The sentence proves the pre-Zoroastrian age of the term
yazata—as does the hymn to ApamNapat. For rayi, Gath, rai, in io8d
see under ‘Fravarti.’
The cultural picture revealed in 109 and hi determines the date of
the song: puruspaSa, lit. “with many armies,” and hvani-sa^ta. hvani-,
to Vhu-, whence hvandra, huti, hunara, see under ‘Architecture,’ is “to
manufacture with skill”; sa^ta, to NP. saltan, saz-, is the word for
42 What Mithra allots is baga.baxta. The theological distinction of the Men.Xr. 24, quoted in AltpJnschr. 145, “baxt, fate assigned at die beginning; bagobaxt, what the gods allot apart
from the predetermined fate”—as corollary to the doctrine of predetermination—is younger
than this Sasanian doctrine itself, and bagobaxt does no more contain the notion “additional” than baxt that of “at the beginning.” Translating baga.baxta, a pre-Zoroastrian word, by “allotted by the gods” involves that AhuraMazdah was, at that antiquity, included in “bagaho.” The greater probability is that baga has the same definite meaning “Mithra” as in baga.data = miflradata, baga.buxsa = Mihr.bojet etc.



MITHRA 475
industrial fabrication, especially of metals and weapons. Here the adj.
indicates engines of war, artillery, which the Iranians had already
when they besieged and took one Assyrian fortress after the other
(Samas omina), before conquering Nineveh. The adjectives presup
pose the organization of large armies, as they were fully developed in
the Achaemenian epoch.
With sa#rascit43 a series of military titles in poetical disguise begins:
sastar is Arab, amir, MP. spahpat, general. With the adj. hama.xsaflra
(whence MP. “hamsahr, world”) it means the command over the
armies of the whole empire, origin of the titles formed with “sahr-, of
the empire” in Sasanian times. Hertel, Siegesf. 132, refers to 6 [iiya?
jSacriXev?, but the title is a purely military one. Ved. ubha samsa (= OP.
Xsayaftya and framatar) with which Hertel deals in that connection,
comes near to Arab, al-ri’asatain, political and military command, but
even that is not a sovereign title. kamrSa.gan as honorific44 signifies
“having power over life and death,” like Arab, “malik ruqab al-umam,
ruling over the necks of the nations”; being determined by “of the na
tions,” this is sovereign, while in the Aw. passages the subjects are only
soldiers. The truly excited gloss depicts the dread the soldiers of the
spaSa feel for their commander-in-chief, vanant a.vanamna resembles
Arab, al-muzaffar al-mansur. Those are not notions of a prehistoric, not
even of an archaic period. The verses are surely younger than the con
quest of Nineveh and not older than the Achaemenian period.45
The stanzas 108-111 are in good condition, but not all there was.
The verse with rayasca hvarnasca in 108 has no correspondent in no;
on the other hand, in st.37 we have
avi dis ayam xsayamno a#yam barati 0wiyamca
and similarly in st.23:
mi#radrujam martiyanam #wiyam (ava) barahi [xsayamno]
43 saSra = sasSra, to Vsanh-, to command; the spelling may be a transposition of OP. *0as 0ra
>
*0as(s)a into Awestic, with s for 6 and 6r for s. But note the gen.sg. sat(a)rs in Yr.9,31. 44 In Yr.io,26 Mithra is kamrSa.gan, “who has power over life and death,” the foolish addition of devanam makes of it “the skull-smiter of the deva.” Wb. explains kamrSa itself as
“was fur ein (scheusslicher) Kopf”—while it is simply “skull, head” to kamara (see under
‘ArdvV and ‘Architecture’) —and kamrSa.gan “auf den devischen Kopf schlagend”: “was fur eine (scheussliche) Erklarung!” 45 In nob, the ed. has duciSram, K15 duziSram; since it is opposed to istlm purushvaSram, no other reading but istlm duz.aSram is possible: the archet. had s for z, wrongly interpreted as Aw. c, the aleph in the joint was dropped. Gr. dva-firap.

These verses call for association with the “Questions,” and the inade
quate subj. mood of barati—emended in Wb.937 to barati—proves it:
st.37 has been transposed from 2.p. subj. into 3-p. indie., whereat the
a of the subjunctive was overlooked. In the stanzas 108-m we have only
the positive baxsani and pati.da#ani; barani fits in as opp. to the nega
tive apa.barani. The original of st.37 was a simple
‘kahmai affyamca 0wiyamca azam barani xsayamno*
fhviyam, arranged in Wb. under V#wi-, Furcht erregen, noun
“#wayah, Schrecknis, gefahr”;46 but the superb #wiyanstama in Vid.
2,23—see under ‘Ardvi’—means “the most crowded,” and the original
meaning is “compressed, oppressed (in a tight, straits).” It is here
linked with “a(9 ya, ruin,” as is dve#a in Y.48,9 and 32,16, cf. Y.29,5
“yat mazdam dvadi frasabyo, crowding M. with demands.” (hviya
must be an exceptional spelling for +dviya.
St.62: yo noit kahmai mi^radrujam martiyakanam
ojo daSati noit zavar yo noit kahmai mifhadrujam
martiyakanam hvarno daSati noit mizdam
to be compared with st.63: 0wiyam ava barahi - - - xsayamno; and:
apa esam bazva ojo tuvam granto xsayamno barahi. All these sentences
paraphrase verses of our song, an original “‘kahmai ojo zavar mizdam*,
whom (shall I give) strength, force, (a soldier’s) pay” which appeared
once with baxsani as “given, allotted,” and once with apa.barani as
“taken away.” mizda is the pay of a mizdavar, soldier, Germ. “Soldner,”
from “Sold,” Arab, rizq sultanl < MP. rozig, which the men of the
djund receive.
Mithra is yazata, and his hu.yasti, the offering due to him, is accord

Lommel translates the duals “mit zwei Stuck (dieser Tiere) vereh

with the double accusative of the victims and the god to whom they
are offered: “tarn yazate . . . satam anumayanam, for him, her (acc.)
nn. slaughtered a hundred (acc.) sheep.” On the other hand, yasna,
zo#ra, vaca, naman, when used with Vyaz-, are always instrumental.
The end of the passage is metrical, and one cannot conceive why a verse
was added to the prosaic instrumentals, the less so as the idea is already
pleonastically expressed by two synonyms “birds—winged creatures.”
Obviously, the rules were originally a verse, with the sacrificial animals
in the acc.dual, in form of two dvandvas
:
+pasu stora vayi ftarta" yo parnlno fravazanti
The redactors have put the dvandvas—as they did in Y.i,ii with
mi#ra-ahura—in the dat.-instr. dual, and have interpolated on that occa
sion mazdayasna, for them a matter of course. But the Zoroastrians,
the true worshippers of Mazdah, were pledged not to worship Mithra.
The rule is pre-Zoroastrian. Remnants of analogous rules are preserved
in Y/-5,90-95: Anahita receives zo 0ra; people afflicted with crime and
shame are excluded from it; Y/.8,57-59: Tistriya receives zo#ra and
barsman, a white, a black or else a one-colored sheep, but no piebalds,
with similar exclusions as in Y/.5; for Vrthragna the same prescriptions
are valid; for Rtis, Y*.i7,54 the usual exclusion of infirm people. Yt.
i3,5of.: the Fravarti receive meat and garments. The redactors who
gathered these remnants had no longer an exact knowledge of the old
cults, but the gods mentioned had such old cults, while one cannot
assert the same of other gods to whom the Awesta dedicates a yasht:
some of them may never have had a cult at all.
The songs investigated so far reveal the picture of the god of light
as god of social order. Crimes against Mithra are nowhere secret, noc
turnal trespassings. Not the night-heaven watches over social law: the
night-watch is the moon. The whole is a function of a god of light. In
the “Theft of the Herd” Mithra is called “me(9anahya patar, protector
of the farm,” “vrzanahya hartar, keeper of the village,” who sustains
the pillars of the house, timbers its antae. In the “Peace-song” he gives
peaceful life as rama.sayana, in the “War-song” he is called ahura,
ratfesta, vispatis, dahyupatis and vispanam dahyunam dahyupatis. In
st.109, the “Questions,” he appears as commander of the army and
gives its command to whom he favors. He personifies, thus, all gov

ernmental, civil and military authority. In st.83 poor people and those
to whose rights prejudice is done, implore him. He watches over the
right, rtam, and in that quality he has Sroso and Rasnus next to him
on the chariot, and eight lookout men on the mountains. In Y/.io, 17-18,
he protects the house, clan, tribe and province of his worshippers; in
13,95 he destroys those of the mitfradruxs.
In Y£.io,2, where the mi#radruxs “brings ruin to the whole country,”
Bartholomae translated maryo mi#radruxs by “mithra-betriigender
Schurke,” Lommel “Unmensch.” maryo alone is “(young) man”; the
marianni are the army of the Mitanni Aryans; in OP. marika is slave;
when used before or after terms of profession it requires no translation.47
mi#radruxs is a very special term, and without defining it one cannot
understand the name Mithra. There is a number of synonyms. The
most frequent one is mi#ra.zya, to V zya, diya, jya- (see under ‘Hau
gava’), which means “deminuere, diminish, impair,” especially some
body’s rights. Hence mi#ra.zya “impairing a mi/9ra.” Another is awi.
mi#ri, i.e. “anti-mithraic.” A third, *mi 0ra.gan “slaying a mi#ra,”
formed like vrflra.gan, can be abstracted from Y1.10,2 “migrant ma
jjanya” and actually occurs, in corrupted spelling, at two places, Yt.
10,45 “yim isanti +mif?ra-jano,” and in 104b (see below), miflradruxs
itself is Ved. mitradruh, hence a pre-Iranian notion, continued by the
MP. mot savant mihrandruz (cf. late Lat. sociofraudus), whereas
TPahl. druxtmihr (MMed.) “perjured, sacrilegious” is a genuine word.
A striking fact which requires explanation is that in Y/.xo, 17-18 and
Y/. 13,95 Mithra’s favor or anger extend to the “first-born,” and that
in the “Questions” he threatens to slay the heirs of the offender. Sen
tences like “the mif?radruxs destroys the whole country” and the in
vocation as “acetar of the miflradruxs” make the meaning clear, acetar48
belongs to “kena, revenge.” In Yr.9,18 Husravah is called the “son of
Syavrsa, who executes the kena, revenge for the treacherously murdered
father upon Frahrasya,” and the “kenan, avenger, of Ayrerafla”; in Yt.
15,28 Krsaspa calls himself “kenan of (my) brother Rvaxsaya.” The
son and the brother take blood-revenge, and in kena = 770007 one has

the only word attesting blood-revenge in Iranian. The words seta.cinah, narl.cinah, which

long since recognized the IE. word for blood-revenge. Mithra, the ace
tar, is the avenger, the god of ius talionis.
The Mithra yasht contains a fine poem about the mifhadruxs, more
exactly the nasta.razista; st.104, which belongs to it, has been discussed
above because it gives the date of the poem: 612-550 b.c. At least three
fragments fitting together are preserved.

Sequence of verses
:
The train of thought has no gap, the joining no faults. It is clear
enough that the rel. yahya in 104a relates to mi#ro in 19b, not to
mi#radruxs in 19c. The two dushvarna (imprecative, see under ‘Hvar
nah’) in 105 are resumed by duzda in 52; dusvarstam in 105 by ayavars.
manyate in 105 is continued in 19 by manyu patipate. asato in 105 is

480
related to fradvarati in 52 : the criminal cannot remain at one place and
must hide. Isolated as it is in the yasht, st.52 has no purpose: the har
nessing ydjayati, receives good meaning only when the starting, uzjasati,
in 19 follows. And st.19 alone contains no reason for Mithra’s wrath: it
is roused by the attempt at escape. The verses 104 c-f with east, west,
north and middle, specify nema in st.19, and 105 a-b answer in the nega
tive to the hope of the criminal expressed in 105 (c-h, beginning), and
are therefore the conclusion.
Vocabulary:
+nasta.razista in 105a: Bartholomae supplemented to a nasto
razista, written with separation (instr. instead of ablat.) here
and in Yt. 10,27 ( text below), “pa#a, vom gradesten (Wege)
abgegangen.” Wb. 1515 discloses his reasoning: “razista, a) von
pantay in Yt.io,y, b) ohne pantay, das aber hinzuzudenken ist,
in Yt. 10, 27 and 105.” Yr.10,3: “razistam pantam daSati atars
. . . yoi miffiam noit awi.druzati” is part of the editorial intro
duction; the words of Yt. 10,27 “Mithra takes away the razista
from his enemies” make the redactor think of rtahya pantam,
and he infers that the god probably gives to his friends what
he takes away from his enemies. One must not repeat the error
of the redactor who has wrongly “hinzugedacht” panti in Yt.
10,3. The whole expression goes back to pre-Zoroastrian antiq
uity. V nas- does not mean “abgehen von,”49 but belongs to
Lat. nex, pernicies; Ved. “nasana, annihilating” to nasay-, Skr.
nasana “getting lost.” Gath, nasyanto rtat in y.32,4 “those who
sin against rtam.” It is the stem of MP. vinas, NP. gunah “sin.”
And razan are the leges or the mores:
Yr. 10,27:
yo dahyaus ransayanffya
para +razista barati
pati hvarna varayati
apa vrfhagnam barati
Mithra who from the countries
hostile
to him takes away their razista
(acc.pl.)
makes inefficient their luck (plur.)
carries off their victory . . .
49 “To deviate,” cf. Germ, folksong “L’b immcr Treu und Redlichkeit . . . und weiche
keinen Finger breit wm rechten Wege ab,” also Arab, wa-la tamall ‘an al-‘adl, “do not deviate from justice” in a letter of Tahir I to his son, in Taifuri, kit-Baghdad fol.15.



MITHRA 481
+razista is the elative of razan. The faulty case endings of
nasto razista indicate that it is a dismembered compound—cf.
sahvar.marista under ‘Last Judgment’—superb *nasta.raza,
formed like “nasta.zmana, who has lost his livelihood”
(Duchesne §207) ; hence it means “who has lost his rights,” in
the superb either “lost completely” or “his highest rights,” one
who has suffered the capitis deminutio maxima. It must be
taken in its most intense, legal, not in a vague moral sense, for
it is connected with asata.
Y*. 19,34 describes Yama xseta after his banishment from
paradise (text under ‘Yama x^3’) as asata: “Yama roams
peaceless, asata—prostrate in misery he hides—over the earth.”
Tha'alibi transfers the motif to Kai Xusrau: “wa saha 1-ard, he
roamed about on the earth.” It is the curse of Cain, G<?«.4,i2:
“And now cursed be Thou on earth, ba’aras.” The Pahl. transl.
of Y.29,9 renders Gath, xsanmane, life as xenos, exile, by asad.
manisnlh, peaceless-living; Germ, “friedlos” in medieval law
means ban, excommunication from the clan and loss of all
rights. Cf. Grimm, Rechtsaltertiimer 397IL: “Ein Totschlager
wird ‘friedlos,’ urspriinglich nur der eines Stammesgenossen,
nicht der eines Fremden, da diese exlex sind.”
ahvaya in 105b, written ,ai)uhaya‘, with insignificant variants,
archet. ’hvy’, is loc. of “ahva, soul, heart, feeling.” It may be
right—cf. “dausmanahya, in misery”—but it is tempting, with
regard to the passages quoted, to read +ahava, loc. in a of ahu,
archet. ’hv’, asato ahava, as in Gen.4,12.
awi.druxtaye in 105c: cf. Benveniste, lnf.av. 55: n.abstr. awi
druxti [cf. an.adruxti under ‘Yama’] “tout (ce qui est fait)
pour la tromperie.” It means a wilful injury, scelus dolosum.
To the entire thought compare the verses 92-104 of the book
Enok, quoted under ‘Last Judgment.’
fra.dvarati in 52a, with #warta gama, can only mean “to run
forth = away,” Germ, “fortlaufen” as in Yt. 11,6 and perhaps
more often. Also where it means “to run in advance” it has the
connotation of furtiveness.

which must be mi#ra-. Therefore it can be neither a corruption

The redactor, who tore the poem to pieces, further maltreated these
verses by adding, in st. 106-107, in verbose commonplaces his own
thoughts to those of the nasta.razisto, [much reduced] : “I on the con
trary think: no man on earth who could think, talk or do evil [the
usual triad each time in extenso] in as high a degree, as Mithra does
the contrary; no man who owns greater innate intelligence and better
hearing than Mithra!” Wolff annotates only: “! ?” I believe it is the
only instance in the Awesta where the diaskeuast speaks in the first
person and all but steps out of his anonymity.
Thus, the mi#radruxs, the one “who injures the mi 0ra” is “sacer”
and the word means “sacrilegious,” like TPahl. druxtmihr. As nasta.
razista he has suffered the capitis deminutio maxima, is outlawed,
“vogelfrei,” according to the old vehmic formula “der leib ist frei
gegeben den vogeln in den liiften.” Mithra is the god of blood-revenge,
and the miflradruxs are offenders against the ethical foundation on
which society rests, the nmana, vis, and zantu. All members of these
groups are bound and united in avenging these crimes. The punishment
strikes not only the criminal himself, but his house, clan, tribe and the
firstborn. Blood revenge, indeed, can “destroy the whole country”:
“Hir hat daz maer ein ende, daz ist der Nibelunge Not!”
Th. Mommsen, in his treatise “Zum altesten Strafrecht der Kultur
volker,” 01 defined as subject to blood-revenge “crimina publica, der
Gemeinde zugefiigte Schadigungen, die nicht als Notwehr (Kriegs
fuhrung), sondern als Vergeltung des Bruches der dem Gemeindever
band zu Grunde liegenden sittlichen Verpflichtung von der Sippe
geahndet werden.” These words of Mommsen, who was not in the least
thinking of things Iranian, give an exact definition of the Iranian no
tions, a proof of their extreme antiquity: mifha does not signify “con
50 The spelling -v.’v- at the point of junction originated when separation of the joints and the unetymologic -6 before the joint were introduced, here into an original spelling -r’j-; this involved the interpretation of the ending as -ai)ho, while its n is an etymological one. 51 "Fragen gestellt von Th. Mommsen” etc., herausgegeben von K. Binding, 1905.



MITHRA 483
tract, Vertrag,” it is the “moral obligation upon which the society was
founded.” Ir. drug [IE. *dhrewgh-, ’dhrowgho] does not signify “lie,
deceive” as in the Germanic branch, A.S. driogan, OHG. triogan, but
“to injure”; mi^radru^s means “injuring the mi#ra,” exact syn. of
mi/9ra.zya, mi^ra.gan. The concept comes quite close to Zoroaster’s
“zita.rta, by whom Rtam is diminished, impaired,” where the ethic
principle supplants the social group. The crime is aimed at the obliga
tion towards the social unit. The obligation is imposed either by descent,
or by a forsworn covenant. The form under which such a miflra was
concluded is known by the so-called Fravarani in Y.12, where an arya
man, client, takes the oath upon his entry into a vis. Every mi#ra
imposes reciprocal duties, is uwaya, as is an Arab ‘ahd, Hebr. berit,
“covenant.” Thus the inexact and insufficient translation “contract” is
pardonable; of Bartholomae’s definitions only “religiose Bindung”
holds, if one takes “religious” in its old Latin signification.
The total of the mi#ra (pi.) is the rtam in the pre-Zoroastrian usage
of the word. Zoroaster detached it from the “mores,” the traditional
customs, just as he detached religion from cult, and—“worshipping in
spirit and in truth”—transfigured it thereby in the absolute kosmos, the
moral law, ethical order of the world.
In fact, there is no difference between the Ved. n.pr. mitra, mitrah,
m. “friend,” and the Iran. n.pr. mi#ra, nor between Ved. mitram
“friendship” and the Aw. m.sg. mif?ra, the Gath. pi. mi#ra. The god
bore the name Mitra already in the Aryan epoch, not as a pale personi
fication of the notion “contract”—and not even in the true meaning
as one of the “covenants” that all together form Rtam—but as “the
friend.” In NP. “mihr, love, friend” the original meaning is maintained
to the present day. The words in the beginning of the Karnama\ Art.,
“he made mihr u dostih with Ardashir” have the full sociological mean
ing of Rom. societatem et amicitias, or as OIr. miffia and rvaf?a. If the
“akataro aceta,” the wholly-bad avenger, bears the name “Mithra,
friend,” this is the same phenomenon which leads to the name Siva for
Rudra in India: for fear of causing ill-luck one does not pronounce the
evil word, the avadya.
These social institutions come down from immemorial Indo-Euro
pean antiquity. It is with them as with words: just as linguistic corre
spondence proves that words belonged to the aboriginal language, thus



MITHRA
484
traces of such institutions prove their age and origin. O. Schrader52
gave two such sequences: Got. heiwairauja “master of the house,”
Germ. ‘hiwa, to Lat. civis, Skr. slva “dear,” hence the family as “asso
ciation of friends”; in Rome, with the transition of the gens into civitas,
the civis became citizen. Or: OHG. wini “friend,” Irish fine “clan,”
Lat. vin- -dex “bail.” That is the cultural soil on which also Ir. mi 0ra
grew.
These concepts are shared also by peoples not of IE. language. Exod.
20,5-6: “I, the Lord, thy God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of
the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation
(Luther ‘Glied’) of them that hate me; and shewing mercy unto the
thousands, of them that love me and keep my commandments.” This
is said where the ten commandments are announced, and once more
in 34,7, where the new Decalogue is given. The “four generations”

the “thousands” as their opposite mean infinity—come from the Ius
talionis, and correspond to the four generations in direct line of the Ira
nian naba.nazdista, or the four groups next to the “master of the
house.” In the Mithra cult asna frazanti and fratamaSata take their
place. “Those that hate me” and “that love me” correspond to awi.
druzati or ranxsyant, and an.adruxta or an.awidruxta, also to the op
position of duzbrtam and hubrtam baranti. The analogy shows clearly
why just the songs to Mithra are composed in such antitheses.
Zoroaster’s lament in Y.46,5 is a description of himself as nasta.razista,
proscript, in the old Roman sense, or as “vogelfrei” : “He who receives
the fugitive as xenos, be it the xsayans, satrap, or a hozantus, co.
civis . . . , a rasna zivans, one who lives according to the razan, leges,
mores, shall speak as his advocate for him—who as xenos has no voice,
no vote—before his peers, to protect him from xrunya, murder.” He
makes an appeal to people who adhere to polytheism and to whom he
has not yet exposed his doctrine. He therefore uses words belonging to
their notions of right. The words razan, rvati and mi 0ra just in this
gatha prove the pre-Zoroastrian character of the same terms in Yt.w.
razan, leges, are, with original congruence of right and custom, the
mores, resting on rvati and mi#ra. rva#a means “friend, amicus”; the
52 Sprachvergleichung u. Urgeschickte 1906, 1,2 03 f.



MITHRA 485
subst. fem. rva#a in 17. 12 means amicitia.53 The mores, in Roman, are
founded on amicidae, foedera and societates; reladons like marriage,
clientela, military retainership are in Rome societates, in Iran mi#ra.
Xrunya is more than “violence.” It belongs to the Ir. word for blood,
Aw. xfu, like Gath, xrura in Y.48,11 and xrunra (referring to the kill
ing of Gomata) in Y.53,8. It is at least “murderous deed” and is, like
kena, acetar, one of the terms of blood-revenge.
Zoroaster is threatened by murder, because the acts for which he was
sentenced and banished were subject to the ius talionis; he is banished
as “mi#radruxs” according to the moral notions of his own time. Such
are the “zur Unhaltbarkeit zugespitzten Zustande” (Nyberg) and the
“zeitweilige Zerwiirfnis mit den Sippengenossen” (Lommel). The
members of the clan are bound in duty to protect each other against
revenge. Therefore Zoroaster accuses his bandva, brother-in-law, the
ahura, lord justiciary, of not having protected him against the verdict
of the tkesa, the judge, Bartholomae’s rabbi. Not finding the protection
with his relatives—except his cousin MaSyomaha—he takes asylum with
Rtam, and implores the hospitium, which includes protection against
revenge, of another vis in another dahyu. That, and not a night’s rest,
is what the alleged “Buhlknabe,” the kavi Vehviya, refuses to give,
and what Vistaspa gives him. Therefore, finally, he says in Y.46,4 : “He
who robs his enemy of his dominion and his life prepares as leader the
path of Cistis” and in Y.53,8: “the zita.rta shall be one to-be-deceived
. . . who will bring murder and carnage upon him?” data, law shall
replace revenge, but in this case selfhelp, deceit and murder are not a
sin, but prepare the path of the religion.
mi^radruxs in pre-Zoroastrian language signifies what Zoroaster

who rejects Mithra and never uses this term—calls drugvant, Darius
drojana, “follower of the druxs.” There can be no congruent word in
modern languages, nor for the opp. rtavan. “Liar” is totally wrong.
Meillet and his school translate “juste” and “just and unjust, or right
eous and wicked” when taken in the archaic Biblical sense, e.g. Eze\.
18 (see below), come nearer than any other words. From the syn.
mifka.zya, by introducing rtam as collective of all midra, Zoroaster
derived his zita.rta, raising mi#ra.zya to the highest power, “who
53 Cf. under ‘Hospitium’ and ‘Last Judgment.’ Bartholomae translates rvati, Pahl. transl. dostlh, by “foedus” or “fides,” which fit miflra equally well.



MITHRA
486
diminishes, impairs the highest right,” which after the creed “must be
increased, rtam sudyai!” zita.rta is a syn. of rtat rariso—see under
‘Bandva’—and at the same time the reverse of the pre-Zoroastrian no
tion nasta.razista “outlaw.” One can plainly see, from which pre
existing conceptions Zoroaster derived his ideas: first of all from the
cult of Mithra.
He makes Mithra himself a nasta.razista, in taking away from him
his razan and conferring it on his AhuraMazdah, as he does with Rtis,
Sroso and Rasnus—whose relation to Mithra resembles already the
Zoroastrian “aspects” of AhuraMazdah. Rtis “chose right” and there
fore was adopted by AhuraMazdah; as the late Yt. 19,16 has it: “Your
father is AhuraMazdah, your mother Armatis, your brothers Sroso,
Rasnus, Mithra ( !), your sister the Mazdayasnian Religion!” Zoroaster’s
rtam is no longer the traditional custom, but the social order and the
kosmos, based upon the ethical dualism of good and evil. Thus, from a
social it becomes the moral principle: the absolute Good, rtam vahistam,
an expression that replaces the not used elative of rtam, Ytistam, and
comes close to Aristotle’s avroayaOov.
When custom and right are founded on a religious principle, the
notion of the offender against society goes over into “sinner.” Zoro
aster does not and cannot use the word mi#radruxs, and his term drug
vant cannot appear in a pre-Zoroastrian passage. It can only be interpo
lated in order to give a pre-Zoroastrian passage a Zoroastrian coloring.
The two words, therefore, are “index fossils” for the knowledge of
the stratification of the Awesta.
For this argumentation the words of the gatha Y.31,18 are conclusive:
a zi dmanam visam va soiflram va dahyaum va adat
dusitaca markeca
“(the drugvant) plunges house, village, district and province into mis
ery and destruction.” At no other place but here does Zoroaster use the
four-step formula for the social structure. His models were verses like
10,18:
yazi dim awidrujad frasa upa.scindayati mi#ro . . .
uta nmanam uta visam uta zantum uta dahyum,
which must have been familiar to himself and to his hearers.
Equally plain is the assonance—not to say allusion to Yr.10,2:



MITHRA 487
mrncati vispam dahyaum maryo mi#radru^s. . .
.
But Zoroaster replaces the term mitfradruxs of the older language
didactically by his newly coined drugvant.
The polar opposite to his ethically newborn rtam, the principle of
Good, is the Druxs (fem.), OP. droga (m.), the principle of Evil, sin.
A universal monotheism replaces national polytheism, and—exactly as
in Ezekiel—the ethical relation of the individual man to this god sup
plants the cult of their gods by a nation. There can be no mi^radruxs
any longer, but only “followers of the druxs,” drugvant. Without the
substitution of the dualistic principle for the originally congruent
notions of right and custom, an expression like OP. drojana, “man of
(the principle) droga” is impossible: this term alone is enough to prove
the Zoroastrism of the Achaemenids.
At the same time this explains why Zoroaster removed Mithra: he
is the god of the old social order, the legal foundation of which was
the ius talionis. The era introduced by Zoroaster brings monotheism
instead of polytheism, ethics instead of cult, and instead of self-help
a law, data, that was no longer founded on the social, but on the
religious concept of Good and Evil. Only a few years earlier the same
phenomenon happened in Judaism. Already Jeremiah, 31, 29-30, speaks
prophetically of the “New Covenant,” Ir. mi#ra, in which the proverb
“The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children’s teeth are set
on edge” will have no validity. And not much later Ezekiel (18) says:
“The word of the Lord came to me ... ye shall not have occasion any
more to use this proverb . . . the son shall not bear the iniquity of the
father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son, but the
righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness
of the wicked shall be upon him!” That is the total revocation of the
idea of revenge in “I, the Lord thy God am a jealous God.” And in
this archaic sense, righteous and wicked would be the best available
translation for rtavan and drugvant, just as “those that hate me” or
“love me” in Exod.20, correspond to the Mithraic terms.
For other reasons, Meillet compared, at the end of his Trois Confer
ences the historical role of Zoroaster with the Jewish prophetism. Eze
kiel lived in Babylon after the fall of Nineveh; his lifetime must have
overlapped that of Zoroaster. Certainly there was no direct contact, but
thoughts are ripe at certain times and in certain lands. The judicial and



MITHRA
488
moral conceptions, handed down from immemorial antiquity, were
passing away, and Zoroaster removed Mithra as the god representing
those ideas of the past. The historical development is the same as that
expressed by Matth.5,17: “Think not that I am come to destroy the law,
...
,
I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill,” and Rom. 10,4: “For Christ
is the end of the law” and Hebr.S,iy. “that which decayeth and waxeth
old is ready to vanish away.”
Very unexpectedly, the gatha Y.48,4 has been interpreted as alluding
to Zoroaster’s attitude towards Mithra:
yo dat mano vahyo mazda asyasca
hvo denam syo#naca vacahaca
ahya zosan ustis varnan hacati
fhvahmi ^ratou apamam nana ahat
“He who allows his will to be now good, now evil, and his soul to fol
low in conduct and talk its pleasure, its desire and its free choice, shall,
according to Thy decree, stand apart at the end (of all things).”
Bartholomae: “Wer sein Denkan (jetzt) besser macht (und
jetzt) boser, und (ebenso) sein Ich, durch sein Tun und Reden,
(wer) seinen eigenen Neigungen, Wiinschen und Uberzeugun
gen nachgeht, der wird nach Deinem Ratschluss am Ende der
Dinge abgesondert sein, namlich von den Glaubigen, die ins
Paradies kommen, aber auch von den Unglaubigen, die fur die
Holle bestimmt sind.”
Lommel-Andreas: “Wer sein Denken (bald) besser macht
(und) bald schlechter, der folgt seiner Natur mit Werk und
Wort, seinem Gefallen, seinen Wiinschen und seiner Wahl.
Nach Deinem Willen wird er zuletzt abgesondert sein.”
“Uberzeugung” won’t do: no prophet could ask people to
follow what is not their conviction. Vvar- [IE. welo-, wolo-,
Goth, wiljan “will,” waljan “wahlen”] is “to choose,” the noun,
here and often, “choice, arbitrariness.” Lommel has a wrong
construction, taking hvo as the usual pron. dem. or pronoun of
the 3rd pers.: a man doing the contrary would likewise follow
his nature. There are the verbs “who makes . . . follows . . .
shall be.” The inseparable triad “think—speak—act” is dis



MITHRA 489
tributed among “dat, he makes, allows” and “hacati, he fol
lows”; the power of the rel. yo reaches as far as hacati. The
acc. denam is shifted into the second clause, where it ought to
appear in the nominative; the relative is not repeated, but
resumed by the refl. hvo instead of an enclit. pronoun: “who
allows his will to . . . , the soul (acc.) of that (man) follows”
means “and his soul which follows . . .” or “who allows his will
to be . . . and his soul to follow. . . .” The comparatives express,
in mutual relation, “now good, now evil,” i.e. unprincipled, not
“undecided, vacillating.” nana “here and there” has the meaning
“neither here nor there.”
Nyberg interprets this stanza, 242: “wendet sich an die Unschliissigen,
die es natiirlich auch in diesem Stamme gegeben haben muss.” Natiir
lich for what ? “Aber der Schlag zielt defer : er soil Mithra in der Per
son seiner Anhanger treffen.” The gatha does not contain a hint at
Mithra. “Im Mithra yasht [10,26 and 29] heisst es: ‘Du, Mithra, bist
aka, bose und der beste . . . bist ein arger Richer.’ Die Bezeichnung der
guten Macht als aka ‘bose’ muss im Kreise Zarathustra’s wie eine Blas
phemie geklungen haben.”
Thus the undecided ones, who like Mithra think bad or good, as it
is opportune, become “Mithra-Verehrer, und ihr Stamm die Mithra
Gemeinde, in der Zarathustra jetzt wirkt.” The “Mithra-community”
is the product solely of this deduction. Thereby, Mithra would be the
god of irresolution, but the men are not irresolute, but refuse to let
principles rule their actions, and the god is just as “bad and the best”
as “I, the Lord, thy God” in Exodus. Zoroaster himself says, with equal
blasphemy, in Y.33,2: “He who is aka towards a drugvant, is quite to
the taste, zosai, of AhuraMazdah,” and in Y.47,4: “you shall be aka
towards a drugvant, even a rich one! ’ “For he is himself a drugvant
who wishes a drugvant wrell” (Y.46,6).
Nyberg continues: “Die str.48,4 ist ein Meisterstiick schonender und
doch wirksamer Polemik gegen eine zentrale Anschauung; man
beachte das sicher absichtlich unbestimmte und schwebende nana!”
Dante’s verses, are almost a translation of the gatha:
coloro
che visser senza infamia e senza lodo.



490 MITHRA
Mischiati sono a quel cattivo coro
degli angeli che non furon rebelli
ne fur fedeli a Dio, ma per se foro.
Aw. nana means “per se foro.” Nyberg: “Zarathustra passt sich weit
gehendst den Anschauungen seiner neuen Freunde an [who had forced
him to leave his home in desperation], aber in einem Punkte ist er
unerbittlich : man kann nicht bose und gut zugleich sein.” Mischiati
sono, every man is bad and good as well, whatever scale we apply to
these qualities. About the same time Heraclitus said: ayadov koX kclkov
ev iaTLv, and Christ says, Mar\ 10,17: “Why callest thou me good?
There is none good but one, God.” There is not and can be no such
infantile saying of Zoroaster, because man’s being “mixed” of good
and evil is his fundamental idea. In Y.30,4 (text under ‘Yama’), the
two primordial principles, Good and Evil, make themselves the motive
powers of the world’s history, which for that reason is called “gume
cisn,” a “mixture” that dissolves itself only at the last judgment into the
victorious Good and the vanquished Evil. Mani has done no more
than elaborating this thought of Zoroaster.
P.2ggt: “Mithra scheint sich nie von dem Schlag [nana!] erholt zu
haben, den Zarathustra gegen ihn richtete, wenigstens muss er
gegenuber Sraosa, der seine Rolle iibernimmt, zuriicktreten.” This pic
ture could be completed: After the chief of police got Mithra’s post,
the sleepless god of the night-heaven used his leisure to go bathing, to
Aix, Andernach, Baden, Capri, Herkulesbad, Sassoferrato, Wiesbaden,
and wherever he has left his traces. Did the Roman legions love him
because he too was not always good ? The passion which Nyberg makes
him suffer is worse, akatara, than that which the magi inflicted upon
him in Y/.io, see ‘Return of the Gods.’ But to assume that Mithra, who
in his beautiful hymn renders all the blows of his enemies abortive,
was so heavily hit by Zoroaster’s little word “nana!” would be the great
blasphemy : kavrov ov Swarcu craxrcu.
All over the Indo-European and Semitic world, when retaliation was
replaced by wergild, taxes for disbursements were developed. Y/.io,ii6
furnishes an example. mi#ra has there the connotation, discussed above,
of “obligation inside the community.”



MITHRA 491
“The mi#ra, societates, are valid
20-fold between two hasa suftidrnga. business-friends

1,000-strong between two dahyu, provinces,
10,000-strong between the mazdayasnian

20- to 9ofold is expressed by multiplicatives in -vant; 100
to io,ooo-fold are composed with -yus, according to Bartholomae
“100-fachen Halt bietend,” Lommel: “von 100-faltiger Dauer,”
supposing composition with -ayu, as in dargayau. Support or
duration are out of question, the ending can only be a factor of
multiplication. Therefore I attach -yus to V yu- in OP. yaumani,
from *yuman-, i.e. “with the power of a hundred etc.,” syn. of
“-fach, -fold.”
For suftidrnga Bartholomae guessed “Gaugenosse ?” for
huyayna “Stubengenosse.” Maf. al-ulum and Oamiis explain
Arab, suftadja, or suftah [from MP. *suftag, OP. ‘suftakaj as
“money-order or the like, which one sends abroad in somebody’s
favor.” Rather frequent in Tabari: When al-Mu‘tazz, threatened
by murder, asked his mother Qabiha for money to pay the arrears
of the Turkish soldier’s pay, she, who had over three millions
worth of gold pieces and jewels in only one of her safes, an
swered: “Just now I have no cash, only safatidj, bills; if I shall
be able to cash them, I shall give you something.” suftag is
air/yp^V and with sufti Aw. suwra is connected, see under



492 MITHRA
‘Yama xseta.’ drnga is OP. (han)dunga, Altplnschr. s.v., some
thing “confirmed” by a seal, cf. han.draxta, MP. andraxt =
tr^payto-ros, and *drahma > Spaxpp. Therefore it means
something like a business “firm.” suftidrnga recalls the xpzotyv
Xcuce? or crvyypa(]>o<f>v\aK£<5 prominent in business of the Seleu
cid period.04 They are people with mutual business and money
relations, like Murasu and Sons in Nippur, and one could trans
late suftidrnga straightway by “bankers.”
+hoyaxna means “of the same liver,” i.e. “blood-relation,” see
Duchesne Comp.av., following Krause, and under ‘Social Struc
ture.’
The paragraph is a tariff, inserted into the Mithra yasht for the sake
of the word mi0ra, originally a tariff for redeeming revenge by wer
gild, then generally for the calculation of penalties, by the cazdahvant,
amar vicartar (see under ‘Last Judgment’). Like the paragraph on the
six kinds of “vows,” mi0ra, in Fz'i.4,2, discussed above, its origin is a
law code. The late priestly redaction is plainly visible in §§60, 70, 1,000
and 10,000: the students and professors must simply be neglected for
the reconstruction of the original condition. They are a group inter
polated also at other places, e.g. Y.18,12: hasamca havistanamca e0ra
patinamca. The position of dahyu (1000) should be at the beginning,
as the broadest and therefore cheapest unit, value 10. suftidrnga, value
20, is a relation looser than fellow-citizenship; standing between dahyu
and vrzana, it has been substituted for an original zantu—hence Bar
tholomae’s guess “Gaugenosse.” From there on, the values rise regu
larly from vrzana “township” to “father and son,” value 100; the nar
rower the units, the higher the values. The mazdayasnian religion is
out of place: the formula is not “within a unit,” but “between two per
sons”; the religion cannot be doubled; moreover, all the rules are only
valid inside its limits. Whereas, as the widest group, the religion ought
to have the lowest number, it has the highest, 10,000, against logic, only
because in the feeling of the redactors it crowns everything. The corrupt
conclusion seems to contain the formula: “thus it was, is and shall be.”

MITHRA 493
The conditions of high antiquity, when the vis was the group to
avenge all offenses against the mores according to the ius talionis, were
probably no longer in full force, but in a phase of transition at Zoro
aster’s time. But his conception of law is as deeply altered as that of
religion. From his time on, crimes are acts directed against the ethical
principle, their punishment takes place “through data”—just as the
revocation of his own sentence—in* a criminal procedure regulated by
public laws.
The book of Esther says, 1,19: “If it please the king, let there go a
royal commandment from him and let it be written among the laws
of the Persians and the Medes, that it may not be altered—and the
king’s order which the king shall make, be proclaimed throughout all
his empire!” 50 This passage depends on Daniel 6,8. There, the royal
edict is called teqlm asara, the sending of the letter tirsum ketaba, that
it may not be altered di la Fhasnayah, just as in Arabic decrees Qur.
11,188, the curse on whoever introduces a change, is regularly quoted.
The law itself is called “dat maday u.paras, the data of the Medes and
the Persians,” and “not to be violated, di-la ta‘de’,” as in 17.10,17 noit
awidroxSo. The “proclamation” is the frasastis.
Herodotus says that it was Cyrus who constituted a highest court of
appeal, and the Demotic Chronicle 36 records an order of Darius to the
satrap of Egypt, to codify the laws there. What was ordered for a sub
ject country was probably already done at home. In Altp.lnschr. 151,
s.v. framatar, I had assumed, in view of the judicial tenor of Darius’
tomb inscription, that the words “Oramazda invested me with xra#us
and arvastam,” the very qualities of a judge, meant that Darius had
created, when organizing his empire, a Persian Corpus Juris. This is the
one which in Daniel is called the “inviolable law of the Medes and the
Persians.” The Darius inscription makes it plain that the “data” of the
king were no arbitrary acts, “nema kama tya skofhs tunvantahya radi
mi#a kryesa, nema kama tya tunva shores radi mi#a kryesa, tya rastam
ava mam kama, It is not my pleasure that the lowly suffer injustice on
behalf of the lofty, nor that the lofty suffer injustice on behalf of the
lowly ; what is right, that is my pleasure.” These words reveal an admin
55 The style of talking; to the king in the book of Esther is entirely true: there are many parallels in Tabari: “If the Commander of the Faithful would deign to send forth ... it would better be done this way . . .** etc. 56 Demotische Chroni\, ed. Spiegelberg, Sb.Pr.Akd.W. 1915, 304-309.

istration of justice without regard to social order and status, that means
a new one superseding the old law based on it. That is Zoroaster’s doc
trine replacing the legal notions embodied in the Mithra cult.
Codes are no inventions; they codify things existing, subjecting them
to a dominating idea. Chapters like the tariff of Yr.io,n6, in which
retaliation is redeemed by disbursements in kind or money, or like Vid.
4,2 on the six covenants, also the “surgeon’s tariff” in the Videvdad, see
under ‘Hdma,’ and some other passages may be the last remnants of
original parts of this code, and give us at least a faint idea of it.



XXIX. FRAVARTI
Under ‘Memorial Document’ the second part of the Fravardin yasht
has been discussed, to which actually its heading refers: “We bring
offerings to the fravarti, souls, of the rtavan, deceased faithful, of the
prvya.tkesa, first followers of the law, of the naba.nazdista, the next-of
kin” of Zoroaster and Vistaspa. This document found a place in the
Fravardin yasht, because the many names were recited in masses for
the souls, prescribed by Vistaspa’s waqf, and the fravarti are souls.
The first part of the yasht, §§i-86, has nothing in common with that
document, it is merely a description of anonymous fravarti, either of
how they look or what they do. This description has so many archaic
features and so many affinities with Roman manes and Germanic val
kyrs, that it must come down from a very old stratum of religious con
ceptions, from the highest Indo-European antiquity.
The mazdayasnian redactors have dissected the material at their dis
posal into small particles, only in st.1-19 a longer context remains. They
adopted the ever repeated pattern: “We bring offerings to the fravarti
who . . .” These sections belonged originally to hymns, sung at special,
mainly military occasions. Herodotus tells of Xerxes’ army “sacrificing
to the heroes at the Skamander near Ilios.” And since the term “hamas
patfmedaya, muster of the army” occurs in the fragments, this festival
was certainly a regular occasion for celebrating a “fravardin yasht.” 1
A yasht means sacrifices and songs. A short rule for offerings to the
fravarti, preserved in Yt. 13,50, differs entirely from those valid for
Mithra, Anahita, Vrthragna, Rtis and Tistriya (see under ‘Mithra’).
The fravarti receive “meat and garments,” a highly archaic gift to
“manes,” and in no way connected with Zoroastrism.
Form or contents of the fragments offer almost no clue for recon
structing their sequence, but altogether they convey a pretty complete
picture of what the fravarti were. The main means of describing them
are an accumulation of epithets, in which Yt. 13 is richer than any other
one.
The fravarti are female (st.29)

Former translations did not grasp the fact that this is a catalogue of
beauty, the oldest of the line that ends in 1001 Nights. Tabari and the
Aghdni2 tell: “The Persian kings owned a written description of the
(perfect) woman, and sent it around in the countries.” The Arabs be
lieved that it was a poem which al-Mundhir b. Ma al-Sama’ of Hira had
presented to Xusrau I, together with a slave-girl, fulfilling the ideal,
captured in his war against the Ghassanid al-Harith b. abi Shamir; later,
Xusrau II sent it to Nu‘man of Hira who, on account of it, fell in dis
grace and perished. Noldeke translates the corresponding verses of the
Arabic poem: “mit breiter Brust, gewolbten Briisten, diinner Taille,
schmachtig im Giirtel, von breiten Lenden, hohem Hinterteil, ihr
Gesiiss ist fleischig etc.” Since the verses of Yt. 13 describe only the body,
all explanations of the words from other spheres are ruled out from the
beginning.
Thus yona cannot mean “Statte,” but is the same as 01 . yona, and as
kanino vaSri.yona in Y^.5,87, cf. Wackernagel in kz. 46,267. brzi.yasta,
Gr. /3adv£,a>vos describes the upper part of the body, huyona the lower
part as obverse to hutosa. b is one syllable short, hence [hu]sro0ris in
parallel with hudoifkls, not (JVb.) vrzi.casman [vrzij.srofkis. The text
has dar76.r4ro.man, a corrupt spelling; 3 the correction results from
drya.bazu against eva.rma and from vazamna haca bazubyo in Yt.10,39
against asano rma.suta in Yt. 13,72; in analogy to OI. irma one expects

it. It was interpolated from a different context viz. st.23 (where it
follows the five compounds with -rta, soon to be discussed)
:
“<ya zavya) varjhufhvesu <ya zavya) vr£?raynyesu (ya zavya) prtanahu,
who are to be invoked in v., in v., in battles,” and: “(ta zi) strtesu
barsmohu zavya (ta) vrfhaynyesu (ta) prtanahu, they are to be invoked
at the spread barsman, they at v., they in battle.”
Those are typical products of redaction, looking like verses without
being it. The brackets separate what may be an old remnant.
Darmesteter’s, and similarly Geldner’s translation of varjhufh
wesu by “conquete des biens,” and Bartholomae’s “Blutvergies
sen” are merely inferred from the wrong context. The redactors
took the zavya formula from st.20: “yas.#wa . . . paf?am jasati
vanfhveso (or: van^weso), if a v. stands in your way (or you
tremble with fear of death in other dangers),4 recite by memory
the charm. . . There, van#weso is (Wb.): “Herden nachstel
lend, vanfhva + *isa, to Ved. gav.isti, Rindersuche, Raubzug,”
also to awistar in Vid.i “who makes a quest, a raid, Arab,
ghazw, incursione hostili petit hostem.” vaphufhvesu in 23 is a
corruption of it: an old formula, in which vanfhvesa or ‘van
fhvisti were linked with vr#raynya prtana, victorious battles, has
been dissected into three parts of a sentence, vrOraynya prtana
into two parts in 13,27. But there is neither a word vanhufhva
nor a noun vrfhaynyam, n., “battle,” and Y^. 13,45c speaks
neither of “lichtumflossenen, bathed in light,” nor of “licht
gepanzerten Schlachten, battles armored in light.”
Only roxsni.awiSata remains as an isolated epithet descriptive of the
fravarti, for which Darmesteter, with good sense, had tried “in bright
garments.” An abstr.n. awiSati appears in Y.9,6, verses of inferior style:
at ahya ahi awyasto barsnus pati garinam
drajanhe awiSatisca gravasca manffrahya
Bartholomae withdrew, in ZAir.Wb. 175, his former interpretation in
favor of Geldner’s (Sb.Pr.AkdW. 1903, 422) : “mit diesem (Giirtel)
umgiirtet, bist du (Homa) auf den Hohen der Berge, fur alle Zeit,
sowohl ‘Hiille?’ als Stab des mantra.”
4 Cf. Ogmad “if a dragon, a bear, a highway man, a whole hostile host stand in your way etc.,” under ‘Krsvar.’

Lommel, zii,m,i69f., interpreted drajarjhe as drazahe, 2.sg.
med. “you hold firmly,” in comparison with Yt.5,123: (ardvi)
patiSanam drazimna. But then the acc.sg. gravas.ca is offensive,
and the construction of the sentence is overloaded. Pahl. (and
Skr.) transl. took drajaqhe—like Geldner—as “forever.” The
hills are not the place where Homa receives the belt, but where
he grows, a parenthesis: “(you who dwell) on the heights of
the hills,” and one could read Mrajyapho, compar. of drya, used
as positive > NP. diraz, here adj. to barsnus “the far and high
hills.” 5
Without the parenthesis the sentence is: “girded with it, you are
awiSati, ‘wrapping’ and grava ‘wand’ of the mantra (song or charm).”
awiSati and grava apparently belong to the equipment of the conjurer,
the first is something he “ties round” his head, like Gr. KprjSepvov,
from Kapa, Kpa<s (head) and Sew “to tie,” whether hair-dressing, hood,
or veil. In “zaranya.awiSana, with golden wrapping” and in “awiSata.
trsti, wrapped in t.,” the word awiSana—related to Ir. patiSana and Gr.
diadema (it would be *amphi.dema) —refers to the artificial dressing
of the forelock of the horses, see under ‘Tistriya.’ Therewith, roysni.
awiSata “wrapped in radiancy,” epithet of the fravarti, becomes a
synonym of the epithet of Hekate, Xi7rapoKp7jSe/xvo?, in the Homeric
hymn to Demeter. awiSana may be a veil round the forehead, or pos
sibly plaits—the women wore two at both temples and ears6—or even a
wig. The Sasanids wore golden wigs. Surenas, the victor over Crassus,
in Plutarch’s description, set out for battle with make-up and artificial
hair-dressing. In the Persepolis sculptures, hair and beard of the kings
were painted or inlaid with lapislazuli, picturing an artificial hair
dressing, if not wigs. Such a custom may be the remnant of primitive
war-paint, and would well fit the picture of the fravarti as Wagnerian
valkyries.

FRAVARTI 499
The five compounds with words for “force” as the first, and rt “fight
ing” as second element,7 describe the fravarti as female warriors. The
first epithet, when translated “viel-bringend,” would not fit into the
group. In good verses the comp, in -rt would all count for four syllables,
and the many ya—suspicious apart from that—would be subsequently
added, except for the ya before trisyllabic hu.rto, which, then, must
have been the first. When as.brto moves away from its present first
place, its ya falls, and it becomes one syllable short, as.brt is improbable
in itself : as designates a degree only and is badly fitted for composition
with bar-, a trans. verb, without object: “much-bringing” is nothing. It
should be either 'asa.brt or *aspa.rt. OP. asabara survives in aswar,
suwar “horseman,” though Med. aspa supplanted OP. asa in proper
names already during the Achaemenian period. Mixing of dialects
being as old as that, an OP. asabrt can appear in the Awesta and would
provoke a wrong interpretation, like as.brt. *aspa.rt would be “fighting
on horseback,” *asa.brt “riding on horses.” Probably the fravarti were
thought of as marching as well as riding horses or chariots.
St.26:
ojista vazantam the strongest drivers,
rail] is ta fravazamnanam the swiftest in driving
V
vaz-, vehi, may apply to different ways of moving; but here it means
apparently driving a chariot.
I take also sparadasta and amuyamna razistanam in st.35, which
stand alone without context, as military epithets.
amuyamna, to which Hertel, Siegesf. 141,7, compares the Ved. divine
epithet amura, is certainly no moral quality. What “cannot be moved,
shaken” are not the “straightest (paths of Right)” (Wb.) but the ham
yanta, #raxta or rasta rasmano (Y/.io,8; 14,63 and 43), the “phalanges”
of the army, spaSa, of fravartayo puru.spaSa. Cf. st.26: “Iram a.frar
visyat, the column that never turns the back.”
For sparadasta Darmesteter said “qui porte le bouclier,” Geldner
“schildgewappnet” (shield-buckled). Bartholomae rejected this for two
7 Cf. Altp.lnschr. 291 and 312. Bartholomae, W^.192: “ich wurde -amt- ansetzen, wenn mir a als Kontraktionsergebnis von a and 3 sonst bekannt ware.” Aw. a is no real sound, it would be contraction of a and r; the Aw. spelling -ar- results from archet. -‘r-, notation of initial r of second element of compounds; same in OP.: -a-r-, e.g. Gath, zita.rta, OP. xsava.rsa; perhaps
armati. El. ik.se.*r.sa and Gr. Septus < *£vpf>n, with -aya.f- > e.r, rules a.f > ar out, for *Xsayarsa would give xsarsa.

reasons: (i) as epithet of Rtis the word is used beside purushva#ra in
Yt. 19,54. This passage is much too inferior as to postulate on account
of it a similar meaning. (2) The long a prevents connecting spara and
NP. sipar. Therefore Hertel, Siegesf. 50,3, advanced “spara to Skr. sval
‘eilen’: prominent by speed.” The old translations were based on Hesy
chios’ arrapaBapai yeppofiopoi, “shield-bearer,” such as are often repre
sented at Persepolis. I cannot admit the whole argument: it means
overestimating the quality of the textual transmission. And even if the
a was long, the conclusion would not be safe. OP. writes huvsp=
hvaspa, Med., an old compound; h u va sb ar = hu.asabara, OP., a
neologism; and hu v ar s t i k = hvarstika, not hu.’rstika > *hurstika,
hence simplex arstlka, “lancer,” from rsti, against rstibara “lance
bearer,” cf. *arSika (rSi) > all (silver-money); 'darlka (Sari, gold
piece) > AapeiKOs. Ctesias has dcrri/ldpa?, Akk. astebariannu, -ana
deriv. of *arstibari; hence one may posit ’sparabari.8 The younger lan
guage replaces the old compounds with -bara, OP. rstibara, va 0rabara,
by such with -dar, the stem with which Bartholomae compared the
-dasta of the Frhg.Ev., and to which (spara)dasta may belong.

+aftaye (text: apataye) to Vap-, and apagataye are, like avahe, the
very outcries, not “um einzuholen ruft (sie) der Verfolger,” but, with
Benveniste: “a la poursuite! a la fuite!” Meaning and meter would be
improved by transposing:

In 65 they come:
purvis purusata by many many-hundreds
purvis puruhazahra by many many-thousands
purvis purubevano by many many-ten-thousands
or in “companies, regiments and divisions.” The units are the regular
organization of the Achaemenian armies. Therefore another epithet
of the fravarti, in st.29, dasadavatls, is also to be counted in this class,
not “reich an Besitz” (Wb.) unfit for tusnisaSo, but dasa#a, perhaps
*dasa#wa, is the decuria, hence “in(many)decuries.”
In st.49 they come to the muster of the army:
ya visaSa avayanti who come flying from the vis
hamaspadmedayam pati to the term of the muster of the
ratum dasa pari xsafno army, for ten nights.
The nights are the five intercalary days before the new year, navasarSa,
and in the parallel passage in Vic.Den.21 the text has the right “panca,
for five nights.” The fact that they come “from their vis,” the home of
their clan, shows that the hamaspaffrnedaya,9 was not a muster of the
standing army, but of those reservists that were liable to service, but
lived “domi” as haxman, auxiliarii. The OP. formula in NiR b,3o, is
vi#iya uta spa^medaya, corresponding exactly to Lat. domi militiaeque.
The fravarti are “auxiliariae.” As such they are called in 30:
husha^mano huvarzana the good vassals, the good
townsmen,
apa.sitaye vahista the best as neighbors.
In 29 they are called tusnisaSo, a word expressing where they were
believed to abide: “Who live in [the land of] silence,” in the tomb
under the earth, near their former home, visaSa of 49. The Aryan sandhi
form tusnisad, neither *tusnishad, nor *tusnihad, indicates the high age
of the notion: a time in which the dead were still interred.
St.42:
ya +uzbata manyusuta who, when called out, marching
through air,
frasusanta +barsnau {avahe) asno set forth over the height of
heaven
9 As to the etwnologs: meJa may belong to Vmid-, like hamid-, mya&tra, myazda, all meaning social unions. In AltpJnschr. I adduced some reasons for spa#- > MP. spase or MMed. spah “sen ice.”

Bartholomae: “uzbata for us.zbata”; Lommel: “+hu.zbata.”
The latter is wrong: Vzba- is the call for mobilization, cf.
Aydt\.Zar. §3 under ‘Post and Travels.’ Following the call they
rise from the tusnisad and travel through the air. One might
read +zuvata, as in Y.33,5. avahe spoils the meter and the sense.
The predication is not that they come to help, but how they
answer the call, manyu.suta is not “vom Geist angetrieben”
to Vhu-, which is not “antreiben,” but to Vsyu-, su-, and
manyu “heaven.” Text: barsnvo, trisyllabic, Bartholomae: “gen.
for abb,” is not a grammatical but a graphic problem: loc.
barsnau or instr. barsnu, bisyllabic as required.
St. 67:
ta yuSyanti prtanahu

ya(9a aso me#anamca
awi.sitaye daSara
ya#a na ta^mo ratfesta
hushambrtat haca setat

They fight in the battles
for their own town and canton,
where they have retained town
and farm as residence,
like a swift chariot-warrior
fights for his well-garnered
property, girded with sword
belt.
“retain, daSara” can mean both: they keep to the place where they
had lived, or they remember it. In both cases, like the manes, they are
tutelary genii of their homes.
St.46:
yat (his) antar vato fravati
bara.boSo martiyanam
te naro patizananti
yahva [asti] vr^ra.boSo
If the wind blows between them
carrying the scent of men,
they smell the warriors
with whom [is] scent of victory
(his) is unnecessary and a consequence of the dissecting of the original
song. The smelling of victory is a remarkable archaic idea.
St.63:
ya ahurahya xsayato who fight on the right
dasinam upa yuSyanti of the king.
ahura are men risen from the warrior class; it is the word that comes
nearest to “king” in Iranian, especially when xsayant is added: ahura



FRAVARTI 503
Xsayant is the satrap, who is a “king.” The fravarti fight “on his right,”
whereas one expects them to protect the left and not to impede the action
of the right arm, the reason why, with us, the younger man lets his
senior go right. Here it is not a question of expediency, but of rank,
based on the notion that the right is good, the left bad. The custom is
Babylonian, e.g. “RittiMarduk (of Luristan), captain of the king’s
chariots, whose place was at the right hand of the king, his lord” in the
kudurru of Nebuchadnezzar I (1146-1123 b .c.).
10
St.18 promises to the commander-in-chief of the empire, sasta dahyaus
hamaxsatfro (later Eran-spahpat), who by his offerings hubrta barati,
wins the favor of the fravarti, that he will become the most victorious
ruler among all men, ho ahati zazustamo xsayo kascit martiyanam.
St.26:
airarvisyat krnavanti they make never-turning
the-back
Iram yahmiya jasanti the troup among which they
march.
Darmesteter’s translation of a.fra.rvisyant was right; the question in
the song of Rtis, see under ‘Notarya,’ is conclusive: “zam avi ni.rvisyani,
shall I turn my back upon the earth?” iram is the column in march,
as opposed to rasman, the phalanx. The fravarti, marching among
them, do not let them flee. A similar thought is expressed by amuyamna
razistanam, where the “straightest phalanges” are unshakable.
In st.65-66 and 68, the fravarti work for their own vis, as in 67:
65 : at yat apo uzbaranta when the rainwaters rise
zrayahaSa vurukrtat from the sea Vurukrtam
frasusanti fravartayo the fravarti set forth
purvis purusata etc. by many centuries etc. (see above)
66: apam esimna havai endeavoring to seize the waters
kacit nafai havayai vise each one for her own family, her
clan,
havai zantave havayai dahyave for her canton, her province

try
10 L. W. King, kudurru vi, col.1J.26. The “officer on the left” was the second in rank, and a “third” was an aid-de-camp. The origin are the three men on the chariot. The custom went on with the Mongols and in China.

niSateca hosateca decay and dry up ?
68: (at yasca aham) nivanante having obtained the waters

clan,
havai zantave havayai dahyave her canton, her province,
uti ojano: hvepaflya no dahyus thus speaking: Our own country
fraSateca vardateca shall flourish and prosper!
At the beginning of 66, the meter, spoiled when the verses were
inserted into the yasht, can be restored by shifting esimna (or isimna)
between nafai and havayai. St.68 has suffered more, because the wrong
interpolation of st.67 made the words “at yasca aham” necessary. The
words “frasusanti . . . apam esimna, they set forth to seize the water”
demand “after having seized them, they conduct them . . .” which
could be restored. The words they say resemble what Darius says in
Bek. §55:
yadi avaf?a manyahe if ye think thus:
dahyausme drva ahati My country shall be intact!
This is a verse. The El. version transcribes “taiosmi trwa asto,” a
phrase of seven syllables only, with the OP. imperative “astu” not
documented in the OP. texts. This seems to be the traditional formula,
and ahati seems to have supplanted astu in the OP. text “metri causa.”
The thought appears first in the Akkadian legend of the “King of
Kutha,” time of Sargon of Akkad. Cf. also Y/.6,i, under ‘Krsvar’: “a
hundred thousand yazata come, when the sun brings warmth by its
light, to distribute the hvarnah [here a water produced by light, else
where a fire produced by water] among the creatures.” The 100,000
yazata are certainly 99,999 fravarti.
Another side of the fravarti is their cosmologic activity, described
in st.56-58. These three stanzas follow one pattern of composition, and
in confronting them one sees at once all the changes they have suffered
from redaction and transmission.

The waters (in 55a) are called “mazdaSata,” and likewise the paths,

is immediately followed by “baga-destined course.” Those are no ele
gant variations, but incompatible notions of two hostile religions, and
therefore cannot be contemporary: dure.rvesam is the genuine word,
mazdaSata was introduced instead by the masdayasnian redactors;
bagabaxta proves the original conception as pre-Zoroastrian. “mazda

Sata” causes suspicion in many places, and there are some where it sup
planted “damidata.”
Instead of the other mazdaSata in 53a, as epithet of the waters, the
plants in 55a have “hvawrlra, good for mowing?” or “giving good
hay”; hence, an analogous good quality of waters has been likewise
replaced by mazdaSata, and comparing the archaic verses in Y.Haft.
38,3, ahuraninam and hambavantlnam would fit character and meter.
The unbearable “zosai” verses fall away as additions, also asonls in
57c, which caused the disappearance of srlra in the same verse.
ya para ahmat histanta fraSata afratakusls in 53c-d, . . . afro^sayantls
in 55d, means: “which before stood still, created as not-flowing, not
upgrowing”; the stars have afrasumanto, “not-setting-out.” fraSata is
indispensable and must be restored in 57, where it is missing: “the
stars are created not-moving before (58) but now they move,” by the
toil of the fravarti. The interpolation “on account of the plots, the as
saults of the deva” is utterly foolish: completely misunderstanding the
clear sense of the verses the interpolator stops with these words the
movement of the cosmos, whereas the fravarti set the great clockwork
a-going, fresh from creation. Also daryam in 57 and the lines with
daryamcit, 53 and 55, are false: a speculation, whether and how long
the clock stood still before starting to work was entirely foreign to the
myth. Together with daryam falls anayranam rocaham in 57, for
“luminaries without beginning” contradict the clearly expressed
thought of their primordial creation, anayra is an idea of a much later
age.
The analysis results in a perfect analogy, almost identity, of the three
stanzas, with four verses each, on the stars (57), the waters (53) and
the plants (55). The st. 54, 56 and 58 agree with each other almost from
the beginning, except that 58 is mutilated and must be completed: the
fravarti show the course to the stars which before stood still, created
not-moving, but now they move, on the course with the far turn.
The structure of the stanzas requires pantam-yonam-afa^tam to be
three nouns of the same sphere, and the three compounds preceding
them, among them fra^warsta, to be descriptive adjectives.



FRAVARTI 507
yona appears also in Vid.21,5 (see under ‘Sea’), said of the
revolution of the waters, Pahl. transl. “advan, path, course.” 11
Vyu- is “intendere”; Ved. yuvasva “harness (imper.)”; “to har
ness” develops into “exert, strain” (pulling the traces); OP.
yaumani from ‘yuman, “exerting oneself, trained, strong.” In
Vrtra 5of., Benveniste defined “cheminer” as only signification,
but in J.As. 1936, 201, he speaks of “atteler” as “to be separated
from it.” I think the stem is one. Wb. divides the noun yona
into (1) “(bestimmte, fest zugewiesene) Statt, Statte,” refer
ring to the passages quoted above, where this is entirely prob
lematic, and (2) “Beschaftigung,” only in compounds. The
five examples for yona as end of a comp, which he gives, all
belong to V yu-, “to exert oneself”;12 the only example for begin
ning of comp., yona.hut, means “artfully building holes, i.e.
passages” referring to the fox. hv.ayona in Y/.i 6,3 can be either
“with good relay stations” or “well passable,” referring to roads.
The simplex yona—and the compound vrta.yona, see ‘Post and
Travels’ and ‘Astronomy’—is not “fixed place,” but implies al
ways the concept of motion, especially on a determined space,
and often “recurrent.” It is “track, groove, Teut. leisa. Germ,
geleise” and as movement “travel, Reise,” when applied to the
stars their “orbit,” as in the Pythagorean metaphor, Goethe uses
in the prologue to “Faust”:
Die Sonne tont nach alter Weise
in Brudersphaeren Wettgesang
und ihre vorgeschriebne Reise
vollendet sie mit Donnergang.
afa^t,13 “rich in water,” does not fulfill the condition de
manded by the structure of the verses, to be a noun, syn. of yona
and panti. In st.53, on the plants, where there would be some
justification for “rich in water,” the noun zrvanam takes its
place, qualified by the adj. fra#warstam. This belongs to #war
sah, fra#wrsa, term.techn. of racing, a “periodos” of the course,
11 Cf. H. W. Bailey, jras 1934, 505, on advan > evan “stem, stalk’’ as Pahl. transl. of varsajis Yr.10,5 and y.71,9. 12 V yu- is semantically close to V ha-, hi- “to harness, rope."
13 Same spelling in i'r.10,14: afant < *afvant < *ap\ant.



508 fravarti
e.g. in Vid.2,ig (see under ‘Chronology’) : “the first millennium
was a 0warsah,” finished period. Similarly in Yt.14,129—see
under ‘Ardvi’—yada.krtam dwarstai zrune, “the beaver skins,
appropriately prepared at the right season”; Y/.8 ,ii 10,55,
under ‘Deva’: #warstahe zruno and upa.fHvarstahe, “at the ap
pointed hour”; Fa/. 14, 13, under ‘ApamNapat’: upa. 0warsti,
beside biyarryti, “at the exact time,” referring to the two daily
irrigations of a garden. Thus “fra^warstam pati zrvanam, in
their prescribed time, period” is right, and afa^t is faulty.
Otherwise, the three stanzas differ mainly in their verbs: the stars
fravazanti, drive; the waters fratacinti, flow; the plants fravaxsayanti,
grow; correspondingly the stars were before airasumant, not-setting
forth; the waters a.fratakvah, not-flowing-forth ; the plants airavaxsa
yant, not-growing. This and a few other divergences—hvawrira;
ru#mis “roots” for pa#o—are intentional recasts. In the verses on the
plants the poet did not succeed in carrying through the analogy be
tween growth and movement: the growth does not follow a determined
“track.” The mutilated stanzas on the stars are evidently the original,
and first those on the waters, then those on the plants were modeled
after them. But just the verses on the plants have preserved zrvanam,
the authentic word, supplanted in the model by afa^t.
The verses on the stars ended with two lines missing at the other
places; 58e-f: the harnessed quadrigae of the stars are waiting for their
drivers, the fravarti, to start on their long rounds, aSwano rvesam
nasamna, and: yim frasakrtoit vahviya, “namely of the good ‘beyond
making.’ ” Bartholomae remarked “abl. fur gen.” The grammar is as
faulty as the thought. It is not at all the end of the world’s history that
the stars want to reach, but the turns of their orbits, again and again,
like a chariot that is driven nine times round the race-course; frasam and
frasakara are terms of sport. The line is a bad gloss, almost as foolish
as the gloss on the “assaults of the deva.” The noun frasakrti, a late
abstr. formation, appears at no other place, and since this one is a
gloss, it cannot be regarded as a genuine Awestic word. 14
The verses on the stars thus were as follows:
14 It is a transposition into Awestic of MP. fraskirt, see under ‘Last Judgment.’

Our long process of cleaning has brought to light fine old verses,
and as the parallel of the Tistriya verses, in ¥£.8,25, shows, their style
was typical of pre-Zoroastrian poetry. Under ‘Tistriya’ we shall deal
with the verses Y/.13,43-44: st.44 is the archaic original, which, in 43,
by a simple addition of “the fravarti let loose, start Tistriya on his
course” has been subordinated and assimilated to the thought of our
verses here. Yt. 13,60, too, where 99,999 fravarti guard the star haftaringa,
the “septentriones,” shows a related conception. The idea of such a
guard comes from the Krsaspa myth, where 99,999 awyaxsanti, stand
sentry, as awyaxstar, eTro-n-Tr/p. In st.59 this idea is transferred to the
ocean Vurukrtam—in connection with the verses in which the fravarti
distribute the rain clouds rising from the ocean—and in st.62, a late
imitation of those old verses, to the sperm of Zoroaster.
The fragments studied so far are dispersed over st.20-73, karda ii-xxii,
but karda 1, st.1-19, is all one continuous poem. It begins with “Spoke
AhuraMazdah to Zoroaster”:
1: eva te zavar ojasca
hvarno avasca rafnasca

Thus, of the strength and power,
of the glory, help and fidelity,

viSarayafm zara#ustra) (I, o Zoroaster) supported
avam asmanam the heaven there. . . .
and all the things AhuraMazdah supports with the aid of the fravarti.
In id the fravarti are qualified by the adj. rtavan; in ig they are “the
fravarti of the rtavan.” More striking even than in the adj. bagaba^ta
and mazdaSata, this is the difference between the original pre-Zoroas
trian and the late mazdayasnian notion.
The first thing supported is the “brazen heaven”—a bronze age con
cept, while asman, “stone” and “heaven,” itself is a stone age notion;
we have quoted the beautiful verses which describe AhuraMazdah
still as Varuna, under ‘Deva’: “I, AhuraMazdah, supported with their
aid the heaven, which Mazdah has put on as garment etc.” The illogical
sentence, typical product of redaction, makes the pre-Zoroastrian age
of the original only the more manifest.
In st.4-8—a patchwork compiled from Yt.5—Ardvisura, a girl of fif
teen who jumps from the highest heaven to earth in the picture of her
own yasht, is supported, as if she was a fat Zubaida who decked herself
out with jewels to such a degree that two slave-girls had to support
her. In st.9 it is the earth, on which (st.io) the waters flow in canals,
the manifold plants grow—fine old verses. In 11 it is the embryos in
the womb. To that point the formula in the first person, AhuraMazdah
speaking, is repeated.
A creator-god, imagined primordial, may create figures to aid him
in creating and supporting his creation. But the fravarti are no such
creation, but as old as the god of heaven and much older than the time
when he became AhuraMazdah. To imagine the fravarti as atlantes
is a wholly archaic idea, but not so the phrasing: “the fravarti helped
me, I supported by their force.” This is the mazdayasnian adaptation
of the primeval belief.
In gatha Y.44,3-5 (text under ‘Yama ) —verses one must read in com
parison with yt.13,53-58, to appreciate fully their relationship and yet
the deep difference of their style—Zoroaster asks: “Who has created the
sun—who supports earth and heaven—who holds the waters and plants
—who harnesses their racers to wind and clouds?”, namely Ahura
Mazdah, with no help of the fravarti. In these verses Zoroaster transfers



FRAVARTI 511
their cosmic role to his god and thereby deposes the valkyrs: “So kiiss
ich die Gottheit von dir!” And the redactor’s additions in Yr.13 are, as
in all the old yashts, the form in which the deposed ones were again
received within the folds of post-Zoroastrian, mazdayasnian religion.
A phrase like Nyberg’s “Yt. 13 ist so genuin zoroastrisch, dass die Verse
wesentlich von Zoroastriern geschaffen sein miissen,” could not even
be supported by the power of 99,999 fravarti.
From st. 1 1 onwards, the redactor got tired of always transposing
the formula into the first person, and now goes on using the genuine
formula where the fravarti act themselves without AhuraMazdah in
the third person: “aham raya hvarnahaca, by their r. and hv. (14) the
waters flow, the plants grow, the winds blow, (15) the females conceive,
they become pregnant, they give birth easily.” This genuine formula
occurs ten times; where it has been changed in the foregoing verses,
it must be restored, and the verses 4-8 on Ardvi must be eliminated.
Subsequently one recognizes, too, that the preterit in the changed for
mula is faulty, only the consequence of subordinating the entire song
to the idea expressed in the heading, that the fravarti “helped” Ahura
Mazdah at the creation. The original used the present, the activity
of the fravarti has nothing to do with the creation—entirely logical, for
the fravarti are the souls of men—but is a permanent one, after the
creation.
The concluding st.19 of karda 1 says:
i#a te zavar ojasca This is what, of the strength and
power
hvarno avasca rafnasca of the glory, help and fidelity,
framromi rzvo — I tell you
yat rtaunam fravartlnam of the rtavan fravarti
!
The correspondence with the beginning shows how easy it was to
adapt the verses to Mazdaism. Here, except the improper insertion, be
hind rzvo, of the vocative Spitama! for another word, nothing has been
retouched. And when reading the conclusion without remembering the
beginning, one would never think that these verses were addressed by
AhuraMazdah to Zoroaster, and that it was he that the fravarti helped.
Obviously, the poet addresses the hearer, and the fravarti, with their



512 FRAVARTI
strength and power and fidelity, help continuously the men of their
vis, not the god at the creation.
In these verses the genuine beginning and end of a poem is preserved.
In the beginning the poet says: “Such I will speak out, fra.mrava,” at
the end “This is what I tell you, fra.mromi.” Some gathas begin in a
similar form. This is not the beginning of a hymn, where the god is
invoked, but that of an epic tale. The literary form must go back to
highest antiquity, for it corresponds e.g. to Gr. TAiof aeiSco kcu Aap
Savirjv iwrcokov, or to Lat. “arma virumque cano,” and MHG. “von
kuener recken striten muget ir nu wunders hoeren sagen.”
A close relation exists between two stanzas of this poem, 15 and n:
15: aham raya hvarnahaca
harisis pu^ran vrnvanti
{aham raya hvarnahaca)

By restoring the 3rd person of the verbs in 11 b and e, the meter
becomes right. In the original song, as the contents require, 11 must
have followed 15. St.n is transposed into the 1st pers., AhuraMazdah
as subject; but for the second verb cod. Lb 5 has the significant variant
rvat.caen, i.e. rvacayan, a 3.p.plur. A similar relation—as to the contents

exists between the verses on the stars, waters and plants in st.53-58
and st.14, and one can imagine these stanzas behind 14, as n behind
15. The poem, then, would originally have been much richer than we
have it in st.1-19.
The ever repeated formula aham raya hvarnahaca shows that ray and
hvarnah, like on the other hand zavar and ojah, force and power, are



FRAVARTI 513
essential qualities of the fravarti. The adjectives revant hvarnahvant
are standing epithets of the star Tistriya, and transferred from him to
Satavesa. Alone, Aw. rayi appears only in Yt.6,^\ hvar yat amrtam
rem (acc.) arvataspam, probably as a genuine old epithet of the sun,
hvar xseta, agreeing with hvar^setahya amrtahya revahya in Yt.6,0
(and y.2,24). Since the adj. revant, too, is mostly joined with hvarnah
vant, the expressions seem to be derived from an old dvandva rayi
hvarnaha.
In Y/.io,io8, Mithra asks: “To whom shall I allot rayasca hvar
nasca?”; there, “health and wealth” stand in parallel with it, and in st.
no: “sickness, death and poverty” in opposition. It means apparently
“property and luck,” see under ‘Hvarnah.’ In the gathas rai appears
only once and alone, 43,1
:
“According to (Thy) will give us, (give) everyone—whom freely
ruling as He wills the Lord will give it15—Thou as Armatis, (give)
me, the rayo rtis, award of riches and the life in paradise!”
The prayer asks for reward in this and the other life, as in many other
verses, and Wb. translates, to the point: tt\ovtov fioipas. rai, rayi is
etymologically Lat. res. But in Yi. 14,27, where Vrthragna appears as
“nar revant,” opposed to the “youth of fifteen” in st.17, that means as a
mature man of 30, in full armor, and in Yit.14,36, an old soldier’s spell,
saying “no man be he ever so revant (Wolff-Bartholomae: noch so
prachtig) can hit him”—since indeed no magnificence or wealth can
be of any help—“riches” do not fit at all. The raya—res, there, can be
nothing but arms, of the “hoplites,” a syn. of zaya, e.g. in Vid. 14,9-10. In
Art.Vir.Nam. 14, the artestaran (ratfesta) are called gvrt’n zyn.’pz’r,
“heroes in armor,” apparently equal to nar revant. In Vid. 20, chapter on
©rita as physician, the paraSata (used as name of the pesdadi dynasty),
bear the epithet revant, beside “men of property” and others. The Pahl.
Vid. explains it by “afzarawmand, rich in afzar, resources,” almost “in
genium,” MP. carak = Arab. hlla. MP. kirrokih ut afzar means “arts
and sciences,” a semantic development resembling “rerum peritus” and
“rerum potitus.” In Vid.1,7 afzar translates Aw. “sura, strong” as epithet
of Marw. And in Vid.1,14, epithets of the Hilmand river, Aw. hetuman
tam revantam hvarnahvantam, Pahl. r’y’vmnd GDH.’vmnd, are com
mented by xvysk’r v tvxs’k mynvg sgst’n, “dutiful and industrious
15 Parenthesis, passing from second to third person.



514 FRAVARTI
genius (of or in) Sigistan.” Whatever their original meaning, this was
later the signification of the standing epithets of the fravarti.
Another significant and odd epithet is rtavan. In the original text of
Y/.i3,id—repeated in I3,i9d—rtavan is an adjective to fravarti. But in
the interpolated line ig they are rtaunam fravartayo, “manes of the
rtavan.” In pre-Zoroastrian usage, e.g. as epithet of the archaic dvandva
midra-ahura, rtavan refers to rtam in its original sense “law,” hence
means “loyal, righteous, just” in the old Biblical connotation. Likewise
as epithet of the fravarti: “the just, loyal fravarti,” a pre-Zoroastrian
idiom. Zoroaster, by opposing his notion “druxs” to the traditional
rtam, made rtavan the antonym of drugvant. In the subsequent Maz
daism this concept of rtavan took on the connotation “orthodox,” and
the rtaunam fravartayo of the gloss are the “manes of the orthodox.”
The small difference in the two all but identical lines discloses pre
Zoroastrian and post-Zoroastrian thought.
This phase was not yet reached by Old Persian in 479/78 b.c. as the
inscr. Xerx.Pers.daiv. shows: 1.47f.: syata ahani 16 ziva uta mrta rtava
ahani (l-54f. has the same in 3rd pers. with verb bavati). The Akk.
version, while translating “to be syata” by “to see dumqi,” does not
translate, but transcribes the term rtavan by artawa: 17 “Happy I want
to be in life, in death I want to be rtavan!” The wish corresponds to
Zoroaster’s words in Y.43,1: “Give me rayo rtis (in life) and paradise
(in death)!” or 51,7: “Give me amrtata harvata and tavisl utiyuti,”
both dvandvas opposing the wish for this and the yonder world.
Theopomp, in Plutarch, de hide 47, translates this term by evSai
fioves, Eudemus of Rhodus 16 by pa/captot, which is an excellent trans
lation for the OP. connotation. To pa/capios in the hereafter corre
sponds “syata = o\/3to<s” in this life, a term perfectly rendered by Akk.
dumqi lumur. Zoroaster himself calls both, the living and the dead,
rtavan. The difference between his and the OP. idiom gives a deep in
sight: the prophet to whom the victory of his religion and the “coming
of the kingdom” are the same event does not yet feel as contradictory
16 OP. ahani is an inverse writing of spoken *ani, for older *ahani; same case as avahana, spoken avana, old avahana. 17 Darius must have said something similar in the postscript of Beh. §§73 and 76: “hya auramazdam yadatai ya[\a tau]m[a ajhati uta zivah\a uta [mrtahjya - - - , he who worships Oramazda as long as he has the power [= lives], [of him, gen.], alive and [dead ].” lb Same place, cf. Ed. Mejer, Christent. 11, 69, n.4.



FRAVARTI 515
the two concepts of passing away into the beyond when dying, and of
a resurrection at the end of the world. And so, Zoroaster does not dis
tinguish, as Xerxes does, between syata and rtavan. Eschatology de
velops only after the death of the prophet.
Xerxes says “abide in the laws that AhuraMazdah has given, worship
AhuraMazdah as Rtam, and ye will be syata in life, rtavan in death.”
Since this is the reward for a moral life, the word is used with all the
ethical value, the implied opposition to drugvant-drojana, which Zoro
aster had laid into it. But in reserving rtavan for the beyond, OP. fol
lows the line indicated by the pre-Zoroastrian usage: rtavan was the
epithet of the manes, the fravarti, in the popular notion.
Therewith a few classical passages are explained. Hellanicus, Persi\a,
quoted by Stephanos Byz., s.v. artaia, said: dpraiov ? Se Ilepcrai ojarrep
oi "EXX'ijw? tov? 7raXaioi’5 avdpaiirovs T/paias kclXovo-l ; “heroes” in
the meaning of Lat. “manes.” Herodotus mi,37 calls the Fravardm
yasht, the magi celebrated on the Skamander before Ilios on the occa
sion of Xerxes’ campaign, “libations to the heroes.” Stephanos adds:
'HpwSoros apredra? avrov? KaXei. Our editions have: yevea ef £>v
(LXXoi 7rai're? aprearai Ilepcrai, on whom all the other Persians de
pend. The Greek rendering of rtava(n) by aprcuoi resembles Ctesias’
Aapeiaio? for dareyavos < darayavahus. There is no reason to explain,
with Markwart uge 1,66, dpraiot by (fra)vartayo. The Ir. name of the
month Travartinam mahya passed into the Cappadocian calendar as
Aprava, i.e. the gen. pi. rtaunam, because it was the month of the
rtaunam fravartinam. And Herodotus’ Median king Phraortes = fravar
tis appears in Ctesias’ Parsondas legend as Apraio?: rtavan.
Herodotus has also put into his report on the military review at
Doriscus, in 485 b.c., two remarks, either quotations from Hecataeus
(shortly before 500) or his own. vii,62: “The Medes called themselves
aptot,” and 63: “The Persians dpraloL.” The first is historical and cor
rect. The second is corroborated by Hesy chios: dp-aloi oi SIkcuol Trapa
Ilepcrai?. Sucaiot is the very old meaning of rtavan, and no inadequate
translation of the later mazdayasnian meaning. But with Herodotus
it would already be a religious name for the Persians, almost “ortho
dox,” and if so, could only be his own remark, since that could not be
said before his time. Hesychios has still: dpraSe? • oi Socaioi viro pdywv.
This seems to be a Greek plural of *apra? after MP. artay, arday.



xxx. ardvisurA anahitA
“Was verfolgst du meine Herder”
All cattle and all animals are, in Old Iranian mode of thinking, under
the protection of Ardvl, the goddess of celestial waters and fertility. She
was the “great goddess whose name is Lady.” Zoroaster condemned
and banished her together with Mithra, Vrthragna, Homa and other
devas.
Ardvi seems to mean “moist, moisture”; sura is etymologically Kvpirj,
semantically also norvia. The name Artemis is given to her as vorvia
0T)pa>v in the votive inscriptions of Persepolis. Her standing epithet is
anahita, the immaculate, whence Gr. ’Amm? and her MP. and NP.
name Nahid. Before Alexander’s time, the Greeks identified her with
Aphrodite Uranie. Herodotus gives this name to her as goddess of the
Scolotian Scyths, who associated her under the name ’Ap-yi/macra with
Apollon yoLToovpos. The second element of this name, -suro = /cfipto?,
is the same as in Ardvi-sura; the first, goito, is gavyuti “cow-pasture.” 1
Apollo goitosyros is Mithra vurugavyutis. The language was an Iranian
dialect.
Argimpasa: argim- with m < nt before labial, as in Ir. dat.
abl.pl. -anbyo of the -ant-stems, is a participle. So is ‘exam’ in
itjapiraLoi, Herodotus iv,52 = tpat 6801, discovered by Markwart
= Scyth.Oss. afsand < Ir. spanta, f substituting for ip because
of init. labial of the second element. Tedesco told me that
Varg- may be compared to Gr. alk- (alex-) “protect,” a root
represented in Skr. The second element is pasu-: fsu-, pecus;
hence, argim.pasa < ‘argant.pasu, type fradat.fsu, vidat.fsu, is a
surname of Ardvi of the same character as goitosyros of Mithra.
Evidently, the ethnic ’Apipaanoi in Aristeas’ Issedonian story is a
derivative of that surname of the goddess, though Herodotus, iv,i3,
asserts that it meant “one-eyed”: Scyth. arime “one,” and spu “eye.”
But arima is Gr. rjpipas “quiet,” and there is no spu “eye.” Arima.spoi
is stronger hellenized than argim.pasa: arima = argim-; the m demands
following labial, hence spu<psu; arimaspoi < *argim.fsuya, worship
1 Cf. YV.14,41: “Vrthragna who hvarno pari.vrnavati, makes rain (or fertilizes with) hvarnah upon the houses for the cow-owners, gosurab>o.”



ARDVISURA ANAHITA 517
pers of ’argim.pasu, hence their sanctity; the idea is expressed in Yt.
5,89: ‘‘through me pasu-stdra, small and large cattle find their sustenance
all over the earth,” and by Ardvfs epithet “van$wa.fraSana, increasing
the herds.” In the Demeter hymn: 17 <£ep/3ei im x^ovl vdvd' ottoct
i(TTLV.
To the Scythian ArdvI-Argimpasa the Greeks substituted their “Tau
rian Artemis” of the Orestes-Iphigeneia legend, and this goddess again
was identified with the Hittite mother-goddess of Komana in Pontus
and in Cappadocia; at a later period the Iranian goddess was also iden
tified with the goddess of Ekeleac-Akilisene, the Armenian region of
Erzinjan, called 17 ’Ar-ams x^P a> where a statue of solid gold, holo
spyratos, stood in a temple, carried off by Roman soldiers during An
tonius’ Parthian campaign, Pliny nh. xxxiix,82-83. Erzinjan is Old Arm.

aedif. fypovpiov ’Opocrr)vu>v, near south of YdraXa, i.e. Arm. satal, mod.
Sadagh. The annals of TiglathPileser I, year 2, render the Urart. name
by urusu in Haria, and the Sunassura-treaty by (Hitt.) urussa in Hurri,
a highly important fixed point for the historical geography of Asia
Minor in the second millennium.
The amalgamation one observes here of the Iranian Anahita with old
Anatolian goddesses has its parallel in Susa and Babylon, where she
became one with Nahhunte, Istar and Nanna.
The Ardvi yasht is an extensive one, but is in a bad shape and its
redaction was inferior to yasht like that of Mithra or Vrthragna from
the beginning. The interest concentrates on the old fragments it con
tains.
The goddess has no earthly home; in st.3, the introduction, she
“flows down from mount Hukarya to the ocean Vurukrtam,” and in
st.85, the conclusion—both belonging to the same late redaction—she
“comes from the stars there above down to this earth.” Her yasht con
tains more quotations from the epic than most others, and the form is
always a prayer of the heroes at their proper place. Thus, Yt.5 contains
the most complete topography of the epopee, but that, of course, creates
no connection of the goddess with one of the places of the heroes. To
infer, as Nyberg does, that one of these localities was the “home of



518 ardvisura anahita
the cult of Ardvi” and the place “where Yt.5 was composed” reveals a
total miscomprehension. The goddess is ubiquitous.
In Y2.5,28-35, quotation from the ©retona myth of the epic, the place
of the adversary, AziDahaka, is called bawrois, in which Darmesteter
already recognized Babylon. Meillet calls this equation “evident,” see
under ‘Aneran-Turan.’ Nyberg, on the contrary, speaks of the “ver
meintliche Erwahnung von Babylon” and translates bawrois by “Biber
Land, beaver country”; 322: “Varona [of the Videvdad\ lag gegen das
Biberland hin, wo AziDahaka zu Hause war, folglich im Flussgebiet
des Jaxartes, weil der Biber der Ardvi heilig war.” She wore a beaver
fur, that is all. The argument has not even the value of Markwart’s
attempt—see under ‘Eranvez’—to identify Ranha and Wolga-‘Pa,
because the kara fish lived in it, perhaps the sturgeon. Were there
beavers in the Jaxartes and only there? Caviar and furs are no instru
ments for solving geographical problems. “Beaver country” would be
bawranam dahyus; bawrois (dahyus) would be “she-beaver country.”
“Wir befinden uns also jetzt im aussersten Osten vom iranischen Stand
punkt aus”: no, in Babylon. On this “she-beaver-land” he bases the
theory that Y/.5 “in alien wesentlichen Teilen dem ostlichen Zoroas
trismus angehort und vor der Auswanderung des Zoroastrismus nach
Raaa und vor der Achaemenidenzeit entstanden ist.”
Babel and beaver are entirely insignificant for judging the age and
place of the yasht: the name has nothing to do with the Awesta, but
was AziDahaka’s place in the epic: he represents the Babylonian empire
at the time of the Iranian immigration. That which compels us to date
not only a redaction but the first composition of the main parts of Yt.
in the later phase of the Achaemenian period is the language and the
picture of the civilization which just this yasht clearly reveals. 2
There are two contradictory passages in which the goddess is pre
sented driving in her chariot.
St.13:
yahya cafhvaro vastara wrhose [chariot is pulled by]
four drawing [animals]
speta vispa hama.gonaho white ones, all of one color,
hama.nafeni - - - of one strain
2 Beside the passages here discussed, there are the st.5, 50, ini. 49 and 130, topical of Achaemenian period.



ARDVlsURA ANAHITA 519
Meter and grammar are deficient and what follows is totally deca
dent. If hama.nafeni and the following words brzanta tarvayanta are,
as it looks, duals, “four” must be wrong. Against Lommel’s “gleich
schnell” I consider hamanafeni as syn. of hamatar; Bartholomae re
marked: “nom.dual, Neubildung zum fem.stamm wie zarneni in st.
127; der dual, den auch die beiden folgenden Worter zeigen, passt al
lerdings nicht.” “Neubildungen” are out of question : when these verses
were put into the yasht, the language was dying or dead. The form
recalls the fern, patron, adjectives in -ani, -eni.
St.120:
yahya ca#waro arsano whose (are) four male (animals)
vato varo meyo fsanhus wind, rain, clouds, hail,
yahya avavat +zenanam whose (are) so many weapons,
nava satais hazahramca nine hundred and a thousand.
Glosses, interpolated to give the verses a mazdayasnian coloring, are
easily detected: “AhuraMazdah fabricated for her (the four animals)”
and “Always, o Zoroaster, they make rain for me, AhuraMazdah.”
Bartholomae, who took them as authentic, was forced to interpret the
common avavat (with gen.) “tantum,” as an exceptional augment pret.
of Vbav-. The text has “hena,” in d, a hapax, certainly not to be
maintained by adducing Gr. Iij/u, but a simple fault for +zena: the
“hail-stones” especially are the “weapons,” of which 1,900 are lying on
the chariot: the number means infinite, cf. st.4, where the Pahl. transl.
converts the “40 days’ marches,” extent of the seas, into 1,900 parasangs,
both “infinite.” arsano, here, contradicts the fem. hamanafeni in 13,
but there is nothing to show which of the two has more authority.
The animals must not of necessity be horses. In much later pictures, the
sun has a team of four yellow stallions, the moon of two white cows.
The distinction is certainly not a late notion.
St.n:
yo purvo vartam vazate Who (nom.sg.m.) first (m.)
drives the chariot
anxna drazate vartahe gripes the bridles of the chariot,
ahmya varte vazamna upon ? this chariot, driving (f.)
counting the men, thinking thus: who will praise me,
bring me offerings ?



520 ARDVISURA ANAHITA
The passage is ungrammatical. From the masc. yo purvo one may
infer that Anahita, like all gods, had a charioteer. The repetition of
vartam-vartahe-varte is bad, and if an^na means “bridle”—which be
longs to the animals, not to the chariot—the second vartahe is a fault.
St.126-129 give an entirely different description of the goddess, and
long since it has been presumed to be the description of a statue.3 The
first line, which was not accurately translated, raises this beyond doubt.
The stanzas differ from those quoted, because they do not describe an
imaginary picture of the living goddess on her chariot, but her statue
in a temple. Berossos records that statues of Anahita were erected under
Artaxerxes II in the temples of all provincial capitals, and the verses
with their bad grammar and meter may well belong to that time. In
the background of the Taq i Bustan, in the tympan, is such a statue,
over 12 feet high, and not only do the verses fit this statue, but the statue
elucidates some dark points in the verses. Therefore, though created
not before the beginning of the 7th century a.d., the statue can be used
as substitute for old statues lost.4

The most beautiful of creatures means the sun, and one may add
“huno” in the last line, as in Yt. 10,143. One sees that Anahita, too, is
described as the ideal type of the girl of fifteen years, in analogy to
Vrthragna as youth of fifteen years. Grammar and meter are bad, but
were so from the beginning; the verses were composed at a time when
the authors no longer mastered the language. One must not try to
correct them.
To st.126: fra.veSamna (or -viSa
), Bartholomae “die immer

ing sta- in auxiliary function. The MP. auxiliary originated
from a similar use of sta-, but it is auxiliary only with the past
part. Nowhere is a god “always visible” nor did any one “use
to appear” regularly. Instate means “she is standing (there),”
and fraveSamna “visible and palpable,” namely as statue in the
temple; cf. the usage of AiSamna, venamna.
uskat yasta, cf. brzi.yasta as epithet of the fravarti, corre

rzva^yo in 126 and 64, Had.N. has the clear brza#ya. Instead
of revat ci#ram it has revas.ci#raya. Bartholomae and Lommel
regard revat ciflram as parenthesis, badly fitting the verse; it
might be an acc. of relation; at any rate it is no real old lan
guage. The following vahanam is rather a wrong case of the
participle than an “absolutivum.”

“kline,” to V pas-. Lommel translates “reich gestickt,” as if read
ing -pista. These furnitures are “overlaid,” cf. 7Trjywfju, or “in

chain,” to V pas-, is also the warp of the loom, and puru.paxsta
is probably what later is called “hazarbaf, woven with a thou
sand (colors, or threads).” It stands beside zaranena like Gr.

aSka describes the cut, not the material of an overcoat,
whether just “cloak” is doubtful. According to Nir.92, one can
wear it aSaram or uparam, that is “with the lining outwards or
inwards.” That makes one think of a fur coat, yet it cannot be
the same as the bawrini vastra, separated from it in 129.
To 127: The ed. has ,baSa ya#a.mqm‘, P13 bata ya^amqm,
Jio bat ya 0a.m%m, L18 baSa yatfm^m. The corrupt spelling re
sembles that of daryo.r3r6.man in Yt.13,29 for + darya.rmano,
and midro.aojaqhd in Y/.io,io4 for "mitfra.jano. 5 There is one
syllable too many and the copyists did not understand the text,
m^m is apparently an attempt at correcting an acc.m. into an
acc.fem., b’tytm' 1”; cf. Yt. 9,31: humaya vrdakanaMca instead of
the dvandva humaye Ardanakeca, and here something similar
may be the reason. But since the words “round her neck” in f
make the only verb “barat, she wears,” in d, unfit for the objects
in a-b, these lines can only contain appositions in the nomina
tive, like "barsma.zasta, no accusative. The whole overhanging
syllable -m^m must be eliminated; only b'tyt remains and
must be something analogous to “barsma.zasta, barsman in
hand.” This word nowhere appears alone: in Y.62,1 people
pray to Atar “esma.zasta, barsma.zasta, go.zasta, havana.zasta,
fire-wood, barsman, milk, mortar in hand,” equally in Vid.3,1
when praying to Mithra. On the sculpture of Ardashir II at
the side of the Taq i Bustan, Mithra holds the barsman; the
statue of Anahita in the Taq holds die hydria as her attribute.
5 Bartholomae, Wb. posits for this word and for the adv. avi.mam in T

On the gold sheets of the Oxus treasure, of the Median epoch,
several figures are depicted with barsman and hydria or phiale,
jug or cup in hand. Among the objects of the treasure is a golden
hydria for libations of the Achaemenian epoch; from a similar
piece in silver comes the fragment with the inscription of
Xerxes, Altplnschr. n°i9. Flat libation cups are more numer
ous; the inscription of Artaxerxes I, Altplnschr. n°23, on one
of them, calls them batugara, see under ‘Homa.’ Athenaeus

silver,” and explains ftaTiaiaov TrepcriKT) Se 7) (\>ia\r) ySarid/o}.
OP. ‘batiyaka lives in NP. badiyah, which glossaries explain by
piyalah, i.e. ’pati.gala (= gara), as Benveniste has shown in J.As.
1936, 233. *batiyaka would be b’tyk, and so b’tyt must be
emended. The archetype had b’tyk brsmzst, i.e. batiyaka bars
mazasta, with ellipsis of zasta after the first word: “hydria (or
phiale) and barsman in hand.”

their husband, sitting on the well upholstered klines

Wb.1617 derives the signification “prunkend zur Schau tra
gen” for frasispimna from sispimna in Y/.i7,io: “the river Hetu
mant spetinis varmis sispimno, weisse Wogen aufschwellend,”
to Skr. sva- “to swell.” Etymology and signification are very
doubtful, cf. “spaya#ra” under ‘Astronomy.’ 6
In Y;.i7,io, minu is not (Wb.) an acc. dual, but the first ele
ment of a compound “minu(pisi) zaranya.pisi, adorned with
minu and gold,” the same case as +batiyaka barsma.zasta. Some
Mss. have menu, cf. mena.xan, name of a mountain “crystal
source,” NP. Arab, “mlna, crystal, glass, enamel,” and the topic
name Minab, crystal-water. Ca#rukarana spoils the meter in
17,10 and is probably borrowed from 5,127, where it seems to
signify the square shape of the mounted jewels, the usual shape
of semi-precious stones and the oldest of jewels.

In 129 a gloss is added after catur.zizanatam: “yat asti bawris
sraista ya#a yat asti gonatama bawris bavati upapo.” The text
is so close to being metrical that it must contain a small fault,
probably in the words ya#a yat. Meaning: the she-beaver is at
her prettiest, that means she is the hairiest, when she goes into
the water. The last two lines may also be an addition: frona,
i.e. prn, is either prna or frana (in zasta.frana.masah, as much
as a handful). The sentence seems to express: the skins shine
as if they were sheer gold and silver.
More notable even than the relation of the song of Yi.5 to the statue
in the Taq i Bustan, which was not suggested by that poem but is the
result of a sculptural tradition of more than a thousand years, is the
similarity of this description of Anahita with that of Aphrodite in the
Homeric hymn, where she visits Anchises:

As “mistress of the animals” Ardvl is described in st.89: “Through
me, Ardvl, they find their sustenance all over the earth, pasu-stora,
small and large cattle, and the tw'o-legged man: I protect all good
creatures, as it were, like pasum pasuvastram.” The verses are a late
passage, but the notion is old: in Greece it is the role of Artemis and
9 Bartholomae links petu:pi0va to Vpi-, but poi0wa as part.fut.pass. to Vspa- “to wipe out,*' “vvie \on einer a(y)-Basis” (Nachtr. p.1873). He translates Vspa(\)- “aufschwellen,” and one would expect anu.pctu, -poitfwa to Vspa(>;-. Something is wrong.

of “Gaia, the mother of all,” and the Scythian name of the goddess,
argimpasa expresses the same.
Wb. separates pasuvastra “cattle-shed” from a second word meaning
the “sheep’s coat,” a separation partly based upon a wrong concept of
fsu-, see fsuyo under ‘Harvatat.’ V fsu-, “fett machen” and the deriva
tions attributed to it, fall away. There is only fsuyant, fsonl and pasu:
fsu, and this last has still, as in other IE. languages, the meaning “wool
beast.” St.89 says: “I protect the animals as its woollen coat protects
the sheep,” and the mediocre poet thinks his metaphor to be so daring
that he adds most prosaically “so to say.”
Y.45,9: pasus vlran ahmakan frada^ai a
“Pour l’acroissement des nos hommes et troupeaux” is the old
dvandva pecudes virosque in Ovid, Umbr. veiropequo, cf. Benveniste,
bsos viii, and Inf.au. 46. It comprises all cattle, but the proper acception
is “sheep.” One reads often—in respect to asp u mart—the Persians had
kept horses in higher esteem than men. If so, the Romans would have
valued sheep higher. Only among Arabs have I met with such an atti
tude: “al-Hadjdjadj imported, from Sind, ten thousands of buffaloes
with their Zujt” as unavoidable appendages, asp u mart means men
and horse, the army. Cf. the Egyptian style, in the letters of Ameno
phis III to Kadasman-Harbat or of Burnaburias to Amenophis IV :
10
“May you, your house, your wives, your children, your great ones, your
horses, your chariots go on very well!” The last two are the cavalry
and the chariot-warriors, the army. In asp u mart, or OP. huvaspa
humartiya, asp and huvaspa precede because of the old dvandva rule:
the shorter word, and if the number is equal, the one wuth initial vowel
comes first.
The other dvandva, fsonl vanf?we, thus in the Yama myth ¥^.9,9-10,

the term for keeping wild beasts in preserves for hunting. A word as
old as pasushasta < ‘pasusasta, to Vhad-, *sed-, can only mean “pen,”
not “stable.” OP. rsada < ‘rsa.hada, a stud where stallions are kept,
is a corral, neither a stable, nor a “Mannerhort,” as Oppert, Justi, Foy
and Andreas translated it.
The fact that people in villages and towns kept a number of beasts
in stables is no contradiction. Vid.2,25 says, referring to Yama’s var,
“make a dwelling for men, a gavayana, stable for cattle.” And in Vid.
14,14 “house for cows” is a cow-shed. But that is valid for townsmen
and farmers only, not for cattle-breeders.
In the gathas and in Y.Haft, appears, four times, a strange looking
word fsaratu, fem., Wb.\ “Vergeltung, Belohnung in eschatologischem
Sinne”; Hertel recognized it as a bad spelling. In Y.35,12, vahu manaha
,fsaratum‘, he takes it as four-syllabic, in Y.51,4, ku#ra arois a .fsaratus*
as trisyllabic, eliminating the dispensable postp. a; and thus he arrives
at the reading pasu.ratu or pasur(a)tus. But fsu.ratus, fsu.ratum would
suffice. 11 In the interpretation “Ausstrahlung des Viehs (aus dem Licht
himmel)” I am glad to be at variance, ratu is the term for seasons; one
of them, the aya^rima fra.rvestrima, has the epithet vrsni.hrsta,12 Pahl.
transl. “ke vusn hilisnih pads andar ayet, time of the admissura arie
tum.” ‘pasu.ratu or ‘fsu.ratu, likewise, means a “sheep-period,” but not
that of the ram’s leap, but the “lambing time”; the lambs are usually
born early in March, "fsu.ratu is an o^eia, not “eschatological reward,”
but “fertility of the sheep.” In Y.33,12 Zoroaster prays: “As Armati
grant tavisim, vigor, as spanta give zavah, force, as rta give hazah,
power [the three words for ‘force’ need investigation], as vahu manah
give fsuratu, fertility of cattle.” In Y.Haft. 39,5 vahvya "fsuratavo stands
beside vahvya armatois, agricultura.
The obscure epithet of Druvaspa, “fsonimrza”—either fsu.nimrza or
fsonl.mrza—seems also to refer to dxetaiVmrz-, malidan is “coire”;
the deity may influence it as besaza, physician, or as god of horse
breeding.

Meat does not at all belong to a libation, gaus means “cow” in contra
distinction to “sheep”; no noit is missing, but payo refers to both;
cheese is not mentioned : “neither cow milk nor sheep milk.”
Thus we have discovered a number of terms which show that the
sheep-breeding of the nomadic tribes was just as important as their
cattle-breeding.

Only 2 and 3 are clear : “of that which is on the heights of the moun

the third. 13

country.

example Isfahan. Yr. 10,23: “you bring 0 wiyam avi hvepa#yas.
tanuvo, to the very body of the mi#radruxs” demands some
thing very definite, not a vague “Gefahr.” 6wiya is “anguish,
angustiae,” in this case “tightness of breath”— (opp. hvaftra, good
breathing) . 6wi- in general is “being in a tight, in straits, com
pressed, oppressed, thronged,” cf. Germ, “bedrangt, Bedrangnis,
Gedrange.” In Yz.10,23 and 37 0wiya forms pair with a0i, as
does dve 0a in Y.32,16 and 48,9: yahya ma a 0is dvef?a, Bartholo
mae: “cuius me (mihi) pernicies minatio (=minax est)”; Ben
veniste, lnf.av. 15: “dont la destruction me menace.” “pernicies”
is a doubtful translation of a#i, rather “pain.” Bartholomae
compared Sew'd?, SetSo>. At any rate, #wiya and dve#a are
synonyms, cf. Y.29,5: yat mazdam dvadi frasabyo, “mit Bitten
bedrangen,” evidently related to dve(?a. Hertel, though mistaken
in reading dabiyam for #wiyam, was right in regarding its 0\v
as exceptional spelling for dv-; the rare word was confounded
with #wi-:0wesah. dve#a, otherwise unconnected, belongs to
Vdvi- < 6wi-. The proof is #wiyans: 0wiyanstama, i.e. +dviyan
stama asah as opposite to mountains and valleys where men and
beasts live far apart, are the “most crowded, populated asah,
towns,” and the example Isfahan is right. At the time of the
commentary, after Shahpuhr II and not later than Xusrau I,
Isfahan was the largest town of Iran.
+upaxruma: text paxruma, one syllable short, belongs to
Xruma in Y^.io,8 “earth, soil”; adj. xrumiya, there and in Yt.
13,38, “sandy, stony,” see under ‘Mithra.’ upa.xruma “on the
soil.” The Pahl. translation, knt' rather than kvt', krt' m’n',

transl. take it, or to the else unattested V gay-, ji- “to nourish, refresh,”
Wb., it means “that are our sustenance,” fitting “aSyu, useful.” pasuka,
though used here in a wider sense, means originally “sheep.” Mutton
was an important part of animal food. Wb. defines datika, deriv. of
dant- “tooth,” as “wildes, nicht domestiziertes Tier.” The prayers of
fered to their souls and their “usefulness” restricts the meaning to
“animals hunted for food”; Gr.Bdh. calls the hare “ratu, chief” of the
datika. This cannot mean “carnivorous,” but, as in Islam, the permis
sion to eat may have been bound to the shape of the teeth. Often the
“five kinds of pasuka and datika” or “gaus pancahyaya” are mentioned,
to which prayers, zo#ra and barsman are offered. This rules out all
really wild animals of prey. Occasionally they are specified: upapa,
upasma, fraftrjat, ravascarat and cahrahak, living in water, on land,
winged creatures, those living in (or by) ravah, and those following
cahra. (4) and (5), in fact, specify (2), and the only thing common
to them would be that it was permissible to eat them.
In Yt.8,48, a bad imitation of the poem discussed under ‘Tistriya,’
this pentad is inadequately added to “yim vispe patismarante—aSari
zme upari zme, all that are under and above the earth.” In fact, the
pentad itself is a triad to which a pair has been subsequently added,14
and the original triad is the one familiar to every language. Gen.1,8:
“fish in the sea, birds under the sky, beasts on earth.” Much deeper in
Aristoteles, de mundo vi,40i: tu>v Se icov rd re dypia kal ppepa rd re

/cat (ftdeiperai rots tov 9eov vei.96p.eva 6e<rpovs.
ravas.carat and cahra.hak specify the upasma, beasts on the land.
Vhak- and Vcar-, sequi and colere, signify certain modes of life, e.g.
gari.sak, living on the mountains. The only old place where cahrahak
appears is Yaio,38, see under ‘Mithra’: “the cow, cahrahak, used to
following the deep pastures, is forced to go the stony way of captivity.”
The word resembles Aristoteles’ fdocrKopeva. It is no synonym of
pasuka (Wb.). ravah is primarily “open prairie,” then “liberty”; in
Y.8,8 and 52,8 ravah huva#ra “with good breathing” is opposed to anzah
14 That causes the contradictions in the interpretation of upasma < +upazma “in der Erde, in
Erdlochern befindlich,” though they are gaus. But s.v. upapa: “auf dem Lande.” Similarly “upa.apam (relating to fog) attf dem Wasser,” but “upapa (animals and ApamNapat) “im Wasser befindlich.”

duza^ra, “straits with bad breathing,” hence ravascarat “roaming in
the prairie.”
Wild beasts of prey are mentioned in a song to Tistriya, Yt.8,36 (see
under ‘Tistriya’):
arunaca garisaco sizdraca ravascarato (with chiasm:)
“the aruna and sizdra living in the mountains and prairies.”
aruna appears only at two more places, (1) in Y.34,9 (see below) con
nected with the verb syazdat to which sizdra belongs. Bartholomae
translated “wildes Raubzeug” and “zuriickweisen, repel” ; Hertel, Beitr.
71 “feuerfarbige Schadlinge, aruna selbverstandlich gleich Ved. aruna,
Var- ‘feuerfarbig, rotbraun, goldgelb,’ xrafstra von solcher Farbe, also
Lowen oder Wolfe; fur letztere spricht das Unbekanntsein des Lowen
im Awesta . . . und dass der Wolf in .RF.1,105,18 aruna heisst.” The
“being unknown” is no argument: lions existed until about 30 years
ago in Khuzistan and southern Luristan ; tigers are still found today in
Mazandaran. But +harfstra means “reptiles”—see below—and their color
is the yellowish poisonous green. In Y.34,9 aruna designates this color or
straightaway “poisonous.”
(2) In Yr.14,23 Vrthragna appears “in shape of an aruna ram, me
sahya krpa arunahya,” in 24 “in shape of a ran a he-goat, buzahya krpa
ronahya.” Unless one assumes apostrophe, usually not admitted, aru
nahya has one syllable too many; rona(hya)is hapax. Wb. says: “rona,
‘wild (nicht domestiziert)’ aus Ar. *rana” and “cf. Ai. arana ‘nicht-hei
misch.’ ” Consequently, without a priv., rana ought to be “heimisch,
domesticated.” Bailey, followed by Duchesne, proposed aruna to Vru
in ravas.carat, which is against their being garisak. In both cases the
god appears not as a domesticated, but as a free animal; hence mesa
is ovis tragelaphus, buza is ibex. The Pahl. transl. has “a.ramak, not
(living) in herds,” i.e. herds belonging to men, not “non-gregarious”
in general. This perfectly fitting translation comes from a text which
had m for vn, and a script of the Awraman type allows misreading of
m
as vn. Thus both aruna and rona are doubtful, if not corrupt. I assume
that both render the OIr. correspondent to OI. urana “lamb, young
ram,” and the word from which MP. varrak, NP. barrah descend, and
that Vrthragna appears as a one-year-old wild ram and ibex.

For sizdra in Yt.8,36 and Vid.13,2, Wb. assumes “scheu, shy.” 15 But
Yt.8,36 speaks of wild beasts that are not “shy” and do not “shrink
back,” but defend themselves or attack. “Shy” is too weak an expression
and it must be causative : they are not horrified, but cause horror. That
is also the meaning of TPahl. syzdyn in the hymn on Mani’s death,
Mir.Man.111,18,19, which Henning translates by “gewaltig?”. It must
be “So that I may no more see the enemies’ form and no more hear
their ‘horrifying’ voice, vcn syzdyyn,” and in 42,19: syzdyn z’vr’n kv’n
rzmyvzn, “the horrifying hosts, the pugnacious giants (deprive all crea
tures of light) .”
In Fz’i.13,2, the porcupine, an especially “good” animal of the “holy”
creation, natural enemy, hamestar, of the xrafstra (clearly not of wolves
or lions) is called sizdra: spanam sizdram . . . yam vahaparam. spa
“dog” in mazdayasnian conception is the opposite of an invective, and
sizdra cannot imply a moral quality, but only the “horrifying” looks
of the porcupine, cf. Germ, “hasslich” = ugly, from “hass” = hatred. In
the list of dogs in Vid.^gft., the porcupine appears under the name
sukurna; equally in Fz'J.13,16. In NP. this name is lost; the 24 graphic
variants of NP. sugur in NP. dictionaries are all taken from Pahl. glos
saries; but in Ormurl it survives, with rn > 1, according to Grierson
and Morgenstierne.
Fz^.5,29, query : “If in a house in which many live one of them dies,
how many are infected with contamination by the corpse?” Answer:
“If the others are priests 1:11, if warriors 1:10, if peasants 1:9, if spa

nazgo, hunting dogs 1 :6, spa taruno, greyhound ( ? else lacking, and

Query: “But how, if it be a fox, rupis?” and (in Bartholomae’s trans
lation:) “auf wieviel von den Geschopfen des Heiligen Geistes erstreckt
der Fuchs seinen Einfluss direkt, auf wieviele indirekt etc.?” to which
AhuraMazdah replies “like a shrivelled frog, dead for more than a
year.”
With this awful chapter a fine song to the dog contrasts in Vid. 13,44,
the contents of which are: “One may compare the dog to the priest,

the warrior, the peasant, the slave-vesa, the thief, the disu ( ? who is
active at night), the slave-girl, jahika (of course not ‘whore’) and the
child.” With each one he shares three features: with vesa and jahika,
to be xyandrakara, asneresa and zarmyafsman. hvandrakara, syn. of
draxta.hunara is “having learned a craft,” see under ‘Architecture.’ zar
myafsman, “bound to the house,” to Ved. harmya “house,” see zarmyan
gura below, asneresa means certainly not “aus der Nahe verwundend
wie der Knecht und die Hure.” asna16 would be “innate”; for -resa
some Mss. have -resa; only +asna.vesa, NP. xanazad, “born in the
house” gives a satisfying sense.
The classification of the animals is not a scientific one. I once asked
a shaikh of the Shammar, why they allowed the tent to be full of grey
hounds, though they regarded a dog as impure, and he answered:
“Why, a sluqi is a cat!”
The fox, classified as dog, is called in Vid.5,33 “rupi tizidata, with
sharp teeth,” in 13,16 “ropi ,yaono.xvato.” Previously I had surmised
this epithet to express the idea of the Arab, name of the fox, “abu
1-husain, owner of the little fortress.” That was right: one must read
yona.hut, type “root-nouns with -t-enlargement,” Duchesne §107, which
are commonly formed from u-roots and always thematically inflected,
cf. +ratu.giit, xsnut etc. In Vid.5,5 and 6,5 a “spa rozo” is enumerated
between dog and wolf; the Pahl. transl. “ropas, fox” is probably right,
since p and z can be easily taken for each other, and at any rate “Scha
kal” (Wb.) is not right. Otter and beaver are considered as dogs, but
not jackal and wolf.
The jackal appears in Vid. 13,8 in a passage, Bartholomae failed to
recognize : “Who kills a dog, goes to hell with howling
ya#a vrko vayoi tute dramne barziste razure
vayoi = vai, woe! describes the howling of the jackal, like Arab, ibn
away, wawl. Thus ya#a vrko vayoi means “like a jackal.” All the rest
are locative determinations.

cypresses and planes; finally, razura—always “forest”—here and like
wise in Yt.5,30 (races of Husravah) as “pitfall, Fallgrube”: “Wald,

len; aus der Jagersprache.” A wolf would have avoided this pitfall.
Aw. dramna is the word the MP. form of which, dramnag, Bailey
discovered in the Sam-legend, bsos vn,764ff., “wormwood, Artemisia
absinthium,” loaned in Syriac as dramnag, NP. Arab, diramna,17 de
scribed as thorny shrub with yellow flowers, zargoni, e.g. Muqaddasi
443. The country Pishin is full of it, where “Sam lies inmidst the
dramnag and over him snow has fallen,” Gr.Bdh.igS. Gr.Bdh.121 op
poses dram(n)ak e dastik “prairie absinth” to homa. Dictionaries ex
plain it: nam i giyahi’st tal^-boy i dar xurasan aspan xurand, name
of a bitter herb which in Khurasan the horses eat, Arab, sih.” Sih is
Artemisia herba alba or absinthium, also translated by “wormwood.”
dramnak e kofik, “mountain absinth” is explained by afilun, probably
+aqilun, cf. Gr. o.kv\o<s = ilex, in Arab, likewise sih, and Arab, ‘aqul,
Alhagi maurorum. Yaqut 111,346: “sih, fragrant plant, called vaxsizak
by druggists.” The Pers. dictionaries write faultily vaxsiraq, but com
ment rightly “mugwort (Artemisia), wormwood,” or again “diramna,
absinthium chorasanense or turcicum.” Thus vaxsizak seems to be
“oxianense,” cf. xolozmik “stone of Xvarizm.”
The typical thorn bush of the Mesopotamian steppes is sauk or ‘aqul,
and qaisum (also in Egypt), the medicinal Achillea santolina. al
Asma‘i, the famous naturalist, characterizes in his description of
Rusafa, in Yaqut and Bakri (442), the poor steppe round Rusafa by
“only sih and qaisum.” The thornbush typical for east Iran is a thistle
called suturxar, camel-thorn. There was neither a scientific botany nor
zoology, nothing of the spirit of Theophrast. The names change and
designate different plants, but all are thorn bushes. That is the meaning
17 Syr. darmana < Ir. darman is “pharmacum.” Hubschmann, Pers. Stud. 61; Arm. darman
“provisions, victuals, fodder,” originally “sustenance.” See my Herbarium, in Arch.Reise v, for sih and qaisum.

of slh u qaisum and in Vid. 13,8, too, one must expect two such plants.
The second, tute, nom. tuta, is NP. tuS, in Shah. 1644,147 and in al
Muwaffaq, but Arab, tuth < Syr. tvt’, cf. Low, Aram. Pflanzennamen
395; name for raspberry, bramble and similar fruitbearing bushes, but
also for the mulberry tree, Ass. musukanu > Gr. sykaminos. 18 Perhaps
one may also compare Akk. and Syr. sus, Arab, sus “liquoritium” which
covers hundreds of square miles along the Euphrates and Tigris.
Dramna, at any rate, in Vid. 14,8 means the most common thorny plant
of the steppes.
The “dog porcupine,3
’ vahapara, hystrix, is an animal holy to Span
tamanyus, Vid. 13,1: “vispam pati usaham a +huno vaxsat, from every
dawn to sunrise it goes out, killing a thousand creatures of Ahriman.”19
Vid. 13,2 comments: spanam sizdram ruvisaram (yam) vahaparam yam
martiyaka (avi) duzvacaho duzakam nama ojate, Bartholomae: “den
scheuen, spitzschnauzigen Hund, den die iibel-redenden Leute duzaka,
Igel nennen.” From his misunderstanding of duzvacaho as “maligning
talk” instead of “bad Awestic, i.e. Middle Persian speaking” resulted
duz- in duzaka as “schlimm.” The name is no compound with dus-.
duzaka > MP. zuzak > NP. zuzah. Initial z in MP. can replace z;
the second z in NP. can be assimilated to the first; in MP. z and z may
have suffered metathesis. Thus OP. duzaka stands against the Median
line: *zuzaka > zuzak > zuzah.20 In Fz’^.18,15, the expression duzvaca
is applied to the designation of the cock by either parodrs or krkatas,
in FiJ.18,15 to zarmyangura and zarmyaka.
vahapara = duzaka is not a zoologically accurate equation. An animal
of the genus canis, characterized bv a pointed muzzle would be a grey
hound, not a hedgehog which is especially easy to describe. “Pointed”
for ruvi in ruvisara is merely inferred from the Pahl. comment “ku.s

pointed head.” The translation itself is d’lmk slk. Where ruvi else
appears, in ruvi.^oSa and ruvi.vrflra—cf. ayo.^oSa, zaranya.vr^man,
zari.vari—it can only mean “d’airain, of copper” as Darmesteter trans
lated in £/Jr.n,i8o. 21 d’lmk in d’lmk slk corresponds to NP. ^ar, MP.
dlmnk “thorn,” Gr. akanthos, and slk, sarak (which gave rise to sar
pozak) corresponds to pust in the NP. name of the porcupine, (Gr.
aKavdicov ) xar.pust, quill-back. Hence sarak seems to be the Aw. dual
“sari, two hides,” i.e. skin and bones or “Haut und Haar.” 22 ruvi.sara
would be “needle-hair or -skin.”
The porcupine has the obligatory epithet tir-andaz “arrow-shooting,”
according to the belief, common to Persians and Arabs. It is Gr. oxy
beles, e.g. Empedocles: avrap eylvo is o£vj8e\eis ^atrat vcotols im
mfypiKacriv.
However obscure be the etymology of vahapara, it is certainly the
porcupine, frequent in Persia and Mesopotamia. I had a tame por
cupine, called Ramazan, because it was born in that month. We found
it, a few days old and only 5 inches long, looking like a young chicken.
It took to milk and soon became entirely domesticated and big. It was
a great collector and used to pass the day with its collections under a
couch. It was not only clean of habits, but used a certain place. After
midnight it went out and came back at sunrise, as the Videvdad says. It
collected crayfishes, “Krebse, Ttarfstra” without eating them. It carried
a little bell round its neck, lost it, found it, and added it to its collections.
When a playful Airedale terrier attacked it, the dog looked afterwards
like Saint Sebastian with ten arrows in him. Two little Sealyhams and
a big shepherd dog, spinjaruska, kept at a safe distance. Ramazan stayed
over a year. One night it did not come back, and we believed it killed.
After a full year it made a one-day’s visit, then left for good.

But, the short form of IE. *raudha [in Iran, weakly represented by Aw. roSira, name of a mountain, MP.NP. rod, ro> ] would be *rudi, not ruvi. Tedesco considered an early Sasanian inxerse spelling rvy for rdy. On the other hand, IE. *raudha is related to Sum. urudu, to which corresponds Akk. eru; therefore, a variant without dental in Iranian is possible, perhaps attested by Aw. runya (XVb.

occasionally came up the stairs and allowed itself to be photographed.
The Gr.Bdh. describes the hedgehog, zuzak, as just as holy as the por
cupine, and as natural enemy, hamestar, of the “mori danakrs, MP. mor

The Arabs believe that it eats snakes, +harfstra, like an ichneumon, at
any rate it eats vermin.

“against those is a feeling of loathing with Rtam, as much as (it is)
from us towards (= between us and) the ^rafstra.”
Bartholomae: “Vor denen weicht Asa gar sehr zuriick, soweit
als vor uns das wilde Raubzeug,” a translation containing three
offenses: the instr. rta as grammatical subject; the holy rtam
compared to the most unholy xrafstra > an d the xrafstra>
whether “wildes Raubzeug” or “poisonous vermin,” do not
shrink back. Hertel, Siegesf. 71, avoids strainedly the instr.
subject, but gives no better sense: “Vor denen weiche der Ster
bliche (mas < mrt.s?) infolge des Rtam soweit wie vor uns
die feuerfarbigen Schadlinge,” explained by “wolves.” Instead
of “zuriickweichen, shrink back from” a stronger word like
“abhor, loathe” is needed, cf. the remark on sizdra, above. In Y.
32.4 (words left without comment under ‘Yama xseta’) : “vahos
sizdyamna manaho,” followed by xtatos nasyanto, the “abhor
ring” subject ought to be Vahumano, as in the protasis of Y.
34.5 Rtam; hence: “being repugnant, loathsome to Vahumano,
because they are sinning against AhuraMazdah’s xratus.” Logic
demands for 34,5 a parallelism: “against them loathing is felt
by Rtam, as much as by us against the xrafstra,” which should
become visible by conform cases of “rtam” and “we,” and of
“they” and “xrafstra.” Since the cases do not conform, the
apodosis is not governed by the verb “syazdat” of the protasis.
But it has no verb, and only a copula can be supplied. This

would be easier if syazdat were an impersonale, like Germ,
“mir graut’s vor dir!”
The etymology of xrafstra—three times in the gathas—has not been
found. Bartholomae, Wb., calls “Zerlegung in xfap + *stra wenigstens
denkbar” and quotes M. Haug in Grdr. §§40, 177 and 204: “< *krap
0tra, Fleischesser.” Meillet, Introduction, does not mention it. Ben
veniste, in Stud.Ind. -Iran. Geiger, 1931, 2i9ff.: “il n’est guere possible
d’inscrire surement au compte de xrafstra la moindre forme moderne:
Pahl. xrafstr est un emprunt ou une transcription, munj. skrafla ‘scor

last words actually anticipate a definition, at any rate excluding “meat

The Gr.Bdh. enumerates as xrafstr: azi, mar, gazdum, klbvn (must be
klbvk), vazak, i.e. dragon, snake, scorpion, lizard, frog. In a passage

and mites and frogs,” from the picture of the Iranian “Lady World”
which passed over into the western Middle Ages along with Beelzebub,
i.e. bel dababi, “diabolos,” understood as “lord of flies” : “Herr der Rat
ten und der Mause, der Fiiegen,- Frosche, Wanzen, Lause” (Faust).24

That is the meaning of xrfstr, which therefore belongs to IE. *serp-,

pentes. Since Trap- would become Yap- in Iranian ( Grdr. §87), I read,
following Tedesco’s suggestion, "harfstra. These are Herodotus’ herpeta,

Their epithet aruna, in Y.34,9, a color, corresponds to the more fre
quent zarita, poisonous yellow, cf. Y.9,11:
yam visavantam zaritam yam upari +visam roSat
arstiya.brzat zaritam
“the poisonous, yellow one, over whom the yellow poison rose high as
the length of a lance” (cf. Bailey, bsos vii, 1935, 83). For Aw. zarigona,
“yellow, golden” the Pahl.transl. gives zart, zartgon, expl. by tarr,
sabzrang, i.e. the light yellowish green, as in aruna harfstra, the color
of poison.
A harfstra is the zarmyangura, which Vid. 13,6 describes as the op
posite to vahapara:
“,daeum‘ yam zarmyanguram nama yam martiyaka avi duzvacaho
zarmyakam nama ojate, the deva zarmyangura which badly Awestic
speaking people call zarmyaka.”
Like the vahapara it goes out at the early dawn, but kills “a thousand
creatures of Spantamanyus,” a notion including plants and grains. Pahl.
transl. transcribes zarmiangur, NP. transl. is “lakpust, tortoise.”
Whether this animal is really meant is not certain. Spiegel and Geiger
thought of the mole, talpa. Bartholomae believed it confirmed by the
etymology: zarmya, OI. harmya “solid house, case”; angura, OI. anguli
“joint, finger, toe”; and as a whole OI. harmuta = tortoise. He took, as
Arab. but. to serpentine, cf. a!-makviv.J. “the spiral," name of the great minaret of Samarra; and ‘aqabat al-mal\vi>>a, Yaq. 111,638, name of one of the great Alwand passes, “the serpentine."

does Benveniste, zarmyaka as familiar abbreviation. But the normal
word would be Aw. kasyapa, MP. kasapak, kasavak, NP. kasaf or
kasau. The Europ. languages have another word: Gr. x^Au?, xekdvrj,
Old Lat. golaia,27 Slav. zely. With the Greeks the animal had a chthonic
connotation, as shown by the etymology of “tortoise,” found by H.
Gregoire: tartaruga < Vaprapovyo?, “denizen of the Tartarus.”28 Her
tel denied “zarmiya, ein festes Haus habend” in zarmiyavant as epithet
of the moon, and it is doubtful, since the only explanation, allusion to
the “moon-stations,” is too young a notion in view of the antiquity of
that word. The Pahl.transl. is sabzawmand, NP. sabzrang, “green,”
comm, “makes the world—sar?—green,” seemingly identifying zar
miya with zari, combined with zarmaya “spring,” though the moon
does not influence the seasons. The Pahl. transl. renders Aw. garman
“throat” by MP. galuk, (NP. gulu) as if assuming a change rm > 1 .
zarmyaka may be an artificial word, with inverse rm < 1, for a spoken
‘zalyak?.
The animal is called ,daeum‘, i.e. normally “devam, god, dev,” here
rather MP. dyvg, “caterpillar, worm.”29 A worm with a house evokes
the idea of a snail, NP. xana-bar-dus, “house-on-the-back.” OIr. name
unknown. On the other hand, a name composed with “claw” evokes the
idea of crustaceans, of which Homer, Batrach.i^\, gives an unequalled
description. In the East, the crab, /cdp/avos, is the best known species;
always so in the zodiacal sign of Cancer, MP. karcang, NP. xarcang,
with popular assimilation to “cang, claw, shears.”
Crustacea is the meaning of the Germanic name of die lobster,
ONord. humarr, Germ, hummer, Gr. fcdppapo?, etymologically related
to 01 . ’kamartha (cf. OI. [Gramm.] “kmarati, to be curved,” Boisacq,

animal covered with a “test,” cf. Lat. testudo, from “testa, test, shard,”
Aw. tasta > NP. Arab. tast. For the archeological side of these words

“crust-skinned,” i.e. crustaceous, and ayicvXoxijXrjs “with curved claw.”
The striking similarity between these epithets and zarmiyangura, in
character and form, seems to me a better starting point for an ety
mology than the attempts made so far.
The objection against Morgensderne’s connection of skrafla, scorpion
with harfstra, “diverge pour le sens,” is not valid; the generic name is
applied to a species. And it looks as if more words were originally
related, to be subsumed under *serp-, *skerp- or *kerp-.



XXXI. HOMA INVICTUS
“Quo me Bacche rapis tui plenum?”
In 1931, the second year of the excavations of Persepolis, I received a
letter from a gentleman in New York. His hobby was botany, and he
said that he had reasons to believe a plant growing only in Persepolis,
Salvia Persepolitana, was the Homa. It was a little late in the season,
but from the beautiful picture of it I found just one small shrub with
one flower left, and sent it. It was the right one, and afterwards I sent
seed of this plant.
In the autumn a letter came, asking me to send some living plants
by airmail, for which I would receive in time packing materials, sea

Botanical Garden, but warning me not to miss the flowering-season and
to consider that the writer was an old man.
The mail went by Bushir on the Gulf. A letter from Persepolis to
Teheran with answer took always just a month. The sea-weed arrived
in Bushir in December. The Persian import law did not contain a para
graph on sea-weed, and—minima curat praetor—the package went to
the Direction Generate des Douanes in Teheran. In the beginning of
February I was advised to give power of attorney to somebody to
receive a parcel that had reached Teheran. I wrote to the legation to
which I was attached, asking them to take charge of it. Early in March
the answer came, they had tried in vain, I was to write directly to the
Director General of Customs. I did so and got the answer, early in
April : the parcel seemed to contain dried plants and was free of duty.
The salvia was in full bloom everywhere at Persepolis.
I wrote to the Minister of Finance, asking whether he could have
the parcel sent to me. In the beginning of May the Minister wrote back,
he would do his best. At the end of May, an under-secretary of the
Ministry of Public Instruction visited us, and was kind enough to take
with him the whole pile of documents, promising to settle the matter.
At the end of June he informed me that the Director General was
ready to deliver the package to the Imperial Bank of Persia. I wrote
to the bank. The salvia had long ceased blossoming. While I was wait
ing for an answer, in July 1932, in New York, my unknown friend
died.

The sea-weed stayed in the Direction Generale des Douanes, a small
box with seed of Salvia Persepolitana, perhaps the homa, stayed with
me, together with a withered fig-leaf from Ardashir’s “castle of the
Graal” and a dry rose from Alamut, the castle of Hasan al-Sabbah,
the Assassin, and with some ephedra from Aurel Stein who regarded
it as the true homa. Once I had brewed a tisane of salvia, and once the
seeds were sown, the plants started growing, and—if a cloud-burst had
not swept everything away, I would press homa today.
Homa is the plant, the drink, and the god, Ved. Soma. The name
of the Saka Homavrga contains the word, and the name of the mythical
hero Hosyanha, of Scythian origin. Homa is derived from y'hu-, “to
press (wine).” Not a few songs to homa are preserved having found a
shelter mainly in Yasna 9-1 1, the so-called ‘Horn yasht,’ and in Vid.
18-19. The great yashts mention Homa only occasionally,1 the gathas
never.
Though, in their present state, the language of these songs is deficient,
their general character is archaic and much may be pre-Zoroastrian,
but nothing pre-Iranian. The cultivation of the plant, the making of
the drink, and the cult of the god are at least as old as the Aryan period,
middle of the second millennium, but the songs were made and sung
in Iran. The Horn yasht, 9,4, calls Vivahvant, father of the first man
Yama (see under ‘Yama xseta’), the first homa presser, A#wiya, father
of ©retona, the second, and ©rita, the Sanaa, father of Krsaspa, the
third. All the great heroes of the pre-Iranian golden age drank homa.
But what homa was has never been defined.
It was grown on hills, in vineyards, like vine.
y.10,3:
stdmi garayo brzanto
ya#ra homa ruruSisa stomi zam pr#wim pa#anam
bar#rlm te homa rtavam
stomi zmo ya#a roSahe

I praise the high hills
where homa is grown,
I praise the earth, the wide and
broad,
that bears thee, Hdma, the just.
I praise the earth’s gardens
where thou growest full of perfume . . .

That the plant did not grow wild, but was cultivated, follows from
the term caranam, to Vkar-, kars-, NP. kistan “to plough,” cf. yava.
caranya and NP. zar, flowerbed in a garden. The same is expressed
by the perf.med. ruruSisa, cf. zam roSyam karsyam. Such plantations
are no open fields, but had the characteristic of a “garden, parideza,”
the diSa, wall of adobe or a hedge around them. Already the Ritti
Marduk kudurru of Nebuchadnezzar I, dealing with the Luristan
region where later the famous Masabadhi wine (bit Kubatti of old)
grew, says: “the (m)akkalti kirepl (cf. Arab, ‘aqala) hedges of the
gardens (vineyards) and the date-palm groves no man is to cut down.”
y.10,5:
vispe homa upastomi
yatcit barsnusva garinam
yatcit janfnusva ravanam
yatcit anzahu drtaho
+jarinam upa drzahu
I praise all the h5ma
whether on the heights of the hills
or in the valleys of the rivers,
or kept in the narrow
prisons of the wine-jars.
Though thousands of years and miles separate them, one cannot
fail to see the similarity with German wine-songs: “Nur am Rhein . . .
wo die Berge tragen Reben, und die Reben goldnen Wein!”
The text of 5e has “janinam,” and Bartholomae translated “ob sie in
Gefangenschaft gehalten sich in den Fesseln der Weiber befinden (was
ist damit gemeint ? ) .” Lommel : “die in der Enge gehalten sind in den
Biindeln der Frauen.”
What is meant becomes clear by comparing the humorous verses
Y.11,3, where Homa curses
yo mam
awishutam darayahi
ya#a tayum prta.saram
nava ahmi prta.saro
you who
store me when pressed
like a criminal who forfeited his
head,
I am not one who forfeited his
head!
After being pressed, homa wants to be drunk, he feels himself im
prisoned in his barrel like a djinn in the bottle. The barrel was a cylin
drical storage vessel of pottery, without spout or handle,2 called djarrah,
2 Also called “dinn,” cf. Ausgr. t'.Samarra , vol. m Wandmalereien , p.85, pl.4off.; vol.v Kerami\ p.u.

djaraq in Arabic, a loanword from Iranian which passed over into
European languages as It. giarra, Fr. jarre, Engl. jar. OP. *garaka, cf.
NP. piyalah, paiyalah < pat-yalak < ’pati.gara, and OP. batu.gara,
comp, with *bata > baS, fresh wine. Hence, janinam is one of the cases
of wrong n for r, read +jarlnam. And the verses 5,d-2 say: Homa is
jugged in the jug, the jar. 3
Y.10,2 describes the making of homa. It is made like wine, by “press
ing, Vhu-,” in a havanam, press. This consists of a frataram, principal,
and an uparam, upper, havanam. Bartholomae compared upara with
Gr. hyperos, pestle of a mortar, and translated “yahmi niyne nars ojaha,
womit ich hineinstampfe mit Manneskraft,” wherewith I bray, crush.
It is not really a mortar with a pestle, but a press with a press-stone, and
Lommel objected: “der obere Teil ist kein Stossel oder aufgehobener
und auf die Pressmasse niederfallender Stein, sondern er ruht auf der
selben, und es wird durch Schlage auf den Oberteil der Druck auf die
Pressmasse ausgeiibt.” That is impossible. The material was stone, the
form like a hand-mill but of considerable size, ni + gan- is a motion
vertically down. One cannot beat stones without breaking the instru
ments and finally the stone; the stone operates by its weight to which
one adds by standing on it and stamping with the feet, Vhu-. In the
description of brick-making, Fzi.2,31 says: “stamp the clay with the
heels, knead it with the hands, as still today men visavayanti (Vhu-)
stamp sundried bricks.” This is at the same time the most primitive
way of making wine, stamping the “Pressmasse” with the feet directly.
The “pulp” which the frataram havanam “contains,” hangrvayati,
is called “ansu, 01 . amsu,” a term occurring in Iranian only here and in
Nir.108: “how large shall be the ansavo?” Wb. translates “Schoss
(shoot), Zweig (twig).” The liquid is produced by simple pressing
and develops alcohol by itself, when fermenting. Not even the most
tender sprigs of any plant would contain more sap, liquid, than wood
pulp. The material can only be a fruit, a berry, with much juice—sweet
juice as the epithet “goma” expresses—and little fleshy, not wooden

Y/.5, 122 bata yafa.mgm = +bati\aka, unter 'Ardvi.’ abigara abigarta in Vispr. 22,1, Pahl.transl. apar rasisnih, also used for abijarta(r) in Vispr. 5,1, and apam vahvlnam fra.idm pati.itim abi.jartim in Y. 62,11, repeated in Y.70,6 and 71,6, may also belong to Vgar-, galaya, Skr. galati “to flow, drip,” instead of Vgar- “to praise.” batugara is the word that appeared to H. H. Schaeder so false that he “branded” the beautiful silver phiale of Artaxerxes I, Altp.Inschr. n° 23 as “a modern fake.” Against my indication in Altp.Inschr., only one of the four dishes has the inscription.

pulp, part of which dissolves itself. Therefore, “ansu” can only be
“shoot” in the sense of “vitis, Germ. Rebe,” with the same shifting of
meaning from “tendril,” vine, to “bunch of grapes.” The product,
homa, has the standing descriptive epithets “zari, zarigdna, zaridoi^ra,
golden, yellow, gold-eyed,” like the “golden wine” in German poetry
and the “yellow qahwa” of the early Arab poets.
Y.10,14 describes the effect of the alcoholic drink:
ma me ya0a gaus drafso
asito varama care
frasa frayantu te maSo
vrziyahvaho jasantu
Just as the German song: “Trinket
sind wir begeistert!”
We do not want to reel insensibly
like the steer drunk from brand
ing,
straight shall walk those drunk
with thee,
in full possession of their senses
they shall stride!
ihr, seid ihr betrunken, trinken wir,
Wolff-Bartholomae translated: “Nicht sollen sie mir beliebig
wie das Stierbanner (das Reichsbanner aus Stierfell oder mit
einem Stierbild, das im Winde schwankt) sich einher bewegen,
(wenn) sie (dich) geniessen; stracks vorwarts sollen die gehen
(die) sich an dir begeistern; mit energischem Schaffensdrang
sollen sie sich einstellen!”
Similarly Lommel: “Nicht soil mir wer davon getrunken hat,
wie das Stierbanner (Anspielung auf das iran. Reichsbanner,
das der Schmied Kava aus einem Lederschurz hergestellt hatte)
nach Belieben ( ? schwankend) sich einherbewegen. Wunder
bar mogen herbeikommen deine Rausche, wirksam mogen sie kommen!”
Skr. translation (in Unvala’s Engl, translation) : “Mayst thou
not go away quickly out of battle like the bull-banner.”
Bartholomae and Lommel, both attributing to the Awesta a higher
antiquity than the Achaemenian and Median empires, yet take no of
fense at the “Iranian imperial banner” which implies the existence of
that empire. Fortunately, drafsa, here, is not the Iranian banner, be
having like a drunkard and deserting the battle, but the “signum, NP.

dirafs, diros, punch and branding-iron,” cf. Altp.lnschr. 348s. Recently
(jras 1942), Henning found MP. drafsa(g), misspelled grafsa, in the
name of the 19th moon-station, equal to Gr. kentron, sting of the scor
pius, NP. nls i gazdum, Arab, shaula. “Receiving” the daxsta, impress
of the branding-iron, is called “asito, having drunk,” like NP. “xurda,
having eaten, suffered.” It has been said: “The Persians are omnivorous,
they eat—mixurand—everything,” cf. Amer. to swallow. After the
branding the cattle raise themselves stunned and staggering to their
feet like a drunkard.
Zoroaster does not allow the word hbma to pass his lips, only two of
his sayings allude to it. In Y.32,14—see under ‘Welcome’—he declaims
against words which he attributes to sacrificial priests, and which must
be a quotation, adapted to his meter, from a pre-Zoroastrian hymn to
Homa:
gaus jadyai yo durosam socayat avo!
“the steer must be slaughtered, that it may inflame to help him-before
whom-death-flees !”
gaus jadyai is the opposite to gaus azi agnya in Y.haft. 38,5: “the cow
must not be slaughtered,” and both sayings embody ideas of high antiq
uity, with Vedic connections. The same is valid for durosa, Ved. du
rosa, an Aryan epithet of Hdma,4 the meaning of which resembles Sum.
gestin, “tree of Life.” Bartholomae annotates that Homa gets part of
the sacrifice as inducement; according to Y.11,4 it was the hahvarna,
jaw-bone.
The second place is Y.48,10:
kada mazda ,manrois‘ naro visante
kada ajan muftram ahya madahya
ya ahraya karpano +rdpayante
yaca xratu dusxsa#ra dahyunam
“When, o Mazdah, will the warriors, from their intoxication, recover
their senses, when (at last) wilt Thou slay that urine of a wine, after
which, in their evil will, the sacrificers and the evil satraps belch ?”
In contrast to huxsatfra in st.5, the satraps are here called dusxsa^ra
because they get drunk, together with the naro, the noble xsafhfya,
4 Cf. Bailey, Transact. Phil.-Soc. 1936, 85s; and Duchesne, Comp.ar. p.272.

and the karpano of Homa who abet them; therefore their xratu> will
and knowledge, is called ahra, from ahra manyu.5
i?F.i,8o says “made” for “soma,” and likewise Zoroaster uses “mada,
mead, new wine, Germ. Most” in order to avoid the hated word homa.
Aw. mad- is “to get drunk,” masta “drunk” and “ruttish”; the highest
degree is ayryamaSimastama. In the first line, where the Mss. offer
m^narois, m^n.narois, the redactor seems to have transformed the bisyl
labic instr.-abl.pl. of a genuine *madra, ‘mandra, which offended him
in the holy gatha.
+ropayante (Mss. -ti) is spelled with p in all Mss. Wb.\ denom.pres.
of *rupa “Scheinbild,” hence “betriigen.” B. Geiger and Lommel see
in it a word for “causing stomach-ache.” It seems to me to be the same
word Homer uses of the drunk Polypheme : 6 8’ ipevyero olvoftapeiaiv,
whether the p be right or to be replaced by g: Vrup-, Lat. ructare,
Germ, riilpsen, an onomatopoetic word of the aboriginal IE.6
What was Homa? Viticulture spread from Asia Minor into Syria,
Mesopotamia and Armenia as early as the copper age, the fourth mil
lennium b.c., imported by the miners coming from the Cappadocian
Pontus: Chalybes, Tibarenoi and others. 7 Many indigenous peoples
therefore adopted the Anatolian names with the thing. Gr. ampelos,
“vine,” is such a loanword, cf. the common placenames Amlada in
Lycaonia, Ablata in Cappadocia, Amblada in Pisidia and ‘Pov
crovp.f3\a8a, with hronds-, name of a god, in Cilicia. The word is
Lyc. eple, apla, and was transferred, as Ebla, later Abina (Tell-Amarna
period), Abila (Hellen.), Abil (al-suq) (Arabic) to the Antilibanos
as early as NaramSln and Gudea. Near Ebla-Abil lies Arab. Hulwan
dhu 1-kurum, “with the vineyards,” where the most famous wine of
antiquity was grown: Ezekiel 27,8 halbon, Nebuchadnezzar (Wadi
Brisa) hilbunu, Gr. XaXvfiwviov olvov , which the kings drank in Susa,
Strabo 15,3,22.—The Babylonians said karanu, another loanword, writ
5 ahra> a and x rat^> separated by Bartholomae and Andreas, must be connected as K. E. Punegar does in his translation “through (their) carping (intelligence)” and “through (their carping) intelligence.” 6 Cf. rozo and ropi, rupi, Pahl.transl. ropas, “fox” under ‘ArdvI.* 7 With this problem I have dealt in a still unpublished Ms. on the historical geography of the Anc. Near East.

ten with the Sum. ideogr. cestin, “tree of life,” Ar. durosa; Syr. karma,
Arab, karm, kurum, and Gr. Kapoivo<s. s
To Iran, viticulture was likewise brought by Anatolian prospectors.
The Chalybes, in whose original home on the Pontus mod. Unye still
bears the old name Oivorj, and who had settled in Aleppo = Chalybon
and Hulwan dhu 1-kurum = Chalybon, settled also at the ‘aqabat Hul
wan, the Paitaq Pass, the gate of Iran. Alwan, Halwan is mentioned
since the Sargonic period, modern Sarpul, where viticulture is attested
since antiquity, and where many antique stone wine-presses are lying
between the town and the rock with the sculptures of Annubanini.
The Tibarenoi, Tabal, their neighbors on the Pontus, between the
coast and Diwrigi-Tephrike, who settled in the fourth millennium in
Sumer, in Bad-Tibira, ideogr. bad.urud.nagar, “settlement of the Cop
per-smiths” and who are later known in the richest mining region of
the Taurus, went also to Iran, where Salmanassar mentions them, in
838 b.c., the very years of the appearance of the Aryans there, in the
Kurdish region south of the Urmiya Lake towards Sunqur and Kinga
war, near Kirmanshahan. Tabaristan on the Caspian Sea still bears
their name.
Other Cappadocians, from the Pontus, i.e. people from Hitt. Kiz
watna, settled at the south end of the “Antimon mountain” between
Zanjan and Kazwin, in Kitpat, a town which bore that name, > ka 0
wat, qahvaS till about a.d. 1300, mod. Sa’Inqaleh. All these are mining
and wine-districts. On a bronze “letter of franchise,” granted by a
“king of Abdadana” to an Assyrian tamqaru, “merchant,” to be dated
ca. 1200 b.c., GESTiN-karanu, “wine” is mentioned; Abdadana was sit
uated near west of Kitpat -QahvaS. This documents the famous wine
of the Kazwin region.
Sardur of Urartu says “I planted vine in my ki.cu,” garden, in Van,
Rusas-town, and Sargon, having conquered Ulhi, north of Tawrlz,
records: “Rusas of Urartu, by a large canal, had his fruit-trees and
vines watered as though by rain,” and after opening the “hidden wine

cellars, bit karanesu, the vast hosts of Assur drew the perfumed wine
(homa huboSis) in skins like canal-water.” Viticulture flourished every
where in Iran before the immigration of the Aryans, and nothing
prevents the assumption that it had reached the—later—famous wine
regions of Marw, Herat, Balkh and Samarkand at the middle of the
second millennium.
The problem of homa therefore is : On the one hand, vine, cultivated
all over Iran before the advent of the Aryans and after, does not appear
in the Awesta, but is a common product of the country to the present
day. On the other hand, homa, common in the Awesta, is an unknown
plant and drink, described like wine, whose cultivation has left no
trace in the country. To define homa means to explain how wine could
remain unknown to the Awesta, and how the cultivation of homa could
disappear in Iran long before the Arab conquest. The solution is evi
dent: homa is vine, wine.
“Wine” is a word of Anatolian origin.9 There are many local names
formed with it, beside OwoTj-Unye of the Chalybes, e.g. an OlvoavSa
in Lycia, on the Xanthos-siyanta river, north of Tlos, in Lyc. inscrip
tions wn.nu.wa.ta, Hitt, viyanawanta. Compared with the many Ira
nian names in -vant, Gr. -/rets, -fea-cra the first element is viyana, the
Hitt, word for “wine,” which began with vi-, for, the Sum. ideogr.
gestin has in Hitt, the phon. value vi-, acrostic of the full word. It passed
into Greek as folvos, Lat. *voinum, vinum. Alb. vene, Armen, gini,
also Hebr. yayin. But the Aryan languages did not borrow the name
with the thing, but created a name of their own for it, derived from
Yhu-, “to press (wine),” from the method of making it: homa. The
god Homa is the Aryan Dionysos. The Greeks ascribed to him a trium
phal march to India, and Alexander’s armies believed to see proof for
this legend in the flourishing viticulture in Eastern Iran as far as India.
What they observed was cultivation and cult of Homa.
The cult of Homa would have played a decisive role in the life of
Zoroaster, in Nyberg’s presentation, 286: “Zoroaster eifert immer gegen
die nachtlichen Orgien des Haoma Kultes, Gegenstand seines bren
nendsten Hasses und flammensten Pathos.” 287: “Der Haoma-Kult

hat seine Heiligkeit wiedergewonnen. Ich glaube nicht, dass die Ge

. . . nach seinem Abscheiden einen Kult aufgenommen hatte, der sich
nicht zuriickdrangen liess [sic]. Es ist undenkbar [unthinkable, as the
insolvable dilemma just quoted actually is] dass man gewagt haben
sollte, vorsatzlich eine Aenderung des Kultes vorzunehmen. ... So
bleibt nichts andres ubrig, als die Voraussetzung, dass Zarathustra sel
ber, als ein Glied des Synkretismus, der die Grundlage seiner Missions
praxis bildete, auch den Haoma aufgenommen hat,” murrain ahya
madahya. 288: “Die auflosende Wirkung hat Zarathustra nicht ver
meiden konnen, als er selber den Haoma Kult in seine Gemeinde ein
fiihrte. . . . Der maga hat dadurch den Todesstoss erhalten,” 201: “der
Herzpunkt der Religion der Gatha Gemeinde.”
This is totally incompatible with another theory, developed p.247,
that Zoroaster himself arranged a collection of his songs for the litur
gical use of his parish, adding a preface to it, both of course unwritten.
What we have would be this second, oral edition, in which Homa is
called “this urine of a wine.” 268: “Zarathustra hatte als Religionsstifter
einen offenen Blick fur die Grundwerte der Mithra-Religion [the god
to whom he dealt the “crushing blow nana!” see under ‘Mithra’] und
ihm hat er vor allem im Haoma-Kult eine Statte gegeben,” in the mu 0ra
ahya madahya.
P.268: “Zarathustra hatte damit sicher recht [he merely does not say
so] dass der Haoma Rausch [of the Mithra community] unvereinbar
sei mit dem heiligen Rausch des maga [of the Gatha community],
der vielleicht von dem weit tiefer wirkenden Hanfrausch unterstutzt
war,” whereas the Achaemenids “den Flug der Seele ... in einem
ehrlichen Weinrausch suchten.” Actually, the homa intoxication of the
Mithra community and the wine intoxication of the Achaemenids were
the same, both “propter nimium est est,” and the Mithra people de
served the same extenuating circumstances “honest.” He reproaches
them, 196: “Wer sich bei Nacht mit haoma berauschte, konnte un
moglich am Tage danach [the day after] arbeitsfahig sein,” but fails
to say at what time the Gatha people were capable of working whose
“cult of the day-god was connected with trance and hypnotic narcotisa
tion.” As to the prophet: maga means “wedding”; “hemp” is a mere
assumption. Calling hashish smoking “holy intoxication,” does not

influence the hangover effect. “Burningest hatred and flamingest pa
thos” are foreign to hashish smokers; a friend of mine, past fifty, whom
I asked, said : “I feel no effect on my health, but it makes you take life
less passionately and more philosophically.”
In a disconnected sentence in Vid. 19,20 Zoroaster asks AhuraMazdah:
“O Omniscient, sleepless art Thou, without bang, abanha!” As a ques
tion this must mean “how is it that . . . ,” and “not even bang, which
you don’t take, would make you sleep.” Certainly, to take bang was
not considered a virtue. In Vid. 19,41, the demon Kunda is called banha
vibanha, Pahl.transl. mast yut mast, drunk without drinking, banha >
NP. bang, Arab, bandj, is hashish, canapis. As vegetable fiber, hemp
replaced wdth Iranians and Scythians the linen used in the western
world, and according to Herodotus iv',73-74, the Scythians used to
strew hemp-seed on hot stones when taking a steam-bath, the vapors
having a narcotizing effect. Otherwise, the name of the plant appears
only once more, in Vid. 15,14, as abortive, presumably used internally.
Nothing is known of the use of hemp as a narcotic prior to the Arsacid
period.
The two places in the Videvdad, both dating from the beginning of
our era, show that at that time taking hashish was considered as shame
ful, “unehrlich.” Only at the end of the Sasanian period, in the Arta
viraz book, composed at that time and attributed to the beginning of
that period, bang is used to send the saint in his dream on the journey
through heaven and hell. But even he makes his will before taking
the drug. Customs change, mostly for the worse. The venerable Mus
taufi al-mamalik, who had inherited the Ministry of Finances at the
age of fifteen and had been Prime Minister more than once, told me,
when the Opium Commission of the League of Nations visited Persia:
“In the house of my father there were about a thousand servants, one
of whom perhaps did smoke opium ; if I had still a thousand servants,

he had given away almost all his great wealth,—there might be one
among them that did not smoke.”
The use of hashish in Zoroaster’s time is an imagination. The mys
terious homa is wine, a reality. Y. 19,16 advises:
homa . . . pleno titulo . . . yaf?a hvarante vahisto!
“Wine drinking is the best!”

And the old chevalier Chardin found, on the wall in an inn at Isfahan,
the verse, a “ri^ta" to which life amounts: “Life is intoxication con
tinual, the pleasure is passing, the hangover lasting.”
Herodotus iv,23 reports, from tales of Scythians and far-traveled
Greeks in the Pontic emporia, that, at the far confines of the Scythian
plains at the ascent of high mountains, there lived a people of “bald
heads,” hairless by nature, pug-nosed and with square jaw, cnpol Kal
yevea exovres peyaXa, with a language of their own, but Scythian
dress. Everyone dwells under a tree and hangs a white felt cover over
it, as shelter in winter, but not in summer. They live on the fruits of
that tree which is not higher than a fig-tree and is called ttovtlkov.
It has a fruit like a bean, Kvap-o s, but with an inner kernel, irvprjv.
When the fruit is ripe, they strain it through a cloth ; they lick or drink,
mixed with milk, the black juice, called acrxv, which trickles through,
and make also rraXadai, lozenges, of the thick residue and eat them.
Nobody does a thing to these people; they are regarded as holy, bear
no arms, decide the disputes their neighbors bring before them. The
asylum they give to fugitives is never violated. Their name is
’ApyipTraloi .
10
Argimpaioi cannot be interpreted as “bald-headed”; rather could
Ctesias’ Kakvo-rpLoi < ’karva.sar.iya, have this meaning, a name he
translates by “dog-heads” (thinking of Aram, kalba?). Argimpaioi is
the same name as Arimaspoi in the Issedonian story of Aristeas, which
Herodotus translates by “one-eyed.” Both are adjectives derived from
the name of the Scythian Ardvlsura Argimpasa, cf. under ‘ArdvT and
the etymology of Pasargadai under ‘Mada-Parsa.’
Ctesias mentions the Kapva ra ttovtlkix, Ind. frgmt. 19, see under
‘Harvatat,’ where he speaks of the siptachora-tree : “The tree is said to
bear fruits in clusters, like the vine, and yet have berries like the pon
tika nuts.” Kapva are nuts in general, according to Athenaeus n,53,b
“hard-shelled nuts, also almonds in Attic.” In n,57,c he says about the
kernels of pine-cones: “Hippocrates, in his book on tisanes, TTruravr),
calls them kokkoAovs (kernels), but most say 'irvpijva's, as Herodotus
10 Var.l. op~j ifiiraiot, apXunraioi. Herodotus’ attitude towards the linguistic problem is: argimpaioi in Sc>thian tales, arimaspoi in Issedonian tales, retold by Scythians; but both names are Scythian.

of the pontika.” Theophrast uses “karya” for cherry-stones. That it was
the fruit of the siptachora-tree that resembled the pontika nuts is hard
to believe, because manna is no fruit, but the resin of various trees;
sirexist,
11 known in Europe under the name “Turkish Delight,” is
called after its shape, palathe of Herodotus, and since Ctesias, as
physician, was interested in these products, he probably called the form
of the products, not the fruits similar.
111
Athenaeus n,53,b quotes Nicandrus of Colophon—of whose didactic
poems just the O^pLaKa and aXeZufidppaKa, pharmaceutical works, full
of rare and unknown vocables, are preserved—as saying, some called
the pontic nuts \6mp,a, while the dictionaries of Hermionax and
Timarchides gave Aios fiaKavov, “Zeus’ acorn” as second name. The
Deipnosophists evidently did not know the fruit itself, but only its
name from Alexandrinian books, and the thing belonged to the sphere
of pharmaceutics. Besides Ctesias and Nicandrus, only Galenus, also a
physician, speaks of it, ed. Kuhn, vi,335: “a boil, sometimes as large as
a pontikon nut, sometimes twice or thrice that size.” This description
is far from implying that the measure was generally known. In Arab
pharmacology the word is used as weight.
Herodotus and Ctesias use the name for something not known to
the Greeks; hence, it cannot mean “Pontic” relevant to the Pontus,
Black Sea. Neither is Tomaschek’s etymology right: “Scyth. *pan 0ika,
‘belonging to the road,’ because carried as ‘viaticum.’ ” Herodotus does
not say so, but gives it as the name of the tree; and Ctesias never uses
Scythian, but only Old Persian names. But, like the Kapva irepcriKa,
o-tvcomKa, or like “malus punica, sinica” the fruit was surely called
after the country where it grew.

Pers. mumiyai, cf. Hamdallah, nuzhat 217 “found near al-Mausil,” and Curzon, Persia and the Pers. Question 11,521. But Strabo says, xvi, i ,24: “Gordyene bears the aromatic to a/iwfxop and the yayylnv stone which drives reptiles away,” and Theophrast and Dioscurides, too, call “Armenia and Media” (Gordyene) the home of the dmomon herb; similarly the Armen, commentary to Jeremiah and Exod. 30,23: “from Tmorik4 ,” a canton of Kordik4 -Gordyene. The herb is “sweet cinnamon” and the tree does not grow in a latitude more northern than South Arabia. All these authors, even the great botanists, mistake the plant for the mineral, because the only thing they knew was the preparation.

As something well known, the pontikon appears only in two papyri
from the Fayyum. In Pap.Zenon, Cairo n.59 702 (Grenfell-Hunt) I.22,
a half choinos of pontika costs 2 oboli; in Pap.Flinders Petrie, vol.m,
n.1422, I.13, one choinos costs one drachm. Both papyri are private ac
counts, in both Kapva appear as a separate item. In the Fayyum the
pontikon was known and cheap.
Low, Aram.Pflanzennamen, quotes Syr. puntaqa from Elias of Nisi
bis (ed. de Lagarde). As pharmaceutic term this Syriac word may be
a loanword from Greek. S. Fraenkel, Aram. Fremdw., derived Arab,
bunduq, by this puntaqa, from Gr. pontika. But NP. and Arab, bunduq,
funduq is, in distinction from the Greek, a familiar word for small nuts,
acorns, beans, and besides for pills. The dictionaries, like Lisan, explain
it as “fruit of a tree, round as a (small) nut, with an inner kernel,
similar to that of the pistachio” (Arab, fustuq < Ir. "pistaka, NP. pis
tah). Therefore we translate bunduq by “hazel-nut.” The wide applica
tion shows that it had become a generic word. In the majatih, ed. van
Vloten 179, in the list of pharmaceutic weights, “al-bunduq= 1 dirham,”
is entirely an abstract word. Such names of weights are either of Greek
provenance, or words like nut, bean, pea, grain. Arab, bunduq, funduq,
which passed back into mod. Persian, retains the MP. form *pundaq <
OP. ‘puntaka. The dialectic development would be "pundah in the
north, ’punnah in the south. 12
In Ctesias’ mouth, pontikon renders OP. 'puntaka, without relation
to Gr. pontos. Likewise in Herodotus, who may have thought it to be
a Scythian word. But ’puntaka or ’puntika is a normal OP. adjective of
origin and means “from Punt, Puntic, Puntian.” It is by no means a
coincidence that the classical pharmacology knew the word from Egyp
tian sources, and that the thing itself appears only in the Fayyum
papyri. If Herodotus’ description gives the impression that middle
12 The change nd>nn in Fars: Gannawah < *gand.ab.ag, near Bushire. bunduq is to be
separated from (2) Arab, funduq <Gr. 7ravdox^ov, (3) bunduq, bunduqi, also qaus al-bunduq, “crossbow, arcubahsta,*’ and its missile. This name was hitherto assumed to ha\e passed from the missile, resembling a bunduqa, hazel-nut, to the weapon, and later from the crossbow to fire- weapons and bullets. That is wrong, as an anecdote in Hammer-Purgstalf shows: In a.d. 906/1500, the Venetians imported the first fire-weapons to Cairo. The sultan GhdrI and his amirs despised a weapon that could be handled without personal danger. Only when the Venetians hinted that the Egyptians might succumb to just this despised weapon in their fight against the Turks, they took it. bunduqi, hence, is “Venetian,” not only the fire-weapon, but the older crossbow. The date is earlier than that of the anecdote, for in the military Museum of St. Irene in Stambul there is a cannon with inscription of Qaitbay.

Asiatic mountains far to the east of the Scythian plains were the home,
the story must have shifted the locality, and though Herodotus’ words
do not sound so, Aristeas’ Arimaspeia must be the source. Argimpaioi
is but a variant of Aristeas’ Arimaspoi. “One-eyed” and other fabulous
creatures were imagined by Homer and Hesiod as living in Ethiopia.
Aristeas’ poem can be the indirect source of the stories Herodotus
heard from the Scythians. The story fits perfectly into that sociological
utopia which the miracle-man adorned with tales heard anywhere.
He was known on the Proconnesus and in Metapont, and some reality
is behind his wide journeys. If they led him to the Scythians and on the
other side as far as Lower Italy, he was surely also in Egypt, where he
may have heard the story of the pontikon. One point in Herodotus’
version itself contradicts altogether the conception that Central Asia
was the home: life under trees, in winter only covered by a felt, is a
picture utterly impossible for that region. It presumes a climate where
even at great altitude winter and summer differ only in rainfall. If on
the slope of such mountains a tree is described as growing not higher
than a fig, with a fruit in shape of a bean with hard shell and kernel,
Arab, qishr and bunn, which, when filtered, gives a black, oily juice
that gets dry, then this is word for word a description of the coffee, as
it grows between 3000 ft. and 4000 ft. altitude on the slopes of the South
Arabian and Abyssinian mountains. That country, on both sides of the
Bab al-mandab is the land Punt, Put of the OP. inscriptions, see under
‘Sea.’
The pontikon tree is the coffee tree. The Arab, name for the tree
and the bean, bunn, is assumed to be derived from Abyss, bun, the
provenance and etymology of which is unknown. But bunn is the
Arabic pronunciation of South Persian *punn < MP. ‘pund OP. punt,
the pontikon of Herodotus.
Since the name of the Argimpaioi and their word puntikam belong
to an Iranian dialect, the enigmatical acryv ought to be likewise an
Iranian word. It seems to be OI. amsu, Ir. ansu in Y.10,2, written ^su,
perhaps pronounced with gutt. 13, which designates the “pulp” of homa
in the havanam.
Arab, qahwah was originally a word of poetry for a white wine, thus
in many poems and anecdotes of the hjtab al-Aghani, the scene of which

is Samarra in the ninth century a.d. The word was applied to coffee
as late as about a.d. 1400 when Sufis in South Arabia started to drink
plenty of coffee before their ecstatic exercises. Before each draught they
shouted “ya qawi!, o Strong one!”, one of the 999 epithets of Allah,
chosen because the numerical value of its letters is the same as that of
qahwah, 116. Thus the mystic contents of the word were the reason
why it was used for coffee; it is not derived from the Kaffa-region in
Abyssinia. The introduction and propagation in South Arabia is as
cribed to several Sufis, the oldest of which is ‘Ali b. ‘Umar al-Shadhili,
821/ 1418, and it is reported that before that time only the bean, bunn,
not the shell, qishr, was used for preparing coffee. What happened
about 1400, then, was not the discovery that coffee could be consumed,
but the finding of the modern method of brewing coffee. In Abyssinia,
one still eats powdered coffee mixed with milk; in Arabia one still
eats the beans, in Persia dry powder; like the preparation described by
Herodotus, those are prehistoric methods. Coffee itself was known.
Richard Starr informed me that among the remains of grains, discov
ered in the “Hurrian stratum” of Nuzi, i.e. about 1400 b.c., the scientific
analysis stated one coffee bean.
Now, as in an old mystery play, “adventavit asinus, pulcher et fortis
simus”:
Names of wines, like qahwah, are names of origin; already the
Arthasastra says: “Its origin is its name,” and thus it was not only in
India, but everywhere, qahwah is not Arabic, and can, as to its form,
be derived from an Iranian ‘kahvah < *ka#waka. This word occurs in
the tariff of a surgeon in Fi^.7,42: The surgeon can charge for an opera
tion on the chief of a house, nmanapatis, one head of big cattle of
inferior quality, on a vispatis the same of middle quality, on a zantu
patis the same of best quality, and on a dahyupatis a chariot harnessed
with four horses. For an operation on their wives he may charge,
in the first case, a she-ass, kjzdtt/a, in the second a cow, in the third a
mare, in the fourth a she-camel. The tariff is now in the Videvdad, in
which it can hardly be put before the beginning of our era, but the
social structure was no longer in existence, payments in kind were re
placed by money, one no longer drove in a chariot; altogether, the tariff
itself is much older, from the sixth-fifth century b.c.
The meaning “she-ass” of kafHva is required by the context and cor

roborated by the Pahl. transl. hmr’ (ideogr.) and NP. xar < OP. xara 5
this is the normal word, while ka#wa must be a special donkey, not a
mule, astar < Med. ‘aspatara, OP. *asatara, compar. of aspa “horse.’3
Like wines, domestic animals are called after the region where the
special breed was bred; it is enough to recall, for Iran, the Nesaean
horses from Nisaya, or “mesaia” from Mesa, arsibini from Rzifya. One
has Herefords and Brahmas in America, Shropshires in Europe. A
region in Kirman, not far from the straits of Hormuz, bears the name
KavOcovLKTj on Ptolemy’s map, i.e. OP. *ka0wanika. The source of all
his very accurate knowledge of South Iran is Eratosthenes, and through
him the general staff of Alexander. As Kahvan, Kahun, that name was
alive in the middle ages. 13 The place was two days from Siragan on the
road to Rustaq i Rustaq (mod. Rustak), these two between Furg
(OP. Parga) and Tarun (OP. Tarava). The name means “donkey
country.” 14 Today the region of course has donkeys, but no special ones.
But opposite, on the Arabian side of the straits, in Bahrain, is the home
of the famous white Bahrain donkeys, with their enormous ears, and
Yaqut iv,209, quotes from abu Hanlfa’s kjt. al-nabdt, book on botany, the
mountain qahivan there, which stretches along the coast of ‘Uman, out
side the straits. Thus the Bahrain donkeys seem to be the issue of the
antique kaf?wa.
Now, also in Greek, k<xv9o)v, fem. Kav9i<s, and Kav9rj\io>? mean “don
key”; there, too, it is not the usual but a special word, not common.
In a scholion to Aristophanes’ Vespes 179, a ko.v9o)v, is called “big”;
a Libyan ko.v9u>v is described like a zebra. Xenophon, Cyrop. 7,5,11
uses ovoi Kav9rjXioL, “donkeys with packsaddles,” for such animals in
the army. Word and thing are the same, but their phonetics forbid
common linguistic descent. Both are loanwords, both names of origin,
and the land of origin must have been between Iran and Greece, in
Anatolia.
Asia Minor has always been famous for its horses, donkeys and
mules. Still before the time of Hammurapi, in the 19th century b.c., the
Assyrians had organized the import of horses from the Halys region
to Assur, for military purposes. The Iliad says 11,852:
feveTojv odev rjpuovcov yevo<s ayporepdcov. These Veneti lived in

Paphlagonia, Strabo 5,1,4. On the other hand, 11. xxr/,279 : “they har
nessed the mules, the strong-hoofed, that pull in the traces, which once
the Mysians had sent Priamus as a magnificent present.” Anacreon,
frgm. 25 Bergk, calls the Mysians “inventors” of mule breeding: ltttto
dopov Se Mwrot evpelv pu^iv ovcov irpos ittttovs. Lat. mulus < mus.los,
through Thracian and Illyrian, means “the Mysian ass.” 10 Strabo 12,
C.539, calls Bagadaonia, situated towards Armenia, especially ovaypo
/36to<;. Breeding of mules is not merely a human “invention”: I once
had bought, in 1912, at ‘Anah on the Euphrates, a beautiful mule, the
father of which was an onager, wild ass ; it had the reddish color of a
deer. Pliny, in his chapter on mules, nh. V11144, distinguishes between
hinnies: “equo et asina genitos mares hinnulos antiqui vocabant,” and
mules: “contraque mulos quos asini et equae generarent,” and quotes
the amazing belief “Theophrastus vulgo parere in Cappadocia tradit,”
whereas in other regions they did not propagate.
From the article “Esel” in Pauly R£. I learn that Brunnhofer, already
in 1900, had explained Katpatuka-Cappadocia as Iran. ka#wa plus
Skr. toka [the word is attested in Iran, by the gloss tvk<x]. Katpatuka
is no Iranian name, but that of a region adjoining Armenia which
the Medes applied to their new satrapy of Central Asia Minor in
585 b.c., after the Alyattes treaty, -tp- is no Iranian sound and represents
what had become of Hittite -zv- in Kizvatna (last mention about
1200 b.c.) at that time, in the mouth of Armenians. The Persians re
tained the Median spelling; the Greeks transformed it to Kair-n-aSo/ce?.
The stem was kitpat-, a name known to the Assyrians in the 8th cen
tury as that of a town in Media, Kitpat(tia), which survived down to
a.d. 1400 as QahvaS, between Zandjan and Kazwin. kahvaS < *ka#wat
proves that -tp- in Katpatuka was pronounced like -0w-. The region
is rich in minerals and viniculture, and the name preserves that of set
tlers from Kizvatna, Cappadocia Pontica. There was something right
in Brunnhofer’s wrong etymology: the kaflwa-donkey is the “Cappa

Schrader, as also Ernout-Meillet, Diction., last edition. <.v., reject the assumption, equally improbable for zoological reasons, implied in Bartholomae's connecting of mulus with Aw. muza in the n.pr. saimuzi of Yt. 13, and with uryAos in Hesychios: ‘'Phoctan. ass for breeding.” In Saimuzi the archet. can only have shown s for z, and mvsy may mean “Mysian” like mulus, if it means such an animal at all.

“Cappadocia, Kizvatna.”



XXXII. APAM NAPAT

In countries poor in rainfall, like Iran and Eranvez, the original
home of the Aryans, all agriculture depends on irrigation. This experi
ence of the Aryans before their separation has left a mark in a special
feature of their picture of the world: an outer dike, OI. setu, Ir. hetu
around the ocean Yurukrtam which encircled the round earth like a
broad stream, a notion of people that had banked the two big rivers
of their country, Vahvi and Ranha, for irrigation. The surname of the
Sarasvati-harahvatx, “hetumant, with many dikes,” at Alexander’s
time ‘Hxvju.ai'Spo?, still today Hilmand—comes down from the Aryan
period.
In Yt. 13,9 the Fravarti support the earth “on which the waters flow in
canals, 0rdtastaco apo tacinti naviya,” and in the Mithra yasht, 10,14,
arya.sayanam is the country “where the waters of broad canals work
foaming, yahmiya apo naviya prowls ysoSaha #waxsante,” a way of
describing natural to people that lived in artificially irrigated lands.
Ardvl has the epithet “aSuiraSana, increasing the canals” in Yt.5,1,
and the first month of the Persian calendar, originally 21.m-20.1v, was
called “adukanis, canal-digging.”
Vid.3,4: “Where on earth is it best? Where one cultivates most,
by watering unwatered land, yat an.apam ai1 apam krnoti.” In 213
Sel. = 98 b.c., a bronze statue was put up for Zamaspes, stratiarch of
Susa, and its inscription says :

The contrast of apa and anapa is the dominating feature of the whole
country. An.apa “without water,” becomes the general word for

tama, entirely void of water and vegetation”; NP. “biyaban, desert, <
Aw. viyapa, without water.” “Corn-land,” Ved. and Ir. urvara, stretches
as far as one can conduct, fra.bar-, water.
One word for irrigation is Vhrz-, cf. vishrzana under ‘Videvdad,
Hareva.’ The spade used for digging the small ditches is called kastram,
kanstram, enumerated in Vid. 14,11 among the tools of a vastrya-fsuyant,
farmer, with the descriptive adj. patisharzanam varzayantam, Pahl.
“kas [ke] pads kanend, bel, spade for digging.” bil is still the usual
word, also in ‘Iraq; patishrza < Ar. ‘pati.srg’ha.
Another word is Vhic-, hinc-, “to draw” water, cf. Hiibschmann,
PersStud. 10, not “to pour” (if7A 1727: giessen); one does not “pour,”
but “lift and conduct” irrigation water. In all Semitic languages, too,
the term is dl’, to draw, with a “Akk. dalu, Arab, dalw, bucket.”
Vid.5,5: “na tat apam hincad avi yava.caranyam, suppose a man would
draw water on a barley-field. . . .” The same idiom had been used
in the Akk. legend of Sargon of Akkad who was raised as apprentice
of the “naq me, water-drawer,” Aqqi—a name which itself means “I
drew water” and is formed like Old Semitic divine names, a fact that,
alone, shifts the origin of the institution far back into prehistory. The
name Moses must have the same meaning, not as Gen.2,10 says: “She
called his name mosah and spoke: for I have drawn him out of the
water,” for the participle is active, the “drawer,” not the “drawn.” In
history, NaramSln (Ur n° 275) makes the captive king of Aleppo
work at a water-wheel (with buckets), Akk. dali narabti, Arab,
daliya.
naviya is still generally translated “navigable” by scholars who
imagine the “Awesta-people” living without knowledge of agriculture
as “nomads of the steppes” around Marw and Khvarizm. In Arabia,
with similar conditions, the bedouins only “navigate” the “ship of the
desert.” Navigability is no quality of water, but of rivers, and naviya
is never used of rivers, but only of water, naviya, a qualificative adj.
like xaniya “water in springs,” catiya “in wells,” parsuviya “in canals,”
variya “in ponds, lakes,” means “water in nav,” and OIr. nav, like NP.
nav, is “every long hollow tube, pipe, water-canal, especially ‘canalis
per quam aqua molam agens fluit,’ the mill-ditch.” The word is the
same as Gr. vavs, Lat. navis, because the primeval form of a boat was

F/^.14,16: The penalty for injuring an otter is “to turn, roll (fra.
rvisyat) seven beams (prtavo, not ‘bridge’)” and another penalty in
18,74 “to stretch, spread (frascimbanoit) thirty frascimbana, beams,
over apo naviya, irrigation ditches.” A river spanned by a beam would
not be “navigable.” fraskamb, Arab, djassara, is “to bridge” water by
a djisr, Akk. gasuru, frascimbana, “beam,” the usual bridge of Iranian
and Irakian ditches, whence the proverb “yikhaf ki.man yaruh ‘ala
1-djisr, he is afraid like one going over a bridge,” not that the bridge
might break, but that he might slip off. In Vid. 13,37, a d°g falls “in a
hole, a well, a cleft, the bed of a flowing river,” ruSi = OP. rota, and at
the last in apo naviya, not a “navigable river” where he would swim
to the next boat, but the canis falls in a canalis, or worse, in the deep
shaft of a qanat. In Y/.io,i4, no navigable “rivers flow foaming [up
stream:] against the Hindukus,” quite apart from the fact, often ad
duced as counterargument against Nearch’s and Onesikritus’ remarks
on rivers in Persis, that there are no navigable rivers in Iran. In the
repeated formula “with the power of a camel, a stallion, a donkey
[read '‘xaranam f°r garlnam, mountains] and apo naviya,” this is “mill
trenches,” for water-power is not measured by the number of ships it
carries, but of the mills it turns, afs naviya means “irrigation ditch”
everywhere in the Awesta.
The same at the only place, Beh. §18, where it appears in OP.: “The
army of NidintuBel held the Tigris, there they had taken up position,
uta abis naviya aha; Then I ordered my army to lie on goat skins. . . .”
During the excavations of Assur, a great number of workmen, living
on the eastern bank of the Tigris, did so twice a day, the usual thing
where there are no ferries, and the only thing for an army without a
fleet. The Akk. text is at variance: “They held the ‘aba’ [probably
‘abba,’ to abubu, inundation, cf. Arab, ‘ubab], the Tigris was at high
water, idDiqlat mali.” Assyrian annals mention occasionally the crossing
of rivers at highwater, e.g. Salmanassar, Obel.27,34; “purat ina mllisu
ebir, I crossed the Euphrates at highwater,” emphasizing the perform
ance. Of the El. version two ideograms only remain: “MIia [-].h
GisMAld.na,” the second a gen. “of a boat.” abis, abis, aDbis in OP. is a

plastic stems of Ir. ap-, afs, awz with OI. ambhas, citing NP. abis-xvard
as example for “suffix-ablaut.” R. G. Kent, in jaos 62,4, 1942, 269^.,
explains OP. abis < *ap.bhis, instr.pl., takes naviya as a fem.noun,
“navigability,” and arrives at “and on account of the waters there was
navigability”; since it goes on “I ordered the army to lie on goat
skins,” the thread of thought would be: “unfortunately, having no
boats, I ordered.” Moreover, the Tigris is navigable the whole year
through, even at low water, up to a point much farther upstream,
almost to south of Samarra; at full highwater the ferries usually stop
working. An instr.pl. abis could be construed as another example for
Andreas’ theory, nggw 1931, 111,316: OP. raucabis and vi#bis, instr.
in form, nom.-acc.pl. in signification [wrong for vifffiis, a dative] “in
der gleichzeitigen Volkssprache waren alle Pluralkasusendungen gesch
wunden bis auf dies -bis.” But in view of NP. abisxvard one can regard
abis or anbis as nominative corresponding to Aw. afs in the metapl.
system, at all events, OP. abis naviya is Aw. afs naviya, and the clause
says “and there was a canal, or were canals,” Akk. version “high
water,” a further obstacle.
apo naviya is translated in Vid. 14,16 and 18,74 by n’vt’k or n’yvt’k,
which the Frhg.Pahl. explains by a NP. gloss: “navdanah, ‘ubur i abgah
ki dar an [ab] mirizad, pipe-system, passages of a basin through which
[water] flows”; apparently a compound with -tak, to Vtak- “to flow,”
hence “pipe-conduit,” cf. 0rotas.tak “running in rivers” under ‘Tistriya.’

reca and *ca0rica, with the same ending as dihliz < *dvar#ica, from
‘katfra, *ca#ra, to V'kan- “to dig,” cat- “well.”4 These systems of qanat
or karlz, visible at the surface by the row of their vertical shafts, serve
for opening up as well as conducting water, and have been developed
in Iran since the bronze age; they are first mentioned in history at the
campaign of Antiochus II in Komisene, 209 b.c. In the Sasanian period,
e.g. Tabari 1,873: “during the seven years of drought under Peroz, the
rivers, qina, and springs dried up.” In Samarra there may be nearly a
hundred miles of them.
Irrigation with dams and dikes on rivers, surface and underground
conduits, “drawing” of water, presupposes the knowledge of all the
primitive wheels and similar engines used in Egypt and Babylonia
since prehistoric times: daliya, saqiya, shaduf, cerd (‘Iraq.), drawn by
oxen which go up and down a slope ; in Southern ‘Iraq I have still seen
men drawing the primitive engine, as the king of Aleppo did at the
time of NaramSin. I do not remember where, but I believe I have
seen the largest of these engines, the so-called “Persian wheels or noria
< Arab, naura” in Persia; they are typical for the middle Euphrates
and the Orontes in Syria. The Ir. name dulab is Sem. dul-, dl’, plus Ir.
ap, explained “like a wheel on which water buckets are strung.” 5
Ctesias, Ind. frgm.52M, described the bucket-chains in the royal gar
dens on the citadel of Susa. Aelian and Plutarch, both, misunderstood
him in a curious way: the oxen did not draw a hundred buckets a day
—which would be nothing—and refused the hundred and first, but
drew chains up to a hundred buckets and became refractory when the
weight was more. Aelian uses the words KaSov s “buckets” and avrXeiv
“to pump,” Plutarch mpiaKTa avrXrjpaTa. Skylax mentions such o^erot
on the Indus, and Herodotus speaks of a legendary reservoir and sluices
in Eastern Iran, called Akes, by which the water supply of several large
provinces could be regulated. Though a legend, it proves the existence
of large works in the fifth century b.c. and earlier, of the type of the

“Daily, the water flows from the Ardvisur spring southwards to the
Alburz. There, a hundred thousand nayicak, navica, pipes, made of
gold, exist; that water, because of its warmth and nature(?) [West:
clearness] ascends through these pipes up to the High Hugar. On the
summit of this mountain is a lake; it discharges into this lake, comes
out purified; through a separate golden pipe it goes back, at a height
of a thousand men, from that pipe an open conduit, tak,6a of gold
descends forth to mount Usindam in the middle of the ocean Fraxvkirt.
From there, one part discharges, for the purification of the sea, into
the sea; the other part diffuses over this whole earth for removing?
the salt; all creatures obtain humidity and medicine from it, and it
destroys the dryness of the atmosphere. As the Awesta says etc.”
6 saSurwan, saSrawan, etc., has at least two irreconcilable significations, “curtain” etc. and “fountain” etc., the first prevalent in NP., the second in Arab.; Armen, satrvan, Hiibschmann, Armen.Gramm. 212, combines both. It seems to have passed from MP. into Arab, and back into NP., where it coalesced with a word perhaps of Indian origin. Connection with OIr. cat- is
possible, on the other hand with caflrugosa > cargos “quadrangulum,” caSrusuka > carsu,
“quadrangulum, market,” *ca 9 ru.yuviya > carjuy “dividiculum, castellum aquae,” if one may assume *catur-, not only caSru-. The rare Arab, satura, used as name of the well, 120' deep, through which water was drawn, by a bucket-wheel, to the high level of the citadel of Aleppo, looks like a loanword from Iranian through Aramaic. 6a tak can be the word for “arch.”

The Aw. quotation appears also in Gr.Bdh.j7: “my rdyvsvr ’cs frvt
yhyt' m gbr’ bT.” It is Yt.5,96= 12,24, an old piece in inferior surround
ings:
upa hukaryam brzo on the high Hukarya
vispa.vemam zaranenam the all- . . . , golden,
yahmat haca frazgadate from which leaps down
ardvi sura anahita Ardvi . . .
hazahrai brsna viranam from the height of a thousand men.
“yhyt” is translation, or transcription “zgadet” only, of fraz
gadate, cf. frazyarati in Yt.5,4, and khotan. vi.zgad- “to dis
mount,” Bailey, jras 1942. vispa.vema: vema > vem would be
“crevice, ‘cleft,’ e.g. Vid. 13,37: the dog falls in a cati ‘well,’
vema ‘cleft’ etc. Vid.4,52: he shall be thrown into a vema 100
men deep.” In Hajjlab., the Pahl. vers, has vem, Pars, darrak, for
the phantastic “gorge.” But other Mss. have vispa.vamam, -ava
mam, and in 5,96 vispa.vahmam, hence Wb. “all-gefeiert; im
Urkodex viell. Kurzzeichen fur hm.” The edition is right in
annotating to 12,4: “ob vispa.bamim the only correct passage
with correct meter, Y/.i5,i5 has:
hukaryat haca brzahat vispa.bamiyat zarnenat.
The two epithets are those of the sun-wheel behind Mithra, “of
diamond and gold,” so to be read also in 12,24. The translation
hm’k-svlk of the Bdh., though not clear, supposes a text with
“vema,” interpreted as “perforated” and used as a corroboration
of the theoretical water-works. 7 Such a notion existed at a time
considerably older than the Bdh., for it is attested by the name
“sura zarnumant” in Ny. 1,8, Pahl. transl. surax zarren. Wb.:
“sura, Loch, lacuna’ nur mit zarnumant, Name eines Sees oder
Teiches.” The NP. translation, there, has “alat, engine,” and the
name has water-works, not a pond or lake in mind.
The source for the beginning of the description is Yt.5,5:
ahyasca evanha apo of one of these waters the overflow
apayzaro vijasati (would suffice to be) distributed
vispais avi krsvan hafta over all the seven continents
7 Cf. svl k'wmnd, in the Yama myth, for Aw. suwra, under ‘Yama xscta.’



APAM NAPAT 569
ahyasca evanha apo of one of these waters
hama#a ava.barati an always equal quantity flows down
haminamca zayanamca in winter and summer.
For the idea of “ascending water”: since high antiquity crossing of
river beds and ravines by canals was achieved after the principle of
communicating pipes, with a vertically falling and a mounting pipe.
This is a practical application of “pressure,” a notion not yet recog
nized; perhaps this is what “cihrig, nature” of the water expresses.
The whole picture looks like a mechanized presentation of the pre
Aristotelean Greek belief, see under ‘Sea.’
According to Aryan belief, the god ruling over the waters of springs,
rivers, lakes was ApamNapat, like Neptunus in Italy before he became
one with the Mediterranean Poseidon. In RF.11,35,9 a very old hymn
the locality of which is Sarasvati-Arachosia, he is the god of a fire born
out of the celestial waters, the clouds, which flares up by itself. He
clothes himself in the lightning, that means is the lightning, just as
AhuraMazdah with the heaven as raiment is Varuna. He drives with
“stallions quick as thought,” is called “warrior, ksatriya, procreates all
living creatures,” all characteristics appearing again in Iranian. He was
one of the great ahura, entirely alive in the Veda. But Zoroaster elimi
nated him, and the Awesta preserved only one large fragment of a pre
Zoroastrian epical song, which found a place in the Zam-yaskt 19,46
52: the my tli of the fight for the hvarnah in the ocean.

The redactors have seriously retouched the beginning, but of the fol
lowing stanzas only 48 f-g has been affected. In the strictly symmetrical
composition this verse corresponds to 50g:
48: zam pati (ahuraSatam) #raf?rai (rtahya) geffanam
50: zam pati mrkai ge#anam
Obviously, the mazdayasnian terms are interpolated; the same “zam
(ahuraSatam)” occurs in Yt.5,63 and 65, in the Parva legend, see under
‘Navigation.’ They are as incompatible with the archaic myth as spanta
and ahra-manyus and other mazdayasnian terms interpolated in st.46.
In the original, Ahura-Varuna and an adversary fought for the hvarnah,



APAM NAPAT
572
not in person, but each by sending an “asta.” In Varuna’s case it is his
son Atars. The original may have called him “atars varunahya pu#ra.”
The name of the adversary is lost, aste and asiste are certainly not “acc.
pi. inflected like pronouns” (Wb.), but two duals; there were no more
than two figures. 8 “Bote, messenger” does not render the peculiar mili
tary' meaning of the word: they are “vices, champions” for those who
sent them.
Wb. 7,22 arranges apa#a in 48d under Y'a#- “to ruin,” in every
respect doubtful; Geldner read +apata in regard to afrapatai in
5of. Not these words however correspond, but apa 0a in 48d to
pati uz.nysani and uz rocayani in 50 d-e, and afrapatai in 5of
to uzrocayai in 48c. There is no other clue for the signification
of apa#a but this opposition. 50 d-e speak of “zaSah, Steiss,
posterior” 9 and “zafar, mouth, jaw,” and pati uz.rocayani
means “to blaze out of (the jaw).” Some punishments in hell,
described in Art.Vir.Nam. explain this, e.g. “mnv cygvn m’r-y y
prysp hvm’n’k p‘n nsym byn ‘zLVN.t v p‘n pvmh byrvn y’tvnx”
p‘n pvmh byrvn is “zafar pati uz-”; p‘n nsym byn is “zaSaha
(pati) . . .” Therefore, the “uz” of uxsani is faulty, and pati
is doubtful (ditography from the line before?). The sense must
be “to pass, drive into,” e.g. upa.vaz-, *vazya-, ‘uzani. In parallel
with this rude picture, apa#a must graphically express what
the dragon threatens to do to the fire : to smother, blow out the
fire, perhaps apa + Van- “to breathe,” to a 0ra “breath,” cf.
¥£.19,44 “apana, expire, aushauchen (des Lebens)” and 01 .
“apana, inspire, breathe into.”
The Pahl. translation of ahvarta, “agrift, unseizable” is abstracted
from this tale, but ahvarta can in no way be construed as meaning
unseizable, it means “not needing food,” MP. axvarisnik. That is the
name of the eternal fires of the oil springs at Damghan. As a light,
fire in water, we would say, it lives on liquid, on naphtha.10 The whole
8 In the R^sa m\th, Y/.8,7 and 38, see under ‘Mithra/ several figures are added in a similar way: adaptation to Mazdaism. 9 Wb. 1657 compares OI. hadati, also Gr. crx Speaking of Azi Dahaka’s zaSah may hide a play upon words and perhaps help the etymology of dahaka, cf. the surname humayaka, bene mentulatus, 10 Akk. naptu, explained by saman itti, “petroleum,” as far as I know not attested in high antiqum, might be, if not older than 15th century b.c., a loanword from Arvan, and does not



APAM NAPAT 573
myth plays upon words: The fire says to the dragon: “if you dare to
devour, hvar-, this hvarnah, that needs no food, ahvarta, I will burn
your entire digestive organs,” jaw “hvarna, wherewith one eats,” and
zaSah. It understands the name hvarnah as the “consuming” fire.
Atars, fire of the hearth, son of Varuna, is just as incapable of taking
possession “ham.grfsani” of the hvarnah, as is the dragon. But when
the hvarnah “swells,” extends as far as to reach the ocean Vurukrtam,
ApamNapat who dwells in the ocean, seizes it without resistance and
takes it down to the bottom of the deep sea, because it is his, who is
born out of the waters of the clouds and clothes himself in the light
ning. Here, ApamNapat is the adversary of Ahura-Varuna, and wholly
Poseidon, not only Neptunus. It was Iranian and Old Ionian11 belief
that all springs communicated, deep underground, with the ocean.
Thus, the oil springs, too, belong to the buna, depth of the ocean where
ApamNapat takes the hvarnah.
The conclusion of the poem, the invocation of the god, is in perfect
condition, “yazata, adorandus” appears here in a clearly pre-Zoroastrian
context, and covered by “yazamna.” As in the Veda, the god has the
epithet xsa#riya, and “rsan, masculus” as creator of the naro, warriors.
A “creator” ApamNapat can have no place in Zoroaster’s doctrine.
In Yt.8,4 Tistriya, the star rising from the ocean, bringer of rain, is
described as descendant of ApamNapat. Though perhaps not so old as
“Atar son of Varuna,” this idea is a natural one:
(yahmat) haca brzat hausravaham apam nafSrat haca ci#ram
Wolff-Bartholomae: “(Tistriya verehren wir) vom dem her (yahmat
haca), dem erhabenen, der Ruhm (stammt), (aber) von ApamNapat
(stammt) der Ursprung.” Lommel: “von ihm (yahmat haca) dem er
habenen ist der gute Leumund, vom Wasserkind (sein?) Geschlecht,”
note: “stammt Tistriya von ApamNapat?” Those are meaningless
translations, wrong, because they failed to see that “yahmat” merely
serves to connect an old fragment with the preceding verses. Without
it, the meter is regular, the sentence complete, though the name Tistriya
prevent etymological connection of Napat and naphtha, Neptunus. Cf. AMi.1x.84ff. for an interpretation of the myth. 11 Reason for the interest of the Greeks in natural tunnels, Strabo xi.14,8 the “barathron" of Arsene, and Pliny vi,i26-28 on Aretissa-Thorpitis, and the “speculum” of Elegosine. Also the notion of underground connection of rivers like Indus and Nile.



574 APAM NAPAT
is missing: the fragment stands with good reason in the Tistriya yasht:
“from the high one is [Tistriya’s] fame, from ApamNapat his kind.”
Another fragment, Y/.8,34, makes ApamNapat rule over the distribu
tion of water
apam napas ta apo ahve astvate soi#rabaxta viba^sati
“ApamNapat allots to humanity the portion of water due to each farm.”
The curious sandhi-form “napas-ta,” for which the present shape
gives no good reason, is due to the fact that the fragment is part of an
old poem. It describes the activity of a “mlrab,” as they open and close,
still today, the small irrigation ditches, day and night, by a cut with
the spade, kastra = bil, after a plan of distribution, scrupulously, almost
religiously observed. 12
In Babylonia, where similar conditions created similar institutions,
the weather-god Adad held the function of ApamNapat, with the title
“gugal same u erseti” or “ilani,” gugal of heaven and earth, or of the
gods. He appears almost regularly on the kudurru, boundary stones
and letters of franchise, of the Kassite and post-Kassite periods, in the
second half of the second millennium. From the same time dates offi
cial correspondence on regulation and management of canals and
sluices.13 On the RittiMarduk kudurru, granted by Nebuchadnezzar I,
one reads the typical curses (col.11,41): “dAdad gugal same u erseti bel
naqbi u zununi narati.su limilla sakiki, Adad, gugal of heaven and
earth, lord over springs and rain, shall fill his ditches with mud!” or
(iv,3): “dAdad gugal same u erseti narati sakiki limili u tamirati.su
limila puqutta sir bira likabbisa sepa.su, may Adad, gugal of heaven
and earth, fill his ditches with mud, and his fields may he fill with
thorns, and may his feet tread down the vegetation of the pastures!”,
gugallu forms, more than once, a pair with muserisu, “planter, cul
tivator,” which belongs to irrisu, y/eresu, transl. of Sum. en.gar, e.g. in
the title of Libit-Istar of Ur, “en.gar.zi(d) Uri kl .ma, just irrigator of Ur,”
W'ho had built large canals, “just” because he had made a “Code” which
certainly dealt with irrigation. 14
12 Cf. AMi.1x.S9; Altp.lnschr. 324. 13 A. Waschow in maog.x,54. 14 As far as I know the literature, San Nicolo and Ungnad have first recognized the meaning of gugallu in their Neubab. Rechts- und Verwaltungsnrkitnden\ cf. Pfeiffer and Speiser, asor.xvi
n.41,6.—B. Meissner. Stud. z.Assyr. Lex., MA0c.xn1.S5 and Bear. z. Ass. H'b. in O.I.Ch. Assyr.Stud. 1.1, 1931, distinguishes “gugallu, fisher" and “gugallu, Garten-, bezw. Bewasserungsinspektor,



APAM NAPAT 575
The gugallu is a well known officer in the Nuzi-tablets: “Opening
and closing the canals was strictly regulated by a man called kugallu.
There are many documents concerning the opening and closing of the
canals.” And “The lusaqu were taking the water from the canals and
pouring it into the gardens and fields.” 15 The Nuzi-tablets are slightly
older than most of the kudurru, back to near 1500 b.c. But it is signifi
cant that the office and its projection into heaven is limited to Nuzi
Arrapha, i.e. the northern East Tigris region, and to Kassite Babylonia,
which included the southern East Tigris region, and Luristan as far as
Hamadan. Before the Kassite period, the gugallu is not yet confirmed
in Babylonia proper; in documents of the Achaemenian period, Cyrus,
Cambyses and Darius (in Strassmeier), he appears often. Adad as gu
gallu seems to be not an old Sumerian god, but one of the Subaraean
and Kassite population of the East Tigris regions.
Strabo, 15,1,30, quotes Megasthenes on India: “officers regulate the
rivers, survey the land, inspect the closed canals from which water is
distributed in the oxereia? (irrigation and water-engines), in order
that, in the use of water, all get what they are entitled to,” soiflrabaxta.
In the Talmud, Taanit 20a, the men that distribute the water are called
rysy nhry; at their side are rysy krby, “field-watches,” and guzirpat,
Syr. res gzlraye, these last two Iranian titles of officers not accurately
defined, cf. G. Hoffmann, Syr. Akten. The Qur’an says 54,28: “And
announce to them that the water must be divided between them, every
watering must take place alternatingly.”
One short paragraph of the Iranian water legislation is preserved in
Ah'r.67, where libations to the waters are treated with prolixity. The
Nirang follows the usual classification of waters, best expressed in the
verses Yt.8,41 (see under ‘Tistriya’): “Tistriya, by whom the waters
count [the seasons], the still and the flowing, those in springs and in
rivers, those in canals and in pools.” Dealing with “moving waters”
the Nir. says, in bad orthography and language [Pahl.transl. interim.]
der 2% der Rente erhalt,” from a third gugallu, the doubtful interpretadon of which rests on a gloss “=asaridu”; whereas Ebeling in Reall.Assyr. 1,456 says nothing but “Beamter unbekannten Amtsbereichs auf den kudurru.” 15 Cf. E. R. Lacheman, in R. Starr, Nazi 1,532. I doubt the last point: irrigation ditches are a little higher than the gardens and fields, and the water covers them as soon as they are opened. But the saqu carries drinking water to the houses and yards where people work.

The Awestic text does not speak—as the Nirang. does—of libations,

upon the translation of dastra.masah by “half-as-much.” Bartholomae,

sin; the part must be defined, therefore the Pahl.transl. says “half.” But
that is equally wrong, for neither can libating a little more than pre
scribed ever have been a sin. The ordinance did not refer to libations,
and dastra can be neither Teil nor half. All compounds with -masah

apart from havat.masah “just as much”—are formed with concrete
things like house, handful, fist, buttock, rib, two ribs, up to the ear,
mountain and half a race course, cf. OI. mitramasas, and dastra must
be a concrete noun. In Sasanian script, monumental or cursive, d and
k are similar or identical, and one must emend +kastra.masah, “as much
as a cut with the spade.” aetarjha, gen.pl.fem., “earum,” refers to the
naviya, “of the canals,” so that the Aw. text says: “Without sin, the
frabartar is allowed to divert from the canals as much as a cut with
the spade.” pati.bar- indicates the aim, namely “to the fields or farms,”
and “without sin” indicates an exceptional case.
frabartar: Wb. “eigtl. ‘der herzutragt,’ naml. Brennstoff zum
Feuer” merely thinks of his inferior role at the very late period
of the Nirang., entirely unfit for defining the real meaning of
the office. In the Aw. text he does not deal with wood, but with
water, and fra- is not “herzu” but “forth.” fra.bar- is the general
word for “transport,” in the case of water not “to carry,” but
“to conduct,” cf. aqueduct, conduit. In Vid.5,57 and 58, the abrt,
16 Very ambiguous signs, the usual rendering is n’yvt’k.



APAM NAPAT 577
i.e. ap.brt “water-carrier” stands beside the frabartar, as the saqu
beside the kugallu, and in Nir.82 a third name joins them:
danazvaza. Duchesne, §99: “danuzvaza, danu + uz.vaza.” uz.
vaz- is “to lift,” danu is not water as element, but the flowing
river; thus Dar.Suez: “the Nile which flows, dann [vati] in
Egypt.”17 Pahl. transl. of danuzvaza is “pa rot vazenitarih,”
hence danu = rot, vaza = vazenitan, as n.abstr., the activity of
the man working at the bucket-wheel.
Another paragraph of water legislation is Vid. 14,13: “civat yavat za
. . . yavat esa afs biyarixti upa.0warsti fra.bavat,” speaking of zam
karsyam roSyam, clearance of arable soil, “How large shall the field
be ? . . . such that the [available quantity of] water fra.bavat [lit. be in
advance, ahead] be amply enough for two irrigations,” of course not
“im Jahre” (Wb.) but daily. Benveniste Inf.av. 30: “il faut autant de
terre que cette eau se repande par double irrigation (?) par percement
(du canal).” The last word means upa.0warsti, which the Pahl. transl.
renders by “apar pa b’lyn,” apparently “up to the highest level.” Neither
translation is right: upa.flwarsti refers to time, “in due time,” see under
‘Fravarti.’ This passage and that of Nir.6j belong to the legislation on
apo soiflrabaxta, Yt.8,34.
Duchesne §128 stresses the spelling of frabrtar, assimilated to abrt,
and distinguished from ham.bartar. But this appears only in the gen.
of the n.pr. hmbrf?rv(vnhv’m) of the memorial list of Y/.13, where only
the consonants can be authentic, while as term of profession the word
occurs only in texts of the Arsacid period. The vowels therefore have
no authority at all. But of the greatest significance is the fact that fra
bartar corresponds to OI. prabhartar and Oscian arsfertur, see Meillet
Introdd 360. This priestly office comes down from Indo-European an
tiquity, in full agreement with the immemorial age of the institution.
The danuzvaza works at the bucket-wheel as naq me, the frabartar
conducts and distributes the water to the fields as kugallu, mirab; the
abrt is the saqu, Arab, saqqa. In the Nirang. the frabartar has become a
libation priest, just as the old naq me at the Neo-Babylonian period. But
at the very beginning, frabartar and abrt functioned in the cult of
ApamNapat. Zoroaster abolished what remained of this cult, but the
17 Cf. the names of the Russian rivers: Don=Tanais; Dnieper = Danapris; Dniestr = Danastris; the latter two in Ammian Marc., and Donau = Danuvius (Sallust).



APAM NAPAT

indispensable institutions and laws remained, from time immemorial
to our present day. The introductory chapter of the Hazar Datistan18
is entirely devoted to the legislation on the kariz and the distribution
of water.
If frabartar and ApamNapat appear in Aryan cult, arsfertur and
Neptunus in Italic cult, and if frabartar and abrt designate the mirab
and the saqqa, then, the people that spoke Indo-European, the language
to which these terms belong, lived in a country with subtropical
climate.
Irrigation of an alluvial country with large rivers requires organized
labor and government, a state of things reached in Egypt and Baby
lonia, and probably in Turkistan, long before the beginning of history,
before 3000 b.c. Not only the Iranians, but their ancestors, the Aryans,
were no longer “Steppenhirten,” but agriculturists in the middle of the
second millennium. In Iran, a more primitive agriculture, without
irrigation works, preceded that phase back to the end of the stone age.
I do not know who first expressed the thought, but, had agriculture
been unknown to the gathas, as Nyberg 276 and similarly Hertel
maintain, the gathas would belong to the fifth millennium b.c., a pre
Indo-European age, just as lack of acquaintance with iron, and copper
as only known metal of the “Gatha-Gemeinde” would move this com
munity into the fourth millennium. “Quod non est in scriptis non est
in mundo” is no historical argument, and it is in scriptis. If for example
the autumn “Herbst” is called “patishahya,” a form presupposing the
existence of Ar. ‘patisasia, and meaning “harvest, hahus, of the hahya,
products of the fields,” or if the god Mithra bears the archaic epithet
“krsa.razah, who cuts straight furrows” with the plough, as in Odyssey
xvm,375:
tco K6 fiiSois el (LXkcl SnjveKea vpoTaixoifnjv

then, even neglecting all archeological evidence, agriculture was
older than all remaining scripta. “krsivant, plougher” appears only in
the Arsacid Videvdad, but the fem. krsivatl is, as Ass. karsibuti, name
of a district of Gizilbunda (near Zandjan) in the annals of SamsiAdad V
(823-810), and OI. krslvala corresponds to it. OP. ‘krsva.karana is ren

dered by Bab. girisvakarranu (g before r as in Her. Germanioi :Krm
ana). The result that agriculture was unknown to the Gatha-Gemeinde
proves the premises to be wrong.
Zoroaster says in the “Creation Gatha” Y.44,4:
“ko [drta] apo urvarasca, who holds (in space) water and plants ?”
namely AhuraMazdah; in pre-Zoroastrian concept the Fravarti. The
thought expresses the astonishment at the observation that water always
seeks the lowest spots—the fight against it is the art of irrigation, and
that a grass-blade or a high tree stand upright. But the pair apa-urvare
means especially the cereals of the irrigated fields.
Y-5h7
dadi moi yo gam taso apasca urvarasca
amrtata harvata (follows:) tavisi utiyuti
“give me, thou who hast formed the ox, waters and plants, immortality
and integrity (of body) . . . force and longevity!” Here, the pair is
increased to a triad “waters-plants-ox,” as also in the Frauarani Y.12,7:
“I profess like the waters-plants, the ox.” Amrtata and harvata are
the “projection mythique du dvandva apa-urvare” natural to a people
who live on agriculture with irrigation, and are transcendently opposed
to the earthly pair, which, together with the ox that pulls the plough,
clearly means agriculture.
In Vid. 1,3, a poorly preserved but very old verse—“the apo zmo and
urvara, waters, earth and plants are all sarta, frozen”—the soil is added
as a fourth point. The sentence means: “the climate makes agriculture
and cattle-breeding impossible,” see under ‘Videvdad.’
Thus, only one point is missing, “the labor,” to make full the five
points by which the share of the landowner and the peasant in the
produce of the crops is calculated, even today: (1) soil, zam; (2) water,
ap; (3) seed, urvara; (4) ox, gav; (5) labor. This is 0waxsah, e.g. in
Gath, vidans 0waxsaha gavoi. With the problem of this partition the
verses Y.31,9-10 deal:
9
:
vastriyat va a.ite
hiyat ahyai dada pa0am
yo va noit ahat vastriyo



580 APAM NAPAT
10: at hi aya fravarta vastriyam ahyai fsuyantam
ahuram rtavanam vahos Trasanhiyam manos
noit mazda avastriyo dvanscina humrtois ba^sta
Bartholomae: “als Du es ihm (dem Rind) freistelltest von
den Bauern sich abhangig zu machen oder von dem der nicht
Bauer ist, da hat es sich unter den beiden den viehziichtenden
Bauern als den gerechten Herrn . . . ausgewahlt. Der Nicht
Bauer wird, o M., auch wenn er sich darnach drangt, keinen
Teil haben an der guten Botschaft!”
The verses do not think of a Bos primigenius, and the “free
choice” between becoming the slave of one or the other—be
tween being shot or hung—would be bitter mockery. That the
ox is property of man is not questioned, it never had a choice or
chance, a.ite with ablative is “going away from,” not “to make
oneself dependent”; and the verses are conditional: hiyat, be it,
suppose that:
“Suppose, Thou wouldst let the ox have its own way, to leave either
the vastriya or the one who is no vastriya, it would choose between them
for itself the vastriya.fsuyant, since he is a good patron, a herald of
Good-Will.” 19
One sees that cattle belonged partly to the peasant, partly to the land
owner. The last line draws the inference, the moral from the hypothet
ical case : “Consequently, the bad-vastriya, the one who is no real farmer,
shall have no share, ba^sta in the humrtis!”
Cf. y.43,15: “Noit na porus drugvato hiyat ci^snuso! never shall one
listen to the drugvant!”, and Y.45,1: “noit dbitiyam dussastis ahum
mrnsyat!, not shall a second time saying-things-immoral corrupt the
human world!” Both are morals, inferred from preceding examples,
dvanscina is obscure, but apparently it qualifies the negation just as
“noit porus, never!, noit dbitiyam, never again, nevermore!” hence “not
ever!” 20
humrtis is neither “gute Botschaft” nor “gutes Andenken.” The
verses speak of good and bad farmers, peasants and landowners and
their share in the profit. Along with Vbaxs- “to allot, share,” V mar
can only mean “to calculate, reckon,” like patismar- in Yr.8,5,41, see
19 For the last words see under ‘Hauga\a.’ 20 “dvans” may belong to “dva, two,” certainly not to a hypothetic Vdav- “sich drangen.”

under ‘Tistriya.’ The initial hu-, therefore, is the same as in huya^na
=
+hoyaxna, and in huzantu = Thozantu, an ablaut-form of *hm “to
gether.” +homrti is the addition, Germ. “Zusammenrechnung,” settle
ment of account.21 Hiibschmann, Pers.Stud. 105, posited OP. ‘hamara
< *hamhmara > NP. hamar, “computus, numerus, mensura,” Arm.
hamar “number, counting, account,” and compared e.g. 01. s^smarana
“the counting over (of cattle).” The 01 . word is “round-up, rodeo,”
and homrti would mean the same if applied to cattle only. The last
line says: “(therefore:) the bad-farmer [owner who does not take care
of his land] shall have no share (whatever) in the settling of accounts.”
The harvest is counted in fifths. According to the number of the
points furnished by either the owner or the cultivator, each one re
ceives his number of shares. This partition, still valid today, is an Old
Iranian institution. It went over into the Arab world probably before
Islam, as the term “khammas, i.e. fiver” shows, translated by “farmer,
metayer.
Not many passages show which cereals were cultivated. Vid.3,4:
“Where on earth, zam, is it best? Where one cultivates the greater num
ber of cornfields, yavanam, pastures, vastranam, fruit-gardens, urva
ranam hvar#abaryanam.” And Vid.3,24: “For soil left untilled a long
time is as unhappy ... as a beautiful woman, a long time without child.”
Cf. Ammianus Marc. xxiv,5,i : “ad lucos venimus agrosque pube vario
rum seminum laetos.”
The Gr.Bdh. enumerates 117 (lnd.Bdh. K20, fob 119s) under the cate
gory “yurtak, cereals” among others: gandum, “wheat,” yav, “barley”
[oats seem to have been unknown], and bring brij “rice.”
gantuma > gandum appears in Nirang.28. The placename in NiR,
written g du u t v in OP., kan.tu.wa in El., has been connected
with it, assuming a misspelling, easy in OP., of ta for ma
. But the El.
text is in both cases at variance: gd“umv would be ‘kan.tu.ma.ma,
gdu ut v = *kan.tu.tu.ma; both would be haplographies, but in order
to find gantuma in gandutava one must assume two mistakes, and
would still have the unfitting d for t.

But it would be strange if rice was never mentioned in the Awesta.
Herodotus describes it in 111,100 without giving its name. According
to Athenaeus b.m,no, Sophocles spoke of opivSr) 5 apros in his Trip
tolemus. It was really made known to the western world by the scien
tific staff of Alexander the Great, who described it as they saw it in
Syria (i.e. southern Mesopotamia), Babylonia, Susis, Bactria and India.
Aristobulus’ in Strabo 15,1,18 described how it was cultivated: “rice
grows in enclosed beds, is inundated from dammed up ponds, and
reaped at the time of the setting of the Pleiades”; similarly in Theo
phrast. 23
The name is Skr. vrihi, MP. brinj, brij, NP. birinj and gurinj, de
manding OIr. *vrinj, *vrij; Arm. brinj (j = dz); Syr. bringa. To the
forms with nasal the group Gr. oryza, Aram, aruza, orez, Arab, ruzz
<
aruz is opposed.
I believe the word occurs in Vid.8,86, see under ‘Industries,’ where
one of the products of the long list of industries that used fire is called
para.brjya. It is made in an onya, a vessel of middle size, from urvara, a
cereal. The Pahl. transl. misinterprets the whole paragraph. It seems to
be a drink brewed, possibly “rack,” an alcoholic rice-brandy; the name
para.brjya of the drink would be to that of the rice itself, brjya, like
the name of the pressed homa, para.homa, to that of the plant. The
passage is a late one, and the spelling with b for v would be accounted
for by that late date.
In Y. 1,7 and 2,7, an obscure brjya is invoked beside nmaniya, per
sonification of the “house, family.” The Pahl. transl. observes : “menuk-e
apak usahin hamkar e? ramak e? zurtakan be awzayet, a spirit which,
together with usahin [fifth and last section of day, from midnight to
sunrise] increases the herds of [? or: and] the kinds of cereals.” This
relation of brjya to cereals makes one think of rice as symbol of fertility.
The passages are among the very latest of the Awesta.
Something concerning agriculture is also hidden behind the dark
expression ^sonibya v$0wabya aspanibya yonibya*.24 Wb. misinterprets
“aspan, zu V sav-, nutzenbringend” and separates the dat.dual yavanibya
23 See Bretzl, Botan. Forschg. des Alexanderzuges, 202ft 24 Wb.: “dvandva bei dem jedes Glied mit eincm Adj. verbunden 1 st, falsch ib.x,268.” For fsonl vanflwa alone see under ‘Ard\I.’ In fact, two subst. dsandva stand side by side, in 5.2,
7
fsonl \an0we with aspanaca ysvino (the second pair alone in Y.hajt. 42,2) and in 5.1,7 fsdmbya \an0wabya with aspanibya yasanibsa.

as “yavan-, Getreidefeld” from the acc.dual (not plur.) written yovlno.25
“Barley-field” would be a more accurate translation, also of yavacaranya.
Hertel, Siegesf. 102, explained yava.ni by “barley as horse-fodder” and
aspa.ni as subst. “horse-breeding,” in analogy to fsoni < ’pasu.ni “Vieh
zucht,” more exactly “sheep-breeding.” fsoni is formed like pecunia.
This view needs a modification.
Today, horse-fodder is “kah u jaw, chaff and barley”; “jaw u gandum,
barley and wheat,” thus already in Sur Afr.: “vas asp mart e juvan, vas
yav apak gandum, many horses and young men, much barley with
wheat.” No oats. But the famous Iranian horse-fodder was MP. aspast.
It had passed into Akkadian, as aspasti, already about 700 b.c., in the
so-called “Garden-tablet” of Marduk.apal.iddin, and appears, even ear
lier, in the n.pr. of a chief of Uila, Nairi country (NW Media) aspasta.
tauk, third campaign of SamsiAdad V, 832-810 b.c. The book Xusr.Ret.
says the onager lives on “aspast u yav.” Also in the Karn.Art., Noldeke,
p. 54, aspast is mentioned. Noldeke explained it in zdmg,32,4o8 as aspa
+ Mad- “to eat.” 26 The Arabs explain aspist by fisfisa, lucern, purple
medic, or clover, trifolium. It is medicago sativa,27 and was so charac
teristic for Iran, that the Greeks called it simply 17 /v/jSikt) 7roa, a name
first appearing in Aristophanes’ Equites v,6o6, in 424 b.c. Strabo says:
“We call the plant which is the main fodder of the Nesaean horses, be
cause of its being plentiful there, simply medike, medic.”
aspa.ni may signify the pastures of *aspasta.
25 ,yavo.hva‘ in F^.17,3, united with yvny- under yavan in Wb., is on the contrary a separate word: “xrafstra . . . spis nama . . . yam martiyaka yavam yavahva nizgahanti vastra vastrahva,” Wb.: “Getreidespeicher”; spis, spis, after NP. spus/s “Laus, Milbe u.a.,” “the hrafstra named louse which eats the people’s corn in the lofts and the garments in the closets.” Those are no lice,
but meal worms and moths, yavahva—in this ungrammancal passage—may be a flour-chest or pot. 26 The init. a/i/u of NP. aspist, and i/u in the second syllable makes the etymology difficult: those vowels secondarily developed before init sp-, but the a of aspa does not fall. The same unexplained case is OP. Aspadana (Ptolemy), but MP. spahan, NP. Isfahan. 27 Cf. B. Laufer, Sino-lranica, chap. “Alfalfa."



XXXIII. TISTRIYA and SATAVESA
“I’ll sail upon the dog-star!”

Purcell
Med. tistriya, OP. *tis<?riya > ‘tisya1 is the Iranian name of Sirius in
Canis Major, the brightest fixed star and the nearest to our solar system.
It is the ao-TTjp oTrcopeivos of Iliad 22,26, where Achilles is compared
with it; often simply called to aarpov. creipios dcmjp appears first in
Hesiod, then the subst. creipLos, still before the star was included into
the Canis configuration, o-eipios is used for scintillating stars in general,
and Eratosthenes and other astronomers interpret it by bid tt)v tt/s d>Ao
709 KtvrjcrLV. Aratos of Soloi, first half of the third century b.c., says:
09 pa paXicrra otjea creipiaeL, the star shoots his rays. This has a bearing
on the Iranian etymology. J. Markwart, Sudarmenien 15*, explained
tistriya as “star flashing rays,” with reduplication as in 01. tisthami;
Germanic strala “ray,” means “arrow,” like the MP. NP. name of
the star, tlr < tigra. The etymology, again, has a bearing on history:
whether a linguistic correspondence exists between Ved. tisya, Ir. tis
triya (OP. *tisya) and Gr. seirios, at any rate, the names are all based
upon the same notion, and the star seems to have been one of the
primeval IE. divi.
The eighth month of the Iranian calendar and the eighth yasht are
dedicated to Tistriya. The last part of this yasht, st.50-61, deals with two
themes, a dissertation on Tistriya’s rehabilitation under Artaxerxes II,
2
and a short, archaic sacrificial rule, see under ‘Mithra.’ Leaving aside
Yt.8,37-38, with the highly archaic invocation of mithra-ahura (also
under ‘Mithra’), a fragment of the R^sa myth—adequately inserted
into this yasht since Rxsa is Tistriya transfigured into an heroic
“archer,” sepak-tlr—two groups are prominent among the remaining
stanzas, by form and content closely connected in themselves, but also
with each other. They apparently once formed an old hymn, the maz
dayasnian revision of which we own in Yt.8.
As in other old yashts, the invocation of the individual god was fol
lowed by a series of epithets, of which the present st.2 and 4 are a col
lection. St.2:
1 Probably Gr. Tissaphernes < OP. usya.hvarnah, MP. Tisfarn in the Mahrnamak.
2 It includes the st. n, 15, 17, 19 and 24-25.



TISTRIYA AND SATAVESA 585
arusam ro^snam fradrsram The white, bright, far-visible,
v(i)yavantam besaz(i)yam ? , healing,
rava.fro#manam brzantam snorting-in-running, high,
durat vyawantam banubyo radiant from afar with rays
ro^snibyo anahitebyo bright, immaculate.
Not all the epithets are of necessity authentic. The first three, accord
ing to Y?.io,68, are in reality those of Mithra’s horses; in Y/.i3,8i they
are misused to describe the “fravarti of AhuraMazdah.” “Snorting-in
running” is another epithet typical of horses, used in Yt. 17,12 for the
horses of Rtis. They may have been actually applied to Tistriya, who
could assume the shape of a stallion.
vyavant appears twice, a repetition the more difficult to accept, as the
word counts for three syllables at the first, for four at the second place,
there connected with banubya. This is covered by Yt.iy,6, where the
same group is a predicate of Rtis, and by RV.x,6,2 bhanubir vibhava.
Hence, the epithet is of Aryan antiquity, and its etymology is vi -f
Vba-, which may well express the twinkling of the star, agreeing with
Eratosthenes’ interpretation of seirios. One must read +vyawantam or
+viwantam; the fem. viwatl is the epithet of Usa in Yt.5,62, Parva
legend. The first vyavantam stands for this or a similar word of four
syllables3 which formed an octosyllable together with besaziyam, for
this adjective is proved to be genuine by st.43 “he heals all creatures.”
Another epithet, drva.casman in st.12, usually translated “with his
healthy eye,” means “with the good” as opp. to “the evil eye.” St.4:
tistriyam staram revantam We worship Tistriya, the star
hvarnahvantam yazamade r. hv.,
afsci^ram suram brzantam of water’s kind, strong, high,
amavantam dure.sukam powerful, flaming far off,
(brzantam uparo.karyam yahmat)
haca brzat hausravaham from the high one is his fame,
apam nafSrat haca ci#ram from ApamNapat his kind
The last two lines have been discussed under ‘ApamNapat.’ revant
hvarnahvant are the standing predicates of the star, as raya hvarnahaca
of the fravarti. In the yazamade formula and where the words appear
3 Cf. the double vylgana in Y/.io,6i. Such grouping of words all but identical in sound is a rule in Arabic stjle. For viwatl see under ‘Navigation.’



TISTRIYA AND SATAVESA

in the nominative, they are metrical, tistriyo reva hvarnahva. dure.suka
is a variant of durat viwant in st.2.
It is only in Y/.8 that afscitfra appears in an authentic context, and
zmasci#ra and urvaracidra, in which “earth” and “plants” replace
“water,” appear also in st.39 of the same yasht. Thus, afsciftra seems to
have been an original attribute of Tistriya. In Y/.8 “from ApamNapat
is his kind” follows; therefore afsci#ra designates Tistriya apparently
as “son of ApamNapat,” and subsequently assumed the general ac
ceptation “stars kindred to water” in analogy to “stars kindred to earth,
plants.” The Men.Xrat interprets it as “increasing the waters.”
St.4, with invocation and epithets, was the beginning of the old hymn,
and just as in the original Mithra hymn invocation and epithets were
followed by the god “driving out,” thus here st.25 joins without hitch
as to form and content:
yo avaSat fravazate who drives out from yonder,
Xsoidniyat +haca usayat from the queenly Dawn (Usa),
dure.rvesam pati pantam on the track with distant turning
bagaha^tam pati yonam on the course laid down by the
gods,
fra^warstam pati +zrvanam in the appointed time.
We have studied this stanza under ‘Fravarti’ with its original, Yi.
13,53-58. There the fravarti show their course to the stars, waters and
plants, bagabaxta is a term of the polytheistic religion, and so are other
concepts revealed in the verses that form part of this old hymn. The
mazdayasnian revision which the verses suffered during the Achae
menian period has not obliterated this fact.
Upon this introduction, st.4 (+2) and 25, followed the first part of
the hymn, consisting of st.5, 36, and 41-42.

sequence has not been disturbed in the present yasht; they are separated
only by misplaced insertions. The verbs patismarante “they calculate”
and hispasante “they look out,” alternate, as do the subjects, pasu-vira
in 5, with aruna-sizdra in 36; keta “sage” in 5 with Tatugut “chronol
oger” in 36—incomprehensible as they appear to us separated by thirty
one stanzas. Further, yarcarso “fields” with mountains and prairies in
36, with “waters” in 41. These heterogeneous beings are not arranged



TISTRIYA AND SATAVESA
588
according to inner relationship; on the contrary they are in thorough
confusion: domestic cattle, several classes of men, fields, other men,
wild animals and water—apparently with the intention of illustrating
by such diversity the power of the star.
The first part of each stanza is a relative clause, the second a question
:
“When will he rise?” In 36, where the question is short, two accusatives
of participles, uzirantam and uzjasantam, are added to the verb, which
have the value of the questions : will he rise, will he appear ? Both refer
to the beginning of the period of visibility, not to the hour of the rising
in the single nights.
patismarante—see under ‘Arithmetic’—to V mar-, “to mark,”
has here, as in later language, already the meaning “to count,
calculate.” Answering the question “when?”, it is the seasons
regulating the life of these beings that are counted.
St.5b-c: Bartholomae: “die Menschen (die) friiher Gewalt
taten veriibt haben und die kaeta, (die) zuvor boslich gehan
delt haben, sehnen sich. . . .” Lommel: “Die Menschen, die
friiher Unrecht getan haben ? und die keta? die friiher gelogen
haben.” Note: “Weshalb? Wird dem Tistriya eine siihnende
Wirkung zugeschrieben ?” The translation “sich sehnen” is
wrong, and drsvan belongs to drzvan in Yt. 1,27, Vdrz-, drang
“to make fast,” cf. drzana.pr#a “incurring (the punishment of)
chains,” and handraxta, handunga, Arab, habasa “to settle,
Germ, festmachen” a waqf, and “to arrest, imprison.” A mar
tiya drsvan or drzvan is a man “in fetters” who has reason to
“count” the months of his punishment to which the “cazdah
vant, MP. amar vicartar” has sentenced him (see under ‘Last
Judgment’).
For keta see under ‘Arithmetic.’ paro druzyanto means the
same as “yoi purva mi#ram druzyanti” in Yr.10,5, “who for
merly committed a crime against Mithra” or—with mi0ra =
societates et amicitiae—“had become mi#radruxs.” There and
here, the words, used as though meaning “punished for an old
crime” or “keta, criminals of old” are a reduced paraphrase of
the full, genuine formula Y/.i3,3o:
an.azarta ebyo nrbyo vahvis yoi vo vahvis gufra
frasruta vanat.prtana noit parva azarayanta



TISTRIYA AND SATAVESA 589
“who are gracious, the good ones, to those men who never gave
you, the good, deep ones, that—praised—grant victory in bat
tle, reason to be angry,” lit.: “not-wroth at those who do not
make you former ones wroth.”
paro druzyanto is a wrongly inserted gloss and entailed the
meaningless insertion of paro between martiya and drsvano.
The whole sentence has lost its metrical form, which may have
been
yim [vispe] patismarante
pasu storaca ketaca
martiyaca yoi [or: martiyakaca] drsvano
or more than that.
To 5ft Wolff-Bartholomae: “Wasserquellen (die) starker”
[and similarly in Y/-5,7 of Ardvi’s arms], in st.42 “umfangrei
cher als ein Pferd(eleib) sind.” aspa.stavyah does not refer to
size, but to power, as in the frequent formula “power of ... a
horse, ... a mill-trench.”
To 36a: yar.carso martiyahya cannot mean a full year; yar
must be a certain term of cultivation. 36b: The text has ahura
Xratuguto, Wb. “Ratschliige erteilende Eiirsten,” Lommel
“raterteilende Herren.” Princes and lords “command,” have
not only an advisory quality, and why should they, between
fields and rapacious animals, “yearn” for Tistriya? In the
original song they correspond to keta. xratugut is a clerical
error for "ratugut, “chronologer,” with ahura “calendar-maker,”
see under ‘Arithmetic.’ For the pair “aruna sizdra” see under
‘ArdvI.’
Lommel translates 36 e-i: “Nach ihm (blicken aus) die Lan
der mit guter Ernte, wenn er aufgeht, und die mit schlechter
Ernte” with the slight change of the case of dahyave. Thus he
makes the people look out, not before, but while the star rises,
and whether the harvest (which comes after the star) had been
good or bad, and makes the question “will the harvest be good r”
unnecessary. Bartholomae has the right construction: dahyave
is dative of purpose; huyarya duzyarya are possessive adjectives



59O TISTRIYA AND SATAVESA
“he who brings good, bad harvest,” both in the instr. of quality
“he rises as one with good harvest.”
To 41 b-c: The second and third pair of waters specify the
first “still and flowing.” Duchesne distinguishes between drota.
stat, root-noun with t-enlargement in the second member (stat
-Lat. -stes) “being in water-courses,” and between #rotas.tak,
with root-noun as agent, only attested as acc. -tacam \Wb. “mit
auffalligem a”] “running in rivers,” cf. navi.tak under ‘Apam
Napat.’ In Y.68,6 parsuviya and variya “waters in canals and
ponds, cisterns,” are called “winter-waters” because they collect
in winter.
To 4ad: The figura etymologica yzaram awiyzaram has a
similar meaning as the question in st.5: “When will they flow
again?” 42c: In Vid.i, soi#ra and asah mean the province and
its capital, cf. Isfahan as “most populated asah, town,” in the
commentary to Vid.2,23 under ‘ArdvL’ In passages as old as Yt.
8,42, the words still designate the villages and the irrigated fields
around them. Pahl. transl. is rotastak < 0rotastak, NP. rostag,
Arab, rustaq. The stem of soi#ra, Vsi-, is also that of siti, sayana,
all designating fixed settlements.
42g: The meaning “stalk, stem” of varsaji has been deter
mined by Bailey, jras 1934, 505b, starting from the Pahl. transl.
aSvan > evan; “Wurzel, root,” as Wb. translated, is Aw. ru0
mis, MP. resak. Therewith Bartholomae’s translation of
vaysayante va^sa “spriihend benetzen” falls, the words mean
“they make grow.” The error entailed the more momentous
misinterpretation of vazdris uxsyati, see below, and under ‘Har
vatat.’
Between the stanzas in which all beings look out for Tistriya’s rising,
and the following ones which tell what he does after it, a connecting
sentence, predicating that the star appears, is indispensable, and this
sentence stands today in st.32 a-c:
32: us pad aSat histati Up, then, he rises
tistriyo reva hvarnahva Tistriya, ,
zrayahaSa vurukrtat from the sea Vurukrtam.
The remaining verses of 32 d-i deal with Satavesa and are displaced.



TISTRIYA AND SATAVESA 591
The authentic form of the ablative zrayahaSa vurukrtat is preserved
only in st.47, and all corrupted forms must be emended accordingly.

The original order of the stanzas has not suffered. The st.14-15,
17, 19, 24-25, here omitted, are the interpolated tirades on Tistriya’s
rehabilitation, see under ‘Deva.’
In SL13C (and 16c, 18c) the text has, “krpam re#wayati
roxsnusva vazamno,” without meter, and made worse by the
following nars krpa etc. Yt.845, another inferior passage, has
“afsci#resva savistai yo afsci#rebyo / ati roxsnusva vazamno”



594 TISTRIYA AND SATAVESA
“to Tistriya, the mightiest among the afsciflra-stars, who with
the afscii9ra comes driving among the luminaries.” The double
afsciflra reveals a systematic division of the stars in afsciflra and
others, conflicting with roxsnusva which includes all. The sys
tem is younger than the hymn. The first part of 8,45 is no verse,
the second is; the beginning has been added to the end which
is a quotation taken from st.i3c. “ati” must be inserted into the
gap of two syllables in 13c. It had to be suppressed, when krpa
reflwayati was introduced there. Whatever the primary meaning
of reflwaya be,4 here it is a syn. of framita in Yr.19,29: framita
aspahya krpa, “to transform, disguise.” The authentic text was
clearly “Tistriya [comes] among the luminaries in the shape
of . . But a general predicate, “Tistriya rises up from the sea
and assumes [three] outward shapes, in the first three nights
one, in the next another ...” is indispensable between 32c and
13a. The verse “krpam reflwayati” is two syllables short and best
filled by #raya “three” or tisro with plur. krpo. When this good
verse, originally placed before the description of the three forms,
was put into it, three times, the number tisro had to be omitted.
St.i8f: I do not know of white horses with yellow mane and
tail, but such was the imaginary picture of the Tistriya-horse.
zaranya.awiSana, Pahl. transl. zarren vaydan, NP. expl.: “its
ruy, jaw, cheek (01. srakva ‘mouth’) is of yellow color”; ruy
serves also to explain patidana > MP. padam “which they bind
round the jaw, bar ruy mibandand, while singing prayers.”
OIr. awiSana evidently belongs to 01 . abhidani “halter”; MP.
vaydan is not etymologically connected with awiSana, but
lives on in Osset, vidon, to which the significations “halter, rein,
bridle, bit” are ascribed. This cannot be right, because a halter
has neither reins nor bridle, and reins and bit are different
things.
Darmesteter translated awiSana by “caparagon, saddle-cloth,” Bar
tholomae “with (golden) bit,” Lommel, who interprets also Aw. awi
4 M b.-, “retfssayati, denom pres, of rctfsva ‘Vermengung,’ related to Gath, roitfsvan.” Benveniste, Inf.ar. 32: injonctif de souloir: "que soient remplis" viz. the celestial spaces with light. Pahl. transl. sime^t agrees with Sh.ihr.Er. §38, flight of Spandarmat before Frassak: “andar 6 zamik gumext, after hasing mixed, concealed herself in (her) earth.”



TISTRIYA AND SATAVESA 595
Sati in Y.9,26 by “Anschirrung,” translates “with golden harness
(Geschirr).” All this cannot be, for, just as Vrthragna in Yt. 14,23 and
25 appears as a wild tragelaphus and ibex, thus Tistriya appears as a
free horse, not as a broken saddle or carriage horse, and he could not
fight Apavrta with bit, bridle or harness. A “halter” is tied round a
horse’s head, or the horse is tied to something by the halter. OI. abhi
dani and Aw. awiSana, therefore, do not belong to Vdha-, riOppL,
but to Skr. V da-, di, Gr. Sea SiStjpu “to tie,” represented in OIr. by Gath.
ni.dya(tam) “to shackle,” OI. a.dyati. awiSana and patidana are closely
related to Gr. diadema.
Strabo 15,15 describes the padam which the priests “bar rux mlban
dand”: eTraSovcnv . . . irph tov Trophy . . . napas TrepiKtlpevoi iriXcora?
KaOeiKvias eKarepcodev P-^XPL T°v Kakvirreiv tol rrapayva
OtSas, and so they are represented in art from the time of the oldest
pictures, the Median tombs and the gold sheets of the Oxus treasure,5
down to the very last Sasanian coins. The tiara is like a Turkish bash
lik, with its long tips tied around jaw—paragnathis—and mouth. The
Sasanids wear it under their crowns, evidently made of silk thin as a
veil. In Yt.5,123, where Anahita is described as drazimna, seizing with
her hand, the patidana, this cannot be ( Wb.) “ein auf der Brust (unter
dem Panzer) getragenes Brusttuch,” but only such a veil, a KppSepvov.
And in Vid. 14,9, the list of the equipment of a raflesta, where it appears
after “zraSo, cuirass” between “kuris, collaret ?” and “saravara, helmet,”
it seems to be a felt tiara with cheek-pieces worn under the metal hel
met or separate cheek-pieces attached to it. Like awiSana, patidana
belongs to V da, di, “to tie.”
The opposite of the golden awiSana of Tistriya is awiSata.trsti in
the description of Apavrta. The preceding verses paint Apavrta as black
horse with hairless ears, mane and tail. It has the “mange,” daya, to
Vdag- “to burn.” Thus, awiSata.trsti has two qualifications: it must
be something continuing the line “ear, mane, tail,” and it must be op
posed to zaranya.awiSana. awiSata means “wearing, provided with an
awiSana.” Under ‘Fravarti’ roxsni.awiSata, epithet of the fravarti, has
been discussed: it corresponds to XnrapoKpTjSefjLvos, epithet of Demeter,
and refers to the hair-dressing of the fravarti, forelocks and plaits at
the temples. All Assyrian and Achaemenian sculptures0 show the
6 Cf. preliminarily I.4E p.lxxvii and lxxix.
5 Cf. IAE figs.

horses’ forelock artificially dressed and plaited, with ribbons, in some
cases so unnatural that one may think of a wig, cf. the Victorian “bangs,
Germ. Pony-Haare.” The awiSana of the horses are these dressed and
plaited forelocks. roxsni.awiSata means “wearing ro^snu ‘light’ as awi
Sana”; in awiSata.trsti it may be either “terror” or—fit for the demon of
drought—“thirst.”
St.2ib: deva, as adj. of apavrta, according to the original
concept a serpent or dragon that keeps back the rain,7 may
signify “worm, serpent, NP. kirm” 8 but the deficient meter of
all the verses in which devo yo apavrto appears makes it more
likely that deva replaced an older word of three or—since yo
is dispensable—of four syllables.
To 23 and 29: “Woe to me, woe to you waters!” is genuine,
but AhuraMazdah with the mazdayasnian religion are notions
younger than the myth, interpolated by the redactors, sadram
and usta are the exclamations themselves; the n.abstr. ustatat
is the action “shouting hail!”
St.29: a.pati.rta is “uncontested” viz. by Apavrta; cf. the syn.
pati.prtati in Yt.5,50, Husravah’s racing, under ‘Poetry,’ and
apatiyaraklh “being beyond contest” as term for the state of the
world after the victory of the good principle. Lommel trans
lates as.danu and kasu.danu by “with many, with few grains,”
which would imply good and bad quality, while the distinction
can only be one of kind, fields with corn and pastures with
grass.
The three times ten days are the month Tistriya. After these thirty
days the star fights Apavrta. In the first round, which lasts three days
and nights, Tistriya is defeated; he is victorious in the second round
only, which ends “at the time of midday.” One asks at once: of which
day? The verse mentioning the day is lost, but the strict parallelism
of the verses leaves no doubt as to its being “#riayaram ^ri^saparam”
as in st.22,9 and that these words got lost when the invocation “O

Markwart recognized that in younger legends Frahrasya represents this figure of the old m>th. 8 Cf. de\a as adject, to zarmyangura, a “harfstra,” under ‘ArdvI.’ 9 The same three nychthemera in the Parva legend, see under ‘Navigation.’



TISTRIYA AND SATAVESA 597
Zoroaster” was interpolated; the myth is pre-Zoroastrian. Tistriya ap
pears three times ten days in the sky, fights Apavrta twice three days,
and disappears on the 37th day in the ocean until his reappearance in
the next year.
Therewith myth and hymn might be complete, in analogy to the
fight for the ahvarta hvarnah in Yt. 19, where, after two rounds between
the Fire and the Dragon, ApamNapat carries away the hvarnah to the
bottom of the deep sea. The Tistriya myth, however, did not end there,
but had a continuation in a few stanzas, similar in form and content,
which speak of the star Satavesa.
Upon the setting of Tistriya in st.30 a-c followed next the rising of
Satavesa in 32 d-i, the stanza from which we have detached, above, the
verses a-c, the beginning of the Apavrta fight. 10

St.33 a-b: Wolff-Bartholomae: “und dann kommen die wol
kenbildenden, asa-heiligen Nebel herangezogen,” that is nom.
pi. and intrans. verb.—Lommel : “dann lasst er (Satavesa) die
frommen Nebel, die wolkenbildenden (? oder: der Wolken
macher) herbeiziehen,” that is verb caus. and acc.pl.—frasau
payati of the text is a wrong contraction of archet. prs Vpyty;
like the adv. frasam, this frasa is used with ellipsis; cf. Yaio,8:
Mithra “frasa upascindayati, destroys beyond (repair)”; Yt.
14,3: the arrow “frasa ati, flies beyond (the target),” and the
abstr.n. frasa.krti “making (the world) beyond (contest).” upa
yati, which Wb. attributes to a theme ya-, is, in view of the com
mon act. upati, certainly a causative. The subject is meyakaro
(thus inst. of -kara). In a hymn of high antiquity rtavan is out
of place as epithet of “fog”; it is a mazdayasnian substitute
for a word of four syllables, subject of the sentence together
with meyakaro, probably “sataveso.”
St.33: purvo vat^m vazati and pasceta vazate are opposed
like parva.nemat and paska.nemat in Yt. 16,2, and mean two



TISTRIYA AND SATAVESA 599
opposite points of the compass; Lommel translates “Ostwind”
and “westwarts.” Stars and fogs arise from the zrayah, ocean,
at the Ushindu, the “mountain in front of, opposite (the mouth
of) the Indus,” and the wind blows the clouds over the Aryan
countries. Since the whole conception is connected with the
stars whose appearance differs with geographic latitude, not
longitude, purva and pasceta can only mean “southwind” and
“northwards.” The gen.pl. vatam in 33 is as doubtful as the form
vato in the function of a nom. plur. in several passages, purvo
vat^m, in the Indian Ocean, should be one of the monsoons,
called ul-havand, lit. “up-lord” (SW) and frot-havand, “down
lord” (NE) in the Bundahishn (under ! Sea’). Iran lies outside
the monsoon zone, but her winds and rains are indirectly con
nected with the monsoons.
uzirat, uzirantam—regular term for the rising of the stars—and
uz;asantam in st.5, 36 and 41-42, mean the beginning of the period
of visibility, for only visibility, not the changing hours of the nights,
is relevant to the thoughts and hopes expressed in these verses. On the
contrary, pati avati in 20 and 26, the stanzas of the fight, means a single
setting of the star, because it takes place for a special action. In st.30,
as it stands in the yasht, no action follows. Why does Tistriya go into
the sea ?
us pati histati of 32 recurs once more, in Yt. 19, where it means the
resurrection of the dead. Referring to Tistriya in 32a, to Satavesa in
32d, it means the rising of the stars after their long period of invisibility.
There is no connection between Tistriya’s setting in 30a and his rising
in 32a. The end of 30 “in shape of a white horse etc.” must be expunged,
as a mere repetition of 18, 20 and 26, for it is illogical that the star
would assume a special shape to become invisible. Therefore, st.32 a-c
stands in a wrong place, and its right place is, as in our text, before
i3ff., the description of the three shapes the star assumes. There, the
verses bring the fulfilment of the hopes expressed in the preceding
verses, and at the same time introduce the three shapes of appearance.
The sequence of st. 30, 32, 33, 40, 47 is convincing as to thread of
thoughts and syntax. In 30 a-c Tistriya sinks below the horizon for the
current year, in 32 d-i, Satavesa rises for his period. The text has “us



600 TISTRIYA AND SATAVESA
aSat histat,” which seems to be borrowed from 32a; the meter is wrong,
perhaps “us at pati sataveso histati reva hvarnahva.” St.32i, yo histati etc.
“which rises in the middle of the sea Vurukrtam” is a gloss in prose, as
is the inadequate line 33! on the path of Homa. When Satavesa rises,
fogs, dunman (32d) gather round the Us.hindu mountain whose place
according to its name is “in front of (the mouth of) the Indus,” cf.
Pomponius Mela’s “insula contra Indi ostia.” St.33a repeats dunman;
the words at tat, exceeding the meter, come from 32d and disconnect
awkwardly the two dunman. The meyakara Satavesa makes the fog
increase “beyond (measure)” and the south wind drives them north
wards. The final verse, again, contains the word meya, beside vara
“rain.” The text adds fyahvam “hail,” out of place because the verses
do not suggest destruction. St.40 begins with the wind blowing the
clouds over the whole world. They are called “full of rain, full of apo,
waters that bring good crops,” and this apo is resumed in 47 : the waters
fall on the lands where Satavesa is worshipped. The plur. fem. of the
participles in 40 cannot possibly refer to the neutr. meya, and instead
of the unconvincing construction proposed by Bartholomae the diffi
culty solves itself by exchange of huyarya and yahuva at the beginning
of b and c; then, the participles refer to the fem. apo.
Lommel who, on principle, regards all yashts not as the conglomerate
they are, but as a unit of parts of equal value, interpreted Yf.8 as “the
myth of the generation of rain by Tistriya”: “Der Kampf des Sternen
rosses mit dem daemonischen Ross ist der zweier briinstiger Rivalen
um die Wasserstute. Nach Besiegung des Nebenbuhlers steigt der Ster
nenhengst in den(?) See hinunter und vollzieht da mit der Wasser
stute [interpretation of st.8] die regenerzeugende Begattung, deren
stiirmische Gewalt das ganze Meer(?) zu wilden Wogen erregt [inter
pretation of st.31]. Es schliesst sich treffiich an, dass er danach aus dem
See emporsteigt [st.32 a-b] ohne weiter auf den Regenfall und die
Verteilung des Wassers einzuwirken. Das bliebt andren Wesen iiber
lassen [st.33], unter diesen dem Stern Satavesa.”
Nothing compels the assumption of a “water-mare”; the myths of
the hvarnah or of Indra-Vrtra, too, have no Andromeda figure. Y/.8,8
from which the mare is abstracted, is an excerpt, in ungrammatical
language, of 8,46, and this again an imitation (with reminiscences of
Yt. 10,14; 8,31 and 33) of similar verses in Yt.5,4-5, which say, in correct



TISTRIYA AND SATAVESA 601
language: “vispe varis acarati . . . aspahe krpa arusahe, he visits all
gulfs of the sea, in the shape of a white horse,” disfigured in 8.8 to
“baSa varim acarati aspo.krp^m asaonim.” This abortive phrase does
not prove an old mythical concept of a “water-mare.” And st.31, “ho
zrayo a-, vi-yozati, a-, vi-yzraSayati, a-, vi-yzarayati” (reminiscent of,
the rest quoted from, Yz.5,4) is at the best a grammatical exercise of a
pupil, not the effect of the mythical mating. If there ever was such a
concept, it would have been the climax of the tale, there was no taboo
against plain speaking. Lommel continues: “In 32 ist es mit der durch
die Vereinigung von Hengst und Stute vor sich gehenden Regener
zeugung nicht zu vereinbaren, dass auch Satavesa zugleich oder un
mittelbar nach Tistriya aus dem See emporsteigt. Da nun aber der
auf Satavesa bezligliche Satz in 32 aus dem Metrum fallt, so vereinigen
sich formale und sachliche Kritik dahin, diesen Satz vom Text aus
zuschliessen.” And yet he regards Satavesa—thus eliminated—as the
subject of st.33.
What he takes umbrage at is no “criticism of content,” but applica
tion of the scale of human decorum of the twentieth century to the
mythical animals. The meter, too, is no fit “criticism of form”: the Tis
triya verses are as deficient as those on Satavesa. For instance, the stand
ing epithets tistriyo reva hvarnahva are metrical only where the formula
appears in the nominative; nars krpa panca.dasaho is metrical, but the
analogous “shapes” in 16 and 18 are not. In trying to restore the meter
one would give to the verses an authenticity and an archaic character
to which they have no claim. Lommel’s investigation, if right, could
only lay bare what the redactors thought when dissecting the old hymn
in just the way they did. Meillet called such yashts an “ensemble de
fragments que des redacteurs denues d’art et de pensee ont mis cote a
cote.” To uncover their thoughts is useless; what matters is solely the
“fragments authentiques dont l’interet est grand.”
In the present arrangement of Yr.8, Tistriya seems to be the subject
of st.47, but no name is mentioned, and to whom the adj. savista refers
can only be inferred from the true connection of the stanzas. A glance
at the existing translations is enough to show what the redactors have
made of the beautiful hymn: the clouds are blown away because
Tistriya wants to chase witches from the ocean, the rain falls because



602 TISTRIYA AND SATAVESA
he visits all gulfs etc. Therefore, st.43 too, although in its present posi
tion Tistriya seems to be its subject, must be attributed to Satavesa:
43: vispais nenizati sima
apaya vazdris crysyati
vispa(s.ta) daman bisazati
He washes off all illnesses,
(with water?) he makes grow the
healing herbs,
he heals all creatures.
These verses enlarge on the thought of 47c: tata rva#ra besaziya. The
edition gives vazdris with cod.Fi, but }io has vazdars. Wb. interprets
it erroneously as participle “(mit spriihendem Wasser) fahrend”; Lom
mel leaves it open: “er lasst alle . . . wachsen.” “All,” though not in
the text, is right: instead of apaya, ’py, one must read vispe, vspy. An
dreas interpreted vazdvar in Yt. 14,29, tanuvo vispaya vazdvar as “lead
ership.” It is related to Gath, vazdah in Y.49,10, dvandva vazda ava
mlra, which, through “vazdris, medicinal herbs” finds its explanation
as “nectar and ambrosia,” see under ‘Harvatat.’
Likewise as physician, this time under his own name, Satavesa is
described in the poorly conditioned verses of Y^.8,9:
at ta apo frasavayati
sataveso
avi hafta.krsvaris
vyahva yat jasati sriro
histati ramaniva
huyarya avi dahyus
(kaSa arya dahyavo huyarya ba
vanti)
Those waters, then, Sataveso
drives forth,
to the seven regions,
v/hen the beautiful one arrives at
child-birth
he stands (still) peacefully
over the lands with-good-harvest
The question at the end is a meaningless repetition of st.36. The re
mark about the krsvar, ungrammatical in form, comes from st.40,
apparently caused by “huyarya,” common to both and probably unau
thentic. The words are preceded by “Tistriya goes into the sea and
makes the waters surge up,” i.e. the surf of the sea. Then: “Satavesa
drives these waters . . .” in fact other waters, viz. the clouds. The fissure
is evident. Nor is there any connection with the following st.io. We have
just a short disconnected fragment. Previous translations went astray
in seeking a context of eschatological meaning, vyahva (loc.) appears
once more in Y/.i3,io ( = 22 and 28), where the fravarti uphold the



TISTRIYA AND SATAVESA 603
embryos so they will not die in birth, vyahva (see under ‘Fravarti’).
The same signification is possible here: the fragment said something
about the star’s favorable influence on childbirth. The god who has
power over seed and crop is also a healing god.
Satavesa appears only once more in the Awesta, in Yt. 13,43-44.
43: ta hrzanti satavesam antar zam asmanamca

tat.apam uxsyat.urvaram

etc. as in 43.
The fravarti let go Satavesa
between earth and heaven,
him who pours rain, hears when
called,
him who pours rain, makes grow
the grain
for the protection of cattle and
men,
for the protection of the Aryan
provinces,
for the protection of the five kinds
of animals,
for the help of the pious men.
Between earth and heaven
Satavesa travels along,
he who pours rain, hears when
called,
he who pours rain, makes grow
the grain,
the beautiful, radiant, with intense
light,
for the protection etc. as above.
zavana.srut, OI. havanasrut, also in Y/.io,6i, has the thematic
inflection of the late language, an indication that the verses are
not of a high antiquity. In ¥^.19,35, ApamNapat is called za
vana.suvam (acc.) Wb. “helping,” perhaps better “healing when
called.”
The two stanzas disclose the method of the redactors: st.44 is the
very original, in faultless meter, narrative form, nominative of the third



TISTRIYA AND SATAVESA
604
person. The epithets in e are old and genuine. In 43, the same stanza
is subordinated to the main idea of the Fravartin-yasht: the fravarti “let
go,” put into motion the stars—and with them Satavesa—like race
horses. The formula ta hrzanti causes a faulty meter in b. The effect
does not go farther, because the accusatives, by chance, have the same
number of syllables as the nominatives. Where this is not the case, as
in e: sriram banuvantam ro^snamantam, they are dropped.
St.44, thus, has nothing to do with the fravarti. The song to which
it belonged existed before the redaction of the Fravartin yasht, and
the verse was introduced into Yr.13 only to give one example more
of the power of the fravarti. The fact that the name of Satavesa appears
in the Fravartin yasht does not in the least prove that the star was
known while the conception of the fravarti as spiritus moventes of the
universe was still alive. Tistriya, who surely was known at that high,
pre-Iranian antiquity, does not appear in Yt. 13.
On the other hand, the verses of Yr.13,44 might well be part of the
old hymn in Y/.8, where their place would be between “us histati”
and “at tat dunman” in st.37, or after st.47. There are other examples of
fragments of old songs scattered over more than one yasht.
Not all the three formulae with 0ra#rai and the one with avahe are
of necessity original. They may have been fashioned after the model
of Yr.13,10 for use in Yr.13,43, and then been repeated in 44. But since
the “Aryan provinces” appear in 36 in the question “will they have a
good harvest?” the formula “for the protection of the Aryan provinces”
in Yt. 13,44 must be considered as genuine. Satavesa, further, is con
nected in Y/.8 with the mountain Us.hindu “in front of the mouth of
the Indus,” therefore, Indus-Sind was reckoned among these Aryan
provinces. It was a new conquest of Darius and remained part of the
empire till the time of Alexander. Consequently the Satavesa verses
were composed between these time limits. The mazdayasnian redaction
they have suffered cannot be older than 400 b.c., the composition goes
back before this date.
That is all the Awesta has preserved concerning Satavesa. He ap
pears in a myth of the middle Achaemenian period as a star rising after
Tistriya. Tistriya appears 30 nights in the sky, fights and defeats in 6
nights the demon Apavrta who keeps back the rains. After thus having



TISTRIYA AND SATAVESA 605
freed the waters, Tistriya sinks into the ocean. From then on Satavesa
rises and with him come clouds and rains. In scientific language that
means : the heliacal rising of Satavesa takes place on the 37th night after
that of Tistriya and is the beginning of the rainy season.
This myth, as the entire yasht, describes Tistriya as the natural adver
sary of duzyaram, “bad year, bad harvest, famine,” the work of Apavrta.
The stanzas on Tistriya’s rehabilitation express this thought by saying:
“He fights parikam ya duzyarya yam martiyaka avi duzvacaho huya
ryam nama djate, the bad-fairy Bad-year, whom vulgar-speaking peo
ple call ‘Good-year.’ ” In Yt.%,^6 the same essential quality of Tistriya
is the reason for his rehabilitation, see ‘Return of the Gods’
“yat zi - - arya dahyavo +awi.sacyars 11 datiyam yasnamca vahmamca
ya0a he asti datiyatamo yasnasca vahmasca noit i#ra arya dahyavo
frans hyat hena noit voiyna noit pama noit kapastis noit henyo ra0o
noit uzgrfto drafso, if the Aryan provinces would observe Tistriya’s
worship and praise as prescribed by the law, in the way the worship
and praise strictly following the law (datiyatama) should be,
neither hena, nor flood, nor cattle-plague, nor pestilence, nor the chariot
of the enemy, nor the(ir) lifted banner would come over the Aryan
provinces.”
The author first speaks in a prolix official style, then, falls into verses
or what were verses, duzyaram “famine,” indispensable because of the
relation of st.56 to 15, 53 and 55, and because of the entire tenor of the
yasht, is here omitted. On the other hand, hena “hostile host,” i.e. war,
is overemphasized by adding raflo “chariot” and uzgrfto drafso “ban
ner.” In Y/. 14,48 where the same verses reappear, but addressed to Vrth
ragna, god of war, such emphasis and the omission of famine are jus
tified. Hertel’s attempt, in iiqf vn,i57, to scan the verses as they stand
makes only more apparent how badly they are preserved, hena and
henayo ra0o etc. cannot have been separated by all the intervening
words; uzgrfta drafso certainly was a compound adjective to hena,
as in the only good passage where the word recurs, Yii.13,37: fravartayo
puruspaSa uzgrfta.drafsa. When restoring duzyaram, indispensable in a
11 IE6.I533 attaches awi.sactars to V sak- “konnen, lernen" (not attested with prev. awi-) with the hypothetic meaning "wenn sie diichten an.” In view o£ awi. sak-, Gr. t7rio-7i-6/tei'os = awi
+ Vhak-, I prefer reading +awi.sacyars "to observe.” The frequent confusion of s and s goes back to manuscripts of the period after ArdashTr I, e.g. in the script of the Pahl. Psalter, medial s and s were scarcely distinguishable.



6o6 TISTRIYA AND SATAVESA
Tistriya hymn, and when replacing the negation noit by ma, as required
after detaching the verses, we obtain as original form
:
ma i0ra arya dahyavo frans hyat (io) Not shall come here over the
Aryan provinces
hena uzgrfta.drafsa ma ra#o (io) a hostile host with uplifted
banners, not a chariot,
ma duzyaram (4) not famine,
ma voryna ma pama ma kapastis (10) not flood, not cattle-plague,
not pestilence!
Such a prayer, not addressed to any special god, and perhaps origi
nally composed in verses of ten syllables, could easily be used with
slight modifications for one or the other god. The yashts offer many
analogies for such a procedure.
In the inscription Darius Pers.d one reads
mana oramazda upastam baratu (12) To me Oramazda shall bring
succor,
hada visebis bagebis (8) with all the gods
uta imam dahyaum oramazda patu (12) and O. shall protect these
provinces
haca henaya haca dusyara (10) from hena, from dusyaram,
haca droga (4) from droga!
abi imam dahyaum ma ajamya (10) Over these provinces may not come
ma hena ma dusyaram ma droga! (10) not war, not famine, not
droga
!
The Awestic verses speak of war, flood, cattle-plague, pestilence, and,
originally, of famine, all naturally associated ideas. In the inscription
it is war, famine and a religious-philosophical abstraction, droga. That
is not popular, all but incongruous. Droga does not belong to this
sphere, but has been introduced for the sake of a religious theory, which
is also expressed, several times, in the Behistun inscription, thus in §10:
“droga dahyava vase abava, droga did as it liked in the country,” or
§54: “dahyava ima tya hami^flya abava droga.dis hamif^iya akunos tya
ime karam adruzyasa, the provinces here, which became disloyal, droga
made them disloyal, because those (the men named in §52) made the
people drug-ish.” At last §58:



TISTRIYA AND SATAVESA 607
haca droga darsam patipayahva Beware strictly of droga!
yadi avafla manyahe (8) if ye think thus:
dahyaus.me drva ahati (8) My land shall be safe!
There, too, the author, at the end, falls into verses. In Pers.d, voiyna
“flood,” one of the group war, famine etc. is lacking, and it is obvious
that the not-pertinent notion of droga supplanted voiyna. The original
text once was: “ma hena ma dusyaram ma +vaiyna.” That means, the
Awestic passages and the inscription have a common source. Darius’
scribes follow the same rules as the redactors of the Awesta: both in
troduce Zoroastrian notions into pre-Zoroastrian verses. But the redac
tors of the Awesta did not retouch just these verses, and thus it comes
to pass that in this case the inscription is more Zoroastrian than the
Awesta, which used the pre-Zoroastrian form at a time when Tistriya
was reinstalled by the data (datiya datiyatama of Y^.8,5-6) given by
Artaxerxes II. The designation parlka duzyarya “bad-fairy” for the
neutr. duzyaram reveals an even later shifting of the original concept,
scarcely older than the gloss “whom people of vulgar language call
huyarya.” As in the analogous passages of the Videvdad, the vulgar
language means Pahlavi as opposed to Old Iranian, and the gloss
belongs to the Arsacid period.
While there is general agreement about Tistriya being Sirius, the
identity of Satavesa is still an object of controversy. M. P. Kharegat 12
recognized in Satavesa the star Canopus, a result accepted by Sayyid H.
Taqizadeh.
The name Canopus, Gr. kanobos, is of Egyptian origin; the Greeks
saw the star in Rhodus, under 36° 20' N. lat. The Indians called it
agastya; Iranian satavesa means “with a hundred slaves” similar to MP.
hazarbanda, “with a thousand slaves.” The Babylonians called it
mulNUNkI
, “Eridu-star,” because it represented that port of the Persian
Gulf in their macrocosmic system. The Arab, name is Suhail. It is the
brightest fixed star after Sirius, in the constellation Carina of the South
ern hemisphere.
Recently H. Henning contested Kharegat’s identification and went
12 In his dissertation The Identity of some Heavenly Bodies mentioned in the Old Iranian Writings, The Jamshetii Jejeebhoy Madres^a Jubilee Volume, 1914, 116-158, a book, the copy of which I owed to the friendship of the author.



608 TISTRIYA AND SATAVESA
back, as J. J. Hess13 before him, to Saussure’s old equation Satavesa =
Antares in Scorpius, on the strength of one positive and one negative
reason. The negative reason is the great southern declination of Cano
pus, which is not visible north of about 37 ° N. lat. “The scholars who
are inclined to find the ‘home of the Awesta’ in northeastern Iran,
(e.g. in Merv), will be unable to accept Kharegat’s opinion.”
The Awesta, resembling the Bible in that it took about a thousand
years to grow, has no “home.” The home of its redactions were the
studies of scholars, and it is irrelevant where they lived. Those who
speak of the “home of the Awesta” do not see clearly the essential dif
ference between two unconnected things, epical and religious material.
Epic and similar tales, of which the Awesta preserves fragments, have
a fixed place on earth; the oldest, pre-Iranian stratum has places outside
Iran. But hymns and prayers are not bound to a specific locality, and
the periods and regions of their origin must be determined in every
single case for intrinsic reasons. Those are the unknown quantity, the
probandum, and if in our case the identity of Satavesa and Canopus
Suhail can be proved, the declination of the star has the ascendency
over the inclination of modern scholars: al-‘alimina sharafahum al
Suhailu.
Iran extends between 25 0 and 37
0 N. lat.; in Susa (32 0
) and Per
sepolis (30°), one sees Canopus even as in Babylon and Memphis. The
Satavesa verses date from the middle Achaemenian epoch, and since
the mention of the name in Yt. 13 does not link it to the old-mythical
concept of the Fravarti, and there is no common name in Skr. and OIr.
for this star, nothing supports the assumption that the Aryans had
known it in prehistoric antiquity. Thus the negative objection is of no
consequence. Kharegat, foreseeing it, wrote p.21: “An object need not
be visible throughout a country to be taken notice of by its people. The
knowledge of terrestrial objects such as mountains, rivers, etc., is not
confined to the region in which they are visible, and a different rule
cannot apply to a celestial object.”
Like Tistriya, the cloud-maker and rain-bringer Satavesa rises from
the sea Vurukrtam, in which stands mount Us.hindu; of Tistriya it is
also said that he sinks into the same sea, from which the rain comes.
The scholars who search for the home of the Awesta in northeastern
13 Cf. Orient. Stltd.Parry, i and Le systeme cosmique sino-iranien , J.As. 1923.



TISTRIYA AND SATAVESA 609
Iran or beyond, consider the sea to be the Caspian, and yet locate the
home of the Avvesta in Marw, Sughd or Balkh, where the Caspian is
just as invisible as Canopus, and where one could only form the belief
that the stars sink into that sea, but never that they rise from it. Only
people living round Astrachan at the mouth of the Wolga could form
such a notion. And the Us.hindu mountain alone forbids the identifica
tion of Vurukrtam and Caspian.14
Henning’s positive reason is : the name satavesa enters into that of the
17th Sogdian moon station, myn-sdvys, which corresponds to the 17th
Indian station mula and the 19th Arabic station shaula “sting of the
scorpion,” as recognized by E. Sachau.15 Henning says : “Although Sgd.
myn is not known, we may safely infer that myn-sdvys is a kind of
appendix to that star (or constellation) that bore the name Sadves.”
He concludes: “Satavesa is scorpius, or its main star Antares.”
This conclusion is not safe. If Sadves had ever been the name of the
entire constellation, myn could not mean “sting,” for Sadves does not
mean “scorpion.” The analogy rests merely on this impossible meaning
of myn; hence, there is no reason to assume that the constellation of
Scorpius was ever called Satavesa. The Greeks too did not deal with it
under a single name, which means that the concept of one great con
stellation is not that old. myn can be any qualification to Sadves, e.g.
one distinguishing the star from the real Satavesa, as Kharegat assumed
where he deals with the equation myn = mula = shaula: “The names
Satavesa and Sadves are the same, but I do not think that the stars
are the same,” with reference to names of stars occurring twice and
more times in Arabic and European astronomy. The Arabs count, I
believe, five Suhails, distinguished by qualificative adjectives.
General reasons, most of them adduced by Kharegat for his identifica
tion are: Gr.Bdh .: “The seas of the southern quarter are under the
protection of Satves, just as the seas of the northern quarter are under
that of Haftrang (Ursa Major).” As chief of the southern stars, Satavesa
must be a very bright star, and Canopus is second only to Sirius-Tistriya,
with whom he is linked in the yasht, and to whom he is near in time
and space. The star was also venerated by Egyptians, Babylonians,
14 See under ‘Sea.’ Only Hertel is consequent in transferring all these names into heaven. But in history such celestial conceptions are projected from earth into heaven.
15 Albiruni’s Chronology, transl. 288. Sdvys is Iranian, and as an Iranian word myn would be “naked.”



6 I0 TISTRIYA AND SATAVESA
Arabs and Persians—Anwar i suhaill! The Arabs call Sirius one of the
“Sisters of Suhail,” the other one is Prokyon in Canis Minor. The
Indians ascribed to their Agastya the power of purifying the water, as
the Iranians similarly did with their Satavesa. At last, a cogent proof
in itself, the “sea Satavesa” was part of the Indian Ocean, see under
‘Sea.’
A
star as southern as Canopus cannot have been known to the Aryans
in their aboriginal home, the Duab of Turkistan, but only in their new
abodes, India and Iran. Therefore it cannot have a common name
inherited from Aryan antiquity. If the names of the star were etymolog
ically the same in Skr. and OIr., it could not be Canopus; but the names
differ, and the triple identity of Agastya = Satavesa = Canopus is there
fore possible.
In his refutation, Kharegat made his calculation for Lambda Scorpii,
not Antares, a difference not important for our problem. Lambda Sc.
rose heliacally, in the latitude of Iran and about 500 b.c., about five
months after Sirius. Canopus, on the other hand, in 25 0 N. lat. 34 days
(July 9-Aug. 12), and in 30° N. lat. 41 days (July 14-Aug. 24) after
Sirius. The Apavrta myth makes Satavesa rise on the 37th night after
Tistriya. A calculation for 400 b.c. and 30° N. lat. (Persepolis) would
reduce the small difference between 41 and 36 days by half a day.
That fits, whereas the five months’ difference between the rise of Tis
triya and Scorpius would make the whole concept of the myth impos
sible.
Furthermore, Lambda Sc., and so Antares, are zodiacal stars, and
Satavesa was not one of them, for Vand-Hormizd says in the Say. ne
say. 14,6: “If one of the zodiacal stars is visible besides Tistar, Vanand
(Wega) and Sadves, the day-period (gas) is to be kept on, otherwise
it is to be given up.” It is not only in this passage that the three great
stars are opposed to the zodiacal stars. The idea behind the rule is: they
remain visible when the twilight has already extinguished the zodiacal
stars. Therefore Sataveso cannot belong to the constellation of Scorpius.
The definition of Vand-Hormizd is the remark of a late astronomer;
for the people who formed the myth and arranged their peasant’s life
in accordance with these stars there was no such distinction, only a
divine rain-bringer in the sky. Kharegat quoted reports from modern



TISTRIYA AND SATAVESA 6ll
gazetteers, e.g. that of Kacchi:16 “The stars by which the cultivator is
guided are Katti, Brah. Paur (Pleiades), whose appearance in the early
morning in June heralds the period when floods may be expected;
Treru or Trangar (Cassiopeia) which appears about the 27th of Sanwar
(July) and bids the cultivator hasten his preparations for sanwari sow
ings; Ludho, Brah. Ludav, appearing about the 15th of Bhaira (Au
gust), a signal to the cultivators that the season of Juar sowing is
over; and Sohel (Canopus) with its forerunner or ‘witness,’ shahid or
agawan, which warns the cultivator [Y.44,5: ya manoflris cazdahvan
tam ar#ahya] that the end of summer is near, and that his buffaloes
will shortly cease to soil in the water. Thus Katti and Treru govern
the Juar cultivation, the principal sanwari crop, whilst Ludho and
Sohel are the stars which guide the cultivator in all matters relating to
the wheat, the principal crop of the Sarav harvest. Sohel is believed
generally to bring three showers of rain in its train. . . . The cultivators
believe these conditions to be universal on the whole earth.” 1 '
Unintentionally and unknowingly, this picture is almost a paraphrase
of those verses of the yasht in which everything is counted by the rise of
Tistriya. Anaxagoras said: “Cane ascendente messem, descendente vero
terrae cultum homines exordiuntur.” The conditions in southern Iran
today are the same as those the Iranians encountered when immigrat
ing. One cannot import them from one home under a different sky to
another climate. The conception must be that indigenous to the coun
try.
There was an old rain-god in Elam whose cult still lingers on in the
sanctuary of Nabi Daniel at Susa, situated between the palace mound
and the river.
16 By Major C. H. Minchin, p.65. 17 Kharegat corrected: “The names in Kacchi are Sindhi, in Makran etc. Balochi. Katti, from Skr. kfttikah, are the Pleiades, Bal. Paur from Ir. paro, parvln; they rise heliacally in Balochistan on the 6th or 7th of June. Treru, Trangar, Bal. tlrband, i.e. ‘girdle,’ is not Cassiopeia, but the row of three stars forming the ‘belt of Orion.’ The date, 27th of July, is too late about a fortnight, reason: shifting lunar months. Ludho, from Skr. Lubhdaka, the ‘hunter,’ is Sirius. Date, 15th of August, is probably too late about a fortnight, same reason. Sohel is Canopus; in Las Bela it is called Aith < Skr. agastya.” In §28 he remarks: “Sohel-Canopus-Aith, heliac. rise in
25 0 N.lat. 23,viii, in 30° N.lat. 3,ix, seems to be the principal star of Balochistan. It gives its name to the autumn season consisting of September and October; to one of the nine periods of 40 days each into which the agriculturists and flock-owners divide the year. The Brahois give the name Sohel to the month corresponding to Hindu Ass in, the Marris call the autumn crop Soheli.”

The Syriac Chronicle Noldeke-Guidi, a.d. 670-680, tells: “The Arabs
took Susa. They occupied the house there, called the house of St. Daniel,
seized the treasure kept and guarded in it by order of the kings since
the time of Darius and Cyrus, and they took and broke the silver
sarcophagus, in which was lying an embalmed body which many be
lieve to be that of Daniel, others that of Darius.”
Tabari 1,2566: “abu Sabra [leader of the first Muslim conquerors]
was told, there is the body of Daniel in this towm! He answered: What
does that matter to me? and left it in the hands of the inhabitants.”
Tabari 1,2567: “abu Musa al-Ash‘ari [abu Sabra’s successor in 18 h. /
639 a.d.] wrote to ‘Umar b. al-Khattab about it, who ordered the body
buried. Abu Musa wrote back: The corpse had a signet-ring, we kept
it! The caliph answered: Use it! And on this stone was the figure of a man between two lions.”
Baladhuri, 278: Abu Musa saw in the citadel of Susa a curtained
room and was told that it contained the body of the prophet Daniel”
[a later variant, used already by Sir William Ouseley, adds “a prophet,
though a minor one”]. This relic was believed to have the power of
bringing rain. Baladhuri and Tabari speak of it and all the later sources
amplify and confuse their stories. Baladhuri adds: “abu Musa had the
tomb dug in the river bed.”
Istakhri, about 340 H./950 a.d.: “I have been told—Allah knows best
that in abu Musa s time a sarcophagus was found in which they say lay
the bones of the prophet Daniel. The people of a book [Christians and
Jews] used to move the coffin from one to the other of their temples
in order to obtain rain through its blessings, wherever there was drought
[detailed stories]. But abu Musa [objecting to the continuous removal
of so venerable a relic] took it, carried it to the river at the gate of Susa,
diverted the river through a canal, constructed three tombs of brick
work in its bed, and buried the coffin in one of them. After having shut
and covered the tombs, he opened the water-gates and let the river
flow over the top of their vaults. Thus it does to the present day. But
he who dives to the bottom of the water finds there those tombs.”
Benjamin of Tudela who visited Susa between a.d. 1160 and 1173*
dwells, as all the others, on the miraculous power of the tomb and the
rivalry of the inhabitants of the two banks for exclusive possession of
these blessings. He refers the burial wrongly to Sindjar Shahinshah,

i.e. the great Seldjuq who died in 552 H,/ii57 a.d., and built the present
shrine. 18
The excavations of Susa19 have brought to light a burial of the Achae
menian period which fits exactly that description: a skeleton with rich
ornaments in a bronze sarcophagus shaped like a bathtub. The engrav
ing on the seal, a man between two lions, is the most common icono
graphic type of Achaemenian seals. The description of the Arabs proves
that the sanctuary they saw had a tradition back to the Achaemenian
period, but it was much older. At Der, modern Badrai, on the road
from Susa to ‘Iraq, main town of that region in the 4th millennium,
the snake-god mus, son of the main goddess Nana, “queen of Der,”
and “mar bid, heir” of Der—who is closely related to the main god of
Susa, Insusinak son of Innana—had two temples, one “sa pan biti, in
front of the (main) temple,” the other “sa birit nari, in the river.”
The burial of Daniel under the river was apparently no spontaneous
idea of abu Musa. It is an old Muhammedan belief that Joseph—until
Moses carried him off—was buried under the Nile, in order to let both
shores of Egypt partake of his blessings, barakat, the motif of the stories
of Benjamin of Tudela. Alaric, king of the Goths, was buried under a
river: “Nachtlich am Busento lispeln bei Cosenza dumpfe Lieder.”
On the whole, the story is a good example of the law of the perma
nence of places of worship : an immemorial cult of an Elamite weather
god has been continued, in transformations, from religion to religion.
The last time the minor prophet exercised his power was during my
visit in 1928, when Riza Shah Pahlavi asked me to show him Susa.
He decided to rest one day at Dizful, and Farman Farma, Flruz Mirza,
Sarim al-daula, Timurtash, minister of the Court, Dawar, minister of
Justice—rahimahum Allah!—drove over, that day, to Susa. After walk
ing over the ruins we had an opulent picnic in the vaulted passage
around the tomb-chamber, overlooking the boundless eastern plain. I
felt strange and saw a black cloud, the size of my hand, on the horizon.
So I proposed returning, which we did at once. The cloud came up and
in less than an hour invaded half of heaven and earth like a wall of sand
and dust, blacker than the thickest London fog. In the early afternoon
it was dark night. Then a thunderstorm broke loose with a deluge of

rain, like unto the end of the world. It was the end of the journey of the
Shah. Next day, the whole Aryan province of Khuzistan stood several
feet under water. I did not tell anybody of Daniel’s power, not wanting
to be accused of having provoked the rain-bringer’s wrath by our ir
reverent luncheon: azarto ebyo nrbyo yoi parvam azarayanta.
The mythical thinking of the peoples in new surroundings absorbs
local notions without abandoning older ones. If, then, we find overlap
ping and contradictory ideas, if, in Iran, ApamNapat, Ardvi, Tistriya
and Satavesa all are active in the same field, it is because the concepts
of different phases and regions coexist without having been brought into
a system. Everywhere local conditions are believed to be universal, as
the gazetteer remarks.
The concept of Satavesa as rain-bringer is autochthonous and Elamite.
The Iranians associated it with their picture of Tistriya. Satavesa is
not a name or a figure of the “Aryan Period,” but had been known to
the Iranians since the Achaemenian time.
That is long before in a.d. 1000 the name myn-sdvys appears as that
of a lunar station in the Sogdian lists, clearly as a term of scientific
astronomy. Sadves is a Persian name; possibly myn, unknown in
Sogdian, is Persian too. Such scientific terms cannot be projected into
high Sogdian antiquity, especially not in this case, for the idea of lunar
stations is not an old one. But just as the Arabs multiplied their name
Suhail, so the Sogdians, who could not see that star, may have admitted
its name, qualified by myn (not = “sting”) as a second Suhail into
their nomenclature, when they took over Hellenistic and Persian
astronomy.
In spite of the objections raised against it, Kharegat’s identification
stands: Satavesa = Canopus = Suhail, and the region and period in which
the hymn was formed is determined by this identification, not by the
inclination, the bias of modern scholars, to find the non-existing “home
of the Awesta” in northern Iran: al-suhailu sharafa l-‘alimlna.



XXXIV. ARITHMETIC and ASTRONOMY
Man has always counted. The faculty may be one of the fundamental
distinctions between a human and an animal’s brain. Numerical sys
tems based on 4, 5 and 10 are derived from peculiarities of the human
body, and are primordial. Not without reason, numbers are the most
persistent words in all families of languages. Epicharmus said: 6 /3fo?
avdpa>TTOL<; \o-yurpov xa.pi9p.ov Setrat ttoXv.
At the end of the stone age, property marks appear all over the world
on pottery. Mason’s marks and other fabrication and trade marks are
invented for calculating the payments. The cattle was branded with
marks, Ir. da^sta, Akk. simmanu, Arab, wasm, in order to facilitate
the counting. Slaves and other possessions, too, had marks : Cain bore
the “oth” of God on his forehead. Property marks and calculating pre
cede writing and are the origin of script. Deliveries were noted by
notches—“kerben, carving, scribere”—on the tally—“Fr. taille, Germ.
Kerbholz”—or “chalked up, angekreidet.” Until our time, “boumaerke”
were the legally valid signatures of peasants in Nordic countries. The
marks develop into letters, the tallying, “ritzen” becomes “writing.”
The oldest prehistoric written documents, of the fourth millennium,
the proto-Elamite tablets of Susa and of Tepe Siyalik as well as the
proto-Sumerian ones of Jamdat Nasr are all accounts, deliveries to tem
ples and similar lists. The great bulk of their contents are numbers.
Iranian had many words for reckoning, e.g. OP. Vvan- “calculate.”
In Median and Achaemenian Iran people counted everywhere, the
army—hence the numbers of dead and prisoners in the Behistun inscrip
tion; the post—hence the milestones, parasangs; the financial offices
hence the clay tablets of Persepolis and the bills of Murasu Sons, the
banking house of Parysatis.
Aw. han.karaya > Arm. angarem, MP. NP. angardan is “to enumer
ate, tell, tale,” cf. Hiibschmann, Arm.Gramm, 97. In Yt.i it means “the
yasna is celebrated for the account (dat.) of those mentioned.” The prev.
ham-, like Lat. cum, Got. ga-, enters for the abandoned IE. distinction
between determined and undetermined action of the present- and
aorist-stem of the verb: OP. darayami “I hold, own,” ham.adaraya “I
have taken possession of.” The noun han.krmo in Yt.5,9, derived from
ham.karaya, with the dative “xsatfrai aryanam dahyunam” means “he



6l6 ARITHMETIC AND ASTRONOMY
who counted to, incorporated in the empire of the Aryan provinces,’
see under ‘Mithra.’ han.krda, in 17. 19,56, Pahl. transl. “u.s hangartakih,
and its sum is (3 lines, 4 ranks, 5 ratu)”; also han.krti “addition, ac
count,” cf. upa.krti in Pap.El. “drawing up of an account, estimate of
costs,” under ‘Navigation.’
V mar-, smar-, orig. “to mark, note,” assumes the meaning “to count”
not only in MP., but has it already in hamarakara “accountant” in Ezra
and the Papyri > MP. amarkar=Arab. amil “subgovernor of a dis
trict”; equally Gath, homrti, see under ‘ApamNapat,’ “settling of ac
counts.” Hiibschmann quoted 01 . “sasmarana, counting over (of cat
tle)” = roundup ; Wackernagel Skr. “smarana, recalling, counting over.”
In the song to Tistriya, Yr.8,5 and 41, “yim . . . patismarante” means
“by whom count, reckon”; it would be bad if it meant as one translates
“to yearn for,” for in Y/.5,ii the immaculate Ardvisura “driving on the
chariot” would then “yearn for men (coll.sg.),” whereas she “counts,
remembers” the many “who praise me, bring offerings.” Likewise,
Mithra’s scouts who sit on their towers along the roads, in Y/. 10,45, do
not “long for,” but “count” the passersby. Herodotus describes this
traffic-control after Hecataeus. Aw. patismar- persists without semantic
change in Sogd. pcmrtyt (plur.) “counted.”
Mazdah is the best accountant, sahvar.maristo, Y.29,4, and in the
Tistriya yasht not only gods and men, but animals and inanimate
nature count the seasons by the rising of Sirius. Thus already the star
gazers of Ammi.saduqa looked out for the rising of Venus for their
calendar calculations in old Babylon, or the Assyrians in Kanes for
the “plough-star.” Since times primeval observation of the stars has been
needed for cultivation, and its practical result is the calendar.
Therefore, in the verses Yt.8,5 and 36, we find, among the men that
look out and count, the keta and +ratugut.
^ratugut—of the text—is a fault, an assimilation to ^ratukat “philos
opher” in YiU3,i6 for Yatugut, with ratu “apportioned space of time”
and gut- to V gu-, whence OP. abi.zavaya, Tpahl. a^gudan, NP. afzu
dan “to increase,” opp. vigav- “decrease.” When—as in in- and de
crescere—the preverbs abi- and vi- make the verbs antonyms, the sim
plex (cf. Wb. V 2gav- “verschaffen” and 2gona) must express, like “to



ARITHMETIC AND ASTRONOMY 617
grow,” the notion of changing size or of measure, near to that of num
ber. Cf. Gath javaro in Y.48,8: vahos manyos syo^nanam javaro, Wb.
605: “etwa ‘Abwagung’ der guten Taten der Menschen beim Jungsten
Gericht.” +ratugut means the “time-measurer, chronologist, calendar
maker.”
The signification of keta, with which it stands in parallel, has been
determined by the newly discovered TPahl. words qydyq’n v m’rygr’n,
Henning in bsos 1X584. maregar is “conjuror, charm-maker.” Henning
connected qydyg with keta in Y/.8,5 and keSan in the Karnam.Art.
There the sense comes near to “astrologer,” though MP. star.sumar was
hardly a MP. neologism, but already in OIr. the general term, and the
real meaning of keta remains unknown as long as its etymology is not
determined.
Zoroaster did not admit sun, moon and stars, the old “heavenly deva”
into his AhuraMazdah. This rejection of the heavenly bodies as a group
recalls the same rejection in old Israelite and Muhammedan religion,
and seems to have had similar reasons: not to adore something
“created,” and not to allow similar cults of foreign nations to infiltrate.
Astronomy flourished in Babylon, and Zoroaster’s rejection had the
effect that occupations like that of observing the stars fell into disrepute.
The gathas say little about celestial bodies. Only in Y.30,10 we find a
term hitherto misunderstood.
Y.30,10: ada zi ava drujo bavati skando spaya^rahya
“Then, collapse of the spayaflra of the Druxs will come to pass, but
those will partake of the promise of the good abode of Vahumano,
Mazdah and Rtam, who in (their) good renown are deemed worthy
(of it),” see under ‘Myastra.’
The following etymologies have been advanced for spaya#ra:
Bartholomae, Wb.: “Gedeihen, Erfolg, Gluck; Zusammenfall
von *spaia- zu V*sav- und *sphaia- zu \ /3spa-” Andreas, nggw,
1911, 10: “spayafha (fur spay0
-) um Bartholomae’s guter Kom
bination mit *sphay- gerecht zu werden.” Salemann objected
that, according to Zoroastrian conception, the Druxs could have
no “luck.” Hertel, Siegesf. 98 and 190, speaks only of Vsu-,
and remarks: “spaya#ra bezeichnet, wie fhvaesah, im Awesta
nur [both are hapax] das daevische Himmelsfeuer,” and Beitr.



6i8 ARITHMETIC AND ASTRONOMY
m: “Feuer, Licht, im Sinne des jaw. ‘finsteren’ hvarnah der
druj.” tfwaesah is “earthquake.”
The passage ada—spaya#rahya, in ¥.30,10 opposed to the “celestial
abodes,” is repeated in frgm.Westerg.S, cf. Hertel, Venus 2of. These
late verses speak of the “month of cold,” of the “winter mahrkusa”
[month markheshvan] threatening the world and banished into the
“ahu, world, of the Dnrys,” of the star mrzu who sets out “from his
Xsa#ram” = Akk. bitu “house,” and of the triumph over the winter.
Then comes the quotation “thereupon the skando spaya#rahya comes
to pass.” The notion is plainly connected with climate, meteorology,
seasons and the rotation of the sky.
skand- is used with the prev. avi- and fra- for phalanges, buildings
and the like; upa.scindaya with frasa in Y*.io,i8 means “shatter beyond
(repair).” The noun skanda is used in the gatha with the verb bu-, in
Aw. with kar-. H. W. Bailey, “Bum-candak — Earthquake,” bsos vi,
822L, deals with the passage in the Zamaspnam .: “bum candak vaslkar
be bavet u vas averanlh be kunet, there will be many earthquakes and
will cause much destruction,” with the same verbs bu- and kar-. Cf.
candisni in S\.Gum.Vic. MP. candak, to Vskand-, is a syn. of the Gath,
noun skanda. MP. bum candak would be Aw. bumois skando; spaya
0rahya skando is an equivalent of it.
1
The Manichaean hymns, while telling the death of Mani after the
model of the Gospels of Luke and Mark, say instead of “there was dark
ness over the whole earth”: qdg ’sm’ng ’mbst ’v byh ’rg zmyg vlvry’d,
“the house of heaven collapsed completely, the earth shook.” The words
’v byh ’rg are written ‘l lbr’ sjr’ in the Pahl. text of Hajjiabad, Pars,
byryny, where they mean “beyond (the target).” Here they mean
“beyond (repair),” as frasa upascindayati in Y/. 10, 18,
2 “beyond all
measure.” The figure of the collapse of the sky must have been so
familiar that the authors preferred it to the darkening.
spytrhy counts for four syllables in the gatha, hence spaya
0rahya, or, in analogy to dena, *spe#rahya. The Pahl. transl. has
1 tfsvesah in Yr. 11,4 maso apo maso va Swcso and similarly in 11,5, is another word for “earthquake, creujfxoi" by etymology, not “Furcht” ( Wb.) Skr.transl. renders skando :candak by canca, cancalata, cf. Arab, zalzala. - Cf. frasa upavati in the Satasesa verses Yf.S,33 under ‘Tistriya.’

spys, i.e. spehr [not spah, Wb.1613]. Spaya#ra is TPahl. ‘spyhr,
in BPars. normally spelt sp’hl for spyhl.3
MP. NP. spihr has never been linked to spaya#ra. Lagarde
considered it as loan from cr^aipa;4, Spiegel as Aw. $warta
;
Noldeke : *spi#ra to V spit- “to be white.” Quite recently, Hen
ning in jras 1942, 239 reverted to Lagarde’s opinion, dating the
loan in the time when the Babylonian notion of the “sphere of
the ecliptic and the planets” was introduced in the older Iranian
conception of heavens, and regarding the -h-, in view of the
Man. Mir. spelling ‘spyr as unetymological. In his Mir.Man.i-m
‘spyr appears only in the stories of Mani’s death and of Ohr
mizd’s fight. There, Henning explained it as N.T. cnreipa,
transl. “Kriegerschar.” But in F. W. K. Muller 11,86 = Salemann
48,4, there is ‘sp(yh)r in the sense “sphere of heaven.”
Mir.Man.111,17,3: “Uzzi, who in that night was allowed to stay with
Mani, described to the whole community what he had seen ’ndr ‘spyr,”
in the place where Mani was imprisoned. 111,45,11 and 46,1: The wind
demons enclose the god like ‘spyr ‘stft, a solid ‘spyr, and the helping god
“splits, shatters” this ‘spyr. In Ayat\.Zar. §§41-42, Jamasp makes Vistasp
promise and Vistasp swears “however fatal be the truth which the sage
will announce, ne zanem, ne ozanem, nec pa sp’hr darem [cf. ’ndr
‘spyr], I shall not beat him, not kill him, not hold him in sp’hr,” which
can mean nothing but “prison.” In Arabic there is a distinction between
habs, a normal prison, and mutbaq (tabaqa iv, “to cover”) a dungeon,
often an underground vault. There was a “house of darkness, ol/co? rod
o-kotov?,” built by Xusrau II in Ctesiphon,5 as treasure house—where
the cross of Christ was deposited—but also as prison—where Xusrau
3 la Vid. 3,42 sp’s, i.e. spahr, stands for Aw. 0wasa, i.e. Owarta, Wb. “Luftraum, atmosphere.” sp renders Aw. ffw also in a$wi)a:aspikan; in rapitfwina sp or tv. s (instead of s) for -hr- as in msvk:mahrok, psvmtpahlum etc. Spiegel, with regard to this passage, believed flwasa to be spihr etymologically. This involved the equation “0warta = Russ. twerd 1 " (in nebesnaja t\v., firmament) which Salemann questioned, Mel.As.ix, 1886, 237. Tedesco informed me that Russ. twerd 1 belongs to tverdyj “fixed,” Litt. tverice “to seize, hold, enclose, fence in; to form, create.” Owarta is important for Andreas’ theory of the Aw. character s < Aram, vhr, nggw
1931, hi, which is graphically irrefutable, only, the ligature contains, it is true, initial v—cf.
the Aw. characters w<v + P, z<v + 1—but the sign is used for hr (without vowel), not for uhr. 4 Etymologically connected with Aw. skarna “round.” 5 Theophanes, Bonn, 502; cf. Chron.Pasch. Migne 1019; Ndldeke-Guidi, Syr. Chroni\; and Thron des Khosro, in Jahrb. Preuss. Kunstslg. 41, 1920, 19.

himself was imprisoned. The name describes it as an underground vault.
That is also the meaning of the Arab, term for “barrel-vault,” azadj,
from Ass. bit azakki < Sum. e.azag, “house of darkness, cellar,” see
under ‘Architecture.’ In Y.46,6 Zoroaster calls the spaya#ra of Y.30,10
“drujo he#a, prison of the Druxs” (not, Wb., “zum Verband gehorig”).
The spayaffra of the Druxs, opposed to the “abodes of heaven,” is her
underground vault, dungeon.
The meaning of spaya#ra > spihr thus being determined, its
etymology remains to be found : from a pres, stem spaya-, V spa-,
spi-. Wb.1615 unites apparently forms actually belonging to
more than one V spa- all under this root, without any etymolog
ical connection, giving it the signification “iacere, abicere” (thus
occasionally the Pahl. transl.) OP. V sa- was not yet known to
Bartholomae; Benveniste recognized “frasahiy” as s-aor. pass,
sah- of V sa-, to Aw. Y spa-, spah-, which requires a correspond
ent *sva- in OIndian. Dar.chart.Sus.: “upari imam 0ikam hadis
frasahl” means “upon this gravelling the palace was put, pro
jected, spread” or the like, a meaning which fits that of some
Aw. vocables.
Among the verbal forms: Yif.19,56 (repeated in 59 and 62)
“Frahrasya dives three times into the ocean after the hvarnah,
mayno apa.spayat vastra, naked, having ‘thrown off’ his gar
ments.” vastra to V vah- “to put on, cover, clothe”; since spayat
assumes the negative meaning “to throw off” by the prev. apa,
the simplex must be a synonym of V vah-, “to cover,” or the
like. This would also fit fra.sispimna in Y^.i7,io = 5,127 “be
decking themselves with jewels.” Yt. 10,30, see under ‘Mithra’:
“houses, nistarta.spaya niSata.brzisa, with coverings, coverlets
out-spread, with cushions laid-down.”
Closely related to spaya#ra and (nistarta)spaya is fraspat, in the
repeated formula of Yt. 15, where the royal worshippers are standing
in prayer:
zaranene pati gatou
zaranene pati fraspati
zaranene pati upa.starne
at the golden throne,
at the golden fraspat,
at the golden cushions.



ARITHMETIC AND ASTRONOMY 621
The first term, gatu, is a throne in form of an estrade, kline, Arab,
sarir. The third term, upa.starna, has been determined as “cushion, mat
tress” under ‘Hospitium.’ The second, fraspat, is NP. farasp, afrasb,
farisp, recognized by Darmesteter, to which NP. dictionaries give two
meanings: (1) a girder-beam, sah-tir, on which one puts (pusidand “to
cover, pull on”) the roof. “Beam” is the usual signification of frasp in
MP. (2) colored woven stuffs, jam, which one draws, kasidand, over
houses, walls, shops and roofs at festivals. This is still the custom and
one uses any kind of rugs and carpets for the purpose, frasp “beam”
and “cover” are the same word, ceiling and blanket, like Germ.
“Decke.” With prep, pari, ’pari.spat > MP. parisp is “wall, enclosure,
Gr. peribolos,” syn. of “vara, wall,” to V'var- “cover.” Athenaeus 12,

lp.drt.ov” is literally “jam kasidand,” both translations of fraspat, which
is not “Kissen, Pfiihl, Lat. pulvinar” (Wb.), but “tent, awning,” tent to
Lat. tendere, “to spread, span over,” the meaning of Ir. Vspa-.
Descriptions from early Muhammedan time give a clear notion. Qaz
wlnl, 'adjd’ib, 1,321: “Ibrahim b. al-Mahdi (the poet, brother of al
Ma’mun) visited al-Amin (it is a story like the “Gluck von Edenhall”)
who was sitting under a tarima, made of aloe and sandalwood and
adorned with green, gold and red silks and brocades and Sulaiman b.
al-Mansur sat with him under the qubba.” A similar description is in
the book of Esther, tarima, mod. Baghd. tarma, is an open colonnade
with awnings, loanword from MP.; “qubba” describes their form as
cupola. Similarly Burhdn i qdti describes the “tent” of the royal um
brella, catr < Ind. cchattra, as “something round like a gumbadh,”
qubba.
Kit. al-Aghani 6,187: “Husain b. al-Dahhak tells of his visiting the
vizier Hasan b. Sahl (the Barmacid): he was sitting on a sarir [gatu]
of ebony, with a qubba over it, above which was a tarima of yellow
brocade.” These are descriptions of thrones of the type pictured on
Persepolis reliefs and in Persian miniatures. On the rock-sculpture of
Ardashlr I at Naqsh i Radjab, the queen is standing under a canopy.
Hesychios calls these canopies ovpavicrKos. Plutarch, Alex. 37, tells how
Alexander, during his four months’ sojourn, in winter, at Persepolis,

sat down for the first time on the royal throne under the “uraniscus.”
fraspat in Yt. 15 is the uraniscus, the canopy, covered with brocade
and supported by four golden columns, Uranos, varuna to Vvar- “to
cover”; Yt. 13,2: “avam asmanam yo imam zam aca parica bavava yo
histati manyustato, the heaven there which is all around the earth here,
which stands built into the air”; Gr.Bdh. 221 paraphrases “asman ape.
stun pa menoke estisnih, the heaven, without columns standing in
the air.” fraspat = uraniscus, canopy, tent and spay a0ra = uranus, dome,
vault belong together. The spaya#ra of the Druys is her underground
vault; MP. ‘spyhr, ‘spyr, sp’hr are dungeon, mutbaq; NP. spihr, the
celestial vault, the canopy of heaven.
A fragment of the Had.N. (Wb. 1168 s.v. mano) speaks of “four
mana, stations, of the stars, moon, sun and the space of light that has no
beginning.” This is the Iranian concept of four spheres, later replaced
by the Babylonian “seven spheres.” Yasht 12, follows in the arrange
ment of its st.26-37 still the older tetradic system: vanant, tistriya, haf
taringa, afs-, zmas-, urvara.cidra and spantamanyava staro form the
first, the “star-sphere.” Mah gocihra is the second, the moon sphere,
MP. gocihr. The Ind.Bdh. explains this name as “the seed of the prime
val ox preserved in the moon,” and a gloss to Yt. 17,1 says: “to^mak e
gospandan mah payak estet.” Hvarxseta arvataspa designates the third,
the “sun sphere,” and anayra roca, vahistam ahum, gara.nmana is the
fourth, the “paradise sphere.”6
In an enumeration of stars in Yt.12, partly borrowed from Yt.8,12,
Tistriya and the tistriyenya, parvya and the parvyenya, haftaringa and
vanant are invoked. 7 Tistriya is Sirius in Canis Major, tistriyenya is a
6 A shorter allusion occurs in passages as late as Y.1,16. In Mat.Catr. §22, the movements of the figures on the circular chessboard are compared with the “vartisn e a^taran u girtisn e sp’hl, the turning of the constellations and the rotation of the celestial vault.” In the microcosm chapter of the Gr.Bdh. “angon cigon andar getlh . . . e starpesltak menokantaslt an spehr sa^t estet m-tak andar iv grih, just as in this world . . . that spehr, adorned with stars, timbered in heaven, has been made with three times four knots, thus the (Zoroastrian) humanity wears the belt round the middle, with three times four knots.” The belt is said to consist of 72, six times twelve threads. In astronomy the terms orbis and nodus are exchangeable; properly speaking the ecliptic and the moon’s way are the two “orbits," their intersections the nodi, Ir. grih, Arab. al-‘uqdatain. The macrocosmic responsion is not clear to me: the zodiac has 12
configurations, but not 12 knots.—For the representation of gocihr see W. Hartner, in Ars Islamica v,i 13^ 7 Geldner in Kz.25,467 and Lommel in zn,iv,5gf., discuss the meter of these “verses” which consist of nothing but the various names plus ca yazamade. Such passages would be prosaic

fem.adj. formation in plur., recalling the Arabic name “sisters of Su
hail”: Suhail is Canopus = Satavesa and his sisters are Procyon and
Sirius. Thus, the tistriyenya are probably Canis Minor with Procyon.
In upa.paryya Andreas recognized Aldebaran in Taurus, enumerated
by Birum, Chron. lip, under the name Baparv in the list of Sogdian
moon stations. The parvyenya, another fem.plur., NP. parvln, Soghd.
Khwar, parvl, are the Pleiades in the same constellation, Arab, thur
ayya.
The haftaringa are Lat. septentriones, hence Ursa Major. Hertel,
Siegesf. considers them to be the Pleiades. The haftasruvo “seven
horned,”8 invoked together with the mrzu star, would have better
claim to be the Pleiades, like the Babylonian sibitti, seven stars. Vanant,
as the last, is Wega in Lyra.
Th/. 19,42 ( cLfragm . W'.esterg. 8):

“I call here mrzu, the primeval self-created one, the greatest fighter
among the heavenly creatures; I call here the seven-horned, the radiant,
his? sons!”
Hertel postulates the nom. mrzus in 19,42, entirely possible even if
his reasons, based on erroneous notions of history of script, do not hold
good. The language is decadent and the spelling mrzu, -zvi, -zva of no
account.9 The fragm.W esterg. says: “From the Druxs the deadly win
ter comes here, then, mrzu comes here out of his domain, +xsa0rat a+
;
the annihilating mahrkus will die,” and quotation of the spaya#ra verse
y.30,10.
In mrzu.jiva, short-lived, mrzu is Gr. /3paxns, not RV. bhrgu “radi
ant,” epithet of stars, as Hertel assumes for the name of the star which
he identifies with Venus. The Pahl. transl. is missing; NP. has “gah.”
Burhan gives gah as name of Capricornus (without evidence) and of
“the star close to the northern pole,” i.e. Polaris. S. H. Taqizadeh, Gah
himari, 330L, established the right reading of the MP. terms gah and
and unmetrical even if chance would have it that they would consist of 8 syllables. Neither is it permissible to make use of these and similar passages for establishing metric rules, or to use the meter for correcting such passages. s For “horn" = “corner, point" see under ‘Krsvar.’ 9 M3 ayati mrzvl, K15 mrzva; xsatfrata ;s xsaSrat a.

mex i gah (myx not ms) for the Polar star. In Karn. the Polar star is
also called mex 1 miyan asman, which properly speaking would be the
pole itself, the zenith, while mex i azer zamig is the nadir, mex, OP.
mayuxa, is “nail, peg”; gah is also explained by Arab, “watad, pole of
a (round) tent.” Henning insists on the translation gah and considers
mrzu, since this furnishes an etymon for East Ir. mazwai, mozai “peg,
pole,” to be Polaris, an Iranian translation of Gr. polos. It may well be
that the name, and with it mrzu “dorsal spine” in Yt. 10,71, belongs to
this group.
But in frgm.Westerg.8 mrzu “comes out of his xsafham,” that is in
Babylonian astronomy “from his bitu .” H. Winckler interpreted in his
lectures the saying in Matth. 14,57 (Mar\ 6,4, ]ohn 4,44) ovk eamv rrpo
<^7jrrj9 oltl[jlos el pa) ev rfj TrarplSc avrov kcu ev rfj oIklo. avrov, “a prophet
is not without honor save in his own country and in his own house” as
“the prophet, nebo, announcer-star, is without influence when in his
own house,” it must come out. No fixed star comes out of its house,
and mrzu must be a planet, but rather Nebo-Mercury than Venus, and
the Pahl. transl. gah may be inaccurate.
The Iranians may have contributed to astrology, goetics and mantics,
but these sham sciences are not Zoroastrian; their origin and develop
ment is mainly Babylonian. In the western world magic, magus be
came the word for it, but these words came by way of Babylon during
the Achaemenian and Hellenistic periods, as the term Chaldaei, used
for astrologers in the Mediterranean world, shows. Already the book of
Daniel calls them Kasday.
The word keta > keS has so far not been linked to any Iranian or
Babylonian word. The Gr.Bdh. says in its genealogical chapter, 230:
“[frasyak e pasang u] karsavasp ke ketan xvanend u agrerat har si brat
but hend, Frahrasya, son of Pasang and Karsavazda(h) whom they
call keSan, and Ayrera^a, were three brothers, and Pasang and "Vesak
were two brothers.” The Awesta gives a certain support to a similar
genealogy, but none to describing the second as keSan.
A few more Aw. words are grouped around keta, namely kaya§a,
kaSya, kaxvarSa and kaxuzl, which the Pahl. transl. renders by one and
the same and vague expression “farrah-kastar, impairer of hvarnah.”
Evidently, without being able to determine the terms accurately, one



ARITHMETIC AND ASTRONOMY 625
saw in them something disreputable and even forbidden : the disrepute
of things of foreign origin, “three Karrira KaKurra As to the shape of
these words, it is striking that they all begin with ka-.
kayaSa and keta were both spelled kyt in the archetype, and the dif
ferent Aw. vocalization, of the fourth century a.d., is no reason to dis
criminate between them and to search an etymology for kayaSa, like
Schwyzer’s “ka + OP. VyaS-, what an (OP.) offering!” Yr.10,2:
mrncate vispam dahyaum the mi^radru^s ruins
maryo mifkadrirys the whole province, (gloss:)
ya#a satam kayaSanam like a hundred kayaSa,
avavat rtavajacit he is that deadly for the orthodox!
There is no objection to forming names of wizards with the vitupera
tive ka-. kaxuzl is evidently ka-xuzi “what a (bad) Xuzi-woman, Ela
mite,” meaning “gypsy.” In Ves 11 Ramin the nurse of Ves is a sorceress
called “Xuzani from the sahr i Xuzan, land of the Xuz.” Aw. ka.xvarSa
(only in Y.61,2, very late, gen.pl. m. and fem.) > Arm. kaxard “poi
soner, wizard” but may be connected with Aram, hartom “magician”
in Daniel.
kasday for Chaldaei in Daniel, Syr. haldaya, Arm. k‘aldeay, reflects
the changes of It > s, r before dental > s in Assyrian, and of all sibilants
before dental into 1 in Babylonian. Hiibschmann asked, Arm.Gramm.

Henning identifies the appell. keta with the name kyt' in the Karn.
Art., “erroneously interpreted as n.pr. Kaid by Firdausi.” The context
is: When Ardashlr was in doubt whether he would be able to restore
the monarchy in Eran, he sent for advice to the greatest sage of the
period, “the kyt', ket e hindukan, one of the keSan u koSagan, sages ?
and Chaldaeans of India.” The copyist and even the author may well
have taken kyt' and kyt’n for identical, but he must be a certain figure
with some historical background.

Formerly I was mistaken in connecting kyt' with Kaniska,12
on account of some Indian traditions which I have no means to
check. Cunningham, Coins of the Indo-Scythians, quotes, from
the old Muhamm. History of Elliot, 1,108, the Indian mudjmil
al-tawari}{h : “In Sind there were [at the time of Alexander]
three kings until the time of Qfnd [var.l. qyd without diacr.
dots] who conquered them all; Qfnd was not a Hindu; in the
Cacnamah he is called a Hindu. His brother Samid expelled
Mahra the Persian (a Saka) from Mansura with the help of
Hal. His successors were Rasal (son) and Ruwal and Bar
qamaris (two grandsons). The last one killed his brother and
subjected all India.” Hal is known as one of the Salivahana
dynasty in the first century a.d., and brqm’rys, read +brqm’dys,
is Vikramaditya of Ujain, of the same family, who removed the
Saka from India. Qfnd (qqyd), Qnd (qyd) is probably Qaid,
forKaid (Firdausi).
The modern Gakkar of Taxila and Mansera claim descent
from one Ked, who was no Indian, but had come, a few cen
turies after Alexander, from Taran (Turan), country of Afra
siyap. These examples, not connected with the Shahnamah, dis
prove the assumption that it was merely a mistake of Firdausi
to use Raid as n.pr.
Ya'qubI, Hist.gy, names three famous “kings” of India: (i) Fur, i.e.
Poros, the adversary of Alexander; (2) Kaihan, kyhn, a sage and physi
cian, installed as Poros’ successor by Alexander; (3) Dabsalim, for
whom Kalila u Dimma was written. Since these are figures not of
historical but of belletristic tradition, one can neglect their unreal
chronology. The name Poros can come from no other source than
Pseudo-Callisthenes, a form of the Alexander romance. Ya'qubi’s kai
han is certainly related to kyt' ( Karn .) and Kaid ( Fird.). If authentic,
the name would be old *kai#ana, and kyt' can be read kytn < *kai
0ana.
Ya‘qubi’s Dabsalim is “devasarm vuzurg sahriyar e hindukan sah”

part of the education of a young nobleman already at Ardashlr’s time,
and Masudl, murudj 1,157, says: “One relates that Ardashir b. Babak
was the first to play Nard.” Nard is abbreviation of nev-ardasir—against
Noldeke’s unnecessary scepticism—hence is called after Ardashir and
not invented, as the chess-book says, by the vizier of Xusrau I. The
chess-book as we have it transfers a story originally told of Ardashir I
to Xusrau. To emend the name of the king into Yasodharman, a con
temporary of Xusrau, as Markwart did, is therefore off the point, and
it is still farther off to continue and construe more historical connec
tions, as Tavadia does. These are no problems of history, but of widely
popular romances.
The chess-book says: “In order to test the intelligence and the wis
dom of the Iranians,” Devasarm, the emperor of India, sent a game of
chess to Xusrau, with the challenge : “Since you as king of kings claim
to be also our king of kings, your sages should be wiser than ours;
therefore, explain the sense of this game, if not, pay us tribute!” The
bearer is t’tlytvs “who was pa.vicln14 among the Indians.” At the end
of the three days’ respite, Vuzurgmihr e Boxtagan (according to the
opening sentence of his Pandnamak “hargupat sapistan e Vehandev
Xusroy darikpat, tax-collector-general, grand-eunuch of the harem of
Antiocheia-Chosroou”) stands up, having solved the problem. He beats
the Indian in the game, and Xusrau shouts enthusiastically “si bar ziva
t’tlytvs!”15 and orders to pay him 12,000 dirham, a third of the sum,
the offended Firdausi gave to the bath-attendant. Vuzurgmihr, then,
invents the nev-ardasir, Nard, a much more difficult game, described as
a circular chess-board,16 and the Indian is incapable of playing it.
Iran was threatened by the greatest danger, namely, being forced to
pay. At the moment of his tax-collector’s victory in chess, Xusrau feels
himself as conqueror of India, Iskandar i zaman, a second Alexander,
and therefore shouts “Our Aristotle, three cheers!” In his new role
he needs an Aristotle, known to him from the romance of Alexander.

texts used to be. The Arabs write rst’t’lys.
This interpretation seems to go to disaster on the fact that the In
dian player bears the same name. It cannot be his name, because that
would spoil the point of the story. The man who wrote for Devasarm
the immortal book Kalila u Dimna, was Bidpay, Skr. vidyapati, in
Y.9,27 vaiSyapati, epithet of Homa, alcohol, i.e. “master of all science,”
universal philosopher. His name remains unknown. The bearer of
the chess sent by Devasarm is the Indian “pa.vicin, selectus,” the unsur
passed champion and sage, likewise anonymous. The chess-book, in
calling him “Aristotle” replaces the original appellative “universal
philosopher” by the name embodying the notion. But in the original
story Bidpay was the bearer, and came with the chess not to Xusrau,
but to Ardashir, and the Karn.Art. calls the greatest sage of India at
Ardashir’s time keta, kyt', kytn. Bidpay, the author of Kalila and
Dimna, is the historical figure behind the legendary Kaid.
keta, kayaSa therefore must be a word fit to express the notion of
Bidpay < vidyapati and Aristotle = philosophos. There is no reason to
believe that it had, from the beginning, any vituperative connotation,
no more than deva, tkesa and others. Though the keta in Yt.8,5, like
the +ratugut, look out for Tistriya, the word does not contain the
notion of observation of stars.
A general word for philosopher occurs in Y^.i3,i6:
aham raya hvarnahaca (the fravarti) by their r. and hv.,
us na zayati vyaxano will be born the orator
vyaxmohu gdsayat.uxSo wrhose word is listened to in the assemblies
yo bavati xratu.kato who becomes a philosopher,
yo naSyaho gotamahya who comes off victoriously from the

Hertel, Siegesf. 140, discusses the verse RV. 4,4,14 “the great ones I
smash by words on behalf of my descent; that I have inherited from
my father Gotama,” and remarks: “moglicherweise ist der Gotama von
Y/.i3,i 6 der Vater des Sangers des rgvedischen Liedes, hochst wahr
scheinlich aber ein Mitglied seiner Familie.” Therewith he takes up
the old problem, discussed under different and erroneous presumptions
by Haug, Darab Sanjana, Darmesteter and Windischmann, whether



ARITHMETIC AND ASTRONOMY 629
the Gotama of Yr.13 be Buddha or not. 17 A record, preserving the name
of the adversary, but having forgotten the name of the hero, cannot
have been transmitted in Iran from rgvedic antiquity. Buddha, on
the other hand, cannot have remained unknown in Iran since north
western India belonged to the empire at his period. The language of
the verses is good, but the character of the prophecy is not archaic.
This Gotama is Buddha.
Wb. interprets ^ratu.kat wrongly as “um Weisheit angegangen”:
kat- is root-noun with -t-enlargement, active meaning, literally “philos
opher.” The disputation is between two philosophers, one of them
Buddha. A synonym is xratu.cinah “wisdom-seeching,” Pahl. transl.
Xtat kamaklh raS. kat is related to kati in Y.9,22: “yoi katayo (naska.)
frasaho ahanti, who ‘as kati’ are studying, love studying.” PkA.433
refers to OI. katay, Vka-.
Like tkesa to Vkes, keta is the noun “thinker, meditator” to

XXXV. THE SEA
ip a Gropa-xHd 9a\d<x<njs KvdaivoiTO irals tt}s a\ias Qeridos
The notion of the earth being round, pr(9wl, and encompassed by a
sea, zrayo vurukrtam, is pre-Iranian, Aryan, and apparently pre-Aryan,
since the Greek epics too figure the yaia aTreipcov surrounded by the
coKeavos. The vurukrtam is called “apo prflu.zrayo, water (forming)
wide seas” in Yt.8,2; it forms also the “two rims of the earth, uva
karana zmo” Yt. 10,95, the northern and the southern halfcircle, dasi
nam upa karanam in 10,99; 01 . daksina = Dekkan. The wKeavos is
distinct from the 6a\acrcnj evpvvopos and so is the zrayo vurukrtam
from the other “vari.”
Fz'J.19,3: “I call here AhuraMazdah, the earth, the sea vurukrtam,
the heaven, the luminiferous sphere without-beginning, and the para
dise!” The whole composition of the Rasn- or “OrdeaP’-yasht 12 is
founded on this concept. The introductory words: “I ask Thee, Ahura
Mazdah, in correct language (i.e. Awestic), answer me, Thou know
est!”—followed by eight of the worst passages of the Awesta—do not
allow a dating of the verses long before the Vidcvdad passage, which
belongs to the beginning of our era. But the single items of the list
are taken from older passages. St.9-38 are filled by an invocation of
Rasnus which can be reduced to the formula: “We call you wherever
you are!” 1 The places are A. st.9-15: the seven krsvar; B. 16-17: zrayo
vurukrtam, with the sena tree vispabis; C. 18-19: the waters of the
Ranha, the sanaka of the Ranha; 20-22: border, center, or any other
place on earth; 23-25: the encompassing mountain hara with its sum
mits hukarya and tera; D. 26-32: the sphere of the stars vanant, tistriya,
the afs-, zmas-, urvara-ci#ra and spanta.manyava stars; E. and F. 33
and 34: the spheres of moon and sun; G. 35-37: the luminiferous space
without-beginning2 and the whole paradise. In 9-24 the metrical form
can still be perceived, the rest comes mainly from Y/.8. The elements
must have been arranged into this system between the dates of Yt.8 and
12. The “four spheres” are a notion older than the “seven spheres,” see
1 Cf. the “Song of the Caravan” under ‘Post and Travels,’ where Usa is called “from the western and eastern half.” 2 Cf. Eudemus of Rhodus, in Damascius, de prim.princ.'. nay ot . . . oi fxhv tottov . . . tcaXovat to . . . T}i , u)fj.€vov e£av diaKpidfjpat. . • . <pws jccu <tkotos

THE SEA 631
under ‘Astronomy,’ but not really old; thus, the “luminiferous space
without-beginning” may be as old as them, but both are younger than
the concept of the Fravartin Yasht, where, in st.57, the “luminaries
without-beginning” conflict with the “creation of the stars.” But there
is no reason to assume that the concept of the vurukrtam in Yt.8 was
no longer that of the old-mythical passages in Y/.5, 13 and 19, where
hvarnah dwells in the vurukrtam, 99,999 fravarti guard the ocean, and
Arjataspa sacrifices at its shore.
Among the categories “seven continents, mountain encompassing the
earth, spheres of stars, moon, sun and paradise,” zrayo vurukrtam,
mentioned between the first two, can only be the outer ocean that forms
the rim of the earth, no inland lake. Only, in the oldest passages the
concept rests, as in the Greek epics, on myth and hearsay, while in
the Frahrasya legend and in Husravah’s fight (see below) people had
seen the sea, and in still younger passages it had become a general ex
perience. In Y/. 1 3,65 clouds of rain rise from the zrayo vurukrtam, in
the Tistriya yasht especially from mount Us.hindu in the Indian
Ocean. In Vid.21,4 vurukrtam is the hamjaymanam, assembling basin,
of all water.
Without the prejudice that the far northeast of Iran was the “home
of the Awesta,” the error formulated by Bartholomae in Wb. could
not have come into existence: “Welcher See (lake) urspriinglich so
genannt wurde—das Kaspische, der Aralsee ?—ist nicht mehr festzustel
len etc.” These words sanctioned the misunderstanding for a long time,
e.g. Nyberg 251: “Wir haben [i.e. Wb.] zwischen zwei Moglichkeiten
zu wahlen, entweder ist vourukasa das Kaspische Meer und Raha die
Wolga, oder vourukasa ist der Aralsee und Raha der Jaxartes.” He
then “chooses free”—Y.30,6—“between those two not even the gods
chose the right one”—Aral and Jaxartes, and makes the name migrate,
402: “Im westlichen Zoroastrismus [his term for chapters like Yt.12 and
Videvdad] wurde vourukasa das Kaspische Meer.” We have no choice
at all: zrayo vurukrtam means never anything but the ocean.
vurukrta is a descriptive name, always spelled -kasa; vuru is evpv,
kasa is krta; MP. always fraxvkrt,3 substituting the syn. frayv- for
obsolete vuru-, as in fraxvgoyut for vuru.gavyuti. The play upon words

in the Bdh. (see below) : “made so vast that . . shows that vuru.krta
was understood as “wide-made.”
The Greek okeanos, in the original conception equally a broad stream
encompassing the round earth, has the epithets j3 advppoos, evpvKoXrros,
evpvTeirqs and moreover a\\s6ppoo<;, aij/oppo s which, like TraX'ippoos is
believed to mean a closed circle and thus resembles Ir. fra.rvesya, epithet
of the circular mountain. The mere existence of such rigid epithets of
similar meaning documents the high antiquity of the notions and his
torical contact or common descent. But while Homer pictures the stars
rising from and sinking into the okeanos, for the Aryans in their pre
Iranian home-land they do this behind the high Hara, the exterior
dike, hetu, of the okeanos, on which gods abide and the vault of heaven
rests.
This last image appears in Assyrian literature in a much misjudged
geographical text attributed to Sargon sar kissati, KA V n° 92.* The pas
sages belonging to the redaction of 700 b.c. make the old king cross the
Western Sea (Mediterranean) to ana.ku(g) and kaptara. The second
island is Crete; the first therefore should be Cyprus, the “copper-island,”
but the name is “tin-island.” Akk. anaku is plumbum album and
nigrum, tin and lead, but there are no “lead-islands,” while the “tin
islands” are famous. Pliny, N.H.36,16: “Homer calls plumbum album
Kaaairepov,” and 7,56f.: “plumbum (tin) ex Cassiteride insula primus
adportavit Midacritus.”5 This figure is the Phoenician god Melcart
Hercules, a name that evokes at once the association of the “pillars of
Hercules,” Gibraltar, the Atlas mountains and Spain. The fact that the
sequence anaku-kaptara runs against the enumeration from east to
west natural to Assyrians, proves that the text is not based on any Assyr
ian experience, but on hearsay, with Phoenician sailors as the source.
Therefore, unique in the entire Assyrian literature, the “sadu sihip
same, mountain of the lying-on of heaven,” the west point of the
horizon, appears in this text: the Atlas. It is the time after Phoenician

The two main chapters, one on routes, one on distances, stem from an incomplete Assyrian original of the time of SamsiAdad I of Assur. A redactor, living at the time of Sargon II, about 700 B.c., added an introductory and a concluding passage and connected the two old fragments by a short sentence; he took the material for these additions from a version of the Sargon legend more explicit than those we know. 5 A different location m Stcphanus Byz., quoting the Bassanka of Dionysius: Kadcrlrepa* vijaos cv rw (biceavu> rjj ’IvdiKfl Trpocexv^

Simirria, the top of which supports the heaven, the root of which
reaches the center of the netherworld.”
The Greeks became a seafaring nation and the true knowledge of
the seas came to them with the epoch of their great voyages. To the
Iranians who of old had settled in Turkistan, then in Iran, it came with
the vast expansion of their empire. That is the period when the old
mythical notions were transformed into scientific theories.
The Zam yasht 19, 56-64 and 82, contains the fragment of a younger
version of the myth of ApamNapat. Husravah-Cyrus replaces the Fire
and Frahrasya the Dragon. In the fragment preserved in the Awesta,
Frahrasya dives three times in vain to catch the hvarnah in the zrayo
vurukrtam. Each dive causes an apayzara of the ocean: (1) the vari
hosravah, (2) the vari vahyazda, (3) the vari awzdanva. The idea is
that the overflowing of the ocean forms permanent seas; vari means
“gulfs,” cf. evpvKoX7ro?. The hvarnah escapes, taking refuge “avi vy’n
vita.apam, on a V. from-which-the-water-has-gone-away,” apparently a
sandbank or cape: vy’n might be “nose,” Nord. “naze.”
This legend existed in Dino’s time, middle of tire fourth century b.c.,
from whom Cicero quotes it, de divin. 1,23,46. There it is Cyrus-Hus
ravah who dreams of seeing at his feet the sun which he tries to catch
three times in vain. The interpretation that the dream presaged three
decades of reign is preposterous. The fragment of Yt. 19 and Cicero’s
tale have a common source, the great epic, which evidently told how,
after Frahrasya’s failure, Husravah dived three times, the last with
success, after the hvarnah. The first two failures would correspond to
Tistriya’s first failure, and the tripartition of the hvarnah is a feature
of the Yama myth: it leaves Yama in three parts, assuming a bird’s
shape, and Mithra, ©retona and Krsaspa each catch such a bird. Hus
ravah apparently caught the three parts of the hvarnah: three decades
of reign, 559-529 b.c.
The legend of Frahrasya-Husravah is no longer the naive myth, but
tries to explain the existence of three great seas which were thought to
be connected with the ocean around the world. Its relation to the old
myth resembles that of the thoughts of the early Ionian philosophers to



THE SEA
634
Homer’s. It is worth noting that the seas are not regarded as something
simply existing, but that came into existence, just as the mountains are
imagined to have grown into the originally flat earth out of the encom
passing Hara brzatl, later out of the uparisena > parsen. As in the
Babylonian legend of the flood, the idea is derived from observations
of nature extremely aggrandized.
From the Iranian idea of the seas as gulfs of the ocean, Eratosthenes
developed his theory (in Strabo 11,121) that the ocean sends forth into
the oikoumene four gulfs, the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, the Persian
Gulf and the Caspian Sea. Herodotus knew, 1,202, that “the Caspian
Sea is one by itself, not connected with any other one,” because the
Greeks in the colonies on the northern shore of the Pontus had told
him so, whose caravans passed north of the Caspian, as Marco Polo
did 1,700 years later with a Venetian caravan.6 But Strabo says (xi, c.
518) : “There is no common consent on the point whether one ever did
sail from the Indian Ocean to the Hyrcanian Sea; Patrocles said it was
possible.” Patrocles introduced the wrong notion because he did not
complete the exploration of the Caspian with which he was charged by
Antiochos, see under ‘Eranvez.’ Ptolemy delineated the Caspian again
as a closed sea because he knew from merchants of his time of the
overland route north of it. But Eratosthenes’ theory had a long life;
Hamdallah al-Mustaufi, at the Mongol period, speaks still of the “seven
gulfs, khalidj, of the great sea oqiyanus.”
Hosravah, the first of the Ir. names of the three gulfs, is vrddhi adj.
of husravah; vahyazda resembles the n.pr. vahyazdata; the third, awz
danva is problematic: if to Vdan- “to flow,” the name would mean
water in motion, what motion not being expressed, e.g. a sea dreaded
for currents, or a “quietly flowing stream” aKa\appeWr)<;, like the old
est Greek notion of the okeanos. Both concepts would contradict the
Iranian classification of seas and lakes as “still” waters: they do not
flow, but “stand, histanti, MP. estend” like a NP. ab i istada, “stag
num.” The all but identical varis awzdanaho in Y.42,2 does not contain
Vdan-, but Vda-, and means “water (forming) basins.”
These three names have left no traces in later language, unless there
6 Gisinger, in Pauly RE s.v. “Skclax” remarks incidentally that Scylax’s periplus might have contained, in an introduction dealing with the “Outer Ocean” a remark on the Caspian as gulf of the ocean. But Sc \ lax must ha\e known the facts as well as Herodotus.



THE SEA 635
were a connection with the three obscure names of seas in the Bun
dahishn. Three seas or gulfs in the Iranian horizon must be the Cas
pian, the Black Sea or Mediterranean, and the Persian Gulf or Indian
Ocean. The popular name of the Black Sea must have been, since the
Median epoch, a^sena “dark, black,” for Gr. afeu'o? (e.g. Apollodorus
Rhod., Argon. B 984) “inhospitable,” later euphemistically ev£elvo<;,
presupposes Med. axsena.
In the myth oceanologic things are not the field of ApamNapat, but
of Ardvi as goddess of celestial waters. Yt.5,4 (repeated in Y.65,4)
:
yozante vispe karana All the shores are tossed up
+zrayahi vurukrtahya at (of?) the sea vurukrtam,
a vispo maSyo yozati its whole mid is tossed up,
yat his awi fratacati when to them runs,
yat his awi frazgarati7 when to them rushes
ardvi sura anahita Ardvi, the strong, the immaculate,
yahe hazahram varinam which holds a thousand seas,
hazahram apayzaranam a thousand apayzara,
kascitca esam varinam each one of these seas is
caflwarsatam ayar.baranam forty days to ride
huvaspai narai baramne for a well mounted horseman.
With Bdh. and Zatsp. I take the loc. yahe in 4g as referring to vuru
krtam, not to Ardvi, and as quantitative “which holds.” The last three
verses seem to be a gloss. Even assuming only 37.5 miles per day, the
circuit would be 1,500 miles—the Bdh., see below, arrives at a much
larger number—the dimension of a sea, not of an inland lake. The
descriptive terms karana, maSya, Vyuz- are also used for battles, cf.
Yt. 10,35; 13,39, under ‘Mithra.’
apayzara is a difficult word. Wb. translates “Abfluss” of a
sea, inconceivable to me.8 In Yt.5,4 apayzara refers to the gulfs
7 In Yt. 12,24 frazgaSate; the script of the original text distinguished d and r only by a diacrit. hook; thus, the hapax frazgarati is not beyond doubt. 8 Based on the signification of prev. “apa, off,” which does not appear with 7zar- “to flow” as verb. Though the word occurs at least seven times with short a- in the Awesta, one may
consider—since the archetype did not distinguish the quantity of initial a—whether +apa.7zara
ought to be restored. Cf. the topic name apa.xslra, which is certainly not “from which milk is off,'* but ab e sir “sweet water,” hence apa*xsira; -7zarta is the second element of yax^art, Iaxartes, the first is “exa, ice.” NP. absar, “overflow of water, waterfall” < *apa.7zara.



636 THE SEA
produced by “overflow.” St.io says: “at the apayzara of each sea
Ardvl has a palace with a hundred windows, a thousand pillars,
ten thousand beams etc.” This architecture puts the verses into
the fifth century b.c. Referring to every single sea, apayzara
seems to mean “surf.” In Y*.8,3i, Tistriya makes the sea “surge
to and fro, ayzradayati viyzradayati” ; Vyzrad-, which Wb.
compares to tt
\
rjdai, is related to yzar-. In Yt. 15,27 apayzara
refers to a river: Krsaspa brings offerings upa guSam apayzaram
ranhaya. If Ir. guSa is OI. guda “bowels,” it would mean a
peculiar riverine formation (see under ‘Eranvez’), and apay
zara perhaps the area liable to inundation or reached by irri
gation; the Pahl. transl. asinjitan is also the normal word for
irrigating.
Y.8,46 speaks of srira apayzara and nimroka of the ocean, where nim
roka is the antonym. V mruc-, in Y.53,7 with paraca oraca, Pahl. transl.
andar savet be ayet, is a movement to and fro, cf. usca—ora in the
Parva legend, and MP. ul ayet frot savet, words for high and low tide
(here below). Thus, ni + Vmruc, nimroka is the down movement,
the ebb, and apayzara when applied to the sea an up movement, high
tide. Applied to rivers it is their periodical highwater, to springs their
fulness. It corresponds to 7r\rjiJ.fxvpa. In Yt. 8 high and low water are
regarded as effects of Tistriya who rules the seasons, the calendar.
Real tides cannot be observed at the Caspian or the Black Sea, but
only at the Persian Gulf. Since the verses are not older than 500 b.c.,
all the terms can apply to the tides. The remark in Yt.^,% discussed
under ‘ApamNapat,’ on the always equal quantity of water in the
seas, explained by the equal influx of celestial waters, is the beginning
of the theory of the circulation of water. Some verses on this subject
have been worked into a long incantation in Vid.21. The old fragments
are (Vid.21):
2: yayata dunma yayata
frapam niyapam upapam
3: vivaranti vivarahu
nava afs nava za nava
The fog floats, it floats
up and down over the waters.
The rain pours down,

new the plants, new the healing
herbs.

zamca avi yonamca to earth and to your course,
us.hista pari.hezahva rise, roll around,
yahya zan#aica va^saica you for whose birth and growth
yonam daSat have laid down a course!
In the last gap the text has “ahura mazda,” wrong meter, replacing a
non-Zoroastrian word, in view of “yona bagaba^ta” (e.g. yt.10,5) prob
ably “bagaho” with the verb in plural. Three stanzas in bad condition,
5, 9 and 13, follow: “rise, sun, moon, stars over the high Hara!” after
which each time the verses with pantam—yonam—afvantam of Yt. 13,
53ff. and the entire st.4 are repeated, yonam being replaced by “zam,
earth” for the sun, by “vaxsam, growth” for the moon, and by “uzlram,
rise” for the stars.
The verb yat- in st.2 means an up and down movement in
several places; in Yt.5,65, Parva legend, it means the rolling of
the ship. The other verb, hez-, is a hapax, but the prev. pari
makes the circulating movement clear. Darmesteter translated
yonam by “airway”: in it is the determined course,
the “orbit” of the stars, here the circulation of the waters. The
early Ionian philosophers, and still Plato, explained that the
sea water became heavy and salty by evaporation; and it was
only Aristotle who recognized that all evaporated water comes
back from the clouds as rain.
Vid. 5 deals explicitly with the sea. The chapter starts: “Parts of
corpses, displaced by animals, wind, and water, cause no contamina
tion ; if someone dies by drowning or burning, it is not the water or fire
that kills him, but fate, baxt.” All that in long queries and answers. “In
winter, dead bodies shall not be exposed, only after the rainy season.”
Exposition of corpses and rain evoke the association of clouds, wind
and sea, and that is the subject of §§15-21.



THE SEA
638
As we have the text, Zoroaster would ask AhuraMazdah: “Is it true
that you dismiss the water from the sea together with wind and
clouds ?” and “unto the corpse, . . . unto the place of corpses . . . , etc.”
Darmesteter remarked: Zoroaster wonders why the god does not
observe his own laws; one rivayet asks straightway why men are for
bidden to carry a corpse near water, if the god makes it rain upon the
daxma. AhuraMazdah answers in 17: “It is exactly as you, Zoroaster,
say, I am doing all this” and in 21: “with this speech the orthodox
AhuraMazdah set at ease the orthodox Zoroaster.” The compiler dis
closes his way of working plainly enough: the material was not the
subject of a dialogue between Zoroaster and the god. The redactors
only connected the old verses on sea, wind and rain with the problem
of exposing the dead.9 The verses treated self-purification of water in a
scientific way, without any religious coloring. The sentences appearing
in the dialogue in 2nd person in the question, in 1st pers. in the answer,
were originally a narrative in 3rd person. Small metrical deficiencies
are caused by the adaptation to the context of the Videvdad.

Bartholomae compared Vza(y)- with 01 . jahati “to desert, forsake,”
but was forced to twist the meaning to “dismiss” on account of the
wrong subject “AhuraMazdah.” The verb was a middle, meaning
“secedere, to separate”; it fits the verbs yat- and hez- in Vid. 21,2-4,
stanzas of the same poem. The sequence was apparently Fzi.21,4—5,16
—21,3—5,20—21,3.

To 19: yzaryzarantis means the circulating motion, histanti = estend
as auxiliary verb the continuity. The Pahl.ideogr. m’lh, Ass. milu “in
undation, highwater,” NP. purr, is the word for “flood,” ant. ebb. The
purifying movement takes place in the depth of the putikam. To the
commentary: puhl, NP. pul, from OIr. pr#a, Vpar- means “to equalize,
compensate, exchange.” apac estet, NP. baz istadan “to stand back, re
tineri and remanere”; ke.s, mnv.s, as often, for ’yk.s ku.s or ’mt.s ka.s;
tun(d) kund NP. tun u x und, tar u mar, “topsy-turvy, medley.” West’s
translation “the water stands back ‘in mist’ and the ‘blue body’ of
Satves stands back” is erroneous. The commentary says
:
“[Others say: it is from the region of Satves and Tistar (viz. instead
of Putikam) that the water comes] towards the south; an exchange is
withheld, since Satves withholds itself from the medley all around; the
Putik lies at the side of the Satves, at which side is not clear to me; the
water reaches the Satves by (action of) wind.”
The Pahl. Videvdad was probably written under Xusrau I, and the
theories expounded in the chapter on the seas in the Gr.Bdh. are of the
same character because they come from a contemporary source. Gr.Bdh.
Anklesaria 82!?., Ind.Bdh.K20, fol.ioof.:
“zreh e fra^vkirt pa kost e nemroc kanarak e alburz si-yak e en

it covers one third of this earth, so ‘wide-made, fraxv kirt’ that it can
hold a thousand seas. It is also called ( Gr.Bdh .) ’’v.yy’v.y.vl, var.l.
’’v.yb.’v.yv.l, ( Ind.Bdh .:) ’’v.yk.vl,” very ambiguous and perhaps none
of the variants correct, possibly a transliteration of Gr. okeanos.
“har var-e rad ap.xan-e hast ke ap patis apar ayet andar e var recet

from which the water gushes and discharges into the sea; {a) (each)
spring of each sea is according to its width and breadth; (or b) each sea
has a spring, there are great, small and middle ones.”
The early Ionians and even Plato believed likewise in springs and
subterranean connection of all seas and waters: the rivers flow back
from the sea to their springs, losing the salt on the way. Aristotle first
denied springs of seas and stagnant lakes.
“ka huvasp mard tacenet {Ind.Bdh.: ka mard-e apak asp) pa cihii

1900) frasang e mas, when a well-mounted man canters he [or: a man
on horseback] needs forty days and nights to ride all around it,
namely 1800 (1900) great parasangs.”
Forty itself means “infinite,” but the calculation is: 40 nychthemera =
960 hours at 1 double parasang= 1920. The passage translates and in
terprets Yt.5,4. The day’s marches are taken as 24 hours in order to reach
1900—equivalent to about 6500 miles—another expression of “infinite,”
cf. the 900 and 1000 missiles on Ardvi’s chariot in Yt.5,120.
Then follows the description of the mythical engineering work dis
cussed here under ‘ApamNapat,’ after which the Bdh. deals with the
seas on earth
:
{Gr.Bdh.:) “zreh e svl si matakvar hast evak IHtW

putik, 2. the kmlvt, 3. X.” (both:) of these three the putik is the largest,
in which there is high tide and ebb.



THE SEA 641
svl—cf. below “nar stafrlh u surih u napakih, all solid substance,
saltiness and impurities”—must mean salt, but I do not know the
word unless it be surah “saltpetre,” cf. darya i sur as name of the Ur
miya Lake. In the Gr.Bdh. the names putik and kmlvt of the lnd.Bdh.
are omitted in the first sentence ; but upon a detailed commentary on
putik follows
:
“zreh e kmlvt pad apa^tar "pa turkistan vitiret (Ind. : pa taparistan
vitarend) ; an e _ji! tw (Ind. ) hrom, the
sea kmlvt is the one in the north; it passes (vitiret) to Turkistan
(vitarend: one crosses it to Tabaristan); X (is the sea of) Hrom,
Byzantium.”
The verb vitarend, ideogr. ‘brvn, is better than vitiret, but Turkistan
is better than Tabaristan, because, coming from Iran, one need not
cross the water to reach Tabaristan. I know of no name similar to kmlvt
for the Caspian and yet it is difficult not to identify them. The sea of
Hrom would be the Black Sea. 10 The names might refer to the Black
Sea and the Mediterranean, but at all events both are northern seas.
The description of the Putik goes on: “hamkostak e zreh fraxvkirt
6 zreh fraxvkirt patvast estet; miyan e zreh e fraxvkirt ud an [e]
putik pahluk(asr) zreh-e daret ke var e satves xvanend, having one
side in common with the sea Fraxvkirt, it is bound together with the
Fraxvkirt; between the seas Fraxvkirt and Putik, at (its?) side, there
is a sea called var e Satves.” Zatsparm says: “Satves is a gulf (side = bay,
arm) of the Fraxvkirt.”
“har stafrlh u surih u (Gr.Bdh.) na.pakih (bid.: gandakih) ac zreh

Ardvisur, but the other stuff flows back to the Putik.”

as the northern region is under the protection of Haftrang (septen

‘down-lord.’ When the ‘up-lord’ blows, high-tide (purr) results, when
the ‘down-lord,’ ebb. In the other seas, since the revolution of the moon
has no power over them, there is no high tide and ebb.”
In Vid.5,19 the ideogr. m’lh, NP. purr (both “fullness”) render Aw.
yzaryzarant; m’lh belongs to Akk. malu “to inundate, submerge,” 12
noun milu “highwater, overflow,” and purr is the NP. word for high
tide. The antonym ’vg’l hence must be ebb tide. It appears again in an
unclear passage of Men.Xr. (Andreas p-47f.) : “hamogen ap e andar

the Putik back to the sea Satves.”

can be drawn from it: the ul-havand is the wind blowing from where the
sun ul ayet, the NE. monsoon, and the frot-havand the SW. monsoon.
In analogy to IPars. ’vb’m, IPahl. ’bgm < ‘awi.gama, one can posit:
’vg’l, ’/3g’l < *awi.gala to Skr. galati, 13 to flow, drip. The name of one
of the Bahrain islands, in Yaqut and the Chronicle of Arbela (Sachau),
owal, is ’vg’l, cf. “islands in the lee or the luff.”
The Bundahishn connects the phenomenon of the tides with the
moon and believes at the same time that the monsoons start from the
moon and transmit its effect to the sea. In the Mediterranean the tides
are weak and it has no monsoons, thus the Greek started from similar
notions. According to the doxographers, Aristotle taught that the tides
entered the Mediterranean from the Atlantic where wind pressure
caused them. The great navigator Pytheas of Massilia, contemporary of
Aristotle and probably a pupil of Eudoxus of Cnidus, was the first to
recognize the connection of the tides with the position of the moon in
the sky, on the basis of observations made on the Atlantic coast of Spain.
Eratosthenes saw in the tides a proof for the unity of the ocean. Seleucus
of Seleucia explained, correcting Aristotle, that the moon exercised
pressure upon the atmosphere, which participates in the rotation of the
earth, and transmitted this pressure to the sea: a precursor of the idea
of attraction. Poseidonios who learned a lot from Phoenicians, studied
the problem on the Atlantic at Gades. He established the direct con
nection between the tides and the course of the moon: its rising to the
meridian causes high tide, descending low tide; the highest floods
come at new or full moon; the augmentation therefore is caused not
by the moon alone, but by the conjunction of moon and sun. All these
facts had been discovered when the Awestic verses on the sea Putika
were embodied into the Videvdad.
Resuming the main points of the Iranian theory we may state: All
seas are connected with the ocean, the southern quarter of which
stretches to the shore of the Hara brzati, its hetu, dike, the border of
the earth. To the northern “regions,” continental masses, the southern

a small disconnected k which can be g: ’vg’l; the Ind.Bdh. usually ’v.g’.l with diacr. dots of g,
and once ’p.g’.l with p = /9, ’/Sg’l (1 = r).

“seas” are opposed. While the seas in the north have no tides, the Puti
kam has, and likewise Satavesa. The two sentences are not contradic
tory, for the two are partial names of a unit. Putikam has one side in
common with Fra^vkirt, and so has Satavesa, also called a “gulf” of
Fra^vkirt. Besides Putikam and Satavesa have a side in common. Since
Fraxvkirt extends in the south to the very rim of the earth, the two
others must be its northern parts, and the imaginary limits are:
The only point unanswered is: which of the twTo lies east, which west.
Satavesa, governed by the star Satavesa-Canopus, protector of all
southern seas, is the home of the monsoons, ul-havand and frot-havand,
which are believed to cause the tides by transmitting the power of the
moon to the waters; the tides again are believed to cooperate in the
purification of water in the seas. This last thought is expressed already
in the Awestic text of the Videvdad and with more detail in the Pahl.
translation and the Bundahishn.
The first Greek to speak of the monsoons was Nearch, Alexander’s
admiral, quoted in Arrian’s Indica 21,1. He calls them “Etesian winds,
that blow during the whole summer from the sea (Africa) against the
land, preventing navigation.” Native sailors must have known them
since the fourth millennium. In the first century a.d. the Romans were
fully informed about them and made use of them for direct navigation
between Egypt and India. Pliny N.H. vi,26, 101 and 104, says the ships
sailed when the “Hippalus” blew, in Epiphi (July), from Ocelis or
from Cana in South Arabia, and reached India (Muziris, at Pliny’s
time Barace) in 40 days. The Hippalus is the SW-monsoon [monsoon
= Arab, mausim, “season”] and comes from the “promunturium quod
aliqui Hispalum scripsere,” viz. Cape Guardafui on the Frankincense
shore; the wind is also called Gr. libanotos, cf. Hebr. Pbonah “frankin
cense.” The Hippalus is the frot-havand of the Bundahishn. 14
14 Arab, sufalat al-rih is the lee side (Ir. frot), ‘ulawat al-rih “luff'’ (Ir. ul), and it seems unavoidable to connect hispalus with Arab, names asfal, sufla , sufala, although Pliny prefers the form hip(p)alus. D'Herbelot advanced sufala “lowland or lee," sufalat al-dhahab “goldcoast," name of a place of the Zandj, as probable origin of the name Sufala for the whole coast from which the Hispalus blows. The Arab terms lead back to Ass. saru elu “upper.



THE SEA 645
Ptolemy iv,7,i2 calls ’'ImraXov ireXayo? the part of the ocean south
of the south coast of Arabia as far as ‘Uman, in the Itiner. Alex. 48 hip
palum mare. The African cape and the sea are called after the wind,
not, as the author of the Periplus Mar.Er. §67 assumed, the wind after a
captain Hippalus who remained unknown but would have been the
first to sail straight from Egypt to India. Such voyages are much older.
The Red Sea branches off from the Hippalum mare, which is the
zrayo Putikam. The eastern part of the ocean is the Satavesa, the sea
south of the south coast of Iran, and from it starts the Persian Gulf.
They are the two northern “sides, gulfs” of the Indian Ocean which is
the southern quarter of the Fra^vkirt, the zrayo vurukrtam.
Justi, probably thinking of the “stinking sea” of the Alexander
romance and other fairy tales, had derived the name putika from puyati
“to be putrid, putrescent.” Bartholomae rejected this and derived it
from *puti “purification”: “fur die awestische Theologie ist das Meer
‘das reinigende’ (Wb.g09).” What Sasanian theologians may have im
agined does not count. The concept of the Aw. text, that everything
putrid comes back purified from the putikam, is not theology, but a
scientific theory. On Perim I was told that the yearly average of sea
temperature there is above 80 3 F., fit for cleaning. MP. distinguishes
between the n.pr. putlk and the adj. putak < ‘putaka, NP. puSah “pu
trid.” This is a genuine word. I do not believe that at the same time
‘putika could have been the word for “purified.” The initial error is
that everything Awestic must be theology. Without this bias, the name
putika of the largest salt sea in the south of Iran, which had tides and
monsoons, and where water purified itself, would never have been
interpreted otherwise than “Sea of Put.” Putika is the regular adjective
of Put.
The land Pwn.t had been known to the Egyptians since the Old
Kingdom. Georg Ebers identified the name with Put of the OT., and
Brugsch Pasha and G. Schweinfurth located it in the regio cinnamomi
fera, the “Frankincense Coast” on both sides of the Gulf of Aden.
Glaser shifted it to the north, inside the strait of Bab al-Mandab
(Perim). Philological objections were raised first by P. Jensen, who, in
Asien und Europa (directed against W. M. Muller’s book of the same
northern” and Sam saplu “lower, southern direction, wind, quarter” etc. The very origin of the term is Sumerian: the Euphrates running north-south, up-down.

name) ZA. 10, 1893, called the equation pwn.t = pvt “schlechterdings
ohne Analogic,” an objection resting on the wrong premise that it
would be an Egyptian change of sound. Second: G. Posener, Premiere
domination perse en 'Egypte, 1936, 186, who writes: “l’identification
pvt = pwn.t doit etre, croyons-nous, definitivement abandonnee.” Pose
ner proves there that the name tmhw in the list of Darius’ Suez inscrip
tion is Libya,10 but there is no reason for equating tmhw with OP.
putiya, on the contrary, the mention of Put and Lub in Genesis and
Jeremiah (see below) rules it out.
Put appears twice in OP.: (1) Dar.NiR. §3, list of provinces, and
hence, as legend above the corresponding figure among the throne
bearers; this repeated on the tomb of Artaxerxes at Persepolis. The
form is OP. putiya, El. putiia(p), Akk. puta. (2) in the list Xerx.Pers.
daiv.\ OP. putaya [EL imitates p.u.t.ta.a.ia], Akk. putaia.
In both cases the name is one of a group appended to the 21 names
of satrapies. The full group in NiR. is putiya, kusiya, maciya, krka; in
Xerx.daiv. abridged: putaya, krka. The kusiya are the Nubians. The
maciya or maka are the Arabs of the “land Qadam,” Southeast Arabia;
the Akk. version is in XerxJaiv. mak, else qadu < ‘qaduwu < *qa
dumu, ethn. qadumaia, cf. Gen. 10,30 har ha.qadam, easternmost
region of South Arabia, bene Yoqtan; Gen.29,1 ’rs bny qdm (Elohist);
Skylax wrote Mykoi. The Krka are the Carians of Bannesu, the naval
station near Muhammira on the Shatt al-‘Arab. Altogether they are the
people living along the sea route which Darius had opened by build
ing the Suez canal. The Putiya are obviously the inhabitants of the
Frankincense Country, of Pwn.t. The final proof is furnished by the
Persepolis sculptures 16 where they are represented not as negroes

Nubians and Libyans were negroes—but as pure Arabs, of the very same
physical type as the Arbaya and Maciya, only distinguished by peculiari
ties of attire. They bring a chariot with two Arab horses and an ante
lope delineated like an ibex with screw-formed horns.
The linguistic problem is: Akk. puta in NiR. §3 is the form
from which OP. pudya (imitated in Elam.) is derived. Akk.
15 “Ivbia,” from lubi, not libu-, would be the right spelling. 16 The figures on the tombs and the tripylon-thrones (end of Darius’ reign) are mutilated; the others are in perfect condition: great tribute procession of the Apadana (478 b.c.) and thrones of the Hall of a Hundred Columns (Artaxerxes I, early >ears).



THE SEA 647
putaia in Xerx.daiv. may be an Aramaic form; OP. putaya (and
El.) imitate it. The official OP. name is either a loan from older
Babylonian style or a contemporary popular form introduced by
Babylonian scribes into OP. chancery. The OT. uses also the
Akk. form puta, Gen. 10,6: “Kus, Misrayim and Put, sons of
Ham.” In Gen. 10,13 LVD must be emended in "lvb, Libyan, son
of Misrayim, see Stade, De populo Javan, Giessen, 1880,5. The
same emendation in /er.46,9, prophecy of conquest of Egypt by
Nebuchadnezzar : Kus, Put and Lub, i.e. putiya and tmhw.17 The
OP. inscriptions and the Bible use the same form of the name
in the same stylistic application, and put is a Semitic transforma
tion of Eg. pwn.t. 18
The Awesta mentions the name twice: (1) in the codicil to the
memorial list of Yt. 13, among other foreigners, ’kyt pvt’n’m, akit (hya
kinthos, yaqut) of the Puta (Akk. puta), transcribed into Awestic
with 8 < t as puSa. (2) Vid. 5, 16 (18) awi zrayo putikam. These forms
follow the official OP. style. It is no contradiction that a product of
the country itself, object of commerce, the coffee-bean, is called ttovtlkov
< puntikam.
It was Darius who ordered at the very beginning of his reign the
exploration of the Indus and the Indian Ocean and the building of the
Suez Canal, a plan of almost unbelievably wide vision at that period
for a man of under 25 years of age.19 He says in the Suez inscription:
“I ordered the building of this canal from the Nile, Pirava, that flows
in Egypt, to the sea that comes from Persis; it [was built] as I had
ordered, and [ships] sailed from Egypt through this canal to Persis,
the like of which had [never been before].” The hieroglyphic version,
according to the rests on the stelae of Maskhuta and Kabret, was more
detailed : “His Majesty has ordered that a kbn.t ship sail to explore the
water . . . from Egypt, 8 itrw (over 50 miles) ... no water in . . . order
for the commander . . . sail from Egypt ... let the boats. ...” I prefer
17 Isaiah 66, 19: Tarsls, +Put (lxx: <povd) and Lud, [Tubal and Yavan], expresses, with “rhetoric paronomasy,” the general notion of distant barbarians. No inference is to be drawn from Ez. 30,5, desolation of Egypt, =/er. 46,9; Ez. 27,10, mercenaries of Tyre = /ra. 66,19; Jer. 38,5, invasion of Gog = /er. 46,9. 18 Cf. gbn.t, later kbn.t “Gubal ship,” and gubi, gubin with Gudea. Also the not identical case of Hoddu <OP. hindu in Esther 1,1 and 8,9. 19 Cf. Herodotus 11,158.



THE SEA
648
the first interpretation of Golenisheff to that of Posener. A kbn.t,
Byblos-boat, is a big seaworthy ship of the Egyptian navy, unfit for
exploring, as Posener assumes, whether there was still water in the old
canal begun by Necho. The water to be explored is the Red Sea. The
“ravitaillement des voyageurs en eau potable” refers not only to the
short distance of the canal, but to the entire voyage to Persis, which had
never been undertaken before. One ship explores, later a whole fleet
of 24 or 36 ships sailed for Persis. The town “Sb,” mentioned two, per
haps four times, therefore, is not an unknown place in the canal zone,
but Saba in South Arabia; this is also more probable than Ptolemy’s
SajSar 7roX.t? on the African coast of the Red Sea, as Brugsch proposed.
O. Schrader had advanced, in Sprachforschung und V orgeschichte
(3rd ed. 220 and 247) the theory that the Aryans, as a people without
agriculture and with an exclusive meat diet [wrong presumptions] had
recognized the importance of salt later than the more western peoples
of IE. language, who have a common word *sel; p.221 has the headline
“Unbekanntschaft mit dem Salz.” He adduced that salted food was
excepted from Old Indian sacrifices (Oldenberg, Religion des Veda,
412 2
) and that, according to Athenion (in Athenaeus 14,661) the
bowels, in Greek sacrifices, were not allowed to be salted. Finally: in
the Rgveda and the Awesta there is no word for salt. If those prohibi
tions were historically connected, the IE. speaking people must have
known salt; if not, they cannot predicate anything. The absence of the
word in the Awesta had a certain significance as long as one believed
in a mythic-mystical “Awesta-folk” in faraway antiquity and an un
known land. But this country was Iran, and it took a full millennium
to create the Awesta. The absence of the word would be no more than
an especially improbable chance: the word for “bread,” too, had not
been recognized, yet nobody ever said that bread was unknown to the
“Awesta-people.”
A third of the country consists of salt; the whole central kaver is
salt. There are more regions without water than without salt. Tiglath
Pileser III mentions more than once the “house” or the “desert of salt,”
bit, ser tabti, which his troops reached near Bustis, Agazi, Ambanda
and the Ru’a mountains, between Kura and Isfahan. Esarhaddon speaks
of the northern end of the kaver in his description of Patus’arra at the



THE SEA 649
foot of mount Bikni, Demawand. Beside the salt desert there are salt
mountains, of which Onesicritus wrote, in Strabo c.726. All agricul
ture in Iran is a fight with the salt. All Iranian lakes are salty, in various
degrees; one of the saltiest is the Urmiya Lake, Cecista, or darya i sur,
of which it is said that no fish can live in it. The strange notions of the
“purification” of water mean above all the reduction of the salt. It is
pathetic to read what the Bundahishn writes about the holy lake Kan
savya, the Hamun in SIstan: essentially it is sweet, “When the fraskirt
comes, its water will again be sweet.”
The problem is the interpretation of the words written uruyapa and
urvapa, epithets of lakes and seas:
Yt.8,46, Tistriya descends into the ocean
zrayaho vurukrtahya jafrahya ruviyapahya
the wide-made, deep with — water
Yaio,i 4, Mithra looks over arya.sayanam
yahmiya jafra varayo ruva.apaho histante
where deep lakes with water are lying
Yt.5,49: Husravah brings offerings
pasne varois cecistahya jafrahya ruva.apahya
on the lake Cecista, the deep, with — water.
Bartholomae interpreted uru- as a form of composition of vuru- and
uruya to 01. uruya as uru to vuru, believing in the authenticity of such
phonetic detail in the Awestic text. But the archetype can have had no
more than rv- and rvy-, and alone the fact that the “form of composi
tion” is exclusively used before -apa, contradicts his theory and shows
that those who invented the Awestic script saw in this element some
thing differing from vuru-. Darmesteter, Et.lr. 11,179, had seen that the
words must import something more characteristic than the trivial
“with wide water,” namely “with salt water,” and had put uruya, urva
to Skr. lavanam “salt.” Duchesne, Comp.av. §60 and 201, resumed this
and connected with it, in §105, the name of the mountain urunyo.vai
SimiSka, but recanted it in the postscript p.71 and joined Bailey who
connected both words with V rav- in OP. rautah “river,” Aw. urvant
“flowing,” because this interpretation had the advantage of tying up
with a root known in Iranian.



THE SEA
65O
The argument does not hold good. Proving the existence of a root
hitherto unknown can be the greater advantage in view of the scantiness
of Awestic material. The name of the sea awzdanva has been ex
plained as “containing a stream, flow of waters,” possible as to form,
but uncharacteristic and contradicting the Iranian classification of seas
under “standing, stagnant” waters, and therefore inacceptable. To ex
plain the two epithets as “flowing with water” would be equally unchar
acteristic and moreover pleonastic if applied to the “wide-made ocean,”
and contradictory in the case of stagnant lakes. Entirely correct as far
as linguistics go, the interpretation is yet wrong, and the words mean
“with salt water,” like Skr. lavanoda and Gr. daXacrcra, Akk. nar mar
ratum.
urunyo.vaiSimiSka of Y/.i9,5 is arranged in Wb. under ru-, as a com
pound of (u)runya + vaSi + mifika.20 The many variants of spelling
show how poorly the name is attested. Some inferior mss. do not have
the 8 in miSka, but all have the i. The 8 in vaiSi appears also as d,
but not as t. Thus we have a not too sure rvny v’dmy t ?k’.
The name is the only one in dual form between ten names in singular.
In the preceding paragraph, five simple names (not compounds) ap
pear in dual, and must be understood as occurring twice, not as names
of pairs of mountains. But such a long name could appear more than
once only if it had a current appellative meaning. Spellings with an
unetymological 8,t, mostly in joints of false compounds, are always
suspicious. 21 Instead of being a compound of three elements, the name
may be another type of compound, e.g. a dvandva rvnyv’ + d ?myt ?k’,
the first part of which would be Yunyavan “salty.” I should prefer to
make the cesura after rvnyv’d, or with transposition -’vd or -vd’, and
to recognize in the first part of the long name the Ir. equivalent of Skr.
lavanoda “saltwater, sea,” *runya -f-uda; with the remaining myt?k’
as an independent name.
20 runya, doubtfully compared with run\a “Gefass,” for liquids, kind of bucket, possibly “copper (vessel)”; Bartholomae notes nothing to va5i; with rm5ka he compared mita, either “pillar” or “measured”; the combination makes no sense. Duchesne saw in runya at first the stem of Skr. la\anam, with ad j. term, -ya, in va5i Aw. \a5i “course of water,” in mi5ka a mere variant spelling of *mika, with unet>m. 5; cf. Grdr. § 302 , 5 . 21 5k: In vr5ka beside vrtka “kidne>s”; a5ka beside atka “overcoat,” -5k- stands for arch,
-tk-; this can also apply to n.pr. $navi5ka < *sna\itaka. nama5ka in ^7. 14,55 see under ‘Krsvar,
vyambura.' Wb. posits “namaSka to namata Reisig, wie Ai. avatka zu avata.” The material does not allow a definite answer.



THE SEA 651
The situation is not that the absence of the word for “salt” disproves
acquaintance with salt, but that the ubiquity of salt in Iran requires
the finding of the word. In NP. “salt” is namak. This appears in the
“Vyamburadiva song” in Y/.i4,55, written namaSka for +namaka, as
will be discussed in its context under ‘Krsvar.’



XXXVI. NAVIGATION
There has been coasting on the southern seas since remote prehistoric
antiquity, and more than that: these sailors ventured out on the high
sea long before the Hellenistic or the Roman periods.
The Kavaddha Sutta, 1 a work not younger than the fifth century b.c.,
tells: “Long, long ago, sea-faring traders were wont, when they were
setting sail on an ocean voyage, to take with them a land-sighting bird.
And when the ship got out of sight of the shore, they would let the
land-sighting bird free. Such a bird would fly to the East, and to the
South, and to the West, and to the North, to the zenith, and to the
intermediate points of the compass. And if anywhere on the horizon
it caught sight of land, thither it would fly. But if no land, all round
about, were visible, it would come back to the ship.” In the sixth cen
tury a.d. Cosmas Indicopleustes speaks of such land-sighting birds, and
Chinese books of the ninth century call this custom Persian.
The release of the pigeons in the story of the Flood has the same
meaning: the ark of Noah is a ship on the high sea. Gilgamesh epic,
tabl.n: “When the seventh day was breaking, I released a pigeon, the
pigeon went off, it came back. Because there is no place to sit, it comes
back.” The second time he releases a swallow, which likewise comes
back, at the third time a raven: “it saw the falling off of the waters,
eats, burrows?, did not come back.” Even if this motif would not have
figured in the oldest versions, it would attest the custom long before
the time of Buddha and of the Awesta. The awel malahi, captain or
supercargo of the ark of Ut.Napistim, see under ‘Yama Xseta,’ is another
experience of the sailors on the Persian Gulf. On the Gulf and on the
Indian Ocean there was not only timid coasting.
A study of the “ship-building papyrus” of Elephantine 2 dated 412 b.c.
reveals much concerning the ships themselves.

“shown on the beach to the inspectors.” At the last place, I.22, li-‘enain

“such a one”; DarSus.col.j sa anaku epusu mimma sa la appitti,
“what I have done, as there was never anything ‘of the kind.’ ” 5 Hence:
“the specification of this kind, here following.”
The word for the boat, seflnta, was known from late Talm.Aram.,
it is Hebr. sefina, and passed into Arabic as safina; in NP. it is used
rarely and mostly with darya’i “sea-going ship.” In Hebrew the usual
term is oni, oniyyah “vessel, fleet”; in Aram, ilfa (also in the papyri)
from Akk. eleppu. seflnta is a special boat; in the OT. it appears only
in Jonah 1 : “Jonah fled before the Lord and wanted to go to Tarsis, and
came down to Japho, and when he found a ship, sefina, that was sailing
to Tarsis, he paid his fare to sail with them to Tarsis, away from the
Lord.”
From the description in the papyrus, the sefinta is a large sailing
vessel; for among the materials needed for its repair are many planks
of cedar and other wood up to 20 cubits long, and apparently more
than one kind of sails. So it was a sea-worthy ship like Jonah’s sefina
that sailed to Tarsis. Pliny says ISIH.6,2^-. “The ships of Ceylon have a
capacity of 3,000 amphorae [=33 tons?] and resemble the Nile-boats.”
There is no objection against her lying on the Nile at Elephantine.

from Meluhha [vaguely = Red Sea], Magan [=‘Uman] and Tilwun
[= Bahrain] anchored at the quay of Akkad [north of Babylon on the
Euphrates].”6 Not much later, at the time of Sulgi of Sumer and Ak
kad, Gudea says: “Magan, Meluhha, Gubi, Tilwun gathered wood,
ships with woods of all kinds arrived at Lagas” [on the lower Tigris]
and “halub wood from the halub-mountain was imported from Gu
bin.” 7 Gubi, Gubin, first mention of the town, is Gubal, Byblos. The
sea-faring people of the Mediterranean coast sailed round Arabia and
must have had a port on the Gulf of Suez or of ‘Aqaba as early as that.
Later, Skylax went down the Indus, Nearch and Onesicritus wrent up
the Euphrates to Babylon, the Tigris to Opis-Ctesiphon, the Eulaeus
to Susa. Letter Harper n° 83: Bel-ibni, Assyrian governor of the Sea
country (Mesan-Basra) reports to Assurbanipal, before 640 b.c., that his
great enemy, Nabubelsumate, once ally of Assurbanipal’s hostile
brother Samassumukm of Babylon, had sent his treasures to Elam and
himself had fled to Hudimeri (or Hukiweri?) on the Persian Gulf;
Belibni asks for Phoenicians to build a fleet for the pursuit of Nabubel
sumate.8
Boats are called, of old, after the place where they were originally
built, hence Sum.-Akk. ma ma.gan.na = eleppu makkamtum, ma me.
luh.ha = eleppu meluhhltum (11.RaW.46,5-7). K. Sethe9 recognized in
Eg. kbn.t (Old Kingd.) a “Gubal-ship,” confirmed by Gudea’s “boats
from Gubin.” Under the New Kingdom kpn.t means all sea-going ves
sels, e.g. in the title “chief of the kpn.t, fleet of the king”; a kbn.t ex
plores the course from the Suez Canal to Persis under Darius; under
the Ptolemies it means “man-of-war.” The original foreign type was

these boats about 580 b.c., Jeremiah a little later, at the time of
Herodotus’ story 1,163-165, of the Phoceans, to whom the king Argan
thonius (a Celtic name) gave money to fortify their home-town against
an imminent attack of the Medes under Harpagus. And not much later,
a man from Massilia-Marseilles sailed for Tartessos, whose periplus,
journal, is preserved in Avienus’ Ora maritima. Maritime traffic with
Spain, for silver, iron and, by transshipment, tin, is at least as old as
700 b.c., when the “tin-island” and the “Atlas-mountain” appear also in
the so-called “Itinerary of Sargon sar kissati” (under ‘Sea’). It is also the
time of the “thalassokrateia” of the Carians, and it may be more than a
coincidence that such opposed points as Tartessos near Gibraltar and
Bannesu-Muhammira sound as if belonging to Carian speech: names
in -assos, -essos.
Strabo 111,2,3-6 tells that the Truditanians of Tartessus built their own
boats of indigenous wood and sailed with them on the one side to His
palis-Sevilla, on the other to Dikaiarcheia = Pozzuoli. Their fleet was as
strong as the Libyan one, of Carthage. Their type of boats, imitated in
Tyrus and Sidon, was a large sailing boat which used oars only for
entering and leaving port.
One cannot help thinking that the “seflna sailing to Tarsis” was a
boat of that type, or a “boat of Spain,” and to conclude that spynt’
contained that name, Lat. Ispania, Hispania. A. S. Yahuda drew my
attention to Hebr. safan, a term of carpentry, appearing only, but at
least four times, in descriptions of Solomon’s buildings, like other terms
in these descriptions as a loanword from Phoenician. In I Kings 7,3 the
“house (= hall) 10 of the Lebanon forest,” also mentioned in Isaiah 22,8,
is “covered,” spn, with cedars; in 7 Kings 7,7 the “hall of the judgment
seat” is “panelled” with beams and panels of cedars, and in 7 Kg.6,9
the temple is “covered with beams and panels” of cedars, and in 6,14
the ceiling, covering or panelling is called sippun. To cover, panel, ceil
rooms with wood has its origin in ship-building, and Phoenician ship
building has been a dominant factor in fashioning Syrian architecture
with its flat ceilings as well as its wooden double domes, constructed
like the body of a ship with a system of ribs and fillings, e.g. the cathe
dral of Bosra, the Qubbat al-Aqsa in Jerusalem and the Qubbat al-nasr

at Damascus, until the forests of the Lebanon were finally exhausted.
Therefore, s
eflna, a normal derivative of spn, designating a ship, appar
ently means a “ship with a deck or decks,” for long sea voyages. Yet,
the case is not clear. A verb spn, for a very specific technique, occur
ring only in Phoenician, can hardly be considered as a true Semitic
word. Just such wood-panelling of walls and ceilings is called qarbasa
or qarbasa11 in Arabic, the product is qarbasiyya, certainly a loanword,
possibly from Lat. carpenta(rius) ; the noun was borrowed, the verb is
a denominative. Phoen. spn12 may likewise be a denom. from a foreign
loanword, name of the people who first made it or of the product, the
ship.
Sachau thought of etymologically connecting spynt’ and spytkn, both
appearing for the first time in the same papyrus. And it is striking that
the spytkn say “it is time to lay ‘her’ up,” not “the spynt’,” as though
they could not speak of anything else, spytkn qualifies “the carpenters,
the spytkn.” Cowley remarks: “an adjective formed from a placename.”
It is indeed a regular OP. ethnic adjective, spitaka, spetaka, cf. *putaka,
but its form is also that of a term of profession, cf. krnvaka “stone
mason.” Spita is no Sem. derivative of spn, or of seflnta, hence OP.
spitakan no loanword from a Sem. “spynt’-makers,” but it can render
a foreign ethnic through the medium of Punic and of Eg. spyn.t.
The papyrus shows the mixture of nationalities in Egypt at its time.
Miflradat (Iran.) and Psmsnyt (language?) are both krky’, no plur. of
karkh “fortress,” but of OP. krka, “Carians.” Such were Scylax of Kar
yanda and the legendary Parva, vifro navazo “the experienced captain.”
The Carian graffiti in the Nile valley are usually attributed to mer
cenaries of the two Psammetichs (633-609-588), but at Abydus, abu
Simbel and Wadi Haifa, they are rather souvenirs of Carian sailors of
the naval station at Elephantine: the papyrus does not belong to the
Jewish garrison there. The name of the chief engineer is Smslk, of the
chief of carpenters Semu b. Kanufi. Ungnad compares the first with
11 Diction.: qarbasa “to make a ceiling, decorate it with interlaced designs,” and “measure length and width of a building, make its wall parallel.” 12 Cf. Hebr. scfune (with sin, not samekh) in VMos. 33,19: Zebulun and Issachar . . . will suck sefune t'mune hoi, which means stranded goods, wrecked ships. Pr.48,7: “Thou breakest the ships of Tarsh'ish with an east wind,” also Ezech. 27,26.

Punic blslk, BaXorXX^x; the man was a Carthaginian. Semu is indif
ferent, but the name of his father is Egyptian. Beside a Persian satrap,
Carian captains, Carthaginian engineers, all in Egypt, spytkn may be
the ethnic of any people on the Mediterranean shores. Already in
640 b.c. Phoenician ship-builders worked at ports of the Persian Gulf.
Under ‘Industries’ an Awestic term is fully discussed, viz. hvspyn,

coins and on painted pottery from Spain. Scylax went as far as the
pillars of Hercules. Spain was known in Iran before 500 b.c., and no
material objection can be raised against the appearance of Spaniards
in Egypt in 412 b.c. Spytkn, spitakan can be the OP. rendering of the
name “Spanish, Spaniards.”
In the OP. inscriptions the Carians are called krka. OP. krka, Aw.
khrka, means “cock,” an onomatopoetic name, like “kikeriki.” The bird
was known in the Ancient East as early as the time of Gudea, stat.G.

But in the inscriptions the name never refers to the Carians at the SW
corner of Asia Minor, whose country belonged to the empire since
545 b-C
Arrian 111,8,5 and 11,5 records that at the battle of Gaugamela the
“exiled Carians” and the people of Sittakene fought under the same
command as the Babylonians. That implies neighborhood, as between
Babylon and Sittakene, a geographical name derived from the OP.

The same group of names is found in Isaiah 22,5$., “prophecy on the

Winckler had recognized the play upon words in st stv (cf. Ps.3,7:
“sar sabib satu ‘alai), and thereby ascertained the true reading of the
name, and had presumed the same for qr.—qrqr is indeed Arab, qar
qara, Kurd, qyrqyr, onomatop. word15 for gurgling of camels, cooing
of doves—in those regions they say kukuruku—and the “kikeriki,” cock
a-doodle-doo of the cock. The oil springs and eternal fires near Kirkuk
are called Baba Gurgur, Ptolemy’s Korkura (from Alexander’s visit
there). Cf. the Balaam-saving in .24,17: “he will crush the cor
ners? of Moab, weqarqar kol bene seth
, and all bene Sheth will cry
(crow)!” and the similar idiom of Zoroaster, Y.53,8: “zahyaca vispaho
Xrosantam upa, abandoned they all shall cry!” NP. xuros, from Vxrus-,
“cock.” The play upon words is clear.
Plutarch, Artox. 10: “The king gave the Carian who had killed Cyrus
(the Younger) a golden cock, to be worn on the lance, for the Persians
call all Carians ‘cocks’ on account of their crests,” which Strabo 14,2,27
calls one of the karika, Carian inventions. On the other hand, Aris
tophanes, aves 487, says: “The cock struts around like the great-king,
alone of all birds with the stiff kyrbasia (cockscomb and Persian tiara)
on the head.”
Thus Suti in Sittakene and Carians south of them are a standing
group, from the time of Isaiah to Alexander. The Akk. version of Xerx.
Pers.daiv. replaces OP. krka by Bannesu. This town is known from the
business documents of Murasu Sons, Nippur15 as situated on a canal

(as Tartessos), or in -nesos. It is the “Carian villages” which Alexander
visited between Susa and Sitakene. In Dar.chart.Sus. the Carians are,
together with Ionians, the crew of the navy, transporting the cedars of
the Lebanon down the Euphrates to the sea and up the Eulaeus to Susa.
The town Bannesu was their port, somewhere at the Shatt al-‘Arab.
According to Aristobulus, in Arrian 6,7, Alexander founded one Alex
andria on a lacus between the mouths of the Tigris and Eulaeus. Since
he founded towns only at places he had visited himself, the order must
have been given when he visited the Carian villages, Bannesu. The set
tlers of the new town were people from the near Durine, an old urbs
regia, i.e. /lao-tXrjiW r€ix°s> a garrison under the direct command of
the great king. Durine, hence, is Dur.Ellil of the Murasu documents,
at that time at least 400 years old. For the changed form cf. the name of
Assur, late Ass. lib.ali, libbi.ali, i.e. “city,” Hellen. Libban, Libanai or
Labana.
In the same region lay in the Middle Ages Dauraq, Dorak = Akk.
Durlakln, in so prominent a situation that Sargon II uses the name
for indicating the extreme limits of his kingdom. It is AriNiNof Nearch,
in Arrian, Ind. 2,4, and AMtiH of Herodotus 6,20, both = AriNH , Iakin
(with regular dropping of init. i-). This was a colony of exiled Mile
sians, like the Carian colony of DurEllil. These Milesians are the Yona,
whom the charter of Susa mentions in the navy together with the
Carians. Another settlement of theirs was Ionaka at the place of Bushir
and Reshahr on the Persian Gulf: not Greek trading colonies, but
Persian navy bases.
Alexander’s town was destroyed by flood and rebuilt about 165 b.c.
as Antiochia by Antiochus IV. Epiphanes, and after a second destruc
tion, in 129 b.c. by Hyspaosines-Vispauzin as Spasinou Charax. It be
came the great port for the Palmyrenean trade with India, Aram,
karkha d Meshan, Arab. Karkh Maisan. It lay opposite Basra near Muhammira.
One Carian was mentioned in the chapter ‘Memorial Document,’ viz.
the krkana hvprv’xs, who must have been the commander of the naval
base of Bannesu; he was perhaps the father of Scylax, if not Scylax
himself. Scylax, the great explorer of the Indian Ocean, was admiral
under Cambyses and Darius, and dedicated his Pertplus to Darius. His
voyages extended also over the Mediterranean, as some preserved frag

ments on Mysia, Troas, Illyria and the Pillars of Hercules show: they
suggest that he followed the European coasts.
Gisinger, in Pauly, re. s.v. “Skylax,” has recognized a number of
fragments, ascribed since antiquity to Hecataeus, as “indirect” frag
ments of Scylax’s Feriplus. And Jacoby, in re. s.v. “Hecataeus,” has
shown to what unexpected degree Herodotus depends on Hecataeus.
That means that Herodotus’ chapter on India, 111,98-116 (beside other
§§) is material of Scylax, arranged by Hecataeus, and worked over by
Herodotus.
Scylax started from Kaspapyros (thus in Stephanos’ quotation of
Hecataeus) or Kaspatyros (Herodotus’ quotation of the same source).
A
late survival of the name—though otherwise spoiled—proves the p to
be the right form: KaTTafiovpiv-r) (see below). Stephanus quotes it as
rroXi? TavSapLKTj, town of Gandara; Herodotus Ik *Ka<nraiwpov re
ttoX 105 teal rr\<s HaKTvucr)<; y-rjs, which is far from being contradictory:
the town was the capital of Gandara proper and this, like rnaKrv\.K'i),
was part of the much larger satrapy to which it gave the official name.
The problem of its situation is similar to that of Opis-Ctesiphon : at the
point where practical navigation (not navigability) started, hence close
to the junction of the Cophen (river of Peshawar) and the Swat, or of
both with the Indus.
Now the Scylax fragment in Athenaeus 11,70 says: “the country is
irrigated by springs and water-engines, brgpjoi, and on the hills xvvdpa
and other plants grow,” and “from there on high mountains extend on
both sides of the Indus River, densely covered with virgin forest, Sacrv
dypir) vkr) and with aKcivOrj Kvvdpa.” South of the range separating
Gandara from the Panjab there are no high mountains on both sides
of the Indus; this paragraph, therefore, belongs to a description of
Gandhara, near the beginning of Scylax’s Feriplus, and Kaspapyrus
must lie in the Peshawar-Attock region, not e.g. at Multan.
Another indirect fragment throws light upon the date of the voyage,
which according to Herodotus rv,44 would have been before Darius
conquered Sind, and would have lasted 30 months, both highly objec
tionable assertions. The voyage from South Arabia to Southern India,
e.g., took only 40 days.
Stephanus, Hec.frgm.1j5: “among them (m.pl.) people live on the
Indus River, the Tlmcu; a royal garrison, xeixos ^aariX-rjiov is there;

that far are the Opiai, further on is desert as far as the ’IvSot (people of
Sind).” This military castrum, dastakrtam, lay on the eastern bank, it is
Alexander’s Opiane in Stephanus’ list of Alexandrias. Since Scylax
describes from north to south, the castrum was the southern point of
the country of the Opiai. Herodotus 111,98 (source Scylax) : “That part
of India (Sind) which lies towards the rising sun, is sand,” and “East of
the Indoi (Sindhi) is desert, on account of the sand.” Also iv,4o: “as
far as Indike (Hecataeus’ term) Asia is inhabited, but beyond is desert,
towards the East. . . .” This desert is the great Thar desert, the northern
limits of which do not reach the Satlaj, southernmost river of the Pan
jab, hence the land of the Opiai was below Multan, and below the
southernmost point of the Panjab, on the united stream, with the town
as southern end, at the edge of the desert. This region belongs already to
Sind, and as Scylax found there a royal garrison, Sind was already
conquered by Darius when Scylax set forth on his exploration.
In Athenaeus, the description of the mountains on the Indus is directly
followed by one of the mountains on the Caspian Sea, the style of which
is so entirely similar that Scylax’s authorship cannot be questioned:
“Round the so-called Hyrcanian Sea high mountains rise, 8 acrea vkrj
criv, densely forested, and on those mountains Kvvapa grow.” Further:
“East of Parthava the X0pa.crp.10L live, in a country which has plains
and mountains; on the mountains are virgin forests, SevSpea aypia
aKavda Kvvapa, willows and tamarisks.” It seems that the description,
much abridged, referred in the original text to Parthava, not to the allu
vial plain of Khwarizm. The sentences are picturesque because they are
personal observations: Scylax had seen the south coast of the Caspian
with its enormous mountains and virgin forests of tropical luxuriance,
but of northern plants. And he was in Parthava—with its vast plains
between mountain ranges—in Tosa, and in the very years when Vis
taspa, as satrap, gave hospitium to Zoroaster.
kunar is a well known Persian word. The Bdh. ( Gr.Bdh . Ankles. 116;
Ind.Bdh.Christ. 119) mentions it under the category “mevak, fruit
trees.” 17 This is NP. kunar, identified with zizyphus lotus, Angl.-Ind.
lotus-plum, and described in Pers. dictionaries as “Indian bir, Arab, sidr,
17 xurmak, dates; murt, myrtles; kunar; angur or ideogr. krm’, grapes; beh or ideogr. spr/l, quinces; sep, or ideogr. tvph, apple; \atrang, citrus; anar, granates; siftalak (read -aluk), peaches; urmut, peart,; anjlr, or -jihr, figs; goc, walnuts; \atam, almonds.



NAVIGATION 663
a fruit of red color, like a grape, but larger, common in India, sweet
and delicious.” But Arab, sidr, very common in Mesopotamia and
Arabia, is an unobtrusive rhamnus tree with berries called nabq. Athe
naeus is entirely mistaken in his belief that Scylax was speaking of the
Kivapct, artichoke, which came from Morocco.
The deipnosophists, of course, think of nothing but vegetables and
fruits for their dinner, but Scylax, the admiral, of course, thought of
ship-building. Therefore his Kvvapa can neither mean kunar, whether
zizyphus or rhamnus. The former does not grow on the Alburz, and
neither could be observed from a boat in those amazing forests and
jungles. Strabo xi, c.510 (cf. 698) quotes from Eratosthenes: “in India,
too, eXarij, firs grow, and with them Alexander built his fleet.” Scylax
was as good and practical an observer as Alexander’s officers. Under his
command the Persian navy, as the charta of Susa tells, had shipped to
Susa #armis hya nocena, cedars of the fir-kind, down from Babylon,
yaka “teak” from Gandara, silver and lead from Egypt, ivory from
Nubia and Sind.
In the Bdh. the § mevak “fruit-trees” follows upon “dar u draxt,
timber-trees,” namely “sarw cypress, cinar platan, spetdar poplar, sim
sar spruce (Picca, usually translated by box, buxus).” Though Kvvapa
phonetically corresponds to MP. kunar, Scylax can only have in view a
tree typical of the great forests of the Indus and the Alburz, fit for
ship-building. Who knows the countries thinks at once of the marvelous
plane-trees, many hundreds of years old, just as Shiraz evokes the pic
ture of cypresses, Basra of date-palms. Kvvapa is cinar, platanus orien
talis. Theophrast, it is true, uses in his botanical phraseology aKavdog
for “acacia habitus” of the leaves, but with Scylax one cannot yet
expect such a scientific term. The oriental plane has a leaf with five
fingers, similar to maple, only more deeply simate, and more sharply
crenate; it resembles the Greek acanthus. The tyrant Dionysius had
acclimatized it in southern Italy, and Theophrast describes the leaf
accurately.
H. Bretzl, Botan. Forschg. d.Alexander-Zuges, chap, vi, has recog
nized the high antiquity of a remark in Theophrast iv,4,i: “Of the
other countries, only Media owns forests of firs [abies, iXarr], the ship
building timber in greatest demand]; this country seems somehow to



NAVIGATION
664
reach round and to border on the Pontus.” For later periods this is not
true. Bretzl is right in comparing Herodotus 1,110, the Harpagus story,
Median period. The locality, foot of the mountains north of Agbatana
towards the Pontus, is made clear by a passage from another source:
“for there, with the Saspeires, Media is a high mountain country, kcu
tdpcn (Ion. for vXrjcn) cruvr)pecf>ri<;, densely covered with forests; the
rest of Media is plain.” The region of the Saspeires is Armenian Sper,
Ispir, between Erzerum and Trapezunt, it is Armenia not Media. But
Darius, in Beh. §§ 24-34, treats Media and Armenia as a unit, and
resumes the record of the battles of Zuzu, Tigra, Huyava, Autiyara,
Kundurus, all situated outside Media in Armenia, in §34 with the words
“This is what has been done by me in Media.” Until he reorganized
the satrapies. Media encompassed the whole of Armenia, a remnant
of the administration of the Median empire. Herodotus iv,37 describes
the south-north line from the ’Epvdpr/ OaXdaarj to the Black Sea,
which divided Asia into West and East on Hecataeus’ map, and says:
“On it sit the Persians, Medes, Saspeires and Colchians.” Thus the
concept of Media including the Saspeires belongs to Hecataeus, and
therewith the remark about the fir forests there.
Hecataeus had no personal knowledge of India, Khwarizm, nor of
the south coast of the Caspian, and the notes about these regions are of
necessity indirect fragments of Scylax. The remark about the vegeta
tion on the mountains of the Saspeires and their extension as far as the
Pontus, which Herodotus got from Hecataeus, is however so little
Hecataean in style, that it must be another of the indirect fragments of
Scylax. That Scylax dealt with the Armenian regions—probably be
tween Troas and Hyrcania—follows from a passage in Constantine
Porphyrog. de them. 1,2: “the so-called 8ipa ’ApptviaKov does not ex
actly bear this name, for . . . Scylax of Caryanda does not call it so.”
The note is older than even Hecataeus, it goes back to the time when
Armenia was still comprised in Mada, and perhaps parts of it in Kat
patuka. This time, before Darius’ accession, therefore is the date of
Scylax’s journey in the north : Caspian Sea, Parthava and Chorasmia.
Besides his remark on the Mykoi, maciya, one short fragment of
Scylax belongs to his exploration of the sea south of Iran: “island Kvpr]
in the Persian Gulf, Trepcru<q> koXttm” It may be the island of Kharg,

The two mythical mountains, Usidam “house of Dawn” and Us.hin
dava of Yt.8,32, “opposite the Indus,” which “rises from the middle of
the Ocean,” merged into each other in the Bundahishn (see under
‘Sea’). That concept exists already in Mela, 111,7,10: “Contra Indi ostia
insulae sunt quas vocant Solis, adeo inhabitabilia . . and before him
Juba says “Insula quae Solis appellatur, eadem nympharum cubile
rubens.” Some fairy-tales retain the feature that the rock clothes itself
in clouds, cf. Pseudo-Callisthenes 11,38, 111,17. f-atcr> Sindbad the Sailor
sails to the “loadstone rock.”
Gr.Bdh.77 describes the mountain as consisting of xvanahen < Aw.
ayaho hvenahya, the material of the vault of heaven, Y/.i3,2: asmanam
...yo histate ... ayaho krpa hvenahya. In Y.32,7 hvena ayaha is one of
the ordeals, like ayaha xsusta “molten metal”; Zatsparm—cf. under ‘Last
Judgment’—gives the three kinds “fire, red-hot iron and molten metal”;
hence, hvena ayah means red-hot metal, xvan- in MP. xvanahen might
be ‘sun’ or ‘blood.’ xunahen, xurnahan serves to explain Arab, “shad
hana, haematite, bloodstone, rediron-ore,” 18 and Akk. sadanu translates
the OP. stone name axsena “without light, dark-colored.” Men.Xr. on
the other hand explains hvn’syn as “gohr e almast,” substance of steel
or of diamond. At all events, from this notion of the rediron or blood
stone rock to the loadstone rock is only one step.
Ctesias, Indica, gives two examples for magnetic power. §2: irav
rapfias, acc.pl., is a sphragis, a jewel used for seals, which attracts other
jewels; his example are jewels which by this method are rescued from
rivers. §18: 7rapr)fiov (Photius) or ttdpvfios (Apollonius), a tree in
royal gardens, without flower or fruit, but with fifteen roots as big as
an arm, a span of which, when cut off, attracts gold, silver, brass, jewels

with the only exception of amber, elektron, and a cubit of it even
more. 7rdpv/?o? resembles NP. kah.ruba “straw-attracting,” i.e. amber,
and ahan.ruba “iron-attracting,” i.e. magnet.
The legend of Parva’s voyage to mount Usidam is told in Yt.5:

He called out for Usa:
At once come to my help,

This song has found a place in the Ardvl yasht, but, like the “Song
of the Caravan” in Y/.16, it belongs to Usa-Eos, obviously so in 62g: if
the captain had dared to call Ardvi “at the Usa,” the offended goddess
would have taken the telephone out of his hand. In 5,72 an added “upa”
gives the wrong impression that the worshippers are praying “at a place
called ApamNapat” to Ardvl. Just so in 62. The verse says: “He called
out loud for Usa,” as sailors do. I remember a Rgveda verse like
“Varuna who knows the way of the birds in the air, knows also the
course of the ships; Usas may rise today who fills with courage those
who desire riches, who send their ships on the high sea.” The verses
on Ardvfs apparition, taken from 5,126, must be eliminated. Equally
obtrusive is the general mazdayasnian adaptation: the double “zam
ahuraSatam” is the same interpolation as in the ApamNapat myth
Y/.i9,48. In st.65 “avi zam” may be genuine, “to the shore, land,” origi
nally with a verb of five syllables, e.g. pati.ajasat, he came back.
Parva cannot be an enemy of ©retona, for the goddess helps him and
in the whole Awesta no god helps an enemy, ©retona’s part in the
action is the caus. us- dvanaya-, a hapax. For the sole reason that he
translated “mryahya krpa khrkasahya” by “in the shape of a vulture,”
Bartholomae gave this verb the meaning “he made fly up,” combining
it with the inchoat. pres, dvansa to a V dvan- “to fly.” dvansa, exclusively
in Videvdad, is used for the movement of the “corpse-demon,” which in
7,2 is described “like a fly.” The Pahl. transl. davaristan and OI.
A dhvan- do not support “to fly” but point towards “to run,” or the
like. Moreover, dvanaya need not belong to it : like fsanaya (see under
‘Krsvar’) it may be a verb.denom. of a noun *dvana to Vdu-, cf. “dura,
far,”19 to make depart, send out. Thus ©retona, the great sovereign of
Eran who divided the world between his three sons would have sent
out his captain on his voyage, as Scylax was sent out by Darius, or the
great discoverers by the kings of Spain and Portugal. Bartholomae’s
and Lommel’s translations make ©retona throw the experienced cap
tain into the air in the shape of a buzzard, for no reason, and only
after three full days he manages to fall down, unhurt. Lommel, Vast
37,2, calls Geldner’s interpretation (in kz 27,252, unknown to me),
“nach der es sich um ein Hinauffahren auf die hohe See und Riickkehr
19 Cf. Hertel, Siegesf. 146: “Ved. duvas: Agni der unter den deva das Vordringen bewirkt,*’ and the usual translation of duta, “messenger.”

zum Lande handelt, geistreich, aber durch keine Sagenparallele ges
tiitzt.” Neither is the captain in the air supported by any analogy.
khrkasa in 6id is “chicken-eater,” NP. kargas, vulture, c£. hen-hawk,
lammergeyer, Germ. Htihneradler. The word exceeds the verse by one
syllable and must be reduced to +krkahya: “he looked like a cock,”
with his huge Carian crest, for which the Iranians called the Carians
“cocks, krka.” The legend makes the same joke as the prophet Isaiah,
Artaxerxes II and all Persians. The Carians-Krka were the “experienced
captains,” and Parva was one of them, like Scylax and the captains of
Elephantine.
ava#a in 62 cannot mean “infolgedessen” ( b.) because no reason is
indicated; it means “thus,” and vazate, Vvah- means “he sailed,” be
cause “days and nights,” nychthemera,20 are the usual measure for
distances covered by boat. The Arabs took it over as madjra, on the
Persian Gulf, and Idris! and Abulfida estimate it at 100 miles, ava.
rvisyat is not “wiederherunterkommen” but “to veer, reverse” the boat,
ora and usca are opposed like the names of the monsoons, frot- and ul
havand, or like Gr. Kara and avd. In Greek, a boat on high sea is
fiereaipos, and so is Parva, on high sea, not in the air. In three days
and nights, 300 miles, he reaches, not the zenith, but the house of Usa,
Usidam, the east point of the horizon, of the ocean vurukrtam.
In 62 Usa is called vivaitim; Wb. reads vivitim, n.abstr. “zum Auf
leuchten” because of the gen. suraya “of the mighty one.” But this
colorless epithet exceeds the meter and is to be deleted, and the acc.
vivaitim (cf. apivaiti in Yt. 10,27 f°r +api.vati, Wb. 1408) is adj. to usa
ham, read viwatim < vibatim (cf. under ‘Tistriya’).21 The misspelling
reveals that the old word was merely a name, not conveying a meaning.
In 65, Usa catches Parva “by the arm,” not the wings of a buzzard;
bazava is instr.sg., not the dual bazuwya. The small fragment of the
legend preserved in Purs.33, calls Parva “aevo.gavo aevo.armo, one
handed, one-armed.” It goes on: “rarjham ava nayantim ++savava dat cis
aite.” This is hopelessly corrupt, but like Yt.5,63, it connects Parva with
the Ranha. Markwart believed to recognize “er erreichte die weitufrige
20 Say. ne say.: as time measure 12 long hasr, double-hours; as space measure 12 double parasangs (on land, about 85 miles). 21 The archetspe expressed the b, pronounced (3 between vowels, by b; only Aw. script distinguishes. The almost regular misspelling v for b is older than the Avv. script.

Ranha, scil. ‘Pa, Wolga.” Darmesteter read in his text aevo.savo for
-gavo; savava seems to be 'gavava, ‘gavavant “one who has both hands.”
Bartholomae’s translation “rapid (torrent)” of ava-nayantlm is only
inferred from its being the acc.fem. of an adjective to ranham. The root
seems to be V sna-, na-, Gr. via, vaco, NP. sina “to swim,” Osset, nain
“to bathe,” and the word was possibly the verb of the sentence (beside
a.ite?). I expect “with only one hand, one arm, he swam over the
Ranha, as [if he was] one with both hands.”
St.65, as it stands, makes sense, but would be improved if the goddess,
working herself, Twaxsamna, would set the ship going again, fra.
yatayat, here the motion of the boat, describes the floating of the mist
in Vid.2i,y. “rolling.” For the last lines, Usa would be the subject,
Parva the object: “she made him reach his home.” The final formula
recalls Dar.Beh. §14: “ya#a parvam.cit ava#a, just as before.”
This legend of Parva contains a reminiscence of the voyages of Scylax
of Caryanda, the krkana. Even in the connection with the Ranha there
is a grain of truth: his Periplus mentions the Chorasmioi. There seems
to have been an older myth into which his voyages merged. On the
other hand, the legend is the beginning of the tales of Sindbad the
Sailor, of Basra. Basra enters for Bannesu. Parva is the vifro navazo,
experienced captain, nava.pati, and perhaps his name too is derived
from “traveling, trading.” Sindbad is no name but a title: bad < pati.
Sind enters for nava-, maybe a boat of Sind.

To regard one’s own home as the middle of the world is natural.
Nations are as egocentric as the individual to whom the world exists
only through his senses and whom the first glimpse in the morning
convinces that he is the center of the round earth. Pascal’s thesis : “L’uni
vers est une sphere infinie dont le centre est partout, la peripherie nulle
part” is only the last mathematical expression of this primordial
thought.
The Aryans of Iran called their center of the world “hvanira#a, land
with skilfully made chariots”—etymology under ‘Architecture’—an old
expression which recalls the role of chariot making in the Veda. Hertel,
iiqf,viIj42, followed by Nyberg, set up “mit den larmenden Wagen,”
but the more noise they make, the worse they are. Y/.io, 13-15, equates
hvaniratfa with arya.sayanam, the Iranian oikoumene, and the notion
involves—as did the Greek word till Herodotus’ time—the silent op
position of uninhabitable parts. In Middle Persian, xvaniras is a rare
and erudite name only, and in Mani’s time jambudvlpa came into use,
the name the Indo-Aryans gave to their center of the world, e.g. Mir.
Man. 111,43,15 (cf. 39b) : “hft qysfr zmbvdyg, the seven climata of the
earth.”
An older form of this Indian name occurs in Y^.i4,54ff.:

That is the whole song, glued into the Vrthragna yasht by the phrase:
“Thereupon AhuraMazdah continued: Is not Vrthragna, who is
created by Ahura [i.e. himself], o you men, worth to receive offerings,
worth to be praised, and the soul of the ox, who is created by Mazdah
[again = himself] ? when now the Vyambura.diva etc.” This is “Vrth
ragna’s rehabilitation,” like that of Mithra and Tistriya, which we have
studied under ‘Return of the Gods.’ The song adds nothing to Vrth
ragna’s or the ox’s claim, and the thoughts of the singers are far away
from Vrthragna and AhuraMazdah, they are exclusively occupied with
what they see: yat, strongly demonstrative, Fr. voila!, and nuram, a
present!
The mazdayasnian introduction has caused a complete misunder
standing of the verses by European scholars. Nyberg, still following
obsolete translations, writes: “Vrthragna erfahrt schweres Unrecht von
einem Volk Vyambura . . . diese achten nicht die Seele des Stiers, ver
giessen und verspritzen sein Blut, knicken sein Ruckgrat, zerbrechen
seinen Leib, reissen die Glieder aus den Gelenken, reissen ihm die
Ohren ab und driicken ihm die Augen aus. Die Stelle ist nicht leicht
zu beurteilen,” most certainly not “am wahrscheinlichsten eine
Schlachtmethode, die den rituellen Gepflogenheiten der Mithra
Gemeinde widersprach,” because Vrthragna could only be vexed at
methods repulsive to the habits of his own “Gemeinde.” Nyberg feels
reminded, by his paraphrase, of Herodotus’ report on the Scythian way



KRSVAR
672
of sacrificing: They tether the victim, at the forelegs, throw it down
with a reata [like cowboys when branding] under prayer; then they
quickly throw a loop round its neck and tie it up with a short stick
so that the victim is strangled. “Werden wir hier nicht an die bar
barische Stierschlachtung der Vyambura erinnert?” No, even if the
translation were not wrong: the alleged Vyambura slaughter—steers
are not mentioned, the Scythians strangle, a method strictly prohibited,
e.g. in Judaism and Islam (Qur.5,4). Afshln of Usrushana, at his trial
at Samarra, is incriminated: “This man used to eat the meat of strangled
animals and would prevail on me to taste of it, because it were more
delicate than meat of slaughtered animals.” Usrushana is Khodjand,
Tashkend and UraTiibe: the Scythian method of strangling was still
practiced there in the ninth century a.d. But the Scythian—and the
Vyambura neither—did not crack the spine, break the body, tear out
the limbs etc. No Samson could have done that, and even the alleged
Vyambura barbarians wanted, under prayer, to immolate, not to spoil
the appetite of their gods.
The verses are in good condition. Why 56c is one syllable short, 56c
one too long, will become clear by future study of metrics. Only 55
d-e is spoiled by added “ya voce . . . nama, which are called . . . ,” an
obvious gloss, proving that the two cubic words are something foreign
to the redactor. Their sphere is indicated by devayazo, which is not the
normal Iran, devayasna, but an imitation of Ind. devayaj. Though their
three syllables produce regular verses with the five syllables of the
gloss, only these words are genuine, “eta, such” points to them and
accentuates the foreign character of haprsi and namaSka.
Bartholomae’s remark “namaSka, Reisig, das als Feuerungsmaterial
zu verwenden verpont war” is merely a wrong inference from this very
line, “haprsi: Weiteres unbekannt.” namaSka is not better known; both
are hapax.
The translation “Reisig” rests on no other support than its hypothet
ical identification with namato in Vid.9,46, itself doubtful: “nasus
zga#ate ya0a namato taro yar, the corpse vanishes away like the namata
in a year’s time.” What passes away in a year’s course is live vegetation,
not dead brushwood (Reisig). The thought has found incomparably
better expressions: Pr.13,15: “For man, his days are as grass, as a flower

flower of the fields, the grass withereth, the flower fadeth, surely the
people is grass!” And litas ^1,147:

Or R. M. Rilke: “Aus deinen Sinnen nimmt der Wind die Welt wie

namata > NP. namad is first “foliage” ; from its use as strewing it
got the acceptation “felt” when this material replaced foliage; Syr. na
mata, Arab, namat is “felt.” 8 < arch.T, may be etymologically legit
imate, or not (see under ‘ApamNapat’). If legitimate, “etam esmam
namatakam” may be a contemptuous word for some vegetable fuel, e.g.
namata + demin.-ka “green foliage,” for, to put green wood, xvet ezm,
on the fire, was indeed a sin. In Art.Vir.Ndm.10, the saint replies to the
accusation of Ataxs, never to have used ezm less than seven years old,
but the Fire shows him the blue water of a large basin, var, which had
exuded from the green wood of his offerings. But this does not explain
why a word so easy to understand would have been glossed “ya voce
. . . nama.”
If the 8 < t is not legitimate, since esma can be anything put on
the fire, namaSka may be incense, contemptibly called +namaka >
namak, “salt,” which includes undistinctively saltpetre, sodium, murate,
nitrate, hence may be applied to incense in powder form. The irregular
spelling would explain that—just as to haprsi—“ya voce . . . nama”
was added.
The Romans strewing salt on Carthage is a commonplace even to
day, and the symbolic act was common all over the Ancient East.
Assurbanipal strewed “salt and sahlu” over devastated Elam.1 The
Sudjln stela, Obv.17, says: “On the meadows of Arpad ‘salt and shlyn’
shall be strewn.” In Judg.9,45, Abimelech strews salt on Sichem. The
early Hittite king Anittas of Kussara brought sahlu to the ruins of
Hattusas (Boghazkoi), and a formula of that type was part of the
Hittite soldier’s oath.2 Salmanassar I, having destroyed the great sane

tuary of Arina in Cataonia, says : “kudime elisu azru, kudime I sawed
over it, earth of it I collected, and in the gate of my city of Assur I
heaped it up for days to come.”3 Akk. sahlu, loanword from Sumerian
and loaned into Hebrew, s ehallm, Aramaic tahle, means “cress”; so
does Gr. KapSa/iov < Akk. kudimeru. The unexplained “kudime,” as
syn. of sahlu, is this same kudimeru, the weed par excellence, symbol
of neglect of agriculture. But the Persians hardly used “cress” in the
same meaning, for with them it was a common food, as Xenophon
wonderingly tells, Cyrop.1,2,8 and 11.
“Weed and salt” is certainly also the meaning of haprsi and namaSka.
Soldiers are speaking and use a thing well known to them as metaphor.
namaSka does not belong to “namata, foliage, felt” ; its S is unetymolog
ical; it is “namaka > namak, salt.”
frasekam frasincanti in 54d are classed in Wb. under Vhinc-,
hek'; Grdr. §49: “Lautausgleich.” Such is e.g. OP. niyasadayam,
niyastayam, upasad etc., where sandhi s for h < s intrudes from
its position behind i into a-forms. Here it would be “confusion
of sound,” for one would have fra.hixta (right), pati.hincati
(h inst. of s), fra.sek-, fra.sinc- (s inst. of h). Since an Indian
rite is described, the words may imitate Ind. prasincati, as deva
yazo imitates Ind. devayaj. Or, they may be indecent words,
retouched and assimilated to Ir. fra.hinc-, when the song was
introduced into the yasht. The only safe inference from st.54-55
is that they describe a simple rite: some animal’s, e.g. a fowl’s,
throat is cut, blood is spattered on the altar, and “weeds and
salt,” plants and incense, different from Iranian rite, are put in
the fire.
In st.56 something is acted, not seriously done: janaho and hadaho.
Ymo,7i says: “neSa manyate )aynuva (neSa.cim ynam saSayate)
yavata . . . , he is not satisfied that he did strike (it does not appear

the result is achieved. Here, on the contrary, the effort has no effect.
The first verb means, as in OP., “to fight a battle, to shoot”; the second
must be linked to azis aspa.haSo vira.haSo in Ogm.98 : a snake biting (lit.
stinging) men and horses, cf. Y.9,11: aspa.gar nar.gar “swallowing”

them. Vhad-, see under ‘Yama xseta,’ is “to punch,” evidently so in
Mithra’s epithet astra.had and rv. astra pasusadhani, goad for punching
cattle. The two words Janaho haSaho resume the three actions of the
foregoing lines, which are known from descriptions of battles in Yt. 10
and 13. The Vyamburadiva verses are partly fashioned after the model of
verses of Y/.io which belong to the Median epoch, hence are younger,
Achaemenian. “It looks as if” shows that not a battle, but drilling prac
tice is described, a thing indispensable for people who fought in pha
langes, in “line.”
The phalanges have maSyanam and karano,4 center and wings, lit.
“ends.” handama, member, corresponds to Gr. lochos; besides we have
the terms “front” and “back.” The NP. commentary to handama raza
yanti is “ham sipar ayis,” the act (or the command) of marching
“shields together!” One sees vividly how the rasta or 0raxta rasman,
the phalanges “close ranks,” hamyanta rasman, Yr.io,8. Instead of vispa
handama razayanti—one syllable too much—the text may have had
“vi handama razayanti” (Y/.io,i4 has only razaya, Yt. 14,47 vi.razaya):
the viraza is the centurion, the commander of the handama. Bartho
lomae failed to understand this word and NP. ham sipar ayis, and
thereby the whole song, and translated “die Glieder gewaltsam verren
ken” (Wb.ijj2 and 1514). Y/.io,i4, “yahmiya sastaro ira razayante,
where the commanders make the columns take rank” shows the other
formation: ira, the troop in march order.
Vnam- is “prosterni,” Arab, sadjada; to the comp, fra.namati Wb.
assigns the signification “to flee,” but in 14,56 “niederbeugen, ein
driicken”; to vi.namahva in Vid.2,10 “ziehe dich auseinander” scil. the
earth, Yama myth, but maSyanam vi.namayanti in Yt. 13,39 <<sie tfeiben
die Mitte auseinander,” all wrong, “prstam fra.namayanti” means “they
make the back in front,” i.e. they make “face about,” 5 and maSyanam
vi.namayanti “they make ‘put in loose formation,’ take side distance,
Germ, von der Mitte aus Abstand nehmen!”
For fsanaya Bartholomae quoted in ZAirWb. (to Wb.1028) Justi’s
explanation “denom.pres. of fsana-, with fs from sp” as possible. There
with he withdrew his former translation “auseinanderrenken,” which
4 Cf. yz.10.36; 13,39; MP.NP. karan and kanar; Gr. kerata. Ass. Hebr. Arab, qarnu “horn.”
5 To take cover by lying down—assumed by Herte! for zbaramna in Vr.19.42—cannot be

again was the “semantic reason” for Hiibschmann to reject Horn’s
etymology “NP. afsandan, fasandan < *(awi)fsanaya,” which is right;
it is “fundere, dispergere,” “in loose formation,” cf. Lat. turbas hostium
fundere.
The last two verses resemble a formula all but obligatory in descrip
tions of battles, e.g. Yt. 1,27: pari usi varayaSwan. The verb is Vvar
“to cover,” not Vvar- “(per)vertere”; “to cover the ears = make deaf,”
for which Lommel adduced Ved. tamasa parivrta. Yt. 14,63: “apa gosa
tosayati, (the god) makes them deaf,” likewise “pari dema varayati,
he covers their eyes, makes them blind.” parLrvesaya “to turn all round”
means the same or “makes them squint.” More than once a third ex
pression is added: “noit paSa vidarayanti, they cannot hold their legs
straight,” cf. Yt.iopft “Mithra holds the pillars straight.” The same
idea is expressed in Homer by rd yovvara \veiv or vtto Se rpo/JL09
eWafie yvta. In Yt. 10,23 and 62, the furious Mithra deprives the ene
mies of the force of their arms, the power of their legs, the light of their
eyes, the hearing of their ears. In Y/.14, there is no god to do this; the
whole song mocks the Indian soldiers, and the last two verses are mild
curses, the verbs must be injunctives.
The complex phrase vyambura.diva martiyaka devayazo can only be
construed as “the deva-worshipping Vyambura.diva men.” martiyaka
has a deprecatory meaning as in F/^.2,5 “abarsnuva asara martiyaka,
the (monstrous or pitiful) men without neck or head”; and devayaz
imitates Ind. devayaj. Vyambura is the name, more exactly an adj.,
of the country.
vy’mbvr does not render vya-, but vi + init. aleph of the
second element, hence etymologizes, right or wrong, the name
as vi + ambu-ra. The ending -ra, see Duchesne §58, is more
common in Indian than in Iranian, cf. Maka:Makuran. In the
inscriptions of the fourth century a.d., the very time of the in
vention of the Awestic script, vy’n is written for jan, vy’k for
jak. Thus, vy’mbv- can either be OI. vyambu-, or an inverse
spelling of jambu-. Bartholomae interpreted it as “dem Wasser
feindlich,” imagining a non-existing Iranian sect. Hertel set up
eight counter arguments, all on the wrong premise that vyam
bura was an Iranian appellative, vi + ambu-ra can mean “(ris

ing) out of the water” or “between two seas.” H. W. Bailey,
Kanais^a, in jras 1942, 23, says: “Khot. dara jabvi’ dvipa: dara
‘broken,’ hence ‘section, continent’ renders dvipa, so that in this
phrase dvipa is represented three times: the continent of Jam
budvipa.” He must regard jambu as syn. of dvipa—as I assume
it to be—but does not give his reasons.
Aw. daeva, i.e. dyv, is not Aw. deva, but stands for Pali dipa, dyp,
Skr. dvipa “island” and “krsvar.” The Aw. word dvipa, badly spelled
dvaepa in Yz.5,81, seems to have been lost in MP. since neither *biw nor
*diw ever appear. Ptolemy’s Diba, Amm. Marc. Serin.diba, Cosmas’
Siel.diba < Skr. Sinhala.dvipa, Pali Sihala.dipa are all Indian.
Y/.14,54-56 is a song of Iranian soldiers mocking their Indian com
rades. It may have been sung in a garrison in Sind, like Scylax’s “royal
garrison” in the country of the Opiae. Of the same style is a remark
in Yz.14,13: “the he-camel stands there, looking up and down, vididiva,
like a sastar, an officer before his troop.” It is also the style of a soldier’s
charm in Yz. 14,37: “Wearing a wing of the varagan bird [a manifesta
tion of Vrthragna] makes totally arrow-proof, not even an ahuro sas
tranam, lord of commands, general, or a dahyupati, king of kings, can
hit him; the viraja, centurion (chief of a hundred), misses him a hun
dred times, the sharpshooter does not hit him even once, the arrow
flies beyond (the target, or ‘back’)”; cf. Yz. 10,48: under ‘Mithra’: “back
wards flies the lance Mithra’s enemy throws; however well thrown, a
wind carries it off.” There was good reason to gather the Vyambura
diva song and the soldier’s charm in the Vrthragna yasht. So much
about hvanira^a.
Just as unavoidable as the notion of the circle with the ego as center
is the notion of four chief points of the compass : the human body with
front and back, right and left produces them. The sun rises in the East,
sets in the West, reaches the point of midday in its day’s course, and
the midnight point is opposite. The four points are at the border of
the horizon, its “four corners.” The Babylonians speak of “four kibrate,”
edges, later “quarters” of the earth.

Iranian terms for polygonal and star-shaped figures are: hafta.sruvo in

qarnu is the usual word in Assyr., Hebr. and Arab., hence the “horns,”

“corner,” in ca#rugosa “four-cornered” as epithet of varuna “heaven.”
The commentary to the Videvdad is right in saying “u.s cahargosih e
ku caharsuk cahargos, cahargos because caharsuk, four-sided equals
cahargos, four-cornered.” Mat.Catr.: “Four figures (of the Nard-game)
I made corresponding to the cahar suk e gehan, the four sides of the
world, namely west, east, south and north.” 6 ca^rusuka > caharsuk,
carsu, is “quadrangulum,” ¥£.5,54: “upa dvaram +ca#rusukam apanata
mam kanhaya” where it assumes the sense “market place, bazaar” as in
Latin.
“The four-cornered Uranus” is the forerunner of the “circle with
inscribed square.” The graphic representation, circle with cross ©
gives the four-spoked wheel of the Mitannian racing-chariot of about
1500 b.c. 7 In the myth of SnaviSka, Yt. 19,43, the arrogant hero says: “I
will make the earth my wheel and heaven my chariot.” He has two
epithets, srva.zanam and (a)sanga.gavam; the second is “fore-arm of
stone”; the symmetry demands for the first +srvi.zangam “shanks of
lead,” not “zur Klasse der Gehornten gehorig.” Perhaps the wheel with
its nave round which the world turns is the origin of the omphalus idea.
In a ZW/z .-passage the temple of Shez is once called “nave of the earth.”
Yt. 19,1 describes the whole circle of the earth by two halves only:
“The Hara lies all round about the countries at sunset, frapiya and at
the morning-dawn, upa.usahvasca,” and in 16,2 Usa, the dawn of morn

the front (E) or the back-half (W) of the world; Yt. 13,3: “the heaven
of whose halves, nemanam, the two karana, i.e. beginning and end, are
never seen.” Mithra appears in Y£.io,i3 parva.nemat, coming “from the
front side” of the sun (E), and he drives in st.95 “dasinam upa kara
nam, on the right border of the earth” (S) as does the sun. .RF.5,16,4

see Hertel Siegesf. 143—“Both, the light and the dark half of the
world cannot hold thy fame!” Nema > nem “half,” hence, becomes
“quarter of the world,” similar to the double signification of arda >
alak “half” and “side, edge,” in OP. “corner.” There is a division in
South and North, and one in West and East half.
Most peoples take their bearings towards the east: they “orient”
themselves. The sun rises in front, sets in the back, south is right and
good, north is left and bad, because the left hand is bad. In Yt. 10,95 the
“right” border of the earth is the course of the sun, hence the front is
East.8 In Vid.3,42, the wind coming from the right, dasinat, South,
sweeps the atmosphere clean; and for the Indo-Aryans the southern
triangle of India is daksina, Dekkhan. And yet, the usual word for
north is “back,” pasca#ya and apaxtara, and in Yt.8,33, purva vat^m
and pasceta vazate must mean “southwind” and “to blow northwards,”
because the expressions are connected there with the visibility of the
southern stars which solely depends on latitude, not longitude, see
under ‘Tistriya.’
Neither Bartholomae’s distinction between an Awestic orientation,
face towards the south, and a Persian one, face towards the east (based
on the wrong reading parauvaiy), nor Hertel’s idea of a sequence in
turning sense instead of polar opposition can be carried through : there
is no simple formula at all. Conceptions of different periods, at the same
time popular and scientific ones, overlap each other. This is familiar to
me from the ‘Iraq: simal “left hand” is north and north wind, and
bad omen; yaman, yamin “right hand” gives the name to Yaman in
South Arabia, like Dekkhan in India. Baghdad and Mossul lie, accord
ing to our conception on a north-south line, but traveling from Bagh
dad to Mossul is gharraba “to go west,” and vice versa “sharraqa, to go
east.” And scientific Arab geography draws the maps with the South
at the top, hence West right, East left. Two factors have part in this

mixture : since the earliest Sumerian time the direction of the Euphrates,
coming down from NW to SE determined all orientation: North was
“above,” South “below.” And the Islamic qibla had the effect to gener
alize Mekka, and therewith the South as “front.”
Orientation and chronometry are twins; without hand and needle,
clock and compass are the same thing. There must be some connection
between the concepts of the four quarters, the horizon with four car
dinal points, and that of the “seven krsvar,” a horizon with six points
or sectors around a circular center. The number 4 comes from the path
of the sun; the number 6 is apparently linked with the winds. The
graphic representation of the seven krsvar is the figure of the usual
six-spoked wheel of a war-chariot.
The Iranians gave the six krsvar three pairs of names; the single
names are rigid duals, that is, their use in pairs was so inherent that
they retained the dual form even when mentioned singly. They are
no individuals but twins. That is enough to prove that they were “ohne
Zweifel” no “geographische Namen fur . . . Lander, deren urspriing
liche Lage ... in Vergessenheit geraten oder ... in My thus fibergegan
gen war.” Nyberg, 54.
The first pair is arzahi-savahi, coinciding with the two cardinal points
W
and E in the four-pointed system; but the names are not derived
from the course of the sun. 9 Vid.21,3: “An injury suffered uzerahva,
in the afternoon, is cured (by incantation) arzahva, in the evening; an
injury suffered in the evening, during the night.” uz.ayarah = “inclinato
in vesperum die” is followed by awisrufha “from visibility of stars to
midnight.” The evening twilight is hu.frasma.dati, cf. Bailey bsos vi,
1931, 505E; Bartholomae compares an isolated rza.rvesa “turn of dark
ness” in Frhg.Ev.2jb with arzah. The “turn” may be from day to night,
from night to day, or at the height of midnight. There are no other
supports for the etymology of arzah.
The other member of the dvandva, savahi, belongs to suram, from
*svar-, Lat. eras “morning,” and must be connected with the name of the
month found in the Elam, tablets of Persepolis, so.wi.wa, so.wi.wan.tas,
9 In Men.Xr. 43,11 (text under 'Sea'), the two directions are confounded, perhaps because the names were no longer practically used, or because the sequence in the dvandva goes against the normal sequence.

or so.wi.ia.was, so.wi.ia.wantas, clearly transcriptions of a nom. and
gen.10 of a -vant adjective, “rich in s.” The month falls on the weeks of
21.1—20. ii, and is followed by viyaxana “melting of snow,” cf. Yt.
13,85: “a#ro . . . viyaxanahya, of the fire, the melting one”; then the
dorava(ha)ra “where the spring overpowers (winter)”: Winterstiirme
wichen dem Wonnemond.
To the same type of name belong e.g. Demawand and Nihawand. The first < MP. dunbawandu < Aw. ‘dunmavant; Wb.
749 rejects this combination of Salemann in Grdr. 1,266, and
compares “duma, tail.” But “rich in tails” is impossible, the
mountain could only have one, and has long since stopped
smoking—admitting that the tail meant smoke. On the con
trary, it is v£(f)e\r)yepiTr]<; “cloud-gathering, cloud-capt.” Hiib
schmann, PersSt. 257, remarks: “unsicher ob ursprgl. nb oder
m.” It was surely nm, as in yunman > yam, janb and other
cases. Nihawand: as long as only Ptolemy’s Nu^avavSa was
known, one could only posit h < f, type koh < kofa. But the
Sasan. bullae from Nihawand spell nyM’vnd, with inverse m,
reflecting the Kurdish change of m > v, hence, after the type
Xusrav:Xusrah, druvaspa:Luhrasp, we have nihawand < niva
vand < *(s)ni(g)vavant, Vsneg-, “rich in snow,” 12 syn. of
vafravant. Gr. nipha- is assimilation to Gr. “fog.” Cf. also dika
yavant > Sagwand, Siwand. The type is extremely old, for it
is represented in Asia Minor by Hitt, viyanawanta, Gr. Oino
anda in Lycia, “rich in wine,” see under ‘Homa.’
Thus savahivant means “rich in east winds.” savahi means the East
as wind, not as sunrise, and the counterpole, arzahi, means equally the
West as zephyr. The words may simultaneously describe the hours of
morning and evening.
Since “orientation” was certainly not with face towards the West,
the name of the West can precede in the dvandva only on account of
the dvandva rule, formulated by Panini, but valid for all IE. languages:
the word with initial vowel precedes when the number of syllables is
10 In Iranian the names appear in the gen. only, governed by “mahva, in the month of.” 11 In the Ka‘ba inscr. of Shahpuhr I (Pahl. II. 24 and 26, Pars, omits) the first name is

equal: equis virisque, aspa vlra. In spite of arzahi-savahi, the counting
starts with savahl.
The second pair is vurubrsti-vurujrsti, Bartholomae: “barsti: lautlich
stimmt Ved. bhrstay- ‘Zacke,’ ” also for the meaning: the pair has some
thing to do with the segments of the horizon. Among the many names
of winds, Vayus-Aeolus, in Yr. 15,45—probably all of them Middle
Persian in Awestic disguise—one, ,vohvarste nqma‘ appears, either
directly for vuru.brsti, or for something similar to OI. ati.vrsti, an.a.
vrsti “excessive and insufficient rainfall.” The character of both names
is that of directions defined by winds, not derived from the four car
dinal points. Vurubrsti is a northern wind, a boreas. An idiom simil ar
to our NE, NW was also known: parva.apaxtara NE-wind, apara.
apa^tara NW.
The third pair is vidaSafsu-fradaSafsu, recognized by Bartholomae
as bad Aw. spellings for vidatfsu-fradatfsu. To vidatfsu cf. Gath, “gam
vidat vastriyo” and “vidans ^wa^saha gavoi,” with “gav, cow” for
“sheep”; hence to Vdi- “to nourish, nurse,” “making sheep thrive.”
Fradatfsu is synonym, not antonym, cf. Y.45,9: “pasus viran ahmakan
frada&u, for the thriving of our pecudes virosque.” The name of the
deity of the day’s hours, fradatfsava, is derived from fradatfsu; it pre
cedes the rapitfwina “noon,” hence “hours a.m.” fradatfsu, therefore,
belongs to the South to East, and the counting of double-hours here is
in contact with the notion of the krsvar-horizon.
All the six segments of the horizon have a “ratu, judge,” comparable
to the Indian lokapala and to the Kings of the Old Akkadian “hursani
sibitam”; the whole series is interpolated into Yt.iT,, 12%. Our pair has
the chiefs fradat.hvarnah and vidat.hvarnah. The latter is not to be
confounded with ‘vindat.hvarnah 1
' to V vid-, vind-, “to obtain,” but
is the same vidat to vi + V di, as in the name of the krsvar and e.g. in
vidat.spaSa, epithet of Mithra “provisioning the armies.” hvarnah enters
for fsu; the association is: hvarnah is good for cattle. That is its meteoro
logic side, cf. Altp.lnschr. 347 on Yr. 14,41: “Vrthragna fertilizes with
hvarnah (or: makes rain hvarnah upon) the farms for the +gosurebyo,14

as the clouds there, pregnant with rain, pour (Vvan-) rain upon the
high mountains.” Mani uses the same figure, Man.Mir.1,27: “down
from the zodiacs, the Az makes furor, voluptuousness, sinfulness rain
upon the newly created woman.” Cf. Y.6,1: “When the sun brings
warmth with its light, hundred thousands of yazata come to distribute
this hvarnah (warmth) for the increase, frada#ai, of creatures.” The
conception of the Bdh. is that rain and clouds transport the seed of
plants over the earth.
Among the pseudo-Awestic names of Vayus in YA 15,45 is also ,vin
di-xvaronb4
, i.e.
+vidat.hvarnah : the ratu of vidatfsu is a wind. The three
pairs of names of the sectors of the horizon mean wind, rain, thunder
storm, and at the same time double-hours and double-months, seasons.
The enumeration starts with the east point, savahi, and since fra
datfsu belongs to the south, the fore-noon, counts in the sense of a
clock, or the sun. Bartholomae arranged, after the Bundahishn, the
second pair both on the northern, the third on the southern side. I
prefer polar opposition of the single parts, as in the case of arzahi-savahi

The graphic representation of the seven krsvar is what we call a
compass-card, Germ. Windrose, Ind. a lotus. Homer knew one of four
points, Aristoteles one of eight. The Greek sailors and geographers de
veloped it. After a period when twelve points were used, Eratosthenes
went back to eight, and that system is represented in the “Tower of the
Winds” at Athens. The picture of the krsvar is a compass without
needle, a clock without hand.
In the Babylonian world, too, there is the notion of the four quadrants
of the horizon, kibrate irbittim or arba'i, and of seven foreign countries,
hursani sibitam, around Sumer, kibru means any border, edge;
the word cannot belong to Vkbr “to be great,” but only to a root
meaning 6pit,eiv, to which also kuburru, Akk. transl. of OP. ardastana
“frame, corner-pillar” belongs.13 kibratu alone is the “region” of coun
tries outside Babylonia. The kibrate are to Babylonia what in Arabic
the atraf, afaq or thughur are to the amsar, or in Tpahl. vymnd to mdy’,
cf. Yt. 10,104 under ‘Mithra.’ loa
The picture of the Iranian krsvar more than resembles the Babylonian
so-called “Map of the World,” 16 a tablet not older than 700 b.c., which
shows Babylonia instead of hvanira#a or Jambudvipa as inner disk,
surrounded by the “circular river” of the nar marratum, “bitter water,”
Ir. vurukrtam, and with pointed triangles outside the circle, called
“nagu, district.” Hildegard and Julius Lewy have recently treated this
map 17 and interpret the nagu as “summits of the mountain round the
ocean that encompasses the earth.” If that was right it would be the
exact counterpart to the Iranian concept of the Hara brzati as hetu
of the ocean; in the Gilgamesh epic this mountain is called Masu.
The map is damaged and does not immediately show the number of
nagu, but the text of the reverse speaks of “seven nagu” and a graphic
reconstruction of the traces preserved leads equally to seven. One diffi
15 Not yet recognized in Altp.lnschr. 76. 153 Subsequent study of the hursani sibitam, a cosmologic notion dominant in the legendary literature of the Hammurapi period, has convinced me that not only the Iranian notion is derived from it, but that the term (hafta) krsvan is Akk. hursani, assimilated to the Ir. root kars-; therefore not represented in OIndian. Skr. karsu f., “furrow” corresponds to Gr. telsos, cf. Ir. karsivant “plougher.” 16 bm. n° 92687: cT.xxn,pl.48. Cf. Sidney Smith, 'Early Hist, of Assyria 86, fig.8. F. H.

culty is not explained thereby: the words “3 beru (about a parasang
or double, as time measure ‘hour’) in between” are three times pre
served between the triangles. If every time repeated, this would give 21
beru for the complete circle whose circumference is 360° or 24 hours,
hence requires an original division by 6 or 8, not by 7. If nagu meant
an entire continent—I do not believe that the design has summits in
mind—the concept would be the same as that of the Iranian krsvar,
with the distinction that in Iran the center was counted as the seventh.
Some have translated “nagu” by “island,” without mentioning the In
dian term dvipa for krsvar. One feature unites the notions still closer:
from Lewy’s investigation follows that the origin of the number 7 is
the Babylonian notion of the “seven winds,” and they call the map
therefore a compass-card, just what the Iranian krsvar notion is.
This system, known to Zoroaster, is the beginning of science, of
cosmography, meteorology and chronometry. The six krsvar are the
points or segments of this horizon which like truth always recedes
with increasing knowledge. Therefore, the later legend describes the
krsvar as “inaccessible without divine passport”—see under ‘Post and
Travels’—and adds to them Eranvez, the counterpart—become a
myth—of earthly Eransahr-hvanirafla. The hafta krsvan later on
became the haft iqlim, by a crossing with the concept, created by
the Ionian geographers, of the klimata. When countries over sea,
like Africa, became better known, the krsvar system developed into one
of continents. In the Gr.Bdh., Ankles. 106, the various human, also half
human races, all go out from hvanira^a, and some cross the Indian
Ocean and settle in other krsvar, thus the negroes in Zang.
Zoroaster speaks of the krsvar in Y.32,3 with the words “bumya
haftafle, on this seventh of the earth,” on which one sings the great epic.
Before his time, the notion is documented in Yr. 10,13, the old song, in
which Mithra looks over arya.sayanam-hvanira#a and over the other
six krsvar. In Y/.io,i6, once more, the god drives over all krsvar, over
the whole world.
At another place, Yr.10,104, the revenger god overtakes the criminal
though he flees to the ends of the world, of which three are named:
Indus, Tigris and Iaxartes, i.e. East, West, and North. The South, the
Indian Ocean, is missing, because no criminal could flee beyond it.

Nyberg believes that the three points—one of them, the West, without
a name—circumscribe Marw as center of the world, 324: “Die krsvar
Reihe ist ins Awesta zuerst durch die Mithra-Gemeinde gelangt, wes
wegen sie vom Gebiet von Marw, dem eigentlichen xvanira#a aus orien
tiert ist.” That is “fixing le centre de la sphere infinie.”
For the people of Marw the world turned around Marw, as for every
body round his home. Le centre est partout. Kant said, “in jeder Natur
lehre [here geography] ist genau so viel Wahrheit als in ihr Mathe
matik enthalten ist.” A circle is determined by three points. Marw is
so situated that it cannot be the center of a circle to the periphery of
which Iaxartes and Indus belong. The Iranians regularly overdetermine
the circle by four points. The fourth, the South, is here absent: if Marw
was the center, the whole of Iran between Marw and the Indus would
be missing. Nyberg has no word for this vast gap, but tries to fix the
permanently variable West.
The mathematical problem is: at an unknown place a Mithra-com
munity is situated, which speaks of “West”; if one can fix “West,”
their place is determined: east of West. The direction or the wind
arzahl, to him, becomes a political country, which he discovers in Yt.
10,1, where Bartholomae had translated ,arzahe‘ by “in den Kampf”
instead of “towards the west”: “Mithra to whom the dahyupati sacrifice
before they set forth down to arzahi, against the hosts of the enemies.”
This makes the three arzah of the Wb. all one and the same: the eve
ning or west. In Y^.io,8 a plurality of dahyupati of Iranian countries
[such as Marw] march “down” against the enemy in the West. The
verses belong to the song “Mithra as Warrior,” a hymn of the Median
epoch. The non-Iranian enemy is imagined, as a matter of course, living
in the West, in Assur and Babylon, at the western frontier, the Tigris,
of Yr.10,104. There is no word alluding to Marw in the verses.
The country Caxra of the Videvdad is no support for such a theory,
321: “Leider ganz unbekannt. Im Aogmadaeca ist eine Totenliturgie
erhalten: ‘Moglich ist es dem Wege zu entrinnen, wo das mit ca^ra
versehene Feindesheer lauert; unentrinnbar ist allein der Weg des
unbarmherzigen Vayu.’ Es handelt sich hier um ein Raubervolk, das
vermutlich ein Rad oder dergleichen im oder zum Feldzeichen hatte.
Moglicherweise nannte man dies Volk einfach ‘Rad’ [Mir geht ein

MiihLrad im Kopf herum: the text has only henaya ca^ravatiya, a hos

zu betrachten, etwa vom gleichen Schlage wie die mazanischen daeva
[gods of Mazan]. Es ware dann nicht allzu weit von Raga zu suchen,
—wobei freilich sehr lastig ist etc ”
I am ready to let pass as a funeral liturgy the following sermon
preached by a P.Ch. in 1916, in honor of a pilot who died before Kut:
“Pleasant but not much glorious is death in a hospital. Less pleasant,
but more glorious is death on the field of battle. Very unpleasant, but
most glorious is death in the air!” There, the modern Tyrtaeus had to
stop. But the Ogmadeca is no liturgy. If freed, as Duchesne has started
to free it, from the lumber of later redactions it is a beautiful “song to
Vayus,” the god of death. Since it contains a few OP. words, it may
have been originally composed in Old Persian. ls Five variations express
the idea that there is no escape from death. “Even though a stream, a
dragon big as an ox, a brown bear, a highwayman, a whole hostile host,
hena caxravati, block the way,19 there is always an escape; if the in
exorable Vayus blocks the way, there is no escape.”
hena is the idea of the single highwayman in higher degree. Who
follows Bartholomae in translating caxravant by “ein Rad (als Feld
zeichen) fiihrend” ought at least to see an army of the Indian cakravarti
in this troop. But the word says only “with (many) wheels.” The
chariot is varta, its body is ra(9a, the wheels are caxra. In rarest! “war
rior on a chariot” ra#a is used as pars pro toto, in caxravant caxra.
hvani.rai9a and hvanat.caxra are synonyms, hena caxravati is a hostile
host on chariots, as hena hazahraspa in Vid. 18,31 is one “with a thou
sand horsemen.” If this caxra be a standard, the brown bear would be
the Russian, the dragon the Chinese flag. The Ogmadeca speaks of “a
whole regiment of chariots.” Arzahi is the zephyr, or the evening hour.
Neither was Caxra, the “thirteenth-best land” of the Videvdad, situated
west of the West, nor was Marw the old hvanirafla, the center of the
world, because it lay east of the West.
18 The reverse case is Dra%t Asurik. , the only poem originally in Pahlaslk, preserved in Parsik literature. 19 The text, of course, does not speak of an “unentrinnbarer, i.e. unescapable way.”

The fragments of the epic, quoted in the Awesta, reveal the picture
of the pre-Iranian world as a duab, an alluvial plain with a pair of
rivers. Such a country is a “mesopotamia,” and the fact that the Indo
Aryans developed from this original experience their later concept of
the world as a system of seven “dvlpa, islands,” Ir. krsvar, proves that
they too came from the same country. The names djazirat al-‘Arab for
Arabia proper and djazlra for Mesopotamia, show a similar notion.
The names of the two rivers are Ranha and Vahvi. Already Lagarde
and Kuhn had identified Ranha, MP. Arang, with ‘Pa, the old name of
the Wolga.1 It was rash to give up the identity of these names, and
Markwart reverted to it, on the strength of the verses Yt. 14,29, cf. Vid.
19,42:
avamca sukam (yim) barati karo masyo upa.apo
<yo) ranhaya dure.paraya jafraya (hazahra.viraya) varsa.stavaham
apo rvesam marayati
Hertel, iiqf vii, tried to scan the verses as they stand, with their
meter spoiled by accretions. In order to adapt the verses to a nonsensical
context, the original construction has been changed to “Zoroaster has
the visual power, which the fish has, which can perceive ...” The
original predication was without reference to Zoroaster: “The visual
power of the kara fish in the water is such that it can perceive a whirl,
be it as thin as a hair, over the whole width of the broad, deep Ranha.”
The depth of the river does not need a determination by “a thousand
men,” which spoils the thought and the meter : hazahravlra, the height
of the Hukarya from which Ardvl leaps down, does not belong here.
Anquetil du Perron, and following him Darmesteter, identified the
kara with the sturgeon, which later wmuld have become mythical.
Markwart called this “einen untriiglichen Beweis, dass die Ranha ur
spriinglich die Wolga meinte, die der Stor heute bevolkert” ( Wehrdt
,
188). It would be so if the equation kara = sturgeon was a fact, and if
the sturgeon lived only in the Wolga. I do not know how it is with

Amu and Syr Darya, but there is Siberian red caviar, and the great
Russian sturgeon fisheries, for caviar, are in Gilan, on the Persian coast
of the Caspian. It is wrong to identify the rivers, but their names are
the same. Just as the name Ranha was later transferred to the Araxes
in Transcaucasia, it was apparently transferred to the Wolga in high
antiquity.
When the river became known to the West through Alexander’s
campaign, the classical authors used Jaxartes, apparently a surname,
like hetumati for harahvati. The form used by Aristobulus is given in
Plutarch, Alex.45 as opefdpn}?, in Arrian as ofavT7}s, ofuapTTj? [the lat
ter assimilated to ofudprij? < uxsya.rta]. Markwart’s interpretation
+rysa.rta is neither linguistically sound, nor can it hold against the fact
that it is one of the names of the Jaxartes. The Gr.Bdh. 86f. says: “the
Xvajand river is between Sumarkand and Fargan, also called yaxsart.” 2
All forms reflect the same name, the second element of which is -yza

The name of the second stream, Vahvi, appears in Ptolemy as that of
a tributary, in Bactria, ?flxo ? (cf. the same as surname of Artaxerxes,

Yt. 10,50, imitated in 12,23, describes the Hara as Elysium:

noit oto vato noit garmo neither cold nor hot wind,
neSa dvanman uzjasati nor do mists rise

One of the highest summits of the Hara is Mt. Hukarya, from which
Ardvi leaps down, as water, Yt.^,g6, hazahra.vira. In Y^.i5,i5 the hu
karya is called vispa.bamiya “(made of) all-light,” adj. of vispa.bama,
name of the diamond. Many Iranian mountains look as if self-radiating.
In spring and autumn, the valley from Izad^vas to Pasargadae looks
like a soil of nephrite, with mountains of agate, cornelian and amethyst.
On the Hara rests the celestial vault, asman, the “stone-heaven, a
Stone Age concept, also Sumerian. Yt. 13,2 calls it “ayaho krpa hvenahya,
made of red-hot metal,” a Bronze Age notion, followed in Greece by
the ovpavos cndr/peos of the Iron Age. It is the varuna ca^rugosa, the
heaven with the four cardinal points.
At the northern point, this Cinvat bridge leads over the chasm of the
netherworld into heaven. In the Greek epics the entrance to the king

sheep are separated. In the old myth the dead go over the bridge guided
by the fair maiden; the unworthy slip off. The origin of the notion is
the iris, because the rainbow always seems to stand on the horizon
opposite to the southern path of the sun, and because it is a challenge
for mythical explanation. In Gen.9,1 iff., “My bow, qasti,” is the “token
of the covenant,” ot ha.bTlt. In Babylonia Marduk’s bow is in the sky.
I do not know how old the idea is that the bridge narrows down to the
width of a knife’s blade under a sinner, but that motif spread over the
world and survives as well in German “Marchen” as in those notions
which Goldziher called “Islamische Gottesurteile.” 5
The few mythical verses preserved do not allow a painting of the
picture in full. Besides some features which describe real geographic
peculiarities, there are others even older than the period during which
the Aryans stayed on in the Duab after the emigration of the Indo
Aryans, and which therefore have analogies in the myths of other Euro
pean peoples. At any rate, the picture has nothing in common with
that in Zam yasht 19, with its 2,244 Iranian mountains, and the exact
description of Sistan-Zranga; nor with that of the Mithra yasht 10,
with the six krsvar round the center hvanira^a-aryasayanam, bordered
in the North by the Ranha, in the East by the Indus, in the West by the
Tigris. Zoroaster shares this concept of the seven krsvar. The old picture
of the world, hence, is neither that of the Gathas nor of the Awesta,
but exclusively that of the epic. It is the pre-Iranian notion of the
original home of the Aryans which had passed entirely into myth.
Oxus and Iaxartes, like Euphrates and Tigris, have changed their
course more than once during the historical millennia. Such large rivers
in alluvial plains change continuously and keep their course only as
long as irrigation works and dams are built and kept in repair. These
works determine the hydrography of the countries. In Sistan the band i
Sistan, reason for the epithet hetumant of the haravhati, served that
purpose, in Khuzistan it was the shadhurwan of Shushtar and others;

observation (against Barthold).
Records concerning the Duab of Turkistan are so scarce in high an
tiquity that the conditions are intelligible only when traced back from
recent times. 7 Today both rivers, Amu and Syr Darya, fall into the
Aral Lake, and have done so since 1575.8 But from 1221, Mongol in
vasion, to 1575, the main branch of the Oxus discharged into the
Caspian Sea; at the bifurcation just above Gurganj, a right branch
went off to the north, to the Aral Sea, while the left and main branch9
passed to the west, south of the town, and filled the deep depression of
the Sarykamysh, about 155 miles SW from the Aral. From there it
ran through the bed—dry today—of the Uzboi southeast to the gap in

For the historic -geographical side the following treatises are the most important, where also the geologic-geographical literature, mostly in Russian, is quoted: de Goeje, Das alte Bett des Oxus, Leiden, 1875; W. Barthold, Nachrichten iiber d. Aral

the Balkhan hills (over 100 miles SE of Krasnowodsk) and discharged
into the Caspian opposite the group of islands called Oghurtcha (or
Aghyrtcha). In 1392, Zahir al-din al-Mar‘ashi, a native of Mazandaran,
describes with all detail the waterway from Mazandaran to Xwarizm;
and Shihab al-din ‘Umar al-‘UmarI, who lived in Syria and Egypt and
died about 1348, reports, on the authority of people from Khwarizm:
“On Khwarizm borders ... a country . . . Mangyshlaq, a steppe, . . .
separated from the Djaihun (Oxus) by the Ak-Balkan hills north of
Khurasan.” Under the reign of Oldjaitu (1304-16), Hamdallah al-Mus
taufi speaks in his nuzhat (1) of the caravan route, which had been
surveyed just at that period, from Gurgan by way of Dahistan (mod.
Mashhad i Misriyan) to Gurganj; this town was no fars. (380 miles,
exact) distant from Dahistan; (2) of a great waterfall of the Uzboi,
called in Turkish “giirledi, roaring,” and of a side branch falling into
the Aral; (3) he tells that the discharge of the Djaihun into the Cas
pian had raised its level so that, e.g., the peninsula of Abaskun (Pliny’s
Socanda) was submerged. 10 Marino Sanudo (1325) and al-BakuwI (be
ginning of the fifteenth century) confirm this description.
In 1221 the river turned towards the Caspian because the armies of
Djingizkhan had destroyed the great dam of Gurganj, as recorded by
ibn al-Athir, xii,257- After the destruction the river followed the natural
fall of the soil. But from the tenth century to 1221 it seems not to have
flowed to the Caspian. The earliest remark about it, in ibn Khurdadhbih,
is ambiguous, because of variants of the texts, and ibn al-Faqih, at the
beginning of the tenth century, tells a legendary story only. But ibn
Rustah, his contemporary (betw. a.d. 903 and 913) gives a very accurate
description of the mouth of the main branch, showing that it discharged
into the Sarykamysh; Istakhrl, about 960, copying the older ibn al
Balkhi, speaks only—though with much detail—of the branch discharg
ing into the Aral. al-Ya‘qubI, about 890, is the only author of this period
who says that the Djaihun falls into the Caspian. Yaqut, just before the
Mongol conquest, at the beginning of the thirteenth century, gives the
same information, but only s.v. Mankashlagh, mudjam tv,670 ; and
since he does not speak of it s.v. Djaihun-Oxus, and since Mankashlagh
is nowhere mentioned before, the remark can hardly come from as old
10 The SE part of the Caspian is so shallow, the shore so flat, that even a western wind causes thousands of square miles to be submerged.



694 ERANVEZ
a source as ibn al-Faqih, as W. Barthold assumed. Muqaddasi—author
of the description of the Gurganj dam—however, relates a legend,
according to which the Uzboi as the main branch had carried water
at an old time [that means it did not at Muqaddasi’s time, a.d. 985]
and reached the town Balkhan behind (N) Nisa (in Khurasan) ; when
once the inhabitants of Kath [pre- and early-Muhammedan capital, 30
miles E of Khiwa] had used, for 24 hours, the whole water volume for
their [the easternmost] branch, the river did not turn back to the Uzboi
bed, and the whole Balkhan region became desolated. Th is name ap
pears as Balaam in Byzantine authors shortly before the Muhammedan
conquest; so the region had water before that at the earliest Muham
medan epoch. And the scanty Arabic information on the Oxus dis
charging into the Caspian seems to go back to this time, before the ninth
century, while during the ninth and tenth centuries only the Sary
kamysh and the Aral were the discharge basins.
The Sarykamysh may be regarded from the geological point of view
as the normal basin of the Oxus : its bottom is about 300 ft. deeper than
Gurganj, while the surface of the Aral is only 60 ft. deeper than river
level at Gurganj. If not too much water is used in Khwarizm and the
lower course carries enough, the filled basin of the Sarykamysh over
flows and discharges through the Uzboi into the Caspian.
One must have these conditions in mind to understand the scarce
and seemingly contradictory remarks of antiquity. The ’Clgeiavr] XifLinq,
rarely mentioned, must be understood as the Sarykamysh, distinct from
Caspian and Aral. What Strabo xi (C.510) says after Eudoxus, and inde
pendently Polybius x,48 (speaking of the Apasiakai) concerning the
waterfall of the Oxus, though distorted by legend, should be referred
to the waterfall of the Uzboi mentioned by Hamdallah.
Seleucus planned to connect the Caspian by a canal with the Black
Sea, if Patrocles’ report of the exploration of the Caspian should be
favorable. This took place only under Antiochus, not later than 282 b.c.
Xenocles, the gazophylax of the archives of Babylon, had made acces
sible for study to Patrocles the original documents with the observa
tions of Alexander’s general staff concerning the problem. The purpose
of the exploration was to develop trade. Strabo xi (C.509 and 518)
quotes Aristobulus speaking of the transport of Indian merchandise



ERANVEZ 695
on the “well navigable” Oxus to the Caspian and across the sea and
through Transcaucasia to the Euxinus. Patrocles used similar words.
It does not matter how large was the volume of that trade. The idea
was to find, besides the long overland route through Iran and the sea
route around Arabia, a third communication with India.
In analyzing these records, not enough attention has been given to
the fact that the plan of Seleucus and Antiochus is an exact analogy to
Darius’ exploration of the Indus and the Indian Ocean before building
the Suez Canal. The plan of Seleucus implies that the Oxus was known
to discharge into the Caspian, else the whole plan would fall to the
ground. And the mere fact that Patrocles was sent off proves that in
the early third century b.c. the Oxus fell into the Caspian. The informa
tion on the trade route was collected at the east of the Caspian, and
is confirmed by the information gathered in Transcaucasia by M. Varro,
who accompanied Pompey on his Iranian campaign in the first century
b.c. (Pliny vi, 17). In 128-126 the Chinese general Chang-k‘ien speaks
of the eastern part of the overland route to India followed by the Bac
trian merchants.
Patrocles—however obscure his voyage be to us and how wrong the
result (see under ‘Sea’) —certainly made two voyages, a western one
which took him to the mouth of the Transcaucasian rivers and near
Baku, and an eastern one which went as far as the mouth of the Oxus
opposite Oghurtcha. His remarks about the Caspian opening into the
northern ocean prove that he did not complete his task, and reported
hearsay, perfectly clear in a note preserved by Strabo: “Patrocles says,
the mouth of the Oxus and the Jaxartes are 80 parasangs distant from
each other.” Let alone the value of this remark, but an indication of
distance in parasangs is no observation of a Greek, but information
received from Persians. Therefore, if Strabo, following Eratosthenes,
describes the Oxus flowing through or along Hyrcania and discharging
into the Caspian, as do the Muhammedan authors of the fourteenth
century, this is a fact valid for the early Hellenistic period.
We have no record dating from the Achaemenian and the Median
periods. But intensive agriculture in Hvarazmis—which is indicated by
the early appearance of its name in history—can easily have had the
effect that no water reached the Caspian. At a still higher antiquity the



696 ERANVEZ
Oxus may have reached the Caspian; in prehistoric times also another
line, from Amuy-Carjuy through the Unguz depression to the middle
Uzboi might have been possible.
There is certainly sufficient reason to assume a relation of cause and
effect between these almost cyclical changes in vast regions of Turkistan
and the waves of migrations which started from there, the first in about
1500 b.c., which led the Indo-Aryans through the Iranian highland to
Sarasvatl and a part of them to Mitanni; the second migration in about
900 b.c. which brought the Iranians into Iran, the third in 130-110 b.c.
of the Saka which went the way of the first, and shortly before them,
in 250 b.c., the invasion of Parthava-Khurasan by the Dahae. The Fra
varti ask in Y/. 13,66 “Shall our land decay and dry up?” The analogy
between the Saka and the Indo-Aryan migrations serves to explain what
happened in that high antiquity, and so does the invasion of the Dahae
into Khurasan furnish the analogy to the first steps of the Aryan immi
gration into Iran. Justin’s short excerpt of Trogus, Prol. 41, says: “De
Bactrianis autem rebus: ut a Diodoto rege constitutum est; deinde: quo
regnante Scythicae gentes, Saraucae et Asiani, Bactra occupavere et
Sogdianos” [follows: Indicae res]. Cf. Strabo ii,8,2l “The Scythai on
the Caspian are called Daai (farther east are the Massagetai and Sakai)
;
best known became those who took Baktriane from the Greeks: the
“Acrioi (Ptolemy’s ’Iariot), Uacriavot (Pt. : IlacrKat), Tdx<rpoi (Pt.:
same), 'S.aKapavXat (or - kcu ) (Pt.: - - airyaXoi), which came from
the Jaxartes.” Trogus: “Post multa bella Bactrii ab invalidoribus Parthis
velut exsangues oppressi. (42) Hi . . . Scythia pulsi solitudines inter
Hyrcaniam et Dahas et Areos et Sparnos et Margianos occupavere.”
This long preparation was necessary because we gain thereby several
criteria to judge the indigenous tradition in the Awesta and the inscrip
tions.

When first studying the OP. satrapy lists, I believed this confronta
tion to prove that airyanam vaejo, the original home of the Aryans, was
the land Xvarizm. As in the case of harahvatis, opposite dapavatoi,
hvarazmis would be a topic, aryanam vejo an ethnic name of the same
country.
J. Markwart had treated the subject from another point of view in
his Wehrot und Arang;11 his main idea, not easy to apprehend, is that
at the late Sasanian period, if not earlier, the two rivers of Eranvez had
become entirely mythical.
At the Congress of Orientalists, Copenhagen 1909, Andreas had made
a communication, on which first A. Herrmann (l.c. 1914) wrote:
“xvarizm, dies ist der Name der Landschaft; den Namen des Volks
stammes hat neuerdings Andreas in airyanam vaedzo erwiesen, indem
er hier das Heimatland der spateren Alanen des Abendlandes wiederer
kannte.” That means Osset, alan < aryanam, but the report cannot be
accurate. According to A. Christensen, Act.Orient. rv, 1926, Quelques
notices etc., Andreas read vyocoh=Ved. vyacas “wide space,” instead of
vejah. Benveniste, bsos 7, 1934, 265^., rejected this and gave the right
etymology: vejah to Vvig-, in Iranian generally “lancer, se repandre,”
Skr. vega “irruption, flot.” He too arrives at identifying Eranvez and
Xvarizm.
The name appears always in the complex form “airyanam
vejo vahviya da#yaya .” Benveniste emphasizes that the neuter
vejah, as governing the gen. datiyaya implies the idea of water
in motion, like voiyna, vega. But, the name being loaded with
11 The book was printed in 1907, but not published; the contents Markwart used in his lectures; only in 1938 H. H. Schaeder published it as posthumous work; it is useful only for details.



698 ERANVEZ
,airyansm' he is forced to translate “l’etendue iranienne de la
bonne Datiya, c’est-a-dire la portion iranienne du territoire que
le fleuve baigne.” The idea of motion thus is lost. \
' veg-, vij-, including all known derivatives, in Iranian means
either “lancer,” discharging arms, like lances, spears, maces, or
“repandre,” discharging water by overflow, nothing else. But
,airyanam‘ is entirely objectionable in form and matter, vejo
vahvya datiyaya or vahviya da#yaya is a regular octosyllable
of the same type as the other topic terms in the same region
formed with the name of the two rivers: upa uSesu raphaya,
on the waters of the Ranha, upa sanake raphaya, on the sanaka
of the Ranha, upa guSam apayzaram and patlpe dvipe raphaya.
guSa, Wb. = 0\. guda “Darm, After, bowels” is a figure for
a riverine formation, cf. guts for a narrow bay, or artery, Germ.
“Wasserader, Schlauch.” It occurs in the inscr. name of the
Panjab, “Five-river-Country,” satagud-. The Akk. version ren
ders the Median form in Beh. §21 by sa.at.ta.gu.u, NiR a and
Scheil 15, sa.at.gu.su, Xerx.Pers.daiv. sa.at.a.gu.du, Eg. sdgwd,
Gr. sattagydai; the -d hence is part of the stem. A Pali syn. of
Skr. sapta sindhavah was rendered by Med. ‘sattagud-, and the
Persians, not recognizing their “hafta, seven” in Med. satta-,
rendered it by 0ata- “hundred.” 12
patlpe, Wb. “directed against the water = umbrandet, with
surge around,” is a makeshift: an island has no direction, only a
thing made on purpose is directed “against the current.” patipe,
patiyapam must be a groyne or weir.13 vejah belongs to the
same category.
In Vid.1, after aryanam vejo, verses are interpolated speaking of
voiyna “overflow, inundation.” Aw. vejah, like Skr. vega, Aw. veya, is
12 Same type of name: Sargon, 8th Camp. 79: “Istaraura nar[tum . . .] etebir, I crossed
the . . . rivers,” with assimilation to Ass. Istar, of Med. *asta- or *astati-rau 5ah, or -ravan, m Tabari, Ya'qubl (Hist.) hasta 5 .n"5 “the 80 rivers,” mod. Hastarud in Adharbaijan. gud- probably also m Abargu, Bargu, Arab, abarquh: the nisba abarqu'mu in a Seljuq inscription proves the
Arab, -h to be unetv mological, henje “above the gud,” m this case a salt-river. 13 The deriv. MP. pativaplh “ablution,” almost “douche.” TPahl.

Cf. Vid., explanation of apo naviyi: “kts y apdan p'Ny’n.” apdan is “reservoir”; in the last word I would recognize, with -b for -n, padyab.



ERANVEZ 699
a word of similar meaning, viz. “discharge, overflow, irpoxoij,” which
might mean the area of inundation or the mouth of the river. The same
semantic development can be observed in Arab, madd “to extend, se
repandre” and madd, mudud “highwater,” e.g. in Tabari and Sha
bushti, or “mouth” of a river. But in view of the special situation—con
ditioned by being a vast region and one in Turkistan on the Oxus—it
is a perfect name for the lower course of the Oxus, the Uzboi, by which
the Sarykamysh basin discharges its surplus water into the Caspian.
That section of the Oxus is the vefo vahvya datiyayd.
The adj. ,airyanam‘ changes the topographic-descriptive name into
one of political geography. For, as a “Dutch portion of the Rhine”
presupposes not only the existence of Dutchmen but of a Dutch state,
and at the same time the existence of portions belonging to other states,
thus the complex term “the Aryan overflow of the Datiya” presupposes
the political notion of aryanam xsatfram, eransahr.
Apart from Vid.i, the term appears as locative airyana vaejahi vahv.
dat. in Tt.%vj and 100 ( = Yt.g,i6 ), in the “Awestic prayers” of Ahura
Mazdah and Zoroaster, composed by redactors whose language was
Middle Persian. Further, in the formula sruto airyana vaejahi vahv.
dat. in Vid.u, Yama myth, which is of very ancient origin, but not so
the very passages 2,20-21, the language of which is as inferior as their
meter. Finally in Y.9,14, where the formula, applied to Zoroaster, is
badly interpolated into the Homa myth. Hence, the complex formula
appears in no pre-Arsacid passage and is no true Awestic. The second
inference is: only the Yama myth can be the place where the authentic
prototype of the Arsacid formula once was used.
Eratosthenes’ ’Aptavi) documents the existence of the political name
"aryanam xsaffram at his time or at the time of his source. While all
Greeks regularly speak of Medes and Persians, Diodor 1,94 speaks in his
story of Zoroaster’s death of ‘Vapa pev yap ’Apiavois” an ethnic de
rived from the political name of the country “"aryanam (xsa#ram) .”
Markwart regarded Megasthenes, about 300 b.c., as Diodor s source, but
in spite of the different form of the name Zathraustes for Zoroastres,
the contents are so closely related to what Eudemus, pupil of Aristotle,
and Eudoxus, pupil of Plato, say about Zoroaster, that I consider the
passage to be older than Alexander. Eudemus speaks in Damascius, de

term aryanam xsatfram was used during the Achaemenian period, for
it was certainly not created in Alexander’s time. But in the prehistoric
antiquity of the Yama myth, such political concepts did not exist.
Eransahr < ‘aryanam xsa#ram is entirely genuine. MP. eranvez de
mands equally a gen.pl. aryanam, it does not descend from an adj.
‘aryanam. This Aw. adjective occurs only with vejo or with the noun
hvarno in the notion rendered in Plutarch by rvxv Hepcrutv. As Hertel
proved in Siegesf. 97, all passages in which airyanam hvarno appears,
depend on Yt. 19,0 and 1, and S.i,g=Ny.$,$, where the spelling is airy
an%m. In this formula, therefore, the gen.pl. aryanam must be restored
everywhere, and the adjective is limited to the vejo formula alone. The
Pahl. inscriptions have only ’ry’n < aryanam, and only this gen.pl. can
be considered as true.
The Arsacid redactors wanted to remedy the lack of relation between
the names of the two related concepts, vejo vahvya datiyaya as original
home and aryanam xsa#ram as actual home. The gen.pl. is unfit to
be used since vejo was already loaded with the genitive vahvya dati
yaya. Thus the adjective was invented for this formula. It is pseudo
Awestic: in “the Aryan overflow of the V.D.” the meaning of vejo
must already have faded to “(lower) course.” The process went on,
and, by dropping vahvya datiyaya, produced “aryanam vejo” in Vid.1,
“Aryan overflow,” meaningless, and only possible after vejo had be
come a mere name no longer conveying any meaning. The Sasanian
period reached the perfect parallelism of the two names Eranvez and
Eransahr. The authentic term used in the Yama myth did contain
neither “airyanam” nor “aryanam,” but was simply “vejo vahvya dati
yaya,” the overflow of the lawful Vahvi, that is the Uzboi section of the
Oxus.
Thus, Eranvez is not the name of Xvarizm derived from the name
of its inhabitants, and the lists, we have contrasted above, do not prove
it. The inhabitants of Xvarizm were the Tura, see under ‘Aneran
Turan.’ In Y/.io, the song to “Mithra in Peace”—older than Scylax’s
Xopao-fil-r) and Darius’ hvarazmis—^vairizam is, as Benveniste saw, a



ERANVEZ 701
gloss; it was interpolated when also the unauthentic name +aryanam
vejo was created for a country no longer existing and which had become
a myth: the course of the Oxus between Sarykamysh and Caspian.
The rich delta of the Hetumant in Sistan, too, disappeared. It is
today a hopeless desert, a dast i na-umed, but like the northern regions
sowed with evidence of prehistoric culture. The Iranian legend makes
Frahrasya, the Tura (Khwarizmian) destroy this flourishing country,
as if it was transferring from the Oxus to the Hilmand a last remem
brance the mythical thinking of the people had kept of their abandon
ing the original home.
vejo vahvya datiyaya, the genuine name of the Yama myth, was a
real country. The Arsacid and Sasanian aryanam vejo does not mean a
distinct region, but the mythical homeland as a whole, the Duab of the
VahvI and Ranha, imagined as the country of the golden age. It is an
unreal country, a menok in heaven, contrasted to the actual Eransahr
as getik on earth.
Thus, if understood as original home, the concept that the Iranians
came from there is true and historical. When the name was created,
the last Aryan tribes that had stayed there, the Saka, were just forced
to leave it and to go out upon the quest of new pastures which they
found in later Sakastan. But as a term of political geography, Eranvez
is entirely unreal and unhistorical : the Duab of the Oxus and Jaxartes
was never called so. The name Turan is an analogous case, see under
‘Aneran-Turan’: it designates the same Duab as the homeland of the
non-Aryan adversaries of the Aryans in Iran, derived from Tura, name
of the inhabitants of Khwarizm; but Turan was never a name of polit
ical geography for that country. The very same country is Eranvez as
aboriginal home of the Aryans, and Turan as home of their non-Aryan
enemies. A contradiction is not felt, because both names are products of
legend.
Whereas the names of the two rivers, of the ocean and its dike, belong
to the original notion of Eranvez, other geographical names in the
Awesta, like those mentioned in Yt. 10,12-15 (sun-rise), in Y/.19,66-68,
(Zranka), and the specimens of the 2244 names of mountains in Yt. 19,
the 16 provinces in Vid.1, have no relation to Eranvez at all. They belong
to entirely different categories. To separate this material of different



702 ERANVEZ
character is the first requirement of historical criticism, and since no
body who drew historical conclusions from the topography of the
Awesta has done so or even was aware of it, the attempts do not rise
above the level of the many answers to the question “Where was para
dise?” in Kashmir, Abyssinia, Arabia, Babylon, Damascus or Mecklen
burg. Original home of the Aryans and home of the Awesta are two
disconnected problems. The treatment they have received resulted in
“the Awesta was written in Eranvez,” worth as much as “the Bible was
written in paradise.”
Benveniste, judging such attempts, remarks with much reserve (l.c.
272) : “Si la tradition mazdeenne s’est attachee avec tant de Constance a
ce souvenir, c’est que le fonds historique et legendaire de l’Avesta se
relie a l’lran oriental. Contre ce fait que maint indice appuie, aucune
combinaison ne saurait prevaloir.” This sentence would be partly true
for the background of the old stratum of the epic, but it is not meant
to say that the epic but rather that the Awesta originated in the eastern
regions. Against that, Meillet’s statement retains its full power: “Peu
importent les indications . . . d’apres lesquelles l’Avesta se serait con
stitue dans l’lran oriental. Meme exactes elles ne prouveraient rien.”
Nobody else went as far as Nyberg; he deserves thanks, for the pre
cision of the exaggeration discloses its faultiness at once. To him,
Khwarizm-Eranvez is the country of the “Gatha-Gemeinde,” the real
home which Zoroaster abandons; Marw is the country of the hostile
“Mithra-Gemeinde”; the “Zoroastrische Gemeinde” on the contrary sits
in the “steppes of the Turian tribe of Friyana on the Jaxartes,” where
according to Vid.1,19 (Nyberg’s History of Zoroastrian Mission) the
asaro, men without heads live. On p.326 he gives to his investigation the
“Schlussvignette” in spaced print: “Das nordlich von Margiana und
[corr. “westlich”] von Sogdiana gelegene Land Khwarizm ist airyanam
vaejah. Es ist das Heilige Land des Zoroastrismus. Die nahe Verbindung
des Propheten ist so deutlich ausgesprochen, so fest bewahrt, dass kein
Zweifel daran bestehen kann, dass hier der Name von Zarathustras
Lande und dessen der Gatha-Gemeinde erhalten ist. An dem Flusse
Datya der es durchstromt [according to him ice-bound during 10
months] opfert Zarathustra, ja AhuraMazdah selbst.”
The very last words sound like quoting an utterly undeniable au
thority, but they aim at Zoroaster’s prayer—discussed here under ‘Spi



ERANVEZ 703
tama’—and at Yt.5,17, where it is the god’s caprice to pray to Anahita,
hizvo danhaha, in language of erudition, i.e. in dead Awestic, that he
himself might not get tired of inciting Zoroaster, the founder, to think,
talk and act according to his religion. Only one passage surpasses these
decadent verses, ¥*.15,2, where AhuraMazdah would pray (in Lom
mel’s translation): “Gieb mir, iibermachtiger Wind, dass ich vernichte
die Geschopfe des Bosen Geistes, nicht aber eines des Klugen Geistes,”
which would be not to destroy his own creatures by mistake. In Bar
tholomae’s translation: “Gieb mir, iiberlegen wirkender Vayu, dass ich
zu Boden schlage die Schopfung des Anra Manyu, keineswegs (aber)
die des spanta.” What a god that needs the help of the Wind for that!
These ill-conceived and illiterate prayers are the product of the monkish
Latin of the same Arsacid period that created the name of the place
where they were delivered : airyanam vaejo. They are certainly no proof
for the persevering reminiscence of the Awesta.
From the fact that old-epical heroes are quoted in a yasht to Vrth
ragna, Vayu etc. as praying at the Ranha or Vahvi does not follow that
these rivers flowed through “Vrthragna-, Vayu- and other communi
ties,” nor does Zoroaster’s prayer, in ¥*.5,104, make him a pastor of a
parish in Khwarizm. The inferences are utterly absurd. In Iran, where
historiography was never developed and legend occupied its place, the
“mythical thinking” of the people continuously shaped the historical
events which excited their minds into the ready moulds of the older
myth. The Iranians had brought with them, when immigrating, their
pre-Iranian myth, with its Indian analogies, the topography of which
reflects the Aryan, in some features even the pre-Aryan picture of the
world. The events of the period of immigration were told after the older
schemes, and nothing older than that phase is preserved. These tales
originated in Iran, and their topic names are Iranian, mainly belonging
to Media, Arachosia, but also Parthava and Persis. In the original myth
the Fire fights the Dragon for the possession of the hvarnah in the ocean
Vurukrtam; in the younger variation Frahrasya and Husravah fight,
the place remains the same because the notion of the Vurukrtam did not
change. But otherwise, the locality of the legends of the Kavi, of Hus
ravah and Vistaspa, which belong to the period after the immigration,
is the actual country, aryanam ^sa^ram, and no longer Eranvez.



XXXIX. ANERAN-TURAN
There is a myth in the Iranian epic of the tripartition of the world
between ©retona’ s three sons Sarima, Turya and Arya.
©retona, deriv. of *0ritavan, is the son of
*0rita A0wiya, the Ved.
Trita Aptiya. Bartholomae, Ar.Forschg. i,8f., said: “Aw. a£?/3iya: OI.
aptyas, equally well < *atvyas as < *atpyas. The Ved. Trita aptya, origi
nally a storm-god like Indra, fights demons of clouds. Indra has, in RV.
1,55,1, the epithet atapas. Hence, *atpyas can be the original word,
whence Ind. aptyas through assimilation, by pop.etymology, to ap
‘water.’ ” ©rita is “the third.” Connection with Athene Tritogeneia has
been proposed, rejected, and may yet be right. Figure and name go back
to pre-Aryan antiquity, for there are correspondents to the name in
Slavic.
In the Iranian myth the son has completely supplanted the father, but
the fact that the name ©retona is a derivative, not the ovofia tcvpiov,
proves the substitution, ©rita appears only in two places, Vid.20: “Who
among the flamnahvatam . . . yoxstivatam yatumatam . . . paraSatam
(corr. -tanam) was the first physician and pharmacist? ©rita.” The
later legend transfers also this role to ©retona: in ¥£.13,131, ©retona,
not ©rita, the inventor of medicine, is invoked against all illnesses.
paraSata, everywhere else epithet of Hosyanha, is here, in plural, used
as name of the dynasty like NP. pesdadiyan.
In the Horn yasht, Y.9,4, Vivahvant is the first, in 9,7 A 0wiya the
second, and 9,10 ©rita samanam savisto the third presser of Homa, and
each obtains as reward an excellent son, Vivahvant Yama, A0wiya ©re
tona, viso pu 0ro a#wiyanois, and ©rita the two, Krsaspa and Rvaxsaya.
The inference therefrom is that the pre-Aryan Trita Aptiya had been
disintegrated into two figures, and that the legends of ©retona and of
Krsaspa are two variants, developed in two different Iranian regions, of
one older myth. Furthermore, that the epithet 0amnahvant, applied
to ©rita in Vid. 20 and corresponding to samanam savisto in Y.9, is Old
Persian, as is Gr. Oapavaioi, name of the tribe inhabiting Arachosia;
the three forms belong to Ved. samnisva, Gr. K<xpvo>.
©retona supplants his father also in being the one who divides the
kingdom under his three sons. Markwart wrote in Erdnsahr 155:
“Wenn die iranische Sage die unter Fredon noch geeinigte iranische



ANERAN-TURAN 705
Welt . . . unter seine drei Sohne verteilt werden lasst, so hat dies in
der urspriinglichen Sage einen guten Grund.” The legend remembers
that the later Iranians once lived in their original home Eranvez among
Tura and Sarmatians. But the genealogical connection of the three is
no more historical than the great genealogy of Genesis.
The Arsacid period developed a variant of the legend, adapted to con
ditions of its own time, and makes (Gr.Bdh.233) Sam, i.e. ©rita sama
nam savisto, divide the world under his six sons: Dastan, Xusrau,
Mihrevandak (? -vanxk?), Aparnak, Sparnak (Spahrok?) and Nim
rud. The Sasanian legend, on the contrary, retains the older form, with
the names Fredon, Salm, Tuc and Eric, but interprets it as historical
relation of Byzantium, Turkistan and Iran, giving thereby an unhis
torical antiquity to the political constellation of its own present. Those
are normal conceptions, just as today political creations less than 30
years old are treated as something that always was and always must be.
Mah Fravartln, composed under Xusrau II, says, §12: “Fredon di
vided the world, hrom o salm dat u turkistan o tuc dat eransahr 6 eric
dat, u III duxtar e boxtxusrav e tazlkan sah be xyast u pa zanlh 6 pu
saran dat, Rome he gave Salm, Turkistan Toe, Eransahr Eric, and he
asked for the three daughters of Boxtxusrav (Nebuchadnezzar), king
of the Arabs, and gave them in marriage to his three sons.” In the more
detailed version of the Ayat\.Zam. Messina, in Bibl. et Orient. 1, 1930,
39-42, Salm and Tuc say to each other: “What has our father done
there! He has given the sovereignty not to the oldest, not to the middle,
but to the youngest son!” In Firdausi’s Shahnamah this thought is ex
pressed by Faredon’s giving Eric “sword and seal, ring and crown,”
hence the sovereignty over his elder brothers. This is an infringement
of Iranian custom which causes the murder of the youngest brother.
The succession of the youngest brother was not an Iranian, but a
Scythian custom. Herodotus iv,6 tells the Scolotian legend of the “royal
Scyths” who descend from the youngest of the three sons of their first
king Targitaos, namely Lipoxa'is, Arpoxai’s and Kolaxa'is. The names
Targitaos and ©retona resemble each other in the second element; 1
the names of the sons seem to contain totem-animals: -xai's is evidently
-Xsayo; to kola- cf. Ir. kaSrva “fox, sorrel,” to lipo- rzifya “eagle,” to
1 For the first element cf. Tepirot'xM’)*, with -toxman-, and Tpnai-TaixMS with -tahman-.



706 ANERAN-TURAN
arpo- +harpo, *serp-, “snake.” Before, Herodotus tells a third variant, with
stronger Greek coloring, familiar among the Greeks of the Pontus:
Heracles, i.e. ©retona as Vrthragna, has three sons from the Echidna
(half woman, half snake, cf. Krsaspa and the parlka Xnan#ati) and
the youngest becomes his successor because he alone is capable of bend
ing the bow, a motif told by the Iranian legend of Smerdis-Tanyo
xarkes. The youngest, Yavista, of the Friyana may also bear his name
as the heir, vaisapu#ra to this house of Tura. The succession of the
youngest son was also a Germanic custom, known to me, down to our
time, among some Hanoverian peasants. With the Scoloti the younger
brother, once, was the agnate, azata.
Yt.5, 9, 17 and 19 put Hosyanha as first king before Yama, in opposi
tion to Yt. 13, where he, still a foreigner, is the last of the heroes, also
in opposition to Y.32,8 and Vid.2, where Yama is the first. One observes
plainly that, quite disconnected with the Awesta, there were single epic
songs which later were united into one great epopee. The fragments
in the so-called “great yashts” are quoted from this redaction which
took place in the early Achaemenian epoch, and which had put Hos
yanha at the very head of the epic.
His name is derived from Vhu-, the pressing of homa. Homa grows
on the Hara brzatl, which is also Hosyanha’s home. Thus there are
reasons for associating this legend with the Saka homavrga. His epithet
is paraSata, which connects Hosyanha closely with the Scolotian Para
latae; the origin of the legend is Scythian, not Iranian.
Bartholomae did not doubt that paraSata was an Awestic
word, “Viell. voran, an die Spitze gestellt,” impossible, for he
was only subsequently “put at the head.” Neither is it with
Andreas-Lommel OI. purohita2 “vorangestellt, Vorgesetzter
(neutral), aber gebraucht fiir Ausiiben priesterlicher Obliegen
heiten des Konigs, sacerdos civitatis.” It is a very special title of
Hosyanha, a foreigner, and the application in Vid.20, as name
of a dynasty—to which Bartholomae annotates “der Verfasser
hat die eigentliche Bedeutung auch nicht mehr gekannt”—is
secondary and must not be used for explaining the word,
though the Pahl.Vid., following just this unfit passage, trans
2 This would be IE. V*dhe-, Skr. V*dha-, Tidtjfxi with purah “before.”



ANERAN-TURAN 707
lates pes.dat (origin of NP. pesdadi as dynastic name) and
explains it: “thus because Hosang was the first to organize the
autocracy, xvatayih rawak kirt,” taking “data” as “law, Gesetz,
TWrjfju.” The NP. dictionaries propagate this mistake, but
pesdat is in fact OP. *pasyaSata,3 Med. pa#yazata in (hu)pa
#yazata ( Ogmad.) and this is TraTi^eid-qg, title of Smerdis as
secundogenitus or heir presumptive, agnate in second line. The
derivative OIr. *pa0yazati was postulated by Bartholomae, ZAlr
Wb. 259 for Armen, payazat “successor, heir.” 4 Scyth. irapa
Xara evidently expresses a similar notion, and it is this Scolotian
title0 that is rendered by Hosyanha’s epithet paraSata. This is
not an Awestic word and does not mean the same as Skr.
purohita, nor “primogenitus” like Med. *parazata, OP. *para
Sata, but means the youngest son as heir. Its Sata is Aw. zata,
but para is OI. para “ulterior,” not purah “before.” The Pahl.
transl. pesdat < OP. 'pasyaSata, Med. pa#yazata for *pa/9yazata
“heir presumptive,” comes nearest to the non-Iranian notion.
The oldest mention of the name Khwarizm is Scvlax’s Xopa.o-f.uri,
a few years younger are Darius’ hvarazmis and Xopao-puoL of Heca
taeus’ list. Formed with zam- it is geographical term. Moses of Chorene
mentions a “district Tur (< Tur) in Xolozm (< xvarizm), a trading
country from which the x°lozmik stone (perhaps ambergris) was ex
ported.” Tur is a tribal name, very old, but completely lost afterwards.
Moses’ short note is the only historical reference to this people, outside
the Awesta. In the Awesta the name Tur a, adj. turya, appears exclu
sively as ethnic of persons, not as topographic term. Frahrasya, who
bears it, is the great adversary of the Aryans; in Ctesias’ version of the
legend his name is Parsondas, i.e. ‘parsvant for 'frasvant, 6 chief of the
Cadusii, the enemies. Theodor bar Kone, as recognized by Benveniste,
3 With 5ata = Lat. agnatus < ad.gnatus, IE. root ‘g'ena.
4 I assume that compounds were formed with para, pati, apara as well of zata as of azata, and that'they soon coalesced. 5 X may be right. Like OP., the dialect may have had 5 for g'; in Sogdian every d changes
into 1; in Scolotian—which itself contains an 1, cf. Lipoxais, Kolaxais—the change 5 > 1 mav
have taken place before Herodotus’ time. The tendency towards 1, strong in East Iranian dialects,
prevails also in Oss. alan<ar>an; Sarm. Xtl/iavos, Osset, liman = NP. erman < aryaman, “guest, socius.” 6 For p:f cf. parasanges:frasanhya.



708 aneran-turan
renders the name by Parisag. The MP. form is Frasyag, NP. Afrasiyab.
He is a mythical figure, whereas the turya Friyana of the Gathas and
all Tura of the memorial list of Yt. 13 and of the yasht are historical.
The only support for locating their country is the notice of Moses
Chor., which shows their name surviving in a district of Khvarizm a
thousand years later. If one deletes the unreal name Eranvez from the
lists of countries contrasted with each other in the chapter ‘Eranvez,’ a
gap remains opposite Hvarazmis. Harahvatis and Hvarazmis are
topographic designations. The inhabitants of Harahvatis were the Tha
manaioi, *Samana; and the people of Hvarazmis were the Tura.7
Historical Tura appear in Yt.13, 143-44, paragraphs added to the
memorial document of Vistaspa by the same redactors that developed
this list into one of “all fravarti of the world from Gayamart to the
Sosyant” (§145). The verses invoke “the men and women of the (gen.
pi.) aryanam, turyanam, sarimanam, sainlnam and dahinam dahyu
nam, provinces of the Aryans, Turyans, Sarima, Saina and Daha.” Here
one finds two names more than in the legend of the tripartition, and
the quotation must come from a story similar to that legend.
The last two ethnic names are vrddhi adjectives in -ya. Bartholomae
notes that the edition has saininam “die leichtere Lesart” instead of
sainunam of the good cod. Fi. The edition is right, and the mechanical
application of methods developed in editing classical texts, like “lectio
facilior and difficilior,” to the Awesta is wrong. The ending -unam is
caused by the following gen.pl. of the regens dahyunam. More wrong
is Nyberg, 249: “Die Saini, eigentl. sani, sind ganzlich unbekannt;
Daha scheint ein Sammelname fur nicht-iranische Nomaden zu sein.”
The i of saini is not epenthetic; saini is vrddhi of sena, n.pr. Sena ahum
stut, to whose mention in the document the redactors add “who first
appeared on this earth with a hundred pupils.” The Sasanian legend,
therefore, regarded him as a kind of apostle, and his nisba is Bustik,
“of Bust” in Arachosia. The Awdiha e Sigistan ascribe to him also
the authorship of a nask in the Denkart, which bore his name. The
Saina are a tribe or a very great clan, with the sub-clan Pesatah (pistor

ANERAN-TURAN 709
or medicus?) and ten of them are mentioned in the memorial docu
ment, three among the “foreigners” of §126. The later legend connects
them with Sistan.
Daha is no collective, but a tribal name. They appear in Xerxes’ daiv
inscr. I.26 as daha, El. [ta]ha, Akk. da.a.an, and the tribute processions
of Persepolis represent them in no way differing from the Par0ava. The
antiquated assumption is based upon comparison with Ved. dasa, anton.
to arya, cf. the remarks about OI. dasyu: OIr. dahyu under ‘Social
Structure.’ Strabo knewr their habitat, 11,8,2: “Of the Daai some are
called ‘'Knappoi [’E-nr°, or ’AcrTraptot], others H o-pOlol, others Iltcrcrov
poi. The Aparnoi lived next to the Caspian, the others as far as the bor
ders of Areia (Herat), north of a sandy desert,” and 11,9,2: ’Apcra/er)?

Sas ^TapoiKovvras top p, iTrrjXdep evrl ttjp HapOvaiap. Thus they
lived between the Caspian and Marw, north of Gurgan, where their
name stuck as Dahistan down to the Middle Ages, around mod. Mash
had i Misriyan. The Aparnoi or Parnoi are represented by Aparnak,
one of Sam’s six sons, in the Arsacid legend of the partition of the
world. One clan of the Aparnoi were the Arsacids, so that we have the
correspondence Parsa-Pasargadae-Achaemenids and Daha-Aparnoi-Ar
sacids. In Y/.13 the Aryan provinces are a plurality, the others are one
province each.
The Tura appearing in the gatha are equally historical figures. In
Y.46,12 Zoroaster voices the hope that “naftyesu nafsuca turahya fri
yanahya ojyesu,8 great-grandsons and grandsons of the powerful Tura,
the Friyana (adj.)” will become his adherents. Bartholomae: “danach
hat sich Friyana . . . von den Tura, eines Volk-stammes ausserhalb
Vistaspa’s Machtbereich, zwar noch nicht bekehrt, steht aber . . . auch
nicht feindlich gegenuber.” Friyana is, like Asabana, Spitama, a family
name, hence not “Friyana,” but “the (chief of the) Friyana,” descend
ants of a “Friya.” Only one other member of this family appears in the
Awesta, viz. “Yavista yo friyananam, the youngest of the Friyana” 9
in Yt.5,81, a fragment of a post-Zoroastrian legend, where he becomes
mythical. Later he is the great solver of riddles, a figure known also

in other countries. But the mythical quality has been imposed upon him,
in the memorial document, 13,120, he is entirely historical.
Only three names,10 Rtam.yahya.roca, Rtam.yahya.varza and Rtam.
yahmai.usta, separate Yavista from a Friya who may be considered as
the vispatis of the Friyana of Y.46,12. Another Friya in st.no is men
tioned without apparent connections. Friya, friyana means “friend,”
and occurs just among Scythians as n.pr. (£Aiavos. In the following
verses of Y.46, Zoroaster blesses those who receive him as fugitive, and
in st.14-16 he says he has found Vistaspa as patronus, and wishes the
Haugava brothers success of their journey, cf. under ‘Haugava.’ From
these verses Nyberg concludes, 248, answering his own question “Wer
waren die neuen Manner?” (viz. Vistaspa and the Haugava): “Der
Zusammenhang in Y.46 giebt an die Hand, dass die neuen Manner
dem Stamm des Turers Friyana angehorten.” That would make Vis
taspa a non-Aryan. “Grandsons and great-grandsons of Friya” are not
a tribe, but a clan of the tribe Tura, called Friyana after their ancestor.
If they are expressly determined ethnically by “of the Tura” and the
clans notarya and haugava two stanzas later not, then the tribal name
distinguishes them and stresses the fact that even men of foreign, far
away tribes joined Zoroaster’s cause, just as in Y/.13, 128-129, foreigners
are especially grouped together. The sequence of the stanzas is not
that of the progress of events: the contents of the last stanzas, the
journey of the Haugava, is the present; Vistaspa’s patronage is the past;
the adherence of the Friyana is the future. Some Friyana were with Vis
taspa, but not Vistaspa with the Friyana. The place of the gatha is not
the “steppe of the Friyana tribe on the Jaxartes,” but the nmana, palace
of Vistaspa at Tosa.
Beside Friya and Yavista, only two names among the 216 male names
of the memorial list are determined by “of Tura,” which may be tribal
name or patronym. This “community” did not live in the land of the
Tura which in reality was Hvarazmis.
In Yt. 5,73 and 13,37-38 another clan of Tura appears, the Danavo,
enemies of the Aryans like the Turian Fahrasya and the Vesaki-sons,
see under ‘Notarya.’ Their name is known to the Veda as appellative

and goes back to prehistoric antiquity, like that of Yama Vivahvana.
Their Aryan adversaries are Rtavazdah, son of PuruSaysti, and
Rtavazdah and 0rita (brother-in-law of Zoroaster), sons of Sayuzdri,
all from the memorial list.
The Danavo immolate a hundred sheep
(upa) brzantam ahuram xsetam xs a$riyam apam napatam
to the high, kingly lord, the xsa^riya ApamNapat.
Bartholomae: “bei dem (dem) hohen Gott . . . dem schnelle Rosse
besitzenden ApamNapat (geweihten Ort),” which would be the moun
tain Npat, Ptolemy’s Niphates, in Armenia. But the prep, upa, which
alone suggests a place name, is an accrescence, exactly as in Yt.5,65
(upa) usaham upa zavayat (ardvim suram), see under ‘Navigation.’
Apam napatam is the normal acc. object of V yaz-, the name of the
god to whom offerings are made. So it was said in the epic. In the
Awesta the Danavo bring offerings to ApamNapat, but pray to Ardvi,
just as impossible as Parva’s invocation of Ardvi “at the Usah” in Yt.
5,65. In both stanzas Ardvi has been introduced when the epical frag
ments were inserted into her yasht. The addition of upa hides the con
tradiction and may have been intended to provoke an interpretation
like Bartholomae’s.
Yt.5,73 is a late verse in bad meter and grammar, and no reason is
given, as is usual, for the sacrifice. In Yt. 13,38 “you (the fravarti) van
quished the Danavo ‘taSa,’ at that time” indicates a near past, and just
there the Danavo bear a historical title: bevarpati, Nyberg 251: “die
Danu, die aus 10,000 Mannern bestanden.” The danayana are imagined
to be a big clan; but a nmanapati does not “consist of houses,” but is
their pati, “owner,” and a bevarpati does not “consist” of 10,000 men,
but is their commander, sastar; and the bevarpati-sons in Yt. 14,59 are
not the sons of ten thousand, but of commanders of ten thousand. Bar
tholomae asked in Wb.\ “Warum hiessen die Danavo so?” Because
members of the clan were bevarpati. Scylax of Caryanda, a Carian, was
admiral of the fleet under Cambyses and Darius, and so Turyan Danavo
may have been generals under Cyrus. In later times one of the great
houses bears the title spahpat < 'spaSapati as name, and the name of
the Sasanids means “commanders.” The title is a military one, and just
as a commander of a division is “unthinkable” without lieutenants and



ANERAN-TURAN
712
captains, there cannot have been a bevarpati, Gr. fivplapxp’S or fivpio
rayo? without hazahrapati, xi^'LaPXOL and lower grades. The title im
plies the existence of the whole organization of the vast Median and
Persian armies. Whether the Danavo were entitled to it or not, when
these verses were made there were generals commanding divisions of
ten thousand. The legend is at any rate post-Zoroastrian, Achaemenian.
On the contrary, no connection exists between the Tura and the fairy
parika Xnandatl ya upa.hacat krsaspam, “who attached herself to
Krsaspa” and in after-days became the public calamity of Vaikrta
Gozgan, Vid.1,9 (cf. 19,5). No other passage speaks of her. The name,
without inflection, sounds foreign. The Pahi. Vid. replaces it by kama
klh “desire,” and explains “for idol-worship.” It renders upa-hacat
(= obsequi) mechanically by apar-apakenlt, denom. of apak “along
with” = to keep company. This does not contain any moral blame, as
does Bartholomae’s “die Krsaspa verfiihrte.” But a secondary comment,
not to upa-hacat but to apar-apakenit, says : “mnv.s TN.krt ‘ua.s’n.c Tn.
‘BYDVN.sn l’ p‘N.d’t'.” Tn, inscr. km, is ideogr. of oh, os < ava 0a, “thus,
so.” Hence: “who by him was thus-made; yet thus-making them was
unlawful.” Possibly Tn < kn masks a crude word. Nyberg 3x7: “Die
parika gehoren zum alten Glauben der Turer, Krsaspa’s Verbindung
mit einem solchen Wesen muss aus einem rein turischen, vorzarathus
trischen Kranz von Sagen um seine Person stammen : in nicht geringem
Grade der Grund der Animositat des spateren Zoroastrismus gegen
ihn,” who, 207, “wie Zarathustra eine verborgener Mahdi und die popu
larste Heroengestalt der Urgemeinde, eine Art turischer Herakles war.”
The facts of that far past were always known, and the remarkable
veering round of public opinion remains unexplained. “Liaison with
such a creature” sounds like gossip of a coffee circle; the motive of those
who made the epic cycle would rather be envy. The medical meaning
of such “fairy visits”—an expression still in use—is made clear by an
anecdote in Aghani, 12,85k, after al-Mada’inl, where Dja‘far, a son of
al-Mansur dies of them. No heroic figure belongs so manifestly to a
well defined region as the Sama Krsaspa, viz. the Samana in Harah
vatis and Zranka. In the Shahnamah his legend goes under the name
Rustam, who is Sakansah, king of Sakastan-Arachosia.



ANERAN-TURAN 713
Bartholomae Wb.\ “vielleicht eigentl. parika, fem. zu *paraka, spater
in Angleichung an jahika parika > pari.” Certainly the original mean
ing of parika is foreign women, singers, musicians, dancers, like the
women of the Qenite genealogy in the OT., gipsies before the gipsies.
If originally an ethnic, the people might be the parikanioi; else, “from
beyond, foreigners” in general. The Iranian “peries” are as famous as
the Muhammedan “houries,” but nothing is known of the “old belief
of the Tura”; all we know of them is their name and the name of their
country Tur in Khwarizm.
As far back as historical knowledge goes, namely to Cyrus, the Duab
was inhabited by Aryan, at least Aryan-speaking tribes. The most dis
tant were the Saka, divided in several branches, therefore in OP. always
in plural form, as against the coll.sg. of other Aryan peoples. Their lan
guage, now known, belongs to the Aryan branch of IE., but the sculp
tures, most manifestly those of Artaxerxes IPs time, differentiate them
somatically from the Aryans. Therefore, they must be a non-Aryan
nation that had accepted an Aryan language. Two of them, homavrga
and tigraxoda, lived on and beyond the Jaxartes; the Hecataean tribute
list in Herodotus gives three names: ’Apvpyioi, ’OpdoKopvfiavTioi
and HapiKaviot.. They did not move until the second century b.c.
The Saka on the Jaxartes are not the Tura in Khwarizm, and all
the less the Scythians. Herodotus makes a typical mistake in saying,
vn,64: “The Persians call all Scythians Sakai”; it is the Greeks that call
all Saka Scythians, a term for Asiatic nomads derived from ‘skuca,
reflected by Ass. iskuza, Hebr. askuz, (cf. the n.pr. Skozos), name of
the first of them to enter the Greek horizon at the time of the Cim
merian invasion of Asia Minor. Gr. Skythai is no ethnic unit; the
Persians cannot know the name of a tribe that perished in Asia Minor
before their time, and the Awesta does not mention any Saka. The Aw.
adj. rvi^dSa is not syn. of OP. “tigraxbSa, with pointed tiara,” but
means “with bronze helmets.”
The inadequate name “Skythen” in Nyberg’s remark, 251, “Turer
und Sarima vertreten die Skythen” cannot obliterate the fact that the
language of the gatha, which in his opinion were composed in their
country, is neither a Saka dialect nor Sarmatic. 262: “Alle Kampfe [be
tween Eran and Turan] haben ihren Ursprung im Ubergang des [im



714 ANERAN-TURAN
aginary] Friyana-Stammes zur Mithra-Religion and dem daraus fol
genden Gegensatz gegen die andren Turer. Religios gesprochen spie
geln sie den Kampf zwischen Mithra-Religion und alter turischer
Religion.” The Iranian heroic epic is no more the result of theological
disputes than the Mas, and the Aryans did not appropriate a non-Aryan
epopee, nor identify themselves with a group of non-Aryans.
What actually happened is obvious: To the Median poet of Y?.io,8

see under ‘Mithra’—the enemy at the western frontier, arzahi, on the
Tigris, were the Assyrians and Babylonians, besides the aborigines of
Media. The verses are so close to the historical events that the facts are
truly remembered. The fights of the period of immigration are the
foundation of all later legend. They were told after the pattern of an
older myth, and thus an epic tale of ©retona and AziDahaka came into
being, the locality of which was and always remained the West.
Historical figures like Boxtnarseh = Nebuchadnezzar, Balatnarseh =
balatsu.usur= Daniel, later drawn into this mythical history, remain in
Babylon, Nineveh or Dast i Tazikan, Djazirat al-‘Arab. When the
Frahrasya-Husravah myth was formed after the same model, they all
were called Tura, an easy change of name from a#ura. Of the ©retona
myth we have only a phase late in comparison to its age, and the place
names, varana as that of the hero, bawrois as that of his adversary, are
not necessarily of one and the same phase.
At the original place, Yt.5,33, ©retdna prays upa varnam cafrrugosam,
that he might kill AziDahaka, and vice versa Azidahaka prays in Yt.
5,29 “baweros pati dahyava, in the province of Babylon.” AziDahaka,
to whom the later legend gives a full millennium of rule over Iran—i.e.
the time before the Median empire, when western Iran was an Assyrian
province—was a foreigner. In “bawrois” of the text Darmesteter had
recognized Babylon, see under ‘ArdvI.’ Meillet called this “evident”
and discussed in OrientStud. Pavry 302, the grammatical form of the
name. I consider the Aw. and the OP. form to be identical : baberu >
MP. bawer, gen.abl. baberos. In Aramaic too, in Ezra and Daniel, and
thence in Egyptian, the first syllable is always defectively written, hence
bbyrvs, transcribed into Aw. script with wrong position of y as bawrois,
bbrvys. This is proved by the fact that the verse is one syllable short:
the y belongs between b and r. One cannot infer from “Babylon” that



ANERAN-TURAN 7*5
this was the primary habitat of the dragon, but one can infer that at the
time of the immigration the fights with Babylonians and Assyrians were
told after the pattern of the primeval dragon myth, and that this became
located in the West.
AziDahaka has a second place in Y/.i5,i9, viz. Kurinta duzita, a
name which can only have been introduced when the Iranians had
advanced so far west, in the eighth century, because it is El. karintas
(about 1700 b.c., from Kass. karaindas), in Isidorus Char. Karina
(=karind), still today Kirind, a place situated in a most impressive
gorge, above the natural frontier between Iran and ‘Iraq, the Taq i
Girra pass.
Not far from Kirind is the Haramkhanah i Shahrbanu, a cave in a
vertical rock. Like the same name of a cave near the citadel of Raga,
this is the Shiite interpretation of a very old sanctuary of the goddess
of earth, who took refuge in the rock before her pursuer AziDahaka.
The Sahrh.Er. mention this old legend in Slstan. The sanctuaries cor
respond to the many “Svarog” places and “Magdesprung” in Slavic
countries and in Germany. 11 At the Sasanian epoch Kurinta duzita was
also shifted to Kulangdiz i duzit in Laristan, Firs, along with the
shifting of the whole myth of the dragon, kirm, to Kirman.12 It is only
natural that tales which the immigrants brought with them from
their old home migrated with their bearers and were fixed at various
places in the new land.
©retona’s place involves a much greater problem. In Yt.5,33 upa
varnam catfrugosam, varna is bisyllabic. The adj. varanya appears in
the Hosyanha myth, the short fragment Yt.5,11, prototype of all other
repetitions of the formula:
ya#a azam nijanani duve #risve mazanyanam
devanam varanyanamca druvatam
At their original place in the epic such sentences were in narrative
form; it is only in the Aw. yashts that they receive the form: “grant
me that I . . Therefore, the meter has no argumentative power for

may add, from Hubschmann, Armen.Ortsnamen 444, the sanctuary of the H\arnavaz rock “leap of the bride,” in the canton Cluk.k' in Siunik, XE. Armenia. 12 Cf. AMi.iijbyff.



yi6 ANERAN-TURAN
formal corrections, druvatam is a specific Zoroastrian term by which the
mazdayasnian redaction adapted the fragment to the yasht. The same
faulty drugvant is added e.g. to the Gandarwa verses in Y*.5,38, see
under ‘Sculpture.’ Entirely safe, as genuine quotation from the epic, are
only the words
duve #risve mazanyanam devanam varan yanamca
“two thirds of the deva of Mazan and of the varanya” (those of Varan a)
and these are two correct octosyllables when reading varunya trisyllabic.
Both forms, varna and varunya, are authentic. Hertel came back to a
long abandoned equation Ir. var(u)na = OI. varuna = Gr. ovpavos. Its
epithet caffrugosa syn. of caPrusuka, term of the four cardinal points
see under ‘Krsvar’—is an epithet typical for the heaven. var(u)na is the
heaven. The Pahl.Vid. quotes to 1,14: “©retona was born there.” The
old god 0ret6na-0rita was born in heaven, which in the original myth
was called varuna. That is the last rest of the word in Iranian.
varunya is ovpavLos, varunya deva is 0eol ovpavioi. A forgotten and
misinterpreted synonym was “manyava deva, heavenly gods,” see
under ‘Harvatat.’ Den\.g, ch.21 (ed. Sanjana vol.17,55) describes the
mazandaran < mazanya deva as giants, the water of the sea goes up
to their middle, at the deepest places to their chin; they are cave-dwel
lers, and their fights are in the balistih, “heights” either of mountains
or of the atmosphere. In the Ayat\.Zam., Messina iv,34, they come
walking through the sea to invade ©retona’s xvaniras, and to eat men,
until he defeats them. This is not a mythical description of an autoch
thonous population, but a genuine myth. The giants come from another
krsvar, and their home, varna, was not on earth.
A scholion to Hesiod, Theogony v.139, quotes Hellanicus saying:
“There are three kinds of Cyclopes, (1) the builders of the walls of
Mycene, (2) the Homeric savages, but (3) the gods themselves, avrol
oi deal. And v.502 of the theogony calls the Cyclopes ovpaviSai. Aris
tides, Rhetor, ed. Dindorf 111,408, says almost with Hellanicus’ words:
(1) those in the Odyssee, (2) the ( wall-builders), (3)
tovs KaXovpAvovs Ovpaviovs. The cyclopic ovpavLoi or ovpavlhcu and
the gigantic varunya deva, both isolated and half forgotten, seem to be
two remnants of one conception of remote antiquity.
Perhaps this myth had been located on the southern shore of the



ANERAN-TUBAN 7*7
Caspian. The commentary to Vid.i (see under ‘Videvdad, Varna’),
tries to locate the mythical places in the political country Varna of the
Arsacid period, but the identifications are contradictory and only given
as alternatives. There was no real knowledge.
In making the opposition of good and evil the basis of his dualistic
doctrine, Zoroaster started from ideas existing before. The Iranians
saw essential qualities in natural enmity between certain animals; they
saw antipathy and antithesis between things, qualities, thoughts etc.,
and the Bundahishn devotes a whole chapter to this antithetic struc
ture of thoughts. In the political field it is arya and anarya, the latter
comprising all the rest of the world as naturally opposed to arya.
Though anarya appears in the Awesta only in Y/.i8,2; 19,68, Vid.1,17,
—none of them a really old passage—the notion is old and existed long
before it became part of the title “king of kings of Eran and Aneran.”
The notion goes far beyond the Greek distinction of Greeks and Bar
barians, which essentially means the difference of language. It is a
deep-rooted way of thinking, dominant also in esthetics: to the anti
thetic symmetry of abstract thoughts corresponds the urge for sym
metric antithesis in Iranian art, from its first to its last works.
Because of this basic thought, the legend transformed the many ene
mies of the only Iranians into one hostile nation, the Anaryans, between
which two existed a permanent, natural, hereditary enmity. This be
came the leitmotif of the epics. Ctesias is the first to give expression
to this dominant idea in telling how Parsondas, chief of the aboriginal
Cadusii, the Tura Frahrasya of the epopee, when dying, made his peo
ple swear eternal enmity with the Iranians. Ctesias’ work has from the
beginning been criticized as wholly romantic, in antiquity because the
Greeks refused to accept his tales as the history which the Persians
believed their legend to be, and in our times because one failed to see
that what he tells is the early phase of the Shahnamah.
A purely negative name like anarya could not satisfy popular legend,
and gradually the name Turya of the oldest enemy, the one who had
murdered his younger brother Arya, supplanted it. This generalization
was made easy by the existence of so many Turyan enemies. Just as
the country which one imagined under the name Eranvez—derived
from the genuine topic term vejo vahvya datiyaya—was indeed the



718 aneran-turan
original home of the Aryans, but unreal as a political term, thus Turan
is derived from the genuine ethnic Tura, but unhistorical as a political
term. Eranvez is an artificial name of the original home of the Aryans,
Turan an artificial name for the country of their enemies. The country
was in both cases the Duab of Turkistan, but it never bore these names.
When these were created the recollection had not quite vanished that
the people had immigrated from abroad in a faraway past, but the
country of origin had become a myth. The fact that the Iranians live in
Eransahr dominates the whole conception of the epopee, and had the
effect that their own forgotten homeland became the home of their
enemies, first Aneran, then Turan. We have the double antithesis of
Eransahr :Eranvez and of Eran: Aneran = Turan.
In the fifth century h., the proper name Turansah, with its fem.
equivalent Turanduxt—Schiller’s Turandot—appears among the Turk
ish Seljuks of Kirman, in the sixth century also among the Kurdish
Ayyubids of Syria, and among the successors of the Ortoqids is a queen
‘ismat al-dunya wa 1-din Turan-malik of Baiburt, in 632 h. In the sev
enth century H. the Salgharids of Fars use the title marzban i Turan
beside Xusrau i Iran, Rustam i Zal i zaman. These dynasties were Turks
and Kurds, and felt themselves as Tura; with them the word has no
inimical connotation. But behind all this is no historical tradition, it is
merely the effect of the Shahnamah, which all peoples accepted to be
the real world’s history, as which the Iranians presented it to them. This
attitude towards the Shahnamah is the same as that of Muhammedan
and Christian nations towards the Old Testament.
Markwart believed the confusion of the old ethnological notions to
have begun at the time of the Saka immigration, 140-126 b.c.; in the
third and fourth centuries a.d. one could state that no Aryan tribes lived
any more in the Duab of Turkistan. Meanwhile, the mythical name
Turan would have been transferred to those countries. As a matter of
fact, these shifts took place independently of the changes in the ethnog
raphy of the Oxus and Jaxartes region, and considerably earlier. Nol
deke had recognized and described the significance of the early Arsacid
epoch for the formation of the later Shahnamah, and Markwart con
tributed much more material in proof of it. The use of the terms anarya



ANERAN-TURAN 719
and turya for the later Turan is attested in Vid.1,17 and 19 already
before the Saka migration.
Vid.1,19: upa uSesu ranhaya, country on the waters of the Ranha,
Jaxartes; Ahriman’s counter-creation is a hard winter and tozya dahyus
awistaro, “toz-ian raiders of the province,” and Vid.1,17, in Varna:
anarya dahyus awistaro, “anaryan raiders.” The Aw. text of the Pah!.
Vid. separates dahyus and awistar, a better reading than the compound
of odier mss. dahyus may represent acc.pl. or gen.sg. The Pahl. Vid.
translates awistaro by apar.manisnlh, and explains the unusual term,
where it first occurs, under “Ruva,” by “ ’mt.s mys’ny’ MDM.KTLVN.d,
i.e. ka.s (or ke.s) mesanaye apar.manend, since (or: where) the people
of Mesan remain there ‘above’ (or ‘about’),” meaning either that the
Zoroastrians lived among such a majority (probably of Manichaeans)
or in their close neighborhood, Gath, nazdista dru^s. Bartholomae ex
plained awistar as awi.istar to Ves-, “owner,” with dahyus “Landes
herr.” Wackernagel in hido-lran. kz. 61, 190b (accepted by Duchesne)
:
“abi.s(ta)tar, people making raids.” The sense is right, but not the
etymology. Shahpuhr I writes in Kaba, Pahl. I.16-17: “vB‘.t, i.e. vxast,
or YB*H.m, i.e. vxaham, Gr. i^T-qo-apev, we raided (lit. searched)
Syria and Cilicia.” This “searching” consists in (11.5 and 12) “Pahl.
’trvxt ’vyrn v vrty’z *BD.t, Pars, ’tvrsvxty v ’vyl’n v vlty’c krty; Gr.
iKa.vcrap.ev, ripr/pwcrapev, pxpaXcoTicrapev . burning, devastating, mak
ing prisoners.” Thus, awistar belongs to \ es- “to search.” Skr. isati in
gavisti “cow-search = raid” reveals quite a psychology. In Arab, ghazw
“raid,” ghazi “raider” correspond exactly.
The Gr.Bdh.215, chapter on calamities, describes such raids: “andar
Xvatayih e Sahpuhr e Ohrmizdan tacikan amat hend u.san Ulai rotbar
grift ut vas sal pat asvar tacisn dast tak Sahpuhr 6 xvatayih mat avesan
tacikan spoxt u sahr acis stat etc., under the reign of Shahpuhr II the
Arabs had come and occupied the bank of the Ulai river (of Susa) and
had made for many years inroads on horseback, until Shahpuhr came
to the throne, repulsed the Arabs and freed the country of them.” The
same happened at the NE frontier exposed to the inroads of the Chio
nites. Gobineau has made these conditions famous by his La guerre des
Turcomans. The Videvdad passages show these conditions already in
the Arsacid period. In Babylonia, Mesopotamia and Syria it was the
same: the picture is typical for the life of an agricultural population



720 ANERAN-TURAN
with open boundaries along a steppe inhabited by nomads. Like the
Romans in the West, the Arsacids and Sasanids built their limes and
instituted margravates, marzban, against them. It is significant that the
Sasanian princes were not margraves “of a region,” but “against” the
foreign country, thus pahrag e Kusan, “watch against Kusan,” marzban
i Turan “margrave against Turan,” etc.
The adj. tozya is unexplained: it is a syn. of anarya which it specifies;
it is a deriv. of *toca, *tuca, pseudo-Aw. notation of MP. tuc < Aw.
turya, as a genuine old text ought to write.
In this passage of the early Arsacid period, the oldest testimony for
the identity of anarya and turya, the notion Aneran-Turan is defined as
counter-creation of Ahriman against Eran. At the same time, the two
places, Varna and Ranha determine its geographical extent: the merely
negative Aneran is all the low land to the north of the Iranian plateau,
which in the course of history became more and more “Anaryan.”



XL. MADA-PARSA
This country Parsa, the lovely, with the good horses, the good ment

Darius
The gatha never mention an Iranian ethnical or geographical name,
the Awesta only a few, and Mada and Parsa are not among them. But
the Assyrian annals mention the Mada and Parsua-Parsa often, for the
first time in 843 b.c., and allow us to recognize the last movements just
before the immigration of the various tribes came to a final standstill.
There is only one way for great masses of men and cattle to enter
the Iranian highland from the northern plains, namely through the
wide natural gate near Sarahs, the valley of the Herat and Mashhad
Rivers. Through this gate the Daha entered in the third century b.c.,
and turned towards Tosa in Khurasan. The Saka who overran the
whole of Iran in the second century may have taken both ways, to
Tosa and to Herat. The first Indo-Aryan immigration must have taken
the road from Sarahs via Herat to Sarasvati.
The Hareva, “Aribi of the rising sun” of the Assyrian annals, seem
to have settled first in southern Khurasan, Kohistan, then in the richer
Herat valley to which they gave their name Harev = Arab. Herat. And
with them the Thamanaioi, OP. ©amana, Aw. sama—never mentioned
before the Achaemenian period—must have come, probably before the
foundation of the Median empire in 678 b.c., by way of Harev to Ara
chosia-Harahvatx. There they may have still run against Indo-Aryans,
cf. the remarks on OI. dasyu and arya under ‘Social Structure.’ One
indication is: Esarhaddon mentions the region u.ra.ka.za.bar.na, i.e.
’vrka.zbarna, beyond the Caspian Gates in Parthian territory, hence
apparently containing vrkana as the first element; and in RV.11,30,4 the
n.propr. or ethn. vrkadvaras appears, Hertel, Siegesf. 25: “in halb ira
nischer Form, mit d statt dh,” as name of an enemy of the Indians in
fights on the Sarasvati. 1
Who turns west towards Tosa has no choice but must go on and
pass Xvar-Choarene, the narrow strip of watered land between the
high Alburz and the salt desert, to the Caspian Gates, the k\t)18e ?

OP. inscriptions have the vrddhi ethn. patishvaris, Strabo C.727, Trarei
o^opets. The name first appears in the Esarhaddon annals, 680-675 b.c. :
“patus.arra, a region at the border of the salt desert in the land of the
‘distant Medes,’ at the foot of Mount Bikni, the mountain of uknu [El.
ikni, lapislazuli], the soil of whose country none of the kings, my
ancestors, had ever trodden.” The Bikni is the Demawand, an old
epithet, MP. dunbavand < ‘dunmavant “cloud-capped.” In the valley
south of it lies Firuzkuh.2 The name Bikni survives in Binah, Bin Kuh
between Firuzkuh and Xvar.3
Xvar is OIr. *hvara < Ar. 'suara; patishvara is a sandhi formation,
Duchesne §18, Ar. 'pati.suara > ‘patisvara. The two names are a pair.
After 'syara had become hvara, an h was developed in patishvara to
maintain the similarity with the simplex. The reality of this phonetic
development s > s > sh is proved by OP. hamaranakara ahmi husha
maranakara in NiR.b. The Greeks heard patishvaris > •n-a/racrxopet?,
surviving in padisxvar.gar e.g. ibn Khurdadhbih 17.
The phenomenon was so common that wrong analogies were
formed: Sargon, annals year 9, 713 b.c., mentions (after parnu
atti < ‘vharnauhati) a Median town in Ellipi, bit-Daiaukki or
Aralli, i.e. SE of Agbatana, called ap.sa.hu.ut.ti, i.e. afshvati <
'afs.vati, fem. (Duchesne §22) ; Y/.17, 9 and 10 has barzisha
vant, Wb.: “schrullenhaft geschrieben,” the same case: h res
tituted although the s was no h. The Assyrians heard actually
'afshvati. Consequently, forms like OP. nisadaya to \'had-,
Aw. visavaya (Vid. 2,31) to Vhu-, armesad (in Y.62,8 against

patishvara, as a local name forming pair with *hvara, proves that,
when the two regions east of the Caspian Gates received those names,
*svara was still the spoken form. The change s > h, one of the main
marks of distinction between Aryan and Iranian dialects, had not yet
taken place or was just happening. At the time of the immigration
the Aryan dialects passed over into Iranian ones, on the Iranian plateau.
The language of the original home, Eranvez, was Aryan.
In 843 die Aryans appear for the first time in Assyrian annals, in
habiting the Kirmanshah region. They must have reached the Caspian
Gates before, but not very long before that time. The decades around
900 b.c. are the years of the immigration and before that time one can
not speak of truly “Iranian” dialects. From the annals one can trace
the order in which the Aryan tribes came and the ways they took: they
follow the main natural roads of Iran. Parsa and Mada advanced from
the Caspian Gates on the road leading to Babylon, the Parsa at the
head, the Mada behind them. The Parsa went down the ‘aqabat Hama
dan, the hvanvant pass of the Rxsa myth, and settled in the Kirman
shahan region, where they ran against the Assyrians. The land from
the Caspian Gates near east of Raga to the pass near east of Hamadan
was occupied by the Mada. One tribe, speaking a Persian dialect—if that
is the meaning of Herodotus’ remark vii,86—the Asagrta, Ass. zikirti
or Zikirtaia, took the northwestern road from Raga via Kazwin, Qah
vaS (Ass. kitpat), Abhar (Ass. appatara) to Tawriz (Ass. tarwakisa),
where the Urartaeans stopped them; they are mentioned in 719 and 713
between the two last towns, but in 522 we find them round Arbela, in
Assyria proper, which they cannot have occupied before 612, date of
the destruction of Nineveh. Their name survives in old Arm. syerth,
syerd (Hubschmann, Altarmen.Ortsnamen 321b), Arab. Si‘irt on the
northern Tigris tributary. If their language was indeed Persian, asa
would be aspa “horse.” A Median tribe, the Saparda,4 take the southern
road from Raga, through Kum (Ass. Ambanda, Sas. Kamindan) to
Isfahan, where the Elamites stopped them.
The chronicle of the “Fall of Nineveh” and other Neo-Babylonian
texts, in the archaic style of their chancery, give the Mada the name
* Cf. Gath, sprd-, 01. sprdh- “certamen.”

umman Manda, which they took from a work like the great omina
collection of the Assurbanipal library, in which older sources were
used. The name appears also in versions of the NaramSin legend from
Babylonia and Boghazkoi, but in no original old text. §54 of the Hittite
Code stipulates franchises for certain trading towns and professions,
among them umman Manda, at first believed to be an ethnic name, but,
as Landsberger has proved, meaning “any one, lit. who knows which.”
No support remains for interpreting as Iranian “mada” the word ma.da
in the date of year 17 of Ammiditana, great-grandson of Hammurapi
“in which he vanquished Arahab luma.da.” This last word means noth
ing but “matu, land”; for instance Subartu and Ansan were “ma.
da,” and the real name is dropped. No Iranian Mada can appear in the
early second millennium, and there were never any Manda in Iran.
There was the country “Man,” later ASarbaijan, S. and E. of the
Urmiya Lake; and the derivative ‘man.ti, formed like Armen, regional
names, e.g. enzi.te, andzi.t, or the Kass. adj. kassi.t.ri, produced Gr.
Mantiane, Matiene, name of Atropatene before Alexander. But just
this fifth of Media, the most advanced in civilization before the Medes
came, was never entirely occupied by them.
The Medes were a whole group of tribes, among which already the
Assyrians distinguish by epithets like “mighty, distant, of the East.”
Herodotus reckons six “tribes.” In later periods Media consisted of five
parts : Hamadan, Nihawand, Isfahan, Ray and ASarbaijan. These parts
cannot be reconciled with Herodotus’ tribes, four names of which are
hapax legomena, in 1,101 : HaprjraKTjvol, Bovcrai, 2rpovxare?, ’Api^av
tol, BouStoi and Mayot.
With the magi we have dealt under ‘Social Structure’; they were no
genetic tribe, but a social fiction of a tribe, a class. Only of the Tiappra
kt]voi we know that they gave their name to one of the fifths of Media,
namely to Isfahan-Paraitakene. The name entered into the official
designation of the whole satrapy which was MrjSta kci'l HapacTaKrjvi],
and so it is used by Ctesias and Eratosthenes. The same name was given
to the middle course of the Hilmand River, in Arachosia, according to
Isidorus. This region was called rudbar “fluviatile,” in the Middle Ages;
syn. of Gr. parapotamia, as Polybius v,5i calls the similar middle course
of the Euphrates. That is also the meaning of ‘paraitaka, cf. vi.ita.apa,
as recognized by Markwart, uge 11,33; without a long extension on a



MADA-PARSA
river, the word means “oasis.” Paraitakene in Arachosia is at the same
time called Sakastane after its inhabitants, and so the Ass. Saparda were
the inhabitants of Isfahan-Paraitakene.
trpovxaTes has been interpreted already by J. Oppert as an Ir. name
in -h.vant; Nyberg 334: “sravahvatah, plur. of sravahvant.” If so, the
name would be an appellative of the “helden lobebaeren” of the epics
(see under ‘Yama xseta’). Gr. str- can represent Ir. sr-, e.g. o-rpdyyvXo?
(on the Persian Gulf) for #riangura (Gr.Bdh. 112,3); XocrrP°'17 ? and
XocrSpoTjs for husravah in the Awraman parchments; KaXvo-rpioi <
*karva + sar + ya “baldheads” in Ctesias’ Indika, if the text transmis
sion is right. But in Media one would expect -vat, not -xat; cf. hvanvati
> Onoadas ( Tab.Peut.) > Arab. xunwaS; or sikayahvatl > Sakawand,
OP. <?ika “pebbles.” As river and placenames these are formed from the
fem.sg., as is harahvati > Ra^vaS, or Ass. karsibuti < krsivati, Zanjan
region, whereas tribal names are formed from the sg.m., and give the
mod. ending -wand. Iranian tribal names are used only in coll, singular.
On the other hand, there is the Ir. name sutrisna, or sathrughna (Arab,
usrushana or ushrusana). ’strusna, ‘struyna, with which crTpovxare$
may be compared.
Arizantoi, according to Oppert, would be “arya.zantu, Aryan tribe.”
Such are all of them; it would be no name. One may rather think of
ayriya or arjant in arjat.aspa. The name appears only once; if one may
doubt the textual transmission, it would be *6piiavroi, the name of the
inhabitants of Raga^rizantus, one of the fifths of Media.
BoiiStot < 'baudiya, to V' bud-, is no vrddhi of the name of the demon
buSx (Nyberg 341); buSi, bud belong to Buddha, nor is the tribe “a
caste of priests occupied with oracles.” The analogy “Stadt Kunduru in
Medien zu dem Gotterpaar Kundi und Kunda gehorig; wenn so, muss
sie ein altes hashlsh-Nest gewesen sein” is of no avail. Kundurus (in
Beh.), Hundur of Sargon, in 714 b.c., today Mong. Qutur, is a town
of Media only insofar as this included the whole of Armenia before
Darius reorganized the satrapies: it is an Armenian town. BuSi, and
likewise Kunda, Kundi do not appear before the Videvdad and were
no deposed gods; the only thing said about them is that they were per
manently drunk even without “bang.” The only historical name known
to me which could be linked to BouStoc is the family name of the

Buyids, ahl al-Boya(k).5 Of the Bovcrai we know nothing. Following
the above mentioned argumentation one could say “worshippers of the
deva Buzi of Y.4,2-3, and the booze, NP. buza, she personifies.”
In 843, the year in which the Assyrian annals first mention the Parsa,
they spell their name parzua; the country is called bit Hamban, i.e.
Kampanda-Behistun, and was still ruled, as of old (since 1200) by a
ianzu, a king of the old Cossaean house of the mare Hanban. In 835,
and ever since, the name is written Parsua, and the tribe is in possession
of the country: one observes just the moment of their descending from
the high plateau of Hamadan into that richest horse country of antiq
uity, the pastures of the Nesaean horses. The Assyrians prevent their
farther advance. In 744, TiglathPileser III made Parsua-Kirmanshahan
an Assyrian province ; in 716 Sargon added Harhar and fortified it “for
the purpose of subduing the country of the mighty Medes,” those of
Hamadan, a purpose actually achieved in 713 b.c. Harhar plays the role
of Nihawand at the time of the Arab conquest and is Nihawand-Nipha
uanda. But the Assyrians did not keep their conquests for long: all was
lost in 678, with the foundation of the Median empire.
In the record of the eighth campaign of Sanherib (704-681), troops
of Parsua, Anzan, Ellipi (appr. = Saparda, old El. Simas) and others
were fighting on the side of the Babylonians and the Elamite Humanu
mena III (692-689) against the Assyrians at the battle of Halule. The
mention side by side of Parsua and Anzan of course does not disprove
the later identity of Anzan and Parsa. Assurbanipal, in documents dated
between 642 and 639, calls Cyrus I, sar parsuwas, i.e. king of Parsa. In
the use of Parsuwa the Assyrians follow their old chancery style. The
migration from Parsua-Kirmanshahan to Parsa-Fars must have taken
place between 690 and 640, and probably between 680 (accession of
Esarhaddon) and 670 (one generation before Cyrus I); it was not an
effect of the destruction of Elam in 640. The very last decades of Elamite
history are unknown; the prophecy of ]eremiah xlix,34ff. “against Elam,
in the beginning of the kingdom of Zedekiah, king in Juda” may refer
to the occupation of the country by the Persian tribe of the Huvaza,
5 One may also compare the name Bohak, Karn. lrt.: Ardashir founded the town Ramisn Artaxsir when Bohak of Isfahan declared his allegiance. In the Shahnamah Bohak is prince of Cihram, i.e. Jahrum in Fars, which the Kurn.Ari., under the form Carham, calls the residence of Mahrok i Anosakzat, and which Ardashir gi\es to Burjak and Burzatur.

Huza, to be dated, in that case, in 594 b.c. This would be the last move
ment with which the immigration, that started in about 900 b.c., came
to an end.
According to the Nabunaid Chronicle, Cyrus II, having conquered
Agamtanu in 550 b.c., carried the spoil to his residence Ansan; in the
parallel record of Ctesias, in Nicolaus, the placenames are Agbatana and
Pasargadae. As the Assyrians go on using parsuwa, thus the Babylonians
follow their own chancery style in using Ansan. In his Babylonian
cylinder I.12 Cyrus says: “Marduk pronounced the name Ku.ra.as sar
alan.sa.an,” and I.13: “he humbled under his feet matgu.ti.i gi.mir um.
man man.da, the country Guti, all the umman-manda, he allowed his
hands to conquer the nisepl sal.mat qaqqadu, black-head people.” Ansan
is the town of Cyrus in Pars, Pasargadae; Guti is Agbatana, Mada; and
the black-heads are the Babylonians. In his Akkadian protocols, Cyrus
king of Parsa is styled sar Ansan, but in the 9th year of Nabunaid the
variant sar Parsu appears. So the equation ansan-parsuwa-parsu-parsa is
proved. Quite apart from it, one can trace the history of Ansan back to
the middle of the third millennium b.c., to Rimus and Manistusu, sons
of Sargon of Akkad, and it is always the same land, Fars, an integrant
part of the Elamite empire even before Sargon of Akkad.
This empire consisted of four parts, as the Elamite inscriptions teach,
and as the inscription of Ilu.mutabbil of Der (time of Gugunum of
Larsa) clearly expresses, who calls himself “conqueror of Ansan, Elam,
Simas and Parahsu,” i.e. Fars (S.), Khuzistan (center), Bakhtiyari and
Isfahan (E.) and Kirmanshahan (N.), that means “of the whole of
Elam.” Rimus who defeated Abalgamas, king of Parahse, calls himself
in Ur n° 9 “ner elamtimkl u parahsiki
, conqueror of Elam and Parahse”;
NaramSIn, whose original treaty with Elam is partly preserved, had
extended the conquests of his predecessor to “Elam as a whole, includ
ing Parahse.” Sulgi, one of the early god-kings of Sumer and Akkad,
at whose time Gudea ruled as issak over Lagas, owned all these lands,
and made one daughter “nam.nim, Lady”—possibly in the sense of
El. “amma hastuk, matriarch” of mar.ha.si, while another daughter
married the issak of Ansan. The spelling mar.ha.si is due to the later
redactor of the date-lists; the original must have had parahse, as the use
of this form in the younger inscription of Ilu.mutabbil proves.
But since the time of Hammurapi marhasi is the only Babylonian or

thography. Agu.kakrime, the Cossaean king who extended the Kassite
rule over Akkad and Babylon in about 1600, comprises the country in
his protocol under the name of his homeland kassu, i.e. Luristan in the
widest application, but he speaks three times of the marcasite stone6
which was found according to Hamdallah, nuzhat 206, in Little Lur.
Not much later, in the Kirkuk tablets, the name appears as paharasse
(with variants) in the Subaraean dialect of Arrapha, the region east
of the Tigris and bordering on the Kirmanshahan region. This form is
closer to old parahse than Akk. marhasi. Later glossaries explain mar
hasi by pa.ra.si.i (gen.), a form used in Hittite texts from Boghazkoi,
which is also the late Elamite form.7 Just as Sanherib in 690 speaks of
“troops of Parsua and Anzan etc.,” an Elamite list of the time of Tepti.
Humban.Insusnak, about 660 b.c., enumerates among sacrificing offi
cials those of parasu and ancan.8 Thus, Ass. parsua and El. parasu both
descend from parahse of the third millennium. OP. parsa is an ethnic,
derived with vrddhi from a topic name *parsa. The name which the
Assyrians render by parsua, parsuwa, is treated like Aryan *parsua >
OP. "parsa, Med. 'parspa. This is another phonetic change characteristic
for the transition of Aryan into Iranian, attested in 843, not long after
that of *suara, ‘patisuara > *hvara, patishvara, and corroborates the
thesis.
The Parsa must have received their name from the country in which
they resided from 843 to about 670. After their migration to Ansan, they
transferred, as is the Iranian custom, their ethnic—with vrddhi—to the
new home: Parsa, Fars.
Some Akk. vocabularies give lists of objects, like wagons, stones (e.g.
marcasite) and animals, among them dogs:
(Sum.) UR mar.ha.si= (Akk.) ka.lab pa.ra.si.i
This is probably the Persian greyhound. The most famous product of
Parahse, the Nesaean horse, is not preserved in the fragments of lists.
If it were, it would be:
‘ansu.kur.ra mar.ha.si = *si.su.u pa.ra.si.i

nally the name of a Nesaean thoroughbred mare.

Herodotus joins to his report on Cyrus’ fight against Astyages a list
of the Persian “genea, tribes,” a counterpart to his list of Median tribes.
More manifestly than the Median list, this one is an abstract from
different sources, even different in dialect; one source is Hecataeus. For
the first three names, Pasargadai, Maraphioi and Maspioi, see under
‘Notarya.’
Maspi is today a tribal name of Luristan i Pustekuh, in Layard, jrgs
16, 98-100: mastpi, cf. O. Mann, Mundarten d. Lur-Stamme, 1900,
Einltg. p.xxiv. In Narsa^i and Ya’qub! the name masf, masf appears
as that of the Zarafsan river of Samarkand. Nothing else is known about
the name and the tribe.
Other agricultural tribes are the HavdiaAaioi, AripovcnaioL, Teppa
vlol, opposed to the nomads Adoi, MdpSoi, AporriKoi and Saydprtoi.
Of these nomads scarcely one tribe is truly Persian. The Daoi, Mardoi,
Dropikoi (=Derbikes) all are known sitting side by side at the SE.
corner of the Caspian Sea, and the Sagartioi-Asagrta were in Assyria
after the fall of Nineveh. Herodotus seems to have heard their names
as auxiliarii of Cyrus against Astyages and to have inferred from it that
they were Persians.
The Pasargadae were according to Herodotus the Persian “genos”
to which the <j>ppTpr], vi 9, of the Achaemenids belonged. The next
early mention of the name is that of Cyrus’ residence in Ctesias. 0 Third,
the historians of Alexander, e.g. Anaximenes of Lampsacus, and from
him Arrian, Strabo and others.
Andreas denied in his lecture in Hamburg 1902 that the Pasargadae
were a genos: Darius, in his genealogy “son of Vistaspa, Achaemenid,
Persian, Aryan,” kept strictly to the Iranian tribal constitution: (1)
nmana = Vistaspa, (2) vis = haxamanisiya, (3) zantu = parsa, (4) dahyu
= arya. zantu is not used in OP.; Parsa is a dahyu, one of the largest,
not a zantu, and arya is the fifth unit above all others: aryanam xsa
#ram. Darius omits one step, the third, in his genealogy, and that is
Herodotus’ Pasargadae. Therefore, Herodotus is right in calling them a
genos, Aw. zantus. As usual, it is a topical name at the same time.
The name is only preserved in Greek. Markwart had attempted its
etymology as: *pas.arkadris, “behind (mount) Arkadris.” Long before
him, Pasargadae was believed to be paisyahvada [

pisya-] . But that place and its mountain Arakadris were situated much
farther south, while Pasargadae was the capital of Parsa, pre-Iranian
Ansan, built by Cyrus. The distinction is historically important: Go
mata, starting from Pesyahvada, because he impersonated BrSya
escaped from the islands of the exiled, had carried with him Parsa and
the whole of Iran, but the revolt of the second Pseudo-Smerdis starting
from the same point, did not gain ground beyond Yutiya and Krmana,
and these two regions, not at all Pasargadae, were subsequently detached
from Parsa by Darius.
Nyberg calls Pasargadae “eine entstellte Form des rein
arischen patishuvari, die bei der nicht-arischen Bevolkerung auf
kam. Nicht-arische Formen von den Griechen ubernommen,
z.B. Smerdis fur Bardya,” with footnote: “Jaccbsohn, kz 54,
1927, 260: Persische Namen durchs Lydische gegangen.” The
origin of the note is Markwart, uge and Gath.ust. “p for f in
parasanges fallt wohl der Vermittlung durch eine kleinasia
tische Sprache wie z.B. das Lykische zur Last, die weder f noch
ph besass.” There are names of persons and of administration,
of the Median period that passed into Greek through the me
dium of Anatolic dialects; Smerdis is not one of them, but is an
Ionic transformation, cf. crpapaySo? < Akk. barraktu. Neither
Herodotus nor Ctesias nor Anaximenes had heard Pasargadae
in Asia Minor, and how could western Anatolians be the “non
Aryan population” among which Pasargadae came into use for
patishvara ? The “non-Aryan” transcriptions El. pa.t.ti.s.war.ri.s
and Akk. pa.id.di.is.hur.ri.is are correct. Strabo mentions the
Ilaracr^opei? together with the Hacrapyahai and magi, which
rules out their identity, and his mistake that they were a Persian
tribe is caused by the fact that Patishvari was the title of the
Persian clan of Gobryas as prince of Patishvara. The Gobryas
of Cyrus was “governor of Gutium, Media”; the Gobryas of
Darius is represented on the royal tomb. In the same way the
Persian Vehviya owned the Komisene, next to Patishvara, and
Vistaspa had Par#ava, farther east.
The form of the name is always pasargada-; the only variant in Pliny
N.H. vi,ii5, Frasargida castellum, comes from a Seleucid author. If



MADA-PARSA 731
Ptolemy’s Tracrappaxa would mean the same place, the form is corrupt.
Anaximenes explained it by irepcrinv arpaTOTreSov, which would be
‘parsa dastakrta of parsa.staxra > Ista^r. But etymology can only start
from pasargada-, neither from parsa- nor -garda- (cf. Ved. grha, OP.
*grSa “pen”).
In the old country of the Parsa, the Kirmanshahan region, Salmanas
sar III, obel. a° 30, 829 b.c., mentions a canton sur.di.ra, under a chief
Artasiri, which the Assyrians reached from Manas (north) and whence
they “descended to Parsua-Kirmanshahan.” The region lies round
Sihna-Sinna in Ardilan. In the Sargon annals, a° 6, 716 b.c., sur.ga.di.a,
is the better spelling of the same placename, under an en.er, i.e. zantu
patis sepasarri, an Assyrian name for OP. *xsepayarsti (or the like).
The district is added to the Assyrian province Parsua. The names sur
gadia and pasargadai belong together, both as tribal names, and lead to
fsurpasu as first and something like argad- as second element. These
two elements, in reversed order, form the tribal name, rendered as well
by apyipTraioi as by apipacrvoi < 'apyipifiol in Herodotus iv. Both
are ‘argam.fsavya, derivative of the name of the Scythian Aphrodite
Uranie or Ardvlsura, Argim.pasa, i.e. ‘argant.pasu, with pasurfsu, type
fradatisu, vidat.fsu, see under ‘Ardvi.’ surgadia < ‘fsurgad- and pasar
gadae < ‘pasurgad- are but a different type of composition of the same
elements, though it is not clear which original sound the -d renders.10
The ethnic ‘pasurgad-, ‘fsurgad- may survive as topic name in mod.
Sul-yistan not far NNE of Pasargadae.
Of Herodotus’ other tribal names, TravOiaXaiot, seems to be mod.
Fahliyun in the Mamasseni region, halfway between Fars and Khuzis
tan; under the name Huhnuri “key of Ansan,” its history can be traced
back into the third millennium. There is the old rock-sculpture of
Kurangun, the early Achaemenian tomb of Da u dukhtar, the ruins of
an Achaemenian town, perhaps Taoke, and many other ancient re
mains. The name, with its only 1 in OIr. of the fifth century b.c., invites
etymology, but Stephanus had TrevOiaSai in his Ms. 11 A^povcmuoi
sounds like a derivative of darya.zlva “long-living.”

Krmana appears only once more in Greek literature, in Berossos
(Josephus, contra Ap.1,153) as the place where Nabunaid was exiled
by Cyrus. Fifteen hundred years earlier, the people of Ansan carried
away to Fars the last god-king of Sumer and Akkad, Ibi.Sin. Berossus’
version is right against that of Ctesias, formed after the pattern of
Croesus and Astyages, where Nabunaid becomes satrap of Karmania.
Before Darius, Karmania was no satrapy, but part of Parsa; and the far
south of Iran was always a land of exile. Herodotus calls the islands in
the Persian Gulf those of the “exiled,” and the caliphs used them as
such. The fact that Herodotus calls the Germanioi a Persian tribe
shows that his source was older than Darius’ reorganization of the
satrapies, thus it must be Scylax of Caryanda.
It was as a punishment for having followed the two Pseudo-Smerdis
that Darius separated Krmana from Parsa, for the people lost thereby
the privilege of the Parsa of being exempt from taxes. The same is true
of the Yutiya.
The Behistun inscription allows us to define their country exactly:
§40: Vahyazdata appears as second Pseudo-Smerdis in his home Tarava,
country Yutiya. This is Ptolemy’s Tapovava, inland from 'Ap/xov^a
in Karmania, mod. Tarun, about 75 miles from Hormuz-Bandar ‘Ab
bas; together with Forg and Farighan 12
it is one of the main towns of
Mahall i Sab‘a, district of Fars between Laristan and Kirman. After a
defeat at Raxan, at the border of Elam, Vahyazdata flees to Pesyahvada
at the foot of Mount Arakadris, where also Gomata himself had ap
peared as first Pseudo-Smerdis (§n), hence to be looked for where a
prisoner escaping from the islands of the exiled might land : near Hor
muz.
Pesyahvada means “before Ahvada,” cf. hvara and patishvara, Ahvada
is Ptolemy’s XOAAA 13 in the country xapaSpai, not far from "Ap/iov^a,

once had a good view of
it from Mlrjawa, between Warechah and Duzdab.
In 520 b.c., thus, Yutiya was the land between Hormuz and Kirman,
and its inhabitants had close relations to Balocistan in the east. They
are the Ovtlol15 of Hecataeus, in his list of satrapies (Her.m) where
they are grouped with tayapnoi, lapayyeLs (Zranka), OapavaloL
(Arachosians), Md/<oi (Maka) and the “islands of the Erythraean Sea,”
the Persian Gulf. In the army catalogue of Doriscus, Herodotus vn,68,
year 480 b.c., the Ovtlol and Mvkoi are equipped like the Tld/crves,
Afghans east of the Hindukush. 16 Yutiya, Ovtlol gives MP. zut, NP.
Jut, Jat, Arab. Zutt.
Zutt is the old name of the gypsies. According to Longworth-Dames,
“Balochistan” in EncJsl., Jat means “camel-herdsman” in buloci. Either
that is the meaning of yutiya, or camel-herders are called so because
the yutiya were such. One would expect “buffalo men,” because the
bos bubalus (not the bison) was their animal. al-Hadjdjadj imported
“ten thousands of buffaloes with their Zutt” from Sind to the swamps
of Wasit (Baladhuri) and Masudl, tanb., even believed that they had
brought the buffalo into the ‘Iraq, where it was indigenous since the
beginning of history. But Ptolemy, who ignores the Ovtlol, has in vi,
8,12 KafiTjXofloorKoi in the same region, at the border of Karmania,
“desert” Karmania, and Persis, and this name survives in mod. Deh i
Shuturun “camel-country,”17 almost 100 miles north of Forg-Tarun,
between Kirman and Fars.
The Muslim conquerors met the Zutt as good soldiers of the regular
Sasanian army in Bahrain and Xuzistan. After embracing Islam, those
were settled near Basra. Those imported by Hadjdjadj were partly sent

they were captured, a good riddance, still 12,000 strong, by the Byzan

gypsies began. Some had stayed at home, the Zutt of Qeqan < OP.

The Med are Ptolemy’s Ichthyophages on the south coast of Iran. There
are still today Jat in Makran and Kacchi, pure Dravido-Indian tribes
of low cultural level, related to the Med.
Down to about a.d. 1000, the Zutt < yutiya are often mentioned to
gether with two neighbors, the Qufs and Bulos, e.g. in MasudI, mur.
111,254: “Qufs, Buloj and Jut in Kirman.”19 In the Shahnamah and in
Istakhri, Mas'udI, Muhammad b. Ibrahim ( HistSeldj.) these two used
to form a pair, like an old dvandva : Koc u Buloc.
The first are the akofaciya of Xerx.Pers.daiv.,20 represented in the
great tribute processions of Persepolis. The name, formed like maka:
maciya from 'kofaka, means “mountaineers”: akofaciya > kofic, kohic,
koc. Ibn Khurdadhbih mentions the Qufs sah among those to whom
Ardashir I conceded the title sah. Seroy b. Sahriyar, 509 h., in Ydqut iv,
149, describes the Qufs, others the Bulus, as total savages. Istakhri, 67,
says about the dialects of Fars: “the Qufs, Bulus and Bariz speak their
own languages besides Farsi.” In the same way, today, the Turkish
Kashghai in Fars are bilingual. The Baric, baris, lived according to
the Arab geographers in the Kuh i Baric, north of the Qufs-kohic,
south of Narmaslr. In the Karn.Art. (Noldeke 9,2) they are called
barican, thereto Tabari 1,894, c^- Vid.i, explanation to varuna: baric.

Akofaciya was the inaccessible mountain region of Bashakird, east of

The region of their eastern neighbors, Bulocistan, stretches from
Kirman to Sind. The meaning of the name buloc results from passages
like y.50,6 (cf. under ‘Poetry’) : “The poet who raises his voice, vacam

Babak in Tabari.22 Sayabidja is in analogy to other broken plurals of
quadriliteral loanwords like sahrig:saharija, an Arab. pi. of MP. sepag
“slinger.” To this sphere Gedrosii may also belong. I believed I had
found the etymology when reading Y.32,10: “yasca vadar voizdat

“mace-swingers” > gedrosioi. Tomaschek tried kadru-, NP. kahar “sor

one possibility. Another way is: gandarwa:*gadarwaciya; Nearch
records an island on the Gedrosian coast, AevSpofiocra, perhaps TevSpo
fiocra (unless it be dvanra, Wb.85). The problem cannot be solved be
cause there is no younger name connected with it.
At a dark passage in Sahrh.Er. §29, among the “eight kofyar” (lords
or inhabitants? of mountains), the buloc form pair with the mlyPvc’n,
which may be no name at all, but simply an imaginary m-formation:
bulocan-mulocan. Markwart, uge 1,214, read marucan and connected it
with maruzan in Hamza, marucan in Faustus Byz., names of which
nothing is known. The text has actually something like malguc-, malinj-,
mlevcan, and the last can be compared to OI. mleccha, Pali milakkha,
which means the same as Lat. balbus, blaesus, “welch.”

name to the Dravidian language. Their legend tells of their immigra
tion “from Aleppo,” and all Buloc still today glory in their descent
from Abraham. No historical record exists of their coming from the
West, let alone from Media, which one might expect since their lan
guage is a Median dialect. Aleppo is the maqam Ibrahim, the prove
nance from Aleppo, therefore, expresses no other idea than the descent
from Ibrahim al-Khalil. It is a genealogy invented when the tribes
embraced Islam. Since nobody would have given credit to their claim
of descent from Muhammad, they chose the second best. Buloci is a
Median dialect, as is Kurdish, and there are Kurds living among the
Buloci and Brahoi. Brahoi is Kurdish for Ibrahim!, and that is the origin
of their name. They are certainly not a remainder of the “Lost Tribes
of Israel.” That the Buloc brought their language with them from a
northern region is a probable but not the only possible assumption.
They first appear in the late Sasanian period, and their spreading south

if they did so—was no longer an effect of the old Iranian migration.
Even if they were not more numerous than the few Kurdish elements
among them today, they may have imposed their language upon the
aborigines.
The administrative name of this vast region which stretches from
Parsa in the West over Kirman and Bulocistan as far as Sind, was in
the OP. inscriptions Maka (subst.), Maciya (adj.), today Mak(u)ran.
It is the country Magan, often mentioned since the middle of the
third millennium. Scylax, and following him Hecataeus and Herodotus,
call the people Mv/cot. These people were pre-Iranian aborigines. The
Yutiya, too, were neither Iranians nor Indo-Aryans. The names brzava
ciya—implying the notion barbarians—akofaciya, sepag, probably
Gedrosioi, are all Iranian, but of a type entirely different from Parsa,
Mada, Partfava etc., clearly names given by Iranians to “anaryan”
tribes. Against this fact the modern expansion of Median buloci dialects
cannot prevail: the whole south of the plateau has never really become
Iranian. The same is true of Mazan, the low country between the
Caspian and the Alburz.
It is only natural that the Awesta does not speak of these regions. The
pre-Awestic epopee is too old even to know such a new land. The
younger legendary cycle of the kavi and of Husravah is located in



MADA-PARSA 737
Media, the home of the kavi-dynasty, conquered by Husravah-Cyrus.
Vistaspa belongs to Partfava, not to Parsa. There is no occasion at all
to speak of Parsa. It is enough that not a few Persians appear in the
memorial list and the gathas, and that the architectural descriptions
of Yr.5 have Persepolis with its thousand columns in mind.
There is one material of a different kind which is an exception: the
many names, specimens of the 2,244 mountains in Suppose the
Swiss people were immigrants from Holland, and a religious book they
had left to the world spoke of a thousand mountains, these mountains,
of course, would be in Switzerland and not in Holland. Thus the 2,244
mountains are all mountains of Iran, the home of the yashts, not of the
alluvial Duab of Turkistan, the home of the old myth.
2,244 is 11-12.17, a queer mystic number. The series 7, 17, 27, 37
occurs in tablets of Kikkuli of Mitanni, an Aryan ; the same series occurs
in the criminal Code of Jingizkhan, and—overlooked by me in ami
11,8 and 75—in the UtNapistim legend of the Gilgamesh epic and the
Noah legend of Gen.6, 10—8,14. Among those mountains quite a few
can be recognized as West Iranian: asta arvanto “the eight racers” are
Ptolemy’s Orontes, Pliny’s (C)arbantum, NH. ^,133. The English maps
of 1918-20 note, beside the main summit, over 11,500 ft. high, of the
Alwand massif, seven more, all over 10,000 ft., hence eight summits.
The hvanvant, point of the Rysa legend, lies at the northern end of
this massif, rzifya, Ass. arzibia, Urart. arsibi, is east of the Urmiya Lake,
the Cecista>Sez of the Husravah legend; rzis > listar, Ass. arazias
is south of Nihawand. The asan(g)vant > Sahand, Ass. sangibuti, is
the very high mountain south of Tawrlz. Here we have mentioned
the kanso.tafSra, Koh i Tafdan, a volcano, 13,400 ft. high. If the
analysis, given under ‘Sea,’ of rvnyv’d-myt ?k’ proves true, the first
must be a high summit on the Indian Ocean, the second perhaps the
Koh i Namak in Laristan. Every progress in the determination of these
names will increase the number of western and southern Iranian
mountains in Yasht 19, for the horizon of the oldest dateable parts of
the Awesta is circumscribed by the four frontiers of arya.sayanam:
Indus, Jaxartes, Tigris and Indian Ocean, and in the later parts it in
cludes the three great seas.



XLI. VIDEVDAD
From its title the Videvdad is a “Code against the Deva,” from its
content a collection of ecclesiastical ordinances on purification, in which
pieces widely differing in age, some of them without apparent connec
tion with the purpose of the book, are put together, in faulty language
and infantile form, to be learned by heart. A very great number of
words are inverse Awestic reconstructions from Middle Iranian. The
character of the language, cf. Bartholomae, ZAirWb. 177, forbids as
sumption of any early date for the compilation. Aw. data videva does
not occur in any passage old enough to imply that such a collection of
“laws against the deva” existed before the Arsacid period. The dis
crepancy between this title and the contents will one day find an unex
pected explanation.
The first three chapters are no collection of ordinances. Videvdad 1
is a little poem, of originally 18 stanzas, in praise of 16 countries; chap
ters 11 and hi contain the Yama-myth. Nyberg 337: “Die alte zoroas
trische Urkunde, die der Schrift als Einleitung dient, . . . zeigt dass der
Zoroastrismus Raga und den Westen erreicht hatte.” If chapt. 1 were
the introduction of the code, then 11 and in would be the preface to the
second edition. The fact that these pieces are preserved in the same
volume creates no connection of contents. We have three disconnected
works: 1, a poem on geography, n-ni, the epic of Yama—see ‘Yama
Xseta’—and in all the following chapters a code. This code was put
together after the first half of the Arsacid period, about the beginning
of our era.
Of the stanzas of Vid.i, the first is the introduction, 18 the conclusion.
The rest is built after the same pattern for all the sixteen countries: “I,
AhuraMazdah, have created as first-best country the country A, epithet;
Ahrimanyus has created as patiyaram, ‘opposition, antagonism’ against
it something.” The introduction explains what this means: “azam
daSam aso rama.datim noit kudat.satim yaSi azam noit daSyam aso
rama.datim noit kudat.satim vispo ahus astva aryanam vejo frasnvat.”
All translations, among them one by G. Hiising, Mitt.Wien.Geogr.
Ges. 1909, 392ff., follow Bartholomae: “Ich, A.M., machte auch den
nicht irgendwie Freuden bietenden Ort zu einem friedengewahrenden:
wenn ich (literally repeated) das nicht gethan, wiirde die gesamte



VTDEVDAD 739
Menschheit nach dem Arischen Vejah gekommen sein.” Benveniste,
bsos vii,265#. : “Tous les hommes s’y fussent concentres, si A.M. n’avait
pas rendu habitables memes les lieux ingrats.” The term aryanam vejo
has been fully discussed in its chapter. Such “unless” sentences are
typical for late exegetical passages in the Awesta. The Pahl. translation
renders the verb frasnvat by frac-rawisnih but he, as if reading fra
syavat, which apparently was the better text; the country stands in the
accusative of direction.
Nyberg, who mocks the 19th century picture of Zoroaster as “Land
pfarrer,” paints the god as superintendent visiting his churches: “Wenn
A.M. nicht die verschiedenen Gebiete besuchte und ‘guten Weidefrie
den’ [for ‘raman’] in ihnen aufrichtete, so ware Ar.Vejah der einzig
bewohnbare Ort der Welt. A.M. spricht natiirlich im Sinne der . . .
Gemeinde; die . . . Satze motivieren die zoroastrische Mission. Wenn
die Gemeinde sich nicht verbreitete, so wiirde die ganze Menschhait
genotigt sein, in der urspriinglichen Heimat der Gemeinde, Ar.Vejo,
zu wohnen, die ganze Welt ware dann unbewohnbar.” Instead of this
conclusion one expects “the whole world would know nothing about
this institution” or something about scarcity of lodgings in Eranvez.
On p.326, in spaced print: “Die Aufzahlung der Lander des Videvdad
ist der Ausdruck eines geschichtlichen Ereignisablaufs, der zoroastri
schen Mission.” There was never a Zoroastrian “mission” in the Chris
tian, and not even in the Muhammedan sense.
The understanding depends on kudat.sati. This word is formed like
kudo.zata in Y.39,2: “the souls of the where-born men and women,”
which does not mean locality, but rank: low, high, well born. The base
sata, for old syata, Lat. quietus, here and in OP., means the peace
brought about by religion. Without religion and law, violence domi
nates. Here [kudat]sati is opposed to the following syn. rama[dati],
as sad and ram alternate in TPahl. and in Sasanian placenames, re
vealing the dialect-mixing character of the language, kudat.sati means
“wherefrom, by whom peaceful?”, with negation noit-kudat.sati “from
nowhere-peaceful, if I had not made them ramadati,”1 that is “other
wise unpeaceful.”
1 Cf. the idiom NP. kuja?, Arab, wain?, “where is . . . ?” for something that is not the
case or that makes all the difference: Ubi sunt? —Fuere!



VIDEVDAD
740
That is not at all “not anyhow offering pleasure,” but “peaceful only
through my work,” and explains at once the composition of the stanzas:
the first half tells, by the praising epithets of the places, the good quali
ties given by AhuraMazdah, the second half describes their bad qualities
as work of Ahrimanyus.2 Whereas in pre-Zoroastrian polytheism rama.
sayana “making abide in peace” is a special epithet of Mithra, here
AhuraMazdah plays the role, as he does in the OP. inscriptions: “hya
imam syatim ada.” The verses say
“I, AhuraMazdah, have made peaceful the otherwise unpeaceful
countries; if I had not made peaceful the otherwise-unpeaceful coun
tries, the whole humanity would want to emigrate to Eranvez.”
That means, if there was only Ahriman’s work, the earth would be
uninhabitable, men would want to leave it. No community is excepted,
and all mortals, not only missionaries, would suffer. Eranvez, in this
poem which might be composed today, is an unreal Elysium. Therefore
the Pahl.Vid. considers it—like the Babylonians their “nage” beyond the
nar marratum—as an inaccessible krsvar outside the oecumene: “ce ac
kisvar 6 kisvar be pa parvan e yazdan n.y.’y’ raftan ne tavan,3 for from
kisvar to kisvar one cannot travel without passport from God,” as to
day. The Bundahishn (Gr.Bdh.j5, Ind. X133) makes a similar remark
about the “fortresses” (’vb.”w?) of ^vaniras, “the access to which has
been shut off by heavenly power at this period of calamity, counterparts
to the six outer kisvar” (cf. under ‘Post and Travels’).
Among the gifts of Ahriman are ara^wiyaca daxsta in st. 17 and 18.
Markwart translated, Wehrot 132, “unzeitige Menstruation”; Nyberg
472 (note to 322) : “ungebiihrliche Erkennungszeichen” and comments:
“nicht-ratu-isch, d.i. keinem der der Lichtwelt zugehorigen ratu’s unter
stellt, namlich Kleidung, als politisches und religioses Kennzeichen der
Zugehorigkeit zu einer Kultgemeinschaft.” One could easily adduce
as evidence al-Mutawakkil’s decree against the ahl al-dhimma, in Tabari
m,i369ff., ruling that all Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians were to wear
“two yellow patches, each a span long and wide, on breast and back
of their dresses,” like the yellow star in Germany. But the following §18
says: “In Haft-Hind (Panjab) ara#wyaca daxsta arafhvyamca +garmam
2 The Pahl. comment, calls them “daxsak,” also used for translating Aw. daxsta, characteristics, as opposed to the patiyarak, the gifts of Ahriman. 6 The word not transcribed is perhaps “ As \ = ka>(e;, somehoJv," with negation “nobody.”



VIDEVDAD 741
(Mss.garmaum) prevail,” i.e. intemperate climate, excessive heat.
ra#wya is adj. of ratu, 01. rtu “space of time, period, season,” also
Kaipos, in Gathic also = iudicium, hence “anomalous, excessif, without
ratio and proportio.” Benveniste translates e.g. araflwya.brta by “traite
illegalement.”
Many of the words for Ahriman’s counter-creation are not only
hapax, but spurious. Three times they are raids, ghazw, four times im
morality, three times vermin, four times diseases or vermin, once a bad
fairy, once scepsis and once hyperscepsis. The last two presuppose maz
dayasnian religion, and scepsis prevails just at Nisaya, capital of the
first Parthian kingdom, hyperscepsis at Raga-Europus, the alleged
“Hauptmissionsstation im Westen,” Nyberg 320, 342 and 396.
The dualism of good and evil, expressed in the structure of the single
stanzas, dominates the entire composition. It explains the sequence
from the “first-” to the “sixteenth-best” country, and the conclusion
“there are more lovely, marvelous and praiseworthy towns and coun
tries.” The sixteen are but a selection out of many, as all Iranian lists
of countries are. The good qualities, well known to the hearer, manifest
themselves only in the epithets of the places; the devil’s work, told
with more detail, is a warning for the pious. Thus the strange impres
sion is produced that one had better emigrate even from the very best
of countries, Eranvez.
The dualism explains also the lack of topographic order. This style
begins in the lists of the OP. inscriptions which show in parts a certain
geographical order, but then again strange leaps. Choice and order of
the Videvdad list are determined by sentimental reasons, it is a “moral
introduction to geography.”
This specifically Persian literary type lives on. If the Sahriha e Eran,
Countries of Iran, composed for Kavat shortly before a.d. 500, are said
to have been written because the king wanted to choose the “first-best
place” as his residence—a purpose which hardly required the treating of
60 not-best places—this is the Arab interpretation of the same literary
principle as that of the Videvdad. The Gr.Bdh. 79 quotes the Sahriha
under the title “ayatkariha e sahriha, memorabilities of the provinces”
as source of its chapter on the “cigonih, qualities” of the mountains; it
is likewise the source of the chapters on rivers, seas etc. The translation
“provincial capitals” of sahriha, therefore, is wrong: sahr means “prov



VIDEVDAD
742
ince”; the chapter on “towns” is preserved in the treatise, of the other
chapters only the quotations in the Bundahishn. The term “cigonih”
reveals the same leading principle as in the Videvdad. When reading
Videvdad 1 and the introduction of the Sahrihd, preserved in ibn Faqih
and Muqaddasi, the same impression is produced: as if the Iranian
countries had none but bad qualities. That is Ahriman’s work. Videvdad
1 is not a “history of the mission,” but “geographical character sketches.”
They start with Eranvez, mentioned by AhuraMazdah in the intro
ductory stanza: it is the first-best country, Elysium, though only two
plagues are mentioned: roSita snakes and a hard winter. For roSita
“red,” the Pahl.Vid. has lvtyk, river snakes; the Pahl.Vid. has “lvtyk,
water-snakes.” The epithet of the winter, devaSata, properly “created by
the gods,” in the style of the late period means “the much-pernicious
Ahriman created it.”
To Eranvez some verses of different character are added:
dasa avaffra maho
teca hanti sarta apo
aSa zimahe maSim
aSa zyascit paripatati
zayana dva hamina
sarta zom5 sarta urvara
aSa zimahe zrSem
aSa frestam voiynanam
“There are ten months winter, two summer; and in winter the waters
are frozen, the earth frozen, the plants frozen ; it is the winter’s middle,
the winter’s heart ; when the winter breaks (mpeTrireTat) there is noth
ing but inundations.”
The verses are ungrammatical but archaic, perhaps differing in meter
from the other stanzas, and could be restored. Waters, earth and plants
being frozen means that agriculture and cattle-breeding are impossible
during ten months of the year. Pahl.Vid.1,4 adds: “v.’hr.c hafta hanti
hamino maha panca zayana askar, normally seven months summer,
five winter, of course.” This is obviously no description of the “first
best” country. Already Darmesteter wrote Z.A.11,7: “tout ce passage a
les allures d’une citation interpolee,” cf. ami 11,104,2 and assenting Ben
veniste bsos vu,265ff. “Only two months of summer” would allow one
to determine the latitude near the Polar Circle, while Nyberg 315
locates Eranvez in Khwarizm, latitude of Constantinople and Rome,



VIDEVDAD 743
and yet refers, 326, this description of a tundra to it: “it was the best
of all lands.”
Two points of support were enough to interpolate these old verses
into the younger poem: winter is Ahriman’s counter-creation in Eran
vez, and in the Yama myth which the conception of the late period
places in Eranvez, the cataclysm of the winters puts an end to the eter
nal spring, cf. Y(. 10,50 under ‘Eranvez.’ Vid.2,22, Yama-myth, says:
“The (bad?) winters will befall the (bad?) mankind; first the clouds
from the high mountains will drop snow, cubits high, . . . only a third
of all beasts will escape. . . . Before the winter, the land was grass pas
ture; when the snow melts, water will submerge it, it will be impass
able.” The myth is related to the Sumerian legend, and the flood in
Berossos’ version is equally a “kataklysmos, world-winter,” one that
recurs in the great “world-year” every time all planets stand in one
straight line in the configuration of “aigokeros.” The complementary
idea is the “ekpyrosis,” the end of the world in fire. The Aryans modi
fied the thought to “A worse winter would force mankind to emi
grate.”
The commentary to Vid.2,22 calls these winters “markusan,” a name
which also De«^.vn,i,i4 gives to a “winter,” Men.Xr. to a “rain.” It is
mahrkusa of frgm.Westerg&,2\ i “The month of cold shall die off, . . .
from the Drills the hard deadly winter will come, . . . mahrkusa
will die off.” Cf. Gr.Bdh., microcosmos chapter: “now the summer is
stronger, surtar, now the winter, but the summer is the stronger one,
surtar.” Hence the OP. name of the month 0orava(ha)ra “when spring
becomes 0ura, strong.” PEA 1147 quotes an eschatology for mahrkusa
which connects it also with the Yama myth: “In the year 300 of the
millennium of Uxsyatrta, mahrkusa will destroy, by three years of
snow and cold, almost all mankind; Yama’s var will be opened.”
The name of the eighth month of the OP. calendar, 21.x-20.x1, with
spring equinox as new year, is mar.ka.ca.na.s (Beh. §50, El. vers., and
El .Pers.tablets) or mar.ka.sa.na, °na.s (Pers.tabl.). It corresponds to
Akk. arahsamna, this to Aram. mark‘esvan, which obviously renders
the OIr. form of MP. markusan. The passages quoted above leave no
doubt that this is the name of a month; marsavan in Vid. 18,8 and 19,43

The words “the deadly mahrkusa will die off” play upon the name

The words for the countries are asah and soi#ra, Pahl.transl. ]ak and
rostak, both general expressions for settlements, the first a more definite
spot, the other an area. Since Marw, Harev and Ray are called so

and since Isfahan is used as an example for the “most populated of
asah”—the terms mean capital and province, like Gath, vrzana and
zantu. And since Eranvez, the first country, is an Elysium to which all
mankind wants to emigrate, all the others ought to be real provinces:

The names are badly spelled, some are inverse pseudo-Awestic forma
tions. But they are all real. Only the last one is characterized as mythical,
like Eranvez, by the addition “Where the a.sara, the headless-ones
dwell.”
The lists we have opposed to each other under ‘Eranvez’ show that
the center of all these countries of the poem, Par^ava, would be lacking
unless it were represented by Nisaya, Arab. Nisa in the north, Ruva,
mod. Ruy i Khwaf in the south, and by Vekrta, Gozgan. Nisaya is the
capital of Parthava, Nicrata—Ntcra/c of Isidorus, at the very beginning
of our era. The Near East of Iran is the part described with most detail;
the westernmost point is Raga, unless Caxra would be a more western

region, the easternmost point is the Panjab, Haft Hind. The Jaxartes
has become mythical and Khwarizm is not mentioned, Arachosia on
the contrary is represented by two names, and yet the name of the
Saka does not appear. That their name and that of the younger capital
Aparshahr-Nishapur is missing, while the older one is mentioned, gives
a clue to the date of the poem: the geographical horizon is that of the
early Arsacid period, before the conquest of Media was completed in
about 145 b.c., and before, in 130-110, the Saka migration came to pass,
after which the knowledge of the Oxus and Jaxartes region, now occu
pied by peoples from Central Asia, faded out. This date is in harmony
with the character of the language, which is artificial.
From the fact that just the two capitals, Nisaya-Alexandropolis in
Parthava and Raga-Europus in Media Rhagiane, are blamed for scepsis
and hyperscepsis, one might infer that magi from a more orthodox
country were the authors, that would be Atropatene. Under the younger
line of Arsacids, Artaban II and Vonones II, Atropatenians from the
paternal side, the orthodoxy spread from there, among the achievements
of which was the first writing of the Awesta. One must read in Tacitus
and Pliny6 the humorous description of the bigotry of Tiridates, brother
of Volagases II, on his journey to Rome. But such an assumption meets
obstacles, and it is quite enough to explain “scepsis” and “hyperscepsis”
as expressing the hatred of all Arsacid priests for Hellenism, which the
kings favored who bore the title philhellen with regard to the Greek
towns in their countries.
The poem is a geographical work of the Arsacid period, of approxi
mately the same time as Hipparchus, and scarcely a hundred years
older than Strabo, whereby its value is characterized.
Among the plagues created by Ahriman are interment in Harahvatis
and cremation in Caxra; vishrzana, in Hareva, is wrongly interpreted
as a funerary custom. This does not imply that everywhere else exposure
of the dead prevailed, for instance certainly not in Hafta Hindu, the
Panjab. At the very beginning of our era, Isidorus still mentions the
racfmL, tombs of the Arsacid kings at Nisaia, the capital where “scepsis”
prevailed. Trogus, in Justin’s epitome xli,3, mentions exposure among

the Parthians, not the old Par0ava, but the Saka tribes that had invaded
Khurasan in 250 b.c. Herodotus, speaking of the Massagetae, and at
Alexander’s time Onesicritus, in Strabo xi,2,3, record exposure as an
otherwise unusual custom of tribes in Turkistan, in one case prohibited
by Alexander. The contrast throws the fact into relief that about 300 b.c.
exposure was not yet practiced in Iran proper, and that Herodotus is
right in restricting it to the magi,7 1,140: “The above [remarks] are
made without hesitation as from my own knowledge. But as to what
relates to their dead, this is of a secret nature: I will not say decisively
that these are not interred till some bird or dog has been preying on
them. This custom, however, I know unquestionably, is observed among
the magi who do it quite publicly. But the Persians [i.e. Iranians, not
as opposed to Medes] enclose the body in wax and then place it in the
ground etc.”
If exposure, which Nyberg calls “la forme classique de sepulture zoro
astrienne” were the touchstone of Zoroastrism, one would be forced
to the paradoxical conclusion that down to 300 b.c. the magi, the Iranian
priests without whose cooperation no sacrifice or prayer could be per
formed, were the only Zoroastrians, monotheists, yet administering day
by day to the polytheistic cult of the nation.
Neither the gatha nor the old yasht contains any allusion to exposure.
Conceding this, Nyberg says, 310 : “Wir haben nicht den geringsten Hin
weis darauf, wie die Gatha-Gemeinde mit ihren Toten verfuhr. Aber
wenn dem Indizienbeweis in historischen Fragen iiberhaupt irgendein
Wert beizumessen ist, so haben wir vorauszusetzen, dass es wie bei den
Steppenvolkern Zentralasiens geschah : die Toten wurden ausgesetzt etc.”
The Gatha-Gemeinde is a “construction”; a reference to people of the
Asiatic steppes is no “proof by means of circumstantial evidence.” What
he has in mind is a deduction from “historical analogy,” in which case
the gatha ought to be “peoples of the steppes” instead of a collection of
odes. Against his sentence “Das Problem des Todes war gewissermassen
nicht vorhanden, weil die Frage des toten Korpers nie aktuell war” it
must be said that exposure is a more complicated procedure than burial.
Only where tribes, like the Massagetae of Herodotus, eat their grand
parents, is the “question of the dead body no longer actual.”

VIDEVDAD 747
In iae,205-220 and Arch.HistIran 31-40, I have published with illus
trations some material concerning old Iranian tombs. The monuments
cover the time from the immigration to Alexander the Great. The richer
tombs imitate houses, whether cut into the rock or built up in masonry; 8
the simple tombs are loculi, cut into rock, vertical or horizontal. It is
not the size of the tombs or the shape of the houses that are important
for the religious question, but their interior arrangement. The older
tomb-chambers were lavishly furnished, the bodies lying on a kline,
in Cyrus’ case a golden kline. In these chambers the tusnisaSo were
meant to feel comfort, to be saista (Vid.3). The last tombs of this type
are those of Cyrus and the unfinished tomb of Cambyses. With Darius
comes the change : the dead are put into tightly closed loculi or sarcoph
agi; they no longer need furnished chambers or any earthly posses
sions. Funerary customs belong to the things that change little. Changes
must have deep reasons. No external reasons can have brought about
a change between Cyrus’ and Darius’ reign, only a change of religious
conceptions. Darius no longer shared the religious beliefs of Cyrus. He
was a Zoroastrian.
Exposure was not the “classical” and no Zoroastrian custom, not even
an Iranian custom at all. Both, the pre-Zoroastrian and the Zoroastrian
Iranians buried. Exposure was a custom solely of the magi, as Herodotus
says, and in the oldest known ostotheke of Sakawand, we have the
astodan of Gomata the magus, killed at Sikayahvatis.
While no word in the gatha and the yasht refers to exposure, there
are two words referring to interment. The term tusnisad in Y/.13
describes the fravarti as sitting, living in the silence of their graves. And
the Zoroastrian notion is implied in the term for “resurrection” in Yt.
19,88, us.histan, which means “they rise up (from their graves).” The
records of exposure in Greek sources and Vid.1 clearly show how ex
posure spread and invaded Iran at the time of that chapter, the early
Arsacid period. This again is supported by archeological evidence, see
iae and Arch.Hist.lr. Exposure became finally adopted at the post
Christian, Atropatenian phase of the Arsacid empire, as attested by the
8 A great number, built in sundried bricks, and probably still containing the burials, have

ordinances of the Videvdad proper, which are not older than the first
century a.d. 9
Vid.6,44 gives rules for the arrangement of a daxma as place of ex
posure: they shall be made on high places, so that dogs and birds can
perceive them. Then follow prescriptions against parts of corpses being
carried away, in 50 a rule for the astodan, the ostotheke, in which the
bones are collected. There, they are called uzdana, and shall be made
so high that dogs, foxes, wolves cannot reach them, at the same time
they must be protected against rain. That is why they always have
rain-grooves around. The height is expressed by upari.spana etc., “too
high for a dog.” If possible, they must have a bedding of stone, gypsum
or at least of clay.
“daxma” is used for pyres, for the place of exposure, and for ossuaries
in the Pahl. inscriptions it mostly means the ossuaries. Originally it
meant “funeral pyre,” to Vdag- “burn.” It must come down from a
period when the Iranians cremated. A change of habitat may produce
a change from cremation to burial, and certainly cremation could not
have been kept up in scantily wooded countries like the Oxus and
Jaxartes region and the Iranian plateau. The people of IE. language in
Europe—language of course is not responsible for customs—practiced
originally interment. The Greeks went over to cremation after the
Dipylon period. Pliny says of the Romans, nh.vii,i 87 : “Ipsum cremare
apud Romanos non fuit veteris instituti, terra condebantur.” In Western
Europe cremation prevailed: the Romans did not notice interment any
longer with the Celts and Teutons. The Thracians, Lithuanians and
Borussians used both methods simultaneously.
Nyberg, to whom Vid.i is the history of Zoroastrian mission, says 322:
“daxma heisst ‘Scheiterhaufen.’ Religionsgeschichtlich liegt die Sache
so: Der Zoroastrismus findet ubermachtig [6%, only in Caxra, where
(297) “heidnisches Wesen noch unter der Asche glimmt,” though no
fire is recorded] Leichenverbrennung vor, und schliesst, da er sie nicht
ausrotten kann, ein Kompromiss: er behalt die Form des Scheiterhau
fens bei, verwandelt sie aber in einen Ort fur die Aussetzung der
Leichen.” Such methods he calls “realpolitisch.” Between a daxma, e.g.
9 al-BaidawI, nizam, in his description of Fars, gives an amazingly good observation: “The tombs, gor, of the pre-Muhammedan Persians are of three types: (i) in caves, ghar, and daxma’s cut out on the mountains; (2) below the mountains, with so many stones heaped upon them, as if the\ were mounds, tall; (3; sepulchral urns, xunb, hidden in the ground.”



VIDEVDAD 749
at Ray, Karachi, Bombay—a high circular wall with fan-like compart
ments for the bodies around a central pit—or the older simpler form
on the rock above Istakhr, and a pyre, there is not the remotest formal
similarity. It is a general and necessary phenomenon that shapes and
names of things live on even after their essence has changed. Nature
needs thousands of years to bring a new form to its own perfection,
always with some atavistic characters. Railways needed a hundred years,
motor cars less, to detach themselves from the stagecoach. If places for
exposure are called daxma, and ossuaries uzdana, both originally
“funeral pyre, pile,” and if the uzdana are small imitations of tombs,
the unavoidable conclusion is that the older form of interment was
succeeded by the younger exposure, and that a change in the constant
and immovable customs has happened.
I assume that the great stalactite cave in the mountain behind Bisha
pur, with the colossal statue of Shahpuhr I, cut from a stalactite, is his
daxma, and that the statue is the one mentioned in the Bishapur in
scription. Xusrau I decrees in his testament, Pahl. Texts 1,55: “ka en jan
ac tan e man yudtak bet en taxt e man apar darat u pat ’sp’vvr barat u
pat ’sp’vvr be nihat, when this soul will have departed from my body,
lift this bed of mine, carry it to ’spovar, and put it down there.” The
name is that of the old city of Ctesiphon, see under ‘Harvatat.’ Anosa
zaS, son of Xusrau II, says to his mother Shirin in Firdausi: “Ne me
prepare pas un daxma et un trone et de longues ceremonies, donne-moi
une tombe chretienne! II ne faut ni camphre ni ambre. . . .” Tabari in,
1833, telling of the fights that preceded the end of al-Muhtadi in a.d.
870: “The body of abu Nasr b. Bogha had been thrown into the pit of a
qanat, was not discovered at once, and was embalmed with 300 mithqal
(1,3 ko) of musk and 600 mithqal of camphor. After the burial the
Turks broke a thousand swords over the tomb: they do that when one
of their sayyids is dead.”
In Vid.3,1-13, the world is graded in first- to fifth-best, saista, loci.
The principle is that of Vid.1. The fifth-comfortable locus is “verily
where small and large cattle urinate most.” 3,8: the second-uncom
fortable, a.saista, is “verily where most corpses are buried, nikante,”
that means, where interment is general. 3,9: third-a.saista, “where most
daxma uzdeza kryante, funeral pyres are piled up,” that is where crema

tion is general. The sequence is not a grading of antipathy but for
purposes of mnemonics. shows which thoughts may have
caused the bias against cremation and interment: “where most funeral
piles are piled up, uzdeza uzdista, upon which corpses are laid, there
is the deva, the devayasna etc.” At this late period, beginning of our
era, the deva are mainly demons of diseases. “As if the deva would eat
and vomit at these places, as you men stew meat . . the rest is so
faulty that it cannot be translated. 57: “etesva daxmesva hambavanti
axtisca garnusca, round these daxma (here = pyre or cemetery) assem
ble (various kinds of) diseases.” Burial places apparently were con
sidered as unsanitary. 58: “Round these daxma the worst people
assemble after sunset,” to which Nyberg remarks, 32 “offenbar um
dort Thaten der Finsternis zu treiben.” Today it is a Persian custom to
sit down, on summer evenings, for instance at Tadjrish above Teheran,
on the desolate cemeteries, as in Europe in a cafe, only one brings
one’s picnic, usually with some rakki or an opium pipe. Other “deeds
of darkness” have not come to my knowledge. The sight of the tombs
enhances the pleasure of being alive. On the contrary, when in August
1916 1 sometimes walked by night, at 120° F., over the cemetery in front
of my house in Mossul, a Turkish sentry came asking me not to do it,
not even armed, on account of aghwal, devs.
F/V/.8,73-81—see under ‘Industries’—is an ordinance telling how to
purify fire used for cremation, nasu.paka. The adj. is spelled nasus
pacaya in Vid.1.16, an artificial sandhi formation for +nasu.paciya. Bar
tholomae and Nyberg translate the noun by “(die unsiihnbare Siinde,
die im) Kochen von Leichen(teilen besteht).” The meaning cremation
is indeed “fiber jeden Zweifel erhaben” as Nyberg says, banishing the
doubt into a footnote “So auch die Pfi., die indessen in 1,17 das kochen
von wilden Tieren [small ones of the genus ‘dog’] vorauszusetzen
scheint.” “Teile” parts, added for improvement, makes things worse
because it creates the impression that the “cooking” was done for eat
ing, and thus evokes the idea of cannibalism.
The fault is Germ, “kochen” which means “in water,” as the proverb
says “es wird fiberall mit Wasser gekocht.” Yr.8,58 rules that only white
and black sheep, but none piebald, are permitted to be sacrificed, paca
yan, to Tistriya, and that Anaryans and bondmen (Bartholomae’s
“Schurken und Dirnen”) shall not partake of this “roast.” The sacri

fice was done directly on the fire and, of course, the fire was not defiled
by roasting meat on it, an idea which seems to have caused the trans
lation “to cook.” The Iranians pak-, “bake,” bricks and pots, cf. zmani.
pacika-fire; the Romans panem coquunt and make coctile, but nobody
translates “to cook bread” and to make “cooked bricks.” In NP. aspaz
“the cook,” pak- is generalized because as < OP. *as#ra, Med. astra
“porridge, grit” was the primitive, national food (see under ‘Hospitium’
and ‘Industries’).
Vid.i 6,iy, a revolting passage, says: “(as bad) as if he would fra
nezam pacat his own son’s corpse, nasum,” Wb.: “zu Brei verkochte,
das Fett dem Feuer darbrachte”; “neza, Klumpen, formlose, breiige
Masse” exists only in Bartholomae’s imagination; fra is not preverb of
pacat, but first element of the compound fra.nezam, neza = spit, hence
“to roast on a spit,” as the Pahl. transl. has it. There are dozens of such
compounds with fra-, and already in the Rgveda roasting on the spit is
especially appreciated. The fat is not “dem Feuer dargebracht,” the
father does not skim off a sauce from the corpse of his son, cooked into
pulp, but fra.bar- means simply the dropping of fat into the fire when
roasting on a spit.10 The Videvdad is a bad product, but not as bad as
the translations make it.
It orders that the nasu.paka “cremator” shall be killed, ava janeta
(formed after MP. ojatan); the dista (fem.) “pile” shall be pulled
down, apa barayan, also the uzdana, ossuary. The fire shall be extin
guished at once, but be saved by nine times rekindling one branch at
the other, and be brought to the cult place, datiya gatu, of a Bahram
fire, dista, fem., is not a “big cauldron (Kessel)” (Wb.) —another
wrong translation caused by “cooking,” ruled out by the verb apa
barayan alone—but “funeral pile.” The neutr. dista, too, in F/i.8,92
is not “kettle,” but a pile of wood, of a charcoal-stack.
The provisions are rigorous, such as could be carried into effect only
in regions under full control. They show therefore that cremation,
and by analogy interment, had not yet completely disappeared from
Iran as late as the beginning of our era.

THE FIFTEEN COUNTRIES OF VIDEVDAD I
SUGDA AXD GAVA
Sughd, on the gold carrying Zarafsan, between Oxus and Jaxartes,
is a country known through all times. Its main towns are Samarkand
on the middle course, and Bukhara in the delta, where the river dis
appears in sand. The overwhelming beauty of this country is shown in
Rickmer’s book The Duab of Turkestan, Cambridge 1913. The name
may have been originally that of a river, see Bartholomae, Ar.Forsckg.
1, 1 1. In OP. it is an ethnic.
The name gava appears twice. The old town of Isfahan bears it: Gr.
Gabai, Pahl. g’b, Pars, gov, Gr. TH (in Ka'ba I.32); BPars. gd, adj.
gavik-wine in Xusr.Ret.; Arab. Djay—Isfahan would be *gava mada.
sayana.
Tomaschek11 identified gava suySa.sayana with Ho of the Wei.su,
in a.d. 437, which again is Kwei-suang, Arab, kusaniyya near Samar
kand. Istakhri 323 calls this “heart of Sugd,” cf. Vid.1,3 “the winter’s
heart”; ibn Hauqal transfers this designation, 370 and 374, to ‘nahr
Qay,’ a canal mentioned by Tabari 11, 1422 and 1441. Markwart, there
fore, identified gava with nahr Qay. But in Tabari, the editor, D. H.
Muller, has emended, against the Mss., fy of the texts into qy on the
strength of the spelling in ibn Hauqal, as W. Barthold has shown, and
the true name is, as in Ydqut 111,936, nahr Fay, mod. Nar.pai. Thus gava
suySasayana, Ho of the Weisu, seems to have disappeared as name in
pre-islamic time.
The name seems to form the second element in the comp. Abargo,
Bargo < ‘apar.gava; the nisba abarqo’i in an inscription of the Seljuq
period proves that the h in Arab. Abarguh is not etymological. The
meaning seems to be “above the low land, hollow ground,” viz. the
depression of a salt-lake east of the town. The Pahl.Vid. explains gava
by “dast, plain”; Darmesteter compared Goth, gawi “Gau”; at any rate
it is not gav- cow. The meaning was unknown already in antiquity, the word a mere name.
Samarkand, Mapa/ccmSa, is mentioned in classic literature only in
the context of Alexander s campaigns as capital of Sogdiana. Curtius
gives the circumference of the town as 70 stadia, i.e. 8 miles—reliable
11 ZentraUnat. Studten i: Sogdiana, p.96, SB.Ak.d.W. Wien 87,160.



VIDEVDAD 753
as all measurements of the bematists—which would be a circle of two
and a half miles diam., a very large area for a town of that antiquity,
enough for about 150,000 inhabitants.
Gr.Bdh., chapt. “Rivers”: “xvajand rot pa miyan e sumarkand u far
gan be savet, the river of K ho] and (Jaxartes) flows forth between
Samarkand and Farghana.” The correspondence of sumar.kand and
Gr. mara.kanda (Sogd. kand = town) makes one think of Vsmar-,
mar-.
As the Videvdad begins with gava, so the Sahr.Er. begin with Samar
kand, which Kaika’us started and Siyavuxs completed, and with a
temple founded by KaiXusrau, in which a complete copy of the Awesta
written by Vistasp’s order was kept. Against Markwart’s opinion, this
legend is entirely unhistorical, as is the similar legend of the foundation
of the aSar farnbag near Tos and Nlsapur, which Vistasp is said to
have “rediscovered by Zoroaster’s order” on mount hvarnahvant in
Xvarizm, and transferred to mount Royen.
With the canonization by Shahpuhr II of the Awesta text in Awestic
script in a.d. 360, all oral tradition ceased, and when in a.d. 490 the
original of the Ayatkariha e Sahriha was written, the authors could no
longer imagine that things had ever been different, and projected the
conditions of their time into the high past. Whatever one may think
of the tradition of the Awesta or parts of it before it was first written
down under Volagases I about a.d. 50, but a written Awesta—or an
Awesta at all—at the time of Vistaspa is as impossible a notion as a
New Testament in the lifetime of Christ.
The Khwarizmians began their legendary history with Siyavuxs and
ascribed to him, as Birum tells, an era with the epochal year 1300 b.c.
This may be a legendary expression for the historical fact that Mithra
dates the Great had introduced in 120-110 b.c. the Seleucid era, which
was used in Khwarizm and Sughd till the end of the 10th century a.d.
In the Shahnamah, Siyavuxs takes refuge in Turan and marries there
the daughter of the Vesak Plran, cf. Benveniste, bsos vii, 275b This
legendary motif has historical precedents in the Arsacid period and
seems to be the variant of an original story in which Siyavuxs was a
Tura. This is suggested by the Armenian form of the name savars,



VIDEVDAD
754
which corresponds to Sak.-Soghd. *syava.rsan, not to Ir. syava.rsan. 1 "
But the value of this observation is impaired by the other one, that
Armen, savars can also be Akk.-Aram. ’hsvrs, ahsiwarsu, i.e. xsaya.rsa,
Xerxes, and the names may have been contaminated like Arm. Azdahak
and Ir. Astyages.13

Before the vague term “Eastern Iran” came into use, one had accepted
Bactria as “home of the Awesta,” without scrupling at the fact that this
name appears only once in the Awesta at as late a place as Vid.v.
baxSim, acc. The authenticity of this form was not questioned till
much later. It is not (Nyberg) “a younger,” but an “inverse” form,
reconstructed from MP. ba^l under the wrong assumption 1 < S. Ben
veniste, bsos vii,290, calls it “revetu du deguisement avestique.”
The genuine form of the OP. inscriptions, ba^tris, is rendered in the
Elam, versions in two ways: pa.k.tnr.ri.s, i.e. baxtris, the Median form,
and pa.k.si.s, i.e. *bax$ r
is, ‘baxsis, the OP. form. The analogy of Aw.
duySaire, i.e. ‘duySri (against OP. *dux#ris in El. tu.k.si.s) suggests a
third form *bax#ri, which must be the indigenous one because it alone
leads to baxh It is attested in Yr.19,14 by the name of a mountain “haca
garayo vax^rike,” which is not (Wb.): “anscheinend vrddhi aus einem
vaxSra,” but +bax#rika, the “Bactrian mountain,” with (normal) x^
for x$, and v for b as in Skr. vahlika, beside bahlika.14
Later, Bactria is called baxl i bamik “the matutinal,” and in Bactria
lies Bamiyan < *bamikan, famous for its colossal Buddhas. In the
Videvdad Balkh has the epithet rdwa.drafsa “with lifted banners.”
Nyberg 15: “Erhobenes Banner bedeutet im Munde des Awesta keinen
Ruhm, im Gegenteil ... da ist es nun um so merkwiirdiger, dass die
Fravasi ... in Yt. 13,37 entfaltete Banner tragen.” The origin of the
flag is the totem or idol of the tribe, carried into battle, round which
the warriors swarm; thus it was everywhere since remote prehistory,
and everywhere and always it was the highest glory. That is why men
are called to the colors, swear “Fahneneide,” or else “hold up the flag’
of something to the present day. Iranian flags are first mentioned in
12 Cf. Hubschmann, Arm.Gramm. 61, and Markwart, uge 1,503. 13 Book Tobit, Lat. 14,6, Gr. 14,4-5: Aha^verus, Aavyjpos i.e. 'hsvrs, Xerxes, and Nebuchadnezzar destroy Assur. 14 In Atharvaveda v and Mahabharata; Kautilya (4th century b.c.?) has bahlika, ethn. to bahl; also Pantahjali, in second century b.c.

the Nabunaid chronicle: after the conquest of Babylon, the “warriors
of Gutium,” i.e. the Median garrison under Gobryas, take over the
protection of the temples, “the sentinels of Gutium went round Esakila,
(but) no banner, simanu ( = drafsa) entered it,” namely because Cyrus
did not permit a desecration of the sanctuaries. On the alleged “steer
banner,” the Iranian imperial standard, compared in Y.10,12, with a
drunkard, see under ‘Homa.’
Benveniste aos 49 s interpreted the epithet bara.hvarna of Vrthragna

king comes, 30 years of age, with uncounted banners and lifted arms.”
But the banners of Balkh are a most peculiar case. Yaqut, mud).iv,
8iyf. describes them s.v. naubahar: “the naubahar has been built before
the time of the Ashkan (Arsacids) by the Barmacids who were idola
ters, butparastan (i.e. Buddhists), like the kings of China, India and
Kabul, who went there in pilgrimage. Inside it was hung with silks,
long banners were on the famous dome, qubba, called al-ustun, a hun
dred cubits in diameter and a hundred cubits high, with colonnades all
around and 350 cells for monks. The banners stream in the wind as far
as Tirmidh, a distance of twelve farsakh.” Mas'udi, mur.\x,$, says
“built by Manucihr” and mentions the “green banners,” over 100 cubits
long and made so that they do not tear in the wind.
Buddhist pilgrims—S. Beal, Buddh.Records 1,43k—describe the town
Little Rajagriha outside of Balkh with the monastery nava.sangharama,
where there was a figure of Buddha, of the Vaisravana deva, and
Buddha’s washing basin and broom; to the north of the monastery was
a stupa, 200 feet high, to the southwest a vihara; “many years have passed
since they were founded.”
H. Rawlinson, jrgs 1872, 510, had recognized in naubahar a nava
vihara “New Monastery,” and “ustun” in Yagut is “ustub,” the stupa.
Since an early period the whole East of Iran had been converted to Buddhism. In the Karnamak and the Shahnamah, Kabul and Balkh
are the typical representatives of butparastih. MP.NP. butparast “idola
tor” means Buddhist because they worshipped images, idols, Arab, as
nam. Ya'qub ibn Laith sent the caliph in Samarra “idols from Kabul.”

Even if Aw. bud > NP. but [TPahl. bvt, pi. bvt’n, BPars. but-dev] in
Vid. 19 (Zoroaster’s temptation) and bu8i in Vid. 11,19, were genuine
Aw. words, yet in the passages where they appear the notion of Buddha
is behind them. Peroz, brother of Shahpuhr I, who favored Mani, repre
sents on his Kushan coins Buddha enthroned with the legend “bvld’
yzdty, the divine Buddha.” The epithet rSwa.drafsa means the banners
of the Buddhist temple, and designates ba^Si, be. MP. baxl, as a Bud
dhist town, just as the scepsis and hyperscepsis characterize Nisaya
and Raga as Greek towns, at the end of the second century b.c. So old
was the nava vihara whose priests and mutawalli were the Barmacids
who ruled the Islamic world at the glorious days of Baghdad. A mem
ber of this house, a full thousand years later, was the fair ‘Arib, to whom
belongs the anecdote told under ‘Vehviya.’
NISAYA
Nisaya > Nisa, adj. nisan on the great seal of the andemankaransalar,
means “settlement” and is a common name, differentiated by epithets.
There was one in Khurasan, in Hamadan, Kirman, Bamm, Fars etc.
The one in Hamadan, mentioned already by the Assyrians and in the
Behistun inscription, is the most famous, as the pasture of the Nesaean
horses, the Nrjaraiov TreSiov. But the Videvdad means Nisa in Khurasan,
for, else, the main country of the whole list, Parflava, would be missing.
The definition “between (miyan i) Marw and Balkh” shows that it was
the place called Nsai mianak by Moses Chor., and this again is Isidorus’
av\S>v Hapdav ' Nicra/c 770X1? evda /3acn\iKal roufml, '’EXX'rji'e? Se
Nuraiav Xeyovcriv, also Pliny’s “Nisaea, Parthyenes nobilis, ubi Alexan
dropolis a conditore,” NH. vi,ii4, and Strabo’s Nesaia.
In this Greek town, alias Alexandropolis, with the tombs of the early
Arsacids, orthodoxy did not root deeply: Ahriman had created scepsis,
vimanahya, gumanih. The town does not lie on the straight line be
tween Marw and Balkh, but, as Isidorus accurately indicates, east of
Ustuwa, Gr. Astauene, where ibn Hauqal, MuqaddasI, Zakariya Qaz
wini (11,311) and Yaqut put their Nisa i Khurasan, between Saraxs
and Abeward, Apavartike; today Kucan near the sources of the Atrek.
It is wrong to look out, as Tomaschek and Markwart do,15 for Nisa
farther east at Maimana-Yahudiyya, because the support, Ptolemy’s
15 Hist. Topographie v. Persien 1,74, a valuable work, but which ought to be worked over.



VIDEVDAD 757
Nisaia in Margiane, does not hold: Ptolemy doubles and shifts a lot of
names in those regions, among them the Nisaioi, because he worked
into his map materials of Alexander’s time and others of Nero’s time,
when the Hyrcanians negotiated with Rome. The remark “between
Marw and Balkh” is no exact topical indication—no other one occurs
but a kind of gloss, an interpretation of the epithet miyanak, indispen
sable because there were many Nisaya. Miyanak alone occurs also as
placename, cf. Arab. Wasit “Middletown,” called so allegedly because
it was founded at equal distance from Kufa, Basra and Ahwaz; but in
fact the name “Wasit al-qasab” existed before the Muhammedan foun
dation. The points to which the situation of a town may be referred are
arbitrary.16 Nisaya was the capital of Parthia before the foundation of
Aparsahr = Nisapur, important for the date of the poem.
HAREVA
Hareva vishrzana: a gloss in Pahl.Vid.1,9 says: “vys.sBKVN.Ih (i.e.
called vishil because), while we keep our [vishil] for a length of nine
nights and a month, they abandon the house, xanak, at [once, or: after
a span of] time and go away,” thinking of the vishil custom, which the
Bdh. defines by “they abandon a house in which a person died.” But
the epithet of the town expresses the quality by which the god made
Hareva ramaSati, and this explanation neither fits such a meaning nor
is linguistically acceptable.
Bartholomae’s etymology, based on the gloss, slightly modified by
Duchesne: “Ar. ‘vik'.sarg'hana, with k's > ks > s > sh” would involve
that “house-abandoning” was a pre-Iranian custom, but the gloss does
not imply that vis meant “house,” vis, and the connotation “abandon,”
not attested in OIr., is not that of the simplex, but results from preverbs,
e.g. MP. br’ sBKVN = be.hil, Arm. apasarjan “divorce, separation.” The
simpl. \ hrz-, NP. histan, hil-, is the verb for outpouring water, used
e.g. in Vid.6,2 and 3 for irrigating fields, in Vid.5,51 with upa for be
sprinkling a daxma, in Mr. 108 for the watering of Homa; it means
also “filtering.” The spade of the mirab—see under ‘ApamNapat’—is
kastram patishrzanam, where sh results from sandhi as in patishvara
(see under ‘Mada-Parsa’). vishrzana is the same case: not “vis, clan,”
16 P. Scheil, Ann. de TufydtiNinip 11,48, remarks to Isidorus’ explanation of the name Phaliga (half, middle) on the Euphrates, as peaottopi kov: ‘‘artihciel; ll n’est pas de locahte qui ne se trouve au milieu d’un parcours ou d’une section de parcours imaginaire.”



758 VIDEVDAD
but the distrib. prev. vi plus sarg’hana, meaning “distribution of
water.” 17
Hareva is one of the Iranian provinces richest in water, and the archaic
character of the epithet shows that its irrigation system was developed
in high antiquity. If the epithet referred to the town itself, it would
mean a dividiculum aquae, as ibn Hauqal 298f. describes in the town
Zrang: “three canals in the inner city, together strong enough to drive
a mill, fall into two large basins, haud, in the Great Mosque, and are
distributed from there to the sardab (lit. ‘cold-water’, basements) of the
houses.”
Ahriman’s counter-creation, saraska and driwika, may both be dis
eases, the first one perhaps locusts. Only the mistake about vishrzana
causes the Pahl. transl. and Bdh. to interpret the words as an unor
thodox bewailing of the dead.”
West of Herat lay the old town Posang, with a famous bridge,
founded according to Sahr.Er. §13 by Shahpuhr I, but indeed much
older: posang < uposanhva “matutinal,” cf. Y/.I9,i: “The Hara hems
in the frapiya dahyus uposanhvasca, the western and eastern countries.”
VEKRTA
Tomaschek identified vaikrta or vekrta with Ptolemy’s Olxdp$V <;>
tribe OlxapSai, vi,i6; though he puts them in Serica, the names are
evidently Indo-Iranian. S. Levi, ]As. 1925,1,67, compared Vaikrtika in
the catalogue of Mahamayuri. The name resembles the nn.ppr. Ved.
vaikrna and Ir. u.ma.ki.ir.tu in Sargon, 8th Camp. I.44 (beside m/wa.ki.
ir.tu). The topic name is not formed with vayu “aeolian formation”;
Ved. vikrta is “modified, altered,” also “malformed, maimed” and the
like. The Pahl.Vid. says “k’pvl, Kabul” for it. I tried previously to find
the country in Baxirz < ‘vata.hrza, or in Jajirm, if = gagirm <
vaikrma. But there is another way.
The epithet duzaka.sayana, Wb. “home of the hedgehog,” Pahl.
transl. “dus-sayak, with bad shade”—impossible as good gift of Ahura
Mazdah—“thus because the shade of the trees, others say of the moun
tains, is bad for the body.” This is meaningless, but confirms the spelling
17 Arm. apasarjan < *apasarzana would show “Lautausgleich,” s after i prevailing over h
after a. The religious term vishil is *vishrz with separative instead of distributive meaning of the prev. vi.



VIDEVDAD 759
with s, though half of the Mss. have s. Vsl- (med.), “to lie, camp” has
the participles sayana, Ptolemy’s %rjva in Marw, and sayamna, %rjfuva,
today Simnan, near Damghan. sayana is better fit for the name of a
country, sayana for a town. But the elegant variation duzaka.Sayana
against arya.Sayana (Yt.xd), suyda. Sayana, vrkana.Sayana (Vid.), is
very doubtful. In all cases the first elements are names of tribes, and one
must read gv for dv, in Ars. script similar, in Pars, script identical:
+gozaka.sayana. *gozaka < gav.aza- “cow-driver, puncher.”
Gozagan is the district between Herat, or Marw-rot and Bal^. In the
list of kings subject to Ardashlr I, ibn Khurdadhbih 39, is also the
Gozagan xudah. In the Museum of Lahore, made famous by Kipling’s
Kim, I once found a kufic inscription, the oldest Arabic inscription from
India, on the building of a well by a Gozagani.
Towns of Gozgan were Maimana-Yahudiyya and Suburgan, Sibirgan,
80 miles west of Balkh, which can be traced in. antiquity:
Tab.Peut.: parthona lxx scobaru lv carsania
Ravenn. scobarum. carsamir
This is a straight road from the plain of Mashhad-Tos, av\a>v HapOav
of Isidorus, to mod. Kism < *krsm in BaSa^san, about 185 miles SE
of Balkh. The total of 125 par. is about 15 par. short. From BaSaxsan
comes the lapislazuli, and a Latin author says “Oscobares ubi laser nas
citur.” On Ptolemy’s map the name is disfigured to ‘JLcrTofiapa, be
tween Bactra and Maracanda, mod. Shibirgan. The Arab geographers
write sa/ub-, sub-, suf- and a/usp-; the original initial was sp-, hence
+spurgan from Aw. sprya. Syr. sbvrqn translates x^kin/; and means
“steel” like Aw. sprya ahena, “iron of Suburgan,” see under ‘Indus
tries.’
Ahriman’s counter-creation is the fairy Xnan#ati, apparently a non
Iranian name, which the Pahl. transl. renders by “kamakih, desire,”
adding “an e uzdesparastih, of idol-worship,” perhaps because the com
mentator knew that the country was Buddhist, see under ‘Aneran
Turan.’
RUVA
Wb. translates ruva by “Mesene,” because the Pahl. Vid. explains it by
mys’n.18 This may be caused by the awkward transcription of urva by
18 Conform with its wrong translation of awistar by apar.manisnlh, expl. “because the mys’n’y, Mesenians, apar.manend,” see under ‘Aneran-Turan.’

(Aw.) u + (Pahl.) 1 + (Aw.) e, which suggests an association with
Ule, Eulaeus, river of Susa, and (other variants) with ’vld’, which the
Sahr.Er. §23 enumerate between Slevak-Seleucia and Bawer-Babylon.
Markwart, Cat.Prov.Cap., believed this to be Orha-Urfa. But the ethnic
of this name is spelled ’vlh’y in Shahpuhr’s Kaba inscription, and ’vld’
means in reality the old Sumerian town Uruh-Warqa, written ’vlk’ (not
’vId’), famous in Hellenism as seat of Babylonian astronomy, Ptolemy’s
Orchoe, Ezra 4,9 ’rkvy’, arkevaye, Syr. ’vrk, still in a.d. 775 mentioned as
bishopric beside Kaskar. Ruva is no western country.
The name must be compared with ruvaSa in Yt.19,67 both connected
by the same surname puruvastra “rich in pastures.” For the unexplained
-Sa cf. Yt. 5,45 Usa, YAi3,i32 UsaSa; also vesarvesaSa. It is Ptolemy’s
'Pov8a, mod. Ruy i xv^> district on the way from Kohistan (Ka’In)
to Herat, with the towns Ruy, Zozan and Khargird (also Farrgird).
The name seems to be an appellative, cf. Ruyan in Tabaristan. Ctesias
seems to render the same name by "Tpj8a, with j8 for v, the place where
Cyrus defeated the Medes, at the frontier between Media and Persis,
hence perhaps “Great and Little Urd,” not far from mod. Izad^vas
’IcraKovs.
The counter-creation of Ahriman is “aya awistara, evil raiders”; the
country was a border land and the raiders came apparently from the
South, the frontier of Kirman and Fars, not yet belonging to the Arsacid
kingdom. XNINTA
The epithet vrkana.sayana determines Xninta as Hyrcania. There
fore the name can be identified with that of the tribe XPW$°1 and the
river xaph'Sas in Ptolemy vi,9. Since he makes its mouth the NE point
of Media, the river must be the westernmost river of Hyrcania, the Gur
gan. Tacitus, Ann.x1,8, calls it Erindes, i.e. + Chrindes, and says “Dahas
Ariosque disterminat,” speaking of the fights between the Atropatenian
Vardanes and the Hyrcanian Gotarzes. Arii, though this may be ’Apeloi
= Hareva as well as vAptoi = arya, means here Iranians, at a time when
Dahistan did not belong to the empire. Either r replaces n in Greek, or
in the Videvdad n is disfigured from r. The Pahl. transl., too, explains
yn^n as a river: rot e gurgan-manisnrh, “on which the Hyrcanians
dwell.”



VIDEVDAD 761
In old times Vrkana and Dahistan were the heritable country of the
Vefikan, see under ‘Vehviya.’ In the Behistun inscription it belongs to
the satrapy Partfava, whereas Marw was part of Bactria. Scylax had
mentioned the country, but it became well-known to the West only
through Alexander and more so through Antiochus the Great, at the
end of the third century b.c. and again in the first century a.d., when
Hyrcania as an independent kingdom entered into diplomatic relations
with Rome, cf. ami iv,63f. It never seems to have included Mazandaran,
but did include Komisene on the plateau : Damghan-Shahrud. Thus the
western frontier was a north-south line continuing the East coast of the
Caspian Sea. In the NE it bordered first on the Turcoman steppe, then
on Marw. harahvatis
Harahvatl, Ved. sarasvatx, is the name of a river; it seems that the
Indo-Aryans brought it with them about 1500 b.c. from their original
home and gave it to the country in which they settled for a while—as
did the Saka in about no b.c.—before going down into India. The name
appears also in Media, imported by the Medes, as araquttu, in the Nim
rud tablet of TiglathPileser III, 728 b.c. Its MP. form is Ra^vaS, later al
ruxxaJ.
The area at the mouth of the river had been cultivated since the end
of the Stone Age, and the region resembles in formation and climate the
Duab of the Oxus and Jaxartes. The southern delta has not been cul
tivated in historical times; the Iranian legend places its desolation in the
high antiquity of Frahrasya. Arachosia is the theater of the old Krsaspa,
the later Rustam legend.
The topical name harahvatis has been attested since the time of
Darius; the name of the inhabitants was Qafxavato1, OP. for ‘samana,
to sama > Sam, cf. Grdr. §282. The Samanids claim to descend from
a Saman xuda. Vivana, the Vefik, was satrap of the province under
Darius; Sena, of the memorial list of Yt. 13, one of the first followers of
Zoroaster, was according to the Awdlha Sag. a “bustik, of Bust” in Ara
chosia, a town founded “while Vistaspsah established the religious
doctrine at the Frazdan,” Sahr.Er. The country is the vast river basin
of the Hilmand, Afghanistan south of the Hindukush, with the Hamun
lake as discharge basin. The mod. name of the river is old hetumant,

“with many dikes,” for irrigation and against inundations, hetu may
belong to Vha-, hi-, “to tie to a line,” cf. the Arab, terms for canals
and dams: habl “rope,” khatt “line, groove,” khait “thread”; as OP.
yuviya “canal,” 01 . yavya “river” may belong to Vyu-.
The old name of the Hamun is Kansavya, see under ‘Last Judgment,’
a name derived from *kansu- of unknown meaning. Hamun is appell.
“flat plain,” zamin i hamvar, without elevations or depressions. Thus it
is used in Ayat\.Zar. §19, not as I formerly believed as n.pr.: “in the
white forest, arus.arzur, and Marw, where there is no high mountain
nor a deep lake, but on this dast e hamun, we will fight!” Hence,
hamun is OIr. hamagona.
From the lake rises Mt. Usidam, today Koh i Xwaja, see under ‘Hvar
nah.’ The modern delta at the northern end of the lake is called Miyan
Kangi, i.e. antara.kanha, in Yt. 19,4 enumerated under the names of
mountains. In an old diary I had noted: “kang designates an island in
Sistan.”
The Hamun has a much lower-lying escape basin, a remarkable
geographical feature, the gaud i Zirih, a name in which zrayo, zranka
survives. This escape is the Aw. frazdanu in Frhg.Ev.4,g and Y/.5,io8,
where Vistaspa prays. Duchesne §208: “Skr. fra.dha- ‘deplacer d’un
lieu dans l’autre,’ plus danu-,” “running water” gives a name which fits
this surplus basin as perfectly as vejah the communication between Sary
kamysh and Caspian. It is Ptolemy’s <t>pa£,ava, Rav. Parazene, Tab.
Petit, disfigured Tazarene from '<^apatpt]vr).
In Vtd.i, harahvatis and hetumant are mentioned side by side as two
countries, while the names are practically identical. The first has the
epithet “the lovely,” the second “revant hvarnahvant,” see under ‘Fra
varti’ and ‘Tistriya’; Pahl.transl. r’y’wmnd GDH.’wmnd, explained by
“^veskar u tu^sak menog sigistan, the dutiful and industrious genius
of Sigistan.” But at the turn of our era, in Isidorus, the country was
divided into three portions: (1) Zarangiane, the old “Sealand” Zranka
with the capital Zarin and the old fire-temple Korok, Karkoy; (2)
Sakastane, “Saka country” or Paraitakene, i.e. Rudbar, the long middle
course of the river; to these first two parts hetumant corresponds in the
Videvdad-, (3) Arachosia, at that time “White India,” with many towns,
among them Alexandria Arachosiae, near mod. Qandahar < Tovt'So
(faappwv, these two at that time with Greek constitution. This eastern



VIDEVDAD 763
part is harahvatis of the Videvdad. Not far east from there was the
frontier of the empire on the Bolan pass.
The Saka, coming from the Jaxartes, were allowed to settle in the
country about no b.c., and founded from there their vast but short
lived Indian empire. A mixture of foreign nations lived there already
before them. In the Videvdad the name of the Saka does not yet appear.
Ahriman’s counter-creation is interment of the dead, no reason to
assume that old-Zoroastrian missionaries fought there against this cus
tom. In Hetumant the counter-creation are locusts. I have met with
locusts in Slstan every time. As in Assur, they came from the desert in
the West. rag A
The Awesta mentions Raga only in the catechism of Yt. 19,18 and in
Vid.1,15, both passages as late as the Arsacid period. In Vid. the form

OP. form in Beh. §§32 and 36 is Raga, fem., El. rak.ka.n, Akk. ra.ga.’;

the d is inverse as in Gdy for Gay. Pahl. Vid. 1,15: l’k (or l’g), l’y, 1 ’, lyy;
Gr.Bdh. ldy.
If Raga were “das einzig sicher medische Land, das im Awesta
genannt wird” (Nyberg 342), it would say nothing, for the horizon of
the Awesta is the Seven Krsvar with arya.sayana as center, and this is
the concept of the pre-Zoroastrian passages as well as of the gatha. Raga
has two epithets: zara#ustris, which the Skr. transl. and the Pahl. gloss
“deh e ;yves, his own province” understand rightly as “belonging to
Zoroaster.” As discussed under ‘Spitama,’ it was Zoroaster’s home and
birthplace, Pahl.comm. to 1,15: zrtvst mn zk y’k YHWN.t, with the
variant pyt’k YHWN.t, “Zoroaster was or appeared from that place.” The
other old epithet #rizantus means “consisting of three zantu,” viz.
Kazwin, Ray and Kum. The term resembles Gr. rptx“tKe?, and there
is a possibility that Herodotus’ ’Apilavroi were in reality 9pit,avT0i.
A. V. W. Jackson saw in Raga zara#ustrls a “Papal See” on account
of the catechism of Yt. 19, which we have discussed under ‘Spitama.’



VIDEVDAD
764
Nyberg caught at that faulty idea, transforming it into a “Hauptmis
sionsstation” and connecting it with the “abolition of the kavi-title,”
see under ‘Kavi.’ He writes 298: “Der zara^ustrotama ersetzt den Titel
kavi. Im Westen konnte man dafiir einfach zara#ustra sagen. Offenbar
war zaradustrotama zuerst der hochste Herrschertitel der zoroastrischen
Gemeinde, dem zoroastrischen Stammeshauptling eigen und dem alten
kavi-Titel gleichwertig. . . . Die Ursache ist also nach allem zu urteilen
die, dass die Stammeshauptlinge sich statt dessen ‘der am meisten Zara
thustra-gleiche’ nannten.”
“Nach allem” is the remark in Wb. 579 to ca#ruratu in Y/.i9,i8:
“vier ratu, nicht fiinf wie die iibrigen Lander; Raga hatte keinen be
sonderen ratus dahyuma, dessen Stellung vielmehr mit der des zara
#ustrotamo in einer Person vereinigt ist, nach Markwart, Erdns. 1x2.”
As a matter of fact, the catechism says that Zoroaster himself kept the
office of ratus dahyuma, satrap. The catechism does not mention the
zara#ustratama at all. It was a wrong combination of Markwart who
wanted to explain the MP. title masmoyan in Tabaristan. The super
lative occurs only in post-Alexandrian passages, Vispr., Gasamb., Yt. 1
and 2, and in Y/.io,ii5; 19,18, in a series of adjectives which predicate
nothing. The medieval Parsism saw in zaraflustratama a yazata, head
of priesthood, an abstraction. Superlatives of names do not signify “com
ing up nearest to,” i.e. not-reaching, but the highest degree: at the side
of a zara^ustratama even Zoroaster would be small. Perhaps this unreal
word was made to express a notion like “most Zoroastrian of all.” The
town where one could simply say “zara#ustra” is Raga; but there,
Nyberg does not speak of a “Stammeshauptling” but of the “Oberhaupt
der Hauptmissionsstation” of the “Priesterstaat” which never existed.
Thus the zarathustrissimus becomes a clerical serenissimus.
Ahriman’s counter-creation is, in Vid.1,15, the “hyperscepsis, uparo.
vimanahya,” and, as in the case of Nisaya-AIexandropolis, with its
scepsis—this epithet describes Raga as the Greek town Europus.
CAXRA
Such a topical name, “wheel,” is unknown. The “hostile host on
chariots,” hena ca^ravati of the Ogmadeca has nothing to do with it,
see under ‘Krsvar.’ Lexicographers of the 16th century a.d. note carx



VIDEVDAD 765
as local name in Khurasan, but I have found no support for this name
in medieval or modern geographical literature.
But since the name must not be truly Awestic, and since Aw. caxra
changes to NP. carx, one may consider, especially as the name follows
upon Raga, whether it be Ctesias’ ZapKalov opo? called Zaypos since
Alexander’s time. Zagros is usually believed to come from the Ass. ex
pression hursani zaqruti “high mountains”; but this could only be true
if the Assyr. appellative had become a name in Iran, not a probable
assumption, and rather disproved by Ctesias ZapKalov. The only Iranian
assonant is mod. Jahrum, Shahnamah: Cihram, Karn. Art.: Carham,
but this is a canton in southern Fars, too small and too far aw’ay to be
identified with carx < caxra.
Ahriman’s counter-creation, cremation of the dead, points to a non
Iranian population.
VARNA
The very origin of the name varuna caflrugosa, as explained under
‘Krsvar’ is the heaven with its four cardinal points. The epithet ca 0ru
gosa is taken from Yt.5,33; from the same source comes the addition:
“Oretona was born there, the slayer of AziDahaka.” The two creations
of Ahriman are “intemperate climate and non-Aryan raiders,” the latter
pointing to a situation near a frontier.
The commentary of the Pahl.Vid. says (1) to varuna: “vrn, p‘n.
dvsxv’lgl dylm 19 ’yt mnv kyrm’n YMixvN.yt, Varn : patisxvargar delum;
one says kirman”; (2) to caffrugosa: “cahargos ’p.s iv-gvsyh hn’ ’yk:

four-cornered, because four roads exist therein ; one says : its capital has
four gates”; (3) to awistara, understood as MDM.manisnih, neighbor
hood: “mnv p‘N.dvsxv’lgl YMLLVN.yt dylm’y, mnv kylm’n YTviLLVN.yt
b’lyc, the one who says patisxvargar: delumaye, the Delumites; the one
who says kirman: the baric.”
Patisxvargar, the “mountains of patishvara” or Tabaristan, are the
slopes of the Alburz towards the Caspian Sea east of the Demawand;

highest Alburz, stretching west to the deep transversal valley of the
Safld rud, north of Qazwin. The western half of the plains, both banks
of the Safid rud, with the towns Rasht and Anzali, likewise virgin for
est, is Gelan.
The commentary gives two contradictory localizations: (i) varuna =
patisxvargar and as neighbors the Delumaye in the West. The reason
is: varuna is the land of the ©retona myth, to which the text alludes,
and in the later form of this myth, AziDahaka was imprisoned under
the Demawand. A further help was the formula of the Hosyanha myth
in Yt.5,22: duve #risve mazanyanam devanam varunyanamca (see
under ‘Aneran-Turan’), because Mazandaran, the country of the ma
zanya, is comprised in patisxvar.
(2) varuna = Kirman. The reason is: Kirman was believed to be the
country of AziDahaka, the kirm, i.e. worm, snake, and the late form
of the AziDahaka myth, the legend of Ardashir and the kirm, is
located there. The neighbors, Baric, are the inhabitants of the Koh i
Bariz, south of Kirman, see under ‘Mada-Parsa.’ In support of this
interpretation, there is a second Demawand in Kirman, the volcano
Koh i Tafdan, kansotafSra of Yr.19,3. 20 Gr.Bdh. 93: “Near Damindan
[on the SW slope of Tafdan] is an abyss, from which smoke always
rises . . . they say, a source of hell is in it.” The Bdh. adds a legend,
that the chasm accepts or rejects certain things thrown into it; a similar
story is told of the Frambar fire in Komis. Burhan, s.v. nosaSur: “Sal
miac pits are also on a mountain near Damindan, which belongs to
Kirman; on this mountain is a cave from which smoke rises that
solidifies.” Finally ibn al-Faqlh, 206: “Xvas (also spelled x^ac, i.e. OP.
hvadeci) in Kirman, at mount Dumbawand, with sulphur-mines, seven
farsakh from the mountain.”
Both sources of the commentary try to locate the ©retona myth in
the Arsacid country Varna, but contribute nothing to the location of that
country itself. On the contrary, if they can waver between Patisxvar
and Kirman, it was entirely unknown to them. ca#rugosa, as its mis
carried interpretations make only the more apparent, was not a surname
of the Arsacid country, but of the mythical varuna. But Ptolemy has a
town Ovapva placed between MopowSa-Marand and Na^ovcma-Nax

cawan, hence near the modern Russo-Persian frontier, and a tribe
OvapvLoi which he locates in Bactria. The source of the first name is
presumably some record of Pompey’s campaign, while the second
Bactrian name can only come through Eratosthenes from Alexander’s
time. With both names the Arsacid country Varna can be linked.
Ptolemy mentions also the of Gelan, which Pliny V148 calls
“the former Cadusii”; in Ctesias the Cadusii are typical representatives
of the Iranian aborigines. Strabo, confirmed by Syriac authors,21 de
scribes the customs of the Gelai as matriarchal. Such prevailed in Elam
through all her history, among the peoples on the Pontus—the Mossy
noikoi e.g. practiced the couvade—and as late as the beginning of our
era with the eastern Saka. Xenophon describes the Mossynoikoi living
in pile-dwellings, and such strange buildings are still the rule in modern
Gelan. Evidently the Gelae and Cadusii were aborigines. Strabo men
tions as his source Theophanes, who took part in Pompey’s campaign,
and Plutarch mentions the Gelae in his Life of Pompey, 35,5. Thus the
name became known to the western world through Pompey in 66 b.c.
The fact that Ptolemy mentions both, Varna and Gelae would be
no counter-argument against Andreas’ etymology: 22 “gel < varnya,
ethn.adj. of varna.” The phonetic change rn > 1 is entirely possible,
though so far without parallel; 23 v > g, after 130 b.c. (date of Videv
dad) and before 66 b.c., would be unexpectedly early: still in 20 b.c.
the second Awraman parchment shows v, not g, in ’OXevv&lpT] =
vrdancihr, and only in a.d. 50 we find Geopothros < ‘vevapu#ra and
Gundophares < vindat.hvarnah. The lack of similarity between gel and
varnya may be the reason that the Sasanian commentators failed to
recognize in it Ars. varna. On the other hand, the name of the Gelae
may be much older and may be a non-Iranian name. Arm. gail, etym. =
lupus, Avkos, corresponds to Ir. vrka “wolf”; in Georgian “wolf” is
mgeli. Like the Tapuri, Tabari of Tabaristan, who are Tabal, Tibareni
from the Pontus, the Gelae may be a people from the Pontus who
always bore that name. Thus the identity of Arsac. Varna and Gelan

depends solely on Andreas’ etymology and an assumed change of
sound, not otherwise attested, but perhaps right.
The commentary to Varna does not even think of Gelan, it does not
mention Mazandaran as country of the mazanya—though this belongs
to patisxvar—and so the name varna is not the cause for locating the
myths of ©retona and Hosyanha in Patisxvargar. In the Iranian epic
Hosyanha’s place was the hara brzati, on which also Mi#ra vuru
gavyuti dwelled, the mountain encircling the earth. The name Ario
barzanes, i.e. + (h)arabarzates, preserved in Orosius from a source of
Alexander’s time, proves by its Old Iranian form that the mountain
was called so long before Alexander, kafdovras in the history of Antio
chus II is Ta/Soiira? < gavyuti and came together with hara brzati.
This name of the Alburz is as old as Hvara and Patishvara, and was
given to it when the immigrating Aryans first saw the towering range
above Hvara.
Attempts to locate the old myths in that region are much later than
the transfer of the name Alburz, and this first transfer may have caused
the names Varna and Mazandaran to be fixed on the unconquered
northern slopes of the mountain. Mazandaran “country of the mazan
dar” superposes itself upon older Tapuri, Tabaristan. It was used as
appellative. I remember an anecdote in the Aghani, where someone says
to a duellist famous for challenging everybody “when you are dead you
still will challenge the mazandar, the devils!” The name has the form
of a comparative and may mean “worse than, outdoing the mazanya.”
UPA UDESU RANHAYA
Vid.\,\\9: upa aoSesu raqhaya yo asaro aiwyaxsayeinti. The second
half of the sentence is construed in MP.: yo as idafa resumed by awi,
replaces Aw. yahmi. The verb, from which awi must be separated,
stands either for sayanti “where the asara dwell,” or for xsayanti “where
they rule.”
Because upa aoSesu and upa sanake are opposed in Yt. 12,18 and 19,
Bartholomae assumed “source” and “mouth” of the river. For Vid.1,19
one needs a wider notion than “source,” for which the usual word
would be xan. Bartholomae compared aoSa to Lat. unda; as Ir. corre
spondent of Skr. udaka, udnah, it is better to read, as Tedesco proposes,
uSa, uSesu “on the waters.” The entire term is an analogy to vejo



VIDEVDAD 769
vahviya da#yaya and upa sanake ranhaya. All names belong to the Duab.
sanaka, too, correlates the region and the river. For its meaning there
are only two indications: it is opposed to uSa in parallel or contrast, and
it stands between usastare, dosatare, east, west and vima8ye “middle”
(of the earth). One may think of “bank,” perhaps a certain bank, like
cis and trans Jaxartem, as in Gr. Transoxiana, Arab, ma wara 1-nahr,
“beyond the river (of Balkh).” Cf. sadan, san-, Sogd. san “monter,”
Benveniste, JAs. 1936, 204^; Tedesco zii,11,39; Bailey bsos ix, 1,231: Iran,
base san-, sa-, in xvar.a.san “sunrise, east.” TPars. has ^var.paran “west,”
Xvar.asan “east,” -paran to 01 . parayanam “departure, occasus,” to para,
Germ. “Fahrt”; with aSa “downward” TPahl. aSapar, Pars, ewar “oc
casus, evening.” The opposition makes the signification of V san- “rise”
probable.
On the asara Vid.2,5 ( PiiZ ) says: “en ku.s daxsak e martoman andar
tan kirt estet, ac an ]ak petak: abarsnuva pasceta asara martiyakebyo,
those to whom this mark of mankind is made on the body, as is evident
from the passage: with the men without neck, without head.” Wb.
misinterprets both, asara and abarsnuva. Draxt As. describes them in
§44 = yut.sartak martomak abnormal men,
ke manend tar 6 bum which live beyond the earth,
+vitastlk u varcasm the pygmies and the “chest-eyed”
ke casm pa var ast whose eyes are on their chest.
yut-sartak “heterogeneous, allophyl” is used in the Dcn\art, chapter
on the literary history of the Awesta, where Shahpuhr II canonizes not
only the Awesta written by Atarpat, but also yut-sartak texts. These are
not the “nachtraglich hinzugekommenen,” as Nyberg translates, 4i8f.,
but the “heterogeneous,” i.e. non-religious texts, the scientific literature
translated by Shahpuhr’s order from Greek and Syriac.
varcasman and vargosan, chest-eyed, chest-eared, sagsaran, “dog
headed,” and vitastlkan “span-long, Germ. Daumling,” Gr. Sa/mAoi,
are all described in Aydt\.Zdm., Messina ch.9, cf. Gr.Bdh. 107. Ctesias
and Megasthenes describe similar prodigies after Indian fairy tales, but
Ctesias’ sources were Iranian, and the Vid. passage shows that they were
known in Iran. “The headless, aK€^>aXot, that have the eyes on their

chest” of Herodotus iv,i9i are in Libya. The same a/ce^aXot = asara
appear in Pseudo-Callisthenes 111,28, and were propagated all over the
world with the romance of Alexander. They entered old English minia
tures and the Niirnberger Weltchroni\. Hence, Shakespeare mentions
them in Othello and the Storm. Nor are they lacking in 1001 Nights
ed. Cairo 11,97: “and I saw many creatures who had their eyes on their
chest.” They are really well known everywhere.
Bartholomae actually found something religious even in these figures
of fairy tales: a alpetm a/c€ 0aXo?, a sect without chief. And in Nyberg’s
theory, which considers this chapter of the Videvdad as the true history
of the Zoroastrian mission, the country of the headless ones, on the
Jaxartes, becomes the country where Zoroaster, after his “headless”
flight from his homeland, founded his first community.



XLII. HELLENISM AND CHRISTIANITY
Under ‘Arithmetic’ we mentioned the verses of ¥£.13,16, where
Buddha appears under the name naSyah Gotama, and under ‘Balkh’
some other allusions to Buddhism at the time of the Greco-Bactrian
kingdom. The only other allusion to Hellenism in the Awesta, so far
discussed, was “scepsis and hyperscepsis” as characteristics of Nisaia
and Raga as the Greek towns Alexandropolis and Europus. However
scarce, such allusions are important for dating the parts of the Awesta
in which they occur.
Alexander himself, though admitted into the Iranian epics, has left
no trace in the Awesta. But Ionians appear, and they may be either
Greeks of the Seleucid or the Bactrian kingdom. The name is +yona
like OP. yona < Gr. icov-, while 01 ., like Akkad, has yavana from
older Gr. iafcov.
In a linguistically poor fragment of the Vistaspa legend in Yt.9,29-31,
Vistaspa prays for victory over several adversaries, among them:
“maryahya Ryonahya arjataspahya, the hyonian slave Arjataspa”
and
uta azam fra.rvesyani and (that) I may bring home
humaya vrdakana(m)ca Humaya and +Vrdanaka
liyonaya haca dahyavo from the hyonian countries
uta azam nijanani and I may slay
Ryonlnam dahyunam. ... of the hyonian countries. . . .
The ethnic Ryona appears only once more, in Yt. 19,87, verses mod
elled after 5,108, where “and the evil . . . Ryona,” from 9,31, is added
to “victory over Arjataspa.” In all other fragments of the Vistaspa
legend—¥£.17,48 ( = 9,29-31 shortened), ¥£.5,108-109 (Vistaspa on lake
Frazdanu) and ¥£.5,113 and 116—Arjataspa and his people are called
devayasna and drugvant, but their ethnic, if mentioned at all, is not
Ryona, but turya. In the oldest and most explicit form of the legend, as
told by Chares of Mytilene, Homartes, i.e. Homarges, the ethn. (Saka)
homavrga, replaces the n.pr. Arjataspa. The Saka were Iranian subjects
when Cyrus was killed in the far northeast; under Darius and Xerxes
their country is counted as satrapy. When Alexander arrived there, they
were independent like the Hvarazmiya. They must have regained their



772 HELLENISM AND CHRISTIANITY
independence in the course of the fifth century, and appear as foreigners
in the legend of the fourth century.
The Pahl. commentators—and the later epic—understood Ryona as
hiydn, the Chionites. 1 Western authors mention them first as auxiliaries
of Shahpuhr II at the siege of Amida in a.d. 356-359, and it is only
Bahram V, Yazdegird II and Peroz who have continuously to fight a
group of central Asiatic peoples, among them the Chionites, that had
invaded the area of the former Yona kingdom. Josua Stylites, in a.d.
466, identifies them with the Kidara Huns, or Hephthalites : “xyvny’
that are the hvny’.” Hephthalite coins with oiono, i.e. hiono, confirm
Josua. 2
The yasht passages are not old, but none can be as young as the fifth
century a.d. Nyberg 296: “einem andren [not saying which] Zeitraum
der Geschichte Zentralasiens gehoren nach allem zu urteilen die hyaona
an . . . Herzfeld’s Ansicht, dass hyaona fur yaona steht, finde ich
unannehmbar, da hyaona nicht von xiy°n getrennt werden kann.”
That is why I did not separate them: “Ryona can be an orthography of
Sasanian copyists who saw the hiyon in yvn = yona of the text.” “Copy
ists” was no good expression; one can define it better.
Into the epics the name of the Chionites entered during or shortly
after the fifth century a.d. Gr.Bdh. 198b and Men.Xr. (Ankles. 61)
write, in two versions:
“tvrk BRH-y // xyvn” or “tvrk-y brh v xyvn KLYTVN.t’”
The verb KLYTVN.t = xvant, demands a preceding relative MNv = ke in
stead of or after the ligature brh; // indicates uncertain reading, hence
perhaps -s :
“tvrk BRH-y” or simply “tvrk-y [mnv.s] xyvn KLYTVN.t”
“a (young) Turk—who are called hiyon”—hits Sam with his arrow, he
falls asleep, lying in dramnak (see under ‘Ardvi’) and covered by snow,3
awakening only at the resurrection. Turk, at the time of the Bdh.,
translates “turya,” and the gloss “hiyon” may have had some support
in an old yvn, yona, of the text.
1 Cf. Markwart, Erdnsahr 50; Volkjtum d. Komanen 70 f.; A. Christensen, Kayanides 25 and 157; and ami vi, 27b 2 Cf. ASl. Mem. 3 8, Kuskan. -Susan. Coins, 19. 3 The legend, usually located in Pisin, Arachosia, is also told on the Savalan mountain near Ardebll, see C. Ritter, Erdkjtnde v. Asien ix,8oi: “in einer Schneespalte liegt der ewige eingefrorene Mann, der sich immer gleich bleibt.”



HELLENISM AND CHRISTIANITY 773
The changing designations reveal: The old myth spoke of turya;
the Achaemenian version, attested by Chares, in which the myth
coalesced with that of the Bactrian Druvaspa-Luhrasp, introduced the
name homavrga. The third ethnic, (h)yona may refer to the Greeks
of Alexander’s time, but since the legend developed in eastern regions,
(h)yona was more probably introduced in Arsacid times referring to
the Greco-Bactrians. In Sasanian times, the hiyon occupied the region of
these yona, names that call for identification. When the Bactrian king
dom was long since forgotten, the old yon and new hiyon were actually
believed to be the same people.
The epic which never ceased to absorb new historical events, admitted
the Hiyon; but to appear in the Awesta the people came much too late.
The Awesta writes hyona with a special sign, not with normal h, and
this occurs as initial only in the name hyona and in “hyat” for the par
ticle yat or the opt. of Vah-, Lat. “siet.” One ms. writes ahyon-. In
medial position the sign is used for h before y, e.g. in dahyu-, but never
exclusively; certain copyists only—here the expression fits—transferred
it from initial to medial, but originally it was a special sign for the
name hyona only.
In the Muhammedan period one may imagine changes in the Awes
tic text, but not the invention of new characters, the less so as there
were two signs for h available. And during the Sasanian period, the
text could not be changed, because Shahpuhr II had canonized the whole
corpus as written by Atarpat: “now, since the religion is visible to the
world, we shall not tolerate anybody’s irreligiosity, that shall be our
continuous endeavor; and he acted accordingly.” Thus the sign must
have been invented, along with the whole Aw. alphabet, for use in this
name.
Much has been written about imaginary ordeals of Zoroaster—see
under ‘Last Judgment’—but the real ordeal which Atarpat underwent
has received little attention .
4 The Den\. says: “pas ac bb^tan e atarpat
pa gowisn e passant, after A. had been acquitted by the testimony of
the ordeal,” that means the divine confirmation of the accuracy of the
text he had written. At the first writing, under Volagases I, in Arsacid
Aramaic, and at the second transliteration of this archetype into Sasa
nian script under Ardashir I, no such divine testimony was required.
4 See Sacr. Books of the East v,376.



774 HELLENISM AND CHRISTIANITY
The ordeal raises Atarpat’ s achievement far above the former attempts,
and besides, it is the last one. Therefore, Atarpat was the inventor of
the AweStic script.
That is why he ranks high in the history of the Zoroastrian religion.
The Bahman Y/.i,i ' tells of a vision of Zoroaster: First he had prayed
for immortality, but the god declines, because granting this wish would
contradict resurrection and salvation, eternal life in heaven. Then he
sees a tree with four branches, of gold, silver, steel and “mixed-with
iron,” which the god explains as degeneration until, after a thousand
years, the first sosyant appears. The Denkart interprets the four phases
as (i) revelation of the religion; (2) Vistaspa’s accepting the religion;
(3) Atarpat restoring it; (4) the time after Shahpuhr II.
Taken as a paleographic problem, all the signs of the Awestic script
are derived from Sasanian cursive during a phase this cursive had
reached in the middle of the fourth century, in perfect agreement with
the above result. This theory diverges widely from the eclectic way of
invention which H. Junker advanced in his treatise on the Awestic
script. It is based on the paleography of the Sasanian inscriptions, and,
unfortunately, cannot be proved without publishing the squeezes and
photographs of all inscriptions and legends on coins and seals referring
to the problem, a material which is in my hands.
The h used in hyona is—like 5 :a, e:e, y:k, J:c, t:t—differentiated
from hv by a diacritical hook or flourish under the letter, which makes
it a sign hy, h only used before y. The other h signs replace a letter of
the Aramaic archetype. If the archetype had an h in the name hyvn,
there was no need or reason to create a special sign: the diacritical hook
marks the sign as an addition which interprets yvn as hiyon. The
Chionites appear first in 356-59, the very time when Atarpat was work
ing, and the invention of the Awestic script is dated thereby in about
A.D. 360.
About that time a strange passage in Y.9 must have been composed
(st.24)
:
homo . . . krsanim apa.^sa^ram nisaSayat
Homa . . . has expelled the krsani from the empire.

nisastan, “to settle,” cf. J. H. Kramers, bsos viii, on the nisastagan,
military colonists on the Caucasus limes, apa.^sa^ra, a spurious com

expel from the country,” IPars. mn stry rdytn. apa.^sa^ra implies the
notion “foreign country, Ausland” like late Aw. (Nir.g) uzdahyu from
TPahl. uzdeh, in a political acceptation not possible before the time of
Mithradates II, end of the 2nd century b.c.
“yo rosta xsatfrokamyo yo davata”
Bartholomae: “rosta, der jammerte.” The following lines speak of
carat, and comparing Y.51,12 rurost asto and Fi^.1,49 cara and aparo
Saya, one must translate “he forbade.” xsa^rokamya, Bartholomae “in
der Sorge um seine Herrschaft,” but kama is never “anxiety,” but the
“bon plaisir” of one who has power over something. A xsatfrokamya
has power over the xsatfra, is a sah e kamkar, cf. Papak’s letter to
Ardashir in Karn .: “Ardavan is kamkartar patixsay over us,” absolute
ruler; often in inscriptions, kamkar u patixsay. xsa#rakamya is the
same as xvatavya: the ySao-t\ehs avTOKpdrwp, hence:
he forbade, the emperor, he issued an edict,
noit me apam a0rava awistis vrSye dahyava carat.
“not shall henceforth an a^ravan sojourn in my country in order to . .
.”
an ungrammatical sentence, cf. Benveniste, Inf.av. 39. carat means “to
live, travel”; awistis vrSye, according to Bartholomae “studia (sacra)
ut augeat”; but Pahl.transl. “pa kamak, as he pleases.” The inf. vrSye
stands for MP. varzisn, “for the work” at an activity expressed by
awisti, a pseudo-Aw. noun abstr. to awyaxsaya, “inspection,” or—think
ing of “awistar, raider”—“incursion, immigration.”
ho vispe vrSinam vanat ni vispe vrSinam janat
The general sense of Bartholomae’s translation is “the foreign, Persian,
student steals and kills our—the exiled krsani’s—knowledge.” The aw
ful sentence is no part of the edict, but laments over its consequences.
The subject of “ho vanat—janat” is the same as of “yo rosta—davata,”
viz. the emperor, vanat cannot belong to MP. vanitan, vanquish, but
must be syn. of “ni janat, ruins.” The usual MP. phrase is vinaset-janet,
here perhaps V van- “annihilate.” All is Sas. Parsik transposed into
Awestic.



776 HELLENISM AND CHRISTIANITY
The Pahl. transl. of krsanim is “kilsiyak,” explained by “tarsakdenlh,
Christianity”; Skr. transl. equally kalasiyakah. The Sasanian govern
ment had expelled Christians, and the Byzantine emperor answered
by forbidding Sasanian priests to travel in his countries. This sounds
like the beginning of persecutions of Christians in Iran, and the oldest
recorded by western sources was in a.d. 346 under Shahpuhr II. But
there seems to have been an earlier one, for a passage isolated by large
gaps, and hence not quite comprehensible, of the Karter inscriptions,
time of Shahpuhr I (Bahram II?), KiZ I.9, NiR 29, SMash. 14, says:

and the . . . and Jews and Shamans and Brahmans and Nasraya and
Kilsiyanlk and M. . . . and Zandik in the country were killed, destruc
tion of the idols and ... of the devs. . . .”
A shorter enumeration of non-Iranian religions appears in a tolerance
edict, quoted in a retrospective speech delivered at the time of the
Armenian rebellion against Yazdegird II by the chief MobaS:6 “in our
country the Magus, the Zandik, the Jew, the Christian and what other
religions there are, shall live for their faith in peace!” The intolerance
of Shahpuhr II, to whom Schaeder attributed the edict, is a fact, and I
would still prefer to ascribe it to Shahpuhr I, although the inscription
reveals persecutions in his time : the edict may have put an end to them.
The inscription distinguishes between n’cr’y and klsynyk’n. The
first is Syr. nasrave, n.t. nasoraya, Na^wpatoi; the second is ^ptcrfrji
avo?, seemingly influenced in form by e/ocA^ara Pahl. kalisak, kanlsak,
associated with the notion. 7 Vahm.Yt.-. “ac avesan hesm.to^makan sal

Berlin, Kurd, hasp i si, is “sorrel.” The calamity chapter of the Gr.Bdh.
speaks of worship of devs by “those with vijat.vars (tonsure?), of the
kilasiyak, setasp of Hrom, Arabs etc.” Thus, the expression aims at the
color of the hair of these red-heads, and is the same as Arab, banu 1-asfar,
“yellow, blonde” for Byzantines and later Franks.8 The opposite is banu
1-aswad “black-heads,” Arabs, just as the Babylonians call themselves
salmat qaqqade. Markwart, Siidartnenien, gave another explanation,
not really contradictory: Talmudic scholarship made Zepho, sfv, son of
Eliphaz, son of Esau, Gen. 36, the ancestor of the Romans, equating
Rome with Edom; the lxx write 1 d>(f>ap, and the figures are the same
as Eliphaz and Sophar, friends of Job. The Arabs, e.g. Biruni, accepted
this genealogy: al-Asfar b. Elifaz b. al-‘Is (Esau); and Dinawari: “al
Rum b. Elifaz.” But the reason for this equation was the interpretation
of sfv, sofar, as “blonde.” In an inscription of a wife of Saladin at
Salihin, Aleppo, the protocol of the sultan contains the words: “con
queror of the green tiraz from the bani 1-asfar, the yellow ones.” Green
is the color of the prophet, and the words play upon the colors.
kilsiyakih, therefore, are the Byzantine Christians, seemingly in op
position to the nacray as Nestorian Christians of Iran. Y.9,24 designates
by krsanlm the Christians of Byzantium. It is a pseudo-Aw. word,
derived from MP. kirsyanik, kirsenik. Y.9,24, written under Shahpuhr I
or after 346 under Shahpuhr II, immediately before the writing of the
Awesta in Awestic script, is the youngest dateable passage in the Awesta.
The picture the Denkart gives—end of b.m and beginning of iv,
vol.ix,450-456—of the literary tradition of the Awesta starts from the
primary assumption that it was written by Zoroaster under the reign of
Vistaspa, a notion produced by its mazdayasnian redaction. Either Vis
taspa or Daray b. Darayan, the last Darius, had one copy deposited in
the gan] i seclgan, the archives of the temple of Sez, another one at Diz
i nipist, i.e. Naqsh i Rustam, considered as archives of Persepolis. Under
the reign of the “cursed Alexander,” the copy at Diz i nipist was
destroyed by the fire, that of Sez was carried to Egypt and translated
into Greek (in the library of Alexandria).9 Under Valaxs i Askan,

Volagases I, all written or oral tradition that had escaped destruction
was collected and preserved. A similar collection, with redaction—ad
mitting and eliminating of parts—was conducted by the ehrpat Tansar
under Ardashir I. Shahpuhr I ordered translations to be made from
Indian and Greek works on medicine, astronomy, mathematics, chro
nology, geography, chemistry, physics, economics, philology and other
arts and sciences, and to add them to the Corpus of the Awesta, the
originals being kept at the ganj i Secigan. Shahpuhr II after his vic
torious wars, had a redaction of the whole material made, including the
non-religious works, and had them arranged in “Nasks.” This was done
through Atarpat e Mahraspandan. The work, for which Atarpat passed
an ordeal, was canonized. Xusrau I, after having destroyed Mazdakism,
had a commentary written.
From our studies a picture results which essentially agrees with this
tradition : The oldest dates we can ascertain of pre-Zoroastrian materials
in the Awesta, lie between 678, foundation of the Median empire, 612,
destruction of Nineveh, 550 conquest of Agbatana, and 539 conquest of
Babylon by Cyrus. The memorial document of Vistaspa’s temple, in
Y/.13, is near 527 e.c. The datable gatha are between 539 and 522, acces
sion of Darius.
Collecting of songs and hymns started after Zoroaster’s death, at the
same time as the redaction of the epic songs into a great epopee. The
mazdayasnian redaction of this material began under Artaxerxes II and
ended with Alexander. There were among this material hymns to
gods, to which all definitions of Gr. “hymnos”—see Wiinsch in Pauly,
re.—can directly be applied, but no more than the Greek hymns were
these Iranian hymns “liturgies.” The mazdayasnian redaction was made
for liturgical purposes, and this character became more and more accen

La precision de ce renseignement semble garantir son authenticite. Cette immense collection etait evidemment pseudoepigraphe. Le bibliothecaire Hermippe qui ne se piquait pas d’une exactitude scrupuleuse, peut avoir classe
sous le nom de Zoroastre tous ies ecrits religieux des Perses que l’on possedait peut-etre meme ceux des Chaldeens, mais il n’en subsiste pas moins ce fait remarquable qu'il existait au Musee une serie considerable de traductions des idiomes iraniens a cote de celles, aujourd’hui mieux connues, de 1’Egypte et de 1 'Hebreu.”
On pp. 32-33 Cumont sa>s that all notes preserved in classical literature are apocryphal, not a single one Awestic. Therefore, the only possible explanation of the two million verses attributed
to Zoroaster is that the Museum owned translations of late Babylonian literature.

tuated during the further long history of the Awesta. From Alexander
to Mithradates II, who consciously attempted the restoration of the old
empire, there were probably no accessions to the Awesta, only losses.
Then came chapt. i, geographical poem, and ii-m, Yama myth, of the
Videvdad during the earlier, and the Videvdad proper, the Code, dur
ing the second half of the Arsacid period, when the magi of Adhar
baijan were powerful under the rule of the Atropatenian line of
Arsacids.
Parts like the gatha and the memorial document may have had, of
old, an aide-memoire in Aramaic script, but the whole corpus of the
Awesta was not fixed in writing before the middle of the first century
a.d., under Volagases I, when the oral tradition was failing. The Videv
dad must have been written from the beginning.
This Arsacid prototype was transposed into Sasanian script under
Ardashir. That Shahpuhr I had scientific books translated from Indian
and Greek is confirmed by the identification of a few book titles by
Nallino. The youngest datable passage in the Awesta, Y.9,24, may
belong to the time of Shahpuhr I or of Shahpuhr II, after a.d. 346, and
in about a.d. 360 the writing of the Awesta in Awestic script was com
pleted. Thus the genesis of our Awesta took just a thousand years.
From that time on it was only a question of preservation and trans
mission.

Othello, v,2
Together with history, that is with documents we can read and date,
about 3000 b.c., the Bronze Age begins in the Near Eastern countries.
A thousand years of Copper Age precede it, and the Stone Age recedes
into the fifth millennium. The alluvial lowlands, with the more inten
sive and, since the beginning of history, more advanced civilization,
had no metals and imported them from the highlands. Thus the devel
opment of both, in this respect, was inseparably linked together. The
Bronze Age lasted about 1,500 years, and after 1500 b.c., iron—a metal
known since about 1900—appears, first rare and valuable, but in the 6th
century b.c., at Pasargadae, already used as building material.
One can no longer maintain the thesis, formulated in 1882 by W.
Geiger, in his Ostiranische Kultur, that the Awesta belonged to the
Bronze Age, because iron was unknown, and the alternative “copper
or iron” implied by Nyberg, 257: “Fur die Gatha-Gemeinde war
Metall soviel wie Kupfer, nicht Eisen” is at all events impossible, be
cause 1,500 years of Bronze lie between the two. Sentences like “Dass
Gold in den Gatha fehlt, mag Zufall sein; auch Silber kommt nicht
vor,” “der Mithrakreis kannte sowohl Gold wie Silber,” 262 : “Anahita
[who was bedecked with gold] gehort nicht zum Mithra-Kreise” would
have no meaning even if they did not refer to words in a few poems,
but to results of extensive excavations, for, gold appears as early as
copper, earlier than silver, but neither of them characterizes a period.
The Gatha-Gemeinde of course did not flourish in the Stone Age or
at the Copper Age—the period of original Indo-European language
and was not a thousand years older than the Mithra-Gemeinde. These
communities never existed.
The linguistic material shows that the IE. languages began to branch
off with the Bronze Age, after 3000 b.c. There can be no common IE.
word for iron, because iron is too young. Copper, on the contrary, was
known: Skr. lohah “copper,” later “iron”; Aw. roSita = OI. rohita,1 OP.
1 roSita only in Yt. 19,2 as name of a mountain, “copper-mountain,” in Gr.Bdh. royisn, in Ind. Bdh. better ro>en kof. Besides, r65ita as epithet of snakes, “copper-snakes” m Vtd.1,2. Sum. urudu has been compared to Bask, urraida “copper,” which H. Schuchardt explains as “like gold.” The Hittite form is still hidden behind the ideogr. urud.



INDUSTRIES 781
*roda in MP. roy, Arm. aroir; Lat. raudus, “piece of ore, mineral.”
This leads to IE. ‘raudha which reflects the same original as Sum. urudu.
Neither the people of IE. language nor the Sumerians, nor the Semites,
were miners; all borrowed the word from the language of Anatolian
miners. Since old Sum. bad urud.nagar1*1 “enclosure of the copper
smiths” is read Bad.Tibira, “of the Tibira,” i.e. Tibaroi, urudu seems to
render the word for copper in their language.
The region west of Hamah in Syria, with copper mines, is called in
Boghazkoi and T.Amarna texts (i5th-i3th centuries) nuhasse, whence
Akk. nahustum (only in T.Amarna texts), Hebr. nehosat, (‘ir) nahas,
Arab, nuhas “copper.” Assurnasirpal writes luhuti instead, 2 and Zakir of
Hamat lu‘us. Nuhasse and lu‘us reflect an Anatolian original for “cop
per,” and since it is connected with O.T. khelubh
, Gr. chalybes, it seems
to be the word for copper in their dialect.
When the alloy, bronze, became known and other metals with it,
new names were borrowed by IE. languages and the signification of
older names shifted. To Ved. ayas, Gath, ayah correspond Lat. aes,
Goth, aiz, Nord. eir, AS. ar > ore, hence IE. *aios “ore.” Meillet, Introd.
“mot I.E. ou du moins repandu au moment ou les langues de la famille
I.E. etaient encore en contact.”
A “mountain A'isa” appears in the annals of TiglathPileser I, and its
position can be determined from the following sources: Salmanassar I,
about 1260 b.c., invaded Uruatri, southern Armenia, and eight of its
districts, of which some belong to Enzitene and Melitene (opp. each
other on the united Euphrates). He destroyed Arina, “the well-founded
fortress” and “strew kudime, ‘cress’ on its ruins” (see under ‘Krsvar’).
Therewith the “whole of Muzri was subjected” and he returned by way
of Hanigalbat, south of Enzitene. TiglathPileser I, a° 5, about 1100 b.c.,
occupied the country Muzri; its neighbors, the Qumani, came to help,
yet he seized “the town Arini (var.l. arinni) at the foot of mount A'isa,”
then turned against Qumani and took its “strong place Hunusa and its
royal city Kibsuma.” AdadNerari II, a 3
1 (91 1 b.c.) fought in Kumani,
situated beside Kutmuhi, and Sargon, a° 10, ab. 713 b.c., occupied
Kammanu, destroyed Meliddu, and rebuilt Tilgarimmu after having
conquered “the whole of Kammanu”; he returned via Mar‘as and Gur
gum (Zenjirli-region).

Qumani, with all its variants, is Komana; Kutmuhi is Kommagene,
Meliddu Melitene. Muzri, with its town Arina, must be the region of
Zetun, i.e. “olivetum,” old Ulnia [“ul” is the original Anatol. word for
olive, oil], 25 miles N. of Mar‘as. The name Muzri is the same as mod.
Mzur, district of Dersim in Armenia, in the angle formed by the two
Euphrates confluents, N. of Melitene-Enzitene, Byz. Kkifia Mov£ovpwv;
Arab, djabal Muzur in ibn Serapion. But this lies west of the Euphrates.
The name seems to have had a wider application in antiquity, but to
have survived only in its northeastern part. Zetun lies in the Qabaq
Dagh, near the famous iron- and copper-mines of Sarycicek, which
apparently are Mt. A'isa, the “ore-mountain.” 3
In Ved. and Aw. ayas has the adj. yellow, red, black, it is bronze,
not copper. And yet, in later times, Ir. ayah may as well mean iron, as
Skr. lohah, once copper, became iron.
Hiibschmann, PersStud. 10, called NP. ahan “obscure” and postu
lated OP. ‘asaina for MP. asen; Tedesco, Dialektologie, mo. xv,i89, ex
plained it: “NP. ahan < OP. *a#ena, MP. asen < Med. *asena”; hence
Ar. prepal. k’, and no connection with ayah. In Yti 0,129 the text has
ahena sparya, which Wb. registers as clerical error under ayahena; it
means a special kind of iron, hence perhaps +asena sp(a)rya. In Y?.io,i30,
Vid.7,74 and 8,90, another name of a special kind of iron, hosafnena
appears, Pahl. transl. polavaten “of steel.” Both words denote material
of common weapons and vessels, and whatever the special meaning is,
they are enough to show that assertions like “Eisen fehlt im ganzen
Awesta” are wrong. Not even parts of the Awesta can possibly belong
to the Bronze Age.
Yr.io, 128-132 describe the arms lying in Mithra’s chariot. As there

chariots.
isunam krkasa.paranam4 offends against the meter. Since one can
scarcely assume haplologic shortening to -p(a)rnam, one syllable of
the first component is redundant. In the song “Mithra as warrior” (see
below, Yt. 10,39) isavo rzifya.prna, arrows with eagle-feathers are twice
mentioned, and feathers of buzzards and eagles may have been used.
But arrows for great armies were mass-products. Bazaars of nashshabin
(Arab.) or tirgaran (NP.), arrow-makers, existed in all Oriental towns
until recently, and the feathers were those of the prosaic cock, the krka,
highly esteemed as announcer of the dawn, parodars. Without hesita
tion one may read, in good meter “isuvam krka.p(a)rnanam, with
cock-feathers,” cf. Yr.15,61: mryahya krpa krk(as)ahya under ‘Naviga
tion.’
The other metrical offense in the following verse is easily cured : espe
cially in parallel with srvi.stay one must read +zari- for zaranya.zafar.
Bartholomae took this word as a figure for the arrowheads’ “biting”
like the mouth of an animal; A. V. W. Jackson as “golden-notched.”
In srvi.stay, against former interpretations, srvi- stands for srva “lead,”
cf. +srvi.zanga “with shanks of lead,” epithet of SnaviSka, under
‘Krsvar’; stay, to Vsta- “stand,” means the balance of the arrow in the
air: a small counterpoise of lead for the metal arrow-head.
The gloss in 129 refers to +zari.zafar and means “arrow-heads for real
use are not of gold, but of sprya iron.” Lommel, by drawing the gloss

unduly into the text, came to translate: “der Schaft der gutgemachten
ist aus Eisen( ?),” but shafts were never of iron. From Aw. sprya comes
Syr. sbvrqn, loanword from MP., used by Elias of Nisibis for Gr.
XaXmfj, name of steel of best quality, because the Chalybes in Halybe
on the Pontus made the best steel. In the Syr. Alexander-book the ethnic
xd\t>/3e?, too, is rendered by sbvrqny’.5 NP. dictionaries give no authori
tative passages for their saburan, saburak, saburgan “steel,” which is
taken from Paid, glossaries, as the MP. ending -ak betrays; the vowels
are inconclusive, evidently assimilated to sabur < sahpuhr. MP., Syr.
sbvrqn is like yaXw/; a name of provenance, and the place is Suburgan,
Sibirgan in Vekrta-Gozgan, see under ‘Videvdad.’ The same place has
given the word suburgan, supurgan to Uiguric and Mongolic in the
meaning “stupa”; cf. the case of ka#wa “donkey” and qahwa “wine”
under ‘Homa.’ The origin of the name is sprya ahena “iron of Sprya.” 6
To differentiate words for steel from iron by names of provenance
is almost a rule. I am inclined to connect also Assyr. habalklnu7 “of
steel” with chalyps. Hattusil III, owner of the iron mines of Kizvatna,
i.e. Cappadocia Pontica, in his famous letter8
is decidedly reluctant to
allow the export of the rare material, and sends, on request and as ap
peasement, only one dagger blade of iron. Tusratta of Mitanni sends
Amenophis III as precious gift two dagger blades and ten “giakatu
habalklnu, of steel.” The only place for him to get them was Kizvatna;
habalklnu, here, expresses the provenance from the country in which
the Chalybes lived, and is apparently an original +halabkinu.9 From this
very region, the town Samsun, came in about 1890, an iron dagger of

Ms. on the geography of the Anc. Near East, and am unable to accept Goetze’s argument: Kizvatna (cf. Ass. kitpat) is originally Med. Katpatuka, Gr. Kappadokia Pontika; only after Alexander the name was extended to include the southern Komana, and there the name survived after the original country had become simple “Pontus.’’ 9 Change of liquids in foreign names is especially frequent in Sem. languages when the name contains a labial. Cf. also Horn, moiibos, Rhod. bolibos, Epid. bolimos, Lat. plumbum. In the region in question was also a town to which the term habalklnu mav possibly refer. Strabo 12,3,16: "behind Themiscyra is the Sidenj with the fortified places Side, x aPaKa and
Rhabda on the coast; so far goes Amisene (Samsun); then Pharnakla and Trapezus.” Strabo's Xabaka seems to be the town x aP aTKa o£ Sidene, of which coins are known.

that period, in the Khanenko collection in Kiew, of which six or eight
specimens have turned up in recent years in Luristan.
Before determining hosafnena, the weapons themselves deserve some
study.
In Yt.io,39-40, stanzas belonging to the same song as 128-131, the
almost identical series of arms recurs, as arms of the enemies, made in
elfective by Mithra
39: isvascit rzifya.prna The arrows with eagle-feathers
hudaxtat haca danvanat that from the well-bent bow

vazracit hunivixta yoi niyrare the maces well swung down which
shall
sarahi martiyakanam descend upon the heads of men

A third corresponding passage is Yt. 13,72, where the fravarti make
their friends proof against the arms of their enemies:
1:3,72 ; yada noit tat pati karto that not the daggers,
hufraharsto easy to draw,

noit rstis huvawiyasta not the lances well thrown,
noit asano rma.suto not the stones moved by (force
of) arm,

These poor verses again are the model of YV.i,i8:
1,18: noit dim naram ayan avas- not would hit this man
yat
noit akavo noit cakavo noit neither akavo, nor hatchets, nor
isavo arrows,

noit karta noit vazra nor knife, nor mace,
noit visante asino avasayat nor can stones hit him.
The five arms in Yt. 10,128-131 are the same as in 39-40: (1) bow and
arrow, (2) lance, (4) dagger, (5) mace; only for (3) cakus, hatchet or
axe, the other verses have sling-stone.
The most detailed description of military equipment is in Vid. 14,9, a
passage compared by Noldeke with Tabari’s story of Xusrau, who first,
believing himself to be exempt, did not appear at the roll-call, then,
rebuked by the general, came, but forgot his arrow-heads. This late
Sasanian tale resembles indeed the Videvdad passage, and yet this must
be a very old piece. radoisti alone, though a deformity, proves that
the original described the equipment of an old ra#esta, and the wrong
context in which the piece is put is conclusive: this equipment is im
posed, among endless other deliveries, as a punishment for having
inadvertently deprived an otter of one of its eyes. Vid. 14,9:

1-6 are offensive, 7-12 defensive weapons. Herodotus, when describing
the army at Doriscus, 480 b.c., names the defensive weapons first. The
weapons of the Persians are (1) long bow, cane arrows in quivers, (2)
long lances, (3) daggers suspended from the belt, worn at the right
thigh : iyxeipi^La irapa tov he^iov prjpov TrapaiO)pevpeva in rrj^

The sculptures show the slight differences between the Median and
the Persian armament: the Medes have the bow in a case, the Persians
have a quiver only for arrows. The Medes wear the dagger suspended

as Herodotus describes it, but the Persians wear them sticking in their
belts. Herodotus is right in calling the equipment Median.
Aw. karta are the iyxeiplBia. karta, MP. kart, NP. kard, is every
knife; in Vid. 14, the Pahl. transl. adds “sampser, sword.” The adjectives
mean: waya.dara, “sharp at both edges,” in distinction from “one
edged”; hu.frayuxta “well-suspended” irapaicopevpevos (not “gut
geschwungen”) ; huiarhrsta “well-drawn,” easily drawn from its scab
bard.
gaSa in 131, everywhere else vazra, are synonyms; a distinction of
throw and blow is not probable. Herodotus mentions ponaXa only as
weapons of Aethiopians and Mesopotamians, a#ura, and wooden ones
at that, studded with iron, cf. sata.fstana “with a hundred studs” as
epithet of Mithra’s vazra in Y/.io,96.
The sling, frada^sana, is not among the military equipment at Doris
cus, and was perhaps a hunting weapon. The Pahl. transl. is kvpyn, NP.
gopal. I have an object of earthenware like an Assyrian ziqqatu, from
Gannawa, N of Bushire, where they are found in heaps and are called
gopal as “sling-stones of Rustam.” 10 In 130, instead of the sling, we find
cakus, i.e. NP. cakus, cakuj “hammer.” Like “tabar,” word for the same
instrument, this may be a loanword from a non-Iranian language: the
n.pl. cakavo does not agree with the gen. cakusanam. Herodotus men
tions battle-axes, d^ivas craydpis only as weapons of the Saka, viuhq
whereas the sculptures show the Sogdians wearing them and offering
them as tribute. In the Ermitage are some golden originals from Keler
mes. biteya means a hammer with blade and butt; they are double axes.
aku, by which one is “hit,” cannot mean “scissors” (Wb.), for which,
besides, one would expect a dual name. It may belong to aka (instr.sg.)
in Y/. 10, 125 and anxnah in Y/-5,ii (see under ‘Mithra’), Gr. dy/oAp
“thong, noose,” cf. Lat. anus “ring” < ‘aqknos; then, akavo would be
lasso, rope. Herodotus mentions such creipa (to Vhl-, Germ, “seil”)
with the Sagartians.
Thus, the verses of Yt. 10 describe Median weapons of the 6th and 5th
centuries. Among them is the cakus, the material of which is hosafnena,
a word for steel, important for cultural stratigraphy.
cakusanam hosafnenam biteyanam is the only verse of 12 syllables
in st.128-130; one of the two adjectives might be added subsequently.

The arrows have three, all other weapons only one adjective, biteya is
an essential quality of the weapon and is covered by the analogous adj.
wayadara of karta. On the other hand, hosafnena as adj. of material is
covered by ayahena “of bronze,” epithet of gaSa in 13 1. cakusanam
hosafnenam are bad forms as to grammar, it should be + cakusam +hosaf
nenanam. This seems to me decisive: a thematic gen.pl. cakusanam is
inadmissible in verses of the 6th century, and cakusam biteyanam
would be faulty in meter. The verse requires an epithet, in the gen.pl.,
of five syllables; hence hosafnena is a genuine part of these verses, of
the 6th century b.c. The two old glosses in 128 and 129 may be as old
as the fifth century.
hosafnena appears a second time in Vid.7,74, in a rule, how to clean
ahvarna, eating vessels of gold, zarnena; silver, rzatena; bronze, aya
hena; hosafnena and zarstvena.
The last one is usually translated “of stone,” Pahl. sangen. There were
plenty of stone vessels, in Persepolis mostly of green stone, which pro
tects against poison: patizahr > bezoar. But in Vid1
.8,8 and 10, the noun
zarstva is coupled with isti, “sun-dried brick,” see zmoistve, i.e.
zam+isti, under ‘Yama Xseta,’ and means “burnt brick.” The OP.
word for enamelled bricks, Akk. agurru, missing in Dar.chart.Sus., is
a[g]ura[va], corresponding to El. halat.ukku, “on burnt clay-tablets”
in Bek. §70, see under ‘Memorial Document.’ zarstva is the common
brick; zarstvena as adj. of vessels “earthenware.” In Yt. 10,39 fraSax
sanya “sling-stones” are called so: like the gopal from Gannawa, they
actually were made of brick, and the very oldest ovoid slingstones are of
sundried clay only. Thus the sequence of the vessels is: of gold, silver,
bronze, hosafnena and earthenware.
The third passage with hosafnena is Vid.8,90, soon to be discussed in
full, a series of industrial works, among them, in the same order “places
where gold, silver, bronze and hosafnena are forged.” This proves the
word to be a metal, iron or steel, but something is wrong, for not the
adj. “of iron,” but the subst. “iron” is forged.
The archetype of Aw. haosafnaena would be h(’)vspnyn, with -yn,
-ena, as ending of adjectives of material. The word for steel is in Afghan
ospana and ospina, in Ossetic afsan, in Pamir dialects spin, according to



INDUSTRIES 789
Tomaschek also ispin. 11 These surviving forms prove the Aw. vocali
zation of h(’)vspnyn to be wrong: not haosafnaena, but +hospa/inena.
It is a foreign word, the first syllable of which has been treated, by
popular etymology, with vrddhi—a sure sign of antiquity—as if it
was Ir. hu- “good.” 12 hospa/inena is the adjective, but in Vid.8,90 the
noun is required. The surviving forms show that the fault is not in
the adj. ending, but the n before it, a mere vertical stroke: hvsp(n)yn
is the noun Tiusplna.
Gr. chalyps, Syr. sbvrqn, Aw. sprya ahena, also Assyr. habalklna

translation of "hospinena, polavaten, from polavat, > NP. puIaS [Ar

The early Arab poets call their famous swords regularly saif = hindu
wan, or simply hinduwani, “the Indian (steel, sword),” and formed
from this MP. word hindi, muhannad etc.13 The Shahnamah says: “ci
gopal, ci yanjar i hinduwan, what a sling-stone, what a dagger of In
dian (steel).” Marco Polo still speaks of this steel as “ondanique.”
The country of provenance is Sind. The oldest remarks about steel
in India are partly contradictory. At Doriscus, in 480 b.c., the Indians
had iron arrowheads. Ctesias, bid., Photius 72, reports having received
from each, Artaxerxes and Parysatis, a sword of Indian iron. Curtius,
9,8,1, says, Alexander got from the Oxydrakai a hundred talents of
ferrum candidum, an unusual expression, hardly meaning tin, rather
steel. But Strabo 15, c.700 and 716, quotes Nearch and another his
torian of Alexander saying that the metallurgy of the Indians was
behind the time, that they did not even know how to harden bronze
by hammering, which would preclude the making of steel.
Pliny, after dealing with Spanish iron, in 34,39-46, says: “The best
is that of the Seres, Chinese; then the Parthian,” which would be the
sprya from Suburgan. The Peripi us, at the very end of the first century
a.d. speaks of the shipping of Indian steel from Ariaca (?) on the Gulf
11 O. Laufer, Sino-Iranica 15, traces also Chin, pin Pie to the same MP. source; the Chinese got the thing and the word from Iran, and describe it as damask steel, encrusted with gold in China. The sign “pin,” created for this word, stands for +spin. 12 Cf. husravah:hausravaha; humanah:haumanaha; and their antomms dussravah:daussravah; dusmanah:dausmanahya. 13 See Siddiqi, Pers.

of Cambay to the Somali coast. 14 Under Marc Aurel and Commodus,
Indian steel was common among the import articles subject to custom
duty. At the limit of modern times, damask blades, the iron of which
came from mines near Hyderabad, were forged in Golconda and in
Guzerat in Panjab, on the way from Lahore to Kashmir. This is not
far from the town Proklais, which the Periplus describes as the great
trading center of NW India. The name is older Gr. Peukaleotis, from
Pali Pukkhalavatl, mod. Charsadda, only 12 fz miles NE of Peshawar.
I consider MP. polavaS to be an adjective of provenance “from Puk
khalavati,” and Tedesco informs me that this is right, the vrddhi adj.
pokkhalavata exists, > pohalavada > polavaS, NP. pulad “Indian
(steel).”
As famous as the saif hinduwanl in old Arabia were the gladii his
panienses or hispanici, swords for cut and thrust, in Rome. The Spanish
mines are situated near the southern coasts and the metal is above
ground and easily workable, all the advantages shared by the mines
of the Chalybes on the Pontus. Therefore, Spain has furnished metal to
the Mediterranean world since the remotest antiquity. This trade
flourished before the Mycenaean epoch; after the beginning of the first
millennium it was the Phoenicians that carried it. Ezekiel 27, 12-13,
Lament on Tyre: “Tarshish has brought . . . silver, iron, tin and lead,
Yavan, Tabal, Meshek have brought their slaves and tools of bronze to
thy markets.” For the Tarshish trade see under ‘Navigation.’ The As
syrians heard of the Phoenician trade with the ‘Tin-islands’ under Sar
gon, at the very end of the 8th century. In the 7th century, the Phoeni
cians went to Spain as well as to the Shaft al-‘Arab. At the end of the
6th century, Scylax of Caryanda reported to Darius about his voyages
from the Indus to the Pillars of Hercules. Since 450, while the metro
poles Tyre and Sidon were Persian cities, the Carthaginians began their
intensive colonization of Spain. The Greeks called the country Iberia,
after a tribal name. The Romans who wrested it from the Carthaginians
in the 3rd century did not use the Greek name, but Hispania, perhaps
older Ispania. Therewith they did not invent a name, but adapted the
name used by the Carthaginians. One need not accept the old story
about a Punic etymology of that name, but cannot doubt that it was
14 IdrisI 1,65 says, vice versa, that the smiths of Sind got their iron from Sofala.



INDUSTRIES 791
the name, presumably, like Iberia, derived from a tribal name to which
Hispalis-Sevilla may belong.
Polybius, Diodor, Justin, all mention the Spanish swords, gladii his
panienses. Seneca calls them hispanae machaerae. Philo, the mathema
tician, discusses their extraordinary elasticity. Martial and Pliny name
Bilbis and Turasso as the most famous places of fabrication; Grattius,
cyneg., names already Toledo, where the industry flourished to our
time: I have here a fine Toledo dagger of 1859. Besides the gladii and
machaerae, short-stalked hatchets and double-axes were made, and these
are represented on the oldest Spanish coins and on vase paintings as
symbols of that typical industry. They are also the “thousand cakusam
hospinenanam biteyanam” of Yr.10,128, on Mithra’s chariot and huspin
is “Spanish (steel).” The appearance of the word in the sixth century
in the Awesta is the effect of the Phoenician trade. “A sword of Spain,
the ice-brook’s temper.”
Tiospinena appears for the third time in Vid.8,81-96, in rules for the
purification of fire: profaned by industrial utilization, it must be
brought back to the temple, the datiya gatu. Such rites seem to be the
last echo of a paleolithic thought: to keep the flame and never to let it
die out. The rules are arranged in the grade of profanation, a coloring
foreign to the original thought; the form is: How high a merit does
he acquire who brings back the purified fire to the cultic place? The
merit is graduated from thousand to ten points, similar to the grades of
the wergild tariff in Yt.io, see under ‘Mithra.’ There, a faulty 10,000
grade is appended at the end, a relation of redemption “between the
dena mazdayasnis” which, as a single one, cannot appear in dual. The
list of fires, likewise, begins with a faulty grade of 10,000 points for
fire that had been used for funeral pyres. The preceding paragraphs

see under ‘Videvdad’—give an explicit rule for such desecration, sepa
rated from the list of industries only by the unorganic interpolation:
“If one puts sandal, benzoe, aloe, pomegranate and other fragrant
woods on the fire, Atar comes here at once, wherever the perfume
spreads.” One sees clearly the work of the redactors collecting the old
fragments: the fire of a funeral pyre is repeated in st.81 merely in order
to connect stylistically the disconnected rules about pyres and about
industrial utilization of fire. The 10,000 post must be cancelled.



INDUSTRIES

If one would get ten points credited for every time one carries the
fire from one’s own hearth to the datgas, but a thousand points for
doing it from a dyer’s place, everybody would go once instead of a hun
dred times. The tariff-form is preposterous, and introduced only for
mnemonics’ sake, probably in the first century a.d., when the Videvdad
was composed. The genuine nucleus of the alleged tariff was a simple
ordinance of how to purify and maintain fire used in industries. The
date of the original rule, older than the Videvdad, could be inferred
only from the techniques, but just their age is the unknown quantity
which we wished to infer from the date of the rule.
The list begins with (82) grade 1,000: ruzdi.paka, (83) 500: ,saire.
hya‘, (84) 400: xumba zmani.pacika, (85) xumba yama.pacika; this
ought to have 300 points, but instead it says, ungrammatically: “as much
as (there are) for it of yamanam patinam sarinam, of single potsherds.”
(86) onya paro.brjya (or aparo-, -brzaya). Instead of 200 it says: “as
much as (there are) for it of single urvaranam, grains or plants, of the
fields.” (87) 100: pisra zaranya.sepa, (88) 90: pisra rzata.sepa, (89) 80:

All these works utilize fire, and all the names are adjectives “the
fire used for such and such a purpose.” They may refer, in principle,
either to the product, or to the apparatus of production, but not, as will
be seen, to the fuel.
Four words denote the apparatus:
(1) xumba, Pahl. transl. xumbak, OI. khumba, lit. “pot,” called thus
either for a similarity of form, or because, primevally, the wandering
smiths carried a pot as oven. Here it means the kiln of a potter (83)
and of a glass-blower (84). pacika, adj. of -pak, to Vpak- “to bake,”
shows that the material was burnt.
(2) onya, in 86 and 93, used for two undetermined techniques, onya
is derivative of una in Vid. 17,2; Nir. 100. This word looks as if it were
borrowxd from Akk. ana or unutu, Hebr. oni, oniyah “vessel,” ship
or receptacle. 13 The Pahl. transl. in Vid.8,86 and 17,2, ’vnk, recurs in
Vid.2,38 in the description of Yama’s var: “the dyv’l ‘wall’ with which
15 But ct. Gr. aulos. Lat. olla ; one would expect here the Ir. correspondent of OI. ukha “pot,” Gr. ipnoi “oven.”



INDUSTRIES 793
the ’vnk is shut,” where the Aw. text has “dvar, door.” In Vid.8,93 the
Ms. dr (dastur Rustamji) glosses “kimiyagar, of an alchemist,” as if
’vnk was a “still.”
(3) pisra, without clear etymological connections, serves for “sepa”
of gold, silver, bronze and steel, see §§87-90. The Pahl. transl. renders
this verb by adding ptkl or ptgl to each metal, while it translates pisra by
pyt’l. The only explanation I can offer would be that both transcriptions
mean *patigara > paSyal > piyal(ah) “dish.” Wb. translates sepa by
“schweissen, schmelzen,” to weld or melt, smelt, but one does not weld
gold and silver and was unable to melt steel or found iron. No other
technique is common to the four metals but “forging.” sepa must be
linked to Vsif- in Fzi.2,10, Yama myth: “he hewed, stroke the earth
with the wand,” and in Yt. 14,35 and 44-45, soldier’s charm: “hammer,
strike the body with this wing!” in order to become invulnerable. “To
hew,” OHG. houwan, is also in other languages the term for forging,
cf. OSl. kovaci, Lit. kalwis (Finn, kalewa) “smith”; Lat. cudere, cellere.
NP. sift “hard” apparently because “hammered, forged.” Cf. Germ.
Eisenhauer = blacksmith, Eisenhammer = iron-forge.16
(4) tanura is a loanword from Sem. tannura “baker’s oven.” (82)
Misled by an explanation—hi^r.pak—of the Denkjzrt, Darmesteter
translated ruzdipaka, name of the first industry, by “impure liquids;
hi^r is every impure secretion of the body”; hence West: “burning
of bodily refuse,” and Bartholomae “Fliissigkeiten kochend, zu Vrud-,
fliessen; Pii. roS?-pak; zum Kochen der aus dem Leichnam austreten
den Fliissigkeiten benutzt[es Feuer].” With but a little regard for the
context, these ghastly translations could have been avoided, ruzdipaka
is an industry, and the Pahl. transl. is clearly “ata;ys e rang.pak, fire for
color-boiling,” explained by NP. “wherever one boils colors.”
The etymology of ruzdi is unknown, and so is that of rang, often
spelled rg in BPars. Ctesias, Ind.21, speaks of a tree in India—confound
ing it with the ^siftahvara tree—on which small, soft wrorms develop,
red like cinnabar (OP. sinkabrus), utilized by the Indian dyers to
make a red dye of better quality than the Persian red. This implies
that red dye was produced in Iran in the fifth century. Cochineal was
known to the Assyrians as hurhuratu and as in.za.hu.ru.e.ti (which

language?) to the Babylonians at the time of Nabunaid. 1
' In modern
times kirm i qirmiz was cultivated in Khurasan. On the other hand,
the Phoenicians were famous for their purple, and the early predomi
nance of red suggests an etymological connection between ruzdi and
roSita “red,” perhaps also of rang “dye” and 01 . rakta “red.”
With indigo, nil, Pliny deals in NH. 35,25-27, as indigum, and the
Periplus says that it was exported, at that time, from Barbaricum, the
harbor of the Sinthos river, i.e. Indus, hence equal to + Sindrod (for
-ok) of the Acts of St. Thomas, and corresponding to mod. Karachi.
If it was brought to Rome, it certainly came to Persia at the time of the
Videvddd. Indigo industry flourished in Khuzistan in the Sasanian
period and has not yet been quite supplanted by imported aniline. From
the story in Mas‘udi’s murudj
,
that Xusrau Anosixwan received from
India the book of Kalila u Dimna, chess, and the black dye, called
hindi, to dye his hair, one must not conclude, as O. Laufer did, that
indigo was not imported before the 6th century a.d. Chess too came
much earlier. The story means vasmah, which, when used alone, gives
an ugly green-black, and hence, for hair-dying, is always used along
with hinna.
Weavers who used gold- and silver-thread—W.16,2 zarnena for rugs
and cushions, cf. mrzyumna in Yt. 17,18—had all normal colors at their
disposal. The sculptures of Persepolis show madder (rubia tinctoria)
and indigo besides saffron as colors of garments. For making the enam
elled bricks, according to Dar.chart.Sus., one used mineral colors like
kasaka kapotaka, lapislazuli, sinkabrus, cinnabar, axsena, Akk. sadanu,
haematite or perhaps ambergris.
The Bdh. says in the chapter on plants: “har ce yamak pads +ra(n)
gitan,13 cigon kurkum u dar.purnigan u zart.copak [K20, Paz. zacava]

Xvanend, all plants used for dying textiles, like saffron, sapan, yellow
wood, vahak?, madder and indigo, are called rang, dye-plants.” The
same plants with the same names—except the unknown vahak—were
used till recent times.

Wood was always scarce and precious, and dry dung, of horses and
camels, besides dry desert shrubs, is the most common fuel for lime
kilns, brick-yards, potteries, baths and even baker’s ovens, and was the
more so as long as coal was unknown. This same fuel was certainly
used for making dyes, and for most of the following industries, that
is one reason why it cannot have a special number of points in this
tariff: no fuel can appear at all. Vid.5 teaches: “If someone dies by
drowning or burning, it is not the water or fire that kills him, but
fate, baxt.” In the same way, the fire neither does nor suffers harm in
burning up any fuel. But no fuel has ever been used for kiln-drying
dung. The sun does it. Materially the interpretation is impossible; lin
guistically it rests on the Pahl. transl. sarasp interpreted as “horse
dung” and Aw. sarya, an absorbent, on which corpses are laid in the
daxma according to Vid.8,8.
A compound with *ahya, Germ. Esse, is wholly unconvincing, and
the dot of separation which some Mss. put between saire and hya only
shows that the redactors did not understand the word. If they thought
of Aw. sarya “dung” or the current ideogr. sry’ = vat, “bad,” the inter
pretation would be linked to that of ruzdi as hixr, and both to the trans
formation of the original ordinance into a tariff in degrees of contamina
tion: corpses—hixr—sarya. The original did not mention cremation at
all, spoke first of making of colors, then of other industries.
Darmesteter used a wrong argument against an old note by Framji
(cod. Mui about 1830) “fire of a bath”: “To use baths was forbidden;
according to Josua Stylites, Balash (484-88) was dethroned by the magi,
because he had founded bath-houses everywhere.” The reason was that
these baths were an institution obligatory for Mazdakism, and building
them betrayed the king’s inclination towards Mazdak.19 One may still
consider “bath” as a possible meaning.
The word ,saire.hyat‘ is corrupt. The var.ll. lead to sryhyt or sry[-]hyt.

missing or illegible letter, it must have been a consonant, e.g. s (almost

“glue.” As support one may adduce, with Mr. M. Gandevia, NP. sarg
“glue.” In MP. one would expect +slysk instead of sl’sp. It would be a
glue-factory. One may also consider NP. sirinj, “minium, red oxide of
lead.” If the fault was in the second letter r, one may reach the meaning
“bath” by the simple and more than once necessary emendation of r in
n
: V sna-, snaya- “to bathe.”
(84) and (85), the two ^umba, zmani- and yama-pacika, Pahl. transl.
zamlk- and yamik-pazan, are kilns for pottery and glass. To the first
the Pahl. Vid. adds c’lvkl’n, i.e. caruk, NP. caru and saru, Arab, sarudj
“maker of hydraulic chalk.” Still today one fills the space between the
pots in the kiln with limestone, which draws from the dung, a fuel
rich in silicates, the necessary percentage, and afterwards is mixed with
the ashes, as an excellent mortar. To “glass-blowers” the translation
adds a word DvPgyn’kl’n, which may be +avginak.karan “glassmaker. ’
(86), para.brjya is, like 93 taxarya, prepared in an onya, but from
urvara, some species of grain, as follows from the remark “as much as
there are grains.”20 Assuming b < v, in MP. pronunciation, we have
+ para.vrjya, which would be to +vrjya “rice” as para.homa to homa:
the simplex is the plant, the compound the drink, hence “rice-wine,
distilled in an onya. Megasthenes mentions rice-wine in Strabo i 5,i,53 :
vivi.LV S’ av opvl'qs avri KpiOivtov crwridevTas.
There were other alcoholic drinks besides wine, homa. The NP.
word is buzah, perhaps comparable with the name of the dev BujI.
Bartholomae translated xsuSra, xsauSri—which is used along with
yava “barley” or payah “milk”—by “akloholisches Getreide, etwa Bier.”
But the Pahl. transl. of Vid. 16,
y
comments it by “as < OP. as#ra,
grits,” hence “porridge of barley,” see under ‘Harvatat.’ The translation
“mit Alkohol versetzt” of x^auSri would imply that distillation of
alcohol—of course unknown—was known, payah xsauSri is NP. mast,
or, mixed with water, dugh, which develops alcohol, but cannot express
this fact in its name.
20 The Pahl. transl. renders mechanically para- by the ideogr. L*YN = pes, brj/zya by arzuk, “precious etc.,” the usual translation of a different series of words: Vbrg-, brx5a, brjyant etc., adding as third element -kl’n, also misspelled klyt’n, klye’n. “pes-arzuk” does not look like any industrial product and is problematical, but it prevents a connection of para.brjya with MP. brejan “to roast, bake,” XP.

(87)-(9o) are clearly workshops where gold, silver, bronze and
Spanish steel were forged. The imported material was manufactured at
home. The charta of Susa adds to each imported material “tya ida
krtam, which was worked here.” All the copper bazaars of the East
work today with imported copper. Till about 50 years ago, the damask
steel for the Isfahan workshops came from Qazwln (near it was
QahvaS-Kitpat, a settlement of Kizvatnians), from Arsinjan in Fars,
from India and Europe. Mining ceased long ago in Fars. The steel is
inlaid with gold thread, hammered into the scratched patterns, and
made one mass by long polishing. The Chinese describe their work on
“pin the, the Spanish steel,” similarly: “swords and other objects made
of this steel, are polished ‘by means of’ gold threads, and then the pat
terns (of the damask steel) become visible,” following Laufer’s trans
lation which cannot be accurate: the threads themselves must be pol
ished to become visible and contrast with the wavy lines of the steel.
Ya 14,27 mentions a “karta zaranya.sora, dagger inlaid with gold”;
thus the technique was known in Iran at the Achaemenian period.

: tanura. Today and certainly in antiquity, in these round ovens
the round white dough of inferior bread, nan i taftun, are laid on sand

the fuel is dry dung, and the bread takes something of the smoke and
smell of the fuel. A yet more primitive method is one, the picture of
which I never forget : a beduin woman on the march, high on her camel,
holding on the fingertips of her left hand a round hot copperplate, on
which were heaped, alternately, 12 flat cakes of dough and of camel
dung, the top covered by another copper plate. Thus she baked her bread
while traveling.
The better bread, nan i sangak, is laid on pebbles; the fire leaps down
on the dough from a raised bench. The NP. commentary to the Videv
dad says: “tannur ki deg darvandan pazand, wa nan-puxt.” darvandan
means, like darbast, “with closed door,” but if that is written, the neces

schmann, Vers.Stud. 65: “NP. deg < OP. *daika,” means “not to

tions. The Pahl. transl. takes dista as the hearth of the kitchen, but this
is ruled out by the last item of the tariff: the hearthfire of the home,
nazdista. The disposition of the chapter requires another industrial fire,
and I believe it to be a charcoal pile. The much used charcoal is called
zuyal, zugal, zuwal, zuyal in NP., the etymology of which is unknown.

Dastur Hoshang and M. Gandevia comment upon its Pahl. transla

NP. klmiyagar, “of an alchemist.” The contrivance is the same as that
used for making para.brjya, seemingly a still.
As the text stands, ryry is adj. of tyr, "ta^ra > MP. taxr, in S\and.
Gum. Vic., Paz. tahal, NP. talx “bitter.” “Bitters” are medicinal drinks;
the main medicinal herb was dramna, absinthe, wormwood, see under
‘Ardvi.’ taxriya would be a bitter infusion, a tisane, Gr. irTurdvr). The
common IE. root to which the Greek word belongs describes the work
ing of primitive hand-mills, mortars with pestle, pistillum ; pistor, Pali
pisaka is miller, tila.pisaka “oil-miller” appears at the side of medicine
makers. pistlkan, the Pahl. transl. of taxriya,21 can belong to this root,
cf. 01 . pista, NP. pist “flour, meal.” Tisanes as well as powders, salts,
may be included under the notion. But all this rests on the interpreta
tion of “bitter” as medicine.
A slight emendation would give +sxry, saxarya “sugar.” Skr. sarkara,
Prakr.Pal. sakkhara means primarily any granular, powdery material,
a name fit for medicines in crystalline powder form. It is qualified by
rakta or aruna “reddish” or by sita “white,” which seems to me to
narrow down the meaning to sugar at an earlier time than generally
assumed. I do not believe that sugar became known in Iran only in
the late Sasanian epoch.
21 The variants of pyst>k’n differ only in the spelling of the adj. ending. But the text glosses it by a second word p-yy’-s-p-yk-’n with three variants: two insert -’h after initial p, one of
them ligating s + p to sc, the other with only p for s + p + y; the third variant put -’hbetween the second p and yk. Only one of the variants is possibly right, but I am unable to divine the word behind them.

The classical references to sugar show that it had been a medicine
before it became an article of general consumption, just as pontikon
coffee and xsiftahvara-manna. Sugar-cane grows in SIstan, Gurgan,
Khuzistan and ‘Iraq. Nearch and Onesicritus mention, in India, “a
reed producing honey without bees”; Megasthenes says peki xaXd
fuvov ; Pliny nh. 12,17: “saccharum et Arabia fert sed laudantius India,
gummium modo candidum, dentibus fragile, amplissimum nucis avel
lanae magnitudine, ad medicinam tantum usum.” Applying these de
scriptions of sakkhara, as usual since C. Ritter’s dissertation, to Indian
“bamboo-manna, tabasir < Skr. tvakslra, bark-milk,” involves the as
sumption that this stuff had originally two names of which one was
later transferred to sugar-cane, or, yet more improbable, that it got a
new name when its old name was transferred. Besides, Pliny’s Arabia
must mean the Shatt al-‘Arab region; as far as I know, sugar-cane is
not indigenous in South Arabia. Dioscurides, at Nero’s time, describes
araK^apov as found on a cane, looking like salt—most characteristic:
who has never taken the sugar instead of the salt-cellar? The Periplus
§14 mentions aaKxapi as export article from Barygaza at the very end
of the first century a.d. The method was still primitive, the use limited
to medicine.
The perfected production of sugar is said to have been found in India
itself only about a.d. 300. But at the time of Moses of Chorene, a.d. 450
500, Gundeshapur in Khuzistan was already the center of sugar refin
ing; books like Xusr.Ret. speak of two kinds, sakar and tabarzaS, the
names of which passed into many languages, not as of something new,
but as a common requisite of the kitchen. The Sui-Annals22 mention
not much later two kinds of Persian sugar, and in the T‘ang period
those were imported wholesale. Sugar was not “an Indian valuable”
because the emperor Heraclius mentions the enormous stores of it
which fell into his hands with the spoil of Dastagird. Xusrau, like more
than one of his successors, who are accused of it, apparently used the
war for financial speculations. In 1917, at the evacuation of Baghdad
by the Turks, I observed how ten railway trucks loaded with sugar

which had completely disappeared from the market for a long time

occupation.
The last three fires of the list are not industrial.

: “pantat haca stora.payat, Pahl.Vid. ac ras . . . e storpanan.”
stora is big cattle, Vpa- “to herd.” panti does not mean exceptionally
“Stelle, spot” (Wb.), but as always “trails” between summer- and win
ter-pastures, along which the cowboys make their fires.
(95)
: skarya, Wb. “eine Art (welche?) Vorrichtung zur Feuerung.”
But Pahl.Vid. has “skly’ (ku s6/3an),” or “ski . . . e ’svb’l’n (e xb’d
nan),” with the NP. gloss “hunters in the forest.” Pahl. skly’ is a mere
transliteration; the words in brackets “shepherds,” express opposition
to the foregoing “cow-herder.” The variant explains skar as “of the
horsemen,” with an impossible gloss “Chionites,” as if thinking of the
desecration of the fire by enemies of the religion. Hiibschmann, Pers.
Stud. 30 and 80: “NP. sikar, also bisgar(d), ‘hunt,’ MP. skar from
OP. *skara, to Vskar-; bisgard < MP. viskar.” skarya is the adj. of this
*skara, hence “fire of a hunter.” The gloss is right.23
Finally (96): “who carries the fire nazdistat haca datiyam gatum
avi, from the nearest (place) to the cult-place.” Pahl.Vid. ac nazdik
(sapistan). Wb.: “vom nachstbesten, abgesehen von dem vorher aus
driicklich genannten,” which would be the fire of minor importance,
whereas it is the best of all and the least profaned, sapistan, “Harem,”
defines it as the hearthfire of the own home, and that is what it means:
agni-ignis, the fire of Vesta, earlrj.
The sequence, therefore, is in reversed order: fire used (1) on the
own hearth, (2) by hunters, (3) by cowboys, (4) for making medicines
or sugar, (5) charcoal, (6) in baking ovens, (7) for forging steel, (8)
brass, (9) silver, (10) gold, (11) for making rice-wine, (12) glass,
(13) pottery, (14) glue, or for baths, and (15) dyes.
23 Cf. the n.pr. skarayat.ra 0a, Wb. “den Wagen kreisen lassend to skarna ‘round’.” So it
would be if it were a comp. adj. of common language, but it is a proper name, standing in yr.13,108 beside darayat.rafa, frarat at.rafla. As a name it may be formed merely in imitation
of such forms, and mean “hunting on the chariot, chariot-hunter," which was the usual style of hunting.



XLIV. ARCHITECTURE
Usam sriram yazamade!
The number of Old Iranian terms for arts and crafts, architecture
and sculpture, is large, but few have been accurately determined. Ety
mology alone cannot reveal the peculiar meaning, and any thorough
investigation ought to be linguistic and archeological at the same time.
Only a few terms can here be discussed.
All arts, each peculiar skill, is hunara, n.abstr. hunartat. Darius calls
his sportsmanship as horseman, archer, lancer “hunara granted to him
by AhuraMazdah” ; Zoroaster calls his poetry “hunartat, bestowed by
Vahumano.” AhuraMazdah’s creating of the world is “hunartat,
Srifuovpy'ui.” hunaravant, “rich in hunara” is the exclusive epithet of
two women in the Awesta: (i) the maiden of the Cinvat-bridge, who
guides, with a rope, the souls over the abyss, on account of her special
skill; and (2) Usa-Eos in Y/.i6,i, as goddess of handicraft, huti. The
craftsmen which are dra^ta.hunara, have learned their trade, are under
the protection of the hunaravatl.
In Altp.lnschr. (s.v.) I had not yet found the etymology of hunara.
“Good-man,” of course, is a popular etymology only. Nyberg’s “gute
Manneskraft”—in view of Usa and the maiden of the Cinvat-bridge, is
funny. H. W. Bailey’s remark in jras 1943, 2 “hu.nara ‘skillful, skill
from hu- and the verbal base nar- ‘be strong’ (not from nar- man
directly),” is perhaps meant to improve my surmise “ V nar- in MP.
vinartan etc.,” but is equally wrong.
The etymology results from hvandra.kara, the epithet of the dog in
Vid. 13,'6 and 48, see under ‘Ardvi.’ In Vid. 13,8 and 42 his epithet is
draxta.hunara, and F/^.13,9 remarks “a vohunazgo, hound, is enough
for a man who wants only protection, but no special hunara.’ Hence
it is not a (Wb.:) “luxury dog doing tricks,” but on the contrary a
working dog that has learned his job. In primitive periods all crafts were
in the hands of bondsmen, slaves, vesa, many in the hands of women,
jahika, e.g. weaving, pottery, cooking, perhaps also gathering herbs and
making medicines. That is the point of comparison between the dog
and the vesa and jahika in the song Vid. 12,46-48.



802 ARCHITECTURE
hvandra.kara and dra^ta.hunara are full synonyms, hvandra—with
euphonic d 1—corresponds to OI. sundara < *sundra < *sunra, and
hunara to OI. sunara. It is no compound at all, but a derivative of A hu-.
This does not mean “antreiben ( Wb.)” based on arma.suta and manyu.
suta, both in fact to V syu-,2 but “to produce with skill, handi-work.”
Gath, hunati in Y.31,15 and hvanmahi in Y.35,5 mean “to manufacture,
contrive (by intrigue) the rulership of somebody.” And yona.hut,
epithet of the fox in V/d.13,16, is “the one who builds his den with
skill.” In apa.hvanvati, Yt. 14,46, the primary signification, producing
by magic, is still discernible.
hvandra has a shortform hvani- used in compounds:3
(1) hvani.saxta, Yt. 10,109, see under ‘Mithra’; saxtan, saz- is the
word for many crafts, replacing OIr. -kara, -gar, especially for forging
of weapons, making harness etc.; the NP. vocabulary is rich. Hence,
the saxta are weapons and engines, artillery, Vhu- “to engineer” and
“artes.”
(2) hvani.strta, -strtu “skillfully upholstered,” cf. Athenaeus on the
Persian invention of mattresses under ‘Hospitium.’
(3) hvani.rafla, name of the middle krsvar: the Veda praises every
where the high art of the Cartwright, of making the wheels of the
chariot. Bartholomae 4 interpreted the passage in rv. 6,61,13: “ratha iva
vibhvane sarasvatl - - krtah” by “the Sarasvatl looks like the
chariot wrought for Vibhvan,” who as son of Sudhanvan belongs to
the Rbhavah, sandhanvanasah, the famous Cartwrights “who made the
chariot of the Asvinau.” hvanira#a belongs to this sphere of thought
and means “with chariots skillfully made.”
hvanat.caxra in Yt. 17,1, standing between yuxta.aspa “harnessed
horses” and vrta.ral9a, “turning chariots,” looks like a full synonym;
ra#a = caxra, as in caxravant “with many chariots.” canat.caxra in Yt.
5, disfigured from hvanat.caxra (Sas. c = hv) refers to mills in the
kitchen and means singing wheels.” But if the wheel of a chariot

would “sing,” it would soon burn, and the epithet would lay bare the
lack of skill.
hunartat is the word comprising all S-rjfuovpyia at the creation of
the world. Where gods create single beings, various words are used,
the primary meaning of which is mostly hidden. So it is in other lan
guages: the prehistoric Sumerian town bad URUD.NAGARkl = Bad.Tibira
was, as the name says, a settlement of coppersmiths, who were miners
from the Pontus, Tibareni. But in Naram.Sin’s inscription Ur. n° 276,
the “nagar who chisels off the inscription, changes the name” is a
mason. Which craft the lu NAGAR.izzi of the Hittite Code means, re
mains unknown. In later times the naggaru, Arab, nadjdjar, is a car
penter. The problem is not to find a meaning for the root which covers
all these applications : it is the effect of historical developments that the
names were transferred from one craft to another.
Y^.19,52: ApamNapat “creates men, carves, tatasa men.” Vtas- is
etymologically connected with tect(onics), (archi)tect as well as with
text(iles). Weaving and basketry may be the primary meaning. In
y.57,10 it is building: “Sroso ham.tasti (cf. con-tegere), puts a (mod
est) house together for the poor.” A synonym is V dwars-, which Her
tel, Siegesf. 59, explains as “k‘-enlargement of the unenlarged root
dwar-, whence 'tvar.ta > 0warta (spelled #wasa), atmosphere, lit. sec
tion, space between sky and earth.” 0wars- appears beside Vtas- in
y.9,1. 0warstar, fhvarxstar is a word for “creator.” There is strong
reason to believe that the original craft was “turning,” not yet on a
lathe, but with bow and string. But pati.flwarsta in Y.57,27 means “en
chased (with gold).”
In Vid.22,1, AhuraMazdah “a.krnati, shapes by cutting” a house. In
Yt. 10,28 Mithra “krnavati, cuts” the “anffya, antae” of the house, which
under normal conditions were of wood, only exceptionally of stone.
Vkrt- later becomes the word for stone-cutting. Dar. Chart.Sus, 48:
“martiya krnvaka tye aflangam akunavanta, the masons who cut
(shaped) the stone.” For the other techniques described there the verb
is akunavasa, they made.” The NP. word is tarasidan, sang.taras
“mason,” lit. stone-cutter; Aw. krnvyat “he may cut.” Hence, akuna
vanta is Old Persian for Median krnva-, while the term for the profes

sion, significant for cultural relations, is Median, krnvaka. MP. r’z grwg
(with raz = architect) is “master-mason.” The Pahl. transl. is kirr.
enltan, with kirr < krn-; the MP. noun kirrokih < krnv- means not
masonry, but all “crafts and arts.”
Words derived from fra.may- “to measure out,” framana “(foot)
rule” belong to a younger and advanced period, framana.kara is one
who works with the rule, an engineer, as the muhandis, -diz, engineer
and architect5 in much later times. All this is huti.
No excavations to any extent have been made in Media, and yet a
few architectural monuments of the period of the Aryan immigration
are known in western Iran. These have little in common with methods
and forms that had been used in the Euphrates and Tigris regions for
three thousand years by that time. They show rather an indigenous
development to which the Iranians may have added some features
familiar to them in their original home.
It would mean nothing if the Assyrian annals “mentioned no tem
ples and no statues of gods in the region of Media,” as Nyberg writes;
for the annals stop in the moment when the Medes founded their
empire in 678 b.c., and they can only give a picture of what existed
as long as the Iranians were not yet in exclusive possession of the coun
try. But, besides, the assertion is wrong.
Sargon, for instance, says:6 “From Ulhu I set forth against the for
tresses in the province of Sangibuti (Sahand, Tawriz). . . . This was
the home of his temple which the kings of the past that were before
him had of old richly endowed.” Salmanassar III, a° 16 [Luckenbill
1,637] : “Adira, royal city of the ianzu (king) of Allabria, the beautiful
golden doors of his e [temple?], the treasures of his palace etc., I
carried away.” Allabria is Ardilan. TiglathPilesar III, a° 2 [Luckenb.
766] : “Mitakki ... in Ursanika, him, his wife, sons, daughters, gods,
I carried away.” The place lies between Kitpattia = QahvaS, W of
Qazwin, bit Abdadahi = Bidjar, and Kisisu, Hamadan itself. Personal
5 Mas‘udi uses Arab, muqaddir, from qaddara “measure,” for “architect.” The form muhandiz, with z, significant for etymology, occurs in dialects, in ibn al-Faqih, bga v,p.67, and in an inscription of 507 h., van Berchem-Strzygowski, Amiia n° 2, I.14: “al-muhandiz,” not almuqtadirfi] .

and local names are Iranian. These people were Medes, and the “gods”
were statues in temples.
The most important of these temples, rich in statues and ex-votos,
the Musasir temple, is more accurately described than any other build
ing in Assyrian literature and was sculptured in Khursabad.7 It is the
model of the oldest Iranian architecture, known to us by the rock
tombs. In Pasargadae I have excavated a temple of the time of Cyrus,
in Persepolis two of the time of Darius and Xerxes, and one of the
first diadochs. They are of two types, both so highly developed that
they are certainly not the first specimens. MP. literature places the
origin of many temples in legendary antiquity, following the tradition
of the temples themselves; this tradition contains a grain of truth. The
late Husravah legend imagines uzdescar, temples with idols, at the
time of the kavi kings in Media, and kavi Husravah, Cyrus, burning
these “nisem e uzdescarih, nests of idol-worship” with the help of the
Gusnasp fire. They were actually the fire temples of the pre-Zoroas
trian deva, uzdes, which Xerxes calls devadana. The Arabs commit a
similar error in calling pre-Christian temples of Syria “fire-temples.”
In fact, the aSar Gusnasp, “Fire of the Stallion,” in Cecist-Sez, was the
greatest of these alleged idol-temples. The aSar Kavatakan, “Fire of the
Colt,” memorial fire of the Median dynasty, after which the legend
calls the founder Kavat “colt,” stood in Agbatana, and counted 128
years, when Cyrus-Husravah deposed the dynasty. These two temples,
dedicated not to AhuraMazdah, but to two shapes of appearance of
Vrthragna, are the origin of the later term “Varhran fire” for dynastic
fires. A memory lingers in that name of the pre-Zoroastrian past. The
legend ascribes several foundations to Vistaspa, some of which may
belong to Darius; but Vistaspa was the founder of the fire, the memo
rial list of which is preserved in Yt.iy, this document is as conclusive
as a preserved portion of the most important part of the temple.
In Beh. §14 Darius uses the term ayadana, “place of worship, sacri
fice,” Akk. bitate sa ilani “houses of the gods” for the fire temples of
the Persian dynasty destroyed by Gomata: those were memorial fires
of Cyrus and Cambyses. The Tansar letter calls the illimited building
of temples during the Arsacid period a “novelty against the rule, fra

8o6 ARCHITECTURE
man, the ancient kings had established,” which allowed only one
patnam fire, with the name of the ruling king. Markwart8 recognized
OP. ayadana in Strabo’s “iasonia,” reflecting Median *(a)yazana. The
Greeks, when connecting their Medea of the Argonaut cycle with
Media, saw in these temples buildings of Jason, and proof for the
reality of their legend. One cannot maintain Herodotus’ assertion, the
Persians had no temples, not even when restricting it to the narrowest
Greek notion: the building as seat of the deity, embodied in its statue,
and as most conspicuous symbol of the “polis.” With the statues we
shall deal under ‘Sculpture.’
Two things make a settlement a city in the old Oriental conception:
the temple and the walls. The Iranian legend speaks of such fortified
towns. Kanha—see under ‘Notarya’—appears in Yt.5,54 as home of the
Turyan Vesaki “upa dvaram cafhusukam, apanatamam kanhaya, at
the gate, the forum, the faraway one, of Kanha,” verses that were bor
rowed from the epic in the fifth century b.c. The later legend, which
descends straight from the epic, not from the Awesta, makes Kanha
Kang diz the prototype of the “town with seven walls.” Iranian towns
with up to three walls are represented in Assyrian sculptures; seven
walls are legendary exaggeration. The Ayat\.Zam. (Messina) describes
the seven walls of Kang diz as consisting of iron, copper, steel, bronze
(brinjen), lapis (kasaken), silver and gold. The Gr.Bdh. 210 says:
“Kang has seven walls of gold, silver, steel (almast), brass, iron, crystal
and lapislazuli; it has 700 frasa^ (2,400 miles) of streets, 15 gates,
from gate to gate is a travel of a fortnight by carriage.” This was a
favorite motif: the legends of kavi Usan (Kavi cycle) and of Siyavuxs
copied it, and still in 1001 Nights (ed. Cairo 1,278) the daughter of the
king of the Djaza ir, has seven palaces of crystal, Chinese steel, agate,
silver, gold and jewels. Herodotus 1,89 transferred the same legend to
his Agbatana built for Deiokes, with seven concentric walls, the battle
ments, overtowering each other, painted in white, black, purple, lapis
blue, orange, the last two covered with silver and gold. Polybius’ descrip
tion of the real town disproves the story completely: Agbatana had no
walls at all, only a citadel, just as Pasargadae. Herodotus, taking the
8 Excurse in “Siidarmenien" 531-45.



ARCHITECTURE 807
legend as history, tones the material of the walls down to colors of
the battlements. But the material is the genuine notion, derived from the
Babylonian doctrine of the seven planets and their metals. Herodotus’
description and the appearance of the name Kanha in Y/.5 are almost
of the same time, and have the same source: verses of the epic which
existed in 450 b.c. The legend itself is much older, at least as old as the
time of immigration.
Under ‘Yama xseta’ we have discussed his “var,” described as a square
castrum, one tacarta = % of a mile length of the sides, the plan of which
resembles the castrum “qasr Balkuwara” in Samarra. It was a square,
caflrusuka, a word which assumes the connotation of “forum, market
place,” like Lat. quadrangulum, NP. carsu, see under ‘Notarya.’ To
build this var, Yama must first learn how to build, for before the “win
ters” came, men did not need houses in the paradisiac country. He
learns making sundried bricks, called (h)istis, Akk. libnate, NP. ;yist,
Arab. libn. In V/d.8,10 zmoistve va zarstve: the first renders zam + isti
“clay-brick,” the second is the burnt brick, also fayence, pottery—see
under ‘Industries.’ The OP. word for burnt brick was a loanword from
Babylonian; chartSus.: “ummanate sa agurru epusu, the craftsmen that
made the (enamelled) bricks.” 9 The notion that sundried brick was
the primeval building material is true.
var is a term of fortification, to V var- “to enclose,” like Aw. vara
(in compounds), TPars. b’rg, NP. barah “wall and battlements.” There
are several derivatives, like parivara, formed like parideza:diza, and
fravara, both in Vid.2,26 (Yama’s var), which survive in Iranian, Ar
menian and Syriac. An Arabic term basura, which appears in descrip
tions of medieval fortifications of Syria, is explained by ibn Shihna as
“the area outside a wall of a city, against which is built a wall, extend
ing between it and the ditch, and which one must pass when going out
of town.” Against earlier etymologies, van Berchem remarked in Notes
d’eptgraphie 43: “un mot persan, comme dargah” [which is “doorway”
and occurs in the same description of the Bab alNasr in Aleppo], The
meaning is exactly 7rpo'mxto>ta - Hence basura is MP. *pesvarag < pas
yavara, perhaps < pasyavari, avant-mur.

with the invocation of Mi0ra-Ahura and seems to be the oldest piece
preserved in the Awesta, time of the immigration, before 678, a house
is described:
(Thou, Mithra, lord of the village, art the keeper of the innocent)
yo stuna viSarayati who keeps straight the pillars
brzimitahya nmanahya of the high-built house,
stawra andya krnavati who timbers the strong antae.
The pillars, columns are called stuna, the antae a(n) 0 ya, OI. ata.
The Indo-European domus in antis therefore was the form of the early
Iranian house.10 The OP. inscriptions use ardastana for the colossal
monolith antae and for the frames of doors and windows, a word I
compared previously with Gr. orthostates, but its Akk. translation,
kuburru to kibru “border,” designates all framework of a house.
The single palaces are called OP. mana, Aw. nmana, Gath, dmana
(domus); a larger unit of them vid, Aw. vis, etym. = oikos, vicus.
Special types are apadana, a reception hall, tacaram and hadis, private
houses, and dvar is “gate.” From the last one, later dahliz and dargah
are derived. In the Awesta the distinction, clearly visible in the plan
of Persepolis, between andarun and birun, harem and serail, is expressed
by antara.arSam and xsa^ram, see under ‘Hospitium.’ In two inscrip
tions the word for staircase appears; Art.n Susa c: “[usta]c[i]nam tya
atfanganam,” and Art.m, Vers, “ustasanam a^anganam,” with an Aram,
s for OP. c, wrongly transposed into cuneif. s. In Awestic hu.awi.tacina
corresponds, epithet of Cista-Usa in Y/.i6,i “who makes ascents easy”
(before: hupai9 maniya, good paths) and in Yt.16,3 “hvatacina, wooded
mountains with well-made step-paths,” see under ‘Post and Travels.’
ustacina:tacara like uzdeza:diza; Aram, “astican degree, step.”
The palaces of Ardvi at all sea-shores which Yt.5 describes are fitting
descriptions of Persepolis: “with a hundred windows, sata.rocanam, a
thousand columns, hazahra.stunam, ten thousand beams, bevar.fras
kambam, ten thousand bevar.mistam( ?), ten thousand viSayanam, bat
tlements with loop-holes.” Not even the numbers are exaggerated: the
MP. name of Persepolis was sat.stun, the hundred columns, NP. sad
sutun or cihil minar, the forty pillars—forty is infinite—but it had
originally about a thousand columns, and certainly ten thousand beams,
10 Cf. Tor v. Asien fig. 7; iae figs. 310-312, 319-320.



ARCHITECTURE 809
battlements and more, rocanam is window in its original meaning, an
opening for smoke and light in the roof, Fr. lucarne, Germ. Dach
luke, very clearly so in the description of Yama’s var. I regret having
misrepresented this point in iae: the Achaemenian palaces, which have
only a few windows in the vertical walls, were yet not dark, but light
ened by such rocana in the ceilings.
mista is quite unknown, fraskamba is always the horizontal beam,
“covered by (deck)-beams,” not ( Wb.) “auf Tragbalken ruhend”; the
description proceeds from bottom to top, and has no pile-buildings in
mind, but timber-framework. To fraskamba, frascimbana belongs
"patiskamba > MP. padiskamb, Arm. ptskam(b) “cella porticibus ad
dita, porticus etc.” in Neo-Arm. “balcony,” i.e. NP. balaxanah “upper
story.”
Pahl.Vid. 2,26 (and elsewhere) renders Aw. (fra)skamba by ’skvp, or
’skvpk in 6,5, NP. askub; in an inscription at Isfahan11 I found ’sk’b.
The relation to the synonymous Ass. askuppatu, Syr. ’skvpt’, Arab,
uskuffah, is the more striking, as it is an analogy to Ass. quppatu, Arab,
qubbah,' Pers. gunbaS.
Synonym of fraskamba is Aw. fraspat > MP. frasp. Art.Vir.Nam.
2,11: “cigon xanak-dar ke haft frasp u stun-e andar nihat estat ke an
stun be stanend avesan fraspan oftenend, like the gate of a house, where
seven beams are laid upon one column only, who takes away that
column causes the beams to fall—thus is to us seven sisters this only
brother.” One can make a sketch of the door, it is the same as one sees
everywhere in Kurdistan. A second signification of fraspat “covering
(of textiles)” we have discussed, together with spaya^ra, under ‘As
tronomy.’ ‘parispat > parisp “wall, peribolos” is formed with pari
“around” instead of fra- “forth” from the same stem.
All these terms belong to an architectural style that uses timber
framework and walls of sundried brick, as the Assyrian annals describe
it in northwest Iran. They speak many times of the pillars and roofs of

fragrant wood, as something entirely foreign to their own style. When
I discovered the teak beams in the palace of Balkuwara at Samarra,
our carpenter described to me the various woods, always adding the
special smell as a characteristic besides grain, hardness and color.
With this type of architecture the famous tents of the Persian kings
are connected, which were all but transportable apadana. The OP. word
is not preserved, but MP. maskaparzen, Arm. maskapercan.12 Sebeos

chaitya, in Hajjiabad a pile of stones used as target. A derived meaning,
with a different preverb, “to cover” is attested by Mir. Man. ’b.zyn,
’b.cyn, material for garments, ’bzyngr “tailor.” Kurd, barzin is today
understood as “on the saddle,” but is not a caparison, but the common
covering of the horse’s back under the saddle, hence 'upari.cayana. It
exists also as loanword in Talm.Aram., once glossed by “originally
called (animal’s) skin, but now ‘cover.’ ” Thus, upari.cayana is the roof
of a tent, pavilion.
The Greeks saw them first when Darius and Xerxes used them on
their campaigns, a custom adopted by Alexander and the diadochs.
Athenaeus (539c) uses the term Supdipai for the enormous tents of
Perdiccas and Craterus. This, and Talm. “skin,” seem to support the
interpretation of the first element of maskaparzen as Akk. masku, OP.
maska(uva) in Beh. §18, El. transliteration mas.ka.[uw.wa]. But masku
is only the bag of skin, not a hide, and even hides would be a material
utterly unfit for roofs of even the smallest tents. Greek cr/oj^ “tent,”
later “scene,” is an unexplained loanword. It does not appear in litera
ture before the description of the Persian royal tents, and a connection
between them and the later “scenae frontes” has been considered. In
Akkadian, maskanu, from sakanu “to dwell,” occurs with the connota
tion “tent,” 14 and in spite of Athenaeus’ &i<f>0£pai and Talm. “skin,”

In Vid.2,26 and 18,74, frascimbana, with the verb frascimbaya, means
the beam or girder of a bridge, see under ‘ApamNapat.’ Akk. gusuru,
Arab, djisr, have the same double meaning, referring to a roof or a
bridge. The names are the same, because the construction is. Bridge
building was developed; the great highways for vehicles require num
berless small bridges.
Vid.14,16, in a senseless context, says: “bis hafta prtavo fra.rvisyoit
tarasca apo naviya, twice seven bridge-beams shall he roll over ditches.”
prtu, OP. *pr#u, is, like gusuru and djisr, the single beam which reaches
over a canal—of course not over a “navigable water.” The verb for the
movement “fra.rvisya tara, forth-turning over,” means to roll in such a
way that it spans the ditch. In Yt. 16,3, song of the caravan, huprflwya
afs naviya means, the ditches may have such “bridges,” not “fords.”
Solid bridges in brickwork, even over rivers as large as the Euphrates,
were known since the Neo-Babylonian epoch, and the more so pontoon
bridges. The word for these is pisa in Beh. §74: “[asjiyavam abi Sakam

ha[da kar?]a pisa viyatarayam, I marched against the Saka that
wear the tiara pointed, I reached the sea with the [army?] I
crossed it by means of a pisa.” This is the famous pontoon-bridge over
the Bosporus, built by Mandrocles of Samos, Herodotus iv,87s, cf. Poly
bius iv,43. The OP. version of the stela which Darius set up there, with
a list of edvea Trdvra ocra 7rep rjytla was later preserved in the Dionyos

Bartholomae: “die unerschiitterlichsten unter den sich anstemmen

The second part means “the most efficient beams,” i.e. of the greatest
bearing-power; the first is a variation of the same thought. Instead of
“most unshakable” it ought to be “least shakable,” but this meaning is
unsatisfactorily derived from adv. fraka- “forwards,” while all other
compounds with a priv. and prev. fra- are formed from verbal stems,

braces, vertically arranged in girder-systems; in bridges their place is

involve a gable roof. We, too, speak of “pillars of society” or “of the
church,” but this is different: only people who admired the skill of their
engineers, framanakara, could compare their “manes” with details of
construction, and the verses cannot be older than the high Achaemenian
period.
The terms discussed so far belong to wooden structure of western
Iran. Others prove, not less clearly, the existence of vaulting. In Pasar
gadae and Persepolis, where there was plenty of wood, arches appear
over doors in adobe walls, but no vaults over rooms. In the scantily
wooded East it may have been different, and the striking contrast be
tween wooden structure in western Persia of today, vaulting in eastern
Persia, while the plans of the buildings are the same, may go back to
high antiquity.



ARCHITECTURE 8l3
A term of vaulting is MP.NP. gumbaS “cupola.” Its etymology is no
longer doubtful, after Ass. gubbatu, archet. of Syr. qvbt’, Arab, qubbah,
has recently been found in tablets from Nuzi (Kirkuk, land Arrapha,
bordering on Iran), 15th century b.c. Unrecognized, the word stood in
the letter of franchise granted by Nebuchadnezzar I (1146-23) to Ritti
Marduk, the mar Karziapku: 16 “May Sumalia, the lady of the snowy
mountains, asibat reseti, who dwells upon the summits, kabisat qup
pati, who enters the houses . . . [not: who treads? beside the springs?]
punish all who offend against the stipulations.” The goddess sets her
foot into the houses like the Iranian Rtis. The Behistun rock was a
sanctuary of Sumalia, see under ‘Deva.’ The region bit Karziapku be
longed to Nawar which extended in width from the Paitaq pass to near
Kirmanshah, in length from Shahrazur towards Elam. In bit Karziapku
palms grew, hence it was a southern part. In these regions the qubbah
was the usual form of a house in the 12th century b.c.17
The Arab, term for barrel-vault, azadj, pi. azwadj, to which the Lisan
al- Arab ascribes a Persian origin, comes from Aram, ’zg’, as recognized
by Fraenkel. But this is not Iranian, but Akk. asakku = Sum. azag,
“e.azag = bit asakki, room of darkness,” i.e. cellar, vault, cf. Meissner,
Suppl. 12, olz 1916, 141. In the accurate description of the citadel of
Aleppo, ibn Shaddad (in ibn Shihna, durr, ed. Beirut 50), speaks of
“five dargawat (< Ir. dargah) with vaults, azadj, in masonry, and
arches ascending in steps,” and p.48, describing the satura, a deep well
around which turns a stair of 125 steps, he says: “underground, drilled
into the rock, with barrel-vaults, azwadj, that penetrate each other.”
Another term of vaulting is Aw. kamara, f., “belt, girdle”; TPars.
qmr “vault.” In Iranian we have kamara, kamrSa and #rikamrSa, in
Greek Kapapa, KapapSa, and Tpixapapov, moreover Kappapos
“homarus vulgaris, lobster”; Nord. humarr, Germ, hummer belong to
OI. kamatha < ‘kamartha, see under ‘ArdvI.’ In Skr. this last is the
name of the turtle, as an animal covered by a brain-pan, cranium, as is
Lat. testudo from testa (>Fr. tete, head). The calote-shaped shallow
drinking cup, a form everywhere attested since the Stone Age, cf. calote
du crane, des cieux, de la sphere. Nord. humarr = K<xppapos expresses

the same thought as its Homeric epithet oo-rpaKoSep/ro?, Lat. Crustacea.
Since the IE. root is represented in Greek, one need not assume that
these words are borrowed from Iranian ; on the other hand, the Iranian
words are old and genuine. That means that vaulting—not in square
stones and, as long as there was no mortar, only in sundried bricks

was known in Iran since highest antiquity.
zbarah in Vid. 19,4 and 11—see passages quoted under ‘Spitama’

zbar: “z’vrv’g’n zbr m’ wys, do not open the liar’s zbar,”18 and in

hence “serpentine.” Jackson translated “to meander,” i.e. Bartholomae’s
“Krummung” in the horizontal, but it may be vertical. The word is
apparently lost in NP., but may survive in the name of the town Uz
wara, za/awara, 2 fars. from Ardistan, where pre-Islamic ruins are espe
cially mentioned, perhaps the reason of the name.
It seems to have passed into Arabic as al-zaura; according to Yaqut
(1) name of the Tigris at Baghdad; (2) of the town of abu Dja'far, i.e.
the “Round Town” of al-Mansur, with the “Green Cupola,” allegedly
called so because the inner and outer gates were not axially opposed;
Yaqut says so against al-Azhari who takes zaura’; (3) as a name of
East Baghdad, alluding to the izwirar, declination of its qibla. al-Sadiq,
in Bakri 442, denies such a name of Baghdad at all; and asserts (4)
zaura’ was Ray, significant, because this is the town in which the Aw.

plays upon the words izwirar, muzwarr, relating to the “crooked” qibla,

of the bazaars, the broken passage of the dargah gates, or equally well
the high cupolas of the buildings may be the cause of the name.
The grammarians determine zaura’ as fem. of azwar, stem zwr “to
go lame, slant, limp, be crooked, curved.” The analogy between Ir.
zwar- and Arab, zawara is complete. Whatever the relation may be,
Aw. zwarah, MMed. zbar, may signify, like Arab, zaura’, the broken
entrance or the vaulted hall of the “palace of the father of Zoroaster” in
Ray .
19
19 This zbarah has the doubtful adj. drjya. The broken entrances are called “dargah,” in Arab, also durqa'a. ibn Shihna, dttrr 5 T, comments: “entrance room behind a gate, one makes a turn in it, ’rtfq, in order to enter the house or any other building.” dargah is a compound of
dvara + gatu; the syn. dahllz is OP. *dvar01ca, from dvarft-, deriv. of dvara, gate. I have dwelled
on the queer subject, as I suspect a very old cultural connection: if IE. *g’hvvel- > Ir. zwar

XLV. SCULPTURE
The oldest monuments of descriptive art preserved in Iran are the
Median rock-tombs and some gold objects of the Oxus-treasure. With
contemporary Assyrian and Babylonian works these share neither the
subjects nor the developed technique. On the Median tombs some sym
bols of gods and Median worshippers are represented, on the small gold
plates of the Oxus treasure also some worshippers, which however are
neither Medes nor Persians, but East Iranians. When I called them,
thirty years ago, Zoroastrians, this was not meant to answer a problem
not yet risen at that time, whether those Iranians were Zoroastrians or
not; the question was merely to distinguish the Median monuments
not yet recognized as such from other non-Iranian monuments many
centuries older. Today we must distinguish between the Iranian groups.
On the Median tombs, including the ostotheca of Sakawand, and on
the drawings of the Oxus treasure, the attitude1 of the worshippers is:
barsman in the lowered left hand, the right hand lifted with libation
jug. Possibly some pictures are drawn with sides reversed. The same
types recur in larger number among monuments of Seleucid and
Arsacid date. They are Iranian, but not Zoroastrian.
His own rite, Zoroaster describes in Y.50,8 : pari.gam-, circumambula
tion, ustana.zasta, with hands outstretched, and namah, prosternation
see under ‘Poetry.’ Duchesne calls it “office rituel” and “en quelque
sorte une doctrine a lui seul.” How genuinely Zoroastrian it is, is shown
by the frequent, improper insertion of the very word ustana.zasta in
Y/.io—see under ‘Mithra,’ by which the pre-Zoroastrian passages receive
a Zoroastrian coloring.
Atar, on the contrary, is worshipped in Y.62,1 “esma.zasta barsma.
zasta go.zasta havana.zasta, with fire-wood, barsman, milk, mortar in
hand,” and likewise Mithra in Vid.3,1. In Yt.5,12, the statue of Anahita
herself holds "batiyaka libation cup and barsman, according to her
peculiar rite, see under ‘ArdvI.’ But Darius and his successors, on their
tombs, are not represented like those worshippers, but like Zoroaster:
ustana.zasta, Ad ;yeTpa? avatr^div.
The most probable interpretation of the symbols on the walls of some
Median tombs is: Mithra in Sahna, AhuraMazdah, Mah and Anahita
1 Cf. IAE figS. 313-316.



SCULPTURE 817
in Qyzqapan. The shape of the symbols is derived from Assyrian ones,
cf. iae 20iff. The Achaemenian symbol of AhuraMazdah appears first
on the Behistun sculpture, in about 520 b.c. At that time, an artist in
Iran interpreted the old conventional form of a bird hovering above
the king as the divine protection. The symbolic bird unfolds its wings,
to overshadow the king who does everything “vasna Oramazdaha, Akk.
ina silli, in the shadow of the god.” In 1001 Nights, ed. Cairo 111,216,
one reads : “Solomon, son of David, peace upon both, ordered his hosts
of men and jinn and others to form a lane along the way [of Pharao’s
ambassador], and the monsters of the sea, the elephants, tigers, leopards,
all stood in double line along the road [from Egypt to Jerusalem], and
the birds of the sky unfolded their wings above to overshadow it.” A
similar thought made the umbrella a royal insigne, which appears first
with Sargon of Akkad, then with the late Assyrians, the Achaemenids,
the Sasanians, Abbasids and still today in India.
Against a criticism of the symbol like Nyberg’s “ganz ausserhalb alles
dessen was der alte Zoroastrismus ertraumen konnte, muss elamisch
sein” (362), it must be said that iconographic types are neither dreamt
nor invented. Changed interpretation is the normal procedure; it is
enough to recall Christ and Buddha types derived from Greek philos
ophers. The symbol of AhuraMazdah descends from the Assur-symbol
by the intermediary form attested in Qyzqapan, not from Elam. Many
other things came the same way from Assur (as distinct from Babylon)
by Media to Persis.
Another symbol is mentioned in yr.10,136: “The one wheel, evo
ca^ro, is of gold, and the stones are all-light, asanasca vispabama.”
ca^ra, IE. *kwek wlo, Sem. galgal, is every disk, kyklos. The year-date
13 of Ammiditana, first dynasty of Babylon 2 says: “asme gal.gal.la Mdu.
sa.a-ke su.nir.ra i.mah.e.sa e.babbar.ra.se in.ne.en.tu.ra, great sundisks
of agate, magnificent as an emblem, he brought into Ebabbar.” And a
late Haggada says, the mark of Cain was a galgal hammah, sun wheel.
In the vision Daniel 7,10, the “Old of the Days,” sitting on his throne,
has galgillohi, wheels of flames. Likewise the Cherubim in Eze\. 1,15-21
have each a wheel behind them, of the color of a beryll,3 shaped like
2 Cf. Ungnad, Datenlisten, in Reall.Assyr. n,i87f. 3 Akk. burallu, Pali veluriya, OI. vaidhurya, Arab, ballur, “rock-crystal.”



8i8 SCULPTURE
“wheel in wheel,” the utter circle, the “ring” set with “eyes,” Akk.
abanenu “eye-stones.” They are “immaterial,” reach to the sky, overlap
each other and move always with the Cherubim who are quick as
lightning, “for the spirit of the Cherubim is in them,” as parts of their
body they are subject to their will. All these descriptions mean a halo,
a nimbus, as the oldest symbols of Assur, time of Assurnasirpal, show
it behind the whole figure of the god.
The stones mentioned beside the one wheel on Mithra’s chariot were
formerly understood as sling-stones. But vispa.bama “(containing) all
light,” especially when in parallel with gold, defines the material asa,
n.pl. asanas.ca. asa, in OP. asa sarva, designates the “mineral” lead, in
Aw. with *siyrvya > siyurya.ci^ra “of garlic essence,” perhaps the
opaline or sapphire, ruby,4 hence asa alone is “precious stone.” In Yt.
15,15 the same word appears as adj. vispa.bamya:
hukaryat haca brzahat vispa.bamiyat zarnenat
“from the high Hukarya, (which is) of vispa.bama and of gold,” cf.
under ‘Sea.’ The high Hukarya consists of this material and of gold,
as the sky consists of almast = Akk. elmesu, or the Us.hindu of hvena
ayah. The wheel, the nimbus behind Mithra, likewise, consists of vispa.
bama. There is a folk’s tale of the carx i almas, diamond-wheel, in the
underground passages under the terrace of Persepolis.5 The names of
the great jewels, Koh i Nur, Darya i Nur, “mountain, sea of light” are
of the same type. Therefore, the stone is either the diamond or the ruby,
even higher valued than diamond in antiquity. Emeralds were also
known, Akk. barraktu, on a Babylonian tablet dated year 35 of Arta
xerxes I, 430 b.c.,6 Hebr. barkat, Gr. crpapay80?. These stones were
believed to be self-radiating, as proved by their shining at night.
The symbol retains the circle also in its Achaemenian form wheie the
bird predominates in size, see iae, pi. lxiii-lxiv. On the Kushan coins,
the gods Pharro (hvarnah) and ASar (Fire) have a flaming nimbus
behind the shoulders and heads. The Iranian interpretation of the halo
is evidently the hvarnah, circle of light and flames. Noldeke, Tab. 93,
quotes Morier’s story of a Persian prince, who, when first seeing the

Shah on his golden throne, cries “I burn!” adding: “It is the royal
majesty that by its glory blinds the novice.” In two very old myths,
preserved in Yr.14,19 and 35-38, Vrthragna assumes the shape of the
varagan bird, the quickest bird of prey. In Yr. 14,35, an old military
charm, it has the epithet prta.prna, “with wings unfolded.” The hvar
nah itself assumes, like Vrthragna, the shape of the varagan, and in this
shape it escapes three times, from Yama, who owned it; Mithra, 0re
tona and Krsaspa, each catch one of the birds. The poets who expressed
themselves in this way had pictures like those of Persepolis in their
mind.
Just where an aversion against anthropomorphic representation of
gods prevails, art is forced to use symbols. Not even the Semites who

where living alone—reject anthropomorphic representation more than
the Iranians did, forbade symbols ; on the contrary, they permitted them
because their magic force may produce good effects. And the Iranians
loved painting so much that even as Muslims they never kept the
prohibition of human representations.
Herodotus speaks as a Greek when he says the Persians did not have
statues of gods, and does not contradict thereby the existence of sym
bols. He wrote in 440 b.c. Already in about 400 b.c. Artaxerxes II, as
Berossus records, ordered statues of Anahita put up in the temples of all
the capitals of the provinces. Without hesitation we may add “and of
Mithra,” since Artaxerxes in his inscriptions invokes the two together.
Berossus did not mean to exclude other gods, since, in that chapter
(Agathias 11,24, Bonn p.117), he spoke of the Iranian gods in general,
also of Zeus (AhuraMazdah) and Heracles (Vrthragna); the Mylasa
inscription of Artaxerxes’ time adds to these gods, the tvx7) fiacriXicos,
the “kavian hvarnah.”
We have dealt with the description of the statue of Anahita in Yt .

under ‘Ardvf : it not only fits her colossal statue in the Taq i bustan,
but some words in the poem are explained by it. The statue is not
made after the poem, but is the last preserved example of a tradition
starting at the time of the poem.
The case of Mithra on his chariot is similar. The description—see
under ‘Mithra’—agrees with and becomes clear by comparison with
sculptures of Assyrian chariots with their garrison: warrior, charioteer

and one or two shield-bearers, or, when hunting, one or two lance
bearers, and an entire arsenal of weapons. Sargon of Assyria, Eighth
Campaign, 714 b.c., seized among the treasures of Musasir “a statue

pressed thus: With my two horses and my only charioteer my hands

rendering of the Urartaean text might be inaccurate. As a legend this

as king was to have a tvvo<; 'Kidivos made,” that means the Behistun

In India it is the sungod Suryas who appears on the chariot with
several companions. In the oldest sculptures preserved, 7 of the time of
Asoka, about 250 b.c., the sungod is accompanied by two women who
shoot arrows. Mithra is described standing between two women who
embrace him from his back, or standing hands high, uzbazaus, as token
of peace, and both attitudes correspond to Indian sculptures. In the
Asoka monuments the charioteer stands in front of the god on the
shaft before the chariot, and behind the god is the great sunwheel. In
Turfan paintings there are chariots of sun and moon; the color of the
sun is yellow or gold, of the moon white or silver, and the moon has
cows instead of horses, just as in Sasanian representations. 8 The relation
between the poem in the yasht, the Indian and the Sasanian pictures
is evident, and the gods were imagined as driving in their chariot
already in Aryan antiquity. The description of Mithra on the chariot,
like that of the statue of Anahita, is not a mere fancy, but had pictures
in mind. Such pictures were not Zoroastrian but Iranian.

Akk. usirtum—quite apart from the question of restituting [d]ista or
[pjista—renders OP. dida, wall of the fortress. I consider [d]ista as
obvious and [p]ista as impossible. In the short gap between usirtum and
ultu was nothing but a word corresponding to OP, ava, and the Akk.
text renders “wherewith the fortification wall was [made]” by “of the
usirtum,” which must—at all events—be identical with usurtum. Hehn,
in maog iv,79ff., defined this as “enclosure.” 11 Apart from this exact
rendering OP. dida, Akk. usirtum cannot mean “relief.” This is a mod
ern term for certain sculptures. It is used, with ellipsis, for sculptures on
background as opposed to free sculptures. Its origin is Ital. rilievo.
Properly speaking it does not even contrast sculptures on background
to free sculptures, but it distinguishes between low and high projection
from the background: an artist does not make “a relief” but a sculpture
in high or low relief. The modern use of the term is negligent and
doubly elliptical: no antique language can have had a corresponding
term. OP. distinguishes no more than NP. between sculpture on back
ground and free sculpture. I remember when we invented12 NP. bar. =
gasta “projecting” as modern expression for the notion “en relief.”
The existence of a number of names of human, animal or hybrid
adversaries of the epical heroes in the Awesta and of the many hybrid
animals in Achaemenian art poses the problem whether some of them
can be identified. Archeology can trace the iconographic types through
Assyria back to a Mesopotamian and Sumerian origin. But of this the
artists that made them and the onlookers that admired them were
equally unaware, and they certainly did not see in the sculptures an old
Assyrian heritage, but figures of their own legend.

The hero who fights in Persepolis three of four such monsters
descends from the old Akkadian Gilgamesh, and the Iranians prob
ably saw in him Krsaspa who, in the epical fragments preserved, fights
the greatest number of adversaries. Their names are given, but almost
no description. The two descriptive adjectives of SnaviSka, +srvi.zangra
+sanga.gava “with shanks of lead, hands of stone” do not indicate the
shape. Only the name humayaka with epithet astakana, indicating an
ithyphallic monster dwelling in a cave,13 means apparently a dragon,
“Lindwurm,” and his second epithet prta.cinga “with out-spread claws”
is typical for the Persepolis monsters.
At the main gate of Persepolis and at the front of the Hall of a Hun
dred Columns stand the colossal human-headed bulls; “lamasse” is the
Akk. name of these tutelary genii. On a golden signet ring of the Oxus
treasure, n° 105, certainly not younger than the time of Alexander, such
a lamassu is represented, with the legend va^su, Oxus, apparently as the
tutelary genius of the river. On late Sasanian copper coins from Old
Shiraz and Bishapur, they appear with the legend (Rv.) (azat)-bus
nasp, i.e. Persian for Median gusnasp, name of the famous “Fire of the
Stallion” and shape in which Vrthragna appears. Even if this word on
the coin would be the patronym of Dara (a governor of Fars?) on the
Obv., the picture of the lamassu would still symbolize the name.
A song in Men-xr. 62 describes the mythical Gopatsah as such a
lamassu:
gopatsah [-] pat eranvez Gopatsah [is] in Eranvez,
andar kisvar e xvaniras in the kisvar Xvaniras,
ut ac pay[-]du ta nem-tan gav from the feet to his middle he is a bull,
ut ac nem-tan ac.par martom, from his middle upwards he is human,
hamvar pa draye-bar nisast and always sitting at the sea-shore
izisn e yazdan me kunet he is worshipping the gods.
This description distinguishes Gopatsah from the Persepolitan la
masse by its upper part being the full body, not only the head of a
13 Ct. Y/.i9,8o: KJiamnam may! fravoit. The verb fra.bav- is not, ^.1141 “vor sich gehen, stattfinden," but “vorwarts werden, erigi.” Hertel translates “sichtbar kam (ihre Lust) zum Vorschein.” Maya is phalios, as in OP. uz.maya.pati, Pahl. uzmah(var) “ithypallic,” Mir.Man. 1, to, ct. ami. 11, St and Altp.lnschr. s.v. mayuxa. The signification of uzmayapati explains itself by Assyrian sculptures and by the last story in the {it. al-Aghani 21,280: “In Sigistan was a man called Burzen, an ascetic, whose father had been impaled, suliba £l khirabihi. Abu 1 -Hindi, the men with the quickest repartee of the world, to whom he reproached his wine drinking, said: ahadkum yara 1-qadhat fi ‘ain akhihi, wa-la yara 1-khashabah fl ast abihi.”

human, and from the Greek centaurs by its lower part being a bull, not
a horse. The Persepolitan type preserves the archaic form, which can be
followed, by way of Assyria, to Subaraean Mesopotamia. But pre
cursors of the Greek type appear in Mesopotamia from the middle of
the second millennium.14 All the varieties may be classed as centaurs.
Gopatsah is a centaur, as are the lamasse of Persepolis. The Gr.Bdh.
197 identifies him with Ayrera0a:
ayrerat pasangan Aghrerat son of Pashang,
pat andar.kangistan is in Andar.Kangistan
u.s gopatsah xvanend and they call him Gopatsah
I leave the question open whether gopat.sah < gava.pati + sah, is a
political title—cf. the equally dark kangopat < Tanha.pati in the Sar
Mashhad inscription—or the designation of an office, a special activity.
The genealogical chapter of the Gr.Bdh. 231 makes father and son of the
two names: “Ayrerat begat Gopatsah. When Frasyap had captured the
Iranian army under Manuscihr, the gods granted Ayrerat’s prayer, to
free the army. Therefore Frasyap killed Ayrerat, but for a reward he
became the father of Gopatsah.” The reward motif is the same as in the
tale of the first three Homa-pressers. Dissecting name and surname into
two persons is so frequent in Iranian legend that the identity of both
was certainly the original condition: gopatsah is a title of Ayrera 0a.
Y/.9,i 8 contains no more than an allusion to the epic tale: Husravah
was the avenger of the murder of kavi Syavarsa and of Ayrera 0a; he,
perhaps also Syavarsa, is called “naravahya, son of Narava,” or—if the
inflection is thematic—of Naru, not of Pasang. Narava indicates an
original connection with Gr. Nereus. The unexplained name Pasangan
might throw some light upon the myth. In the Greek versions of the
Cyrus legend, Ayrera 0a appears under the name Agradates or Atra
dates, both equal to ‘agrairathas, in more than one way connected with
Cyrus-Husravah. In Dino’s version he is Cyrus’ helper. Ctesias calls him
Cyrus’ father. Strabo 15,3,6: “the river Cyrus (mod. Kurr), flowing
through the so-called Coele-Persis at Pasargadae, from which the king
took over the name, being called Cyrus instead of Agradates.” This

version contains something of the lamassu as genius of a river, as on the
early gold-coin.
Meillet disproved common descent of Gr. kentauros and Ir. gandhar
vah from Indo-European; 15 seen from the archeological side such com
mon descent is equally improbable. But Meillet’s reasons in no way
rule out the identity of the notion and the names. The type appears
in Mesopotamian monuments in the middle of the second millennium,
when the Mitanni ruled there. Thus a Subaraean word and notion can
have been transmitted to Iran and India, and, later, to Greece.16 The
Greeks assimilated the Sub. Hitt, original to “tauros, bull,” itself a
loanword; the Aryan form, too, is assimilated to their language. In Asia
Minor there is the Lycian name kntlapa (nom., kntlapah gen.).17
Bartholomae accentuated the different role of the gandharvah in
India and Iran. This again does not contradict the borrowing of the
hybrid type with its name from a common source. In fact, the role of
the Indian gandharvah is very indistinct. The Greek kentauroi are
originally wild creatures of the mountains, especially in Thessaly, 11.
1,26;: (j>T)pe? opecrKoxu, Thess. for d-rjpes. In the Homeric hymn, Hermes
steals, as a new-born suckling, the ten cows of Apollo and “drives them
away backwards, their heads turned toward him,” wearing himself oak
branches as sandals; Apollo, like an Indian, traces him, and says (19):
“these are actually the tracks of . .
.
oxen, but they are turned backward
to the flowering meadow; but these others are not tracks of men or
women or . . . wolves or bears or lions, neither do I recognize them as
tracks of centaurs . . . , whoever it be who made with swift feet such
monstrous tracks, incomprehensible—aina—are the tracks on this side,
and more so those on the other side of the way.” This does not sound
as if the centaurs, in that old concept, had horses’ hooves.
The Awesta tells little about the Gandarwa, only the fact that Krsaspa
defeated him, neither why nor how; that was described in the epic.
The passage of Yt. 15,28, a prayer to Vayus, in which Krsaspa swears
15 Introd.6, 369: “1. la place du ton differe; 2. IE. g ne correspond pas a Gr. k; 3. le premier a de gandharvah peut representer a ou o, mais non e, car autrement on aurait a 1’initiale J, et non g; 4. Skr. dh ne rcpond pas a Gr. t; 5. Skr. -arvah ne repond pas a Gr. -auros.” Cf. Wb. 493: “Ai. gandharvah nur laudich Aw. gandarwa entsprechend.” The var. II. in Yt. 5,38, 19,41, 14,123, lead to gndrp, which is also the MP. spelling, and which must be read gandarwa according to the OI. form. 16 Cf. the problem of katfwarfcai'flw*', varaTnahya and Herakles. 14 Cf.

to avenge his brother Rva^saya, murdered by Hitaspa, is followed by
the words: “Likewise asti.gafyo ahuris, likewise eva.gafyo patis,” (both
entirely unknown and perhaps corrupt),18 “likewise gandarwo upa.
apo, the Gandarwa at the water,” cf. upa yozanta karana “at the surfing
shore” in Yt.5,38 and pa draye-bar in MenJCr. The three “likewise”
might mean “the same verses with these other names.”
Yt. 19,41:
krsaspo yo janat gandarwam Krsaspa who slew the Gandarwa
yim zari.pasnam yo apatat viza- with the golden fetlocks (pastern),
fano with split hooves
mr^sano ge#a astvatis rtahya who destroys the farms. . . .
then:
yo janat hunavo yat pa#anaya
Like Yr. 15,28, this is a very short epitome of the contents of the epic.
Hertel, Siegesf. 126,9: “Die Metrik beweist dass die grammatische Un
form vizafano Verderbnis ist.” The meter cannot prove anything here
as in other quotations from the epics. There, the sentences were a nar
rative; into the yasht they were fitted as prayers, here by “yo janat,
who killed.” Neither are the words “yo apatat” and “rtahya” original
parts of the epic verses. Only “gandarwam yim zari.pasnam vizafano”
must belong to the original. The case may have been altered; mrxsano
ge#a is dubious; hence “The Gandarwa with the golden fetlocks, the
vizafano.”
Wb. takes vizafano as a part.Med. “den Rachen aufreissend.” 0rizafan
“with three mouth” is a genuine word; anu.zafano takahe in Yr. 10,38
I regard as a faulty compound: anu belongs to takahe, cf. drzi.taka.
vizafano is indeed corrupt. For “opening the mouth wide” one would
expect 'prta.zafan-; the meaning of the simple vi- is given by compounds
like vi.carna “bifurcation,” vi.bazu “fathom” (length from hand to
hand), vi.tasti “span” (from point of thumb to little finger). Vizafano
resembles fra.safa (for para.safa, with Hertel) and apara.safa, “fore- and
hind-hoof” in Yt. 10,125; pr^u.safa “broad-hoofed” in 10,47. *vi-safa
would be “with split hoof.” To classify animals according to the shape of
their feet is natural and general. Hiibschmann, Pers.Stud. 76 and 256,
pointed out the difficulty of reconciling MP.NP. sunb, sum < OP.
18 ahuris and patis seem to be titles, gafyo patis recalls gava.patis.



826 SCULPTURE
*su(n)ba, *sunpa, with Aw. safa. There seems to have been a second
form with nasal, which caused the corruption vizafana, with z for s
and nasal transposed.
The verses Yt.5,38 give little more:
gandarwam yim zari.pasnam the Gandarwa (acc.) with the golden
fetlocks,
upa yozanta karana at the surfing shore,
zraya vurukrtaya at the sea Vurukrtam,
atacani suram nmanam that I assault the strong house
druvato yat paffanaya [of the earth] of the broad,
skarnaya dure.paraya round one with the far-away ends.
The verses are introduced into the yasht by adding “yat bavani. . .
The epithet “with golden fetlocks” is the same. “At the shore” confirms
upa.apo “at the water” in Yt. 15,28; zraya vurukrtaya is metrically
faulty, because quoted in the original locative. Bartholomae-Wolff’s
translations of the following verses “dass ich das gewaltige Haus des
Druggenossen im Lauf erreiche,” and Lommel’s “dass ich hinlaufen
moge zum Heldenhaus des Liigners” are senseless and prove the text
to be corrupt. Hertel, l.c. 6, n.2: “Das Metrum beweist gegen Wb. 843,
dass nichts ausgefallen ist”; Wb.: “vor yat ist mindestens anha zmo aus
gefallen.” The inappropriate druvato has replaced anha zmo, but the
following words, “of this broad round earth” are disconnected with
the foregoing suram nmanam. In the original they were somehow con
nected with zraya vurukrtaya. a.tak is “attack, assault,” and of the whole
myth we have nothing but “I want to assault the stronghold . . .” which
is imagined at the seashore, and belongs to the Gandarwa. He had
golden fetlocks, split hooves, like the lamasse of Persepolis, hence the
lower body of a bull, like Gopatsah, and dwelled in a stronghold on
the shore, similar to the helpful centaur Cheiron, who sits on the water.
That is all the Awesta quotes of his myth.
Therefore it is entirely possible that the gandarwa is Ayrera0a, or, if
gandarwa is a generic name, that Ayrera#a was a Gandarwa, and that
these were imagined as centaurs, as in the description of Gopatsah in
the Meno\.Xrat.



XLVI. THE BOOK OF DANIEL
A relation existing between the sculptures of Persepolis and the visions
of Daniel has occasionally been mentioned, but never thoroughly
studied.
As we have it, the book of Daniel results from a redaction, made
under Antiochus Epiphanes in 175-164, and which adorned the biog
raphy of an historical figure with popular tales of miracles and visions.
Such visions, Akk. suttu, “dream,” belong to a literary type, of which
the “Unterweltsvision eines assyrischen Kronprinzen”1
is an older,
closely related example. The hero of the book, whom the Arabs call
“Daniel the Younger,” must be separated from the older Daniel of
Ezekiel 14 and 28, who is related to DN.EL of Ugarit. Daniel may not
be the real personal name of the hero of the book, but his surname is
historical. In 4,8 Nebuchadnezzar says: “Daniel who is called bfis’sr
according to the name of my god.” Marduk was the main god of Baby
lon, Nabu the personal god of the king Nabu.kudurri.usur “Nabu pro
tect my empire!”, who bestowed the honorific “Nabu.balatsu.usur,
Nebo protect his life!” In the book the indispensable name of the god
is suppressed as heathen; the suppression proves the historicity beyond
doubt."
In 2, story of the king’s forgotten dream, Daniel becomes soltan over
Babylon, and, on his request, his three companions become rab-signin
of the medinah: this is one and the same office, that of the saknu of
Babylon. They too receive honorific titles: “*bed-negd, sadrakh and
mesakh
, which however are not true to Babylonian type. H. Winckler3
had recognized that the last two are in reality one, and that there are
only three honorifics for four persons. In Daniel’s name nabu is sup
pressed, in Azariah’s name it is intentionally disfigured into nego, and
the third name is an equally intended disfiguring of +Mardukmesah,
cf. Akk. kakkab Marduk me.is.hu im.su.uh.
1 W. v. Soden, in Z.Ass. nf.ix, 1936. The name of the prince in this story is Kumma, and there are reasons to believe that he is Assurbampal as heir apparent. 2 Sidney Smith, Isaiah Ch.XL-LV in Schweich Lectures 1940, London 1944, 132: “In Dan. iv, 19 ‘Daniel whose name was Btlteshazzar’ is introduced without further use by the author, possibly because the name appeared as the original in a form of the story he was adapting.” The inference is equally valid if Nabunaid or Nabupolassar were the kings who actually bestowed the
title. 3 Altor.Forschg. 11,23 yf. and Nachtr. 57S.



828 THE BOOK OF DANIEL
In 3, story of the golden image and the fiery furnace, Daniel does
not appear and hence is not thrown into the furnace, although he is
beyond suspicion of having worshipped the image. Chaucer’s tale of
Nebuchadnezzar is remarkably at variance with the Vulgata: Daniel
with “his two” companions refuses to obey, an inevitable attempt at
emending the story.4 In 6, on the contrary, Daniel alone is in the lion’s
den. Obviously, the furnace and the den are doublets belonging to
two different popular versions, the one telling of Daniel without com
panions, the other of three companions, one of them being Daniel.
The title saknu belongs to him alone and is just as historical as his
honorific. When the two stories were amalgamated into one of Daniel
and three companions, the name of the fourth figure: Mishael, no true
Hebrew name, had to be invented, and the third honorific was split
in two. The story of the investiture as soltan or in the plur. rab-signln,
was made into one, but the doublets of the fiery furnace and the lion’s
den differed too much to unite them and were too good to omit one.
Strangely enough, in the sanctuary called NabI Daniel at Kirkuk5 only
three tombs exist, attributed to Daniel, ‘Uzair-Azariah and Hunain
Hananiah: there is no Mishael.
Dan.i, written in Hebrew, is the “vita” of the historical Nabu.
balatsu.usur, saknu of Babylon. After the conquest of Jerusalem by
Nebuchadnezzar in the third year of king Jehoiakim of Judah, he was
chosen with others to enter the corps of pages, called “somatophylakes”
in III Ezra 3,4. Thus his career began under Nebuchadnezzar and ad
vanced after the short and troubled years of the first successors during
the 17 years of Nabunaid, for whom the story substitutes his son Belsar
usur, Belshazar, regent during the king’s long absence in Taima.6 But
the real date of the conquest of Jerusalem, 597 b.c., is not the third year
of Jehoiakim who came to the throne in 607, nor is it that of Nebuchad
nezzar whose accession year was 604, and one can scarcely assume that
the original of the vita had made a mistake in so important a date. The
vita ends: “Daniel lived to see the first year of Cyrus,” i.e. 539 b.c., year
in which Cambyses, just grown up, was sar Babili, king of Babylon.
This good date contradicts the other one at the end of ch.5, the writing
4 See Pauline Aidkins, in Speculum, Jan. 1942. 5 See Arch.Reise 11,330. 8 Cf. S. Smith, l.c. chapt. 11 “History of the years 556-539.”



THE BOOK OF DANIEL 829
on the wall and Belshazar’s murder: “Darius the Mede took the king
dom [of Babylon], kebar senln sittin wetarten, when he was 62 years
of age.” The age does not fit Cyrus, the real conqueror, for, though
Dinon asserts that he was 40 at his accession, Cambyses, the eldest son
was certainly not born before, probably just after the accession in 559,
and Cyrus w'as much younger than 40 at that time, in spite of the dif
ficulty arising from the early date, 640, of his grandfather Cyrus I.
Darius—who was no Mede—came to the throne when scarcely 25 years
old. The only safe date is 539 b.c. Sixty-two years means a high age, an
age to die. A man who lived 62 years to see the conquest of Babylon
would have been born in 602/1, the third year of Nebuchadnezzar.
Through the distortion of the text one still can see the perfectly true
dates of the original vita: Daniel was born in the third year of Nebu
chadnezzar, who had conquered Jerusalem in the tenth year of Jehoia
kim; he lived to see the first year of Cyrus, and died at the age of 62.
Besides being saknu over the medlnah Babylon, he was salit talta of
the kingdom under Nabunaid (Belshazar). This was not as 6,2 says, a
new institution of Darius, but an old Babylonian one.7 The origin of
the term is the garrison on a chariot: the first officer of the king is the
one “to his right,” the second the one “to his left”; the third one, salsu
rakbu, is an adjutant. As such, Daniel was one of the three financial
inspectors of the 127 satrapies,8 as described in 6,2. Under the caliphs
the same office is called zimam, much dreaded by ministers and provin
cial governors.
All these features are historical and belong to the Neo-Babylonian
kingdom. But that, a few more titles, and the names of the kings, is
all the book has preserved of the period in which its hero actually lived.
On the contrary, all the stories of the book are rich in important detail
descriptive of conditions in Babylon under Achaemenian rule. The
locality of most of them is Babylon, but ch.8 is imagined in the “castle
of Susa on the river Ulai,” where today nothing remains but an enor
7 Of older, different interpretations I quote only Markwart's “Herrscher des dritten Teils im Reiche,” in Vtind.Jiid.u. Israel. Geschichte 66. 8 LXX has 127, as in Esther 1,1: the text has 120.

mous mound of ruins and the tomb of Daniel. 9 The locality of ch. 10-12,
which date from the time of Antiochus IV, is “on the Tigris,” i.e.
Seleucia, for there was no earlier residence on the Tigris.
In 1,5 and 8, the pages or the bodyguard live, as was the Persian
custom, “ptbg” at the court of the king, i.e. Ir. ‘pitubaga “on meat
ration,” instead of salary, Dinon’s potibazis < *paituba)is (see under
‘Harvatat’), and to avoid eating non-kosher meat, the four comrades
become vegetarian. This was regarded as amazing, and when Nebu
chadnezzar, in Dan.4,30, started “eating grass like oxen,” it was con
sidered as symptom of insanity. The motif connected with this story

that the king, when questioning them, found them to be more intel
ligent and wiser than all his astrologers and sages—lives on in the Pahl.
book of Xusrau and his page Xusarzuk.
The first word of the Aramaic text, 2,4, “malka l
e-‘alemin h eyi, o king,
live for ever!” is the address to the Iranian kings, MP. yavedan, or:
anosak ziva!; thus in the inscription Pers.B., time of Shahpuhr II, and
still in Firdausi: nosah bizi! 10 The words in Daniel can be used as
ideographic writing for the Persian words. Almost all occurring titles
are Iranian: ’hsdrpn < Med. \sa#rapavan; ’drgzr < Med. ‘andarza

6,2, and assimilation of n to d as in Hoddu < Hindu in Esth. 1,1.

perfectly clear in their specific meaning,—the last is Akk. karballate

garments, dt in 6,9 is data, the “inviolable law of the Medes and Per
sians.” The exact knowledge of these and some other details cannot
have survived the Achaemenian epoch, and the original book of which
we have only the redaction of 170 b.c. must have been composed in
Babylon under the Achaemenids.11
This date holds also for the visions in ch.7. Their Iranian character
has been recognized, but they are usually treated as one, because they

stand in the same chapter. In fact they are two separate dreams and
the details are not only Iranian but Achaemenian, and that affects their
interpretation.
The first dream begins in 7,2, “I saw in my vision by night.” 3-8:
Four great beasts come up from the sea: (1) one beast like a lion, ary eh,
with (two) wings of an eagle, standing on its feet as a man, ke ,enas;
(2) one like a bear, dob, which raised itself on one side (?) and had
three ribs (?) in its mouth between the teeth; (3) one like a leopard,
n
emar, with four wings of a fowl on his back, and with four heads;
(4) one dreadful, terrible, exceedingly strong, with great iron teeth
and ten horns.12 The lack of name and the style of its description sets
the fourth animal apart from the first three, and is an argument for
its being added to an original group of three, as has been pointed out
more than once. The interpretation, in 17, “these four great beasts are
four kings which shall come on earth” is a poor attempt of the redactor,
not of the author of the dream. Dan.% seems indeed to be composed to
replace 7,3-12. Three animals appear among the Persepolis sculptures
in the tacara of Darius, four in the Hall of a Hundred Columns of
Artaxerxes I, and there, too, the fourth may result merely from the
symmetry of the room with four doors that required four pictures. In
all cases a hero—not a king—fights the monsters which are represented
“standing like a man on their hindlegs,” and with fore-claws spread
out, Ir. prta.cinga, see iae pi. lv-lvi. The first is a simple lion, the second
a bull, the third a griffin13 with the body of a lion, hind-legs of an eagle,
neck of a horse, but feathered, two (or two pairs of) wings of an eagle,
head of a bird of prey, but with bull’s ears. The fourth is distinguished
from the third only by the horns of a bull and a scorpion’s tail.
The dream of the Assyrian prince enumerates 15 such demons. The
tenth, d sulak, can be compared with the lions of Persepolis and the
winged lion in Daniel; it is a normal lion, nesu kaimani14 “he stood
on his two hind-legs.” The eighth, etimmu (?), with the head of a
bull, but four hands and feet of man, has some similarity with the
Persepolis bulls. And with the two griffins of Persepolis the sixth and
ninth are comparable: mukil res lemutti “helper to evil,” with bird’s

head, unfolded wings, Ir. prta.prna, hands and feet of man, and the
“bad Utukku” with lion’s head, hand and feet of the bird Zu. The
authors of the original book of Daniel hardly knew Persepolis, but did
know Babylon and Susa, where similar figures in enameled tiles must
have adorned the walls, since Achaemenian art is wholly stereotyped.
Their descriptions combine what they saw with what they read.
The more important fact has scarcely ever been noted that the fol
lowing passages are also illustrated by sculptures at Persepolis, see iae
pl.lvii-lviii. Dan.7,9: “I looked on till thrones15 were set, and the Ancient
of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his
head like pure wool; his throne was like fiery flame and his wheels
as burning fire.” 10: “A thousand thousand ministered unto him and a
myriad myriads stood before him. The judgment was set, and the books
were opened.” There follows in 11-12 the very short and incomprehen
sibly mild trial of the four beasts. The first three live on for a deter
mined span of time, only the fourth is killed, its body burnt.
Nothing like a “throne on wheels” is known, and the poss.pron. “his
wheels” refers to the Ancient of days, not to the thrones (plur.). Like
Mithra’s ca^ra in Yr.10,136, the wheels are the nimbus. The ten thou
sands and myriads are not the Babylonian, but the Iranian way of
counting, Yt. 13,65: “purvis purudiazahra, purvis puru.bevano.” On the
pair of doors in the front and the back wall of the Hall of Hundred
Columns—on the four side-doors of which are the four beasts—the
picture of a royal audience unfolds itself with numberless guards and
“ministrants”—more than 160 are represented—and with the king,
Artaxerxes I, on the throne. A sitting of the court of appeal in presence
of the great king as described in Daniel, would look similar in sculp
ture. In Zoroaster’s conception the end of the world is a last judgment,
imagined like a worldly court, with written procedure: “the books were
opened.” But it was a mistake to assume that Daniel’s vision in 7,9-12
alluded to a last judgment. This is ruled out by the fact that three beasts
are allowed to live an appointed time. The vision simply describes the
sitting of a court in the Persian way, and is in no way connected with
the new act which begins in 7,13:
15 Aram, ‘d dy, like Arab, hatta, “while I was looking.” korsavan, fem.pl. abs., cf. Qur. 2,256: wasi'a kursiyyuhu.



THE BOOK OF DANIEL 833
“I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven
came one like a son of man, bar ,enas, and arrived at the Ancient of
days,16 and they brought him near before him, and there was given
him dominion, soltan, and glory, yeqar, and kingship, malku, and all
people, tribes and languages should serve him; his dominion is an ever
lasting one. . .
In 2,37 and 5,18 a similar idiom is used: “Thou, o king, art king of all
kings, for the god of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power and
glory.” Some of the words are elements of the Achaemenian protocol,
e.g. xsaya^ya dahyunam vispa.zananam (“all tribes,” Darius; Xerxes:
paru.zananam “many”), which the Akk. versions, like Daniel, render
by “matate sa naphar lisani, the lands of all tongues.” The giving of
sovereignty to the Son of man means his investiture as heir to the
throne. The way, how the Son of man is led to the presence—handeman

of the king on the throne, is the same as represented in the entrance
doors of the Hall of a Hundred Columns. The investiture itself is not
described in Daniel, but did not consist in words, but in symbolic acts,
like donning the royal attire, and perhaps ascending the throne. The
book of Enoch, composed about a hundred years after the last redaction
of Daniel, and of all apocalyptic books the one closest to Daniel says,
in 69,27: “And he sat down on the throne of his majesty,” and “that
Son of man is proclaimed17 in the presence of the Lord of spirits and
his name by the Ancient head.” Enoch, thus, understands the act exactly
as what it is : the enthronement and the proclamation of the accession of
the new king, the heir to the throne.
This act again is represented in the sculptures of Persepolis, in the
Tripylon, through which, coming from the Hall of a Hundred Col
umns, one enters the antara.arSam, the private area of the palaces.
There, the aged Darius is pictured sitting on the golden throne, in full
royal attire, and to his right—in the sculpture shifted back, so as not to
overlap the figure of the king—stands Xerxes in the same attire with
all the royal insignia, putting his hand on the back of the throne. To
sit on the throne was a crime punishable with death. The gesture is
one of familiarity, and indicates his right to the throne as designated
16 Cf. mlk ’b snm in the Alivan epic of Ugarit. 17 Cf. Cyrus Cyl. I.12: “Marduk . . . Kuras sar Aman ittabi nibitsu, proclaimed the name of Cyrus.” See the proclamation of the name al-Mutawakkil undv_r ‘Throne-names.’



THE BOOK OF DANIEL
834
heir. In Christ’s words, Mar\ 14,62, spoken before the highpriest, the
Son of man is “sitting to the right hand of power”; in Acts 7,55, mar
tyrdom of Stephan, Jesus is “standing.” The act sculptured and the act
described in Daniel are the same. It is neither the last nor any judg
ment; the trial of the beasts is over. The Son of man does not come for
a judgment, but to inherit the throne.
The term “Son of Man” in the nt. is derived from Daniel 7,13, for
where Gr. vios avOputarov is used with the most intense meaning, in
Mar\ 13,26, the eschatological prophecy, 14,26 before the highpriest,
and again in Acts 7,55 stoning of Stephen, the phrasing “coming in the
clouds of heaven” and “standing on the right of power” are quotations
from Daniel. The term comes from Aramaic, for the Greek translation,
common to Mark and Q, the source of the other Gospels, never appears
in Paul, Revelation and the Episdes, that is, in any evangelical writing
addressed to the Greek world.
The philological explanation of bar ’enas, or with article bar ,anasa, is:
the Sem. article determines regens and rectum at the same time; ,enas
“man” is coll.sg. and bar “son” signifies the individual of a genus; hence
“a son” or “the son of man” an “individual of mankind.” But ety
mology and grammar alone are incapable of revealing the special con
notation a technical term may assume at a certain time. That is a his
torical, not a philological problem. How could such a universal term
become the designation for the Messiah ?
Since part of the eschatological announcement and the words before
the high priest have been incorporated into the Christian symbol
“Ascended to heaven, sitting to the right of power, whence he shall
come to judge the living and the dead,” and since this influenced the
interpretation of the Daniel vision as last judgment, it has been assumed
that “Son of Man” peculiarly indicated the aspect of the Messiah as
judge of the worlds. But that is not the context of Dan.7,13, the passage
from which every attempt at explaining the term must start; there,
“Son of man” appears in a context where it must signify “heir to the
throne.” The act described does not belong to Palestine nor to the time
of the redaction, 170 b.c., but to Babylon under Achaemenian rule. That
is the region and the period where alone the solution of the problem
can be found. The question, how can “individual of the genus homo”
become “Messiah” was wrongly posed, and therefore unanswerable. The



THE BOOK OF DANIEL 835
question is: Did “Son of Man” have the meaning “heir” in the lan
guages spoken in Babylon during the fifth century b.c.P—and the an
swer is yes, in all of them.
The Babylonians spoke Akkadian, the Iranians Median, both spoke
Aramaic as a common language. The Jews of the captivity spoke Ara
maic, as the Daniel book shows, while Hebrew—today revived after
2,500 years—already receded into the position of a learned language.
It is the history of social institutions of that region that caused the term
“Son of Man” to assume its peculiar connotation.
The notion “man” has many sides, like man opp. animal, man opp.
woman; man in social relations or groups. In a language with more
than one word for a notion, the synonyms may be substituted for each
other, as far as their general signification overlaps. But synonymity does
not go to the whole extent, there will always be ranges of the notion
in which the use of the words differs. Where there is only one word,
this same word must cover all the various, sometimes widely different
meanings. Contemporary translations are the greatest help for determining them.
The Semitic languages usually have two words for “man”: ’dm, as
genus, opp. to animal, Germ. Mensch; and ’ns, for men in social rela
tions, Germ. Mann. This is clearest in Arabic: in the dialect of Baghdad
or Mossul for instance, a short “ban! adam!” means “it is human,”
mainly human weakness, or “they are human beings,” not animals.
But huwa min al-nas, or min aulad al-nas, “he is of good family.” “Be
have mithl al-nas!” means like decent, educated people. Likewise, in
classical Arabic, banu adam and banu 1-nas, though both mean “sons
of man” are something totally different.
With abna al-nas, e.g. Mas‘udi, mur.w111,60, designates the most noble
of all Arab families, the descendants of Hasan and H usa irt) of ‘Abbas,
the Hashimites and Quraish. To the same rank belonged the descend
ants of the orthodox caliphs and of the Umayyads until their rank at
the court was abolished in 250 h. (Tabari 111,1533). Down to the Mam
luk period some of them bear predicates in inscriptions almost equal
to those of a ruling prince.1 ' The aulad al-nas, descendants of the tribes
18 Zain al-din ‘Umar ibn al-SafTah, a “sibt,” descendant of a daughter of abu l-‘ Abbas alSaffah, founder of the ‘Abbasid caliphate, bears the exceptional predicate al-maqarr al-sharlf



THE BOOK OF DANIEL
836
that had partaken in the conquest, existed as a privileged class down
to the same period. In manuscripts of 1001 Nights the terms aulad al
nas and ahrar interchange occasionally, “sons of man” and “freemen,”
and Noldeke remarks to Tabari 1,817, where Ardashir shows the in
sulting letter of his liege-lord Ardavan to his ‘nas’: “In Persian stories
nas means exclusively the high aristocracy.” This corresponds to the
use of “nar, man” for “hvetu, nobleman” in Iranian.
This notion is rooted in the ancient Arab social structure, where only
the agnates of the tribe had a claim to full rights, and, as banu 1-nas,
were hurr “free,” asll “noble,” while the others, clients and slaves, were
nobodies, sons of nobody and did not count. The same in Akkadian,
where usurpers of the throne are called “son of nobody.” A “son of
man” is the opposite to “proletarian.” The term banu 1-laqita signifi
cantly means “foundling” and “proletarian.” Though the Arabs were
the latest of the Semitic peoples to enter history, their language and
customs are very archaic.
The synonymous use of Hebr. ben adam and ben ’enos is illustrated,
e.g. by Ps.8,5 with ,enos and ben adam, against Pr.144,3 with adam and
ben ,enos. Hebr.3,6-g translates Ps.8,5 by ri icrriv avOpa-nos and rj vio<;
avdpdiTTov. In Ezekiel, where ben adam appears several times, it is
always the word with which the Lord addresses the prophet, and ex
presses merely that God is talking to one He has created man. This is
entirely different from bar ,enas in Daniel.
In Genesis ,enos is the grandson of adam. After the story of Cain
and Abel follows the genealogical tree of the Cainites (to 4, 4), then, in
4,25-26, the birth of Seth and of his son Enos, and in 5,6-32, the gene
alogy from Enos to Noah. The Cainite genealogy is that of all wayfar
ing people; the progeny of Enos, on the contrary, are the settled tribes.
Many of the proper names in these genealogies are personifications of
tribes or classes of population. Seth, st, is the same tribal name as in
Balaam’s words in Num.2^,iy, where it stands in parallel to Moab.
Enos, son of Seth, or bene ,enos hence correspond to Arab, banu 1-nas,
noblemen. This I consider as a clear instance of the same distinction
between ’enos and adam in Hebrew as in Arabic: ’ns, not ’dm is used
al-‘alT. corresponding to “His Royal Highness” in his inscription—a decree dated Sept. 6, I44 2 >
on the wall of the Munstan Arghun at Aleppo.



THE BOOK OF DANIEL 837
where social relations are in question. And Aram, bar ,enas does not
correspond to ben adam, but at least to ben ’enos.
Aramaic, Biblical and inscriptional, seems to have—apart from ’Is

only ’enas, no plural, emph. coll. ,anasa “men”; ’dm seems to be un
known. In Daniel 2,10 “la ’Itai ,enas ‘al yabbesta, there is not a man
upon earth,” 19 it is the negation that entails the most general meaning.
But in passages like 2,23 “wherever men, bene ,enasa dwell,” or 7,8
“ ‘aine ’enasa, with human eyes,” Arabic, and I believe Hebrew, would
use ’dm. On the other hand, in Syriac, an Aramaic dialect where ’dm
is likewise missing, ’enasa has, beside the meaning “homo” and “hom
ines,” the connotation agnati, cognati, and translates e.g. in Luke 2,44
“iv rot? o~vyyevevcriv, among their kinsfolk.” Similarly, the n.abstr.
’nasuta, humanity, mankind, stands for incolae and cognati, e.g. in
Kalilag w Dimnag, an instance for the special application of the word
to social relations of men.
It does not require an explicit proof, one can simply state that bar
,enas in Dan.7,13 does not mean an anthropomorphic being as opposed
to the four beasts. Neither does it mean that a superhuman being ap
pears in human shape, like e.g. in Dan.10,6; 10,18; 8,15, where angels
assume human form. There, moreover, the notion is the same as in
Iranian, where Vrthragna appears as a “noble youth of 15,” i.e. son of
man, or Anahita as a “young girl of the noblest extraction.”
Not only in Semitic languages, but generally, the word “son” evokes
the association of “heie.” R. M. Rilke: “Du bist der Erbe. Sohne sind
die Erben, denn Vater sterben.” And the word alone can and does as
sume this connotation in all Oriental languages. In the parable Mark
12, the lord of the vineyard sends as the last his only son, and the dis
loyal husbandmen say: “This is the heir, KKj]pov6po<;, let us kill him,
and the inheritance, Kkippovopia shall be ours!”
In this case, the juridical term in Akkadian is aplu,20 while son in
general is maru, like Hebr. ben, Aram, bar; aplu:maru similar to Arab.
walad:ibn. But the term for the designated heir to the throne—not
necessarily the eldest son, mar restu—is “mar sarri, king’s son,” not apal,
19 ’ys P ’yty is the ideogr. rendering MP. kas nest, “there is nobody.” 20 CL Thureau-Dangin, RAs. x,93ff. and Arch.Orientalny 1,271: “Sum. ibila ‘heir,’” compound of ia, i “oil” and bil “to burn,” refers to ancestor-worship. “Only freemen have ancestors.”



THE BOOK OF DANIEL
838
and “mar sarri rabu, the great son-of-the-king” when compared with
others.
In OP. too, pu$ra = maru alone is the title of Xerxes as heir to the
throne, beside madista = rabu, scil. pu^ranam. In Yr.14,59 the ahura.
pu#ra and putfraho, royal princes or cadets of the high nobility, are
enumerated before the bevarpati, highest commanders of the army.
Thucydides renders the title by rraiSe? alone, Xenophon, Cyrup., speaks
of the “sons of the opoTipoC' as a class of high nobility. The mafatih,
about 370 h., p.119, explain: “al-abna’, adj. banawl, are the sons of the
dahaqln, noblemen.”21 Analogies are Amharic lij < walad = prince
royal, and walad as title of the heir presumptive in Umayyad Spain;
“infante” became the title of the heir apparent under Juan I. When
used in intense meaning, Aram, bar is “heir, successor.”
Both elements of bar ,enas have beside their general a more intense
meaning which together gives “heir of a privileged class,” or “of the
royal house,” not “individual of genus homo.” It was so already at the
Old Babylonian period.
The Code Hammurapi, written in the 18th century b.c., but codify
ing much older institutions, distinguishes three social classes: (1) awe
lum, (2) muskenum, (3) wardum, the free (or noble), the half-free,
and the slaves, awelum means “man”; it may even mean “prisoner of
war”; with negation “nobody.” The abstr.noun awelutu is coll, “hu
manity, mankind”; this has a syn. tenisetu corresponding to Aram,
’nasuta from ’ns, with the special meaning “inhabitants.” But juridi
cally and socially awelum, or as individual mar awelim “son of man,”
is the free man of the highest class. The term for the second class, mus
kenum, Arab, maskin, Fr. mesquin, is once explained by “those who
have nothing,” opposed to the man of property whose son inherits.
During the Kassite period, as Landsberger recognized, 1935 in aof
x,i42, n.i, the word “banu, good, best,” intens. babbanu, replaced this
awelum as social term; it was also used in addressing men of rank.
In the Neo-Babylonian and Achaemenian periods the same three
classes were called (1) mar.banutu, full-freedom, (2) arad.sarrutu,
king’s bondage, i.e. half-freedom, (3) qallutu, slavery. Thus mar-banu
= Gr. aristos, took the place of mar-awelim “son of man,” as Akk.
equivalent of the contemporary Aram, bar ,enas. For explaining this
21 Cf. dehlkan under ‘Social Structure.’



THE BOOK OF DANIEL 839
term, in Babylonia under Achaemenian rule, it is not Hebr. ben adam,
but Akk. mar-awelim, later replaced by mar-banu which we must
compare.
The corresponding Iranian terms are Aw. viso.pu#ra, and Med. azata,
OP. aSata. No Iranian could misunderstand these words: the first is
“son, heir of a vis,” the other zata “born,” azata “born into (a clan),”
agnate, hence “noble.” Engl, “highborn,” Germ, hochgeboren, are pred
icates; Ir. azata is itself the name of the class, cf. Aw. kuda.zata, lit.
“where-born,” of whatever rank.
In distinction from Semitic custom, the Iranian nobility, azata, was
differentiated already in the sixth century, perhaps as result of the
monarchic constitution, into several degrees. The vaisapu#ra—see
under ‘Kavi’—were the highest. In the parchments from Elephantine,
Rsama, an Achaemenid, is called bar beta (sg.), in the contemporary
papyrus, Sachau 1,3, the plural bene beta “sons of the house,” means
potential successors of the king, br byt’ is the ideogram for MP. vas
puhr. The simple bar ,enas would not do for so specific an Iranian term;
hence “beta, house” enters for Ir. “vis, house, clan,” as in the Arab, term
ahl al-buyutat, whereas singularic ahl al-bait in Arabic means the
descendants of Muhammad. The address to the Sasanian heir to the
throne is “pus vaspuhr sahan farra^vtum, son, vaspuhr, most blessed
of kings!”
The Babylonian scribes use mar-banu for two things in their trans
lations of the OP. inscriptions: (1) in Beh. §§ 13, 43 etc. “mare banuti
sa ittisu, the mar-banu with him” for “fratama martiya anusya, the
noblest men, his adherents”—anusya is derivative of the prep, anu
with”; (2) in the introduction of the Behistun inscription, which
deals with the events that led to Darius’ accession, the king says in §§ 3E:
haca prvyata adata ahmahi, word by word Lat. “ex priori agnati sumus,
from the beginning were we agnates” (entitled to succession) “eight
of my family were kings, I am the ninth, in two lines we were kings.”
The Akk. version renders the quoted words by “[ultu] abu[tu mare]
banuti anini, since (the time of) our ancestors were we mare banuti.”
The usual translation is “. . we were noble.” This noncommittal trans
lation tries to avoid being entirely wrong, but the wider the range of
the word used for translating, the more wrong conceptions it includes.



THE BOOK OF DANIEL
84O
The whole passage is not said in order to convey to a remote democratic
posterity the commonplace that the royal clan belonged to a privileged
class of that old society. It seeks to substantiate the king’s claim that
after the extinction of the older line, in spite of the irregularity of his
succession—while his father and grandfather were still alive—he was
the legitimate heir.
mar-banu, that is the equivalent of old mar awelim and of contem
porary Aram, bar ,enas, “son of man,” stands here for OP. aSata, Lat.
agnatus.
This translation was made in 520 b.c., a time when the Babylonian
scribes, many of them Aramaeans, had a perfect knowledge of the lan
guages in question. The translation could be so entirely right only
because the social institutions were essentially the same. But such terms
lose their meaning when translated into the language of a society with
different structure. Tfos av8pd>Trov is a linguistically correct translation,
but conveys nothing of the social and historical contents of the term bar
,enas.
As designation for the young man whom the Ancient of days invests
in Dan.'], 13 with the majesty, bar ,enas means the same as mar-banu =
adata in Beh. §3, where Darius uses it to justify his claim to the suc
cession. It does not mean “individual of mankind,” son of nobody, but
“youth of noble extraction,” “successor, heir to the throne.” It is a
synonym of the two other terms for the Messiah, “Son of God” and
“Son of David.”



XLVII. ZOROASTER’S DEATH
The Awesta contains no allusion to Zoroaster’s death.
Occidental legends which go back to the pseudo-Clementine Recogni
tiones, second century a.d., describe him as astrologer, some identify
him with the Assyrian Nimrod, and make him be slain by lightning.
These stories scarcely pretend to be history.
Another late line of tradition makes him a king of Bactria whom
Ninus, personification of Assyria, kills in battle. This line claims to
come from Hellanicus, Ctesias and Dinon, none of whom can be the
source: the name Zoroaster has been inserted into a legend of different
kind. Ctesias wrote Oxyartes, i.e. OP. uxsya.rta, Aw. u^syat-rta, which
allows one to think of Zoroastrian eschatology as wrongly interpreted.
The source of Firdausi’s broad presentation of Zoroaster’s death is the
Sasanian xvatayna.ma\. There, Zoroaster was implicated in the legend
of the war of the Tura Arjasp against Gustasp—see under ‘Notarya’
and was killed, together with Gustasp’s father Luhrasp in the temple
of Balkh, when Tura warriors conquered it. “I know not who slew
this priest” says Firdausi. The locality is Bactria, as in the occidental
group; but that is far from being a historical confirmation. An old
myth of Druvaspa-Arvataspa took possession of the historical figure of
"V istaspa—rejuvenating itself thereby—and Vistaspa, the protector, drew
Zoroaster, the protege, with him. The locality of the myth was not
changed but remained that of the god Druvaspa: Bactria.
A fourth version to which also the Gr.Bdh. and the eschatological
Rahman Yasht allude, is found in Den\.5 and Ddtistan e Deni\ 72.
Den\.5 is based on a work of ASarfarrabag i FarrmyzaSan, from ASar
baijan, primate, pesopay, of the Zoroastrian community in Iran under
the caliphate of al-Ma’mun. The third book of the Denkart ascribes to
him an entire redaction of the Awesta of Tansar. The material must
have received that form when ASarfarrabag held his famous disputa
tion in presence of the caliph in a.d. 825. The Datistan is a work of
Manucihr, grand-mobaS of Fars and Kirman in the second half of the
ninth century a.d. ASarfarrabag wrote while the interest of the Islamic
mutazila in such things lasted, and before the strict orthodoxy, inau
gurated by Mutawakkil, turned away from them. The political situa
tion caused the tendency to construe a connection between the Iranian



ZOROASTER S DEATH
842
past and the Old Testament. The epitome preserved in Den \. 5 speaks
of “the suzerainty of the (Iranian) ancestors over the spahpat Bo^tnar
seh; the diplomatic mission which the dahyupat, sovereign KaiLuh
rasp of Balkh in Eransahr sent with Boxtnarseh (co-sender or himself
envoy?) to Hrom (Byzantium) and to beta maqdis.” The last name is
not Aramaic but Arabic bait al-maqdis, Jerusalem.
The same fabricated history is not much later reproduced with much
detail by Tabari, 1,645!!.: Luhrasp resided in Balkh; Bu^tnasar, whose
Persian name was b^trsh, was his ispahbaS over Ahwaz as far as Rum,
all the country west of the Tigris. When he adds “Buxtnasar was the
son of Nabuzaradan” (nabu.zer.iddin) or “Awilmarudakh (Awel
Marduk) was his son,” this knowledge comes from a Syriac translation
of Berossus’ king lists. Bahman—the personification of the second half
of the name Daraya-Vahumanah, the first being Dara—deposed Bu^t
nasar’s son blt’sr, 1
i.e. Belshazar, because “khalata fi amrihi”—just as
Nabunaid says of his predecessor Labasi.Marduk, son of Nergal.sar.
usur—“he did not know how to rule,” and invested Darayavus al-Madh
awi, who killed Belshazar, but was equally dispossessed by Bahman
three years later. Bahman, then, instituted Kurus, under whom Daniel
appeared.
The book of Daniel is the source of this construction, blt’sr is Bel.sar.
usur, son of Nabunaid; but in Dan.5,11 the queen says to Belshazar
“your father Nebuchadnezzar.” Darayavus the Mede, whose identity
with the Iranian Dara Tabari fails to see, comes from Dan.5,30: “Bel
shazar was murdered, Darius the Mede took the kingdom.” Kirus =
Koras is Dan.6,29: “Daniel became powerful in the kingdom of Darius
the Mede, and also of Cyrus the Persian,” the last remark an after
thought of the redactor with regard to Dan. 1,21: “he lived to see the
first year of Cyrus.”
The name Boxtnarseh of the Denkart is Nebuchadnezzar; however,
not Akk. nabu.kudur.usur, but the Aram, form of the Daniel book,
n
ebok‘adnessar has been assimilated, in the first half to Ir. boxt “re
deemed,” in the second to the frequent name Narseh. It was also as
similated to Xusrau, thus in Mah Fran. §14 bvxt-xvslvb'; Sahr.Er. §50
bxt.xvs lv'. Vid.20,1 quotes proverbial sayings: “invulnerable like Span
1 Cf. Josephus, Antiqit. x,23i : Bo \rdirapos = Nabunaid. The name blt’sr must not be emended, perhaps with Aram, t for Akk. s.



Zoroaster’s death 843
dyat [an Achill], wise like Kayus [a Solomon]; autocratic like JamseS
[a Tsar of all Russias], rich like p^tsrvb' [a Croesus], courageous like
Krsasp [a Siegfried], and pesdat like Hosang” [perhaps a Solon], The
Denfyart says similarly: “Hosyang for pesdadih, Dahak for vicoyistarih
(magic), pxtslvb' for bahrawandih (wealth).” Tabari’s b^trsh presup
poses the same ambiguous ending as in the similar name bl’tvlys, soon
to be discussed. Starting from Aram. neb6kt!adnessar, all these forms
must have passed through *bo^;tnasar, preserved in Arab, buxtnasar.
In this version of ASarfarrabag, in the Den\., Zoroaster—called “the
best of men” in allusion to ‘All khairu 1-nas—is murdered by a Tura,
non-Aryan, non-Zoroastrian priest and sorcerer, whose name is trans
mitted in a dozen ambiguous spellings.3 Our evaluation of the tradi
tion depends wholly on the explanation and provenance of that name.
It begins always with bl’t-, and the endings lie between -vlvlys and -lys,
where v may be n, 1 = r, and y+s also s-fih or other ligatures.
In another context the name appears only once more, and at an older
time, Sahr.Er. §57, a work composed at the very end of the fifth cen
tury a.d.:
sahristan e Nun Nun e yvl’s’n kirt u pa zanih 6 kaikavat mat u
drupustih e arvandasp tur e bl’tvlvs e karp pa yatukih kirt pahrakih e
jan e xves ray, the town Nun was built by Nun son of Yu . . .
,
it came
by marriage to Kaikavat; into a stronghold of Arvandasp it was made
by the Tura bl’tvlvs, the sacrificial priest, by magic, for the protection
of his life.”
§24, composed in analogy, says: “The town Bawer (Babel) was built
under the reign of Yam (Jamsed),” then some astrological measures.
The counterpart to Babylon is Nineveh; Nun is Nineveh, its founder is
Nun. A slight emendation would give Nun e Yoshu‘an, Nun son of
Yoshua instead of Yoshua son of Nun. Tabari 1,506 calls Yusha‘b. Nun
the successor of Moses; however, he is nowhere connected with Nine
veh, and his maqam is venerated at Ma‘arrat al-Nu‘man in Syria. On
the other hand, an equally easy emendation gives yunahan, and the
sanctuary of the prophet Jonah stands on the temple mound of Niniveh.
Jonah is the dhu 1-nun—vulgar Arab, abu 1-nun—properly “man with
the fish,” interpreted as “father of Nun,” hence Nun e Yunahan,

ZOROASTER S DEATH

founder of Nineveh-Nun. Whatever it is, figures of the Old Testament
are received into the Iranian legend, as in the Denkart stories.
Such a figure is also the astrologer-magician bl’tvlvs. Jackson and
Markwart tried an Iranian interpretation, with bl’t- = brat “brother”;
but it is Akk. balatu “life”; the name is blts’sr, honorific of Daniel. In
analogy to the king’s name n6bokh adnessar, the ending is assimilated
to Ir. Narseh; the variant which Markwart preferred, reading the whole
bratores, can also be read balat.narseh. He is called Tura as an (a)#ura,
Babylonian.
Arvandasp, in Sahr.Er. §57, is the name of the father of Bevarasp
Azdaha. AziDahaka, whose places are Babylon and Kurinta, is the
enemy of Yama and ©retona, and personifies in the Iranian legend the
Neo-Babylonian empire, or the historical figures of Nebuchadnezzar
and Nabonaid. His father Arvandasp represents the late Assyrian em
pire, as does Sardanapal in Greek stories. KaiKavat is the legendary
founder of the Median dynasty, called after the fire of this dynasty,
the aSar kavatakan in Agbatana. The Medes conquered Nineveh-Nun
in 612 b.c. The change of the dynasty is perpetuated as a marriage, like
the conquest of Babylon as a marriage of ©retona’s three sons and three
daughters of Nebuchadnezzar. Thus Daniel shifts from Babylon to
Nineveh. As “chief of the sorcerers” (Dan.2,46) he builds “by magic”
the fortress which had been so difficult to conquer.
ASarfarrabag knew the prose version of the xvataynamak, which ibn
al-Muqaffa‘ had at that time already translated into Arabic, and he
knew the Sahr.Eran and perhaps other books lost to us. Mas‘udi,
murud-j v,i28 e.g. relates that Daniel the younger was believed to have
been the maternal uncle of Cyrus. Such amazing concepts are not anti
semitism, but on the contrary attempts to make the stories more accept
able to the mu'tazilite Muhammedans. In the xvataynama\, Tura kill
the prophet, but no name was called: “I know not who killed this
priest.” The name therefore is a combination of ASarfarrabag. The per
secution by kavi and karpan, developed from Y.32, is the leitmotiv of
the legendary vita of Zoroaster, and the Sahr.Er. call Balatnarseh a
karpan. 3 There is no grain of historical truth in these tales.
3 Markwart interpreted his reading bratores < *bratrvya.vraisa as “who wounds his brother’s
son.” No language has formed a special word for the murder of a person in that degree of relationship. On the same basis one could construe “fratricida.” If ASarfarrabag had construed a



Zoroaster’s death 845
Finally there is one more version of Zoroaster’s death in De/2^.7,5,1
and 6,1 (from the Nikez e Vehden) and in the Citakiha, the “Selected
Pieces” of Zatsparm, a brother of Manucihr, who wrote about a.d. 880
“The passing away, vryez, of Zoroaster took place in the year 47 of
the religion [i.e. the era], at an age of 77 years and 40 days.” The num
ber, which has a mystic air as all multiples of 11, expresses a very high
age. An inquiry into its mystical or historical character leads back to
our first chapter ‘Chronology,’ since it contains the secondary’ distinc
tion between birth and appearance, in the prophet’s 31st year. If counted
from 569 as date of the birth, the date of his death would be 492 b.c.
Den\.j,6,i adds to viy^ez “passing away into paradise.” The verb is
used in the Parinirvana hymn to Mani, Mir.Man.111,20 d no: “It is time
that you [Mani, no years after his death] ‘draw up’ the faithful, kv
rd vyft v^ynfh.” The verb means rather an ascension to heaven, cer
tainly no murder. The murder of Zoroaster is entirely unhistorical. It is
mentioned for the first time 1,400 years after the prophet’s death, and
in a legendary form. If Zoroaster had been murdered, the fact would,
from the beginning, resound loudly and persistently in history. I be
lieve that his tomb still exists today, untouched and untouchable.
meaning of that kind, it might have been a help for his combination only when assuming, moreover, that the legendary vita of Zoroaster contained a similar word.






ADDENDUM






ADDENDUM
The following additions to the text should be made
:
Page 103, 2nd line from bottom, add after “Kavat”
:
This poorly preserved passage must be compared with the Kavat
legend in Gr.Bdh. 231:
apurnay andar keput but There was a baby in a basket
u.s - - an pa rot be hist abandoned by his [parents]
on a river,
pa vatakan be apaspart drifting at the mercy of the
wind
Uzav be dit stat be parvart Uzaw saw it, took it, raised it,
frazand xvant kavat nam nihat adopted it, called it Kavat.
keput is ki/Swtos, quppatu; 1.3 recalls the name of the famous
“wind-borne treasure, vat-awurt” of Xusrau I, but one feels
tempted to read “pa [ka] vatakan apaspart,” with +kavataka
“foundling.”
Page 290, Note 2a to read:
In Ves u Ramin—see Minorsky, bsoas 1946, xi.4 p. 22—oaths are
taken to the “pure souls of the good and the ancestors” and
“before the temple fire.” Tabari 1x1,1791 f: the caliph al-Muhtadi
declares: “I do not take an oath unless it be in the presence of the
ban! Hashim [his clan]” etc.
Page 302, add note to “is the judgment,” 12th line from bottom:
In Heraclitus frgm.63, Diels, Vorso\ratiker, the idea of the end
of the world in fire appears combined with resurrection and last
judgment, notions which have no foundation in Greek thought
and must come from Iran.
Page 392, add to Note 13:
In Judaism, the first traces of the idea of resurrection appear
in the vision of Ezefoj and in the dark eschatology of Is.26,
12-17: They differ from the later belief, foreign to Judaism, by
being a judgment over nations, not every single man according
to his faults and merits. This thought does not appear before the
last chapter of Daniel, prophecy referring to Antiochus Epiph
anes, 164 b.c., hence is clearly of Zoroastrian origin.



850 ADDENDUM
Page 447, add after “preserved,” line 1
:
In Yt. 19,74 Husravali is called “owner of the well-ordered, un
shakable, uninfringeable command, sanhu,” clearly expressing
the power of the sovereign whose “data” are “not to be violated,”
noit awidro^Sa in 17.10,17 or di-la ta‘de’ in Esther.
Page 447, add to Note 11:
To Hertel, the original myth is that of a rainbringer who
opens with his shot the windows of heaven. Another interpreta
tion makes the shot mark the utmost limits of conquest, an
equally old motif which occurs in Germanic myth as Thor’s
hammer, and which would fit a Median version of the time
of their immigration which led the Medes as far west as the
Hvanvant pass. That cannot be called “unexpected”—see Mi
norsky bsoas 1946, x,4 p. 20. The Arsacid period, during which
the old epic received its chivalresque character, may have pro
duced other interpretations and localizations.

usta ahmai yahmai usta kahmaicit

to assume that the whole constellation was ever called Satavesa,

Page 632, add note to “tin and lead,” line 19:
I have been told that Landsberger restricts the signification of
anaku in the Old Ass. tablets from Kanes, 19th cent, b.c., to “tin.”
Page 736, substitute after “of Israel” for lines 13-19:

imposed by much later Kurdish immigrants upon the aborigines.
Page 780, add after “1500 b.c.,” line 8:
In Asia Minor iron was used since the period of Sargon of
Akkad, more than a thousand years earlier, as proved by the iron
dagger with gold handle and iron and gold necklaces discovered
in the tombs of Alaja Oyiik.
