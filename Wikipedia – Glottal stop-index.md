Glottal stop
The glottal stop is a type of consonantal sound used in many
spoken languages, produced by obstructing airflow in the vocal tract
or, more precisely, the glottis. The symbol in the International
Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is ⟨ʔ⟩. Using IPA, this
sound is known as a glottal plosive.
As a result of the obstruction of the airflow in the glottis, the glottal
vibration either stops or becomes irregular with a low rate and
sudden drop in intensity.[1]
Features
Features of the glottal stop:[citation needed]
Its manner of articulation is occlusive, which means it is
produced by obstructing airflow in the vocal tract. Since the
consonant is also oral, with no nasal outlet, the airflow is
blocked entirely, and the consonant is a stop.
Its phonation is voiceless, which means it is produced without
vibration of the vocal cords; necessarily so, because the vocal
cords are held tightly together, preventing vibration.
It is an oral consonant, which means air is allowed to escape
through the mouth only.
Because the sound is not produced with airflow over the
tongue, the central–lateral dichotomy does not apply.
The airstream mechanism is pulmonic, which means it is
articulated by pushing air solely with the lungs and diaphragm,
as in most sounds.
Writing



See also: Glottal stop (letter)
In the traditional Romanization of many languages, such as Arabic,
the glottal stop is transcribed with an apostrophe, ⟨ʼ⟩, which is the
source of the IPA character ⟨ʔ⟩. In many Polynesian languages that
use the Latin alphabet, however, the glottal stop is written with a
reversed apostrophe, ⟨ʻ⟩ (called ‘okina in Hawaiian and Samoan),
which is used to transcribe the Arabic ayin as well and is the source
of the IPA character for the voiced pharyngeal fricative ⟨ʕ⟩. In Malay
the glottal stop is represented by the letter ⟨k⟩, in Võro and Maltese
by ⟨q⟩.
Other scripts also have letters used for representing the glottal stop,
such as the Hebrew letter aleph ⟨א⟩ and the Cyrillic letter palochka
⟨Ӏ⟩, used in several Caucasian languages. In Tundra Nenets, it is
represented by the letters apostrophe ⟨ʼ⟩ and double apostrophe
⟨ˮ⟩. In Japanese, glottal stops occur at the end of interjections of
surprise or anger and are represented by the character ⟨っ⟩.
In the graphic representation of most Philippine languages, the
glottal stop has no consistent symbolization. In most cases, however,
a word that begins with a vowel-letter (Tagalog aso, "dog") is always
pronounced with an unrepresented glottal stop before that vowel (as
in Modern German and Hausa). Some orthographies use a hyphen
instead of the reverse apostrophe if the glottal stop occurs in the
middle of the word (Tagalog pag-ibig, "love"; or Visayan gabi-i,
"night"). If it occurs in the end of a Tagalog word, the last vowel is
written with a circumflex accent (known as the pakupyâ) if both a
stress and a glottal stop occur in the final vowel (basâ, "wet") or a
grave accent (known as the paiwà) if the glottal stop occurs at the
final vowel, but the stress occurs at the penultimate syllable (batà,
"child").
[2][3][4]



Some Canadian indigenous languages have adopted the phonetic
symbol ʔ itself as part of their orthographies. In some of them, it
occurs as a pair of uppercase and lowercase characters, Ɂ and ɂ.[5]
The numeral 7 is sometimes substituted for ʔ and is preferred in
some languages such as Squamish.
In 2015, two women in the Northwest Territories challenged the
territorial government over its refusal to permit them to use the ʔ
character in their daughters' names: Sahaiʔa, a Chipewyan name,
and Sakaeʔah, a Slavey name (the two names are actually cognates).
The territory argued that territorial and federal identity documents
were unable to accommodate the character. The women registered
the names with hyphens instead of the ʔ, while continuing to
challenge the policy.[6]
Use of the glottal stop is a distinct characteristic of the Southern
Mainland Argyll dialects of Scottish Gaelic. In such a dialect, the
standard Gaelic phrase Tha Gàidhlig agam ("I speak Gaelic"), would
be rendered Tha Gàidhlig a'am.[citation needed]
Occurrence
In English, the (phonemic) glottal stop occurs as an open juncture
(for example, between the vowel sounds in uh-oh!,[7]) and
allophonically in T-glottalization. In British English, the glottal stop is
most familiar in the Cockney pronunciation of "butter" as "bu'er".
Additionally, there is the glottal stop as a null onset for English, in
other words, it is the non-phonemic glottal stop occurring before
isolated or initial vowels (for example, representing uh-oh!, [ˈʌʔoʊ]
and [ˈʔʌʔoʊ] are phonemically identical to /ˈʌ.oʊ/).
Often a glottal stop happens at the beginning of vowel phonation
after a silence. [1]



Although this segment is not a written
[8]
phoneme in English, it
occurs phonetically in nearly all dialects of English, as an allophone
of /t/ in the syllable coda. Speakers of Cockney, Scottish English and
several other British dialects also pronounce an intervocalic /t/
between vowels as in city. In Received Pronunciation, a glottal stop is
inserted before a tautosyllabic voiceless stop: stoʼp, thaʼt, knoʼck,
waʼtch, also leaʼp, soaʼk, helʼp, pinʼch.
[9]
In many languages that do not allow a sequence of vowels, such as
Persian, the glottal stop may be used to break up such a hiatus.
There are intricate interactions between falling tone and the glottal
stop in the histories of such languages as Danish (see stød), Chinese
and Thai.
[citation needed]
In many languages, the unstressed intervocalic allophone of the
glottal stop is a creaky-voiced glottal approximant. It is known to be
contrastive in only one language, Gimi, in which it is the voiced
equivalent of the stop.
[citation needed]
The table below demonstrates how widely the sound of glottal stop
is found among the world's spoken languages. It is not intended to
be a complete list. Any of these languages may have varieties not
represented in the table.
