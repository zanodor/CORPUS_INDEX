A Brief Guide to the Babylonian Constellations
Posted on October 25, 2011
The following notes describe the essential meanings of the 50 or so
mainstream constellations found in the Babylonian tradition. For more
information on these and other less well-known stars and
constellations the reader is referred to ‘Babylonian Star-lore, An
Illustrated Guide to the Star-lore and Constellations of Ancient
Babylonia’ by Gavin White.
Anunitum (Northern fish of Pisces) Anunitum was the patron goddess
of the city of Akkad. She was closely affiliated to Inanna-Ishtar, who as
the ‘Syrian Goddess’ was envisioned holding her sacred fish and dove.
As a seasonal symbol the fish of Anunitum represents the spring floods
when river carp swim upstream in swollen rivers to their spawning
grounds. As a mythic symbol the fish guides the sun on its ascending
path from the darkness of winter towards the spring.
Arrow (Sirius & probably other adjacent stars in Canis Major) Although
closely associated with the constellation of the Bow, the Arrow is
always treated separately in Babylonian tradition. The annual rising of
the Arrow marked the summer solstice when the sun was at its
maximum height above the horizon. The Arrow was probably chosen
for this role as it is the man-made object that can reach highest into
the heavens. Similarly, the bird on a high perch, which is often seen
besides the Arrow in ancient artwork, can also be thought of as
representing the sun at its highest station.
Bow (Puppis – the poop deck of the Argo) The Bow depicts Inanna
Ishtar in her aspect of war goddess and granter of victory. Her star
rises in high summer, when campaigns started in the spring come to
their natural fruition. Mythical texts often describe the goddess in



gory detail in the midst of battle.
Bull of Heaven (Taurus) The Bull of Heaven symbolizes the fecund
powers of the spring-time skies – rain and sunshine – which bring life
and growth to the earth. The Bull also represents the Golden Calf of
biblical fame, which symbolizes the new-born sun emerging from the
cosmic waters of creation just as the new-born calf emerges from the
waters of the womb.
Cargo-Boat (Pisces Australis) The mythic function of the Cargo-Boat is
probably to transport the souls of new-born children from the
ancestral realms towards the realms of living. The ‘Cargo’ refers to
various objects carried in the boat that symbolize the sex of the child
boys are represented by throwing sticks and axes, girls by spindles,
hair-clasps and needles.
Crab (Cancer) The Crab symbolizes the summer-time drought. Like
the adjacent Serpent it was thought to withhold the waters of heaven
thus preventing any rain from falling during the hot summer months.
Crook (Auriga) The Crook depicts a shepherd tending a goat-kid. It
naturally symbolizes the spring-time when the majority of calves,
lambs and kids are born in the cattle-folds. The shepherd also
symbolizes the king, who figuratively guides his people on the paths
of safety and security. The Crook therefore appropriately rises in the
first month of the year when the king was enthroned and empowered
to rule for another year.
Eagle & Dead Man (Aquila & Sagitta) The Dead Man, carried by the
Eagle, represents the souls of the dead traveling into the afterlife. Ir
rises just before the winter solstice which is the time when the earth
bound dead were thought to journey to the realm of the ancestors.
Eridu (Vela – the sails of Argo) The Star of Eridu rises in the autumn
months when the summer-time drought is broken by the arrival of the
rainy season. Her overflowing vases, a common symbol of fertility in
artwork, represents the returning rains and the rising water levels in
the rivers and canals.



Field (The Square of Pegasus) The Field represents a barley field
divided by a series of irrigation ditches. The constellation rises as the
barley is regularly irrigated and starts to ripen. In astrology its omens
naturally foretell the nature of the coming harvest.
Fish (Pisces Austrinus) Like Anunitum, the Fish symbolizes the season
of flooding, which commences in the early spring. Like other creatures
of the Abyss, fish were thought to be symbols of wisdom and were
accordingly held sacred to Enki, the god of creative intelligence,
incantations and magic.
Frond (Coma Berenices & western part of Virgo) The Frond is
represented in the heavens by the figure of the goddess Erua holding
her sacred branch of the Date-palm. Her constellation rises in the
autumn months as the dates are ripening on the fronds.
Furrow (Eastern half of Virgo) The Furrow is obviously the origin of
our modern Virgo with her familiar ear of barley. The constellation
rises in the autumn when the fields have been prepared and are ready
to be sown with the coming season’s barley seed.
Goatfish (Capricorn) The Goatfish rises after the winter solstice, when
it announces the welcome return of the sun. I believe that the Goatfish
is one of the relatively new constellation figures and can be best
understood in terms of two older constellations – the Stag which
announces the returning sun, and the Fish which guides the sun
through the darkness of winter.
Great One (Aquarius) The Great One with his overflowing vases
symbolizes the rains of heaven and the swollen rivers that
characterize late winter and early spring. In the context of the star
map he can also be regarded as the ‘Irrigator’ who waters the barley
fields that are represented on the star-map by the adjacent
constellation known as the Field.
Great Twins (Gemini) The Great Twins are closely related to Nergal,
the king of the dead in Mesopotamia tradition. The Twins stand
guard, weapons at the ready, at the entrance to the underworld – their



divine role being to prevent the living from descending to the realm of
the dead, and perhaps more importantly to prevent the dead from
rising up to overwhelm the realm of the living.
Harrow(Vela – the sails of the Argo) The Harrow is another seasonal
star closely associated with the Furrow. Harrows were used to break
down the large clods of earth produced by ploughing; they are used in
the early autumn just before the fields are seeded.
Hired Man (Aries) The Hired Man is the Babylonian name for the
familiar ram of Aries. The name is really a literate pun, which overtly
refers to the hired labour employed in the spring to bring in the barley
harvest, but with a little literary license the name can also be
understood as something like ‘the sheep of atonement’. It rightly
symbolizes the spring-time when the harvest is brought in and the
lambs are born in the cattle-folds.
Horse (Front legs of Pegasus & Lacerta) In many ancient cultures the
horse is allocated the divine duty of pulling the chariot of the sun.
There seem to be two principle reasons underpinning this solar
association – one is his great speed, and the other is that his flowing
mane was thought to be a fitting symbol of the rays of light emanating
from the sun.
Lion (Leo) The Lion has two main strands of symbolism. Firstly as a
seasonal star it represents the ferocious heat of summer – its radiant
mane stands for the overbearing radiance of the summer sun.
Secondly, as the sacred beast of the war goddess Inanna-Ishtar, the
Lion represents victory and war. The bright star at its breast (our
Regulus) is known as the King Star – here representing the favourite of
the goddess to whom she grants victory.
Little Twins (Canis Minor) The Little Twins no doubt share the same
symbolism as their larger counterparts – the Great Twins. In astrology
both sets of Twins are were thought to predict war and the outbreak
of hostilities.
Lulal & Latarak (Cetus & part of Eridanus) The Lion-headed figures



known as Lulal and Latarak are probably best regarded as protective
deities who have been set at the juncture of the old and new years.
Their divine role would therefore be to banish the influences of the
past year and to purify the coming calendrical cycle.
Mad Dog (Lupus) The Mad Dog is probably a relic of an ancient star
configuration which included the now derelict Bison-man. Together
they constituted a version of the ‘Lion-bull’ conflict, which is widely
thought to symbolise the seasonal conflict between summer and
autumn. Here the bull, who represents the autumn rains slays the lion
of summer.
Ninmah (Vela – the sails of Argo) The mother goddess is represented
among the stars by Ninmah – the ‘Exalted Lady’. Her star rises in late
summer just after the great ancestral festival celebrated in month 5.
Just as the winter stars depict the souls of the dead traveling to the
underworld, here in late summer new souls destined for birth journey
from the ancestral worlds towards the realm of men.
Old Man (Perseus) The Old Man rises in the final month of the year
and is appropriately associated with Enmesharra – an ancestral god
who resides in the underworld in the form of a ghost.
Pabilsag (Sagittarius) Pabilsag is the direct forerunner to the centaur
archer that we know today as Sagittarius. His name can be translated
as the ‘Chief Ancestor’ or ‘Forefather’, and he can be best compared to
the Wild Hunter of western folklore who guides the souls of the dead
to the afterlife over the course of the winter months.
Panther (Cygnus & part of Cepheus) Like Pabilsag, the Eagle and Dead
Man, which all rise at the time of the winter solstice, the Panther is
closely associated with the realm of the dead and the afterlife. It is the
sacred beast of Nergal, the Babylonian lord of the dead, and it has
probably been set among the winter-time stars to guard the entrance
to the underworld. A memory of the Panther may well live on in the
guise of Cerberus, the three-headed hound that guarded the entrance
to the Greek underworld.



Plough (Most of Draco) For the 8 months of the year that the seed
plough was not in use it was suspended from a peg and hung from the
rafters of a barn. This farming tradition seems to inform the location
and symbolism of the Plough-constellation. The celestial Plough is
located in the circumpolar regions – ie the ‘heights of heaven’ that
correspond to the barn’s rafters. Like its terrestrial counterpart the
celestial Plough is also suspended from a peg, which here represents
the pole of the ecliptic – the eternal centre point of the heavens.
Rainbow (M31 Galaxy in Andromeda) The Rainbow is considered a
sign of good fortune bringing rain and abundance to the land. It rises
in early spring when the rains water the ripening crops.
Raven (Corvus) The Raven is sacred to Adad, the god of rain and
storm. Appropriately enough the Raven rises as the summer dry
season comes to an end and the storm clouds of autumn start to
gather.
Rooster (Lepus) The Rooster is the animal symbol belonging to the
herald of the godswho appears in his human form in the adjacent
figure known as the True Shepherd of Anu. The Rooster was probably
assigned the role of herald to the gods as it announced the coming of
dawn each day.
Scales (Libra) The Scales are held sacred to the god Shamash, who
was not only the sun god of ancient Mesopotamia but was also the
god of truth and justice. His scales symbolised the principle of justice
as in the judge ‘weighing up’ the evidence before issuing a
commensurate verdict and a fair sentence. The sun god’s all-seeing
eye made him the infalliable witness to all deeds and as such men
called upon him as the upholder of righteousness and petitioned him
to rectify the inequities they suffered.
Scorpion (Scorpio) In astrology the Scorpion’s armoured body
segments and its array of weaponry predisposed it to become a
creature symbolizing war and the martial prowess of the king.
However a different meaning is attached to it in mythic texts such as



the Gilgamesh Epic where Scorpion-men and women guard the sacred
mountain through which the hero has traverse on his quest for
immortality. The Scorpion-people are said to guard the sun at his
rising and setting and because Gilgamesh is a favourite of the sun god
they allow him to travel the subterranean path that the sun travels
every night under the mountain.
Serpent (Hydra) In many cultures the world over the snake is
regarded as one of the primary symbols of death and the underworld.
In Babylonian lore, the constellation of the Serpent is held sacred to
the god Ningishzida, who is a major god of the underworld. He is
generally portrayed with a pair of horned serpents arising from his
shoulders. In astrology the Serpent is thought to bring plague and
pestilence to the land.
She-Goat (Lyra) In astrology the omens of the She-Goat foretell the
fate of cattle. However for unknown reasons the constellation is not
represented by a goat but by the figure of an enthroned goddess
known as Gula. She is the patron of healing and medicine and as a
benevolent goddess she naturally has the power to restore the health
and life of men. But she also has a darker side as she also has the
power to inflict disease and death to man and beast alike.
Sitting Dog (Most of Hercules) The Sitting Dog is the sacred animal of
Gula (the regent of the She-Goat). It reflects the darker side of the
goddess as it is widely considered to be a harbinger of death and
disease. The underlying meaning of the dog is revealed in many
cultures where it is simply known as the ‘eater of corpses’ – a rather
grisly symbol of all-devouring death. For this reason the dog or wolf is
often stationed at the entrance to the underworld in world mythology.
Sitting Gods (Most of Ophiuchus) The serpent-bodied men known as
the Sitting and Standing Gods represent the ancestors of Enlil, the
ultimate leader of the whole Babylonian pantheon. They dwell in the
Sacred Mound, which is at once a burial mound and an image of the
primeval earth. As such the serpent-bodied gods represent the dual



powers of the earth as an abode of the dead and as the source of all
earthly fertility.
Stag (Cassiopeia & part of Andromeda) In world mythology the stag is
frequently associated with the sun and the rekindling of fire
sometimes it is even portrayed pulling the chariot of the sun instead of
the more familiar horse. The constellation of the Stag rises just after
mid-winter and is no doubt stationed in this region of the heavens to
symbolize the rebirth of the sun after its winter-time death.
Standing Gods (Corona Borealis) See the section on the Sitting Gods
above.
Star Cluster (Pleiades) The 7 principle stars of the Star Cluster
represent seven war-mongering demons found in the entourage of
Erra – the ferocious and unpredictable god of war, wild-fire and
plague. They are typically portrayed carrying bows, axes and daggers,
and in astrology their presence portends the death and destruction
brought by war.
Shupa (Bootes) Shupa probably represents the high god Enlil, who is
considered to be the leader of the Babylonian pantheon. As a mark of
his exalted status he holds the symbol known as the ‘rod and ring’. He
is closely associated with the ‘Ropes of Heaven’, which figuratively
bind together the various levels of the cosmos and regulate the
temporal movement of the heavens.
Swallow (Head & neck of Pegasus plus the western fish of Pisces) The
Swallow or ‘Exalted bird’ may be identified with the dove that appears
in Greek myths surrounding the Syrian goddess. Her characteristic
myth recounts how a dove brooded an enormous egg that two fish
found floating in the Euphrates, and that the Syrian goddess herself
was born from this egg.
Swine (Probably Delphinus) The Swine is sacred to Damu, ‘the Child’.
His cult is closely related to tat of Dumuzi who died every summer
and was subsequently reborn every winter. Myths relate how Damu
escaped from the underworld via a river and it is thus appropriate that



his sacred constellation should rise just after mid-winter.
True Shepherd of Anu (Orion) The True Shepherd represents the
herald of the gods, variously called Papshukkal or Ninshubur. Small
statues of him were sometimes deposited in a brick box beneath the
main cult statue in a temple as if to relay messages between the gods
and mankind.
Wagon (The 7 principle stars of Ursa Major) In astrology the Wagon is
said to portend eclipses, which are thought to cause the violent death
of the king. Various other references in Babylonian literature
effectively identify the Wagon as a funeral bier carrying the corpse to
the burial ground. Such a meaning has evidently been transmitted to
Arabian star-lore where these same stars are envisioned as a group of
mourners pulling a funeral bier.
Wagon of Heaven (Ursa Minor) See the description of the Wagon
above.
Wild Boar (Most of Centaurus) The Wild Boar is sacred to Ningirsu, a
local form of Ninurta, who is a god closely associated with farming.
Indeed the boar’s habit of churning up the earth as it forages for food
may ultimately be the historical inspiration for the invention of the
plough, which allowed early societies to adopt a sedentary lifestyle.
Wolf (Head & middle of Draco) The Wolf gnaws at the harness-work
that suspends the Plough to the centre of heaven. When it finally tears
the rope asunder, the different levels of the cosmos that the rope
unites will collapse bringing about the end of a world-era.
Zababa (Eastern part of Ophiuchus) Zababa was a little known war
god sometimes called the ‘king of battles’. He was associated with the
city of Kish in northern Babylonia, which produced four dynsties of
overlords in the ages immediately after the Great Flood.
