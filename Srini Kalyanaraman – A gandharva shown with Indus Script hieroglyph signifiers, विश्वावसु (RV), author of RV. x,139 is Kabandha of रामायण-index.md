In Rgveda akhyana, विश्वा --िसु or Danu 'gandharva' (RV), is author of RV. x,139. He is later
called Danu Kabandha an आथिवण and गन्धिव S3Br. xiv.
दनुः danuḥ N. of a monster, son of Śrī, cursed by Indra and killed by Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa. He
had a headless trunk, and hence called िनुकबन्ध . -Comp. -जुः -पत्रुः , -संभवुः , -सूनुः a demon; Bhāg.6.9.40.
" विश्वा --िसु 'gandharva' gets the name कबन्ध , Kabandha, lit. "headless torso", because he
is राक्षस िनु (son of श्री ; punished by इन्द्र for insolently challenging him to combat ; his head and thighs were forced into his body by a blow from the god's thunderbolt , leaving him with long arms and a huge mouth in his belly ; it was predicted that he would not recover his original shape until his arms were cut off by राम and लक्ष्मण ).

the Ramayana describes him as one-eyed. (Painting on ceiling of temple in Ayodhyapattinam near Salem, probably 16th-century.) Kabandha's legend appears in the Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata, as well as in later Ramayana adaptations. Upon his death, Kabandha resumes his gandharva form and directs Rama to the Rishyamukha mountain, where the exiled monkey-chief Sugriva is hiding. Kabandha advises Rama to form an alliance with Sugriva, who would be of assistance in the search for Rama's wife Sita, who had been kidnapped by Ravana, the demon-king of Lanka. Following Kabandha's instructions, Rama befriends Sugriva and rescues Sita with his help."
Kabandha was born as a Gandharva – a celestial musician (right) here pictured with an Apsara, celestial dancer. (10th-century Cham "Dancers' Pedestal" of the Tra Kieu style.) "On the ordinary level, the eight great charnel grounds (Skt. aṣṭamahāśmāśāna; Tib.
དུར་ཁྲོད་ཆེན་པྲོ་བརྒྱད་ , durtrö chenpo gyé, Wyl. dur khrod chen po brgyad) are the burial sites around a
city to accommodate the rituals of the different Indian castes. From the spiritual point of view, they are the places where the dismembered parts of Rudra's body came to rest, after they were scattered from the top of Mount Malaya. The energy centres of his body—the head, heart, naval, and genitals—fell in the four cardinal directions; his four limbs fell in the four intermediate directions. From these parts, eight great trees arose, and around these trees developed the eight great charnel grounds." https://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Eight_great_charnel_grounds

A gandharva is depicted as a guardian in Bauddham tradition as evidenced on stone stupa monuments in Korea of 8th century. He wears a khola 'lion-skin cap' to signify in Indus Script Cipher his status as kola 'tiger' rebus: kol 'working in iron' kolhe 'smelter'. As an orthographic

determintative, a feline paw extending from the cap juts into the chest of the gandharva: panja 'feline paw' rebus: panja 'kiln, furnace'.
The same gandharva is shown in another sculpture with a wild animal skin cap and other Indus Script attributes which identify him as an iron, copper smelter.

The guardian king belongs to one of the eight catagories of Buddhist beings: that of the heavenly musicians (gandharva). One can identify this statue as such because of its wild beast headdress. Technically perfect, this bronze Korean statue is unique today. The inscription on the base dates it to the "Rooster Year," without specifying the reference era. Comparing it to paintings featuring the same style and theme found in the Turfan Oasis of China's Xinjiang Province, experts can date it to the end of Unified Silla (668-918 CE) or the 9th century CE.

Facade Stones with Eight Divine Beings of Stone Stupa (Gandharva) unknownUnified Silla, 8th century
The Eight Divine Beings, originally native gods in India, were appropriated as the eight guardians of Buddhist sutras when Buddhism was founded. In Korea, they frequently appeared as engravings on stone stupas, monuments, and lamps from the 8th century onwards.

Asura and Gandharva , engraved onto the upper-level base stone of a stone stupa, were discovered at the Damamsa Temple site. Gandharva is sheathed in armor, wearing a lion crown, and also sits on a cloud. Both images, carved in great detail with the utmost dexterity and elaborate technique, are estimated to be from the Unified Silla Period in the 8th century. Details

Aṣṭadikpālaka (अष्टविक्पालक ) or Aṣṭadikpāla refers to the “eight guardians of the directions”, as defined according to texts dealing with śilpa (arts and crafs), known as śilpaśāstras.—The hand poses for the eight dikpālas (guardians of directions) are described in the Abhinayadarpaṇa and they are followed in the dance performance. But the hastas prescribed to depict the
[Aṣṭadikpālaka] Gods in Abhinayadarpaṇa do not exactly look like the images of Gods found in the temples.
Indra is represented with two kartarīmukha-hastas holding the vajra in the left hand and a flower in the right hand. Agni is found with four hands where the upper hands hold a torch in kartarīmukha hastas and the lower hands hold a porringer in kuvi-patāka-hasta. Yama is found holding a club in his left hand near the left shoulder and in the right hand holding the rope of the buffalo on which he rides. Nirti is found with the right hand holding the club and the left hand hanging loose. Varuna is found holding pāśa in both his hands in kaṭaka or siṃha-karnahasta. The figure of Vāyu chiseled is found in kartarīmukha-hasta.Yakṣapatī (Kubera) is found with a sword in the right hand and a shield in the left hand. Īśāna is found with a trident and a drum in the right and the left hands respectively. Source: Google Books: Genealogy of the South Indian Deities

1. Indra is the above-mentioned king gods. He is also known as Devendra.
2. Agni is the element fire, more precisely the gods of fire, also known as Agnibhagavān. 3. Yama is the god of death and king of hell or the lowest world that is known as Pātālaloka and Yamaloka. 4. Nirṛti is the element earth and is portrayed in the form of a giant. 5. Vāyu is the element air, more precisely the god of air. 6. Varuṇa is the god of clouds and rain. 7. Kubera is the god of riches. 8. Īśāna is Īśvara himself.

After Buddhism was officially recognized in 527, the fourteenth year of King Beopheung’s
reign, the Buddhist faith spread rapidly throughout Silla society, from the king to his subjects. Such rapid dissemination led to the construction of numerous temples throughout Gyeongju.
Worship of Chakra
The scene represents worship of the wheel, which was one of the symbols of the Buddha before the introduction of his anthropomorphic image. The wheel stands for the Buddha’s first sermon delivered in the deer park at Sarnath, suggested here by the presence of the two addorsed deer on the shaft, when he set the wheel of the law in motion. Of the two flanking couples, the eminence of the couple on the proper right is suggested by the male carrying a garland and the female kneeling down to make an offering.



14
The Vessantara Jataka
The coping stone fragment briefly tells the story of the Vessantara jataka. According to legend the Bodhisattva, born as prince Vessantara was very much given to charity. Taking advantage of his philanthropic nature the king of Kalinga, which was suffering from drought, sent some Brahmanas to beg for his favourite elephant, as the elephant was supposed to have the power of bringing rain. The prayer was duly granted and Vessantara made a gift of his elephant. In the panel the Bodhisattva is seen as having descended from his elephant and offering it to a Brahmana after pouring water into his hands from a vessel with due ceremony.



15
Worship of Bodhi tree representing Krakuchchhanda Buddha
The half medallion on a rail pillar fragment features the symbolic representation of one of the seven mortal Buddhas, Krakuchchhanda. It represents a throne under a tree (thesirisha) being worshipped by devotees. The inscription reads: bhagavato kakusadhasa bodhi (i.e. the bodhi tree of Lord Krakuchchhanda). The dedicatory inscription on the shaft states that this is a gift from the donors from Purika (purikaya dakana danam). Each of these seven Tathagatas, known also as samyak-sambuddhas, viz. Vipasyi, Visvabhu, Sikhi, Krakuchhanda, Kanakamuni, Kasyapa and Sakyamuni have their own bodhivriksha (sacred tree), the one of Krakuchhanda being Sirisa (Accacia Sirissa) .



16
Growth of Buddhism
The Buddha emphasized that one should seek deliverance through one’s own efforts throughout his lifetime. He asked his disciples to accept the dharma as their guide and themselves as their own refuge. The great mass of people, however, came to regard him more as a divine being than a human teacher and considered his compassion or karuna as the saviour. The faith in compassion or karuna, led to the cult of worshipping the Buddha. In the beginning, his relics were taken as objects of worship. Gradually the image of the Buddha occupied the central place in Buddhist worship and eventually led to the construction of a large number of stupas and icons of votive offerings of the pilgrims – a tangible expression of devotion.

Birth of Siddhartha
Queen Maya standing with slight flexion of the body is shown as holding the branch of a sala tree. The child Buddha appears to be issuing from her waist section. The bejewelled lady is accompanied by three headed Brahma, the creator of the universe and four-armed Vishnu, the preserver. A small figure of the Buddha is shown standing on five lotuses to the right side of the lady symbolizing the seven steps after his birth. As legends say, the Buddha, taking seven steps declared, “I am born for enlightenment of the good of the world; this is my last birth in the world of phenomena”. Indra, the lord of the heaven, who received the child after birth, is seen on the right side with a cloth in his hands. A female attendant is seen on the left.Two devotees are seated on the pedestal. The Life of Buddha
Siddhartha better known as Gautama, the Buddha, was also called Sakyasimha, the Lion of the Sakyas’ and Sakyamuni, ‘the Sage of the Sakyas’ as he was born in the Kshatriya clan of the Sakyas, of which his father Suddhodana was the chief. The latter’s capital was Kapilavastu



19
(variously identified with Piprawah, District Basti and Talaurakot, District Taulihawa, Nepalese Terai). Before his birth, his mother Mahamaya or Maya had a dream in which she dreamt of a white elephant entering her womb. On the eve of her confinement, Mayadevi proceeded to her native place, evahrada, but on her way she delivered a son in the grove of Lumbini (Rummindei, District Bhairhwa, Nepalese Terai).Tradition has it that the child was delivered by the deity Indra along with Brahma. There is no agreement about the date of his birth, the generally accepted date being 566 and 563 B.C.E.
Maya’s Dream
According to Buddhist texts, before the birth of the Buddha, his mother, Maya Devi had a dream in which she saw a white elephant entering her womb. In sculptures, this theme is presented by a lady asleep on a couch with an elephant hovering over her. This panel, depicts the bed chamber of Queen Maya Devi flanked by vaulted corridors, and supported on Persepolitan pillars without shafts. The queen is asleep on a furnished couch, her head raised on a high pillow. From a circular slab the Bodhisattva descending in the form of an elephant is seen.

This snuffers, used to cut lamp wicks, were found in Wolji. They were originally made of gilt-bronze, although little of the original plated metal has survived. The handles of the snuffers were made in the curved shape of vines, and the front side is also decorated with elaborate vine incisions. What’s more, every bit of open space is dappled with bead
designs. Along the blades of the snuffers, there are hemispheric rims to catch the cut wick; when the snuffers are closed, the rims create a full circle. This metalwork bears a very stylish and intricate design, conjuring up the lavish lifestyle of the palace during the Unified Silla Period. Details

The Divine Bell of King Seongdeok, which was crafted in 771 CE, during the reign of King Hyegong, is also known as the Bell of Bongdeoksa Temple. This masterpiece served as a model for Buddhist bells in the Unified Silla Period, and demonstrates how advanced the metal craftingtechnology of that time really was. On top of the bell, two dragon-shaped ornaments create a ring from which the bell was hung, and behind the neck of each dragon ornament is a reverberation pipe. Both the top and bottom edges of the bell feature beautiful engravings of peony vines, while similar designs adorn the borders of the four rectangular panels on the upper part of the bell, surrounding nine lotus flower designs. Below these panels, two “apsaras” (Buddhist nymphs) sit facing one another, each gripping an incense burner with handle. Between the apsaras, approximately 1,000 characters explain the reason for making the bell and list the names of the people who participated in the process.

Garuda Unified Silla 9th century
The Garuda was excavated from the site of Cheongwansa Temple connected to the love story of Kim Yusin (595~673) and Cheongwannyeo. Also known as Geumsijo(Bird with Gold Wings), Garuda is a fanciful bird that appears in ancient Indian myths and is said to eat dragons. In Buddhist art, Garudas are characteristically expressed with bird’s beaks. This Garuda appears to be descending from heaven with a flowing celestial robe, sitting on a cloud and dressed in armor with the body slightly twisted. Such a posture is imbued with liveliness and naturalness. Details

Vaikuntha Chaturmurti or Vaikuntha Vishnu is a four-headed aspect of the Hindu
god Vishnu, mostly found in Kashmir (northern part of the Indian subcontinent). The icon represents Vishnu as the Supreme Being. He has a human head, a lion head, a boar head and a demonic head. Sometimes, even three-headed aspects of Vishnu where the demonic rear head is dropped are considered to represent Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. Though iconographical treatises



31
describe him to eight-armed, he is often depicted with four. Generally, Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is shown standing but sometimes he is depicted seated on his vahana (mount) Garuda.
The concept of a four-headed Vishnu first appears in the Hindu epic Mahabharata, but the complete iconography was first found in a 5th-century Pancharatra text. The icon reflects influences from the Gupta period and the Gandhara architectural tradition. While as per one interpretation, the animal heads represent Vishnu's avatar Narasimha (lion-headed man) and Varaha (boar), another theory based on Pancharatra texts relates the four heads to the Chaturvyuha: Vāsudeva (Krishna), Saṃkarṣaṇa (Balarama), Pradyumna and Aniruddha four vyuhas (manifestations) of Vishnu. A cult centered on Vaikuntha Chaturmurti developed in Kashmir in the 8–12th century, when the deity also enjoyed royal patronage in the region. The Lakshmana Temple of Khajuraho suggests his worship in the Chandela kingdom (Central India) in the 10th century.
