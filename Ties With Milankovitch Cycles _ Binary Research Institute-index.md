The Milankovitch Cycles are the results of studying past global climate changes over millions of years. One of the c
climate change is precession of the equinoxes, which seems to have a period of 22,000 to 23,000 years, over m
years.
But according to the current accepted model of precession, the main source of precession is due to luni-solar fo

1975, Simon Newcomb’s formula for precession below was used to calculate the yearly increase in precession.

Note the table, below using Newcomb’s annual increase, 100,000 years ago, precession would have been ar

Milankovitch cycles describe the collective effects of changes in the Earth's
movements on its climate over thousands of years. The term is named after Serbian
geophysicist and astronomer Milutin Milanković. In the 1920s, he theorized that
variations in eccentricity, axial tilt, and precession of the Earth's orbit resulted in
cyclical variation in the solar radiation reaching the Earth, and that this orbital forcing
strongly influenced climatic patterns on Earth.



Similar astronomical theories had been advanced in the 19th century by Joseph
Adhemar, James Croll and others, but verification was difficult because there was no
reliably dated evidence, and because it was unclear which periods were important.
Now, materials on Earth that have been unchanged for millennia are being studied to
indicate the history of Earth's climate. Though they are consistent with the
Milankovitch hypothesis, there are still several observations that the hypothesis does
not explain.
The Earth's rotation around its axis, and revolution around the Sun, evolve over time
due to gravitational interactions with other bodies in the solar system. The variations
are complex, but a few cycles are dominant.[2]
The Earth's orbit varies between nearly circular and mildly elliptical (its eccentricity
varies). When the orbit is more elongated, there is more variation in the distance
between the Earth and the Sun, and in the amount of solar radiation, at different times
in the year. In addition, the rotational tilt of the Earth (its obliquity) changes slightly. A
greater tilt makes the seasons more extreme. Finally, the direction in the fixed stars
pointed to by the Earth's axis changes (axial precession), while the Earth's elliptical
orbit around the Sun rotates (apsidal precession). The combined effect is that proximity
to the Sun occurs during different astronomical seasons.
Milankovitch studied changes in these movements of the Earth, which alter the amount
and location of solar radiation reaching the Earth. This is known as solar forcing (an
example of radiative forcing). Milankovitch emphasized the changes experienced at
65° north due to the great amount of land at that latitude. Land masses change
temperature more quickly than oceans, because of the mixing of surface and deep
water and the fact that soil has a lower volumetric heat capacity than water.
Orbital shape (eccentricity)
Main article: Orbital eccentricity
Earth's movements



Circular orbit, no eccentricity Orbit with 0.5 eccentricity; Earth's orbit is never this eccentric
The Earth's orbit approximates an ellipse. Eccentricity measures the departure of this
ellipse from circularity. The shape of the Earth's orbit varies between nearly circular
(with the lowest eccentricity of 0.000055) and mildly elliptical (highest eccentricity of
0.0679)[3] Its geometric or logarithmic mean is 0.0019. The major component of these
variations occurs with a period of 413,000 years (eccentricity variation of ±0.012).
Other components have 95,000-year and 125,000-year cycles (with a beat period of
400,000 years). They loosely combine into a 100,000-year cycle (variation of −0.03 to
+0.02). The present eccentricity is 0.017 and decreasing.
Eccentricity varies primarily due to the gravitational pull of Jupiter and Saturn.
However, the semi-major axis of the orbital ellipse remains unchanged; according to
perturbation theory, which computes the evolution of the orbit, the semi-major axis is
invariant. The orbital period (the length of a sidereal year) is also invariant, because
according to Kepler's third law, it is determined by the semi-major axis.
Effect on temperature
The semi-major axis is a constant. Therefore, when Earth's orbit becomes more
eccentric, the semi-minor axis shortens. This increases the magnitude of seasonal
changes.[4]
The relative increase in solar irradiation at closest approach to the Sun (perihelion)
compared to the irradiation at the furthest distance (aphelion) is slightly larger than four
times the eccentricity. For Earth's current orbital eccentricity, incoming solar radiation
varies by about 6.8%, while the distance from the Sun currently varies by only 3.4%
(5.1 million km). Perihelion presently occurs around January 3, while aphelion is around



July 4. When the orbit is at its most eccentric, the amount of solar radiation at
perihelion will be about 23% more than at aphelion. However, the Earth's eccentricity
is always so small that the variation in solar irradiation is a minor factor in seasonal
climate variation, compared to axial tilt and even compared to the relative ease of
heating the larger land masses of the northern hemisphere.

The seasons are quadrants of the Earth's orbit, marked by the two solstices and the
two equinoxes. Kepler's second law states that a body in orbit traces equal areas over
equal times; its orbital velocity is highest around perihelion and lowest around
aphelion. The Earth spends less time near perihelion and more time near aphelion. This
means that the lengths of the seasons vary.
Perihelion currently occurs around January 3, so the Earth's greater velocity shortens
winter and autumn in the northern hemisphere. Summer in the northern hemisphere is
4.66 days longer than winter, and spring is 2.9 days longer than autumn.
Greater eccentricity increases the variation in the Earth's orbital velocity. However,
currently, the Earth's orbit is becoming less eccentric (more nearly circular). This will



make the seasons more similar in length.
Axial tilt (obliquity)
Main article: Axial tilt
22.1–24.5° range of Earth's obliquity
The angle of the Earth's axial tilt with respect to the orbital plane (the obliquity of the
ecliptic) varies between 22.1° and 24.5°, over a cycle of about 41,000 years. The
current tilt is 23.44°, roughly halfway between its extreme values. The tilt last reached
its maximum in 8,700 BCE. It is now in the decreasing phase of its cycle, and will reach
its minimum around the year 11,800 CE.
Increased tilt increases the amplitude of the seasonal cycle in insolation, providing
more solar radiation in each hemisphere's summer and less in winter. However, these
effects are not uniform everywhere on the Earth's surface. Increased tilt increases the
total annual solar radiation at higher latitudes, and decreases the total closer to the
equator.
The current trend of decreasing tilt, by itself, will promote milder seasons (warmer
winters and colder summers), as well as an overall cooling trend. Because most of the
planet's snow and ice lies at high latitude, decreasing tilt may encourage the onset of
an ice age for two reasons: There is less overall summer insolation, and also less
insolation at higher latitudes, which melts less of the previous winter's snow and ice.
Axial precession
Main article: Axial precession



Precessional movement
Axial precession is the trend in the direction of the Earth's axis of rotation relative to
the fixed stars, with a period of 25,771.5 years. This motion means that eventually
Polaris will no longer be the north pole star. It is caused by the tidal forces exerted by
the Sun and the Moon on the solid Earth; both contribute roughly equally to this effect.
Currently, perihelion occurs during the southern hemisphere's summer. This means
that solar radiation due to (1) axial tilt aiming the southern hemisphere toward the Sun
and (2) the Earth's proximity to the Sun, both reach maximum during the summer and
both reach minimum during the winter. Their effects on heating are additive, which
means that seasonal variation in irradiation of the southern hemisphere is more
extreme. In the northern hemisphere, these two factors reach maximum at opposite
times of the year: The north is tilted toward the Sun when the Earth is furthest from the
Sun. The two forces work in opposite directions, resulting in less extreme variation.
In about 13,000 years, the north pole will be tilted toward the Sun when the Earth is at
perihelion. Axial tilt and orbital eccentricity will both contribute their maximum increase
in solar radiation during the northern hemisphere's summer. Axial precession will
promote more extreme variation in irradiation of the northern hemisphere and less
extreme variation in the south.
When the Earth's axis is aligned such that aphelion and perihelion occur near the
equinoxes, axial tilt will not be aligned with or against eccentricity.
Apsidal precession



Main article: Apsidal precession
Planets orbiting the Sun follow elliptical (oval) orbits that rotate gradually over time (apsidal precession). The eccentricity of this ellipse is exaggerated for visualization. Most orbits in the Solar System have a much smaller eccentricity, making them nearly circular.
In addition, the orbital ellipse itself precesses in space, in an irregular fashion,
completing a full cycle every 112,000 years relative to the fixed stars.[6] Apsidal
precession occurs in the plane of the ecliptic and alters the orientation of the Earth's
orbit relative to the ecliptic. This happens primarily as a result of interactions with
Jupiter and Saturn. Smaller contributions are also made by the sun's oblateness and
by the effects of general relativity that are well known for Mercury.
Apsidal precession combines with the 25,771.5-year cycle of axial precession (see
above) to vary the position in the year that the Earth reaches perihelion. Apsidal
precession shortens this period to 23,000 years on average (varying between 20,800
and 29,000 years).[6]



Effects of precession on the seasons (using the Northern Hemisphere terms).
As the orientation of Earth's orbit changes, each season will gradually start earlier in
the year. Precession means the Earth's nonuniform motion (see above) will affect
different seasons. Winter, for instance, will be in a different section of the orbit. When
the Earth's apsides are aligned with the equinoxes, the length of spring and summer
combined will equal that of autumn and winter. When they are aligned with the
solstices, the difference in the length of these seasons will be greatest.
Orbital inclination
Main article: Orbital inclination
The inclination of Earth's orbit drifts up and down relative to its present orbit. This
three-dimensional movement is known as "precession of the ecliptic" or "planetary
precession". Earth's current inclination is 1.57°.
Milankovitch did not study apsidal precession. It was discovered more recently and
measured, relative to Earth's orbit, to have a period of about 70,000 years.
However, when measured independently of Earth's orbit, but relative to the invariable
plane (the plane that represents the angular momentum of the Solar System,
approximately the orbital plane of Jupiter), precession has a period of about 100,000



years. This period is very similar to the 100,000-year eccentricity period. Both periods
closely match the 100,000-year pattern of glacial events.[7]
The nature of sediments can vary in a cyclic fashion, and these cycles can be displayed in the sedimentary record. Here, cycles can be observed in the colouration and resistance of different strata.
Artifacts taken from the Earth have been studied to infer the cycles of past climate. A
study of the chronology of Antarctic ice cores using oxygen-nitrogen ratios in air
bubbles trapped in the ice, which appear to respond directly to the local insolation,
concluded that the climatic response documented in the ice cores was driven by
northern hemisphere insolation as proposed by the Milankovitch hypothesis.[8] Analysis
of deep-ocean cores and a seminal paper by Hays, Imbrie, and Shackleton[9] provide
additional validation of the Milankovitch hypothesis through physical artifacts.
These studies fit so well with the orbital periods that they support Milankovitch's
hypothesis that variations in the Earth's orbit influence climate. However, the fit is not
perfect, and problems remain reconciling theory with observations.
100,000-year problem
Main article: 100,000-year problem
Of all the orbital cycles, Milankovitch believed that obliquity had the greatest effect on
climate, and that it did so by varying the summer insolation in northern high latitudes.
Therefore, he deduced a 41,000-year period for ice ages.[10][11] However, subsequent
Problems



research[12][13][14] has shown that ice age cycles of the Quaternary glaciation over the
last million years have been at a 100,000-year period, which matches the eccentricity
cycle.
Various explanations for this discrepancy have been proposed, including frequency
modulation[15] or various feedbacks (from carbon dioxide, cosmic rays, or from ice
sheet dynamics). Some models can reproduce the 100,000-year cycles as a result of
non-linear interactions between small changes in the Earth's orbit and internal
oscillations of the climate system.[16][17]
Jung-Eun Lee of Brown University proposes that precession changes the amount of
energy that Earth absorbs, because the southern hemisphere's greater ability to grow
sea ice reflects more energy away from Earth. Moreover, Lee says, "Precession only
matters when eccentricity is large. That's why we see a stronger 100,000-year pace
than a 21,000-year pace."[18][19]
Some have argued that the length of the climate record is insufficient to establish a
statistically significant relationship between climate and eccentricity variations.[20]
Transition problem
Variations of cycle times, curves determined from ocean sediments
In fact, from 1–3 million years ago, climate cycles did match the 41,000-year cycle in
obliquity. After 1 million years ago, this switched to the 100,000-year cycle matching
eccentricity. The transition problem refers to the need to explain what changed 1
million years ago.[21]
Unsplit peak problem
Even the well-dated climate records of the last million years do not exactly match the



shape of the eccentricity curve. Eccentricity has component cycles of 95,000 and
125,000 years. However, some researchers say the records do not show these peaks,
but only show a single cycle of 100,000 years.[22]
Stage 5 problem
Deep-sea core samples show that the interglacial interval known as marine isotope
stage 5 began 130,000 years ago. This is 10,000 years before the solar forcing that the
Milankovitch hypothesis predicts. (This is also known as the causality problem,
because the effect precedes the putative cause.)
Effect exceeds cause
See also: Climate change feedback
420,000 years of ice core data from Vostok, Antarctica research station
Artifacts show that the variation in Earth's climate is much more extreme than the
variation in the intensity of solar radiation calculated as the Earth's orbit evolves. If
orbital forcing causes climate change, science needs to explain why the observed
effect is amplified compared to the theoretical effect.
Some climate systems exhibit amplification (positive feedback) and damping
responses (negative feedback). An example of amplification would be if, with the land
masses around 65° north covered in year-round ice, solar energy were reflected away.
Amplification would mean that an ice age induces changes that impede orbital forcing
from ending the ice age.
The Earth's current orbital inclination is 1.57° (see above). Earth presently moves
through the invariable plane around January 9 and July 9. At these times, there is an



increase in meteors and noctilucent clouds. If this is because there is a disk of dust
and debris in the invariable plane, then when the Earth's orbital inclination is near 0°
and it is orbiting through this dust, materials could be accreted into the atmosphere.
This process could explain the narrowness of the 100,000-year climate cycle.[23][24]

Since orbital variations are predictable,[25] any model that relates orbital variations to
climate can be run forward to predict future climate.
An often-cited 1980 orbital model by Imbrie and Imbrie predicted "that the long-term
cooling trend that began some 6,000 years ago will continue for the next 23,000
years".[26] More recent work suggests that orbital variations should gradually increase
65° N summer insolation over the next 25,000 years.[27] Earth's orbit will become less
eccentric for about the next 100,000 years, so changes in this insolation will be
dominated by changes in obliquity, and should not decline enough to cause an ice age
in the next 50,000 years.[28][29]
However, the mechanism by which orbital forcing influences climate is not well
understood nor definitive:
1. Earth is not homogeneous. Milankovitch did not relate Earth's ice ages to the total
amount of solar radiation (insolation) reaching Earth but to the insolation striking 65° N
in summer, due to the relative ease of heating the larger land masses of the northern
hemisphere. Later studies have suggested that insolation hitting ice would simply be
reflected away.
2. Earth is not inert. Geology affects climate, not just from the heat of the Earth's core,
Present and future conditions



but from changes to the atmosphere caused by volcanic eruptions.[24] Even the
configuration of land masses and ice masses changes over time due to continental
drift.
3. The flourishing and industrial activity of humankind may affect climate (may
contribute anthropogenic effects) in ways not predicted by orbital models. Many
studies have concluded that detectable increases in greenhouse gas in the 20th and
21st centuries would trap energy and result in a warmer climate.[30][31][32] A previous
theory was that industrial particulate pollution of the atmosphere would block solar
radiation and result in cooling.
4. The article Future of earth presents a variety of infrequent events, such as collisions
of bodies within the solar system and encounters with bodies outside the solar system,
with the potential to make past or future climate deviate from a mathematical model of
orbital forcing.
Other bodies in the Solar System undergo geological effects associated with orbital
fluctuations like the Milankovitch cycles, though not as intense or complex as the
Earth's cycles. These cycles cause the movement of elements in the solid state:
Mars
Mars has no moon large enough to stabilize its obliquity, which has varied from 10 to
70 degrees. This would explain recent observations of its surface compared to
evidence of different conditions in its past, such as the extent of its polar caps.[33][34]
Saturn
Saturn's moon Titan has a cycle of approximately 60,000 years that changes the
location of the methane lakes.[35][36]
Neptune
Neptune's moon Triton has a similar variation to Titan with respect to migration of solid
nitrogen deposits over long time scales.[37]
Effects beyond Earth



Exoplanets
Scientists using computer models to study extreme axial tilts have concluded that high
obliquity would cause climate extremes that would threaten Earth-like life. They noted
that high obliquity would not likely sterilize a planet completely, but would make it
harder for warm-blooded, land-based life to thrive.[38] Although the obliquity they
studied is more extreme than Earth ever experiences, there are scenarios 1.5 to 4.5
billion years from now, as the Moon's stabilizing effect lessens, where obliquity could
leave its current range and the poles could eventually point almost directly at the
Sun.[39]
