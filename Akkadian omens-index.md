Akkadian omens
Mixed matings
EUGENE M. MCCARTHY, PHD GENETICS, ΦΒΚ
Stele of Narâm-Sîn, king of Akkad, celebrating his victory against the Lullubi from Zagros (c. 2250 B.C.).
Centered on the city of Akkad, the Akkadian Empire, which existed in
the third millennium B.C., was the first Semitic-speaking empire of
the Tigris-Euphrates Valley.
The Akkadians believed in omens, that is, in the idea that present
day occurrences can foretell future events. For this reason, they
compiled lists indicating the expected future consequence for each
different kind of event. Among those omens were cases in which
animals were observed choosing mates not of their own kind. Their
listings of such cases are interesting not only because they show
that the Akkadians knew animals do in fact make such choices, but



also because they provide information about the specific
combinations of which the Akkadians were aware. Many of these
combinations have been forgotten in modern, urban-oriented
culture.
The following is a collection of omens and consequences taken from
Sally M. Freedman's interesting book If A City Is Set On A Height:
The Akkadian Omen Series Šumma Alu ina Mele Šakin (vol. 3, The
University of Pennsylvania Museum, 2017). These omens are quoted
from ancient clay tablets, which are often broken or for other
reasons illegible. So bracketed words and letters indicate portions of
the omen text completed on the basis of other existing texts. Ellipses
indicate missing text that could not be surmised.

In addition, Freedman (2017, p. 33) states that one tablet "preserves



three wild animal omens in a context of sexual activity among
different kinds of animals," which indicates that the Akkadians, who
lived more than 4,000 years ago, were aware that hybridization
occurs in the wild—something many people are no longer aware of
today.
