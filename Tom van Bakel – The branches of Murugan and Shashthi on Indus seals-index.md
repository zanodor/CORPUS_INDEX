# Index for Tom van Bakel – The branches of Murugan and Shashthi on Indus seals.pdf

M-1186 A
This is one of the most fascinating seals from the Ancient Indus Valley Civilization: in the centre the god Murugan kneels and prays to the moon goddess Shashthi, and the river goddess Valli, here depicted as a sphinx, walks behind him. Beneath them there are the seven Krittika, the nurses of Murugan.
What is going on here, how is it possible that the great Murugan himself kneels and prays?
In the first place, we can infer from the Rig Veda that it was customary in ancient India to perform the sacrificial acts in the morning. And this is wat’s happening here: at dawn the couple Murugan and Valli are on the horizon and pray to Shashthi, who is high in the sky.
This is a photo of the Shashthi crescent early in the morning.
Because, with new moon the sun conjuncts the moon, which means that the sun and moon travel together through the sky and thus they appear together on the horizon early in the morning. And with a full moon, the sun and the moon are opposite each other, so when the sun rises in the east, the full moon sets in the west. But the moon on the sixth day of the moon month stands in between east and west, which means that at dawn the crescent moves in the middle of the sky. So, when the sun rises in Krittika, Murugan is on the horizon together with his spouse, the river goddess Valli, while the crescent of Shashthi is high in the sky.
I will explain this seal to you by means of other ones but first I have to make a confession.



The branches of Murugan and Shashthi on Indus seals
And Shashthi is a fertility goddess just like the Egypt Hathor
I am starting this essay with a single branch that I have completely misunderstood thus far.
M-1296 a
Although all Indus Valley scholars assumed that the left sign on this broken Indus seal was a branch, I was the only one who believed that it was an antler,
Kalibangan-19 a Taxila (Bhir Mound)
because it looked a little bit like the antler of the deer depicted on the oval seal.



Kalibangan-50a Taxila (Bhir Mound)
But the seal on the left makes it clear that this sign cannot be an antler, because the tiger goddess;
1. First wears the horns of a gazelle, which extend to both sides. 2. Then she does indeed wear stag antlers, which also extend to both sides and they look like the antler of the deer depicted on the oval seal. 3. But up there the goddess bears the sign we study, it can't be an antler anymore because it's nonsense to put an antler on antlers, besides it doesn't extend to both sides at all.
And therefore it could indeed be a branch.
M-1181A
This is confirmed in this Mohenjo-Daro seal, for this deity wears upturned cow horns on his head and above them he also carries a single branch. To underline that it is not an antler it has three leaves, which may be from a Banyan, a tree related to the moon goddess Shashthi.



M-1186 A
With this understanding we return to this seal and now we see that here two gods may bear a branch on their head, namely Shashthi and Murugan.
Because, when we take closer look at them then we see that two humanlike deities have the same long braided hair, wear the same cow horns and they may also carry a (partially erased) branch on their heads. These similarities show that they are a couple.
So it appears that both spouses can carry a branch on their heads and with this knowledge we will investigate the next tablet.



H95-2485e
In this Harappa tablet Murugan is the one who carries a branch on his head. He is situated within a big Omega decorated with banyan leaves. This Omega represents his wife Shashthi, who is also symbolized by the thirteen leaves. (To my opinion this scene shows that Murugan and Shashthi are ‘united’).
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus_religiosa
This is such a leaf of a banyan, a tree which is very special because in Hindu mythology it symbolically represents Shashthi:
‘Shashthi or Shashti (-) is a Hindu folk goddess, venerated as the benefactor and protector of children (especially, as the giver of male child). She is also the deity of vegetation and reproduction and is believed to bestow children and assist during childbirth. She is often pictured as a motherly figure, riding a cat and nursing one or more infants. She is symbolically represented in a variety of forms, including an earthenware pitcher, a banyan tree or part of it or a red stone beneath such a tree; outdoor spaces termed shashthitala are also consecrated for her worship.’
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashthi



Shashthi as well as Hathor are symbolized by fig trees
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashthi
This photograph depicts a banyan, a fig, a symbol of Shashthi:
A banyan, also spelled ‘banian’, is a fig that begins its life as an epiphyte, i.e. a plant that grows on another plant, when its seed germinates in a crack or crevice of a host tree or edifice.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banyan
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus_sycomorus
And Hathor is represented by a sycamore tree, like this one:
Hathor was often depicted as a cow, symbolizing her maternal and celestial aspect, although her most common form was a woman wearing a headdress of cow horns and a sun disk. She could also be represented as a lioness, cobra, or sycamore tree.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hathor
And this tree is a fig too:
Ficus sycomorus, called the sycamore fig or the fig-mulberry (because the leaves resemble those of the mulberry), sycamore, or sycomore, is a fig species that has been cultivated since ancient times.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus_sycomorus



H95-2485e Number 1
Again, Murugan with a branch on his head stands in a huge Shashthi-Omega looking like the hair dress of the Egypt goddess Hathor which indicates that they both are fertility goddesses.
‘The Sumerian Omega symbol first appeared as a symbol for a medical device, because it's
use in cutting the umbilical cord of a new born child. The connection to fertility, to birth, to new life is then completed’:
The Sumerian Omega symbol first appeared as a symbol for a medical device, because it's use in
cutting the umbilical cord of a newborn child. This soon translated into a symbol for the meaning of life, or the beginning of life, or new life. An ancient God of Sumeria, also took the Omega as a symbol to represent herself. This was the fertility god, Ninhursag. The connection to fertility, to birth, to new life is then completed. For further reading;
http://trueancienthistory.blogspot.ca/2013/04/the-search-for-lost-arch-of-covenant.html



Kalibangan-26
Turned around this Omega symbol looks like an earthenware pitcher, which symbolizes Shashthi:
‘She (Shashthi) is symbolically represented in a variety of forms, including an earthenware
pitcher, a banyan tree or part of it or a red stone beneath such a tree.’
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashthi
So, both the banyan tree on top and the pitcher (kumbha) below are symbols of Shashthi,
Number 2
We can recognize this pitcher/kumbha in this sculpture of Durga: the draped piece of cloth forms more or less a pitcher and emphasises the fertility of this deity.
A kumbha (Sanskrit: कुम्भ ) is a type of pottery in India. Traditionally, it is made by Kumbhars, also known as Prajapatis.
In the context of Hindu, Jain and Buddhist mythology, the kumbha symbolizes the womb. It represents fertility, life, generative power of human beings and sustenance and is generally associated with devis, particularly Ganga.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumbha



Festivals of Shashti are celebrated every 6th day after new moon, which means that Shashthi is the goddess of the waxing moon:
‘The worship of Shashthi is prescribed to occur on the sixth day of each lunar month of the Hindu
calendar as well as on the sixth day after a child's birth. Barren women desiring to conceive and mothers
seeking to ensure the protection of their children will worship Shashthi and request her blessings and aid. She is especially venerated in eastern India.’
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashthi
And you will no doubt agree that this moon looks a little bit like a bowl.
H-79 a
In this imprint of an Harappa seal six small stripes are added to a curve indicating Shashti, as her name literally means ‘Sixth’. Here the curve looks like a scale instead of a bowl.



M-1734
But the four added stripes in this seal may indicate that Shashti is the main goddess of the four quarters of the earth, or the four quarters of the sky:
Rigveda hymn number 10-19, called: Waters or Cows.
8 O thou Home-leader, lead them home, restore them thou who bringest home. Four are the quarters of the earth; from these bring back to us our kine,
Rigveda hymn number 7-35, called: Visvedevas.
8 May the far-seeing Sun rise up to bless us: be the four Quarters of the sky auspicious. Auspicious be the firmly-seated Mountains, auspicious be the Rivers and the Waters.
M-1718
And in this seal the four little stripes are added to the ‘earthenware’ pitcher/kumbha,
symbolizing the same: Shashthi is the supreme goddess either from heaven or from earth. .



H-238A
And on this tablet five banyan leaves are added to the reversed Omega. They may indicate the fivefold race:
Rigveda hymn number 1-7, called: Indra.
9 Indra who rules with single sway men, riches, and the fivefold race Of those who dwell upon the earth.
So, this broken tablet may state that Shashti and Murugan, who is situated within the Omega, rules the fivefold race.
H-177 B
And on this tablet eight banyan leaves are added to the Omega symbol. They may represent the eight points of the earth:
Rigveda hymn number 1-35, called: Savitar.
7 He, strong of wing, hath lightened up the regions, deep-quivering Asura, the gentle Leader. Where now is Surya, where is one to tell us to what celestial sphere his ray hath wandered?
8 The earth's eight points his brightness hath illumined, three desert regions and the Seven Rivers. God Savitar the gold-eyed hath come hither, giving choice treasures unto him who worships.
And thus this tablet may state that Shashti is the great goddess of the whole earth.



H-179 B
On this tablet thirteen small deities are standing on the Omega. They may represent Shashthi in the twelve Zodiac signs plus Orion. Seeing this and the previous tablets and seals it won’t be surprise that Shashthi is called: ‘the universal female energy’:
In addition, she is associated with Mula-Prakriti, the universal female energy said to be composed of six aspects: one of these, typically the sixth aspect, is said to be Shashthi.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashthi
https://historicaleve.com/why-egyptian-goddess-hathor-important/
A little bit similar to Hathor who is a sky goddess called: ‘mistress of the stars’:
Hathor was given the epithets ‘mistress of the sky’ and ‘mistress of the stars’, and was said to dwell in the sky with Ra and other sun deities. Egyptians thought of the sky as a body of water through which the sun god sailed, and they connected it with the waters from which, according to their creation myths, the sun emerged at the beginning of time. This cosmic mother goddess was often represented as a cow. Hathor and Mehet-Weret were both thought of as the cow who birthed the sun god and placed him between her horns. Like Nut, Hathor was said to give birth to the sun god each dawn.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hathor



H-1719 A
In this imprint Shashthi stands between two branches and next to her is a temple. The point is that different seals, like this one and the seals no. M-492b, M-1186 A, M-1367, M-296 and M-21 indicate that she is related to temples. The reason for this is that she, as a moon goddess, is the Lady of Rohini, a nakshatra symbolized by a temple:
4; 9 Rohini ‘the red one’, a name of Aldebaran. Also known as brāhmī Aldebaran
Lord: Chandra (Moon)
Symbol: Cart or chariot, temple, banyan tree Deity : Brahma or Prajapati, the Creator Indian zodiac: 10° - 23°20' Vrishabha Western zodiac 6° - 19°20' Gemini
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
And therefore she is related to temples too.
Number 3
This is another item that the two goddesses have in common, because this sistrum simply demonstrates that Hathor is also related to a temple (Noas), see also page 29 :
Hathor ‘also commonly carried a sistrum or a menat necklace. The sistrum came in two varieties: a
simple loop shape or the more complex naos sistrum, which was shaped to resemble a naos shrine
and flanked by volutes resembling the antennae of the Bat emblem’.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hathor



M-492 b Temple
M-1367 a Temple
On the right side of these two tablets from Mohenjo-Daro are two temples, which primarily symbolize Rohini. As mentioned before, Shashthi is the Lady of this nakshatra. The point is that Rohini as well as Krittika, the nakshatra of Murugan, are situated in the Zodiac sign ‘the Bull’, and that is why Shashthi and her spouse are depicted here as bovines.
Hathor, in bovine form, emerges from a hill representing the Theban necropolis, in a copy of the Book of the Dead from the 13th century BC
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hathor
And thus Shashthi resembles the Egyptian goddess Hathor who wears a headdress of cow horns, or is depicted as a cow:
Hathor was often depicted as a cow, symbolizing her maternal and celestial aspect, although her most common form was a woman wearing a headdress of cow horns and a sun disk. She could also be represented as a lioness, cobra, or sycamore tree.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hathor
So, Shashthi and Hathor have in common that they are both related to Omegas, fig trees, temples, and cows.



Shashthi is related to the nakshatra Rohini
M-296 A
Styled banyan temple
Every sixth day of every month Shashthi appears in the sky. But Shashthi is especially related to Rohini as she is a moon (Chandra) goddess, and the moon is the lord, or in this case the lady of this nakshatra:
4; 9 Rohini
‘the red one’, a name of Aldebaran. Also known as brāhmīAldebaran
Lord: Chandra (Moon) Symbol: Cart or chariot, temple, banyan tree Deity : Brahma or Prajapati, the Creator Indian zodiac: 10° - 23°20' Vrishabha Western zodiac 6° - 19°20' Gemini Taurus constellation map.png
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
As Rohini is symbolized by a temple and a banyan tree and thus Shashthi is symbolized by the same objects.
https://en.allmetsat.com/climate/pakistan-afghanistan.php?code=41624
At that time the sun passed through Rohini in March which was a rainy month, only during the monsoon more rain was falling down to earth and in the Indus mythology Murugan was the one who brought this rain.



Murugan brings rain
When I have understood the next seals correctly then Murugan and Shashthi cause fertility in agriculture.
H-416 A
To demonstrate this I want to start with this broken seal. Here a man carries two bags looking more or less like the water-skins shown in the next pictures:
Bhai Kanhaiya Ji serving water to the Muslims Water bag from a goat
In a hymn a prayer ask Parjanya (cloud) to open his water-skin and to draw it downwards:
Rigveda hymn number 5-83, called: ‘Parjanya’
‘Thunder and roar: the germ of life deposit. Fly round us on thy chariot water laden. Thine opened water-skin draw with thee downward, and let the hollows and the heights be level. Lift up the mighty vessel, pour down water, and let the liberated streams rush forward. Saturate both the earth and Heaven with fatness,’
And thus, the water-skin man depicted on the broken seal may have brought water to the Indus Valley to saturate both the earth and heaven with fatness.



H-1046
Here is another water-skin man bringing water and rain to the Indus Valley to fertilize the fields and the plant sign next to him suggests that he led vegetation grow.
M-1324 A
On the left side of this seal we see Murugan, recognizable by his U-mark with four horizontal stripes. In the Indus Civilization he is the one who brings water and rain. Next to him is a branch within a womb sign. In the first place this branch indicates that this womb is of Shashthi, but it also indicates that she is a vegetation goddess.
H-152
Again, on the left we see Murugan bringing water and rain with his water-skins. Next to it is the womb of Shashthi with a branch inside and on the far right is a hoe above seed. With this tool the Indus farmers prepared their fields and then they sowed their grain.
o These three signs together indicate that Murugan cause the fertility of the earth with his water skins. o The hoe with seed below of course indicates digging of the furrow and the sowing. o And the branch in the womb of Shashthi indicates that digging and sowing begins on the sixth (Shashthi) of the moon month.



Number 7
This Indus hoe looks like these primitive Egyptian hoes.
H-154
We know the first three characters from the previous seal. They indicate that Murugan brings rain that makes the earth fertile. Therefore digging of the furrow and the sowing can be done. The branch in the Shashthi womb tells us that this digging and sowing starts on the sixth of the month.
The three small lines symbolize the harvest in October or November.
Murugan and Shashthi also have intercourse with each other and from this comes a child. The womb on the right symbolizes the birth of this child in December.
Number 6
1 2 3 4 5 67 8
When we study this seal closely, we notice that Shashthi appears on it four times. I'll show this all without explaining it in detail:
1. The first U-sign represents Murugan. 2. The three headed figure indicate Shashthi, Devasena, Valli as Tridevi (See below). 3. Then Shashthi is represented by a branch within a womb. 4. This womb indicates that digging of the furrow and sowing of the seed starts on the sixth day of the month. 5. The fish indicates the river goddess Valli. 6. Again, Shashthi is represented by a branch within a womb. 7. Here it indicates that seed starts to be harvested on the sixth day (Shashthi) of the October or November. 8. The six divided womb indicates that Shashthi (Sixth) gives birth to a child, who is engendered by her and her spouse nine months before (1 and 2).



H95-2485e
When we look at this tablet again we can now say that the leaves and branches symbolize that Murugan and Shashthi cause the growth of vegetation and that's why we see two fields on the other side of the tablet.
It looks like the Sumerian sign ‘FA’, which means ‘leaf/grass’ in the first place:
A second sign for FA with the meaning 'leaf/grass' is seen in Jaritz #593, u2 (for *û2; but also unknown dialectal *ü for FE). It depicts a 'section of grass/thatch'; and means, in addition to 'leaf/grass': 'food, pasture, plant(s), herb, (flat) bread, loaf (derived from [flat] bread), strong (hard to break, from 'thatch'; properly from FE)', and from the last: 'wood'.
http://reocities.com/proto-language/ProtoLanguage-Monosyllables.htm.
H-48
But in the Indus Valley Civilization this grid symbolized a field because, as we see in this seal, on the 'grid' grows a crop, and so we must conclude that it indeed symbolizes a farmer's field.



The rivers start to rise in March
H-97
On this tablet found in Harappa we see the seven figures representing the nakshatra Krittika (Pleiades), the nurses of Murugan. At that time the sun passed through this small constellation in March. And in this very month the rivers began to rise. Therefore, on the left we see two meandering lines indicating this rising of the rivers.
‘The principal rivers of the Indus River system are snow-fed. Their flow varies greatly at different times of the year: the discharge is at a minimum during the winter months (December to February), there is a rise of water in spring and early summer (March to June), and floods occur in the rainy season (July to September). Occasionally, there are devastating flash floods. The Indus and its tributaries receive all their waters in the hilly upper parts of their catchments. Therefore, their flow is at a maximum where they emerge out of the foothills, and little surface flow is added in the plains, where evaporation and seepage considerably reduce the flow volume. On the other hand, some water is added by seepage in the period after the monsoon months. In the main stream of the Indus, the water level is at its lowest
from mid-December to mid-February. After that the river starts rising, slowly at first and then more rapidly at the end of March. The high-water level usually occurs between mid-July and mid-August. The river then falls rapidly until the beginning of October, when the water level subsides more gradually. Annually, the upper Indus carries about 26.5 cubic miles (110 cubic km)—slightly less than half the total supply of water in the Indus River system. The Jhelum and Chenab combined carry roughly one-fourth, and the Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej combined constitute the remainder of the total supply of the system.’
https://www.britannica.com/place/Indus-River
M-20333 B
As said before, Murugan is married to three goddesses: the moon goddess Shashthi, the storm goddess Devasena and the river goddess Valli. Each time he assumes a shape that is in accordance with the figures of his spouses: he becomes a moon god when he is with Shashthi, he becomes a storm god when he is with Devasena and he becomes a river god when he is with Valli. The latter can be seen on the tablet above. Here he is in a yogi position between fish, crocodiles and meandering lines, which of course all symbolize water and rivers. Seated this way he resembles the river goddess Saraswati who, among others, is said to be wise.



Number 8
Here is a sculpture of Saraswati in a yogi-position, that shows she is a goddess of wisdom.
M-305 A
In this seal Murugan again sits in yogi position, wearing bullhorns and a branch. Because of the two fishes he must be a river god. And the bullhorns indicate that he is in Taurus.
He may be meditating like the Sacrificer in the next Rigveda hymn:
Rigveda hymn number 10-183, called ‘The Sacrificer’
1. I saw thee meditating in thy spirit what sprang from Fervour and hath thence developed. Bestowing offspring here, bestowing riches, spread in thine offspring, thou who cravest children. 2 I saw thee pondering in thine heart, and praying that in due time thy body might be fruitful. Come as a youthful woman, rise to meet me: spread in thine offspring, thou who cravest children. 3 In plants and herbs, in all existent beings I have deposited the germ of increase.
All progeny on earth have I engendered, and sons in women who will be hereafter.
When we put this together that this seal demonstrates that Murugan is the river god the spouse of the river goddess Valli. He may be meditating on the sixth day of the month bestowing offspring.



Murugan and Valli pray to Shashthi
M-488 C
Once more, in this tablet Shashthi stands in a huge pitcher decorated with eight leaves.
The two human shaped deities wear the same horns and they both also have a branch on their heads. They are equal, they are a couple: Shashthi and her husband Murugan who keeps on praying to his wife.
Behind Murugan is the head of Soorapadman, He killed him using his weapon called Vel or Lance:
Lord Murugan is known for eliminating demons named Soorapadman and his brothers Tarakasura and Simhamukha and Sashti Tithi of Shukla Paksha marks his victory over them. It is said that Lord Murugan severed the head of Soorapadman using his weapon called Vel or Lance. Two birds
emerged from the severed head – a peacock that became his vahana and a rooster that became an emblem on his flag.
https://curetosoul.com/skanda-sashti-significancemythological-factsritual/
And this mythical animal with its meandering horns is the river goddess Valli. (See below.)



M-296 A
This seal depicts two equal unicorn heads symbolizing the same couple Shashthi and Murugan. It is clear that they are united with each other and thus they engender a child. Therefore, the nine leaves can symbolize nine months of pregnancy.
(See also the two similar cows on the seals M-492 and M-1367 representing Murugan and Shashthi as a couple in Taurus).
BM 120228
Similarly, the two equal U-signs with four dashes symbolize the same couple: Murugan and Shashthi. The four small horizontal stripes on each sign may indicate that they both are the rulers of the earth or the sky.



M-986 a
There are also 2 U-signs on this broken seal.
1. As on the previous seal, the left one symbolizes with its four horizontal stripes that Murugan is the ruler of the earth or the sky. 2. The second U sign also has four small stripes but these stripes are vertically oriented:
a. In the first place symbolizing that Shashthi is the mistress of the earth or sky, b. But these stripes also symbolize that she is also a vegetation goddess as we can see on the following seals.
H-48 M-0274
In the left seal we see a field on which barley grow and in the right we see the same crop but now as part of the second U-sign: this sign may symbolize that barley was harvested on the sixth of the month..



https://www.harappa.com/blog/two-clay-sealings-harappa
Once again, in this imprint Shashthi stands between two branches, which may indicate that she is the deity of vegetation:
Shashthi or Shashti (Sanskrit: षष्ठी , Ṣaṣṭhī, literally ‘sixth’) is a Hindu folk goddess, venerated as
the benefactor and protector of children (especially, as the giver of male child). She is also the deity of vegetation and reproduction and is believed to bestow children and assist during childbirth.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashthi
M-1983 A M-1921 A
The left imprint shows the branch which is also processed in the left U-sign in the right seal.
H-151 A
Usually branches are depicted like the one at the right,
H-130 a
But the branch at the left is a little bit styled.



H-129 a
Just like this one also situated at the left.
H-47
In the middle of this seal we see the same styled branch twice as part of the U-sign symbolizing that Shashthi is a vegetation deity.
H-577 A M-1163
In the left seal we see another kind of crops (soma?). On the right we see the same crop but as part of the second U-sign. This sign may symbolize that this crop was harvested on the sixth of the month.



Shashthi as Tridevi
K-50 A
As said before in this seal the tiger goddess wears horns of a gazelle, antlers and a branch on her head, They indicate that this goddess is Tridevi:
o The branch on top represents Shashthi. o The antlers indicate Devasena. o And the horns of a gazelle indicate Valli
Valli is a river goddess and she is one of the three spouses of Murugan. It is clear that March is a fertile month: not only does it rain a lot, but the water in the rivers also starts to rise because the snow in the mountains begins to melt in the spring.:
‘The principal rivers of the Indus River system are snow-fed. Their flow varies greatly at different
times of the year: the discharge is at a minimum during the winter months (December to February), there is a rise of water in spring and early summer (March to June), and floods occur in the rainy season (July to September). Occasionally, there are devastating flash floods. The Indus and its tributaries receive all their waters in the hilly upper parts of their catchments. Therefore, their flow is at a maximum where they emerge out of the foothills, and little surface flow is added in the plains, where evaporation and seepage considerably reduce the flow volume. On the other hand, some water is added by seepage in the period after the monsoon months. In the main stream of the Indus, the water level is at its lowest
from mid-December to mid-February. After that the river starts rising, slowly at first and then more rapidly at the end of March. The high-water level usually occurs between mid-July and mid-August. The river then falls rapidly until the beginning of October, when the water level subsides more gradually. Annually, the upper Indus carries about 26.5 cubic miles (110 cubic km)—slightly less than half the total supply of water in the Indus River system. The Jhelum and Chenab combined carry roughly one-fourth, and the Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej combined constitute the remainder of the total supply of the system.’
https://www.britannica.com/place/Indus-River
The moon goddess Shashthi, the storm goddess Devasena and the river goddess Valli put together lead to Tridevi and Murugan is the husband of them all.



H-179B3
On this Harappa tablet, Murugan, standing in the Shashthi Omega, wears three feathers or three branches on his head, symbolizing he is a Trimurti: he has three feathers or branches because being the spouse of Shashthi he is a moon god, being the spouse of Valli he is a river god and being the spouse of Devasena he is a storm god.
H-179 A
Three headed goddess
On the other side of this tablet we see that a three-headed figure is next to the U-sign. Here Murugan may be represented by the U sign with four horizontal stripes and his three spouses are united in the three headed figure (Tridevi) in the middle.
So, in this tablet Murugan has three feathers as he is Trimurti and his three spouses are depicted as Tridevi with three heads.



Dholavira
In this seal from Dholavira the three spouses of Murugan are united in a mythical animal with three heads. Murugan himself sits on its back.
Mehrgarh 489 B
Murugan and Valli bird Murugan and Devasena Three headed Shashthi
On the right side of this tablet we see this three-headed animal again, this time without Murugan on its back:
o Thus, the three-headed animal symbolizes that Devasena, Valli and Murugan are united. This happens on the sixth day of the month when Shashthi comes out. o In the middle Murugan celebrates a Sacred Marriage to Devasena, who is indicated by the bird next to them. It is clear that this marriage happened on the sixth day of the month. This corresponds to the marriage of Shiva and Parvati, which is celebrated on Sitalsasthi, the sixth day of the bright fortnight of the month of Jyestha:
Sitalsasthi: Sixth day of the bright fortnight of the month of Jyestha (Hindu Calendar) The marriage of Shiva and Parvati is celebrated as Sitalsasthi. It is celebrated as a carnival, in which people and artists from different walks of life participate, making it more beautiful and bringing out the true colour of life.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashthi
o The two quadrupeds at the left represent Murugan and Valli. They are indicated by the neem tree between them.
And thus this tablet shows Murugan and his three spouses.



Shashthi is indicated in many ways
M-1368 a
This and the following steals show a U-mark with four horizontal stripes, all of them symbolize that Murugan as the ruler of heaven or earth. In addition, each time there is a different sign and as you will see, these signs always symbolize or indicate Shashthi.
In the above seal, Shashthi is symbolized by the vertical scale like on seal number H-79 (see above).
M-1344 a
It won’t be a surprise any longer to see that in this seal Shashthi is symbolized by a branch.
H-140
And here she is represented by a banyan leaf.



M-1568 A
In this tablet she is depicted as Tridevi having three heads.

And here she is indicated by the temple sign, the symbol of Rohini in the first place.
H-661
In this seal Shashthi is represented by the twelve stripes inicating the twelve times Shashthi appears in the sky on the sixth day of the month:
Rigveda hymn number 1-25 called: Varuna. 8 True to his holy law, he knows the twelve moons with their progeny: He knows the moon of later birth.



H-87
In this seal Shashthi is indicated by the grid in the middle of the inscription, as Shashthi is a vegetation goddess. This grid has three times six squares.
o The vertical rows of six squares will indicate Shashthi (Sixth). o The horizontal rows of three may indicate that Shashthi is Tridevi.
M-1811 A
On this seal are two womb signs that are divided into six:
o The first womb sign indicates that a child was conceived on the sixth of the month of March by Murugan (represented by the U-sign) and Shashthi (the first six-divided womb). o The second womb sign indicates that Shashthi gives birth to this same child on the sixth of December.
The last seal clearly shows that Shashthi is a mother goddess.



Number 4
In this picture Shashthi stands on her mount, a cat. In her left arm she holds a child end with her right hand she lift another child. This scene shows that Shashthi is indeed a mother goddess:
Shashthi or Shashti (Sanskrit: षष्ठी , Bengali: ষষ্ঠী , Ṣaṣṭhī, literally ‘sixth’) is a Hindu goddess,
venerated in Nepal and India as the benefactor and protector of children. She is also the deity of vegetation and reproduction and is believed to bestow children and assist during childbirth. She is often pictured as a motherly figure, riding a cat and nursing one or more infants. She is
symbolically represented in a variety of forms, including an earthenware pitcher, a banyan tree or part of it or a red stone beneath such a tree; outdoor spaces termed shashthitala are also consecrated for her worship.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashthi
Number 5
Again, Shashthi and Hathor have a lot in common because Hathor is a mother goddess too as can be seen in this wall relief, in which she feeds her son Iya:
Hathor (Ancient Egyptian: ḥwt-ḥr ‘House of Horus’) was a major goddess in ancient Egyptian
religion who played a wide variety of roles. As a sky deity, she was the mother or consort of the sky god Horus and the sun god Ra, both of whom were connected with kingship, and thus she was the symbolic mother of their earthly representatives, the pharaohs.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hathor



Number 5a
Besides, in this relief Hathor helps a woman who gives birth to child, with this she does the same as Shashthi who also assists during childbirth:
Shashthi or Shashti (Sanskrit: षष्ठी , Bengali: ষষ্ঠী , Ṣaṣṭhī, literally ‘sixth’) is a Hindu goddess,
venerated in Nepal and India as the benefactor and protector of children. She is also the deity of vegetation and reproduction and is believed to bestow children and assists during childbirth. She is often pictured as a motherly figure, riding a cat and nursing one or more infants.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashthi
Nevertheless, there is also a big difference between the two goddesses, as Shashthi is a moon goddess,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hathor
And Hathor was solar deity:
Solar goddess
Hathor was a solar deity, a feminine counterpart to sun gods such as Horus and Ra, and was a member of the divine entourage that accompanied Ra as he sailed through the sky in his barque.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hathor



This is a photo of Shashthi early in the morning. The sun rises in the east and Shashthi, the goddess of the sixth day of the month, is already high in the sky.
And the next seals may demonstrate that Shashthi is indeed a sky goddess.

But I first show you the Egyptian hieroglyph for ‘sky’.
M-1271
And this tablet shows the Indus sign for ‘sky’, which is a little bit similar to the Egypt hieroglyph, I think.



M-649
Now we are able to understand this seal that shows a branch on a sky-sign. This branch of course indicates Shashthi and placed on a ‘sky-sign’ it demonstrates that on the sixth day of the month Shashthi is the ‘head’ of the sky.
Ganweriwala tablet https://www.harappa.com/blog/glimpses-ganweriwala
Here the moon goddess sits in a yogi position with a crescent above her head on the celestial symbol: she is high in the sky and now we may call her here ‘The Lady of the Sky'. Murugan sits below her: in the morning he is with the sun on the horizon while his wife is high above him.



M-1186 A
Again on this seal Shashthi is in a large pitcher decorated with banyan leaves. Next to this pitcher is a temple sign.
The banyan and the temple are both symbols of the nakshatra Rohini.
Rohini, ‘the red one’, a name of Aldebaran. Also known as brāhmī Aldebaran Astrological Mate: Chandra (Moon) Symbol: Cart or chariot, temple, banyan tree Rigvedic name: Prajapati, the Creator Indian zodiac: 10° – 23°20′ Vrishabha Western zodiac: 6° – 19°20′ Gemini
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
And the seven ladies below represent Krittika (the Pleiades), the nurses of Murugan:
Krittika, an old name of the Pleiades; personified as the nurses of Kārttikeya, a son of Shiva. Astrological Mate: Surya (Sun) Symbol: Knife or spear Rigvedic name: Agni, god of fire
Indian zodiac: 26°40′ Mesha – 10° Vrishabha Western zodiac: 22° 40′ Taurus – 6° Gemini
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
And so this seal shows that Rohini is above and Krittika is below.
This corresponds exactly to what we see on this part of the sky map: in the morning Rohini is above and Krittika is below. Isn’t that surprising?
Let’s take a closer look at the three deities.



M-1186 A
As mentioned before, the banyan and the temple are both symbols of the Rohini in the first place and thus they also indicate Shashthi, the Lady of this nakshatra.
Here is Murugan indicated by the head of Soorapadman beneath him
Lord Murugan is known for eliminating demons named Soorapadman and his brothers Tarakasura and Simhamukha and Sashti Tithi of Shukla Paksha marks his victory over them. It is said that Lord Murugan severed the head of Soorapadman using his weapon called Vel or Lance. Two birds emerged from the severed head – a peacock that became his vahana and a rooster that became an emblem on his flag.

M-1186 A M-1179 a
And the scene at the left shows the river goddess Valli, who is depicted like a sphinx. She is indicated by the fish above her back and also by her meandering horns, that of course symbolize the river.
She is more or less similar to the mythical animal depicted on right seal, that represents Murugan as it is obviously male. This shows that when Murugan marries his river spouse Valli, who is symbolized by the two meandering lines, he himself becomes more or less equal to her, he becomes a similar mythical animal with similar horns.



In this photo we see the sun rising from the water. When this sun is in Krittika, it seems as if Murugan, the god that comes from this nakshatra, is united with the water; so with Valli.
H-97:
At the left of this tablet three rectangles depict three pillars. They may symbolise Dawns mounting eastward, like pillars planted at our sacrifices:
Rigveda hymn number 4-51, called: ‘Dawn’.
1. Forth from the darkness in the region eastward this most abundant splendid light hatb mounted. Now verily the far-refulgent Mornings, Daughters of Heaven, bring welfare to the people.
2 The richly-coloured Dawns have mounted eastward, like pillars planted at our sacrifices, And, flushing far, splendid and purifying, unbarred the portals of the fold of darkness. 3 Dispelling gloom this day the wealthy Mornings urge liberal givers to present their treasures.
Because of these three pillars, we must realize that the whole scene takes place in the morning, which means that the seven Krittika, the Pleiades, are situated on the horizon.



M-257
Here the pillar at the left may symbolize that when the Sun hath risen heaven is stablished like a firm-set pillar:
Rigveda hymn number 5-45, called: ‘Visvedevas’.
1. Bards of approaching Dawn who know the heavens are come with hymns to throw the mountain open.
The Sun hath risen and opened the stable portals: the doors of men, too, hath the God thrown open. 2 Surya hath spread his light as splendour: hither came the Cows' Mother, conscious, from the stable, To streams that flow with biting waves to deserts; and heaven is stablished like a firm-set pillar.
So in this seal a pillar indicates the morning again.
h2026C
So, in the morning Murugan sits on the horizon and prays to his spouse Shashthi because in the morning the rites are performed and the prayers are said:
Rigveda hymn number 1-48, called: ‘Dawn’.
1 Dawn on us with prosperity, O Usas, Daughter of the Sky, (-) 9 Shine on us with thy radiant light, O Usas, Daughter of the Sky, Bringing to us great store of high felicity, and bearning on our solemn rites.
Rigveda hymn number 9-99, called: ‘Soma Pavamana’.
5 They purify him as he drops, courageous, in the fleecy sieve. Him they instruct as messenger to bear the sage's morning prayer.
Rigveda hymn number 3-28, called: ‘Agni’.
1. Agni who knowest all, accept our offering and the cake of meal, At dawn's libation, rich in prayer!
Rigveda hymn number 1-92, called: Dawn.
15. O Dawn enriched with holy rites, yoke to thy car thy purple steeds, And then bring thou unto us all felicities.



H-177 B
From the hymns we can tell that the best time to make love is in the morning:
Rigveda hymn number 1-124, called: ‘Dawn’.
7 She seeketh men, as she who hath no brother, mounting her car, as 'twere to gather riches. Dawn, like a loving matron for her husband, smiling and well attired, unmasks her beauty.
Rigveda hymn number 1-179, called: ‘Rati’.
1 'Through many autumns have I toiled and laboured, at night and morn, through age-inducing dawnings. Old age impairs the beauty of our bodies. Let husbands still come near unto their spouses. 2 For even the men aforetime, law-fulfillers, who with the Gods declared eternal statutes, -They have decided, but have not accomplished: so now let wives come near unto their husbands.
So, in the morning Murugan may marry his two spouses.
M-442 A
And that's why in the morning the gods bring children to the loving couples:
Rigveda hymn number 1-125, called: ‘Svanaya’.
1. Coming at early morn he gives his treasure; the prudent one receives and entertains him. Thereby increasing still his life and offspring, he comes with brave sons to abundant riches.
Rigveda hymn number 4-51, called: ‘Dawn’. 10 O Goddesses, O Heaven's refulgent Daughters, bestow upon us wealth with store of children. As from our pleasant place of rest ye rouse us may we be masters of heroic vigour.



Why was Murugan that important in the Indus Valley
M-442 B
It appears that the nakshatras Rohini, Krittika and Bharani were very important in the Indus Valley Civilization that lasted from 3300 BCE to 1300 BCE
The Indus Valley Civilisation (IVC), also known as the Indus Civilisation, was a Bronze Age civilisation in the north-western regions of South Asia, lasting from 3300 BCE to 1300 BCE, and in its mature form from 2600 BCE to 1900 BCE. Together with ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was one of three early civilisations of the Near East and South Asia, and of the three, the most widespread, its sites spanning an area stretching from today's northeast Afghanistan, through much of Pakistan, and into western and north-western India.
Because from 4320 BCE to 2160 BCE the sun passed through Taurus in March, when a new year began:
Twins (Gemini), 6480 to 4320; Bull (Taurus), 4320 to 2160. Ram (Aries), 2160 to 0;
then Fishes (Pisces), 0 to A.D. 2160. According to Berossus, , the zodiacal Ages were turning points in the affairs of gods and men.
The Earth Chronicles Handbook: A Comprehensive Guide to the Seven Books of The Earth Chronicles Door Zecharia Sitchin
And when the sun passed through Taurus, it passed through Krittika and Rohini at the same time, so from 4320 BCE to 2160 BCE a new year began with these two nakshatras. That is why Murugan and Shashthi were such important gods in this period, because Krittika brought forth Murugan as a saviour and Shashthi was the Lady of Rohini.
