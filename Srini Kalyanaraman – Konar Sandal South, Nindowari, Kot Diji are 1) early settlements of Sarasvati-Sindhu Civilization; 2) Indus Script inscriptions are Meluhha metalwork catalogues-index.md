m1634 ceramic stoneware bangle (badge)
Read from r. to l.:
Vikalpa: The prefix Sign 403: Hieroglyph: bārī , 'small ear-ring': H. bālā m. ʻbraceletʼ (→ S. ḇālo m. ʻbracelet worn by Hindusʼ), bālī, bārī f. ʻsmall ear -- ringʼ, OMārw. bālī f.; G. vāḷɔ m. ʻ wire ʼ, pl. ʻ ear ornament made of gold wire ʼ; M. vāḷā m. ʻ ring ʼ, vāḷī f. ʻ nose -ring ʼ.(CDIAL 11573) Rebus: bārī 'merchant' vāḍhī, bari, barea 'merchant' bārakaśa 'seafaring vessel'. If the duplication of the 'bangle' on Sign 403 signifies a plural, the reading could be: karã n. pl. wristlets, bangles Rebus: khār 'blacksmith, iron worker'.
Sign 403 is a duplication of bun-ingot shape. This shape is signified on a zebu terracotta pratimā found at Harappa and is consistent with mūhā mẽṛhẽt process of making unique bun-shaped ingots (See Santali expression and meaning described below):
I suggest that Sign 403 is read: dul mūhā mẽṛhẽt 'cast iron ingot'.
Thus, the hypertext may read: 1. dul mūhā mẽṛhẽt uṟukku 'cast iron ingot,steel' or 2. khār uṟukku 'blacksmith, steel'. If he squirrel is read as šē̃ṣṭrĭ ʻflying squirrel' rebus: śrēṣṭhin 'guild master' (Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa), the reading of the hypertext is: 1. dul mūhā mẽṛhẽt śrēṣṭhin 'cast iron ingot, guild-master' or 2. khār śrēṣṭhin 'blacksmith, guild-master'.

Kot Diji Coordinates: 27°20′44′′N 68°42′24′′E Situated at the foot of the Rohri Hills, ancient site at Kot Diji (Sindhi: ڪوٽ ڏیجي ; Urdu: کوٹ ڈیجی ) is a Sindh settlement of early Sarasvati-Sindhu Indus Civilization. The occupation of this site is attested at 3300 BCE. The remains consist of two parts; the citadel area on high ground (about 12 m), and outer area...earliest fortified town to date is found at Rehman Dheri, dated 4000 BCE in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa close to River Zhob Valley. Other fortified towns found to date are at Amri (3600–3300 BCE) and at Kalibangan (3000 BCE), India at the Hakra River. In early layers of Kot Diji lithic material, such as leaf-shaped chert arrowheads, parallels with Mundigak layers II-IV. The pottery seems to anticipate Harappan Ware. Later, bronze was used, but only for personal ornaments. An interesting find at Kot Diji is a toy cart.

This Kot Diji Phase Period 2: 2800-2600 BCE sealing of Harappa has the Indus Script hieroglyphs. This Early Harappan seal impression or sealing of a square seal has several script signs and two ladder like motifs (Kot Diji Phase Period 2: 2800-2600 BCE) when the bundle was opened. Since this sealing was found in a hearth area, it is probable that the raw clay was hardened accidentally when it was swept into the fire along with other trash, possibly even the rope or reeds used to bundle the goods (HARP): ko ̤ru 'sprout' Rebus: ko ̤ru 'bar of metal'; koḍa 'one' rebus: koḍ 'workshop'; baṭa = rimless pot (Kannada) Rebus: baṭa = a kind of iron
Rebus: bhaṭa 'furnace; baṭa 'pot' + kárṇikā 'handle of a vessel, round protuberance, rim of jar'; PLUS cāl 'furrow' rebus: sāla 'workshop'; together, the expression is: bhāṭi karaṇa sāla 'furnace writers' workshop'. Two Ladder Hieroglyphs: śrēṣṭrī 'ladder' Rebus: seṭh ʻ head of a guild' PLUS dula 'two' rebus: dul 'metal casting'.
On this Kot Diji phase steatite button seal from Harappa (H2000-4495 / 959701), traces of blue-green glaze can be seen (upper center and left center). Similar seals have been found at other Kot Diji period sites and even in distant Central Asia.
[quote] The manufacture of seals shows a dramatic change during the later part of the Early Harappan or Kot Diji Phase Period 2: 2800-2600 BCE. The early button seals made of carved bone from the Ravi phase (Meadow, Kenoyer and Wright 1998) are replaced with carved soapstone or steatite seals having geometric incised designs (Meadow, Kenoyer and Wright 1996; Meadow, Kenoyer and Wright 1998). Some of these seals are bleached white and glazed to create a hard surface suitable for repeated stamping (Figure 3). The discovery of a terracotta sealing of a square seal with script and a geometric or plant motif indicates that they were in fact used for such purposes. An unfinished seal with an elephant motif also provides the earliest evidence for the local manufacture and use of large symbolic animals on the steatite seals (Kenoyer and Meadow 2001 in press).

In conjunction with the use of seals there is also evidence for the manufacture and use of cubical limestone weights, that would have been used for weighing valuable commodities or for taxation (Meadow, Kenoyer and Wright 1999). There is no concrete evidence for copper or gold working at Harappa, but the diversity of copper tools, utensils and ornaments and the presence of various types of gold beads and pendants from the Early levels suggests that such crafts were also being practiced at the site. There is also evidence for various types of bangle manufacture using exotic materials such as marine shell and local materials such as terracotta



15
(Figure 4). Both wide and narrow bangles were made from the marine shell Turbinella pyrum using simple techniques of incising with stone tools, grinding, and polishing. Shell bangles are relatively rare during the Ravi Phase, but gradually become more common during the Kot Diji and later Harappan Phase. Terracotta bangles were hand formed and the exterior was pinched to create a raised ridge. In the later levels of the Ravi Phase (circa 3000-2800 BCE) and the subsequent Kot Diji Phase (2800-2600 BCE), the variety of terracotta bangles increases dramatically to include flat painted bangles, rounded bangles, and one having incised decorations. While at first most of the bangles were made with red fired terracotta, in the later levels there are grey-fired bangles with highly polished and incised surfaces. In some cases, multiple bangles were joined together while still unfired to form a single, wide bangle decorated with intricate carved designs.[unquote]

article Konar Sandal South, Nindowari, and Lakhan Jo daro - Beyond the Limits of a Known World. The article accomplishes a number of things. One is that it again offers evidence that the early Bronze Age world was indeed deeply connected. It seems as if the success of different civilizations was linked, at times, to their interactions with neighbours. Secondly, it suggests that "Kupin," a reference to a westward culture and political actor might refer to the "Kulli" culture known from Nindowari and elsewhere in Balochistan. From Rita Wright's analysis, it may have been a competitor to the ancient Indus polity in the southern Balochistan region, if not elsewhere: "Clearly, the Kulli were an independent group wedged in between the Indus, the coast of the Makran and groups to the west, and the Arabian Peninsula. On the matter of overland trade, there are many routes of travel to Konar Sandal South and from there easy access to gulf waters to the south that lead to crossings at the Straits of Hormuz (Wright 2010: 226, 2002; Pittman 2013). Most likely a political rival of the Harappans, the specifics of the relationship between the Kulli and the Harappans is uncertain, but there is every reason to believe that there were economic and political connections" (p. 31). Thirdly, the paper is one of the few available to say anything about Lakhan Jo Daro, a large ancient Indus site just to the south of the Rohri hills where flint was mined during Indus times (and for hundreds of thousands of years before!). Now occupied by the modern city of Sukkur in Sindh, it has hardly been excavated at all. Still, nuggets of evidence help Wright make her case for interactions between it, the Kulli, and the Halil Rud civilization (Konar Sandal South) near Jiroft in Iran. The site of mass looting not too many years ago which exposed another major Bronze Age culture that traded with the Indus, Kulli and Mesopotamians. It may well be what was called "Marhashi" in Mesopotamian texts, given the peculiar soft stone vessels discovered there and which were once highly prized in Mesopotamia. Wright marshals the evidence clearly and concisely, is clear about open questions and speculation, and "demonstrate[s] that the regions discussed were not isolated and were part of a known world" (p. 33). As ever, ancient people and civilizations surprise us with their many connections; their world was much bigger and richer than we might assume. https://www.harappa.com/content/konar-sandal-south-nindowari-and-lakhan-jo-daro-beyondlimits-known-world
