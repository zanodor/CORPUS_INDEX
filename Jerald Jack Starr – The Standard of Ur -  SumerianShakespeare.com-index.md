The Royal Standard of Ur, "peace side", three-quarter view. PG 779,
the tomb where the standard was discovered, is seen below. The
standard is circled in red. The object next to the standard is the skull of
the standard bearer. Click on any of the images to enlarge them.

PG 779.
The Standard of Ur was discovered by Leonard Woolley in PG (“Private
Grave”) 779 in the Royal Tombs of Ur. It was found above the shoulder of
a man, as though it had been
carried aloft on a pole. Woolley therefore thought it was a standard, the
kind that was carried in front of the troops in battle or during ceremonial
processions of the king. Hence the name, the “Standard” of Ur.
Roman battle standard.
This theory soon fell out of favor. Recent scholarship suggests that the
standard is possibly a sound box for a musical instrument. This is how it is
described by the British Museum, where the standard is kept. I personally
never bought into this theory. The war side of the standard, with scenes of
wounded and dying men, naked prisoners cinched up with ropes,
What is the Standard of Ur? about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/41101.html

and bodies being trampled beneath charging chariots, is a bit too
gruesome to be a decoration on a musical instrument.
There are also other reasons to suggest that the standard is not a sound
box:
First, it doesn’t resemble any of the other stringed instruments that were
found in the tombs, such as the lyres and harps (see Lyres, The Royal
Tombs of Ur). None of these instruments have a trapezoid shape like the
Standard of Ur. Second, the standard doesn't include any of
the accessories usually associated with a musical instrument, such as
tuning pegs and the attachments used to anchor the strings. Third, since
all four of the vertical surfaces are covered in mosaic inlays, there’s no
place to attach the strings on the sides, like on a lyre; and there’s no
support plate to indicate the strings were attached to the top, like on a
harp. Last but not least, the mosaic inlays are set in bitumen, a soft tar
like substance that is not very hard or durable. Therefore the standard
could not withstand the rough handling that is
routinely applied to a shoulder-mounted instrument, like the
lyre shown on the standard:
Shoulder mounted lyre, as seen on the Standard of Ur. The lyre is
supported by straps that go around the lyre and over the shoulder of the
musician. Note the attachment of the strings on the side of the lyre.
Other lyres found in the Tombs of Ur were “Great Lyres” that are very
large. For example, the Silver Lyre is 38 inches across. They were mounted
What is the Standard of Ur? about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/41101.html
3 of 11 8/18/2020, 2:57 PM



on the floor or a table when played. The mosaic inlays on the lyres are only
on the front plate and in narrow borders on the sides, so they weren't
subject to a lot of handling. The standard, on the other hand, is quite small
(8.5 x 19.5 inches) so it’s too small to be a floor-mounted instrument,
and the mosaic inlays make it too delicate to be a hand-held instrument.
In addition, any soundbox needs to be a thin‐walled structure, like a
modern guitar, so the sides can vibrate (resonate) and thus
amplify the sound. The heavy inlays of shell, lapis, and limestone
embedded in soft bitumen make the sides of the standard too thick for this
purpose. In fact, it would actually have the opposite effect, being a "sound
dampener". It is therefore unlikely that the Standard of Ur
was a musical instrument.
Another theory, advanced by Paola Villani, suggests the standard was used
as a chest to store funds for warfare, civic projects, and religious works. It
seems a plausible explanation since there is a small door in one of the end
panels through which the funds could be added or removed.
The Standard of Ur end panel,
"peace side", with an access door at the bottom.
Nonetheless, there are a couple of problems with this theory.
What is the Standard of Ur? about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/41101.html
4 of 11 8/18/2020, 2:57 PM



First, the door is too small for a man to fit his hand through it to pull out
the ingots of gold
and silver (Sumerians didn't have metal coins). The alternative is to shake
the standard like a piggy bank to remove the ingots, but the inlays are too
delicate for this kind of handling.
Second, the Standard of Ur is too small to contain enough funds to finance
a war, a temple,
or a civic project (such as building a canal), especially since the door
being on the bottom
makes it difficult to stack the ingots very high.
Besides, there were other more practical and secure ways to store the
funds, so the theory that the Standard of Ur was a cash box is not widely
accepted.
The current theory, 85 years after the standard was discovered, is that “we
just don’t know” the original purpose of the Standard of Ur.
I would like to propose a “new" theory, one that is suggested by the
standard itself:
Battle line, the Standard of Ur. Left: The Sumerian soldiers attack in a
phalanx formation. Middle: There is a brief battle. Right: The enemy runs
away, as seen below:
The enemy retreat. They flee before the Sumerian king (left).

An enemy soldier, third from the right in the retreat
scene. Enlarge.
This soldier is carrying something under his arm. He is the only soldier,
either friend or foe, who carries something other than a weapon, so it is
symbolically important. Unfortunately, the object is damaged and it's
difficult to tell what it is. Upon closer examination, however, it looks oddly
familiar. The hole on the bottom looks like the object is meant to be
mounted and displayed on the pole he is carrying. The dark line on the
bottom represents one of the lower edges. The hole in the middle is where
the pole would be inserted. The object has the same trapezoid shape as the
Standard of Ur, with sloping sides and a narrow width. This is exactly how
the Standard of Ur would look if held at the same angle. I suggest
the object is the equivalent of a "furled standard", indicating defeat. This
standard, which the enemy proudly carried aloft while marching into the
battle, is now carried in disgrace under the arm of a standard bearer in
headlong retreat. It is the perfect symbol of a defeated enemy.
The fact that a standard was removable from its pole suggests the access
panel on the side was part of a locking mechanism by which the standard
was fastened or removed.

There is yet another standard on the Standard of Ur. The above picture
shows the king inspecting the prisoners taken in battle. It was originally
assumed he was holding a spear, and the object on it was perhaps a tassel
symbolizing royalty. The object is actually a standard, shown from the
side. Despite its damaged and eroded condition, it is clearly the same
trapezoid shape as the end panel of the Standard of Ur. See a high
resolution photograph of this standard.
Once it's known what to look for:

A Sumerian soldier dispatches a fallen enemy with his spear.
This soldier is right behind the Sumerian king during the battle.
Interestingly, he is the only person on the Standard of Ur who doesn't
have both feet planted flat on the ground. He is shown kicking something
as he drives his spear into the belly of the enemy. Notice the square area
where he is kicking. I would suggest that it is another fallen battle
standard, which is now missing due to damage. The standard broke off
along the straight outlines where it was deeply incised into the figure. This
is not just erosion like the rest of the damage done to the figure. Above the
missing standard is the broken staff that was used to hold it aloft. Click
here to clarify the scene.
As described in The Standard of Ur: King, the presence of a standard is an
artistic device that is used to identify a king. The above picture symbolizes
the death of the enemy king and the destruction of his army. The
aforementioned "standard bearer" with his standard under his arm is also
a king.
It seems that the Standard of Ur is all about standards. There definitely
three, probably four, and possibly five different standards on The
Standard of Ur.
The prisoners are presented to the Sumerian king.

The captive enemy king (left) is escorted by a Sumerian soldier. This is
the same king who was earlier seen being captured (above). His skirt and
robe have been restored to him for the formal surrender ceremony.
It looks as if the Sumerian soldier is holding something in his
hands, displaying it for the Sumerian king. Perhaps it's the captured
enemy's battle standard. The presentation of the captured standards was
part of traditional surrender ceremonies in the ancient world. This
would perfectly symbolize the victory of the Sumerian
king. He imperiously holds aloft his own battle standard while being
presented with the captured standard of the defeated enemy.
Unfortunately, the figure is too damaged to tell if a standard is being
shown.
It seems unlikely that the Standard of Ur itself was an actual battle
standard, the kind that was carried into combat. The mosaic inlays are too
delicate for the rigors of war and the imagery is too complicated. A battle
standard needs to be recognizable from a distance, so it should have only
one simplified symbol, not the intricate tableau seen on the Standard of
Ur. A Sumerian battle standard probably had crossed battle axes, for
instance, or perhaps Anzud, the lion-headed eagle, a symbol of war (much
like the mythological creature shown on the Roman battle standard
pictured above). It's also unlikely that a battle standard would have a
"peace side". The War and Peace sides indicate that it's a royal standard,

the kind of standard carried during processions of the king.
So Mr. Woolley was right all along. The Royal Standard of Ur is a royal
standard after all.

Standard of Ur narratives
4-5 minutes
The Standard of Ur, peace side, circa 2500 BC.
The Royal Standard of Ur is the icon of Sumerian civilization. It shows the
Sumerians in war,
the Sumerians in peace, and the Sumerians in the practice of their
religion. Every book
or website about the Sumerians includes a picture of the Standard of Ur.
The word “icon”
is much overworked these days (everything is “iconic”) but the Royal
Standard of Ur
is literally the icon of an entire civilization, in the same way the Statue of
Liberty is the icon
of American civilization.
The Standard of Ur was discovered almost 100 years ago. It has always
Standard of Ur narratives about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/900401/index.html
1 of 5 8/18/2020, 2:57 PM



been regarded as a work of art, but it has never received proper credit for
what it really is: an historic record.
It has been given only a cursory examination by the historians, with very
little commentary
as to its content. If you do an Internet search on the Royal Standard of Ur,
you will find that very little has been written about it (and half of it isn't
true).
The king, peace side.
For almost a century, no one ever tried to figure out the message that is
conveyed on the Standard of Ur.
That’s because the Royal Standard of Ur is classified as “possibly a sound
box for a musical instrument”. This is how it’s described by the British
Museum, where the standard is kept.
It is difficult to take the standard seriously as an historic record if it’s just
a music box.
As explained on the page, What is the Standard of Ur?, there was never
any chance that the standard was a musical instrument. The Standard of
Ur is exactly what Leonard Woolley
Standard of Ur narratives about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/900401/index.html
2 of 5 8/18/2020, 2:57 PM



said it is − a royal standard. The evidence is provided by the standard
itself (you may want to read that page before proceeding with this one,
although it is not entirely necessary).
It trivializes the Royal Standard of Ur to call it a mere music box (it's like
saying the
Statue of Liberty is "probably a lamp"). It deprives the standard of its
proper place in history.
Not only is this a royal standard, the ensign of a king, but it is the oldest
royal standard
in the world (by far).
This standard belonged to a king, a great king, one of the first great kings
in world history.
If archeologists were fortunate enough to find the royal standard of
Alexander the Great,
it would be a sensational discovery, but it would not be as historically
important as the
Standard of Ur, because this standard is more than 2,000 years older than
Alexander.
He died in 323 BC. There's as much time between Alexander and the
standard as there is between us and Alexander.
The battle scene on the standard is not just some generic decorations on a
music box.
It is a highly detailed account of a specific battle, fought by a specific king,
against a
specific enemy.
In this battle, a Sumerian king of Ur defeated the Akkadian king of Kish in
personal combat.

He thus became the new King of Kish, the ruler of Sumer and Akkad, the
“King of Kings”.
This battle was the king’s greatest victory, the proudest moment of his life,
and the fulfillment
of his life-long ambition. That is why it is immortalized on the war side of
the standard.
The peace side of the standard shows us how he ruled his Sumerian and
Akkadian subjects
after the war was over.
The imagery on the Standard of Ur is not just “symbolic” or “emblematic”,
it is a complete narrative. It is a complex and subtly nuanced tale of War
and Peace. The war side of the standard shows us exactly how the battle
was fought, and how it was won (it was an epic battle, and a bloody one).
The peace side subtly illuminates the geopolitics of Mesopotamia,
especially the complicated relationship between the Sumerians and the
Akkadians. Even
the end panels, which are usually described as “fanciful scenes”, are
complete narratives.
They have their own stories to tell.

− ruthless in war, but magnanimous in peace.
This royal standard always accompanied the king. Wherever he went, so
did the standard.
When people saw this standard, they knew they were in the presence of
the King of Kings.
For them, the message on the Standard of Ur was clear:
Resist the king and die in war, or accept the king and live in peace.

The Royal Standard of Ur.
As previously stated, this royal standard belonged to a Sumerian king of
Ur. He defeated
the Akkadian king of Kish in battle to thus become the new King of Kish,
the ruler of Sumer
and Akkad, the “King of Kings”.
At first it may seem odd that a Sumerian king made such a big deal about
being the ruler

of a single foreign city-state, but there's a reason for this.
Kish was the most powerful city-state in Akkad. Throughout Akkad, the
king of Kish was considered to be the “King of Kings” because he held
hegemony over all the other
Akkadian kings and they owed him at least a nominal allegiance. The title
“King of Kings”
was coveted by many ambitious Sumerian kings during this period of
history. They figured if
they conquered Kish then they would be the new King of Kings. Of course,
it wasn’t enough
for a Sumerian king to merely conquer the city of Kish. To truly deserve
the title, to be the
king who ruled other kings, he needed to conquer the Kish allies as well,
so their kings
would also owe him allegiance. To conquer the Akkadian allies, he needed
his own
Sumerian allies. Therefore, when a Sumerian king assumed the title of
“King of Kish”
(King with a capital K) he was proclaiming that he was the new King of
Kings, the ruler of
both Sumer and Akkad.
The Akkadian allies
The Akkadians wear a distinctive “angled
skirt”.
We know this is the allied army of the Akkadians, and not just the army of
Kish, because
the Akkadians wear three different types of skirts − depending on which
city they are from.
The hems of the skirts are slightly-angled or sharply-angled, as shown on
the left. These
skirts have a fine fringe on the bottom (see an enlargement). A third kind
Standard of Ur narrative, war side about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/900401/933301.html

of skirt is pleated. The Akkadian allies are from neighboring city-states.
This means there are at least three different Akkadian armies fighting
against the Sumerians. There are the three main armies. There may have
been more. Some other smaller armies may not be represented on the
Standard of Ur.
Generally, the Akkadian allies spent most of their time fighting among
themselves,
but now they have put aside their differences (for a while) and they are
united together
in helping the king of Kish to repel this foreign invasion by the Sumerians.
The Sumerian allies
Like the Akkadians, Sumerians wear different skirts depending on which
city they are from. The Sumerian soldiers wear four different skirts (but all
of them wear the spotted cloak, the uniform of the army of Ur). This
means the king of Ur has Sumerian allies from at least three
other city-states (perhaps more). He needed all the allies he could get if he
ever hoped to defeat the powerful king of Kish and the Akkadian allies.
This highlights the second part about being a Sumerian King of Kish. It
wasn’t enough to
conquer Kish and the Akkadian allies. To truly be the King of Kings, to be
the ruler of Sumer and Akkad, he needed to control most of Sumer as well.
He probably had some willing Sumerian allies who supported his bid for
the Akkadian throne (in exchange for a share of the loot) but most of his
Standard of Ur narrative, war side about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/900401/933301.html

“allies” were Sumerian city-states that he already conquered, so their
“support” was guaranteed. Both Eannatum and Lugalzagesi, two other
Sumerian kings of Kish during this period of history, conquered most of
Sumer before they even considered attacking the mighty king of Kish and
his Akkadian allies.
All told, there are at least seven different armies on the field − four
Sumerians armies and three Akkadian armies – and probably more. It
wouldn’t be a bit surprising if there were a
dozen armies on the field during the actual battle. This is not just a local
dispute between two neighboring lords in the region. It is an epic battle
between two great nations. Basically,
all the armies of Sumer are fighting against all the armies of Akkad. The
fate of both nations hangs in the balance.
A narrative of the events portrayed on the Standard of Ur
The battle shown on war side of the Standard of Ur starts with the ending.
It begins with the surrender ceremony, after the battle is over. This is an
awkward place to start the narrative,
so I rearranged the standard into chronological order.
Top: The Sumerian soldiers attack in a phalanx formation. There is a
brief battle and the Akkadian soldiers begin to retreat.
Middle: The retreat becomes a rout when the Sumerian king leads a
chariot attack
to run down the fleeing Akkadians.
Bottom: The king has dismounted from his chariot and he presides over

surrender ceremony.
Imagine a battlefield somewhere in Akkad, moments before the battle
begins. The two
great armies of Sumer and Akkad stand on opposite sides of the field,
staring at each other.
The stage has been set for one of the greatest battles in Mesopotamian
history.
The narrative on the Standard of Ur, like so many Sumerian narratives,
begins with a
Sumerian attack.
The infantry attack
Battle line. Enlarge.
This picture is usually interpreted as "the Sumerian soldiers march to war"
because they seem to march in a measured cadence. However, a close-up
of the picture reveals that their spears are leveled forward (the spear point
of each soldier is outlined on the cloak of the soldier in front of him).
Soldiers don't carry their spears this way when they are marching.
They march with their spears held vertically. The leveled spears is an
attack stance. The soldiers are not marching to the battle, they are already
engaged in combat, in a phalanx,
on the attack.

man is in uniform.

than each man bringing his own weapons to the battle, as occurs in tribal
warfare. Their helmets and spearpoints are made of copper. The soldiers
wear spotted cloaks. The spots are the identifying insignia of the army.
The uniforms of each city-state had different markings
to make the soldiers easy to identify on the battlefield.
The soldiers attack in a tight, disciplined formation, with many men acting
as a single unit. This isn't the disorganized mob of individual combatants
that is typical of primitive warfare. These men are not just warriors, they
are soldiers. They are professionals.
In the actual battle, the soldiers carried shields, like the ones shown on the
Vulture Stele,
but the artist omitted this detail to concentrate on the soldiers’ uniforms.
On the Royal Standard of Ur, the soldiers in the Sumerian phalanx are
commoners,
men of the rank and file. Ahead of them, their noble lords lead the attack.
The battle of the noble lords

Akkadian lords.
In ancient battles, opposing lords of the nobility often sought out each
other to engage in
personal combat. Ever conscious of their rank, they preferred to fight
against other lords,
while letting the common soldiers kill each other. Bravery in battle is
highly esteemed
among the nobility. Throughout all of ancient history, the greatest glory
for any nobleman
was to kill or capture an enemy lord in individual combat, up close and
personal.
A Sumerian charioteer.
Sumerian noblemen (and kings) were distinguishable by their shoulder
armor (the garment may be fleece, or leather armor made to resemble
fleece). It's the same kind of armor worn by the king in the surrender
ceremony. As part of an elite fighting force, all of the charioteers also wear
this type of armor. Chariot warfare was always the domain of the wealthy
nobility, since the chariots were costly to build and the horses were
expensive to buy and to maintain.

On the Standard of Ur, bleeding wounds are
drawn with
a few wavy lines. There are at least 21 bleeding wounds
on the enemy soldiers. This doesn’t include many other
wounds that do not show up on some of the badly
damaged figures. This is a very bloody battle, at least
for the Akkadians. No Sumerians are killed or wounded
in the attack.
A Sumerian lord captures an Akkadian lord. The captive lord has bleeding
wounds on his chest and legs. He has been stripped of his clothing. This
was a common practice in ancient Mesopotamia. A captured soldier was
immediately stripped of his clothes to deprive him of his personal identity
and his dignity. It was meant to humiliate the prisoner and to demonstrate
that he has no rights and no status, at all. The nakedness of the prisoners
on the Standard of Ur symbolizes their newly degraded condition and
their inferiority to the victorious Sumerians.

This is the Sumerian king, heroically leading his troops from the front. He
carries a curved sickle sword, a symbol of royalty. He has just defeated the
king of Kish in personal combat. He has wounded the king, taken him
captive, and stripped him of his clothes. He has the
skirt of the enemy king draped over his arm and he holds the king’s robe
in his hand.
The "dis-robing" of the enemy king is symbolic of victory.
Notice the position of the prisoner’s left hand, tucked inside his right
armpit. This isn't just
the way he fell. The defeated king performs the universal gesture of
submission and
obedience. This gesture occurs three times on the Royal Standard of Ur

(and on other
Sumerian works of art). In this particular case, it is also the gesture of
surrender.
In this way, the captured king of Kish formally acknowledges his defeat.
Look at the square box between the legs of the enemy king. This is his
royal standard,
just like the Standard of Ur. The fallen standard symbolizes the abject
defeat of the
captive king of Kish.
On the Standard of Ur, the presence of a standard is an artistic device that
is used to identify
a king.
Referring back to the previous picture:
A Sumerian soldier (lord) dispatches a fallen Akkadian king with his
spear. This soldier is
right behind the Sumerian king during the battle. Interestingly, he is the
only person on the
Standard of Ur who doesn't have both feet planted flat on the ground. He
is shown kicking
something as he drives his spear into the belly of the enemy. Notice the

square area where
he is kicking. It is another fallen battle standard, which is now missing due
to damage.
The standard broke off along the straight outlines where it was deeply
incised into the figure.
This isn't just erosion like the rest of the damage done to the inlays. Above
the missing standard is the broken staff that was used to hold it aloft. Click
here to clarify the picture.
The enemy retreats
The scene has always been described as "the enemy prisoners are led
away". This seems
to be a likely explanation since some of the men (the prisoners) are naked,
and some of
the men (the guards) are clothed and carrying weapons. However, this
interpretation was
based on the assumption that the men in the angled-skirts were the allies
of the Sumerians,
the auxiliary troops that were fighting in the Sumerian army. As
previously explained,
the men in the angled-skirts are not the friends of the Sumerians, they are
the enemy.
In this context the meaning of the scene is clear:
The Sumerians attack the enemy. They defeat the enemy in battle. The
enemy runs away.

The Akkadians flee before the Sumerian king (left).
This is the pivotal moment of the battle. Right here, at the point of the
king's sword, is where the Akkadians lose the battle, and the war.
In the above scene, some of the men are wounded and some of them are
not. Some of
the men still have their weapons, while others have thrown theirs away in
panic.
One soldier glances back in horror at what’s happening to his king, while
his comrades
face in the opposite direction, looking to escape. In the middle, an enemy
soldier supports
a wounded comrade and helps him to hobble away from the battlefield.
Behind them,
a soldier clutches at a chest wound with one hand and he tries to cover his
nakedness
with his other hand. He is followed by another soldier with a sword. This
is the only soldier
(other than the Sumerian king) who carries a sword, indicating he is a
high-ranking officer, probably a general. On the right, three soldiers
“lead” the Akkadians in ignominious retreat. They were the first to run
away. Click here to enlarge the picture.

An Akkadian king, third from the right in the retreat scene.
This Akkadian king is carrying his royal standard under his arm. He has
detached the standard from its shaft (the hole in the middle is where the
pole was inserted). This is the equivalent of a "furled standard", indicating
defeat. This standard, which the king proudly carried aloft while marching
into the battle, is now carried in disgrace under his arm while he flees
from the battle in headlong retreat. It is the perfect symbol of a defeated
enemy.

After seeing what happened to their king, the Akkadians lost heart and
fled in panic.
Did it really happen this way? Or is this scene just a symbolic
representation of "Victory”?
Many ancient kings portrayed themselves personally killing an enemy king
to symbolize
their victory in battle, whether or not it really happened this way. So the
question is:
Did the king of Ur actually defeat the king of Kish in individual combat?
Personally, I think he did, given the kind of man he was. This is back in
the day when men were men, and kings were kings, and they led their
troops from the front. He had been dreaming of this moment for years,
when he could finally face the king of Kish in battle. He was a warrior
king, he had been in numerous battles, and he had proven himself in
combat many times. This is why he had the respect of his soldiers and the
confidence of the nobility, who valued bravery in battle above all else, and
this is why he was in command of a great Sumerian army.
I’m sure that as the battle raged around him, he made a beeline straight
for the king of Kish,
in the same way that Alexander made a beeline for Darius at the battle of

Gaugamela
2,000 years later. Like Alexander, the king of Ur was personally very
aggressive.
He had been on military campaigns for years (mostly against the
Sumerians, possibly
against the barbarians, and probably against several Akkadian cities to get
the war started
and to force the king of Kish to come out and fight). He was more a
warrior than a king.
On the other hand, the king of Kish was probably more of an
administrator, like Darius, accustomed to running the kingdom from his
palace, more of a king than a warrior.
Darius had once proven his courage in battle when he was young, but
when he was older,
he didn't feel compelled to prove it yet again. The same is probably true
for the king of Kish. They showed up at their respective battles expecting
their armies to duke it out while they commanded the action from a safe
remove. Alexander and the king of Ur made the battles personal by
rushing straight toward their adversaries. Darius was lucky enough to
escape
(at least for a while). The king of Kish was not so fortunate.
I suggest this was the Sumerian king’s plan all along: to charge straight at
the king of Kish
and kill him, and thus resolve the matter (once and for all) with a single
stroke of the sword.
He knew this would break the Akkadians’ will to fight. I further suggest
that he would have killed the king of Kish right then and there, had the
king not quickly surrendered.
When they saw the capture of their king, the Akkadians knew the battle
was over. The issue had been decided. They no longer had a king to fight
for. Now the only thing left to do was
get away as fast as possible and not be killed or captured in a battle that
was already lost.

complete rout when the Sumerian king calls for his chariot and he leads
the attack
to run down the fleeing Akkadians. Like Eannatum on the Vulture Stele,
the king of Ur
personally leads his troops into battle, both on foot and in a chariot.
In ancient battles, when an army formation broke ranks and turned its
back on the enemy,
it became ineffective as a fighting force because the soldiers could no
longer provide
mutual support for each other. Individual men, or groups of men, could
then be surrounded
and killed. Once the ranks were broken, a retreat easily became a rout,
with
disproportionately high casualty rates for the losing side. This is what is
happening
on the Standard of Ur.
The Sumerian chariot attack
Some of the chariots have been photographically restored. See Sumerian
War Chariots.
At first glance, the driver looks rather portly to be a charioteer. A
charioteer cannot be too
overweight. A heavy driver would slow down the chariot and tire out the
horses. Actually,
he just looks this way because he is sitting on top of the railing with his leg
slung to the

inside of the chariot. He seems rather nonchalant going into combat
sitting down, but that's
because this is the last chariot in the battle line and it hasn't yet reached
"attack speed"
like the other chariots. As explained below, this telling detail adds to the
realism of the
chariot attack scene.
In the next scene, the chariot attack begins to pick up momentum. The
horses break into
a run. Their legs stretch further apart and their heads are leaning forward.
Taken altogether:
The chariot attack begins slowly. The soldiers carry their weapons "at
shoulder arms" and the driver is casually sitting down. The horses are
walking. Then they break into a run, thus demonstrating the increasing
impetus of the attack. Now the driver is standing up while the passenger
brandishes his weapon. The horses trample over a fallen enemy soldier.
The Sumerian prepares to finish him off with a spear...

Now the horses are at a full gallop, piling up more bodies. Their heads
strain further forward
the faster they run. Then the horses rear up victoriously
over the vanquished enemy.
(It’s easy to imagine that it is just one chariot at four different stages of the
attack.)
Compare the dynamic realism of this chariot attack to the
stilted and formalized
chariot scene of Ramses II, which was done 1,200 years later.
The king, of course, is in the first chariot, leading the attack. His chariot
has a peak on the front panel to differentiate it from the other chariots.
The others have a straight edge along
the top.
During the chariot attack, the Akkadians are not in formation, they carry
no weapons, and
they offer no resistance. They are utterly defeated, ”run to ground” by the
charging chariots.
The battle is over. The Sumerian king has won a glorious victory.
The surrender ceremony

The victorious king has dismounted from his chariot. He wears a long
regal robe and
he carries his royal standard. A close-up reveals that he holds a weapon on
his shoulder
(probably the sickle sword, which is now lost due to damage). His generals
are lined up
behind him. They wear their armor in the Sumerian fashion, draped
across one shoulder.
They carry spears and battleaxes. We know they are generals, and not
common soldiers,
because this is the formal surrender ceremony, so the generals would
naturally be
in attendance. According to the rules of royal precedence, they stand
behind the king
in the order of their rank and their titles of nobility. In art, as in life, the
most important men
are the ones standing closest to the king.
Look at the "little man" beneath the horses' heads. He has been described
as a groom,
the kind that takes care of horses. There's no direct evidence that he's a
groom, except for
the fact that he walks in front of the horses. He has also been called a
commoner or a slave, drawn smaller than usual to denote his lowly status.

Actually, he is not a man at all,
but just a boy. He is a royal prince, the son of the Sumerian king. He is
accompanying his father on the campaign, following in his father's
footsteps, as it were, and learning how to become a warrior and a king.
This has always been the royal tradition.
The royal prince
The mark on the back of his head suggests a royal diadem or perhaps a
youthful haircut,
like a "topknot". This mark is not seen on any of the images of the men on
the standard,
nor is the mark seen on any other Sumerian depictions of boys. In his left
hand he would
have carried a spear or battleax (now lost due to damage) like the soldiers
in front of him.
The weapon would be toy-like. The prince is "playing soldier", imitating
the men that are standing with the king. But he's not really a soldier; he’s
too young to fight.

The young prince
“playing soldier”
(At the risk of sounding un-sholarly, I think it's rather cute.)
The object that the prince carries on his shoulder is a royal scepter. It of
course belongs to his father, since a royal scepter symbolizes the right to
rule, and the prince is too young to be a reigning monarch. The
unexpected appearance of the royal prince, playing soldier and carrying
his father's royal scepter, is part of a rather surprising and touching family
vignette here on the field of carnage.
This raises the possibility that the three generals lined up behind the
Sumerian king may also be his sons, arranged in descending order from
oldest to youngest.

inspecting the prisoners captured in battle.

The king on the Standard of Ur is drawn larger than the other men to
symbolize his great importance. In fact, he actually exceeds the decorative
border of the panel.
He carries his royal standard. It is just like the Standard of Ur, shown
from the side.
Despite its damaged and eroded condition, it clearly has the same
trapezoid shape
as the end panels of the Standard of Ur. See a high-resolution photograph
of the standard.
Of course, it is not The Royal Standard of Ur. It is the king’s previous
standard.
The king will soon have a new standard made, one that commemorates the
glorious victory
that he won here today, when he became the King of Kish.
Standing In front of him is the former king of Kish. His clothes have been
restored to him
for the surrender ceremony, to make him identifiable to the viewer. Notice
how small he is
in relation to the Sumerian king.

The captive king of Kish (left). He is guarded by a Sumerian soldier.
Like the Sumerian king, the king of Kish also wears a robe (see the
outlines of the robe in a separate picture). They are the only two men on
the standard who wear robes, so the robes are symbolic of kingship.
The captive king (probably) has a rope around his neck, like the other
prisoners behind him, but the figure is too damaged to be certain. It’s also
possible that the Sumerian soldier presents to his king the captured
standard of the king of Kish. The presentation of the captured standards
was part of the traditional surrender ceremonies in the ancient world. This
would perfectly symbolize the victory of the Sumerian king. He
imperiously holds aloft his own standard while being presented with the
captured standard of his defeated enemy. Unfortunately, the figure is too
damaged to tell if a standard is being shown.
Standing behind the captive king of Kish are the captured Akkadian lords.

The prisoners and their captors: The Sumerian lords proudly
present to their king
the enemy noblemen that they personally captured in battle. The
Sumerian in the middle
has captured two prisoners; the other Sumerians captured one apiece. All
of the prisoners
have bleeding wounds, their hands are bound, and they have ropes around
their necks.
The prisoners are displayed for the king in the descending order of their
rank, with the
most important ones being shown first. The presence of the Sumerian
noblemen,
identifiable by their shoulder armor, confirms the fact that the prisoners
are indeed
high-ranking Akkadian lords. The Sumerian noblemen would not proudly
display
for their king a few piddling privates that they captured, nor would these
haughty lords
stoop to performing guard duty for mere common soldiers. Everyone in
the top register
of the Royal Standard of Ur, Sumerians and Akkadians alike, are high
ranking noblemen.
Since all of the captured Akkadian lords are naked, cinched up with ropes,
and displayed in a humiliating manner, there can be little doubt as to their
fate. The victorious Sumerian king wasn't the kind of man who would

execute common soldiers that were captured (because he wanted to make
allies of his former enemies, as will later be shown on the peace side of the
standard). The opposing noblemen, on the other hand, might not be so
lucky. Although in ancient warfare a conquering king sometimes pardoned
the defeated lords who fought against him, more often than not they were
executed. They would thus be held accountable for the war and for the
casualties suffered by the king's army. Then their estates, titles, and land
could be confiscated by the king, to defray his expenses and to distribute
among his allies as the spoils of war. Besides, if allowed to live, the lords
could lead another attack against the king.
Look at the way the Akkadian noblemen are being paraded before the
victorious king. The
fact that they are naked, bound, and cruelly displayed, without deference
to their high rank, does not bode well for their immediate future. Another
ominous sign is the fact that all of the Sumerian soldiers still carry their
carry weapons. This is not entirely necessary since the prisoners are
securely tied up and they are no longer a threat. Nor would it be necessary
if they are about to be pardoned by the king.
The king intends to be conciliatory to the Akkadians in peacetime, and he
expects their
loyalty in return. On the peace side of the standard, he accepts the
allegiance of the
Akkadian lords who did not fight against him.
As for the lords seen here, they can expect no mercy. He wouldn't
dishonor them this way
if he intends to pardon them. He knows he can't humiliate lords of the
realm in this manner,
then expect them to turn around and become his faithful retainers. So he
has no intention
of sparing the lives of the Akkadian noblemen. This scene occurs just
moments before
all of them were put to death.

The king of Ur, face to face with
the king of Kish.
As for the captured king of Kish, there’s never been any doubt as to his
fate. It didn’t
do him any good to surrender. His death is a foregone conclusion, because
there cannot be
two Kings of Kish. There cannot be two “King of Kings”.
The Sumerian king risked everything on this battle, including his own life.
Had he not been victorious in combat, he’s the one who would have been
executed, not the king of Kish.
In addition to a new standard, the king will also get a new helmet. Here he
wears a plain military helmet (that was made of gold). From now on, he
will wear wear a different helmet,
the helmet of a Sumerian King of Kish, which features the hairstyle of
Akkadian royals.

The helmet of a Sumerian King of Kish, with a knotted bun on the back.
This battle was the king’s greatest victory, the proudest moment of his life.
That is why
it is immortalized on the Royal Standard of Ur. It was an epic, bloody
battle, involving
at least seven different armies. The standard shows us how the battle was
fought and
how it was won. The battle began when the Sumerians attacked in a
phalanx formation,
marching inexorably forward. The opposing lords of the nobility sought
out each other
to engage in individual combat. The battle was won when the Sumerian
king charged
straight for the king of Kish and defeated him in personal combat. Seeing
this, the
Akkadians lost heart and began to retreat. The retreat became a complete
rout when the Sumerian king led the chariot attack that ran to ground the
fleeing soldiers.

The Victory Banquet
After the battle, the king sits at a banquet with his lords. He wears a
kaunakes, a skirt made of woolen leaf petals. The kaunakes is the official
attire of royalty. In one hand he holds a cup of wine. In his other hand he
holds a royal scepter (or probably a date cluster, a symbol of royalty, as
shown on a plaque). The front legs of his chair are shaped like ram legs.
The king is drawn larger than everyone else to symbolize his great
importance. He exceeds the decorative border of the panel.
The king is attended by a servant. Another servant waits on the lords. His
left hand is tucked inside his right armpit, the gesture of submission and
obedience. The servants are drawn smaller than the king and the lords to
signify their lowly status. Even while standing they are no taller than the
seated noblemen.
Each of the lords holds a cup of wine, raised in salutation to the victorious
king.

The king and his noblemen listen to the music of a bull-headed lyre,
accompanied by a
priest. Because of the long hair, it’s tempting to say this a woman, and
thus a priestess
rather than a priest. Although Sumerian priests were usually shown with
shaven heads,
some of them had long hair (or wore a wig), as shown on a Sumerian
plaque from the
city of Mari. Besides that, the priest shown above is wearing male attire.

it's cut in two halves and stacked one on top of the other to fit onto the

way it looked when it was passing by. The Sumerians lead the procession,
the defeated Akkadians follow behind.

An Akkadian leads a ram for the sacrifice. He wears his hair in the
Akkadian fashion. It is long and curly on top but short on the sides. He
also has a beard. He wears the “double belt” of the Akkadians. His angled
skirt is hidden behind the ram he is herding.
On the war side of the standard, all of the Akkadians are shown bald to
deprive them of their individual and national identities, as a way of saying,
“all enemies look alike.” On the
peace side, the Akkadians have their distinctive hairstyle. Their personal
and national identities have been restored.

is a very important dignitary. Unfortunately, the figure is too damaged to
be properly identified (I’m very curious about
this person).

Except for one Sumerian, all the men in the third register are Akkadians.
It’s easy to see why the men in the angled-skirts were originally believed to
be the friends and allies of the Sumerians. Here it seems they are joyfully
bearing gifts to celebrate the king's victory; "bringing food to the picnic",
as it were. However, the meaning and importance of this scene changes
dramatically when it's realized that the men in the angled-skirts are
actually the defeated enemies. They come bearing tribute for the
conquering Sumerian king.
The replacement lords
The Akkadians are led by a man with his hands folded in prayer. He has
the Akkadian hairstyle, but he doesn’t wear an angled-skirt. He wears a
version of the kaunakes, the skirt worn by royalty.
These three figures are similarly attired. I suggest they are the
"replacement lords",
who were appointed to replace the captured lords that were executed after
the battle.

Sumerian king.
Tribute
The Sumerians in the procession willingly bring food and sacrifices for the
banquet because this is a thanksgiving celebration for the victory of their
king. The same cannot be said for the Akkadians. They do not come
bearing gifts. The goods they carry are not voluntary contributions.
Instead, the Akkadians bear tribute for the Sumerian king. This is only to
be expected. They lost the battle on the war side of the standard, so it's
inevitable that they be seen on the "flip side" of the standard carrying
tribute to the victors. The display of defeated enemies bearing tribute to
the conquering king was a common motif in the ancient world.
Notice the different
angles of the Akkadian skirts.
Two Akkadian tribute bearers. They carry the tribute in bags and in
backpacks. The packs are supported by head straps.
The Akkadians carry lots of tribute to the conquering Sumerian king. The
fact that many Akkadians in the procession are loaded like pack animals,
carrying an abundance of goods, demonstrates to the Sumerian people
that their king protects them from their enemies and he provides them

There are three pairs of Akkadian tribute bearers. They are bent down
under their loads.
They seem to reel and stagger beneath the weight. In the procession, the

are the only ones who carry a load. None of the Sumerians carry a heavy
burden.
Not even the donkeys carry a load.

suggest it looked
a lot like this. It was a spiked headdress with tips that curve backwards. It

These are the “replacement kings.” They were named to replace the
Akkadian kings who
were killed in battle or executed afterward. They are the “client kings” (i.e.,
the puppet kings)
of the king of Ur. They are his men now. They owe him allegiance. They
will administer the Akkadian kingdoms on his behalf, under his direct
supervision, because he is now the new
King of Kings.
Interestingly, none of the kings wear the slightly-angled skirt of the king of
Kish, who is conspicuously absent from the proceedings. There will be no
“political appointee”
to fill this very important job. It belongs exclusively to the Sumerian king.
He alone will be
the king of Kish.
Notice that the Akkadian peasants, lords, and kings, all pay homage to the
new Sumerian King of Kings.
The heavy tribute may seem as though the Sumerian king is imposing a
harsh peace on his Akkadian subjects, but actually the opposite is true.
What’s most interesting about the peace side of the Standard of Ur is what
we don’t see.

We don’t see prisoners yoked in neck stocks and being marched into
slavery.
We don’t see long lines of prisoners of war with ropes around their necks,
being paraded before the Sumerian people to show the military might of
their king.
We certainly don’t see anything like this:

for resisting
the king (detail from the siege of Lachish, circa 700 BC).
In the victory procession, the Akkadian people are not paraded before the
Sumerian king like trophies of war, as one would expect to see in this
portion of the panel. If the defeated enemies were foreign barbarians (the
Gutians, for instance) they would be displayed in the victory procession as
slaves or prisoners of war (naked, bound, and in neck stocks) like in a
thousand other victory processions throughout the ancient world. On the
war side of the standard, the captured Akkadian lords are naked and
degraded, with their arms cinched up behind them and ropes around their
necks, but on the peace side, the Akkadians are free and unfettered. They
are not displayed as miserable slaves, like spoils of war. They are not even
under guard; there are no armed Sumerian soldiers in the victory
procession.
On the war side, only a few Akkadian lords felt the wrath of the Sumerian
king, for their “rebellion” against his “rightful” claim to the Akkadian
throne. On the peace side, there are no reprisals against the Akkadian
people.
The peace side of the standard perfectly illustrates the complicated
relationship between the Sumerians and the Akkadians. The relationship
was sometimes symbiotic, sometimes
bloody. They worshiped the same gods and they shared many of the same
cultural values. They spoke different languages, but through the centuries
developed a kind of bilingualism. They also benefited from their mutual
trade. So far as the Sumerians and Akkadians were concerned, they were
the only civilized people, everyone else was just foreign barbarians.
Most of the time they were at peace (the Sumerians usually fought against
each other, the Akkadians fought among themselves). At other times they
were locked in bloody combat, each seeking domination and control of the
other. The Sumerians and Akkadians had been
at war, off and on, for thousands of years. They were like two neighbors
who had fought
often enough to start making up some rules about it, like an unspoken
Geneva Convention.
As a result, their wars were far more civilized than most wars in the
ancient world. They

never waged “total war”. They never fought wars of genocide or
annihilation. They never
sought to crush or destroy each other, or to enslave the opposing
population. Instead, the
losing side simply became a vassal state of the winning side. The losers
also had to pay
tribute (taxes) to the victorious king.
Sometimes it was the other way around. Sometimes the Sumerians were
conquered by
an Akkadian king of Kish, most notably Sargon the Great. Sargon was a
complete bastard
in most regards, but even he did not impose a punitive peace on the
Sumerians. He did not destroy the Sumerian cities he conquered, but he
merely made breaches in the city walls, rendering the cities indefensible
and thereby discouraging rebellion.
On the Standard of Ur, the defeated Akkadians are treated firmly but
fairly. This is how a Sumerian King of Kish ruled his Akkadian subjects,
because he wanted to make allies
of his former enemies.
The defeated Akkadians bear lots of tribute to the conquering Sumerian
king, but this is only right and proper, since they're the ones who lost the
war. The heavy tribute shows the consequences for resisting the Sumerian
king. Otherwise the Akkadians are treated quite leniently. In fact, this
must be the “kindest, gentlest” victory procession ever recorded. It speaks
volumes that ever since the standard was discovered (90 years ago) the
men were thought to be the allies of the Sumerians rather than the
defeated enemy. Ironically, this had been the purpose of the scene all
along, that the enemies now appear as allies.
On the Standard of Ur, the defeated Akkadians are now like the
Sumerians, they are the subjects of the great king, the Sumerian King of
Kish. It demonstrates that the king provides a just peace for all of his
subjects.

A similar message is conveyed on the personal seal of Mesannepada, the
founder of the First Dynasty of Ur. He was a Sumerian King of Kish. Part
of the inscription translates as “Mesannepada, the King of Kish”. This seal
impression shows a Sumerian and an Akkadian involved in a struggle
together rather than against each other. An Akkadian king is stabbing the
lion that is attacking the Sumerian hero, Gilgamesh. This conveys the idea
that the Sumerians and Akkadians are now allies, the same message that is
shown on the Standard of Ur.
Note the spiky headdress with pointed tips that curve backwards. This is
the crown of an Akkadian king, the same kind of crown that is worn by the
Akkadian kings on the Standard
of Ur. This is an Akkadian king of Kish, recognizable by his long flowing
beard and the
knotted bun on the back of his head. Like Gilgamesh, he is a "mythical"
king, because
real kings are never shown nude.

The new allied army
None of the common Akkadian soldiers who were captured in battle
remained in captivity.
They are now the soldiers of the king of Ur. They have been enlisted into
his new army,
the allied army of Sumer and Akkad.

A Sumerian King of Kish on the Standard of Mari. He holds a battle
standard featuring a
bull statuette. Mari is an Akkadian city. (See the page on The Standard of
Mari)
In the new army of the Sumerian king, there are clean-shaven Sumerians
and bearded men from the city of Mari (and other Akkadian cities). Their
uniforms are a blend of Akkadian and Sumerian styles. The skirts and the
helmets are Sumerian, the sashes are Akkadian.
The uniforms are spotted, like the uniforms on the Standard of Ur.
This is the new coalition army of a Sumerian King of Kish, the ruler of
Sumer and Akkad.
Whenever a Sumerian king defeated his Akkadian enemies to become the
new King of Kish,
he would portray himself as the legitimate ruler of both nations, and his

former enemies
would then be portrayed as his loyal subjects (whether they liked it or
not). In this regard,
the Standard of Ur and the Standard of Mari both serve the same purpose.
(I personally believe it's the same king on both standards.)
The Standard of Ur is all about the Sumerian King of Kish, ruthless in war,
but magnanimous in peace. On the war side, he is like the young
Alexander the Great, a veteran of numerous battles, leading his troops
from the front, and seeking out his enemies to engage in
personal combat. He is the king of war. On the peace side, he is like the
mature Alexander.
In the same way that Alexander tried to unite the Greeks and Babylonians,
the king of Ur
attempts to unite the Sumerians and Akkadians under a single beneficent
rule. He is the
king of peace.
Who is the king on the Standard of Ur?
On the Standard of Ur: King, I make a very compelling case that he is
Eannatum because the known history of Eannatum matches perfectly
with the events portrayed on the standard. However, this may be
something of a stretch since Eannatum was originally from Lagash,
not Ur (although he did conquer Ur to become its king). Perhaps a better
choice would be Meskalamdug. Another possibility would be his son,
Mesannepada. There were many Sumerian kings of Kish during this
period of history. They all had a similar modus operandi, and they all had
similar stories to tell. For now, the identity of the king on the Standard of
Ur cannot be known with absolute certainty.

Standard of Ur, end panels
3-4 minutes
End panels on the Royal Standard of Ur.
The end panels have always been described as "fanciful scenes". However,
it seems
unlikely that the artist filled the front and back of the standard with a
complex and
subtly nuanced tale of war and peace, and when he came to the end
panels, he suddenly
threw up his hands and said, "Okay, I've run out of ideas, here are some

fanciful scenes
to pass the time."
I suggest the end panels have a deeper meaning. It seems that the end
panels, like the front and back of the standard, also represent “war” and
“peace”.
The Standard of Ur end panel, “War Side”.

In the top register, a ram is feeding on the high branches of a tree. This
image occurs on many Sumerian artifacts and it seemed to be symbolic of
Sumer itself. The identity of the damaged creature on the right, with
hooved feet and a tail, isn't known. It may be a "bull/man", a recurring
figure in Sumerian mythology.
In the middle register, a Sumerian boy is making a ceremonial offering to
the ram. Then
the Akkadian enemy in the angled-skirt shows up. It’s not exactly clear
what he is doing
with the ram. The object that he holds in his hand has been damaged, but
the end of it looks
like the pommel of a sword or a dagger. It seems the blade goes across the

body of the ram
in the same way that the spear points appear across the cloaks of the
Sumerian soldiers.
In the above picture, the enemy symbolically enacts the provocations that
led to the war.
The sudden appearance of the enemy means that the end panels are not
quite so "fanciful".
In the last register, the ram is missing (?) and the tree is flanked with two
images of Anzud, the lion-headed eagle, a symbol of war. He is attacking a
man-headed bull (symbolic of Sumer?).
If one end panel means "war", then the other side can only mean "peace".
The Standard of Ur end panel, “Peace Side”.

which the standard could be attached or removed.
In the top register, there are two flowering plants with the eight-pointed
rosettes, so symbolically important to the Sumerians. At top was probably
a large rosette.
In the middle register, a ram (its horns damaged) is being stalked by a
leopard.

In the bottom register, the ram is seen having escaped the danger.
Before concluding, there is one more topic to be considered.
Which way was the standard carried? With the war side in front, or the
peace side?
I believe the peace side of the standard was in front when in the presence
of Sumerians,
to show the bountiful tribute that the victorious king provides for his
people.
The war side of the standard was in front when in the presence of foreign
dignitaries, whether allies or enemies, to show the dire consequences for
rebellion against the king.
