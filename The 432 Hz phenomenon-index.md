The 432 Hz phenomenon
What is 432 Hz ?
432 Hz is one of the possible ways to tune musical instruments, also
known as the Tuning Note "A" and A=432.
Music tuned to 432 Hz sounds better than contemporary music
which is tuned at A=440.
The famous Stradivarius was tuned to 432 Hz according to the Verdi
tuning
During historical periods when instrumental music rose in
prominence (relative to the voice), there was a continuous tendency
for pitch levels to rise, also known as the pitch inflation.
At the times of Bach, the baroque tuning used A=415 Hz. The
famous Stradivarius was tuned to A=432 Hz according to the Verdi
tuning. Instruments from old civilizations such as the Greeks and
Egyptians were also tuned to A=432 Hz according to



backto432hz.org . Indian instruments also are based on A=432 Hz.
In 1939 Germany and England determined 440 Hz as the frequency
of the musical pitch, after first recommendations in the 19th century,
as production of A=440 instruments already started before
1900.Their effort to standardize this worldwide didn't succeed for
then. But in 1955 at a congres of musicians in London, 440 Hz still
became the international ISO 16-standard. Many protests of (among
others) French musicians, who didn't want 440 Hz as the standard,
didn't help unfortunately.
A higher pitch sounds sharper and more "fresh", but also more
aggressive, which is not a quality audiophiles are looking for.

Geert Huinink, the producer behind DJ Tiësto, has been using the
knowledge of 432 Hz for years, which is probably the secret why his
records are so popular.
How does 432 Hz work?
Based on cymatics research, which is the study of vibrational



patterns that are the result of exposing matter to certain frequencies
(like water or sand), there's a big difference between A=440 and
A=432.
The water sound images of A=432 are more clear with much higher
harmonics, while A=440 just looks like "bad soup". We refer to the
research of Robert Boerman and the video's of Jamie Buturff.

The cohhlea in our inner ear is a water filled spiral, which resonates
naturally to music tuned to A=432 Hz, as the cochlea is based on the
principles of phi-demping. A well known example is the famous B&W
Nautilus speaker (the original one), which spirals are based on the
same principe.



The team behind the 432 EVO organized focus groups which
resulted in 60 trials. In 95% of the trials, our panel found music
retuned to 432 Hz the better version. Listeners are more emotionally
involved, while 440 Hz is a more "mental" experience. Our research
is public, and visitors can look at all the data: more than 60 listening
hours were documented.
Maria Renold came to similar results, with real musical instruments,
and 2000 test candidates! Here's her book:
