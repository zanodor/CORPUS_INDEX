# Index for Tom van Bakel – The sky god An, his wife Uraš, their daughters Nisaba and Ninisina, and their son Enkiare depicted on one cylinder seal.pdf

The sky god An, his wife Uraš,
their daughters Nisaba and Ninisina, and their son Enki
are depicted on one cylinder seal
Dédicace à Anu; Sceau-cylindre du 3/4 du III millénaire (Musée de Damas) Deux temples lui étaient consacrés : l'un à Uruk (Erech dans la Bible et aujourd'hui site appelé Warka) et l'autre à Lagash. Peu figuré, il était souvent représenté par un autel et une tiare ornée de cornes ou par un taureau dont le mugissement pouvait être comparé au grondement du tonnerre. Son nombre était soixante.
In his book “The Seal Cylinders of Western Asia” William Hayes Ward wrote that Anu was half-forgotten:
“It will be observed that here Anu is put before Ashur; but this does not indicate anything more than the formal convention borrowed from Babylonia, which put Anu, though a half-forgotten god, at the head of the pantheon; for at the end of the inscription Ashur comes to his proper precedence: "Ashur, the exalted god, who inhabits Ekharsag-kurkura, Anu, Bel, Ea, and Ishtar, the great gods, the Egigi of heaven, the Annunaki of Earth. " These gods are petitioned to curse anyone who should profane his inscription; and then the king proceeds, after this general malediction, to call on Adad separately to destroy any such enemy with storm, flood, and famine.

And that he was never a familiar god:
“Anu of the Heavens was never a familiar god even among the Babylonians;”.

However, on the above imprint the sky god sits on his wife Uraš, who is depicted as a mountain, and he is surrounded by three children.



Anu seated on Uraš
An or Anu is indicated by the star on top, which is his cuneiform sign:
𒀭 Ur III Sumerian cuneiform for An (and determinative sign for deities; cf. dingir)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anu
He is the divine personification of the sky:
“Anu or An is the divine personification of the sky, supreme God, and ancestor of all the deities in ancient Mesopotamian religion. Anu was believed to be the supreme source of all authority, for the other gods and for all mortal rulers, and he is described in one text as the one "who contains the entire universe". He is identified with the north ecliptic pole centred in the constellation Draco and, along with his sons Enlil and Enki, constitutes the highest divine triad personifying the three bands of constellations of the vault of the sky.”
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anu
And his consort in the earliest Sumerian texts is the goddess Uraš:
“Anu's consort in the earliest Sumerian texts is the goddess Uraš, but she is later the goddess Ki and, in Akkadian texts, the goddess Antu, whose name is a feminine form of Anu.”
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anu



Anu seated on Uraš
Uraš or Urash is a goddess of earth:
“Uraš or Urash, in Sumerian mythology, is a goddess of earth, and one of the consorts of the sky god Anu. She is the mother of the goddess Ninsun and a grandmother of the hero Gilgamesh. However, Uraš may only have been another name for Antum, Anu's wife. The name Uraš even became applied to Anu himself and acquired the meaning "heaven". Ninurta also was apparently called Uraš in later times.”
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uras_(mythology)
And her name even became applied to Anu himself, and acquired the meaning "heaven", and thus, on the above imprint she is indicated by the second star sign.
Moreover, from Sumerian texts, the language used to describe Uraš is very similar to the language used to describe Ninhursag (which means: "lady of the sacred mountain") therefore, the two goddesses may be one and the same.
“From Sumerian texts, the language used to describe Uraš is very similar to the language used to describe Ninhursag. Therefore, the two goddesses may be one and the same. Nisaba is the sister of Ninsun, the mother of Gilgamesh. If Uraš and
Ninhursag are the same goddess, then Nisaba is also the half-sister of Nanshe and (in some versions) Ninurta.”
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nidaba
And thus, she is depicted as a mountain on the above imprint.



Anu seated on Uraš
So, seemingly, An sits on a mountain, but in reality he is seated on his wife:
"I am the lady, the youthful woman, the great strength of Enlil! I am the beautiful woman Ninisina, daughter of holy An! My father An the king, shepherd of the gods, sat me in the Land on a holy dais. My mother Uraš, the lady of the gods, had
momentous sexual intercourse with An, relaxing in the holy bedchamber; my place of engendering by holy An was a holy place."
A šir-gida to Ninisina (Ninisina A): c.4.22.1
And at the same time Uraš had momentous sexual intercourse with him and the two gods engender three children: Nisaba and Ninisina, and Enki.



Dragon Dragon
Uraš is called “a fearsome dragon” and depicted as two dragons at the bottom of the mountain she twice vomits two streams of water:
“My king, you alone perform the ancient rites, a truly immense task. Ninurta, yellow evening light that casts fear over the Land, like holy Uraš, a fearsome dragon brandishing a terrible torch! Ninurta, you alone perform the ancient rites, a truly immense task. Ninurta, yellow evening light that casts fear over the Land, like holy Uraš, a fearsome dragon raising a terrible torch! My king, grandiloquent great warrior, confident in his strength! And may you, Šu-Suen, put your trust in him, in Lord Ninurta. May Šu-Suen, the king whom Enlil has appointed for you, be your constable. Ninurta, grandiloquent great warrior, confident in his strength! And may you, Šu-Suen, put your trust in him, in Lord Ninurta. May Šu-Suen, the king whom Enlil has appointed for you, be your constable. ...... of nir stone, ...... holy and fearsome ......, a truly immense task. Like ...... your august strength, he has written your name on it. ...... will be the guardian of his life forever. Šu-Suen! Holy and fearsome, a truly immense task. Like ...... your august strength, he has written your name on it. ...... will be the guardian of his life forever. (1 line missing)”
A tigi (?) to Ninurta for Šu-Suen (Šu-Suen D): c.2.4.4.4



Nisaba
On the left is Nisaba (her name means: “Grain”), the daughter of An and Uraš.
“Nisaba was the Sumerian goddess of writing, learning, and the harvest. Her sanctuaries were E-zagin at Eresh and at Umma. As with many Sumerian deities, Nisaba's exact place in the pantheon and her heritage appears somewhat ambiguous. She is the daughter of An and Uraš. From Sumerian texts, the language used to describe Uraš is very similar to the language used to describe Ninhursag. Therefore, the two goddess may be one and the same. Nisaba is the sister of Ninsun, the mother of Gilgamesh. If Uraš and Ninhursag are the same goddess, then Nisaba is also the half- sister of Nanshe and (in some versions) Ninurta.”
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nidaba
She is woman born by the mountains and she is a heaper up of grain among the grain piles and in the grain stores!"
“O Nisaba, good woman, fair woman, woman born by the mountains! Nisaba, may you be the butter in the cattle-pen, may you be the cream in the sheepfold, may you be keeper of the seal in the treasury, may you be a good steward in the palace, may you be a heaper up of grain among the grain piles and in the grain stores!"
A hymn to Nisaba (Nisaba A)



Nisaba
She is called: “Lady (Whose) Body (Is) Dappled Barley” and on the imprint a plant grows from her body:
“Surprisingly, the great Sumerian goddess Nissaba, whose name was used in written material to denote “grain,” was the much-valued scribe of the gods. She was the goddess of writing, accounting, and surveying and, more important, patron of scribes and scribal wisdom. Clearly, however, she began as a grain goddess and was remembered as such. Indeed, in written material, she was often identified with the other grain goddesses, especially Ezinu/Ashnan. The grain she embodied was likely barley, for one of her epithets Nunbarshegunu seems to have meant “Lady (Whose) Body (Is) Dappled Barley.” Nonetheless, “she became patroness of scribes sometime soon after the invention of writing,” and her scribal aspects were dominant in the Sumerian schools (Michalowski in Reallexikon IX: 575).”
http://www.matrifocus.com/LAM08/spotlight.htm
In a hymn she appoints a priest to establish bread offerings, but here she may offer bread herself:
“14-20. In order to make barley and flax grow in the furrows, so that excellent corn can be admired; to provide for the seven great throne-daises by making flax shoot forth and making barley shoot forth at the harvest, the great festival of Enlil -- in her great princely role she has cleansed her body and has draped the holy priestly garment on her torso. 21-26. In order to establish bread offerings where none existed, and to pour forth great libations of alcohol, so as to appease the god of grandeur, Enlil, and to appease merciful Kusu and Ezina, she will appoint a great en priest, and will appoint a festival; she will appoint a great en priest of the Land.”
A hymn to Nisaba (Nisaba A)



Ninisina
On the other side of An and Uraš is Ninisina, a goddess with medical skills:
Lady, surpassing with august divine powers, with head high, full of awesomeness, beloved daughter of great An! Ninisina, born of Uraš, from the great womb ...... a great destiny, grandiloquent counsellor of her own father, good stewardess of E-kur! Beautiful ......, glory of the holy throne-dais, merciful, ...... of the black-headed! Holy Ninisina, making everything manifest! My lady, ...... in a white garment and cloak! The impressive course of your outstandingly great deeds, which surpass description, is praised. Your own father ...... holy An has assigned to you supreme divine powers ....... Lady, ...... mercy, who ...... man, who lets ...... stand up (?), you brought ...... from the womb. Your medical skills heal a man, ...... a man. Lady who benefits a man ...... with her incantations, and gives ......! Sores ...... a man's body, her spells ....... A pin at her (?) throat, ...... on her (?) body. Lady, the plant of life ....... The dying man ....... Nintilmud, ...... man ...... shining ....... He is entrusted (?) into the good hands of his god, ......
Her father is An and she is born of Uraš. She is the plant of life and on the imprint this plant may grow from her body.
1 line fragmentary ...... escorts her to ....... She sails on the Euphrates, amid the holy reed-shoots; ....... She moors the boat at Kar-jectina; Enki ....... 19-25. Humbly she ...... Enlil's house. She ...... food offerings ...... of Enlil. She slaughters cattle and sheep ...... Enlil. ...... greets her from his eternal royal offeringplace; ...... his shining ...... upon her. Joyfully .......
Ninisina's journey to Nibru: a cir-namcub to Ninisina (Ninisina C)
According to the myth she sails on the Euphrates and offers food but on the imprint, she is standing on a river and she offers a cedar.



Ninisina
She is linked with the cedar as her house is a fragrant cedar forest:
"My house is the house of Isin, the cosmic border of heaven and earth, a fragrant cedar forest whose perfume does not diminish; its interior is a mountain established in plenteousness. Before the land of Dilmun ever existed, my house was created from a date palm. Before the land of Dilmun ever existed, Isin was created from a date palm. Its dates are like a great linen garment that hangs on a tree, heaped up into piles. The Anuna, the great gods, eat together with me. My house is a place of healing, full of opulence, the place of the formation of the Land. At night it shines to me like the moonlight; in the noonday heat it shines to me like the sunlight.”
A cir-gida to Ninisina (Ninisina A)
Besides that, she uses cedar oil to lubricate her skin:
“Softened with the finest oils, softened with the finest oils -- for her let the finest oils be brought! So that she can be softened with the finest oils, let flowing oil be brought for her. For my beautiful ......, who is luxuriance, for my lady Ninsirsir, Ama-ugukuku, for my lady sitting in wine, for Ninisina sitting in wine, to make the fire blaze in the sky; for my lady bathing like a swallow, let cedar oil and cypress oil, and cedar oil, the aromatic which is beloved of the gods, and cimgig oil, and ...... oil, and holy cow's butter and dairy cow's milk, and ghee brought from the holy cattle-pen and milk brought from (?) the sheepfold, oils wafting up into the heart of heaven like aromatic resins, and ligidba plant oil and white cedar oil -- let them all glisten on her! May she dribble with aromatic cedar resin upon her throat, with white cedar oil on her breasts, with oil on her eyes! Let the finest oils be sprinkled for her! May her neck be made to dribble with aromatic cedar resin! May the finest oils be sprinkled for her on her combed pubic hair and the hair of her head! May the finest oils besprinkle the lustrous nape of her neck as it turns! May the finest oils wash her hands and feet and her rich and fruitful parts! May her limbs and her perfect features lie in the oil! May the woman drip with oil as a cow that has been stood in the water!”
A cir-namcub to Ninisina (Ninisina B)



Enki On the right is Enki, who is the firstborn son of An:
“Enki, lord, firstborn son of An ......, Nudimmud, great bull of the abzu ......, may you ...... with your consort, holy Damgalnuna. Father Enki, may you embrace her and soothe your heart with her. ...... friendly words on behalf of Išme-Dagan. ...... the prayer of the king until distant days. The one blessed by Enlil ......, Išme-Dagan, the shepherd, ...... the son of Enlil. May his radiance ...... for you to the outer limits of heaven and earth. May he have authority, may he be peerless in all the numerous countries. May Išme-Dagan ...... from the south as far as the uplands. ...... the god of the Land ....... May the Tigris and Euphrates ......, may they bring abundance for him. May the udders of heaven open for him; may the harvest ...... for him. May barley, emmer, wheat, gu-nida grain ...... on vast fields for him. May grain heaps be heaped up for him; may Ezina .......”
An adab (?) to Enki for Išme-Dagan (Išme-Dagan D): c.2.5.4.04
With a lance he apparently cursed a river and dammed its opening channel:
“Kazallu, the city of teeming multitudes, was cast into confusion. Numušda took an unfamiliar path away from the city, his beloved dwelling. His wife Namrat, the beautiful lady, was lamenting bitterly." Alas, the destroyed city, my destroyed house," she cried bitterly. Its river bed was empty, no water flowed. Like a river cursed by Enki its opening channel was dammed up. On the fields fine grains grew no more, people had nothing to eat. The orchards were scorched like an oven, its open country was scattered. The four-legged wild animals did not run about. The four-legged creatures of Šakkan could find no rest.”
The lament for Sumer and Urim: c.2.2.3
Or he altered the course of the Tigris and Euphrates:
“After An had frowned upon all the lands, after Enlil had looked favourably on an enemy land, after Nintur had scattered the creatures that she had created, after Enki had altered the course of the Tigris and Euphrates, after Utu had cast his curse on the roads and highways;”
The lament for Sumer and Urim: c.2.2.3



Gemini domicile of d.Anu Gemini April/Mai
This imprint An sitting on Uraš and their children Nisaba, Ninisina and Enki. This scene may demonstrate that the owner of the seal was engendered by his divine father An in June/July and that his divine mother Uraš gave birth to him in April/May.
June/July may be indicated by An sitting on Uraš as this scene may have indicated the domicile of Anu in Cancer. At that time the sun went through this constellation in June/July:
7 The River Crayfish (AL.LUL), domicile (shu-bat d.Anim) of d.Anu. {Cancer}
The 33 Stars on the Path of Enlil from the text from Mul.Apin: Column I, Lines 1-39.
And Enki may indicate April/May as he was the presiding deity of this period:

All in all, the owner of the seal, engendered by An in June/July and given birth by Uraš in April/May, may have been a farmer or a physician.
