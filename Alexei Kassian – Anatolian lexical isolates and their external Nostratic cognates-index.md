Anatolian lexical isolates and their external Nostratic cognates
The author proposes external (Nostratic) etymologies for several dozen Hittite
Luwian roots and auxilliary morphemes lacking Indo-European cognates. The
main part of discussed lexemes belongs to the basic vocabulary.
Bifurcation of the Proto-Indo-European language (Indo-Hittite, using E. Sturtevant’s term) into Anatolian and Narrow Indo-European branches is nowadays accepted by the majority of scholars (see the overview in Blažek 2007).
One of the corollaries of this schema is the fact that roots and stems known only from the Anatolian languages have practically the same chances as Proto-Narrow IE forms to represent Nostratic retentions in Indo-Hittite.1 Below I list ca. 40 Anatolian stems from the basic vocabulary (i.e. Swadesh list, kinship terms, anatomical terms, and so on) which cannot be

Uralic morphosyntactic phenomenon is analyzed.

identified as loans, lack Narrow IE cognates, but have reliable external (Nostratic) parallels.
N o t e s o n t h e t e r m i n o l o g y. 1) The Tower of Babel Project groups Indo-European, Altaic, Uralic, Kartvelian and Dravidian proto-languages into a Eurasiatic macrofamily, provisionally reserving the term Nostratic for the next level, where Eurasiatic is linked to the Afroasiatic (Semito-Hamitic) macrofamily as its closest relative. Since Eurasiatic has not become a common term thus far, in my paper I use the more usual designation of Nostratic as the name of the protolanguage that yielded IE, Altaic, Uralic, Kartvelian and Dravidian protolanguages. The genealogical tree of Nostratic (http://starling.rinet.ru/ images/globet.png), based on 35wor d lists and certain morphological data, shows that the family diverged ca. 10–9 millenium B.C., i.e. in the Mesolithic or Early Neolithic period. 2) The traditional abbreviation IE refers to the Indo-Hittite protolanguage, whereas for the Narrow Indo-European protolanguage I use the term Narrow IE.
The fundamental list of phonetic correspondences between the protolanguages that constitute Nostratic is adduced in Иллич-Свитыч ОСНЯ 1: 147 ff. and Dolgopolsky ND: 9 ff. Compared to Illič-Svityč, Dolgopolsky establishes a number of new correspondences, out of which the most important for us is the loss of Nostratic *z-phonemes in Indo-Hittite, i.e. Nostr. *z/ź/ž > IE * (or IE *H, using Dolgopolsky’s notation). Nostratic data are given in accordance with the Tower of Babel Project databases (unless otherwise mentioned). The following etymological databases were used: Nostratic — Nostret.dbf by S. Starostin (a compilation of Illič-Svityč’s publications and Dolgopolsky ND, plus a number of new comparisons; unfinished work); Indo-European — Piet.dbf by S. Nikolaev; Altaic Altet.dbf (= EDAL with minor corrections); Uralic — Uralet.dbf (= Rédei UEW, plus a number of additions and corrections by various scholars; unfinished work); Kartvelian — Kartet.dbf by S. Starostin (a compilation of Климов ЭСКЯ and Klimov EDKL plus a number of additions); Dravidian — Dravet.dbf by G. Starostin.

Anatolian data are given according to the main lexicographic sources CHD, HEG, HED, EDHIL, Melchert CLL. These dictionaries are usually not mentioned in the entries. Datings of the cuneiform texts are given apud Konkordanz. Narrow IE forms are quoted from the standard dictionaries (LSJ for Ancient Greek; BR and Mayrhoffer EWA for Old Indian; OLD for Latin; and so on) without references.
The list of proposed etymologies is divided into two sections: Reliable (regular phonetic correspondences and self-evident meaning shifts; No. 141) and Dubious (phonetically irregular or semantically distant comparisons; No. 42–55). The entries have the following structure:
Title of the entry: Anatolian data (Hittite forms are not specified). ◊ Virtual (Narrow) IE reconstruction, as can be established on the basis of Anatolian data.2 ≠ Disputable or improbable Narrow IE cognates of the Anatolian form. √ Proposed Nostratic cognates. → Comments & references.
A. Reliable
1. ayimpa, aimpa, impa- c. ‘weight, burden (literal and figurative)’, impai‘to be depressed’. From MS on. Vocalic alternation resembles Ablaut in the noun ayis (nom.-acc) ~ iss- (obl.) ‘mouth’ (to OInd. ās, Lat. ōs ‘mouth’, etc.). ◊ IE **VmPo. ≠ Cf. Grk. ἶπος ‘weight, press’ (Pi., etc.), aor. ἴψασθαι, fut. ἴψεται (Hom.+) ‘to bear down on, oppress’. Puhvel (HED A: 14) proposes borrowing from unknown source both in Hitt. and Grk.
2 *P — any IE labial (*p, *b, *bh); *T — any IE dental (*t, *d, *dh); *K — any IE non-labial
velar (*k/ , *g/ , *gh/ h).
*B — any IE voiced labial (*b, *bh); *D — any IE voiced dental (*d, *dh); *G — any IE
voiced non-labial velar (*g/ , *gh/ h).

Hsch. ἰμφθείς · βλαφθείς, λωβηθείς, νυχθείς ‘oppressed, maltreated’ (if here) is an Asia Minor word. √ Alt. *ámbe ‘heavy, big’: Tung. *amba- ‘big; many; very’; Mong. *amban ‘big, large, heavy; minister, official’; Jpn. * m(p) - ‘heavy’; Kor. *m - ‘heavy’. ? Ural. *umpe ‘whole, complete’: Est. umb, umbes ‘ganz, durchaus, über und über’, Saam. obbâ, obâ, oabâ (N) ‘whole, in its entirety, all; only, rather, pretty’. Perhaps to be separated from the homonymous Uralic stem ‘closed; closed state’. → Consonant correspondences are regular; vocalic correspondences are unclear due to the ambiguity of the Hittite vocalism. See Nostret.dbf #1950 (Alt. + Ural.).
2. *alwanz(a)- ‘witchcraft, sorcery’ in derivates alwanz-adar ‘witchcraft, sorcery’, alwanz-essar ‘witchcraft, sorcery’, alwanz-ahh- ‘to bewitch’, etc. (from OS on). The suffix anza- is not etymologically clear, but attested in a number of Hitt. stems, see Kronasser EHS: 198 ff. ◊ IE **ol o- (~ a) .
≠ E. Rieken and I. Yakubovich (see Yakubovich // Kadmos 47 (2008): 17) connect it to Luwian *aliwanna/i- ‘inimical’ from Indo-Hittite *al o‘other’ (Lat. alius ‘other’, probably Lydian aλa ‘other’) with the Luw. suffix wanna/i. Problematic both phonetically (immotivated loss of i- in Hittite) and semantically (shift ‘enemy’ > ‘witchcraft’ is unprovable). √ Alt. *z ălVbi ‘sorcery, witchcraft; to investigate (by magic power)’: Tung. *silba- ‘to promise, warn, report’; Mong. *silbe, * silmo ‘1 to behave indecently, glance around; 2 devil’; Turk. *jẹlbi- ‘sorcery, witchcraft’; Jpn. *sìrà(m)p- ‘1 to tune, adjust to rhythm, play rhythmical music; 2 to investigate’; Kor. *sj rb- ‘to be annoyed, vexed, sad’. → Correspondences are regular (Nostr. *z > IE ; Nostr. *-w- > Alt. b) . Differently and unlikely Dolgopolsky ND #2661 'sorcery, witchcraft': Alt. + IE *Hel- ‘to destroy’ + Afras.
3. anku adv. ‘fully, quite, really, absolutely, unconditionally’. From MS on. ◊ IE **onKu, **onK - (~ an- ~ ) .
√ Alt. * ŋo ‘right’: Tung. *āŋ(gi)- ‘right’; Mong. *eŋge- ‘1 South; 2 front (of cloth)’; Turk. *oŋ ‘1 right; 2 good, lucky; 3 West’.

4. ekt, ikt- c. ‘(catch)net’, CLuw. akkat(i)- ‘hunting net’ (with the secondary anaptyxis, cf., e.g., Melchert AHP: 277). From MS on. ◊ IE **eKT.
≠ Traditionally analyzed as a t-formation from IE * ēk- ‘to throw’ (Lat. iacīō ‘to throw’), but according to known Hitt. passages, ekt- / akkat(i)- was not a missile, but a hunting net. The connection to West Germ. *jagōn ‘to drive, chase, hunt’ (with highly hypothetical Narrow IE cognates: Proto-Toch. *yokai‘thirst, desire’, OInd. yáhu, yahvá- ‘restless, swift, active’, see Pok.: 502, Adams DTB: 510) is not too apt either. First, a deverbal nomen instrumenti with the suffix t is not a normal morphological pattern; second, the loss of initial * - in Luwian is inexplicable. Cf. also the unclear OInd. form ákṣu ‘net’ (AV+) that can directly correspond to the Hitt. form if we suppose a consonant metathesis in Proto-Indo-Aryan or Proto-Anatolian (the so-called «Brugmann’s fricative»: Hitt. tk ~ OInd. kṣ). √ Ural. *śäktV ‘to plait (e.g., net)’; Alt. *zakt i ‘cushion, mat’ (Tung. *sakta(n) ‘mat’; Turk. *jạŕtuk / *jạtŕuk ‘1 pillow; 2 to prop on a pillow’; Jpn. *sit nia ‘cushion’; Kor. *sàt ‘thin mat’; ? Kartv. *sḳw- ‘to tie (lace, etc.)’: Georg. sḳ(v), Megr. sḳ(u), sḳv, sku, skv, Laz sḳv, skv , Svan le-sḳw-er ‘rope’.
→ Correspondences between IE—Ural.—Alt. are exact. Nostr. *ź > IE is regular. See Nostret.dbf #1542 (Ural. + Alt. + Kartv.).
5. ektu, iktu- c. ‘leg’. MH/NS. ◊ IE **eKTu- or *V KTu.
≠ Traditionally to IE *e -gh- ‘go’ (Lit. eigà ‘a going’, Grk. οἴχομαι ‘to go off’, Toch. B yku ‘gone’) with an additional t-suffix. √ Alt. *z gtu ‘thigh, shank’: Tung. *sigdi-pu ‘metatarsus’; Mong. *se üǯi ‘hip, thigh’; Turk. *jo(g)ta ‘1 thigh, shank; 2 body, stature’. → Correspondences are exact. Nostr. *z > IE is regular. Hittite stem was correctly etymologized in Dolgopolsky ND #2661 (Hitt. + Alt. + Afras.). On the other hand, Nostret.dbf #913 unites Alt. with IE *soK t-: Hitt. sagutta- ‘thigh, hip (vel sim.)’, OInd. sákthi n. (heteroclitic: obliques in n) ‘thigh, thigh-bone’, Avest. haxti- ‘thigh’, maybe Slav. *stegno



Anatolian lexical isolates and their external Nostratic cognates 157
‘thigh, ham’ if < *sedgn- < *setk-n- < *sekt- (see Nikolaev, Piet.dbf #3022 with incorrect IE reconstruction, without Hittite, but with a dubious Toch. B cognate). Apparently IE *soK t- contains the tsuffix (the same as, e.g., in *neK -t- ‘night’) and the starting IndoHittite root was *soK . 3
6. istam-ass-mi ‘to hear’, istam-ana-/istam-ina- ‘ear’ (from OS on), CLuw. tumm-ant- ‘ear’.
◊ IE **stom- (~ a) .4 Hitt. st- ~ CLuw. t- may points to IE “s-mobile”. CLuw. u < a probably under the influence of labial m. ≠ Traditionally united with Grk. στόμα(τ) ‘mouth’ (further to Avest. staman- ‘maw’) as ‘an organ of perception’ that is semantically unsatisfactory (the same concerns ‘a hole in the head’ as an invariant meaning). √ Kartv. *śtVm- ‘ear’, based on Svan šdim, šṭim ‘ear’ and probably on *(s)a-(s)tum-al- or *(s)a-(s)tu-n-al- ‘head of the bed’5: Georg. sastumal- ‘head of the bed’, Megr. ortumel- ‘head of the bed’, Laz omtunal- [< ontumal-] ‘bearing log of the fire’ (Klimov EDKL: 175). Svan i- in šdim can be explained as paradigmatic levelling after the nominative form with i-assimilation *šdum-i > *šdüm- > šdim. The retention of ST-onset in Georg. stumal- is unclear. Cf. also forms with n, not m, quoted in Климов ЭСКЯ: 170. Alternatively *(s)a-(s)tu-n-al- can go back to Kartv. *(ś)taw- ‘head’. → Anatolian root was correctly etymologized in Dolgopolsky ND #2133 *sVTimV ‘to hear’: Hitt. + Kartv. + Egypt. (sḏm ‘to hear’, if ḏ < *Ty??) and some other Afras.
7. yaya hi ‘to expectorate (phlegm)’. Scarce attestation in medical NS texts. For the meaning of the term see Kassian forthcoming. ◊ IE ** o - (~ a) . √ Alt. *n ji ‘pus; snot’: PTung. *ńā- ‘1 to rot; 2 pus’; PMong. *nij‘1 snot; 2 to blow nose’.
3 For which cf. Alt. *sajk V ‘knucklebone’: Tung. *sajKa ‘knucklebone’; Turk. *siaka
‘shin-bone’
4 For Hittite orthographic iš-ta, covering phonetic /st-/, see Kassian & Yakubovich 2002.
5 If < ‘pillow’; cf. Russian под-ушка ‘pillow’, lit. ‘under-ear’.



158 Alexei Kassian
Drav. *nej- ‘oil, ghee’: South *nej- ‘butter, ghee, oil, grease, fat, honey’; Telugu *nej- ‘ghee, oil’; Kolami-Gadba *nej ‘oil, ghee’; Gondi-Kui *nij ‘oil, ghee’. The primary anatomic meaning is preserved in the compound with *tōr- ‘to flow’ — Drav. *nej-tor ‘blood’: South *nej-t r; Telugu *nettur-; Kolami-Gadba *netur; Gondi-Kui *nej-tor; Brahui ditar. → Nostr. *ń- > IE * - ~ Alt. *n - ~ Drav. n- is regular. Cf. Nostret.dbf #1046 (Alt. + Drav. + dubious IE *la - ‘fat’ + phonetically unsatisfactory Kartv. *la w- ‘fig’).
8. haruwa- ‘road’, rare word (MH/NS), can be a Luwism. HLuw. harwa‘road’, harwa-ni- ‘to send, dispatch’. ◊ IE **Horu- (~ a) or **H . If the Hitt. stem is a Luwian loan, then theoretically it can correspond to IE **HorK - (with *k /g /gh > ). √ Drav. *ār- (*-ḏ) (South only: *ār) ‘way, road, path’. Kartv. *xer- ‘to lead, to make way’: Georg. m-xer-v-al- ‘leading’, sa-xer-v-el- ‘rudder, steering oar’, Megr. xar- ‘to make way in the snow’, Laz xar- ‘step’. → Anatolian *h- ~ Kartv. *x- ~ Drav. is regular. Drav. *r, however, points to the Nostratic front vowel in the second syllable. Cf. also a similar root in u-: Ural. *ura ‘way, path’, Drav. *vaṛ- ‘road’, *o -uŋk- ‘lane, path’ (Nostret.dbf #1205, plus Alt.).
9. kam(m)ars-mi ‘to defecate (said of human and animal)’, kammaraš-niya‘to befoul(?)’, kamars-uwant- c. ‘defecation’. From MS on. ◊ IE **Kom... (~ a) . ≠ Traditionally the Hitt. stem is analyzed as *kad-mar-s, i.e. IE * hod(Grk. χέζω, OInd. hádati ‘to defecate’, etc.) + heteroclitic suffix mar, well-attested in Hitt. + additional s-suffix. This supposition is based on three facts: 1) double mm- pointing to an old cluster (*-Tm- or *-mn) ; 2) direct morphological parallel in Toch. B kenmer ‘excrement’ (< * hod-mor) and
3) unique Luwoid form with the retained cluster: prs. 3 pl. katmarsitti. As a matter of fact, the doubled mm- is attested only twice (iter. 3 pl. imp. kammarseskiddu in LNS KUB 17.27 and suffixed stem k]ammarasniyattat in broken MS? KBo 38.188), the standard orthography is



Anatolian lexical isolates and their external Nostratic cognates 159
m- (from MS on). Furthermore, Toch. B kenmer does not exist (pit=kenmer is to be read pitke-enmer ‘spittle’ + ‘(a medical ingredient)’, see Adams DTB: 193). As for Luwoid katmarsitti, the translation ‘they defecate’ is quite improbable for the ritual context KUB 30.31 1–8; we must accept that the meaning of this word remains unknown, see CHD, Š: 47 (supported by Rieken // HS 116 (2003): 308). Postulation of the Anatolian root *kam- ‘dung’ is therefore plausible; the second element of the Hitt. stem ( ars) is not clear, it can be a double-suffixal formation (e.g., heteroclitic ar and denominative s- as in istam-a()ss- ‘to hear’). In any case, Puhvel’s suppositions about compound {kad-mar} + verbs sai-/siya- ‘to press’ or suwai- ‘to fill’ seem improbable. √ Alt. *k amo ‘dung, faeces’: Tung. *[x]amū- ‘1 faeces, dung; 2 to defecate; 3 snuff, thief (in a pipe)’; Mong. *komu- ‘horse dung’; Turk. *Kom- ‘1 horse dung; 2 sheep dung balls; 3 round, spheroid’.
10. kappuwai-mi ‘to count, tally, calculate; to take into account’ (from OS on). The Hitt. verb is a transparent denominative formation from an unattested u stem *kappu. The meaning ‘to tally’ is primary, since the semantic shift ‘to tally’ > ‘to take into account, etc.’ is well attested in the world languages, but probably not vice versa. ◊ IE **Kopu- (~ a) . ≠ Similarity with Lat. com-putāre ‘to calculate’ (cf. putāre ‘to make clean or tidy, prune’, probably from paviō ‘to thump, pound’) provokes some Indo-Europeanists to invest in risky etymological theories: Hitt. kappuwai- is analyzed as the Hitt. verb puwai- ‘to pound, grind (a medical ingredient)’ (can be a Luwian loan; a cognate of Lat. paviō) with non-existent Anatolian adverbs/preverbs *kam- or *kat. However, it is clear that Lat. com-putāre is derived not from the terminus technicus putāre ‘to prune, cut back (trees, bushes); to scour (wool), etc.’, but from the homonymous putāre ‘to think, suppose; to consider, regard’ (with the cross-linguistically well attested meaning shift ‘to think’ > ‘to calculate’); therefore, the Hitt. verb puwai- ‘to grind’ as a hypothetical base of kappuwai- is out of play.6
6 Inner Hittite formal difficulties are hardly easier to overcome. The assumed compound
*kam-puwai- should be ruled out with certainty, since there are no adverbial counterparts of



160 Alexei Kassian
Alternatively Nikolaev (Piet.dbf #1629) connects kappuwai- to Slav. *zob-/žeb- [Rus. заб-ота ‘concern (for); care (for)’, etc.], Balt. *geb[Lith. gebti ‘pflegen, gewohnt sein, vermögen’, gebùs ‘fleissig, begabt’], Germ. *kōpjan- ‘to stare, to gape; to observe’ [Orel HGE: 219], *kapēn- [OHG kapfēn ‘schauen, spähen’; Köbler GWb s.v. *kapp-]. This comparison is phonetically unsatisfactory, since Hitt. points to IE *-p, BSlav. — to IE *-bh, Germ. — to IE *b. √ Alt. *k èpù ‘price; to transform(?)’: Mong. *kubil- ‘to transform, take another form’ [if here!]; Turk. *Kẹbi-ĺč- ‘1 a gift of food to someone who comes to stack the crop after the fields are clear; 2 harvest tax in favour of the poor or the clergy; 3 debt’; Jpn. *kupua- ‘profit’; Kor. *káps ‘price’. Drav. *kap- ‘tribute’: South *kap-am ‘tribute’, Telugu *kapp- ‘tribute, tax, subsidy’. → Correspondences are regular. Apparently we deal with the Nostratic nominal stem *ḳVpu ‘number’ or ‘count’ with natural meaning shifts to ‘price’ (Alt.) and ‘tribute’ (Drav.). Altaic verbal stem *k ápa ‘to buy, pay back’ [Tung. *xab- ‘1 to buy; 2 to complain, start a lawsuit’; Jpn. *káp- ‘to buy, (ex)change’; Kor. *kàph1- ‘to compensate, pay back’] cannot be separated from this cluster (semantic shift ‘count’ > ‘recount’ > ‘pay’ is the same as, e.g., in OHG zalōn ‘to count’ > NHG zahlen). Cf. also extremely dubious IE *ka( )p- ‘merchant’: Grk. κάπηλος [ᾰ] (Hdt., Plato, etc.) ‘retail-dealer, huckster, tavern-keeper’, Lat. caupō / cōpō, ōnis (Plautus, Horatius, etc.) ‘shop-keeper, tavern-keeper’, cōpa f. ‘woman who provides entertainment in taverns’. Seems to be a Wanderwort of unclear nature with irregular phonetic correspondences. See Nostret.dbf #1032 (Alt. + Drav. + dubious IE ‘merchant’).
IE * om- ‘with’ in Anatolian languages, not to mention that the cluster mP- is retained in
Hittite. As for the proposed *kat-puwai, the adverbs katta and katti ‘down, above’ (= Grk.
κάτα, κατά) are already known from the most ancient Hittite texts, but the variant kat- is
unattested elsewhere, leaving the compound *kat-puwai- without any reliable parallels
within the Hittite morphological system (the simplification *TP- > PP- in Proto-Hittite is
also a mere guess without proof; synchronically TP-clusters were possible at least in bor
rowed words, cf. such divine names as katpazzizzi, putpar and toponyms kutpina, hutpa, kutpa).



Anatolian lexical isolates and their external Nostratic cognates 161
11. karuss-iya-mi ‘to be/fall silent; to keep quiet (about)’. From MS on. ◊ IE **Kor... (~ ar- ~ ) .
≠ Traditionally united with Hitt. kariya- ‘to stop, pause (intr.)’: semantically possible, but the morphological pattern of derivation is quite unclear. Eichner’s comparison with Balto-Slav.-Germ. onomatopoeic root *(s)kre st- (Germ. *kreustanan ‘to gnash teeth’, Latv. skraustêt ‘to crackle’, Slav. *xrustěti ‘to crackle’) is improbable. √ Kartv. * urs- ‘to be silent, become silent’: Georg. 3urs, Megr. 'urs. → Correctly etymologized in Dolgopolsky ND #1942 (Hitt. + Kartv. + Afras.).
12. kasa ‘look here, lo, behold’ (see Hoffner & Melchert: 323 f. for the nuances of the English translation). From OS on. Hitt. kasa can be a fossilized imv. 3 sg. from an unattested verbal hi-stem. ◊ IE **Kos- (~ a) . ≠ Traditionally kasa is derived from the pronominal stem *ka- ‘this’ (< IE *5e/o/i) after an unclear morphological pattern. √ Ural. *kaće ‘to see, look, notice’. → Correspondences are regular. Further cf. probably Alt. *káče ‘wish, intent’ (so Nostret.dbf #1706: Ural. + Alt.).
13. kist, kest- ‘to be extinguished, die out’, causative kis(ta)nu. Palaic kist‘id.’. From OS on.
◊ IE **KV st- or **Kest- (~ zd) .
≠ Traditionally to IE *gwes-: OInd. jásate ‘to be exhausted’, Rus. гаснуть, etc. Hittite, however, must show ku- for IE *g , whereas t-suffixation is unlikely for this primary verbal stem. Further cf. Hitt. kast- (in derivates: kist) ‘hunger’ and Toch. A kaṣt, B kest ‘hunger, famine’. √ Alt. *kíǯV ‘to lose, disappear’: Tung. *kiǯ- ‘to lose’; Jpn. *kíjá- ‘to disappear, be extinguished’. → Note Alt. *-ǯ- ~ Anatolian *-st. Also cf. Drav. *kˆeḍ- ‘to perish’ and (tentatively proposed in Nostret.dbf #1945) Ural. *käčke ‘to hide’.
14. kudur n. r-st. ‘leg/shank (of animal: beef, lamb etc.)’, only? in “culinary” contexts. From OH/NS on.



162 Alexei Kassian
◊ IE **KuD, **KV D- or **K VD. Morphological analysis kud-ur is plausible. ≠ M. Poetto (supported by HED) adduces a parallel with ONorse kvett ‘meat’, Icel. kvetti ‘Fleischstück vom Wal’ (de Vries ANEW: 337), possibly a t-formation from the highly unclear Germ. root *kut- ‘to cut’, violating IE phonotactics (i.e. ‘meat’ as ‘cut off’): Faroese kvetta ‘hastig abschneiden’, Swed. and Icel. kuta ‘to cut with a knife’, Swed. kuta, Icel. kuti ‘knife’, MEng. cutten ‘to cut’ (North Germ. loan?). On the other hand, ON kvett is very similar to ON kjǫt ‘meat’; the former originates from some virtual IE stem like *ged o (violating IE phonotactics), and kvett may go back to the same Germ. stem with -metathesis. Cf. also inherited OFrench couteau ‘knife’ (source of borrowing?). Thus the (North) Germanic root ‘to cut’ remains problematic; it can hardly reflect Proto-IE in view of the Germ. sequence *k-t, and the semantic shift ‘to cut’ > ‘meat’ > ‘animal leg’ requires typological evidence as well.7 √ Drav. *kuḏuŋ- ‘thigh’ (South *kUr-aŋ- ‘thigh’, Telugu *kuruv- ‘thigh’, Kolami-Gadba *kuḏg- ‘thigh’, Gondi-Kui *kuḏg- ‘thigh’, North *qosg-ā ‘thigh’). → Correspondences are regular. Further cf. the well-known Nostr. root ḳudV- ‘tail’ (Nostret.dbf #595): IE (Lat.) *kaud, Alt. *k údo(rgV), Kartv. *ḳwad, maybe Ural. *kuttV ‘back’.
15. kuwattar / kuttar n. r/n-st. (obl.: kuttan) ‘nape of the neck, scruff, top of shoulders; mainstay, support’ (from OS on), kuttan-iya- ‘herrisch behandeln’ (MS), kuttan-alli ‘necklace’ (NS). Puhvel (HED) translates kuttar in the entry title as ‘strength, force, power’, but in the quoted passages gives the correct translation ‘mainstay’. Derived verb kuttan-iyameans something like ‘herrisch behandeln’ (rather than ‘to exert power’ as per Puhvel).8 Anatomical semantics is apparently primary. ◊ IE **K ot- or *K ot- - (~ a) .
7 Lat. carn- ‘meat’, quoted in HED, goes back to IE *kar n- ‘meat’ (Germ. *xarun-d-a-n
‘skin, body, flesh’), its connection with IE *(s)ker - ‘to cut’ is hypothetical (derivation from IE
*(s)ker - ‘bark, skin’ is more probable in any case).
8 Semantic shift resembles @r<[o-hveq. (Exodus 33:3) ‘σκληρο-τράχηλος, stiff-necked’, etc.



Anatolian lexical isolates and their external Nostratic cognates 163
≠ Puhvel, departing from the meaning ‘power’, connects this to IE *5e -/ *5 ā- ‘schwellen’ (Pok.: 592 ff.), cf. especially OInd. (RV) śvā-trá‘strong; strength’. Morphological issues, however, are not any less problematic than semantic ones, since the well-attested Hittite abstract heteroclitic suffix adar has voiced d, not voiceless tt- and oblique form in nn- (< *-dn) , not ttan. Thus kuwattar / kuttar must be treated as a primary heteroclitic stem: kuwatt-ar. An interesting parallel is Lat. guttur ‘throat’ (certainly not inherited < Italic). √ Drav. *kut- ‘1 throat; 2 neck’ (South *kut- ‘neck, throat’; Telugu *kut-ik‘throat’; Gondi-Kui *kut- ‘neck, throat’). → Correspondences are regular. Semantic shift ‘neck’ > ‘nape of the neck’ is possible, but probably not vice versa. Further cf. ‘stomach’ in Nostret.dbf #1311: IE *gwet- ‘stomach, abdomen, womb’ (Toch., Germ., dubious Lat.), Alt. *g odV ‘belly, stomach’, Ural. *kütV ‘middle, inside, interval’. However, the semantic shift ‘throat’ > ‘stomach’ or vice versa requires typological evidence.
16. le ‘don’t (prohibitive, strong negative, usually expressing wish or command)’. Hitt. le is translated as Akkad. la; opposed to Hitt. natta ‘not (negative of assertion)’ = Akkad. ul. ◊ IE **le or *lV .
≠ Connection with IE *ne or *mē is phonetically impossible. For want of better ideas, some scholars assume that le originated from IndoHittite *ne via “nasal dissimilation” in the construction ne=man > le=man (‘don’t’ + optative particle man), after which le spread into other syntactical positions — highly unlikely, since, according to known Hittite texts, le=man is not at all a predominating construction with le (see CHD L–N); also, “nasal dissimilation” is only a very occasional phonetic phenomenon in Hittite.9
9 Katz 2005, in an attempt to confirm his original etymological solution for Hitt.
lahhanza, claims that the dissimilative process *n—N > l—N was regular in Proto-Hittite. Be
sides le ‘don’t’, he adduces three further examples that show Hitt. l instead of expected n:
1) lah(h)anza ‘a k. of duck’ ~ suffixal formation from IE *snā- [*sneH-] ‘to swim, to wash one
self’, with unexpected “s-mobile”, i.e. ‘duck’ as ‘swimming’; 2) laman ‘name’ ~ IE *nōm
‘name’; 3) lammar, gen. lamnas ‘a small unit of time, moment; instantly, immediately’ ~ Lat.

√ Ural. *älä / *ala ‘don’t (prohibitive)’. Drav. *al- ‘negative morpheme (negative of assertion)’. → See Dolgopolsky ND #22, #1342 and Nostret.dbf #1193. Well-known comparison, accepted even by some Indo-Europeanists. Further to Sem. *ʔal ‘don’t; not’ and Sem. *lā/laʔ ‘don’t; not’ (see Dolgopolsky with Cushitic data). The primary shape was probably *la (Sem., Hitt.), extended by *a- (Drav., Ural.), and then by * - (Sem., Ural., Alt.).
17. mai-/miya-hi ‘to grow, ripen (act.); to be born (med.)’ (well-attested from OS on), may-ant- ‘adult; young male; mighty male’, and other derivates. Palaic may-ant- ‘adult male’. HLuw. *may- ‘to grow’ in derivates. ◊ IE **mō( )- or **mā( ).
≠ Hardly to IE *mē( )- ‘to measure’ because of semantic difficulties. Lat. mātūrus ‘ripe (of fruit); fully grown, adult (of person); having gone full term, fully developed (of foetus)’ should be considered a hidden cognate, since its meaning exactly matches Hitt. verb. √ Drav. *mā(j)- ‘great’: South *mā- ‘great, big’, Gondi-Kui *māj- ‘big’.
18. miyu-/meyu- ‘4, four’, CLuw. mawa- ‘4, four’. From MS on. ◊ IE **me u.
nŭmerus ‘number’. Puhvel (HED L: 50) adds a fourth case: 4) lam- ‘to be mixed together’ (if
the reading is correct!) ~ IE *nem- ‘zuteilen; nehmen’ (Pok.: 763 f.). Two of these etymologies
(lah(h)anza and lam) are rather weak and, therefore, cannot prove any unconventional pho
netic laws. The comparison laman ~ *nōm is indisputable, but related forms in other
Nostratic branches show the same l/n-alternation (Alt. *ĺ mo(ŋa) ‘name; spell, divination’
and Ural. *lime ‘name’ alongside the variant *nime), therefore, an equivalent solution would
be to assume Indo-Hittite *lōm , assimilating to *nōm in Narrow IE (as well as some Uralic
branches). As for lammar, this stem is derived from an Anatolian root like *lam- or *laT- (cf.
doubled mm) with the heteroclitic suffix mar; root (!) connection to Lat. nŭmerus is indeed
plausible, therefore, occasional nasal dissimilation n-m > l-m can be accepted for this Hitt.
stem. Of course, Hittite has a great number of stems and morphemes where the sequence
n—N is retained, both inherited and borrowed. E.g., namma ‘then’, nekna- ‘brother’, causative
infix nin, prt. 1 sg. ending nun, and so forth. For each of these “exceptions” Katz equi
libristically proposes individual rules that prevent the words from following his dissimila
tive law. I suppose that there is no additional need to discuss the faultiness of this meth
odological approach.

√ Alt. *móju ‘all (totus), whole’: Tung. *muja- ‘whole, all (totus)’, Jap. *múina ‘all (totus), all (omnis)’, Kor. *măin ‘most, extremely, very’. → Nostratic counting systems consisted of three members: “1, 2, >2/several/many”. Indo-Hittite expanded it to “1, 2, 3, >3/several/many”. For the next newly formed numeral, *meyu- ‘4’, Anatolian used the Nostratic stem that yielded Proto-Altaic *móju ‘all (totus)’. For details and typological discussion see Kassian 2009. Correspondences are regular (except for the secondary Indo-Hittite *o/e apophony).
19. nega, niga- c. ‘sister’ (from OH/MS on), nek-na- c. ‘brother’ (OS hapax?). Also in compounds, e.g., pappa-nega- ‘fraternal sister’, etc. The element niga is also encountered in a number of Cappadocian female names. Cf. also Lallworts with the shape NANA: CLuw. nani(ya)- (adj.) ‘of a brother’, HLuw. nana-sri- ‘sister’ (+ sri ‘woman’), Lyc. A nẽne/i- ‘brother’, which theoretically can originate from the same Anat. *neG-na- ‘brother’. ◊ IE **neGo- or **nV Go.
≠ G. Neumann (supported by HED) compares nekna- ‘brother’ with Ogham ini-gena, OIrish in-gen ‘daughter; girl’, Grk. ἔγ-γονος ‘grandson; descendant’, ἐγ-γόνη ‘grand-daughter’, literally ‘inborn’ (IE *en(i) + * en ) . This folk etymology does not explain the morphology of Hitt. nekna- ‘brother’, not to mention the fact that the internal Hittite analysis points to nega- ‘sister’ as a basic stem, while nekna- is a secondary suffixal formation.10 √ Drav. *nāg- ‘(young) female’: (South *nāg- ‘young female’, Telugu *nāg- ‘damsel’, Kolami-Gadba *Nāg-v- ‘female pig’). → Drav. *-g- points to IE *-gh. Correctly etymologized in Dolgopolsky ND #1538a (Hitt. + Drav. + Afras.).
10 Cf., e.g., pes(e)na- ‘man’ : IE pes- ‘penis’; isna- ‘dough’ (MS, later issana-/essana) : IE
* es- (OHG jes-an ‘to ferment’), etc. For the infrequent derivation ‘sister’ > ‘brother’ cf., e.g.,
Proto-Turkic *siŋil ‘younger sister’ (in a number of languages: OTurk. siŋil, Karakh. siŋil,
Turkm. siŋli, etc.), but in two languages with the *m-suffix: Chulym Shor siŋn-im ‘younger
brother’, Chuvash šъll-ъm ‘younger brother’ (EDAL: 1224 f.).

Cf. Alt. *nek V ‘friend, younger relative’, although the correspondence Alt. *-k ̔- vs. Drav. g, IE *-g-/-gh- seems irregular (as a separate root in Dolgopolsky ND #1546: Alt. + Afras. + dubious IE). Cf. also Alt. *ń ṑgè ‘son-in-law, nephew’. To be separated from Alt. *n ŋu ‘female relative (sister or brother’s wife)’ ~ Ural. *ńiŋV ‘female’ ~ IE * enH-ter- / * H-ter- ‘die Frau des Bruders des Gatten’ ~ Drav. *nānḏ- ‘female relative’.
20. nink-mi ‘to soak up, be saturated; to get drunk’ (from OS? and MS on), causative ninka-nu- ‘to soak, drench; to make drunk’. ◊ IE **nenK- (~ i- ~ V ) .
≠ Apparently not to Hitt. ninink- (*nik- with nin-infix) ‘to set in motion’, Lith. su-nìkti, su-ninkù ‘to go at, assail, apply oneself to’, Slav. *-niknǫti, as per Puhvel, who assumes the “alcoholic” meaning to be primary(!). √ Drav. *ninḏ- ‘to be full’: South *nIṟ-ai, * ninṟ- ‘to be full’, Telugu *neṟ/*ninḍ- ‘to become full, be fulfilled or accomplished’, KolamiGadba *ninḍ- (*-nḏ) ‘to be full’, Gondi-Kui * ninḏ- ‘to be filled’, North *nind- ‘to fill’. → Drav. cluster *-nḏ- seems to be one of the possible reflexes of Nostr. *nK- (*-ŋ) , cf. the well-known comparison: Alt. *n ŋu ‘female relative (sister or brother’s wife)’ ~ Ural. *ńiŋV ‘female’ ~ IE * enHter- ‘die Frau des Bruders des Gatten’ ~ Drav. *nānḏ- ‘female relative’.11 Also cf. forms without the nasal: Alt. *nìk é ‘to become sour, ripen’: Tung. *ńeK- ~ *niK- ‘to rot, become sour (of food)’; Mong. *negsi‘to rot, become sour’; Jpn. *nìnkà- ‘bitter, sour’; Kor. *nìk- ‘to be boiled, ripen’. The Altaic root matches Hitt. and Drav. data semantically, but loss of nasality is unmotivated.
21. pak-nu-mi ‘to defame, slander, denounce’. Rare verb, OH/NS. Clear causative in nu- with a-grade. ◊ IE **PeK- (~ o- ~ a) .
11 Further Alt. *ńéŋńi ‘East or South (wind), warm season’ ~ Drav. *ńēinḏ- ‘day’
(Nostret.dbf #1054).

√ Alt. *pek a ‘to be confused, embarrassed’: Tung. *peku- ‘to be confused, annoyed, to feel shy’; Mong. *bakar-da- ‘to be anxious, confused’. → Correspondences are regular.
22. palwa- c. ‘vesicle, water blister’ or rather ‘watery fluid of blister’. Known from NH lexical list, matching Akkad. bubuOtu ‘vesicle, water blister’12. Since the vocabulary allots palwas together with eshar ‘blood’ and manis ‘pus’ in a separate lexical section (bodily fluids?), it seems that palwa- means ‘watery or serous fluid of blister’ rather than ‘water blister’ itself.
◊ IE **Pol o- (~ a) .
≠ Possibly, but not obligatory to Lat. palūd- ‘bog, pool’, OInd. palvalá‘pool’. Cf. also Puhvel’s construction (HED M: 196), based on the incorrect reading mu-wa- (instead of pal-wa) and the incorrect meaning ‘sperm’. √ Alt. *b ùjlu (~ i) ‘blood’: Tung. *boldu- ‘pulse’; Mong. *bülüŋ ‘blood clot’; Kor. *píh ‘blood’ → Correspondences are regular. The diphthong is simplified in IndoHittite according to general phonotactical rules (*o l > *ol ).
23. pankur n. r/n-st. ‘udder, teat’. Hitt. pank-ur designates an external body part of a mammal; according to known contexts, translation ‘udder, teat’ seems to be the only sensible variant. Secondary meaning ‘milk’ or ‘foremilk’ is also very plausible for some ritual passages. ◊ IE **PonK- (~ an- ~ ) .
≠ Certainly to be separated from the homographic pankur ‘group of related animals or persons; clan’. √ Ural. *poŋe(sV) ‘breast, bosom’. → Correspondences are regular. Further cf. Alt. *p òme ‘breast, part of breast’ and Drav. *pom- ‘to embrace’ (Nostret.dbf #1068).
24. puss-mi ‘to be (partly) eclipsed’. The verb describes an unfavorable astronomic omen, related to the position of the sun and the moon (“the king will die”, “the land will become small”, etc.). The only reasonable

Cf. semantically very doubtful Ural. *pise ‘to remain, be stuck’ (proposed in Nostret.dbf #1502).
25. sarhuwant- c. ‘internal organs, intestines, womb; foetus’. From OS on. Morphologically can be analyzed as sarhu-ant- or sarh-want. ◊ IE **sorH - (~ ar- ~ ) .
≠ Cf. Arm. argand ‘venter, uterus’ (< IE *s Hw t?? or rather a loan) and Toch. AB sāry ‘Samen’. Cf. also Grk. ὀρύα (name of a play of Epicharmus), ὀρoύα (Hsch.) ‘sausage’, hardly inherited. √ Kartv. * ar w- ‘sinew’: Georg. ʒar v, Megrel ǯer w, Svan ǯär w. → A good 4consonant stem with r egular phonetic correspondences (for Kart. alternatively and not likely cf. Dolgopolsky ND #2802 with doubtful Ural. and Afras. cognates). The meaning shift ‘gut’ < > ‘intestines’ is trivial. The semantic development ‘sinew’ < > ‘gut’ is more interesting; it can be illustrated, e.g., by Semitic data: Harari wWtär ‘nerve, vein, gut, sinew’ from Semitic *wat(a)r- ‘tendon’ (SED 1: #290); in the contrary direction: Ugar. ksl ‘lomo, espalda; tendón, nervio; lado, sector’ from Semitic *kVs(V)l- ‘(area between) loins and genitals’ (SED 1: #111).
26. sasa- c. ‘(a wild member of the goat family)’, ‘antelope (vel sim.)’. From OH/MS on.
◊ IE **soso- (~ a-o) .
≠ Certainly not to OInd. śaśá- ‘hase’ < IE *5aso- ‘grey’. √ Alt. *sési ‘deer, wild animal’: Tung. *sesi-n ‘herd (of deer, wild animals)’; Turk. *sạs-na ‘pig’ (??); Jpn. *sisi ‘deer’; Kor. *sàsắm ‘deer’. Ural. *ćačV ‘herd’ → Correspondences are regular. Nostret.dbf #1682 (Alt. + Ural.)

27. sēr adv./preverb/postpos. ‘above, over’, adv./prev./postpos. sarā ‘up, upwards; above, on top’. From OS on. CLuw. sarra ‘(up)on; thereon’, sarri ‘above; up’. Internal reconstruction points to Anatolian nominal consonantal stem *ser ‘top’ with e/ Ablaut (ser is nominative or “suffix-less locative”, sara is fossilized allative, sarri is locative). ◊ IE **ser, **sr-/sъr.
≠ Comparison with Grk. ῥίον [ῐ] ‘any jutting part of a mountain, whether upwards or forwards: peak, headland’ (both meanings from Hom. on) is possible, if ‘peak’ is the primary meaning. Attempts to separate Grk. ῥίον into two lexemes — ‘peak’ and ‘headland’ — with different etymologies are not plausible. √ Alt. *sira (~ u) ‘hill, high mountain’: Tung. *sirk- ‘1 a small hillock; 2 cape’; Mong. *siru- / *siro- ‘1 rock, cliff; 2 high mountain’; Turk. *sYrt ‘1 back, spine (of animal); 2 tableland, mountain ridge’. ? Ural. *śarma ‘hole in tent roof’, very dubious. More promising is the comparison with Mordvinian forms: E seŕ(e), M śeŕ ‘Höhe; Wuchs, Statur’, E seŕej, seŕev, seŕeŋ, särij, M śeŕi ‘hoch, tief’ (Rédei UEW: 761). Kartv. *ser- ‘hill’: Georg. ser- ‘hill’ (Чубинашвили), Laz sirt- ‘hill’ (Климов—Халилов), not included in Klimov EDKL. → Correspondences are regular. Correctly etymologized in Dolgopolsky ND #2104a (IE + Ural. *śarma + Kartv. + Afras.) and Nostret.dbf #1555 (IE + Alt. + Ural. *śarma? + Kartv.).
28. sissur n. r-st. ‘irrigation’ (from OH/NS on), denominative sissur-iya- ‘to supply with water, irrigate’ (from MS on; a secondary root variant is found in the iterative form with sk-: sissiur-i-ske) . Morphological analysis siss-ur is plausible (+ deverbal suffix ur). ◊ IE **sV s- or **ses.
≠ Traditionally analyzed as a reduplication (si/e-sur) of the root sur, further to IE *sur-/so r- ‘sour’ — perhaps possible morphologically, but not very convincing semantically. Other proposed connections (IE *se - ‘tröpfeln’ [Pok.: 889] or IE *seso-/*sas o- ‘Feldfrucht’ [Pok.: 880]) are also vague, either phonetically or semantically. √ Ural. *śäčä ‘flood, high water level in lakes/rivers’ (Finno-Ugric): Saam. čacce āʒ- ‘water; level of water in a river or lake’, Khanty seč ‘Steigen, Zunahme des Wassers, Überschwemmung’.

→ Correspondences are regular. Cf. Dolgopolsky ND #2016 *Saču/*śäču ‘to scatter, spread about, pour’: Afras. + Alt. *šéčo ‘to scatter, pour out’ + Ural. (Ob.-Ug.) *čačV- ‘to pour out, sweep’ or *śäčä ‘flood’ + IE (incorrect Hitt. ‘to filter; sieve’). In all likelihood, these are several different roots. In any case it is clear that Hitt. sies(s)ar-iya- ‘to filter, strain’, sesar-ul ‘sieve’, quoted by Dolgopolsky, are derived from the unattested noun *sie-ssar ‘sifting’, with the latter going back to IE *sē - ‘to sift’ with the well-known Hittite abstract suffix ssar.
29. siwi- ‘sour’ (said of bread). A hapax legomenon in OS, matching Akkad. emṣu ‘sour’ in the corresponding source. ◊ IE **se i, **si i- or **sV i.
√ Alt. *sìbi ‘bitter, bitter plant’: Tung. *sipa (~ b) ‘garlic’; Mong. *sibag ‘Artemisia, wormwood’; Turk. *sibüt ‘dill, coriander’; Jpn. *sìmpù- / *sìpZ- ‘1 astringent, tart; 2 salt’; Kor. *ps1- ‘1 liver / gall-bladder, gall; 2 bitter’. Ural. *šOwV ‘to sour’ or *čawV ‘sour; to become sour’ Kartv.: Georg. m-žav-e ‘sour’ (Климов—Халилов: 318). → Correspondences are regular (except for, perhaps, the vocalism of Ural. and Kartv. forms). Correctly etymologized in Dolgopolsky ND #2788 (Kartv. + Hitt. + Alt. + dubious Afras.). Cf. Nostratic stems with final r and similar meaning: Alt. *č obeŕV ‘salt; bitter, acid’, Alt. *s re ‘sour, acid, stinking’, IE *sūr- ‘sour; raw; damp’ (also IE *sour- ‘wet, damp’), Drav. *suvar ‘salt, brackishness; salty’, Kartv. *"ar- ‘bitter’.

30. t, ending of the instrumental case.13 Most likely, initially athematic, in the later texts with i-anaptyxis: it. In the New Hittite epoch super
13 Based on the intervocalic spelling with a single, not doubled consonant (e.g., OS KBo
17.17+ IV 12' g)]i-nu-ta-at-kán, i.e. ginut=at=kan ‘(let him take) it by the knee(s)’, and passim in
this text; OS HT 95 5' ku-un-ni-ta, i.e. kunnit=a ‘but by right (...)’; etc.), one could assert that
this ending goes back to Indo-Hittite *d or *dh rather than *t. As a matter of fact, there is
some evidence that in Hittite the final position was that of neutralization, in which all ob
struent consonants became voiced. Cf. pa-i-ta-aš (OH/NS KUB 28.4 obv. 11b, 22b), pa-a-i-ta-aš

The instrumental ending *-(a)ṭ must be kept apart from the sociative (comitative) markers of the shape oṭV or oḍV (Zvelebil Sketch: 33), which originate from the root *oḍ- (South *oḍ- ‘together with’, Telugu *oḍ- ‘to consent, agree’); the ṭ~ḍ variation in the sociative morphemes seems be the result of a late contamination with the instrumental *-(a)ṭ. Kartv. *-(i)t, ending of the instrumental case (Georg., Megr., Laz). → A Nostratic origin for the Hitt. ending was proposed already by Korolev (Королев ХЛЯ: 20). See further Dolgopolsky ND #2651, bringing together grammatical suffixes and prepositional/postpositional auxiliary words (very dubious Alt.: Tung. instrumental ending should be reconstructed as *-ǯi, further see EDAL: 221).

dary series”. The situation closely resembles Hurrian, where voicing of final obstruents is
established based on Ugaritic alphabetical texts. Kimball (HHP: 302) claims that the final
stops became devoiced in Hittite, but her sparse examples are not very convincing, since in
all these cases we may be dealing with the gemination-causing enclitic ya ‘and’. Unfortu
nately, Hittite forms in Ugaritic and Egyptian texts (see Patri 2009) do not provide any help
in solving this phonetic question.

Hitt. shows the same semantic shift as is observed in some Tungusic languages. See Nostret.dbf #1578 (Alt. + Ural.). Cf. also the two roots in Dolgopolsky ND #499 *dubʔV ‘back, hinder part, tail’ (Afras. + Ural. + Alt.), #2286 *tup'V ‘tail, back’ (Afras. + the same Ural. + dubious Alt. + dubious IE).

Korolev (Королев ХЛЯ: 20). The stem *tu is unparalleled within other Nostratic branches and seems an IndoHittite innovation. Cf. Dolgopolsky ND #2312; Kloekhorst // JIES 36/1–2 (2008): 93 (Anat. + Ural.).
35. tukk- (med.-pass.) ‘to be visible; to be appointed, defined; to be important, respected’. From MS and OH/NS on. ◊ IE **TV k, **Tuk- or theoretically **T Vk. ≠ No satisfactory cognates can be found within IE languages, except for Hsch. δεύκω · βλέπω ‘to see’, δεύκει · φροντίζει ‘to consider, reflect’ of unknown origin. Alb. duk-et ‘to appear’ seems to have been borrowed from MGrk./ NGrk. δοκεῖ ‘to seem’ (Orel AED: 78). The well attested Hitt. stem tuekka- ‘body (sg.); limbs (pl.)’ can be a non-obvious cognate of Hitt. tukk- ‘to be visible’, since the semantic shift ‘to be visible’ > ‘body’ has numerous typological parallels (but not vice versa: ‘body’ > ‘to be visible’ seems improbable). Alternately, despite irregularities in vocalism, tuekka- ‘body’ can be compared with IE *t ak- ‘skin’ (OInd. tvác- ‘skin’, Grk. σάκος ‘Schild (aus Leder)’), whose primary meaning was ‘skin’ (cf. supportive Nostratic cognates: Alt. *t +k e ‘hair [on body]’, ? Kartv. *ṭ aw- ~ *ṭ eb- ‘to skin, flay; hide’ with metathesis; see Nostret.dbf #208). IE *dhe gh- ‘berühren, drücken, melken’ (Pok.: 271) certainly does not belong here. √ Alt. *t+jk ú ‘to make a sign’: Tung. *duKū- ‘to write’; Mong. *doki- ‘to make a sign’; Turk. *Tūkrag ‘symbol of kingship’ [if here]; Jpn. *túnká- ‘to let know, inform’; Kor. *tj k- ‘to note down, to write’ (diphthong *ūj instead of simple ū is reconstructed on the basis of the diphthong *j in Kor.).

? Kartv. *tkw- ‘to speak, say’ or *ṭ w- ‘to recognize, notice’; wmetathesis and assimilation within a consonant cluster. → Hitt. Auslaut kk- instead of expected **-kku- (IE **-k , agreeing with Alt. *-k ̔u) should not confuse us, since it seems that the sequence *V K dissimilated > *V K in Indo-Hittite: there are no reliable Narrow IE or Indo-Hittite roots in *V K , except for *aukw(~ khw) ‘oven, cooking pot’ (Piet.dbf #17; Pok.: 88). Cf. Nostret.dbf #760 *tVjḳV ‘show, point at’ (IE *dei,- ‘to show’, Alt. *t+jk ú ‘to make a sign’, Ural. *täkkV ‘to look, observe’, ? Kartv. *ṭ w- ‘to recognize, notice’). And Dolgopolsky ND #2257 *tiḳ[ü] 'to show' (IE *dei,- + Kartv. *tkw- ‘to speak, say’ + very dubious Alt. + Afras.). Most likely, more than two Nostratic roots are represented here. Cf., e.g., the variety in IE: *de,‘to acquire, gain; respect, thank’ [Piet.dbf #1879, some forms should be excluded; WP I: 782]; *dok- ‘to teach, to show’ [Piet.dbf #1881; WP I: 782]; *de ,e- (~ /?) ‘to show’ [Piet.dbf #1869; WP I: 776]. U-tinged vocalism obliges us to treat Hitt. tukk- and Alt. *t+jk ú as a separate Nostratic root — *tu( )ḳV- ‘to make visible; to be visible (med.-pass.)’.
36. HLuw. uni- ‘to know; to recognize’, causative uni/a-nu- ‘to cause to know’. Cf. CLuw. unai- ‘to know(?)’. ◊ IE ** Vn- or **un.
√ Drav. *un- ‘to think, consider’: South *un- ‘to think, consider’, Telugu *uŋ-k- ‘to consider’, Brahui hunn-ing (hur, hutt) ‘to look, look at, look for, wait for, consider’. → Correspondences are regular.
37. wakk, wakk-ar- ‘to be absent, lack; to defect’. From MH/NS on. Cf. waks-iya-mi ‘to be scanty, scarce’ (if here) with unclear suffixation of s. ◊ IE ** ok- or ** ak- (~ *-5) .
≠ Oettinger’s comparison with Lat. vacō, vacāre ‘to be empty’ cannot be rejected (despite laryngealistic objections in EDHIL: 941). √ Alt. *uk i (~ e) ‘to die, be hungry’: Tung. *(x)uk-ti- ‘to be hungry’; Mong. *ükü- ‘to die’. → Correspondences are regular.



Anatolian lexical isolates and their external Nostratic cognates 175
38. *wanta- ‘heat; hot’ in want-ai-mi ‘to heat, warm; to be angry’, want-ess-mi ‘to become hot’, want-emma- c. ‘heat’, redupl. wante-want- ‘lightning’, and other derivates. From MH/NS on. Cf. CLuw. wantaniya- ‘flaming, blazing(?)’. EDHIL: 954 ff. proposes the translation ‘to glow, to light’, but I believe that the contexts quoted in EDHIL speak in favour of the old translation ‘to heat, warm’. ◊ IE ** onTo- (~ a) or perhaps ** To. √ Ural. *onta (*Onta) ‘warmth, heat’. Kartv. * went- ‘to melt’: Georg. vent- ‘to melt’, Megr. vant- ‘to melt’, Svan wēnt(il) ‘drop’. ? Drav. *vanḏ ‘to cook’: Telugu *vanḍ- ‘to cook, dress, boil, prepare’, Kolami-Gadba *vanḏ- ‘to cook’, Gondi-Kui *vanḏ- ‘to cook’. → Correspondences are standard, except for Kartv. * w- ~ Anatolian * — one would expect Anatolian **h - instead. The same correspondence is attested in Kartv. * wer- ‘to pour’ ~ Anatolian *wer/*wor ‘water’ (CLuw. war ‘water’ ~ Narrow IE *(e)wer- ‘water’): a phonetic law? Cf. also another Hitt. root with a close meaning, but different consonantal onset: the archaic s-stem hantais {hanta-¦-es} n. ‘heat’ (OS+) — to OIrish and- ‘to kindle’. Dolgopolsky ND #738 (Ural. + Kartv. + incorrect Hitt. hantais).
39. warhui- (i-st.) ‘overgrown (of road, mountain), hairy (of skin), with thick leaves (of tree)’. From MS and OS/NH on. ◊ IE ** orHu- (~ a) .
√ Alt. *:ro (~ u) ‘to grow’: Tung. *ure- ‘1 to grow; 2 sprout; 3 bush’; Mong. *urgu- ‘to grow’; Turk. *ur ‘growth, excrescence’; Jpn. *úrá‘to ripen’; Kor. *ōr ‘early ripening’. → Correspondences are regular. The Mong. form in *-rg- ( g- is treated as a suffix in EDAL) is extremely interesting in the light of Hitt. rh. Dolgopolsky (ND: 11) proposes Mong. *-^- and *-g-(?) as possible correspondences for Indo-Hittite *-H, but I have so far failed to find any reliable examples in Dolgoposky’s data.
40. *warka- c. ‘fat’ in adj. wark-ant- ‘fat’, wark-es- ‘to become fat’, warka-nu‘fatten (tr.)’. From OH/MS on. ◊ IE ** orK- (~ a) or perhaps ** K .



176 Alexei Kassian
≠ Sometimes the Hitt. root is connected to IE *wer( ) - ‘strength, force’: OInd. _rj, ūrj` f., ūrjá- m. ‘power, strength, vigor, sap’, ūrjá‘strong, powerful, eminent’, Grk. ὀργή ‘seelischer Trieb, Sinnesart, Charakter, (heftige) gemütsbewegung, Leidenschaft, Zorn’, OIr. ferc, ferg ‘Zorn’ (Pok. 1169, WP I 289, Piet.dbf #1226, Nostret.dbf #1162). However, Hitt. (i.e. Luwian) glossenkeil’ed :warku(i)‘wrath, anger (vel sim.)’ is a much more plausible cognate for IE *wer( ) .
√ Alt. * +ŕgi ‘fat; brain’: Tung. *irg[ü] ‘1 brain; 2 head’; Turk. *ǖŕ ‘fat’. → Correspondences are regular. Tung. shows the semantic development ‘fat’ > ‘bone marrow’ > ‘brain’.16
41. warra/i- c. ‘aid, help; auxiliary’, denominative warrai-mi / urrai-mi ‘to help’, warr-essa- ‘to provide aid’ (from MS on). CLuw. warrahit- ‘aid, help’. ◊ IE ** orH... (~ a) or perhaps ** H... Anatolian rr- points to an old cluster with *h, i.e. *rh > rr in the intervocalic position a_a(?), cf. Melchert AHP #4.1.6.1.1.3. ≠ Probably cognate is IE * er;- (* erHu) ‘to defend, to guard; to cover, to close’ (OInd. varū-tar ‘defender’, etc.; WP I: 280; Pok.: 1161).17 Apparently Hitt. warra/i- should not be connected to IE * er- ‘to observe, watch’ (WP I: 284; Pok.: 1164). For the latter, cf. rather Hitt. werida- ‘fear’ (at least = Lat. vereor ‘to show reverence or respect for; to fear’).
16 The polysemy ‘bone marrow’ ~ ‘brain’ is not unfrequent in languages around the
world. For ‘fat’ ~ ‘bone marrow’ cf., e.g., Akkad. lipû ‘1. adipose tissue, fat, tallow; 2. bone
marrow; 3 pitch’ < Sem. *li/apVʔ- ‘fatty, fleshy tissue’ (SED 1 #180), or, in the contrary direc
tion, Sem. *mu - ‘brain’ (SED 1 #187) > Hebrew mōăḥ ‘bone-marrow’, Phoenician mḥ ‘fat,
rich’ (adj.), Hebrew mēăḥ ‘fatling’.
17 If so, the phonetic development of Hittite warra- < * erH o- resembles the variants of
the Hitt. athematic verb tarh(u)-mi ‘to conquer, to be able, etc.’:
1) tarhu- in archaic texts (OS),
2) secondary tarh- in later texts due to the unification of the athematic declination pat
tern ( rh- is retained, since there is no intervocalic position in the main paradigmatic forms),
3) thematic med.-pass. tarra- (MH/NS on) ‘to be able’, showing rr.
The verbal stem tarh(u)-/tarra- goes back to IE *terHu, cf. esp. OInd. relict prs. taru-te
‘to pass’ and other forms in u.



Anatolian lexical isolates and their external Nostratic cognates 177
√ Drav. *ūṛ-i- ‘service; to serve’: South *ūṛ-i- ‘service’, Telugu *ūḍ-i‘service, drudgery, slavery’. Ural. *warV ‘to guard; to wait’: Ugric only (Mansi ōr, ūr, ur- ‘warten, sich hüten; hüten’, etc., Hungarian: vár- ‘warten, erwarten, harren’). → Correspondences are regular. The Hitt. meaning almost exactly matches Drav., whereas Ural. and Narrow IE show the development ‘to help’ > ‘to protect’. Nostret.dbf #1621 (Drav. + Ural. + unreasonably IE * er- ‘to observe’).
B. Dubia
42. *hassu- c. ‘king’ in various derivates. From OH on. ◊ IE **Hosu- (~ a) .
≠ Traditionally derived from the Hitt. verb hass- ‘to born’ and hassa‘progeny’. Typologically cf. Germ. *kuninʒaz ‘king’ and *kunjan ‘clan, tribe, race, generation, etc.’ from IE * o. √ Drav. *aǯǯ- ‘father, ancestor’. Alt. *ăčV ‘elder relative, ancestor’. Ural. *äćä ‘father’. → Etymologized in Dolgopolsky ND #797 (Drav. + Alt. + Ural. + Hitt.); Nostret.dbf #984. Nostratic stem is clearly a Lallwort, therefore dubious in any case.
43. he(y)u- c. ‘rain’ (from OS on), also in derivates. Probably the same morphophonological pattern as meyu- ‘4’ < Anat. *me u- (see above #18).
◊ IE **He u, **He .
≠ Traditionally to Toch. AB su, swā-s- ‘to rain’, Grk. ὕει ‘to rain’, i.e. IE *sH- with unexpected “s-mobile”. Alternatively to IE * he - ‘pour’ with the irregular fricativization * h > h in Anatolian. √ Kartv. * iw- ‘to cry, weep’: Georg. iv, Megr. i. → The Hitt. stem has interesting cognates within Afrasian: Egypt. ḥw.t ‘rain’ and Chadic forms (Siri hwíí, Somray Owā, etc.) with the same semantics (Takács EDE I: 46). This fact proves that the meaning of the Nostratic stem was ‘rain’. As for Kartv. ‘to weep’, the phonetic



178 Alexei Kassian
comparison with Hitt. heyu- is exact, but the meaning shift, however, is not self-evident. There are a lot of cases among the world's languages when ‘rain’ and ‘to cry’ originate from the same root ‘to pour’, but the semantic derivation ‘rain’ > ‘to cry’ requires reliable typological parallels. Cf. a rare example of similar derivation in the Yenisseian family, where the Common Yenisseian stems *xura ‘wet’ and *xur(a)-gV ‘to wash’ go back to Yen. *xur ‘rain’ (Yenet.dbf #772–774). Cf. Dolgopolsky ND #2611 (Hitt. + Afras.).
44. kaga- c. ‘tooth’. From MS on. ◊ IE **KoGo- (~ a) .
≠ Probably cognate is IE *k go, known from Germ. *xak-ōn ‘hook; bolt’, *xōka-z ‘hook; angle’ (Orel HGE: 154).18 Both directions of the assumed meaning shift are possible: ‘hook’ > ‘fang’ > ‘tooth’ / ‘hook’ > ‘bolt’ > ‘tooth’ or, vice versa, ‘tooth’ > ‘hook’. For general reasons the Hitt. anatomic meaning should be accepted as primary. √ Cf. Alt. *k ge ‘palate, jaw’: Tung. *xǖkte ‘tooth’; Mong. *kö emej ‘1 throat, pharynx; 2 chest part of animal skin’; Turk. *Kögme ‘gum (of tooth)’; Jpn. *k(ù)i ‘fang’; Kor. *kZhúm ‘jaw’. Alternately, cf. Alt. *kek V ‘palate, throat’: Tung. *kexere ‘hard palate’; Mong. *kekü- ‘1 throat cavity; 2 upper part of body, thorax’; Turk. *gekir-dek ‘throat, trachea, cartilage’. → Semantically tempting, but the phonetic correspondences between Hitt. and Alt. are quite irregular (poor vocalism in the case of Alt. *k ge and consonantism in the case of Alt. *kek V). Cf. also the great number of the roots with the shape KVKV and a general meaning ‘hook’ or ‘peg’ within in daughter languages of Nostratic.19
18 Cf. also the enigmatic Slav. form *kogъtь / *kokъtь (~ ъ) ‘claw (East Slav.); thorn (West
Slav.)’. It seems that the variant in *g- could have been formed by secondary analogy with
*nogъtь ‘nail’, or represent the same phenomenon as Russ. мягок < Slav. mękъkъ ‘mild’. Even
if *kogъt- reflects the primary shape, it cannot be directly compared with Germ. forms due to
violation of Winter’s law.
19 E.g., Alt. *gék á ‘hook, bend’, *g k à (~ o) ‘curve, hook; to cling to’, *k ōkí ‘hinge,
hook’; Drav. *kok- ‘beak, bill’; etc.



Anatolian lexical isolates and their external Nostratic cognates 179
45. kamm-ara- c. ‘mist, fog; shade; swarm (of bees)’. From OS on. ◊ IE **Ko/a... The stable spelling with mm- points to an old cluster *Tm or *mn.
≠ Traditionally to IE *5em- ‘to cover, to hide’ or to IE *kem- ‘to compress’ (HED K: 36). Semantically vague; geminated mm remains without an explanation. √ Ural. *kümtV- ‘fog, smoke’ (Иллич-Свитыч ОСНЯ 1 #187; Dolgopolsky ND #1067; as *küntV- in Uralet.dbf #312) → Etymologized in Dolgopolsky ND #1067, where Hitt. mm < Tm < mT via metathesis. Further cf. forms without the nasal (Nostret.dbf #581): Alt. *k ĕdò ‘wind, fog’, dubious IE *k(w)ed- ‘smoke’. Dolgopolsky adds Kartv. *ḳwam-/ḳwm- ‘to smoke (intr.)’ and Afras.
46. kutt- c. ‘wall’. CLuw. kuttassar ‘walling, wals’, HLuw. kutasara/i‘walls’.
◊ IE **KV t- or **k Vt.
≠ A t-formation from IE * he - ‘to pour’? Hardly to IE *kot- ‘shed, hut; room’ in view of *-u- in Anatolian. √ Drav. *gōḍ- ‘wall’: South *gōḍ-ai ‘wall’, Telugu *gōḍ-a ‘wall’, KolamiGadba *goḍ- ‘wall’. → Tempting, but the consonant correspondence Drav. *ḍ ~ IE *t is irregular. A possible North Cauc. source for the Hitt. word has been proposed in Николаев 1985: 63 — NCauc. * =wĭnd? ‘wall, fence’ > AvaroAndian *3: indV ‘wall’, Tsezian *qYd (~ e, ) ‘wall’, Lak q:at:a ‘house, room’, West Caucasian *  ́I V(n)da ‘fence’. This solution seems quite probable.
47. mask-an n. ‘bribe (given to officials); propitiatory gift (given to gods)’, iterative verb maski-ske- ‘to give presents to gods(?)’ (a hapax legomenon). From MH/MS on. ◊ IE **mosK- (~ a) .
≠ Puhvel (HED) analyzes mask- as a verbal stem containing the fossilized iterative suffix ske, i.e. *mag-ske, further to IE *mVgh, known from OInd. maghá- ‘gift’, Avest. maga- ‘(sacrificial) offering(?)’. However, Proto-Hittite normally retains the cluster ksk, albeit broken up through anaptyxis, as seen in, e.g., hueg-/hug- ‘to



180 Alexei Kassian
say an invocation’20 + ske- > *hukske- (with devoicing of the rootfinal stop) > Hitt. hukkiske, for details see Kassian & Yakubovich 2002: 37 ff. Thus, Proto-Hittite *mag-ske- should yield something like **makkiske- rather than maske.
√ Ural. *maksa ‘to give; to offer (a price)’ (Finno-Volgaic only): Fin. maksa- ‘zahlen, bezahlen; kosten’, Est. maks ‘tax; toll’, Saam. mak'se, maksē- etc. ‘to pay; payment’ (if not < Finn.), Mord. *maksu- ‘geben; bieten (einen Preis)’. → The comparison seems reliable both semantically and phonetically, if we accept a metathesis in Hitt. or Ural.
48. parstu- c. ‘leaf, foliage’ (certainly not ‘bud’, in all likelihood not ‘sprout/ shoot’, see the contexts in CHD). From OS on. Probably the basic word for ‘leaf’ (cf. also scarcely attested hurpasta-/hurpusta- ‘leaf, (onion) peel’).
◊ IE **PorsTu- (~ a) or **P sTu.
≠ Of possible interest are such forms as Slav. *brъstь/ъ ‘young sprout, bud’, OSax. brust-ian ‘aufbrechen, Knospen treiben’ (Heliand), NHD Brust ‘breast; rupture; bud’, if not to Germ. *brust- ‘to break’ (Köbler GWb, s.v. *brusti–2; perhaps to be kept apart from Germ. *brust-z ‘breast’). Slav. and Germ. forms point to IE *bhrust. As an emergency, one could compare the Hitt. stem with Germ. *berst‘to burst, break’, but the latter seems to be a Germanic-only metathetical variant of Germ. *brest- (Köbler GWb, s. v. *brestan). √ Kartv. *purć- ‘husks, foliage’ (Klimov EDKL: 207): Georg. purc-el‘leaf, foliage’, Megr. purča ‘chaff, husk’, Laz *purč- ‘a k. of weed’: purča ‘sweet corn ear’ (Benli Laz), purčumoli ‘edible sloe’ (Марр ГрЧан: 180), etc. Cf. also the Kartv. verb *prć-wn- ‘to peel’: Georg. + Megr. → Not very reliable in view of the ambiguity of Kartv. data. Note Kartv. *-ć- ~ Hitt. st.
A riskier etymology is present in Dolgopolsky ND: Hitt. root parto Nostr. #1767 *porV ‘leaf’ (IE + Alt. *púre ‘leaf, bud’ + scarce Drav. + Afras.) or #232 ‘bud, leaf’ (Hitt. + Ural. *pärV ‘bud’ + Afras.).
20 IE *H egh( ?), HED H: 327.



Anatolian lexical isolates and their external Nostratic cognates 181
49. pul n. ‘lot, lottery, жребий’. ◊ IE **PV l- or **P Vl.
≠ May be a cultural word. Cf. Akkad. pūru ‘lot, portion, plot; lot, lottery’. √ Alt. *p ŭle (~ i) ‘to be left, surplus’: Tung. *pule- ‘to be left, surplus’; Mong. *hüle- ‘1 surplus, to leave; 2 more than; 3 remain, get left’; Turk. *üle- ‘1 to divide, distribute, endow; 2 lot, endowment’. → Dubious.
50. purutt n. ‘1 mud, silt, sludge in its natural form; 2 finished mud ready to use for walls, roofs, etc., mudbrick; 3 dry earth, soil in its natural form’. From MS and OH/NS on. Seems obscure morphologically and looks like an old loan (Luwian or Hurrian), especially if the word was primarily used as a terminus technicus. Cf. Rieken StBoT 44: 160 ff., where it is regarded as a native formation. ◊ IE **Purut- or the same with **V / ** V. ≠ The most acceptable inner IE etymology is Grk. φύρω ‘to mix smth. dry w. smth. wet’ (as per Puhvel). √ Drav. *buṟad- ‘mud’: South *burud- (*-ṟ) ‘mud’, Telugu * burad- ‘mud, mire’, Kolami-Gadba *burd- (*-ṟ) ‘mud’, Gondi-Kui * buṟd- ‘mud’. → Dubious in view of the ambiguity of the Hittite stem. In any case, the etymology is to be separated from Nostret.dbf #39 ‘dust, ashes’: Drav. *buṛud- ‘dust, ashes’ ~ Alt. *b ru (~ a, o) ‘dust; smoke, whirlwind’ ~ Ural. *pora ‘dust’ (SKES 605) ~ Kartv. *bur( w)- ‘dust’ ~ Slav. *būrjā ‘storm, tempest’, Lat. furō ‘to be out of one’s mind; to rage with anger’.
51. sanh-mi ‘to clean, sweep’. From OS on. ◊ IE **sonH (~ a) or **s H.
≠ As a «Schwebe-ablaut» variant of IE *snaH- (OInd. snāti ‘baden’, Lat. nāre etc.)? √ Alt. *š ŋu ‘clear, light’: Tung. *šā(ŋ)- ‘white, become white’; Mong. *čaŋ ‘1 whitish, blond, grey (of hair); 2 white colour’; Turk. *čAŋ ‘1 morning dawn; 2 mist’; Jpn. *sùm- ‘to become clear, limpid’. → Dubious because of way too general semantics. Note M. Zhivlov’s correspondence Alt. *ŋ ~ Indo-Hittite *nH (Живлов 2007). One could expect Hitt. hu- in compliance with Alt. *-u. Cf. also Dolgopolsky ND #323 (very unlikely).



182 Alexei Kassian
52. sara- ‘woman’ (in compounds; from Cappadocian epoch on), CLuw. *asra/i- ‘woman’ (in derivates). ◊ IE **sor/**osr- (~ a).
√ Alt. *sara (~ *sero, *sura, *s ora, *z) ‘monkey’: Mong. *sar-magčin, *sar-bačin ‘monkey’; Jpn. *sàrû ‘monkey’. → Meaning shifts are possible, but unprovable: ‘woman’ < *’girl’ > ‘monkey’ or ‘female’ > ‘female monkey’ > ‘monkey’; very dubious as a result. Alternately cf. Kartv. *zur- ‘female’ — semantically exact, but Kartv. *z- ought to correspond to Indo-Hittite .
53. takkani- ‘breast (human male, animal)’ (from OS on). Hitt. takkaliya- ‘to embrace’ (from OS on) probably contains the same Anatolian root (*takk- ‘breast’) with a different suffix. ◊ IE **Tok- (~ a- ~ 5) .
√ Drav. *ḍok- (i.e. *Eḍok-?) ‘breastbone; chest; belly’: Telugu *ḍokk‘skeleton, belly’, Kolami-Gadba *ḍok- ‘bone’, Gondi-Kui *ḍok‘breastbone, chest’. → The vocalic correspondence Drav. *-o- ~ Indo-Hittite *-o- may be regular, but initial *ḍ- in Drav. should point to a non-inherited root or to loss of an onset vowel (*Vḍok). Николаев [1985: 64] (reiterated by Ivanov // ŠULMU: Papers on the Ancient Near East, 1988: 140) treats Hitt. takkani- ‘breast’ as a North Caucasian loan: Proto-Nakh *doḳ ‘heart’ (< Proto-North Caucasian *jĕrḳwĭ ‘heart’). This solution is attractive phonetically, but not very probable for general reasons. There is, indeed, a small number of Proto-Nakh loans in the Hittite lexicon, but it seems that all of them belong to the cultural vocabulary. We are not aware of any Hittite–Nakh contacts that would be intense enough to cause borrowing of items on the Swadesh wordlist.
54. (:)tissai, tessai-mi ‘to give right shape, to ready; to form up and march forth (e.g., troops)’. NH only?; sometimes glossenkeil’ed, therefore seems to be a Luwian stem. Cf. CLuw. tis(s)ai- ‘id.?’ ◊ IE **TV s.
√ Alt. *dasa ‘to regulate, govern’: Tung. *dasa- ‘to govern, regulate’; Mong. *das- ‘to get accustomed’; Turk. *jAsa- ‘1 to determine, gov

ern; 2 to create’; Kor. *tàs- ‘1 to govern, regulate; 2 to improve, order, correct’. → The vocalic correspondence IE *V ~ Alt. *a is irregular.
55. wattai- c. ‘bird (in general?)’. ◊ IE ** ot- (~ a) .
√ Drav. *ōḍ- ‘bird (in general); quail’: North Drav. *ōṛ-ā only. → IE *-t- ~ Drav. *-ḍ- is irregular.
