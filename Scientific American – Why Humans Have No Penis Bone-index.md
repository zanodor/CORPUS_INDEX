Why Humans Have No Penis Bone
Mating practices may help explain the mystery

One of the most weird and wonderful products of evolution is the
penis bone, or baculum. The baculum is an extra-skeletal bone,
which means it is not attached to the rest of the skeleton but instead
floats daintily at the end of the penis. Depending on the animal,
bacula range in size from under a millimetre to nearly a metre long,
and in shape, varying from needle-like spines to fork like prongs.
The walrus baculum, which could easily be mistaken for a 2ft-long
club, is around a sixth of its body length, whereas the diminutive
centimetre-long baculum of the ring-tailed lemur is only around a
40th of its body length.

Bacula are found in certain species of mammal, but not all. Most



primate males have a baculum, so humans are rather an oddity in
that they donʼt have one. In a handful of extraordinary
circumstances human males have formed bones in the soft tissue at
the end of their penises, but this is a rare abnormality, rather than a
baculum.
In a new study, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, my
colleague Kit Opie and I examined how the baculum developed in
mammals by studying how it is distributed across different species in
light of their pattern of descent (known as phylogenetics).
We showed that the baculum first evolved after placental and non
placental mammals split, around 145m years ago, but before the
most recent common ancestor of primates and carnivores evolved,
around 95m years ago. Our research also shows that the common
ancestor of primates and carnivores had a baculum. This means that
any species in these groups without a baculum, such as humans,
must have lost it over the course of evolution.
So, why on earth would an animal need a bone in their penis in the
first place? Scientists have come up with a few theories as to why a
baculum might be handy. In certain species, such as cats, a femaleʼs
body doesnʼt release its eggs until she mates, and some argue that
the baculum may help to stimulate females and trigger ovulation.
Another, somewhat colourfully named, theory is the vaginal friction
hypothesis. This essentially argues that the baculum acts as a
shoehorn, enabling a male to overcome any friction and squeeze
himself into a female.
Finally, it has been proposed that the baculum helps prolong
intromission, otherwise known as vaginal penetration. Far from
simply being a nice way to spend an afternoon, prolonging
intromission like this is a way for a male to prevent a female from



sneaking off and mating with anyone else before his sperm have had
a chance to work their magic. This theory brings a whole new
meaning to the term “cock-blocking”.

We found that, over the entire course of primate evolution, having a
baculum was linked to longer intromission durations (anything over
three minutes). On top of this, males of primate species with longer
intromission durations tend to have far longer bacula than males of
species where intromission is short.
Another interesting discovery was that males of species facing high
levels of sexual competition for females have longer bacula than
those facing lower levels of sexual competition.
But what about humans? If the penis bone is so important in
competing for a mate and prolonging copulation, then why donʼt we
have one? Well, the short answer to that is that humans donʼt quite
make it into the “prolonged intromission” category. The average
duration from penetration to ejaculation for human males is less than
two minutes.
But bonobos only copulate for about 15 seconds at a time and they
still have a baculum, even if it is very small (about 8mm). So what
makes us different? Itʼs possible that this comes down to our mating
strategies. Human males (generally) have minimal sexual competition
as females typically only mate with one male at a time. Perhaps the
adoption of this mating pattern, in addition to our short intromission
duration, was the last straw for the baculum.
Scientists are only just beginning to piece together the function of
this most unusual bone. What seems to be clear is that changes in
the primate baculum are driven, at least partly, by a speciesʼ mating



strategy. The picture that seems to be emerging is that, under high
levels of sexual competition, bigger is better when it comes to the
penis bone.
