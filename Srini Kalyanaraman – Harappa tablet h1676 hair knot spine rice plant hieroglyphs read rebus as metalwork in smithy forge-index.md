Pande, and Pitteri Koskikallio (2010) Corpus of Indus Seals and Inscriptions, Volume 3: New material, untraced objects, and collections outside India and Pakistan, Part 1: Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.

Steatite seal, intaglio. White fired steatite with a white core. Red speckling on interior below glaze level, slightly speckled on surface. Grinding marks visible on surface. Fragment of writing and top of animal motif remain - 2 or 3 signs are partially visible and 1 sign is complete (~”N”). The man with a double-bun hair style may be holding a trident or simply raising his hand. The animal motif is probably a tiger because of the multiple strokes. Anthropomorphic sign and animal direction facing to left (in impression) are rare.
Comment by SK: The animal is a 'unicorn' with a prominent ear and rings on neck commonly shown on thousands of 'one-horned young bull' field symbols on inscriptions.
